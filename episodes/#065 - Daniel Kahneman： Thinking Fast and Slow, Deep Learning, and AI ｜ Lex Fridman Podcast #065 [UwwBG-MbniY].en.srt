changed many people's views I think
 

177
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:49,729
changed many people's views I think
about about human beings certainly for

me the Ackman trial in a teaches you
 

181
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:56,330
me the Ackman trial in a teaches you
something because it's very clear that

182
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:56,340
something because it's very clear that
 

183
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:00,170
something because it's very clear that
if it could happen in Germany it could

184
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:00,180
if it could happen in Germany it could
 

185
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,660
if it could happen in Germany it could
happen anywhere it's not that the

186
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:02,670
happen anywhere it's not that the
 

187
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:04,760
happen anywhere it's not that the
Germans were special this could happen

195
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:18,050
we're all capable of cruelty I don't
think in those terms I think that what

196
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:18,060
think in those terms I think that what
 

197
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,340
think in those terms I think that what
is certainly possible

198
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:19,350
is certainly possible
 

199
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:23,719
is certainly possible
is you can dehumanize people so that

200
00:04:23,719 --> 00:04:23,729
is you can dehumanize people so that
 

201
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:25,730
is you can dehumanize people so that
there you treat them

202
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:25,740
there you treat them
 

203
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,850
there you treat them
not as people anymore but as animals and

204
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:28,860
not as people anymore but as animals and
 

205
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:32,270
not as people anymore but as animals and
and the same way that you can slaughter

206
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:32,280
and the same way that you can slaughter
 

207
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,230
and the same way that you can slaughter
animals without feeling much of anything

208
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:35,240
animals without feeling much of anything
 

209
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,320
animals without feeling much of anything
it can the same and when you feel that

210
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:39,330
it can the same and when you feel that
 

211
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:44,140
it can the same and when you feel that
the I think the combination of

00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:44,150
the I think the combination of
 

213
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,760
the I think the combination of
dehumanizing the other side and and

nature so that Nazi soldier you know he

222
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:01,250
nature so that Nazi soldier you know he
 

223
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:04,969
nature so that Nazi soldier you know he
he was a good man I mean you know and he

224
00:05:04,969 --> 00:05:04,979
he was a good man I mean you know and he
 

225
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:07,460
he was a good man I mean you know and he
was perfectly capable of killing a lot

226
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:07,470
was perfectly capable of killing a lot
 

227
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,680
was perfectly capable of killing a lot
of people and I'm sure he did

228
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:09,690
of people and I'm sure he did
 

229
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:13,070
of people and I'm sure he did
but what what did the Jewish people mean

230
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:13,080
but what what did the Jewish people mean
 

231
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:17,719
but what what did the Jewish people mean
to Nazis so what the dismissal of Jewish

232
00:05:17,719 --> 00:05:17,729
to Nazis so what the dismissal of Jewish
 

233
00:05:17,729 --> 00:05:22,640
to Nazis so what the dismissal of Jewish
as well worthy of again this is

234
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:22,650
as well worthy of again this is
 

235
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:25,399
as well worthy of again this is
surprising that it was so extreme but

236
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:25,409
surprising that it was so extreme but
 

237
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:29,059
surprising that it was so extreme but
it's not one thing in human nature I

238
00:05:29,059 --> 00:05:29,069
it's not one thing in human nature I
 

239
00:05:29,069 --> 00:05:31,520
it's not one thing in human nature I
don't want to call it evil but the

240
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:31,530
don't want to call it evil but the
 

241
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,529
don't want to call it evil but the
distinction between the in-group and the

242
00:05:33,529 --> 00:05:33,539
distinction between the in-group and the
 

243
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:36,379
distinction between the in-group and the
out-group that is very basic

244
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:36,389
out-group that is very basic
 

245
00:05:36,389 --> 00:05:40,219
out-group that is very basic
so that's built in the the loyalty and

246
00:05:40,219 --> 00:05:40,229
so that's built in the the loyalty and
 

247
00:05:40,229 --> 00:05:42,740
so that's built in the the loyalty and
affection towards in-group and the

248
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:42,750
affection towards in-group and the
 

249
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,550
affection towards in-group and the
willingness to dehumanize the out-group

250
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:45,560
willingness to dehumanize the out-group
 

251
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:49,189
willingness to dehumanize the out-group
that's that is in human nature and

252
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:49,199
that's that is in human nature and
 

253
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:54,379
that's that is in human nature and
that's that's what I think probably

254
00:05:54,379 --> 00:05:54,389
that's that's what I think probably
 

255
00:05:54,389 --> 00:05:56,149
that's that's what I think probably
didn't need the Holocaust to teach us

256
00:05:56,149 --> 00:05:56,159
didn't need the Holocaust to teach us
 

257
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:58,879
didn't need the Holocaust to teach us
that but the Holocaust is a very sharp

258
00:05:58,879 --> 00:05:58,889
that but the Holocaust is a very sharp
 

259
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:01,490
that but the Holocaust is a very sharp
lesson of you know what can happen to

260
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:01,500
lesson of you know what can happen to
 

261
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:06,469
lesson of you know what can happen to
people and when the people can do so the

262
00:06:06,469 --> 00:06:06,479
people and when the people can do so the
 

263
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,080
people and when the people can do so the
effect of the in-group and the out-group

264
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:08,090
effect of the in-group and the out-group
 

265
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:12,110
effect of the in-group and the out-group
you know that it's clear that those were

266
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:12,120
you know that it's clear that those were
 

267
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,060
you know that it's clear that those were
people you know you could you could

268
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:14,070
people you know you could you could
 

269
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:16,370
people you know you could you could
shoot them you could you know they were

270
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:16,380
shoot them you could you know they were
 

271
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,890
shoot them you could you know they were
not human they were not there was no

272
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:18,900
not human they were not there was no
 

273
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,959
not human they were not there was no
empathy or very very little empathy left

274
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:22,969
empathy or very very little empathy left
 

275
00:06:22,969 --> 00:06:26,060
empathy or very very little empathy left
so occasionally you know they might have

276
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:26,070
so occasionally you know they might have
 

277
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:31,550
so occasionally you know they might have
been and and very quickly by the way the

278
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:31,560
been and and very quickly by the way the
 

279
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,290
been and and very quickly by the way the
empathy disappeared if there was

280
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:33,300
empathy disappeared if there was
 

281
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,750
empathy disappeared if there was
initially and the fact that everybody

282
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:35,760
initially and the fact that everybody
 

283
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,280
initially and the fact that everybody
around you was doing it

284
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:38,290
around you was doing it
 

285
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:42,420
around you was doing it
that that completely the group doing it

286
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:42,430
that that completely the group doing it
 

287
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:47,270
that that completely the group doing it
and everybody shooting Jews I think that

288
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:47,280
and everybody shooting Jews I think that
 

289
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:53,270
and everybody shooting Jews I think that
that makes it permissible now how much

290
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:53,280
that makes it permissible now how much
 

291
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,280
that makes it permissible now how much
you know whether it would it could

292
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:56,290
you know whether it would it could
 

293
00:06:56,290 --> 00:07:00,210
you know whether it would it could
happen or in every culture or whether

294
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:00,220
happen or in every culture or whether
 

295
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,010
happen or in every culture or whether
the Germans were just particularly

296
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:02,020
the Germans were just particularly
 

297
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:05,340
the Germans were just particularly
efficient and and disciplined so they

298
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:05,350
efficient and and disciplined so they
 

299
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:08,730
efficient and and disciplined so they
could get away with it that is a

300
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:08,740
could get away with it that is a
 

301
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,170
could get away with it that is a
question it's an interesting question

302
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:10,180
question it's an interesting question
 

303
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,690
question it's an interesting question
are these artifacts of history or is it

304
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:12,700
are these artifacts of history or is it
 

305
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,390
are these artifacts of history or is it
human nature I think that's really human

306
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:15,400
human nature I think that's really human
 

307
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:19,230
human nature I think that's really human
nature you know you put some people in a

308
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:19,240
nature you know you put some people in a
 

309
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,300
nature you know you put some people in a
position of power relative to other

310
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:21,310
position of power relative to other
 

311
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:26,000
position of power relative to other
people and and then they become as human

312
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,010
people and and then they become as human
 

313
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:29,880
people and and then they become as human
become different but in general and war

314
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:29,890
become different but in general and war
 

315
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:32,610
become different but in general and war
outside of concentration camps in World

316
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:32,620
outside of concentration camps in World
 

317
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,270
outside of concentration camps in World
War two

318
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:33,280
War two
 

319
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,350
War two
it seems that war brings out darker

320
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:37,360
it seems that war brings out darker
 

321
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,090
it seems that war brings out darker
sides of human nature but also the

sides of human nature but also the
 

323
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,250
sides of human nature but also the
beautiful things about human nature well

324

beautiful things about human nature well
 

325
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:45,200
beautiful things about human nature well
no I mean but it what it brings out is

326
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:45,210
no I mean but it what it brings out is
 

327
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:49,350
no I mean but it what it brings out is
the loyalty among soldiers I mean it

328
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:49,360
the loyalty among soldiers I mean it
 

329
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,320

brings out the bonding male bonding I

330
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:52,330
brings out the bonding male bonding I
 

331
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:55,440
brings out the bonding male bonding I
think is a very real thing that and that

332
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:55,450
think is a very real thing that and that
 

333
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:57,990
think is a very real thing that and that
happens and so and and there is a

334
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:58,000
happens and so and and there is a
 

335
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,570
happens and so and and there is a
student of thrill to friendship and

336
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:00,580
student of thrill to friendship and
 

337
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,000
student of thrill to friendship and
there is certainly a certain thrill to

338
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,010
there is certainly a certain thrill to
 

339
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:05,820
there is certainly a certain thrill to
friendship under risk and to shared risk

340
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:05,830
friendship under risk and to shared risk
 

341
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:08,990
friendship under risk and to shared risk
and so people have very profound

342
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:09,000
and so people have very profound
 

343
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,480
and so people have very profound
emotions up to the point where it gets

so traumatic that that little is left
 

347
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:21,630
so traumatic that that little is left
but so let's talk about psychology a

00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:21,640
but so let's talk about psychology a

little bit in your book Thinking Fast
 

351
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:27,210
little bit in your book Thinking Fast
and Slow you described two modes of

371
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:55,269

very useful but what I call system one

some algorithm in your heads and yes and
and it takes time it's a very difference

and it takes time it's a very difference

00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:52,250
mean that you've got to perform and then
 

411
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,639
mean that you've got to perform and then
it's work and it engages short-term

memory and thing ages executive function
 

415
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,040
memory and thing ages executive function
and it makes you incapable of doing

416
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:00,050
and it makes you incapable of doing
 

417
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:03,490
and it makes you incapable of doing
other things at the same time so the the

418
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:03,500
other things at the same time so the the
 

419
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,340
other things at the same time so the the
main characteristic of system 2 is that

420
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:06,350
main characteristic of system 2 is that
 

421
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:08,259
main characteristic of system 2 is that
there is mental effort involved and

422
00:10:08,259 --> 00:10:08,269
there is mental effort involved and
 

423
00:10:08,269 --> 00:10:10,300
there is mental effort involved and
there is a limited capacity for mental

424
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:10,310
there is a limited capacity for mental
 

425
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,519
there is a limited capacity for mental
effort where a system one is effortless

426
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:12,529
effort where a system one is effortless
 

427
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:15,490
effort where a system one is effortless
essentially that's the major distinction

428
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:15,500
essentially that's the major distinction
 

429
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,939
essentially that's the major distinction
so you talk about there you know it's

430
00:10:18,939 --> 00:10:18,949
so you talk about there you know it's
 

431
00:10:18,949 --> 00:10:20,410
so you talk about there you know it's
really convenient to talk about two

really convenient to talk about two

00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:23,410
really convenient to talk about two

and in general that there's no distinct

evolutionary theory saying about this is
cheap and easier so it's the way I think

464
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:11,370
cheap and easier so it's the way I think
 

465
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:14,690
cheap and easier so it's the way I think
about it is that it's very clear that

466
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:14,700
about it is that it's very clear that
 

467
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:19,130
about it is that it's very clear that
animals have a perceptual system and

468

animals have a perceptual system and
 

469
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,500
animals have a perceptual system and
that includes an ability to understand

that includes an ability to understand
 

471
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:24,410
that includes an ability to understand
the world at least to the extent that

they can predict they can't explain
anything but they can anticipate what's

00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,720
anything but they can anticipate what's
going to happen and that's the key form

going to happen and that's the key form

00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:37,250

00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:40,720
of understanding the world and my crude
idea is that we would I call system -

482
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:40,730
idea is that we would I call system -
 

483
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:45,949
idea is that we would I call system -
well system - grew out of this and you

484
00:11:45,949 --> 00:11:45,959
well system - grew out of this and you
 

485
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:48,319
well system - grew out of this and you
know there is language and there is the

486
00:11:48,319 --> 00:11:48,329
know there is language and there is the
 

487
00:11:48,329 --> 00:11:50,780
know there is language and there is the
capacity of manipulating our ideas and

488
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:50,790
capacity of manipulating our ideas and
 

489
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:53,780
capacity of manipulating our ideas and
the capacity of imagining futures and of

490
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:53,790
the capacity of imagining futures and of
 

491
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:56,720
the capacity of imagining futures and of
imagining counterfactuals thing that

492
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:56,730
imagining counterfactuals thing that
 

493
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:59,120
imagining counterfactuals thing that
haven't happened and and to do

494
00:11:59,120 --> 00:11:59,130
haven't happened and and to do
 

495
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:01,100
haven't happened and and to do
conditional thinking and there are

496
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:01,110
conditional thinking and there are
 

497
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:05,090
conditional thinking and there are
really a lot of abilities that without

498
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:05,100
really a lot of abilities that without
 

499
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,970
really a lot of abilities that without
language and without the the very large

500
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:07,980
language and without the the very large
 

501
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,490
language and without the the very large
brain that we have compared to others it

502
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:10,500
brain that we have compared to others it
 

503
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,490
brain that we have compared to others it
would be impossible now

504
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:13,500
would be impossible now
 

505
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,490
would be impossible now
system one is more like what the animals

506
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:16,500
system one is more like what the animals
 

507
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:21,079
system one is more like what the animals
are but system one also can talk I mean

508
00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:21,089
are but system one also can talk I mean
 

509
00:12:21,089 --> 00:12:23,630
are but system one also can talk I mean
it has language it understands language

510
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:23,640
it has language it understands language
 

511
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,569
it has language it understands language
indeed it speaks for us I mean you know

512
00:12:26,569 --> 00:12:26,579
indeed it speaks for us I mean you know
 

513
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,579
indeed it speaks for us I mean you know
I'm not choosing every word you know as

514
00:12:28,579 --> 00:12:28,589
I'm not choosing every word you know as
 

515
00:12:28,589 --> 00:12:31,850
I'm not choosing every word you know as
a deliberate process the words I have

516
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:31,860
a deliberate process the words I have
 

517
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,680
a deliberate process the words I have
some idea and then the words come out

518
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:33,690
some idea and then the words come out
 

519
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:37,360
some idea and then the words come out
and that's automatic and effortless and

520
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:37,370
and that's automatic and effortless and
 

521
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:39,680
and that's automatic and effortless and
many of experiments you've done is to

522
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:39,690
many of experiments you've done is to
 

523
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:42,530
many of experiments you've done is to
show that listen system won't exist and

524
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:42,540
show that listen system won't exist and
 

525
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,120
show that listen system won't exist and
it does speak for us and we should be

526
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:44,130
it does speak for us and we should be
 

527
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:47,510
it does speak for us and we should be
careful about it's the voice it provides

528
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:47,520
careful about it's the voice it provides
 

529
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,750
careful about it's the voice it provides
well it's I mean you know we have to

530
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:50,760
well it's I mean you know we have to
 

531
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:56,180
well it's I mean you know we have to
trust it because it's the speed at which

532
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:56,190
trust it because it's the speed at which
 

533
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:59,600
trust it because it's the speed at which
it acts a system is usable if we if we

534
00:12:59,600 --> 00:12:59,610
it acts a system is usable if we if we
 

535
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:02,000
it acts a system is usable if we if we
depend on one system to for survival we

536
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,010
depend on one system to for survival we
 

537
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:04,130
depend on one system to for survival we
wouldn't survive very long because it's

538
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:04,140
wouldn't survive very long because it's
 

539
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:06,259
wouldn't survive very long because it's
very slow yeah crossing the street

540
00:13:06,259 --> 00:13:06,269
very slow yeah crossing the street
 

541
00:13:06,269 --> 00:13:08,150
very slow yeah crossing the street
crossing a street I mean many things

542
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:08,160
crossing a street I mean many things
 

543
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,720
crossing a street I mean many things
depend on there being automatic one very

544
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:11,730
depend on there being automatic one very
 

545
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:13,939
depend on there being automatic one very
important aspect of system one is that

546
00:13:13,939 --> 00:13:13,949
important aspect of system one is that
 

547
00:13:13,949 --> 00:13:15,330
important aspect of system one is that
it's not instinct

548
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:15,340
it's not instinct
 

549
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,970
it's not instinct
you use the word instinct that it

550
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:17,980
you use the word instinct that it
 

551
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:21,060
you use the word instinct that it
contains skills that clearly have been

552
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:21,070
contains skills that clearly have been
 

553
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:24,420
contains skills that clearly have been
learned so that skilled behavior like

554
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:24,430
learned so that skilled behavior like
 

555
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:28,220
learned so that skilled behavior like
driving a car or speaking in fact

556
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:28,230
driving a car or speaking in fact
 

557
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:31,640
driving a car or speaking in fact
skilled behavior has to be learned and

558
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:31,650
skilled behavior has to be learned and
 

559
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:34,260
skilled behavior has to be learned and
so it doesn't you know you don't come

560
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:34,270
so it doesn't you know you don't come
 

561
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:36,900
so it doesn't you know you don't come
equipped with with driving you have to

562
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:36,910
equipped with with driving you have to
 

563
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:39,630
equipped with with driving you have to
learn how to drive and and you have to

564
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:39,640
learn how to drive and and you have to
 

565
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,820
learn how to drive and and you have to
go through a period where driving is not

566
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:41,830
go through a period where driving is not
 

567
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:45,750
go through a period where driving is not
automatic before it becomes automatic

568
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:45,760
automatic before it becomes automatic
 

569
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,570
automatic before it becomes automatic
so yeah you construct I mean this is

570
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:48,580
so yeah you construct I mean this is
 

571
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,860
so yeah you construct I mean this is
where you talk about heuristic and

572
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:49,870
where you talk about heuristic and
 

573
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:55,050
where you talk about heuristic and
biases you to make it automatic you

574
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:55,060
biases you to make it automatic you
 

575
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,600
biases you to make it automatic you
create a pattern and then system one

576
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:57,610
create a pattern and then system one
 

577
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:00,180
create a pattern and then system one
essentially matches a new experience

578
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:00,190
essentially matches a new experience
 

579
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:02,100
essentially matches a new experience
against a previously seen pattern and

580
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:02,110
against a previously seen pattern and
 

581
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:04,470
against a previously seen pattern and
when that match is not a good one that's

582
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:04,480
when that match is not a good one that's
 

583
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,120
when that match is not a good one that's
when the cognate all of them all the

584
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:06,130
when the cognate all of them all the
 

585
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:08,220
when the cognate all of them all the
mess happens but it's most of the time

586
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:08,230
mess happens but it's most of the time
 

587
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:10,410
mess happens but it's most of the time
it works and so it's pretty most of the

588
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:10,420
it works and so it's pretty most of the
 

589
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:13,200
it works and so it's pretty most of the
time the anticipation of what's going to

590
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:13,210
time the anticipation of what's going to
 

591
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:16,230
time the anticipation of what's going to
happen next is correct and and most of

592
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:16,240
happen next is correct and and most of
 

593
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,200
happen next is correct and and most of
the time the plan about what you have to

594
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:19,210
the time the plan about what you have to
 

595
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:22,579
the time the plan about what you have to
do is correct and so most of the time

596
00:14:22,579 --> 00:14:22,589
do is correct and so most of the time
 

597
00:14:22,589 --> 00:14:25,590
do is correct and so most of the time
everything works just fine what's

598
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:25,600
everything works just fine what's
 

599
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,590
everything works just fine what's
interesting actually is that in some

600
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:28,600
interesting actually is that in some
 

601
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,320
interesting actually is that in some
sense system one is much better at what

602
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:31,330
sense system one is much better at what
 

603
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:32,220
sense system one is much better at what
it does

604
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:32,230
it does
 

605
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:35,670
it does
and system tool is at what it does that

606
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:35,680
and system tool is at what it does that
 

607
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,130
and system tool is at what it does that
is there is that quality of effortlessly

608
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:38,140
is there is that quality of effortlessly
 

609
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,590
is there is that quality of effortlessly
solving enormous ly complicated problems

610
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:40,600
solving enormous ly complicated problems
 

611
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:45,300
solving enormous ly complicated problems
which clearly exists so that the chess

612
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:45,310
which clearly exists so that the chess
 

613
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:49,620
which clearly exists so that the chess
player a very good chess player all the

614
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:49,630
player a very good chess player all the
 

615
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:52,170
player a very good chess player all the
moves that come to their mind are strong

616
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:52,180
moves that come to their mind are strong
 

617
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:55,020
moves that come to their mind are strong
moves so all the selection of strong

618
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:55,030
moves so all the selection of strong
 

619
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:57,960
moves so all the selection of strong
moves happens unconsciously and

620
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:57,970
moves happens unconsciously and
 

621
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:01,380
moves happens unconsciously and
automatically and very very fast and and

622
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:01,390
automatically and very very fast and and
 

623
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:03,930
automatically and very very fast and and
all that is in system one so you a

624
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:03,940
all that is in system one so you a
 

625
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:08,340
all that is in system one so you a
system two verifies so along this line

626
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:08,350
system two verifies so along this line
 

627
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:10,770
system two verifies so along this line
of thinking really what we are our

628
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:10,780
of thinking really what we are our
 

629
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:13,079
of thinking really what we are our
machines that construct a pretty

630
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:13,089
machines that construct a pretty
 

631
00:15:13,089 --> 00:15:16,680
machines that construct a pretty
effective system one you could think of

632
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:16,690
effective system one you could think of
 

633
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:18,540
effective system one you could think of
it that way so so we're now talking

634
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:18,550
it that way so so we're now talking
 

635
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,160
it that way so so we're now talking
about humans but if we think about

636
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:20,170
about humans but if we think about
 

637
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:23,630
about humans but if we think about
building artificial intelligence systems

638
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:23,640
building artificial intelligence systems
 

639
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:27,510
building artificial intelligence systems

743
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,880
mean he what he points out and I think
he has a point is that humans learn

successful but you know reasoning by
itself doesn't get you much deep

800
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:34,450
itself doesn't get you much deep
 

801
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:35,880
itself doesn't get you much deep
learning has been much more successful

802
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:35,890
learning has been much more successful
 

803
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:38,279
learning has been much more successful
in terms of you know what they can do

804
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:38,289
in terms of you know what they can do
 

805
00:19:38,289 --> 00:19:41,970
in terms of you know what they can do
but now it's an interesting question

806
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:41,980
but now it's an interesting question
 

807
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,220
but now it's an interesting question
whether its approaching its limits what

808
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:44,230
whether its approaching its limits what
 

809
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:47,399
whether its approaching its limits what
do you think I think absolutely so I

810
00:19:47,399 --> 00:19:47,409
do you think I think absolutely so I
 

811
00:19:47,409 --> 00:19:50,159
do you think I think absolutely so I
just talked to John laocoon he mentioned

812
00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:50,169
just talked to John laocoon he mentioned
 

813
00:19:50,169 --> 00:19:52,880
just talked to John laocoon he mentioned
you know I know him so he thinks that

814
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:52,890
you know I know him so he thinks that
 

815
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:54,960
you know I know him so he thinks that
the limits were

816
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:54,970
the limits were
 

817
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:56,970
the limits were
not going to hit the limits with you all

818
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:56,980
not going to hit the limits with you all
 

819
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:59,190
not going to hit the limits with you all
networks that ultimately this kind of

820
00:19:59,190 --> 00:19:59,200
networks that ultimately this kind of
 

821
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,789
networks that ultimately this kind of
system on pattern matching will start to

822
00:20:01,789 --> 00:20:01,799
system on pattern matching will start to
 

823
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:05,549
system on pattern matching will start to
start to look like system two with

824
00:20:05,549 --> 00:20:05,559
start to look like system two with
 

825
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:08,490
start to look like system two with
without significant transformation of

826
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:08,500
without significant transformation of
 

827
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,100
without significant transformation of
the architecture so I'm more with the

828
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:11,110
the architecture so I'm more with the
 

829
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:13,140
the architecture so I'm more with the
but the majority of the people who think

830
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:13,150
but the majority of the people who think
 

831
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:15,180
but the majority of the people who think
that yes new all networks will hit a

832
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:15,190
that yes new all networks will hit a
 

833
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:18,510
that yes new all networks will hit a
limit in their capability he on the one

834
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:18,520
limit in their capability he on the one
 

835
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,960
limit in their capability he on the one
hand I have heard him tell the missus

836
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:21,970
hand I have heard him tell the missus
 

837
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,970
hand I have heard him tell the missus
obvious essentially that you know what

838
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:23,980
obvious essentially that you know what
 

839
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,409
obvious essentially that you know what
they have accomplished it's not a big

840
00:20:25,409 --> 00:20:25,419
they have accomplished it's not a big
 

841
00:20:25,419 --> 00:20:27,750
they have accomplished it's not a big
deal that they have just touched that

842
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:27,760
deal that they have just touched that
 

843
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,360
deal that they have just touched that
basically you know they can't do

844
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:30,370
basically you know they can't do
 

845
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:33,390
basically you know they can't do
unsupervised learning in in an effective

846
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:33,400
unsupervised learning in in an effective
 

847
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,240
unsupervised learning in in an effective
way and but you're telling me that he

848
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:36,250
way and but you're telling me that he
 

849
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,789
way and but you're telling me that he
thinks that the current within the

850
00:20:38,789 --> 00:20:38,799
thinks that the current within the
 

851
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,740
thinks that the current within the
current architecture you can do

852
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:40,750
current architecture you can do
 

853
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,169
current architecture you can do
causality and reasoning so he's very

854
00:20:43,169 --> 00:20:43,179
causality and reasoning so he's very
 

855
00:20:43,179 --> 00:20:46,200
causality and reasoning so he's very
much a pragmatist in a sense that saying

856
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:46,210
much a pragmatist in a sense that saying
 

857
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:47,640
much a pragmatist in a sense that saying
that were very far away that they're

858
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:47,650
that were very far away that they're
 

859
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:49,710
that were very far away that they're
still yeah I think there's this idea

860
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:49,720
still yeah I think there's this idea
 

861
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:54,539
still yeah I think there's this idea
that he says is uh we can only see one

862
00:20:54,539 --> 00:20:54,549
that he says is uh we can only see one
 

863
00:20:54,549 --> 00:20:56,549
that he says is uh we can only see one
or two mountain peaks ahead and there

864
00:20:56,549 --> 00:20:56,559
or two mountain peaks ahead and there
 

865
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,919
or two mountain peaks ahead and there
might be either a few more after or

866
00:20:58,919 --> 00:20:58,929
might be either a few more after or
 

867
00:20:58,929 --> 00:21:01,590
might be either a few more after or
thousands more after yeah so that kind

868
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:01,600
thousands more after yeah so that kind
 

869
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:06,330
thousands more after yeah so that kind
of idea right but nevertheless it

870
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:06,340
of idea right but nevertheless it
 

871
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:11,539
of idea right but nevertheless it
doesn't see a the final answer not

872
00:21:11,539 --> 00:21:11,549
doesn't see a the final answer not
 

873
00:21:11,549 --> 00:21:13,890
doesn't see a the final answer not
fundamentally looking like one that we

874
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:13,900
fundamentally looking like one that we
 

875
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:14,549
fundamentally looking like one that we
currently have

876
00:21:14,549 --> 00:21:14,559
currently have
 

877
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:17,789
currently have
so neural networks being a huge part

878
00:21:17,789 --> 00:21:17,799
so neural networks being a huge part
 

879
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:20,940
so neural networks being a huge part
that you know I mean that's very likely

880
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:20,950
that you know I mean that's very likely
 

881
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:24,299
that you know I mean that's very likely
because because pattern matching is so

882
00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:24,309
because because pattern matching is so
 

883
00:21:24,309 --> 00:21:27,270
because because pattern matching is so
much of what's going on and you can

884
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:27,280
much of what's going on and you can
 

885
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,100
much of what's going on and you can
think of neural networks as processing

886
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:29,110
think of neural networks as processing
 

887
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:31,620
think of neural networks as processing
information sequentially yeah I mean you

888
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:31,630
information sequentially yeah I mean you
 

889
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:35,430
information sequentially yeah I mean you
know there is there is an important

890
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:35,440
know there is there is an important
 

891
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,970
know there is there is an important
aspect to for example you get systems

892
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:38,980
aspect to for example you get systems
 

893
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:41,250
aspect to for example you get systems
that translate and they do a very good

894
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:41,260
that translate and they do a very good
 

895
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,799
that translate and they do a very good
job but they really don't know what

896
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:43,809
job but they really don't know what
 

897
00:21:43,809 --> 00:21:47,700
job but they really don't know what
they're talking about and and and for

898
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:47,710
they're talking about and and and for
 

899
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:50,130
they're talking about and and and for
that I'm really quite surprised for that

900
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:50,140
that I'm really quite surprised for that
 

901
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:54,810
that I'm really quite surprised for that
you would need you would need an AI that

902
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:54,820
you would need you would need an AI that
 

903
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:57,270
you would need you would need an AI that
has sensation an AI that is in touch

904
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:57,280
has sensation an AI that is in touch
 

905
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:01,080
has sensation an AI that is in touch
with the world awareness and maybe even

906
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:01,090
with the world awareness and maybe even
 

907
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:03,960
with the world awareness and maybe even
something resembles consciousness kind

908
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:03,970
something resembles consciousness kind
 

909
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:06,240
something resembles consciousness kind
of ideas li awareness of you know

910
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:06,250
of ideas li awareness of you know
 

911
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,320
of ideas li awareness of you know
awareness of what's going on so

912
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:08,330
awareness of what's going on so
 

913
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:11,110
awareness of what's going on so
that the the words have meaning who can

914
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:11,120
that the the words have meaning who can
 

915
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:15,039
that the the words have meaning who can
get are in touch with some perception or

916
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:15,049
get are in touch with some perception or
 

917
00:22:15,049 --> 00:22:18,039
get are in touch with some perception or
some action yeah so that's a big thing

918
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:18,049
some action yeah so that's a big thing
 

919
00:22:18,049 --> 00:22:21,159
some action yeah so that's a big thing
for yarn and as well here first is

920
00:22:21,159 --> 00:22:21,169
for yarn and as well here first is
 

921
00:22:21,169 --> 00:22:24,399
for yarn and as well here first is
grounding to the physical space so so

922
00:22:24,399 --> 00:22:24,409
grounding to the physical space so so
 

923
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:26,110
grounding to the physical space so so
that's what we're talking about the same

924
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:26,120
that's what we're talking about the same
 

925
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:29,860
that's what we're talking about the same
yeah so but so how you ground I mean the

926
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:29,870
yeah so but so how you ground I mean the
 

927
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:33,190
yeah so but so how you ground I mean the
grounding without grounding then you get

928
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:33,200
grounding without grounding then you get
 

929
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,110
grounding without grounding then you get
you get a machine that doesn't know what

930
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:35,120
you get a machine that doesn't know what
 

931
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,480
you get a machine that doesn't know what
it's talking about because it is talking

932
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:37,490
it's talking about because it is talking
 

933
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:40,659
it's talking about because it is talking
about the world ultimately the question

934
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:40,669
about the world ultimately the question
 

935
00:22:40,669 --> 00:22:42,549
about the world ultimately the question
open question is what it means to ground

936
00:22:42,549 --> 00:22:42,559
open question is what it means to ground
 

937
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:46,120
open question is what it means to ground
I mean we're very human centric in our

938
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:46,130
I mean we're very human centric in our
 

939
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:48,370
I mean we're very human centric in our
thinking but what does it mean for a

940
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:48,380
thinking but what does it mean for a
 

941
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:50,379
thinking but what does it mean for a
machine to understand what it means to

942
00:22:50,379 --> 00:22:50,389
machine to understand what it means to
 

943
00:22:50,389 --> 00:22:53,620
machine to understand what it means to
be in this world does it need to have a

944
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:53,630
be in this world does it need to have a
 

945
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:56,289
be in this world does it need to have a
body does he need to have a finiteness

946
00:22:56,289 --> 00:22:56,299
body does he need to have a finiteness
 

947
00:22:56,299 --> 00:22:58,690
body does he need to have a finiteness
like we humans have all of these

948
00:22:58,690 --> 00:22:58,700
like we humans have all of these
 

949
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:02,500
like we humans have all of these
elements it's very nice to know I'm you

950
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:02,510
elements it's very nice to know I'm you
 

951
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:04,060
elements it's very nice to know I'm you
know I'm not sure about having a body

952
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:04,070
know I'm not sure about having a body
 

953
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:06,399
know I'm not sure about having a body
but having a perceptual system having a

954
00:23:06,399 --> 00:23:06,409
but having a perceptual system having a
 

955
00:23:06,409 --> 00:23:09,490
but having a perceptual system having a
body would be very helpful to me if if

956
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:09,500
body would be very helpful to me if if
 

957
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,399
body would be very helpful to me if if
you think about human mimicking human

958
00:23:12,399 --> 00:23:12,409
you think about human mimicking human
 

959
00:23:12,409 --> 00:23:15,970
you think about human mimicking human
ooh but having a perception that seems

960
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:15,980
ooh but having a perception that seems
 

961
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:20,289
ooh but having a perception that seems
to be central so that you can build you

962
00:23:20,289 --> 00:23:20,299
to be central so that you can build you
 

963
00:23:20,299 --> 00:23:22,240
to be central so that you can build you
can accumulate knowledge about the world

964
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:22,250
can accumulate knowledge about the world
 

965
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:26,019
can accumulate knowledge about the world
so if you can you can imagine a human

966
00:23:26,019 --> 00:23:26,029
so if you can you can imagine a human
 

967
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:29,139
so if you can you can imagine a human
completely paralyzed and there's a lot

968
00:23:29,139 --> 00:23:29,149
completely paralyzed and there's a lot
 

969
00:23:29,149 --> 00:23:31,509
completely paralyzed and there's a lot
that the human brain could learn you

970
00:23:31,509 --> 00:23:31,519
that the human brain could learn you
 

971
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:35,320
that the human brain could learn you
know with a paralyzed body so if we got

972
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:35,330
know with a paralyzed body so if we got
 

973
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:38,110
know with a paralyzed body so if we got
a machine that could do that it would be

974
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:38,120
a machine that could do that it would be
 

975
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:41,049
a machine that could do that it would be
a big deal and then the flip side of

976
00:23:41,049 --> 00:23:41,059
a big deal and then the flip side of
 

977
00:23:41,059 --> 00:23:43,690
a big deal and then the flip side of
that something you see in children and

978
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:43,700
that something you see in children and
 

979
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,759
that something you see in children and
something in machine learning world is

980
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:45,769
something in machine learning world is
 

981
00:23:45,769 --> 00:23:48,899
something in machine learning world is
called active learning maybe it is is

982
00:23:48,899 --> 00:23:48,909
called active learning maybe it is is
 

983
00:23:48,909 --> 00:23:52,899
called active learning maybe it is is
being able to play with the world how

984
00:23:52,899 --> 00:23:52,909
being able to play with the world how
 

985
00:23:52,909 --> 00:23:56,129
being able to play with the world how
important for developing system owners

986
00:23:56,129 --> 00:23:56,139
important for developing system owners
 

987
00:23:56,139 --> 00:23:58,899
important for developing system owners
or system to do you think it is to play

988
00:23:58,899 --> 00:23:58,909

the brain to learn new patterns so you
 

1011
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:29,680
the brain to learn new patterns so you
know it's the kind of thing that you get

00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:17,390
that's a very good answer I think that
 

1045
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:20,230
that's a very good answer I think that

00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:27,850
Ray Kurzweil is saying that strikes me
as of the war but but I think people are

1050
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:27,860
as of the war but but I think people are
 

1051
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,500
as of the war but but I think people are
much more realistic than that were

1052
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:29,510
much more realistic than that were
 

1053

actually they Mesa sabe is and Yanis and
 

1055
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,590
actually they Mesa sabe is and Yanis and
so the people are actually doing the

1056
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:35,600
so the people are actually doing the
 

1057
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:40,060
so the people are actually doing the
work fairly realistic I think - maybe

00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:40,070
work fairly realistic I think - maybe

1114
00:27:02,779 --> 00:27:02,789
able to you know they're able to get
 

1115
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:06,080
able to you know they're able to get
into a roundabout and into the end to

1116
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:06,090
into a roundabout and into the end to
 

1117
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:11,570
into a roundabout and into the end to
traffic so they must know both to expect

1118
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:11,580
traffic so they must know both to expect
 

1119
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,610
traffic so they must know both to expect
though to anticipate how people will

1120
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:13,620
though to anticipate how people will
 

1121
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:16,100
though to anticipate how people will
react when they're sneaking in and

1122
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:16,110
react when they're sneaking in and
 

1123
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:17,990
react when they're sneaking in and
there's a lot of learning that's

1124
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:18,000
there's a lot of learning that's
 

1125
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,019
there's a lot of learning that's
involved in that currently the

1126
00:27:21,019 --> 00:27:21,029
involved in that currently the
 

1127
00:27:21,029 --> 00:27:24,169
involved in that currently the
pedestrians are treated as things that

1128
00:27:24,169 --> 00:27:24,179
pedestrians are treated as things that
 

1129
00:27:24,179 --> 00:27:30,139
pedestrians are treated as things that
cannot be hid and not treated as agents

1130
00:27:30,139 --> 00:27:30,149
cannot be hid and not treated as agents
 

1131
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:32,930
cannot be hid and not treated as agents
with whom you interact in a game

1132
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:32,940
with whom you interact in a game
 

1133
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:37,430
with whom you interact in a game
theoretic way so I mean it's not it's a

1134
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:37,440
theoretic way so I mean it's not it's a
 

1135
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,320
theoretic way so I mean it's not it's a
totally open problem and every time

1136
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:39,330
totally open problem and every time
 

1137
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:40,730
totally open problem and every time
somebody tries to solve it it seems to

1138
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:40,740
somebody tries to solve it it seems to
 

1139
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:43,669
somebody tries to solve it it seems to
be harder than we think and nobody's

1140
00:27:43,669 --> 00:27:43,679
be harder than we think and nobody's
 

1141
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:45,409
be harder than we think and nobody's
really tried to seriously solve the

1142
00:27:45,409 --> 00:27:45,419
really tried to seriously solve the
 

1143
00:27:45,419 --> 00:27:48,440
really tried to seriously solve the
problem of that dance because I'm not

1144
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:48,450
problem of that dance because I'm not
 

1145
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:49,760
problem of that dance because I'm not
sure if you've thought about the problem

1146
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:49,770
sure if you've thought about the problem
 

1147
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:52,909
sure if you've thought about the problem
of pedestrians but you're really putting

1148
00:27:52,909 --> 00:27:52,919
of pedestrians but you're really putting
 

1149
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:55,789
of pedestrians but you're really putting
your life in the hands of the driver you

1150
00:27:55,789 --> 00:27:55,799
your life in the hands of the driver you
 

1151
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,950
your life in the hands of the driver you
know there is a dance as part of the

1152
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:57,960
know there is a dance as part of the
 

1153
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,460
know there is a dance as part of the
dance

1154
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:58,470
dance
 

1155
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:01,580
dance
that would be quite complicated but for

1156
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:01,590
that would be quite complicated but for
 

1157
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:03,470
that would be quite complicated but for
example when I cross the street and

1158
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:03,480
example when I cross the street and
 

1159
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,960
example when I cross the street and
there is vehicle approaching I look the

1160
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:05,970
there is vehicle approaching I look the
 

1161
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:08,180
there is vehicle approaching I look the
driver in the eye and I think many

1162
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:08,190
driver in the eye and I think many
 

1163
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:09,049
driver in the eye and I think many
people do that

1164
00:28:09,049 --> 00:28:09,059
people do that
 

1165
00:28:09,059 --> 00:28:13,070
people do that
and you know that's a signal that that

1166
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:13,080
and you know that's a signal that that
 

1167
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,019
and you know that's a signal that that
I'm sending and I would be sending that

1168
00:28:15,019 --> 00:28:15,029
I'm sending and I would be sending that
 

1169
00:28:15,029 --> 00:28:17,899
I'm sending and I would be sending that
machine to an autonomous vehicle and it

1170
00:28:17,899 --> 00:28:17,909
machine to an autonomous vehicle and it
 

1171
00:28:17,909 --> 00:28:20,000
machine to an autonomous vehicle and it
had better understand it because it

1172
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,010
had better understand it because it
 

1173
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:22,610
had better understand it because it
means I'm crossing so and there's

1174
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:22,620
means I'm crossing so and there's
 

1175
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:25,639
means I'm crossing so and there's
another thing you do that actually so

1176
00:28:25,639 --> 00:28:25,649
another thing you do that actually so
 

1177
00:28:25,649 --> 00:28:27,320
another thing you do that actually so
I'll tell you what you do because we

1178
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:27,330
I'll tell you what you do because we
 

1179
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:29,930
I'll tell you what you do because we
watch I've watched hundreds of hours of

1180
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:29,940
watch I've watched hundreds of hours of
 

1181
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:32,269
watch I've watched hundreds of hours of
video on this is when you step in the

1182
00:28:32,269 --> 00:28:32,279
video on this is when you step in the
 

1183
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:33,980
video on this is when you step in the
street you do that before you step on

1184
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:33,990
street you do that before you step on
 

1185
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:35,690
street you do that before you step on
the street and when you step in the

1186
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:35,700
the street and when you step in the
 

1187
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,820
the street and when you step in the
street you actually look awake away yeah

1188
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:37,830
street you actually look awake away yeah
 

1189
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:42,770
street you actually look awake away yeah
yeah now what what is it what the saying

1190
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:42,780
yeah now what what is it what the saying
 

1191
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:45,409
yeah now what what is it what the saying
is mean you're trusting that the car who

1192
00:28:45,409 --> 00:28:45,419
is mean you're trusting that the car who
 

1193
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:48,509
is mean you're trusting that the car who
hasn't slowed down yet will slow down

1194
00:28:48,509 --> 00:28:48,519
hasn't slowed down yet will slow down
 

1195
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:50,609
hasn't slowed down yet will slow down
and you're telling him yeah I'm

1196
00:28:50,609 --> 00:28:50,619
and you're telling him yeah I'm
 

1197
00:28:50,619 --> 00:28:52,859
and you're telling him yeah I'm
committed yeah I mean this is like in a

1198
00:28:52,859 --> 00:28:52,869
committed yeah I mean this is like in a
 

1199
00:28:52,869 --> 00:28:55,799
committed yeah I mean this is like in a
game of chicken so I'm committed and if

1200
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:55,809
game of chicken so I'm committed and if
 

1201
00:28:55,809 --> 00:28:58,109
game of chicken so I'm committed and if
I'm committed I'm looking away so there

1202
00:28:58,109 --> 00:28:58,119
I'm committed I'm looking away so there
 

1203
00:28:58,119 --> 00:29:01,169
I'm committed I'm looking away so there
is you you just have to stop so the

1204
00:29:01,169 --> 00:29:01,179
is you you just have to stop so the
 

1205
00:29:01,179 --> 00:29:03,329
is you you just have to stop so the
question is whether a machine that

1206
00:29:03,329 --> 00:29:03,339
question is whether a machine that
 

1207
00:29:03,339 --> 00:29:05,359
question is whether a machine that
observes that needs to understand

1208
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:05,369
observes that needs to understand
 

1209
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:09,659
observes that needs to understand
mortality here I'm not sure that it's

1210
00:29:09,659 --> 00:29:09,669
mortality here I'm not sure that it's
 

1211
00:29:09,669 --> 00:29:13,649
mortality here I'm not sure that it's
got to understand so much it's got to

1212
00:29:13,649 --> 00:29:13,659
got to understand so much it's got to
 

1213
00:29:13,659 --> 00:29:19,739
got to understand so much it's got to
anticipate so and here but you know

1214
00:29:19,739 --> 00:29:19,749
anticipate so and here but you know
 

1215
00:29:19,749 --> 00:29:23,039
anticipate so and here but you know
you're surprising me because here I

1216
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:23,049
you're surprising me because here I
 

1217
00:29:23,049 --> 00:29:24,659
you're surprising me because here I
would think that maybe you can

1218
00:29:24,659 --> 00:29:24,669
would think that maybe you can
 

1219
00:29:24,669 --> 00:29:27,539
would think that maybe you can
anticipate without understanding because

1220
00:29:27,539 --> 00:29:27,549
anticipate without understanding because
 

1221
00:29:27,549 --> 00:29:30,269
anticipate without understanding because
I think this is clearly what's happening

1222
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:30,279
I think this is clearly what's happening
 

1223
00:29:30,279 --> 00:29:32,249
I think this is clearly what's happening
in playing go or in playing trace

1224
00:29:32,249 --> 00:29:32,259
in playing go or in playing trace
 

1225
00:29:32,259 --> 00:29:34,499
in playing go or in playing trace
there's a lot of anticipation and there

1226
00:29:34,499 --> 00:29:34,509
there's a lot of anticipation and there
 

1227
00:29:34,509 --> 00:29:40,169
there's a lot of anticipation and there
is zero understanding so I thought that

1228
00:29:40,169 --> 00:29:40,179
is zero understanding so I thought that
 

1229
00:29:40,179 --> 00:29:43,949
is zero understanding so I thought that
you didn't need a model of the human yes

1230
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:43,959
you didn't need a model of the human yes
 

1231
00:29:43,959 --> 00:29:46,799
you didn't need a model of the human yes
and the model of the human mind to avoid

1232
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:46,809
and the model of the human mind to avoid
 

1233
00:29:46,809 --> 00:29:49,889
and the model of the human mind to avoid
hitting pedestrians but you are

1234
00:29:49,889 --> 00:29:49,899
hitting pedestrians but you are
 

1235
00:29:49,899 --> 00:29:53,369
hitting pedestrians but you are
suggesting that I do yeah you do as and

1236
00:29:53,369 --> 00:29:53,379
suggesting that I do yeah you do as and
 

1237
00:29:53,379 --> 00:29:56,399
suggesting that I do yeah you do as and
then it's then it's a lot harder so this

1238
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:56,409
then it's then it's a lot harder so this
 

1239
00:29:56,409 --> 00:29:58,560
then it's then it's a lot harder so this
is all and I have a follow-up question

1240
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:58,570
is all and I have a follow-up question
 

1241
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:01,619
is all and I have a follow-up question
to see where your intuition lies is it

1242
00:30:01,619 --> 00:30:01,629
to see where your intuition lies is it
 

1243
00:30:01,629 --> 00:30:04,169
to see where your intuition lies is it
seems that almost every robot human

1244
00:30:04,169 --> 00:30:04,179
seems that almost every robot human
 

1245
00:30:04,179 --> 00:30:07,079
seems that almost every robot human
collaboration system is a lot harder

1246
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:07,089
collaboration system is a lot harder
 

1247
00:30:07,089 --> 00:30:11,219
collaboration system is a lot harder
than people realize so do you think it's

1248
00:30:11,219 --> 00:30:11,229
than people realize so do you think it's
 

1249
00:30:11,229 --> 00:30:13,079
than people realize so do you think it's
possible for robots and humans to

1250
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:13,089
possible for robots and humans to
 

1251
00:30:13,089 --> 00:30:17,129
possible for robots and humans to
collaborate successfully if we talked a

1252
00:30:17,129 --> 00:30:17,139
collaborate successfully if we talked a
 

1253
00:30:17,139 --> 00:30:18,389
collaborate successfully if we talked a
little bit about semi autonomous

1254
00:30:18,389 --> 00:30:18,399
little bit about semi autonomous
 

1255
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:22,379
little bit about semi autonomous
vehicles like in the Tesla autopilot but

1256
00:30:22,379 --> 00:30:22,389
vehicles like in the Tesla autopilot but
 

1257
00:30:22,389 --> 00:30:27,060
vehicles like in the Tesla autopilot but
just in tasks in general if you think we

1258
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:27,070
just in tasks in general if you think we
 

1259
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:28,529
just in tasks in general if you think we
talked about current you'll know where

1260
00:30:28,529 --> 00:30:28,539
talked about current you'll know where
 

1261
00:30:28,539 --> 00:30:30,419
talked about current you'll know where
it's being kind of system one do you

1262
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:30,429
it's being kind of system one do you
 

1263
00:30:30,429 --> 00:30:35,269
it's being kind of system one do you
think those same systems can borrow

1264
00:30:35,269 --> 00:30:35,279
think those same systems can borrow
 

1265
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:39,289
think those same systems can borrow
humans for system to type tasks and

1266
00:30:39,289 --> 00:30:39,299
humans for system to type tasks and
 

1267
00:30:39,299 --> 00:30:42,810
humans for system to type tasks and
collaborate successfully well I think

1268
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:42,820
collaborate successfully well I think
 

1269
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:47,249
collaborate successfully well I think
that in any system where humans and the

1270
00:30:47,249 --> 00:30:47,259
that in any system where humans and the
 

1271
00:30:47,259 --> 00:30:49,949
that in any system where humans and the
Machine interact that the human will be

1272
00:30:49,949 --> 00:30:49,959
Machine interact that the human will be
 

1273
00:30:49,959 --> 00:30:52,560
Machine interact that the human will be
superfluous within a fairly short time

1274
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:52,570
superfluous within a fairly short time
 

1275
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:55,769
superfluous within a fairly short time
and that is if the Machine has advanced

1276
00:30:55,769 --> 00:30:55,779
and that is if the Machine has advanced
 

1277
00:30:55,779 --> 00:30:58,319
and that is if the Machine has advanced
enough so that it can really help the

1278
00:30:58,319 --> 00:30:58,329
enough so that it can really help the
 

1279
00:30:58,329 --> 00:31:01,379
enough so that it can really help the
human then it may not need the human for

1280
00:31:01,379 --> 00:31:01,389
human then it may not need the human for
 

1281
00:31:01,389 --> 00:31:01,860
human then it may not need the human for
a long

1282
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:01,870
a long
 

1283
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:06,029
a long
now it would be very interesting if if

1284
00:31:06,029 --> 00:31:06,039
now it would be very interesting if if
 

1285
00:31:06,039 --> 00:31:07,860
now it would be very interesting if if
there are problems that for some reason

1286
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:07,870
there are problems that for some reason
 

1287
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:10,919
there are problems that for some reason
the machine doesn't you're not so but

1288
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:10,929
the machine doesn't you're not so but
 

1289
00:31:10,929 --> 00:31:13,260
the machine doesn't you're not so but
that people could solve then you would

1290
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:13,270
that people could solve then you would
 

1291
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:14,850
that people could solve then you would
have to build into the machine and

1292
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:14,860
have to build into the machine and
 

1293
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:18,539
have to build into the machine and
ability to recognize that it is in that

1294
00:31:18,539 --> 00:31:18,549
ability to recognize that it is in that
 

1295
00:31:18,549 --> 00:31:22,350
ability to recognize that it is in that
kind of problematic situation and and to

1296
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:22,360
kind of problematic situation and and to
 

1297
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:26,060
kind of problematic situation and and to
call the human that that cannot be easy

1298
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:26,070
call the human that that cannot be easy
 

1299
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:29,549
call the human that that cannot be easy
without understanding that is its it

1300
00:31:29,549 --> 00:31:29,559
without understanding that is its it
 

1301
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:33,539
without understanding that is its it
must be very difficult to to program a

1302
00:31:33,539 --> 00:31:33,549
must be very difficult to to program a
 

1303
00:31:33,549 --> 00:31:35,970
must be very difficult to to program a
recognition that you are in a

1304
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:35,980
recognition that you are in a
 

1305
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:38,039
recognition that you are in a
problematic situation without

1306
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:38,049
problematic situation without
 

1307
00:31:38,049 --> 00:31:41,580
problematic situation without
understanding the problem but that's

1308
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:41,590
understanding the problem but that's
 

1309
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:45,210
understanding the problem but that's
very true in order to understand the

1310
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:45,220
very true in order to understand the
 

1311
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,830
very true in order to understand the
full scope of situations that are

1312
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:46,840
full scope of situations that are
 

1313
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:49,590
full scope of situations that are
problematic you almost need to be smart

1314
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:49,600
problematic you almost need to be smart
 

1315
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,580
problematic you almost need to be smart
enough to solve all those problems it's

1316
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:53,590
enough to solve all those problems it's
 

1317
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:57,419
enough to solve all those problems it's
not clear to me how much the machine

1318
00:31:57,419 --> 00:31:57,429
not clear to me how much the machine
 

1319
00:31:57,429 --> 00:32:00,930
not clear to me how much the machine
will need the human I think the example

1320
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:00,940
will need the human I think the example
 

1321
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,850
will need the human I think the example
of chess is very instructive I mean

1322
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:02,860
of chess is very instructive I mean
 

1323
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:04,919
of chess is very instructive I mean
there was a time at which Kasparov was

1324
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:04,929
there was a time at which Kasparov was
 

1325
00:32:04,929 --> 00:32:07,380
there was a time at which Kasparov was
saying that human machine combinations

1326
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:07,390
saying that human machine combinations
 

1327
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:10,620
saying that human machine combinations
will beat everybody even stockfish

1328
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:10,630
will beat everybody even stockfish
 

1329
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:13,740
will beat everybody even stockfish
doesn't need people yeah and alpha zero

1330
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:13,750
doesn't need people yeah and alpha zero
 

1331
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:16,110
doesn't need people yeah and alpha zero
certainly doesn't need people the

1332
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:16,120
certainly doesn't need people the
 

1333
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,539
certainly doesn't need people the
question is just like you said how many

1334
00:32:18,539 --> 00:32:18,549
question is just like you said how many
 

1335
00:32:18,549 --> 00:32:20,880
question is just like you said how many
problems are like chess and how many

1336
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:20,890
problems are like chess and how many
 

1337
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:23,430
problems are like chess and how many
problems are the ones where are not like

1338
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:23,440
problems are the ones where are not like
 

1339
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,590
problems are the ones where are not like
chess where even well every problem

1340
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:25,600
chess where even well every problem
 

1341
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,480
chess where even well every problem
probably in the end is like chess the

1342
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:27,490
probably in the end is like chess the
 

1343
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:29,399
probably in the end is like chess the
question is how long is that transition

1344
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:29,409
question is how long is that transition
 

1345
00:32:29,409 --> 00:32:32,039
question is how long is that transition
period I mean you know that that's a

1346
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:32,049
period I mean you know that that's a
 

1347
00:32:32,049 --> 00:32:35,639
period I mean you know that that's a
question I would ask you in terms of men

1348
00:32:35,639 --> 00:32:35,649
question I would ask you in terms of men
 

1349
00:32:35,649 --> 00:32:37,980
question I would ask you in terms of men
autonomous vehicle just driving is

1350
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:37,990
autonomous vehicle just driving is
 

1351
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:39,990
autonomous vehicle just driving is
probably a lot more complicated than go

1352
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:40,000
probably a lot more complicated than go
 

1353
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,080
probably a lot more complicated than go
to solve that yes and that's surprising

1354
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:43,090
to solve that yes and that's surprising
 

1355
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:46,260
to solve that yes and that's surprising
because it's open no I mean you know I

1356
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:46,270
because it's open no I mean you know I
 

1357
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:48,149
because it's open no I mean you know I
couldn't that's not surprising to me

1358
00:32:48,149 --> 00:32:48,159
couldn't that's not surprising to me
 

1359
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:53,399
couldn't that's not surprising to me
because the because that there is a

1360
00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:53,409
because the because that there is a
 

1361
00:32:53,409 --> 00:32:56,639
because the because that there is a
hierarchical aspect to this which is

1362
00:32:56,639 --> 00:32:56,649
hierarchical aspect to this which is
 

1363
00:32:56,649 --> 00:32:59,760
hierarchical aspect to this which is
recognizing a situation and then within

1364
00:32:59,760 --> 00:32:59,770
recognizing a situation and then within
 

1365
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:02,669
recognizing a situation and then within

the situation bringing bringing up the
 

1367
00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:08,340

hierarchical type of system to work you

1370
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:12,640
hierarchical type of system to work you
 

1371
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,630
hierarchical type of system to work you
need a more complicated system

1372
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:14,640
need a more complicated system
 

1373
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,110
need a more complicated system
currently a lot of people think because

1374
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:18,120
currently a lot of people think because
 

1375
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,900
currently a lot of people think because
as human beings this is probably the the

1376
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:20,910
as human beings this is probably the the
 

1377
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:23,480
as human beings this is probably the the
cognitive biases they think of driving

1378
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:23,490
cognitive biases they think of driving
 

1379
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:26,810
cognitive biases they think of driving
is pretty simple because they think of

1380
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:26,820
is pretty simple because they think of
 

1381
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:29,110
is pretty simple because they think of
their own experience this is actually a

1382
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:29,120
their own experience this is actually a
 

1383
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,120
their own experience this is actually a
big problem for aai researchers or

1384
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:32,130
big problem for aai researchers or
 

1385
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:35,410
big problem for aai researchers or
people thinking about AI because they

1386
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:35,420
people thinking about AI because they
 

1387
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:37,760
people thinking about AI because they
evaluate how hard a particular problem

1388
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:37,770
evaluate how hard a particular problem
 

1389
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:42,140
evaluate how hard a particular problem
is based on very limited knowledge but

1390
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:42,150
is based on very limited knowledge but
 

1391
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:44,840
is based on very limited knowledge but
basically how hard it is for them to do

1392
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:44,850
basically how hard it is for them to do
 

1393
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:46,970
basically how hard it is for them to do
the task yeah and then they take for

1394
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:46,980
the task yeah and then they take for
 

1395
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:48,950
the task yeah and then they take for
granted I mean maybe you can speak to

1396
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:48,960
granted I mean maybe you can speak to
 

1397
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,100
granted I mean maybe you can speak to
that because most people tell me driving

1398
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:52,110
that because most people tell me driving
 

1399
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:55,880
that because most people tell me driving
is trivial and and humans in fact are

1400
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:55,890
is trivial and and humans in fact are
 

1401
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:57,500
is trivial and and humans in fact are
terrible at driving is what people tell

1402
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:57,510
terrible at driving is what people tell
 

1403
00:33:57,510 --> 00:34:00,350
terrible at driving is what people tell
me and I see humans and humans are

1404
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:00,360
me and I see humans and humans are
 

1405
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,940
me and I see humans and humans are
actually incredible at driving and

1406
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:01,950
actually incredible at driving and
 

1407
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:03,620
actually incredible at driving and
driving is really terribly difficult

1408
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:03,630
driving is really terribly difficult
 

1409
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:07,910
driving is really terribly difficult
yeah so is that just another element of

1410
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:07,920
yeah so is that just another element of
 

1411
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,649
yeah so is that just another element of
the effects that you've described in

1412
00:34:09,649 --> 00:34:09,659
the effects that you've described in
 

1413
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:15,530
the effects that you've described in
your work on the psychology side oh no I

1414
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:15,540
your work on the psychology side oh no I
 

1415
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:18,830
your work on the psychology side oh no I
mean I haven't really you know I I would

1416
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:18,840
mean I haven't really you know I I would
 

1417
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,389
mean I haven't really you know I I would
say that my research has contributed

1418
00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:20,399
say that my research has contributed
 

1419
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:23,230
say that my research has contributed
nothing to understanding the ecology

1420
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:23,240
nothing to understanding the ecology
 

1421
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,580
nothing to understanding the ecology
into understanding the structure of

1422
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:25,590
into understanding the structure of
 

1423
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:27,950
into understanding the structure of
situations yeah and the complexity of

1424
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:27,960
situations yeah and the complexity of
 

1425
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:33,050
situations yeah and the complexity of
problems so all all we know is very

1426
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:33,060
problems so all all we know is very
 

1427
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:37,730
problems so all all we know is very
clear that that go it's endlessly

1428
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:37,740
clear that that go it's endlessly
 

1429
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:41,120
clear that that go it's endlessly
complicated but it's very constrained so

1430
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:41,130
complicated but it's very constrained so
 

1431
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:44,899
complicated but it's very constrained so
and in the real world there are far

1432
00:34:44,899 --> 00:34:44,909
and in the real world there are far
 

1433
00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:47,360
and in the real world there are far
fewer constraints and and many more

1434
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:47,370
fewer constraints and and many more
 

1435
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:51,139
fewer constraints and and many more
potential surprises so so that's

1436
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:51,149
potential surprises so so that's
 

1437
00:34:51,149 --> 00:34:52,490
potential surprises so so that's
obviously because it's not always

1438
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:52,500
obviously because it's not always
 

1439
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,560
obviously because it's not always
obvious to people right so when you

1440
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:54,570
obvious to people right so when you
 

1441
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:56,389
obvious to people right so when you
think about well I mean you know people

1442
00:34:56,389 --> 00:34:56,399
think about well I mean you know people
 

1443
00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:00,620
think about well I mean you know people
thought that reasoning was hard and

1444
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:00,630
thought that reasoning was hard and
 

1445
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:04,040
thought that reasoning was hard and
perceiving was easy but you know they

1446
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:04,050
perceiving was easy but you know they
 

1447
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:07,430
perceiving was easy but you know they
quickly learned that actually modeling

1448
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:07,440
quickly learned that actually modeling
 

1449
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,160
quickly learned that actually modeling
vision was tremendously complicated and

1450
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:10,170
vision was tremendously complicated and
 

1451
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:13,610
vision was tremendously complicated and
modelling even proving theorems was

1452
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:13,620
modelling even proving theorems was
 

1453
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:17,000
modelling even proving theorems was
relatively straightforward to push back

1454
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:17,010
relatively straightforward to push back
 

1455
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:18,800

decades to learn that and most people
 

1461
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:25,640

the simple answer and it's going to take
 

1517
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:57,360
the simple answer and it's going to take
a long time before the understanding of

and and then and the expectations you

1524
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:11,120
and and then and the expectations you
 

1525
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,670
and and then and the expectations you
know there are several aspects that are

00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:12,680
know there are several aspects that are
 

1527
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:19,890
know there are several aspects that are
going to be very complicated that the

cannot explain itself is a major major
 

1533
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:30,820
cannot explain itself is a major major
difficulty and and we're already seeing

00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:30,830
difficulty and and we're already seeing
 

1535
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:32,830
difficulty and and we're already seeing
that I mean this is this is really

that I mean this is this is really
 

1537
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,080
that I mean this is this is really
something that is happening so it's

00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:35,090
something that is happening so it's
 

1539
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:38,200
something that is happening so it's
happening in the judicial system so you

1540
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:38,210
happening in the judicial system so you
 

1541
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:39,839
happening in the judicial system so you
have

1542
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:39,849
have
 

1543
00:37:39,849 --> 00:37:42,150
have
you have system that are clearly better

00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:42,160
you have system that are clearly better
 

1545
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,470
you have system that are clearly better
at predicting parole violations then

1546
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:45,480
at predicting parole violations then

than judges but but they can't explain

1548
00:37:49,589 --> 00:37:49,599
than judges but but they can't explain
 

1549
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:54,239
than judges but but they can't explain
their reasoning and so people don't want

1550
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:54,249
their reasoning and so people don't want
 

1551
00:37:54,249 --> 00:37:58,349
their reasoning and so people don't want
to trust them we are seem to you in

1552
00:37:58,349 --> 00:37:58,359
to trust them we are seem to you in
 

1553
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:02,190
to trust them we are seem to you in
system one even use cues to make

1554
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:02,200
system one even use cues to make
 

1555
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:05,549
system one even use cues to make
judgments about our environment so this

1556
00:38:05,549 --> 00:38:05,559
judgments about our environment so this
 

1557
00:38:05,559 --> 00:38:08,279
judgments about our environment so this
explain ability point do you think

1558
00:38:08,279 --> 00:38:08,289
explain ability point do you think
 

1559
00:38:08,289 --> 00:38:12,559
explain ability point do you think
humans can explain stuff no but so I

1560
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:12,569
humans can explain stuff no but so I
 

1561
00:38:12,569 --> 00:38:16,950
humans can explain stuff no but so I
mean there is a very interesting aspect

1562
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:16,960
mean there is a very interesting aspect
 

1563
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,400
mean there is a very interesting aspect
of that humans think they can explain

1564
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:20,410
of that humans think they can explain
 

1565
00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:23,730
of that humans think they can explain
themselves right so when you say

1566
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:23,740
themselves right so when you say
 

1567
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:25,890
themselves right so when you say
something and I ask you why do you

1568
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:25,900
something and I ask you why do you
 

1569
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:28,920
something and I ask you why do you
believe that then reasons will occur to

1570
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:28,930
believe that then reasons will occur to
 

1571
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:32,249
believe that then reasons will occur to
you and you were but actually my own

1572
00:38:32,249 --> 00:38:32,259
you and you were but actually my own
 

1573
00:38:32,259 --> 00:38:35,489
you and you were but actually my own
belief is that in most cases the reasons

1574
00:38:35,489 --> 00:38:35,499
belief is that in most cases the reasons
 

1575
00:38:35,499 --> 00:38:37,019
belief is that in most cases the reasons
are very little to do with why you

1576
00:38:37,019 --> 00:38:37,029
are very little to do with why you
 

1577
00:38:37,029 --> 00:38:39,450
are very little to do with why you
believe what you believe so that the

1578
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:39,460
believe what you believe so that the
 

1579
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:42,390
believe what you believe so that the
reasons are a story that that comes to

1580
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:42,400
reasons are a story that that comes to
 

1581
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,099
reasons are a story that that comes to
your mind when you need to explain

interaction depends on those shared

1590
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:54,009
interaction depends on those shared
 

1591
00:38:54,009 --> 00:38:56,910
interaction depends on those shared
fictions and and the stories that people

1592
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:56,920
fictions and and the stories that people
 

1593
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,160
fictions and and the stories that people
tell themselves you just made me

1594
00:38:59,160 --> 00:38:59,170
tell themselves you just made me
 

1595

actually realize and we'll talk about

1596
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:01,210
actually realize and we'll talk about
 

1597
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:06,150
actually realize and we'll talk about
stories in a second that not to be

1598
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:06,160
stories in a second that not to be
 

1599
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,519
stories in a second that not to be
cynical about it but perhaps there's a

1600
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:08,529
cynical about it but perhaps there's a
 

1601
00:39:08,529 --> 00:39:10,859
cynical about it but perhaps there's a
whole movement of people trying to do

1602
00:39:10,859 --> 00:39:10,869
whole movement of people trying to do
 

1603
00:39:10,869 --> 00:39:15,210
whole movement of people trying to do
explainable AI and really we don't

1604
00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:15,220
explainable AI and really we don't
 

1605
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:17,549
explainable AI and really we don't
necessarily need to explain hey I just

1606
00:39:17,549 --> 00:39:17,559
necessarily need to explain hey I just
 

1607
00:39:17,559 --> 00:39:19,979
necessarily need to explain hey I just
need to explain itself it just needs to

1608
00:39:19,979 --> 00:39:19,989
need to explain itself it just needs to
 

1609
00:39:19,989 --> 00:39:23,910
need to explain itself it just needs to
tell a convincing story yeah it doesn't

1610
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:23,920
tell a convincing story yeah it doesn't
 

1611
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,160
tell a convincing story yeah it doesn't
missus the story doesn't necessarily

00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:26,170
missus the story doesn't necessarily
 

1613
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:29,700
missus the story doesn't necessarily
need to reflect the truth is it just

1614
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:29,710
need to reflect the truth is it just
 

1615
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:32,069
need to reflect the truth is it just
needs to be convincing there's something

1616
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:32,079
needs to be convincing there's something
 

1617
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:35,009
needs to be convincing there's something
you can say exactly the same thing in a

1618
00:39:35,009 --> 00:39:35,019
you can say exactly the same thing in a
 

1619
00:39:35,019 --> 00:39:38,160
you can say exactly the same thing in a
way that's sound cynical abysm sounds in

1620
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:38,170
way that's sound cynical abysm sounds in
 

1621
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:42,029
way that's sound cynical abysm sounds in
a grave and so but but the objective

1622
00:39:42,029 --> 00:39:42,039
a grave and so but but the objective
 

1623
00:39:42,039 --> 00:39:45,870
a grave and so but but the objective
brilliant of having an explanation is is

1624
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:45,880
brilliant of having an explanation is is
 

1625
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,970
brilliant of having an explanation is is
to tell a story that would be acceptable

1626
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:47,980
to tell a story that would be acceptable
 

1627
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:50,819
to tell a story that would be acceptable
to people and and

1628
00:39:50,819 --> 00:39:50,829
to people and and
 

1629
00:39:50,829 --> 00:39:53,400
to people and and
and for it to be acceptable and to be a

1630
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:53,410
and for it to be acceptable and to be a
 

1631
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:56,640
and for it to be acceptable and to be a
robustly acceptable it has to have some

1632
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:56,650
robustly acceptable it has to have some
 

1633
00:39:56,650 --> 00:40:02,160
robustly acceptable it has to have some
elements of truth but but the objective

1634
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:02,170
elements of truth but but the objective
 

1635
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:05,699
elements of truth but but the objective
is for people to accept it it's quite

1636
00:40:05,699 --> 00:40:05,709
is for people to accept it it's quite
 

1637
00:40:05,709 --> 00:40:09,449
is for people to accept it it's quite
brilliant actually but so on the and the

1638
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:09,459
brilliant actually but so on the and the
 

1639
00:40:09,459 --> 00:40:12,299
brilliant actually but so on the and the
stories that we tell sorry to ask me to

1640
00:40:12,299 --> 00:40:12,309
stories that we tell sorry to ask me to
 

1641
00:40:12,309 --> 00:40:14,640
stories that we tell sorry to ask me to
ask you the question that most people

1642
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:14,650
ask you the question that most people
 

1643
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:17,400
ask you the question that most people
know the answer to but you talk about

1644
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:17,410
know the answer to but you talk about
 

1645
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:20,669
know the answer to but you talk about
two cells in terms of how life has lived

1646
00:40:20,669 --> 00:40:20,679
two cells in terms of how life has lived
 

1647
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:23,849
two cells in terms of how life has lived
the experience self and remembering self

1648
00:40:23,849 --> 00:40:23,859
the experience self and remembering self
 

1649
00:40:23,859 --> 00:40:26,189
the experience self and remembering self
and you describe the distinction between

1650
00:40:26,189 --> 00:40:26,199
and you describe the distinction between
 

1651
00:40:26,199 --> 00:40:29,189
and you describe the distinction between
the two well sure I mean the there is an

1652
00:40:29,189 --> 00:40:29,199
the two well sure I mean the there is an
 

1653
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:33,239
the two well sure I mean the there is an
aspect of of life that occasionally you

1654
00:40:33,239 --> 00:40:33,249
aspect of of life that occasionally you
 

1655
00:40:33,249 --> 00:40:35,160
aspect of of life that occasionally you
know most of the time we just live and

1656
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:35,170
know most of the time we just live and
 

1657
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:37,679
know most of the time we just live and
web experiences and they're better and

1658
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:37,689
web experiences and they're better and
 

1659
00:40:37,689 --> 00:40:39,509
web experiences and they're better and
they are worse and it goes on over time

1660
00:40:39,509 --> 00:40:39,519
they are worse and it goes on over time
 

1661
00:40:39,519 --> 00:40:43,259
they are worse and it goes on over time
and mostly we forget everything happens

1662
00:40:43,259 --> 00:40:43,269
and mostly we forget everything happens
 

1663
00:40:43,269 --> 00:40:45,779
and mostly we forget everything happens
we forget most of what happens then

1664
00:40:45,779 --> 00:40:45,789
we forget most of what happens then
 

1665
00:40:45,789 --> 00:40:51,390
we forget most of what happens then
occasionally you when something ends or

1666
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:51,400
occasionally you when something ends or
 

1667
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:56,039
occasionally you when something ends or
different points you evaluate the past

1668
00:40:56,039 --> 00:40:56,049
different points you evaluate the past
 

1669
00:40:56,049 --> 00:40:58,410
different points you evaluate the past
and you form a memory and the memory is

1670
00:40:58,410 --> 00:40:58,420
and you form a memory and the memory is
 

1671
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:01,380
and you form a memory and the memory is
schematic it's not that you can roll a

1672
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:01,390
schematic it's not that you can roll a
 

1673
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:05,160
schematic it's not that you can roll a
film of an interaction you construct in

1674
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:05,170
film of an interaction you construct in
 

1675
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:07,699
film of an interaction you construct in
effect the elements of a story about it

1676
00:41:07,699 --> 00:41:07,709
effect the elements of a story about it
 

1677
00:41:07,709 --> 00:41:13,319
effect the elements of a story about it
about an episode so there is the

1678
00:41:13,319 --> 00:41:13,329
about an episode so there is the
 

1679
00:41:13,329 --> 00:41:15,660
about an episode so there is the
experience and there is a story that is

1680
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:15,670
experience and there is a story that is
 

1681
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:18,239
experience and there is a story that is
created about the experience and that's

1682
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:18,249
created about the experience and that's
 

1683
00:41:18,249 --> 00:41:21,660
created about the experience and that's
what I call the remember II so I had the

1684
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:21,670
what I call the remember II so I had the
 

1685
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:24,150
what I call the remember II so I had the
image of two selves so there is a self

1686
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:24,160
image of two selves so there is a self
 

1687
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,279
image of two selves so there is a self
that lives and there is a self that

1688
00:41:26,279 --> 00:41:26,289
that lives and there is a self that
 

1689
00:41:26,289 --> 00:41:30,630
that lives and there is a self that
evaluates life now the paradox and the

1690
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:30,640
evaluates life now the paradox and the
 

1691
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:35,339
evaluates life now the paradox and the
deep paradox in that is that we have one

1692
00:41:35,339 --> 00:41:35,349
deep paradox in that is that we have one
 

1693
00:41:35,349 --> 00:41:37,699
deep paradox in that is that we have one
system or one self that does the living

1694
00:41:37,699 --> 00:41:37,709
system or one self that does the living
 

1695
00:41:37,709 --> 00:41:42,029
system or one self that does the living
but the other system the remembering

1696
00:41:42,029 --> 00:41:42,039
but the other system the remembering
 

1697
00:41:42,039 --> 00:41:46,160
but the other system the remembering
self is all we get to keep and basically

1698
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:46,170
self is all we get to keep and basically
 

1699
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:49,410
self is all we get to keep and basically
decision-making and and everything that

1700
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:49,420
decision-making and and everything that
 

1701
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:52,349
decision-making and and everything that
we do is governed by our memories not by

1702
00:41:52,349 --> 00:41:52,359
we do is governed by our memories not by
 

1703
00:41:52,359 --> 00:41:54,509
we do is governed by our memories not by
what actually happened it's it's

1704
00:41:54,509 --> 00:41:54,519
what actually happened it's it's
 

1705
00:41:54,519 --> 00:41:57,419
what actually happened it's it's
governed by by the story that we told

1706
00:41:57,419 --> 00:41:57,429
governed by by the story that we told
 

1707
00:41:57,429 --> 00:41:59,609
governed by by the story that we told
ourselves or by the story that we're

1708
00:41:59,609 --> 00:41:59,619
ourselves or by the story that we're
 

1709
00:41:59,619 --> 00:42:03,390
ourselves or by the story that we're
keeping so that that's the distinction I

1710
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:03,400
keeping so that that's the distinction I
 

1711
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,980
keeping so that that's the distinction I
mean there's a lot of

1712
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:04,990
mean there's a lot of
 

1713
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:06,990
mean there's a lot of
ideas about the pursuit of happiness

1714
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:07,000
ideas about the pursuit of happiness
 

1715
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,480
ideas about the pursuit of happiness
that come out of that what are the

1716
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:09,490
that come out of that what are the
 

1717
00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:11,640
that come out of that what are the
properties of happiness which emerge

1718
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:11,650
properties of happiness which emerge
 

1719
00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:15,390
properties of happiness which emerge
from yourself there are there are

1720
00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:15,400
from yourself there are there are
 

1721
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,670
from yourself there are there are
properties of how we construct stories

1722
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:17,680
properties of how we construct stories
 

1723
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,970
properties of how we construct stories
that are really important so that I

1724
00:42:20,970 --> 00:42:20,980
that are really important so that I
 

1725
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:26,820
that are really important so that I
studied a few but but a couple are

1726
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:26,830
studied a few but but a couple are
 

1727
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:29,880
studied a few but but a couple are
really very striking and one is that in

1728
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:29,890
really very striking and one is that in
 

1729
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:34,079
really very striking and one is that in
stories time doesn't matter there's a

1730
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:34,089
stories time doesn't matter there's a
 

1731
00:42:34,089 --> 00:42:35,930
stories time doesn't matter there's a
sequence of events so there are

1732
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:35,940
sequence of events so there are
 

1733
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:40,589
sequence of events so there are
highlight those not and and how long it

1734
00:42:40,589 --> 00:42:40,599
highlight those not and and how long it
 

1735
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:43,079
highlight those not and and how long it
took you know they lived happily ever

1736

took you know they lived happily ever
 

1737
00:42:43,089 --> 00:42:43,640
took you know they lived happily ever
after

00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:43,650
after
 

1739
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:47,370
after
and three years later something it time

1740
00:42:47,370 --> 00:42:47,380
and three years later something it time
 

1741
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:50,820
and three years later something it time
really doesn't matter and in stories

1742
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:50,830
really doesn't matter and in stories
 

1743
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:57,150
really doesn't matter and in stories
events matter but time doesn't that that

1744
00:42:57,150 --> 00:42:57,160
events matter but time doesn't that that
 

1745
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,520
events matter but time doesn't that that
leads to a very interesting set of

1746
00:42:59,520 --> 00:42:59,530
leads to a very interesting set of
 

1747
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:03,870
leads to a very interesting set of
problems because time is all we got to

1748
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:03,880
problems because time is all we got to
 

1749
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:05,970
problems because time is all we got to
live I mean you know time is the

1750
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:05,980
live I mean you know time is the
 

1751
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:09,270
live I mean you know time is the
currency of life and yet time is not

1752
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:09,280
currency of life and yet time is not
 

1753
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:12,450
currency of life and yet time is not
represented basically in evaluative

1754
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:12,460
represented basically in evaluative
 

1755
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:16,310
represented basically in evaluative
memories so that that creates a lot of

1756
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:16,320
memories so that that creates a lot of
 

1757
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,660
memories so that that creates a lot of
paradoxes that I've thought about yeah

1758
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:18,670
paradoxes that I've thought about yeah
 

1759
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:21,180
paradoxes that I've thought about yeah
they're fascinating but if you were to

1760
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:21,190
they're fascinating but if you were to
 

1761
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:22,280
they're fascinating but if you were to

1775
00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:43,620
solve that problem I couldn't I couldn't
see and in the first place it's very

1776
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:43,630
see and in the first place it's very
 

1777
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:46,800
see and in the first place it's very
clear that if you do talk in terms of

00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:46,810
clear that if you do talk in terms of

clear that if you do talk in terms of
those two selves then that what makes

1780
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:49,570
those two selves then that what makes
 

1781
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:51,450
those two selves then that what makes
the remembering self happy and what

1782
00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:51,460
the remembering self happy and what
 

1783
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:53,370
the remembering self happy and what
makes the experiencing self happy are

1784
00:43:53,370 --> 00:43:53,380
makes the experiencing self happy are
 

1785
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:56,670
makes the experiencing self happy are
different things and I I asked the

1786
00:43:56,670 --> 00:43:56,680
different things and I I asked the
 

1787
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:00,000
different things and I I asked the
question of suppose you're planning a

1788
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:00,010
question of suppose you're planning a
 

1789

question of suppose you're planning a
vacation and you're just told that at

1790
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:02,920
vacation and you're just told that at
 

1791
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:04,560
vacation and you're just told that at
the end of the vacation you'll get an

1792
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:04,570
the end of the vacation you'll get an
 

1793
00:44:04,570 --> 00:44:07,560
the end of the vacation you'll get an
amnesic drugs who remember nothing and

1794
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:07,570
amnesic drugs who remember nothing and
 

1795
00:44:07,570 --> 00:44:10,230
amnesic drugs who remember nothing and
they'll also destroy your your photos so

1796
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:10,240
they'll also destroy your your photos so
 

1797
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:13,380
they'll also destroy your your photos so
there'll be nothing would you still go

1798
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:13,390
there'll be nothing would you still go
 

1799
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:16,640
there'll be nothing would you still go
to the same vacation

1800
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:16,650
to the same vacation
 

1801
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:21,500
to the same vacation
and and it's it turns out we go to

1802
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:21,510
and and it's it turns out we go to
 

1803
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:23,660
and and it's it turns out we go to
vacations in large part to construct

1804
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:23,670
vacations in large part to construct
 

1805
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:26,660
vacations in large part to construct
memories not to have experiences but to

1806
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:26,670
memories not to have experiences but to
 

1807
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:29,450
memories not to have experiences but to
construct memories and it turns out that

1808
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:29,460
construct memories and it turns out that
 

1809
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:31,820
construct memories and it turns out that
the vacation that you would want for

1810
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:31,830
the vacation that you would want for
 

1811

the vacation that you would want for
yourself if you knew you would not

1812
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:34,050
yourself if you knew you would not
 

1813
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:36,440
yourself if you knew you would not
remember is probably not the same

1814
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:36,450
remember is probably not the same
 

1815
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:38,540

1819
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:45,320
if you will remember so I have no
solution to these problems but clearly

1820
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:45,330
solution to these problems but clearly
 

1821
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:47,480
solution to these problems but clearly
those are big issues and you've thought

1822
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:47,490
those are big issues and you've thought
 

1823
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:50,270
those are big issues and you've thought
about issues you've talked about sort of

1824
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:50,280
about issues you've talked about sort of
 

1825
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:53,060
about issues you've talked about sort of
how many minutes or hours you spend

way to think about it because that's how
 

1831
00:44:57,330 --> 00:44:59,390
way to think about it because that's how

outside the being in it but there's also
 

1835
00:45:02,370 --> 00:45:04,460
outside the being in it but there's also
a modern I don't know if you think about

this or interact with it there's a
 

1839
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:11,990
this or interact with it there's a
modern way to magnify the remembering

it changes the experience of the world
 

1927
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:20,540
it changes the experience of the world
that you seek out experiences which

1928
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:20,550
that you seek out experiences which
 

1929
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:23,720

think the psychology of that
 

1937
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:31,540
think the psychology of that
magnification has been described yet

1938
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:31,550
magnification has been described yet
 

1939
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:33,230
magnification has been described yet
because in your world

1940
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:33,240
because in your world

because in your world
the sharing then was appear there was a

1942
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:37,410
the sharing then was appear there was a
 

1943
00:47:37,410 --> 00:47:43,880
the sharing then was appear there was a
time when people read books and you

1944
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:43,890
time when people read books and you
 

1945
00:47:43,890 --> 00:47:48,080
time when people read books and you
could assume that your friends had read

1946
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:48,090
could assume that your friends had read
 

1947
00:47:48,090 --> 00:47:51,170
could assume that your friends had read
the same books that you read so there

1948
00:47:51,170 --> 00:47:51,180
the same books that you read so there
 

1949
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:54,380
the same books that you read so there
was kind of invisible sharing a year it

1950
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:54,390
was kind of invisible sharing a year it
 

1951
00:47:54,390 --> 00:47:57,230
was kind of invisible sharing a year it
was a lot of sharing going on and there

1952
00:47:57,230 --> 00:47:57,240
was a lot of sharing going on and there
 

1953
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,270
was a lot of sharing going on and there
was a lot of assumed common knowledge

1954
00:47:59,270 --> 00:47:59,280
was a lot of assumed common knowledge
 

1955
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:03,020
was a lot of assumed common knowledge
and you know that was built in I mean it

1956
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:03,030
and you know that was built in I mean it
 

1957
00:48:03,030 --> 00:48:04,760
and you know that was built in I mean it
was obvious that you had read the New

1958
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:04,770
was obvious that you had read the New
 

1959
00:48:04,770 --> 00:48:06,590
was obvious that you had read the New
York Times it was obvious that you'd

1960
00:48:06,590 --> 00:48:06,600
York Times it was obvious that you'd
 

1961
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:10,730
York Times it was obvious that you'd
read the reviews I mean so a lot was

1962
00:48:10,730 --> 00:48:10,740
read the reviews I mean so a lot was
 

1963
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:13,480
read the reviews I mean so a lot was
taken for granted that was shared

1964
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:13,490
taken for granted that was shared
 

1965
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:17,109
taken for granted that was shared
and you know when they were when there

1966
00:48:17,109 --> 00:48:17,119
and you know when they were when there
 

1967
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:19,660
and you know when they were when there
were three television channels it was

1968
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:19,670
were three television channels it was
 

1969
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:22,030
were three television channels it was
obvious that you'd seen one of them

1970
00:48:22,030 --> 00:48:22,040
obvious that you'd seen one of them
 

1971
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:27,490
obvious that you'd seen one of them
probably the same so sharing sharing

1972
00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:27,500
probably the same so sharing sharing
 

1973
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:29,920
probably the same so sharing sharing
he's always been always was always there

it was just different at the risk of
 

1977
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:36,760
it was just different at the risk of

Camus and existentialist philosophers
 

1983
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:46,930
Camus and existentialist philosophers
and I'm joking of course about mockery

1984
00:48:46,930 --> 00:48:46,940
and I'm joking of course about mockery
 

1985
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:49,839
and I'm joking of course about mockery
but from the perspective of the two

1986
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:49,849
but from the perspective of the two
 

1987
00:48:49,849 --> 00:48:52,680
but from the perspective of the two
selves what do you think of the

1988
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:52,690
selves what do you think of the

existentialist philosophy of life so
 

1991
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:57,510
existentialist philosophy of life so
trying to really emphasize the

00:48:57,510 --> 00:48:57,520
trying to really emphasize the
 

1993
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:02,609
trying to really emphasize the
experiencing self as the proper way to

1994
00:49:02,609 --> 00:49:02,619
experiencing self as the proper way to
 

1995
00:49:02,619 --> 00:49:06,280
experiencing self as the proper way to
or the best way to live life I don't

or the best way to live life I don't
 

1997
00:49:06,290 --> 00:49:08,859
or the best way to live life I don't
know enough philosophy to and so that

1998
00:49:08,859 --> 00:49:08,869
know enough philosophy to and so that
 

1999
00:49:08,869 --> 00:49:13,060
know enough philosophy to and so that
but it's not a you know the emphasis on

00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:13,070
but it's not a you know the emphasis on
 

2001
00:49:13,070 --> 00:49:15,970
but it's not a you know the emphasis on
an experience is also the emphasis in

2002
00:49:15,970 --> 00:49:15,980
an experience is also the emphasis in
 

2003
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:20,530
an experience is also the emphasis in
Buddhism right it's so that you just

2004
00:49:20,530 --> 00:49:20,540
Buddhism right it's so that you just
 

2005
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:24,130
Buddhism right it's so that you just
have got to to experience things and and

2006
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:24,140
have got to to experience things and and
 

2007
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:27,760
have got to to experience things and and
and not to evaluate and not to pass

2008
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:27,770
and not to evaluate and not to pass
 

2009
00:49:27,770 --> 00:49:31,000
and not to evaluate and not to pass
judgment and not to score not to keep

2010
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:31,010
judgment and not to score not to keep
 

2011
00:49:31,010 --> 00:49:35,349
judgment and not to score not to keep
score so if when you look at the the

2012
00:49:35,349 --> 00:49:35,359
score so if when you look at the the
 

2013
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:37,120
score so if when you look at the the
grand picture of experience you think

2014
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:37,130
grand picture of experience you think
 

2015
00:49:37,130 --> 00:49:40,390
grand picture of experience you think
there's something to that that one one

2016
00:49:40,390 --> 00:49:40,400
there's something to that that one one
 

2017
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,310
there's something to that that one one
of the ways to achieve contentment and

2018
00:49:42,310 --> 00:49:42,320
of the ways to achieve contentment and
 

2019
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:45,660
of the ways to achieve contentment and
maybe even happiness is letting go of

2020
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:45,670
maybe even happiness is letting go of
 

2021
00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:50,079
maybe even happiness is letting go of
any of the things any of the procedures

2022
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:50,089
any of the things any of the procedures
 

2023
00:49:50,089 --> 00:49:53,950
any of the things any of the procedures
of the remembering self well yeah I mean

2024
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:53,960
of the remembering self well yeah I mean
 

2025
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:56,020
of the remembering self well yeah I mean
I think you know if one could imagine a

2026
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:56,030
I think you know if one could imagine a
 

2027
00:49:56,030 --> 00:49:58,480
I think you know if one could imagine a
life in which people don't score

2028
00:49:58,480 --> 00:49:58,490
life in which people don't score
 

2029
00:49:58,490 --> 00:50:02,800
life in which people don't score
themselves it it feels as if that would

2030
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:02,810
themselves it it feels as if that would
 

2031
00:50:02,810 --> 00:50:05,980
themselves it it feels as if that would
be a better life as if the self scoring

2032
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:05,990
be a better life as if the self scoring
 

2033
00:50:05,990 --> 00:50:09,460
be a better life as if the self scoring
and you know how am i doing a kind of

2034
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:09,470
and you know how am i doing a kind of
 

2035
00:50:09,470 --> 00:50:15,940
and you know how am i doing a kind of
question is not is not a very happy

2036
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:15,950
question is not is not a very happy
 

2037
00:50:15,950 --> 00:50:19,930
question is not is not a very happy
thing to have but I got out of that

2038
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:19,940
thing to have but I got out of that
 

2039
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:23,650
thing to have but I got out of that
field because I couldn't solve that and

2040
00:50:23,650 --> 00:50:23,660
field because I couldn't solve that and
 

2041
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:26,860
field because I couldn't solve that and
and that was because my intuition was

2042
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:26,870
and that was because my intuition was
 

2043
00:50:26,870 --> 00:50:29,440
and that was because my intuition was
that the experiencing self that's

2044
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:29,450
that the experiencing self that's
 

2045
00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:33,100
that the experiencing self that's
reality but then it turns out that what

2046
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:33,110
reality but then it turns out that what
 

2047
00:50:33,110 --> 00:50:34,870
reality but then it turns out that what
people want for themselves

2048
00:50:34,870 --> 00:50:34,880
people want for themselves
 

2049
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,340
people want for themselves
there's not experience that they want

2050
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:36,350
there's not experience that they want
 

2051
00:50:36,350 --> 00:50:38,230
there's not experience that they want
memories and they want a good story

2052
00:50:38,230 --> 00:50:38,240
memories and they want a good story
 

2053
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,930
memories and they want a good story
about their life and so you cannot have

2054
00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:40,940
about their life and so you cannot have
 

2055
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:42,970
about their life and so you cannot have
a theory of happiness that doesn't

2056
00:50:42,970 --> 00:50:42,980
a theory of happiness that doesn't
 

2057
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:44,950
a theory of happiness that doesn't
correspond to what people want for

2058
00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:44,960
correspond to what people want for
 

2059
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:48,520
correspond to what people want for
themselves and when I when I realized

2060
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:48,530
themselves and when I when I realized
 

2061
00:50:48,530 --> 00:50:50,590
themselves and when I when I realized
that this this was where things were

2062
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:50,600
that this this was where things were
 

2063
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:53,890
that this this was where things were
going I really sort of left the field of

research do you think there's something

2066
00:50:56,050 --> 00:50:56,060
research do you think there's something
 

2067
00:50:56,060 --> 00:50:58,900
research do you think there's something

instructive about this emphasis of

there's some pattern formation like

he is he's a survivor yeah and you know

2146
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:57,410
he is he's a survivor yeah and you know
 

2147
00:52:57,410 --> 00:53:01,359
he is he's a survivor yeah and you know
he survived with that and I'm and I'm

he survived with that and I'm and I'm
 

2149
00:53:01,369 --> 00:53:04,120
he survived with that and I'm and I'm
not sure how I central to survival the

2150
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:04,130
not sure how I central to survival the
 

2151
00:53:04,130 --> 00:53:07,810
not sure how I central to survival the
same years yeah I do know when I think

2152
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:07,820
same years yeah I do know when I think
 

2153
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:10,109
same years yeah I do know when I think
about myself that I would have given up

2154
00:53:10,109 --> 00:53:10,119
about myself that I would have given up
 

2155
00:53:10,119 --> 00:53:14,349
about myself that I would have given up
at oh yeah this isn't going anywhere and

2156
00:53:14,349 --> 00:53:14,359
at oh yeah this isn't going anywhere and
 

2157
00:53:14,359 --> 00:53:17,260
at oh yeah this isn't going anywhere and
there is there is a sort of character

2158
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:17,270
there is there is a sort of character
 

2159
00:53:17,270 --> 00:53:21,130
there is there is a sort of character
that that that manages to survive in

2160
00:53:21,130 --> 00:53:21,140
that that that manages to survive in
 

2161
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:24,099
that that that manages to survive in
conditions like that and then because

2162
00:53:24,099 --> 00:53:24,109
conditions like that and then because
 

2163
00:53:24,109 --> 00:53:26,260
conditions like that and then because
they survive they tell stories and it

2164
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:26,270
they survive they tell stories and it
 

2165
00:53:26,270 --> 00:53:28,660
they survive they tell stories and it
sounds as if they survived because of

2166
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:28,670
sounds as if they survived because of
 

2167
00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:30,640
sounds as if they survived because of
what they were doing we have no idea

2168
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:30,650
what they were doing we have no idea
 

2169
00:53:30,650 --> 00:53:33,250
what they were doing we have no idea
they survived because the kind of people

2170
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:33,260
they survived because the kind of people
 

2171
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:35,140
they survived because the kind of people
that they are and the other kind of

2172
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:35,150
that they are and the other kind of
 

2173
00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:36,970
that they are and the other kind of
people survives them to tell them such

2174
00:53:36,970 --> 00:53:36,980
people survives them to tell them such
 

2175
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:40,859
people survives them to tell them such
stories of a particular guy so I'm not

2176
00:53:40,859 --> 00:53:40,869
stories of a particular guy so I'm not
 

2177
00:53:40,869 --> 00:53:43,930
stories of a particular guy so I'm not
so that you don't think seeking purpose

2178
00:53:43,930 --> 00:53:43,940
so that you don't think seeking purpose
 

2179
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:46,329
so that you don't think seeking purpose
is a significant driver and are the

2180
00:53:46,329 --> 00:53:46,339
is a significant driver and are the
 

2181
00:53:46,339 --> 00:53:50,020
is a significant driver and are the
units it's a very interesting question

2182
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:50,030
units it's a very interesting question
 

2183
00:53:50,030 --> 00:53:52,720
units it's a very interesting question
because when you ask people whether it's

2184
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:52,730
because when you ask people whether it's
 

2185
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:54,160
because when you ask people whether it's
very important to add meaning in their

2186
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:54,170
very important to add meaning in their
 

2187
00:53:54,170 --> 00:53:55,750
very important to add meaning in their
life that's oh yes that's the most

2188
00:53:55,750 --> 00:53:55,760
life that's oh yes that's the most
 

2189
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:58,570
life that's oh yes that's the most
important thing but when you ask people

2190
00:53:58,570 --> 00:53:58,580
important thing but when you ask people
 

2191
00:53:58,580 --> 00:54:02,280
important thing but when you ask people
what kind of a day did you have and and

00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:08,040
you know what were the experiences that
you remember you don't get much meaning

2196
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:08,050
you remember you don't get much meaning
 

2197
00:54:08,050 --> 00:54:14,760
you remember you don't get much meaning
you get social experiences then and and

00:54:22,839 --> 00:54:22,849
in child you know in taking care of
 

2203
00:54:22,849 --> 00:54:24,579
in child you know in taking care of
children the fact that they're your

2204
00:54:24,579 --> 00:54:24,589
children the fact that they're your
 

2205
00:54:24,589 --> 00:54:27,210
children the fact that they're your
children and you're taking care of them

2206
00:54:27,210 --> 00:54:27,220
children and you're taking care of them
 

2207
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:30,790
children and you're taking care of them
makes a very big difference I think

2208
00:54:30,790 --> 00:54:30,800
makes a very big difference I think
 

2209
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:34,450
makes a very big difference I think
that's entirely true but it's more

2210
00:54:34,450 --> 00:54:34,460
that's entirely true but it's more
 

2211
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:38,050
that's entirely true but it's more
because the story that we are telling

2212
00:54:38,050 --> 00:54:38,060
because the story that we are telling
 

2213
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:40,180
because the story that we are telling
ourselves which is a very different

2214
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:40,190
ourselves which is a very different
 

2215
00:54:40,190 --> 00:54:41,890
ourselves which is a very different
story when we're taking care of our

2216
00:54:41,890 --> 00:54:41,900
story when we're taking care of our
 

2217
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:43,690
story when we're taking care of our
children or when we're taking here other

2218
00:54:43,690 --> 00:54:43,700
children or when we're taking here other
 

2219
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:46,690
children or when we're taking here other
thing jumping around a little bit in

2220
00:54:46,690 --> 00:54:46,700
thing jumping around a little bit in
 

2221
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,820
thing jumping around a little bit in
doing a lot of experiments let me ask a

2222
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:48,830
doing a lot of experiments let me ask a
 

2223
00:54:48,830 --> 00:54:49,940
doing a lot of experiments let me ask a
question

2224
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:49,950
question
 

2225
00:54:49,950 --> 00:54:52,309
question
most of the work I do for example is in

2226
00:54:52,309 --> 00:54:52,319
most of the work I do for example is in
 

2227
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:55,789
most of the work I do for example is in
the wall in the real world but most of

2228
00:54:55,789 --> 00:54:55,799
the wall in the real world but most of
 

2229
00:54:55,799 --> 00:54:58,250
the wall in the real world but most of
the clean good-sized that you can do is

2230
00:54:58,250 --> 00:54:58,260
the clean good-sized that you can do is
 

2231
00:54:58,260 --> 00:55:02,960
the clean good-sized that you can do is
in the lab so that distinction do you

2232
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:02,970
in the lab so that distinction do you
 

2233
00:55:02,970 --> 00:55:05,210
in the lab so that distinction do you
think we can understand the fundamentals

2234
00:55:05,210 --> 00:55:05,220
think we can understand the fundamentals
 

2235
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:08,750
think we can understand the fundamentals
of human behavior through controlled

2236
00:55:08,750 --> 00:55:08,760
of human behavior through controlled
 

2237
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:12,829
of human behavior through controlled
experiments in the lab if we talk about

2238
00:55:12,829 --> 00:55:12,839
experiments in the lab if we talk about
 

2239
00:55:12,839 --> 00:55:15,710
experiments in the lab if we talk about
pupil diameter for example it's much

2240
00:55:15,710 --> 00:55:15,720
pupil diameter for example it's much
 

2241
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:18,620
pupil diameter for example it's much
easier to do when you can control

2242
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:18,630
easier to do when you can control
 

2243
00:55:18,630 --> 00:55:20,890
easier to do when you can control
lighting conditions yeah thanks

2244
00:55:20,890 --> 00:55:20,900
lighting conditions yeah thanks
 

2245
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:24,799
lighting conditions yeah thanks
so when we look at driving lighting

2246
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:24,809
so when we look at driving lighting
 

2247
00:55:24,809 --> 00:55:27,890
so when we look at driving lighting
variation destroys yeah absolutely your

2248
00:55:27,890 --> 00:55:27,900
variation destroys yeah absolutely your
 

2249
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:31,970
variation destroys yeah absolutely your
ability to use pupil diameter but in the

2250
00:55:31,970 --> 00:55:31,980
ability to use pupil diameter but in the
 

2251
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:34,430
ability to use pupil diameter but in the
lab for as I mentioned semi autonomous

2252
00:55:34,430 --> 00:55:34,440
lab for as I mentioned semi autonomous
 

2253
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:36,920
lab for as I mentioned semi autonomous
autonomous vehicles in driving

2254
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:36,930
autonomous vehicles in driving
 

2255
00:55:36,930 --> 00:55:40,250
autonomous vehicles in driving
simulators we can't we don't capture

2256
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:40,260
simulators we can't we don't capture
 

2257
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:44,000
simulators we can't we don't capture
true honest human behavior in that

2258
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:44,010
true honest human behavior in that
 

2259
00:55:44,010 --> 00:55:47,720
true honest human behavior in that
particular domain so your what's your

2260
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:47,730
particular domain so your what's your
 

2261
00:55:47,730 --> 00:55:49,520
particular domain so your what's your
intuition how much of human behavior can

2262
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:49,530
intuition how much of human behavior can
 

2263
00:55:49,530 --> 00:55:52,250
intuition how much of human behavior can
we study in this controlled environment

2264
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:52,260
we study in this controlled environment
 

2265
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:55,670
we study in this controlled environment
of the lab a lot but you'd have to

2266
00:55:55,670 --> 00:55:55,680
of the lab a lot but you'd have to
 

2267
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:58,039
of the lab a lot but you'd have to
verify it you know that you'll your

2268
00:55:58,039 --> 00:55:58,049
verify it you know that you'll your
 

2269
00:55:58,049 --> 00:56:01,819
verify it you know that you'll your
conclusions are basically limited to the

2270
00:56:01,819 --> 00:56:01,829
conclusions are basically limited to the
 

2271
00:56:01,829 --> 00:56:04,760
conclusions are basically limited to the
situation to the experimental situation

2272
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:04,770
situation to the experimental situation
 

2273
00:56:04,770 --> 00:56:08,059
situation to the experimental situation
then you have to jump the big inductive

2274
00:56:08,059 --> 00:56:08,069
then you have to jump the big inductive
 

2275
00:56:08,069 --> 00:56:12,980
then you have to jump the big inductive
leap to the real world so and and that's

2276
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:12,990
leap to the real world so and and that's
 

2277
00:56:12,990 --> 00:56:16,280
leap to the real world so and and that's
the Flair that's where the difference I

2278
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:16,290
the Flair that's where the difference I
 

2279
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:20,240
the Flair that's where the difference I
think between the good psychologist and

2280
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:20,250
think between the good psychologist and
 

2281
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:23,960
think between the good psychologist and
others of the mediocre is in the sense

2282
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:23,970
others of the mediocre is in the sense
 

2283
00:56:23,970 --> 00:56:26,390
others of the mediocre is in the sense
of that your experiment captures

2284
00:56:26,390 --> 00:56:26,400
of that your experiment captures
 

2285
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:29,539
of that your experiment captures
something that's important and something

2286
00:56:29,539 --> 00:56:29,549
something that's important and something
 

2287
00:56:29,549 --> 00:56:32,180
something that's important and something
that's real and others are just running

2288
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:32,190
that's real and others are just running
 

2289
00:56:32,190 --> 00:56:34,760
that's real and others are just running
experiments so what is that like the

2290
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:34,770
experiments so what is that like the
 

2291
00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:37,579
experiments so what is that like the
birth of an idea to his development in

2292
00:56:37,579 --> 00:56:37,589
birth of an idea to his development in
 

2293
00:56:37,589 --> 00:56:39,530
birth of an idea to his development in
your mind to something that leads to an

2294
00:56:39,530 --> 00:56:39,540
your mind to something that leads to an
 

2295
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:42,980
your mind to something that leads to an
experiment is that similar to maybe like

2296
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:42,990
experiment is that similar to maybe like
 

2297
00:56:42,990 --> 00:56:45,170
experiment is that similar to maybe like
what I Steiner good physicists do is

2298
00:56:45,170 --> 00:56:45,180
what I Steiner good physicists do is
 

2299
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:47,720
what I Steiner good physicists do is
your intuition you basically use your

2300
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:47,730
your intuition you basically use your
 

2301
00:56:47,730 --> 00:56:50,240
your intuition you basically use your
intuition to build up but I mean you

2302
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:50,250
intuition to build up but I mean you
 

2303
00:56:50,250 --> 00:56:52,700
intuition to build up but I mean you
know it's it's very skilled intuition

2304
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:52,710
know it's it's very skilled intuition
 

2305
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:54,770
know it's it's very skilled intuition
right I mean I just had that experience

2306
00:56:54,770 --> 00:56:54,780
right I mean I just had that experience
 

2307
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:57,680
right I mean I just had that experience
actually I had an idea that's turned out

2308
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:57,690
actually I had an idea that's turned out
 

2309
00:56:57,690 --> 00:56:59,370
actually I had an idea that's turned out
to be very good idea

2310
00:56:59,370 --> 00:56:59,380
to be very good idea
 

2311
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:04,109
to be very good idea
a couple of days ago and and you and you

2312
00:57:04,109 --> 00:57:04,119
a couple of days ago and and you and you
 

2313
00:57:04,119 --> 00:57:06,390
a couple of days ago and and you and you
have a sense of that building up so I'm

2314
00:57:06,390 --> 00:57:06,400
have a sense of that building up so I'm
 

2315
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:09,299
have a sense of that building up so I'm
working with a collaborator and he

2316
00:57:09,299 --> 00:57:09,309
working with a collaborator and he
 

2317
00:57:09,309 --> 00:57:10,710
working with a collaborator and he
essentially was saying you know what

2318
00:57:10,710 --> 00:57:10,720
essentially was saying you know what
 

2319
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:13,529
essentially was saying you know what
what are you doing what's what's going

2320
00:57:13,529 --> 00:57:13,539
what are you doing what's what's going
 

2321
00:57:13,539 --> 00:57:17,309
what are you doing what's what's going
on and I was I really I couldn't exactly

2322
00:57:17,309 --> 00:57:17,319
on and I was I really I couldn't exactly
 

2323
00:57:17,319 --> 00:57:19,740
on and I was I really I couldn't exactly
explain it but I knew this is going

2324
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:19,750
explain it but I knew this is going
 

2325
00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:22,049
explain it but I knew this is going
somewhere but you know I've been around

2326
00:57:22,049 --> 00:57:22,059
somewhere but you know I've been around
 

2327
00:57:22,059 --> 00:57:24,569
somewhere but you know I've been around
that game for a very long time and so I

2328
00:57:24,569 --> 00:57:24,579
that game for a very long time and so I
 

2329
00:57:24,579 --> 00:57:27,960
that game for a very long time and so I
can you you develop that anticipation

2330
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:27,970
can you you develop that anticipation
 

2331
00:57:27,970 --> 00:57:31,230
can you you develop that anticipation
that yes this this is worth following

2332
00:57:31,230 --> 00:57:31,240
that yes this this is worth following
 

2333
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:33,569
that yes this this is worth following
now that he's here that's part of the

2334
00:57:33,569 --> 00:57:33,579
now that he's here that's part of the
 

2335
00:57:33,579 --> 00:57:36,180
now that he's here that's part of the
skill is that something you can reduce

2336
00:57:36,180 --> 00:57:36,190
skill is that something you can reduce
 

2337
00:57:36,190 --> 00:57:39,660
skill is that something you can reduce
two words in describing a process in in

00:57:44,249 --> 00:57:44,259
the form of advice to others know follow
 

2341
00:57:44,259 --> 00:57:46,680
the form of advice to others know follow
your heart essentially you know it's

2342
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:46,690
your heart essentially you know it's
 

2343
00:57:46,690 --> 00:57:49,410
your heart essentially you know it's
it's like trying to explain what it's

2344
00:57:49,410 --> 00:57:49,420
it's like trying to explain what it's
 

2345
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:52,079
it's like trying to explain what it's
like to drive it's not you've got to

2346
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:52,089
like to drive it's not you've got to
 

2347
00:57:52,089 --> 00:57:54,390
like to drive it's not you've got to
break it apart and it's not and then you

2348
00:57:54,390 --> 00:57:54,400
break it apart and it's not and then you
 

2349
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,430
break it apart and it's not and then you
lose and then you lose the experience

2350
00:57:56,430 --> 00:57:56,440
lose and then you lose the experience
 

2351
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:59,549
lose and then you lose the experience

years we shared the magical experience
 

2373
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:27,180
years we shared the magical experience
of one of us saying something which the

2374
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:27,190
of one of us saying something which the
 

2375
00:58:27,190 --> 00:58:28,440
of one of us saying something which the
other one would understand more deeply

old laws of information theory it was
 

2381
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:36,539
old laws of information theory it was
common for us to find that more

common for us to find that more
 

2383
00:58:36,549 --> 00:58:38,400
common for us to find that more
information was received than had been

robotics and on so and I knew that you
 

2479
01:01:02,730 --> 01:01:04,850
robotics and on so and I knew that you
were dealing with that so it was curious

2480
01:01:04,850 --> 01:01:04,860
were dealing with that so it was curious

right so what do you think is the source

2500
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:40,260
right so what do you think is the source
 

2501
01:01:40,260 --> 01:01:42,500
right so what do you think is the source
where do you think I think I know what's

where do you think I think I know what's
 

2503
01:01:42,510 --> 01:01:45,410
where do you think I think I know what's
going on actually I mean I have a theory

2504
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:45,420
going on actually I mean I have a theory
 

2505
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:48,800
going on actually I mean I have a theory
about what's going on and what's going

2506

about what's going on and what's going
 

2507
01:01:48,810 --> 01:01:53,870
about what's going on and what's going
on is that there is first of all a very

2508
01:01:53,870 --> 01:01:53,880
on is that there is first of all a very
 

2509
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:55,970
on is that there is first of all a very
important distinction between two types

2510
01:01:55,970 --> 01:01:55,980
important distinction between two types
 

2511
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:57,400
important distinction between two types
of experiments

2512
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:57,410
of experiments
 

2513
01:01:57,410 --> 01:02:00,310
of experiments
and one type is within subject so it's

2514
01:02:00,310 --> 01:02:00,320
and one type is within subject so it's
 

2515
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:04,030
and one type is within subject so it's
the same person has two experimental

2516
01:02:04,030 --> 01:02:04,040
the same person has two experimental
 

2517
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:06,940
the same person has two experimental
conditions and the other type is between

2518
01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:06,950
conditions and the other type is between
 

2519
01:02:06,950 --> 01:02:09,460
conditions and the other type is between
subjects where some people have this

2520
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:09,470
subjects where some people have this
 

2521
01:02:09,470 --> 01:02:10,780
subjects where some people have this
condition are the people in that

2522
01:02:10,780 --> 01:02:10,790
condition are the people in that
 

2523
01:02:10,790 --> 01:02:13,140
condition are the people in that
condition they're different world and

2524
01:02:13,140 --> 01:02:13,150
condition they're different world and
 

2525
01:02:13,150 --> 01:02:16,870
condition they're different world and
between subject experiments are much

2526
01:02:16,870 --> 01:02:16,880
between subject experiments are much
 

2527
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:20,980
between subject experiments are much
harder to predict and much harder to

2528
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:20,990
harder to predict and much harder to
 

2529
01:02:20,990 --> 01:02:25,750
harder to predict and much harder to
anticipate and the reason and they're

2530
01:02:25,750 --> 01:02:25,760
anticipate and the reason and they're
 

2531
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:27,670
anticipate and the reason and they're
also more expensive because you need

2532
01:02:27,670 --> 01:02:27,680
also more expensive because you need
 

2533
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:31,780
also more expensive because you need
more people and it's just so between

2534
01:02:31,780 --> 01:02:31,790
more people and it's just so between
 

2535
01:02:31,790 --> 01:02:34,030
more people and it's just so between
subject experiments is where the problem

2536
01:02:34,030 --> 01:02:34,040
subject experiments is where the problem
 

2537
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:38,020
subject experiments is where the problem
is it's not so much and within subject

2538
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:38,030
is it's not so much and within subject
 

2539
01:02:38,030 --> 01:02:39,850
is it's not so much and within subject
experiments it's really between and

2540
01:02:39,850 --> 01:02:39,860
experiments it's really between and
 

2541
01:02:39,860 --> 01:02:43,800
experiments it's really between and
there is a very good reason why the

2542
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:43,810
there is a very good reason why the
 

2543
01:02:43,810 --> 01:02:47,440
there is a very good reason why the
intuitions of researchers about between

2544
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:47,450
intuitions of researchers about between
 

2545
01:02:47,450 --> 01:02:50,890
intuitions of researchers about between
subject experiments are wrong and that's

2546
01:02:50,890 --> 01:02:50,900
subject experiments are wrong and that's
 

2547
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:54,280
subject experiments are wrong and that's
because when you are a researcher you're

2548
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:54,290
because when you are a researcher you're
 

2549
01:02:54,290 --> 01:02:57,070
because when you are a researcher you're
in a within subject situation and it is

2550
01:02:57,070 --> 01:02:57,080
in a within subject situation and it is
 

2551
01:02:57,080 --> 01:03:00,460
in a within subject situation and it is
you are imagining the two conditions and

2552
01:03:00,460 --> 01:03:00,470
you are imagining the two conditions and
 

2553
01:03:00,470 --> 01:03:03,280
you are imagining the two conditions and
you see the causality and you feel it

2554
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:03,290
you see the causality and you feel it
 

2555
01:03:03,290 --> 01:03:05,860
you see the causality and you feel it
and but in the between subjects

2556
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:05,870
and but in the between subjects
 

2557
01:03:05,870 --> 01:03:09,490
and but in the between subjects
condition they don't like they see they

2558
01:03:09,490 --> 01:03:09,500
condition they don't like they see they
 

2559
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:11,680
condition they don't like they see they
live in one condition and the other one

2560
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:11,690
live in one condition and the other one
 

2561
01:03:11,690 --> 01:03:13,210
live in one condition and the other one
is just nowhere

2562
01:03:13,210 --> 01:03:13,220
is just nowhere
 

2563
01:03:13,220 --> 01:03:18,400
is just nowhere
so our intuitions are very weak about

2564
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:18,410
so our intuitions are very weak about
 

2565
01:03:18,410 --> 01:03:21,040
so our intuitions are very weak about
between subject experiments and that I

2566
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:21,050
between subject experiments and that I
 

2567
01:03:21,050 --> 01:03:23,650
between subject experiments and that I
think is something that people haven't

2568
01:03:23,650 --> 01:03:23,660
think is something that people haven't
 

2569
01:03:23,660 --> 01:03:29,200
think is something that people haven't
realized and and in addition because of

2570
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:29,210
realized and and in addition because of
 

2571
01:03:29,210 --> 01:03:33,660
realized and and in addition because of
that we have no idea about the power of

2572
01:03:33,660 --> 01:03:33,670
that we have no idea about the power of
 

2573
01:03:33,670 --> 01:03:35,620
that we have no idea about the power of
manipulations of experimental

2574
01:03:35,620 --> 01:03:35,630
manipulations of experimental
 

2575
01:03:35,630 --> 01:03:37,300
manipulations of experimental
manipulations because the same

2576
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:37,310
manipulations because the same
 

2577
01:03:37,310 --> 01:03:40,290
manipulations because the same
manipulation it's much more powerful

2578
01:03:40,290 --> 01:03:40,300
manipulation it's much more powerful
 

2579
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:43,720
manipulation it's much more powerful
when when you are in the two conditions

2580
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:43,730
when when you are in the two conditions
 

2581
01:03:43,730 --> 01:03:46,360
when when you are in the two conditions
then when you live in only one condition

2582
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:46,370
then when you live in only one condition
 

2583
01:03:46,370 --> 01:03:49,840
then when you live in only one condition
and so the experimenters have very poor

2584
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:49,850
and so the experimenters have very poor
 

2585
01:03:49,850 --> 01:03:51,760
and so the experimenters have very poor
intuitions about between subject

2586
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:51,770
intuitions about between subject
 

2587
01:03:51,770 --> 01:03:55,780
intuitions about between subject
experiments and and there is something

2588
01:03:55,780 --> 01:03:55,790
experiments and and there is something
 

2589
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:58,330
experiments and and there is something
else which is very important I think

2590
01:03:58,330 --> 01:03:58,340
else which is very important I think
 

2591
01:03:58,340 --> 01:04:01,620
else which is very important I think
which is that almost all psychological

2592
01:04:01,620 --> 01:04:01,630
which is that almost all psychological
 

2593
01:04:01,630 --> 01:04:05,170
which is that almost all psychological
hypotheses are true that is in the sense

2594
01:04:05,170 --> 01:04:05,180
hypotheses are true that is in the sense
 

2595
01:04:05,180 --> 01:04:09,940
hypotheses are true that is in the sense
that you know directionally if you have

2596
01:04:09,940 --> 01:04:09,950
that you know directionally if you have
 

2597
01:04:09,950 --> 01:04:11,260
that you know directionally if you have
a hypothesis that

2598
01:04:11,260 --> 01:04:11,270
a hypothesis that
 

2599
01:04:11,270 --> 01:04:15,700
a hypothesis that
a really causes B that that it's not

2600
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:15,710
a really causes B that that it's not
 

2601
01:04:15,710 --> 01:04:18,160
a really causes B that that it's not
true that is causes the opposite of B

2602
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:18,170
true that is causes the opposite of B
 

2603
01:04:18,170 --> 01:04:21,300
true that is causes the opposite of B
maybe a just and very little effect but

2604
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:21,310
maybe a just and very little effect but
 

2605
01:04:21,310 --> 01:04:23,050
maybe a just and very little effect but
hypotheses are true

2606
01:04:23,050 --> 01:04:23,060
hypotheses are true
 

2607
01:04:23,060 --> 01:04:26,770
hypotheses are true
mostly except mostly they're very weak

2608
01:04:26,770 --> 01:04:26,780
mostly except mostly they're very weak
 

2609
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:30,070
mostly except mostly they're very weak
they're much weaker than you think when

2610
01:04:30,070 --> 01:04:30,080
they're much weaker than you think when
 

2611
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:35,620
they're much weaker than you think when
you are having images of so the reason

2612
01:04:35,620 --> 01:04:35,630
you are having images of so the reason
 

2613
01:04:35,630 --> 01:04:37,330
you are having images of so the reason
I'm excited about that is that I

2614
01:04:37,330 --> 01:04:37,340
I'm excited about that is that I
 

2615
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:43,660
I'm excited about that is that I
recently heard about some some friends

2616
01:04:43,660 --> 01:04:43,670
recently heard about some some friends
 

2617
01:04:43,670 --> 01:04:49,060
recently heard about some some friends
of mine who they essentially funded 53

2618
01:04:49,060 --> 01:04:49,070
of mine who they essentially funded 53
 

2619
01:04:49,070 --> 01:04:52,870

different teams of people with a very

2622
01:04:55,810 --> 01:04:55,820
different teams of people with a very
 

2623
01:04:55,820 --> 01:04:59,440
different teams of people with a very
precise objective of changing the number

2624
01:04:59,440 --> 01:04:59,450
precise objective of changing the number
 

2625
01:04:59,450 --> 01:05:01,359
precise objective of changing the number
of time that people go to the gym but

2626
01:05:01,359 --> 01:05:01,369
of time that people go to the gym but
 

2627
01:05:01,369 --> 01:05:08,170
of time that people go to the gym but
you know and and the success rate was

2628
01:05:08,170 --> 01:05:08,180
you know and and the success rate was
 

2629
01:05:08,180 --> 01:05:12,280
you know and and the success rate was
zero the knocks one of the 53 studies

zero the knocks one of the 53 studies
work now what's interesting about that

2632
01:05:14,859 --> 01:05:14,869
work now what's interesting about that
 

2633
01:05:14,869 --> 01:05:17,140
work now what's interesting about that
is those are the best people in the

2634
01:05:17,140 --> 01:05:17,150
is those are the best people in the
 

2635
01:05:17,150 --> 01:05:20,470
is those are the best people in the
field and they have no idea what's going

2636
01:05:20,470 --> 01:05:20,480
field and they have no idea what's going
 

2637
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:24,070
field and they have no idea what's going
on so they are not calibrated they think

2638
01:05:24,070 --> 01:05:24,080
on so they are not calibrated they think
 

2639
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:25,780
on so they are not calibrated they think
that it's going to be powerful because

2640
01:05:25,780 --> 01:05:25,790
that it's going to be powerful because
 

2641
01:05:25,790 --> 01:05:28,720
that it's going to be powerful because
they can imagine it but actually it's

2642
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:28,730
they can imagine it but actually it's
 

2643
01:05:28,730 --> 01:05:30,940
they can imagine it but actually it's
just weak because the and you are

2644
01:05:30,940 --> 01:05:30,950
just weak because the and you are
 

2645
01:05:30,950 --> 01:05:34,660
just weak because the and you are
focusing on on your manipulation and it

2646
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:34,670
focusing on on your manipulation and it
 

2647
01:05:34,670 --> 01:05:37,599
focusing on on your manipulation and it
feels powerful to you there's a thing

2648
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:37,609
feels powerful to you there's a thing
 

2649
01:05:37,609 --> 01:05:38,950
feels powerful to you there's a thing
that I've written about that's called

2650
01:05:38,950 --> 01:05:38,960
that I've written about that's called
 

2651
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:42,280
that I've written about that's called
the focusing illusion that is that when

2652
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:42,290
the focusing illusion that is that when
 

2653
01:05:42,290 --> 01:05:43,900
the focusing illusion that is that when
you think about something it looks very

2654
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:43,910
you think about something it looks very
 

2655
01:05:43,910 --> 01:05:47,770
you think about something it looks very
important more important than it really

2656
01:05:47,770 --> 01:05:47,780
important more important than it really
 

2657
01:05:47,780 --> 01:05:49,510
important more important than it really
is more important than it really is but

2658
01:05:49,510 --> 01:05:49,520
is more important than it really is but
 

2659
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:52,030
is more important than it really is but
if you don't see that effect the 53

2660
01:05:52,030 --> 01:05:52,040
if you don't see that effect the 53
 

2661
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:56,050
if you don't see that effect the 53
studies doesn't I mean you just report

2662
01:05:56,050 --> 01:05:56,060
studies doesn't I mean you just report
 

2663
01:05:56,060 --> 01:05:58,570
studies doesn't I mean you just report
that so what was I guess the solution to

2664
01:05:58,570 --> 01:05:58,580
that so what was I guess the solution to
 

2665
01:05:58,580 --> 01:05:58,900
that so what was I guess the solution to
that

2666
01:05:58,900 --> 01:05:58,910
that
 

2667
01:05:58,910 --> 01:06:02,980
that
well I mean the the solution is for

2668
01:06:02,980 --> 01:06:02,990
well I mean the the solution is for
 

2669
01:06:02,990 --> 01:06:05,500
well I mean the the solution is for
people to trust their intuitions less

2670
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:05,510
people to trust their intuitions less
 

2671
01:06:05,510 --> 01:06:10,090
people to trust their intuitions less
all to try out their intuitions before I

2672
01:06:10,090 --> 01:06:10,100
all to try out their intuitions before I
 

2673
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:12,720
all to try out their intuitions before I
mean experiments have to be

2674
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:12,730
mean experiments have to be
 

2675
01:06:12,730 --> 01:06:15,250
mean experiments have to be
pre-registered and by the time you run

2676
01:06:15,250 --> 01:06:15,260
pre-registered and by the time you run
 

2677
01:06:15,260 --> 01:06:17,560
pre-registered and by the time you run
an experiment you have to be committed

2678
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:17,570
an experiment you have to be committed
 

2679
01:06:17,570 --> 01:06:20,320
an experiment you have to be committed
to it and you have to run the experiment

2680
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:20,330
to it and you have to run the experiment
 

2681
01:06:20,330 --> 01:06:22,340
to it and you have to run the experiment
seriously enough

2682
01:06:22,340 --> 01:06:22,350
seriously enough
 

2683
01:06:22,350 --> 01:06:25,550
seriously enough
and in a public and so this is happening

2684
01:06:25,550 --> 01:06:25,560
and in a public and so this is happening
 

2685
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:30,740
and in a public and so this is happening
and the interesting thing is what what

2686
01:06:30,740 --> 01:06:30,750
and the interesting thing is what what
 

2687
01:06:30,750 --> 01:06:34,400
and the interesting thing is what what
happens before and how do people prepare

2688
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:34,410
happens before and how do people prepare
 

2689
01:06:34,410 --> 01:06:36,290
happens before and how do people prepare
themselves and how they run pilot

2690
01:06:36,290 --> 01:06:36,300
themselves and how they run pilot
 

2691
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:38,660
themselves and how they run pilot
experiments it's going to train the way

2692
01:06:38,660 --> 01:06:38,670
experiments it's going to train the way
 

2693
01:06:38,670 --> 01:06:40,790
experiments it's going to train the way
psychologies done and it's already

2694
01:06:40,790 --> 01:06:40,800
psychologies done and it's already
 

2695
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:41,600
psychologies done and it's already
happening

2696
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:41,610
happening
 

2697
01:06:41,610 --> 01:06:44,990
happening
do you ever hope for as my connect to

2698
01:06:44,990 --> 01:06:45,000
do you ever hope for as my connect to
 

2699
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:49,730
do you ever hope for as my connect to
the this study sample size yeah I do

2700
01:06:49,730 --> 01:06:49,740
the this study sample size yeah I do
 

2701
01:06:49,740 --> 01:06:52,640
the this study sample size yeah I do
ever hope for the internet or do you

2702
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:52,650
ever hope for the internet or do you
 

2703
01:06:52,650 --> 01:06:54,530
ever hope for the internet or do you
know this is really happening

2704
01:06:54,530 --> 01:06:54,540
know this is really happening
 

2705
01:06:54,540 --> 01:06:58,130
know this is really happening
MTurk yeah everybody is running

2706
01:06:58,130 --> 01:06:58,140
MTurk yeah everybody is running
 

2707
01:06:58,140 --> 01:07:00,980
MTurk yeah everybody is running
experiments on him to look and and it's

2708
01:07:00,980 --> 01:07:00,990
experiments on him to look and and it's
 

2709
01:07:00,990 --> 01:07:04,670
experiments on him to look and and it's
very cheap and very effective do you

2710
01:07:04,670 --> 01:07:04,680
very cheap and very effective do you
 

2711
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:06,170
very cheap and very effective do you
think that changes psychology

2712
01:07:06,170 --> 01:07:06,180
think that changes psychology
 

2713
01:07:06,180 --> 01:07:08,470
think that changes psychology
essentially because you're think you can

2714
01:07:08,470 --> 01:07:08,480
essentially because you're think you can
 

2715
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:11,870
essentially because you're think you can
object it then truly it will I mean I

2716
01:07:11,870 --> 01:07:11,880
object it then truly it will I mean I
 

2717
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:16,100
object it then truly it will I mean I
you know I can't put my finger on how

2718
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:16,110
you know I can't put my finger on how
 

2719
01:07:16,110 --> 01:07:19,670
you know I can't put my finger on how
exactly but it that's been true in

2720
01:07:19,670 --> 01:07:19,680
exactly but it that's been true in
 

2721
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:22,490
exactly but it that's been true in
psychology with whenever an important

2722
01:07:22,490 --> 01:07:22,500
psychology with whenever an important
 

2723
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:25,310
psychology with whenever an important
new method came in it changes the feel

2724
01:07:25,310 --> 01:07:25,320
new method came in it changes the feel
 

2725
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:28,990
new method came in it changes the feel
so and an M torque is really a method

2726
01:07:28,990 --> 01:07:29,000
so and an M torque is really a method
 

2727
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,940
so and an M torque is really a method
because exact it makes it very much

2728
01:07:31,940 --> 01:07:31,950
because exact it makes it very much
 

2729
01:07:31,950 --> 01:07:34,480
because exact it makes it very much
easier to do something to do some things

2730
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:34,490
easier to do something to do some things
 

2731
01:07:34,490 --> 01:07:38,090
easier to do something to do some things
is there are undergrad students will ask

2732
01:07:38,090 --> 01:07:38,100
is there are undergrad students will ask
 

2733
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:40,340
is there are undergrad students will ask
me you know how big a neural network

2734
01:07:40,340 --> 01:07:40,350
me you know how big a neural network
 

2735
01:07:40,350 --> 01:07:42,500
me you know how big a neural network
should be for a particular problem so

2736
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:42,510
should be for a particular problem so
 

2737
01:07:42,510 --> 01:07:44,540
should be for a particular problem so
let me ask you an equivalent equivalent

2738
01:07:44,540 --> 01:07:44,550
let me ask you an equivalent equivalent
 

2739
01:07:44,550 --> 01:07:49,970
let me ask you an equivalent equivalent
question how big how many subjects they

2740
01:07:49,970 --> 01:07:49,980
question how big how many subjects they
 

2741
01:07:49,980 --> 01:07:52,760
question how big how many subjects they
study have for it to have a conclusive

2742
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:52,770
study have for it to have a conclusive
 

2743
01:07:52,770 --> 01:07:55,910
study have for it to have a conclusive
result well depends on the strength of

2744
01:07:55,910 --> 01:07:55,920
result well depends on the strength of
 

2745
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:58,940
result well depends on the strength of
the effect so if you're studying visual

2746
01:07:58,940 --> 01:07:58,950
the effect so if you're studying visual
 

2747
01:07:58,950 --> 01:08:02,390
the effect so if you're studying visual
perception the perception of color many

2748
01:08:02,390 --> 01:08:02,400
perception the perception of color many
 

2749
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:05,920
perception the perception of color many
other are the classic results in in

2750
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:05,930
other are the classic results in in
 

2751
01:08:05,930 --> 01:08:08,990
other are the classic results in in
visual in color perception we've done on

2752
01:08:08,990 --> 01:08:09,000
visual in color perception we've done on
 

2753
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,850
visual in color perception we've done on
three or four people and I think and one

2754
01:08:10,850 --> 01:08:10,860
three or four people and I think and one
 

2755
01:08:10,860 --> 01:08:12,950
three or four people and I think and one
of them was called a blind but or they'd

2756
01:08:12,950 --> 01:08:12,960
of them was called a blind but or they'd
 

2757
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:17,540
of them was called a blind but or they'd
partly colorblind but on vision you know

2758
01:08:17,540 --> 01:08:17,550
partly colorblind but on vision you know
 

2759
01:08:17,550 --> 01:08:23,870
partly colorblind but on vision you know
you belong many people don't need a lot

2760
01:08:23,870 --> 01:08:23,880
you belong many people don't need a lot
 

2761
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:26,440
you belong many people don't need a lot
of replications for some type of

2762
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:26,450
of replications for some type of
 

2763
01:08:26,450 --> 01:08:31,070
of replications for some type of
neurological experiment neuro

2764
01:08:31,070 --> 01:08:31,080
neurological experiment neuro
 

2765
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:34,800

when you're studying weaker phenomena

2766
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:34,810
when you're studying weaker phenomena
 

2767
01:08:34,810 --> 01:08:37,470
when you're studying weaker phenomena
and especially when you're studying them

2768
01:08:37,470 --> 01:08:37,480
and especially when you're studying them
 

2769
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:40,230
and especially when you're studying them
between subjects then you need a lot

2770
01:08:40,230 --> 01:08:40,240
between subjects then you need a lot
 

2771
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:41,940
between subjects then you need a lot
more subjects than people have been

2772
01:08:41,940 --> 01:08:41,950
more subjects than people have been
 

2773
01:08:41,950 --> 01:08:45,990
more subjects than people have been
running and that is that's one of the

2774
01:08:45,990 --> 01:08:46,000
running and that is that's one of the
 

2775
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,820
running and that is that's one of the
things that are happening in psychology

2776
01:08:47,820 --> 01:08:47,830
things that are happening in psychology
 

2777
01:08:47,830 --> 01:08:50,550
things that are happening in psychology
now is that the power is a statistical

2778
01:08:50,550 --> 01:08:50,560
now is that the power is a statistical
 

2779
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:52,980
now is that the power is a statistical
power the experiment is increasing

2780
01:08:52,980 --> 01:08:52,990
power the experiment is increasing
 

2781
01:08:52,990 --> 01:08:55,740
power the experiment is increasing
rapidly does that between subjects as

2782
01:08:55,740 --> 01:08:55,750
rapidly does that between subjects as
 

2783
01:08:55,750 --> 01:08:58,380
rapidly does that between subjects as
the number of subjects goes to infinity

2784
01:08:58,380 --> 01:08:58,390
the number of subjects goes to infinity
 

2785
01:08:58,390 --> 01:09:01,620
the number of subjects goes to infinity
approach well I mean you know goes to

2786
01:09:01,620 --> 01:09:01,630
approach well I mean you know goes to
 

2787
01:09:01,630 --> 01:09:04,800
approach well I mean you know goes to
infinity is exaggerated but people the

2788
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:04,810
infinity is exaggerated but people the
 

2789
01:09:04,810 --> 01:09:07,500
infinity is exaggerated but people the
standard number of subjects for an

2790
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:07,510
standard number of subjects for an
 

2791
01:09:07,510 --> 01:09:12,050
standard number of subjects for an

2792
01:09:12,050 --> 01:09:12,060
experiment psychology with 30 or 40 and
 

2793
01:09:12,060 --> 01:09:15,660
experiment psychology with 30 or 40 and
for a weak effect that's simply not

2794
01:09:15,660 --> 01:09:15,670
for a weak effect that's simply not
 

2795
01:09:15,670 --> 01:09:19,890
for a weak effect that's simply not
enough and you may need a couple of

2796
01:09:19,890 --> 01:09:19,900
enough and you may need a couple of
 

2797
01:09:19,900 --> 01:09:24,770
enough and you may need a couple of
hundred I mean it's that that sort of

2798
01:09:24,770 --> 01:09:24,780
hundred I mean it's that that sort of
 

2799
01:09:24,780 --> 01:09:30,140
hundred I mean it's that that sort of
order of magnitude what are the major

2800
01:09:30,140 --> 01:09:30,150
order of magnitude what are the major
 

2801
01:09:30,150 --> 01:09:33,150
order of magnitude what are the major
disagreements in theories and effects

2802
01:09:33,150 --> 01:09:33,160
disagreements in theories and effects
 

2803
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:35,970
disagreements in theories and effects
that you've observed throughout your

2804
01:09:35,970 --> 01:09:35,980
that you've observed throughout your
 

2805
01:09:35,980 --> 01:09:36,809
that you've observed throughout your
career

2806

career
 

2807
01:09:36,819 --> 01:09:39,150
career
that's the stand today well you work on

2808
01:09:39,150 --> 01:09:39,160
that's the stand today well you work on
 

2809
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:42,360
that's the stand today well you work on
several fields yeah but what still is

2810
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:42,370
several fields yeah but what still is
 

2811
01:09:42,370 --> 01:09:45,329
several fields yeah but what still is
out there as major disagreement offs in

2812
01:09:45,329 --> 01:09:45,339
out there as major disagreement offs in
 

2813
01:09:45,339 --> 01:09:49,380
out there as major disagreement offs in
your mind and I've had one extreme

2814
01:09:49,380 --> 01:09:49,390
your mind and I've had one extreme
 

2815
01:09:49,390 --> 01:09:52,710
your mind and I've had one extreme
experience of you know controversy with

2816
01:09:52,710 --> 01:09:52,720
experience of you know controversy with
 

2817
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:55,380
experience of you know controversy with
somebody who really doesn't like the

2818
01:09:55,380 --> 01:09:55,390
somebody who really doesn't like the
 

2819
01:09:55,390 --> 01:09:58,020
somebody who really doesn't like the
work that they must risky and I did and

2820
01:09:58,020 --> 01:09:58,030
work that they must risky and I did and
 

2821
01:09:58,030 --> 01:10:01,320
work that they must risky and I did and
he's been after us for 30 years or more

2822
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:01,330
he's been after us for 30 years or more
 

2823
01:10:01,330 --> 01:10:04,380
he's been after us for 30 years or more
at least when I talk about it well I

2824
01:10:04,380 --> 01:10:04,390
at least when I talk about it well I
 

2825
01:10:04,390 --> 01:10:06,540
at least when I talk about it well I
mean his name is good Giga answer he's a

2826
01:10:06,540 --> 01:10:06,550
mean his name is good Giga answer he's a
 

2827
01:10:06,550 --> 01:10:09,350
mean his name is good Giga answer he's a
well-known German psychologist and

2828
01:10:09,350 --> 01:10:09,360
well-known German psychologist and
 

2829
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:12,630
well-known German psychologist and
that's the one controversy I have which

2830
01:10:12,630 --> 01:10:12,640
that's the one controversy I have which
 

2831
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:18,300
that's the one controversy I have which
I it's been unpleasant and no I don't

2832
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:18,310
I it's been unpleasant and no I don't
 

2833
01:10:18,310 --> 01:10:21,060
I it's been unpleasant and no I don't
particularly want to talk about it but

2834
01:10:21,060 --> 01:10:21,070
particularly want to talk about it but
 

2835
01:10:21,070 --> 01:10:23,160
particularly want to talk about it but
it's there is their open questions even

2836
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:23,170
it's there is their open questions even
 

2837
01:10:23,170 --> 01:10:24,810
it's there is their open questions even
in your own mind every once in a while

2838
01:10:24,810 --> 01:10:24,820
in your own mind every once in a while
 

2839
01:10:24,820 --> 01:10:28,290
in your own mind every once in a while
you know we talked about semi autonomous

2840
01:10:28,290 --> 01:10:28,300
you know we talked about semi autonomous
 

2841
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:30,780
you know we talked about semi autonomous
vehicles in my own mind I see what the

2842
01:10:30,780 --> 01:10:30,790
vehicles in my own mind I see what the
 

2843
01:10:30,790 --> 01:10:34,890
vehicles in my own mind I see what the
data says but I also constantly torn do

2844
01:10:34,890 --> 01:10:34,900
data says but I also constantly torn do
 

2845
01:10:34,900 --> 01:10:36,810
data says but I also constantly torn do
you have things where you or your

2846
01:10:36,810 --> 01:10:36,820
you have things where you or your
 

2847
01:10:36,820 --> 01:10:38,400
you have things where you or your
studies have found something but you're

2848
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:38,410
studies have found something but you're
 

2849
01:10:38,410 --> 01:10:40,470
studies have found something but you're
also intellectually torn about what it

2850
01:10:40,470 --> 01:10:40,480
also intellectually torn about what it
 

2851
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:43,410
also intellectually torn about what it
means and there's been maybe

2852
01:10:43,410 --> 01:10:43,420
means and there's been maybe
 

2853
01:10:43,420 --> 01:10:44,259
means and there's been maybe
disagreement

2854
01:10:44,259 --> 01:10:44,269
disagreement
 

2855
01:10:44,269 --> 01:10:46,439
disagreement
you within your own mind about

2856
01:10:46,439 --> 01:10:46,449
you within your own mind about
 

2857
01:10:46,449 --> 01:10:48,970
you within your own mind about
particularly I mean it's you know one of

2858
01:10:48,970 --> 01:10:48,980
particularly I mean it's you know one of
 

2859
01:10:48,980 --> 01:10:51,489
particularly I mean it's you know one of
the things that are interesting is how

2860
01:10:51,489 --> 01:10:51,499
the things that are interesting is how
 

2861
01:10:51,499 --> 01:10:53,290
the things that are interesting is how
difficult it is for people to change

2862
01:10:53,290 --> 01:10:53,300
difficult it is for people to change
 

2863
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:58,359
difficult it is for people to change
their mind essentially you know once

2864
01:10:58,359 --> 01:10:58,369
their mind essentially you know once
 

2865
01:10:58,369 --> 01:11:00,879
their mind essentially you know once
they're committed people just don't

2866
01:11:00,879 --> 01:11:00,889
they're committed people just don't
 

2867
01:11:00,889 --> 01:11:02,439
they're committed people just don't
change their mind about anything that

2868
01:11:02,439 --> 01:11:02,449
change their mind about anything that
 

2869
01:11:02,449 --> 01:11:05,500
change their mind about anything that
matters and that is surprisingly but

2870
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:05,510
matters and that is surprisingly but
 

2871
01:11:05,510 --> 01:11:08,290
matters and that is surprisingly but
it's true about scientists so the

2872
01:11:08,290 --> 01:11:08,300
it's true about scientists so the
 

2873
01:11:08,300 --> 01:11:11,649
it's true about scientists so the
controversy that I described in other

2874
01:11:11,649 --> 01:11:11,659
controversy that I described in other
 

2875
01:11:11,659 --> 01:11:13,390
controversy that I described in other
it's been going on like thirty years and

2876
01:11:13,390 --> 01:11:13,400
it's been going on like thirty years and
 

2877
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:17,439
it's been going on like thirty years and
it's never going to be resolved and you

2878
01:11:17,439 --> 01:11:17,449
it's never going to be resolved and you
 

2879
01:11:17,449 --> 01:11:19,450
it's never going to be resolved and you
build a system and you live within that

2880
01:11:19,450 --> 01:11:19,460
build a system and you live within that
 

2881
01:11:19,460 --> 01:11:22,720
build a system and you live within that
system and other other systems of ideas

2882
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:22,730
system and other other systems of ideas
 

2883
01:11:22,730 --> 01:11:27,399
system and other other systems of ideas
look foreign to you and there is very

2884
01:11:27,399 --> 01:11:27,409
look foreign to you and there is very
 

2885
01:11:27,409 --> 01:11:30,220
look foreign to you and there is very
little contact and very little mutual

2886
01:11:30,220 --> 01:11:30,230
little contact and very little mutual
 

2887
01:11:30,230 --> 01:11:32,649
little contact and very little mutual
influence that happens a fair amount

2888
01:11:32,649 --> 01:11:32,659
influence that happens a fair amount
 

2889
01:11:32,659 --> 01:11:37,689
influence that happens a fair amount
do you ever hopeful advice or message on

2890
01:11:37,689 --> 01:11:37,699
do you ever hopeful advice or message on
 

2891
01:11:37,699 --> 01:11:40,779
do you ever hopeful advice or message on
that we think about science thinking

2892
01:11:40,779 --> 01:11:40,789
that we think about science thinking
 

2893
01:11:40,789 --> 01:11:44,140
that we think about science thinking
about politics thinking about things

2894
01:11:44,140 --> 01:11:44,150
about politics thinking about things
 

2895
01:11:44,150 --> 01:11:47,140
about politics thinking about things
that have impact on this world how can

2896
01:11:47,140 --> 01:11:47,150
that have impact on this world how can
 

2897
01:11:47,150 --> 01:11:52,149
that have impact on this world how can
we change your mind I think that I mean

2898
01:11:52,149 --> 01:11:52,159
we change your mind I think that I mean
 

2899
01:11:52,159 --> 01:11:55,689
we change your mind I think that I mean
on things that matter or a political or

2900
01:11:55,689 --> 01:11:55,699
on things that matter or a political or
 

2901
01:11:55,699 --> 01:11:59,439
on things that matter or a political or
a little religious and people just don't

2902
01:11:59,439 --> 01:11:59,449
a little religious and people just don't
 

2903
01:11:59,449 --> 01:12:03,430
a little religious and people just don't
don't change their mind and by and large

2904
01:12:03,430 --> 01:12:03,440
don't change their mind and by and large
 

2905
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:05,680
don't change their mind and by and large
and there is very little that you can do

2906
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:05,690
and there is very little that you can do
 

2907
01:12:05,690 --> 01:12:11,410
and there is very little that you can do
about it the what does happen is that if

2908
01:12:11,410 --> 01:12:11,420
about it the what does happen is that if
 

2909
01:12:11,420 --> 01:12:15,509
about it the what does happen is that if
leaders change their mind so for example

2910
01:12:15,509 --> 01:12:15,519
leaders change their mind so for example
 

2911
01:12:15,519 --> 01:12:18,640
leaders change their mind so for example
the public the American public doesn't

2912
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:18,650
the public the American public doesn't
 

2913
01:12:18,650 --> 01:12:21,160
the public the American public doesn't
really believe in climate change doesn't

2914
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:21,170
really believe in climate change doesn't
 

2915
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:24,040
really believe in climate change doesn't
take it very seriously but if some

2916
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:24,050
take it very seriously but if some
 

2917
01:12:24,050 --> 01:12:27,189
take it very seriously but if some
religious leaders decided this is a

2918
01:12:27,189 --> 01:12:27,199
religious leaders decided this is a
 

2919
01:12:27,199 --> 01:12:29,169
religious leaders decided this is a
major threat to humanity

2920
01:12:29,169 --> 01:12:29,179
major threat to humanity
 

2921
01:12:29,179 --> 01:12:32,459
major threat to humanity
that would have a big effect so that we

2922
01:12:32,459 --> 01:12:32,469
that would have a big effect so that we
 

2923
01:12:32,469 --> 01:12:35,560
that would have a big effect so that we
we have the opinions that we have not

2924
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:35,570
we have the opinions that we have not
 

2925
01:12:35,570 --> 01:12:37,750
we have the opinions that we have not
because we know why we have them but

2926
01:12:37,750 --> 01:12:37,760
because we know why we have them but
 

2927
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:39,879
because we know why we have them but
because we trust some people and we

2928
01:12:39,879 --> 01:12:39,889
because we trust some people and we
 

2929
01:12:39,889 --> 01:12:44,200
because we trust some people and we
don't trust other people and so it's

2930
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:44,210
don't trust other people and so it's
 

2931
01:12:44,210 --> 01:12:47,319
don't trust other people and so it's
much less about evidence than it is

2932
01:12:47,319 --> 01:12:47,329
much less about evidence than it is
 

2933
01:12:47,329 --> 01:12:50,620
much less about evidence than it is
about stories so the way one way to

2934
01:12:50,620 --> 01:12:50,630
about stories so the way one way to
 

2935
01:12:50,630 --> 01:12:52,930
about stories so the way one way to
change your mind isn't at the individual

2936
01:12:52,930 --> 01:12:52,940
change your mind isn't at the individual
 

2937
01:12:52,940 --> 01:12:55,239
change your mind isn't at the individual
level is that the leaders of the

2938
01:12:55,239 --> 01:12:55,249
level is that the leaders of the
 

2939
01:12:55,249 --> 01:12:57,489
level is that the leaders of the
communities you look up with the stories

2940
01:12:57,489 --> 01:12:57,499
communities you look up with the stories
 

2941
01:12:57,499 --> 01:12:58,180
communities you look up with the stories
change

2942
01:12:58,180 --> 01:12:58,190
change
 

2943
01:12:58,190 --> 01:12:59,680
change
and therefore your mind changes with

2944
01:12:59,680 --> 01:12:59,690
and therefore your mind changes with
 

2945
01:12:59,690 --> 01:13:03,700
and therefore your mind changes with
them so there's a guy named Alan Turing

2946
01:13:03,700 --> 01:13:03,710
them so there's a guy named Alan Turing
 

2947
01:13:03,710 --> 01:13:07,270
them so there's a guy named Alan Turing
came up with a touring test yeah

2948
01:13:07,270 --> 01:13:07,280
came up with a touring test yeah
 

2949
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:09,600
came up with a touring test yeah
what what do you think is a good test of

2950
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:09,610
what what do you think is a good test of
 

2951
01:13:09,610 --> 01:13:14,680
what what do you think is a good test of
intelligence perhaps we're drifting in a

2952
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:14,690
intelligence perhaps we're drifting in a
 

2953
01:13:14,690 --> 01:13:18,700
intelligence perhaps we're drifting in a
topic that were maybe philosophizing

2954
01:13:18,700 --> 01:13:18,710
topic that were maybe philosophizing
 

2955
01:13:18,710 --> 01:13:20,020
topic that were maybe philosophizing
about but what do you think is a good

2956
01:13:20,020 --> 01:13:20,030
about but what do you think is a good
 

2957
01:13:20,030 --> 01:13:21,610
about but what do you think is a good
test for intelligence for an artificial

2958
01:13:21,610 --> 01:13:21,620
test for intelligence for an artificial
 

2959
01:13:21,620 --> 01:13:25,540
test for intelligence for an artificial
intelligence system well the standard

2960
01:13:25,540 --> 01:13:25,550
intelligence system well the standard
 

2961
01:13:25,550 --> 01:13:29,740
intelligence system well the standard
definition of you know official general

2962
01:13:29,740 --> 01:13:29,750
definition of you know official general
 

2963
01:13:29,750 --> 01:13:32,830
definition of you know official general
intelligence is that it can do anything

2964
01:13:32,830 --> 01:13:32,840
intelligence is that it can do anything
 

2965
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:34,540
intelligence is that it can do anything
that people can do and it can do them

2966
01:13:34,540 --> 01:13:34,550
that people can do and it can do them
 

2967
01:13:34,550 --> 01:13:37,600
that people can do and it can do them
better yes what what we are seeing is

2968
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:37,610
better yes what what we are seeing is
 

2969
01:13:37,610 --> 01:13:39,880
better yes what what we are seeing is
that in many domains you have

2970
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:39,890
that in many domains you have
 

2971
01:13:39,890 --> 01:13:46,780
that in many domains you have
domain-specific and you know devices or

2972
01:13:46,780 --> 01:13:46,790
domain-specific and you know devices or
 

2973
01:13:46,790 --> 01:13:49,420
domain-specific and you know devices or
programs or software and they beat

2974
01:13:49,420 --> 01:13:49,430
programs or software and they beat
 

2975
01:13:49,430 --> 01:13:53,440
programs or software and they beat
people easily in specified way but we

2976
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:53,450
people easily in specified way but we
 

2977
01:13:53,450 --> 01:13:56,530
people easily in specified way but we
are very far from is either generally

2978
01:13:56,530 --> 01:13:56,540
are very far from is either generally
 

2979
01:13:56,540 --> 01:13:59,080
are very far from is either generally
ability a general-purpose intelligence

2980
01:13:59,080 --> 01:13:59,090
ability a general-purpose intelligence
 

2981
01:13:59,090 --> 01:14:05,350
ability a general-purpose intelligence
so we in in machine learning people are

2982
01:14:05,350 --> 01:14:05,360
so we in in machine learning people are
 

2983
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:07,480
so we in in machine learning people are
approaching something more general I

2984
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:07,490
approaching something more general I
 

2985
01:14:07,490 --> 01:14:11,470
approaching something more general I
mean for alpha 0 ISM was much more

2986
01:14:11,470 --> 01:14:11,480
mean for alpha 0 ISM was much more
 

2987
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:16,330
mean for alpha 0 ISM was much more
general than than alphago and but it's

2988
01:14:16,330 --> 01:14:16,340
general than than alphago and but it's
 

2989
01:14:16,340 --> 01:14:18,850
general than than alphago and but it's
still extraordinarily narrow and

2990
01:14:18,850 --> 01:14:18,860
still extraordinarily narrow and
 

2991
01:14:18,860 --> 01:14:22,510
still extraordinarily narrow and
specific in what it can do so we're

2992
01:14:22,510 --> 01:14:22,520
specific in what it can do so we're
 

2993
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:26,110
specific in what it can do so we're
quite far from from something that can

2994
01:14:26,110 --> 01:14:26,120
quite far from from something that can
 

2995
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:28,720
quite far from from something that can
in every domain think like a human

2996
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:28,730
in every domain think like a human
 

2997
01:14:28,730 --> 01:14:32,860

and humor would be more impressive than
 

3021
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:08,510
and humor would be more impressive than
just factual conversation which i think

3022
01:15:08,510 --> 01:15:08,520
just factual conversation which i think
 

3023
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:13,250
just factual conversation which i think
is is easy and illusions would be

3024
01:15:13,250 --> 01:15:13,260
is is easy and illusions would be
 

3025
01:15:13,260 --> 01:15:17,510
is is easy and illusions would be
interesting and metaphors would be

3026
01:15:17,510 --> 01:15:17,520
interesting and metaphors would be
 

3027
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:21,460
interesting and metaphors would be
interesting I mean but new metaphors not

3028
01:15:21,460 --> 01:15:21,470
interesting I mean but new metaphors not
 

3029
01:15:21,470 --> 01:15:25,760
interesting I mean but new metaphors not
practice metaphors so there's a lot that

3030
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:25,770
practice metaphors so there's a lot that
 

3031
01:15:25,770 --> 01:15:28,970
practice metaphors so there's a lot that
you know would be sort of impressive and

find the whole thing fascinating
 

3049
01:15:50,060 --> 01:15:52,850
find the whole thing fascinating
absolutely fascinating exciting I think

3050
01:15:52,850 --> 01:15:52,860
absolutely fascinating exciting I think
 

3051
01:15:52,860 --> 01:15:55,850

3055
01:16:00,240 --> 01:16:04,460
know but but I'm not going to be around
to see it and so I'm curious about what

3056
01:16:04,460 --> 01:16:04,470
to see it and so I'm curious about what
 

3057
01:16:04,470 --> 01:16:06,680
to see it and so I'm curious about what
is happening now but I also know that

3058
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:06,690
is happening now but I also know that
 

3059
01:16:06,690 --> 01:16:12,050
is happening now but I also know that
that predictions about it are silly we

3060
01:16:12,050 --> 01:16:12,060
that predictions about it are silly we
 

3061
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:14,390
that predictions about it are silly we
really have no idea but it will look

3062
01:16:14,390 --> 01:16:14,400
really have no idea but it will look
 

3063
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:15,740
really have no idea but it will look
like 30 years from now

3064
01:16:15,740 --> 01:16:15,750
like 30 years from now
 

3065
01:16:15,750 --> 01:16:20,840
like 30 years from now
