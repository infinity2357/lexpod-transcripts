robot capability is it's kind of a I
 

163
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:24,759
robot capability is it's kind of a I
think it's a very tricky thing to to

164
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:24,769
think it's a very tricky thing to to
 

165
00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:27,430
think it's a very tricky thing to to
understand because there are some things

166
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:27,440
understand because there are some things
 

167
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,570
understand because there are some things
that are difficult that we wouldn't

168
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:28,580
that are difficult that we wouldn't
 

169
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,770
that are difficult that we wouldn't
think are difficult and some things that

170
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:29,780
think are difficult and some things that
 

171
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,240
think are difficult and some things that
are easy that we wouldn't think ever you

172
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:31,250
are easy that we wouldn't think ever you
 

173
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:34,120
are easy that we wouldn't think ever you
see and there's also a really big gap

174
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:34,130
see and there's also a really big gap
 

175
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,490
see and there's also a really big gap
between capabilities of robots in terms

176
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:36,500
between capabilities of robots in terms
 

177
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,110
between capabilities of robots in terms
of hardware and their physical

178
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:38,120
of hardware and their physical
 

179
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,449
of hardware and their physical
capability and capabilities of robots in

180
00:03:40,449 --> 00:03:40,459
capability and capabilities of robots in
 

181
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:42,090
capability and capabilities of robots in
terms of what they can do autonomously

182
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:42,100
terms of what they can do autonomously
 

183
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,160
terms of what they can do autonomously
there is a little video that I think

184
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:45,170
there is a little video that I think
 

185
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:47,080
there is a little video that I think
robotics researchers really like to show

186
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:47,090
robotics researchers really like to show
 

187
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:48,370
robotics researchers really like to show
a special Robotics learning researchers

188
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:48,380
a special Robotics learning researchers
 

189
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:51,580
a special Robotics learning researchers
like myself from 2004 from Stanford

190
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:51,590
like myself from 2004 from Stanford
 

191
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:54,190
like myself from 2004 from Stanford
which demonstrates a prototype robot

00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:54,200
which demonstrates a prototype robot
 

193
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,170
which demonstrates a prototype robot
called the PR one and the PR one was a

194
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:56,180
called the PR one and the PR one was a
 

195
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,090
called the PR one and the PR one was a
robot that was designed as a home

196
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:58,100
robot that was designed as a home
 

197
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,560
robot that was designed as a home
assistance robot and there's this

198
00:03:59,560 --> 00:03:59,570
assistance robot and there's this
 

199
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:02,140

beautiful video showing the pr1 tidying

200
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:02,150
beautiful video showing the pr1 tidying
 

201
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,720
beautiful video showing the pr1 tidying
up a living room putting away toys and

202
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:04,730
up a living room putting away toys and
 

203
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:08,170
up a living room putting away toys and
at the end bringing a beer to the person

204
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:08,180
at the end bringing a beer to the person
 

205
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,330
at the end bringing a beer to the person
sitting on the couch which looks really

206
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:10,340
sitting on the couch which looks really
 

207
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:13,059
sitting on the couch which looks really
amazing and then the punch line is that

208
00:04:13,059 --> 00:04:13,069
amazing and then the punch line is that
 

209
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:13,980
amazing and then the punch line is that
this

210
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:13,990
this
 

211
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:16,110
this
is entirely controlled by person yes so

212
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:16,120
is entirely controlled by person yes so
 

213
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,000
is entirely controlled by person yes so
you can so that in some ways the gap

214
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,010
you can so that in some ways the gap
 

215
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:19,260
you can so that in some ways the gap
between a state-of-the-art human

216
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:19,270
between a state-of-the-art human
 

217
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:21,120
between a state-of-the-art human
state-of-the-art robot if the robot has

218
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,130
state-of-the-art robot if the robot has
 

219
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:23,700
state-of-the-art robot if the robot has
a human brain is actually not that large

220
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:23,710
a human brain is actually not that large
 

221
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:25,080
a human brain is actually not that large
now obviously like human bodies are

222
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:25,090
now obviously like human bodies are
 

223
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:26,880
now obviously like human bodies are
sophisticated and very robust and

224
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:26,890
sophisticated and very robust and
 

225
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:28,770
sophisticated and very robust and
resilient in many ways but on the whole

226
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:28,780
resilient in many ways but on the whole
 

227
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:31,050
resilient in many ways but on the whole
if we're willing to like spend a bit of

228
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:31,060
if we're willing to like spend a bit of
 

229
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,790
if we're willing to like spend a bit of
money and do a bit of engineering we can

230
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:32,800
money and do a bit of engineering we can
 

231
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,850
money and do a bit of engineering we can
kind of close the hardware gap almost

232
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:34,860
kind of close the hardware gap almost
 

233
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,690
kind of close the hardware gap almost
but the intelligence gap that one is

234
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:38,700
but the intelligence gap that one is
 

235
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,430
but the intelligence gap that one is
very wide and when you say hardware you

236
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:41,440
very wide and when you say hardware you
 

237
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,960
very wide and when you say hardware you
you're referring to the physical sort of

238
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:42,970
you're referring to the physical sort of
 

239
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:44,970
you're referring to the physical sort of
the actuators the actual body the robot

240
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:44,980
the actuators the actual body the robot
 

241
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:47,400
the actuators the actual body the robot
is opposed to the hardware on which the

242
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:47,410
is opposed to the hardware on which the
 

243
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:49,080
is opposed to the hardware on which the
cognition the nervous the hardware of

244
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:49,090
cognition the nervous the hardware of
 

245
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:50,820
cognition the nervous the hardware of
the nervous system yes exactly I'm

246
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:50,830
the nervous system yes exactly I'm
 

247
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,710
the nervous system yes exactly I'm
referring to the body rather than the

248
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:52,720
referring to the body rather than the
 

249
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,500
referring to the body rather than the
mind so what so that means that the kind

250
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:55,510
mind so what so that means that the kind
 

251
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,540
mind so what so that means that the kind
of the work is cut out for us like while

252
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:57,550
of the work is cut out for us like while
 

253
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,040
of the work is cut out for us like while
we can still make the body better we

254
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,050
we can still make the body better we
 

255
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:00,300
we can still make the body better we
kind of know that the big bottleneck

256
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:00,310
kind of know that the big bottleneck
 

257
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:03,300
kind of know that the big bottleneck
right now is really the mind and how big

258
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:03,310
right now is really the mind and how big
 

259
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:06,240
right now is really the mind and how big
is that gap how big is the how big is

260
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:06,250
is that gap how big is the how big is
 

261
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,120
is that gap how big is the how big is
the difference in your in your sense of

262
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:08,130
the difference in your in your sense of
 

263
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:10,800
the difference in your in your sense of
ability to learn a bit ability to reason

264
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:10,810
ability to learn a bit ability to reason
 

265
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,950
ability to learn a bit ability to reason
ability to perceive the world between

266
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:12,960
ability to perceive the world between
 

267
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,250
ability to perceive the world between
humans and our best robots the gap is

268
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:17,260
humans and our best robots the gap is
 

269
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:20,460
humans and our best robots the gap is
very large and the gap becomes larger

270
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:20,470
very large and the gap becomes larger
 

271
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:23,820
very large and the gap becomes larger
the more unexpected events can happen in

272
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:23,830
the more unexpected events can happen in
 

273
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:26,070
the more unexpected events can happen in
the world so essentially the spectrum

274
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:26,080
the world so essentially the spectrum
 

275
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,730
the world so essentially the spectrum
along which you can measure the the size

276
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:29,740
along which you can measure the the size
 

277
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,290
along which you can measure the the size
of that gap is the spectrum of how open

278
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:31,300
of that gap is the spectrum of how open
 

279
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,880
of that gap is the spectrum of how open
the world is if you control everything

280
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:32,890
the world is if you control everything
 

281
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:34,410
the world is if you control everything
in the world very tightly if you put the

282
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:34,420
in the world very tightly if you put the
 

283
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:36,630
in the world very tightly if you put the
robot in like a factory and you tell it

284
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:36,640
robot in like a factory and you tell it
 

285
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,280
robot in like a factory and you tell it
where everything is and you rigidly

286
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:38,290
where everything is and you rigidly
 

287
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:41,430
where everything is and you rigidly
program its motion then it can do things

288
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:41,440
program its motion then it can do things
 

289
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,780
program its motion then it can do things
you know one might even say in a

290
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:42,790
you know one might even say in a
 

291
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,520
you know one might even say in a
superhuman way it can move faster it's

292
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:44,530
superhuman way it can move faster it's
 

293
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:46,080
superhuman way it can move faster it's
stronger it can lift up a car and things

294
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:46,090
stronger it can lift up a car and things
 

295
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:48,960
stronger it can lift up a car and things
like that but as soon as anything starts

296
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:48,970
like that but as soon as anything starts
 

297
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:50,790
like that but as soon as anything starts
to vary in the environment now it'll

298
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:50,800
to vary in the environment now it'll
 

299
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,500
to vary in the environment now it'll
trip up and if many many things vary

300
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:52,510
trip up and if many many things vary
 

301
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,790
trip up and if many many things vary
like they would like in your kitchen for

302
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:53,800
like they would like in your kitchen for
 

303
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,000
like they would like in your kitchen for
example then things are pretty much like

304
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,010
example then things are pretty much like
 

305
00:05:57,010 --> 00:06:00,210
example then things are pretty much like
wide open now again we're gonna stick a

306
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:00,220
wide open now again we're gonna stick a
 

307
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:02,390
wide open now again we're gonna stick a
bit on the philosophical questions but

308
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:02,400
bit on the philosophical questions but
 

309
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,270
bit on the philosophical questions but
how much on the human side of the

310
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:06,280
how much on the human side of the
 

311
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,450
how much on the human side of the
cognitive abilities in your sense is

312
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:08,460
cognitive abilities in your sense is
 

313
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:11,730
cognitive abilities in your sense is
nature versus nurture so so how much of

314
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:11,740
nature versus nurture so so how much of
 

315
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:17,460
nature versus nurture so so how much of
it is product of evolution and how much

316
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:17,470
it is product of evolution and how much
 

317
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:18,930
it is product of evolution and how much
of it something we'll learn from sort of

318
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:18,940
of it something we'll learn from sort of
 

319
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,940
of it something we'll learn from sort of

I'm going to read into your question as
 

323
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,560
I'm going to read into your question as
asking about the implications of this

324
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:25,570
asking about the implications of this
 

325
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:27,900
asking about the implications of this
for AI really

it's so if it's all about learning then

332
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:35,710
it's so if it's all about learning then

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,520
I look at this is that you know well
first of course biology is very messy

first of course biology is very messy
 

339
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:47,610
first of course biology is very messy
and it's if you ask the question how

340
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:47,620
and it's if you ask the question how
 

341
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,470
and it's if you ask the question how
does a person do something or has a

342
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:49,480
does a person do something or has a
 

343
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,660
does a person do something or has a
person's mind do something you come up

00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:51,670
person's mind do something you come up
 

345
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:53,190
person's mind do something you come up
with a bunch of hypotheses and

with a bunch of hypotheses and
 

347
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,900
with a bunch of hypotheses and
oftentimes you can find support for many

00:06:59,760 --> 00:06:59,770
one way that we can approach the
 

353
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:02,010
one way that we can approach the
question of what the implication of this

question of what the implication of this
 

355
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,170
question of what the implication of this
for AI R is we can think about what's

356
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:04,180
for AI R is we can think about what's
 

357
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:07,640
for AI R is we can think about what's
sufficient so you know maybe a person is

00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:07,650
sufficient so you know maybe a person is
 

359
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:10,200
sufficient so you know maybe a person is
from birth very very good at some things

from birth very very good at some things
 

361
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:11,580
from birth very very good at some things
like for example recognizing faces

00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:12,840
like for example recognizing faces
there's a very strong evolutionary

364
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:12,850
there's a very strong evolutionary
 

365
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:14,550
there's a very strong evolutionary
pressure to do that if you can recognize

366
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:14,560
pressure to do that if you can recognize
 

367
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,460
pressure to do that if you can recognize
your mother's face then you're more

368
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:17,470
your mother's face then you're more
 

369
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,050
your mother's face then you're more
likely to survive and therefore people

370
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:19,060
likely to survive and therefore people
 

371
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:21,120
likely to survive and therefore people
are good at this but we can also ask

00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:21,130
are good at this but we can also ask
 

373
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:22,140
are good at this but we can also ask
like what's what's the minimum

374
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:22,150
like what's what's the minimum
 

375

this robotic arm to like open this door
 

411
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,790
this robotic arm to like open this door
you'll probably manage it even though

even even ever used the joys to control
 

417
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,260
even even ever used the joys to control
us and you'll kind of muddle through it

us and you'll kind of muddle through it
 

419
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:08,010
us and you'll kind of muddle through it
and that's not your evolved natural

420
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:08,020
and that's not your evolved natural
 

421
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,020

exactly why our current robotic systems
 

427
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:15,210
exactly why our current robotic systems
really kind of fall flat but I wonder

428
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:15,220
really kind of fall flat but I wonder
 

429
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:19,080
really kind of fall flat but I wonder
how much general almost what we think of

how much general almost what we think of

00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:20,990
how much general almost what we think of
as common sense

so that ability to adapt to a joystick
 

437
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:31,920
so that ability to adapt to a joystick
is requires you to have a kind of you

is requires you to have a kind of you
know I'm human so it's hard for me to

know I'm human so it's hard for me to
 

441
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,060
know I'm human so it's hard for me to
introspect all the knowledge I have

introspect all the knowledge I have
 

443
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:37,589
introspect all the knowledge I have
about the world but it seems like there

about the world but it seems like there
 

445
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,650
about the world but it seems like there

you actually bring to the table now

you actually bring to the table now

00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,329
you actually bring to the table now
that's kind of the open question there's

00:08:45,329 --> 00:08:45,339
that's kind of the open question there's
 

453
00:08:45,339 --> 00:08:47,160
that's kind of the open question there's
absolutely an iceberg of knowledge that

454
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:47,170
absolutely an iceberg of knowledge that
 

455
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:48,960
absolutely an iceberg of knowledge that
we bring to the table but I think it's

456
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:48,970
we bring to the table but I think it's
 

457
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:51,420
we bring to the table but I think it's
very likely that iceberg of knowledge is

458
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:51,430
very likely that iceberg of knowledge is
 

459
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:52,940
very likely that iceberg of knowledge is
actually built up over our lifetimes

actually built up over our lifetimes
 

461
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:56,010
actually built up over our lifetimes
because we have you know we have a lot

462
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:56,020
because we have you know we have a lot
 

463
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:59,190
because we have you know we have a lot
of prior experience to draw on and it

464
00:08:59,190 --> 00:08:59,200
of prior experience to draw on and it
 

465
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,199
of prior experience to draw on and it
kind of makes sense that the right way

466
00:09:01,199 --> 00:09:01,209
kind of makes sense that the right way
 

467
00:09:01,209 --> 00:09:04,790
kind of makes sense that the right way
for us to you know to optimize our

468
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:04,800
for us to you know to optimize our
 

469
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,780
for us to you know to optimize our
efficiency our evolutionary fitness and

470
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:06,790
efficiency our evolutionary fitness and
 

471
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:10,230
efficiency our evolutionary fitness and
so on is to utilize all that experience

472
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:10,240
so on is to utilize all that experience
 

473
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,360
so on is to utilize all that experience
to build up the best iceberg we can get

474
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:12,370
to build up the best iceberg we can get
 

475
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:14,970
to build up the best iceberg we can get
and that's actually one you know well

476
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:14,980
and that's actually one you know well
 

477

00:12:11,059 --> 00:12:13,150
from that but if I have a bad
understanding of the world I might think

638
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:13,160
understanding of the world I might think
 

639
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,410
understanding of the world I might think
that that's a good way for me to like

640
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:14,420
that that's a good way for me to like
 

641
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:17,319
that that's a good way for me to like
you know gain more utility if I actually

642
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:17,329
you know gain more utility if I actually
 

643
00:12:17,329 --> 00:12:20,499
you know gain more utility if I actually
go about the daily life doing the things

644
00:12:20,499 --> 00:12:20,509
go about the daily life doing the things
 

645
00:12:20,509 --> 00:12:22,359
go about the daily life doing the things
that my current understanding of the

646
00:12:22,359 --> 00:12:22,369
that my current understanding of the
 

647
00:12:22,369 --> 00:12:23,679
that my current understanding of the
world suggests will give me high utility

648
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:23,689
world suggests will give me high utility
 

649
00:12:23,689 --> 00:12:26,410
world suggests will give me high utility
in some ways I'll get exactly the the

650
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:26,420
in some ways I'll get exactly the the
 

651
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:30,129
in some ways I'll get exactly the the
right supervision to tell me not to do

652
00:12:30,129 --> 00:12:30,139
right supervision to tell me not to do
 

653
00:12:30,139 --> 00:12:31,749
right supervision to tell me not to do
those those bad things and to keep doing

654
00:12:31,749 --> 00:12:31,759
those those bad things and to keep doing
 

655
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:33,970
those those bad things and to keep doing
the good things so there's a spectrum

656
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:33,980
the good things so there's a spectrum
 

657
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:37,389
the good things so there's a spectrum
between iid random walk through the

between iid random walk through the
 

659
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:39,699
between iid random walk through the

space of data and then there's and what
 

661
00:12:39,709 --> 00:12:42,069

philosophical questions I think that you

864
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:32,600
philosophical questions I think that you
 

865
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,579
philosophical questions I think that you
know maybe there are two ways I can

00:16:33,589 --> 00:16:35,199
know maybe there are two ways I can
answer this question one is there's a

00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:35,209
answer this question one is there's a
 

869
00:16:35,209 --> 00:16:37,780
answer this question one is there's a
very pragmatic problem which was like

870
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:37,790
very pragmatic problem which was like
 

871
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:41,290
very pragmatic problem which was like
what would make robots what would sort

what would make robots what would sort
 

873
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,449
what would make robots what would sort
of maximize the usefulness of robots and

874
00:16:43,449 --> 00:16:43,459
of maximize the usefulness of robots and
 

875
00:16:43,459 --> 00:16:45,490
of maximize the usefulness of robots and
there the answer might be something like

876
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:45,500
there the answer might be something like
 

877
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:52,630
there the answer might be something like
a system where a system that can perform

00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,850
you know within the physical constraints
of course if you tell it to teleport to

884
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:00,860
of course if you tell it to teleport to
 

885
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,050
of course if you tell it to teleport to
another planet but probably can't do

886
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:02,060
another planet but probably can't do
 

887
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,670
another planet but probably can't do
that but if you if you ask it to do

888
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:03,680
that but if you if you ask it to do
 

889
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,659
that but if you if you ask it to do
something that's within its physical

890
00:17:04,659 --> 00:17:04,669
something that's within its physical
 

891
00:17:04,669 --> 00:17:06,640
something that's within its physical
capability then potentially with a

892
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:06,650
capability then potentially with a
 

893
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,530
capability then potentially with a
little bit of additional training or a

894
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:08,540
little bit of additional training or a
 

895
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,059
little bit of additional training or a
little bit of additional trial and error

896
00:17:10,059 --> 00:17:10,069
little bit of additional trial and error
 

897
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:11,949
little bit of additional trial and error
it ought to be able to figure it out in

898
00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:11,959
it ought to be able to figure it out in
 

899
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:13,480
it ought to be able to figure it out in
much the same way as like a human tele

900
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:13,490
much the same way as like a human tele
 

901
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,400
much the same way as like a human tele
operator ought to figure out how to

902
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:15,410
operator ought to figure out how to
 

903
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:16,990
operator ought to figure out how to
drive the robot to do that that's kind

904
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:17,000
drive the robot to do that that's kind
 

905
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,020
drive the robot to do that that's kind
of a very pragmatic view of what it

906
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:20,030
of a very pragmatic view of what it
 

907
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:22,150
of a very pragmatic view of what it
would take to kind of solve the the

908
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:22,160
would take to kind of solve the the
 

909
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,090
would take to kind of solve the the
robotics problem if you will but I think

910
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:25,100
robotics problem if you will but I think
 

911
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,159
robotics problem if you will but I think
that there is a second answer and that

912
00:17:27,159 --> 00:17:27,169
that there is a second answer and that
 

913
00:17:27,169 --> 00:17:28,840
that there is a second answer and that
answer that the answer is a lot closer

914
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:28,850
answer that the answer is a lot closer
 

915
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:30,280
answer that the answer is a lot closer
to why I want to work on on robotics

916
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:30,290
to why I want to work on on robotics
 

917
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:32,440
to why I want to work on on robotics
which is that I think it's it's less

918
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:32,450
which is that I think it's it's less
 

919
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:34,630
which is that I think it's it's less
about what it would take to do a really

920
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:34,640
about what it would take to do a really
 

921
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,920
about what it would take to do a really
good job

922
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:35,930
good job
 

923
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,360
good job
in the world of robotics but more the

924
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:37,370
in the world of robotics but more the
 

925
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:39,550
in the world of robotics but more the
other way around what robotics can bring

926
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:39,560
other way around what robotics can bring
 

927
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,180
other way around what robotics can bring
to the table

928
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:40,190
to the table
 

929
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:42,400
to the table
to help us understand artificial

930
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:42,410
to help us understand artificial
 

931
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:46,150
to help us understand artificial
intelligence so your dream fundamentally

932
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:46,160
intelligence so your dream fundamentally
 

933
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,690
intelligence so your dream fundamentally
is to understand intelligence yes I

934
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:49,700
is to understand intelligence yes I
 

935
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,920
is to understand intelligence yes I
think that's the dream for many people

936
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:50,930
think that's the dream for many people
 

937
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:53,770
think that's the dream for many people
who actually work in this space I think

938
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:53,780
who actually work in this space I think
 

939
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,750
who actually work in this space I think
that there is there's something very

940
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:55,760
that there is there's something very
 

941
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,030
that there is there's something very
pragmatic and very useful about studying

942
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:58,040
pragmatic and very useful about studying
 

943
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,560
pragmatic and very useful about studying
robotics but I do think that a lot of

944
00:17:59,560 --> 00:17:59,570
robotics but I do think that a lot of
 

945
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:01,530
robotics but I do think that a lot of
people that go into this field actually

946
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:01,540
people that go into this field actually
 

947
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,340
people that go into this field actually
you know the things that they draw

948
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:03,350
you know the things that they draw
 

949
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:06,190
you know the things that they draw
inspiration from are the potential for

950
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:06,200
inspiration from are the potential for
 

951
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,620
inspiration from are the potential for
robots to like help us learn about

952
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:08,630
robots to like help us learn about
 

953
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:11,650
robots to like help us learn about
intelligence and about ourselves that's

954
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:11,660
intelligence and about ourselves that's
 

955
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,510
intelligence and about ourselves that's
that's fascinating that robotics is

956
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:13,520
that's fascinating that robotics is
 

957
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,020
that's fascinating that robotics is
basically the space by which you can get

958
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:17,030
basically the space by which you can get
 

959
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:19,120
basically the space by which you can get
closer to understanding the fundamentals

960
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:19,130
closer to understanding the fundamentals
 

961
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:21,640
closer to understanding the fundamentals
of artificial intelligence so what is it

962
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:21,650
of artificial intelligence so what is it
 

963
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:23,920
of artificial intelligence so what is it
about robotics that's different from

964
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:23,930
about robotics that's different from
 

965
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:25,690
about robotics that's different from
some of the other approaches so if we

966
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:25,700
some of the other approaches so if we
 

967
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,400
some of the other approaches so if we
look at some of the early breakthroughs

968
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:27,410
look at some of the early breakthroughs
 

969
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:29,800
look at some of the early breakthroughs
in deep learning or in the computer

970
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:29,810
in deep learning or in the computer
 

971
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:31,150
in deep learning or in the computer
vision space and the natural language

972
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:31,160
vision space and the natural language
 

973
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,970
vision space and the natural language
processing there was really nice clean

974
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:33,980
processing there was really nice clean
 

975
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,010
processing there was really nice clean
benchmarks that a lot of people competed

976
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:36,020
benchmarks that a lot of people competed
 

977
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,390
benchmarks that a lot of people competed
on and thereby came out with a lot of

978
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:37,400
on and thereby came out with a lot of
 

979
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,920
on and thereby came out with a lot of
building ideas what's the fundamental

980
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:38,930
building ideas what's the fundamental
 

981
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:41,380
building ideas what's the fundamental
difference to you between computer

982
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:41,390
difference to you between computer
 

983
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:43,870
difference to you between computer
vision purely define an image net and

984
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:43,880
vision purely define an image net and
 

985
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,660
vision purely define an image net and
kind of the bigger robotics problem so

986
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:46,670
kind of the bigger robotics problem so
 

987
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:48,640
kind of the bigger robotics problem so
there are a couple of things one is that

988
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:48,650
there are a couple of things one is that
 

989
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:53,440
there are a couple of things one is that
with robotics you kind of have you kinda

990
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:53,450
with robotics you kind of have you kinda
 

991
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:55,150
with robotics you kind of have you kinda
have to take away many of the crutches

992
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:55,160
have to take away many of the crutches
 

993
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:58,120
have to take away many of the crutches
so you have to deal with with both the

994
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:58,130
so you have to deal with with both the
 

995
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:00,370
so you have to deal with with both the
the the particular problems of

996
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:00,380
the the particular problems of
 

997
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,810
the the particular problems of
perception control and so on but you

998
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:01,820
perception control and so on but you
 

999
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:02,860
perception control and so on but you
also have to deal with the integration

1000
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:02,870
also have to deal with the integration
 

1001
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:05,680
also have to deal with the integration
of those things and you know classically

1002
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:05,690
of those things and you know classically
 

1003
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:07,030
of those things and you know classically
we've always thought of the integration

1004
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:07,040
we've always thought of the integration
 

1005
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,370
we've always thought of the integration
as kind of a separate problem so a class

1006
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:09,380
as kind of a separate problem so a class
 

1007
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,140
as kind of a separate problem so a class
a kind of modular engineering approaches

1008
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:11,150
a kind of modular engineering approaches
 

1009
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,850
a kind of modular engineering approaches
that we solve individual subproblems

1010
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:12,860
that we solve individual subproblems
 

1011
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,170
that we solve individual subproblems
then wire them together and then the

1012
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:14,180
then wire them together and then the
 

1013
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:16,690
then wire them together and then the
whole thing works and one of the things

1014
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:16,700
whole thing works and one of the things
 

1015
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:17,980
whole thing works and one of the things
that we've been seeing over the last

1016
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:17,990
that we've been seeing over the last
 

1017
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,890
that we've been seeing over the last
couple of decades is that well maybe

1018
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:19,900
couple of decades is that well maybe
 

1019
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,450
couple of decades is that well maybe
studying the thing as a whole might lead

1020
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:22,460
studying the thing as a whole might lead
 

1021
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,220
studying the thing as a whole might lead
to just like very different solutions

1022
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:24,230
to just like very different solutions
 

1023
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,810
to just like very different solutions
now if we were to study the parts and

1024
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:25,820
now if we were to study the parts and
 

1025
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,580
now if we were to study the parts and
wire them together so the integrative

1026
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:27,590
wire them together so the integrative
 

1027
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:30,820
wire them together so the integrative
nature of robotics research helps us see

1028
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:30,830
nature of robotics research helps us see
 

1029
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:32,440
nature of robotics research helps us see
you know the different perspectives on

1030
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:32,450
you know the different perspectives on
 

1031
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:34,960
you know the different perspectives on
the problem another part of the answer

1032
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:34,970
the problem another part of the answer
 

1033
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:38,890
the problem another part of the answer
is that with robotics it it casts a

1034
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:38,900
is that with robotics it it casts a
 

1035
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,320
is that with robotics it it casts a
certain paradox into very clever relief

1036
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:41,330
certain paradox into very clever relief
 

1037
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:43,690
certain paradox into very clever relief
so this is sometimes referred to as more

1038
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:43,700
so this is sometimes referred to as more
 

1039
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,810
so this is sometimes referred to as more

very easy for people can be very hard
 

1049
00:19:54,269 --> 00:19:58,700
very easy for people can be very hard
for machines so you know integral and

1050
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:58,710
for machines so you know integral and
 

1051
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:00,860
for machines so you know integral and
differential calculus is pretty

00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:00,870
differential calculus is pretty
 

1053
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:02,690
differential calculus is pretty
difficult to learn for people but if you

difficult to learn for people but if you
 

1055
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,180
difficult to learn for people but if you
program a computer do it it can derive

00:20:15,409 --> 00:20:15,419
for a person to do very hard for a robot
 

1067
00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:17,960
for a person to do very hard for a robot
to deal with and sometimes when we see

1068
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:17,970
to deal with and sometimes when we see
 

1069
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:20,539
to deal with and sometimes when we see
such blatant discrepancies that give us

1070
00:20:20,539 --> 00:20:20,549
such blatant discrepancies that give us
 

1071
00:20:20,549 --> 00:20:21,830
such blatant discrepancies that give us
a really strong hint that we're missing

1072
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:21,840
a really strong hint that we're missing
 

1073
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,810
a really strong hint that we're missing
something important so if we really try

1074
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:23,820
something important so if we really try
 

1075
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,730
something important so if we really try
to zero in on those discrepancies we

1076
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:25,740
to zero in on those discrepancies we
 

1077
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,529
to zero in on those discrepancies we
might find that little bit that we're

1078
00:20:27,529 --> 00:20:27,539
might find that little bit that we're
 

1079
00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:28,700
might find that little bit that we're
missing and it's not that we need to

1080
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:28,710
missing and it's not that we need to
 

1081
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:31,490
missing and it's not that we need to
make machines better or worse at math

1082
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:31,500
make machines better or worse at math
 

1083
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,230
make machines better or worse at math
and better at drinking water but just

1084
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:33,240
and better at drinking water but just
 

1085
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,970
and better at drinking water but just
that by studying those discrepancies you

1086
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:34,980
that by studying those discrepancies you
 

1087
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:38,240
that by studying those discrepancies you
might find some new insight so that that

1088
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:38,250
might find some new insight so that that
 

1089
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,279
might find some new insight so that that
could be that could be in any space it

1090
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:40,289
could be that could be in any space it
 

1091
00:20:40,289 --> 00:20:42,320
could be that could be in any space it
doesn't have to be robotics but you're

1092
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:42,330
doesn't have to be robotics but you're
 

1093
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:45,499
doesn't have to be robotics but you're
saying yeah I get it's kind of

1094
00:20:45,499 --> 00:20:45,509
saying yeah I get it's kind of
 

1095
00:20:45,509 --> 00:20:47,269
saying yeah I get it's kind of
interesting that robotics seems to have

1096
00:20:47,269 --> 00:20:47,279
interesting that robotics seems to have
 

1097
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:50,149
interesting that robotics seems to have
a lot of those discrepancies so the the

1098
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:50,159
a lot of those discrepancies so the the
 

1099
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,999
a lot of those discrepancies so the the
the Hans more of a paradox is probably

1100
00:20:52,999 --> 00:20:53,009
the Hans more of a paradox is probably
 

1101
00:20:53,009 --> 00:20:55,639
the Hans more of a paradox is probably
referring to the space of the the

1102
00:20:55,639 --> 00:20:55,649
referring to the space of the the
 

1103
00:20:55,649 --> 00:20:56,919
referring to the space of the the
physical interaction I think you said

1104
00:20:56,919 --> 00:20:56,929
physical interaction I think you said
 

1105
00:20:56,929 --> 00:20:59,629
physical interaction I think you said
object manipulation walking all the kind

1106
00:20:59,629 --> 00:20:59,639
object manipulation walking all the kind
 

1107
00:20:59,639 --> 00:21:02,230
object manipulation walking all the kind
of stuff we do in the physical world

1108
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:02,240
of stuff we do in the physical world
 

1109
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,049
of stuff we do in the physical world
that well how do you make sense if you

1110
00:21:06,049 --> 00:21:06,059
that well how do you make sense if you
 

1111
00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:10,820
that well how do you make sense if you
were to try to disentangle the the

1112
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:10,830
were to try to disentangle the the
 

1113
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:13,759
were to try to disentangle the the
Marwick paradox like why is there such a

1114
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:13,769
Marwick paradox like why is there such a
 

1115
00:21:13,769 --> 00:21:18,139
Marwick paradox like why is there such a
gap in our intuition about it why do you

1116
00:21:18,139 --> 00:21:18,149
gap in our intuition about it why do you
 

1117
00:21:18,149 --> 00:21:20,299
gap in our intuition about it why do you
think manipulating objects is so hard

1118
00:21:20,299 --> 00:21:20,309
think manipulating objects is so hard
 

1119
00:21:20,309 --> 00:21:22,759
think manipulating objects is so hard
from everything you've learned from

1120
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:22,769
from everything you've learned from
 

1121
00:21:22,769 --> 00:21:24,440
from everything you've learned from
applying reinforcement learning in this

1122
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:24,450
applying reinforcement learning in this
 

1123
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:29,060
applying reinforcement learning in this
space yeah I think that one reason is

1124
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:29,070
space yeah I think that one reason is
 

1125
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:32,600
space yeah I think that one reason is
maybe that for many of the problems for

1126
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:32,610
maybe that for many of the problems for
 

1127
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:33,830
maybe that for many of the problems for
many of the other problems that we've

1128
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:33,840
many of the other problems that we've
 

1129
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,320
many of the other problems that we've
studied in AI and computer science and

1130
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:36,330
studied in AI and computer science and
 

1131
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:40,549
studied in AI and computer science and
so on the notion of input/output and

1132
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:40,559
so on the notion of input/output and
 

1133
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,440
so on the notion of input/output and
supervision is much much cleaner so

1134
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:42,450
supervision is much much cleaner so
 

1135
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:44,119
supervision is much much cleaner so
computer vision for example deals with

1136
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:44,129
computer vision for example deals with
 

1137
00:21:44,129 --> 00:21:46,220
computer vision for example deals with
very complex inputs but it's

1138
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:46,230
very complex inputs but it's
 

1139
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:49,279
very complex inputs but it's
comparatively a bit easier at least up

1140
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:49,289
comparatively a bit easier at least up
 

1141
00:21:49,289 --> 00:21:52,129
comparatively a bit easier at least up
to some level of abstraction to cast it

1142
00:21:52,129 --> 00:21:52,139
to some level of abstraction to cast it
 

1143
00:21:52,139 --> 00:21:53,860
to some level of abstraction to cast it
as a very tightly supervised problem

1144
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:53,870
as a very tightly supervised problem
 

1145
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:56,810
as a very tightly supervised problem
it's comparatively much much harder to

1146
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:56,820
it's comparatively much much harder to
 

1147
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,820
it's comparatively much much harder to
cast robotic manipulation as a very

1148
00:21:58,820 --> 00:21:58,830
cast robotic manipulation as a very
 

1149
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:01,249
cast robotic manipulation as a very
tightly supervised problem you can do it

1150
00:22:01,249 --> 00:22:01,259
tightly supervised problem you can do it
 

1151
00:22:01,259 --> 00:22:02,290
tightly supervised problem you can do it
it just doesn't

1152
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:02,300
it just doesn't
 

1153
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,970
it just doesn't
work all that well so you could say that

1154
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:03,980
work all that well so you could say that
 

1155
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:06,100
work all that well so you could say that
well maybe we get a label data set where

1156
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:06,110
well maybe we get a label data set where
 

1157
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:07,810
well maybe we get a label data set where
we know exactly which motor commands to

1158
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:07,820
we know exactly which motor commands to
 

1159
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:10,090
we know exactly which motor commands to
send and then we train on that but for

1160
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:10,100
send and then we train on that but for
 

1161
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,040
send and then we train on that but for
various reasons that's not actually like

1162
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:12,050
various reasons that's not actually like
 

1163
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:14,020
various reasons that's not actually like
such a great solution and it also

1164
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:14,030
such a great solution and it also
 

1165
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:16,060
such a great solution and it also
doesn't seem to be even remotely similar

1166
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:16,070
doesn't seem to be even remotely similar
 

1167
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:17,620
doesn't seem to be even remotely similar
to how people and animals learn to do

1168
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:17,630
to how people and animals learn to do
 

1169
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:19,240
to how people and animals learn to do
things because we're not told by like

1170
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:19,250
things because we're not told by like
 

1171
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:22,300
things because we're not told by like
our parents here is how you fire your

1172
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:22,310
our parents here is how you fire your
 

1173
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:25,090
our parents here is how you fire your
muscles in order to walk we you know we

1174
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:25,100
muscles in order to walk we you know we
 

1175
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,040
muscles in order to walk we you know we
do get some guidance but the really

1176
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:27,050
do get some guidance but the really
 

1177
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:28,510
do get some guidance but the really
low-level detailed stuff we figure out

1178
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:28,520
low-level detailed stuff we figure out
 

1179
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,070
low-level detailed stuff we figure out
most of them our own and that's what you

1180
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:30,080
most of them our own and that's what you
 

1181
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,510
most of them our own and that's what you
mean by tightly coupled that every

1182
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:31,520
mean by tightly coupled that every
 

1183
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,270
mean by tightly coupled that every
single little sub action gets a

1184
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:34,280
single little sub action gets a
 

1185
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,460
single little sub action gets a
supervised signal of whether it's a good

1186
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:36,470
supervised signal of whether it's a good
 

1187
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:38,770
supervised signal of whether it's a good
one or not right so so while in computer

1188
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:38,780
one or not right so so while in computer
 

1189
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:40,330
one or not right so so while in computer
vision you could sort of imagine up to a

1190
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:40,340
vision you could sort of imagine up to a
 

1191
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,830
vision you could sort of imagine up to a
level of abstraction that maybe you know

1192
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:41,840
level of abstraction that maybe you know
 

1193
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,510
level of abstraction that maybe you know
somebody told you this is a car and this

1194
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:43,520
somebody told you this is a car and this
 

1195
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,640
somebody told you this is a car and this
is a cat and this is a dog in motor

1196
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:45,650
is a cat and this is a dog in motor
 

1197
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:47,020
is a cat and this is a dog in motor
control it's very clear that that was

1198
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:47,030
control it's very clear that that was
 

1199
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:50,290
control it's very clear that that was
not the case if we look I said of the

1200
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:50,300
not the case if we look I said of the
 

1201
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:55,660
not the case if we look I said of the
sub spaces of Robotics that again as you

1202
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:55,670
sub spaces of Robotics that again as you
 

1203
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:57,580
sub spaces of Robotics that again as you
said robotics integrates all of them

1204
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:57,590
said robotics integrates all of them
 

1205
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:59,410
said robotics integrates all of them
together and we'll get to see how this

1206
00:22:59,410 --> 00:22:59,420
together and we'll get to see how this
 

1207
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,480
together and we'll get to see how this
beautiful mess into place but so there's

1208
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:01,490
beautiful mess into place but so there's
 

1209
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:04,210
beautiful mess into place but so there's
nevertheless still perception so it's

1210
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:04,220
nevertheless still perception so it's
 

1211
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,920
nevertheless still perception so it's
the the computer vision problem

1212
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:05,930
the the computer vision problem
 

1213
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:08,920
the the computer vision problem
broadly speaking understanding the

1214
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:08,930
broadly speaking understanding the
 

1215
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:11,050
broadly speaking understanding the
environment then there's also maybe you

1216
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:11,060
environment then there's also maybe you
 

1217
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,330
environment then there's also maybe you
can correct me on this kind of

1218
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:12,340
can correct me on this kind of
 

1219
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,800
can correct me on this kind of
categorization of the space then there's

1220
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:14,810
categorization of the space then there's
 

1221
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:18,760
categorization of the space then there's
prediction in trying to anticipate what

1222
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:18,770
prediction in trying to anticipate what
 

1223
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:20,470
prediction in trying to anticipate what
things are going to do into the future

1224
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:20,480
things are going to do into the future
 

1225
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,470
things are going to do into the future
in order for you to be able to act in

1226
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:23,480
in order for you to be able to act in
 

1227
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,920
in order for you to be able to act in
that world and then there's also this

1228
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:25,930
that world and then there's also this
 

1229
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:29,290
that world and then there's also this
game theoretic aspect of how your

1230
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:29,300
game theoretic aspect of how your
 

1231
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:32,080
game theoretic aspect of how your
actions will change the behavior of

1232
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:32,090
actions will change the behavior of
 

1233
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:36,250
actions will change the behavior of
others in this kind of space what and

1234
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:36,260
others in this kind of space what and
 

1235
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,840
others in this kind of space what and
this is bigger than reinforcement

1236
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:37,850
this is bigger than reinforcement
 

1237
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:39,520
this is bigger than reinforcement
learning this is just broadly looking at

1238
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:39,530
learning this is just broadly looking at
 

1239
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:41,230
learning this is just broadly looking at
the problem of Robotics what's the

1240
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:41,240
the problem of Robotics what's the
 

1241
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:44,260
the problem of Robotics what's the
hardest problem here or is there or is

1242
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:44,270
hardest problem here or is there or is
 

1243
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:49,840
hardest problem here or is there or is
what you said true that when you start

1244
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:49,850
what you said true that when you start
 

1245
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:51,430
what you said true that when you start
to look at all of them together that's

1246
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:51,440
to look at all of them together that's
 

1247
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,460
to look at all of them together that's
an int that's a whole nother thing like

1248
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:54,470
an int that's a whole nother thing like
 

1249
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:56,110
an int that's a whole nother thing like
you can't even say which one

1250
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:56,120
you can't even say which one
 

1251
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,000
you can't even say which one
individually is harder because all of

1252
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,010
individually is harder because all of
 

1253
00:23:58,010 --> 00:23:59,770
individually is harder because all of
them together you should only be looking

1254
00:23:59,770 --> 00:23:59,780
them together you should only be looking
 

1255
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:01,900
them together you should only be looking
at them all together I think when you

1256
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:01,910
at them all together I think when you
 

1257
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:03,790
at them all together I think when you
look at them all together some things

1258
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:03,800
look at them all together some things
 

1259
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,470
look at them all together some things
actually become easier and I think

1260
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:05,480
actually become easier and I think
 

1261
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,900
actually become easier and I think
that's actually pretty important so we

1262
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:07,910
that's actually pretty important so we
 

1263
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:12,490
that's actually pretty important so we
had you know back in 2014 we had some

1264
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:12,500
had you know back in 2014 we had some
 

1265
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,920
had you know back in 2014 we had some
work basically our first work on end to

1266
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:14,930
work basically our first work on end to
 

1267
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:15,640
work basically our first work on end to

you know at the time was something that
seemed a little inflammatory and

seemed a little inflammatory and
 

1277
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,510
seemed a little inflammatory and
controversial in the robotics world but

the point that we were actually trying

if you treat them together then if you

if you treat them together then if you
try to separate them and the way that we

try to separate them and the way that we
try to demonstrate this as we picked a

1296
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:42,020
try to demonstrate this as we picked a
 

1297
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,780
try to demonstrate this as we picked a
fairly simple motor control task where a

1298
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:43,790
fairly simple motor control task where a
 

1299
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:46,360
fairly simple motor control task where a
robot had to insert a little red

1300

robot had to insert a little red
 

1301
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:49,750
robot had to insert a little red
trapezoid into a trapezoidal hole and we

1302
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:49,760
trapezoid into a trapezoidal hole and we
 

1303
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,450
trapezoid into a trapezoidal hole and we
had our separated solution which

1304
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:52,460
had our separated solution which
 

1305
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:54,070
had our separated solution which
involved first detecting the hole using

1306
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:54,080
involved first detecting the hole using
 

1307
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,800
involved first detecting the hole using
a pose detector and then actuated arm to

1308
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:56,810
a pose detector and then actuated arm to
 

1309
00:24:56,810 --> 00:24:58,750
a pose detector and then actuated arm to
put it in and then our intent solution

1310
00:24:58,750 --> 00:24:58,760
put it in and then our intent solution
 

1311
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,510
put it in and then our intent solution
which just mapped pixels to the torques

1312
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:00,520
which just mapped pixels to the torques
 

1313
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:03,490
which just mapped pixels to the torques
and one of the things we observed is

1314
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:03,500
and one of the things we observed is
 

1315
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,290
and one of the things we observed is
that if you use the intense solution

1316
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:05,300
that if you use the intense solution
 

1317
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,520
that if you use the intense solution
essentially the pressure on the

1318
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:06,530
essentially the pressure on the
 

1319
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:07,690
essentially the pressure on the
perception part of the model is actually

1320
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:07,700
perception part of the model is actually
 

1321
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,250
perception part of the model is actually
lower like it doesn't have to figure out

1322
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:09,260
lower like it doesn't have to figure out
 

1323
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,720
lower like it doesn't have to figure out
exactly where the thing is in 3d space

1324
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:10,730
exactly where the thing is in 3d space
 

1325
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:13,990
exactly where the thing is in 3d space
it just needs to figure out where it is

1326
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:14,000
it just needs to figure out where it is
 

1327
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,310
it just needs to figure out where it is
you know distributing the errors in such

1328
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:15,320
you know distributing the errors in such
 

1329
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,260
you know distributing the errors in such
a way that the horizontal difference

1330
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:17,270
a way that the horizontal difference
 

1331
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:18,040
a way that the horizontal difference
matters more than the vertical

1332
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:18,050
matters more than the vertical
 

1333
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:19,330
matters more than the vertical
difference because vertically just

1334
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:19,340
difference because vertically just
 

1335
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,740
difference because vertically just
pushes it down all the way until it

1336
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:20,750
pushes it down all the way until it
 

1337
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,600
pushes it down all the way until it
can't go any further and their

1338
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:22,610
can't go any further and their
 

1339
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:24,370
can't go any further and their
perceptual errors are a lot less harmful

1340
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:24,380
perceptual errors are a lot less harmful
 

1341
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:26,290
perceptual errors are a lot less harmful
whereas a perpendicular to the direction

1342
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:26,300
whereas a perpendicular to the direction
 

1343
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,760
whereas a perpendicular to the direction
of motion perceptual errors are much

1344
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:27,770
of motion perceptual errors are much
 

1345
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:30,760
of motion perceptual errors are much
more harmful so the point is that if you

1346
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:30,770
more harmful so the point is that if you
 

1347
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:32,590
more harmful so the point is that if you
combine these two things you can trade

1348
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:32,600
combine these two things you can trade
 

1349
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,920
combine these two things you can trade
off errors between the components

1350
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:34,930
off errors between the components
 

1351
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:37,510
off errors between the components
optimally to best accomplish the task

1352
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:37,520
optimally to best accomplish the task
 

1353
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,340
optimally to best accomplish the task
and the components can should be weaker

1354
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:39,350
and the components can should be weaker
 

1355
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:40,930
and the components can should be weaker
while still leading to better overall

1356
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:40,940
while still leading to better overall
 

1357
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:44,530
while still leading to better overall

1359
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:46,900

in the space of pegs and things like

1360
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:46,910
in the space of pegs and things like
 

1361
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:49,390
in the space of pegs and things like
that is quite simple it almost is

1362
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:49,400
that is quite simple it almost is
 

1363
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:53,560
that is quite simple it almost is
tempting to overlook but that's seems to

1364
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:53,570
tempting to overlook but that's seems to
 

1365
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:55,120
tempting to overlook but that's seems to
be at least intuitively an idea that

1366
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:55,130
be at least intuitively an idea that
 

1367
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:57,580
be at least intuitively an idea that
should generalize to basically all

that actually happens in nature and I'm
 

1427
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,159
that actually happens in nature and I'm
sure this is just one instance of it

that we were able to identify just

1430
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:56,910
that we were able to identify just
 

1431
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:58,520
that we were able to identify just
because it's you know that scientists

1432
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:58,530
because it's you know that scientists
 

1433
00:26:58,530 --> 00:26:59,570
because it's you know that scientists
are able to identify that goes so

00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:05,610
talk about robotics they have a
 

1441
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:09,110
talk about robotics they have a
canonical problem sort of a simple clean

00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:14,250
robotics they you think about when
 

1447
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:15,230

problems we talked about robotic
 

1451
00:27:17,789 --> 00:27:19,720

manipulation to me that seems

1452
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:19,730
manipulation to me that seems
 

1453
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:23,659

a space that's the canonical problem if
 

1459
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:31,520
a space that's the canonical problem if

I don't think I have like a really great
 

1471
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:47,510
I don't think I have like a really great
answer to that and I think partly the

1472
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:47,520
answer to that and I think partly the
 

1473
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,820
answer to that and I think partly the
reason I don't have a great answer kind

1474
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:49,830
reason I don't have a great answer kind
 

1475
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:53,419
reason I don't have a great answer kind
of has to do with the it has to do with

1476
00:27:53,419 --> 00:27:53,429
of has to do with the it has to do with
 

1477
00:27:53,429 --> 00:27:55,310
of has to do with the it has to do with
the fact that the difficulty is really

1478
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:55,320
the fact that the difficulty is really
 

1479
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,680
the fact that the difficulty is really
in the flexibility and adaptability

1480
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:56,690
in the flexibility and adaptability
 

1481
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:59,570
in the flexibility and adaptability
rather than in doing a particular thing

1482
00:27:59,570 --> 00:27:59,580
rather than in doing a particular thing
 

1483
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:03,470
rather than in doing a particular thing
really really well so it's hard to just

1484
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:03,480
really really well so it's hard to just
 

1485
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,380
really really well so it's hard to just
say like oh if you can I don't know like

1486
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:05,390
say like oh if you can I don't know like

you'll you'll be very proficient it's

1492
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:12,870
you'll you'll be very proficient it's
 

1493
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:15,940
you'll you'll be very proficient it's
really the ability to quickly figure out

00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:15,950
really the ability to quickly figure out
 

1495
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:21,110
really the ability to quickly figure out
how to do some arbitrary new thing well

1496
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:21,120
how to do some arbitrary new thing well
 

1497
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,260
how to do some arbitrary new thing well
enough so like you know to move on to

1498
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:24,270
enough so like you know to move on to
 

1499
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:26,960
enough so like you know to move on to
the next arbitrary thing but the the

1500
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:26,970
the next arbitrary thing but the the
 

1501
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:29,990
the next arbitrary thing but the the
source of newness and uncertainty have

1502
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:30,000
source of newness and uncertainty have
 

1503
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,330

you found problems in which it's easy to

1504
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:34,340
you found problems in which it's easy to
 

1505
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:38,030
you found problems in which it's easy to
generate new noonah sness messes yeah

1506
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:38,040
generate new noonah sness messes yeah
 

1507
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:41,390
generate new noonah sness messes yeah
new types of newness yeah so

1508
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:41,400
new types of newness yeah so
 

1509
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,730
new types of newness yeah so
a few years ago is so if you'd asked me

1510
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:43,740
a few years ago is so if you'd asked me
 

1511
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:46,550
a few years ago is so if you'd asked me
this question around like 2016 maybe I

1512
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:46,560
this question around like 2016 maybe I
 

1513
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,110
this question around like 2016 maybe I
would have probably said that robotic

1514
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:48,120
would have probably said that robotic
 

1515
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,540
would have probably said that robotic
grasping is a really great example of

1516
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:50,550
grasping is a really great example of
 

1517
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:52,760
grasping is a really great example of
that because it's a task with great

1518
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:52,770
that because it's a task with great
 

1519
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:55,490
that because it's a task with great
real-world utility like you will get a

1520
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:55,500
real-world utility like you will get a
 

1521
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,350
real-world utility like you will get a
lot of money if you can do it well when

1522
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:57,360
lot of money if you can do it well when
 

1523
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,510
lot of money if you can do it well when
is the robotic grasping picking up any

1524
00:28:59,510 --> 00:28:59,520
is the robotic grasping picking up any
 

1525
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,990
is the robotic grasping picking up any
object with a robotic hand exactly so

1526
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:03,000
object with a robotic hand exactly so
 

1527
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,220
object with a robotic hand exactly so
you'll get a lot of money if you do it

1528
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:04,230
you'll get a lot of money if you do it
 

1529
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:06,200
you'll get a lot of money if you do it
well because lots of people want to run

1530
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:06,210
well because lots of people want to run
 

1531
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:08,210
well because lots of people want to run
warehouses with robots and it's highly

1532
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:08,220
warehouses with robots and it's highly
 

1533
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,970
warehouses with robots and it's highly
non-trivial because very different

1534
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:10,980
non-trivial because very different
 

1535
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:13,190
non-trivial because very different
objects will require very different

1536
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:13,200
objects will require very different
 

1537
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,800
objects will require very different
grasping strategies but actually since

1538
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:15,810
grasping strategies but actually since
 

1539
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:18,530
grasping strategies but actually since
then people have gotten really good at

1540
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:18,540
then people have gotten really good at
 

1541
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:20,020
then people have gotten really good at
building systems to solve this problem

1542
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:20,030
building systems to solve this problem
 

1543
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:22,340
building systems to solve this problem
as to the point where I'm not actually

1544
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:22,350
as to the point where I'm not actually
 

1545
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:24,820
as to the point where I'm not actually
sure how much more progress we can make

1546
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:24,830
sure how much more progress we can make
 

1547
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:28,570
sure how much more progress we can make
with that as like the main guiding thing

1548
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:28,580
with that as like the main guiding thing
 

1549
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:31,160
with that as like the main guiding thing
but it's kind of interesting to see the

1550
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:31,170
but it's kind of interesting to see the
 

1551
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:32,600
but it's kind of interesting to see the
kind of methods that have what actually

1552
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:32,610
kind of methods that have what actually
 

1553
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:34,210
kind of methods that have what actually
worked well in that space because a

1554
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:34,220
worked well in that space because a
 

1555
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:37,310
worked well in that space because a
robotic grasping classically used to be

1556
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:37,320
robotic grasping classically used to be
 

1557
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,680
robotic grasping classically used to be
regarded very much as kind of an almost

1558
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:39,690
regarded very much as kind of an almost
 

1559
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:42,560
regarded very much as kind of an almost
like a geometry problem so you people

1560
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:42,570
like a geometry problem so you people
 

1561
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:44,660
like a geometry problem so you people
who have studied the history of computer

1562
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:44,670
who have studied the history of computer
 

1563
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:46,850
who have studied the history of computer
vision will find this very familiar that

1564
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:46,860
vision will find this very familiar that
 

1565
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,440
vision will find this very familiar that
it's kind of in the same way that in the

1566
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:48,450
it's kind of in the same way that in the
 

1567
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:49,700
it's kind of in the same way that in the
early days of computer vision people

1568
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:49,710
early days of computer vision people
 

1569
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:50,870
early days of computer vision people
thought of it very much it's like an

1570
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:50,880
thought of it very much it's like an
 

1571
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,120
thought of it very much it's like an
inverse graphics thing in robotic

1572
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:53,130
inverse graphics thing in robotic
 

1573
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:54,590
inverse graphics thing in robotic
grasping people thought of it as an

1574
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:54,600
grasping people thought of it as an
 

1575
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,570
grasping people thought of it as an
inverse physics problem essentially you

1576
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:56,580
inverse physics problem essentially you
 

1577
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:58,850
inverse physics problem essentially you
look at what's in front of you figure

1578
00:29:58,850 --> 00:29:58,860
look at what's in front of you figure
 

1579
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,680
look at what's in front of you figure
out the shapes then use your best

1580
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:00,690
out the shapes then use your best

00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:02,570
out the shapes then use your best
estimate of the laws of physics to

1582
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:02,580
estimate of the laws of physics to
 

1583
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:03,800
estimate of the laws of physics to
figure out where to put your fingers on

1584
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:03,810
figure out where to put your fingers on
 

1585
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:06,290
figure out where to put your fingers on
you pick up the thing and it turns out

1586
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:06,300
you pick up the thing and it turns out
 

1587
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,880
you pick up the thing and it turns out
that what works really well for robotic

1588
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:07,890
that what works really well for robotic
 

1589
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:10,000
that what works really well for robotic
grasping instantiated in many different

1590
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,010
grasping instantiated in many different
 

1591
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:12,470
grasping instantiated in many different
recent works including our own but also

1592
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:12,480
recent works including our own but also
 

1593
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,080
recent works including our own but also
ones from many other labs is to use

1594
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:15,090
ones from many other labs is to use
 

1595
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:17,360
ones from many other labs is to use
learning methods with some combination

1596
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:17,370
learning methods with some combination
 

1597
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:20,300
learning methods with some combination
of either exhaustive simulation or like

1598
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:20,310
of either exhaustive simulation or like
 

1599
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:21,710
of either exhaustive simulation or like
actual real-world trial-and-error and

1600
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:21,720
actual real-world trial-and-error and
 

1601
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,300
actual real-world trial-and-error and
turns out that those things actually

1602
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:23,310
turns out that those things actually
 

1603
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:24,260
turns out that those things actually
work really well and then you don't have

1604
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:24,270
work really well and then you don't have
 

1605
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:26,330
work really well and then you don't have
to worry about solving geometry problems

1606
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:26,340
to worry about solving geometry problems
 

1607
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:31,130
to worry about solving geometry problems
or physics problems so what are just by

1608
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:31,140
or physics problems so what are just by
 

1609
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,810
or physics problems so what are just by
the way and the grasping what are the

1610
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:32,820
the way and the grasping what are the
 

1611
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:35,420
the way and the grasping what are the
difficulties that have been worked on so

1612
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:35,430
difficulties that have been worked on so
 

1613
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:37,670
difficulties that have been worked on so
one is like the materials of things

1614
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:37,680
one is like the materials of things
 

1615
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:40,280
one is like the materials of things
maybe occlusions and the perception side

1616
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:40,290
maybe occlusions and the perception side
 

1617
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:42,500
maybe occlusions and the perception side
why is it such a difficult why is

1618
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:42,510
why is it such a difficult why is
 

1619
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:44,390
why is it such a difficult why is
picking stuff up such a difficult

1620
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:44,400
picking stuff up such a difficult
 

1621
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,210
picking stuff up such a difficult
problem yeah it's a difficult problem

1622
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:47,220
problem yeah it's a difficult problem
 

1623
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:50,330
problem yeah it's a difficult problem
because the number of things that you

1624
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:50,340
because the number of things that you
 

1625
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:52,280
because the number of things that you
might have to deal with or the variety

1626
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:52,290
might have to deal with or the variety
 

1627
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:53,120
might have to deal with or the variety
of things that you have to deal with is

1628
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:53,130
of things that you have to deal with is
 

1629
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:54,440
of things that you have to deal with is
extremely large

1630
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:54,450
extremely large
 

1631
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:57,980
extremely large
and oftentimes things that work for one

1632
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:57,990
and oftentimes things that work for one
 

1633
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:59,270
and oftentimes things that work for one
class of objects won't work for other

1634
00:30:59,270 --> 00:30:59,280
class of objects won't work for other
 

1635
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:02,120
class of objects won't work for other
class of objects so if you if you get

1636
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:02,130
class of objects so if you if you get
 

1637
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:04,100
class of objects so if you if you get
really good at picking up boxes and now

1638
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:04,110
really good at picking up boxes and now
 

1639
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:06,640
really good at picking up boxes and now
you have to pick up plastic bags you

1640
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:06,650
you have to pick up plastic bags you
 

1641
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:08,690
you have to pick up plastic bags you
know you just need to employ a very

1642
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:08,700
know you just need to employ a very
 

1643
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,720
know you just need to employ a very
different strategy and there are many

1644
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:11,730
different strategy and there are many
 

1645
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:14,360
different strategy and there are many
properties of objects that are more than

1646
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:14,370
properties of objects that are more than
 

1647
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:15,890
properties of objects that are more than
just their geometry it has to do with

1648
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:15,900
just their geometry it has to do with
 

1649
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:18,320
just their geometry it has to do with
you know the bits that that are easier

1650
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:18,330
you know the bits that that are easier
 

1651
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:19,430
you know the bits that that are easier
to pick up the bits that are hard to

00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:19,440
to pick up the bits that are hard to
 

1653
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,450
to pick up the bits that are hard to
pick up the bits that are more flexible

00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:20,460
pick up the bits that are more flexible
 

1655
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,490
pick up the bits that are more flexible
the bits that will cause the thing to

00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:30,060
things that if you pick them up the
 

1665
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,940
things that if you pick them up the
wrong way they'll fall upside down and

1667
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:34,010
wrong way they'll fall upside down and
the contents will spill out so there's

the contents will spill out so there's
 

1669
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,200
the contents will spill out so there's
all these little details that come up

all these little details that come up
 

1671
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:38,360
all these little details that come up
but the task is still kind of can be

but the task is still kind of can be
 

1673
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:39,920
but the task is still kind of can be
characterized as one task like there's a

very clear notion of you did it or you
 

1677
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:45,980

1679
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:48,650
didn't do it so in terms of spilling
things there creeps in this notion that

00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:48,660
things there creeps in this notion that
 

1681
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:51,470
things there creeps in this notion that

1706
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:28,890
general robotics problem so I'm gonna
 

1707
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:30,500
general robotics problem so I'm gonna
slightly dodge that question and say

1708
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:30,510
slightly dodge that question and say
 

1709
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:32,420
slightly dodge that question and say
that I think I think maybe actually it's

the other way around is that studying

1712
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:34,860
the other way around is that studying
 

1713
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:37,280
the other way around is that studying
robotics can help us understand how to

1714
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:37,290
robotics can help us understand how to
 

1715
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:40,640
robotics can help us understand how to
put common sense into our AI systems one

1716
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:40,650
put common sense into our AI systems one
 

1717
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:42,280
put common sense into our AI systems one
way to think about common sense is that

1718
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:42,290
way to think about common sense is that
 

1719
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:44,690
way to think about common sense is that
and and why our current systems might

1720
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:44,700
and and why our current systems might
 

1721
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:45,950
and and why our current systems might
lack common sense is that common sense

1722
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:45,960
lack common sense is that common sense
 

1723
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:49,510
lack common sense is that common sense
is a property is an emergent property of

1724
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:49,520
is a property is an emergent property of
 

1725
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,740
is a property is an emergent property of
actually having to interact with a

1726
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:51,750
actually having to interact with a
 

1727
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:53,900
actually having to interact with a
particular world a particular universe

1728
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:53,910
particular world a particular universe
 

1729
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:56,180
particular world a particular universe
and get things done in that universe so

1730
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:56,190
and get things done in that universe so
 

1731
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:58,070
and get things done in that universe so
you might think that for instance like a

1732
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:58,080
you might think that for instance like a
 

1733
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,190
you might think that for instance like a
an image captioning system maybe it

1734
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:01,200
an image captioning system maybe it
 

1735
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,130
an image captioning system maybe it
looks at pictures of the world and it

1736
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:04,140
looks at pictures of the world and it
 

1737
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:06,260
looks at pictures of the world and it
types out English sentences so it kind

1738
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:06,270
types out English sentences so it kind
 

1739
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:08,120
types out English sentences so it kind
of it kind of deals with our world

1740
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:08,130
of it kind of deals with our world
 

1741
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:10,340
of it kind of deals with our world
and then you can easily construct

1742
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:10,350
and then you can easily construct
 

1743
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:11,810
and then you can easily construct
situations where image captioning

1744
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:11,820
situations where image captioning
 

1745
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,550
situations where image captioning
systems do things that defy common sense

1746
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:13,560
systems do things that defy common sense
 

1747
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,200
systems do things that defy common sense
like give it a picture of a person

1748
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:15,210
like give it a picture of a person
 

1749
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:16,730
like give it a picture of a person
wearing fur coat and we'll say it's a

1750
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:16,740
wearing fur coat and we'll say it's a
 

1751
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:19,130
wearing fur coat and we'll say it's a
teddy bear but I think what's really

1752
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:19,140
teddy bear but I think what's really
 

1753
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:21,590
teddy bear but I think what's really
happening in those settings is that the

1754
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:21,600
happening in those settings is that the
 

1755
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,660
happening in those settings is that the
system doesn't actually live in our

1756
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:23,670
system doesn't actually live in our
 

1757
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:25,280
system doesn't actually live in our
world it lives in its own world that

1758
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:25,290
world it lives in its own world that
 

1759
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:26,900
world it lives in its own world that
consists of pixels and English sentences

1760
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:26,910
consists of pixels and English sentences
 

1761
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:29,750
consists of pixels and English sentences
and doesn't actually consist of like you

1762
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:29,760
and doesn't actually consist of like you
 

1763
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,130
and doesn't actually consist of like you
know having to put on a fur coat in the

1764
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:31,140
know having to put on a fur coat in the
 

1765
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,560
know having to put on a fur coat in the
winter so you don't get cold so perhaps

1766
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:33,570
winter so you don't get cold so perhaps
 

1767
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:35,780
winter so you don't get cold so perhaps
the the reason for the disconnect is

1768
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:35,790
the the reason for the disconnect is
 

1769
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:39,230
the the reason for the disconnect is
that the systems that we have now is

1770
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:39,240
that the systems that we have now is
 

1771
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,850
that the systems that we have now is
simply inhabit a different universe and

1772
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:40,860
simply inhabit a different universe and
 

1773
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,830
simply inhabit a different universe and
if we build AI systems that are forced

1774
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:42,840
if we build AI systems that are forced
 

1775
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,600
if we build AI systems that are forced
to deal with all of the messiness and

1776
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:44,610
to deal with all of the messiness and
 

1777
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:46,910
to deal with all of the messiness and
complexity of our universe maybe they

1778
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:46,920
complexity of our universe maybe they
 

1779
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:49,040
complexity of our universe maybe they
will have to acquire our common sense to

1780
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:49,050
will have to acquire our common sense to
 

1781
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:50,830

1783
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,760

whereas the systems we're building now

1784
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:52,770
whereas the systems we're building now
 

1785
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:54,080
whereas the systems we're building now
don't have to do that they can take some

don't have to do that they can take some
 

1787
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:57,230

the 1960s you'd say oh my robot is doing
optimal control and maybe the difference

1894
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:09,480
optimal control and maybe the difference
 

1895
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,880
optimal control and maybe the difference
between typing out a system of

1896
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:10,890
between typing out a system of
 

1897
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:12,620
between typing out a system of
differential equations and doing

1898
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:12,630
differential equations and doing
 

1899
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:14,990
differential equations and doing
feedback linearization versus training

1900
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:15,000
feedback linearization versus training
 

1901
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,580
feedback linearization versus training
and neural net it's not such a large

1902
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:16,590
and neural net it's not such a large
 

1903
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:18,650
and neural net it's not such a large
difference it's just you know pushing

1904
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:18,660
difference it's just you know pushing
 

1905
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:21,050

to feel like knowledge is supposed to
 

1917
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:39,980
to feel like knowledge is supposed to
optimal control so this feels like

1918
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:39,990
optimal control so this feels like
 

1919
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:41,870
optimal control so this feels like
there's an accumulation of knowledge to

1920
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:41,880
there's an accumulation of knowledge to
 

1921
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,090
there's an accumulation of knowledge to
the learning process yes yeah so I think

1922
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:44,100
the learning process yes yeah so I think
 

1923
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,280
the learning process yes yeah so I think
that is a good point that one big

1924
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:46,290
that is a good point that one big

the more they do something right and I
 

1937
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,540
the more they do something right and I
do think that that's actually a very

do think that that's actually a very
 

1939
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:59,570
do think that that's actually a very
very powerful difference so if you look

1940
00:36:59,570 --> 00:36:59,580
very powerful difference so if you look
 

1941
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:01,670
very powerful difference so if you look
back at the world of expert systems is

1942

we thought that rational decision-making

1978
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:52,690
we thought that rational decision-making
 

1979
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:54,900
we thought that rational decision-making
involves logical manipulation so you

1980
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:54,910
involves logical manipulation so you
 

1981
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:57,480
involves logical manipulation so you
have some model the world expressed in

1982
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:57,490
have some model the world expressed in
 

1983
00:37:57,490 --> 00:38:00,300
have some model the world expressed in
term in terms of logic you have some

order to for X to be true and then you

1988
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:04,930
order to for X to be true and then you
 

1989
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:06,720
order to for X to be true and then you
manipulate your logical symbolic

1990
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:06,730
manipulate your logical symbolic
 

1991
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:08,550
manipulate your logical symbolic

1999
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,630

some there are some things that that we

2052
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:11,080
some there are some things that that we
 

2053
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,450
some there are some things that that we
can think about that make this a little

2054
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:12,460
can think about that make this a little
 

2055
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:14,970
can think about that make this a little
bit more obvious like if I train a big

2056
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:14,980
bit more obvious like if I train a big
 

2057
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:16,800
bit more obvious like if I train a big
neural net model to predict what will

2058
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:16,810
neural net model to predict what will
 

2059
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:18,540
neural net model to predict what will
happen in response to my robots actions

2060
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:18,550
happen in response to my robots actions
 

2061
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:21,420
happen in response to my robots actions
and then I run probablistic inference

2062
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:21,430
and then I run probablistic inference
 

2063
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:23,160
and then I run probablistic inference
meaning I invert that model to figure

2064
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:23,170
meaning I invert that model to figure
 

2065
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:24,240
meaning I invert that model to figure
out the actions that lead to some

2066
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:24,250
out the actions that lead to some
 

2067
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:25,920
out the actions that lead to some
plausible outcome like to me that seems

2068
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:25,930
plausible outcome like to me that seems
 

2069
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:28,410
plausible outcome like to me that seems
like a kind of logic you have a model of

2070
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:28,420
like a kind of logic you have a model of
 

2071
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:29,550
like a kind of logic you have a model of
the world it just happens to be

2072
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:29,560
the world it just happens to be
 

2073
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:32,010
the world it just happens to be
expressed by a neural net and you are

2074
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:32,020
expressed by a neural net and you are
 

2075
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,900
expressed by a neural net and you are
doing some inference procedure some sort

2076
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:33,910
doing some inference procedure some sort
 

2077
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:36,300
doing some inference procedure some sort
of manipulation on that model to figure

2078
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:36,310
of manipulation on that model to figure
 

2079
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:38,670
of manipulation on that model to figure
out you know the answer to a query that

2080
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:38,680
out you know the answer to a query that
 

2081
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:41,130
out you know the answer to a query that
you have it's the interpretability it's

2082
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:41,140
you have it's the interpretability it's
 

2083
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:43,260
you have it's the interpretability it's
the explained ability though that seems

2084
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:43,270
the explained ability though that seems
 

2085
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:45,870
the explained ability though that seems
to be lacking more so because the nice

2086
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:45,880
to be lacking more so because the nice
 

2087
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,230
to be lacking more so because the nice
thing about sort of experts

2088
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:47,240
thing about sort of experts
 

2089
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,359
thing about sort of experts
systems is you can follow the reasoning

2090
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:49,369
systems is you can follow the reasoning
 

2091
00:39:49,369 --> 00:39:52,870
systems is you can follow the reasoning
of the system that to us mere humans is

2092
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:52,880
of the system that to us mere humans is
 

2093
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:56,440
of the system that to us mere humans is
somehow compelling it it would it's just

2094
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:56,450
somehow compelling it it would it's just
 

2095
00:39:56,450 --> 00:40:00,250
somehow compelling it it would it's just
I don't know what to make of this fact

2096
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:00,260
I don't know what to make of this fact
 

2097
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:03,370
I don't know what to make of this fact
that there's a human desire for

2098
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:03,380
that there's a human desire for
 

2099
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:05,670
that there's a human desire for
intelligence systems to be able to

2100
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:05,680
intelligence systems to be able to
 

2101
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:10,690
intelligence systems to be able to
convey in a poetic way to us why made

2102
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:10,700
convey in a poetic way to us why made
 

2103
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,050
convey in a poetic way to us why made
the decisions it did like tell a

2104
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:13,060
the decisions it did like tell a
 

2105
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:17,350
the decisions it did like tell a
convincing story and perhaps that's like

2106
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:17,360
convincing story and perhaps that's like
 

2107
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:21,310
convincing story and perhaps that's like
a silly human thing like we shouldn't

2108
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:21,320
a silly human thing like we shouldn't
 

2109
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,080
a silly human thing like we shouldn't
expect that of intelligent systems like

2110
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:23,090
expect that of intelligent systems like
 

2111
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:25,359
expect that of intelligent systems like
we should be super happy that there is

2112
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:25,369
we should be super happy that there is
 

2113
00:40:25,369 --> 00:40:29,620
we should be super happy that there is
intelligent systems out there but if I

2114
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:29,630
intelligent systems out there but if I
 

2115
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:31,120
intelligent systems out there but if I
were to sort of psychoanalyze the

2116
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:31,130
were to sort of psychoanalyze the
 

2117
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:32,890
were to sort of psychoanalyze the
researchers at the time I would say

2118
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:32,900
researchers at the time I would say
 

2119
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:35,280
researchers at the time I would say
expert systems connected to that part

2120
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:35,290
expert systems connected to that part
 

2121
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:37,990
expert systems connected to that part
that desire for AI researchers for

2122
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:38,000
that desire for AI researchers for
 

2123
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,580
that desire for AI researchers for
systems to be explainable

2124
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:39,590
systems to be explainable
 

2125
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:42,250
systems to be explainable
I mean maybe on that topic do you have a

2126
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:42,260
I mean maybe on that topic do you have a
 

2127
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:45,850
I mean maybe on that topic do you have a
hope that sort of inferences source of

2128
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:45,860
hope that sort of inferences source of
 

2129
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:49,920
hope that sort of inferences source of
learning based systems will be as

2130
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:49,930
learning based systems will be as
 

2131
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:52,660
learning based systems will be as
explainable as the dream was with expert

2132
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:52,670
explainable as the dream was with expert
 

2133
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:55,540
explainable as the dream was with expert
systems for example I think it's a very

2134
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:55,550
systems for example I think it's a very
 

2135
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:57,190
systems for example I think it's a very
complicated question because I think

2136
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:57,200
complicated question because I think
 

2137
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,140
complicated question because I think
that in some ways the question of

2138
00:40:59,140 --> 00:40:59,150
that in some ways the question of
 

2139
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:02,980
that in some ways the question of
explain ability is kind of very closely

2140
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:02,990
explain ability is kind of very closely
 

2141
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:05,530
explain ability is kind of very closely
tied to the question of of like

2142
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:05,540
tied to the question of of like
 

2143
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:08,020
tied to the question of of like
performance like you know why do you

2144
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:08,030
performance like you know why do you
 

2145
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:09,430
performance like you know why do you
want your system to explain itself well

2146
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:09,440
want your system to explain itself well
 

2147
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,750
want your system to explain itself well
so that it's so that when it screws up

2148
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:10,760
so that it's so that when it screws up
 

2149
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,990
so that it's so that when it screws up
you can kind of figure out why it did it

2150
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:13,000
you can kind of figure out why it did it
 

2151
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,400
you can kind of figure out why it did it
right but it's nice but in some ways

2152
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:15,410
right but it's nice but in some ways
 

2153
00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:17,230
right but it's nice but in some ways
that that's a much bigger problem extra

2154
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:17,240
that that's a much bigger problem extra
 

2155
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,630
that that's a much bigger problem extra
like your system might screw up and then

2156
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:19,640
like your system might screw up and then
 

2157
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,370
like your system might screw up and then
it might screw up at how it explains

2158
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:21,380
it might screw up at how it explains
 

2159
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:24,010
it might screw up at how it explains
itself or you might have some bugs

2160
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:24,020
itself or you might have some bugs
 

2161
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:25,690
itself or you might have some bugs
somewhere so that it's not actually

2162
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:25,700
somewhere so that it's not actually
 

2163
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:27,970
somewhere so that it's not actually
doing what was supposed to do so you

2164
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:27,980
doing what was supposed to do so you
 

2165
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:30,070
doing what was supposed to do so you
know maybe a good way to view that

2166
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:30,080
know maybe a good way to view that
 

2167
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,020
know maybe a good way to view that
problem is really as a problem as a

2168
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:32,030
problem is really as a problem as a
 

2169
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:33,820
problem is really as a problem as a
bigger problem of verification and

2170
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:33,830
bigger problem of verification and
 

2171
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:37,330
bigger problem of verification and
validation of which explained abilities

2172
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:37,340
validation of which explained abilities
 

2173
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:40,359
validation of which explained abilities
sort of what one component I see I just

2174
00:41:40,359 --> 00:41:40,369
sort of what one component I see I just
 

2175
00:41:40,369 --> 00:41:42,250
sort of what one component I see I just
see differently I see explained ability

2176
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:42,260
see differently I see explained ability
 

2177
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:44,349
see differently I see explained ability
you you put it beautifully I think you

2178
00:41:44,349 --> 00:41:44,359
you you put it beautifully I think you
 

2179
00:41:44,359 --> 00:41:45,430
you you put it beautifully I think you
actually summarized the field of

2180
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:45,440
actually summarized the field of
 

2181
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,040
actually summarized the field of
explained ability but to me there's

2182
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:48,050
explained ability but to me there's
 

2183
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:49,690
explained ability but to me there's
another aspect of explained ability

2184
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:49,700
another aspect of explained ability
 

2185
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:52,540
another aspect of explained ability
which is like storytelling that has

2186
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:52,550
which is like storytelling that has
 

2187
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:55,670
which is like storytelling that has
nothing to do with errors or with

2188
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:55,680
nothing to do with errors or with
 

2189
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:59,569
nothing to do with errors or with
like the the survey it doesn't it uses

2190
00:41:59,569 --> 00:41:59,579
like the the survey it doesn't it uses
 

2191
00:41:59,579 --> 00:42:03,770
like the the survey it doesn't it uses
errors as as elements of its story as

2192
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:03,780
errors as as elements of its story as
 

2193
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:05,990
errors as as elements of its story as
opposed to a fundamental need to be

00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:06,000
opposed to a fundamental need to be
 

2195
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,420
opposed to a fundamental need to be
explainable when errors occur it's just

2196
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:08,430
explainable when errors occur it's just
 

2197
00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:10,549
explainable when errors occur it's just
that for other intelligence systems to

2198
00:42:10,549 --> 00:42:10,559
that for other intelligence systems to
 

2199
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:12,559
that for other intelligence systems to
be in our world we seem to want to tell

2200
00:42:12,559 --> 00:42:12,569
be in our world we seem to want to tell
 

2201
00:42:12,569 --> 00:42:16,220
be in our world we seem to want to tell
each other stories and that that's true

2202
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:16,230
each other stories and that that's true
 

2203
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:18,230
each other stories and that that's true
in the political world is true in the

2204
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:18,240
in the political world is true in the
 

2205
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,500
in the political world is true in the
academic world and that I you know

2206
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:21,510

works on natural language processing but

2230
00:42:45,890 --> 00:42:45,900
works on natural language processing but
 

2231
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,299
works on natural language processing but
he had this idea to do a little bit of

2232
00:42:47,299 --> 00:42:47,309
he had this idea to do a little bit of
 

2233
00:42:47,309 --> 00:42:49,430
he had this idea to do a little bit of
work in reinforcement learning and how

2234
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:49,440
work in reinforcement learning and how
 

2235
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,710
work in reinforcement learning and how
on how natural language can basically

2236
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:51,720
on how natural language can basically
 

2237
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:54,170
on how natural language can basically
structure the internals of policies

trained with RL and one of the things he

2240
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:57,210
trained with RL and one of the things he
 

2241
00:42:57,210 --> 00:43:00,230
trained with RL and one of the things he
did is he set up a model that attempts

2242
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:00,240
did is he set up a model that attempts
 

2243
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,000
did is he set up a model that attempts
to perform some tasks that's defined by

2244
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:02,010
to perform some tasks that's defined by
 

2245
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:04,670
to perform some tasks that's defined by
a reward function but the model reads in

2246
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:04,680
a reward function but the model reads in
 

2247
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,770
a reward function but the model reads in
a natural language instruction so this

2248
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:06,780
a natural language instruction so this
 

2249
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:07,910
a natural language instruction so this
is a pretty common thing to do in

2250
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:07,920
is a pretty common thing to do in
 

2251
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,620
is a pretty common thing to do in
instruction following so you tell it

2252
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:09,630
instruction following so you tell it
 

2253
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:11,660
instruction following so you tell it
like you know go to the Red House and

2254
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:11,670
like you know go to the Red House and
 

2255
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:13,700
like you know go to the Red House and
then supposed to go to the Red House but

2256
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:13,710
then supposed to go to the Red House but
 

2257
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:15,049
then supposed to go to the Red House but
then one of the things that Jacob did is

2258
00:43:15,049 --> 00:43:15,059
then one of the things that Jacob did is
 

2259
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:17,900
then one of the things that Jacob did is
he treated that sentence not as a

2260
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:17,910
he treated that sentence not as a
 

2261
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:19,819
he treated that sentence not as a
command from a person but as a

2262
00:43:19,819 --> 00:43:19,829
command from a person but as a
 

2263
00:43:19,829 --> 00:43:22,309
command from a person but as a
representation of the internal kind of

2264
00:43:22,309 --> 00:43:22,319
representation of the internal kind of
 

2265
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:25,760
representation of the internal kind of
state of the of the of the mind of this

2266
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:25,770
state of the of the of the mind of this
 

2267
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:27,109
state of the of the of the mind of this
policy essentially so that when it was

2268
00:43:27,109 --> 00:43:27,119
policy essentially so that when it was
 

2269
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:29,089
policy essentially so that when it was
faced with a new task what it would do

2270
00:43:29,089 --> 00:43:29,099
faced with a new task what it would do
 

2271
00:43:29,099 --> 00:43:31,099
faced with a new task what it would do
is it would basically try to think of

2272
00:43:31,099 --> 00:43:31,109
is it would basically try to think of
 

2273
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:33,829
is it would basically try to think of
possible language descriptions attempt

2274
00:43:33,829 --> 00:43:33,839
possible language descriptions attempt
 

2275
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:34,880
possible language descriptions attempt
to do them and see if they led to the

2276
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:34,890
to do them and see if they led to the
 

2277
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:36,200
to do them and see if they led to the
right outcome so it would kind of think

2278
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:36,210
right outcome so it would kind of think
 

2279
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:38,030
right outcome so it would kind of think
out loud like you know I'm faced with

2280
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:38,040
out loud like you know I'm faced with
 

2281
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:39,559
out loud like you know I'm faced with
this new task what am I gonna do let me

2282
00:43:39,559 --> 00:43:39,569
this new task what am I gonna do let me
 

2283
00:43:39,569 --> 00:43:41,000
this new task what am I gonna do let me
go to the red house now that didn't work

2284
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:41,010
go to the red house now that didn't work
 

2285
00:43:41,010 --> 00:43:43,760
go to the red house now that didn't work
let me go to the Blue Room or something

2286
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:43,770
let me go to the Blue Room or something
 

2287
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:45,920
let me go to the Blue Room or something
let me go to the green plant and once it

2288
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:45,930
let me go to the green plant and once it
 

2289
00:43:45,930 --> 00:43:47,120
let me go to the green plant and once it
got some reward it would say oh go to

2290
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:47,130
got some reward it would say oh go to
 

2291
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:48,200
got some reward it would say oh go to
the green plant that's what's working

2292
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:48,210
the green plant that's what's working
 

2293
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:49,730
the green plant that's what's working
I'm gonna go to the green plant and then

2294
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:49,740
I'm gonna go to the green plant and then
 

2295
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:50,690
I'm gonna go to the green plant and then
you could look at the string that it

2296
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:50,700
you could look at the string that it
 

2297
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:51,740
you could look at the string that it
came up with and that was a description

2298
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:51,750
came up with and that was a description
 

2299
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:53,299
came up with and that was a description
of how it thought it should solve the

2300
00:43:53,299 --> 00:43:53,309
of how it thought it should solve the
 

2301
00:43:53,309 --> 00:43:55,430
of how it thought it should solve the
problem so you could do you could

2302
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:55,440
problem so you could do you could
 

2303
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,410
problem so you could do you could
basically incorporate language as

2304
00:43:57,410 --> 00:43:57,420
basically incorporate language as
 

2305
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:59,000
basically incorporate language as
internal state and you can start getting

2306
00:43:59,000 --> 00:43:59,010
internal state and you can start getting
 

2307
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:00,530
internal state and you can start getting
some handle on these kinds of things and

2308
00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:00,540
some handle on these kinds of things and
 

2309
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:03,349
some handle on these kinds of things and
then what I was kind of trying to get to

2310
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:03,359
then what I was kind of trying to get to
 

2311
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:05,420
then what I was kind of trying to get to
is that also if you add to the reward

2312
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:05,430
is that also if you add to the reward
 

2313
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:06,780
is that also if you add to the reward
function

2314
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:06,790
function
 

2315
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:10,380
function
the convincing nough story hmm so I have

2316
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:10,390
the convincing nough story hmm so I have
 

2317
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:13,740
the convincing nough story hmm so I have
another reward signal of like people who

2318
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:13,750
another reward signal of like people who
 

2319
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:15,840
another reward signal of like people who
review that story how much they like it

2320
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:15,850
review that story how much they like it
 

2321
00:44:15,850 --> 00:44:19,950
review that story how much they like it
I says that you you know and initially

00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:19,960
I says that you you know and initially

00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,599
I says that you you know and initially
that could be a hyper parameter or sort

2324
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:21,609
that could be a hyper parameter or sort
 

2325
00:44:21,609 --> 00:44:23,400
that could be a hyper parameter or sort

control so classically reinforcement

2364
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:14,170
control so classically reinforcement
 

2365
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:15,120
control so classically reinforcement
learning has a much more narrow

2366
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:15,130
learning has a much more narrow
 

2367
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:17,070
learning has a much more narrow
definition which is that it's you know

2368
00:45:17,070 --> 00:45:17,080
definition which is that it's you know
 

2369
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,840
definition which is that it's you know
literally learning from reinforcement

2370
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:18,850
literally learning from reinforcement
 

2371
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:20,370
literally learning from reinforcement
like the thing does something and then

2372
00:45:20,370 --> 00:45:20,380
like the thing does something and then
 

2373
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:22,770
like the thing does something and then
it gets a reward or punishment but

2374
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:22,780
it gets a reward or punishment but
 

2375
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:24,030
it gets a reward or punishment but
really i think the way the term is used

2376
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:24,040
really i think the way the term is used
 

2377
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:26,580
really i think the way the term is used
today is it's used for for more broadly

2378
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:26,590
today is it's used for for more broadly
 

2379
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:28,740
today is it's used for for more broadly
to learning based control so some kind

2380
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:28,750
to learning based control so some kind
 

2381
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:29,730
to learning based control so some kind
of system that's supposed to be

2382
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:29,740
of system that's supposed to be
 

2383
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:33,390
of system that's supposed to be
controlling something and it uses data

2384
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:33,400
controlling something and it uses data
 

2385
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,790
controlling something and it uses data
to get better and what is control means

2386
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:35,800
to get better and what is control means
 

2387
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:37,950
to get better and what is control means
is action is the fundamental element

2388
00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:37,960
is action is the fundamental element
 

2389
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:39,859
is action is the fundamental element
yeah it means making rational decisions

2390
00:45:39,859 --> 00:45:39,869
yeah it means making rational decisions
 

2391
00:45:39,869 --> 00:45:42,150
yeah it means making rational decisions
now and rational decisions are decisions

2392
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:42,160
now and rational decisions are decisions
 

2393
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,120
now and rational decisions are decisions
that maximize a measure of utility and

2394
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:44,130
that maximize a measure of utility and
 

2395
00:45:44,130 --> 00:45:47,040
that maximize a measure of utility and
sequentially see many decisions time and

2396
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:47,050
sequentially see many decisions time and
 

2397
00:45:47,050 --> 00:45:50,040
sequentially see many decisions time and
time and time again now like so it's

2398
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:50,050
time and time again now like so it's
 

2399
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:52,530
time and time again now like so it's
easier to see that kind of idea in the

2400
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:52,540
easier to see that kind of idea in the
 

2401
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:55,109
easier to see that kind of idea in the
space of maybe games in the space of

00:45:55,109 --> 00:45:55,119
space of maybe games in the space of

2405
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:59,130

do you see is bigger than that is it

2406
00:45:59,130 --> 00:45:59,140
do you see is bigger than that is it
 

2407
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:01,950
do you see is bigger than that is it

supervised machine learning so the
 

2459
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,330
supervised machine learning so the
reinforcement learning can be viewed as

2460
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:00,340
reinforcement learning can be viewed as
 

2461
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:01,680
reinforcement learning can be viewed as
a generalization of supervised machine

2462
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:01,690
a generalization of supervised machine
 

2463

learning problem you can just say your

2468
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:06,160
learning problem you can just say your
 

2469
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,950

loss function is the negative of your

2470
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:07,960
loss function is the negative of your
 

2471
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:10,170
loss function is the negative of your
reward but you have stronger assumptions

2472
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:10,180
reward but you have stronger assumptions
 

2473
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:11,220
reward but you have stronger assumptions
you have the assumption that someone

2474
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:11,230
you have the assumption that someone
 

2475
00:47:11,230 --> 00:47:12,810
you have the assumption that someone
actually told you what the correct

2476
00:47:12,810 --> 00:47:12,820
actually told you what the correct
 

2477
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:15,810
actually told you what the correct
answer was that your data was iid and so

2478
00:47:15,810 --> 00:47:15,820
answer was that your data was iid and so
 

2479
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:18,060
answer was that your data was iid and so
on so you could view reinforcement

2480
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:18,070
on so you could view reinforcement
 

2481
00:47:18,070 --> 00:47:19,350
on so you could view reinforcement
learning is essentially relaxing some of

2483
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:20,850
learning is essentially relaxing some of
those assumptions now that's not always

00:47:20,850 --> 00:47:20,860
those assumptions now that's not always
 

2485
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:22,110
those assumptions now that's not always
a very productive way to look at it

2486
00:47:22,110 --> 00:47:22,120
a very productive way to look at it
 

2487
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:22,890
a very productive way to look at it
because if you actually have a

00:47:22,890 --> 00:47:22,900
because if you actually have a

00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:24,460
supervised learning problem you'll
 

2491
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:25,950
supervised learning problem you'll
probably solve it much more effectively

2492
00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:25,960
probably solve it much more effectively
 

2493
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:27,330
probably solve it much more effectively
by using supervised learning methods

2494
00:47:27,330 --> 00:47:27,340
by using supervised learning methods
 

2495
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:30,810
by using supervised learning methods
because it's easier but you can view

2496
00:47:30,810 --> 00:47:30,820
because it's easier but you can view
 

2497

00:47:37,290 --> 00:47:37,300
that's a mathematical statement that's
 

2503
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:40,080
that's a mathematical statement that's
absolutely correct but it seems that

2504
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:40,090
absolutely correct but it seems that
 

2505
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:42,270
absolutely correct but it seems that
reinforcement learning the kind of tools

reinforcement learning the kind of tools
 

2507
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:44,160
reinforcement learning the kind of tools
we'll bring to the table today of today

2508
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:44,170
we'll bring to the table today of today
 

2509
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:47,370
we'll bring to the table today of today
so maybe down the line everything will

so maybe down the line everything will
 

2511
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:49,080
so maybe down the line everything will
be a reinforcement learning problem just

be a reinforcement learning problem just
 

2513
00:47:49,090 --> 00:47:49,910
be a reinforcement learning problem just
like you said

image classification should be mapped to
 

2517
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:53,790
image classification should be mapped to

00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:02,170
one of the reasons why it's a bit
 

2575
00:49:02,170 --> 00:49:04,560
one of the reasons why it's a bit
difficult today to use reinforcement

of the settings where we want to do
 

2583
00:49:10,270 --> 00:49:12,540
of the settings where we want to do
rational decision-making it's a little

2584
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:12,550
rational decision-making it's a little
 

2585
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:14,850
rational decision-making it's a little
bit tough to just deploy some policy

2586
00:49:14,850 --> 00:49:14,860
bit tough to just deploy some policy
 

2587
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:17,670
bit tough to just deploy some policy
that does crazy stuff and learns purely

2588
00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:17,680
that does crazy stuff and learns purely
 

2589
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,470
that does crazy stuff and learns purely
through trial and error it's much easier

2590
00:49:19,470 --> 00:49:19,480
through trial and error it's much easier
 

2591
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:21,660
through trial and error it's much easier
to collect a lot of data a lot of logs

2592
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:21,670
to collect a lot of data a lot of logs
 

2593
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:23,730
to collect a lot of data a lot of logs
of some other policy that you've got and

2594
00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:23,740
of some other policy that you've got and
 

2595
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:26,760
of some other policy that you've got and
then maybe you you know if you can get a

2596
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:26,770
then maybe you you know if you can get a
 

2597
00:49:26,770 --> 00:49:28,110
then maybe you you know if you can get a
good policy out of that then you deploy

2598
00:49:28,110 --> 00:49:28,120
good policy out of that then you deploy
 

2599
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:29,430
good policy out of that then you deploy
it and let it kind of fine-tune a little

2600
00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:29,440
it and let it kind of fine-tune a little
 

2601
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:32,100
it and let it kind of fine-tune a little
bit but algorithmically it's quite

2602
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:32,110
bit but algorithmically it's quite
 

2603
00:49:32,110 --> 00:49:33,900
bit but algorithmically it's quite
difficult to do that so I think that

2604
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:33,910
difficult to do that so I think that
 

2605
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:36,150
difficult to do that so I think that
once we figure out how to get

2606
00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:36,160
once we figure out how to get
 

2607
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,500
once we figure out how to get
reinforcement learning to bootstrap

2608
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:37,510
reinforcement learning to bootstrap
 

2609
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:39,930
reinforcement learning to bootstrap
effectively from large data sets then

2610
00:49:39,930 --> 00:49:39,940
effectively from large data sets then
 

2611
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:43,410
effectively from large data sets then
we'll see very very rapid growth and

2612
00:49:43,410 --> 00:49:43,420
we'll see very very rapid growth and
 

2613
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:44,790
we'll see very very rapid growth and
applications of these technologies so

2614
00:49:44,790 --> 00:49:44,800
applications of these technologies so
 

2615
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,290
applications of these technologies so
this is what's referred to as off policy

2616
00:49:46,290 --> 00:49:46,300
this is what's referred to as off policy
 

2617
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:48,630
this is what's referred to as off policy
reinforcement learning or offline RL or

2618
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:48,640
reinforcement learning or offline RL or
 

2619
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:51,060
reinforcement learning or offline RL or
batch RL and I think we're seeing a lot

2620
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:51,070
batch RL and I think we're seeing a lot
 

2621
00:49:51,070 --> 00:49:52,650
batch RL and I think we're seeing a lot
of research right now that that's

2622
00:49:52,650 --> 00:49:52,660
of research right now that that's
 

2623
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:53,760
of research right now that that's
bringing us closer and closer to that

2624
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:53,770
bringing us closer and closer to that
 

2625
00:49:53,770 --> 00:49:56,340
bringing us closer and closer to that
can you maybe paint a picture of the

2626
00:49:56,340 --> 00:49:56,350
can you maybe paint a picture of the
 

2627
00:49:56,350 --> 00:49:57,960
can you maybe paint a picture of the
different methods she said

2628
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:57,970
different methods she said
 

2629
00:49:57,970 --> 00:50:00,650
different methods she said
off policy what's value-based

2630
00:50:00,650 --> 00:50:00,660
off policy what's value-based
 

2631
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:02,490
off policy what's value-based
reinforcement learning what's policy

2632
00:50:02,490 --> 00:50:02,500
reinforcement learning what's policy
 

2633
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:03,990
reinforcement learning what's policy
based was modelled based with soft

2634
00:50:03,990 --> 00:50:04,000
based was modelled based with soft
 

2635
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,880

policy on policy what are the different

2636
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:05,890
policy on policy what are the different
 

2637
00:50:05,890 --> 00:50:08,970
policy on policy what are the different
categories of reinforcement yeah so one

2638
00:50:08,970 --> 00:50:08,980
categories of reinforcement yeah so one
 

2639
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:10,260
categories of reinforcement yeah so one
way we can think about reinforcement

2640
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:10,270
way we can think about reinforcement
 

2641
00:50:10,270 --> 00:50:13,500
way we can think about reinforcement
learning is that it's um it's in some

2642
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:13,510
learning is that it's um it's in some
 

2643
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:17,040
learning is that it's um it's in some
very fundamental way it's about learning

2644
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:17,050
very fundamental way it's about learning
 

2645
00:50:17,050 --> 00:50:19,350
very fundamental way it's about learning
models that can answer kind of what-if

2646
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:19,360
models that can answer kind of what-if
 

2647
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:21,720
models that can answer kind of what-if
questions so what would happen if I take

2648
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:21,730
questions so what would happen if I take
 

2649
00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:23,270
questions so what would happen if I take
this action that I haven't taken before

2650
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:23,280
this action that I haven't taken before
 

2651
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:25,320
this action that I haven't taken before
and you do that of course from

2652
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:25,330
and you do that of course from
 

2653
00:50:25,330 --> 00:50:27,480
and you do that of course from
experience from data and oftentimes you

2654
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:27,490
experience from data and oftentimes you
 

2655
00:50:27,490 --> 00:50:29,550
experience from data and oftentimes you
do it in a loop so you build a model

2656
00:50:29,550 --> 00:50:29,560
do it in a loop so you build a model
 

2657
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:32,010
do it in a loop so you build a model
that answers these what-if questions use

2658
00:50:32,010 --> 00:50:32,020
that answers these what-if questions use
 

2659
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:33,420
that answers these what-if questions use
it to figure out the best action you can

2660
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:33,430
it to figure out the best action you can
 

2661
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:35,130
it to figure out the best action you can
take and then go and try taking that and

2662
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:35,140
take and then go and try taking that and
 

2663
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:36,840
take and then go and try taking that and
see if the outcome agrees with what you

2664
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:36,850
see if the outcome agrees with what you
 

2665
00:50:36,850 --> 00:50:37,910
see if the outcome agrees with what you
predicted

2666
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:37,920
predicted
 

2667
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:41,280
predicted
so the different kinds of techniques are

2668
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:41,290
so the different kinds of techniques are
 

2669
00:50:41,290 --> 00:50:43,020
so the different kinds of techniques are
basically refer different ways of doing

2670
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:43,030
basically refer different ways of doing
 

2671
00:50:43,030 --> 00:50:45,090
basically refer different ways of doing
it so model based methods answer a

2672
00:50:45,090 --> 00:50:45,100
it so model based methods answer a
 

2673
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:46,650
it so model based methods answer a
question of

2674
00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:46,660
question of
 

2675
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:48,780
question of
what state you would get basically what

2676
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:48,790
what state you would get basically what
 

2677
00:50:48,790 --> 00:50:50,040
what state you would get basically what
would happen to the world if you were to

2678
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:50,050
would happen to the world if you were to
 

2679
00:50:50,050 --> 00:50:51,180
would happen to the world if you were to
take a certain action value based

2680
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:51,190
take a certain action value based
 

2681
00:50:51,190 --> 00:50:53,940
take a certain action value based
methods they answer the question of what

2682
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:53,950
methods they answer the question of what
 

2683
00:50:53,950 --> 00:50:55,560
methods they answer the question of what
value you would get meaning what utility

2684
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:55,570
value you would get meaning what utility
 

2685
00:50:55,570 --> 00:50:57,990
value you would get meaning what utility
you would get but in a sense they're not

2686
00:50:57,990 --> 00:50:58,000
you would get but in a sense they're not
 

2687
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,220
you would get but in a sense they're not
really all that different because

2688
00:50:59,220 --> 00:50:59,230
really all that different because
 

2689
00:50:59,230 --> 00:51:01,500
really all that different because
they're both really just answering these

2690
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:01,510
they're both really just answering these
 

2691
00:51:01,510 --> 00:51:04,230
they're both really just answering these
what-if questions now unfortunately for

2692
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:04,240
what-if questions now unfortunately for
 

2693
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,240
what-if questions now unfortunately for
us with current machine learning methods

2694
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:06,250
us with current machine learning methods
 

2695
00:51:06,250 --> 00:51:07,440
us with current machine learning methods
answering what-if questions can be

2696
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:07,450
answering what-if questions can be
 

2697
00:51:07,450 --> 00:51:09,870
answering what-if questions can be
really hard because they are really

2698
00:51:09,870 --> 00:51:09,880
really hard because they are really
 

2699
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:11,370
really hard because they are really
questions about things that didn't

2700
00:51:11,370 --> 00:51:11,380
questions about things that didn't
 

2701
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:13,440
questions about things that didn't
happen if you want to answer what-if

2702
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:13,450
happen if you want to answer what-if
 

2703
00:51:13,450 --> 00:51:14,430
happen if you want to answer what-if
questions about things that did happen

2704
00:51:14,430 --> 00:51:14,440
questions about things that did happen
 

2705
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:15,720
questions about things that did happen
you wouldn't need to learn model you

2706
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:15,730
you wouldn't need to learn model you
 

2707
00:51:15,730 --> 00:51:16,950
you wouldn't need to learn model you
would just like repeat the thing that

2708
00:51:16,950 --> 00:51:16,960
would just like repeat the thing that
 

2709
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:20,760
would just like repeat the thing that
worked before and that's really a big

2710
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:20,770
worked before and that's really a big
 

2711
00:51:20,770 --> 00:51:23,490
worked before and that's really a big
part of why RL is a little bit tough so

2712
00:51:23,490 --> 00:51:23,500
part of why RL is a little bit tough so
 

2713
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:26,490
part of why RL is a little bit tough so
if you have a purely on policy kind of

2714
00:51:26,490 --> 00:51:26,500
if you have a purely on policy kind of
 

2715
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,710
if you have a purely on policy kind of
online process then you ask these

2716
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:28,720
online process then you ask these
 

2717
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,600
online process then you ask these
what-if questions you make some mistakes

2718
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:30,610
what-if questions you make some mistakes
 

2719
00:51:30,610 --> 00:51:32,010
what-if questions you make some mistakes
then you're going to try doing those

2720
00:51:32,010 --> 00:51:32,020
then you're going to try doing those
 

2721
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:33,930
then you're going to try doing those
mistake in things and then you observe

2722
00:51:33,930 --> 00:51:33,940
mistake in things and then you observe
 

2723
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:35,580
mistake in things and then you observe
kind of the counter examples that'll

2724
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:35,590
kind of the counter examples that'll
 

2725
00:51:35,590 --> 00:51:36,780
kind of the counter examples that'll
teach you not to do those things again

2726
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:36,790
teach you not to do those things again
 

2727
00:51:36,790 --> 00:51:39,690
teach you not to do those things again
if you have a bunch of off policy data

2728
00:51:39,690 --> 00:51:39,700
if you have a bunch of off policy data
 

2729
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:41,610
if you have a bunch of off policy data
and you just want to synthesize the best

2730
00:51:41,610 --> 00:51:41,620
and you just want to synthesize the best
 

2731
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:44,130
and you just want to synthesize the best
pulse you can out of that data then you

2732
00:51:44,130 --> 00:51:44,140
pulse you can out of that data then you
 

2733
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:45,510
pulse you can out of that data then you
really have to deal with the the

2734
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:45,520
really have to deal with the the
 

2735
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,220
really have to deal with the the
challenges of making these these

2736
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:47,230
challenges of making these these
 

2737
00:51:47,230 --> 00:51:50,460
challenges of making these these
counterfactual what's the policy yeah a

2738
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:50,470
counterfactual what's the policy yeah a
 

2739
00:51:50,470 --> 00:51:54,390
counterfactual what's the policy yeah a
policy is a model or some kind of

2740
00:51:54,390 --> 00:51:54,400
policy is a model or some kind of
 

2741
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:57,870
policy is a model or some kind of
function that maps from observations of

2742
00:51:57,870 --> 00:51:57,880
function that maps from observations of
 

2743
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:01,290
function that maps from observations of
the world to actions so in reinforcement

2744
00:52:01,290 --> 00:52:01,300
the world to actions so in reinforcement
 

2745
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:04,230
the world to actions so in reinforcement
learning we often refer to the the

2746
00:52:04,230 --> 00:52:04,240
learning we often refer to the the
 

2747
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,460
learning we often refer to the the
current configuration of the world as

2748
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:05,470
current configuration of the world as
 

2749
00:52:05,470 --> 00:52:07,170
current configuration of the world as
the state so we say the state kind of

2750
00:52:07,170 --> 00:52:07,180
the state so we say the state kind of
 

2751
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:08,550
the state so we say the state kind of
encompasses everything you need to fully

2752
00:52:08,550 --> 00:52:08,560
encompasses everything you need to fully
 

2753
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:10,380
encompasses everything you need to fully
define where the world is at at the

2754
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:10,390
define where the world is at at the
 

2755
00:52:10,390 --> 00:52:13,080
define where the world is at at the
moment and depending on how we formulate

2756
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:13,090
moment and depending on how we formulate
 

2757
00:52:13,090 --> 00:52:14,370
moment and depending on how we formulate
the problem we might say you either get

2758
00:52:14,370 --> 00:52:14,380
the problem we might say you either get
 

2759
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:15,960
the problem we might say you either get
to see the state or you get to see an

2760
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:15,970
to see the state or you get to see an
 

2761
00:52:15,970 --> 00:52:18,270
to see the state or you get to see an
observation which is some snapshot some

2762
00:52:18,270 --> 00:52:18,280
observation which is some snapshot some
 

2763
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:21,990
observation which is some snapshot some
piece of the state so policy is just

2764
00:52:21,990 --> 00:52:22,000
piece of the state so policy is just
 

2765
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,390
piece of the state so policy is just
includes everything in it in order to be

2766
00:52:24,390 --> 00:52:24,400
includes everything in it in order to be
 

2767
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,490
includes everything in it in order to be
able to act in this world yes and so

2768
00:52:26,490 --> 00:52:26,500
able to act in this world yes and so
 

2769
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:30,150
able to act in this world yes and so
what is off policy mean if yeah so the

2770
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:30,160
what is off policy mean if yeah so the
 

2771
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,980
what is off policy mean if yeah so the
terms on policy and off policy refer to

2772
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:31,990
terms on policy and off policy refer to
 

2773
00:52:31,990 --> 00:52:34,710
terms on policy and off policy refer to
how you get your data so if you get your

2774
00:52:34,710 --> 00:52:34,720
how you get your data so if you get your
 

2775
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,450
how you get your data so if you get your
data from somebody else who was doing

2776
00:52:36,450 --> 00:52:36,460
data from somebody else who was doing
 

2777
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:37,920
data from somebody else who was doing
some other stuff maybe you get your data

2778
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:37,930
some other stuff maybe you get your data
 

2779
00:52:37,930 --> 00:52:41,580
some other stuff maybe you get your data
from some manually programmed a system

2780
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:41,590
from some manually programmed a system
 

2781
00:52:41,590 --> 00:52:43,620
from some manually programmed a system
that was you know just running in the

2782
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:43,630
that was you know just running in the
 

2783
00:52:43,630 --> 00:52:45,300
that was you know just running in the
world before that's referred to as off

2784
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:45,310
world before that's referred to as off
 

2785
00:52:45,310 --> 00:52:47,550
world before that's referred to as off
policy data but if you got the data by

2786
00:52:47,550 --> 00:52:47,560
policy data but if you got the data by
 

2787
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:49,260
policy data but if you got the data by
actually acting in the world based on

2788
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:49,270
actually acting in the world based on
 

2789
00:52:49,270 --> 00:52:50,790
actually acting in the world based on
what your current policy thinks is good

2790
00:52:50,790 --> 00:52:50,800
what your current policy thinks is good
 

2791
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,800
what your current policy thinks is good
we call that on policy data and

2792
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:52,810
we call that on policy data and
 

2793
00:52:52,810 --> 00:52:55,560
we call that on policy data and
obviously on policy data is more useful

2794
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:55,570
obviously on policy data is more useful
 

2795
00:52:55,570 --> 00:52:57,870
obviously on policy data is more useful
to you because if your current policy

2796
00:52:57,870 --> 00:52:57,880
to you because if your current policy
 

2797
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:59,680
to you because if your current policy
makes some bad decisions you will I

2798
00:52:59,680 --> 00:52:59,690
makes some bad decisions you will I
 

2799
00:52:59,690 --> 00:53:01,390
makes some bad decisions you will I
you see that those decisions are bad off

2800
00:53:01,390 --> 00:53:01,400
you see that those decisions are bad off
 

2801
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:03,160
you see that those decisions are bad off
policy data however might be much easier

2802
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:03,170
policy data however might be much easier
 

2803
00:53:03,170 --> 00:53:05,680
policy data however might be much easier
to obtain because maybe that's all the

2804
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:05,690
to obtain because maybe that's all the
 

2805
00:53:05,690 --> 00:53:08,859
to obtain because maybe that's all the
log data that you have from before so we

2806
00:53:08,859 --> 00:53:08,869
log data that you have from before so we
 

2807
00:53:08,869 --> 00:53:11,370
log data that you have from before so we
talked about new offline talked about

2808
00:53:11,370 --> 00:53:11,380
talked about new offline talked about
 

2809
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:14,020
talked about new offline talked about
autonomous vehicles so you can envision

2810
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:14,030
autonomous vehicles so you can envision
 

2811
00:53:14,030 --> 00:53:15,990
autonomous vehicles so you can envision
off policy kind of approaches in

2812
00:53:15,990 --> 00:53:16,000
off policy kind of approaches in
 

2813
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,609
off policy kind of approaches in
robotics phases where there's really ton

2814
00:53:18,609 --> 00:53:18,619
robotics phases where there's really ton
 

2815
00:53:18,619 --> 00:53:20,200
robotics phases where there's really ton
of robots out there but they don't get

2816
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:20,210
of robots out there but they don't get
 

2817
00:53:20,210 --> 00:53:22,690
of robots out there but they don't get
the luxury of being able to explore

2818
00:53:22,690 --> 00:53:22,700
the luxury of being able to explore
 

2819
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:24,940
the luxury of being able to explore
based on reinforcement learning

2820
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:24,950
based on reinforcement learning
 

2821
00:53:24,950 --> 00:53:28,660
based on reinforcement learning
framework so how do we make again open

2822
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:28,670
framework so how do we make again open
 

2823
00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:30,430
framework so how do we make again open
question but how do we make our policy

2824
00:53:30,430 --> 00:53:30,440
question but how do we make our policy
 

2825
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:34,000
question but how do we make our policy
methods work yeah so this is something

2826
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:34,010
methods work yeah so this is something
 

2827
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:36,099
methods work yeah so this is something
that has been kind of a big open problem

2828
00:53:36,099 --> 00:53:36,109
that has been kind of a big open problem
 

2829
00:53:36,109 --> 00:53:38,400
that has been kind of a big open problem
for a while and in the last few years

2830
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:38,410
for a while and in the last few years
 

2831
00:53:38,410 --> 00:53:40,180
for a while and in the last few years
people have made a little bit of

2832
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:40,190
people have made a little bit of
 

2833
00:53:40,190 --> 00:53:42,430
people have made a little bit of

00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:44,079
progress on that you know I can tell you
about and it's not by any means solved

about and it's not by any means solved
 

2837
00:53:44,089 --> 00:53:45,160
about and it's not by any means solved
yet but I can tell you some of the

00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:45,170
yet but I can tell you some of the
 

2839
00:53:45,170 --> 00:53:46,809
yet but I can tell you some of the
things that for example we've done to

2840
00:53:46,809 --> 00:53:46,819
things that for example we've done to
 

2841
00:53:46,819 --> 00:53:49,690
things that for example we've done to
try to address some of the challenges it

try to address some of the challenges it
 

2843
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:51,160
try to address some of the challenges it
turns out that one really big challenge

2844
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:51,170
turns out that one really big challenge

00:53:51,170 --> 00:53:53,349
turns out that one really big challenge

00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:58,870
is that you can't really trust your

00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:22,420
question right now and you know this is
something that I think it's great

because now arounds question is you know
 

2929
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:26,710
because now arounds question is you know
that that just takes some very smart

that's why I'm pretty excited about that
 

2941
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:37,990
that's why I'm pretty excited about that

well you're really dealing with the

2958
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:53,090
well you're really dealing with the
 

2959
00:55:53,090 --> 00:55:55,120
well you're really dealing with the
situations where you have a model a

seen before
and if it's a if it's a model it's

2968
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:02,150
and if it's a if it's a model it's

00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:17,740
or on the other hand you could try to
make it generalize better somehow or

make it generalize better somehow or
 

2987
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:21,010

00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:25,900
some combination of the two is there
room for mixing sort of or most of it

2990
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:25,910
room for mixing sort of or most of it
 

2991
00:56:25,910 --> 00:56:29,680
room for mixing sort of or most of it
like 90 95 percent is off policy you

2992
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:29,690
like 90 95 percent is off policy you
 

2993
00:56:29,690 --> 00:56:31,690
like 90 95 percent is off policy you
already have the data set and then you

2994
00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:31,700
already have the data set and then you
 

2995
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:34,660
already have the data set and then you
get to send the robot out to do a little

2996
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:34,670
get to send the robot out to do a little
 

2997
00:56:34,670 --> 00:56:36,910
get to send the robot out to do a little
exploration like what what's that role

2998
00:56:36,910 --> 00:56:36,920
exploration like what what's that role
 

2999
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:39,400
exploration like what what's that role
of mixing them together yeah absolutely

3000
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:39,410
of mixing them together yeah absolutely
 

3001
00:56:39,410 --> 00:56:40,990
of mixing them together yeah absolutely
I think that this is something that you

3002
00:56:40,990 --> 00:56:41,000
I think that this is something that you
 

3003
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,140
I think that this is something that you
actually might describe very well at the

3004
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:44,150
actually might describe very well at the
 

3005
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:45,880
actually might describe very well at the
beginning of the of our discussion when

3006
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:45,890
beginning of the of our discussion when
 

3007
00:56:45,890 --> 00:56:47,650
beginning of the of our discussion when
you talk about the iceberg like this is

3008
00:56:47,650 --> 00:56:47,660
you talk about the iceberg like this is
 

3009
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:49,810
you talk about the iceberg like this is
the iceberg that the 99% of your prior

3010
00:56:49,810 --> 00:56:49,820
the iceberg that the 99% of your prior
 

3011
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:51,910
the iceberg that the 99% of your prior
experience that's your iceberg you'd use

3012
00:56:51,910 --> 00:56:51,920
experience that's your iceberg you'd use
 

3013
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:53,410
experience that's your iceberg you'd use
that for all policy reinforcement

3014
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:53,420
that for all policy reinforcement
 

3015
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:55,420
that for all policy reinforcement
learning and then of course if you've

3016
00:56:55,420 --> 00:56:55,430
learning and then of course if you've
 

3017
00:56:55,430 --> 00:56:58,000
learning and then of course if you've
never you know opened that particular

3018
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:58,010
never you know opened that particular
 

3019
00:56:58,010 --> 00:56:59,470
never you know opened that particular
kind of door with that particular lock

3020
00:56:59,470 --> 00:56:59,480
kind of door with that particular lock
 

3021
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:01,180
kind of door with that particular lock
before then you have to go out and

3022
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:01,190
before then you have to go out and
 

3023
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:02,290
before then you have to go out and
fiddle with it a little bit and that's

3024
00:57:02,290 --> 00:57:02,300
fiddle with it a little bit and that's
 

3025
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:04,300
fiddle with it a little bit and that's
that additional 1% to help you figure

3026
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:04,310
that additional 1% to help you figure
 

3027
00:57:04,310 --> 00:57:05,710
that additional 1% to help you figure
out a new task and I think that's

3028
00:57:05,710 --> 00:57:05,720
out a new task and I think that's
 

3029
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:07,540
out a new task and I think that's
actually like a pretty good recipe going

3030
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:07,550
actually like a pretty good recipe going
 

3031
00:57:07,550 --> 00:57:10,200
actually like a pretty good recipe going
forward is this to you the most exciting

space of reinforcement learning now or

space of reinforcement learning now or
 

3035
00:57:12,830 --> 00:57:15,250

is there what's uh and maybe taking a
 

3037
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:18,040
is there what's uh and maybe taking a
step back not just now but what's to use

3038
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:18,050
step back not just now but what's to use
 

3039
00:57:18,050 --> 00:57:20,800
step back not just now but what's to use
the most beautiful idea apologize for

00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:20,810
the most beautiful idea apologize for
 

3041
00:57:20,810 --> 00:57:22,360
the most beautiful idea apologize for
the romanticized question but the

3042
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:22,370
the romanticized question but the

3047
00:57:26,530 --> 00:57:30,360
reinforcement learning
in general I actually think that one of

00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:30,370
in general I actually think that one of
 

3049
00:57:30,370 --> 00:57:32,040
in general I actually think that one of
the things that is a very beautiful idea

3050
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:32,050
the things that is a very beautiful idea
 

3051
00:57:32,050 --> 00:57:33,780
the things that is a very beautiful idea
in reinforcement learning is just the

3052
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:33,790
in reinforcement learning is just the
 

3053
00:57:33,790 --> 00:57:39,110
in reinforcement learning is just the
idea that you can obtain a near optimal

3054
00:57:39,110 --> 00:57:39,120
idea that you can obtain a near optimal
 

3055
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:41,150
idea that you can obtain a near optimal
controller in your optimal policy

reinforcement learning or you think

3066
00:57:54,330 --> 00:57:54,340
reinforcement learning or you think
 

3067
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:56,040
reinforcement learning or you think
about trial and error learning but from

about trial and error learning but from
 

3069
00:57:56,050 --> 00:57:57,690
about trial and error learning but from
a controls perspective it's a very weird

a pretty arbitrary thing just take these

a pretty arbitrary thing just take these
 

3143
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:25,580
a pretty arbitrary thing just take these
two components and stick them together

but the reason that it's it's something
 

3147
00:59:29,410 --> 00:59:30,870
but the reason that it's it's something
that has become so important in recent

3148
00:59:30,870 --> 00:59:30,880
that has become so important in recent
 

3149
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:35,370
that has become so important in recent
years is that reinforcement learning it

those features so you couldn't just take

3196
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:18,710
those features so you couldn't just take
 

3197
01:00:18,710 --> 01:00:20,920
those features so you couldn't just take
an image and plug it into your logistic

someone had to take that image and
 

3203
01:00:23,810 --> 01:00:25,960

process it using some handwritten code
 

3205

process it using some handwritten code
and then neural nets came along and they

3206
01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:28,190
and then neural nets came along and they
 

3207
01:00:28,190 --> 01:00:29,530
and then neural nets came along and they
could actually learn the features and

3208

could actually learn the features and
 

3209
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:31,570
could actually learn the features and
suddenly we could apply learning

suddenly we could apply learning

01:02:22,039 --> 01:02:22,049
what is your sense of the limits of this

01:02:22,049 --> 01:02:24,370
what is your sense of the limits of this
representation power and the control

3310
01:02:24,370 --> 01:02:24,380
representation power and the control
 

3311
01:02:24,380 --> 01:02:27,920

01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:27,930
context I think that in regard to the
 

3313
01:02:27,930 --> 01:02:32,480
context I think that in regard to the
limits that here I think that one thing

3314
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:32,490
limits that here I think that one thing
 

3315
01:02:32,490 --> 01:02:33,890
limits that here I think that one thing
that makes it a little hard to fully

3316
01:02:33,890 --> 01:02:33,900
that makes it a little hard to fully
 

3317
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:38,150
that makes it a little hard to fully
answer this question is because in

01:02:45,770 --> 01:02:45,780
other bottlenecks so like the reason
 

3325
01:02:45,780 --> 01:02:49,730
other bottlenecks so like the reason
that I can't get my robot to learn how

3333
01:02:57,480 --> 01:02:59,990
net is not big enough it's because when
you try to actually do trial and error

other problems like one problem you run
 

3347
01:03:12,450 --> 01:03:15,920
other problems like one problem you run
into very quickly it'll first sound like

a very pragmatic problem that actually
 

3351
01:03:17,099 --> 01:03:18,530
a very pragmatic problem that actually
turns out to be a pretty deep scientific

dishes with trial and error it'll break

3358
01:03:23,359 --> 01:03:23,369
dishes with trial and error it'll break
 

3359
01:03:23,369 --> 01:03:25,069
dishes with trial and error it'll break
all your dishes and then we'll have no

3360
01:03:25,069 --> 01:03:25,079
all your dishes and then we'll have no
 

3361
01:03:25,079 --> 01:03:27,500
all your dishes and then we'll have no
more dishes to clean now you might think

3362
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:27,510
more dishes to clean now you might think
 

3363
01:03:27,510 --> 01:03:29,059
more dishes to clean now you might think
this is a very practical issue but

3364
01:03:29,059 --> 01:03:29,069
this is a very practical issue but
 

3365
01:03:29,069 --> 01:03:30,440
this is a very practical issue but
there's something to this which is that

3366
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:30,450
there's something to this which is that
 

3367
01:03:30,450 --> 01:03:31,880
there's something to this which is that
if you have a person trying to do this

3368
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:31,890
if you have a person trying to do this
 

3369
01:03:31,890 --> 01:03:33,440
if you have a person trying to do this
you know a person will have some degree

3370
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:33,450
you know a person will have some degree
 

3371
01:03:33,450 --> 01:03:35,089
you know a person will have some degree
of common sense they'll break one dish

3372
01:03:35,089 --> 01:03:35,099
of common sense they'll break one dish
 

3373
01:03:35,099 --> 01:03:36,079
of common sense they'll break one dish
it'll be a little more careful with the

3374
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:36,089
it'll be a little more careful with the
 

3375
01:03:36,089 --> 01:03:38,000
it'll be a little more careful with the
next one and if they break all of them

3376
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:38,010
next one and if they break all of them
 

3377
01:03:38,010 --> 01:03:39,710
next one and if they break all of them
they're gonna go and get more or

3378
01:03:39,710 --> 01:03:39,720
they're gonna go and get more or
 

3379
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:41,720
they're gonna go and get more or
something like that so there's all sorts

3380
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:41,730
something like that so there's all sorts
 

3381
01:03:41,730 --> 01:03:44,839
something like that so there's all sorts
of scaffolding that that comes very

01:03:44,839 --> 01:03:44,849
of scaffolding that that comes very
 

3383
01:03:44,849 --> 01:03:46,250
of scaffolding that that comes very
naturally to us for our learning process

3384
01:03:46,250 --> 01:03:46,260
naturally to us for our learning process
 

3385
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:48,500

01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:25,039
things like this that start to come up
when we think through what we really

need to get reinforcement learning to

01:04:28,109 --> 01:04:29,539
happen at scale in the real world and
any that many of these things actually

any that many of these things actually
 

3433
01:04:29,549 --> 01:04:32,029
any that many of these things actually
suggest a little bit of a shortcoming in

suggest a little bit of a shortcoming in
 

3435
01:04:32,039 --> 01:04:34,400
suggest a little bit of a shortcoming in
the problem formulation and a few deeper

01:04:36,260 --> 01:04:36,270
questions that we have to resolve that's
 

3439
01:04:36,270 --> 01:04:38,089
questions that we have to resolve that's
really interesting I thought to like

01:04:38,089 --> 01:04:38,099
really interesting I thought to like

seems like there's no again the the we
 

3445
01:04:45,210 --> 01:04:48,109
seems like there's no again the the we
haven't hit the limit at all in the

haven't hit the limit at all in the
 

3447
01:04:48,119 --> 01:04:49,760
haven't hit the limit at all in the

so in the game in the case of go you can

3450
01:04:52,460 --> 01:04:52,470
so in the game in the case of go you can
 

3451
01:04:52,470 --> 01:04:54,799
so in the game in the case of go you can
it's really about just scaling compute

01:04:54,799 --> 01:04:54,809
it's really about just scaling compute
 

3453
01:04:54,809 --> 01:04:58,549
it's really about just scaling compute
so again like the bottleneck is the

3454
01:04:58,549 --> 01:04:58,559
so again like the bottleneck is the
 

3455
01:04:58,559 --> 01:04:59,990
so again like the bottleneck is the
amount of money you're willing to invest

3456
01:04:59,990 --> 01:05:00,000
amount of money you're willing to invest

01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,210
amount of money you're willing to invest
in compute and then maybe the different

3458
01:05:02,210 --> 01:05:02,220
in compute and then maybe the different
 

3459
01:05:02,220 --> 01:05:05,180
in compute and then maybe the different
the scaffolding around how difficult it

3460
01:05:05,180 --> 01:05:05,190
the scaffolding around how difficult it
 

3461
01:05:05,190 --> 01:05:07,700
the scaffolding around how difficult it
is to scale compute maybe but there

3462
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:07,710
is to scale compute maybe but there
 

3463
01:05:07,710 --> 01:05:09,650
is to scale compute maybe but there
there's no limit and it's interesting

3464
01:05:09,650 --> 01:05:09,660
there's no limit and it's interesting
 

3465
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:11,359
there's no limit and it's interesting
now we move to the real world and

3466
01:05:11,359 --> 01:05:11,369
now we move to the real world and
 

3467
01:05:11,369 --> 01:05:13,099
now we move to the real world and
there's the broken dishes they solved it

3468
01:05:13,099 --> 01:05:13,109
there's the broken dishes they solved it
 

3469
01:05:13,109 --> 01:05:14,900
there's the broken dishes they solved it
and the reward function like you

3470
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:14,910
and the reward function like you
 

3471
01:05:14,910 --> 01:05:18,260
and the reward function like you
mentioned that's really nice of what how

3472
01:05:18,260 --> 01:05:18,270
mentioned that's really nice of what how
 

3473
01:05:18,270 --> 01:05:20,299
mentioned that's really nice of what how
do we push forward there do you think

3474
01:05:20,299 --> 01:05:20,309
do we push forward there do you think
 

3475
01:05:20,309 --> 01:05:22,910
do we push forward there do you think
there's there's this kind of sample

3476
01:05:22,910 --> 01:05:22,920
there's there's this kind of sample
 

3477
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:25,910
there's there's this kind of sample
efficiency question that people bring up

3478
01:05:25,910 --> 01:05:25,920
efficiency question that people bring up
 

3479
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:28,279
efficiency question that people bring up
or you know not having to break a

3480
01:05:28,279 --> 01:05:28,289
or you know not having to break a
 

3481
01:05:28,289 --> 01:05:31,069
or you know not having to break a
hundred thousand dishes is this an

3482
01:05:31,069 --> 01:05:31,079
hundred thousand dishes is this an
 

3483
01:05:31,079 --> 01:05:34,390
hundred thousand dishes is this an
algorithm question is this data

3484
01:05:34,390 --> 01:05:34,400
algorithm question is this data
 

3485
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:37,819
algorithm question is this data
selection like question or what do you

3486
01:05:37,819 --> 01:05:37,829
selection like question or what do you
 

3487
01:05:37,829 --> 01:05:39,799
selection like question or what do you
think how do we how do we not break them

3488
01:05:39,799 --> 01:05:39,809
think how do we how do we not break them
 

3489
01:05:39,809 --> 01:05:43,609
think how do we how do we not break them
too many dishes yeah well one way we can

3490
01:05:43,609 --> 01:05:43,619
too many dishes yeah well one way we can
 

3491
01:05:43,619 --> 01:05:48,140
too many dishes yeah well one way we can
think about that is that maybe we need

3492
01:05:48,140 --> 01:05:48,150
think about that is that maybe we need
 

3493
01:05:48,150 --> 01:05:51,740
think about that is that maybe we need
to be better at reusing our data

3494
01:05:51,740 --> 01:05:51,750
to be better at reusing our data
 

3495

to be better at reusing our data
building that that iceberg so perhaps

3496
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:54,890
building that that iceberg so perhaps
 

3497
01:05:54,890 --> 01:05:58,430
building that that iceberg so perhaps
perhaps it's too much to hope that you

3498
01:05:58,430 --> 01:05:58,440
perhaps it's too much to hope that you
 

3499
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:02,630
perhaps it's too much to hope that you
can have a machine that in isolation in

01:06:02,630 --> 01:06:02,640
can have a machine that in isolation in

perhaps it also doesn't have to perhaps
 

3509
01:06:09,930 --> 01:06:11,960
perhaps it also doesn't have to perhaps
what it really needs to do is have an

what it really needs to do is have an
 

3511

categories like multitask learning or
 

3525
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:28,089
categories like multitask learning or

meta learning but they all fundamentally
 

3527
01:06:28,099 --> 01:06:30,430

what's your sense like what's the signal

3558
01:07:13,660 --> 01:07:13,670
what's your sense like what's the signal

01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:27,050
that data so I think that actually the
 

3569
01:07:27,050 --> 01:07:29,170
that data so I think that actually the
kind of problems that come up when we

3570
01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:29,180
kind of problems that come up when we
 

3571
01:07:29,180 --> 01:07:33,819
kind of problems that come up when we
want systems that are reliable and that

want systems that are reliable and that
 

3573

similar to the kind of problems that
 

3579
01:07:38,270 --> 01:07:39,730
similar to the kind of problems that

policy reinforcement learning so as I

3582
01:07:41,410 --> 01:07:41,420

3583
01:07:41,420 --> 01:07:42,490

reinforcement learning the big problem

3586
01:07:44,530 --> 01:07:44,540
reinforcement learning the big problem
 

3587
01:07:44,540 --> 01:07:46,900
reinforcement learning the big problem
is you need to know when you can trust

3588
01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:46,910
is you need to know when you can trust
 

3589
01:07:46,910 --> 01:07:48,670
is you need to know when you can trust
the predictions of your model because if

3590
01:07:48,670 --> 01:07:48,680
the predictions of your model because if
 

3591
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:51,130
the predictions of your model because if
you if you're trying to evaluate some

3592
01:07:51,130 --> 01:07:51,140
you if you're trying to evaluate some
 

3593
01:07:51,140 --> 01:07:52,540
you if you're trying to evaluate some
pattern of behavior for which your model

3594
01:07:52,540 --> 01:07:52,550
pattern of behavior for which your model
 

3595
01:07:52,550 --> 01:07:53,440
pattern of behavior for which your model
doesn't give you an accurate prediction

3596
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:53,450
doesn't give you an accurate prediction
 

3597
01:07:53,450 --> 01:07:56,109
doesn't give you an accurate prediction
then you shouldn't use that to to modify

3598
01:07:56,109 --> 01:07:56,119
then you shouldn't use that to to modify
 

3599
01:07:56,119 --> 01:07:57,700
then you shouldn't use that to to modify
your policy and it's actually very

3600
01:07:57,700 --> 01:07:57,710
your policy and it's actually very
 

3601
01:07:57,710 --> 01:07:58,900
your policy and it's actually very
similar to the problem that we're faced

3602
01:07:58,900 --> 01:07:58,910
similar to the problem that we're faced
 

3603
01:07:58,910 --> 01:08:00,700
similar to the problem that we're faced
when we actually then deploy that thing

3604
01:08:00,700 --> 01:08:00,710
when we actually then deploy that thing
 

3605
01:08:00,710 --> 01:08:02,620
when we actually then deploy that thing
and we want to decide whether we trust

3606
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:02,630
and we want to decide whether we trust
 

3607
01:08:02,630 --> 01:08:05,829
and we want to decide whether we trust
it in the moment or not so perhaps we

3608
01:08:05,829 --> 01:08:05,839
it in the moment or not so perhaps we
 

3609
01:08:05,839 --> 01:08:07,150
it in the moment or not so perhaps we
just need to do a better job of figuring

3610
01:08:07,150 --> 01:08:07,160
just need to do a better job of figuring
 

3611
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:08,589
just need to do a better job of figuring
out that part and that's a very deep

3612
01:08:08,589 --> 01:08:08,599
out that part and that's a very deep
 

3613
01:08:08,599 --> 01:08:10,510
out that part and that's a very deep
research question of course it's also a

3614
01:08:10,510 --> 01:08:10,520
research question of course it's also a
 

3615
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:11,260
research question of course it's also a
question that a lot of people are

3616
01:08:11,260 --> 01:08:11,270
question that a lot of people are
 

3617
01:08:11,270 --> 01:08:12,640
question that a lot of people are
working on so I'm pretty optimistic that

3618
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:12,650
working on so I'm pretty optimistic that
 

3619
01:08:12,650 --> 01:08:13,990
working on so I'm pretty optimistic that
we can make some progress on that over

3620
01:08:13,990 --> 01:08:14,000
we can make some progress on that over
 

3621
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,269
we can make some progress on that over
the next few years what's the role of

3622
01:08:16,269 --> 01:08:16,279
the next few years what's the role of
 

3623
01:08:16,279 --> 01:08:18,550
the next few years what's the role of
simulation in reinforcement learning the

3624
01:08:18,550 --> 01:08:18,560
simulation in reinforcement learning the
 

3625
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:19,870

reinforcement learning like how

3628
01:08:21,370 --> 01:08:21,380
reinforcement learning like how
 

3629
01:08:21,380 --> 01:08:24,189
reinforcement learning like how
essential is it it's been essential for

3630
01:08:24,189 --> 01:08:24,199
essential is it it's been essential for
 

3631
01:08:24,199 --> 01:08:26,979
essential is it it's been essential for
the breakthroughs so far for some

3632
01:08:26,979 --> 01:08:26,989
the breakthroughs so far for some
 

3633
01:08:26,989 --> 01:08:28,539
the breakthroughs so far for some
interesting breakthroughs do you think

3634
01:08:28,539 --> 01:08:28,549
interesting breakthroughs do you think
 

3635
01:08:28,549 --> 01:08:32,169
interesting breakthroughs do you think
it's a crutch that we rely on I mean

3636
01:08:32,169 --> 01:08:32,179
it's a crutch that we rely on I mean
 

3637
01:08:32,179 --> 01:08:33,070
it's a crutch that we rely on I mean
again it's can

3638
01:08:33,070 --> 01:08:33,080
again it's can
 

3639
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:36,520
again it's can
throw off policy discussion but do you

3640
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:36,530
throw off policy discussion but do you
 

3641
01:08:36,530 --> 01:08:38,200
throw off policy discussion but do you
think we can ever get rid of simulation

3642
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:38,210
think we can ever get rid of simulation
 

3643
01:08:38,210 --> 01:08:39,490
think we can ever get rid of simulation
or do you think simulation will actually

3644
01:08:39,490 --> 01:08:39,500
or do you think simulation will actually
 

3645
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:40,870
or do you think simulation will actually
take over will create more and more

3646
01:08:40,870 --> 01:08:40,880
take over will create more and more
 

3647
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:42,849
take over will create more and more
realistic simulations that will allow us

3648
01:08:42,849 --> 01:08:42,859
realistic simulations that will allow us
 

3649
01:08:42,859 --> 01:08:46,090
realistic simulations that will allow us
to to solve actual real-world problems

3650
01:08:46,090 --> 01:08:46,100
to to solve actual real-world problems
 

3651
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:47,650
to to solve actual real-world problems
like transfer the models will learn in

3652
01:08:47,650 --> 01:08:47,660
like transfer the models will learn in
 

3653
01:08:47,660 --> 01:08:49,360
like transfer the models will learn in
simulation from the walk-around yes I

3654
01:08:49,360 --> 01:08:49,370
simulation from the walk-around yes I
 

3655
01:08:49,370 --> 01:08:51,520
simulation from the walk-around yes I
think that simulation is a very

3656
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:51,530
think that simulation is a very
 

3657
01:08:51,530 --> 01:08:53,710
think that simulation is a very
pragmatic tool that we can use to get a

3658
01:08:53,710 --> 01:08:53,720
pragmatic tool that we can use to get a
 

3659
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:55,329
pragmatic tool that we can use to get a
lot of useful stuff to work right now

3660
01:08:55,329 --> 01:08:55,339
lot of useful stuff to work right now
 

3661
01:08:55,339 --> 01:08:57,970
lot of useful stuff to work right now
but I think that in the long run we will

3662
01:08:57,970 --> 01:08:57,980
but I think that in the long run we will
 

3663
01:08:57,980 --> 01:09:00,490
but I think that in the long run we will
need to build machines that can learn

3664
01:09:00,490 --> 01:09:00,500
need to build machines that can learn
 

3665
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:02,440
need to build machines that can learn
from real data because that's the only

3666
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:02,450
from real data because that's the only
 

3667
01:09:02,450 --> 01:09:03,400
from real data because that's the only
way that will get them to improve

3668
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:03,410
way that will get them to improve
 

3669
01:09:03,410 --> 01:09:06,730
way that will get them to improve
perpetually because if we can't have our

3670
01:09:06,730 --> 01:09:06,740
perpetually because if we can't have our
 

3671
01:09:06,740 --> 01:09:08,290
perpetually because if we can't have our
machines learn from real data if they

3672
01:09:08,290 --> 01:09:08,300
machines learn from real data if they
 

3673
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:09,340
machines learn from real data if they
have to rely on simulated data

3674
01:09:09,340 --> 01:09:09,350
have to rely on simulated data
 

3675
01:09:09,350 --> 01:09:11,200
have to rely on simulated data
eventually the simulator becomes the

3676
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:11,210
eventually the simulator becomes the
 

3677
01:09:11,210 --> 01:09:13,240
eventually the simulator becomes the
bottleneck in fact this is a general

3678
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:13,250
bottleneck in fact this is a general
 

3679
01:09:13,250 --> 01:09:15,849
bottleneck in fact this is a general
thing if your machine has any bottleneck

3680
01:09:15,849 --> 01:09:15,859
thing if your machine has any bottleneck
 

3681
01:09:15,859 --> 01:09:18,460
thing if your machine has any bottleneck
that is built by humans and that doesn't

01:09:18,460 --> 01:09:18,470
that is built by humans and that doesn't
 

3683
01:09:18,470 --> 01:09:20,950
that is built by humans and that doesn't
improve from data it will eventually be

01:09:20,950 --> 01:09:20,960
improve from data it will eventually be
 

3685
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:23,590
improve from data it will eventually be
the thing that holds it back and if

3686
01:09:23,590 --> 01:09:23,600
the thing that holds it back and if
 

3687
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:24,670
the thing that holds it back and if
you're entirely relying on your

3688
01:09:24,670 --> 01:09:24,680
you're entirely relying on your
 

3689
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:25,930
you're entirely relying on your
simulator that'll be the bottleneck if

3690
01:09:25,930 --> 01:09:25,940
simulator that'll be the bottleneck if
 

3691
01:09:25,940 --> 01:09:27,280
simulator that'll be the bottleneck if
you're entirely really reliant on a

you're entirely really reliant on a
 

3693
01:09:27,290 --> 01:09:28,960
you're entirely really reliant on a
manually designed controller that's

3694
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:28,970
manually designed controller that's
 

3695
01:09:28,970 --> 01:09:31,450
manually designed controller that's
going to be the bottleneck so simulation

3696
01:09:31,450 --> 01:09:31,460
going to be the bottleneck so simulation
 

3697
01:09:31,460 --> 01:09:33,880
going to be the bottleneck so simulation
is very useful it's very pragmatic but

3698
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:33,890
is very useful it's very pragmatic but
 

3699
01:09:33,890 --> 01:09:36,010
is very useful it's very pragmatic but
it's not a substitute for being able to

01:09:36,010 --> 01:09:36,020
it's not a substitute for being able to
 

3701
01:09:36,020 --> 01:09:40,480
it's not a substitute for being able to
utilize real experience and this is by

utilize real experience and this is by

01:09:40,490 --> 01:09:41,560
utilize real experience and this is by

the way this is something that I think
 

3705
01:09:41,570 --> 01:09:44,140
the way this is something that I think
is quite relevant now especially in the

3706
01:09:44,140 --> 01:09:44,150
is quite relevant now especially in the
 

3707
01:09:44,150 --> 01:09:45,670
is quite relevant now especially in the
context of some of the things we've

3708
01:09:45,670 --> 01:09:45,680
context of some of the things we've
 

3709
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:47,950
context of some of the things we've
discussed because some of these kind of

3710
01:09:47,950 --> 01:09:47,960
discussed because some of these kind of
 

3711
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:49,270
discussed because some of these kind of
scaffolding issues that I mentioned

3712
01:09:49,270 --> 01:09:49,280
scaffolding issues that I mentioned
 

3713
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:50,920
scaffolding issues that I mentioned
things like the broken dishes and the

3714
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:50,930
things like the broken dishes and the
 

3715
01:09:50,930 --> 01:09:52,120
things like the broken dishes and the
unknown reward function like these are

3716
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:52,130
unknown reward function like these are
 

3717
01:09:52,130 --> 01:09:54,400
unknown reward function like these are
not problems that you would ever stumble

3718
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:54,410
not problems that you would ever stumble
 

3719
01:09:54,410 --> 01:09:57,550
not problems that you would ever stumble
on when working in a purely simulated

3720
01:09:57,550 --> 01:09:57,560
on when working in a purely simulated
 

3721
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:59,320
on when working in a purely simulated
kind of environment but they become very

3722
01:09:59,320 --> 01:09:59,330
kind of environment but they become very
 

3723
01:09:59,330 --> 01:10:00,550
kind of environment but they become very
apparent when we try to actually run

3724
01:10:00,550 --> 01:10:00,560
apparent when we try to actually run
 

3725
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:03,340
apparent when we try to actually run
these things in the real world do you

3726
01:10:03,340 --> 01:10:03,350
these things in the real world do you
 

3727
01:10:03,350 --> 01:10:05,020
these things in the real world do you
throw a brief wrench into our discussion

3728
01:10:05,020 --> 01:10:05,030
throw a brief wrench into our discussion
 

3729
01:10:05,030 --> 01:10:06,490
throw a brief wrench into our discussion
let me ask do you think we're living in

3730
01:10:06,490 --> 01:10:06,500
let me ask do you think we're living in
 

3731
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:10,030
let me ask do you think we're living in
a simulation oh I have no idea do you

3732
01:10:10,030 --> 01:10:10,040
a simulation oh I have no idea do you
 

3733
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:11,860
a simulation oh I have no idea do you
think that's a useful thing to even

3734
01:10:11,860 --> 01:10:11,870
think that's a useful thing to even
 

3735
01:10:11,870 --> 01:10:14,710
think that's a useful thing to even
think about about the there the the

3736
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:14,720
think about about the there the the
 

3737
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:18,720
think about about the there the the
fundamental physics nature of reality or

3738
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:18,730
fundamental physics nature of reality or
 

3739
01:10:18,730 --> 01:10:20,710
fundamental physics nature of reality or
another perspective the reason I think

3740
01:10:20,710 --> 01:10:20,720
another perspective the reason I think
 

3741
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:22,870
another perspective the reason I think
the simulation hypothesis is interesting

3742
01:10:22,870 --> 01:10:22,880
the simulation hypothesis is interesting
 

3743
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:27,700
the simulation hypothesis is interesting
is it's to think about how difficult is

3744
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:27,710
is it's to think about how difficult is
 

3745
01:10:27,710 --> 01:10:30,340
is it's to think about how difficult is
it to create sort of a virtual reality

3746
01:10:30,340 --> 01:10:30,350
it to create sort of a virtual reality
 

3747
01:10:30,350 --> 01:10:33,400
it to create sort of a virtual reality
game type situation that will be

3748
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:33,410
game type situation that will be
 

3749
01:10:33,410 --> 01:10:36,460
game type situation that will be
sufficiently convincing to us humans or

3750
01:10:36,460 --> 01:10:36,470
sufficiently convincing to us humans or
 

3751
01:10:36,470 --> 01:10:38,500
sufficiently convincing to us humans or
sufficiently enjoyable that would we

3752
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:38,510
sufficiently enjoyable that would we
 

3753
01:10:38,510 --> 01:10:40,750
sufficiently enjoyable that would we
wouldn't want to leave that's actually a

01:10:40,750 --> 01:10:40,760
wouldn't want to leave that's actually a
 

3755
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:42,710
wouldn't want to leave that's actually a
practical engineering

3756
01:10:42,710 --> 01:10:42,720
practical engineering
 

3757
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:45,530
practical engineering
and I I personally really enjoy virtual

3758
01:10:45,530 --> 01:10:45,540
and I I personally really enjoy virtual
 

3759
01:10:45,540 --> 01:10:47,870
and I I personally really enjoy virtual
reality but it's quite far away but I

3760
01:10:47,870 --> 01:10:47,880
reality but it's quite far away but I
 

3761
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:49,790
reality but it's quite far away but I
kind of think about what would it take

3762
01:10:49,790 --> 01:10:49,800
kind of think about what would it take
 

3763
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:51,590
kind of think about what would it take
for me to want to spend more time in

3764
01:10:51,590 --> 01:10:51,600
for me to want to spend more time in
 

3765
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:53,720
for me to want to spend more time in
virtual reality versus the real world

3766
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:53,730
virtual reality versus the real world
 

3767
01:10:53,730 --> 01:10:57,410
virtual reality versus the real world
and that's a that's a sort of a nice

3768
01:10:57,410 --> 01:10:57,420
and that's a that's a sort of a nice
 

3769
01:10:57,420 --> 01:11:00,610
and that's a that's a sort of a nice
clean question because at that point

3770
01:11:00,610 --> 01:11:00,620
clean question because at that point
 

3771
01:11:00,620 --> 01:11:04,010
clean question because at that point
we've reached if I want to live in a

3772
01:11:04,010 --> 01:11:04,020
we've reached if I want to live in a
 

3773
01:11:04,020 --> 01:11:05,960
we've reached if I want to live in a
virtual reality that means we're just a

3774
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:05,970
virtual reality that means we're just a
 

3775
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:07,430
virtual reality that means we're just a
few years away where majority of the

3776
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:07,440
few years away where majority of the
 

3777
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:09,080
few years away where majority of the
population lives in a virtual reality

3778
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:09,090
population lives in a virtual reality
 

3779
01:11:09,090 --> 01:11:10,550
population lives in a virtual reality
and that's how we create the simulation

3780
01:11:10,550 --> 01:11:10,560
and that's how we create the simulation
 

3781
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:12,050
and that's how we create the simulation
right you don't need to actually

3782
01:11:12,050 --> 01:11:12,060
right you don't need to actually
 

3783
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:15,380
right you don't need to actually
simulate the you know the quantum

3784
01:11:15,380 --> 01:11:15,390
simulate the you know the quantum
 

3785
01:11:15,390 --> 01:11:18,979
simulate the you know the quantum
gravity and just every aspect of the of

3786
01:11:18,979 --> 01:11:18,989
gravity and just every aspect of the of
 

3787
01:11:18,989 --> 01:11:20,810
gravity and just every aspect of the of
the universe and that's a read that the

3788
01:11:20,810 --> 01:11:20,820
the universe and that's a read that the
 

3789
01:11:20,820 --> 01:11:22,190
the universe and that's a read that the
interesting question for reinforcement

3790
01:11:22,190 --> 01:11:22,200
interesting question for reinforcement
 

3791
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:24,170
interesting question for reinforcement
learning too is if you want to make

3792
01:11:24,170 --> 01:11:24,180
learning too is if you want to make
 

3793
01:11:24,180 --> 01:11:25,970
learning too is if you want to make
sufficiently realistic simulations that

3794
01:11:25,970 --> 01:11:25,980
sufficiently realistic simulations that
 

3795
01:11:25,980 --> 01:11:29,150
sufficiently realistic simulations that
make it blend the difference between

3796
01:11:29,150 --> 01:11:29,160
make it blend the difference between
 

3797
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:30,440
make it blend the difference between
sort of the real world and the

3798
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:30,450
sort of the real world and the
 

3799
01:11:30,450 --> 01:11:34,370
sort of the real world and the
simulation there by just are the some of

3800
01:11:34,370 --> 01:11:34,380
simulation there by just are the some of
 

3801
01:11:34,380 --> 01:11:36,410
simulation there by just are the some of
the things we've been talking about kind

3802
01:11:36,410 --> 01:11:36,420
the things we've been talking about kind
 

3803
01:11:36,420 --> 01:11:38,300
the things we've been talking about kind
of the problems go away if we can create

3804
01:11:38,300 --> 01:11:38,310
of the problems go away if we can create
 

3805
01:11:38,310 --> 01:11:39,950
of the problems go away if we can create
actually interesting rich simulations

3806
01:11:39,950 --> 01:11:39,960
actually interesting rich simulations
 

3807
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:41,810
actually interesting rich simulations
it's an interesting question and it

3808
01:11:41,810 --> 01:11:41,820
it's an interesting question and it
 

3809
01:11:41,820 --> 01:11:43,430
it's an interesting question and it
actually I think your question

3810
01:11:43,430 --> 01:11:43,440
actually I think your question
 

3811
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:45,770
actually I think your question
casts your previous questions in a very

3812
01:11:45,770 --> 01:11:45,780
casts your previous questions in a very
 

3813
01:11:45,780 --> 01:11:47,830
casts your previous questions in a very
interesting light because in some ways

3814
01:11:47,830 --> 01:11:47,840
interesting light because in some ways
 

3815
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:51,800
interesting light because in some ways
asking whether we can well the more

3816
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:51,810
asking whether we can well the more
 

3817
01:11:51,810 --> 01:11:53,450
asking whether we can well the more
practical more kind of practical version

3818
01:11:53,450 --> 01:11:53,460
practical more kind of practical version
 

3819
01:11:53,460 --> 01:11:55,010
practical more kind of practical version
is like you know can we build simulators

3820
01:11:55,010 --> 01:11:55,020
is like you know can we build simulators
 

3821
01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:56,560
is like you know can we build simulators
that are good enough to train

3822
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:56,570
that are good enough to train
 

3823
01:11:56,570 --> 01:11:59,780
that are good enough to train
essentially AI systems that will work in

3824
01:11:59,780 --> 01:11:59,790
essentially AI systems that will work in
 

3825
01:11:59,790 --> 01:12:03,200
essentially AI systems that will work in
the world and it's kind of interesting

3826
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:03,210
the world and it's kind of interesting
 

3827
01:12:03,210 --> 01:12:04,760
the world and it's kind of interesting
to think about this about what this

3828
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:04,770
to think about this about what this
 

3829
01:12:04,770 --> 01:12:06,979
to think about this about what this
implies if true it kind of implies that

3830
01:12:06,979 --> 01:12:06,989
implies if true it kind of implies that
 

3831
01:12:06,989 --> 01:12:08,630
implies if true it kind of implies that
it's easier to create the universe than

3832
01:12:08,630 --> 01:12:08,640
it's easier to create the universe than
 

3833
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:11,479
it's easier to create the universe than
it is to create a brain and then it

3834
01:12:11,479 --> 01:12:11,489
it is to create a brain and then it
 

3835
01:12:11,489 --> 01:12:13,250
it is to create a brain and then it
seems like put this way it seems kind of

3836
01:12:13,250 --> 01:12:13,260
seems like put this way it seems kind of
 

3837
01:12:13,260 --> 01:12:16,610
seems like put this way it seems kind of
weird the aspect of the simulation most

3838
01:12:16,610 --> 01:12:16,620
weird the aspect of the simulation most
 

3839
01:12:16,620 --> 01:12:18,890
weird the aspect of the simulation most
interesting to me is the simulation of

3840
01:12:18,890 --> 01:12:18,900
interesting to me is the simulation of
 

3841
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:23,950
interesting to me is the simulation of
other humans that seems to be a

3842
01:12:23,950 --> 01:12:23,960
other humans that seems to be a
 

3843
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:26,420
other humans that seems to be a
complexity that makes the robotics

3844
01:12:26,420 --> 01:12:26,430
complexity that makes the robotics
 

3845
01:12:26,430 --> 01:12:28,850
complexity that makes the robotics
problem harder now I don't know if every

3846
01:12:28,850 --> 01:12:28,860
problem harder now I don't know if every
 

3847
01:12:28,860 --> 01:12:31,280
problem harder now I don't know if every
robotics person agrees with that notion

3848
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:31,290
robotics person agrees with that notion
 

3849
01:12:31,290 --> 01:12:34,070
robotics person agrees with that notion
just as a quick aside what are your

3850
01:12:34,070 --> 01:12:34,080
just as a quick aside what are your
 

3851
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:37,460
just as a quick aside what are your
thoughts about when the human enters the

3852
01:12:37,460 --> 01:12:37,470
thoughts about when the human enters the
 

3853
01:12:37,470 --> 01:12:40,130
thoughts about when the human enters the
picture of the robotics problem how does

3854
01:12:40,130 --> 01:12:40,140
picture of the robotics problem how does
 

3855
01:12:40,140 --> 01:12:41,360
picture of the robotics problem how does
that change the reinforcement learning

3856
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:41,370
that change the reinforcement learning
 

3857
01:12:41,370 --> 01:12:43,700
that change the reinforcement learning
problem the the learning problem in

3858
01:12:43,700 --> 01:12:43,710
problem the the learning problem in
 

3859
01:12:43,710 --> 01:12:47,090
problem the the learning problem in
general yeah I think that's a it's a

3860
01:12:47,090 --> 01:12:47,100
general yeah I think that's a it's a
 

3861
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:51,200
general yeah I think that's a it's a
kind of a complex question and I guess

3862
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:51,210
kind of a complex question and I guess
 

3863
01:12:51,210 --> 01:12:53,930
kind of a complex question and I guess
my hope for a while had been that if we

3864
01:12:53,930 --> 01:12:53,940
my hope for a while had been that if we
 

3865
01:12:53,940 --> 01:12:55,720
my hope for a while had been that if we
build these

3866
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:55,730
build these
 

3867
01:12:55,730 --> 01:12:57,940
build these
robotic learning systems that that are

3868
01:12:57,940 --> 01:12:57,950
robotic learning systems that that are
 

3869
01:12:57,950 --> 01:13:00,220
robotic learning systems that that are
multitask that utilize lots of prior

3870
01:13:00,220 --> 01:13:00,230
multitask that utilize lots of prior
 

3871
01:13:00,230 --> 01:13:01,960
multitask that utilize lots of prior
data and that learn from their own

3872
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:01,970
data and that learn from their own
 

3873
01:13:01,970 --> 01:13:04,150
data and that learn from their own
experience the bit where they have to

3874
01:13:04,150 --> 01:13:04,160
experience the bit where they have to
 

3875
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:06,310
experience the bit where they have to
interact with people will be perhaps

3876
01:13:06,310 --> 01:13:06,320
interact with people will be perhaps
 

3877
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:07,840
interact with people will be perhaps
handled in much the same way as all the

3878
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:07,850
handled in much the same way as all the
 

3879
01:13:07,850 --> 01:13:09,460
handled in much the same way as all the
other bits so if they have prior

3880
01:13:09,460 --> 01:13:09,470
other bits so if they have prior
 

3881
01:13:09,470 --> 01:13:11,080
other bits so if they have prior
experience in attracting with people and

3882
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:11,090
experience in attracting with people and
 

3883
01:13:11,090 --> 01:13:13,120
experience in attracting with people and
they can learn from their own experience

3884
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:13,130
they can learn from their own experience
 

3885
01:13:13,130 --> 01:13:14,290
they can learn from their own experience
of interacting with people for this new

3886
01:13:14,290 --> 01:13:14,300
of interacting with people for this new
 

3887
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:17,890
of interacting with people for this new
task maybe that'll be enough now of

3888
01:13:17,890 --> 01:13:17,900
task maybe that'll be enough now of
 

3889
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:19,420
task maybe that'll be enough now of
course there if it's not enough there

3890
01:13:19,420 --> 01:13:19,430
course there if it's not enough there
 

3891
01:13:19,430 --> 01:13:20,590
course there if it's not enough there
are many other things we can do and

3892
01:13:20,590 --> 01:13:20,600
are many other things we can do and
 

3893
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:21,700
are many other things we can do and
there's quite a bit of research on that

3894
01:13:21,700 --> 01:13:21,710
there's quite a bit of research on that
 

3895
01:13:21,710 --> 01:13:23,440
there's quite a bit of research on that
in that area but I think it's worth a

3896
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:23,450
in that area but I think it's worth a
 

3897
01:13:23,450 --> 01:13:27,520
in that area but I think it's worth a
shot to see whether the the the multi

3898
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:27,530
shot to see whether the the the multi
 

3899
01:13:27,530 --> 01:13:29,380
shot to see whether the the the multi
agent interaction the the ability to

3900
01:13:29,380 --> 01:13:29,390
agent interaction the the ability to
 

3901
01:13:29,390 --> 01:13:32,979
agent interaction the the ability to
understand that other beings in the

3902
01:13:32,979 --> 01:13:32,989
understand that other beings in the
 

3903
01:13:32,989 --> 01:13:34,780
understand that other beings in the
world have their own goals and tensions

3904
01:13:34,780 --> 01:13:34,790
world have their own goals and tensions
 

3905
01:13:34,790 --> 01:13:36,940
world have their own goals and tensions
and thoughts and so on whether that kind

3906
01:13:36,940 --> 01:13:36,950
and thoughts and so on whether that kind
 

3907
01:13:36,950 --> 01:13:38,880
and thoughts and so on whether that kind
of understanding can emerge

3908
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:38,890
of understanding can emerge
 

3909
01:13:38,890 --> 01:13:41,830
of understanding can emerge
automatically from simply learning to do

3910
01:13:41,830 --> 01:13:41,840
automatically from simply learning to do
 

3911
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:44,140
automatically from simply learning to do
things with and maximize utility that

01:13:44,140 --> 01:13:44,150
things with and maximize utility that

01:13:44,150 --> 01:13:46,960
things with and maximize utility that
information arises from the data you've

3914
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:46,970
information arises from the data you've
 

3915
01:13:46,970 --> 01:13:50,280
information arises from the data you've
said something about gravity sort of

3916
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:50,290
said something about gravity sort of
 

3917
01:13:50,290 --> 01:13:52,990
said something about gravity sort of
that you don't need to explicitly inject

3918
01:13:52,990 --> 01:13:53,000
that you don't need to explicitly inject
 

3919
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,430
that you don't need to explicitly inject
anything into the system they can be

3920
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:54,440
anything into the system they can be
 

3921
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:56,500
anything into the system they can be
learned from the data and gravity is an

3922
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:56,510
learned from the data and gravity is an
 

3923
01:13:56,510 --> 01:13:57,760
learned from the data and gravity is an
example of something that could be

3924
01:13:57,760 --> 01:13:57,770
example of something that could be
 

3925
01:13:57,770 --> 01:13:59,410
example of something that could be
learned from data sort of like the

01:13:59,410 --> 01:13:59,420
learned from data sort of like the
 

3927
01:13:59,420 --> 01:14:05,440
learned from data sort of like the
physics of the world like what what are

3928
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:05,450
physics of the world like what what are
 

3929
01:14:05,450 --> 01:14:06,700
physics of the world like what what are
the limits of what we can learn from

3930
01:14:06,700 --> 01:14:06,710
the limits of what we can learn from
 

3931
01:14:06,710 --> 01:14:09,940
the limits of what we can learn from
data do you really do you think we can

3932
01:14:09,940 --> 01:14:09,950
data do you really do you think we can
 

3933
01:14:09,950 --> 01:14:13,000
data do you really do you think we can
so a very simple clean way to ask that

3934
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:13,010
so a very simple clean way to ask that
 

3935
01:14:13,010 --> 01:14:14,560
so a very simple clean way to ask that
is do you really think we can learn

3936
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:14,570
is do you really think we can learn
 

3937
01:14:14,570 --> 01:14:18,190
is do you really think we can learn
gravity from just data the idea the the

3938
01:14:18,190 --> 01:14:18,200
gravity from just data the idea the the
 

3939
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:21,040
gravity from just data the idea the the
laws of gravity so it says something

3940
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:21,050
laws of gravity so it says something
 

3941
01:14:21,050 --> 01:14:23,590
laws of gravity so it says something
that I think is a common kind of pitfall

3942
01:14:23,590 --> 01:14:23,600
that I think is a common kind of pitfall
 

3943
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:25,930
that I think is a common kind of pitfall
when thinking about prior knowledge and

3944
01:14:25,930 --> 01:14:25,940
when thinking about prior knowledge and
 

3945
01:14:25,940 --> 01:14:30,010
when thinking about prior knowledge and
learning is to assume that just because

3946
01:14:30,010 --> 01:14:30,020
learning is to assume that just because
 

3947
01:14:30,020 --> 01:14:33,100
learning is to assume that just because
we know something then that it's better

3948
01:14:33,100 --> 01:14:33,110
we know something then that it's better
 

3949
01:14:33,110 --> 01:14:34,840
we know something then that it's better
to tell the Machine about that rather

3950
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:34,850
to tell the Machine about that rather
 

3951
01:14:34,850 --> 01:14:36,400
to tell the Machine about that rather
than have it I regret out on its own in

3952
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:36,410
than have it I regret out on its own in
 

3953
01:14:36,410 --> 01:14:41,140
than have it I regret out on its own in
many cases things that are important

3954
01:14:41,140 --> 01:14:41,150
many cases things that are important
 

3955
01:14:41,150 --> 01:14:43,780
many cases things that are important
that affect many of the events that the

3956
01:14:43,780 --> 01:14:43,790
that affect many of the events that the
 

3957
01:14:43,790 --> 01:14:45,610
that affect many of the events that the
Machine will experience are actually

3958
01:14:45,610 --> 01:14:45,620
Machine will experience are actually
 

3959
01:14:45,620 --> 01:14:47,560
Machine will experience are actually
pretty easy to learn like you know if

3960
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:47,570
pretty easy to learn like you know if
 

3961
01:14:47,570 --> 01:14:49,270
pretty easy to learn like you know if
things if every time you drop something

01:14:49,270 --> 01:14:49,280
things if every time you drop something
 

3963
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:51,310

it falls down like yeah you might not

01:14:51,310 --> 01:14:51,320
it falls down like yeah you might not
 

3965
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:53,260
it falls down like yeah you might not
get the you know you might get kind of

3966
01:14:53,260 --> 01:14:53,270
get the you know you might get kind of

will probably be sufficient for you to
 

3973
01:14:58,850 --> 01:15:01,960
will probably be sufficient for you to
act rationally in the world because you

act rationally in the world because you
 

3975
01:15:01,970 --> 01:15:03,610
act rationally in the world because you
see the phenomena all the time so things

we might not need to specify those by

we might not need to specify those by

it just feels like that there might be a

01:15:11,870 --> 01:15:11,880
it just feels like that there might be a

4001
01:15:30,690 --> 01:15:31,910

4007
01:15:35,940 --> 01:15:39,680

is that beautiful to you that this
 

4057
01:16:32,370 --> 01:16:34,180
is that beautiful to you that this
mechanism work as well as it does and

4058
01:16:34,180 --> 01:16:34,190
mechanism work as well as it does and
 

4059
01:16:34,190 --> 01:16:38,120
mechanism work as well as it does and
also can be generalized to other context

that's applicable to the real world I
 

4065
01:16:43,350 --> 01:16:47,150
that's applicable to the real world I
think that it's a very interesting idea

think that it's a very interesting idea
 

4067
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:50,330
think that it's a very interesting idea
and I suspect that the bottleneck to

and I suspect that the bottleneck to
 

4069
01:16:50,340 --> 01:16:53,270
and I suspect that the bottleneck to
actually generalizing it to the robotic

01:16:53,270 --> 01:16:53,280
actually generalizing it to the robotic
 

4071
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:54,800
actually generalizing it to the robotic
setting is actually gonna be the same as

setting is actually gonna be the same as
 

4073
01:16:54,810 --> 01:16:56,810

there's no shortcut around that you have

4096
01:17:18,170 --> 01:17:18,180
there's no shortcut around that you have
 

4097
01:17:18,180 --> 01:17:19,250
there's no shortcut around that you have
to interact with the national

well because in in a self play setting

4102
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:22,970
well because in in a self play setting
 

4103
01:17:22,970 --> 01:17:24,730
well because in in a self play setting
you still need a mediating mechanisms so

4104
01:17:24,730 --> 01:17:24,740
you still need a mediating mechanisms so
 

4105
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:27,730
you still need a mediating mechanisms so
the the reason that you know self play

4106
01:17:27,730 --> 01:17:27,740
the the reason that you know self play
 

4107
01:17:27,740 --> 01:17:29,830
the the reason that you know self play
works for a board game is because the

4108
01:17:29,830 --> 01:17:29,840
works for a board game is because the
 

4109
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:31,840
works for a board game is because the
rules of that board game mediate the

4110
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:31,850
rules of that board game mediate the
 

4111
01:17:31,850 --> 01:17:34,000
rules of that board game mediate the
interaction between the agents so the

4112
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:34,010
interaction between the agents so the
 

4113
01:17:34,010 --> 01:17:35,590
interaction between the agents so the
kind of intelligent behavior that will

4114
01:17:35,590 --> 01:17:35,600
kind of intelligent behavior that will
 

4115
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:37,510
kind of intelligent behavior that will
emerge depends very heavily on the

4116
01:17:37,510 --> 01:17:37,520
emerge depends very heavily on the
 

4117
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:40,120
emerge depends very heavily on the
nature of that mediating mechanism so on

4118
01:17:40,120 --> 01:17:40,130
nature of that mediating mechanism so on
 

4119
01:17:40,130 --> 01:17:42,220
nature of that mediating mechanism so on
the side of reward functions that's

4120
01:17:42,220 --> 01:17:42,230
the side of reward functions that's
 

4121
01:17:42,230 --> 01:17:44,140
the side of reward functions that's
coming up with good reward function

4122
01:17:44,140 --> 01:17:44,150
coming up with good reward function
 

4123
01:17:44,150 --> 01:17:45,970
coming up with good reward function
seems to be the thing that we associate

4124
01:17:45,970 --> 01:17:45,980
seems to be the thing that we associate
 

4125
01:17:45,980 --> 01:17:50,110
seems to be the thing that we associate
with general Intel like human beings

with general Intel like human beings
 

4127

seem to value the idea of developing our
 

4129
01:17:52,130 --> 01:17:55,330
seem to value the idea of developing our

for reinforcement learning we often kind

of specify that's the given what's your
 

4137
01:18:03,020 --> 01:18:06,520
of specify that's the given what's your
sense of how we develop a reward for

good you know good reward functions yeah

4140
01:18:09,070 --> 01:18:09,080
good you know good reward functions yeah

01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:11,320
good you know good reward functions yeah
I think that's a very complicated and

01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:11,330
I think that's a very complicated and
 

4143
01:18:11,330 --> 01:18:12,790
I think that's a very complicated and
very deep question and you're completely

01:18:12,790 --> 01:18:12,800
very deep question and you're completely
 

4145
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:14,830
very deep question and you're completely
right that classically in reinforcement

4146
01:18:14,830 --> 01:18:14,840
right that classically in reinforcement
 

4147
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:18,310
right that classically in reinforcement
learning this question has kind of been

4148
01:18:18,310 --> 01:18:18,320
learning this question has kind of been
 

4149
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:19,840
learning this question has kind of been
treated as a non-issue that you sort of

4150
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:19,850
treated as a non-issue that you sort of
 

4151
01:18:19,850 --> 01:18:22,240
treated as a non-issue that you sort of
treat the reward as this external thing

4152
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:22,250
treat the reward as this external thing
 

4153

that comes from some other bit of your

4154
01:18:25,210 --> 01:18:25,220
that comes from some other bit of your
 

4155
01:18:25,220 --> 01:18:27,850
that comes from some other bit of your
biology and you can don't worry about it

4156
01:18:27,850 --> 01:18:27,860
biology and you can don't worry about it
 

4157
01:18:27,860 --> 01:18:30,760
biology and you can don't worry about it
and I do think that that's actually you

4158
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:30,770
and I do think that that's actually you
 

4159
01:18:30,770 --> 01:18:32,140
and I do think that that's actually you
know a little bit of a mistake that we

4160
01:18:32,140 --> 01:18:32,150
know a little bit of a mistake that we
 

4161
01:18:32,150 --> 01:18:33,610
know a little bit of a mistake that we
shouldn't worry about it and we can

4162
01:18:33,610 --> 01:18:33,620
shouldn't worry about it and we can
 

4163
01:18:33,620 --> 01:18:34,930
shouldn't worry about it and we can
approach you in a few different ways we

4164
01:18:34,930 --> 01:18:34,940
approach you in a few different ways we
 

4165
01:18:34,940 --> 01:18:37,420
approach you in a few different ways we
can approach it for instance by thinking

4166
01:18:37,420 --> 01:18:37,430
can approach it for instance by thinking
 

4167
01:18:37,430 --> 01:18:39,070
can approach it for instance by thinking
of rewards as a communication medium we

4168
01:18:39,070 --> 01:18:39,080
of rewards as a communication medium we
 

4169
01:18:39,080 --> 01:18:40,360
of rewards as a communication medium we
can say well how does a person

4170
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:40,370
can say well how does a person
 

4171
01:18:40,370 --> 01:18:42,130
can say well how does a person
communicate to a robot what its

4172
01:18:42,130 --> 01:18:42,140
communicate to a robot what its
 

4173
01:18:42,140 --> 01:18:44,650
communicate to a robot what its
objective is you can approach it also as

4174
01:18:44,650 --> 01:18:44,660
objective is you can approach it also as
 

4175
01:18:44,660 --> 01:18:47,440
objective is you can approach it also as
sort of more of an intrinsic motivation

4176
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:47,450
sort of more of an intrinsic motivation
 

4177
01:18:47,450 --> 01:18:49,620
sort of more of an intrinsic motivation
medium you could say can we write down

4178
01:18:49,620 --> 01:18:49,630
medium you could say can we write down
 

4179
01:18:49,630 --> 01:18:52,120
medium you could say can we write down
kind of a general objective that leads

4180
01:18:52,120 --> 01:18:52,130
kind of a general objective that leads
 

4181
01:18:52,130 --> 01:18:55,750
kind of a general objective that leads
to good capability like for example can

4182
01:18:55,750 --> 01:18:55,760
to good capability like for example can
 

4183
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:57,130
to good capability like for example can
you write down some objective such that

4184
01:18:57,130 --> 01:18:57,140
you write down some objective such that
 

4185
01:18:57,140 --> 01:18:58,900
you write down some objective such that
even in the absence of any other task if

4186
01:18:58,900 --> 01:18:58,910
even in the absence of any other task if
 

4187
01:18:58,910 --> 01:19:00,520
even in the absence of any other task if
you maximize that objective you'll sort

4188
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:00,530
you maximize that objective you'll sort

01:19:53,070 --> 01:19:54,590
discover stable niches in the world you
can discover that if you're playing

4242
01:19:54,590 --> 01:19:54,600
can discover that if you're playing
 

4243
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:57,439
can discover that if you're playing
Tetris then correctly you know clearing

4244
01:19:57,439 --> 01:19:57,449
Tetris then correctly you know clearing
 

4245
01:19:57,449 --> 01:19:59,000
Tetris then correctly you know clearing
the rows will let you play Tetris for

4246
01:19:59,000 --> 01:19:59,010
the rows will let you play Tetris for
 

4247
01:19:59,010 --> 01:20:00,500
the rows will let you play Tetris for
longer and keep the board nice and clean

4248
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:00,510
longer and keep the board nice and clean
 

4249
01:20:00,510 --> 01:20:02,570
longer and keep the board nice and clean
which sort of satisfies some desire for

01:20:02,570 --> 01:20:02,580
which sort of satisfies some desire for
 

4251
01:20:02,580 --> 01:20:04,820
which sort of satisfies some desire for
order in the world and as a result to

4252
01:20:04,820 --> 01:20:04,830
order in the world and as a result to
 

4253
01:20:04,830 --> 01:20:06,260
order in the world and as a result to
get some degree of leverage over your

01:20:06,260 --> 01:20:06,270
get some degree of leverage over your
 

4255
01:20:06,270 --> 01:20:08,300
get some degree of leverage over your
domain so we're exploring that pretty

4256
01:20:08,300 --> 01:20:08,310
domain so we're exploring that pretty
 

4257
01:20:08,310 --> 01:20:11,030
domain so we're exploring that pretty
actively is there a role for a human

about the war the world so one of the
 

4265
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:21,500
about the war the world so one of the
things that I'm pretty interested in is

01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:21,510
things that I'm pretty interested in is
 

4267
01:20:21,510 --> 01:20:25,060
things that I'm pretty interested in is
actually whether discovering new things

4268
01:20:25,060 --> 01:20:25,070
actually whether discovering new things
 

4269
01:20:25,070 --> 01:20:27,590
actually whether discovering new things
can actually be an emergent property of

4270
01:20:27,590 --> 01:20:27,600
can actually be an emergent property of
 

4271
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:29,439
can actually be an emergent property of
some other objective that quantifies

4272
01:20:29,439 --> 01:20:29,449
some other objective that quantifies
 

4273
01:20:29,449 --> 01:20:32,120
some other objective that quantifies
capability so new things for the sake of

4274
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:32,130
capability so new things for the sake of
 

4275
01:20:32,130 --> 01:20:35,600
capability so new things for the sake of
new things maybe it's not maybe might

4276
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:35,610
new things maybe it's not maybe might
 

4277
01:20:35,610 --> 01:20:37,370
new things maybe it's not maybe might
not by itself be the right answer but

4278
01:20:37,370 --> 01:20:37,380
not by itself be the right answer but
 

4279
01:20:37,380 --> 01:20:39,530
not by itself be the right answer but
perhaps we can figure out an objective

4280
01:20:39,530 --> 01:20:39,540
perhaps we can figure out an objective
 

4281
01:20:39,540 --> 01:20:41,990
perhaps we can figure out an objective
for which discovering new things is

4282
01:20:41,990 --> 01:20:42,000
for which discovering new things is
 

4283
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,300
for which discovering new things is
actually the natural consequence that's

4284
01:20:44,300 --> 01:20:44,310
actually the natural consequence that's
 

4285
01:20:44,310 --> 01:20:45,979
actually the natural consequence that's
something we're working on right now but

01:20:45,979 --> 01:20:45,989
something we're working on right now but

01:20:45,989 --> 01:20:47,300
something we're working on right now but
I don't have a clear answer for you

I don't have a clear answer for you
there yet that's still work-in-progress

yeah so classically this is something

4316
01:21:28,610 --> 01:21:28,620
yeah so classically this is something
 

4317
01:21:28,620 --> 01:21:29,510
yeah so classically this is something
that has been pretty hard in

4318
01:21:29,510 --> 01:21:29,520
that has been pretty hard in
 

4319
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:31,370
that has been pretty hard in
reinforcement learning because it's

4320
01:21:31,370 --> 01:21:31,380
reinforcement learning because it's
 

4321
01:21:31,380 --> 01:21:33,709
reinforcement learning because it's
difficult for a designer to have good

4322
01:21:33,709 --> 01:21:33,719
difficult for a designer to have good
 

4323
01:21:33,719 --> 01:21:35,450
difficult for a designer to have good
intuition about you know what a learning

4325
01:21:35,460 --> 01:21:36,649
intuition about you know what a learning
outcome will come up with when they give

4326
01:21:36,649 --> 01:21:36,659
outcome will come up with when they give
 

4327
01:21:36,659 --> 01:21:39,470
outcome will come up with when they give
it some objective there are ways to

4328
01:21:39,470 --> 01:21:39,480
it some objective there are ways to
 

4329
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:41,180
it some objective there are ways to
mitigate that one way to mitigate it is

4330
01:21:41,180 --> 01:21:41,190
mitigate that one way to mitigate it is
 

4331
01:21:41,190 --> 01:21:43,490
mitigate that one way to mitigate it is
to actually define an objective that

4332
01:21:43,490 --> 01:21:43,500
to actually define an objective that
 

4333
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:45,600
to actually define an objective that
says like don't do weird stuff

4334
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:45,610
says like don't do weird stuff
 

4335
01:21:45,610 --> 01:21:47,130
says like don't do weird stuff
you can actually quantify you can say

4336
01:21:47,130 --> 01:21:47,140
you can actually quantify you can say
 

4337
01:21:47,140 --> 01:21:49,440
you can actually quantify you can say
just like don't enter situations that

4338
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:49,450
just like don't enter situations that
 

4339
01:21:49,450 --> 01:21:51,810
just like don't enter situations that
have low probability under the

4340
01:21:51,810 --> 01:21:51,820
have low probability under the
 

4341
01:21:51,820 --> 01:21:53,190
have low probability under the
distribution of states you've seen

4342
01:21:53,190 --> 01:21:53,200
distribution of states you've seen
 

4343
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:55,440
distribution of states you've seen
before it turns out that that's actually

4344
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:55,450
before it turns out that that's actually
 

4345
01:21:55,450 --> 01:21:57,060
before it turns out that that's actually
one very good way to do off policy

4346
01:21:57,060 --> 01:21:57,070
one very good way to do off policy
 

4347
01:21:57,070 --> 01:22:00,030
one very good way to do off policy
reinforcement learning actually so we

4348
01:22:00,030 --> 01:22:00,040
reinforcement learning actually so we
 

4349
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:02,960
reinforcement learning actually so we
can do some things like that if we

4350
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:02,970
can do some things like that if we
 

4351
01:22:02,970 --> 01:22:06,270
can do some things like that if we
slowly venture in speaking about reward

4352
01:22:06,270 --> 01:22:06,280
slowly venture in speaking about reward

maybe rather than unintended
consequences for objectives that are

consequences for objectives that are
 

4401
01:23:11,530 --> 01:23:13,110
consequences for objectives that are
specified too well I'm actually more

specified too well I'm actually more
 

4403
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:14,640
specified too well I'm actually more
worried right now about unintended

4404
01:23:14,640 --> 01:23:14,650
worried right now about unintended
 

4405
01:23:14,650 --> 01:23:16,290
worried right now about unintended
consequences for objectives that are not

4406
01:23:16,290 --> 01:23:16,300
consequences for objectives that are not
 

4407
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:19,680
consequences for objectives that are not
optimized well enough which might become

4408
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:19,690
optimized well enough which might become
 

4409
01:23:19,690 --> 01:23:22,020
optimized well enough which might become
a very pressing problem when we for

4410
01:23:22,020 --> 01:23:22,030
a very pressing problem when we for
 

4411
01:23:22,030 --> 01:23:24,120
a very pressing problem when we for
instance try to use these techniques for

4412
01:23:24,120 --> 01:23:24,130
instance try to use these techniques for
 

4413
01:23:24,130 --> 01:23:26,400
instance try to use these techniques for
safety critical systems like cars and

4414
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:26,410
safety critical systems like cars and
 

4415
01:23:26,410 --> 01:23:29,220
safety critical systems like cars and
aircraft and so on I think at some point

4416
01:23:29,220 --> 01:23:29,230
aircraft and so on I think at some point
 

4417
01:23:29,230 --> 01:23:31,020
aircraft and so on I think at some point
we'll face the issue of objectives being

01:23:31,020 --> 01:23:31,030
we'll face the issue of objectives being
 

4419
01:23:31,030 --> 01:23:33,180
we'll face the issue of objectives being
optimized too well but right now I think

4420
01:23:33,180 --> 01:23:33,190
optimized too well but right now I think
 

4421
01:23:33,190 --> 01:23:35,190
optimized too well but right now I think
we're more likely to face the issue of

we're more likely to face the issue of
 

4423
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:37,140
we're more likely to face the issue of
them not being optimized well enough but

4424
01:23:37,140 --> 01:23:37,150
them not being optimized well enough but
 

4425
01:23:37,150 --> 01:23:38,610
them not being optimized well enough but
you don't think on intended consequence

4426
01:23:38,610 --> 01:23:38,620
you don't think on intended consequence
 

4427
01:23:38,620 --> 01:23:40,440
you don't think on intended consequence
can arise even when you're far from

01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:40,450
can arise even when you're far from
 

4429
01:23:40,450 --> 01:23:42,690
can arise even when you're far from
optimality sort of like on the path to

01:23:42,690 --> 01:23:42,700
optimality sort of like on the path to

consequence can absolutely arise it's
 

4435
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:48,990

just I think right now the bottleneck

01:23:48,990 --> 01:23:49,000
just I think right now the bottleneck
 

4437
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,840
just I think right now the bottleneck
for improving reliability safety and

for improving reliability safety and
 

4439
01:23:51,850 --> 01:23:54,360
for improving reliability safety and
things like that is more with systems

technology but I think that the these
 

4465
01:24:24,059 --> 01:24:25,430
technology but I think that the these
kinds of problems can take many forms

01:29:36,740 --> 01:29:36,750
if this is like a scientifically like
 

4715
01:29:36,750 --> 01:29:40,410
if this is like a scientifically like
particularly meaningful answer but like

4716
01:29:40,410 --> 01:29:40,420
particularly meaningful answer but like
 

4717
01:29:40,420 --> 01:29:42,390
particularly meaningful answer but like
the honest answers that I I actually

4718
01:29:42,390 --> 01:29:42,400
the honest answers that I I actually
 

4719
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:45,360
the honest answers that I I actually
found a lot of the work by Isaac Asimov

4720
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:45,370
found a lot of the work by Isaac Asimov
 

4721
01:29:45,370 --> 01:29:47,490
found a lot of the work by Isaac Asimov
to be very inspiring when I was younger

4722
01:29:47,490 --> 01:29:47,500
to be very inspiring when I was younger
 

4723
01:29:47,500 --> 01:29:48,959
to be very inspiring when I was younger
I don't know if that has anything to do

4724
01:29:48,959 --> 01:29:48,969
I don't know if that has anything to do
 

4725
01:29:48,969 --> 01:29:51,240
I don't know if that has anything to do
with with AI necessarily you don't think

4726
01:29:51,240 --> 01:29:51,250
with with AI necessarily you don't think
 

4727
01:29:51,250 --> 01:29:52,770
with with AI necessarily you don't think
it had a ripple effect in your life

4728
01:29:52,770 --> 01:29:52,780
it had a ripple effect in your life
 

4729
01:29:52,780 --> 01:29:57,060
it had a ripple effect in your life
maybe it did but yeah I like I think

4730
01:29:57,060 --> 01:29:57,070
maybe it did but yeah I like I think
 

4731
01:29:57,070 --> 01:30:03,419
maybe it did but yeah I like I think
that a vision of a future where well

4732
01:30:03,419 --> 01:30:03,429
that a vision of a future where well
 

4733

4740
01:30:15,540 --> 01:30:15,550
place a big role in society and where we
 

4741
01:30:15,550 --> 01:30:18,240
place a big role in society and where we
try to imagine the sort of the the

try to imagine the sort of the the
 

4743

limiting case of technological and
 

4745
01:30:19,870 --> 01:30:21,450
limiting case of technological and
advancement and how that might play out

4746
01:30:21,450 --> 01:30:21,460
advancement and how that might play out
 

4747
01:30:21,460 --> 01:30:26,100
advancement and how that might play out
in in our future history but yeah I

4748
01:30:26,100 --> 01:30:26,110
in in our future history but yeah I
 

4749
01:30:26,110 --> 01:30:29,490
in in our future history but yeah I
think that the that was in some way

4750
01:30:29,490 --> 01:30:29,500
think that the that was in some way
 

4751
01:30:29,500 --> 01:30:32,000
think that the that was in some way
influential I don't really know how but

4752
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:32,010
influential I don't really know how but
 

4753
01:30:32,010 --> 01:30:34,800
influential I don't really know how but
and I would recommend it I mean if

4754
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:34,810
and I would recommend it I mean if
 

4755
01:30:34,810 --> 01:30:37,050
and I would recommend it I mean if
nothing else you'd be well entertained

4756
01:30:37,050 --> 01:30:37,060
nothing else you'd be well entertained

nothing else you'd be well entertained
did you first yourself like fall in love

4758
01:30:39,270 --> 01:30:39,280
did you first yourself like fall in love
 

4759
01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:40,850
did you first yourself like fall in love
with the idea of artificial intelligence

4760
01:30:40,850 --> 01:30:40,860
with the idea of artificial intelligence

get captivated by this field so my

4762
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:45,610
get captivated by this field so my
 

4763
01:30:45,610 --> 01:30:48,330
get captivated by this field so my
honest answer here is actually that I

4764
01:30:48,330 --> 01:30:48,340
honest answer here is actually that I
 

4765
01:30:48,340 --> 01:30:51,090
honest answer here is actually that I
only really started to think think about

4766
01:30:51,090 --> 01:30:51,100
only really started to think think about
 

4767
01:30:51,100 --> 01:30:52,800
only really started to think think about
it as a that's something that I might

4768
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:52,810
it as a that's something that I might
 

4769
01:30:52,810 --> 01:30:54,780
it as a that's something that I might
want to do actually in graduate school

4770
01:30:54,780 --> 01:30:54,790
want to do actually in graduate school
 

4771
01:30:54,790 --> 01:30:57,270
want to do actually in graduate school
pretty light and a big part of that was

4772
01:30:57,270 --> 01:30:57,280
pretty light and a big part of that was
 

4773
01:30:57,280 --> 01:30:59,640
pretty light and a big part of that was
that until you know somewhere around

4774
01:30:59,640 --> 01:30:59,650
that until you know somewhere around
 

4775
01:30:59,650 --> 01:31:03,330
that until you know somewhere around
2009 2010 it just wasn't really high on

4776
01:31:03,330 --> 01:31:03,340
2009 2010 it just wasn't really high on
 

4777
01:31:03,340 --> 01:31:05,940
2009 2010 it just wasn't really high on
my priority list because I I didn't

4778
01:31:05,940 --> 01:31:05,950
my priority list because I I didn't
 

4779
01:31:05,950 --> 01:31:07,080
my priority list because I I didn't
think that it was something where we're

4780
01:31:07,080 --> 01:31:07,090
think that it was something where we're
 

4781
01:31:07,090 --> 01:31:08,940
think that it was something where we're
going to see very substantial advances

4782
01:31:08,940 --> 01:31:08,950
going to see very substantial advances
 

4783
01:31:08,950 --> 01:31:14,310
going to see very substantial advances
in my lifetime and you know maybe in

4784
01:31:14,310 --> 01:31:14,320
in my lifetime and you know maybe in
 

4785
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:16,050
in my lifetime and you know maybe in
terms of my career the time when I

4786
01:31:16,050 --> 01:31:16,060
terms of my career the time when I
 

4787
01:31:16,060 --> 01:31:18,950
terms of my career the time when I
really decided I wanted to work on this

4788
01:31:18,950 --> 01:31:18,960
really decided I wanted to work on this
 

4789
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:21,630
really decided I wanted to work on this
was when I actually took a seminar

4790
01:31:21,630 --> 01:31:21,640
was when I actually took a seminar
 

4791
01:31:21,640 --> 01:31:23,370
was when I actually took a seminar
course that was taught by Professor and

4792
01:31:23,370 --> 01:31:23,380
course that was taught by Professor and
 

4793
01:31:23,380 --> 01:31:26,160
course that was taught by Professor and
ring and you know at that point I of

4794
01:31:26,160 --> 01:31:26,170
ring and you know at that point I of
 

4795
01:31:26,170 --> 01:31:28,080
ring and you know at that point I of
course had some had like a decent

4796
01:31:28,080 --> 01:31:28,090
course had some had like a decent
 

4797
01:31:28,090 --> 01:31:29,580
course had some had like a decent
understanding of the technical things

4798
01:31:29,580 --> 01:31:29,590
understanding of the technical things
 

4799
01:31:29,590 --> 01:31:30,930
understanding of the technical things
involved but one of the things that

4800
01:31:30,930 --> 01:31:30,940
involved but one of the things that
 

4801
01:31:30,940 --> 01:31:32,130
involved but one of the things that
really resonated with me was when he

4802
01:31:32,130 --> 01:31:32,140
really resonated with me was when he
 

4803
01:31:32,140 --> 01:31:34,080
really resonated with me was when he
said in the opening lecture something to

4804
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:34,090
said in the opening lecture something to
 

4805
01:31:34,090 --> 01:31:36,000
said in the opening lecture something to
the effect of like well he used to have

4806
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:36,010
the effect of like well he used to have
 

4807
01:31:36,010 --> 01:31:37,470
the effect of like well he used to have
graduate students come to him and talk

4808
01:31:37,470 --> 01:31:37,480
graduate students come to him and talk
 

4809
01:31:37,480 --> 01:31:39,630
graduate students come to him and talk
about how they want to work on AI and he

4810
01:31:39,630 --> 01:31:39,640
about how they want to work on AI and he
 

4811
01:31:39,640 --> 01:31:41,160
about how they want to work on AI and he
would kind of chuckle and give them some

4812
01:31:41,160 --> 01:31:41,170
would kind of chuckle and give them some
 

4813
01:31:41,170 --> 01:31:42,990
would kind of chuckle and give them some
math problem to deal with but now he's

4814
01:31:42,990 --> 01:31:43,000
math problem to deal with but now he's
 

4815
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:44,640
math problem to deal with but now he's
actually thinking that this is an area

4816
01:31:44,640 --> 01:31:44,650
actually thinking that this is an area
 

4817
01:31:44,650 --> 01:31:45,960
actually thinking that this is an area
where we might see like substantial

4818
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:45,970
where we might see like substantial
 

4819
01:31:45,970 --> 01:31:48,120
where we might see like substantial
advances in our lifetime and that kind

4820
01:31:48,120 --> 01:31:48,130
advances in our lifetime and that kind
 

4821
01:31:48,130 --> 01:31:50,670
advances in our lifetime and that kind
of got me thinking because you know it's

4822
01:31:50,670 --> 01:31:50,680
of got me thinking because you know it's
 

4823
01:31:50,680 --> 01:31:52,890
of got me thinking because you know it's
an abstract sense yeah like you can kind

4824
01:31:52,890 --> 01:31:52,900
an abstract sense yeah like you can kind
 

4825
01:31:52,900 --> 01:31:54,780
an abstract sense yeah like you can kind
of imagine not but in a very real sense

4826
01:31:54,780 --> 01:31:54,790
of imagine not but in a very real sense
 

4827
01:31:54,790 --> 01:31:57,060
of imagine not but in a very real sense
when someone who had been working on

4828
01:31:57,060 --> 01:31:57,070
when someone who had been working on
 

4829
01:31:57,070 --> 01:31:58,580
when someone who had been working on
that kind of stuff their whole career

4830
01:31:58,580 --> 01:31:58,590
that kind of stuff their whole career
 

4831
01:31:58,590 --> 01:32:01,920
that kind of stuff their whole career
suddenly says that yeah like that had

4832
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:01,930
suddenly says that yeah like that had
 

4833
01:32:01,930 --> 01:32:04,350
suddenly says that yeah like that had
that had some effect on me yeah this

4834
01:32:04,350 --> 01:32:04,360
that had some effect on me yeah this
 

4835
01:32:04,360 --> 01:32:05,850
that had some effect on me yeah this
might be a special moment in the history

4836
01:32:05,850 --> 01:32:05,860
might be a special moment in the history
 

4837
01:32:05,860 --> 01:32:10,200
might be a special moment in the history
of the field that this is where we might

4838
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:10,210
of the field that this is where we might
 

4839
01:32:10,210 --> 01:32:13,680
of the field that this is where we might
see some some interesting breakthroughs

4840
01:32:13,680 --> 01:32:13,690
see some some interesting breakthroughs
 

4841
01:32:13,690 --> 01:32:16,680
see some some interesting breakthroughs
so in the space of advice somebody who's

4842
01:32:16,680 --> 01:32:16,690
so in the space of advice somebody who's
 

4843
01:32:16,690 --> 01:32:18,510
so in the space of advice somebody who's
interested in getting started and

4844
01:32:18,510 --> 01:32:18,520
interested in getting started and
 

4845
01:32:18,520 --> 01:32:20,010
interested in getting started and
machine learning or reinforcement

4846
01:32:20,010 --> 01:32:20,020
machine learning or reinforcement
 

4847
01:32:20,020 --> 01:32:22,140
machine learning or reinforcement
learning what advice would you give to

4848
01:32:22,140 --> 01:32:22,150
learning what advice would you give to
 

4849
01:32:22,150 --> 01:32:23,940
learning what advice would you give to
maybe an undergraduate student or maybe

4850
01:32:23,940 --> 01:32:23,950
maybe an undergraduate student or maybe
 

4851
01:32:23,950 --> 01:32:26,370
maybe an undergraduate student or maybe
even younger how what are the first

4852
01:32:26,370 --> 01:32:26,380
even younger how what are the first
 

4853
01:32:26,380 --> 01:32:29,460
even younger how what are the first
steps to take and further on what are

4854
01:32:29,460 --> 01:32:29,470
steps to take and further on what are
 

4855
01:32:29,470 --> 01:32:31,790
steps to take and further on what are
the stapes steps to take on that journey

4856
01:32:31,790 --> 01:32:31,800
the stapes steps to take on that journey
 

4857
01:32:31,800 --> 01:32:36,300
the stapes steps to take on that journey
so something that I think is important

4858
01:32:36,300 --> 01:32:36,310
so something that I think is important
 

4859
01:32:36,310 --> 01:32:42,090
so something that I think is important
to do is to is to not be afraid to like

4860
01:32:42,090 --> 01:32:42,100
to do is to is to not be afraid to like
 

4861
01:32:42,100 --> 01:32:44,490
to do is to is to not be afraid to like
spend time imagining the kind of outcome

4862
01:32:44,490 --> 01:32:44,500
spend time imagining the kind of outcome
 

4863
01:32:44,500 --> 01:32:46,710
spend time imagining the kind of outcome
that you might like to see so you know

4864
01:32:46,710 --> 01:32:46,720
that you might like to see so you know
 

4865
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:49,750
that you might like to see so you know
one outcome might be a successful career

4866
01:32:49,750 --> 01:32:49,760
one outcome might be a successful career
 

4867
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:51,010
one outcome might be a successful career
large paycheck or something or

4868
01:32:51,010 --> 01:32:51,020
large paycheck or something or
 

4869
01:32:51,020 --> 01:32:52,660
large paycheck or something or
state-of-the-art results in some

4870
01:32:52,660 --> 01:32:52,670
state-of-the-art results in some
 

4871
01:32:52,670 --> 01:32:54,550
state-of-the-art results in some
benchmark but hopefully that's not the

4872
01:32:54,550 --> 01:32:54,560
benchmark but hopefully that's not the
 

4873
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:55,960
benchmark but hopefully that's not the
thing that's like the main driving force

4874
01:32:55,960 --> 01:32:55,970
thing that's like the main driving force
 

4875
01:32:55,970 --> 01:33:00,730
thing that's like the main driving force
for somebody but I I think that if

4876
01:33:00,730 --> 01:33:00,740
for somebody but I I think that if
 

4877
01:33:00,740 --> 01:33:02,290
for somebody but I I think that if
someone who's a student considering a

4878
01:33:02,290 --> 01:33:02,300
someone who's a student considering a
 

4879
01:33:02,300 --> 01:33:04,540
someone who's a student considering a
career in AI like takes a little while

4880
01:33:04,540 --> 01:33:04,550
career in AI like takes a little while
 

4881
01:33:04,550 --> 01:33:06,220
career in AI like takes a little while
sits down and thinks like what do I

4882
01:33:06,220 --> 01:33:06,230
sits down and thinks like what do I
 

4883
01:33:06,230 --> 01:33:07,930
sits down and thinks like what do I
really want to see what I want to see a

4884
01:33:07,930 --> 01:33:07,940
really want to see what I want to see a
 

4885
01:33:07,940 --> 01:33:09,490
really want to see what I want to see a
machine do what I want what do I want to

4886
01:33:09,490 --> 01:33:09,500
machine do what I want what do I want to
 

4887
01:33:09,500 --> 01:33:10,930
machine do what I want what do I want to
see a robot do what I want to do and

4888
01:33:10,930 --> 01:33:10,940
see a robot do what I want to do and
 

4889
01:33:10,940 --> 01:33:12,130
see a robot do what I want to do and
what I want to see a natural language

4890
01:33:12,130 --> 01:33:12,140
what I want to see a natural language
 

4891
01:33:12,140 --> 01:33:14,680
what I want to see a natural language
system just like imagine you know

4892
01:33:14,680 --> 01:33:14,690
system just like imagine you know
 

4893
01:33:14,690 --> 01:33:16,510
system just like imagine you know
imagine it almost like a commercial for

4894
01:33:16,510 --> 01:33:16,520
imagine it almost like a commercial for
 

4895
01:33:16,520 --> 01:33:18,400
imagine it almost like a commercial for
a future product or something or like

4896
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:18,410
a future product or something or like
 

4897
01:33:18,410 --> 01:33:20,080
a future product or something or like
like something that you'd like to see in

4898
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:20,090
like something that you'd like to see in
 

4899
01:33:20,090 --> 01:33:22,720
like something that you'd like to see in
the world and then actually sit down and

4900
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:22,730
the world and then actually sit down and
 

4901
01:33:22,730 --> 01:33:23,620
the world and then actually sit down and
think about the steps that are necessary

4902
01:33:23,620 --> 01:33:23,630
think about the steps that are necessary
 

4903
01:33:23,630 --> 01:33:26,080
think about the steps that are necessary
to get there and hopefully that thing is

4904
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:26,090
to get there and hopefully that thing is
 

4905
01:33:26,090 --> 01:33:28,060
to get there and hopefully that thing is
not a better number on imagenet

4906
01:33:28,060 --> 01:33:28,070
not a better number on imagenet
 

4907
01:33:28,070 --> 01:33:29,560
not a better number on imagenet
classification it's like it's probably

4908
01:33:29,560 --> 01:33:29,570
classification it's like it's probably
 

4909
01:33:29,570 --> 01:33:31,150
classification it's like it's probably
like an actual thing that we can't do

4910
01:33:31,150 --> 01:33:31,160
like an actual thing that we can't do
 

4911
01:33:31,160 --> 01:33:32,020
like an actual thing that we can't do
today that would be really awesome

4912
01:33:32,020 --> 01:33:32,030
today that would be really awesome
 

4913
01:33:32,030 --> 01:33:35,770
today that would be really awesome
whether it's a robot Butler or a you

whether it's a robot Butler or a you
 

4915
01:33:35,780 --> 01:33:37,630

it is that you find inspiring and I

4920
01:33:41,830 --> 01:33:41,840
it is that you find inspiring and I
 

4921
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:43,360
it is that you find inspiring and I
think that thinking about that and then

4922
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:43,370
think that thinking about that and then
 

4923
01:33:43,370 --> 01:33:45,220
think that thinking about that and then
backtracking from there and imagining

4924
01:33:45,220 --> 01:33:45,230
backtracking from there and imagining
 

4925
01:33:45,230 --> 01:33:46,690
backtracking from there and imagining
the steps needed to get there will

4926
01:33:46,690 --> 01:33:46,700
the steps needed to get there will
 

4927
01:33:46,700 --> 01:33:48,310
the steps needed to get there will
actually do much better research it'll

4928
01:33:48,310 --> 01:33:48,320
actually do much better research it'll
 

4929
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:50,560
actually do much better research it'll
lead to rethinking the assumptions it'll

4930
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:50,570
lead to rethinking the assumptions it'll
 

4931
01:33:50,570 --> 01:33:53,290
lead to rethinking the assumptions it'll
lead to working on the bottlenecks other

4932
01:33:53,290 --> 01:33:53,300
lead to working on the bottlenecks other
 

4933
01:33:53,300 --> 01:33:56,020
lead to working on the bottlenecks other
other people aren't working on and then

4934
01:33:56,020 --> 01:33:56,030
other people aren't working on and then
 

4935
01:33:56,030 --> 01:33:58,510
other people aren't working on and then
naturally to turn to you we've talked

4936
01:33:58,510 --> 01:33:58,520
naturally to turn to you we've talked
 

4937
01:33:58,520 --> 01:34:01,000
naturally to turn to you we've talked
about reward functions and you just give

4938
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:01,010
about reward functions and you just give
 

4939
01:34:01,010 --> 01:34:03,430
about reward functions and you just give
an advice and looking forward I would

4940
01:34:03,430 --> 01:34:03,440
an advice and looking forward I would
 

4941
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:05,200
an advice and looking forward I would
like to see what kind of change you

4942
01:34:05,200 --> 01:34:05,210
like to see what kind of change you
 

4943
01:34:05,210 --> 01:34:07,000
like to see what kind of change you
would like to make in the world what do

4944
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:07,010
would like to make in the world what do
 

4945
01:34:07,010 --> 01:34:09,400
would like to make in the world what do
you think ridiculous big question what

4946
01:34:09,400 --> 01:34:09,410
you think ridiculous big question what
 

4947
01:34:09,410 --> 01:34:11,560
you think ridiculous big question what
do you think is the meaning of life what

4948
01:34:11,560 --> 01:34:11,570
do you think is the meaning of life what
 

4949
01:34:11,570 --> 01:34:13,780
do you think is the meaning of life what
is the meaning of your life what gives

4950
01:34:13,780 --> 01:34:13,790
is the meaning of your life what gives
 

4951
01:34:13,790 --> 01:34:17,650
is the meaning of your life what gives
you fulfillment purpose happiness and

4952
01:34:17,650 --> 01:34:17,660
you fulfillment purpose happiness and
 

4953
01:34:17,660 --> 01:34:23,580
you fulfillment purpose happiness and
meaning that's a very big question um

4954
01:34:23,580 --> 01:34:23,590
meaning that's a very big question um
 

4955
01:34:23,590 --> 01:34:26,530
meaning that's a very big question um
what's the reward function under which

4956
01:34:26,530 --> 01:34:26,540
what's the reward function under which
 

4957
01:34:26,540 --> 01:34:28,780
what's the reward function under which
you are operating yeah I think one thing

4958
01:34:28,780 --> 01:34:28,790
you are operating yeah I think one thing
 

4959
01:34:28,790 --> 01:34:30,910
you are operating yeah I think one thing
that does give you know if not meaning

4960
01:34:30,910 --> 01:34:30,920
that does give you know if not meaning
 

4961
01:34:30,920 --> 01:34:34,030
that does give you know if not meaning
at least satisfaction is some degree of

4962
01:34:34,030 --> 01:34:34,040
at least satisfaction is some degree of
 

4963
01:34:34,040 --> 01:34:36,010
at least satisfaction is some degree of
confidence that I'm working on a problem

4964
01:34:36,010 --> 01:34:36,020
confidence that I'm working on a problem
 

4965
01:34:36,020 --> 01:34:37,900
confidence that I'm working on a problem
that really matters I feel like it's

4966
01:34:37,900 --> 01:34:37,910
that really matters I feel like it's
 

4967
01:34:37,910 --> 01:34:40,030
that really matters I feel like it's
less important to me to like actually

4968
01:34:40,030 --> 01:34:40,040
less important to me to like actually
 

4969
01:34:40,040 --> 01:34:42,940
less important to me to like actually
solve a problem but it's it's quite nice

4970
01:34:42,940 --> 01:34:42,950
solve a problem but it's it's quite nice
 

4971
01:34:42,950 --> 01:34:47,200
solve a problem but it's it's quite nice
to take things to spend my time on that

4972
01:34:47,200 --> 01:34:47,210
to take things to spend my time on that
 

4973
01:34:47,210 --> 01:34:50,320
to take things to spend my time on that
I believe really matter and I I try

4974
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:50,330
I believe really matter and I I try
 

4975
01:34:50,330 --> 01:34:53,320
I believe really matter and I I try
pretty hard to to look for that I don't

4976
01:34:53,320 --> 01:34:53,330
pretty hard to to look for that I don't
 

4977
01:34:53,330 --> 01:34:55,180
pretty hard to to look for that I don't
know if it's easy to answer this but if

4978
01:34:55,180 --> 01:34:55,190
know if it's easy to answer this but if
 

4979
01:34:55,190 --> 01:34:58,900
know if it's easy to answer this but if
you're successful what does that look

4980
01:34:58,900 --> 01:34:58,910
you're successful what does that look
 

4981
01:34:58,910 --> 01:35:00,570
you're successful what does that look
like what's the

4982
01:35:00,570 --> 01:35:00,580
like what's the
 

4983
01:35:00,580 --> 01:35:04,110
like what's the
they dream enough of course success is

4984
01:35:04,110 --> 01:35:04,120
they dream enough of course success is
 

4985
01:35:04,120 --> 01:35:06,150
they dream enough of course success is
built on top of success and you keep

4986
01:35:06,150 --> 01:35:06,160
built on top of success and you keep
 

4987
01:35:06,160 --> 01:35:10,770
built on top of success and you keep
going forever but what is the dream yeah

4988
01:35:10,770 --> 01:35:10,780
going forever but what is the dream yeah
 

4989
01:35:10,780 --> 01:35:13,650
going forever but what is the dream yeah
so one very concrete thing or maybe as

4990
01:35:13,650 --> 01:35:13,660
so one very concrete thing or maybe as
 

4991
01:35:13,660 --> 01:35:14,940
so one very concrete thing or maybe as
concrete as it's gonna get

4992
01:35:14,940 --> 01:35:14,950
concrete as it's gonna get
 

4993
01:35:14,950 --> 01:35:18,930
concrete as it's gonna get
here is is to see machines that actually

4994
01:35:18,930 --> 01:35:18,940
here is is to see machines that actually
 

4995
01:35:18,940 --> 01:35:21,780
here is is to see machines that actually
get better and better the you know the

4996
01:35:21,780 --> 01:35:21,790
get better and better the you know the
 

4997
01:35:21,790 --> 01:35:23,580
get better and better the you know the
longer they exists in the world and that

4998
01:35:23,580 --> 01:35:23,590
longer they exists in the world and that
 

4999
01:35:23,590 --> 01:35:25,830
longer they exists in the world and that
kind of seems like on the surface one

5000
01:35:25,830 --> 01:35:25,840
kind of seems like on the surface one
 

5001
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:26,820
kind of seems like on the surface one
might even think that that's something

5002
01:35:26,820 --> 01:35:26,830
might even think that that's something
 

5003
01:35:26,830 --> 01:35:28,440
might even think that that's something
that we have today but I think we really

5004
01:35:28,440 --> 01:35:28,450
that we have today but I think we really
 

5005
01:35:28,450 --> 01:35:33,350
that we have today but I think we really
don't I think that there is unending

5006
01:35:33,350 --> 01:35:33,360
don't I think that there is unending
 

5007
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:37,470
don't I think that there is unending
complexity in the universe and to date

5008
01:35:37,470 --> 01:35:37,480
complexity in the universe and to date
 

5009
01:35:37,480 --> 01:35:39,090
complexity in the universe and to date
all the machines that we've been able to

5010
01:35:39,090 --> 01:35:39,100
all the machines that we've been able to
 

5011
01:35:39,100 --> 01:35:42,510
all the machines that we've been able to
build don't sort of improve up to the

5012
01:35:42,510 --> 01:35:42,520
build don't sort of improve up to the
 

5013
01:35:42,520 --> 01:35:44,460
build don't sort of improve up to the
limit of that complexity they they hit a

5014
01:35:44,460 --> 01:35:44,470
limit of that complexity they they hit a
 

5015
01:35:44,470 --> 01:35:46,050
limit of that complexity they they hit a
wall somewhere maybe they hit a wall

5016
01:35:46,050 --> 01:35:46,060
wall somewhere maybe they hit a wall
 

5017
01:35:46,060 --> 01:35:48,270
wall somewhere maybe they hit a wall
because they're in a simulator that has
