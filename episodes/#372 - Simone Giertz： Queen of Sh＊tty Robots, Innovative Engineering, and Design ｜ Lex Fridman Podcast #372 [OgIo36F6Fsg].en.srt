00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:10,340
stuff even before then I'm from Sweden
 

163
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:13,070
stuff even before then I'm from Sweden
and you have to choose either sewing or

164
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:13,080
and you have to choose either sewing or
 

165
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,809
and you have to choose either sewing or
Woodworking and I chose to like

166
00:03:14,809 --> 00:03:14,819
Woodworking and I chose to like
 

167
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,970
Woodworking and I chose to like
woodworking in middle school and I

168
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:16,980
woodworking in middle school and I
 

169
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,070
woodworking in middle school and I
remember the sense of Pride when I got

170
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:19,080
remember the sense of Pride when I got
 

171
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,809
remember the sense of Pride when I got
to bring something home and that thing

172
00:03:20,809 --> 00:03:20,819
to bring something home and that thing
 

173
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:22,430
to bring something home and that thing
of like oh my God I get to show my

174
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:22,440
of like oh my God I get to show my
 

175
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,869
of like oh my God I get to show my
parents this

176
00:03:23,869 --> 00:03:23,879
parents this
 

177
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:25,250
parents this
and

178
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:25,260
and
 

179
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:28,550
and
I think that is kind of the feeling that

180
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:28,560
I think that is kind of the feeling that
 

181
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,949
I think that is kind of the feeling that
I've built my job around it's like the

182
00:03:30,949 --> 00:03:30,959
I've built my job around it's like the
 

183
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,509
I've built my job around it's like the
sense of Pride and wanting to show

184
00:03:32,509 --> 00:03:32,519
sense of Pride and wanting to show
 

185
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:34,250
sense of Pride and wanting to show
people something that I made and like

186
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:34,260
people something that I made and like
 

187
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,170
people something that I made and like
back then it was like a little wooden

188
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:36,180
back then it was like a little wooden
 

189
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,790
back then it was like a little wooden
spoon you know

190
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:37,800
spoon you know
 

191
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,729
spoon you know
and now it's a slightly larger wooden

192
00:03:40,729 --> 00:03:40,739
and now it's a slightly larger wooden
 

193
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:43,670
and now it's a slightly larger wooden
wood spoon this Dynamic it moves and has

194
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:43,680
wood spoon this Dynamic it moves and has
 

195
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,830
wood spoon this Dynamic it moves and has
a mind of its own

196
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:45,840
a mind of its own
 

197
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,809
a mind of its own
um you first started doing more

198
00:03:47,809 --> 00:03:47,819
um you first started doing more
 

199
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:50,509
um you first started doing more
engineering type stuff with uh Arduino

200
00:03:50,509 --> 00:03:50,519
engineering type stuff with uh Arduino
 

201
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:54,350
engineering type stuff with uh Arduino
boards at punch to design which is an SF

202
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:54,360
boards at punch to design which is an SF
 

203
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,390
boards at punch to design which is an SF
engineering firm what are just from your

204
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:56,400
engineering firm what are just from your
 

205
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,589
engineering firm what are just from your
memory there what are some cool things

206
00:03:57,589 --> 00:03:57,599
memory there what are some cool things
 

207
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,110
memory there what are some cool things
you built there so the thing is I I went

208
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:00,120
you built there so the thing is I I went
 

209
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,250
you built there so the thing is I I went
to advertising school and I just like a

210
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:04,260
to advertising school and I just like a
 

211
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:07,070
to advertising school and I just like a
vocational studies a year and I realized

212
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:07,080
vocational studies a year and I realized
 

213
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,390
vocational studies a year and I realized
there that I didn't care much for

214
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:08,400
there that I didn't care much for
 

215
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,949
there that I didn't care much for
advertising but I thought it was really

216
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:09,959
advertising but I thought it was really
 

217
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:11,690
advertising but I thought it was really
fun to build stuff and programs so like

218
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:11,700
fun to build stuff and programs so like
 

219
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,690
fun to build stuff and programs so like
I just completely focused on that and

220
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:14,700
I just completely focused on that and
 

221
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,370
I just completely focused on that and
there I built

222
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:16,380
there I built
 

223
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,469
there I built
my first Hardware project or like

224
00:04:18,469 --> 00:04:18,479
my first Hardware project or like
 

225
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:21,289
my first Hardware project or like
Electronics project which was this uh

226
00:04:21,289 --> 00:04:21,299
Electronics project which was this uh
 

227
00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:22,969
Electronics project which was this uh
iPhone case with retractable guitar

228
00:04:22,969 --> 00:04:22,979
iPhone case with retractable guitar
 

229
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:25,310
iPhone case with retractable guitar
strings so basically I imagine that you

230
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:25,320
strings so basically I imagine that you
 

231
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,650
strings so basically I imagine that you
could like pull out guitar strings from

232
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:27,660
could like pull out guitar strings from
 

233
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,350
could like pull out guitar strings from
the bottom of your iPhone and you could

234
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:30,360
the bottom of your iPhone and you could
 

235
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,210
the bottom of your iPhone and you could
pluck it to your belt and then you could

236
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:32,220
pluck it to your belt and then you could
 

237
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,270
pluck it to your belt and then you could
hold a cord on the screen and I built

238
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:35,280
hold a cord on the screen and I built
 

239
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,770
hold a cord on the screen and I built
that together with my friend Jonathan

240
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:36,780
that together with my friend Jonathan
 

241
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:40,310
that together with my friend Jonathan
and I was like oh this is dope I thought

242
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:40,320
and I was like oh this is dope I thought
 

243
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,249
and I was like oh this is dope I thought
it was so much fun and I considered like

244
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:43,259
it was so much fun and I considered like
 

245
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:45,650
it was so much fun and I considered like
oh should I go to school for this but

246
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:45,660
oh should I go to school for this but
 

247
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,290
oh should I go to school for this but
then I thought maybe I can get a job and

248
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:48,300
then I thought maybe I can get a job and
 

249
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,450
then I thought maybe I can get a job and
I could get paid to learn about

250
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:50,460
I could get paid to learn about
 

251
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,629
I could get paid to learn about
Electronics so just based off of that

252
00:04:53,629 --> 00:04:53,639
Electronics so just based off of that
 

253
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:56,030
Electronics so just based off of that
one project I got the job at punch

254
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:56,040
one project I got the job at punch
 

255
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,650
one project I got the job at punch
through design there's actually was a

256
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:57,660
through design there's actually was a
 

257
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,810
through design there's actually was a
one year internship can you explain what

258
00:04:59,810 --> 00:04:59,820
one year internship can you explain what
 

259
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,050
one year internship can you explain what
we're talking about here so it's a case

260
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:02,060
we're talking about here so it's a case
 

261
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:05,030
we're talking about here so it's a case
with guitar strings attached yeah does

262
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:05,040
with guitar strings attached yeah does
 

263
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,909
with guitar strings attached yeah does
it actually work at all

264
00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:07,919
it actually work at all
 

265
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,409
it actually work at all
these are not on the screen guitar

266
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:09,419
these are not on the screen guitar
 

267
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:12,890
these are not on the screen guitar
strings no so they're actual strings

268
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:12,900
strings no so they're actual strings
 

269
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,749
strings no so they're actual strings
that you pull out so there's a mechanism

270
00:05:14,749 --> 00:05:14,759
that you pull out so there's a mechanism
 

271
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:16,810
that you pull out so there's a mechanism
that's almost like a seat belt mechanism

272
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:16,820
that's almost like a seat belt mechanism
 

273
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:20,090
that's almost like a seat belt mechanism
and yeah you pull them out from the

274
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:20,100
and yeah you pull them out from the
 

275
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,790
and yeah you pull them out from the
bottom of uh your phone and you can

276
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:22,800
bottom of uh your phone and you can
 

277
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,770
bottom of uh your phone and you can
attach them to your belt I mean it's

278
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:24,780
attach them to your belt I mean it's
 

279
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,330
attach them to your belt I mean it's
terrible

280
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:26,340
terrible
 

281
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:29,990
terrible
there's a few different ways to decide

282
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:30,000
there's a few different ways to decide
 

283
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,450
there's a few different ways to decide
if somebody's touching a guitar string

284
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:32,460
if somebody's touching a guitar string
 

285
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:35,270
if somebody's touching a guitar string
and what you do in a real guitar is you

286
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:35,280
and what you do in a real guitar is you
 

287
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,129
and what you do in a real guitar is you
have the little it's like measuring the

288
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:37,139
have the little it's like measuring the
 

289
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:39,770
have the little it's like measuring the
vibration or the change and the as as

290
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:39,780
vibration or the change and the as as
 

291
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,330
vibration or the change and the as as
the yeah you're measuring how the guitar

292
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:41,340
the yeah you're measuring how the guitar
 

293
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,070
the yeah you're measuring how the guitar
is vibrating and you can't really do

294
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:43,080
is vibrating and you can't really do
 

295
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,249
is vibrating and you can't really do
that because I can't have a a receiving

296
00:05:46,249 --> 00:05:46,259
that because I can't have a a receiving
 

297
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:48,770
that because I can't have a a receiving
sensor because the guitar strings are

298
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:48,780
sensor because the guitar strings are
 

299
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,330
sensor because the guitar strings are
going to move in relationship to that

300
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:50,340
going to move in relationship to that
 

301
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,129
going to move in relationship to that
because you don't have like a rigid neck

302
00:05:52,129 --> 00:05:52,139
because you don't have like a rigid neck
 

303
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:54,650
because you don't have like a rigid neck
and this is like yeah this was my first

304
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:54,660
and this is like yeah this was my first
 

305
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,990
and this is like yeah this was my first
Electronics project I was a little

306
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:57,000
Electronics project I was a little
 

307
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,010
Electronics project I was a little
fledging baby maker but what I decided

308
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:01,020
fledging baby maker but what I decided
 

309
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,990
fledging baby maker but what I decided
was to use capacitive touch

310
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:03,000
was to use capacitive touch
 

311
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,689
was to use capacitive touch
because that is independent on if the

312
00:06:05,689 --> 00:06:05,699
because that is independent on if the
 

313
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:06,890
because that is independent on if the
guitar strings are moving in

314
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:06,900
guitar strings are moving in
 

315
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,930
guitar strings are moving in
relationship to something or in relation

316
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:08,940
relationship to something or in relation
 

317
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:12,050
relationship to something or in relation
to something so basically there was just

318
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:12,060
to something so basically there was just
 

319
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,390
to something so basically there was just
this little Bluetooth Arduino board that

320
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:14,400
this little Bluetooth Arduino board that
 

321
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,890
this little Bluetooth Arduino board that
this company punched through design made

322
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:15,900
this company punched through design made
 

323
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,469
this company punched through design made
so that was how I found them and I

324
00:06:18,469 --> 00:06:18,479
so that was how I found them and I
 

325
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,450
so that was how I found them and I
measured the capacitive touch so like

326
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:20,460
measured the capacitive touch so like
 

327
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,189
measured the capacitive touch so like
whenever

328
00:06:22,189 --> 00:06:22,199
whenever
 

329
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:23,990
whenever
um the guitar string was measured there

330
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:24,000
um the guitar string was measured there
 

331
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,850
um the guitar string was measured there
was this little microcontroller that was

332
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:25,860
was this little microcontroller that was
 

333
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,170
was this little microcontroller that was
like oh my God a guitar string got

334
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:27,180
like oh my God a guitar string got
 

335
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:31,249
like oh my God a guitar string got
measured or touched and then that sent a

336
00:06:31,249 --> 00:06:31,259
measured or touched and then that sent a
 

337
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:35,450
measured or touched and then that sent a
signal over Bluetooth to my phone and I

338
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:35,460
signal over Bluetooth to my phone and I
 

339
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,770
signal over Bluetooth to my phone and I
built a little iPhone app that

340
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:36,780
built a little iPhone app that
 

341
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,510
built a little iPhone app that
interpreted those Bluetooth signals and

342
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:38,520
interpreted those Bluetooth signals and
 

343
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,670
interpreted those Bluetooth signals and
then checked what type of cord I was

344
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:40,680
then checked what type of cord I was
 

345
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,010
then checked what type of cord I was
holding on the screen and then played

346
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:43,020
holding on the screen and then played
 

347
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,290
holding on the screen and then played
the code here I see holding the chords

348
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:45,300
the code here I see holding the chords
 

349
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,270
the code here I see holding the chords
on the screen so you're doing the

350
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:47,280
on the screen so you're doing the
 

351
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,969
on the screen so you're doing the
multi-touch sensing there

352
00:06:49,969 --> 00:06:49,979
multi-touch sensing there
 

353
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:53,510
multi-touch sensing there
that's incredible I honestly cannot

354
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:53,520
that's incredible I honestly cannot
 

355
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,010
that's incredible I honestly cannot
believe that I pulled it off because I

356
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:55,020
believe that I pulled it off because I
 

357
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,529
believe that I pulled it off because I
think I was I was ignorance was

358
00:06:57,529 --> 00:06:57,539
think I was I was ignorance was
 

359
00:06:57,539 --> 00:06:59,629
think I was I was ignorance was
definitely Bliss because that was like

360
00:06:59,629 --> 00:06:59,639
definitely Bliss because that was like
 

361
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:02,689
definitely Bliss because that was like
yeah the first Hardware

362
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:02,699
yeah the first Hardware
 

363
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:04,730
yeah the first Hardware
project I'd ever built the first iPhone

364
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:04,740
project I'd ever built the first iPhone
 

365
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:08,090
project I'd ever built the first iPhone
app I'd ever programmed and like now if

366
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:08,100
app I'd ever programmed and like now if
 

367
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,770
app I'd ever programmed and like now if
somebody was like Hey I want this to be

368
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:09,780
somebody was like Hey I want this to be
 

369
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,029
somebody was like Hey I want this to be
my first project I would probably be

370
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:11,039
my first project I would probably be
 

371
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,309
my first project I would probably be
like oh that's a lot but

372
00:07:13,309 --> 00:07:13,319
like oh that's a lot but
 

373
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:16,129
like oh that's a lot but
we'll get off because that's such an

374
00:07:16,129 --> 00:07:16,139
we'll get off because that's such an
 

375
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:17,270
we'll get off because that's such an
interesting thing

376
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:17,280
interesting thing
 

377
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,890
interesting thing
for people to hear because it's your

378
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:18,900
for people to hear because it's your
 

379
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,589
for people to hear because it's your
first project and a lot of people stop

380
00:07:21,589 --> 00:07:21,599
first project and a lot of people stop
 

381
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,450
first project and a lot of people stop
because of the difficulty of their first

382
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:23,460
because of the difficulty of their first
 

383
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,189
because of the difficulty of their first
project they never truly discovered

384
00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:25,199
project they never truly discovered
 

385
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,570
project they never truly discovered
their own genius because they stopped

386
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:26,580
their own genius because they stopped
 

387
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,490
their own genius because they stopped
with the first and you didn't stop so

388
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:28,500
with the first and you didn't stop so
 

389
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,010
with the first and you didn't stop so
it'd be interesting to kind of

390
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:30,020
it'd be interesting to kind of
 

391
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:32,029
it'd be interesting to kind of
psychoanalyze you on the couch of why

392
00:07:32,029 --> 00:07:32,039
psychoanalyze you on the couch of why
 

393
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:33,830
psychoanalyze you on the couch of why
you didn't stop because you have to

394
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:33,840
you didn't stop because you have to
 

395
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,870
you didn't stop because you have to
build an app you have to figure out how

396
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:35,880
build an app you have to figure out how
 

397
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,029
build an app you have to figure out how
to did you know how to program much or

398
00:07:38,029 --> 00:07:38,039
to did you know how to program much or
 

399
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:40,670
to did you know how to program much or
no okay I mean a little bit but I never

400
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:40,680
no okay I mean a little bit but I never
 

401
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,270
no okay I mean a little bit but I never
programmed and or done any iOS apps okay

402
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:44,280
programmed and or done any iOS apps okay
 

403
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,029
programmed and or done any iOS apps okay
so you have to figure out how to get

404
00:07:46,029 --> 00:07:46,039
so you have to figure out how to get
 

405
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:48,409
so you have to figure out how to get
forget like what the app does just get

406
00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:48,419
forget like what the app does just get
 

407
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:50,930
forget like what the app does just get
the app running and working and then you

408
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:50,940
the app running and working and then you
 

409
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:51,890
the app running and working and then you
have to figure out how to get the

410
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:51,900
have to figure out how to get the
 

411
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,469
have to figure out how to get the
sensors in like real time to finger

412
00:07:54,469 --> 00:07:54,479
sensors in like real time to finger
 

413
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,210
sensors in like real time to finger
touching and you have to connect how to

414
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:56,220
touching and you have to connect how to
 

415
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,370
touching and you have to connect how to
get the capacitor's touch working with

416
00:07:58,370 --> 00:07:58,380
get the capacitor's touch working with
 

417
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,930
get the capacitor's touch working with
the microcontrollers do you know

418
00:07:59,930 --> 00:07:59,940
the microcontrollers do you know
 

419
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,490
the microcontrollers do you know
anything about the capacitor touch

420
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:01,500
anything about the capacitor touch
 

421
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,589
anything about the capacitor touch
sensors at that time I mean it's pretty

422
00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:03,599
sensors at that time I mean it's pretty
 

423
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:04,670
sensors at that time I mean it's pretty
easy

424
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:04,680
easy
 

425
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,469
easy
um now it's basically everything's easy

426
00:08:06,469 --> 00:08:06,479
um now it's basically everything's easy
 

427
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,710
um now it's basically everything's easy
yeah you know Rockets are pretty easy

428
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:09,720
yeah you know Rockets are pretty easy
 

429
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,930
yeah you know Rockets are pretty easy
you sound like my grandma she's I have

430
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:11,940
you sound like my grandma she's I have
 

431
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:15,230
you sound like my grandma she's I have
an Italian grandma and uh I always

432
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:15,240
an Italian grandma and uh I always
 

433
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,909
an Italian grandma and uh I always
trying to get her we're like trying to

434
00:08:16,909 --> 00:08:16,919
trying to get her we're like trying to
 

435
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:19,670
trying to get her we're like trying to
get her to tell her recipes and every

436
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:19,680
get her to tell her recipes and every
 

437
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,589
get her to tell her recipes and every
recipe starts with

438
00:08:21,589 --> 00:08:21,599
recipe starts with
 

439
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,930
recipe starts with
it's very simple yeah and then there's

440
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:23,940
it's very simple yeah and then there's
 

441
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,850
it's very simple yeah and then there's
like 45 minutes of her explaining it

442
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:25,860
like 45 minutes of her explaining it
 

443
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,249
like 45 minutes of her explaining it
it's like with gymnastics at the

444
00:08:28,249 --> 00:08:28,259
it's like with gymnastics at the
 

445
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:31,189
it's like with gymnastics at the
Olympics they make it look easy the best

446
00:08:31,189 --> 00:08:31,199
Olympics they make it look easy the best
 

447
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,930
Olympics they make it look easy the best
people in the world always make the the

448
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:32,940
people in the world always make the the
 

449
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,089
people in the world always make the the
impossible to seem easy I pride myself

450
00:08:35,089 --> 00:08:35,099
impossible to seem easy I pride myself
 

451
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:37,250
impossible to seem easy I pride myself
with making buildings that look really

452
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:37,260
with making buildings that look really
 

453
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,350
with making buildings that look really
hard because I feel like I'm always

454
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:39,360
hard because I feel like I'm always
 

455
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,329
hard because I feel like I'm always
struggling so much you make the easiest

456
00:08:41,329 --> 00:08:41,339
struggling so much you make the easiest
 

457
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:43,850
struggling so much you make the easiest
human possible no uh

458
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:43,860
human possible no uh
 

459
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,970
human possible no uh
so how many strings was it is it just oh

460
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:46,980
so how many strings was it is it just oh
 

461
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,290
so how many strings was it is it just oh
gosh I think this is such a long time

462
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:48,300
gosh I think this is such a long time
 

463
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,690
gosh I think this is such a long time
ago no it was six oh six strings and you

464
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:50,700
ago no it was six oh six strings and you
 

465
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,430
ago no it was six oh six strings and you
could touch it and then there's

466
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:52,440
could touch it and then there's
 

467
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,030
could touch it and then there's
wow and it can and then the phone itself

468
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:56,040
wow and it can and then the phone itself
 

469
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,790
wow and it can and then the phone itself
makes a sound

470
00:08:58,790 --> 00:08:58,800

 

471
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,269

still think it's such a cool concept to

472
00:09:02,269 --> 00:09:02,279
still think it's such a cool concept to
 

473
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:04,250
still think it's such a cool concept to
have this like mobile I'm not even a

474
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:04,260
have this like mobile I'm not even a
 

475
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,170
have this like mobile I'm not even a
guitar player I don't know I was I mean

476
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:06,180
guitar player I don't know I was I mean
 

477
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,810
guitar player I don't know I was I mean
I got the idea because I was uh kind of

478
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:08,820
I got the idea because I was uh kind of
 

479
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,389
I got the idea because I was uh kind of
strumming on my charge cord of my phone

480
00:09:11,389 --> 00:09:11,399
strumming on my charge cord of my phone
 

481
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:17,509
strumming on my charge cord of my phone
oh like an air guitar but on a cord yeah

482
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:17,519

 

483
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,870

fun to go back to that project with what

484
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:20,880
fun to go back to that project with what
 

485
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,889
fun to go back to that project with what
I know now but the problem with it is

486
00:09:24,889 --> 00:09:24,899
I know now but the problem with it is
 

487
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:27,769
I know now but the problem with it is
that when you're producing the tension

488
00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:27,779
that when you're producing the tension
 

489
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:30,350
that when you're producing the tension
in your string just with your arm like

490
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:30,360
in your string just with your arm like
 

491
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,449
in your string just with your arm like
you can't make it taut enough to

492
00:09:32,449 --> 00:09:32,459
you can't make it taut enough to
 

493
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:34,370
you can't make it taut enough to
actually play like it kind of becomes

494
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:34,380
actually play like it kind of becomes
 

495
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:37,310
actually play like it kind of becomes
playing these like saggy strings so as

496
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:37,320
playing these like saggy strings so as
 

497
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,930
playing these like saggy strings so as
you're not really getting that

498
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:38,940
you're not really getting that
 

499
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,449
you're not really getting that
experience and I think that's why I mean

500
00:09:41,449 --> 00:09:41,459
experience and I think that's why I mean
 

501
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:42,410
experience and I think that's why I mean
I

502
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:42,420
I
 

503
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,389
I
yeah I haven't really pursued I wonder

504
00:09:44,389 --> 00:09:44,399
yeah I haven't really pursued I wonder
 

505
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,710
yeah I haven't really pursued I wonder
if there's a way to generate the

506
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:45,720
if there's a way to generate the
 

507
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,850
if there's a way to generate the
tightness

508
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:46,860
tightness
 

509
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,889
tightness
from the case itself

510
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:48,899
from the case itself
 

511
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:50,990
from the case itself
it's a good device that unfolds and then

512
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:51,000
it's a good device that unfolds and then
 

513
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,570
it's a good device that unfolds and then
with some kind of tightening mechanisms

514
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:53,580
with some kind of tightening mechanisms
 

515
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,910
with some kind of tightening mechanisms
yeah but then it kind of becomes like a

516
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:55,920
yeah but then it kind of becomes like a
 

517
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,829
yeah but then it kind of becomes like a
whole thing in a guitar then it just

518
00:09:57,829 --> 00:09:57,839
whole thing in a guitar then it just
 

519
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,930
whole thing in a guitar then it just
becomes a really shitty guitar yeah like

520
00:09:59,930 --> 00:09:59,940
becomes a really shitty guitar yeah like
 

521
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,150
becomes a really shitty guitar yeah like
which this is a really shitty guitar but

522
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:02,160
which this is a really shitty guitar but
 

523
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,490
which this is a really shitty guitar but
it's also but it's so shitty it's

524
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:04,500
it's also but it's so shitty it's
 

525
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,829
it's also but it's so shitty it's
awesome yeah I don't know I don't know

526
00:10:06,829 --> 00:10:06,839
awesome yeah I don't know I don't know
 

527
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:08,690
awesome yeah I don't know I don't know
but it's a cool it's cool that you have

528
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:08,700
but it's a cool it's cool that you have
 

529
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,150
but it's a cool it's cool that you have
an interface between

530
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:11,160
an interface between
 

531
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,670
an interface between
a device that's capable of incredible

532
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:13,680
a device that's capable of incredible
 

533
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,710
a device that's capable of incredible
computational power and an actual

534
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:15,720
computational power and an actual
 

535
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,410
computational power and an actual
Hardware thing is there something that

536
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:18,420
Hardware thing is there something that
 

537
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,150
Hardware thing is there something that
you can psychoanalize

538
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:20,160
you can psychoanalize
 

539
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,670
you can psychoanalize
that made you finish that others could

540
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:22,680
that made you finish that others could
 

541
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,389
that made you finish that others could
hear

542
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:23,399
hear
 

543
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:26,210
hear
in their own struggle to uh

544
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:26,220
in their own struggle to uh
 

545
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,130
in their own struggle to uh
do their first project like that because

546
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:28,140
do their first project like that because
 

547
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,329
do their first project like that because
you were not you were in a

548
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:29,339
you were not you were in a
 

549
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:31,910
you were not you were in a
non-engineering person technically

550
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:31,920
non-engineering person technically
 

551
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,590
non-engineering person technically
and you did a pretty cool Renegade out

552
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:36,600
and you did a pretty cool Renegade out
 

553
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,610
and you did a pretty cool Renegade out
there

554
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:37,620
there
 

555
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,430
there
wild no instructions

556
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:40,440
wild no instructions
 

557
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,250
wild no instructions
engineering projects no it's definitely

558
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:43,260
engineering projects no it's definitely
 

559
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,410
engineering projects no it's definitely
it was an off-road build where it's like

560
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:45,420
it was an off-road build where it's like
 

561
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,030
it was an off-road build where it's like
if you're building a Lego kit it's very

562
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:47,040
if you're building a Lego kit it's very
 

563
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,949
if you're building a Lego kit it's very
much on the road and you're following

564
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:48,959
much on the road and you're following
 

565
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,810
much on the road and you're following
instructions and this is like you have

566
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:50,820
instructions and this is like you have
 

567
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,610
instructions and this is like you have
no idea if you're headed for a cliff or

568
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:52,620
no idea if you're headed for a cliff or
 

569
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,370
no idea if you're headed for a cliff or
a dead end or you're gonna get stuck

570
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:55,380
a dead end or you're gonna get stuck
 

571
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:59,269
a dead end or you're gonna get stuck
um I think it had a natural pressure to

572
00:10:59,269 --> 00:10:59,279
um I think it had a natural pressure to
 

573
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,370
um I think it had a natural pressure to
it because it was a school project yeah

574
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:01,380
it because it was a school project yeah
 

575
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:04,130
it because it was a school project yeah
so it did have deadlines built into it

576
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:04,140
so it did have deadlines built into it
 

577
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,870
so it did have deadlines built into it
and and stuff like that so that

578
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:05,880
and and stuff like that so that
 

579
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,449
and and stuff like that so that
definitely helped but I think also it

580
00:11:08,449 --> 00:11:08,459
definitely helped but I think also it
 

581
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:11,810
definitely helped but I think also it
was just so incredibly motivating when I

582
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:11,820
was just so incredibly motivating when I
 

583
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,250
was just so incredibly motivating when I
realized that I might be able to pull it

584
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:13,260
realized that I might be able to pull it
 

585
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,150
realized that I might be able to pull it
off

586
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:14,160
off
 

587
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,190
off
like that was I felt like a bloodhound

588
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:16,200
like that was I felt like a bloodhound
 

589
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,230
like that was I felt like a bloodhound
you know and you're just like oh my God

590
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:18,240
you know and you're just like oh my God
 

591
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,910
you know and you're just like oh my God
I can actually make this happen and I

592
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:19,920
I can actually make this happen and I
 

593
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,889
I can actually make this happen and I
think if

594
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:21,899
think if
 

595
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:25,130
think if
I hadn't seen that the Horizon it would

596
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:25,140
I hadn't seen that the Horizon it would
 

597
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,530
I hadn't seen that the Horizon it would
have been harder to stick through you

598
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:27,540
have been harder to stick through you
 

599
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,730
have been harder to stick through you
were you able to see the end of the

600
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:28,740
were you able to see the end of the
 

601
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,530
were you able to see the end of the
tunnel um

602
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:30,540
tunnel um
 

603
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:33,370
tunnel um
pretty early on no not really

604
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:33,380
pretty early on no not really
 

605
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:36,230
pretty early on no not really
so there's something just suffering for

606
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:36,240
so there's something just suffering for
 

607
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,389
so there's something just suffering for
a while I don't know how how your brain

608
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:38,399
a while I don't know how how your brain
 

609
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,470
a while I don't know how how your brain
works but it's like if I have a problem

610
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:42,480
works but it's like if I have a problem
 

611
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,470
works but it's like if I have a problem
I can't stop thinking about it like it's

612
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:45,480
I can't stop thinking about it like it's
 

613
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,710
I can't stop thinking about it like it's
so fun to think about it like I spent I

614
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:48,720
so fun to think about it like I spent I
 

615
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,850
so fun to think about it like I spent I
spent

616
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:49,860
spent
 

617
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:53,810
spent
two and a half years designing a coat

618
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:53,820
two and a half years designing a coat
 

619
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,329
two and a half years designing a coat
hanger

620
00:11:56,329 --> 00:11:56,339

 

621
00:11:56,339 --> 00:11:58,670

and I just can't stop thinking about it

622
00:11:58,670 --> 00:11:58,680
and I just can't stop thinking about it
 

623
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,009
and I just can't stop thinking about it
like I get so into it because I think

624
00:12:01,009 --> 00:12:01,019
like I get so into it because I think
 

625
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:02,509
like I get so into it because I think
it's so much fun

626
00:12:02,509 --> 00:12:02,519
it's so much fun
 

627
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:04,610
it's so much fun
take me to this

628
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:04,620
take me to this
 

629
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,470
take me to this
two-year journey of the code hanging out

630
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:06,480
two-year journey of the code hanging out
 

631
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,410
two-year journey of the code hanging out
of the code hanger what how did it begin

632
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:09,420
of the code hanger what how did it begin
 

633
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,870
of the code hanger what how did it begin
how did it begin it began with a corner

634
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:11,880
how did it begin it began with a corner
 

635
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,449
how did it begin it began with a corner
in my home where I couldn't fit a coat

636
00:12:14,449 --> 00:12:14,459
in my home where I couldn't fit a coat
 

637
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:15,949
in my home where I couldn't fit a coat
rack the thing is I shouldn't have

638
00:12:15,949 --> 00:12:15,959
rack the thing is I shouldn't have
 

639
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:17,750

I'm kind of
going into two different Avenues one is

00:13:18,949 --> 00:13:18,959
going into two different Avenues one is
 

691
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,230
going into two different Avenues one is
the product business that I started code

692
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:21,240
the product business that I started code
 

693
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,329
the product business that I started code
hinders TBD

694
00:13:23,329 --> 00:13:23,339
hinders TBD
 

695
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:26,150
hinders TBD
um and then I am working on a pilot

696
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:26,160
um and then I am working on a pilot
 

697
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,670
um and then I am working on a pilot
episode of a show where each episode is

698
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:28,680
episode of a show where each episode is
 

699
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,350
episode of a show where each episode is
about an everyday object and why they

700
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:30,360
about an everyday object and why they
 

701
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,210
about an everyday object and why they
look the way that they do so we've

702
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:32,220
look the way that they do so we've
 

703
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,370
look the way that they do so we've
written a pilot episode about forks and

704
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:34,380
written a pilot episode about forks and
 

705
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,949
written a pilot episode about forks and
it's all about like why do they look the

706
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:36,959
it's all about like why do they look the
 

707
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,930
it's all about like why do they look the
way that they do why did this became the

708
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:38,940
way that they do why did this became the
 

709
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,569
way that they do why did this became the
like eating Implement of the West why

710
00:13:41,569 --> 00:13:41,579
like eating Implement of the West why
 

711
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:43,850
like eating Implement of the West why
are we ruled by an iron Fork how did

712
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:43,860
are we ruled by an iron Fork how did
 

713
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,650
are we ruled by an iron Fork how did
that happen in every everyday object

714
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:45,660
that happen in every everyday object
 

715
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,870
that happen in every everyday object
that you have and that you just take for

716
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:47,880
that you have and that you just take for
 

717
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,030
that you have and that you just take for
granted somebody's just made it up yeah

718
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:50,040
granted somebody's just made it up yeah
 

719
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,550
granted somebody's just made it up yeah
we're all sheep well I'll keep using it

720
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:52,560
we're all sheep well I'll keep using it
 

721
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,850
we're all sheep well I'll keep using it
yeah even if it's not optimal I mean

722
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:54,860
yeah even if it's not optimal I mean
 

723
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:57,470
yeah even if it's not optimal I mean
presumably most objects are optimal you

724
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:57,480
presumably most objects are optimal you
 

725
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,710
presumably most objects are optimal you
hope or at least a local options yeah

726
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:00,720
hope or at least a local options yeah
 

727
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,690
hope or at least a local options yeah
and that's what I think is so like the

728
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:02,700
and that's what I think is so like the
 

729
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,430
and that's what I think is so like the
world around us and this is why I love

730
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:04,440
world around us and this is why I love
 

731
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,889
world around us and this is why I love
building things is because it just opens

732
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:06,899
building things is because it just opens
 

733
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:08,690
building things is because it just opens
up this idea that the world around us is

734
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:08,700
up this idea that the world around us is
 

735
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,250
up this idea that the world around us is
so malleable

736
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:10,260
so malleable
 

737
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,050
so malleable
can make objects work for you better

738
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:12,060
can make objects work for you better
 

739
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:15,110
can make objects work for you better
like I spent I I made this fruit bowl I

740
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:15,120
like I spent I I made this fruit bowl I
 

741
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,610
like I spent I I made this fruit bowl I
had a fruit bowl and I was always

742
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:16,620
had a fruit bowl and I was always
 

743
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,889
had a fruit bowl and I was always
annoyed that I had either too little or

744
00:14:18,889 --> 00:14:18,899
annoyed that I had either too little or
 

745
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:21,470
annoyed that I had either too little or
too much fruit for it so I made a fruit

746
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:21,480
too much fruit for it so I made a fruit
 

747
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,150
too much fruit for it so I made a fruit
bowl where I can change the diameter of

748
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:23,160
bowl where I can change the diameter of
 

749
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,470
bowl where I can change the diameter of
it it has a mechanism so you can like

750
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:24,480
it it has a mechanism so you can like
 

751
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,509
it it has a mechanism so you can like
make it bigger or smaller and that's

752
00:14:26,509 --> 00:14:26,519
make it bigger or smaller and that's
 

753
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:28,690
make it bigger or smaller and that's
just like the thing of being like

754
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:28,700
just like the thing of being like
 

755
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,490
just like the thing of being like
bowls why are they the way that they are

756
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:31,500
bowls why are they the way that they are
 

757
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,470
bowls why are they the way that they are
I can make them different and I think

758
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:33,480
I can make them different and I think
 

759
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,090
I can make them different and I think
like I want to make an episode about

760
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:35,100
like I want to make an episode about
 

761
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,829
like I want to make an episode about
doorknobs I think it's so interesting

762
00:14:36,829 --> 00:14:36,839
doorknobs I think it's so interesting
 

763
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:38,269
doorknobs I think it's so interesting
why are they the way they are why are

764
00:14:38,269 --> 00:14:38,279
why are they the way they are why are
 

765
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:40,850
why are they the way they are why are
they placed the way where they are I

766
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:40,860
they placed the way where they are I
 

767
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,410
they placed the way where they are I
think there's going to be a rabbit hole

768
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:42,420
think there's going to be a rabbit hole
 

769
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,389
think there's going to be a rabbit hole
from which you will never return I would

770
00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:44,399
from which you will never return I would
 

771
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,970
from which you will never return I would
happily live in that rabbit hole forever

772
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:46,980
happily live in that rabbit hole forever
 

773
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:50,689
happily live in that rabbit hole forever
like if I could if I can like dig out a

774
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:50,699
like if I could if I can like dig out a
 

775
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:52,910
like if I could if I can like dig out a
little niche for myself there because I

776
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:52,920
little niche for myself there because I
 

777
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,430
little niche for myself there because I
think it's like

778
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:55,440
think it's like
 

779
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,470
think it's like
because you know they go so deep they're

780
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:57,480
because you know they go so deep they're
 

781
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,810
because you know they go so deep they're
also on different sides of doors you

782
00:14:59,810 --> 00:14:59,820
also on different sides of doors you
 

783
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,970
also on different sides of doors you
never like the push-pull situation on

784
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:01,980
never like the push-pull situation on
 

785
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,670
never like the push-pull situation on
doors in general like that's one of the

786
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:04,680
doors in general like that's one of the
 

787
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,810
doors in general like that's one of the
main problems of humanity

788
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:07,820
main problems of humanity
 

789
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:10,730
main problems of humanity
figuring out which is embarrassing yeah

790
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:10,740
figuring out which is embarrassing yeah
 

791
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,410
figuring out which is embarrassing yeah

studied physics for a year in college
 

915
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:49,130

1079
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:53,390
I think it's probably the hardest when
you're starting out yeah because

1080
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:53,400
you're starting out yeah because
 

1081

you're starting out yeah because
I think it was easy

00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:18,480
feel like all scientific papers and
 

1315
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,610
feel like all scientific papers and
projects should go through that exercise

1316
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:21,620
projects should go through that exercise
 

1317

job of this like you know this we've saw
protein folding here's a gif that's

1322
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:29,520
protein folding here's a gif that's
 

1323
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,190
protein folding here's a gif that's
literally what they do yeah because

1324
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:31,200
literally what they do yeah because
 

1325
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,409
literally what they do yeah because
who's gonna read the nature paper so

1326
00:25:33,409 --> 00:25:33,419
who's gonna read the nature paper so
 

1327
00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:36,049
who's gonna read the nature paper so
like this you have to like how do we

1328
00:25:36,049 --> 00:25:36,059
like this you have to like how do we
 

1329
00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:38,810
like this you have to like how do we
communicate this visually in a sexy

1330
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:38,820
communicate this visually in a sexy
 

1331
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,669

1335
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,610
understand even if you don't know what a
protein is even if you don't know what

1336
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:43,620
protein is even if you don't know what
 

1337
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:46,789
protein is even if you don't know what
protein folding is yeah it's very like

1338
00:25:46,789 --> 00:25:46,799
protein folding is yeah it's very like
 

1339
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,950
protein folding is yeah it's very like
yeah if somebody comes out of context

1340
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:48,960
yeah if somebody comes out of context

created so this is when I was at punch
 

1389
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,510
created so this is when I was at punch
through design in San Francisco I would

1390
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:44,520
through design in San Francisco I would
 

1391
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,830
through design in San Francisco I would
kind of building a lot of Hardware

1392
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:45,840
kind of building a lot of Hardware
 

1393
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,409
kind of building a lot of Hardware
projects for them but I also felt and

1394
00:26:48,409 --> 00:26:48,419
projects for them but I also felt and
 

1395
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:51,110
projects for them but I also felt and
they were so supportive of me but I also

it's such a different way representing a
 

1399
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,010
it's such a different way representing a
brand versus representing yourself so

1400
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:55,020
brand versus representing yourself so
 

1401
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,390
brand versus representing yourself so
there were some projects that I just

1402
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:56,400
there were some projects that I just
 

1403
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,130
there were some projects that I just
like ruled out because I was like this

1404
00:26:58,130 --> 00:26:58,140
like ruled out because I was like this
 

1405
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,350
like ruled out because I was like this
feels too weird for this brand

1406
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:00,360
feels too weird for this brand
 

1407
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,210
feels too weird for this brand
and I started building them on the side

00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:02,220
and I started building them on the side
 

1409
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,909

video you uploaded it was the first gift
that I uploaded so actually I wanted to

1422
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:20,460
that I uploaded so actually I wanted to
 

1423
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,730
that I uploaded so actually I wanted to
um I wanted to do a kids show about

1424
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:22,740
um I wanted to do a kids show about
 

1425
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,890
um I wanted to do a kids show about
Electronics in Sweden because I was like

1426
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:24,900
Electronics in Sweden because I was like
 

1427
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,750
Electronics in Sweden because I was like
I love Electronics I think it's [\h__\h]

1428
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:26,760
I love Electronics I think it's [\h__\h]
 

1429
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:30,470
I love Electronics I think it's [\h__\h]
dope I could do a kids show about it so

1430
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:30,480
dope I could do a kids show about it so
 

1431
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:35,390
dope I could do a kids show about it so
I filmed this terrible terrible pilot

1432
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:35,400
I filmed this terrible terrible pilot
 

1433
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:39,409
I filmed this terrible terrible pilot
episode in my bedroom in San Francisco

1434
00:27:39,409 --> 00:27:39,419
episode in my bedroom in San Francisco
 

1435
00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:41,690
episode in my bedroom in San Francisco
and that's when I built the toothbrush

1436
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:41,700
and that's when I built the toothbrush
 

1437
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,430
and that's when I built the toothbrush
helmet and I emailed it to them I mean

1438
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:43,440
helmet and I emailed it to them I mean
 

1439
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,649
helmet and I emailed it to them I mean
just cold email like I'd know in or

1440
00:27:45,649 --> 00:27:45,659
just cold email like I'd know in or
 

1441
00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:47,090
just cold email like I'd know in or
anything but I was like Hey I want to do

1442
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:47,100
anything but I was like Hey I want to do
 

1443
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,070
anything but I was like Hey I want to do
this and

1444
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:49,080
this and
 

1445
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,169
this and
um they didn't get back to me nobody's

1446
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:51,179
um they didn't get back to me nobody's
 

1447
00:27:51,179 --> 00:27:53,149
um they didn't get back to me nobody's
surprised and I was like well I have

1448
00:27:53,149 --> 00:27:53,159
surprised and I was like well I have
 

1449
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:54,289
surprised and I was like well I have
this

1450
00:27:54,289 --> 00:27:54,299
this
 

1451
00:27:54,299 --> 00:27:56,269
this
thing I built I might as well post it on

1452
00:27:56,269 --> 00:27:56,279
thing I built I might as well post it on
 

1453
00:27:56,279 --> 00:27:57,649
thing I built I might as well post it on
the internet so that's why I made the

1454
00:27:57,649 --> 00:27:57,659
the internet so that's why I made the
 

1455
00:27:57,659 --> 00:27:59,750
the internet so that's why I made the
little GIF and I posted it on slash I do

1456
00:27:59,750 --> 00:27:59,760
little GIF and I posted it on slash I do
 

1457
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,029
little GIF and I posted it on slash I do
robots and I think it got like 50 000

1458
00:28:02,029 --> 00:28:02,039
robots and I think it got like 50 000
 

1459
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:05,390
robots and I think it got like 50 000
views and I was like Wow and from there

1460
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:05,400
views and I was like Wow and from there
 

1461
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,610
views and I was like Wow and from there
I just kept on building things and I

1462
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:07,620
I just kept on building things and I
 

1463
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,169
I just kept on building things and I
think Within

1464
00:28:09,169 --> 00:28:09,179
think Within
 

1465
00:28:09,179 --> 00:28:11,510
think Within
six months it was my full-time job can

1466
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:11,520
six months it was my full-time job can
 

1467
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,909
six months it was my full-time job can
you go through the detailed design of

1468
00:28:13,909 --> 00:28:13,919
you go through the detailed design of
 

1469
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:17,390
you go through the detailed design of
this toothbrush helmet there's a motor

1470
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:17,400
this toothbrush helmet there's a motor
 

1471
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,190
this toothbrush helmet there's a motor
it's like a server like what what uh

1472
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:19,200
it's like a server like what what uh
 

1473
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,750
it's like a server like what what uh
what's the motor what's the is an

1474
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:20,760
what's the motor what's the is an
 

1475
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,750
what's the motor what's the is an
Arduino involved yeah so I built it off

1476
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:23,760
Arduino involved yeah so I built it off
 

1477
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,649
Arduino involved yeah so I built it off
of

1478
00:28:24,649 --> 00:28:24,659
of
 

1479
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:27,350
of
um this robot arm called me arm

1480
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:27,360
um this robot arm called me arm
 

1481
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,950
um this robot arm called me arm
so it's just this acrylic robot arm

1482
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:30,960
so it's just this acrylic robot arm
 

1483
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,570
so it's just this acrylic robot arm
and

1484
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:32,580
and
 

1485
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:35,450
and
um I think it has three Servo Motors

1486
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:35,460
um I think it has three Servo Motors
 

1487
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,250
um I think it has three Servo Motors
and it's all controlled by an Arduino

1488
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:37,260
and it's all controlled by an Arduino
 

1489
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,930
and it's all controlled by an Arduino
all the electronics already pre-built

1490
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:38,940
all the electronics already pre-built
 

1491
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:41,870
all the electronics already pre-built
there was a kit so I assembled it how do

1492
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:41,880
there was a kit so I assembled it how do
 

1493
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:45,190
there was a kit so I assembled it how do
you make sure the the length of the arm

1494
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:45,200
you make sure the the length of the arm
 

1495
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,950
you make sure the the length of the arm
is the proper I mean the arm came down

1496
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:48,960
is the proper I mean the arm came down
 

1497
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,110
is the proper I mean the arm came down
so it's like yeah I just programmed it

1498
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:51,120
so it's like yeah I just programmed it
 

1499
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,870
so it's like yeah I just programmed it
to come down to my mouth and then poorly

1500
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:53,880
to come down to my mouth and then poorly
 

1501
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,510
to come down to my mouth and then poorly
brush my front teeth yeah yeah it was

1502
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:56,520
brush my front teeth yeah yeah it was
 

1503
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,630
brush my front teeth yeah yeah it was
just swung back and forth I mean trialum

1504
00:28:59,630 --> 00:28:59,640
just swung back and forth I mean trialum
 

1505
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,810
just swung back and forth I mean trialum
error what was the challenges of that

1506
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:02,820
error what was the challenges of that
 

1507
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,909
error what was the challenges of that
do you remember oh gosh or was that one

1508
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:04,919
do you remember oh gosh or was that one
 

1509
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:07,430
do you remember oh gosh or was that one
not much of a struggle challenge no it

1510
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:07,440
not much of a struggle challenge no it
 

1511
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,049
not much of a struggle challenge no it
was definitely a struggle

1512
00:29:09,049 --> 00:29:09,059
was definitely a struggle
 

1513
00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:10,549
was definitely a struggle
um because also how do you Loop it with

1514
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:10,559
um because also how do you Loop it with
 

1515
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:12,110
um because also how do you Loop it with
a nice gift

1516
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:12,120
a nice gift
 

1517
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,810
a nice gift
I mean it looks fine yeah it looks like

1518
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:14,820
I mean it looks fine yeah it looks like
 

1519
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,510
I mean it looks fine yeah it looks like
yeah that's not that's not that hard uh

1520
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:17,520
yeah that's not that's not that hard uh
 

1521
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,830
yeah that's not that's not that hard uh
no I mean it doesn't have to be perfect

1522
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:18,840
no I mean it doesn't have to be perfect
 

1523
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,870
no I mean it doesn't have to be perfect
it's a gif it's the internet things are

1524
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:20,880
it's a gif it's the internet things are
 

1525
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,970
it's a gif it's the internet things are
shitty all the time I think I mean I

1526
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:22,980
shitty all the time I think I mean I
 

1527
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:25,130
shitty all the time I think I mean I
think the biggest struggle of that was

1528
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:25,140
think the biggest struggle of that was
 

1529
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,169
think the biggest struggle of that was
that I had this intention for it to be

1530
00:29:27,169 --> 00:29:27,179
that I had this intention for it to be
 

1531
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:29,590
that I had this intention for it to be
this show and then

1532
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:29,600
this show and then
 

1533
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,649
this show and then
them not giving oh yeah yeah giving back

1534
00:29:33,649 --> 00:29:33,659
them not giving oh yeah yeah giving back
 

1535
00:29:33,659 --> 00:29:35,330
them not giving oh yeah yeah giving back
and I was like well if they don't want

1536
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:35,340
and I was like well if they don't want
 

1537
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,630
and I was like well if they don't want
it then maybe YouTube will have me they

1538
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:38,640
it then maybe YouTube will have me they
 

1539
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,669
it then maybe YouTube will have me they
don't notice my genius yet what was it

1540
00:29:40,669 --> 00:29:40,679
don't notice my genius yet what was it
 

1541
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:42,289
don't notice my genius yet what was it
what was so bad about the pilot do you

1542
00:29:42,289 --> 00:29:42,299
what was so bad about the pilot do you
 

1543
00:29:42,299 --> 00:29:43,490
what was so bad about the pilot do you
remember what's like the most

1544
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:43,500
remember what's like the most
 

1545
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:46,070
remember what's like the most
embarrassing oh cringy yeah I mean it's

1546
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:46,080
embarrassing oh cringy yeah I mean it's
 

1547
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,110
embarrassing oh cringy yeah I mean it's
thankfully not on the internet so nobody

1548
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:48,120
thankfully not on the internet so nobody
 

1549
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,590
thankfully not on the internet so nobody
can find it but it's very much me being

1550
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:51,600
can find it but it's very much me being
 

1551
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,570
can find it but it's very much me being
in what I called host mode which is

1552
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:53,580
in what I called host mode which is
 

1553
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,549
in what I called host mode which is
where I'm like okay so what we're gonna

1554
00:29:55,549 --> 00:29:55,559
where I'm like okay so what we're gonna
 

1555
00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:57,470
where I'm like okay so what we're gonna
learn today is that we're gonna look at

1556
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:57,480
learn today is that we're gonna look at
 

1557
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,970
learn today is that we're gonna look at
this this is something called a Servo

1558
00:29:58,970 --> 00:29:58,980
this this is something called a Servo
 

1559
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,710
this this is something called a Servo
motor and it's like the intonation and

1560
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:00,720
motor and it's like the intonation and
 

1561
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,149
motor and it's like the intonation and
everything is really different

1562
00:30:02,149 --> 00:30:02,159
everything is really different
 

1563
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:04,310
everything is really different
and I'm actually I mean I thinking back

1564
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:04,320
and I'm actually I mean I thinking back
 

1565
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,130
and I'm actually I mean I thinking back
of that I'm so happy that they didn't

1566
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:07,140
of that I'm so happy that they didn't
 

1567
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,750
of that I'm so happy that they didn't
get back to me

1568
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:08,760
get back to me
 

1569
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:13,010
get back to me
because it's such a different thing to

1570
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:13,020
because it's such a different thing to
 

1571
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,470
because it's such a different thing to
kind of start your career in your living

1572
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:15,480
kind of start your career in your living
 

1573
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,870
kind of start your career in your living
room running back and forth to the

it so like to me there's uh like feeding
is tricky

1730
00:33:21,289 --> 00:33:21,299

00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:24,169
is tricky
or even like getting a beer even pouring

or even like getting a beer even pouring
a beer is tough into a glass yeah it's

1734
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:27,120
a beer is tough into a glass yeah it's
 

1735
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,970
a beer is tough into a glass yeah it's
trickier than anyone who hasn't tried it

1736
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:28,980
trickier than anyone who hasn't tried it
 

1737
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:31,250
trickier than anyone who hasn't tried it
thanks and

1738
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:31,260
thanks and
 

1739
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:34,130
thanks and
even making it I think what I realized

1740
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:34,140
even making it I think what I realized
 

1741
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,450
even making it I think what I realized
is that like

1742
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:35,460
is that like
 

1743
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,730
is that like
making things really shitty or like

1744
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:37,740
making things really shitty or like
 

1745
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,950
making things really shitty or like
failing in a spectacular way is also its

1746
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:39,960
failing in a spectacular way is also its
 

1747
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,389
failing in a spectacular way is also its
own sort of skill because like the

1748
00:33:41,389 --> 00:33:41,399
own sort of skill because like the
 

1749
00:33:41,399 --> 00:33:42,710
own sort of skill because like the
shittiest robot is the one that doesn't

1750
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:42,720
shittiest robot is the one that doesn't
 

1751
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,490
shittiest robot is the one that doesn't
turn on right but like that isn't much

1752
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:46,500
turn on right but like that isn't much
 

1753
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,769
turn on right but like that isn't much
to watch so it was always like wanting

1754
00:33:48,769 --> 00:33:48,779
to watch so it was always like wanting
 

1755
00:33:48,779 --> 00:33:50,450
to watch so it was always like wanting
for it to fail in these kind of

1756
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:50,460
for it to fail in these kind of
 

1757
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,490
for it to fail in these kind of
spectacular ways

1758
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:52,500
spectacular ways
 

1759
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,130
spectacular ways
um no there's a lot of stuff to be said

1760
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:55,140
um no there's a lot of stuff to be said
 

1761
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:57,169
um no there's a lot of stuff to be said
about Engineering in it is there

1762
00:33:57,169 --> 00:33:57,179
about Engineering in it is there
 

1763
00:33:57,179 --> 00:33:58,909
about Engineering in it is there
something to be said on a philosophical

1764
00:33:58,909 --> 00:33:58,919
something to be said on a philosophical
 

1765
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:02,029
something to be said on a philosophical
level about the value of a flawed robot

1766
00:34:02,029 --> 00:34:02,039
level about the value of a flawed robot
 

1767
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:04,549
level about the value of a flawed robot
so like

1768
00:34:04,549 --> 00:34:04,559
so like
 

1769
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:06,710
so like
the kind of robots you want is to be

1770
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:06,720
the kind of robots you want is to be
 

1771
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,570
the kind of robots you want is to be
partially flawed like do you think the

1772
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:08,580
partially flawed like do you think the
 

1773
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,270
partially flawed like do you think the
kind of robots will have in the home

1774
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:10,280
kind of robots will have in the home
 

1775
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:13,669
kind of robots will have in the home
that are friends and

1776
00:34:13,669 --> 00:34:13,679
that are friends and
 

1777
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,790
that are friends and
um you know almost like pets wouldn't

1778
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:16,800
um you know almost like pets wouldn't
 

1779
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,030
um you know almost like pets wouldn't
they need to be kind of shitty because

1780
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:20,040
they need to be kind of shitty because
 

1781
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,490
they need to be kind of shitty because
we can love the somehow we humans loved

1782
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:22,500
we can love the somehow we humans loved
 

1783
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,349
we can love the somehow we humans loved
the shitty I mean it is kind of

1784
00:34:24,349 --> 00:34:24,359
the shitty I mean it is kind of
 

1785
00:34:24,359 --> 00:34:26,510
the shitty I mean it is kind of
endearing and because I think it it kind

1786
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:26,520
endearing and because I think it it kind
 

1787
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:29,230
endearing and because I think it it kind
of I'm gonna mess up this world word

1788
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:29,240
of I'm gonna mess up this world word
 

1789
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,490
of I'm gonna mess up this world word
anthropomorphize system

1790
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:31,500
anthropomorphize system
 

1791
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,230
anthropomorphize system
I think it's I mean I never feel as

1792
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:33,240
I think it's I mean I never feel as
 

1793
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,089
I think it's I mean I never feel as
deeply connected to my Roomba as when

1794
00:34:35,089 --> 00:34:35,099
deeply connected to my Roomba as when
 

1795
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:36,169
deeply connected to my Roomba as when
it's like

1796
00:34:36,169 --> 00:34:36,179
it's like
 

1797
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:40,129
it's like
I'm on a cliff like paper have you had

1798
00:34:40,129 --> 00:34:40,139
I'm on a cliff like paper have you had
 

1799
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:42,649
I'm on a cliff like paper have you had
roomba's taught me ledge no I really

1800
00:34:42,649 --> 00:34:42,659
roomba's taught me ledge no I really
 

1801
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:45,050
roomba's taught me ledge no I really
yeah I've done that a lot yeah when they

1802
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:45,060
yeah I've done that a lot yeah when they
 

1803
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:48,129
yeah I've done that a lot yeah when they
talk to you yeah

1804
00:34:48,129 --> 00:34:48,139
talk to you yeah
 

1805
00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:51,050
talk to you yeah
immediately anthropomorphize them yeah

1806
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:51,060
immediately anthropomorphize them yeah
 

1807
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,490
immediately anthropomorphize them yeah
and then you have if they have a name

1808
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:52,500
and then you have if they have a name
 

1809
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,470
and then you have if they have a name
which is why most roboticists don't give

1810
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:54,480
which is why most roboticists don't give
 

1811
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,770
which is why most roboticists don't give
names or gender to robots because you

1812
00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:56,780
names or gender to robots because you
 

1813
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:59,750
names or gender to robots because you
become connected to them I'm of the

1814
00:34:59,750 --> 00:34:59,760
become connected to them I'm of the
 

1815
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,829
become connected to them I'm of the
opposite mind

1816
00:35:00,829 --> 00:35:00,839
opposite mind
 

1817
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:03,589
opposite mind
you should have like an intimate

1818
00:35:03,589 --> 00:35:03,599
you should have like an intimate
 

1819
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:06,410
you should have like an intimate
relationship sounds weird but you should

1820
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:06,420
relationship sounds weird but you should
 

1821
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:08,270
relationship sounds weird but you should
have a close connection to robots I mean

1822
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:08,280
have a close connection to robots I mean
 

1823
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,790
have a close connection to robots I mean
there there's power in that there's a

1824
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:10,800
there there's power in that there's a
 

1825
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,089
there there's power in that there's a
social element of Robotics even an arm

1826
00:35:14,089 --> 00:35:14,099
social element of Robotics even an arm
 

1827
00:35:14,099 --> 00:35:16,010
social element of Robotics even an arm
I don't know there's something about us

1828
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:16,020
I don't know there's something about us
 

1829
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:19,370
I don't know there's something about us
humans that gain so much value

1830
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:19,380
humans that gain so much value
 

1831
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:22,970
humans that gain so much value
from our interaction with Dynamic

1832
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:22,980
from our interaction with Dynamic
 

1833
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,589
from our interaction with Dynamic
objects and we should like lean into

1834
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:24,599
objects and we should like lean into
 

1835
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:26,390
objects and we should like lean into
that as opposed to run away from it that

1836
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:26,400
that as opposed to run away from it that
 

1837
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,770
that as opposed to run away from it that
was always the confusing thing to me

1838
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:27,780
was always the confusing thing to me
 

1839
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:30,470
was always the confusing thing to me
about robotics is that most roboticists

1840
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:30,480
about robotics is that most roboticists
 

1841
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,510
about robotics is that most roboticists
run away from that yeah

1842
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:32,520
run away from that yeah
 

1843
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:35,270
run away from that yeah
weird because it's obviously going to be

1844
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:35,280
weird because it's obviously going to be
 

1845
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,950
weird because it's obviously going to be
robots are obviously going to be

1846
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:36,960
robots are obviously going to be
 

1847
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,790
robots are obviously going to be
everywhere

1848
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:37,800
everywhere
 

1849
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,130
everywhere
yeah obviously but it's also humans are

1850
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:40,140
yeah obviously but it's also humans are
 

1851
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:42,170
yeah obviously but it's also humans are
sensitive and Squishy and there's so

1852
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:42,180
sensitive and Squishy and there's so
 

1853
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:44,870
sensitive and Squishy and there's so
much liability oh yeah

1854
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:44,880
much liability oh yeah
 

1855
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,630
much liability oh yeah
yeah but the humans are sensitive and

1856
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:47,640
yeah but the humans are sensitive and
 

1857
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,890
yeah but the humans are sensitive and
Squishy

1858
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:48,900
Squishy
 

1859
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,390
Squishy
when they interact with each other and

1860
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:50,400
when they interact with each other and
 

1861
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,030
when they interact with each other and
they hurt each other all the time

1862
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:52,040
they hurt each other all the time
 

1863
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,710
they hurt each other all the time
like sometimes they get together and

1864
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:54,720
like sometimes they get together and
 

1865
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,089
like sometimes they get together and
they're like oh you're the best you know

1866
00:35:56,089 --> 00:35:56,099
they're like oh you're the best you know
 

1867
00:35:56,099 --> 00:35:57,650
they're like oh you're the best you know
you're the best and then they leave each

1868
00:35:57,650 --> 00:35:57,660
you're the best and then they leave each
 

1869
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,270
you're the best and then they leave each
other and then they break each other's

1870
00:35:59,270 --> 00:35:59,280
other and then they break each other's
 

1871
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,210
other and then they break each other's
heart sorry about your breakup life he's

1872
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:02,220
heart sorry about your breakup life he's
 

1873
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,710
heart sorry about your breakup life he's
trying to get over this

1874
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:03,720
trying to get over this
 

1875
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,829
trying to get over this
I'm actually drunk for this interview I

1876
00:36:06,829 --> 00:36:06,839
I'm actually drunk for this interview I
 

1877
00:36:06,839 --> 00:36:10,130
I'm actually drunk for this interview I
haven't been able to sleep

1878
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:10,140

 

1879
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,450

but

1880
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:11,460
but
 

1881
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,130
but
from a safety protocol perspective

1882
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:13,140
from a safety protocol perspective
 

1883
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:15,470
from a safety protocol perspective
people think about like physical damage

1884
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:15,480
people think about like physical damage
 

1885
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,210
people think about like physical damage
not emotional damage I know this sounds

1886

putting a lot of care into the projects
 

1997
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,410

2007
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,089
mean it is it's like I feel like any

it funniest
 

2195
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:13,490
it funniest
is no I think it's more like the proud

2196
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:13,500
is no I think it's more like the proud
 

2197
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,470
is no I think it's more like the proud
parent machine it's not violent it

2198
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:15,480
parent machine it's not violent it
 

2199
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,390
parent machine it's not violent it
doesn't there's no nothing it's just

2200
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:17,400
doesn't there's no nothing it's just
 

2201
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:21,290
doesn't there's no nothing it's just
emotional and it's kind of

2202
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:21,300

 

2203
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,630

a commentary on this fraught

2204
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:23,640
a commentary on this fraught
 

2205
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,250
a commentary on this fraught
relationship that we sometimes have with

2206
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:25,260
relationship that we sometimes have with
 

2207
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:26,770
relationship that we sometimes have with
our parents and their pride of us

2208
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:26,780
our parents and their pride of us
 

2209
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:29,030
our parents and their pride of us
sometimes every time

2210
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:29,040
sometimes every time
 

2211
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:32,270
sometimes every time
sometimes my dad visited like last week

2212
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:32,280
sometimes my dad visited like last week
 

2213
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,069
sometimes my dad visited like last week
and he was like I just want to say I'm

2214
00:42:34,069 --> 00:42:34,079
and he was like I just want to say I'm
 

2215
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:35,810
and he was like I just want to say I'm
so proud of you and for the built life

2216
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:35,820
so proud of you and for the built life
 

2217
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:37,490
so proud of you and for the built life
you've built for yourself and that was

2218
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:37,500
you've built for yourself and that was
 

2219
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:38,569
you've built for yourself and that was
really sweet

2220
00:42:38,569 --> 00:42:38,579
really sweet
 

2221
00:42:38,579 --> 00:42:40,550
really sweet
yeah I'll put that on the back of my

2222
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:40,560
yeah I'll put that on the back of my
 

2223
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,829
yeah I'll put that on the back of my
autobiography too yeah it's not your

2224
00:42:42,829 --> 00:42:42,839
autobiography too yeah it's not your
 

2225
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:45,470
autobiography too yeah it's not your
fault Simone it's not your fault that

2226
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:45,480
fault Simone it's not your fault that
 

2227
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,329
fault Simone it's not your fault that
stuff is my fault

2228
00:42:47,329 --> 00:42:47,339
stuff is my fault
 

2229
00:42:47,339 --> 00:42:50,089
stuff is my fault
what was the longest one to complete for

2230
00:42:50,089 --> 00:42:50,099
what was the longest one to complete for
 

2231
00:42:50,099 --> 00:42:52,849
what was the longest one to complete for
the Shady robots that you remember

2232
00:42:52,849 --> 00:42:52,859
the Shady robots that you remember
 

2233
00:42:52,859 --> 00:42:54,650
the Shady robots that you remember
because he spent on a few of them you

2234
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:54,660
because he spent on a few of them you
 

2235
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:56,830
because he spent on a few of them you
spent quite a long time

2236
00:42:56,830 --> 00:42:56,840
spent quite a long time
 

2237
00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:00,050
spent quite a long time

2239
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:02,210

which is also inspiring when you take so

2240
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:02,220
which is also inspiring when you take so
 

2241
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:05,329
which is also inspiring when you take so
long in a project yeah I think um

2242
00:43:05,329 --> 00:43:05,339
long in a project yeah I think um
 

2243
00:43:05,339 --> 00:43:07,309
long in a project yeah I think um
can even the more like fun Whimsical

2244
00:43:07,309 --> 00:43:07,319
can even the more like fun Whimsical
 

2245
00:43:07,319 --> 00:43:09,470
can even the more like fun Whimsical
Department rather than shitty robots I

2246
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:09,480
Department rather than shitty robots I
 

2247
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,750
Department rather than shitty robots I
built recently

2248
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:11,760
built recently
 

2249
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:14,089
built recently
um this music box so like a small music

2250
00:43:14,089 --> 00:43:14,099
um this music box so like a small music
 

2251
00:43:14,099 --> 00:43:16,250
um this music box so like a small music
box that kind of has a barrel with

2252
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:16,260
box that kind of has a barrel with
 

2253
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,750
box that kind of has a barrel with
little spikes and it plays the song but

2254
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:17,760
little spikes and it plays the song but
 

2255
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,150
little spikes and it plays the song but
I did a large version of that that pops

2256
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:20,160
I did a large version of that that pops
 

2257
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,950
I did a large version of that that pops
a sheet of bubble wrap and then like

2258
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:21,960
a sheet of bubble wrap and then like
 

2259
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:24,470
a sheet of bubble wrap and then like
plays tones into a pan flute so yeah you

2260
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:24,480
plays tones into a pan flute so yeah you
 

2261
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,609
plays tones into a pan flute so yeah you
can actually program it to play

2262
00:43:25,609 --> 00:43:25,619
can actually program it to play
 

2263
00:43:25,619 --> 00:43:27,770
can actually program it to play
different songs

2264
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:27,780
different songs
 

2265
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:29,630
different songs
that one kicked my butt in so many

2266
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:29,640
that one kicked my butt in so many
 

2267
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,030
that one kicked my butt in so many
creative ways that it was such a pain I

2268
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:32,040
creative ways that it was such a pain I
 

2269
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:35,270
creative ways that it was such a pain I
think that is probably the like

2270
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:35,280
think that is probably the like
 

2271
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,630
think that is probably the like
weird funny project that's taken me the

2272
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:38,640
weird funny project that's taken me the
 

2273
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,250
weird funny project that's taken me the
longest and like the biggest engineering

2274
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:40,260
longest and like the biggest engineering
 

2275
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:42,770
longest and like the biggest engineering
effort where's the all sound coming from

2276
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:42,780
effort where's the all sound coming from
 

2277
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:45,950
effort where's the all sound coming from
so if you it all came from me realizing

2278
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:45,960
so if you it all came from me realizing
 

2279
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,930
so if you it all came from me realizing
that if you pop bubble wrap and you pop

2280
00:43:47,930 --> 00:43:47,940
that if you pop bubble wrap and you pop
 

2281
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:50,390
that if you pop bubble wrap and you pop
it right in front of the opening of a

2282
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:50,400
it right in front of the opening of a
 

2283
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,069
it right in front of the opening of a
pamphlet or like one of the pipes you

2284
00:43:52,069 --> 00:43:52,079
pamphlet or like one of the pipes you
 

2285
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:54,290
pamphlet or like one of the pipes you
can have it play different tones

2286
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:54,300
can have it play different tones
 

2287
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:57,349
can have it play different tones
so that's what it does so I built this

2288
00:43:57,349 --> 00:43:57,359
so that's what it does so I built this
 

2289
00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:01,790
so that's what it does so I built this
music instrument off of that okay if

2290
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:01,800
music instrument off of that okay if
 

2291
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,170
music instrument off of that okay if
it's okay can you describe some

2292
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:03,180
it's okay can you describe some
 

2293
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:04,849
it's okay can you describe some
something like how it works some of the

2294
00:44:04,849 --> 00:44:04,859
something like how it works some of the
 

2295
00:44:04,859 --> 00:44:07,309
something like how it works some of the
the technical details here yeah so

2296
00:44:07,309 --> 00:44:07,319
the technical details here yeah so
 

2297
00:44:07,319 --> 00:44:11,510
the technical details here yeah so
basically I mean one of the

2298
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:11,520

 

2299
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,130

things that I worked with

2300
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:13,140
things that I worked with
 

2301
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:15,710
things that I worked with
um as of a year and a half back I hired

2302
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:15,720
um as of a year and a half back I hired
 

2303
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,270
um as of a year and a half back I hired
an engineer stew so we were

2304
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:17,280
an engineer stew so we were
 

2305
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,550
an engineer stew so we were
collaborating on it

2306
00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:19,560
collaborating on it
 

2307
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,470
collaborating on it
um but a big issue that we had was

2308
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:21,480
um but a big issue that we had was
 

2309
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:23,930
um but a big issue that we had was
feeding in the bubble wrap

2310
00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:23,940
feeding in the bubble wrap
 

2311
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:26,089
feeding in the bubble wrap
sheet and like making sure that it feeds

2312
00:44:26,089 --> 00:44:26,099
sheet and like making sure that it feeds
 

2313
00:44:26,099 --> 00:44:27,589
sheet and like making sure that it feeds
them straight and doesn't get skewed

2314
00:44:27,589 --> 00:44:27,599
them straight and doesn't get skewed
 

2315
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:29,450
them straight and doesn't get skewed
because you need to make like the

2316
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:29,460
because you need to make like the
 

2317
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:31,910
because you need to make like the
popping feet which is where you program

2318
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:31,920
popping feet which is where you program
 

2319
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,130
popping feet which is where you program
this Barrel to pop different bubbles

2320
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:34,140
this Barrel to pop different bubbles
 

2321
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:38,270
this Barrel to pop different bubbles
need to be so perfectly aligned on the

2322
00:44:38,270 --> 00:44:38,280
need to be so perfectly aligned on the
 

2323
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,130
need to be so perfectly aligned on the
bubble of the bubble wrap for it to pop

2324
00:44:40,130 --> 00:44:40,140
bubble of the bubble wrap for it to pop
 

2325
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:41,809
bubble of the bubble wrap for it to pop
in the right location so there's a

2326
00:44:41,809 --> 00:44:41,819
in the right location so there's a
 

2327
00:44:41,819 --> 00:44:43,609
in the right location so there's a
feeder for the bubble wrap that's a

2328
00:44:43,609 --> 00:44:43,619
feeder for the bubble wrap that's a
 

2329
00:44:43,619 --> 00:44:44,870
feeder for the bubble wrap that's a
challenge and then you have to have a

2330
00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:44,880
challenge and then you have to have a
 

2331
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,210
challenge and then you have to have a
barrel with the little baby feet on it

2332
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:47,220
barrel with the little baby feet on it
 

2333
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:49,490
barrel with the little baby feet on it
yeah that pops the ball around why is it

2334
00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:49,500
yeah that pops the ball around why is it
 

2335
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:53,870
yeah that pops the ball around why is it
so exciting that Barrel was a pain as

2336
00:44:53,870 --> 00:44:53,880
so exciting that Barrel was a pain as
 

2337
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:56,270
so exciting that Barrel was a pain as
well I had to get a like this rotary

2338
00:44:56,270 --> 00:44:56,280
well I had to get a like this rotary
 

2339
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:59,150
well I had to get a like this rotary
setup for my CNC and yeah it was it was

2340
00:44:59,150 --> 00:44:59,160
setup for my CNC and yeah it was it was
 

2341
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:00,530
setup for my CNC and yeah it was it was
a lot of work

2342
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:00,540
a lot of work
 

2343
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:02,630
a lot of work
um but that was really fun and it's just

2344
00:45:02,630 --> 00:45:02,640
um but that was really fun and it's just
 

2345
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:03,910
um but that was really fun and it's just
like

2346
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:03,920
like
 

2347
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:06,410
like
this is probably my

2348
00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:06,420
this is probably my
 

2349
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:07,670
this is probably my

interesting did you have a lot of

2356
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:16,800
interesting did you have a lot of
 

2357
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,569
interesting did you have a lot of
Joy from popping the

2358
00:45:19,569 --> 00:45:19,579
Joy from popping the
 

2359
00:45:19,579 --> 00:45:22,490
Joy from popping the
yeah the bubbles a lot of self-soothing

2360
00:45:22,490 --> 00:45:22,500
yeah the bubbles a lot of self-soothing
 

2361
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:24,890
yeah the bubbles a lot of self-soothing
and like I got to spend I think I spent

2362
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:24,900
and like I got to spend I think I spent
 

2363
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:27,730
and like I got to spend I think I spent
a week trying to figure out the best

2364
00:45:27,730 --> 00:45:27,740
a week trying to figure out the best
 

2365
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:30,230
a week trying to figure out the best
material to pop bubble wrap with because

2366
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:30,240
material to pop bubble wrap with because
 

2367
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,390
material to pop bubble wrap with because
if you have two if you kind of put them

2368
00:45:32,390 --> 00:45:32,400
if you have two if you kind of put them
 

2369
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,030
if you have two if you kind of put them
to to through uh or through if you put a

2370
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:35,040
to to through uh or through if you put a
 

2371
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,670
to to through uh or through if you put a
sheet of bubble wrap through two rigid

2372
00:45:37,670 --> 00:45:37,680
sheet of bubble wrap through two rigid
 

2373
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,370
sheet of bubble wrap through two rigid
tubes the air kind of just escapes from

2374
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:40,380
tubes the air kind of just escapes from
 

2375
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:42,290
tubes the air kind of just escapes from
one side of the bubble into the other so

2376
00:45:42,290 --> 00:45:42,300
one side of the bubble into the other so
 

2377
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:43,849
one side of the bubble into the other so
what I realized was that if you have a

2378
00:45:43,849 --> 00:45:43,859
what I realized was that if you have a
 

2379
00:45:43,859 --> 00:45:45,829
what I realized was that if you have a
squishy material like kind of a yoga mat

2380
00:45:45,829 --> 00:45:45,839
squishy material like kind of a yoga mat
 

2381
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:48,770
squishy material like kind of a yoga mat
material in between it it actually it

2382
00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:48,780
material in between it it actually it
 

2383
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:51,370
material in between it it actually it
prevents that and Pops it a lot more

2384
00:45:51,370 --> 00:45:51,380
prevents that and Pops it a lot more
 

2385
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:54,589
prevents that and Pops it a lot more
reliably but like increasing the pop

2386
00:45:54,589 --> 00:45:54,599
reliably but like increasing the pop
 

2387
00:45:54,599 --> 00:45:57,589
reliably but like increasing the pop
reliability was a huge effort as well

2388
00:45:57,589 --> 00:45:57,599
reliability was a huge effort as well
 

2389
00:45:57,599 --> 00:45:59,210
reliability was a huge effort as well
you have to pop a squishy thing with

2390
00:45:59,210 --> 00:45:59,220
you have to pop a squishy thing with
 

2391
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:00,589
you have to pop a squishy thing with
another squishy because you don't need a

2392
00:46:00,589 --> 00:46:00,599
another squishy because you don't need a
 

2393
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:02,930
another squishy because you don't need a
lot of force yeah like you just need it

2394
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:02,940
lot of force yeah like you just need it
 

2395
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:05,390
lot of force yeah like you just need it
to not the air to not be able to escape

2396
00:46:05,390 --> 00:46:05,400
to not the air to not be able to escape
 

2397
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:08,630
to not the air to not be able to escape
anywhere wow but then also we had there

2398
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:08,640
anywhere wow but then also we had there
 

2399
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,970
anywhere wow but then also we had there
was different qualities of bubble wrap

2400
00:46:10,970 --> 00:46:10,980
was different qualities of bubble wrap
 

2401
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:12,890
was different qualities of bubble wrap
where there was a lot of transference

2402
00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:12,900
where there was a lot of transference
 

2403
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:14,630
where there was a lot of transference
between different bubbles so instead of

2404
00:46:14,630 --> 00:46:14,640
between different bubbles so instead of
 

2405
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,250
between different bubbles so instead of
the bubble popping it would just seep

2406
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:16,260
the bubble popping it would just seep
 

2407
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:18,410
the bubble popping it would just seep
the air and to a neighboring bubble and

2408
00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:18,420
the air and to a neighboring bubble and
 

2409
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:20,450
the air and to a neighboring bubble and
that like membrane would kind of so you

2410
00:46:20,450 --> 00:46:20,460
that like membrane would kind of so you
 

2411
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:22,670
that like membrane would kind of so you
know I I just like getting to spend

2412
00:46:22,670 --> 00:46:22,680
know I I just like getting to spend
 

2413
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:25,550
know I I just like getting to spend
weeks on weeks of just studying bubble

2414
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:25,560
weeks on weeks of just studying bubble
 

2415
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:27,109
weeks on weeks of just studying bubble
wrap did you ever think about like

2416
00:46:27,109 --> 00:46:27,119
wrap did you ever think about like
 

2417
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:29,089
wrap did you ever think about like
publishing academic work on Bubble Wrap

2418
00:46:29,089 --> 00:46:29,099
publishing academic work on Bubble Wrap
 

2419
00:46:29,099 --> 00:46:30,230
publishing academic work on Bubble Wrap
no

2420
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:30,240
no
 

2421
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,089
no
wouldn't that be epic because nobody's

2422
00:46:32,089 --> 00:46:32,099
wouldn't that be epic because nobody's
 

2423
00:46:32,099 --> 00:46:34,450
wouldn't that be epic because nobody's
done this I bet you nobody's done

2424
00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:34,460
done this I bet you nobody's done
 

2425
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:36,770
done this I bet you nobody's done
squishing it squishing material on

2426
00:46:36,770 --> 00:46:36,780
squishing it squishing material on
 

2427
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:39,349
squishing it squishing material on
Squishy versus squishy

2428
00:46:39,349 --> 00:46:39,359
Squishy versus squishy
 

2429
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:42,290
Squishy versus squishy
for popping I bet somebody has but you

2430
00:46:42,290 --> 00:46:42,300
for popping I bet somebody has but you
 

2431
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,089
for popping I bet somebody has but you
know I I always I thought I was gonna go

2432
00:46:44,089 --> 00:46:44,099
know I I always I thought I was gonna go
 

2433
00:46:44,099 --> 00:46:46,670
know I I always I thought I was gonna go
into Academia like I was such an

2434
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:46,680
into Academia like I was such an
 

2435
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:50,510
into Academia like I was such an
ambitious student I loved school I

2436
00:46:50,510 --> 00:46:50,520
ambitious student I loved school I
 

2437
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,849
ambitious student I loved school I
actually applied to MIT but then I

2438
00:46:52,849 --> 00:46:52,859
actually applied to MIT but then I
 

2439
00:46:52,859 --> 00:46:54,290
actually applied to MIT but then I
pulled out because I was like no I don't

2440
00:46:54,290 --> 00:46:54,300
pulled out because I was like no I don't
 

2441
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:55,910
pulled out because I was like no I don't
want to do it

2442
00:46:55,910 --> 00:46:55,920
want to do it
 

2443
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,770
want to do it
um but now I realize it's really good

2444
00:46:57,770 --> 00:46:57,780
um but now I realize it's really good
 

2445
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:59,329
um but now I realize it's really good
that I didn't because I'm too much of a

2446
00:46:59,329 --> 00:46:59,339
that I didn't because I'm too much of a
 

2447
00:46:59,339 --> 00:47:01,849
that I didn't because I'm too much of a
spouse too much of the spaz now I'm

2448
00:47:01,849 --> 00:47:01,859
spouse too much of the spaz now I'm
 

2449
00:47:01,859 --> 00:47:04,069
spouse too much of the spaz now I'm
distracted I'm thinking there must be

2450
00:47:04,069 --> 00:47:04,079
distracted I'm thinking there must be
 

2451
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:07,250
distracted I'm thinking there must be
papers about when you have two bubbles

2452
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:07,260
papers about when you have two bubbles
 

2453
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:09,470
papers about when you have two bubbles
yeah you need to know the physics of two

2454
00:47:09,470 --> 00:47:09,480
yeah you need to know the physics of two
 

2455
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:11,150
yeah you need to know the physics of two
bubbles when you have two bubbles

2456
00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:11,160
bubbles when you have two bubbles
 

2457
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:13,010
bubbles when you have two bubbles
colliding

2458
00:47:13,010 --> 00:47:13,020
colliding
 

2459
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:15,470
colliding
one will pop first

2460
00:47:15,470 --> 00:47:15,480
one will pop first
 

2461
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:18,109
one will pop first
and there has to be good models of that

2462
00:47:18,109 --> 00:47:18,119
and there has to be good models of that
 

2463
00:47:18,119 --> 00:47:19,910
and there has to be good models of that
but that's very that has to do with

2464
00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:19,920
but that's very that has to do with
 

2465
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,210
but that's very that has to do with
chemistry and whatever the uh the

2466
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:23,220
chemistry and whatever the uh the
 

2467
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:24,589
chemistry and whatever the uh the
material the ball was made from but then

2468
00:47:24,589 --> 00:47:24,599
material the ball was made from but then
 

2469
00:47:24,599 --> 00:47:26,329
material the ball was made from but then
no there's materials in here this guy

2470
00:47:26,329 --> 00:47:26,339
no there's materials in here this guy
 

2471
00:47:26,339 --> 00:47:28,130
no there's materials in here this guy
somebody must understand bubble wrap

2472
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:28,140
somebody must understand bubble wrap
 

2473
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:29,329
somebody must understand bubble wrap
deeply

2474
00:47:29,329 --> 00:47:29,339
deeply
 

2475
00:47:29,339 --> 00:47:31,069
deeply
like deeply

2476
00:47:31,069 --> 00:47:31,079
like deeply
 

2477
00:47:31,079 --> 00:47:32,750
like deeply
so I'm just going to take a quick

00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,170
the restroom okay
so I'm going to insert like a two hour

2488
00:47:45,170 --> 00:47:45,180
so I'm going to insert like a two hour
 

2489
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:47,510
so I'm going to insert like a two hour
uh instructional here with like a

an interaction
so you did mention

2508
00:48:08,089 --> 00:48:08,099
so you did mention
 

2509
00:48:08,099 --> 00:48:10,910
so you did mention
um MIT uh you went to college for

2510
00:48:10,910 --> 00:48:10,920
um MIT uh you went to college for
 

2511
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:13,609
um MIT uh you went to college for
physics for one year and you dropped out

2512
00:48:13,609 --> 00:48:13,619
physics for one year and you dropped out
 

2513
00:48:13,619 --> 00:48:15,349
physics for one year and you dropped out
what do you learn from that

2514
00:48:15,349 --> 00:48:15,359
what do you learn from that
 

2515
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,970
what do you learn from that
who do you think should and shouldn't go

2516
00:48:16,970 --> 00:48:16,980
who do you think should and shouldn't go
 

2517
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:19,069
who do you think should and shouldn't go
to college hmm

2518
00:48:19,069 --> 00:48:19,079
to college hmm
 

2519
00:48:19,079 --> 00:48:20,089
to college hmm
I think first of all you shouldn't

2520
00:48:20,089 --> 00:48:20,099
I think first of all you shouldn't
 

2521
00:48:20,099 --> 00:48:21,530
I think first of all you shouldn't
listen to me

2522
00:48:21,530 --> 00:48:21,540
listen to me
 

2523
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:22,250
listen to me
um

2524
00:48:22,250 --> 00:48:22,260
um
 

2525
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:23,569
um
that should be the name of your

2526
00:48:23,569 --> 00:48:23,579
that should be the name of your
 

2527
00:48:23,579 --> 00:48:26,870
that should be the name of your
autobiography

2528
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:26,880

 

2529
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,250

I

2530
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:28,260
I
 

2531
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:30,470
I
you know I realized that I was there for

2532
00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:30,480
you know I realized that I was there for
 

2533
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:34,809
you know I realized that I was there for
the wrong reasons I had this deep I got

2534
00:48:34,809 --> 00:48:34,819
the wrong reasons I had this deep I got
 

2535
00:48:34,819 --> 00:48:38,030
the wrong reasons I had this deep I got
completely like starting to get grades

2536
00:48:38,030 --> 00:48:38,040
completely like starting to get grades
 

2537
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,130
completely like starting to get grades
in school which in Sweden at that time

2538
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:40,140
in school which in Sweden at that time
 

2539
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:41,690
in school which in Sweden at that time
we started getting in at eighth grade so

2540
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:41,700
we started getting in at eighth grade so
 

2541
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:44,329
we started getting in at eighth grade so
when I was 14 it just kind of hijacked

2542
00:48:44,329 --> 00:48:44,339
when I was 14 it just kind of hijacked
 

2543
00:48:44,339 --> 00:48:46,069
when I was 14 it just kind of hijacked
my brain because I realized that I could

2544
00:48:46,069 --> 00:48:46,079
my brain because I realized that I could
 

2545
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:50,270
my brain because I realized that I could
put a number on how smart I was and I

2546
00:48:50,270 --> 00:48:50,280
put a number on how smart I was and I
 

2547
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:54,290
put a number on how smart I was and I
got obsessed with it and I

2548
00:48:54,290 --> 00:48:54,300
got obsessed with it and I
 

2549
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:57,109
got obsessed with it and I
wanted to study mechanical engineering

2550
00:48:57,109 --> 00:48:57,119
wanted to study mechanical engineering
 

2551
00:48:57,119 --> 00:48:59,750
wanted to study mechanical engineering
because I was like I like machines

2552
00:48:59,750 --> 00:48:59,760
because I was like I like machines
 

2553
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:02,569
because I was like I like machines
but then physics was kind of the hardest

2554
00:49:02,569 --> 00:49:02,579
but then physics was kind of the hardest
 

2555
00:49:02,579 --> 00:49:04,069
but then physics was kind of the hardest
thing you could do when I had this like

2556
00:49:04,069 --> 00:49:04,079
thing you could do when I had this like
 

2557
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:06,829
thing you could do when I had this like
deep need to prove to myself that I was

2558
00:49:06,829 --> 00:49:06,839
deep need to prove to myself that I was
 

2559
00:49:06,839 --> 00:49:09,290
deep need to prove to myself that I was
smart so I started studying physics

2560
00:49:09,290 --> 00:49:09,300
smart so I started studying physics
 

2561
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:11,990
smart so I started studying physics
realized I wasn't that smart

2562
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:12,000
realized I wasn't that smart
 

2563
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,270
realized I wasn't that smart
I realized or I mean just mostly that I

2564
00:49:14,270 --> 00:49:14,280
I realized or I mean just mostly that I
 

2565
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:16,550
I realized or I mean just mostly that I
like I love math but I don't love math

2566
00:49:16,550 --> 00:49:16,560
like I love math but I don't love math
 

2567
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:17,990
like I love math but I don't love math
10

2568
00:49:17,990 --> 00:49:18,000
10
 

2569
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:23,390
10
hours a day yeah and also I think I am a

2570
00:49:23,390 --> 00:49:23,400
hours a day yeah and also I think I am a
 

2571
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:26,450
hours a day yeah and also I think I am a
generalist through and through like I'm

2572
00:49:26,450 --> 00:49:26,460
generalist through and through like I'm
 

2573
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:29,150
generalist through and through like I'm
decent at a fair amount of things but

2574
00:49:29,150 --> 00:49:29,160
decent at a fair amount of things but
 

2575
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:31,730
decent at a fair amount of things but
definitely not a specialist and anyways

2576
00:49:31,730 --> 00:49:31,740
definitely not a specialist and anyways
 

2577
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:34,370
definitely not a specialist and anyways
and this it was such a specialist type

2578
00:49:34,370 --> 00:49:34,380
and this it was such a specialist type
 

2579
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:36,710
and this it was such a specialist type
of area

2580
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:36,720
of area
 

2581
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,450
of area
um that I felt like the other parts of

2582
00:49:38,450 --> 00:49:38,460
um that I felt like the other parts of
 

2583
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:40,250
um that I felt like the other parts of
my brain kind of just dwindled and died

2584
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:40,260
my brain kind of just dwindled and died
 

2585
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:43,069
my brain kind of just dwindled and died
so I think I think most of all if people

2586
00:49:43,069 --> 00:49:43,079
so I think I think most of all if people
 

2587
00:49:43,079 --> 00:49:45,589
so I think I think most of all if people
are thinking about going to college and

2588
00:49:45,589 --> 00:49:45,599
are thinking about going to college and
 

2589
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:46,910
are thinking about going to college and
especially if you're here in the States

2590
00:49:46,910 --> 00:49:46,920
especially if you're here in the States
 

2591
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:50,569
especially if you're here in the States
and it's so [\h__\h] expensive

2592
00:49:50,569 --> 00:49:50,579
and it's so [\h__\h] expensive
 

2593
00:49:50,579 --> 00:49:52,609
and it's so [\h__\h] expensive
really

2594
00:49:52,609 --> 00:49:52,619
really
 

2595
00:49:52,619 --> 00:49:54,230
really
okay there's two there's two things I

2596
00:49:54,230 --> 00:49:54,240
okay there's two there's two things I
 

2597
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:57,290
okay there's two there's two things I
want to do one is like actually go to a

2598
00:49:57,290 --> 00:49:57,300
want to do one is like actually go to a
 

2599
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:59,109
want to do one is like actually go to a
workplace where people are doing the job

2600
00:49:59,109 --> 00:49:59,119
workplace where people are doing the job
 

2601
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:01,430
workplace where people are doing the job
that you think you want to do if you

2602
00:50:01,430 --> 00:50:01,440
that you think you want to do if you
 

2603
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:04,370
that you think you want to do if you
want to become a doctor like be at a

2604
00:50:04,370 --> 00:50:04,380
want to become a doctor like be at a
 

2605
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:06,349
want to become a doctor like be at a
hospital and like try to see how doctors

2606
00:50:06,349 --> 00:50:06,359
hospital and like try to see how doctors
 

2607
00:50:06,359 --> 00:50:08,270
hospital and like try to see how doctors
work and if you actually like it because

2608
00:50:08,270 --> 00:50:08,280
work and if you actually like it because
 

2609
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:10,010
work and if you actually like it because
I feel like people have a lot of ideas

2610
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:10,020
I feel like people have a lot of ideas
 

2611
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:11,569
I feel like people have a lot of ideas
of what it's going to be like and it

2612
00:50:11,569 --> 00:50:11,579
of what it's going to be like and it
 

2613
00:50:11,579 --> 00:50:14,210
of what it's going to be like and it
just doesn't match with reality and then

2614
00:50:14,210 --> 00:50:14,220
just doesn't match with reality and then
 

2615
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:15,589
just doesn't match with reality and then
I think when people figure out what they

2616
00:50:15,589 --> 00:50:15,599
I think when people figure out what they
 

2617
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:17,569
I think when people figure out what they
want to do there's kind of

2618
00:50:17,569 --> 00:50:17,579
want to do there's kind of
 

2619
00:50:17,579 --> 00:50:19,609
want to do there's kind of
that's two separate questions or there's

2620
00:50:19,609 --> 00:50:19,619
that's two separate questions or there's
 

2621
00:50:19,619 --> 00:50:20,930
that's two separate questions or there's
two questions that you can split out of

2622
00:50:20,930 --> 00:50:20,940
two questions that you can split out of
 

2623
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:22,190
two questions that you can split out of
that one is like what do you actually

2624
00:50:22,190 --> 00:50:22,200
that one is like what do you actually
 

2625
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:24,710
that one is like what do you actually
want to do that for me

2626
00:50:24,710 --> 00:50:24,720
want to do that for me
 

2627
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,650
want to do that for me
for the last 10 years is building stuff

2628
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:27,660
for the last 10 years is building stuff
 

2629
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:29,870
for the last 10 years is building stuff
but then there's a second part to that

2630
00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:29,880
but then there's a second part to that
 

2631
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:31,609
but then there's a second part to that
question which is what context do you

2632
00:50:31,609 --> 00:50:31,619
question which is what context do you
 

2633
00:50:31,619 --> 00:50:33,109
question which is what context do you
want to do that do you want to build

2634
00:50:33,109 --> 00:50:33,119
want to do that do you want to build
 

2635
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:35,390
want to do that do you want to build
stuff at a startup or at a big

2636
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:35,400
stuff at a startup or at a big
 

2637
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,370
stuff at a startup or at a big
Corporation Do you want to build stuff

2638
00:50:37,370 --> 00:50:37,380
Corporation Do you want to build stuff
 

2639
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:40,370
Corporation Do you want to build stuff
for an art gallery or for the movies or

2640
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:40,380
for an art gallery or for the movies or
 

2641
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:43,430
for an art gallery or for the movies or
for YouTube and

2642
00:50:43,430 --> 00:50:43,440
for YouTube and
 

2643
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,770
for YouTube and
I think that's often like people only

2644
00:50:45,770 --> 00:50:45,780
I think that's often like people only
 

2645
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:47,450
I think that's often like people only
learn how to answer the first question

2646
00:50:47,450 --> 00:50:47,460
learn how to answer the first question
 

2647
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:49,490
learn how to answer the first question
but then it's like the context means as

2648
00:50:49,490 --> 00:50:49,500
but then it's like the context means as
 

2649
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:51,829
but then it's like the context means as
much because I was building stuff at

2650
00:50:51,829 --> 00:50:51,839
much because I was building stuff at
 

2651
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:53,870
much because I was building stuff at
punch through design and I wasn't

2652
00:50:53,870 --> 00:50:53,880
punch through design and I wasn't
 

2653
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:56,569
punch through design and I wasn't
getting that like deep fulfillment like

2654
00:50:56,569 --> 00:50:56,579
getting that like deep fulfillment like
 

2655
00:50:56,579 --> 00:50:58,190
getting that like deep fulfillment like
I felt like

2656
00:50:58,190 --> 00:50:58,200
I felt like
 

2657
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:01,069
I felt like
I wasn't fully using myself and like

2658
00:51:01,069 --> 00:51:01,079
I wasn't fully using myself and like
 

2659
00:51:01,079 --> 00:51:02,930
I wasn't fully using myself and like
hitting all of my gears because I just

2660
00:51:02,930 --> 00:51:02,940
hitting all of my gears because I just
 

2661
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:04,670
hitting all of my gears because I just
wasn't that motivated about building

2662
00:51:04,670 --> 00:51:04,680
wasn't that motivated about building
 

2663
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:07,069
wasn't that motivated about building
stuff for other people and I changed the

2664
00:51:07,069 --> 00:51:07,079
stuff for other people and I changed the
 

2665
00:51:07,079 --> 00:51:09,410
stuff for other people and I changed the
context and everything changed

2666
00:51:09,410 --> 00:51:09,420
context and everything changed
 

2667
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:11,990
context and everything changed
and so sometimes you do need to consider

2668
00:51:11,990 --> 00:51:12,000
and so sometimes you do need to consider
 

2669
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,150
and so sometimes you do need to consider
resume and stuff like that depending on

2670
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:14,160
resume and stuff like that depending on
 

2671
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,230
resume and stuff like that depending on
the

2672
00:51:15,230 --> 00:51:15,240
the
 

2673
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:17,270
the
but some I think people consider that

2674
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:17,280
but some I think people consider that
 

2675
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,670
but some I think people consider that
way too much especially in modern times

2676
00:51:19,670 --> 00:51:19,680
way too much especially in modern times
 

2677
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,290
way too much especially in modern times
I feel like

2678
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:21,300
I feel like
 

2679
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:23,569
I feel like
you don't need to go to college just for

2680
00:51:23,569 --> 00:51:23,579
you don't need to go to college just for
 

2681
00:51:23,579 --> 00:51:24,950
you don't need to go to college just for
the resume

2682
00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:24,960
the resume
 

2683
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,329
the resume
I feel like the biggest benefit of

2684
00:51:26,329 --> 00:51:26,339
I feel like the biggest benefit of
 

2685
00:51:26,339 --> 00:51:29,210
I feel like the biggest benefit of
college I mean there's a bunch but one

2686
00:51:29,210 --> 00:51:29,220
college I mean there's a bunch but one
 

2687
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:31,730
college I mean there's a bunch but one
is just do hard things but you could do

though like I think it's I chose
 

2727
00:52:15,059 --> 00:52:18,290

because I was like oh maybe I should
become an electrical engineer because I

2734
00:52:25,549 --> 00:52:25,559
become an electrical engineer because I
 

2735
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:27,829

00:54:06,770 --> 00:54:06,780
something off even when it was really
 

2821
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:08,329
something off even when it was really
difficult is

2822
00:54:08,329 --> 00:54:08,339
difficult is
 

2823
00:54:08,339 --> 00:54:11,030
difficult is
is very satisfying what was the

2824
00:54:11,030 --> 00:54:11,040
is very satisfying what was the
 

2825
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,349
is very satisfying what was the
difficult thing that you pulled off you

2826
00:54:12,349 --> 00:54:12,359
difficult thing that you pulled off you
 

2827
00:54:12,359 --> 00:54:15,290
difficult thing that you pulled off you
were like yeah this is cool I like

2828
00:54:15,290 --> 00:54:15,300
were like yeah this is cool I like
 

2829
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:17,750
were like yeah this is cool I like
working on jigsaw puzzles but I don't

2830
00:54:17,750 --> 00:54:17,760
working on jigsaw puzzles but I don't
 

2831
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:19,549
working on jigsaw puzzles but I don't
like how much table space they take up

2832
00:54:19,549 --> 00:54:19,559
like how much table space they take up
 

2833
00:54:19,559 --> 00:54:21,410
like how much table space they take up
because I like just have one big table

2834
00:54:21,410 --> 00:54:21,420
because I like just have one big table
 

2835
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:23,329
because I like just have one big table
where I can do it and that's also my

2836
00:54:23,329 --> 00:54:23,339
where I can do it and that's also my
 

2837
00:54:23,339 --> 00:54:24,410
where I can do it and that's also my
dining table

2838
00:54:24,410 --> 00:54:24,420
dining table
 

2839
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:27,410
dining table
so I made this mechanical table where

2840
00:54:27,410 --> 00:54:27,420
so I made this mechanical table where
 

2841
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:29,210
so I made this mechanical table where
you can switch between two table tops

2842
00:54:29,210 --> 00:54:29,220
you can switch between two table tops
 

2843
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:31,910
you can switch between two table tops
and that was an incredibly painful

2844
00:54:31,910 --> 00:54:31,920
and that was an incredibly painful
 

2845
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,950
and that was an incredibly painful
project and I'm really happy with the

2846
00:54:33,950 --> 00:54:33,960
project and I'm really happy with the
 

2847
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:35,809
project and I'm really happy with the
outcome and like so proud that I managed

2848
00:54:35,809 --> 00:54:35,819
outcome and like so proud that I managed
 

2849
00:54:35,819 --> 00:54:37,490
outcome and like so proud that I managed
to pull it off how does this wish table

2850
00:54:37,490 --> 00:54:37,500
to pull it off how does this wish table
 

2851
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:40,490
to pull it off how does this wish table
tops it's Tambor mechanism so like

2852
00:54:40,490 --> 00:54:40,500
tops it's Tambor mechanism so like
 

2853
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:42,170
tops it's Tambor mechanism so like
Tambor like you'll have on like old

2854
00:54:42,170 --> 00:54:42,180
Tambor like you'll have on like old
 

2855
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:44,750
Tambor like you'll have on like old
record player

2856
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:44,760
record player
 

2857
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:46,430
record player
um like it's these like thin Slots of

2858
00:54:46,430 --> 00:54:46,440
um like it's these like thin Slots of
 

2859
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:48,170
um like it's these like thin Slots of
wood with fabric on the back and you can

2860
00:54:48,170 --> 00:54:48,180
wood with fabric on the back and you can
 

2861
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:50,089
wood with fabric on the back and you can
kind of get them to go around curves so

2862
00:54:50,089 --> 00:54:50,099
kind of get them to go around curves so
 

2863
00:54:50,099 --> 00:54:52,309
kind of get them to go around curves so
basically one of the table tops or table

2864
00:54:52,309 --> 00:54:52,319
basically one of the table tops or table
 

2865
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:54,589
basically one of the table tops or table
surfaces is Tambor and then there's a

2866
00:54:54,589 --> 00:54:54,599
surfaces is Tambor and then there's a
 

2867
00:54:54,599 --> 00:54:56,210
surfaces is Tambor and then there's a
little crank and you can kind of roll it

2868
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:56,220
little crank and you can kind of roll it
 

2869
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:58,010
little crank and you can kind of roll it
off to the side and it reveals another

2870
00:54:58,010 --> 00:54:58,020
off to the side and it reveals another
 

2871
00:54:58,020 --> 00:55:00,049
off to the side and it reveals another
tabletop under it that you can then lift

2872
00:55:00,049 --> 00:55:00,059
tabletop under it that you can then lift
 

2873
00:55:00,059 --> 00:55:02,030
tabletop under it that you can then lift
up because it's on cams

2874
00:55:02,030 --> 00:55:02,040
up because it's on cams
 

2875
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:04,069
up because it's on cams
um so you can switch between the two I

2876
00:55:04,069 --> 00:55:04,079
um so you can switch between the two I
 

2877
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:07,069
um so you can switch between the two I
think that one was both really difficult

2878
00:55:07,069 --> 00:55:07,079
think that one was both really difficult
 

2879
00:55:07,079 --> 00:55:09,170
think that one was both really difficult
to pull off and it's also one of few

2880
00:55:09,170 --> 00:55:09,180
to pull off and it's also one of few
 

2881
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:11,630
to pull off and it's also one of few
projects that I use in my everyday life

2882
00:55:11,630 --> 00:55:11,640
projects that I use in my everyday life
 

2883
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:13,970
projects that I use in my everyday life
like I use it almost every day you know

built a chopping machine so it's a
 

2949
00:56:30,839 --> 00:56:32,809
built a chopping machine so it's a
machine that chops vegetables and has

they've probably been grown since I was
 

3297
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:31,010

then it kept on growing the parts that
 

3305
01:03:37,619 --> 01:03:38,809
then it kept on growing the parts that
they couldn't remove and I went through

3306
01:03:38,809 --> 01:03:38,819
they couldn't remove and I went through
 

3307
01:03:38,819 --> 01:03:41,210
they couldn't remove and I went through
radiation treatments so that was like

3308
01:03:41,210 --> 01:03:41,220
radiation treatments so that was like
 

3309
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:44,630

be what about the radiation treatment
 

3429
01:05:58,380 --> 01:06:01,069

so much more intense and it's such a
 

3447
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:23,150
so much more intense and it's such a
dramatic thing like going to the

3448

dramatic thing like going to the
 

3449
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:26,029
dramatic thing like going to the

I don't know and you feel so awful when
you wake up and but then the recovery

3454
01:06:30,950 --> 01:06:30,960
you wake up and but then the recovery
 

3455
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:32,870
you wake up and but then the recovery
from it was pretty linear like almost

3456
01:06:32,870 --> 01:06:32,880
from it was pretty linear like almost
 

3457
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:34,430
from it was pretty linear like almost
every week I would get a little bit

3458

better the thing about radiation is that
 

3461
01:06:37,859 --> 01:06:40,609
better the thing about radiation is that
it was not linear at all and it kind of

3462
01:06:40,609 --> 01:06:40,619
it was not linear at all and it kind of
 

3463
01:06:40,619 --> 01:06:43,670
it was not linear at all and it kind of
drained me in this weird like it was so

weird and that was honestly one of the
 

3511
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:39,349
weird and that was honestly one of the
scariest parts of it because that was

3512
01:07:39,349 --> 01:07:39,359
scariest parts of it because that was
 

3513
01:07:39,359 --> 01:07:41,270
scariest parts of it because that was
the first time where I felt like it

3514
01:07:41,270 --> 01:07:41,280
the first time where I felt like it
 

3515
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:44,390
the first time where I felt like it
genuinely affected my way of processing

3516
01:07:44,390 --> 01:07:44,400
genuinely affected my way of processing
 

3517
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:49,730
genuinely affected my way of processing
reality and yeah I was so relieved when

3518
01:07:49,730 --> 01:07:49,740
reality and yeah I was so relieved when
 

3519
01:07:49,740 --> 01:07:51,109
reality and yeah I was so relieved when
I found out that that was what was

3520
01:07:51,109 --> 01:07:51,119
I found out that that was what was
 

3521
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:52,430
I found out that that was what was
causing it because I felt like I was

3522
01:07:52,430 --> 01:07:52,440
causing it because I felt like I was
 

3523
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:54,650
causing it because I felt like I was
going crazy but even after surgery like

3524
01:07:54,650 --> 01:07:54,660
going crazy but even after surgery like
 

3525
01:07:54,660 --> 01:07:56,750
going crazy but even after surgery like
I woke up and I felt like myself like

3526
01:07:56,750 --> 01:07:56,760
I woke up and I felt like myself like
 

3527
01:07:56,760 --> 01:07:59,750
I woke up and I felt like myself like
everything was I got no brain injury so

3528
01:07:59,750 --> 01:07:59,760
everything was I got no brain injury so
 

3529
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:01,250
everything was I got no brain injury so
obviously this is like my experience

3530
01:08:01,250 --> 01:08:01,260
obviously this is like my experience
 

3531
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:02,990
obviously this is like my experience
from somebody who came out of it pretty

3532
01:08:02,990 --> 01:08:03,000
from somebody who came out of it pretty
 

3533
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,210
from somebody who came out of it pretty
unscathed who didn't get any brain

3534
01:08:05,210 --> 01:08:05,220
unscathed who didn't get any brain
 

3535
01:08:05,220 --> 01:08:06,829
unscathed who didn't get any brain
injuries and didn't have to do any of

3536
01:08:06,829 --> 01:08:06,839
injuries and didn't have to do any of
 

3537
01:08:06,839 --> 01:08:08,270
injuries and didn't have to do any of
that recovery it's more just the

3538
01:08:08,270 --> 01:08:08,280
that recovery it's more just the
 

3539
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:11,390
that recovery it's more just the
recovery from like the physical act of

3540
01:08:11,390 --> 01:08:11,400
recovery from like the physical act of
 

3541
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:14,450
recovery from like the physical act of
somebody cutting your skull open and

3542
01:08:14,450 --> 01:08:14,460
somebody cutting your skull open and
 

3543

01:24:51,770 --> 01:24:51,780
no it's like a lot of the products I
 

4379
01:24:51,780 --> 01:24:53,270
no it's like a lot of the products I
call them basket fillers like they're

4380
01:24:53,270 --> 01:24:53,280
call them basket fillers like they're
 

4381
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:54,649
call them basket fillers like they're
kind of just like stuff where I'm like

4382
01:24:54,649 --> 01:24:54,659
kind of just like stuff where I'm like
 

4383
01:24:54,659 --> 01:24:56,090
kind of just like stuff where I'm like
yeah this is like easy to throw into

4384
01:24:56,090 --> 01:24:56,100
yeah this is like easy to throw into
 

4385
01:24:56,100 --> 01:24:57,709
yeah this is like easy to throw into
your basket I mean we have these rings

4386
01:24:57,709 --> 01:24:57,719
your basket I mean we have these rings
 

4387
01:24:57,719 --> 01:24:59,450
your basket I mean we have these rings
I'm wearing them so there's a

4388
01:24:59,450 --> 01:24:59,460
I'm wearing them so there's a
 

4389
01:24:59,460 --> 01:25:00,770
I'm wearing them so there's a
screwdriver ring which is a Phillips

4390
01:25:00,770 --> 01:25:00,780
screwdriver ring which is a Phillips
 

4391
01:25:00,780 --> 01:25:02,870
screwdriver ring which is a Phillips
head screwdriver and then a screw ring

4392
01:25:02,870 --> 01:25:02,880
head screwdriver and then a screw ring
 

4393
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:04,610
head screwdriver and then a screw ring
that kind of has a recess like a

4394
01:25:04,610 --> 01:25:04,620
that kind of has a recess like a
 

4395
01:25:04,620 --> 01:25:06,709
that kind of has a recess like a
Phillips head screw I have these sawdust

4396
01:25:06,709 --> 01:25:06,719
Phillips head screw I have these sawdust
 

4397
01:25:06,719 --> 01:25:09,290
Phillips head screw I have these sawdust
socks that make you look like your feet

4398
01:25:09,290 --> 01:25:09,300
socks that make you look like your feet
 

4399
01:25:09,300 --> 01:25:10,729
socks that make you look like your feet
are covered in sawdust like you spent

4400
01:25:10,729 --> 01:25:10,739
are covered in sawdust like you spent
 

4401
01:25:10,739 --> 01:25:12,110
are covered in sawdust like you spent
all time in the all day in the shop

4402
01:25:12,110 --> 01:25:12,120
all time in the all day in the shop
 

4403
01:25:12,120 --> 01:25:13,970
all time in the all day in the shop
without having to put any of the actual

4404
01:25:13,970 --> 01:25:13,980
without having to put any of the actual
 

4405
01:25:13,980 --> 01:25:16,910
without having to put any of the actual
effort in but then

4406
01:25:16,910 --> 01:25:16,920
effort in but then
 

4407
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:19,430
effort in but then
we have four more products on the

4408
01:25:19,430 --> 01:25:19,440
we have four more products on the
 

4409
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:20,750
we have four more products on the
pipeline that we're working on and that

4410
01:25:20,750 --> 01:25:20,760
pipeline that we're working on and that
 

4411
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:23,149
pipeline that we're working on and that
are kind of the more the the big

4412
01:25:23,149 --> 01:25:23,159
are kind of the more the the big
 

4413
01:25:23,159 --> 01:25:24,470
are kind of the more the the big
ambitious

4414
01:25:24,470 --> 01:25:24,480
ambitious
 

4415
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:26,810
ambitious
products that are more in line with what

4416
01:25:26,810 --> 01:25:26,820
products that are more in line with what
 

4417
01:25:26,820 --> 01:25:28,370
products that are more in line with what
I want the brand to be like the tagline

4418
01:25:28,370 --> 01:25:28,380
I want the brand to be like the tagline
 

4419
01:25:28,380 --> 01:25:30,290
I want the brand to be like the tagline
is unique solutions to Everyday problems

4420
01:25:30,290 --> 01:25:30,300
is unique solutions to Everyday problems
 

4421
01:25:30,300 --> 01:25:35,270
is unique solutions to Everyday problems
and it's just a lot of like trying to

4422
01:25:35,270 --> 01:25:35,280
and it's just a lot of like trying to
 

4423
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:38,450
and it's just a lot of like trying to
develop novel takes on existing products

4424
01:25:38,450 --> 01:25:38,460
develop novel takes on existing products
 

4425
01:25:38,460 --> 01:25:39,890
develop novel takes on existing products
this is something where the function

4426
01:25:39,890 --> 01:25:39,900
this is something where the function
 

4427
01:25:39,900 --> 01:25:41,689
this is something where the function
becomes a bigger bigger part of the

4428
01:25:41,689 --> 01:25:41,699
becomes a bigger bigger part of the
 

4429
01:25:41,699 --> 01:25:44,450
becomes a bigger bigger part of the
design yeah so what's the process of

4430
01:25:44,450 --> 01:25:44,460
design yeah so what's the process of
 

4431
01:25:44,460 --> 01:25:45,709
design yeah so what's the process of
creating something like that like the

4432
01:25:45,709 --> 01:25:45,719
creating something like that like the
 

4433
01:25:45,719 --> 01:25:48,050
creating something like that like the
even the everyday calendar so like what

4434
01:25:48,050 --> 01:25:48,060
even the everyday calendar so like what
 

4435
01:25:48,060 --> 01:25:49,189
even the everyday calendar so like what
what are some challenges that are

4436
01:25:49,189 --> 01:25:49,199
what are some challenges that are
 

4437
01:25:49,199 --> 01:25:51,169
what are some challenges that are
interesting along the way so you have to

4438
01:25:51,169 --> 01:25:51,179
interesting along the way so you have to
 

4439
01:25:51,179 --> 01:25:52,850
interesting along the way so you have to
sketch it out you have to like

4440
01:25:52,850 --> 01:25:52,860
sketch it out you have to like
 

4441
01:25:52,860 --> 01:25:55,370
sketch it out you have to like
brainstorm draw things out and then

4442
01:25:55,370 --> 01:25:55,380
brainstorm draw things out and then
 

4443
01:25:55,380 --> 01:25:57,649
brainstorm draw things out and then
create a schematic and see like how how

4444
01:25:57,649 --> 01:25:57,659
create a schematic and see like how how
 

4445
01:25:57,659 --> 01:25:58,970
create a schematic and see like how how
do you know what it's going to look like

4446
01:25:58,970 --> 01:25:58,980
do you know what it's going to look like
 

4447
01:25:58,980 --> 01:26:02,990
do you know what it's going to look like
visually don't yeah and it's I mean I so

4448
01:26:02,990 --> 01:26:03,000
visually don't yeah and it's I mean I so
 

4449
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,330
visually don't yeah and it's I mean I so
the everyday calendar the first so I

4450
01:26:05,330 --> 01:26:05,340
the everyday calendar the first so I
 

4451
01:26:05,340 --> 01:26:07,669
the everyday calendar the first so I
just built it for myself first like that

4452
01:26:07,669 --> 01:26:07,679
just built it for myself first like that
 

4453
01:26:07,679 --> 01:26:10,669
just built it for myself first like that
did not come as a as a product idea

4454
01:26:10,669 --> 01:26:10,679
did not come as a as a product idea
 

4455
01:26:10,679 --> 01:26:12,590
did not come as a as a product idea
first and that's kind of been the

4456
01:26:12,590 --> 01:26:12,600
first and that's kind of been the
 

4457
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:13,790
first and that's kind of been the
process that I've had for a lot of

4458
01:26:13,790 --> 01:26:13,800
process that I've had for a lot of
 

4459
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:15,410
process that I've had for a lot of
things like I make it for myself and

4460
01:26:15,410 --> 01:26:15,420
things like I make it for myself and
 

4461
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:16,970
things like I make it for myself and
then I'm like oh maybe other people

4462
01:26:16,970 --> 01:26:16,980
then I'm like oh maybe other people
 

4463
01:26:16,980 --> 01:26:19,189
then I'm like oh maybe other people
would find this useful too so the

4464
01:26:19,189 --> 01:26:19,199
would find this useful too so the
 

4465
01:26:19,199 --> 01:26:21,110
would find this useful too so the
everyday calendar the first prototype I

4466
01:26:21,110 --> 01:26:21,120
everyday calendar the first prototype I
 

4467
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:22,129
everyday calendar the first prototype I
made

4468
01:26:22,129 --> 01:26:22,139
made
 

4469
01:26:22,139 --> 01:26:24,470
made
it had actually physical mechanical

4470
01:26:24,470 --> 01:26:24,480
it had actually physical mechanical
 

4471
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:27,470
it had actually physical mechanical
toggle switches so 365 toggle switches

4472
01:26:27,470 --> 01:26:27,480
toggle switches so 365 toggle switches
 

4473
01:26:27,480 --> 01:26:29,810
toggle switches so 365 toggle switches
that you could flip so if you worked out

4474
01:26:29,810 --> 01:26:29,820
that you could flip so if you worked out
 

4475
01:26:29,820 --> 01:26:31,370
that you could flip so if you worked out
that day or meditated for me was

4476
01:26:31,370 --> 01:26:31,380
that day or meditated for me was
 

4477
01:26:31,380 --> 01:26:32,689
that day or meditated for me was
meditating

4478
01:26:32,689 --> 01:26:32,699
meditating
 

4479
01:26:32,699 --> 01:26:34,610
meditating
um you can just flip that switch and

4480
01:26:34,610 --> 01:26:34,620
um you can just flip that switch and
 

4481
01:26:34,620 --> 01:26:36,590
um you can just flip that switch and
that was great but when I started

4482
01:26:36,590 --> 01:26:36,600
that was great but when I started
 

4483
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:40,129
that was great but when I started
evaluating it as a product it's

4484
01:26:40,129 --> 01:26:40,139
evaluating it as a product it's
 

4485
01:26:40,139 --> 01:26:42,410
evaluating it as a product it's
if you have 365 of something in a

4486
01:26:42,410 --> 01:26:42,420
if you have 365 of something in a
 

4487
01:26:42,420 --> 01:26:44,689
if you have 365 of something in a
product like The Runaway cost is crazy

4488
01:26:44,689 --> 01:26:44,699
product like The Runaway cost is crazy
 

4489
01:26:44,699 --> 01:26:49,129
product like The Runaway cost is crazy
so the cheapest option most reliable

4490
01:26:49,129 --> 01:26:49,139
so the cheapest option most reliable
 

4491
01:26:49,139 --> 01:26:50,689
so the cheapest option most reliable
option we could find was capacitive

4492
01:26:50,689 --> 01:26:50,699
option we could find was capacitive
 

4493
01:26:50,699 --> 01:26:53,030
option we could find was capacitive
touch so basically it's a touch

4494
01:26:53,030 --> 01:26:53,040
touch so basically it's a touch
 

4495
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:55,370
touch so basically it's a touch
interface and the front plate is the

4496
01:26:55,370 --> 01:26:55,380
interface and the front plate is the
 

4497
01:26:55,380 --> 01:26:57,890
interface and the front plate is the
circuit board itself so it's this like

4498
01:26:57,890 --> 01:26:57,900
circuit board itself so it's this like
 

4499
01:26:57,900 --> 01:27:00,169
circuit board itself so it's this like
this darkest word

4500
01:27:00,169 --> 01:27:00,179
this darkest word
 

4501
01:27:00,179 --> 01:27:03,530
this darkest word
um that's designed in this really

4502
01:27:03,530 --> 01:27:03,540
um that's designed in this really
 

4503
01:27:03,540 --> 01:27:06,229
um that's designed in this really
fancy way so it looks like a

4504
01:27:06,229 --> 01:27:06,239
fancy way so it looks like a
 

4505
01:27:06,239 --> 01:27:08,570
fancy way so it looks like a
a beautiful piece of art not to do my

4506
01:27:08,570 --> 01:27:08,580
a beautiful piece of art not to do my
 

4507
01:27:08,580 --> 01:27:11,209
a beautiful piece of art not to do my
own horn too much uh but it's actually a

4508
01:27:11,209 --> 01:27:11,219
own horn too much uh but it's actually a
 

4509
01:27:11,219 --> 01:27:12,350
own horn too much uh but it's actually a
circuit board

4510
01:27:12,350 --> 01:27:12,360
circuit board
 

4511
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:13,550
circuit board
um which I also thought was really

4512
01:27:13,550 --> 01:27:13,560
um which I also thought was really
 

4513
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:14,930
um which I also thought was really
interesting of like using this that

4514
01:27:14,930 --> 01:27:14,940
interesting of like using this that
 

4515
01:27:14,940 --> 01:27:18,050
interesting of like using this that
people usually hide away in in products

4516
01:27:18,050 --> 01:27:18,060
people usually hide away in in products
 

4517
01:27:18,060 --> 01:27:20,689
people usually hide away in in products
and it felt like a nod to my career in

4518
01:27:20,689 --> 01:27:20,699
and it felt like a nod to my career in
 

4519
01:27:20,699 --> 01:27:22,310
and it felt like a nod to my career in
electronics as well being like no let's

4520
01:27:22,310 --> 01:27:22,320
electronics as well being like no let's
 

4521
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:23,930
electronics as well being like no let's
make it pretty let's make it put it

4522
01:27:23,930 --> 01:27:23,940
make it pretty let's make it put it
 

4523
01:27:23,940 --> 01:27:26,090
make it pretty let's make it put it
front and forward

4524
01:27:26,090 --> 01:27:26,100
front and forward
 

4525
01:27:26,100 --> 01:27:26,750
front and forward
um

4526
01:27:26,750 --> 01:27:26,760
um
 

4527
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:28,970
um
but yeah I mean what I'm realizing now

4528
01:27:28,970 --> 01:27:28,980
but yeah I mean what I'm realizing now
 

4529
01:27:28,980 --> 01:27:30,530
but yeah I mean what I'm realizing now
more and more is like there's so many of

4530
01:27:30,530 --> 01:27:30,540
more and more is like there's so many of
 

4531
01:27:30,540 --> 01:27:31,970
more and more is like there's so many of
like I would love to turn the puzzle

4532
01:27:31,970 --> 01:27:31,980
like I would love to turn the puzzle
 

4533
01:27:31,980 --> 01:27:33,530
like I would love to turn the puzzle
table into a product

4534
01:27:33,530 --> 01:27:33,540
table into a product
 

4535
01:27:33,540 --> 01:27:35,209
table into a product
but then it's like that would be a seven

4536
01:27:35,209 --> 01:27:35,219
but then it's like that would be a seven
 

4537
01:27:35,219 --> 01:27:37,250
but then it's like that would be a seven
thousand dollar table and I don't want

4538
01:27:37,250 --> 01:27:37,260
thousand dollar table and I don't want
 

4539
01:27:37,260 --> 01:27:38,750
thousand dollar table and I don't want
to sell a table for seven thousand

4540
01:27:38,750 --> 01:27:38,760
to sell a table for seven thousand
 

4541
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:40,490
to sell a table for seven thousand
dollars so you're kind of limited to the

4542
01:27:40,490 --> 01:27:40,500
dollars so you're kind of limited to the
 

4543
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:42,050
dollars so you're kind of limited to the
price bracket you're in and it's like

4544
01:27:42,050 --> 01:27:42,060
price bracket you're in and it's like
 

4545
01:27:42,060 --> 01:27:45,350
price bracket you're in and it's like
your margins are tough like maintaining

4546
01:27:45,350 --> 01:27:45,360
your margins are tough like maintaining
 

4547
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:47,570
your margins are tough like maintaining
your margins are really really tough and

4548
01:27:47,570 --> 01:27:47,580
your margins are really really tough and
 

4549
01:27:47,580 --> 01:27:49,610
your margins are really really tough and
as somebody who's like I would love to

4550
01:27:49,610 --> 01:27:49,620
as somebody who's like I would love to
 

4551
01:27:49,620 --> 01:27:52,189
as somebody who's like I would love to
sell the stuff that we're doing cheaper

4552
01:27:52,189 --> 01:27:52,199
sell the stuff that we're doing cheaper
 

4553
01:27:52,199 --> 01:27:54,470
sell the stuff that we're doing cheaper
but you just it's just not feasible like

4554
01:27:54,470 --> 01:27:54,480
but you just it's just not feasible like
 

4555
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:56,530
but you just it's just not feasible like
you need those marches to survive and

4556
01:27:56,530 --> 01:27:56,540
you need those marches to survive and
 

4557
01:27:56,540 --> 01:27:59,209
you need those marches to survive and
well one of the the genius things in the

4558
01:27:59,209 --> 01:27:59,219
well one of the the genius things in the
 

4559
01:27:59,219 --> 01:28:00,890
well one of the the genius things in the
conversations I've had with Elon is the

4560
01:28:00,890 --> 01:28:00,900
conversations I've had with Elon is the
 

4561
01:28:00,900 --> 01:28:04,910
conversations I've had with Elon is the
ability through sort of systematic

4562
01:28:04,910 --> 01:28:04,920
ability through sort of systematic
 

4563
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:07,070
ability through sort of systematic
questioning of how things have been done

4564
01:28:07,070 --> 01:28:07,080
questioning of how things have been done
 

4565
01:28:07,080 --> 01:28:09,290
questioning of how things have been done
in the past to discuss what is the

4566
01:28:09,290 --> 01:28:09,300
in the past to discuss what is the
 

4567
01:28:09,300 --> 01:28:11,810
in the past to discuss what is the
lowest cost way to solve a problem

4568
01:28:11,810 --> 01:28:11,820
lowest cost way to solve a problem
 

4569
01:28:11,820 --> 01:28:14,330
lowest cost way to solve a problem
and so he's very good at getting to like

4570
01:28:14,330 --> 01:28:14,340
and so he's very good at getting to like
 

4571
01:28:14,340 --> 01:28:16,129
and so he's very good at getting to like
with Optimus robot for example the

4572
01:28:16,129 --> 01:28:16,139
with Optimus robot for example the
 

4573
01:28:16,139 --> 01:28:17,750
with Optimus robot for example the
humanoid robot how do you get the cost

4574
01:28:17,750 --> 01:28:17,760
humanoid robot how do you get the cost
 

4575
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:20,330
humanoid robot how do you get the cost
down yeah and that seems to be like one

4576
01:28:20,330 --> 01:28:20,340
down yeah and that seems to be like one
 

4577
01:28:20,340 --> 01:28:22,850
down yeah and that seems to be like one
of the essential things to do

4578
01:28:22,850 --> 01:28:22,860
of the essential things to do
 

4579
01:28:22,860 --> 01:28:25,610
of the essential things to do
in um in any product that you have to

4580
01:28:25,610 --> 01:28:25,620
in um in any product that you have to
 

4581
01:28:25,620 --> 01:28:28,010
in um in any product that you have to
mask manufacture is constantly discussed

4582
01:28:28,010 --> 01:28:28,020
mask manufacture is constantly discussed
 

4583
01:28:28,020 --> 01:28:29,750
mask manufacture is constantly discussed
like how do we simplify simplify it's

4584
01:28:29,750 --> 01:28:29,760
like how do we simplify simplify it's
 

4585
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:31,490
like how do we simplify simplify it's
definitely a design limitation that's

4586
01:28:31,490 --> 01:28:31,500
definitely a design limitation that's
 

4587
01:28:31,500 --> 01:28:33,290
definitely a design limitation that's
interesting it's both hard and

4588
01:28:33,290 --> 01:28:33,300
interesting it's both hard and
 

4589
01:28:33,300 --> 01:28:34,729
interesting it's both hard and
interesting to work within and that's

4590
01:28:34,729 --> 01:28:34,739
interesting to work within and that's
 

4591
01:28:34,739 --> 01:28:36,290
interesting to work within and that's
such a different thing as well it's like

4592
01:28:36,290 --> 01:28:36,300
such a different thing as well it's like
 

4593
01:28:36,300 --> 01:28:38,330
such a different thing as well it's like
as I talked about before like what is

4594
01:28:38,330 --> 01:28:38,340
as I talked about before like what is
 

4595
01:28:38,340 --> 01:28:39,890
as I talked about before like what is
the context and what you're creating

4596
01:28:39,890 --> 01:28:39,900
the context and what you're creating
 

4597
01:28:39,900 --> 01:28:41,330
the context and what you're creating
things like I'm still building things

4598
01:28:41,330 --> 01:28:41,340
things like I'm still building things
 

4599
01:28:41,340 --> 01:28:43,490
things like I'm still building things
I'm still inventing things but I changed

4600
01:28:43,490 --> 01:28:43,500
I'm still inventing things but I changed
 

4601
01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:45,050
I'm still inventing things but I changed
the contacts and has a very different

4602
01:28:45,050 --> 01:28:45,060
the contacts and has a very different
 

4603
01:28:45,060 --> 01:28:47,870
the contacts and has a very different
set of limitations and constantly trying

4604
01:28:47,870 --> 01:28:47,880
set of limitations and constantly trying
 

4605
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:50,750
set of limitations and constantly trying
to simplify your product to make it

4606
01:28:50,750 --> 01:28:50,760
to simplify your product to make it
 

4607
01:28:50,760 --> 01:28:54,110
to simplify your product to make it
cheaper and yeah it's a really

4608
01:28:54,110 --> 01:28:54,120
cheaper and yeah it's a really
 

4609
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:56,990
cheaper and yeah it's a really
interesting and different type of design

4610
01:28:56,990 --> 01:28:57,000
interesting and different type of design
 

4611
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:58,370
interesting and different type of design
process you can lose some of the magic

4612
01:28:58,370 --> 01:28:58,380
process you can lose some of the magic
 

4613
01:28:58,380 --> 01:29:00,530
process you can lose some of the magic
though right like

4614
01:29:00,530 --> 01:29:00,540
though right like
 

4615
01:29:00,540 --> 01:29:02,090
though right like
people can do that a little bit too much

4616
01:29:02,090 --> 01:29:02,100
people can do that a little bit too much
 

4617
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:04,189
people can do that a little bit too much
I think apple is famous like Johnny Ive

4618
01:29:04,189 --> 01:29:04,199
I think apple is famous like Johnny Ive
 

4619
01:29:04,199 --> 01:29:07,070
I think apple is famous like Johnny Ive
is famous for sort of focusing on design

4620
01:29:07,070 --> 01:29:07,080
is famous for sort of focusing on design
 

4621
01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:09,350
is famous for sort of focusing on design
first and not worrying about the cost

4622
01:29:09,350 --> 01:29:09,360
first and not worrying about the cost
 

4623
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:10,790
first and not worrying about the cost
later because you don't want to

4624
01:29:10,790 --> 01:29:10,800
later because you don't want to
 

4625
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:13,010
later because you don't want to
sacrifice there's some stuff that's

4626
01:29:13,010 --> 01:29:13,020
sacrifice there's some stuff that's
 

4627
01:29:13,020 --> 01:29:16,970
sacrifice there's some stuff that's
gonna cost more but it keeps yeah some

4628
01:29:16,970 --> 01:29:16,980
gonna cost more but it keeps yeah some
 

4629
01:29:16,980 --> 01:29:18,169
gonna cost more but it keeps yeah some
of the magic

4630
01:29:18,169 --> 01:29:18,179
of the magic
 

4631
01:29:18,179 --> 01:29:20,270
of the magic
I think is for some of the products that

4632
01:29:20,270 --> 01:29:20,280
I think is for some of the products that
 

4633
01:29:20,280 --> 01:29:21,770
I think is for some of the products that
we're working on it's like I'm like

4634
01:29:21,770 --> 01:29:21,780
we're working on it's like I'm like
 

4635
01:29:21,780 --> 01:29:23,689
we're working on it's like I'm like
let's just make it the best we think it

4636
01:29:23,689 --> 01:29:23,699
let's just make it the best we think it
 

4637
01:29:23,699 --> 01:29:25,610
let's just make it the best we think it
can be and then we can scale back from

4638
01:29:25,610 --> 01:29:25,620
can be and then we can scale back from
 

4639
01:29:25,620 --> 01:29:27,890
can be and then we can scale back from
there like just like let's not impose

4640
01:29:27,890 --> 01:29:27,900
there like just like let's not impose
 

4641
01:29:27,900 --> 01:29:29,689
there like just like let's not impose
these limitations on ourselves up front

4642
01:29:29,689 --> 01:29:29,699
these limitations on ourselves up front
 

4643
01:29:29,699 --> 01:29:31,790
these limitations on ourselves up front
like let's just make it the most

4644
01:29:31,790 --> 01:29:31,800
like let's just make it the most
 

4645
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:34,070
like let's just make it the most
beautiful version of itself and then we

4646
01:29:34,070 --> 01:29:34,080
beautiful version of itself and then we
 

4647
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:35,689
beautiful version of itself and then we
can decide what we want to compromise

4648
01:29:35,689 --> 01:29:35,699
can decide what we want to compromise
 

4649
01:29:35,699 --> 01:29:38,750
can decide what we want to compromise
with or compromise on yeah that's what I

4650
01:29:38,750 --> 01:29:38,760
with or compromise on yeah that's what I
 

4651
01:29:38,760 --> 01:29:41,530
with or compromise on yeah that's what I
say every day when I look in the mirror

4652
01:29:41,530 --> 01:29:41,540
say every day when I look in the mirror
 

4653
01:29:41,540 --> 01:29:44,270
say every day when I look in the mirror
it's beautiful and then we can

4654
01:29:44,270 --> 01:29:44,280
it's beautiful and then we can
 

4655
01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:47,770
it's beautiful and then we can
compromise yeah

4656
01:29:47,770 --> 01:29:47,780

 

4657
01:29:47,780 --> 01:29:51,169

yeah and see how [\h__\h] goes wrong later

4658
01:29:51,169 --> 01:29:51,179
yeah and see how [\h__\h] goes wrong later
 

4659
01:29:51,179 --> 01:29:53,930
yeah and see how [\h__\h] goes wrong later
all right all right uh back a little bit

4660
01:29:53,930 --> 01:29:53,940
all right all right uh back a little bit
 

4661
01:29:53,940 --> 01:29:57,709
all right all right uh back a little bit
to the robots just um or actually to one

4662
01:29:57,709 --> 01:29:57,719
to the robots just um or actually to one
 

4663
01:29:57,719 --> 01:29:59,510
to the robots just um or actually to one
of your more epic projects I mean

4664
01:29:59,510 --> 01:29:59,520
of your more epic projects I mean
 

4665
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:02,390
of your more epic projects I mean
they're all Epic but chocolate yeah

4666
01:30:02,390 --> 01:30:02,400
they're all Epic but chocolate yeah
 

4667
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:04,550
they're all Epic but chocolate yeah
you cutting into a Tesla and turning

4668
01:30:04,550 --> 01:30:04,560
you cutting into a Tesla and turning
 

4669
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:06,470
you cutting into a Tesla and turning
into an epic truck what was that like

4670
01:30:06,470 --> 01:30:06,480
into an epic truck what was that like
 

4671
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:08,209
into an epic truck what was that like
where did the idea come from

4672
01:30:08,209 --> 01:30:08,219
where did the idea come from
 

4673
01:30:08,219 --> 01:30:10,850
where did the idea come from
the idea came from that I really wanted

4674
01:30:10,850 --> 01:30:10,860
the idea came from that I really wanted
 

4675
01:30:10,860 --> 01:30:13,610
the idea came from that I really wanted
an electric pickup truck like I'm only

4676
01:30:13,610 --> 01:30:13,620
an electric pickup truck like I'm only
 

4677
01:30:13,620 --> 01:30:15,410
an electric pickup truck like I'm only
really driven electric because I got my

4678
01:30:15,410 --> 01:30:15,420
really driven electric because I got my
 

4679
01:30:15,420 --> 01:30:17,030
really driven electric because I got my
driver's license pretty late and I'm

4680
01:30:17,030 --> 01:30:17,040
driver's license pretty late and I'm
 

4681
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:19,610
driver's license pretty late and I'm
like one of the first generation drivers

4682
01:30:19,610 --> 01:30:19,620
like one of the first generation drivers
 

4683
01:30:19,620 --> 01:30:21,350
like one of the first generation drivers
it's like probably never gonna have a

4684
01:30:21,350 --> 01:30:21,360
it's like probably never gonna have a
 

4685
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:23,330
it's like probably never gonna have a
gas vehicle

4686
01:30:23,330 --> 01:30:23,340
gas vehicle
 

4687
01:30:23,340 --> 01:30:26,689
gas vehicle
um but yeah this was in 2018 as well

what are some of the challenges of doing
 

4709
01:30:55,500 --> 01:30:57,290
what are some of the challenges of doing
that it's unlike other projects you've

4710
01:30:57,290 --> 01:30:57,300
that it's unlike other projects you've
 

4711
01:30:57,300 --> 01:31:00,410
that it's unlike other projects you've

brought in a big team
 

4719
01:31:07,260 --> 01:31:09,649
brought in a big team
um and had another project manager for

4720
01:31:09,649 --> 01:31:09,659
um and had another project manager for
 

4721
01:31:09,659 --> 01:31:12,229
um and had another project manager for
it and stuff because also like cars you

4722
01:31:12,229 --> 01:31:12,239
it and stuff because also like cars you
 

4723

[\h__\h] around and make something that's
going to be really unsafe for me or for

4737
01:31:25,380 --> 01:31:26,930
so yeah I mean it was about a year of
planning

4738
01:31:26,930 --> 01:31:26,940
planning
 

4739
01:31:26,940 --> 01:31:29,330
planning
and then we got the car and then we

4740
01:31:29,330 --> 01:31:29,340
and then we got the car and then we
 

4741
01:31:29,340 --> 01:31:32,570
and then we got the car and then we
spent a month just tearing it apart and

4742
01:31:32,570 --> 01:31:32,580
spent a month just tearing it apart and
 

4743
01:31:32,580 --> 01:31:34,729
spent a month just tearing it apart and
trying to make it I was so set like I

4744
01:31:34,729 --> 01:31:34,739
trying to make it I was so set like I
 

4745
01:31:34,739 --> 01:31:36,770
trying to make it I was so set like I
really wanted the car just for its

4746
01:31:36,770 --> 01:31:36,780
really wanted the car just for its
 

4747
01:31:36,780 --> 01:31:39,830
really wanted the car just for its
function and

4748
01:31:39,830 --> 01:31:39,840
function and
 

4749
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:41,750
function and
I was like I'm so fine with if it's

4750
01:31:41,750 --> 01:31:41,760
I was like I'm so fine with if it's
 

4751
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:44,750
I was like I'm so fine with if it's
really ugly but then we managed to make

4752
01:31:44,750 --> 01:31:44,760
really ugly but then we managed to make
 

4753
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:46,669
really ugly but then we managed to make
it actually look really good so that

4755
01:31:46,679 --> 01:31:48,229
it actually look really good so that
wasn't part of the discussion like how

back to shitty robots you reused parts

4794
01:32:36,770 --> 01:32:36,780
back to shitty robots you reused parts
 

4795
01:32:36,780 --> 01:32:38,750
back to shitty robots you reused parts
of previous robots a lot what's like a

4796
01:32:38,750 --> 01:32:38,760
of previous robots a lot what's like a
 

4797
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:40,550
of previous robots a lot what's like a
memorable example of that it's just a

4798
01:32:40,550 --> 01:32:40,560
memorable example of that it's just a
 

4799
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:43,129
memorable example of that it's just a
graveyard of parts I mean it works out

4800
01:32:43,129 --> 01:32:43,139
graveyard of parts I mean it works out
 

4801

I've gotten better at keeping projects

4802
01:32:47,209 --> 01:32:47,219
I've gotten better at keeping projects
 

4803
01:32:47,219 --> 01:32:48,950
I've gotten better at keeping projects
intact in the beginning I used to

4804
01:32:48,950 --> 01:32:48,960
intact in the beginning I used to
 

4805
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:51,229
intact in the beginning I used to
disassemble every project because I was

4806
01:32:51,229 --> 01:32:51,239
disassemble every project because I was
 

4807
01:32:51,239 --> 01:32:53,270
disassemble every project because I was
also much a much more stringent budget

4808
01:32:53,270 --> 01:32:53,280
also much a much more stringent budget
 

4809

so if I needed a motor then I would like
 

4811
01:32:55,500 --> 01:32:57,890
so if I needed a motor then I would like
steal it off of an existing robot or

4812
01:32:57,890 --> 01:32:57,900
steal it off of an existing robot or
 

4813
01:32:57,900 --> 01:32:59,750
steal it off of an existing robot or
previous robot but I've got a really

4814
01:32:59,750 --> 01:32:59,760
previous robot but I've got a really
 

4815
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:03,290
previous robot but I've got a really
good at not doing that now

4816
01:33:03,290 --> 01:33:03,300
good at not doing that now
 

4817
01:33:03,300 --> 01:33:05,330
good at not doing that now
because I'm like maybe one day I want to

comments they did I put a dildo on it
 

4843
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:37,550
comments they did I put a dildo on it
yeah they have I have I mean was that

4844
01:33:37,550 --> 01:33:37,560
yeah they have I have I mean was that
 

4845
01:33:37,560 --> 01:33:39,950
yeah they have I have I mean was that
actually where you were gonna ask yeah I

4846
01:33:39,950 --> 01:33:39,960
actually where you were gonna ask yeah I
 

4847
01:33:39,960 --> 01:33:42,530
actually where you were gonna ask yeah I
have dildo written in my notes

4848
01:33:42,530 --> 01:33:42,540
have dildo written in my notes
 

4849
01:33:42,540 --> 01:33:46,010
have dildo written in my notes
I thought I just made it into a raunchy

4850
01:33:46,010 --> 01:33:46,020
I thought I just made it into a raunchy
 

4851
01:33:46,020 --> 01:33:47,990
I thought I just made it into a raunchy
punchline we're actually gonna get there

4852
01:33:47,990 --> 01:33:48,000
punchline we're actually gonna get there
 

4853
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:49,790
punchline we're actually gonna get there
yeah that was in the early days in the

4854
01:33:49,790 --> 01:33:49,800
yeah that was in the early days in the
 

4855
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:52,189
yeah that was in the early days in the
studio robot days but now I have a

4856
01:33:52,189 --> 01:33:52,199
studio robot days but now I have a
 

4857
01:33:52,199 --> 01:33:53,930
studio robot days but now I have a
filter on my YouTube channel for every

4858
01:33:53,930 --> 01:33:53,940
filter on my YouTube channel for every
 

4859
01:33:53,940 --> 01:33:57,950
filter on my YouTube channel for every
possible spelling of dildo so I mean

4860
01:33:57,950 --> 01:33:57,960
possible spelling of dildo so I mean
 

4861
01:33:57,960 --> 01:33:59,990
possible spelling of dildo so I mean
people want to probably sexualize robots

4862
01:33:59,990 --> 01:34:00,000
people want to probably sexualize robots
 

4863
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,270
people want to probably sexualize robots
right and then or or they put they want

4864
01:34:02,270 --> 01:34:02,280
right and then or or they put they want
 

4865
01:34:02,280 --> 01:34:04,729
right and then or or they put they want
to sexualize my relationship with them

4866
01:34:04,729 --> 01:34:04,739
to sexualize my relationship with them
 

4867
01:34:04,739 --> 01:34:08,030
to sexualize my relationship with them
yeah oh you know because I have majority

4868
01:34:08,030 --> 01:34:08,040
yeah oh you know because I have majority
 

4869
01:34:08,040 --> 01:34:11,629
yeah oh you know because I have majority
male followers and they're so sweet and

4870
01:34:11,629 --> 01:34:11,639
male followers and they're so sweet and
 

4871
01:34:11,639 --> 01:34:14,890
male followers and they're so sweet and
so receptive like respectful 99

4872
01:34:14,890 --> 01:34:14,900
so receptive like respectful 99
 

4873
01:34:14,900 --> 01:34:20,510
so receptive like respectful 99
but I realized like if there is a lot of

4874
01:34:20,510 --> 01:34:20,520

 

4875
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:23,390

I've realized that Society hasn't taught

4876
01:34:23,390 --> 01:34:23,400
I've realized that Society hasn't taught
 

4877
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:27,350
I've realized that Society hasn't taught
men how to have female role models and

4878
01:34:27,350 --> 01:34:27,360
men how to have female role models and
 

4879
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:30,590
men how to have female role models and
the way that people Channel it is

4880
01:34:30,590 --> 01:34:30,600
the way that people Channel it is
 

4881
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:32,030
the way that people Channel it is
through being like Oh it's because I

4882
01:34:32,030 --> 01:34:32,040
through being like Oh it's because I
 

4883
01:34:32,040 --> 01:34:33,649
through being like Oh it's because I
want to [\h__\h] her or I want to date her I

4884
01:34:33,649 --> 01:34:33,659
want to [\h__\h] her or I want to date her I
 

4885
01:34:33,659 --> 01:34:35,090
want to [\h__\h] her or I want to date her I
want to marry her

4886
01:34:35,090 --> 01:34:35,100
want to marry her
 

4887
01:34:35,100 --> 01:34:36,770
want to marry her
and I'm like I don't think you want any

4888
01:34:36,770 --> 01:34:36,780
and I'm like I don't think you want any
 

4889
01:34:36,780 --> 01:34:38,209
and I'm like I don't think you want any
of those things I think you actually

4890
01:34:38,209 --> 01:34:38,219
of those things I think you actually
 

4891
01:34:38,219 --> 01:34:40,910
of those things I think you actually
just admire my work but you don't know

4892
01:34:40,910 --> 01:34:40,920
just admire my work but you don't know
 

4893
01:34:40,920 --> 01:34:44,750
just admire my work but you don't know
how to look up to a woman yeah

4894
01:34:44,750 --> 01:34:44,760
how to look up to a woman yeah
 

4895
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:46,370
how to look up to a woman yeah
that's beautifully put

4896
01:34:46,370 --> 01:34:46,380
that's beautifully put
 

4897
01:34:46,380 --> 01:34:48,110
that's beautifully put
uh what about weapons do you give

4898
01:34:48,110 --> 01:34:48,120
uh what about weapons do you give
 

4899
01:34:48,120 --> 01:34:50,570
uh what about weapons do you give
requests to put weapons on a thing yeah

4900
01:34:50,570 --> 01:34:50,580
requests to put weapons on a thing yeah
 

4901
01:34:50,580 --> 01:34:52,669
requests to put weapons on a thing yeah
it's interesting I kind of started in

4902
01:34:52,669 --> 01:34:52,679
it's interesting I kind of started in
 

4903
01:34:52,679 --> 01:34:54,709
it's interesting I kind of started in
robotics that's just like a happy camper

4904
01:34:54,709 --> 01:34:54,719
robotics that's just like a happy camper
 

4905
01:34:54,719 --> 01:34:58,610
robotics that's just like a happy camper
who is really into like tinkering and

4906
01:34:58,610 --> 01:34:58,620
who is really into like tinkering and
 

4907
01:34:58,620 --> 01:35:00,770
who is really into like tinkering and
now I'm kind of seeing some of the

4908
01:35:00,770 --> 01:35:00,780
now I'm kind of seeing some of the
 

4909
01:35:00,780 --> 01:35:02,390
now I'm kind of seeing some of the
darker parts of it

4910
01:35:02,390 --> 01:35:02,400
darker parts of it
 

4911
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:04,550
darker parts of it
and I remember first time I went to a

4912
01:35:04,550 --> 01:35:04,560
and I remember first time I went to a
 

4913
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:06,890
and I remember first time I went to a
proper Factory and I saw like big

4914
01:35:06,890 --> 01:35:06,900
proper Factory and I saw like big
 

4915
01:35:06,900 --> 01:35:08,990
proper Factory and I saw like big
industrial robot arms at work and I was

4916
01:35:08,990 --> 01:35:09,000
industrial robot arms at work and I was
 

4917
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,330
industrial robot arms at work and I was
like oh well this is what it is about

4918
01:35:11,330 --> 01:35:11,340
like oh well this is what it is about
 

4919

like oh well this is what it is about
you know and it was almost scary where I

4920
01:35:13,910 --> 01:35:13,920
you know and it was almost scary where I
 

4921
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:16,010
you know and it was almost scary where I
was like oh I've just been like playing

and I'm like oh my God everybody
robotics is cool and fun and then you

4928
01:35:21,050 --> 01:35:21,060
robotics is cool and fun and then you
 

4929
01:35:21,060 --> 01:35:22,490
robotics is cool and fun and then you
get in there and you're like this is

4930
01:35:22,490 --> 01:35:22,500
get in there and you're like this is
 

4931
01:35:22,500 --> 01:35:25,970
get in there and you're like this is
kind of terrifying you were platforming

4932
01:35:25,970 --> 01:35:25,980
kind of terrifying you were platforming
 

4933
01:35:25,980 --> 01:35:29,330
kind of terrifying you were platforming
the very things that will destroy no

4934

4939
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:36,229
I'm the mouthpiece and I'm like getting
people into Robotics and engineering and

4940
01:35:36,229 --> 01:35:36,239
people into Robotics and engineering and
 

4941
01:35:36,239 --> 01:35:38,510
people into Robotics and engineering and
we're all just building our demise yeah

4942
01:35:38,510 --> 01:35:38,520
we're all just building our demise yeah
 

4943

we're all just building our demise yeah
accelerating speed no but I mean I had

4944
01:35:41,149 --> 01:35:41,159
accelerating speed no but I mean I had
 

4945
01:35:41,159 --> 01:35:43,610

4953
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:52,189
saying that they're never going to put
weapons on their robots and then have

4954
01:35:52,189 --> 01:35:52,199
weapons on their robots and then have
 

4955
01:35:52,199 --> 01:35:53,870
weapons on their robots and then have
military contracts and stuff like that

4956
01:35:53,870 --> 01:35:53,880
military contracts and stuff like that
 

4957

requests for it yeah drones are
 

4963
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:02,510
requests for it yeah drones are
terrifying especially they're [\h__\h]

4964

terrifying especially they're [\h__\h]
terrifying and it's really

4966
01:36:05,870 --> 01:36:05,880
terrifying and it's really
 

4967
01:36:05,880 --> 01:36:09,169
terrifying and it's really
everything I mean we're humans are so

4968
01:36:09,169 --> 01:36:09,179
everything I mean we're humans are so
 

4969
01:36:09,179 --> 01:36:12,169
everything I mean we're humans are so
good at creative ways of killing and

4970
01:36:12,169 --> 01:36:12,179
good at creative ways of killing and
 

4971
01:36:12,179 --> 01:36:14,510
good at creative ways of killing and
[\h__\h] each other it's like almost how

4975
01:36:18,659 --> 01:36:20,750
everything goes like and it's yeah I I'm
terrified of the future where we are

4976
01:36:20,750 --> 01:36:20,760
terrified of the future where we are
 

4977
01:36:20,760 --> 01:36:22,250
terrified of the future where we are
going to use more robust to kill each

4978
01:36:22,250 --> 01:36:22,260
going to use more robust to kill each
 

4979
01:36:22,260 --> 01:36:23,689
going to use more robust to kill each
other

4980

other
 

4981
01:36:23,699 --> 01:36:26,090
other
and come up with new new creative ways

4982
01:36:26,090 --> 01:36:26,100
and come up with new new creative ways
 

4983
01:36:26,100 --> 01:36:27,729
and come up with new new creative ways
to kill and hurt each other yeah

4984
01:36:27,729 --> 01:36:27,739
to kill and hurt each other yeah
 

4985
01:36:27,739 --> 01:36:29,990
to kill and hurt each other yeah
emotionally psychologically physically

4986

01:36:39,780 --> 01:36:42,169
our in language models and artificial
intelligence have you added speaking

4998
01:36:42,169 --> 01:36:42,179
intelligence have you added speaking
 

4999
01:36:42,179 --> 01:36:45,910
intelligence have you added speaking
capabilities to any of your devices

5000
01:36:45,910 --> 01:36:45,920
capabilities to any of your devices
 

5001
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:49,010
capabilities to any of your devices
yeah I used to have an Amazon Echo in my

5002
01:36:49,010 --> 01:36:49,020
yeah I used to have an Amazon Echo in my
 

5003
01:36:49,020 --> 01:36:51,410
yeah I used to have an Amazon Echo in my
house but then I removed it uh it just

5004
01:36:51,410 --> 01:36:51,420
house but then I removed it uh it just
 

5005
01:36:51,420 --> 01:36:53,629
house but then I removed it uh it just
freaked me out that I could whisper from

5006
01:36:53,629 --> 01:36:53,639
freaked me out that I could whisper from
 

5007
01:36:53,639 --> 01:36:55,970
freaked me out that I could whisper from
my bed and heard me yeah I'd be like

5008
01:36:55,970 --> 01:36:55,980
my bed and heard me yeah I'd be like
 

5009
01:36:55,980 --> 01:36:57,350
my bed and heard me yeah I'd be like
Alexa

5010
01:36:57,350 --> 01:36:57,360
Alexa
 

5011
01:36:57,360 --> 01:37:01,810
Alexa
play Spotify I feel like playing Spotify

5012
01:37:01,810 --> 01:37:01,820
play Spotify I feel like playing Spotify
 

5013
01:37:01,820 --> 01:37:03,530
play Spotify I feel like playing Spotify
uh

5014
01:37:03,530 --> 01:37:03,540
uh
 

5015
01:37:03,540 --> 01:37:05,870
uh
uh I

5016
01:37:05,870 --> 01:37:05,880
uh I
 

5017
01:37:05,880 --> 01:37:10,550
uh I
I think it is a powerful tool that we

5018
01:37:10,550 --> 01:37:10,560
I think it is a powerful tool that we
 

5019
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:13,669
I think it is a powerful tool that we
are not fully ready for yeah yeah and I

5020
01:37:13,669 --> 01:37:13,679
are not fully ready for yeah yeah and I
 

5021
01:37:13,679 --> 01:37:16,610
are not fully ready for yeah yeah and I
don't know I I think um the internet is

5022
01:37:16,610 --> 01:37:16,620
don't know I I think um the internet is
 

5023
01:37:16,620 --> 01:37:20,270
don't know I I think um the internet is
kind of a parade of us using

5024
01:37:20,270 --> 01:37:20,280
kind of a parade of us using
 

5025
01:37:20,280 --> 01:37:24,530
kind of a parade of us using
powerful things and harmful ways and I

5026
01:37:24,530 --> 01:37:24,540
powerful things and harmful ways and I
 

5027
01:37:24,540 --> 01:37:25,729
powerful things and harmful ways and I
think

5028
01:37:25,729 --> 01:37:25,739
think
 

5029
01:37:25,739 --> 01:37:28,430
think
chat Bots are really really exciting I'm

5030
01:37:28,430 --> 01:37:28,440
chat Bots are really really exciting I'm
 

5031
01:37:28,440 --> 01:37:30,350
chat Bots are really really exciting I'm
stoked to have a personal assistant

5032
01:37:30,350 --> 01:37:30,360
stoked to have a personal assistant
 

5033
01:37:30,360 --> 01:37:32,689
stoked to have a personal assistant
that's like a virtual assistant that

5034
01:37:32,689 --> 01:37:32,699
that's like a virtual assistant that
 

5035
01:37:32,699 --> 01:37:34,850
that's like a virtual assistant that
actually does a good job and can solve

5036
01:37:34,850 --> 01:37:34,860
actually does a good job and can solve
 

5037
01:37:34,860 --> 01:37:36,169
actually does a good job and can solve
problems for me

5038
01:37:36,169 --> 01:37:36,179
problems for me
 

5039
01:37:36,179 --> 01:37:38,030
problems for me
but

5040
01:37:38,030 --> 01:37:38,040
but
 

5041
01:37:38,040 --> 01:37:39,890
but
yeah it also feels like it can get dark

5042
01:37:39,890 --> 01:37:39,900
yeah it also feels like it can get dark
 

5043
01:37:39,900 --> 01:37:41,990
yeah it also feels like it can get dark
really really quickly yeah because uh

5044
01:37:41,990 --> 01:37:42,000
really really quickly yeah because uh
 

5045
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:43,610
really really quickly yeah because uh
you can form close connections like

5046
01:37:43,610 --> 01:37:43,620
you can form close connections like
 

5047
01:37:43,620 --> 01:37:45,169
you can form close connections like
we're talking about with it and then it

5048
01:37:45,169 --> 01:37:45,179
we're talking about with it and then it
 

5049
01:37:45,179 --> 01:37:46,930
we're talking about with it and then it
can be used to manipulate you

5050
01:37:46,930 --> 01:37:46,940
can be used to manipulate you
 

5051
01:37:46,940 --> 01:37:51,050
can be used to manipulate you
manipulate you in terms of what is true

5052
01:37:51,050 --> 01:37:51,060
manipulate you in terms of what is true
 

5053
01:37:51,060 --> 01:37:53,270
manipulate you in terms of what is true
and manipulating in terms of getting you

5054
01:37:53,270 --> 01:37:53,280
and manipulating in terms of getting you
 

5055
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:57,229
and manipulating in terms of getting you
to buy stuff yeah or um maybe because at

5056
01:37:57,229 --> 01:37:57,239
to buy stuff yeah or um maybe because at
 

5057
01:37:57,239 --> 01:37:59,090
to buy stuff yeah or um maybe because at
least for now it's centralized getting

5058
01:37:59,090 --> 01:37:59,100
least for now it's centralized getting
 

5059
01:37:59,100 --> 01:38:01,129
least for now it's centralized getting
everybody to think the same way I mean

5060
01:38:01,129 --> 01:38:01,139
everybody to think the same way I mean
 

5061
01:38:01,139 --> 01:38:02,750
everybody to think the same way I mean
for I mean it's the same in like

5062
01:38:02,750 --> 01:38:02,760
for I mean it's the same in like
 

5063
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:04,669
for I mean it's the same in like
algorithms being used to radicalize

5064
01:38:04,669 --> 01:38:04,679
algorithms being used to radicalize
 

5065
01:38:04,679 --> 01:38:06,590
algorithms being used to radicalize
people or kind of having that as a

5066
01:38:06,590 --> 01:38:06,600
people or kind of having that as a
 

5067
01:38:06,600 --> 01:38:08,750
people or kind of having that as a
consequence of the way that they work

5068
01:38:08,750 --> 01:38:08,760
consequence of the way that they work
 

5069
01:38:08,760 --> 01:38:11,750
consequence of the way that they work
and combine that with a really Advanced

5070
01:38:11,750 --> 01:38:11,760
and combine that with a really Advanced
 

5071
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:14,530
and combine that with a really Advanced
language model and like you can

5072
01:38:14,530 --> 01:38:14,540
language model and like you can
 

5073
01:38:14,540 --> 01:38:17,450
language model and like you can
control people's world view in a way

5074
01:38:17,450 --> 01:38:17,460
control people's world view in a way
 

5075
01:38:17,460 --> 01:38:20,390
control people's world view in a way
that you could I mean it's just

5076
01:38:20,390 --> 01:38:20,400
that you could I mean it's just
 

5077
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:22,610
that you could I mean it's just
it's it's wild and I think we're not

5078
01:38:22,610 --> 01:38:22,620
it's it's wild and I think we're not
 

5079
01:38:22,620 --> 01:38:25,010
it's it's wild and I think we're not
ready for it and I don't know if we ever

5080
01:38:25,010 --> 01:38:25,020
ready for it and I don't know if we ever
 

5081
01:38:25,020 --> 01:38:26,750
ready for it and I don't know if we ever
would be because we're

5082
01:38:26,750 --> 01:38:26,760
would be because we're
 

5083
01:38:26,760 --> 01:38:29,169
would be because we're
very impressionable a little squishy

5084
01:38:29,169 --> 01:38:29,179
very impressionable a little squishy
 

5085
01:38:29,179 --> 01:38:32,330
very impressionable a little squishy
flashbacks which takes us back to the

5086
01:38:32,330 --> 01:38:32,340
flashbacks which takes us back to the
 

5087
01:38:32,340 --> 01:38:34,850
flashbacks which takes us back to the
one the squishy flash flashbags interact

5088
01:38:34,850 --> 01:38:34,860
one the squishy flash flashbags interact
 

5089
01:38:34,860 --> 01:38:38,890
one the squishy flash flashbags interact
which one pops first still um

5090
01:38:38,890 --> 01:38:38,900

 

5091
01:38:38,900 --> 01:38:42,290

Bubble new people paper coming out like

5092
01:38:42,290 --> 01:38:42,300
Bubble new people paper coming out like
 

5093
01:38:42,300 --> 01:38:45,350
Bubble new people paper coming out like
three minutes talking about oh

5094
01:38:45,350 --> 01:38:45,360
three minutes talking about oh
 

5095
01:38:45,360 --> 01:38:47,750
three minutes talking about oh
um what about consciousness

5096
01:38:47,750 --> 01:38:47,760
um what about consciousness
 

5097
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:50,510
um what about consciousness
so you never anthropomorphize the robots

5098
01:38:50,510 --> 01:38:50,520
so you never anthropomorphize the robots
 

5099
01:38:50,520 --> 01:38:53,990
so you never anthropomorphize the robots
did they ever come to life for you

5100
01:38:53,990 --> 01:38:54,000
did they ever come to life for you
 

5101
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,149
did they ever come to life for you
where you kind of thought no because

5102
01:38:56,149 --> 01:38:56,159
where you kind of thought no because
 

5103
01:38:56,159 --> 01:38:57,770
where you kind of thought no because
they built them and I know how they work

5104
01:38:57,770 --> 01:38:57,780
they built them and I know how they work
 

5105
01:38:57,780 --> 01:39:00,050
they built them and I know how they work
so that prevents you from being able to

5106
01:39:00,050 --> 01:39:00,060
so that prevents you from being able to
 

5107
01:39:00,060 --> 01:39:02,390
so that prevents you from being able to
see the magic I don't know yeah but I

5108
01:39:02,390 --> 01:39:02,400
see the magic I don't know yeah but I
 

5109
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:03,770
see the magic I don't know yeah but I
think it's like

5110
01:39:03,770 --> 01:39:03,780
think it's like
 

5111
01:39:03,780 --> 01:39:06,169
think it's like
I definitely when I did a lot of the

5112
01:39:06,169 --> 01:39:06,179
I definitely when I did a lot of the
 

5113
01:39:06,179 --> 01:39:08,030
I definitely when I did a lot of the
shitty robot stuff like I wanted them to

5114
01:39:08,030 --> 01:39:08,040
shitty robot stuff like I wanted them to
 

5115
01:39:08,040 --> 01:39:11,030
shitty robot stuff like I wanted them to
move like a human or like in a more

5116
01:39:11,030 --> 01:39:11,040
move like a human or like in a more
 

5117
01:39:11,040 --> 01:39:13,250
move like a human or like in a more
organic way and not just like point A to

5118
01:39:13,250 --> 01:39:13,260
organic way and not just like point A to
 

5119
01:39:13,260 --> 01:39:15,050
organic way and not just like point A to
point B which is the easiest way to

5120
01:39:15,050 --> 01:39:15,060
point B which is the easiest way to
 

5121
01:39:15,060 --> 01:39:16,669
point B which is the easiest way to
program stuff

5122
01:39:16,669 --> 01:39:16,679
program stuff
 

5123
01:39:16,679 --> 01:39:18,649
program stuff
um so I wanted other people to

5124
01:39:18,649 --> 01:39:18,659
um so I wanted other people to
 

5125
01:39:18,659 --> 01:39:20,330
um so I wanted other people to
anthropomorphize them but I don't think

5126
01:39:20,330 --> 01:39:20,340
anthropomorphize them but I don't think
 

5127
01:39:20,340 --> 01:39:22,430
anthropomorphize them but I don't think
I I did necessarily

5128
01:39:22,430 --> 01:39:22,440
I I did necessarily
 

5129
01:39:22,440 --> 01:39:24,830
I I did necessarily
I am trying to think of a piece of

5130
01:39:24,830 --> 01:39:24,840
I am trying to think of a piece of
 

5131
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:26,570
I am trying to think of a piece of
technology that I've

5132
01:39:26,570 --> 01:39:26,580
technology that I've
 

5133
01:39:26,580 --> 01:39:29,390
technology that I've
kind of projected feelings upon but no I

5134
01:39:29,390 --> 01:39:29,400
kind of projected feelings upon but no I
 

5135
01:39:29,400 --> 01:39:32,649
kind of projected feelings upon but no I
can't so sometimes what makes me

5136
01:39:32,649 --> 01:39:32,659
can't so sometimes what makes me
 

5137
01:39:32,659 --> 01:39:34,550
can't so sometimes what makes me
anthropomorphize something even though I

5138
01:39:34,550 --> 01:39:34,560
anthropomorphize something even though I
 

5139
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:36,290
anthropomorphize something even though I
built it is uh

5140
01:39:36,290 --> 01:39:36,300
built it is uh
 

5141
01:39:36,300 --> 01:39:39,410
built it is uh
there's a element surprise so especially

5142
01:39:39,410 --> 01:39:39,420
there's a element surprise so especially
 

5143
01:39:39,420 --> 01:39:41,209
there's a element surprise so especially
with machine learning you're surprised

5144
01:39:41,209 --> 01:39:41,219
with machine learning you're surprised
 

5145
01:39:41,219 --> 01:39:43,910
with machine learning you're surprised
by the kind of things it does have you

5146
01:39:43,910 --> 01:39:43,920
by the kind of things it does have you
 

5147
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:46,490
by the kind of things it does have you
ever been surprised by a robot

5148
01:39:46,490 --> 01:39:46,500
ever been surprised by a robot
 

5149
01:39:46,500 --> 01:39:48,709
ever been surprised by a robot
no because they're all pretty dumb like

5150
01:39:48,709 --> 01:39:48,719
no because they're all pretty dumb like
 

5151
01:39:48,719 --> 01:39:52,189
no because they're all pretty dumb like
also the robots I built it's like

5152
01:39:52,189 --> 01:39:52,199
also the robots I built it's like
 

5153
01:39:52,199 --> 01:39:56,750
also the robots I built it's like
they're all just servos moving from I

5154
01:39:56,750 --> 01:39:56,760

mean they're
 

5157
01:39:57,780 --> 01:40:01,010
mean they're
I don't think I've built anything with a

5158
01:40:01,010 --> 01:40:01,020
I don't think I've built anything with a
 

5159
01:40:01,020 --> 01:40:03,050
I don't think I've built anything with a
huge amount of sensors or like they're

5160
01:40:03,050 --> 01:40:03,060
huge amount of sensors or like they're
 

5161
01:40:03,060 --> 01:40:04,970
huge amount of sensors or like they're
just moving in a pattern that I program

5162
01:40:04,970 --> 01:40:04,980
just moving in a pattern that I program
 

5163
01:40:04,980 --> 01:40:07,729
just moving in a pattern that I program
them to move what's the most complex

5164
01:40:07,729 --> 01:40:07,739
them to move what's the most complex
 

5165
01:40:07,739 --> 01:40:09,830
them to move what's the most complex
thing you've built

5166
01:40:09,830 --> 01:40:09,840
thing you've built
 

5167
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:13,430

I mean probably truckload yeah was

5168
01:40:13,430 --> 01:40:13,440
I mean probably truckload yeah was
 

5169
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:15,470
I mean probably truckload yeah was
complex just for the sheer scale of it

5170
01:40:15,470 --> 01:40:15,480
complex just for the sheer scale of it
 

5171
01:40:15,480 --> 01:40:17,570
complex just for the sheer scale of it
and like the

5172
01:40:17,570 --> 01:40:17,580

5178
01:40:24,290 --> 01:40:24,300
also in terms of impact that it had like
 

5179

5445
01:45:52,860 --> 01:45:55,850
placed in like a small City with almost
no foreigners it was just a constant

5446
01:45:55,850 --> 01:45:55,860
no foreigners it was just a constant
 

5447
01:45:55,860 --> 01:45:57,530
no foreigners it was just a constant
audience of people staring at you

5448
01:45:57,530 --> 01:45:57,540
audience of people staring at you
 

5449
01:45:57,540 --> 01:45:58,669
audience of people staring at you
because

5450
01:45:58,669 --> 01:45:58,679
because
 

5451
01:45:58,679 --> 01:46:01,189
because
they haven't interacted with a lot of

5452
01:46:01,189 --> 01:46:01,199
they haven't interacted with a lot of
 

5453
01:46:01,199 --> 01:46:05,450
they haven't interacted with a lot of
foreigners before and yeah I definitely

5454
01:46:05,450 --> 01:46:05,460
foreigners before and yeah I definitely

and then after that I moved to Kenya

5456
01:46:08,390 --> 01:46:08,400
and then after that I moved to Kenya
 

5457
01:46:08,400 --> 01:46:10,490
and then after that I moved to Kenya
and

5458
01:46:10,490 --> 01:46:10,500
and
 

5459
01:46:10,500 --> 01:46:12,410
and
I think that was one of the reasons why

5460
01:46:12,410 --> 01:46:12,420
I think that was one of the reasons why
 

5461
01:46:12,420 --> 01:46:14,270
I think that was one of the reasons why
it was so interesting to move to the

5462
01:46:14,270 --> 01:46:14,280
it was so interesting to move to the
 

5463
01:46:14,280 --> 01:46:16,490
it was so interesting to move to the

5531
01:47:36,239 --> 01:47:38,689
my stay there which I think was 100 the
right decision of them to make but I

5532
01:47:38,689 --> 01:47:38,699
right decision of them to make but I
 

5533
01:47:38,699 --> 01:47:41,270
right decision of them to make but I
kind of came home to a house that was

5534
01:47:41,270 --> 01:47:41,280
kind of came home to a house that was
 

5535
01:47:41,280 --> 01:47:43,970
kind of came home to a house that was
starting to get picked apart and

5536
01:47:43,970 --> 01:47:43,980
starting to get picked apart and
 

5537
01:47:43,980 --> 01:47:47,149
starting to get picked apart and
a big shock to your world it was both

5538
01:47:47,149 --> 01:47:47,159
a big shock to your world it was both
 

5539
01:47:47,159 --> 01:47:49,430
a big shock to your world it was both
yes and no

01:47:49,430 --> 01:47:49,440
yes and no
 

5541
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:51,590
yes and no
I think I remember I just sat down on my

5542
01:47:51,590 --> 01:47:51,600
I think I remember I just sat down on my
 

5543
01:47:51,600 --> 01:47:53,810
I think I remember I just sat down on my
bed and I was like well this isn't what

5544
01:47:53,810 --> 01:47:53,820
bed and I was like well this isn't what
 

5545
01:47:53,820 --> 01:47:56,750
bed and I was like well this isn't what
I expected but I guess I'll move to

5546
01:47:56,750 --> 01:47:56,760
I expected but I guess I'll move to
 

5547
01:47:56,760 --> 01:47:59,090
I expected but I guess I'll move to
Kenya because I was one of the few there

5548
01:47:59,090 --> 01:47:59,100
Kenya because I was one of the few there
 

5549
01:47:59,100 --> 01:48:00,770
Kenya because I was one of the few there
were a few Swedish boarding schools in

5550
01:48:00,770 --> 01:48:00,780
were a few Swedish boarding schools in
 

5551
01:48:00,780 --> 01:48:02,270
were a few Swedish boarding schools in
the world there was one in Brussels

5552
01:48:02,270 --> 01:48:02,280
the world there was one in Brussels
 

5553
01:48:02,280 --> 01:48:05,570
the world there was one in Brussels
Paris London and then one in Nairobi and

5554
01:48:05,570 --> 01:48:05,580
Paris London and then one in Nairobi and
 

5555
01:48:05,580 --> 01:48:06,530
Paris London and then one in Nairobi and
I didn't want to miss more school

5556
01:48:06,530 --> 01:48:06,540
I didn't want to miss more school
 

5557
01:48:06,540 --> 01:48:08,149
I didn't want to miss more school
because I'd taken a gap year when I went

5558
01:48:08,149 --> 01:48:08,159
because I'd taken a gap year when I went
 

5559
01:48:08,159 --> 01:48:09,410
because I'd taken a gap year when I went
to China

5560
01:48:09,410 --> 01:48:09,420
to China
 

5561
01:48:09,420 --> 01:48:12,050
to China
so I was like I guess I'll go to Nairobi

5562
01:48:12,050 --> 01:48:12,060
so I was like I guess I'll go to Nairobi
 

5563
01:48:12,060 --> 01:48:14,209
so I was like I guess I'll go to Nairobi
and I'm thinking now like I I think if

5564
01:48:14,209 --> 01:48:14,219
and I'm thinking now like I I think if
 

5565
01:48:14,219 --> 01:48:16,129
and I'm thinking now like I I think if
my parents had stayed together granted

5566
01:48:16,129 --> 01:48:16,139
my parents had stayed together granted
 

5567
01:48:16,139 --> 01:48:17,810
my parents had stayed together granted
it was amazing that they they did made

5568
01:48:17,810 --> 01:48:17,820
it was amazing that they they did made
 

5569
01:48:17,820 --> 01:48:21,410
it was amazing that they they did made
the right decision in every way but I my

5570
01:48:21,410 --> 01:48:21,420
the right decision in every way but I my
 

5571
01:48:21,420 --> 01:48:24,550
the right decision in every way but I my
roots kind of never grew back after that

5572
01:48:24,550 --> 01:48:24,560
roots kind of never grew back after that
 

5573
01:48:24,560 --> 01:48:26,270
roots kind of never grew back after that
and

5574
01:48:26,270 --> 01:48:26,280
and
 

5575
01:48:26,280 --> 01:48:28,850
and
I think I just kept on moving abroad and

5576
01:48:28,850 --> 01:48:28,860
I think I just kept on moving abroad and
 

5577
01:48:28,860 --> 01:48:31,310
I think I just kept on moving abroad and
moving around and being really restless

5578
01:48:31,310 --> 01:48:31,320
moving around and being really restless
 

5579
01:48:31,320 --> 01:48:32,570
moving around and being really restless
and

5580
01:48:32,570 --> 01:48:32,580

01:48:36,109 --> 01:48:36,119

01:48:42,169 --> 01:48:42,179

 

5589
01:48:42,179 --> 01:48:44,689

in the people around me and I have I

5590
01:48:44,689 --> 01:48:44,699
in the people around me and I have I
 

5591
01:48:44,699 --> 01:48:46,370
in the people around me and I have I
have a lot of different homes you know

5592
01:48:46,370 --> 01:48:46,380
have a lot of different homes you know
 

5593
01:48:46,380 --> 01:48:48,169
have a lot of different homes you know
it's

5594
01:48:48,169 --> 01:48:48,179
it's
 

5595
01:48:48,179 --> 01:48:49,729
it's
I think what I'm realizing more and more

5596
01:48:49,729 --> 01:48:49,739
I think what I'm realizing more and more
 

5597
01:48:49,739 --> 01:48:51,169
I think what I'm realizing more and more
is like you cannot live without

5598
01:48:51,169 --> 01:48:51,179
is like you cannot live without
 

5599
01:48:51,179 --> 01:48:53,990
is like you cannot live without
consequence and compromise and sometimes

5600
01:48:53,990 --> 01:48:54,000
consequence and compromise and sometimes
 

5601
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,510
consequence and compromise and sometimes
I can envy people who have that like

5602
01:48:56,510 --> 01:48:56,520
I can envy people who have that like
 

5603
01:48:56,520 --> 01:48:58,189
I can envy people who have that like
same friend group that they had their

5604
01:48:58,189 --> 01:48:58,199
same friend group that they had their
 

5605
01:48:58,199 --> 01:49:01,510
same friend group that they had their
entire life or that you know just really

5606
01:49:01,510 --> 01:49:01,520
entire life or that you know just really
 

5607
01:49:01,520 --> 01:49:04,609
entire life or that you know just really
belong in a place

5608
01:49:04,609 --> 01:49:04,619
belong in a place
 

5609
01:49:04,619 --> 01:49:07,250
belong in a place
and I realized that would be amazing but

5610
01:49:07,250 --> 01:49:07,260
and I realized that would be amazing but
 

5611
01:49:07,260 --> 01:49:10,129
and I realized that would be amazing but
I've chosen different experiences

5612
01:49:10,129 --> 01:49:10,139
I've chosen different experiences
 

5613
01:49:10,139 --> 01:49:12,770
I've chosen different experiences
and one of the upsides of that is I can

5614
01:49:12,770 --> 01:49:12,780
and one of the upsides of that is I can
 

5615
01:49:12,780 --> 01:49:14,870
and one of the upsides of that is I can
feel home almost anywhere

5616
01:49:14,870 --> 01:49:14,880
feel home almost anywhere
 

5617
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:17,030
feel home almost anywhere
one of the downsides of that is that I

5618
01:49:17,030 --> 01:49:17,040
one of the downsides of that is that I
 

5619
01:49:17,040 --> 01:49:20,510
one of the downsides of that is that I
cannot feel fully at home anywhere

5620
01:49:20,510 --> 01:49:20,520

5700
01:51:05,390 --> 01:51:05,400
and just because something is boring
 

5701
01:51:05,400 --> 01:51:07,189
and just because something is boring
doesn't mean that it's important

5702
01:51:07,189 --> 01:51:07,199
doesn't mean that it's important
 

5703
01:51:07,199 --> 01:51:08,810
doesn't mean that it's important
I

5704
01:51:08,810 --> 01:51:08,820
I
 

5705
01:51:08,820 --> 01:51:10,910

but school doesn't really teach us how

5710
01:51:17,810 --> 01:51:17,820
but school doesn't really teach us how
 

5711
01:51:17,820 --> 01:51:19,910
but school doesn't really teach us how
to stay excited about something and how

5712
01:51:19,910 --> 01:51:19,920
to stay excited about something and how
 

5713
01:51:19,920 --> 01:51:21,590
to stay excited about something and how
to stay enthusiastic about something and

5714
01:51:21,590 --> 01:51:21,600
to stay enthusiastic about something and
 

5715
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:24,350
to stay enthusiastic about something and
if you can find that then like you got a

5716
01:51:24,350 --> 01:51:24,360
if you can find that then like you got a
 

5717
01:51:24,360 --> 01:51:27,109
if you can find that then like you got a
gold mine of potential

5718
01:51:27,109 --> 01:51:27,119
gold mine of potential
 

5719
01:51:27,119 --> 01:51:28,609
gold mine of potential
so

5720
01:51:28,609 --> 01:51:28,619
so
 

5721
01:51:28,619 --> 01:51:31,430
so
I kind of had to reprogram myself to be

5722
01:51:31,430 --> 01:51:31,440
I kind of had to reprogram myself to be
 

5723
01:51:31,440 --> 01:51:33,290
I kind of had to reprogram myself to be
like just because this is fun doesn't

like just because this is fun doesn't
mean that it's not important

5726
01:51:35,750 --> 01:51:35,760
mean that it's not important
 

5727
01:51:35,760 --> 01:51:38,750
mean that it's not important
because I had so much guilt about it in

01:51:38,750 --> 01:51:38,760
because I had so much guilt about it in
 

5729
01:51:38,760 --> 01:51:40,490
because I had so much guilt about it in
this weird way or where I'm like no this

5730
01:51:40,490 --> 01:51:40,500
this weird way or where I'm like no this

just because it's boring and hard
 

5741
01:51:52,080 --> 01:51:53,870
just because it's boring and hard
doesn't mean it's the right thing to do

5742
01:51:53,870 --> 01:51:53,880
doesn't mean it's the right thing to do
