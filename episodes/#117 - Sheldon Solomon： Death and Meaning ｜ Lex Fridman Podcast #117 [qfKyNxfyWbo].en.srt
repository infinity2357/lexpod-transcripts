00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,350
wow one of the reasons why i'm finding
this so compelling is that it squares

826
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:21,360
this so compelling is that it squares
 

827
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,509
this so compelling is that it squares
with my own personal experience

828
00:15:23,509 --> 00:15:23,519
with my own personal experience
 

829
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,629
with my own personal experience
and then to make a short story long and

830
00:15:26,629 --> 00:15:26,639
and then to make a short story long and
 

831
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,629
and then to make a short story long and
i'll i'll shut up lex but

832
00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:28,639
i'll i'll shut up lex but
 

833
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,509
i'll i'll shut up lex but
what what grabbed me about becker and

834
00:15:31,509 --> 00:15:31,519
what what grabbed me about becker and
 

835
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:32,710
what what grabbed me about becker and
this is in part

836
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:32,720
this is in part
 

837
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,949
this is in part
uh because i read a lot of his other

838
00:15:34,949 --> 00:15:34,959
uh because i read a lot of his other
 

839
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:36,150
uh because i read a lot of his other
books um

840
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:36,160
books um
 

841
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,910
books um
there's another book the birth and death

842
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:37,920
there's another book the birth and death
 

843
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,990
there's another book the birth and death
of meaning uh which is

844
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:40,000
of meaning uh which is
 

845
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,189
of meaning uh which is
framed um in from an evolutionary

846
00:15:43,189 --> 00:15:43,199
framed um in from an evolutionary
 

847
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:44,069

849
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,550
perspective
and and then the denial of death is

850
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:46,560
and and then the denial of death is
 

851
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,509
and and then the denial of death is
really more

852
00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:47,519
really more
 

853
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,870

00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:01,430

a very potent juxtaposition

886
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:36,639
compatible and can you comment on what's
 

887
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,550

what a psychodynamics view of the world
 

889
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,069

question
 

897
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,189
question
well for the evolutionary types um

898
00:16:47,189 --> 00:16:47,199
well for the evolutionary types um
 

899
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:51,189
well for the evolutionary types um
in general are interested

900
00:16:51,189 --> 00:16:51,199
in general are interested
 

901
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,710
in general are interested
in um how it is and

902
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:54,720
in um how it is and
 

903
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,550
in um how it is and
why it is that we

904
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:58,560
why it is that we
 

905
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,509
why it is that we
have adapted to our surroundings in the

906
00:17:01,509 --> 00:17:01,519
have adapted to our surroundings in the
 

907
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,749
have adapted to our surroundings in the
service of persisting over time

908
00:17:03,749 --> 00:17:03,759
service of persisting over time
 

909
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:06,789
service of persisting over time
and being represented in the gene pool

910
00:17:06,789 --> 00:17:06,799
and being represented in the gene pool
 

911
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,909
and being represented in the gene pool
thereafter you used to be a fish

912
00:17:09,909 --> 00:17:09,919
thereafter you used to be a fish
 

913
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,990
thereafter you used to be a fish
yes we used to be a fish and also yeah

914
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:12,000
yes we used to be a fish and also yeah
 

915
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,350
yes we used to be a fish and also yeah
and i ended up

916
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:13,360
and i ended up
 

917
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,429
and i ended up
uh talking on a podcast yeah how we came

918
00:17:15,429 --> 00:17:15,439
uh talking on a podcast yeah how we came
 

919
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,270
uh talking on a podcast yeah how we came
to be that way how we came to be that

920
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:17,280
to be that way how we came to be that
 

921
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,069
to be that way how we came to be that
way

922
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:18,079
way
 

923
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,710
way
and so whereas the existential

924
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:20,720
and so whereas the existential
 

925
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,069
and so whereas the existential
psychodynamic types

926
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:22,079
psychodynamic types
 

927
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,669
psychodynamic types
i would say are more interested in

928
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:23,679
i would say are more interested in
 

929
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,429
i would say are more interested in
development across

930
00:17:25,429 --> 00:17:25,439
development across
 

931
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,630
development across
a single lifespan and

932
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:28,640
a single lifespan and
 

933
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,990
a single lifespan and
but but the evolutionary types dismiss

934
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:32,000
but but the evolutionary types dismiss
 

935
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,390
but but the evolutionary types dismiss
the psychodynamic types as overly

936
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:34,400
the psychodynamic types as overly
 

937
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,510
the psychodynamic types as overly

their views
 

943
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,630
their views
well they um you know they'll just say

944
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:42,640
well they um you know they'll just say
 

945
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,630
well they um you know they'll just say
these guys are talking [\h__\h] if you'll

these guys are talking [\h__\h] if you'll
 

947
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,990
these guys are talking [\h__\h] if you'll
pardon the expression

948
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:46,000
pardon the expression
 

949
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,909
pardon the expression
and of course uh you can turn right

950
00:17:47,909 --> 00:17:47,919
and of course uh you can turn right
 

951
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,350
and of course uh you can turn right
around and

around and
 

953
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,669

say the same about the evolutionary

00:17:51,669 --> 00:17:51,679
say the same about the evolutionary

um intrinsic antithesis

970
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:19,280
um intrinsic antithesis
 

971
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,430
um intrinsic antithesis
between these viewpoints i just found

972
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:21,440
between these viewpoints i just found
 

973
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,110
between these viewpoints i just found
them dialectically

so one question i would ask here is um

980
00:18:31,029 --> 00:18:31,039
so one question i would ask here is um
 

981
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,669
so one question i would ask here is um
about a science being speculative you

982
00:18:33,669 --> 00:18:33,679
about a science being speculative you
 

983
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,110
about a science being speculative you
know we understand so a little about the

know we understand so a little about the
 

985
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,150
know we understand so a little about the

989
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,070
you said you picked up becker's book and
you know it felt like it was onto

00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,549
you know it felt like it was onto
something that's the same thing i felt

992
00:18:42,549 --> 00:18:42,559
something that's the same thing i felt
 

993
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,110
something that's the same thing i felt
when i picked up becker's book uh

994
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:45,120
when i picked up becker's book uh
 

995
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:45,990
when i picked up becker's book uh
probably also

996
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:46,000
probably also
 

997
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,710
probably also
in my early 20s uh you know i read a lot

998
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:48,720
in my early 20s uh you know i read a lot
 

999
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,470
in my early 20s uh you know i read a lot
of philosophy but it felt like

1000
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:50,480
of philosophy but it felt like
 

1001
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,070
of philosophy but it felt like
the question of the meaning of life kind

1002
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:52,080
the question of the meaning of life kind
 

1003
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,830
the question of the meaning of life kind
of

1004
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:53,840
of
 

1005
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,029
of
you know this seemed to be the most uh

1006
00:18:57,029 --> 00:18:57,039
you know this seemed to be the most uh
 

1007
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,430
you know this seemed to be the most uh
the closest to the truth somehow

1008
00:18:59,430 --> 00:18:59,440
the closest to the truth somehow
 

1009
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,350
the closest to the truth somehow
it was on to something so i i guess the

1010
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:01,360
it was on to something so i i guess the
 

1011
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:05,350
it was on to something so i i guess the
question that i want to ask also is like

1012
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:05,360

 

1013
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,990

how speculative is psychology how like

1014
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:08,000
how speculative is psychology how like
 

1015
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,430
how speculative is psychology how like
all of your lives work

1016
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:11,440
all of your lives work
 

1017
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,549
all of your lives work
um how do you feel how confident do you

um how do you feel how confident do you
feel about the whole thing

1020
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:16,240
feel about the whole thing
 

1021
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,230
feel about the whole thing
about understanding our mind i feel

1022
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:20,240
about understanding our mind i feel
 

1023
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,390
about understanding our mind i feel
confidently unconfident to have it

1024
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:24,400
confidently unconfident to have it
 

1025
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,630
confidently unconfident to have it
both ways like what do we make of

1026
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:26,640
both ways like what do we make of
 

1027
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,150
both ways like what do we make of
psychology you want to make starting

1028
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:28,160
psychology you want to make starting
 

1029
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,270
psychology you want to make starting
with freud's

1030
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:29,280
with freud's
 

1031
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,470
with freud's
you know starting um just just our

1032
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:32,480
you know starting um just just our
 

1033
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,590
you know starting um just just our
or even just philosophy uh even

or even just philosophy uh even
 

1035
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,430
or even just philosophy uh even
uh the aspects of uh the sciences

1036
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:39,440
uh the aspects of uh the sciences
 

1037
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,669
uh the aspects of uh the sciences
like uh you know my field of artificial

1038
00:19:41,669 --> 00:19:41,679
like uh you know my field of artificial
 

1039
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,230
like uh you know my field of artificial
intelligence but also physics

1040
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:44,240
intelligence but also physics
 

1041
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,430
intelligence but also physics
you know it often feels like man we

1042
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:47,440
you know it often feels like man we
 

1043
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,630
you know it often feels like man we
don't really understand

1044
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:48,640
don't really understand
 

1045
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,789
don't really understand
most of what's going on here and

1046
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:50,799
most of what's going on here and
 

1047
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:51,990
most of what's going on here and
certainly that's true

1048
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:52,000
certainly that's true
 

1049
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,950
certainly that's true
with uh the human mind yeah well to me

1050
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:54,960
with uh the human mind yeah well to me
 

1051
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,830
with uh the human mind yeah well to me
that's the proper epistemological stance

1052
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:57,840
that's the proper epistemological stance
 

1053
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,630
that's the proper epistemological stance
i don't know anything well uh it's the

1054
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:00,640
i don't know anything well uh it's the
 

1055
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,590
i don't know anything well uh it's the
socratic

1056
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:01,600
socratic
 

1057
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,950
socratic
uh i know that i don't know which is the

1058
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:04,960
uh i know that i don't know which is the
 

1059
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,990
uh i know that i don't know which is the
first step

1060
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:06,000
first step
 

1061
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,310
first step
on the path to wisdom i i would argue

1062
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:10,320
on the path to wisdom i i would argue
 

1063
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:15,270
on the path to wisdom i i would argue
forcefully that we know a lot more

1064
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:15,280
forcefully that we know a lot more
 

1065
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,870
forcefully that we know a lot more
than we used to i would argue

1066
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:18,880
than we used to i would argue
 

1067
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,669
than we used to i would argue
equally forcefully uh not that i have a

1068
00:20:21,669 --> 00:20:21,679
equally forcefully uh not that i have a
 

1069
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,789
equally forcefully uh not that i have a
phd in the philosophy of science but i i

1070
00:20:24,789 --> 00:20:24,799
phd in the philosophy of science but i i
 

1071
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:25,990
phd in the philosophy of science but i i
believe that the

1072
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:26,000
believe that the
 

1073
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,110
believe that the
thomas coons of the world are right

1074
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:29,120
thomas coons of the world are right
 

1075
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,230
thomas coons of the world are right
when they point out that change is not

1076
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:32,240
when they point out that change is not
 

1077
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,750
when they point out that change is not
necessarily progress and

1078
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:35,760
necessarily progress and
 

1079
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,350
necessarily progress and
so on the one hand i i do think we know

1080
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:39,360
so on the one hand i i do think we know
 

1081
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,310
so on the one hand i i do think we know
a lot more

1082
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:40,320
a lot more
 

1083
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,390
a lot more
than we did back in the day when if you

1084
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:42,400
than we did back in the day when if you
 

1085
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,789
than we did back in the day when if you
wanted to fly you put on some wax wings

1086
00:20:44,789 --> 00:20:44,799
wanted to fly you put on some wax wings
 

1087
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:45,190
wanted to fly you put on some wax wings
and

1088
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:45,200
and
 

1089
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,669
and
jumped off a mountain yeah on the other

1090
00:20:47,669 --> 00:20:47,679
jumped off a mountain yeah on the other
 

1091
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:48,549
jumped off a mountain yeah on the other
hand

1092
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:48,559
hand
 

1093
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,789
hand
i think it's quite arrogant when

1094
00:20:51,789 --> 00:20:51,799
i think it's quite arrogant when
 

1095
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:55,190
i think it's quite arrogant when
scientists i'll just speak about

1096
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:55,200
scientists i'll just speak about
 

1097
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,029
scientists i'll just speak about
psychological scientists um when

1098
00:20:59,029 --> 00:20:59,039
psychological scientists um when
 

1099
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:02,630
psychological scientists um when
they have the audacity to mistake

1100
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:02,640
they have the audacity to mistake
 

1101
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,310
they have the audacity to mistake
statistical precision for

statistical precision for
 

1103
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,350
statistical precision for
knowledge and insight

1104
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:09,360
knowledge and insight
 

1105
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,710
knowledge and insight
and when they make the mistake in my

1106
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:12,720
and when they make the mistake in my
 

1107
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,470
and when they make the mistake in my
estimation

1108
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:14,480
estimation
 

1109
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,029
estimation
that einstein bemoaned and that's this

1110
00:21:17,029 --> 00:21:17,039
that einstein bemoaned and that's this
 

1111
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:17,669
that einstein bemoaned and that's this
idea

1112
00:21:17,669 --> 00:21:17,679
idea
 

1113
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,350
idea
that the mere accumulation of data

1114
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:21,360
that the mere accumulation of data
 

1115
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,390
that the mere accumulation of data
uh will necessarily result in

1116
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:24,400
uh will necessarily result in
 

1117
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,750
uh will necessarily result in
conceptual breakthroughs and so i i like

1118
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:27,760
conceptual breakthroughs and so i i like
 

1119
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,390
conceptual breakthroughs and so i i like
the um well we're all i hope

1120
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:30,400
the um well we're all i hope
 

1121

00:22:04,149 --> 00:22:04,159
uh which is it and of course the point
 

1153
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:08,310
uh which is it and of course the point
is that it's both our theories

1154
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:08,320
is that it's both our theories
 

1155
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,430
is that it's both our theories
are i believe powerful ways to direct

1156
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:11,440
are i believe powerful ways to direct
 

1157
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,190
are i believe powerful ways to direct
our attention

1158
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:13,200
our attention
 

1159
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,350
our attention
to aspects of human affairs

00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:17,360
to aspects of human affairs
 

1161
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,950
to aspects of human affairs
that might render us

1162
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:20,960
that might render us
 

1163
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,710
that might render us
better able to understand ourselves in

an experimental psychologist i adhere to
 

1171
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:32,310
an experimental psychologist i adhere to
the view

1172
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:32,320
the view
 

1173
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,070
the view
that theories are essentially hypothesis

1174
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:36,080
that theories are essentially hypothesis
 

1175
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,990
that theories are essentially hypothesis
generating devices and that at its best

1176
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:40,000
generating devices and that at its best
 

1177
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,230

00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:42,240
science is a dialectical interplay where
 

1179
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,149
science is a dialectical interplay where
you have theoretical assertions

1180
00:22:44,149 --> 00:22:44,159
you have theoretical assertions
 

1181
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:47,510
you have theoretical assertions
that yield testable hypotheses

1182
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:47,520
that yield testable hypotheses
 

1183
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,390
that yield testable hypotheses
and that either results in the

1184
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:50,400
and that either results in the
 

1185
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,149
and that either results in the
corroboration of the theory

1186
00:22:52,149 --> 00:22:52,159
corroboration of the theory
 

1187
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:56,390
corroboration of the theory
the rejection of it or the modification

1188
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:56,400
the rejection of it or the modification
 

1189
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,669
the rejection of it or the modification
thereafter if we look at the

1190
00:22:58,669 --> 00:22:58,679
thereafter if we look at the
 

1191
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:01,350
thereafter if we look at the
existentialists

1192
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:01,360
existentialists
 

1193
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,789
existentialists
or even like uh modern philosopher

he would be jumping in and i believe
 

1207
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,909
he would be jumping in and i believe
very interesting and important ways but

1208
00:23:21,909 --> 00:23:21,919
very interesting and important ways but
 

1209
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:24,310
very interesting and important ways but

he was uh basically saying our work
 

1213
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:30,390
he was uh basically saying our work
is nonsense let's get into this i'm sure

um
jordan was working on his maps of

1226
00:23:40,149 --> 00:23:40,159
jordan was working on his maps of
 

1227
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:41,269
jordan was working on his maps of
meaning

1228
00:23:41,269 --> 00:23:41,279
meaning
 

1229
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:45,269
meaning
and we were publishing our work

1230
00:23:45,269 --> 00:23:45,279
and we were publishing our work
 

1231
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:48,830
and we were publishing our work
and i i think jordan at the time

1232
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:48,840
and i i think jordan at the time
 

1233
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:52,230
and i i think jordan at the time
um was concerned about

1234
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:52,240
um was concerned about
 

1235
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,669
um was concerned about
our vague claims to the effect that

1236
00:23:55,669 --> 00:23:55,679
our vague claims to the effect that
 

1237
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:59,430
our vague claims to the effect that
all meaning is arbitrary

1238
00:23:59,430 --> 00:23:59,440
all meaning is arbitrary
 

1239
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,549
all meaning is arbitrary
he takes a more jungian

1240
00:24:02,549 --> 00:24:02,559
he takes a more jungian
 

1241
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,549
he takes a more jungian
as well as evolutionary view that i

1242
00:24:04,549 --> 00:24:04,559
as well as evolutionary view that i
 

1243
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,710
as well as evolutionary view that i
don't think is wrong by the way

1244
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:06,720
don't think is wrong by the way
 

1245
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,230
don't think is wrong by the way
which is that um there are certain

1246
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:10,240
which is that um there are certain
 

1247
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,750
which is that um there are certain
kinds of meanings

1248
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:13,760
kinds of meanings
 

1249
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,950
kinds of meanings
that are more important let's say

1250
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:16,960
that are more important let's say
 

1251
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,190
that are more important let's say
religious types and that we didn't pay

1252
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:21,200
religious types and that we didn't pay
 

1253
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,310
religious types and that we didn't pay
sufficient attention to that um

1254
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:24,320
sufficient attention to that um
 

1255
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,590
sufficient attention to that um
in our early days so uh can you try to

1256
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:27,600
in our early days so uh can you try to
 

1257
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,990
in our early days so uh can you try to
uh lose a day like what his world view

1258
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:30,000
uh lose a day like what his world view
 

1259
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,149
uh lose a day like what his world view
is because he's also a religious man

1260
00:24:32,149 --> 00:24:32,159
is because he's also a religious man
 

1261
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,269
is because he's also a religious man
uh so what uh what was this what was uh

1262
00:24:35,269 --> 00:24:35,279
uh so what uh what was this what was uh
 

1263
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:36,710
uh so what uh what was this what was uh
some of the interesting aspects of the

1264
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:36,720
some of the interesting aspects of the
 

1265
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,669
some of the interesting aspects of the
disagreements

1266
00:24:37,669 --> 00:24:37,679
disagreements
 

1267
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,669
disagreements
that then yeah well back in the day i

1976
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:28,560
uh when they started with the assumption
 

1977
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,550
uh when they started with the assumption
that we were

1978
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:29,560
that we were
 

1979
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,990
that we were

margaret thatcher

1990
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:39,680
margaret thatcher
 

1991
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,750
margaret thatcher
you're too young uh you know in the

1992
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:41,760
you're too young uh you know in the
 

1993
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,230
you're too young uh you know in the
1980s she said societies

1994
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:44,240
1980s she said societies
 

1995
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,310
1980s she said societies
there's no such thing as societies

1996
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:46,320
there's no such thing as societies
 

1997
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,630
there's no such thing as societies
there's just

1998
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:47,640
there's just
 

1999
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:51,990

individuals pursuing their self-interest
 

2001
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,109
individuals pursuing their self-interest
so uh so that's one point where i would

2002
00:38:55,109 --> 00:38:55,119
so uh so that's one point where i would
 

2003
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:57,349
so uh so that's one point where i would
take issue respectfully with john locke

2004
00:38:57,349 --> 00:38:57,359
take issue respectfully with john locke
 

2005
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:58,870
take issue respectfully with john locke
point number two

2006
00:38:58,870 --> 00:38:58,880
point number two
 

2007
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,069
point number two
is when locke says in 1690 well

2008
00:39:02,069 --> 00:39:02,079
is when locke says in 1690 well
 

2009
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:05,430
is when locke says in 1690 well
england's filled up um

2010
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:05,440
england's filled up um
 

2011
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,829
england's filled up um
so if you want some land just go to

2012
00:39:07,829 --> 00:39:07,839
so if you want some land just go to
 

2013
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:09,430
so if you want some land just go to
america it's empty

2014
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:09,440
america it's empty
 

2015
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,510
america it's empty
or maybe there's a few savages there

2016
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:11,520
or maybe there's a few savages there
 

2017
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,190
or maybe there's a few savages there
just kill them

2018
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:13,200
just kill them
 

2019
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,069
just kill them
so and and melville does the same thing

2020
00:39:16,069 --> 00:39:16,079
so and and melville does the same thing
 

2021
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:17,829
so and and melville does the same thing
in moby dick where he

2022
00:39:17,829 --> 00:39:17,839
in moby dick where he
 

2023
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:20,550
in moby dick where he
he thinks about will there ever come a

2024
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:20,560
he thinks about will there ever come a
 

2025
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,670
he thinks about will there ever come a
time where we run out of whales

2026
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:23,680
time where we run out of whales
 

2027
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,310
time where we run out of whales
and he says no but we have run out of

2028
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:26,320
and he says no but we have run out of
 

2029
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,270
and he says no but we have run out of
whales

2030
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:27,280
whales
 

2031
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,470
whales
and so locke was right maybe

2032
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:30,480
and so locke was right maybe
 

2033
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:34,310
and so locke was right maybe
in 1690 that the world was large

2034
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:34,320
in 1690 that the world was large
 

2035
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,510
in 1690 that the world was large
and had infinite resources he's

2036
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:37,520
and had infinite resources he's
 

2037
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,870
and had infinite resources he's
certainly

2038
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:38,880
certainly
 

2039
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,710
certainly
wronged today in in my opinion

2040
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:42,720
wronged today in in my opinion
 

2041
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,990
wronged today in in my opinion
also wrong is the claim uh

2042
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:46,000
also wrong is the claim uh
 

2043
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,430
also wrong is the claim uh
that the unlimited pursuit of personal

2044
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:49,440
that the unlimited pursuit of personal
 

2045
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,910
that the unlimited pursuit of personal
wealth does not harm those around us

2046
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:51,920
wealth does not harm those around us
 

2047
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,670
wealth does not harm those around us
there is no doubt

2048
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:53,680
there is no doubt
 

2049
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:57,230
there is no doubt
uh that radical inequality is tragic

2050
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:57,240
uh that radical inequality is tragic
 

2051
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:00,470
uh that radical inequality is tragic
psychologically and physically it's

2052
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:00,480
psychologically and physically it's
 

2053
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,430
psychologically and physically it's
poverty is not that terrible it's easy

2054
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:03,440
poverty is not that terrible it's easy
 

2055
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,109
poverty is not that terrible it's easy
for me to say because i have a place to

2056
00:40:05,109 --> 00:40:05,119
for me to say because i have a place to
 

2057
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:07,190
for me to say because i have a place to
stay and something to eat

stay and something to eat
 

2059
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,230
stay and something to eat
but as long as you're not starving and

2060
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:10,240
but as long as you're not starving and
 

2061
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,430
but as long as you're not starving and
have a place to be poverty's not as

2062
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:13,440
have a place to be poverty's not as
 

2063
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,470
have a place to be poverty's not as
challenging as being having the

2064
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:16,480
challenging as being having the
 

2065
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,069
challenging as being having the
impoverished and close

2066
00:40:18,069 --> 00:40:18,079
impoverished and close
 

2067
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:20,950
impoverished and close
proximity to those who are obscenely

2068
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:20,960
proximity to those who are obscenely
 

2069

wealthy
so it's not the any absolute measure of

2072
00:40:24,309 --> 00:40:24,319
so it's not the any absolute measure of
 

2073
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:26,630
so it's not the any absolute measure of
your well-being it's the inequality of

2074
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:26,640
your well-being it's the inequality of
 

2075
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:27,510
your well-being it's the inequality of
that well-being

2076
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:27,520
that well-being
 

2077
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,870
that well-being
is quite frantically painful um so maybe

2078
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:30,880
is quite frantically painful um so maybe
 

2079
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,670
is quite frantically painful um so maybe
just to uh link on the jordan peterson

2080
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:33,680
just to uh link on the jordan peterson
 

2081
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,390
just to uh link on the jordan peterson
thing

2082
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:34,400
thing
 

2083
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,030
thing
in terms of your uh disagreement on his

2084
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:37,040
in terms of your uh disagreement on his
 

2085
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,230
in terms of your uh disagreement on his
worldview so he went

2086
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:38,240
worldview so he went
 

2087
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,390
worldview so he went
through quite a bit it you know there's

2088
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:40,400
through quite a bit it you know there's
 

2089
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,109
through quite a bit it you know there's
been quite a bit of fire right in

2090
00:40:43,109 --> 00:40:43,119
been quite a bit of fire right in
 

2091
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:47,349
been quite a bit of fire right in
in his defense or maybe his opposition

2092
00:40:47,349 --> 00:40:47,359
in his defense or maybe his opposition
 

2093
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:50,309
in his defense or maybe his opposition
of the idea of equality of outcomes

2094
00:40:50,309 --> 00:40:50,319
of the idea of equality of outcomes
 

2095
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:52,710
of the idea of equality of outcomes
so looking at the inequality that's in

2096
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:52,720
so looking at the inequality that's in
 

2097
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,430
so looking at the inequality that's in
our world

2098
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:53,440
our world
 

2099
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:57,510
our world
looking at you know certain groups

2100
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:57,520
looking at you know certain groups
 

2101
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,750
looking at you know certain groups
measurably having an outcome that's

2102
00:40:59,750 --> 00:40:59,760
measurably having an outcome that's
 

2103
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,750
measurably having an outcome that's
different than other groups

2104
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:01,760
different than other groups
 

2105
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,750
different than other groups
and then drawing conclusions about

fundamental
 

2109
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:08,790
fundamental
uh unfairness injustice inequality in

00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:08,800
uh unfairness injustice inequality in
 

2111
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,309
uh unfairness injustice inequality in
the system so like

2112
00:41:10,309 --> 00:41:10,319
the system so like
 

2113
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:13,349

inequality
 

2119
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,910
inequality
and he's been kind of uh saying pretty

2120
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:19,920
and he's been kind of uh saying pretty
 

2121
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,510
and he's been kind of uh saying pretty
simple things

2122
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:21,520
simple things
 

2123
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,390
simple things
uh to say that uh you know the system

2124
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:24,400
uh to say that uh you know the system
 

2125
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,430
uh to say that uh you know the system
for the most part

2126
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:25,440
for the most part
 

2127
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,870
for the most part
is not broken or flawed yeah

2615
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:18,390
but we are also simultaneously
uber social creatures who are

2616
00:51:18,390 --> 00:51:18,400
uber social creatures who are
 

2617
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:21,270
uber social creatures who are
eager to reciprocate and in fact we're

2618
00:51:21,270 --> 00:51:21,280
eager to reciprocate and in fact we're
 

2619
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,309
eager to reciprocate and in fact we're
congenitally prepared to be

2620
00:51:23,309 --> 00:51:23,319
congenitally prepared to be
 

2621
00:51:23,319 --> 00:51:25,670
congenitally prepared to be
reciprocators to the point where

2622
00:51:25,670 --> 00:51:25,680
reciprocators to the point where
 

2623
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:28,390
reciprocators to the point where
uh we will reciprocate on the basis of

2624
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:28,400
uh we will reciprocate on the basis of
 

2625
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:29,670
uh we will reciprocate on the basis of
intentions

2626
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:29,680
intentions
 

2627
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,910
intentions
above and beyond what actually happened

2628
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:31,920
above and beyond what actually happened
 

2629
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:32,790
above and beyond what actually happened
how so

2630
00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:32,800
how so
 

2631
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:37,589
how so
i mean your work is on the fundamental

2632
00:51:37,589 --> 00:51:37,599
i mean your work is on the fundamental
 

2633
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:40,710
i mean your work is on the fundamental
role of the fear of mortality yeah

2634
00:51:40,710 --> 00:51:40,720
role of the fear of mortality yeah
 

2635
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:43,670
role of the fear of mortality yeah
in ourselves how fundamental is this

2636
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:43,680
in ourselves how fundamental is this
 

2637
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:46,150
in ourselves how fundamental is this
reciprocation this human connection to

2638
00:51:46,150 --> 00:51:46,160
reciprocation this human connection to
 

2639
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:46,549
reciprocation this human connection to
other

2640
00:51:46,549 --> 00:51:46,559
other
 

2641
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:49,109
other
humans well i think it's really innate

2642
00:51:49,109 --> 00:51:49,119
humans well i think it's really innate
 

2643
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:50,309
humans well i think it's really innate
yeah i think it's because

2644
00:51:50,309 --> 00:51:50,319
yeah i think it's because
 

2645
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:52,950
yeah i think it's because
yeah bats reciprocate uh not by

2646
00:51:52,950 --> 00:51:52,960
yeah bats reciprocate uh not by
 

2647
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:54,230
yeah bats reciprocate uh not by
intention but

2648
00:51:54,230 --> 00:51:54,240
intention but
 

2649
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:56,390
intention but
uh you know this i'm going here from

2650
00:51:56,390 --> 00:51:56,400
uh you know this i'm going here from
 

2651
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:57,589
uh you know this i'm going here from
richard dawkins

2652
00:51:57,589 --> 00:51:57,599
richard dawkins
 

2653
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:00,870
richard dawkins
uh the selfish gene you know to

2654
00:52:00,870 --> 00:52:00,880
uh the selfish gene you know to
 

2655
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,950
uh the selfish gene you know to
i love the early dawkins i'm less

2656
00:52:02,950 --> 00:52:02,960
i love the early dawkins i'm less
 

2657
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,470
i love the early dawkins i'm less
enamored

2658
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:04,480
enamored
 

2659
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:07,670
enamored
like the early beat yeah no no again i

2660
00:52:07,670 --> 00:52:07,680
like the early beat yeah no no again i
 

2661
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:08,470
like the early beat yeah no no again i
say this

2662
00:52:08,470 --> 00:52:08,480
say this
 

2663
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:11,510
say this
with great respect but uh you know

2664
00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:11,520
with great respect but uh you know
 

2665
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:12,230
with great respect but uh you know
dawkins

2666
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:12,240
dawkins
 

2667
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,950
dawkins
just points out that uh you know

2668
00:52:14,950 --> 00:52:14,960
just points out that uh you know
 

2669
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:16,309
just points out that uh you know
reciprocation is

2670
00:52:16,309 --> 00:52:16,319
reciprocation is
 

2671
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:19,829
reciprocation is
just fundamental cooperation is

2672
00:52:19,829 --> 00:52:19,839
just fundamental cooperation is
 

2673
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:22,950
just fundamental cooperation is
fundamental you know it is the it's a

2674
00:52:22,950 --> 00:52:22,960
fundamental you know it is the it's a
 

2675
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,230
fundamental you know it is the it's a
one-sided view

2676
00:52:24,230 --> 00:52:24,240
one-sided view
 

2677
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:28,549
one-sided view
of evolutionary takes on thanks when we

2678
00:52:28,549 --> 00:52:28,559
of evolutionary takes on thanks when we
 

2679
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:30,829
of evolutionary takes on thanks when we
see it solely in terms of individual

2680
00:52:30,829 --> 00:52:30,839
see it solely in terms of individual
 

2681
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:32,390
see it solely in terms of individual
competition

2682
00:52:32,390 --> 00:52:32,400
competition
 

2683
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,470
competition
it's it's almost from a game theoretic

2684
00:52:34,470 --> 00:52:34,480
it's it's almost from a game theoretic
 

2685
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,309
it's it's almost from a game theoretic
perspective too it's just easier to see

2686
00:52:36,309 --> 00:52:36,319
perspective too it's just easier to see
 

2687
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:37,270
perspective too it's just easier to see
the world that way

2688
00:52:37,270 --> 00:52:37,280
the world that way
 

2689
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:40,069
the world that way
it's it's easier to i don't know i i

2690
00:52:40,069 --> 00:52:40,079
it's it's easier to i don't know i i
 

2691
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:42,710
it's it's easier to i don't know i i
mean you see this in physics uh

2692
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:42,720
mean you see this in physics uh
 

2693
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,390
mean you see this in physics uh
there's a whole field of folks like

2694
00:52:44,390 --> 00:52:44,400
there's a whole field of folks like
 

2695
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,150
there's a whole field of folks like
complexity yeah

2696
00:52:46,150 --> 00:52:46,160
complexity yeah
 

2697
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,309
complexity yeah
that kind of embrace the fact that it's

2698
00:52:48,309 --> 00:52:48,319
that kind of embrace the fact that it's
 

2699
00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:50,390
that kind of embrace the fact that it's
all an intricately connected mess

2700
00:52:50,390 --> 00:52:50,400
all an intricately connected mess
 

2701
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,150
all an intricately connected mess
and it's just very difficult to do

2702
00:52:52,150 --> 00:52:52,160
and it's just very difficult to do
 

2703
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:54,790
and it's just very difficult to do
anything uh with that kind of science

2704
00:52:54,790 --> 00:52:54,800
anything uh with that kind of science
 

2705
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,630
anything uh with that kind of science
but it seems to be much closer to

2706
00:52:56,630 --> 00:52:56,640
but it seems to be much closer to
 

2707
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,230
but it seems to be much closer to
actually representing what the world is

2708
00:52:58,230 --> 00:52:58,240
actually representing what the world is
 

2709
00:52:58,240 --> 00:52:58,870
actually representing what the world is
like

2710
00:52:58,870 --> 00:52:58,880
like
 

2711
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:01,589
like
so like you put it earlier lex it's

2712
00:53:01,589 --> 00:53:01,599
so like you put it earlier lex it's
 

2713
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:02,470
so like you put it earlier lex it's
messy

2714
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:02,480
messy
 

2715
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,790
messy
so yeah left and right you mentioned

2716
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:04,800
so yeah left and right you mentioned
 

2717
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:05,990
so yeah left and right you mentioned
you're thinking of maybe actually

2718
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:06,000
you're thinking of maybe actually
 

2719
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:06,390
you're thinking of maybe actually
putting

2720
00:53:06,390 --> 00:53:06,400
putting
 

2721
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:07,750
putting
it down on paper or something yeah i

2722
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:07,760
it down on paper or something yeah i
 

2723
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,990
it down on paper or something yeah i
would like to because what i would

2724
00:53:09,990 --> 00:53:10,000
would like to because what i would
 

2725
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,109
would like to because what i would
what i would like to point out again in

2726
00:53:13,109 --> 00:53:13,119
what i would like to point out again in
 

2727
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:15,510
what i would like to point out again in
admiration of all the people that i will

2728
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:15,520
admiration of all the people that i will
 

2729
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:15,910
admiration of all the people that i will
then

2730
00:53:15,910 --> 00:53:15,920
then
 

2731
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:18,309
then
try and have the gall to criticize this

2732
00:53:18,309 --> 00:53:18,319
try and have the gall to criticize this
 

2733
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:20,390
try and have the gall to criticize this
look these are all geniuses

2734
00:53:20,390 --> 00:53:20,400
look these are all geniuses
 

2735
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:24,230
look these are all geniuses
um lock genius adam smith

2736
00:53:24,230 --> 00:53:24,240
um lock genius adam smith
 

2737
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:27,510
um lock genius adam smith
genius when he uses the notion that

2738
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:27,520
genius when he uses the notion that
 

2739
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:28,710
genius when he uses the notion that
we're bartering

2740
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:28,720
we're bartering
 

2741
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:31,430
we're bartering
creatures so he uses that reciprocation

2742
00:53:31,430 --> 00:53:31,440
creatures so he uses that reciprocation
 

2743
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:32,470
creatures so he uses that reciprocation
idea

2744
00:53:32,470 --> 00:53:32,480
idea
 

2745
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:34,710
idea
as the basis of his way of thinking

2746
00:53:34,710 --> 00:53:34,720
as the basis of his way of thinking
 

2747
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,790
as the basis of his way of thinking
about things but that's not at the core

2748
00:53:36,790 --> 00:53:36,800
about things but that's not at the core
 

2749
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,309
about things but that's not at the core
the murdering is not at the core of

2750
00:53:38,309 --> 00:53:38,319
the murdering is not at the core of
 

2751
00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:39,910
the murdering is not at the core of
human nature it's not a well

2752
00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:39,920
human nature it's not a well
 

2753
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:41,670
human nature it's not a well
he says it is he says we're

2754
00:53:41,670 --> 00:53:41,680
he says it is he says we're
 

2755
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,829
he says it is he says we're
fundamentally bartering creatures

2756
00:53:43,829 --> 00:53:43,839
fundamentally bartering creatures
 

2757
00:53:43,839 --> 00:53:45,510
fundamentally bartering creatures
well that doesn't even make sense then

2758
00:53:45,510 --> 00:53:45,520
well that doesn't even make sense then
 

2759
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:46,870
well that doesn't even make sense then
because then what how

2760
00:53:46,870 --> 00:53:46,880
because then what how
 

2761
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,270
because then what how
how can we then be autonomous

2762
00:53:49,270 --> 00:53:49,280
how can we then be autonomous
 

2763
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:50,069
how can we then be autonomous
individuals

2764
00:53:50,069 --> 00:53:50,079
individuals
 

2765
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:51,750
individuals
well because we're going to barter with

2766
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:51,760
well because we're going to barter with
 

2767
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:54,150
well because we're going to barter with
an eye on on on for self

2768
00:53:54,150 --> 00:53:54,160
an eye on on on for self
 

2769
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:57,589
an eye on on on for self
for ourselves self yeah but all right so

2770
00:53:57,589 --> 00:53:57,599
for ourselves self yeah but all right so
 

2771
00:53:57,599 --> 00:53:59,750
for ourselves self yeah but all right so
but back to adam smith for a second lex

2772
00:53:59,750 --> 00:53:59,760
but back to adam smith for a second lex
 

2773
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:02,150
but back to adam smith for a second lex
is like adam smith here's he's got the

2774
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:02,160
is like adam smith here's he's got the
 

2775
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:03,589
is like adam smith here's he's got the
invisible hand

2776
00:54:03,589 --> 00:54:03,599

tend to cooperate and
 

2841
00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:34,870
tend to cooperate and
we also can be heroically

helpful to folks
 

2845
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:41,750
helpful to folks
in our own tribe and

2846
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:41,760
in our own tribe and
 

2847
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:45,270
in our own tribe and
of course how you define one's tribe

of course how you define one's tribe
 

2849
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:48,069
of course how you define one's tribe
becomes critically important but what

2850
00:55:48,069 --> 00:55:48,079
becomes critically important but what
 

2851
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:49,109
becomes critically important but what
some people say

2852
00:55:49,109 --> 00:55:49,119
some people say
 

2853
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:53,190
some people say
is look we let what would then be

2854
00:55:53,190 --> 00:55:53,200
is look we let what would then be
 

2855
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,829
is look we let what would then be
what kind of political institutions and

2856
00:55:55,829 --> 00:55:55,839
what kind of political institutions and
 

2857

what kind of political institutions and
what kind of economic organization

what kind of economic organization
 

2859
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:02,549
what kind of economic organization
can we think about to kind of hit that

2860
00:56:02,549 --> 00:56:02,559
can we think about to kind of hit that
 

2861
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:03,829
can we think about to kind of hit that
sweet spot

2862
00:56:03,829 --> 00:56:03,839
sweet spot
 

2863
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:07,270
sweet spot
and that that would be in my opinion uh

2864
00:56:07,270 --> 00:56:07,280
and that that would be in my opinion uh
 

2865
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:10,630
and that that would be in my opinion uh
how do we maximize individual autonomy

2866
00:56:10,630 --> 00:56:10,640
how do we maximize individual autonomy
 

2867
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:13,870
how do we maximize individual autonomy
in a way that fosters uh

2868
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:13,880
in a way that fosters uh
 

2869

in a way that fosters uh
creativity and innovation and the

creativity and innovation and the
 

2871
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,710
creativity and innovation and the
self-regard that comes from

00:56:18,710 --> 00:56:18,720
self-regard that comes from
 

2873
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:22,390
self-regard that comes from
creative expression while

creative expression while
 

2875
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:25,510
creative expression while
engaging our more cooperative

2876
00:56:25,510 --> 00:56:25,520
engaging our more cooperative

00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:29,109
engaging our more cooperative
and reciprocal tendencies

2878
00:56:29,109 --> 00:56:29,119
and reciprocal tendencies
 

2879
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:32,789
and reciprocal tendencies
in order to come up with a system that

2880
00:56:32,789 --> 00:56:32,799
in order to come up with a system that
 

2881
00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:35,270
in order to come up with a system that
is potentially stable over time because

2882
00:56:35,270 --> 00:56:35,280
is potentially stable over time because
 

2883
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:36,710
is potentially stable over time because
the other thing about

2884
00:56:36,710 --> 00:56:36,720
the other thing about
 

2885
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:39,109
the other thing about
all capital-based systems is the

2886
00:56:39,109 --> 00:56:39,119
all capital-based systems is the
 

2887
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:39,750
all capital-based systems is the
stability

2888
00:56:39,750 --> 00:56:39,760
stability
 

2889
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:41,510
stability
is it fundamentally and unstable yeah

2890
00:56:41,510 --> 00:56:41,520
is it fundamentally and unstable yeah
 

2891
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:43,670
is it fundamentally and unstable yeah
because it's based on infinite growth

2892
00:56:43,670 --> 00:56:43,680
because it's based on infinite growth
 

2893
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,430
because it's based on infinite growth
and you know it's a positive feedback

2894
00:56:45,430 --> 00:56:45,440
and you know it's a positive feedback
 

2895
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:48,309
and you know it's a positive feedback
loop uh to be silly infinite growth is

2896
00:56:48,309 --> 00:56:48,319
loop uh to be silly infinite growth is
 

2897
00:56:48,319 --> 00:56:49,430
loop uh to be silly infinite growth is
only good for

2898
00:56:49,430 --> 00:56:49,440
only good for

otherwise uh you know we want to seek a

00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:55,839
otherwise uh you know we want to seek a
 

2905
00:56:55,839 --> 00:56:57,270
otherwise uh you know we want to seek a
steady state

2906

steady state
 

2907
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:00,230
steady state
and um that would be you know so when

2908
00:57:00,230 --> 00:57:00,240
and um that would be you know so when
 

2909
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:03,109
and um that would be you know so when

and and the the pentagon so we did a

3434
01:07:32,870 --> 01:07:32,880
and and the the pentagon so we did a
 

3435
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:34,630
and and the the pentagon so we did a
bunch of experiments and most of our

3436
01:07:34,630 --> 01:07:34,640
bunch of experiments and most of our
 

3437
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:36,710
bunch of experiments and most of our
experiments are disarmingly simple we

3438
01:07:36,710 --> 01:07:36,720
experiments are disarmingly simple we
 

3439
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:38,390
experiments are disarmingly simple we
have one group of people

3440
01:07:38,390 --> 01:07:38,400
have one group of people
 

3441
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:40,150
have one group of people
and we just remind them that they're

3442
01:07:40,150 --> 01:07:40,160
and we just remind them that they're
 

3443
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:42,390
and we just remind them that they're
going to die we say hey write

3444
01:07:42,390 --> 01:07:42,400
going to die we say hey write
 

3445
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:44,470
going to die we say hey write
your thoughts and feelings about dying

3446
01:07:44,470 --> 01:07:44,480
your thoughts and feelings about dying
 

3447
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:46,150
your thoughts and feelings about dying
or in other cases we stop

3448
01:07:46,150 --> 01:07:46,160
or in other cases we stop
 

3449
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:47,829
or in other cases we stop
them outside either in front of a

them outside either in front of a
 

3451
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:49,190
them outside either in front of a
funeral home

3452
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:49,200
funeral home
 

3453
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:52,069
funeral home
or a hundred meters to either side our

01:07:52,069 --> 01:07:52,079
or a hundred meters to either side our
 

3455
01:07:52,079 --> 01:07:53,910
or a hundred meters to either side our
thought being that if we stop you in

3456
01:07:53,910 --> 01:07:53,920
thought being that if we stop you in
 

3457
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:54,789
thought being that if we stop you in
front of a

3458
01:07:54,789 --> 01:07:54,799
front of a
 

3459
01:07:54,799 --> 01:07:56,950
front of a
funeral home then death is on your mind

3460
01:07:56,950 --> 01:07:56,960
funeral home then death is on your mind
 

3461
01:07:56,960 --> 01:07:58,549
funeral home then death is on your mind
even if you don't know it

3462
01:07:58,549 --> 01:07:58,559
even if you don't know it
 

3463
01:07:58,559 --> 01:07:59,990
even if you don't know it
and then there's other studies that are

3464
01:07:59,990 --> 01:08:00,000
and then there's other studies that are
 

3465
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,910
and then there's other studies that are
even more subtle where we bring people

3466
01:08:01,910 --> 01:08:01,920
even more subtle where we bring people
 

3467
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:03,270
even more subtle where we bring people
into the lab

3468
01:08:03,270 --> 01:08:03,280
into the lab
 

3469
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:06,549
into the lab
and they read stuff on a computer

3470
01:08:06,549 --> 01:08:06,559
and they read stuff on a computer
 

3471
01:08:06,559 --> 01:08:08,390
and they read stuff on a computer
and while they're doing that we flash

3472
01:08:08,390 --> 01:08:08,400
and while they're doing that we flash
 

3473
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:10,069
and while they're doing that we flash
the word death

3474
01:08:10,069 --> 01:08:10,079
the word death
 

3475
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:12,630
the word death
for 28 milliseconds it's so fast you

3476
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:12,640
for 28 milliseconds it's so fast you
 

3477
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:14,390
for 28 milliseconds it's so fast you
don't see anything

3478
01:08:14,390 --> 01:08:14,400
don't see anything
 

3479
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:16,390
don't see anything
and then we just measure people's

3480
01:08:16,390 --> 01:08:16,400
and then we just measure people's
 

3481
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:17,510
and then we just measure people's
reactions

3482
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:17,520
reactions
 

3483
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:20,870
reactions
or behavior thereafter so what we found

3484
01:08:20,870 --> 01:08:20,880
or behavior thereafter so what we found
 

3485
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:22,709
or behavior thereafter so what we found
in 2003

3486
01:08:22,709 --> 01:08:22,719
in 2003
 

3487
01:08:22,719 --> 01:08:26,470
in 2003
leading up to the election of 2004

3488
01:08:26,470 --> 01:08:26,480
leading up to the election of 2004
 

3489
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:29,269
leading up to the election of 2004
was that americans did not care for

3490
01:08:29,269 --> 01:08:29,279
was that americans did not care for
 

3491
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:29,910
was that americans did not care for
president

3492
01:08:29,910 --> 01:08:29,920
president
 

3493
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:33,510
president
bush or his policies in iraq

3494
01:08:33,510 --> 01:08:33,520
bush or his policies in iraq
 

3495
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:36,630
bush or his policies in iraq
in controlled conditions but if we

3496
01:08:36,630 --> 01:08:36,640
in controlled conditions but if we
 

3497
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:37,990
in controlled conditions but if we
reminded them of their

3498
01:08:37,990 --> 01:08:38,000
reminded them of their
 

3499
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:41,349
reminded them of their
mortality first they like bush a lot

3500
01:08:41,349 --> 01:08:41,359
mortality first they like bush a lot
 

3501
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:41,910
mortality first they like bush a lot
more

3502
01:08:41,910 --> 01:08:41,920
more
 

3503
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:44,709
more
so in every study that we did americans

3504
01:08:44,709 --> 01:08:44,719
so in every study that we did americans
 

3505
01:08:44,719 --> 01:08:45,110
so in every study that we did americans
like

3506
01:08:45,110 --> 01:08:45,120
like
 

3507
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:48,229
like
john kerry who was running against bush

3508
01:08:48,229 --> 01:08:48,239
john kerry who was running against bush
 

3509
01:08:48,239 --> 01:08:52,789
john kerry who was running against bush
they like carrie more than bush

3510
01:08:52,789 --> 01:08:52,799

 

3511
01:08:52,799 --> 01:08:55,749

in a control condition yeah and but if

3512
01:08:55,749 --> 01:08:55,759
in a control condition yeah and but if
 

3513
01:08:55,759 --> 01:08:57,910
in a control condition yeah and but if
if they were reminded of death

3514
01:08:57,910 --> 01:08:57,920
if they were reminded of death
 

3515
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:01,749
if they were reminded of death
first then they like bush a lot more

3516
01:09:01,749 --> 01:09:01,759
first then they like bush a lot more
 

3517
01:09:01,759 --> 01:09:03,590
first then they like bush a lot more
so by the way just a small pause you

3518
01:09:03,590 --> 01:09:03,600
so by the way just a small pause you
 

3519
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:05,110
so by the way just a small pause you
said they're disseminally simple

3520
01:09:05,110 --> 01:09:05,120
said they're disseminally simple
 

3521
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:06,149
said they're disseminally simple
experiments

3522
01:09:06,149 --> 01:09:06,159
experiments
 

3523
01:09:06,159 --> 01:09:08,709
experiments
i think that's um and people should read

3524
01:09:08,709 --> 01:09:08,719
i think that's um and people should read
 

3525
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:09,189
i think that's um and people should read
uh

3526
01:09:09,189 --> 01:09:09,199
uh
 

3527
01:09:09,199 --> 01:09:10,630
uh
warm at the core for some other

3528
01:09:10,630 --> 01:09:10,640
warm at the core for some other
 

3529
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:12,390
warm at the core for some other
descriptions you have a lot of

3530
01:09:12,390 --> 01:09:12,400
descriptions you have a lot of
 

3531
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:14,149
descriptions you have a lot of
different experiences of this nature i

3532
01:09:14,149 --> 01:09:14,159
different experiences of this nature i
 

3533
01:09:14,159 --> 01:09:15,590
different experiences of this nature i
think it's a brilliant

3534
01:09:15,590 --> 01:09:15,600
think it's a brilliant
 

3535
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:19,510
think it's a brilliant
experiment um connected to the stoics

3536
01:09:19,510 --> 01:09:19,520
experiment um connected to the stoics
 

3537
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:20,709
experiment um connected to the stoics
perhaps

3538
01:09:20,709 --> 01:09:20,719
perhaps
 

3539
01:09:20,719 --> 01:09:23,510
perhaps
of uh how your world view on anything

3540
01:09:23,510 --> 01:09:23,520
of uh how your world view on anything
 

3541
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:25,430
of uh how your world view on anything
and how delicious that water tastes

3542
01:09:25,430 --> 01:09:25,440
and how delicious that water tastes
 

3543
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:28,070
and how delicious that water tastes
yes after you're reminded of your own

3544
01:09:28,070 --> 01:09:28,080
yes after you're reminded of your own
 

3545
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:29,669
yes after you're reminded of your own
mortality it's such a fascinating

01:09:29,669 --> 01:09:29,679
mortality it's such a fascinating
 

3547
01:09:29,679 --> 01:09:30,470

their desk
 

3665
01:11:48,159 --> 01:11:52,070
their desk
and the whole idea i should back up a

3666
01:11:52,070 --> 01:11:52,080
and the whole idea i should back up a
 

3667
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:55,030
and the whole idea i should back up a
bit because and just remind folks that

3668
01:11:55,030 --> 01:11:55,040
bit because and just remind folks that
 

3669
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:57,590
bit because and just remind folks that
our studies you know when we remind

3670
01:11:57,590 --> 01:11:57,600
our studies you know when we remind
 

3671
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:59,350
our studies you know when we remind
people that they're going to die

3672
01:11:59,350 --> 01:11:59,360
people that they're going to die

it changes who they vote for but all of

3686
01:12:19,750 --> 01:12:19,760
it changes who they vote for but all of
 

3687
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:20,550
it changes who they vote for but all of
those things

3688
01:12:20,550 --> 01:12:20,560
those things
 

3689
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:23,110
those things
those are very subtle death reminders

3690
01:12:23,110 --> 01:12:23,120
those are very subtle death reminders
 

3691
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:24,709
those are very subtle death reminders
you don't even know that death is on

3692
01:12:24,709 --> 01:12:24,719
you don't even know that death is on
 

3693
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:25,910
you don't even know that death is on
your mind

3694
01:12:25,910 --> 01:12:25,920
your mind
 

3695
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:29,110
your mind
and so our point is is that and this is

3696
01:12:29,110 --> 01:12:29,120
and so our point is is that and this is
 

3697
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:31,189
and so our point is is that and this is
kind of counterintuitive and that is

3698
01:12:31,189 --> 01:12:31,199
kind of counterintuitive and that is
 

3699
01:12:31,199 --> 01:12:32,709
kind of counterintuitive and that is
that

3700
01:12:32,709 --> 01:12:32,719
that
 

3701
01:12:32,719 --> 01:12:36,550
that
the most problematic and unsavory

3702
01:12:36,550 --> 01:12:36,560
the most problematic and unsavory
 

3703
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:39,750
the most problematic and unsavory
human reactions to death anxiety

3704
01:12:39,750 --> 01:12:39,760
human reactions to death anxiety
 

3705
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:41,990
human reactions to death anxiety
are malignant manifestations of

3706
01:12:41,990 --> 01:12:42,000
are malignant manifestations of
 

3707
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:42,950
are malignant manifestations of

3708
01:12:42,950 --> 01:12:42,960
repressed
 

3709
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:45,350
repressed
death anxiety you know we try and bury

3710
01:12:45,350 --> 01:12:45,360
death anxiety you know we try and bury
 

3711
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:47,270
death anxiety you know we try and bury
it under the psychological bushes and

3712
01:12:47,270 --> 01:12:47,280
it under the psychological bushes and
 

3713
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:50,149
it under the psychological bushes and
then it comes back to bear bitter fruit

3714
01:12:50,149 --> 01:12:50,159
then it comes back to bear bitter fruit
 

3715
01:12:50,159 --> 01:12:52,790
then it comes back to bear bitter fruit
but what the theologians and the

even the social role that you occupy you

even the social role that you occupy you
 

3981
01:18:28,719 --> 01:18:29,910
even the social role that you occupy you
might have chosen

01:18:34,070 --> 01:18:34,080
but not from the full palette
 

3987
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:36,870
but not from the full palette
of human opportunities and so what

3988
01:18:36,870 --> 01:18:36,880
of human opportunities and so what
 

3989
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:38,870
of human opportunities and so what
kierkegaard said is that

3990
01:18:38,870 --> 01:18:38,880
kierkegaard said is that
 

3991
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:42,550
kierkegaard said is that
we need to realize that

3992
01:18:42,550 --> 01:18:42,560
we need to realize that
 

3993
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:46,149
we need to realize that
we've been living a lie of sorts

3994
01:18:46,149 --> 01:18:46,159
we've been living a lie of sorts
 

3995
01:18:46,159 --> 01:18:49,350
we've been living a lie of sorts
becker calls it a necessary lie

3996
01:18:49,350 --> 01:18:49,360
becker calls it a necessary lie
 

3997
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:52,709
becker calls it a necessary lie
and and we have to momentarily

3998
01:18:52,709 --> 01:18:52,719
and and we have to momentarily
 

3999
01:18:52,719 --> 01:18:56,070
and and we have to momentarily
dispose of that and so now kierkegaard

4000
01:18:56,070 --> 01:18:56,080
dispose of that and so now kierkegaard
 

4001
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:57,510
dispose of that and so now kierkegaard
says well here i am

4002
01:18:57,510 --> 01:18:57,520
says well here i am
 

4003
01:18:57,520 --> 01:19:00,790
says well here i am
i i have shrugged off

4004
01:19:00,790 --> 01:19:00,800
i i have shrugged off
 

4005
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:03,669
i i have shrugged off
all of the cultural accoutrements that i

4006
01:19:03,669 --> 01:19:03,679
all of the cultural accoutrements that i
 

4007
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:04,950
all of the cultural accoutrements that i
have used

4008
01:19:04,950 --> 01:19:04,960
have used
 

4009
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:08,070
have used
uh to define myself

4010
01:19:08,070 --> 01:19:08,080
uh to define myself
 

4011
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:11,430
uh to define myself
and now what am i or who am i this is

4012
01:19:11,430 --> 01:19:11,440
and now what am i or who am i this is
 

4013
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:13,750
and now what am i or who am i this is
like the ancient greek tragedy where the

4014
01:19:13,750 --> 01:19:13,760
like the ancient greek tragedy where the
 

4015
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:15,430
like the ancient greek tragedy where the
worst thing was to be

4016
01:19:15,430 --> 01:19:15,440
worst thing was to be
 

4017
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:18,870
worst thing was to be
no one or no thing

4018
01:19:18,870 --> 01:19:18,880
no one or no thing
 

4019
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:21,350
no one or no thing
all right at this point kierkegaard said

4020
01:19:21,350 --> 01:19:21,360
all right at this point kierkegaard said
 

4021
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:23,990
all right at this point kierkegaard said
you're really dangling on the precipice

4022
01:19:23,990 --> 01:19:24,000
you're really dangling on the precipice
 

4023
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:27,590
you're really dangling on the precipice
of oblivion and some people tumble into

4024
01:19:27,590 --> 01:19:27,600
of oblivion and some people tumble into
 

4025
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:29,030
of oblivion and some people tumble into
that abyss

4026
01:19:29,030 --> 01:19:29,040
that abyss
 

4027
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:32,630
that abyss
and never come out on the other hand

4028
01:19:32,630 --> 01:19:32,640
and never come out on the other hand
 

4029
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:35,189
and never come out on the other hand
kierkegaard said that what you can now

4030
01:19:35,189 --> 01:19:35,199
kierkegaard said that what you can now
 

4031
01:19:35,199 --> 01:19:37,590
kierkegaard said that what you can now
do metaphorically and literally is to

4032
01:19:37,590 --> 01:19:37,600
do metaphorically and literally is to
 

4033
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:40,470
do metaphorically and literally is to
rebuild yourself from the ground up

4034
01:19:40,470 --> 01:19:40,480
rebuild yourself from the ground up
 

4035
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:42,149
rebuild yourself from the ground up
and there's a in the new testament

4036
01:19:42,149 --> 01:19:42,159
and there's a in the new testament
 

4037
01:19:42,159 --> 01:19:43,750
and there's a in the new testament
there's something you have to die in

4038
01:19:43,750 --> 01:19:43,760
there's something you have to die in
 

4039
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:45,750
there's something you have to die in
order to be reborn

4040
01:19:45,750 --> 01:19:45,760
order to be reborn
 

4041
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:48,149
order to be reborn
and kierkegaard's view though is that

4042
01:19:48,149 --> 01:19:48,159
and kierkegaard's view though is that
 

4043
01:19:48,159 --> 01:19:50,149
and kierkegaard's view though is that
there's only one way to do that this is

4044
01:19:50,149 --> 01:19:50,159
there's only one way to do that this is

01:19:55,270 --> 01:19:55,280
leap into faith and in kierkegaard's
 

4049
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:58,709
leap into faith and in kierkegaard's

i i think these ideas
 

4641
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:28,149
i i think these ideas
are consistent with what becker is

4642
01:32:28,149 --> 01:32:28,159
are consistent with what becker is
 

4643

as an alternative to
 

4651
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:42,149
as an alternative to
the kierkegaardian insistence that the

psychologists because that's

5000
01:39:19,830 --> 01:39:19,840
psychologists because that's
 

5001
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:23,030
psychologists because that's
who we intersected with that

5002
01:39:23,030 --> 01:39:23,040
who we intersected with that
 

5003
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:26,149
who we intersected with that
you know we would lay out these ideas

5004
01:39:26,149 --> 01:39:26,159
you know we would lay out these ideas
 

5005
01:39:26,159 --> 01:39:29,430
you know we would lay out these ideas
and they would be well i don't think

01:39:42,790 --> 01:39:42,800
enough to be comfortably ensconced in a
 

5019
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:44,790
enough to be comfortably ensconced in a
cultural world view from which you

5020
01:39:44,790 --> 01:39:44,800
cultural world view from which you
 

5021
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:46,629
cultural world view from which you
derive self-esteem

5022
01:39:46,629 --> 01:39:46,639

01:39:51,199 --> 01:39:53,189
existential excruciations that would
otherwise arise

a thought experiment
 

5177
01:42:33,520 --> 01:42:35,430
a thought experiment
that like basically step outside the

5178
01:42:35,430 --> 01:42:35,440
that like basically step outside the
 

5179
01:42:35,440 --> 01:42:37,270
that like basically step outside the
little narrative that we

5180
01:42:37,270 --> 01:42:37,280
little narrative that we
 

5181
01:42:37,280 --> 01:42:39,510
little narrative that we
are comfortable with now that one in

particular

5184
01:42:40,390 --> 01:42:40,400
particular
 

5185
01:42:40,400 --> 01:42:44,149
particular
is has a really strong

5186
01:42:44,149 --> 01:42:44,159
is has a really strong
 

5187
01:42:44,159 --> 01:42:47,750
is has a really strong
uh evidence uh and scientific validation

5188
01:42:47,750 --> 01:42:47,760
uh evidence uh and scientific validation
 

5189
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:50,149
uh evidence uh and scientific validation
so on it's pretty simple thing to show

5190
01:42:50,149 --> 01:42:50,159
so on it's pretty simple thing to show
 

5191
01:42:50,159 --> 01:42:53,510
so on it's pretty simple thing to show
that it at least is not flat uh but

5192
01:42:53,510 --> 01:42:53,520
that it at least is not flat uh but
 

5193
01:42:53,520 --> 01:42:56,870
that it at least is not flat uh but
just the willingness to take a step

5194
01:42:56,870 --> 01:42:56,880
just the willingness to take a step
 

5195
01:42:56,880 --> 01:42:59,270
just the willingness to take a step
outside of the stories that bring us

5196
01:42:59,270 --> 01:42:59,280
outside of the stories that bring us
 

5197
01:42:59,280 --> 01:43:00,149
outside of the stories that bring us
comfort

5198
01:43:00,149 --> 01:43:00,159
comfort
 

5199
01:43:00,159 --> 01:43:02,070
comfort
it's uh been disappointing that people

5200
01:43:02,070 --> 01:43:02,080
it's uh been disappointing that people
 

5201
01:43:02,080 --> 01:43:04,070
it's uh been disappointing that people
are not willing to do that

5202
01:43:04,070 --> 01:43:04,080
are not willing to do that
 

5203
01:43:04,080 --> 01:43:06,470
are not willing to do that

another cave the illumination may be
 

5851
01:56:29,599 --> 01:56:30,310
another cave the illumination may be
better

5852
01:56:30,310 --> 01:56:30,320
better
 

5853
01:56:30,320 --> 01:56:34,470
better
right but the minute you think

5854
01:56:34,470 --> 01:56:34,480
right but the minute you think
 

5855
01:56:34,480 --> 01:56:38,629
right but the minute you think
you're at the end of the proverbial

5856
01:56:38,629 --> 01:56:38,639
you're at the end of the proverbial
 

5857
01:56:38,639 --> 01:56:44,950
you're at the end of the proverbial
intellectual slash epistemological trail

5858
01:56:44,950 --> 01:56:44,960
intellectual slash epistemological trail
 

5859
01:56:44,960 --> 01:56:48,550
intellectual slash epistemological trail
then you have already succumbed

5860
01:56:48,550 --> 01:56:48,560
then you have already succumbed
 

5861
01:56:48,560 --> 01:56:51,109
then you have already succumbed
to either laziness or dogmatism or both

5862
01:56:51,109 --> 01:56:51,119
to either laziness or dogmatism or both
 

5863
01:56:51,119 --> 01:56:52,870
to either laziness or dogmatism or both
that's really well put

5864
01:56:52,870 --> 01:56:52,880
that's really well put
 

5865
01:56:52,880 --> 01:56:55,030
that's really well put
that's both terrifying and exciting that

5866
01:56:55,030 --> 01:56:55,040
that's both terrifying and exciting that
 

5867
01:56:55,040 --> 01:56:56,310
that's both terrifying and exciting that
we're always it's

5868
01:56:56,310 --> 01:56:56,320
we're always it's
 

5869
01:56:56,320 --> 01:56:59,350
we're always it's
uh there's always a bigger cave

5870
01:56:59,350 --> 01:56:59,360
uh there's always a bigger cave
 

5871
01:56:59,360 --> 01:57:01,270
uh there's always a bigger cave
a little bit of an outdoor question but

5872
01:57:01,270 --> 01:57:01,280
a little bit of an outdoor question but
 

5873
01:57:01,280 --> 01:57:02,470
a little bit of an outdoor question but
i think some of the

5874
01:57:02,470 --> 01:57:02,480
i think some of the
 

5875
01:57:02,480 --> 01:57:06,310
i think some of the
interesting qualities of the human mind

5876
01:57:06,310 --> 01:57:06,320
interesting qualities of the human mind
 

5877
01:57:06,320 --> 01:57:08,830
interesting qualities of the human mind
is the ideas of intelligence and

5878
01:57:08,830 --> 01:57:08,840
is the ideas of intelligence and
 

5879
01:57:08,840 --> 01:57:10,629
is the ideas of intelligence and
consciousness

5880
01:57:10,629 --> 01:57:10,639
consciousness
 

5881
01:57:10,639 --> 01:57:13,189
consciousness
so what do you make of consciousness so

5882
01:57:13,189 --> 01:57:13,199
so what do you make of consciousness so
 

5883
01:57:13,199 --> 01:57:14,149
so what do you make of consciousness so
do you think

5884
01:57:14,149 --> 01:57:14,159
do you think
 

5885
01:57:14,159 --> 01:57:17,189
do you think
death creates

5886
01:57:17,189 --> 01:57:17,199
death creates
 

5887
01:57:17,199 --> 01:57:19,830
death creates
consciousness like the fear of death the

5888
01:57:19,830 --> 01:57:19,840
consciousness like the fear of death the
 

5889
01:57:19,840 --> 01:57:21,990
consciousness like the fear of death the
terror of death creates consciousness

5890
01:57:21,990 --> 01:57:22,000
terror of death creates consciousness
 

5891
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:25,189
terror of death creates consciousness
and um consciousness

5892
01:57:25,189 --> 01:57:25,199
and um consciousness
 

5893
01:57:25,199 --> 01:57:28,709
and um consciousness
in turn magnifies

5894
01:57:28,709 --> 01:57:28,719
in turn magnifies
 

5895
01:57:28,719 --> 01:57:31,990
in turn magnifies
the terror of death i do um i i think

5896
01:57:31,990 --> 01:57:32,000
the terror of death i do um i i think
 

5897
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:33,109
the terror of death i do um i i think
what is consciousness

5898
01:57:33,109 --> 01:57:33,119
what is consciousness
 

5899
01:57:33,119 --> 01:57:36,229
what is consciousness
to you oh don't ask me that so now

5900
01:57:36,229 --> 01:57:36,239
to you oh don't ask me that so now
 

5901
01:57:36,239 --> 01:57:37,990
to you oh don't ask me that so now
if i could answer that you know i'd be

5902
01:57:37,990 --> 01:57:38,000
if i could answer that you know i'd be
 

5903

nobel prize that
 

5907
01:57:41,199 --> 01:57:44,629
nobel prize that
um you know it's literally

01:57:44,639 --> 01:57:46,629
um you know it's literally
you know stephen pinker i do agree with

5910
01:57:46,629 --> 01:57:46,639
you know stephen pinker i do agree with
 

5911
01:57:46,639 --> 01:57:47,990
you know stephen pinker i do agree with
his claim

5912
01:57:47,990 --> 01:57:48,000
his claim
 

5913
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:49,830
his claim
and i think how the mind works that it

5914
01:57:49,830 --> 01:57:49,840
and i think how the mind works that it
 

5915
01:57:49,840 --> 01:57:51,350
and i think how the mind works that it
is the

5916
01:57:51,350 --> 01:57:51,360
is the
 

5917
01:57:51,360 --> 01:57:55,990
is the
key question for

5918
01:57:55,990 --> 01:57:56,000
key question for
 

5919
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,390
key question for
the psychological sciences broadly

5920
01:57:58,390 --> 01:57:58,400
the psychological sciences broadly
 

5921
01:57:58,400 --> 01:58:00,229
the psychological sciences broadly
defined in the

5922
01:58:00,229 --> 01:58:00,239
defined in the
 

5923
01:58:00,239 --> 01:58:02,470
defined in the
21st century what is conscious yeah what

5924
01:58:02,470 --> 01:58:02,480
21st century what is conscious yeah what
 

5925
01:58:02,480 --> 01:58:03,830
21st century what is conscious yeah what
is consciousness

5926

is consciousness
 

5927
01:58:03,840 --> 01:58:06,870
is consciousness
and i don't think it's an

5928
01:58:06,870 --> 01:58:06,880
and i don't think it's an
 

5929
01:58:06,880 --> 01:58:09,830
and i don't think it's an
epi phenomenological afterthought so a

5930
01:58:09,830 --> 01:58:09,840
epi phenomenological afterthought so a
 

5931
01:58:09,840 --> 01:58:11,270
epi phenomenological afterthought so a
lot of people

5932
01:58:11,270 --> 01:58:11,280
lot of people
 

5933
01:58:11,280 --> 01:58:14,470
lot of people
i think dan wagner at harvard uh a lot

5934
01:58:14,470 --> 01:58:14,480
i think dan wagner at harvard uh a lot
 

5935
01:58:14,480 --> 01:58:15,270
i think dan wagner at harvard uh a lot
of folks

5936
01:58:15,270 --> 01:58:15,280
of folks
 

5937
01:58:15,280 --> 01:58:18,950
of folks
consider it just the ass end of a

5938
01:58:18,950 --> 01:58:18,960
consider it just the ass end of a
 

5939
01:58:18,960 --> 01:58:21,030
consider it just the ass end of a
process

5940
01:58:21,030 --> 01:58:21,040
process
 

5941
01:58:21,040 --> 01:58:24,470
process
that by the time we are

5942
01:58:24,470 --> 01:58:24,480
that by the time we are
 

5943
01:58:24,480 --> 01:58:28,550
that by the time we are
aware of what it is it's just basically

5944
01:58:28,550 --> 01:58:28,560
aware of what it is it's just basically
 

5945
01:58:28,560 --> 01:58:31,270
aware of what it is it's just basically
an integrated rendering of something

5946
01:58:31,270 --> 01:58:31,280
an integrated rendering of something
 

5947
01:58:31,280 --> 01:58:32,790
an integrated rendering of something
that's already

5948
01:58:32,790 --> 01:58:32,800
that's already
 

5949
01:58:32,800 --> 01:58:35,589
that's already
happened you know evidently the there's

5950
01:58:35,589 --> 01:58:35,599
happened you know evidently the there's
 

5951
01:58:35,599 --> 01:58:37,750
happened you know evidently the there's
a half-second delay between when

5952
01:58:37,750 --> 01:58:37,760
a half-second delay between when
 

5953
01:58:37,760 --> 01:58:39,589
a half-second delay between when
something happens you know those studies

5954
01:58:39,589 --> 01:58:39,599
something happens you know those studies
 

5955
01:58:39,599 --> 01:58:40,149
something happens you know those studies
and

5956
01:58:40,149 --> 01:58:40,159
and
 

5957
01:58:40,159 --> 01:58:43,589
and
our awareness of it um um yeah and

5958
01:58:43,589 --> 01:58:43,599
our awareness of it um um yeah and
 

5959
01:58:43,599 --> 01:58:45,270
our awareness of it um um yeah and
that's where like ideas of free will

5960
01:58:45,270 --> 01:58:45,280
that's where like ideas of free will
 

5961
01:58:45,280 --> 01:58:47,350
that's where like ideas of free will
will step in yeah you can explain away a

5962
01:58:47,350 --> 01:58:47,360
will step in yeah you can explain away a
 

5963
01:58:47,360 --> 01:58:47,990
will step in yeah you can explain away a
lot of stuff

5964
01:58:47,990 --> 01:58:48,000
lot of stuff
 

5965
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,550
lot of stuff
and i think those are all important and

5966
01:58:50,550 --> 01:58:50,560
and i think those are all important and
 

5967
01:58:50,560 --> 01:58:51,350
and i think those are all important and
interesting

5968
01:58:51,350 --> 01:58:51,360
interesting
 

5969
01:58:51,360 --> 01:58:55,189
interesting
questions uh i'm of the persuasion

5970
01:58:55,189 --> 01:58:55,199
questions uh i'm of the persuasion
 

5971
01:58:55,199 --> 01:58:58,390
questions uh i'm of the persuasion
i mean even not even but the

5972
01:58:58,390 --> 01:58:58,400
i mean even not even but the
 

5973
01:58:58,400 --> 01:59:03,830
i mean even not even but the
dawkins in the selfish gene um

5974
01:59:03,830 --> 01:59:03,840
dawkins in the selfish gene um
 

5975
01:59:03,840 --> 01:59:06,629
dawkins in the selfish gene um
is very thoughtful actually in a lot of

5976
01:59:06,629 --> 01:59:06,639
is very thoughtful actually in a lot of
 

5977
01:59:06,639 --> 01:59:08,149
is very thoughtful actually in a lot of
it's actually more in

5978
01:59:08,149 --> 01:59:08,159
it's actually more in
 

5979
01:59:08,159 --> 01:59:11,030
it's actually more in
notes than in the text of the book but

5980
01:59:11,030 --> 01:59:11,040
notes than in the text of the book but
 

5981
01:59:11,040 --> 01:59:11,910
notes than in the text of the book but
he's just like

5982
01:59:11,910 --> 01:59:11,920
he's just like
 

5983
01:59:11,920 --> 01:59:14,870
he's just like
it's hard for me to imagine that

5984
01:59:14,870 --> 01:59:14,880
it's hard for me to imagine that
 

5985
01:59:14,880 --> 01:59:17,189
it's hard for me to imagine that
consciousness

5986
01:59:17,189 --> 01:59:17,199
consciousness
 

5987
01:59:17,199 --> 01:59:20,870
consciousness
doesn't have some sort of

5988
01:59:20,870 --> 01:59:20,880
doesn't have some sort of
 

5989
01:59:20,880 --> 01:59:24,790
doesn't have some sort of
important and highly adaptive function

5990
01:59:24,790 --> 01:59:24,800
important and highly adaptive function
 

5991
01:59:24,800 --> 01:59:27,669
important and highly adaptive function
and what dawkins says is he thought

5992
01:59:27,669 --> 01:59:27,679
and what dawkins says is he thought
 

5993
01:59:27,679 --> 01:59:29,430
and what dawkins says is he thought
about it in terms of

5994
01:59:29,430 --> 01:59:29,440
about it in terms of
 

5995
01:59:29,440 --> 01:59:31,350
about it in terms of
just the that we can do mental

5996
01:59:31,350 --> 01:59:31,360
just the that we can do mental
 

5997
01:59:31,360 --> 01:59:32,870
just the that we can do mental
simulations

5998
01:59:32,870 --> 01:59:32,880
simulations
 

5999
01:59:32,880 --> 01:59:36,070
simulations
that uh one possibly

6000
01:59:36,070 --> 01:59:36,080
that uh one possibly
 

6001
01:59:36,080 --> 01:59:38,790
that uh one possibly
extraordinary product of consciousness

6002
01:59:38,790 --> 01:59:38,800
extraordinary product of consciousness
 

6003
01:59:38,800 --> 01:59:39,350
extraordinary product of consciousness
is

6004
01:59:39,350 --> 01:59:39,360
is
 

6005
01:59:39,360 --> 01:59:43,430
is
to rather than find out

6006
01:59:43,430 --> 01:59:43,440
to rather than find out
 

6007
01:59:43,440 --> 01:59:47,830
to rather than find out
often um by adverse consequences through

6008
01:59:47,830 --> 01:59:47,840
often um by adverse consequences through
 

6009
01:59:47,840 --> 01:59:49,189
often um by adverse consequences through
trying something

6010
01:59:49,189 --> 01:59:49,199
trying something
 

6011
01:59:49,199 --> 01:59:51,510
trying something
would be to run mental simulations and

6012
01:59:51,510 --> 01:59:51,520
would be to run mental simulations and
 

6013
01:59:51,520 --> 01:59:53,589
would be to run mental simulations and
so one possibility

6014
01:59:53,589 --> 01:59:53,599
so one possibility
 

6015
01:59:53,599 --> 01:59:56,870
so one possibility
is that consciousness is highly adaptive

6016
01:59:56,870 --> 01:59:56,880
is that consciousness is highly adaptive
 

6017
01:59:56,880 --> 01:59:59,189
is that consciousness is highly adaptive
another possibility is uh nicholas

6018
01:59:59,189 --> 01:59:59,199
another possibility is uh nicholas
 

6019
01:59:59,199 --> 02:00:00,149
another possibility is uh nicholas

british dude who wrote a book about i

6022
02:00:02,470 --> 02:00:02,480
british dude who wrote a book about i
 

6023
02:00:02,480 --> 02:00:03,910
british dude who wrote a book about i
think it's called regaining

6024
02:00:03,910 --> 02:00:03,920
think it's called regaining
 

6025
02:00:03,920 --> 02:00:05,510
think it's called regaining
consciousness

6026
02:00:05,510 --> 02:00:05,520
consciousness
 

6027
02:00:05,520 --> 02:00:09,030
consciousness
and he hypothesized i think this 1980s

6028
02:00:09,030 --> 02:00:09,040
and he hypothesized i think this 1980s
 

6029
02:00:09,040 --> 02:00:10,550
and he hypothesized i think this 1980s
maybe even earlier

6030
02:00:10,550 --> 02:00:10,560
maybe even earlier
 

6031
02:00:10,560 --> 02:00:14,310
maybe even earlier
the consciousness arose

6032
02:00:14,310 --> 02:00:14,320
the consciousness arose
 

6033
02:00:14,320 --> 02:00:17,990
the consciousness arose
as a way to better predict the behavior

6034
02:00:17,990 --> 02:00:18,000
as a way to better predict the behavior
 

6035
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:18,229
as a way to better predict the behavior
of

6036
02:00:18,229 --> 02:00:18,239
of

others in social settings that by

6038
02:00:20,550 --> 02:00:20,560
others in social settings that by
 

6039
02:00:20,560 --> 02:00:21,350
others in social settings that by

6040
02:00:21,350 --> 02:00:21,360
knowing
 

6041
02:00:21,360 --> 02:00:25,270
knowing
how i feel makes me better able

6042
02:00:25,270 --> 02:00:25,280
how i feel makes me better able
 

6043
02:00:25,280 --> 02:00:28,149
how i feel makes me better able
to know how you may be feeling this like

6044
02:00:28,149 --> 02:00:28,159
to know how you may be feeling this like
 

6045
02:00:28,159 --> 02:00:30,950
to know how you may be feeling this like
the rudiments of a theory of mind

6046
02:00:30,950 --> 02:00:30,960
the rudiments of a theory of mind
 

6047
02:00:30,960 --> 02:00:33,669
the rudiments of a theory of mind
and that it really may not have had

6048
02:00:33,669 --> 02:00:33,679
and that it really may not have had
 

6049
02:00:33,679 --> 02:00:35,270
and that it really may not have had
anything to do with

6050
02:00:35,270 --> 02:00:35,280
anything to do with
 

6051
02:00:35,280 --> 02:00:38,149
anything to do with
intelligence so much as social

6052
02:00:38,149 --> 02:00:38,159
intelligence so much as social
 

6053
02:00:38,159 --> 02:00:39,669
intelligence so much as social
intelligence

6054
02:00:39,669 --> 02:00:39,679
intelligence
 

6055
02:00:39,679 --> 02:00:42,629
intelligence
right so so in that sense consciousness

6056
02:00:42,629 --> 02:00:42,639
right so so in that sense consciousness
 

6057
02:00:42,639 --> 02:00:43,510
right so so in that sense consciousness
is a

6058
02:00:43,510 --> 02:00:43,520
is a
 

6059
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:46,149
is a
social construct like yes it's just a

6060
02:00:46,149 --> 02:00:46,159
social construct like yes it's just a
 

6061
02:00:46,159 --> 02:00:47,270
social construct like yes it's just a
useful thing for us

6062
02:00:47,270 --> 02:00:47,280
useful thing for us
 

6063
02:00:47,280 --> 02:00:49,189
useful thing for us
interacting with other humans yeah i

about realizing your own mortality
 

6071

that's somehow intricately connected to
 

6073
02:00:59,199 --> 02:01:00,470
that's somehow intricately connected to
the idea of consciousness

6074
02:01:00,470 --> 02:01:00,480
the idea of consciousness
 

6075
02:01:00,480 --> 02:01:03,270
the idea of consciousness
well i think so also so this is where um

um he said a solitary creature
 

6081
02:01:08,480 --> 02:01:11,830
um he said a solitary creature
would not need consciousness

6082
02:01:11,830 --> 02:01:11,840
would not need consciousness
 

6083
02:01:11,840 --> 02:01:14,149
would not need consciousness
oh what do you think well i don't know

6084

but what i do and then he goes on to say
 

6089
02:01:17,360 --> 02:01:18,790
but what i do and then he goes on to say
that consciousness is the most

6090
02:01:18,790 --> 02:01:18,800
that consciousness is the most
 

6091
02:01:18,800 --> 02:01:21,109
that consciousness is the most
calamitous stupidity by which we shall

6092
02:01:21,109 --> 02:01:21,119
calamitous stupidity by which we shall
 

6093
02:01:21,119 --> 02:01:22,629
calamitous stupidity by which we shall
someday perish

6094
02:01:22,629 --> 02:01:22,639
someday perish
 

6095
02:01:22,639 --> 02:01:25,750

[Laughter]
but so what if you say you were on an

6102
02:01:31,990 --> 02:01:32,000
but so what if you say you were on an
 

6103
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:33,189
but so what if you say you were on an
island alone

6104
02:01:33,189 --> 02:01:33,199
island alone
 

6105
02:01:33,199 --> 02:01:36,550
island alone
and you saw a reflection of yourself in

6106
02:01:36,550 --> 02:01:36,560
and you saw a reflection of yourself in
 

6107
02:01:36,560 --> 02:01:40,310
and you saw a reflection of yourself in
in the water uh like if you were alone

6108
02:01:40,310 --> 02:01:40,320
in the water uh like if you were alone
 

6109
02:01:40,320 --> 02:01:40,950
in the water uh like if you were alone
your whole life

yeah great question his view
 

6113
02:01:44,159 --> 02:01:46,709
yeah great question his view
nietzsche's view would be that your

6114
02:01:46,709 --> 02:01:46,719
nietzsche's view would be that your
 

6115
02:01:46,719 --> 02:01:48,830
nietzsche's view would be that your
thoughts of yourself would never come to

6116
02:01:48,830 --> 02:01:48,840
thoughts of yourself would never come to
 

6117
02:01:48,840 --> 02:01:50,229
thoughts of yourself would never come to
mind

mind
 

6119
02:01:50,239 --> 02:01:51,589

i don't know how i feel about that
 

6121
02:01:51,599 --> 02:01:54,149
i don't know how i feel about that
though in a sense

6122
02:01:54,149 --> 02:01:54,159
though in a sense
 

6123
02:01:54,159 --> 02:01:57,189
though in a sense
this sounds weird but in a sense

6124
02:01:57,189 --> 02:01:57,199
this sounds weird but in a sense
 

6125
02:01:57,199 --> 02:02:00,470
this sounds weird but in a sense
i feel like my mental conversation has

6126
02:02:00,470 --> 02:02:00,480
i feel like my mental conversation has
 

6127
02:02:00,480 --> 02:02:01,430
i feel like my mental conversation has
always been with

6128
02:02:01,430 --> 02:02:01,440
always been with
 

6129
02:02:01,440 --> 02:02:03,910
always been with
death it's almost like another you know

6130
02:02:03,910 --> 02:02:03,920
death it's almost like another you know
 

6131
02:02:03,920 --> 02:02:05,350
death it's almost like another you know
um

6132
02:02:05,350 --> 02:02:05,360
um
 

6133
02:02:05,360 --> 02:02:08,790
um
another notion like um

6134
02:02:08,790 --> 02:02:08,800
another notion like um
 

6135
02:02:08,800 --> 02:02:11,030
another notion like um
you know there's these visualizations of

6136
02:02:11,030 --> 02:02:11,040
you know there's these visualizations of
 

6137
02:02:11,040 --> 02:02:12,870
you know there's these visualizations of
yeah of a death in the cloak

6138
02:02:12,870 --> 02:02:12,880
yeah of a death in the cloak
 

6139
02:02:12,880 --> 02:02:16,390
yeah of a death in the cloak
like i always felt like i am a living

6140
02:02:16,390 --> 02:02:16,400
like i always felt like i am a living
 

6141
02:02:16,400 --> 02:02:17,430
like i always felt like i am a living
thing

6142
02:02:17,430 --> 02:02:17,440
thing
 

6143
02:02:17,440 --> 02:02:20,070
thing
and then there's an other thing that is

6144
02:02:20,070 --> 02:02:20,080
and then there's an other thing that is
 

6145
02:02:20,080 --> 02:02:22,550
and then there's an other thing that is
the end of me

6146
02:02:22,550 --> 02:02:22,560
the end of me
 

6147
02:02:22,560 --> 02:02:24,229
the end of me
and i'm having like a conversation with

6148
02:02:24,229 --> 02:02:24,239
and i'm having like a conversation with
 

6149
02:02:24,239 --> 02:02:25,669
and i'm having like a conversation with
that so in the sense that's

6150
02:02:25,669 --> 02:02:25,679
that so in the sense that's
 

6151
02:02:25,679 --> 02:02:29,830
that so in the sense that's
uh that's the way i construct my

6152
02:02:29,830 --> 02:02:29,840
uh that's the way i construct my
 

6153
02:02:29,840 --> 02:02:32,950
uh that's the way i construct my
the fact that i am a thing is because

6154
02:02:32,950 --> 02:02:32,960
the fact that i am a thing is because
 

6155
02:02:32,960 --> 02:02:33,830
the fact that i am a thing is because
there's

6156
02:02:33,830 --> 02:02:33,840
there's
 

6157
02:02:33,840 --> 02:02:36,550
there's
somebody else that tells me well you

6158
02:02:36,550 --> 02:02:36,560
somebody else that tells me well you
 

6159
02:02:36,560 --> 02:02:38,310
somebody else that tells me well you
won't be a thing

6160
02:02:38,310 --> 02:02:38,320
won't be a thing
 

6161
02:02:38,320 --> 02:02:40,629
won't be a thing
uh eventually wow so it feels like a

6162
02:02:40,629 --> 02:02:40,639
uh eventually wow so it feels like a
 

6163
02:02:40,639 --> 02:02:41,750
uh eventually wow so it feels like a
conversation

6164
02:02:41,750 --> 02:02:41,760
conversation
 

6165
02:02:41,760 --> 02:02:44,550
conversation
uh perhaps but that's uh that might be

6166
02:02:44,550 --> 02:02:44,560
uh perhaps but that's uh that might be
 

6167
02:02:44,560 --> 02:02:45,350
uh perhaps but that's uh that might be
kind of this

6168
02:02:45,350 --> 02:02:45,360
kind of this
 

6169
02:02:45,360 --> 02:02:47,189
kind of this
mental stimulation kind of idea that

6170
02:02:47,189 --> 02:02:47,199
mental stimulation kind of idea that
 

6171
02:02:47,199 --> 02:02:48,870
mental stimulation kind of idea that
you're you're kind of

6172
02:02:48,870 --> 02:02:48,880
you're you're kind of
 

6173
02:02:48,880 --> 02:02:50,629
you're you're kind of
it's not really it's a conversation with

6174
02:02:50,629 --> 02:02:50,639
it's not really it's a conversation with
 

6175
02:02:50,639 --> 02:02:52,629
it's not really it's a conversation with
yourself essentially sure

6176
02:02:52,629 --> 02:02:52,639

so
 

6351
02:06:03,760 --> 02:06:06,790
so
what what we say lex is that

6352
02:06:06,790 --> 02:06:06,800
what what we say lex is that
 

6353
02:06:06,800 --> 02:06:09,589
what what we say lex is that
our goal certainly when we first started

6354
02:06:09,589 --> 02:06:09,599
our goal certainly when we first started
 

6355
02:06:09,599 --> 02:06:10,550
our goal certainly when we first started
and now

6356
02:06:10,550 --> 02:06:10,560
and now
 

6357
02:06:10,560 --> 02:06:13,589
and now
just as much actually but what i say at

6358
02:06:13,589 --> 02:06:13,599
just as much actually but what i say at
 

6359
02:06:13,599 --> 02:06:14,870
just as much actually but what i say at
all my talks is

6360
02:06:14,870 --> 02:06:14,880
all my talks is
 

6361
02:06:14,880 --> 02:06:16,870
all my talks is
look if these ideas have interest you

6362

02:06:39,589 --> 02:06:39,599
because point by point
 

6381
02:06:39,599 --> 02:06:43,030

i'm like well let's do a study let's do

6404
02:07:09,030 --> 02:07:09,040
i'm like well let's do a study let's do
 

6405

a study
and my own dreams are in creating

6408
02:07:13,750 --> 02:07:13,760
and my own dreams are in creating
 

6409
02:07:13,760 --> 02:07:16,790
and my own dreams are in creating
uh robots and artificial intelligence

6410
02:07:16,790 --> 02:07:16,800
uh robots and artificial intelligence
 

6411
02:07:16,800 --> 02:07:18,550
uh robots and artificial intelligence
systems that a human can love

6412
02:07:18,550 --> 02:07:18,560
systems that a human can love
 

6413
02:07:18,560 --> 02:07:21,669
systems that a human can love
and i think there's something

6414
02:07:21,669 --> 02:07:21,679
and i think there's something
 

6415
02:07:21,679 --> 02:07:24,629
and i think there's something
about uh mortality and fear mortality

6416
02:07:24,629 --> 02:07:24,639
about uh mortality and fear mortality
 

6417
02:07:24,639 --> 02:07:25,589
about uh mortality and fear mortality
that is essential

6418
02:07:25,589 --> 02:07:25,599
that is essential
 

6419
02:07:25,599 --> 02:07:28,790
that is essential
for implementing in our ai systems

6420
02:07:28,790 --> 02:07:28,800
for implementing in our ai systems
 

6421
02:07:28,800 --> 02:07:31,910
for implementing in our ai systems
yeah and so maybe can you comment on

6422

6499
02:09:14,239 --> 02:09:15,910
uh having essentially existential
anxieties

6500
02:09:15,910 --> 02:09:15,920
anxieties
 

6501
02:09:15,920 --> 02:09:18,790
anxieties
and the i think the project is called a

6502
02:09:18,790 --> 02:09:18,800
and the i think the project is called a
 

6503
02:09:18,800 --> 02:09:20,629
and the i think the project is called a
dinner with her or something and it

6504
02:09:20,629 --> 02:09:20,639
dinner with her or something and it
 

6505
02:09:20,639 --> 02:09:22,390
dinner with her or something and it
doesn't really matter but the punch line

6506
02:09:22,390 --> 02:09:22,400
doesn't really matter but the punch line
 

6507
02:09:22,400 --> 02:09:23,750
doesn't really matter but the punch line
is that

6508
02:09:23,750 --> 02:09:23,760
is that
 

6509
02:09:23,760 --> 02:09:28,229
is that
she finds out that her creator

6510
02:09:28,229 --> 02:09:28,239
she finds out that her creator
 

6511
02:09:28,239 --> 02:09:31,510
she finds out that her creator
has made her

6512
02:09:31,510 --> 02:09:31,520
has made her
 

6513
02:09:31,520 --> 02:09:35,430
has made her
mortal and so the question

6514
02:09:35,430 --> 02:09:35,440
mortal and so the question
 

6515
02:09:35,440 --> 02:09:38,870
mortal and so the question
is what happens phenomenologically

6516
02:09:38,870 --> 02:09:38,880
is what happens phenomenologically
 

6517
02:09:38,880 --> 02:09:42,870
is what happens phenomenologically
and behaviorally to

6518
02:09:42,870 --> 02:09:42,880
and behaviorally to
 

6519
02:09:42,880 --> 02:09:46,470
and behaviorally to
an artificial intelligence

6520
02:09:46,470 --> 02:09:46,480
an artificial intelligence
 

6521
02:09:46,480 --> 02:09:49,669
an artificial intelligence
who now knows that it's

6522
02:09:49,669 --> 02:09:49,679
who now knows that it's
 

6523
02:09:49,679 --> 02:09:51,990
who now knows that it's
mortal and it's actually the same

6524
02:09:51,990 --> 02:09:52,000
mortal and it's actually the same
 

6525
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:53,030
mortal and it's actually the same
question

6526
02:09:53,030 --> 02:09:53,040
question
 

6527
02:09:53,040 --> 02:09:56,149
question
that you're posing yeah and that is is

6528
02:09:56,149 --> 02:09:56,159
that you're posing yeah and that is is
 

6529
02:09:56,159 --> 02:09:56,550
that you're posing yeah and that is is
that

6530
02:09:56,550 --> 02:09:56,560
that
 

6531
02:09:56,560 --> 02:10:00,950
that
necessary in order

6532
02:10:00,950 --> 02:10:00,960
necessary in order
 

6533
02:10:00,960 --> 02:10:05,270
necessary in order
for an ai to approximate humanity

6534
02:10:05,270 --> 02:10:05,280
for an ai to approximate humanity
 

6535
02:10:05,280 --> 02:10:07,589
for an ai to approximate humanity
yeah i think yeah so the intuition again

6536
02:10:07,589 --> 02:10:07,599
yeah i think yeah so the intuition again
 

6537
02:10:07,599 --> 02:10:09,270
yeah i think yeah so the intuition again
it's uh it's unknown but

6538
02:10:09,270 --> 02:10:09,280
it's uh it's unknown but
 

6539
02:10:09,280 --> 02:10:12,310
it's uh it's unknown but
i think it's absolutely i think it's

6540
02:10:12,310 --> 02:10:12,320
i think it's absolutely i think it's
 

6541
02:10:12,320 --> 02:10:13,589
i think it's absolutely i think it's
absolutely necessary

6542
02:10:13,589 --> 02:10:13,599
absolutely necessary
 

6543
02:10:13,599 --> 02:10:17,750
absolutely necessary
um a lot of people

6544
02:10:17,750 --> 02:10:17,760
um a lot of people
 

6545
02:10:17,760 --> 02:10:20,149
um a lot of people
this the same kind of shallow thinking

6546
02:10:20,149 --> 02:10:20,159
this the same kind of shallow thinking
 

6547
02:10:20,159 --> 02:10:21,830
this the same kind of shallow thinking
that people have about our own

6548
02:10:21,830 --> 02:10:21,840
that people have about our own
 

6549
02:10:21,840 --> 02:10:24,950
that people have about our own
end of life our own death is the same

6550
02:10:24,950 --> 02:10:24,960
end of life our own death is the same
 

6551
02:10:24,960 --> 02:10:25,990
end of life our own death is the same
way people think of

6552
02:10:25,990 --> 02:10:26,000
way people think of
 

6553
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,069
way people think of
i think about artificial intelligence

6554
02:10:28,069 --> 02:10:28,079
i think about artificial intelligence
 

6555
02:10:28,079 --> 02:10:30,550
i think about artificial intelligence
it's like well okay so yeah

6556
02:10:30,550 --> 02:10:30,560
it's like well okay so yeah
 

6557
02:10:30,560 --> 02:10:32,950
it's like well okay so yeah
so within the system there's a there's a

6558
02:10:32,950 --> 02:10:32,960
so within the system there's a there's a
 

6559
02:10:32,960 --> 02:10:34,550
so within the system there's a there's a
terminal position where like

6560
02:10:34,550 --> 02:10:34,560
terminal position where like
 

6561
02:10:34,560 --> 02:10:37,030
terminal position where like
there's there's a there's a point which

6562
02:10:37,030 --> 02:10:37,040
there's there's a there's a point which
 

6563
02:10:37,040 --> 02:10:37,589
there's there's a there's a point which
it ends

6564
02:10:37,589 --> 02:10:37,599
it ends
 

6565
02:10:37,599 --> 02:10:40,310
it ends
you just the program ends uh there's a

6566
02:10:40,310 --> 02:10:40,320
you just the program ends uh there's a
 

6567
02:10:40,320 --> 02:10:42,709
you just the program ends uh there's a
goal state there's a you reach the end

6568
02:10:42,709 --> 02:10:42,719
goal state there's a you reach the end
 

6569
02:10:42,719 --> 02:10:43,589
goal state there's a you reach the end
point

6570
02:10:43,589 --> 02:10:43,599
point
 

6571
02:10:43,599 --> 02:10:47,350
point
but the thing is uh

6572
02:10:47,350 --> 02:10:47,360
but the thing is uh
 

6573
02:10:47,360 --> 02:10:50,870
but the thing is uh
making that end a thing that's

6574
02:10:50,870 --> 02:10:50,880
making that end a thing that's
 

6575
02:10:50,880 --> 02:10:54,390
making that end a thing that's
also within the program like like the

6576
02:10:54,390 --> 02:10:54,400
also within the program like like the
 

6577
02:10:54,400 --> 02:10:56,950
also within the program like like the
making the thing like and then it's also

6578
02:10:56,950 --> 02:10:56,960
making the thing like and then it's also
 

6579
02:10:56,960 --> 02:10:58,470
making the thing like and then it's also
the mystery of it

6580
02:10:58,470 --> 02:10:58,480
the mystery of it
 

6581
02:10:58,480 --> 02:11:00,709
the mystery of it
so the thing is we don't know what the

6582
02:11:00,709 --> 02:11:00,719
so the thing is we don't know what the
 

6583
02:11:00,719 --> 02:11:02,950
so the thing is we don't know what the
hell this death thing is

6584
02:11:02,950 --> 02:11:02,960
hell this death thing is
 

6585
02:11:02,960 --> 02:11:06,709
hell this death thing is
i mean it's not like um it's not like we

6586
02:11:06,709 --> 02:11:06,719
i mean it's not like um it's not like we
 

6587
02:11:06,719 --> 02:11:09,350
i mean it's not like um it's not like we
i mean the program doesn't give us

6588
02:11:09,350 --> 02:11:09,360
i mean the program doesn't give us
 

6589
02:11:09,360 --> 02:11:11,430
i mean the program doesn't give us
information about the meaning of it all

6590
02:11:11,430 --> 02:11:11,440
information about the meaning of it all
 

6591
02:11:11,440 --> 02:11:13,830
information about the meaning of it all
exactly and the that's where the terror

6592
02:11:13,830 --> 02:11:13,840
exactly and the that's where the terror
 

6593
02:11:13,840 --> 02:11:14,709
exactly and the that's where the terror
is i

6594
02:11:14,709 --> 02:11:14,719
is i
 

6595
02:11:14,719 --> 02:11:17,750
is i
and and i it feels like i mean uh

6596
02:11:17,750 --> 02:11:17,760
and and i it feels like i mean uh
 

6597
02:11:17,760 --> 02:11:20,149
and and i it feels like i mean uh
in the language that you you would think

6598
02:11:20,149 --> 02:11:20,159
in the language that you you would think
 

6599
02:11:20,159 --> 02:11:20,790
in the language that you you would think
about is

6600
02:11:20,790 --> 02:11:20,800
about is
 

6601
02:11:20,800 --> 02:11:23,910
about is
um is the terror of this death or like

6602
02:11:23,910 --> 02:11:23,920
um is the terror of this death or like
 

6603
02:11:23,920 --> 02:11:25,669
um is the terror of this death or like
anticipation of it or thinking about it

6604
02:11:25,669 --> 02:11:25,679
anticipation of it or thinking about it
 

6605
02:11:25,679 --> 02:11:27,270
anticipation of it or thinking about it
is the creative force that builds

6606
02:11:27,270 --> 02:11:27,280
is the creative force that builds
 

6607
02:11:27,280 --> 02:11:27,750
is the creative force that builds
everything

6608
02:11:27,750 --> 02:11:27,760
everything
 

6609
02:11:27,760 --> 02:11:31,030
everything
right and that feels like uh

6610
02:11:31,030 --> 02:11:31,040
right and that feels like uh
 

6611
02:11:31,040 --> 02:11:34,149
right and that feels like uh
you know that feels really important to

6612
02:11:34,149 --> 02:11:34,159
you know that feels really important to
 

6613
02:11:34,159 --> 02:11:34,709
you know that feels really important to
implement

6614
02:11:34,709 --> 02:11:34,719
implement
 

6615
02:11:34,719 --> 02:11:37,589
implement
again very difficult to know how to do

6616
02:11:37,589 --> 02:11:37,599
again very difficult to know how to do
 

6617
02:11:37,599 --> 02:11:38,390
again very difficult to know how to do
technically

6618
02:11:38,390 --> 02:11:38,400
technically
 

6619
02:11:38,400 --> 02:11:40,229
technically
currently but it's important to think

6620
02:11:40,229 --> 02:11:40,239
currently but it's important to think
 

6621
02:11:40,239 --> 02:11:42,069
currently but it's important to think
about what i find is

6622
02:11:42,069 --> 02:11:42,079
about what i find is
 

6623
02:11:42,079 --> 02:11:44,550
about what i find is
you mentioned like screenplays and so on

6624
02:11:44,550 --> 02:11:44,560
you mentioned like screenplays and so on
 

6625
02:11:44,560 --> 02:11:46,629
you mentioned like screenplays and so on
is sci-fi folks and

6626
02:11:46,629 --> 02:11:46,639
is sci-fi folks and
 

6627
02:11:46,639 --> 02:11:49,669
is sci-fi folks and
uh philosophers are the the only ones

6628
02:11:49,669 --> 02:11:49,679
uh philosophers are the the only ones
 

6629
02:11:49,679 --> 02:11:51,030
uh philosophers are the the only ones
thinking about it currently

6630
02:11:51,030 --> 02:11:51,040
thinking about it currently
 

6631
02:11:51,040 --> 02:11:52,790
thinking about it currently
and that's what these folks have

6632
02:11:52,790 --> 02:11:52,800
and that's what these folks have
 

6633
02:11:52,800 --> 02:11:54,229
and that's what these folks have
convinced me yeah

6634
02:11:54,229 --> 02:11:54,239
convinced me yeah
 

6635
02:11:54,239 --> 02:11:57,830
convinced me yeah
and engineers aren't which is uh

6636
02:11:57,830 --> 02:11:57,840
and engineers aren't which is uh
 

6637
02:11:57,840 --> 02:12:01,589
and engineers aren't which is uh
i get yeah most of the most most of the

6638
02:12:01,589 --> 02:12:01,599
i get yeah most of the most most of the
 

6639
02:12:01,599 --> 02:12:04,149
i get yeah most of the most most of the
things i talk about i get kind of

6640
02:12:04,149 --> 02:12:04,159
things i talk about i get kind of
 

6641
02:12:04,159 --> 02:12:06,310
things i talk about i get kind of
um people roll their eyes from the

6642
02:12:06,310 --> 02:12:06,320
um people roll their eyes from the
 

6643
02:12:06,320 --> 02:12:08,470
um people roll their eyes from the
engineering person not these folks

6644
02:12:08,470 --> 02:12:08,480
engineering person not these folks
 

6645
02:12:08,480 --> 02:12:10,709
engineering person not these folks
that they're like because like again i

6646
02:12:10,709 --> 02:12:10,719
that they're like because like again i
 

6647
02:12:10,719 --> 02:12:11,830
that they're like because like again i
saw your name and they're like wait a

6648
02:12:11,830 --> 02:12:11,840
saw your name and they're like wait a
 

6649
02:12:11,840 --> 02:12:13,189
saw your name and they're like wait a
minute i've just seen that

6650
02:12:13,189 --> 02:12:13,199
minute i've just seen that
 

6651
02:12:13,199 --> 02:12:16,390
minute i've just seen that
they're like here's someone you should

6652
02:12:16,390 --> 02:12:16,400
they're like here's someone you should
 

6653
02:12:16,400 --> 02:12:17,350
they're like here's someone you should
check out

6654
02:12:17,350 --> 02:12:17,360
check out
 

6655
02:12:17,360 --> 02:12:20,550
check out
yeah so this was a delightful confluence

6656
02:12:20,550 --> 02:12:20,560
yeah so this was a delightful confluence
 

6657
02:12:20,560 --> 02:12:23,990
yeah so this was a delightful confluence
yeah i was a huge fan of um

6658
02:12:23,990 --> 02:12:24,000
yeah i was a huge fan of um
 

6659
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:27,430
yeah i was a huge fan of um
your work and ernest becker and um

6660
02:12:27,430 --> 02:12:27,440
your work and ernest becker and um
 

6661
02:12:27,440 --> 02:12:30,950
your work and ernest becker and um
it's funny that not enough people are uh

6662
02:12:30,950 --> 02:12:30,960
it's funny that not enough people are uh
 

6663
02:12:30,960 --> 02:12:32,709
it's funny that not enough people are uh
talking about it yeah i don't know what

6664
02:12:32,709 --> 02:12:32,719
talking about it yeah i don't know what
 

6665
02:12:32,719 --> 02:12:34,149
talking about it yeah i don't know what
to do with that i think

6666
02:12:34,149 --> 02:12:34,159
to do with that i think
 

6667
02:12:34,159 --> 02:12:36,390
to do with that i think
that there's a possibility to create

6668
02:12:36,390 --> 02:12:36,400
that there's a possibility to create
 

6669
02:12:36,400 --> 02:12:39,189
that there's a possibility to create
real deep meaningful connections between

6670
02:12:39,189 --> 02:12:39,199
real deep meaningful connections between
 

6671
02:12:39,199 --> 02:12:42,550
real deep meaningful connections between
ai systems and humans absolutely and um

6672
02:12:42,550 --> 02:12:42,560
ai systems and humans absolutely and um
 

6673
02:12:42,560 --> 02:12:44,229
ai systems and humans absolutely and um
i think some of these things the fear

6674
02:12:44,229 --> 02:12:44,239
i think some of these things the fear
 

6675
02:12:44,239 --> 02:12:46,149
i think some of these things the fear
mortality are essential

6676
02:12:46,149 --> 02:12:46,159
mortality are essential
 

6677
02:12:46,159 --> 02:12:48,229
mortality are essential
that are essential for the element of

6678
02:12:48,229 --> 02:12:48,239
that are essential for the element of
 

6679
02:12:48,239 --> 02:12:49,830
that are essential for the element of
human experience i don't

6680
02:12:49,830 --> 02:12:49,840
human experience i don't
 

6681
02:12:49,840 --> 02:12:51,910
human experience i don't
i don't think it might be essential to

6682
02:12:51,910 --> 02:12:51,920
i don't think it might be essential to
 

6683
02:12:51,920 --> 02:12:54,149
i don't think it might be essential to
create general intelligence like

6684
02:12:54,149 --> 02:12:54,159
create general intelligence like
 

6685
02:12:54,159 --> 02:12:57,109
create general intelligence like
very intelligent machines but to create

6686
02:12:57,109 --> 02:12:57,119
very intelligent machines but to create
 

6687
02:12:57,119 --> 02:12:59,189
very intelligent machines but to create
a machine that connects to a human in

6688
02:12:59,189 --> 02:12:59,199
a machine that connects to a human in
 

6689
02:12:59,199 --> 02:12:59,990
a machine that connects to a human in
some

6690
02:12:59,990 --> 02:13:00,000
some
 

6691
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:03,350
some
deep way what's your view

6692
02:13:03,350 --> 02:13:03,360
deep way what's your view
 

6693
02:13:03,360 --> 02:13:05,270
deep way what's your view
not to make me the interviewer but

6694
02:13:05,270 --> 02:13:05,280
not to make me the interviewer but
 

6695
02:13:05,280 --> 02:13:07,109
not to make me the interviewer but
what's your view about

6696
02:13:07,109 --> 02:13:07,119
what's your view about
 

6697
02:13:07,119 --> 02:13:10,149
what's your view about
um machine ethics

6698
02:13:10,149 --> 02:13:10,159
um machine ethics
 

6699
02:13:10,159 --> 02:13:13,270
um machine ethics
can you imagine an ethical ai

6700
02:13:13,270 --> 02:13:13,280
can you imagine an ethical ai
 

6701
02:13:13,280 --> 02:13:17,669
can you imagine an ethical ai
without some semblance of

6702
02:13:17,669 --> 02:13:17,679
without some semblance of
 

6703
02:13:17,679 --> 02:13:20,470
without some semblance of
yeah that's a finitude let's say well i

6704
02:13:20,470 --> 02:13:20,480
yeah that's a finitude let's say well i
 

6705
02:13:20,480 --> 02:13:21,589
yeah that's a finitude let's say well i
i think ethics

6706
02:13:21,589 --> 02:13:21,599
i think ethics
 

6707
02:13:21,599 --> 02:13:24,709
i think ethics
uh it's a

6708
02:13:24,709 --> 02:13:24,719
uh it's a
 

6709
02:13:24,719 --> 02:13:27,270
uh it's a
you know there's a there's a trolley

6710
02:13:27,270 --> 02:13:27,280
you know there's a there's a trolley
 

6711
02:13:27,280 --> 02:13:28,550
you know there's a there's a trolley
problem that's often used

6712
02:13:28,550 --> 02:13:28,560
problem that's often used
 

6713
02:13:28,560 --> 02:13:31,189
problem that's often used
in the work that i've done my team yeah

6714
02:13:31,189 --> 02:13:31,199
in the work that i've done my team yeah
 

6715
02:13:31,199 --> 02:13:33,030
in the work that i've done my team yeah
with uh with autonomous vehicles in

6716
02:13:33,030 --> 02:13:33,040
with uh with autonomous vehicles in
 

6717
02:13:33,040 --> 02:13:33,510
with uh with autonomous vehicles in
particular

6718
02:13:33,510 --> 02:13:33,520
particular
 

6719
02:13:33,520 --> 02:13:37,750
particular
oh yeah yeah uh that people

6720
02:13:37,750 --> 02:13:37,760
oh yeah yeah uh that people
 

6721
02:13:37,760 --> 02:13:40,709
oh yeah yeah uh that people
i think they offload they ask like how

6722
02:13:40,709 --> 02:13:40,719
i think they offload they ask like how
 

6723
02:13:40,719 --> 02:13:42,310
i think they offload they ask like how
would a machine deal with an ethical

6724
02:13:42,310 --> 02:13:42,320
would a machine deal with an ethical
 

6725
02:13:42,320 --> 02:13:43,589
would a machine deal with an ethical
situation

6726
02:13:43,589 --> 02:13:43,599
situation
 

6727
02:13:43,599 --> 02:13:46,629
situation
that they themselves humans don't know

6728
02:13:46,629 --> 02:13:46,639
that they themselves humans don't know
 

6729
02:13:46,639 --> 02:13:47,990
that they themselves humans don't know
how to deal exactly

6730
02:13:47,990 --> 02:13:48,000
how to deal exactly
 

6731
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:52,149
how to deal exactly
and so i don't know

6732
02:13:52,149 --> 02:13:52,159
and so i don't know
 

6733
02:13:52,159 --> 02:13:54,550
and so i don't know
if a machine is able to uh do a better

6734
02:13:54,550 --> 02:13:54,560
if a machine is able to uh do a better
 

6735
02:13:54,560 --> 02:13:55,669
if a machine is able to uh do a better
job on

6736
02:13:55,669 --> 02:13:55,679
job on
 

6737
02:13:55,679 --> 02:13:57,750
job on
difficult ethical questions but i

6738
02:13:57,750 --> 02:13:57,760
difficult ethical questions but i
 

6739
02:13:57,760 --> 02:13:59,109
difficult ethical questions but i
certainly think to behave

6740
02:13:59,109 --> 02:13:59,119
certainly think to behave
 

6741
02:13:59,119 --> 02:14:01,750
certainly think to behave
properly and effectively in this world

6742
02:14:01,750 --> 02:14:01,760
properly and effectively in this world
 

6743
02:14:01,760 --> 02:14:02,790
properly and effectively in this world
it needs to be

6744
02:14:02,790 --> 02:14:02,800
it needs to be
 

6745
02:14:02,800 --> 02:14:05,990
it needs to be
uh have a fear of mortality and like

6746
02:14:05,990 --> 02:14:06,000
uh have a fear of mortality and like
 

6747
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,870
uh have a fear of mortality and like
be able to even dance because i don't

6748
02:14:08,870 --> 02:14:08,880
be able to even dance because i don't
 

6749
02:14:08,880 --> 02:14:10,709
be able to even dance because i don't
think you can solve ethical problems but

6750
02:14:10,709 --> 02:14:10,719
think you can solve ethical problems but
 

6751
02:14:10,719 --> 02:14:12,310
think you can solve ethical problems but
you have to uh

6752
02:14:12,310 --> 02:14:12,320
you have to uh
 

6753
02:14:12,320 --> 02:14:14,149
you have to uh
i think like ethics is like a dance

6754
02:14:14,149 --> 02:14:14,159
i think like ethics is like a dance
 

6755
02:14:14,159 --> 02:14:15,589
i think like ethics is like a dance
floor you have to just

6756
02:14:15,589 --> 02:14:15,599
floor you have to just
 

6757
02:14:15,599 --> 02:14:17,990
floor you have to just
you have to uh dance properly with the

6758
02:14:17,990 --> 02:14:18,000
you have to uh dance properly with the
 

6759
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:19,510
you have to uh dance properly with the
rest of the humans like if people are

6760
02:14:19,510 --> 02:14:19,520
rest of the humans like if people are
 

6761
02:14:19,520 --> 02:14:21,189
rest of the humans like if people are
dancing tango you have to dance in the

6762
02:14:21,189 --> 02:14:21,199
dancing tango you have to dance in the
 

6763
02:14:21,199 --> 02:14:22,149
dancing tango you have to dance in the
same kind of way

6764
02:14:22,149 --> 02:14:22,159
same kind of way
 

6765
02:14:22,159 --> 02:14:24,950
same kind of way
and for that you have to have a fear of

6766
02:14:24,950 --> 02:14:24,960
and for that you have to have a fear of
 

6767
02:14:24,960 --> 02:14:25,990
and for that you have to have a fear of
mortality like i think

6768
02:14:25,990 --> 02:14:26,000
mortality like i think
 

6769
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,950
mortality like i think
of uh more practically speaking like i

6770
02:14:28,950 --> 02:14:28,960
of uh more practically speaking like i
 

6771
02:14:28,960 --> 02:14:30,550
of uh more practically speaking like i
said autonomous vehicles

6772
02:14:30,550 --> 02:14:30,560
said autonomous vehicles
 

6773
02:14:30,560 --> 02:14:31,830
said autonomous vehicles
like the way you interact with

6774
02:14:31,830 --> 02:14:31,840
like the way you interact with
 

6775
02:14:31,840 --> 02:14:33,830
like the way you interact with
pedestrians

6776
02:14:33,830 --> 02:14:33,840
pedestrians
 

6777
02:14:33,840 --> 02:14:36,390
pedestrians
fundamentally has to have a sense of

6778
02:14:36,390 --> 02:14:36,400
fundamentally has to have a sense of
 

6779
02:14:36,400 --> 02:14:37,750
fundamentally has to have a sense of
mortality

6780
02:14:37,750 --> 02:14:37,760
mortality
 

6781
02:14:37,760 --> 02:14:41,910
mortality
so uh when pedestrians crossed the road

6782
02:14:41,910 --> 02:14:41,920
so uh when pedestrians crossed the road
 

6783
02:14:41,920 --> 02:14:45,990
so uh when pedestrians crossed the road
and now i've watched

6784
02:14:45,990 --> 02:14:46,000

 

6785
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:47,669

well certainly 100 plus hours of

6786
02:14:47,669 --> 02:14:47,679
well certainly 100 plus hours of
 

6787
02:14:47,679 --> 02:14:50,470
well certainly 100 plus hours of
pedestrian videos

6788
02:14:50,470 --> 02:14:50,480
pedestrian videos
 

6789
02:14:50,480 --> 02:14:53,910
pedestrian videos
there's a kind of social uh contract

6790
02:14:53,910 --> 02:14:53,920
there's a kind of social uh contract
 

6791
02:14:53,920 --> 02:14:54,629
there's a kind of social uh contract
where

6792
02:14:54,629 --> 02:14:54,639
where
 

6793
02:14:54,639 --> 02:14:57,830
where
you walk in front of a car and

6794
02:14:57,830 --> 02:14:57,840
you walk in front of a car and
 

6795
02:14:57,840 --> 02:14:59,589
you walk in front of a car and
you're putting your life in the hands of

6796
02:14:59,589 --> 02:14:59,599
you're putting your life in the hands of
 

6797
02:14:59,599 --> 02:15:01,669
you're putting your life in the hands of
another human being that's right

6798
02:15:01,669 --> 02:15:01,679
another human being that's right
 

6799
02:15:01,679 --> 02:15:05,510
another human being that's right
and like death is is uh is in the car

6800
02:15:05,510 --> 02:15:05,520
and like death is is uh is in the car
 

6801
02:15:05,520 --> 02:15:07,350
and like death is is uh is in the car
in the game that's being played death is

6802
02:15:07,350 --> 02:15:07,360
in the game that's being played death is
 

6803
02:15:07,360 --> 02:15:08,550
in the game that's being played death is
right there

6804
02:15:08,550 --> 02:15:08,560
right there
 

6805
02:15:08,560 --> 02:15:10,950
right there
uh it's part of the calculus it's not

6806
02:15:10,950 --> 02:15:10,960
uh it's part of the calculus it's not
 

6807
02:15:10,960 --> 02:15:11,669
uh it's part of the calculus it's not
but it's not

6808
02:15:11,669 --> 02:15:11,679
but it's not
 

6809
02:15:11,679 --> 02:15:13,189
but it's not
like a simple calculator it's not a

6810
02:15:13,189 --> 02:15:13,199
like a simple calculator it's not a
 

6811
02:15:13,199 --> 02:15:15,750
like a simple calculator it's not a
simple equation it's uh

6812
02:15:15,750 --> 02:15:15,760
simple equation it's uh
 

6813
02:15:15,760 --> 02:15:18,069
simple equation it's uh
it's an s it's a i mean i don't know

6814
02:15:18,069 --> 02:15:18,079
it's an s it's a i mean i don't know
 

6815
02:15:18,079 --> 02:15:19,990
it's an s it's a i mean i don't know
what it is but it's it's in the it's in

6816
02:15:19,990 --> 02:15:20,000
what it is but it's it's in the it's in
 

6817
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:20,629
what it is but it's it's in the it's in
there

6818
02:15:20,629 --> 02:15:20,639
there
 

6819
02:15:20,639 --> 02:15:22,390
there
and uh it has to be part of the

6820
02:15:22,390 --> 02:15:22,400
and uh it has to be part of the
 

6821
02:15:22,400 --> 02:15:24,149
and uh it has to be part of the
optimization problem

6822
02:15:24,149 --> 02:15:24,159
optimization problem
 

6823
02:15:24,159 --> 02:15:26,310

computer vision from the
 

6827
02:15:27,760 --> 02:15:29,750
computer vision from the
artificial intelligence perspective it's

6828
02:15:29,750 --> 02:15:29,760
artificial intelligence perspective it's
 

6829
02:15:29,760 --> 02:15:31,510
artificial intelligence perspective it's
detecting there's a human

6830
02:15:31,510 --> 02:15:31,520
detecting there's a human
 

6831

i think requires having some sense

6854
02:15:55,589 --> 02:15:55,599
i think requires having some sense
 

6855
02:15:55,599 --> 02:15:59,189
i think requires having some sense
of yeah fear of fear of mortality of

6856
02:15:59,189 --> 02:15:59,199
of yeah fear of fear of mortality of
 

6857
02:15:59,199 --> 02:16:02,310
of yeah fear of fear of mortality of
mortality i don't see the thing is i

6858
02:16:02,310 --> 02:16:02,320
mortality i don't see the thing is i
 

6859
02:16:02,320 --> 02:16:03,430
mortality i don't see the thing is i
think it's really important to think

6860
02:16:03,430 --> 02:16:03,440
think it's really important to think
 

6861
02:16:03,440 --> 02:16:04,310
think it's really important to think
about

6862
02:16:04,310 --> 02:16:04,320
about
 

6863
02:16:04,320 --> 02:16:07,109
about
i i can be honest enough to say that

6864
02:16:07,109 --> 02:16:07,119
i i can be honest enough to say that
 

6865
02:16:07,119 --> 02:16:07,669
i i can be honest enough to say that
it's

6866
02:16:07,669 --> 02:16:07,679
it's
 

6867
02:16:07,679 --> 02:16:11,510
it's
i haven't been able to figure out

6868
02:16:11,510 --> 02:16:11,520
i haven't been able to figure out
 

6869
02:16:11,520 --> 02:16:13,430
i haven't been able to figure out
how to engineer any of these things

6870
02:16:13,430 --> 02:16:13,440
how to engineer any of these things
 

6871
02:16:13,440 --> 02:16:15,510
how to engineer any of these things
right uh but i do think it's really

6872
02:16:15,510 --> 02:16:15,520
right uh but i do think it's really
 

6873
02:16:15,520 --> 02:16:17,589
right uh but i do think it's really
really important like i have uh so i

6874
02:16:17,589 --> 02:16:17,599
really important like i have uh so i
 

6875
02:16:17,599 --> 02:16:19,189
really important like i have uh so i
have a bunch of roombas here

6876
02:16:19,189 --> 02:16:19,199
have a bunch of roombas here
 

6877
02:16:19,199 --> 02:16:21,910
have a bunch of roombas here
i can show it to you after uh that i

6878
02:16:21,910 --> 02:16:21,920
i can show it to you after uh that i
 

6879
02:16:21,920 --> 02:16:22,629
i can show it to you after uh that i
have

6880
02:16:22,629 --> 02:16:22,639
have
 

6881
02:16:22,639 --> 02:16:25,830
have
roombas as a robot that has um

6882
02:16:25,830 --> 02:16:25,840
roombas as a robot that has um
 

6883
02:16:25,840 --> 02:16:29,589
roombas as a robot that has um
vacuums the floor and i've had them um

6884
02:16:29,589 --> 02:16:29,599
vacuums the floor and i've had them um
 

6885
02:16:29,599 --> 02:16:31,589
vacuums the floor and i've had them um
make different sounds like i had them

6886
02:16:31,589 --> 02:16:31,599
make different sounds like i had them
 

6887
02:16:31,599 --> 02:16:33,349
make different sounds like i had them
scream in pain

6888
02:16:33,349 --> 02:16:33,359
scream in pain
 

6889
02:16:33,359 --> 02:16:37,110
scream in pain
and it it

6890
02:16:37,110 --> 02:16:37,120

 

6891
02:16:37,120 --> 02:16:40,709

it you immediately anthropomorphized

6892
02:16:40,709 --> 02:16:40,719
it you immediately anthropomorphized
 

6893
02:16:40,719 --> 02:16:44,389
it you immediately anthropomorphized
absolutely and it creates uh

6894
02:16:44,389 --> 02:16:44,399
absolutely and it creates uh
 

6895
02:16:44,399 --> 02:16:46,549
absolutely and it creates uh
i don't know knowing that they can feel

6896
02:16:46,549 --> 02:16:46,559
i don't know knowing that they can feel
 

6897
02:16:46,559 --> 02:16:47,589
i don't know knowing that they can feel
pain but

6898
02:16:47,589 --> 02:16:47,599
pain but
 

6899
02:16:47,599 --> 02:16:50,950
pain but
see i'm i'm speaking like knowing uh

6900
02:16:50,950 --> 02:16:50,960
see i'm i'm speaking like knowing uh
 

6901
02:16:50,960 --> 02:16:52,629
see i'm i'm speaking like knowing uh
that i immediately imagine that they can

6902
02:16:52,629 --> 02:16:52,639
that i immediately imagine that they can
 

6903
02:16:52,639 --> 02:16:54,309
that i immediately imagine that they can
feel pain and it means

6904
02:16:54,309 --> 02:16:54,319
feel pain and it means
 

6905
02:16:54,319 --> 02:16:56,309
feel pain and it means
it immediately draws me closer to them

6906
02:16:56,309 --> 02:16:56,319
it immediately draws me closer to them
 

6907
02:16:56,319 --> 02:16:58,870
it immediately draws me closer to them
yes at the human experience and

6908
02:16:58,870 --> 02:16:58,880
yes at the human experience and
 

6909
02:16:58,880 --> 02:17:00,469
yes at the human experience and
that there's there's something in that

6910
02:17:00,469 --> 02:17:00,479
that there's there's something in that
 

6911
02:17:00,479 --> 02:17:02,790
that there's there's something in that
that should be engineered in our

6912
02:17:02,790 --> 02:17:02,800
that should be engineered in our
 

6913
02:17:02,800 --> 02:17:05,910
that should be engineered in our
in our systems it feels like i

6914
02:17:05,910 --> 02:17:05,920
in our systems it feels like i
 

6915
02:17:05,920 --> 02:17:07,190
in our systems it feels like i
i believe personally i don't know what

6916
02:17:07,190 --> 02:17:07,200
i believe personally i don't know what
 

6917
02:17:07,200 --> 02:17:09,190
i believe personally i don't know what
you think but uh

6918
02:17:09,190 --> 02:17:09,200
you think but uh
 

6919
02:17:09,200 --> 02:17:11,509
you think but uh
i believe it's possible for a robot and

6920
02:17:11,509 --> 02:17:11,519
i believe it's possible for a robot and
 

6921
02:17:11,519 --> 02:17:13,589
i believe it's possible for a robot and
a human to fall in love for example in

6922
02:17:13,589 --> 02:17:13,599
a human to fall in love for example in
 

6923
02:17:13,599 --> 02:17:14,549
a human to fall in love for example in
the in the future

6924
02:17:14,549 --> 02:17:14,559
the in the future
 

6925
02:17:14,559 --> 02:17:18,790
the in the future
oh i think it's yeah it's already there

6926
02:17:18,790 --> 02:17:18,800
oh i think it's yeah it's already there
 

6927
02:17:18,800 --> 02:17:20,790
oh i think it's yeah it's already there
no there's a certain kind of deep

6928
02:17:20,790 --> 02:17:20,800
no there's a certain kind of deep
 

6929
02:17:20,800 --> 02:17:22,230
no there's a certain kind of deep
connection with technology yeah

6930
02:17:22,230 --> 02:17:22,240
connection with technology yeah
 

6931
02:17:22,240 --> 02:17:25,110
connection with technology yeah
in a real like you would choose to marry

6932
02:17:25,110 --> 02:17:25,120
in a real like you would choose to marry
 

6933
02:17:25,120 --> 02:17:26,389
in a real like you would choose to marry
um

6934
02:17:26,389 --> 02:17:26,399
um
 

6935
02:17:26,399 --> 02:17:29,429
um
i mean again it sounds uh

6936
02:17:29,429 --> 02:17:29,439
i mean again it sounds uh
 

6937
02:17:29,439 --> 02:17:31,270
i mean again it sounds uh
i'll find a book title and i'll send it

6938
02:17:31,270 --> 02:17:31,280
i'll find a book title and i'll send it
 

6939
02:17:31,280 --> 02:17:33,870
i'll find a book title and i'll send it
to you and it's a serious

6940
02:17:33,870 --> 02:17:33,880
to you and it's a serious
 

6941
02:17:33,880 --> 02:17:36,870
to you and it's a serious
consideration of people

6942
02:17:36,870 --> 02:17:36,880
consideration of people
 

6943
02:17:36,880 --> 02:17:42,309
consideration of people
who started out with these sex dolls

6944
02:17:42,309 --> 02:17:42,319
who started out with these sex dolls
 

6945
02:17:42,319 --> 02:17:45,509
who started out with these sex dolls
but it turned into a relationship of

6946
02:17:45,509 --> 02:17:45,519
but it turned into a relationship of
 

6947
02:17:45,519 --> 02:17:46,309
but it turned into a relationship of
enduring

6948
02:17:46,309 --> 02:17:46,319
enduring
 

6949
02:17:46,319 --> 02:17:48,230
enduring
significance that the woman who wrote

6950
02:17:48,230 --> 02:17:48,240
significance that the woman who wrote
 

6951
02:17:48,240 --> 02:17:49,509
significance that the woman who wrote
the book is not

6952
02:17:49,509 --> 02:17:49,519
the book is not
 

6953
02:17:49,519 --> 02:17:52,709
the book is not
willing to dismiss as a perversion yeah

6954
02:17:52,709 --> 02:17:52,719
willing to dismiss as a perversion yeah
 

6955
02:17:52,719 --> 02:17:54,309
willing to dismiss as a perversion yeah
that's what uh

6956
02:17:54,309 --> 02:17:54,319
that's what uh
 

6957
02:17:54,319 --> 02:17:55,990
that's what uh
you know people kind of joke about sex

6958
02:17:55,990 --> 02:17:56,000
you know people kind of joke about sex
 

6959
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:57,589
you know people kind of joke about sex
robots which is funny

6960
02:17:57,589 --> 02:17:57,599
robots which is funny
 

6961
02:17:57,599 --> 02:17:59,910
robots which is funny
uh like it's a it's a funny i mean

6962
02:17:59,910 --> 02:17:59,920
uh like it's a it's a funny i mean
 

6963
02:17:59,920 --> 02:18:01,429
uh like it's a it's a funny i mean
there's a lot of stuff about robots it's

6964
02:18:01,429 --> 02:18:01,439
there's a lot of stuff about robots it's
 

6965
02:18:01,439 --> 02:18:03,589
there's a lot of stuff about robots it's
just kind of fun to talk about that

6966
02:18:03,589 --> 02:18:03,599
just kind of fun to talk about that
 

6967
02:18:03,599 --> 02:18:05,509
just kind of fun to talk about that
is it's not necessarily connected to

6968
02:18:05,509 --> 02:18:05,519
is it's not necessarily connected to
 

6969
02:18:05,519 --> 02:18:06,709
is it's not necessarily connected to
reality

6970
02:18:06,709 --> 02:18:06,719
reality
 

6971
02:18:06,719 --> 02:18:08,709
reality
uh people joke about sex robots but if

6972
02:18:08,709 --> 02:18:08,719
uh people joke about sex robots but if
 

6973
02:18:08,719 --> 02:18:10,790
uh people joke about sex robots but if
you actually look how sex robots which

6974
02:18:10,790 --> 02:18:10,800
you actually look how sex robots which
 

6975
02:18:10,800 --> 02:18:11,830
you actually look how sex robots which
are pretty rare

6976
02:18:11,830 --> 02:18:11,840
are pretty rare
 

6977
02:18:11,840 --> 02:18:14,950
are pretty rare
these days are used they're not

6978
02:18:14,950 --> 02:18:14,960
these days are used they're not
 

6979
02:18:14,960 --> 02:18:18,070
these days are used they're not
used by people who want sex

6980
02:18:18,070 --> 02:18:18,080

7626
02:31:02,790 --> 02:31:02,800
experience oh i think
 

7627
02:31:02,800 --> 02:31:04,790
experience oh i think
we're quite far away from that but yeah

7628
02:31:04,790 --> 02:31:04,800
we're quite far away from that but yeah
 

7629
02:31:04,800 --> 02:31:06,870
we're quite far away from that but yeah
it might be able my hope is

7630
02:31:06,870 --> 02:31:06,880
it might be able my hope is
 

7631
02:31:06,880 --> 02:31:10,150
it might be able my hope is
i'm you know i'm i'm hopeful i was at

7632
02:31:10,150 --> 02:31:10,160
i'm you know i'm i'm hopeful i was at
 

7633
02:31:10,160 --> 02:31:11,670
i'm you know i'm i'm hopeful i was at
microsoft

7634
02:31:11,670 --> 02:31:11,680
microsoft
 

7635
02:31:11,680 --> 02:31:14,790
microsoft
in seattle and i can't remember why

7636
02:31:14,790 --> 02:31:14,800
in seattle and i can't remember why
 

7637
02:31:14,800 --> 02:31:17,910
in seattle and i can't remember why
and no i i can't i i

7638
02:31:17,910 --> 02:31:17,920
and no i i can't i i
 

7639
02:31:17,920 --> 02:31:20,950
and no i i can't i i
that's how i'm in my early mr magoo

7640
02:31:20,950 --> 02:31:20,960
that's how i'm in my early mr magoo
 

7641
02:31:20,960 --> 02:31:25,510
that's how i'm in my early mr magoo
phase and and somebody there was showing

7642
02:31:25,510 --> 02:31:25,520
phase and and somebody there was showing
 

7643
02:31:25,520 --> 02:31:26,870
phase and and somebody there was showing
us

7644
02:31:26,870 --> 02:31:26,880
us
 

7645
02:31:26,880 --> 02:31:30,070
us
like a virtual wall where the entire

7646
02:31:30,070 --> 02:31:30,080
like a virtual wall where the entire
 

7647
02:31:30,080 --> 02:31:31,590
like a virtual wall where the entire
wall

7648
02:31:31,590 --> 02:31:31,600
wall
 

7649
02:31:31,600 --> 02:31:33,910
wall
you know when you're talking to somebody

7650
02:31:33,910 --> 02:31:33,920
you know when you're talking to somebody
 

7651
02:31:33,920 --> 02:31:35,349
you know when you're talking to somebody
so it's life-size

7652
02:31:35,349 --> 02:31:35,359
so it's life-size
 

7653
02:31:35,359 --> 02:31:39,270
so it's life-size
and they were beginning the

7654
02:31:39,270 --> 02:31:39,280
and they were beginning the
 

7655
02:31:39,280 --> 02:31:41,750
and they were beginning the
get the appearance of motion and stuff

7656
02:31:41,750 --> 02:31:41,760
get the appearance of motion and stuff
 

7657
02:31:41,760 --> 02:31:43,349
get the appearance of motion and stuff
it looked pretty

7658
02:31:43,349 --> 02:31:43,359
it looked pretty
 

7659
02:31:43,359 --> 02:31:44,950
it looked pretty
yeah with virtual reality too i don't

7660
02:31:44,950 --> 02:31:44,960
yeah with virtual reality too i don't
 

7661
02:31:44,960 --> 02:31:46,070
yeah with virtual reality too i don't
know if you've ever been inside a

7662
02:31:46,070 --> 02:31:46,080
know if you've ever been inside a
 

7663
02:31:46,080 --> 02:31:47,030
know if you've ever been inside a
virtual world

7664
02:31:47,030 --> 02:31:47,040
virtual world
 

7665
02:31:47,040 --> 02:31:50,230
virtual world
yeah it's to me it's uh i can just

7666
02:31:50,230 --> 02:31:50,240
yeah it's to me it's uh i can just
 

7667
02:31:50,240 --> 02:31:53,349
yeah it's to me it's uh i can just
i can see the future it's uh it's it's

7668
02:31:53,349 --> 02:31:53,359
i can see the future it's uh it's it's
 

7669
02:31:53,359 --> 02:31:56,150
i can see the future it's uh it's it's
quite real yeah in terms of like a

7670
02:31:56,150 --> 02:31:56,160
quite real yeah in terms of like a
 

7671
02:31:56,160 --> 02:31:57,110
quite real yeah in terms of like a
terror of death

7672
02:31:57,110 --> 02:31:57,120
terror of death
 

7673
02:31:57,120 --> 02:32:00,550
terror of death
uh i'm afraid of heights me too

7674
02:32:00,550 --> 02:32:00,560
uh i'm afraid of heights me too
 

7675
02:32:00,560 --> 02:32:02,070
uh i'm afraid of heights me too
and there's i don't know if you've ever

7676
02:32:02,070 --> 02:32:02,080
and there's i don't know if you've ever
 

7677
02:32:02,080 --> 02:32:03,670
and there's i don't know if you've ever
tried uh you should

7678
02:32:03,670 --> 02:32:03,680
tried uh you should
 

7679
02:32:03,680 --> 02:32:05,429
tried uh you should
if you haven't there's a virtual reality

7680
02:32:05,429 --> 02:32:05,439
if you haven't there's a virtual reality
 

7681
02:32:05,439 --> 02:32:06,950
if you haven't there's a virtual reality
experience where you can walk a plank

7682
02:32:06,950 --> 02:32:06,960
experience where you can walk a plank
 

7683
02:32:06,960 --> 02:32:07,590
experience where you can walk a plank
yeah

7684
02:32:07,590 --> 02:32:07,600
yeah
 

7685
02:32:07,600 --> 02:32:10,070
yeah
you can look down and oh man i was on

7686
02:32:10,070 --> 02:32:10,080
you can look down and oh man i was on
 

7687
02:32:10,080 --> 02:32:10,950
you can look down and oh man i was on
the ground

7688
02:32:10,950 --> 02:32:10,960
the ground
 

7689
02:32:10,960 --> 02:32:14,630
the ground
like i was like i was afraid i was

7690
02:32:14,630 --> 02:32:14,640
like i was like i was afraid i was
 

7691
02:32:14,640 --> 02:32:15,990
like i was like i was afraid i was
deeply afraid i was

7692
02:32:15,990 --> 02:32:16,000
deeply afraid i was
 

7693
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:19,190
deeply afraid i was
is it was it was as real as

7694
02:32:19,190 --> 02:32:19,200
is it was it was as real as
 

7695
02:32:19,200 --> 02:32:21,750
is it was it was as real as
uh yep as anything else could be in i

7696
02:32:21,750 --> 02:32:21,760
uh yep as anything else could be in i
 

7697
02:32:21,760 --> 02:32:23,429
uh yep as anything else could be in i
mean these are very early days of that

7698
02:32:23,429 --> 02:32:23,439
mean these are very early days of that
 

7699
02:32:23,439 --> 02:32:24,630
mean these are very early days of that
technology

7700
02:32:24,630 --> 02:32:24,640
technology
 

7701
02:32:24,640 --> 02:32:28,230
technology
relatively speaking so um

7702
02:32:28,230 --> 02:32:28,240
relatively speaking so um
 

7703
02:32:28,240 --> 02:32:30,070
relatively speaking so um
yeah i mean i don't know what to do with

7704
02:32:30,070 --> 02:32:30,080
yeah i mean i don't know what to do with
 

7705
02:32:30,080 --> 02:32:31,750
yeah i mean i don't know what to do with
that same with like crossing the street

7706
02:32:31,750 --> 02:32:31,760
that same with like crossing the street
 

7707
02:32:31,760 --> 02:32:34,309
that same with like crossing the street
we did these experiments

7708
02:32:34,309 --> 02:32:34,319
we did these experiments
 

7709
02:32:34,319 --> 02:32:37,030
we did these experiments
across the street in front of a car and

7710
02:32:37,030 --> 02:32:37,040
across the street in front of a car and
 

7711
02:32:37,040 --> 02:32:39,349
across the street in front of a car and
uh you know it's being run over

7712
02:32:39,349 --> 02:32:39,359
uh you know it's being run over
 

7713
02:32:39,359 --> 02:32:42,469
uh you know it's being run over
by a car uh it's terrifying

7714
02:32:42,469 --> 02:32:42,479
by a car uh it's terrifying
 

7715
02:32:42,479 --> 02:32:45,990
by a car uh it's terrifying
yeah it's just that uh yeah so

7716
02:32:45,990 --> 02:32:46,000
yeah it's just that uh yeah so
 

7717
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:48,550
yeah it's just that uh yeah so
there is a rich experience to be created

7718
02:32:48,550 --> 02:32:48,560
there is a rich experience to be created
 

7719
02:32:48,560 --> 02:32:49,990
there is a rich experience to be created
there we're not there yet

7720
02:32:49,990 --> 02:32:50,000
there we're not there yet
 

7721
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:53,510
there we're not there yet
but uh uh i yeah and i've seen a lot of

7722
02:32:53,510 --> 02:32:53,520
but uh uh i yeah and i've seen a lot of
 

7723
02:32:53,520 --> 02:32:55,030
but uh uh i yeah and i've seen a lot of
people try like you said the google

7724
02:32:55,030 --> 02:32:55,040
people try like you said the google
 

7725
02:32:55,040 --> 02:32:55,510
people try like you said the google
folks

7726
02:32:55,510 --> 02:32:55,520
folks
 

7727
02:32:55,520 --> 02:32:58,070
folks
uh uh silicon valley folks try to create

7728
02:32:58,070 --> 02:32:58,080
uh uh silicon valley folks try to create
 

7729
02:32:58,080 --> 02:32:59,110
uh uh silicon valley folks try to create
a virtual

7730
02:32:59,110 --> 02:32:59,120
a virtual
 

7731
02:32:59,120 --> 02:33:01,750
a virtual
online education i don't know i think

7732
02:33:01,750 --> 02:33:01,760
online education i don't know i think
 

7733
02:33:01,760 --> 02:33:02,630
online education i don't know i think
they've raised

7734
02:33:02,630 --> 02:33:02,640
they've raised
 

7735
02:33:02,640 --> 02:33:04,830
they've raised
really important questions absolutely

7736
02:33:04,830 --> 02:33:04,840
really important questions absolutely
 

7737
02:33:04,840 --> 02:33:06,710
really important questions absolutely
what makes

7738
02:33:06,710 --> 02:33:06,720
what makes
 

7739
02:33:06,720 --> 02:33:10,150
what makes
uh the education experience

7740
02:33:10,150 --> 02:33:10,160
uh the education experience
 

7741
02:33:10,160 --> 02:33:13,190
uh the education experience
fulfilling what makes it effective yeah

7742
02:33:13,190 --> 02:33:13,200
fulfilling what makes it effective yeah
 

7743
02:33:13,200 --> 02:33:15,030
fulfilling what makes it effective yeah
these are important questions and i

7744
02:33:15,030 --> 02:33:15,040
these are important questions and i
 

7745
02:33:15,040 --> 02:33:16,710
these are important questions and i
think what they highlight is we have no

7746
02:33:16,710 --> 02:33:16,720
think what they highlight is we have no
 

7747
02:33:16,720 --> 02:33:18,790
think what they highlight is we have no
clue

7748
02:33:18,790 --> 02:33:18,800
clue
 

7749
02:33:18,800 --> 02:33:22,389
clue
like uh there's a

7750
02:33:22,389 --> 02:33:22,399

 

7751
02:33:22,399 --> 02:33:26,389

8647
02:52:31,120 --> 02:52:33,830
parents my dad worked two full-time jobs
um when i was growing up and i would see

8648
02:52:33,830 --> 02:52:33,840
um when i was growing up and i would see
 

8649
02:52:33,840 --> 02:52:35,429
um when i was growing up and i would see
him on the weekends i'd be like why are

8650
02:52:35,429 --> 02:52:35,439
him on the weekends i'd be like why are
 

8651
02:52:35,439 --> 02:52:36,710
him on the weekends i'd be like why are
you working all the time

8652
02:52:36,710 --> 02:52:36,720

and so your first responsibility is to
take care of yourself

8662

take care of yourself
 

8663
02:52:50,160 --> 02:52:53,830
take care of yourself
and then your next responsibility is

8664
02:52:53,830 --> 02:52:53,840
and then your next responsibility is
 

8665
02:52:53,840 --> 02:52:58,070
and then your next responsibility is
to take care of other people and um

8666
02:52:58,070 --> 02:52:58,080
to take care of other people and um
 

8667
02:52:58,080 --> 02:52:59,590
to take care of other people and um
i think you did a pretty good job of

8668
02:52:59,590 --> 02:52:59,600
i think you did a pretty good job of
 

8669
02:52:59,600 --> 02:53:01,429
i think you did a pretty good job of
that well i don't know but i

8670
02:53:01,429 --> 02:53:01,439
that well i don't know but i
 

8671
02:53:01,439 --> 02:53:05,110
that well i don't know but i
i i so those are the things that

8672
02:53:05,110 --> 02:53:05,120
i i so those are the things that
 

8673
02:53:05,120 --> 02:53:08,389
i i so those are the things that
i'm proud of

8674

i'm proud of
 

8675
02:53:08,399 --> 02:53:11,429
i'm proud of
was it's funny you've been if you've

8676
02:53:11,429 --> 02:53:11,439
was it's funny you've been if you've

02:53:28,240 --> 02:53:29,750
kind of integrating and maybe even
popularizing the work of

8690
02:53:29,750 --> 02:53:29,760
popularizing the work of
 

8691
02:53:29,760 --> 02:53:32,630
popularizing the work of
ernest becker of connecting it uh of

8692
02:53:32,630 --> 02:53:32,640
ernest becker of connecting it uh of
 

8693
02:53:32,640 --> 02:53:34,469
ernest becker of connecting it uh of
making it legitimate scientifically i

8694
02:53:34,469 --> 02:53:34,479
making it legitimate scientifically i
 

8695
02:53:34,479 --> 02:53:37,190
making it legitimate scientifically i
mean

8696
02:53:37,190 --> 02:53:37,200

 

8697
02:53:37,200 --> 02:53:38,790

you know as a human of course you want

8698
02:53:38,790 --> 02:53:38,800
you know as a human of course you want
 

8699
02:53:38,800 --> 02:53:40,469

contributed in terms of
 

8713
02:53:53,120 --> 02:53:55,349
contributed in terms of
how we think about the human condition

8714
02:53:55,349 --> 02:53:55,359
how we think about the human condition
 

8715
02:53:55,359 --> 02:53:56,870
how we think about the human condition
how we think about

8716
02:53:56,870 --> 02:53:56,880
how we think about
 

8717
02:53:56,880 --> 02:54:00,389
how we think about
ourselves assuming as finite beings in

8718
02:54:00,389 --> 02:54:00,399
ourselves assuming as finite beings in
 

8719
02:54:00,399 --> 02:54:01,269
ourselves assuming as finite beings in
this world

8720
02:54:01,269 --> 02:54:01,279
this world
 

8721
02:54:01,279 --> 02:54:03,670
this world
and i hope also in our technology of

8722
02:54:03,670 --> 02:54:03,680
and i hope also in our technology of
 

8723
02:54:03,680 --> 02:54:05,590
and i hope also in our technology of
engineering intelligence

8724
02:54:05,590 --> 02:54:05,600
engineering intelligence
 

8725
02:54:05,600 --> 02:54:08,790
engineering intelligence
i think at least at least for me and i'm

8726
02:54:08,790 --> 02:54:08,800
i think at least at least for me and i'm

that and
 

8737
02:54:17,920 --> 02:54:20,230
that and
we have described ourselves as giant

8738
02:54:20,230 --> 02:54:20,240
we have described ourselves as giant
 

8739
02:54:20,240 --> 02:54:21,670
we have described ourselves as giant
interneurons

8740
02:54:21,670 --> 02:54:21,680
interneurons
 

8741
02:54:21,680 --> 02:54:25,990
interneurons
unlike we have had no original ideas and

8742
02:54:25,990 --> 02:54:26,000
unlike we have had no original ideas and
 

8743
02:54:26,000 --> 02:54:28,309
unlike we have had no original ideas and
and maybe that's the only thing that's

8744
02:54:28,309 --> 02:54:28,319
and maybe that's the only thing that's
 

8745
02:54:28,319 --> 02:54:29,990
and maybe that's the only thing that's
original about our work is we don't

8746
02:54:29,990 --> 02:54:30,000
original about our work is we don't
