00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,170
reference it as one of the biggest
mistakes in terms of competitive trust

162
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:54,180
mistakes in terms of competitive trust
 

163
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,449
mistakes in terms of competitive trust
that I made is specifically because it

164
00:02:56,449 --> 00:02:56,459
that I made is specifically because it
 

165
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:58,430
that I made is specifically because it
gave Magnus a chance to understand my

166
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:58,440
gave Magnus a chance to understand my
 

167
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,130
gave Magnus a chance to understand my
style of Chess and at the time I

168
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:01,140
style of Chess and at the time I
 

169
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,869
style of Chess and at the time I
actually had pretty good results against

170
00:03:02,869 --> 00:03:02,879
actually had pretty good results against
 

171
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,850
actually had pretty good results against
Magnus I think maybe he was up one or

172
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:04,860
Magnus I think maybe he was up one or
 

173
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,410
Magnus I think maybe he was up one or
two games but there were many games

174
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:06,420
two games but there were many games
 

175
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,030
two games but there were many games
where I'd been pressing close to winning

176
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:08,040
where I'd been pressing close to winning
 

177
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,490
where I'd been pressing close to winning
against him prior to that match and so

178
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:10,500
against him prior to that match and so
 

179
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,869
against him prior to that match and so
when I went and played that match there

180
00:03:11,869 --> 00:03:11,879
when I went and played that match there
 

181
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:12,890
when I went and played that match there
were a few things that happened first of

182
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:12,900
were a few things that happened first of
 

183
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,449
were a few things that happened first of
all Magnus really started to understand

184
00:03:14,449 --> 00:03:14,459
all Magnus really started to understand
 

185
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:17,210
all Magnus really started to understand
my style because we played all sorts of

186
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:17,220
my style because we played all sorts of
 

187
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,190
my style because we played all sorts of
different openings and so I think he

188
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:19,200
different openings and so I think he
 

189
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,530
different openings and so I think he
understood that at times I wasn't so

190
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:21,540
understood that at times I wasn't so
 

191
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,089
understood that at times I wasn't so
great in the opening and there were many

192
00:03:23,089 --> 00:03:23,099
great in the opening and there were many
 

193
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:25,070
great in the opening and there were many
openings where I would play slightly

194
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:25,080
openings where I would play slightly
 

195
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,990
openings where I would play slightly
dubious variations as opposed to the

196
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:27,000
dubious variations as opposed to the
 

197
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,110
dubious variations as opposed to the
main lines and then secondly from my

198
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:30,120
main lines and then secondly from my
 

199
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,030
main lines and then secondly from my
standpoint the problem that I realized

200
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:32,040
standpoint the problem that I realized
 

201
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,350
standpoint the problem that I realized
since we were playing with an increment

202
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:33,360
since we were playing with an increment
 

203
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,790
since we were playing with an increment
there were many games where I was close

204
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:34,800
there were many games where I was close
 

205
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,610
there were many games where I was close
to winning and he would defend end games

206
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:36,620
to winning and he would defend end games
 

207
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,470
to winning and he would defend end games
amazingly well he would defend what our

208
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:39,480
amazingly well he would defend what our
 

209
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,149
amazingly well he would defend what our
technical technically drawn end games

210
00:03:41,149 --> 00:03:41,159
technical technically drawn end games
 

211
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:42,770
technical technically drawn end games
but where I would have like an extra

212
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:42,780
but where I would have like an extra
 

213
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,330
but where I would have like an extra
pawn it would be like rook and Bishop

214
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:44,340
pawn it would be like rook and Bishop
 

215
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,949
pawn it would be like rook and Bishop
versus rook and Knight say I have four

216
00:03:45,949 --> 00:03:45,959
versus rook and Knight say I have four
 

217
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,630
versus rook and Knight say I have four
pawns he has three pawns end games of

218
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:47,640
pawns he has three pawns end games of
 

219
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:51,110
pawns he has three pawns end games of
this nature now if you aren't super into

220
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:51,120
this nature now if you aren't super into
 

221
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,330
this nature now if you aren't super into
chess you might not understand what I'm

222
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:53,340
chess you might not understand what I'm
 

223
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,770
chess you might not understand what I'm
referring to if you are you will but

224
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:54,780
referring to if you are you will but
 

225
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,030
referring to if you are you will but
their end games where one side might

226
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:56,040
their end games where one side might
 

227
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,710
their end games where one side might
have extra material and extra Pawn say

228
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:57,720
have extra material and extra Pawn say
 

229
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,509
have extra material and extra Pawn say
extra two pawns but theoretically it's a

230
00:03:59,509 --> 00:03:59,519
extra two pawns but theoretically it's a
 

231
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,009
extra two pawns but theoretically it's a
drawn so can you give an example of the

232
00:04:01,009 --> 00:04:01,019
drawn so can you give an example of the
 

233
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:02,390
drawn so can you give an example of the
set of pieces we're talking about five

234
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:02,400
set of pieces we're talking about five
 

235
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,789
set of pieces we're talking about five
six seven pieces like so okay like a

236
00:04:04,789 --> 00:04:04,799
six seven pieces like so okay like a
 

237
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,229
six seven pieces like so okay like a
very basic one would be rook in four

238
00:04:06,229 --> 00:04:06,239
very basic one would be rook in four
 

239
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,850
very basic one would be rook in four
pawns against rook and three pawns so

240
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:07,860
pawns against rook and three pawns so
 

241
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,530
pawns against rook and three pawns so
that would be nine total pieces on the

242
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:09,540
that would be nine total pieces on the
 

243
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,110
that would be nine total pieces on the
board four pawns on one side three pawns

244
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:12,120
board four pawns on one side three pawns
 

245
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,750
board four pawns on one side three pawns
on the other side wide but it's on the

246
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:14,760
on the other side wide but it's on the
 

247
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,370
on the other side wide but it's on the
same side of the board now this is a

248
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:16,380
same side of the board now this is a
 

249
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,990
same side of the board now this is a
technical draw it's been known for

250
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:18,000
technical draw it's been known for
 

251
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,629
technical draw it's been known for
probably let's just say 70 years roughly

252
00:04:20,629 --> 00:04:20,639
probably let's just say 70 years roughly
 

253
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,490
probably let's just say 70 years roughly
give or take that this is a theoretical

254
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:22,500
give or take that this is a theoretical
 

255
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,350
give or take that this is a theoretical
draw no matter the position of the pawns

256
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:24,360
draw no matter the position of the pawns
 

257
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,909
draw no matter the position of the pawns
it's just all the pawns are on one side

258
00:04:25,909 --> 00:04:25,919
it's just all the pawns are on one side
 

259
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,070
it's just all the pawns are on one side
of the board so like but like where they

260
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:28,080
of the board so like but like where they
 

261
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,749
of the board so like but like where they
are so it's like let's just say they're

262
00:04:29,749 --> 00:04:29,759
are so it's like let's just say they're
 

263
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,129
are so it's like let's just say they're
let's just say they're four pawns right

264
00:04:31,129 --> 00:04:31,139
let's just say they're four pawns right
 

265
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:33,230
let's just say they're four pawns right
here they're just four pawns and black

266
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:33,240
here they're just four pawns and black
 

267
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,390
here they're just four pawns and black
is three pawns so your pawns are on H6

268
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:35,400
is three pawns so your pawns are on H6
 

269
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,670
is three pawns so your pawns are on H6
G6 and F6 and there are no other pawns

270
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:37,680
G6 and F6 and there are no other pawns
 

271
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,469
G6 and F6 and there are no other pawns
on the board something like this and you

272
00:04:39,469 --> 00:04:39,479
on the board something like this and you
 

273
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,510
on the board something like this and you
both have Rooks and it's a draw no

274
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:41,520
both have Rooks and it's a draw no
 

275
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,490
both have Rooks and it's a draw no
matter what the next next like 50 moves

276
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:43,500
matter what the next next like 50 moves
 

277
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,110
matter what the next next like 50 moves
of the game are we know that it's a

278
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:45,120
of the game are we know that it's a
 

279
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,310
of the game are we know that it's a
drawn end game

280
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:46,320
drawn end game
 

281
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,870
drawn end game
um with perfect play and so it was

282
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:47,880
um with perfect play and so it was
 

283
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,670
um with perfect play and so it was
things like this where Magnus actually

284
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:49,680
things like this where Magnus actually
 

285
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,650
things like this where Magnus actually
saved I want to say like five or six of

286
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:51,660
saved I want to say like five or six of
 

287
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,689
saved I want to say like five or six of
these and I remember it quite well

288
00:04:53,689 --> 00:04:53,699
these and I remember it quite well
 

289
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:55,550
these and I remember it quite well
because I think the score was very very

290
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:55,560
because I think the score was very very
 

291
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,770
because I think the score was very very
close up until probably the last like 10

292
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:57,780
close up until probably the last like 10
 

293
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,450
close up until probably the last like 10
games of the match and then at the end

294
00:04:59,450 --> 00:04:59,460
games of the match and then at the end
 

295
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,370
games of the match and then at the end
he started winning he started winning in

296
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:01,380
he started winning he started winning in
 

297
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,629
he started winning he started winning in
Spades but there were a lot of

298
00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:02,639
Spades but there were a lot of
 

299
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,370
Spades but there were a lot of
situations where he was up like one game

300
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:04,380
situations where he was up like one game
 

301
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,870
situations where he was up like one game
or maybe two games in the match and I

302
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:05,880
or maybe two games in the match and I
 

303
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,670
or maybe two games in the match and I
had some end game like this and I was

304
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:07,680
had some end game like this and I was
 

305
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,550
had some end game like this and I was
not able to win the end game and so for

306
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:10,560
not able to win the end game and so for
 

307
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,590
not able to win the end game and so for
me after that match it wasn't even so

308
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:12,600
me after that match it wasn't even so
 

309
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,450
me after that match it wasn't even so
much that I lost the match with a margin

310
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:14,460
much that I lost the match with a margin
 

311
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,189
much that I lost the match with a margin
I lost by but it was the fact that I

312
00:05:16,189 --> 00:05:16,199
I lost by but it was the fact that I
 

313
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:18,230
I lost by but it was the fact that I
realized how hard it was to beat him

314
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:18,240
realized how hard it was to beat him
 

315
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,390
realized how hard it was to beat him
even once you got the advantage and I

316
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:20,400
even once you got the advantage and I
 

317
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,070
even once you got the advantage and I
think for Magnus he learned that my

318
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:22,080
think for Magnus he learned that my
 

319
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,330
think for Magnus he learned that my
weakness was the openings I remember

320
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:23,340
weakness was the openings I remember
 

321
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,610
weakness was the openings I remember
because I actually I don't remember the

322
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:25,620
because I actually I don't remember the
 

323
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,629
because I actually I don't remember the
game itself but there was a game we

324
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:26,639
game itself but there was a game we
 

325
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,490
game itself but there was a game we
played in the Sicilian night or um and

326
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:28,500
played in the Sicilian night or um and
 

327
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,170
played in the Sicilian night or um and
he played this variation with Bishop G5

328
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:30,180
he played this variation with Bishop G5
 

329
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,270
he played this variation with Bishop G5
on move number six I'm sure you can you

330
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:32,280
on move number six I'm sure you can you
 

331
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,950
on move number six I'm sure you can you
can insert a graphic later I can show

332
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:33,960
can insert a graphic later I can show
 

333
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,370
can insert a graphic later I can show
you and I think it's a type of opening

334
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:36,380
you and I think it's a type of opening
 

335
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,330
you and I think it's a type of opening
sicilian's the opening night orifice

336
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:38,340
sicilian's the opening night orifice
 

337
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,430
sicilian's the opening night orifice
variation it was played by Bobby Fischer

338
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:40,440
variation it was played by Bobby Fischer
 

339
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,950
variation it was played by Bobby Fischer
the form world champion Gary Kasparov as

340
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:42,960
the form world champion Gary Kasparov as
 

341
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,050
the form world champion Gary Kasparov as
well and so we played all sorts of

342
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:45,060
well and so we played all sorts of
 

343
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:45,950
well and so we played all sorts of
different openings because of course

344
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:45,960
different openings because of course
 

345
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,990
different openings because of course
it's not as serious it's it's a serious

346
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:48,000
it's not as serious it's it's a serious
 

347
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,730
it's not as serious it's it's a serious
match but it's not serious where it's

348
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:49,740
match but it's not serious where it's
 

349
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,990
match but it's not serious where it's
going to count for the ranking so you're

350
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:51,000
going to count for the ranking so you're
 

351
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,850
going to count for the ranking so you're
trying to fill out where your opponent

352
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:52,860
trying to fill out where your opponent
 

353
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,890
trying to fill out where your opponent
is strong versus weak and so there was

354
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:54,900
is strong versus weak and so there was
 

355
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,330
is strong versus weak and so there was
one game I remember this very clearly he

356
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:56,340
one game I remember this very clearly he
 

357
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,129
one game I remember this very clearly he
played the bishop G5 variation in the

358
00:05:58,129 --> 00:05:58,139
played the bishop G5 variation in the
 

359
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:00,710
played the bishop G5 variation in the
night or and I think I played E5 or I

360
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:00,720
night or and I think I played E5 or I
 

361
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,450
night or and I think I played E5 or I
played Knight bd7 and E5 which is

362
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:02,460
played Knight bd7 and E5 which is
 

363
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:05,150
played Knight bd7 and E5 which is
dubious it's not the best response and

364
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:05,160
dubious it's not the best response and
 

365
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,529
dubious it's not the best response and
that's just one example where I was

366
00:06:06,529 --> 00:06:06,539
that's just one example where I was
 

367
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:07,490
that's just one example where I was
playing things that were a little bit

368
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:07,500
playing things that were a little bit
 

369
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,170
playing things that were a little bit
dubious and I was not playing the

370
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:09,180
dubious and I was not playing the
 

371
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,150
dubious and I was not playing the
absolute main line with 20 moves of

372
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:11,160
absolute main line with 20 moves of
 

373
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,770
absolute main line with 20 moves of
theory so I was trying to get outside of

374
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:12,780
theory so I was trying to get outside of
 

375
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,810
theory so I was trying to get outside of
Theory and I think Magnus learned from

376
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:14,820
Theory and I think Magnus learned from
 

377
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,730
Theory and I think Magnus learned from
that that even though it appeared that I

378
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:16,740
that that even though it appeared that I
 

379
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,409
that that even though it appeared that I
was very well prepared in in these

380
00:06:18,409 --> 00:06:18,419
was very well prepared in in these
 

381
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:20,990
was very well prepared in in these
openings I wasn't quite at that level

382
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:21,000
openings I wasn't quite at that level
 

383
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,490
openings I wasn't quite at that level
couldn't you have a different

384
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:22,500
couldn't you have a different
 

385
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,950
couldn't you have a different
interpretation of you going outside of

386
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:24,960
interpretation of you going outside of
 

387
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,990
interpretation of you going outside of
the main line that you're willing to

388
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:27,000
the main line that you're willing to
 

389
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,670
the main line that you're willing to
experiment take risks that you're

390
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:28,680
experiment take risks that you're
 

391
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,350
experiment take risks that you're
chaotic and that's actually a strength

392
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:30,360
chaotic and that's actually a strength
 

393
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,210
chaotic and that's actually a strength
not a weakness especially when you're

394
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:32,220
not a weakness especially when you're
 

395
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:35,210
not a weakness especially when you're
sitting in a hotel room at late at night

396
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:35,220
sitting in a hotel room at late at night
 

397
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,270
sitting in a hotel room at late at night
this is past midnight

398
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:37,280
this is past midnight
 

399
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,650
this is past midnight
playing chess I mean why do you

400
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:39,660
playing chess I mean why do you
 

401
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:40,850
playing chess I mean why do you
interpret that that's your weakness

402
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:40,860
interpret that that's your weakness
 

403
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,670
interpret that that's your weakness
because Magnus going forward was able to

404
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:43,680
because Magnus going forward was able to
 

405
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,129
because Magnus going forward was able to
figure out the lines where you have to

406
00:06:46,129 --> 00:06:46,139
figure out the lines where you have to
 

407
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:48,290
figure out the lines where you have to
be super precise you cannot deviate at

408
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:48,300
be super precise you cannot deviate at
 

409
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,150
be super precise you cannot deviate at
all and I got punished out of the

410
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:50,160
all and I got punished out of the
 

411
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,890
all and I got punished out of the
opening in many games so it was like it

412
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:51,900
opening in many games so it was like it
 

413
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,330
opening in many games so it was like it
wasn't about the night or if the the

414
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:53,340
wasn't about the night or if the the
 

415
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,010
wasn't about the night or if the the
opening or the variation specifically

416
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:55,020
opening or the variation specifically
 

417
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,930

but he knew what my repertoire was and

418
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:56,940
but he knew what my repertoire was and
 

419
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,790
but he knew what my repertoire was and
we'd pick lines where I had to play the

420
00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:58,800
we'd pick lines where I had to play the
 

421
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,969
we'd pick lines where I had to play the
absolute best lines in order to equalize

422
00:07:01,969 --> 00:07:01,979
absolute best lines in order to equalize
 

423
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:03,650
absolute best lines in order to equalize
um or I would be much worse and he was

424
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:03,660
um or I would be much worse and he was
 

425
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,270
um or I would be much worse and he was
very effective at doing that but

426
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:05,280
very effective at doing that but
 

427
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,610
very effective at doing that but
nevertheless it's pretty legendary that

for a reason if I look at in terms of
 

553
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,370
for a reason if I look at in terms of
potentially like World Championship

554
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:19,380
potentially like World Championship
 

555
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:22,250
potentially like World Championship
aspirations I think certainly it was a

556
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:22,260
aspirations I think certainly it was a
 

557
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,110
aspirations I think certainly it was a
big mistake because from a competitive

00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:24,120
big mistake because from a competitive
 

559
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,850
big mistake because from a competitive
standpoint Magnus figured out what my

560
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:25,860
standpoint Magnus figured out what my
 

561
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,530
standpoint Magnus figured out what my
weaknesses were at the time and he

562
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:27,540
weaknesses were at the time and he
 

563
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,750
weaknesses were at the time and he
exploited it for many many years in fact

564
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:29,760
exploited it for many many years in fact
 

565
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,790
exploited it for many many years in fact
I think if you look at the match I

566
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:31,800
I think if you look at the match I
 

567
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,110
I think if you look at the match I
played against him in the Melt water

568
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:33,120
played against him in the Melt water
 

569
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,410
played against him in the Melt water
tournament at the I think that was in

570
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:35,420
tournament at the I think that was in
 

571
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,490
tournament at the I think that was in
June or no it was later it's like

572
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:37,500
June or no it was later it's like
 

573
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,290

September of 2020 we played this epic

574
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:39,300
September of 2020 we played this epic
 

575
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,810
September of 2020 we played this epic
match it was the finals of the tour and

576
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:41,820
match it was the finals of the tour and
 

577
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,310
match it was the finals of the tour and
it went all the way to the seventh match

578
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:43,320
it went all the way to the seventh match
 

579
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,550
it went all the way to the seventh match
Magnus won in Armageddon and in that

580
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:46,560
Magnus won in Armageddon and in that
 

581
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,230
Magnus won in Armageddon and in that
match my openings were much better I was

582
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:48,240
match my openings were much better I was
 

583
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,910
match my openings were much better I was
able to match him in the openings I was

584
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:49,920
able to match him in the openings I was
 

585
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,650
able to match him in the openings I was
not worse out of the opening of most the

586
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:51,660
not worse out of the opening of most the
 

587
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,030
not worse out of the opening of most the
games and that made a huge difference

588
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:53,040
games and that made a huge difference
 

589
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,790
games and that made a huge difference
but for many years he was able to

590
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:55,800
but for many years he was able to
 

591
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,070
but for many years he was able to
exploit my openings and I mean that's

592
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:58,080
exploit my openings and I mean that's
 

593
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,870
exploit my openings and I mean that's
why the score I mean it's not the only

594
00:09:59,870 --> 00:09:59,880
why the score I mean it's not the only
 

595
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,070
why the score I mean it's not the only
reason but it's one of the reasons the

596
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:01,080
reason but it's one of the reasons the
 

597
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,889
reason but it's one of the reasons the
score is so long opsided the way it is

598
00:10:03,889 --> 00:10:03,899
score is so long opsided the way it is
 

599
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:06,230
score is so long opsided the way it is
is there any of those games that you

600
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:06,240
is there any of those games that you
 

601
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,370
is there any of those games that you
mentioned seven games that are

602
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:07,380
mentioned seven games that are
 

603
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,710
mentioned seven games that are
interesting to look at to analyze the

604
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:09,720
interesting to look at to analyze the
 

605
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,210
interesting to look at to analyze the
ideas and then you remember that are

606
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:11,220
ideas and then you remember that are
 

607
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,250
ideas and then you remember that are
interesting to you I mean the whole it

608
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:13,260
interesting to you I mean the whole it
 

609
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,350
interesting to you I mean the whole it
was actually so to set it up and this

610
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:15,360
was actually so to set it up and this
 

611
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,610
was actually so to set it up and this
probably will come into play in terms of

612
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:16,620
probably will come into play in terms of
 

613
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,530
probably will come into play in terms of
world championship format

614
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:18,540
world championship format
 

615
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,990
world championship format
um it was seven matches of four games so

616
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:21,000
um it was seven matches of four games so
 

617
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,389
um it was seven matches of four games so
we played a four game match and after

618
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:23,399
we played a four game match and after
 

619
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:25,070
we played a four game match and after
four games Sam up two and a half one and

620
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:25,080
four games Sam up two and a half one and
 

621
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,170
four games Sam up two and a half one and
a half I win match number one then then

622
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:27,180
a half I win match number one then then
 

623
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,250
a half I win match number one then then
it's so it's like you're doing four

624
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:28,260
it's so it's like you're doing four
 

625
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,050
it's so it's like you're doing four
matches of four games do you remember

626
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:30,060
matches of four games do you remember
 

627
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,790
matches of four games do you remember
how you won there were a couple of

628
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:31,800
how you won there were a couple of
 

629
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,370
how you won there were a couple of
Berlin games uh in the sixth sixth match

630
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:34,380
Berlin games uh in the sixth sixth match
 

631
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,690
Berlin games uh in the sixth sixth match
I believe in the seventh match as well

632
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:35,700
I believe in the seventh match as well
 

633
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,430
I believe in the seventh match as well
where Magnus actually made some mistakes

634
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:37,440
where Magnus actually made some mistakes
 

635
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,470
where Magnus actually made some mistakes
and I won some critical games you're

636
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:39,480
and I won some critical games you're
 

637
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,970
and I won some critical games you're
gonna have to explain some Basics here

638
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:40,980
gonna have to explain some Basics here
 

639
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,590
gonna have to explain some Basics here
so Berlin is the type of opening what's

640
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:42,600
so Berlin is the type of opening what's
 

641
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,650
so Berlin is the type of opening what's
that the Roy Lopez or Spanish uh opening

642
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:45,660
that the Roy Lopez or Spanish uh opening
 

643
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,630
that the Roy Lopez or Spanish uh opening
it actually existed all the way back in

644
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:47,640
it actually existed all the way back in
 

645
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,030
it actually existed all the way back in
the 60s but it really became popular in

646
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:50,040
the 60s but it really became popular in
 

647
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,670
the 60s but it really became popular in
2000 and one I believe it was when Gary

648
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:52,680
2000 and one I believe it was when Gary
 

649
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,829
2000 and one I believe it was when Gary
Kasparov and Vladimir kramnik play their

650
00:10:54,829 --> 00:10:54,839
Kasparov and Vladimir kramnik play their
 

651
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:56,509
Kasparov and Vladimir kramnik play their
world championship match sparov had been

652
00:10:56,509 --> 00:10:56,519
world championship match sparov had been
 

653
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:58,310
world championship match sparov had been
the world champion for a very long time

654
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:58,320
the world champion for a very long time
 

655
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,110
the world champion for a very long time
I think it was close I think it was

656
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:00,120
I think it was close I think it was
 

657
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,810
I think it was close I think it was
about 15 15 years roughly maybe a little

658
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:02,820
about 15 15 years roughly maybe a little
 

659
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,389
about 15 15 years roughly maybe a little
bit more than that um and he lost the

660
00:11:05,389 --> 00:11:05,399
bit more than that um and he lost the
 

661
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:06,590
bit more than that um and he lost the
match because when Gary had the white

662
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:06,600
match because when Gary had the white
 

663
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,290
match because when Gary had the white
piece as far was not able to effectively

664
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:09,300
piece as far was not able to effectively
 

665
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,850
piece as far was not able to effectively

were very quick draws and in chess you

668
00:11:12,769 --> 00:11:12,779
were very quick draws and in chess you
 

669
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:14,150
were very quick draws and in chess you
want to put pressure on your opponent

670
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:14,160
want to put pressure on your opponent

when you have the white pieces so kaspar
 

673
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,329
when you have the white pieces so kaspar
was not able to do anything with the

674
00:11:17,329 --> 00:11:17,339
was not able to do anything with the
 

675
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:18,889
was not able to do anything with the
white pieces and kramnik was able to

676
00:11:18,889 --> 00:11:18,899
white pieces and kramnik was able to
 

677
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:20,990
white pieces and kramnik was able to
beat him when the colors were reversed

678
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:21,000
beat him when the colors were reversed
 

679
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,970
beat him when the colors were reversed
Kramer when I game the groin felt he won

680
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:22,980
Kramer when I game the groin felt he won
 

681
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,410
Kramer when I game the groin felt he won
a game and wanted the Queen's Gambit

682

declined slash nimso variations as well

684
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:27,120
declined slash nimso variations as well
 

685
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,630
declined slash nimso variations as well
and um that was the reason Gary sparov

686
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:29,640
and um that was the reason Gary sparov
 

687
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,889
and um that was the reason Gary sparov
lost the world championship title was

lost the world championship title was
because of this this variation can you

690
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:32,940
because of this this variation can you
 

691
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,610
because of this this variation can you
teach me the Berlin opening absolutely

692
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:34,620
teach me the Berlin opening absolutely
 

693
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,069
teach me the Berlin opening absolutely
so the opening starts let me just move

694
00:11:37,069 --> 00:11:37,079
so the opening starts let me just move
 

695
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:38,329
so the opening starts let me just move
this microphone up a little bit starts

696
00:11:38,329 --> 00:11:38,339
this microphone up a little bit starts
 

697
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:40,130
this microphone up a little bit starts
with E4

698
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:40,140
with E4
 

699
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,530
with E4
and then it goes E5

700
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:42,540
and then it goes E5
 

701
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,030
and then it goes E5
Knight F3

702
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:44,040
Knight F3
 

703
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,769
Knight F3
Knight C6

704
00:11:47,769 --> 00:11:47,779

 

705
00:11:47,779 --> 00:11:50,210

yeah there should be five

706
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:50,220
yeah there should be five
 

707
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:54,530
yeah there should be five
and now Knight to F6

708
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:54,540

 

709
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,750

and uh at which point is this the

710
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:56,760
and uh at which point is this the
 

711
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,090
and uh at which point is this the
standard like this is the the Berlin

712
00:11:59,090 --> 00:11:59,100
standard like this is the the Berlin
 

713
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,889
standard like this is the the Berlin
yeah this is the Berlin this is the

714
00:12:00,889 --> 00:12:00,899
yeah this is the Berlin this is the
 

715
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:02,449
yeah this is the Berlin this is the
starting position of the Berlin defense

716
00:12:02,449 --> 00:12:02,459
starting position of the Berlin defense
 

717
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:05,329
starting position of the Berlin defense
and white has many many options here now

718
00:12:05,329 --> 00:12:05,339
and white has many many options here now
 

719
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:07,250
and white has many many options here now
it's interesting because I did work with

720
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:07,260
it's interesting because I did work with
 

721
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,769
it's interesting because I did work with
Gary at a certain point and I remember I

722
00:12:09,769 --> 00:12:09,779
Gary at a certain point and I remember I
 

723
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:12,710
Gary at a certain point and I remember I
I had access to his database and he had

724
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:12,720
I had access to his database and he had
 

725
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,350
I had access to his database and he had
something like 220 files on the Berlin

726
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:15,360
something like 220 files on the Berlin
 

727
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,389
something like 220 files on the Berlin
defense because what happened is as

728
00:12:17,389 --> 00:12:17,399
defense because what happened is as
 

729
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:19,130
defense because what happened is as
Gary's somebody who the way that he

730
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:19,140
Gary's somebody who the way that he
 

731
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,050
Gary's somebody who the way that he
learned chess it's very much like there

732
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:21,060
learned chess it's very much like there
 

733
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,670
learned chess it's very much like there
are certain openings that are okay there

734
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:22,680
are certain openings that are okay there
 

735
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,990
are certain openings that are okay there
are other openings that are not okay

736
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:24,000
are other openings that are not okay
 

737
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,910
are other openings that are not okay
yeah and so this was considered dubious

738
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:25,920
yeah and so this was considered dubious
 

739
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,130
yeah and so this was considered dubious
at the time and so Gary basically

740
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:28,140
at the time and so Gary basically
 

741
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,930
at the time and so Gary basically
decided to go into this end game with

742
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:29,940
decided to go into this end game with
 

743
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:32,030
decided to go into this end game with
castles Knight takes Pawn was the

744
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:32,040
castles Knight takes Pawn was the
 

745
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,190
castles Knight takes Pawn was the
castling and then game so I'll show you

746
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:34,200
castling and then game so I'll show you
 

747
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,990
castling and then game so I'll show you
Knight takes Pawn all these moves are

748
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:36,000
Knight takes Pawn all these moves are
 

749
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,389
Knight takes Pawn all these moves are
very uh very forced

750
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:38,399
very uh very forced
 

751
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,490
very uh very forced
he got ponded what does it mean they're

752
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:40,500
he got ponded what does it mean they're
 

753
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,810
he got ponded what does it mean they're
very forced that means like those are

754
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:41,820
very forced that means like those are
 

755
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,190
very forced that means like those are
the optimal things that you should be

756
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:43,200
the optimal things that you should be
 

757
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,470
the optimal things that you should be
doing exactly these moves are um I think

758
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:45,480
doing exactly these moves are um I think
 

759
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,329
doing exactly these moves are um I think
they're almost at least for black

760
00:12:47,329 --> 00:12:47,339
they're almost at least for black
 

761
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:48,710
they're almost at least for black
they're absolutely forced or else you

762
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:48,720
they're absolutely forced or else you
 

763
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,090
they're absolutely forced or else you
end up in trouble you said Knight takes

764
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:50,100
end up in trouble you said Knight takes
 

765
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,850
end up in trouble you said Knight takes
D4 Knight to D6 oh okay so this attacks

end game
 

785
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,449
end game
you just ruined uh all the normal

786
00:13:17,449 --> 00:13:17,459
you just ruined uh all the normal
 

787
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:19,670
you just ruined uh all the normal

hand for kramnik it was quite brilliant

790
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:21,360
hand for kramnik it was quite brilliant
 

791
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,629
hand for kramnik it was quite brilliant
because Gary what he was known for was

792
00:13:23,629 --> 00:13:23,639
because Gary what he was known for was
 

793
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:25,190
because Gary what he was known for was
opening preparation and getting the

00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:25,200
opening preparation and getting the
 

795
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,629
opening preparation and getting the
advantages of very tactical very

aggressive player and you're playing an

end game right from the start now Gary

800
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:30,480
end game right from the start now Gary
 

801
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,810
end game right from the start now Gary
basically thought that this was better

802
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:32,820
basically thought that this was better
 

803
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,910
basically thought that this was better
for white and he tried to prove it and

804
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:34,920
for white and he tried to prove it and
 

805
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,769
for white and he tried to prove it and
he was unable to prove it I think up

806
00:13:36,769 --> 00:13:36,779
he was unable to prove it I think up
 

807
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:39,470
he was unable to prove it I think up
until maybe it was game game nine or

808
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:39,480
until maybe it was game game nine or
 

809
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,090
until maybe it was game game nine or
game 11 actually maybe the order wrong

810
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:41,100
game 11 actually maybe the order wrong
 

811
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,170
game 11 actually maybe the order wrong
because I think he was white in the even

812
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:42,180
because I think he was white in the even
 

813
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,910
because I think he was white in the even
number games basically he spent four or

814
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:43,920
number games basically he spent four or
 

815
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,530
number games basically he spent four or
five games with white pieces trying to

816
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:45,540
five games with white pieces trying to
 

817
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,750
five games with white pieces trying to
win this end game and he was not able to

818
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:47,760
win this end game and he was not able to
 

819
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,370
win this end game and he was not able to
win in fact he didn't even come close to

820
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:49,380
win in fact he didn't even come close to
 

821
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,470
win in fact he didn't even come close to
proving an advantage so he kept wasting

822
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:51,480
proving an advantage so he kept wasting
 

823
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,509
proving an advantage so he kept wasting
the white pieces in that match and

824
00:13:53,509 --> 00:13:53,519
the white pieces in that match and
 

825
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,129
the white pieces in that match and
cranwick basically took advantage when

826
00:13:55,129 --> 00:13:55,139
cranwick basically took advantage when
 

827
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:56,509
cranwick basically took advantage when
he had the white pieces and Gary the

828
00:13:56,509 --> 00:13:56,519
he had the white pieces and Gary the
 

829
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:58,370
he had the white pieces and Gary the
black pieces he was able to win some

830
00:13:58,370 --> 00:13:58,380
black pieces he was able to win some
 

831
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,269
black pieces he was able to win some
games

832
00:13:59,269 --> 00:13:59,279
games
 

833
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,370
games
um in very nice style and that was the

834
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:01,380
um in very nice style and that was the
 

835
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,110
um in very nice style and that was the
difference so that's kind of brilliant

836
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:03,120
difference so that's kind of brilliant
 

837
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,389
difference so that's kind of brilliant
so he had this is a new problem

838
00:14:05,389 --> 00:14:05,399
so he had this is a new problem
 

839
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:08,329
so he had this is a new problem
presented in that match and Gary's gut

840
00:14:08,329 --> 00:14:08,339
presented in that match and Gary's gut
 

841
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:11,569
presented in that match and Gary's gut
says white is better white is better and

842
00:14:11,569 --> 00:14:11,579
says white is better white is better and
 

843
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:13,490
says white is better white is better and
so in white I'm going to push with this

844
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:13,500
so in white I'm going to push with this
 

845
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,590
so in white I'm going to push with this
position and I'm going to not change

846
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:15,600
position and I'm going to not change
 

847
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,930
position and I'm going to not change
anything from Mash to match I'm going to

848
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:17,940
anything from Mash to match I'm going to
 

849
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,150
anything from Mash to match I'm going to
try to find a way that this is better so

850
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:20,160
try to find a way that this is better so
 

851
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,850
try to find a way that this is better so
it's that kind of stubbornness and what

852
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:22,860
it's that kind of stubbornness and what
 

853
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,590
it's that kind of stubbornness and what
do you think about that like what that

854
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:24,600
do you think about that like what that
 

855
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,389
do you think about that like what that
that's that's the way of Chess right

856
00:14:26,389 --> 00:14:26,399
that's that's the way of Chess right
 

857
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,250
that's that's the way of Chess right
that's not a mistake that's that's the

858
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:28,260
that's not a mistake that's that's the
 

859
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,810
that's not a mistake that's that's the
way you should do it if your gut says

860
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:29,820
way you should do it if your gut says
 

861
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:32,509
way you should do it if your gut says
this this position is better you should

862
00:14:32,509 --> 00:14:32,519
this this position is better you should
 

863
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:34,550
this this position is better you should
capitalize right I think that's an old

864
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:34,560
capitalize right I think that's an old
 

865
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,350
capitalize right I think that's an old
school way of thinking and Trust because

866
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:36,360
school way of thinking and Trust because
 

867
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,530
school way of thinking and Trust because
before computers it basically is up to

868
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:39,540
before computers it basically is up to
 

869
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,449
before computers it basically is up to
humans your intuition your calculation

870
00:14:41,449 --> 00:14:41,459
humans your intuition your calculation
 

871
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:44,090
humans your intuition your calculation
process really determined

872
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:44,100
process really determined
 

873
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,889
process really determined
um whether whether a position is better

874
00:14:45,889 --> 00:14:45,899
um whether whether a position is better
 

875
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:47,930
um whether whether a position is better
and so like if in Gary's time if

876
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:47,940
and so like if in Gary's time if
 

877
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,670
and so like if in Gary's time if
openings were dubious they're dubious it

878
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:49,680
openings were dubious they're dubious it
 

879
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,410
openings were dubious they're dubious it
means somebody is better but as we've

880
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:51,420
means somebody is better but as we've
 

881
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,509
means somebody is better but as we've
learned with computers now even small

882
00:14:53,509 --> 00:14:53,519
learned with computers now even small
 

883
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,129
learned with computers now even small
advantages generally that doesn't mean

884
00:14:55,129 --> 00:14:55,139
advantages generally that doesn't mean
 

885
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:57,110
advantages generally that doesn't mean
anything and a position is defendable

886
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:57,120
anything and a position is defendable
 

887
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,389
anything and a position is defendable
where you won't lose the game if you

888
00:14:59,389 --> 00:14:59,399
where you won't lose the game if you
 

889
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,370
where you won't lose the game if you
play optimal moves even if the advantage

890
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:01,380
play optimal moves even if the advantage
 

891
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,470
play optimal moves even if the advantage
is like half a pawn for example like

892
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:03,480
is like half a pawn for example like
 

893
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,949
is like half a pawn for example like
0.50 with optimal play a computer will

894
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:06,959
0.50 with optimal play a computer will
 

895
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,110
0.50 with optimal play a computer will
still prove that that position you can

896
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:09,120
still prove that that position you can
 

897
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,050
still prove that that position you can
hold it and not lose the game and so for

898
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:12,060
hold it and not lose the game and so for
 

899
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,490
hold it and not lose the game and so for
Gary he learned it where like if an

900
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:13,500
Gary he learned it where like if an
 

901
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,470
Gary he learned it where like if an
opening's not right you like he knows

902
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:15,480
opening's not right you like he knows
 

903
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,569
opening's not right you like he knows
it's not correct he has to prove it now

904
00:15:17,569 --> 00:15:17,579
it's not correct he has to prove it now
 

905
00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:18,889
it's not correct he has to prove it now
finally towards the end of the match he

906
00:15:18,889 --> 00:15:18,899
finally towards the end of the match he
 

907
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:20,449
finally towards the end of the match he
tried to switch but it was already way

908
00:15:20,449 --> 00:15:20,459
tried to switch but it was already way
 

909
00:15:20,459 --> 00:15:22,910
tried to switch but it was already way
too late and he didn't have time to to

910
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:22,920
too late and he didn't have time to to
 

911
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,290
too late and he didn't have time to to
win with the white pieces he did come

912
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:24,300
win with the white pieces he did come
 

913
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,210
win with the white pieces he did come
close in one of the later games uh but

914
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:26,220
close in one of the later games uh but
 

915
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,470
close in one of the later games uh but
he spent the whole match trying to prove

916
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:27,480
he spent the whole match trying to prove
 

917
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,449
he spent the whole match trying to prove
that this Berlin defense is not playable

918
00:15:29,449 --> 00:15:29,459
that this Berlin defense is not playable
 

919
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:31,430
that this Berlin defense is not playable
so this position the computer would say

920
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:31,440
so this position the computer would say
 

921
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,530
so this position the computer would say
uh that black is better it would say

922
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:33,540
uh that black is better it would say
 

923
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,850
uh that black is better it would say
that White's very slightly better

924
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:34,860
that White's very slightly better
 

925
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,530
that White's very slightly better
because black has moved the king you're

926
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:36,540
because black has moved the king you're
 

927
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,329
because black has moved the king you're
unable to Castle the king and it's kind

928
00:15:38,329 --> 00:15:38,339
unable to Castle the king and it's kind
 

929
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:40,189
unable to Castle the king and it's kind
of open in the center of the board oh so

930
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:40,199
of open in the center of the board oh so
 

931
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:42,530
of open in the center of the board oh so
wait so stockfish or Daniel would agree

932
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:42,540
wait so stockfish or Daniel would agree
 

933
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,990
wait so stockfish or Daniel would agree
with Gary's intuition yes but at the end

934
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:45,000
with Gary's intuition yes but at the end
 

935
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,670
with Gary's intuition yes but at the end
of the day when you go like five moves

936
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:46,680
of the day when you go like five moves
 

937
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,050
of the day when you go like five moves
deeper in any number of the sequences

938
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:48,060
deeper in any number of the sequences
 

939
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:51,230
deeper in any number of the sequences
it's gonna go to 0.00 which means draw

940
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:51,240
it's gonna go to 0.00 which means draw
 

941
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,269
it's gonna go to 0.00 which means draw
yes correct and that's a bad thing

942
00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:53,279
yes correct and that's a bad thing
 

943
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,490
yes correct and that's a bad thing

00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,289
push the pawn to E5 or push the pawn to
E6 okay so there are many different

1102
00:18:45,289 --> 00:18:45,299
E6 okay so there are many different
 

1103
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:47,930
E6 okay so there are many different
setups and it's very very flexible but

1104
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:47,940
setups and it's very very flexible but
 

1105
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,850
setups and it's very very flexible but
white is the one who who has the choice

1106
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:49,860
white is the one who who has the choice
 

1107
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,770
white is the one who who has the choice
here in terms of what to play and there

1108
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:51,780
here in terms of what to play and there
 

1109
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,270
here in terms of what to play and there
are many moves there's this move that I

1110
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:53,280
are many moves there's this move that I
 

1111
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,010
are many moves there's this move that I
mentioned before Bishop to G5 which

1112
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:55,020
mentioned before Bishop to G5 which
 

1113
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,289
mentioned before Bishop to G5 which
Magnus played against me there's also

1114
00:18:57,289 --> 00:18:57,299
Magnus played against me there's also
 

1115
00:18:57,299 --> 00:19:01,010
Magnus played against me there's also
Bishop to E3 Bishop to C4 and now

1116
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:01,020
Bishop to E3 Bishop to C4 and now
 

1117
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:05,150
Bishop to E3 Bishop to C4 and now
they're also moves like H3 H4 Rook G1

1118
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:05,160
they're also moves like H3 H4 Rook G1
 

1119
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,010
they're also moves like H3 H4 Rook G1
um even moves like A3 and A4 so they're

1120
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:07,020
um even moves like A3 and A4 so they're
 

1121
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,390
um even moves like A3 and A4 so they're
basically are nine or ten moves that

1122
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:08,400
basically are nine or ten moves that
 

1123
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,250
basically are nine or ten moves that
white can play here but the move that

1124
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:10,260
white can play here but the move that
 

1125
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,690
white can play here but the move that
white plays sort of dictates the

1126
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:11,700
white plays sort of dictates the
 

1127
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,150
white plays sort of dictates the
direction of the game and you have to be

1128
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:14,160
direction of the game and you have to be
 

1129
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,650
direction of the game and you have to be
extremely precise if you're black so if

1130
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:15,660
extremely precise if you're black so if
 

1131
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,970
extremely precise if you're black so if
white plays something like Bishop G5

1132
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:16,980
white plays something like Bishop G5
 

1133
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,130
white plays something like Bishop G5
this is very sharp and aggressive but

1134
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:19,140
this is very sharp and aggressive but
 

1135
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,810
this is very sharp and aggressive but
you can also play something like Bishop

1136
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:20,820
you can also play something like Bishop
 

1137
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,390
you can also play something like Bishop
to E3 Pawn to E5 and something like

1138
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:23,400
to E3 Pawn to E5 and something like
 

1139
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,029
to E3 Pawn to E5 and something like
Knight to F3 here and it goes in a

1140
00:19:26,029 --> 00:19:26,039
Knight to F3 here and it goes in a
 

1141
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,529
Knight to F3 here and it goes in a
positional Direction

1142
00:19:27,529 --> 00:19:27,539
positional Direction
 

1143
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:30,409
positional Direction
so the again this is very Advanced these

1144
00:19:30,409 --> 00:19:30,419
so the again this is very Advanced these
 

1145
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,990
so the again this is very Advanced these
are very Advanced um sort of setups and

1146
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:33,000
are very Advanced um sort of setups and
 

1147
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,330
are very Advanced um sort of setups and
and what I'm explaining is not not at a

1148
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:35,340
and what I'm explaining is not not at a
 

1149
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,190
and what I'm explaining is not not at a
basic level but why does it want to

1150
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:37,200
basic level but why does it want to
 

1151
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,450
basic level but why does it want to
choose as a type of game is it very

1152
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:38,460
choose as a type of game is it very
 

1153
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,190
choose as a type of game is it very
aggressive very sharp or both sides of

1154
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:40,200
aggressive very sharp or both sides of
 

1155
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,049
aggressive very sharp or both sides of
chances is it something very positional

1156
00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:42,059
chances is it something very positional
 

1157
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:43,970
chances is it something very positional
where if you're black you're probably

1158
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:43,980
where if you're black you're probably
 

1159
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,890
where if you're black you're probably
okay but you have to play the best moves

1160
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:45,900
okay but you have to play the best moves
 

1161
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,630
okay but you have to play the best moves
in order to equalize or you can end up

1162
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:47,640
in order to equalize or you can end up
 

1163
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,610
in order to equalize or you can end up
worse okay so you're always responding

1164
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:49,620
worse okay so you're always responding
 

1165
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:52,430
worse okay so you're always responding
as black in this situation correct so so

1166
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:52,440
as black in this situation correct so so
 

1167
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,990
as black in this situation correct so so
how different are all those different

1168
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:54,000
how different are all those different
 

1169
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,330
how different are all those different
variations so like with the bishop with

1170
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:56,340
variations so like with the bishop with
 

1171
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,490
variations so like with the bishop with
a different you said you you bring out

1172
00:19:58,490 --> 00:19:58,500
a different you said you you bring out
 

1173
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,830
a different you said you you bring out
the bishop to this position to this

1174
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:00,840
the bishop to this position to this
 

1175
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,110
the bishop to this position to this
position or to that position like how

1176
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:03,120
position or to that position like how
 

1177
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,250
position or to that position like how
are those fundamentally different

1178
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:04,260
are those fundamentally different
 

1179
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,830
are those fundamentally different
variations like I I just wonder

1180
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:06,840
variations like I I just wonder
 

1181
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,470
variations like I I just wonder
from uh AI computational perspective

1182
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:09,480
from uh AI computational perspective
 

1183
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,870
from uh AI computational perspective
like a single step yeah well I'll make

1184
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:11,880
like a single step yeah well I'll make
 

1185
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,190
like a single step yeah well I'll make
it even simpler here if you put the

1186
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:13,200
it even simpler here if you put the
 

1187
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,990
it even simpler here if you put the
Knight here it's very positional if you

1188
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:15,000
Knight here it's very positional if you
 

1189
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,370
Knight here it's very positional if you
put the Knight on this Square it's very

1190
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:16,380
put the Knight on this Square it's very
 

1191
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,230
put the Knight on this Square it's very
aggressive because normally white is

1192
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:18,240
aggressive because normally white is
 

1193
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,630
aggressive because normally white is
going to push this Pawn uh from F2 to

1194
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:20,640
going to push this Pawn uh from F2 to
 

1195
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,150
going to push this Pawn uh from F2 to
either F3 or F4 and potentially a pawn

1196
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:23,160
either F3 or F4 and potentially a pawn
 

1197
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,730
either F3 or F4 and potentially a pawn
to G4 later so even here based on where

1198
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:25,740
to G4 later so even here based on where
 

1199
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,710
to G4 later so even here based on where
you go it changes whether it's a

1200
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:27,720
you go it changes whether it's a
 

1201
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,450
you go it changes whether it's a
positional game or it's a very tactical

1202
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:29,460
positional game or it's a very tactical
 

1203
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,830
positional game or it's a very tactical
it's just those little and that those

1204
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:30,840
it's just those little and that those
 

1205
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,330
it's just those little and that those
are the choices you're constantly making

1206
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:32,340
are the choices you're constantly making
 

1207
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:35,870
are the choices you're constantly making
am I going to be standard and basic

1208
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:35,880
am I going to be standard and basic
 

1209
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,370
am I going to be standard and basic
compositional or am I going to be

1210
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:37,380
compositional or am I going to be
 

1211
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,289
compositional or am I going to be
aggressive and I can actually give you

1212
00:20:39,289 --> 00:20:39,299
aggressive and I can actually give you
 

1213
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:42,470
aggressive and I can actually give you
another example so psychology plays a

1214
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:42,480
another example so psychology plays a
 

1215
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,789
another example so psychology plays a
big role and in the candidates

1216
00:20:43,789 --> 00:20:43,799
big role and in the candidates

originally from Iran representing France
 

1227
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,730
originally from Iran representing France
and I knew that he wanted very

1228
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:55,740
and I knew that he wanted very
 

1229
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,049
and I knew that he wanted very
aggressive games so he doesn't normally

1230
00:20:57,049 --> 00:20:57,059
aggressive games so he doesn't normally
 

1231
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:58,909
aggressive games so he doesn't normally
play the slain Idol and he chose to play

1232
00:20:58,909 --> 00:20:58,919
play the slain Idol and he chose to play
 

1233
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:00,289
play the slain Idol and he chose to play
it in this one tournament so I knew that

1234
00:21:00,289 --> 00:21:00,299
it in this one tournament so I knew that
 

1235
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:01,970
it in this one tournament so I knew that
he wanted these very sharp positions

1236
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:01,980
he wanted these very sharp positions
 

1237
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,070
he wanted these very sharp positions
where he can lose but he can also win

1238
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:04,080
where he can lose but he can also win
 

1239
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,990
where he can lose but he can also win
and so when I played him I intentionally

1240
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:06,000
and so when I played him I intentionally
 

1241
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,090
and so when I played him I intentionally
played this very Asian because I knew

1242
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:08,100
played this very Asian because I knew
 

1243
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,350
played this very Asian because I knew
that he was going to be unhappy he

1244
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:09,360
that he was going to be unhappy he
 

1245

wanted these sharp exciting games and
 

1247
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,950
wanted these sharp exciting games and
here I am playing something very boring

1248
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:12,960
here I am playing something very boring
 

1249
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,510
here I am playing something very boring
where if he plays it correctly it's

1250
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:14,520
where if he plays it correctly it's
 

1251
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,190
where if he plays it correctly it's
going to be a draw but he's not going to

1252
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:16,200
going to be a draw but he's not going to
 

1253
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,630
going to be a draw but he's not going to
be happy and so he actually did

1254

at all cylinders well it's not just a
problem with me this is the problem

1292
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:03,000
problem with me this is the problem
 

1293
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,350
problem with me this is the problem
everybody against Magnus because what

1294
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:06,360
everybody against Magnus because what
 

1295
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:09,470
everybody against Magnus because what
happens is is is on a broader level when

1296
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:09,480
happens is is is on a broader level when
 

1297
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,270
happens is is is on a broader level when
you're playing on somebody no matter who

1298
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:11,280
you're playing on somebody no matter who
 

1299
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,350
you're playing on somebody no matter who
you're playing against but when they're

1300
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:12,360
you're playing against but when they're
 

1301
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,210
you're playing against but when they're
somehow able to save positions where

1302
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:14,220
somehow able to save positions where
 

1303
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:16,669
somehow able to save positions where
they're much worse almost in miraculous

1304
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:16,679
they're much worse almost in miraculous
 

1305
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:18,409
they're much worse almost in miraculous
ways the way that Magnus is done against

00:22:18,409 --> 00:22:18,419
ways the way that Magnus is done against
 

1307
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:20,270
ways the way that Magnus is done against
everybody he's done it against me done

1308
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:20,280
everybody he's done it against me done
 

1309
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,950
everybody he's done it against me done
against aronian many times done it

1310
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:21,960
against aronian many times done it
 

1311
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,330
against aronian many times done it
against cramming just about everybody

1312
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:23,340
against cramming just about everybody
 

1313
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:26,090
against cramming just about everybody
when when someone's able to save games

1314
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:26,100
when when someone's able to save games
 

1315
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,610
when when someone's able to save games
it really starts to affect you because

1316
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:28,620
it really starts to affect you because
 

1317
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:31,370
it really starts to affect you because
you don't know what to do and more and

1318
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:31,380
you don't know what to do and more and
 

1319
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,450
you don't know what to do and more and
more the more and more times that

1320
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:32,460
more the more and more times that
 

1321
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,310
more the more and more times that
happens it starts adding up and it just

1322
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:34,320
happens it starts adding up and it just
 

1323
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,930
happens it starts adding up and it just
affects you in a way that it's very very

1324
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:35,940
affects you in a way that it's very very
 

1325
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,970
affects you in a way that it's very very
hard to overcome and I think every top

1326
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:37,980
hard to overcome and I think every top
 

1327
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:40,190
hard to overcome and I think every top
player has that issue where if they've

1328
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:40,200
player has that issue where if they've
 

1329
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,870
player has that issue where if they've
played against Magnus more than like

1330
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:41,880
played against Magnus more than like
 

1331
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,909
played against Magnus more than like
five times they've seen things happen in

1332
00:22:43,909 --> 00:22:43,919
five times they've seen things happen in
 

1333
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:45,649
five times they've seen things happen in
the game that don't happen against

1334
00:22:45,649 --> 00:22:45,659
the game that don't happen against
 

1335
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:47,870
the game that don't happen against
anybody else and then psychologically it

1336
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:47,880
anybody else and then psychologically it
 

1337
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,490
anybody else and then psychologically it
becomes harder and harder to overcome it

1338
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:49,500
becomes harder and harder to overcome it
 

1339
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,990
becomes harder and harder to overcome it
which is why I think a lot of the junior

1340
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:51,000
which is why I think a lot of the junior
 

1341
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,669
which is why I think a lot of the junior
players they don't have this long

1342
00:22:52,669 --> 00:22:52,679
players they don't have this long
 

1343
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:55,130
players they don't have this long
history and it does affect them as far

1344
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:55,140
history and it does affect them as far
 

1345
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,110
history and it does affect them as far
as myself directly

1346
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:57,120
as myself directly
 

1347
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,930
as myself directly
um certainly after that match though it

1348
00:22:59,930 --> 00:22:59,940
um certainly after that match though it
 

1349
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,549
um certainly after that match though it
was not the same playing against Magnus

1350
00:23:01,549 --> 00:23:01,559
was not the same playing against Magnus
 

1351
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:02,690
was not the same playing against Magnus
because I viewed him completely

1352
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:02,700
because I viewed him completely
 

1353
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,430
because I viewed him completely
differently too after all those games

1354
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:04,440
differently too after all those games
 

1355
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,750
differently too after all those games
where he was saving these these end

1356
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:05,760
where he was saving these these end
 

1357
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,090
where he was saving these these end
games I sort of thing like this guy is

1358
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:08,100
games I sort of thing like this guy is
 

1359
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,130
games I sort of thing like this guy is
superhuman but you can't really have

1360
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:10,140
superhuman but you can't really have
 

1361
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,510
superhuman but you can't really have
those thoughts when you're playing

1362
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:11,520
those thoughts when you're playing
 

1363
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,549
those thoughts when you're playing
competitively but in the back of your

1364
00:23:13,549 --> 00:23:13,559
competitively but in the back of your
 

1365
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,110
competitively but in the back of your
mind it's always there and I think every

1366
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:15,120
mind it's always there and I think every
 

1367
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,669
mind it's always there and I think every
toddler has that issue is there a way to

1368
00:23:16,669 --> 00:23:16,679
toddler has that issue is there a way to
 

1369
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:18,590
toddler has that issue is there a way to
overcome that because you have to I

1370
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:18,600
overcome that because you have to I
 

1371
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,090
overcome that because you have to I
don't know if I'll necessarily do better

1372
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:20,100
don't know if I'll necessarily do better
 

1373
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,430
don't know if I'll necessarily do better
against Magnus going forward but I felt

1374
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:22,440
against Magnus going forward but I felt
 

1375
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,350
against Magnus going forward but I felt
that when I started playing against him

1376
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:24,360
that when I started playing against him
 

1377
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,149
that when I started playing against him
more than just a game here there in

1378
00:23:26,149 --> 00:23:26,159
more than just a game here there in
 

1379
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,130
more than just a game here there in
classical chess during the pandemic I

1380
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:28,140
classical chess during the pandemic I
 

1381
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,630
classical chess during the pandemic I
played in these online tournaments it

1382
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:29,640
played in these online tournaments it
 

1383
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,130
played in these online tournaments it
seemed like every month

1384
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:31,140
seemed like every month
 

1385
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,810
seemed like every month
um I came very close I beat him in one

1386
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:32,820
um I came very close I beat him in one
 

1387
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,730
um I came very close I beat him in one
event I think I lost and two others and

1388
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:34,740
event I think I lost and two others and
 

1389
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,470
event I think I lost and two others and
then the two are final but when I was

1390
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:36,480
then the two are final but when I was
 

1391
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,390
then the two are final but when I was
playing against them more and more if he

1392
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:38,400
playing against them more and more if he
 

1393
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,950
playing against them more and more if he
didn't feel superhuman it felt like as

1394
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:39,960
didn't feel superhuman it felt like as
 

1395
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,390
didn't feel superhuman it felt like as
I'm playing more and more and learning

1396
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:41,400
I'm playing more and more and learning
 

1397
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,190
I'm playing more and more and learning
about his style

1398
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:43,200
about his style
 

1399
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,350
about his style
um that I was doing better so I think

1400
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:45,360
um that I was doing better so I think
 

1401
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,990
um that I was doing better so I think
for me the weird thing is that I just

1402
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:48,000
for me the weird thing is that I just
 

1403
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,250
for me the weird thing is that I just
wasn't playing against him that many

1404
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:49,260
wasn't playing against him that many
 

1405
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,570
wasn't playing against him that many
games but when I started playing as like

1406
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:50,580
games but when I started playing as like
 

1407
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,970
games but when I started playing as like
20 30 games during the course of a year

1408
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:52,980
20 30 games during the course of a year
 

1409
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,230
20 30 games during the course of a year
I actually started feeling more

1410
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:54,240
I actually started feeling more
 

1411
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,490
I actually started feeling more
confident because I feel like I can

1412
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:55,500
confident because I feel like I can
 

1413
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,289
confident because I feel like I can
compete whereas when I was only playing

1414
00:23:57,289 --> 00:23:57,299
compete whereas when I was only playing
 

1415
00:23:57,299 --> 00:23:59,570
compete whereas when I was only playing
him like three or four times in

1416
00:23:59,570 --> 00:23:59,580
him like three or four times in
 

1417
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,909
him like three or four times in
classical chess in the previous couple

1418
00:24:01,909 --> 00:24:01,919
classical chess in the previous couple
 

1419
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,110
classical chess in the previous couple
of years

1420
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:03,120
of years
 

1421
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,210
of years
it was I wasn't doing great and then you

1422
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:05,220
it was I wasn't doing great and then you
 

1423
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,890
it was I wasn't doing great and then you
don't have you don't have those glimpses

1424
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:06,900
don't have you don't have those glimpses
 

1425
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,390
don't have you don't have those glimpses
of you don't have those moments where

1426
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:08,400
of you don't have those moments where
 

1427
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,590
of you don't have those moments where
you feel like you're going to be able to

1428
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:09,600
you feel like you're going to be able to
 

1429
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,970
you feel like you're going to be able to
win against them but when you start

1430
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:10,980
win against them but when you start
 

1431
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,590
win against them but when you start
playing 20 30 games and you get these

1432
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:12,600
playing 20 30 games and you get these
 

1433
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,330
playing 20 30 games and you get these
opportunities even if you don't convert

1434
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:14,340
opportunities even if you don't convert
 

1435
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,770
opportunities even if you don't convert
you feel like you have the chances when

1436
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:15,780
you feel like you have the chances when
 

1437
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,450
you feel like you have the chances when
you play three or four games and they're

1438
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:17,460
you play three or four games and they're
 

1439
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,730
you play three or four games and they're
you might lose one draw three you never

1440
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:19,740
you might lose one draw three you never
 

1441
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,169
you might lose one draw three you never
have those opportunities and so you feel

1442
00:24:21,169 --> 00:24:21,179
have those opportunities and so you feel
 

1443
00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:23,570
have those opportunities and so you feel
very negative about what's going on when

1444
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:23,580
very negative about what's going on when
 

1445
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:26,029
very negative about what's going on when
you were able to beat them or not

1446
00:24:26,029 --> 00:24:26,039
you were able to beat them or not
 

1447
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:27,950
you were able to beat them or not
necessarily win the game but win

1448
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:27,960
necessarily win the game but win
 

1449
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,529
necessarily win the game but win
positionally something uh what was the

1450
00:24:30,529 --> 00:24:30,539
positionally something uh what was the
 

1451
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:32,110
positionally something uh what was the
reason like

1452
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:32,120
reason like
 

1453
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,970
reason like
technically speaking

1454
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:34,980
technically speaking
 

1455
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:37,130
technically speaking
the matchup between the two of you what

1456
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:37,140
the matchup between the two of you what
 

1457
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,750
the matchup between the two of you what
like where where are the holes that you

1458
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:38,760
like where where are the holes that you
 

1459
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,669
like where where are the holes that you
were able to find I mean the the answer

1460
00:24:40,669 --> 00:24:40,679
were able to find I mean the the answer
 

1461
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:42,049
were able to find I mean the the answer
I think is actually quite simple I think

1462
00:24:42,049 --> 00:24:42,059
I think is actually quite simple I think
 

1463
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:43,970
I think is actually quite simple I think
it's all psychological actually more

1464
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:43,980
it's all psychological actually more
 

1465
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,409
it's all psychological actually more
than anything else

1466
00:24:45,409 --> 00:24:45,419
than anything else
 

1467
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:46,190
than anything else
um

1468
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:46,200
um
 

1469
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,710
um
because I didn't it didn't I didn't feel

1470
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:48,720
because I didn't it didn't I didn't feel
 

1471
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,930
because I didn't it didn't I didn't feel
like I was doing anything differently

1472
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:50,940
like I was doing anything differently
 

1473
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:53,210
like I was doing anything differently
but I was also not making the mistakes

1474
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:53,220
but I was also not making the mistakes
 

1475
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,190
but I was also not making the mistakes
that I was making before

1476
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:55,200
that I was making before
 

1477
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,750
that I was making before
um so I think it was more psychological

1478
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:56,760
um so I think it was more psychological
 

1479
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,810
um so I think it was more psychological
than on your part versus his part it's

1480
00:24:59,810 --> 00:24:59,820
than on your part versus his part it's
 

1481
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,190
than on your part versus his part it's
it's very weird because when you when

1482
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:01,200
it's very weird because when you when
 

1483
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,070
it's very weird because when you when
you think about Chess it's a mental game

1484
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:04,080
you think about Chess it's a mental game
 

1485
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,130
you think about Chess it's a mental game
um you know but we we all are capable of

1486
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:07,140
um you know but we we all are capable of
 

1487
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:09,710
um you know but we we all are capable of
beating Magnus all of us but we all have

1488
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:09,720
beating Magnus all of us but we all have
 

1489
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,169
beating Magnus all of us but we all have
very very bad scores against him and I

1490
00:25:12,169 --> 00:25:12,179
very very bad scores against him and I
 

1491
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:14,810
very very bad scores against him and I
think people underestimate how much of a

1492
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:14,820
think people underestimate how much of a
 

1493
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,190
think people underestimate how much of a
role that plays

1494
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:16,200
role that plays
 

1495
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,310
role that plays
um and for me when I played him in these

1496
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:19,320
um and for me when I played him in these
 

1497
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:22,070
um and for me when I played him in these
online events in 2020 specifically I

1498
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:22,080
online events in 2020 specifically I
 

1499
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,690
online events in 2020 specifically I
felt like there there was really nothing

1500
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:23,700
felt like there there was really nothing
 

1501
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,450
felt like there there was really nothing
to lose which also ties into everything

1502
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:26,460
to lose which also ties into everything
 

1503
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,250
to lose which also ties into everything
else that happened um during the

1504
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:28,260
else that happened um during the
 

1505
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,049
else that happened um during the
pandemic as well but I just feel like

1506
00:25:30,049 --> 00:25:30,059
pandemic as well but I just feel like
 

1507
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:31,130
pandemic as well but I just feel like
there was nothing to lose and I felt

1508
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:31,140
there was nothing to lose and I felt
 

1509
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,810
there was nothing to lose and I felt
like I was playing very freely unlike

1510
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:32,820
like I was playing very freely unlike
 

1511
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,549
like I was playing very freely unlike
unlike before now that's not to say that

1512
00:25:34,549 --> 00:25:34,559
unlike before now that's not to say that
 

1513
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,110
unlike before now that's not to say that
Magnus isn't a better player that like

1514
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:36,120
Magnus isn't a better player that like
 

1515
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,149
Magnus isn't a better player that like
somehow I expect to beat him but I felt

1516
00:25:38,149 --> 00:25:38,159
somehow I expect to beat him but I felt
 

1517
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:39,890
somehow I expect to beat him but I felt
like I wasn't making the same mistakes

1518
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:39,900
like I wasn't making the same mistakes
 

1519
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,990
like I wasn't making the same mistakes
that I was making in the previous years

1520
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:42,000
that I was making in the previous years
 

1521
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,850
that I was making in the previous years
if we dig into the psychological

1522
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:43,860
if we dig into the psychological
 

1523
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:46,130
if we dig into the psychological
preparation is there something to your

1524
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:46,140
preparation is there something to your
 

1525
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,450
preparation is there something to your
mental preparation that you do that

1526
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:47,460
mental preparation that you do that
 

1527
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,549
mental preparation that you do that
makes you successful like what are the

1528
00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:49,559
makes you successful like what are the
 

1529
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:50,930
makes you successful like what are the
lessons over all these years that you

1530
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:50,940
lessons over all these years that you
 

1531
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:53,510
lessons over all these years that you
learned what works what doesn't do you

1532
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:53,520
learned what works what doesn't do you
 

1533
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,710
learned what works what doesn't do you
drink a bunch of whiskey the night

1534
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:54,720
drink a bunch of whiskey the night
 

1535
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,289
drink a bunch of whiskey the night
before is there is there some is there

1536
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:57,299
before is there is there some is there
 

1537
00:25:57,299 --> 00:25:59,570
before is there is there some is there
some small hacks or major ones about how

1538
00:25:59,570 --> 00:25:59,580
some small hacks or major ones about how
 

1539
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,909
some small hacks or major ones about how
you approach the game it's really hard

1540
00:26:01,909 --> 00:26:01,919
you approach the game it's really hard
 

1541
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,310
you approach the game it's really hard
sort of in a way because I feel like I'm

1542
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:04,320
sort of in a way because I feel like I'm
 

1543
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,890
sort of in a way because I feel like I'm
two different people I was one person up

1544
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:06,900
two different people I was one person up
 

1545
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,450
two different people I was one person up
until the pandemic as a professional

1546
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:08,460
until the pandemic as a professional
 

1547
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,850
until the pandemic as a professional
chess player solely where I earned all

1548
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:10,860
chess player solely where I earned all
 

1549
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,470
chess player solely where I earned all
my income everything was derived from

1550
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:12,480
my income everything was derived from
 

1551
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,169
my income everything was derived from
that and from the pandemic on I'm sort

1552
00:26:15,169 --> 00:26:15,179
that and from the pandemic on I'm sort
 

1553
00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:16,190
that and from the pandemic on I'm sort
of a different person because that is

1554
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:16,200
of a different person because that is
 

1555
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,350
of a different person because that is
not where where I'm making my income

1556
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:18,360
not where where I'm making my income
 

1557
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,510
not where where I'm making my income
from and so the whole psychological

1558
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:20,520
from and so the whole psychological
 

1559
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,730
from and so the whole psychological
profile that I had before is completely

1560
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:22,740
profile that I had before is completely
 

1561
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,890
profile that I had before is completely
different from now uh there's this this

1562
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:24,900
different from now uh there's this this
 

1563
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,870
different from now uh there's this this
joke about the I literally don't care

1564
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:26,880
joke about the I literally don't care
 

1565
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,029
joke about the I literally don't care
the phrase that I've used and

1566
00:26:29,029 --> 00:26:29,039
the phrase that I've used and
 

1567
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:31,370
the phrase that I've used and
in a sense what that means is not that I

1568
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:31,380
in a sense what that means is not that I
 

1569
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,110
in a sense what that means is not that I
don't care obviously I'm competitive I

1570
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:33,120
don't care obviously I'm competitive I
 

1571
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,570
don't care obviously I'm competitive I
want to do well but if I lose the game

1572
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:35,580
want to do well but if I lose the game
 

1573
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,490
want to do well but if I lose the game
or I don't do well in a tournament it's

1574
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:37,500
or I don't do well in a tournament it's
 

1575
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,110
or I don't do well in a tournament it's
not the end of the world in the same

1576
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:39,120
not the end of the world in the same
 

1577
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,610
not the end of the world in the same
kind of way that I felt it was before

1578
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:40,620
kind of way that I felt it was before
 

1579
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,590
kind of way that I felt it was before
because that pressure of needing to

1580
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:42,600
because that pressure of needing to
 

1581
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,590
because that pressure of needing to
always perform was very very high

1582
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:45,600
always perform was very very high
 

1583
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,810
always perform was very very high
um and so I think before before the

1584
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:47,820
um and so I think before before the
 

1585
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,970
um and so I think before before the
pandemic what I would try to do more

1586
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:49,980
pandemic what I would try to do more
 

1587
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,250
pandemic what I would try to do more
than anything is just not think about

1588
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:52,260
than anything is just not think about
 

1589
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,750
than anything is just not think about
the previous game for the most part like

1590
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:53,760
the previous game for the most part like
 

1591
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,370
the previous game for the most part like
say I had a bad game I'd go out for a

1592
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:55,380
say I had a bad game I'd go out for a
 

1593
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,230
say I had a bad game I'd go out for a
walk that evening just clear my mind

1594
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:57,240
walk that evening just clear my mind
 

1595
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,610
walk that evening just clear my mind
these sorts of things now they aren't

1596
00:26:58,610 --> 00:26:58,620
these sorts of things now they aren't
 

1597
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,529
these sorts of things now they aren't
really hacks per se but it's trying

1598
00:27:00,529 --> 00:27:00,539
really hacks per se but it's trying
 

1599
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:02,149
really hacks per se but it's trying
essentially to have short-term memory

1600
00:27:02,149 --> 00:27:02,159
essentially to have short-term memory
 

1601
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:03,710
essentially to have short-term memory
loss so

1602
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:03,720
loss so
 

1603
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,169
loss so
so I literally don't care it's not just

1604
00:27:06,169 --> 00:27:06,179
so I literally don't care it's not just
 

1605
00:27:06,179 --> 00:27:08,870
so I literally don't care it's not just
the meme it's a it's a philosophy in a

1606
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:08,880
the meme it's a it's a philosophy in a
 

1607
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,430
the meme it's a it's a philosophy in a
sense it's a way of being I mean it's

1608
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:10,440
sense it's a way of being I mean it's
 

1609
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,769
sense it's a way of being I mean it's
it's basically that yes like I do want

1613
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:16,610
to perform well I'm going to give it my

1615
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,810
all but it's not like it if I lose a

Tombstone yes which which I think

00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:35,520
Tombstone yes which which I think
 

1631
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,289
Tombstone yes which which I think
emphasizes a similar concept but

1632
00:27:39,289 --> 00:27:39,299
emphasizes a similar concept but
 

1633
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:41,330
emphasizes a similar concept but
slightly different more in the artistic

1634
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:41,340
slightly different more in the artistic
 

1635
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:44,090
slightly different more in the artistic
domain which is uh well a lot of people

1636
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:44,100
domain which is uh well a lot of people
 

1637
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,950
domain which is uh well a lot of people
have different interpretations of that

1638
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:45,960
have different interpretations of that
 

1639
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,049
have different interpretations of that
statement but I think it means

1640
00:27:48,049 --> 00:27:48,059
statement but I think it means
 

1641
00:27:48,059 --> 00:27:49,730
statement but I think it means
don't take

1642
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:49,740
don't take
 

1643
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:52,970
don't take
things too seriously yeah I I mean I I

1644
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:52,980
things too seriously yeah I I mean I I
 

1645
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:56,149
things too seriously yeah I I mean I I
agree with that completely I think that

1646
00:27:56,149 --> 00:27:56,159
agree with that completely I think that
 

1647
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:58,430
agree with that completely I think that
um if you if you look at my career prior

1648
00:27:58,430 --> 00:27:58,440
um if you if you look at my career prior
 

1649
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,529
um if you if you look at my career prior
to the pandemic I put huge amounts of

1650
00:28:00,529 --> 00:28:00,539
to the pandemic I put huge amounts of
 

1651
00:28:00,539 --> 00:28:02,810
to the pandemic I put huge amounts of
pressure on myself because

1652
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:02,820
pressure on myself because
 

1653
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,909
pressure on myself because
I really want to be as good as I could

1654
00:28:04,909 --> 00:28:04,919
I really want to be as good as I could
 

1655
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:06,769
I really want to be as good as I could
be but but it was the way I was earning

1656
00:28:06,769 --> 00:28:06,779
be but but it was the way I was earning
 

1657
00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:08,330
be but but it was the way I was earning
a living and one thing that's very

1658
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:08,340
a living and one thing that's very
 

1659
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:10,250
a living and one thing that's very
difficult about Chess is that only the

1660
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:10,260
difficult about Chess is that only the
 

1661
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:12,169
difficult about Chess is that only the
top 20 maybe 30 players in the world

1662
00:28:12,169 --> 00:28:12,179
top 20 maybe 30 players in the world
 

1663
00:28:12,179 --> 00:28:13,909
top 20 maybe 30 players in the world
make a living from the game now you make

1664
00:28:13,909 --> 00:28:13,919
make a living from the game now you make
 

1665
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:15,289
make a living from the game now you make
a very good living

1666
00:28:15,289 --> 00:28:15,299
a very good living
 

1667
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:17,149
a very good living
um in no way am I diminishing chess but

1668
00:28:17,149 --> 00:28:17,159
um in no way am I diminishing chess but
 

1669
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:19,370
um in no way am I diminishing chess but
the problem with it is it's not secure

1670
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:19,380
the problem with it is it's not secure
 

1671
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,409
the problem with it is it's not secure
at all so if you don't get invitations

1672
00:28:21,409 --> 00:28:21,419
at all so if you don't get invitations
 

1673
00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:23,330
at all so if you don't get invitations
to the absolute top tournaments which

1674
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:23,340
to the absolute top tournaments which
 

1675
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:25,490
to the absolute top tournaments which
have prize funds from anywhere from

1676
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:25,500
have prize funds from anywhere from
 

1677
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,630
have prize funds from anywhere from
maybe a hundred thousand up to

1678
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:26,640
maybe a hundred thousand up to
 

1679
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,490
maybe a hundred thousand up to
potentially half a million dollars if

1680
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:28,500
potentially half a million dollars if
 

1681
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,169
potentially half a million dollars if
you don't get those invitations it's

1682
00:28:30,169 --> 00:28:30,179
you don't get those invitations it's
 

1683
00:28:30,179 --> 00:28:31,789
you don't get those invitations it's
very very hard to earn a living you can

1684
00:28:31,789 --> 00:28:31,799
very very hard to earn a living you can
 

1685
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:33,110
very very hard to earn a living you can
go from earning maybe two hundred

1686
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:33,120
go from earning maybe two hundred
 

1687
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,130
go from earning maybe two hundred
thousand three hundred thousand dollars

1688
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:34,140
thousand three hundred thousand dollars
 

1689
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:36,409
thousand three hundred thousand dollars
a year to earning like fifty thousand so

1690
00:28:36,409 --> 00:28:36,419
a year to earning like fifty thousand so
 

1691
00:28:36,419 --> 00:28:39,529
a year to earning like fifty thousand so
it's very very unstable and I think

1692
00:28:39,529 --> 00:28:39,539
it's very very unstable and I think
 

1693
00:28:39,539 --> 00:28:41,510
it's very very unstable and I think
um for myself I really put a lot of

1694
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:41,520
um for myself I really put a lot of
 

1695
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,789
um for myself I really put a lot of
pressure on myself and in a way that it

1696
00:28:43,789 --> 00:28:43,799
pressure on myself and in a way that it
 

1697
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:46,190
pressure on myself and in a way that it
affected me and not not in a good way

1698
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:46,200
affected me and not not in a good way
 

1699
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,590
affected me and not not in a good way
not in so in part it was also Financial

1700
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:48,600
not in so in part it was also Financial
 

1701
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,110
not in so in part it was also Financial
pressure so like once you're able to

1702
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:51,120
pressure so like once you're able to
 

1703
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,289
pressure so like once you're able to
make money elsewhere it it makes you

1704
00:28:54,289 --> 00:28:54,299
make money elsewhere it it makes you
 

1705
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:57,409
make money elsewhere it it makes you
more free to take risks to play the the

1706
00:28:57,409 --> 00:28:57,419
more free to take risks to play the the
 

1707
00:28:57,419 --> 00:28:59,330
more free to take risks to play the the
pure game of chess yeah it makes yeah

1708
00:28:59,330 --> 00:28:59,340
pure game of chess yeah it makes yeah
 

1709
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,370
pure game of chess yeah it makes yeah
exactly it makes it made me it took all

1710
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:01,380
exactly it makes it made me it took all
 

1711
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:03,350
exactly it makes it made me it took all
that pressure off and I kind of I'm just

1712
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:03,360
that pressure off and I kind of I'm just
 

1713
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,970
that pressure off and I kind of I'm just
trying to play as well as I can and I

1714
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:04,980
trying to play as well as I can and I
 

1715
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,409
trying to play as well as I can and I
don't really worry like if I lose the

1716
00:29:06,409 --> 00:29:06,419
don't really worry like if I lose the
 

1717
00:29:06,419 --> 00:29:08,149
don't really worry like if I lose the
game it's not the end-all be-all and

1718
00:29:08,149 --> 00:29:08,159
game it's not the end-all be-all and
 

1719
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,370
game it's not the end-all be-all and
maybe that's just like psychological

1720
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:10,380
maybe that's just like psychological
 

1721
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,690
maybe that's just like psychological
stuff that I should have tried to sort

1722
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:11,700
stuff that I should have tried to sort
 

1723
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:14,269
stuff that I should have tried to sort
out before I mean I did it some period

1724
00:29:14,269 --> 00:29:14,279
out before I mean I did it some period
 

1725
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:15,470
out before I mean I did it some period
of time like do certain things along

1726
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:15,480
of time like do certain things along
 

1727
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,630
of time like do certain things along
those lines but

1728
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:17,640
those lines but
 

1729
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,029
those lines but
um I I just yeah I became became free

1730
00:29:20,029 --> 00:29:20,039
um I I just yeah I became became free
 

1731
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:22,549
um I I just yeah I became became free
and I think it it definitely it was not

1732
00:29:22,549 --> 00:29:22,559
and I think it it definitely it was not
 

1733
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:23,990
and I think it it definitely it was not
about the chess and that's one of those

1734
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:24,000
about the chess and that's one of those
 

1735
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,330
about the chess and that's one of those
things that's also very hard because

1736
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:26,340
things that's also very hard because
 

1737
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,310
things that's also very hard because
when I look at myself and when I had

1738
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:28,320
when I look at myself and when I had
 

1739
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,630
when I look at myself and when I had
these periods where it seemed like I

1740
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:29,640
these periods where it seemed like I
 

1741
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,549
these periods where it seemed like I
played better or improved one of these

1742
00:29:31,549 --> 00:29:31,559
played better or improved one of these
 

1743
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:36,049
played better or improved one of these
periods um was in 2008 where I basically

1744
00:29:36,049 --> 00:29:36,059
periods um was in 2008 where I basically
 

1745
00:29:36,059 --> 00:29:37,549
periods um was in 2008 where I basically
I dropped out of college I was about

1746
00:29:37,549 --> 00:29:37,559
I dropped out of college I was about
 

1747
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:40,310
I dropped out of college I was about
26.50 ELO so I was roughly top 100 in

1748
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:40,320
26.50 ELO so I was roughly top 100 in
 

1749
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,230
26.50 ELO so I was roughly top 100 in
the world and for the first probably

1750
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:42,240
the world and for the first probably
 

1751
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,750
the world and for the first probably
half part of 2008 I played very little

1752
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:44,760
half part of 2008 I played very little
 

1753
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:47,210
half part of 2008 I played very little
almost not all I went up to Vancouver I

1754
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:47,220
almost not all I went up to Vancouver I
 

1755
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,649
almost not all I went up to Vancouver I
was living on my own for the first time

1756
00:29:48,649 --> 00:29:48,659
was living on my own for the first time
 

1757
00:29:48,659 --> 00:29:51,289
was living on my own for the first time
and I was not studying that much and

1758
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:51,299
and I was not studying that much and
 

1759
00:29:51,299 --> 00:29:52,549
and I was not studying that much and
then after that period I started playing

1760
00:29:52,549 --> 00:29:52,559
then after that period I started playing
 

1761
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,590
then after that period I started playing
and I actually improved very quickly and

1762
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:54,600
and I actually improved very quickly and
 

1763
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,409
and I actually improved very quickly and
I broke 2 700 shortly thereafter so it

1764
00:29:57,409 --> 00:29:57,419
I broke 2 700 shortly thereafter so it
 

1765
00:29:57,419 --> 00:29:59,210
I broke 2 700 shortly thereafter so it
had nothing to do with chess when you

1766
00:29:59,210 --> 00:29:59,220
had nothing to do with chess when you
 

1767
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:02,690

good that that that's an interesting

1788
00:30:25,549 --> 00:30:25,559
good that that that's an interesting
 

1789
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:26,990
good that that that's an interesting
break so dropping out of college and

1790
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:27,000
break so dropping out of college and
 

1791
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,330
break so dropping out of college and
then giving taking a break and then

1792
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:29,340
then giving taking a break and then
 

1793
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:31,490
then giving taking a break and then
giving everything to chess in terms of

1794
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:31,500
giving everything to chess in terms of
 

1795
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,230
giving everything to chess in terms of
preparation and so on

1796
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:33,240
preparation and so on
 

1797
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,110
preparation and so on
uh maybe actually if you can rewind back

1798
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:36,120
uh maybe actually if you can rewind back
 

1799
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,870
uh maybe actually if you can rewind back
to the to the beginning you've said

1800
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:38,880
to the to the beginning you've said
 

1801
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,090
to the to the beginning you've said
about yourself that you're not a

1802
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:41,100
about yourself that you're not a
 

1803
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,430
about yourself that you're not a
naturally talented chess player uh your

1804
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:43,440
naturally talented chess player uh your
 

1805
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,289
naturally talented chess player uh your
brother was but that's really

1806
00:30:45,289 --> 00:30:45,299
brother was but that's really
 

1807
00:30:45,299 --> 00:30:48,710
brother was but that's really
fascinating because what would you say

1808
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:48,720
fascinating because what would you say
 

1809
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,289
fascinating because what would you say
was the reason you're able to break

1810
00:30:51,289 --> 00:30:51,299
was the reason you're able to break
 

1811
00:30:51,299 --> 00:30:53,149
was the reason you're able to break
through and become one of the best chess

1812
00:30:53,149 --> 00:30:53,159
through and become one of the best chess
 

1813
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:55,789
through and become one of the best chess
players in the world having been not a

1814
00:30:55,789 --> 00:30:55,799
players in the world having been not a
 

1815
00:30:55,799 --> 00:30:58,010
players in the world having been not a
naturally talented chess player yeah I

1816
00:30:58,010 --> 00:30:58,020
naturally talented chess player yeah I
 

1817
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,529
naturally talented chess player yeah I
think that this applies to actually

1818
00:30:59,529 --> 00:30:59,539
think that this applies to actually
 

1819
00:30:59,539 --> 00:31:02,269
think that this applies to actually
chess or any number of sort of basic

1820
00:31:02,269 --> 00:31:02,279
chess or any number of sort of basic
 

1821
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:03,950
chess or any number of sort of basic
games actually for that matter is that

1822
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:03,960
games actually for that matter is that
 

1823
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,350
games actually for that matter is that
I'm not naturally talented but if I

1824
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:06,360
I'm not naturally talented but if I
 

1825
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,990
I'm not naturally talented but if I
don't get something I'm I try to figure

1826
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:09,000
don't get something I'm I try to figure
 

1827
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,549
don't get something I'm I try to figure
out why don't I get it what am I doing

1828
00:31:10,549 --> 00:31:10,559
out why don't I get it what am I doing
 

1829
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:13,310
out why don't I get it what am I doing
wrong over and over and over again and

1830
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:13,320
wrong over and over and over again and
 

1831
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,289
wrong over and over and over again and
um I mean there are many games like this

1832
00:31:15,289 --> 00:31:15,299
um I mean there are many games like this
 

1833
00:31:15,299 --> 00:31:16,909
um I mean there are many games like this
uh there's this funny game on the phone

1834
00:31:16,909 --> 00:31:16,919
uh there's this funny game on the phone
 

1835
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:18,529
uh there's this funny game on the phone
I'll just use it as an example there's a

1836
00:31:18,529 --> 00:31:18,539
I'll just use it as an example there's a
 

1837
00:31:18,539 --> 00:31:20,149
I'll just use it as an example there's a
game called Geometry Dash

1838
00:31:20,149 --> 00:31:20,159
game called Geometry Dash
 

1839
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:21,769
game called Geometry Dash
um now I'm not like I'm not world class

1840
00:31:21,769 --> 00:31:21,779
um now I'm not like I'm not world class
 

1841
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:23,149
um now I'm not like I'm not world class

1847
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,250
play just tap and it goes up and down
um people people will probably know what

1848
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:28,260
um people people will probably know what
 

1849
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,409
um people people will probably know what
that is um but like I played that for

1850
00:31:30,409 --> 00:31:30,419
that is um but like I played that for
 

1851
00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:32,269
that is um but like I played that for
maybe like an hour or so I just randomly

1852
00:31:32,269 --> 00:31:32,279
maybe like an hour or so I just randomly
 

1853
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:34,070
maybe like an hour or so I just randomly
placed for one hour and I was terrible

1854
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:34,080
placed for one hour and I was terrible
 

1855
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,049
placed for one hour and I was terrible
at it and I kind of forgot about it

1856
00:31:36,049 --> 00:31:36,059
at it and I kind of forgot about it
 

1857
00:31:36,059 --> 00:31:37,909
at it and I kind of forgot about it
about it for a week and then then I came

1858
00:31:37,909 --> 00:31:37,919
about it for a week and then then I came
 

1859
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:39,590
about it for a week and then then I came
back I saw it on my phone like okay what

at this game so I spent like probably

1864
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:43,380
at this game so I spent like probably
 

1865
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:45,409
at this game so I spent like probably
like 100 hours over the following month

00:31:45,419 --> 00:31:47,750
like 100 hours over the following month
just playing it non-stop over and over

1868
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:47,760
just playing it non-stop over and over
 

1869
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,090
just playing it non-stop over and over
and over again to get to get better at

1870
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:50,100
and over again to get to get better at
 

1871
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,310
and over again to get to get better at
it and again I'm not like world class or

1872
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:52,320
it and again I'm not like world class or
 

1873
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,570
it and again I'm not like world class or
anything but I'm pretty good at the game

1874
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:53,580
anything but I'm pretty good at the game
 

1875
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,549
anything but I'm pretty good at the game
and so with chess is the same thing as

1876
00:31:55,549 --> 00:31:55,559
and so with chess is the same thing as
 

1877
00:31:55,559 --> 00:31:57,110
and so with chess is the same thing as
like when I started out it's like why am

1878
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:57,120
like when I started out it's like why am
 

1879
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,210
like when I started out it's like why am
I not good what am I doing wrong and I

1880
00:31:59,210 --> 00:31:59,220
I not good what am I doing wrong and I
 

1881
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:01,010
I not good what am I doing wrong and I
basically refused to accept that I

1882
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:01,020
basically refused to accept that I
 

1883
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,769
basically refused to accept that I
couldn't be good at the game and so

1884
00:32:03,769 --> 00:32:03,779
couldn't be good at the game and so
 

1885
00:32:03,779 --> 00:32:06,409
couldn't be good at the game and so
um you know at the start I actually I

1886
00:32:06,409 --> 00:32:06,419
um you know at the start I actually I
 

1887
00:32:06,419 --> 00:32:08,510
um you know at the start I actually I
played for a couple of months I did very

1888
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:08,520
played for a couple of months I did very
 

1889
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,769
played for a couple of months I did very
poorly

1890
00:32:09,769 --> 00:32:09,779
poorly
 

1891
00:32:09,779 --> 00:32:11,029
poorly
um and then my parents stopped me from

1892
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:11,039
um and then my parents stopped me from
 

1893
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:13,010
um and then my parents stopped me from
playing for about six months they just

1894
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:13,020
playing for about six months they just
 

1895
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,450
playing for about six months they just
said no you're not playing your brother

1896
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:14,460
said no you're not playing your brother
 

1897
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,190
said no you're not playing your brother
your brother's quite good and my brother

1898
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:16,200
your brother's quite good and my brother
 

1899
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,750
your brother's quite good and my brother
was one of the top ranked players in his

1900
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:17,760
was one of the top ranked players in his
 

1901
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,090
was one of the top ranked players in his
age group in the United States so you're

1902
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:20,100
age group in the United States so you're
 

1903
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,070
age group in the United States so you're
not playing then after about six months

1904
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:22,080
not playing then after about six months
 

1905
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,810
not playing then after about six months
they relented and they let me play in

1906
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:23,820
they relented and they let me play in
 

1907
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,730
they relented and they let me play in
the first tournament back I actually it

1908
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:25,740
the first tournament back I actually it
 

1909
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:26,990
the first tournament back I actually it
was four games I was playing against

1910
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:27,000
was four games I was playing against
 

1911
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,730
was four games I was playing against
other kids and I won the first three

1912
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:28,740
other kids and I won the first three
 

1913
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,350
other kids and I won the first three
games so it was really good and I lost

1914
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:30,360
games so it was really good and I lost
 

1915
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,630
games so it was really good and I lost
the form of Checkmate in the fourth game

1916
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:32,640
the form of Checkmate in the fourth game
 

1917
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,610
the form of Checkmate in the fourth game
um which is of course quite ironic

1918
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:34,620
um which is of course quite ironic
 

1919
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:37,730
um which is of course quite ironic
um how did you yeah oh I guess this is

1920
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:37,740
um how did you yeah oh I guess this is
 

1921
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,289
um how did you yeah oh I guess this is
how old were you at this time I would

1922
00:32:39,289 --> 00:32:39,299
how old were you at this time I would
 

1923
00:32:39,299 --> 00:32:41,450
how old were you at this time I would
have been about eight years old seven or

1924
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:41,460
have been about eight years old seven or
 

1925
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:45,289
have been about eight years old seven or
eight so an eight-year-old future top

1926
00:32:45,289 --> 00:32:45,299
eight so an eight-year-old future top
 

1927
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:47,450
eight so an eight-year-old future top
ranked chess player has so it's great to

1928
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:47,460
ranked chess player has so it's great to
 

1929
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,669
ranked chess player has so it's great to
know that that somebody has lost to that

1930
00:32:49,669 --> 00:32:49,679
know that that somebody has lost to that
 

1931
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:51,710
know that that somebody has lost to that
Checkmate so it's possible to lose that

1932
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:51,720
Checkmate so it's possible to lose that
 

1933
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,810
Checkmate so it's possible to lose that
Checkmate yes I I remember that game

1934
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:53,820
Checkmate yes I I remember that game
 

1935
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:55,909
Checkmate yes I I remember that game
quite well yeah was it I mean at that

1936
00:32:55,909 --> 00:32:55,919
quite well yeah was it I mean at that
 

1937
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:58,730
quite well yeah was it I mean at that
time did you know that that Checkmate

1938
00:32:58,730 --> 00:32:58,740
time did you know that that Checkmate
 

1939
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,230
time did you know that that Checkmate
exists obviously I mean I think I

1940
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:00,240
exists obviously I mean I think I
 

1941
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,210
exists obviously I mean I think I
probably knew it existed but I didn't I

1942
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:02,220
probably knew it existed but I didn't I
 

1943
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:04,070
probably knew it existed but I didn't I
was just playing like it's a completely

1944
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:04,080
was just playing like it's a completely
 

1945
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,750
was just playing like it's a completely
different world than now if a kid goes

1946
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:05,760
different world than now if a kid goes
 

1947
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,070
different world than now if a kid goes
on their computer they can immediately

1948
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:07,080
on their computer they can immediately
 

1949
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,049
on their computer they can immediately
figure out what are the basic checkmates

1950
00:33:09,049 --> 00:33:09,059
figure out what are the basic checkmates
 

1951
00:33:09,059 --> 00:33:10,730
figure out what are the basic checkmates
all these different things at the time

1952
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:10,740
all these different things at the time
 

1953
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,710
all these different things at the time
that didn't really exist you'd have to

1954
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:12,720
that didn't really exist you'd have to
 

1955
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,750
that didn't really exist you'd have to
find it in a book yeah so this is just a

1956
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:14,760
find it in a book yeah so this is just a
 

1957
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,450
find it in a book yeah so this is just a
basic blunder yeah exactly cool yeah so

1958
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:17,460
basic blunder yeah exactly cool yeah so
 

1959
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,649
basic blunder yeah exactly cool yeah so
it's like I came back it was a very good

1960
00:33:18,649 --> 00:33:18,659
it's like I came back it was a very good
 

1961
00:33:18,659 --> 00:33:20,450
it's like I came back it was a very good
start and then I Then I then I lose like

1962
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:20,460
start and then I Then I then I lose like
 

1963
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,909
start and then I Then I then I lose like
this but I stuck with it I improved very

1964
00:33:22,909 --> 00:33:22,919
this but I stuck with it I improved very
 

1965
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:24,710
this but I stuck with it I improved very
very quickly thereafter

1966
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:24,720
very quickly thereafter
 

1967
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,690
very quickly thereafter
um and yeah it was very straightforward

1968
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:26,700
um and yeah it was very straightforward
 

1969
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,190
um and yeah it was very straightforward
what was the secret to that fast

1970
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:28,200
what was the secret to that fast
 

1971
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,049
what was the secret to that fast
Improvement so you said

1972
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:30,059
Improvement so you said
 

1973
00:33:30,059 --> 00:33:32,870
Improvement so you said
you said like this very first important

1974
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:32,880
you said like this very first important
 

1975
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,490
you said like this very first important
step which is saying like what am I

1976
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:34,500
step which is saying like what am I
 

1977
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,930
step which is saying like what am I
doing wrong like I have to figure out

1978
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:35,940
doing wrong like I have to figure out
 

1979
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,310
doing wrong like I have to figure out
what I'm doing wrong but then you

1980
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:37,320
what I'm doing wrong but then you
 

1981
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,630
what I'm doing wrong but then you
actually have to take the step before

1982
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:38,640
actually have to take the step before
 

1983
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,310
actually have to take the step before
figuring out what you're doing wrong

1984
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:40,320
figuring out what you're doing wrong
 

1985
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:44,210
figuring out what you're doing wrong
yeah I think it was just I I just I

1986
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:44,220
yeah I think it was just I I just I
 

1987
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:46,130
yeah I think it was just I I just I
played as much as I could like it wasn't

1988
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:46,140
played as much as I could like it wasn't
 

1989
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,630
played as much as I could like it wasn't
like I was consciously thinking about as

1990
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:47,640
like I was consciously thinking about as
 

1991
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,649
like I was consciously thinking about as
an eight-year-old you're not really

1992
00:33:48,649 --> 00:33:48,659
an eight-year-old you're not really
 

1993
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:50,029
an eight-year-old you're not really
thinking about those sorts of things or

1994
00:33:50,029 --> 00:33:50,039
thinking about those sorts of things or
 

1995
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:52,909
thinking about those sorts of things or
the big picture so I just basically kept

1996
00:33:52,909 --> 00:33:52,919
the big picture so I just basically kept
 

1997
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:54,110
the big picture so I just basically kept
playing as much as I could whether it

1998
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:54,120
playing as much as I could whether it
 

1999
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,549
playing as much as I could whether it
was online whether it was against my

2000
00:33:55,549 --> 00:33:55,559
was online whether it was against my
 

2001
00:33:55,559 --> 00:33:57,110
was online whether it was against my
brother reading these chess books as

2002
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:57,120
brother reading these chess books as
 

2003
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,090
brother reading these chess books as
much as I could I just devoured as much

2004
00:33:59,090 --> 00:33:59,100
much as I could I just devoured as much
 

2005
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,409
much as I could I just devoured as much
information I was like so you were

2006
00:34:00,409 --> 00:34:00,419
information I was like so you were
 

2007
00:34:00,419 --> 00:34:02,930
information I was like so you were
studying chess books you were I I was I

2008
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:02,940
studying chess books you were I I was I
 

2009
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,250
studying chess books you were I I was I
mean I wasn't studying them cover to

2010
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:04,260
mean I wasn't studying them cover to
 

2011
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,750
mean I wasn't studying them cover to
cover though it's like you just study

2012
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:05,760
cover though it's like you just study
 

2013
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,370
cover though it's like you just study
certain diagrams certain positions the

2014
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:07,380
certain diagrams certain positions the
 

2015
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,990
certain diagrams certain positions the
openings and stuff like that you were uh

2016
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:09,000
openings and stuff like that you were uh
 

2017
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,329
openings and stuff like that you were uh
mostly tactics actually openings were

2018
00:34:11,329 --> 00:34:11,339
mostly tactics actually openings were
 

2019
00:34:11,339 --> 00:34:13,669
mostly tactics actually openings were
not other than top level chess openings

2020
00:34:13,669 --> 00:34:13,679
not other than top level chess openings
 

2021
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,310
not other than top level chess openings
were not a thing probably I want to say

2022
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:16,320
were not a thing probably I want to say
 

2023
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,409
were not a thing probably I want to say
for players below maybe Master Level in

2024
00:34:18,409 --> 00:34:18,419
for players below maybe Master Level in
 

2025
00:34:18,419 --> 00:34:20,329
for players below maybe Master Level in
a serious way until maybe like the early

2026
00:34:20,329 --> 00:34:20,339
a serious way until maybe like the early
 

2027
00:34:20,339 --> 00:34:22,790
a serious way until maybe like the early
2000s so for people who don't know chess

2028
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:22,800
2000s so for people who don't know chess
 

2029
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,190
2000s so for people who don't know chess
what what kind of tactical ideas are

2030
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:25,200
what what kind of tactical ideas are
 

2031
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,470
what what kind of tactical ideas are
interesting and basic to understand that

2032
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:27,480
interesting and basic to understand that
 

2033
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,990
interesting and basic to understand that
once you understand you

2034
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:30,000
once you understand you
 

2035
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,349
once you understand you
you take early leaps in Improvement yeah

2036
00:34:33,349 --> 00:34:33,359
you take early leaps in Improvement yeah
 

2037
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:35,089
you take early leaps in Improvement yeah
so it's things like forks for example

2038
00:34:35,089 --> 00:34:35,099
so it's things like forks for example
 

2039
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:37,250
so it's things like forks for example
where you attack two-piece at the same

2040
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:37,260
where you attack two-piece at the same
 

2041
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,470
where you attack two-piece at the same
time discovered attacks like checkmates

2042
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:39,480
time discovered attacks like checkmates
 

2043
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,990
time discovered attacks like checkmates
and again winning like a queen or other

2044
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:42,000
and again winning like a queen or other
 

2045
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,510
and again winning like a queen or other
material those are probably two most

2046
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:44,520
material those are probably two most
 

2047
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,010
material those are probably two most
important ones

2048
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:46,020
important ones
 

2049
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:48,409
important ones
um batteries or batteries and pins

2050
00:34:48,409 --> 00:34:48,419
um batteries or batteries and pins
 

2051
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:50,450
um batteries or batteries and pins
things of things of that nature how many

2052
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:50,460
things of things of that nature how many
 

2053
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:53,510
things of things of that nature how many
how rich is the world of and by the way

2054
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:53,520
how rich is the world of and by the way
 

2055
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,430
how rich is the world of and by the way
discovered attacks are when you move a

2056
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:55,440
discovered attacks are when you move a
 

2057
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,609
discovered attacks are when you move a
piece and you you put a king in check to

2058
00:34:58,609 --> 00:34:58,619
piece and you you put a king in check to
 

2059
00:34:58,619 --> 00:35:01,070
piece and you you put a king in check to
win like a rook for example or other

2060
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:01,080
win like a rook for example or other
 

2061
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,750
win like a rook for example or other
material and forking pieces is when

2062
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:02,760
material and forking pieces is when
 

2063
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,210
material and forking pieces is when
you're attacking two pieces so obviously

2064
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:05,220
you're attacking two pieces so obviously
 

2065
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,829
you're attacking two pieces so obviously
the other person can't move two pieces

2066
00:35:06,829 --> 00:35:06,839
the other person can't move two pieces
 

2067
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:08,150
the other person can't move two pieces
at a time they're gonna have to lose one

2068
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:08,160
at a time they're gonna have to lose one
 

2069
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:12,109
at a time they're gonna have to lose one
of them okay so how big is the world the

2070
00:35:12,109 --> 00:35:12,119
of them okay so how big is the world the
 

2071
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:14,630
of them okay so how big is the world the
universe of forks and discovered attacks

2072
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:14,640
universe of forks and discovered attacks
 

2073
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,950
universe of forks and discovered attacks
like

2074
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:15,960
like
 

2075
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:19,310
like
um you know I I I I I myself know so

2076
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:19,320
um you know I I I I I myself know so
 

2077
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:23,329
um you know I I I I I myself know so
there's like Knights attacking like uh

2078
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:23,339
there's like Knights attacking like uh
 

2079
00:35:23,339 --> 00:35:25,069
there's like Knights attacking like uh
what is what is their Forks Knight

2080
00:35:25,069 --> 00:35:25,079
what is what is their Forks Knight
 

2081
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:26,450
what is what is their Forks Knight
attacking like a queen in a rook for

2082
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:26,460
attacking like a queen in a rook for
 

2083
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,609
attacking like a queen in a rook for
example like a pawn attacking a queen in

2084
00:35:28,609 --> 00:35:28,619
example like a pawn attacking a queen in
 

2085
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:31,030
example like a pawn attacking a queen in
a rook um or like a rook in a Bishop

2086
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:31,040
a rook um or like a rook in a Bishop
 

2087
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,250
a rook um or like a rook in a Bishop
it's innumerable they're I mean but I

2088
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:34,260
it's innumerable they're I mean but I
 

2089
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:36,050
it's innumerable they're I mean but I
will say that I think that with chess

2090
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:36,060
will say that I think that with chess
 

2091
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:38,329
will say that I think that with chess
the more of these patterns you see the

2092
00:35:38,329 --> 00:35:38,339
the more of these patterns you see the
 

2093
00:35:38,339 --> 00:35:40,190
the more of these patterns you see the
quicker you catch them and that's how

2094
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:40,200
quicker you catch them and that's how
 

2095
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:43,069
quicker you catch them and that's how
you improve I think the the most is by

2096
00:35:43,069 --> 00:35:43,079
you improve I think the the most is by
 

2097
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:45,410
you improve I think the the most is by
learning these basic tactical themes at

2098
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:45,420
learning these basic tactical themes at
 

2099
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:47,930
learning these basic tactical themes at
the beginner levels are you when you're

2100
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:47,940
the beginner levels are you when you're
 

2101
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,609
the beginner levels are you when you're
discovering those patterns are you

2102
00:35:49,609 --> 00:35:49,619
discovering those patterns are you
 

2103
00:35:49,619 --> 00:35:51,290
discovering those patterns are you
looking at the chess board are you

2104
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:51,300
looking at the chess board are you
 

2105
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,630
looking at the chess board are you
looking at some like higher dimensional

2106
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:53,640
looking at some like higher dimensional
 

2107
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,609
looking at some like higher dimensional
representation of the the relative

2108
00:35:55,609 --> 00:35:55,619
representation of the the relative
 

2109
00:35:55,619 --> 00:35:58,130
representation of the the relative
position of the pieces you know so

2110
00:35:58,130 --> 00:35:58,140
position of the pieces you know so
 

2111
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:00,349
position of the pieces you know so
basically something that's disjoint of

2112
00:36:00,349 --> 00:36:00,359
basically something that's disjoint of
 

2113
00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:02,270
basically something that's disjoint of
the particular absolute position of the

2114
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:02,280
the particular absolute position of the
 

2115
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,730
the particular absolute position of the
piece but like you're seeing patterns

2116
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:04,740
piece but like you're seeing patterns
 

2117
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:06,829
piece but like you're seeing patterns
like this kind of pattern but Elsewhere

2118
00:36:06,829 --> 00:36:06,839
like this kind of pattern but Elsewhere
 

2119
00:36:06,839 --> 00:36:08,990
like this kind of pattern but Elsewhere
on the board like yeah are you thinking

2120
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:09,000
on the board like yeah are you thinking
 

2121
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,210
on the board like yeah are you thinking
in patterns or in like absolute

2122
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:11,220
in patterns or in like absolute
 

2123
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:13,609
in patterns or in like absolute
positions of the pieces both I think

2124
00:36:13,609 --> 00:36:13,619
positions of the pieces both I think
 

2125
00:36:13,619 --> 00:36:15,890
positions of the pieces both I think
that at the higher levels you're always

2126
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:15,900
that at the higher levels you're always
 

2127
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,450
that at the higher levels you're always
thinking about like you're thinking

2128
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:17,460
thinking about like you're thinking
 

2129
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,250
thinking about like you're thinking
about the patterns on one side of the

2130
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:19,260
about the patterns on one side of the
 

2131
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,290
about the patterns on one side of the
board specifically but then also what

2132
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:21,300
board specifically but then also what
 

2133
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,730
board specifically but then also what
happens is you play more and more if

2134
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:22,740
happens is you play more and more if
 

2135
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:24,109
happens is you play more and more if
you're a very strong player you will be

2136
00:36:24,109 --> 00:36:24,119
you're a very strong player you will be
 

2137
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:25,609
you're a very strong player you will be
able to remember say Pawn structures

2138
00:36:25,609 --> 00:36:25,619
able to remember say Pawn structures
 

2139
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:27,170
able to remember say Pawn structures
where the pawns are on certain squares

2140
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:27,180
where the pawns are on certain squares
 

2141
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:29,510
where the pawns are on certain squares
from games that you've played like 15 20

2142
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:29,520
from games that you've played like 15 20
 

2143
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,030
from games that you've played like 15 20
years ago even potentially so it's a mix

2144
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:32,040
years ago even potentially so it's a mix
 

2145
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,130
years ago even potentially so it's a mix
I think a lot of it is more subconscious

2146
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:34,140
I think a lot of it is more subconscious
 

2147
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,990
I think a lot of it is more subconscious
than actively thinking about and like

2148
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:36,000
than actively thinking about and like
 

2149
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,970
than actively thinking about and like
figuring it out like that um the only

2150
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:37,980
figuring it out like that um the only
 

2151
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:40,790
figuring it out like that um the only
thing for me that I definitely am doing

2152
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:40,800
thing for me that I definitely am doing
 

2153
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,030
thing for me that I definitely am doing
very frequently when I play is is trying

2154
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:44,040
very frequently when I play is is trying
 

2155
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,730
very frequently when I play is is trying
to look at my pieces are they place on

2156
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:46,740
to look at my pieces are they place on
 

2157
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,109
to look at my pieces are they place on
the optimal squares are there better

2158
00:36:48,109 --> 00:36:48,119
the optimal squares are there better
 

2159
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:50,150
the optimal squares are there better
squares and then once I get past that

2160
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:50,160
squares and then once I get past that
 

2161
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,370
squares and then once I get past that
like using the basic logic I start to

2162
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:52,380
like using the basic logic I start to
 

2163
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,470
like using the basic logic I start to
think about okay what pure calculations

2164
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:54,480
think about okay what pure calculations
 

2165
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,270
think about okay what pure calculations
like what are the moves that make a lot

2166
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:56,280
like what are the moves that make a lot
 

2167
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,770
like what are the moves that make a lot
of sense and start calculating direct

2168
00:36:57,770 --> 00:36:57,780
of sense and start calculating direct
 

2169
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,329
of sense and start calculating direct
moves but one of the most basic things

2170
00:36:59,329 --> 00:36:59,339
moves but one of the most basic things
 

2171
00:36:59,339 --> 00:37:01,010
moves but one of the most basic things
that I think that I do that a lot of

2172
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:01,020
that I think that I do that a lot of
 

2173
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,450
that I think that I do that a lot of
people actually should do that they

2174
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:02,460
people actually should do that they
 

2175
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:04,190
people actually should do that they
don't do is looking at the piece

2176
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:04,200
don't do is looking at the piece
 

2177
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,390
don't do is looking at the piece
placement trying to figure out what

2178
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:05,400
placement trying to figure out what
 

2179
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,890
placement trying to figure out what
pieces look like they're on good squares

2180
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:06,900
pieces look like they're on good squares
 

2181
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,010
pieces look like they're on good squares
versus bad squares

2182
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:09,020
versus bad squares
 

2183
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:12,349
versus bad squares
so am I for each piece asking a question

2184
00:37:12,349 --> 00:37:12,359
so am I for each piece asking a question
 

2185
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:15,530
so am I for each piece asking a question
am I my happy place am I am I like

2186
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:15,540
am I my happy place am I am I like
 

2187
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:17,329
am I my happy place am I am I like
optimally happy place I think that's

2188
00:37:17,329 --> 00:37:17,339
optimally happy place I think that's
 

2189
00:37:17,339 --> 00:37:18,530
optimally happy place I think that's
very important like if we look at this

2190
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:18,540
very important like if we look at this
 

2191
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,730
very important like if we look at this
position on the board right now as a

2192
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:19,740
position on the board right now as a
 

2193
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:21,530
position on the board right now as a
good example who's not in their happy

2194
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:21,540
good example who's not in their happy
 

2195
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,150
good example who's not in their happy
place on the board right now I think

2196
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:23,160
place on the board right now I think
 

2197
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,530
place on the board right now I think
both both sides are actually pretty

2198
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:24,540
both both sides are actually pretty
 

2199
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:27,050
both both sides are actually pretty
happy right now but the thing is if

2200
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:27,060
happy right now but the thing is if
 

2201
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,190
happy right now but the thing is if
you're playing with a black because

2202
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:28,200
you're playing with a black because
 

2203
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,770
you're playing with a black because
there's what is what is a move that

2204
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:30,780
there's what is what is a move that
 

2205
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,210
there's what is what is a move that
sticks out to you to like follow basic

2206
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:32,220
sticks out to you to like follow basic
 

2207
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:33,650
sticks out to you to like follow basic
principles

2208
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:33,660
principles
 

2209
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:36,290
principles
basic principles probably bring out the

2210
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:36,300
basic principles probably bring out the
 

2211
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,150
basic principles probably bring out the
bishop and then Castle the king and

2212
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:38,160
bishop and then Castle the king and
 

2213
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,890
bishop and then Castle the king and
Castle the King right exactly that's

2214
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:39,900
Castle the King right exactly that's
 

2215
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,990
Castle the King right exactly that's
correct and and that's what you should

2216
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:42,000
correct and and that's what you should
 

2217
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,370
correct and and that's what you should
do that's the best way to play the

2218
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:43,380
do that's the best way to play the
 

2219
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:44,450
do that's the best way to play the
position

2220
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:44,460
position
 

2221
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,609
position
um now once you do that by the way I

2222
00:37:46,609 --> 00:37:46,619
um now once you do that by the way I
 

2223
00:37:46,619 --> 00:37:49,190
um now once you do that by the way I
have a vibrating device inside you right

2224
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:49,200
have a vibrating device inside you right
 

2225
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,829
have a vibrating device inside you right
now so I knew that right and so my

2226
00:37:51,829 --> 00:37:51,839
now so I knew that right and so my
 

2227
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:53,750
now so I knew that right and so my
rating is 3400 which is what I believe

2228
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:53,760
rating is 3400 which is what I believe
 

2229
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,510
rating is 3400 which is what I believe
stockfish is higher it's like 3 800

2230
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:56,520
stockfish is higher it's like 3 800
 

2231
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,490
stockfish is higher it's like 3 800
actually is it 38 I think it is I'm

2232
00:37:58,490 --> 00:37:58,500
actually is it 38 I think it is I'm
 

2233
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,050
actually is it 38 I think it is I'm
using an earlier version of stockfish

2234
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:00,060
using an earlier version of stockfish
 

2235
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:02,810
using an earlier version of stockfish
okay anyway sorry you were saying so

2236
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:02,820
okay anyway sorry you were saying so
 

2237
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,910
okay anyway sorry you were saying so
like that's that's very basic but then

2238
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:04,920
like that's that's very basic but then
 

2239
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,589
like that's that's very basic but then
if you move the bishop out and you

2240
00:38:06,589 --> 00:38:06,599
if you move the bishop out and you
 

2241
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:09,050
if you move the bishop out and you
Castle the king let's just say Bishop B7

2242
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:09,060
Castle the king let's just say Bishop B7
 

2243
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:12,310
Castle the king let's just say Bishop B7
play this you Castle

2244
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:12,320
play this you Castle
 

2245
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,690
play this you Castle
okay so now you've done everything with

2246
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:14,700
okay so now you've done everything with
 

2247
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,609
okay so now you've done everything with
the pieces on the king side so what

2248
00:38:16,609 --> 00:38:16,619
the pieces on the king side so what
 

2249
00:38:16,619 --> 00:38:18,890
the pieces on the king side so what
would be the next set of what's the next

2250
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:18,900
would be the next set of what's the next
 

2251
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,690
would be the next set of what's the next
way to try and develop the pieces

2252
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:20,700
way to try and develop the pieces
 

2253
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:23,750
way to try and develop the pieces
so it everything here is pretty strong

2254
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:23,760
so it everything here is pretty strong
 

2255
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,030
so it everything here is pretty strong
except maybe this Pawn I don't know okay

2256
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:26,040
except maybe this Pawn I don't know okay
 

2257
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,589
except maybe this Pawn I don't know okay
but think about the pieces so by piece I

2258
00:38:27,589 --> 00:38:27,599
but think about the pieces so by piece I
 

2259
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,450
but think about the pieces so by piece I
mean everything except the pawns Okay I

2260
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:29,460
mean everything except the pawns Okay I
 

2261
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:32,089
mean everything except the pawns Okay I
accept the pawns okay uh

2262
00:38:32,089 --> 00:38:32,099
accept the pawns okay uh
 

2263
00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:32,790
accept the pawns okay uh
probably

2264
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:32,800
probably
 

2265
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,310
probably
[Music]

2266
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:34,320
[Music]
 

2267
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,609
[Music]
either either bishop or Knight right on

2268
00:38:37,609 --> 00:38:37,619
either either bishop or Knight right on
 

2269
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:39,530
either either bishop or Knight right on
the other side yeah that and that is

2270
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:39,540
the other side yeah that and that is
 

2271
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:40,790
the other side yeah that and that is
correct you want to bring out the bishop

2272
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:40,800
correct you want to bring out the bishop
 

2273
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,670
correct you want to bring out the bishop
in the night let's say you go Bishop E6

2274
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:43,680
in the night let's say you go Bishop E6
 

2275
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,569
in the night let's say you go Bishop E6
yeah

2276
00:38:44,569 --> 00:38:44,579
yeah
 

2277
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:46,010
yeah
all Castle

2278
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:46,020
all Castle
 

2279
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,270
all Castle
now you can move the knights either

2280
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:47,280
now you can move the knights either
 

2281
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,829
now you can move the knights either
Square it's somewhat irrelevant but just

2282
00:38:48,829 --> 00:38:48,839
Square it's somewhat irrelevant but just
 

2283
00:38:48,839 --> 00:38:50,030
Square it's somewhat irrelevant but just
move the Knight

2284
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:50,040
move the Knight
 

2285
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:53,390
move the Knight
I'll just play Knight to C6 what what

2286
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:53,400
I'll just play Knight to C6 what what
 

2287
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:57,170
I'll just play Knight to C6 what what
was your random movement okay oh well

2288
00:38:57,170 --> 00:38:57,180
was your random movement okay oh well
 

2289
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:58,970
was your random movement okay oh well
yeah what's your unhappy place okay so

2290
00:38:58,970 --> 00:38:58,980
yeah what's your unhappy place okay so
 

2291
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,170
yeah what's your unhappy place okay so
let me move the queen to just follow

2292
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:00,180
let me move the queen to just follow
 

2293
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:01,849
let me move the queen to just follow
some base principles okay because I want

2294
00:39:01,849 --> 00:39:01,859
some base principles okay because I want
 

2295
00:39:01,859 --> 00:39:02,990
some base principles okay because I want
to bring my Rooks to the center of the

2296
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:03,000
to bring my Rooks to the center of the
 

2297
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,089
to bring my Rooks to the center of the
board yes so like in this position

2298
00:39:05,089 --> 00:39:05,099
board yes so like in this position
 

2299
00:39:05,099 --> 00:39:06,650
board yes so like in this position
you've pretty much developed all your

2300
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:06,660
you've pretty much developed all your
 

2301
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:08,089
you've pretty much developed all your
pieces they're only two pieces that you

2302
00:39:08,089 --> 00:39:08,099
pieces they're only two pieces that you
 

2303
00:39:08,099 --> 00:39:09,849
pieces they're only two pieces that you
haven't brought into the game

2304
00:39:09,849 --> 00:39:09,859
haven't brought into the game
 

2305
00:39:09,859 --> 00:39:13,430
haven't brought into the game
the the queen and the Rock and The Rook

2306
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:13,440
the the queen and the Rock and The Rook
 

2307
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,589
the the queen and the Rock and The Rook
and this you consider to be in the game

2308
00:39:15,589 --> 00:39:15,599
and this you consider to be in the game
 

2309
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:16,490
and this you consider to be in the game
because

2310
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:16,500
because
 

2311
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,930
because
um I wouldn't say it's it's in the game

2312
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:17,940
um I wouldn't say it's it's in the game
 

2313
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,490
um I wouldn't say it's it's in the game
but there isn't really a great Square

2314
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:19,500
but there isn't really a great Square
 

2315
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,230
but there isn't really a great Square
for that Rook right now

2316
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:21,240
for that Rook right now
 

2317
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,450
for that Rook right now
um but in this position you would

2318
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:23,460
um but in this position you would
 

2319
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,490
um but in this position you would
probably move your Rook to C8

2320
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:25,500
probably move your Rook to C8
 

2321
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,470
probably move your Rook to C8
and then the middle game begins after

2322
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:27,480
and then the middle game begins after
 

2323
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:30,650
and then the middle game begins after
that got it so here because now you've

2324
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:30,660
that got it so here because now you've
 

2325
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,089
that got it so here because now you've
gotten your piece to all the optimal

2326
00:39:32,089 --> 00:39:32,099
gotten your piece to all the optimal
 

2327
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:33,650
gotten your piece to all the optimal
squares and now you have to look for a

2328
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:33,660
squares and now you have to look for a
 

2329
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:35,569
squares and now you have to look for a
specific plan but you have gotten these

2330
00:39:35,569 --> 00:39:35,579
specific plan but you have gotten these
 

2331
00:39:35,579 --> 00:39:36,950
specific plan but you have gotten these
pieces developed

2332
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:36,960
pieces developed
 

2333
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,690
pieces developed
um out of the opening yeah and that's

2334
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:38,700
um out of the opening yeah and that's
 

2335
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,430
um out of the opening yeah and that's
that's like a very basic thing that I

2336
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:40,440
that's like a very basic thing that I
 

2337
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,630
that's like a very basic thing that I
think a lot of people don't think about

2338
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:41,640
think a lot of people don't think about
 

2339
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,670
think a lot of people don't think about
is like what are the optical placements

2340
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:43,680
is like what are the optical placements
 

2341
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,410
is like what are the optical placements
for the pieces so you're constantly

2342
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:45,420
for the pieces so you're constantly
 

2343
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:47,329
for the pieces so you're constantly
thinking about the pieces that are not

2344
00:39:47,329 --> 00:39:47,339
thinking about the pieces that are not
 

2345
00:39:47,339 --> 00:39:49,190
thinking about the pieces that are not
in the optimal placement as you're doing

2346
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:49,200
in the optimal placement as you're doing
 

2347
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,750
in the optimal placement as you're doing
all the other kind of tactics and stuff

2348
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:50,760
all the other kind of tactics and stuff
 

2349
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,190
all the other kind of tactics and stuff
like that but that's a basic thing that

2350
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:52,200
like that but that's a basic thing that
 

2351
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,290
like that but that's a basic thing that
people can follow actually doing pure

2352
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:54,300
people can follow actually doing pure
 

2353
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,150
people can follow actually doing pure
calculations like look moving five or

2354
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:56,160
calculations like look moving five or
 

2355
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,650
calculations like look moving five or
ten moves in your head that's not

2356
00:39:57,650 --> 00:39:57,660
ten moves in your head that's not
 

2357
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:01,010
ten moves in your head that's not
realistic but trying to use basic logic

2358
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:01,020
realistic but trying to use basic logic
 

2359
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,510
realistic but trying to use basic logic
to figure out what pieces look what

2360
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:02,520
to figure out what pieces look what
 

2361
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,430
to figure out what pieces look what
pieces are on squares that look correct

2362
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:04,440
pieces are on squares that look correct
 

2363
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,470
pieces are on squares that look correct
it's something anybody can do what about

2364
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:06,480
it's something anybody can do what about
 

2365
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,470
it's something anybody can do what about
looking at the other person's pieces and

2366
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:09,480
looking at the other person's pieces and
 

2367
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,089
looking at the other person's pieces and
thinking about the optimal placement of

2368
00:40:11,089 --> 00:40:11,099
thinking about the optimal placement of
 

2369
00:40:11,099 --> 00:40:13,430
thinking about the optimal placement of
them like if you see a bunch of pieces

2370
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:13,440
them like if you see a bunch of pieces
 

2371
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,470
them like if you see a bunch of pieces
not in their optimal placement for the

2372
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:15,480
not in their optimal placement for the
 

2373
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,569
not in their optimal placement for the
opponent what does that tell you I mean

2374
00:40:17,569 --> 00:40:17,579
opponent what does that tell you I mean
 

2375
00:40:17,579 --> 00:40:19,190
opponent what does that tell you I mean
that's a higher level concept of course

2376
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:19,200
that's a higher level concept of course
 

2377
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,750
that's a higher level concept of course
that like I'm trying to give a beginner

2378
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:20,760
that like I'm trying to give a beginner
 

2379
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,930
that like I'm trying to give a beginner
example um that is something that I do

2380
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:23,940
example um that is something that I do
 

2381
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:25,250
example um that is something that I do
think about as well like I try to think

2382
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:25,260
think about as well like I try to think
 

2383
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,690
think about as well like I try to think
about my opponent's pieces like that

2384
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:26,700
about my opponent's pieces like that
 

2385
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,609
about my opponent's pieces like that
that is basic logic I think a lot of

2386
00:40:28,609 --> 00:40:28,619
that is basic logic I think a lot of
 

2387
00:40:28,619 --> 00:40:30,710
that is basic logic I think a lot of
people these days at the upper levels of

2388
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:30,720
people these days at the upper levels of
 

2389
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,150
people these days at the upper levels of
Chess they look at the game as something

2390
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:32,160
Chess they look at the game as something
 

2391
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,790
Chess they look at the game as something
of pure calculation and you lose that

2392
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:34,800
of pure calculation and you lose that
 

2393
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,050
of pure calculation and you lose that
human element you're trying to just

2394
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:36,060
human element you're trying to just
 

2395
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:37,490
human element you're trying to just
calculate all these different sequences

2396
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:37,500
calculate all these different sequences
 

2397
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,349
calculate all these different sequences
of moves and you don't think about the

2398
00:40:39,349 --> 00:40:39,359
of moves and you don't think about the
 

2399
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:40,609
of moves and you don't think about the
the basics

2400
00:40:40,609 --> 00:40:40,619
the basics
 

2401
00:40:40,619 --> 00:40:41,990
the basics
um and it's something it'll be

2402
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:42,000
um and it's something it'll be
 

2403
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,670
um and it's something it'll be
interesting to see what happens with the

2404
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:43,680
interesting to see what happens with the
 

2405
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,589
interesting to see what happens with the
next generation of kids who become very

2406
00:40:45,589 --> 00:40:45,599
next generation of kids who become very
 

2407
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:47,569
next generation of kids who become very
strong because that is really how they

2408
00:40:47,569 --> 00:40:47,579
strong because that is really how they
 

2409
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:48,710
strong because that is really how they
approach the game they learn with

2410
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:48,720
approach the game they learn with
 

2411
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,870
approach the game they learn with
computers whereas like I learned with

2412
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:50,880
computers whereas like I learned with
 

2413
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,849
computers whereas like I learned with
computers at a certain point but I did

2414
00:40:52,849 --> 00:40:52,859
computers at a certain point but I did
 

2415
00:40:52,859 --> 00:40:54,470
computers at a certain point but I did
not start off with computers from the

2416
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:54,480
not start off with computers from the
 

2417
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,050
not start off with computers from the
get-go so human element still exists in

2418
00:40:57,050 --> 00:40:57,060
get-go so human element still exists in
 

2419
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:58,730
get-go so human element still exists in
my game actually Magnus I think has said

2420
00:40:58,730 --> 00:40:58,740
my game actually Magnus I think has said
 

2421
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:00,589
my game actually Magnus I think has said
this too where he did not use the

2422
00:41:00,589 --> 00:41:00,599
this too where he did not use the
 

2423
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:01,970
this too where he did not use the
computer I think until he was maybe like

2424
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:01,980
computer I think until he was maybe like
 

2425
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,890
computer I think until he was maybe like
11 years old something something around

2426
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:03,900
11 years old something something around
 

2427
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,750
11 years old something something around
there and so we have that human element

2428
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:05,760
there and so we have that human element
 

2429
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,490
there and so we have that human element
to our game that I think the newer

2430
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:07,500
to our game that I think the newer
 

2431
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,990
to our game that I think the newer
generation won't have now it doesn't

2432
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:09,000
generation won't have now it doesn't
 

2433
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,130
generation won't have now it doesn't
mean they aren't going to be better than

2434
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:10,140
mean they aren't going to be better than
 

2435
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,510
mean they aren't going to be better than
us but it's going to be a completely

2436
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:11,520
us but it's going to be a completely
 

2437
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,250
us but it's going to be a completely
different approach what do you mean by

2438
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:13,260
different approach what do you mean by
 

2439
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:15,530
different approach what do you mean by
human elements just basic logic versus

2440
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:15,540
human elements just basic logic versus
 

2441
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:19,190
human elements just basic logic versus
Raw calculation so it's like anybody now

2442
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:19,200
Raw calculation so it's like anybody now
 

2443
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,810
Raw calculation so it's like anybody now
will use the computer from the time they

2444
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:20,820
will use the computer from the time they
 

2445
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:22,609
will use the computer from the time they
start the game and and you use the

2446
00:41:22,609 --> 00:41:22,619
start the game and and you use the
 

2447
00:41:22,619 --> 00:41:24,170
start the game and and you use the
computer you look at the evaluations

2448
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:24,180
computer you look at the evaluations
 

2449
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:26,569
computer you look at the evaluations
after the game to see how you're doing

2450
00:41:26,569 --> 00:41:26,579
after the game to see how you're doing
 

2451
00:41:26,579 --> 00:41:28,730
after the game to see how you're doing
but you if you don't really ever have

2452
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:28,740
but you if you don't really ever have
 

2453
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:30,829
but you if you don't really ever have
those moments where you're just it's you

2454
00:41:30,829 --> 00:41:30,839
those moments where you're just it's you
 

2455
00:41:30,839 --> 00:41:32,750
those moments where you're just it's you
or it's just you and your opponent one

2456
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:32,760
or it's just you and your opponent one
 

2457
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,950
or it's just you and your opponent one
thing that was great in the old days

2458
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:33,960
thing that was great in the old days
 

2459
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:36,410
thing that was great in the old days
before computers simply became too

2460
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:36,420
before computers simply became too
 

2461
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:37,790
before computers simply became too
strong is that you would actually do

2462
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:37,800
strong is that you would actually do
 

2463
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,530
strong is that you would actually do
analysis with your opponent after the

2464
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:39,540
analysis with your opponent after the
 

2465
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:41,569
analysis with your opponent after the
game and that's very much this two

2466
00:41:41,569 --> 00:41:41,579
game and that's very much this two
 

2467
00:41:41,579 --> 00:41:43,790
game and that's very much this two
humans analyzing game it's you and your

2468
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:43,800
humans analyzing game it's you and your
 

2469
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,670
humans analyzing game it's you and your
opponent two peers and you come up with

2470
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:46,680
opponent two peers and you come up with
 

2471
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,410
opponent two peers and you come up with
these human ideas it's not automatically

2472
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:48,420
these human ideas it's not automatically
 

2473
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:49,970
these human ideas it's not automatically
run back to your room look with a

2474
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:49,980
run back to your room look with a
 

2475
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:51,349
run back to your room look with a
computer on oh I should have played this

2476
00:41:51,349 --> 00:41:51,359
computer on oh I should have played this
 

2477
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:52,810
computer on oh I should have played this
move and it's just like winning the game

2478
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:52,820
move and it's just like winning the game
 

2479
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:55,430
move and it's just like winning the game
so that is kind of something that has

2480
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:55,440
so that is kind of something that has
 

2481
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,890
so that is kind of something that has
that no longer exists um in the game of

2482
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:57,900
that no longer exists um in the game of
 

2483
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,630
that no longer exists um in the game of

2553
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:11,210
sense because it doesn't we just know
that it's fine because the computer says

2554
00:43:11,210 --> 00:43:11,220
that it's fine because the computer says
 

2555
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:13,190
that it's fine because the computer says
it's fine it's fine or is it good it's

it's fine it's fine or is it good it's
 

2557

just fine it can it probably like
 

2559
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,450
just fine it can it probably like

00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:30,900
forward uh maybe maybe I can put the
 

2575
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,569
forward uh maybe maybe I can put the
bishop on G5 and in some position the

2576
00:43:32,569 --> 00:43:32,579
bishop on G5 and in some position the
 

2577
00:43:32,579 --> 00:43:34,790
bishop on G5 and in some position the
pawn guards the bishop but I can't give

2579
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,309
pawn guards the bishop but I can't give
like an actual good explanation for why

2580
00:43:37,309 --> 00:43:37,319
like an actual good explanation for why
 

2581
00:43:37,319 --> 00:43:38,690
like an actual good explanation for why
it's a move that makes sense because it

2582
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:38,700
it's a move that makes sense because it
 

2583
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:40,309
it's a move that makes sense because it
doesn't make sense it's fascinating that

young people today kids these days would

2586
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:42,900
young people today kids these days would
 

2587
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:46,930
young people today kids these days would
probably do that move much more uh

2588
00:43:46,930 --> 00:43:46,940
probably do that move much more uh
 

2589
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:49,250
probably do that move much more uh
nonchalantly you'll see that a lot more

2590
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:49,260
nonchalantly you'll see that a lot more
 

2591
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:50,630
nonchalantly you'll see that a lot more
because they know it's safe at least

2592
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:50,640
because they know it's safe at least
 

2593
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,309
because they know it's safe at least
right because I know the computer says

2594
00:43:52,309 --> 00:43:52,319
right because I know the computer says
 

2595
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:53,510
right because I know the computer says
it's fine but I grew up without

2596
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:53,520
it's fine but I grew up without
 

2597
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,550
it's fine but I grew up without
computers and so to me as you're pushing

2598
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:55,560
computers and so to me as you're pushing
 

2599
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,170
computers and so to me as you're pushing
a Pawn on the edge it's the opening

2600
00:43:57,170 --> 00:43:57,180
a Pawn on the edge it's the opening
 

2601
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:59,150
a Pawn on the edge it's the opening
phase you don't do things like this it's

2602
00:43:59,150 --> 00:43:59,160
phase you don't do things like this it's
 

2603
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:01,970
phase you don't do things like this it's
just it looks ridiculous now of course I

2604
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:01,980
just it looks ridiculous now of course I
 

2605
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:03,770
just it looks ridiculous now of course I
have worked with computers long enough

2606
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:03,780
have worked with computers long enough
 

2607
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:07,309
have worked with computers long enough
that I know like I'm not I I know the

2608
00:44:07,309 --> 00:44:07,319
that I know like I'm not I I know the
 

2609
00:44:07,319 --> 00:44:09,650
that I know like I'm not I I know the
computers are um computers prove that

2610
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:09,660
computers are um computers prove that
 

2611
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:12,170
computers are um computers prove that
that everything is fine but still to me

2612
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:12,180
that everything is fine but still to me
 

2613
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:15,290
that everything is fine but still to me
it does feel wrong yeah well I think as

2614
00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:15,300
it does feel wrong yeah well I think as
 

2615
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:16,970
it does feel wrong yeah well I think as
computers get better they'll also get

2616
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:16,980
computers get better they'll also get
 

2617
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:18,170
computers get better they'll also get
better at explaining which they

2618
00:44:18,170 --> 00:44:18,180
better at explaining which they
 

2619
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:21,470
better at explaining which they
currently don't do at basically being

2620
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:21,480
currently don't do at basically being

that out yourself like why what's the
 

2637
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:44,329
that out yourself like why what's the
Deep wisdom in this particular Pawn

2638
00:44:44,329 --> 00:44:44,339
Deep wisdom in this particular Pawn
 

2639
00:44:44,339 --> 00:44:46,309
Deep wisdom in this particular Pawn
coming out in this kind of way let me

2640
00:44:46,309 --> 00:44:46,319
coming out in this kind of way let me
 

2641
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:49,390
coming out in this kind of way let me
ask you uh a ridiculous question

2642
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:49,400
ask you uh a ridiculous question
 

2643
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:52,010
ask you uh a ridiculous question
do you think chess will ever get solved

2644
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:52,020
do you think chess will ever get solved
 

2645
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:54,530
do you think chess will ever get solved
from the opening position to where we'll

2646
00:44:54,530 --> 00:44:54,540
from the opening position to where we'll
 

2647
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:57,950
from the opening position to where we'll
know the optimal optimal level of play I

2648
00:44:57,950 --> 00:44:57,960
know the optimal optimal level of play I
 

2649
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,510
know the optimal optimal level of play I
highly doubt it

2650
00:44:59,510 --> 00:44:59,520
highly doubt it
 

2651
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,910
highly doubt it
um without major advances in Quantum

2652
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:01,920
um without major advances in Quantum
 

2653
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,710
um without major advances in Quantum
Computing I don't think it's realistic

2654
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:03,720
Computing I don't think it's realistic
 

2655
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:06,470
Computing I don't think it's realistic
to expect chess to be hard solved I just

2656
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:06,480
to expect chess to be hard solved I just
 

2657
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,870
to expect chess to be hard solved I just
I don't think that will happen

2658
00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:08,880
I don't think that will happen
 

2659
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,630
I don't think that will happen
um but I I don't know it could happen 20

2660
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:11,640
um but I I don't know it could happen 20
 

2661
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,490
um but I I don't know it could happen 20
30 years maybe but I think in the near

2662
00:45:13,490 --> 00:45:13,500
30 years maybe but I think in the near
 

2663
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,530
30 years maybe but I think in the near
future it's not not realistic well then

2664
00:45:15,530 --> 00:45:15,540
future it's not not realistic well then
 

2665
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:17,450
future it's not not realistic well then
let's go up with the pothead follow-up

2666
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:17,460
let's go up with the pothead follow-up
 

2667
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:20,990
let's go up with the pothead follow-up
question suppose it does get solved what

2668
00:45:20,990 --> 00:45:21,000
question suppose it does get solved what
 

2669
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,750
question suppose it does get solved what
opening do you think will be the optimal

2670
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:23,760
opening do you think will be the optimal
 

2671
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,390
opening do you think will be the optimal
well everything will be a draw for sure

2672
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:26,400
well everything will be a draw for sure
 

2673
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,030
well everything will be a draw for sure
after for sure after move one yes for

2674
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:29,040
after for sure after move one yes for
 

2675
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,349
after for sure after move one yes for
sure absolutely you're absolutely sure

2676
00:45:30,349 --> 00:45:30,359
sure absolutely you're absolutely sure
 

2677
00:45:30,359 --> 00:45:33,170
sure absolutely you're absolutely sure
of that yes yeah that's what why are you

2678
00:45:33,170 --> 00:45:33,180
of that yes yeah that's what why are you
 

2679
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:35,870
of that yes yeah that's what why are you
so sure I'm so sure because when you

2680
00:45:35,870 --> 00:45:35,880
so sure I'm so sure because when you
 

2681
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,430
so sure I'm so sure because when you
look at the computer games you see these

2682
00:45:37,430 --> 00:45:37,440
look at the computer games you see these
 

2683
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,710
look at the computer games you see these
decisive results it's because they

2684
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:39,720
decisive results it's because they
 

2685
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:41,569
decisive results it's because they
played the openings are set generally

2686
00:45:41,569 --> 00:45:41,579
played the openings are set generally
 

2687
00:45:41,579 --> 00:45:43,550
played the openings are set generally
they can't they can't for move one they

2688
00:45:43,550 --> 00:45:43,560
they can't they can't for move one they
 

2689
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:44,990
they can't they can't for move one they
Place set opens like you might play the

2690
00:45:44,990 --> 00:45:45,000
Place set opens like you might play the
 

2691
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,430
Place set opens like you might play the
Knight or you might play the Berlin

2692
00:45:46,430 --> 00:45:46,440
Knight or you might play the Berlin
 

2693
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:48,770
Knight or you might play the Berlin
defense normally it's set openings as

2694
00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:48,780
defense normally it's set openings as
 

2695
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:50,030
defense normally it's set openings as
opposed to

2696
00:45:50,030 --> 00:45:50,040
opposed to
 

2697
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,530
opposed to
um as opposed to computers being able to

2698
00:45:51,530 --> 00:45:51,540
um as opposed to computers being able to
 

2699
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:53,390
um as opposed to computers being able to
do whatever they want I just believe in

2700
00:45:53,390 --> 00:45:53,400
do whatever they want I just believe in
 

2701
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:56,089
do whatever they want I just believe in
general when the openings that are

2702
00:45:56,089 --> 00:45:56,099
general when the openings that are
 

2703
00:45:56,099 --> 00:46:00,530
general when the openings that are
symmetrical like E4 E5 D4 D5 uh the

2704
00:46:00,530 --> 00:46:00,540
symmetrical like E4 E5 D4 D5 uh the
 

2705
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:02,089
symmetrical like E4 E5 D4 D5 uh the
computers will draw and I think the

2706
00:46:02,089 --> 00:46:02,099
computers will draw and I think the
 

2707
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:05,210
computers will draw and I think the
optimal opening I think E4 E5 Knight F3

2708
00:46:05,210 --> 00:46:05,220
optimal opening I think E4 E5 Knight F3
 

2709
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:07,910
optimal opening I think E4 E5 Knight F3
Knight F6 is probably a guaranteed draw

2710
00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:07,920
Knight F6 is probably a guaranteed draw
 

2711
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,890
Knight F6 is probably a guaranteed draw
if there is perfect if we have perfect

2712
00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:09,900
if there is perfect if we have perfect
 

2713
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:12,050
if there is perfect if we have perfect
information and we know that that

2714
00:46:12,050 --> 00:46:12,060
information and we know that that
 

2715
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:14,510
information and we know that that
chassis solved e45 Knight F3 Knight F6

2716
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:14,520
chassis solved e45 Knight F3 Knight F6
 

2717
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,849
chassis solved e45 Knight F3 Knight F6
the Russian or the Petrov defense that

2718
00:46:16,849 --> 00:46:16,859
the Russian or the Petrov defense that
 

2719
00:46:16,859 --> 00:46:19,010
the Russian or the Petrov defense that
that will be the optimal strategy see so

2720
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:19,020
that will be the optimal strategy see so
 

2721
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:21,550
that will be the optimal strategy see so
that's sure of that symmetrical play

2722
00:46:21,550 --> 00:46:21,560
that's sure of that symmetrical play
 

2723
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:25,490
that's sure of that symmetrical play
is going to lead to a draw but what if

2724
00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:25,500
is going to lead to a draw but what if
 

2725
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:28,250
is going to lead to a draw but what if
you can constantly as white maintain

2726
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:28,260
you can constantly as white maintain
 

2727
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:30,890
you can constantly as white maintain
asymmetry constantly keep the opponent

2728
00:46:30,890 --> 00:46:30,900
asymmetry constantly keep the opponent
 

2729
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:34,490
asymmetry constantly keep the opponent
off balance so yes E4 then then you're

2730
00:46:34,490 --> 00:46:34,500
off balance so yes E4 then then you're
 

2731
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:35,990
off balance so yes E4 then then you're
all you're always doing this symmetry

2732
00:46:35,990 --> 00:46:36,000
all you're always doing this symmetry
 

2733
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,030
all you're always doing this symmetry
but what if chess inherently there's

2734
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:38,040
but what if chess inherently there's
 

2735
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:39,530
but what if chess inherently there's
something about the mathematics of the

2736
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:39,540
something about the mathematics of the
 

2737
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:41,690
something about the mathematics of the
game that allows

2738
00:46:41,690 --> 00:46:41,700
game that allows
 

2739
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:45,109
game that allows
for like that thin line that you walk

2740
00:46:45,109 --> 00:46:45,119
for like that thin line that you walk
 

2741
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:47,390
for like that thin line that you walk
that maintains to the end game the

2742
00:46:47,390 --> 00:46:47,400
that maintains to the end game the
 

2743
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:50,030
that maintains to the end game the
asymmetry constantly that there's no

2744
00:46:50,030 --> 00:46:50,040
asymmetry constantly that there's no
 

2745
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,790
asymmetry constantly that there's no
move that can

2746
00:46:51,790 --> 00:46:51,800
move that can
 

2747
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:54,950
move that can
uh bring bring back the balance of the

2748
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:54,960
uh bring bring back the balance of the
 

2749
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:55,730
uh bring bring back the balance of the
game

2750
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:55,740
game
 

2751
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:58,190
game
yeah I I don't think that exists I don't

2752
00:46:58,190 --> 00:46:58,200
yeah I I don't think that exists I don't
 

2753
00:46:58,200 --> 00:46:59,630
yeah I I don't think that exists I don't
think it does so basically I'm saying E4

2754
00:46:59,630 --> 00:46:59,640
think it does so basically I'm saying E4
 

2755
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:01,970
think it does so basically I'm saying E4
E5 I think is a draw I think D4 D5 is a

2756
00:47:01,970 --> 00:47:01,980
E5 I think is a draw I think D4 D5 is a
 

2757
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:04,609
E5 I think is a draw I think D4 D5 is a
draw C4 C5 I think I think basically

2758
00:47:04,609 --> 00:47:04,619
draw C4 C5 I think I think basically
 

2759
00:47:04,619 --> 00:47:06,950
draw C4 C5 I think I think basically
symmetry that's all of it's a draw I

2760
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:06,960
symmetry that's all of it's a draw I
 

2761
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,390
symmetry that's all of it's a draw I
think that's that's why it's a draw so

2762
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:08,400
think that's that's why it's a draw so
 

2763
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,950
think that's that's why it's a draw so
it doesn't even matter like you're

2764
00:47:09,950 --> 00:47:09,960
it doesn't even matter like you're
 

2765
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,470
it doesn't even matter like you're
saying one if it's solved

2766
00:47:12,470 --> 00:47:12,480
saying one if it's solved
 

2767
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:16,309
saying one if it's solved
most openings will be a draw yes I think

2768
00:47:16,309 --> 00:47:16,319
most openings will be a draw yes I think
 

2769
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:19,130
most openings will be a draw yes I think
E4 D4 C4 and Knight F3 for sure will be

2770
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:19,140
E4 D4 C4 and Knight F3 for sure will be
 

2771
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:21,290
E4 D4 C4 and Knight F3 for sure will be
a draw other openings I'm not sure about

2772
00:47:21,290 --> 00:47:21,300
a draw other openings I'm not sure about
 

2773
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:23,990
a draw other openings I'm not sure about
but those first four uh possible

2774
00:47:23,990 --> 00:47:24,000
but those first four uh possible
 

2775
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,089
but those first four uh possible
starting moves I think chess is a draw

2776
00:47:26,089 --> 00:47:26,099
starting moves I think chess is a draw
 

2777
00:47:26,099 --> 00:47:28,670
starting moves I think chess is a draw
Knight F3 what's the response to Knight

2778
00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:28,680
Knight F3 what's the response to Knight
 

2779
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:29,870
Knight F3 what's the response to Knight
F3

2780
00:47:29,870 --> 00:47:29,880
F3
 

2781
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:32,750
F3
um probably a knight F6 again or

2782
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:32,760
um probably a knight F6 again or
 

2783
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,329
um probably a knight F6 again or
to make it simple

2784
00:47:34,329 --> 00:47:34,339
to make it simple
 

2785
00:47:34,339 --> 00:47:37,790
to make it simple
if I play Knight A3 on move one

2786
00:47:37,790 --> 00:47:37,800
if I play Knight A3 on move one
 

2787
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:40,730
if I play Knight A3 on move one
um black here can also play D5

2788
00:47:40,730 --> 00:47:40,740
um black here can also play D5
 

2789
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:42,829
um black here can also play D5
I'll move one and normally at some point

2790
00:47:42,829 --> 00:47:42,839
I'll move one and normally at some point
 

2791
00:47:42,839 --> 00:47:44,870
I'll move one and normally at some point
White's gonna end up playing D4 so the

2792
00:47:44,870 --> 00:47:44,880
White's gonna end up playing D4 so the
 

2793
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,849
White's gonna end up playing D4 so the
order of so it's probably going to lead

2794
00:47:46,849 --> 00:47:46,859
order of so it's probably going to lead
 

2795
00:47:46,859 --> 00:47:49,069
order of so it's probably going to lead
back yeah all roads kind of lead back

2796
00:47:49,069 --> 00:47:49,079
back yeah all roads kind of lead back
 

2797
00:47:49,079 --> 00:47:50,270
back yeah all roads kind of lead back
there as well there probably are other

2798
00:47:50,270 --> 00:47:50,280
there as well there probably are other
 

2799
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:51,710
there as well there probably are other
ways which

2800
00:47:51,710 --> 00:47:51,720
ways which
 

2801
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:53,870
ways which
um where there is play but I think

2802
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:53,880
um where there is play but I think
 

2803
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:55,190
um where there is play but I think
that's at the end of the day the

2804
00:47:55,190 --> 00:47:55,200
that's at the end of the day the
 

2805
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,349
that's at the end of the day the
Symmetry is symmetry is what's going to

2806
00:47:57,349 --> 00:47:57,359
Symmetry is symmetry is what's going to
 

2807
00:47:57,359 --> 00:47:59,569
Symmetry is symmetry is what's going to
lead lead to like a forced Force

2808
00:47:59,569 --> 00:47:59,579
lead lead to like a forced Force
 

2809
00:47:59,579 --> 00:48:01,849
lead lead to like a forced Force

says uh the reason
 

2823
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:18,950
says uh the reason
his hypothesis is that the reason chess

2824
00:48:18,950 --> 00:48:18,960
his hypothesis is that the reason chess
 

2825
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:23,230

is interesting as a game is the creative

quote-unquote tension between the bishop

2828
00:48:26,089 --> 00:48:26,099
quote-unquote tension between the bishop
 

2829
00:48:26,099 --> 00:48:27,230
quote-unquote tension between the bishop
and the Knight

2830
00:48:27,230 --> 00:48:27,240
and the Knight
 

2831
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:29,569
and the Knight
so like there's uh so many different

2832
00:48:29,569 --> 00:48:29,579
so like there's uh so many different
 

2833
00:48:29,579 --> 00:48:31,790
so like there's uh so many different
dynamics that are created by those two

2834
00:48:31,790 --> 00:48:31,800
dynamics that are created by those two
 

2835
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,770
dynamics that are created by those two
pieces you think there's truth to that I

2836
00:48:33,770 --> 00:48:33,780
pieces you think there's truth to that I
 

2837
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:35,630
pieces you think there's truth to that I
mean some of that is just poetry but uh

2838
00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:35,640
mean some of that is just poetry but uh
 

2839
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,069
mean some of that is just poetry but uh
is there I think it's I think it's

2840
00:48:37,069 --> 00:48:37,079
is there I think it's I think it's
 

2841
00:48:37,079 --> 00:48:38,630
is there I think it's I think it's
definitely true when you look at the

2842
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:38,640
definitely true when you look at the
 

2843
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,670
definitely true when you look at the
imbalances that are not like crazy

2844
00:48:40,670 --> 00:48:40,680
imbalances that are not like crazy
 

2845
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:42,890

attacking Physicians like one thing that

2846
00:48:42,890 --> 00:48:42,900
attacking Physicians like one thing that
 

2847
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:44,690
attacking Physicians like one thing that
Bobby Fischer was really really good at

2848
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:44,700
Bobby Fischer was really really good at
 

2849
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:46,250
Bobby Fischer was really really good at
when he was a world champion is playing

2850
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:46,260
when he was a world champion is playing
 

2851
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:47,990
when he was a world champion is playing
end games with a bishop versus the

2852
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:48,000
end games with a bishop versus the
 

2853
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,370
end games with a bishop versus the
Knight now traditionally we think of the

2854
00:48:49,370 --> 00:48:49,380
Knight now traditionally we think of the
 

2855
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:50,690
Knight now traditionally we think of the
Knight being better than the bishop even

2856
00:48:50,690 --> 00:48:50,700
Knight being better than the bishop even
 

2857
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:53,210
Knight being better than the bishop even
today in end games but Fisher proved

2858
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:53,220
today in end games but Fisher proved
 

2859
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:54,410
today in end games but Fisher proved
that there are a lot of end games where

2860
00:48:54,410 --> 00:48:54,420
that there are a lot of end games where
 

2861
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:56,450
that there are a lot of end games where
Bishop is better than a knight so I do

2862
00:48:56,450 --> 00:48:56,460
Bishop is better than a knight so I do
 

2863
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:58,130
Bishop is better than a knight so I do
agree with that statement

2864
00:48:58,130 --> 00:48:58,140
agree with that statement
 

2865
00:48:58,140 --> 00:48:59,750
agree with that statement
it's like the imbalances between like

2866
00:48:59,750 --> 00:48:59,760
it's like the imbalances between like
 

2867
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,370
it's like the imbalances between like
Bishops and knights and in many

2868
00:49:01,370 --> 00:49:01,380
Bishops and knights and in many
 

2869
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:03,109
Bishops and knights and in many
positions you never really know like

2870
00:49:03,109 --> 00:49:03,119
positions you never really know like
 

2871
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:04,309
positions you never really know like
there are many positions where a knight

2872
00:49:04,309 --> 00:49:04,319
there are many positions where a knight
 

2873
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:05,690
there are many positions where a knight
is better than a bishop or Knight and

2874
00:49:05,690 --> 00:49:05,700
is better than a bishop or Knight and
 

2875
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:07,970
is better than a bishop or Knight and
Bishop are better than uh two Bishops or

2876
00:49:07,970 --> 00:49:07,980
Bishop are better than uh two Bishops or
 

2877
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:10,069
Bishop are better than uh two Bishops or
like it is all the inbound generally it

2878
00:49:10,069 --> 00:49:10,079
like it is all the inbound generally it
 

2879
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:11,930
like it is all the inbound generally it
is the imbalances though

2880
00:49:11,930 --> 00:49:11,940
is the imbalances though
 

2881
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:13,309
is the imbalances though
um between the Bishops and the Knights

2882
00:49:13,309 --> 00:49:13,319
um between the Bishops and the Knights
 

2883
00:49:13,319 --> 00:49:15,290
um between the Bishops and the Knights
or combinations of the two pieces that

2884
00:49:15,290 --> 00:49:15,300
or combinations of the two pieces that
 

2885
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:17,030
or combinations of the two pieces that
they lead to the most interesting

2886
00:49:17,030 --> 00:49:17,040
they lead to the most interesting
 

2887
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,010
they lead to the most interesting
positions so I I agree with interesting

2888
00:49:19,010 --> 00:49:19,020
positions so I I agree with interesting
 

2889
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:20,809
positions so I I agree with interesting
positions what about fun is there like

2890
00:49:20,809 --> 00:49:20,819
positions what about fun is there like
 

2891
00:49:20,819 --> 00:49:23,390
positions what about fun is there like
aspects that you'll find fun within the

2892
00:49:23,390 --> 00:49:23,400
aspects that you'll find fun within the
 

2893
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:26,210
aspects that you'll find fun within the
game itself not all the stuff around it

2894
00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:26,220
game itself not all the stuff around it
 

2895
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:29,870
game itself not all the stuff around it
but just the the purity of the game I

2896
00:49:29,870 --> 00:49:29,880
but just the the purity of the game I
 

2897
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:32,750
but just the the purity of the game I
think for me these days when I see some

2898
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:32,760
think for me these days when I see some
 

2899
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:34,430
think for me these days when I see some
of these moves that computer suggests

2900
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:34,440
of these moves that computer suggests
 

2901
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:35,930
of these moves that computer suggests
after a game that I play and I just go

2902
00:49:35,930 --> 00:49:35,940
after a game that I play and I just go
 

2903
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:38,030
after a game that I play and I just go
wow that is the beauty for me because

2904
00:49:38,030 --> 00:49:38,040
wow that is the beauty for me because
 

2905
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:39,530
wow that is the beauty for me because
these are not moves that I would ever

2906
00:49:39,530 --> 00:49:39,540
these are not moves that I would ever
 

2907
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:41,630
these are not moves that I would ever
consider and when when I then see the

2908
00:49:41,630 --> 00:49:41,640
consider and when when I then see the
 

2909
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:42,829
consider and when when I then see the
move and then like I might make a couple

2910
00:49:42,829 --> 00:49:42,839
move and then like I might make a couple
 

2911
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:44,750
move and then like I might make a couple
of moves to try and understand why that

2912
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:44,760
of moves to try and understand why that
 

2913
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:46,550
of moves to try and understand why that
is the beauty to me is seeing all these

2914
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:46,560
is the beauty to me is seeing all these
 

2915
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:48,770
is the beauty to me is seeing all these
things that just like 10 years ago I

2916
00:49:48,770 --> 00:49:48,780
things that just like 10 years ago I
 

2917
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:50,089
things that just like 10 years ago I
never would have even seen because

2918
00:49:50,089 --> 00:49:50,099
never would have even seen because
 

2919
00:49:50,099 --> 00:49:51,410
never would have even seen because
computers weren't at the level they're

2920
00:49:51,410 --> 00:49:51,420
computers weren't at the level they're
 

2921
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:53,870
computers weren't at the level they're
at today and so the depth and creativity

2922
00:49:53,870 --> 00:49:53,880
at today and so the depth and creativity
 

2923
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:55,730
at today and so the depth and creativity
of what they're saying even even if it's

2924
00:49:55,730 --> 00:49:55,740
of what they're saying even even if it's
 

2925
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:57,290
of what they're saying even even if it's
not like in our language but in the in

2926

not like in our language but in the in
 

2927
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:59,510
not like in our language but in the in
the evaluation that's where I find a lot

2928
00:49:59,510 --> 00:49:59,520
the evaluation that's where I find a lot
 

2929
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,250
the evaluation that's where I find a lot
of beauty oh that's that's fun so like

2930
00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:01,260
of beauty oh that's that's fun so like
 

2931
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:04,250
of beauty oh that's that's fun so like
the the computer's a source it's a

2932
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:04,260
the the computer's a source it's a
 

2933
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:06,829
the the computer's a source it's a
source of uh creative fulfillment for

2934
00:50:06,829 --> 00:50:06,839
source of uh creative fulfillment for
 

2935
00:50:06,839 --> 00:50:08,690
source of uh creative fulfillment for
you absolutely

2936
00:50:08,690 --> 00:50:08,700

for Magnus I think when we look at it
and you see like these things that we've

2950
00:50:20,089 --> 00:50:20,099
and you see like these things that we've
 

2951
00:50:20,099 --> 00:50:22,609
and you see like these things that we've
spent 20 30 years playing this game and

2952
00:50:22,609 --> 00:50:22,619
spent 20 30 years playing this game and
 

2953
00:50:22,619 --> 00:50:24,410
spent 20 30 years playing this game and
it just it doesn't click and then you

2954
00:50:24,410 --> 00:50:24,420
it just it doesn't click and then you
 

2955
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:25,790
it just it doesn't click and then you
see it it's just like it really is

2956
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:25,800
see it it's just like it really is
 

2957
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:26,870
see it it's just like it really is
beautiful

2958
00:50:26,870 --> 00:50:26,880
beautiful
 

2959
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:30,050
beautiful
you're known for being a very aggressive

2960
00:50:30,050 --> 00:50:30,060
you're known for being a very aggressive
 

2961
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:32,690
you're known for being a very aggressive
player what's your approach to being

2962
00:50:32,690 --> 00:50:32,700
player what's your approach to being
 

2963
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:34,430
player what's your approach to being
willing to take big risks at the

2964
00:50:34,430 --> 00:50:34,440
willing to take big risks at the
 

2965
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:35,390
willing to take big risks at the
chessboard

2966
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:35,400
chessboard
 

2967
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,609
chessboard
well I think that's another thing I was

2968
00:50:37,609 --> 00:50:37,619
well I think that's another thing I was
 

2969
00:50:37,619 --> 00:50:39,410
well I think that's another thing I was
a very aggressive player probably until

2970
00:50:39,410 --> 00:50:39,420
a very aggressive player probably until
 

2971
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:42,470
a very aggressive player probably until
I got to about this 2700 ELO and then it

2972
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:42,480
I got to about this 2700 ELO and then it
 

2973
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,329
I got to about this 2700 ELO and then it
kind of my style changed a little bit I

2974
00:50:44,329 --> 00:50:44,339
kind of my style changed a little bit I
 

2975
00:50:44,339 --> 00:50:46,910
kind of my style changed a little bit I
think what it is is I like to play

2976
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:46,920
think what it is is I like to play
 

2977
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:48,890
think what it is is I like to play
attacking chess I loved playing openings

2978
00:50:48,890 --> 00:50:48,900
attacking chess I loved playing openings
 

2979
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:50,630
attacking chess I loved playing openings
like the king's Indian

2980
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:50,640
like the king's Indian
 

2981
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,309
like the king's Indian
um the Sicilian night off as well when I

2982
00:50:52,309 --> 00:50:52,319
um the Sicilian night off as well when I
 

2983
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:54,650
um the Sicilian night off as well when I
was a little bit younger uh and it's

2984
00:50:54,650 --> 00:50:54,660
was a little bit younger uh and it's
 

2985
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:56,750
was a little bit younger uh and it's
just like why not try to fight with both

2986
00:50:56,750 --> 00:50:56,760
just like why not try to fight with both
 

2987
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:58,430
just like why not try to fight with both
colors try to fight in every game and

2988
00:50:58,430 --> 00:50:58,440
colors try to fight in every game and
 

2989
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:00,950
colors try to fight in every game and
win if you can uh try try as hard as you

2990
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:00,960
win if you can uh try try as hard as you
 

2991
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,230
win if you can uh try try as hard as you
can now one of the things is as you get

2992
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:03,240
can now one of the things is as you get
 

2993
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:04,670
can now one of the things is as you get
better and better players are also

2994
00:51:04,670 --> 00:51:04,680
better and better players are also
 

2995
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:06,970
better and better players are also
better and better prepared so you have

2996
00:51:06,970 --> 00:51:06,980
better and better prepared so you have
 

2997
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:09,230
better and better prepared so you have
diminishing returns when you play these

2998
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:09,240
diminishing returns when you play these
 

2999
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:10,670
diminishing returns when you play these
very aggressive openings like the king's

3000
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:10,680
very aggressive openings like the king's
 

3001
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:12,109
very aggressive openings like the king's
inning or even even the Dutch which I

3002
00:51:12,109 --> 00:51:12,119
inning or even even the Dutch which I
 

3003
00:51:12,119 --> 00:51:14,630
inning or even even the Dutch which I
played for a while you can only it only

3004
00:51:14,630 --> 00:51:14,640
played for a while you can only it only
 

3005
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,730
played for a while you can only it only
takes you so far and that if then at a

3006
00:51:16,730 --> 00:51:16,740
takes you so far and that if then at a
 

3007
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:19,010
takes you so far and that if then at a
point people figure out what how to

3008
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:19,020
point people figure out what how to
 

3009
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:21,410
point people figure out what how to
respond to those choices so I still do

3010
00:51:21,410 --> 00:51:21,420
respond to those choices so I still do
 

3011
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:23,510
respond to those choices so I still do
play these openings for example I played

3012
00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:23,520
play these openings for example I played
 

3013
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,370
play these openings for example I played
a term in St Louis about three weeks ago

3014
00:51:25,370 --> 00:51:25,380
a term in St Louis about three weeks ago
 

3015
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:26,809
a term in St Louis about three weeks ago
and I played a great King's Indian game

3016
00:51:26,809 --> 00:51:26,819
and I played a great King's Indian game
 

3017
00:51:26,819 --> 00:51:28,849
and I played a great King's Indian game
which I won against Jeffrey Zhang an

3018
00:51:28,849 --> 00:51:28,859
which I won against Jeffrey Zhang an
 

3019
00:51:28,859 --> 00:51:30,349
which I won against Jeffrey Zhang an
American Junior player so I still do

3020
00:51:30,349 --> 00:51:30,359
American Junior player so I still do
 

3021
00:51:30,359 --> 00:51:31,970
American Junior player so I still do
play it here and there but when you

3022
00:51:31,970 --> 00:51:31,980
play it here and there but when you
 

3023
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:33,890
play it here and there but when you
start playing it every game uh there's

3024
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:33,900
start playing it every game uh there's
 

3025
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:35,089
start playing it every game uh there's
there's a point at which when you lose

3026
00:51:35,089 --> 00:51:35,099
there's a point at which when you lose
 

3027
00:51:35,099 --> 00:51:36,770
there's a point at which when you lose
these game games you just can't it

3028
00:51:36,770 --> 00:51:36,780
these game games you just can't it
 

3029
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:38,809
these game games you just can't it
becomes too much and I spoke about this

3030
00:51:38,809 --> 00:51:38,819
becomes too much and I spoke about this
 

3031
00:51:38,819 --> 00:51:40,910
becomes too much and I spoke about this
in the c squared podcast where I played

3032
00:51:40,910 --> 00:51:40,920
in the c squared podcast where I played
 

3033
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:42,650
in the c squared podcast where I played
the night orph and then I played Fabiano

3034
00:51:42,650 --> 00:51:42,660
the night orph and then I played Fabiano
 

3035
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:44,870
the night orph and then I played Fabiano
caruana a very strong American player as

3036
00:51:44,870 --> 00:51:44,880
caruana a very strong American player as
 

3037
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,490
caruana a very strong American player as
well and he just blew me off the board

3038
00:51:46,490 --> 00:51:46,500
well and he just blew me off the board
 

3039
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:47,750
well and he just blew me off the board
and like four straight against I'm like

3040
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:47,760
and like four straight against I'm like
 

3041
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,609
and like four straight against I'm like
okay enough enough of this I just can't

3042
00:51:49,609 --> 00:51:49,619
okay enough enough of this I just can't
 

3043
00:51:49,619 --> 00:51:52,190
okay enough enough of this I just can't
I can't keep doing it because uh the

3044
00:51:52,190 --> 00:51:52,200
I can't keep doing it because uh the
 

3045
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,630
I can't keep doing it because uh the
heat do you think he prepared for that

3046
00:51:53,630 --> 00:51:53,640
heat do you think he prepared for that
 

3047
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:55,370
heat do you think he prepared for that
opening then absolutely because you see

3048
00:51:55,370 --> 00:51:55,380
opening then absolutely because you see
 

3049
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:57,470
opening then absolutely because you see
what what have uh

3050
00:51:57,470 --> 00:51:57,480
what what have uh
 

3051
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:58,849
what what have uh
what has my opponent been playing

3052
00:51:58,849 --> 00:51:58,859
what has my opponent been playing
 

3053
00:51:58,859 --> 00:52:00,829
what has my opponent been playing
recently where's their ideas and so I'm

3054
00:52:00,829 --> 00:52:00,839
recently where's their ideas and so I'm
 

3055
00:52:00,839 --> 00:52:02,210
recently where's their ideas and so I'm
going to prepare for those ideas that

3056
00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:02,220
going to prepare for those ideas that
 

3057
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:03,710
going to prepare for those ideas that
they've been playing with exactly yeah

3058
00:52:03,710 --> 00:52:03,720
they've been playing with exactly yeah
 

3059
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:05,630
they've been playing with exactly yeah
that's that's what you do and also you

3060
00:52:05,630 --> 00:52:05,640
that's that's what you do and also you
 

3061
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:06,890
that's that's what you do and also you
have to be very self-critical because

3062
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:06,900
have to be very self-critical because
 

3063
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:09,109
have to be very self-critical because
for Fabiano the night off was the one

3064
00:52:09,109 --> 00:52:09,119
for Fabiano the night off was the one
 

3065
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:11,210
for Fabiano the night off was the one
opening he did very poorly against but

3066
00:52:11,210 --> 00:52:11,220
opening he did very poorly against but
 

3067
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:12,890
opening he did very poorly against but
he worked really hard and he came up

3068
00:52:12,890 --> 00:52:12,900
he worked really hard and he came up
 

3069
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:14,210
he worked really hard and he came up
with a lot of different ideas and he

3070
00:52:14,210 --> 00:52:14,220
with a lot of different ideas and he
 

3071
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:15,829
with a lot of different ideas and he
solved that weakness

3072
00:52:15,829 --> 00:52:15,839
solved that weakness
 

3073
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:18,650
solved that weakness
what's the role of uh you're also known

3074
00:52:18,650 --> 00:52:18,660
what's the role of uh you're also known
 

3075
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:20,630
what's the role of uh you're also known
of having a bit of an ego

3076
00:52:20,630 --> 00:52:20,640
of having a bit of an ego
 

3077
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:23,150
of having a bit of an ego
what's the role of ego and chess is it

3078
00:52:23,150 --> 00:52:23,160
what's the role of ego and chess is it
 

3079
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:25,010
what's the role of ego and chess is it
helpful or does it get in the way I

3080
00:52:25,010 --> 00:52:25,020
helpful or does it get in the way I
 

3081
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:26,809
helpful or does it get in the way I
think it's a mix I think there's a fine

3082
00:52:26,809 --> 00:52:26,819
think it's a mix I think there's a fine
 

3083
00:52:26,819 --> 00:52:28,730
think it's a mix I think there's a fine
line I think you have to be very

3084
00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:28,740
line I think you have to be very
 

3085
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:30,530
line I think you have to be very
confident in order to get to the top I

3086
00:52:30,530 --> 00:52:30,540
confident in order to get to the top I
 

3087
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:32,809
confident in order to get to the top I
know some players are very expressive

3088
00:52:32,809 --> 00:52:32,819
know some players are very expressive
 

3089
00:52:32,819 --> 00:52:34,790
know some players are very expressive
like myself like Kasparov and others

3090
00:52:34,790 --> 00:52:34,800
like myself like Kasparov and others
 

3091
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,470
like myself like Kasparov and others
there are other people like Anon who

3092
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:36,480
there are other people like Anon who
 

3093
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,210
there are other people like Anon who
don't express it but then there was a

3094
00:52:38,210 --> 00:52:38,220
don't express it but then there was a
 

3095
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:39,770
don't express it but then there was a
book that I think was released fairly

3096
00:52:39,770 --> 00:52:39,780
book that I think was released fairly
 

3097
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:41,750
book that I think was released fairly
recently where he basically said like he

3098
00:52:41,750 --> 00:52:41,760
recently where he basically said like he
 

3099
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,430
recently where he basically said like he
he was really angry in his room and he

3100
00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:43,440
he was really angry in his room and he
 

3101
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,349
he was really angry in his room and he
was like banging walls or doing some of

3102
00:52:45,349 --> 00:52:45,359
was like banging walls or doing some of
 

3103
00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:46,970
was like banging walls or doing some of
the chairs uh I don't I don't remember

3104
00:52:46,970 --> 00:52:46,980
the chairs uh I don't I don't remember
 

3105
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:48,950
the chairs uh I don't I don't remember
the exact story but like he was he was

3106
00:52:48,950 --> 00:52:48,960
the exact story but like he was he was
 

3107
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,870
the exact story but like he was he was
able to in public he kept it very like

3108
00:52:50,870 --> 00:52:50,880
able to in public he kept it very like
 

3109
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,609
able to in public he kept it very like
very buttoned up but then in private he

3110
00:52:52,609 --> 00:52:52,619
very buttoned up but then in private he
 

3111
00:52:52,619 --> 00:52:55,010
very buttoned up but then in private he
wasn't I think you know you have to you

3112
00:52:55,010 --> 00:52:55,020
wasn't I think you know you have to you
 

3113
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:57,109
wasn't I think you know you have to you
have to have that edge if you don't have

3114
00:52:57,109 --> 00:52:57,119
have to have that edge if you don't have
 

3115
00:52:57,119 --> 00:52:58,849
have to have that edge if you don't have
that edge and you don't get upset when

3116
00:52:58,849 --> 00:52:58,859
that edge and you don't get upset when
 

3117
00:52:58,859 --> 00:53:00,589
that edge and you don't get upset when
you lose games because you will lose

3118
00:53:00,589 --> 00:53:00,599
you lose games because you will lose
 

3119
00:53:00,599 --> 00:53:02,390
you lose games because you will lose
games along the way then it's impossible

3120
00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:02,400
games along the way then it's impossible
 

3121
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,190
games along the way then it's impossible
to get anywhere near the top so I think

3122
00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:04,200
to get anywhere near the top so I think
 

3123
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:07,250
to get anywhere near the top so I think
every top player has that ego or or

3124
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:07,260
every top player has that ego or or
 

3125
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:09,290
every top player has that ego or or
extreme confidence that is necessary if

3126
00:53:09,290 --> 00:53:09,300
extreme confidence that is necessary if
 

3127
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:10,670
extreme confidence that is necessary if
you don't have that you'll never I think

3128
00:53:10,670 --> 00:53:10,680
you don't have that you'll never I think
 

3129
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:12,049
you don't have that you'll never I think
get to the top probably in almost any

3130
00:53:12,049 --> 00:53:12,059
get to the top probably in almost any
 

3131
00:53:12,059 --> 00:53:13,790
get to the top probably in almost any
field frankly do you have to believe

3132
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:13,800
field frankly do you have to believe
 

3133
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:16,490
field frankly do you have to believe
you're the best to have the capacity to

3134
00:53:16,490 --> 00:53:16,500
you're the best to have the capacity to
 

3135
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:17,809
you're the best to have the capacity to
be the best in the world

3136
00:53:17,809 --> 00:53:17,819
be the best in the world
 

3137
00:53:17,819 --> 00:53:19,309
be the best in the world
yeah I think you have to have that I

3138
00:53:19,309 --> 00:53:19,319
yeah I think you have to have that I
 

3139
00:53:19,319 --> 00:53:21,650
yeah I think you have to have that I
think for me it wasn't really ever about

3140
00:53:21,650 --> 00:53:21,660
think for me it wasn't really ever about
 

3141
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:23,030
think for me it wasn't really ever about
thinking I'm the best in the world it's

3142
00:53:23,030 --> 00:53:23,040
thinking I'm the best in the world it's
 

3143
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,950
thinking I'm the best in the world it's
about like going into that game that

3144
00:53:24,950 --> 00:53:24,960
about like going into that game that
 

3145
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,630
about like going into that game that
game whoever I'm playing I believe that

3146
00:53:26,630 --> 00:53:26,640
game whoever I'm playing I believe that
 

3147
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:28,130
game whoever I'm playing I believe that
I can beat them or I know that I'm gonna

3148
00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:28,140
I can beat them or I know that I'm gonna
 

3149
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:29,809
I can beat them or I know that I'm gonna
beat them or I'm better than them that's

3150
00:53:29,809 --> 00:53:29,819
beat them or I'm better than them that's
 

3151
00:53:29,819 --> 00:53:31,790
beat them or I'm better than them that's
for me it was always about the that

3152
00:53:31,790 --> 00:53:31,800
for me it was always about the that
 

3153
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,589
for me it was always about the that
whenever I'm in that moment in the game

3154
00:53:33,589 --> 00:53:33,599
whenever I'm in that moment in the game
 

3155
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:35,510
whenever I'm in that moment in the game
just knowing that that I can do that I

3156
00:53:35,510 --> 00:53:35,520
just knowing that that I can do that I
 

3157
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,849
just knowing that that I can do that I
think that is also another thing that

3158
00:53:37,849 --> 00:53:37,859
think that is also another thing that
 

3159
00:53:37,859 --> 00:53:39,470
think that is also another thing that
when you start playing more and more in

3160
00:53:39,470 --> 00:53:39,480
when you start playing more and more in
 

3161
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:41,210
when you start playing more and more in
these top tournaments you kind of lose

3162
00:53:41,210 --> 00:53:41,220
these top tournaments you kind of lose
 

3163
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:43,790
these top tournaments you kind of lose
that sometimes because the positions you

3164
00:53:43,790 --> 00:53:43,800
that sometimes because the positions you
 

3165
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,890
that sometimes because the positions you
have the same opening strategies you end

3166
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:45,900
have the same opening strategies you end
 

3167
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:47,630
have the same opening strategies you end
up with positions that are very drawish

3168
00:53:47,630 --> 00:53:47,640
up with positions that are very drawish
 

3169
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:49,549
up with positions that are very drawish
where you reach end games things of this

3170
00:53:49,549 --> 00:53:49,559
where you reach end games things of this
 

3171
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:50,750
where you reach end games things of this
nature and so it can also make you very

3172
00:53:50,750 --> 00:53:50,760
nature and so it can also make you very
 

3173
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:52,430
nature and so it can also make you very
jaded as well

3174
00:53:52,430 --> 00:53:52,440
jaded as well
 

3175
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:53,750
jaded as well
um after you've been up there for quite

3176
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:53,760
um after you've been up there for quite
 

3177
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:55,849
um after you've been up there for quite
a long time well there are times you're

3178
00:53:55,849 --> 00:53:55,859
a long time well there are times you're

3181
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:02,089
an to someone and you regret it
at the chess board or Beyond yeah so I'm

3182
00:54:02,089 --> 00:54:02,099
at the chess board or Beyond yeah so I'm
 

3183
00:54:02,099 --> 00:54:04,069
at the chess board or Beyond yeah so I'm
asking internet questions yeah I mean

3184
00:54:04,069 --> 00:54:04,079
asking internet questions yeah I mean

00:54:05,569 --> 00:54:05,579
this is definitely true I'm not going to
 

3187
00:54:05,579 --> 00:54:06,890
this is definitely true I'm not going to
pretend it isn't when I when I was

3188
00:54:06,890 --> 00:54:06,900
pretend it isn't when I when I was
 

3189
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:08,030
pretend it isn't when I when I was
younger

3190
00:54:08,030 --> 00:54:08,040
younger
 

3191
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:10,130
younger
um I was very angry when I lose games on

3192
00:54:10,130 --> 00:54:10,140
um I was very angry when I lose games on
 

3193
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:11,089
um I was very angry when I lose games on
the internet

3194
00:54:11,089 --> 00:54:11,099
the internet
 

3195
00:54:11,099 --> 00:54:13,010
the internet
um many of these stories are

3196
00:54:13,010 --> 00:54:13,020
um many of these stories are
 

3197
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:14,450
um many of these stories are
specifically from the internet of course

3198
00:54:14,450 --> 00:54:14,460
specifically from the internet of course
 

3199
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:16,609
specifically from the internet of course
and you know I think I look back on it

3200
00:54:16,609 --> 00:54:16,619
and you know I think I look back on it
 

3201
00:54:16,619 --> 00:54:18,829
and you know I think I look back on it
and of course I I wish that I'd been

3202
00:54:18,829 --> 00:54:18,839
and of course I I wish that I'd been
 

3203
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:20,150
and of course I I wish that I'd been
able to like channel the anger

3204
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:20,160
able to like channel the anger
 

3205
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,710
able to like channel the anger
differently basically I think the simple

3206
00:54:21,710 --> 00:54:21,720
differently basically I think the simple
 

3207
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:23,450
differently basically I think the simple
gist of it is I would play Blitz Games

3208
00:54:23,450 --> 00:54:23,460
gist of it is I would play Blitz Games
 

3209
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:25,609
gist of it is I would play Blitz Games
online and I lost I would get angry at

3210
00:54:25,609 --> 00:54:25,619
online and I lost I would get angry at
 

3211
00:54:25,619 --> 00:54:27,170
online and I lost I would get angry at
my opponents instead of getting angry at

3212
00:54:27,170 --> 00:54:27,180
my opponents instead of getting angry at
 

3213
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:28,130
my opponents instead of getting angry at
myself

3214
00:54:28,130 --> 00:54:28,140
myself
 

3215
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:29,690
myself
um which of course it's silly because

3216
00:54:29,690 --> 00:54:29,700
um which of course it's silly because
 

3217
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:30,950
um which of course it's silly because
they're playing the game they're trying

3218
00:54:30,950 --> 00:54:30,960
they're playing the game they're trying
 

3219
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:32,329
they're playing the game they're trying
to win like why shouldn't they try to

3220
00:54:32,329 --> 00:54:32,339
to win like why shouldn't they try to
 

3221
00:54:32,339 --> 00:54:34,430
to win like why shouldn't they try to
beat you I think for me like I'm not

3222
00:54:34,430 --> 00:54:34,440
beat you I think for me like I'm not
 

3223
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:36,290
beat you I think for me like I'm not
happy about that when I was when I was a

3224
00:54:36,290 --> 00:54:36,300
happy about that when I was when I was a
 

3225
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:38,089
happy about that when I was when I was a
young teenager getting so angry over

3226
00:54:38,089 --> 00:54:38,099
young teenager getting so angry over
 

3227
00:54:38,099 --> 00:54:39,950
young teenager getting so angry over
these online games and insulting a lot

these online games and insulting a lot
 

3229
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:42,109
these online games and insulting a lot
of people along the way but maybe that

3230
00:54:42,109 --> 00:54:42,119
of people along the way but maybe that
 

3231
00:54:42,119 --> 00:54:44,390
of people along the way but maybe that
paved the way to your streaming career I

3232
00:54:44,390 --> 00:54:44,400
paved the way to your streaming career I
 

3233

00:54:48,829 --> 00:54:48,839
that me against the world attitude
 

3237
00:54:48,839 --> 00:54:50,390
that me against the world attitude
though it really fueled me when I was

3238
00:54:50,390 --> 00:54:50,400
though it really fueled me when I was
 

3239
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:51,470
though it really fueled me when I was
younger feeling like it was me against

3240
00:54:51,470 --> 00:54:51,480
younger feeling like it was me against
 

3241
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:53,329
younger feeling like it was me against
the world everyone hating me or me

3242
00:54:53,329 --> 00:54:53,339
the world everyone hating me or me

hating the world that was very important
 

3245
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:56,990
hating the world that was very important
I was able to channel that anger in a

3246
00:54:56,990 --> 00:54:57,000
I was able to channel that anger in a
 

3247
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,270
I was able to channel that anger in a
way that really helped me improve so

3248
00:54:59,270 --> 00:54:59,280

things stand
 

3289
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:49,010
things stand
now at the beginning of October yeah

3290
00:55:49,010 --> 00:55:49,020
now at the beginning of October yeah
 

3291
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:52,069
now at the beginning of October yeah
it's that's a very tough question for a

3292
00:55:52,069 --> 00:55:52,079
it's that's a very tough question for a
 

3293
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:53,690
it's that's a very tough question for a
couple of reasons I think first of all

3294
00:55:53,690 --> 00:55:53,700
couple of reasons I think first of all
 

3295
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:56,569
couple of reasons I think first of all
when people refer to evidence in regards

3296
00:55:56,569 --> 00:55:56,579
when people refer to evidence in regards
 

3297
00:55:56,579 --> 00:55:57,770
when people refer to evidence in regards
to whether Han street over the board

3298
00:55:57,770 --> 00:55:57,780
to whether Han street over the board
 

3299
00:55:57,780 --> 00:55:59,690
to whether Han street over the board
there is not I don't think there ever

3300
00:55:59,690 --> 00:55:59,700
there is not I don't think there ever
 

3301
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:01,490
there is not I don't think there ever
will be quote unquote hard evidence the

3302
00:56:01,490 --> 00:56:01,500
will be quote unquote hard evidence the
 

3303
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:02,870
will be quote unquote hard evidence the
only thing that would ever constitute

3304
00:56:02,870 --> 00:56:02,880
only thing that would ever constitute
 

3305
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,490
only thing that would ever constitute
that is if he's caught in the act

3306
00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:04,500
that is if he's caught in the act
 

3307
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:06,109
that is if he's caught in the act
literally he's caught like using a phone

3308
00:56:06,109 --> 00:56:06,119
literally he's caught like using a phone
 

3309
00:56:06,119 --> 00:56:08,089
literally he's caught like using a phone
with an earpiece whatever it might be

3310
00:56:08,089 --> 00:56:08,099
with an earpiece whatever it might be
 

3311
00:56:08,099 --> 00:56:10,010
with an earpiece whatever it might be
that is the only way that there would

3312
00:56:10,010 --> 00:56:10,020
that is the only way that there would
 

3313
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:12,349
that is the only way that there would
ever be hard evidence so as it stands

3314
00:56:12,349 --> 00:56:12,359
ever be hard evidence so as it stands
 

3315
00:56:12,359 --> 00:56:13,549
ever be hard evidence so as it stands
right now there's a lot of

3316
00:56:13,549 --> 00:56:13,559
right now there's a lot of
 

3317
00:56:13,559 --> 00:56:15,230
right now there's a lot of
circumstantial evidence how much of it

3318
00:56:15,230 --> 00:56:15,240
circumstantial evidence how much of it
 

3319
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:17,329
circumstantial evidence how much of it
is legitimate or not remains to be seen

3320
00:56:17,329 --> 00:56:17,339
is legitimate or not remains to be seen
 

3321
00:56:17,339 --> 00:56:19,370
is legitimate or not remains to be seen
I know people have questioned the

3322
00:56:19,370 --> 00:56:19,380
I know people have questioned the
 

3323
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:21,170
I know people have questioned the
statistics some people think it's very

3324
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:21,180
statistics some people think it's very
 

3325
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:22,549
statistics some people think it's very
convincing some people think it's

3326
00:56:22,549 --> 00:56:22,559
convincing some people think it's
 

3327
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:24,049
convincing some people think it's
complete nonsense

3328
00:56:24,049 --> 00:56:24,059
complete nonsense
 

3329
00:56:24,059 --> 00:56:27,650
complete nonsense
I think I think that right now I'm I'm

3330
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:27,660
I think I think that right now I'm I'm
 

3331
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:30,349
I think I think that right now I'm I'm
very undecided uh but I I do feel that

3332
00:56:30,349 --> 00:56:30,359
very undecided uh but I I do feel that
 

3333
00:56:30,359 --> 00:56:31,849
very undecided uh but I I do feel that
within the next like three to six months

3334
00:56:31,849 --> 00:56:31,859
within the next like three to six months
 

3335
00:56:31,859 --> 00:56:33,890
within the next like three to six months
assuming Hans is able to play over the

3336
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:33,900
assuming Hans is able to play over the
 

3337
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:35,990
assuming Hans is able to play over the
board and more tournaments the stats

3338
00:56:35,990 --> 00:56:36,000
board and more tournaments the stats
 

3339
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,670
board and more tournaments the stats
will make it very clear one way or the

3340
00:56:37,670 --> 00:56:37,680
will make it very clear one way or the
 

3341
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:39,349
will make it very clear one way or the
other based on results whether it's

3342
00:56:39,349 --> 00:56:39,359
other based on results whether it's
 

3343
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:41,690
other based on results whether it's
legitimate or not I think I think for me

3344
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:41,700
legitimate or not I think I think for me
 

3345
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:44,210
legitimate or not I think I think for me
I would say that regardless of whether

3346
00:56:44,210 --> 00:56:44,220
I would say that regardless of whether
 

3347
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:45,890
I would say that regardless of whether
whether you whether like I believe you

3348
00:56:45,890 --> 00:56:45,900
whether you whether like I believe you
 

3349
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:48,170
whether you whether like I believe you
cheated or not he is playing at probably

3350
00:56:48,170 --> 00:56:48,180
cheated or not he is playing at probably
 

3351
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:51,049
cheated or not he is playing at probably
a 20 he's probably at least 2 650 no

3352
00:56:51,049 --> 00:56:51,059
a 20 he's probably at least 2 650 no
 

3353
00:56:51,059 --> 00:56:52,670
a 20 he's probably at least 2 650 no
matter what regardless of whether he's

3354
00:56:52,670 --> 00:56:52,680
matter what regardless of whether he's
 

3355
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:54,170
matter what regardless of whether he's
cheating or not he's already at that

3356
00:56:54,170 --> 00:56:54,180
cheating or not he's already at that
 

3357
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:56,390
cheating or not he's already at that
level which is very very high so I think

3358
00:56:56,390 --> 00:56:56,400
level which is very very high so I think
 

3359
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:57,950
level which is very very high so I think
the stats will will bear it out in the

3360
00:56:57,950 --> 00:56:57,960
the stats will will bear it out in the
 

3361
00:56:57,960 --> 00:56:59,809
the stats will will bear it out in the
next probably I say I said three to six

3362
00:56:59,809 --> 00:56:59,819
next probably I say I said three to six
 

3363
00:56:59,819 --> 00:57:01,250
next probably I say I said three to six
months probably I would say next six to

3364
00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:01,260
months probably I would say next six to
 

3365
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:03,290
months probably I would say next six to
12 months um whether something happened

3366
00:57:03,290 --> 00:57:03,300
12 months um whether something happened
 

3367
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:04,370
12 months um whether something happened
but

3368
00:57:04,370 --> 00:57:04,380
but
 

3369
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:06,710
but
I I really don't know do you find

3370
00:57:06,710 --> 00:57:06,720
I I really don't know do you find
 

3371
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:10,130
I I really don't know do you find
compelling or interesting uh the kind of

3372
00:57:10,130 --> 00:57:10,140
compelling or interesting uh the kind of
 

3373
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:11,450
compelling or interesting uh the kind of
analysis where you compare the

3374
00:57:11,450 --> 00:57:11,460
analysis where you compare the
 

3375
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:13,730
analysis where you compare the
correlation between engines and humans

3376
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:13,740
correlation between engines and humans
 

3377
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:16,609
correlation between engines and humans
to to try to determine if cheating was

3378
00:57:16,609 --> 00:57:16,619
to to try to determine if cheating was
 

3379
00:57:16,619 --> 00:57:18,950
to to try to determine if cheating was
done in part so initially I thought that

3380
00:57:18,950 --> 00:57:18,960
done in part so initially I thought that
 

3381
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:21,049
done in part so initially I thought that
that was actually quite legitimate but

3382
00:57:21,049 --> 00:57:21,059
that was actually quite legitimate but
 

3383
00:57:21,059 --> 00:57:22,970
that was actually quite legitimate but
as I as I found out much more recently

3384
00:57:22,970 --> 00:57:22,980
as I as I found out much more recently
 

3385
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:25,190
as I as I found out much more recently
anybody can basically upload this data

3386
00:57:25,190 --> 00:57:25,200
anybody can basically upload this data
 

3387
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,049
anybody can basically upload this data
so that whole Theory while it seemed

3388
00:57:27,049 --> 00:57:27,059
so that whole Theory while it seemed
 

3389
00:57:27,059 --> 00:57:29,089
so that whole Theory while it seemed
very convincing at the time it simply

3390
00:57:29,089 --> 00:57:29,099
very convincing at the time it simply
 

3391
00:57:29,099 --> 00:57:31,910
very convincing at the time it simply
isn't isn't any statistical

3392
00:57:31,910 --> 00:57:31,920
isn't isn't any statistical
 

3393
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:35,150
isn't isn't any statistical
um evidence in my opinion now but there

3394
00:57:35,150 --> 00:57:35,160
um evidence in my opinion now but there
 

3395
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,589
um evidence in my opinion now but there
there are games from some of those

3396
00:57:36,589 --> 00:57:36,599
there are games from some of those
 

3397
00:57:36,599 --> 00:57:38,150
there are games from some of those
tournaments that definitely considering

3398
00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:38,160
tournaments that definitely considering
 

3399
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:39,890
tournaments that definitely considering
where his rating was look very

3400
00:57:39,890 --> 00:57:39,900
where his rating was look very
 

3401
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:42,950
where his rating was look very
suspicious in 2020 I would say

3402
00:57:42,950 --> 00:57:42,960
suspicious in 2020 I would say
 

3403
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,349
suspicious in 2020 I would say
um again that's not the role like myself

3404
00:57:45,349 --> 00:57:45,359
um again that's not the role like myself
 

3405
00:57:45,359 --> 00:57:47,569
um again that's not the role like myself
to decide or chess.com that's obviously

3406
00:57:47,569 --> 00:57:47,579
to decide or chess.com that's obviously
 

3407
00:57:47,579 --> 00:57:49,370
to decide or chess.com that's obviously
going to be up to fide whether they

3408
00:57:49,370 --> 00:57:49,380
going to be up to fide whether they
 

3409
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:52,130
going to be up to fide whether they
think that's compelling evidence or not

3410
00:57:52,130 --> 00:57:52,140
think that's compelling evidence or not
 

3411
00:57:52,140 --> 00:57:54,190
think that's compelling evidence or not
um I think for me

3412
00:57:54,190 --> 00:57:54,200
um I think for me
 

3413
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:56,270
um I think for me
what I would say from an intuitive

3414
00:57:56,270 --> 00:57:56,280
what I would say from an intuitive
 

3415
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:58,370
what I would say from an intuitive
standpoint is that I've been in this

3416
00:57:58,370 --> 00:57:58,380
standpoint is that I've been in this
 

3417
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:00,230
standpoint is that I've been in this
world for a very very long time I've

3418
00:58:00,230 --> 00:58:00,240
world for a very very long time I've
 

3419
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:02,510
world for a very very long time I've
I've seen mostly Juniors as they've

3420
00:58:02,510 --> 00:58:02,520
I've seen mostly Juniors as they've
 

3421
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:04,190
I've seen mostly Juniors as they've
risen through the ranks Magnus and many

3422
00:58:04,190 --> 00:58:04,200
risen through the ranks Magnus and many
 

3423
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:05,329
risen through the ranks Magnus and many
others

3424
00:58:05,329 --> 00:58:05,339
others
 

3425
00:58:05,339 --> 00:58:06,530
others
um and there's always been something

3426
00:58:06,530 --> 00:58:06,540
um and there's always been something
 

3427
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:08,270
um and there's always been something
about them that has stood out to me

3428
00:58:08,270 --> 00:58:08,280
about them that has stood out to me
 

3429
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:09,770
about them that has stood out to me
that's been like a brilliant game

3430
00:58:09,770 --> 00:58:09,780
that's been like a brilliant game
 

3431
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:10,730
that's been like a brilliant game
they've played against someone who's

3432
00:58:10,730 --> 00:58:10,740
they've played against someone who's
 

3433
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:12,829
they've played against someone who's
much higher rated I've just seen it from

3434
00:58:12,829 --> 00:58:12,839
much higher rated I've just seen it from
 

3435
00:58:12,839 --> 00:58:15,290
much higher rated I've just seen it from
all the all those players I never really

3436
00:58:15,290 --> 00:58:15,300
all the all those players I never really
 

3437
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:18,349
all the all those players I never really
saw that with Hans Neiman so it's very

3438
00:58:18,349 --> 00:58:18,359
saw that with Hans Neiman so it's very
 

3439
00:58:18,359 --> 00:58:20,329
saw that with Hans Neiman so it's very
difficult for me to sort of with my own

3440
00:58:20,329 --> 00:58:20,339
difficult for me to sort of with my own
 

3441
00:58:20,339 --> 00:58:22,250
difficult for me to sort of with my own
twice being in this Chess World so long

3442
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:22,260
twice being in this Chess World so long
 

3443
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:24,890
twice being in this Chess World so long
see things a certain way and then like

3444
00:58:24,890 --> 00:58:24,900
see things a certain way and then like
 

3445
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:26,030
see things a certain way and then like
something that's never happened before

3446
00:58:26,030 --> 00:58:26,040
something that's never happened before
 

3447
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:27,829
something that's never happened before
is happening but at the end of the day

3448
00:58:27,829 --> 00:58:27,839
is happening but at the end of the day
 

3449
00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:29,569
is happening but at the end of the day
it is still possible it is completely

3450
00:58:29,569 --> 00:58:29,579
it is still possible it is completely
 

3451
00:58:29,579 --> 00:58:31,790
it is still possible it is completely
possible that Hans something clicked at

3452
00:58:31,790 --> 00:58:31,800
possible that Hans something clicked at
 

3453
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:33,349
possible that Hans something clicked at
a certain age and he started improving

3454
00:58:33,349 --> 00:58:33,359
a certain age and he started improving
 

3455
00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:35,150
a certain age and he started improving
in spite of the fact that you know the

3456
00:58:35,150 --> 00:58:35,160
in spite of the fact that you know the
 

3457
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:37,069
in spite of the fact that you know the
statistics look weird in terms of his

3458
00:58:37,069 --> 00:58:37,079
statistics look weird in terms of his
 

3459
00:58:37,079 --> 00:58:39,530
statistics look weird in terms of his
rating Improvement so I don't know I I

3460
00:58:39,530 --> 00:58:39,540
rating Improvement so I don't know I I
 

3461
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:41,690
rating Improvement so I don't know I I
sort of I think that in six to 12 months

3462
00:58:41,690 --> 00:58:41,700
sort of I think that in six to 12 months
 

3463
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:43,910
sort of I think that in six to 12 months
I'll probably be able to say one way or

3464
00:58:43,910 --> 00:58:43,920
I'll probably be able to say one way or
 

3465
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:46,130
I'll probably be able to say one way or
the other with very certain confidence

3466
00:58:46,130 --> 00:58:46,140
the other with very certain confidence
 

3467
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:48,109
the other with very certain confidence
like you know whether whether he should

3468
00:58:48,109 --> 00:58:48,119
like you know whether whether he should
 

3469
00:58:48,119 --> 00:58:49,970
like you know whether whether he should
be there or not speaking of Statistics

3470
00:58:49,970 --> 00:58:49,980
be there or not speaking of Statistics
 

3471
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:52,549
be there or not speaking of Statistics
uh I should ask I'm not sure about this

3472
00:58:52,549 --> 00:58:52,559
uh I should ask I'm not sure about this
 

3473
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:54,829
uh I should ask I'm not sure about this
are you a data scientist right that's a

3474
00:58:54,829 --> 00:58:54,839
are you a data scientist right that's a
 

3475
00:58:54,839 --> 00:58:56,750
are you a data scientist right that's a
good one no of course I'm not you know

3476
00:58:56,750 --> 00:58:56,760
good one no of course I'm not you know
 

3477
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:59,270
good one no of course I'm not you know
but it's that's the thing you see you

3478
00:58:59,270 --> 00:58:59,280
but it's that's the thing you see you
 

3479
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:01,069
but it's that's the thing you see you
see all these stats are thrown out there

3480
00:59:01,069 --> 00:59:01,079
see all these stats are thrown out there
 

3481
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:02,390
see all these stats are thrown out there
and you you try to try to understand

3482
00:59:02,390 --> 00:59:02,400
and you you try to try to understand
 

3483
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,010
and you you try to try to understand
what's being said

3484
00:59:04,010 --> 00:59:04,020
what's being said
 

3485
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:06,289
what's being said
um but it's it's also very scary because

3486
00:59:06,289 --> 00:59:06,299
um but it's it's also very scary because
 

3487
00:59:06,299 --> 00:59:07,910
um but it's it's also very scary because
when you see these things that look very

3488
00:59:07,910 --> 00:59:07,920
when you see these things that look very
 

3489
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,530
when you see these things that look very
legitimate and then they're they're

3490
00:59:09,530 --> 00:59:09,540
legitimate and then they're they're
 

3491
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:11,270
legitimate and then they're they're
disproven or people say like you're

3492
00:59:11,270 --> 00:59:11,280
disproven or people say like you're
 

3493
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:13,069
disproven or people say like you're
cherry picking like the dates and all

3494
00:59:13,069 --> 00:59:13,079
cherry picking like the dates and all
 

3495
00:59:13,079 --> 00:59:14,150
cherry picking like the dates and all
these other things it almost feels like

3496
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:14,160
these other things it almost feels like
 

3497
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:15,890
these other things it almost feels like
you can come to any conclusion that you

3498
00:59:15,890 --> 00:59:15,900
you can come to any conclusion that you
 

3499
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:17,750
you can come to any conclusion that you
want to yeah and that's why I think this

3500
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:17,760
want to yeah and that's why I think this
 

3501
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,670
want to yeah and that's why I think this
is such a serious issue for the world of

3502
00:59:19,670 --> 00:59:19,680
is such a serious issue for the world of
 

3503
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:20,930
is such a serious issue for the world of
Chess because

3504
00:59:20,930 --> 00:59:20,940
Chess because
 

3505
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:23,630
Chess because
going forward if we don't take it

3506
00:59:23,630 --> 00:59:23,640
going forward if we don't take it
 

3507
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:25,069
going forward if we don't take it
seriously now I think at some point

3508
00:59:25,069 --> 00:59:25,079
seriously now I think at some point
 

3509
00:59:25,079 --> 00:59:27,109
seriously now I think at some point
there is the potential for a much much

3510
00:59:27,109 --> 00:59:27,119
there is the potential for a much much
 

3511
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:29,270
there is the potential for a much much
larger Scandal do you agree that like

3512
00:59:29,270 --> 00:59:29,280
larger Scandal do you agree that like
 

3513
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:31,370
larger Scandal do you agree that like
with Magnus I think said that it is an

3514
00:59:31,370 --> 00:59:31,380
with Magnus I think said that it is an
 

3515
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:33,230
with Magnus I think said that it is an
existential threat to chess like this is

3516
00:59:33,230 --> 00:59:33,240
existential threat to chess like this is
 

3517
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:35,630
existential threat to chess like this is
a very serious problem that's only going

3518
00:59:35,630 --> 00:59:35,640
a very serious problem that's only going
 

3519
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:38,329
a very serious problem that's only going
to get bigger because it's you're

3520
00:59:38,329 --> 00:59:38,339
to get bigger because it's you're
 

3521
00:59:38,339 --> 00:59:39,950
to get bigger because it's you're
basically

3522
00:59:39,950 --> 00:59:39,960
basically
 

3523
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:42,349
basically
uh from a spectator perspective from a

3524
00:59:42,349 --> 00:59:42,359
uh from a spectator perspective from a
 

3525
00:59:42,359 --> 00:59:44,150
uh from a spectator perspective from a
competitor perspective or not sure that

3526
00:59:44,150 --> 00:59:44,160
competitor perspective or not sure that
 

3527
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:47,030
competitor perspective or not sure that
you can trust any of the results

3528
00:59:47,030 --> 00:59:47,040
you can trust any of the results
 

3529
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:49,370
you can trust any of the results
that's for sure true when I think back

3530
00:59:49,370 --> 00:59:49,380
that's for sure true when I think back
 

3531
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:51,230
that's for sure true when I think back
to the last like five to ten years there

3532
00:59:51,230 --> 00:59:51,240
to the last like five to ten years there
 

3533
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:52,609
to the last like five to ten years there
are plenty of top level tournaments that

3534
00:59:52,609 --> 00:59:52,619
are plenty of top level tournaments that
 

3535
00:59:52,619 --> 00:59:53,809
are plenty of top level tournaments that
I played in where there was no security

3536
00:59:53,809 --> 00:59:53,819
I played in where there was no security
 

3537
00:59:53,819 --> 00:59:56,329
I played in where there was no security
at all yeah um you just you just go into

3538
00:59:56,329 --> 00:59:56,339
at all yeah um you just you just go into
 

3539
00:59:56,339 --> 00:59:58,190
at all yeah um you just you just go into
the auditorium and play your games and

3540
00:59:58,190 --> 00:59:58,200
the auditorium and play your games and
 

3541
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:00,650
the auditorium and play your games and
that was that so I do think it's a big

3542
01:00:00,650 --> 01:00:00,660
that was that so I do think it's a big
 

3543
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:02,329
that was that so I do think it's a big
issue I think it has been a big issue

3544
01:00:02,329 --> 01:00:02,339
issue I think it has been a big issue
 

3545
01:00:02,339 --> 01:00:04,130
issue I think it has been a big issue
but the reason it's only coming to light

3546
01:00:04,130 --> 01:00:04,140
but the reason it's only coming to light
 

3547
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:06,770
but the reason it's only coming to light
now is because it features a very strong

3548
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:06,780
now is because it features a very strong
 

3549
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:08,510
now is because it features a very strong
Junior player who's very close to the

3550
01:00:08,510 --> 01:00:08,520
Junior player who's very close to the
 

3551
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:09,890
Junior player who's very close to the
world's Elite there have been many

3552
01:00:09,890 --> 01:00:09,900
world's Elite there have been many
 

3553
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:12,049
world's Elite there have been many
achieving scandals before uh there was

3554
01:00:12,049 --> 01:00:12,059
achieving scandals before uh there was
 

3555
01:00:12,059 --> 01:00:13,730
achieving scandals before uh there was

3569
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:27,349
those are three big cheating scandals
but they were not at the absolute top

3570
01:00:27,349 --> 01:00:27,359
but they were not at the absolute top
 

3571
01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:30,049
but they were not at the absolute top
levels of Chess which I think is why

3572
01:00:30,049 --> 01:00:30,059
levels of Chess which I think is why
 

3573
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:31,730
levels of Chess which I think is why
um it never became the huge news story

3574
01:00:31,730 --> 01:00:31,740
um it never became the huge news story
 

3575
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:33,710
um it never became the huge news story
that this is or it wasn't viewed in the

3576
01:00:33,710 --> 01:00:33,720
that this is or it wasn't viewed in the
 

3577
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:35,270
that this is or it wasn't viewed in the
same kind of ways why I think organizers

3578
01:00:35,270 --> 01:00:35,280
same kind of ways why I think organizers
 

3579
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:37,309
same kind of ways why I think organizers
were perhaps a little bit too LAX in

3580
01:00:37,309 --> 01:00:37,319
were perhaps a little bit too LAX in
 

3581
01:00:37,319 --> 01:00:40,089
were perhaps a little bit too LAX in
terms of security so you said

3582
01:00:40,089 --> 01:00:40,099
terms of security so you said
 

3583
01:00:40,099 --> 01:00:43,450
terms of security so you said
2650 is it possible

3584
01:00:43,450 --> 01:00:43,460
2650 is it possible
 

3585
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:46,549
2650 is it possible
that Hans is in fact a kind of Bobby

3586
01:00:46,549 --> 01:00:46,559
that Hans is in fact a kind of Bobby
 

3587

that Hans is in fact a kind of Bobby
Fischer level of genius and he's capable

3588
01:00:49,670 --> 01:00:49,680
Fischer level of genius and he's capable
 

3589
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:52,670
Fischer level of genius and he's capable
at times of Genius at the chessboard oh

3590
01:00:52,670 --> 01:00:52,680
at times of Genius at the chessboard oh
 

3591
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:55,190
at times of Genius at the chessboard oh
absolutely 100 that that is absolutely

3592
01:00:55,190 --> 01:00:55,200
absolutely 100 that that is absolutely
 

3593
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:57,530
absolutely 100 that that is absolutely
possible I think that's why I think for

3594
01:00:57,530 --> 01:00:57,540
possible I think that's why I think for
 

3595
01:00:57,540 --> 01:00:59,630
possible I think that's why I think for
everybody in the situation we want to

3596
01:00:59,630 --> 01:00:59,640
everybody in the situation we want to
 

3597
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:02,030
everybody in the situation we want to
see what happens in the next six to 12

3598
01:01:02,030 --> 01:01:02,040
see what happens in the next six to 12
 

3599
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:04,010
see what happens in the next six to 12
months because I think it will be very

3600
01:01:04,010 --> 01:01:04,020
months because I think it will be very
 

3601
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:06,049
months because I think it will be very
clear also it's very interesting to me

3602
01:01:06,049 --> 01:01:06,059
clear also it's very interesting to me
 

3603
01:01:06,059 --> 01:01:08,089
clear also it's very interesting to me
because there are other stats um from

3604
01:01:08,089 --> 01:01:08,099
because there are other stats um from
 

3605
01:01:08,099 --> 01:01:09,950
because there are other stats um from
that 72-page report that chess.com

3606
01:01:09,950 --> 01:01:09,960
that 72-page report that chess.com
 

3607
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:12,410
that 72-page report that chess.com
compiled which in essence says certain

3608
01:01:12,410 --> 01:01:12,420
compiled which in essence says certain
 

3609
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:13,849
compiled which in essence says certain
other Junior players basically have

3610
01:01:13,849 --> 01:01:13,859
other Junior players basically have
 

3611
01:01:13,859 --> 01:01:15,589
other Junior players basically have
peaked that they're not likely to

3612
01:01:15,589 --> 01:01:15,599
peaked that they're not likely to
 

3613
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:17,089
peaked that they're not likely to
improve further so it's also going to be

3614
01:01:17,089 --> 01:01:17,099
improve further so it's also going to be
 

3615
01:01:17,099 --> 01:01:19,309
improve further so it's also going to be
very interesting when you look at those

3616
01:01:19,309 --> 01:01:19,319
very interesting when you look at those
 

3617
01:01:19,319 --> 01:01:21,710
very interesting when you look at those
like I think it was like 50 pages of

3618
01:01:21,710 --> 01:01:21,720
like I think it was like 50 pages of
 

3619
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:23,510
like I think it was like 50 pages of
graphs because there are graphs that say

3620
01:01:23,510 --> 01:01:23,520
graphs because there are graphs that say
 

3621
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:24,589
graphs because there are graphs that say
like some of the other Junior players

3622
01:01:24,589 --> 01:01:24,599
like some of the other Junior players
 

3623
01:01:24,599 --> 01:01:26,210
like some of the other Junior players
are done so when we look forward like in

3624
01:01:26,210 --> 01:01:26,220
are done so when we look forward like in
 

3625
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:27,890
are done so when we look forward like in
a year or two if those players don't

3626
01:01:27,890 --> 01:01:27,900
a year or two if those players don't
 

3627
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:29,990
a year or two if those players don't
improve it will also say something about

3628
01:01:29,990 --> 01:01:30,000
improve it will also say something about
 

3629
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,089
improve it will also say something about
their methods as well that they've used

3630
01:01:32,089 --> 01:01:32,099
their methods as well that they've used
 

3631
01:01:32,099 --> 01:01:34,130
their methods as well that they've used
to sort of compile this data

3632
01:01:34,130 --> 01:01:34,140
to sort of compile this data
 

3633
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:36,230
to sort of compile this data
yeah I wonder what those Junior players

3634
01:01:36,230 --> 01:01:36,240
yeah I wonder what those Junior players
 

3635
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:38,990
yeah I wonder what those Junior players
do if they look at that data so there's

3636
01:01:38,990 --> 01:01:39,000
do if they look at that data so there's
 

3637
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,370
do if they look at that data so there's
a point where you should look at

3638
01:01:40,370 --> 01:01:40,380
a point where you should look at
 

3639
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:42,829
a point where you should look at
yourself like practically

3640
01:01:42,829 --> 01:01:42,839
yourself like practically
 

3641
01:01:42,839 --> 01:01:45,530
yourself like practically
like what what is the actual empirical

3642
01:01:45,530 --> 01:01:45,540
like what what is the actual empirical
 

3643
01:01:45,540 --> 01:01:48,289
like what what is the actual empirical
data over the past year of how much I've

3644
01:01:48,289 --> 01:01:48,299
data over the past year of how much I've
 

3645
01:01:48,299 --> 01:01:50,630
data over the past year of how much I've
improved at a particular thing like it's

3646
01:01:50,630 --> 01:01:50,640
improved at a particular thing like it's
 

3647
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:53,210
improved at a particular thing like it's
one thing to kind of tell yourself that

3648
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:53,220
one thing to kind of tell yourself that
 

3649
01:01:53,220 --> 01:01:54,589
one thing to kind of tell yourself that
these are the ways I need to improve and

3650
01:01:54,589 --> 01:01:54,599
these are the ways I need to improve and
 

3651
01:01:54,599 --> 01:01:55,970
these are the ways I need to improve and
it's another to actually look at the

3652
01:01:55,970 --> 01:01:55,980
it's another to actually look at the
 

3653
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:59,210
it's another to actually look at the
data and face the reality of it right I

3654
01:01:59,210 --> 01:01:59,220
data and face the reality of it right I
 

3655
01:01:59,220 --> 01:02:01,069
data and face the reality of it right I
I think also that could have a

3656
01:02:01,069 --> 01:02:01,079
I think also that could have a
 

3657
01:02:01,079 --> 01:02:03,049
I think also that could have a
psychological effect that is the other

3658
01:02:03,049 --> 01:02:03,059
psychological effect that is the other
 

3659
01:02:03,059 --> 01:02:04,730
psychological effect that is the other
thing that makes the whole Han situation

3660
01:02:04,730 --> 01:02:04,740
thing that makes the whole Han situation
 

3661
01:02:04,740 --> 01:02:07,309
thing that makes the whole Han situation
so tough because if you think that he's

3662
01:02:07,309 --> 01:02:07,319
so tough because if you think that he's
 

3663
01:02:07,319 --> 01:02:08,930
so tough because if you think that he's
cheated or you're unsure about what's

3664
01:02:08,930 --> 01:02:08,940
cheated or you're unsure about what's
 

3665
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:10,789
cheated or you're unsure about what's
going on that is another psychological

3666
01:02:10,789 --> 01:02:10,799
going on that is another psychological
 

3667
01:02:10,799 --> 01:02:13,069
going on that is another psychological
Factor whenever you play against it in

3668
01:02:13,069 --> 01:02:13,079
Factor whenever you play against it in
 

3669
01:02:13,079 --> 01:02:15,589
Factor whenever you play against it in
his favor or against a favor definitely

3670
01:02:15,589 --> 01:02:15,599
his favor or against a favor definitely
 

3671
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:18,829
his favor or against a favor definitely
in his favor because for example if I go

3672
01:02:18,829 --> 01:02:18,839
in his favor because for example if I go
 

3673
01:02:18,839 --> 01:02:19,970
in his favor because for example if I go
online and play against the computer

3674
01:02:19,970 --> 01:02:19,980
online and play against the computer
 

3675
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:21,530
online and play against the computer
let's just say I go play against sawfish

3676
01:02:21,530 --> 01:02:21,540
let's just say I go play against sawfish
 

3677
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:23,510
let's just say I go play against sawfish
tomorrow I'm gonna play a very certain

3678
01:02:23,510 --> 01:02:23,520
tomorrow I'm gonna play a very certain
 

3679
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:25,370
tomorrow I'm gonna play a very certain
type of opening strategy try to keep the

3680
01:02:25,370 --> 01:02:25,380
type of opening strategy try to keep the
 

3681
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:27,289
type of opening strategy try to keep the
board closed and maybe hope to get lucky

3682
01:02:27,289 --> 01:02:27,299
board closed and maybe hope to get lucky
 

3683
01:02:27,299 --> 01:02:28,970
board closed and maybe hope to get lucky
now computers have gotten so good that

3684
01:02:28,970 --> 01:02:28,980
now computers have gotten so good that
 

3685
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:30,950
now computers have gotten so good that
generally even that doesn't I don't even

3686
01:02:30,950 --> 01:02:30,960
generally even that doesn't I don't even
 

3687
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:32,630
generally even that doesn't I don't even
have a chance even with such strategies

3688
01:02:32,630 --> 01:02:32,640
have a chance even with such strategies
 

3689
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:34,910
have a chance even with such strategies
but you play differently than you

3690
01:02:34,910 --> 01:02:34,920
but you play differently than you
 

3691
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:36,770
but you play differently than you
normally would and so if you're playing

3692
01:02:36,770 --> 01:02:36,780
normally would and so if you're playing
 

3693
01:02:36,780 --> 01:02:38,210
normally would and so if you're playing
a game against him and there's a move

3694
01:02:38,210 --> 01:02:38,220
a game against him and there's a move
 

3695
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:39,950
a game against him and there's a move
that looks really weird

3696
01:02:39,950 --> 01:02:39,960
that looks really weird
 

3697
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:41,690
that looks really weird
um it doesn't seem logical at all that

3698
01:02:41,690 --> 01:02:41,700
um it doesn't seem logical at all that
 

3699
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:42,770
um it doesn't seem logical at all that
can also start to affect you where you

3700
01:02:42,770 --> 01:02:42,780
can also start to affect you where you
 

3701
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:44,450
can also start to affect you where you
immediately make a mistake or you start

3702
01:02:44,450 --> 01:02:44,460
immediately make a mistake or you start
 

3703
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:45,650
immediately make a mistake or you start
questioning yourself you start thinking

3704
01:02:45,650 --> 01:02:45,660
questioning yourself you start thinking
 

3705
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:47,450
questioning yourself you start thinking
well what's going on here is there

3706
01:02:47,450 --> 01:02:47,460
well what's going on here is there
 

3707
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:48,230
well what's going on here is there
something

3708
01:02:48,230 --> 01:02:48,240
something
 

3709
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:50,150
something

3725
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:09,770
in my heart of hearts I feel like there
had to be a better way to handle it than

3726
01:03:09,770 --> 01:03:09,780
had to be a better way to handle it than
 

3727
01:03:09,780 --> 01:03:12,770
had to be a better way to handle it than
what Magnus did on the other hand sort

3728
01:03:12,770 --> 01:03:12,780
what Magnus did on the other hand sort
 

3729
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:14,390
what Magnus did on the other hand sort
of being in this world of top Grand

3730
01:03:14,390 --> 01:03:14,400
of being in this world of top Grand
 

3731

of being in this world of top Grand
Masters having heard these rumors for

3732
01:03:16,130 --> 01:03:16,140
Masters having heard these rumors for
 

3733
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:19,190
Masters having heard these rumors for
two years I think that the fact that it

3734
01:03:19,190 --> 01:03:19,200
two years I think that the fact that it
 

3735
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:20,630
two years I think that the fact that it
was blown off and it wasn't treated

3736
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:20,640
was blown off and it wasn't treated
 

3737
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:22,370
was blown off and it wasn't treated
seriously I'm not sure if there was a

3738
01:03:22,370 --> 01:03:22,380
seriously I'm not sure if there was a
 

3739
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:23,870
seriously I'm not sure if there was a
better option so my heart of hearts I

3740
01:03:23,870 --> 01:03:23,880
better option so my heart of hearts I
 

3741
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:25,010
better option so my heart of hearts I
feel like there had to be a better way

3742
01:03:25,010 --> 01:03:25,020
feel like there had to be a better way
 

3743
01:03:25,020 --> 01:03:27,829
feel like there had to be a better way
to handle it but in practicality or like

3744
01:03:27,829 --> 01:03:27,839
to handle it but in practicality or like
 

3745
01:03:27,839 --> 01:03:29,390
to handle it but in practicality or like
in the Practical world

3746
01:03:29,390 --> 01:03:29,400
in the Practical world
 

3747
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:31,130
in the Practical world
I don't I think he might have made the

3748
01:03:31,130 --> 01:03:31,140
I don't I think he might have made the
 

3749
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:32,450
I don't I think he might have made the
only decision where it became a big

3750
01:03:32,450 --> 01:03:32,460
only decision where it became a big
 

3751
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:33,349
only decision where it became a big
issue

3752
01:03:33,349 --> 01:03:33,359
issue
 

3753
01:03:33,359 --> 01:03:36,770
issue
yeah I mean I guess I would have loved

3754
01:03:36,770 --> 01:03:36,780
yeah I mean I guess I would have loved
 

3755
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:40,549
yeah I mean I guess I would have loved
to see just where 100 it's certain that

3756
01:03:40,549 --> 01:03:40,559
to see just where 100 it's certain that
 

3757
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:41,930
to see just where 100 it's certain that
there's no cheating involved that they

3758
01:03:41,930 --> 01:03:41,940
there's no cheating involved that they
 

3759
01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:43,670
there's no cheating involved that they
play a bunch of games

3760
01:03:43,670 --> 01:03:43,680
play a bunch of games
 

3761
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:45,049
play a bunch of games
yeah I think there was actually an

3762
01:03:45,049 --> 01:03:45,059
yeah I think there was actually an
 

3763
01:03:45,059 --> 01:03:46,789
yeah I think there was actually an
article that was released today by uh

3764
01:03:46,789 --> 01:03:46,799
article that was released today by uh
 

3765
01:03:46,799 --> 01:03:49,010
article that was released today by uh
Ken rogoff who is a grand master at

3766
01:03:49,010 --> 01:03:49,020
Ken rogoff who is a grand master at
 

3767
01:03:49,020 --> 01:03:50,930
Ken rogoff who is a grand master at
chess where he wrote this article in the

3768
01:03:50,930 --> 01:03:50,940
chess where he wrote this article in the
 

3769
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:52,130
chess where he wrote this article in the
Boston Globe and he essentially said

3770
01:03:52,130 --> 01:03:52,140
Boston Globe and he essentially said
 

3771
01:03:52,140 --> 01:03:53,990
Boston Globe and he essentially said
that like have Hans and Magnus play a

3772
01:03:53,990 --> 01:03:54,000
that like have Hans and Magnus play a
 

3773
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,970
that like have Hans and Magnus play a
match and see what his score is because

3774
01:03:55,970 --> 01:03:55,980
match and see what his score is because
 

3775
01:03:55,980 --> 01:03:57,890
match and see what his score is because
statistically if it's above a certain

3776
01:03:57,890 --> 01:03:57,900
statistically if it's above a certain
 

3777
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:00,049
statistically if it's above a certain
percentage that means he's legitimate

3778
01:04:00,049 --> 01:04:00,059
percentage that means he's legitimate
 

3779
01:04:00,059 --> 01:04:02,210
percentage that means he's legitimate
because of course you have security

3780
01:04:02,210 --> 01:04:02,220
because of course you have security
 

3781
01:04:02,220 --> 01:04:03,950
because of course you have security
um if it's below that might mean that

3782
01:04:03,950 --> 01:04:03,960
um if it's below that might mean that
 

3783
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:05,450
um if it's below that might mean that
probably means that he's not at the

3784
01:04:05,450 --> 01:04:05,460
probably means that he's not at the
 

3785
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:06,289
probably means that he's not at the
level

3786
01:04:06,289 --> 01:04:06,299
level
 

3787
01:04:06,299 --> 01:04:07,730
level
um that he's at so I don't know if

3788
01:04:07,730 --> 01:04:07,740
um that he's at so I don't know if
 

3789
01:04:07,740 --> 01:04:09,109
um that he's at so I don't know if
that's a real way to settle it

3790
01:04:09,109 --> 01:04:09,119
that's a real way to settle it
 

3791
01:04:09,119 --> 01:04:10,250
that's a real way to settle it
necessarily

3792
01:04:10,250 --> 01:04:10,260
necessarily
 

3793
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:12,470
necessarily
um because also for Magnus to ask him to

3794
01:04:12,470 --> 01:04:12,480
um because also for Magnus to ask him to
 

3795
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:13,789
um because also for Magnus to ask him to
play against someone who's cheated I

3796
01:04:13,789 --> 01:04:13,799
play against someone who's cheated I
 

3797
01:04:13,799 --> 01:04:15,530
play against someone who's cheated I
think for him he just he would never

3798
01:04:15,530 --> 01:04:15,540
think for him he just he would never
 

3799
01:04:15,540 --> 01:04:17,690
think for him he just he would never
entertain the idea because it's like why

3800
01:04:17,690 --> 01:04:17,700
entertain the idea because it's like why
 

3801
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:18,650
entertain the idea because it's like why
am I going to play against someone who

3802
01:04:18,650 --> 01:04:18,660
am I going to play against someone who
 

3803
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:20,510
am I going to play against someone who
cheated so yeah I don't I don't know

3804
01:04:20,510 --> 01:04:20,520
cheated so yeah I don't I don't know
 

3805
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:22,250
cheated so yeah I don't I don't know
it's very tough and you know one one

3806
01:04:22,250 --> 01:04:22,260
it's very tough and you know one one
 

3807
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:24,049
it's very tough and you know one one
other thing I would say on the topic

3808
01:04:24,049 --> 01:04:24,059
other thing I would say on the topic
 

3809
01:04:24,059 --> 01:04:25,670
other thing I would say on the topic
that's really important to note is this

3810
01:04:25,670 --> 01:04:25,680
that's really important to note is this
 

3811
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:27,470
that's really important to note is this
sort of came from from left field for

3812
01:04:27,470 --> 01:04:27,480
sort of came from from left field for
 

3813
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:28,609
sort of came from from left field for
most people who are in the general

3814
01:04:28,609 --> 01:04:28,619
most people who are in the general
 

3815
01:04:28,619 --> 01:04:31,069
most people who are in the general
public are very casual chess players but

3816
01:04:31,069 --> 01:04:31,079
public are very casual chess players but
 

3817
01:04:31,079 --> 01:04:33,349
public are very casual chess players but
this is not something that wasn't known

3818
01:04:33,349 --> 01:04:33,359
this is not something that wasn't known
 

3819
01:04:33,359 --> 01:04:35,870
this is not something that wasn't known
wasn't even on the radar I I think this

3820
01:04:35,870 --> 01:04:35,880
wasn't even on the radar I I think this
 

3821
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:37,789
wasn't even on the radar I I think this
has not been said before but there's

3822
01:04:37,789 --> 01:04:37,799
has not been said before but there's
 

3823
01:04:37,799 --> 01:04:38,930
has not been said before but there's
there's one of these things where they

3824
01:04:38,930 --> 01:04:38,940
there's one of these things where they
 

3825
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:41,450
there's one of these things where they
talk about how Hans has uh he's he

3826
01:04:41,450 --> 01:04:41,460
talk about how Hans has uh he's he
 

3827
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:42,950
talk about how Hans has uh he's he
played better during a period of time

3828
01:04:42,950 --> 01:04:42,960
played better during a period of time
 

3829
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:45,170
played better during a period of time
when he games were broadcast versus not

3830
01:04:45,170 --> 01:04:45,180
when he games were broadcast versus not
 

3831
01:04:45,180 --> 01:04:47,450
when he games were broadcast versus not
broadcast I actually heard this rumor

3832
01:04:47,450 --> 01:04:47,460
broadcast I actually heard this rumor
 

3833
01:04:47,460 --> 01:04:49,849
broadcast I actually heard this rumor
two years ago during during one of the

3834
01:04:49,849 --> 01:04:49,859
two years ago during during one of the
 

3835
01:04:49,859 --> 01:04:52,309
two years ago during during one of the
terms he's playing specifically so that

3836
01:04:52,309 --> 01:04:52,319
terms he's playing specifically so that
 

3837
01:04:52,319 --> 01:04:53,750
terms he's playing specifically so that
is the thing is that this has been out

3838
01:04:53,750 --> 01:04:53,760
is the thing is that this has been out
 

3839
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:56,450
is the thing is that this has been out
there for a very long time and so it's

3840
01:04:56,450 --> 01:04:56,460
there for a very long time and so it's
 

3841
01:04:56,460 --> 01:04:58,309
there for a very long time and so it's
it's hard because you do believe that

3842
01:04:58,309 --> 01:04:58,319
it's hard because you do believe that
 

3843
01:04:58,319 --> 01:04:59,630
it's hard because you do believe that
Magus could have handled it better but

3844
01:04:59,630 --> 01:04:59,640
Magus could have handled it better but
 

3845
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:01,490
Magus could have handled it better but
if it was two years of these rumors and

3846
01:05:01,490 --> 01:05:01,500
if it was two years of these rumors and
 

3847
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:04,010
if it was two years of these rumors and
nothing was done about it I don't know

3848
01:05:04,010 --> 01:05:04,020
nothing was done about it I don't know
 

3849
01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:06,710
nothing was done about it I don't know
and for people who don't understand when

3850
01:05:06,710 --> 01:05:06,720
and for people who don't understand when
 

3851
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:08,510
and for people who don't understand when
it's broadcast it's easier to cheat

3852
01:05:08,510 --> 01:05:08,520
it's broadcast it's easier to cheat
 

3853
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:11,329
it's broadcast it's easier to cheat
because you can have

3854
01:05:11,329 --> 01:05:11,339
because you can have
 

3855
01:05:11,339 --> 01:05:14,030
because you can have
it removes one of the challenges of

3856
01:05:14,030 --> 01:05:14,040
it removes one of the challenges of
 

3857
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:15,589
it removes one of the challenges of
cheating which is the one-way

3858
01:05:15,589 --> 01:05:15,599
cheating which is the one-way
 

3859
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:18,410
cheating which is the one-way
communication from the board to the

3860
01:05:18,410 --> 01:05:18,420
communication from the board to the
 

3861
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:21,829
communication from the board to the
engine here the engine can just watch

3862
01:05:21,829 --> 01:05:21,839
engine here the engine can just watch
 

3863
01:05:21,839 --> 01:05:24,230
engine here the engine can just watch
the broadcast and then all you have to

3864
01:05:24,230 --> 01:05:24,240
the broadcast and then all you have to
 

3865
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:27,829
the broadcast and then all you have to
do is then signals right back uh I mean

3866
01:05:27,829 --> 01:05:27,839
do is then signals right back uh I mean
 

3867
01:05:27,839 --> 01:05:30,049
do is then signals right back uh I mean
that's really I've woken up to this fact

3868
01:05:30,049 --> 01:05:30,059
that's really I've woken up to this fact
 

3869
01:05:30,059 --> 01:05:32,569
that's really I've woken up to this fact
actually uh programmed so setting all

3870
01:05:32,569 --> 01:05:32,579
actually uh programmed so setting all
 

3871
01:05:32,579 --> 01:05:34,910

the silly sex toys aside
um I have uh

3874
01:05:36,890 --> 01:05:36,900
um I have uh
 

3875
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:38,870
um I have uh
I have a bunch of these devices so like

3876
01:05:38,870 --> 01:05:38,880
I have a bunch of these devices so like
 

3877
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:43,730
I have a bunch of these devices so like
of this um is the size of a coin and it

3878
01:05:43,730 --> 01:05:43,740
of this um is the size of a coin and it
 

3879
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:46,309
of this um is the size of a coin and it
has a high resolution vibration that you

3880
01:05:46,309 --> 01:05:46,319
has a high resolution vibration that you
 

3881
01:05:46,319 --> 01:05:48,109
has a high resolution vibration that you
can send so you can just have this in

3882
01:05:48,109 --> 01:05:48,119
can send so you can just have this in
 

3883
01:05:48,119 --> 01:05:49,670
can send so you can just have this in
your pocket it's basically what your

3884
01:05:49,670 --> 01:05:49,680
your pocket it's basically what your
 

3885
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:53,329
your pocket it's basically what your
your smartphone has ability to uh

3886
01:05:53,329 --> 01:05:53,339
your smartphone has ability to uh
 

3887
01:05:53,339 --> 01:05:54,950
your smartphone has ability to uh
vibrate you can do programmatic

3888
01:05:54,950 --> 01:05:54,960
vibrate you can do programmatic
 

3889
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:57,049
vibrate you can do programmatic
communication through anything Bluetooth

3890
01:05:57,049 --> 01:05:57,059
communication through anything Bluetooth
 

3891
01:05:57,059 --> 01:05:59,329
communication through anything Bluetooth
is the easiest so like this made me

3892
01:05:59,329 --> 01:05:59,339
is the easiest so like this made me
 

3893
01:05:59,339 --> 01:06:00,650
is the easiest so like this made me
wonder like

3894
01:06:00,650 --> 01:06:00,660
wonder like
 

3895
01:06:00,660 --> 01:06:03,190
wonder like
wait a minute how often does this happen

3896
01:06:03,190 --> 01:06:03,200
wait a minute how often does this happen
 

3897
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:05,750
wait a minute how often does this happen
like at every level of play and you said

3898
01:06:05,750 --> 01:06:05,760
like at every level of play and you said
 

3899
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:09,289
like at every level of play and you said
this only became a huge concern

3900
01:06:09,289 --> 01:06:09,299
this only became a huge concern
 

3901
01:06:09,299 --> 01:06:12,170
this only became a huge concern
for uh at the highest level of play but

3902
01:06:12,170 --> 01:06:12,180
for uh at the highest level of play but
 

3903
01:06:12,180 --> 01:06:13,970
for uh at the highest level of play but
then how much cheating is going on at

3904
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:13,980
then how much cheating is going on at
 

3905
01:06:13,980 --> 01:06:16,490
then how much cheating is going on at
like the the middle level of play

3906
01:06:16,490 --> 01:06:16,500
like the the middle level of play
 

3907
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:18,230
like the the middle level of play
especially when more money is involved

3908
01:06:18,230 --> 01:06:18,240
especially when more money is involved
 

3909
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:21,589
especially when more money is involved
so in the Game of Poker when like is it

3910
01:06:21,589 --> 01:06:21,599
so in the Game of Poker when like is it
 

3911
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:23,450
so in the Game of Poker when like is it
really

3912
01:06:23,450 --> 01:06:23,460
really
 

3913
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:25,609
really
um it really made me think like the

3914
01:06:25,609 --> 01:06:25,619
um it really made me think like the
 

3915
01:06:25,619 --> 01:06:28,309
um it really made me think like the
future will have devices like this much

3916
01:06:28,309 --> 01:06:28,319
future will have devices like this much
 

3917
01:06:28,319 --> 01:06:31,250
future will have devices like this much
easier to like you will engineer smaller

3918
01:06:31,250 --> 01:06:31,260
easier to like you will engineer smaller
 

3919
01:06:31,260 --> 01:06:33,470
easier to like you will engineer smaller
smaller and smaller devices that have

3920
01:06:33,470 --> 01:06:33,480
smaller and smaller devices that have
 

3921
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:35,210
smaller and smaller devices that have
onboard compute

3922
01:06:35,210 --> 01:06:35,220
onboard compute
 

3923
01:06:35,220 --> 01:06:37,010
onboard compute
that like

3924
01:06:37,010 --> 01:06:37,020
that like
 

3925
01:06:37,020 --> 01:06:39,650
that like
like this is the future I mean I I just

3926
01:06:39,650 --> 01:06:39,660
like this is the future I mean I I just
 

3927
01:06:39,660 --> 01:06:42,349
like this is the future I mean I I just
it makes me um I think probably with all

3928
01:06:42,349 --> 01:06:42,359
it makes me um I think probably with all
 

3929
01:06:42,359 --> 01:06:45,410
it makes me um I think probably with all
kinds of cyber security that means the

3930
01:06:45,410 --> 01:06:45,420
kinds of cyber security that means the
 

3931
01:06:45,420 --> 01:06:47,390
kinds of cyber security that means the
defense will just have to get started to

3932
01:06:47,390 --> 01:06:47,400
defense will just have to get started to
 

3933
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:49,250
defense will just have to get started to
get better even with chess it seems like

3934
01:06:49,250 --> 01:06:49,260
get better even with chess it seems like
 

3935
01:06:49,260 --> 01:06:52,309
get better even with chess it seems like
the security is very clumsy just looking

3936
01:06:52,309 --> 01:06:52,319
the security is very clumsy just looking
 

3937
01:06:52,319 --> 01:06:53,990
the security is very clumsy just looking
the scanning of the recent tournament

3938
01:06:53,990 --> 01:06:54,000
the scanning of the recent tournament
 

3939
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,250
the scanning of the recent tournament
one thing you'll see is there a lot of

3940
01:06:55,250 --> 01:06:55,260
one thing you'll see is there a lot of
 

3941
01:06:55,260 --> 01:06:56,210
one thing you'll see is there a lot of
people are talking about whether Hans

3942
01:06:56,210 --> 01:06:56,220
people are talking about whether Hans
 

3943
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:57,890
people are talking about whether Hans
has cheated or not the one thing that

3944
01:06:57,890 --> 01:06:57,900
has cheated or not the one thing that
 

3945
01:06:57,900 --> 01:06:59,390
has cheated or not the one thing that
almost nobody is doing is actually like

3946
01:06:59,390 --> 01:06:59,400
almost nobody is doing is actually like
 

3947
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:00,950
almost nobody is doing is actually like
trying to show how it can be done yeah

3948
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:00,960
trying to show how it can be done yeah
 

3949
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:02,690
trying to show how it can be done yeah
everyone's basically avoiding that I

3950
01:07:02,690 --> 01:07:02,700
everyone's basically avoiding that I
 

3951
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:04,609
everyone's basically avoiding that I
think the single biggest reason for that

3952
01:07:04,609 --> 01:07:04,619
think the single biggest reason for that
 

3953
01:07:04,619 --> 01:07:07,430
think the single biggest reason for that
is simply because it can be done very

3954
01:07:07,430 --> 01:07:07,440
is simply because it can be done very
 

3955
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,109
is simply because it can be done very
easily at like a weekend term if you

3956
01:07:09,109 --> 01:07:09,119
easily at like a weekend term if you
 

3957
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:10,970
easily at like a weekend term if you
play a weekend tournament where the top

3958
01:07:10,970 --> 01:07:10,980
play a weekend tournament where the top
 

3959
01:07:10,980 --> 01:07:12,230
play a weekend tournament where the top
prize is a hundred dollars and the

3960
01:07:12,230 --> 01:07:12,240
prize is a hundred dollars and the
 

3961
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:13,609
prize is a hundred dollars and the
players are maybe Master Level somebody

3962
01:07:13,609 --> 01:07:13,619
players are maybe Master Level somebody
 

3963
01:07:13,619 --> 01:07:15,890
players are maybe Master Level somebody
could already do this because even in St

3964
01:07:15,890 --> 01:07:15,900
could already do this because even in St
 

3965
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:17,150
could already do this because even in St
Louis now where they have the security

3966
01:07:17,150 --> 01:07:17,160
Louis now where they have the security
 

3967
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:19,849
Louis now where they have the security
my understanding is the one the um the

3968
01:07:19,849 --> 01:07:19,859
my understanding is the one the um the
 

3969
01:07:19,859 --> 01:07:21,710
my understanding is the one the um the
non-linear Junction device they bought

3970
01:07:21,710 --> 01:07:21,720
non-linear Junction device they bought
 

3971
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:24,289
non-linear Junction device they bought
costs about eleven thousand dollars

3972
01:07:24,289 --> 01:07:24,299
costs about eleven thousand dollars
 

3973
01:07:24,299 --> 01:07:26,150
costs about eleven thousand dollars
um and organizers if you if you have a

3974
01:07:26,150 --> 01:07:26,160
um and organizers if you if you have a
 

3975
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:28,130
um and organizers if you if you have a
weekend tournament at the at the local

3976
01:07:28,130 --> 01:07:28,140
weekend tournament at the at the local
 

3977
01:07:28,140 --> 01:07:29,809
weekend tournament at the at the local
Club you don't have eleven thousand

3978
01:07:29,809 --> 01:07:29,819
Club you don't have eleven thousand
 

3979
01:07:29,819 --> 01:07:32,690
Club you don't have eleven thousand
dollars to spend on such a device and so

3980
01:07:32,690 --> 01:07:32,700
dollars to spend on such a device and so
 

3981
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:34,309
dollars to spend on such a device and so
that is why a lot of people have been

3982
01:07:34,309 --> 01:07:34,319
that is why a lot of people have been
 

3983
01:07:34,319 --> 01:07:35,630
that is why a lot of people have been
talking about it but I think it is very

3984
01:07:35,630 --> 01:07:35,640
talking about it but I think it is very
 

3985
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:38,690
talking about it but I think it is very
very serious and it's that's why it is

3986
01:07:38,690 --> 01:07:38,700
very serious and it's that's why it is
 

3987
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:40,789
very serious and it's that's why it is
good even if you know aside from Hans

3988
01:07:40,789 --> 01:07:40,799
good even if you know aside from Hans
 

3989
01:07:40,799 --> 01:07:43,010
good even if you know aside from Hans
even it is a very important question or

3990
01:07:43,010 --> 01:07:43,020
even it is a very important question or
 

3991
01:07:43,020 --> 01:07:44,809
even it is a very important question or
debate to be having at the present

3992
01:07:44,809 --> 01:07:44,819
debate to be having at the present
 

3993
01:07:44,819 --> 01:07:46,970
debate to be having at the present
moment well I think I think it's good to

3994
01:07:46,970 --> 01:07:46,980
moment well I think I think it's good to
 

3995
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:48,829
moment well I think I think it's good to
talk about it right to make it so that

3996
01:07:48,829 --> 01:07:48,839
talk about it right to make it so that
 

3997
01:07:48,839 --> 01:07:50,690
talk about it right to make it so that
the defenses will really step up I think

3998
01:07:50,690 --> 01:07:50,700
the defenses will really step up I think
 

3999
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:52,190
the defenses will really step up I think
you could do pretty cheap like the

4000
01:07:52,190 --> 01:07:52,200
you could do pretty cheap like the
 

4001
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:55,730
you could do pretty cheap like the
security pretty cheaply uh but you have

4002
01:07:55,730 --> 01:07:55,740
security pretty cheaply uh but you have
 

4003
01:07:55,740 --> 01:07:58,430
security pretty cheaply uh but you have
to you take it seriously right right of

4004
01:07:58,430 --> 01:07:58,440
to you take it seriously right right of
 

4005
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:00,710
to you take it seriously right right of
course uh and again we'll we'll see what

4006
01:08:00,710 --> 01:08:00,720
course uh and again we'll we'll see what
 

4007
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:02,809
course uh and again we'll we'll see what
happens I think that's gonna end up

4008
01:08:02,809 --> 01:08:02,819
happens I think that's gonna end up
 

4009
01:08:02,819 --> 01:08:05,450
happens I think that's gonna end up
being on feed a more than anyone else to

4010
01:08:05,450 --> 01:08:05,460
being on feed a more than anyone else to
 

4011
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:07,190
being on feed a more than anyone else to
try and do that I I don't think asking

4012
01:08:07,190 --> 01:08:07,200
try and do that I I don't think asking
 

4013
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:08,750
try and do that I I don't think asking
the organizers to do it I mean I feel

4014
01:08:08,750 --> 01:08:08,760
the organizers to do it I mean I feel
 

4015
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:10,670
the organizers to do it I mean I feel
like fide they are the governing body it

4016
01:08:10,670 --> 01:08:10,680
like fide they are the governing body it
 

4017
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:12,349
like fide they are the governing body it
will be on them at the end of the day to

4018
01:08:12,349 --> 01:08:12,359
will be on them at the end of the day to
 

4019
01:08:12,359 --> 01:08:15,410
will be on them at the end of the day to
figure it out but it's uh it's gonna be

4020
01:08:15,410 --> 01:08:15,420
figure it out but it's uh it's gonna be
 

4021
01:08:15,420 --> 01:08:16,789
figure it out but it's uh it's gonna be
interesting to see what happens in the

4022
01:08:16,789 --> 01:08:16,799
interesting to see what happens in the
 

4023
01:08:16,799 --> 01:08:18,650
interesting to see what happens in the
next couple of months will you play Hans

4024
01:08:18,650 --> 01:08:18,660
next couple of months will you play Hans
 

4025
01:08:18,660 --> 01:08:21,410
next couple of months will you play Hans
if the opportunity arises well right now

4026
01:08:21,410 --> 01:08:21,420
if the opportunity arises well right now
 

4027
01:08:21,420 --> 01:08:23,809
if the opportunity arises well right now
that's not in the near future for me I

4028
01:08:23,809 --> 01:08:23,819
that's not in the near future for me I
 

4029
01:08:23,819 --> 01:08:26,329
that's not in the near future for me I
think fortunately why not uh well

4030
01:08:26,329 --> 01:08:26,339
think fortunately why not uh well
 

4031
01:08:26,339 --> 01:08:27,829
think fortunately why not uh well
because the there's maybe only one

4032
01:08:27,829 --> 01:08:27,839
because the there's maybe only one
 

4033
01:08:27,839 --> 01:08:29,570
because the there's maybe only one
tournament that I'm playing in that he

4034
01:08:29,570 --> 01:08:29,580
tournament that I'm playing in that he
 

4035
01:08:29,580 --> 01:08:30,950
tournament that I'm playing in that he
could be playing in potentially and it's

4036
01:08:30,950 --> 01:08:30,960
could be playing in potentially and it's
 

4037
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:32,749
could be playing in potentially and it's
not even set to be happening at the end

4038
01:08:32,749 --> 01:08:32,759
not even set to be happening at the end
 

4039
01:08:32,759 --> 01:08:33,890
not even set to be happening at the end
of the year there might be like a world

4040
01:08:33,890 --> 01:08:33,900
of the year there might be like a world
 

4041
01:08:33,900 --> 01:08:36,470
of the year there might be like a world
Blitz and Rapid Chess Championship so I

4042
01:08:36,470 --> 01:08:36,480
Blitz and Rapid Chess Championship so I
 

4043
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:44,110
Blitz and Rapid Chess Championship so I
don't think I'm gonna have to make

4044
01:08:44,110 --> 01:08:44,120

 

4045
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:49,010

the most famous super Grandmaster

4046
01:08:49,010 --> 01:08:49,020
the most famous super Grandmaster
 

4047
01:08:49,020 --> 01:08:51,349
the most famous super Grandmaster
in terms of online

4048
01:08:51,349 --> 01:08:51,359
in terms of online
 

4049
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:54,890
in terms of online
so it makes sense in terms of Chess is

4050
01:08:54,890 --> 01:08:54,900
so it makes sense in terms of Chess is
 

4051
01:08:54,900 --> 01:08:57,829
so it makes sense in terms of Chess is
going through a kind of um

4052
01:08:57,829 --> 01:08:57,839
going through a kind of um
 

4053
01:08:57,839 --> 01:09:00,410
going through a kind of um
like a serious controversy since it's

4054
01:09:00,410 --> 01:09:00,420
like a serious controversy since it's
 

4055
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:02,510
like a serious controversy since it's
not just like

4056
01:09:02,510 --> 01:09:02,520
not just like
 

4057
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:04,669
not just like
um the drama or something like this this

4058
01:09:04,669 --> 01:09:04,679
um the drama or something like this this
 

4059
01:09:04,679 --> 01:09:07,010
um the drama or something like this this
is in part an existential threat to the

4060
01:09:07,010 --> 01:09:07,020
is in part an existential threat to the
 

4061
01:09:07,020 --> 01:09:08,570
is in part an existential threat to the
game in terms of how the public

4062
01:09:08,570 --> 01:09:08,580
game in terms of how the public
 

4063
01:09:08,580 --> 01:09:11,150
game in terms of how the public
perceives the game yeah so if the story

4064
01:09:11,150 --> 01:09:11,160
perceives the game yeah so if the story
 

4065
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:13,669
perceives the game yeah so if the story
that lingers from this is chess is full

4066
01:09:13,669 --> 01:09:13,679
that lingers from this is chess is full
 

4067
01:09:13,679 --> 01:09:16,189
that lingers from this is chess is full
of cheaters like you never know who's

4068
01:09:16,189 --> 01:09:16,199
of cheaters like you never know who's
 

4069
01:09:16,199 --> 01:09:18,950
of cheaters like you never know who's
cheating or not that's not a good uh

4070
01:09:18,950 --> 01:09:18,960
cheating or not that's not a good uh
 

4071
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:20,809
cheating or not that's not a good uh
that's not good for the game so it makes

4072
01:09:20,809 --> 01:09:20,819
that's not good for the game so it makes
 

4073
01:09:20,819 --> 01:09:23,870
that's not good for the game so it makes
sense for a high profile person to to go

4074
01:09:23,870 --> 01:09:23,880
sense for a high profile person to to go
 

4075
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:26,390
sense for a high profile person to to go
head to head how do you think you do

4076
01:09:26,390 --> 01:09:26,400
head to head how do you think you do
 

4077
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:29,030
head to head how do you think you do
against odds I mean I I think I I think

4078
01:09:29,030 --> 01:09:29,040
against odds I mean I I think I I think
 

4079
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:30,829
against odds I mean I I think I I think
I would probably beat him in Blitz and

4080
01:09:30,829 --> 01:09:30,839
I would probably beat him in Blitz and
 

4081
01:09:30,839 --> 01:09:32,269
I would probably beat him in Blitz and
rap but classical is a whole different

4082
01:09:32,269 --> 01:09:32,279
rap but classical is a whole different
 

4083
01:09:32,279 --> 01:09:34,430
rap but classical is a whole different
question altogether I think in Blitz and

4084
01:09:34,430 --> 01:09:34,440
question altogether I think in Blitz and
 

4085
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:35,689
question altogether I think in Blitz and
Rapid I would I mean one thing actually

4086
01:09:35,689 --> 01:09:35,699
Rapid I would I mean one thing actually
 

4087
01:09:35,699 --> 01:09:38,689
Rapid I would I mean one thing actually
that was very telling in both report and

4088
01:09:38,689 --> 01:09:38,699
that was very telling in both report and
 

4089
01:09:38,699 --> 01:09:40,370
that was very telling in both report and
also hans's interview for all the other

4090
01:09:40,370 --> 01:09:40,380
also hans's interview for all the other
 

4091
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:41,749
also hans's interview for all the other
stuff it was said is the one thing he

4092
01:09:41,749 --> 01:09:41,759
stuff it was said is the one thing he
 

4093
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:43,309
stuff it was said is the one thing he
did say and seemed very adamant about

4094
01:09:43,309 --> 01:09:43,319
did say and seemed very adamant about
 

4095
01:09:43,319 --> 01:09:44,930
did say and seemed very adamant about
was the fact that he had never cheated

4096
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:44,940
was the fact that he had never cheated
 

4097
01:09:44,940 --> 01:09:47,870
was the fact that he had never cheated
against me which uh so that was the one

4098
01:09:47,870 --> 01:09:47,880
against me which uh so that was the one
 

4099
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:49,729
against me which uh so that was the one
thing he did say that at least according

4100
01:09:49,729 --> 01:09:49,739
thing he did say that at least according
 

4101
01:09:49,739 --> 01:09:51,950
thing he did say that at least according
to the report was truthful so it's

4102
01:09:51,950 --> 01:09:51,960
to the report was truthful so it's
 

4103
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:53,510
to the report was truthful so it's
something possibly down the road to

4104
01:09:53,510 --> 01:09:53,520
something possibly down the road to
 

4105
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:54,650
something possibly down the road to
consider

4106
01:09:54,650 --> 01:09:54,660
consider
 

4107
01:09:54,660 --> 01:09:56,930
consider
um but I do want to see what happens

4108
01:09:56,930 --> 01:09:56,940
um but I do want to see what happens
 

4109
01:09:56,940 --> 01:09:59,510
um but I do want to see what happens
with everything else first with fide and

4110
01:09:59,510 --> 01:09:59,520
with everything else first with fide and
 

4111
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:01,370
with everything else first with fide and
their their whatever they they choose to

4112
01:10:01,370 --> 01:10:01,380
their their whatever they they choose to
 

4113
01:10:01,380 --> 01:10:04,130
their their whatever they they choose to
do in regards to Hans and Magnus

4114
01:10:04,130 --> 01:10:04,140
do in regards to Hans and Magnus
 

4115
01:10:04,140 --> 01:10:06,050
do in regards to Hans and Magnus
um and and then see where see where the

4116
01:10:06,050 --> 01:10:06,060
um and and then see where see where the
 

4117
01:10:06,060 --> 01:10:09,290
um and and then see where see where the
smoke stands but I think also one other

4118
01:10:09,290 --> 01:10:09,300
smoke stands but I think also one other
 

4119
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:11,510
smoke stands but I think also one other
thing that is potentially very dangerous

4120
01:10:11,510 --> 01:10:11,520
thing that is potentially very dangerous
 

4121
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:13,130
thing that is potentially very dangerous
about the whole situation is that I'm

4122
01:10:13,130 --> 01:10:13,140
about the whole situation is that I'm
 

4123
01:10:13,140 --> 01:10:15,530
about the whole situation is that I'm
not convinced that fide actually is the

4124
01:10:15,530 --> 01:10:15,540
not convinced that fide actually is the
 

4125
01:10:15,540 --> 01:10:17,810
not convinced that fide actually is the
ultimate say in this in that the top

4126
01:10:17,810 --> 01:10:17,820
ultimate say in this in that the top
 

4127
01:10:17,820 --> 01:10:20,030
ultimate say in this in that the top
players if they if they feel that he has

4128
01:10:20,030 --> 01:10:20,040
players if they if they feel that he has
 

4129
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:21,530
players if they if they feel that he has
cheated over the board even if there's a

4130
01:10:21,530 --> 01:10:21,540
cheated over the board even if there's a
 

4131
01:10:21,540 --> 01:10:23,330
cheated over the board even if there's a
report that says he had that Hans has

4132
01:10:23,330 --> 01:10:23,340
report that says he had that Hans has
 

4133
01:10:23,340 --> 01:10:25,310
report that says he had that Hans has
not cheated top players can still decide

4134
01:10:25,310 --> 01:10:25,320
not cheated top players can still decide
 

4135
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:27,290
not cheated top players can still decide
not to play him and sort of override

4136
01:10:27,290 --> 01:10:27,300
not to play him and sort of override
 

4137
01:10:27,300 --> 01:10:29,270
not to play him and sort of override
what whatever ultimate decision feed it

4138
01:10:29,270 --> 01:10:29,280
what whatever ultimate decision feed it
 

4139
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:32,270
what whatever ultimate decision feed it
comes to so that's also why it's very

4140
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:32,280
comes to so that's also why it's very
 

4141
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:33,470
comes to so that's also why it's very
unclear

4142
01:10:33,470 --> 01:10:33,480
unclear
 

4143
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:34,430
unclear
um you know this term of the U.S

4144
01:10:34,430 --> 01:10:34,440
um you know this term of the U.S
 

4145
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:36,649
um you know this term of the U.S
Championship Hans qualified he's playing

4146
01:10:36,649 --> 01:10:36,659
Championship Hans qualified he's playing
 

4147
01:10:36,659 --> 01:10:38,570
Championship Hans qualified he's playing
the tournament but beyond this there are

4148
01:10:38,570 --> 01:10:38,580
the tournament but beyond this there are
 

4149
01:10:38,580 --> 01:10:40,310
the tournament but beyond this there are
no turns where he's automatically

4150
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:40,320
no turns where he's automatically
 

4151
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:42,950
no turns where he's automatically
qualified to and so it also is on the

4152
01:10:42,950 --> 01:10:42,960
qualified to and so it also is on the
 

4153
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:45,530
qualified to and so it also is on the
top players to sort of have to reach

4154
01:10:45,530 --> 01:10:45,540
top players to sort of have to reach
 

4155
01:10:45,540 --> 01:10:47,270
top players to sort of have to reach
some conclusion on their own separate of

4156
01:10:47,270 --> 01:10:47,280
some conclusion on their own separate of
 

4157
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:50,689
some conclusion on their own separate of
feeding so to flip that is there some

4158
01:10:50,689 --> 01:10:50,699
feeding so to flip that is there some
 

4159
01:10:50,699 --> 01:10:53,330
feeding so to flip that is there some
part of you that regrets

4160
01:10:53,330 --> 01:10:53,340
part of you that regrets
 

4161
01:10:53,340 --> 01:10:56,149
part of you that regrets
that the chess community and you

4162
01:10:56,149 --> 01:10:56,159
that the chess community and you
 

4163
01:10:56,159 --> 01:10:59,090
that the chess community and you
included implied that Hans cheated early

4164
01:10:59,090 --> 01:10:59,100
included implied that Hans cheated early
 

4165
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:03,050
included implied that Hans cheated early
on and I think without having evidence

4166
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:03,060
on and I think without having evidence
 

4167
01:11:03,060 --> 01:11:05,890
on and I think without having evidence
and that kind of thing as we learn now

4168
01:11:05,890 --> 01:11:05,900
and that kind of thing as we learn now
 

4169
01:11:05,900 --> 01:11:08,090
and that kind of thing as we learn now
can stick

4170
01:11:08,090 --> 01:11:08,100
can stick
 

4171
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:10,189
can stick
right and it kind of divided the chess

4172
01:11:10,189 --> 01:11:10,199
right and it kind of divided the chess
 

4173
01:11:10,199 --> 01:11:13,790
right and it kind of divided the chess
community in part but like

4174
01:11:13,790 --> 01:11:13,800

 

4175
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:14,570

um

4176
01:11:14,570 --> 01:11:14,580
um
 

4177
01:11:14,580 --> 01:11:17,689
um
I mean I guess I do want to empathize

4178
01:11:17,689 --> 01:11:17,699
I mean I guess I do want to empathize
 

4179
01:11:17,699 --> 01:11:19,189
I mean I guess I do want to empathize
from from your position can you

4180
01:11:19,189 --> 01:11:19,199
from from your position can you
 

4181
01:11:19,199 --> 01:11:21,110
from from your position can you
empathize with Hans that his reputation

4182
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:21,120
empathize with Hans that his reputation
 

4183
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:23,689
empathize with Hans that his reputation
is essentially in part or in whole

4184
01:11:23,689 --> 01:11:23,699
is essentially in part or in whole
 

4185
01:11:23,699 --> 01:11:26,209
is essentially in part or in whole
destroyed at this point yes I I

4186
01:11:26,209 --> 01:11:26,219
destroyed at this point yes I I
 

4187
01:11:26,219 --> 01:11:28,189
destroyed at this point yes I I
absolutely can again I think it comes

4188
01:11:28,189 --> 01:11:28,199
absolutely can again I think it comes
 

4189
01:11:28,199 --> 01:11:30,530
absolutely can again I think it comes
down to the specifics of how how it was

4190
01:11:30,530 --> 01:11:30,540
down to the specifics of how how it was
 

4191
01:11:30,540 --> 01:11:33,530
down to the specifics of how how it was
handled now as far as I go I was

4192
01:11:33,530 --> 01:11:33,540
handled now as far as I go I was
 

4193
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:35,510
handled now as far as I go I was
covering the news and this is what makes

4194
01:11:35,510 --> 01:11:35,520
covering the news and this is what makes
 

4195
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:37,490
covering the news and this is what makes
it so difficult for me versus say some

4196
01:11:37,490 --> 01:11:37,500
it so difficult for me versus say some
 

4197
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:39,709
it so difficult for me versus say some
of the other content creators is that I

4198
01:11:39,709 --> 01:11:39,719
of the other content creators is that I
 

4199
01:11:39,719 --> 01:11:42,050
of the other content creators is that I
do in a sense have that inside knowledge

4200
01:11:42,050 --> 01:11:42,060
do in a sense have that inside knowledge
 

4201
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:44,270
do in a sense have that inside knowledge
um you know again this is probably this

4202
01:11:44,270 --> 01:11:44,280
um you know again this is probably this
 

4203
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:45,709
um you know again this is probably this
is also not really public knowledge but

4204
01:11:45,709 --> 01:11:45,719
is also not really public knowledge but
 

4205
01:11:45,719 --> 01:11:47,570
is also not really public knowledge but
when I went to St Louis to play this

4206
01:11:47,570 --> 01:11:47,580
when I went to St Louis to play this
 

4207
01:11:47,580 --> 01:11:49,189
when I went to St Louis to play this
rapid and Blitz tournament before the

4208
01:11:49,189 --> 01:11:49,199
rapid and Blitz tournament before the
 

4209
01:11:49,199 --> 01:11:50,689
rapid and Blitz tournament before the
sinkhole cup happened where Magus and

4210
01:11:50,689 --> 01:11:50,699
sinkhole cup happened where Magus and
 

4211
01:11:50,699 --> 01:11:52,250
sinkhole cup happened where Magus and
Hans were playing there were people who

4212
01:11:52,250 --> 01:11:52,260
Hans were playing there were people who
 

4213
01:11:52,260 --> 01:11:53,689
Hans were playing there were people who
told me very specifically that they

4214
01:11:53,689 --> 01:11:53,699
told me very specifically that they
 

4215
01:11:53,699 --> 01:11:55,070
told me very specifically that they
thought he was cheating other other

4216
01:11:55,070 --> 01:11:55,080
thought he was cheating other other
 

4217
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:56,870
thought he was cheating other other
players in the event they even gave me

4218
01:11:56,870 --> 01:11:56,880
players in the event they even gave me
 

4219
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:58,610
players in the event they even gave me
like actual theories about like things

4220
01:11:58,610 --> 01:11:58,620
like actual theories about like things
 

4221
01:11:58,620 --> 01:12:00,530
like actual theories about like things
in his shoes things of this nature yeah

4222
01:12:00,530 --> 01:12:00,540
in his shoes things of this nature yeah
 

4223
01:12:00,540 --> 01:12:02,750
in his shoes things of this nature yeah
so I'm in a very awkward spot there as

4224
01:12:02,750 --> 01:12:02,760
so I'm in a very awkward spot there as
 

4225
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:05,930
so I'm in a very awkward spot there as
well because I know why I mean I I was

4226
01:12:05,930 --> 01:12:05,940
well because I know why I mean I I was
 

4227
01:12:05,940 --> 01:12:09,050
well because I know why I mean I I was
like 99 sure why Magnus dropped out

4228
01:12:09,050 --> 01:12:09,060
like 99 sure why Magnus dropped out
 

4229
01:12:09,060 --> 01:12:11,030
like 99 sure why Magnus dropped out
um it would have come out regardless

4230
01:12:11,030 --> 01:12:11,040
um it would have come out regardless
 

4231
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:12,770
um it would have come out regardless
though it would have come out no matter

4232
01:12:12,770 --> 01:12:12,780
though it would have come out no matter
 

4233
01:12:12,780 --> 01:12:14,450
though it would have come out no matter
what because Magnus was not going to

4234
01:12:14,450 --> 01:12:14,460
what because Magnus was not going to
 

4235
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:17,870
what because Magnus was not going to
back down on a stance about Hans and

4236
01:12:17,870 --> 01:12:17,880
back down on a stance about Hans and
 

4237
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:19,550
back down on a stance about Hans and
others would have brought it up anyways

4238
01:12:19,550 --> 01:12:19,560
others would have brought it up anyways
 

4239
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:20,510
others would have brought it up anyways
so

4240
01:12:20,510 --> 01:12:20,520
so
 

4241
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:23,209
so
it's it's very tough I think if if you

4242
01:12:23,209 --> 01:12:23,219
it's it's very tough I think if if you
 

4243
01:12:23,219 --> 01:12:25,490
it's it's very tough I think if if you
want to look for for blame I think

4244
01:12:25,490 --> 01:12:25,500
want to look for for blame I think
 

4245
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:27,530
want to look for for blame I think
probably it would be on chess.com

4246
01:12:27,530 --> 01:12:27,540
probably it would be on chess.com
 

4247
01:12:27,540 --> 01:12:30,050
probably it would be on chess.com
ultimately because they were the ones

4248
01:12:30,050 --> 01:12:30,060
ultimately because they were the ones
 

4249
01:12:30,060 --> 01:12:31,490
ultimately because they were the ones
who probably could have nipped all this

4250
01:12:31,490 --> 01:12:31,500
who probably could have nipped all this
 

4251
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:33,709
who probably could have nipped all this
in the bud at a much earlier stage and

4252
01:12:33,709 --> 01:12:33,719
in the bud at a much earlier stage and
 

4253
01:12:33,719 --> 01:12:34,970
in the bud at a much earlier stage and
it wouldn't have gotten to where it got

4254
01:12:34,970 --> 01:12:34,980
it wouldn't have gotten to where it got
 

4255
01:12:34,980 --> 01:12:36,830
it wouldn't have gotten to where it got
to because they could have released the

4256
01:12:36,830 --> 01:12:36,840
to because they could have released the
 

4257
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:39,110
to because they could have released the
online cheating and that would have I

4258
01:12:39,110 --> 01:12:39,120
online cheating and that would have I
 

4259
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:40,430
online cheating and that would have I
think yeah I think they could have

4260
01:12:40,430 --> 01:12:40,440
think yeah I think they could have
 

4261
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:42,350
think yeah I think they could have
released that I think also they could

4262
01:12:42,350 --> 01:12:42,360
released that I think also they could
 

4263
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:44,750
released that I think also they could
have probably not let him play after it

4264
01:12:44,750 --> 01:12:44,760
have probably not let him play after it
 

4265
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:46,790
have probably not let him play after it
happened uh the second time as well

4266
01:12:46,790 --> 01:12:46,800
happened uh the second time as well
 

4267
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:48,530
happened uh the second time as well
because it seems like it happened like I

4268
01:12:48,530 --> 01:12:48,540
because it seems like it happened like I
 

4269
01:12:48,540 --> 01:12:49,910
because it seems like it happened like I
I don't I think it was like at least

4270
01:12:49,910 --> 01:12:49,920
I don't I think it was like at least
 

4271
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:52,070
I don't I think it was like at least
like four or five different times I

4272
01:12:52,070 --> 01:12:52,080
like four or five different times I
 

4273
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:53,570
like four or five different times I
haven't looked very very closely at that

4274
01:12:53,570 --> 01:12:53,580
haven't looked very very closely at that
 

4275
01:12:53,580 --> 01:12:55,850
haven't looked very very closely at that
but it wasn't just an isolated incident

4276
01:12:55,850 --> 01:12:55,860
but it wasn't just an isolated incident
 

4277
01:12:55,860 --> 01:12:58,430
but it wasn't just an isolated incident
and so I think if there is blame for

4278
01:12:58,430 --> 01:12:58,440
and so I think if there is blame for
 

4279
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:00,410
and so I think if there is blame for
that it's definitely on trust.com which

4280
01:13:00,410 --> 01:13:00,420
that it's definitely on trust.com which
 

4281
01:13:00,420 --> 01:13:02,930
that it's definitely on trust.com which
should uh stop people from thinking that

4282
01:13:02,930 --> 01:13:02,940
should uh stop people from thinking that
 

4283
01:13:02,940 --> 01:13:04,850
should uh stop people from thinking that
like my that I'm in some way influenced

4284
01:13:04,850 --> 01:13:04,860
like my that I'm in some way influenced
 

4285
01:13:04,860 --> 01:13:07,430
like my that I'm in some way influenced

4293
01:13:14,340 --> 01:13:16,490
bias no it doesn't I'm actually quite
independent of them one thing that's

4294
01:13:16,490 --> 01:13:16,500
independent of them one thing that's
 

4295
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:19,070
independent of them one thing that's
that's interesting um to note is that a

4296
01:13:19,070 --> 01:13:19,080
that's interesting um to note is that a
 

4297
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:20,209
that's interesting um to note is that a
lot of people are under the assumption

4298
01:13:20,209 --> 01:13:20,219
lot of people are under the assumption
 

4299
01:13:20,219 --> 01:13:21,709
lot of people are under the assumption
that when I do like broadcast of

4303
01:13:22,980 --> 01:13:25,070
tournaments or things of this nature
that chess.com is actively helping me

4304
01:13:25,070 --> 01:13:25,080
that chess.com is actively helping me

anything of this nature that has always
been completely separate do they have

4316
01:13:37,010 --> 01:13:37,020
been completely separate do they have

4321
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:45,229
you forces you to uh if you don't follow
the the main narrative that they will

4322
01:13:45,229 --> 01:13:45,239
the the main narrative that they will
 

4323
01:13:45,239 --> 01:13:47,330
the the main narrative that they will
release that video publicly no they

4324
01:13:47,330 --> 01:13:47,340
release that video publicly no they
 

4325
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:48,890
release that video publicly no they
definitely don't

01:13:48,890 --> 01:13:48,900
definitely don't
 

4327
01:13:48,900 --> 01:13:53,209
definitely don't
um but yeah I I think I I think when I

01:13:53,209 --> 01:13:53,219
um but yeah I I think I I think when I
 

4329
01:13:53,219 --> 01:13:56,270
um but yeah I I think I I think when I
look look at it all I feel like if there

4330
01:13:56,270 --> 01:13:56,280
look look at it all I feel like if there
 

4331
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:58,490
look look at it all I feel like if there
is if if people are looking for for

4332
01:13:58,490 --> 01:13:58,500
is if if people are looking for for
 

4333
01:13:58,500 --> 01:13:59,750
is if if people are looking for for
someone to blame I don't think it's

4334
01:13:59,750 --> 01:13:59,760
someone to blame I don't think it's
 

4335
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:01,490
someone to blame I don't think it's
actually Magnus the other day I think it

4336
01:14:01,490 --> 01:14:01,500
actually Magnus the other day I think it
 

4337
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:04,070
actually Magnus the other day I think it
is it's on chess.com very squarely for

4338
01:14:04,070 --> 01:14:04,080
is it's on chess.com very squarely for
 

4339
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:06,290
is it's on chess.com very squarely for
not handling handling it sooner I see

4340
01:14:06,290 --> 01:14:06,300
not handling handling it sooner I see
 

4341
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:08,510
not handling handling it sooner I see
you're okay with like Magnus being

4342
01:14:08,510 --> 01:14:08,520
you're okay with like Magnus being
 

4343
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:11,510
you're okay with like Magnus being
silent for long periods of time well I

4344
01:14:11,510 --> 01:14:11,520
silent for long periods of time well I
 

4345
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:13,970
silent for long periods of time well I
don't know why Magnus is still silent

4346
01:14:13,970 --> 01:14:13,980
don't know why Magnus is still silent
 

4347
01:14:13,980 --> 01:14:16,010
don't know why Magnus is still silent
because my read of the situation was

4348
01:14:16,010 --> 01:14:16,020
because my read of the situation was
 

4349
01:14:16,020 --> 01:14:17,510
because my read of the situation was
that there was some sort of NDA or

4350
01:14:17,510 --> 01:14:17,520
that there was some sort of NDA or
 

4351
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:19,850
that there was some sort of NDA or
there's some information that chess.com

4352
01:14:19,850 --> 01:14:19,860
there's some information that chess.com
 

4353
01:14:19,860 --> 01:14:21,950
there's some information that chess.com
had that was they they could not release

4354
01:14:21,950 --> 01:14:21,960
had that was they they could not release
 

4355
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:24,229
had that was they they could not release
and so my read of it was Magnus was

4356
01:14:24,229 --> 01:14:24,239
and so my read of it was Magnus was
 

4357
01:14:24,239 --> 01:14:25,250
and so my read of it was Magnus was
essentially saying the same thing

4358
01:14:25,250 --> 01:14:25,260
essentially saying the same thing
 

4359
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:27,590
essentially saying the same thing
chess.com said where like I can't say

4360
01:14:27,590 --> 01:14:27,600
chess.com said where like I can't say
 

4361
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:29,990
chess.com said where like I can't say
anything about it because of whatever

4362
01:14:29,990 --> 01:14:30,000
anything about it because of whatever
 

4363
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,810
anything about it because of whatever
whatnot but then chess.com releases what

4364
01:14:32,810 --> 01:14:32,820
whatnot but then chess.com releases what
 

4365
01:14:32,820 --> 01:14:34,130
whatnot but then chess.com releases what
I perceive to be the stuff that they

4366
01:14:34,130 --> 01:14:34,140
I perceive to be the stuff that they
 

4367
01:14:34,140 --> 01:14:36,590
I perceive to be the stuff that they
could not talk about anyway and Magnus

4368
01:14:36,590 --> 01:14:36,600
could not talk about anyway and Magnus
 

4369
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:38,510
could not talk about anyway and Magnus
still isn't saying anything so I don't

4370
01:14:38,510 --> 01:14:38,520
still isn't saying anything so I don't
 

4371
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:41,030
still isn't saying anything so I don't
really understand why Magnus has not

4372
01:14:41,030 --> 01:14:41,040
really understand why Magnus has not
 

4373
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:42,410
really understand why Magnus has not
said anything further there could be

4374
01:14:42,410 --> 01:14:42,420
said anything further there could be
 

4375
01:14:42,420 --> 01:14:44,570
said anything further there could be
legal implications of accusing somebody

4376
01:14:44,570 --> 01:14:44,580
legal implications of accusing somebody
 

4377
01:14:44,580 --> 01:14:47,810
legal implications of accusing somebody
of cheating uh over the board that could

4378
01:14:47,810 --> 01:14:47,820
of cheating uh over the board that could
 

4379
01:14:47,820 --> 01:14:50,390
of cheating uh over the board that could
be like lawsuits that he just doesn't

4380
01:14:50,390 --> 01:14:50,400
be like lawsuits that he just doesn't
 

4381
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:51,709
be like lawsuits that he just doesn't
want the headaches he just wants to

4382
01:14:51,709 --> 01:14:51,719
want the headaches he just wants to
 

4383
01:14:51,719 --> 01:14:53,330
want the headaches he just wants to
focus on the game and have fun playing

4384
01:14:53,330 --> 01:14:53,340
focus on the game and have fun playing
 

4385
01:14:53,340 --> 01:14:56,570
focus on the game and have fun playing
the game and not get bogged down into

4386
01:14:56,570 --> 01:14:56,580
the game and not get bogged down into
 

4387
01:14:56,580 --> 01:14:58,729
the game and not get bogged down into
lawyers and all that kind of yeah it's

4388
01:14:58,729 --> 01:14:58,739
lawyers and all that kind of yeah it's
 

4389
01:14:58,739 --> 01:15:01,310
lawyers and all that kind of yeah it's
definitely possible but Magnus could

4390
01:15:01,310 --> 01:15:01,320
definitely possible but Magnus could
 

4391
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:02,390
definitely possible but Magnus could
also take the other route and just say

4392
01:15:02,390 --> 01:15:02,400
also take the other route and just say
 

4393
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:04,310
also take the other route and just say
well he cheated online in 100 games like

4394
01:15:04,310 --> 01:15:04,320
well he cheated online in 100 games like
 

4395
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:05,510
well he cheated online in 100 games like
I'm not going to play against a cheater

4396
01:15:05,510 --> 01:15:05,520
I'm not going to play against a cheater
 

4397
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:07,430
I'm not going to play against a cheater
that's very easy to say that's factual

4398
01:15:07,430 --> 01:15:07,440
that's very easy to say that's factual
 

4399
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:09,950
that's very easy to say that's factual
it's proven and that doesn't have to go

4400
01:15:09,950 --> 01:15:09,960
it's proven and that doesn't have to go
 

4401
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:12,709
it's proven and that doesn't have to go
into the speculation over the board so I

4402
01:15:12,709 --> 01:15:12,719
into the speculation over the board so I
 

4403
01:15:12,719 --> 01:15:14,330
into the speculation over the board so I
I find it a little bit odd that Magnus

4404
01:15:14,330 --> 01:15:14,340
I find it a little bit odd that Magnus
 

4405
01:15:14,340 --> 01:15:15,890
I find it a little bit odd that Magnus
hasn't said anything further at the same

4406
01:15:15,890 --> 01:15:15,900
hasn't said anything further at the same
 

4407
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:17,630
hasn't said anything further at the same
time it's also kind of peculiar because

4408
01:15:17,630 --> 01:15:17,640
time it's also kind of peculiar because
 

4409
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:20,990
time it's also kind of peculiar because
magnus's reputation is also kind of in

4410
01:15:20,990 --> 01:15:21,000
magnus's reputation is also kind of in
 

4411
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,550
magnus's reputation is also kind of in
in tatters in a sense like a lot of

4412
01:15:22,550 --> 01:15:22,560
in tatters in a sense like a lot of
 

4413
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:23,930
in tatters in a sense like a lot of
people are not happy with them for what

4414
01:15:23,930 --> 01:15:23,940
people are not happy with them for what
 

4415
01:15:23,940 --> 01:15:26,090
people are not happy with them for what
he's done uh but still he goes and plays

4416
01:15:26,090 --> 01:15:26,100
he's done uh but still he goes and plays
 

4417
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:27,709
he's done uh but still he goes and plays
this tournament in this European Club

4418
01:15:27,709 --> 01:15:27,719
this tournament in this European Club
 

4419
01:15:27,719 --> 01:15:29,330
this tournament in this European Club
Cup Tournament and he's just gaining

4420
01:15:29,330 --> 01:15:29,340
Cup Tournament and he's just gaining
 

4421
01:15:29,340 --> 01:15:30,950
Cup Tournament and he's just gaining
like 10 points as though nothing has

4422
01:15:30,950 --> 01:15:30,960
like 10 points as though nothing has
 

4423
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:33,830
like 10 points as though nothing has
happened so I I mean I I don't I don't I

4424
01:15:33,830 --> 01:15:33,840
happened so I I mean I I don't I don't I
 

4425
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:35,570
happened so I I mean I I don't I don't I
don't really know where magnus's head is

4426
01:15:35,570 --> 01:15:35,580
don't really know where magnus's head is
 

4427
01:15:35,580 --> 01:15:37,370
don't really know where magnus's head is
at because like if I was in that

4428
01:15:37,370 --> 01:15:37,380
at because like if I was in that
 

4429
01:15:37,380 --> 01:15:39,649
at because like if I was in that
situation and everyone's coming after me

4430
01:15:39,649 --> 01:15:39,659
situation and everyone's coming after me
 

4431
01:15:39,659 --> 01:15:41,209
situation and everyone's coming after me
for making such an accusation I don't

4432
01:15:41,209 --> 01:15:41,219
for making such an accusation I don't
 

4433
01:15:41,219 --> 01:15:42,649
for making such an accusation I don't
think there's any way I'd be I would be

4434
01:15:42,649 --> 01:15:42,659
think there's any way I'd be I would be
 

4435
01:15:42,659 --> 01:15:44,510
think there's any way I'd be I would be
able to play chess anywhere near the

4436
01:15:44,510 --> 01:15:44,520
able to play chess anywhere near the
 

4437
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:46,910
able to play chess anywhere near the
level that Magnus is playing at so the

4438
01:15:46,910 --> 01:15:46,920
level that Magnus is playing at so the
 

4439
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:48,649
level that Magnus is playing at so the
whole situation is yeah it's very

4440
01:15:48,649 --> 01:15:48,659
whole situation is yeah it's very
 

4441
01:15:48,659 --> 01:15:50,990
whole situation is yeah it's very
strange yeah I wonder where his mind is

4442
01:15:50,990 --> 01:15:51,000
strange yeah I wonder where his mind is
 

4443
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,490
strange yeah I wonder where his mind is
at that he's able to play at that level

4444
01:15:52,490 --> 01:15:52,500
at that he's able to play at that level
 

4445
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:55,189
at that he's able to play at that level
uh let me uh before I forget let me ask

4446
01:15:55,189 --> 01:15:55,199
uh let me uh before I forget let me ask
 

4447
01:15:55,199 --> 01:15:56,689
uh let me uh before I forget let me ask
you a technical question about cheating

4448
01:15:56,689 --> 01:15:56,699
you a technical question about cheating
 

4449
01:15:56,699 --> 01:15:59,630
you a technical question about cheating
for at your level at like not your level

4450
01:15:59,630 --> 01:15:59,640
for at your level at like not your level
 

4451
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:02,450
for at your level at like not your level
but at a very high Grandmaster level how

4452
01:16:02,450 --> 01:16:02,460
but at a very high Grandmaster level how
 

4453
01:16:02,460 --> 01:16:04,669
but at a very high Grandmaster level how
much information do you need this is a

4454
01:16:04,669 --> 01:16:04,679
much information do you need this is a
 

4455
01:16:04,679 --> 01:16:07,130
much information do you need this is a
technical question it's like so for me

4456
01:16:07,130 --> 01:16:07,140
technical question it's like so for me
 

4457
01:16:07,140 --> 01:16:09,229
technical question it's like so for me
in terms of Morse code and all those

4458
01:16:09,229 --> 01:16:09,239
in terms of Morse code and all those
 

4459
01:16:09,239 --> 01:16:11,630
in terms of Morse code and all those
kinds of things I would need

4460
01:16:11,630 --> 01:16:11,640
kinds of things I would need
 

4461
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:13,610
kinds of things I would need
the full information so I would need

4462
01:16:13,610 --> 01:16:13,620
the full information so I would need
 

4463
01:16:13,620 --> 01:16:16,490
the full information so I would need
probably in order to make a move

4464
01:16:16,490 --> 01:16:16,500
probably in order to make a move
 

4465
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:18,770
probably in order to make a move
just let's think about a very simple

4466
01:16:18,770 --> 01:16:18,780
just let's think about a very simple
 

4467
01:16:18,780 --> 01:16:21,370
just let's think about a very simple
representation I would need two squares

4468
01:16:21,370 --> 01:16:21,380
representation I would need two squares
 

4469
01:16:21,380 --> 01:16:25,070
representation I would need two squares
or the first to to designate which piece

4470
01:16:25,070 --> 01:16:25,080
or the first to to designate which piece
 

4471
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:27,229
or the first to to designate which piece
and the second where the piece is moving

4472
01:16:27,229 --> 01:16:27,239
and the second where the piece is moving
 

4473
01:16:27,239 --> 01:16:29,209
and the second where the piece is moving
that's probably the easiest

4474
01:16:29,209 --> 01:16:29,219
that's probably the easiest
 

4475
01:16:29,219 --> 01:16:31,010
that's probably the easiest
what's the smallest amount of

4476
01:16:31,010 --> 01:16:31,020
what's the smallest amount of
 

4477
01:16:31,020 --> 01:16:33,310
what's the smallest amount of
information you need to help you

4478
01:16:33,310 --> 01:16:33,320
information you need to help you
 

4479
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:35,570
information you need to help you
basically like a buzz in a critical

4480
01:16:35,570 --> 01:16:35,580
basically like a buzz in a critical
 

4481
01:16:35,580 --> 01:16:37,130
basically like a buzz in a critical
position that would be and what would

4482
01:16:37,130 --> 01:16:37,140
position that would be and what would
 

4483
01:16:37,140 --> 01:16:39,229
position that would be and what would
the buzz say it would it basically would

4484
01:16:39,229 --> 01:16:39,239
the buzz say it would it basically would
 

4485
01:16:39,239 --> 01:16:40,790
the buzz say it would it basically would
be something like one Buzz means the

4486
01:16:40,790 --> 01:16:40,800
be something like one Buzz means the
 

4487
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:43,189
be something like one Buzz means the
position is is great and two buzzes

4488
01:16:43,189 --> 01:16:43,199
position is is great and two buzzes
 

4489
01:16:43,199 --> 01:16:44,510
position is is great and two buzzes
means the position is completely it's

4490
01:16:44,510 --> 01:16:44,520
means the position is completely it's
 

4491
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:46,010
means the position is completely it's
completely equal or there's nothing

4492
01:16:46,010 --> 01:16:46,020
completely equal or there's nothing
 

4493
01:16:46,020 --> 01:16:48,110
completely equal or there's nothing
special in the position oh that's simple

4494
01:16:48,110 --> 01:16:48,120
special in the position oh that's simple
 

4495
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:50,209
special in the position oh that's simple
just to know that it's great we'll tell

4496
01:16:50,209 --> 01:16:50,219
just to know that it's great we'll tell
 

4497
01:16:50,219 --> 01:16:52,490
just to know that it's great we'll tell
you what it will tell me that like my my

4498
01:16:52,490 --> 01:16:52,500
you what it will tell me that like my my
 

4499
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:54,350
you what it will tell me that like my my
in with my intuition like there are many

4500
01:16:54,350 --> 01:16:54,360
in with my intuition like there are many
 

4501
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:55,910
in with my intuition like there are many
times I've played Blitz online I'll say

4502
01:16:55,910 --> 01:16:55,920
times I've played Blitz online I'll say
 

4503
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:57,169
times I've played Blitz online I'll say
something I'll say something along the

4504
01:16:57,169 --> 01:16:57,179
something I'll say something along the
 

4505
01:16:57,179 --> 01:16:58,430
something I'll say something along the
lines of I can feel like there's

4506
01:16:58,430 --> 01:16:58,440
lines of I can feel like there's
 

4507
01:16:58,440 --> 01:17:00,050
lines of I can feel like there's
something here like intuitively I feel

4508
01:17:00,050 --> 01:17:00,060
something here like intuitively I feel
 

4509
01:17:00,060 --> 01:17:01,490
something here like intuitively I feel
like there has to be a good move or I'm

4510
01:17:01,490 --> 01:17:01,500
like there has to be a good move or I'm
 

4511
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:03,110
like there has to be a good move or I'm
probably winning there's something there

4512
01:17:03,110 --> 01:17:03,120
probably winning there's something there
 

4513
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:05,330
probably winning there's something there
but I don't know that and most of the

4514
01:17:05,330 --> 01:17:05,340
but I don't know that and most of the
 

4515
01:17:05,340 --> 01:17:06,709
but I don't know that and most of the
time I'm actually right about it like

4516
01:17:06,709 --> 01:17:06,719
time I'm actually right about it like
 

4517
01:17:06,719 --> 01:17:07,970
time I'm actually right about it like
well after the game when I look with the

4518
01:17:07,970 --> 01:17:07,980
well after the game when I look with the
 

4519
01:17:07,980 --> 01:17:09,050
well after the game when I look with the
computer usually it's like oh I should

4520
01:17:09,050 --> 01:17:09,060
computer usually it's like oh I should
 

4521
01:17:09,060 --> 01:17:10,669
computer usually it's like oh I should
have played this this move and it would

4522
01:17:10,669 --> 01:17:10,679
have played this this move and it would
 

4523
01:17:10,679 --> 01:17:12,169
have played this this move and it would
have given me a big advantage or I would

4524
01:17:12,169 --> 01:17:12,179
have given me a big advantage or I would
 

4525
01:17:12,179 --> 01:17:14,209
have given me a big advantage or I would
have outright won the game so if I just

4526
01:17:14,209 --> 01:17:14,219
have outright won the game so if I just
 

4527
01:17:14,219 --> 01:17:15,890
have outright won the game so if I just
know whether there's something there

4528
01:17:15,890 --> 01:17:15,900
know whether there's something there
 

4529
01:17:15,900 --> 01:17:18,350
know whether there's something there
that's good enough that means it's worth

4530
01:17:18,350 --> 01:17:18,360
that's good enough that means it's worth
 

4531
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:21,229
that's good enough that means it's worth
worth it to calculate here yes and and I

4532
01:17:21,229 --> 01:17:21,239
worth it to calculate here yes and and I
 

4533
01:17:21,239 --> 01:17:23,330
worth it to calculate here yes and and I
can follow that intuition probably to

4534
01:17:23,330 --> 01:17:23,340
can follow that intuition probably to
 

4535
01:17:23,340 --> 01:17:25,010
can follow that intuition probably to
because what what normally is going to

4536
01:17:25,010 --> 01:17:25,020
because what what normally is going to
 

4537
01:17:25,020 --> 01:17:27,110
because what what normally is going to
happen in such a situation is there

4538
01:17:27,110 --> 01:17:27,120
happen in such a situation is there
 

4539
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:28,669
happen in such a situation is there
probably are two moves or three moves

4540
01:17:28,669 --> 01:17:28,679
probably are two moves or three moves
 

4541
01:17:28,679 --> 01:17:30,590
probably are two moves or three moves
Max that you're gonna to consider in a

4542
01:17:30,590 --> 01:17:30,600
Max that you're gonna to consider in a
 

4543
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:31,910
Max that you're gonna to consider in a
really critical position like if I feel

4544
01:17:31,910 --> 01:17:31,920
really critical position like if I feel
 

4545
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:32,990
really critical position like if I feel
like there's something there there are

4546
01:17:32,990 --> 01:17:33,000
like there's something there there are
 

4547
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,490
like there's something there there are
two to three moves so if I know

4548
01:17:34,490 --> 01:17:34,500
two to three moves so if I know
 

4549
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:36,410
two to three moves so if I know
something is there I will I'll be able

4550
01:17:36,410 --> 01:17:36,420
something is there I will I'll be able
 

4551
01:17:36,420 --> 01:17:38,030
something is there I will I'll be able
to figure it out if I know that the

4552
01:17:38,030 --> 01:17:38,040
to figure it out if I know that the
 

4553
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:39,709
to figure it out if I know that the
position is very good

4554
01:17:39,709 --> 01:17:39,719
position is very good
 

4555
01:17:39,719 --> 01:17:42,590
position is very good
okay so one Buzz for a good position for

4556
01:17:42,590 --> 01:17:42,600
okay so one Buzz for a good position for
 

4557
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:44,209
okay so one Buzz for a good position for
the current position I just need to know

4558
01:17:44,209 --> 01:17:44,219
the current position I just need to know
 

4559
01:17:44,219 --> 01:17:46,130
the current position I just need to know
I just need to know whether whether like

4560
01:17:46,130 --> 01:17:46,140
I just need to know whether whether like
 

4561
01:17:46,140 --> 01:17:47,570
I just need to know whether whether like
there's a there's something really good

4562
01:17:47,570 --> 01:17:47,580
there's a there's something really good
 

4563
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:49,910
there's a there's something really good
the position is really good or it's it's

4564
01:17:49,910 --> 01:17:49,920
the position is really good or it's it's
 

4565
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:51,350
the position is really good or it's it's
just like an equal position or it's just

4566
01:17:51,350 --> 01:17:51,360
just like an equal position or it's just
 

4567
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:53,870
just like an equal position or it's just
normal current position not even future

4568
01:17:53,870 --> 01:17:53,880
normal current position not even future
 

4569
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:56,270
normal current position not even future
moves just the current position there is

4570
01:17:56,270 --> 01:17:56,280
moves just the current position there is
 

4571
01:17:56,280 --> 01:17:59,990
moves just the current position there is
a lot of Promise here yes okay uh what

4572
01:17:59,990 --> 01:18:00,000
a lot of Promise here yes okay uh what
 

4573
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,790
a lot of Promise here yes okay uh what
about the reverse like something's bad

4574
01:18:01,790 --> 01:18:01,800
about the reverse like something's bad
 

4575
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:03,530
about the reverse like something's bad
so you're saying if I'm if I'm in

4576
01:18:03,530 --> 01:18:03,540
so you're saying if I'm if I'm in
 

4577
01:18:03,540 --> 01:18:05,510
so you're saying if I'm if I'm in
trouble in a game yeah and I and I I'm

4578
01:18:05,510 --> 01:18:05,520
trouble in a game yeah and I and I I'm
 

4579
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:07,310
trouble in a game yeah and I and I I'm
in the same situation

4580
01:18:07,310 --> 01:18:07,320
in the same situation
 

4581
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:10,850
in the same situation
um so I'm in trouble in a game

4582
01:18:10,850 --> 01:18:10,860
um so I'm in trouble in a game
 

4583
01:18:10,860 --> 01:18:12,770
um so I'm in trouble in a game
it's it's probably a little bit more

4584
01:18:12,770 --> 01:18:12,780
it's it's probably a little bit more
 

4585
01:18:12,780 --> 01:18:14,630
it's it's probably a little bit more
it's probably like I would say three two

4586
01:18:14,630 --> 01:18:14,640
it's probably like I would say three two
 

4587
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:16,070
it's probably like I would say three two
to three times where I would need to

4588
01:18:16,070 --> 01:18:16,080
to three times where I would need to
 

4589
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:17,750
to three times where I would need to
know the source of the trouble yeah I

4590
01:18:17,750 --> 01:18:17,760
know the source of the trouble yeah I
 

4591
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:19,130
know the source of the trouble yeah I
would I would need to know yeah I need

4592
01:18:19,130 --> 01:18:19,140
would I would need to know yeah I need
 

4593
01:18:19,140 --> 01:18:20,570
would I would need to know yeah I need
to know like is there like one move

4594
01:18:20,570 --> 01:18:20,580
to know like is there like one move
 

4595
01:18:20,580 --> 01:18:21,890
to know like is there like one move
that's good or there's there's more than

4596
01:18:21,890 --> 01:18:21,900
that's good or there's there's more than
 

4597
01:18:21,900 --> 01:18:24,350
that's good or there's there's more than
one move again how you extrapolate that

4598
01:18:24,350 --> 01:18:24,360
one move again how you extrapolate that
 

4599
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:26,330
one move again how you extrapolate that
well wouldn't it be useful to know the

4600
01:18:26,330 --> 01:18:26,340
well wouldn't it be useful to know the
 

4601
01:18:26,340 --> 01:18:28,370
well wouldn't it be useful to know the
information that you're now in a

4602
01:18:28,370 --> 01:18:28,380
information that you're now in a
 

4603
01:18:28,380 --> 01:18:30,890
information that you're now in a
position where the other person could

4604
01:18:30,890 --> 01:18:30,900
position where the other person could
 

4605
01:18:30,900 --> 01:18:34,550
position where the other person could
create a lot of trouble for you so we'll

4606
01:18:34,550 --> 01:18:34,560
create a lot of trouble for you so we'll
 

4607
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:37,250
create a lot of trouble for you so we'll
find that like it's out there find it

4608
01:18:37,250 --> 01:18:37,260
find that like it's out there find it
 

4609
01:18:37,260 --> 01:18:38,870
find that like it's out there find it
like if you look at magnus's games there

4610
01:18:38,870 --> 01:18:38,880
like if you look at magnus's games there
 

4611
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:39,950
like if you look at magnus's games there
are a lot of situations where the

4612
01:18:39,950 --> 01:18:39,960
are a lot of situations where the
 

4613
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:42,169
are a lot of situations where the
position is equal but there's or it's

4614
01:18:42,169 --> 01:18:42,179
position is equal but there's or it's
 

4615
01:18:42,179 --> 01:18:44,510
position is equal but there's or it's
equals one move but only one move if you

4616
01:18:44,510 --> 01:18:44,520
equals one move but only one move if you
 

4617
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:45,530
equals one move but only one move if you
don't find that one move you're

4618
01:18:45,530 --> 01:18:45,540
don't find that one move you're
 

4619
01:18:45,540 --> 01:18:47,330
don't find that one move you're
significantly worse a lot of times

4620
01:18:47,330 --> 01:18:47,340
significantly worse a lot of times
 

4621
01:18:47,340 --> 01:18:49,850
significantly worse a lot of times
that's the case so like if I if I can

4622
01:18:49,850 --> 01:18:49,860
that's the case so like if I if I can
 

4623
01:18:49,860 --> 01:18:51,770
that's the case so like if I if I can
somehow note there's like only one move

4624
01:18:51,770 --> 01:18:51,780
somehow note there's like only one move
 

4625
01:18:51,780 --> 01:18:54,050
somehow note there's like only one move
where I'm okay I could figure it out

4626
01:18:54,050 --> 01:18:54,060
where I'm okay I could figure it out
 

4627
01:18:54,060 --> 01:18:58,490
where I'm okay I could figure it out
yeah yeah that's so that's one move is

4628
01:18:58,490 --> 01:18:58,500
yeah yeah that's so that's one move is
 

4629
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:00,709
yeah yeah that's so that's one move is
significantly better than the rest

4630
01:19:00,709 --> 01:19:00,719
significantly better than the rest
 

4631
01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:02,570
significantly better than the rest
I mean I could give you like a perfect

4632
01:19:02,570 --> 01:19:02,580
I mean I could give you like a perfect
 

4633
01:19:02,580 --> 01:19:04,490
I mean I could give you like a perfect
example as I played a game in the

4634
01:19:04,490 --> 01:19:04,500
example as I played a game in the
 

4635
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:06,169
example as I played a game in the
Canada's tournament last round against

4636
01:19:06,169 --> 01:19:06,179
Canada's tournament last round against
 

4637

Canada's tournament last round against
ding Loren from China and there there

4638
01:19:08,689 --> 01:19:08,699
ding Loren from China and there there
 

4639
01:19:08,699 --> 01:19:09,890
ding Loren from China and there there
were many times where it was completely

4640
01:19:09,890 --> 01:19:09,900
were many times where it was completely
 

4641
01:19:09,900 --> 01:19:11,810
were many times where it was completely
fine for me but it started drifting I

4642
01:19:11,810 --> 01:19:11,820
fine for me but it started drifting I
 

4643
01:19:11,820 --> 01:19:13,070
fine for me but it started drifting I
started making some mistakes and I was

4644
01:19:13,070 --> 01:19:13,080
started making some mistakes and I was
 

4645
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:14,689
started making some mistakes and I was
worse but there was one last moment

4646
01:19:14,689 --> 01:19:14,699
worse but there was one last moment
 

4647
01:19:14,699 --> 01:19:16,550
worse but there was one last moment
where I think I had one move where I

4648
01:19:16,550 --> 01:19:16,560
where I think I had one move where I
 

4649
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:17,689
where I think I had one move where I
would have been able to draw the game

4650
01:19:17,689 --> 01:19:17,699
would have been able to draw the game
 

4651
01:19:17,699 --> 01:19:19,850
would have been able to draw the game
quite easily and every other move I was

4652
01:19:19,850 --> 01:19:19,860
quite easily and every other move I was
 

4653
01:19:19,860 --> 01:19:21,169
quite easily and every other move I was
significantly worse and I did not find

4654
01:19:21,169 --> 01:19:21,179
significantly worse and I did not find
 

4655
01:19:21,179 --> 01:19:22,970
significantly worse and I did not find
that move and I lost the game but if I

4656
01:19:22,970 --> 01:19:22,980
that move and I lost the game but if I
 

4657
01:19:22,980 --> 01:19:24,229
that move and I lost the game but if I
had known it would have been nice to

4658

near the conversation I I actually on

4688
01:19:51,470 --> 01:19:51,480
near the conversation I I actually on
 

4689
01:19:51,480 --> 01:19:53,450
near the conversation I I actually on
that note I would say also I know people

4690
01:19:53,450 --> 01:19:53,460
that note I would say also I know people
 

4691
01:19:53,460 --> 01:19:55,790
that note I would say also I know people
wanted to know if I'm the greatest

4692
01:19:55,790 --> 01:19:55,800
wanted to know if I'm the greatest
 

4693
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:57,110
wanted to know if I'm the greatest
player to never have played for the

4694
01:19:57,110 --> 01:19:57,120
player to never have played for the
 

4695
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:58,490
player to never have played for the
world championship or to have not got

4696
01:19:58,490 --> 01:19:58,500
world championship or to have not got
 

4697
01:19:58,500 --> 01:20:00,350
world championship or to have not got
not become world champion I don't think

4698
01:20:00,350 --> 01:20:00,360
not become world champion I don't think
 

4699
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:01,850
not become world champion I don't think
that I'm actually anywhere near the top

4700
01:20:01,850 --> 01:20:01,860
that I'm actually anywhere near the top
 

4701
01:20:01,860 --> 01:20:03,709
that I'm actually anywhere near the top
of that conversation I actually think

4702
01:20:03,709 --> 01:20:03,719
of that conversation I actually think
 

4703
01:20:03,719 --> 01:20:06,290
of that conversation I actually think
Lavon aronian tops that conversation by

4704
01:20:06,290 --> 01:20:06,300
Lavon aronian tops that conversation by
 

4705
01:20:06,300 --> 01:20:08,149
Lavon aronian tops that conversation by
a big margin simply because he was

4706
01:20:08,149 --> 01:20:08,159
a big margin simply because he was
 

4707
01:20:08,159 --> 01:20:09,530
a big margin simply because he was
number two in the world for a very very

4708
01:20:09,530 --> 01:20:09,540
number two in the world for a very very
 

4709
01:20:09,540 --> 01:20:11,870
number two in the world for a very very
long time and he never even got to the

4710
01:20:11,870 --> 01:20:11,880
long time and he never even got to the
 

4711
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:14,450
long time and he never even got to the
match so as far as world champions and

4712
01:20:14,450 --> 01:20:14,460
match so as far as world champions and
 

4713
01:20:14,460 --> 01:20:16,430
match so as far as world champions and
who's the goat I think

4714
01:20:16,430 --> 01:20:16,440
who's the goat I think
 

4715
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:17,209
who's the goat I think
um

4716
01:20:17,209 --> 01:20:17,219
um
 

4717
01:20:17,219 --> 01:20:19,669
um
I think Magnus is the goat simply

4718
01:20:19,669 --> 01:20:19,679
I think Magnus is the goat simply
 

4719
01:20:19,679 --> 01:20:22,010
I think Magnus is the goat simply
because he's playing the best chess

4720
01:20:22,010 --> 01:20:22,020
because he's playing the best chess
 

4721
01:20:22,020 --> 01:20:24,709
because he's playing the best chess
by by a bigger margin he has the highest

4722
01:20:24,709 --> 01:20:24,719
by by a bigger margin he has the highest
 

4723
01:20:24,719 --> 01:20:27,189
by by a bigger margin he has the highest
ELO of all time uh on the other hand

4724
01:20:27,189 --> 01:20:27,199
ELO of all time uh on the other hand
 

4725
01:20:27,199 --> 01:20:29,450
ELO of all time uh on the other hand
chess is a game where you know you build

4726
01:20:29,450 --> 01:20:29,460
chess is a game where you know you build
 

4727
01:20:29,460 --> 01:20:31,550
chess is a game where you know you build
upon you build upon the Giants of the

4728
01:20:31,550 --> 01:20:31,560
upon you build upon the Giants of the
 

4729
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:34,729
upon you build upon the Giants of the
past we learn we learn from them and so

4730
01:20:34,729 --> 01:20:34,739
past we learn we learn from them and so
 

4731
01:20:34,739 --> 01:20:36,169
past we learn we learn from them and so
you can definitely make the case for

4732
01:20:36,169 --> 01:20:36,179
you can definitely make the case for
 

4733
01:20:36,179 --> 01:20:37,610
you can definitely make the case for
Gary as well I mean he's the number one

4734
01:20:37,610 --> 01:20:37,620
Gary as well I mean he's the number one
 

4735
01:20:37,620 --> 01:20:39,709
Gary as well I mean he's the number one
player in the world for 20 plus years a

4736
01:20:39,709 --> 01:20:39,719
player in the world for 20 plus years a
 

4737
01:20:39,719 --> 01:20:41,990
player in the world for 20 plus years a
lot of opening strategies he came up

4738
01:20:41,990 --> 01:20:42,000
lot of opening strategies he came up
 

4739
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,350
lot of opening strategies he came up
with in our people still play them today

4740
01:20:44,350 --> 01:20:44,360
with in our people still play them today
 

4741
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:46,970
with in our people still play them today
Bobby I'm not so sure you can really

4742
01:20:46,970 --> 01:20:46,980
Bobby I'm not so sure you can really
 

4743
01:20:46,980 --> 01:20:49,010
Bobby I'm not so sure you can really
make that case because he was he shot up

4744
01:20:49,010 --> 01:20:49,020
make that case because he was he shot up
 

4745
01:20:49,020 --> 01:20:50,450
make that case because he was he shot up
really quickly but he was the world

4746
01:20:50,450 --> 01:20:50,460
really quickly but he was the world
 

4747
01:20:50,460 --> 01:20:52,370
really quickly but he was the world
champion for a very short window of time

4748
01:20:52,370 --> 01:20:52,380
champion for a very short window of time
 

4749
01:20:52,380 --> 01:20:54,530
champion for a very short window of time
and then he quit the game as soon as he

4750
01:20:54,530 --> 01:20:54,540
and then he quit the game as soon as he
 

4751
01:20:54,540 --> 01:20:56,270
and then he quit the game as soon as he
became world champion so I don't really

4752
01:20:56,270 --> 01:20:56,280
became world champion so I don't really
 

4753
01:20:56,280 --> 01:20:58,729
became world champion so I don't really
feel like you can put Fisher in that uh

4754
01:20:58,729 --> 01:20:58,739
feel like you can put Fisher in that uh
 

4755
01:20:58,739 --> 01:21:01,490
feel like you can put Fisher in that uh
in that conversation simply because he

4756
01:21:01,490 --> 01:21:01,500
in that conversation simply because he
 

4757
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:03,530
in that conversation simply because he
didn't have that longevity at all he was

4758
01:21:03,530 --> 01:21:03,540
didn't have that longevity at all he was
 

4759
01:21:03,540 --> 01:21:05,330
didn't have that longevity at all he was
he was up there for a couple of years so

4760
01:21:05,330 --> 01:21:05,340
he was up there for a couple of years so
 

4761
01:21:05,340 --> 01:21:07,610
he was up there for a couple of years so
I would say it's probably Magnus but I

4762
01:21:07,610 --> 01:21:07,620
I would say it's probably Magnus but I
 

4763
01:21:07,620 --> 01:21:09,590
I would say it's probably Magnus but I
understand people can also say Gary's

4764
01:21:09,590 --> 01:21:09,600
understand people can also say Gary's
 

4765
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:11,570
understand people can also say Gary's
Gary's the best player ever

4766
01:21:11,570 --> 01:21:11,580
Gary's the best player ever
 

4767
01:21:11,580 --> 01:21:12,830
Gary's the best player ever
um remains to be seen but I think if

4768
01:21:12,830 --> 01:21:12,840
um remains to be seen but I think if
 

4769
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:14,030
um remains to be seen but I think if
Magnus is number one for probably

4770
01:21:14,030 --> 01:21:14,040
Magnus is number one for probably
 

4771
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:15,890
Magnus is number one for probably
another let's say another three to four

4772
01:21:15,890 --> 01:21:15,900
another let's say another three to four
 

4773
01:21:15,900 --> 01:21:17,510
another let's say another three to four
years I don't think there's any debate

4774
01:21:17,510 --> 01:21:17,520
years I don't think there's any debate
 

4775
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:18,950
years I don't think there's any debate
at all

4776
01:21:18,950 --> 01:21:18,960
at all
 

4777
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:21,709
at all
can you break down what makes him so

4778
01:21:21,709 --> 01:21:21,719
can you break down what makes him so
 

4779
01:21:21,719 --> 01:21:22,490
can you break down what makes him so
good

4780
01:21:22,490 --> 01:21:22,500
good
 

4781
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:23,930
good
we've already talked about different

4782
01:21:23,930 --> 01:21:23,940
we've already talked about different
 

4783
01:21:23,940 --> 01:21:26,590
we've already talked about different
angles of this and I would also

4784
01:21:26,590 --> 01:21:26,600
angles of this and I would also
 

4785
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:29,390
angles of this and I would also

he he just you know that in the end game

4798
01:21:43,669 --> 01:21:43,679
he he just you know that in the end game
 

4799
01:21:43,679 --> 01:21:45,709

in the end games if you get there he's
just he's not gonna blunder that's the

4802

first thing so you know if you reach an
end game he's not going to make a

4806
01:21:50,030 --> 01:21:50,040
end game he's not going to make a
 

4807
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:51,830
end game he's not going to make a
mistake he obviously plays great

4808
01:21:51,830 --> 01:21:51,840
mistake he obviously plays great
 

4809
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:54,890
mistake he obviously plays great
openings and there's just really no

4810
01:21:54,890 --> 01:21:54,900
openings and there's just really no
 

4811
01:21:54,900 --> 01:21:57,229
openings and there's just really no
defined weakness that he has there's no

4812
01:21:57,229 --> 01:21:57,239
defined weakness that he has there's no
 

4813
01:21:57,239 --> 01:21:59,270
defined weakness that he has there's no
weakness that I can think of very

4814
01:21:59,270 --> 01:21:59,280
weakness that I can think of very
 

4815
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:00,470
weakness that I can think of very
specifically

4816
01:22:00,470 --> 01:22:00,480
specifically
 

4817
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:01,550
specifically
um many there are many times where

4818
01:22:01,550 --> 01:22:01,560
um many there are many times where
 

4819
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:02,930
um many there are many times where
players that actually out prepare him in

4820
01:22:02,930 --> 01:22:02,940
players that actually out prepare him in
 

4821
01:22:02,940 --> 01:22:04,610
players that actually out prepare him in
the opening phase but as soon as they're

4822
01:22:04,610 --> 01:22:04,620
the opening phase but as soon as they're
 

4823
01:22:04,620 --> 01:22:06,290
the opening phase but as soon as they're
on their own and they have to think very

4824
01:22:06,290 --> 01:22:06,300
on their own and they have to think very
 

4825
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:08,270
on their own and they have to think very
often times they'll make mistakes

4826
01:22:08,270 --> 01:22:08,280
often times they'll make mistakes
 

4827
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:10,610
often times they'll make mistakes
um so there's just no weakness for

4828
01:22:10,610 --> 01:22:10,620
um so there's just no weakness for
 

4829
01:22:10,620 --> 01:22:12,649
um so there's just no weakness for
Magnus really no weakness well unlike

4830
01:22:12,649 --> 01:22:12,659
Magnus really no weakness well unlike
 

4831
01:22:12,659 --> 01:22:14,209
Magnus really no weakness well unlike
say Casper like kasparab on the other

say Casper like kasparab on the other
 

4833
01:22:14,219 --> 01:22:15,770
say Casper like kasparab on the other
hand there there are very clear

4834
01:22:15,770 --> 01:22:15,780
hand there there are very clear
 

4835
01:22:15,780 --> 01:22:17,270
hand there there are very clear
weaknesses

4836
01:22:17,270 --> 01:22:17,280
weaknesses
 

4837
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:19,070
weaknesses
um in his game like kramnik exploit them

4838
01:22:19,070 --> 01:22:19,080
um in his game like kramnik exploit them
 

4839
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:21,290
um in his game like kramnik exploit them
first of all very I don't want to say

4840
01:22:21,290 --> 01:22:21,300
first of all very I don't want to say
 

4841
01:22:21,300 --> 01:22:24,050
first of all very I don't want to say
like ego is the right word but like very

like ego is the right word but like very
 

4843
01:22:24,060 --> 01:22:25,790
like ego is the right word but like very
stubborn believing that his openings

4844
01:22:25,790 --> 01:22:25,800
stubborn believing that his openings
 

4845
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:27,470
stubborn believing that his openings
were infallible that he could just win

4846
01:22:27,470 --> 01:22:27,480
were infallible that he could just win
 

4847
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:29,450
were infallible that he could just win
he could just prove an advantage and win

4848
01:22:29,450 --> 01:22:29,460
he could just prove an advantage and win
 

4849
01:22:29,460 --> 01:22:31,130
he could just prove an advantage and win
the game out of the opening like against

4850
01:22:31,130 --> 01:22:31,140
the game out of the opening like against
 

4851
01:22:31,140 --> 01:22:33,410
the game out of the opening like against
kramnik when he ultimately lost also

4852
01:22:33,410 --> 01:22:33,420
kramnik when he ultimately lost also
 

4853
01:22:33,420 --> 01:22:35,810
kramnik when he ultimately lost also
generally not a great defender either

4854
01:22:35,810 --> 01:22:35,820
generally not a great defender either
 

4855
01:22:35,820 --> 01:22:38,209
generally not a great defender either
very strong tactically but if he was in

4856
01:22:38,209 --> 01:22:38,219
very strong tactically but if he was in
 

4857
01:22:38,219 --> 01:22:39,530
very strong tactically but if he was in
positions that were defensive he would

4858
01:22:39,530 --> 01:22:39,540
positions that were defensive he would
 

4859
01:22:39,540 --> 01:22:41,149
positions that were defensive he would
make mistakes and lose in end games like

4860
01:22:41,149 --> 01:22:41,159
make mistakes and lose in end games like
 

4861
01:22:41,159 --> 01:22:43,130
make mistakes and lose in end games like
he did in one of those games in the

4862
01:22:43,130 --> 01:22:43,140
he did in one of those games in the
 

4863
01:22:43,140 --> 01:22:44,870
he did in one of those games in the
world championship against kramnik so

4864
01:22:44,870 --> 01:22:44,880
world championship against kramnik so
 

4865
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:46,850
world championship against kramnik so
there were very clear defined weaknesses

4866
01:22:46,850 --> 01:22:46,860
there were very clear defined weaknesses
 

4867
01:22:46,860 --> 01:22:48,649
there were very clear defined weaknesses
in Sparrow's game

4868
01:22:48,649 --> 01:22:48,659
in Sparrow's game
 

4869
01:22:48,659 --> 01:22:50,330
in Sparrow's game
um whereas like magnets are just they're

4870
01:22:50,330 --> 01:22:50,340
um whereas like magnets are just they're
 

4871
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:52,490
um whereas like magnets are just they're
no clearly defined weaknesses maybe

4872
01:22:52,490 --> 01:22:52,500
no clearly defined weaknesses maybe
 

4873
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:54,169
no clearly defined weaknesses maybe
maybe he doesn't like being attacked

4874
01:22:54,169 --> 01:22:54,179
maybe he doesn't like being attacked
 

4875
01:22:54,179 --> 01:22:56,390
maybe he doesn't like being attacked
maybe that's the one thing he likes King

4876
01:22:56,390 --> 01:22:56,400
maybe that's the one thing he likes King
 

4877
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:57,470
maybe that's the one thing he likes King
safety and he doesn't like being

4878
01:22:57,470 --> 01:22:57,480
safety and he doesn't like being
 

4879
01:22:57,480 --> 01:22:59,090
safety and he doesn't like being
attacked but that's not something that

4880
01:22:59,090 --> 01:22:59,100
attacked but that's not something that
 

4881
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:01,490
attacked but that's not something that
you can easily do whereas say uh if

4882
01:23:01,490 --> 01:23:01,500
you can easily do whereas say uh if
 

4883
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:02,870
you can easily do whereas say uh if
someone's very tactical and they're not

4884
01:23:02,870 --> 01:23:02,880
someone's very tactical and they're not
 

4885
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:04,490
someone's very tactical and they're not
a strong positionally that is something

4886
01:23:04,490 --> 01:23:04,500
a strong positionally that is something
 

4887
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:06,530
a strong positionally that is something
you can def that will happen quite

4888
01:23:06,530 --> 01:23:06,540
you can def that will happen quite
 

4889
01:23:06,540 --> 01:23:07,970
you can def that will happen quite
frequently in games you can steer games

4890
01:23:07,970 --> 01:23:07,980
frequently in games you can steer games
 

4891
01:23:07,980 --> 01:23:09,649
frequently in games you can steer games
a certain way doesn't mean you'll always

4892
01:23:09,649 --> 01:23:09,659
a certain way doesn't mean you'll always
 

4893
01:23:09,659 --> 01:23:11,930
a certain way doesn't mean you'll always
get there but that is something tangible

4894
01:23:11,930 --> 01:23:11,940
get there but that is something tangible
 

4895
01:23:11,940 --> 01:23:13,910
get there but that is something tangible
whereas King safety that's not something

4896
01:23:13,910 --> 01:23:13,920
whereas King safety that's not something
 

4897
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:16,430
whereas King safety that's not something
tangible at all it's very very hard to

4898
01:23:16,430 --> 01:23:16,440
tangible at all it's very very hard to
 

4899
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:18,830
tangible at all it's very very hard to
attack someone uh based on unless they

4900
01:23:18,830 --> 01:23:18,840
attack someone uh based on unless they
 

4901
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:21,110

01:23:32,450 --> 01:23:32,460
kremnick that was so challenging I mean
 

4911
01:23:32,460 --> 01:23:33,950

I think this is kramnik understood him

4912
01:23:33,950 --> 01:23:33,960
I think this is kramnik understood him
 

4913
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:35,689
I think this is kramnik understood him
actually one thing that's funny speaking

4914
01:23:35,689 --> 01:23:35,699
actually one thing that's funny speaking
 

4915
01:23:35,699 --> 01:23:37,850
actually one thing that's funny speaking
of Kasparov is that I think it got under

4916
01:23:37,850 --> 01:23:37,860
of Kasparov is that I think it got under
 

4917
01:23:37,860 --> 01:23:39,290
of Kasparov is that I think it got under
her skin like when I worked with him

4918
01:23:39,290 --> 01:23:39,300
her skin like when I worked with him
 

4919
01:23:39,300 --> 01:23:41,630
her skin like when I worked with him
kramnik actually played a certain style

kramnik actually played a certain style
 

4921
01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:44,209
kramnik actually played a certain style
very like very aggressive very sort of

4922
01:23:44,209 --> 01:23:44,219
very like very aggressive very sort of
 

4923
01:23:44,219 --> 01:23:46,430
very like very aggressive very sort of
risky opening play during the time when

4924
01:23:46,430 --> 01:23:46,440
risky opening play during the time when
 

4925
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:48,290
risky opening play during the time when
I was when I was working with Gary and I

4926
01:23:48,290 --> 01:23:48,300
I was when I was working with Gary and I
 

4927
01:23:48,300 --> 01:23:49,550
I was when I was working with Gary and I
know that he annoyed Gary because he's

4928
01:23:49,550 --> 01:23:49,560
know that he annoyed Gary because he's
 

4929
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:50,990
know that he annoyed Gary because he's
like why couldn't kramnik play like this

4930
01:23:50,990 --> 01:23:51,000
like why couldn't kramnik play like this
 

4931
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,910
like why couldn't kramnik play like this
against me because I think Gary Felton

4932
01:23:52,910 --> 01:23:52,920
against me because I think Gary Felton
 

4933
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:54,470
against me because I think Gary Felton
did that against him he would have just

4934
01:23:54,470 --> 01:23:54,480
did that against him he would have just
 

4935
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:56,570
did that against him he would have just
blown him off the board and had had many

4936
01:23:56,570 --> 01:23:56,580
blown him off the board and had had many
 

4937
01:23:56,580 --> 01:23:59,870
blown him off the board and had had many
great victories so I think it's cramic

4938
01:23:59,870 --> 01:23:59,880
great victories so I think it's cramic
 

4939
01:23:59,880 --> 01:24:01,490
great victories so I think it's cramic
understood Gary they had worked together

4940

understood Gary they had worked together
 

4941
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:03,649
understood Gary they had worked together
I think during during the late 90s I

4942
01:24:03,649 --> 01:24:03,659
I think during during the late 90s I
 

4943
01:24:03,659 --> 01:24:06,290
I think during during the late 90s I
think Gary actually was very useful or

4944
01:24:06,290 --> 01:24:06,300
think Gary actually was very useful or
 

4945
01:24:06,300 --> 01:24:07,669
think Gary actually was very useful or
very helpful in terms of cram of getting

4946
01:24:07,669 --> 01:24:07,679
very helpful in terms of cram of getting
 

4947
01:24:07,679 --> 01:24:10,250
very helpful in terms of cram of getting
a spot on one of the uh Russian chess

4948
01:24:10,250 --> 01:24:10,260
a spot on one of the uh Russian chess
 

4949
01:24:10,260 --> 01:24:13,130
a spot on one of the uh Russian chess
Olympiad teams in in the mid 90s so I

4950
01:24:13,130 --> 01:24:13,140
Olympiad teams in in the mid 90s so I
 

4951
01:24:13,140 --> 01:24:14,390
Olympiad teams in in the mid 90s so I
think it's just kramnik understood him

4952
01:24:14,390 --> 01:24:14,400
think it's just kramnik understood him
 

4953
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:17,149
think it's just kramnik understood him
very well and Gary just could not he

4954
01:24:17,149 --> 01:24:17,159
very well and Gary just could not he
 

4955
01:24:17,159 --> 01:24:18,709
very well and Gary just could not he
just he couldn't figure it out I think

4956
01:24:18,709 --> 01:24:18,719
just he couldn't figure it out I think
 

4957
01:24:18,719 --> 01:24:20,810
just he couldn't figure it out I think
also another things coming back to

4958
01:24:20,810 --> 01:24:20,820
also another things coming back to
 

4959
01:24:20,820 --> 01:24:22,910
also another things coming back to
Psycho psychological part is that

4960
01:24:22,910 --> 01:24:22,920
Psycho psychological part is that
 

4961
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:24,709
Psycho psychological part is that
kramnik actually beat Kasparov in many

4962
01:24:24,709 --> 01:24:24,719
kramnik actually beat Kasparov in many
 

4963
01:24:24,719 --> 01:24:26,149
kramnik actually beat Kasparov in many
games in the king's Indian defense

4964
01:24:26,149 --> 01:24:26,159
games in the king's Indian defense
 

4965
01:24:26,159 --> 01:24:27,830
games in the king's Indian defense
Kasparov played the king's Indian

4966
01:24:27,830 --> 01:24:27,840
Kasparov played the king's Indian
 

4967
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:29,450
Kasparov played the king's Indian
defense for many years and they started

4968
01:24:29,450 --> 01:24:29,460
defense for many years and they started
 

4969
01:24:29,460 --> 01:24:30,950
defense for many years and they started
losing like four or five games in a row

4970
01:24:30,950 --> 01:24:30,960
losing like four or five games in a row
 

4971
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:32,870
losing like four or five games in a row
in it to kramnik very similar to what I

4972
01:24:32,870 --> 01:24:32,880
in it to kramnik very similar to what I
 

4973
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:34,370
in it to kramnik very similar to what I
mentioned about the silly night orphan

4974
01:24:34,370 --> 01:24:34,380
mentioned about the silly night orphan
 

4975
01:24:34,380 --> 01:24:36,530
mentioned about the silly night orphan
Fabiano and Gary gave it up he started

4976
01:24:36,530 --> 01:24:36,540
Fabiano and Gary gave it up he started
 

4977
01:24:36,540 --> 01:24:37,850
Fabiano and Gary gave it up he started
switching to playing the grunfeld

4978
01:24:37,850 --> 01:24:37,860
switching to playing the grunfeld
 

4979
01:24:37,860 --> 01:24:39,410
switching to playing the grunfeld
defense and so I think that also

4980
01:24:39,410 --> 01:24:39,420
defense and so I think that also
 

4981
01:24:39,420 --> 01:24:41,630
defense and so I think that also
instilled some psychological fear as

4982
01:24:41,630 --> 01:24:41,640
instilled some psychological fear as
 

4983
01:24:41,640 --> 01:24:43,610
instilled some psychological fear as
well because Gary was he was the boss in

4984
01:24:43,610 --> 01:24:43,620
well because Gary was he was the boss in
 

4985
01:24:43,620 --> 01:24:46,970
well because Gary was he was the boss in
openings no one could compare to him

4986
01:24:46,970 --> 01:24:46,980
openings no one could compare to him
 

4987
01:24:46,980 --> 01:24:50,750
openings no one could compare to him
what makes you so good what uh what

What's the breakdown of the strengths

4990
01:24:52,910 --> 01:24:52,920
What's the breakdown of the strengths
 

4991
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:56,050
What's the breakdown of the strengths
and weaknesses

4992
01:24:56,050 --> 01:24:56,060

 

4993
01:24:56,060 --> 01:24:59,090

so that's I think probably my biggest

4994
01:24:59,090 --> 01:24:59,100
so that's I think probably my biggest
 

4995
01:24:59,100 --> 01:25:01,070
so that's I think probably my biggest
strength is that I'm a universal player

4996
01:25:01,070 --> 01:25:01,080
strength is that I'm a universal player
 

4997
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:03,229
strength is that I'm a universal player
I can play pretty much any opening

4998
01:25:03,229 --> 01:25:03,239
I can play pretty much any opening
 

4999
01:25:03,239 --> 01:25:05,990
I can play pretty much any opening
strategy doesn't doesn't really matter

5000
01:25:05,990 --> 01:25:06,000
strategy doesn't doesn't really matter
 

5001
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:09,290
strategy doesn't doesn't really matter
um beyond that I think it's mainly that

5002
01:25:09,290 --> 01:25:09,300
um beyond that I think it's mainly that
 

5003
01:25:09,300 --> 01:25:11,810
um beyond that I think it's mainly that
I don't really make many blunders I

5004
01:25:11,810 --> 01:25:11,820
I don't really make many blunders I
 

5005
01:25:11,820 --> 01:25:13,250
I don't really make many blunders I
don't make blunders unless I'm under a

5006
01:25:13,250 --> 01:25:13,260
don't make blunders unless I'm under a
 

5007
01:25:13,260 --> 01:25:16,310
don't make blunders unless I'm under a
lot of pressure generally so that I mean

5008
01:25:16,310 --> 01:25:16,320
lot of pressure generally so that I mean
 

5009
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:18,350
lot of pressure generally so that I mean
I know I'm I'm oversimplifying it's not

5010
01:25:18,350 --> 01:25:18,360
I know I'm I'm oversimplifying it's not
 

5011
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:21,470
I know I'm I'm oversimplifying it's not
as as simple as does this apply to uh to

5012
01:25:21,470 --> 01:25:21,480
as as simple as does this apply to uh to
 

5013
01:25:21,480 --> 01:25:23,390
as as simple as does this apply to uh to
Blitz as well I think it's much more

5014
01:25:23,390 --> 01:25:23,400
Blitz as well I think it's much more
 

5015
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:25,250
Blitz as well I think it's much more
applicable to Blitz in particular

5016
01:25:25,250 --> 01:25:25,260
applicable to Blitz in particular
 

5017
01:25:25,260 --> 01:25:27,169
applicable to Blitz in particular
because my intuition is very good so

5018
01:25:27,169 --> 01:25:27,179
because my intuition is very good so
 

5019
01:25:27,179 --> 01:25:28,610
because my intuition is very good so
when I'm making less blunders with

5020
01:25:28,610 --> 01:25:28,620
when I'm making less blunders with
 

5021
01:25:28,620 --> 01:25:30,590
when I'm making less blunders with
limited time on the clock my opponents

5022
01:25:30,590 --> 01:25:30,600
limited time on the clock my opponents
 

5023
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:32,030
limited time on the clock my opponents
actually make a lot more blunders that

5024
01:25:32,030 --> 01:25:32,040
actually make a lot more blunders that
 

5025
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:33,410
actually make a lot more blunders that
that's why I think it's much more

5026
01:25:33,410 --> 01:25:33,420
that's why I think it's much more
 

5027
01:25:33,420 --> 01:25:35,450
that's why I think it's much more
pronounced in Blitz than it is in

5028
01:25:35,450 --> 01:25:35,460
pronounced in Blitz than it is in
 

5029
01:25:35,460 --> 01:25:37,610
pronounced in Blitz than it is in
classical chess because in Blitz when

5030
01:25:37,610 --> 01:25:37,620
classical chess because in Blitz when
 

5031
01:25:37,620 --> 01:25:39,830
classical chess because in Blitz when
you're down to like 10 seconds uh in the

5032
01:25:39,830 --> 01:25:39,840
you're down to like 10 seconds uh in the
 

5033
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:41,689
you're down to like 10 seconds uh in the
game both players have 10 seconds my

5034
01:25:41,689 --> 01:25:41,699
game both players have 10 seconds my
 

5035
01:25:41,699 --> 01:25:43,610
game both players have 10 seconds my
intuition is just better than theirs I

5036
01:25:43,610 --> 01:25:43,620
intuition is just better than theirs I
 

5037
01:25:43,620 --> 01:25:45,290
intuition is just better than theirs I
mean Magnus maybe not so clear but like

5038
01:25:45,290 --> 01:25:45,300
mean Magnus maybe not so clear but like
 

5039
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:47,090
mean Magnus maybe not so clear but like
if you look at other players say Fabiana

5040
01:25:47,090 --> 01:25:47,100
if you look at other players say Fabiana
 

5041
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:48,890
if you look at other players say Fabiana
car one a very strong player when he

5042
01:25:48,890 --> 01:25:48,900
car one a very strong player when he
 

5043
01:25:48,900 --> 01:25:50,630
car one a very strong player when he
gets down to 10 seconds or in these

5044
01:25:50,630 --> 01:25:50,640
gets down to 10 seconds or in these
 

5045
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:53,149
gets down to 10 seconds or in these
these uh these situations he almost

5046
01:25:53,149 --> 01:25:53,159
these uh these situations he almost
 

5047
01:25:53,159 --> 01:25:55,490
these uh these situations he almost
always makes a blunder almost always um

5048
01:25:55,490 --> 01:25:55,500
always makes a blunder almost always um
 

5049
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:56,990
always makes a blunder almost always um
so I'm just more precise I make less

5050
01:25:56,990 --> 01:25:57,000
so I'm just more precise I make less
 

5051
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,930
so I'm just more precise I make less
blunders and that that's really the the

5052
01:25:59,930 --> 01:25:59,940
blunders and that that's really the the
 

5053
01:25:59,940 --> 01:26:02,030
blunders and that that's really the the
effect is much more dramatic Blitz what

5054
01:26:02,030 --> 01:26:02,040
effect is much more dramatic Blitz what
 

5055
01:26:02,040 --> 01:26:04,729
effect is much more dramatic Blitz what
do you think that intuition is like uh

5056
01:26:04,729 --> 01:26:04,739
do you think that intuition is like uh
 

5057
01:26:04,739 --> 01:26:07,450
do you think that intuition is like uh
sorry for the kind of

5058
01:26:07,450 --> 01:26:07,460
sorry for the kind of
 

5059
01:26:07,460 --> 01:26:10,270
sorry for the kind of
uh like almost philosophical question

5060
01:26:10,270 --> 01:26:10,280
uh like almost philosophical question
 

5061
01:26:10,280 --> 01:26:14,030
uh like almost philosophical question
what what is that is that calculation

5062
01:26:14,030 --> 01:26:14,040
what what is that is that calculation
 

5063
01:26:14,040 --> 01:26:16,490
what what is that is that calculation
or is it some kind of weird memory

5064
01:26:16,490 --> 01:26:16,500
or is it some kind of weird memory
 

5065
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:18,830
or is it some kind of weird memory
recall what is that like being able to

5066
01:26:18,830 --> 01:26:18,840
recall what is that like being able to
 

5067
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:20,810
recall what is that like being able to
do that Short Line

5068
01:26:20,810 --> 01:26:20,820
do that Short Line
 

5069
01:26:20,820 --> 01:26:22,729
do that Short Line
prediction I think that's just playing

5070
01:26:22,729 --> 01:26:22,739
prediction I think that's just playing
 

5071
01:26:22,739 --> 01:26:25,129
prediction I think that's just playing
so many games online and there's some

5072
01:26:25,129 --> 01:26:25,139
so many games online and there's some
 

5073
01:26:25,139 --> 01:26:27,649
so many games online and there's some
kind of subconscious field that I have

5074
01:26:27,649 --> 01:26:27,659
kind of subconscious field that I have
 

5075
01:26:27,659 --> 01:26:29,450
kind of subconscious field that I have
because when you're that low on time you

5076
01:26:29,450 --> 01:26:29,460
because when you're that low on time you
 

5077
01:26:29,460 --> 01:26:30,830
because when you're that low on time you
can't calculate it's just you have to

5078
01:26:30,830 --> 01:26:30,840
can't calculate it's just you have to
 

5079
01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:32,030
can't calculate it's just you have to
look you just have to figure out what's

5080
01:26:32,030 --> 01:26:32,040
look you just have to figure out what's
 

5081
01:26:32,040 --> 01:26:33,470
look you just have to figure out what's
the move you want to play is no

5082
01:26:33,470 --> 01:26:33,480
the move you want to play is no
 

5083
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:35,750
the move you want to play is no
calculation and just go with it and I

5084
01:26:35,750 --> 01:26:35,760
calculation and just go with it and I
 

5085
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:37,250
calculation and just go with it and I
think just playing so many games

5086
01:26:37,250 --> 01:26:37,260
think just playing so many games
 

5087
01:26:37,260 --> 01:26:39,050
think just playing so many games
probably I mean I'm guessing I've played

5088
01:26:39,050 --> 01:26:39,060
probably I mean I'm guessing I've played
 

5089
01:26:39,060 --> 01:26:41,990
probably I mean I'm guessing I've played
over 300 000 games online and I think

5090
01:26:41,990 --> 01:26:42,000
over 300 000 games online and I think
 

5091
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,850
over 300 000 games online and I think
just playing all those games it's it's a

5092
01:26:43,850 --> 01:26:43,860
just playing all those games it's it's a
 

5093
01:26:43,860 --> 01:26:47,390
just playing all those games it's it's a
feel there's there's no tangible way uh

5094
01:26:47,390 --> 01:26:47,400
feel there's there's no tangible way uh
 

5095
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:48,770
feel there's there's no tangible way uh
that I can't put that really into words

5096
01:26:48,770 --> 01:26:48,780
that I can't put that really into words
 

5097
01:26:48,780 --> 01:26:50,990
that I can't put that really into words
it's just a feel what do you Visual and

5098
01:26:50,990 --> 01:26:51,000
it's just a feel what do you Visual and
 

5099
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,910
it's just a feel what do you Visual and
we should say that you're I think

5100
01:26:52,910 --> 01:26:52,920
we should say that you're I think
 

5101
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:54,590
we should say that you're I think
currently the number one ranked Blitz

5102
01:26:54,590 --> 01:26:54,600
currently the number one ranked Blitz
 

5103
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:58,669
currently the number one ranked Blitz
player in the world you have uh been for

5104
01:26:58,669 --> 01:26:58,679
player in the world you have uh been for
 

5105
01:26:58,679 --> 01:27:01,010
player in the world you have uh been for
a while you're unquestionably one of the

5106
01:27:01,010 --> 01:27:01,020
a while you're unquestionably one of the
 

5107
01:27:01,020 --> 01:27:04,250
a while you're unquestionably one of the
greatest so the classical rapid and

5108
01:27:04,250 --> 01:27:04,260
greatest so the classical rapid and
 

5109
01:27:04,260 --> 01:27:05,990
greatest so the classical rapid and
Blitz you're one of the best people for

5110
01:27:05,990 --> 01:27:06,000
Blitz you're one of the best people for
 

5111
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,090
Blitz you're one of the best people for
many years in the world okay but you're

5112
01:27:08,090 --> 01:27:08,100
many years in the world okay but you're
 

5113
01:27:08,100 --> 01:27:10,729
many years in the world okay but you're
currently number one Blitz

5114
01:27:10,729 --> 01:27:10,739
currently number one Blitz
 

5115
01:27:10,739 --> 01:27:11,450
currently number one Blitz
um

5116
01:27:11,450 --> 01:27:11,460
um
 

5117
01:27:11,460 --> 01:27:14,570
um
so I I'd love to kind of for you to dig

5118
01:27:14,570 --> 01:27:14,580
so I I'd love to kind of for you to dig
 

5119
01:27:14,580 --> 01:27:17,750
so I I'd love to kind of for you to dig
into the secret to your success in Blitz

5120
01:27:17,750 --> 01:27:17,760
into the secret to your success in Blitz
 

5121
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:21,050
into the secret to your success in Blitz
is it as you're saying that intuition

5122
01:27:21,050 --> 01:27:21,060
is it as you're saying that intuition
 

5123
01:27:21,060 --> 01:27:23,930
is it as you're saying that intuition
being able to when the time is short

5124
01:27:23,930 --> 01:27:23,940
being able to when the time is short
 

5125
01:27:23,940 --> 01:27:26,330
being able to when the time is short
to not make blunders and then to make a

5126
01:27:26,330 --> 01:27:26,340
to not make blunders and then to make a
 

5127
01:27:26,340 --> 01:27:28,250
to not make blunders and then to make a
close to Optimal move I think it's

5128
01:27:28,250 --> 01:27:28,260
close to Optimal move I think it's
 

5129
01:27:28,260 --> 01:27:29,990
close to Optimal move I think it's
generally that

5130
01:27:29,990 --> 01:27:30,000
generally that
 

5131
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,390
generally that
I'm able to keep the games going no

5132
01:27:32,390 --> 01:27:32,400
I'm able to keep the games going no
 

5133
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:34,669
I'm able to keep the games going no
matter what until we're low on time I'm

5134
01:27:34,669 --> 01:27:34,679
matter what until we're low on time I'm
 

5135
01:27:34,679 --> 01:27:36,830
matter what until we're low on time I'm
always able to do that yeah like if we

5136
01:27:36,830 --> 01:27:36,840
always able to do that yeah like if we
 

5137
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:37,970
always able to do that yeah like if we
play a game with three minutes like

5138
01:27:37,970 --> 01:27:37,980
play a game with three minutes like
 

5139
01:27:37,980 --> 01:27:40,010
play a game with three minutes like
there are games I will just win win very

5140
01:27:40,010 --> 01:27:40,020
there are games I will just win win very
 

5141
01:27:40,020 --> 01:27:42,590
there are games I will just win win very
quickly but a lot of games between top

5142
01:27:42,590 --> 01:27:42,600
quickly but a lot of games between top
 

5143
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:44,209
quickly but a lot of games between top
players players have to think you have

5144
01:27:44,209 --> 01:27:44,219
players players have to think you have
 

5145
01:27:44,219 --> 01:27:45,709
players players have to think you have
to use time and in those final critical

5146
01:27:45,709 --> 01:27:45,719
to use time and in those final critical
 

5147
01:27:45,719 --> 01:27:48,530
to use time and in those final critical
stages I just don't blunder I just don't

5148
01:27:48,530 --> 01:27:48,540
stages I just don't blunder I just don't
 

5149
01:27:48,540 --> 01:27:49,729
stages I just don't blunder I just don't
blunder really at the end of the day

5150
01:27:49,729 --> 01:27:49,739
blunder really at the end of the day
 

5151
01:27:49,739 --> 01:27:51,709
blunder really at the end of the day
that's that's really the only difference

5152
01:27:51,709 --> 01:27:51,719
that's that's really the only difference
 

5153
01:27:51,719 --> 01:27:54,110
that's that's really the only difference
because everybody's very very strong

5154
01:27:54,110 --> 01:27:54,120
because everybody's very very strong
 

5155
01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:56,090
because everybody's very very strong
but it's sort of like who is the who is

5156
01:27:56,090 --> 01:27:56,100
but it's sort of like who is the who is
 

5157
01:27:56,100 --> 01:27:57,649
but it's sort of like who is the who is
the better like brain who has a better

5158
01:27:57,649 --> 01:27:57,659
the better like brain who has a better
 

5159
01:27:57,659 --> 01:27:59,930
the better like brain who has a better
like CPU or for lack of a better way of

5160
01:27:59,930 --> 01:27:59,940
like CPU or for lack of a better way of
 

5161
01:27:59,940 --> 01:28:01,430
like CPU or for lack of a better way of
putting it it's like who makes a split

5162
01:28:01,430 --> 01:28:01,440
putting it it's like who makes a split
 

5163
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:04,010
putting it it's like who makes a split
to SEC Split Second decisions the best

5164
01:28:04,010 --> 01:28:04,020
to SEC Split Second decisions the best
 

5165
01:28:04,020 --> 01:28:07,310
to SEC Split Second decisions the best
and uh I do think that I'm extremely

5166
01:28:07,310 --> 01:28:07,320
and uh I do think that I'm extremely
 

5167
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:09,350
and uh I do think that I'm extremely
good at that in a way that almost nobody

5168
01:28:09,350 --> 01:28:09,360
good at that in a way that almost nobody
 

5169
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:10,970
good at that in a way that almost nobody
else is that that really is the only

5170
01:28:10,970 --> 01:28:10,980
else is that that really is the only
 

5171
01:28:10,980 --> 01:28:12,530
else is that that really is the only
difference is that those Split Second

5172
01:28:12,530 --> 01:28:12,540
difference is that those Split Second
 

5173
01:28:12,540 --> 01:28:14,149
difference is that those Split Second
decisions because you can get a worse

5174
01:28:14,149 --> 01:28:14,159
decisions because you can get a worse
 

5175
01:28:14,159 --> 01:28:15,530
decisions because you can get a worse
position but again if you keep the game

5176
01:28:15,530 --> 01:28:15,540
position but again if you keep the game
 

5177
01:28:15,540 --> 01:28:17,209
position but again if you keep the game
going players have to use a time when

5178
01:28:17,209 --> 01:28:17,219
going players have to use a time when
 

5179
01:28:17,219 --> 01:28:18,770
going players have to use a time when
you get down to those final 10 15

5180
01:28:18,770 --> 01:28:18,780
you get down to those final 10 15
 

5181
01:28:18,780 --> 01:28:21,110
you get down to those final 10 15
seconds uh I almost always end up

5182
01:28:21,110 --> 01:28:21,120
seconds uh I almost always end up
 

5183
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:23,330
seconds uh I almost always end up
winning in those situations what are you

5184
01:28:23,330 --> 01:28:23,340
winning in those situations what are you
 

5185
01:28:23,340 --> 01:28:25,430
winning in those situations what are you
visualizing like when it knows when

5186
01:28:25,430 --> 01:28:25,440
visualizing like when it knows when
 

5187
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:27,649
visualizing like when it knows when
you're doing the fast fast calculations

5188
01:28:27,649 --> 01:28:27,659
you're doing the fast fast calculations
 

5189
01:28:27,659 --> 01:28:30,709
you're doing the fast fast calculations
what what is it um it's basically you

5190
01:28:30,709 --> 01:28:30,719
what what is it um it's basically you
 

5191
01:28:30,719 --> 01:28:32,930
what what is it um it's basically you
look at a move and you see like when

5192
01:28:32,930 --> 01:28:32,940
look at a move and you see like when
 

5193
01:28:32,940 --> 01:28:34,129
look at a move and you see like when
it's like five seconds or ten seconds

5194
01:28:34,129 --> 01:28:34,139
it's like five seconds or ten seconds
 

5195
01:28:34,139 --> 01:28:35,450
it's like five seconds or ten seconds
you play a movie you just make sure that

5196
01:28:35,450 --> 01:28:35,460
you play a movie you just make sure that
 

5197
01:28:35,460 --> 01:28:36,709
you play a movie you just make sure that
it's not a blunder you just look make

5198
01:28:36,709 --> 01:28:36,719
it's not a blunder you just look make
 

5199
01:28:36,719 --> 01:28:38,570
it's not a blunder you just look make
sure it's not a blender and you just go

5200
01:28:38,570 --> 01:28:38,580
sure it's not a blender and you just go
 

5201
01:28:38,580 --> 01:28:39,890
sure it's not a blender and you just go
with it and the first part though is the

5202
01:28:39,890 --> 01:28:39,900
with it and the first part though is the
 

5203
01:28:39,900 --> 01:28:41,270
with it and the first part though is the
feel so it's like I see this move and it

5204
01:28:41,270 --> 01:28:41,280
feel so it's like I see this move and it
 

5205
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:42,830
feel so it's like I see this move and it
looks right I don't know why it's right

5206
01:28:42,830 --> 01:28:42,840
looks right I don't know why it's right
 

5207
01:28:42,840 --> 01:28:44,629
looks right I don't know why it's right
I can't put that into words but it looks

5208
01:28:44,629 --> 01:28:44,639
I can't put that into words but it looks
 

5209
01:28:44,639 --> 01:28:45,950
I can't put that into words but it looks
like the right move and then I look very

5210
01:28:45,950 --> 01:28:45,960
like the right move and then I look very
 

5211
01:28:45,960 --> 01:28:47,990
like the right move and then I look very
for like a split second see as long as

5212
01:28:47,990 --> 01:28:48,000
for like a split second see as long as
 

5213
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:49,129
for like a split second see as long as
it's not some kind of blender and you

5214
01:28:49,129 --> 01:28:49,139
it's not some kind of blender and you
 

5215
01:28:49,139 --> 01:28:51,110
it's not some kind of blender and you
just play that move is there a bit of a

5216
01:28:51,110 --> 01:28:51,120
just play that move is there a bit of a
 

5217
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:52,550
just play that move is there a bit of a
tunnel vision are you able to understand

5218
01:28:52,550 --> 01:28:52,560
tunnel vision are you able to understand
 

5219
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:54,470
tunnel vision are you able to understand
the positions of all the other pieces on

5220
01:28:54,470 --> 01:28:54,480
the positions of all the other pieces on
 

5221
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:56,090
the positions of all the other pieces on
the board or are you just focusing on a

5222
01:28:56,090 --> 01:28:56,100
the board or are you just focusing on a
 

5223
01:28:56,100 --> 01:28:58,070
the board or are you just focusing on a
very specific interaction it's just Phil

5224
01:28:58,070 --> 01:28:58,080
very specific interaction it's just Phil
 

5225
01:28:58,080 --> 01:28:59,510
very specific interaction it's just Phil
it's really just feel it's like this

5226
01:28:59,510 --> 01:28:59,520
it's really just feel it's like this
 

5227
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:01,610
it's really just feel it's like this
move feels right and so I play it when

5228
01:29:01,610 --> 01:29:01,620
move feels right and so I play it when
 

5229
01:29:01,620 --> 01:29:02,750
move feels right and so I play it when
you when you're at that stage of the

5230
01:29:02,750 --> 01:29:02,760
you when you're at that stage of the
 

5231
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:04,610
you when you're at that stage of the
game it's it's like as long as it's not

5232
01:29:04,610 --> 01:29:04,620
game it's it's like as long as it's not
 

5233
01:29:04,620 --> 01:29:06,709
game it's it's like as long as it's not
a blunder and it just that it's just

5234
01:29:06,709 --> 01:29:06,719
a blunder and it just that it's just
 

5235
01:29:06,719 --> 01:29:09,110
a blunder and it just that it's just
that feel there's there is no way for me

5236
01:29:09,110 --> 01:29:09,120
that feel there's there is no way for me
 

5237
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:11,689
that feel there's there is no way for me
to put that in and that feel

5238
01:29:11,689 --> 01:29:11,699
to put that in and that feel
 

5239
01:29:11,699 --> 01:29:15,050
to put that in and that feel
like empirically does result in low

5240
01:29:15,050 --> 01:29:15,060
like empirically does result in low
 

5241
01:29:15,060 --> 01:29:17,209
like empirically does result in low
probability of blunder for you yeah it's

5242
01:29:17,209 --> 01:29:17,219
probability of blunder for you yeah it's
 

5243
01:29:17,219 --> 01:29:19,129
probability of blunder for you yeah it's
like you don't blunder even though there

5244
01:29:19,129 --> 01:29:19,139
like you don't blunder even though there
 

5245
01:29:19,139 --> 01:29:21,110
like you don't blunder even though there
could be like you don't forget like a

5246
01:29:21,110 --> 01:29:21,120
could be like you don't forget like a
 

5247
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:23,570
could be like you don't forget like a
random piece that was like very very I

5248
01:29:23,570 --> 01:29:23,580
random piece that was like very very I
 

5249
01:29:23,580 --> 01:29:26,209
random piece that was like very very I
mean it does happen of course but very

5250
01:29:26,209 --> 01:29:26,219
mean it does happen of course but very
 

5251
01:29:26,219 --> 01:29:28,430
mean it does happen of course but very
rarely and I mean I've done it on stream

5252
01:29:28,430 --> 01:29:28,440
rarely and I mean I've done it on stream
 

5253
01:29:28,440 --> 01:29:30,470
rarely and I mean I've done it on stream
many times like it's just you you go

5254
01:29:30,470 --> 01:29:30,480
many times like it's just you you go
 

5255
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:32,149
many times like it's just you you go
with the move that for whatever reason

5256
01:29:32,149 --> 01:29:32,159
with the move that for whatever reason
 

5257
01:29:32,159 --> 01:29:34,669
with the move that for whatever reason
like it just intuitively whether it's

5258
01:29:34,669 --> 01:29:34,679
like it just intuitively whether it's
 

5259
01:29:34,679 --> 01:29:36,470
like it just intuitively whether it's
from playing hundreds of thousands of

5260
01:29:36,470 --> 01:29:36,480
from playing hundreds of thousands of
 

5261
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:38,270
from playing hundreds of thousands of
games on the internet

5262
01:29:38,270 --> 01:29:38,280
games on the internet
 

5263
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:39,950
games on the internet
um or just that that experience like it

5264
01:29:39,950 --> 01:29:39,960
um or just that that experience like it
 

5265
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:41,810
um or just that that experience like it
you just intuitively can can feel like

5266
01:29:41,810 --> 01:29:41,820
you just intuitively can can feel like
 

5267
01:29:41,820 --> 01:29:44,990
you just intuitively can can feel like
the move is right and so over those 300

5268
01:29:44,990 --> 01:29:45,000
the move is right and so over those 300
 

5269
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:46,310
the move is right and so over those 300
000 games

5270
01:29:46,310 --> 01:29:46,320
000 games
 

5271
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:49,430
000 games
played over the board online all kinds

um in 2010 where I offered a queen stock
 

5287
01:30:06,659 --> 01:30:08,750
um in 2010 where I offered a queen stock
I think on five consecutive moves second

5288
01:30:08,750 --> 01:30:08,760
I think on five consecutive moves second

take me to that game this is there's one
sequence in the late middle game where

5296
01:30:17,450 --> 01:30:17,460
sequence in the late middle game where
 

5297
01:30:17,460 --> 01:30:18,229
sequence in the late middle game where
um

5298
01:30:18,229 --> 01:30:18,239
um
 

5299
01:30:18,239 --> 01:30:21,050
um
it's funny because I actually I I think

this game to Peter actually Peter till
 

5305
01:30:24,420 --> 01:30:26,990
this game to Peter actually Peter till
and I confused the move order right in

5306
01:30:26,990 --> 01:30:27,000
and I confused the move order right in
 

5307
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:27,950
and I confused the move order right in
the late middle game so I don't want to

position with all the Pawns in diagonal

5336
01:31:00,110 --> 01:31:00,120
position with all the Pawns in diagonal
 

5337
01:31:00,120 --> 01:31:01,790
position with all the Pawns in diagonal
like this with the knives behind it this

5338
01:31:01,790 --> 01:31:01,800
like this with the knives behind it this
 

5339
01:31:01,800 --> 01:31:04,070
like this with the knives behind it this
looks this is this is no this is this

5340
01:31:04,070 --> 01:31:04,080
looks this is this is no this is this
 

5341
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:06,110
looks this is this is no this is this
nowadays this is very well known as a

5342
01:31:06,110 --> 01:31:06,120
nowadays this is very well known as a
 

5343
01:31:06,120 --> 01:31:07,669
nowadays this is very well known as a
standard Theory

5344
01:31:07,669 --> 01:31:07,679
standard Theory
 

5345
01:31:07,679 --> 01:31:10,070
standard Theory
um but at the time I I the reason that I

5346
01:31:10,070 --> 01:31:10,080
um but at the time I I the reason that I
 

5347
01:31:10,080 --> 01:31:11,510
um but at the time I I the reason that I
was aware of this is because I played a

5348
01:31:11,510 --> 01:31:11,520
was aware of this is because I played a
 

5349
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:13,189
was aware of this is because I played a
tournament I think in Montreal I think

5350
01:31:13,189 --> 01:31:13,199
tournament I think in Montreal I think
 

5351
01:31:13,199 --> 01:31:14,629
tournament I think in Montreal I think
it was Montreal like the year the summer

5352
01:31:14,629 --> 01:31:14,639
it was Montreal like the year the summer
 

5353
01:31:14,639 --> 01:31:16,370
it was Montreal like the year the summer
before and one of my friends had

5354
01:31:16,370 --> 01:31:16,380
before and one of my friends had
 

5355
01:31:16,380 --> 01:31:17,930
before and one of my friends had
actually played this variation with the

5356
01:31:17,930 --> 01:31:17,940
actually played this variation with the
 

5357
01:31:17,940 --> 01:31:20,330
actually played this variation with the
black pieces so I was aware of it and it

5358
01:31:20,330 --> 01:31:20,340
black pieces so I was aware of it and it
 

5359
01:31:20,340 --> 01:31:22,790
black pieces so I was aware of it and it
seemed very dangerous but from the black

5360
01:31:22,790 --> 01:31:22,800
seemed very dangerous but from the black
 

5361
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:24,770
seemed very dangerous but from the black
perspective yeah I feel like it's very

5362
01:31:24,770 --> 01:31:24,780
perspective yeah I feel like it's very
 

5363
01:31:24,780 --> 01:31:26,149
perspective yeah I feel like it's very
hard for white to play very hard for

5364
01:31:26,149 --> 01:31:26,159
hard for white to play very hard for
 

5365
01:31:26,159 --> 01:31:28,129
hard for white to play very hard for
white to play it felt feels like you're

5366
01:31:28,129 --> 01:31:28,139
white to play it felt feels like you're
 

5367
01:31:28,139 --> 01:31:29,750
white to play it felt feels like you're
getting attacked your king you see the

5368
01:31:29,750 --> 01:31:29,760
getting attacked your king you see the
 

5369
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:31,129
getting attacked your king you see the
black pawns are coming down towards the

5370
01:31:31,129 --> 01:31:31,139
black pawns are coming down towards the
 

5371
01:31:31,139 --> 01:31:33,050
black pawns are coming down towards the
king and it's very hard to defend and

5372
01:31:33,050 --> 01:31:33,060
king and it's very hard to defend and
 

5373
01:31:33,060 --> 01:31:35,209
king and it's very hard to defend and
also a lot of players don't like being

5374
01:31:35,209 --> 01:31:35,219
also a lot of players don't like being
 

5375
01:31:35,219 --> 01:31:37,070
also a lot of players don't like being
attacked generally you try to avoid

5376
01:31:37,070 --> 01:31:37,080
attacked generally you try to avoid
 

5377
01:31:37,080 --> 01:31:38,510
attacked generally you try to avoid
positions where your king is under Fire

5378
01:31:38,510 --> 01:31:38,520
positions where your king is under Fire
 

5379
01:31:38,520 --> 01:31:40,490
positions where your king is under Fire
which comes back to what I said about

5380
01:31:40,490 --> 01:31:40,500
which comes back to what I said about
 

5381
01:31:40,500 --> 01:31:42,350
which comes back to what I said about
Magnus as well like he doesn't like it

5382
01:31:42,350 --> 01:31:42,360
Magnus as well like he doesn't like it
 

5383
01:31:42,360 --> 01:31:44,450
Magnus as well like he doesn't like it
when his King is under Fire and so

5384
01:31:44,450 --> 01:31:44,460
when his King is under Fire and so
 

5385
01:31:44,460 --> 01:31:45,649
when his King is under Fire and so
therefore

5386
01:31:45,649 --> 01:31:45,659
therefore
 

5387
01:31:45,659 --> 01:31:47,209
therefore
um You Can't Always Get that because

5388
01:31:47,209 --> 01:31:47,219
um You Can't Always Get that because
 

5389
01:31:47,219 --> 01:31:49,010
um You Can't Always Get that because
White had to play along to get to this

5390
01:31:49,010 --> 01:31:49,020
White had to play along to get to this
 

5391
01:31:49,020 --> 01:31:50,570
White had to play along to get to this
point as well if white didn't want

5392
01:31:50,570 --> 01:31:50,580
point as well if white didn't want
 

5393
01:31:50,580 --> 01:31:53,090
point as well if white didn't want
something this uh this double-edged and

5394
01:31:53,090 --> 01:31:53,100
something this uh this double-edged and
 

5395
01:31:53,100 --> 01:31:54,709
something this uh this double-edged and
just complicated he could have avoided

5396
01:31:54,709 --> 01:31:54,719

5569
01:34:58,560 --> 01:34:59,689
the queen because it'd be Checkmate got
it

5570
01:34:59,689 --> 01:34:59,699
it
 

5571
01:34:59,699 --> 01:35:01,430
it
so constantly and that's what you mean

5572
01:35:01,430 --> 01:35:01,440
so constantly and that's what you mean
 

5573
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:02,750

by sacrifice he didn't actually yeah
yeah he couldn't take you to have gotten

5576
01:35:04,610 --> 01:35:04,620
yeah he couldn't take you to have gotten
 

5577
01:35:04,620 --> 01:35:06,470
yeah he couldn't take you to have gotten
checkmated but anyways Smoke Clears and

5578
01:35:06,470 --> 01:35:06,480
checkmated but anyways Smoke Clears and
 

5579
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:08,750
checkmated but anyways Smoke Clears and
I'm up material here and and I win this

5580
01:35:08,750 --> 01:35:08,760
I'm up material here and and I win this
 

5581
01:35:08,760 --> 01:35:10,430
I'm up material here and and I win this
game so this is the game that I would

5582
01:35:10,430 --> 01:35:10,440
game so this is the game that I would
 

5583
01:35:10,440 --> 01:35:12,770
game so this is the game that I would
say it's like why why why did it stand

5584
01:35:12,770 --> 01:35:12,780
say it's like why why why did it stand
 

5585
01:35:12,780 --> 01:35:14,570
say it's like why why why did it stand
out I mean it's beautiful but just the

5586
01:35:14,570 --> 01:35:14,580
out I mean it's beautiful but just the
 

5587
01:35:14,580 --> 01:35:16,070
out I mean it's beautiful but just the
fact that

5588
01:35:16,070 --> 01:35:16,080
fact that
 

5589
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:17,930
fact that
um it's mainly that I was able to offer

5590
01:35:17,930 --> 01:35:17,940
um it's mainly that I was able to offer
 

5591
01:35:17,940 --> 01:35:19,729
um it's mainly that I was able to offer
the queen sacrifice so many moves in a

5592
01:35:19,729 --> 01:35:19,739
the queen sacrifice so many moves in a
 

5593
01:35:19,739 --> 01:35:21,770
the queen sacrifice so many moves in a
row you almost never have that

5594
01:35:21,770 --> 01:35:21,780
row you almost never have that
 

5595
01:35:21,780 --> 01:35:23,149
row you almost never have that
opportunity

5596
01:35:23,149 --> 01:35:23,159
opportunity
 

5597
01:35:23,159 --> 01:35:24,530
opportunity
um and actually normally the games

5598
01:35:24,530 --> 01:35:24,540
um and actually normally the games
 

5599
01:35:24,540 --> 01:35:25,550
um and actually normally the games
you're going to consider your best

5600
01:35:25,550 --> 01:35:25,560
you're going to consider your best
 

5601
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:27,770
you're going to consider your best
involve sacrifices and if you can

5602
01:35:27,770 --> 01:35:27,780
involve sacrifices and if you can
 

5603
01:35:27,780 --> 01:35:29,570
involve sacrifices and if you can
sacrifice the queen that makes it uh

5604
01:35:29,570 --> 01:35:29,580
sacrifice the queen that makes it uh
 

5605
01:35:29,580 --> 01:35:30,709
sacrifice the queen that makes it uh
very memorable there's just this

5606
01:35:30,709 --> 01:35:30,719
very memorable there's just this
 

5607
01:35:30,719 --> 01:35:33,110
very memorable there's just this
constant theme of uh this this one

5608
01:35:33,110 --> 01:35:33,120
constant theme of uh this this one
 

5609
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:36,290
constant theme of uh this this one
Checkmate idea how often do you

5610
01:35:36,290 --> 01:35:36,300
Checkmate idea how often do you
 

5611
01:35:36,300 --> 01:35:39,350
Checkmate idea how often do you
play with the sacrifice of a major piece

5612
01:35:39,350 --> 01:35:39,360
play with the sacrifice of a major piece
 

5613
01:35:39,360 --> 01:35:40,790
play with the sacrifice of a major piece
like how often do you find yourself in

5614
01:35:40,790 --> 01:35:40,800
like how often do you find yourself in
 

5615
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:42,229
like how often do you find yourself in
that position pretty rare because

5616
01:35:42,229 --> 01:35:42,239
that position pretty rare because
 

5617
01:35:42,239 --> 01:35:44,030
that position pretty rare because
players tend to avoid these sorts of

5618
01:35:44,030 --> 01:35:44,040
players tend to avoid these sorts of
 

5619
01:35:44,040 --> 01:35:46,729
players tend to avoid these sorts of
situations players don't like games that

5620
01:35:46,729 --> 01:35:46,739
situations players don't like games that
 

5621
01:35:46,739 --> 01:35:49,610
situations players don't like games that
can go either way so when when like both

5622
01:35:49,610 --> 01:35:49,620
can go either way so when when like both
 

5623
01:35:49,620 --> 01:35:51,950
can go either way so when when like both
players have to sort of cooperate you

5624
01:35:51,950 --> 01:35:51,960
players have to sort of cooperate you
 

5625
01:35:51,960 --> 01:35:54,229
players have to sort of cooperate you
have to want that kind of game in order

5626
01:35:54,229 --> 01:35:54,239
have to want that kind of game in order
 

5627
01:35:54,239 --> 01:35:56,570
have to want that kind of game in order
for that situation to arise and a lot of

5628
01:35:56,570 --> 01:35:56,580
for that situation to arise and a lot of
 

5629
01:35:56,580 --> 01:35:58,850
for that situation to arise and a lot of
games at the top neither player wants to

5630
01:35:58,850 --> 01:35:58,860
games at the top neither player wants to
 

5631
01:35:58,860 --> 01:36:00,530
games at the top neither player wants to
go into that situation for the most part

5632
01:36:00,530 --> 01:36:00,540
go into that situation for the most part
 

5633
01:36:00,540 --> 01:36:02,149
go into that situation for the most part
so you don't really have those

5634
01:36:02,149 --> 01:36:02,159
so you don't really have those
 

5635
01:36:02,159 --> 01:36:04,550
so you don't really have those
opportunities

5636
01:36:04,550 --> 01:36:04,560
opportunities
 

5637
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:06,890
opportunities
nevertheless stockfish loves those

5638
01:36:06,890 --> 01:36:06,900
nevertheless stockfish loves those
 

5639
01:36:06,900 --> 01:36:09,830
nevertheless stockfish loves those
opportunities the yeah the sacrifices

5640
01:36:09,830 --> 01:36:09,840
opportunities the yeah the sacrifices
 

5641
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:11,750
opportunities the yeah the sacrifices
well that's one thing also that we're

5642
01:36:11,750 --> 01:36:11,760
well that's one thing also that we're
 

5643
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:13,669
well that's one thing also that we're
starting to learn more and more is that

5644
01:36:13,669 --> 01:36:13,679
starting to learn more and more is that
 

5645
01:36:13,679 --> 01:36:15,350
starting to learn more and more is that
stockfish and the other programs they

5646
01:36:15,350 --> 01:36:15,360
stockfish and the other programs they
 

5647
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:17,090
stockfish and the other programs they
don't care about pawns you can sacrifice

5648
01:36:17,090 --> 01:36:17,100
don't care about pawns you can sacrifice
 

5649
01:36:17,100 --> 01:36:19,189
don't care about pawns you can sacrifice
one pawn two pawns three Pawns in a lot

5650
01:36:19,189 --> 01:36:19,199
one pawn two pawns three Pawns in a lot
 

5651
01:36:19,199 --> 01:36:21,410
one pawn two pawns three Pawns in a lot
of cases if the rest of your pieces are

5652
01:36:21,410 --> 01:36:21,420
of cases if the rest of your pieces are
 

5653
01:36:21,420 --> 01:36:23,330
of cases if the rest of your pieces are
very active and that's something that we

5654
01:36:23,330 --> 01:36:23,340
very active and that's something that we
 

5655
01:36:23,340 --> 01:36:26,149
very active and that's something that we
kind of knew on a basic level about the

5656
01:36:26,149 --> 01:36:26,159
kind of knew on a basic level about the
 

5657
01:36:26,159 --> 01:36:27,530
kind of knew on a basic level about the
initiative is what we call it in chess

5658
01:36:27,530 --> 01:36:27,540
initiative is what we call it in chess
 

5659
01:36:27,540 --> 01:36:28,790
initiative is what we call it in chess
where like you'll give up material but

5660
01:36:28,790 --> 01:36:28,800
where like you'll give up material but
 

5661
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:30,530
where like you'll give up material but
your pieces are very well placed but we

5662
01:36:30,530 --> 01:36:30,540
your pieces are very well placed but we
 

5663
01:36:30,540 --> 01:36:32,450
your pieces are very well placed but we
didn't realize just how how important

5664
01:36:32,450 --> 01:36:32,460
didn't realize just how how important
 

5665
01:36:32,460 --> 01:36:34,189
didn't realize just how how important
that is and computers will do that all

5666
01:36:34,189 --> 01:36:34,199
that is and computers will do that all
 

5667
01:36:34,199 --> 01:36:35,930
that is and computers will do that all
the time now all the time and even

5668
01:36:35,930 --> 01:36:35,940
the time now all the time and even
 

5669
01:36:35,940 --> 01:36:37,970
the time now all the time and even
actually like they're in this variant

5670
01:36:37,970 --> 01:36:37,980
actually like they're in this variant
 

5671
01:36:37,980 --> 01:36:39,649
actually like they're in this variant
Fisher random is another another variant

5672
01:36:39,649 --> 01:36:39,659
Fisher random is another another variant
 

5673
01:36:39,659 --> 01:36:40,910
Fisher random is another another variant
where you arrange a piece on the back

5674
01:36:40,910 --> 01:36:40,920
where you arrange a piece on the back
 

5675
01:36:40,920 --> 01:36:42,770
where you arrange a piece on the back
row they will gladly sack Rooks for

5676
01:36:42,770 --> 01:36:42,780
row they will gladly sack Rooks for
 

5677
01:36:42,780 --> 01:36:45,590
row they will gladly sack Rooks for
Bishops or for Knights all the time all

5678
01:36:45,590 --> 01:36:45,600
Bishops or for Knights all the time all
 

5679
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:48,229
Bishops or for Knights all the time all
the time and so you take from that

5680
01:36:48,229 --> 01:36:48,239
the time and so you take from that
 

5681
01:36:48,239 --> 01:36:50,629
the time and so you take from that
material imbalance or the material you

5682
01:36:50,629 --> 01:36:50,639
material imbalance or the material you
 

5683
01:36:50,639 --> 01:36:52,490
material imbalance or the material you
give up doesn't matter as much as having

5684
01:36:52,490 --> 01:36:52,500
give up doesn't matter as much as having
 

5685
01:36:52,500 --> 01:36:54,830
give up doesn't matter as much as having
this this attack or having this piece on

5686
01:36:54,830 --> 01:36:54,840
this this attack or having this piece on
 

5687
01:36:54,840 --> 01:36:57,110
this this attack or having this piece on
certain squares well as long as you can

5688
01:36:57,110 --> 01:36:57,120
certain squares well as long as you can
 

5689
01:36:57,120 --> 01:36:59,330
certain squares well as long as you can
hold on to the attack right and

5690
01:36:59,330 --> 01:36:59,340
hold on to the attack right and
 

5691
01:36:59,340 --> 01:37:01,310
hold on to the attack right and
computers can't but yeah it's also very

5692
01:37:01,310 --> 01:37:01,320
computers can't but yeah it's also very
 

5693
01:37:01,320 --> 01:37:02,689
computers can't but yeah it's also very
tricky because when we as humans

5694
01:37:02,689 --> 01:37:02,699
tricky because when we as humans
 

5695
01:37:02,699 --> 01:37:04,250
tricky because when we as humans
sometimes you'll look at our opening

5696
01:37:04,250 --> 01:37:04,260
sometimes you'll look at our opening
 

5697
01:37:04,260 --> 01:37:06,229
sometimes you'll look at our opening
variation and you'll see something like

5698
01:37:06,229 --> 01:37:06,239
variation and you'll see something like
 

5699
01:37:06,239 --> 01:37:07,729
variation and you'll see something like
this and you want to do it in a game but

5700
01:37:07,729 --> 01:37:07,739
this and you want to do it in a game but
 

5701
01:37:07,739 --> 01:37:10,310
this and you want to do it in a game but
the problem is we don't know how we're

5702
01:37:10,310 --> 01:37:10,320
the problem is we don't know how we're
 

5703
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:12,470
the problem is we don't know how we're
supposed to follow it up afterwards yeah

5704
01:37:12,470 --> 01:37:12,480
supposed to follow it up afterwards yeah
 

5705
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:14,390
supposed to follow it up afterwards yeah
and so if you do that and you don't know

5706
01:37:14,390 --> 01:37:14,400
and so if you do that and you don't know
 

5707
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:15,770
and so if you do that and you don't know
how to follow up afterwards very

5708
01:37:15,770 --> 01:37:15,780
how to follow up afterwards very
 

5709
01:37:15,780 --> 01:37:17,810
how to follow up afterwards very
oftentimes we'll make mistakes we'll try

5710
01:37:17,810 --> 01:37:17,820
oftentimes we'll make mistakes we'll try
 

5711
01:37:17,820 --> 01:37:19,250
oftentimes we'll make mistakes we'll try
to look in a human way and then of

5712
01:37:19,250 --> 01:37:19,260
to look in a human way and then of
 

5713
01:37:19,260 --> 01:37:21,169
to look in a human way and then of
course all you end up losing in the long

5714
01:37:21,169 --> 01:37:21,179
course all you end up losing in the long
 

5715
01:37:21,179 --> 01:37:22,550
course all you end up losing in the long
term because you've given up too much

5716
01:37:22,550 --> 01:37:22,560
term because you've given up too much
 

5717
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:24,169
term because you've given up too much
material so it's a very double-edged

5718
01:37:24,169 --> 01:37:24,179
material so it's a very double-edged
 

5719
01:37:24,179 --> 01:37:26,149
material so it's a very double-edged
sword but that's why it's dramatic and

like the 20th move roughly what's the uh

5754

vulnerable in this position see but
 

5809
01:39:09,420 --> 01:39:11,090
vulnerable in this position see but
you're gonna have to keep checking here

5810
01:39:11,090 --> 01:39:11,100
you're gonna have to keep checking here

night checks did you see all of this

5816
01:39:21,830 --> 01:39:21,840
night checks did you see all of this
 

5817
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:24,110
night checks did you see all of this
ahead yeah I mean I had not all of it

5818
01:39:24,110 --> 01:39:24,120
ahead yeah I mean I had not all of it
 

5819
01:39:24,120 --> 01:39:26,030
ahead yeah I mean I had not all of it
but I I figured there had to be some way

5820
01:39:26,030 --> 01:39:26,040
but I I figured there had to be some way
 

5821
01:39:26,040 --> 01:39:27,770
but I I figured there had to be some way
to win here with the King too many

5822
01:39:27,770 --> 01:39:27,780
to win here with the King too many
 

5823
01:39:27,780 --> 01:39:29,629
to win here with the King too many
attacking pieces in your end that could

5824
01:39:29,629 --> 01:39:29,639
attacking pieces in your end that could
 

5825
01:39:29,639 --> 01:39:32,209
attacking pieces in your end that could
duel well it's just basically the king

5826
01:39:32,209 --> 01:39:32,219
duel well it's just basically the king
 

5827
01:39:32,219 --> 01:39:33,770
duel well it's just basically the king
the only piece that can sort of guard

5828
01:39:33,770 --> 01:39:33,780
the only piece that can sort of guard
 

5829
01:39:33,780 --> 01:39:35,510
the only piece that can sort of guard
the king is the queen on D1 that's the

5830
01:39:35,510 --> 01:39:35,520
the king is the queen on D1 that's the
 

5831
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:37,250
the king is the queen on D1 that's the
only piece if I can just keep checking

5832
01:39:37,250 --> 01:39:37,260
only piece if I can just keep checking
 

5833
01:39:37,260 --> 01:39:39,709
only piece if I can just keep checking
I'm gonna be able to win win here so it

5834
01:39:39,709 --> 01:39:39,719
I'm gonna be able to win win here so it
 

5835
01:39:39,719 --> 01:39:41,270
I'm gonna be able to win win here so it
goes there and now I think I played yeah

5836
01:39:41,270 --> 01:39:41,280
goes there and now I think I played yeah
 

5837
01:39:41,280 --> 01:39:43,669
goes there and now I think I played yeah
I played this move oh no check because

5838
01:39:43,669 --> 01:39:43,679
I played this move oh no check because
 

5839
01:39:43,679 --> 01:39:44,930
I played this move oh no check because
I'm threatening to move the Rook over

5840
01:39:44,930 --> 01:39:44,940
I'm threatening to move the Rook over
 

5841
01:39:44,940 --> 01:39:47,810
I'm threatening to move the Rook over
one square and make a Checkmate got it

5842
01:39:47,810 --> 01:39:47,820
one square and make a Checkmate got it
 

5843
01:39:47,820 --> 01:39:49,850
one square and make a Checkmate got it
and then the rule was that the Rook

5844
01:39:49,850 --> 01:39:49,860
and then the rule was that the Rook
 

5845
01:39:49,860 --> 01:39:51,770
and then the rule was that the Rook
takes your knight

5846
01:39:51,770 --> 01:39:51,780
takes your knight
 

5847
01:39:51,780 --> 01:39:55,129
takes your knight
and then you take it right back with a

5848
01:39:55,129 --> 01:39:55,139
and then you take it right back with a
 

5849
01:39:55,139 --> 01:39:57,229
and then you take it right back with a
check

5850
01:39:57,229 --> 01:39:57,239

well he resigned yeah hey did resign
 

5861
01:40:06,900 --> 01:40:08,209
well he resigned yeah hey did resign
here yeah because I just moved the Rook

5862
01:40:08,209 --> 01:40:08,219
here yeah because I just moved the Rook
 

5863
01:40:08,219 --> 01:40:09,950
here yeah because I just moved the Rook
over to that dark Square in front of the

5864
01:40:09,950 --> 01:40:09,960
over to that dark Square in front of the
 

5865
01:40:09,960 --> 01:40:11,750
over to that dark Square in front of the
pawn and that would be Chuck mate

5866
01:40:11,750 --> 01:40:11,760
pawn and that would be Chuck mate
 

5867
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:14,570
pawn and that would be Chuck mate
dark Square in front of the pawn so 86

5868
01:40:14,570 --> 01:40:14,580
dark Square in front of the pawn so 86
 

5869
01:40:14,580 --> 01:40:16,250
dark Square in front of the pawn so 86
yeah because now the bishop covers the

5870
01:40:16,250 --> 01:40:16,260
yeah because now the bishop covers the
 

5871
01:40:16,260 --> 01:40:17,629
yeah because now the bishop covers the
light square is there something he can

5872
01:40:17,629 --> 01:40:17,639
light square is there something he can
 

5873
01:40:17,639 --> 01:40:19,669
light square is there something he can
do to to mess

5874
01:40:19,669 --> 01:40:19,679
do to to mess
 

5875
01:40:19,679 --> 01:40:21,110
do to to mess
um not really there I don't think

5876
01:40:21,110 --> 01:40:21,120
um not really there I don't think
 

5877
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:22,729
um not really there I don't think
there's nothing with a queen Chuck mate

5878
01:40:22,729 --> 01:40:22,739
there's nothing with a queen Chuck mate
 

5879
01:40:22,739 --> 01:40:24,590
there's nothing with a queen Chuck mate
nothing with the queen I guess he's

5880
01:40:24,590 --> 01:40:24,600
nothing with the queen I guess he's
 

5881
01:40:24,600 --> 01:40:26,990
nothing with the queen I guess he's
gonna lose the queen yeah I think it's

5882
01:40:26,990 --> 01:40:27,000
gonna lose the queen yeah I think it's
 

5883
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:28,610
gonna lose the queen yeah I think it's
just actually Force Checkmate here in a

5884
01:40:28,610 --> 01:40:28,620
just actually Force Checkmate here in a
 

5885
01:40:28,620 --> 01:40:29,629
just actually Force Checkmate here in a
couple of moves I don't think there's

5886
01:40:29,629 --> 01:40:29,639
couple of moves I don't think there's
 

5887
01:40:29,639 --> 01:40:32,870
couple of moves I don't think there's
any way to stop it even if he loses his

5888
01:40:32,870 --> 01:40:32,880
any way to stop it even if he loses his
 

5889
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:36,590
any way to stop it even if he loses his
Queens yeah it's it's a force checkmate

5890
01:40:36,590 --> 01:40:36,600
Queens yeah it's it's a force checkmate
 

5891
01:40:36,600 --> 01:40:39,290
Queens yeah it's it's a force checkmate
fascinating and so like that you you

5892
01:40:39,290 --> 01:40:39,300
fascinating and so like that you you
 

5893
01:40:39,300 --> 01:40:41,270
fascinating and so like that you you
can't purely calculate but you can have

5894
01:40:41,270 --> 01:40:41,280
can't purely calculate but you can have
 

5895
01:40:41,280 --> 01:40:43,310
can't purely calculate but you can have
some intuition also I think what it is

5896
01:40:43,310 --> 01:40:43,320
some intuition also I think what it is
 

5897
01:40:43,320 --> 01:40:45,830
some intuition also I think what it is
is in such situations you know that

5898
01:40:45,830 --> 01:40:45,840
is in such situations you know that
 

5899
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:47,270
is in such situations you know that
there is at least a draw I could always

5900
01:40:47,270 --> 01:40:47,280
there is at least a draw I could always
 

5901
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:49,250
there is at least a draw I could always
just check him with my Rook if I wanted

5902
01:40:49,250 --> 01:40:49,260
just check him with my Rook if I wanted
 

5903
01:40:49,260 --> 01:40:51,110
just check him with my Rook if I wanted
to to make a draw so that also gives me

5904
01:40:51,110 --> 01:40:51,120
to to make a draw so that also gives me
 

5905
01:40:51,120 --> 01:40:53,390
to to make a draw so that also gives me
some margin where if I calculate after I

5906
01:40:53,390 --> 01:40:53,400
some margin where if I calculate after I
 

5907
01:40:53,400 --> 01:40:54,709
some margin where if I calculate after I
play the move and I calculate it doesn't

5908
01:40:54,709 --> 01:40:54,719
play the move and I calculate it doesn't
 

5909
01:40:54,719 --> 01:40:57,530
play the move and I calculate it doesn't
work out I can still make the draw

5910
01:40:57,530 --> 01:40:57,540
work out I can still make the draw
 

5911
01:40:57,540 --> 01:41:00,410
work out I can still make the draw
are you uh I mean for fun dude do you do

5912
01:41:00,410 --> 01:41:00,420
are you uh I mean for fun dude do you do
 

5913
01:41:00,420 --> 01:41:02,450
are you uh I mean for fun dude do you do
the sacrifices of this sort when it's

5914
01:41:02,450 --> 01:41:02,460
the sacrifices of this sort when it's
 

5915
01:41:02,460 --> 01:41:04,729
the sacrifices of this sort when it's
not the serious competitive uh online

5916
01:41:04,729 --> 01:41:04,739
not the serious competitive uh online
 

5917
01:41:04,739 --> 01:41:06,770
not the serious competitive uh online
events or over the board I do actually

5918
01:41:06,770 --> 01:41:06,780
events or over the board I do actually
 

5919
01:41:06,780 --> 01:41:08,149
events or over the board I do actually
do this quite frequently and I wish

5920
01:41:08,149 --> 01:41:08,159
do this quite frequently and I wish
 

5921
01:41:08,159 --> 01:41:10,250
do this quite frequently and I wish
there were more opportunities but top

5922
01:41:10,250 --> 01:41:10,260
there were more opportunities but top
 

5923
01:41:10,260 --> 01:41:12,290
there were more opportunities but top
level chess it's it's become harder and

5924
01:41:12,290 --> 01:41:12,300
level chess it's it's become harder and
 

5925
01:41:12,300 --> 01:41:13,990
level chess it's it's become harder and
harder because due to computers

5926
01:41:13,990 --> 01:41:14,000
harder because due to computers
 

5927
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,070
harder because due to computers
everybody's very very well prepared in

5928
01:41:16,070 --> 01:41:16,080
everybody's very very well prepared in
 

5929
01:41:16,080 --> 01:41:17,629
everybody's very very well prepared in
the opening they know the first like 15

5930
01:41:17,629 --> 01:41:17,639
the opening they know the first like 15
 

5931
01:41:17,639 --> 01:41:20,689
the opening they know the first like 15
to 20 move sequences and no matter what

5932
01:41:20,689 --> 01:41:20,699
to 20 move sequences and no matter what
 

5933
01:41:20,699 --> 01:41:22,850
to 20 move sequences and no matter what
you do so it's very the the room for

5934
01:41:22,850 --> 01:41:22,860
you do so it's very the the room for
 

5935
01:41:22,860 --> 01:41:24,709
you do so it's very the the room for
creativity is less and less which makes

5936
01:41:24,709 --> 01:41:24,719
creativity is less and less which makes
 

5937
01:41:24,719 --> 01:41:26,750
creativity is less and less which makes
it which means you have less less of

5938
01:41:26,750 --> 01:41:26,760
it which means you have less less of
 

5939
01:41:26,760 --> 01:41:29,470
it which means you have less less of
those types of games I think you played

5940
01:41:29,470 --> 01:41:29,480
those types of games I think you played
 

5941
01:41:29,480 --> 01:41:33,169
those types of games I think you played
uh Levy Gotham chess with the with the

5942
01:41:33,169 --> 01:41:33,179
uh Levy Gotham chess with the with the
 

5943
01:41:33,179 --> 01:41:34,370
uh Levy Gotham chess with the with the
Without a Queen

5944
01:41:34,370 --> 01:41:34,380
Without a Queen
 

5945
01:41:34,380 --> 01:41:35,750
Without a Queen
was that a thing I think that was a

5946
01:41:35,750 --> 01:41:35,760
was that a thing I think that was a
 

5947
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:37,189
was that a thing I think that was a
bullet game yeah the one minute game I

5948
01:41:37,189 --> 01:41:37,199
bullet game yeah the one minute game I
 

5949
01:41:37,199 --> 01:41:38,990
bullet game yeah the one minute game I
think so yeah is that an actual thing

5950
01:41:38,990 --> 01:41:39,000
think so yeah is that an actual thing
 

5951
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:40,790
think so yeah is that an actual thing
that you can pull off like would you be

5952
01:41:40,790 --> 01:41:40,800
that you can pull off like would you be
 

5953
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:42,649
that you can pull off like would you be
like Levy or yeah can somebody like Levy

5954
01:41:42,649 --> 01:41:42,659
like Levy or yeah can somebody like Levy
 

5955
01:41:42,659 --> 01:41:45,470
like Levy or yeah can somebody like Levy
and bullet maybe I can win like 50 it'll

5956
01:41:45,470 --> 01:41:45,480
and bullet maybe I can win like 50 it'll
 

5957
01:41:45,480 --> 01:41:46,729
and bullet maybe I can win like 50 it'll
probably be what's bullet What's the

5958
01:41:46,729 --> 01:41:46,739
probably be what's bullet What's the
 

5959
01:41:46,739 --> 01:41:48,770
probably be what's bullet What's the
timing on the whole game one minute for

5960
01:41:48,770 --> 01:41:48,780
timing on the whole game one minute for

the whole game okay what about I mean
how much do you miss the queen if it's

5964
01:41:53,870 --> 01:41:53,880
how much do you miss the queen if it's
 

5965

you know in a bowl game like I said
 

5969
01:41:58,739 --> 01:42:01,250
you know in a bowl game like I said
maybe in bullet I can maybe score 50 in

5970
01:42:01,250 --> 01:42:01,260
maybe in bullet I can maybe score 50 in
 

5971

on the topic of goat let me ask uh about
Paul morphy

5982
01:42:13,910 --> 01:42:13,920
Paul morphy
 

5983
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:17,090
Paul morphy
how good was he uh Reddit asked me to

5984
01:42:17,090 --> 01:42:17,100
how good was he uh Reddit asked me to
 

5985
01:42:17,100 --> 01:42:19,370
how good was he uh Reddit asked me to
ask you about this and and why is he a

5986
01:42:19,370 --> 01:42:19,380
ask you about this and and why is he a

morphe was the best player in the world

5990
01:42:23,870 --> 01:42:23,880
morphe was the best player in the world
 

5991
01:42:23,880 --> 01:42:26,270
morphe was the best player in the world
by a bigger margin probably than anyone

5992
01:42:26,270 --> 01:42:26,280
by a bigger margin probably than anyone
 

5993
01:42:26,280 --> 01:42:28,609
by a bigger margin probably than anyone
else in recent modern history he was I

5994
01:42:28,609 --> 01:42:28,619
else in recent modern history he was I
 

5995
01:42:28,619 --> 01:42:30,770
else in recent modern history he was I
would say roughly using today's ratings

5996
01:42:30,770 --> 01:42:30,780
would say roughly using today's ratings
 

5997
01:42:30,780 --> 01:42:33,530
would say roughly using today's ratings
around like 2 400 in my opinion and the

5998
01:42:33,530 --> 01:42:33,540
around like 2 400 in my opinion and the
 

5999
01:42:33,540 --> 01:42:34,669
around like 2 400 in my opinion and the
other best players were maybe around

6000
01:42:34,669 --> 01:42:34,679
other best players were maybe around
 

6001
01:42:34,679 --> 01:42:38,209
other best players were maybe around
2000 or 2100 at best so he's the best

6002
01:42:38,209 --> 01:42:38,219
2000 or 2100 at best so he's the best
 

6003
01:42:38,219 --> 01:42:40,010
2000 or 2100 at best so he's the best
player by a bigger margin Fisher for

6004
01:42:40,010 --> 01:42:40,020
player by a bigger margin Fisher for
 

6005
01:42:40,020 --> 01:42:42,290
player by a bigger margin Fisher for
example I think it was about 170-ish

6006
01:42:42,290 --> 01:42:42,300
example I think it was about 170-ish
 

6007
01:42:42,300 --> 01:42:45,109
example I think it was about 170-ish
points um better than Boris baskey but

6008
01:42:45,109 --> 01:42:45,119
points um better than Boris baskey but
 

6009
01:42:45,119 --> 01:42:47,870
points um better than Boris baskey but
morphy was 300 plus at least now by

6010
01:42:47,870 --> 01:42:47,880
morphy was 300 plus at least now by
 

6011
01:42:47,880 --> 01:42:49,129
morphy was 300 plus at least now by
modern standards he would probably be a

6012
01:42:49,129 --> 01:42:49,139
modern standards he would probably be a
 

6013
01:42:49,139 --> 01:42:51,410
modern standards he would probably be a
very strong I am uh which you know is

6014
01:42:51,410 --> 01:42:51,420
very strong I am uh which you know is
 

6015
01:42:51,420 --> 01:42:53,209
very strong I am uh which you know is
isn't saying a whole lot but at the time

6016
01:42:53,209 --> 01:42:53,219
isn't saying a whole lot but at the time
 

6017
01:42:53,219 --> 01:42:55,910
isn't saying a whole lot but at the time
no one was even close so I don't think

6018
01:42:55,910 --> 01:42:55,920
no one was even close so I don't think
 

6019
01:42:55,920 --> 01:42:58,550
no one was even close so I don't think
you can put him in that category of like

6020
01:42:58,550 --> 01:42:58,560
you can put him in that category of like
 

6021
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:00,890
you can put him in that category of like
best ever simply because he was not the

6022
01:43:00,890 --> 01:43:00,900
best ever simply because he was not the
 

6023
01:43:00,900 --> 01:43:02,390
best ever simply because he was not the
best player for a long enough period of

6024
01:43:02,390 --> 01:43:02,400
best player for a long enough period of
 

6025
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:03,290
best player for a long enough period of
time

6026
01:43:03,290 --> 01:43:03,300
time
 

6027
01:43:03,300 --> 01:43:05,390
time
um as far as why it's tragic it's very

6028
01:43:05,390 --> 01:43:05,400
um as far as why it's tragic it's very
 

6029
01:43:05,400 --> 01:43:07,189
um as far as why it's tragic it's very
tragic because he essentially quit chess

6030
01:43:07,189 --> 01:43:07,199
tragic because he essentially quit chess
 

6031
01:43:07,199 --> 01:43:09,770
tragic because he essentially quit chess
there was no competition for him uh if

6032
01:43:09,770 --> 01:43:09,780
there was no competition for him uh if
 

6033
01:43:09,780 --> 01:43:11,030
there was no competition for him uh if
you think about like Magnus talking

6034
01:43:11,030 --> 01:43:11,040
you think about like Magnus talking
 

6035
01:43:11,040 --> 01:43:12,530
you think about like Magnus talking
about the world championship and feeling

6036
01:43:12,530 --> 01:43:12,540
about the world championship and feeling
 

6037
01:43:12,540 --> 01:43:14,450
about the world championship and feeling
like it's not competitive enough for

6038
01:43:14,450 --> 01:43:14,460
like it's not competitive enough for
 

6039
01:43:14,460 --> 01:43:16,490
like it's not competitive enough for
morphe there was no one who could even

6040
01:43:16,490 --> 01:43:16,500
morphe there was no one who could even
 

6041
01:43:16,500 --> 01:43:19,430
morphe there was no one who could even
beat him probably in individual games so

6042
01:43:19,430 --> 01:43:19,440
beat him probably in individual games so
 

6043
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:21,169
beat him probably in individual games so
he ended up quitting chess I think he

6044
01:43:21,169 --> 01:43:21,179
he ended up quitting chess I think he
 

6045
01:43:21,179 --> 01:43:23,750
he ended up quitting chess I think he
was sort of like a lawyer kind of but he

6046
01:43:23,750 --> 01:43:23,760
was sort of like a lawyer kind of but he
 

6047
01:43:23,760 --> 01:43:25,729
was sort of like a lawyer kind of but he
spent probably the last 15 I think last

6048
01:43:25,729 --> 01:43:25,739
spent probably the last 15 I think last
 

6049
01:43:25,739 --> 01:43:27,530
spent probably the last 15 I think last
15 20 years of his life just doing

6050
01:43:27,530 --> 01:43:27,540
15 20 years of his life just doing
 

6051
01:43:27,540 --> 01:43:29,570
15 20 years of his life just doing
nothing now I have actually seen his

6052
01:43:29,570 --> 01:43:29,580
nothing now I have actually seen his
 

6053
01:43:29,580 --> 01:43:31,129
nothing now I have actually seen his
grave in New Orleans I have been to

6054
01:43:31,129 --> 01:43:31,139
grave in New Orleans I have been to
 

6055
01:43:31,139 --> 01:43:32,870
grave in New Orleans I have been to
where where he lived I think it's now

6056
01:43:32,870 --> 01:43:32,880
where where he lived I think it's now
 

6057
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:34,310
where where he lived I think it's now
Brennan's if I'm not mistaken or

6058
01:43:34,310 --> 01:43:34,320
Brennan's if I'm not mistaken or
 

6059
01:43:34,320 --> 01:43:36,109
Brennan's if I'm not mistaken or
something like that

6060
01:43:36,109 --> 01:43:36,119
something like that
 

6061
01:43:36,119 --> 01:43:37,970
something like that
um so it's very tragic that there was no

6062
01:43:37,970 --> 01:43:37,980
um so it's very tragic that there was no
 

6063
01:43:37,980 --> 01:43:39,590
um so it's very tragic that there was no
one who was competitive with him at the

6064
01:43:39,590 --> 01:43:39,600
one who was competitive with him at the
 

6065
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:40,430
one who was competitive with him at the
time

6066
01:43:40,430 --> 01:43:40,440
time
 

6067
01:43:40,440 --> 01:43:42,830
time
um as far as best ever I don't I don't

6068
01:43:42,830 --> 01:43:42,840
um as far as best ever I don't I don't
 

6069
01:43:42,840 --> 01:43:45,470
um as far as best ever I don't I don't
think you can say he's the goat but I

6070
01:43:45,470 --> 01:43:45,480
think you can say he's the goat but I
 

6071
01:43:45,480 --> 01:43:47,450
think you can say he's the goat but I
still think he's in the top 10 if we're

6072
01:43:47,450 --> 01:43:47,460
still think he's in the top 10 if we're
 

6073
01:43:47,460 --> 01:43:49,189
still think he's in the top 10 if we're
using a criteria of players who were

6074
01:43:49,189 --> 01:43:49,199
using a criteria of players who were
 

6075
01:43:49,199 --> 01:43:51,290
using a criteria of players who were
better than their peers by a big big

6076
01:43:51,290 --> 01:43:51,300
better than their peers by a big big
 

6077
01:43:51,300 --> 01:43:52,430
better than their peers by a big big
margin

6078
01:43:52,430 --> 01:43:52,440
margin
 

6079
01:43:52,440 --> 01:43:54,169
margin
so what do you think about the world

6080
01:43:54,169 --> 01:43:54,179
so what do you think about the world
 

6081
01:43:54,179 --> 01:43:56,030
so what do you think about the world
championship and what do you think about

6082
01:43:56,030 --> 01:43:56,040
championship and what do you think about
 

6083
01:43:56,040 --> 01:43:58,790
championship and what do you think about
Magnus stepping down do you still see it

6084
01:43:58,790 --> 01:43:58,800
Magnus stepping down do you still see it
 

6085
01:43:58,800 --> 01:44:00,590
Magnus stepping down do you still see it
as the height of chess

6086
01:44:00,590 --> 01:44:00,600
as the height of chess
 

6087
01:44:00,600 --> 01:44:03,950
as the height of chess
I I still think that there is Merit in

6088
01:44:03,950 --> 01:44:03,960
I I still think that there is Merit in
 

6089
01:44:03,960 --> 01:44:05,510
I I still think that there is Merit in
having the world championship the way it

6090
01:44:05,510 --> 01:44:05,520
having the world championship the way it
 

6091
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:07,430
having the world championship the way it
is at the same time the game is always

6092
01:44:07,430 --> 01:44:07,440
is at the same time the game is always
 

6093
01:44:07,440 --> 01:44:09,470
is at the same time the game is always
evolving and one of the things that has

6094
01:44:09,470 --> 01:44:09,480
evolving and one of the things that has
 

6095
01:44:09,480 --> 01:44:11,390
evolving and one of the things that has
changed a lot in recent times is you now

6096
01:44:11,390 --> 01:44:11,400
changed a lot in recent times is you now
 

6097
01:44:11,400 --> 01:44:13,550
changed a lot in recent times is you now
have a lot more Blitz tournaments and

6098
01:44:13,550 --> 01:44:13,560
have a lot more Blitz tournaments and
 

6099
01:44:13,560 --> 01:44:15,530
have a lot more Blitz tournaments and
also rapid tournaments in the past

6100
01:44:15,530 --> 01:44:15,540
also rapid tournaments in the past
 

6101
01:44:15,540 --> 01:44:17,330
also rapid tournaments in the past
classical chess was the golden standard

6102
01:44:17,330 --> 01:44:17,340
classical chess was the golden standard
 

6103
01:44:17,340 --> 01:44:18,590
classical chess was the golden standard
there were that was the only thing that

6104
01:44:18,590 --> 01:44:18,600
there were that was the only thing that
 

6105
01:44:18,600 --> 01:44:20,570
there were that was the only thing that
mattered but in the last probably 10

6106
01:44:20,570 --> 01:44:20,580
mattered but in the last probably 10
 

6107
01:44:20,580 --> 01:44:22,910
mattered but in the last probably 10
years slowly but surely there are

6108
01:44:22,910 --> 01:44:22,920
years slowly but surely there are
 

6109
01:44:22,920 --> 01:44:24,950
years slowly but surely there are
probably as many rapid flash Blitz

6110
01:44:24,950 --> 01:44:24,960
probably as many rapid flash Blitz
 

6111
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:26,030
probably as many rapid flash Blitz
tournaments as there are classical

6112
01:44:26,030 --> 01:44:26,040
tournaments as there are classical
 

6113
01:44:26,040 --> 01:44:28,129
tournaments as there are classical
tournaments now maybe it's not quite 50

6114
01:44:28,129 --> 01:44:28,139
tournaments now maybe it's not quite 50
 

6115
01:44:28,139 --> 01:44:30,169
tournaments now maybe it's not quite 50
50 but at the top level at least it

6116
01:44:30,169 --> 01:44:30,179
50 but at the top level at least it
 

6117
01:44:30,179 --> 01:44:31,729
50 but at the top level at least it
feels like it's getting very close to 50

6118
01:44:31,729 --> 01:44:31,739
feels like it's getting very close to 50
 

6119
01:44:31,739 --> 01:44:34,430
feels like it's getting very close to 50
50. and in terms of the world

6120
01:44:34,430 --> 01:44:34,440
50. and in terms of the world
 

6121
01:44:34,440 --> 01:44:36,649
50. and in terms of the world
championship I feel that the biggest

6122
01:44:36,649 --> 01:44:36,659
championship I feel that the biggest
 

6123
01:44:36,659 --> 01:44:38,570
championship I feel that the biggest
issue is you have too many draws the

6124
01:44:38,570 --> 01:44:38,580
issue is you have too many draws the
 

6125
01:44:38,580 --> 01:44:40,070
issue is you have too many draws the
games can be exciting but the games

6126
01:44:40,070 --> 01:44:40,080
games can be exciting but the games
 

6127
01:44:40,080 --> 01:44:42,590
games can be exciting but the games
inevitably end in a draw and the single

6128
01:44:42,590 --> 01:44:42,600
inevitably end in a draw and the single
 

6129
01:44:42,600 --> 01:44:44,209
inevitably end in a draw and the single
biggest reason is because players have

6130
01:44:44,209 --> 01:44:44,219
biggest reason is because players have
 

6131
01:44:44,219 --> 01:44:46,189
biggest reason is because players have
about six months or more to prepare for

6132
01:44:46,189 --> 01:44:46,199
about six months or more to prepare for
 

6133
01:44:46,199 --> 01:44:48,050
about six months or more to prepare for
the match so for example the Canada's

6134
01:44:48,050 --> 01:44:48,060
the match so for example the Canada's
 

6135
01:44:48,060 --> 01:44:49,790
the match so for example the Canada's
tournament which I just played it was in

6136
01:44:49,790 --> 01:44:49,800
tournament which I just played it was in
 

6137
01:44:49,800 --> 01:44:51,410
tournament which I just played it was in
June and July it ended I think around

6138
01:44:51,410 --> 01:44:51,420
June and July it ended I think around
 

6139
01:44:51,420 --> 01:44:53,270
June and July it ended I think around
July 5th the world championship match

6140
01:44:53,270 --> 01:44:53,280
July 5th the world championship match
 

6141
01:44:53,280 --> 01:44:55,010
July 5th the world championship match
will probably be in February of March so

6142
01:44:55,010 --> 01:44:55,020
will probably be in February of March so
 

6143
01:44:55,020 --> 01:44:57,109
will probably be in February of March so
that's you know nine months and when

6144
01:44:57,109 --> 01:44:57,119
that's you know nine months and when
 

6145
01:44:57,119 --> 01:44:58,609
that's you know nine months and when
players have that much time to prepare

6146
01:44:58,609 --> 01:44:58,619
players have that much time to prepare
 

6147
01:44:58,619 --> 01:45:00,229
players have that much time to prepare
they are not going to have any

6148
01:45:00,229 --> 01:45:00,239
they are not going to have any
 

6149
01:45:00,239 --> 01:45:01,910
they are not going to have any
weaknesses in the opening phase of the

6150
01:45:01,910 --> 01:45:01,920
weaknesses in the opening phase of the
 

6151
01:45:01,920 --> 01:45:03,770
weaknesses in the opening phase of the
game and so both players are likely

6152
01:45:03,770 --> 01:45:03,780
game and so both players are likely
 

6153
01:45:03,780 --> 01:45:05,390
game and so both players are likely
going to be very solid you'll have a lot

6154
01:45:05,390 --> 01:45:05,400
going to be very solid you'll have a lot
 

6155
01:45:05,400 --> 01:45:07,550
going to be very solid you'll have a lot
of draws and in many cases it might come

6156
01:45:07,550 --> 01:45:07,560
of draws and in many cases it might come
 

6157
01:45:07,560 --> 01:45:09,830
of draws and in many cases it might come
down to tie breaks Magnus in fact in two

6158
01:45:09,830 --> 01:45:09,840
down to tie breaks Magnus in fact in two
 

6159
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:11,870
down to tie breaks Magnus in fact in two
of the matches both against karyakan and

6160
01:45:11,870 --> 01:45:11,880
of the matches both against karyakan and
 

6161
01:45:11,880 --> 01:45:14,090
of the matches both against karyakan and
against Carolina he had to win in Rapid

6162
01:45:14,090 --> 01:45:14,100
against Carolina he had to win in Rapid
 

6163
01:45:14,100 --> 01:45:16,490
against Carolina he had to win in Rapid
tie breaks so I think for Magnus he just

6164
01:45:16,490 --> 01:45:16,500
tie breaks so I think for Magnus he just
 

6165
01:45:16,500 --> 01:45:18,229
tie breaks so I think for Magnus he just
doesn't feel like the format is right I

6166
01:45:18,229 --> 01:45:18,239
doesn't feel like the format is right I
 

6167
01:45:18,239 --> 01:45:19,850
doesn't feel like the format is right I
think he feels that there's just it's

6168
01:45:19,850 --> 01:45:19,860
think he feels that there's just it's
 

6169
01:45:19,860 --> 01:45:22,430
think he feels that there's just it's
too long too many draws he doesn't get

6170
01:45:22,430 --> 01:45:22,440
too long too many draws he doesn't get
 

6171
01:45:22,440 --> 01:45:24,050
too long too many draws he doesn't get
to play Creative or exciting chess and

6172
01:45:24,050 --> 01:45:24,060
to play Creative or exciting chess and
 

6173
01:45:24,060 --> 01:45:25,550
to play Creative or exciting chess and
that's why I think he pushed so hard for

6174
01:45:25,550 --> 01:45:25,560
that's why I think he pushed so hard for
 

6175
01:45:25,560 --> 01:45:28,129
that's why I think he pushed so hard for
a change in the format I don't know what

6176
01:45:28,129 --> 01:45:28,139
a change in the format I don't know what
 

6177
01:45:28,139 --> 01:45:30,530
a change in the format I don't know what
the right change would be but I do think

6178
01:45:30,530 --> 01:45:30,540
the right change would be but I do think
 

6179
01:45:30,540 --> 01:45:32,629
the right change would be but I do think
that the format is becoming a little bit

6180
01:45:32,629 --> 01:45:32,639
that the format is becoming a little bit
 

6181
01:45:32,639 --> 01:45:34,310
that the format is becoming a little bit
antiquated with all these classical

6182
01:45:34,310 --> 01:45:34,320
antiquated with all these classical
 

6183
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:36,770
antiquated with all these classical
games if you don't want to change the

6184
01:45:36,770 --> 01:45:36,780
games if you don't want to change the
 

6185
01:45:36,780 --> 01:45:38,149
games if you don't want to change the
format the one suggestion that I've

6186
01:45:38,149 --> 01:45:38,159
format the one suggestion that I've
 

6187
01:45:38,159 --> 01:45:39,350
format the one suggestion that I've
mentioned before and I think it's

6188
01:45:39,350 --> 01:45:39,360
mentioned before and I think it's
 

6189
01:45:39,360 --> 01:45:41,689
mentioned before and I think it's
probably still valid is that the match

6190
01:45:41,689 --> 01:45:41,699
probably still valid is that the match
 

6191
01:45:41,699 --> 01:45:43,430
probably still valid is that the match
should be held maybe one month after the

6192
01:45:43,430 --> 01:45:43,440
should be held maybe one month after the
 

6193
01:45:43,440 --> 01:45:44,810
should be held maybe one month after the
Canada's tournament to determine the

6194
01:45:44,810 --> 01:45:44,820
Canada's tournament to determine the
 

6195
01:45:44,820 --> 01:45:46,550
Canada's tournament to determine the
Challenger it's held one month after

6196
01:45:46,550 --> 01:45:46,560
Challenger it's held one month after
 

6197
01:45:46,560 --> 01:45:49,189
Challenger it's held one month after
that event that's probably this the only

6198
01:45:49,189 --> 01:45:49,199
that event that's probably this the only
 

6199
01:45:49,199 --> 01:45:51,649
that event that's probably this the only
way to keep the format as it is where I

6200
01:45:51,649 --> 01:45:51,659
way to keep the format as it is where I
 

6201
01:45:51,659 --> 01:45:53,030
way to keep the format as it is where I
think both players have time to repair

6202
01:45:53,030 --> 01:45:53,040
think both players have time to repair
 

6203
01:45:53,040 --> 01:45:54,709
think both players have time to repair
but it's not something crazy because

6204
01:45:54,709 --> 01:45:54,719
but it's not something crazy because
 

6205
01:45:54,719 --> 01:45:56,870
but it's not something crazy because
when you compare the candidates to other

6206
01:45:56,870 --> 01:45:56,880
when you compare the candidates to other
 

6207
01:45:56,880 --> 01:45:59,030
when you compare the candidates to other
classical tournaments let's just say

6208
01:45:59,030 --> 01:45:59,040
classical tournaments let's just say
 

6209
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:01,189
classical tournaments let's just say
let's just say St Louis I played I

6210
01:46:01,189 --> 01:46:01,199
let's just say St Louis I played I
 

6211
01:46:01,199 --> 01:46:02,750
let's just say St Louis I played I
played there recently there was the I

6212
01:46:02,750 --> 01:46:02,760
played there recently there was the I
 

6213
01:46:02,760 --> 01:46:04,010
played there recently there was the I
played the rapping Blitz but there was a

6214
01:46:04,010 --> 01:46:04,020
played the rapping Blitz but there was a
 

6215
01:46:04,020 --> 01:46:05,149
played the rapping Blitz but there was a
singfield cup

6216
01:46:05,149 --> 01:46:05,159
singfield cup
 

6217
01:46:05,159 --> 01:46:07,729
singfield cup
um this was I think like September 10th

6218
01:46:07,729 --> 01:46:07,739
um this was I think like September 10th
 

6219
01:46:07,739 --> 01:46:09,770
um this was I think like September 10th
something like that the point is players

6220
01:46:09,770 --> 01:46:09,780
something like that the point is players
 

6221
01:46:09,780 --> 01:46:11,450
something like that the point is players
probably came in and had a week or two

6222
01:46:11,450 --> 01:46:11,460
probably came in and had a week or two
 

6223
01:46:11,460 --> 01:46:13,070
probably came in and had a week or two
to prepare for that tournament now

6224
01:46:13,070 --> 01:46:13,080
to prepare for that tournament now
 

6225
01:46:13,080 --> 01:46:14,450
to prepare for that tournament now
there's the US Championship players had

6226
01:46:14,450 --> 01:46:14,460
there's the US Championship players had
 

6227
01:46:14,460 --> 01:46:15,950
there's the US Championship players had
a little bit of time to repair you play

6228
01:46:15,950 --> 01:46:15,960
a little bit of time to repair you play
 

6229
01:46:15,960 --> 01:46:17,810
a little bit of time to repair you play
the event normally players don't have

6230
01:46:17,810 --> 01:46:17,820
the event normally players don't have
 

6231
01:46:17,820 --> 01:46:19,790
the event normally players don't have
these long breaks where they can prepare

6232
01:46:19,790 --> 01:46:19,800
these long breaks where they can prepare
 

6233
01:46:19,800 --> 01:46:21,709
these long breaks where they can prepare
for very long periods of time so they

6234
01:46:21,709 --> 01:46:21,719
for very long periods of time so they
 

6235
01:46:21,719 --> 01:46:23,450
for very long periods of time so they
are very well prepared but you still

6236
01:46:23,450 --> 01:46:23,460
are very well prepared but you still
 

6237
01:46:23,460 --> 01:46:24,709
are very well prepared but you still
have a lot of exciting games because

6238
01:46:24,709 --> 01:46:24,719
have a lot of exciting games because
 

6239
01:46:24,719 --> 01:46:26,330
have a lot of exciting games because
that window of preparation is so much

6240
01:46:26,330 --> 01:46:26,340
that window of preparation is so much
 

6241
01:46:26,340 --> 01:46:29,030
that window of preparation is so much
smaller but you had uh you're pretty

6242
01:46:29,030 --> 01:46:29,040
smaller but you had uh you're pretty
 

6243
01:46:29,040 --> 01:46:31,669
smaller but you had uh you're pretty
close given how things rolled out to

6244
01:46:31,669 --> 01:46:31,679
close given how things rolled out to
 

6245
01:46:31,679 --> 01:46:35,030
close given how things rolled out to
heaven having the opportunity to compete

6246
01:46:35,030 --> 01:46:35,040
heaven having the opportunity to compete
 

6247
01:46:35,040 --> 01:46:37,550
heaven having the opportunity to compete
for the World Championship uh hence the

6248
01:46:37,550 --> 01:46:37,560
for the World Championship uh hence the
 

6249
01:46:37,560 --> 01:46:39,470
for the World Championship uh hence the
the copia meme which I still don't quite

6250
01:46:39,470 --> 01:46:39,480
the copia meme which I still don't quite
 

6251
01:46:39,480 --> 01:46:41,149
the copia meme which I still don't quite
understand

6252
01:46:41,149 --> 01:46:41,159
understand
 

6253
01:46:41,159 --> 01:46:41,870
understand
um

6254
01:46:41,870 --> 01:46:41,880
um
 

6255
01:46:41,880 --> 01:46:45,590
um
are you and Magnus friends enemies

6256
01:46:45,590 --> 01:46:45,600
are you and Magnus friends enemies
 

6257
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:47,870
are you and Magnus friends enemies
Frenemies

6258
01:46:47,870 --> 01:46:47,880
Frenemies
 

6259
01:46:47,880 --> 01:46:49,910
Frenemies
um what what's the status of the

6260
01:46:49,910 --> 01:46:49,920
um what what's the status of the
 

6261
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:52,189
um what what's the status of the
relationship yeah I think with all the

6262
01:46:52,189 --> 01:46:52,199
relationship yeah I think with all the
 

6263
01:46:52,199 --> 01:46:55,010
relationship yeah I think with all the
rivalries in chess everybody tries to

6264
01:46:55,010 --> 01:46:55,020
rivalries in chess everybody tries to
 

6265
01:46:55,020 --> 01:46:56,510
rivalries in chess everybody tries to
Hype it up like everyone hates each

6266
01:46:56,510 --> 01:46:56,520
Hype it up like everyone hates each
 

6267
01:46:56,520 --> 01:46:58,310
Hype it up like everyone hates each
other but the thing is at the end of the

6268
01:46:58,310 --> 01:46:58,320
other but the thing is at the end of the
 

6269
01:46:58,320 --> 01:47:00,229
other but the thing is at the end of the
day yes we're very competitive we want

6270
01:47:00,229 --> 01:47:00,239
day yes we're very competitive we want
 

6271
01:47:00,239 --> 01:47:01,430
day yes we're very competitive we want
to beat each other whether it's myself

6272
01:47:01,430 --> 01:47:01,440
to beat each other whether it's myself
 

6273
01:47:01,440 --> 01:47:04,490
to beat each other whether it's myself
or Magnus or other other top players but

6274
01:47:04,490 --> 01:47:04,500
or Magnus or other other top players but
 

6275
01:47:04,500 --> 01:47:06,050
or Magnus or other other top players but
we also realize that it's a very small

6276
01:47:06,050 --> 01:47:06,060
we also realize that it's a very small
 

6277
01:47:06,060 --> 01:47:07,970
we also realize that it's a very small
world like a lot of us are able to make

6278
01:47:07,970 --> 01:47:07,980
world like a lot of us are able to make
 

6279
01:47:07,980 --> 01:47:09,050
world like a lot of us are able to make
a living playing the game as

6280
01:47:09,050 --> 01:47:09,060
a living playing the game as
 

6281
01:47:09,060 --> 01:47:11,149
a living playing the game as
professionals and as I alluded to

6282
01:47:11,149 --> 01:47:11,159
professionals and as I alluded to
 

6283
01:47:11,159 --> 01:47:13,550
professionals and as I alluded to
earlier the top 20 to 30 players can

6284
01:47:13,550 --> 01:47:13,560
earlier the top 20 to 30 players can
 

6285
01:47:13,560 --> 01:47:14,930
earlier the top 20 to 30 players can
make a living so even though we're

6286
01:47:14,930 --> 01:47:14,940
make a living so even though we're
 

6287
01:47:14,940 --> 01:47:16,250
make a living so even though we're
competitive against each other we want

6288
01:47:16,250 --> 01:47:16,260
competitive against each other we want
 

6289
01:47:16,260 --> 01:47:17,990
competitive against each other we want
to beat each other there is a certain

6290
01:47:17,990 --> 01:47:18,000
to beat each other there is a certain
 

6291
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:19,790
to beat each other there is a certain
level of respect that we have and there

6292
01:47:19,790 --> 01:47:19,800
level of respect that we have and there
 

6293
01:47:19,800 --> 01:47:22,250
level of respect that we have and there
is a sort of Brotherhood I would say

6294
01:47:22,250 --> 01:47:22,260
is a sort of Brotherhood I would say
 

6295
01:47:22,260 --> 01:47:23,930
is a sort of Brotherhood I would say
um so all of us are I would say

6296
01:47:23,930 --> 01:47:23,940
um so all of us are I would say
 

6297
01:47:23,940 --> 01:47:25,370
um so all of us are I would say
Frenemies I think that's the simplest

6298
01:47:25,370 --> 01:47:25,380
Frenemies I think that's the simplest
 

6299
01:47:25,380 --> 01:47:28,070
Frenemies I think that's the simplest
way of putting it what do you love most

6300
01:47:28,070 --> 01:47:28,080
way of putting it what do you love most
 

6301
01:47:28,080 --> 01:47:31,729
way of putting it what do you love most
about Magnus Carlson as a human being as

6302
01:47:31,729 --> 01:47:31,739
about Magnus Carlson as a human being as
 

6303
01:47:31,739 --> 01:47:33,770
about Magnus Carlson as a human being as
a human being I think it's it's very

6304
01:47:33,770 --> 01:47:33,780
a human being I think it's it's very
 

6305
01:47:33,780 --> 01:47:36,050
a human being I think it's it's very
similar actually to use a comparison to

6306
01:47:36,050 --> 01:47:36,060
similar actually to use a comparison to
 

6307
01:47:36,060 --> 01:47:38,209
similar actually to use a comparison to
tennis and Roger Federer in that it

6308
01:47:38,209 --> 01:47:38,219
tennis and Roger Federer in that it
 

6309
01:47:38,219 --> 01:47:40,070
tennis and Roger Federer in that it
feels like with Magnus everything comes

6310
01:47:40,070 --> 01:47:40,080
feels like with Magnus everything comes
 

6311
01:47:40,080 --> 01:47:42,169
feels like with Magnus everything comes
very easily it's for example we've seen

6312
01:47:42,169 --> 01:47:42,179
very easily it's for example we've seen
 

6313
01:47:42,179 --> 01:47:43,910
very easily it's for example we've seen
the situation with Han's name somehow

6314
01:47:43,910 --> 01:47:43,920
the situation with Han's name somehow
 

6315
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:45,350
the situation with Han's name somehow
it's rolled right off his back and he's

6316
01:47:45,350 --> 01:47:45,360
it's rolled right off his back and he's
 

6317
01:47:45,360 --> 01:47:47,149
it's rolled right off his back and he's
playing Amazing chess in this in his

6318
01:47:47,149 --> 01:47:47,159
playing Amazing chess in this in his

felt that I think actually for me it's
 

6509
01:51:10,920 --> 01:51:12,830
felt that I think actually for me it's
very eye-opening to realize how

6510
01:51:12,830 --> 01:51:12,840
very eye-opening to realize how
 

6511
01:51:12,840 --> 01:51:14,390
very eye-opening to realize how
difficult it is for a lot of the Russian

6512
01:51:14,390 --> 01:51:14,400
difficult it is for a lot of the Russian
 

6513
01:51:14,400 --> 01:51:16,550
difficult it is for a lot of the Russian
chess players right now to play because

6514
01:51:16,550 --> 01:51:16,560
chess players right now to play because
 

6515
01:51:16,560 --> 01:51:18,709
chess players right now to play because
of the situation even nepo for that

6516
01:51:18,709 --> 01:51:18,719
of the situation even nepo for that
 

6517
01:51:18,719 --> 01:51:20,510
of the situation even nepo for that
matter I remember when we were in St

6518
01:51:20,510 --> 01:51:20,520
matter I remember when we were in St
 

6519
01:51:20,520 --> 01:51:22,490

Louis he he essentially has to bring

6520
01:51:22,490 --> 01:51:22,500
Louis he he essentially has to bring
 

6521
01:51:22,500 --> 01:51:24,530
Louis he he essentially has to bring
cash because obviously Russia's cut off

6522
01:51:24,530 --> 01:51:24,540
cash because obviously Russia's cut off
 

6523
01:51:24,540 --> 01:51:27,229
cash because obviously Russia's cut off
from Swift no no credit cards work so if

6524
01:51:27,229 --> 01:51:27,239
from Swift no no credit cards work so if
 

6525
01:51:27,239 --> 01:51:28,669
from Swift no no credit cards work so if
these Russians don't have cash they

6526
01:51:28,669 --> 01:51:28,679
these Russians don't have cash they
 

6527
01:51:28,679 --> 01:51:30,109
these Russians don't have cash they
can't play and I know a lot of them have

6528

very very very tough situation for them
 

6535
01:51:37,020 --> 01:51:38,510
very very very tough situation for them
obviously for the ukrainians who are

6536
01:51:38,510 --> 01:51:38,520
obviously for the ukrainians who are
 

6537
01:51:38,520 --> 01:51:39,530
obviously for the ukrainians who are
suffering

6538
01:51:39,530 --> 01:51:39,540
suffering
 

6539
01:51:39,540 --> 01:51:41,870
suffering
um it's it's really really bad do you

6540
01:51:41,870 --> 01:51:41,880
um it's it's really really bad do you
 

6541

um it's it's really really bad do you
know if nepo this has he talked haven't

6542
01:51:44,209 --> 01:51:44,219
know if nepo this has he talked haven't
 

6543
01:51:44,219 --> 01:51:46,390
know if nepo this has he talked haven't
seen as he talked about

6544
01:51:46,390 --> 01:51:46,400
seen as he talked about
 

6545
01:51:46,400 --> 01:51:49,609
seen as he talked about
the politics the the geopolitics of it

6546
01:51:49,609 --> 01:51:49,619
the politics the the geopolitics of it
 

6547
01:51:49,619 --> 01:51:52,010
the politics the the geopolitics of it
all I I don't think he really has I I

6548
01:51:52,010 --> 01:51:52,020
all I I don't think he really has I I
 

6549
01:51:52,020 --> 01:51:54,590
all I I don't think he really has I I
mean I I feel like most players try to

6550
01:51:54,590 --> 01:51:54,600
mean I I feel like most players try to
 

6551
01:51:54,600 --> 01:51:56,390
mean I I feel like most players try to
avoid talking about I think it's very

6552
01:51:56,390 --> 01:51:56,400
avoid talking about I think it's very
 

6553
01:51:56,400 --> 01:51:58,250
avoid talking about I think it's very
difficult I remember when I was in St

6554
01:51:58,250 --> 01:51:58,260
difficult I remember when I was in St
 

6555
01:51:58,260 --> 01:51:59,450
difficult I remember when I was in St
Louis there's another Russian player

6556
01:51:59,450 --> 01:51:59,460
Louis there's another Russian player
 

6557
01:51:59,460 --> 01:52:01,550
Louis there's another Russian player
Peter savidler and I I basically asked

6558
01:52:01,550 --> 01:52:01,560
Peter savidler and I I basically asked
 

6559
01:52:01,560 --> 01:52:02,990
Peter savidler and I I basically asked
him he's like don't get me started

6560
01:52:02,990 --> 01:52:03,000
him he's like don't get me started
 

6561
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,149
him he's like don't get me started
because I I can't I just can't talk

6562
01:52:05,149 --> 01:52:05,159
because I I can't I just can't talk
 

6563
01:52:05,159 --> 01:52:08,390
because I I can't I just can't talk
about it um so I think most of them are

6564
01:52:08,390 --> 01:52:08,400
about it um so I think most of them are
 

6565
01:52:08,400 --> 01:52:09,649
about it um so I think most of them are
probably on the other side of the

6566
01:52:09,649 --> 01:52:09,659
probably on the other side of the
 

6567
01:52:09,659 --> 01:52:10,850
probably on the other side of the
spectrum I don't think they're probably

6568
01:52:10,850 --> 01:52:10,860
spectrum I don't think they're probably
 

6569
01:52:10,860 --> 01:52:13,609
spectrum I don't think they're probably
supportive of what is going on right now

6570
01:52:13,609 --> 01:52:13,619
supportive of what is going on right now
 

6571
01:52:13,619 --> 01:52:15,590
supportive of what is going on right now
so it's it's very it's a very very

6572
01:52:15,590 --> 01:52:15,600
so it's it's very it's a very very
 

6573
01:52:15,600 --> 01:52:18,169
so it's it's very it's a very very
difficult situation but I don't really

6574
01:52:18,169 --> 01:52:18,179
difficult situation but I don't really
 

6575
01:52:18,179 --> 01:52:20,570
difficult situation but I don't really
feel like that manifests itself in

6576
01:52:20,570 --> 01:52:20,580
feel like that manifests itself in
 

6577
01:52:20,580 --> 01:52:22,790
feel like that manifests itself in
actual like tensions when I play against

6578
01:52:22,790 --> 01:52:22,800
actual like tensions when I play against
 

6579
01:52:22,800 --> 01:52:24,649
actual like tensions when I play against
like the Russian players I mean maybe

6580
01:52:24,649 --> 01:52:24,659
like the Russian players I mean maybe
 

6581
01:52:24,659 --> 01:52:26,090
like the Russian players I mean maybe
when I was younger playing certain

6582
01:52:26,090 --> 01:52:26,100
when I was younger playing certain
 

6583
01:52:26,100 --> 01:52:27,950
when I was younger playing certain
events the the one country I felt like

6584
01:52:27,950 --> 01:52:27,960
events the the one country I felt like
 

6585
01:52:27,960 --> 01:52:29,990
events the the one country I felt like
maybe it actually I felt some tension I

6586
01:52:29,990 --> 01:52:30,000
maybe it actually I felt some tension I
 

6587
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:31,910
maybe it actually I felt some tension I
really want to go out of my way to win

6588
01:52:31,910 --> 01:52:31,920
really want to go out of my way to win

against was against the Chinese perhaps
 

6591
01:52:33,719 --> 01:52:35,330
against was against the Chinese perhaps
that is maybe the one time I felt

6592
01:52:35,330 --> 01:52:35,340
that is maybe the one time I felt
 

6593
01:52:35,340 --> 01:52:37,070
that is maybe the one time I felt
something along those lines

6594
01:52:37,070 --> 01:52:37,080
something along those lines
 

6595
01:52:37,080 --> 01:52:38,990
something along those lines
um but generally I feel like we treat

6596
01:52:38,990 --> 01:52:39,000
um but generally I feel like we treat
 

6597
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:40,609
um but generally I feel like we treat
the players as individuals it's not

6598
01:52:40,609 --> 01:52:40,619
the players as individuals it's not
 

6599
01:52:40,619 --> 01:52:43,310
the players as individuals it's not
about the country they represent yeah

6600
01:52:43,310 --> 01:52:43,320
about the country they represent yeah
 

6601
01:52:43,320 --> 01:52:46,070
about the country they represent yeah

nationalities all all different
 

6625
01:53:09,840 --> 01:53:12,890
nationalities all all different
backgrounds is is probably the thing

6626
01:53:12,890 --> 01:53:12,900
backgrounds is is probably the thing
 

6627
01:53:12,900 --> 01:53:16,010
backgrounds is is probably the thing
that I I really like the most chess is

6628
01:53:16,010 --> 01:53:16,020
that I I really like the most chess is
 

6629
01:53:16,020 --> 01:53:18,229
that I I really like the most chess is
one of the maybe the only thing I can

6630
01:53:18,229 --> 01:53:18,239
one of the maybe the only thing I can
 

6631
01:53:18,239 --> 01:53:19,790
one of the maybe the only thing I can
think of where you can have people

6632
01:53:19,790 --> 01:53:19,800
think of where you can have people
 

6633
01:53:19,800 --> 01:53:22,370
think of where you can have people
different backgrounds different ages

6634
01:53:22,370 --> 01:53:22,380
different backgrounds different ages
 

6635
01:53:22,380 --> 01:53:23,689
different backgrounds different ages
honestly you can have someone who's a

6636
01:53:23,689 --> 01:53:23,699
honestly you can have someone who's a
 

6637
01:53:23,699 --> 01:53:25,010
honestly you can have someone who's a
billionaire talking to someone who's

6638
01:53:25,010 --> 01:53:25,020
billionaire talking to someone who's
 

6639
01:53:25,020 --> 01:53:26,570
billionaire talking to someone who's
like a nine-year-old kid from the inner

6640
01:53:26,570 --> 01:53:26,580
like a nine-year-old kid from the inner
 

6641
01:53:26,580 --> 01:53:28,189
like a nine-year-old kid from the inner
city and when they're talking about the

6642
01:53:28,189 --> 01:53:28,199
city and when they're talking about the
 

6643
01:53:28,199 --> 01:53:29,990
city and when they're talking about the
game of chess they're on the same level

6644
01:53:29,990 --> 01:53:30,000
game of chess they're on the same level
 

6645
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:31,970
game of chess they're on the same level
and I don't think that is really

6646
01:53:31,970 --> 01:53:31,980
and I don't think that is really
 

6647
01:53:31,980 --> 01:53:33,890
and I don't think that is really
applicable to anything else in this

6648
01:53:33,890 --> 01:53:33,900
applicable to anything else in this
 

6649
01:53:33,900 --> 01:53:35,689
applicable to anything else in this
world um you don't have that level of

6650
01:53:35,689 --> 01:53:35,699
world um you don't have that level of
 

6651
01:53:35,699 --> 01:53:37,609
world um you don't have that level of
respect that is communicated through a

6652
01:53:37,609 --> 01:53:37,619
respect that is communicated through a
 

6653
01:53:37,619 --> 01:53:39,169
respect that is communicated through a
game so for me that's probably the

6654
01:53:39,169 --> 01:53:39,179
game so for me that's probably the
 

6655
01:53:39,179 --> 01:53:41,090
game so for me that's probably the
single most beautiful thing about about

6656
01:53:41,090 --> 01:53:41,100
single most beautiful thing about about
 

6657
01:53:41,100 --> 01:53:42,950
single most beautiful thing about about
sort of Chess in the Chess World itself

6658
01:53:42,950 --> 01:53:42,960
sort of Chess in the Chess World itself
 

6659
01:53:42,960 --> 01:53:45,290
sort of Chess in the Chess World itself
is that you have that in terms of the

6660
01:53:45,290 --> 01:53:45,300
is that you have that in terms of the
 

6661
01:53:45,300 --> 01:53:46,970
is that you have that in terms of the
game itself the creativity the

6662
01:53:46,970 --> 01:53:46,980
game itself the creativity the
 

6663
01:53:46,980 --> 01:53:48,950
game itself the creativity the
possibility of different positions

6664
01:53:48,950 --> 01:53:48,960
possibility of different positions
 

6665
01:53:48,960 --> 01:53:50,689
possibility of different positions
learning something new even after I've

6666
01:53:50,689 --> 01:53:50,699
learning something new even after I've
 

6667
01:53:50,699 --> 01:53:52,669
learning something new even after I've
played the game for 30 years is it's

6668
01:53:52,669 --> 01:53:52,679
played the game for 30 years is it's
 

6669
01:53:52,679 --> 01:53:54,770
played the game for 30 years is it's
very inspiring to me knowing that I've

6670
01:53:54,770 --> 01:53:54,780
very inspiring to me knowing that I've
 

6671

01:53:56,330 --> 01:53:56,340
spent all this time they're still new
 

6673
01:53:56,340 --> 01:53:57,770
spent all this time they're still new

things that I can learn
 

6675
01:53:57,780 --> 01:53:59,390
things that I can learn
um those those are probably two biggest

6676
01:53:59,390 --> 01:53:59,400
um those those are probably two biggest
 

6677
01:53:59,400 --> 01:54:02,209
um those those are probably two biggest
biggest things that I would refer to are

6678
01:54:02,209 --> 01:54:02,219
biggest things that I would refer to are
 

6679
01:54:02,219 --> 01:54:02,990
biggest things that I would refer to are
there

6680
01:54:02,990 --> 01:54:03,000
there
 

6681
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,570
there
memories big or small like weird

6682
01:54:05,570 --> 01:54:05,580
memories big or small like weird
 

6683
01:54:05,580 --> 01:54:07,189
memories big or small like weird
surprising anecdotes from all those

6684
01:54:07,189 --> 01:54:07,199
surprising anecdotes from all those
 

6685
01:54:07,199 --> 01:54:08,810
surprising anecdotes from all those
years of going to all the different

01:54:08,810 --> 01:54:08,820
years of going to all the different
 

6687
01:54:08,820 --> 01:54:11,450
years of going to all the different
places that stand out to some some of

6688
01:54:11,450 --> 01:54:11,460
places that stand out to some some of
 

6689
01:54:11,460 --> 01:54:14,750
places that stand out to some some of
the darker times weirder times like

6690
01:54:14,750 --> 01:54:14,760
the darker times weirder times like
 

6691
01:54:14,760 --> 01:54:16,490
the darker times weirder times like
weird places you've played weird people

6692
01:54:16,490 --> 01:54:16,500
weird places you've played weird people
 

6693
01:54:16,500 --> 01:54:18,109
weird places you've played weird people
you played weird people you hung out

6694
01:54:18,109 --> 01:54:18,119
you played weird people you hung out
 

6695
01:54:18,119 --> 01:54:20,750
you played weird people you hung out
with anything that jumps to memory you

6696
01:54:20,750 --> 01:54:20,760
with anything that jumps to memory you
 

6697
01:54:20,760 --> 01:54:23,090
with anything that jumps to memory you
know I think we're this is probably a

6698
01:54:23,090 --> 01:54:23,100
know I think we're this is probably a
 

6699
01:54:23,100 --> 01:54:24,770
know I think we're this is probably a
little bit more like political but I

6700
01:54:24,770 --> 01:54:24,780
little bit more like political but I
 

6701
01:54:24,780 --> 01:54:26,030
little bit more like political but I
think one of the things that's great is

6702
01:54:26,030 --> 01:54:26,040
think one of the things that's great is
 

6703
01:54:26,040 --> 01:54:27,290
think one of the things that's great is
whenever you go and play these

6704
01:54:27,290 --> 01:54:27,300
whenever you go and play these
 

6705
01:54:27,300 --> 01:54:28,250
whenever you go and play these
tournaments you have a certain

6706
01:54:28,250 --> 01:54:28,260
tournaments you have a certain
 

6707
01:54:28,260 --> 01:54:30,649
tournaments you have a certain
impression of what a country is like or

6708
01:54:30,649 --> 01:54:30,659
impression of what a country is like or
 

6709
01:54:30,659 --> 01:54:32,689
impression of what a country is like or
what the people are like and probably

6710
01:54:32,689 --> 01:54:32,699
what the people are like and probably
 

6711
01:54:32,699 --> 01:54:35,570
what the people are like and probably
the best example for me was in 2004 or

6712
01:54:35,570 --> 01:54:35,580
the best example for me was in 2004 or
 

6713
01:54:35,580 --> 01:54:37,189
the best example for me was in 2004 or
it's actually no sorry it's 2003 I think

6714
01:54:37,189 --> 01:54:37,199
it's actually no sorry it's 2003 I think
 

6715
01:54:37,199 --> 01:54:39,470
it's actually no sorry it's 2003 I think
it was I played in the uh fide World Cup

6716
01:54:39,470 --> 01:54:39,480
it was I played in the uh fide World Cup
 

6717
01:54:39,480 --> 01:54:41,270
it was I played in the uh fide World Cup
and it was held in Tripoli the capital

6718
01:54:41,270 --> 01:54:41,280
and it was held in Tripoli the capital
 

6719
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:43,010
and it was held in Tripoli the capital
of Libya at the time when Gaddafi was

6720
01:54:43,010 --> 01:54:43,020
of Libya at the time when Gaddafi was
 

6721
01:54:43,020 --> 01:54:44,990
of Libya at the time when Gaddafi was
still running the country and you know

6722
01:54:44,990 --> 01:54:45,000
still running the country and you know
 

6723
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:46,430
still running the country and you know
you hear a lot of these things but then

6724
01:54:46,430 --> 01:54:46,440
you hear a lot of these things but then
 

6725
01:54:46,440 --> 01:54:47,930
you hear a lot of these things but then
when you go there and you see the people

6726
01:54:47,930 --> 01:54:47,940
when you go there and you see the people
 

6727
01:54:47,940 --> 01:54:50,330
when you go there and you see the people
are so friendly it's very eye-opening

6728
01:54:50,330 --> 01:54:50,340
are so friendly it's very eye-opening
 

6729
01:54:50,340 --> 01:54:52,310
are so friendly it's very eye-opening
and sort of you you look at it with uh

6730
01:54:52,310 --> 01:54:52,320
and sort of you you look at it with uh
 

6731
01:54:52,320 --> 01:54:54,830
and sort of you you look at it with uh
without just believing things you go to

6732
01:54:54,830 --> 01:54:54,840
without just believing things you go to
 

6733
01:54:54,840 --> 01:54:56,390
without just believing things you go to
these places you see how things truly

6734
01:54:56,390 --> 01:54:56,400
these places you see how things truly
 

6735
01:54:56,400 --> 01:54:57,950
these places you see how things truly
are and generally I find that it's very

6736
01:54:57,950 --> 01:54:57,960
are and generally I find that it's very
 

6737
01:54:57,960 --> 01:54:59,149
are and generally I find that it's very
different than how the media will

6738
01:54:59,149 --> 01:54:59,159
different than how the media will
 

6739
01:54:59,159 --> 01:55:02,030
different than how the media will
portray it one of my great regrets is as

6740
01:55:02,030 --> 01:55:02,040
portray it one of my great regrets is as
 

6741
01:55:02,040 --> 01:55:04,010
portray it one of my great regrets is as
someone who loves history not going to

6742
01:55:04,010 --> 01:55:04,020
someone who loves history not going to
 

6743
01:55:04,020 --> 01:55:05,990
someone who loves history not going to
see Magnus lepta which were the greatest

6744
01:55:05,990 --> 01:55:06,000
see Magnus lepta which were the greatest
 

6745
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,930
see Magnus lepta which were the greatest
ruins I think greatest ruins in Africa

6746
01:55:08,930 --> 01:55:08,940
ruins I think greatest ruins in Africa
 

6747
01:55:08,940 --> 01:55:11,270
ruins I think greatest ruins in Africa
from the Roman times and of course no

6748
01:55:11,270 --> 01:55:11,280
from the Roman times and of course no
 

6749
01:55:11,280 --> 01:55:13,729
from the Roman times and of course no
longer exists so I really do regret that

6750
01:55:13,729 --> 01:55:13,739
longer exists so I really do regret that
 

6751
01:55:13,739 --> 01:55:15,950
longer exists so I really do regret that
I think another thing that's very unique

6752
01:55:15,950 --> 01:55:15,960
I think another thing that's very unique
 

6753
01:55:15,960 --> 01:55:18,649
I think another thing that's very unique
about Chess is that all of us even when

6754
01:55:18,649 --> 01:55:18,659
about Chess is that all of us even when
 

6755
01:55:18,659 --> 01:55:20,090
about Chess is that all of us even when
we compete as children like there are a

6756
01:55:20,090 --> 01:55:20,100
we compete as children like there are a
 

6757
01:55:20,100 --> 01:55:21,290
we compete as children like there are a
lot of people like nepo and others who

6758
01:55:21,290 --> 01:55:21,300
lot of people like nepo and others who
 

6759
01:55:21,300 --> 01:55:22,729
lot of people like nepo and others who
have known for a very very long time

6760
01:55:22,729 --> 01:55:22,739
have known for a very very long time
 

6761
01:55:22,739 --> 01:55:24,410
have known for a very very long time
there are a lot of people who no longer

6762
01:55:24,410 --> 01:55:24,420
there are a lot of people who no longer
 

6763
01:55:24,420 --> 01:55:26,689
there are a lot of people who no longer
play chess competitively but inevitably

6764
01:55:26,689 --> 01:55:26,699
play chess competitively but inevitably
 

6765
01:55:26,699 --> 01:55:28,430
play chess competitively but inevitably
you end up talking to these people many

6766
01:55:28,430 --> 01:55:28,440
you end up talking to these people many
 

6767
01:55:28,440 --> 01:55:30,470
you end up talking to these people many
years down the road and so you never

6768
01:55:30,470 --> 01:55:30,480
years down the road and so you never
 

6769
01:55:30,480 --> 01:55:32,390
years down the road and so you never
truly lose touch with the game or the

6770
01:55:32,390 --> 01:55:32,400
truly lose touch with the game or the
 

6771
01:55:32,400 --> 01:55:33,770
truly lose touch with the game or the
people that you grew up playing it with

6772
01:55:33,770 --> 01:55:33,780
people that you grew up playing it with
 

6773
01:55:33,780 --> 01:55:35,750
people that you grew up playing it with
and there's so many of these people that

6774
01:55:35,750 --> 01:55:35,760
and there's so many of these people that
 

6775
01:55:35,760 --> 01:55:37,310
and there's so many of these people that
like I connected with in the last couple

6776
01:55:37,310 --> 01:55:37,320
like I connected with in the last couple
 

6777
01:55:37,320 --> 01:55:39,350
like I connected with in the last couple
of years who I knew when I was a kid and

01:57:51,649 --> 01:57:51,659
like there is really a life without all
 

6897
01:57:51,659 --> 01:57:53,330
like there is really a life without all
this stuff or there was at least at some

6934
01:58:37,010 --> 01:58:37,020
because so many people kind of developed
 

6935
01:58:37,020 --> 01:58:40,970
because so many people kind of developed
their mind by watching twitch and

6936
01:58:40,970 --> 01:58:40,980

01:58:44,699 --> 01:58:46,010
definitely true for like for for myself
I remember when I was a little bit

6942
01:58:46,010 --> 01:58:46,020
I remember when I was a little bit
 

6943
01:58:46,020 --> 01:58:47,629
I remember when I was a little bit
younger when I was like 17 18 around

6944
01:58:47,629 --> 01:58:47,639
younger when I was like 17 18 around
 

6945
01:58:47,639 --> 01:58:49,669
younger when I was like 17 18 around
then I would actually try one one day a

01:58:49,669 --> 01:58:49,679
then I would actually try one one day a
 

6947
01:58:49,679 --> 01:58:51,290
then I would actually try one one day a
week on the weekend to try not to look

6948
01:58:51,290 --> 01:58:51,300
week on the weekend to try not to look
 

6949
01:58:51,300 --> 01:58:53,330
week on the weekend to try not to look
at like my computer or my phone now

6950
01:58:53,330 --> 01:58:53,340
at like my computer or my phone now
 

6951
01:58:53,340 --> 01:58:54,890
at like my computer or my phone now
phones weren't where they are today

6952
01:58:54,890 --> 01:58:54,900
phones weren't where they are today
 

6953
01:58:54,900 --> 01:58:56,870
phones weren't where they are today
obviously but I was able to do that

6954
01:58:56,870 --> 01:58:56,880
obviously but I was able to do that
 

6955
01:58:56,880 --> 01:58:58,550
obviously but I was able to do that
pretty easily now it's very hard like

6956
01:58:58,550 --> 01:58:58,560
pretty easily now it's very hard like
 

6957
01:58:58,560 --> 01:59:00,589
pretty easily now it's very hard like
when I try to go one day recently I

6958
01:59:00,589 --> 01:59:00,599
when I try to go one day recently I
 

6959
01:59:00,599 --> 01:59:02,089
when I try to go one day recently I
tried to do that like I actually just

6960
01:59:02,089 --> 01:59:02,099
tried to do that like I actually just
 

6961
01:59:02,099 --> 01:59:03,890
tried to do that like I actually just
pulled some books out of my garage and I

6962
01:59:03,890 --> 01:59:03,900
pulled some books out of my garage and I
 

6963
01:59:03,900 --> 01:59:05,750
pulled some books out of my garage and I
started reading and it was a very

6964
01:59:05,750 --> 01:59:05,760
started reading and it was a very
 

6965
01:59:05,760 --> 01:59:07,490
started reading and it was a very
foreign concept because I do read a lot

6966
01:59:07,490 --> 01:59:07,500
foreign concept because I do read a lot
 

6967
01:59:07,500 --> 01:59:09,109
foreign concept because I do read a lot
but it's always on it's always on an

6968
01:59:09,109 --> 01:59:09,119
but it's always on it's always on an

6973
01:59:12,960 --> 01:59:15,830
actually
um so it's it's very very weird but I do

6974
01:59:15,830 --> 01:59:15,840
um so it's it's very very weird but I do
 

6975
01:59:15,840 --> 01:59:19,129
um so it's it's very very weird but I do
try when I can to get away from it all

6976
01:59:19,129 --> 01:59:19,139
try when I can to get away from it all
 

6977
01:59:19,139 --> 01:59:21,109

6981
01:59:22,619 --> 01:59:24,109
really like going out into nature when I
have the opportunity I've spent a lot of

6982
01:59:24,109 --> 01:59:24,119
have the opportunity I've spent a lot of
 

6983
01:59:24,119 --> 01:59:26,270
have the opportunity I've spent a lot of
time in Colorado for example hiking

6984
01:59:26,270 --> 01:59:26,280
time in Colorado for example hiking
 

6985
01:59:26,280 --> 01:59:28,669
time in Colorado for example hiking
hiking some of the 14ers that is one of

6986
01:59:28,669 --> 01:59:28,679
hiking some of the 14ers that is one of
 

6987
01:59:28,679 --> 01:59:30,530
hiking some of the 14ers that is one of
those life goals that I have to go and

6988
01:59:30,530 --> 01:59:30,540
those life goals that I have to go and
 

6989
01:59:30,540 --> 01:59:32,089
those life goals that I have to go and
get to the top of every single one of

6990
01:59:32,089 --> 01:59:32,099
get to the top of every single one of
 

6991
01:59:32,099 --> 01:59:32,870
get to the top of every single one of
them

6992
01:59:32,870 --> 01:59:32,880
them
 

6993
01:59:32,880 --> 01:59:34,790
them
um so I try to disconnect when I can but

6994
01:59:34,790 --> 01:59:34,800
um so I try to disconnect when I can but
 

6995
01:59:34,800 --> 01:59:36,950
um so I try to disconnect when I can but
of course it's very hard

6996
01:59:36,950 --> 01:59:36,960
of course it's very hard
 

6997
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:38,390
of course it's very hard
so

6998
01:59:38,390 --> 01:59:38,400
so
 

6999
01:59:38,400 --> 01:59:40,850
so
whether it's disconnecting or not can

7000
01:59:40,850 --> 01:59:40,860
whether it's disconnecting or not can
 

7001
01:59:40,860 --> 01:59:42,589
whether it's disconnecting or not can
you take me through a perfect day in the

7002
01:59:42,589 --> 01:59:42,599
you take me through a perfect day in the
 

7003
01:59:42,599 --> 01:59:45,350
you take me through a perfect day in the
life of a car and Nakamura on a day of a

7004
01:59:45,350 --> 01:59:45,360
life of a car and Nakamura on a day of a
 

7005
01:59:45,360 --> 01:59:48,250
life of a car and Nakamura on a day of a
big chess match

7006
01:59:48,250 --> 01:59:48,260

 

7007
01:59:48,260 --> 01:59:50,570

multiple days right we'll take one where

7008
01:59:50,570 --> 01:59:50,580
multiple days right we'll take one where
 

7009
01:59:50,580 --> 01:59:52,310
multiple days right we'll take one where
it's a big chess match and one that's

7010
01:59:52,310 --> 01:59:52,320
it's a big chess match and one that's
 

7011
01:59:52,320 --> 01:59:54,830
it's a big chess match and one that's
just like your representative average

7012
01:59:54,830 --> 01:59:54,840
just like your representative average
 

7013
01:59:54,840 --> 01:59:57,290
just like your representative average
day a perfect chest day although I

7014
01:59:57,290 --> 01:59:57,300
day a perfect chest day although I
 

7015
01:59:57,300 --> 01:59:59,570
day a perfect chest day although I
cannot do this uh it would start like

7016
01:59:59,570 --> 01:59:59,580
cannot do this uh it would start like
 

7017
01:59:59,580 --> 02:00:01,010
cannot do this uh it would start like
the night before I would get like nine

7018
02:00:01,010 --> 02:00:01,020
the night before I would get like nine
 

7019
02:00:01,020 --> 02:00:03,410
the night before I would get like nine
hours of sleep uh like a consistent nine

7020
02:00:03,410 --> 02:00:03,420
hours of sleep uh like a consistent nine
 

7021
02:00:03,420 --> 02:00:05,750
hours of sleep uh like a consistent nine
hours like say 12 a.m to 9 A.M for

7022
02:00:05,750 --> 02:00:05,760
hours like say 12 a.m to 9 A.M for
 

7023
02:00:05,760 --> 02:00:07,189
hours like say 12 a.m to 9 A.M for
example let's just say the round starts

7024
02:00:07,189 --> 02:00:07,199
example let's just say the round starts
 

7025

02:00:17,870 --> 02:00:17,880
completely unrelated to it that would be
 

7035
02:00:17,880 --> 02:00:19,010
completely unrelated to it that would be
the perfect day

hear like the birds I try to listen it's
one of those like meditation kind of

7054
02:00:35,870 --> 02:00:35,880
one of those like meditation kind of
 

7055
02:00:35,880 --> 02:00:37,129
one of those like meditation kind of
things like you know they always say

7056
02:00:37,129 --> 02:00:37,139
things like you know they always say
 

7057
02:00:37,139 --> 02:00:38,810
things like you know they always say
when you meditate you try to try to hear

7058
02:00:38,810 --> 02:00:38,820
when you meditate you try to try to hear
 

7059
02:00:38,820 --> 02:00:40,129
when you meditate you try to try to hear
yourself breathing it's like when you

7060
02:00:40,129 --> 02:00:40,139
yourself breathing it's like when you
 

7061
02:00:40,139 --> 02:00:41,450
yourself breathing it's like when you
close your eyes try to hear yourself

7062
02:00:41,450 --> 02:00:41,460
close your eyes try to hear yourself
 

7063
02:00:41,460 --> 02:00:43,970
close your eyes try to hear yourself
breathing just focus on that so I do try

7064
02:00:43,970 --> 02:00:43,980
breathing just focus on that so I do try
 

7065
02:00:43,980 --> 02:00:46,010
breathing just focus on that so I do try
to do things like that uh from time to

7066
02:00:46,010 --> 02:00:46,020
to do things like that uh from time to
 

7067
02:00:46,020 --> 02:00:48,290
to do things like that uh from time to
time as well so in terms of getting nine

7068
02:00:48,290 --> 02:00:48,300
time as well so in terms of getting nine
 

7069
02:00:48,300 --> 02:00:50,330
time as well so in terms of getting nine
hours of sleep that that come difficult

7070
02:00:50,330 --> 02:00:50,340
hours of sleep that that come difficult
 

7071
02:00:50,340 --> 02:00:52,550
hours of sleep that that come difficult
to you that almost never happens I mean

7072
02:00:52,550 --> 02:00:52,560
to you that almost never happens I mean
 

7073
02:00:52,560 --> 02:00:53,750
to you that almost never happens I mean
there have been a couple times where it

7074
02:00:53,750 --> 02:00:53,760
there have been a couple times where it
 

7075
02:00:53,760 --> 02:00:55,550
there have been a couple times where it
has happened like in Norway specifically

7076
02:00:55,550 --> 02:00:55,560
has happened like in Norway specifically
 

7077
02:00:55,560 --> 02:00:58,070
has happened like in Norway specifically
but generally it just I don't sleep well

7078
02:00:58,070 --> 02:00:58,080
but generally it just I don't sleep well
 

7079
02:00:58,080 --> 02:01:00,830
but generally it just I don't sleep well
during trust terms I wish I did but but

7080
02:01:00,830 --> 02:01:00,840
during trust terms I wish I did but but
 

7081
02:01:00,840 --> 02:01:02,330
during trust terms I wish I did but but
so we're talking about a perfect day so

7082
02:01:02,330 --> 02:01:02,340
so we're talking about a perfect day so
 

7083
02:01:02,340 --> 02:01:03,890
so we're talking about a perfect day so
sleep is really important what about

7084
02:01:03,890 --> 02:01:03,900
sleep is really important what about
 

7085
02:01:03,900 --> 02:01:06,890
sleep is really important what about
diet and stuff like that yeah I think uh

7086
02:01:06,890 --> 02:01:06,900
diet and stuff like that yeah I think uh
 

7087
02:01:06,900 --> 02:01:08,689
diet and stuff like that yeah I think uh
for a lot of people they try to keep it

7088
02:01:08,689 --> 02:01:08,699
for a lot of people they try to keep it
 

7089
02:01:08,699 --> 02:01:10,609
for a lot of people they try to keep it

remember hearing the story from uh Peter

7092
02:01:12,470 --> 02:01:12,480
remember hearing the story from uh Peter
 

7093
02:01:12,480 --> 02:01:14,330
remember hearing the story from uh Peter
sevidler some years back a Russian GM

7094
02:01:14,330 --> 02:01:14,340
sevidler some years back a Russian GM
 

7095
02:01:14,340 --> 02:01:16,430
sevidler some years back a Russian GM
and he said that kaspara would go and

7096
02:01:16,430 --> 02:01:16,440
and he said that kaspara would go and
 

7097
02:01:16,440 --> 02:01:18,109
and he said that kaspara would go and
eat like a big steak right before the

7098
02:01:18,109 --> 02:01:18,119
eat like a big steak right before the
 

7099
02:01:18,119 --> 02:01:19,370
eat like a big steak right before the
game and he would he would be completely

7100
02:01:19,370 --> 02:01:19,380
game and he would he would be completely
 

7101
02:01:19,380 --> 02:01:21,709
game and he would he would be completely
fine but I think for most players it's

7102
02:01:21,709 --> 02:01:21,719
fine but I think for most players it's
 

7103
02:01:21,719 --> 02:01:23,330
fine but I think for most players it's
the exact opposite you try to like eat

7104
02:01:23,330 --> 02:01:23,340
the exact opposite you try to like eat
 

7105
02:01:23,340 --> 02:01:25,310
the exact opposite you try to like eat
like some snacks like maybe some nuts a

7106
02:01:25,310 --> 02:01:25,320
like some snacks like maybe some nuts a
 

7107
02:01:25,320 --> 02:01:26,930
like some snacks like maybe some nuts a
few bars things of this nature or maybe

7108
02:01:26,930 --> 02:01:26,940
few bars things of this nature or maybe
 

7109
02:01:26,940 --> 02:01:28,550
few bars things of this nature or maybe
just like maybe fish something very

7110
02:01:28,550 --> 02:01:28,560
just like maybe fish something very
 

7111
02:01:28,560 --> 02:01:30,050
just like maybe fish something very
light for lunch

7112
02:01:30,050 --> 02:01:30,060
light for lunch
 

7113
02:01:30,060 --> 02:01:31,910
light for lunch
um before the game and then then you

7114
02:01:31,910 --> 02:01:31,920
um before the game and then then you
 

7115
02:01:31,920 --> 02:01:33,950
um before the game and then then you
probably eat a lot after the game that's

7116
02:01:33,950 --> 02:01:33,960
probably eat a lot after the game that's
 

7117
02:01:33,960 --> 02:01:35,810
probably eat a lot after the game that's
generally what you try to do but I don't

7118
02:01:35,810 --> 02:01:35,820
generally what you try to do but I don't
 

7119
02:01:35,820 --> 02:01:37,430
generally what you try to do but I don't
think there's any like specific diet

7120
02:01:37,430 --> 02:01:37,440
think there's any like specific diet
 

7121
02:01:37,440 --> 02:01:39,290
think there's any like specific diet
that makes a huge difference but every

7122
02:01:39,290 --> 02:01:39,300
that makes a huge difference but every
 

7123
02:01:39,300 --> 02:01:41,089
that makes a huge difference but every
everyone is different of course so when

7124
02:01:41,089 --> 02:01:41,099
everyone is different of course so when
 

7125
02:01:41,099 --> 02:01:44,629
everyone is different of course so when
you're actually at the board

7126
02:01:44,629 --> 02:01:44,639

 

7127
02:01:44,639 --> 02:01:47,270

on that perfect day how do you maintain

7128
02:01:47,270 --> 02:01:47,280
on that perfect day how do you maintain
 

7129
02:01:47,280 --> 02:01:48,950
on that perfect day how do you maintain
Focus for so many hours of classical

7130
02:01:48,950 --> 02:01:48,960
Focus for so many hours of classical
 

7131
02:01:48,960 --> 02:01:51,649
Focus for so many hours of classical
chess like like

7132
02:01:51,649 --> 02:01:51,659
chess like like
 

7133
02:01:51,659 --> 02:01:53,629
chess like like
um you know what like minute to minute

7134
02:01:53,629 --> 02:01:53,639
um you know what like minute to minute
 

7135
02:01:53,639 --> 02:01:55,850
um you know what like minute to minute
second to Second how are you able to

7136
02:01:55,850 --> 02:01:55,860
second to Second how are you able to
 

7137
02:01:55,860 --> 02:01:57,890
second to Second how are you able to
maintain focus is there tricks to that

7138
02:01:57,890 --> 02:01:57,900
maintain focus is there tricks to that
 

7139
02:01:57,900 --> 02:02:00,830
maintain focus is there tricks to that
how difficult is that I think it really

7140
02:02:00,830 --> 02:02:00,840
how difficult is that I think it really
 

7141
02:02:00,840 --> 02:02:02,689
how difficult is that I think it really
depends on the type of the game that

7142
02:02:02,689 --> 02:02:02,699
depends on the type of the game that
 

7143
02:02:02,699 --> 02:02:04,010
depends on the type of the game that
you're playing I think if it's a game

7144
02:02:04,010 --> 02:02:04,020
you're playing I think if it's a game
 

7145
02:02:04,020 --> 02:02:06,229
you're playing I think if it's a game
that's very very calm and very slow or

7146
02:02:06,229 --> 02:02:06,239
that's very very calm and very slow or
 

7147
02:02:06,239 --> 02:02:08,330
that's very very calm and very slow or
not a lot happens at the start it's a

7148
02:02:08,330 --> 02:02:08,340
not a lot happens at the start it's a
 

7149
02:02:08,340 --> 02:02:10,970
not a lot happens at the start it's a
it's a lot easier because because you're

7150
02:02:10,970 --> 02:02:10,980
it's a lot easier because because you're
 

7151
02:02:10,980 --> 02:02:12,830
it's a lot easier because because you're
not having to be super focused like your

7152
02:02:12,830 --> 02:02:12,840
not having to be super focused like your
 

7153
02:02:12,840 --> 02:02:14,510
not having to be super focused like your
mind can drift and whatnot and the

7154
02:02:14,510 --> 02:02:14,520
mind can drift and whatnot and the
 

7155
02:02:14,520 --> 02:02:15,950
mind can drift and whatnot and the
critical moment you have to sort of Zone

7156
02:02:15,950 --> 02:02:15,960
critical moment you have to sort of Zone
 

7157
02:02:15,960 --> 02:02:16,729
critical moment you have to sort of Zone
in

7158
02:02:16,729 --> 02:02:16,739
in
 

7159
02:02:16,739 --> 02:02:18,229
in
um so those are the easiest ones I think

7160
02:02:18,229 --> 02:02:18,239
um so those are the easiest ones I think
 

7161
02:02:18,239 --> 02:02:20,270
um so those are the easiest ones I think
generally when when games are very

7162
02:02:20,270 --> 02:02:20,280
generally when when games are very
 

7163
02:02:20,280 --> 02:02:23,149
generally when when games are very
complicated from the start uh what

7164
02:02:23,149 --> 02:02:23,159
complicated from the start uh what
 

7165
02:02:23,159 --> 02:02:24,649
complicated from the start uh what
you're doing is you're you're just

7166
02:02:24,649 --> 02:02:24,659
you're doing is you're you're just
 

7167
02:02:24,659 --> 02:02:26,689
you're doing is you're you're just
you're you're trying to not let your

7168
02:02:26,689 --> 02:02:26,699
you're you're trying to not let your
 

7169
02:02:26,699 --> 02:02:28,310
you're you're trying to not let your
mind wander at all because when games

7170
02:02:28,310 --> 02:02:28,320
mind wander at all because when games
 

7171
02:02:28,320 --> 02:02:29,689
mind wander at all because when games
are complicated like that one of the

7172
02:02:29,689 --> 02:02:29,699
are complicated like that one of the
 

7173
02:02:29,699 --> 02:02:31,010
are complicated like that one of the
things that I've never been very good at

7174
02:02:31,010 --> 02:02:31,020
things that I've never been very good at
 

7175
02:02:31,020 --> 02:02:32,810
things that I've never been very good at
is my mind does wander and you're always

7176
02:02:32,810 --> 02:02:32,820
is my mind does wander and you're always
 

7177
02:02:32,820 --> 02:02:34,550
is my mind does wander and you're always
like I'm always worrying about the next

7178
02:02:34,550 --> 02:02:34,560
like I'm always worrying about the next
 

7179
02:02:34,560 --> 02:02:36,109
like I'm always worrying about the next
move it's like is this a blunder what's

7180
02:02:36,109 --> 02:02:36,119
move it's like is this a blunder what's
 

7181
02:02:36,119 --> 02:02:39,229
move it's like is this a blunder what's
what's going on like what am I gonna do

7182
02:02:39,229 --> 02:02:39,239
what's going on like what am I gonna do
 

7183
02:02:39,239 --> 02:02:41,689
what's going on like what am I gonna do
um so you're trying I think very much to

7184
02:02:41,689 --> 02:02:41,699
um so you're trying I think very much to
 

7185
02:02:41,699 --> 02:02:43,250
um so you're trying I think very much to
block out the noise I think that's

7186
02:02:43,250 --> 02:02:43,260
block out the noise I think that's
 

7187
02:02:43,260 --> 02:02:45,530
block out the noise I think that's
actually the hardest thing is is also

7188
02:02:45,530 --> 02:02:45,540
actually the hardest thing is is also
 

7189
02:02:45,540 --> 02:02:46,850
actually the hardest thing is is also
because like I can say this when I

7190
02:02:46,850 --> 02:02:46,860
because like I can say this when I
 

7191
02:02:46,860 --> 02:02:48,350
because like I can say this when I
played Magnus before there have been

7192
02:02:48,350 --> 02:02:48,360
played Magnus before there have been
 

7193
02:02:48,360 --> 02:02:49,850
played Magnus before there have been
times when I've gotten winning positions

7194
02:02:49,850 --> 02:02:49,860
times when I've gotten winning positions
 

7195
02:02:49,860 --> 02:02:51,830
times when I've gotten winning positions
against him and in that moment when I

7196
02:02:51,830 --> 02:02:51,840
against him and in that moment when I
 

7197
02:02:51,840 --> 02:02:53,209
against him and in that moment when I
have the winning position very often

7198
02:02:53,209 --> 02:02:53,219
have the winning position very often
 

7199
02:02:53,219 --> 02:02:54,709
have the winning position very often
times my mind wanders like okay you're

7200
02:02:54,709 --> 02:02:54,719
times my mind wanders like okay you're
 

7201
02:02:54,719 --> 02:02:56,089
times my mind wanders like okay you're
about to win this game and you're like

7202
02:02:56,089 --> 02:02:56,099
about to win this game and you're like
 

7203
02:02:56,099 --> 02:02:57,649
about to win this game and you're like
okay what happens after the game you win

7204
02:02:57,649 --> 02:02:57,659
okay what happens after the game you win
 

7205
02:02:57,659 --> 02:02:59,030
okay what happens after the game you win
this game gain the rating points all

7206
02:02:59,030 --> 02:02:59,040
this game gain the rating points all
 

7207
02:02:59,040 --> 02:03:00,770
this game gain the rating points all
these different things but you haven't

7208
02:03:00,770 --> 02:03:00,780
these different things but you haven't
 

7209
02:03:00,780 --> 02:03:02,689
these different things but you haven't
actually won the game yet and I think

7210
02:03:02,689 --> 02:03:02,699
actually won the game yet and I think
 

7211
02:03:02,699 --> 02:03:04,070
actually won the game yet and I think
for a lot of players that's the hardest

7212
02:03:04,070 --> 02:03:04,080
for a lot of players that's the hardest
 

7213
02:03:04,080 --> 02:03:05,149
for a lot of players that's the hardest
thing is when you get a winning position

7214
02:03:05,149 --> 02:03:05,159
thing is when you get a winning position
 

7215
02:03:05,159 --> 02:03:07,609
thing is when you get a winning position
your mind does drift it drifts to like

7216
02:03:07,609 --> 02:03:07,619
your mind does drift it drifts to like
 

7217
02:03:07,619 --> 02:03:10,010
your mind does drift it drifts to like
what the what happens after after you've

7218
02:03:10,010 --> 02:03:10,020
what the what happens after after you've
 

7219
02:03:10,020 --> 02:03:12,109
what the what happens after after you've
won the game or what the outcome is so

7220
02:03:12,109 --> 02:03:12,119
won the game or what the outcome is so
 

7221
02:03:12,119 --> 02:03:14,209
won the game or what the outcome is so
yeah drifting into the future and you

7222
02:03:14,209 --> 02:03:14,219
yeah drifting into the future and you
 

7223
02:03:14,219 --> 02:03:15,410
yeah drifting into the future and you
should say in the moment you really

7224
02:03:15,410 --> 02:03:15,420
should say in the moment you really
 

7225

should yes like hold on and also
what is it uh yeah probably getting

7228
02:03:21,649 --> 02:03:21,659
what is it uh yeah probably getting
 

7229
02:03:21,659 --> 02:03:24,649
what is it uh yeah probably getting
excited about the win what what is that

too excited I think you just you it's
like you're waiting for a time you

7244
02:03:37,070 --> 02:03:37,080
like you're waiting for a time you
 

7245
02:03:37,080 --> 02:03:39,050
like you're waiting for a time you
expect it to end and then and then your

7246
02:03:39,050 --> 02:03:39,060
expect it to end and then and then your
 

7247
02:03:39,060 --> 02:03:41,030
expect it to end and then and then your
opponent keeps keeps defending and and

7248
02:03:41,030 --> 02:03:41,040
opponent keeps keeps defending and and
 

7249
02:03:41,040 --> 02:03:43,129
opponent keeps keeps defending and and
you can make mistakes what about the

7250
02:03:43,129 --> 02:03:43,139
you can make mistakes what about the
 

7251
02:03:43,139 --> 02:03:44,510
you can make mistakes what about the
flip side of that where you start

7252
02:03:44,510 --> 02:03:44,520
flip side of that where you start
 

7253
02:03:44,520 --> 02:03:47,089
flip side of that where you start
getting frustrated like how do you try

7254
02:03:47,089 --> 02:03:47,099
getting frustrated like how do you try
 

7255
02:03:47,099 --> 02:03:49,669
getting frustrated like how do you try
to recover from that kind of thing it's

7256
02:03:49,669 --> 02:03:49,679
to recover from that kind of thing it's
 

7257
02:03:49,679 --> 02:03:52,850
to recover from that kind of thing it's
very difficult I I think for myself I

7258
02:03:52,850 --> 02:03:52,860
very difficult I I think for myself I
 

7259
02:03:52,860 --> 02:03:55,430
very difficult I I think for myself I
just try I try to basically focus on it

7260
02:03:55,430 --> 02:03:55,440
just try I try to basically focus on it
 

7261
02:03:55,440 --> 02:03:57,109
just try I try to basically focus on it
every single move I just try and again

7262
02:03:57,109 --> 02:03:57,119
every single move I just try and again
 

7263
02:03:57,119 --> 02:03:59,030
every single move I just try and again
you try to block out the noise no matter

7264
02:03:59,030 --> 02:03:59,040
you try to block out the noise no matter
 

7265
02:03:59,040 --> 02:04:01,129
you try to block out the noise no matter
which direction it's going in so I try

7266
02:04:01,129 --> 02:04:01,139
which direction it's going in so I try
 

7267
02:04:01,139 --> 02:04:03,290
which direction it's going in so I try
as best I can I mean sometimes I'm very

7268
02:04:03,290 --> 02:04:03,300
as best I can I mean sometimes I'm very
 

7269
02:04:03,300 --> 02:04:05,030
as best I can I mean sometimes I'm very
poor at it like I just don't do a good

7270
02:04:05,030 --> 02:04:05,040
poor at it like I just don't do a good
 

7271
02:04:05,040 --> 02:04:07,010
poor at it like I just don't do a good
job uh blocking out the noise at all but

7272
02:04:07,010 --> 02:04:07,020
job uh blocking out the noise at all but
 

7273
02:04:07,020 --> 02:04:08,390
job uh blocking out the noise at all but
I think generally I try to think okay

7274
02:04:08,390 --> 02:04:08,400
I think generally I try to think okay
 

7275
02:04:08,400 --> 02:04:09,950
I think generally I try to think okay
just make this next move make your

7276
02:04:09,950 --> 02:04:09,960
just make this next move make your
 

7277
02:04:09,960 --> 02:04:12,109
just make this next move make your
opponent have to find the best moves and

7278
02:04:12,109 --> 02:04:12,119
opponent have to find the best moves and
 

7279

what's a long day of classical chess

7284
02:04:18,589 --> 02:04:18,599
what's a long day of classical chess
 

7285
02:04:18,599 --> 02:04:20,270
what's a long day of classical chess
what's that look like this it's pretty

7286
02:04:20,270 --> 02:04:20,280
what's that look like this it's pretty
 

7287
02:04:20,280 --> 02:04:22,010
what's that look like this it's pretty
brutal I mean it would be something like

7288
02:04:22,010 --> 02:04:22,020
brutal I mean it would be something like
 

7289
02:04:22,020 --> 02:04:23,629
brutal I mean it would be something like
okay so the game starts at two o'clock

7290
02:04:23,629 --> 02:04:23,639
okay so the game starts at two o'clock
 

7291
02:04:23,639 --> 02:04:25,189
okay so the game starts at two o'clock
so you've done all this other stuff the

7292
02:04:25,189 --> 02:04:25,199
so you've done all this other stuff the
 

7293
02:04:25,199 --> 02:04:26,689
so you've done all this other stuff the
game probably goes from like two to

7294
02:04:26,689 --> 02:04:26,699
game probably goes from like two to
 

7295
02:04:26,699 --> 02:04:28,669
game probably goes from like two to
seven for example or maybe two to eight

7296
02:04:28,669 --> 02:04:28,679
seven for example or maybe two to eight
 

7297
02:04:28,679 --> 02:04:31,550
seven for example or maybe two to eight
five six hours probably eat uh you eat

02:04:31,550 --> 02:04:31,560
five six hours probably eat uh you eat
 

7299
02:04:31,560 --> 02:04:33,229
five six hours probably eat uh you eat
dinner for an hour or so maybe clear

minutes and then immediately it's right

7304
02:04:36,410 --> 02:04:36,420
minutes and then immediately it's right
 

7305
02:04:36,420 --> 02:04:37,910
minutes and then immediately it's right
back to studying for a couple of hours

7306
02:04:37,910 --> 02:04:37,920
back to studying for a couple of hours
 

7307
02:04:37,920 --> 02:04:40,250
back to studying for a couple of hours
are you reviewing previous games are you

7308
02:04:40,250 --> 02:04:40,260
are you reviewing previous games are you
 

7309
02:04:40,260 --> 02:04:41,810
are you reviewing previous games are you
already uh generally you're just moving

7310
02:04:41,810 --> 02:04:41,820
already uh generally you're just moving
 

7311
02:04:41,820 --> 02:04:43,310
already uh generally you're just moving
on to the next game that's what you're

7312
02:04:43,310 --> 02:04:43,320
on to the next game that's what you're
 

7313
02:04:43,320 --> 02:04:45,410
on to the next game that's what you're
not and trying to no matter what

7314
02:04:45,410 --> 02:04:45,420
not and trying to no matter what
 

7315
02:04:45,420 --> 02:04:47,870
not and trying to no matter what
happened put that behind you yeah win or

lose or draw
okay so that's that's also why there's

7320
02:04:52,550 --> 02:04:52,560
okay so that's that's also why there's
 

7321
02:04:52,560 --> 02:04:53,689
okay so that's that's also why there's
another question a lot of people wonder

7322
02:04:53,689 --> 02:04:53,699
another question a lot of people wonder
 

7323
02:04:53,699 --> 02:04:55,129
another question a lot of people wonder
which is why don't I play more of these

7324
02:04:55,129 --> 02:04:55,139
which is why don't I play more of these
 

7325
02:04:55,139 --> 02:04:57,050
which is why don't I play more of these
classical tournaments and

7326
02:04:57,050 --> 02:04:57,060
classical tournaments and
 

7327
02:04:57,060 --> 02:04:59,390
classical tournaments and
sort of it gets back to the you know the

7328
02:04:59,390 --> 02:04:59,400
sort of it gets back to the you know the
 

7329
02:04:59,400 --> 02:05:00,950
sort of it gets back to the you know the
literally don't cares for his stuff but

7330
02:05:00,950 --> 02:05:00,960
literally don't cares for his stuff but
 

7331
02:05:00,960 --> 02:05:03,050
literally don't cares for his stuff but
when I'm going to play in tournaments I

7332
02:05:03,050 --> 02:05:03,060
when I'm going to play in tournaments I
 

7333
02:05:03,060 --> 02:05:04,729
when I'm going to play in tournaments I
want to be able to give it my best shot

7334
02:05:04,729 --> 02:05:04,739
want to be able to give it my best shot
 

7335
02:05:04,739 --> 02:05:07,729
want to be able to give it my best shot
and if I don't feel that I can I'm not

7336
02:05:07,729 --> 02:05:07,739
and if I don't feel that I can I'm not
 

7337
02:05:07,739 --> 02:05:10,430
and if I don't feel that I can I'm not
going to play which is why like I play

7338
02:05:10,430 --> 02:05:10,440
going to play which is why like I play
 

7339
02:05:10,440 --> 02:05:11,990
going to play which is why like I play
here and there but I do balance my

7340
02:05:11,990 --> 02:05:12,000
here and there but I do balance my
 

7341
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,030
here and there but I do balance my
schedule very carefully because I'm not

7342
02:05:14,030 --> 02:05:14,040
schedule very carefully because I'm not
 

7343
02:05:14,040 --> 02:05:15,109
schedule very carefully because I'm not
just going to go and play tournament

just going to go and play tournament
 

7345
02:05:15,119 --> 02:05:16,970
just going to go and play tournament
simply because if I don't feel that I

7346
02:05:16,970 --> 02:05:16,980
simply because if I don't feel that I
 

7347
02:05:16,980 --> 02:05:19,430
simply because if I don't feel that I
can put in the work uh it's not it's not

investing trading for at least a decade
now

7438
02:06:45,050 --> 02:06:45,060
now
 

7439
02:06:45,060 --> 02:06:46,490
now
um so like I am very interested on that

7440

level I'm also quite interested as well
 

7443
02:06:48,360 --> 02:06:50,030
level I'm also quite interested as well
because when you see the policy that's

7444
02:06:50,030 --> 02:06:50,040
because when you see the policy that's
 

7445
02:06:50,040 --> 02:06:51,589
because when you see the policy that's
being dictated like you look in the last

7446
02:06:51,589 --> 02:06:51,599
being dictated like you look in the last
 

7447
02:06:51,599 --> 02:06:53,750
being dictated like you look in the last
last six months specifically you see the

7448
02:06:53,750 --> 02:06:53,760
last six months specifically you see the
 

7449
02:06:53,760 --> 02:06:55,310
last six months specifically you see the
FED policy around things like interest

7450
02:06:55,310 --> 02:06:55,320
FED policy around things like interest
 

7451
02:06:55,320 --> 02:06:58,129

rates unemployment things of this nature
 

7453
02:06:58,139 --> 02:07:00,169
rates unemployment things of this nature
it is something that interests me also

7454
02:07:00,169 --> 02:07:00,179
it is something that interests me also
 

7455
02:07:00,179 --> 02:07:02,209
it is something that interests me also
because I do invest in real estate aside

7456
02:07:02,209 --> 02:07:02,219
because I do invest in real estate aside
 

7457
02:07:02,219 --> 02:07:04,370
because I do invest in real estate aside
from the stock market so therefore I'm

7458
02:07:04,370 --> 02:07:04,380
from the stock market so therefore I'm
 

7459
02:07:04,380 --> 02:07:05,990
from the stock market so therefore I'm
always keeping an eye on these sorts of

7460
02:07:05,990 --> 02:07:06,000
always keeping an eye on these sorts of
 

7461
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,930
always keeping an eye on these sorts of
things and and always looking and as a

7462
02:07:08,930 --> 02:07:08,940
things and and always looking and as a
 

7463
02:07:08,940 --> 02:07:10,850
things and and always looking and as a
better example like I'm looking for

7464
02:07:10,850 --> 02:07:10,860
better example like I'm looking for
 

7465
02:07:10,860 --> 02:07:13,189
better example like I'm looking for
Trends so if we go back to I think it

7466
02:07:13,189 --> 02:07:13,199
Trends so if we go back to I think it
 

7467
02:07:13,199 --> 02:07:15,169
Trends so if we go back to I think it
was 20 I could have the year wrong it

7468
02:07:15,169 --> 02:07:15,179
was 20 I could have the year wrong it
 

7469
02:07:15,179 --> 02:07:16,970
was 20 I could have the year wrong it
was 2015 or 2016.

7470
02:07:16,970 --> 02:07:16,980
was 2015 or 2016.
 

7471
02:07:16,980 --> 02:07:18,890
was 2015 or 2016.
um there was a pattern that I found that

7472
02:07:18,890 --> 02:07:18,900
um there was a pattern that I found that
 

7473
02:07:18,900 --> 02:07:21,530
um there was a pattern that I found that
on the FED minutes that came out uh you

7474
02:07:21,530 --> 02:07:21,540
on the FED minutes that came out uh you
 

7475
02:07:21,540 --> 02:07:24,109
on the FED minutes that came out uh you
know I believe 2 215 I think it's on the

7476
02:07:24,109 --> 02:07:24,119
know I believe 2 215 I think it's on the
 

7477
02:07:24,119 --> 02:07:26,149
know I believe 2 215 I think it's on the
Wednesday of every third Wednesday of

7478
02:07:26,149 --> 02:07:26,159
Wednesday of every third Wednesday of
 

7479
02:07:26,159 --> 02:07:27,109
Wednesday of every third Wednesday of
every month

7480
02:07:27,109 --> 02:07:27,119
every month
 

7481
02:07:27,119 --> 02:07:28,970
every month
um that gold would actually the gold

7482
02:07:28,970 --> 02:07:28,980
um that gold would actually the gold
 

7483
02:07:28,980 --> 02:07:31,850
um that gold would actually the gold
ETFs and etns would actually go up uh

7484
02:07:31,850 --> 02:07:31,860
ETFs and etns would actually go up uh
 

7485
02:07:31,860 --> 02:07:33,709
ETFs and etns would actually go up uh
not every single every single Wednesday

7486
02:07:33,709 --> 02:07:33,719
not every single every single Wednesday
 

7487
02:07:33,719 --> 02:07:35,450
not every single every single Wednesday
of the month that the minutes came out

7488
02:07:35,450 --> 02:07:35,460
of the month that the minutes came out
 

7489
02:07:35,460 --> 02:07:37,669
of the month that the minutes came out
so I would follow things like that now

7490
02:07:37,669 --> 02:07:37,679
so I would follow things like that now
 

7491
02:07:37,679 --> 02:07:39,169
so I would follow things like that now
of course I wasn't like trading huge

7492
02:07:39,169 --> 02:07:39,179
of course I wasn't like trading huge
 

7493
02:07:39,179 --> 02:07:40,910
of course I wasn't like trading huge
huge volume but I found a trend there of

7494
02:07:40,910 --> 02:07:40,920
huge volume but I found a trend there of
 

7495
02:07:40,920 --> 02:07:42,229
huge volume but I found a trend there of
course it stopped working at a certain

7496
02:07:42,229 --> 02:07:42,239
course it stopped working at a certain
 

7497
02:07:42,239 --> 02:07:43,850
course it stopped working at a certain
point but those are the sorts of things

7498
02:07:43,850 --> 02:07:43,860
point but those are the sorts of things
 

7499
02:07:43,860 --> 02:07:45,350
point but those are the sorts of things
that they just interest me even if it's

7500
02:07:45,350 --> 02:07:45,360
that they just interest me even if it's
 

7501
02:07:45,360 --> 02:07:46,550
that they just interest me even if it's
not something I'm doing to make a living

7502
02:07:46,550 --> 02:07:46,560
not something I'm doing to make a living
 

7503
02:07:46,560 --> 02:07:48,770
not something I'm doing to make a living
trying to spot those Trends it's always

7504
02:07:48,770 --> 02:07:48,780
trying to spot those Trends it's always
 

7505
02:07:48,780 --> 02:07:50,450
trying to spot those Trends it's always
been something that has uh that has

7506
02:07:50,450 --> 02:07:50,460
been something that has uh that has
 

7507
02:07:50,460 --> 02:07:51,950
been something that has uh that has
fascinated me

7508
02:07:51,950 --> 02:07:51,960
fascinated me
 

7509
02:07:51,960 --> 02:07:55,010
fascinated me
one Reddit said that you shorted Tesla a

7510
02:07:55,010 --> 02:07:55,020
one Reddit said that you shorted Tesla a
 

7511
02:07:55,020 --> 02:07:58,729
one Reddit said that you shorted Tesla a
time ago uh do you regret doing so uh

7512
02:07:58,729 --> 02:07:58,739
time ago uh do you regret doing so uh
 

7513
02:07:58,739 --> 02:08:00,649
time ago uh do you regret doing so uh
well when I when I did those plays I was

7514
02:08:00,649 --> 02:08:00,659
well when I when I did those plays I was
 

7515
02:08:00,659 --> 02:08:02,390
well when I when I did those plays I was
only those small amounts of money and

7516
02:08:02,390 --> 02:08:02,400
only those small amounts of money and
 

7517
02:08:02,400 --> 02:08:04,669
only those small amounts of money and
that was only via uh via puts that was

7518
02:08:04,669 --> 02:08:04,679
that was only via uh via puts that was
 

7519
02:08:04,679 --> 02:08:07,010
that was only via uh via puts that was
where I would buy puts or put spreads um

7520
02:08:07,010 --> 02:08:07,020
where I would buy puts or put spreads um
 

7521
02:08:07,020 --> 02:08:08,510
where I would buy puts or put spreads um
on it so it wasn't something where I was

7522
02:08:08,510 --> 02:08:08,520
on it so it wasn't something where I was
 

7523
02:08:08,520 --> 02:08:10,070
on it so it wasn't something where I was
straight shorting I would I would never

7524
02:08:10,070 --> 02:08:10,080
straight shorting I would I would never
 

7525
02:08:10,080 --> 02:08:11,629
straight shorting I would I would never
actually do that

7526
02:08:11,629 --> 02:08:11,639
actually do that
 

7527
02:08:11,639 --> 02:08:13,550
actually do that
um because it's just it's not worth the

7528
02:08:13,550 --> 02:08:13,560
um because it's just it's not worth the
 

7529
02:08:13,560 --> 02:08:15,229
um because it's just it's not worth the
risk and I don't want to ever be in a

7530
02:08:15,229 --> 02:08:15,239
risk and I don't want to ever be in a
 

7531
02:08:15,239 --> 02:08:17,270
risk and I don't want to ever be in a
situation where I have to think about

7532
02:08:17,270 --> 02:08:17,280
situation where I have to think about
 

7533
02:08:17,280 --> 02:08:19,070
situation where I have to think about
those sorts of things and I think a

7534
02:08:19,070 --> 02:08:19,080
those sorts of things and I think a
 

7535
02:08:19,080 --> 02:08:21,229
those sorts of things and I think a
better example is there was a period in

7536
02:08:21,229 --> 02:08:21,239
better example is there was a period in
 

7537
02:08:21,239 --> 02:08:23,089
better example is there was a period in
2016 actually shortly before the

7538
02:08:23,089 --> 02:08:23,099
2016 actually shortly before the
 

7539
02:08:23,099 --> 02:08:25,430
2016 actually shortly before the
candidates when I actually was in oil I

7540
02:08:25,430 --> 02:08:25,440
candidates when I actually was in oil I
 

7541
02:08:25,440 --> 02:08:28,010
candidates when I actually was in oil I
had a long position in oil and this is

7542
02:08:28,010 --> 02:08:28,020
had a long position in oil and this is
 

7543
02:08:28,020 --> 02:08:30,530
had a long position in oil and this is

7544
02:08:30,530 --> 02:08:30,540
when oil completely crashed it went very
 

7545
02:08:30,540 --> 02:08:32,870
when oil completely crashed it went very
I don't think it went below did it go

7546
02:08:32,870 --> 02:08:32,880
I don't think it went below did it go
 

7547
02:08:32,880 --> 02:08:35,030
I don't think it went below did it go
below 30 even it went very low and and

7548
02:08:35,030 --> 02:08:35,040
below 30 even it went very low and and
 

7549
02:08:35,040 --> 02:08:37,550
below 30 even it went very low and and
of course the Saudis were not cutting

7550
02:08:37,550 --> 02:08:37,560
of course the Saudis were not cutting
 

7551
02:08:37,560 --> 02:08:40,010
of course the Saudis were not cutting
they were not um I think they they were

7552
02:08:40,010 --> 02:08:40,020
they were not um I think they they were
 

7553
02:08:40,020 --> 02:08:41,689
they were not um I think they they were
uh were they cutting or not cutting

7554
02:08:41,689 --> 02:08:41,699
uh were they cutting or not cutting
 

7555
02:08:41,699 --> 02:08:43,669
uh were they cutting or not cutting
production but anyway there was a period

7556
02:08:43,669 --> 02:08:43,679
production but anyway there was a period
 

7557
02:08:43,679 --> 02:08:45,229
production but anyway there was a period
in 2016 when I had a big long position

7558
02:08:45,229 --> 02:08:45,239
in 2016 when I had a big long position
 

7559
02:08:45,239 --> 02:08:48,229
in 2016 when I had a big long position
in one of the 3x oil ETFs and I I it

7560
02:08:48,229 --> 02:08:48,239
in one of the 3x oil ETFs and I I it
 

7561
02:08:48,239 --> 02:08:50,149
in one of the 3x oil ETFs and I I it
kept going down day after day after day

7562
02:08:50,149 --> 02:08:50,159
kept going down day after day after day
 

7563
02:08:50,159 --> 02:08:51,649
kept going down day after day after day
and then of course right near the bottom

7564
02:08:51,649 --> 02:08:51,659
and then of course right near the bottom
 

7565
02:08:51,659 --> 02:08:53,270
and then of course right near the bottom
of my finally couldn't take it anymore I

7566
02:08:53,270 --> 02:08:53,280
of my finally couldn't take it anymore I
 

7567
02:08:53,280 --> 02:08:56,870
of my finally couldn't take it anymore I
took a loss and that really sort of it

7568
02:08:56,870 --> 02:08:56,880
took a loss and that really sort of it
 

7569
02:08:56,880 --> 02:08:58,490
took a loss and that really sort of it
was very difficult dealing with that the

7570
02:08:58,490 --> 02:08:58,500
was very difficult dealing with that the
 

7571
02:08:58,500 --> 02:09:00,410
was very difficult dealing with that the
stress every day looking seeing those

7572
02:09:00,410 --> 02:09:00,420
stress every day looking seeing those
 

7573
02:09:00,420 --> 02:09:03,169
stress every day looking seeing those
losses and after that I kind of decided

7574
02:09:03,169 --> 02:09:03,179
losses and after that I kind of decided
 

7575
02:09:03,179 --> 02:09:04,669
losses and after that I kind of decided
I would never put myself in such a

7576
02:09:04,669 --> 02:09:04,679
I would never put myself in such a
 

7577
02:09:04,679 --> 02:09:06,470
I would never put myself in such a
situation again

7578
02:09:06,470 --> 02:09:06,480
situation again
 

7579
02:09:06,480 --> 02:09:09,169
situation again
um and so that's why like I don't I

7580
02:09:09,169 --> 02:09:09,179
um and so that's why like I don't I
 

7581
02:09:09,179 --> 02:09:10,490
um and so that's why like I don't I
don't do shorting and then separately

7582
02:09:10,490 --> 02:09:10,500
don't do shorting and then separately
 

7583
02:09:10,500 --> 02:09:12,770
don't do shorting and then separately
and I think I post a reply to this

7584
02:09:12,770 --> 02:09:12,780
and I think I post a reply to this
 

7585
02:09:12,780 --> 02:09:15,169
and I think I post a reply to this
comment but in 2021 as Tesla started

if uh something is over inflated
 

7615
02:09:50,400 --> 02:09:52,729
if uh something is over inflated
it's good for there to be an opposing

7616
02:09:52,729 --> 02:09:52,739
it's good for there to be an opposing

like that but it just feels like in our
 

7621
02:09:57,300 --> 02:10:00,290

Tesla I vaguely saw somewhere that's

7624
02:10:02,689 --> 02:10:02,699
Tesla I vaguely saw somewhere that's
 

7625

like the most shorted stock like ever
 

7627
02:10:05,420 --> 02:10:10,129
like the most shorted stock like ever
and so that incentivizes a lot of

02:10:10,129 --> 02:10:10,139
and so that incentivizes a lot of
 

7629
02:10:10,139 --> 02:10:11,950

7631
02:10:11,960 --> 02:10:14,750
um the publication of misinformation
about it like it just feels like the

about it like it just feels like the
 

7633
02:10:14,760 --> 02:10:17,930
about it like it just feels like the
incentives are wrong not when we look at

02:10:17,930 --> 02:10:17,940
incentives are wrong not when we look at
 

7635
02:10:17,940 --> 02:10:20,930
incentives are wrong not when we look at
the markets but at the future of human

02:13:46,739 --> 02:13:48,169
them and then like things that are
really important obviously I'm involved

7850
02:13:48,169 --> 02:13:48,179
really important obviously I'm involved
 

7851
02:13:48,179 --> 02:13:50,470
really important obviously I'm involved
in but I try to do things like that so

7852
02:13:50,470 --> 02:13:50,480
in but I try to do things like that so

streaming is you learn a lot along the
 

7855
02:13:53,400 --> 02:13:55,010
streaming is you learn a lot along the
way and I think now having done that

7856
02:13:55,010 --> 02:13:55,020
way and I think now having done that
 

7857
02:13:55,020 --> 02:13:56,750
way and I think now having done that
there probably are several other

7858
02:13:56,750 --> 02:13:56,760
there probably are several other
 

7859
02:13:56,760 --> 02:13:58,729
there probably are several other
potential careers that I that I could

7860
02:13:58,729 --> 02:13:58,739
potential careers that I that I could
 

7861
02:13:58,739 --> 02:14:00,669
potential careers that I that I could
have if I really wanted to almost about

7862

have if I really wanted to almost about
 

7863
02:14:00,679 --> 02:14:03,589
have if I really wanted to almost about
that uh generalize in terms of what it

7864
02:14:03,589 --> 02:14:03,599
that uh generalize in terms of what it
 

7865
02:14:03,599 --> 02:14:04,669
that uh generalize in terms of what it
takes to build a business from the

successful streamer you have learned
what it takes to start from the ground

7872
02:14:11,930 --> 02:14:11,940
what it takes to start from the ground
 

7873
02:14:11,940 --> 02:14:14,089
what it takes to start from the ground
up with a single person and to build the

7883
02:14:24,179 --> 02:14:25,729
I mean many things I think being a very
strong trustler and having had a

7884
02:14:25,729 --> 02:14:25,739
strong trustler and having had a
 

7885

7886
02:14:28,129 --> 02:14:28,139
following was incredibly important at
 

7887
02:14:28,139 --> 02:14:30,950
following was incredibly important at
the start I think anybody whether it's

7888
02:14:30,950 --> 02:14:30,960
the start I think anybody whether it's
 

7889
02:14:30,960 --> 02:14:32,569
the start I think anybody whether it's
chess or whatever field if you have that

7890
02:14:32,569 --> 02:14:32,579
chess or whatever field if you have that

02:14:36,420 --> 02:14:38,450
career or whatever activity or video
game you do that's already a big step up

7896
02:14:38,450 --> 02:14:38,460
game you do that's already a big step up
 

7897
02:14:38,460 --> 02:14:40,250
game you do that's already a big step up
if you have that to begin with so that

7898
02:14:40,250 --> 02:14:40,260
if you have that to begin with so that
 

7899
02:14:40,260 --> 02:14:41,990
if you have that to begin with so that
definitely played a big role I think

7900
02:14:41,990 --> 02:14:42,000
definitely played a big role I think
 

7901
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:43,910
definitely played a big role I think
more than that though for me it's about

7902
02:14:43,910 --> 02:14:43,920
more than that though for me it's about
 

7903
02:14:43,920 --> 02:14:46,729
more than that though for me it's about
the fans it's about hearing from people

7904
02:14:46,729 --> 02:14:46,739
the fans it's about hearing from people

how they feel I mean there are trolls
 

7907
02:14:48,659 --> 02:14:50,629
how they feel I mean there are trolls

mean I don't know how much you stream

7982
02:15:56,930 --> 02:15:56,940
mean I don't know how much you stream
 

7983
02:15:56,940 --> 02:15:59,450
mean I don't know how much you stream
but it's a lot so day after day after

7984
02:15:59,450 --> 02:15:59,460
but it's a lot so day after day after
 

7985
02:15:59,460 --> 02:16:02,030
but it's a lot so day after day after
day to be able to put that content out

7986
02:16:02,030 --> 02:16:02,040
day to be able to put that content out
 

7987
02:16:02,040 --> 02:16:03,410
day to be able to put that content out
there is there some

7988
02:16:03,410 --> 02:16:03,420
there is there some
 

7989
02:16:03,420 --> 02:16:05,750
there is there some
can you comment on the challenge of that

7990
02:16:05,750 --> 02:16:05,760
can you comment on the challenge of that
 

7991
02:16:05,760 --> 02:16:08,209
can you comment on the challenge of that
and maybe the low points how you're able

7992
02:16:08,209 --> 02:16:08,219
and maybe the low points how you're able
 

7993
02:16:08,219 --> 02:16:11,330
and maybe the low points how you're able
to overcome that I I actually don't fill

7994
02:16:11,330 --> 02:16:11,340
to overcome that I I actually don't fill
 

7995
02:16:11,340 --> 02:16:12,890
to overcome that I I actually don't fill
the lows and I think the main reason

7996
02:16:12,890 --> 02:16:12,900
the lows and I think the main reason
 

7997
02:16:12,900 --> 02:16:14,629
the lows and I think the main reason
that I don't fill lows is because at the

7998
02:16:14,629 --> 02:16:14,639
that I don't fill lows is because at the
 

7999
02:16:14,639 --> 02:16:16,430
that I don't fill lows is because at the
end of the day I've been very fortunate

8000
02:16:16,430 --> 02:16:16,440
end of the day I've been very fortunate
 

8001
02:16:16,440 --> 02:16:18,589

8559
02:25:46,800 --> 02:25:49,010
I've had streaming I think would have
taken much longer to get used to it and

8560
02:25:49,010 --> 02:25:49,020
taken much longer to get used to it and
 

8561
02:25:49,020 --> 02:25:50,330
taken much longer to get used to it and
feel comfortable with it but I already

8562
02:25:50,330 --> 02:25:50,340
feel comfortable with it but I already
 

8563
02:25:50,340 --> 02:25:52,610
feel comfortable with it but I already
had that built-in Advantage

8564
02:25:52,610 --> 02:25:52,620
had that built-in Advantage
 

8565
02:25:52,620 --> 02:25:54,290
had that built-in Advantage
um additionally when I was younger up

8566
02:25:54,290 --> 02:25:54,300
um additionally when I was younger up
 

8567
02:25:54,300 --> 02:25:57,050
um additionally when I was younger up
until I think I was a I was 10 or 11 I

until I think I was a I was 10 or 11 I
 

8569
02:25:57,060 --> 02:25:58,550
until I think I was a I was 10 or 11 I

02:26:01,979 --> 02:26:04,429
didn't have cable so I did not watch TV
Growing Up So I listened to the radio a

8576
02:26:04,429 --> 02:26:04,439
Growing Up So I listened to the radio a
 

8577
02:26:04,439 --> 02:26:05,630
Growing Up So I listened to the radio a
lot I listened to a lot of baseball

8578
02:26:05,630 --> 02:26:05,640
lot I listened to a lot of baseball
 

8579
02:26:05,640 --> 02:26:08,150

games in New York Yankees specifically

8580
02:26:08,150 --> 02:26:08,160
games in New York Yankees specifically
 

8581
02:26:08,160 --> 02:26:09,590
games in New York Yankees specifically
um and so I think by listening to those

8582
02:26:09,590 --> 02:26:09,600
um and so I think by listening to those

of announcers and I think that's also

8586
02:26:13,250 --> 02:26:13,260
of announcers and I think that's also
 

8587
02:26:13,260 --> 02:26:14,809
of announcers and I think that's also
it's one of those things where you learn

8588
02:26:14,809 --> 02:26:14,819
it's one of those things where you learn
 

8589
02:26:14,819 --> 02:26:16,610
it's one of those things where you learn
from what you see kind of when you're

8593
02:26:19,080 --> 02:26:20,929
growing up um they're examples and so I
think that was very very beneficial and

8594
02:26:20,929 --> 02:26:20,939
think that was very very beneficial and
 

8595
02:26:20,939 --> 02:26:22,429
think that was very very beneficial and

8597
02:26:22,439 --> 02:26:23,870
then a third thing
um in terms of like having some flares

8598

was like Middle Ages so he would dress
up and he was sort of like an orator and

8620
02:26:43,550 --> 02:26:43,560
up and he was sort of like an orator and
 

8621
02:26:43,560 --> 02:26:44,929
up and he was sort of like an orator and
he would explain like you know what

happened in the 13 1400s in this sort of
 

8625
02:26:47,100 --> 02:26:48,590
happened in the 13 1400s in this sort of
style and that's also something that

8626
02:26:48,590 --> 02:26:48,600
style and that's also something that
 

8627
02:26:48,600 --> 02:26:50,330

obviously it's not something that I can
consciously like internalize but I think

8630
02:26:52,130 --> 02:26:52,140
consciously like internalize but I think
 

8631
02:26:52,140 --> 02:26:53,510
consciously like internalize but I think
it's something as well that from having

it's something as well that from having
watched those courses and seeing that

um is that it's kind of like you want to
 

8811
02:30:08,520 --> 02:30:10,130
um is that it's kind of like you want to

be secure at a certain point so I've
 

8813
02:30:10,140 --> 02:30:11,809
be secure at a certain point so I've
always looked at that

8814
02:30:11,809 --> 02:30:11,819
always looked at that
 

8815
02:30:11,819 --> 02:30:13,910
always looked at that
um like what is you know how do you get

8816
02:30:13,910 --> 02:30:13,920
um like what is you know how do you get
 

8817

um like what is you know how do you get
to that point at the end of the day

8818
02:30:15,830 --> 02:30:15,840
to that point at the end of the day
 

8819
02:30:15,840 --> 02:30:17,270
to that point at the end of the day
um and and again like I said with my

8820
02:30:17,270 --> 02:30:17,280
um and and again like I said with my
 

8821
02:30:17,280 --> 02:30:19,190
um and and again like I said with my
experiences seeing like actually even

8822
02:30:19,190 --> 02:30:19,200
experiences seeing like actually even
 

8823
02:30:19,200 --> 02:30:20,990
experiences seeing like actually even

um probably works harder than I do
 

8829
02:30:25,380 --> 02:30:26,809
um probably works harder than I do
actually

8830
02:30:26,809 --> 02:30:26,819
actually
 

8831
02:30:26,819 --> 02:30:28,849

8839
02:30:34,080 --> 02:30:36,469
that's that's in large part what led to
it that being said obviously when you

that I'm

8924
02:31:59,230 --> 02:31:59,240
that I'm
 

8925
02:31:59,240 --> 02:32:01,010
that I'm
philosophically intellectually

8926
02:32:01,010 --> 02:32:01,020
philosophically intellectually
 

8927
02:32:01,020 --> 02:32:03,650
philosophically intellectually
spiritually in every way I'm okay with

8928
02:32:03,650 --> 02:32:03,660
spiritually in every way I'm okay with
 

8929
02:32:03,660 --> 02:32:06,230
spiritually in every way I'm okay with
having nothing as close to nothing as

8930
02:32:06,230 --> 02:32:06,240
having nothing as close to nothing as
 

8931
02:32:06,240 --> 02:32:08,750
having nothing as close to nothing as
you can get and the reason I want that

8932
02:32:08,750 --> 02:32:08,760
you can get and the reason I want that
 

8933
02:32:08,760 --> 02:32:11,389
you can get and the reason I want that
is so that I have the freedom to not

8934
02:32:11,389 --> 02:32:11,399
is so that I have the freedom to not
 

8935
02:32:11,399 --> 02:32:13,250
is so that I have the freedom to not
create stability or rather have

8936
02:32:13,250 --> 02:32:13,260
create stability or rather have
 

8937
02:32:13,260 --> 02:32:15,650
create stability or rather have
stability because my bar for stability

8938
02:32:15,650 --> 02:32:15,660
stability because my bar for stability
 

8939
02:32:15,660 --> 02:32:18,050
stability because my bar for stability
is so low and that gives me the freedom

8940
02:32:18,050 --> 02:32:18,060
is so low and that gives me the freedom
 

8941
02:32:18,060 --> 02:32:21,170
is so low and that gives me the freedom
to take big risks and I thought that for

8942
02:32:21,170 --> 02:32:21,180
to take big risks and I thought that for
 

8943
02:32:21,180 --> 02:32:23,330
to take big risks and I thought that for
me I felt like the way I could really

8944
02:32:23,330 --> 02:32:23,340
me I felt like the way I could really
 

8945
02:32:23,340 --> 02:32:24,830
me I felt like the way I could really
help the world

8946
02:32:24,830 --> 02:32:24,840
help the world
 

8947
02:32:24,840 --> 02:32:28,849
help the world
is by optimizing you know the positive I

8948
02:32:28,849 --> 02:32:28,859
is by optimizing you know the positive I
 

8949
02:32:28,859 --> 02:32:30,290
is by optimizing you know the positive I
can do and for that you have to take big

8950
02:32:30,290 --> 02:32:30,300
can do and for that you have to take big
 

8951
02:32:30,300 --> 02:32:35,389
can do and for that you have to take big
risks and big risks really does mean uh

8952
02:32:35,389 --> 02:32:35,399
risks and big risks really does mean uh
 

8953
02:32:35,399 --> 02:32:38,090
risks and big risks really does mean uh
potentially losing everything

8954
02:32:38,090 --> 02:32:38,100
potentially losing everything
 

8955
02:32:38,100 --> 02:32:39,650
potentially losing everything
so you're saying like startups you mean

8956
02:32:39,650 --> 02:32:39,660
so you're saying like startups you mean
 

8957
02:32:39,660 --> 02:32:41,809
so you're saying like startups you mean
like that yeah the startups in every

8958
02:32:41,809 --> 02:32:41,819
like that yeah the startups in every
 

8959
02:32:41,819 --> 02:32:44,830
like that yeah the startups in every
aspect meaning pivoting

8960
02:32:44,830 --> 02:32:44,840
aspect meaning pivoting
 

8961
02:32:44,840 --> 02:32:47,750
aspect meaning pivoting
uh career paths completely when

8962
02:32:47,750 --> 02:32:47,760
uh career paths completely when
 

8963
02:32:47,760 --> 02:32:49,070
uh career paths completely when
everybody else is telling you not

8964
02:32:49,070 --> 02:32:49,080
everybody else is telling you not
 

8965
02:32:49,080 --> 02:32:50,450
everybody else is telling you not
actually you know it's interesting

8966
02:32:50,450 --> 02:32:50,460
actually you know it's interesting
 

8967
02:32:50,460 --> 02:32:51,349
actually you know it's interesting
because like when I think about

8968
02:32:51,349 --> 02:32:51,359
because like when I think about
 

8969
02:32:51,359 --> 02:32:53,870
because like when I think about
streaming it's not like it's not like a

8970
02:32:53,870 --> 02:32:53,880
streaming it's not like it's not like a
 

8971
02:32:53,880 --> 02:32:55,550
streaming it's not like it's not like a
star because like I'm not like investing

8972
02:32:55,550 --> 02:32:55,560
star because like I'm not like investing
 

8973
02:32:55,560 --> 02:32:56,750
star because like I'm not like investing
money where I where I can lose

8974
02:32:56,750 --> 02:32:56,760
money where I where I can lose
 

8975
02:32:56,760 --> 02:32:58,550
money where I where I can lose
everything if it's not successful but it

8976
02:32:58,550 --> 02:32:58,560
everything if it's not successful but it
 

8977
02:32:58,560 --> 02:33:00,410
everything if it's not successful but it
was also a big risk for me doing that

8978
02:33:00,410 --> 02:33:00,420
was also a big risk for me doing that
 

8979
02:33:00,420 --> 02:33:02,210
was also a big risk for me doing that
because at the time I was a professional

8980
02:33:02,210 --> 02:33:02,220
because at the time I was a professional
 

8981
02:33:02,220 --> 02:33:04,550
because at the time I was a professional
player doing very well when I when I

8982
02:33:04,550 --> 02:33:04,560
player doing very well when I when I
 

8983
02:33:04,560 --> 02:33:06,290
player doing very well when I when I
kind of started in October 2018 I was

8984
02:33:06,290 --> 02:33:06,300
kind of started in October 2018 I was
 

8985
02:33:06,300 --> 02:33:07,849
kind of started in October 2018 I was
still top 10 in the world doing very

8986
02:33:07,849 --> 02:33:07,859
still top 10 in the world doing very
 

8987
02:33:07,859 --> 02:33:09,830
still top 10 in the world doing very
well 2019 was actually a very bad year

8988
02:33:09,830 --> 02:33:09,840
well 2019 was actually a very bad year
 

8989
02:33:09,840 --> 02:33:11,929
well 2019 was actually a very bad year
for me I started playing much worse and

8990
02:33:11,929 --> 02:33:11,939
for me I started playing much worse and
 

8991
02:33:11,939 --> 02:33:14,330
for me I started playing much worse and
towards the end of 2019 I was I intended

8992
02:33:14,330 --> 02:33:14,340
towards the end of 2019 I was I intended
 

8993
02:33:14,340 --> 02:33:16,250
towards the end of 2019 I was I intended
to take a six month break last time I

8994
02:33:16,250 --> 02:33:16,260
to take a six month break last time I
 

8995
02:33:16,260 --> 02:33:18,230
to take a six month break last time I
played was November 2019 in India and

8996
02:33:18,230 --> 02:33:18,240
played was November 2019 in India and
 

8997
02:33:18,240 --> 02:33:19,250
played was November 2019 in India and
then I was going to take a break until

8998
02:33:19,250 --> 02:33:19,260
then I was going to take a break until
 

8999
02:33:19,260 --> 02:33:21,290
then I was going to take a break until
the U.S championship in April of 2020.

9000
02:33:21,290 --> 02:33:21,300
the U.S championship in April of 2020.
 

9001
02:33:21,300 --> 02:33:24,349
the U.S championship in April of 2020.
so I did in a sense actually take a risk

9002
02:33:24,349 --> 02:33:24,359
so I did in a sense actually take a risk
 

9003
02:33:24,359 --> 02:33:26,510
so I did in a sense actually take a risk
because I was potentially risking my

9004
02:33:26,510 --> 02:33:26,520
because I was potentially risking my
 

9005
02:33:26,520 --> 02:33:27,650
because I was potentially risking my
career

9006
02:33:27,650 --> 02:33:27,660
career
 

9007
02:33:27,660 --> 02:33:29,330
career
um by spending this extra time that I

9008
02:33:29,330 --> 02:33:29,340
um by spending this extra time that I
 

9009
02:33:29,340 --> 02:33:31,550
um by spending this extra time that I
had streaming so it's not like it's not

9010
02:33:31,550 --> 02:33:31,560
had streaming so it's not like it's not
 

9011
02:33:31,560 --> 02:33:33,050
had streaming so it's not like it's not
the risk where like financially I can

9012
02:33:33,050 --> 02:33:33,060
the risk where like financially I can
 

9013
02:33:33,060 --> 02:33:34,670
the risk where like financially I can
lose everything but it actually was a

9014
02:33:34,670 --> 02:33:34,680
lose everything but it actually was a
 

9015
02:33:34,680 --> 02:33:36,349
lose everything but it actually was a
bit of a risk now now that I think about

9016
02:33:36,349 --> 02:33:36,359
bit of a risk now now that I think about
 

9017
02:33:36,359 --> 02:33:38,030
bit of a risk now now that I think about
it in a sense because if I lose my

9018
02:33:38,030 --> 02:33:38,040
it in a sense because if I lose my
 

9019
02:33:38,040 --> 02:33:40,309
it in a sense because if I lose my
career as a player there's no guarantee

9020
02:33:40,309 --> 02:33:40,319
career as a player there's no guarantee
 

9021
02:33:40,319 --> 02:33:42,410
career as a player there's no guarantee
that streaming is going to be anything

9022
02:33:42,410 --> 02:33:42,420
that streaming is going to be anything
 

9023
02:33:42,420 --> 02:33:44,750
that streaming is going to be anything
anything substantial you didn't think it

9024
02:33:44,750 --> 02:33:44,760
anything substantial you didn't think it
 

9025
02:33:44,760 --> 02:33:46,910
anything substantial you didn't think it
was a risk at the time

9026
02:33:46,910 --> 02:33:46,920
was a risk at the time
 

9027
02:33:46,920 --> 02:33:49,490
was a risk at the time
I think at the time I just I don't know

9028
02:33:49,490 --> 02:33:49,500
I think at the time I just I don't know
 

9029
02:33:49,500 --> 02:33:50,690
I think at the time I just I don't know
I thought it was just something fun to

9030
02:33:50,690 --> 02:33:50,700
I thought it was just something fun to
 

9031
02:33:50,700 --> 02:33:52,849
I thought it was just something fun to
spend my time on I I like I I didn't

9032
02:33:52,849 --> 02:33:52,859
spend my time on I I like I I didn't
 

9033
02:33:52,859 --> 02:33:55,969
spend my time on I I like I I didn't
somehow I don't know I wasn't I figured

9034
02:33:55,969 --> 02:33:55,979
somehow I don't know I wasn't I figured
 

9035
02:33:55,979 --> 02:33:57,290
somehow I don't know I wasn't I figured
that after a six-month break I would

9036
02:33:57,290 --> 02:33:57,300
that after a six-month break I would
 

9037
02:33:57,300 --> 02:33:59,270
that after a six-month break I would
come back and play better chess kind of

9038
02:33:59,270 --> 02:33:59,280
come back and play better chess kind of
 

9039
02:33:59,280 --> 02:34:01,429
come back and play better chess kind of
but like the stream as far as streaming

9040
02:34:01,429 --> 02:34:01,439
but like the stream as far as streaming
 

9041

9042

I never thought of it as being something
 

9043
02:34:02,880 --> 02:34:04,730
I never thought of it as being something
that would be a career something viable

9044
02:34:04,730 --> 02:34:04,740
that would be a career something viable
 

9045
02:34:04,740 --> 02:34:06,469
that would be a career something viable

people you compete against who are
 

9081
02:34:43,859 --> 02:34:45,290
people you compete against who are
friends but at the end of the day it's a

9082
02:34:45,290 --> 02:34:45,300
friends but at the end of the day it's a
 

9083
02:34:45,300 --> 02:34:47,510
friends but at the end of the day it's a
very singular Pursuit it's just you and

02:34:47,510 --> 02:34:47,520
very singular Pursuit it's just you and
 

9085

very singular Pursuit it's just you and
your results dictate everything so there

9086
02:34:50,450 --> 02:34:50,460
your results dictate everything so there
 

9087
02:34:50,460 --> 02:34:52,429
your results dictate everything so there
have been many moments

9088
02:34:52,429 --> 02:34:52,439
have been many moments
 

9089
02:34:52,439 --> 02:34:54,170
have been many moments
um throughout my life when when like

9090
02:34:54,170 --> 02:34:54,180
um throughout my life when when like
 

9091
02:34:54,180 --> 02:34:56,090
um throughout my life when when like
I've struggled I I think probably the

9092
02:34:56,090 --> 02:34:56,100
I've struggled I I think probably the
 

9093
02:34:56,100 --> 02:34:58,790
I've struggled I I think probably the
the biggest uh biggest time when that

9094
02:34:58,790 --> 02:34:58,800
the biggest uh biggest time when that
 

9095
02:34:58,800 --> 02:35:01,250
the biggest uh biggest time when that
happened would have been about 2005 into

9096
02:35:01,250 --> 02:35:01,260
happened would have been about 2005 into
 

9097
02:35:01,260 --> 02:35:04,250
happened would have been about 2005 into
2006 where I stopped playing chess and I

9098
02:35:04,250 --> 02:35:04,260
2006 where I stopped playing chess and I
 

9099
02:35:04,260 --> 02:35:05,450
2006 where I stopped playing chess and I
went to college and that was mainly

9100
02:35:05,450 --> 02:35:05,460
went to college and that was mainly
 

9101
02:35:05,460 --> 02:35:07,670
went to college and that was mainly
because I had gotten to a level where I

9102
02:35:07,670 --> 02:35:07,680
because I had gotten to a level where I
 

9103
02:35:07,680 --> 02:35:10,130
because I had gotten to a level where I
was top 100 in the world but I stagnated

9104
02:35:10,130 --> 02:35:10,140
was top 100 in the world but I stagnated
 

9105
02:35:10,140 --> 02:35:12,650
was top 100 in the world but I stagnated
for that year about 2005 2006 and so I

9106
02:35:12,650 --> 02:35:12,660
for that year about 2005 2006 and so I
 

9107
02:35:12,660 --> 02:35:14,389
for that year about 2005 2006 and so I
decided to go to college primarily

9108
02:35:14,389 --> 02:35:14,399
decided to go to college primarily
 

9109
02:35:14,399 --> 02:35:15,950
decided to go to college primarily
because I had stagnated I didn't feel

9110
02:35:15,950 --> 02:35:15,960
because I had stagnated I didn't feel
 

9111
02:35:15,960 --> 02:35:17,809
because I had stagnated I didn't feel
like I was going anywhere and then also

9112
02:35:17,809 --> 02:35:17,819
like I was going anywhere and then also
 

9113
02:35:17,819 --> 02:35:20,090
like I was going anywhere and then also
kind of being on your own just having a

9114
02:35:20,090 --> 02:35:20,100
kind of being on your own just having a
 

9115
02:35:20,100 --> 02:35:21,290
kind of being on your own just having a
few friends here there in the Chess

9116
02:35:21,290 --> 02:35:21,300
few friends here there in the Chess
 

9117
02:35:21,300 --> 02:35:22,670
few friends here there in the Chess
World you kind of you wonder what it's

9118
02:35:22,670 --> 02:35:22,680
World you kind of you wonder what it's
 

9119
02:35:22,680 --> 02:35:24,590
World you kind of you wonder what it's
like and especially because I was

9120
02:35:24,590 --> 02:35:24,600
like and especially because I was
 

9121
02:35:24,600 --> 02:35:26,330
like and especially because I was
homeschooled as well like that that

9122

homeschooled as well like that that
 

9123
02:35:26,340 --> 02:35:29,150
homeschooled as well like that that
further added to kind of wanting to

02:35:29,150 --> 02:35:29,160
further added to kind of wanting to
 

9125
02:35:29,160 --> 02:35:30,889
further added to kind of wanting to
um be around other people it really

um be around other people it really
played a very big role in in my decision

9128
02:35:33,230 --> 02:35:33,240
played a very big role in in my decision
 

9129
02:35:33,240 --> 02:35:34,849
played a very big role in in my decision
to go to college

9130
02:35:34,849 --> 02:35:34,859
to go to college
 

9131
02:35:34,859 --> 02:35:36,889
to go to college
but at the end of the day as as I

9132
02:35:36,889 --> 02:35:36,899
but at the end of the day as as I
 

9133
02:35:36,899 --> 02:35:38,809
but at the end of the day as as I
realized College kind of was a big

9134
02:35:38,809 --> 02:35:38,819
realized College kind of was a big
 

9135
02:35:38,819 --> 02:35:41,270
realized College kind of was a big
disappointment because the strongest or

9136
02:35:41,270 --> 02:35:41,280
disappointment because the strongest or
 

9137
02:35:41,280 --> 02:35:43,370
disappointment because the strongest or
the biggest strength of playing chess is

9138
02:35:43,370 --> 02:35:43,380
the biggest strength of playing chess is
 

9139
02:35:43,380 --> 02:35:44,809
the biggest strength of playing chess is
that you mingle with people from all

9140
02:35:44,809 --> 02:35:44,819
that you mingle with people from all
 

9141
02:35:44,819 --> 02:35:46,309
that you mingle with people from all
different backgrounds all different ages

9142
02:35:46,309 --> 02:35:46,319
different backgrounds all different ages
 

9143
02:35:46,319 --> 02:35:48,410
different backgrounds all different ages
and when I went to college the the whole

9144
02:35:48,410 --> 02:35:48,420
and when I went to college the the whole
 

9145
02:35:48,420 --> 02:35:49,910
and when I went to college the the whole
notion of basically people who are

9146
02:35:49,910 --> 02:35:49,920
notion of basically people who are
 

9147
02:35:49,920 --> 02:35:51,889
notion of basically people who are
Juniors and seniors being more important

9148
02:35:51,889 --> 02:35:51,899
Juniors and seniors being more important
 

9149
02:35:51,899 --> 02:35:53,990
Juniors and seniors being more important
or more equal than others to do the

9150
02:35:53,990 --> 02:35:54,000
or more equal than others to do the
 

9151
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:55,490
or more equal than others to do the
animal farm line

9152
02:35:55,490 --> 02:35:55,500
animal farm line
 

9153
02:35:55,500 --> 02:35:56,809
animal farm line
um like when you're when you're in that

9154
02:35:56,809 --> 02:35:56,819
um like when you're when you're in that
 

9155
02:35:56,819 --> 02:35:58,790
um like when you're when you're in that
situation it didn't really jive with my

9156
02:35:58,790 --> 02:35:58,800
situation it didn't really jive with my
 

9157
02:35:58,800 --> 02:36:00,469
situation it didn't really jive with my
childhood and growing up in the world of

9158
02:36:00,469 --> 02:36:00,479
childhood and growing up in the world of
 

9159
02:36:00,479 --> 02:36:01,969
childhood and growing up in the world of
Chess and that that is one of the

9160
02:36:01,969 --> 02:36:01,979
Chess and that that is one of the
 

9161
02:36:01,979 --> 02:36:03,590
Chess and that that is one of the
biggest reasons that I actually came

9162
02:36:03,590 --> 02:36:03,600
biggest reasons that I actually came
 

9163
02:36:03,600 --> 02:36:05,570
biggest reasons that I actually came
back to chess because it's like this

9164
02:36:05,570 --> 02:36:05,580
back to chess because it's like this
 

9165
02:36:05,580 --> 02:36:08,090
back to chess because it's like this
world of where certain people can are

9166
02:36:08,090 --> 02:36:08,100
world of where certain people can are
 

9167
02:36:08,100 --> 02:36:10,370
world of where certain people can are
more important like and and things are

9168
02:36:10,370 --> 02:36:10,380
more important like and and things are
 

9169
02:36:10,380 --> 02:36:11,750
more important like and and things are
different like I just could not really

9170
02:36:11,750 --> 02:36:11,760
different like I just could not really
 

9171
02:36:11,760 --> 02:36:13,790
different like I just could not really
relate to that and that was that was one

9172
02:36:13,790 --> 02:36:13,800
relate to that and that was that was one
 

9173
02:36:13,800 --> 02:36:16,309
relate to that and that was that was one
of the biggest reasons it really was

9174
02:36:16,309 --> 02:36:16,319
of the biggest reasons it really was
 

9175
02:36:16,319 --> 02:36:18,110
of the biggest reasons it really was
that wasn't the only reason the other

9176
02:36:18,110 --> 02:36:18,120
that wasn't the only reason the other
 

9177
02:36:18,120 --> 02:36:20,630
that wasn't the only reason the other
reason though was that towards the end

9178
02:36:20,630 --> 02:36:20,640
reason though was that towards the end
 

9179
02:36:20,640 --> 02:36:22,429
reason though was that towards the end
of my first semester I played a term

semester I actually went to play a
tournament uh in Philadelphia because I

9196
02:36:35,570 --> 02:36:35,580

Masters and that kind of made me think

9204
02:36:43,790 --> 02:36:43,800
Masters and that kind of made me think
 

9205
02:36:43,800 --> 02:36:46,309
Masters and that kind of made me think
well okay if if I'm ever going to take a

well okay if if I'm ever going to take a

well okay if if I'm ever going to take a
chance it has to be now if I stay in

02:36:47,750 --> 02:36:47,760
chance it has to be now if I stay in
 

9209
02:36:47,760 --> 02:36:49,670
chance it has to be now if I stay in
college for four years probably got like

9210
02:36:49,670 --> 02:36:49,680
college for four years probably got like
 

9211
02:36:49,680 --> 02:36:51,889
college for four years probably got like
you know probably probably you know got

9212
02:36:51,889 --> 02:36:51,899
you know probably probably you know got
 

9213
02:36:51,899 --> 02:36:53,450
you know probably probably you know got
a major on political science do

9214
02:36:53,450 --> 02:36:53,460
a major on political science do
 

9215
02:36:53,460 --> 02:36:55,790
a major on political science do
something in the political Arena and

9216
02:36:55,790 --> 02:36:55,800
something in the political Arena and
 

9217
02:36:55,800 --> 02:36:57,710
something in the political Arena and
then I felt like I'm gonna probably look

9218
02:36:57,710 --> 02:36:57,720
then I felt like I'm gonna probably look
 

9219
02:36:57,720 --> 02:36:59,570
then I felt like I'm gonna probably look
back like five ten years from now I

9220
02:36:59,570 --> 02:36:59,580
back like five ten years from now I
 

9221
02:36:59,580 --> 02:37:01,849
back like five ten years from now I
wonder what if what if what if like what

9222
02:37:01,849 --> 02:37:01,859
wonder what if what if what if like what
 

9223
02:37:01,859 --> 02:37:03,349
wonder what if what if what if like what
if I had played chess how far could I

9224
02:37:03,349 --> 02:37:03,359
if I had played chess how far could I
 

9225
02:37:03,359 --> 02:37:05,210
if I had played chess how far could I
have gone and if I'd taken those four

9226
02:37:05,210 --> 02:37:05,220
have gone and if I'd taken those four
 

9227
02:37:05,220 --> 02:37:06,410
have gone and if I'd taken those four
years there would have been no

9228
02:37:06,410 --> 02:37:06,420
years there would have been no
 

9229
02:37:06,420 --> 02:37:08,690
years there would have been no
opportunity for me to to reach my full

9230
02:37:08,690 --> 02:37:08,700
opportunity for me to to reach my full
 

9231
02:37:08,700 --> 02:37:10,730
opportunity for me to to reach my full
potential or even see how far I go so

9232
02:37:10,730 --> 02:37:10,740
potential or even see how far I go so
 

9233
02:37:10,740 --> 02:37:12,889
potential or even see how far I go so
therefore that that was um also a big

so supportive of everything I did and I

9436
02:40:46,309 --> 02:40:46,319
so supportive of everything I did and I
 

9437
02:40:46,319 --> 02:40:47,990
so supportive of everything I did and I
think that at the end of the day you

9438
02:40:47,990 --> 02:40:48,000
think that at the end of the day you
 

9439
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:50,870
think that at the end of the day you
have to pursue your passion to whatever

9440
02:40:50,870 --> 02:40:50,880
have to pursue your passion to whatever
 

9441
02:40:50,880 --> 02:40:52,730
have to pursue your passion to whatever
end that might be you might you might

9442
02:40:52,730 --> 02:40:52,740
end that might be you might you might
 

9443
02:40:52,740 --> 02:40:54,590
end that might be you might you might
pursue it you might fail but I do think

9444
02:40:54,590 --> 02:40:54,600
pursue it you might fail but I do think
 

9445
02:40:54,600 --> 02:40:56,210
pursue it you might fail but I do think
you have to pursue it um it's better

9446
02:40:56,210 --> 02:40:56,220
you have to pursue it um it's better
 

9447
02:40:56,220 --> 02:40:57,770
you have to pursue it um it's better
what's it it's better to have tried and

9448
02:40:57,770 --> 02:40:57,780
what's it it's better to have tried and
 

9449
02:40:57,780 --> 02:41:00,050
what's it it's better to have tried and
failed than have not tried at all so I

9450
02:41:00,050 --> 02:41:00,060
failed than have not tried at all so I
 

9451
02:41:00,060 --> 02:41:01,370
failed than have not tried at all so I
really do believe that's the most

9452
02:41:01,370 --> 02:41:01,380
really do believe that's the most
 

9453
02:41:01,380 --> 02:41:03,830
really do believe that's the most
important thing is that you do that

9454
02:41:03,830 --> 02:41:03,840
important thing is that you do that
 

9455
02:41:03,840 --> 02:41:05,510
important thing is that you do that
um and where it takes you who knows but

9456
02:41:05,510 --> 02:41:05,520
um and where it takes you who knows but
 

9457
02:41:05,520 --> 02:41:07,130
um and where it takes you who knows but
the experiences I feel are much more

9458
02:41:07,130 --> 02:41:07,140
the experiences I feel are much more
 

9459
02:41:07,140 --> 02:41:08,929
the experiences I feel are much more
important than than like the what ifs

9460
02:41:08,929 --> 02:41:08,939
important than than like the what ifs
 

9461
02:41:08,939 --> 02:41:10,550
important than than like the what ifs
and possibly missing out on living life

9462
02:41:10,550 --> 02:41:10,560
and possibly missing out on living life
 

9463
02:41:10,560 --> 02:41:13,790
and possibly missing out on living life
so even if it's uh you know everybody

9464
02:41:13,790 --> 02:41:13,800
so even if it's uh you know everybody
 

9465
02:41:13,800 --> 02:41:15,710
so even if it's uh you know everybody
around you and your own judgment says

9466
02:41:15,710 --> 02:41:15,720
around you and your own judgment says

that this is not going to be financially
 

9469

02:42:42,349 --> 02:42:42,359
that's that's probably my general advice
 

9553
02:42:42,359 --> 02:42:43,849
that's that's probably my general advice

it what was that I remember reading us I

9676
02:44:49,849 --> 02:44:49,859
it what was that I remember reading us I
 

9677
02:44:49,859 --> 02:44:51,050
it what was that I remember reading us I
mean it's slightly over there was this

9678
02:44:51,050 --> 02:44:51,060
mean it's slightly over there was this
 

9679
02:44:51,060 --> 02:44:52,550
mean it's slightly over there was this
sci-fi book I read many years ago I

9680
02:44:52,550 --> 02:44:52,560
sci-fi book I read many years ago I
 

9681
02:44:52,560 --> 02:44:54,230
sci-fi book I read many years ago I
think it was rendezvous with Rama

9682
02:44:54,230 --> 02:44:54,240
think it was rendezvous with Rama
 

9683
02:44:54,240 --> 02:44:55,309
think it was rendezvous with Rama
um or I think there were people that

9684
02:44:55,309 --> 02:44:55,319
um or I think there were people that
 

9685
02:44:55,319 --> 02:44:56,929
um or I think there were people that
were just going all over the land like

9686
02:44:56,929 --> 02:44:56,939
were just going all over the land like
 

9687
02:44:56,939 --> 02:44:59,270
were just going all over the land like
in this this cylinder

9688
02:44:59,270 --> 02:44:59,280
in this this cylinder
 

9689
02:44:59,280 --> 02:45:01,070
in this this cylinder
um and so I think for me I've just

9690
02:45:01,070 --> 02:45:01,080
um and so I think for me I've just
 

9691
02:45:01,080 --> 02:45:03,650
um and so I think for me I've just
explore I've just like walk bicycle

9692
02:45:03,650 --> 02:45:03,660
explore I've just like walk bicycle
 

9693

maybe plant plant some uh plant some
trees things of this nature I wonder how

9696
02:45:07,550 --> 02:45:07,560
trees things of this nature I wonder how
 

9697

maybe because I'm doing so many
 

9741
02:45:54,840 --> 02:45:56,150
maybe because I'm doing so many
different things like losing doesn't

9742
02:45:56,150 --> 02:45:56,160
different things like losing doesn't
 

9743
02:45:56,160 --> 02:45:57,950
different things like losing doesn't
have the same effect on me that it that

motivation for streaming is the fact
that at the end of the day no matter how

02:47:18,349 --> 02:47:18,359
I mean I think
 

9825
02:47:18,359 --> 02:47:21,050
I mean I think
again also in terms of Chess I think

9826
02:47:21,050 --> 02:47:21,060
again also in terms of Chess I think
 

9827
02:47:21,060 --> 02:47:22,969
again also in terms of Chess I think
that that it can be as far as just goes

9828
02:47:22,969 --> 02:47:22,979
that that it can be as far as just goes
 

9829
02:47:22,979 --> 02:47:25,070
that that it can be as far as just goes
like or any competition it can be the

9830
02:47:25,070 --> 02:47:25,080
like or any competition it can be the
 

9831
02:47:25,080 --> 02:47:26,270
like or any competition it can be the
greatest thing in the world it can also

9832
02:47:26,270 --> 02:47:26,280
greatest thing in the world it can also
 

9833
02:47:26,280 --> 02:47:27,650
greatest thing in the world it can also
be the worst thing in the world when

9834
02:47:27,650 --> 02:47:27,660
be the worst thing in the world when
 

9835
02:47:27,660 --> 02:47:28,849
be the worst thing in the world when
when you're in love a lot of chess

9836
02:47:28,849 --> 02:47:28,859
when you're in love a lot of chess
 

9837
02:47:28,859 --> 02:47:31,070
when you're in love a lot of chess
players for many it does not help them

9838
02:47:31,070 --> 02:47:31,080
players for many it does not help them
 

9839
02:47:31,080 --> 02:47:32,510
players for many it does not help them
it actually makes them play much worse

9840
02:47:32,510 --> 02:47:32,520
it actually makes them play much worse
 

9841
02:47:32,520 --> 02:47:34,429
it actually makes them play much worse
to us because you you kind of you you

9842
02:47:34,429 --> 02:47:34,439
to us because you you kind of you you
 

9843
02:47:34,439 --> 02:47:37,130
to us because you you kind of you you
don't have that energy or that drive in

9844
02:47:37,130 --> 02:47:37,140
don't have that energy or that drive in
 

9845
02:47:37,140 --> 02:47:38,870
don't have that energy or that drive in
the same kind of way

9846
02:47:38,870 --> 02:47:38,880
the same kind of way
 

9847
02:47:38,880 --> 02:47:41,270
the same kind of way
um so it's it's very mixed for chess as

9848
02:47:41,270 --> 02:47:41,280
um so it's it's very mixed for chess as
 

9849
02:47:41,280 --> 02:47:42,770
um so it's it's very mixed for chess as
far as me personally though I think you

9850
02:47:42,770 --> 02:47:42,780
far as me personally though I think you
 

9851
02:47:42,780 --> 02:47:43,969
