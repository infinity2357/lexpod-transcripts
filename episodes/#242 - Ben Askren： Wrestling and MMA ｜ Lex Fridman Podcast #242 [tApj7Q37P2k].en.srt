um
well there's a thing so the thing i said

98
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:51,040
well there's a thing so the thing i said
 

99
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,630

when i went in to fight him and said we

100
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:52,640
when i went in to fight him and said we
 

101
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,389
when i went in to fight him and said we
don't really maybe he's good maybe he's

102
00:01:54,389 --> 00:01:54,399
don't really maybe he's good maybe he's
 

103
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,389
don't really maybe he's good maybe he's
not we have no we really have no idea to

not we have no we really have no idea to
 

105
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:57,749
not we have no we really have no idea to
this point you know

106
00:01:57,749 --> 00:01:57,759
this point you know
 

107
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,350
this point you know
and so

108
00:01:59,350 --> 00:01:59,360
and so
 

109
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,950
and so
i knew tyrone was a lot better boxing

110
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:00,960
i knew tyrone was a lot better boxing
 

111
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,069
i knew tyrone was a lot better boxing
than i was and so i thought okay tyron's

112
00:02:04,069 --> 00:02:04,079
than i was and so i thought okay tyron's
 

113
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,350
than i was and so i thought okay tyron's
i think it's a good likelihood that

114
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:05,360
i think it's a good likelihood that
 

115
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,429
i think it's a good likelihood that
tyron beats him up

116
00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:07,439
tyron beats him up
 

117
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,510
tyron beats him up
um but there's a chance that jake's kind

118
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:09,520
um but there's a chance that jake's kind
 

119
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,270
um but there's a chance that jake's kind
of good at this and i think that's kind

120
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:11,280
of good at this and i think that's kind
 

121
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,630
of good at this and i think that's kind
of what played out is

122
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:12,640
of what played out is
 

123
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,150

he's kind of good at it even if you saw

124

he's kind of good at it even if you saw
 

125
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,150
he's kind of good at it even if you saw
the way i saw it he still was impressive

126
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:16,160
the way i saw it he still was impressive
 

127
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,150
the way i saw it he still was impressive
in his showing and he's obviously put a

128
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:18,160
in his showing and he's obviously put a
 

129
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,550
in his showing and he's obviously put a
lot of time into it so he's

130
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:20,560
lot of time into it so he's
 

131
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,030

203
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,750
they fight again and again and again
like iterative yeah so i mean i i part

204
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:33,760
like iterative yeah so i mean i i part
 

205
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,030
like iterative yeah so i mean i i part
of the thing is

206
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:35,040
of the thing is
 

207
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,869
of the thing is
okay so jake's corner said you need a

208
00:03:36,869 --> 00:03:36,879
okay so jake's corner said you need a
 

209
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,229
okay so jake's corner said you need a
knockout going into the eighth round

210
00:03:38,229 --> 00:03:38,239
knockout going into the eighth round
 

211
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,630
knockout going into the eighth round
right so i think they thought

212
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:40,640
right so i think they thought
 

213
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,990
right so i think they thought
maybe they're trying to motivate him but

214
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:42,000
maybe they're trying to motivate him but
 

215
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,589
maybe they're trying to motivate him but
i i don't see that way because if they

216
00:03:43,589 --> 00:03:43,599
i i don't see that way because if they
 

217
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,190
i i don't see that way because if they
were actually thought that he was

218
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:45,200
were actually thought that he was
 

219
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,789
were actually thought that he was
winning why would they encourage him to

220
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:46,799
winning why would they encourage him to
 

221
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,630
winning why would they encourage him to
take a dumb risk when tyron has cleared

222
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:48,640
take a dumb risk when tyron has cleared
 

223
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,990
take a dumb risk when tyron has cleared
his knockout power right it's a really

224
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:50,000
his knockout power right it's a really
 

225
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,229
his knockout power right it's a really
stupid coaching philosophy if that's

226
00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:52,239
stupid coaching philosophy if that's
 

227
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:53,509
stupid coaching philosophy if that's
what you're thinking so you obviously

228
00:03:53,509 --> 00:03:53,519
what you're thinking so you obviously
 

229
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:54,710
what you're thinking so you obviously
are thinking hey this is actually in the

230
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:54,720
are thinking hey this is actually in the
 

231
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,630
are thinking hey this is actually in the
balance it's competitive

232
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:56,640
balance it's competitive
 

233
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,190
balance it's competitive
um and i feel like tyron thought maybe

234
00:03:59,190 --> 00:03:59,200
um and i feel like tyron thought maybe
 

235
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,789
um and i feel like tyron thought maybe
he was winning and didn't have the

236
00:04:00,789 --> 00:04:00,799
he was winning and didn't have the
 

237
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,830
he was winning and didn't have the
urgency necessary and so i think he

238
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:03,840
urgency necessary and so i think he
 

239
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,910
urgency necessary and so i think he
there's a chance he turns it up a lot

240
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:05,920
there's a chance he turns it up a lot
 

241
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,670
there's a chance he turns it up a lot
hmm

242

265
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,749
tire if because if tyron can turn up the
pace and nj can't handle it then i think

266
00:04:29,749 --> 00:04:29,759
pace and nj can't handle it then i think
 

267

pace and nj can't handle it then i think
it's an eight one or nine two right um

it's an eight one or nine two right um
if it goes the exact same way and maybe

270
00:04:34,629 --> 00:04:34,639
if it goes the exact same way and maybe
 

271
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:35,990
if it goes the exact same way and maybe

00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,269
i think the interesting thing would be
if i would have stuck around right so i

826
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:19,279
if i would have stuck around right so i

00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,390
lose like you said right but on this
other hand you have to have

1566
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:04,400
other hand you have to have
 

1567
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,750
other hand you have to have
someone who seeks out challenges right

1568
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:07,760
someone who seeks out challenges right
 

1569
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,789
someone who seeks out challenges right
because if you don't have that you're

1570
00:25:08,789 --> 00:25:08,799
because if you don't have that you're
 

1571
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:09,990
because if you don't have that you're
never gonna reach your full potential

00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:10,000
never gonna reach your full potential
 

1573
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,669
never gonna reach your full potential
either and so you have to balance these

1574
00:25:11,669 --> 00:25:11,679
either and so you have to balance these
 

1575
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:12,870
either and so you have to balance these
two balls

two balls
 

1577
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,110

yeah so what happened for people who
don't know you went in for a double leg

2026
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:18,720
don't know you went in for a double leg
 

2027
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,909
don't know you went in for a double leg
and he went

2028
00:32:19,909 --> 00:32:19,919
and he went
 

2029
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:21,750
and he went
he did a flying knee and then and and

2030
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:21,760
he did a flying knee and then and and
 

2031
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,350
he did a flying knee and then and and
the weight caught you well specifically

2032
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:23,360
the weight caught you well specifically
 

2033
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,029
the weight caught you well specifically
the way he did that knee was kind of

2034
00:32:25,029 --> 00:32:25,039
the way he did that knee was kind of
 

2035
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:26,470
the way he did that knee was kind of
different than the way anyone had thrown

2036
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:26,480
different than the way anyone had thrown
 

2037
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,269
different than the way anyone had thrown
flying knees before most people go more

2038
00:32:29,269 --> 00:32:29,279
flying knees before most people go more
 

2039
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:30,870
flying knees before most people go more
just from a stand straight vertical

2040
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:30,880
just from a stand straight vertical
 

2041
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,110
just from a stand straight vertical
whereas he took a few like running steps

2042
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:33,120
whereas he took a few like running steps
 

2043
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,509
whereas he took a few like running steps
and went more you know the trajectory of

2044
00:32:35,509 --> 00:32:35,519
and went more you know the trajectory of
 

2045
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:37,750
and went more you know the trajectory of
the angle was different um so i think

2046
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:37,760
the angle was different um so i think
 

2047
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,590
the angle was different um so i think
that's kind of probably why it caught

2048
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:39,600
that's kind of probably why it caught
 

2049
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,470
that's kind of probably why it caught
you know

2050
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:40,480
you know
 

2051
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,470
you know
i think a lot of things in combat well

2052
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:42,480
i think a lot of things in combat well
 

2053
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,830
i think a lot of things in combat well
probably everything but i focus

2054
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:43,840
probably everything but i focus
 

2055
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,029
probably everything but i focus

maybe there's a chance but probably not
 

2717
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,270
maybe there's a chance but probably not
because this is not their special day so

2718
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:01,280
because this is not their special day so
 

2719
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,109
because this is not their special day so
for people who don't know the eddie uh

2720
00:43:03,109 --> 00:43:03,119
for people who don't know the eddie uh
 

2721
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:05,349
for people who don't know the eddie uh
eddie bravo thing is uh

2722
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:05,359
eddie bravo thing is uh
 

2723
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:07,910
eddie bravo thing is uh
when it goes into overtime you get a

2724
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:07,920
when it goes into overtime you get a
 

2725
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,069
when it goes into overtime you get a
dominance position on a person and you

2726
00:43:10,069 --> 00:43:10,079
dominance position on a person and you
 

2727
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:11,670
dominance position on a person and you
get to yeah basically put them in a

2728
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:11,680
get to yeah basically put them in a
 

2729
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,030
get to yeah basically put them in a
cradle this is the wrestling equivalent

2730
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:13,040
cradle this is the wrestling equivalent
 

2731
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,430
cradle this is the wrestling equivalent
yeah but you uh take their back maybe

2732
00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:15,440
yeah but you uh take their back maybe
 

2733
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,589
yeah but you uh take their back maybe
yeah like a wrestling arm bar yeah and i

2734
00:43:17,589 --> 00:43:17,599
yeah like a wrestling arm bar yeah and i
 

2735
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:18,710
yeah like a wrestling arm bar yeah and i
don't think that's very fair because if

2736
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:18,720
don't think that's very fair because if
 

2737
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,150
don't think that's very fair because if
someone whoops your ass they whip your

2738
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:20,160
someone whoops your ass they whip your
 

2739
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,390
someone whoops your ass they whip your
ass and then you know and so i think the

2740
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:22,400
ass and then you know and so i think the
 

2741
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,390
ass and then you know and so i think the
reason why jujitsu people accept that

2742
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:24,400
reason why jujitsu people accept that
 

2743
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,390
reason why jujitsu people accept that
rule set is that i don't think

2744
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:26,400
rule set is that i don't think
 

2745
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,750
rule set is that i don't think
i think they know this but would admit

2746
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:27,760
i think they know this but would admit
 

2747
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:28,870
i think they know this but would admit
it i don't think they're their point

2748
00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:28,880
it i don't think they're their point
 

2749
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,870
it i don't think they're their point
scoring system ad include adding

2750
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:30,880
scoring system ad include adding
 

2751
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,910
scoring system ad include adding
adequately rewards what people value so

2752
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:33,920
adequately rewards what people value so
 

2753
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:36,309
adequately rewards what people value so
like in wrestling we value takedowns

2754
00:43:36,309 --> 00:43:36,319
like in wrestling we value takedowns
 

2755
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:38,069
like in wrestling we value takedowns
because it gets closer to the pin and

2756
00:43:38,069 --> 00:43:38,079
because it gets closer to the pin and
 

2757
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:40,630
because it gets closer to the pin and
the most valuable scoring is a near

2758
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:40,640
the most valuable scoring is a near
 

2759
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,950
the most valuable scoring is a near
fault near to the pin because that's the

2760
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:42,960
fault near to the pin because that's the
 

2761
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,030
fault near to the pin because that's the
ultimate goal to sport whereas in jiu

2762
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:45,040
ultimate goal to sport whereas in jiu
 

2763
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,190
ultimate goal to sport whereas in jiu
jitsu for example like if i were to get

2764
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:47,200
jitsu for example like if i were to get
 

2765
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,510
jitsu for example like if i were to get
a takedown uh so like if i went to

2766
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:49,520
a takedown uh so like if i went to
 

2767
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,430
a takedown uh so like if i went to
gordon ryan and he just didn't pull

2768
00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:51,440
gordon ryan and he just didn't pull
 

2769
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,990
gordon ryan and he just didn't pull
guard i would probably get the takedown

2770
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:54,000
guard i would probably get the takedown
 

2771
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,150
guard i would probably get the takedown
now if somehow he didn't submit me which

2772
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:56,160
now if somehow he didn't submit me which
 

2773
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,670
now if somehow he didn't submit me which
he probably would right but say he got

2774
00:43:57,670 --> 00:43:57,680
he probably would right but say he got
 

2775
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,270
he probably would right but say he got
got close to like 12 submissions but

2776
00:43:59,270 --> 00:43:59,280
got close to like 12 submissions but
 

2777
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,589
got close to like 12 submissions but
somehow i slipped out of all of them

2778
00:44:01,589 --> 00:44:01,599
somehow i slipped out of all of them
 

2779
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:03,750
somehow i slipped out of all of them
now i win 2-0 like that's ridiculous

2780
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:03,760
now i win 2-0 like that's ridiculous
 

2781
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,190
now i win 2-0 like that's ridiculous
like he should very clearly win because

2782
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:05,200
like he should very clearly win because
 

2783
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,309
like he should very clearly win because
he almost submitted you know what i'm

2784
00:44:06,309 --> 00:44:06,319
he almost submitted you know what i'm
 

2785
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:07,430
he almost submitted you know what i'm
saying like

2786
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:07,440
saying like
 

2787
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,950
saying like
there and i and i realized the

2788
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:08,960
there and i and i realized the
 

2789
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,870
there and i and i realized the
difficulty i realized the difficulty in

2790
00:44:10,870 --> 00:44:10,880
difficulty i realized the difficulty in
 

2791
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,910
difficulty i realized the difficulty in
rewarding near submissions but that is

2792
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:13,920
rewarding near submissions but that is
 

2793

the most valuable thing is getting close
 

2795
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,589
the most valuable thing is getting close
to finishing the match and in most

2796
00:44:17,589 --> 00:44:17,599
to finishing the match and in most
 

2797
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:19,349
to finishing the match and in most
competitions they don't actually reward

2798
00:44:19,349 --> 00:44:19,359
competitions they don't actually reward
 

2799
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:20,069
competitions they don't actually reward
that

2800
00:44:20,069 --> 00:44:20,079

some point um
 

2819
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:38,150
some point um
then someone would just have to fall

2820
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:38,160
then someone would just have to fall
 

2821
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,910

up the longest you honestly don't think

2826
00:44:45,109 --> 00:44:45,119
up the longest you honestly don't think

kyle day going against you for 30
minutes so it's going to be kind of

2834
00:44:52,309 --> 00:44:52,319
minutes so it's going to be kind of
 

2835
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:53,990
minutes so it's going to be kind of
boring um

2836
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:54,000
boring um
 

2837
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,309
boring um
for the most part

action for 30 minutes so i i relate to

2846
00:45:03,349 --> 00:45:03,359
action for 30 minutes so i i relate to
 

2847
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,870
action for 30 minutes so i i relate to
because some of my kids when when

2848
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:04,880
because some of my kids when when
 

2849

i can't do that for seven minutes and
 

2857
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,390
i can't do that for seven minutes and
i'm like well you know like say if i had

2858
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:12,400
i'm like well you know like say if i had
 

2859
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:13,349
i'm like well you know like say if i had
you do

2860
00:45:13,349 --> 00:45:13,359
you do
 

2861
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:14,150
you do
uh

2862
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:14,160
uh
 

2863
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,910
uh
hang cleans at a relatively heavy weight

2864
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:15,920
hang cleans at a relatively heavy weight
 

2865
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,030
hang cleans at a relatively heavy weight
as hard as you could you're not gonna

2866
00:45:17,030 --> 00:45:17,040
as hard as you could you're not gonna
 

2867
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,790
as hard as you could you're not gonna
last seven minutes you're gonna your

2868
00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:18,800
last seven minutes you're gonna your
 

2869
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,190
last seven minutes you're gonna your
pace will slow down right so my thing is

2870
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:21,200
pace will slow down right so my thing is
 

2871
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,630
pace will slow down right so my thing is
like well your pace doesn't have to step

2872
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:22,640
like well your pace doesn't have to step
 

2873
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:23,510
like well your pace doesn't have to step
here because i'm wrestling you're

2874
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:23,520
here because i'm wrestling you're
 

2875
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,750
here because i'm wrestling you're
competing at someone so if you're here

2876
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:25,760
competing at someone so if you're here
 

2877
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,829
competing at someone so if you're here
at 100 and you go to 80 but they go to

2878
00:45:27,829 --> 00:45:27,839
at 100 and you go to 80 but they go to
 

2879
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:29,910
at 100 and you go to 80 but they go to
70 that's great and then you go to 60

2880
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:29,920
70 that's great and then you go to 60
 

2881
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,470
70 that's great and then you go to 60
but they go to 40. this is even better

2882
00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:32,480
but they go to 40. this is even better
 

2883
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,630
but they go to 40. this is even better
right because the gap is growing so we

2884
00:45:34,630 --> 00:45:34,640
right because the gap is growing so we
 

2885
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,230
right because the gap is growing so we
don't necessarily if we get tired that's

2886
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:36,240
don't necessarily if we get tired that's
 

2887
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,990
don't necessarily if we get tired that's
fine if they get more tired that's

2888
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:38,000
fine if they get more tired that's
 

2889
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,069
fine if they get more tired that's
better so i think most people would know

2890
00:45:40,069 --> 00:45:40,079
better so i think most people would know
 

2891
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:41,430
better so i think most people would know
that so they would

2892
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:41,440
that so they would
 

2893
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,870
that so they would
kind of slow it down

2894
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:44,880

 

2895
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,390

but yeah i think it's third a third i

2896
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:46,400
but yeah i think it's third a third i
 

2897
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,990
but yeah i think it's third a third i
mean i've wrestled 30 minute goes i've

2898
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:48,000
mean i've wrestled 30 minute goes i've
 

2899
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,510
mean i've wrestled 30 minute goes i've
wrestled six months i've wrestled hour

2900
00:45:49,510 --> 00:45:49,520
wrestled six months i've wrestled hour
 

2901
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,069
wrestled six months i've wrestled hour
long goes um you're not gonna get so

2902
00:45:52,069 --> 00:45:52,079
long goes um you're not gonna get so
 

2903
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:53,430
long goes um you're not gonna get so
tired you're gonna fall over in that

2904
00:45:53,430 --> 00:45:53,440
tired you're gonna fall over in that
 

2905
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,190
tired you're gonna fall over in that
time period but at some point if it's

2906
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:55,200
time period but at some point if it's
 

2907
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,349
time period but at some point if it's
unlimited someone will get so tired that

2908
00:45:57,349 --> 00:45:57,359
unlimited someone will get so tired that
 

2909
00:45:57,359 --> 00:45:59,030
unlimited someone will get so tired that
or dehydrated that they're just gonna

2910
00:45:59,030 --> 00:45:59,040
or dehydrated that they're just gonna
 

2911
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:02,550
or dehydrated that they're just gonna
freaking fall over yeah but you think

2912
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:02,560
freaking fall over yeah but you think
 

2913
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,230
freaking fall over yeah but you think
what about making it exciting and

2914
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:04,240
what about making it exciting and
 

2915
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,150
what about making it exciting and
dynamic

2916
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:06,160
dynamic
 

2917
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,069
dynamic
you think the other person is always

2918
00:46:08,069 --> 00:46:08,079
you think the other person is always
 

2919
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:09,670
you think the other person is always
going to be going for the pin

2920
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:09,680
going to be going for the pin
 

2921
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,750
going to be going for the pin
and thereby make a dynamic well if

2922
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:11,760
and thereby make a dynamic well if
 

2923
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:12,950
and thereby make a dynamic well if
they're working that hard then they

2924
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:12,960
they're working that hard then they
 

2925
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,270
they're working that hard then they
might exhaust themselves right right and

2926
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:15,280
might exhaust themselves right right and
 

2927
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,030
might exhaust themselves right right and
and obviously then if you're if you're

2928
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:17,040
and obviously then if you're if you're
 

2929
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,950
and obviously then if you're if you're
being that dynamic then you're adding

2930
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:18,960
being that dynamic then you're adding
 

2931
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,109
being that dynamic then you're adding
risk to yourself too because you are you

2932
00:46:21,109 --> 00:46:21,119
risk to yourself too because you are you
 

2933
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:23,589
risk to yourself too because you are you
know doing that well i love this this is

2934
00:46:23,589 --> 00:46:23,599
know doing that well i love this this is
 

2935
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:25,589
know doing that well i love this this is
a great idea

2936
00:46:25,589 --> 00:46:25,599
a great idea
 

2937
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:27,510
a great idea
well i figured i'd get i rack up like 20

2938
00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:27,520
well i figured i'd get i rack up like 20
 

2939
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,670
well i figured i'd get i rack up like 20
pins against bums you know or not not as

2940
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:29,680
pins against bums you know or not not as
 

2941
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,030
pins against bums you know or not not as
great people in the beginning and then i

2942
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:31,040
great people in the beginning and then i
 

2943
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,790
great people in the beginning and then i
would start bringing in better people

2944
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:32,800
would start bringing in better people
 

2945
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,309
would start bringing in better people
because they would be enticed by you

2946
00:46:34,309 --> 00:46:34,319
because they would be enticed by you
 

2947
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:35,829
because they would be enticed by you

i actually think sometimes think i
 

3573
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:20,870
i actually think sometimes think i
wouldn't have smartphones because i may

3574
00:56:20,870 --> 00:56:20,880
wouldn't have smartphones because i may
 

3575
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:23,109
wouldn't have smartphones because i may
have been distracted by my smartphone

have been distracted by my smartphone
 

3577
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:24,309
have been distracted by my smartphone
maybe i wouldn't have been selling so

3578
00:56:24,309 --> 00:56:24,319
maybe i wouldn't have been selling so
 

3579
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:25,990
maybe i wouldn't have been selling so
obsessed but maybe but you know some

maybe they were finishing on me you know

3586
00:56:31,829 --> 00:56:31,839
maybe they were finishing on me you know

maybe they were finishing on me you know
they go home and i just [\h__\h] obsessed

3588
00:56:34,150 --> 00:56:34,160
they go home and i just [\h__\h] obsessed
 

3589
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:36,630
they go home and i just [\h__\h] obsessed
about that one position like okay how do

3590
00:56:36,630 --> 00:56:36,640
about that one position like okay how do
 

3591
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:39,109
about that one position like okay how do
what what am i missing here and and not

3592
00:56:39,109 --> 00:56:39,119
what what am i missing here and and not
 

3593
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:40,950
what what am i missing here and and not
just accepting like that whatever the

3594
00:56:40,950 --> 00:56:40,960
just accepting like that whatever the
 

3595
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:42,950
just accepting like that whatever the
coach says is the answer but like what

3596
00:56:42,950 --> 00:56:42,960
coach says is the answer but like what
 

3597
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:45,430
coach says is the answer but like what
am i missing what ways can my body move

3598
00:56:45,430 --> 00:56:45,440
am i missing what ways can my body move
 

3599
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:48,309
am i missing what ways can my body move
that no one's told me it can move yet

3600
00:56:48,309 --> 00:56:48,319
that no one's told me it can move yet
 

3601
00:56:48,319 --> 00:56:50,470
that no one's told me it can move yet
where can my arms go right where can i

3602
00:56:50,470 --> 00:56:50,480
where can my arms go right where can i
 

3603
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:51,910
where can my arms go right where can i
do all these things and so i would just

3604
00:56:51,910 --> 00:56:51,920
do all these things and so i would just
 

3605
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:54,150
do all these things and so i would just
obsess about these things and then you

3606
00:56:54,150 --> 00:56:54,160
obsess about these things and then you
 

3607
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,270
obsess about these things and then you
know sometimes you come in the next day

3608
00:56:55,270 --> 00:56:55,280
know sometimes you come in the next day
 

3609
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:57,829
know sometimes you come in the next day
you say oh well maybe this you know and

3610
00:56:57,829 --> 00:56:57,839
you say oh well maybe this you know and
 

3611
00:56:57,839 --> 00:56:59,349
you say oh well maybe this you know and
maybe it works maybe it doesn't maybe it

3612
00:56:59,349 --> 00:56:59,359
maybe it works maybe it doesn't maybe it
 

3613
00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:00,630
maybe it works maybe it doesn't maybe it
works twice and it doesn't work the next

3614
00:57:00,630 --> 00:57:00,640
works twice and it doesn't work the next
 

3615
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:02,069
works twice and it doesn't work the next
time and so you kind of like have this

3616
00:57:02,069 --> 00:57:02,079
time and so you kind of like have this
 

3617
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:04,150
time and so you kind of like have this
creative process and it's like

3618
00:57:04,150 --> 00:57:04,160
creative process and it's like
 

3619
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:05,109
creative process and it's like
there's a lot of things that are on the

3620
00:57:05,109 --> 00:57:05,119
there's a lot of things that are on the
 

3621
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:06,789
there's a lot of things that are on the
cutting room floor that never made it to

3622
00:57:06,789 --> 00:57:06,799
cutting room floor that never made it to
 

3623
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:08,390
cutting room floor that never made it to
the the light because you thought they'd

3624
00:57:08,390 --> 00:57:08,400
the the light because you thought they'd
 

3625
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,230
the the light because you thought they'd
be good and they failed and they sucked

3626
00:57:10,230 --> 00:57:10,240
be good and they failed and they sucked
 

3627
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:11,589
be good and they failed and they sucked
and then you know to the point where

3628
00:57:11,589 --> 00:57:11,599
and then you know to the point where
 

3629
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:14,710
and then you know to the point where
like my senior year um

3630
00:57:14,710 --> 00:57:14,720
like my senior year um
 

3631
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:16,630
like my senior year um
i got to this point where the the people

3632
00:57:16,630 --> 00:57:16,640
i got to this point where the the people
 

3633
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:18,390
i got to this point where the the people
then they were just figures figures

3634
00:57:18,390 --> 00:57:18,400
then they were just figures figures
 

3635
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,390
then they were just figures figures
would wrestle in my head about positions

3636
00:57:20,390 --> 00:57:20,400
would wrestle in my head about positions
 

3637
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:21,670
would wrestle in my head about positions
i was thinking about i wouldn't tell

3638
00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:21,680
i was thinking about i wouldn't tell
 

3639
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:23,349
i was thinking about i wouldn't tell
them what to do they would just

3640
00:57:23,349 --> 00:57:23,359
them what to do they would just
 

3641
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:24,789
them what to do they would just
they would go in my head and then like

3642
00:57:24,789 --> 00:57:24,799
they would go in my head and then like
 

3643
00:57:24,799 --> 00:57:27,430
they would go in my head and then like
something oh [\h__\h] wait that's it that

3644
00:57:27,430 --> 00:57:27,440
something oh [\h__\h] wait that's it that
 

3645
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:29,190
something oh [\h__\h] wait that's it that
that's it that just happened that's the

3646
00:57:29,190 --> 00:57:29,200
that's it that just happened that's the
 

3647
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,630
that's it that just happened that's the
move and then i go try to practice and

3648
00:57:30,630 --> 00:57:30,640
move and then i go try to practice and
 

3649
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:32,710
move and then i go try to practice and
sure enough boom that's the move that's

3650
00:57:32,710 --> 00:57:32,720
sure enough boom that's the move that's
 

3651
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:34,549
sure enough boom that's the move that's
exactly what you have alpha zero playing

3652
00:57:34,549 --> 00:57:34,559
exactly what you have alpha zero playing
 

3653
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:36,470
exactly what you have alpha zero playing
learning chess you have uh

3654
00:57:36,470 --> 00:57:36,480
learning chess you have uh
 

3655
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:39,030
learning chess you have uh
oh no it's called self plays uh you have

3656
00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:39,040
oh no it's called self plays uh you have
 

3657
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:42,870
oh no it's called self plays uh you have
uh what did the figures have um

3658
00:57:42,870 --> 00:57:42,880
uh what did the figures have um
 

3659
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:45,109
uh what did the figures have um
like no faces they were just like did

3660
00:57:45,109 --> 00:57:45,119
like no faces they were just like did
 

3661
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:46,870
like no faces they were just like did
they have a human form or is it just

3662
00:57:46,870 --> 00:57:46,880
they have a human form or is it just
 

3663
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,430
they have a human form or is it just
like stick figures essentially oh there

3664
00:57:49,430 --> 00:57:49,440
like stick figures essentially oh there
 

3665
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:50,710
like stick figures essentially oh there
was not like yeah it was not like humans

3666
00:57:50,710 --> 00:57:50,720
was not like yeah it was not like humans
 

3667
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:52,069
was not like yeah it was not like humans
it was more like stick fig it wouldn't

3668
00:57:52,069 --> 00:57:52,079
it was more like stick fig it wouldn't
 

3669
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:54,390
it was more like stick fig it wouldn't
stick figures exactly like they were uh

3670
00:57:54,390 --> 00:57:54,400
stick figures exactly like they were uh
 

3671
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,630
stick figures exactly like they were uh
so they had some volume yeah it was like

3672
00:57:56,630 --> 00:57:56,640
so they had some volume yeah it was like
 

3673
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:58,470
so they had some volume yeah it was like
it was like a gray person and they had

3674
00:57:58,470 --> 00:57:58,480
it was like a gray person and they had
 

3675
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:00,309
it was like a gray person and they had
you know three dimensions essentially

3676
00:58:00,309 --> 00:58:00,319
you know three dimensions essentially
 

3677
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:01,670
you know three dimensions essentially
because i had to see how the things

3678
00:58:01,670 --> 00:58:01,680
because i had to see how the things
 

3679
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:03,030
because i had to see how the things
moved and

3680
00:58:03,030 --> 00:58:03,040
moved and
 

3681
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:04,950
moved and
yeah

3682
00:58:04,950 --> 00:58:04,960
yeah
 

3683
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:07,589
yeah
uh i mean this is exactly what uh open

3684
00:58:07,589 --> 00:58:07,599
uh i mean this is exactly what uh open
 

3685
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:10,789
uh i mean this is exactly what uh open
ai and uh demand at google or uh

3686
00:58:10,789 --> 00:58:10,799
ai and uh demand at google or uh
 

3687
00:58:10,799 --> 00:58:12,309
ai and uh demand at google or uh
i don't know if you've seen

3688
00:58:12,309 --> 00:58:12,319
i don't know if you've seen
 

3689
00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:13,270
i don't know if you've seen
but there's something called

3690
00:58:13,270 --> 00:58:13,280
but there's something called
 

3691
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:14,870
but there's something called
reinforcement learning in artificial

3692
00:58:14,870 --> 00:58:14,880
reinforcement learning in artificial
 

3693
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:16,150
reinforcement learning in artificial
intelligence where

3694
00:58:16,150 --> 00:58:16,160
intelligence where
 

3695
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:17,910
intelligence where
you have like they've done it for like

3696
00:58:17,910 --> 00:58:17,920
you have like they've done it for like
 

3697
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:21,270
you have like they've done it for like
sumo wrestling you have you have like

3698
00:58:21,270 --> 00:58:21,280
sumo wrestling you have you have like
 

3699
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:23,109
sumo wrestling you have you have like
you have these two stick figures that

3700
00:58:23,109 --> 00:58:23,119
you have these two stick figures that
 

3701
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:25,990
you have these two stick figures that
don't even know how to get up at first

3702
00:58:25,990 --> 00:58:26,000
don't even know how to get up at first
 

3703
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,270
don't even know how to get up at first
and they figure out how to stand on

3704
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:27,280
and they figure out how to stand on
 

3705
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:28,549
and they figure out how to stand on
their two feet

3706
00:58:28,549 --> 00:58:28,559
their two feet
 

3707
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:30,470
their two feet
and then they figure out how to push the

3708
00:58:30,470 --> 00:58:30,480
and then they figure out how to push the
 

3709
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:32,710
and then they figure out how to push the
other person off of the the

3710
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:32,720
other person off of the the
 

3711
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:34,230
other person off of the the
pedestal wait so

3712
00:58:34,230 --> 00:58:34,240
pedestal wait so
 

3713
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:36,069
pedestal wait so
but what about like uh when you look at

3714
00:58:36,069 --> 00:58:36,079
but what about like uh when you look at
 

3715
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:38,069
but what about like uh when you look at
the the boston dynamics sometimes they

3716
00:58:38,069 --> 00:58:38,079
the the boston dynamics sometimes they
 

3717
00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:39,910
the the boston dynamics sometimes they
have trouble with like jumping and

3718
00:58:39,910 --> 00:58:39,920
have trouble with like jumping and
 

3719
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:41,990
have trouble with like jumping and
balancing and other stuff so are they

3720
00:58:41,990 --> 00:58:42,000
balancing and other stuff so are they
 

3721
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,589
balancing and other stuff so are they
are they doing that same program or no

3722
00:58:43,589 --> 00:58:43,599
are they doing that same program or no
 

3723
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:46,470
are they doing that same program or no
no no no this different the the

3724
00:58:46,470 --> 00:58:46,480
no no no this different the the
 

3725
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:48,710
no no no this different the the
everything boston dynamics is doing

3726
00:58:48,710 --> 00:58:48,720
everything boston dynamics is doing
 

3727
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:52,150
everything boston dynamics is doing
is hard-coded so it's not

3728
00:58:52,150 --> 00:58:52,160
is hard-coded so it's not
 

3729
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:55,030
is hard-coded so it's not
it's not learning the

3730
00:58:55,030 --> 00:58:55,040
it's not learning the
 

3731
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:56,630
it's not learning the
all the sophisticated movements and

3732
00:58:56,630 --> 00:58:56,640
all the sophisticated movements and
 

3733
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:58,390
all the sophisticated movements and
strategies like high-level strategies

3734
00:58:58,390 --> 00:58:58,400
strategies like high-level strategies
 

3735
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,150
strategies like high-level strategies
and movement that's all

3736
00:59:00,150 --> 00:59:00,160
and movement that's all
 

3737
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:01,670
and movement that's all
something that boston dynamics does not

3738
00:59:01,670 --> 00:59:01,680
something that boston dynamics does not
 

3739
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:03,430
something that boston dynamics does not
do and if it does it like the parkour

3740
00:59:03,430 --> 00:59:03,440
do and if it does it like the parkour
 

3741
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:06,230
do and if it does it like the parkour
stuff that's all hard-coded in oh

3742
00:59:06,230 --> 00:59:06,240
stuff that's all hard-coded in oh
 

3743
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:08,789
stuff that's all hard-coded in oh
the people like project and think like

3744
00:59:08,789 --> 00:59:08,799
the people like project and think like
 

3745
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:09,589
the people like project and think like
these

3746
00:59:09,589 --> 00:59:09,599
these
 

3747
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:11,829
these
robots have like discovered

3748
00:59:11,829 --> 00:59:11,839
robots have like discovered
 

3749
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:13,990
robots have like discovered
like how to move in sophisticated ways

3750
00:59:13,990 --> 00:59:14,000
like how to move in sophisticated ways
 

3751
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,829
like how to move in sophisticated ways
they haven't well that's what when you

3752
00:59:15,829 --> 00:59:15,839
they haven't well that's what when you
 

3753
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:18,470
they haven't well that's what when you
and john were talking about the the

3754
00:59:18,470 --> 00:59:18,480
and john were talking about the the
 

3755
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:20,789
and john were talking about the the
grappling robot yeah i mean the one

3756
00:59:20,789 --> 00:59:20,799
grappling robot yeah i mean the one
 

3757
00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:23,510
grappling robot yeah i mean the one
thing i was i was obsessing about in my

3758
00:59:23,510 --> 00:59:23,520
thing i was i was obsessing about in my
 

3759
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:25,589
thing i was i was obsessing about in my
head is that

3760
00:59:25,589 --> 00:59:25,599
head is that
 

3761
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:27,589
head is that
with the chest right if a chess piece

3762
00:59:27,589 --> 00:59:27,599
with the chest right if a chess piece
 

3763
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:29,430
with the chest right if a chess piece
moves right uh the horse can move like

3764
00:59:29,430 --> 00:59:29,440
moves right uh the horse can move like
 

3765
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:31,190
moves right uh the horse can move like
an l right

3766
00:59:31,190 --> 00:59:31,200
an l right
 

3767
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,710
an l right
it can only move like an l it doesn't

3768
00:59:32,710 --> 00:59:32,720
it can only move like an l it doesn't
 

3769
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:34,549
it can only move like an l it doesn't
matter if it moves at two meters per

3770
00:59:34,549 --> 00:59:34,559
matter if it moves at two meters per
 

3771
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:36,789
matter if it moves at two meters per
second or seven meters per second it can

3772
00:59:36,789 --> 00:59:36,799
second or seven meters per second it can
 

3773
00:59:36,799 --> 00:59:38,470
second or seven meters per second it can
only it can only move there right

3774
00:59:38,470 --> 00:59:38,480
only it can only move there right
 

3775
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:40,870
only it can only move there right
whereas like a single leg i can shoot a

3776
00:59:40,870 --> 00:59:40,880
whereas like a single leg i can shoot a
 

3777
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,069
whereas like a single leg i can shoot a
single leg with many different

3778
00:59:42,069 --> 00:59:42,079
single leg with many different
 

3779
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:43,430
single leg with many different
velocities

3780
00:59:43,430 --> 00:59:43,440
velocities
 

3781
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:45,270
velocities
i can shoot at different angles i can

3782
00:59:45,270 --> 00:59:45,280
i can shoot at different angles i can
 

3783
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:47,670
i can shoot at different angles i can
shoot with different amounts of force

3784
00:59:47,670 --> 00:59:47,680
shoot with different amounts of force
 

3785
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:49,349
shoot with different amounts of force
right i can shoot with my my head up

3786
00:59:49,349 --> 00:59:49,359
right i can shoot with my my head up
 

3787
00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:50,789
right i can shoot with my my head up
versus my head i mean right all these

3788
00:59:50,789 --> 00:59:50,799
versus my head i mean right all these
 

3789
00:59:50,799 --> 00:59:52,150
versus my head i mean right all these
things are going to matter if we're

3790
00:59:52,150 --> 00:59:52,160
things are going to matter if we're
 

3791
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:54,150
things are going to matter if we're
talking about a human being defending

3792
00:59:54,150 --> 00:59:54,160
talking about a human being defending
 

3793
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:56,230
talking about a human being defending
the single leg all of those things are

3794
00:59:56,230 --> 00:59:56,240
the single leg all of those things are
 

3795
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:57,589
the single leg all of those things are
going to matter and and that's where

3796
00:59:57,589 --> 00:59:57,599
going to matter and and that's where
 

3797
00:59:57,599 --> 00:59:59,270
going to matter and and that's where
human beings are

3798
00:59:59,270 --> 00:59:59,280
human beings are
 

3799
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:00,950
human beings are
who wrestle are calculating those things

3800
01:00:00,950 --> 01:00:00,960
who wrestle are calculating those things
 

3801
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:02,630
who wrestle are calculating those things
subconsciously they're obviously not

3802
01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:02,640
subconsciously they're obviously not
 

3803
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,789
subconsciously they're obviously not
consciously calculating in their head oh

3804
01:00:04,789 --> 01:00:04,799
consciously calculating in their head oh
 

3805
01:00:04,799 --> 01:00:06,710
consciously calculating in their head oh
the the forces coming at me at this so i

3806
01:00:06,710 --> 01:00:06,720
the the forces coming at me at this so i
 

3807
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:08,069
the the forces coming at me at this so i
need to do that right they're just doing

3808
01:00:08,069 --> 01:00:08,079
need to do that right they're just doing
 

3809
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:09,190
need to do that right they're just doing
it

3810
01:00:09,190 --> 01:00:09,200
it
 

3811
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:11,349
it
but see the the thing is so you would

3812
01:00:11,349 --> 01:00:11,359
but see the the thing is so you would
 

3813
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:13,270
but see the the thing is so you would
absolutely if you're doing a robot that

3814
01:00:13,270 --> 01:00:13,280
absolutely if you're doing a robot that
 

3815
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:14,630
absolutely if you're doing a robot that
you're wrestling you're going to have to

3816
01:00:14,630 --> 01:00:14,640
you're wrestling you're going to have to
 

3817
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:16,470
you're wrestling you're going to have to
constrain the speed at which it moves

3818
01:00:16,470 --> 01:00:16,480
constrain the speed at which it moves
 

3819
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:19,030
constrain the speed at which it moves
and the power that it's able to deliver

3820
01:00:19,030 --> 01:00:19,040
and the power that it's able to deliver
 

3821
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:21,589
and the power that it's able to deliver
so that presumably that'll be the

3822
01:00:21,589 --> 01:00:21,599
so that presumably that'll be the
 

3823
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:23,349
so that presumably that'll be the
limitations so then it'll be just the

3824
01:00:23,349 --> 01:00:23,359
limitations so then it'll be just the
 

3825
01:00:23,359 --> 01:00:25,270
limitations so then it'll be just the
same exact way as a human but then but

3826
01:00:25,270 --> 01:00:25,280
same exact way as a human but then but
 

3827
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:27,910
same exact way as a human but then but
it's good to even so if we go human max

3828
01:00:27,910 --> 01:00:27,920
it's good to even so if we go human max
 

3829
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:29,750
it's good to even so if we go human max
force right jordan bros double max force

3830
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:29,760
force right jordan bros double max force
 

3831
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:31,430
force right jordan bros double max force
right that's the highest as highest we

3832
01:00:31,430 --> 01:00:31,440
right that's the highest as highest we
 

3833
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:34,470
right that's the highest as highest we
get then we go down from there um

3834
01:00:34,470 --> 01:00:34,480
get then we go down from there um
 

3835
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:36,950
get then we go down from there um
even even with even within that it's

3836
01:00:36,950 --> 01:00:36,960
even even with even within that it's
 

3837
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,870
even even with even within that it's
like sometimes i can choose single leg

3838
01:00:38,870 --> 01:00:38,880
like sometimes i can choose single leg
 

3839
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:40,309
like sometimes i can choose single leg
with a maximum force of i don't know

3840
01:00:40,309 --> 01:00:40,319
with a maximum force of i don't know
 

3841
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:41,829
with a maximum force of i don't know
we'll just say we'll say 20. this is a

3842
01:00:41,829 --> 01:00:41,839
we'll just say we'll say 20. this is a
 

3843
01:00:41,839 --> 01:00:43,030
we'll just say we'll say 20. this is a
number right

3844
01:00:43,030 --> 01:00:43,040
number right
 

3845
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:45,270
number right
i don't know shoot at 20 because i feel

3846
01:00:45,270 --> 01:00:45,280
i don't know shoot at 20 because i feel
 

3847
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:47,030
i don't know shoot at 20 because i feel
sometimes i shoot at 15. sometimes you

3848
01:00:47,030 --> 01:00:47,040
sometimes i shoot at 15. sometimes you
 

3849
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:49,510
sometimes i shoot at 15. sometimes you
shoot at 12 right because you you feel

3850
01:00:49,510 --> 01:00:49,520
shoot at 12 right because you you feel
 

3851
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:50,950
shoot at 12 right because you you feel
something in your opponent that makes

3852
01:00:50,950 --> 01:00:50,960
something in your opponent that makes
 

3853
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:52,710
something in your opponent that makes
you do it differently so they would have

3854
01:00:52,710 --> 01:00:52,720
you do it differently so they would have
 

3855
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:54,950
you do it differently so they would have
to learn how and then you know all these

3856
01:00:54,950 --> 01:00:54,960
to learn how and then you know all these
 

3857
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:56,309
to learn how and then you know all these
different things and sometimes maybe i

3858
01:00:56,309 --> 01:00:56,319
different things and sometimes maybe i
 

3859
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:59,030
different things and sometimes maybe i
clamp a little harder so the the robot

3860
01:00:59,030 --> 01:00:59,040
clamp a little harder so the the robot
 

3861
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:01,349
clamp a little harder so the the robot
would have to learn all these different

3862
01:01:01,349 --> 01:01:01,359
would have to learn all these different
 

3863
01:01:01,359 --> 01:01:03,589
would have to learn all these different
incoming inputs to the system and then

3864
01:01:03,589 --> 01:01:03,599
incoming inputs to the system and then
 

3865
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:06,150
incoming inputs to the system and then
create this reaction oh no no 100 so

3866
01:01:06,150 --> 01:01:06,160
create this reaction oh no no 100 so
 

3867
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:08,150
create this reaction oh no no 100 so
this would be all continuous like yeah

3868
01:01:08,150 --> 01:01:08,160
this would be all continuous like yeah
 

3869
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:09,670
this would be all continuous like yeah
so unlike chess it would not it's just

3870
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:09,680
so unlike chess it would not it's just
 

3871
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:11,910
so unlike chess it would not it's just
chess is discreet there's it's uh one

3872
01:01:11,910 --> 01:01:11,920
chess is discreet there's it's uh one
 

3873
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:12,630
chess is discreet there's it's uh one
then

3874
01:01:12,630 --> 01:01:12,640
then
 

3875
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:15,190
then
you move it's it's a very specific set

3876
01:01:15,190 --> 01:01:15,200
you move it's it's a very specific set
 

3877
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:17,510
you move it's it's a very specific set
of moves now here you would those are

3878
01:01:17,510 --> 01:01:17,520
of moves now here you would those are
 

3879
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:19,270
of moves now here you would those are
all variables you control and they're

3880
01:01:19,270 --> 01:01:19,280
all variables you control and they're
 

3881
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:21,670
all variables you control and they're
continuous variables so the speed the

3882
01:01:21,670 --> 01:01:21,680
continuous variables so the speed the
 

3883
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:23,910
continuous variables so the speed the
force there's actuators so there's all

3884
01:01:23,910 --> 01:01:23,920
force there's actuators so there's all
 

3885
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:26,549
force there's actuators so there's all
these joints right yeah you can move i

3886
01:01:26,549 --> 01:01:26,559
these joints right yeah you can move i
 

3887
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:28,390
these joints right yeah you can move i
mean it's just an optimization problem

3888
01:01:28,390 --> 01:01:28,400
mean it's just an optimization problem
 

3889
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:30,150
mean it's just an optimization problem
it's kind of fast it's fascinating so

3890
01:01:30,150 --> 01:01:30,160
it's kind of fast it's fascinating so
 

3891
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:31,430
it's kind of fast it's fascinating so
i've been fascinated thinking about it

3892
01:01:31,430 --> 01:01:31,440
i've been fascinated thinking about it
 

3893
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:33,349
i've been fascinated thinking about it
since you guys talked about it with i it

3894
01:01:33,349 --> 01:01:33,359
since you guys talked about it with i it
 

3895
01:01:33,359 --> 01:01:34,710
since you guys talked about it with i it
was a long time ago i listened to it

3896
01:01:34,710 --> 01:01:34,720
was a long time ago i listened to it
 

3897
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:36,069
was a long time ago i listened to it
probably three three to four weeks going

3898
01:01:36,069 --> 01:01:36,079
probably three three to four weeks going
 

3899
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:37,910
probably three three to four weeks going
up and kind of been like obsessing about

3900
01:01:37,910 --> 01:01:37,920
up and kind of been like obsessing about
 

3901
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:41,589
up and kind of been like obsessing about
it ever since but yeah it just changes

3902
01:01:41,589 --> 01:01:41,599
it ever since but yeah it just changes
 

3903
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:42,950
it ever since but yeah it just changes
when um

3904
01:01:42,950 --> 01:01:42,960
when um
 

3905
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:46,069
when um
so unlike boxing for example or striking

3906
01:01:46,069 --> 01:01:46,079
so unlike boxing for example or striking
 

3907
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:48,069
so unlike boxing for example or striking
it you know once you grab a hold of

3908
01:01:48,069 --> 01:01:48,079
it you know once you grab a hold of
 

3909
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:49,270
it you know once you grab a hold of
somebody

3910
01:01:49,270 --> 01:01:49,280
somebody
 

3911
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:52,309
somebody
it change you're now one body right so

3912
01:01:52,309 --> 01:01:52,319
it change you're now one body right so
 

3913
01:01:52,319 --> 01:01:54,150
it change you're now one body right so
yeah it's very complicated it's not just

3914
01:01:54,150 --> 01:01:54,160
yeah it's very complicated it's not just
 

3915
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:56,630
yeah it's very complicated it's not just
shooting a a double leg without like

3916
01:01:56,630 --> 01:01:56,640
shooting a a double leg without like
 

3917
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:58,630
shooting a a double leg without like
maybe doing like

3918
01:01:58,630 --> 01:01:58,640
maybe doing like
 

3919
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:00,309
maybe doing like
like faking a double leg and then

3920
01:02:00,309 --> 01:02:00,319
like faking a double leg and then
 

3921
01:02:00,319 --> 01:02:02,150
like faking a double leg and then
shooting the double leg that's very

3922
01:02:02,150 --> 01:02:02,160
shooting the double leg that's very
 

3923
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:04,789
shooting the double leg that's very
doable with robotics but then like

3924
01:02:04,789 --> 01:02:04,799
doable with robotics but then like
 

3925
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:07,430
doable with robotics but then like
doing a clinch and from there

3926
01:02:07,430 --> 01:02:07,440
doing a clinch and from there
 

3927
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:11,430
doing a clinch and from there
doing like a russian tie like that

3928
01:02:11,430 --> 01:02:11,440
doing like a russian tie like that
 

3929
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:13,430
doing like a russian tie like that
that's uh i think that's way harder than

3930
01:02:13,430 --> 01:02:13,440
that's uh i think that's way harder than
 

3931
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:15,750
that's uh i think that's way harder than
people realize in terms of how many

3932
01:02:15,750 --> 01:02:15,760
people realize in terms of how many
 

3933
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:17,990
people realize in terms of how many
things are involved like the force of

3934
01:02:17,990 --> 01:02:18,000
things are involved like the force of
 

3935
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,309
things are involved like the force of
the grip the leverage you're providing

3936
01:02:20,309 --> 01:02:20,319
the grip the leverage you're providing
 

3937
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:21,589
the grip the leverage you're providing
with all the different parts of the

3938
01:02:21,589 --> 01:02:21,599
with all the different parts of the
 

3939
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:23,829
with all the different parts of the
shoulder and the arm and the torso the

3940
01:02:23,829 --> 01:02:23,839
shoulder and the arm and the torso the
 

3941
01:02:23,839 --> 01:02:25,990
shoulder and the arm and the torso the
twist how much of your weight are you

3942
01:02:25,990 --> 01:02:26,000
twist how much of your weight are you
 

3943
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,670
twist how much of your weight are you
allocating like leaning on the other

3944
01:02:27,670 --> 01:02:27,680
allocating like leaning on the other
 

3945
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:29,670
allocating like leaning on the other
person yeah like taking weight off of

3946
01:02:29,670 --> 01:02:29,680
person yeah like taking weight off of
 

3947
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:31,670
person yeah like taking weight off of
one of your legs and the other leg all

3948
01:02:31,670 --> 01:02:31,680
one of your legs and the other leg all
 

3949
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:33,190
one of your legs and the other leg all
of that i think

3950
01:02:33,190 --> 01:02:33,200
of that i think
 

3951
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:34,549
of that i think
that's the really interesting thing

3952
01:02:34,549 --> 01:02:34,559
that's the really interesting thing
 

3953
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:36,549
that's the really interesting thing
about humans is we're able to do all of

3954
01:02:36,549 --> 01:02:36,559
about humans is we're able to do all of
 

3955
01:02:36,559 --> 01:02:38,950
about humans is we're able to do all of
this calculation subconsciously yeah

3956
01:02:38,950 --> 01:02:38,960
this calculation subconsciously yeah
 

3957
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:40,870
this calculation subconsciously yeah
subconsciously yeah and that's what i've

3958
01:02:40,870 --> 01:02:40,880
subconsciously yeah and that's what i've
 

3959
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:43,109
subconsciously yeah and that's what i've
been thinking about since we it's like

3960
01:02:43,109 --> 01:02:43,119
been thinking about since we it's like
 

3961
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:44,870
been thinking about since we it's like
how many things even these high school

3962
01:02:44,870 --> 01:02:44,880
how many things even these high school
 

3963
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:47,190
how many things even these high school
athletes who are like getting medium

3964
01:02:47,190 --> 01:02:47,200
athletes who are like getting medium
 

3965
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:49,670
athletes who are like getting medium
good are subconsciously thinking about

3966
01:02:49,670 --> 01:02:49,680
good are subconsciously thinking about
 

3967
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:51,430
good are subconsciously thinking about
all the time or not even not even

3968
01:02:51,430 --> 01:02:51,440
all the time or not even not even
 

3969
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:53,270
all the time or not even not even
thinking about sorry reacting to

3970
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:53,280
thinking about sorry reacting to
 

3971
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:55,589
thinking about sorry reacting to
um but then even like for me i'm you

3972
01:02:55,589 --> 01:02:55,599
um but then even like for me i'm you
 

3973
01:02:55,599 --> 01:02:57,430
um but then even like for me i'm you
know i'm a few orders of meg do better

3974
01:02:57,430 --> 01:02:57,440
know i'm a few orders of meg do better
 

3975
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:58,630
know i'm a few orders of meg do better
than somebody's kid that player and so

3976
01:02:58,630 --> 01:02:58,640
than somebody's kid that player and so
 

3977
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:00,309
than somebody's kid that player and so
when i when i go like super hard it's

3978
01:03:00,309 --> 01:03:00,319
when i when i go like super hard it's
 

3979
01:03:00,319 --> 01:03:01,349
when i when i go like super hard it's
like

3980
01:03:01,349 --> 01:03:01,359
like
 

3981
01:03:01,359 --> 01:03:02,870
like
i can feel their weight moving the wrong

3982
01:03:02,870 --> 01:03:02,880
i can feel their weight moving the wrong
 

3983
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:04,710
i can feel their weight moving the wrong
direction and so for me to off balance

3984
01:03:04,710 --> 01:03:04,720
direction and so for me to off balance
 

3985
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:06,069
direction and so for me to off balance
them or trip them or whatever it's kind

3986
01:03:06,069 --> 01:03:06,079
them or trip them or whatever it's kind
 

3987
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:08,150
them or trip them or whatever it's kind
of easy sometimes you know because

3988
01:03:08,150 --> 01:03:08,160
of easy sometimes you know because
 

3989
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:10,470
of easy sometimes you know because
they're not feeling it

3990
01:03:10,470 --> 01:03:10,480
they're not feeling it
 

3991
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:12,069
they're not feeling it
the right way right or their timing's

3992
01:03:12,069 --> 01:03:12,079
the right way right or their timing's
 

3993
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:14,390
the right way right or their timing's
just a little bit off or the way they're

3994
01:03:14,390 --> 01:03:14,400
just a little bit off or the way they're
 

3995
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:15,670
just a little bit off or the way they're
grabbing the hip maybe they should be up

3996
01:03:15,670 --> 01:03:15,680
grabbing the hip maybe they should be up
 

3997
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:17,670
grabbing the hip maybe they should be up
a little higher right these really small

3998
01:03:17,670 --> 01:03:17,680
a little higher right these really small
 

3999
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:18,789
a little higher right these really small
things

4000
01:03:18,789 --> 01:03:18,799
things
 

4001
01:03:18,799 --> 01:03:19,829
things
um

4002
01:03:19,829 --> 01:03:19,839
um
 

4003
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:21,430
um
yeah i think that's all easy to take

4004
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:21,440
yeah i think that's all easy to take
 

4005
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:23,029
yeah i think that's all easy to take
advantage of for a robot it's just

4006
01:03:23,029 --> 01:03:23,039
advantage of for a robot it's just
 

4007
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:24,630
advantage of for a robot it's just
there's so many things

4008
01:03:24,630 --> 01:03:24,640
there's so many things
 

4009
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:26,789
there's so many things
the the big problem

4010
01:03:26,789 --> 01:03:26,799
the the big problem
 

4011
01:03:26,799 --> 01:03:28,710
the the big problem
is ethically

4012
01:03:28,710 --> 01:03:28,720
is ethically
 

4013
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:30,069
is ethically
i don't know how many people are willing

4014
01:03:30,069 --> 01:03:30,079
i don't know how many people are willing
 

4015
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:32,309
i don't know how many people are willing
to train with a robot because

4016
01:03:32,309 --> 01:03:32,319
to train with a robot because
 

4017
01:03:32,319 --> 01:03:34,069
to train with a robot because
you're gonna get hurt well couldn't you

4018
01:03:34,069 --> 01:03:34,079
you're gonna get hurt well couldn't you
 

4019
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:36,069
you're gonna get hurt well couldn't you
make a robot change the robot or no

4020
01:03:36,069 --> 01:03:36,079
make a robot change the robot or no
 

4021
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:38,789
make a robot change the robot or no
yes but then it's expensive

4022
01:03:38,789 --> 01:03:38,799
yes but then it's expensive
 

4023
01:03:38,799 --> 01:03:40,950
yes but then it's expensive
so because they're gonna put the padding

4024
01:03:40,950 --> 01:03:40,960
so because they're gonna put the padding
 

4025
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:43,430
so because they're gonna put the padding
on that thing i know but but then it's

4026
01:03:43,430 --> 01:03:43,440
on that thing i know but but then it's
 

4027
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:44,870
on that thing i know but but then it's
not

4028
01:03:44,870 --> 01:03:44,880
not
 

4029
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:45,750
not
you know

4030
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:45,760
you know
 

4031
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:48,150
you know
it it's

4032
01:03:48,150 --> 01:03:48,160
it it's
 

4033
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:51,029
it it's
then uh you're not capturing the full

4034
01:03:51,029 --> 01:03:51,039
then uh you're not capturing the full
 

4035
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:52,230
then uh you're not capturing the full
why can't you put like some rubber

4036
01:03:52,230 --> 01:03:52,240
why can't you put like some rubber
 

4037
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:53,750
why can't you put like some rubber
coating on them right you know something

4038
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:53,760
coating on them right you know something
 

4039
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:56,150
coating on them right you know something
for that effect you could i mean that

4040
01:03:56,150 --> 01:03:56,160
for that effect you could i mean that
 

4041
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:58,630
for that effect you could i mean that
you could yeah you could i mean you're

4042
01:03:58,630 --> 01:03:58,640
you could yeah you could i mean you're
 

4043
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:00,950
you could yeah you could i mean you're
talking about robots that are

4044
01:04:00,950 --> 01:04:00,960
talking about robots that are
 

4045
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:03,430
talking about robots that are
these are humanoid robots so

4046
01:04:03,430 --> 01:04:03,440
these are humanoid robots so
 

4047
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:05,829
these are humanoid robots so
we're talking about 500 000 million

4048
01:04:05,829 --> 01:04:05,839
we're talking about 500 000 million
 

4049
01:04:05,839 --> 01:04:07,270
we're talking about 500 000 million
robots

4050
01:04:07,270 --> 01:04:07,280
robots
 

4051
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:08,710
robots
so

4052
01:04:08,710 --> 01:04:08,720
so
 

4053
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:10,870
so
you would have to be motivated

4054
01:04:10,870 --> 01:04:10,880
you would have to be motivated
 

4055
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:12,470
you would have to be motivated
spend a lot of money to spend a lot of

4056
01:04:12,470 --> 01:04:12,480
spend a lot of money to spend a lot of
 

4057
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:14,630
spend a lot of money to spend a lot of
money because you have to have them

4058
01:04:14,630 --> 01:04:14,640
money because you have to have them
 

4059
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:16,309
money because you have to have them
wrestle

4060
01:04:16,309 --> 01:04:16,319
wrestle
 

4061
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:17,029
wrestle
for

4062
01:04:17,029 --> 01:04:17,039
for
 

4063
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:17,990
for
like

4064
01:04:17,990 --> 01:04:18,000
like
 

4065
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,190
like
a lot

4066
01:04:19,190 --> 01:04:19,200
a lot
 

4067
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:20,549
a lot
to get better you have to get better

4068
01:04:20,549 --> 01:04:20,559
to get better you have to get better
 

4069
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:21,990
to get better you have to get better
yeah and then

4070
01:04:21,990 --> 01:04:22,000
yeah and then
 

4071
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,029
yeah and then
the the open question is

4072
01:04:25,029 --> 01:04:25,039
the the open question is
 

4073
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:27,910
the the open question is
how long does it take to get good enough

4074
01:04:27,910 --> 01:04:27,920
how long does it take to get good enough
 

4075
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:29,829
how long does it take to get good enough
to beat a human

4076
01:04:29,829 --> 01:04:29,839
to beat a human
 

4077
01:04:29,839 --> 01:04:31,670
to beat a human
uh

4078
01:04:31,670 --> 01:04:31,680
uh
 

4079
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:33,430
uh
i don't i don't think i don't think we

4080
01:04:33,430 --> 01:04:33,440
i don't i don't think i don't think we
 

4081
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:34,789
i don't i don't think i don't think we
understand i don't know i don't think

4082
01:04:34,789 --> 01:04:34,799
understand i don't know i don't think
 

4083
01:04:34,799 --> 01:04:36,069
understand i don't know i don't think
you understand

4084
01:04:36,069 --> 01:04:36,079
you understand
 

4085
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:38,870
you understand
how hard wrestling is yeah like is it a

4086
01:04:38,870 --> 01:04:38,880
how hard wrestling is yeah like is it a
 

4087
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:40,390
how hard wrestling is yeah like is it a
really hard problem like what's harder

4088
01:04:40,390 --> 01:04:40,400
really hard problem like what's harder
 

4089
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:41,750
really hard problem like what's harder
chest or wrestling

4090
01:04:41,750 --> 01:04:41,760
chest or wrestling
 

4091
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:44,309
chest or wrestling
by far not even close that's yeah that's

4092
01:04:44,309 --> 01:04:44,319
by far not even close that's yeah that's
 

4093
01:04:44,319 --> 01:04:45,510
by far not even close that's yeah that's
the sense

4094
01:04:45,510 --> 01:04:45,520
the sense
 

4095
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:47,430
the sense
so because there's an infinite amount of

4096
01:04:47,430 --> 01:04:47,440
so because there's an infinite amount of
 

4097
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:49,750
so because there's an infinite amount of
moves right uh and possibilities so once

4098
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:49,760
moves right uh and possibilities so once
 

4099
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:51,670
moves right uh and possibilities so once
i shoot the single leg now you have

4100
01:04:51,670 --> 01:04:51,680
i shoot the single leg now you have
 

4101
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:53,430
i shoot the single leg now you have
x amount of choices once you make your

4102
01:04:53,430 --> 01:04:53,440
x amount of choices once you make your
 

4103
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:55,190
x amount of choices once you make your
choice now i have a choice x amount of

4104
01:04:55,190 --> 01:04:55,200
choice now i have a choice x amount of
 

4105
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:57,109
choice now i have a choice x amount of
choices no i now you have x amount

4106
01:04:57,109 --> 01:04:57,119
choices no i now you have x amount
 

4107
01:04:57,119 --> 01:04:58,470
choices no i now you have x amount
choice on the defense and we can just

4108
01:04:58,470 --> 01:04:58,480
choice on the defense and we can just
 

4109
01:04:58,480 --> 01:04:59,829
choice on the defense and we can just
keep going back and forth right and this

4110
01:04:59,829 --> 01:04:59,839
keep going back and forth right and this
 

4111
01:04:59,839 --> 01:05:01,109
keep going back and forth right and this
number becomes

4112
01:05:01,109 --> 01:05:01,119
number becomes
 

4113
01:05:01,119 --> 01:05:02,630
number becomes
yeah but the same happens with chess

4114
01:05:02,630 --> 01:05:02,640
yeah but the same happens with chess
 

4115
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:04,230
yeah but the same happens with chess
correct but then in wrestling you have

4116
01:05:04,230 --> 01:05:04,240
correct but then in wrestling you have
 

4117
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:05,829
correct but then in wrestling you have
to make these

4118
01:05:05,829 --> 01:05:05,839
to make these
 

4119
01:05:05,839 --> 01:05:08,150
to make these
movements in very instantaneously right

4120
01:05:08,150 --> 01:05:08,160
movements in very instantaneously right
 

4121
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:09,190
movements in very instantaneously right
because i should sing like i'm not going

4122
01:05:09,190 --> 01:05:09,200
because i should sing like i'm not going
 

4123
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:11,109
because i should sing like i'm not going
to wait and say what's your defense yeah

4124
01:05:11,109 --> 01:05:11,119
to wait and say what's your defense yeah
 

4125
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:12,789
to wait and say what's your defense yeah
right you mean instantaneously and then

4126
01:05:12,789 --> 01:05:12,799
right you mean instantaneously and then
 

4127
01:05:12,799 --> 01:05:14,710
right you mean instantaneously and then
also again based on the force and the

4128
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:14,720
also again based on the force and the
 

4129
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:16,789
also again based on the force and the
vectors and and the angles

4130
01:05:16,789 --> 01:05:16,799
vectors and and the angles
 

4131
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:19,270
vectors and and the angles
you have to calculate that and adjust so

4132
01:05:19,270 --> 01:05:19,280
you have to calculate that and adjust so
 

4133
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:20,950
you have to calculate that and adjust so
really you know if you're saying well i

4134
01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:20,960
really you know if you're saying well i
 

4135
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:22,549
really you know if you're saying well i
can shoot a single like it's not like

4136
01:05:22,549 --> 01:05:22,559
can shoot a single like it's not like
 

4137
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:24,789
can shoot a single like it's not like
moving it's not one move right it's if

4138
01:05:24,789 --> 01:05:24,799
moving it's not one move right it's if
 

4139
01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:26,470
moving it's not one move right it's if
you want to talk about different forces

4140
01:05:26,470 --> 01:05:26,480
you want to talk about different forces
 

4141
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:27,990
you want to talk about different forces
and stuff it could be hundreds or

4142
01:05:27,990 --> 01:05:28,000
and stuff it could be hundreds or
 

4143
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,349
and stuff it could be hundreds or
thousands of different moves based on

4144
01:05:29,349 --> 01:05:29,359
thousands of different moves based on
 

4145
01:05:29,359 --> 01:05:31,190
thousands of different moves based on
how hard i shoot it the angle the

4146
01:05:31,190 --> 01:05:31,200
how hard i shoot it the angle the
 

4147
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:32,630
how hard i shoot it the angle the
direction all of those things yeah but

4148
01:05:32,630 --> 01:05:32,640
direction all of those things yeah but
 

4149
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:34,549
direction all of those things yeah but
wait a minute so robots can do this kind

4150
01:05:34,549 --> 01:05:34,559
wait a minute so robots can do this kind
 

4151
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:36,950
wait a minute so robots can do this kind
of stuff really fast you would i

4152
01:05:36,950 --> 01:05:36,960
of stuff really fast you would i
 

4153
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:38,549
of stuff really fast you would i
people probably know the physiology of

4154
01:05:38,549 --> 01:05:38,559
people probably know the physiology of
 

4155
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:41,190
people probably know the physiology of
this but it's the the reaction speed for

4156
01:05:41,190 --> 01:05:41,200
this but it's the the reaction speed for
 

4157
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:42,870
this but it's the the reaction speed for
a human is maybe 100 milliseconds

4158
01:05:42,870 --> 01:05:42,880
a human is maybe 100 milliseconds
 

4159
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:44,309
a human is maybe 100 milliseconds
something like that i don't know from

4160
01:05:44,309 --> 01:05:44,319
something like that i don't know from
 

4161
01:05:44,319 --> 01:05:46,789
something like that i don't know from
sensation to to

4162
01:05:46,789 --> 01:05:46,799
sensation to to
 

4163
01:05:46,799 --> 01:05:47,910
sensation to to
like from

4164
01:05:47,910 --> 01:05:47,920
like from
 

4165
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:49,829
like from
the the signal traveling up your two

4166
01:05:49,829 --> 01:05:49,839
the the signal traveling up your two
 

4167
01:05:49,839 --> 01:05:51,190
the the signal traveling up your two
brain and down i don't know what that

4168
01:05:51,190 --> 01:05:51,200
brain and down i don't know what that
 

4169
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:53,990
brain and down i don't know what that
number is but uh robots certainly could

4170
01:05:53,990 --> 01:05:54,000
number is but uh robots certainly could
 

4171
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,789
number is but uh robots certainly could
do it way faster it you would actually

4172
01:05:56,789 --> 01:05:56,799
do it way faster it you would actually
 

4173
01:05:56,799 --> 01:05:59,829
do it way faster it you would actually
have to like constrain the speed

4174
01:05:59,829 --> 01:05:59,839
have to like constrain the speed
 

4175
01:05:59,839 --> 01:06:01,430
have to like constrain the speed
well so the robot's already killing the

4176
01:06:01,430 --> 01:06:01,440
well so the robot's already killing the
 

4177
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:02,630
well so the robot's already killing the
chess people

4178
01:06:02,630 --> 01:06:02,640
chess people
 

4179
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:05,029
chess people
right so yeah theoretically they could

4180
01:06:05,029 --> 01:06:05,039
right so yeah theoretically they could
 

4181
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:06,630
right so yeah theoretically they could
eventually beat wrestlers but you asked

4182
01:06:06,630 --> 01:06:06,640
eventually beat wrestlers but you asked
 

4183
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:08,470
eventually beat wrestlers but you asked
what was hard wrestling or chess

4184
01:06:08,470 --> 01:06:08,480
what was hard wrestling or chess
 

4185
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:10,549
what was hard wrestling or chess
yeah and i think wrestling is because of

4186
01:06:10,549 --> 01:06:10,559
yeah and i think wrestling is because of
 

4187
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:12,870
yeah and i think wrestling is because of
the time component in it and then the

4188
01:06:12,870 --> 01:06:12,880
the time component in it and then the
 

4189
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:15,270
the time component in it and then the
and and the physicality of

4190
01:06:15,270 --> 01:06:15,280
and and the physicality of
 

4191
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:17,349
and and the physicality of
you know is it this force or that force

4192
01:06:17,349 --> 01:06:17,359
you know is it this force or that force
 

4193
01:06:17,359 --> 01:06:19,270
you know is it this force or that force
you know because if if i'm gonna say say

4194
01:06:19,270 --> 01:06:19,280
you know because if if i'm gonna say say
 

4195
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:20,870
you know because if if i'm gonna say say
we're in a seat belt side by side right

4196
01:06:20,870 --> 01:06:20,880
we're in a seat belt side by side right
 

4197
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:24,230
we're in a seat belt side by side right
a wrestling seatbelt nothing too

4198
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:24,240
a wrestling seatbelt nothing too
 

4199
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:25,990
a wrestling seatbelt nothing too
based on the pressure you're giving me i

4200
01:06:25,990 --> 01:06:26,000
based on the pressure you're giving me i
 

4201
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,190
based on the pressure you're giving me i
might do a bunch of different things

4202
01:06:27,190 --> 01:06:27,200
might do a bunch of different things
 

4203
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:30,390
might do a bunch of different things
right and so like to an untrained eye

4204
01:06:30,390 --> 01:06:30,400
right and so like to an untrained eye
 

4205
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:32,309
right and so like to an untrained eye
they might both look like the same thing

4206
01:06:32,309 --> 01:06:32,319
they might both look like the same thing
 

4207
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:34,789
they might both look like the same thing
from you to a trained feel it's like

4208
01:06:34,789 --> 01:06:34,799
from you to a trained feel it's like
 

4209
01:06:34,799 --> 01:06:36,230
from you to a trained feel it's like
well in one case it's really evident i

4210
01:06:36,230 --> 01:06:36,240
well in one case it's really evident i
 

4211
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:37,589
well in one case it's really evident i
should go this way in other cases

4212
01:06:37,589 --> 01:06:37,599
should go this way in other cases
 

4213
01:06:37,599 --> 01:06:39,510
should go this way in other cases
evident i should go that way so the

4214
01:06:39,510 --> 01:06:39,520
evident i should go that way so the
 

4215
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:41,430
evident i should go that way so the
other thing to consider just like with

4216
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:41,440
other thing to consider just like with
 

4217
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:43,029
other thing to consider just like with
chess

4218
01:06:43,029 --> 01:06:43,039
chess
 

4219
01:06:43,039 --> 01:06:45,589
chess
the ai systems

4220
01:06:45,589 --> 01:06:45,599
the ai systems
 

4221
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:47,990
the ai systems
so human versus human play a certain way

4222
01:06:47,990 --> 01:06:48,000
so human versus human play a certain way
 

4223
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,589
so human versus human play a certain way
together they actually haven't

4224
01:06:49,589 --> 01:06:49,599
together they actually haven't
 

4225
01:06:49,599 --> 01:06:51,589
together they actually haven't
considered a really large number of

4226
01:06:51,589 --> 01:06:51,599
considered a really large number of
 

4227
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:52,789
considered a really large number of
strategies

4228
01:06:52,789 --> 01:06:52,799
strategies
 

4229
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:54,630
strategies
that ai systems discover so one

4230
01:06:54,630 --> 01:06:54,640
that ai systems discover so one
 

4231
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:55,990
that ai systems discover so one
possibility with a robot they'll

4232
01:06:55,990 --> 01:06:56,000
possibility with a robot they'll
 

4233
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,069
possibility with a robot they'll
discover certain ties and certain

4234
01:06:58,069 --> 01:06:58,079
discover certain ties and certain
 

4235
01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:00,710
discover certain ties and certain
takedowns what i'm saying that like will

4236
01:07:00,710 --> 01:07:00,720
takedowns what i'm saying that like will
 

4237
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:02,950
takedowns what i'm saying that like will
dominate no matter what the human does

4238
01:07:02,950 --> 01:07:02,960
dominate no matter what the human does
 

4239
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:04,470
dominate no matter what the human does
you think that so you think there's that

4240
01:07:04,470 --> 01:07:04,480
you think that so you think there's that
 

4241
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:06,230
you think that so you think there's that
so this i mean this was somewhat the

4242
01:07:06,230 --> 01:07:06,240
so this i mean this was somewhat the
 

4243
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:08,150
so this i mean this was somewhat the
wrestling's so fun is there's even after

4244
01:07:08,150 --> 01:07:08,160
wrestling's so fun is there's even after
 

4245
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:10,069
wrestling's so fun is there's even after
80 to 90 years there's this continuous

4246
01:07:10,069 --> 01:07:10,079
80 to 90 years there's this continuous
 

4247
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:12,549
80 to 90 years there's this continuous
evolution yeah so you can do some like

4248
01:07:12,549 --> 01:07:12,559
evolution yeah so you can do some like
 

4249
01:07:12,559 --> 01:07:14,309
evolution yeah so you can do some like
low single type thing like john smith

4250
01:07:14,309 --> 01:07:14,319
low single type thing like john smith
 

4251
01:07:14,319 --> 01:07:16,549
low single type thing like john smith
type of situation well like a downbot go

4252
01:07:16,549 --> 01:07:16,559
type of situation well like a downbot go
 

4253
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:18,470
type of situation well like a downbot go
behind is something that has really i

4254
01:07:18,470 --> 01:07:18,480
behind is something that has really i
 

4255
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:20,069
behind is something that has really i
would say really in the last five-ish

4256
01:07:20,069 --> 01:07:20,079
would say really in the last five-ish
 

4257
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:21,829
would say really in the last five-ish
years has really been evolved what's the

4258
01:07:21,829 --> 01:07:21,839
years has really been evolved what's the
 

4259
01:07:21,839 --> 01:07:24,069
years has really been evolved what's the
goal behind downbot go behind so when

4260
01:07:24,069 --> 01:07:24,079
goal behind downbot go behind so when
 

4261
01:07:24,079 --> 01:07:25,829
goal behind downbot go behind so when
you're sh well they just head inside or

4262
01:07:25,829 --> 01:07:25,839
you're sh well they just head inside or
 

4263
01:07:25,839 --> 01:07:27,589
you're sh well they just head inside or
head outside matters but there's one for

4264
01:07:27,589 --> 01:07:27,599
head outside matters but there's one for
 

4265
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:29,829
head outside matters but there's one for
both you shoot at me essentially i take

4266
01:07:29,829 --> 01:07:29,839
both you shoot at me essentially i take
 

4267
01:07:29,839 --> 01:07:32,470
both you shoot at me essentially i take
my leg boom and then so that was kind of

4268
01:07:32,470 --> 01:07:32,480
my leg boom and then so that was kind of
 

4269
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:34,150
my leg boom and then so that was kind of
in existence when i was in college right

4270
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:34,160
in existence when i was in college right
 

4271
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:35,510
in existence when i was in college right
you down block them and you stop but

4272
01:07:35,510 --> 01:07:35,520
you down block them and you stop but
 

4273
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:37,190
you down block them and you stop but
usually you hit on this side of their

4274
01:07:37,190 --> 01:07:37,200
usually you hit on this side of their
 

4275
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:39,109
usually you hit on this side of their
head right and now immediately as you

4276
01:07:39,109 --> 01:07:39,119
head right and now immediately as you
 

4277
01:07:39,119 --> 01:07:40,630
head right and now immediately as you
shoot i attack that shoulder and then i

4278
01:07:40,630 --> 01:07:40,640
shoot i attack that shoulder and then i
 

4279
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:42,630
shoot i attack that shoulder and then i
start hitting a go behind on you

4280
01:07:42,630 --> 01:07:42,640
start hitting a go behind on you
 

4281
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:45,670
start hitting a go behind on you
right and so like that in its current

4282
01:07:45,670 --> 01:07:45,680
right and so like that in its current
 

4283
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:47,029
right and so like that in its current
incarnation

4284
01:07:47,029 --> 01:07:47,039
incarnation
 

4285
01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:48,470
incarnation
it absolutely wasn't when i was in

4286
01:07:48,470 --> 01:07:48,480
it absolutely wasn't when i was in
 

4287
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:50,069
it absolutely wasn't when i was in
college i would say it probably became

4288
01:07:50,069 --> 01:07:50,079
college i would say it probably became
 

4289
01:07:50,079 --> 01:07:51,670
college i would say it probably became
popular

4290
01:07:51,670 --> 01:07:51,680
popular
 

4291
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:53,349
popular
five to seven years ago so yeah there's

4292
01:07:53,349 --> 01:07:53,359
five to seven years ago so yeah there's
 

4293
01:07:53,359 --> 01:07:55,589
five to seven years ago so yeah there's
these big things that are happening

4294
01:07:55,589 --> 01:07:55,599
these big things that are happening
 

4295
01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:57,190
these big things that are happening
and now now i really want a robot

4296
01:07:57,190 --> 01:07:57,200
and now now i really want a robot
 

4297
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:58,470
and now now i really want a robot
because i want to be ahead of the game i

4298
01:07:58,470 --> 01:07:58,480
because i want to be ahead of the game i
 

4299
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:00,230
because i want to be ahead of the game i
want to know exactly what i'm missing i

4300
01:08:00,230 --> 01:08:00,240
want to know exactly what i'm missing i
 

4301
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:01,990
want to know exactly what i'm missing i
mean one interesting thing you have with

4302
01:08:01,990 --> 01:08:02,000
mean one interesting thing you have with
 

4303
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,309
mean one interesting thing you have with
alpha zero that plays chess

4304
01:08:04,309 --> 01:08:04,319
alpha zero that plays chess
 

4305
01:08:04,319 --> 01:08:06,069
alpha zero that plays chess
is um

4306
01:08:06,069 --> 01:08:06,079
is um
 

4307
01:08:06,079 --> 01:08:08,309
is um
it sacrifices pieces much more than

4308
01:08:08,309 --> 01:08:08,319
it sacrifices pieces much more than
 

4309
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:11,270
it sacrifices pieces much more than
humans do so give you a piece and not

4310
01:08:11,270 --> 01:08:11,280
humans do so give you a piece and not
 

4311
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:13,109
humans do so give you a piece and not
only does it give you a piece it will

4312
01:08:13,109 --> 01:08:13,119
only does it give you a piece it will
 

4313
01:08:13,119 --> 01:08:16,709
only does it give you a piece it will
wait a bunch of moves before it makes

4314
01:08:16,709 --> 01:08:16,719
wait a bunch of moves before it makes
 

4315
01:08:16,719 --> 01:08:18,229
wait a bunch of moves before it makes
you pay

4316
01:08:18,229 --> 01:08:18,239
you pay
 

4317
01:08:18,239 --> 01:08:20,149
you pay
so because it knows that that's better

4318
01:08:20,149 --> 01:08:20,159
so because it knows that that's better
 

4319
01:08:20,159 --> 01:08:21,990
so because it knows that that's better
for the long term long term so like

4320
01:08:21,990 --> 01:08:22,000
for the long term long term so like
 

4321
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,709
for the long term long term so like
humans rarely sacrifice without

4322
01:08:24,709 --> 01:08:24,719
humans rarely sacrifice without
 

4323
01:08:24,719 --> 01:08:26,950
humans rarely sacrifice without
getting the piece back like two or three

4324
01:08:26,950 --> 01:08:26,960
getting the piece back like two or three
 

4325
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:29,829
getting the piece back like two or three
moves after uh alpha zero can wait like

4326
01:08:29,829 --> 01:08:29,839
moves after uh alpha zero can wait like
 

4327
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:31,189
moves after uh alpha zero can wait like
five moves

4328
01:08:31,189 --> 01:08:31,199
five moves
 

4329
01:08:31,199 --> 01:08:32,070
five moves
so

4330
01:08:32,070 --> 01:08:32,080
so
 

4331
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:33,269
so
so basically

4332
01:08:33,269 --> 01:08:33,279
so basically
 

4333
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:34,950
so basically
you'll have you potentially with

4334
01:08:34,950 --> 01:08:34,960
you'll have you potentially with
 

4335
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:37,510
you'll have you potentially with
wrestling you might have a a robot that

4336
01:08:37,510 --> 01:08:37,520
wrestling you might have a a robot that
 

4337
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:39,749
wrestling you might have a a robot that
like puts itself in bad positions but in

4338
01:08:39,749 --> 01:08:39,759
like puts itself in bad positions but in
 

4339
01:08:39,759 --> 01:08:42,229
like puts itself in bad positions but in
a certain kind of way then that will

4340
01:08:42,229 --> 01:08:42,239
a certain kind of way then that will
 

4341
01:08:42,239 --> 01:08:44,950
a certain kind of way then that will
actually lure the opponent in to trap

4342
01:08:44,950 --> 01:08:44,960
actually lure the opponent in to trap
 

4343
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:48,390
actually lure the opponent in to trap
exactly what my style's based on

4344
01:08:48,390 --> 01:08:48,400

 

4345
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:50,709

you basically narrow one one thing to do

4346
01:08:50,709 --> 01:08:50,719
you basically narrow one one thing to do
 

4347
01:08:50,719 --> 01:08:52,630
you basically narrow one one thing to do
is you narrow the set of choices you put

4348
01:08:52,630 --> 01:08:52,640
is you narrow the set of choices you put
 

4349
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:53,990
is you narrow the set of choices you put
yourself in a bad position but and

4350
01:08:53,990 --> 01:08:54,000
yourself in a bad position but and
 

4351
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,349
yourself in a bad position but and
there's a set of choices for them

4352
01:08:55,349 --> 01:08:55,359
there's a set of choices for them
 

4353
01:08:55,359 --> 01:08:56,550
there's a set of choices for them
because they're not used to it yeah

4354
01:08:56,550 --> 01:08:56,560
because they're not used to it yeah
 

4355
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:59,430
because they're not used to it yeah
they're not used to it and and then you

4356
01:08:59,430 --> 01:08:59,440
they're not used to it and and then you
 

4357
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:01,749
they're not used to it and and then you
you drag them into uh into your

4358
01:09:01,749 --> 01:09:01,759
you drag them into uh into your
 

4359
01:09:01,759 --> 01:09:04,630
you drag them into uh into your
yeah so but there's also

4360
01:09:04,630 --> 01:09:04,640
yeah so but there's also
 

4361
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:06,709
yeah so but there's also
the problem is there's mechanical issues

4362
01:09:06,709 --> 01:09:06,719
the problem is there's mechanical issues
 

4363
01:09:06,719 --> 01:09:08,070
the problem is there's mechanical issues
like it's actually just difficult to

because we have sensation throughout our
 

4369
01:09:13,199 --> 01:09:15,189
because we have sensation throughout our
body yeah it's just difficult to build

4370
01:09:15,189 --> 01:09:15,199
body yeah it's just difficult to build

again it was kind of after the fact
because

4980
01:19:08,950 --> 01:19:08,960

obviously um so that's part of his a lot

5100
01:21:04,629 --> 01:21:04,639
obviously um so that's part of his a lot
 

5101
01:21:04,639 --> 01:21:06,310

01:21:13,830 --> 01:21:13,840
lot of them it is a way out right there

5115
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:19,750
world from my understanding are really
well compensated compared to

5116
01:21:19,750 --> 01:21:19,760
well compensated compared to
 

5117
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:21,110
well compensated compared to
what the average person makes and

5118
01:21:21,110 --> 01:21:21,120
what the average person makes and
 

5119
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:22,470
what the average person makes and
they're treated really well so people

5120
01:21:22,470 --> 01:21:22,480

01:24:03,750 --> 01:24:03,760
some looks you know um so i think i
 

5289
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:04,790
some looks you know um so i think i
think it has really taken hold in

5290
01:24:04,790 --> 01:24:04,800
think it has really taken hold in
 

5291
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:05,910
think it has really taken hold in
america i think it's really beneficial

5292
01:24:05,910 --> 01:24:05,920
america i think it's really beneficial
 

5293
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:08,149
america i think it's really beneficial
for success and i think that's

5294
01:24:08,149 --> 01:24:08,159
for success and i think that's
 

5295
01:24:08,159 --> 01:24:09,430
for success and i think that's
i mean america is doing better than

5296
01:24:09,430 --> 01:24:09,440
i mean america is doing better than
 

5297
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:11,270
i mean america is doing better than
we've ever done historically well that's

5298
01:24:11,270 --> 01:24:11,280
we've ever done historically well that's
 

5299
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:13,189
we've ever done historically well that's
70 and 40 that's like an art form to

5300
01:24:13,189 --> 01:24:13,199
70 and 40 that's like an art form to
 

5301
01:24:13,199 --> 01:24:15,350
70 and 40 that's like an art form to
find that right place because uh like

5302
01:24:15,350 --> 01:24:15,360
find that right place because uh like
 

5303
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:17,030
find that right place because uh like
what the the really good people i've

5304
01:24:17,030 --> 01:24:17,040
what the the really good people i've
 

5305
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:19,350
what the the really good people i've
trained with they go

5306
01:24:19,350 --> 01:24:19,360
trained with they go
 

5307
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:20,870
trained with they go
much closer to 100

5308
01:24:20,870 --> 01:24:20,880
much closer to 100
 

5309
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:22,629
much closer to 100
speed wise

5310
01:24:22,629 --> 01:24:22,639
speed wise
 

5311
01:24:22,639 --> 01:24:25,110
speed wise
or like but without

5312
01:24:25,110 --> 01:24:25,120
or like but without
 

5313
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:27,350
or like but without
like forcing things yeah you would when

5314
01:24:27,350 --> 01:24:27,360
like forcing things yeah you would when
 

5315
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:29,110
like forcing things yeah you would when
you're going it's some weird

5316
01:24:29,110 --> 01:24:29,120
you're going it's some weird
 

5317
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:31,350
you're going it's some weird
combination of things that like if you

5318
01:24:31,350 --> 01:24:31,360
combination of things that like if you
 

5319
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:34,229
combination of things that like if you
truly earn a technique

5320
01:24:34,229 --> 01:24:34,239
truly earn a technique
 

5321
01:24:34,239 --> 01:24:35,750
truly earn a technique
then you're given that technique yeah

5322
01:24:35,750 --> 01:24:35,760
then you're given that technique yeah
 

5323
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:38,229
then you're given that technique yeah
yeah but like if you don't you don't

5324
01:24:38,229 --> 01:24:38,239
yeah but like if you don't you don't
 

5325
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:39,110
yeah but like if you don't you don't
yeah

5326
01:24:39,110 --> 01:24:39,120
yeah
 

5327
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:41,750
yeah
and then it becomes a much less injury

5328
01:24:41,750 --> 01:24:41,760
and then it becomes a much less injury
 

5329
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:43,510
and then it becomes a much less injury
prone it becomes somehow more fun more

5330
01:24:43,510 --> 01:24:43,520
prone it becomes somehow more fun more
 

5331
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:46,310
prone it becomes somehow more fun more
dynamic you don't get stuck in positions

5332
01:24:46,310 --> 01:24:46,320
dynamic you don't get stuck in positions
 

5333
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:48,310
dynamic you don't get stuck in positions
it's just a lot of movement

5334
01:24:48,310 --> 01:24:48,320
it's just a lot of movement
 

5335
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:49,990
it's just a lot of movement
yeah the one thing so you you and john

5336
01:24:49,990 --> 01:24:50,000
yeah the one thing so you you and john
 

5337
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,750
yeah the one thing so you you and john
talked about the uh you know like

5338
01:24:51,750 --> 01:24:51,760
talked about the uh you know like
 

5339
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:53,830
talked about the uh you know like
different ways to learn and get better

5340
01:24:53,830 --> 01:24:53,840
different ways to learn and get better
 

5341
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:55,510
different ways to learn and get better
and so i think john obviously innovated

5342
01:24:55,510 --> 01:24:55,520
and so i think john obviously innovated
 

5343
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:58,709
and so i think john obviously innovated
within the sport of jiu jitsu um

5344
01:24:58,709 --> 01:24:58,719
within the sport of jiu jitsu um
 

5345
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:01,189
within the sport of jiu jitsu um
and so for us one and maybe there's just

5346
01:25:01,189 --> 01:25:01,199
and so for us one and maybe there's just
 

5347
01:25:01,199 --> 01:25:03,350
and so for us one and maybe there's just
a differentiator for us

5348
01:25:03,350 --> 01:25:03,360
a differentiator for us
 

5349
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:05,110
a differentiator for us
i think about it so excited to interrupt

5350
01:25:05,110 --> 01:25:05,120
i think about it so excited to interrupt
 

5351
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:06,629
i think about it so excited to interrupt
you have this academy you sent me this

5352
01:25:06,629 --> 01:25:06,639
you have this academy you sent me this
 

5353
01:25:06,639 --> 01:25:08,310
you have this academy you sent me this
plan that you have like a really well

5354
01:25:08,310 --> 01:25:08,320
plan that you have like a really well
 

5355
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:09,430
plan that you have like a really well
thought through

5356
01:25:09,430 --> 01:25:09,440
thought through
 

5357
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:11,990
thought through
plan for how to develop a good wrestler

5358
01:25:11,990 --> 01:25:12,000
plan for how to develop a good wrestler
 

5359
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,470
plan for how to develop a good wrestler
so but so i think it's um

5360
01:25:14,470 --> 01:25:14,480
so but so i think it's um
 

5361
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:16,790
so but so i think it's um
so for me there's four categories right

5362
01:25:16,790 --> 01:25:16,800
so for me there's four categories right
 

5363
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:19,030
so for me there's four categories right
there's the teaching which is like you

5364
01:25:19,030 --> 01:25:19,040
there's the teaching which is like you
 

5365
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:20,790
there's the teaching which is like you
don't know [\h__\h] i'm you're coming in and

5366
01:25:20,790 --> 01:25:20,800
don't know [\h__\h] i'm you're coming in and
 

5367
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:22,550
don't know [\h__\h] i'm you're coming in and
i'm showing you the move and you're

5368
01:25:22,550 --> 01:25:22,560
i'm showing you the move and you're
 

5369
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:23,830
i'm showing you the move and you're
literally going out there and you're

5370
01:25:23,830 --> 01:25:23,840
literally going out there and you're
 

5371
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:26,070
literally going out there and you're
trying to me that's not even drilling

5372
01:25:26,070 --> 01:25:26,080
trying to me that's not even drilling
 

5373
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:27,750
trying to me that's not even drilling
that's like teaching like you're trying

5374
01:25:27,750 --> 01:25:27,760
that's like teaching like you're trying
 

5375
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:29,350
that's like teaching like you're trying
to learn something

5376
01:25:29,350 --> 01:25:29,360
to learn something
 

5377
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:31,430
to learn something
so obviously in someone's earlier

5378
01:25:31,430 --> 01:25:31,440
so obviously in someone's earlier
 

5379
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:34,070
so obviously in someone's earlier
periods they're spending a lot of time

5380
01:25:34,070 --> 01:25:34,080
periods they're spending a lot of time
 

5381
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:35,510
periods they're spending a lot of time
in that phase because they literally

5382
01:25:35,510 --> 01:25:35,520
in that phase because they literally
 

5383
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:37,350
in that phase because they literally
don't even know how to move their bodies

5384
01:25:37,350 --> 01:25:37,360
don't even know how to move their bodies
 

5385
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:38,550
don't even know how to move their bodies
the right way

5386
01:25:38,550 --> 01:25:38,560
the right way
 

5387
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:40,070
the right way
once you learn the skill then there's

5388
01:25:40,070 --> 01:25:40,080
once you learn the skill then there's
 

5389
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:41,830
once you learn the skill then there's
the drilling because you need to you

5390
01:25:41,830 --> 01:25:41,840
the drilling because you need to you
 

5391
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:43,669
the drilling because you need to you
absolutely have to get those reps to

5392
01:25:43,669 --> 01:25:43,679
absolutely have to get those reps to
 

5393
01:25:43,679 --> 01:25:45,189
absolutely have to get those reps to
become really proficient in that

5394
01:25:45,189 --> 01:25:45,199
become really proficient in that
 

5395
01:25:45,199 --> 01:25:47,189
become really proficient in that
movement and then the sparring and then

5396
01:25:47,189 --> 01:25:47,199
movement and then the sparring and then
 

5397
01:25:47,199 --> 01:25:49,910
movement and then the sparring and then
the live right and so like i think

5398
01:25:49,910 --> 01:25:49,920
the live right and so like i think
 

5399
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:51,990
the live right and so like i think
obviously by the time you get to the

5400
01:25:51,990 --> 01:25:52,000
obviously by the time you get to the
 

5401
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:52,870
obviously by the time you get to the
kind of

5402
01:25:52,870 --> 01:25:52,880
kind of
 

5403
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:55,189
kind of
end point right but further on

5404
01:25:55,189 --> 01:25:55,199
end point right but further on
 

5405
01:25:55,199 --> 01:25:58,229
end point right but further on
the time you spent teaching is so i

5406
01:25:58,229 --> 01:25:58,239
the time you spent teaching is so i
 

5407
01:25:58,239 --> 01:25:59,750
the time you spent teaching is so i
don't wanna say in i'm sorry in the

5408
01:25:59,750 --> 01:25:59,760
don't wanna say in i'm sorry in the
 

5409
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:01,750
don't wanna say in i'm sorry in the
learn learning teaching phase is not

5410
01:26:01,750 --> 01:26:01,760
learn learning teaching phase is not
 

5411
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:03,189
learn learning teaching phase is not
insignificant but so much smaller

5412
01:26:03,189 --> 01:26:03,199
insignificant but so much smaller
 

5413
01:26:03,199 --> 01:26:04,470
insignificant but so much smaller
because to someone who's really good who

5414
01:26:04,470 --> 01:26:04,480
because to someone who's really good who
 

5415
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:06,149
because to someone who's really good who
have coached for 10 years i don't have

5416
01:26:06,149 --> 01:26:06,159
have coached for 10 years i don't have
 

5417
01:26:06,159 --> 01:26:07,590
have coached for 10 years i don't have
to give this big long drawn-out

5418
01:26:07,590 --> 01:26:07,600
to give this big long drawn-out
 

5419
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:09,590
to give this big long drawn-out
explanation i just have to say hey move

5420
01:26:09,590 --> 01:26:09,600
explanation i just have to say hey move
 

5421
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:11,189
explanation i just have to say hey move
move your hand a little differently

5422
01:26:11,189 --> 01:26:11,199
move your hand a little differently
 

5423
01:26:11,199 --> 01:26:12,870
move your hand a little differently
right or just do this yeah right we

5424
01:26:12,870 --> 01:26:12,880
right or just do this yeah right we
 

5425
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:14,550
right or just do this yeah right we
don't spend any time there so i think

5426
01:26:14,550 --> 01:26:14,560
don't spend any time there so i think
 

5427
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:16,390
don't spend any time there so i think
that's like something that consumes for

5428
01:26:16,390 --> 01:26:16,400
that's like something that consumes for
 

5429
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:18,870
that's like something that consumes for
the younger kids say five through 12 or

5430
01:26:18,870 --> 01:26:18,880
the younger kids say five through 12 or
 

5431
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:21,590
the younger kids say five through 12 or
13 we're consuming a massive amount of

5432
01:26:21,590 --> 01:26:21,600
13 we're consuming a massive amount of
 

5433
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:23,669
13 we're consuming a massive amount of
time there on that teaching learning

5434
01:26:23,669 --> 01:26:23,679
time there on that teaching learning
 

5435
01:26:23,679 --> 01:26:24,629
time there on that teaching learning
phase

5436
01:26:24,629 --> 01:26:24,639
phase
 

5437
01:26:24,639 --> 01:26:27,669
phase
and then as we get older that time wanes

5438
01:26:27,669 --> 01:26:27,679
and then as we get older that time wanes
 

5439
01:26:27,679 --> 01:26:29,910
and then as we get older that time wanes
a lot but that makes total sense right

5440
01:26:29,910 --> 01:26:29,920
a lot but that makes total sense right
 

5441
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:30,950
a lot but that makes total sense right
yeah

5442
01:26:30,950 --> 01:26:30,960
yeah
 

5443
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:32,709
yeah
it's funny because when you look at like

5444
01:26:32,709 --> 01:26:32,719
it's funny because when you look at like
 

5445
01:26:32,719 --> 01:26:34,390
it's funny because when you look at like
jiu jitsu schools

5446
01:26:34,390 --> 01:26:34,400
jiu jitsu schools
 

5447
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:36,229
jiu jitsu schools
they spend a lot of time in the teaching

5448
01:26:36,229 --> 01:26:36,239
they spend a lot of time in the teaching
 

5449
01:26:36,239 --> 01:26:38,310
they spend a lot of time in the teaching
learning and then the live

5450
01:26:38,310 --> 01:26:38,320
learning and then the live
 

5451
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:39,510
learning and then the live
it feels like there's not enough

5452
01:26:39,510 --> 01:26:39,520
it feels like there's not enough
 

5453
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:40,870
it feels like there's not enough
drilling i like how you draw a

5454
01:26:40,870 --> 01:26:40,880
drilling i like how you draw a
 

5455
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:43,750
drilling i like how you draw a
distinction there because it feels

5456
01:26:43,750 --> 01:26:43,760
distinction there because it feels
 

5457
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:44,950
distinction there because it feels
it feels like you're always starting

5458
01:26:44,950 --> 01:26:44,960
it feels like you're always starting
 

5459
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:46,950
it feels like you're always starting
from scratch like people have like very

5460
01:26:46,950 --> 01:26:46,960
from scratch like people have like very
 

5461
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:49,110
from scratch like people have like very
crappy short-term memory like they

5462
01:26:49,110 --> 01:26:49,120
crappy short-term memory like they
 

5463
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:50,950
crappy short-term memory like they
they're not uh

5464
01:26:50,950 --> 01:26:50,960
they're not uh
 

5465
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:53,030
they're not uh
like the way teaching is done is you

like the way teaching is done is you
 

5467
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:54,950
like the way teaching is done is you
show a technique from scratch

5468
01:26:54,950 --> 01:26:54,960
show a technique from scratch
 

5469
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:57,510
show a technique from scratch
and i just it seems disjoint it is for

5470
01:26:57,510 --> 01:26:57,520
and i just it seems disjoint it is for

the other thing i really struggled with
 

5573
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:29,669
the other thing i really struggled with
was to your point during

5574

was to your point during
live so many times it's just this five

5576
01:28:31,189 --> 01:28:31,199
live so many times it's just this five
 

5577

live so many times it's just this five
minute go go

5578
01:28:32,790 --> 01:28:32,800
minute go go
 

5579
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:34,310
minute go go
go and that's not the most efficient way

5580
01:28:34,310 --> 01:28:34,320
go and that's not the most efficient way
 

5581
01:28:34,320 --> 01:28:36,629
go and that's not the most efficient way
to learn because when you have two

5582
01:28:36,629 --> 01:28:36,639
to learn because when you have two
 

5583
01:28:36,639 --> 01:28:38,149
to learn because when you have two
people especially when they're focused

people especially when they're focused
on winning and you say go they're gonna

5586
01:28:40,470 --> 01:28:40,480
on winning and you say go they're gonna
 

5587

01:31:10,870 --> 01:31:10,880
the sprawl or you know i got to get
 

5743
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:12,390
the sprawl or you know i got to get
through their hands if i if i don't set

5744
01:31:12,390 --> 01:31:12,400
through their hands if i if i don't set
 

5745
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:13,830
through their hands if i if i don't set
it up right they might put their arm

5746
01:31:13,830 --> 01:31:13,840
it up right they might put their arm
 

5747
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:16,790
it up right they might put their arm
down right so it's like we are drilling

5748
01:31:16,790 --> 01:31:16,800
down right so it's like we are drilling
 

5749
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:18,390
down right so it's like we are drilling
because we're wrestling at a really low

5750
01:31:18,390 --> 01:31:18,400
because we're wrestling at a really low
 

5751
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:19,910
because we're wrestling at a really low
resistance level but there's a little

5752
01:31:19,910 --> 01:31:19,920
resistance level but there's a little
 

5753
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:21,830
resistance level but there's a little
bit of sparring oh yeah

5754
01:31:21,830 --> 01:31:21,840
bit of sparring oh yeah
 

5755
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:23,669
bit of sparring oh yeah
between yeah yeah yeah so that's not

5756
01:31:23,669 --> 01:31:23,679
between yeah yeah yeah so that's not
 

5757
01:31:23,679 --> 01:31:25,110
between yeah yeah yeah so that's not
really drilling because i think a

5758
01:31:25,110 --> 01:31:25,120
really drilling because i think a
 

5759
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:26,709
really drilling because i think a
drilling i think literally you're

5760
01:31:26,709 --> 01:31:26,719
drilling i think literally you're
 

5761
01:31:26,719 --> 01:31:28,550
drilling i think literally you're
shooting and i'm just going to boom your

5762
01:31:28,550 --> 01:31:28,560
shooting and i'm just going to boom your
 

5763
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:31,350
shooting and i'm just going to boom your
dummy

5764
01:31:31,350 --> 01:31:31,360

 

5765
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:32,870

it's very hard to be a dummy that

5766
01:31:32,870 --> 01:31:32,880
it's very hard to be a dummy that
 

5767
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:34,310
it's very hard to be a dummy that
doesn't do twenty percent so you're

5768
01:31:34,310 --> 01:31:34,320
doesn't do twenty percent so you're
 

5769
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:36,070
doesn't do twenty percent so you're
gonna do twenty percent yeah that's so

5770
01:31:36,070 --> 01:31:36,080
gonna do twenty percent yeah that's so
 

5771
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:37,910
gonna do twenty percent yeah that's so
so yes that's twenty percent but that's

5772
01:31:37,910 --> 01:31:37,920
so yes that's twenty percent but that's
 

5773
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:39,910
so yes that's twenty percent but that's
like sparring a little bit then

5774
01:31:39,910 --> 01:31:39,920
like sparring a little bit then
 

5775
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:41,590
like sparring a little bit then
no but they're not really resisting

5776
01:31:41,590 --> 01:31:41,600
no but they're not really resisting
 

5777
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:43,430
no but they're not really resisting
they're just giving you the right frame

5778
01:31:43,430 --> 01:31:43,440
they're just giving you the right frame
 

5779
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:45,189
they're just giving you the right frame
they're they're giving you the right

5781
01:31:45,199 --> 01:31:47,110
they're they're giving you the right
like movement and they're being they're

5782
01:31:47,110 --> 01:31:47,120
like movement and they're being they're
 

5783
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:49,830
like movement and they're being they're
being an intelligent dummy essentially i

5784
01:31:49,830 --> 01:31:49,840
being an intelligent dummy essentially i
 

5785
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:51,110
being an intelligent dummy essentially i
mean

5786
01:31:51,110 --> 01:31:51,120
mean
 

5787
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:52,550
mean
but also like the really important

5788
01:31:52,550 --> 01:31:52,560
but also like the really important
 

5789
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:53,910
but also like the really important
component of this is you pick the

5790
01:31:53,910 --> 01:31:53,920
component of this is you pick the
 

5791
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:56,310
component of this is you pick the
techniques for which it's beneficial if

5792
01:31:56,310 --> 01:31:56,320
techniques for which it's beneficial if
 

5793
01:31:56,320 --> 01:31:59,430
techniques for which it's beneficial if
the technique is has dynamic elements to

5794
01:31:59,430 --> 01:31:59,440
the technique is has dynamic elements to
 

5795
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:01,910
the technique is has dynamic elements to
it you don't want to be doing that with

5796
01:32:01,910 --> 01:32:01,920
it you don't want to be doing that with
 

5797
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:05,350
it you don't want to be doing that with
i'm saying like there's certain moves

5798
01:32:05,350 --> 01:32:05,360
i'm saying like there's certain moves
 

5799
01:32:05,360 --> 01:32:07,510
i'm saying like there's certain moves
and i like those moves and i select the

5800
01:32:07,510 --> 01:32:07,520
and i like those moves and i select the
 

5801
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:09,350
and i like those moves and i select the
game based on those moves

5802
01:32:09,350 --> 01:32:09,360
game based on those moves
 

5803
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:10,629
game based on those moves
are you drilling to get better are you

5804
01:32:10,629 --> 01:32:10,639
are you drilling to get better are you
 

5805
01:32:10,639 --> 01:32:12,709
are you drilling to get better are you
drawing just to work out no to get

5806
01:32:12,709 --> 01:32:12,719
drawing just to work out no to get
 

5807
01:32:12,719 --> 01:32:14,310
drawing just to work out no to get
better that's what i'm trying to tell

5808
01:32:14,310 --> 01:32:14,320
better that's what i'm trying to tell
 

5809
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:16,390
better that's what i'm trying to tell
you i i believe you can become like

5810
01:32:16,390 --> 01:32:16,400
you i i believe you can become like
 

5811
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:19,030
you i i believe you can become like
exceptionally good very fast by drilling

5812
01:32:19,030 --> 01:32:19,040
exceptionally good very fast by drilling
 

5813
01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:20,470
exceptionally good very fast by drilling
but how

5814
01:32:20,470 --> 01:32:20,480
but how
 

5815
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:22,149
but how
but

5816
01:32:22,149 --> 01:32:22,159
but
 

5817
01:32:22,159 --> 01:32:23,430
but
first of all let me let me ask you an

5818
01:32:23,430 --> 01:32:23,440
first of all let me let me ask you an
 

5819
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:25,350
first of all let me let me ask you an
empirical question let me

5820
01:32:25,350 --> 01:32:25,360
empirical question let me
 

5821
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:27,590
empirical question let me
have you actually drilled

5822
01:32:27,590 --> 01:32:27,600
have you actually drilled
 

5823
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:29,510
have you actually drilled
ten thousand times that's gonna move

5824
01:32:29,510 --> 01:32:29,520
ten thousand times that's gonna move
 

5825
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:31,669
ten thousand times that's gonna move
millions

5826
01:32:31,669 --> 01:32:31,679
millions
 

5827
01:32:31,679 --> 01:32:33,030
millions
you haven't drilled millions hundreds of

5828
01:32:33,030 --> 01:32:33,040
you haven't drilled millions hundreds of
 

5829
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:34,629
you haven't drilled millions hundreds of
thousands hundreds of thousands likely i

5830
01:32:34,629 --> 01:32:34,639
thousands hundreds of thousands likely i
 

5831
01:32:34,639 --> 01:32:36,629
thousands hundreds of thousands likely i
think you're just saying numbers

5832
01:32:36,629 --> 01:32:36,639
think you're just saying numbers
 

5833
01:32:36,639 --> 01:32:38,070
think you're just saying numbers
i don't think you know what a hundred

5834
01:32:38,070 --> 01:32:38,080
i don't think you know what a hundred
 

5835
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:39,990
i don't think you know what a hundred
thousand it's way more ten thousand i

5836
01:32:39,990 --> 01:32:40,000
thousand it's way more ten thousand i
 

5837
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:41,750
thousand it's way more ten thousand i
don't think it's over a hundred thousand

5838
01:32:41,750 --> 01:32:41,760
don't think it's over a hundred thousand
 

5839
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:43,030
don't think it's over a hundred thousand
there was a ten year period where i

5840
01:32:43,030 --> 01:32:43,040
there was a ten year period where i
 

5841
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:44,470
there was a ten year period where i
wrestled every single day that's yeah

5842
01:32:44,470 --> 01:32:44,480
wrestled every single day that's yeah
 

5843
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:46,550
wrestled every single day that's yeah
that's uh three thousand days so you're

5844
01:32:46,550 --> 01:32:46,560
that's uh three thousand days so you're
 

5845
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:47,910
that's uh three thousand days so you're
telling me ten thousand that's only

5846
01:32:47,910 --> 01:32:47,920
telling me ten thousand that's only
 

5847
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:49,270
telling me ten thousand that's only
three of them a day i did way more than

5848
01:32:49,270 --> 01:32:49,280
three of them a day i did way more than
 

5849
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:50,550
three of them a day i did way more than
that

5850
01:32:50,550 --> 01:32:50,560
that
 

5851
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:51,830
that
three of them probably had 30 of them a

5852
01:32:51,830 --> 01:32:51,840
three of them probably had 30 of them a
 

5853
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:53,590
three of them probably had 30 of them a
day that's that's a hundred thousand

5854
01:32:53,590 --> 01:32:53,600
day that's that's a hundred thousand
 

5855
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:56,070
day that's that's a hundred thousand
yeah yeah hundreds of thousands i'm i

5856
01:32:56,070 --> 01:32:56,080
yeah yeah hundreds of thousands i'm i
 

5857
01:32:56,080 --> 01:32:58,390
yeah yeah hundreds of thousands i'm i
doubt you get 30 a day for i did four i

5858
01:32:58,390 --> 01:32:58,400
doubt you get 30 a day for i did four i
 

5859
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:00,470
doubt you get 30 a day for i did four i
am for sure 100

5860
01:33:00,470 --> 01:33:00,480
am for sure 100
 

5861
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:01,910
am for sure 100
there's no doubt all right because some

5862
01:33:01,910 --> 01:33:01,920
there's no doubt all right because some
 

5863
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:03,430
there's no doubt all right because some
days i might do a hundred

5864
01:33:03,430 --> 01:33:03,440
days i might do a hundred
 

5865
01:33:03,440 --> 01:33:05,590
days i might do a hundred
right so 30 30 is not very many

5866
01:33:05,590 --> 01:33:05,600
right so 30 30 is not very many
 

5867
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:07,350
right so 30 30 is not very many
especially if we count all reps if we're

5868
01:33:07,350 --> 01:33:07,360
especially if we count all reps if we're
 

5869
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:09,750
especially if we count all reps if we're
counting drilling and live so like our

5870
01:33:09,750 --> 01:33:09,760
counting drilling and live so like our
 

5871
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:11,510
counting drilling and live so like our
coach college choices make us just drill

5872
01:33:11,510 --> 01:33:11,520
coach college choices make us just drill
 

5873
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:13,590
coach college choices make us just drill
a lot and i always hated it so i would i

5874
01:33:13,590 --> 01:33:13,600
a lot and i always hated it so i would i
 

5875
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:14,790
a lot and i always hated it so i would i
would rebel and just kind of give a

5876
01:33:14,790 --> 01:33:14,800
would rebel and just kind of give a
 

5877
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:15,910
would rebel and just kind of give a
little spar you know you shoot a high

5878
01:33:15,910 --> 01:33:15,920
little spar you know you shoot a high
 

5879
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:17,270
little spar you know you shoot a high
crotch we'll start you know coach wants

5880
01:33:17,270 --> 01:33:17,280
crotch we'll start you know coach wants
 

5881
01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:18,550
crotch we'll start you know coach wants
to draw high grounds okay we'll start

5882
01:33:18,550 --> 01:33:18,560
to draw high grounds okay we'll start
 

5883
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:19,910
to draw high grounds okay we'll start
you shoot the high crotch that's great

5884
01:33:19,910 --> 01:33:19,920
you shoot the high crotch that's great
 

5885
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:21,510
you shoot the high crotch that's great
then i'm gonna sit the corner i'm gonna

5886
01:33:21,510 --> 01:33:21,520
then i'm gonna sit the corner i'm gonna
 

5887
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:22,870
then i'm gonna sit the corner i'm gonna
give you my hip or i'm gonna you know

5888
01:33:22,870 --> 01:33:22,880
give you my hip or i'm gonna you know
 

5889
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:24,550
give you my hip or i'm gonna you know
i'm gonna try something so then you have

5890
01:33:24,550 --> 01:33:24,560
i'm gonna try something so then you have
 

5891
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:26,709
i'm gonna try something so then you have
to react and i would argue that

5892
01:33:26,709 --> 01:33:26,719
to react and i would argue that
 

5893
01:33:26,719 --> 01:33:27,750
to react and i would argue that
um

5894
01:33:27,750 --> 01:33:27,760
um
 

5895
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:29,350
um
all skill level

past like the beginner stuff is is some
necessity of that right i'm gonna do

5900
01:33:34,390 --> 01:33:34,400
necessity of that right i'm gonna do
 

5901
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:36,310
necessity of that right i'm gonna do
this then what are you gonna do it's

5902
01:33:36,310 --> 01:33:36,320
this then what are you gonna do it's
 

5903
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:37,669
this then what are you gonna do it's
it's back and forth i should just sing

5904
01:33:37,669 --> 01:33:37,679
it's back and forth i should just sing
 

5905
01:33:37,679 --> 01:33:38,709
it's back and forth i should just sing
like what are you gonna do i should

5906
01:33:38,709 --> 01:33:38,719
like what are you gonna do i should
 

5907
01:33:38,719 --> 01:33:41,110
like what are you gonna do i should
highlight 20 you and you have to start

5908
01:33:41,110 --> 01:33:41,120
highlight 20 you and you have to start
 

5909
01:33:41,120 --> 01:33:42,629

unconsciously programming these things

5910
01:33:42,629 --> 01:33:42,639
unconsciously programming these things
 

5911
01:33:42,639 --> 01:33:43,750
unconsciously programming these things
in your head because if you consciously

5912
01:33:43,750 --> 01:33:43,760
in your head because if you consciously
 

5913
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:44,790
in your head because if you consciously
think about it it's going to be too slow

5914
01:33:44,790 --> 01:33:44,800
think about it it's going to be too slow
 

5915
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:45,910
think about it it's going to be too slow
to actually hit in a matter but the

5916
01:33:45,910 --> 01:33:45,920
to actually hit in a matter but the
 

5917
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:47,750
to actually hit in a matter but the
drilling is the unconscious programming

5918
01:33:47,750 --> 01:33:47,760
drilling is the unconscious programming
 

5919
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:49,669
drilling is the unconscious programming
but but the simple movement the

like

5928
01:33:57,030 --> 01:33:57,040
like
 

5929
01:33:57,040 --> 01:33:59,110
like
i feel like the amount you're going to

5930
01:33:59,110 --> 01:33:59,120
i feel like the amount you're going to
 

5931
01:33:59,120 --> 01:34:00,950
i feel like the amount you're going to
get better at it is so miniscule

5932
01:34:00,950 --> 01:34:00,960
get better at it is so miniscule
 

5933
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:02,149
get better at it is so miniscule
compared to the amount you're going to

5934
01:34:02,149 --> 01:34:02,159
compared to the amount you're going to
 

5935
01:34:02,159 --> 01:34:05,590
compared to the amount you're going to
gain at doing other things around it

5936
01:34:05,590 --> 01:34:05,600
gain at doing other things around it
 

5937
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:08,550
gain at doing other things around it
no but that's the key word you feel

5938
01:34:08,550 --> 01:34:08,560
no but that's the key word you feel
 

5939
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:10,870
no but that's the key word you feel
okay that's your opinion if we did if we

5940
01:34:10,870 --> 01:34:10,880
okay that's your opinion if we did if we
 

5941
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:12,870
okay that's your opinion if we did if we
did a study on it that i would be proven

5942
01:34:12,870 --> 01:34:12,880
did a study on it that i would be proven
 

5943
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:14,550

correct no

5944
01:34:14,550 --> 01:34:14,560
correct no
 

5945
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:17,270

like the boredom of drilling like it's

5952
01:34:25,030 --> 01:34:25,040
like the boredom of drilling like it's
 

5953
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:26,790
like the boredom of drilling like it's
obvious that you that you have like

5954
01:34:26,790 --> 01:34:26,800
obvious that you that you have like
 

5955
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:28,709
obvious that you that you have like
you're such a creative energy that

5956
01:34:28,709 --> 01:34:28,719
you're such a creative energy that
 

5957
01:34:28,719 --> 01:34:31,189
you're such a creative energy that
you're just not going to be somebody

5958
01:34:31,189 --> 01:34:31,199
you're just not going to be somebody
 

5959
01:34:31,199 --> 01:34:33,110
you're just not going to be somebody
who's going to enjoy that so enjoyment

who's going to enjoy that so enjoyment
 

5961
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:34,390
who's going to enjoy that so enjoyment
is probably

5962
01:34:34,390 --> 01:34:34,400
is probably
 

5963

is probably
having an active mind is really

5964
01:34:35,990 --> 01:34:36,000
having an active mind is really
 

5965
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,470
having an active mind is really
important so the the the question is do

5966
01:34:38,470 --> 01:34:38,480
important so the the the question is do
 

5967
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:40,390
important so the the the question is do
you have the kind of makeup that has an

5968
01:34:40,390 --> 01:34:40,400
you have the kind of makeup that has an
 

5969
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:41,669
you have the kind of makeup that has an
active mind

5970
01:34:41,669 --> 01:34:41,679
active mind
 

5971
01:34:41,679 --> 01:34:45,350
active mind
during a drilling on a dummy and i have

5972
01:34:45,350 --> 01:34:45,360
during a drilling on a dummy and i have
 

5973
01:34:45,360 --> 01:34:46,870
during a drilling on a dummy and i have
that mind

5974
01:34:46,870 --> 01:34:46,880
that mind
 

5975
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:49,270
that mind
like yeah you really think okay so if

5976
01:34:49,270 --> 01:34:49,280
like yeah you really think okay so if
 

5977
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:51,189
like yeah you really think okay so if
you're uh let's pick a technique what

5978
01:34:51,189 --> 01:34:51,199
you're uh let's pick a technique what
 

5979
01:34:51,199 --> 01:34:53,109
you're uh let's pick a technique what
technique do you want to draw a lot

5980
01:34:53,109 --> 01:34:53,119
technique do you want to draw a lot
 

5981
01:34:53,119 --> 01:34:54,709
technique do you want to draw a lot
i was doing jiu jitsu or wrestling

5982
01:34:54,709 --> 01:34:54,719
i was doing jiu jitsu or wrestling
 

5983
01:34:54,719 --> 01:34:56,950
i was doing jiu jitsu or wrestling
whatever you want um

5984
01:34:56,950 --> 01:34:56,960
whatever you want um
 

5985
01:34:56,960 --> 01:34:58,470
whatever you want um
it's hard to describe with words but

5986
01:34:58,470 --> 01:34:58,480
it's hard to describe with words but
 

5987
01:34:58,480 --> 01:35:01,030
it's hard to describe with words but
certain guard passes uh let me let me

5988
01:35:01,030 --> 01:35:01,040
certain guard passes uh let me let me
 

5989
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:04,149
certain guard passes uh let me let me
think just guar pass okay so you have a

5990
01:35:04,149 --> 01:35:04,159
think just guar pass okay so you have a
 

5991
01:35:04,159 --> 01:35:06,629
think just guar pass okay so you have a
card pass and you get it to be as a 9.5

5992
01:35:06,629 --> 01:35:06,639
card pass and you get it to be as a 9.5
 

5993
01:35:06,639 --> 01:35:08,390
card pass and you get it to be as a 9.5
out of 10 right just from a from a

5994
01:35:08,390 --> 01:35:08,400
out of 10 right just from a from a
 

5995
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:09,910
out of 10 right just from a from a
technical standpoint

5996
01:35:09,910 --> 01:35:09,920
technical standpoint
 

5997
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:11,669
technical standpoint
don't you think you need some resistance

5998
01:35:11,669 --> 01:35:11,679
don't you think you need some resistance
 

5999
01:35:11,679 --> 01:35:13,910
don't you think you need some resistance
to feel because essentially all all

6000
01:35:13,910 --> 01:35:13,920
to feel because essentially all all
 

6001
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:16,790
to feel because essentially all all
benefit after that is going to be what

6002
01:35:16,790 --> 01:35:16,800
benefit after that is going to be what
 

6003
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:18,229
benefit after that is going to be what
are they going to try to do to me if

6004
01:35:18,229 --> 01:35:18,239
are they going to try to do to me if
 

6005
01:35:18,239 --> 01:35:19,990
are they going to try to do to me if
they shift that way do i need to i need

6006
01:35:19,990 --> 01:35:20,000
they shift that way do i need to i need
 

6007
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:21,990
they shift that way do i need to i need
a single year or move there so it's like

6008
01:35:21,990 --> 01:35:22,000
a single year or move there so it's like
 

6009
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,950
a single year or move there so it's like
i so i i actually think we're agreeing

6010
01:35:24,950 --> 01:35:24,960
i so i i actually think we're agreeing
 

6011
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:27,350
i so i i actually think we're agreeing
but maybe terminology wise well the

6012
01:35:27,350 --> 01:35:27,360
but maybe terminology wise well the
 

6013
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:29,189
but maybe terminology wise well the
split is the important thing like how

6014
01:35:29,189 --> 01:35:29,199
split is the important thing like how
 

6015
01:35:29,199 --> 01:35:30,470
split is the important thing like how
much of each

6016
01:35:30,470 --> 01:35:30,480
much of each
 

6017
01:35:30,480 --> 01:35:32,870
much of each
so i think it is spar i i think it's a

6018
01:35:32,870 --> 01:35:32,880
so i think it is spar i i think it's a
 

6019
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:35,030
so i think it is spar i i think it's a
very light touch bar is what you're

6020
01:35:35,030 --> 01:35:35,040
very light touch bar is what you're
 

6021
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:37,030
very light touch bar is what you're
talking about which is in my opinion

6022
01:35:37,030 --> 01:35:37,040
talking about which is in my opinion
 

6023
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:39,270
talking about which is in my opinion
really isn't drilling and it's because

6024
01:35:39,270 --> 01:35:39,280
really isn't drilling and it's because
 

6025
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:41,510
really isn't drilling and it's because
drilling past the basic proficiency i

6026
01:35:41,510 --> 01:35:41,520
drilling past the basic proficiency i
 

6027
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:43,270
drilling past the basic proficiency i
don't think brings much value but that's

6028
01:35:43,270 --> 01:35:43,280
don't think brings much value but that's
 

6029
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:44,550
don't think brings much value but that's
what i'm trying to tell you is i think

6030
01:35:44,550 --> 01:35:44,560
what i'm trying to tell you is i think
 

6031
01:35:44,560 --> 01:35:45,750
what i'm trying to tell you is i think
it does

6032
01:35:45,750 --> 01:35:45,760
it does
 

6033
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:49,510
it does
i think i think um

6034
01:35:49,510 --> 01:35:49,520

 

6035
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:51,830

if you're doing that same movement i

6036
01:35:51,830 --> 01:35:51,840
if you're doing that same movement i
 

6037
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:54,709
if you're doing that same movement i
think you begin to learn more over time

6038
01:35:54,709 --> 01:35:54,719
think you begin to learn more over time
 

6039
01:35:54,719 --> 01:35:56,149
think you begin to learn more over time
like you're saying like once you get the

6040
01:35:56,149 --> 01:35:56,159
like you're saying like once you get the
 

6041
01:35:56,159 --> 01:35:57,669
like you're saying like once you get the
basic proficiency

6042
01:35:57,669 --> 01:35:57,679
basic proficiency
 

6043
01:35:57,679 --> 01:35:59,990
basic proficiency
then there's uh diminishing returns i

6044
01:35:59,990 --> 01:36:00,000
then there's uh diminishing returns i
 

6045
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,430
then there's uh diminishing returns i
don't yeah so that's what i think i

6046
01:36:01,430 --> 01:36:01,440
don't yeah so that's what i think i
 

6047
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:03,189
don't yeah so that's what i think i
don't think so i think everything has

6048
01:36:03,189 --> 01:36:03,199
don't think so i think everything has
 

6049
01:36:03,199 --> 01:36:05,430
don't think so i think everything has
diminishing returns when you're learning

6050
01:36:05,430 --> 01:36:05,440
diminishing returns when you're learning
 

6051
01:36:05,440 --> 01:36:06,950
diminishing returns when you're learning
a technique but with something as

6052
01:36:06,950 --> 01:36:06,960
a technique but with something as
 

6053
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:10,550
a technique but with something as
complex as wrestling or grappling um if

6054
01:36:10,550 --> 01:36:10,560
complex as wrestling or grappling um if
 

6055
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:12,870
complex as wrestling or grappling um if
if you can have way more gains over here

6056
01:36:12,870 --> 01:36:12,880
if you can have way more gains over here
 

6057
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:16,550
if you can have way more gains over here
why focus on going from a 9.7 to a 9.8

6058
01:36:16,550 --> 01:36:16,560
why focus on going from a 9.7 to a 9.8
 

6059
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:18,709
why focus on going from a 9.7 to a 9.8
if you if this other area if you're

6060
01:36:18,709 --> 01:36:18,719
if you if this other area if you're
 

6061
01:36:18,719 --> 01:36:20,310
if you if this other area if you're
spending so much time here that there's

6062
01:36:20,310 --> 01:36:20,320
spending so much time here that there's
 

6063
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:21,990
spending so much time here that there's
other areas left unexplored you can make

6064
01:36:21,990 --> 01:36:22,000
other areas left unexplored you can make
 

6065
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:23,830
other areas left unexplored you can make
gigantic gains over there no but you're

6066
01:36:23,830 --> 01:36:23,840
gigantic gains over there no but you're
 

6067
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:25,030
gigantic gains over there no but you're
going to lose

6068
01:36:25,030 --> 01:36:25,040
going to lose
 

6069
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:27,910
going to lose
i i think a lot depends on your style i

6070
01:36:27,910 --> 01:36:27,920
i i think a lot depends on your style i
 

6071
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:30,470
i i think a lot depends on your style i
think a lot is determined by

6072
01:36:30,470 --> 01:36:30,480
think a lot is determined by
 

6073
01:36:30,480 --> 01:36:33,030
think a lot is determined by
how good you are at one thing

6074
01:36:33,030 --> 01:36:33,040
how good you are at one thing
 

6075
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:35,189
how good you are at one thing
and so if you want to become a master of

6076
01:36:35,189 --> 01:36:35,199
and so if you want to become a master of
 

6077
01:36:35,199 --> 01:36:37,109
and so if you want to become a master of
a particular thing and then make your

6078
01:36:37,109 --> 01:36:37,119
a particular thing and then make your
 

6079
01:36:37,119 --> 01:36:38,790
a particular thing and then make your
whole game where it's all pulled into

6080
01:36:38,790 --> 01:36:38,800
whole game where it's all pulled into
 

6081
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:41,430
whole game where it's all pulled into
that system then i don't know if one is

6082
01:36:41,430 --> 01:36:41,440
that system then i don't know if one is
 

6083
01:36:41,440 --> 01:36:43,669
that system then i don't know if one is
too small of a number not yeah it's

6084
01:36:43,669 --> 01:36:43,679
too small of a number not yeah it's
 

6085
01:36:43,679 --> 01:36:46,149
too small of a number not yeah it's
small i i feel like you can't be easily

6086
01:36:46,149 --> 01:36:46,159
small i i feel like you can't be easily
 

6087
01:36:46,159 --> 01:36:47,750
small i i feel like you can't be easily
this like

6088
01:36:47,750 --> 01:36:47,760
this like
 

6089
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:49,109
this like
yeah you want you want a funnel you want

6090
01:36:49,109 --> 01:36:49,119
yeah you want you want a funnel you want
 

6091
01:36:49,119 --> 01:36:51,109
yeah you want you want a funnel you want
to create funnels funnels funnels right

6092
01:36:51,109 --> 01:36:51,119
to create funnels funnels funnels right
 

6093
01:36:51,119 --> 01:36:52,149
to create funnels funnels funnels right
where everything goes into a few

6094
01:36:52,149 --> 01:36:52,159
where everything goes into a few
 

6095
01:36:52,159 --> 01:36:54,470
where everything goes into a few
positions and then it's all fields

6096
01:36:54,470 --> 01:36:54,480
positions and then it's all fields
 

6097
01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:56,950
positions and then it's all fields
yeah yeah but i feel

6098
01:36:56,950 --> 01:36:56,960
yeah yeah but i feel
 

6099
01:36:56,960 --> 01:36:59,350
yeah yeah but i feel
that you can get like

6100
01:36:59,350 --> 01:36:59,360
that you can get like
 

6101
01:36:59,360 --> 01:37:00,390
that you can get like
drilling

6102
01:37:00,390 --> 01:37:00,400
drilling
 

6103
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:02,229
drilling
on a dummy

6104
01:37:02,229 --> 01:37:02,239
on a dummy
 

6105
01:37:02,239 --> 01:37:05,350
on a dummy
80 of the time and 20 of the time live

6106
01:37:05,350 --> 01:37:05,360
80 of the time and 20 of the time live
 

6107
01:37:05,360 --> 01:37:08,470
80 of the time and 20 of the time live
rolling with people worse than you

6108
01:37:08,470 --> 01:37:08,480
rolling with people worse than you
 

6109
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:10,470
rolling with people worse than you
like a little bit worse than you or a

6110
01:37:10,470 --> 01:37:10,480
like a little bit worse than you or a
 

6111
01:37:10,480 --> 01:37:12,229
like a little bit worse than you or a
lot worse yeah so i think so i think i

6112
01:37:12,229 --> 01:37:12,239
lot worse yeah so i think so i think i
 

6113
01:37:12,239 --> 01:37:15,030
lot worse yeah so i think so i think i
definitely think so my my build up would

6114
01:37:15,030 --> 01:37:15,040
definitely think so my my build up would
 

6115
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:15,830
definitely think so my my build up would
be

6116
01:37:15,830 --> 01:37:15,840
be
 

6117
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:17,350
be
um

6118
01:37:17,350 --> 01:37:17,360
um
 

6119
01:37:17,360 --> 01:37:19,109
um
teach so we're talking complex technique

6120
01:37:19,109 --> 01:37:19,119
teach so we're talking complex technique
 

6121
01:37:19,119 --> 01:37:21,189
teach so we're talking complex technique
right so by the time we're talking about

6122
01:37:21,189 --> 01:37:21,199
right so by the time we're talking about
 

6123
01:37:21,199 --> 01:37:23,109
right so by the time we're talking about
we'll say a late high school kid who's

6124
01:37:23,109 --> 01:37:23,119
we'll say a late high school kid who's
 

6125
01:37:23,119 --> 01:37:25,510
we'll say a late high school kid who's
pretty proficient um he's probably done

6126
01:37:25,510 --> 01:37:25,520
pretty proficient um he's probably done
 

6127
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:28,070
pretty proficient um he's probably done
the drilling part so then now it's like

6128
01:37:28,070 --> 01:37:28,080
the drilling part so then now it's like
 

6129
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:29,669
the drilling part so then now it's like
okay if i want to get something new to

6130
01:37:29,669 --> 01:37:29,679
okay if i want to get something new to
 

6131

probably do the basic premise within
 

6135
01:37:33,119 --> 01:37:34,629
probably do the basic premise within
five to ten minutes if they're good

6136
01:37:34,629 --> 01:37:34,639
five to ten minutes if they're good
 

6137
01:37:34,639 --> 01:37:37,030
five to ten minutes if they're good
right do this okay they do it then it's

get good you have to get all the way
 

6167
01:37:56,800 --> 01:37:58,229
get good you have to get all the way
through the tech why do you need them to

6168
01:37:58,229 --> 01:37:58,239
through the tech why do you need them to
 

6169
01:37:58,239 --> 01:38:00,149
through the tech why do you need them to
complete just so they gain confidence in

6170
01:38:00,149 --> 01:38:00,159
complete just so they gain confidence in
 

6171
01:38:00,159 --> 01:38:02,470
complete just so they gain confidence in
the technique or they go they have to

6172
01:38:02,470 --> 01:38:02,480
the technique or they go they have to
 

6173

feel all the way through like if i said
 

6175
01:38:05,119 --> 01:38:06,470
feel all the way through like if i said
learn a high crotch

01:38:06,470 --> 01:38:06,480
learn a high crotch
 

6177
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:07,669
learn a high crotch
when you're drilling with stop halfway

6178
01:38:07,669 --> 01:38:07,679
when you're drilling with stop halfway
 

6179
01:38:07,679 --> 01:38:09,830
when you're drilling with stop halfway
every time but you're not actually gonna

6180
01:38:09,830 --> 01:38:09,840
every time but you're not actually gonna
 

6181
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:10,870
every time but you're not actually gonna
be able to do it because you're gonna

6182
01:38:10,870 --> 01:38:10,880
be able to do it because you're gonna
 

6183
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:12,550
be able to do it because you're gonna
stop you're gonna feel

6184
01:38:12,550 --> 01:38:12,560
stop you're gonna feel
 

6185
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:14,629
stop you're gonna feel
so you know try it on someone spar

6186
01:38:14,629 --> 01:38:14,639
so you know try it on someone spar
 

6187
01:38:14,639 --> 01:38:16,870
so you know try it on someone spar
lightly get it do it on someone who's

6188
01:38:16,870 --> 01:38:16,880
lightly get it do it on someone who's
 

6189
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:19,270
lightly get it do it on someone who's
not as good you get it then kind of work

6190
01:38:19,270 --> 01:38:19,280
not as good you get it then kind of work
 

6191
01:38:19,280 --> 01:38:20,550
not as good you get it then kind of work
your way up the ladder until you can get

6192
01:38:20,550 --> 01:38:20,560
your way up the ladder until you can get
 

6193
01:38:20,560 --> 01:38:21,830
your way up the ladder until you can get
it on someone your own skill level or

6194
01:38:21,830 --> 01:38:21,840
it on someone your own skill level or
 

6195
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:24,149
it on someone your own skill level or
maybe better than you right in in a live

6196
01:38:24,149 --> 01:38:24,159
maybe better than you right in in a live
 

6197
01:38:24,159 --> 01:38:26,229
maybe better than you right in in a live
competition so it's like i don't know i

6198
01:38:26,229 --> 01:38:26,239
competition so it's like i don't know i
 

6199
01:38:26,239 --> 01:38:28,310
competition so it's like i don't know i
feel like that that basic drilling like

6200
01:38:28,310 --> 01:38:28,320
feel like that that basic drilling like
 

6201
01:38:28,320 --> 01:38:29,910
feel like that that basic drilling like
um so a kid like keegan who i brought a

6202
01:38:29,910 --> 01:38:29,920
um so a kid like keegan who i brought a
 

6203
01:38:29,920 --> 01:38:31,669
um so a kid like keegan who i brought a
few times like i feel like if there's

6204
01:38:31,669 --> 01:38:31,679
few times like i feel like if there's

time and they know how to work hard and

6982
01:50:58,790 --> 01:50:58,800
time and they know how to work hard and
 

6983
01:50:58,800 --> 01:50:59,910
time and they know how to work hard and
that's going to get you a really long

6984
01:50:59,910 --> 01:50:59,920
that's going to get you a really long
 

6985
01:50:59,920 --> 01:51:02,070
that's going to get you a really long
way just those two things right not even

6986
01:51:02,070 --> 01:51:02,080
way just those two things right not even
 

6987
01:51:02,080 --> 01:51:03,750
way just those two things right not even
the techniques it's just the disciplines

6988
01:51:03,750 --> 01:51:03,760
the techniques it's just the disciplines
 

6989
01:51:03,760 --> 01:51:05,270
the techniques it's just the disciplines
those things then i think you throw on

6990
01:51:05,270 --> 01:51:05,280
those things then i think you throw on
 

6991
01:51:05,280 --> 01:51:07,030
those things then i think you throw on
top of the fact that most of us have

6992
01:51:07,030 --> 01:51:07,040
top of the fact that most of us have
 

6993
01:51:07,040 --> 01:51:08,390
top of the fact that most of us have
competed

6994
01:51:08,390 --> 01:51:08,400
competed
 

6995
01:51:08,400 --> 01:51:10,550
competed
1500 to 2000 times probably by the time

6996
01:51:10,550 --> 01:51:10,560
1500 to 2000 times probably by the time
 

6997
01:51:10,560 --> 01:51:12,629
1500 to 2000 times probably by the time
we get to 20 something like that's a

6998
01:51:12,629 --> 01:51:12,639
we get to 20 something like that's a
 

6999
01:51:12,639 --> 01:51:13,910
we get to 20 something like that's a
huge advantage too most of these other

7000
01:51:13,910 --> 01:51:13,920
huge advantage too most of these other
 

7001
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:15,750
huge advantage too most of these other
people from other disciplines maybe have

7002
01:51:15,750 --> 01:51:15,760
people from other disciplines maybe have
 

7003
01:51:15,760 --> 01:51:18,310
people from other disciplines maybe have
completed 100 if if that right so we

7004
01:51:18,310 --> 01:51:18,320
completed 100 if if that right so we
 

7005
01:51:18,320 --> 01:51:20,229
completed 100 if if that right so we
have this competitive process down

7006
01:51:20,229 --> 01:51:20,239
have this competitive process down
 

7007
01:51:20,239 --> 01:51:22,470
have this competitive process down
really really really really well

7008
01:51:22,470 --> 01:51:22,480
really really really really well
 

7009
01:51:22,480 --> 01:51:24,629
really really really really well
um plus the weight cut the weight cut

7010

7013
01:51:25,840 --> 01:51:27,990
there's all these things right that
factor into it um i think the fact that

7014
01:51:27,990 --> 01:51:28,000
factor into it um i think the fact that
 

7015
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:29,750
factor into it um i think the fact that
we're really open-minded like i think if

and bang thing you know where they want
 

7137
01:53:17,920 --> 01:53:20,709
and bang thing you know where they want
to you know show how macho they are um

7138
01:53:20,709 --> 01:53:20,719
to you know show how macho they are um
 

7139
01:53:20,719 --> 01:53:22,790
to you know show how macho they are um
but yeah that was a frustrating one that

7140
01:53:22,790 --> 01:53:22,800
but yeah that was a frustrating one that
 

7141
01:53:22,800 --> 01:53:24,950
but yeah that was a frustrating one that
they it there's a lot of wrestlers who

7142
01:53:24,950 --> 01:53:24,960
they it there's a lot of wrestlers who
 

7143
01:53:24,960 --> 01:53:27,189
they it there's a lot of wrestlers who
became highly proficient in jiu jitsu

7144
01:53:27,189 --> 01:53:27,199
became highly proficient in jiu jitsu
 

7145
01:53:27,199 --> 01:53:29,030
became highly proficient in jiu jitsu
and really adapted and it doesn't go the

7146
01:53:29,030 --> 01:53:29,040
and really adapted and it doesn't go the
 

7147
01:53:29,040 --> 01:53:30,229
and really adapted and it doesn't go the
other way and then i guess the other

7148
01:53:30,229 --> 01:53:30,239
other way and then i guess the other
 

7149
01:53:30,239 --> 01:53:33,109
other way and then i guess the other
thing there too is um

7150
01:53:33,109 --> 01:53:33,119
thing there too is um
 

7151
01:53:33,119 --> 01:53:34,629
thing there too is um
they can both steal from each other

7152
01:53:34,629 --> 01:53:34,639
they can both steal from each other
 

7153
01:53:34,639 --> 01:53:35,830
they can both steal from each other
right as

7154
01:53:35,830 --> 01:53:35,840
right as
 

7155
01:53:35,840 --> 01:53:38,629
right as
any martial art can steal from another

7156
01:53:38,629 --> 01:53:38,639
any martial art can steal from another
 

7157
01:53:38,639 --> 01:53:40,709
any martial art can steal from another
and like i feel like jujitsu didn't do

7158
01:53:40,709 --> 01:53:40,719
and like i feel like jujitsu didn't do
 

7159
01:53:40,719 --> 01:53:42,470
and like i feel like jujitsu didn't do
enough stealing from wrestling like they

7160
01:53:42,470 --> 01:53:42,480
enough stealing from wrestling like they
 

7161
01:53:42,480 --> 01:53:43,589
enough stealing from wrestling like they
should have looked at all the wrestling

7162
01:53:43,589 --> 01:53:43,599
should have looked at all the wrestling
 

7163
01:53:43,599 --> 01:53:44,790
should have looked at all the wrestling
possible and said

7164
01:53:44,790 --> 01:53:44,800
possible and said
 

7165
01:53:44,800 --> 01:53:46,629
possible and said
well why why don't we steal that and

7166
01:53:46,629 --> 01:53:46,639
well why why don't we steal that and
 

7167
01:53:46,639 --> 01:53:48,070
well why why don't we steal that and
that and that you know and like hey

7168
01:53:48,070 --> 01:53:48,080
that and that you know and like hey
 

7169
01:53:48,080 --> 01:53:49,510
that and that you know and like hey
let's take that over and maybe we'd make

7170
01:53:49,510 --> 01:53:49,520
let's take that over and maybe we'd make
 

7171
01:53:49,520 --> 01:53:52,149
let's take that over and maybe we'd make
a little tweak because it's different

7172
01:53:52,149 --> 01:53:52,159
a little tweak because it's different
 

7173
01:53:52,159 --> 01:53:53,350
a little tweak because it's different
but there's something we can definitely

7174
01:53:53,350 --> 01:53:53,360
but there's something we can definitely
 

7175
01:53:53,360 --> 01:53:56,629
but there's something we can definitely
use there so like in wrestling

7176
01:53:56,629 --> 01:53:56,639
use there so like in wrestling
 

7177
01:53:56,639 --> 01:53:57,750
use there so like in wrestling
for example you know there's a one-armed

7178
01:53:57,750 --> 01:53:57,760
for example you know there's a one-armed
 

7179
01:53:57,760 --> 01:53:59,510
for example you know there's a one-armed
guillotine in jujitsu right

7180
01:53:59,510 --> 01:53:59,520
guillotine in jujitsu right
 

7181
01:53:59,520 --> 01:54:01,189
guillotine in jujitsu right

01:54:31,440 --> 01:54:33,830
you go it's got different names um
so i would always i would say like

7220
01:54:33,830 --> 01:54:33,840
so i would always i would say like
 

7221
01:54:33,840 --> 01:54:36,070
so i would always i would say like
pre-jiu-jitsu i was i was average at it

7222
01:54:36,070 --> 01:54:36,080
pre-jiu-jitsu i was i was average at it
 

7223
01:54:36,080 --> 01:54:37,830
pre-jiu-jitsu i was i was average at it
like i could do it i but against good

7224
01:54:37,830 --> 01:54:37,840
like i could do it i but against good
 

7225
01:54:37,840 --> 01:54:40,229
like i could do it i but against good
people you'd never get it first because

7226
01:54:40,229 --> 01:54:40,239
people you'd never get it first because
 

7227
01:54:40,239 --> 01:54:41,430
people you'd never get it first because
i'll tell you what exactly because they

7228
01:54:41,430 --> 01:54:41,440
i'll tell you what exactly because they
 

7229
01:54:41,440 --> 01:54:42,470
i'll tell you what exactly because they
would get the back of their head up and

7230
01:54:42,470 --> 01:54:42,480
would get the back of their head up and
 

7231
01:54:42,480 --> 01:54:43,510
would get the back of their head up and
they're too strong where you couldn't

7232
01:54:43,510 --> 01:54:43,520
they're too strong where you couldn't
 

7233
01:54:43,520 --> 01:54:44,870
they're too strong where you couldn't
collapse them by going over their neck

7234
01:54:44,870 --> 01:54:44,880
collapse them by going over their neck
 

7235
01:54:44,880 --> 01:54:46,470
collapse them by going over their neck
right because the forces weren't right

7236
01:54:46,470 --> 01:54:46,480
right because the forces weren't right
 

7237
01:54:46,480 --> 01:54:48,070
right because the forces weren't right
so then in jiu jitsu you learn the one

7238
01:54:48,070 --> 01:54:48,080
so then in jiu jitsu you learn the one
 

7239
01:54:48,080 --> 01:54:49,589
so then in jiu jitsu you learn the one
arm guillotine where you grab their chin

7240
01:54:49,589 --> 01:54:49,599
arm guillotine where you grab their chin
 

7241
01:54:49,599 --> 01:54:51,270
arm guillotine where you grab their chin
and this is more of running along the

7242
01:54:51,270 --> 01:54:51,280
and this is more of running along the
 

7243
01:54:51,280 --> 01:54:52,950
and this is more of running along the
side of their head and then and then you

7244
01:54:52,950 --> 01:54:52,960
side of their head and then and then you
 

7245
01:54:52,960 --> 01:54:55,589
side of their head and then and then you
go here and you choke them right

7246
01:54:55,589 --> 01:54:55,599
go here and you choke them right
 

7247
01:54:55,599 --> 01:54:57,270
go here and you choke them right
much more efficient way to move their

7248
01:54:57,270 --> 01:54:57,280
much more efficient way to move their
 

7249
01:54:57,280 --> 01:54:59,350
much more efficient way to move their
head because the fulcrum is way down

7250
01:54:59,350 --> 01:54:59,360
head because the fulcrum is way down
 

7251
01:54:59,360 --> 01:55:02,229
head because the fulcrum is way down
here and their head can move into that

7252
01:55:02,229 --> 01:55:02,239
here and their head can move into that
 

7253
01:55:02,239 --> 01:55:03,990
here and their head can move into that
right so once i learned that in jiu

7254
01:55:03,990 --> 01:55:04,000
right so once i learned that in jiu
 

7255
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,070
right so once i learned that in jiu
jitsu i'm like wait

7256
01:55:06,070 --> 01:55:06,080
jitsu i'm like wait
 

7257
01:55:06,080 --> 01:55:07,750
jitsu i'm like wait
i can do this in wrestling

7258
01:55:07,750 --> 01:55:07,760
i can do this in wrestling
 

7259
01:55:07,760 --> 01:55:09,270
i can do this in wrestling
so now once i learn how to grab their

7260
01:55:09,270 --> 01:55:09,280
so now once i learn how to grab their
 

7261
01:55:09,280 --> 01:55:10,629
so now once i learn how to grab their
chin the right way and i do the honey

7262
01:55:10,629 --> 01:55:10,639
chin the right way and i do the honey
 

7263
01:55:10,639 --> 01:55:12,870
chin the right way and i do the honey
badger no one ever gets out i just had

7264
01:55:12,870 --> 01:55:12,880
badger no one ever gets out i just had
 

7265

that's ripe for the stealing because uh
 

7283
01:55:33,199 --> 01:55:36,310
that's ripe for the stealing because uh
judo is much more emphasizes uh

sort of
primal mechanism of proof-of-work and

people don't understand that american

7684
02:01:59,350 --> 02:01:59,360
people don't understand that american
 

7685

people don't really understand the
 

7687
02:02:00,320 --> 02:02:02,149

unbanked right a decent portion of the

7688
02:02:02,149 --> 02:02:02,159
unbanked right a decent portion of the
 

7689
02:02:02,159 --> 02:02:03,990
unbanked right a decent portion of the
world is unbanked they don't have access

7690
02:02:03,990 --> 02:02:04,000
world is unbanked they don't have access
 

7691
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,310
world is unbanked they don't have access
to it and a much much much smaller

7692
02:02:06,310 --> 02:02:06,320
to it and a much much much smaller
 

7693
02:02:06,320 --> 02:02:08,070
to it and a much much much smaller
portion of the world doesn't have access

7694
02:02:08,070 --> 02:02:08,080
portion of the world doesn't have access
 

7695
02:02:08,080 --> 02:02:09,990
portion of the world doesn't have access
to internet so if i can put a mobile

7696
02:02:09,990 --> 02:02:10,000
to internet so if i can put a mobile
 

7697
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,709
to internet so if i can put a mobile
wallet on your phone and we can send

7698
02:02:12,709 --> 02:02:12,719
wallet on your phone and we can send
 

7699
02:02:12,719 --> 02:02:14,070
wallet on your phone and we can send
money person to person so there's a

7700
02:02:14,070 --> 02:02:14,080
money person to person so there's a
 

7701
02:02:14,080 --> 02:02:15,030
money person to person so there's a
whole bunch of those problems where

7702
02:02:15,030 --> 02:02:15,040
whole bunch of those problems where
 

7703
02:02:15,040 --> 02:02:16,790
whole bunch of those problems where
americans don't really think about that

7704
02:02:16,790 --> 02:02:16,800
americans don't really think about that
 

7705
02:02:16,800 --> 02:02:19,189
americans don't really think about that
are really obvious that this solves

7706
02:02:19,189 --> 02:02:19,199
are really obvious that this solves
 

7707
02:02:19,199 --> 02:02:21,270
are really obvious that this solves
um so i think that's the key one

7708
02:02:21,270 --> 02:02:21,280
um so i think that's the key one
 

7709
02:02:21,280 --> 02:02:23,270
um so i think that's the key one
obviously the fact that i'm

7710
02:02:23,270 --> 02:02:23,280
obviously the fact that i'm
 

7711
02:02:23,280 --> 02:02:25,350
obviously the fact that i'm
the value goes up is really outstanding

7712
02:02:25,350 --> 02:02:25,360
the value goes up is really outstanding
 

7713
02:02:25,360 --> 02:02:27,830
the value goes up is really outstanding
also but i but if you look at it

7714
02:02:27,830 --> 02:02:27,840
also but i but if you look at it
 

7715
02:02:27,840 --> 02:02:31,030
also but i but if you look at it
yeah i got in in 2017 so i got to watch

7716
02:02:31,030 --> 02:02:31,040
yeah i got in in 2017 so i got to watch
 

7717
02:02:31,040 --> 02:02:33,030
yeah i got in in 2017 so i got to watch
it go up i didn't sell [\h__\h] at the top

7718
02:02:33,030 --> 02:02:33,040
it go up i didn't sell [\h__\h] at the top
 

7719
02:02:33,040 --> 02:02:35,109
it go up i didn't sell [\h__\h] at the top
really stupid and then the majority of

7720
02:02:35,109 --> 02:02:35,119
really stupid and then the majority of
 

7721
02:02:35,119 --> 02:02:36,550
really stupid and then the majority of
my time was spent through the bear

7722
02:02:36,550 --> 02:02:36,560
my time was spent through the bear
 

7723
02:02:36,560 --> 02:02:38,550
my time was spent through the bear
market and so i had to love it for the

7724
02:02:38,550 --> 02:02:38,560
market and so i had to love it for the
 

7725
02:02:38,560 --> 02:02:40,310
market and so i had to love it for the
principles that it provided not the fact

7726
02:02:40,310 --> 02:02:40,320
principles that it provided not the fact
 

7727
02:02:40,320 --> 02:02:42,070
principles that it provided not the fact
that actually i actually lost money in

7728
02:02:42,070 --> 02:02:42,080
that actually i actually lost money in
 

7729
02:02:42,080 --> 02:02:44,550
that actually i actually lost money in
the beginning and not now i'm way up but

7730
02:02:44,550 --> 02:02:44,560
the beginning and not now i'm way up but
 

7731
02:02:44,560 --> 02:02:47,350
the beginning and not now i'm way up but
um yeah so you're just holding just

7732
02:02:47,350 --> 02:02:47,360
um yeah so you're just holding just
 

7733
02:02:47,360 --> 02:02:49,669
um yeah so you're just holding just
holding i think at the top of this bull

7734
02:02:49,669 --> 02:02:49,679
holding i think at the top of this bull
 

7735
02:02:49,679 --> 02:02:51,910
holding i think at the top of this bull
market i'll probably sell a very small

7736
02:02:51,910 --> 02:02:51,920
market i'll probably sell a very small
 

7737
02:02:51,920 --> 02:02:52,950
market i'll probably sell a very small
portion

7738
02:02:52,950 --> 02:02:52,960
portion
 

7739
02:02:52,960 --> 02:02:54,629
portion
um just so you mean like right now

7740
02:02:54,629 --> 02:02:54,639
um just so you mean like right now
 

7741
02:02:54,639 --> 02:02:56,070
um just so you mean like right now
there's a bull market

7742
02:02:56,070 --> 02:02:56,080
there's a bull market
 

7743
02:02:56,080 --> 02:02:57,910
there's a bull market
yeah most most people think say in the

7744
02:02:57,910 --> 02:02:57,920
yeah most most people think say in the
 

7745
02:02:57,920 --> 02:02:59,270
yeah most most people think say in the
next three to six months will be at the

7746
02:02:59,270 --> 02:02:59,280
next three to six months will be at the
 

7747
02:02:59,280 --> 02:03:01,270
next three to six months will be at the
top of the market and so probably when

7748
02:03:01,270 --> 02:03:01,280
top of the market and so probably when
 

7749
02:03:01,280 --> 02:03:03,109
top of the market and so probably when
that happens uh i'll probably sell a

7750
02:03:03,109 --> 02:03:03,119
that happens uh i'll probably sell a
 

7751
02:03:03,119 --> 02:03:04,629
that happens uh i'll probably sell a
little bit

7752
02:03:04,629 --> 02:03:04,639
little bit
 

7753
02:03:04,639 --> 02:03:06,629
little bit
you gotta huddle it ben you got a hot

02:10:46,149 --> 02:10:46,159
almost like to me it's almost like
 

8245
02:10:46,159 --> 02:10:47,750
almost like to me it's almost like
was he successful

was he successful
 

8247
02:10:47,760 --> 02:10:50,550
was he successful
despite that not because of that right

8248
02:10:50,550 --> 02:10:50,560
despite that not because of that right

that i have to do uh i don't know let
 

8313
02:11:55,920 --> 02:11:57,350
that i have to do uh i don't know let
you in front of a lot of people yeah

8314
02:11:57,350 --> 02:11:57,360
you in front of a lot of people yeah
 

8315
02:11:57,360 --> 02:11:58,870
you in front of a lot of people yeah
that would be a great example

8316
02:11:58,870 --> 02:11:58,880
that would be a great example
 

8317
02:11:58,880 --> 02:12:01,030
that would be a great example
that there's huge amount of anxiety

8318
02:12:01,030 --> 02:12:01,040
that there's huge amount of anxiety

weeks ahead days ahead hours ahead so

8320
02:12:03,830 --> 02:12:03,840
weeks ahead days ahead hours ahead so
 

8321
02:12:03,840 --> 02:12:07,030
weeks ahead days ahead hours ahead so
you have a system to get rid of it then

8322
02:12:07,030 --> 02:12:07,040
you have a system to get rid of it then
 

8323
02:12:07,040 --> 02:12:09,270
you have a system to get rid of it then
maybe but it's just the body gets rid of

8324
02:12:09,270 --> 02:12:09,280
maybe but it's just the body gets rid of
 

8325
02:12:09,280 --> 02:12:11,430
maybe but it's just the body gets rid of
it somehow yeah there's not a system

8326
02:12:11,430 --> 02:12:11,440
it somehow yeah there's not a system
 

8327
02:12:11,440 --> 02:12:13,830
it somehow yeah there's not a system
subconscious system yeah it's so you

8328
02:12:13,830 --> 02:12:13,840
subconscious system yeah it's so you
 

8329
02:12:13,840 --> 02:12:15,669
subconscious system yeah it's so you
don't you don't actually have anxiety

8330
02:12:15,669 --> 02:12:15,679
don't you don't actually have anxiety
 

8331
02:12:15,679 --> 02:12:18,229
don't you don't actually have anxiety
while you're performing so that's like

8332
02:12:18,229 --> 02:12:18,239
while you're performing so that's like
 

8333
02:12:18,239 --> 02:12:20,470
while you're performing so that's like
so then that problem somehow that

8334
02:12:20,470 --> 02:12:20,480
so then that problem somehow that
 

8335
02:12:20,480 --> 02:12:21,910
so then that problem somehow that
problem has solved itself right the

8336
02:12:21,910 --> 02:12:21,920
problem has solved itself right the
 

8337
02:12:21,920 --> 02:12:23,430
problem has solved itself right the
problem is when the anxiety is actually

8338
02:12:23,430 --> 02:12:23,440
problem is when the anxiety is actually
 

8339
02:12:23,440 --> 02:12:25,350
problem is when the anxiety is actually
happening while the wrestling match is

8340
02:12:25,350 --> 02:12:25,360
happening while the wrestling match is
 

8341
02:12:25,360 --> 02:12:27,990
happening while the wrestling match is
happening that's the real issue yeah but

8342
02:12:27,990 --> 02:12:28,000
happening that's the real issue yeah but
 

8343
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,390
happening that's the real issue yeah but
it's it like sneaks in there too is

8344
02:12:30,390 --> 02:12:30,400
it's it like sneaks in there too is

8356
02:12:45,030 --> 02:12:45,040
like the there's other things we have to
 

8357
02:12:45,040 --> 02:12:46,390
like the there's other things we have to

you can catch yourself thinking like in

8362
02:12:49,669 --> 02:12:49,679
you can catch yourself thinking like in
 

8363
02:12:49,679 --> 02:12:51,750
you can catch yourself thinking like in
this conversation you know yeah like

8364
02:12:51,750 --> 02:12:51,760
this conversation you know yeah like
 

8365
02:12:51,760 --> 02:12:53,350
this conversation you know yeah like
i'll i've said a bunch of stuff where i

8366
02:12:53,350 --> 02:12:53,360
i'll i've said a bunch of stuff where i
 

8367
02:12:53,360 --> 02:12:54,149
i'll i've said a bunch of stuff where i
think

8368
02:12:54,149 --> 02:12:54,159
think
 

8369
02:12:54,159 --> 02:12:55,830
think
why the hell would you say that that's

8370
02:12:55,830 --> 02:12:55,840
why the hell would you say that that's
 

8371
02:12:55,840 --> 02:12:58,149
why the hell would you say that that's
dumb right that that's the anxiety

8372
02:12:58,149 --> 02:12:58,159
dumb right that that's the anxiety
 

8373
02:12:58,159 --> 02:13:00,069
dumb right that that's the anxiety
because there's a pause

8374
02:13:00,069 --> 02:13:00,079
because there's a pause
