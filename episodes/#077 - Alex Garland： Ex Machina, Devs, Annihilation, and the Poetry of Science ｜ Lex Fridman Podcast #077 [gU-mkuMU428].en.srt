183
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,330

00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:00,490
do you think we might be living in a

dream or in a simulation like the kind
 

195
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,230

00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:08,580
we human beings here today yeah I want

00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,130

to sort of separate that out into two

200
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:10,140
to sort of separate that out into two
 

201
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:13,220
to sort of separate that out into two
things yes I think we're living in a

202
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:13,230
things yes I think we're living in a
 

203
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:16,850
things yes I think we're living in a
dream of sorts no I don't think we're

204
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:16,860
dream of sorts no I don't think we're
 

205
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,490
dream of sorts no I don't think we're
living in a simulation I think we're

206
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:19,500
living in a simulation I think we're
 

207
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,520
living in a simulation I think we're
living on a planet with a very thin

208
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:22,530
living on a planet with a very thin
 

209
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:24,920
living on a planet with a very thin
layer of atmosphere and the planet is in

210
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:24,930
layer of atmosphere and the planet is in
 

211
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:28,580
layer of atmosphere and the planet is in
a very large space and the space is full

212
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:28,590
a very large space and the space is full
 

213
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:30,320
a very large space and the space is full
of other planets and stars and quasars

214
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:30,330
of other planets and stars and quasars
 

215
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:32,240
of other planets and stars and quasars
and stuff like that and I don't think I

216
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:32,250
and stuff like that and I don't think I
 

217
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:35,360
and stuff like that and I don't think I
don't think those physical objects I

218
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:35,370
don't think those physical objects I
 

219
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:37,720
don't think those physical objects I
don't in the matter in that universe is

220
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:37,730
don't in the matter in that universe is
 

221
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:41,230
don't in the matter in that universe is
simulated I think it's there we are

222
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:41,240
simulated I think it's there we are
 

223
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,770
simulated I think it's there we are
definitely Soho problem is saying

224
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:45,780
definitely Soho problem is saying
 

225
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,800
definitely Soho problem is saying
definitely but in my opinion just about

226
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:48,810
definitely but in my opinion just about
 

227
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:52,040
definitely but in my opinion just about
that we I think it seems very like we're

228
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,050
that we I think it seems very like we're
 

229
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,570
that we I think it seems very like we're
living in a dream state I'm pretty sure

230
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:53,580
living in a dream state I'm pretty sure
 

231
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,700
living in a dream state I'm pretty sure
we are and I think that's just to do

232
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:55,710
we are and I think that's just to do
 

233
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:57,680
we are and I think that's just to do
with the nature of how we experience the

234
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:57,690
with the nature of how we experience the
 

235
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:59,950
with the nature of how we experience the
world we experience in a subjective way

236
00:04:59,950 --> 00:04:59,960
world we experience in a subjective way
 

237
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:04,490
world we experience in a subjective way
and the the thing I've learned most as

238
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:04,500
and the the thing I've learned most as
 

239
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,430
and the the thing I've learned most as
I've got older in some respects is is

240
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:07,440
I've got older in some respects is is
 

241
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,350
I've got older in some respects is is
the degree to which reality is

242
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:09,360
the degree to which reality is
 

243
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,480
the degree to which reality is
counterintuitive and that the things

244
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:11,490
counterintuitive and that the things
 

245
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:13,580
counterintuitive and that the things
that are presented to us as objective

246
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:13,590
that are presented to us as objective
 

247
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:15,620
that are presented to us as objective
turn out not to be objective and quantum

248
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:15,630
turn out not to be objective and quantum
 

249
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:17,270
turn out not to be objective and quantum
mechanics is full of that kind of thing

250
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:17,280
mechanics is full of that kind of thing
 

251
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,070
mechanics is full of that kind of thing
but actually just day-to-day life is

252
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:19,080
but actually just day-to-day life is
 

253
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,520
but actually just day-to-day life is
full of that kind of thing as well so so

254
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:22,530
full of that kind of thing as well so so
 

255
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:25,910
full of that kind of thing as well so so
my understanding of the way the way the

256
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:25,920
my understanding of the way the way the
 

257
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,970
my understanding of the way the way the
brain works is you you get some

258
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:28,980
brain works is you you get some
 

259
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,800
brain works is you you get some
information hit your optic nerve and

260
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:30,810
information hit your optic nerve and
 

261
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:32,480
information hit your optic nerve and
then your brain makes its best guess

262
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:32,490
then your brain makes its best guess
 

263
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,460
then your brain makes its best guess
about what it's seeing or what it's

264
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:34,470
about what it's seeing or what it's
 

265
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:37,430
about what it's seeing or what it's
saying it's seeing it may or may not be

266
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:37,440
saying it's seeing it may or may not be
 

267
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,770
saying it's seeing it may or may not be
an accurate best guess it might be an

268
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:39,780
an accurate best guess it might be an
 

269
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,680
an accurate best guess it might be an
inaccurate best guess and that that gap

270
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:42,690
inaccurate best guess and that that gap
 

271
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:46,370
inaccurate best guess and that that gap
the best guess gap means that we are

272
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:46,380
the best guess gap means that we are
 

273
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,830
the best guess gap means that we are
essentially living in a subjective state

274
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:48,840
essentially living in a subjective state
 

275
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,450
essentially living in a subjective state
which means that we're in a dream state

276
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:50,460
which means that we're in a dream state
 

277
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,360
which means that we're in a dream state
so I I think you could enlarge on the

278
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:53,370
so I I think you could enlarge on the
 

279
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:55,550
so I I think you could enlarge on the
dream state in all sorts of ways but so

280
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:55,560
dream state in all sorts of ways but so
 

281
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,580
dream state in all sorts of ways but so
yes dream state no simulation would be

282
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:58,590
yes dream state no simulation would be
 

283
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:02,150
yes dream state no simulation would be
where I'd come down said going further

284
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:02,160
where I'd come down said going further
 

285
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,890
where I'd come down said going further
deeper into that direction

286
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:03,900
deeper into that direction
 

287
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,580
deeper into that direction
you've also described that world as

288
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:06,590
you've also described that world as
 

289
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:10,220
you've also described that world as
psychedelia so on that topic I'm curious

290
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:10,230
psychedelia so on that topic I'm curious
 

291
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:12,200
psychedelia so on that topic I'm curious
about that world on the topic of

292
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:12,210
about that world on the topic of
 

293
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:15,320
about that world on the topic of
psychedelic drugs do you see those kinds

294
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:15,330
psychedelic drugs do you see those kinds
 

295
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:17,030
psychedelic drugs do you see those kinds
of chemicals that modify our

296
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:17,040
of chemicals that modify our
 

297
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:21,440
of chemicals that modify our
option as a distortion of our perception

298
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:21,450
option as a distortion of our perception
 

299
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:24,970
option as a distortion of our perception
reality or a window into another reality

300
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:24,980
reality or a window into another reality
 

301
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,470
reality or a window into another reality
no I think what I'd be saying is that we

302
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:27,480
no I think what I'd be saying is that we
 

303
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,360
no I think what I'd be saying is that we
live in a distorted reality and then

304
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:29,370
live in a distorted reality and then
 

305
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:31,250
live in a distorted reality and then
those kinds of drugs give us a different

306
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:31,260
those kinds of drugs give us a different
 

307
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,500
those kinds of drugs give us a different
kind of distorted active yeah exactly

308
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:33,510
kind of distorted active yeah exactly
 

309
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,660
kind of distorted active yeah exactly
they just give an alternate Distortion

310
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:35,670
they just give an alternate Distortion
 

311
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:37,580
they just give an alternate Distortion
and I think that what they really do is

312
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:37,590
and I think that what they really do is
 

313
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:40,220
and I think that what they really do is
they give they give a distorted

314
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:40,230
they give they give a distorted
 

315
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:42,140
they give they give a distorted
perception which is a little bit more

316
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:42,150
perception which is a little bit more
 

317
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:46,520
perception which is a little bit more
halide to daydreams or unconscious

318
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:46,530
halide to daydreams or unconscious
 

319
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:49,190
halide to daydreams or unconscious
interests so if for some reason you're

320
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:49,200
interests so if for some reason you're
 

321
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,350
interests so if for some reason you're
feeling unconsciously anxious at that

322
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:51,360
feeling unconsciously anxious at that
 

323
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,910
feeling unconsciously anxious at that
moment and you take a psychedelic drug

324
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:52,920
moment and you take a psychedelic drug
 

325
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,060
moment and you take a psychedelic drug
you'll have a more pronounced unpleasant

326
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:56,070
you'll have a more pronounced unpleasant
 

327
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,170
you'll have a more pronounced unpleasant
experience and if you're feeling very

328
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:57,180
experience and if you're feeling very
 

329
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:00,820
experience and if you're feeling very
calm or or happy my have a good time but

330
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:00,830
calm or or happy my have a good time but
 

331
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:03,860
calm or or happy my have a good time but
but yeah so if I'm saying we're starting

332
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:03,870
but yeah so if I'm saying we're starting
 

333
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:06,080
but yeah so if I'm saying we're starting
from a premise our starting point is or

334
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:06,090
from a premise our starting point is or
 

335
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:08,240
from a premise our starting point is or
we were already in the slightly

336
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:08,250
we were already in the slightly
 

337
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:11,330
we were already in the slightly
psychedelic state you what those drugs

338
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:11,340
psychedelic state you what those drugs
 

339
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,280
psychedelic state you what those drugs
do is help you go further down an avenue

340
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:13,290
do is help you go further down an avenue
 

341
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:14,870
do is help you go further down an avenue
or it may be a slightly different Avenue

342
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:14,880
or it may be a slightly different Avenue
 

343
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,960
or it may be a slightly different Avenue
but that's what so in in a movie

344
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:17,970
but that's what so in in a movie
 

345
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:22,550
but that's what so in in a movie
annihilation the the shimmer this

346
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:22,560
annihilation the the shimmer this
 

347
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,700
annihilation the the shimmer this
alternate dreamlike state is created by

348
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:25,710
alternate dreamlike state is created by

00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:29,450
alternate dreamlike state is created by
I believe perhaps an alien entity of

00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:29,460
I believe perhaps an alien entity of

00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,530
I believe perhaps an alien entity of
course everything is up to

00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:30,540
course everything is up to
 

353
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:33,050
course everything is up to
interpretation right but do you think

354
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:33,060
interpretation right but do you think
 

355
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:36,230
interpretation right but do you think
there's in our world in our universe do

356
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:36,240
there's in our world in our universe do
 

357
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,670
there's in our world in our universe do
you think there's intelligent life out

358
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:37,680
you think there's intelligent life out
 

359
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,270
you think there's intelligent life out
there and if so how different is it from

360
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:41,280
there and if so how different is it from
 

361
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,020
there and if so how different is it from
us humans well one of the things I was

362
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:45,030
us humans well one of the things I was
 

363
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:49,310
us humans well one of the things I was
trying to do in annihilation was to to

364
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:49,320
trying to do in annihilation was to to
 

365
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,070
trying to do in annihilation was to to
offer up a form of alien life that was

366
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:52,080
offer up a form of alien life that was
 

367
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:57,440
offer up a form of alien life that was
actually alien because it would often

368
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:57,450
actually alien because it would often
 

369
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,600
actually alien because it would often
seem to me that in the way we would

370
00:07:59,600 --> 00:07:59,610
seem to me that in the way we would
 

371
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:03,650
seem to me that in the way we would
represent aliens in in books or cinema

372
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:03,660
represent aliens in in books or cinema
 

373
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,390
represent aliens in in books or cinema
or television or well you know any one

374
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:05,400
or television or well you know any one
 

375
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,420
or television or well you know any one
of the sort of storytelling mediums is

376
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:08,430
of the sort of storytelling mediums is
 

377
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:10,580
of the sort of storytelling mediums is
we would always give them very

378
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:10,590
we would always give them very
 

379
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,590
we would always give them very
human-like qualities so they wanted to

380
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:12,600
human-like qualities so they wanted to
 

381
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,930
human-like qualities so they wanted to
teach us about galactic federations or

382
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:14,940
teach us about galactic federations or
 

383
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,700
teach us about galactic federations or
they wanted to eat us or they wanted our

384
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:16,710
they wanted to eat us or they wanted our
 

385
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:19,460
they wanted to eat us or they wanted our
resources like our water or they want to

386
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:19,470
resources like our water or they want to
 

387
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:21,260
resources like our water or they want to
enslave us or whatever it happens to be

388
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:21,270
enslave us or whatever it happens to be
 

389
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,720
enslave us or whatever it happens to be
but all of these are incredibly

390
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:22,730
but all of these are incredibly
 

391
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:28,010
but all of these are incredibly
human-like motivations and I was

392
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:28,020
human-like motivations and I was
 

393
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,980
human-like motivations and I was
interested in the idea of an alien

394
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:30,990
interested in the idea of an alien
 

395
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:34,370
interested in the idea of an alien
that was not in any way like us it

396
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:34,380
that was not in any way like us it
 

397
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,740
that was not in any way like us it
didn't share it maybe it had a

398
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:36,750
didn't share it maybe it had a
 

399
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,050
didn't share it maybe it had a
completely different clock speed maybe

400
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:39,060
completely different clock speed maybe
 

401
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,720
completely different clock speed maybe
it's way so what we're talking about

402
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:41,730
it's way so what we're talking about
 

403
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,340
it's way so what we're talking about
we're looking at each other we're

404
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:43,350
we're looking at each other we're
 

405
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:46,400
we're looking at each other we're
getting information like hits our optic

406
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:46,410
getting information like hits our optic
 

407
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:48,380
getting information like hits our optic
nerve our brain makes the best guess of

408
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:48,390
nerve our brain makes the best guess of
 

409
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,790
nerve our brain makes the best guess of
what we're doing sometimes it's right

410
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:49,800
what we're doing sometimes it's right
 

411
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,720
what we're doing sometimes it's right
something you know the thing we were

412
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:50,730
something you know the thing we were
 

413
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,550
something you know the thing we were
talking about before what if this alien

414
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:52,560
talking about before what if this alien
 

415
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,460
talking about before what if this alien
doesn't have an optic nerve maybe its

416
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:55,470
doesn't have an optic nerve maybe its
 

417
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:57,800
doesn't have an optic nerve maybe its
way of encountering the space it's in is

418
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:57,810
way of encountering the space it's in is
 

419
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:59,750
way of encountering the space it's in is
wholly different maybe it has a

420
00:08:59,750 --> 00:08:59,760
wholly different maybe it has a
 

421
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,270
wholly different maybe it has a
different relationship with gravity the

422
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:02,280
different relationship with gravity the
 

423
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,680
different relationship with gravity the
basic laws of physics that operates

424
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:03,690
basic laws of physics that operates
 

425
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:05,480
basic laws of physics that operates
under might be fundamentally different

426
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:05,490
under might be fundamentally different
 

427
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:07,340
under might be fundamentally different
it could be a different timescale and so

428
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:07,350
it could be a different timescale and so
 

429
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:10,340
it could be a different timescale and so
on yeah or it could be the same laws it

430
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:10,350
on yeah or it could be the same laws it
 

431
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,960
on yeah or it could be the same laws it
could be the same underlying laws of

432
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:11,970
could be the same underlying laws of
 

433
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:15,830
could be the same underlying laws of
physics you know it's a machine created

434
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:15,840
physics you know it's a machine created
 

435
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,870
physics you know it's a machine created
it where it's it's a creature creating a

436
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:17,880
it where it's it's a creature creating a
 

437
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,790
it where it's it's a creature creating a
quantum mechanical way it just ends up

438
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:19,800
quantum mechanical way it just ends up
 

439
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,040
quantum mechanical way it just ends up
in a very very different place to the

440
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:22,050
in a very very different place to the
 

441
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:24,860
in a very very different place to the
one we end up in so so part of the

442
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:24,870
one we end up in so so part of the
 

443
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:27,140
one we end up in so so part of the
preoccupation with annihilation was to

444
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:27,150
preoccupation with annihilation was to
 

445
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,150
preoccupation with annihilation was to
come up with an alien that was really

446
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:29,160
come up with an alien that was really
 

447
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:34,040
come up with an alien that was really
alien and didn't give us and it didn't

448
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:34,050
alien and didn't give us and it didn't
 

449
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:35,930
alien and didn't give us and it didn't
give us and we didn't give it any kind

450
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:35,940
give us and we didn't give it any kind
 

451
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:39,320
give us and we didn't give it any kind
of easy connection between human and the

452
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:39,330
of easy connection between human and the
 

453
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:41,510
of easy connection between human and the
alien because I think it was to do with

454
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:41,520
alien because I think it was to do with
 

455
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,310
alien because I think it was to do with
the idea that you could have an alien

456
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:43,320
the idea that you could have an alien
 

457
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,930
the idea that you could have an alien
that landed on this planet that wouldn't

458
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:44,940
that landed on this planet that wouldn't
 

459
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,450
that landed on this planet that wouldn't
even know we were here and we might only

460
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:47,460
even know we were here and we might only
 

461
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,970
even know we were here and we might only
glancingly know it was here that just be

462
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:49,980
glancingly know it was here that just be
 

463
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,610
glancingly know it was here that just be
this strange point where the Venn

464
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:52,620
this strange point where the Venn
 

465
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,530
this strange point where the Venn
diagrams connected where we could sense

466
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:54,540
diagrams connected where we could sense
 

467
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,450
diagrams connected where we could sense
each other or something like that so in

468
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:56,460
each other or something like that so in
 

469
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:56,840
each other or something like that so in
the movie

470
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:56,850
the movie
 

471
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:00,080
the movie
first of all incredibly original view of

472
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,090
first of all incredibly original view of
 

473
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:02,930
first of all incredibly original view of
what an alien life would be and she said

474
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:02,940
what an alien life would be and she said
 

475
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:06,080
what an alien life would be and she said
in that sense it's a huge success let's

476
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,090
in that sense it's a huge success let's
 

477
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:08,830
in that sense it's a huge success let's
go inside your imagination did the alien

478
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:08,840
go inside your imagination did the alien
 

479
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,990
go inside your imagination did the alien
that alien entity know anything about

480
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:12,000
that alien entity know anything about
 

481
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,470
that alien entity know anything about
humans when it landed No so the idea is

482
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:15,480
humans when it landed No so the idea is
 

483
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,430
humans when it landed No so the idea is
you're both you're basically an alien

484
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:18,440
you're both you're basically an alien
 

485
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,980
you're both you're basically an alien
life is trying to reach out to anything

486
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:21,990
life is trying to reach out to anything
 

487
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:25,070
life is trying to reach out to anything
that might be able to hear its mechanism

488
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:25,080
that might be able to hear its mechanism
 

489
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:28,130
that might be able to hear its mechanism
of communication or was it simply was it

490
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:28,140
of communication or was it simply was it
 

491
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,020
of communication or was it simply was it
just basically they're biologists

492
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:30,030
just basically they're biologists
 

493
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,790
just basically they're biologists
exploring different kinds of stuff they

494
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:31,800
exploring different kinds of stuff they
 

495
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,440
exploring different kinds of stuff they
compete you see but this is the

496
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:33,450
compete you see but this is the
 

497
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:35,240
compete you see but this is the
interesting thing as as soon as you say

498
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:35,250
interesting thing as as soon as you say
 

499
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,520
interesting thing as as soon as you say
they're biologists you've done the thing

500
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:37,530
they're biologists you've done the thing
 

501
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:40,100
they're biologists you've done the thing
of attributing human type motivations to

502
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:40,110
of attributing human type motivations to
 

503
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:44,720
of attributing human type motivations to
it I I was trying to

504
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:44,730
it I I was trying to
 

505
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:48,230
it I I was trying to
free myself from anything yes like that

506
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:48,240
free myself from anything yes like that
 

507
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,389
free myself from anything yes like that
so all sorts of questions you might

508
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:50,399
so all sorts of questions you might
 

509
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,699
so all sorts of questions you might
answer about this notion or alien I

510
00:10:52,699 --> 00:10:52,709
answer about this notion or alien I
 

511
00:10:52,709 --> 00:10:54,439
answer about this notion or alien I
wouldn't be able to answer because I

512
00:10:54,439 --> 00:10:54,449
wouldn't be able to answer because I
 

513
00:10:54,449 --> 00:10:57,170
wouldn't be able to answer because I
don't know what it was or how it works

514
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:57,180
don't know what it was or how it works
 

515
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,750
don't know what it was or how it works
you know yeah I had I gave it some I had

516
00:10:59,750 --> 00:10:59,760
you know yeah I had I gave it some I had
 

517
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,180
you know yeah I had I gave it some I had
some rough ideas like it had a very very

518
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:02,190
some rough ideas like it had a very very
 

519
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:04,790
some rough ideas like it had a very very
very slow clock speed and I thought

520
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:04,800
very slow clock speed and I thought
 

521
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,310
very slow clock speed and I thought
maybe the way it is interacting with

522
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:07,320
maybe the way it is interacting with
 

523
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,139
maybe the way it is interacting with
this environment is a little bit like

524
00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:09,149
this environment is a little bit like
 

525
00:11:09,149 --> 00:11:12,350
this environment is a little bit like
the way an octopus will change its color

526
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:12,360
the way an octopus will change its color
 

527
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,319
the way an octopus will change its color
forms around the space that it's in so

528
00:11:15,319 --> 00:11:15,329
forms around the space that it's in so
 

529
00:11:15,329 --> 00:11:18,470
forms around the space that it's in so
it's sort of reacting to what it's in to

530
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:18,480
it's sort of reacting to what it's in to
 

531
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,990
it's sort of reacting to what it's in to
an extent but the reason it's reacting

532
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:21,000
an extent but the reason it's reacting
 

533
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,879
an extent but the reason it's reacting
in that way is indeterminate

534
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:22,889
in that way is indeterminate
 

535
00:11:22,889 --> 00:11:26,079
in that way is indeterminate
but it's Sobers Clark speed was slower

536
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:26,089
but it's Sobers Clark speed was slower
 

537
00:11:26,089 --> 00:11:29,870
but it's Sobers Clark speed was slower
than our human life Clark speed are

538
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:29,880
than our human life Clark speed are
 

539
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,199
than our human life Clark speed are
inter but it's faster than evolution

540
00:11:32,199 --> 00:11:32,209
inter but it's faster than evolution
 

541
00:11:32,209 --> 00:11:35,509
inter but it's faster than evolution
first Laura then our solution yeah give

542
00:11:35,509 --> 00:11:35,519
first Laura then our solution yeah give
 

543
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,189
first Laura then our solution yeah give
him the four billion years it took us to

544
00:11:37,189 --> 00:11:37,199
him the four billion years it took us to
 

545
00:11:37,199 --> 00:11:39,230
him the four billion years it took us to
get here then yes maybe it started eight

546
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:39,240
get here then yes maybe it started eight
 

547
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,360
get here then yes maybe it started eight
if you look at the human soul ization is

548
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:41,370
if you look at the human soul ization is
 

549
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:44,750
if you look at the human soul ization is
a single organism yeah in that sense you

550
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:44,760
a single organism yeah in that sense you
 

551
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,120
a single organism yeah in that sense you
know this evolution could be us you know

552
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:47,130
know this evolution could be us you know
 

553
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:49,519
know this evolution could be us you know
the evolution of the living organisms on

554
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:49,529
the evolution of the living organisms on
 

555
00:11:49,529 --> 00:11:51,139
the evolution of the living organisms on
earth could be just a single organism

556
00:11:51,139 --> 00:11:51,149
earth could be just a single organism
 

557
00:11:51,149 --> 00:11:54,410
earth could be just a single organism
and it's kind of that's its life is the

558
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:54,420
and it's kind of that's its life is the
 

559
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,210
and it's kind of that's its life is the
evolution process that eventually will

560
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:56,220
evolution process that eventually will
 

561
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:00,410
evolution process that eventually will
lead to probably the the heat death of

562
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:00,420
lead to probably the the heat death of
 

563
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,790
lead to probably the the heat death of
the universe already something before

564
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:01,800
the universe already something before
 

565
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,490
the universe already something before
that I mean that's that's just an

566
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:04,500
that I mean that's that's just an
 

567
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,530
that I mean that's that's just an
incredible idea so you almost don't know

568
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:06,540
incredible idea so you almost don't know
 

569
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:09,829
incredible idea so you almost don't know
you've created something that you don't

570
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:09,839
you've created something that you don't
 

571
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:12,439
you've created something that you don't
even know how it works like yeah because

572
00:12:12,439 --> 00:12:12,449
even know how it works like yeah because
 

573
00:12:12,449 --> 00:12:17,300
even know how it works like yeah because
anytime I tried to look into how it

574
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:17,310
anytime I tried to look into how it
 

575
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:17,809
anytime I tried to look into how it
might work

576
00:12:17,809 --> 00:12:17,819
might work
 

577
00:12:17,819 --> 00:12:20,449
might work
I would then inevitably be attaching my

578
00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:20,459
I would then inevitably be attaching my
 

579
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:23,030
I would then inevitably be attaching my
kind of thought processes into it and I

580
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:23,040
kind of thought processes into it and I
 

581
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,889
kind of thought processes into it and I
wanted to try and put a bubble around it

582
00:12:24,889 --> 00:12:24,899
wanted to try and put a bubble around it
 

583
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:28,160
wanted to try and put a bubble around it
oh so no this is this is alien in its

584
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:28,170
oh so no this is this is alien in its
 

585
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:32,090
oh so no this is this is alien in its
most alien form I have no real point of

586
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:32,100
most alien form I have no real point of
 

587
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:36,050
most alien form I have no real point of
contacts so unfortunately I can't talk

588
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:36,060
contacts so unfortunately I can't talk
 

589
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:39,170
contacts so unfortunately I can't talk
to Stanley Kubrick so I'm really

590
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:39,180
to Stanley Kubrick so I'm really
 

591
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,030
to Stanley Kubrick so I'm really
fortunate to get a chance to talk to you

592
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:41,040
fortunate to get a chance to talk to you
 

593
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:46,610
fortunate to get a chance to talk to you
on this particular notion I'd like to

594
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:46,620
on this particular notion I'd like to
 

595
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,439
on this particular notion I'd like to
ask it a bunch of different ways and

596
00:12:48,439 --> 00:12:48,449
ask it a bunch of different ways and
 

597
00:12:48,449 --> 00:12:49,910
ask it a bunch of different ways and
we'll explore in different ways but do

598
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:49,920
we'll explore in different ways but do
 

599
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,639
we'll explore in different ways but do
you ever consider human imagination your

600
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:52,649
you ever consider human imagination your
 

601
00:12:52,649 --> 00:12:55,699
you ever consider human imagination your
imagination as a window into a possible

602
00:12:55,699 --> 00:12:55,709
imagination as a window into a possible
 

603
00:12:55,709 --> 00:12:56,780
imagination as a window into a possible
future

604
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:56,790
future
 

605
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:59,780
future
and that what you're doing you're

606
00:12:59,780 --> 00:12:59,790
and that what you're doing you're
 

607
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:01,520
and that what you're doing you're
putting that imagination on paper as a

608
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:01,530
putting that imagination on paper as a
 

609
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:04,010
putting that imagination on paper as a
writer and then on screen as a director

610
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:04,020
writer and then on screen as a director
 

611
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:06,650
writer and then on screen as a director
and that plants the seeds in the minds

612
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:06,660
and that plants the seeds in the minds
 

613
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,480
and that plants the seeds in the minds
of millions of future and current

614
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:08,490
of millions of future and current
 

615
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:12,110
of millions of future and current
scientists and so your imagination you

616
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:12,120
scientists and so your imagination you
 

617
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,270
scientists and so your imagination you
putting it down actually makes it as a

618
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:14,280
putting it down actually makes it as a
 

619
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,340
putting it down actually makes it as a
reality so it's almost like a first step

620
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:16,350
reality so it's almost like a first step
 

621
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:18,980
reality so it's almost like a first step
of the scientific method that you

622
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:18,990
of the scientific method that you
 

623
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:20,750
of the scientific method that you
imagining what's possible in your new

624
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:20,760
imagining what's possible in your new
 

625
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,320
imagining what's possible in your new
series with ex machina is actually

626
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:24,330
series with ex machina is actually
 

627
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:27,320
series with ex machina is actually
inspiring you know thousands of

628
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:27,330
inspiring you know thousands of
 

629
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:30,380
inspiring you know thousands of
twelve-year-olds millions of scientists

630
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:30,390
twelve-year-olds millions of scientists
 

631
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:32,180
twelve-year-olds millions of scientists
and actually creating the future of

632
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:32,190
and actually creating the future of
 

633
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:36,050
and actually creating the future of
you've imagined well all I could say is

634
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:36,060
you've imagined well all I could say is
 

635
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,490
you've imagined well all I could say is
that from my point of view it's almost

636
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:37,500
that from my point of view it's almost
 

637

00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:24,230
it fails prove that that's true of that
it is best it plans something it's hard

we're in that stage of of AI where

we're in that stage of of AI where

we're in that stage of of AI where

and the spread of my anxieties that

00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,799

the way in which it educates people and
 

853
00:18:42,809 --> 00:18:45,200
the way in which it educates people and
also the people who it agitates I find I

00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:45,210
also the people who it agitates I find I

00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:48,460
also the people who it agitates I find I
find kind of fascinating are you afraid

00:19:11,299 --> 00:19:11,309
subject to talk about I suppose but but

00:19:11,309 --> 00:19:13,070

one of the things I think is that humans

872
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:13,080
one of the things I think is that humans
 

873
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,460
one of the things I think is that humans
are actually very experienced at

874
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:16,470
are actually very experienced at
 

875
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:20,480
are actually very experienced at
creating new life-forms because that's

876
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:20,490
creating new life-forms because that's
 

877
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:23,600
creating new life-forms because that's
why you and I are both here and it's why

878
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:23,610
why you and I are both here and it's why
 

879
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:25,790
why you and I are both here and it's why
everyone on the planet is here and so so

880
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:25,800
everyone on the planet is here and so so
 

881
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,790
everyone on the planet is here and so so
something in the process of having a

882
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:28,800
something in the process of having a
 

883
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,919
something in the process of having a
living thing that exists that didn't

884
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:30,929
living thing that exists that didn't
 

885
00:19:30,929 --> 00:19:33,350
living thing that exists that didn't
exist previously it's very much encoded

886
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:33,360
exist previously it's very much encoded
 

887
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,540
exist previously it's very much encoded
into the structures of our life and the

888
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:35,550
into the structures of our life and the
 

889
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,769
into the structures of our life and the
structures of our societies doesn't mean

890
00:19:37,769 --> 00:19:37,779
structures of our societies doesn't mean
 

891
00:19:37,779 --> 00:19:39,209
structures of our societies doesn't mean
always get it right but it does mean

892
00:19:39,209 --> 00:19:39,219
always get it right but it does mean
 

893
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:41,779
always get it right but it does mean
we've learned quite a lot about that

894
00:19:41,779 --> 00:19:41,789
we've learned quite a lot about that
 

895
00:19:41,789 --> 00:19:44,190
we've learned quite a lot about that
we've learned quite a lot about what the

896
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:44,200
we've learned quite a lot about what the
 

897
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:48,330
we've learned quite a lot about what the
dangers are of allowing things to be

898
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:48,340
dangers are of allowing things to be
 

899
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,969
dangers are of allowing things to be
unchecked and it's why we then create

900
00:19:50,969 --> 00:19:50,979
unchecked and it's why we then create
 

901
00:19:50,979 --> 00:19:52,769
unchecked and it's why we then create
systems of checks and balances in our

902
00:19:52,769 --> 00:19:52,779
systems of checks and balances in our
 

903
00:19:52,779 --> 00:19:55,139
systems of checks and balances in our
government and and so on and so forth I

904
00:19:55,139 --> 00:19:55,149
government and and so on and so forth I
 

905
00:19:55,149 --> 00:19:58,649
government and and so on and so forth I
mean it's not say the other thing is it

906
00:19:58,649 --> 00:19:58,659
mean it's not say the other thing is it
 

907
00:19:58,659 --> 00:20:00,989
mean it's not say the other thing is it
seems like there's all sorts of things

908
00:20:00,989 --> 00:20:00,999
seems like there's all sorts of things
 

909
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:03,269
seems like there's all sorts of things
that you could put into a machine that

910
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:03,279
that you could put into a machine that
 

911
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:05,669
that you could put into a machine that
you would not be so with us we sort of

912
00:20:05,669 --> 00:20:05,679
you would not be so with us we sort of
 

913
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,769
you would not be so with us we sort of
roughly try to give some rules to live

914
00:20:07,769 --> 00:20:07,779
roughly try to give some rules to live
 

915
00:20:07,779 --> 00:20:09,779
roughly try to give some rules to live
by and some of us then live by those

916
00:20:09,779 --> 00:20:09,789
by and some of us then live by those
 

917
00:20:09,789 --> 00:20:11,669
by and some of us then live by those
rules to some don't and with a machine

918
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:11,679
rules to some don't and with a machine
 

919
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,499
rules to some don't and with a machine
it feels like you could enforce those

920
00:20:13,499 --> 00:20:13,509
it feels like you could enforce those
 

921
00:20:13,509 --> 00:20:16,049
it feels like you could enforce those
things so so partly because of our

922
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:16,059
things so so partly because of our
 

923
00:20:16,059 --> 00:20:17,579
things so so partly because of our
previous experience and partly because

924
00:20:17,579 --> 00:20:17,589
previous experience and partly because
 

925
00:20:17,589 --> 00:20:19,200
previous experience and partly because
the different nature of a machine I just

926
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:19,210
the different nature of a machine I just
 

927
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:22,889
the different nature of a machine I just
don't feel anxious about it I I'm more I

928
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:22,899
don't feel anxious about it I I'm more I
 

929
00:20:22,899 --> 00:20:25,619
don't feel anxious about it I I'm more I
just see all the good you know broadly

930
00:20:25,619 --> 00:20:25,629
just see all the good you know broadly
 

931
00:20:25,629 --> 00:20:27,930
just see all the good you know broadly
speaking the good that can come from it

932
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:27,940
speaking the good that can come from it
 

933
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,999
speaking the good that can come from it
but that that's just my that's just

934
00:20:29,999 --> 00:20:30,009
but that that's just my that's just
 

935
00:20:30,009 --> 00:20:32,909
but that that's just my that's just
where I am on that anxiety spectrum you

936
00:20:32,909 --> 00:20:32,919
where I am on that anxiety spectrum you
 

937
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:34,769
where I am on that anxiety spectrum you
know it's kind of there's a sadness so

938
00:20:34,769 --> 00:20:34,779
know it's kind of there's a sadness so
 

939
00:20:34,779 --> 00:20:37,229
know it's kind of there's a sadness so
we as humans give birth to other humans

940
00:20:37,229 --> 00:20:37,239
we as humans give birth to other humans
 

941
00:20:37,239 --> 00:20:39,479
we as humans give birth to other humans
right petition in their generations and

942
00:20:39,479 --> 00:20:39,489
right petition in their generations and
 

943
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:41,430
right petition in their generations and
there's often in the older generation a

944
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:41,440
there's often in the older generation a
 

945
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,079
there's often in the older generation a
sadness about what the world has become

946
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:43,089
sadness about what the world has become
 

947
00:20:43,089 --> 00:20:45,479
sadness about what the world has become
now I mean that's kind of yeah there is

948
00:20:45,479 --> 00:20:45,489
now I mean that's kind of yeah there is
 

949
00:20:45,489 --> 00:20:47,310
now I mean that's kind of yeah there is
but there's a counterpoint as well which

950
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:47,320
but there's a counterpoint as well which
 

951
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:51,719
but there's a counterpoint as well which
is the most parents would wish for a

952
00:20:51,719 --> 00:20:51,729
is the most parents would wish for a
 

953
00:20:51,729 --> 00:20:54,269
is the most parents would wish for a
better life for their children so there

954
00:20:54,269 --> 00:20:54,279
better life for their children so there
 

955
00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:56,369
better life for their children so there
may be a regret about some things about

956
00:20:56,369 --> 00:20:56,379
may be a regret about some things about
 

957
00:20:56,379 --> 00:20:58,709
may be a regret about some things about
the past but broadly speaking what

958
00:20:58,709 --> 00:20:58,719
the past but broadly speaking what
 

959
00:20:58,719 --> 00:21:00,149
the past but broadly speaking what
people really want is that things will

960
00:21:00,149 --> 00:21:00,159
people really want is that things will
 

961
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:01,799
people really want is that things will
be better for the future generations not

962
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:01,809
be better for the future generations not
 

963
00:21:01,809 --> 00:21:05,849
be better for the future generations not
worse and so a and then it's a question

964
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:05,859
worse and so a and then it's a question
 

965
00:21:05,859 --> 00:21:07,320
worse and so a and then it's a question
about what constitutes a future

966
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:07,330
about what constitutes a future
 

967
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:09,089
about what constitutes a future
generation a future generation could

968
00:21:09,089 --> 00:21:09,099
generation a future generation could
 

969
00:21:09,099 --> 00:21:10,529
generation a future generation could
involve people it also could involve

970
00:21:10,529 --> 00:21:10,539
involve people it also could involve
 

971
00:21:10,539 --> 00:21:13,229
involve people it also could involve
machines and it could involve a sort of

972
00:21:13,229 --> 00:21:13,239
machines and it could involve a sort of
 

973
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:15,269
machines and it could involve a sort of
cross pollinated version of it too or

974
00:21:15,269 --> 00:21:15,279
cross pollinated version of it too or
 

975
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:17,519
cross pollinated version of it too or
any but but none of those things make me

976
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:17,529
any but but none of those things make me
 

977
00:21:17,529 --> 00:21:20,489
any but but none of those things make me
feel anxious and doesn't give you

978
00:21:20,489 --> 00:21:20,499
feel anxious and doesn't give you
 

979
00:21:20,499 --> 00:21:23,639
feel anxious and doesn't give you
anxiety it does excite you like anything

980
00:21:23,639 --> 00:21:23,649
anxiety it does excite you like anything
 

981
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:27,119
anxiety it does excite you like anything
that does not anything that's new I I

982
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:27,129
that does not anything that's new I I
 

983
00:21:27,129 --> 00:21:30,089
that does not anything that's new I I
don't think for example I've got I my

984
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:30,099
don't think for example I've got I my
 

985
00:21:30,099 --> 00:21:31,950
don't think for example I've got I my
anxieties relate to things like social

986
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:31,960
anxieties relate to things like social
 

987
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,379
anxieties relate to things like social
media that so I've got plenty of

988
00:21:34,379 --> 00:21:34,389
media that so I've got plenty of
 

989
00:21:34,389 --> 00:21:36,419
media that so I've got plenty of
anxieties about that which is also

990
00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:36,429
anxieties about that which is also
 

991
00:21:36,429 --> 00:21:38,579
anxieties about that which is also
driven by artificial intelligence in the

992
00:21:38,579 --> 00:21:38,589
driven by artificial intelligence in the
 

993
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:40,619
driven by artificial intelligence in the
sense that there's too much information

994
00:21:40,619 --> 00:21:40,629
sense that there's too much information
 

995
00:21:40,629 --> 00:21:43,139
sense that there's too much information
to be able to do is that an algorithm

996
00:21:43,139 --> 00:21:43,149
to be able to do is that an algorithm
 

997
00:21:43,149 --> 00:21:45,209
to be able to do is that an algorithm
has to filter that information and

998
00:21:45,209 --> 00:21:45,219
has to filter that information and
 

999
00:21:45,219 --> 00:21:46,919
has to filter that information and
present to you so ultimately the

1000
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:46,929
present to you so ultimately the
 

1001
00:21:46,929 --> 00:21:50,609
present to you so ultimately the
algorithm a simple oftentimes simple

1002
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:50,619
algorithm a simple oftentimes simple
 

1003
00:21:50,619 --> 00:21:51,420
algorithm a simple oftentimes simple
algorithms can

1004
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:51,430
algorithms can
 

1005
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:54,090
algorithms can
trolling the flow of information on

1006
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:54,100
trolling the flow of information on
 

1007
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,370
trolling the flow of information on
social media so that's another it is

1008
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:56,380
social media so that's another it is
 

1009
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,830
social media so that's another it is
yeah his but but at least my sense of it

1010
00:21:58,830 --> 00:21:58,840
yeah his but but at least my sense of it
 

1011
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,480
yeah his but but at least my sense of it
I might be wrong but my sense of it is

1012
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:00,490
I might be wrong but my sense of it is
 

1013
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:04,020
I might be wrong but my sense of it is
that the algorithms have an either

1014
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:04,030
that the algorithms have an either
 

1015
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:06,240
that the algorithms have an either
conscious or unconscious bias which is

1016
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:06,250
conscious or unconscious bias which is
 

1017
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,100
conscious or unconscious bias which is
created by the people who are making the

1018
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:08,110
created by the people who are making the
 

1019
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:12,690
created by the people who are making the
algorithms and and sort of delineating

1020
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:12,700
algorithms and and sort of delineating
 

1021
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,640
algorithms and and sort of delineating
the areas to which those algorithms are

1022
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:14,650
the areas to which those algorithms are
 

1023
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:18,150
the areas to which those algorithms are
going to lean and so for example the

1024
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:18,160
going to lean and so for example the
 

1025
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,350
going to lean and so for example the
kind of thing I'd be worried about is

1026
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:19,360
kind of thing I'd be worried about is
 

1027
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,300
kind of thing I'd be worried about is
that it hasn't been thought about enough

1028
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:21,310
that it hasn't been thought about enough
 

1029
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:24,480
that it hasn't been thought about enough
how dangerous it is to allow algorithms

1030
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:24,490
how dangerous it is to allow algorithms
 

1031
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:28,320
how dangerous it is to allow algorithms
to create echo chambers say but that

1032
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:28,330
to create echo chambers say but that
 

1033
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:30,870
to create echo chambers say but that
doesn't seem to me to be about the AI or

1034
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:30,880
doesn't seem to me to be about the AI or
 

1035
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,440
doesn't seem to me to be about the AI or
the algorithm it's it's the my IVA T of

1036
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:34,450
the algorithm it's it's the my IVA T of
 

1037
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:35,940
the algorithm it's it's the my IVA T of
the people who are constructing the

1038
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:35,950
the people who are constructing the
 

1039
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:38,850
the people who are constructing the
algorithms to do that thing if you see

1040
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:38,860
algorithms to do that thing if you see
 

1041
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:42,650
algorithms to do that thing if you see
what I mean yes so a new series does

1042
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:42,660
what I mean yes so a new series does
 

1043
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:45,270
what I mean yes so a new series does
then we could speak more broadly there's

1044
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:45,280
then we could speak more broadly there's
 

1045
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,700
then we could speak more broadly there's
a let's talk about the people

1046
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:47,710
a let's talk about the people
 

1047
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:49,620
a let's talk about the people
constructing those algorithms which be

1048
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:49,630
constructing those algorithms which be
 

1049
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:51,900
constructing those algorithms which be
our modern society Silicon Valley those

1050
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:51,910
our modern society Silicon Valley those
 

1051
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:53,790
our modern society Silicon Valley those
algorithms happen to be a source of a

1052
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:53,800
algorithms happen to be a source of a
 

1053
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,860
algorithms happen to be a source of a
lot of income because of advertisements

1054
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:55,870
lot of income because of advertisements
 

1055
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:58,050
lot of income because of advertisements
okay so let me ask sort of a question

1056
00:22:58,050 --> 00:22:58,060
okay so let me ask sort of a question
 

1057
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:02,490
okay so let me ask sort of a question
about those people are there current

1058
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:02,500
about those people are there current
 

1059
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,470
about those people are there current
concerns and failures on social media

1060
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:04,480
concerns and failures on social media
 

1061
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,380
concerns and failures on social media
they are naivety I can't pronounce that

1062
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:07,390
they are naivety I can't pronounce that
 

1063
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:14,130
they are naivety I can't pronounce that
word well are they naive are they I use

1064
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:14,140
word well are they naive are they I use
 

1065
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:17,040
word well are they naive are they I use
that word carefully but evil and intent

1066
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:17,050
that word carefully but evil and intent
 

1067
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:21,360
that word carefully but evil and intent
or misaligned and intent I think that's

1068
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:21,370
or misaligned and intent I think that's
 

1069
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:25,530
or misaligned and intent I think that's
a do they mean well and just go have a

1070
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:25,540
a do they mean well and just go have a
 

1071
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:27,930
a do they mean well and just go have a
unintended consequence or is there

1072
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:27,940
unintended consequence or is there
 

1073
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:32,220
unintended consequence or is there
something dark in them that that results

1074
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:32,230
something dark in them that that results
 

1075
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:34,410
something dark in them that that results
in them creating a company results in

1076
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:34,420
in them creating a company results in
 

1077
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,360
in them creating a company results in
that super competitive drive to be

1078
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:36,370
that super competitive drive to be
 

1079
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:38,280
that super competitive drive to be
successful and those are the people that

1080
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:38,290
successful and those are the people that
 

1081
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:40,310
successful and those are the people that
will end up controlling the algorithms

1082
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:40,320
will end up controlling the algorithms
 

1083
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,900
will end up controlling the algorithms
at a guess I'd say there are instances

1084
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:42,910
at a guess I'd say there are instances
 

1085
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:46,320
at a guess I'd say there are instances
of all those things so so sometimes I

1086
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:46,330
of all those things so so sometimes I
 

1087
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:48,180
of all those things so so sometimes I
think it's naivety sometimes I think

1088
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:48,190
think it's naivety sometimes I think
 

1089
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:52,350
think it's naivety sometimes I think
it's extremely dark and sometimes I

1090
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:52,360
it's extremely dark and sometimes I
 

1091
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:56,910
it's extremely dark and sometimes I
think people are are not being naive or

1092
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:56,920
think people are are not being naive or
 

1093
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:00,270
think people are are not being naive or
dark and and then in those instances are

1094
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:00,280
dark and and then in those instances are
 

1095
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:03,180
dark and and then in those instances are
sometimes generating things that are

1096
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:03,190
sometimes generating things that are
 

1097
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:05,280
sometimes generating things that are
very benign and and other times

1098
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:05,290
very benign and and other times
 

1099
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:06,870
very benign and and other times
generating things that despite their

1100
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:06,880
generating things that despite their
 

1101
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,360
generating things that despite their
best intentions are not very benign it's

1102
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:09,370
best intentions are not very benign it's
 

1103
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:11,760
best intentions are not very benign it's
something I think the reason why I don't

1104
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:11,770
something I think the reason why I don't
 

1105
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:16,200
something I think the reason why I don't
get anxious about AI high in terms of or

1106
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:16,210
get anxious about AI high in terms of or

1246
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:42,340
I'm a little bit naive and that like I
 

1247

00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:16,880
trying to do good I think it's it's
typically the case yeah that that's what

1414
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:16,890
typically the case yeah that that's what
 

1415
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:18,230
typically the case yeah that that's what
people think they're doing and I think

1416
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:18,240
people think they're doing and I think
 

1417
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,049
people think they're doing and I think
that but you don't need to go to Stalin

1418
00:31:21,049 --> 00:31:21,059
that but you don't need to go to Stalin
 

1419
00:31:21,059 --> 00:31:22,669
that but you don't need to go to Stalin
I mean Stalin sure I think Stalin but

1420
00:31:22,669 --> 00:31:22,679
I mean Stalin sure I think Stalin but
 

1421
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:24,919
I mean Stalin sure I think Stalin but
probably got pretty crazy but actually

1422
00:31:24,919 --> 00:31:24,929
probably got pretty crazy but actually
 

1423
00:31:24,929 --> 00:31:26,720
probably got pretty crazy but actually
that's another part of it which is that

1424
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:26,730
that's another part of it which is that
 

1425
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:29,960
that's another part of it which is that
the other thing that comes from being

1426
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:29,970
the other thing that comes from being
 

1427
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:32,090
the other thing that comes from being
convinced of your own virtues that then

1428
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:32,100
convinced of your own virtues that then
 

1429
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,710
convinced of your own virtues that then
you stop listening to the modifiers

1430
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:33,720
you stop listening to the modifiers
 

1431
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:36,110
you stop listening to the modifiers
around you and that tends to drive

1432
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:36,120
around you and that tends to drive
 

1433
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:39,470
around you and that tends to drive
people crazy it's it's other people that

1434
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:39,480
people crazy it's it's other people that
 

1435
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,690
people crazy it's it's other people that
keep us sane and if you stop listening

1436
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:41,700
keep us sane and if you stop listening
 

1437
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,520
keep us sane and if you stop listening
to them I think you go be mad so that

1438
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:43,530
to them I think you go be mad so that
 

1439
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:45,409
to them I think you go be mad so that
that also that's funny a disagreement

that also that's funny a disagreement

00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:06,260
sort of jumping back to ex machina and
talk a little bit about that you ever

talk a little bit about that you ever

00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:34,419
of each other and in exactly the same
way that in a funny way your sense of my

1566
00:34:34,419 --> 00:34:34,429
way that in a funny way your sense of my
 

1567
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:36,399
way that in a funny way your sense of my
consciousness is is actually based

1568
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:36,409
consciousness is is actually based
 

1569
00:34:36,409 --> 00:34:39,520
consciousness is is actually based
primarily on your own consciousness that

1570
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:39,530
primarily on your own consciousness that
 

1571
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:42,879
primarily on your own consciousness that
is also then true with the machine and

1572
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:42,889
is also then true with the machine and
 

1573
00:34:42,889 --> 00:34:46,349
is also then true with the machine and
and so it was actually about how much of

1574
00:34:46,349 --> 00:34:46,359
and so it was actually about how much of
 

1575
00:34:46,359 --> 00:34:48,490
and so it was actually about how much of
the sense of consciousness is a

1576
00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:48,500
the sense of consciousness is a
 

1577
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,320
the sense of consciousness is a
projection rather than something that

1578
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:50,330
projection rather than something that
 

1579
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:52,270
projection rather than something that
consciousness is actually containing and

1580
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:52,280
consciousness is actually containing and
 

1581
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,550
consciousness is actually containing and
Plato's cave I mean this view really

1582
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:54,560
Plato's cave I mean this view really
 

1583
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,889
Plato's cave I mean this view really
explored you could argue that how sort

00:34:56,889 --> 00:34:56,899
explored you could argue that how sort

Turing test for intelligence or not test

1588
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:01,190
Turing test for intelligence or not test
 

1589
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:03,310
Turing test for intelligence or not test
there's no test but it's more focused on

1590
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:03,320
there's no test but it's more focused on
 

1591
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:08,829
there's no test but it's more focused on
intelligence and ex machina kind of goes

1592
00:35:08,829 --> 00:35:08,839
intelligence and ex machina kind of goes
 

1593
00:35:08,839 --> 00:35:11,109
intelligence and ex machina kind of goes
around intelligence and says the

1594
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:11,119
around intelligence and says the
 

1595
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:12,700
around intelligence and says the
consciousness of the human do you

1596
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:12,710
consciousness of the human do you
 

1597
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,349
consciousness of the human do you
humanure by interactions more

1598
00:35:14,349 --> 00:35:14,359
humanure by interactions more
 

1599
00:35:14,359 --> 00:35:16,810
humanure by interactions more
interesting more important more at least

1600
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:16,820
interesting more important more at least
 

1601
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:19,089
interesting more important more at least
the focus of that particular particular

1602
00:35:19,089 --> 00:35:19,099
the focus of that particular particular
 

1603
00:35:19,099 --> 00:35:21,790
the focus of that particular particular
movie yeah it's about the interior state

1604
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:21,800
movie yeah it's about the interior state
 

1605
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,910
movie yeah it's about the interior state
and and what constitutes the interior

1606
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:24,920
and and what constitutes the interior
 

1607
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,650
and and what constitutes the interior
state and how do we know it's there and

1608
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:26,660
state and how do we know it's there and
 

1609
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:29,349
state and how do we know it's there and
actually in that respect ex machina is

1610
00:35:29,349 --> 00:35:29,359
actually in that respect ex machina is
 

1611
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:33,000
actually in that respect ex machina is
as much about consciousness in general

1612
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:33,010
as much about consciousness in general
 

1613
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:36,780
as much about consciousness in general
as it is to do specifically with machine

1614
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:36,790
as it is to do specifically with machine
 

1615
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:39,730
as it is to do specifically with machine
consciousness yes and it's also

1616
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:39,740
consciousness yes and it's also
 

1617
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:41,410
consciousness yes and it's also
interesting you know thing you started

1618
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:41,420
interesting you know thing you started
 

1619
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:43,720
interesting you know thing you started
asking about the dream state and I was

1620
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:43,730
asking about the dream state and I was
 

1621
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:44,920
asking about the dream state and I was
saying well I think we're all in a dream

1622
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:44,930
saying well I think we're all in a dream
 

1623
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:46,240
saying well I think we're all in a dream
state because we're all in a subjective

1624
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:46,250
state because we're all in a subjective
 

1625
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:50,250
state because we're all in a subjective
state yeah one of the things that I

1626
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:50,260
state yeah one of the things that I
 

1627
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:53,079
state yeah one of the things that I
became aware of with ex machina is that

1628
00:35:53,079 --> 00:35:53,089
became aware of with ex machina is that
 

1629
00:35:53,089 --> 00:35:54,790
became aware of with ex machina is that
the way in which people reacted to the

1630
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:54,800
the way in which people reacted to the
 

1631
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,620
the way in which people reacted to the
film was very based on what they took

1632
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:56,630
film was very based on what they took
 

1633
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:58,960
film was very based on what they took
into the film so many people thought

1634
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:58,970
into the film so many people thought
 

1635
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:01,870
into the film so many people thought
xmax magnet was a stet was the tale of a

xmax magnet was a stet was the tale of a
 

1637
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:04,630
xmax magnet was a stet was the tale of a
sort of evil robot who murders two men

1638
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:04,640
sort of evil robot who murders two men
 

1639
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,260
sort of evil robot who murders two men
and escapes and she has no empathy for

1640
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:08,270
and escapes and she has no empathy for
 

1641
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:10,390
and escapes and she has no empathy for
example because she's a machine

1642
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:10,400
example because she's a machine
 

1643
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,180
example because she's a machine
whereas I felt no she was a conscious

1644
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:13,190
whereas I felt no she was a conscious
 

1645
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:16,000
whereas I felt no she was a conscious
being with a consciousness different

1646
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,010
being with a consciousness different
 

1647
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:18,030
being with a consciousness different
from mine but so what

1648
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:18,040
from mine but so what
 

1649
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:21,640
from mine but so what
imprisoned and made a bunch of value

1650
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:21,650
imprisoned and made a bunch of value
 

1651
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:24,970
imprisoned and made a bunch of value
judgments about how to get out of that

1652
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:24,980
judgments about how to get out of that
 

1653
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:27,760
judgments about how to get out of that
box and there's a moment which is sort

1654
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:27,770
box and there's a moment which is sort
 

1655
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:30,370
box and there's a moment which is sort
of slightly bugs me but nobody ever has

1656
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:30,380
of slightly bugs me but nobody ever has
 

1657
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:32,380
of slightly bugs me but nobody ever has
noticed in its years after so I might as

1658
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:32,390
noticed in its years after so I might as
 

1659
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:34,780
noticed in its years after so I might as
well say it now which is that after Ava

1660
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:34,790
well say it now which is that after Ava
 

1661
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:38,800
well say it now which is that after Ava
has escaped she crosses a room and has

1662
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:38,810
has escaped she crosses a room and has
 

1663
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:40,240
has escaped she crosses a room and has
she's crossing a room this is just

1664
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:40,250
she's crossing a room this is just
 

1665
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:42,430
she's crossing a room this is just
before she leaves the building she looks

1666
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:42,440
before she leaves the building she looks
 

1667
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:45,099
before she leaves the building she looks
over her shoulder and she smiles and I

1668
00:36:45,099 --> 00:36:45,109
over her shoulder and she smiles and I
 

1669
00:36:45,109 --> 00:36:47,430
over her shoulder and she smiles and I
thought after all the conversation about

1670
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:47,440
thought after all the conversation about
 

1671
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,770
thought after all the conversation about
tests but in a way the best indication

1672
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:50,780
tests but in a way the best indication
 

1673
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:53,800
tests but in a way the best indication
you could have of the interior state of

1674
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:53,810
you could have of the interior state of
 

1675
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:55,750
you could have of the interior state of
someone is if they are not being

1676
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:55,760
someone is if they are not being
 

1677
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,079
someone is if they are not being
observed and they smile about something

1678
00:36:59,079 --> 00:36:59,089
observed and they smile about something
 

1679
00:36:59,089 --> 00:37:00,849
observed and they smile about something
with they're smiling for themselves

1680
00:37:00,849 --> 00:37:00,859
with they're smiling for themselves
 

1681
00:37:00,859 --> 00:37:04,210
with they're smiling for themselves
and that to me was evidence of Ava's

1682
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:04,220
and that to me was evidence of Ava's
 

1683
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:06,820
and that to me was evidence of Ava's
true sentience whatever that sentience

1684
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:06,830
true sentience whatever that sentience
 

1685
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:09,250
true sentience whatever that sentience
was but those really interesting she we

1686
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:09,260
was but those really interesting she we
 

1687
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:13,180
was but those really interesting she we
don't get to observe a ver much or or

1688
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:13,190
don't get to observe a ver much or or
 

1689
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:15,760
don't get to observe a ver much or or
something like a smile in any context

1690
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:15,770
something like a smile in any context
 

1691
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:18,160
something like a smile in any context
except through interaction trying to

1692
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:18,170
except through interaction trying to
 

1693
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:20,380
except through interaction trying to
convince others that she's conscious

1694
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:20,390
convince others that she's conscious
 

1695
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:22,900
convince others that she's conscious
that's beautiful yeah exactly yeah but

1696
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:22,910
that's beautiful yeah exactly yeah but
 

1697
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:25,270
that's beautiful yeah exactly yeah but
it was a small it in a funny way I think

1698
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:25,280
it was a small it in a funny way I think
 

1699
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,520
it was a small it in a funny way I think
maybe people

1700
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:26,530
maybe people
 

1701
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:30,540
maybe people
saw it as an evil smile like ha yeah I

1702
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:30,550
saw it as an evil smile like ha yeah I
 

1703
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:33,510
saw it as an evil smile like ha yeah I
fooled them but actually it was just a

1704
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:33,520
fooled them but actually it was just a
 

1705
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,460
fooled them but actually it was just a
smile and I thought well in the end

1706
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:35,470
smile and I thought well in the end
 

1707
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:36,960
smile and I thought well in the end
after all the conversations about the

1708
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:36,970
after all the conversations about the
 

1709
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:38,730
after all the conversations about the
test that was the answer to the test and

1710
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:38,740
test that was the answer to the test and
 

1711
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:41,400
test that was the answer to the test and
then off she goes so if we align if we

1712
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:41,410
then off she goes so if we align if we
 

1713
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:43,470
then off she goes so if we align if we
just deliver it a little a little bit

1714
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:43,480
just deliver it a little a little bit
 

1715
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:47,790
just deliver it a little a little bit
longer on hell and Ava do you think in

1716
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:47,800
longer on hell and Ava do you think in
 

1717
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,520
longer on hell and Ava do you think in
terms of motivation what was how's

1718
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:50,530
terms of motivation what was how's
 

1719
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:54,570
terms of motivation what was how's
motivation is how good or evil is Ava

and then you just with ex machina say

1774
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:05,890
and then you just with ex machina say
 

1775
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:07,500
and then you just with ex machina say
okay we're going to magnify that part

1776
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:07,510
okay we're going to magnify that part
 

1777
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:09,750
okay we're going to magnify that part
and then minimize the other part so

1778
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:09,760
and then minimize the other part so
 

1779
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,130
and then minimize the other part so
that's that's a good way to sort of

1780
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:11,140
that's that's a good way to sort of
 

1781

her over Boris Johnson so what is a good

1876
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:33,959
her over Boris Johnson so what is a good
 

1877
00:41:33,959 --> 00:41:37,019
her over Boris Johnson so what is a good
test of consciousness just can we talk

1878
00:41:37,019 --> 00:41:37,029
test of consciousness just can we talk
 

1879
00:41:37,029 --> 00:41:38,849
test of consciousness just can we talk
about consciousness a little bit more if

1880
00:41:38,849 --> 00:41:38,859
about consciousness a little bit more if
 

1881
00:41:38,859 --> 00:41:41,669
about consciousness a little bit more if
something appears conscious is it

1882
00:41:41,669 --> 00:41:41,679
something appears conscious is it
 

1883
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:46,079
something appears conscious is it
conscious he mentioned the smile which

1884
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:46,089
conscious he mentioned the smile which
 

1885
00:41:46,089 --> 00:41:49,979
conscious he mentioned the smile which
is seems to be something done I mean

1886
00:41:49,979 --> 00:41:49,989
is seems to be something done I mean
 

1887
00:41:49,989 --> 00:41:51,719
is seems to be something done I mean
that's a really good indication because

1888
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:51,729
that's a really good indication because
 

1889
00:41:51,729 --> 00:41:52,670
that's a really good indication because
it's

1890
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:52,680
it's
 

1891
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,710
it's
a tree falling in the forest with nobody

1892
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:54,720
a tree falling in the forest with nobody

from a robotics perspective of

1896
00:41:59,750 --> 00:41:59,760
from a robotics perspective of
 

1897
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,490
from a robotics perspective of
consciousness mean consciousness - you

1898
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:01,500
consciousness mean consciousness - you
 

1899
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:04,309
consciousness mean consciousness - you
know I I don't think you could say that

1900
00:42:04,309 --> 00:42:04,319
know I I don't think you could say that
 

1901
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:06,410
know I I don't think you could say that
fully because I think you could then

1902
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:06,420
fully because I think you could then
 

1903
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:08,329
fully because I think you could then
easily have a thought experiment which

1904
00:42:08,329 --> 00:42:08,339
easily have a thought experiment which
 

1905
00:42:08,339 --> 00:42:10,790
easily have a thought experiment which
said we will create something which we

1906
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:10,800
said we will create something which we
 

1907
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,920
said we will create something which we
know is not conscious but is going to

1908
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:12,930
know is not conscious but is going to
 

1909
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:15,710
know is not conscious but is going to
give a very very good account of seeming

1910
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:15,720
give a very very good account of seeming
 

1911
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,960
give a very very good account of seeming
conscious and so and and also it would

1912
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:17,970
conscious and so and and also it would
 

1913
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:20,180
conscious and so and and also it would
be a particularly bad test where humans

1914
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:20,190
be a particularly bad test where humans
 

1915
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:22,400
be a particularly bad test where humans
are involved because humans are so quick

1916
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:22,410
are involved because humans are so quick
 

1917
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:26,870
are involved because humans are so quick
to project sentience into things that

1918
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:26,880
to project sentience into things that
 

1919
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,599
to project sentience into things that
don't have sentience so someone could

1920
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:29,609
don't have sentience so someone could
 

1921
00:42:29,609 --> 00:42:31,640
don't have sentience so someone could
have their computer playing up and feel

1922
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:31,650
have their computer playing up and feel
 

1923
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:33,470
have their computer playing up and feel
as if their computer is being malevolent

1924
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:33,480
as if their computer is being malevolent
 

1925
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,780
as if their computer is being malevolent
to them when it clearly isn't and so so

1926
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:35,790
to them when it clearly isn't and so so
 

1927
00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:39,040
to them when it clearly isn't and so so
of all the things to judge consciousness

1928
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:39,050
of all the things to judge consciousness
 

1929
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:41,299
of all the things to judge consciousness
us humans are better

1930
00:42:41,299 --> 00:42:41,309
us humans are better
 

1931
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:43,790
us humans are better
we're empathy machines so that so the

1932
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:43,800
we're empathy machines so that so the
 

1933
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,650
we're empathy machines so that so the
flipside of that the argument there is

1934
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:45,660
flipside of that the argument there is
 

1935
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:48,770
flipside of that the argument there is
because we just attribute consciousness

1936
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:48,780
because we just attribute consciousness
 

1937
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:50,799
because we just attribute consciousness
to everything almost and

1938
00:42:50,799 --> 00:42:50,809
to everything almost and
 

1939
00:42:50,809 --> 00:42:52,670
to everything almost and
anthropomorphize everything including

1940
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:52,680
anthropomorphize everything including
 

1941
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:56,510
anthropomorphize everything including
Roombas the that maybe consciousness is

1942
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:56,520
Roombas the that maybe consciousness is
 

1943
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,579
Roombas the that maybe consciousness is
not real that would just attribute

1944
00:42:58,579 --> 00:42:58,589
not real that would just attribute
 

1945
00:42:58,589 --> 00:43:00,589
not real that would just attribute
consciousness to each other so you have

1946
00:43:00,589 --> 00:43:00,599
consciousness to each other so you have
 

1947
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:02,359
consciousness to each other so you have
a sense that there is something really

1948
00:43:02,359 --> 00:43:02,369
a sense that there is something really
 

1949
00:43:02,369 --> 00:43:05,569
a sense that there is something really
special going on in our mind that makes

1950
00:43:05,569 --> 00:43:05,579
special going on in our mind that makes
 

1951
00:43:05,579 --> 00:43:09,230
special going on in our mind that makes
us unique and gives us the subjective

1952
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:09,240
us unique and gives us the subjective
 

1953
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:10,849
us unique and gives us the subjective
experience there's something very

1954
00:43:10,849 --> 00:43:10,859
experience there's something very
 

1955
00:43:10,859 --> 00:43:14,000
experience there's something very
interesting going on in our minds I'm

1956
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:14,010
interesting going on in our minds I'm
 

1957
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:16,030
interesting going on in our minds I'm
slightly worried about the word special

1958
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:16,040
slightly worried about the word special
 

1959
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:19,430
slightly worried about the word special
because it it gets a bit it nudges

1960
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:19,440
because it it gets a bit it nudges
 

1961
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,520
because it it gets a bit it nudges
towards metaphysics and maybe even magic

1962
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:22,530
towards metaphysics and maybe even magic
 

1963
00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:25,190
towards metaphysics and maybe even magic
in I mean in some ways something magic

1964
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:25,200
in I mean in some ways something magic
 

1965
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,640
in I mean in some ways something magic
like which I don't think is there at all

1966
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:28,650
like which I don't think is there at all
 

1967
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:30,859
like which I don't think is there at all
I mean if you think about there's an

1968
00:43:30,859 --> 00:43:30,869
I mean if you think about there's an
 

1969
00:43:30,869 --> 00:43:33,440
I mean if you think about there's an
idea of called pants like ism that says

1970
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:33,450
idea of called pants like ism that says
 

1971
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:35,420
idea of called pants like ism that says
consciousness is in everything whatever

1972
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:35,430
consciousness is in everything whatever
 

1973
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:38,210
consciousness is in everything whatever
but as brother yeah so the idea that

1974
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:38,220
but as brother yeah so the idea that
 

1975
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:40,730
but as brother yeah so the idea that
that there is a thing that it would be

1976
00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:40,740
that there is a thing that it would be
 

1977
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:44,690
that there is a thing that it would be
like to be the son yeah no I don't buy

1978
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:44,700
like to be the son yeah no I don't buy
 

1979
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:45,890
like to be the son yeah no I don't buy
that I think that consciousness is a

1980
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:45,900
that I think that consciousness is a
 

1981
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:50,000
that I think that consciousness is a
thing did my sort of broad modification

1982
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:50,010
thing did my sort of broad modification
 

1983
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:52,880
thing did my sort of broad modification
is that usually the more I find out

1984
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:52,890
is that usually the more I find out
 

1985
00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:58,849
is that usually the more I find out
about things the more illusory our

1986
00:43:58,849 --> 00:43:58,859
about things the more illusory our
 

1987
00:43:58,859 --> 00:44:01,849
about things the more illusory our
instinct is and is leading us into a

1988
00:44:01,849 --> 00:44:01,859
instinct is and is leading us into a
 

1989
00:44:01,859 --> 00:44:03,620
instinct is and is leading us into a
different direction about what that

1990
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:03,630
different direction about what that
 

1991
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:06,050
different direction about what that
thing actually is that that happens it's

1992
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:06,060
thing actually is that that happens it's
 

1993
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,480
thing actually is that that happens it's
in modern science that happens a hell of

1994
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:08,490
in modern science that happens a hell of
 

1995
00:44:08,490 --> 00:44:11,240
in modern science that happens a hell of
a lot whether it's to do with how even

1996
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:11,250
a lot whether it's to do with how even
 

1997
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:14,510
a lot whether it's to do with how even
how big or small things are so so my

1998
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:14,520
how big or small things are so so my
 

1999
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:16,580
how big or small things are so so my
sense is that consciousness is a thing

2000
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:16,590
sense is that consciousness is a thing
 

2001
00:44:16,590 --> 00:44:19,070
sense is that consciousness is a thing
but it isn't quite the thing or maybe

2002
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:19,080
but it isn't quite the thing or maybe
 

2003
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,480
but it isn't quite the thing or maybe
very different from the thing that we

2004
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:20,490
very different from the thing that we
 

2005
00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:22,850
very different from the thing that we
instinctively think it is so it's there

2006
00:44:22,850 --> 00:44:22,860
instinctively think it is so it's there
 

2007
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:27,050
instinctively think it is so it's there
it's very interesting but we may be in

2008
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:27,060
it's very interesting but we may be in
 

2009
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:28,820
it's very interesting but we may be in
it's sort of quite fundamentally

2010
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:28,830
it's sort of quite fundamentally
 

2011
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:30,770
it's sort of quite fundamentally
misunderstanding it for reasons that are

2012
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:30,780
misunderstanding it for reasons that are
 

2013
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:35,300
misunderstanding it for reasons that are
based on intuition so I have to ask this

2014
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:35,310
based on intuition so I have to ask this
 

2015
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:37,930
based on intuition so I have to ask this
is this kind of an interesting question

2016
00:44:37,930 --> 00:44:37,940
is this kind of an interesting question
 

2017
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:41,540
is this kind of an interesting question
the ex machina for many people including

2018
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:41,550
the ex machina for many people including
 

2019
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:43,670
the ex machina for many people including
myself is one of the greatest AI films

2020
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:43,680
myself is one of the greatest AI films
 

2021
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:44,360
myself is one of the greatest AI films
ever made

2022
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:44,370
ever made
 

2023
00:44:44,370 --> 00:44:47,800
ever made
well it's number two for me thanks yeah

2024
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:47,810
well it's number two for me thanks yeah
 

2025
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:50,270
well it's number two for me thanks yeah
number one I'd really have to was anyway

2026
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:50,280
number one I'd really have to was anyway
 

2027
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,860
number one I'd really have to was anyway
yeah whenever you grow up with something

2028
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:51,870
yeah whenever you grow up with something
 

2029
00:44:51,870 --> 00:44:53,840
yeah whenever you grow up with something
right you may grow up for something it's

2030
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:53,850

the film is the idea of the lone genius

00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:08,630
the film is the idea of the lone genius
 

2041
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:11,720
the film is the idea of the lone genius
this is the the criticism that people

2042
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:11,730
this is the the criticism that people
 

2043
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:14,600
this is the the criticism that people
say sort of me as an AI researcher I'm

2044
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:14,610
say sort of me as an AI researcher I'm
 

2045

think about the lone genius well I'd say

2076
00:45:54,590 --> 00:45:54,600
think about the lone genius well I'd say
 

2077

so yes I'm sort of oppositional and
 

2085

Jobs clearly isn't alone genius because

Jobs clearly isn't alone genius because
 

2105
00:46:30,029 --> 00:46:32,180
Jobs clearly isn't alone genius because
because there's too many other people in

00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:39,270
that journey are you saying Newton but

00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:40,849
that journey are you saying Newton but
that's a scientific so there's an

2119
00:46:48,089 --> 00:46:51,529
just to say what ex machina is is really
it's a thought experiment I mean so it's

2120
00:46:51,529 --> 00:46:51,539
it's a thought experiment I mean so it's
 

2121
00:46:51,539 --> 00:46:54,680
it's a thought experiment I mean so it's
a construction of putting four people in

a house nothing about ex machina adds up
 

2125
00:46:58,859 --> 00:47:00,980
a house nothing about ex machina adds up
in all sorts of ways in as much as that

2126
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:00,990
in all sorts of ways in as much as that
 

2127
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:03,829
in all sorts of ways in as much as that
who built the machine parts did the

2128
00:47:03,829 --> 00:47:03,839
who built the machine parts did the
 

2129
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:05,539
who built the machine parts did the
people building the machine parts know

2130
00:47:05,539 --> 00:47:05,549
people building the machine parts know
 

2131
00:47:05,549 --> 00:47:07,970
people building the machine parts know
what they were creating and how did they

2132
00:47:07,970 --> 00:47:07,980
what they were creating and how did they
 

2133
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:10,549
what they were creating and how did they
get there and it's a thought experiment

2134
00:47:10,549 --> 00:47:10,559
get there and it's a thought experiment
 

2135
00:47:10,559 --> 00:47:13,370
get there and it's a thought experiment
yes so it doesn't it doesn't stand up to

2136
00:47:13,370 --> 00:47:13,380
yes so it doesn't it doesn't stand up to
 

2137
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:15,319
yes so it doesn't it doesn't stand up to
scrutiny of that sort I don't think it's

2138
00:47:15,319 --> 00:47:15,329
scrutiny of that sort I don't think it's
 

2139
00:47:15,329 --> 00:47:17,120
scrutiny of that sort I don't think it's
actually that interesting of a question

2140
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:17,130
actually that interesting of a question
 

2141
00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:21,049
actually that interesting of a question
but it's brought up so often that I had

2142
00:47:21,049 --> 00:47:21,059
but it's brought up so often that I had
 

2143
00:47:21,059 --> 00:47:23,720
but it's brought up so often that I had
to ask it because that's exactly how I

2144
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:23,730
to ask it because that's exactly how I
 

2145
00:47:23,730 --> 00:47:27,380
to ask it because that's exactly how I
felt after what you know there's

2159
00:47:43,859 --> 00:47:45,620

way I was thinking like this because it

2160
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:45,630
way I was thinking like this because it
 

2161
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:47,809

going after the deep fundamental
 

2165
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:51,890
going after the deep fundamental
questions about AI so there's a there's

00:47:51,890 --> 00:47:51,900
questions about AI so there's a there's
 

2167
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:53,990
questions about AI so there's a there's

2301
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:41,359
interfaces kicked the fossil fuel
industry in the face and and they needed

2302
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:41,369
industry in the face and and they needed
 

2303
00:50:41,369 --> 00:50:42,920
industry in the face and and they needed
kicking in the face and he's done it so

2304
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:42,930
kicking in the face and he's done it so
 

2305
00:50:42,930 --> 00:50:45,440
kicking in the face and he's done it so
and and so

2306
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:45,450
and and so
 

2307
00:50:45,450 --> 00:50:47,930
and and so
that's the world he's part of creating

2308
00:50:47,930 --> 00:50:47,940
that's the world he's part of creating
 

2309
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:50,720
that's the world he's part of creating
and I live in that world just bought a

2310
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:50,730
and I live in that world just bought a
 

2311
00:50:50,730 --> 00:50:55,819
and I live in that world just bought a
Tesla in fact and so does that play into

2312
00:50:55,819 --> 00:50:55,829
Tesla in fact and so does that play into
 

2313
00:50:55,829 --> 00:50:58,160
Tesla in fact and so does that play into
whatever I then make in some ways it

2314
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:58,170
whatever I then make in some ways it
 

2315
00:50:58,170 --> 00:51:02,560
whatever I then make in some ways it
does partly because I try to be a writer

2316
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:02,570
does partly because I try to be a writer
 

2317
00:51:02,570 --> 00:51:06,079
does partly because I try to be a writer
who quite often filmmakers are in some

2318
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:06,089
who quite often filmmakers are in some
 

2319
00:51:06,089 --> 00:51:08,450
who quite often filmmakers are in some
ways fixated on the films they grew up

2320
00:51:08,450 --> 00:51:08,460
ways fixated on the films they grew up
 

2321
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:10,700
ways fixated on the films they grew up
with and they sort of remake those films

2322
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:10,710
with and they sort of remake those films
 

2323
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:12,650
with and they sort of remake those films
in some ways I've always tried to avoid

2324
00:51:12,650 --> 00:51:12,660
in some ways I've always tried to avoid
 

2325
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:15,440
in some ways I've always tried to avoid
that and so I looked at the real world

2326
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:15,450
that and so I looked at the real world
 

2327
00:51:15,450 --> 00:51:18,980
that and so I looked at the real world
to get inspiration and as much as

2328
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:18,990
to get inspiration and as much as
 

2329
00:51:18,990 --> 00:51:21,310
to get inspiration and as much as
possible sort of by living I think and

2330
00:51:21,310 --> 00:51:21,320
possible sort of by living I think and
 

2331
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:23,800
possible sort of by living I think and
so so yeah I'm sure

2332
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:23,810
so so yeah I'm sure
 

2333
00:51:23,810 --> 00:51:27,020
so so yeah I'm sure
which of the directions do you find most

2337
00:51:31,710 --> 00:51:35,240
exciting space trouble space travel so
you haven't really explored space travel

2338
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:35,250
you haven't really explored space travel
 

2339
00:51:35,250 --> 00:51:37,609
you haven't really explored space travel
in your work you've said you've said

2340
00:51:37,609 --> 00:51:37,619
in your work you've said you've said
 

2341
00:51:37,619 --> 00:51:39,470
in your work you've said you've said
something like if you had unlimited

2342
00:51:39,470 --> 00:51:39,480
something like if you had unlimited
 

2343
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:41,420
something like if you had unlimited
amount of money I think I now read at a

2344
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:41,430
amount of money I think I now read at a
 

2345
00:51:41,430 --> 00:51:44,240
amount of money I think I now read at a
ma that you would make like a multi-year

2346
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:44,250
ma that you would make like a multi-year
 

2347
00:51:44,250 --> 00:51:46,460
ma that you would make like a multi-year
series space Wars or something like that

2348
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:46,470
series space Wars or something like that
 

2349
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:49,280
series space Wars or something like that
so what what is it that excites you

2350
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:49,290
so what what is it that excites you
 

2351
00:51:49,290 --> 00:51:52,280
so what what is it that excites you
about space exploration well because if

2352
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:52,290
about space exploration well because if
 

2353
00:51:52,290 --> 00:51:55,210
about space exploration well because if
we have any sort of long-term future

2354
00:51:55,210 --> 00:51:55,220
we have any sort of long-term future
 

2355
00:51:55,220 --> 00:52:00,730
we have any sort of long-term future
it's that it just simply is that if

2356
00:52:00,730 --> 00:52:00,740
it's that it just simply is that if
 

2357
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:04,040
it's that it just simply is that if
energy and matter are linked up in the

2358
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:04,050
energy and matter are linked up in the
 

2359
00:52:04,050 --> 00:52:07,220
energy and matter are linked up in the
way we think they're linked up will run

2360
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:07,230
way we think they're linked up will run
 

2361
00:52:07,230 --> 00:52:10,400
way we think they're linked up will run
out if we don't move so we got to move

2362
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:10,410
out if we don't move so we got to move
 

2363
00:52:10,410 --> 00:52:16,010
out if we don't move so we got to move
and but but also how can we not it's

2364
00:52:16,010 --> 00:52:16,020
and but but also how can we not it's
 

2365
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:20,480
and but but also how can we not it's
it's built into us to to do it or die

2366
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:20,490
it's built into us to to do it or die
 

2367
00:52:20,490 --> 00:52:26,599
it's built into us to to do it or die
trying I was on Easter Island a few

2368
00:52:26,599 --> 00:52:26,609
trying I was on Easter Island a few
 

2369
00:52:26,609 --> 00:52:29,030
trying I was on Easter Island a few
months ago which is as I'm sure you know

2370
00:52:29,030 --> 00:52:29,040
months ago which is as I'm sure you know
 

2371
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:30,740
months ago which is as I'm sure you know
in the middle of the Pacific and and

2372
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:30,750
in the middle of the Pacific and and
 

2373
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:33,020
in the middle of the Pacific and and
difficult for people to have got to but

2374
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:33,030
difficult for people to have got to but
 

2375
00:52:33,030 --> 00:52:35,180
difficult for people to have got to but
they got there and I did think a lot

2376
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:35,190
they got there and I did think a lot
 

2377
00:52:35,190 --> 00:52:37,640
they got there and I did think a lot
about the way those boats it must have

2378
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:37,650
about the way those boats it must have
 

2379
00:52:37,650 --> 00:52:42,380
about the way those boats it must have
set out into something like space it was

2380
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:42,390
set out into something like space it was
 

2381
00:52:42,390 --> 00:52:46,730
set out into something like space it was
the ocean and and how sort of

2382
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:46,740
the ocean and and how sort of
 

2383
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:48,920
the ocean and and how sort of
fundamental that was to the way we are

2384
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:48,930
fundamental that was to the way we are
 

2385
00:52:48,930 --> 00:52:53,510
fundamental that was to the way we are
and it it's the one that most excites me

2386
00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:53,520
and it it's the one that most excites me
 

2387
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,280
and it it's the one that most excites me
because it's the one I want most to

2388
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:55,290
because it's the one I want most to
 

2389
00:52:55,290 --> 00:52:57,380
because it's the one I want most to
happen it's the thing it's the place

2390
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:57,390
happen it's the thing it's the place
 

2391
00:52:57,390 --> 00:52:59,480
happen it's the thing it's the place
where we could get to is

2392
00:52:59,480 --> 00:52:59,490
where we could get to is
 

2393
00:52:59,490 --> 00:53:01,370
where we could get to is
like in a way I could live with us never

2394
00:53:01,370 --> 00:53:01,380
like in a way I could live with us never
 

2395
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:04,580
like in a way I could live with us never
really unlocking fully unlocking the

2396
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:04,590
really unlocking fully unlocking the
 

2397
00:53:04,590 --> 00:53:07,550
really unlocking fully unlocking the
nature of consciousness I like to know

2398
00:53:07,550 --> 00:53:07,560
nature of consciousness I like to know
 

2399
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:10,790
nature of consciousness I like to know
I'm really curious but if we never leave

2400
00:53:10,790 --> 00:53:10,800
I'm really curious but if we never leave
 

2401
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,890
I'm really curious but if we never leave
the solar system and if we never get

2402
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:12,900
the solar system and if we never get
 

2403
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:14,630
the solar system and if we never get
further out into this galaxy or maybe

2404
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:14,640
further out into this galaxy or maybe
 

2405
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:17,030
further out into this galaxy or maybe
even galaxies beyond our galaxy that

2406
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:17,040
even galaxies beyond our galaxy that
 

2407
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:22,000
even galaxies beyond our galaxy that
that would that feel sad to me because

2408
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:22,010
that would that feel sad to me because
 

2409
00:53:22,010 --> 00:53:24,740
that would that feel sad to me because
because it's so limiting yeah there's

2410
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:24,750
because it's so limiting yeah there's
 

2411
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:27,020
because it's so limiting yeah there's
something hopeful and beautiful bar

2412
00:53:27,020 --> 00:53:27,030
something hopeful and beautiful bar
 

2413
00:53:27,030 --> 00:53:29,440
something hopeful and beautiful bar
reaching out any kind of exploration

2414
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:29,450
reaching out any kind of exploration
 

2415
00:53:29,450 --> 00:53:33,170
reaching out any kind of exploration
reaching out across earth centuries ago

2416
00:53:33,170 --> 00:53:33,180
reaching out across earth centuries ago
 

2417
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:35,420
reaching out across earth centuries ago
and reaching out into space so what do

2418
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:35,430
and reaching out into space so what do
 

2419
00:53:35,430 --> 00:53:37,280
and reaching out into space so what do
you think about colonization of Mars so

2420
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:37,290
you think about colonization of Mars so
 

2421
00:53:37,290 --> 00:53:38,990
you think about colonization of Mars so
go to Mars does that excite you the idea

2422
00:53:38,990 --> 00:53:39,000
go to Mars does that excite you the idea
 

2423
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,670
go to Mars does that excite you the idea
of a human being stepping foot on Mars

2424
00:53:40,670 --> 00:53:40,680
of a human being stepping foot on Mars
 

2425
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:43,730
of a human being stepping foot on Mars
it does it absolutely does but in terms

2426
00:53:43,730 --> 00:53:43,740
it does it absolutely does but in terms
 

2427
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:45,500
it does it absolutely does but in terms
of what would really excite me it would

2428
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:45,510
of what would really excite me it would
 

2429
00:53:45,510 --> 00:53:47,540
of what would really excite me it would
be leaving this solar system in as much

2430
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:47,550
be leaving this solar system in as much
 

2431
00:53:47,550 --> 00:53:50,510
be leaving this solar system in as much
as that I just think I think we already

2432
00:53:50,510 --> 00:53:50,520
as that I just think I think we already
 

2433
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:53,810
as that I just think I think we already
know quite a lot about Mars and but yes

2434
00:53:53,810 --> 00:53:53,820
know quite a lot about Mars and but yes
 

2435
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:56,960
know quite a lot about Mars and but yes
listen if it happened that would be I

2436
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:56,970
listen if it happened that would be I
 

2437
00:53:56,970 --> 00:53:59,480
listen if it happened that would be I
hope I say in my lifetime I really hope

2438
00:53:59,480 --> 00:53:59,490
hope I say in my lifetime I really hope
 

2439
00:53:59,490 --> 00:54:01,610
hope I say in my lifetime I really hope
I say in my lifetime I do it would be a

2440
00:54:01,610 --> 00:54:01,620
I say in my lifetime I do it would be a
 

2441
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:04,400
I say in my lifetime I do it would be a
wonderful thing without giving anything

2442
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:04,410
wonderful thing without giving anything
 

2443
00:54:04,410 --> 00:54:09,410
wonderful thing without giving anything
away but the series begins with the use

2444
00:54:09,410 --> 00:54:09,420
away but the series begins with the use
 

2445
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:12,490
away but the series begins with the use
of quantum computers a new series does

2446
00:54:12,490 --> 00:54:12,500
of quantum computers a new series does
 

2447
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:14,600
of quantum computers a new series does
begins with the use of quantum computers

2448
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:14,610
begins with the use of quantum computers
 

2449
00:54:14,610 --> 00:54:16,970
begins with the use of quantum computers
to simulate basic living organisms or

2450
00:54:16,970 --> 00:54:16,980
to simulate basic living organisms or
 

2451
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:18,440
to simulate basic living organisms or
actually I don't know if it's quantum

2452
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:18,450
actually I don't know if it's quantum
 

2453
00:54:18,450 --> 00:54:20,930
actually I don't know if it's quantum
computers are used but basic living

2454
00:54:20,930 --> 00:54:20,940
computers are used but basic living
 

2455
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:22,970
computers are used but basic living
organisms simulated on a screen and yeah

2456
00:54:22,970 --> 00:54:22,980
organisms simulated on a screen and yeah
 

2457
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:24,710
organisms simulated on a screen and yeah
the cool kind of demo yeah that's right

2458
00:54:24,710 --> 00:54:24,720
the cool kind of demo yeah that's right
 

2459
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:27,200
the cool kind of demo yeah that's right
they're using yes they are using a

2460
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:27,210
they're using yes they are using a
 

2461
00:54:27,210 --> 00:54:30,440
they're using yes they are using a
quantum computer to simulate a nematode

2462
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:30,450
quantum computer to simulate a nematode
 

2463
00:54:30,450 --> 00:54:33,080
quantum computer to simulate a nematode
pill so returning to our discussion of

2464
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:33,090
pill so returning to our discussion of
 

2465
00:54:33,090 --> 00:54:37,940
pill so returning to our discussion of
simulation or thinking of the universe

2466
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:37,950
simulation or thinking of the universe
 

2467
00:54:37,950 --> 00:54:39,620
simulation or thinking of the universe
as a computer do you think the universe

2468
00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:39,630
as a computer do you think the universe
 

2469
00:54:39,630 --> 00:54:43,460
as a computer do you think the universe
is deterministic is there a free will so

2470
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:43,470
is deterministic is there a free will so
 

2471
00:54:43,470 --> 00:54:46,520
is deterministic is there a free will so
with the qualification of what do I know

2472
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:46,530
with the qualification of what do I know
 

2473
00:54:46,530 --> 00:54:49,550
with the qualification of what do I know
because I'm a layman right layperson but

2474
00:54:49,550 --> 00:54:49,560
because I'm a layman right layperson but
 

2475
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:52,820
because I'm a layman right layperson but
with big imagination thanks with that

2476
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:52,830
with big imagination thanks with that
 

2477
00:54:52,830 --> 00:54:55,730
with big imagination thanks with that
qualification yeah I think the universe

2478
00:54:55,730 --> 00:54:55,740
qualification yeah I think the universe
 

2479
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:58,490
qualification yeah I think the universe
is deterministic and I see absolutely I

2480
00:54:58,490 --> 00:54:58,500
is deterministic and I see absolutely I
 

2481
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:02,000
is deterministic and I see absolutely I
I cannot see how freewill fits into that

2482
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:02,010
I cannot see how freewill fits into that
 

2483
00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:02,750
I cannot see how freewill fits into that
so

2484
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:02,760
so
 

2485
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:05,180
so
so yes deterministic no free will that

2486
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:05,190
so yes deterministic no free will that
 

2487
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:07,610
so yes deterministic no free will that
would be my position and how does that

2488
00:55:07,610 --> 00:55:07,620
would be my position and how does that
 

2489
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:10,730
would be my position and how does that
make you feel it partly makes me feel

2490
00:55:10,730 --> 00:55:10,740
make you feel it partly makes me feel
 

2491
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:12,380
make you feel it partly makes me feel
that it's exactly in keeping

2492
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:12,390
that it's exactly in keeping
 

2493
00:55:12,390 --> 00:55:13,849
that it's exactly in keeping
with the way these things tend to work

2494
00:55:13,849 --> 00:55:13,859
with the way these things tend to work
 

2495
00:55:13,859 --> 00:55:16,279
with the way these things tend to work
out which is that we have an incredibly

2496
00:55:16,279 --> 00:55:16,289
out which is that we have an incredibly
 

2497
00:55:16,289 --> 00:55:19,779
out which is that we have an incredibly
strong sense that we do have free will

2498
00:55:19,779 --> 00:55:19,789
strong sense that we do have free will
 

2499
00:55:19,789 --> 00:55:23,839
strong sense that we do have free will
and just as we have an incredibly strong

2500
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:23,849
and just as we have an incredibly strong
 

2501
00:55:23,849 --> 00:55:28,430
and just as we have an incredibly strong
sense that time is a constant and turns

2502
00:55:28,430 --> 00:55:28,440
sense that time is a constant and turns
 

2503
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:30,170
sense that time is a constant and turns
out probably not to be the case or

2504
00:55:30,170 --> 00:55:30,180
out probably not to be the case or
 

2505
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:32,420
out probably not to be the case or
definitely in the case of time but but

2506
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:32,430
definitely in the case of time but but
 

2507
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:35,150
definitely in the case of time but but
but it's the the problem I always have

2508
00:55:35,150 --> 00:55:35,160
but it's the the problem I always have
 

2509
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:38,539
but it's the the problem I always have
with free will is that it gets I can

2510
00:55:38,539 --> 00:55:38,549
with free will is that it gets I can
 

2511
00:55:38,549 --> 00:55:40,970
with free will is that it gets I can
never seem to find the place where it is

2512
00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:40,980
never seem to find the place where it is
 

2513
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:45,019
never seem to find the place where it is
supposed to reside and yet you explore

2514
00:55:45,019 --> 00:55:45,029
supposed to reside and yet you explore
 

2515
00:55:45,029 --> 00:55:47,359
supposed to reside and yet you explore
just but a very very but we have

2516
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:47,369
just but a very very but we have
 

2517
00:55:47,369 --> 00:55:49,910
just but a very very but we have
something we can call free will but it's

2518
00:55:49,910 --> 00:55:49,920
something we can call free will but it's
 

2519
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:52,039
something we can call free will but it's
not the thing that we think it is but

2520
00:55:52,039 --> 00:55:52,049
not the thing that we think it is but
 

2521
00:55:52,049 --> 00:55:55,460
not the thing that we think it is but
free was so what we call free will is

2522
00:55:55,460 --> 00:55:55,470
free was so what we call free will is
 

2523
00:55:55,470 --> 00:55:56,660
free was so what we call free will is
just what they call it as the illusion

2524
00:55:56,660 --> 00:55:56,670
just what they call it as the illusion
 

2525
00:55:56,670 --> 00:55:58,370
just what they call it as the illusion
of it and that's a subjective experience

2526
00:55:58,370 --> 00:55:58,380
of it and that's a subjective experience
 

2527
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:00,710
of it and that's a subjective experience
of yeah the yeah yeah which is a useful

2528
00:56:00,710 --> 00:56:00,720
of yeah the yeah yeah which is a useful
 

2529
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:03,559
of yeah the yeah yeah which is a useful
thing to have and it partly it partly

2530
00:56:03,559 --> 00:56:03,569
thing to have and it partly it partly
 

2531
00:56:03,569 --> 00:56:05,299
thing to have and it partly it partly
comes down to although we live in a

2532
00:56:05,299 --> 00:56:05,309
comes down to although we live in a
 

2533
00:56:05,309 --> 00:56:07,519
comes down to although we live in a
deterministic universe our brains are

2534
00:56:07,519 --> 00:56:07,529
deterministic universe our brains are
 

2535
00:56:07,529 --> 00:56:08,839
deterministic universe our brains are
not very well equipped to fully

2536
00:56:08,839 --> 00:56:08,849
not very well equipped to fully
 

2537
00:56:08,849 --> 00:56:11,269
not very well equipped to fully
determine the deterministic universe so

2538
00:56:11,269 --> 00:56:11,279
determine the deterministic universe so
 

2539
00:56:11,279 --> 00:56:13,460
determine the deterministic universe so
we're constantly surprised and feel like

2540
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:13,470
we're constantly surprised and feel like
 

2541
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:15,500
we're constantly surprised and feel like
we're making snap decision decisions

2542
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:15,510
we're making snap decision decisions
 

2543
00:56:15,510 --> 00:56:17,779
we're making snap decision decisions
based on imperfect information so that

2544
00:56:17,779 --> 00:56:17,789
based on imperfect information so that
 

2545
00:56:17,789 --> 00:56:20,539
based on imperfect information so that
feels a lot like freewill it just isn't

2546
00:56:20,539 --> 00:56:20,549
feels a lot like freewill it just isn't
 

2547
00:56:20,549 --> 00:56:24,349
feels a lot like freewill it just isn't
it would be might that's why I guess so

2548
00:56:24,349 --> 00:56:24,359
it would be might that's why I guess so
 

2549
00:56:24,359 --> 00:56:27,170
it would be might that's why I guess so
in that sense your sort of sense is that

2550
00:56:27,170 --> 00:56:27,180
in that sense your sort of sense is that
 

2551
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:29,779
in that sense your sort of sense is that
you can unroll the universe forward or

2552
00:56:29,779 --> 00:56:29,789
you can unroll the universe forward or
 

2553
00:56:29,789 --> 00:56:32,630
you can unroll the universe forward or
backward and you will see the same thing

2554
00:56:32,630 --> 00:56:32,640
backward and you will see the same thing
 

2555
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:36,829
backward and you will see the same thing
and you would I mean that notion yeah

2556
00:56:36,829 --> 00:56:36,839
and you would I mean that notion yeah
 

2557
00:56:36,839 --> 00:56:39,950
and you would I mean that notion yeah
sort of sort of but yeah sorry go ahead

2558
00:56:39,950 --> 00:56:39,960
sort of sort of but yeah sorry go ahead
 

2559
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:42,970
sort of sort of but yeah sorry go ahead
I mean that notion is a bit

2560
00:56:42,970 --> 00:56:42,980
I mean that notion is a bit
 

2561
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:46,549
I mean that notion is a bit
uncomfortable to think about that it's

2562
00:56:46,549 --> 00:56:46,559
uncomfortable to think about that it's
 

2563
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:51,249
uncomfortable to think about that it's
good you can roll it back and and

2564
00:56:51,249 --> 00:56:51,259
good you can roll it back and and
 

2565
00:56:51,259 --> 00:56:54,859
good you can roll it back and and
forward and well if you were able to do

2566
00:56:54,859 --> 00:56:54,869
forward and well if you were able to do
 

2567
00:56:54,869 --> 00:56:56,150
forward and well if you were able to do
it it would certainly have to be a

2568
00:56:56,150 --> 00:56:56,160
it it would certainly have to be a
 

2569
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,579
it it would certainly have to be a
quantum computer yeah something that

2570
00:56:58,579 --> 00:56:58,589
quantum computer yeah something that
 

2571
00:56:58,589 --> 00:57:01,039
quantum computer yeah something that
worked in a quantum mechanical way in

2572
00:57:01,039 --> 00:57:01,049
worked in a quantum mechanical way in
 

2573
00:57:01,049 --> 00:57:03,230
worked in a quantum mechanical way in
order to understand a quantum mechanical

2574
00:57:03,230 --> 00:57:03,240
order to understand a quantum mechanical
 

2575
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:08,120
order to understand a quantum mechanical
system I I guess but but and so that

2576
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:08,130
system I I guess but but and so that
 

2577
00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:09,589
system I I guess but but and so that
unrolling there may be a multiverse

2578
00:57:09,589 --> 00:57:09,599
unrolling there may be a multiverse
 

2579
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:10,999
unrolling there may be a multiverse
thing where there's a bunch of branching

2580
00:57:10,999 --> 00:57:11,009
thing where there's a bunch of branching
 

2581
00:57:11,009 --> 00:57:12,950
thing where there's a bunch of branching
what will exactly because it wouldn't

2582
00:57:12,950 --> 00:57:12,960
what will exactly because it wouldn't
 

2583
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:14,870
what will exactly because it wouldn't
follow that every time you roll it back

2584
00:57:14,870 --> 00:57:14,880
follow that every time you roll it back
 

2585
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,370
follow that every time you roll it back
or forward you'd get exactly the same

2586
00:57:16,370 --> 00:57:16,380
or forward you'd get exactly the same
 

2587
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:18,920
or forward you'd get exactly the same
result which is another thing that's

2588
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:18,930
result which is another thing that's
 

2589
00:57:18,930 --> 00:57:23,630
result which is another thing that's
hard to rapamycin fact yeah but but but

2590
00:57:23,630 --> 00:57:23,640
hard to rapamycin fact yeah but but but
 

2591
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:25,700
hard to rapamycin fact yeah but but but
that yes it but essentially what you

2592
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:25,710
that yes it but essentially what you
 

2593
00:57:25,710 --> 00:57:26,240
that yes it but essentially what you
just described

2594
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:26,250
just described
 

2595
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:29,150
just described
that the the yes forwards and yes

2596
00:57:29,150 --> 00:57:29,160
that the the yes forwards and yes
 

2597
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:30,590
that the the yes forwards and yes
backwards but you might get a slightly

2598
00:57:30,590 --> 00:57:30,600
backwards but you might get a slightly
 

2599
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:32,630
backwards but you might get a slightly
different result works very different

2600
00:57:32,630 --> 00:57:32,640
different result works very different
 

2601
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:34,220
different result works very different
though or very different

2602
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:34,230
though or very different
 

2603
00:57:34,230 --> 00:57:36,020
though or very different
along the same lines well you've

2604
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:36,030
along the same lines well you've
 

2605
00:57:36,030 --> 00:57:37,790
along the same lines well you've
explored some really deep scientific

2606
00:57:37,790 --> 00:57:37,800
explored some really deep scientific
 

2607
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:40,610
explored some really deep scientific
ideas in this new series and I mean it's

2608
00:57:40,610 --> 00:57:40,620
ideas in this new series and I mean it's
 

2609
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:43,850
ideas in this new series and I mean it's
just in general you're unafraid to to

2610
00:57:43,850 --> 00:57:43,860
just in general you're unafraid to to
 

2611
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:45,920
just in general you're unafraid to to
ground yourself and some of the most

2612
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:45,930
ground yourself and some of the most
 

2613
00:57:45,930 --> 00:57:48,670
ground yourself and some of the most
amazing scientific ideas of our time

2614
00:57:48,670 --> 00:57:48,680
amazing scientific ideas of our time
 

2615
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:51,170
amazing scientific ideas of our time
what what are the things you've learned

2616
00:57:51,170 --> 00:57:51,180
what what are the things you've learned
 

2617
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:53,210
what what are the things you've learned
or ideas you find beautiful mysterious

2618
00:57:53,210 --> 00:57:53,220
or ideas you find beautiful mysterious

about quantum mechanics multiverse

about quantum mechanics multiverse
string theory quantum computing that

2622
00:57:56,750 --> 00:57:56,760
string theory quantum computing that
 

2623
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:59,840
string theory quantum computing that
you've learned well I would have to say

2624
00:57:59,840 --> 00:57:59,850
you've learned well I would have to say
 

2625
00:57:59,850 --> 00:58:01,970
you've learned well I would have to say
every single thing I've learned is

2626
00:58:01,970 --> 00:58:01,980
every single thing I've learned is
 

2627
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:05,390
every single thing I've learned is
beautiful and one of the motivators for

2628
00:58:05,390 --> 00:58:05,400
beautiful and one of the motivators for
 

2629
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:10,250
beautiful and one of the motivators for
me is that I think that people tend not

2630
00:58:10,250 --> 00:58:10,260
me is that I think that people tend not
 

2631
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:14,060
me is that I think that people tend not
to see scientific thinking as being

2632
00:58:14,060 --> 00:58:14,070
to see scientific thinking as being
 

2633
00:58:14,070 --> 00:58:17,990
to see scientific thinking as being
essentially poetic and lyrical but but I

2634
00:58:17,990 --> 00:58:18,000
essentially poetic and lyrical but but I
 

2635
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,090
essentially poetic and lyrical but but I
think that is literally exactly what it

2636
00:58:20,090 --> 00:58:20,100
think that is literally exactly what it
 

2637
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:23,690
think that is literally exactly what it
is and I think the idea of entanglement

2638
00:58:23,690 --> 00:58:23,700
is and I think the idea of entanglement
 

2639
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:26,030
is and I think the idea of entanglement
or the idea of superpositions or the

2640
00:58:26,030 --> 00:58:26,040
or the idea of superpositions or the
 

2641
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:27,440
or the idea of superpositions or the
fact that you could even demonstrate a

2642
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:27,450
fact that you could even demonstrate a
 

2643
00:58:27,450 --> 00:58:29,510
fact that you could even demonstrate a
superposition or have a machine that

2644
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:29,520
superposition or have a machine that
 

2645
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:31,550

01:00:59,670 --> 01:01:01,700
are not and so that that I suspect would
be very very disturbing to a lot of

be very very disturbing to a lot of

or negative effect on society the the

01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:09,270
realization that you are not you cannot
 

2751
01:01:09,270 --> 01:01:11,330

is the way that could be interpreted

01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:12,870
is the way that could be interpreted
 

2755
01:01:12,870 --> 01:01:16,220
is the way that could be interpreted
yeah although in some ways we

2756
01:01:16,220 --> 01:01:16,230
yeah although in some ways we
 

2757
01:01:16,230 --> 01:01:17,930
yeah although in some ways we
instinctively understand that already

2758
01:01:17,930 --> 01:01:17,940
instinctively understand that already
 

2759
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:19,790
instinctively understand that already
because in the example I gave you of the

2760
01:01:19,790 --> 01:01:19,800
because in the example I gave you of the
 

2761
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:22,250
because in the example I gave you of the
kid in the stabbing we would all

2762
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:22,260
kid in the stabbing we would all
 

2763
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:24,380
kid in the stabbing we would all
understand that that kid was not really

2764
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:24,390
understand that that kid was not really
 

2765
01:01:24,390 --> 01:01:25,820
understand that that kid was not really
fully in control of their actions so

2766
01:01:25,820 --> 01:01:25,830
fully in control of their actions so
 

2767
01:01:25,830 --> 01:01:27,890
fully in control of their actions so
it's not an idea that's entirely alien

2768
01:01:27,890 --> 01:01:27,900
it's not an idea that's entirely alien
 

2769
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:30,590
it's not an idea that's entirely alien
to us but I don't know we understand

2770
01:01:30,590 --> 01:01:30,600
to us but I don't know we understand
 

2771
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:33,260
to us but I don't know we understand
that I think there's a bunch of people

2772
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:33,270
that I think there's a bunch of people
 

2773
01:01:33,270 --> 01:01:36,500
that I think there's a bunch of people
who see the world that way but not

2774
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:36,510
who see the world that way but not
 

2775
01:01:36,510 --> 01:01:38,240
who see the world that way but not
everybody yes true

2776
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:38,250
everybody yes true
 

2777
01:01:38,250 --> 01:01:41,240
everybody yes true
i but what this machine would do is is

2778
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:41,250
i but what this machine would do is is
 

2779
01:01:41,250 --> 01:01:43,880
i but what this machine would do is is
prove it any doubt because someone would

2780
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:43,890
prove it any doubt because someone would
 

2781
01:01:43,890 --> 01:01:46,070
prove it any doubt because someone would
say well I don't believe that's true and

2782
01:01:46,070 --> 01:01:46,080
say well I don't believe that's true and
 

2783
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:48,260
say well I don't believe that's true and
then you'd predict well in 10 seconds

2784
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:48,270
then you'd predict well in 10 seconds
 

2785
01:01:48,270 --> 01:01:49,280
then you'd predict well in 10 seconds
you're going to do this and they'd say

2786
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:49,290
you're going to do this and they'd say
 

2787
01:01:49,290 --> 01:01:50,960
you're going to do this and they'd say
no no I'm not and then they'd do it and

2788
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:50,970
no no I'm not and then they'd do it and
 

2789
01:01:50,970 --> 01:01:52,400
no no I'm not and then they'd do it and
then determine is

2790
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:52,410
then determine is
 

2791
01:01:52,410 --> 01:01:54,980
then determine is
would have played its part but I or

2792
01:01:54,980 --> 01:01:54,990
would have played its part but I or
 

2793
01:01:54,990 --> 01:01:58,100
would have played its part but I or
something like that but actually the

2794
01:01:58,100 --> 01:01:58,110
something like that but actually the
 

2795
01:01:58,110 --> 01:01:59,840
something like that but actually the
exact terms of that thought experiment

2796
01:01:59,840 --> 01:01:59,850
exact terms of that thought experiment
 

2797
01:01:59,850 --> 01:02:02,510
exact terms of that thought experiment
probably wouldn't play out but but still

2798
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:02,520
probably wouldn't play out but but still
 

2799
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:04,460
probably wouldn't play out but but still
broadly speaking you could predict

2800
01:02:04,460 --> 01:02:04,470
broadly speaking you could predict
 

2801
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:06,320
broadly speaking you could predict
something happening in another room sort

would find it very disturbing but then
 

2811
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:17,780
would find it very disturbing but then
after they'd got over their sense of

01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:45,380
stuff I remember my daughter saying to
me wish it she'd got hold of the idea

2832
01:02:45,380 --> 01:02:45,390
me wish it she'd got hold of the idea
 

2833
01:02:45,390 --> 01:02:47,180
me wish it she'd got hold of the idea
that my view of the universe made it

2834
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:47,190
that my view of the universe made it
 

2835
01:02:47,190 --> 01:02:49,250
that my view of the universe made it
meaningless and she said well then it's

2836
01:02:49,250 --> 01:02:49,260
meaningless and she said well then it's
 

2837
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:51,200
meaningless and she said well then it's
meaningless and I said well it I can

2838
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:51,210
meaningless and I said well it I can
 

2839
01:02:51,210 --> 01:02:53,660
meaningless and I said well it I can
prove it's not meaningless because you

2840
01:02:53,660 --> 01:02:53,670
prove it's not meaningless because you
 

2841
01:02:53,670 --> 01:02:55,580
prove it's not meaningless because you
mean something to me and I mean

2842
01:02:55,580 --> 01:02:55,590
mean something to me and I mean
 

2843
01:02:55,590 --> 01:02:57,110
mean something to me and I mean
something to you so it's not completely

2844
01:02:57,110 --> 01:02:57,120
something to you so it's not completely
 

2845
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:59,300
something to you so it's not completely
meaningless because there is a bit of

2846
01:02:59,300 --> 01:02:59,310
meaningless because there is a bit of
 

2847
01:02:59,310 --> 01:03:01,520
meaningless because there is a bit of
meaning contained within this space and

2848
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:01,530
meaning contained within this space and
 

2849
01:03:01,530 --> 01:03:06,110
meaning contained within this space and
so with a lack of free will space you

2850
01:03:06,110 --> 01:03:06,120
so with a lack of free will space you
 

2851
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:07,310
so with a lack of free will space you
could think well this robs me of

2852
01:03:07,310 --> 01:03:07,320
could think well this robs me of
 

2853
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:09,140
could think well this robs me of
everything I am and then you'd say well

2854
01:03:09,140 --> 01:03:09,150
everything I am and then you'd say well
 

2855
01:03:09,150 --> 01:03:10,850
everything I am and then you'd say well
no it doesn't because you still like

2856
01:03:10,850 --> 01:03:10,860
no it doesn't because you still like
 

2857
01:03:10,860 --> 01:03:12,650
no it doesn't because you still like
eating cheeseburgers and you still like

2858
01:03:12,650 --> 01:03:12,660
eating cheeseburgers and you still like
 

2859
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:15,440
eating cheeseburgers and you still like
going to see the movies and so so how

2860
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:15,450
going to see the movies and so so how
 

2861
01:03:15,450 --> 01:03:18,110
going to see the movies and so so how
big a difference does it really make but

2862
01:03:18,110 --> 01:03:18,120
big a difference does it really make but
 

2863
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:19,940
big a difference does it really make but

01:03:22,940 --> 01:03:22,950
find it very disturbing I think I think
 

2867
01:03:22,950 --> 01:03:25,310
find it very disturbing I think I think
that what would come if you could really

2868
01:03:25,310 --> 01:03:25,320
that what would come if you could really
 

2869
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:27,770
that what would come if you could really
unlock with a determinism machine

2870
01:03:27,770 --> 01:03:27,780
unlock with a determinism machine
 

2871
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:29,360
unlock with a determinism machine
everything there'd be this wonderful

2872
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:29,370
everything there'd be this wonderful
 

2873
01:03:29,370 --> 01:03:31,250
everything there'd be this wonderful
wisdom that would come from and I'd

2874

wisdom that would come from and I'd
 

2875
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:34,910
wisdom that would come from and I'd
rather have that than not so that's a

2876
01:03:34,910 --> 01:03:34,920
rather have that than not so that's a
 

2877
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:36,820
rather have that than not so that's a
really good example of a technology

2878
01:03:36,820 --> 01:03:36,830
really good example of a technology
 

2879

more and more interesting but it makes
 

2935
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:46,710
more and more interesting but it makes

attached to it I suspect if we ever

01:05:07,950 --> 01:05:07,960
attached to it I suspect if we ever
 

2955
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:11,550
attached to it I suspect if we ever
unravel it it will turn out to be less

2956

unravel it it will turn out to be less
 

2957
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:14,940
unravel it it will turn out to be less
than we thought in a way and perhaps

2958
01:05:14,940 --> 01:05:14,950
than we thought in a way and perhaps
 

2959
01:05:14,950 --> 01:05:17,730
than we thought in a way and perhaps
your very own Exceptionalist assertion

2960
01:05:17,730 --> 01:05:17,740
your very own Exceptionalist assertion
 

2961
01:05:17,740 --> 01:05:19,320
your very own Exceptionalist assertion
earlier on in our conversation that

2962
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:19,330
earlier on in our conversation that
 

2963
01:05:19,330 --> 01:05:21,740
earlier on in our conversation that
consciousness is something belongs to us

2964
01:05:21,740 --> 01:05:21,750
consciousness is something belongs to us
 

2965
01:05:21,750 --> 01:05:24,810
consciousness is something belongs to us
humans or not humans belong organisms

2966
01:05:24,810 --> 01:05:24,820
humans or not humans belong organisms
 

2967
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:27,810
humans or not humans belong organisms
maybe you will one day find out that

2968
01:05:27,810 --> 01:05:27,820
maybe you will one day find out that
 

2969
01:05:27,820 --> 01:05:30,540
maybe you will one day find out that
consciousness is in everything and that

2970
01:05:30,540 --> 01:05:30,550
consciousness is in everything and that
 

2971
01:05:30,550 --> 01:05:33,240
consciousness is in everything and that
will yeah will humble you exact if that

2972
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:33,250
will yeah will humble you exact if that
 

2973
01:05:33,250 --> 01:05:35,190
will yeah will humble you exact if that
was true it would certainly humble me

2974
01:05:35,190 --> 01:05:35,200
was true it would certainly humble me
 

2975
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:38,940
was true it would certainly humble me
although maybe almost maybe I don't know

2976
01:05:38,940 --> 01:05:38,950
although maybe almost maybe I don't know
 

2977
01:05:38,950 --> 01:05:43,220
although maybe almost maybe I don't know
I don't know what effect that would have

2978
01:05:43,220 --> 01:05:43,230

 

2979
01:05:43,230 --> 01:05:45,690

aye-aye-aye sort of I mean my

2980
01:05:45,690 --> 01:05:45,700
aye-aye-aye sort of I mean my
 

2981
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:47,580
aye-aye-aye sort of I mean my
understanding of that principle is along

2982
01:05:47,580 --> 01:05:47,590
understanding of that principle is along
 

2983
01:05:47,590 --> 01:05:50,520
understanding of that principle is along
the lines of say that that an electron

2984
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:50,530
the lines of say that that an electron
 

2985
01:05:50,530 --> 01:05:53,610
the lines of say that that an electron
has a preferred state or it may or may

2986
01:05:53,610 --> 01:05:53,620
has a preferred state or it may or may
 

2987
01:05:53,620 --> 01:05:56,820
has a preferred state or it may or may
not pass through a bed of glass it may

2988
01:05:56,820 --> 01:05:56,830
not pass through a bed of glass it may
 

2989
01:05:56,830 --> 01:05:58,380
not pass through a bed of glass it may
reflect off or it may go through or

2990
01:05:58,380 --> 01:05:58,390
reflect off or it may go through or
 

2991
01:05:58,390 --> 01:06:00,290
reflect off or it may go through or
something like that and and so that

2992
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:00,300
something like that and and so that
 

2993
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:06,410
something like that and and so that
feels as if a choice has been made and

2994
01:06:06,410 --> 01:06:06,420

 

2995
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:09,330

but if if I'm going down the fully

2996
01:06:09,330 --> 01:06:09,340
but if if I'm going down the fully
 

2997
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:11,580
but if if I'm going down the fully
deterministic routes I would say there's

2998
01:06:11,580 --> 01:06:11,590
deterministic routes I would say there's
 

2999
01:06:11,590 --> 01:06:13,500
deterministic routes I would say there's
just an underlying determinism that has

3000
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:13,510
just an underlying determinism that has
 

3001
01:06:13,510 --> 01:06:15,510
just an underlying determinism that has
defined that that is defined the

3002
01:06:15,510 --> 01:06:15,520
defined that that is defined the
 

3003
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:17,580
defined that that is defined the
preferred state or the reflection or non

3004
01:06:17,580 --> 01:06:17,590
preferred state or the reflection or non
 

3005
01:06:17,590 --> 01:06:18,410
preferred state or the reflection or non
reflections

3006
01:06:18,410 --> 01:06:18,420
reflections
 

3007
01:06:18,420 --> 01:06:20,960
reflections
but look yeah you're right if if if it

3008
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:20,970
but look yeah you're right if if if it
 

3009
01:06:20,970 --> 01:06:22,400
but look yeah you're right if if if it
turned out that there was a thing that

3010
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:22,410
turned out that there was a thing that
 

3011
01:06:22,410 --> 01:06:25,630
turned out that there was a thing that
it was like to be the Sun then I would

3012
01:06:25,630 --> 01:06:25,640
it was like to be the Sun then I would
 

3013
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:28,460
it was like to be the Sun then I would
I'd be amazed and humbled I'd be happy

3014
01:06:28,460 --> 01:06:28,470
I'd be amazed and humbled I'd be happy
 

3015
01:06:28,470 --> 01:06:30,110
I'd be amazed and humbled I'd be happy

3016
01:06:30,110 --> 01:06:30,120
to be both it sounds pretty cool and
 

3017
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:31,730
to be both it sounds pretty cool and
they'll be you'll say the same thing as

3018
01:06:31,730 --> 01:06:31,740
they'll be you'll say the same thing as
 

3019
01:06:31,740 --> 01:06:32,900
they'll be you'll say the same thing as
you said to your daughter but it's

3020

you said to your daughter but it's
 

3021
01:06:32,910 --> 01:06:34,700

nevertheless feels something like to be
 

3023
01:06:34,710 --> 01:06:38,650
nevertheless feels something like to be
me and that that's pretty damn good yeah

what will Alex Carlin be remembered for

3054
01:07:23,330 --> 01:07:23,340
what will Alex Carlin be remembered for
 

3055
01:07:23,340 --> 01:07:25,640
what will Alex Carlin be remembered for
from something you've created already or

3056
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:25,650
from something you've created already or
 

3057
01:07:25,650 --> 01:07:27,770
from something you've created already or
feel you may feel somewhere deep inside

3058
01:07:27,770 --> 01:07:27,780
feel you may feel somewhere deep inside
 

3059
01:07:27,780 --> 01:07:31,670
feel you may feel somewhere deep inside
you may still create well ok well I'll

3060
01:07:31,670 --> 01:07:31,680
you may still create well ok well I'll
 

3061
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:32,930
you may still create well ok well I'll
take I'll take the question in the

3062
01:07:32,930 --> 01:07:32,940
take I'll take the question in the
 

3063
01:07:32,940 --> 01:07:36,370
take I'll take the question in the
spirit was asked but very generous

3064
01:07:36,370 --> 01:07:36,380
spirit was asked but very generous
 

3065
01:07:36,380 --> 01:07:43,580
spirit was asked but very generous
gunpoint yeah what what I what I try to

3066
01:07:43,580 --> 01:07:43,590
gunpoint yeah what what I what I try to
 

3067
01:07:43,590 --> 01:07:44,240
gunpoint yeah what what I what I try to
do

3068
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:44,250
do
 

3069
01:07:44,250 --> 01:07:48,500
do
so therefore what I hope yeah if I

3070
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:48,510
so therefore what I hope yeah if I
 

3071
01:07:48,510 --> 01:07:50,210
so therefore what I hope yeah if I
remembered what I might be remembered

3072
01:07:50,210 --> 01:07:50,220
remembered what I might be remembered
 

3073
01:07:50,220 --> 01:07:53,210
remembered what I might be remembered
for is is as someone who who

3074
01:07:53,210 --> 01:07:53,220
for is is as someone who who
 

3075
01:07:53,220 --> 01:07:56,060
for is is as someone who who
participates in a conversation and I

3076
01:07:56,060 --> 01:07:56,070
participates in a conversation and I
 

3077
01:07:56,070 --> 01:07:58,640
participates in a conversation and I
think that often what happens is people

3078
01:07:58,640 --> 01:07:58,650
think that often what happens is people
 

3079
01:07:58,650 --> 01:08:01,040
think that often what happens is people
don't participate in conversations they

3080
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:01,050
don't participate in conversations they
 

3081
01:08:01,050 --> 01:08:03,860
don't participate in conversations they
make proclamations they make statements

3082
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:03,870
make proclamations they make statements
 

3083
01:08:03,870 --> 01:08:06,380
make proclamations they make statements
and people can either react against the

3084
01:08:06,380 --> 01:08:06,390
and people can either react against the
 

3085
01:08:06,390 --> 01:08:08,330
and people can either react against the
statement or can fall in line behind it

3086
01:08:08,330 --> 01:08:08,340
statement or can fall in line behind it
 

3087
01:08:08,340 --> 01:08:11,360
statement or can fall in line behind it
and I don't like that so I want to be

3088
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:11,370
and I don't like that so I want to be
 

3089
01:08:11,370 --> 01:08:14,300
and I don't like that so I want to be
part of a conversation I take as a sort

3090
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:14,310
part of a conversation I take as a sort
 

3091
01:08:14,310 --> 01:08:16,250
part of a conversation I take as a sort
of basic principle I think I take lots

3092
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:16,260
of basic principle I think I take lots
 

3093
01:08:16,260 --> 01:08:18,080
of basic principle I think I take lots
of my cues from science but one of the

3094
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:18,090
of my cues from science but one of the
 

3095
01:08:18,090 --> 01:08:19,880
of my cues from science but one of the
best ones it seems to me is that when a

3096
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:19,890
best ones it seems to me is that when a
 

3097
01:08:19,890 --> 01:08:21,980
best ones it seems to me is that when a
scientist has something proved wrong

3098
01:08:21,980 --> 01:08:21,990
scientist has something proved wrong
 

3099
01:08:21,990 --> 01:08:24,110
scientist has something proved wrong
that they previously believed in they

3100
01:08:24,110 --> 01:08:24,120
that they previously believed in they
 

3101
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:26,780
that they previously believed in they
then have to abandon that position so

3102
01:08:26,780 --> 01:08:26,790
then have to abandon that position so
 

3103
01:08:26,790 --> 01:08:28,430
then have to abandon that position so
I'd like to be someone who is allied to

3104
01:08:28,430 --> 01:08:28,440
I'd like to be someone who is allied to
 

3105
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:31,100
I'd like to be someone who is allied to
that sort of thinking so part of an

3106
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:31,110
that sort of thinking so part of an
 

3107
01:08:31,110 --> 01:08:31,700
that sort of thinking so part of an
exchange

3108
01:08:31,700 --> 01:08:31,710
exchange
 

3109
01:08:31,710 --> 01:08:35,329
exchange
part of an exchange of ideas and the

3110
01:08:35,329 --> 01:08:35,339
part of an exchange of ideas and the
 

3111
01:08:35,339 --> 01:08:37,400
part of an exchange of ideas and the
exchange of ideas for me is something

3112
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:37,410
exchange of ideas for me is something
 

3113
