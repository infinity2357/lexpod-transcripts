guess the hope
part of that is because we are

258
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:38,560
part of that is because we are
 

259
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,150
part of that is because we are
surrounded by mystery

260
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:40,160
surrounded by mystery
 

261
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,710
surrounded by mystery
so we've one way to say it if you look

262
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:42,720
so we've one way to say it if you look
 

263
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,670
so we've one way to say it if you look
at the growth the

264
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:43,680
at the growth the
 

265
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,629
at the growth the
gdp over time that we figured out quite

00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:46,639
gdp over time that we figured out quite
 

267
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:47,670
gdp over time that we figured out quite
a lot and we're

a lot and we're
 

269
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,230
a lot and we're
able to improve the quality of life

270
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:50,240
able to improve the quality of life
 

271
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,189
able to improve the quality of life
because of that

272
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:51,199
because of that
 

273
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,790
because of that
and we've figured out some fundamental

274
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:52,800
and we've figured out some fundamental
 

275
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,790
and we've figured out some fundamental
things about this universe but we still

276
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:54,800
things about this universe but we still
 

277
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,270
things about this universe but we still
don't know how much mystery there is

278
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:57,280
don't know how much mystery there is
 

279
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,070
don't know how much mystery there is
and it's also possible that there's some

280
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:00,080
and it's also possible that there's some
 

281
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,629
and it's also possible that there's some
things that are in fact

the sad thing is we may not know it

288
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:11,520
the sad thing is we may not know it
 

289
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,150
the sad thing is we may not know it
because

290
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:12,160
because
 

291
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,230
because
in fact they are incomprehensible and

in fact they are incomprehensible and
 

293
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,909
in fact they are incomprehensible and
that's the open question is

294
00:05:15,909 --> 00:05:15,919
that's the open question is
 

295
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,029
that's the open question is
how much of the universe is

296

how much of the universe is
 

297
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,270
how much of the universe is
comprehensible if we figured out

00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:19,280
comprehensible if we figured out
 

299
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,469

does that still give us the key to

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,629
does that still give us the key to

when we say the universe is

when we say the universe is
comprehensible we have to

comprehensible we have to
 

343
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,350
comprehensible we have to
kind of draw careful distinctions about

kind of draw careful distinctions about

on the other hand uh as i said as with
 

399
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,749
on the other hand uh as i said as with
as we get better answers we can also ask

400
00:07:05,749 --> 00:07:05,759
as we get better answers we can also ask
 

401
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,430
as we get better answers we can also ask
more ambitious questions and there are

402
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:07,440
more ambitious questions and there are
 

403
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,110
more ambitious questions and there are
certainly things that

404
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:09,120
certainly things that
 

405
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,629
certainly things that
have been observed even in the

have been observed even in the
 

407
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,309
have been observed even in the
in what would be usually called the

408
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:14,319
in what would be usually called the
 

409
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,790
in what would be usually called the
realm of physics that aren't understood

410
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:16,800
realm of physics that aren't understood
 

411
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,990
realm of physics that aren't understood
for instance there seems to be another

00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:20,000
for instance there seems to be another
 

413
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,749
for instance there seems to be another
source of mass in the universe the

414
00:07:21,749 --> 00:07:21,759
source of mass in the universe the
 

415
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,589
source of mass in the universe the
so-called dark matter

416
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:23,599
so-called dark matter
 

417
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,270
so-called dark matter
that we don't know what it is and it's a

418
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:25,280
that we don't know what it is and it's a
 

419
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,870
that we don't know what it is and it's a
very interesting question what it is

420
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:28,880
very interesting question what it is
 

421
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,390
very interesting question what it is
then uh but also as you were alluding to

422
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:32,400
then uh but also as you were alluding to
 

423
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:32,790
then uh but also as you were alluding to
there

424
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:32,800
there
 

425
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,350
there
there's it's one thing to know the basic

426
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:35,360
there's it's one thing to know the basic
 

427
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,629
there's it's one thing to know the basic
equations

428
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:36,639
equations
 

429
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,430
equations
it's another thing to be able to solve

430
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:39,440
it's another thing to be able to solve
 

431
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:39,830
it's another thing to be able to solve
them

432
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:39,840
them
 

433
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,189
them
in in important cases so we run a

00:07:43,189 --> 00:07:43,199
in in important cases so we run a
 

435
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,670
in in important cases so we run a
we run up against the limits of that in

436
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:45,680
we run up against the limits of that in
 

437
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,309
we run up against the limits of that in
things like

438
00:07:46,309 --> 00:07:46,319
things like
 

439
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,550
things like
chemistry where we'd like to be able to

440
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:48,560
chemistry where we'd like to be able to
 

441
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,230
chemistry where we'd like to be able to
design molecules and predict their

442
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:50,240
design molecules and predict their
 

443
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,110
design molecules and predict their
behavior

444
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:51,120
behavior
 

445
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,629
behavior
from the equations we think the

446
00:07:52,629 --> 00:07:52,639
from the equations we think the
 

447
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,309
from the equations we think the
equations could do that

448
00:07:54,309 --> 00:07:54,319
equations could do that
 

449
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,510
equations could do that
in principle but but uh

450
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:57,520
in principle but but uh
 

451
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,830
in principle but but uh
in practice it's very challenging to

452
00:07:59,830 --> 00:07:59,840
in practice it's very challenging to
 

453
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,550
in practice it's very challenging to
solve them in

454
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:00,560
solve them in
 

455
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,150
solve them in
in all but very simple cases uh

456
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:04,160
in all but very simple cases uh
 

457
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,390
in all but very simple cases uh
and then there's the other thing which

458
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:06,400
and then there's the other thing which
 

459
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,070
and then there's the other thing which
is that a lot of what we're interested

460
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:08,080
is that a lot of what we're interested
 

461
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:08,710
is that a lot of what we're interested
in

462
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:08,720
in

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,990

00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:12,000
is uh historically conditioned it's not
 

465
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,629
is uh historically conditioned it's not
uh it's not a matter of the fundamental

00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:14,639
uh it's not a matter of the fundamental
 

467
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,790
uh it's not a matter of the fundamental
equations but about

468
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:16,800
equations but about
 

469
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,830
equations but about
what has evolved or come out

470
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:19,840
what has evolved or come out
 

471
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,390
what has evolved or come out

things
and the laws of physic the basic laws of

and the laws of physic the basic laws of
 

479
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,990
and the laws of physic the basic laws of
physics only take you so far

480
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:30,000
physics only take you so far
 

481
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,909
physics only take you so far
in the in that it kind of provides a

00:08:31,909 --> 00:08:31,919
in the in that it kind of provides a
 

483
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,269
in the in that it kind of provides a
foundation but doesn't

484
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:33,279
foundation but doesn't
 

485
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,029
foundation but doesn't
really you need entirely different

486
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:35,039
really you need entirely different
 

487
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,870
really you need entirely different
concepts to deal with

488
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:36,880
concepts to deal with
 

489
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:42,149
concepts to deal with
uh those kind of uh and

490
00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:42,159

 

491
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,590

all we one thing i can say about that is

492
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:45,600
all we one thing i can say about that is
 

493
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,190
all we one thing i can say about that is
that the laws themselves

494
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:47,200
that the laws themselves
 

495
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,750
that the laws themselves
point out their limitations that they

496
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:49,760
point out their limitations that they
 

497
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,070
point out their limitations that they
kind of their laws for dynamical

498
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:52,080
kind of their laws for dynamical
 

499
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,949
kind of their laws for dynamical
evolution so they tell you what happens

500
00:08:54,949 --> 00:08:54,959
evolution so they tell you what happens
 

501
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,630
evolution so they tell you what happens
if you have a certain starting point but

502
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:56,640
if you have a certain starting point but
 

503
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,150
if you have a certain starting point but
they don't tell you what the starting

504
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:58,160
they don't tell you what the starting
 

505
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:58,870
they don't tell you what the starting
point

506

00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:37,279
can change
 

645
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,870
can change
the symbols and move them around in

00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:38,880
the symbols and move them around in
 

647
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,550
the symbols and move them around in
different ways and they still have

648
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:40,560
different ways and they still have
 

649
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,829
different ways and they still have
the same consequences uh

also turn out to be the concepts that
govern how the world actually works

676
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:17,920
in ways that are advantageous and to
 

677
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,110
in ways that are advantageous and to
learn from it

678
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:19,120
learn from it
 

679
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,509
learn from it
and so we are naturally evolved or

680
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:21,519
and so we are naturally evolved or
 

681
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,670
and so we are naturally evolved or
designed to enjoy beauty and

682
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:23,680
designed to enjoy beauty and
 

683
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,990
designed to enjoy beauty and
and it's a symmetry and this and the

684
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:26,000
and it's a symmetry and this and the
 

685
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,910
and it's a symmetry and this and the
world has it and that's no

686
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:27,920
world has it and that's no
 

687
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,310
world has it and that's no
that's why we that's why we resonate

688
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:30,320
that's why we that's why we resonate
 

689
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,990
that's why we that's why we resonate
with it well it's interesting that the

690
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:32,000
with it well it's interesting that the
 

691
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,829
with it well it's interesting that the
ideas of symmetry emerge at

692
00:12:33,829 --> 00:12:33,839
ideas of symmetry emerge at
 

693
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,190
ideas of symmetry emerge at
all at many levels of

694
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:37,200
all at many levels of
 

695
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,110
all at many levels of
the hierarchy of the universe so

696
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:41,120
the hierarchy of the universe so
 

697
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,190
the hierarchy of the universe so
you're talking about particles but it

698
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:43,200
you're talking about particles but it
 

699
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,310
you're talking about particles but it
also is

700
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:44,320
also is
 

701
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,190
also is
at the level of chemistry and biology

702
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:47,200
at the level of chemistry and biology
 

703
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,550
at the level of chemistry and biology
and

704
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:48,560
and
 

705
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,389
and
um and the fact that our

706
00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:52,399
um and the fact that our
 

707
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,509
um and the fact that our
cognitive sort of our perception system

708
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:55,519
cognitive sort of our perception system
 

709
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,949
cognitive sort of our perception system
and whatever our cognition is also finds

710
00:12:58,949 --> 00:12:58,959
and whatever our cognition is also finds
 

711
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,069
and whatever our cognition is also finds
it appealing or somehow our sense of

712
00:13:02,069 --> 00:13:02,079
it appealing or somehow our sense of
 

713
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,069
it appealing or somehow our sense of
what is beautiful is grounded in this

714
00:13:04,069 --> 00:13:04,079
what is beautiful is grounded in this
 

715
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:05,750
what is beautiful is grounded in this
idea of symmetry or the breaking of

716
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:05,760
idea of symmetry or the breaking of
 

717
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,710
idea of symmetry or the breaking of
symmetry

718
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:06,720
symmetry
 

719
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,150
symmetry
symmetry is at the core of our

720
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:08,160
symmetry is at the core of our
 

721
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,910
symmetry is at the core of our
conception of beauty whether it's the

722
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:09,920
conception of beauty whether it's the
 

723
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,670
conception of beauty whether it's the
breaking or the non-breaking of the

724
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:11,680
breaking or the non-breaking of the
 

725
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,870
breaking or the non-breaking of the
symmetry

726
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:12,880
symmetry
 

727
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,670
symmetry
it makes you wonder why

728
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:17,680
it makes you wonder why
 

729
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,509
it makes you wonder why
why like uh so i come from russia

730
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:21,519
why like uh so i come from russia
 

731
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,670
why like uh so i come from russia
in the in the question of dostoyevsky

732
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:23,680
in the in the question of dostoyevsky
 

733
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,550
in the in the question of dostoyevsky
he's

734
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:24,560
he's
 

735
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,550
he's
he has said that beauty will save the

736
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:26,560
he has said that beauty will save the
 

737
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,750
he has said that beauty will save the
world maybe

738
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:27,760
world maybe
 

739
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,430
world maybe
maybe as a physicist you can tell me

740
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:29,440
maybe as a physicist you can tell me
 

741
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,190
maybe as a physicist you can tell me
what do you think he meant by that

742
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:31,200
what do you think he meant by that
 

743
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,550
what do you think he meant by that
i don't i don't know if it saves the

744
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:32,560
i don't i don't know if it saves the
 

745
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,790
i don't i don't know if it saves the
world but it does turn out to be a

746
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:34,800
world but it does turn out to be a
 

747
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,550
world but it does turn out to be a
tremendous source of insight into the

tremendous source of insight into the

00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,350
tremendous source of insight into the

world
when we uh investigate kind of the

752
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:40,880
when we uh investigate kind of the
 

753
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,990
when we uh investigate kind of the
the most fundamental interactions things

754

the most fundamental interactions things
 

755
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,870
the most fundamental interactions things
that are

756
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:44,880
that are
 

757
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,189
that are
hard to access because they occur at

758
00:13:47,189 --> 00:13:47,199
hard to access because they occur at
 

759
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:50,069
hard to access because they occur at
very short distances between

763
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,230

special kinds of particles whose

769
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,790

we don't have much to go on from

00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:02,800
we don't have much to go on from
 

771
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,030
we don't have much to go on from
everyday life but so we have when we

772
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:05,040
everyday life but so we have when we
 

773
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:05,910
everyday life but so we have when we
guess what the

774
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:05,920
guess what the
 

775
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,670
guess what the
so we and then the experiments are

776
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:07,680
so we and then the experiments are
 

777
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,590
so we and then the experiments are
difficult to do so you can't

778
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:09,600
difficult to do so you can't
 

779
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,629
difficult to do so you can't
you can't really uh follow a very

780
00:14:12,629 --> 00:14:12,639
you can't really uh follow a very
 

781
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,750
you can't really uh follow a very
uh holy empirical procedure to

782
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:15,760
uh holy empirical procedure to
 

783
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,030
uh holy empirical procedure to
sort of step in the baconian style

784
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:19,040
sort of step in the baconian style
 

785
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,870
sort of step in the baconian style
figure out the laws kind of step by step

786
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:20,880
figure out the laws kind of step by step
 

787
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,030
figure out the laws kind of step by step
just by accumulating a lot of data

788
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:23,040
just by accumulating a lot of data
 

789
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,629
just by accumulating a lot of data
what we actually do is guess and the

790
00:14:26,629 --> 00:14:26,639
what we actually do is guess and the
 

791
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:27,189
what we actually do is guess and the
guesses

792
00:14:27,189 --> 00:14:27,199
guesses
 

793
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,670
guesses
are kind of aesthetic really what what

794
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:29,680
are kind of aesthetic really what what
 

795
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,350
are kind of aesthetic really what what
would be a nice description

796
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:31,360
would be a nice description
 

797
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,150
would be a nice description
that's consistent with what we know and

798
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:34,160
that's consistent with what we know and
 

799
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,150
that's consistent with what we know and
then you try it out and see if it works

800
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:36,160
then you try it out and see if it works
 

801
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:36,710
then you try it out and see if it works
and then

802
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:36,720
and then
 

803
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,910
and then
and by gosh it does in in some

804
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:39,920
and by gosh it does in in some
 

805
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,430
and by gosh it does in in some
in many profound cases uh so

806
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:43,440
in many profound cases uh so
 

807
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,350
in many profound cases uh so
there's that but there's another source

808
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:45,360
there's that but there's another source
 

809
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,189
there's that but there's another source
of symmetry which i didn't

810
00:14:47,189 --> 00:14:47,199
of symmetry which i didn't
 

811
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,710
of symmetry which i didn't
talk so much about in uh

812
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:50,720
talk so much about in uh
 

813
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,629
talk so much about in uh
in a beautiful question but does

814
00:14:54,629 --> 00:14:54,639
in a beautiful question but does
 

815
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,110
in a beautiful question but does
uh relate to your comments and i think

816
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:57,120
uh relate to your comments and i think
 

817
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,550
uh relate to your comments and i think
very much relates to

818
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:58,560
very much relates to
 

819
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,389
very much relates to
uh the source of symmetry that we find

820
00:15:02,389 --> 00:15:02,399
uh the source of symmetry that we find
 

821
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,509
uh the source of symmetry that we find
in biology

822
00:15:03,509 --> 00:15:03,519
in biology
 

823
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,710
in biology
and uh in

824
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:06,720
and uh in
 

825
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,550
and uh in
in our in our heads you know in our

826
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:08,560
in our in our heads you know in our
 

827
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,750
in our in our heads you know in our
brain

828
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:09,760
brain
 

829
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,110
brain
which is that uh although i'd

830
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:13,120
which is that uh although i'd
 

831
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,189
which is that uh although i'd
well it is discussed a bit in in a

832
00:15:17,189 --> 00:15:17,199
well it is discussed a bit in in a
 

833
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:18,550
well it is discussed a bit in in a
beautiful question and and

834
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:18,560
beautiful question and and
 

835
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,829
beautiful question and and
also in fundamentals is that

836
00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:21,839
also in fundamentals is that
 

837
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,509
also in fundamentals is that
when you have

838
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:25,519

 

839
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,470

symmetry is also a very important means

840
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:28,480
symmetry is also a very important means
 

841
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,230
symmetry is also a very important means
of construction

842
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:30,240
of construction
 

843
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,189
of construction
so when you have for instance simple

844
00:15:33,189 --> 00:15:33,199
so when you have for instance simple
 

845
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:34,470
so when you have for instance simple
viruses

846
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:34,480
viruses
 

847
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,590
viruses
that that need to construct their coat

848
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:37,600
that that need to construct their coat
 

849
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,389
that that need to construct their coat
their protein coat the coats often take

850
00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:40,399
their protein coat the coats often take
 

851
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,430
their protein coat the coats often take
the form of platonic solids

852
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:43,440
the form of platonic solids
 

853
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,990
the form of platonic solids
and the reason is that the viruses are

854
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:46,000
and the reason is that the viruses are
 

855
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,870
and the reason is that the viruses are
really dumb

856
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:46,880
really dumb
 

857
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,870
really dumb
and they only know how to do one thing

858
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:48,880
and they only know how to do one thing
 

859
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,550
and they only know how to do one thing
so they make a pentagon then they make

860
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:50,560
so they make a pentagon then they make
 

861
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,990
so they make a pentagon then they make
another pentagon and they make another

862
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:52,000
another pentagon and they make another
 

863
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,430
another pentagon and they make another
pentagon and they

864
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:53,440
pentagon and they
 

865
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,350
pentagon and they
all glue together in the same way and

866
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:55,360
all glue together in the same way and
 

867
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,749
all glue together in the same way and
that makes a very symmetrical

868
00:15:57,749 --> 00:15:57,759
that makes a very symmetrical
 

869
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,590
that makes a very symmetrical
object sort of so the rules of

870
00:15:59,590 --> 00:15:59,600
object sort of so the rules of
 

871
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,910
object sort of so the rules of
development when you have simple rules

872
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:01,920
development when you have simple rules
 

873
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,550
development when you have simple rules
and they

874
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:02,560
and they
 

875
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,749
and they
go they work again and again you get

876
00:16:05,749 --> 00:16:05,759
go they work again and again you get
 

877
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,829
go they work again and again you get
symmetrical patterns that's it's kind of

878
00:16:07,829 --> 00:16:07,839
symmetrical patterns that's it's kind of
 

879
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:09,749
symmetrical patterns that's it's kind of
in in fact it's a recipe also for

880
00:16:09,749 --> 00:16:09,759
in in fact it's a recipe also for
 

881
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:10,870
in in fact it's a recipe also for
generating

882
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:10,880
generating
 

883
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,710
generating
fractals you know really like uh

884
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:14,720
fractals you know really like uh
 

885
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,230
fractals you know really like uh
the kind of broccoli that has all this

886
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:18,240
the kind of broccoli that has all this
 

887
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,590
the kind of broccoli that has all this
internal structure and i

888
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:19,600
internal structure and i
 

889
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,350
internal structure and i
wish i had a picture to ship that many

890
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:21,360
wish i had a picture to ship that many
 

891
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,949

people remember it from the

892
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:22,959
people remember it from the
 

893
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:26,550
people remember it from the
from the uh uh from the supermarket

894
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:26,560
from the uh uh from the supermarket
 

895
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,870
from the uh uh from the supermarket
and then and you say how did a vegetable

896
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:28,880
and then and you say how did a vegetable
 

897
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,389
and then and you say how did a vegetable
get so intelligent to make such a

898
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:30,399
get so intelligent to make such a
 

899
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,230
get so intelligent to make such a
beautiful object of all this

900
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:32,240
beautiful object of all this
 

901
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,030
beautiful object of all this
fractal structure and the the the secret

902
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:35,040
fractal structure and the the the secret
 

903
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,110
fractal structure and the the the secret
is stupidity you just do the same thing

904
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:37,120
is stupidity you just do the same thing
 

905
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,470
is stupidity you just do the same thing
over and over again

906
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:38,480
over and over again
 

907
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,069
over and over again
and uh in our brains also you know we've

908
00:16:42,069 --> 00:16:42,079
and uh in our brains also you know we've
 

909
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:45,990
and uh in our brains also you know we've
we came out we start from single cells

910
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:46,000
we came out we start from single cells
 

911
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,949
we came out we start from single cells
and they reproduce and they they're each

912
00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:48,959
and they reproduce and they they're each
 

913
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:49,350
and they reproduce and they they're each
one

914
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:49,360
one
 

915
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,509
one
does basically roughly the same thing

916
00:16:51,509 --> 00:16:51,519
does basically roughly the same thing
 

917
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:52,550
does basically roughly the same thing
they

918
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:52,560
they
 

919
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,749
they
they uh the the program evolves in time

920
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:55,759
they uh the the program evolves in time
 

921
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:56,629
they uh the the program evolves in time
of course

922
00:16:56,629 --> 00:16:56,639
of course
 

923
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,310
of course
different different modules get turned

924
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:00,320
different different modules get turned
 

925
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,509
different different modules get turned
on and off genetic

926
00:17:01,509 --> 00:17:01,519
on and off genetic
 

927
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,269
on and off genetic
different regions of the genetic code

928
00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:03,279
different regions of the genetic code
 

929
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,710
different regions of the genetic code
get turned on and off

930
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:04,720
get turned on and off
 

931
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,750
get turned on and off
but uh but basically a lot of the same

932
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:07,760
but uh but basically a lot of the same
 

933
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,189
but uh but basically a lot of the same
things are going on and they're simple

934
00:17:09,189 --> 00:17:09,199
things are going on and they're simple
 

935
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,029
things are going on and they're simple
things and so you produce the same

936
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:11,039
things and so you produce the same
 

937
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,630
things and so you produce the same
patterns over and over again and that's

938
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:12,640
patterns over and over again and that's
 

939
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,470
patterns over and over again and that's
a recipe for producing symmetry because

940
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:14,480
a recipe for producing symmetry because
 

941
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,909
a recipe for producing symmetry because
you're getting the same thing

942
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:15,919
you're getting the same thing
 

943
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:19,909
you're getting the same thing
in many many places and if you look at

944
00:17:19,909 --> 00:17:19,919

 

945
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,189

for instance the beautiful drawings of

946
00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:23,199
for instance the beautiful drawings of
 

947
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,189
for instance the beautiful drawings of
rahman ikahal the great neuroanatomist

948
00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:27,199
rahman ikahal the great neuroanatomist
 

949
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,830
rahman ikahal the great neuroanatomist
who drew the structure of different

950
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:29,840
who drew the structure of different
 

951
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,470
who drew the structure of different
organs

952
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:30,480
organs
 

953
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,310
organs
like the hippocampus you see it's very

954
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:34,320
like the hippocampus you see it's very
 

955
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,510
like the hippocampus you see it's very
regular

956
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:35,520
regular
 

957
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,830
regular
and very intricate and

958
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:39,840
and very intricate and
 

959
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,190
and very intricate and
it's symmetry in in this in

960
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:43,200
it's symmetry in in this in
 

961
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,870
it's symmetry in in this in
in that sense it's because it's it's

962
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:44,880
in that sense it's because it's it's
 

963
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,350
in that sense it's because it's it's
it's many repeated units that that

964
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:47,360
it's many repeated units that that
 

965
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,190
it's many repeated units that that
uh you can take from one place to the

966
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:49,200
uh you can take from one place to the
 

967
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,470
uh you can take from one place to the
other and see that they look more or

968
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:50,480
other and see that they look more or
 

969
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,750
other and see that they look more or
less the same

970
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:51,760
less the same
 

971
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,830
less the same
but what you're describing this kind of

972
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:53,840
but what you're describing this kind of
 

973

people read it
 

991
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:18,310

you uh you say that space and time are
 

993
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,029
you uh you say that space and time are
pretty big

994

of space and time it's easy to
tell a brief history but the details get

00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:31,120
tell a brief history but the details get
 

1007
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:31,909
tell a brief history but the details get
very

1008
00:18:31,909 --> 00:18:31,919
very
 

1009
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,310
very
involved of course but uh one thing i'd

1010
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:34,320
involved of course but uh one thing i'd
 

1011
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,150
involved of course but uh one thing i'd
like to say is that

1012
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:36,160
like to say is that
 

1013
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,310
like to say is that
if if if you take a broad enough view

1014
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:38,320
if if if you take a broad enough view
 

1015
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,909
if if if you take a broad enough view
the history of the universe is simpler

1016
00:18:39,909 --> 00:18:39,919
the history of the universe is simpler
 

1017
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,870
the history of the universe is simpler
than the history of sweden say

1018
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:42,880
than the history of sweden say
 

1019
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,549
than the history of sweden say
because you don't you your standards are

1020
00:18:44,549 --> 00:18:44,559
because you don't you your standards are
 

1021
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,870
because you don't you your standards are
lower for for

1022
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:46,880
lower for for
 

1023
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,990
lower for for
but just to make it a a a

1024
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:50,000
but just to make it a a a
 

1025
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,590
but just to make it a a a
quantitative i'll just give a few

1026
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:51,600
quantitative i'll just give a few
 

1027
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,510
quantitative i'll just give a few
highlights and it's it's

1028
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:53,520
highlights and it's it's
 

1029
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,150
highlights and it's it's
it's a little bit easier to talk about

1030
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:56,160
it's a little bit easier to talk about
 

1031
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:56,870
it's a little bit easier to talk about
time

1032
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:56,880
time
 

1033
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,070
time
uh so let's start with that the big bang

1034
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:00,080
uh so let's start with that the big bang
 

1035
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:00,950
uh so let's start with that the big bang
occurred

1036
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:00,960
occurred
 

1037
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,510
occurred
we think the universe was much hotter

1038
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:03,520
we think the universe was much hotter
 

1039
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,669
we think the universe was much hotter
and denser and more uniform

1040
00:19:05,669 --> 00:19:05,679
and denser and more uniform
 

1041
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,110
and denser and more uniform
about 13.8 billion years ago and that's

1042
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:09,120
about 13.8 billion years ago and that's
 

1043
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:09,990
about 13.8 billion years ago and that's
what we call the big

1044
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:10,000
what we call the big
 

1045
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,310
what we call the big
bang and it's been expanding and cooling

1046
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:14,320
bang and it's been expanding and cooling
 

1047
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,909
bang and it's been expanding and cooling
the matter in it has been expanding and

1048
00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:15,919
the matter in it has been expanding and
 

1049
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:16,710
the matter in it has been expanding and
cooling

1050
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:16,720
cooling
 

1051
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,590
cooling
ever since so in a real sense the

1052
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:19,600
ever since so in a real sense the
 

1053
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,470
ever since so in a real sense the
universe is 13.8 billion years old

1054
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:22,480
universe is 13.8 billion years old
 

1055
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,950
universe is 13.8 billion years old
that's a big number kind of hard to

1056
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:24,960
that's a big number kind of hard to
 

1057
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,070
that's a big number kind of hard to
think about

1058
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:26,080
think about
 

1059
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,630
think about
a a nice way to think about it though is

1060
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:28,640
a a nice way to think about it though is
 

1061
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,270
a a nice way to think about it though is
to map

1062
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:29,280
to map
 

1063
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,390
to map
it on to one year so if

1064
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:32,400
it on to one year so if
 

1065
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,630
it on to one year so if
so let's say the universe just linearly

1066
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:34,640
so let's say the universe just linearly
 

1067
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,190
so let's say the universe just linearly
map the time intervals from

1068
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:37,200
map the time intervals from
 

1069
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,230
map the time intervals from
13.8 billion years on to one year so

1070
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:40,240
13.8 billion years on to one year so
 

1071
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,029
13.8 billion years on to one year so
the the big bang then is that on january

1072
00:19:43,029 --> 00:19:43,039
the the big bang then is that on january
 

1073
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:43,990
the the big bang then is that on january
1st at

1074
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:44,000
1st at
 

1075
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,350
1st at
12 a.m and

1076
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:47,360
12 a.m and
 

1077
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:52,150
12 a.m and
uh you wait for quite a long time

1078
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:52,160
uh you wait for quite a long time
 

1079
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,830
uh you wait for quite a long time
before the dinosaur has emerged the

1080
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:53,840
before the dinosaur has emerged the
 

1081
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,070
before the dinosaur has emerged the
dinosaurs emerge on christmas

1082
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:56,080
dinosaurs emerge on christmas
 

1083
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:00,070
dinosaurs emerge on christmas
it turns out almost 12 months later

1084
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:00,080
it turns out almost 12 months later
 

1085
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,510
it turns out almost 12 months later
getting close to the end yes

1086
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:03,520
getting close to the end yes
 

1087
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,710
getting close to the end yes
and the extinction event that uh

1088
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:06,720
and the extinction event that uh
 

1089
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,070
and the extinction event that uh
let mammals and ultimately humans

1090
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:10,080
let mammals and ultimately humans
 

1091
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,110
let mammals and ultimately humans
inherit the earth from from the

1092
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:13,120
inherit the earth from from the
 

1093
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,549
inherit the earth from from the
dinosaurs occurred on december 30th

1094
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:16,559
dinosaurs occurred on december 30th
 

1095
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:19,190
dinosaurs occurred on december 30th
and all of human history is a small part

1096
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:19,200
and all of human history is a small part
 

1097
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,789
and all of human history is a small part
of the last day

1098
00:20:20,789 --> 00:20:20,799
of the last day
 

1099
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:24,230
of the last day
and so so yes so we

1100
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:24,240
and so so yes so we
 

1101
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,110
and so so yes so we
we're occupying only a human lifetime is

1102
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:27,120
we're occupying only a human lifetime is
 

1103
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:27,350
we're occupying only a human lifetime is
a

1104
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:27,360
a
 

1105
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,750
a
very very infinitesimal part of this uh

1106
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:31,760
very very infinitesimal part of this uh
 

1107
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,950
very very infinitesimal part of this uh
interval of these gigantic cosmic

1108
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:34,960
interval of these gigantic cosmic
 

1109
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,549
interval of these gigantic cosmic
reaches of time uh and

1110
00:20:38,549 --> 00:20:38,559
reaches of time uh and
 

1111
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:41,270
reaches of time uh and
in space we can tell a very similar

1112
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:41,280
in space we can tell a very similar
 

1113
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,630
in space we can tell a very similar
story in fact

1114
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:42,640
story in fact
 

1115
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,669
story in fact
a very uh it's convenient to think

1116
00:20:45,669 --> 00:20:45,679
a very uh it's convenient to think
 

1117
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:48,789
a very uh it's convenient to think
that the size of the universe is

1118
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:48,799
that the size of the universe is
 

1119
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,950
that the size of the universe is
the distance that light can travel in

1120
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:50,960
the distance that light can travel in
 

1121
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,950
the distance that light can travel in
13.8 billion years that's

1122
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:52,960
13.8 billion years that's
 

1123
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,470
13.8 billion years that's
so it's 13.8 billion light years

1124
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:56,480
so it's 13.8 billion light years
 

1125
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,950
so it's 13.8 billion light years
that's that's how far you can see out

1126
00:20:58,950 --> 00:20:58,960
that's that's how far you can see out
 

1127
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,990
that's that's how far you can see out
that's how far

1128
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:00,000
that's how far
 

1129
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,590
that's how far
things can signals can reach us from

1130
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:03,600
things can signals can reach us from
 

1131
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,870
things can signals can reach us from
and um that

1132
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:06,880
and um that
 

1133
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,070
and um that
is a big distance

1134
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:10,080
is a big distance
 

1135
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,710
is a big distance
because compared to that uh the the

1136
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:12,720
because compared to that uh the the
 

1137
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,510
because compared to that uh the the
universe

1138
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:13,520
universe
 

1139
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,710
universe
that the earth is a fraction of a light

1140
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:16,720
that the earth is a fraction of a light
 

1141
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,070
that the earth is a fraction of a light
second

1142
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:18,080
second
 

1143
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,430
second
so again we it's really really big

1144
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:21,440
so again we it's really really big
 

1145
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,190
so again we it's really really big
and so we have if we want to think about

1146
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:25,200
and so we have if we want to think about
 

1147
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,830
and so we have if we want to think about
the universe as a whole in space and

1148
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:28,840
the universe as a whole in space and
 

1149
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,310
the universe as a whole in space and
time

1150
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:30,320
time
 

1151
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,990
time
we really need a different kind of

1152
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:34,000
we really need a different kind of
 

1153
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:34,950
we really need a different kind of
imagination

1154
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:34,960
imagination
 

1155
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:41,110
imagination
it's not it's not something you can

1156
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:41,120

 

1157
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,590

grasp in terms of psychological time in

1158
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:43,600
grasp in terms of psychological time in
 

1159
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,029
grasp in terms of psychological time in
a useful way you have to think

1160
00:21:45,029 --> 00:21:45,039
a useful way you have to think
 

1161
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,630
a useful way you have to think
you know you have to use exponential

1162
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:46,640
you know you have to use exponential
 

1163
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,110
you know you have to use exponential
notation and abstract concepts

1164
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:49,120
notation and abstract concepts
 

1165
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,230
notation and abstract concepts
to really get any uh hold on on

1166
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:52,240
to really get any uh hold on on
 

1167
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,149
to really get any uh hold on on

i try to estimate how many thoughts a

kind of a fuzzy question but i'm very

kind of a fuzzy question but i'm very
 

1199
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:35,990
kind of a fuzzy question but i'm very
proud that i

1200
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:36,000
proud that i
 

1201
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,430
proud that i

but that's true but uh you know there's
 

1249

how did you um do that calculate can you

how did you um do that calculate can you
 

1253
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:31,510
how did you um do that calculate can you
maybe break that apart a little bit just

00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:31,520
maybe break that apart a little bit just

00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:53,520
something that
 

1331
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,750
something that
that is matched to our processing speed

1332
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:55,760
that is matched to our processing speed
 

1333
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,549
that is matched to our processing speed
versus

1334
00:24:56,549 --> 00:24:56,559
versus
 

1335
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:59,029
versus
too fast and and it turns out about 40

1336
00:24:59,029 --> 00:24:59,039
too fast and and it turns out about 40
 

1337
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,390
too fast and and it turns out about 40
per second

1338
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:00,400
per second
 

1339
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,430
per second
and then if you take 40 per second as

1340
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:03,440
and then if you take 40 per second as
 

1341
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,830
and then if you take 40 per second as
as how well we how fast we can process

1342
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:05,840
as how well we how fast we can process
 

1343
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,430
as how well we how fast we can process
visual images you get

1344
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:07,440
visual images you get
 

1345
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,710
visual images you get
to several billions of thoughts uh

1346
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:10,720
to several billions of thoughts uh
 

1347
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,070
to several billions of thoughts uh
if you similarly if you ask what

1348
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:14,080
if you similarly if you ask what
 

1349
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,070
if you similarly if you ask what
what are some of the fastest things that

1350
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:16,080
what are some of the fastest things that
 

1351
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,750
what are some of the fastest things that
people can do well you can they can play

1352
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:17,760
people can do well you can they can play
 

1353
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,990
people can do well you can they can play
video games they can play the piano very

1354
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:20,000
video games they can play the piano very
 

1355
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,870
video games they can play the piano very
fast if

1356
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:20,880
fast if
 

1357
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,029
fast if
if they're skilled at it and again you

1358
00:25:23,029 --> 00:25:23,039
if they're skilled at it and again you
 

1359
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:24,470
if they're skilled at it and again you
get to similar

00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:24,480
get to similar
 

1361
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,269
get to similar
uh units or how fast can people talk you

1362
00:25:27,269 --> 00:25:27,279
uh units or how fast can people talk you
 

1363
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:28,070
uh units or how fast can people talk you
get to sim

1364
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:28,080
get to sim
 

1365
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,350
get to sim
you know within a couple of orders of

1366
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:29,360
you know within a couple of orders of
 

1367
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,190
you know within a couple of orders of
magnitude you get more or less to the

1368
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:31,200
magnitude you get more or less to the
 

1369
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:31,909
magnitude you get more or less to the
same

1370
00:25:31,909 --> 00:25:31,919
same
 

1371
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:35,190
same
idea so uh so that's how

1372
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:35,200
idea so uh so that's how
 

1373
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,990
idea so uh so that's how
you can say that that there's there's

1374
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:38,000
you can say that that there's there's
 

1375
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,870
you can say that that there's there's
billions of

1376
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:38,880
billions of
 

1377
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,710
billions of
meaning there's room for billions of

1378
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:40,720
meaning there's room for billions of
 

1379
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,990
meaning there's room for billions of
meaningful thoughts

1380
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:42,000
meaningful thoughts
 

1381
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,669
meaningful thoughts
yeah i won't argue for exactly 2 billion

1382
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:45,679
yeah i won't argue for exactly 2 billion
 

1383
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:48,470
yeah i won't argue for exactly 2 billion
versus 1.8 billion it's not that kind of

1384
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:48,480
versus 1.8 billion it's not that kind of
 

1385
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,190
versus 1.8 billion it's not that kind of
question but

1386
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:49,200
question but
 

1387
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,070
question but
but i think any estimate that's

1388
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:52,080
but i think any estimate that's
 

1389
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,710
but i think any estimate that's
reasonable will come out

1390
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:54,720
reasonable will come out
 

1391
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,269
reasonable will come out
within say a hundred billion and a

1392
00:25:57,269 --> 00:25:57,279
within say a hundred billion and a
 

1393
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:58,070
within say a hundred billion and a
hundred million

1394
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:58,080
hundred million
 

1395
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,820
hundred million
so it's a lot

1396
00:25:59,820 --> 00:25:59,830
so it's a lot
 

1397
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,510
so it's a lot
[Laughter]

1398
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:01,520
[Laughter]
 

1399
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,070
[Laughter]
it would be interesting to map out for

1400
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:04,080
it would be interesting to map out for
 

1401
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,669
it would be interesting to map out for
an individual human being

1402
00:26:05,669 --> 00:26:05,679
an individual human being
 

1403
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:08,310
an individual human being
the landscape of thoughts that they've

1404
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:08,320
the landscape of thoughts that they've
 

1405
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,710
the landscape of thoughts that they've
sort of traveled if you think of

1406
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:10,720
sort of traveled if you think of
 

1407
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,230
sort of traveled if you think of
thoughts as a set of trajectories uh

1408
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:14,240
thoughts as a set of trajectories uh
 

1409
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,310
thoughts as a set of trajectories uh
what what that landscape looks like i

1410
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:16,320
what what that landscape looks like i
 

1411
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,070
what what that landscape looks like i
mean

1412
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:18,080
mean
 

1413
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,909
mean
i've been recently really thinking about

1414
00:26:19,909 --> 00:26:19,919
i've been recently really thinking about
 

1415
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:21,590
i've been recently really thinking about
uh

1416
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:21,600
uh
 

1417
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,630
uh
this richard dawkins idea of memes

1418
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:24,640
this richard dawkins idea of memes
 

1419
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,630
this richard dawkins idea of memes
and just all these ideas and the

1420
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:26,640
and just all these ideas and the
 

1421
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,390
and just all these ideas and the
evolution of ideas inside of one

1422
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:28,400
evolution of ideas inside of one
 

1423
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,630
evolution of ideas inside of one
particular human mind

1424
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:30,640
particular human mind
 

1425
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,950
particular human mind
and how there's there then changed and

1426
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:32,960
and how there's there then changed and
 

1427
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,909
and how there's there then changed and
evolved by

1428
00:26:33,909 --> 00:26:33,919
evolved by
 

1429
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,549
evolved by
interaction with other human beings it's

1430
00:26:36,549 --> 00:26:36,559
interaction with other human beings it's
 

1431
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:37,990
interaction with other human beings it's
interesting to think about

1432
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:38,000
interesting to think about
 

1433
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,350
interesting to think about
so if you think the numbers billions

1434
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:41,360
so if you think the numbers billions
 

1435
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,590
so if you think the numbers billions
you you think there's also social

1436
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:43,600
you you think there's also social
 

1437
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,590
you you think there's also social
interaction so these aren't

1438
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:45,600
interaction so these aren't
 

1439
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,950
interaction so these aren't
uh like there's interaction in the same

1440
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:48,960
uh like there's interaction in the same
 

1441
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,510
uh like there's interaction in the same
way you have

1442
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:49,520
way you have
 

1443
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,870
way you have
interaction with particles there's

1444
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:50,880
interaction with particles there's
 

1445
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,110
interaction with particles there's
interaction between human thoughts

1446
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:53,120
interaction between human thoughts
 

1447
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,269
interaction between human thoughts
uh that are perhaps that's that

1448
00:26:55,269 --> 00:26:55,279
uh that are perhaps that's that
 

1449
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,190
uh that are perhaps that's that
interaction in itself is fundamental to

1450
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:57,200
interaction in itself is fundamental to
 

1451
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,390
interaction in itself is fundamental to
the process

1452
00:26:58,390 --> 00:26:58,400
the process
 

1453
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,149
the process
of thinking like without social

1454
00:27:00,149 --> 00:27:00,159
of thinking like without social
 

1455
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:01,909
of thinking like without social
interaction we would be

1456
00:27:01,909 --> 00:27:01,919
interaction we would be
 

1457
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,230
interaction we would be
like stuck like walking in a circle we

1458
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:04,240
like stuck like walking in a circle we
 

1459
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,110
like stuck like walking in a circle we
need

1460
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:05,120
need
 

1461
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,269
need
we need the perturbation of other humans

1462
00:27:07,269 --> 00:27:07,279
we need the perturbation of other humans
 

1463
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:08,230
we need the perturbation of other humans
to create

1464
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:08,240
to create
 

1465
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,549

change in evolution once you bring in
 

1467
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,230

1468
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:12,240
concepts of uh
 

1469
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,630
concepts of uh
interactions and correlations and

relations
 

1473
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,510
relations
then you have what's called a

1474
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:17,520
then you have what's called a
 

1475
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,230
then you have what's called a
combinatorial explosion

1476
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:20,240
combinatorial explosion
 

1477
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,870
combinatorial explosion
that the number of possibilities rap

1478
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:22,880
that the number of possibilities rap
 

1479
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,029

00:27:25,029 --> 00:27:25,039
expands exponentially technically with

00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:26,470
expands exponentially technically with

and
uh it can easily rapidly outstrip these

1488
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:33,760
uh it can easily rapidly outstrip these
 

1489
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,430
uh it can easily rapidly outstrip these

uh can i ask you about the big bang uh

1588
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:19,840
uh can i ask you about the big bang uh
 

1589
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,070
uh can i ask you about the big bang uh
so we talked about the space and time

1590
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:22,080
so we talked about the space and time
 

1591
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,230
so we talked about the space and time
are really big

1592
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:24,240
are really big
 

1593
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,350
are really big
but then and we humans give a lot of

1594
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:27,360
but then and we humans give a lot of
 

1595
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,789
but then and we humans give a lot of
meaning to the word space

1596
00:29:28,789 --> 00:29:28,799
meaning to the word space
 

1597
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:33,590
meaning to the word space
and time in our in our like daily lives

1598
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:33,600
and time in our in our like daily lives
 

1599
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,470
and time in our in our like daily lives
but then can we talk about this moment

1600
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:36,480
but then can we talk about this moment
 

1601
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,190
but then can we talk about this moment
of beginning

1602
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:37,200
of beginning
 

1603
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,310
of beginning
and how we're supposed to think about it

1604
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:40,320
and how we're supposed to think about it
 

1605
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,310
and how we're supposed to think about it
that at the moment the big bang

1606
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:42,320
that at the moment the big bang
 

1607
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,990
that at the moment the big bang
everything was uh

1608
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:44,000
everything was uh
 

1609
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,870
everything was uh
what like infinitely small and then it

1610
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:46,880
what like infinitely small and then it
 

1611
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,510
what like infinitely small and then it
just

1612
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:47,520
just
 

1613
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,669
just
blew up we have to be careful here

1614
00:29:49,669 --> 00:29:49,679
blew up we have to be careful here
 

1615
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:50,710
blew up we have to be careful here
because there's a

1616
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:50,720
because there's a
 

1617
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,070
because there's a
there's a common misconception that

1618
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:54,080
there's a common misconception that
 

1619
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,190
there's a common misconception that
the big that the big bang is like the

1620
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:57,200
the big that the big bang is like the
 

1621
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,430
the big that the big bang is like the

00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,470
you know all of that stuff
like really hot really really

1662
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:48,480
like really hot really really
 

1663
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,350
like really hot really really
really hot we're talking about uh way

1664
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:51,360
really hot we're talking about uh way
 

1665
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,909
really hot we're talking about uh way
way hotter than the surface of the sun

1666
00:30:53,909 --> 00:30:53,919
way hotter than the surface of the sun
 

1667
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:57,350
way hotter than the surface of the sun
uh you know well in fact if you

1668
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:57,360
uh you know well in fact if you
 

1669
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,470
uh you know well in fact if you
take the equations as we as they come

1670
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:00,480
take the equations as we as they come
 

1671
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,230
take the equations as we as they come
the the prediction is that the

1672
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:02,240
the the prediction is that the
 

1673
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,990
the the prediction is that the
temperature just goes to infinity but

1674
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:04,000
temperature just goes to infinity but
 

1675
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,590
temperature just goes to infinity but
then the equations

1676
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:05,600
then the equations
 

1677
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,830
then the equations
uh break down we don't you know we don't

1678
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:07,840
uh break down we don't you know we don't
 

1679
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,110
uh break down we don't you know we don't
don't really

1680
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:09,120
don't really

00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,509
don't really
with their various the equations become

with their various the equations become
 

1683
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:13,269
with their various the equations become
infinity equals infinity so they don't

1684
00:31:13,269 --> 00:31:13,279
infinity equals infinity so they don't

really know uh this is running the

00:31:18,549 --> 00:31:18,559
really know uh this is running the
 

1691
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,230
really know uh this is running the
equations backwards so you can't really

equations backwards so you can't really
 

1693
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,190

get a sensible

get a sensible
 

1695
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,789

we need different equations to address

or even the moment before the big bang
 

1799
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:23,110

can we understand what happened before

can we understand what happened before
 

1801
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,549

the big bang i'm

the big bang i'm
 

1803
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:27,830
the big bang i'm
i'm optimistic both that we'll

1804
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:27,840
i'm optimistic both that we'll
 

1805
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,509
i'm optimistic both that we'll
be able to uh measure more

00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:31,519
be able to uh measure more
 

1807
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:34,630
be able to uh measure more
so observe more and that we'll be able

1808
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:34,640
so observe more and that we'll be able
 

1809
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,630
so observe more and that we'll be able
to figure out more

1810
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:36,640
to figure out more
 

1811
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,110
to figure out more
so uh they're very very tangible

1812
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:39,120
so uh they're very very tangible

very small to the very large and all in
 

1991
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,589
very small to the very large and all in
the service of

1992
00:36:47,589 --> 00:36:47,599
the service of
 

1993
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:50,630
the service of
uh curiosity and built on a grand scale

1994
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:50,640
uh curiosity and built on a grand scale
 

1995
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:57,430
uh curiosity and built on a grand scale
so yeah

1996
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:57,440

 

1997
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,790

if we did that i love that you're

1998
00:36:58,790 --> 00:36:58,800
if we did that i love that you're
 

1999
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,190
if we did that i love that you're
inspired both by by the power of theory

2000
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:01,200
inspired both by by the power of theory
 

2001
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,950
inspired both by by the power of theory
and the power of experiments so this is

2002
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:02,960
and the power of experiments so this is
 

2003
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,470
and the power of experiments so this is
the both both i think are

2004
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:06,480
the both both i think are
 

2005
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,230
the both both i think are
exceptionally impressive that the human

2006
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:08,240
exceptionally impressive that the human
 

2007
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,390
exceptionally impressive that the human
mind can come up with theories

2008
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:10,400
mind can come up with theories
 

2009
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,310
mind can come up with theories
that give us a peek into how the

2010
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:12,320
that give us a peek into how the
 

2011
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,069
that give us a peek into how the
universe works but also

2012
00:37:14,069 --> 00:37:14,079
universe works but also
 

2013
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:17,109
universe works but also
construct tools that are way bigger than

2014
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:17,119
construct tools that are way bigger than
 

2015
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:17,910
construct tools that are way bigger than
uh

2016
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:17,920
uh
 

2017
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,150
uh
the the evolutionary origins we came

2018
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:20,160
the the evolutionary origins we came
 

2019
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:20,950
the the evolutionary origins we came
from right

2020
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:20,960
from right
 

2021
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,550
from right
and by the way you know the fact that we

2022
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:22,560
and by the way you know the fact that we
 

2023
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,190
and by the way you know the fact that we
can design those things and they work

2024
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:25,200
can design those things and they work
 

2025
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,990
can design those things and they work
yeah is an extraordinary demonstration

2026
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:28,000
yeah is an extraordinary demonstration
 

2027
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,030
yeah is an extraordinary demonstration
that we really do

2028
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:29,040
that we really do
 

2029
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,069
that we really do
understand a lot and then

2030
00:37:32,069 --> 00:37:32,079
understand a lot and then
 

2031
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:34,950
understand a lot and then
in some ways and it's our ability to

2032
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:34,960
in some ways and it's our ability to
 

2033
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:35,430
in some ways and it's our ability to
answer

2034
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:35,440
answer
 

2035
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,670
answer
questions that also leads us to be able

2036
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:37,680
questions that also leads us to be able
 

2037
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,670
questions that also leads us to be able
to address more ambitious questions

2038
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:39,680
to address more ambitious questions
 

2039
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,390
to address more ambitious questions
so you mentioned that at the at the big

2040
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:42,400
so you mentioned that at the at the big
 

2041
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:42,870
so you mentioned that at the at the big
bang

2042
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:42,880
bang
 

2043
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,510
bang
in the early days things are pretty

2044
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:45,520
in the early days things are pretty
 

2045
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,790
in the early days things are pretty
homogeneous

2046
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:46,800
homogeneous
 

2047
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:51,589
homogeneous
yes but uh here we are sitting on earth

2048
00:37:51,589 --> 00:37:51,599
yes but uh here we are sitting on earth
 

2049
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:55,030
yes but uh here we are sitting on earth
to uh hairless apes you could say

2050
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:55,040
to uh hairless apes you could say
 

2051
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,589
to uh hairless apes you could say
with microphones in talking about the

2052
00:37:57,589 --> 00:37:57,599
with microphones in talking about the
 

2053
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:59,190
with microphones in talking about the
brief history of things you said it's

2054
00:37:59,190 --> 00:37:59,200
brief history of things you said it's
 

2055
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,030
brief history of things you said it's
much harder to describe sweden than it

2056
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:01,040
much harder to describe sweden than it
 

2057
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:01,270
much harder to describe sweden than it
is

2058
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:01,280
is
 

2059
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,310
is
um the universe so there's a lot of

2060
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:04,320
um the universe so there's a lot of
 

2061
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,190
um the universe so there's a lot of
complexity

2062
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:05,200
complexity
 

2063
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,109
complexity
there's a lot of interesting details

2064
00:38:07,109 --> 00:38:07,119
there's a lot of interesting details
 

2065
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:09,750
there's a lot of interesting details
here so how does this complexity come to

2066
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:09,760
here so how does this complexity come to
 

2067
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,870
here so how does this complexity come to
be do you think

2068
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:10,880
be do you think
 

2069
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,589
be do you think
it seems like there's these pockets yeah

2070
00:38:13,589 --> 00:38:13,599
it seems like there's these pockets yeah
 

2071
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:15,990
it seems like there's these pockets yeah
we don't know how rare of like

2072
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:16,000
we don't know how rare of like
 

2073
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,510
we don't know how rare of like
uh we're hairless apes just emerge yeah

2074
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:19,520
uh we're hairless apes just emerge yeah
 

2075
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,910
uh we're hairless apes just emerge yeah
and then they came from the initial soup

2076
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:21,920
and then they came from the initial soup
 

2077
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,349
and then they came from the initial soup
that was homogeneous

2078
00:38:23,349 --> 00:38:23,359
that was homogeneous
 

2079
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:26,390
that was homogeneous
was that uh yeah accident

2080
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:26,400
was that uh yeah accident
 

2081
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,030
was that uh yeah accident
well we understand there we understand

2082
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:29,040
well we understand there we understand

00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,470
well we understand there we understand

we certainly don't understand why it

2088
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:35,280
we certainly don't understand why it
 

2089
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,589
we certainly don't understand why it
happened exactly and the way it did or

00:38:37,589 --> 00:38:37,599
happened exactly and the way it did or
 

2091
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:41,030
happened exactly and the way it did or
but but uh or you know

2092
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:41,040
but but uh or you know
 

2093
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,710
but but uh or you know
there are certainly open questions about

2094
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:42,720
there are certainly open questions about
 

2095
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,190
there are certainly open questions about
the origins of life and how inevitable

2096
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:45,200
the origins of life and how inevitable
 

2097

00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,790
the emergence of intelligence was and
and how that happened

2100
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:48,800
and how that happened
 

2101
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,390
and how that happened
but uh in the very broadest terms

2102
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:52,400
but uh in the very broadest terms
 

2103
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,670
but uh in the very broadest terms
uh the universe early on

2104
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:55,680
uh the universe early on
 

2105
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,950
uh the universe early on
was quite homogeneous but not completely

2106
00:38:58,950 --> 00:38:58,960
was quite homogeneous but not completely

00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:17,510
uh as time goes on
there's an instability which causes

00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:17,520
there's an instability which causes
 

2119
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,190
there's an instability which causes
those density contrasts

2120
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:19,200
those density contrasts
 

2121
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,109
those density contrasts
to increase there's a gravitational

2122
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:21,119
to increase there's a gravitational
 

2123
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:22,950
to increase there's a gravitational
instability where it's denser

2124
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:22,960
instability where it's denser
 

2125
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,630
instability where it's denser
the gravitational attractions are

2126
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:24,640
the gravitational attractions are
 

2127
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,790
the gravitational attractions are
stronger and so that brings in more

2128
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:26,800
stronger and so that brings in more
 

2129
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,470
stronger and so that brings in more
matter and it gets even denser

2130
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:28,480
matter and it gets even denser
 

2131
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,430
matter and it gets even denser
and so on and so on so so there's a

2132
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:31,440
and so on and so on so so there's a
 

2133
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,310
and so on and so on so so there's a
natural

2134
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:32,320
natural
 

2135
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,870
natural
tendency of matter to clump because of

2136
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:34,880
tendency of matter to clump because of
 

2137
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,109
tendency of matter to clump because of
gravitational interactions

2138
00:39:37,109 --> 00:39:37,119
gravitational interactions
 

2139
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:39,990
gravitational interactions
and then the equations get complicated

2140
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:40,000
and then the equations get complicated
 

2141
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,670
and then the equations get complicated
when you have lots of things

2142
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:41,680
when you have lots of things
 

2143
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:45,190
when you have lots of things
clumping together uh then you know then

2144
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:45,200
clumping together uh then you know then
 

2145
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,190
clumping together uh then you know then
then we know what the laws are but we

2146
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:47,200
then we know what the laws are but we
 

2147
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,430
then we know what the laws are but we
have to to a certain extent wave our

2148
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:49,440
have to to a certain extent wave our
 

2149
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,950
have to to a certain extent wave our
hands about what what

2150
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:50,960
hands about what what
 

2151
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,470
hands about what what
what happens but uh the basic

2152
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:54,480
what happens but uh the basic
 

2153
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,870
what happens but uh the basic
understanding of chemistry says that if

2154
00:39:56,870 --> 00:39:56,880
understanding of chemistry says that if
 

2155
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,829
understanding of chemistry says that if
things

2156
00:39:57,829 --> 00:39:57,839
things
 

2157
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:00,310
things
and and the physics of radiation tells

2158
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:00,320
and and the physics of radiation tells
 

2159
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,109
and and the physics of radiation tells
us that if

2160
00:40:01,109 --> 00:40:01,119
us that if
 

2161
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:02,870
us that if
as things start to clump together they

2162
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:02,880
as things start to clump together they
 

2163
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,950
as things start to clump together they
can radiate give off some

2164
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:04,960
can radiate give off some
 

2165
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,430
can radiate give off some
energy so they don't just they slow down

2166
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:07,440
energy so they don't just they slow down
 

2167
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,270
energy so they don't just they slow down
they as a result they lose energy they

2168
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:09,280
they as a result they lose energy they
 

2169
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,950
they as a result they lose energy they
conglomerate together

2170
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:10,960
conglomerate together
 

2171
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,230
conglomerate together
cool down form things like stars form

2172
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:14,240
cool down form things like stars form
 

2173
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,150
cool down form things like stars form
things like planets

2174
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:16,160
things like planets
 

2175
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:19,109
things like planets
and so in broad terms there's no mystery

2176
00:40:19,109 --> 00:40:19,119
and so in broad terms there's no mystery
 

2177
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:20,069
and so in broad terms there's no mystery
there's

2178
00:40:20,069 --> 00:40:20,079
there's
 

2179
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:22,390
there's
that that's what the scenario that's

2180
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:22,400
that that's what the scenario that's
 

2181
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,990
that that's what the scenario that's
what the equations tell

2182
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:24,000
what the equations tell
 

2183
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,270
what the equations tell
you should happen but because

2184
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:27,280
you should happen but because
 

2185
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:31,589
you should happen but because
it's a process involving many many

2186
00:40:31,589 --> 00:40:31,599
it's a process involving many many
 

2187
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:36,309
it's a process involving many many
fundament individual units uh

2188
00:40:36,309 --> 00:40:36,319

sensitivity to initial conditions which

2204
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:55,280

00:40:58,790 --> 00:40:58,800
tiny differences in the initial state
 

2209
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,550
tiny differences in the initial state
can lead to enormous differences

2210
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:00,560
can lead to enormous differences
 

2211
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:04,829
can lead to enormous differences
in the subsequent behavior so so

00:41:15,349 --> 00:41:15,359
and and uh and then
 

2223
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:19,030
and and uh and then
again in broad terms we know how

2224
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:19,040
again in broad terms we know how
 

2225
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:22,390
again in broad terms we know how
uh it's conceivable that that the

2226
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:22,400
uh it's conceivable that that the
 

2227
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,190
uh it's conceivable that that the
humans and things like that can can uh

2228
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:25,200
humans and things like that can can uh
 

2229
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,069
humans and things like that can can uh
that how complex structure can emerge

2230
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:28,079
that how complex structure can emerge
 

2231
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:32,230
that how complex structure can emerge
it's a matter of uh having

2232
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:32,240
it's a matter of uh having
 

2233
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,150
it's a matter of uh having
the right kind of temperature and the

2234
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:34,160
the right kind of temperature and the
 

2235
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,150
the right kind of temperature and the
right kind of stuff

2236
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:36,160
right kind of stuff
 

2237
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:40,230
right kind of stuff
so you need you need to be able to make

2238
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:40,240
so you need you need to be able to make
 

2239
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,990
so you need you need to be able to make
chemical bonds that are reasonably

2240
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:42,000
chemical bonds that are reasonably
 

2241
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,349
chemical bonds that are reasonably
stable and

2242
00:41:43,349 --> 00:41:43,359
stable and
 

2243
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:45,829
stable and
be able to make complex structures and

2244
00:41:45,829 --> 00:41:45,839
be able to make complex structures and
 

2245
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:47,750
be able to make complex structures and
we're very fortunate that carbon has

2246
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:47,760
we're very fortunate that carbon has
 

2247
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:47,990
we're very fortunate that carbon has
this

2248
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:48,000
this
 

2249
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,069
this
ability to make uh backbones and

2250
00:41:52,069 --> 00:41:52,079
ability to make uh backbones and
 

2251
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:54,309
ability to make uh backbones and
elaborate branchings and things so you

2252
00:41:54,309 --> 00:41:54,319
elaborate branchings and things so you
 

2253
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:55,910
elaborate branchings and things so you
can get complex things that we call

2254
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:55,920
can get complex things that we call
 

2255
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,510
can get complex things that we call
biochemistry

2256
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:57,520
biochemistry
 

2257
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,470
biochemistry
and and yet the bonds can be broken a

2258
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:00,480
and and yet the bonds can be broken a
 

2259
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,309
and and yet the bonds can be broken a
little bit with the help of

2260
00:42:02,309 --> 00:42:02,319
little bit with the help of
 

2261
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:04,870
little bit with the help of
energetic injections from the sun so you

2262
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:04,880
energetic injections from the sun so you
 

2263
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:05,589
energetic injections from the sun so you
have to have

2264
00:42:05,589 --> 00:42:05,599
have to have
 

2265
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:07,430
have to have
both the possibility of changing but

2266
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:07,440
both the possibility of changing but
 

2267
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,630
both the possibility of changing but
also the possible

2268
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:08,640
also the possible
 

2269
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,109
also the possible
useful degree of stability and we know

2270
00:42:11,109 --> 00:42:11,119
useful degree of stability and we know
 

2271
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:12,230
useful degree of stability and we know
at that

2272
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:12,240
at that
 

2273
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:15,270
at that
very very broad level

2274
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:15,280
very very broad level

00:42:16,309 --> 00:42:16,319
physics can tell you that it's
 

2277
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:18,550

2278
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:18,560
conceivable yeah if you want to know
 

2279
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,829
conceivable yeah if you want to know
what actually

2280
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:19,839
what actually
 

2281
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:22,950
what actually
what what's what what really happened

2282
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:22,960
what what's what what really happened
 

2283
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,270
what what's what what really happened
what really can happen then you have to

2284
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:25,280
what really can happen then you have to
 

2285
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,069
what really can happen then you have to
work a bit to

2286
00:42:26,069 --> 00:42:26,079
work a bit to
 

2287
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:27,750
work a bit to
go to chemistry if you have if you want

2288
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:27,760
go to chemistry if you have if you want
 

2289
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,670
go to chemistry if you have if you want
to know what actually happened

2290
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:29,680
to know what actually happened
 

2291
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,270
to know what actually happened
then you really have to consult the

2292
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:31,280
then you really have to consult the
 

2293
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,910
then you really have to consult the
fossil record in biologists and so

2294
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:33,920
fossil record in biologists and so
 

2295
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:37,270
fossil record in biologists and so
so uh but but it's it so these

2296
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:37,280
so uh but but it's it so these
 

2297
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:41,109
so uh but but it's it so these
these ways of addressing the issue

2298
00:42:41,109 --> 00:42:41,119
these ways of addressing the issue
 

2299
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:43,190
these ways of addressing the issue
are complementary in a sense they but

2300
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:43,200
are complementary in a sense they but
 

2301
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,190
are complementary in a sense they but
they uh

00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:45,200
they uh
 

2303
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:48,870

kinds of questions but

2310
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:54,560
kinds of questions but
 

2311
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,710
kinds of questions but
they're they're not inconsistent they're

just
 

2315
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,910
just
complimentary it's kind of interesting

2316
00:42:59,910 --> 00:42:59,920
complimentary it's kind of interesting
 

2317
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:00,870
complimentary it's kind of interesting
to think about

2319
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:04,950
to think about
those early fluctuations as our

those early fluctuations as our
 

2321
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:08,230
those early fluctuations as our
earliest ancestors yes that's right so

2322
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:08,240
earliest ancestors yes that's right so
 

2323
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,710
earliest ancestors yes that's right so
it's far it's amazing to think that uh

2324
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:10,720
it's far it's amazing to think that uh
 

2325
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:14,550
it's far it's amazing to think that uh
you know this is

you know this is
 

2327
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:18,710
you know this is
the modern answer to the uh

2328
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:18,720
the modern answer to the uh
 

2329
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,750
the modern answer to the uh
or the modern version of uh

2330
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:21,760
or the modern version of uh

as old as the earth itself in the sense

that once the earth

00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:56,150
that once the earth
became reason was was returned from a

off into a solid mass with

00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,430
off into a solid mass with
it with water uh life emerged very very

2412
00:45:03,430 --> 00:45:03,440
it with water uh life emerged very very
 

2413
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:04,309
it with water uh life emerged very very
quickly so

2414
00:45:04,309 --> 00:45:04,319
quickly so
 

2415
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:05,750
quickly so
so it seems that these general

2416
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:05,760
so it seems that these general
 

2417
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,069
so it seems that these general
conditions for life

2418

conditions for life
 

2419
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:11,910
conditions for life
uh are enough to to make it happen

2420
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:11,920
uh are enough to to make it happen
 

2421
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:15,910
uh are enough to to make it happen
uh relatively quickly now

uh relatively quickly now

00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,589
uh relatively quickly now
the other lesson i would i think that

00:45:19,589 --> 00:45:19,599
the other lesson i would i think that
 

2425
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:22,390
the other lesson i would i think that
one can uh draw from this one example

one can uh draw from this one example
 

2427
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,510

it's dangerous to

it's dangerous to
 

2429
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,670
it's dangerous to
the drug lessons from one example but

the drug lessons from one example but
 

2431
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:26,790
the drug lessons from one example but
that's all we've got

2432
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:26,800
that's all we've got
 

2433
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:30,790
that's all we've got
uh and uh that that the emergence of

uh and uh that that the emergence of

00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,710
uh and uh that that the emergence of
intelligent life is a different

intelligent life is a different

00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:36,390
they they were at best bird brains
because you know birds

2482
00:46:36,390 --> 00:46:36,400
because you know birds
 

2483
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,510
because you know birds
came from the dinosaurs uh and

2484
00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:39,520
came from the dinosaurs uh and
 

2485
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,349
came from the dinosaurs uh and
uh and it could have stayed that way you

2486
00:46:41,349 --> 00:46:41,359
uh and it could have stayed that way you
 

2487
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:42,710
uh and it could have stayed that way you
know and and

2488
00:46:42,710 --> 00:46:42,720
know and and
 

2489
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,870
know and and
then human and the emergence of humans

2490
00:46:44,870 --> 00:46:44,880
then human and the emergence of humans
 

2491
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,670
then human and the emergence of humans
was very contingent and kind of a

2492
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:47,680
was very contingent and kind of a
 

2493
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,589
was very contingent and kind of a
very very recent development on

2494
00:46:49,589 --> 00:46:49,599
very very recent development on
 

2495
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,750
very very recent development on
evolutionary time scales

2496
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:51,760
evolutionary time scales
 

2497
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,990
evolutionary time scales
and uh you can argue about the level of

2498
00:46:53,990 --> 00:46:54,000
and uh you can argue about the level of
 

2499
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,670
and uh you can argue about the level of
human intelligence but it's you know i

2500
00:46:55,670 --> 00:46:55,680
human intelligence but it's you know i
 

2501
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:56,230
human intelligence but it's you know i
think it's

2502
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:56,240
think it's
 

2503
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,309
think it's
that that's what we're talking about and

2504
00:46:58,309 --> 00:46:58,319
that that's what we're talking about and
 

2505
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:00,870
that that's what we're talking about and
it's very it's very impressive and can

2506
00:47:00,870 --> 00:47:00,880
it's very it's very impressive and can
 

2507
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,710
it's very it's very impressive and can
ask these kinds of questions and discuss

2508
00:47:02,710 --> 00:47:02,720
ask these kinds of questions and discuss
 

2509
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,150
ask these kinds of questions and discuss
them intelligently

2510
00:47:04,150 --> 00:47:04,160
them intelligently
 

2511
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:07,829
them intelligently
uh the uh so

2512
00:47:07,829 --> 00:47:07,839
uh the uh so
 

2513
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:11,270
uh the uh so
i guess my my so this is a long-winded

2514
00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:11,280
i guess my my so this is a long-winded
 

2515
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:16,069
i guess my my so this is a long-winded
answer or justification of

2516
00:47:16,069 --> 00:47:16,079
answer or justification of
 

2517
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:19,589
answer or justification of
my feeling is that uh the

2518
00:47:19,589 --> 00:47:19,599
my feeling is that uh the
 

2519
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:22,710
my feeling is that uh the
conditions for life

2520
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:22,720
conditions for life
 

2521
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:26,950
conditions for life
in some form are probably con

2522
00:47:26,950 --> 00:47:26,960
in some form are probably con
 

2523
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,870
in some form are probably con

even and even within our galaxy uh
 

2529
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:34,870
even and even within our galaxy uh
i'm not so sure about the emergence of

2530
00:47:34,870 --> 00:47:34,880
i'm not so sure about the emergence of
 

2531
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,870
i'm not so sure about the emergence of
intelligent life

2532
00:47:36,870 --> 00:47:36,880
intelligent life
 

2533
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:40,230
intelligent life
or the emergence of technological uh

2534
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:40,240
or the emergence of technological uh
 

2535
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:44,069
or the emergence of technological uh
civilizations that that that seems

2536
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:44,079
civilizations that that that seems
 

2537
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:46,790
civilizations that that that seems
uh much more much more contingent and

2538
00:47:46,790 --> 00:47:46,800
uh much more much more contingent and
 

2539
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,150
uh much more much more contingent and
special and

2540
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:48,160
special and
 

2541
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,390
special and
we might it's conceivable to me that

2542
00:47:50,390 --> 00:47:50,400
we might it's conceivable to me that
 

2543
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,670
we might it's conceivable to me that
we're the only example

2544
00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:51,680
we're the only example
 

2545

we're the only example

yeah i don't know one way or the other i

00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:56,720
yeah i don't know one way or the other i
 

2549
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,790
yeah i don't know one way or the other i
i have different opinions on different

00:47:58,790 --> 00:47:58,800
i have different opinions on different

i have different opinions on different
days of the week well one of the things

2552
00:48:00,230 --> 00:48:00,240
days of the week well one of the things
 

2553
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,270
days of the week well one of the things
that worries me

2554
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:01,280
that worries me
 

2555
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:04,630
that worries me
in in uh in the spirit of being humble

2556
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:04,640
in in uh in the spirit of being humble
 

2557
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:08,950
in in uh in the spirit of being humble
that our particular kind of intelligence

2558
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:08,960
that our particular kind of intelligence
 

2559
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,750
that our particular kind of intelligence
is not very special so there's all kinds

2560
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:11,760
is not very special so there's all kinds
 

2561
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,589
is not very special so there's all kinds
of different intelligences

2562
00:48:13,589 --> 00:48:13,599
of different intelligences
 

2563
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:16,309
of different intelligences
and even more broadly there could be

2564
00:48:16,309 --> 00:48:16,319
and even more broadly there could be
 

2565
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:17,510
and even more broadly there could be
many different

2566
00:48:17,510 --> 00:48:17,520
many different
 

2567
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:20,309
many different
kinds of life yes so the basic

2568
00:48:20,309 --> 00:48:20,319
kinds of life yes so the basic
 

2569
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:22,230
kinds of life yes so the basic
definition and i just had

2570
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:22,240
definition and i just had
 

2571
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,390
definition and i just had
i think somebody that you know sarah

2572
00:48:24,390 --> 00:48:24,400
i think somebody that you know sarah
 

2573
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:25,750
i think somebody that you know sarah
walker i just had a very long

2574
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:25,760
walker i just had a very long
 

2575
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,109
walker i just had a very long
conversation with her

2576
00:48:27,109 --> 00:48:27,119
conversation with her
 

2577
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:29,190
conversation with her
about even just the very basic question

2578
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:29,200
about even just the very basic question
 

2579
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,790
about even just the very basic question
of trying to define

2580
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:30,800
of trying to define
 

2581
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,990
of trying to define
what is life from a physics perspective

2582
00:48:33,990 --> 00:48:34,000
what is life from a physics perspective
 

2583
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,990
what is life from a physics perspective
yeah even that question within itself i

2584
00:48:35,990 --> 00:48:36,000
yeah even that question within itself i
 

2585
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,430
yeah even that question within itself i
think one of the most fundamental

2586
00:48:37,430 --> 00:48:37,440
think one of the most fundamental
 

2587
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:38,069
think one of the most fundamental
questions

2588
00:48:38,069 --> 00:48:38,079
questions
 

2589
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:41,190
questions
in science and physics and everything is

2590
00:48:41,190 --> 00:48:41,200
in science and physics and everything is
 

2591
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:41,510
in science and physics and everything is
just

2592
00:48:41,510 --> 00:48:41,520
just
 

2593
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:44,390
just
trying to get a hold trying to get some

2594
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:44,400
trying to get a hold trying to get some
 

2595
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,069
trying to get a hold trying to get some
universal laws around the

2596
00:48:46,069 --> 00:48:46,079
universal laws around the
 

2597
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:47,990
universal laws around the
ideas of what is life because that kind

2598
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:48,000
ideas of what is life because that kind
 

2599
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,309
ideas of what is life because that kind
of unlocks a bunch of things around

2600
00:48:50,309 --> 00:48:50,319
of unlocks a bunch of things around
 

2601
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:52,470
of unlocks a bunch of things around
life intelligence consciousness all

2602
00:48:52,470 --> 00:48:52,480
life intelligence consciousness all
 

2603
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:53,349
life intelligence consciousness all
those kinds of things

2604
00:48:53,349 --> 00:48:53,359
those kinds of things
 

2605
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:55,190
those kinds of things
i agree with you in a sense but i think

2606
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:55,200
i agree with you in a sense but i think
 

2607
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:58,069
i agree with you in a sense but i think
that's a dangerous question because

2608
00:48:58,069 --> 00:48:58,079
that's a dangerous question because
 

2609
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:01,510
that's a dangerous question because
the the answer can't be any more precise

2610
00:49:01,510 --> 00:49:01,520
the the answer can't be any more precise
 

2611
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:02,790
the the answer can't be any more precise
than the question

2612
00:49:02,790 --> 00:49:02,800
than the question
 

2613
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:07,829
than the question
and the uh the the question what is life

2614
00:49:07,829 --> 00:49:07,839

 

2615
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:09,990

kind of assumes that we have a

2616
00:49:09,990 --> 00:49:10,000
kind of assumes that we have a
 

2617
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,750
kind of assumes that we have a
definition of life and that it's a

2618
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:11,760
definition of life and that it's a
 

2619
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,589
definition of life and that it's a
natural phenomena that that can be

2620
00:49:13,589 --> 00:49:13,599
natural phenomena that that can be
 

2621
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:14,470
natural phenomena that that can be
distinguished

2622
00:49:14,470 --> 00:49:14,480
distinguished
 

2623
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:16,390
distinguished
but that really there are edge cases

2624
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:16,400
but that really there are edge cases
 

2625
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,150
but that really there are edge cases
like viruses and

2626
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:18,160
like viruses and
 

2627
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:21,589
like viruses and
uh some people would like to say that uh

2628
00:49:21,589 --> 00:49:21,599
uh some people would like to say that uh
 

2629
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:24,390
uh some people would like to say that uh
electrons have consciousness and they

2630
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:24,400
electrons have consciousness and they
 

2631
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:24,870
electrons have consciousness and they
you know

2632
00:49:24,870 --> 00:49:24,880
you know
 

2633
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,750
you know
so you can't if you really have fuzzy

2634
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:27,760
so you can't if you really have fuzzy
 

2635
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:28,549
so you can't if you really have fuzzy
concepts

2636
00:49:28,549 --> 00:49:28,559
concepts
 

2637
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:31,030
concepts
it's uh it's very hard to to reach

2638
00:49:31,030 --> 00:49:31,040
it's uh it's very hard to to reach
 

2639
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:33,990
it's uh it's very hard to to reach
precise kinds of scientific answers

2640
00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:34,000
precise kinds of scientific answers
 

2641
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,390
precise kinds of scientific answers
but i think there's a very fruitful

2642
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:36,400
but i think there's a very fruitful
 

2643
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,270
but i think there's a very fruitful
question that's

2647
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:41,990
adjacent to it which is has been pursued
in different forms

2651
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:47,750
for quite a while and is now becoming
very sophisticated

very sophisticated
 

2653
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:50,150
very sophisticated
in reaching in new directions and that

00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:50,160
in reaching in new directions and that
 

2655
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:50,950
in reaching in new directions and that
is

2656
00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:50,960
is
 

2657
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:54,069
is
what are the states of matter that are

2658
00:49:54,069 --> 00:49:54,079
what are the states of matter that are
 

2659
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:55,349
what are the states of matter that are
possible you know so

2660
00:49:55,349 --> 00:49:55,359
possible you know so
 

2661
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:58,710
possible you know so
in high school or grade school you

2662
00:49:58,710 --> 00:49:58,720
in high school or grade school you
 

2663
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,790
in high school or grade school you
learn about solid solids liquids and

2664
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:00,800
learn about solid solids liquids and
 

2665
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,510
learn about solid solids liquids and
gases but that really just scratches the

2666
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:03,520
gases but that really just scratches the
 

2667
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:04,549
gases but that really just scratches the

00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:13,400
form into uh
 

2675
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:15,589

00:50:15,589 --> 00:50:15,599
macroscopically different meaningful
 

2677
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:17,270
macroscopically different meaningful
patterns that we call phases

2678
00:50:17,270 --> 00:50:17,280
patterns that we call phases
 

2679
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,190
patterns that we call phases
and then there are precise definitions

2680
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:19,200
and then there are precise definitions
 

2681
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,190
and then there are precise definitions
of what we mean by phases of matter

2682
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:21,200
of what we mean by phases of matter
 

2683
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,190
of what we mean by phases of matter
but then uh and that have been worked

2684
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:23,200
but then uh and that have been worked
 

2685
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,470
but then uh and that have been worked
out fruitful

2686
00:50:24,470 --> 00:50:24,480
out fruitful
 

2687
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:27,750
out fruitful
over the decades and we're discovering

00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:27,760
over the decades and we're discovering
 

2689
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,670

new states of matter all the time
 

2691
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:31,670
new states of matter all the time
and kind of having to work at what we

2692
00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:31,680
and kind of having to work at what we
 

2693

and uh
 

2703
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:45,910
and uh
some of them like liquid crystals

00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:45,920
some of them like liquid crystals
 

2705
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:49,030
some of them like liquid crystals
are important ingredients of life our

00:50:49,030 --> 00:50:49,040
are important ingredients of life our
 

2707
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,589
are important ingredients of life our
cell membranes are liquid crystals

2708
00:50:51,589 --> 00:50:51,599
cell membranes are liquid crystals
 

2709
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:52,870
cell membranes are liquid crystals
and that's very important to the way

2710
00:50:52,870 --> 00:50:52,880
and that's very important to the way
 

2711
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:55,430
and that's very important to the way
they work

2712

they work
 

2713
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:57,510
they work
recently there's been a development in

2714
00:50:57,510 --> 00:50:57,520
recently there's been a development in
 

2715
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,430
recently there's been a development in
where we're talking about

2716
00:50:59,430 --> 00:50:59,440
where we're talking about
 

2717
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:02,870
where we're talking about
uh states of matter that not only

2718
00:51:02,870 --> 00:51:02,880
uh states of matter that not only
 

2719
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:05,829
uh states of matter that not only
not that are not static but that have

2720
00:51:05,829 --> 00:51:05,839
not that are not static but that have
 

2721
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:08,230
not that are not static but that have
dynamics that have that uh

2722
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:08,240
dynamics that have that uh
 

2723
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:09,829
dynamics that have that uh
have characteristic patterns not only in

2724
00:51:09,829 --> 00:51:09,839
have characteristic patterns not only in
 

2725
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:11,349
have characteristic patterns not only in
space but in time

2726
00:51:11,349 --> 00:51:11,359
space but in time
 

2727
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:12,870
space but in time
these are called time crystals and

2728
00:51:12,870 --> 00:51:12,880
these are called time crystals and
 

2729
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:15,270
these are called time crystals and
that's that's been a development that's

2730
00:51:15,270 --> 00:51:15,280
that's that's been a development that's
 

2731
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,750
that's that's been a development that's
just in the last decade or so it's

2732
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:17,760
just in the last decade or so it's
 

2733
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:18,309
just in the last decade or so it's
really

2734
00:51:18,309 --> 00:51:18,319
really
 

2735
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:21,670
really
really flourishing uh and

2736
00:51:21,670 --> 00:51:21,680
really flourishing uh and
 

2737
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:25,910
really flourishing uh and
so uh is there a state of matter that

2738
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:25,920
so uh is there a state of matter that
 

2739
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:26,710
so uh is there a state of matter that
cause or

2740
00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:26,720
cause or
 

2741
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:27,990
cause or
group of states of matter that

2742
00:51:27,990 --> 00:51:28,000
group of states of matter that
 

2743
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,829
group of states of matter that
corresponds to life

2744
00:51:29,829 --> 00:51:29,839
corresponds to life
 

2745
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:33,750
corresponds to life
uh maybe but but the answer can't be any

2746
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:33,760
uh maybe but but the answer can't be any
 

2747
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,510
uh maybe but but the answer can't be any
more definite than the question

2748
00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:35,520
more definite than the question
 

2749
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,750
more definite than the question
so i mean i i got to push back on the

2750
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:37,760
so i mean i i got to push back on the
 

2751
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:38,630
so i mean i i got to push back on the
the the quite

2752
00:51:38,630 --> 00:51:38,640
the the quite
 

2753
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:41,030
the the quite
those are just words i mean i i i

2754
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:41,040
those are just words i mean i i i
 

2755
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:42,630
those are just words i mean i i i
disagree with you the

2756
00:51:42,630 --> 00:51:42,640
disagree with you the
 

2757
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:45,829
disagree with you the
the the question points to a direction

2758
00:51:45,829 --> 00:51:45,839
the the question points to a direction
 

2759
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:47,910
the the question points to a direction
the answer might be able to be to be

2760
00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:47,920
the answer might be able to be to be
 

2761
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:50,309
the answer might be able to be to be
more precise than the question

2762
00:51:50,309 --> 00:51:50,319
more precise than the question
 

2763
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:53,190
more precise than the question
because because uh just as you're saying

2764
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:53,200
because because uh just as you're saying
 

2765
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:53,670
because because uh just as you're saying
there

2766
00:51:53,670 --> 00:51:53,680
there
 

2767
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:56,630
there
there's uh that we could be discovering

2768
00:51:56,630 --> 00:51:56,640
there's uh that we could be discovering
 

2769
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:57,589
there's uh that we could be discovering
certain

2770
00:51:57,589 --> 00:51:57,599
certain
 

2771
00:51:57,599 --> 00:51:59,910
certain
characteristics and patterns that are

00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:08,630
type of matter macroscopically speaking
and that that we can then uh be able to

2778
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:08,640
and that that we can then uh be able to
 

2779
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:11,750
and that that we can then uh be able to
post facto say this is let's

2780
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:11,760
post facto say this is let's
 

2781
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,470
post facto say this is let's
sign the word life well kind of matter i

2782
00:52:14,470 --> 00:52:14,480
sign the word life well kind of matter i
 

2783
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,150
sign the word life well kind of matter i
agree with that completely that that's

2784
00:52:16,150 --> 00:52:16,160
agree with that completely that that's
 

2785
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:18,870
agree with that completely that that's
that's uh but that's so it's not a

2786
00:52:18,870 --> 00:52:18,880
that's uh but that's so it's not a
 

2787
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:19,670
that's uh but that's so it's not a
disagreement

2788
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:19,680
disagreement
 

2789
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:22,470
disagreement
it's very frequent in physics that where

2790
00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:22,480
it's very frequent in physics that where
 

2791
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:23,750
it's very frequent in physics that where
in science that

in science that
 

2793
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:27,190
in science that
uh words that are in common use gets

2794
00:52:27,190 --> 00:52:27,200
uh words that are in common use gets
 

2795
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:30,150
uh words that are in common use gets
get refined and reprocessed into

2796
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:30,160
get refined and reprocessed into
 

2797
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,910
get refined and reprocessed into
scientific terms that's happened for

00:52:31,910 --> 00:52:31,920
scientific terms that's happened for
 

2799
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,270
scientific terms that's happened for
things like force and

00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:36,390
things like force and
energy uh and

energy uh and
 

2803
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,710
energy uh and
so we've in a way we we find out what

2804
00:52:38,710 --> 00:52:38,720
so we've in a way we we find out what
 

2805
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:40,230
so we've in a way we we find out what
the useful definition

2806
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:40,240
the useful definition
 

2807
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:43,829
the useful definition

00:52:43,829 --> 00:52:43,839
is uh or symmetry for instance
 

2809
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:46,710
is uh or symmetry for instance
and the common usage may be quite

2810
00:52:46,710 --> 00:52:46,720
and the common usage may be quite
 

2811
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,390
and the common usage may be quite
different from the scientific usage but

2812
00:52:48,390 --> 00:52:48,400
different from the scientific usage but
 

2813
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,470
different from the scientific usage but
the scientific usage

2814
00:52:50,470 --> 00:52:50,480
the scientific usage
 

2815
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:52,950
the scientific usage
is special and takes on a life of its

2816
00:52:52,950 --> 00:52:52,960
is special and takes on a life of its
 

2817
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,470
is special and takes on a life of its
own and we find out what the

2818
00:52:54,470 --> 00:52:54,480
own and we find out what the
 

2819
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:57,910
own and we find out what the
the useful version of it is

2820
00:52:57,910 --> 00:52:57,920
the useful version of it is
 

2821
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:01,430
the useful version of it is
uh what the the fruitful version of it

2822
00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:01,440
uh what the the fruitful version of it
 

2823
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:01,910
uh what the the fruitful version of it
is

2824
00:53:01,910 --> 00:53:01,920
is
 

2825
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:05,190
is
so i do think so in that spirit

2826
00:53:05,190 --> 00:53:05,200
so i do think so in that spirit
 

2827
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:08,549
so i do think so in that spirit
i think if we uh can

2828
00:53:08,549 --> 00:53:08,559
i think if we uh can
 

2829
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:12,470
i think if we uh can
identify states of matter

2830
00:53:12,470 --> 00:53:12,480
identify states of matter
 

2831
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:15,910
identify states of matter
that or linked states of matter

2832
00:53:15,910 --> 00:53:15,920
that or linked states of matter
 

2833
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:19,710
that or linked states of matter
that can carry on processes of uh

2834
00:53:19,710 --> 00:53:19,720
that can carry on processes of uh
 

2835
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:22,950
that can carry on processes of uh
self-reproduction and development

2836
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:22,960
self-reproduction and development
 

2837
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:28,069
self-reproduction and development
and information processing

2838
00:53:28,069 --> 00:53:28,079
and information processing
 

2839
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:30,630
and information processing
we should say we we might be tempted to

2840
00:53:30,630 --> 00:53:30,640
we should say we we might be tempted to
 

2841
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:31,990
we should say we we might be tempted to
classify those

2842
00:53:31,990 --> 00:53:32,000
classify those
 

2843
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,549
classify those
as like things as life yeah well can i

2844
00:53:34,549 --> 00:53:34,559
as like things as life yeah well can i
 

2845
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:36,790
as like things as life yeah well can i
ask you about the craziest one

2846
00:53:36,790 --> 00:53:36,800
ask you about the craziest one
 

2847
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:40,390
ask you about the craziest one
which is uh the one we know

2848
00:53:40,390 --> 00:53:40,400
which is uh the one we know
 

2849
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,549
which is uh the one we know
maybe least about which is consciousness

2850
00:53:42,549 --> 00:53:42,559
maybe least about which is consciousness
 

2851
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:44,069
maybe least about which is consciousness
is it possible that there are certain

2852
00:53:44,069 --> 00:53:44,079
is it possible that there are certain
 

2853
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:45,510
is it possible that there are certain
kinds of matter would be able to

2854
00:53:45,510 --> 00:53:45,520
kinds of matter would be able to
 

2855
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:47,510
kinds of matter would be able to
classify

2856
00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:47,520
classify
 

2857
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:51,190
classify
as um conscious meaning

2858
00:53:51,190 --> 00:53:51,200
as um conscious meaning
 

2859
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,910
as um conscious meaning
like the so there's uh the pan cyclists

2860
00:53:53,910 --> 00:53:53,920
like the so there's uh the pan cyclists
 

2861
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:56,470
like the so there's uh the pan cyclists
right with the philosophers who kind of

2862
00:53:56,470 --> 00:53:56,480
right with the philosophers who kind of
 

2863
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:59,990
right with the philosophers who kind of
try to imply that uh all matter has some

2864
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:00,000
try to imply that uh all matter has some
 

2865
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,670
try to imply that uh all matter has some
degree of consciousness and yeah you can

2866
00:54:01,670 --> 00:54:01,680
degree of consciousness and yeah you can
 

2867
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,109
degree of consciousness and yeah you can
almost construct like a physics of

2868
00:54:03,109 --> 00:54:03,119
almost construct like a physics of
 

2869
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:03,990
almost construct like a physics of
consciousness

2870
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:04,000
consciousness
 

2871
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,109
consciousness
yes do you um

2872
00:54:07,109 --> 00:54:07,119
yes do you um
 

2873
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:09,109
yes do you um
again we're in such early days of this

2874
00:54:09,109 --> 00:54:09,119
again we're in such early days of this
 

2875
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:11,670
again we're in such early days of this
but nevertheless it seems useful to talk

2876
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:11,680
but nevertheless it seems useful to talk
 

2877
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:12,950
but nevertheless it seems useful to talk
about is

2878
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:12,960
about is
 

2879
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,190
about is
is there some sense from a physical

2880
00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:15,200
is there some sense from a physical
 

2881
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,470
is there some sense from a physical
perspective to make sense of

2882
00:54:16,470 --> 00:54:16,480
perspective to make sense of
 

2883
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:19,430
perspective to make sense of
consciousness

2884
00:54:19,430 --> 00:54:19,440

 

2885
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:22,470

again consciousness is uh

2886
00:54:22,470 --> 00:54:22,480
again consciousness is uh
 

2887
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:24,870
again consciousness is uh
imprecise a very imprecise word and

2888
00:54:24,870 --> 00:54:24,880
imprecise a very imprecise word and
 

2889
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:25,910
imprecise a very imprecise word and
loaded with

2890
00:54:25,910 --> 00:54:25,920
loaded with
 

2891
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:28,470
loaded with
uh connotations that i think we should

2892
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:28,480
uh connotations that i think we should
 

2893
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:29,030
uh connotations that i think we should
we

2894
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:29,040
we
 

2895
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,549
we
don't want to start a scientific

2896
00:54:30,549 --> 00:54:30,559
don't want to start a scientific
 

2897
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:32,870
don't want to start a scientific
analysis with that i don't think

2898
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:32,880
analysis with that i don't think
 

2899
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:36,789
analysis with that i don't think
uh it's often been

2900
00:54:36,789 --> 00:54:36,799
uh it's often been
 

2901
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:39,030
uh it's often been
important in science to start with

2902
00:54:39,030 --> 00:54:39,040
important in science to start with
 

2903
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,470
important in science to start with
simple cases

2904
00:54:40,470 --> 00:54:40,480
simple cases
 

2905
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:44,230
simple cases
and work up uh consciousness i think

2906
00:54:44,230 --> 00:54:44,240
and work up uh consciousness i think
 

2907
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:44,630
and work up uh consciousness i think
what

2908
00:54:44,630 --> 00:54:44,640
what
 

2909
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,630
what
most people think of when you talk about

2910
00:54:46,630 --> 00:54:46,640
most people think of when you talk about
 

2911
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:49,030
most people think of when you talk about
consciousness is okay

2912
00:54:49,030 --> 00:54:49,040
consciousness is okay
 

2913
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:52,789
consciousness is okay
i'm what am i doing in the in the world

2914
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:52,799
i'm what am i doing in the in the world
 

2915
00:54:52,799 --> 00:54:54,230
i'm what am i doing in the in the world
this is my experience i have a rich

2916
00:54:54,230 --> 00:54:54,240
this is my experience i have a rich
 

2917
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:55,829
this is my experience i have a rich
experience rich inner life and

2918
00:54:55,829 --> 00:54:55,839
experience rich inner life and
 

2919
00:54:55,839 --> 00:54:57,109
experience rich inner life and
experience of

2920
00:54:57,109 --> 00:54:57,119
experience of
 

2921
00:54:57,119 --> 00:54:59,750
experience of
and uh where is that in the equations

2922
00:54:59,750 --> 00:54:59,760
and uh where is that in the equations
 

2923
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:00,549
and uh where is that in the equations
and

2924
00:55:00,549 --> 00:55:00,559
and
 

2925
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:02,549
and
i think that's a great question a great

2926
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:02,559
i think that's a great question a great
 

2927
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:05,190
i think that's a great question a great
great question and actually i think

2928
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:05,200
great question and actually i think
 

2929
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,750
great question and actually i think
i'm gearing up to spend part of the i

2930
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:07,760
i'm gearing up to spend part of the i
 

2931
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:08,549
i'm gearing up to spend part of the i
mean

2932
00:55:08,549 --> 00:55:08,559
mean
 

2933
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:10,870
mean
to try to address that in coming years

2934
00:55:10,870 --> 00:55:10,880
to try to address that in coming years
 

2935
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,710
to try to address that in coming years
one version of asking that question just

2936
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:12,720
one version of asking that question just
 

2937
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,309
one version of asking that question just
as you said now

2938
00:55:14,309 --> 00:55:14,319
as you said now
 

2939
00:55:14,319 --> 00:55:17,109
as you said now
is what is the simplest yeah formulation

2940
00:55:17,109 --> 00:55:17,119
is what is the simplest yeah formulation
 

2941
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:17,670
is what is the simplest yeah formulation
of

2942
00:55:17,670 --> 00:55:17,680
of
 

2943
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:19,910
of
that to study i think i think i'm much

2944
00:55:19,910 --> 00:55:19,920
that to study i think i think i'm much
 

2945
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,510
that to study i think i think i'm much
more comfortable with the idea of

2946
00:55:21,510 --> 00:55:21,520
more comfortable with the idea of
 

2947
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:23,750
more comfortable with the idea of
studying self-awareness

2948
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:23,760
studying self-awareness
 

2949
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,670
studying self-awareness
as opposed to consciousness because that

2950
00:55:25,670 --> 00:55:25,680
as opposed to consciousness because that
 

2951
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:28,309
as opposed to consciousness because that
that sort of gets rid of the mystical

2952
00:55:28,309 --> 00:55:28,319
that sort of gets rid of the mystical
 

2953
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:31,829
that sort of gets rid of the mystical
aura of the thing and self-awareness

2954
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:31,839
aura of the thing and self-awareness
 

2955
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:35,430
aura of the thing and self-awareness
is uh in simple you know the

2956
00:55:35,430 --> 00:55:35,440
is uh in simple you know the
 

2957
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:38,870
is uh in simple you know the
i think uh contiguous at least

2958
00:55:38,870 --> 00:55:38,880
i think uh contiguous at least
 

2959
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:42,069
i think uh contiguous at least
with ideas about feedback so

2960
00:55:42,069 --> 00:55:42,079
with ideas about feedback so
 

2961
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:44,470
with ideas about feedback so
if you have a system that looks at its

2962
00:55:44,470 --> 00:55:44,480
if you have a system that looks at its
 

2963
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:45,270
if you have a system that looks at its
own state

2964
00:55:45,270 --> 00:55:45,280
own state
 

2965
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:47,670
own state
and responds to it that's a kind of

2966
00:55:47,670 --> 00:55:47,680
and responds to it that's a kind of
 

2967
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:50,789
and responds to it that's a kind of
self-awareness

2969
00:55:50,799 --> 00:55:54,710

and more sophisticated versions could be

2970
00:55:54,710 --> 00:55:54,720
and more sophisticated versions could be
 

2971
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:55,109

00:55:55,109 --> 00:55:55,119
like
 

2973
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:57,270
like
in information processing things

2974
00:55:57,270 --> 00:55:57,280
in information processing things
 

2975
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:59,030
in information processing things
computers that look into their own

2976
00:55:59,030 --> 00:55:59,040
computers that look into their own
 

2977
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:03,109
computers that look into their own
internal state and do something about it

2978
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:03,119
internal state and do something about it
 

2979
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:07,109
internal state and do something about it
and i think that could also be

2980
00:56:07,109 --> 00:56:07,119
and i think that could also be
 

2981
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:09,030
and i think that could also be
done in neural nets this is called

2982
00:56:09,030 --> 00:56:09,040
done in neural nets this is called
 

2983
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:10,789
done in neural nets this is called
recurrent neural nets which are hard to

2984
00:56:10,789 --> 00:56:10,799
recurrent neural nets which are hard to
 

2985
00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:12,870
recurrent neural nets which are hard to
understand and kind of a frontier of

2986
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:12,880
understand and kind of a frontier of
 

2987
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:16,630
understand and kind of a frontier of
the the uh uh so i think understanding

2988
00:56:16,630 --> 00:56:16,640
the the uh uh so i think understanding
 

2989
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,230
the the uh uh so i think understanding
those

2990
00:56:18,230 --> 00:56:18,240
those
 

2991
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:22,150
those
and gradually building up a kind of

2992
00:56:22,150 --> 00:56:22,160
and gradually building up a kind of
 

2993
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:25,670
and gradually building up a kind of
uh profound

2994
00:56:25,670 --> 00:56:25,680
uh profound
 

2995
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:29,190
uh profound
ability to un to uh

2996
00:56:29,190 --> 00:56:29,200
ability to un to uh
 

2997
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,190
ability to un to uh
conceptualize different levels of

2998
00:56:31,190 --> 00:56:31,200
conceptualize different levels of
 

2999
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,109
conceptualize different levels of
self-awareness what do you have to not

3000
00:56:33,109 --> 00:56:33,119
self-awareness what do you have to not
 

3001
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:34,470
self-awareness what do you have to not
know and what do you have to know

3002
00:56:34,470 --> 00:56:34,480
know and what do you have to know
 

3003
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:36,390
know and what do you have to know
and when do you know that you don't know

3004
00:56:36,390 --> 00:56:36,400
and when do you know that you don't know
 

3005
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:37,670
and when do you know that you don't know
it or when do you know what do you think

3006
00:56:37,670 --> 00:56:37,680
it or when do you know what do you think
 

3007
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:39,750
it or when do you know what do you think
you know that you don't really know

3008
00:56:39,750 --> 00:56:39,760
you know that you don't really know
 

3009
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:43,990
you know that you don't really know
the the these uh i think uh

3010
00:56:43,990 --> 00:56:44,000
the the these uh i think uh
 

3011
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,549
the the these uh i think uh
clarifying those issues when we clarify

3012
00:56:46,549 --> 00:56:46,559
clarifying those issues when we clarify
 

3013
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:48,710
clarifying those issues when we clarify
those issues and get a rich theory

3014
00:56:48,710 --> 00:56:48,720
those issues and get a rich theory
 

3015
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:51,829
those issues and get a rich theory
around uh self-awareness i think

3016
00:56:51,829 --> 00:56:51,839
around uh self-awareness i think
 

3017
00:56:51,839 --> 00:56:54,950
around uh self-awareness i think
the that will illuminate

3018
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:54,960
the that will illuminate
 

3019
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,789
the that will illuminate
the questions about consciousness in a

3020
00:56:56,789 --> 00:56:56,799
the questions about consciousness in a
 

3021
00:56:56,799 --> 00:56:59,190
the questions about consciousness in a
way that you know scratching your chin

3022
00:56:59,190 --> 00:56:59,200
way that you know scratching your chin
 

3023
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:02,309
way that you know scratching your chin
and talking about qualia and blah blah

3024
00:57:02,309 --> 00:57:02,319
and talking about qualia and blah blah
 

3025
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:03,030
and talking about qualia and blah blah
blah blah

3026
00:57:03,030 --> 00:57:03,040
blah blah
 

3027
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:05,430
blah blah
is never going to do well i also have a

3028
00:57:05,430 --> 00:57:05,440
is never going to do well i also have a
 

3029
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:07,109
is never going to do well i also have a
different approach to the whole thing so

3030
00:57:07,109 --> 00:57:07,119
different approach to the whole thing so
 

3031
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:09,190
different approach to the whole thing so
there's from a robotics perspective you

3032
00:57:09,190 --> 00:57:09,200
there's from a robotics perspective you
 

3033
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:10,789
there's from a robotics perspective you
can engineer

3034
00:57:10,789 --> 00:57:10,799
can engineer
 

3035
00:57:10,799 --> 00:57:13,270
can engineer
things that exhibit yes qualities of

3036
00:57:13,270 --> 00:57:13,280
things that exhibit yes qualities of
 

3037
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:15,990
things that exhibit yes qualities of
consciousness without understanding

3038
00:57:15,990 --> 00:57:16,000
consciousness without understanding
 

3039
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,750
consciousness without understanding
well well the how things work

3040
00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:19,760
well well the how things work
 

3041
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:23,589
well well the how things work
and from that perspective you uh

3042
00:57:23,589 --> 00:57:23,599
and from that perspective you uh
 

3043
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:26,230
and from that perspective you uh
it's like a back door like enter through

3044
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:26,240
it's like a back door like enter through
 

3045
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:27,910
it's like a back door like enter through
the psychology door

3046
00:57:27,910 --> 00:57:27,920
the psychology door
 

3047
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:30,789
the psychology door
precisely the car yeah i think we're on

3048
00:57:30,789 --> 00:57:30,799
precisely the car yeah i think we're on
 

3049
00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:32,150
precisely the car yeah i think we're on
we're on the same wavelength here i

3050
00:57:32,150 --> 00:57:32,160
we're on the same wavelength here i
 

3051
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:33,190
we're on the same wavelength here i
think that

3052
00:57:33,190 --> 00:57:33,200
think that
 

3053
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:36,309
think that
and let me just add one comment which is

3054
00:57:36,309 --> 00:57:36,319
and let me just add one comment which is
 

3055
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:40,069
and let me just add one comment which is
uh i think we should try to understand

3056
00:57:40,069 --> 00:57:40,079
uh i think we should try to understand
 

3057
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:43,190
uh i think we should try to understand
consciousness as we experience it

3058
00:57:43,190 --> 00:57:43,200
consciousness as we experience it
 

3059
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:46,870
consciousness as we experience it
uh in in as

3060
00:57:46,870 --> 00:57:46,880
uh in in as
 

3061
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:50,470
uh in in as
in evolutionary terms and ask ourselves

3062
00:57:50,470 --> 00:57:50,480
in evolutionary terms and ask ourselves
 

3063
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:53,589
in evolutionary terms and ask ourselves
why why does it happen this thing seems

3064
00:57:53,589 --> 00:57:53,599
why why does it happen this thing seems
 

3065
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:54,309
why why does it happen this thing seems
useful

3066
00:57:54,309 --> 00:57:54,319
useful
 

3067
00:57:54,319 --> 00:57:58,710
useful
why is it useful why is it useful

3068
00:57:58,710 --> 00:57:58,720

 

3069
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:00,549

i think we've got a conscious eye watch

3070
00:58:00,549 --> 00:58:00,559
i think we've got a conscious eye watch
 

3071
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:03,349
i think we've got a conscious eye watch
here interesting quest thank you siri

3072
00:58:03,349 --> 00:58:03,359
here interesting quest thank you siri
 

3073
00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:07,510
here interesting quest thank you siri
okay yeah

3074
00:58:07,510 --> 00:58:07,520
okay yeah
 

3075
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:10,630
okay yeah
get back i'll get back to you later uh

3076
00:58:10,630 --> 00:58:10,640
get back i'll get back to you later uh
 

3077
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:14,630
get back i'll get back to you later uh
yeah uh um and i think what we're gonna

3078
00:58:14,630 --> 00:58:14,640
yeah uh um and i think what we're gonna
 

3079
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:17,430
yeah uh um and i think what we're gonna
i'm i'm morally certain that what's

3080
00:58:17,430 --> 00:58:17,440
i'm i'm morally certain that what's
 

3081
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:18,710
i'm i'm morally certain that what's
going to emerge from

3082
00:58:18,710 --> 00:58:18,720
going to emerge from
 

3083
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:22,950
going to emerge from
analyzing recurrent neural nets and

3084
00:58:22,950 --> 00:58:22,960
analyzing recurrent neural nets and
 

3085
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:25,190
analyzing recurrent neural nets and
robotic design and advanced computer

3086
00:58:25,190 --> 00:58:25,200
robotic design and advanced computer
 

3087
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:26,309
robotic design and advanced computer
design

3088
00:58:26,309 --> 00:58:26,319
design
 

3089
00:58:26,319 --> 00:58:29,670
design
is that having this kind of

3090
00:58:29,670 --> 00:58:29,680
is that having this kind of
 

3091
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:33,829
is that having this kind of
looking at the internal state

3092
00:58:33,829 --> 00:58:33,839
looking at the internal state
 

3093
00:58:33,839 --> 00:58:36,950
looking at the internal state
in a structured way that

3094
00:58:36,950 --> 00:58:36,960
in a structured way that
 

3095
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:38,630
in a structured way that
that doesn't look at everything as guys

3096
00:58:38,630 --> 00:58:38,640
that doesn't look at everything as guys
 

3097
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:41,030
that doesn't look at everything as guys
has it's encapsulated looks at highly

3098
00:58:41,030 --> 00:58:41,040
has it's encapsulated looks at highly
 

3099
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:42,870
has it's encapsulated looks at highly
processed information and very selective

3100
00:58:42,870 --> 00:58:42,880
processed information and very selective
 

3101
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:43,670
processed information and very selective
and makes

3102
00:58:43,670 --> 00:58:43,680
and makes
 

3103
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,349
and makes
choices without knowing how they're made

3104
00:58:45,349 --> 00:58:45,359
choices without knowing how they're made
 

3105
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:46,390
choices without knowing how they're made
there's so there'll also be an

3106
00:58:46,390 --> 00:58:46,400
there's so there'll also be an
 

3107
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:47,190
there's so there'll also be an
unconscious

3108
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:47,200
unconscious
 

3109
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,589
unconscious
i think that that is going to be turn

3110
00:58:49,589 --> 00:58:49,599
i think that that is going to be turn
 

3111
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:50,710
i think that that is going to be turn
out to be

3112
00:58:50,710 --> 00:58:50,720
out to be
 

3113
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:53,190
out to be
really essential to doing efficient

3114
00:58:53,190 --> 00:58:53,200
really essential to doing efficient
 

3115
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,349
really essential to doing efficient
information processing

3116
00:58:55,349 --> 00:58:55,359
information processing
 

3117
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:59,190
information processing
and that's why it evolved

3118
00:58:59,190 --> 00:58:59,200
and that's why it evolved
 

3119
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:02,390
and that's why it evolved
because it's it's it's it's helpful

3120
00:59:02,390 --> 00:59:02,400
because it's it's it's it's helpful
 

3121
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:06,870
because it's it's it's it's helpful
in uh because brains come at a high cost

3122
00:59:06,870 --> 00:59:06,880
in uh because brains come at a high cost
 

3123
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:08,789
in uh because brains come at a high cost
yeah so there has to be there has to be

3124
00:59:08,789 --> 00:59:08,799
yeah so there has to be there has to be
 

3125
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:10,230
yeah so there has to be there has to be
a good why and there's a reason

3126
00:59:10,230 --> 00:59:10,240
a good why and there's a reason
 

3127
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:14,069
a good why and there's a reason
yeah they're rare in evolution uh

3128
00:59:14,069 --> 00:59:14,079
yeah they're rare in evolution uh
 

3129
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:16,950
yeah they're rare in evolution uh
you and uh big brains are rare in

3130
00:59:16,950 --> 00:59:16,960
you and uh big brains are rare in
 

3131
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:18,309
you and uh big brains are rare in
evolution and they

3132
00:59:18,309 --> 00:59:18,319
evolution and they
 

3133
00:59:18,319 --> 00:59:20,549
evolution and they
they come at a big cost you mean if you

3134
00:59:20,549 --> 00:59:20,559
they come at a big cost you mean if you
 

3135
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:21,829
they come at a big cost you mean if you
you they

3136
00:59:21,829 --> 00:59:21,839
you they
 

3137
00:59:21,839 --> 00:59:24,870
you they
they they have high metabolic

3138
00:59:24,870 --> 00:59:24,880
they they have high metabolic
 

3139
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:28,150
they they have high metabolic
demands uh they require

3140
00:59:28,150 --> 00:59:28,160
demands uh they require
 

3141
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:30,829
demands uh they require
you know very active lifestyle warm

3142
00:59:30,829 --> 00:59:30,839
you know very active lifestyle warm
 

3143
00:59:30,839 --> 00:59:32,630
you know very active lifestyle warm
bloodedness

3144
00:59:32,630 --> 00:59:32,640
bloodedness
 

3145
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:36,150
bloodedness
and take away from the

3146
00:59:36,150 --> 00:59:36,160
and take away from the
 

3147
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:38,309
and take away from the
ability to support metabolism of

3148
00:59:38,309 --> 00:59:38,319
ability to support metabolism of
 

3149
00:59:38,319 --> 00:59:41,109
ability to support metabolism of
digestion and so so it's it's uh

3150
00:59:41,109 --> 00:59:41,119
digestion and so so it's it's uh
 

3151
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:43,030
digestion and so so it's it's uh
it comes at a high cost it has to it has

3152
00:59:43,030 --> 00:59:43,040
it comes at a high cost it has to it has
 

3153
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:44,150
it comes at a high cost it has to it has
to pay back

3154
00:59:44,150 --> 00:59:44,160
to pay back
 

3155
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:46,069
to pay back
yeah i think it has a lot of value in

3156
00:59:46,069 --> 00:59:46,079
yeah i think it has a lot of value in
 

3157
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:47,430
yeah i think it has a lot of value in
social interaction so i

3158
00:59:47,430 --> 00:59:47,440
social interaction so i
 

3159
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:48,870
social interaction so i
actually i'm spending the rest of the

3160
00:59:48,870 --> 00:59:48,880
actually i'm spending the rest of the
 

3161
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:50,710
actually i'm spending the rest of the
day today and uh

3162
00:59:50,710 --> 00:59:50,720
day today and uh
 

3163
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:53,910
day today and uh
with uh our friends uh

3164
00:59:53,910 --> 00:59:53,920
with uh our friends uh
 

3165
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:56,710
with uh our friends uh
that are our legged friends in robotic

3166
00:59:56,710 --> 00:59:56,720
that are our legged friends in robotic
 

3167
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:59,109
that are our legged friends in robotic
form at boston dynamics

3168
00:59:59,109 --> 00:59:59,119
form at boston dynamics
 

3169
00:59:59,119 --> 01:00:02,309
form at boston dynamics
and i think so

3170
01:00:02,309 --> 01:00:02,319
and i think so
 

3171
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:04,069
and i think so
my probably biggest passion is human

3172
01:00:04,069 --> 01:00:04,079
my probably biggest passion is human
 

3173
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:05,670
my probably biggest passion is human
robot interaction

3174
01:00:05,670 --> 01:00:05,680
robot interaction
 

3175
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:08,789
robot interaction
and it seems that consciousness from the

3176
01:00:08,789 --> 01:00:08,799
and it seems that consciousness from the
 

3177
01:00:08,799 --> 01:00:11,829
and it seems that consciousness from the
perspective of the robot is very useful

3178
01:00:11,829 --> 01:00:11,839
perspective of the robot is very useful
 

3179
01:00:11,839 --> 01:00:14,230
perspective of the robot is very useful
to improve the human robot interaction

3180
01:00:14,230 --> 01:00:14,240
to improve the human robot interaction
 

3181
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:16,470
to improve the human robot interaction
experience

3182
01:00:16,470 --> 01:00:16,480
experience
 

3183
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:18,390
experience
the first the display of consciousness

3184
01:00:18,390 --> 01:00:18,400
the first the display of consciousness
 

3185
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:20,069
the first the display of consciousness
but then to me there's a gray area

3186
01:00:20,069 --> 01:00:20,079
but then to me there's a gray area
 

3187
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:21,910
but then to me there's a gray area
between the display of consciousness and

3188
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:21,920
between the display of consciousness and
 

3189
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:23,510
between the display of consciousness and
consciousness itself

3190
01:00:23,510 --> 01:00:23,520
consciousness itself
 

3191
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:25,109
consciousness itself
if you think of consciousness from an

3192
01:00:25,109 --> 01:00:25,119
if you think of consciousness from an
 

3193
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:26,789
if you think of consciousness from an
evolutionary perspective

3194
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:26,799
evolutionary perspective
 

3195
01:00:26,799 --> 01:00:28,549
evolutionary perspective
it seems like a useful tool in human

3196
01:00:28,549 --> 01:00:28,559
it seems like a useful tool in human
 

3197
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:30,230
it seems like a useful tool in human
communication so yes

3198
01:00:30,230 --> 01:00:30,240
communication so yes
 

3199
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:32,309
communication so yes
um it's certainly well whatever

3200
01:00:32,309 --> 01:00:32,319
um it's certainly well whatever
 

3201
01:00:32,319 --> 01:00:33,349
um it's certainly well whatever
consciousness it

3202
01:00:33,349 --> 01:00:33,359
consciousness it
 

3203
01:00:33,359 --> 01:00:36,309
consciousness it
will turn out to be i think uh

3204
01:00:36,309 --> 01:00:36,319
will turn out to be i think uh
 

3205
01:00:36,319 --> 01:00:37,270
will turn out to be i think uh
addressing it

3206
01:00:37,270 --> 01:00:37,280
addressing it
 

3207
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:40,950
addressing it
through its use yes and working up from

01:00:40,950 --> 01:00:40,960
through its use yes and working up from
 

3209
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:42,549

3221
01:00:53,359 --> 01:00:55,349

is going to really shed light on these

3222
01:00:55,349 --> 01:00:55,359
is going to really shed light on these
 

3223
01:00:55,359 --> 01:00:57,829
is going to really shed light on these
questions as i said in a way that

3224
01:00:57,829 --> 01:00:57,839
questions as i said in a way that
 

3225
01:00:57,839 --> 01:00:59,910
questions as i said in a way that
sort of musing abstractly about

01:00:59,910 --> 01:00:59,920
sort of musing abstractly about
 

3227
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:01,430
sort of musing abstractly about
consciousness never would

3228
01:01:01,430 --> 01:01:01,440
consciousness never would
 

3229
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:03,349
consciousness never would
so as i mentioned i talked to sarah

3230
01:01:03,349 --> 01:01:03,359
so as i mentioned i talked to sarah
 

3231
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:04,789
so as i mentioned i talked to sarah
walker and

3232
01:01:04,789 --> 01:01:04,799
walker and
 

3233
01:01:04,799 --> 01:01:06,309
walker and
first of all she says hi spoke very

3234
01:01:06,309 --> 01:01:06,319
first of all she says hi spoke very
 

3235
01:01:06,319 --> 01:01:08,829
first of all she says hi spoke very
highly of you one of her concerns about

3236
01:01:08,829 --> 01:01:08,839
highly of you one of her concerns about
 

3237
01:01:08,839 --> 01:01:09,990
highly of you one of her concerns about
physics

3238
01:01:09,990 --> 01:01:10,000
physics
 

3239
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,670
physics
and physicists and humans is that

3240
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:13,680
and physicists and humans is that
 

3241
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:16,789
and physicists and humans is that
we may not fully understand the system

3242
01:01:16,789 --> 01:01:16,799
we may not fully understand the system
 

3243
01:01:16,799 --> 01:01:20,390
we may not fully understand the system
that we're inside of meaning

3244
01:01:20,390 --> 01:01:20,400
that we're inside of meaning
 

3245
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:23,349
that we're inside of meaning
like there may be limits to the kind of

3246
01:01:23,349 --> 01:01:23,359
like there may be limits to the kind of
 

3247
01:01:23,359 --> 01:01:24,309
like there may be limits to the kind of
physics we do

3248
01:01:24,309 --> 01:01:24,319
physics we do
 

3249
01:01:24,319 --> 01:01:26,789
physics we do
in trying to understand the system of

3250
01:01:26,789 --> 01:01:26,799
in trying to understand the system of
 

3251
01:01:26,799 --> 01:01:27,750
in trying to understand the system of
which we're

3252
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:27,760
which we're
 

3253
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:31,510
which we're
part of so like the the observer

3254
01:01:31,510 --> 01:01:31,520
part of so like the the observer
 

3255
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:35,349
part of so like the the observer
is also the observed in in that sense

3256
01:01:35,349 --> 01:01:35,359
is also the observed in in that sense
 

3257
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:39,510
is also the observed in in that sense
it seems like the the um

3258
01:01:39,510 --> 01:01:39,520
it seems like the the um
 

3259
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:42,549
it seems like the the um
our tools of understanding the world

3260
01:01:42,549 --> 01:01:42,559
our tools of understanding the world
 

3261
01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:44,150
our tools of understanding the world
i mean this is mostly centered around

3262
01:01:44,150 --> 01:01:44,160
i mean this is mostly centered around
 

3263
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:45,910
i mean this is mostly centered around
the questions of what is life

3264
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:45,920
the questions of what is life
 

3265
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:47,750
the questions of what is life
trying to understand the patterns that

3266
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:47,760
trying to understand the patterns that
 

3267
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:50,549
trying to understand the patterns that
uh that are characteristic of life and

3268
01:01:50,549 --> 01:01:50,559
uh that are characteristic of life and
 

3269
01:01:50,559 --> 01:01:52,309
uh that are characteristic of life and
intelligence all those kinds of things

3270
01:01:52,309 --> 01:01:52,319
intelligence all those kinds of things
 

3271
01:01:52,319 --> 01:01:54,950
intelligence all those kinds of things
um we we're not we're not using the

3272
01:01:54,950 --> 01:01:54,960
um we we're not we're not using the
 

3273
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:55,670
um we we're not we're not using the
right tools

3274
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:55,680
right tools
 

3275
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:57,990
right tools
because we're in the system is there is

3276
01:01:57,990 --> 01:01:58,000
because we're in the system is there is
 

3277
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,390
because we're in the system is there is
there something that resonates with you

3278
01:02:00,390 --> 01:02:00,400
there something that resonates with you
 

3279
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:04,789
there something that resonates with you
there almost well yeah yes we do have we

3280
01:02:04,789 --> 01:02:04,799
there almost well yeah yes we do have we
 

3281
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:08,470
there almost well yeah yes we do have we
we have limitations of course uh

3282
01:02:08,470 --> 01:02:08,480
we have limitations of course uh
 

3283
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:10,789
we have limitations of course uh
in the amount of information we can

3284
01:02:10,789 --> 01:02:10,799
in the amount of information we can
 

3285
01:02:10,799 --> 01:02:12,150
in the amount of information we can
process

3286
01:02:12,150 --> 01:02:12,160
process
 

3287
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:14,789
process
uh on the other hand we can get help

3288
01:02:14,789 --> 01:02:14,799
uh on the other hand we can get help
 

3289
01:02:14,799 --> 01:02:16,870
uh on the other hand we can get help
from our silicon friends

3290
01:02:16,870 --> 01:02:16,880
from our silicon friends
 

3291
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:20,549
from our silicon friends
and we uh we can get help from all kinds

3292
01:02:20,549 --> 01:02:20,559
and we uh we can get help from all kinds
 

3293
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:22,470
and we uh we can get help from all kinds
of instruments that make up for for our

3294
01:02:22,470 --> 01:02:22,480
of instruments that make up for for our
 

3295
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:24,950
of instruments that make up for for our
perceptual deficits

01:02:48,309 --> 01:02:48,319
a three-dimensional world well we can do
 

3317
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:50,549
a three-dimensional world well we can do
that i mean you know we

3318
01:02:50,549 --> 01:02:50,559
that i mean you know we
 

3319
01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:52,549
that i mean you know we
in fact we you know for practical

3320
01:02:52,549 --> 01:02:52,559
in fact we you know for practical
 

3321
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:54,549
in fact we you know for practical

01:02:56,470 --> 01:02:56,480
is two-dimensional it's hard to move
 

3325
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:59,349
is two-dimensional it's hard to move
vertically and yet we've produced

vertically and yet we've produced
 

3327
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:01,190
vertically and yet we've produced
conceptually a three-dimensional

3328

conceptually a three-dimensional
 

3329
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:02,549
conceptually a three-dimensional

four-dimensional space-time uh so

3332
01:03:06,069 --> 01:03:06,079
four-dimensional space-time uh so
 

3333
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:08,950
four-dimensional space-time uh so
you know by thinking in appropriate ways

let me give you an example i mean for
instance uh

3354
01:03:34,230 --> 01:03:34,240
instance uh
 

3355
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:36,230

uh qcd our theory of the strong

3356
01:03:36,230 --> 01:03:36,240
uh qcd our theory of the strong
 

3357
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:37,829
uh qcd our theory of the strong
interaction has

3358
01:03:37,829 --> 01:03:37,839
interaction has
 

3359
01:03:37,839 --> 01:03:39,029
interaction has
nice equations which i helped to

3360
01:03:39,029 --> 01:03:39,039
nice equations which i helped to
 

3361
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:41,190
nice equations which i helped to
discover what's qcd

3362
01:03:41,190 --> 01:03:41,200
discover what's qcd
 

3363
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:43,510
discover what's qcd
quantum chromodynamics so it's our

3364
01:03:43,510 --> 01:03:43,520
quantum chromodynamics so it's our
 

3365
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:44,390
quantum chromodynamics so it's our
theory

3366
01:03:44,390 --> 01:03:44,400
theory
 

3367
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:47,750
theory
of the strong interaction the

3368
01:03:47,750 --> 01:03:47,760
of the strong interaction the
 

3369
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:50,309
of the strong interaction the
interaction that is responsible for

3370
01:03:50,309 --> 01:03:50,319
interaction that is responsible for
 

3371
01:03:50,319 --> 01:03:52,390
interaction that is responsible for
nuclear physics so it's the interaction

3372
01:03:52,390 --> 01:03:52,400
nuclear physics so it's the interaction
 

3373
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:54,230
nuclear physics so it's the interaction
that governs how quarks and gluons

3374
01:03:54,230 --> 01:03:54,240
that governs how quarks and gluons
 

3375
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:57,589
that governs how quarks and gluons
interact with each other and make

3376
01:03:57,589 --> 01:03:57,599

 

3377
01:03:57,599 --> 01:03:59,589

make protons and neutrons and all the

3378
01:03:59,589 --> 01:03:59,599
make protons and neutrons and all the
 

3379
01:03:59,599 --> 01:04:01,190
make protons and neutrons and all the
strong the

3380
01:04:01,190 --> 01:04:01,200

3381
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:04,710
strong the
related particles and among many things

3382
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:04,720
related particles and among many things
 

3383
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:06,069
related particles and among many things
in physics it's one of the

3384
01:04:06,069 --> 01:04:06,079
in physics it's one of the
 

3385
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:08,390
in physics it's one of the
four basic forces of nature as we

3386
01:04:08,390 --> 01:04:08,400
four basic forces of nature as we
 

3387
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,069
four basic forces of nature as we
presently understand it

3388
01:04:10,069 --> 01:04:10,079
presently understand it
 

3389
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:13,510
presently understand it
uh and

3390
01:04:13,510 --> 01:04:13,520
uh and
 

3391
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:15,910
uh and
uh so we have beautiful equations which

3392
01:04:15,910 --> 01:04:15,920
uh so we have beautiful equations which
 

3393
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:17,109
uh so we have beautiful equations which
we can

3394
01:04:17,109 --> 01:04:17,119
we can
 

3395
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:21,029
we can
test in very special circumstances

3396
01:04:21,029 --> 01:04:21,039
test in very special circumstances
 

3397
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:24,870
test in very special circumstances
uh uh using at high high energies at

3398
01:04:24,870 --> 01:04:24,880
uh uh using at high high energies at
 

3399
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:26,710
uh uh using at high high energies at
accelerator so we're

3400
01:04:26,710 --> 01:04:26,720
accelerator so we're
 

3401
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:28,309
accelerator so we're
certain that these equations are correct

3402
01:04:28,309 --> 01:04:28,319
certain that these equations are correct
 

3403
01:04:28,319 --> 01:04:30,470
certain that these equations are correct
you know prizes are given for it and so

3404
01:04:30,470 --> 01:04:30,480
you know prizes are given for it and so
 

3405
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:32,069
you know prizes are given for it and so
people try to knock it down and they

3406
01:04:32,069 --> 01:04:32,079
people try to knock it down and they
 

3407
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:33,990
people try to knock it down and they
can't and yeah they they the

3408
01:04:33,990 --> 01:04:34,000
can't and yeah they they the
 

3409
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,990
can't and yeah they they the
they uh uh but

3410
01:04:37,990 --> 01:04:38,000
they uh uh but
 

3411
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:42,230
they uh uh but
uh but the situations in which you can

3412
01:04:42,230 --> 01:04:42,240
uh but the situations in which you can
 

3413
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:44,069
uh but the situations in which you can
calculate the consequences of these

3414
01:04:44,069 --> 01:04:44,079
calculate the consequences of these
 

3415
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:46,150
calculate the consequences of these
equations are very limited

3416
01:04:46,150 --> 01:04:46,160
equations are very limited
 

3417
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:49,750
equations are very limited
so for instance no one has been

3418
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:49,760
so for instance no one has been
 

3419
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:52,789
so for instance no one has been
able to demonstrate that

3420
01:04:52,789 --> 01:04:52,799
able to demonstrate that
 

3421
01:04:52,799 --> 01:04:56,470
able to demonstrate that
this theory which is built on

3422
01:04:56,470 --> 01:04:56,480
this theory which is built on
 

3423
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:59,349
this theory which is built on
quarks and gluons which no one that

3424
01:04:59,349 --> 01:04:59,359
quarks and gluons which no one that
 

3425
01:04:59,359 --> 01:05:01,029
quarks and gluons which no one that
which you don't observe

3426
01:05:01,029 --> 01:05:01,039
which you don't observe
 

3427
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:03,190
which you don't observe
actually produces protons and neutrons

3428
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:03,200
actually produces protons and neutrons
 

3429
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:04,710
actually produces protons and neutrons
and the things you do observe this is

3430
01:05:04,710 --> 01:05:04,720
and the things you do observe this is
 

3431
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:07,510
and the things you do observe this is
called the problem of confinement

3432
01:05:07,510 --> 01:05:07,520
called the problem of confinement
 

3433
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:09,990
called the problem of confinement
so no one's been able to prove that

3434
01:05:09,990 --> 01:05:10,000
so no one's been able to prove that
 

3435
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,150
so no one's been able to prove that
analytically in a way that a human can

3436
01:05:12,150 --> 01:05:12,160
analytically in a way that a human can
 

3437
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:13,349
analytically in a way that a human can
understand

3438
01:05:13,349 --> 01:05:13,359

3439
01:05:13,359 --> 01:05:15,589

on the other hand we can take these

3440
01:05:15,589 --> 01:05:15,599
on the other hand we can take these
 

3441
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:16,470
on the other hand we can take these
equations

3442
01:05:16,470 --> 01:05:16,480

3443
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:19,270

01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:20,309
to a computer to gigantic computers and
compute

3446
01:05:20,309 --> 01:05:20,319
compute
 

3447
01:05:20,319 --> 01:05:23,990
compute
and by god you get the world

3448
01:05:23,990 --> 01:05:24,000
and by god you get the world
 

3449
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,190
and by god you get the world
from it the so these equations

3450
01:05:27,190 --> 01:05:27,200
from it the so these equations
 

3451
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:31,029

so with the help of what i like to call

3462
01:05:42,069 --> 01:05:42,079
so with the help of what i like to call
 

3463
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:44,150
so with the help of what i like to call
our silicon friends and

3464
01:05:44,150 --> 01:05:44,160
our silicon friends and
 

3465
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:46,789
our silicon friends and
their their descendants in the future we

3466
01:05:46,789 --> 01:05:46,799
their their descendants in the future we
 

3467
01:05:46,799 --> 01:05:47,670
their their descendants in the future we
can

3468
01:05:47,670 --> 01:05:47,680
can
 

3469
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:50,789
can
understand in a different way that

3470
01:05:50,789 --> 01:05:50,799
understand in a different way that
 

3471
01:05:50,799 --> 01:05:52,870
understand in a different way that
allows us to understand more

3472
01:05:52,870 --> 01:05:52,880
allows us to understand more
 

3473
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:55,829
allows us to understand more
but i don't think we'll ever no no human

3474
01:05:55,829 --> 01:05:55,839
but i don't think we'll ever no no human
 

3475
01:05:55,839 --> 01:05:57,910
but i don't think we'll ever no no human
is ever going to be able to calculus

3476
01:05:57,910 --> 01:05:57,920
is ever going to be able to calculus
 

3477
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:01,430
is ever going to be able to calculus
solve those equations in the same way so

3478
01:06:01,430 --> 01:06:01,440
solve those equations in the same way so
 

3479
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:04,789
solve those equations in the same way so
so but but i think that's you know when

3480
01:06:04,789 --> 01:06:04,799
so but but i think that's you know when
 

3481
01:06:04,799 --> 01:06:07,270
so but but i think that's you know when
we find limitations to

3482
01:06:07,270 --> 01:06:07,280
we find limitations to
 

3483
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:10,630
we find limitations to
our natural abilities we can

3484
01:06:10,630 --> 01:06:10,640
our natural abilities we can
 

3485
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:12,950
our natural abilities we can
try to find works or workarounds and

3486
01:06:12,950 --> 01:06:12,960
try to find works or workarounds and
 

3487
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:15,029
try to find works or workarounds and
sometimes that's appropriate concepts

3488
01:06:15,029 --> 01:06:15,039
sometimes that's appropriate concepts
 

3489
01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:17,190
sometimes that's appropriate concepts
sometimes it's appropriate instruments

3490
01:06:17,190 --> 01:06:17,200
sometimes it's appropriate instruments
 

3491
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:19,670
sometimes it's appropriate instruments
sometimes it's a combination of the two

3492
01:06:19,670 --> 01:06:19,680
sometimes it's a combination of the two
 

3493
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:20,870
sometimes it's a combination of the two
but i think

3494
01:06:20,870 --> 01:06:20,880
but i think
 

3495
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:24,870
but i think
uh it's premature to

3496
01:06:24,870 --> 01:06:24,880
uh it's premature to
 

3497
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:26,789
uh it's premature to
get defeatist about it i don't see

3498
01:06:26,789 --> 01:06:26,799
get defeatist about it i don't see
 

3499
01:06:26,799 --> 01:06:28,470
get defeatist about it i don't see
anything i don't see any

human beings are hard to understand and
 

3557

01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:34,630
the concepts that
you use to understand human beings if

3624
01:08:39,749 --> 01:08:39,759
i think it's a wonderful yeah it's it's
 

3625
01:08:39,759 --> 01:08:41,430
i think it's a wonderful yeah it's it's
sort of to me it's it's well it's the

3626
01:08:41,430 --> 01:08:41,440
sort of to me it's it's well it's the
 

3627
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:43,269
sort of to me it's it's well it's the
culminating chapter of the book and i

3628
01:08:43,269 --> 01:08:43,279
culminating chapter of the book and i
 

3629
01:08:43,279 --> 01:08:44,229
culminating chapter of the book and i
think

3630
01:08:44,229 --> 01:08:44,239
think
 

3631
01:08:44,239 --> 01:08:47,669
think
uh since the whole book is about the big

3632
01:08:47,669 --> 01:08:47,679
uh since the whole book is about the big
 

3633
01:08:47,679 --> 01:08:50,789
uh since the whole book is about the big
lessons or big takeaways

3634
01:08:50,789 --> 01:08:50,799
lessons or big takeaways
 

3635
01:08:50,799 --> 01:08:52,630
lessons or big takeaways
from profound understanding of the

01:08:52,630 --> 01:08:52,640
from profound understanding of the
 

3637
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:54,309
from profound understanding of the
physical world that we've understood

physical world that we've understood

01:08:54,319 --> 01:08:57,189
physical world that we've understood
that we've achieved uh including that

that we've achieved uh including that
 

3641
01:08:57,199 --> 01:08:58,950
that we've achieved uh including that
it's mysterious in some ways

3642
01:08:58,950 --> 01:08:58,960
it's mysterious in some ways
 

3643
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:02,229
it's mysterious in some ways
the uh this was the the

which is so weird

01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:35,669
which is so weird
yeah well but it seems to work in so

yeah well but it seems to work in so
 

3721
01:10:35,679 --> 01:10:37,990
yeah well but it seems to work in so
many cases it works in many cases and i

it's uh it's a deep fact about

it's uh it's a deep fact about

it's uh it's a deep fact about

the primary description of the world

01:11:00,719 --> 01:11:03,669
the primary description of the world
is in terms of wave functions but let's

is in terms of wave functions but let's
 

3743
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:04,950
is in terms of wave functions but let's
not talk about the world let's just talk

not talk about the world let's just talk
 

3745
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:05,669
not talk about the world let's just talk
about a

3746
01:11:05,669 --> 01:11:05,679
about a

01:11:05,679 --> 01:11:08,950
about a
a particle an electron okay it's it's

electron
 

3753
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:15,430
electron
is its wave function and the wave

3754
01:11:15,430 --> 01:11:15,440
is its wave function and the wave
 

3755
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:17,830
is its wave function and the wave
function can be used to

3756
01:11:17,830 --> 01:11:17,840
function can be used to
 

3757
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:21,110
function can be used to
predict where it's going to be

be in different places with different

be in different places with different
 

3763
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:25,590
be in different places with different

probabilities
 

3765
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:28,790
probabilities
or how fast it's moving and it will also

3766
01:11:28,790 --> 01:11:28,800
or how fast it's moving and it will also
 

3767
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:31,510
or how fast it's moving and it will also
be moving in different ways with

be moving in different ways with
 

3769
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:33,110
be moving in different ways with
different probabilities that's what

3770
01:11:33,110 --> 01:11:33,120
different probabilities that's what
 

3771
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:35,110
different probabilities that's what
quantum mechanics says

3772
01:11:35,110 --> 01:11:35,120
quantum mechanics says
 

3773
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:37,910
quantum mechanics says
and you can predict either set of

3774
01:11:37,910 --> 01:11:37,920
and you can predict either set of
 

3775
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:39,270
and you can predict either set of
probabilities if you

3776
01:11:39,270 --> 01:11:39,280
probabilities if you
 

3777
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:41,590
probabilities if you
what's going to happen if i make an

3778
01:11:41,590 --> 01:11:41,600
what's going to happen if i make an
 

3779
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:42,870
what's going to happen if i make an
observation

3780
01:11:42,870 --> 01:11:42,880
observation
 

3781
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:47,270
observation
of the position or the velocity

3782
01:11:47,270 --> 01:11:47,280
of the position or the velocity
 

3783
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:50,070
of the position or the velocity
but so the wave function gives you ways

3784
01:11:50,070 --> 01:11:50,080
but so the wave function gives you ways
 

3785
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:51,510
but so the wave function gives you ways
of doing both of those

3786
01:11:51,510 --> 01:11:51,520
of doing both of those
 

3787
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:54,310
of doing both of those
but to do it to get those predictions

3788
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:54,320
but to do it to get those predictions
 

3789
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:56,070
but to do it to get those predictions
you have to process the wave function in

3790
01:11:56,070 --> 01:11:56,080
you have to process the wave function in
 

3791
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:57,110
you have to process the wave function in
different ways

3792
01:11:57,110 --> 01:11:57,120
different ways
 

3793
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:59,110
different ways
you process it one way for position and

3794
01:11:59,110 --> 01:11:59,120
you process it one way for position and
 

3795
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:00,470
you process it one way for position and
in a different way for

3796
01:12:00,470 --> 01:12:00,480
in a different way for
 

3797
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:02,470
in a different way for
momentum and those ways are

3798
01:12:02,470 --> 01:12:02,480
momentum and those ways are
 

3799
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:05,350
momentum and those ways are
mathematically incompatible

3800
01:12:05,350 --> 01:12:05,360
mathematically incompatible
 

3801
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:07,910
mathematically incompatible
it's like you know it's like you have a

3802
01:12:07,910 --> 01:12:07,920
it's like you know it's like you have a
 

3803
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:09,430
it's like you know it's like you have a
stone and you can sculpt it

3804
01:12:09,430 --> 01:12:09,440
stone and you can sculpt it
 

3805
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:12,310
stone and you can sculpt it
into a venus de milo or you can sculpt

3806
01:12:12,310 --> 01:12:12,320
into a venus de milo or you can sculpt
 

3807
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:14,310
into a venus de milo or you can sculpt
it into david but you can't do both

3808
01:12:14,310 --> 01:12:14,320
it into david but you can't do both
 

3809
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:17,910
it into david but you can't do both
you can uh and uh

3810
01:12:17,910 --> 01:12:17,920
you can uh and uh
 

3811
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:20,229
you can uh and uh
and that's an example of complementarity

3812
01:12:20,229 --> 01:12:20,239
and that's an example of complementarity
 

3813
01:12:20,239 --> 01:12:21,830
and that's an example of complementarity

but to answer different kinds of
 

3815
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:24,390
but to answer different kinds of

of questions
so in that case it's a theorem but i

3826
01:12:35,189 --> 01:12:35,199
so in that case it's a theorem but i
 

3827
01:12:35,199 --> 01:12:36,310
so in that case it's a theorem but i
think

3828
01:12:36,310 --> 01:12:36,320
think
 

3829
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:38,709
think
it's a much more widespread phenomena

3830
01:12:38,709 --> 01:12:38,719
it's a much more widespread phenomena
 

3831
01:12:38,719 --> 01:12:40,550
it's a much more widespread phenomena
that applies to many cases where we

3832
01:12:40,550 --> 01:12:40,560
that applies to many cases where we
 

3833
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:42,310
that applies to many cases where we
can't prove it as a theorem

3834
01:12:42,310 --> 01:12:42,320
can't prove it as a theorem
 

3835
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:46,070
can't prove it as a theorem
but uh it's a piece of wisdom if you

3836
01:12:46,070 --> 01:12:46,080
but uh it's a piece of wisdom if you
 

3837
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:48,149
but uh it's a piece of wisdom if you
like and then

3838
01:12:48,149 --> 01:12:48,159
like and then
 

3839
01:12:48,159 --> 01:12:52,070
like and then
appears to be a a very important insight

3840
01:12:52,070 --> 01:12:52,080
appears to be a a very important insight
 

3841
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:53,910
appears to be a a very important insight
do you uh and if you ignore it you can

3842
01:12:53,910 --> 01:12:53,920
do you uh and if you ignore it you can
 

3843
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:56,070
do you uh and if you ignore it you can
get very

3844
01:12:56,070 --> 01:12:56,080
get very
 

3845
01:12:56,080 --> 01:13:00,630
get very
confused and uh

3846
01:13:00,630 --> 01:13:00,640

 

3847
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:04,950

misguided do you think this is um

3848
01:13:04,950 --> 01:13:04,960
misguided do you think this is um
 

3849
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:07,990
misguided do you think this is um
a useful hack for

3850
01:13:07,990 --> 01:13:08,000
a useful hack for
 

3851
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,709
a useful hack for
ideas that we don't fully understand or

3852
01:13:10,709 --> 01:13:10,719
ideas that we don't fully understand or
 

3853
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:11,669
ideas that we don't fully understand or
is this

3854
01:13:11,669 --> 01:13:11,679
is this
 

3855
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:14,790
is this
somehow a fundamental property of all

3856
01:13:14,790 --> 01:13:14,800
somehow a fundamental property of all
 

3857
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:18,070
somehow a fundamental property of all
or many ideas that you can take

3858
01:13:18,070 --> 01:13:18,080
or many ideas that you can take
 

3859
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:19,990
or many ideas that you can take
multiple perspectives and they're both

3860
01:13:19,990 --> 01:13:20,000
multiple perspectives and they're both
 

3861
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:24,070
multiple perspectives and they're both
true well i think it's both

3862
01:13:24,070 --> 01:13:24,080

 

3863
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:25,910

those both the answer to all questions

3864
01:13:25,910 --> 01:13:25,920
those both the answer to all questions
 

3865
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:27,270
those both the answer to all questions
yes that's right

3866
01:13:27,270 --> 01:13:27,280
yes that's right
 

3867
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:28,950
yes that's right
it's not either or it's both it's

3868
01:13:28,950 --> 01:13:28,960
it's not either or it's both it's
 

3869
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:31,270
it's not either or it's both it's
paralyzing to think that

3870
01:13:31,270 --> 01:13:31,280
paralyzing to think that
 

3871
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:33,189
paralyzing to think that
that we live in a world that's

3872
01:13:33,189 --> 01:13:33,199
that we live in a world that's
 

3873
01:13:33,199 --> 01:13:34,950
that we live in a world that's
fundamentally

3874
01:13:34,950 --> 01:13:34,960
fundamentally
 

3875
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:37,189
fundamentally
like surrounded by complementary ideas

3876
01:13:37,189 --> 01:13:37,199
like surrounded by complementary ideas
 

3877
01:13:37,199 --> 01:13:39,110
like surrounded by complementary ideas
like

3878
01:13:39,110 --> 01:13:39,120
like
 

3879
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:42,149
like
uh because it uh we want universe we

3880
01:13:42,149 --> 01:13:42,159
uh because it uh we want universe we
 

3881
01:13:42,159 --> 01:13:44,149
uh because it uh we want universe we
somehow want to attach ourselves to

3882
01:13:44,149 --> 01:13:44,159
somehow want to attach ourselves to
 

3883
01:13:44,159 --> 01:13:45,590
somehow want to attach ourselves to
absolute truths

3884
01:13:45,590 --> 01:13:45,600
absolute truths
 

3885
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:47,830
absolute truths
and absolute truths certainly don't like

3886
01:13:47,830 --> 01:13:47,840
and absolute truths certainly don't like
 

3887
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:48,790
and absolute truths certainly don't like
the idea of

3888
01:13:48,790 --> 01:13:48,800
the idea of
 

3889
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:51,350
the idea of
complementarity yes einstein was very

3890
01:13:51,350 --> 01:13:51,360
complementarity yes einstein was very
 

3891
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:53,030
complementarity yes einstein was very
uncomfortable with complementarity

3892
01:13:53,030 --> 01:13:53,040
uncomfortable with complementarity
 

3893
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:55,990
uncomfortable with complementarity
and in a broad sense the famous poor

3894
01:13:55,990 --> 01:13:56,000
and in a broad sense the famous poor
 

3895
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:59,030
and in a broad sense the famous poor
einstein debates

3896
01:13:59,030 --> 01:13:59,040

 

3897
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:01,590

revolves around this question of whether

3898
01:14:01,590 --> 01:14:01,600
revolves around this question of whether
 

3899
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:04,470
revolves around this question of whether
the complementarity that

3900
01:14:04,470 --> 01:14:04,480
the complementarity that
 

3901
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:07,590
the complementarity that
is a foundational feature of quantum

3902
01:14:07,590 --> 01:14:07,600
is a foundational feature of quantum
 

3903
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:09,669
is a foundational feature of quantum
mechanics as we have it

3904
01:14:09,669 --> 01:14:09,679
mechanics as we have it
 

3905
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:13,110
mechanics as we have it
was is uh

3906
01:14:13,110 --> 01:14:13,120
was is uh
 

3907
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:16,470
was is uh
a permanent feature of of the universe

3908
01:14:16,470 --> 01:14:16,480
a permanent feature of of the universe
 

3909
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:18,950
a permanent feature of of the universe
and that's our description of nature

3910
01:14:18,950 --> 01:14:18,960
and that's our description of nature
 

3911
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:23,030
and that's our description of nature
and so far quantum mechanics wins

3912
01:14:23,030 --> 01:14:23,040
and so far quantum mechanics wins
 

3913
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:26,310
and so far quantum mechanics wins
and it's gone from triumph to triumph

3914
01:14:26,310 --> 01:14:26,320
and it's gone from triumph to triumph
 

3915
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:26,870
and it's gone from triumph to triumph
whether

3916
01:14:26,870 --> 01:14:26,880
whether
 

3917
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:28,870
whether
complementarity is rock bottom i guess

3918
01:14:28,870 --> 01:14:28,880
complementarity is rock bottom i guess
 

3919
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:29,910
complementarity is rock bottom i guess
we're you know

3920
01:14:29,910 --> 01:14:29,920
we're you know
 

3921
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:33,030
we're you know
you can never be sure i mean but but uh

3922
01:14:33,030 --> 01:14:33,040
you can never be sure i mean but but uh
 

3923
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:34,790
you can never be sure i mean but but uh
it looks awfully good and it's been very

3924
01:14:34,790 --> 01:14:34,800
it looks awfully good and it's been very
 

3925
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:36,070
it looks awfully good and it's been very
successful and

3926
01:14:36,070 --> 01:14:36,080
successful and
 

3927
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:38,630
successful and
certainly its complementarity has been

3928
01:14:38,630 --> 01:14:38,640
certainly its complementarity has been
 

3929
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:39,669
certainly its complementarity has been
extremely

3930
01:14:39,669 --> 01:14:39,679
extremely
 

3931
01:14:39,679 --> 01:14:43,590
extremely
useful and fruitful in in that domain

3932
01:14:43,590 --> 01:14:43,600
useful and fruitful in in that domain
 

3933
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:46,950
useful and fruitful in in that domain
uh including you know one of some of

3934
01:14:46,950 --> 01:14:46,960
uh including you know one of some of
 

3935
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:47,830
uh including you know one of some of
einstein's

3936
01:14:47,830 --> 01:14:47,840
einstein's
 

3937
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:51,189
einstein's
attempts to challenge it with

3938
01:14:51,189 --> 01:14:51,199
attempts to challenge it with
 

3939
01:14:51,199 --> 01:14:54,550
attempts to challenge it with
like the famous einstein podolsky rosen

3940
01:14:54,550 --> 01:14:54,560
like the famous einstein podolsky rosen
 

3941
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:56,149
like the famous einstein podolsky rosen
experiment turned out to be

3942
01:14:56,149 --> 01:14:56,159
experiment turned out to be
 

3943
01:14:56,159 --> 01:14:58,229
experiment turned out to be
confirmations of

3944
01:14:58,229 --> 01:14:58,239
confirmations of
 

3945
01:14:58,239 --> 01:15:01,510
confirmations of
that that uh have have been

3946
01:15:01,510 --> 01:15:01,520
that that uh have have been
 

3947
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:03,750
that that uh have have been
uh useful in themselves but so thinking

3948
01:15:03,750 --> 01:15:03,760
uh useful in themselves but so thinking
 

3949
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:05,830
uh useful in themselves but so thinking
about these things was fruitful but

3950
01:15:05,830 --> 01:15:05,840
about these things was fruitful but
 

3951
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:08,470
about these things was fruitful but

yeah so so as i said in in the case
 

3957
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:24,709
yeah so so as i said in in the case
of uh quantum mechanics and this

of uh quantum mechanics and this

incompatible and that the physical
 

3967
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,990
incompatible and that the physical
correlate of that is the heisenberg

3968

4119
01:18:38,719 --> 01:18:40,950
they both both heard and the
the sort of culmination of of the sermon

4120

the sort of culmination of of the sermon
 

4121
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:41,990
the sort of culmination of of the sermon
was

4122
01:18:41,990 --> 01:18:42,000
was
 

4123
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,149
was
the the the speaker saying i accept the

4124
01:18:44,149 --> 01:18:44,159
the the the speaker saying i accept the
 

4125
01:18:44,159 --> 01:18:45,350
the the the speaker saying i accept the
universe

4126
01:18:45,350 --> 01:18:45,360
universe
 

4127
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:48,630
universe
and dr johnson said well he damn well

4128
01:18:48,630 --> 01:18:48,640
and dr johnson said well he damn well
 

4129
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:50,630
and dr johnson said well he damn well
better

4130
01:18:50,630 --> 01:18:50,640
better
 

4131
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:53,510
better
and and there's a certain uh there's a

4132
01:18:53,510 --> 01:18:53,520
and and there's a certain uh there's a
 

4133
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:55,590
and and there's a certain uh there's a
certain joy in accepting the universe

4134
01:18:55,590 --> 01:18:55,600
certain joy in accepting the universe
 

4135
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:57,669
certain joy in accepting the universe
because it's mind expanding

4136
01:18:57,669 --> 01:18:57,679
because it's mind expanding
 

4137
01:18:57,679 --> 01:19:01,430
because it's mind expanding
and uh

4138
01:19:01,430 --> 01:19:01,440

 

4139
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:05,830

you know it and to me complementarity

4140
01:19:05,830 --> 01:19:05,840
you know it and to me complementarity
 

4141
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:10,070
you know it and to me complementarity
also suggests tolerance

4142
01:19:10,070 --> 01:19:10,080
also suggests tolerance
 

4143
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:13,189
also suggests tolerance
suggests opportunities for understanding

4144
01:19:13,189 --> 01:19:13,199
suggests opportunities for understanding
 

4145
01:19:13,199 --> 01:19:15,750
suggests opportunities for understanding
different different understanding things

4146
01:19:15,750 --> 01:19:15,760
different different understanding things
 

4147
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:19,669
different different understanding things
in different ways that add

4148
01:19:19,669 --> 01:19:19,679

 

4149
01:19:19,679 --> 01:19:23,189

add to rather than detract from

4150
01:19:23,189 --> 01:19:23,199
add to rather than detract from
 

4151
01:19:23,199 --> 01:19:26,790
add to rather than detract from
uh understanding so uh i think it's it's

4152
01:19:26,790 --> 01:19:26,800
uh understanding so uh i think it's it's
 

4153
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:27,189
uh understanding so uh i think it's it's
an up

4154
01:19:27,189 --> 01:19:27,199
an up
 

4155
01:19:27,199 --> 01:19:29,910
an up
it's an opportunity for mind expansion

4156
01:19:29,910 --> 01:19:29,920
it's an opportunity for mind expansion
 

4157
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:30,470
it's an opportunity for mind expansion
and

4158
01:19:30,470 --> 01:19:30,480
and
 

4159
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:33,189
and
demanding that there's only one way to

01:19:33,189 --> 01:19:33,199
demanding that there's only one way to
 

4161
01:19:33,199 --> 01:19:34,950
demanding that there's only one way to
think about things

4162
01:19:34,950 --> 01:19:34,960
think about things
 

4163
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:37,350
think about things
can be very limiting and the free will

4164
01:19:37,350 --> 01:19:37,360
can be very limiting and the free will
 

4165
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:39,590
can be very limiting and the free will
one that's a trippy one though i think

4166
01:19:39,590 --> 01:19:39,600
one that's a trippy one though i think
 

4167
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:42,550
one that's a trippy one though i think
to think like i am the decider of my own

4168
01:19:42,550 --> 01:19:42,560
to think like i am the decider of my own
 

4169
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:43,350
to think like i am the decider of my own
actions

4170
01:19:43,350 --> 01:19:43,360
actions
 

4171
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:47,910
actions
and at the same time i'm not is uh

4172
01:19:47,910 --> 01:19:47,920
and at the same time i'm not is uh
 

4173
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:51,110
and at the same time i'm not is uh
is tricky to think about but it's there

4174
01:19:51,110 --> 01:19:51,120
is tricky to think about but it's there
 

4175
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:53,030
is tricky to think about but it's there
does seem to be some kind of profound

4176
01:19:53,030 --> 01:19:53,040
does seem to be some kind of profound
 

4177
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:53,750
does seem to be some kind of profound
truth in that

4178
01:19:53,750 --> 01:19:53,760
truth in that
 

4179
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:57,110
truth in that
i get well i think it is tied up it will

4180
01:19:57,110 --> 01:19:57,120
i get well i think it is tied up it will
 

4181
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:58,550
i get well i think it is tied up it will
turn out to be tied up when we

4182
01:19:58,550 --> 01:19:58,560
turn out to be tied up when we
 

4183
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:00,229
turn out to be tied up when we
understand things better

4184
01:20:00,229 --> 01:20:00,239
understand things better
 

4185
01:20:00,239 --> 01:20:02,950
understand things better
with these issues of self-awareness and

4186
01:20:02,950 --> 01:20:02,960
with these issues of self-awareness and
 

4187
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:03,590
with these issues of self-awareness and
i think so

4188
01:20:03,590 --> 01:20:03,600
i think so
 

4189
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:05,750
i think so
and where we get what what we perceive

4190
01:20:05,750 --> 01:20:05,760
and where we get what what we perceive
 

4191
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:07,590
and where we get what what we perceive
as making choices what does that really

4192
01:20:07,590 --> 01:20:07,600
as making choices what does that really
 

4193
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:08,470
as making choices what does that really
mean and

4194
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:08,480
mean and
 

4195
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:11,990
mean and
what's going on under the hood and

4196
01:20:11,990 --> 01:20:12,000
what's going on under the hood and
 

4197
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,310
what's going on under the hood and
but i'm i'm speculating about a future

4198
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:14,320
but i'm i'm speculating about a future
 

4199
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:16,229
but i'm i'm speculating about a future
understanding that's not in place

4200
01:20:16,229 --> 01:20:16,239
understanding that's not in place
 

4201
01:20:16,239 --> 01:20:18,229
understanding that's not in place
at present your sense there will always

4202
01:20:18,229 --> 01:20:18,239
at present your sense there will always
 

4203
01:20:18,239 --> 01:20:19,830
at present your sense there will always
be uh

4204
01:20:19,830 --> 01:20:19,840
be uh
 

4205
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:22,310
be uh
like as you dig into the self-awareness

4206
01:20:22,310 --> 01:20:22,320
like as you dig into the self-awareness
 

4207
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:23,590
like as you dig into the self-awareness
thing there'll always

4208
01:20:23,590 --> 01:20:23,600
thing there'll always
 

4209
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:25,510
thing there'll always
be some places where complementarity is

4210
01:20:25,510 --> 01:20:25,520
be some places where complementarity is
 

4211
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:27,510
be some places where complementarity is
going to show up oh definitely

4212
01:20:27,510 --> 01:20:27,520
going to show up oh definitely
 

4213
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:30,550
going to show up oh definitely
yeah i mean it will be uh

4214
01:20:30,550 --> 01:20:30,560
yeah i mean it will be uh
 

4215
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:32,229
yeah i mean it will be uh
how should i say there'll be kind of a

4216
01:20:32,229 --> 01:20:32,239
how should i say there'll be kind of a
 

4217
01:20:32,239 --> 01:20:33,590
how should i say there'll be kind of a
god's eye view

4218
01:20:33,590 --> 01:20:33,600
god's eye view
 

4219
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:37,270
god's eye view
which sees everything that's going on

4220
01:20:37,270 --> 01:20:37,280
which sees everything that's going on
 

4221
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:40,149
which sees everything that's going on
in the computer or the the brain and

4222
01:20:40,149 --> 01:20:40,159
in the computer or the the brain and
 

4223
01:20:40,159 --> 01:20:42,149
in the computer or the the brain and
then there's the brain's own view

4224
01:20:42,149 --> 01:20:42,159
then there's the brain's own view
 

4225
01:20:42,159 --> 01:20:44,950
then there's the brain's own view
or the or the central processor or

4226
01:20:44,950 --> 01:20:44,960
or the or the central processor or
 

4227
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:46,149
or the or the central processor or
whatever it is that's the

4228
01:20:46,149 --> 01:20:46,159
whatever it is that's the
 

4229
01:20:46,159 --> 01:20:49,350
whatever it is that's the
what we call the the the the self the

4230
01:20:49,350 --> 01:20:49,360
what we call the the the the self the
 

4231
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:50,629
what we call the the the the self the
consciousness

4232
01:20:50,629 --> 01:20:50,639
consciousness
 

4233
01:20:50,639 --> 01:20:52,550
consciousness
that's all only aware of a very small

4234
01:20:52,550 --> 01:20:52,560
that's all only aware of a very small
 

4235
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:54,550
that's all only aware of a very small
part of it and those are very different

4236
01:20:54,550 --> 01:20:54,560
part of it and those are very different
 

4237
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:58,070
part of it and those are very different
those are the the so uh the god's eye

4238
01:20:58,070 --> 01:20:58,080
those are the the so uh the god's eye
 

4239
01:20:58,080 --> 01:20:59,590
those are the the so uh the god's eye
view can be deterministic

4240
01:20:59,590 --> 01:20:59,600
view can be deterministic
 

4241
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:04,709
view can be deterministic
while the the the the self view

4242
01:21:04,709 --> 01:21:04,719
while the the the the self view
 

4243
01:21:04,719 --> 01:21:08,149
while the the the the self view
sees free will and that's i i'm pretty

4244
01:21:08,149 --> 01:21:08,159
sees free will and that's i i'm pretty
 

4245
01:21:08,159 --> 01:21:09,990
sees free will and that's i i'm pretty
sure that's how it's going to work out

4246
01:21:09,990 --> 01:21:10,000
sure that's how it's going to work out
 

4247
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,990
sure that's how it's going to work out
actually and but as it as it stands free

4248
01:21:13,990 --> 01:21:14,000
actually and but as it as it stands free
 

4249
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:14,310
actually and but as it as it stands free
will

4250
01:21:14,310 --> 01:21:14,320
will
 

4251
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:17,510
will
is a concept that we definitely at least

4252
01:21:17,510 --> 01:21:17,520
is a concept that we definitely at least
 

4253
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:19,350
is a concept that we definitely at least
i feel i definitely experience i can

4254
01:21:19,350 --> 01:21:19,360
i feel i definitely experience i can
 

4255
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:21,430
i feel i definitely experience i can
choose to do one thing than another

4256
01:21:21,430 --> 01:21:21,440
choose to do one thing than another
 

4257
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:23,189
choose to do one thing than another
and other people i think are

4258
01:21:23,189 --> 01:21:23,199
and other people i think are
 

4259
01:21:23,199 --> 01:21:25,189
and other people i think are
sufficiently similar to me that i

4260
01:21:25,189 --> 01:21:25,199
sufficiently similar to me that i
 

4261
01:21:25,199 --> 01:21:30,470
sufficiently similar to me that i
i trust that they feel the same way

4262
01:21:30,470 --> 01:21:30,480

 

4263
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:32,629

and it's an essential concept in

4264
01:21:32,629 --> 01:21:32,639
and it's an essential concept in
 

4265
01:21:32,639 --> 01:21:34,229
and it's an essential concept in
psychology and law

4266
01:21:34,229 --> 01:21:34,239
psychology and law
 

4267
01:21:34,239 --> 01:21:38,870
psychology and law
and so forth but uh

4268
01:21:38,870 --> 01:21:38,880
and so forth but uh
 

4269
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:40,709
and so forth but uh
at the same time i think that mind

4270
01:21:40,709 --> 01:21:40,719
at the same time i think that mind
 

4271
01:21:40,719 --> 01:21:42,390
at the same time i think that mind
emerges from matter

4272
01:21:42,390 --> 01:21:42,400
emerges from matter
 

4273
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:45,990
emerges from matter
and that there's an alternative

4274
01:21:45,990 --> 01:21:46,000
and that there's an alternative
 

4275
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:49,270
and that there's an alternative

uh really is deterministic let me ask

4282
01:21:56,470 --> 01:21:56,480
uh really is deterministic let me ask
 

4283
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:57,830
uh really is deterministic let me ask
you about some particles

4284
01:21:57,830 --> 01:21:57,840
you about some particles
 

4285
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:01,030
you about some particles
okay first the absurd question almost

uh we build the world out of particles

4358
01:23:25,189 --> 01:23:25,199
uh we build the world out of particles
 

4359
01:23:25,199 --> 01:23:26,390
uh we build the world out of particles
that are points

4360

that are points
 

4361
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:28,070
that are points
so do they actually exist and what are

4362
01:23:28,070 --> 01:23:28,080
so do they actually exist and what are
 

4363
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:29,910
so do they actually exist and what are
we talking about so like oh they exist

4364
01:23:29,910 --> 01:23:29,920
we talking about so like oh they exist
 

4365
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:32,870
we talking about so like oh they exist
so let me ask sort of uh do quarks exist

4366
01:23:32,870 --> 01:23:32,880
so let me ask sort of uh do quarks exist
 

4367
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:34,790
so let me ask sort of uh do quarks exist
yes

4368
01:23:34,790 --> 01:23:34,800
yes
 

4369
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:37,189
yes
two electrons exist yes two photons

4370
01:23:37,189 --> 01:23:37,199
two electrons exist yes two photons
 

4371
01:23:37,199 --> 01:23:37,830
two electrons exist yes two photons
exist yes

4372
01:23:37,830 --> 01:23:37,840
exist yes
 

4373
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:39,590
exist yes
but what does it mean for them to exist

4374
01:23:39,590 --> 01:23:39,600
but what does it mean for them to exist
 

4375
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:40,870
but what does it mean for them to exist
okay so well

4376
01:23:40,870 --> 01:23:40,880
okay so well
 

4377
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:43,990
okay so well
the hard answer to that the precise

4378
01:23:43,990 --> 01:23:44,000
the hard answer to that the precise
 

4379
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:44,629
the hard answer to that the precise
answer

4380
01:23:44,629 --> 01:23:44,639
answer
 

4381
01:23:44,639 --> 01:23:48,870
answer
is that uh we construct the world

4382
01:23:48,870 --> 01:23:48,880
is that uh we construct the world
 

4383
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:51,830
is that uh we construct the world
out of equations that contain entities

4384
01:23:51,830 --> 01:23:51,840
out of equations that contain entities
 

4385
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:53,030
out of equations that contain entities
that

4386
01:23:53,030 --> 01:23:53,040
that
 

4387
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:58,550
that
uh are reproducible that exist in

4388
01:23:58,550 --> 01:23:58,560
uh are reproducible that exist in
 

4389
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:01,750
uh are reproducible that exist in
vast numbers throughout the universe

4390
01:24:01,750 --> 01:24:01,760
vast numbers throughout the universe
 

4391
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:05,189
vast numbers throughout the universe
that have definite properties of

4392
01:24:05,189 --> 01:24:05,199
that have definite properties of
 

4393
01:24:05,199 --> 01:24:08,229
that have definite properties of
mass spin

4394
01:24:08,229 --> 01:24:08,239

 

4395
01:24:08,239 --> 01:24:12,070

and a few others that

4396
01:24:12,070 --> 01:24:12,080

 

4397
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:14,709

we call electrons and the what what an

4398
01:24:14,709 --> 01:24:14,719
we call electrons and the what what an
 

4399
01:24:14,719 --> 01:24:16,070
we call electrons and the what what an
electron is is defined

4400
01:24:16,070 --> 01:24:16,080
electron is is defined
 

4401
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:18,470
electron is is defined
by the equations that it satisfies

4402
01:24:18,470 --> 01:24:18,480
by the equations that it satisfies
 

4403
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:19,830
by the equations that it satisfies
theoretically

4404
01:24:19,830 --> 01:24:19,840
theoretically
 

4405
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:23,110
theoretically
and we find that there are many many

4406
01:24:23,110 --> 01:24:23,120
and we find that there are many many
 

4407
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:27,030
and we find that there are many many
exemplars of that of that entity

4408
01:24:27,030 --> 01:24:27,040
exemplars of that of that entity
 

4409
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:30,070
exemplars of that of that entity
in in the physical world so intellect in

4410
01:24:30,070 --> 01:24:30,080
in in the physical world so intellect in
 

4411
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:31,990
in in the physical world so intellect in
the case of electrons we can

4412
01:24:31,990 --> 01:24:32,000
the case of electrons we can
 

4413
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,629
the case of electrons we can
you know isolate them and study them in

4414
01:24:34,629 --> 01:24:34,639
you know isolate them and study them in
 

4415
01:24:34,639 --> 01:24:36,550
you know isolate them and study them in
individual ones in great detail

4416
01:24:36,550 --> 01:24:36,560
individual ones in great detail
 

4417
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:38,950
individual ones in great detail
and we can check that they all actually

4418
01:24:38,950 --> 01:24:38,960
and we can check that they all actually
 

4419
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:40,070
and we can check that they all actually
are

4420
01:24:40,070 --> 01:24:40,080
are
 

4421
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:43,350
are
identical and

4422
01:24:43,350 --> 01:24:43,360
identical and
 

4423
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:46,709
identical and
that's why chemistry works and yes so so

4424
01:24:46,709 --> 01:24:46,719
that's why chemistry works and yes so so
 

4425
01:24:46,719 --> 01:24:48,709
that's why chemistry works and yes so so
so that in that case uh it's very

4426
01:24:48,709 --> 01:24:48,719
so that in that case uh it's very
 

4427
01:24:48,719 --> 01:24:51,750
so that in that case uh it's very
tangible similarly with photons you can

4428
01:24:51,750 --> 01:24:51,760
tangible similarly with photons you can
 

4429
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:54,070
tangible similarly with photons you can
study them individually they're the

4430
01:24:54,070 --> 01:24:54,080
study them individually they're the
 

4431
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:55,510
study them individually they're the
units of light

4432
01:24:55,510 --> 01:24:55,520
units of light
 

4433
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:59,750
units of light
uh and uh nowadays it's very practical

4434
01:24:59,750 --> 01:24:59,760
uh and uh nowadays it's very practical
 

4435
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:01,510
uh and uh nowadays it's very practical
to study individual photons and

4436
01:25:01,510 --> 01:25:01,520
to study individual photons and
 

4437
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:02,790
to study individual photons and
determine their

4438
01:25:02,790 --> 01:25:02,800
determine their
 

4439
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:04,870
determine their
uh their spin and their other basic

4440
01:25:04,870 --> 01:25:04,880
uh their spin and their other basic
 

4441
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:06,070
uh their spin and their other basic
properties and

4442

our model of matter that's so successful
 

4455
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:23,430
our model of matter that's so successful

uh it's a little more complicated
 

4457
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:26,550
uh it's a little more complicated
because the quarks and gluons

4458
01:25:26,550 --> 01:25:26,560
because the quarks and gluons
 

4459
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:29,750
because the quarks and gluons
that appear in our equations don't

uh the behavior of quarks is complicated

4482
01:26:00,709 --> 01:26:00,719
uh the behavior of quarks is complicated
 

4483
01:26:00,719 --> 01:26:03,910
uh the behavior of quarks is complicated
at high energies they can prop they can

4484
01:26:03,910 --> 01:26:03,920
at high energies they can prop they can
 

4485
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:06,830
at high energies they can prop they can
propagate through space relatively

for a while and we can see their tracks
 

4491
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:14,070
for a while and we can see their tracks
so ultimately they get recaptured into

they propagate freely and while that
happens we can

01:26:24,070 --> 01:26:24,080
happens we can
 

4503
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:26,030
happens we can
take snapshots and see see their

you can't uh you can't isolate them as
 

4519
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:42,149
you can't uh you can't isolate them as
individual particles and study them in

01:26:42,149 --> 01:26:42,159
individual particles and study them in
 

4521
01:26:42,159 --> 01:26:43,830
individual particles and study them in
the same way we study electrons

the same way we study electrons
 

4523
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:47,990
the same way we study electrons
say uh you can

they
 

4545
01:27:12,159 --> 01:27:14,229
they
they they leave tracks and then you can

4546
01:27:14,229 --> 01:27:14,239
they they leave tracks and then you can
 

4547
01:27:14,239 --> 01:27:15,830
they they leave tracks and then you can
get convincing evidence that they were

4548
01:27:15,830 --> 01:27:15,840
get convincing evidence that they were
 

4549
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:16,629
get convincing evidence that they were
there and

4550
01:27:16,629 --> 01:27:16,639
there and
 

4551
01:27:16,639 --> 01:27:18,470
there and
and have the properties that that we

4552
01:27:18,470 --> 01:27:18,480
and have the properties that that we
 

4553
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:20,149
and have the properties that that we
wanted them to have can we talk about

4554
01:27:20,149 --> 01:27:20,159
wanted them to have can we talk about
 

4555
01:27:20,159 --> 01:27:22,310
wanted them to have can we talk about
asymptotic freedom this very idea that

you won the nobel prize for

4558
01:27:23,830 --> 01:27:23,840
you won the nobel prize for
 

4559
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:26,950
you won the nobel prize for
yeah so it describes a

4560
01:27:26,950 --> 01:27:26,960
yeah so it describes a
 

4561
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:30,310
yeah so it describes a
very weird effect to me uh

4562
01:27:30,310 --> 01:27:30,320
very weird effect to me uh
 

4563
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:33,270
very weird effect to me uh
the the weird in the following way so

4564
01:27:33,270 --> 01:27:33,280
the the weird in the following way so
 

4565
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:33,669
the the weird in the following way so
the

4566
01:27:33,669 --> 01:27:33,679
the
 

4567
01:27:33,679 --> 01:27:38,070
the
the the you know the way i think of most

4568
01:27:38,070 --> 01:27:38,080
the the you know the way i think of most
 

4569
01:27:38,080 --> 01:27:40,550
the the you know the way i think of most
forces or interactions the closer you

4570
01:27:40,550 --> 01:27:40,560
forces or interactions the closer you
 

4571
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:41,750
forces or interactions the closer you
are

4572
01:27:41,750 --> 01:27:41,760
are
 

4573
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:44,709
are
the stronger the effect the the stronger

4574
01:27:44,709 --> 01:27:44,719
the stronger the effect the the stronger
 

4575
01:27:44,719 --> 01:27:45,830
the stronger the effect the the stronger
the force yeah

4576
01:27:45,830 --> 01:27:45,840
the force yeah
 

4577
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:49,510
the force yeah
right with with quarks uh

4578
01:27:49,510 --> 01:27:49,520
right with with quarks uh
 

4579
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:52,470
right with with quarks uh
the closer they are the the less so the

4580
01:27:52,470 --> 01:27:52,480
the closer they are the the less so the
 

4581
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:53,910
the closer they are the the less so the
strong interaction

4582
01:27:53,910 --> 01:27:53,920
strong interaction
 

4583
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:57,830
strong interaction
and in fact they basically act like free

4584
01:27:57,830 --> 01:27:57,840
and in fact they basically act like free
 

4585
01:27:57,840 --> 01:27:59,830
and in fact they basically act like free
particles when they're

4586
01:27:59,830 --> 01:27:59,840
particles when they're
 

4587
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:02,070
particles when they're
very close that's right yes well but

4588
01:28:02,070 --> 01:28:02,080
very close that's right yes well but
 

4589
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:04,390
very close that's right yes well but
this requires a huge amount of energy

4590
01:28:04,390 --> 01:28:04,400
this requires a huge amount of energy
 

4591
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:08,310
this requires a huge amount of energy
like can you describe me um

4592
01:28:08,310 --> 01:28:08,320
like can you describe me um
 

4593
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:11,590
like can you describe me um
why how does this even work

4594
01:28:11,590 --> 01:28:11,600
why how does this even work
 

4595
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:14,790
why how does this even work
how weird it is proper description

4596
01:28:14,790 --> 01:28:14,800
how weird it is proper description
 

4597
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:18,229
how weird it is proper description
must bring in uh quantum mechanics and

4598
01:28:18,229 --> 01:28:18,239
must bring in uh quantum mechanics and
 

4599
01:28:18,239 --> 01:28:19,910
must bring in uh quantum mechanics and
relativity and

4600
01:28:19,910 --> 01:28:19,920
relativity and
 

4601
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:24,550
relativity and
it's uh so a proper description

4602
01:28:24,550 --> 01:28:24,560
it's uh so a proper description
 

4603
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:26,470
it's uh so a proper description
and equations so a proper description

4604
01:28:26,470 --> 01:28:26,480
and equations so a proper description
 

4605
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:28,070
and equations so a proper description
really is is probably

4606
01:28:28,070 --> 01:28:28,080
really is is probably
 

4607
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:30,790
really is is probably
uh more more more than we have time for

4608
01:28:30,790 --> 01:28:30,800
uh more more more than we have time for
 

4609
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:32,070
uh more more more than we have time for
and then

4610
01:28:32,070 --> 01:28:32,080
and then
 

4611
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:34,070
and then
uh we require quite a bit of patience on

4612
01:28:34,070 --> 01:28:34,080
uh we require quite a bit of patience on
 

4613
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:35,750
uh we require quite a bit of patience on
your part but uh

4614
01:28:35,750 --> 01:28:35,760
your part but uh
 

4615
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:37,830
your part but uh
how does relativity come into play wait

4616
01:28:37,830 --> 01:28:37,840
how does relativity come into play wait
 

4617
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:39,030
how does relativity come into play wait
wait

4618
01:28:39,030 --> 01:28:39,040
wait
 

4619
01:28:39,040 --> 01:28:42,550
wait
relativity is important because

4620
01:28:42,550 --> 01:28:42,560
relativity is important because
 

4621
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:48,870
relativity is important because
when when we talk about

4622
01:28:48,870 --> 01:28:48,880

 

4623
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:51,590

trying to think about short distances we

4624
01:28:51,590 --> 01:28:51,600
trying to think about short distances we
 

4625
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:53,669
trying to think about short distances we
have to think about

4626
01:28:53,669 --> 01:28:53,679
have to think about
 

4627
01:28:53,679 --> 01:28:55,830
have to think about
very large momenta and very large moment

4628
01:28:55,830 --> 01:28:55,840
very large momenta and very large moment
 

4629
01:28:55,840 --> 01:28:58,070
very large momenta and very large moment
are connected to very large energy

4630
01:28:58,070 --> 01:28:58,080
are connected to very large energy
 

4631
01:28:58,080 --> 01:29:00,229
are connected to very large energy
in relativity and so the connection

4632
01:29:00,229 --> 01:29:00,239
in relativity and so the connection
 

4633
01:29:00,239 --> 01:29:01,350
in relativity and so the connection
between

4634
01:29:01,350 --> 01:29:01,360
between
 

4635
01:29:01,360 --> 01:29:03,430
between
how things behave at short distances and

4636
01:29:03,430 --> 01:29:03,440
how things behave at short distances and
 

4637
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:05,750
how things behave at short distances and
how things behave at high energy

4638
01:29:05,750 --> 01:29:05,760
how things behave at high energy
 

4639
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:08,390
how things behave at high energy
uh really is connected through

4640
01:29:08,390 --> 01:29:08,400
uh really is connected through
 

4641
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:09,830
uh really is connected through
relativity in

4642
01:29:09,830 --> 01:29:09,840
relativity in
 

4643
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:12,870
relativity in
sort of a slightly backhanded way

4644
01:29:12,870 --> 01:29:12,880
sort of a slightly backhanded way
 

4645
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:15,990
sort of a slightly backhanded way
quantum mechanics indicates that short

4646
01:29:15,990 --> 01:29:16,000
quantum mechanics indicates that short
 

4647
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:19,430
quantum mechanics indicates that short
to get to analyze short distances

4648
01:29:19,430 --> 01:29:19,440
to get to analyze short distances
 

4649
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:22,790
to get to analyze short distances
uh you need to bring in probes

4650
01:29:22,790 --> 01:29:22,800
uh you need to bring in probes
 

4651
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:26,310
uh you need to bring in probes
that carry a lot of momentum

4652
01:29:26,310 --> 01:29:26,320
that carry a lot of momentum
 

4653
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:29,030
that carry a lot of momentum
this again is related to uncertainty

4654
01:29:29,030 --> 01:29:29,040
this again is related to uncertainty
 

4655
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:29,990
this again is related to uncertainty
because

4656
01:29:29,990 --> 01:29:30,000
because
 

4657
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:31,669
because
uh it's the fact that you have to bring

4658
01:29:31,669 --> 01:29:31,679
uh it's the fact that you have to bring
 

4659
01:29:31,679 --> 01:29:33,430
uh it's the fact that you have to bring
in a lot of momentum

4660
01:29:33,430 --> 01:29:33,440
in a lot of momentum
 

4661
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:36,350
in a lot of momentum
that interferes with the possibility of

4662
01:29:36,350 --> 01:29:36,360
that interferes with the possibility of
 

4663
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:38,149
that interferes with the possibility of
determining

4664
01:29:38,149 --> 01:29:38,159
determining
 

4665
01:29:38,159 --> 01:29:40,070
determining
position and momentum at the same time

4666
01:29:40,070 --> 01:29:40,080
position and momentum at the same time
 

4667
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:41,830
position and momentum at the same time
if you want to determine position

4668
01:29:41,830 --> 01:29:41,840
if you want to determine position
 

4669
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:43,590
if you want to determine position
you have to use instruments that bring

4670
01:29:43,590 --> 01:29:43,600
you have to use instruments that bring
 

4671
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:45,030
you have to use instruments that bring
in a lot of momentum

4672
01:29:45,030 --> 01:29:45,040
in a lot of momentum
 

4673
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:47,910
in a lot of momentum
and because of that those same

4674
01:29:47,910 --> 01:29:47,920
and because of that those same
 

4675
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:49,830
and because of that those same
instruments can't also measure momentum

4676
01:29:49,830 --> 01:29:49,840
instruments can't also measure momentum
 

4677
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:53,510
instruments can't also measure momentum
because they're disturbing the momentum

4678
01:29:53,510 --> 01:29:53,520

 

4679
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:55,270

and then the momentum brings in energy

4680
01:29:55,270 --> 01:29:55,280
and then the momentum brings in energy
 

4681
01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:56,709
and then the momentum brings in energy
and yeah so

4682
01:29:56,709 --> 01:29:56,719
and yeah so
 

4683
01:29:56,719 --> 01:29:58,310
and yeah so
so that there's also the effect that

4684
01:29:58,310 --> 01:29:58,320
so that there's also the effect that
 

4685
01:29:58,320 --> 01:30:00,870
so that there's also the effect that
asymptotic freedom comes from

4686
01:30:00,870 --> 01:30:00,880
asymptotic freedom comes from
 

4687
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:05,430
asymptotic freedom comes from
uh the possibility of spontaneously

4688
01:30:05,430 --> 01:30:05,440
uh the possibility of spontaneously
 

4689
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:10,390
uh the possibility of spontaneously
making uh quarks and gluons

4690
01:30:10,390 --> 01:30:10,400
making uh quarks and gluons
 

4691
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:12,470
making uh quarks and gluons
for short amounts of time that that

4692
01:30:12,470 --> 01:30:12,480
for short amounts of time that that
 

4693
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:14,470
for short amounts of time that that
fluctuate into existence and out of

4694
01:30:14,470 --> 01:30:14,480
fluctuate into existence and out of
 

4695
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:15,669
fluctuate into existence and out of
existence

4696
01:30:15,669 --> 01:30:15,679
existence
 

4697
01:30:15,679 --> 01:30:18,790
existence
uh and uh the

4698
01:30:18,790 --> 01:30:18,800
uh and uh the
 

4699
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:22,310
uh and uh the
fact that that can be done with a very

4700
01:30:22,310 --> 01:30:22,320
fact that that can be done with a very
 

4701
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:23,669
fact that that can be done with a very
little amount of energy

4702
01:30:23,669 --> 01:30:23,679
little amount of energy
 

4703
01:30:23,679 --> 01:30:25,990
little amount of energy
and and uncertainty and energy

4704
01:30:25,990 --> 01:30:26,000
and and uncertainty and energy
 

4705
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:27,910
and and uncertainty and energy
translates into uncertainty in time so

4706
01:30:27,910 --> 01:30:27,920
translates into uncertainty in time so
 

4707
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:30,070
translates into uncertainty in time so
if you do that for a short time you can

4708
01:30:30,070 --> 01:30:30,080
if you do that for a short time you can
 

4709
01:30:30,080 --> 01:30:31,270
if you do that for a short time you can
do that uh

4710
01:30:31,270 --> 01:30:31,280
do that uh
 

4711
01:30:31,280 --> 01:30:33,910
do that uh
well it's all it comes in a package and

4712
01:30:33,910 --> 01:30:33,920
well it's all it comes in a package and
 

4713
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:34,629
well it's all it comes in a package and
you can

4714
01:30:34,629 --> 01:30:34,639
you can
 

4715
01:30:34,639 --> 01:30:37,270
you can
you can so uh i told you it would take a

4716
01:30:37,270 --> 01:30:37,280
you can so uh i told you it would take a
 

4717
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:39,350
you can so uh i told you it would take a
while to really uh to really explain

4718
01:30:39,350 --> 01:30:39,360
while to really uh to really explain
 

4719
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:42,550
while to really uh to really explain
but the uh but but

4720
01:30:42,550 --> 01:30:42,560
but the uh but but
 

4721
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:44,310
but the uh but but
the results can be understood i mean we

4722
01:30:44,310 --> 01:30:44,320
the results can be understood i mean we
 

4723
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:45,830
the results can be understood i mean we
can state the results

4724
01:30:45,830 --> 01:30:45,840
can state the results
 

4725
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:50,470
can state the results
uh pretty simply i think so uh

4726
01:30:50,470 --> 01:30:50,480
uh pretty simply i think so uh
 

4727
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:53,750
uh pretty simply i think so uh
in everyday life we do encounter some

4728
01:30:53,750 --> 01:30:53,760
in everyday life we do encounter some
 

4729
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:56,629
in everyday life we do encounter some
forces that increase with distance and

4730
01:30:56,629 --> 01:30:56,639
forces that increase with distance and
 

4731
01:30:56,639 --> 01:30:57,270
forces that increase with distance and
kind of

4732
01:30:57,270 --> 01:30:57,280
kind of
 

4733
01:30:57,280 --> 01:30:59,590
kind of
turn off at short distances that's the

4734
01:30:59,590 --> 01:30:59,600
turn off at short distances that's the
 

4735
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:01,510
turn off at short distances that's the
way rubber bands work if you think about

4736
01:31:01,510 --> 01:31:01,520
way rubber bands work if you think about
 

4737
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:03,030
way rubber bands work if you think about
it or

4738
01:31:03,030 --> 01:31:03,040
it or
 

4739
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:05,830
it or
you if you pull them hard they they

4740
01:31:05,830 --> 01:31:05,840
you if you pull them hard they they
 

4741
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:06,550
you if you pull them hard they they
resist and

4742
01:31:06,550 --> 01:31:06,560
resist and
 

4743
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:09,590
resist and
but but they get flabby if if if the

4744
01:31:09,590 --> 01:31:09,600
but but they get flabby if if if the
 

4745
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:10,709
but but they get flabby if if if the
rubber band is not

4746
01:31:10,709 --> 01:31:10,719
rubber band is not
 

4747
01:31:10,719 --> 01:31:14,470
rubber band is not
not pulled uh and so there are

4748
01:31:14,470 --> 01:31:14,480
not pulled uh and so there are
 

4749
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:17,430
not pulled uh and so there are
that can happen uh in the physical world

4750
01:31:17,430 --> 01:31:17,440
that can happen uh in the physical world
 

4751
01:31:17,440 --> 01:31:19,430
that can happen uh in the physical world
but what's what's really difficult is to

4752
01:31:19,430 --> 01:31:19,440
but what's what's really difficult is to
 

4753
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:21,270
but what's what's really difficult is to
see how that could be a fundamental

4754
01:31:21,270 --> 01:31:21,280
see how that could be a fundamental
 

4755
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:23,030
see how that could be a fundamental
force that's consistent with everything

4756
01:31:23,030 --> 01:31:23,040
force that's consistent with everything
 

4757
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:24,310
force that's consistent with everything
else we know

4758
01:31:24,310 --> 01:31:24,320
else we know
 

4759
01:31:24,320 --> 01:31:28,149
else we know
and that that's what asymptotic freedom

4760
01:31:28,149 --> 01:31:28,159
and that that's what asymptotic freedom
 

4761
01:31:28,159 --> 01:31:30,390
and that that's what asymptotic freedom
is it says that uh

4762
01:31:30,390 --> 01:31:30,400
is it says that uh
 

4763
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:32,229
is it says that uh
there are particular there's a very

4764
01:31:32,229 --> 01:31:32,239
there are particular there's a very
 

4765
01:31:32,239 --> 01:31:33,910
there are particular there's a very
particular kind of

4766
01:31:33,910 --> 01:31:33,920
particular kind of
 

4767
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:36,790
particular kind of
fundamental force that involves special

4768
01:31:36,790 --> 01:31:36,800
fundamental force that involves special
 

4769
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:38,629
fundamental force that involves special
particles called gluons with very

special properties
 

4773
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:44,629
special properties
that uh enables that kind of behavior so

01:31:44,629 --> 01:31:44,639
that uh enables that kind of behavior so
 

4775
01:31:44,639 --> 01:31:46,550
that uh enables that kind of behavior so
ex there were experiments at the time we

4776
01:31:46,550 --> 01:31:46,560
ex there were experiments at the time we
 

4777
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:48,229
ex there were experiments at the time we
did our work there were experimental

4778
01:31:48,229 --> 01:31:48,239
did our work there were experimental
 

4779
01:31:48,239 --> 01:31:49,110
did our work there were experimental
indications

4780
01:31:49,110 --> 01:31:49,120
indications
 

4781
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:52,470
indications
that quarks and gluons

4782
01:31:52,470 --> 01:31:52,480
that quarks and gluons
 

4783
01:31:52,480 --> 01:31:55,270
that quarks and gluons
did have this kind of property but uh

4784
01:31:55,270 --> 01:31:55,280
did have this kind of property but uh
 

4785
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:56,950
did have this kind of property but uh
there were no equations that were

4786
01:31:56,950 --> 01:31:56,960
there were no equations that were
 

4787
01:31:56,960 --> 01:31:58,149
there were no equations that were
capable of

4788
01:31:58,149 --> 01:31:58,159
capable of
 

4789
01:31:58,159 --> 01:32:01,189
capable of
capturing it and we found the equations

4790
01:32:01,189 --> 01:32:01,199
capturing it and we found the equations
 

4791
01:32:01,199 --> 01:32:03,030
capturing it and we found the equations
and showed how they work and showed how

4792
01:32:03,030 --> 01:32:03,040
and showed how they work and showed how
 

4793
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:04,550
and showed how they work and showed how
they that they were

4794
01:32:04,550 --> 01:32:04,560
they that they were
 

4795
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:07,350
they that they were
basically unique and this led to a

4796
01:32:07,350 --> 01:32:07,360
basically unique and this led to a
 

4797
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:08,870
basically unique and this led to a
complete theory of how the strong

4798
01:32:08,870 --> 01:32:08,880
complete theory of how the strong
 

4799
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:10,790
complete theory of how the strong
interaction works which is

4800
01:32:10,790 --> 01:32:10,800
interaction works which is
 

4801
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:13,030
interaction works which is
the quantum chromodynamics uh we

4802
01:32:13,030 --> 01:32:13,040
the quantum chromodynamics uh we
 

4803
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:14,550
the quantum chromodynamics uh we
mentioned earlier

4804
01:32:14,550 --> 01:32:14,560
mentioned earlier
 

4805
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:18,070
mentioned earlier
and so uh

4806
01:32:18,070 --> 01:32:18,080
and so uh
 

4807
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:20,550
and so uh
so that's the phenomenon that that

4808
01:32:20,550 --> 01:32:20,560
so that's the phenomenon that that
 

4809
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:21,430
so that's the phenomenon that that
quarks

4810
01:32:21,430 --> 01:32:21,440
quarks
 

4811
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:24,550
quarks
and gluons interact very very weakly

4812
01:32:24,550 --> 01:32:24,560
and gluons interact very very weakly
 

4813
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:26,390
and gluons interact very very weakly
when they're close together

4814
01:32:26,390 --> 01:32:26,400
when they're close together
 

4815
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:29,189
when they're close together
that's connected through relativity with

4816
01:32:29,189 --> 01:32:29,199
that's connected through relativity with
 

4817
01:32:29,199 --> 01:32:30,149
that's connected through relativity with
the fact that they

4818
01:32:30,149 --> 01:32:30,159
the fact that they
 

4819
01:32:30,159 --> 01:32:32,870
the fact that they
also interact very very weakly at high

4820
01:32:32,870 --> 01:32:32,880
also interact very very weakly at high
 

4821
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:33,830
also interact very very weakly at high
energies

4822
01:32:33,830 --> 01:32:33,840
energies
 

4823
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:37,590
energies
so if you have so at high energies

4824
01:32:37,590 --> 01:32:37,600
so if you have so at high energies
 

4825
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:39,430
so if you have so at high energies
the simplicity of the fundamental

4826
01:32:39,430 --> 01:32:39,440
the simplicity of the fundamental
 

4827
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:41,750
the simplicity of the fundamental
interaction gets revealed

4828
01:32:41,750 --> 01:32:41,760
interaction gets revealed
 

4829
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:44,149
interaction gets revealed
you know at the time we did our work the

4830
01:32:44,149 --> 01:32:44,159
you know at the time we did our work the
 

4831
01:32:44,159 --> 01:32:46,470
you know at the time we did our work the
clues were very subtle

4832
01:32:46,470 --> 01:32:46,480
clues were very subtle
 

4833
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:48,950
clues were very subtle
but nowadays at hot at what are now high

4834
01:32:48,950 --> 01:32:48,960
but nowadays at hot at what are now high
 

4835
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:51,030
but nowadays at hot at what are now high
energy accelerators it's all obvious

4836
01:32:51,030 --> 01:32:51,040
energy accelerators it's all obvious
 

4837
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:52,950
energy accelerators it's all obvious
so we would have had a much well

4838
01:32:52,950 --> 01:32:52,960
so we would have had a much well
 

4839
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:54,390
so we would have had a much well
somebody would have had a much easier

4840
01:32:54,390 --> 01:32:54,400
somebody would have had a much easier
 

4841
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:55,350
somebody would have had a much easier
time

4842
01:32:55,350 --> 01:32:55,360
time
 

4843
01:32:55,360 --> 01:32:57,590
time
20 years later looking at the data you

4844
01:32:57,590 --> 01:32:57,600
20 years later looking at the data you
 

4845
01:32:57,600 --> 01:32:59,830
20 years later looking at the data you
can sort of see the quarks and gluons

4846
01:32:59,830 --> 01:32:59,840
can sort of see the quarks and gluons
 

4847
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:01,510
can sort of see the quarks and gluons
as i mentioned they leave these short

4848
01:33:01,510 --> 01:33:01,520
as i mentioned they leave these short
 

4849
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:03,590
as i mentioned they leave these short
tracks that uh it would have been much

4850
01:33:03,590 --> 01:33:03,600
tracks that uh it would have been much
 

4851
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:04,870
tracks that uh it would have been much
much easier but but

4852
01:33:04,870 --> 01:33:04,880
much easier but but
 

4853
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:08,550
much easier but but
we from fundamental from indirect clues

4854
01:33:08,550 --> 01:33:08,560
we from fundamental from indirect clues
 

4855
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:10,149
we from fundamental from indirect clues
we were able to piece together enough

4856
01:33:10,149 --> 01:33:10,159
we were able to piece together enough
 

4857
01:33:10,159 --> 01:33:13,110
we were able to piece together enough
to make that behavior a prediction

4858
01:33:13,110 --> 01:33:13,120
to make that behavior a prediction
 

4859
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:14,550
to make that behavior a prediction
rather than a

4860
01:33:14,550 --> 01:33:14,560
rather than a
 

4861
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:16,709
rather than a
post-diction right so it becomes obvious

4862
01:33:16,709 --> 01:33:16,719
post-diction right so it becomes obvious
 

4863
01:33:16,719 --> 01:33:17,830
post-diction right so it becomes obvious
at high energies

4864
01:33:17,830 --> 01:33:17,840
at high energies
 

4865
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:19,910
at high energies
it becomes very obvious when when we

4866
01:33:19,910 --> 01:33:19,920
it becomes very obvious when when we
 

4867
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:21,430
it becomes very obvious when when we
first did this work

4868
01:33:21,430 --> 01:33:21,440
first did this work
 

4869
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:24,070
first did this work
it was uh frontiers of high energy

4870
01:33:24,070 --> 01:33:24,080
it was uh frontiers of high energy

and at big international conferences
there would always be sessions on

01:33:29,430 --> 01:33:29,440
there would always be sessions on
 

4877
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:32,709
there would always be sessions on

but
 

4889
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:44,709
but
nowadays the same kind of work

01:33:44,709 --> 01:33:44,719
nowadays the same kind of work
 

4891
01:33:44,719 --> 01:33:47,830
nowadays the same kind of work
but much more precise with

because
it's because people take this for

01:34:34,550 --> 01:34:34,560
the interaction between quarks within
 

4939
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:35,270
the interaction between quarks within
protons

4940
01:34:35,270 --> 01:34:35,280
protons
 

4941
01:34:35,280 --> 01:34:39,030
protons
well quarks and gluons have the same

4942
01:34:39,030 --> 01:34:39,040
well quarks and gluons have the same
 

4943
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:40,790
well quarks and gluons have the same
relation

4944
01:34:40,790 --> 01:34:40,800
relation
 

4945
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:44,870
relation
basically to nuclear physics as

4946
01:34:44,870 --> 01:34:44,880
basically to nuclear physics as
 

4947
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:48,070
basically to nuclear physics as
electrons and photons have to atomic and

4948
01:34:48,070 --> 01:34:48,080
electrons and photons have to atomic and
 

4949
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:49,669
electrons and photons have to atomic and
molecular physics

4950
01:34:49,669 --> 01:34:49,679
molecular physics
 

4951
01:34:49,679 --> 01:34:54,390
molecular physics
so atoms and photons

4952
01:34:54,390 --> 01:34:54,400
so atoms and photons
 

4953
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:57,350
so atoms and photons
are the dynamic entities that really

4954
01:34:57,350 --> 01:34:57,360
are the dynamic entities that really
 

4955
01:34:57,360 --> 01:35:00,070
are the dynamic entities that really
come into play in chemistry and

4956
01:35:00,070 --> 01:35:00,080
come into play in chemistry and
 

4957
01:35:00,080 --> 01:35:02,070
come into play in chemistry and
atomic physics of course you have to add

4958
01:35:02,070 --> 01:35:02,080
atomic physics of course you have to add
 

4959
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:03,990
atomic physics of course you have to add
the atomic nuclei but those are

4960
01:35:03,990 --> 01:35:04,000
the atomic nuclei but those are
 

4961
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:07,350
the atomic nuclei but those are
small and relatively inert really the

4962
01:35:07,350 --> 01:35:07,360
small and relatively inert really the
 

4963
01:35:07,360 --> 01:35:08,229
small and relatively inert really the
dynamical

4964
01:35:08,229 --> 01:35:08,239
dynamical
 

4965
01:35:08,239 --> 01:35:11,350
dynamical
part and you know for for most purposes

4966
01:35:11,350 --> 01:35:11,360
part and you know for for most purposes
 

4967
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:12,550
part and you know for for most purposes
of chemistry you just say

4968
01:35:12,550 --> 01:35:12,560
of chemistry you just say
 

4969
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:14,709
of chemistry you just say
you have this tiny little nucleus which

4970
01:35:14,709 --> 01:35:14,719
you have this tiny little nucleus which
 

4971
01:35:14,719 --> 01:35:15,669
you have this tiny little nucleus which
this which

4972
01:35:15,669 --> 01:35:15,679
this which
 

4973
01:35:15,679 --> 01:35:17,910
this which
qcd gives you don't worry about it it

4974
01:35:17,910 --> 01:35:17,920
qcd gives you don't worry about it it
 

4975
01:35:17,920 --> 01:35:19,510
qcd gives you don't worry about it it
just it's there

4976
01:35:19,510 --> 01:35:19,520
just it's there
 

4977
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:21,189
just it's there
the real the real action is the

4978
01:35:21,189 --> 01:35:21,199
the real the real action is the
 

4979
01:35:21,199 --> 01:35:23,270
the real the real action is the
electrons moving around and exchanging

4980
01:35:23,270 --> 01:35:23,280
electrons moving around and exchanging
 

4981
01:35:23,280 --> 01:35:24,149
electrons moving around and exchanging
and things like that

4982
01:35:24,149 --> 01:35:24,159
and things like that
 

4983
01:35:24,159 --> 01:35:27,590
and things like that
uh the uh but okay but we wanted to

4984
01:35:27,590 --> 01:35:27,600
uh the uh but okay but we wanted to
 

4985
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:27,990
uh the uh but okay but we wanted to
understand

4986
01:35:27,990 --> 01:35:28,000
understand
 

4987
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:31,669
understand
the nucleus too and uh

4988
01:35:31,669 --> 01:35:31,679
the nucleus too and uh
 

4989
01:35:31,679 --> 01:35:34,709
the nucleus too and uh
so atoms base are sort of quantum

4990
01:35:34,709 --> 01:35:34,719
so atoms base are sort of quantum
 

4991
01:35:34,719 --> 01:35:36,790
so atoms base are sort of quantum
mechanical clouds of electrons

4992
01:35:36,790 --> 01:35:36,800
mechanical clouds of electrons
 

4993
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:38,870
mechanical clouds of electrons
held together by electrical forces which

4994
01:35:38,870 --> 01:35:38,880
held together by electrical forces which
 

4995
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:40,790
held together by electrical forces which
is photons and then this radiation which

4996
01:35:40,790 --> 01:35:40,800
is photons and then this radiation which
 

4997
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:41,669
is photons and then this radiation which
is also

4998
01:35:41,669 --> 01:35:41,679
is also
 

4999
01:35:41,679 --> 01:35:43,510
is also
another aspect of photons that's where

5000
01:35:43,510 --> 01:35:43,520
another aspect of photons that's where
 

5001
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:45,189
another aspect of photons that's where
all the fun happens is the electrons and

5002
01:35:45,189 --> 01:35:45,199
all the fun happens is the electrons and
 

5003
01:35:45,199 --> 01:35:45,830
all the fun happens is the electrons and
the photons

5004
01:35:45,830 --> 01:35:45,840
the photons
 

5005
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:47,590
the photons
yeah that's right and the nuclei the

5006
01:35:47,590 --> 01:35:47,600
yeah that's right and the nuclei the
 

5007
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:49,189
yeah that's right and the nuclei the
nucleus are kind of the

5008
01:35:49,189 --> 01:35:49,199
nucleus are kind of the
 

5009
01:35:49,199 --> 01:35:52,470
nucleus are kind of the
the uh well they're necessary they give

5010
01:35:52,470 --> 01:35:52,480
the uh well they're necessary they give
 

5011
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:53,750
the uh well they're necessary they give
the positive charge

5012
01:35:53,750 --> 01:35:53,760
the positive charge
 

5013
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:56,870
the positive charge
and most of the mass of matter

5014
01:35:56,870 --> 01:35:56,880
and most of the mass of matter
 

5015
01:35:56,880 --> 01:36:00,070
and most of the mass of matter
but they don't since

5016
01:36:00,070 --> 01:36:00,080
but they don't since
 

5017
01:36:00,080 --> 01:36:01,750
but they don't since
since they're so heavy they don't move

5018
01:36:01,750 --> 01:36:01,760
since they're so heavy they don't move
 

5019
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:03,750
since they're so heavy they don't move
very much in chemistry

very much in chemistry
 

5021
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:07,270
very much in chemistry
and uh uh i'm oversimplifying

01:36:07,270 --> 01:36:07,280
and uh uh i'm oversimplifying
 

5023
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:08,629
and uh uh i'm oversimplifying
drastically they're not contributing

5024
01:36:08,629 --> 01:36:08,639
drastically they're not contributing
 

5025
01:36:08,639 --> 01:36:12,070
drastically they're not contributing
much of the interaction and

5027
01:36:12,080 --> 01:36:13,750

for most purposes in chemistry you can

5028
01:36:13,750 --> 01:36:13,760
for most purposes in chemistry you can
 

5029
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:16,070
for most purposes in chemistry you can
just idealize them as concentrations of

01:36:16,070 --> 01:36:16,080
just idealize them as concentrations of
 

5031
01:36:16,080 --> 01:36:17,990
just idealize them as concentrations of
positive mass and charge that

positive mass and charge that
 

5033
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:21,430

in the case of protons and neutrons it

5104
01:37:43,430 --> 01:37:43,440
in the case of protons and neutrons it
 

5105
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:45,270
in the case of protons and neutrons it
gives you atomic nuclei

5106
01:37:45,270 --> 01:37:45,280
gives you atomic nuclei
 

5107
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:48,229
gives you atomic nuclei
so again for definitional purposes uh

5108
01:37:48,229 --> 01:37:48,239
so again for definitional purposes uh
 

5109
01:37:48,239 --> 01:37:48,950
so again for definitional purposes uh
qcd

5110
01:37:48,950 --> 01:37:48,960

5111
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:51,669

quantum chromodynamics is basically the

5112
01:37:51,669 --> 01:37:51,679
quantum chromodynamics is basically the
 

5113
01:37:51,679 --> 01:37:52,310
quantum chromodynamics is basically the
physics

5114
01:37:52,310 --> 01:37:52,320
physics
 

5115
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:55,030
physics
of strong interaction yeah we understand

5116
01:37:55,030 --> 01:37:55,040
of strong interaction yeah we understand
 

5117
01:37:55,040 --> 01:37:56,470
of strong interaction yeah we understand
we now would unders which

5118
01:37:56,470 --> 01:37:56,480
we now would unders which
 

5119
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:58,550
we now would unders which
i think most physicists would would say

5120
01:37:58,550 --> 01:37:58,560
i think most physicists would would say
 

5121
01:37:58,560 --> 01:38:00,790
i think most physicists would would say
it's the theory of

5122
01:38:00,790 --> 01:38:00,800
it's the theory of
 

5123
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:04,070
it's the theory of
quarks and gluons and how they interact

5124
01:38:04,070 --> 01:38:04,080
quarks and gluons and how they interact
 

5125
01:38:04,080 --> 01:38:07,270
quarks and gluons and how they interact
but it's a very precise and i think it's

5126
01:38:07,270 --> 01:38:07,280
but it's a very precise and i think it's
 

5127
01:38:07,280 --> 01:38:08,629
but it's a very precise and i think it's
fair to say very beautiful

5128
01:38:08,629 --> 01:38:08,639
fair to say very beautiful
 

5129
01:38:08,639 --> 01:38:11,910
fair to say very beautiful
theory based on mathematical symmetry of

a high
order uh and another thing that's

5134
01:38:15,990 --> 01:38:16,000
order uh and another thing that's
 

5135
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:17,270
order uh and another thing that's
beautiful about it is

5136
01:38:17,270 --> 01:38:17,280
beautiful about it is
 

5137
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:21,990
beautiful about it is
that it's kind of

5138
01:38:21,990 --> 01:38:22,000

 

5139
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:26,229

in the same family as electrodynamics

01:38:26,229 --> 01:38:26,239
in the same family as electrodynamics

01:38:26,239 --> 01:38:29,350
in the same family as electrodynamics
the conceptual structure of this of the

01:38:29,350 --> 01:38:29,360
the conceptual structure of this of the
 

5143
01:38:29,360 --> 01:38:31,590
the conceptual structure of this of the
equations are very similar they're based

5144
01:38:31,590 --> 01:38:31,600
equations are very similar they're based
 

5145
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:32,470
equations are very similar they're based
on having

5146
01:38:32,470 --> 01:38:32,480
on having
 

5147
01:38:32,480 --> 01:38:35,430
on having
particles that respond to charge in a

5148
01:38:35,430 --> 01:38:35,440
particles that respond to charge in a
 

5149
01:38:35,440 --> 01:38:37,030
particles that respond to charge in a
very symmetric way

5150
01:38:37,030 --> 01:38:37,040
very symmetric way
 

5151
01:38:37,040 --> 01:38:39,750
very symmetric way
in the case of electrodynamics it's

5152
01:38:39,750 --> 01:38:39,760
in the case of electrodynamics it's
 

5153
01:38:39,760 --> 01:38:41,910
in the case of electrodynamics it's
photons that respond to electric charge

5154
01:38:41,910 --> 01:38:41,920
photons that respond to electric charge
 

5155
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:43,030
photons that respond to electric charge
in the case of

5156
01:38:43,030 --> 01:38:43,040
in the case of
 

5157
01:38:43,040 --> 01:38:44,870
in the case of
quantum chromodynamics there are three

5158
01:38:44,870 --> 01:38:44,880
quantum chromodynamics there are three
 

5159
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:47,430
quantum chromodynamics there are three
kinds of charge that we call colors

5160
01:38:47,430 --> 01:38:47,440
kinds of charge that we call colors
 

5161
01:38:47,440 --> 01:38:49,350
kinds of charge that we call colors
but they're nothing like colors they

5162
01:38:49,350 --> 01:38:49,360
but they're nothing like colors they
 

5163
01:38:49,360 --> 01:38:50,870
but they're nothing like colors they
really are like different kinds of

5164
01:38:50,870 --> 01:38:50,880
really are like different kinds of
 

5165
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:51,669
really are like different kinds of
charge

5166
01:38:51,669 --> 01:38:51,679
charge
 

5167
01:38:51,679 --> 01:38:54,310
charge
but they rhyme with the same kind of uh

5168
01:38:54,310 --> 01:38:54,320
but they rhyme with the same kind of uh
 

5169
01:38:54,320 --> 01:38:56,470
but they rhyme with the same kind of uh
like it's similar kind of dynamics

5170
01:38:56,470 --> 01:38:56,480
like it's similar kind of dynamics
 

5171
01:38:56,480 --> 01:38:59,030
like it's similar kind of dynamics
similar kind of dynamics i call i say i

5172
01:38:59,030 --> 01:38:59,040
similar kind of dynamics i call i say i
 

5173
01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:00,709
similar kind of dynamics i call i say i
like to say that qcd is like

5174
01:39:00,709 --> 01:39:00,719
like to say that qcd is like
 

5175
01:39:00,719 --> 01:39:03,750
like to say that qcd is like
qed on steroids and instead of one

5176
01:39:03,750 --> 01:39:03,760
qed on steroids and instead of one
 

5177
01:39:03,760 --> 01:39:06,310
qed on steroids and instead of one
photon you have eight gluons instead of

5178
01:39:06,310 --> 01:39:06,320
photon you have eight gluons instead of
 

5179
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:09,030
photon you have eight gluons instead of
one charge you have three color charges

5180
01:39:09,030 --> 01:39:09,040
one charge you have three color charges
 

5181
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:13,030
one charge you have three color charges
but there's a strong family resemblance

5182
01:39:13,030 --> 01:39:13,040
but there's a strong family resemblance
 

5183
01:39:13,040 --> 01:39:16,470
but there's a strong family resemblance
but the context in which uh qcd does its

5184
01:39:16,470 --> 01:39:16,480
but the context in which uh qcd does its
 

5185
01:39:16,480 --> 01:39:17,430
but the context in which uh qcd does its
thing is it's

5186
01:39:17,430 --> 01:39:17,440
thing is it's
 

5187
01:39:17,440 --> 01:39:19,750
thing is it's
it's much higher energies like that's

5188
01:39:19,750 --> 01:39:19,760
it's much higher energies like that's
 

5189
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:20,709
it's much higher energies like that's
where it comes to wealth

5190
01:39:20,709 --> 01:39:20,719
where it comes to wealth
 

5191
01:39:20,719 --> 01:39:24,229
where it comes to wealth
it's a stronger force so that to

5192
01:39:24,229 --> 01:39:24,239
it's a stronger force so that to
 

5193
01:39:24,239 --> 01:39:27,270
it's a stronger force so that to
access how it's works and kind of pry

5194
01:39:27,270 --> 01:39:27,280
access how it's works and kind of pry
 

5195
01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:29,270
access how it's works and kind of pry
things apart you have to inject more

5196
01:39:29,270 --> 01:39:29,280
things apart you have to inject more
 

5197
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:30,229
things apart you have to inject more
energy

5198
01:39:30,229 --> 01:39:30,239
energy
 

5199
01:39:30,239 --> 01:39:33,830
energy
and so that that gives us um

5200
01:39:33,830 --> 01:39:33,840
and so that that gives us um
 

5201
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:37,430
and so that that gives us um
in some sense a hint of uh how things

5202
01:39:37,430 --> 01:39:37,440
in some sense a hint of uh how things
 

5203
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:40,070
in some sense a hint of uh how things
were in the earlier universe yeah well

5204
01:39:40,070 --> 01:39:40,080
were in the earlier universe yeah well
 

5205
01:39:40,080 --> 01:39:41,030
were in the earlier universe yeah well
in that regard

5206
01:39:41,030 --> 01:39:41,040
in that regard
 

5207
01:39:41,040 --> 01:39:43,109
in that regard
asymptotic freedom is a tremendous

5208
01:39:43,109 --> 01:39:43,119
asymptotic freedom is a tremendous
 

5209
01:39:43,119 --> 01:39:45,510
asymptotic freedom is a tremendous
blessing because it means

5210
01:39:45,510 --> 01:39:45,520
blessing because it means
 

5211
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:48,310
blessing because it means
things get simpler at high energy and

5212
01:39:48,310 --> 01:39:48,320
things get simpler at high energy and
 

5213
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:49,990
things get simpler at high energy and
the universe was born free

5214
01:39:49,990 --> 01:39:50,000
the universe was born free
 

5215
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,629
the universe was born free
born free that's very very good yes

5216
01:39:52,629 --> 01:39:52,639
born free that's very very good yes
 

5217
01:39:52,639 --> 01:39:54,229
born free that's very very good yes
chris was born so

5218
01:39:54,229 --> 01:39:54,239
chris was born so
 

5219
01:39:54,239 --> 01:39:56,870
chris was born so
so in atomic physics i mean a similar

5220
01:39:56,870 --> 01:39:56,880
so in atomic physics i mean a similar
 

5221
01:39:56,880 --> 01:39:59,350
so in atomic physics i mean a similar
thing happens in the theory of stars

5222
01:39:59,350 --> 01:39:59,360
thing happens in the theory of stars
 

5223
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:02,470
thing happens in the theory of stars
stars are hot enough that uh the

5224
01:40:02,470 --> 01:40:02,480
stars are hot enough that uh the
 

5225
01:40:02,480 --> 01:40:04,790
stars are hot enough that uh the
interactions between electrons and

5226
01:40:04,790 --> 01:40:04,800
interactions between electrons and
 

5227
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:06,310
interactions between electrons and
photons are

5228
01:40:06,310 --> 01:40:06,320
photons are
 

5229
01:40:06,320 --> 01:40:07,590
photons are
they're they're liberated they don't

5230
01:40:07,590 --> 01:40:07,600
they're they're liberated they don't
 

5231
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:09,510
they're they're liberated they don't
form atoms anymore they make a plasma

5232
01:40:09,510 --> 01:40:09,520
form atoms anymore they make a plasma
 

5233
01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:10,950
form atoms anymore they make a plasma
which in some ways is simpler to

5234
01:40:10,950 --> 01:40:10,960
which in some ways is simpler to
 

5235
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:12,149
which in some ways is simpler to
understand

5236
01:40:12,149 --> 01:40:12,159
understand
 

5237
01:40:12,159 --> 01:40:14,870
understand
you don't have complicated chemistry and

5238
01:40:14,870 --> 01:40:14,880
you don't have complicated chemistry and
 

5239
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:18,070
you don't have complicated chemistry and
in the early universe according to qcd

5240
01:40:18,070 --> 01:40:18,080
in the early universe according to qcd
 

5241
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:20,629
in the early universe according to qcd
similarly atomic nuclei dissolved into

5242
01:40:20,629 --> 01:40:20,639
similarly atomic nuclei dissolved into
 

5243
01:40:20,639 --> 01:40:21,669
similarly atomic nuclei dissolved into
the constituent

5244
01:40:21,669 --> 01:40:21,679
the constituent
 

5245
01:40:21,679 --> 01:40:23,270
the constituent
quarks and gluons which are moving

5246
01:40:23,270 --> 01:40:23,280
quarks and gluons which are moving
 

5247
01:40:23,280 --> 01:40:24,870
quarks and gluons which are moving
around very fast and

5248
01:40:24,870 --> 01:40:24,880
around very fast and
 

5249
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:26,870
around very fast and
interacting in relatively simple ways

5250
01:40:26,870 --> 01:40:26,880
interacting in relatively simple ways
 

5251
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:28,229
interacting in relatively simple ways
and so this

5252
01:40:28,229 --> 01:40:28,239
and so this
 

5253
01:40:28,239 --> 01:40:30,550
and so this
uh this opened up the early universe to

5254
01:40:30,550 --> 01:40:30,560
uh this opened up the early universe to
 

5255
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:32,070
uh this opened up the early universe to
scientific

cp problem
 

5267
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:46,390
cp problem
okay so uh let me start with what the

5268
01:40:46,390 --> 01:40:46,400
okay so uh let me start with what the
 

5269
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:48,310
okay so uh let me start with what the
strong cp problem is

5270
01:40:48,310 --> 01:40:48,320
strong cp problem is
 

5271
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:52,070
strong cp problem is
uh first of all well charge con

5272
01:40:52,070 --> 01:40:52,080
uh first of all well charge con
 

5273
01:40:52,080 --> 01:40:55,350
uh first of all well charge con
c is charge conjugation which is the

5274
01:40:55,350 --> 01:40:55,360
c is charge conjugation which is the
 

5275
01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:58,550
c is charge conjugation which is the
transformation uh the notional

5276
01:40:58,550 --> 01:40:58,560
transformation uh the notional
 

5277
01:40:58,560 --> 01:41:00,310
transformation uh the notional
transformation if you like that changes

5278
01:41:00,310 --> 01:41:00,320
transformation if you like that changes
 

5279
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:03,270
transformation if you like that changes
all particles into their anti-particles

5280
01:41:03,270 --> 01:41:03,280
all particles into their anti-particles
 

5281
01:41:03,280 --> 01:41:07,830
all particles into their anti-particles
and the concept of seek

5282
01:41:07,830 --> 01:41:07,840
and the concept of seek
 

5283
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:10,870
and the concept of seek
symmetry charge conjugation symmetry is

5284
01:41:10,870 --> 01:41:10,880
symmetry charge conjugation symmetry is
 

5285
01:41:10,880 --> 01:41:13,109
symmetry charge conjugation symmetry is
that if you do that

5286
01:41:13,109 --> 01:41:13,119
that if you do that
 

5287
01:41:13,119 --> 01:41:16,629
that if you do that
you find the same laws would work

5288
01:41:16,629 --> 01:41:16,639
you find the same laws would work
 

5289
01:41:16,639 --> 01:41:19,830
you find the same laws would work
so the laws are symmetric if

5290
01:41:19,830 --> 01:41:19,840
so the laws are symmetric if
 

5291
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:21,990
so the laws are symmetric if
the behavior that particles exhibit is

5292
01:41:21,990 --> 01:41:22,000
the behavior that particles exhibit is
 

5293
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:23,270
the behavior that particles exhibit is
the same as the part

5294
01:41:23,270 --> 01:41:23,280
the same as the part
 

5295
01:41:23,280 --> 01:41:25,990
the same as the part
as the behavior you get with all their

5296
01:41:25,990 --> 01:41:26,000
as the behavior you get with all their
 

5297
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:27,430
as the behavior you get with all their
anti-particles

01:41:27,430 --> 01:41:27,440
anti-particles
 

5299
01:41:27,440 --> 01:41:31,270
anti-particles
uh then p is parity

5300
01:41:31,270 --> 01:41:31,280
uh then p is parity
 

5301
01:41:31,280 --> 01:41:33,990
uh then p is parity
which is uh also called spatial

5302
01:41:33,990 --> 01:41:34,000
which is uh also called spatial
 

5303
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:35,189
which is uh also called spatial
inversion

5304
01:41:35,189 --> 01:41:35,199
inversion
 

5305
01:41:35,199 --> 01:41:37,510
inversion
it's basically looking at a mirror

5306
01:41:37,510 --> 01:41:37,520
it's basically looking at a mirror
 

5307
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:38,950
it's basically looking at a mirror

uh now in the mid 20th century
 

5327
01:42:00,239 --> 01:42:02,470
uh now in the mid 20th century
people discovered that both of those are

01:42:02,470 --> 01:42:02,480
people discovered that both of those are
 

5329
01:42:02,480 --> 01:42:03,990
people discovered that both of those are
not quite true

uh and interpret you could you would be
able to tell if you

01:42:27,350 --> 01:42:27,360
able to tell if you
 

5351
01:42:27,360 --> 01:42:29,030
able to tell if you
did the right kind of experiments which

5352
01:42:29,030 --> 01:42:29,040
did the right kind of experiments which
 

5353
01:42:29,040 --> 01:42:30,950
did the right kind of experiments which
was the mirror and which was the real

5357
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:35,510
thing
uh anyway that that's the parody and

5358
01:42:35,510 --> 01:42:35,520
uh anyway that that's the parody and
 

5359
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:36,629
uh anyway that that's the parody and
they show that

5360
01:42:36,629 --> 01:42:36,639
they show that
 

5361
01:42:36,639 --> 01:42:38,149
they show that
doesn't necessarily hold it doesn't

5362
01:42:38,149 --> 01:42:38,159
doesn't necessarily hold it doesn't
 

5363
01:42:38,159 --> 01:42:39,750
doesn't necessarily hold it doesn't
quite hold and that that oh

5364
01:42:39,750 --> 01:42:39,760
quite hold and that that oh
 

5365
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:43,109
quite hold and that that oh
that and examining uh

5366
01:42:43,109 --> 01:42:43,119
that and examining uh
 

5367
01:42:43,119 --> 01:42:45,510
that and examining uh
what the exceptions are turned out to be

5368
01:42:45,510 --> 01:42:45,520
what the exceptions are turned out to be
 

5369
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:47,750
what the exceptions are turned out to be
to lead to all kinds of insight about

5370
01:42:47,750 --> 01:42:47,760
to lead to all kinds of insight about
 

5371
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:49,669
to lead to all kinds of insight about
the nature of fundamental interactions

5372
01:42:49,669 --> 01:42:49,679
the nature of fundamental interactions
 

5373
01:42:49,679 --> 01:42:51,590
the nature of fundamental interactions
especially properties of neutrinos and

5374
01:42:51,590 --> 01:42:51,600
especially properties of neutrinos and
 

5375
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:53,590
especially properties of neutrinos and
the weak interaction it's a long story

5376
01:42:53,590 --> 01:42:53,600
the weak interaction it's a long story
 

5377
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:55,910
the weak interaction it's a long story
but it's a very it's a so you just

5378
01:42:55,910 --> 01:42:55,920
but it's a very it's a so you just
 

5379
01:42:55,920 --> 01:42:56,790
but it's a very it's a so you just
define the c

5380
01:42:56,790 --> 01:42:56,800
define the c
 

5381
01:42:56,800 --> 01:42:58,790
define the c
and the p the conjugation the charge

5382
01:42:58,790 --> 01:42:58,800
and the p the conjugation the charge
 

5383
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:00,149
and the p the conjugation the charge
conjugation now that i've done that i

5384
01:43:00,149 --> 01:43:00,159
conjugation now that i've done that i
 

5385
01:43:00,159 --> 01:43:00,790
conjugation now that i've done that i
want to

5386
01:43:00,790 --> 01:43:00,800
want to
 

5387
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:02,790
want to
what's the problem shove them off okay

5388
01:43:02,790 --> 01:43:02,800
what's the problem shove them off okay
 

5389
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:03,830
what's the problem shove them off okay
great

5390
01:43:03,830 --> 01:43:03,840
great
 

5391
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:06,470
great
because it's easier to talk about t

5392
01:43:06,470 --> 01:43:06,480
because it's easier to talk about t
 

5393
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:08,870
because it's easier to talk about t
which is time reversal symmetry

5394
01:43:08,870 --> 01:43:08,880
which is time reversal symmetry
 

5395
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:12,149
which is time reversal symmetry
we have very good reasons to think uh

5396
01:43:12,149 --> 01:43:12,159
we have very good reasons to think uh
 

5397
01:43:12,159 --> 01:43:15,510
we have very good reasons to think uh
cpt is a an accurate

5398
01:43:15,510 --> 01:43:15,520
cpt is a an accurate
 

5399
01:43:15,520 --> 01:43:17,910
cpt is a an accurate
symmetry of nature it's on the same

5400
01:43:17,910 --> 01:43:17,920
symmetry of nature it's on the same
 

5401
01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:19,669
symmetry of nature it's on the same
level as relativity and quantum

5402
01:43:19,669 --> 01:43:19,679
level as relativity and quantum
 

5403
01:43:19,679 --> 01:43:21,270
level as relativity and quantum
mechanics basically so

5404
01:43:21,270 --> 01:43:21,280
mechanics basically so
 

5405
01:43:21,280 --> 01:43:24,390
mechanics basically so
that better be true uh so it's

5406
01:43:24,390 --> 01:43:24,400
that better be true uh so it's
 

5407
01:43:24,400 --> 01:43:26,390
that better be true uh so it's
symmetric when you when you do

5408
01:43:26,390 --> 01:43:26,400
symmetric when you when you do
 

5409
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:27,910
symmetric when you when you do
conjugation parity in time

5410
01:43:27,910 --> 01:43:27,920
conjugation parity in time
 

5411
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:31,189
conjugation parity in time
and time and space reversal if you do

5412
01:43:31,189 --> 01:43:31,199
and time and space reversal if you do
 

5413
01:43:31,199 --> 01:43:32,229
and time and space reversal if you do
all three

5414
01:43:32,229 --> 01:43:32,239
all three
 

5415
01:43:32,239 --> 01:43:33,990
all three
then you get the same physical

5416
01:43:33,990 --> 01:43:34,000
then you get the same physical
 

5417
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:35,990
then you get the same physical
consequences now

5418
01:43:35,990 --> 01:43:36,000
consequences now
 

5419
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,629
consequences now
so but that means that cp is equivalent

5420
01:43:38,629 --> 01:43:38,639
so but that means that cp is equivalent
 

5421
01:43:38,639 --> 01:43:39,590
so but that means that cp is equivalent
to t

5422
01:43:39,590 --> 01:43:39,600
to t
 

5423
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:41,750
to t
but but what's observed in the world is

5424
01:43:41,750 --> 01:43:41,760
but but what's observed in the world is
 

5425
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:44,709
but but what's observed in the world is
that t is not quite an accurate symmetry

5426
01:43:44,709 --> 01:43:44,719
that t is not quite an accurate symmetry
 

5427
01:43:44,719 --> 01:43:45,510
that t is not quite an accurate symmetry
of nature

5428
01:43:45,510 --> 01:43:45,520
of nature
 

5429
01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:48,950
of nature
either so most phenomena

5430
01:43:48,950 --> 01:43:48,960
either so most phenomena
 

5431
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:52,149
either so most phenomena
uh of at the fundamental level

5432
01:43:52,149 --> 01:43:52,159
uh of at the fundamental level
 

5433
01:43:52,159 --> 01:43:53,910
uh of at the fundamental level
so interactions among elementary

5434
01:43:53,910 --> 01:43:53,920
so interactions among elementary
 

5435
01:43:53,920 --> 01:43:55,750
so interactions among elementary
particles and the basic

5436
01:43:55,750 --> 01:43:55,760
particles and the basic
 

5437
01:43:55,760 --> 01:43:59,189
particles and the basic
gravitational interaction uh

5438
01:43:59,189 --> 01:43:59,199
gravitational interaction uh
 

5439
01:43:59,199 --> 01:44:03,270
gravitational interaction uh
if you ran them backwards in time

5440
01:44:03,270 --> 01:44:03,280
if you ran them backwards in time
 

5441
01:44:03,280 --> 01:44:06,310
if you ran them backwards in time
you'd get the same laws so if

5442
01:44:06,310 --> 01:44:06,320
you'd get the same laws so if
 

5443
01:44:06,320 --> 01:44:09,510
you'd get the same laws so if
ag again going unless this time we don't

5444
01:44:09,510 --> 01:44:09,520
ag again going unless this time we don't
 

5445
01:44:09,520 --> 01:44:10,709
ag again going unless this time we don't
talk about a

5446
01:44:10,709 --> 01:44:10,719
talk about a
 

5447
01:44:10,719 --> 01:44:13,189
talk about a
a mirror but we talk about a movie if

5448
01:44:13,189 --> 01:44:13,199
a mirror but we talk about a movie if
 

5449
01:44:13,199 --> 01:44:14,629
a mirror but we talk about a movie if
you take a movie

5450
01:44:14,629 --> 01:44:14,639
you take a movie
 

5451
01:44:14,639 --> 01:44:18,629
you take a movie
and then run it backwards

5452
01:44:18,629 --> 01:44:18,639
and then run it backwards
 

5453
01:44:18,639 --> 01:44:21,590
and then run it backwards
that's the time reversal uh it's good to

5454
01:44:21,590 --> 01:44:21,600
that's the time reversal uh it's good to
 

5455
01:44:21,600 --> 01:44:22,550
that's the time reversal uh it's good to
think about a mirror

5456
01:44:22,550 --> 01:44:22,560
think about a mirror
 

5457
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:25,109
think about a mirror
in time yeah it's like a mirror in time

5458
01:44:25,109 --> 01:44:25,119
in time yeah it's like a mirror in time
 

5459
01:44:25,119 --> 01:44:25,669
in time yeah it's like a mirror in time
if you

5460
01:44:25,669 --> 01:44:25,679
if you
 

5461
01:44:25,679 --> 01:44:28,950
if you
uh if you run run the movie backwards

5462
01:44:28,950 --> 01:44:28,960
uh if you run run the movie backwards
 

5463
01:44:28,960 --> 01:44:30,870
uh if you run run the movie backwards
it would look very strange if you were

5464
01:44:30,870 --> 01:44:30,880
it would look very strange if you were
 

5465
01:44:30,880 --> 01:44:33,510
it would look very strange if you were
looking at complicated objects and

5466
01:44:33,510 --> 01:44:33,520
looking at complicated objects and
 

5467
01:44:33,520 --> 01:44:35,990
looking at complicated objects and
uh you know a charlie chaplin movie or

5468
01:44:35,990 --> 01:44:36,000
uh you know a charlie chaplin movie or
 

5469
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:36,950
uh you know a charlie chaplin movie or
whatever

5470
01:44:36,950 --> 01:44:36,960
whatever
 

5471
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:38,390
whatever
they it would look very strange if you

5472
01:44:38,390 --> 01:44:38,400
they it would look very strange if you
 

5473
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:40,229
they it would look very strange if you
ran it backwards in time

5474
01:44:40,229 --> 01:44:40,239
ran it backwards in time
 

5475
01:44:40,239 --> 01:44:43,590
ran it backwards in time
but at the level of basic interactions

5476
01:44:43,590 --> 01:44:43,600
but at the level of basic interactions
 

5477
01:44:43,600 --> 01:44:44,310
but at the level of basic interactions
if you

5478
01:44:44,310 --> 01:44:44,320
if you
 

5479
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:46,550
if you
were able to look at the atoms and the

5480
01:44:46,550 --> 01:44:46,560
were able to look at the atoms and the
 

5481
01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:48,390
were able to look at the atoms and the
and the quarks involved

5482
01:44:48,390 --> 01:44:48,400
and the quarks involved
 

5483
01:44:48,400 --> 01:44:50,629
and the quarks involved
they would obey the same laws they do a

5484
01:44:50,629 --> 01:44:50,639
they would obey the same laws they do a
 

5485
01:44:50,639 --> 01:44:53,189
they would obey the same laws they do a
very good approximation but not exactly

5486
01:44:53,189 --> 01:44:53,199
very good approximation but not exactly
 

5487
01:44:53,199 --> 01:44:54,870
very good approximation but not exactly
so you this is not exactly that means

5488
01:44:54,870 --> 01:44:54,880
so you this is not exactly that means
 

5489
01:44:54,880 --> 01:44:56,790
so you this is not exactly that means
you could tell you could tell

5490
01:44:56,790 --> 01:44:56,800
you could tell you could tell
 

5491
01:44:56,800 --> 01:45:00,709
you could tell you could tell
but you'd have to do very very subtle

5492
01:45:00,709 --> 01:45:00,719
but you'd have to do very very subtle
 

5493
01:45:00,719 --> 01:45:03,030
but you'd have to do very very subtle
experiments with at high energy

5494
01:45:03,030 --> 01:45:03,040
experiments with at high energy

this was a discovery by uh
 

5503
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:15,270
this was a discovery by uh

physics with all this precise laws
 

5515
01:45:25,119 --> 01:45:28,830
physics with all this precise laws
they did seem to have this gratuitous

01:45:28,830 --> 01:45:28,840
they did seem to have this gratuitous
 

5517
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:29,990
they did seem to have this gratuitous

01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:31,910
property
that they look the same if you run the

equations backwards
 

5523
01:45:33,199 --> 01:45:34,870

it's kind of an embarrassing property

5524
01:45:34,870 --> 01:45:34,880
it's kind of an embarrassing property
 

5525
01:45:34,880 --> 01:45:36,950
it's kind of an embarrassing property
actually because

5526
01:45:36,950 --> 01:45:36,960
actually because
 

5527
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:39,270
actually because
life isn't like that so empirical

5528
01:45:39,270 --> 01:45:39,280
life isn't like that so empirical
 

5529
01:45:39,280 --> 01:45:41,750
life isn't like that so empirical
reality does not have this imagery

reality does not have this imagery
 

5531
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:44,709
reality does not have this imagery
in any obvious way and yet the laws did

in any obvious way and yet the laws did
 

5533
01:45:44,719 --> 01:45:46,229

it's almost like the laws of physics are

it's almost like the laws of physics are
 

5535
01:45:46,239 --> 01:45:48,629
it's almost like the laws of physics are
missing something fundamental about life

that's interesting and uh actually it's

01:46:36,639 --> 01:46:38,629
that's interesting and uh actually it's
an exciting frontier of physics now to

uh
 

5593
01:46:47,440 --> 01:46:48,950
uh
i definitely have to ask if i'll time

5594
01:46:48,950 --> 01:46:48,960
i definitely have to ask if i'll time
 

5595
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:50,629
i definitely have to ask if i'll time
crystals in a second here but

5596
01:46:50,629 --> 01:46:50,639
crystals in a second here but
 

5597
01:46:50,639 --> 01:46:54,310
crystals in a second here but
so the cp problem and t so there's

5598
01:46:54,310 --> 01:46:54,320
so the cp problem and t so there's
 

5599
01:46:54,320 --> 01:46:56,470
so the cp problem and t so there's
lost all of these we're in danger of

5600
01:46:56,470 --> 01:46:56,480
lost all of these we're in danger of
 

5601
01:46:56,480 --> 01:46:58,149
lost all of these we're in danger of
infinite regress but we'll

5602
01:46:58,149 --> 01:46:58,159
infinite regress but we'll
 

5603
01:46:58,159 --> 01:47:00,870
infinite regress but we'll
convert soon so can't possibly be

5604
01:47:00,870 --> 01:47:00,880
convert soon so can't possibly be
 

5605
01:47:00,880 --> 01:47:01,910
convert soon so can't possibly be
turtles all the way down

5606
01:47:01,910 --> 01:47:01,920
turtles all the way down
 

5607
01:47:01,920 --> 01:47:03,350
turtles all the way down
we're going to get to the bottom turtle

5608
01:47:03,350 --> 01:47:03,360
we're going to get to the bottom turtle
 

5609
01:47:03,360 --> 01:47:06,229
we're going to get to the bottom turtle
so so so it became

5610
01:47:06,229 --> 01:47:06,239
so so so it became
 

5611
01:47:06,239 --> 01:47:09,270
so so so it became
so it it got to be a real i mean it's a

5612
01:47:09,270 --> 01:47:09,280
so it it got to be a real i mean it's a
 

5613
01:47:09,280 --> 01:47:11,030
so it it got to be a real i mean it's a
really puzzling thing

5614
01:47:11,030 --> 01:47:11,040
really puzzling thing
 

5615
01:47:11,040 --> 01:47:14,229
really puzzling thing
uh why the laws should have this very

5616
01:47:14,229 --> 01:47:14,239
uh why the laws should have this very
 

5617
01:47:14,239 --> 01:47:16,629
uh why the laws should have this very
odd property that we don't need

5618
01:47:16,629 --> 01:47:16,639
odd property that we don't need
 

5619
01:47:16,639 --> 01:47:18,390
odd property that we don't need
and in fact it's kind of an

5620
01:47:18,390 --> 01:47:18,400
and in fact it's kind of an
 

5621
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:19,830
and in fact it's kind of an
embarrassment

5622
01:47:19,830 --> 01:47:19,840
embarrassment
 

5623
01:47:19,840 --> 01:47:22,950
embarrassment
in addressing empirical reality but it

5624
01:47:22,950 --> 01:47:22,960
in addressing empirical reality but it
 

5625
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:23,990
in addressing empirical reality but it
seemed to be

5626
01:47:23,990 --> 01:47:24,000
seemed to be
 

5627
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:25,830
seemed to be
almost it seemed to be exactly true for

5628
01:47:25,830 --> 01:47:25,840
almost it seemed to be exactly true for
 

5629
01:47:25,840 --> 01:47:27,910
almost it seemed to be exactly true for
a long time and then

5630
01:47:27,910 --> 01:47:27,920
a long time and then
 

5631
01:47:27,920 --> 01:47:30,950
a long time and then
uh almost true and

5632
01:47:30,950 --> 01:47:30,960
uh almost true and
 

5633
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:33,910
uh almost true and
and in way almost true was even is more

5634
01:47:33,910 --> 01:47:33,920
and in way almost true was even is more
 

5635
01:47:33,920 --> 01:47:36,470
and in way almost true was even is more
disturbing than exactly true because

5636
01:47:36,470 --> 01:47:36,480
disturbing than exactly true because
 

5637
01:47:36,480 --> 01:47:38,229
disturbing than exactly true because
exactly true it could have been just a

5638
01:47:38,229 --> 01:47:38,239
exactly true it could have been just a
 

5639
01:47:38,239 --> 01:47:39,910
exactly true it could have been just a
fundamental feature of the world and you

5640
01:47:39,910 --> 01:47:39,920
fundamental feature of the world and you
 

5641
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:41,510
fundamental feature of the world and you
know at some level you just have to take

5642
01:47:41,510 --> 01:47:41,520
know at some level you just have to take
 

5643
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:42,950
know at some level you just have to take
it as it is and if it's

5644
01:47:42,950 --> 01:47:42,960
it as it is and if it's
 

5645
01:47:42,960 --> 01:47:46,629
it as it is and if it's
if it's a beautiful easily articulatable

5646
01:47:46,629 --> 01:47:46,639
if it's a beautiful easily articulatable
 

5647
01:47:46,639 --> 01:47:48,550
if it's a beautiful easily articulatable
regularity you could say that okay

5648
01:47:48,550 --> 01:47:48,560
regularity you could say that okay
 

5649
01:47:48,560 --> 01:47:49,669
regularity you could say that okay
that's a that's

5650
01:47:49,669 --> 01:47:49,679
that's a that's
 

5651
01:47:49,679 --> 01:47:51,669
that's a that's
fine as a fundamental law of nature but

5652
01:47:51,669 --> 01:47:51,679
fine as a fundamental law of nature but
 

5653
01:47:51,679 --> 01:47:53,430
fine as a fundamental law of nature but
to say that it's approximately true but

5654
01:47:53,430 --> 01:47:53,440
to say that it's approximately true but
 

5655
01:47:53,440 --> 01:47:55,350
to say that it's approximately true but
not exactly that's that's that's right

5656
01:47:55,350 --> 01:47:55,360
not exactly that's that's that's right
 

5657
01:47:55,360 --> 01:47:58,629
not exactly that's that's that's right
that's weird so uh and then

5658
01:47:58,629 --> 01:47:58,639
that's weird so uh and then
 

5659
01:47:58,639 --> 01:48:01,750
that's weird so uh and then
so there was great progress in

5660
01:48:01,750 --> 01:48:01,760
so there was great progress in
 

5661
01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:05,669
so there was great progress in
uh the late part of the 20th century

5662
01:48:05,669 --> 01:48:05,679
uh the late part of the 20th century
 

5663
01:48:05,679 --> 01:48:09,350
uh the late part of the 20th century
uh in getting to an understanding of

5664
01:48:09,350 --> 01:48:09,360
uh in getting to an understanding of
 

5665
01:48:09,360 --> 01:48:11,510
uh in getting to an understanding of
fundamental interactions in general

5666
01:48:11,510 --> 01:48:11,520
fundamental interactions in general
 

5667
01:48:11,520 --> 01:48:14,709
fundamental interactions in general
that shed light on this issue uh

5668
01:48:14,709 --> 01:48:14,719
that shed light on this issue uh
 

5669
01:48:14,719 --> 01:48:17,990
that shed light on this issue uh
it turns out that the prince

5670
01:48:17,990 --> 01:48:18,000
it turns out that the prince
 

5671
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,950
it turns out that the prince
basic principles of relativity and

5672
01:48:20,950 --> 01:48:20,960
basic principles of relativity and
 

5673
01:48:20,960 --> 01:48:23,350
basic principles of relativity and
quantum mechanics plus

5674
01:48:23,350 --> 01:48:23,360
quantum mechanics plus
 

5675
01:48:23,360 --> 01:48:26,550
quantum mechanics plus
the kind of high degree of symmetry that

5676
01:48:26,550 --> 01:48:26,560
the kind of high degree of symmetry that
 

5677
01:48:26,560 --> 01:48:26,870
the kind of high degree of symmetry that
we

5678
01:48:26,870 --> 01:48:26,880
we
 

5679
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:29,590
we
found the so-called gage symmetry that

5680
01:48:29,590 --> 01:48:29,600
found the so-called gage symmetry that
 

5681
01:48:29,600 --> 01:48:31,189
found the so-called gage symmetry that
characterizes the fundamental

5682
01:48:31,189 --> 01:48:31,199
characterizes the fundamental
 

5683
01:48:31,199 --> 01:48:32,550
characterizes the fundamental
interactions when you put all that

5684
01:48:32,550 --> 01:48:32,560
interactions when you put all that
 

5685
01:48:32,560 --> 01:48:33,669
interactions when you put all that
together

5686
01:48:33,669 --> 01:48:33,679
together
 

5687
01:48:33,679 --> 01:48:37,430
together
it's a very very constraining framework

5688
01:48:37,430 --> 01:48:37,440
it's a very very constraining framework
 

5689
01:48:37,440 --> 01:48:42,390
it's a very very constraining framework
and it has some indirect consequences

5690
01:48:42,390 --> 01:48:42,400

 

5691
01:48:42,400 --> 01:48:44,830

because the possible interactions are so

5692
01:48:44,830 --> 01:48:44,840
because the possible interactions are so
 

5693
01:48:44,840 --> 01:48:47,109
because the possible interactions are so
constrained and one of the indirect

5694
01:48:47,109 --> 01:48:47,119
constrained and one of the indirect
 

5695
01:48:47,119 --> 01:48:48,550
constrained and one of the indirect
consequences

5696
01:48:48,550 --> 01:48:48,560
consequences
 

5697
01:48:48,560 --> 01:48:52,229
consequences
is that the possibilities for

5698
01:48:52,229 --> 01:48:52,239
is that the possibilities for
 

5699
01:48:52,239 --> 01:48:55,270
is that the possibilities for
violating the symmetry between forwards

5700
01:48:55,270 --> 01:48:55,280
violating the symmetry between forwards
 

5701
01:48:55,280 --> 01:48:57,750
violating the symmetry between forwards
and backwards in time are very limited

5702
01:48:57,750 --> 01:48:57,760
and backwards in time are very limited
 

5703
01:48:57,760 --> 01:49:00,870
and backwards in time are very limited
there are basically only two

5704
01:49:00,870 --> 01:49:00,880
there are basically only two
 

5705
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:03,990
there are basically only two
and one of them occurs and leads to a

5706
01:49:03,990 --> 01:49:04,000
and one of them occurs and leads to a
 

5707
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:05,830
and one of them occurs and leads to a
very rich theory that explains the

5708
01:49:05,830 --> 01:49:05,840
very rich theory that explains the
 

5709
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:07,990
very rich theory that explains the
cronin fish experiment and a lot of

5710
01:49:07,990 --> 01:49:08,000
cronin fish experiment and a lot of
 

5711
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:09,510
cronin fish experiment and a lot of
things that have been done subsequently

5712
01:49:09,510 --> 01:49:09,520
things that have been done subsequently
 

5713
01:49:09,520 --> 01:49:10,709
things that have been done subsequently
has been used to

5714
01:49:10,709 --> 01:49:10,719
has been used to
 

5715
01:49:10,719 --> 01:49:13,510
has been used to
make all kinds of successful predictions

5716
01:49:13,510 --> 01:49:13,520
make all kinds of successful predictions
 

5717
01:49:13,520 --> 01:49:13,990
make all kinds of successful predictions
so that's

5718
01:49:13,990 --> 01:49:14,000
so that's
 

5719
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:17,510
so that's
that's turned out to be a very rich

5720
01:49:17,510 --> 01:49:17,520

 

5721
01:49:17,520 --> 01:49:20,790

interaction it's esoteric and the

5722
01:49:20,790 --> 01:49:20,800
interaction it's esoteric and the
 

5723
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:21,510
interaction it's esoteric and the
effects are

5724
01:49:21,510 --> 01:49:21,520
effects are
 

5725
01:49:21,520 --> 01:49:23,189
effects are
only show up at accelerators and are

5726
01:49:23,189 --> 01:49:23,199
only show up at accelerators and are
 

5727
01:49:23,199 --> 01:49:24,790
only show up at accelerators and are
small and so on but they might have been

5728
01:49:24,790 --> 01:49:24,800
small and so on but they might have been
 

5729
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:26,950
small and so on but they might have been
very important in the early universe and

5730
01:49:26,950 --> 01:49:26,960
very important in the early universe and
 

5731
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:28,950
very important in the early universe and
lead to them be connected to the

5732
01:49:28,950 --> 01:49:28,960
lead to them be connected to the
 

5733
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:31,270
lead to them be connected to the
asymmetry between matter and anti-matter

5734
01:49:31,270 --> 01:49:31,280
asymmetry between matter and anti-matter
 

5735
01:49:31,280 --> 01:49:33,350
asymmetry between matter and anti-matter
in the present universe and so but

5736
01:49:33,350 --> 01:49:33,360
in the present universe and so but
 

5737
01:49:33,360 --> 01:49:36,149
in the present universe and so but
that's a that's another digression

5738
01:49:36,149 --> 01:49:36,159
that's a that's another digression
 

5739
01:49:36,159 --> 01:49:39,830
that's a that's another digression
the the point is that uh that was fine

5740
01:49:39,830 --> 01:49:39,840
the the point is that uh that was fine
 

5741
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:40,950
the the point is that uh that was fine
that was a triumph

5742
01:49:40,950 --> 01:49:40,960
that was a triumph
 

5743
01:49:40,960 --> 01:49:43,830
that was a triumph
to say that there was one possible kind

5744
01:49:43,830 --> 01:49:43,840
to say that there was one possible kind
 

5745
01:49:43,840 --> 01:49:46,149
to say that there was one possible kind
of interaction that would violate

5746
01:49:46,149 --> 01:49:46,159
of interaction that would violate
 

5747
01:49:46,159 --> 01:49:47,750
of interaction that would violate
time reversal symmetry and sure enough

5748
01:49:47,750 --> 01:49:47,760
time reversal symmetry and sure enough
 

5749
01:49:47,760 --> 01:49:49,270
time reversal symmetry and sure enough
there it is and

5750
01:49:49,270 --> 01:49:49,280
there it is and
 

5751
01:49:49,280 --> 01:49:52,709
there it is and
but the other kind

5752
01:49:52,709 --> 01:49:52,719

01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:59,350
why
doesn't it occur uh so but

01:49:59,350 --> 01:49:59,360
doesn't it occur uh so but
 

5759
01:49:59,360 --> 01:50:01,270
doesn't it occur uh so but
we're so we're close to really finally

today
and we have a promising proposal for how

5778
01:50:25,750 --> 01:50:25,760
and we have a promising proposal for how
 

5779
01:50:25,760 --> 01:50:27,350
and we have a promising proposal for how
it works

5780
01:50:27,350 --> 01:50:27,360
it works
 

5781
01:50:27,360 --> 01:50:31,189
it works

which is a kind of theory of evolution
 

5783
01:50:31,199 --> 01:50:34,310
which is a kind of theory of evolution
so there's this possible

5784
01:50:34,310 --> 01:50:34,320
so there's this possible
 

5785
01:50:34,320 --> 01:50:37,350
so there's this possible

there's a numerical quantity
that tells us how strong that is and

that tells us how strong that is and

but in this case
 

5813
01:51:10,239 --> 01:51:13,350
but in this case
it's been fruitful to think

it's been fruitful to think
 

5815
01:51:13,360 --> 01:51:16,470
it's been fruitful to think
and work out a theory where

01:51:16,470 --> 01:51:16,480
and work out a theory where

fields are the fundamental ingredients

5826
01:51:31,350 --> 01:51:31,360
fields are the fundamental ingredients
 

5827
01:51:31,360 --> 01:51:32,629
fields are the fundamental ingredients
of modern physics like

5828
01:51:32,629 --> 01:51:32,639
of modern physics like
 

5829
01:51:32,639 --> 01:51:34,149
of modern physics like
there's an electron field there's a

5830
01:51:34,149 --> 01:51:34,159
there's an electron field there's a
 

5831
01:51:34,159 --> 01:51:35,910
there's an electron field there's a
photon field which is also called the

5832
01:51:35,910 --> 01:51:35,920
photon field which is also called the
 

5833
01:51:35,920 --> 01:51:37,510
photon field which is also called the
electromagnetic field and so

5834
01:51:37,510 --> 01:51:37,520
electromagnetic field and so
 

5835
01:51:37,520 --> 01:51:39,189
electromagnetic field and so
every all of these particles are

5836
01:51:39,189 --> 01:51:39,199
every all of these particles are
 

5837
01:51:39,199 --> 01:51:41,589
every all of these particles are
manifestations of different fields

5838
01:51:41,589 --> 01:51:41,599
manifestations of different fields
 

5839
01:51:41,599 --> 01:51:45,189
manifestations of different fields
and uh there could be a field

5840
01:51:45,189 --> 01:51:45,199
and uh there could be a field
 

5841
01:51:45,199 --> 01:51:47,510
and uh there could be a field
something that depends on space and time

5842
01:51:47,510 --> 01:51:47,520
something that depends on space and time
 

5843
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:49,910
something that depends on space and time
so a dynamical entity

5844
01:51:49,910 --> 01:51:49,920
so a dynamical entity
 

5845
01:51:49,920 --> 01:51:53,030
so a dynamical entity
instead of just a constant here

5846

instead of just a constant here

instead of just a constant here
and if you do things in a nice

5848
01:51:56,709 --> 01:51:56,719
and if you do things in a nice
 

5849
01:51:56,719 --> 01:51:59,189
and if you do things in a nice
way that's very symmetric very much

aesthetically by the theory uh but but

then you find that you get

then you find that you get
 

5859
01:52:09,119 --> 01:52:12,550
then you find that you get
a field which

5860

a field which

01:53:22,629 --> 01:53:22,639
calculate how much
 

5917
01:53:22,639 --> 01:53:26,550
calculate how much
energy is in these residual oscillations

5918
01:53:26,550 --> 01:53:26,560
energy is in these residual oscillations
 

5919
01:53:26,560 --> 01:53:29,589
energy is in these residual oscillations
these this axion gas that fills all the

5920
01:53:29,589 --> 01:53:29,599
these this axion gas that fills all the
 

5921
01:53:29,599 --> 01:53:31,350
these this axion gas that fills all the
universe if this fundamental theory is

5922
01:53:31,350 --> 01:53:31,360
universe if this fundamental theory is
 

5923
01:53:31,360 --> 01:53:32,149
universe if this fundamental theory is
correct

5924
01:53:32,149 --> 01:53:32,159
correct
 

5925
01:53:32,159 --> 01:53:36,310
correct
you get just the right amount

5926
01:53:36,310 --> 01:53:36,320
you get just the right amount
 

5927
01:53:36,320 --> 01:53:38,390
you get just the right amount
to make the dark matter that astronomers

5928
01:53:38,390 --> 01:53:38,400
to make the dark matter that astronomers
 

5929
01:53:38,400 --> 01:53:40,149
to make the dark matter that astronomers
want and it has

5930
01:53:40,149 --> 01:53:40,159
want and it has
 

5931
01:53:40,159 --> 01:53:42,550
want and it has
just the right properties so i'd love to

5932
01:53:42,550 --> 01:53:42,560
just the right properties so i'd love to
 

5933
01:53:42,560 --> 01:53:44,149
just the right properties so i'd love to
believe that

5934
01:53:44,149 --> 01:53:44,159
believe that
 

5935
01:53:44,159 --> 01:53:47,510
believe that
so that might be a thing that unlocks uh

5936
01:53:47,510 --> 01:53:47,520
so that might be a thing that unlocks uh
 

5937
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:49,510
so that might be a thing that unlocks uh
might be the key to understanding dark

5938
01:53:49,510 --> 01:53:49,520
might be the key to understanding dark
 

5939
01:53:49,520 --> 01:53:51,350
might be the key to understanding dark
matter yeah i'd like to think so

5940
01:53:51,350 --> 01:53:51,360
matter yeah i'd like to think so
 

5941
01:53:51,360 --> 01:53:52,950
matter yeah i'd like to think so
and many many physicists are coming

5942
01:53:52,950 --> 01:53:52,960
and many many physicists are coming
 

5943
01:53:52,960 --> 01:53:56,229
and many many physicists are coming
around to this point of view which

5944
01:53:56,229 --> 01:53:56,239
around to this point of view which
 

5945
01:53:56,239 --> 01:53:58,310
around to this point of view which
i've been a voice in the wilderness i

5946
01:53:58,310 --> 01:53:58,320
i've been a voice in the wilderness i
 

5947
01:53:58,320 --> 01:53:59,750
i've been a voice in the wilderness i
was a voice in the wilderness

5948
01:53:59,750 --> 01:53:59,760
was a voice in the wilderness
 

5949
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:02,229
was a voice in the wilderness
for a long time but now now it's become

5950
01:54:02,229 --> 01:54:02,239
for a long time but now now it's become
 

5951
01:54:02,239 --> 01:54:04,470
for a long time but now now it's become
very popular maybe even dominant

5952
01:54:04,470 --> 01:54:04,480
very popular maybe even dominant
 

5953
01:54:04,480 --> 01:54:07,669
very popular maybe even dominant
so almost like so this axion

5954
01:54:07,669 --> 01:54:07,679
so almost like so this axion
 

5955
01:54:07,679 --> 01:54:11,589
so almost like so this axion
particle slash field would be the thing

5956
01:54:11,589 --> 01:54:11,599

01:54:11,599 --> 01:54:12,870
particle slash field would be the thing

01:54:12,870 --> 01:54:12,880
that explains
 

5959
01:54:12,880 --> 01:54:14,790
that explains
dark matter it explained yeah would

01:54:14,790 --> 01:54:14,800
dark matter it explained yeah would
 

5961
01:54:14,800 --> 01:54:16,709
dark matter it explained yeah would
solve this fundamental question

5962
01:54:16,709 --> 01:54:16,719
solve this fundamental question
 

5963
01:54:16,719 --> 01:54:20,470
solve this fundamental question

that's not what it was

already but
 

6033
01:55:35,520 --> 01:55:38,310
already but
but i think there's good hope that we

6034
01:55:38,310 --> 01:55:38,320
but i think there's good hope that we
 

6035
01:55:38,320 --> 01:55:40,790
but i think there's good hope that we
can get down to the required sensitivity

6036
01:55:40,790 --> 01:55:40,800
can get down to the required sensitivity
 

6037
01:55:40,800 --> 01:55:42,470
can get down to the required sensitivity

6079
01:56:24,880 --> 01:56:29,350
crystals are orderly arrangements of
uh atoms in space and

6080
01:56:29,350 --> 01:56:29,360
uh atoms in space and
 

6081
01:56:29,360 --> 01:56:33,189
uh atoms in space and
many materials if you cool them down

6082
01:56:33,189 --> 01:56:33,199
many materials if you cool them down
 

6083
01:56:33,199 --> 01:56:36,870
many materials if you cool them down
gently

6084
01:56:36,870 --> 01:56:36,880

 

6085
01:56:36,880 --> 01:56:40,390

will form crystals and so we say

6086
01:56:40,390 --> 01:56:40,400
will form crystals and so we say
 

6087
01:56:40,400 --> 01:56:43,750
will form crystals and so we say
that that's uh a spun a state of matter

6088
01:56:43,750 --> 01:56:43,760
that that's uh a spun a state of matter
 

6089
01:56:43,760 --> 01:56:46,790
that that's uh a spun a state of matter
that forms spontaneously and

6090
01:56:46,790 --> 01:56:46,800
that forms spontaneously and
 

6091
01:56:46,800 --> 01:56:49,270
that forms spontaneously and
uh an important feature of that state of

6092
01:56:49,270 --> 01:56:49,280
uh an important feature of that state of
 

6093
01:56:49,280 --> 01:56:50,149
uh an important feature of that state of
matter

6094
01:56:50,149 --> 01:56:50,159
matter
 

6095
01:56:50,159 --> 01:56:54,830
matter
is that the end result the crystal

6096
01:56:54,830 --> 01:56:54,840
is that the end result the crystal
 

6097
01:56:54,840 --> 01:56:58,229
is that the end result the crystal
uh has less

6098
01:56:58,229 --> 01:56:58,239
uh has less
 

6099
01:56:58,239 --> 01:57:01,589
uh has less
symmetry than the equations that give

6100
01:57:01,589 --> 01:57:01,599
symmetry than the equations that give
 

6101
01:57:01,599 --> 01:57:02,950
symmetry than the equations that give
rise to the crystal

6102
01:57:02,950 --> 01:57:02,960
rise to the crystal
 

6103
01:57:02,960 --> 01:57:06,709
rise to the crystal
so the equations the basic equations of

6104
01:57:06,709 --> 01:57:06,719
so the equations the basic equations of
 

6105
01:57:06,719 --> 01:57:09,189
so the equations the basic equations of
physics

6106
01:57:09,189 --> 01:57:09,199
physics
 

6107
01:57:09,199 --> 01:57:12,629
physics
are the same if you uh move a little bit

6108
01:57:12,629 --> 01:57:12,639
are the same if you uh move a little bit
 

6109
01:57:12,639 --> 01:57:15,669
are the same if you uh move a little bit
so you can move they're homogeneous but

6110
01:57:15,669 --> 01:57:15,679
so you can move they're homogeneous but
 

6111
01:57:15,679 --> 01:57:17,510
so you can move they're homogeneous but
crystals aren't the atoms are in

6112
01:57:17,510 --> 01:57:17,520
crystals aren't the atoms are in
 

6113
01:57:17,520 --> 01:57:18,149
crystals aren't the atoms are in
particular

place so though they have less symmetry

6116
01:57:20,470 --> 01:57:20,480

01:57:22,390 --> 01:57:22,400
uh
 

6119
01:57:22,400 --> 01:57:23,910
uh
and time crystals are the same thing in

6120
01:57:23,910 --> 01:57:23,920
and time crystals are the same thing in
 

6121
01:57:23,920 --> 01:57:26,470
and time crystals are the same thing in
time basically

01:57:26,470 --> 01:57:26,480
time basically
 

6123
01:57:26,480 --> 01:57:28,310
time basically
you but of course it's not so it's not

but it's ordering uh orderly behavior

6128
01:57:34,390 --> 01:57:34,400
but it's ordering uh orderly behavior
 

6129
01:57:34,400 --> 01:57:38,070
but it's ordering uh orderly behavior
uh that certain states of matter uh

6130
01:57:38,070 --> 01:57:38,080
uh that certain states of matter uh
 

6131
01:57:38,080 --> 01:57:39,750
uh that certain states of matter uh
will arrange themselves into

6132
01:57:39,750 --> 01:57:39,760
will arrange themselves into
 

6133
01:57:39,760 --> 01:57:42,390
will arrange themselves into
spontaneously if you do them

6135
01:57:42,400 --> 01:57:44,950

if you if you treat them gently and let

them do what they want to do
 

6139
01:57:46,639 --> 01:57:48,790
them do what they want to do
but indeed repeat in that same way

6140
01:57:48,790 --> 01:57:48,800
but indeed repeat in that same way
 

6141
01:57:48,800 --> 01:57:49,910
but indeed repeat in that same way
indefinitely

6142
01:57:49,910 --> 01:57:49,920
indefinitely
 

6143
01:57:49,920 --> 01:57:51,910
indefinitely
that's the crystalline form you can also

6144
01:57:51,910 --> 01:57:51,920
that's the crystalline form you can also
 

6145
01:57:51,920 --> 01:57:53,990
that's the crystalline form you can also
have uh

6146
01:57:53,990 --> 01:57:54,000
have uh
 

6147
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:55,830
have uh
time liquids or you can have all kinds

6148
01:57:55,830 --> 01:57:55,840
time liquids or you can have all kinds
 

6149
01:57:55,840 --> 01:57:57,669
time liquids or you can have all kinds
of other states of matter you don't have

6150
01:57:57,669 --> 01:57:57,679
of other states of matter you don't have
 

6151
01:57:57,679 --> 01:57:59,750
of other states of matter you don't have
space-time crystals where

6152
01:57:59,750 --> 01:57:59,760
space-time crystals where
 

6153
01:57:59,760 --> 01:58:02,870
space-time crystals where
the pattern only repeats if uh with each

6154
01:58:02,870 --> 01:58:02,880
the pattern only repeats if uh with each
 

6155
01:58:02,880 --> 01:58:05,189
the pattern only repeats if uh with each
step of time you also move at a certain

6156
01:58:05,189 --> 01:58:05,199
step of time you also move at a certain
 

6157
01:58:05,199 --> 01:58:07,990
step of time you also move at a certain
a certain direction in space so so yeah

6158
01:58:07,990 --> 01:58:08,000
a certain direction in space so so yeah
 

6159
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:08,870
a certain direction in space so so yeah
so but it's so

6160
01:58:08,870 --> 01:58:08,880
so but it's so
 

6161
01:58:08,880 --> 01:58:12,709
so but it's so
it's basically it's states of matter

6162
01:58:12,709 --> 01:58:12,719
it's basically it's states of matter
 

6163
01:58:12,719 --> 01:58:16,070
it's basically it's states of matter
that uh oh base

6164
01:58:16,070 --> 01:58:16,080
that uh oh base
 

6165
01:58:16,080 --> 01:58:17,910
that uh oh base
that display structure in time

6166
01:58:17,910 --> 01:58:17,920
that display structure in time
 

6167
01:58:17,920 --> 01:58:19,189
that display structure in time
spontaneously

6168
01:58:19,189 --> 01:58:19,199
spontaneously
 

6169
01:58:19,199 --> 01:58:21,350
spontaneously
so here's here's the difference when it

6170
01:58:21,350 --> 01:58:21,360
so here's here's the difference when it
 

6171
01:58:21,360 --> 01:58:23,430
so here's here's the difference when it
happens in time

6172
01:58:23,430 --> 01:58:23,440
happens in time
 

6173
01:58:23,440 --> 01:58:26,629
happens in time
uh it sure looks a lot like

6174
01:58:26,629 --> 01:58:26,639
uh it sure looks a lot like
 

6175
01:58:26,639 --> 01:58:28,550
uh it sure looks a lot like
it's motion and if it repeats

6176
01:58:28,550 --> 01:58:28,560
it's motion and if it repeats
 

6177
01:58:28,560 --> 01:58:30,629
it's motion and if it repeats
indefinitely it sure looks a lot like

6178
01:58:30,629 --> 01:58:30,639
indefinitely it sure looks a lot like
 

6179
01:58:30,639 --> 01:58:31,830
indefinitely it sure looks a lot like
perpetual motion

6180
01:58:31,830 --> 01:58:31,840
perpetual motion
 

6181
01:58:31,840 --> 01:58:36,070
perpetual motion
yeah like uh looks like free lunch

6182
01:58:36,070 --> 01:58:36,080
yeah like uh looks like free lunch
 

6183
01:58:36,080 --> 01:58:38,070
yeah like uh looks like free lunch
i was told that there's no such thing as

01:58:38,070 --> 01:58:38,080
i was told that there's no such thing as
 

6185
01:58:38,080 --> 01:58:39,109
i was told that there's no such thing as
free lunch does

01:58:39,109 --> 01:58:39,119
free lunch does
 

6187
01:58:39,119 --> 01:58:41,910
free lunch does
does this violate laws of thermodynamics

6188
01:58:41,910 --> 01:58:41,920
does this violate laws of thermodynamics
 

6189
01:58:41,920 --> 01:58:42,390
does this violate laws of thermodynamics
uh

6190
01:58:42,390 --> 01:58:42,400
uh
 

6191
01:58:42,400 --> 01:58:44,550
uh
no but it requires a critical

right they're not we don't posit them

universally and we found finding some of
 

6221
01:59:14,080 --> 01:59:15,589

the subtleties and

6222
01:59:15,589 --> 01:59:15,599
the subtleties and
 

6223
01:59:15,599 --> 01:59:18,550
the subtleties and
sort of accept edge cases uh where they

6224
01:59:18,550 --> 01:59:18,560
sort of accept edge cases uh where they
 

6225
01:59:18,560 --> 01:59:19,189
sort of accept edge cases uh where they
don't

don't

01:59:22,400 --> 01:59:25,510
apply in a straightforward way
and this is one uh so

6230
01:59:25,510 --> 01:59:25,520
and this is one uh so
 

6231
01:59:25,520 --> 01:59:28,629
and this is one uh so
time crystals do obey do have this

6232
01:59:28,629 --> 01:59:28,639
time crystals do obey do have this
 

6233
01:59:28,639 --> 01:59:31,109
time crystals do obey do have this
structure in time but it's not a free

what they want to do
 

6243
01:59:38,960 --> 01:59:42,149
what they want to do
they're in there so if if you want to

6244
01:59:42,149 --> 01:59:42,159
they're in there so if if you want to
 

6245
01:59:42,159 --> 01:59:42,709
they're in there so if if you want to
extract

6246
01:59:42,709 --> 01:59:42,719
extract
 

6247
01:59:42,719 --> 01:59:44,790
extract
energy from it you're going to be foiled

6248
01:59:44,790 --> 01:59:44,800
energy from it you're going to be foiled
 

6249
01:59:44,800 --> 01:59:45,830
energy from it you're going to be foiled
because there's no

6250
01:59:45,830 --> 01:59:45,840
because there's no
 

6251
01:59:45,840 --> 01:59:49,510
because there's no
spare energy there you uh

6252
01:59:49,510 --> 01:59:49,520
spare energy there you uh
 

6253
01:59:49,520 --> 01:59:52,390
spare energy there you uh
it's or so you you can add energy to it

6254
01:59:52,390 --> 01:59:52,400
it's or so you you can add energy to it
 

6255
01:59:52,400 --> 01:59:53,750
it's or so you you can add energy to it
and kind of disturb it

6256
01:59:53,750 --> 01:59:53,760
and kind of disturb it
 

6257
01:59:53,760 --> 01:59:56,790
and kind of disturb it
but but you can't extract energy

6258
01:59:56,790 --> 01:59:56,800
but but you can't extract energy
 

6259
01:59:56,800 --> 01:59:59,669
but but you can't extract energy
from this motion because it's gonna it

6260
01:59:59,669 --> 01:59:59,679
from this motion because it's gonna it
 

6261
01:59:59,679 --> 02:00:01,750
from this motion because it's gonna it
wants to do that's the lowest energy

6262
02:00:01,750 --> 02:00:01,760
wants to do that's the lowest energy
 

6263
02:00:01,760 --> 02:00:03,990
wants to do that's the lowest energy
configuration that there is so you can

6264
02:00:03,990 --> 02:00:04,000
configuration that there is so you can
 

6265
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:04,790
configuration that there is so you can
you can't get

6266
02:00:04,790 --> 02:00:04,800
you can't get
 

6267
02:00:04,800 --> 02:00:06,550
you can't get
further energy out of it so in theory i

6268
02:00:06,550 --> 02:00:06,560
further energy out of it so in theory i
 

6269
02:00:06,560 --> 02:00:09,750
further energy out of it so in theory i
guess perpetual motion

6270
02:00:09,750 --> 02:00:09,760
guess perpetual motion
 

6271
02:00:09,760 --> 02:00:11,990
guess perpetual motion
uh you would be able to extract energy

6272
02:00:11,990 --> 02:00:12,000
uh you would be able to extract energy
 

6273
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:12,950
uh you would be able to extract energy
from it yeah

6274
02:00:12,950 --> 02:00:12,960
from it yeah
 

6275
02:00:12,960 --> 02:00:15,030
from it yeah
if such a thing was to be created you

6276
02:00:15,030 --> 02:00:15,040
if such a thing was to be created you
 

6277
02:00:15,040 --> 02:00:17,589
if such a thing was to be created you
could then milk it for energy well

6278
02:00:17,589 --> 02:00:17,599
could then milk it for energy well
 

6279
02:00:17,599 --> 02:00:21,109
could then milk it for energy well
what's usually meant in the literature

6280
02:00:21,109 --> 02:00:21,119
what's usually meant in the literature
 

6281
02:00:21,119 --> 02:00:23,030
what's usually meant in the literature
of perpetual motion

6282
02:00:23,030 --> 02:00:23,040
of perpetual motion
 

6283
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:27,750
of perpetual motion
is a kind of macroscopic motion that you

6284
02:00:27,750 --> 02:00:27,760
is a kind of macroscopic motion that you
 

6285
02:00:27,760 --> 02:00:28,470
is a kind of macroscopic motion that you
could extract

6286
02:00:28,470 --> 02:00:28,480
could extract
 

6287
02:00:28,480 --> 02:00:31,750
could extract
energy from and and somehow it would

6288
02:00:31,750 --> 02:00:31,760
energy from and and somehow it would
 

6289
02:00:31,760 --> 02:00:34,390
energy from and and somehow it would
crank back up right that's that's not

6290
02:00:34,390 --> 02:00:34,400
crank back up right that's that's not
 

6291
02:00:34,400 --> 02:00:35,990
crank back up right that's that's not
the case here if you want to extract

6292
02:00:35,990 --> 02:00:36,000
the case here if you want to extract
 

6293
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:39,350
the case here if you want to extract
energy uh this motion is

6294
02:00:39,350 --> 02:00:39,360
energy uh this motion is
 

6295
02:00:39,360 --> 02:00:41,669
energy uh this motion is
is not something you can extract energy

6296
02:00:41,669 --> 02:00:41,679
is not something you can extract energy
 

6297
02:00:41,679 --> 02:00:43,030
is not something you can extract energy
from if you

from if you
 

6299
02:00:43,040 --> 02:00:46,149
from if you
intervene in the behavior you can

02:00:46,149 --> 02:00:46,159
intervene in the behavior you can
 

6301
02:00:46,159 --> 02:00:48,149
intervene in the behavior you can
uh change it but only by injecting

6302
02:00:48,149 --> 02:00:48,159
uh change it but only by injecting
 

6303
02:00:48,159 --> 02:00:50,950
uh change it but only by injecting
energy not not by taking away energy

6304
02:00:50,950 --> 02:00:50,960

ideas out there in your view
 

6341
02:01:29,360 --> 02:01:32,470
ideas out there in your view
well it would be nice to have it would

6342
02:01:32,470 --> 02:01:32,480
well it would be nice to have it would
 

6343
02:01:32,480 --> 02:01:34,629
well it would be nice to have it would
be aesthetically pleasing

6344
02:01:34,629 --> 02:01:34,639
be aesthetically pleasing
 

6345
02:01:34,639 --> 02:01:38,390
be aesthetically pleasing
uh will be useful no probably not

6346
02:01:38,390 --> 02:01:38,400
uh will be useful no probably not
 

6347
02:01:38,400 --> 02:01:42,070
uh will be useful no probably not
well i'm i shouldn't no it's dangerous

6348
02:01:42,070 --> 02:01:42,080
well i'm i shouldn't no it's dangerous
 

6349
02:01:42,080 --> 02:01:42,709
well i'm i shouldn't no it's dangerous
to say

6350
02:01:42,709 --> 02:01:42,719
to say
 

6351
02:01:42,719 --> 02:01:45,910
to say
that but uh probably not i think we

6352
02:01:45,910 --> 02:01:45,920
that but uh probably not i think we
 

6353
02:01:45,920 --> 02:01:49,910
that but uh probably not i think we
not not in certainly not in the uh

6354
02:01:49,910 --> 02:01:49,920
not not in certainly not in the uh

02:01:54,239 --> 02:01:54,790
uh maybe to understand black holes yeah
but that's

but that's
 

6361
02:01:54,800 --> 02:01:56,470
but that's
that's yes maybe to understand black

02:05:56,550 --> 02:05:56,560
they would affect technology the uh uh
 

6569
02:05:56,560 --> 02:05:59,750
they would affect technology the uh uh
the because you know to access them you

6570
02:05:59,750 --> 02:05:59,760
the because you know to access them you
 

6571
02:05:59,760 --> 02:06:00,390
the because you know to access them you
need to

6572
02:06:00,390 --> 02:06:00,400
need to
 

6573
02:06:00,400 --> 02:06:03,030
need to
very exotic circumstances to make new

6574
02:06:03,030 --> 02:06:03,040
very exotic circumstances to make new
 

6575
02:06:03,040 --> 02:06:04,550
very exotic circumstances to make new
kinds of particles with high energy you

6576
02:06:04,550 --> 02:06:04,560
kinds of particles with high energy you
 

6577
02:06:04,560 --> 02:06:05,990
kinds of particles with high energy you
need accelerators that are

6578
02:06:05,990 --> 02:06:06,000
need accelerators that are
 

6579
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:07,910
need accelerators that are
you know it's very expensive and you

6580
02:06:07,910 --> 02:06:07,920
you know it's very expensive and you
 

6581
02:06:07,920 --> 02:06:09,430
you know it's very expensive and you
don't produce many many of them and so

6582
02:06:09,430 --> 02:06:09,440
don't produce many many of them and so
 

6583
02:06:09,440 --> 02:06:10,069
don't produce many many of them and so
forth you know

6584
02:06:10,069 --> 02:06:10,079
forth you know
 

6585
02:06:10,079 --> 02:06:12,870
forth you know
it's just uh it's a pipe dream i think

6586
02:06:12,870 --> 02:06:12,880
it's just uh it's a pipe dream i think
 

6587
02:06:12,880 --> 02:06:14,470
it's just uh it's a pipe dream i think
yeah about space exploration

6588
02:06:14,470 --> 02:06:14,480
yeah about space exploration
 

6589
02:06:14,480 --> 02:06:16,870
yeah about space exploration
yes i'm not sure exactly what he has in

6590
02:06:16,870 --> 02:06:16,880
yes i'm not sure exactly what he has in
 

6591
02:06:16,880 --> 02:06:17,990
yes i'm not sure exactly what he has in
mind and

6592
02:06:17,990 --> 02:06:18,000
mind and
 

6593
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:23,109
mind and
but uh to me uh

6594
02:06:23,109 --> 02:06:23,119

 

6595
02:06:23,119 --> 02:06:26,870

it's more a problem of of

6596
02:06:26,870 --> 02:06:26,880

 

6597
02:06:26,880 --> 02:06:37,750

something between biology and

6598
02:06:37,750 --> 02:06:37,760

 

6599
02:06:37,760 --> 02:06:40,069

i think human bodies are not well

6600
02:06:40,069 --> 02:06:40,079
i think human bodies are not well
 

6601
02:06:40,079 --> 02:06:41,030
i think human bodies are not well
adapted

6602
02:06:41,030 --> 02:06:41,040
adapted
 

6603
02:06:41,040 --> 02:06:44,470
adapted
to space even mars

6604
02:06:44,470 --> 02:06:44,480
to space even mars
 

6605
02:06:44,480 --> 02:06:45,910
to space even mars
or even you know which is the closest

6606
02:06:45,910 --> 02:06:45,920
or even you know which is the closest
 

6607
02:06:45,920 --> 02:06:47,830
or even you know which is the closest
thing to a kind of

6608
02:06:47,830 --> 02:06:47,840
thing to a kind of
 

6609
02:06:47,840 --> 02:06:49,430
thing to a kind of
human environment that we're going to

6610
02:06:49,430 --> 02:06:49,440
human environment that we're going to
 

6611
02:06:49,440 --> 02:06:51,189
human environment that we're going to
find anywhere close by

6612
02:06:51,189 --> 02:06:51,199
find anywhere close by
 

6613
02:06:51,199 --> 02:06:54,310
find anywhere close by
uh very very difficult to maintain

6614
02:06:54,310 --> 02:06:54,320
uh very very difficult to maintain
 

6615
02:06:54,320 --> 02:06:55,990
uh very very difficult to maintain
humans on mars

6616
02:06:55,990 --> 02:06:56,000
humans on mars
 

6617
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:59,830
humans on mars
uh and gonna be you know very expensive

6618
02:06:59,830 --> 02:06:59,840
uh and gonna be you know very expensive
 

6619
02:06:59,840 --> 02:07:00,709
uh and gonna be you know very expensive
and very you know

6620
02:07:00,709 --> 02:07:00,719
and very you know
 

6621
02:07:00,719 --> 02:07:04,310
and very you know
very unstable and but i think the pros

6622
02:07:04,310 --> 02:07:04,320
very unstable and but i think the pros
 

6623
02:07:04,320 --> 02:07:08,229
very unstable and but i think the pros
however uh if we

6624
02:07:08,229 --> 02:07:08,239

 

6625
02:07:08,239 --> 02:07:12,870

take a broader view of what it means to

6626
02:07:12,870 --> 02:07:12,880
take a broader view of what it means to
 

6627
02:07:12,880 --> 02:07:17,350
take a broader view of what it means to
bring human civilization

6628
02:07:17,350 --> 02:07:17,360

 

6629
02:07:17,360 --> 02:07:20,470

outside of the earth if we're satisfied

6630
02:07:20,470 --> 02:07:20,480
outside of the earth if we're satisfied
 

6631
02:07:20,480 --> 02:07:20,870
outside of the earth if we're satisfied
with

6632
02:07:20,870 --> 02:07:20,880
with
 

6633
02:07:20,880 --> 02:07:23,270
with
you know sending minds out there that we

6634
02:07:23,270 --> 02:07:23,280
you know sending minds out there that we
 

6635
02:07:23,280 --> 02:07:24,229
you know sending minds out there that we
can

6636
02:07:24,229 --> 02:07:24,239
can
 

6637
02:07:24,239 --> 02:07:27,350
can
converse with and actuators and that

6638
02:07:27,350 --> 02:07:27,360
converse with and actuators and that
 

6639
02:07:27,360 --> 02:07:31,589
converse with and actuators and that
that we can in uh uh manipulate and

6640
02:07:31,589 --> 02:07:31,599
that we can in uh uh manipulate and
 

6641
02:07:31,599 --> 02:07:33,830
that we can in uh uh manipulate and
sensors that we can get feedback from i

6642
02:07:33,830 --> 02:07:33,840
sensors that we can get feedback from i
 

6643
02:07:33,840 --> 02:07:35,910
sensors that we can get feedback from i
think that's

6644
02:07:35,910 --> 02:07:35,920
think that's
 

6645
02:07:35,920 --> 02:07:38,310
think that's
that's where it's at and for sure i

6646
02:07:38,310 --> 02:07:38,320
that's where it's at and for sure i
 

6647
02:07:38,320 --> 02:07:39,430
that's where it's at and for sure i
think that's so much

6648
02:07:39,430 --> 02:07:39,440
think that's so much
 

6649
02:07:39,440 --> 02:07:42,709
think that's so much
so much more realistic and uh

6650
02:07:42,709 --> 02:07:42,719
so much more realistic and uh
 

6651
02:07:42,719 --> 02:07:45,109
so much more realistic and uh
and i think that that's the long-term

6652
02:07:45,109 --> 02:07:45,119
and i think that that's the long-term
 

6653
02:07:45,119 --> 02:07:46,709
and i think that that's the long-term
future of uh

6654
02:07:46,709 --> 02:07:46,719
future of uh
 

6655
02:07:46,719 --> 02:07:48,629
future of uh
the space exploration it's not hauling

6656
02:07:48,629 --> 02:07:48,639
the space exploration it's not hauling
 

6657
02:07:48,639 --> 02:07:50,470
the space exploration it's not hauling
human bodies all over the place and

6658
02:07:50,470 --> 02:07:50,480
human bodies all over the place and
 

6659
02:07:50,480 --> 02:07:53,990
human bodies all over the place and
that's that's that's just silly but

6660
02:07:53,990 --> 02:07:54,000
that's that's that's just silly but
 

6661
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,550
that's that's that's just silly but
it's possible that it's human bodies um

6662
02:07:56,550 --> 02:07:56,560
it's possible that it's human bodies um
 

6663
02:07:56,560 --> 02:07:58,950
it's possible that it's human bodies um
so like you said it's a biology problem

6664
02:07:58,950 --> 02:07:58,960
so like you said it's a biology problem
 

6665
02:07:58,960 --> 02:08:02,229
so like you said it's a biology problem
what's possible is that um we extend

6666
02:08:02,229 --> 02:08:02,239
what's possible is that um we extend
 

6667
02:08:02,239 --> 02:08:03,430
what's possible is that um we extend
human lifespan

6668
02:08:03,430 --> 02:08:03,440
human lifespan
 

6669
02:08:03,440 --> 02:08:06,709
human lifespan
in some way just we have to look at a

6670
02:08:06,709 --> 02:08:06,719
in some way just we have to look at a
 

6671
02:08:06,719 --> 02:08:08,149
in some way just we have to look at a
bigger picture it could be just like

6672
02:08:08,149 --> 02:08:08,159
bigger picture it could be just like
 

6673
02:08:08,159 --> 02:08:09,350
bigger picture it could be just like
you're saying

6674
02:08:09,350 --> 02:08:09,360
you're saying
 

6675
02:08:09,360 --> 02:08:12,550
you're saying
by sending robots with actuators and

6676
02:08:12,550 --> 02:08:12,560
by sending robots with actuators and
 

6677
02:08:12,560 --> 02:08:16,310
by sending robots with actuators and
kind of extending the the our limbs

6678
02:08:16,310 --> 02:08:16,320
kind of extending the the our limbs
 

6679
02:08:16,320 --> 02:08:17,910
kind of extending the the our limbs
but it could also be extending some

6680
02:08:17,910 --> 02:08:17,920
but it could also be extending some
 

6681
02:08:17,920 --> 02:08:20,229
but it could also be extending some
aspect of our minds of information

6682
02:08:20,229 --> 02:08:20,239
aspect of our minds of information
 

6683
02:08:20,239 --> 02:08:22,629
aspect of our minds of information
and it could be cyborgs it could be uh

6684
02:08:22,629 --> 02:08:22,639
and it could be cyborgs it could be uh
 

6685
02:08:22,639 --> 02:08:23,669
and it could be cyborgs it could be uh
it could be

6686
02:08:23,669 --> 02:08:23,679
it could be
 

6687
02:08:23,679 --> 02:08:27,510
it could be
no we're talking it could be you know it

6688
02:08:27,510 --> 02:08:27,520
no we're talking it could be you know it
 

6689
02:08:27,520 --> 02:08:28,709
no we're talking it could be you know it
could

6690
02:08:28,709 --> 02:08:28,719
could
 

6691
02:08:28,719 --> 02:08:32,390
could
it could be uh human brains or

6692
02:08:32,390 --> 02:08:32,400
it could be uh human brains or
 

6693
02:08:32,400 --> 02:08:34,709
it could be uh human brains or
cells that realize something like human

6694
02:08:34,709 --> 02:08:34,719
cells that realize something like human
 

6695
02:08:34,719 --> 02:08:36,390
cells that realize something like human
brain architecture

6696
02:08:36,390 --> 02:08:36,400
brain architecture
 

6697
02:08:36,400 --> 02:08:40,470
brain architecture
uh within uh

6698
02:08:40,470 --> 02:08:40,480
uh within uh
 

6699
02:08:40,480 --> 02:08:42,709
uh within uh
within artificial environments you know

6700
02:08:42,709 --> 02:08:42,719
within artificial environments you know
 

6701
02:08:42,719 --> 02:08:44,310
within artificial environments you know
shells if you like

6702
02:08:44,310 --> 02:08:44,320
shells if you like
 

6703
02:08:44,320 --> 02:08:46,310
shells if you like
that that are more adapted to the

6704
02:08:46,310 --> 02:08:46,320
that that are more adapted to the
 

6705
02:08:46,320 --> 02:08:47,589
that that are more adapted to the
conditions of space

6706
02:08:47,589 --> 02:08:47,599
conditions of space
 

6707
02:08:47,599 --> 02:08:50,870
conditions of space
and uh that yeah so that that's entirely

6708
02:08:50,870 --> 02:08:50,880
and uh that yeah so that that's entirely
 

6709
02:08:50,880 --> 02:08:53,189
and uh that yeah so that that's entirely
man machine hybrids

6710
02:08:53,189 --> 02:08:53,199
man machine hybrids
 

6711
02:08:53,199 --> 02:08:56,790
man machine hybrids
as well as sort of remote uh

6712
02:08:56,790 --> 02:08:56,800
as well as sort of remote uh
 

6713
02:08:56,800 --> 02:08:59,109
as well as sort of remote uh
uh outposts that we can communicate with

6714
02:08:59,109 --> 02:08:59,119
uh outposts that we can communicate with
 

6715
02:08:59,119 --> 02:09:00,870
uh outposts that we can communicate with
i think yeah i think those those will

6716
02:09:00,870 --> 02:09:00,880
i think yeah i think those those will
 

6717
02:09:00,880 --> 02:09:01,510
i think yeah i think those those will
happen

6718
02:09:01,510 --> 02:09:01,520
happen
 

6719
02:09:01,520 --> 02:09:03,910
happen
and uh yeah yeah to me there's some

6720
02:09:03,910 --> 02:09:03,920
and uh yeah yeah to me there's some
 

6721
02:09:03,920 --> 02:09:05,030
and uh yeah yeah to me there's some
sense in which

6722
02:09:05,030 --> 02:09:05,040
sense in which
 

6723
02:09:05,040 --> 02:09:07,189
sense in which
as opposed to understanding the physics

6724
02:09:07,189 --> 02:09:07,199
as opposed to understanding the physics
 

6725
02:09:07,199 --> 02:09:09,830
as opposed to understanding the physics
of

6726
02:09:09,830 --> 02:09:09,840

 

6727
02:09:09,840 --> 02:09:13,750

the the the the fundamental fabric of

6728
02:09:13,750 --> 02:09:13,760
the the the the fundamental fabric of
 

6729
02:09:13,760 --> 02:09:14,870
the the the the fundamental fabric of
the universe

6730
02:09:14,870 --> 02:09:14,880
the universe
 

6731
02:09:14,880 --> 02:09:17,189
the universe
i think getting to the physics of life

6732
02:09:17,189 --> 02:09:17,199
i think getting to the physics of life
 

6733
02:09:17,199 --> 02:09:19,109
i think getting to the physics of life
the physics of intelligence the physics

6734
02:09:19,109 --> 02:09:19,119
the physics of intelligence the physics
 

6735
02:09:19,119 --> 02:09:20,149
the physics of intelligence the physics
of consciousness

6736
02:09:20,149 --> 02:09:20,159
of consciousness
 

6737
02:09:20,159 --> 02:09:23,589
of consciousness
will the physics of information uh

6738
02:09:23,589 --> 02:09:23,599
will the physics of information uh
 

6739
02:09:23,599 --> 02:09:27,750
will the physics of information uh
that that that brings

6740
02:09:27,750 --> 02:09:27,760
that that that brings
 

6741
02:09:27,760 --> 02:09:30,069
that that that brings
from which life emerges that will allow

6742
02:09:30,069 --> 02:09:30,079
from which life emerges that will allow
 

6743
02:09:30,079 --> 02:09:32,069
from which life emerges that will allow
us to do space exploration

6744

yeah well i think physics in the larger

6746
02:09:34,310 --> 02:09:34,320
yeah well i think physics in the larger
 

6747
02:09:34,320 --> 02:09:36,790
yeah well i think physics in the larger
sense has a lot to contribute here

that i think are generally applicable
 

6827
02:11:08,400 --> 02:11:13,430
that i think are generally applicable
one is to cast a wide net

6828

or uh but and and things that you
 

6849
02:11:37,760 --> 02:11:40,390
or uh but and and things that you
in part of what makes things uh

in part of what makes things uh
 

6851
02:11:40,400 --> 02:11:41,109
in part of what makes things uh
attractive

6852
02:11:41,109 --> 02:11:41,119
attractive
 

6853
02:11:41,119 --> 02:11:43,189
attractive
is that whether you thought you liked

6854
02:11:43,189 --> 02:11:43,199
is that whether you thought you liked
 

6855
02:11:43,199 --> 02:11:44,950
is that whether you thought you liked
them or not is this if you can see that

6856
02:11:44,950 --> 02:11:44,960
them or not is this if you can see that
 

6857
02:11:44,960 --> 02:11:46,950
them or not is this if you can see that
there's ferment and new ideas coming up

6858
02:11:46,950 --> 02:11:46,960
there's ferment and new ideas coming up
 

6859
02:11:46,960 --> 02:11:49,270
there's ferment and new ideas coming up
that become that's attractive in itself

6860
02:11:49,270 --> 02:11:49,280
that become that's attractive in itself
 

6861
02:11:49,280 --> 02:11:52,149
that become that's attractive in itself
so uh when i started out i thought i was

6862
02:11:52,149 --> 02:11:52,159
so uh when i started out i thought i was
 

6863
02:11:52,159 --> 02:11:53,510
so uh when i started out i thought i was
and when i was an undergraduate i

6864
02:11:53,510 --> 02:11:53,520
and when i was an undergraduate i
 

6865
02:11:53,520 --> 02:11:55,430
and when i was an undergraduate i
intended to study philosophy or

6866
02:11:55,430 --> 02:11:55,440
intended to study philosophy or
 

6867
02:11:55,440 --> 02:11:57,109
intended to study philosophy or
questions of how mind emerges from

matter but
 

6871
02:11:58,159 --> 02:12:00,149
matter but
i thought that wasn't really right

6872
02:12:00,149 --> 02:12:00,159
i thought that wasn't really right
 

6873
02:12:00,159 --> 02:12:01,910
i thought that wasn't really right
timing isn't right yeah the ripe was the

6874
02:12:01,910 --> 02:12:01,920
timing isn't right yeah the ripe was the
 

6875
02:12:01,920 --> 02:12:03,669
timing isn't right yeah the ripe was the
timing wasn't right for the kind of

6876
02:12:03,669 --> 02:12:03,679
timing wasn't right for the kind of
 

6877
02:12:03,679 --> 02:12:06,990
timing wasn't right for the kind of
mathematical thinking and

6878
02:12:06,990 --> 02:12:07,000
mathematical thinking and
 

6879
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:09,270
mathematical thinking and
conceptualization that i really enjoy

6880
02:12:09,270 --> 02:12:09,280
conceptualization that i really enjoy
 

6881
02:12:09,280 --> 02:12:12,310
conceptualization that i really enjoy
and good at

6882
02:12:12,310 --> 02:12:12,320

 

6883
02:12:12,320 --> 02:12:15,750

but uh so that that's one thing cast a

6884
02:12:15,750 --> 02:12:15,760
but uh so that that's one thing cast a
 

6885
02:12:15,760 --> 02:12:17,510
but uh so that that's one thing cast a
wide net look around

6886
02:12:17,510 --> 02:12:17,520
wide net look around
 

6887
02:12:17,520 --> 02:12:23,589
wide net look around
uh and that's that's

6888
02:12:23,589 --> 02:12:23,599

 

6889
02:12:23,599 --> 02:12:25,830

a pretty easy thing to do today because

6890
02:12:25,830 --> 02:12:25,840
a pretty easy thing to do today because
 

6891
02:12:25,840 --> 02:12:27,830
a pretty easy thing to do today because
because of the internet you can look

6892
02:12:27,830 --> 02:12:27,840
because of the internet you can look
 

6893
02:12:27,840 --> 02:12:29,990
because of the internet you can look
you can look at all kinds of things you

6894
02:12:29,990 --> 02:12:30,000
you can look at all kinds of things you
 

6895
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:31,030
you can look at all kinds of things you
have to be careful though because

6896
02:12:31,030 --> 02:12:31,040
have to be careful though because
 

6897
02:12:31,040 --> 02:12:32,310
have to be careful though because
there's a lot of crap

6898
02:12:32,310 --> 02:12:32,320
there's a lot of crap
 

6899
02:12:32,320 --> 02:12:35,270
there's a lot of crap
also but uh you you know you you can

6900
02:12:35,270 --> 02:12:35,280
also but uh you you know you you can
 

6901
02:12:35,280 --> 02:12:37,270
also but uh you you know you you can
sort of tell the difference if you

6902
02:12:37,270 --> 02:12:37,280
sort of tell the difference if you
 

6903
02:12:37,280 --> 02:12:42,310
sort of tell the difference if you
if you do a little digging uh the the uh

6904
02:12:42,310 --> 02:12:42,320
if you do a little digging uh the the uh
 

6905
02:12:42,320 --> 02:12:44,629
if you do a little digging uh the the uh
so don't don't don't settle on just you

6906
02:12:44,629 --> 02:12:44,639
so don't don't don't settle on just you
 

6907
02:12:44,639 --> 02:12:46,310
so don't don't don't settle on just you
know what your thesis advisor tells you

6908
02:12:46,310 --> 02:12:46,320
know what your thesis advisor tells you
 

6909
02:12:46,320 --> 02:12:47,990
know what your thesis advisor tells you
to do or what your teacher tells you to

6910
02:12:47,990 --> 02:12:48,000
to do or what your teacher tells you to
 

6911
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:51,510
to do or what your teacher tells you to
do look for yourself and and and

6912
02:12:51,510 --> 02:12:51,520
do look for yourself and and and
 

6913
02:12:51,520 --> 02:12:53,510
do look for yourself and and and
get a sense of what what what seems

6914
02:12:53,510 --> 02:12:53,520
get a sense of what what what seems
 

6915
02:12:53,520 --> 02:12:54,550
get a sense of what what what seems
promising

6916
02:12:54,550 --> 02:12:54,560
promising
 

6917
02:12:54,560 --> 02:12:56,950
promising
uh not what seemed promising 10 years

6918
02:12:56,950 --> 02:12:56,960
uh not what seemed promising 10 years
 

6919
02:12:56,960 --> 02:12:59,030
uh not what seemed promising 10 years
ago or

6920
02:12:59,030 --> 02:12:59,040
ago or
 

6921
02:12:59,040 --> 02:13:02,629
ago or
the uh so that's one

6922
02:13:02,629 --> 02:13:02,639
the uh so that's one
 

6923
02:13:02,639 --> 02:13:07,589
the uh so that's one
uh another thing is to

6924
02:13:07,589 --> 02:13:07,599

 

6925
02:13:07,599 --> 02:13:10,390

is kind of complementary to that well

6926
02:13:10,390 --> 02:13:10,400
is kind of complementary to that well
 

6927
02:13:10,400 --> 02:13:12,709
is kind of complementary to that well
they're all complimentary

6928
02:13:12,709 --> 02:13:12,719
they're all complimentary
 

6929
02:13:12,719 --> 02:13:17,510
they're all complimentary
complementary to that uh is to read

6930
02:13:17,510 --> 02:13:17,520
complementary to that uh is to read
 

6931
02:13:17,520 --> 02:13:19,910
complementary to that uh is to read
history and read the masters of the

6932
02:13:19,910 --> 02:13:19,920
history and read the masters of the
 

6933
02:13:19,920 --> 02:13:22,470
history and read the masters of the
history of ideas and masters of ideas i

6934
02:13:22,470 --> 02:13:22,480
history of ideas and masters of ideas i
 

6935
02:13:22,480 --> 02:13:25,990
history of ideas and masters of ideas i
benefited enormously from as

6936
02:13:25,990 --> 02:13:26,000
benefited enormously from as
 

6937
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:29,990
benefited enormously from as
as in early in my career from reading

what it is to wrestle with difficult
 

6953
02:13:46,079 --> 02:13:48,069
what it is to wrestle with difficult
ideas and how great minds did that you

6954
02:13:48,069 --> 02:13:48,079
ideas and how great minds did that you
 

6955
02:13:48,079 --> 02:13:49,510
ideas and how great minds did that you
can learn a lot about

uh style how how to ex write your ideas
up and

6960
02:13:54,470 --> 02:13:54,480
up and
 

6961
02:13:54,480 --> 02:13:57,510
up and
express them in in clear ways

6962
02:13:57,510 --> 02:13:57,520
express them in in clear ways
 

6963
02:13:57,520 --> 02:13:59,990
express them in in clear ways
and also just just a couple that with uh

6964

i also enjoy reading biographies

6966
02:14:02,149 --> 02:14:02,159
i also enjoy reading biographies
 

6967
02:14:02,159 --> 02:14:04,550
i also enjoy reading biographies
and biographies yes similarly right like

6968
02:14:04,550 --> 02:14:04,560
and biographies yes similarly right like
 

6969
02:14:04,560 --> 02:14:06,390
and biographies yes similarly right like
so it gives you the context

6970
02:14:06,390 --> 02:14:06,400
so it gives you the context
 

6971
02:14:06,400 --> 02:14:08,069
so it gives you the context
the context of the human being that

6972
02:14:08,069 --> 02:14:08,079
the context of the human being that
 

6973
02:14:08,079 --> 02:14:09,430
the context of the human being that
created those right and

6974
02:14:09,430 --> 02:14:09,440
created those right and
 

6975
02:14:09,440 --> 02:14:11,270
created those right and
brings it down to earth in the sense

6976
02:14:11,270 --> 02:14:11,280
brings it down to earth in the sense
 

6977
02:14:11,280 --> 02:14:13,270
brings it down to earth in the sense
that you know it was really human beings

6978
02:14:13,270 --> 02:14:13,280
that you know it was really human beings
 

6979
02:14:13,280 --> 02:14:14,709
that you know it was really human beings
who did this it's not

6980
02:14:14,709 --> 02:14:14,719
who did this it's not
 

6981
02:14:14,719 --> 02:14:18,069
who did this it's not
uh and and they made mistakes and

6982
02:14:18,069 --> 02:14:18,079
uh and and they made mistakes and
 

6983
02:14:18,079 --> 02:14:21,109
uh and and they made mistakes and
yeah uh i also you know i also got

6984
02:14:21,109 --> 02:14:21,119
yeah uh i also you know i also got
 

6985
02:14:21,119 --> 02:14:22,950
yeah uh i also you know i also got
inspiration from bertrand russell who's

6986
02:14:22,950 --> 02:14:22,960
inspiration from bertrand russell who's
 

6987
02:14:22,960 --> 02:14:24,149
inspiration from bertrand russell who's
a big hero and h.g

6988
02:14:24,149 --> 02:14:24,159
a big hero and h.g
 

6989
02:14:24,159 --> 02:14:27,350
a big hero and h.g
wells and yeah so uh read read the

masters

6992
02:14:29,030 --> 02:14:29,040
masters
 

6993
02:14:29,040 --> 02:14:31,589
masters
make contact with great minds and when

6994
02:14:31,589 --> 02:14:31,599
make contact with great minds and when
 

6995
02:14:31,599 --> 02:14:32,149
make contact with great minds and when
you are

6996
02:14:32,149 --> 02:14:32,159
you are
 

6997
02:14:32,159 --> 02:14:33,669
you are
sort of narrowing down on a subject

6998
02:14:33,669 --> 02:14:33,679
sort of narrowing down on a subject
 

6999
02:14:33,679 --> 02:14:35,350
sort of narrowing down on a subject
learn about the history of the subject

7000
02:14:35,350 --> 02:14:35,360
learn about the history of the subject
 

7001
02:14:35,360 --> 02:14:36,390
learn about the history of the subject
because

7002
02:14:36,390 --> 02:14:36,400
because
 

7003
02:14:36,400 --> 02:14:38,550
because
that really puts in context what you're

7004
02:14:38,550 --> 02:14:38,560
that really puts in context what you're
 

7005
02:14:38,560 --> 02:14:41,990
that really puts in context what you're
trying to do and

7006
02:14:41,990 --> 02:14:42,000

 

7007
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:43,910

and also gives a sense of community and

7008
02:14:43,910 --> 02:14:43,920
and also gives a sense of community and
 

7009
02:14:43,920 --> 02:14:46,310
and also gives a sense of community and
grandeur to the whole enterprise

7010
02:14:46,310 --> 02:14:46,320
grandeur to the whole enterprise
 

7011
02:14:46,320 --> 02:14:49,750
grandeur to the whole enterprise
uh and then the third piece of advice is

7012
02:14:49,750 --> 02:14:49,760
uh and then the third piece of advice is
 

7013
02:14:49,760 --> 02:14:52,149
uh and then the third piece of advice is
complementary to both those which is

7014
02:14:52,149 --> 02:14:52,159
complementary to both those which is
 

7015
02:14:52,159 --> 02:14:53,109
complementary to both those which is
sort of

02:14:56,310 --> 02:14:56,320
to uh to get
 

7019
02:14:56,320 --> 02:14:59,189
to uh to get
the basics under control as soon as

7020
02:14:59,189 --> 02:14:59,199
the basics under control as soon as
 

7021
02:14:59,199 --> 02:15:00,310
the basics under control as soon as
possible

nowadays you have to be highly computer

7034
02:15:13,669 --> 02:15:13,679
nowadays you have to be highly computer
 

7035
02:15:13,679 --> 02:15:14,709
nowadays you have to be highly computer
literate

literate
 

7037
02:15:14,719 --> 02:15:16,310
literate
uh if you want to do experimental work

7038
02:15:16,310 --> 02:15:16,320
uh if you want to do experimental work
 

7039
02:15:16,320 --> 02:15:17,750
uh if you want to do experimental work
you also have to be computer literate

7040
02:15:17,750 --> 02:15:17,760
you also have to be computer literate
 

7041
02:15:17,760 --> 02:15:19,510
you also have to be computer literate
then you have to learn about electronics

7042
02:15:19,510 --> 02:15:19,520
then you have to learn about electronics
 

7043
02:15:19,520 --> 02:15:20,149
then you have to learn about electronics
and

7044
02:15:20,149 --> 02:15:20,159
and
 

7045
02:15:20,159 --> 02:15:22,950
and
optics and instruments and so so get

7046
02:15:22,950 --> 02:15:22,960
optics and instruments and so so get
 

7047
02:15:22,960 --> 02:15:23,270
optics and instruments and so so get
that

7048

under control as soon as possible
 

7051
02:15:26,639 --> 02:15:29,270
under control as soon as possible
because it's like learning a language uh

7052
02:15:29,270 --> 02:15:29,280
because it's like learning a language uh
 

7053
02:15:29,280 --> 02:15:30,229
because it's like learning a language uh
to do

7058
02:15:36,149 --> 02:15:36,159
yourself fluently and with confidence
 

7059
02:15:36,159 --> 02:15:39,350
yourself fluently and with confidence
uh it should be your native language

7060
02:15:39,350 --> 02:15:39,360
uh it should be your native language
 

7061
02:15:39,360 --> 02:15:40,870
uh it should be your native language
these things should be like your native

7062
02:15:40,870 --> 02:15:40,880
these things should be like your native
 

7063
02:15:40,880 --> 02:15:42,069
these things should be like your native
language so you're not you're not

7064
02:15:42,069 --> 02:15:42,079
language so you're not you're not
 

7065
02:15:42,079 --> 02:15:42,790
language so you're not you're not
wondering

7066
02:15:42,790 --> 02:15:42,800
wondering
 

7067
02:15:42,800 --> 02:15:46,310
wondering
um what is a derivative this is just

7068
02:15:46,310 --> 02:15:46,320
um what is a derivative this is just
 

7069
02:15:46,320 --> 02:15:47,109
um what is a derivative this is just
part of your

7070
02:15:47,109 --> 02:15:47,119
part of your
 

7071
02:15:47,119 --> 02:15:49,750
part of your
you know part it's it's uh it's in your

7072
02:15:49,750 --> 02:15:49,760
you know part it's it's uh it's in your
 

7073
02:15:49,760 --> 02:15:51,750
you know part it's it's uh it's in your
bones so to speak you know

7074
02:15:51,750 --> 02:15:51,760
bones so to speak you know
 

7075
02:15:51,760 --> 02:15:53,589
bones so to speak you know
and the sooner that you can do that then

7076
02:15:53,589 --> 02:15:53,599
and the sooner that you can do that then
 

7077
02:15:53,599 --> 02:15:55,990
and the sooner that you can do that then
the the better so those all those things

7078
02:15:55,990 --> 02:15:56,000
the the better so those all those things
 

7079
02:15:56,000 --> 02:16:01,589
the the better so those all those things
can be done in parallel and should be

7080
02:16:01,589 --> 02:16:01,599

 

7081
02:16:01,599 --> 02:16:02,950

you've accomplished some incredible

7082
02:16:02,950 --> 02:16:02,960
you've accomplished some incredible
 

7083
02:16:02,960 --> 02:16:04,870
you've accomplished some incredible
things in your life but

7084
02:16:04,870 --> 02:16:04,880
things in your life but
 

7085
02:16:04,880 --> 02:16:08,709
things in your life but
uh the sad thing about this

7086
02:16:08,709 --> 02:16:08,719
uh the sad thing about this
 

7087
02:16:08,719 --> 02:16:11,750
uh the sad thing about this
thing we have is it ends uh

7088
02:16:11,750 --> 02:16:11,760
thing we have is it ends uh
 

7089
02:16:11,760 --> 02:16:13,830
thing we have is it ends uh
do you um do you think about your

7090
02:16:13,830 --> 02:16:13,840
do you um do you think about your
 

7091
02:16:13,840 --> 02:16:15,109
do you um do you think about your
mortality

7092
02:16:15,109 --> 02:16:15,119
mortality
 

7093
02:16:15,119 --> 02:16:18,870
mortality
are you afraid of death uh well

7094
02:16:18,870 --> 02:16:18,880
are you afraid of death uh well
 

7095
02:16:18,880 --> 02:16:21,589
are you afraid of death uh well
well afraid is the wrong way i mean uh

7096
02:16:21,589 --> 02:16:21,599
well afraid is the wrong way i mean uh
 

7097
02:16:21,599 --> 02:16:23,109
well afraid is the wrong way i mean uh
let's define things i wish it weren't

7098
02:16:23,109 --> 02:16:23,119
let's define things i wish it weren't
 

7099
02:16:23,119 --> 02:16:23,830
let's define things i wish it weren't
gonna happen

7100
02:16:23,830 --> 02:16:23,840
gonna happen
 

7101
02:16:23,840 --> 02:16:27,189
gonna happen
and i'd like to but uh uh do you think

7102
02:16:27,189 --> 02:16:27,199
and i'd like to but uh uh do you think
 

7103
02:16:27,199 --> 02:16:27,910
and i'd like to but uh uh do you think
about it

7104
02:16:27,910 --> 02:16:27,920
about it
 

7105
02:16:27,920 --> 02:16:30,709
about it
i say occasionally i think about well i

7106
02:16:30,709 --> 02:16:30,719
i say occasionally i think about well i
 

7107
02:16:30,719 --> 02:16:32,549
i say occasionally i think about well i
think about it very operationally in the

7108
02:16:32,549 --> 02:16:32,559
think about it very operationally in the
 

7109
02:16:32,559 --> 02:16:33,270
think about it very operationally in the
sense that

7110
02:16:33,270 --> 02:16:33,280
sense that
 

7111
02:16:33,280 --> 02:16:37,030
sense that
uh there's always a trade-off between

7112
02:16:37,030 --> 02:16:37,040
uh there's always a trade-off between
 

7113
02:16:37,040 --> 02:16:40,389
uh there's always a trade-off between
exploration and exploitation this is a

7114
02:16:40,389 --> 02:16:40,399
exploration and exploitation this is a
 

7115
02:16:40,399 --> 02:16:42,469
exploration and exploitation this is a
classic subject in computer science

7116
02:16:42,469 --> 02:16:42,479
classic subject in computer science
 

7117
02:16:42,479 --> 02:16:44,070
classic subject in computer science
actually in machine learning

7118
02:16:44,070 --> 02:16:44,080
actually in machine learning
 

7119
02:16:44,080 --> 02:16:47,509
actually in machine learning
uh that when you're in an unusual

7120
02:16:47,509 --> 02:16:47,519
uh that when you're in an unusual
 

7121
02:16:47,519 --> 02:16:50,629
uh that when you're in an unusual
circumstance you you want to explore to

7122
02:16:50,629 --> 02:16:50,639
circumstance you you want to explore to
 

7123
02:16:50,639 --> 02:16:51,270
circumstance you you want to explore to
see what

7124
02:16:51,270 --> 02:16:51,280
see what
 

7125
02:16:51,280 --> 02:16:53,429
see what
what the landscape is and what the

7126
02:16:53,429 --> 02:16:53,439
what the landscape is and what the
 

7127
02:16:53,439 --> 02:16:54,549
what the landscape is and what the
gathered data

7128
02:16:54,549 --> 02:16:54,559
gathered data
 

7129
02:16:54,559 --> 02:16:56,790
gathered data
but then at some point you want to use

7130
02:16:56,790 --> 02:16:56,800
but then at some point you want to use
 

7131
02:16:56,800 --> 02:16:57,589
but then at some point you want to use
that

7132
02:16:57,589 --> 02:16:57,599
that
 

7133
02:16:57,599 --> 02:17:00,150
that
make decide make choices and say this is

7134
02:17:00,150 --> 02:17:00,160
make decide make choices and say this is
 

7135
02:17:00,160 --> 02:17:01,509
make decide make choices and say this is
what i'm going to do and exploit the

7136
02:17:01,509 --> 02:17:01,519
what i'm going to do and exploit the
 

7137
02:17:01,519 --> 02:17:03,270
what i'm going to do and exploit the
knowledge you've accumulated

7138
02:17:03,270 --> 02:17:03,280
knowledge you've accumulated
 

7139
02:17:03,280 --> 02:17:07,110
knowledge you've accumulated
and uh the longer

7140
02:17:07,110 --> 02:17:07,120
and uh the longer
 

7141
02:17:07,120 --> 02:17:09,429
and uh the longer
the period of exploitation you

7142
02:17:09,429 --> 02:17:09,439
the period of exploitation you
 

7143
02:17:09,439 --> 02:17:10,309
the period of exploitation you
anticipate

7144
02:17:10,309 --> 02:17:10,319
anticipate
 

7145
02:17:10,319 --> 02:17:13,190
anticipate
the more exploration you should do in

7146
02:17:13,190 --> 02:17:13,200
the more exploration you should do in
 

7147
02:17:13,200 --> 02:17:14,469
the more exploration you should do in
new directions

7148
02:17:14,469 --> 02:17:14,479
new directions
 

7149
02:17:14,479 --> 02:17:17,830
new directions
and so for me i've had to sort of adjust

7150
02:17:17,830 --> 02:17:17,840
and so for me i've had to sort of adjust
 

7151
02:17:17,840 --> 02:17:19,429
and so for me i've had to sort of adjust
the balance of

7152
02:17:19,429 --> 02:17:19,439
the balance of
 

7153
02:17:19,439 --> 02:17:23,429
the balance of
exploration and uh uh

7154
02:17:23,429 --> 02:17:23,439
exploration and uh uh
 

7155
02:17:23,439 --> 02:17:26,469
exploration and uh uh
exploitation and that said you've

7156
02:17:26,469 --> 02:17:26,479
exploitation and that said you've
 

7157
02:17:26,479 --> 02:17:28,070
exploitation and that said you've
explored quite a lot

7158
02:17:28,070 --> 02:17:28,080
explored quite a lot
 

7159
02:17:28,080 --> 02:17:30,709
explored quite a lot
yeah well i i'm still i haven't shut off

7160
02:17:30,709 --> 02:17:30,719
yeah well i i'm still i haven't shut off
 

7161
02:17:30,719 --> 02:17:33,910
yeah well i i'm still i haven't shut off
the exploitation at all i'm still hoping

7162
02:17:33,910 --> 02:17:33,920
the exploitation at all i'm still hoping
 

7163
02:17:33,920 --> 02:17:35,910
the exploitation at all i'm still hoping
the exploration right i'm still hoping

7164
02:17:35,910 --> 02:17:35,920
the exploration right i'm still hoping
 

7165
02:17:35,920 --> 02:17:38,790
the exploration right i'm still hoping
for 10 or 15 years of top flight

7166
02:17:38,790 --> 02:17:38,800
for 10 or 15 years of top flight
 

7167
02:17:38,800 --> 02:17:40,150
for 10 or 15 years of top flight
performance but

7168
02:17:40,150 --> 02:17:40,160
performance but
 

7169
02:17:40,160 --> 02:17:43,429
performance but
the uh

7170
02:17:43,429 --> 02:17:43,439

7177
02:17:49,040 --> 02:17:51,190
i i was at the institute for advanced
study and my office was right under

7178
02:17:51,190 --> 02:17:51,200
study and my office was right under
 

7179
02:17:51,200 --> 02:17:52,870
study and my office was right under
freeman dyson's office and we were kind

7180
02:17:52,870 --> 02:17:52,880
freeman dyson's office and we were kind
 

7181
02:17:52,880 --> 02:17:54,629
freeman dyson's office and we were kind
of friendly and

be exploiting that i but i but but where
i am exploring

7220
02:18:35,750 --> 02:18:35,760
i am exploring
 

7221
02:18:35,760 --> 02:18:37,990
i am exploring
uh in these directions of machine

7222
02:18:37,990 --> 02:18:38,000
uh in these directions of machine
 

7223
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:39,110
uh in these directions of machine
learning and

7224
02:18:39,110 --> 02:18:39,120
learning and
 

7225
02:18:39,120 --> 02:18:40,790
learning and
and things like that and and but then

7226
02:18:40,790 --> 02:18:40,800
and things like that and and but then
 

7227
02:18:40,800 --> 02:18:42,870
and things like that and and but then
but i'm also concentrating

7228
02:18:42,870 --> 02:18:42,880
but i'm also concentrating
 

7229
02:18:42,880 --> 02:18:46,230
but i'm also concentrating
within physics on exploiting directions

7230
02:18:46,230 --> 02:18:46,240
within physics on exploiting directions
 

7231
02:18:46,240 --> 02:18:48,070
within physics on exploiting directions
that i've already established and the

7232
02:18:48,070 --> 02:18:48,080
that i've already established and the
 

7233
02:18:48,080 --> 02:18:49,910
that i've already established and the
laws that we already have

7234
02:18:49,910 --> 02:18:49,920
laws that we already have
 

7235
02:18:49,920 --> 02:18:54,230
laws that we already have
and doing things like uh

7236
02:18:54,230 --> 02:18:54,240
and doing things like uh
 

7237
02:18:54,240 --> 02:18:57,669
and doing things like uh
i'm very actively involved in trying to

7238
02:18:57,669 --> 02:18:57,679
i'm very actively involved in trying to
 

7239
02:18:57,679 --> 02:18:58,150
i'm very actively involved in trying to
design

7240
02:18:58,150 --> 02:18:58,160
design
 

7241
02:18:58,160 --> 02:19:01,509
design
helping people experimentalists and uh

7242
02:19:01,509 --> 02:19:01,519
helping people experimentalists and uh
 

7243
02:19:01,519 --> 02:19:04,549
helping people experimentalists and uh
engineers even to design antennas that

7244
02:19:04,549 --> 02:19:04,559
engineers even to design antennas that
 

7245
02:19:04,559 --> 02:19:06,070
engineers even to design antennas that
are capable of

7246
02:19:06,070 --> 02:19:06,080
are capable of
 

7247
02:19:06,080 --> 02:19:09,990
are capable of
detecting axions so there and that's

7248
02:19:09,990 --> 02:19:10,000
detecting axions so there and that's
 

7249
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:11,990
detecting axions so there and that's
there we're deep in the exploitation

7250
02:19:11,990 --> 02:19:12,000
there we're deep in the exploitation
 

7251
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,230
there we're deep in the exploitation
stage it's not a matter of finding the

7252
02:19:14,230 --> 02:19:14,240
stage it's not a matter of finding the
 

7253
02:19:14,240 --> 02:19:15,349
stage it's not a matter of finding the
new laws but of

7254
02:19:15,349 --> 02:19:15,359
new laws but of
 

7255
02:19:15,359 --> 02:19:17,669
new laws but of
really you know using the laws we have

7256
02:19:17,669 --> 02:19:17,679
really you know using the laws we have
 

7257
02:19:17,679 --> 02:19:18,549
really you know using the laws we have
to to

7258
02:19:18,549 --> 02:19:18,559
to to
 

7259
02:19:18,559 --> 02:19:21,270
to to
to kind of finish the story off so so

7260
02:19:21,270 --> 02:19:21,280
to kind of finish the story off so so
 

7261
02:19:21,280 --> 02:19:23,270
to kind of finish the story off so so
it's complicated but but but

7262
02:19:23,270 --> 02:19:23,280
it's complicated but but but
 

7263
02:19:23,280 --> 02:19:26,950
it's complicated but but but
but i'm you know i'm very happy with my

7264
02:19:26,950 --> 02:19:26,960
but i'm you know i'm very happy with my
 

7265
02:19:26,960 --> 02:19:28,870
but i'm you know i'm very happy with my
life right now and uh

7266
02:19:28,870 --> 02:19:28,880
life right now and uh
 

7267
02:19:28,880 --> 02:19:30,549
life right now and uh
i'm enjoying it and i don't want to

7268
02:19:30,549 --> 02:19:30,559
i'm enjoying it and i don't want to
 

7269
02:19:30,559 --> 02:19:32,309
i'm enjoying it and i don't want to
cloud that by

7270
02:19:32,309 --> 02:19:32,319
cloud that by
 

7271
02:19:32,319 --> 02:19:35,589
cloud that by
thinking too much that that it's uh

7272
02:19:35,589 --> 02:19:35,599
thinking too much that that it's uh
 

7273
02:19:35,599 --> 02:19:39,589
thinking too much that that it's uh
going to come to an end

7274
02:19:39,589 --> 02:19:39,599

 

7275
02:19:39,599 --> 02:19:42,070

you know it's a gift i didn't earn is

7276
02:19:42,070 --> 02:19:42,080
you know it's a gift i didn't earn is
 

7277
02:19:42,080 --> 02:19:43,669
you know it's a gift i didn't earn is
there a good

7278
02:19:43,669 --> 02:19:43,679
there a good
 

7279
02:19:43,679 --> 02:19:48,070
there a good
thing to say about why

7280
02:19:48,070 --> 02:19:48,080
thing to say about why
 

7281
02:19:48,080 --> 02:19:50,469
thing to say about why
this gift that you've gotten and didn't

7282
02:19:50,469 --> 02:19:50,479
this gift that you've gotten and didn't
 

7283
02:19:50,479 --> 02:19:52,870
this gift that you've gotten and didn't
deserve is so damn enjoyable

7284
02:19:52,870 --> 02:19:52,880
deserve is so damn enjoyable
 

7285
02:19:52,880 --> 02:19:55,510
deserve is so damn enjoyable
so like what's the meaning of this thing

7286
02:19:55,510 --> 02:19:55,520
so like what's the meaning of this thing
 

7287
02:19:55,520 --> 02:19:57,110
so like what's the meaning of this thing
of life

7288
02:19:57,110 --> 02:19:57,120
of life
 

7289
02:19:57,120 --> 02:20:00,630
of life
to me interacting with people i love

7290
02:20:00,630 --> 02:20:00,640
to me interacting with people i love
 

7291
02:20:00,640 --> 02:20:03,830
to me interacting with people i love
my family and i have a very wide circle

7292
02:20:03,830 --> 02:20:03,840
my family and i have a very wide circle
 

7293
02:20:03,840 --> 02:20:06,150
my family and i have a very wide circle
of friends now and i'm

7294
02:20:06,150 --> 02:20:06,160
of friends now and i'm
 

7295
02:20:06,160 --> 02:20:08,950
of friends now and i'm
trying to produce some institutions that

7296
02:20:08,950 --> 02:20:08,960
trying to produce some institutions that
 

7297
02:20:08,960 --> 02:20:10,070
trying to produce some institutions that
will survive me

7298
02:20:10,070 --> 02:20:10,080
will survive me
 

7299
02:20:10,080 --> 02:20:14,870
will survive me
as well as my as the work and

7300
02:20:14,870 --> 02:20:14,880

 

7301
02:20:14,880 --> 02:20:18,630

and it's just it's how should i say

7302
02:20:18,630 --> 02:20:18,640
and it's just it's how should i say
 

7303
02:20:18,640 --> 02:20:21,750
and it's just it's how should i say
it's a positive feedback work

7304
02:20:21,750 --> 02:20:21,760
it's a positive feedback work
 

7305
02:20:21,760 --> 02:20:25,030
it's a positive feedback work
loop when you do something and if

7306
02:20:25,030 --> 02:20:25,040
loop when you do something and if
 

7307
02:20:25,040 --> 02:20:27,349
loop when you do something and if
people appreciate it and and then you

7308
02:20:27,349 --> 02:20:27,359
people appreciate it and and then you
 

7309
02:20:27,359 --> 02:20:28,630
people appreciate it and and then you
want to do more and they

7310
02:20:28,630 --> 02:20:28,640
want to do more and they
 

7311
02:20:28,640 --> 02:20:31,830
want to do more and they
get rewarded and it's just uh how should

7312
02:20:31,830 --> 02:20:31,840
get rewarded and it's just uh how should
 

7313
02:20:31,840 --> 02:20:33,590
get rewarded and it's just uh how should
i say this is another gift that i didn't

7314
02:20:33,590 --> 02:20:33,600
i say this is another gift that i didn't
 

7315
02:20:33,600 --> 02:20:35,670
i say this is another gift that i didn't
earn and don't understand but i

7316
02:20:35,670 --> 02:20:35,680
earn and don't understand but i
 

7317
02:20:35,680 --> 02:20:38,790
earn and don't understand but i
i have a dopamine system and

7318
02:20:38,790 --> 02:20:38,800
i have a dopamine system and
 

7319
02:20:38,800 --> 02:20:42,150
i have a dopamine system and
uh yeah i'm happy to use it and

7320
02:20:42,150 --> 02:20:42,160
uh yeah i'm happy to use it and
 

7321
02:20:42,160 --> 02:20:45,910
uh yeah i'm happy to use it and
it seems to get energized by uh

7322
02:20:45,910 --> 02:20:45,920
it seems to get energized by uh
 

7323
02:20:45,920 --> 02:20:47,910
it seems to get energized by uh
by the creative process but yeah process

7324
02:20:47,910 --> 02:20:47,920
by the creative process but yeah process
 

7325
02:20:47,920 --> 02:20:49,590
by the creative process but yeah process
inspiration very much so

7326
02:20:49,590 --> 02:20:49,600
inspiration very much so
 

7327
02:20:49,600 --> 02:20:52,630
inspiration very much so
and all of that started from the

7328
02:20:52,630 --> 02:20:52,640
and all of that started from the
 

7329
02:20:52,640 --> 02:20:54,060
and all of that started from the
little fluctuations

7330
02:20:54,060 --> 02:20:54,070
little fluctuations
 

7331
02:20:54,070 --> 02:20:56,150
little fluctuations

7336
02:21:01,429 --> 02:21:01,439
whatever the those initial conditions
 

7337
02:21:01,439 --> 02:21:03,429
whatever the those initial conditions
and fluctuation did that created you

7338
02:21:03,429 --> 02:21:03,439
and fluctuation did that created you
 

7339
02:21:03,439 --> 02:21:05,990
and fluctuation did that created you
i'm glad they did this is uh thank you

7340
02:21:05,990 --> 02:21:06,000
i'm glad they did this is uh thank you
 

7341
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:07,429
i'm glad they did this is uh thank you
for all the work you've done

7342
02:21:07,429 --> 02:21:07,439
for all the work you've done
 

7343
02:21:07,439 --> 02:21:09,270
for all the work you've done
for the many people you've inspired for

7344
02:21:09,270 --> 02:21:09,280
for the many people you've inspired for
 

7345
02:21:09,280 --> 02:21:11,110
for the many people you've inspired for
the many of the billion

7346

the many of the billion
 

7347
02:21:11,120 --> 02:21:13,349
the many of the billion
most of your ideas were pretty useless

7348
02:21:13,349 --> 02:21:13,359
most of your ideas were pretty useless
 

7349
02:21:13,359 --> 02:21:16,389
most of your ideas were pretty useless
of the bill several billions

7350
02:21:16,389 --> 02:21:16,399
of the bill several billions
 

7351
02:21:16,399 --> 02:21:19,190
of the bill several billions
as it is for all humans but uh you had

7352
02:21:19,190 --> 02:21:19,200
as it is for all humans but uh you had
 

7353
02:21:19,200 --> 02:21:19,910
as it is for all humans but uh you had
quite a few

7354
02:21:19,910 --> 02:21:19,920
quite a few
 

7355
02:21:19,920 --> 02:21:22,550
quite a few
truly special ideas and uh thank you for

7356
02:21:22,550 --> 02:21:22,560
truly special ideas and uh thank you for
 

7357
02:21:22,560 --> 02:21:23,750
truly special ideas and uh thank you for
bringing those to the world and thank

7358
02:21:23,750 --> 02:21:23,760
bringing those to the world and thank
 

7359

it's truly enough it's been a joy and i

7364
02:21:28,710 --> 02:21:28,720
it's truly enough it's been a joy and i
 

7365
02:21:28,720 --> 02:21:31,030
it's truly enough it's been a joy and i
hope people uh

7366
02:21:31,030 --> 02:21:31,040
hope people uh
 

7367
02:21:31,040 --> 02:21:33,990
hope people uh
enjoy it and and and i think you know

7368
02:21:33,990 --> 02:21:34,000
enjoy it and and and i think you know
 

7369
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,150
enjoy it and and and i think you know
the kind of mind expansion that i've

7370
02:21:36,150 --> 02:21:36,160
the kind of mind expansion that i've
 

7371
02:21:36,160 --> 02:21:36,950
the kind of mind expansion that i've
enjoyed

7372
02:21:36,950 --> 02:21:36,960
enjoyed
 

7373
02:21:36,960 --> 02:21:40,150
enjoyed
by interacting with physical reality

7374
02:21:40,150 --> 02:21:40,160
by interacting with physical reality
 

7375
02:21:40,160 --> 02:21:42,070
by interacting with physical reality
at this deep level i think can be

7376
02:21:42,070 --> 02:21:42,080
at this deep level i think can be
 

7377
02:21:42,080 --> 02:21:43,349
at this deep level i think can be
conveyed to and

7378
02:21:43,349 --> 02:21:43,359
conveyed to and
 

7379
02:21:43,359 --> 02:21:45,990
conveyed to and
