00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,290
- The following is a conversation
with Vladimir Vapnik,

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:07,320
part two, the second time
we spoke on the podcast.

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,870
He's the co inventor of
support vector machines,

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,190
support vector clustering, VC theory

5
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:15,010
and many foundational ideas
in statistical learning.

6
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:17,400
He was born in the Soviet Union,

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,330
worked at the Institute of
Control Sciences in Moscow,

8
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:23,514
then in the U.S., worked at ATT&T,

9
00:00:23,514 --> 00:00:26,200
NEC Labs, Facebook AI Research,

10
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,480
and now is a professor
at Columbia University.

11
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,100
His work has been cited
over 200,000 times.

12
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,920
The first time we spoke on the podcast

13
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,030
was just over a year ago,
one of the early episodes.

14
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,797
This time we spoke after
a lecture he gave titled:

15
00:00:41,797 --> 00:00:44,480
"Complete Statistical Theory of Learning,"

16
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,400
as part of the MIT series
of lectures on Deep Learning

17
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,821
and AI that I organized.

18
00:00:49,821 --> 00:00:53,760
I'll release the video of the
lecture in the next few days.

19
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,870
This podcast and the lecture
are independent from each other

20
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:59,460
so you don't need one
to understand the other.

21
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,150
The lecture is quite
technical and math heavy.

22
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:05,180
So if you do watch both,
I recommend listening

23
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:08,690
to this podcast first, since
the podcast is probably

24
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:10,203
a bit more accessible.

25
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,020
This is The Artificial
Intelligence Podcast.

26
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,100
If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,

27
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,970
give it five starts on Apple PodCast,

28
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:21,087
support it on Patreon, or simply
connect with me on Twitter

29
00:01:21,087 --> 00:01:24,820
@LexFridman, spelled: F-R-I-D-M-A-N.

30
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:27,950
As usual, I'll do one or
two minutes of ads now,

31
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:29,840
and never any ads in the
middle that can break

32
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,510
the flow of the conversation.

33
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,670
I hope that works for you and doesn't hurt

34
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:35,023
the listening experience.

35
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,220
This show is presented by Cash App,

36
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,620
the number one finance
app on the App Store.

37
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:42,523
When you get it, use code: LexPodcast.

38
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,870
Cash App lets you send money to friends

39
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:48,170
by BitCoin and invest in the stock market

40
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:49,900
with as little as $1.

41
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,660
Broker services are provided
by Cash App Investing,

42
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:56,510
a subsidiary of Square,
and member S.I.P.C..

43
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:58,770
Since Cash App allows you
to send and receive money

44
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:02,030
digitally peer to peer,
and security in all digital

45
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:04,340
transaction is very
important, let me mention

46
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,447
that PCI data security standard.

47
00:02:06,447 --> 00:02:11,447
PCI DSS Level One, that
Cash App is complaint with.

48
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:15,320
I'm a big fan of standards
for safety and security

49
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,670
and PCI DSS is a good example of that.

50
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:21,050
Where a bunch of competitors got together

51
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:23,520
and agreed that there needs
to be a global standard

52
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,830
around the security of transactions.

53
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:28,930
Now we just need to do the
same for autonomous vehicles

54
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,533
and A.I. systems in general.

55
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,920
So again, if you get Cash
App from the App Store

56
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,363
or Google Play, and use
the code: LexPodcast,

57
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:41,260
you get $10, and Cash App
will also donate $10 to FIRST,

58
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,700
one of my favorite
organizations that is helping

59
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,460
to advance robotics and STEM education

60
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,363
for young people around the world.

61
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:53,303
And now, here's my conversation
with Vladimir Vapnik.

62
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:58,150
You and I talked about
Alan Turing yesterday,

63
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,820
a little bit.
- Yes.

64
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,710
- And that he, as the father
of artificial intelligence

65
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:05,770
may have instilled in our
field an ethic of engineering

66
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:07,720
in that science.

67
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,600
Seeking more to build intelligence

68
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,970
rather than to understand it.

69
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:15,540
What do you think is the
difference between these two paths

70
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:20,493
of engineering intelligence and
the science of intelligence?

71
00:03:21,381 --> 00:03:23,680
- It's a completely different story.

72
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,623
Engineering is imitation
of human activity.

73
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,333
You have to make

74
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:34,253
a device which behaves as a human behaves.

75
00:03:35,587 --> 00:03:39,190
You have all the functions of human.

76
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:42,187
It does not matter how you do it.

77
00:03:42,187 --> 00:03:45,163
But to understand what
is intelligence about,

78
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:47,683
is quite different problem.

79
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,063
So I think, I believe,

80
00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:55,683
that it's somehow related to
predicated talk yesterday.

81
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,773
Because,

82
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:01,223
look at

83
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:05,710
Vladimir Propp's idea.

84
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:10,023
He just found such a one here, predicates.

85
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:15,693
He called it units.

86
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:19,180
Which can explain human behavior,

87
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,993
at least in Russian tales.

88
00:04:22,182 --> 00:04:24,840
You look at the Russian
tales and derive from that.

89
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,180
And then people realize that they're more

90
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,600
violent in Russian tales.

91
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,900
It is in TV, in movie
serials and so on and so on.

92
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,940
- So you're talking about

93
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:39,987
Vladimir Propp, who in
1928 published a book,

94
00:04:39,987 --> 00:04:42,600
"Morphology of the Folk Tale."
- Exactly.

95
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,250
- Describing 31 predicates that

96
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:49,860
have this kind of sequential structure

97
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,900
that a lot of the
stories' narratives follow

98
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,080
in Russian folklore and in other content.

99
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,830
We'll talk about it; I'd
like to talk about predicates

100
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,680
in a focused way, but let
me, if you'll allow me,

101
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,783
to stay zoomed out on
our friend Allen Touring.

102
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,560
And you know, he inspired a generation

103
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,573
with the imitation game.
- Yes.

104
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:15,230
- Do you think, if we can linger
on that a little bit longer

105
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:18,570
do you think we can learn?

106
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:21,170
Do you think learning
to imitate intelligence

107
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:25,163
can get us closer to
understanding intelligence?

108
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:31,030
Why do you think imitation
is so far from understanding?

109
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,630
- I think that it is different

110
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,633
between you have different goals.

111
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:44,120
Your goal is to create
something, something useful.

112
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,960
And that is great,

113
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,970
and you can see how much things was done

114
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:52,343
and I believe that it
will be done even more.

115
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:56,890
Self-driving cars and all
sorts of this business.

116
00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:01,667
It is great, and it was
inspired by Turing's vision.

117
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:05,520
But understanding is very difficult.

118
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,360
It's more or less a
philosophical category.

119
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,973
What means understandable?

120
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:15,153
I believe in things
which start from Plato.

121
00:06:16,017 --> 00:06:19,230
That there exists world of ideas.

122
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:22,960
I believe that intelligence,
it is world of ideas.

123
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,183
But it is world of pure ideas.

124
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:27,723
And when you

125
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:33,410
combine that with reality things,

126
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:36,570
it creates as in my case, in the variants,

127
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:38,450
which is very specific.

128
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:43,220
And that I believe, the combination

129
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:47,720
of ideas and a way to
constructing the variant

130
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:53,565
is intelligence, but
first of all a predicate.

131
00:06:53,565 --> 00:06:57,250
If you know predicate, and hope for this

132
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:01,051
is not too much predicate exists.

133
00:07:01,051 --> 00:07:04,270
For example, sort of
unpredicted for human behavior

134
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:07,940
is not a lot.
- Vladimir Propp used

135
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:12,940
31 (sighs) you could even call
'em predicates, 31 predicates

136
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,750
to describe stories, narratives.

137
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,363
Do you think human behavior,

138
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:23,090
how much of human behavior,
how much of our world,

139
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:27,540
our universe, all the things
that matter in our existence

140
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:30,040
can be summarized in predicates

141
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,650
of the kind that Propp was working with?

142
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:35,330
- I think that we have

143
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,800
a lot of forms of behavior.

144
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,020
But I think the predicate is much less.

145
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:45,250
Because even in these examples
which I gave you yesterday,

146
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,083
you saw

147
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:50,233
that predicate can be,

148
00:07:51,926 --> 00:07:56,720
one, predicate can construct
many different invariants,

149
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,620
depending on your data.

150
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,630
They're applying to different data

151
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:03,870
and they give different invariants.

152
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,403
But pure ideas,

153
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:09,420
maybe not so much.
- Not so many.

154
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,430
- I don't know about that.

155
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:13,570
But my guess, I hope,

156
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:17,700
that's my challenge
about digit recognition,

157
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,773
how much you need.

158
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,880
- I think we'll talk about computer vision

159
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,850
and 2-D images a little
bit in your challenge.

160
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:27,100
- [Vladimir] That's
exact about intelligence.

161
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:31,189
- That's exactly about, no,

162
00:08:31,189 --> 00:08:35,400
that hopes to be exactly about
the spirit of intelligence

163
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,270
in the simplest possible way.
- Yeah, absolutely.

164
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:40,420
You should start the simplest way,

165
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,513
otherwise you will not be able to do it.

166
00:08:42,513 --> 00:08:44,760
- There's an open question whether

167
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,580
starting at the MNIST digit recognition

168
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:51,170
is a step towards intelligence
or it's an entirely

169
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:54,620
different thing.
- I think that to build

170
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:59,620
records using say, 100,
200 times less examples,

171
00:08:59,948 --> 00:09:01,580
you need intelligence.
- You need intelligence.

172
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,820
So let's, because you use this term,

173
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:07,320
and it would be nice,
I'd like to ask simple,

174
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,040
maybe even dumb questions.

175
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,490
Let's start with a predicate.

176
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,990
In terms of terms and
how you think about it,

177
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:16,153
what is a predicate?

178
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,134
- I don't know.

179
00:09:19,134 --> 00:09:20,570
(laughs)
I have a feeling,

180
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:22,093
formally they exist.

181
00:09:25,155 --> 00:09:27,880
I believe that predicate for 2-D images.

182
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:32,310
One of them is symmetry.

183
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:33,682
- Hold on a second.

184
00:09:33,682 --> 00:09:36,470
Sorry, sorry to interrupt
and pull you back.

185
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:40,710
At the simplest level, we're
not being profound currently.

186
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:44,023
A predicate is a statement
of something that is true.

187
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:45,750
- [Vladimir] Yes.

188
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:51,610
- Do you think of predicates
as somehow probabilistic

189
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:54,690
in nature or is this binary?

190
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:59,010
This is truly constraints
of logical statements

191
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:01,320
about the world.
- In my definition,

192
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,190
the simplest predicate is function.

193
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:07,590
Function and you can use this function

194
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:10,870
to make inner product, that is predicate.

195
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:14,020
- What's the input and what's
the output of the function?

196
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:17,773
- Input is X, something
which is input in reality.

197
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,640
Say, if you considered digit
recognition, in pixel space.

198
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:29,790
But it is function which in pixel space.

199
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:34,790
But it can be any function, pixel space.

200
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,150
And you choose, and I believe

201
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:41,700
that there are several functions,

202
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,823
which is important for
understanding of images.

203
00:10:46,693 --> 00:10:50,303
One of them is symmetry, it's
not so simple construction,

204
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:55,010
as I described is the
derivative, it's all this stuff.

205
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:58,860
But another I believe,
I don't know how many,

206
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:02,493
is how well-structurized is picture.

207
00:11:03,571 --> 00:11:04,483
- Structurized?
- Yeah.

208
00:11:04,483 --> 00:11:06,970
- What do you mean by structurized?

209
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:10,070
- It is formal definition, say,

210
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:13,550
something heavy on the left corner,

211
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:17,060
not so heavy in the middle and so on.

212
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:21,870
You describe in general,
concept of what you assume.

213
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:25,230
- Concepts, some kind
of universal concepts.

214
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,710
- Yeah.

215
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:29,173
But I don't know how to formalize this.

216
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,430
- This is the thing,
there's a million ways

217
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:34,880
we can talk about this,
I'll keep bringing it up.

218
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,173
We humans have such concepts,

219
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:41,550
when we look at digits.

220
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,910
But it's hard to put them,
just like you're saying now,

221
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,980
it's hard to put them into words.

222
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,803
- You know, that is example.

223
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,680
When critics

224
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:55,700
in music, trying to describe music,

225
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,123
they use predicate.

226
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:02,900
And not too many predicate
but in different combination.

227
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:07,900
But they have some special
words for describing music.

228
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:12,710
And the same should be for images.

229
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:15,680
But maybe there are critics who understand

230
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:19,653
essence of what this image is about.

231
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:24,490
- Do you think there
exists critics who can

232
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,603
summarize the essence
of images, human beings?

233
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:31,690
- [Vladimir] I hope that, yes.

234
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,963
- Explicitly state them on paper?

235
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,370
The fundamental question I'm asking

236
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:44,280
is do you (chuckles) do
you think there exists

237
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:48,110
a small set of predicates
that will summarize images?

238
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:51,280
It feels to our mind like it does

239
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,517
that the concept of what
makes a two and a three

240
00:12:54,517 --> 00:12:56,510
and a four--
- No, no, no.

241
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,973
It's not only on this level.

242
00:13:01,606 --> 00:13:04,990
It should not describe two, three, four.

243
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:08,810
It describes some
construction which allows you

244
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:10,470
to create an invariants.

245
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:14,190
- And invariants, sorry to stick on this,

246
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:18,410
but terminology.
- Invariants, it is,

247
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:19,243
it is projection

248
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,963
of your image.

249
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,553
Say,

250
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:29,190
I can say, looking at my image,

251
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:32,100
it is more or less symmetric

252
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,200
and I can give you a variable of symmetry.

253
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:39,380
Say, level of symmetry using this function

254
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:41,293
which I gave yesterday.

255
00:13:43,664 --> 00:13:45,220
Then you can describe

256
00:13:48,034 --> 00:13:50,410
that your image

257
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:53,240
has these characteristics
exactly in the way

258
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,823
how musical critics describe music.

259
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:04,080
But this is invariant
applied to specific data,

260
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,973
to specific music, to something.

261
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,590
I strongly believe in

262
00:14:11,456 --> 00:14:12,700
this Plato idea,

263
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:16,893
that exists world of
predicate and world of reality

264
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:20,590
and predicate and reality
are somehow connected

265
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:22,490
and you have to figure out that.

266
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:24,010
- Let's talk about Plato a little bit.

267
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:27,240
So you draw a line from Plato to Hegel

268
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,170
to Wigner to today.
- Yes.

269
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:33,560
- So Plato has forms.

270
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:37,367
The theory of forms;
there's a world of ideas

271
00:14:37,367 --> 00:14:39,407
and a world of things, as you talk about.

272
00:14:39,407 --> 00:14:42,250
And there's a connection,
and presumably the world

273
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:45,830
of ideas is very small,
and the world of things

274
00:14:46,717 --> 00:14:48,770
is arbitrarily big, but they're all,

275
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:50,223
what Plato calls them like,

276
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,030
it's a shadow, the real world is a shadow

277
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:56,880
from the world of form.
- Yeah and you have projection

278
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,240
- Projection.
- Of a world of idea.

279
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,880
- Yeah, very poetic.
- And in reality you can,

280
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:07,050
realize this projection
using these invariants

281
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:11,930
because it is a projection
for only specific examples

282
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:15,113
which create specific
features of specific objects.

283
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,383
- So the essence of intelligence is,

284
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:24,720
while only being able to
observe the world of things,

285
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,130
try to come up with a world of ideas.

286
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:30,120
- Exactly, like in this music story.

287
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,077
Intelligent musical
critics knows this world

288
00:15:33,077 --> 00:15:35,210
and have a feeling about them.
- I feel like

289
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:39,850
that's a contradiction;
intelligent music critics.

290
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:42,380
I think music is to be...

291
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:47,710
enjoyed in all its forms.

292
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:50,040
The notion of critic, like a food critic.

293
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,370
- [Vladimir] No, I don't
want attach emotion.

294
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:53,780
- That's an interesting question.

295
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:56,730
Does emotion, there's certain elements

296
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:59,540
of the human psychology,
of the human experience

297
00:16:01,045 --> 00:16:05,540
which seem to almost contradict
intelligence and reason.

298
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,710
Like emotion, like fear.

299
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:11,450
Like love, all of those things.

300
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:16,343
Are those not connected in
any way to the space of ideas?

301
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:18,877
- This I don't know.

302
00:16:20,606 --> 00:16:21,810
I just want

303
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:26,460
to be concentrating on very simple story.

304
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,980
On digit recognition.

305
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,630
- So you don't think you have to love

306
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:32,830
and fear death in order
to recognize digits?

307
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:36,970
- I don't know because
it's so complicated.

308
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:41,570
It involves a lot of stuff
which I never considered.

309
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:45,365
But I know about digit recognition.

310
00:16:45,365 --> 00:16:48,448
And I know that for digit recognition

311
00:16:52,355 --> 00:16:57,330
to get the records from small
numbers of observations,

312
00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:01,610
you need predicate but
not special predicate

313
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:03,600
for this problem.

314
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,970
But universal predicate which understand

315
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:08,600
world of images.

316
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,410
- Of visual information.
- Visual, yeah.

317
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:14,973
But on the first step, they understand

318
00:17:14,973 --> 00:17:18,570
say, a world of 100 digits

319
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:21,660
or characters or something simple.

320
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,737
- [Lex] So like you said,
symmetry is an interesting one.

321
00:17:23,737 --> 00:17:26,890
- No, that's what I think
one of the predicate

322
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:31,177
is related to symmetry,
the level of symmetry.

323
00:17:31,177 --> 00:17:32,990
- Okay, degree of symmetry.
- Yeah.

324
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:35,840
- So you think symmetry at the bottom

325
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,820
is a universal notion and there's,

326
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,530
there's degrees of a
single kind of symmetry?

327
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:43,540
Or is there many kinds of symmetries?

328
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:46,195
- Many kinds of symmetries.

329
00:17:46,195 --> 00:17:49,750
There is a symmetry/anti-symmetry
say, letter S.

330
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:55,533
So it has vertical anti-symmetry.

331
00:17:58,565 --> 00:18:02,650
It could be diagonal
symmetry, vertical symmetry.

332
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:06,959
- So when you cut
vertically the letter S--

333
00:18:06,959 --> 00:18:09,790
- Yeah, and then

334
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:14,790
the upper part and lower part
are in different directions.

335
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:18,609
- Inverted along the Y-axis.

336
00:18:18,609 --> 00:18:21,466
But that's just like, one
example of symmetry right?

337
00:18:21,466 --> 00:18:23,550
Isn't there like--
- Right, but there

338
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:26,360
is a degree of symmetry.

339
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,230
If you play all this lineated stuff

340
00:18:33,393 --> 00:18:34,900
to do tangent distance,

341
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,939
whatever I described,

342
00:18:36,939 --> 00:18:40,490
you can have a degree of symmetry.

343
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:45,490
And that is what is
describing reason of image.

344
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:49,740
It is the same as you will describe

345
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,550
this image

346
00:18:54,017 --> 00:18:55,360
saying about digit S

347
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,950
has anti-symmetry,

348
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:01,950
digit three is symmetric more/less.

349
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:02,850
Look for symmetry.

350
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:08,560
- Do you think such concepts
like symmetry predicates,

351
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:13,560
like symmetry, is it a
hierarchical set of concepts?

352
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,570
Or are these

353
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,130
independent, distinct predicates

354
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:22,913
that we want to discover a subset of?

355
00:19:23,819 --> 00:19:26,010
- There is a degree of symmetry.

356
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:30,580
And this idea of symmetry made

357
00:19:32,381 --> 00:19:36,243
very general, like degree of symmetry,

358
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,730
the degree of symmetry can
be zero, no symmetry at all.

359
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:43,950
Or degree of symmetry of let's say,

360
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,200
more or less symmetrical.

361
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:50,067
But you have one of these descriptions,

362
00:19:50,067 --> 00:19:52,500
and symmetry can be different.

363
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,743
As I told, horizontal, vertical, diagonal.

364
00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:01,430
Anti-symmetry also is
a concept of symmetry.

365
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:03,350
- What about shape in general?

366
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:05,340
I mean, symmetry is a fascinating notion,

367
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,983
but it--
- No, no, I'm talking about

368
00:20:07,983 --> 00:20:10,520
digits, I would like to concentrate

369
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:14,490
on all I would like to know
predicate for digit recognition.

370
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:18,550
- Yes, but symmetry is not
enough for digit recognition,

371
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,730
right?
- It is not necessarily

372
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:24,480
for digit recognition; it helps

373
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:26,927
to create invariant,

374
00:20:28,892 --> 00:20:32,410
which you can use when
you will have examples

375
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:35,644
for digit recognition.

376
00:20:35,644 --> 00:20:38,200
You have regular problem
of digit recognition.

377
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,630
You have examples of the
first class and second class.

378
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:45,860
Plus you know that there exists
this concept of symmetry.

379
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:50,410
And you apply when you're
looking for decision rule,

380
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:51,640
you will apply

381
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,450
concept of symmetry,

382
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:59,493
of this level of symmetry
which you estimate from.

383
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:03,053
Everything is,

384
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:06,610
comes from weak convergence.

385
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:07,860
- What is convergence?

386
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,280
What is weak convergence?

387
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,690
What is strong convergence?

388
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:13,430
I'm sorry I'm gonna do this to you.

389
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:15,333
What are we converging from and to?

390
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:20,863
- You're converging, you
would like to have a function.

391
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:24,820
The function which say, indicate
a function which indicate

392
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,510
your digit

393
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:31,490
five, for example.
- A classification/task--

394
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:33,780
- Let's talk only about
classification task.

395
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:36,890
- So classification means you will say

396
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:38,640
whether this is a five or not,

397
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,770
or say which of the 10 digits it is.

398
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:42,996
- Right, right, I would like

399
00:21:42,996 --> 00:21:45,603
to have these functions.

400
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,673
Then,

401
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:52,513
I have some examples.

402
00:21:56,060 --> 00:22:00,283
I can consider property of these examples.

403
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,870
Say, symmetry, and I can
measure level of symmetry

404
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:06,543
for every digit.

405
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:11,180
And then I can take average

406
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,700
from my training data.

407
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:19,680
And I will consider only functions

408
00:22:22,664 --> 00:22:24,810
of conditional probability,
which I'm looking

409
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:26,423
for in my decision level.

410
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:28,283
Which

411
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,370
applying to

412
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:38,350
the digits will give me the same average

413
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:40,683
as I observed on training data.

414
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,330
So actually this is different level

415
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:48,500
of description of what you want.

416
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,383
You want,

417
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:54,090
not just, you show not one digit.

418
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:58,370
You show this predicate,
show general property

419
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:03,730
of all digits which you have in mind.

420
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:06,050
If you have in mind digit three,

421
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:09,540
it gives you property of digit three

422
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:13,450
and you select as
admissible set of functions,

423
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:15,803
only function which keeps this property.

424
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:20,750
You will not consider the other functions.

425
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:24,130
So you're immediately
looking for smaller subset

426
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:25,490
of functions.
- That's what you mean

427
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:28,120
by an admissible function.
- And admissible function.

428
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:28,953
Exactly.
- Which is still

429
00:23:28,953 --> 00:23:32,546
a pretty large, for the number three,

430
00:23:32,546 --> 00:23:33,727
that's a large--
- It's large but,

431
00:23:33,727 --> 00:23:36,610
if you have one predicate.

432
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:38,423
But according to,

433
00:23:39,284 --> 00:23:41,903
there is a strong and weak convergence.

434
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,293
Strong convergence if
convergence in function.

435
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:49,250
You're looking for the
function, on one function,

436
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:51,313
and you're looking on another function.

437
00:23:52,724 --> 00:23:54,990
And square difference

438
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:58,303
from them should be small.

439
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:01,860
If you take difference at any points,

440
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:05,640
make a square, make an integral,
and it should be small.

441
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,010
That is convergence in function.

442
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:11,260
Suppose you had some
function, any function.

443
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:15,420
So I would say, I say that some function

444
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,963
converged to this function.

445
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:22,860
If integral from square
difference between them is small--

446
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,720
- That's the definition
of strong convergence.

447
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,388
- That's the definition of--
- Two functions,

448
00:24:26,388 --> 00:24:28,380
the integral of the difference

449
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,469
is small.
- Yeah, it is convergence

450
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:31,453
in functions.
- Yeah.

451
00:24:31,453 --> 00:24:35,803
- But you have different
convergence in functions.

452
00:24:35,803 --> 00:24:39,820
You take any function,
you take some function Fe

453
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:45,123
and take inner product this
function, this F function.

454
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:50,370
F zero function which you want to find,

455
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:51,993
and that gives you some value.

456
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:57,970
So you say that a set of functions

457
00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:03,050
converge in inner product to this function

458
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:08,070
if this value of inner product
converge to value F zero.

459
00:25:09,963 --> 00:25:12,497
That is for one Fe.

460
00:25:12,497 --> 00:25:15,045
But three converges requires

461
00:25:15,045 --> 00:25:19,323
that it converges for any
function of field of space.

462
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:23,850
If it converge for any
function of field of space,

463
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:28,300
then you will say that
this is a weak convergence.

464
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:32,260
You can think that when you take integral,

465
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:35,980
that is property, integral
property of function.

466
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:39,200
For example, if you will
take sine or cosine,

467
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:44,003
it is coefficient of say, free expansion.

468
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:47,530
If it converged

469
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:52,030
for all coefficients or free expansion,

470
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:55,360
so under some condition it converged

471
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,393
to function you're looking for.

472
00:25:58,947 --> 00:26:01,243
But weak convergence means any property.

473
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,870
Not convergence, not point-wise.

474
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:08,653
But integral property of function.

475
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:13,870
So weak convergence means
integral property of functions.

476
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:17,460
When I'm talking about
predicate, I would like to

477
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:22,100
formulate which integral properties

478
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:26,693
I would like to have for convergence.

479
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:32,290
And if I will take one predicate,

480
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:35,563
predicate its function
which I measure property.

481
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:40,620
If I will use one predicate and say,

482
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:44,970
I will consider only
function which give me

483
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:49,970
the same value as this
predicate, I select a set

484
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:54,970
of functions from functions
which is admissible,

485
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:58,390
in the sense that
function which I'm looking

486
00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:01,060
for in this set of functions.

487
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:06,000
Because I'm checking in training data,

488
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,623
it gives the same.

489
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,330
- [Lex] Yeah, so it
always has to be connected

490
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:12,670
to the training data in terms of--

491
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:14,898
- Yeah, but property,

492
00:27:14,898 --> 00:27:18,830
you can know independent of training data.

493
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:20,437
And this guy, Propp,

494
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:24,020
says that there is formal property.

495
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,972
31 property and if you--
- A fairy tale,

496
00:27:25,972 --> 00:27:27,665
the Russian fairy tale.
- Right.

497
00:27:27,665 --> 00:27:30,480
But the Russian fairy tale
is not so interesting.

498
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,620
It's more interesting
that people applied this

499
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:35,690
to movies, to theater,

500
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:40,430
to different things and the same works.

501
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:41,513
They're universal.

502
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,850
- So I would argue that
there's a little bit

503
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:46,147
of a difference between

504
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,310
the kinds of things that would apply to,

505
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:53,423
which are essentially stories
and digit recognition.

506
00:27:54,501 --> 00:27:55,970
- [Vladimir] It is the same story.

507
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:59,690
- You're saying digits, there's
a story within the digit?

508
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:01,410
- Yeah.
(laughing)

509
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:03,790
So but my point is,

510
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:08,600
well, I hope that it's
possible to beat a record.

511
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,570
Using not 60,000

512
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,860
but say, 100 times less.

513
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:16,373
Because instead you will give predicates.

514
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:21,420
And you will select your decision not

515
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:24,330
from right set of functions.

516
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:27,193
But from set of function
which gives this predicate.

517
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:32,840
But predicate is not related
just to digit recognition.

518
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:36,090
- Right, so--
- Like in Plato's case.

519
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:38,940
- (laughs) Do you think it's possible

520
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:42,150
to automatically discover the predicates?

521
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:44,390
So, you basically said

522
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:46,620
that the essence of intelligence

523
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:49,650
is the discovery of good predicates.

524
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:51,350
- [Vladimir] Yeah.

525
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:53,623
- Now the natural question is,

526
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:58,210
you know, that's what Einstein
was good at doing in physics.

527
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:02,410
Can we make machines do these kinds

528
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:04,560
of discovery of good predicates?

529
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,853
Or is this ultimately a human endeavor?

530
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,610
- That I don't know.

531
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:11,430
I don't think that much it can do.

532
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:12,273
Because,

533
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:17,553
according to theory
about weak convergence,

534
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:22,163
any function from Hilbert
Space can be predicate.

535
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:27,290
So you have infinite number
of predicate in upper.

536
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:32,290
And before you don't know which
predicate is good in which.

537
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:35,090
But whatever

538
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:39,910
Propp showed, and why
people call it breakthrough,

539
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:44,770
that there is not too many predicate

540
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:48,713
which cover most of situation
that happen in the world.

541
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:53,353
- So there's a sea of predicates.

542
00:29:54,576 --> 00:29:58,830
Only a small amount are
useful for the kinds of things

543
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,080
that happen in the world?

544
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:02,760
- I think that,

545
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,410
I would say only a small part

546
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:08,740
of predicates very useful.

547
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:11,928
Useful, all of them.
- Only a very few

548
00:30:11,928 --> 00:30:15,470
are what we should, let's
call them good predicates.

549
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:17,873
- Very good predicates.
- Very good predicates.

550
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,790
Can we linger on it,
what's your intuition?

551
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:23,120
Why is it

552
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,620
hard for a machine to
discover good predicates?

553
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:30,740
- Even in my talk described
how to do a predicate.

554
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:33,487
How to find new predicates, I'm not sure

555
00:30:33,487 --> 00:30:35,020
that it is very good predicate.

556
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:37,290
- [Lex] What did you propose in your talk?

557
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:42,020
- In my talk I gave example for diabetes.

558
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:46,230
- Diabetes, yeah.
- When we achieve some percent

559
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:48,523
so then we're looking from area,

560
00:30:50,951 --> 00:30:53,743
where some sort of predicate
which I formulated,

561
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,760
does not...

562
00:30:58,712 --> 00:30:59,545
keep

563
00:31:01,042 --> 00:31:01,875
invariant.

564
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:07,010
So if it doesn't keep, I retrain my data.

565
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:10,777
I select only functions
which keep this invariant.

566
00:31:10,777 --> 00:31:14,510
In the way I did it, I
improved my performance.

567
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:16,520
I came looking for this predicate.

568
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:19,770
I know technically how to do that.

569
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:21,880
You can of course

570
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:27,330
do it using a machine, but I'm not sure

571
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:30,613
that we will construct
the smartest predicate.

572
00:31:30,613 --> 00:31:34,210
- Well this is the,
allow me to linger on it.

573
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:36,310
Because that's the essence,
that's the challenge.

574
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:40,370
That is artificial, that's
the human-level intelligence

575
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:43,840
that we seek, is the discovery
of these good predicates.

576
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,490
You've talked about deep
learning as a way to,

577
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:52,490
the predicates they use and
the functions are mediocre.

578
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:55,070
Or you can find better ones.

579
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:57,360
- Let's talk about deep learning.

580
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,750
- Sure, let's do it.
- I know only Jans LaComb,

581
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:05,524
convolutional network, and what else?

582
00:32:05,524 --> 00:32:07,940
And it's very simple convergence.

583
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,701
- [Lex] There's not much else to know.

584
00:32:09,701 --> 00:32:10,534
- To fix it left and right.
- Yes.

585
00:32:10,534 --> 00:32:14,353
- I can do it like that
with one predicate.

586
00:32:14,353 --> 00:32:16,660
- [Lex] Convolution is a single predicate.

587
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:17,493
- It's single,

588
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:21,762
it's single predicate.
- Yes, but--

589
00:32:21,762 --> 00:32:25,490
- You know exactly,
you take the derivative

590
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:29,943
for translational, and
predicate should be kept.

591
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:33,770
- So that's a single predicate,
but humans discovered

592
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:37,248
that one or at least--
- Not that that is the least

593
00:32:37,248 --> 00:32:39,040
not too many predicates.

594
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:43,750
And that is big story because
Jan did it 25 years ago,

595
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:48,750
and nothing so clear was
uttered to deep network.

596
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:53,240
And then I don't understand

597
00:32:54,118 --> 00:32:57,420
why we should talk about deep network

598
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:01,270
instead of talking about
piece-wise linear functions

599
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:03,123
which keeps this predicate.

600
00:33:03,123 --> 00:33:06,133
- You know, a counter argument is,

601
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:11,170
that maybe the amount
of predicates necessary

602
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:16,170
to solve general intelligence,
say in the space of images,

603
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:20,620
doing efficient recognition
of handwritten digits

604
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:21,633
is very small.

605
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:26,850
So we shouldn't be so
obsessed about finding,

606
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:28,693
we'll find other good predicates

607
00:33:28,693 --> 00:33:30,920
like convolution, for example.

608
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:34,412
There has been other advancements like,

609
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:37,410
if you look at the work with attention,

610
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:39,043
there's attentional mechanisms,

611
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:42,150
especially used in natural language

612
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:44,477
focusing the network's ability to,

613
00:33:44,477 --> 00:33:47,640
to learn at which part
of the input to look at.

614
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:51,050
The thing is, there's other
things besides predicates

615
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:55,270
that are important for the
actual engineering mechanism

616
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:58,070
of showing how much you can really do,

617
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:00,820
given such these predicates.

618
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:04,360
I mean, that's essentially
the work of deep learning

619
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:08,010
is constructing
architectures that are able

620
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:13,010
to be given the training data
to be able to converge towards

621
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:19,720
a function that can approximate,

622
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,363
that can generalize well.

623
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:26,130
It's an engineering problem.
- Yeah, I understand.

624
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:27,360
But let's talk

625
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:31,890
not on an emotional level,
but on a mathematical level.

626
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:36,440
You have set of piece-wise
linear functions,

627
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:40,143
it is all possible neural networks.

628
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:44,003
It's just piece-wise linear functions.

629
00:34:44,003 --> 00:34:46,630
It's many, many pieces.
- Large, large number

630
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:48,600
of piece-wise linear function.
- Exactly.

631
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,170
- Very large.
- Very large.

632
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:51,780
- [Lex] Almost, feels like too large.

633
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:55,530
- It's still simpler
than say, convolution,

634
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:58,213
which is reproducing Hilbert's Space

635
00:34:58,213 --> 00:35:00,900
and we have a Hilbert's set of functions.

636
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:03,020
- What's Hilbert Space?

637
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:06,783
- It's space with infinite
number of coordinates.

638
00:35:09,027 --> 00:35:11,800
A function for expansion,
something like that.

639
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,463
So it's much richer.

640
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:17,607
And when I'm talking about
closed-form solution,

641
00:35:17,607 --> 00:35:20,830
I'm talking about this set of functions.

642
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:25,083
Not piece-wise linear set,
which is particular case

643
00:35:26,341 --> 00:35:30,840
of (chuckles) it is small part of it.

644
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,990
- So neural networks is a small part

645
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:36,384
of the space you're, of
functions you're talking about?

646
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:39,180
- Small set of functions.
- Yeah.

647
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,567
- Let me take it that.

648
00:35:40,567 --> 00:35:42,760
But it is fine, it is fine.

649
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:47,760
I don't want to discuss the
small or big we take and what.

650
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:50,113
So you have some set of functions.

651
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,363
So now when you're trying
to create architecture,

652
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:58,870
you would like to create
admissible set of functions,

653
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:03,370
which all your tricks,
to use not all functions,

654
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:06,003
but some subset of this set of functions.

655
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,120
Say when you're introducing
convolutional network.

656
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:13,003
It is a way to

657
00:36:13,003 --> 00:36:16,082
make this subset useful for you.

658
00:36:16,082 --> 00:36:19,820
But from my point of view, convolutional,

659
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:24,820
it is something, you want
to keep some invariance.

660
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:26,250
Say, translation invariance.

661
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:31,840
But now if you understand this,

662
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:35,530
and you cannot explain

663
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:39,493
on the level of ideas
what neural network does,

664
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:42,150
you should agree

665
00:36:43,457 --> 00:36:46,730
that it is much better to
have a set of functions.

666
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:51,140
As I say, this set of
functions should be admissible,

667
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:53,740
it must keep this
invariant, this invariant,

668
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:55,250
and that invariant.

669
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:58,867
You know that as soon as you
incorporate new invariants,

670
00:36:58,867 --> 00:37:02,140
set of functions becomes
smaller and smaller and smaller.

671
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:03,400
- [Lex] But all the invariants

672
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,533
are specified by you the human.

673
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:09,690
- Yeah, but what I am hope,

674
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:13,923
that there is a standard
predicate like, Propp showed.

675
00:37:15,727 --> 00:37:19,630
That's what I want to find
for digit recognition.

676
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:22,680
If we start, it is completely new area

677
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,830
of what is intelligence
about on the level,

678
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:28,830
starting from Plato's idea.

679
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:30,613
What is the world of ideas?

680
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,803
And I believe there is not too many.

681
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:39,250
But you know, it is
amusing that mathematicians

682
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:44,030
are doing something with neural
network in general function.

683
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:47,634
But people from literature, from art,

684
00:37:47,634 --> 00:37:49,622
they use this all the time.

685
00:37:49,622 --> 00:37:52,770
- That's right.
- Invariants.

686
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:57,020
Say, it is great how
people describe music.

687
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:59,060
We should learn from that.

688
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:02,420
Something on this level.

689
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:07,420
So why, Vladimir Propp
who was just theoretical.

690
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:12,253
Who studied theoretical
literature, he found that.

691
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:15,240
- You know what, let me
throw that right back at you.

692
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,370
Because there's a little bit of a,

693
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:20,090
that's less mathematical
and more emotional,

694
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:21,743
philosophical Vladimir Propp.

695
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:25,453
I mean, he wasn't doing math.
- No.

696
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:30,140
- And you just said another
emotional statement,

697
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:32,040
which is you believe that

698
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,883
this Plato world of ideas is small.

699
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,653
- I hope.
- I hope.

700
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,860
Do (chuckles), do you,

701
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,560
what's your intuition, though,
if we can linger on it?

702
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,470
That bothers me.
- You know, because not

703
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:48,650
just small or big.

704
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:50,123
I know exactly.

705
00:38:51,387 --> 00:38:52,980
That when I'm introducing

706
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,953
some predicate, I
decrease set of functions.

707
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,983
But my goal to decrease
set of functions much.

708
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:06,690
- By as much as possible.
- By as much as possible.

709
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:11,130
Good predicate which does this,

710
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:14,250
then I should choose next
predicate which does this,

711
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:17,280
which decreases set as much as possible.

712
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,520
So, set of good predicates,

713
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:23,123
it is such that the decrease,

714
00:39:24,717 --> 00:39:27,830
amount of admissible functions--

715
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:31,060
- So if each good predicate
significantly reduces

716
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,660
the set of admissible functions

717
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:35,600
that there naturally should
not be that many predicates.

718
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,493
- No, but,

719
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:43,560
if you reduce very well the
VC dimension of the function

720
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:46,860
of admissible set of
functions, it's small.

721
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:51,263
And you need not too much
training data to do well.

722
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,360
- [Lex] And VC dimension, by the way,

723
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,730
is some measure of capacity
of this set of functions.

724
00:39:57,730 --> 00:40:02,010
- Right, roughly speaking,
how many function in this set.

725
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:03,980
So you're decreasing, decreasing,

726
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:06,470
and it makes it easier for you

727
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:09,143
to find the function you're looking for.

728
00:40:10,525 --> 00:40:12,750
But the most important part,

729
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:15,630
to create a good admissible
set of functions.

730
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:19,453
And it probably is that
there are many ways but,

731
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:25,163
a good predicate is such
that it can do that.

732
00:40:26,391 --> 00:40:28,490
For this duck,

733
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:30,713
you should know a little bit about duck.

734
00:40:31,552 --> 00:40:35,340
- What are the three
fundamental laws of ducks?

735
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:37,470
- Looks like a duck, swims like a duck,

736
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:38,410
and quacks like a duck.
- And quacks.

737
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:40,750
You should know something about ducks

738
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:42,170
to be able to--
- Not necessarily.

739
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:45,090
Looks like say, horse.

740
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:46,600
It's also good.

741
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,890
- [Lex] So it's not (chuckles),

742
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:50,841
it generalize from ducks.
- Yes, and talk like it,

743
00:40:50,841 --> 00:40:54,360
and make sound like horse or something.

744
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:57,390
And run like horse and moves like horse.

745
00:40:57,390 --> 00:41:01,210
It is general, it is general predicate

746
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:04,660
that this applies to duck.

747
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:08,653
But for duck you can say,
play chess like duck.

748
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:11,680
- [Lex] You cannot say,
play chess like a duck.

749
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,070
- Why not?
- So you're saying you can

750
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:15,800
but that that would not be a good--

751
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,554
- [Vladimir] No, you will
not reduce that function.

752
00:41:18,554 --> 00:41:21,700
- Yeah, you would not
reduce the set of functions.

753
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:25,239
- So you can, the story is formal story

754
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:28,077
and it's a magical story
is that you can use

755
00:41:28,077 --> 00:41:30,343
any function you want as a predicate.

756
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:33,210
But some of them are good,
some of them are not.

757
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:36,223
Because some of them
reduce a lot of functions.

758
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:40,300
The admissible set, some of them (mumbles)

759
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:42,150
- So the question is, and
I'll probably keep asking

760
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:45,740
this question, but how do
we find such predicates?

761
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:47,420
What's your intuition?

762
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:50,111
Handwritten recognition, how do we find

763
00:41:50,111 --> 00:41:52,990
the answer to your challenge?

764
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:55,990
- Yeah, I understand it like that.

765
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:57,920
I understand what.

766
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,230
- What defined?
- What that means,

767
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:02,810
a new predicate.
- Yeah.

768
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:05,140
- Like, guy who understands music

769
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:07,510
can say these words he describes

770
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:09,003
when he listens to music.

771
00:42:09,913 --> 00:42:13,670
He understands music, he'll
use not too many different.

772
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:15,570
Or you can do it like Propp.

773
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:18,888
You can make collection, what
you're talking about music.

774
00:42:18,888 --> 00:42:20,703
About this, about that.

775
00:42:20,703 --> 00:42:25,020
It's not too many different
situations you describe.

776
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:26,960
- Because we mentioned
Vladimir Propp a bunch,

777
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:31,380
let me just mention, so
there's a sequence of 31

778
00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:36,930
structural notions that
are common in stories.

779
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:38,600
And I think--
- They're called units.

780
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,490
- Units, and I think they resonate.

781
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:43,406
It starts, just to give an example,

782
00:42:43,406 --> 00:42:46,080
Absention: a member of
the hero's community

783
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,960
or family leaves the security
of the home environment,

784
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,100
then goes through the interdiction,

785
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:54,560
a forbidding edict or command
that's passed upon the hero.

786
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,680
Don't go there; don't do this.

787
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,720
The hero's warned against some action.

788
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:02,507
Then step three:
Violation of interdiction.

789
00:43:03,386 --> 00:43:07,630
You know, break the rules,
break out on your own.

790
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:10,440
Then reconnaissance, the
villain makes an effort

791
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:13,200
to attain knowledge needed
to fulfill their plot, so on.

792
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,393
It goes on like this.

793
00:43:16,222 --> 00:43:20,943
Ends in a wedding, number
31, happily every after.

794
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:25,980
- He just gave description
of all situations.

795
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:28,948
He understands his world--
- Of folk tales.

796
00:43:28,948 --> 00:43:31,029
- Yeah, not folk--
- Stories.

797
00:43:31,029 --> 00:43:36,029
- Stories, and these stories
not just in folk tales.

798
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:40,003
These stories in
detective serials as well.

799
00:43:40,930 --> 00:43:42,270
- [Lex] And probably in our lives.

800
00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:44,553
We probably live--
- Read this.

801
00:43:46,498 --> 00:43:47,498
They're all,

802
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:53,493
this predicate is good
for different situations.

803
00:43:55,461 --> 00:43:58,330
For movie, for theater.
- By the way,

804
00:43:58,330 --> 00:44:00,680
there's also criticism, right?

805
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:03,870
There's another way to
interpret narratives.

806
00:44:03,870 --> 00:44:04,840
From...

807
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:12,530
Claude Levi Strauss.
- I am not in this business.

808
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:14,390
- I know, that's theoretical literature,

809
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:15,820
but it's looking at paradigms behind them.

810
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:18,200
- [Vladimir] It's
always, this discussion--

811
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:19,763
- Philosophers argue.
- Yeah.

812
00:44:20,609 --> 00:44:23,820
- Yeah.
- But at least there is units.

813
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:27,200
It's not too many units that can describe.

814
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:30,860
But describe probably
gives the other units.

815
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:31,790
Or another way for description.

816
00:44:31,790 --> 00:44:33,900
- Exactly, another set of units.

817
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:36,210
- [Vladimir] Another
set of predicates, yes.

818
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:40,923
It doesn't matter how,
but they exist probably.

819
00:44:41,984 --> 00:44:46,250
- My question is, whether
given those units,

820
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:49,513
whether without our human
brains to interpret these units,

821
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:53,500
they would still hold as
much power as they have.

822
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:57,080
Meaning, are those units
enough when we give them

823
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:58,870
to the alien species?

824
00:44:58,870 --> 00:45:01,390
- Let me ask you, do you understand

825
00:45:03,438 --> 00:45:05,852
digit images?

826
00:45:05,852 --> 00:45:07,920
- No, I don't understand.
- No, no, no.

827
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:11,010
When you can recognize these digit images,

828
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:12,493
it means that you understand.

829
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,390
- Yes, I understand.
- You understand

830
00:45:15,390 --> 00:45:18,973
characters, you understand.
- Nope, nope, nope, nope.

831
00:45:22,613 --> 00:45:25,500
It's the imitation versus
understanding question.

832
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:28,390
Because I don't understand the mechanism

833
00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:29,500
by which I understand--
- No, no.

834
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:32,780
I'm not talking about, I'm
talking about predicates.

835
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:35,150
You understand that it involves symmetry,

836
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:37,753
maybe structure, maybe something else.

837
00:45:37,753 --> 00:45:40,296
I cannot formulate, I just was able

838
00:45:40,296 --> 00:45:43,843
to find symmetries, or
degree of symmetries.

839
00:45:43,843 --> 00:45:46,129
- So this is a good line.

840
00:45:46,129 --> 00:45:50,156
I feel like I understand
the basic elements

841
00:45:50,156 --> 00:45:54,330
of what makes a good hand
recognition system my own.

842
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:56,460
Like, symmetry connects with me.

843
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:59,160
It seems like that's a
very powerful predicate.

844
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:02,410
My question is, is there
a lot more going on

845
00:46:02,410 --> 00:46:04,523
that we're not able to introspect?

846
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:09,640
Maybe I need to be able to understand

847
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:13,083
a huge amount in the world of ideas.

848
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:18,420
Thousands of predicates,
millions of predicates

849
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:20,600
in order to do hand recognition.

850
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:23,639
- [Vladimir] I don't think so.

851
00:46:23,639 --> 00:46:26,870
- Both your hope and your intuition

852
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:28,990
are such that very few--
- No, no, let me explain.

853
00:46:28,990 --> 00:46:31,640
You're using digits.

854
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:33,543
You're using examples as well.

855
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:37,690
Theory says that if you will use

856
00:46:40,052 --> 00:46:44,680
all possible functions from Hilbert Space,

857
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:47,903
all possible predicates, you
don't need training data.

858
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:53,406
You just will have
admissible set of functions

859
00:46:53,406 --> 00:46:57,150
which contain one function.
- Yes.

860
00:46:57,150 --> 00:47:01,160
So the trade off is, when
you're not using all predicates,

861
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:02,653
you're only using a few good predicates,

862
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:05,040
that you need to have some training data.

863
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,850
- Yes, exactly.
- The more good predicates

864
00:47:07,850 --> 00:47:09,616
you have, the less training data

865
00:47:09,616 --> 00:47:11,184
you need.
- Exactly.

866
00:47:11,184 --> 00:47:14,020
That is intelligent learning.

867
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:17,440
- Okay, I'm gonna keep asking
the same dumb question,

868
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:20,270
handwritten recognition,
to solve the challenge,

869
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:21,960
you kind of propose a challenge that says

870
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:26,960
we should be able to get state
of the art MNIST error rates

871
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:31,343
by using very few, 60 maybe
few examples per digit.

872
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:35,493
What kind of predicates
do you think you'll--

873
00:47:35,493 --> 00:47:37,352
- [Vladimir] That is the challenge.

874
00:47:37,352 --> 00:47:38,388
(laughs)

875
00:47:38,388 --> 00:47:39,830
So people who will solve this problem.

876
00:47:39,830 --> 00:47:41,527
- They will answer.
- They will answer it.

877
00:47:41,527 --> 00:47:44,780
- Do you think they'll
be able to answer it

878
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:46,583
in a human explainable way?

879
00:47:48,045 --> 00:47:50,820
- They just need the
right function, that's it.

880
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:54,040
- But so, can that
function be written I guess

881
00:47:55,524 --> 00:47:58,740
by an automated reasoning system?

882
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:01,140
Whether we're talking
about a neural network

883
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:05,090
learning a particular
function, or another mechanism.

884
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:08,570
- No, I'm not against neural network.

885
00:48:08,570 --> 00:48:11,620
I am against admissible set of function

886
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:13,070
which creates neural network.

887
00:48:14,114 --> 00:48:15,243
You did it by hand.

888
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:20,799
You don't do it by invariants,

889
00:48:20,799 --> 00:48:23,383
by predicate, by reason.

890
00:48:24,630 --> 00:48:26,410
- But neural networks can then reverse,

891
00:48:26,410 --> 00:48:29,963
to the reverse step of
helping you find a function.

892
00:48:30,999 --> 00:48:34,604
The task of a neural network is to find

893
00:48:34,604 --> 00:48:39,120
disentangled representation,
for example is what they call,

894
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:42,140
is to fine that one predicate function

895
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:45,462
that's really captures
some kind of essence.

896
00:48:45,462 --> 00:48:48,640
Not the entire essence,
but one very useful essence

897
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:52,690
of this particular visual space.

898
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:54,140
Do you think that's possible?

899
00:48:55,470 --> 00:48:58,660
Listen, I'm grasping, hoping
there's an automated way

900
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:00,330
to find good predicates, right?

901
00:49:00,330 --> 00:49:03,030
So the question is,
what are the mechanisms

902
00:49:03,030 --> 00:49:05,730
of finding good predicates, ideas,

903
00:49:05,730 --> 00:49:08,080
that you think we should pursue?

904
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:10,130
A young grad student listening right now.

905
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:13,400
- I gave example.

906
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:17,300
So find situation where

907
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:21,553
predicate, which you're suggesting,

908
00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:25,237
don't create invariant.

909
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:30,910
It's like in physics, find situation

910
00:49:30,910 --> 00:49:34,393
where existing theory cannot explain it.

911
00:49:36,815 --> 00:49:39,394
- [Lex] Find a situation
where the existing theory

912
00:49:39,394 --> 00:49:40,970
can't explain it.
- Cannot explain this.

913
00:49:40,970 --> 00:49:42,770
- [Lex] So you're finding contradictions.

914
00:49:42,770 --> 00:49:46,140
- Find contradiction, and then
remove this contradiction.

915
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:48,930
But in my case, what means contradiction,

916
00:49:48,930 --> 00:49:53,460
you find function which, if
you will use this function,

917
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:54,960
you're not keeping invariants.

918
00:49:57,150 --> 00:49:58,430
- [Lex] So really the process

919
00:49:58,430 --> 00:50:01,300
of discovering contradictions.

920
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:02,133
- Yeah.

921
00:50:04,070 --> 00:50:05,910
It is like in physics.

922
00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:09,810
Find situation where
you have contradiction

923
00:50:09,810 --> 00:50:11,963
for one of the property,

924
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:15,500
for one of the predicate,

925
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:18,990
then include this predicate
making invariants.

926
00:50:18,990 --> 00:50:20,470
And solve, again, this problem,

927
00:50:20,470 --> 00:50:22,120
now you don't have contradiction.

928
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:24,513
But it is not

929
00:50:27,857 --> 00:50:30,360
the best way probably, I don't know,

930
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,940
to looking for predicate.
- That's just one way.

931
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:34,340
Okay.
- That, no, no.

932
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:37,310
It is brute force way.
- The brute force way.

933
00:50:37,310 --> 00:50:38,150
What about

934
00:50:39,810 --> 00:50:44,693
the ideas of what, big
umbrella term of symbolic AI?

935
00:50:45,912 --> 00:50:48,510
In the '80s with Xper Systems,

936
00:50:48,510 --> 00:50:51,363
sort of logic, reasoning-based systems.

937
00:50:53,413 --> 00:50:55,713
Is there hope there to find some,

938
00:50:57,010 --> 00:51:00,490
through sort of, deductive reasoning,

939
00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:04,433
to find good predicates?

940
00:51:05,495 --> 00:51:06,995
- [Vladimir] I don't think so.

941
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,223
I think that just logic is not enough.

942
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:14,750
- Kind of a compelling notion, though.

943
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:17,620
That when smart people sit in a room

944
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:20,350
and reason through things,
it seems compelling.

945
00:51:20,350 --> 00:51:23,543
And making our machines do
the same is also compelling.

946
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:27,760
- Everything is very simple

947
00:51:29,661 --> 00:51:32,773
when you have infinite
number of predicate.

948
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:35,240
You can choose

949
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:38,590
the function you want.

950
00:51:38,590 --> 00:51:41,683
You have invariants and you
choose the function you want.

951
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:46,367
But you have to have

952
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:48,660
not too many

953
00:51:50,459 --> 00:51:53,453
invariants to solve the problem.

954
00:51:56,743 --> 00:51:59,940
And how from infinite number function

955
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:02,970
to select finite number

956
00:52:05,086 --> 00:52:08,483
and hopefully small finite
number of functions.

957
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:11,080
Which is good enough

958
00:52:13,535 --> 00:52:16,693
to extract some small set
of admissible functions.

959
00:52:17,910 --> 00:52:19,850
So they will be admissible, it's for sure,

960
00:52:19,850 --> 00:52:23,880
because every function just
decrease set of function

961
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,670
and leaving it admissible.

962
00:52:25,670 --> 00:52:27,720
But it will be small.

963
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:32,720
- But why do you think
logic-based systems can't help?

964
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:36,360
Intuition, not--
- Because you should

965
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:39,460
know reality, you should know life.

966
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:43,626
This guy like Propp, he knows something

967
00:52:43,626 --> 00:52:48,402
and he tried to put in
invariants his understanding.

968
00:52:48,402 --> 00:52:50,900
- So but that's the human, yeah, yeah.

969
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:53,190
But see, you're putting too much value

970
00:52:53,190 --> 00:52:57,910
into Vladimir Propp's knowing something.

971
00:52:57,910 --> 00:53:01,120
- No, it is--
- Am I being misunderstanding?

972
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:02,903
- What means you know life?

973
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:07,010
What it mean?
- You know common sense.

974
00:53:07,010 --> 00:53:09,313
- No, no, you know something.

975
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:13,430
Common sense, it is some rules.

976
00:53:13,430 --> 00:53:14,810
- You think so?

977
00:53:14,810 --> 00:53:17,190
Common sense is simply rules?

978
00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:21,943
Common sense is every, it's mortality,

979
00:53:23,237 --> 00:53:24,700
it's fear of death,

980
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:27,900
it's love, it's spirituality,

981
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:30,840
it's happiness and sadness.

982
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:34,420
All of it is tied up into
understanding gravity

983
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:37,102
which is what we think of as common sense.

984
00:53:37,102 --> 00:53:39,707
- I don't credit or discuss of that.

985
00:53:39,707 --> 00:53:44,707
I want to discuss understand
digit recognition.

986
00:53:45,190 --> 00:53:47,650
- Any time I bring up love and death

987
00:53:47,650 --> 00:53:50,650
you bring it back to digit recognition.

988
00:53:50,650 --> 00:53:52,300
I like it. (laughs)
- No, you know,

989
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:55,190
it is doable because there is a challenge.

990
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:57,720
- Yeah.
- Which I still have

991
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:01,590
to solve it; if I will
have a student concentrate

992
00:54:01,590 --> 00:54:04,800
on this work, I will
suggest something or so.

993
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,900
- You mean handwritten recognition?

994
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:09,480
Yeah, it's a beautifully simple, elegant,

995
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:11,383
and yet--
- I think that I know

996
00:54:11,383 --> 00:54:13,440
invariants which will solve this.

997
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:15,440
- You do?
- I think that, I think that.

998
00:54:17,205 --> 00:54:20,163
But it is not universal.

999
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:24,870
I want some universal
invariants which are good

1000
00:54:24,870 --> 00:54:29,360
not only for digit recognition,
for image understanding.

1001
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:34,210
- So let me ask, how hard do you think

1002
00:54:34,210 --> 00:54:37,133
is 2-D image understanding?

1003
00:54:38,810 --> 00:54:42,663
If we can kind of intuit
handwritten recognition,

1004
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:48,645
how big of a step, leap,
journey is it from that?

1005
00:54:48,645 --> 00:54:51,970
If I gave you good, if
I solved your challenge

1006
00:54:51,970 --> 00:54:54,830
for handwritten recognition,
how long would my journey

1007
00:54:54,830 --> 00:54:58,150
then be from that to
understanding more general,

1008
00:54:58,150 --> 00:54:59,990
natural images?
- Immediately.

1009
00:54:59,990 --> 00:55:04,990
You will understand it as soon
as you will make a record.

1010
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:07,750
- You think so?
- Because it is not for free.

1011
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:12,750
As soon as you will
create several invariants

1012
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:14,480
which will help you

1013
00:55:15,510 --> 00:55:17,770
to get the same

1014
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:22,830
performance that the best neural net did

1015
00:55:22,830 --> 00:55:27,790
using more than 100 times less examples.

1016
00:55:27,790 --> 00:55:31,260
You have to have something
smart to do that.

1017
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:33,992
- And you're saying?
- That's not an invariant.

1018
00:55:33,992 --> 00:55:37,457
It is predicate because
you should put some idea

1019
00:55:37,457 --> 00:55:38,573
how to do that.

1020
00:55:39,450 --> 00:55:40,363
- But okay.

1021
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:44,550
Let me just pause, maybe it's
a trivial point, maybe not,

1022
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:48,860
but handwritten recognition
feels like a 2-D,

1023
00:55:48,860 --> 00:55:50,483
two-dimensional problem.

1024
00:55:51,530 --> 00:55:54,420
And it seems, like how much complicated

1025
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:58,030
is the fact that most
images are a projection

1026
00:55:58,030 --> 00:56:03,030
of a three-dimensional
world onto a 2-D plane?

1027
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:05,920
It feels like for a
three-dimensional world,

1028
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:08,710
we need to start
understanding common sense

1029
00:56:08,710 --> 00:56:10,963
in order to understand an image.

1030
00:56:12,010 --> 00:56:17,010
It's no longer visual shape and symmetry.

1031
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:20,750
It's having to start to
understand concepts of,

1032
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:22,723
understand life.
- Yeah.

1033
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:27,350
You're talking that there
are different invariant,

1034
00:56:27,350 --> 00:56:28,950
different predicate, yeah.

1035
00:56:28,950 --> 00:56:32,520
- [Lex] And potentially
much larger number.

1036
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:36,800
- You know, maybe, but
let's start from simple.

1037
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,574
- [Lex] But you said that
it would be immediate.

1038
00:56:38,574 --> 00:56:41,440
- No, you know, I cannot
think about things

1039
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,163
which I don't understand yet.

1040
00:56:43,163 --> 00:56:44,810
This I understand.

1041
00:56:44,810 --> 00:56:48,460
But I'm sure that I don't
understand everything there.

1042
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:49,948
- [Lex] Yeah, that's the difference--

1043
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:50,980
- It's like they say,

1044
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:54,370
do as simple as possible, but not simpler,

1045
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:56,560
and that is exact case.

1046
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:58,980
- With handwritten rec--
- With handwritten.

1047
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:02,453
- Yeah, but that's the
difference between you and I.

1048
00:57:02,453 --> 00:57:06,184
(laughs) I welcome and enjoy

1049
00:57:06,184 --> 00:57:10,020
thinking about things that I
completely don't understand.

1050
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:12,410
Because to me it's a natural extension,

1051
00:57:12,410 --> 00:57:15,170
without having solved
handwritten recognition

1052
00:57:15,170 --> 00:57:17,733
to wonder how,

1053
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:24,340
how difficult is the next
step of understanding

1054
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:27,810
2-D and 3-D images, because ultimately,

1055
00:57:27,810 --> 00:57:30,260
while the science of
intelligence is fascinating,

1056
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:31,940
it's also fascinating to see how

1057
00:57:31,940 --> 00:57:34,730
that maps to the
engineering of intelligence.

1058
00:57:34,730 --> 00:57:39,330
And recognizing handwritten digits is not,

1059
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:42,640
doesn't help you, it might, it may not,

1060
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:46,570
help you with the problem
of general intelligence.

1061
00:57:46,570 --> 00:57:48,487
We don't know; it'll
help you a little bit.

1062
00:57:48,487 --> 00:57:49,510
We don't know how much.
- It is unclear.

1063
00:57:49,510 --> 00:57:50,690
- It's unclear.
- Yeah.

1064
00:57:50,690 --> 00:57:52,130
- It might very much.
- But I would like

1065
00:57:52,130 --> 00:57:55,140
to make a remark: I start not from very

1066
00:57:56,980 --> 00:57:59,140
primitive problem like,

1067
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:06,260
challenge problem; I start
with very general problem,

1068
00:58:06,330 --> 00:58:09,370
with Plato, so you understand.

1069
00:58:09,370 --> 00:58:13,612
And it comes from Plato,
digit recognition.

1070
00:58:13,612 --> 00:58:16,210
- So you basically took Plato

1071
00:58:17,723 --> 00:58:20,340
and the world of forms and ideas,

1072
00:58:20,340 --> 00:58:23,920
and mapped, and projected
it into the clearest,

1073
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:26,830
simplest formulation of that big world

1074
00:58:26,830 --> 00:58:27,870
into handwritten recognition.

1075
00:58:27,870 --> 00:58:30,880
- I will say that I did
not understand Plato until

1076
00:58:33,273 --> 00:58:36,181
recently, and until

1077
00:58:36,181 --> 00:58:40,800
I considered weak convergence
and then predicate

1078
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:43,630
and then, oh, this is what Plato thought.

1079
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:47,142
- Can you linger on that?

1080
00:58:47,142 --> 00:58:50,210
How do you think about this world of ideas

1081
00:58:50,210 --> 00:58:52,003
and world of things and Plato?

1082
00:58:53,063 --> 00:58:55,879
- It is a metaphor.
- It's a metaphor for sure.

1083
00:58:55,879 --> 00:58:58,295
It's a compelling, it's a
poetic and a beautiful metaphor.

1084
00:58:58,295 --> 00:59:01,672
But what can you--
- But it is a way how

1085
00:59:01,672 --> 00:59:04,960
you should try to understand

1086
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:07,890
how a duck ideas in the world.

1087
00:59:07,890 --> 00:59:09,403
So from my point of view,

1088
00:59:11,817 --> 00:59:15,560
it is very clear, but it
is a line all the time

1089
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:16,873
people looking for that.

1090
00:59:18,461 --> 00:59:22,460
Say, Plato then Hegel,

1091
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:24,310
whatever reasonable it exists,

1092
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:26,217
whatever exists it is reasonable.

1093
00:59:26,217 --> 00:59:29,173
I don't know what he
have in mind, reasonable.

1094
00:59:30,230 --> 00:59:31,800
- [Lex] Right, these philosophers again.

1095
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:33,400
- No, no, no, no, no, no, it is,

1096
00:59:34,336 --> 00:59:37,130
it is next stop of Wilner.

1097
00:59:37,130 --> 00:59:40,163
That which we might understand
something of reality.

1098
00:59:41,023 --> 00:59:43,090
He did the same Plato line.

1099
00:59:43,090 --> 00:59:46,463
And then it comes suddenly
to Vladimir Propp.

1100
00:59:48,628 --> 00:59:50,190
Look, 31 ideas, 31 units,
and describes everything.

1101
00:59:54,330 --> 00:59:59,087
- There's abstractions, ideas
that represent our world,

1102
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:03,310
and we should always
try to reach into that.

1103
01:00:03,310 --> 01:00:06,250
- Yeah, but what you
should make a projection

1104
01:00:06,250 --> 01:00:09,120
on the reality, but understanding is,

1105
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:10,723
it is abstract ideas.

1106
01:00:11,810 --> 01:00:15,950
You have in your mind
several abstract ideas

1107
01:00:15,950 --> 01:00:17,627
which you can apply to reality.

1108
01:00:17,627 --> 01:00:20,720
- And reality in this case so
if we look at machine learning

1109
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:22,700
is data.
- This example, data.

1110
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:24,060
- Data.

1111
01:00:24,060 --> 01:00:26,270
Okay, let me put this on you,

1112
01:00:26,270 --> 01:00:28,340
because I'm an emotional creature.

1113
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:30,800
I'm not a mathematical creature like you.

1114
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:35,221
I find compelling the
idea, forget the space,

1115
01:00:35,221 --> 01:00:36,810
this sea of functions.

1116
01:00:36,810 --> 01:00:39,560
There's also a sea of data in the world.

1117
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:42,320
And I find compelling that there might be,

1118
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:43,523
like you said, teacher,

1119
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:49,250
small examples of data
that are most useful

1120
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:54,020
for discovering good,
whether it's predicates

1121
01:00:54,020 --> 01:00:57,640
or good functions, that
the selection of data

1122
01:00:57,640 --> 01:01:02,170
may be a powerful journey,
a useful mechanism.

1123
01:01:02,170 --> 01:01:04,440
You know, coming up with
a mechanism for selecting

1124
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:06,503
good data might be useful, too.

1125
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:12,440
Do you find this idea of
finding the right data set

1126
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:14,020
interesting at all?

1127
01:01:14,020 --> 01:01:16,723
Or do you kinda take
the data set as a given?

1128
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:20,130
- I think that it is, you know,

1129
01:01:20,130 --> 01:01:22,670
my thing is very simple.

1130
01:01:22,670 --> 01:01:24,943
You have huge set of functions.

1131
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:30,703
If you will apply, and you
have not too many data.

1132
01:01:32,290 --> 01:01:36,600
If you pick up function
which describes this data,

1133
01:01:37,570 --> 01:01:39,963
you will do not very well.

1134
01:01:41,220 --> 01:01:44,140
- Like randomly pick?
- Yeah (mumbles)

1135
01:01:44,140 --> 01:01:45,443
It will be irritating.

1136
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:50,170
So you should decrease set of function

1137
01:01:50,170 --> 01:01:53,640
from which you're picking out one.

1138
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:58,063
So you should go somehow to
admissible set of functions.

1139
01:01:59,550 --> 01:02:02,770
And this, what about weak convergence?

1140
01:02:04,874 --> 01:02:08,060
From another point of view,

1141
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:09,480
to make

1142
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:14,530
admissible set of function,
you need just the deal,

1143
01:02:14,530 --> 01:02:18,983
just function which you
will take an inner product.

1144
01:02:20,177 --> 01:02:21,290
Which you will measure

1145
01:02:22,990 --> 01:02:24,563
property of your function.

1146
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:31,200
That is how it works.

1147
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:32,033
- [Lex] No, I get it, I get it.

1148
01:02:32,033 --> 01:02:34,060
I understand it but do you,

1149
01:02:34,060 --> 01:02:36,500
the reality is--
- But let's discuss,

1150
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:39,173
let's think about examples.

1151
01:02:40,030 --> 01:02:44,133
You have huge set of function
and you have several examples.

1152
01:02:45,508 --> 01:02:48,240
If you just trying to

1153
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:52,683
keep, take function which
satisfies these examples,

1154
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:55,273
you still will not have it.

1155
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:59,350
You need decrease, you need
admissible set of functions.

1156
01:02:59,350 --> 01:03:03,270
- Absolutely, but what, say you have

1157
01:03:03,270 --> 01:03:05,053
more data than functions.

1158
01:03:07,327 --> 01:03:09,800
I mean, maybe not more
data than functions,

1159
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:11,500
'cause that's--
- That's impossible.

1160
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:15,180
- Impossible, I was trying
to be poetic for a second.

1161
01:03:15,180 --> 01:03:17,300
I mean, you have a huge amount of data,

1162
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:19,033
a huge amount of examples.

1163
01:03:19,870 --> 01:03:22,090
- But amount of function can be

1164
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:24,721
even bigger.
- Even bigger, I understand.

1165
01:03:24,721 --> 01:03:25,554
- Everything is (chuckles)

1166
01:03:25,554 --> 01:03:27,543
- [Lex] There's always a bigger boat.

1167
01:03:27,543 --> 01:03:29,220
- Whole Hilbert Space of functions.

1168
01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:31,830
- I got you, but okay.

1169
01:03:31,830 --> 01:03:35,860
But you don't, you don't
find the world of data

1170
01:03:35,860 --> 01:03:38,750
to be an interesting optimization space?

1171
01:03:38,750 --> 01:03:42,113
Like, the optimization should
be in the space of functions.

1172
01:03:45,262 --> 01:03:46,940
- In creating admissible set of functions.

1173
01:03:46,940 --> 01:03:48,560
- [Lex] Admissible set of functions.

1174
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:52,233
- You know, even from the
classical, this is so.

1175
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:58,720
From structured reasoning,
you should organize

1176
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:03,063
function in the way

1177
01:04:04,410 --> 01:04:07,540
they will be useful for you.
- Right.

1178
01:04:07,540 --> 01:04:09,237
- And that is admissible step.

1179
01:04:10,197 --> 01:04:12,610
- But the way you're thinking about useful

1180
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:17,293
is you're given a small set of examples.

1181
01:04:17,293 --> 01:04:20,100
- Small set of functions which contain

1182
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:21,820
functions by looking for it.

1183
01:04:21,820 --> 01:04:26,430
- Yeah, but as looking for
it based on the empirical set

1184
01:04:26,430 --> 01:04:28,160
of small examples.
- Yeah.

1185
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:31,290
But that is another
story, I don't touch it.

1186
01:04:31,290 --> 01:04:35,730
Because I believe that
these small examples,

1187
01:04:35,730 --> 01:04:37,380
it's not too small.

1188
01:04:37,380 --> 01:04:41,360
Say 65%, law of large numbers works.

1189
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:43,400
I don't need uniform law.

1190
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:46,740
The story is that in
statistics there are two laws.

1191
01:04:46,740 --> 01:04:51,100
Law of large numbers and
uniform law of large numbers.

1192
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:56,100
So I want a situation where
I use law of large numbers

1193
01:04:56,170 --> 01:04:58,280
but not uniform law of large numbers.

1194
01:04:58,280 --> 01:05:00,380
- [Lex] Right, so 60 is law of large.

1195
01:05:00,380 --> 01:05:02,034
It's large enough.
- I hope, I hope.

1196
01:05:02,034 --> 01:05:05,206
It still needs some evaluation,

1197
01:05:05,206 --> 01:05:07,270
some balance, et cetera.

1198
01:05:08,122 --> 01:05:10,872
What I did is the following that,

1199
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:13,217
if you trust that

1200
01:05:16,469 --> 01:05:20,110
say, this average gives
you something close

1201
01:05:20,110 --> 01:05:24,031
to expectation so you can talk about that,

1202
01:05:24,031 --> 01:05:26,880
about this predicate.
- Yeah.

1203
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:30,327
- [Vladimir] And that is
basis of human intelligence.

1204
01:05:30,327 --> 01:05:33,770
- Good predicates, the
discovery of good predicates

1205
01:05:33,770 --> 01:05:34,860
is the basis of human intelligence.

1206
01:05:34,860 --> 01:05:36,200
- No, no, it is discovery

1207
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:39,218
of your understanding of world.

1208
01:05:39,218 --> 01:05:44,218
Of your total logic of
understanding the world.

1209
01:05:45,270 --> 01:05:47,765
Because you have several functions

1210
01:05:47,765 --> 01:05:51,145
which you will apply to reality.

1211
01:05:51,145 --> 01:05:52,794
- Can you say that again?

1212
01:05:52,794 --> 01:05:56,127
So you're--
- You have several functions,

1213
01:05:57,140 --> 01:05:59,890
predicates, but they're abstract.

1214
01:06:01,112 --> 01:06:04,350
Then you will apply them
to reality, to your data,

1215
01:06:04,350 --> 01:06:07,410
and you will create in
this weak predicate,

1216
01:06:07,410 --> 01:06:09,673
which is useful for your task.

1217
01:06:12,273 --> 01:06:16,170
But predicate are not related specifically

1218
01:06:16,170 --> 01:06:17,830
to your task, to this here task.

1219
01:06:17,830 --> 01:06:22,270
It is abstract functions,
which being applied,

1220
01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:24,500
applied to--
- Many tasks that you might

1221
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:26,688
be interested in.
- It might be many tasks.

1222
01:06:26,688 --> 01:06:27,917
I don't know.

1223
01:06:27,917 --> 01:06:29,940
Different tasks.

1224
01:06:29,940 --> 01:06:31,450
- [Lex] Well they should be many tasks.

1225
01:06:31,450 --> 01:06:32,850
Right?
- Yeah, I believe.

1226
01:06:34,066 --> 01:06:35,670
Like in Propp case.

1227
01:06:35,670 --> 01:06:40,170
It was for fairy tales, but
it's happened everywhere.

1228
01:06:40,170 --> 01:06:42,570
- Okay, we talked about
images a little bit but,

1229
01:06:43,550 --> 01:06:45,773
can we talk about Noam
Chomsky for a second?

1230
01:06:46,643 --> 01:06:48,893
(laughing)

1231
01:06:52,128 --> 01:06:54,240
- I don't know him very well.

1232
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:57,030
- Personally?
- Not personally I don't know.

1233
01:06:57,030 --> 01:06:58,230
- His ideas.
- His ideas.

1234
01:06:58,230 --> 01:07:01,030
- Well let me just say,
do you think language,

1235
01:07:01,030 --> 01:07:05,800
human language is essential
to expressing ideas,

1236
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:08,350
as Noam Chomsky believes?

1237
01:07:08,350 --> 01:07:10,934
So like, language is at the core

1238
01:07:10,934 --> 01:07:12,933
of our formation of predicates.

1239
01:07:14,100 --> 01:07:15,033
Human language.

1240
01:07:16,529 --> 01:07:20,750
- In all the story of
language is very complicated.

1241
01:07:20,750 --> 01:07:24,775
I don't understand this
and I thought about--

1242
01:07:24,775 --> 01:07:27,140
- Nobody does.
- I'm not ready

1243
01:07:27,140 --> 01:07:30,770
to work on that because it's so huge.

1244
01:07:30,770 --> 01:07:34,253
It is not for me, and I
believe not for our century.

1245
01:07:35,910 --> 01:07:39,870
- The 21st century.
- Not for 21st century.

1246
01:07:39,870 --> 01:07:42,180
We should learn something, a lot of stuff

1247
01:07:42,180 --> 01:07:45,100
from simple tasks like digit recognition.

1248
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:49,250
- So you think digital recognition,

1249
01:07:49,250 --> 01:07:53,660
2-D image, how would you more abstractly

1250
01:07:53,660 --> 01:07:56,490
define it, digit recognition?

1251
01:07:56,490 --> 01:07:58,263
It's 2-D image,

1252
01:07:59,530 --> 01:08:03,113
symbol recognition essentially?

1253
01:08:05,799 --> 01:08:09,730
I'm trying to get a sense,
sort of thinking about it now,

1254
01:08:09,730 --> 01:08:12,243
having worked with MNIST forever,

1255
01:08:13,174 --> 01:08:17,080
how small of a subset is
this of the general vision

1256
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:20,483
recognition problem and the
general intelligence problem?

1257
01:08:21,620 --> 01:08:22,453
Is it?

1258
01:08:24,075 --> 01:08:27,830
Is it a giant subset, is it not?

1259
01:08:27,830 --> 01:08:30,200
And how far away is language?

1260
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:33,143
- You know, let me refer to Einstein.

1261
01:08:34,580 --> 01:08:37,930
Take the simplest problem,
as simple as possible,

1262
01:08:37,930 --> 01:08:42,930
but not simpler, and this is
challenge, is simple problem.

1263
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:49,147
But it's simple by idea,
but not simple to get it.

1264
01:08:50,729 --> 01:08:52,562
When you will do this,

1265
01:08:53,786 --> 01:08:57,410
you will find some
predicate which helps it.

1266
01:08:57,410 --> 01:09:00,180
- Yeah, with Einstein you can,

1267
01:09:00,180 --> 01:09:03,057
you look at General Relativity,

1268
01:09:03,057 --> 01:09:06,783
but that doesn't help you
with quantum mechanics.

1269
01:09:06,783 --> 01:09:08,750
- And that's another story.

1270
01:09:08,750 --> 01:09:11,850
You don't have any universal instrument.

1271
01:09:11,850 --> 01:09:14,550
- Yeah, so I'm trying to wonder

1272
01:09:14,550 --> 01:09:16,663
if which space we're in.

1273
01:09:17,911 --> 01:09:21,110
Whether handwritten recognition
is like General Relativity

1274
01:09:21,110 --> 01:09:23,200
and then language is
like, quantum mechanics,

1275
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:26,970
are you still gonna
have to do a lot of mess

1276
01:09:26,970 --> 01:09:29,223
to universalize it but,

1277
01:09:31,940 --> 01:09:33,373
I'm trying to see.

1278
01:09:35,623 --> 01:09:39,150
What's your intuition why
handwritten recognition

1279
01:09:39,150 --> 01:09:40,913
is easier than language?

1280
01:09:42,020 --> 01:09:45,330
Just, I think a lot of
people would agree with that,

1281
01:09:45,330 --> 01:09:47,373
but if you could elucidate sort of,

1282
01:09:48,398 --> 01:09:50,213
the intuition of why.

1283
01:09:51,990 --> 01:09:53,900
- I don't know, no,

1284
01:09:53,900 --> 01:09:56,443
I don't think in this direction.

1285
01:09:56,443 --> 01:09:59,563
I just think in the direction
that this is problem,

1286
01:10:00,870 --> 01:10:02,250
which if you will

1287
01:10:03,950 --> 01:10:04,970
solve it well,

1288
01:10:08,252 --> 01:10:09,419
we will create

1289
01:10:12,550 --> 01:10:16,123
some abstract understanding of images.

1290
01:10:18,030 --> 01:10:19,710
Maybe not all images.

1291
01:10:19,710 --> 01:10:22,740
I would like talk to guys who doing

1292
01:10:22,740 --> 01:10:26,280
in real images in Columbia University.

1293
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:27,210
- What kind of images?

1294
01:10:27,210 --> 01:10:28,800
Unreal you said?

1295
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:29,820
- Real images.
- Real images.

1296
01:10:29,820 --> 01:10:32,310
- Yeah, what their idea is,

1297
01:10:32,310 --> 01:10:35,140
there are predicate what can be predicate.

1298
01:10:35,140 --> 01:10:40,140
I say symmetry will play a
role in real-life images.

1299
01:10:41,250 --> 01:10:43,900
In any real-life images, 2-D images,

1300
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:45,413
let's talk about 2-D images.

1301
01:10:46,330 --> 01:10:47,250
Because...

1302
01:10:50,250 --> 01:10:52,327
that's what we know.

1303
01:10:52,327 --> 01:10:55,930
And neural network was
created for 2-D images.

1304
01:10:55,930 --> 01:10:58,437
- So the people I know in
vision science, for example,

1305
01:10:58,437 --> 01:11:01,000
for people who study human vision,

1306
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:04,500
that they usually go
to the world of symbols

1307
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:06,970
and like, handwritten
recognition but not really.

1308
01:11:06,970 --> 01:11:08,470
It's other kinds of symbols

1309
01:11:08,470 --> 01:11:11,560
to study our visual perception system.

1310
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:15,170
As far as I know, not much
predicate-type of thinking

1311
01:11:15,170 --> 01:11:17,770
is understood about our vision system.

1312
01:11:17,770 --> 01:11:19,390
- [Vladimir] They did not
think in this direction.

1313
01:11:19,390 --> 01:11:21,730
- They don't, yeah, but
how do you even begin

1314
01:11:21,730 --> 01:11:23,080
to think in that direction?

1315
01:11:24,534 --> 01:11:26,603
- That is, I would like to discuss this.

1316
01:11:27,710 --> 01:11:31,910
Because if you'll be
able to show that it is

1317
01:11:32,810 --> 01:11:33,673
what's working,

1318
01:11:36,764 --> 01:11:40,360
and theoretical thing, it's not so bad.

1319
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:43,360
- So if we compare it to language,

1320
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:46,530
language has like letters,
a finite set of letters

1321
01:11:46,530 --> 01:11:49,480
and a finite set of ways
that you can put together

1322
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:53,720
those letters so it feels more
amenable to kind of analysis.

1323
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:58,690
With natural images,
there is so many pixels--

1324
01:11:58,690 --> 01:12:00,840
- No, no, no, letter,

1325
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:03,660
language is much, much more complicated.

1326
01:12:03,660 --> 01:12:08,030
It involves a lot of different stuff.

1327
01:12:08,030 --> 01:12:09,530
It's not just understanding of

1328
01:12:12,150 --> 01:12:13,893
simple class of tasks.

1329
01:12:15,260 --> 01:12:18,190
I would like to see list of task

1330
01:12:18,190 --> 01:12:20,240
where language is involved.
- Yes.

1331
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:23,210
So there's a lot of nice benchmarks now

1332
01:12:23,210 --> 01:12:26,483
in natural language processing,
from the very trivial,

1333
01:12:27,390 --> 01:12:30,190
like, understanding the
elements of a sentence,

1334
01:12:30,190 --> 01:12:33,050
to question/answering,
so much more complicated

1335
01:12:33,050 --> 01:12:36,120
where you talk about open domain dialogue.

1336
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:39,240
The natural question is,
will handwritten recognition,

1337
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:41,690
it's really the first step

1338
01:12:41,690 --> 01:12:44,610
of understanding visual information.

1339
01:12:44,610 --> 01:12:45,443
- Right.

1340
01:12:48,099 --> 01:12:51,070
But even our records

1341
01:12:51,070 --> 01:12:54,390
show that we're going wrong direction.

1342
01:12:54,390 --> 01:12:56,580
Because we need 60,000 digits.

1343
01:12:56,580 --> 01:12:59,330
- So even this first step, so forget about

1344
01:12:59,330 --> 01:13:01,080
talking about the full journey.

1345
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:03,450
This first step should be
taking in the right direction.

1346
01:13:03,450 --> 01:13:07,190
- No, no, in wrong direction
because 60,000 is unacceptable.

1347
01:13:07,190 --> 01:13:11,207
- No, I'm saying it should be
taken in the right direction

1348
01:13:11,207 --> 01:13:14,045
because 60,000 is not acceptable.

1349
01:13:14,045 --> 01:13:18,470
- You can talk, it's great
we have 1/2 percent of error.

1350
01:13:18,470 --> 01:13:21,620
- And hopefully the step from

1351
01:13:21,620 --> 01:13:24,543
doing hand recognition
using very few examples,

1352
01:13:24,543 --> 01:13:27,620
a step towards what
babies do when they crawl

1353
01:13:27,620 --> 01:13:29,524
and they understand their
physical environment.

1354
01:13:29,524 --> 01:13:30,940
- I don't know what baby do.
- I know you don't know

1355
01:13:30,940 --> 01:13:33,920
about babies, but--
- If you will do from very

1356
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:37,620
small examples, you will find principals

1357
01:13:38,755 --> 01:13:40,560
which are different.
- That will apply to babies.

1358
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:42,847
- From what we're using now.

1359
01:13:45,430 --> 01:13:48,340
Theoretical it's more or less clear.

1360
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:52,300
That means you will use weak convergence,

1361
01:13:52,300 --> 01:13:54,480
not just strong convergence.

1362
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:58,490
- Do you think these principals are,

1363
01:13:58,490 --> 01:14:00,703
will naturally be human interpretable?

1364
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:02,550
- [Vladimir] Oh yeah.

1365
01:14:02,550 --> 01:14:04,480
- So we'll be able to explain them

1366
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:06,230
and have a nice presentation to show

1367
01:14:06,230 --> 01:14:07,530
what those principals are?

1368
01:14:08,974 --> 01:14:10,780
Or are they very,

1369
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:14,420
going to be very kind of,
abstract kinds of functions?

1370
01:14:14,420 --> 01:14:16,863
- For example, I talk
yesterday about symmetry.

1371
01:14:18,710 --> 01:14:20,430
And I gave very simple examples.

1372
01:14:20,430 --> 01:14:22,010
The same will be like that.

1373
01:14:22,010 --> 01:14:24,680
- You gave like, a
predicate of a basic for--

1374
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:26,070
- For symmetries.
- Yes.

1375
01:14:26,070 --> 01:14:28,220
For different symmetries
and you have for--

1376
01:14:29,622 --> 01:14:30,455
- For degree of symmetries.

1377
01:14:30,455 --> 01:14:33,670
That is important, not just symmetry

1378
01:14:33,670 --> 01:14:36,143
exist and does not exist;
degree of symmetry.

1379
01:14:38,048 --> 01:14:40,233
- [Lex] Yeah, for handwritten recognition.

1380
01:14:41,590 --> 01:14:45,160
- It's not for handwritten,
it's for any images.

1381
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:47,700
But I would like to
apply it to handwritten.

1382
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:49,790
- Right, in theory it's more general.

1383
01:14:49,790 --> 01:14:50,923
Okay, okay.

1384
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:58,170
So a lot of the things
we've been talking about

1385
01:14:58,170 --> 01:15:01,840
falls, we've been talking
about philosophy a little bit,

1386
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:05,530
but also about mathematics and statistics.

1387
01:15:05,530 --> 01:15:08,120
A lot of it falls into this idea,

1388
01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:10,743
a universal idea of
statistical theory of learning.

1389
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:16,170
What is the most beautiful and sort of,

1390
01:15:16,170 --> 01:15:19,110
powerful or essential idea
that you've come across,

1391
01:15:19,110 --> 01:15:21,500
even for yourself just personally,

1392
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:25,490
in the world of statistics or
statistic theory of learning?

1393
01:15:25,490 --> 01:15:29,323
- Probably uniform convergence
which we do with (mumbles).

1394
01:15:32,990 --> 01:15:36,070
- [Lex] Can you describe
universal convergence?

1395
01:15:36,070 --> 01:15:39,023
- You have law of large numbers.

1396
01:15:40,070 --> 01:15:44,510
So for any function,
expectation of function,

1397
01:15:44,510 --> 01:15:48,130
average of function converged expectation.

1398
01:15:48,130 --> 01:15:50,510
But if you have a set of functions,

1399
01:15:50,510 --> 01:15:52,363
for any function it is true.

1400
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:55,816
But it should converge similar to anywhere

1401
01:15:55,816 --> 01:15:57,493
therefore all set of functions.

1402
01:16:01,060 --> 01:16:03,370
For learning, you need

1403
01:16:04,950 --> 01:16:08,563
uniform convergence; just
convergence is not enough.

1404
01:16:11,210 --> 01:16:15,693
Because when you pick up
one which gives minimum,

1405
01:16:17,875 --> 01:16:21,110
you can pick up one function

1406
01:16:21,110 --> 01:16:25,730
which does not converge and it
will give you the best answer

1407
01:16:26,730 --> 01:16:28,053
for this function.

1408
01:16:31,470 --> 01:16:35,168
So you need the uniform
convergence to guarantee learning.

1409
01:16:35,168 --> 01:16:37,390
Learning does not really enter
your law of large numbers,

1410
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:42,063
really universal.

1411
01:16:46,307 --> 01:16:49,467
The idea of universal
convergence exists in statistics

1412
01:16:49,467 --> 01:16:50,683
for a long time.

1413
01:16:55,490 --> 01:16:57,107
It is interesting that

1414
01:16:58,970 --> 01:17:02,130
as I think about myself,

1415
01:17:02,130 --> 01:17:05,360
how stupid I was for 50 years,

1416
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:06,910
I did not see weak convergence.

1417
01:17:08,455 --> 01:17:10,950
I work only on strong convergence.

1418
01:17:10,950 --> 01:17:14,260
But now I think that most
powerful is weak convergence

1419
01:17:15,260 --> 01:17:18,870
because it makes admissible
set of functions.

1420
01:17:18,870 --> 01:17:21,703
And even in old proverbs,

1421
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:27,720
when people tried to understand
recognition about duck law,

1422
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:30,460
looks like a duck and so on,

1423
01:17:30,460 --> 01:17:32,400
they used weak convergence.

1424
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:34,400
People in language they understand this.

1425
01:17:36,110 --> 01:17:40,030
But when we're trying to
create artificial intelligence

1426
01:17:42,260 --> 01:17:45,073
if we want invent in different way.

1427
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:50,550
Just consider strong convergence,
artificial intelligence.

1428
01:17:50,550 --> 01:17:52,740
- So reducing the set
of admissible functions

1429
01:17:52,740 --> 01:17:55,180
you think there should be

1430
01:17:56,930 --> 01:17:59,920
effort put into
understanding the properties

1431
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:01,943
of weak convergence?
- You know,

1432
01:18:02,890 --> 01:18:07,070
in classical mathematics,
in Hilbert Space,

1433
01:18:07,070 --> 01:18:12,070
there are only two forms of
convergence, strong and weak.

1434
01:18:14,170 --> 01:18:15,403
Now we can use both.

1435
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:19,263
That means that we did everything.

1436
01:18:21,912 --> 01:18:24,473
And it so happened,

1437
01:18:24,473 --> 01:18:29,473
that when we used Hilbert
Space, which is very rich space,

1438
01:18:30,010 --> 01:18:31,950
space of continuous functions

1439
01:18:34,870 --> 01:18:36,520
which has an integral and square.

1440
01:18:38,020 --> 01:18:42,400
So we can apply weak and
strong convergence for learning

1441
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:44,193
and have closed-form solution.

1442
01:18:45,130 --> 01:18:47,680
So for computation it is simple.

1443
01:18:47,680 --> 01:18:51,093
For me it is sign that it is right way.

1444
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:56,047
Because you don't need any this theory.

1445
01:18:56,047 --> 01:18:57,723
Yes, do whatever you want.

1446
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:02,297
But now the only way left

1447
01:19:02,297 --> 01:19:04,820
is the concept of what is predicate?

1448
01:19:04,820 --> 01:19:08,020
- Of predicate.
- But it is not statistics.

1449
01:19:08,020 --> 01:19:09,760
- By the way, I like
the fact that you think

1450
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:13,270
that heuristics are a mess
that should be removed

1451
01:19:13,270 --> 01:19:16,210
from the system, so closed-form solution

1452
01:19:16,210 --> 01:19:19,513
is the ultimate goal.
- No it so happens

1453
01:19:19,513 --> 01:19:20,810
that when you're using

1454
01:19:22,430 --> 01:19:25,223
right instrument, you
have closed-form solution.

1455
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:32,770
- Do you think intelligence,
human-level intelligence,

1456
01:19:32,770 --> 01:19:35,603
when we create it will,

1457
01:19:37,660 --> 01:19:41,383
will have something like
a closed-form solution?

1458
01:19:43,939 --> 01:19:46,390
- Now I'm looking on bounds,

1459
01:19:46,390 --> 01:19:49,353
which I gave bounds for convergence.

1460
01:19:50,907 --> 01:19:53,063
And when I'm looking for bounds,

1461
01:19:54,350 --> 01:19:55,183
I'm thinking,

1462
01:19:56,070 --> 01:20:00,973
what is the most appropriate
kernel of this bound would be.

1463
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:04,490
So we know that in say,

1464
01:20:06,281 --> 01:20:09,720
all our businesses we use
radial basis function.

1465
01:20:12,251 --> 01:20:14,290
But looking for the bound I think

1466
01:20:14,290 --> 01:20:17,540
that I start to understand
that maybe we need

1467
01:20:17,540 --> 01:20:21,140
to make corrections to
radial basis function,

1468
01:20:21,140 --> 01:20:22,650
to be closer

1469
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:28,430
to what's better for these bounds.

1470
01:20:28,430 --> 01:20:32,570
So I'm again trying to
understand what type of kernel

1471
01:20:34,140 --> 01:20:35,140
have best

1472
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:38,753
approximation, not an approximation,

1473
01:20:39,877 --> 01:20:43,470
best fit to these bounds.

1474
01:20:43,470 --> 01:20:45,610
- Sure, so there's a
lot of interesting work

1475
01:20:45,610 --> 01:20:47,870
that could be done in
discovering better function

1476
01:20:47,870 --> 01:20:49,774
than the radial basis functions

1477
01:20:49,774 --> 01:20:53,080
for the kinds of bounds you would find.

1478
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:55,890
- It still comes from,

1479
01:20:55,890 --> 01:20:59,393
you're looking to match
and trying to understand.

1480
01:21:00,270 --> 01:21:02,250
- From your own mind looking at the--

1481
01:21:02,250 --> 01:21:03,929
- Yeah but--
- I don't know.

1482
01:21:03,929 --> 01:21:05,479
- Then I'm trying to understand

1483
01:21:08,660 --> 01:21:11,260
what will be good for that.

1484
01:21:11,260 --> 01:21:14,010
- Yeah, but to me there's still a beauty,

1485
01:21:14,010 --> 01:21:17,990
again, maybe I'm descending
value toward heuristics.

1486
01:21:17,990 --> 01:21:22,343
To me, ultimately intelligence
will be a mess of heuristics.

1487
01:21:23,610 --> 01:21:25,930
And that's the engineering answer,

1488
01:21:25,930 --> 01:21:27,870
I guess.
- Absolutely.

1489
01:21:27,870 --> 01:21:30,703
When you're doing say, self-driving cars,

1490
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:34,153
the great guy who will do this.

1491
01:21:35,020 --> 01:21:38,633
It doesn't matter what theory behind that.

1492
01:21:40,620 --> 01:21:43,923
Who has a better theory have to apply.

1493
01:21:46,780 --> 01:21:50,400
It is the same story about predicate

1494
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:55,030
because you cannot create
rule for, situation is much

1495
01:21:55,030 --> 01:21:57,787
more than you have rule for that.

1496
01:22:01,220 --> 01:22:03,933
Maybe you can have more abstract rules,

1497
01:22:05,017 --> 01:22:07,763
then it will be less literal.

1498
01:22:08,780 --> 01:22:11,059
It is the same story about ideas

1499
01:22:11,059 --> 01:22:15,133
and ideas applied to specific cases.

1500
01:22:16,460 --> 01:22:18,920
- But still you should--
- You cannot avoid this.

1501
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:20,870
- [Lex] Yes of course,
but you should still reach

1502
01:22:20,870 --> 01:22:22,310
for the ideas to understand

1503
01:22:22,310 --> 01:22:23,980
the science.
- Yeah, yeah.

1504
01:22:23,980 --> 01:22:25,303
- Let me kind of ask,

1505
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:29,390
do you think neural networks or functions

1506
01:22:30,980 --> 01:22:32,653
can be made to reason?

1507
01:22:34,258 --> 01:22:37,140
What do you think, we've been
talking about intelligence,

1508
01:22:37,140 --> 01:22:39,660
but this idea of reasoning.

1509
01:22:39,660 --> 01:22:43,923
There's an element of
sequentially disassembling,

1510
01:22:45,498 --> 01:22:48,612
interpreting the images.

1511
01:22:48,612 --> 01:22:51,853
When you think of handwritten recognition,

1512
01:22:53,470 --> 01:22:55,270
we kind of think that
there will be a single,

1513
01:22:55,270 --> 01:22:58,653
there's an input and an output;
there's not a recurrence.

1514
01:23:00,060 --> 01:23:02,450
- Yeah.
- What do you think about,

1515
01:23:02,450 --> 01:23:04,430
sort of, the idea of recurrence?

1516
01:23:04,430 --> 01:23:06,670
Of going back to memory
and thinking through

1517
01:23:06,670 --> 01:23:08,763
this sort of, sequentially,

1518
01:23:10,570 --> 01:23:14,170
mangling the different
representations over and over

1519
01:23:14,170 --> 01:23:17,403
until you arrive at a conclusion?

1520
01:23:20,100 --> 01:23:22,010
Or is ultimately all of
that can be wrapped up

1521
01:23:22,010 --> 01:23:24,160
in a function? (chuckles)

1522
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:26,850
- You're suggesting,

1523
01:23:26,850 --> 01:23:29,840
that let us use this type of algorithm.

1524
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:33,090
When I started thinking, I first of all,

1525
01:23:33,090 --> 01:23:35,203
starting to understand what I want.

1526
01:23:36,570 --> 01:23:39,583
Can I write down what I want?

1527
01:23:41,568 --> 01:23:43,223
And then I try to formalize.

1528
01:23:44,687 --> 01:23:49,253
And when I do that, I'm thinking
how to solve this problem.

1529
01:23:57,630 --> 01:24:02,446
Till now I did not see situation where--

1530
01:24:02,446 --> 01:24:04,280
- Where you need recurrence.
- Recurrent.

1531
01:24:04,280 --> 01:24:07,850
- But do you observe human beings?

1532
01:24:07,850 --> 01:24:10,230
- Yeah.
- Do you try to,

1533
01:24:10,230 --> 01:24:12,400
it's the imitation question, right?

1534
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:14,900
It seems that human beings reason,

1535
01:24:14,900 --> 01:24:16,893
this kind of sequentially,

1536
01:24:18,576 --> 01:24:22,760
sort of, does that
inspire in you a thought

1537
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:25,550
that we need to add that into our

1538
01:24:27,690 --> 01:24:29,003
intelligence systems?

1539
01:24:30,770 --> 01:24:32,393
You're saying, okay,

1540
01:24:33,290 --> 01:24:34,430
you've kind of answered saying,

1541
01:24:34,430 --> 01:24:37,050
until now I haven't seen a need for it.

1542
01:24:37,050 --> 01:24:40,070
And so because of that,
you don't see a reason

1543
01:24:40,070 --> 01:24:41,750
to think about it?

1544
01:24:41,750 --> 01:24:44,983
- You know, most of
things I don't understand.

1545
01:24:45,870 --> 01:24:47,503
In reasoning, in humans,

1546
01:24:48,470 --> 01:24:50,543
it is for me too complicated.

1547
01:24:52,730 --> 01:24:57,530
For me, the most difficult part is

1548
01:24:59,110 --> 01:25:00,173
to ask questions,

1549
01:25:01,210 --> 01:25:03,080
good questions.

1550
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:06,833
How it works, how people asking questions.

1551
01:25:08,900 --> 01:25:09,800
I don't know this.

1552
01:25:11,720 --> 01:25:13,650
- You said that machine
learning's not only

1553
01:25:13,650 --> 01:25:16,490
about technical things,
speaking of questions,

1554
01:25:16,490 --> 01:25:18,193
but it's also about philosophy.

1555
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:23,460
What role does philosophy
play in machine learning?

1556
01:25:23,460 --> 01:25:26,860
We talked about Plato,
but generally thinking

1557
01:25:28,230 --> 01:25:29,927
in this philosophical way,

1558
01:25:32,015 --> 01:25:35,223
how does philosophy and math
fit together in your mind?

1559
01:25:37,387 --> 01:25:39,373
- Just ideas, and then
their implementation.

1560
01:25:39,373 --> 01:25:41,003
It's like predicate,

1561
01:25:45,205 --> 01:25:47,955
say, admissible set of functions.

1562
01:25:49,100 --> 01:25:51,500
It comes together, everything.

1563
01:25:51,500 --> 01:25:52,333
Because,

1564
01:25:54,530 --> 01:25:58,550
the first declaration of
theory was done 50 years ago,

1565
01:25:58,550 --> 01:26:02,250
all that necessary, so everything there.

1566
01:26:02,250 --> 01:26:04,707
If you have data you can, and you,

1567
01:26:06,143 --> 01:26:07,280
in your set of functions

1568
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,610
has not big capacity.

1569
01:26:13,610 --> 01:26:15,780
So law of inter-dimension,
you can do that.

1570
01:26:15,780 --> 01:26:19,693
You can make structuralist
minimization, control capacity.

1571
01:26:21,140 --> 01:26:21,973
But

1572
01:26:24,042 --> 01:26:29,042
there was not table to make
admissible set of function with.

1573
01:26:29,490 --> 01:26:31,930
Now when suddenly we realize that

1574
01:26:33,153 --> 01:26:37,347
we did not use another idea
of convergence, which we can,

1575
01:26:39,480 --> 01:26:41,500
everything comes together.

1576
01:26:41,500 --> 01:26:43,340
- But those are mathematical notions.

1577
01:26:43,340 --> 01:26:48,000
Philosophy plays a role of simply saying

1578
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:52,080
that we should be swimming
in the space of ideas.

1579
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:54,300
- Let's talk, what is philosophy?

1580
01:26:54,300 --> 01:26:56,963
Philosophy means understanding of life.

1581
01:26:59,070 --> 01:27:02,673
Understanding of life,
say people like Plato,

1582
01:27:03,871 --> 01:27:06,793
they understand on very
high, abstract level of life.

1583
01:27:09,245 --> 01:27:12,040
And whatever I'm doing,

1584
01:27:12,040 --> 01:27:15,683
it's just implementation of
my understanding of life.

1585
01:27:16,730 --> 01:27:18,480
But every new step,

1586
01:27:20,447 --> 01:27:21,597
that is very difficult.

1587
01:27:22,470 --> 01:27:23,573
For example,

1588
01:27:26,170 --> 01:27:29,740
to find this idea that we need

1589
01:27:31,903 --> 01:27:32,873
weak convergence,

1590
01:27:35,670 --> 01:27:36,503
was not simple

1591
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:38,753
for me.

1592
01:27:40,580 --> 01:27:43,180
- So that required thinking
about life a little bit.

1593
01:27:44,530 --> 01:27:48,833
Hard to trace, but there
was some thought process.

1594
01:27:49,790 --> 01:27:52,970
- You know, when I'm thinking
about the same problem

1595
01:27:52,970 --> 01:27:55,617
for 50 years now,

1596
01:27:57,160 --> 01:27:58,723
and again and again and again,

1597
01:28:00,030 --> 01:28:02,670
I'm trying to understand
that, this is very important,

1598
01:28:02,670 --> 01:28:04,333
not to be very enthusiastic.

1599
01:28:06,227 --> 01:28:09,824
But concentrate on whatever
that was not able to achieve.

1600
01:28:09,824 --> 01:28:11,241
- Patient.
- Yeah.

1601
01:28:12,404 --> 01:28:14,170
And understand why.

1602
01:28:14,170 --> 01:28:16,800
And now I understand that,

1603
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:21,680
because I believe in math, I believe that,

1604
01:28:21,680 --> 01:28:23,740
in this idea.

1605
01:28:23,740 --> 01:28:27,810
But now when I see that there are

1606
01:28:27,810 --> 01:28:32,073
only two ways of convergence,
and we're using loss.

1607
01:28:32,950 --> 01:28:37,950
That means that we must
as well as people do it.

1608
01:28:40,310 --> 01:28:44,310
But now, exactly in
philosophy and what we know

1609
01:28:44,310 --> 01:28:48,790
about predicate, how we
understand life can be described

1610
01:28:48,790 --> 01:28:50,133
as a predicate.

1611
01:28:51,420 --> 01:28:52,843
I thought about that.

1612
01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:59,033
And that is more or less
obvious level of symmetry.

1613
01:29:00,750 --> 01:29:02,903
But next,

1614
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:08,093
I have a feeling it's
something about structures.

1615
01:29:09,550 --> 01:29:11,393
But I don't know how to formulate,

1616
01:29:12,566 --> 01:29:14,493
how to measure and measure a
structure and all this stuff.

1617
01:29:17,430 --> 01:29:18,263
The guy who will

1618
01:29:19,283 --> 01:29:21,343
solve this challenge problem,

1619
01:29:22,220 --> 01:29:25,373
then when they will look at how he did it,

1620
01:29:27,270 --> 01:29:30,363
probably just only symmetry is not enough.

1621
01:29:31,890 --> 01:29:33,760
- [Lex] But something like
symmetry will be there.

1622
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:36,084
Structures of that kind.
- Oh yeah, absolutely.

1623
01:29:36,084 --> 01:29:37,540
Symmetry will be there.

1624
01:29:37,540 --> 01:29:39,273
A level of symmetry will be there.

1625
01:29:40,750 --> 01:29:42,870
And level of symmetry, anti-symmetry,

1626
01:29:42,870 --> 01:29:46,904
diagonal, vertical, I even don't know

1627
01:29:46,904 --> 01:29:49,700
how you can use in different direction

1628
01:29:49,700 --> 01:29:52,290
the degree of symmetry;
that's very general.

1629
01:29:52,290 --> 01:29:54,080
But it will be there.

1630
01:29:55,277 --> 01:29:56,830
I think that people are very sensitive

1631
01:29:56,830 --> 01:29:58,737
to the idea of symmetry.

1632
01:29:58,737 --> 01:30:02,893
But there are several ideas like symmetry.

1633
01:30:04,900 --> 01:30:07,010
As I would like to learn.

1634
01:30:07,010 --> 01:30:11,820
But you cannot learn
just thinking about that.

1635
01:30:11,820 --> 01:30:14,090
You should do challenging problems

1636
01:30:14,090 --> 01:30:15,523
and then analyze them.

1637
01:30:16,370 --> 01:30:19,493
Why it was able to solve them.

1638
01:30:20,439 --> 01:30:21,539
And then you will see.

1639
01:30:22,730 --> 01:30:25,423
Very simple things, it's not easy to find.

1640
01:30:26,281 --> 01:30:29,460
(Lex laughs)
Even talking about this,

1641
01:30:29,460 --> 01:30:32,890
every time.
- Yes.

1642
01:30:32,890 --> 01:30:36,320
- I was surprised, I tried to understand,

1643
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:39,070
these people describe in language

1644
01:30:40,120 --> 01:30:43,213
strong convergence mechanism for learning.

1645
01:30:44,450 --> 01:30:47,219
I did not see it, I don't know.

1646
01:30:47,219 --> 01:30:50,120
But weak convergence, the duck story

1647
01:30:50,120 --> 01:30:53,023
and story like that when you will explain,

1648
01:30:54,063 --> 01:30:57,620
you will use weak convergence argument.

1649
01:30:57,620 --> 01:31:00,930
It looks like a (mumbles)

1650
01:31:00,930 --> 01:31:04,410
but when you try to formalize,

1651
01:31:04,410 --> 01:31:05,820
you're just ignoring this.

1652
01:31:05,820 --> 01:31:07,683
Why? Why 50 years?

1653
01:31:08,680 --> 01:31:10,140
From start of machine learning.

1654
01:31:10,140 --> 01:31:11,910
- [Lex] And that's the role of philosophy,

1655
01:31:11,910 --> 01:31:14,210
thinking about life.
- I think that might be.

1656
01:31:15,175 --> 01:31:16,008
I don't know.

1657
01:31:18,300 --> 01:31:20,363
Maybe this is theory also,

1658
01:31:21,956 --> 01:31:25,810
we should blame for that because
empirical risk minimization

1659
01:31:25,810 --> 01:31:30,700
and now just starting, if
you read now textbooks,

1660
01:31:30,700 --> 01:31:34,410
they just about bound about
empirical risk minimization.

1661
01:31:34,410 --> 01:31:39,410
They don't look for another
problem like admissible set.

1662
01:31:41,420 --> 01:31:43,723
- But on the topic of life,

1663
01:31:45,070 --> 01:31:50,020
perhaps we, you, could talk
in Russian for a little bit.

1664
01:31:50,020 --> 01:31:53,160
What's your favorite
memory from childhood?

1665
01:31:53,160 --> 01:31:57,690
Okay, I want you to be
my (speaks in Russian)

1666
01:31:57,690 --> 01:31:58,523
- Music.

1667
01:31:59,410 --> 01:32:02,886
- How about, can you try
and answer in Russian?

1668
01:32:02,886 --> 01:32:06,053
(speaking in Russian)

1669
01:32:07,896 --> 01:32:09,563
What kind of musica?

1670
01:32:10,642 --> 01:32:13,809
(speaking in Russian)

1671
01:33:06,105 --> 01:33:09,272
(speaking in Russian)

1672
01:33:10,980 --> 01:33:12,983
Now that we're talking about Bach,

1673
01:33:14,130 --> 01:33:15,730
let's switch back to English,

1674
01:33:15,730 --> 01:33:17,733
'cause I like Beethoven and Chopin so.

1675
01:33:18,610 --> 01:33:20,870
- [Vladimir] Chopin is
another amusing story.

1676
01:33:20,870 --> 01:33:22,990
I was--
- But Bach, if we talk

1677
01:33:22,990 --> 01:33:25,350
about predicates, Bach probably

1678
01:33:26,760 --> 01:33:28,480
has the most

1679
01:33:28,480 --> 01:33:31,097
sort of, well defined
predicates that underlie it.

1680
01:33:31,097 --> 01:33:34,220
- You know, it is very interesting to read

1681
01:33:35,240 --> 01:33:38,740
what critics writing about Bach,

1682
01:33:38,740 --> 01:33:41,040
which words they're using, they're trying

1683
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:43,563
to describe predicates.
- Yeah.

1684
01:33:45,561 --> 01:33:47,880
- And then Chopin.

1685
01:33:47,880 --> 01:33:52,310
It is very different vocabulary.

1686
01:33:52,310 --> 01:33:55,160
Very different predicate.

1687
01:33:55,160 --> 01:33:56,433
And I think that,

1688
01:33:58,190 --> 01:34:00,493
if you will make collection of that.

1689
01:34:02,700 --> 01:34:05,570
So maybe from this you can describe

1690
01:34:05,570 --> 01:34:07,543
predicate for digit recognition.

1691
01:34:07,543 --> 01:34:10,450
- [Lex] From Bach and Chopin.

1692
01:34:10,450 --> 01:34:12,550
- No, no, no, not from Bach and Chopin.

1693
01:34:12,550 --> 01:34:14,140
- [Lex] From the the critic interpretation

1694
01:34:14,140 --> 01:34:17,070
of the music, yeah.
- They're trying to explain

1695
01:34:17,070 --> 01:34:18,720
you music, what they use this?

1696
01:34:23,020 --> 01:34:26,380
They describe high-level
ideas of Plato's ideas

1697
01:34:26,380 --> 01:34:29,703
behind this music.
- That's brilliant.

1698
01:34:31,090 --> 01:34:34,940
Art is not self-explanatory in some sense.

1699
01:34:34,940 --> 01:34:39,060
So you have to try to
convert it into ideas.

1700
01:34:39,060 --> 01:34:40,950
- It is insulate problems.

1701
01:34:40,950 --> 01:34:43,560
When you go from ideas to,

1702
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:46,080
to the representation.

1703
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:49,580
It is easy way, but when
you're trying to go back,

1704
01:34:49,580 --> 01:34:51,630
it is you will pose problems but,

1705
01:34:51,630 --> 01:34:56,630
nevertheless, I believe when
you're looking from that,

1706
01:34:56,910 --> 01:34:59,710
even from art, you will be able

1707
01:34:59,710 --> 01:35:02,543
to find predicate for digit recognition.

1708
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:08,500
- That's such a fascinating
and powerful notion.

1709
01:35:08,500 --> 01:35:10,623
Do you ponder your own mortality?

1710
01:35:11,670 --> 01:35:13,440
Do you think about it? Do you fear it?

1711
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:15,113
Do you draw insight from it?

1712
01:35:17,250 --> 01:35:18,750
- About mortality?

1713
01:35:19,860 --> 01:35:20,693
Oh yeah.

1714
01:35:21,550 --> 01:35:23,150
- [Lex] Are you afraid of death?

1715
01:35:25,860 --> 01:35:29,650
- Not too much, not too much.

1716
01:35:29,650 --> 01:35:32,800
It is pity that I will not be able

1717
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:34,820
to do something which I think

1718
01:35:36,853 --> 01:35:38,413
I was a feeling to do that.

1719
01:35:39,905 --> 01:35:42,967
For example, I will be very happy

1720
01:35:44,609 --> 01:35:48,412
to work with guys,

1721
01:35:48,412 --> 01:35:49,712
take tradition from music.

1722
01:35:50,700 --> 01:35:52,880
To write this collection of description,

1723
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:56,730
how they describe music,
how they use a predicate.

1724
01:35:56,730 --> 01:35:59,553
And from art as well.

1725
01:36:00,410 --> 01:36:02,393
Then take what's in common,

1726
01:36:03,470 --> 01:36:05,350
and try to understand predicate

1727
01:36:06,310 --> 01:36:08,994
which is absolute for everything.

1728
01:36:08,994 --> 01:36:10,490
- [Lex] For visual recognition

1729
01:36:10,490 --> 01:36:11,956
and see that there is a connection.

1730
01:36:11,956 --> 01:36:13,970
- Yeah, yeah, exactly.

1731
01:36:13,970 --> 01:36:16,326
- [Lex] There's still
time; we've got time.

1732
01:36:16,326 --> 01:36:18,916
(laughing)

1733
01:36:18,916 --> 01:36:20,166
We've got time.

1734
01:36:21,660 --> 01:36:24,052
- It takes years and years

1735
01:36:24,052 --> 01:36:24,885
and years.
- You think so?

1736
01:36:24,885 --> 01:36:26,910
- It's a long way.

1737
01:36:26,910 --> 01:36:30,930
- See, you've got the
patient mathematician's mind.

1738
01:36:30,930 --> 01:36:33,050
I think it could be done very quickly

1739
01:36:33,050 --> 01:36:34,100
and very beautifully.

1740
01:36:34,100 --> 01:36:35,850
I think it's a really elegant idea.

1741
01:36:36,990 --> 01:36:38,569
Some of many.
- Yeah, you know,

1742
01:36:38,569 --> 01:36:42,973
the most time it is not
to make this collection,

1743
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:46,300
to understand what is in common,

1744
01:36:46,300 --> 01:36:48,730
to think about that once again and again

1745
01:36:48,730 --> 01:36:50,600
and again.
- Again and again and again.

1746
01:36:50,600 --> 01:36:54,220
But I think sometimes,
especially when you just say

1747
01:36:54,220 --> 01:36:58,800
this idea now, even just
putting together the collection

1748
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:03,340
and looking at the different sets of data.

1749
01:37:03,340 --> 01:37:07,280
Language, trying to interpret
music, criticize music,

1750
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:10,010
and images, I think there will be sparks

1751
01:37:10,010 --> 01:37:11,000
of ideas that will come.

1752
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:12,670
Of course, again and again you'll come up

1753
01:37:12,670 --> 01:37:15,630
with better ideas but
even just that notion

1754
01:37:15,630 --> 01:37:19,373
is a beautiful notion.
- I even have some example.

1755
01:37:21,630 --> 01:37:23,033
So I have friend,

1756
01:37:25,210 --> 01:37:26,340
who was

1757
01:37:27,720 --> 01:37:29,873
specialized in Russian poetry.

1758
01:37:30,950 --> 01:37:34,643
She is professor of Russian poetry.

1759
01:37:35,582 --> 01:37:39,410
She did not write poems,

1760
01:37:39,410 --> 01:37:40,570
but she

1761
01:37:41,560 --> 01:37:43,493
know a lot of stuff.

1762
01:37:44,515 --> 01:37:45,348
She make

1763
01:37:47,184 --> 01:37:49,350
books, several books and one of them

1764
01:37:49,350 --> 01:37:53,073
is a collection of Russian poetry.

1765
01:37:54,690 --> 01:37:57,130
She has images of Russian poetry.

1766
01:37:57,130 --> 01:37:59,283
She collected all images
of Russian poetry.

1767
01:38:00,700 --> 01:38:03,253
And I asked her to do following.

1768
01:38:05,420 --> 01:38:08,773
You have Nip's digit recognition.

1769
01:38:09,720 --> 01:38:11,807
And we get 100 digits,

1770
01:38:14,456 --> 01:38:18,827
less than 100, I don't
remember, maybe 50 digits.

1771
01:38:18,827 --> 01:38:21,660
And try from practical point of view,

1772
01:38:21,660 --> 01:38:25,450
describe every image you see,

1773
01:38:25,450 --> 01:38:30,193
using only words of
images of Russian poetry.

1774
01:38:31,330 --> 01:38:32,223
And she did it.

1775
01:38:34,310 --> 01:38:37,603
And then we tried to,

1776
01:38:41,140 --> 01:38:44,003
I call it learning using
privileged information.

1777
01:38:44,003 --> 01:38:45,920
I call it privileged information.

1778
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:48,040
You have on two languages.

1779
01:38:48,040 --> 01:38:53,040
One language is just image of digit.

1780
01:38:53,130 --> 01:38:56,623
And another language by it
a description of this image.

1781
01:38:57,750 --> 01:39:00,193
And this is privileged information.

1782
01:39:02,587 --> 01:39:04,523
And there is an algorithm
when we are working

1783
01:39:04,523 --> 01:39:06,880
with privileged information,
you're doing well.

1784
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:08,673
Better, much better.

1785
01:39:08,673 --> 01:39:13,106
- So there's something there.
- Something there.

1786
01:39:13,106 --> 01:39:14,106
And there is

1787
01:39:15,443 --> 01:39:17,345
and the thing,

1788
01:39:17,345 --> 01:39:18,820
she unfortunately died.

1789
01:39:20,890 --> 01:39:24,830
The collection of digits

1790
01:39:24,830 --> 01:39:27,223
and poetic descriptions of those digits.

1791
01:39:29,378 --> 01:39:30,900
- [Lex] So there's something there

1792
01:39:30,900 --> 01:39:33,240
in that poetic description.

1793
01:39:33,240 --> 01:39:34,073
- I think that

1794
01:39:35,590 --> 01:39:39,700
there is an abstract ideas on the Plato

1795
01:39:39,700 --> 01:39:42,010
level of ideas.
- Yeah, that are there,

1796
01:39:42,010 --> 01:39:44,030
that could be discovered, and music seems

1797
01:39:44,030 --> 01:39:44,980
to be a good entry point.

1798
01:39:44,980 --> 01:39:47,343
- But as soon as we start this,

1799
01:39:48,420 --> 01:39:50,340
here's this challenge problem.

1800
01:39:50,340 --> 01:39:53,310
- The challenge problem--
- It immediately connected

1801
01:39:54,222 --> 01:39:55,410
to all this stuff.

1802
01:39:55,410 --> 01:39:58,400
- Especially with your
talk and this podcast,

1803
01:39:58,400 --> 01:40:00,090
I'll do whatever I can to advertise.

1804
01:40:00,090 --> 01:40:03,260
Such a clean, beautiful,
Einstein-like formulation

1805
01:40:03,260 --> 01:40:05,940
of the challenge before us.
- Right.

1806
01:40:05,940 --> 01:40:09,503
- Let me ask another absurd question.

1807
01:40:10,470 --> 01:40:14,020
We talked about mortality,
we talked about philosophy

1808
01:40:14,020 --> 01:40:16,520
of life; what do you think
is the meaning of life?

1809
01:40:17,560 --> 01:40:19,570
What's the predicate

1810
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:24,093
for mysterious existence here on Earth?

1811
01:40:29,865 --> 01:40:31,115
- I don't know.

1812
01:40:33,630 --> 01:40:35,733
It's very interesting how we have,

1813
01:40:37,640 --> 01:40:39,560
in Russia, I don't know if you know

1814
01:40:40,804 --> 01:40:41,930
the guy Strogatski?

1815
01:40:44,270 --> 01:40:47,860
They're writing futures
they're thinking about,

1816
01:40:47,860 --> 01:40:49,583
Hume, what's going on.

1817
01:40:51,966 --> 01:40:55,611
And they have an idea

1818
01:40:55,611 --> 01:40:59,130
that there are developing

1819
01:41:00,570 --> 01:41:05,090
two type of people: Common
people and very smart people.

1820
01:41:05,090 --> 01:41:05,990
They just started.

1821
01:41:07,270 --> 01:41:10,400
And these two branches of people will go

1822
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:12,173
in different directions very soon.

1823
01:41:13,550 --> 01:41:16,642
So that's what they're
thinking about next.

1824
01:41:16,642 --> 01:41:19,790
- (laughs) So the purpose of life

1825
01:41:19,790 --> 01:41:24,052
is to create two (chuckles) two paths.

1826
01:41:24,052 --> 01:41:25,950
- Two paths.
- As human societies.

1827
01:41:25,950 --> 01:41:28,050
Yeah.
- Yes, simple people

1828
01:41:28,050 --> 01:41:29,980
and more complicated people.

1829
01:41:29,980 --> 01:41:31,520
- Which do you like best?

1830
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:33,663
The simple people or the complicated ones?

1831
01:41:34,500 --> 01:41:35,913
- I don't know, Strogatski,

1832
01:41:37,135 --> 01:41:39,580
he's just, he's fantasy but you know,

1833
01:41:39,580 --> 01:41:43,880
every week we have guy who is just

1834
01:41:46,440 --> 01:41:50,823
writer, and also Soletskoff literature.

1835
01:41:51,850 --> 01:41:56,610
And he explained how he
understands literature

1836
01:41:56,610 --> 01:41:58,800
and human relationship.

1837
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:00,343
How he sees life.

1838
01:42:02,477 --> 01:42:07,477
And I understood that I'm just
small kid comparing to him.

1839
01:42:09,530 --> 01:42:12,550
He is very smart guy
in understanding life.

1840
01:42:14,114 --> 01:42:18,137
He knows this predicate, he
knows big blocks of life.

1841
01:42:20,255 --> 01:42:23,303
I'm amused every time I listen to him.

1842
01:42:24,730 --> 01:42:27,160
And he's just talking about literature.

1843
01:42:27,160 --> 01:42:31,383
And I think that I was surprised.

1844
01:42:33,200 --> 01:42:36,870
So the

1845
01:42:36,870 --> 01:42:39,943
managers in big companies,

1846
01:42:41,470 --> 01:42:43,230
most of them are

1847
01:42:44,630 --> 01:42:48,770
guys who study English language

1848
01:42:48,770 --> 01:42:50,013
and English literature.

1849
01:42:51,110 --> 01:42:52,510
So why?

1850
01:42:52,510 --> 01:42:54,173
Because they understand life.

1851
01:42:55,210 --> 01:42:57,030
They understand models.

1852
01:42:57,030 --> 01:43:01,897
And among them, maybe
many talented creatures,

1853
01:43:03,517 --> 01:43:06,010
which are just analyzing this.

1854
01:43:06,957 --> 01:43:10,520
And this is big science like Propp did.

1855
01:43:10,520 --> 01:43:12,393
This is his blocks.

1856
01:43:13,360 --> 01:43:14,673
Yes, very smart.

1857
01:43:17,490 --> 01:43:20,480
- It amazes me that you are and continue

1858
01:43:20,480 --> 01:43:23,140
to be humbled by the brilliance of others.

1859
01:43:23,140 --> 01:43:25,530
- I'm very modest about myself.

1860
01:43:25,530 --> 01:43:28,960
I see so smart guys around.

1861
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:31,740
- Well let me immodest for you.

1862
01:43:31,740 --> 01:43:34,540
You're one of the greatest
mathematicians/statisticians

1863
01:43:34,540 --> 01:43:36,980
of our time, it's truly an honor.

1864
01:43:36,980 --> 01:43:38,226
Thank you for talking.
- No, no, no, okay, okay.

1865
01:43:38,226 --> 01:43:41,822
- And let's talk.
- (laughs) It is not.

1866
01:43:41,822 --> 01:43:45,248
- Yeah, let's talk.
- I know my limits.

1867
01:43:45,248 --> 01:43:49,130
- [Lex] Let's talk again when
your challenge is taken on

1868
01:43:49,130 --> 01:43:51,951
and solved by a grad student.

1869
01:43:51,951 --> 01:43:54,320
- Let's talk again.
- Especially when--

1870
01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:56,220
- [Vladimir] I hope that this happens.

1871
01:43:57,230 --> 01:43:58,920
- Maybe music will be involved.

1872
01:43:58,920 --> 01:43:59,930
Vladimir, thank you so much.

1873
01:43:59,930 --> 01:44:02,620
It's been an honor.

from Vladimir Vapnik.

1887
01:44:35,215 --> 01:44:37,707
"When solving a problem of interest,

1888
01:44:37,707 --> 01:44:40,027
"do not solve a more general problem

1889
01:44:40,027 --> 01:44:42,527
"as an intermediate step."

1890
01:44:42,527 --> 01:44:44,390
