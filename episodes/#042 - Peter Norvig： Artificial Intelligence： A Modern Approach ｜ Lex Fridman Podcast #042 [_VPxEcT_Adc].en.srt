you changed
 

61
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,110
you changed
in relation to it from the first edition

62
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:57,120
in relation to it from the first edition
 

63
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,189
in relation to it from the first edition
to the second to the third and now

00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,510

fourth edition as you work on it yeah so

66
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:01,520
fourth edition as you work on it yeah so
 

67
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,630
fourth edition as you work on it yeah so
it's been a lot of years

68
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:02,640
it's been a lot of years
 

69
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,710
it's been a lot of years
a lot of changes one of the things

70
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:04,720
a lot of changes one of the things
 

71
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,990
a lot of changes one of the things
changing from the first

72
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:06,000
changing from the first
 

73
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,510
changing from the first
to maybe the second or third

74
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:09,520
to maybe the second or third
 

75
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,550
to maybe the second or third
was just the rise of uh computing power

76
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:12,560
was just the rise of uh computing power
 

77
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,870
was just the rise of uh computing power
right so i think in the in the first

78
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:14,880
right so i think in the in the first
 

79
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,910
right so i think in the in the first
edition

80
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:15,920
edition
 

81
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,630
edition
we said uh here's predicate logic

82
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:20,640
we said uh here's predicate logic
 

83
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,270
we said uh here's predicate logic
but uh that only goes so far because

84
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:23,280
but uh that only goes so far because
 

85
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,390
but uh that only goes so far because
pretty soon

86
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:24,400
pretty soon
 

87
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,429
pretty soon
you have millions of uh short little

88
00:01:27,429 --> 00:01:27,439
you have millions of uh short little
 

89
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,109
you have millions of uh short little
predicate expressions and they couldn't

90
00:01:29,109 --> 00:01:29,119
predicate expressions and they couldn't
 

91
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,030
predicate expressions and they couldn't
possibly fit in memory

92
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:31,040
possibly fit in memory
 

93
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,710
possibly fit in memory
uh so we're going to use first order

94
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:32,720
uh so we're going to use first order
 

95
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,670
uh so we're going to use first order
logic that's more concise

96
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:35,680
logic that's more concise
 

97
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,310
logic that's more concise
and then we quickly realized oh

98
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:38,320
and then we quickly realized oh
 

99
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,390
and then we quickly realized oh
predicate logic is pretty nice

100
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:40,400
predicate logic is pretty nice
 

101
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,630
predicate logic is pretty nice
because there are really fast sat

102
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:42,640
because there are really fast sat
 

103
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,149
because there are really fast sat
solvers and other things

104
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:44,159
solvers and other things
 

105
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,749
solvers and other things
and look there's only millions of

106
00:01:45,749 --> 00:01:45,759
and look there's only millions of
 

107
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,749
and look there's only millions of
expressions and that fits easily into

108
00:01:47,749 --> 00:01:47,759
expressions and that fits easily into
 

109
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,670
expressions and that fits easily into
memory or maybe even billions fit into

110
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:49,680
memory or maybe even billions fit into
 

111
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,109
memory or maybe even billions fit into
memory now

112
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:51,119
memory now
 

113
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,429
memory now
so that was a change of the type of

114
00:01:53,429 --> 00:01:53,439
so that was a change of the type of
 

115
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,550
so that was a change of the type of
technology we needed

116
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:54,560
technology we needed
 

117
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,870
technology we needed
just because the hardware expanded even

118
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:56,880
just because the hardware expanded even
 

119
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,149
just because the hardware expanded even
to the second edition

120
00:01:58,149 --> 00:01:58,159
to the second edition
 

121
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,990
to the second edition
resource constraints were loosened

122
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:00,000
resource constraints were loosened
 

123
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,270
resource constraints were loosened
significantly yeah

124
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:01,280
significantly yeah
 

125
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,990
significantly yeah
yeah and that was the early 2000s second

126
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:04,000
yeah and that was the early 2000s second
 

127
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,870
yeah and that was the early 2000s second
edition

128
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:04,880
edition
 

129
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,469
edition
right so 95 was the first and then 2000

130
00:02:08,469 --> 00:02:08,479
right so 95 was the first and then 2000
 

131
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,229
right so 95 was the first and then 2000
2001 or so and then moving on from there

132
00:02:12,229 --> 00:02:12,239
2001 or so and then moving on from there
 

133
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,790
2001 or so and then moving on from there
i think we're starting to see that again

134
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:14,800
i think we're starting to see that again
 

135
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,070
i think we're starting to see that again
with the

136
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:16,080
with the
 

137
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,910
with the
gpus and then more specific type of

138
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:19,920
gpus and then more specific type of
 

139
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,430
gpus and then more specific type of
machinery like the tpus and using custom

140
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:23,440
machinery like the tpus and using custom
 

141
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,350
machinery like the tpus and using custom
asics and so on

142
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:25,360
asics and so on
 

143
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,710
asics and so on
for deep learning so we're seeing

144
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:26,720
for deep learning so we're seeing
 

145
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,550
for deep learning so we're seeing
another advance in terms of the hardware

146
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:30,560
another advance in terms of the hardware
 

147
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,710
another advance in terms of the hardware
then i think another thing that we

148
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:32,720
then i think another thing that we
 

149
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,710
then i think another thing that we
especially notice this time around

150
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:34,720
especially notice this time around
 

151
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,350
especially notice this time around
is in all three of the first editions we

152
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:37,360
is in all three of the first editions we
 

153
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,390
is in all three of the first editions we
kind of said

154
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:38,400
kind of said
 

155
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,550
kind of said
well we're going to find ai as

156
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:40,560
well we're going to find ai as
 

157
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,030
well we're going to find ai as
maximizing expected utility

158
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:43,040
maximizing expected utility
 

159
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,509
maximizing expected utility
and you tell me your utility function

160
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:45,519
and you tell me your utility function
 

161
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,030
and you tell me your utility function
and now we've got

162
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:47,040
and now we've got
 

163
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,990
and now we've got
27 chapters worth of cool techniques for

164
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:50,000
27 chapters worth of cool techniques for
 

165
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,750
27 chapters worth of cool techniques for
how to optimize that

166
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:51,760
how to optimize that
 

167
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,670
how to optimize that
i think in this edition we're saying

168
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:53,680
i think in this edition we're saying
 

169
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,190
i think in this edition we're saying
more you know what

170
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:55,200
more you know what
 

171
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,430
more you know what
maybe that optimization part is the easy

172
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:57,440
maybe that optimization part is the easy
 

173
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,110
maybe that optimization part is the easy
part and the hard part

174
00:02:59,110 --> 00:02:59,120
part and the hard part
 

175
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,589
part and the hard part
is deciding what is my utility function

176
00:03:01,589 --> 00:03:01,599
is deciding what is my utility function
 

177
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,949
is deciding what is my utility function
what do i want

178
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:02,959
what do i want
 

179
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,270
what do i want
and if i'm a collection of agents or a

180
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:05,280
and if i'm a collection of agents or a
 

181
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,229
and if i'm a collection of agents or a
society

182
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:06,239
society
 

183
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,790
society
what do we want as a whole so you touch

184
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:08,800
what do we want as a whole so you touch
 

185
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,470
what do we want as a whole so you touch
that topic in this edition you get a

186
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:10,480
that topic in this edition you get a
 

187
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,910
that topic in this edition you get a
little bit more into utility

188
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:11,920
little bit more into utility
 

189
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,630
little bit more into utility
yeah that's really interesting on a

190
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:14,640
yeah that's really interesting on a
 

191
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,390
yeah that's really interesting on a
technical level we're almost pushing the

192
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:16,400
technical level we're almost pushing the
 

193
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,350
technical level we're almost pushing the
philosophical

194
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:17,360
philosophical
 

195
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,589
philosophical
i guess it is philosophical right so we

196
00:03:19,589 --> 00:03:19,599
i guess it is philosophical right so we
 

197
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,509
i guess it is philosophical right so we
we've always had a philosophy chapter

198
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:21,519
we've always had a philosophy chapter
 

199
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,430
we've always had a philosophy chapter
which which i was uh

200
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:23,440
which which i was uh
 

201
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,270
which which i was uh
glad to that we were supporting

202
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:27,280
glad to that we were supporting
 

203
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,630
glad to that we were supporting
and now it's less kind of the uh

204
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:30,640
and now it's less kind of the uh
 

205
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,270
and now it's less kind of the uh
you know chinese room type argument and

206
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:33,280
you know chinese room type argument and
 

207
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,630
you know chinese room type argument and
more of these

208
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:34,640
more of these
 

209
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,670
more of these
uh ethical and societal type issues so

210
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:37,680
uh ethical and societal type issues so
 

211
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,550
uh ethical and societal type issues so
we get into

212
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:38,560
we get into
 

213
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,910
we get into
uh the issues of fairness and bias

214
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:41,920
uh the issues of fairness and bias
 

215
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,830
uh the issues of fairness and bias
and uh and just the issue of aggregating

216
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:44,840
and uh and just the issue of aggregating
 

217
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,309
and uh and just the issue of aggregating
utilities so how

218
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:46,319
utilities so how
 

219
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,789
utilities so how
do you encode human values into a

220
00:03:48,789 --> 00:03:48,799
do you encode human values into a
 

221
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,270
do you encode human values into a
utility function is is this something

222
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:51,280
utility function is is this something
 

223
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,830
utility function is is this something
that you can do purely through data in a

224
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:53,840
that you can do purely through data in a
 

225
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,350
that you can do purely through data in a
learned way or is there

226
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:55,360
learned way or is there
 

227
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,429
learned way or is there
some systematic obviously there's no

228
00:03:57,429 --> 00:03:57,439
some systematic obviously there's no
 

229
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:58,390
some systematic obviously there's no
good answers yet

230
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:58,400
good answers yet
 

231
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,750
good answers yet
there's just uh beginnings to this uh to

232
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:01,760
there's just uh beginnings to this uh to
 

233
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,390
there's just uh beginnings to this uh to
even opening

234
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:02,400
even opening
 

235
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,710
even opening
doors so there is no one answer yes

236
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:04,720
doors so there is no one answer yes
 

237
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,869
doors so there is no one answer yes
there are techniques uh to try to

238
00:04:06,869 --> 00:04:06,879
there are techniques uh to try to
 

239
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,949
there are techniques uh to try to
learn that so we talk about inverse

240
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:08,959
learn that so we talk about inverse
 

241
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,390
learn that so we talk about inverse
reinforcement learning

242
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:10,400
reinforcement learning
 

243
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,110
reinforcement learning
right so reinforcement learning uh you

244
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:13,120
right so reinforcement learning uh you
 

245
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,350
right so reinforcement learning uh you
take some actions you get some rewards

246
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:15,360
take some actions you get some rewards
 

247
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,789
take some actions you get some rewards
and you figure out what actions you

248
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:16,799
and you figure out what actions you
 

249
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:17,830
and you figure out what actions you
should take

250
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:17,840
should take
 

251
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,310
should take
in inverse reinforcement learning you

252
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:20,320
in inverse reinforcement learning you
 

253
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,749
in inverse reinforcement learning you
observe somebody

254
00:04:21,749 --> 00:04:21,759
observe somebody
 

255
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,390
observe somebody
taking actions and you figure out uh

256
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:24,400
taking actions and you figure out uh
 

257
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,350
taking actions and you figure out uh
well

258
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:25,360
well
 

259
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,710
well
that this must be what they were trying

260
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:26,720
that this must be what they were trying
 

261
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,469
that this must be what they were trying
to do if they did this action it must be

262
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:28,479
to do if they did this action it must be
 

263
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,150
to do if they did this action it must be
because they want it

264
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:30,160
because they want it
 

265
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,550
because they want it
of course there's restrictions to that

266
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:32,560
of course there's restrictions to that
 

267
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,270
of course there's restrictions to that
right so

268
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:33,280
right so
 

269
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,270
right so
lots of people take actions that are

270
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:35,280
lots of people take actions that are
 

271
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,550
lots of people take actions that are
self-destructive

272
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:36,560
self-destructive
 

273
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,710
self-destructive
uh where they're they're suboptimal in

274
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:38,720
uh where they're they're suboptimal in
 

275
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,749
uh where they're they're suboptimal in
certain ways so you don't want to learn

276
00:04:39,749 --> 00:04:39,759
certain ways so you don't want to learn
 

277
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:40,310
certain ways so you don't want to learn
that

278
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:40,320
that
 

279
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,550
that
right you want to uh somehow learn the

280
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:42,560
right you want to uh somehow learn the
 

281
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,390
right you want to uh somehow learn the
uh the perfect actions

282
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:44,400
uh the perfect actions
 

283
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,070
uh the perfect actions
uh rather than the ones they actually

284
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:46,080
uh rather than the ones they actually
 

285
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,629
uh rather than the ones they actually
take so so that's a challenge

286
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:48,639
take so so that's a challenge
 

287
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,150
take so so that's a challenge
uh for that field then

288
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:52,160
uh for that field then
 

289
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,390
uh for that field then
another big part of it is just kind of

290
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:54,400
another big part of it is just kind of
 

291
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,670
another big part of it is just kind of
uh theoretical

292
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:55,680
uh theoretical
 

293
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,710
uh theoretical
of saying uh what can we accomplish and

294
00:04:58,710 --> 00:04:58,720
of saying uh what can we accomplish and
 

295
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,189
of saying uh what can we accomplish and
so you look at like this

296
00:05:01,189 --> 00:05:01,199
so you look at like this
 

297
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,950
so you look at like this
this work on the uh programs to

298
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:04,960
this work on the uh programs to
 

299
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,950
this work on the uh programs to
uh predict recidivism and decide uh

300
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:08,960
uh predict recidivism and decide uh
 

301
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,390
uh predict recidivism and decide uh
you know who should get parole or who

302
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:10,400
you know who should get parole or who
 

303
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,070
you know who should get parole or who
should get bail or whatever

304
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:12,080
should get bail or whatever
 

305
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,550
should get bail or whatever
uh and how are you gonna evaluate that

306
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:14,560
uh and how are you gonna evaluate that
 

307
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,110
uh and how are you gonna evaluate that
and

308
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:15,120
and
 

309
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,990
and
one of the big issues is fairness across

310
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:18,000
one of the big issues is fairness across
 

311
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,430
one of the big issues is fairness across
protected classes

312
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:19,440
protected classes
 

313
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,070
protected classes
protected classes being things like uh

314
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:22,080
protected classes being things like uh
 

315
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,550
protected classes being things like uh
sex and race and so on

316
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:24,560
sex and race and so on
 

317
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,830
sex and race and so on
and uh so two things you want is you

318
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:27,840
and uh so two things you want is you
 

319
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,310
and uh so two things you want is you
want to say well if i get a score of say

320
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:30,320
want to say well if i get a score of say
 

321
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,749
want to say well if i get a score of say
uh six out of ten then i want that to

322
00:05:33,749 --> 00:05:33,759
uh six out of ten then i want that to
 

323
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:34,870
uh six out of ten then i want that to
mean the same

324
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:34,880
mean the same
 

325
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,270
mean the same
whether no matter what race i'm on yes

326
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:37,280
whether no matter what race i'm on yes
 

327
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,710
whether no matter what race i'm on yes
right so i want to have a

328
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:38,720
right so i want to have a
 

329
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,990
right so i want to have a
60 percent chance of reoccurring

330
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:42,000
60 percent chance of reoccurring
 

331
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,550
60 percent chance of reoccurring
uh regardless uh and the makers of the

332
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:46,560
uh regardless uh and the makers of the
 

333
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,670
uh regardless uh and the makers of the
one of the makers of a commercial

334
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:47,680
one of the makers of a commercial
 

335
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,029
one of the makers of a commercial
program to do that says that's what

336
00:05:49,029 --> 00:05:49,039
program to do that says that's what
 

337
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,469
program to do that says that's what
we're trying to optimize and look

338
00:05:50,469 --> 00:05:50,479
we're trying to optimize and look
 

339
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,189
we're trying to optimize and look
we achieved that we've we've reached

340
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:53,199
we achieved that we've we've reached
 

341
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,790
we achieved that we've we've reached
that kind of

342
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:54,800
that kind of
 

343
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,590
that kind of
balance and then on the other side you

344
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:57,600
balance and then on the other side you
 

345
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,590
balance and then on the other side you
also want to say

346
00:05:59,590 --> 00:05:59,600
also want to say
 

347
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,390
also want to say
well if if it makes mistakes i want that

348
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:02,400
well if if it makes mistakes i want that
 

349
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,070
well if if it makes mistakes i want that
to affect

350
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:04,080
to affect
 

351
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,749
to affect
both sides of the protected class

352
00:06:05,749 --> 00:06:05,759
both sides of the protected class
 

353
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,110
both sides of the protected class
equally

354
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:07,120
equally
 

355
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,629
equally
and it turns out they don't do that

356
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:08,639
and it turns out they don't do that
 

357
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,390
and it turns out they don't do that
right so they're

358
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:10,400
right so they're
 

359
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,670
right so they're
they're twice as likely to make a

360
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:11,680
they're twice as likely to make a
 

361
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,830
they're twice as likely to make a
mistake that would harm a black person

362
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:13,840
mistake that would harm a black person
 

363
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,309
mistake that would harm a black person
over a white person so that seems unfair

364
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:16,319
over a white person so that seems unfair
 

365
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,590
over a white person so that seems unfair
so you'd like to say well i want to

366
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:17,600
so you'd like to say well i want to
 

367
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,430
so you'd like to say well i want to
achieve both those goals

368
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:19,440
achieve both those goals
 

369
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,550
achieve both those goals
and then it turns out you do the

370
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:20,560
and then it turns out you do the
 

371
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,150
and then it turns out you do the
analysis and it's theoretically

372
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:22,160
analysis and it's theoretically
 

373
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:22,790
analysis and it's theoretically
impossible

374
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:22,800
impossible
 

375
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,550
impossible
to achieve both those goals so you have

376
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:24,560
to achieve both those goals so you have
 

377
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,029
to achieve both those goals so you have
to trade them off one against the other

378
00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:27,039
to trade them off one against the other
 

379
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,189
to trade them off one against the other
so that analysis is really helpful to

380
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:29,199
so that analysis is really helpful to
 

381
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:30,230
so that analysis is really helpful to
know

382
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:30,240
know
 

383
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,749
know
what you can aim for and how much you

384
00:06:31,749 --> 00:06:31,759
what you can aim for and how much you
 

385
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,749
what you can aim for and how much you
can get that you can't have everything

386
00:06:33,749 --> 00:06:33,759
can get that you can't have everything
 

387
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,189
can get that you can't have everything
but the analysis certainly can't tell

388
00:06:35,189 --> 00:06:35,199
but the analysis certainly can't tell
 

389
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,790
but the analysis certainly can't tell
you where should we make that

390
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:36,800
you where should we make that
 

391
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,830
you where should we make that
trade-off point but nevertheless then we

392
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:39,840
trade-off point but nevertheless then we
 

393
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,150
trade-off point but nevertheless then we
can

394
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:40,160
can
 

395
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,309
can
uh as humans deliberate where that

396
00:06:42,309 --> 00:06:42,319
uh as humans deliberate where that
 

397
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,749
uh as humans deliberate where that
trade-off should be yeah so at least we

398
00:06:43,749 --> 00:06:43,759
trade-off should be yeah so at least we
 

399
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:44,309
trade-off should be yeah so at least we
now we're

400
00:06:44,309 --> 00:06:44,319
now we're
 

401
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,070
now we're
we're arguing an informed way we're not

402
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:46,080
we're arguing an informed way we're not
 

403
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,070
we're arguing an informed way we're not
asking for something impossible

404
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:48,080
asking for something impossible
 

405
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,230
asking for something impossible
we're saying uh here's where we are and

406
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:50,240
we're saying uh here's where we are and
 

407
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,710
we're saying uh here's where we are and
and here's what we aim for and

408
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:52,720
and here's what we aim for and
 

409
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,950
and here's what we aim for and
this strategy is better than that

410
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:54,960
this strategy is better than that
 

411
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,749
this strategy is better than that
strategy

412
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:55,759
strategy
 

413
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,390
strategy
so that's i would argue is a really

414
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:58,400
so that's i would argue is a really
 

415
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,390
so that's i would argue is a really
powerful and really important first step

416
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:00,400
powerful and really important first step
 

417
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,189
powerful and really important first step
but it's a doable one sort of removing

418
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:03,199
but it's a doable one sort of removing
 

419
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:03,589
but it's a doable one sort of removing
uh

420
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:03,599
uh
 

421
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,550
uh
undesirable degrees of bias in uh in

422
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:06,560
undesirable degrees of bias in uh in
 

423
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,510
undesirable degrees of bias in uh in
systems

424
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:07,520
systems
 

425
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,029
systems
in terms of protected classes and then

426
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:09,039
in terms of protected classes and then
 

427
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,710
in terms of protected classes and then
there's something i listen to your uh

428
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:10,720
there's something i listen to your uh
 

429
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,390
there's something i listen to your uh
commencement speech

430
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:12,400
commencement speech
 

431
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,510
commencement speech
or there's some fuzzier things like you

432
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:15,520
or there's some fuzzier things like you
 

433
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,110
or there's some fuzzier things like you
mentioned angry birds yeah

434
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:17,120
mentioned angry birds yeah
 

435
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,469
mentioned angry birds yeah
do you want do you want to create

436
00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:18,479
do you want do you want to create
 

437
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,230
do you want do you want to create
systems that

438
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:20,240
systems that
 

439
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,230
systems that
feed the dopamine enjoyment that feed

440
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:24,240
feed the dopamine enjoyment that feed
 

441
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,990
feed the dopamine enjoyment that feed
that optimize for you returning to the

442
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:26,000
that optimize for you returning to the
 

443
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,350
that optimize for you returning to the
system enjoying

444
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:27,360
system enjoying
 

445
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,510
system enjoying
the moment of playing the game of

00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:29,520
the moment of playing the game of
 

447
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,110
the moment of playing the game of
getting likes or whatever

448
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:31,120
getting likes or whatever
 

449
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,710
getting likes or whatever
this kind of thing or some kind of

450
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:32,720
this kind of thing or some kind of
 

451
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,710
this kind of thing or some kind of
long-term improvement

452
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:34,720
long-term improvement
 

453
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,230
long-term improvement
right is if are you even thinking about

454
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:38,240
right is if are you even thinking about
 

455
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,510
right is if are you even thinking about
that

456
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:39,520
that
 

457
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,990
that
that's ex that's really going to the

458
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:42,000
that's ex that's really going to the
 

459
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,670
that's ex that's really going to the
philosophical area

460
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:43,680
philosophical area
 

461
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,350
philosophical area
i think that's a really important issue

462
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:45,360
i think that's a really important issue
 

463
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,950
i think that's a really important issue
too certainly thinking about that i i

464
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:46,960
too certainly thinking about that i i
 

465
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,150
too certainly thinking about that i i
don't think about that

466
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:48,160
don't think about that
 

467
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,150
don't think about that
as a as an ai issue as much

468
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:52,160
as a as an ai issue as much
 

469
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,029
as a as an ai issue as much
but as you say you know the point is

470
00:07:55,029 --> 00:07:55,039
but as you say you know the point is
 

471
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,230
but as you say you know the point is
we've

472
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:56,240
we've
 

473
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,710
we've
built this society in this

474
00:07:58,710 --> 00:07:58,720
built this society in this
 

475
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,869
built this society in this
infrastructure

476
00:08:00,869 --> 00:08:00,879
infrastructure
 

477
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,270
infrastructure
where we say we have a marketplace for

478
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:03,280
where we say we have a marketplace for
 

479
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,469
where we say we have a marketplace for
attention

480
00:08:04,469 --> 00:08:04,479
attention
 

481
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:08,150
attention
and uh we've decided as a society that

482
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:08,160
and uh we've decided as a society that
 

483
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,150
and uh we've decided as a society that
we like things that are free

484
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:10,160
we like things that are free
 

485
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,469
we like things that are free
and so we want all uh apps on our phone

486
00:08:12,469 --> 00:08:12,479
and so we want all uh apps on our phone
 

487
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:13,670
and so we want all uh apps on our phone
to be free

488
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:13,680
to be free
 

489
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,270
to be free
uh and that means they're all competing

490
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:15,280
uh and that means they're all competing
 

491
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,110
uh and that means they're all competing
for your attention and then eventually

492
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:17,120
for your attention and then eventually
 

493
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,510
for your attention and then eventually
they

494
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:17,520
they
 

495
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,749
they
they make some money some way through uh

496
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:19,759
they make some money some way through uh
 

497
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,189
they make some money some way through uh
ads or in-game sales or whatever

498
00:08:23,189 --> 00:08:23,199
ads or in-game sales or whatever

571
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,790
science fields
you know it's a dif it's a it's a huge

you know it's a dif it's a it's a huge

undertaking so
 

575
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,870
undertaking so
it must have been quite daunting what

00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:40,880
it must have been quite daunting what
 

577
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,790
it must have been quite daunting what
was that process like did you envision

578
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:42,800
was that process like did you envision
 

579
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,150
was that process like did you envision
that you would be

580
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:44,160
that you would be
 

581
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,190
that you would be
trying to cover the entire field

trying to cover the entire field

trying to cover the entire field
was there a systematic approach to it

584
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:48,720
was there a systematic approach to it
 

585
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,710
was there a systematic approach to it
that was more step by step

586
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:50,720
that was more step by step
 

587
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,509
that was more step by step
how did it feel so i guess it came about

588
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:53,519
how did it feel so i guess it came about
 

589
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:54,310
how did it feel so i guess it came about
you know

590
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:54,320
you know
 

591
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,710
you know
go to lunch with the other ai faculty at

00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:56,720
go to lunch with the other ai faculty at

and we'd say uh you know the field is

596
00:09:59,670 --> 00:09:59,680
and we'd say uh you know the field is
 

597
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,710
and we'd say uh you know the field is
changing

598
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:00,720
changing
 

599
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,230
changing
seems like the current books are a

600
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:02,240
seems like the current books are a
 

601
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,310
seems like the current books are a
little bit behind nobody's come out with

602
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:04,320
little bit behind nobody's come out with
 

603
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,710
little bit behind nobody's come out with
a new book recently we should do that

604
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:06,720
a new book recently we should do that
 

605
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,910
a new book recently we should do that
and everybody said yeah yeah that's a

606
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:07,920
and everybody said yeah yeah that's a
 

607
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,509
and everybody said yeah yeah that's a
great thing to do and we never did

608
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:09,519
great thing to do and we never did
 

609
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:10,069
great thing to do and we never did
anything

610
00:10:10,069 --> 00:10:10,079
anything
 

611
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,110
anything
right and then i ended up heading off

612
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:13,120
right and then i ended up heading off
 

613
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,990
right and then i ended up heading off
to uh industry i went to uh sun labs so

614
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,000
to uh industry i went to uh sun labs so
 

615
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,509
to uh industry i went to uh sun labs so
i thought well that's the end of

616
00:10:17,509 --> 00:10:17,519
i thought well that's the end of
 

617
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,590
i thought well that's the end of
my possible academic publishing career

618
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:21,600
my possible academic publishing career
 

619
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,430
my possible academic publishing career
but i met stuart again at a conference

620
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:23,440
but i met stuart again at a conference
 

621
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,110
but i met stuart again at a conference
like a year later

622
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:25,120
like a year later
 

623
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,470
like a year later
and said you know that book we were

624
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:26,480
and said you know that book we were
 

625
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,710
and said you know that book we were
always talking about you guys must be

626
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:28,720
always talking about you guys must be
 

627
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,069
always talking about you guys must be
half done with it by now right

628
00:10:32,069 --> 00:10:32,079
half done with it by now right
 

629
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:33,670
half done with it by now right
he said well we keep talking we never do

630
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:33,680
he said well we keep talking we never do
 

631
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,269
he said well we keep talking we never do
anything so i said well you know we

632
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:35,279
anything so i said well you know we
 

633
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,069
anything so i said well you know we
should do it

634
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:36,079
should do it
 

635
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,350
should do it
and i think the reason is that

636
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:39,360
and i think the reason is that
 

637
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,230
and i think the reason is that
we all felt it was a time where the

638
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:42,240
we all felt it was a time where the
 

639
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,550
we all felt it was a time where the
field was changing

640
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:44,560
field was changing
 

641
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,829
field was changing
and that was in two ways

642
00:10:47,829 --> 00:10:47,839
and that was in two ways
 

643
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,230
and that was in two ways
so you know the good old-fashioned ai

644
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:50,240
so you know the good old-fashioned ai
 

645
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,110
so you know the good old-fashioned ai
was based

646
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:51,120
was based
 

647
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,670
was based
uh primarily on boolean logic you had a

648
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:53,680
uh primarily on boolean logic you had a
 

649
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,230
uh primarily on boolean logic you had a
few

650
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:54,240
few
 

651
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,110
few
tricks to deal with uncertainty and it

652
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:57,120
tricks to deal with uncertainty and it
 

653
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:57,990
tricks to deal with uncertainty and it
was based

654
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:58,000
was based
 

655
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,230
was based
primarily on knowledge engineering then

656
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:00,240
primarily on knowledge engineering then
 

657
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,509
primarily on knowledge engineering then
the way you got something done is you

658

the way you got something done is you
 

659
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:02,949
the way you got something done is you
went out you interviewed an expert and

660
00:11:02,949 --> 00:11:02,959
went out you interviewed an expert and
 

661
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,550
went out you interviewed an expert and
you wrote down by hand

662
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:04,560
you wrote down by hand
 

663
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,670
you wrote down by hand
everything they knew and we saw in

664
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:07,680
everything they knew and we saw in
 

665
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,710
everything they knew and we saw in
in 95 that the field was changing in

666
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:10,720
in 95 that the field was changing in
 

667
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,190
in 95 that the field was changing in
in two ways one we're moving more

668
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:13,200
in two ways one we're moving more
 

669
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,710
in two ways one we're moving more
towards probability

670
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:14,720
towards probability
 

671
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,470
towards probability
rather than boolean logic and we're

672
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:16,480
rather than boolean logic and we're
 

673
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,630
rather than boolean logic and we're
moving more towards machine learning

674
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:18,640
moving more towards machine learning
 

675
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,350
moving more towards machine learning
rather than knowledge engineering uh and

676
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:21,360
rather than knowledge engineering uh and
 

677
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,870
rather than knowledge engineering uh and
the other books uh

678
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:22,880
the other books uh
 

679
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,389
the other books uh
hadn't caught that way if they were

680
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:24,399
hadn't caught that way if they were
 

681
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:25,910
hadn't caught that way if they were
still in the uh

682
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:25,920
still in the uh
 

683
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,829
still in the uh
more in the in the old school although

684
00:11:27,829 --> 00:11:27,839
more in the in the old school although
 

685
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:29,750
more in the in the old school although
so certainly they had part of that

686
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:29,760
so certainly they had part of that
 

687
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,750
so certainly they had part of that
on the way but we said if we start now

688
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:33,760
on the way but we said if we start now
 

689
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,829
on the way but we said if we start now
completely taking that point of view we

690
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:35,839
completely taking that point of view we
 

691
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,509
completely taking that point of view we
can have a different kind of book

692
00:11:37,509 --> 00:11:37,519
can have a different kind of book
 

693
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,710
can have a different kind of book
and we were able to put that together

694
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:40,720
and we were able to put that together
 

695
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,750
and we were able to put that together
and uh what was literally the process if

696
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:43,760
and uh what was literally the process if
 

697
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,190
and uh what was literally the process if
you remember

698
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:45,200
you remember
 

699
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,110
you remember
did you start writing a chapter did you

700
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:47,120
did you start writing a chapter did you
 

701
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,550
did you start writing a chapter did you
outline

702
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:48,560
outline
 

703
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,550
outline
yeah i guess i guess we did an outline

704
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:50,560
yeah i guess i guess we did an outline
 

705
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,790
yeah i guess i guess we did an outline
and then we sort of assigned

706
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:52,800
and then we sort of assigned
 

707
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,949
and then we sort of assigned
chapters to each person at the time uh

708
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:56,959
chapters to each person at the time uh
 

709
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,269
chapters to each person at the time uh
i had moved to boston and stewart was in

710
00:11:59,269 --> 00:11:59,279
i had moved to boston and stewart was in
 

711
00:11:59,279 --> 00:11:59,990
i had moved to boston and stewart was in
berkeley

712
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:00,000
berkeley
 

713
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,030
berkeley
so basically uh we did it uh

714
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:03,040
so basically uh we did it uh
 

715
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,590
so basically uh we did it uh
uh over the internet and uh you know

716
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:05,600
uh over the internet and uh you know
 

717
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,790
uh over the internet and uh you know
that wasn't the same

718
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:06,800
that wasn't the same
 

719
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,389
that wasn't the same
as doing it today it meant you know

720
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:10,399
as doing it today it meant you know
 

721
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,870
as doing it today it meant you know
dial-up lines and telnetting in and

722
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:14,880
dial-up lines and telnetting in and
 

723
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,389
dial-up lines and telnetting in and
you know you you telnetted into

724
00:12:18,389 --> 00:12:18,399
you know you you telnetted into
 

725
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,030
you know you you telnetted into
one shell and you type cat file name and

726
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:21,040
one shell and you type cat file name and
 

727
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,629
one shell and you type cat file name and
you hoped it was captured at the other

728
00:12:22,629 --> 00:12:22,639
you hoped it was captured at the other
 

729
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:23,990
you hoped it was captured at the other
end and

730
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:24,000
end and
 

731
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,990
end and
certainly you're not sending uh images

732
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:26,000
certainly you're not sending uh images
 

733
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,190
certainly you're not sending uh images
and figures back and forth

734
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:27,200
and figures back and forth
 

735
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,310
and figures back and forth
right right that didn't work but you

736
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:30,320
right right that didn't work but you
 

737
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,230
right right that didn't work but you
know did you anticipate where the field

738
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:32,240
know did you anticipate where the field
 

739
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,150
know did you anticipate where the field
would go

740
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:34,160
would go
 

741
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,509
would go
from that day from from the 90s

742
00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:37,519
from that day from from the 90s
 

743
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,710
from that day from from the 90s
did you see the

744
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:40,720
did you see the
 

745
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,110
did you see the
growth into learning-based methods into

746
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:43,120
growth into learning-based methods into
 

747
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,470
growth into learning-based methods into
data-driven methods

748
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:44,480
data-driven methods
 

749
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,350
data-driven methods
that followed in the future decades we

750
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:47,360
that followed in the future decades we
 

751
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,150
that followed in the future decades we
certainly thought

752
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:48,160
certainly thought
 

753
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:53,269
certainly thought
that learning was important i guess we

754
00:12:53,269 --> 00:12:53,279
that learning was important i guess we
 

755
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,550
that learning was important i guess we
we missed it as uh being as important as

756
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:56,560
we missed it as uh being as important as
 

757
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:56,790
we missed it as uh being as important as
it

758
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:56,800
it
 

759
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,350
it
as it is today we missed this idea of

760
00:12:59,350 --> 00:12:59,360
as it is today we missed this idea of
 

761
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,030
as it is today we missed this idea of
big data we missed that uh

762
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:01,040
big data we missed that uh
 

763
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,110
big data we missed that uh
uh the idea of deep learning hadn't been

764
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:03,120
uh the idea of deep learning hadn't been
 

765
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,389
uh the idea of deep learning hadn't been
invented yet

766
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:04,399
invented yet
 

767
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,990
invented yet
we could have uh taken the book from a

768
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:08,000
we could have uh taken the book from a
 

769
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,310
we could have uh taken the book from a
complete uh machine learning point of

770
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:10,320
complete uh machine learning point of
 

771
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,190
complete uh machine learning point of
view

view
 

773
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,350
view
right from the start we chose to do it

774
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:13,360
right from the start we chose to do it
 

775
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,509
right from the start we chose to do it
more from a point of view of we're going

776
00:13:15,509 --> 00:13:15,519
more from a point of view of we're going
 

777
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:16,790
more from a point of view of we're going
to first develop

778
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:16,800
to first develop
 

779
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,269
to first develop
different types of representations and

780
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:19,279
different types of representations and
 

781
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,069
different types of representations and
we're going to talk

782
00:13:20,069 --> 00:13:20,079
we're going to talk
 

783
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,910
we're going to talk
about different types of environments of

784
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:23,920
about different types of environments of
 

785
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,750
about different types of environments of
is it fully observable or partially

00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:25,760
is it fully observable or partially
 

787
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,350
is it fully observable or partially
observable and is it

788
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:27,360
observable and is it
 

789
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,590
observable and is it
deterministic or stochastic and so on

790
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:29,600
deterministic or stochastic and so on
 

791
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,550
deterministic or stochastic and so on
and we

792
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:30,560
and we
 

793
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,350
and we
made it more complex along those axes

794
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:33,360
made it more complex along those axes
 

795
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,710
made it more complex along those axes
rather than

796
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:34,720
rather than
 

797
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,550
rather than
focusing on the machine learning axis

798
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:36,560
focusing on the machine learning axis
 

799
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,829
focusing on the machine learning axis
first

800
00:13:37,829 --> 00:13:37,839
first
 

801
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,910
first
do you think you know there's some sense

802
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:39,920
do you think you know there's some sense
 

803
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,949
do you think you know there's some sense
in which the deep learning craze

804
00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:42,959
in which the deep learning craze
 

805
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,710
in which the deep learning craze
is extremely successful for a particular

806
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:44,720
is extremely successful for a particular
 

807
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,310
is extremely successful for a particular
set of problems

808
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:46,320
set of problems
 

809
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,430
set of problems
and you know eventually it's going to in

810
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:49,440
and you know eventually it's going to in
 

811
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,110
and you know eventually it's going to in
the general case

812
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:51,120
the general case
 

813
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,069
the general case
hit challenges so in terms of the

814
00:13:54,069 --> 00:13:54,079
hit challenges so in terms of the
 

815
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:55,189
hit challenges so in terms of the
difference between

816
00:13:55,189 --> 00:13:55,199
difference between
 

817
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,829
difference between
perception systems and robots that have

818
00:13:57,829 --> 00:13:57,839
perception systems and robots that have
 

819
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:58,870
perception systems and robots that have
to act in the world

820
00:13:58,870 --> 00:13:58,880
to act in the world
 

821
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,069
to act in the world
do you think uh we're going to return to

822
00:14:02,069 --> 00:14:02,079
do you think uh we're going to return to
 

823
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:06,069
do you think uh we're going to return to
ai modern approach type breadth

824
00:14:06,069 --> 00:14:06,079
ai modern approach type breadth
 

825
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,110
ai modern approach type breadth
in addition five and six yeah

826
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:09,120
in addition five and six yeah
 

827
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,829
in addition five and six yeah
in uh in future decades do you think

828
00:14:11,829 --> 00:14:11,839
in uh in future decades do you think
 

829
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:13,509
in uh in future decades do you think
deep learning will take its place as a

830
00:14:13,509 --> 00:14:13,519
deep learning will take its place as a
 

831
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,590
deep learning will take its place as a
chapter and as

832
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:15,600
chapter and as
 

833
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,389
chapter and as
in his bigger uh view of ai yeah i think

834
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:18,399
in his bigger uh view of ai yeah i think
 

835
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,910
in his bigger uh view of ai yeah i think
we don't know yet how it's all going to

836
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:19,920
we don't know yet how it's all going to
 

837
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,030
we don't know yet how it's all going to
play out

838
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:21,040
play out
 

839
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,310
play out
so uh in the new edition uh we have a

840
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:24,320
so uh in the new edition uh we have a
 

841
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,590
so uh in the new edition uh we have a
chapter on deep learning

842
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:25,600
chapter on deep learning
 

843
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,790
chapter on deep learning
uh we got ian goodfellow to be the guest

844
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:28,800
uh we got ian goodfellow to be the guest
 

845
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,350
uh we got ian goodfellow to be the guest
author

846
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:29,360
author
 

847
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,670
author
for that chapter so he said he could

848
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:31,680
for that chapter so he said he could
 

849
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,389
for that chapter so he said he could
condense

850
00:14:32,389 --> 00:14:32,399
condense
 

851
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,350
condense
his whole deep learning book into one

852
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:35,360
his whole deep learning book into one
 

853
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,069
his whole deep learning book into one
chapter i think he did a great job

854
00:14:38,069 --> 00:14:38,079
chapter i think he did a great job
 

855
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,310
chapter i think he did a great job
we were also encouraged that he's you

856
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:40,320
we were also encouraged that he's you
 

857
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,350
we were also encouraged that he's you
know we gave him

858
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:41,360
know we gave him
 

859
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,269
know we gave him
the old neural net chapter and said

860
00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:45,279
the old neural net chapter and said
 

861
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,509
the old neural net chapter and said
have fun with it modernize that and he

862
00:14:47,509 --> 00:14:47,519
have fun with it modernize that and he
 

863
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,790
have fun with it modernize that and he
said you know half of that

864
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:48,800
said you know half of that
 

865
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,150
said you know half of that
was okay that certainly there's lots of

866
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:52,160
was okay that certainly there's lots of
 

867
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,910
was okay that certainly there's lots of
new things that have been developed

868
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:53,920
new things that have been developed
 

869
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,990
new things that have been developed
but some of the core was still the same

870
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:58,000
but some of the core was still the same
 

871
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,509
but some of the core was still the same
so i think we'll gain a better

872
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:01,519
so i think we'll gain a better
 

873
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,150
so i think we'll gain a better
understanding of what you can do there

874
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:04,160
understanding of what you can do there
 

875
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,189
understanding of what you can do there
i think we'll need to incorporate all

876
00:15:07,189 --> 00:15:07,199
i think we'll need to incorporate all
 

877
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:08,550
i think we'll need to incorporate all
the things we can do with the other

878
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:08,560
the things we can do with the other
 

879
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,590
the things we can do with the other
technologies

880
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:09,600
technologies
 

881
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,110
technologies
right so deep learning started out

882
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:13,120
right so deep learning started out
 

883
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,949
right so deep learning started out
convolutional networks and very close to

884
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:16,959
convolutional networks and very close to
 

885
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,310
convolutional networks and very close to
perception

886
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:18,320
perception
 

887
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,150
perception
uh and has since moved to be uh

888
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:22,160
uh and has since moved to be uh
 

889
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,870
uh and has since moved to be uh
to be able to do more with actions and

890
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:24,880
to be able to do more with actions and
 

891
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,990
to be able to do more with actions and
some degree of

892
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:26,000
some degree of
 

893
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,189
some degree of
longer term planning but we need to do a

894
00:15:29,189 --> 00:15:29,199
longer term planning but we need to do a
 

895
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:30,150
longer term planning but we need to do a
better job

896
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:30,160
better job
 

897
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,389
better job
with representation than reasoning and

898
00:15:34,389 --> 00:15:34,399
with representation than reasoning and
 

899
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,910
with representation than reasoning and
one-shot learning and so on and

900
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:37,920
one-shot learning and so on and
 

901
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,749
one-shot learning and so on and
well i think we don't know yet how

902
00:15:39,749 --> 00:15:39,759
well i think we don't know yet how
 

903
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:40,949
well i think we don't know yet how
that's going to play out

904
00:15:40,949 --> 00:15:40,959
that's going to play out
 

905
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:44,790
that's going to play out
so do you think looking at the

906
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:44,800
so do you think looking at the
 

907
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,910
so do you think looking at the
some success but certainly uh

908
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:47,920
some success but certainly uh
 

909
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,949
some success but certainly uh
eventual demise the partial demise of

910
00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:50,959
eventual demise the partial demise of
 

911
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,389
eventual demise the partial demise of
experts to symbolic

912
00:15:52,389 --> 00:15:52,399
experts to symbolic
 

913
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,030
experts to symbolic
systems in the 80s do you think there is

914
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:55,040
systems in the 80s do you think there is
 

915
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,550
systems in the 80s do you think there is
kernels of wisdom

916
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:56,560
kernels of wisdom
 

917
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,189
kernels of wisdom
in the work that was done there with

918
00:15:59,189 --> 00:15:59,199
in the work that was done there with
 

919
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,030
in the work that was done there with
logic and reasoning and so on

920
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:01,040
logic and reasoning and so on
 

921
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,590
logic and reasoning and so on
that will rise again in your view

922
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:05,600
that will rise again in your view
 

923
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,829
that will rise again in your view
so certainly i think the idea of

924
00:16:07,829 --> 00:16:07,839
so certainly i think the idea of
 

925
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:09,269
so certainly i think the idea of
representation and reasoning

926
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:09,279
representation and reasoning
 

927
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,629
representation and reasoning
is crucial that you know sometimes you

928
00:16:12,629 --> 00:16:12,639
is crucial that you know sometimes you
 

929
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,230
is crucial that you know sometimes you
just don't have enough data about the

930
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:14,240
just don't have enough data about the
 

931
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,670
just don't have enough data about the
world to learn

932
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:15,680
world to learn
 

933
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:20,389
world to learn
de novo so you've got to have

934
00:16:20,389 --> 00:16:20,399
de novo so you've got to have
 

935
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,310
de novo so you've got to have
some idea of representation whether that

936
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:22,320
some idea of representation whether that
 

937
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,870
some idea of representation whether that
was programmed in or told or whatever

938
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:24,880
was programmed in or told or whatever
 

939
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,350
was programmed in or told or whatever
and then be able to take uh steps of

940
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:27,360
and then be able to take uh steps of
 

941
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,550
and then be able to take uh steps of
reasoning

942
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:28,560
reasoning
 

943
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,829
reasoning
i i think the problem uh with

944
00:16:31,829 --> 00:16:31,839
i i think the problem uh with
 

945
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,269
i i think the problem uh with
the you know the good old-fashioned ai

946
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:35,279
the you know the good old-fashioned ai
 

947
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,990
the you know the good old-fashioned ai
was uh one we tried to base everything

948
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:38,000
was uh one we tried to base everything
 

949
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,110
was uh one we tried to base everything
on these uh

950
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:39,120
on these uh
 

951
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,389
on these uh
symbols that were atomic

952
00:16:42,389 --> 00:16:42,399
symbols that were atomic
 

953
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,710
symbols that were atomic
and that's great if you're like trying

954
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:44,720
and that's great if you're like trying
 

955
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,949
and that's great if you're like trying
to define the properties of a triangle

956
00:16:46,949 --> 00:16:46,959
to define the properties of a triangle
 

957
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,710
to define the properties of a triangle
right because they have necessary

958
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:48,720
right because they have necessary
 

959
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,230
right because they have necessary
insufficient conditions

960
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:50,240
insufficient conditions
 

961
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,910
insufficient conditions
uh but things in the real world don't

962
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:51,920
uh but things in the real world don't
 

963
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,150
uh but things in the real world don't
the real world is is messy and doesn't

964
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:54,160
the real world is is messy and doesn't
 

965
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,189
the real world is is messy and doesn't
have sharp edges

966
00:16:55,189 --> 00:16:55,199
have sharp edges
 

967
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,629
have sharp edges
and atomic symbols do so that was a poor

968
00:16:58,629 --> 00:16:58,639
and atomic symbols do so that was a poor
 

969
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,550
and atomic symbols do so that was a poor
match

970
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:00,560
match
 

971
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:05,029
match
and then the other aspect was that the

972
00:17:05,029 --> 00:17:05,039
and then the other aspect was that the
 

973
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,069
and then the other aspect was that the
reasoning was universal and applied

974
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:08,079
reasoning was universal and applied
 

975
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,189
reasoning was universal and applied
anywhere which in some sense is good but

976
00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:11,199
anywhere which in some sense is good but
 

977
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,189
anywhere which in some sense is good but
it also means there's no guidance

978
00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:13,199
it also means there's no guidance
 

979
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,750
it also means there's no guidance
as to where to apply it and so you you

980
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:15,760
as to where to apply it and so you you
 

981
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,669
as to where to apply it and so you you
know you started getting these paradoxes

982
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:17,679
know you started getting these paradoxes
 

983
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:18,150
know you started getting these paradoxes
like

984
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:18,160
like
 

985
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,870
like
uh well if i have a mountain and i

986
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:20,880
uh well if i have a mountain and i
 

987
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,429
uh well if i have a mountain and i
remove

988
00:17:21,429 --> 00:17:21,439
remove
 

989
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,429
remove
one grain of sand then it's still a

990
00:17:23,429 --> 00:17:23,439
one grain of sand then it's still a
 

991
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:24,949
one grain of sand then it's still a
mountain and

992
00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:24,959
mountain and
 

993
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,549
mountain and
but if i do that repeatedly at some

994
00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:26,559
but if i do that repeatedly at some
 

995
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,069
but if i do that repeatedly at some
point it's not

996
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:28,079
point it's not
 

997
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,350
point it's not
right and with logic you know there's

998
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:31,360
right and with logic you know there's
 

999
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:31,990
right and with logic you know there's
nothing to stop

1000
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:32,000
nothing to stop
 

1001
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,190
nothing to stop
you from applying things uh repeatedly

1002
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:37,200
you from applying things uh repeatedly
 

1003
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,110
you from applying things uh repeatedly
but maybe with something like

1004
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:41,120
but maybe with something like
 

1005
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,630
but maybe with something like
deep learning and i don't really know

1006
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:42,640
deep learning and i don't really know
 

1007
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,470
deep learning and i don't really know
what the right name for it is

1008
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:44,480
what the right name for it is
 

1009
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,789
what the right name for it is
we could separate out those ideas so one

1010
00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:46,799
we could separate out those ideas so one
 

1011
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,070
we could separate out those ideas so one
we could say

1012
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:48,080
we could say
 

1013
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,110
we could say
uh you know a mountain isn't just an

1014
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:51,120
uh you know a mountain isn't just an
 

1015
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:51,830
uh you know a mountain isn't just an
atomic

1016
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:51,840
atomic
 

1017
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,549
atomic
notion it it's some sort of something

1018
00:17:54,549 --> 00:17:54,559
notion it it's some sort of something
 

1019
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,310
notion it it's some sort of something
like uh word embedding that

1020
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:56,320
like uh word embedding that
 

1021
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,430
like uh word embedding that
uh uh has a

1022
00:17:59,430 --> 00:17:59,440
uh uh has a
 

1023
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,270
uh uh has a
a more complex representation yeah and

1024
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:03,280
a more complex representation yeah and
 

1025
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,190
a more complex representation yeah and
secondly we could somehow learn yeah

1026
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:05,200
secondly we could somehow learn yeah
 

1027
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,549
secondly we could somehow learn yeah
there's this rule that you can remove

1028
00:18:06,549 --> 00:18:06,559
there's this rule that you can remove
 

1029
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:07,830
there's this rule that you can remove
one grain of sand

1030
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:07,840
one grain of sand
 

1031
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,350
one grain of sand
and you can do that a bunch of times but

1032
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:09,360
and you can do that a bunch of times but
 

1033
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,510
and you can do that a bunch of times but
you can't do it a near infinite amount

1034
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:11,520
you can't do it a near infinite amount
 

1035
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,710
you can't do it a near infinite amount
of times

1036
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:12,720
of times
 

1037
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,630
of times
but on the other hand when you're doing

1038
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:14,640
but on the other hand when you're doing
 

1039
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,830
but on the other hand when you're doing
induction on the integer

1040
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:15,840
induction on the integer
 

1041
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,590
induction on the integer
sure then it's fine to do it an infinite

1042
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:17,600
sure then it's fine to do it an infinite
 

1043
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,190
sure then it's fine to do it an infinite
number of times and

1044
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:19,200
number of times and
 

1045
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,150
number of times and
if we could uh somehow we have to learn

1046
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:22,160
if we could uh somehow we have to learn
 

1047
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,710
if we could uh somehow we have to learn

where why does it succeed so brilliantly
 

1073
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,110
where why does it succeed so brilliantly
on so many in so many cases

1074
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:53,120
on so many in so many cases
 

1075
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,510
on so many in so many cases
and fail so miserably in surprising ways

1076
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:55,520
and fail so miserably in surprising ways
 

1077
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,390

so what do you think is this is uh

1080
00:18:59,909 --> 00:18:59,919
so what do you think is this is uh
 

1081
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,710
so what do you think is this is uh
the future there can simply more data

1082
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:02,720
the future there can simply more data
 

1083
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,549
the future there can simply more data
better data more organized data

1084
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:04,559
better data more organized data
 

1085
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,590
better data more organized data
solve that problem or is there

1086
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:07,600
solve that problem or is there
 

1087
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,350

elements of symbolic systems that need

to be brought in which are a little bit

to be brought in which are a little bit
 

1091
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,070
to be brought in which are a little bit
more explainable

1092
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:12,080
more explainable
 

1093
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,990
more explainable
yeah so i prefer to talk about

1094
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:16,000
yeah so i prefer to talk about
 

1095
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,310
yeah so i prefer to talk about
trust and uh validation and verification

1096
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:20,320
trust and uh validation and verification
 

1097
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,390
trust and uh validation and verification
rather than just about explainability

1098
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:22,400
rather than just about explainability
 

1099
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,669
rather than just about explainability
and then i think uh

1100
00:19:23,669 --> 00:19:23,679
and then i think uh
 

1101
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:26,310
and then i think uh
explanations are one tool that you use

1102
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:26,320
explanations are one tool that you use
 

1103
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,789
explanations are one tool that you use
towards those goals

1104
00:19:28,789 --> 00:19:28,799
towards those goals
 

1105
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:31,270
towards those goals
and i think it is important issue that

1106
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:31,280
and i think it is important issue that
 

1107
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,630
and i think it is important issue that
we don't want to use these systems

1108
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:32,640
we don't want to use these systems
 

1109
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,350
we don't want to use these systems
unless we

1110
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:33,360
unless we
 

1111
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,789
unless we
trust them and we want to understand

1112
00:19:34,789 --> 00:19:34,799
trust them and we want to understand
 

1113
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:35,909
trust them and we want to understand
where they work and where they don't

1114
00:19:35,909 --> 00:19:35,919
where they work and where they don't
 

1115
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:37,029
where they work and where they don't
work

1116
00:19:37,029 --> 00:19:37,039
work
 

1117
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,350
work
and in an explanation can be part of

1118
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:39,360
and in an explanation can be part of
 

1119
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,230
and in an explanation can be part of
that

1120
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:40,240
that
 

1121
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,270
that
right so i apply for loan and i get

1122
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:43,280
right so i apply for loan and i get
 

1123
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,070
right so i apply for loan and i get
denied i want some explanation of why

1124
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:46,080
denied i want some explanation of why
 

1125
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,029
denied i want some explanation of why
and

1126
00:19:47,029 --> 00:19:47,039
and
 

1127
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,310
and
you have in europe we have the gdpr that

1128
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:50,320
you have in europe we have the gdpr that
 

1129
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:50,870
you have in europe we have the gdpr that
says

1130
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:50,880
says
 

1131
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,750
says
you're required to be able to get that

1132
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:53,760
you're required to be able to get that
 

1133
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,789
you're required to be able to get that
but on the other hand

1134
00:19:54,789 --> 00:19:54,799
but on the other hand
 

1135
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:58,710
but on the other hand
explanation alone is not enough right so

1136
00:19:58,710 --> 00:19:58,720
explanation alone is not enough right so
 

1137
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,470
explanation alone is not enough right so
you know we're used to dealing with

1138
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:00,480
you know we're used to dealing with
 

1139
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,070
you know we're used to dealing with
people and with the

1140
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:02,080
people and with the
 

1141
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,630
people and with the
organizations and corporations and so on

1142
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:04,640
organizations and corporations and so on
 

1143
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,070
organizations and corporations and so on
and they can give you an explanation

1144
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:06,080
and they can give you an explanation
 

1145
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,669
and they can give you an explanation
then you have no guarantee that that

1146
00:20:07,669 --> 00:20:07,679
then you have no guarantee that that
 

1147
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,909
then you have no guarantee that that
explanation relates to reality

1148
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:09,919
explanation relates to reality
 

1149
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,870
explanation relates to reality
right right so the bank can tell me well

1150
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:12,880
right right so the bank can tell me well
 

1151
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,830
right right so the bank can tell me well
you didn't get the loan

1152
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:13,840
you didn't get the loan
 

1153
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,630
you didn't get the loan
because you didn't have enough

1154
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:14,640
because you didn't have enough
 

1155
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,270
because you didn't have enough
collateral and that may be true or

1156

collateral and that may be true or
 

1157
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,870
collateral and that may be true or
it may be true that they just didn't

1158
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:18,880
it may be true that they just didn't
 

1159
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,470
it may be true that they just didn't
like my religion

1160
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:20,480
like my religion
 

1161
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,590
like my religion
or or something else i can't tell from

1162
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:23,600
or or something else i can't tell from
 

1163
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,270
or or something else i can't tell from
the explanation and that's

1164
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:25,280
the explanation and that's
 

1165
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,029
the explanation and that's
that's true whether the decision was

1166
00:20:27,029 --> 00:20:27,039
that's true whether the decision was
 

1167
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,310
that's true whether the decision was
made by computer

1168
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:28,320
made by computer
 

1169
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:33,350
made by computer
or by a person so i want more

1170
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:33,360
or by a person so i want more
 

1171
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,110
or by a person so i want more
i do want to have the explanations and i

1172
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:35,120
i do want to have the explanations and i
 

1173
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,470
i do want to have the explanations and i
want to be able to uh have a

1174
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:36,480
want to be able to uh have a
 

1175
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,710
want to be able to uh have a
conversation to go back and forth

1176
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:38,720
conversation to go back and forth
 

1177
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,390
conversation to go back and forth
and said well you gave this explanation

1178
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:40,400
and said well you gave this explanation
 

1179
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,830
and said well you gave this explanation
but what about this

1180
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:41,840
but what about this
 

1181
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,510
but what about this
and what would have happened if this had

1182
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:43,520
and what would have happened if this had
 

1183
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,950
and what would have happened if this had
happened and uh

1184
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:44,960
happened and uh
 

1185
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,070
happened and uh
what would i need to change that so i

1186
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:48,080
what would i need to change that so i
 

1187
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,270
what would i need to change that so i
think a conversation is

1188
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:49,280
think a conversation is
 

1189
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,029
think a conversation is
is a better way to think about it than

1190
00:20:51,029 --> 00:20:51,039
is a better way to think about it than
 

1191
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:55,110
is a better way to think about it than
just an explanation as a single output

1192
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:55,120
just an explanation as a single output
 

1193
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,950
just an explanation as a single output
and i think we need testing of various

1194
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:56,960
and i think we need testing of various
 

1195
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,630
and i think we need testing of various
kinds right so in order to know

1196
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:00,640
kinds right so in order to know
 

1197
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,710
kinds right so in order to know
was the decision really based on my

1198
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:02,720
was the decision really based on my
 

1199
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,070
was the decision really based on my
collateral or was it

1200
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:04,080
collateral or was it
 

1201
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,870
collateral or was it
based on my uh religion or skin color or

1202
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:06,880
based on my uh religion or skin color or
 

1203
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,230
based on my uh religion or skin color or
whatever

1204
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:08,240
whatever
 

1205
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,909
whatever
i can't tell if i'm only looking at my

1206
00:21:09,909 --> 00:21:09,919
i can't tell if i'm only looking at my
 

1207
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:12,950
i can't tell if i'm only looking at my
case but if i look across all the cases

1208
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:12,960
case but if i look across all the cases
 

1209
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,190
case but if i look across all the cases
then i can detect a pattern all right

1210
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:15,200
then i can detect a pattern all right
 

1211
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,710
then i can detect a pattern all right
right so you want to have that kind of

1212
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:16,720
right so you want to have that kind of
 

1213
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,909
right so you want to have that kind of
capability

1214
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:17,919
capability
 

1215
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:20,070
capability
uh you want to have these adversarial

1216
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:20,080
uh you want to have these adversarial
 

1217
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,669
uh you want to have these adversarial
testing right so we thought we were

1218
00:21:21,669 --> 00:21:21,679
testing right so we thought we were
 

1219
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:22,950
testing right so we thought we were
doing pretty good

1220
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:22,960
doing pretty good
 

1221
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,070
doing pretty good
at object recognition in images we said

1222
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:26,080
at object recognition in images we said
 

1223
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:26,870
at object recognition in images we said
look

1224
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:26,880
look
 

1225
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,710
look
we're at sort of pretty close to human

1226
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:28,720
we're at sort of pretty close to human
 

1227
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,070
we're at sort of pretty close to human
level performance on

1228
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:30,080
level performance on
 

1229
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,710
level performance on
imagenet and so on and then you start

1230
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:32,720
imagenet and so on and then you start
 

1231
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,510
imagenet and so on and then you start
seeing these

1232
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:33,520
seeing these
 

1233
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,270
seeing these
adversarial images and you say wait a

1234
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:35,280
adversarial images and you say wait a
 

1235
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,590
adversarial images and you say wait a
minute that part is nothing like

1236
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:37,600
minute that part is nothing like
 

1237
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,070
minute that part is nothing like
human performance okay you can mess with

1238
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:40,080
human performance okay you can mess with
 

1239
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,430
human performance okay you can mess with
it really easily you can mess with it

1240
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:41,440
it really easily you can mess with it
 

1241
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,230
it really easily you can mess with it
really easily

1242
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:42,240
really easily
 

1243
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,149
really easily
right and uh yeah you could do that to

1244
00:21:44,149 --> 00:21:44,159
right and uh yeah you could do that to
 

1245
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:45,909
right and uh yeah you could do that to
humans too right so

1246
00:21:45,909 --> 00:21:45,919
humans too right so
 

1247
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:47,669
humans too right so
in a different way perhaps right humans

1248
00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:47,679
in a different way perhaps right humans
 

1249
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,350
in a different way perhaps right humans
don't know what color the dress was

1250
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:49,360
don't know what color the dress was
 

1251
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,590
don't know what color the dress was
right and so they're vulnerable to

1252
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:51,600
right and so they're vulnerable to
 

1253
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,029
right and so they're vulnerable to
certain attacks that are different

1254
00:21:53,029 --> 00:21:53,039
certain attacks that are different
 

1255
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,590
certain attacks that are different
than the attacks on the on the machines

1256
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:55,600
than the attacks on the on the machines
 

1257
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,310
than the attacks on the on the machines
but the

1258
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:56,320
but the
 

1259
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,830
but the
you know the tax on the machines are so

1260
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:57,840
you know the tax on the machines are so
 

1261
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,310
you know the tax on the machines are so
striking uh they really change the way

1262
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:00,320
striking uh they really change the way
 

1263
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,909
striking uh they really change the way
you think about what we've done

1264
00:22:01,909 --> 00:22:01,919
you think about what we've done
 

1265
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,029
you think about what we've done
right and the the way i think about it

1266
00:22:05,029 --> 00:22:05,039
right and the the way i think about it
 

1267
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,190
right and the the way i think about it
is i think part of the problem is we're

1268
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:07,200
is i think part of the problem is we're
 

1269
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,149
is i think part of the problem is we're
seduced

1270
00:22:08,149 --> 00:22:08,159
seduced
 

1271
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:11,270
seduced
by uh our low dimensional

1272
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:11,280
by uh our low dimensional
 

1273
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,789
by uh our low dimensional
metaphors right yeah so you know you

1274
00:22:14,789 --> 00:22:14,799
metaphors right yeah so you know you
 

1275
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:15,669
metaphors right yeah so you know you
look like that phrase

1276
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:15,679
look like that phrase
 

1277
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,470
look like that phrase
you look in uh in a textbook and you say

1278
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:18,480
you look in uh in a textbook and you say
 

1279
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,470
you look in uh in a textbook and you say
okay now we've mapped out the space and

1280
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:20,480
okay now we've mapped out the space and
 

1281
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,430
okay now we've mapped out the space and
you know

1282
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:21,440
you know
 

1283
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,870
you know
uh cat is here and dog is here

1284
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:24,880
uh cat is here and dog is here
 

1285
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,630
uh cat is here and dog is here
and maybe there's a tiny little spot in

1286
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:26,640
and maybe there's a tiny little spot in
 

1287
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,149
and maybe there's a tiny little spot in
the middle where you can't tell the

1288
00:22:28,149 --> 00:22:28,159
the middle where you can't tell the
 

1289
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:29,590
the middle where you can't tell the
difference but mostly we've got it all

1290
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:29,600
difference but mostly we've got it all
 

1291
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,630
difference but mostly we've got it all
covered

1292
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:30,640
covered
 

1293
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,350
covered
and if you believe that metaphor uh then

1294
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:33,360
and if you believe that metaphor uh then
 

1295
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,950
and if you believe that metaphor uh then
you say well we're nearly there

1296
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:34,960
you say well we're nearly there
 

1297
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,110
you say well we're nearly there
and uh you know there's only going to be

1298
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:37,120
and uh you know there's only going to be
 

1299
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,029
and uh you know there's only going to be
a couple adversarial images

1300
00:22:39,029 --> 00:22:39,039
a couple adversarial images
 

1301
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,470
a couple adversarial images
but i think that's the wrong metaphor

1302
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:40,480
but i think that's the wrong metaphor
 

1303
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,230
but i think that's the wrong metaphor
and what you should really say is

1304
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:42,240
and what you should really say is
 

1305
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,549
and what you should really say is
it's not a 2d flat space that we've got

1306
00:22:44,549 --> 00:22:44,559
it's not a 2d flat space that we've got
 

1307
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:45,830
it's not a 2d flat space that we've got
mostly covered

1308
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:45,840
mostly covered
 

1309
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,630
mostly covered
it's a million dimension space and a cat

1310
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:48,640
it's a million dimension space and a cat
 

1311
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,950
it's a million dimension space and a cat
is this string that goes out in this

1312
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:50,960
is this string that goes out in this
 

1313
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,830
is this string that goes out in this
crazy

1314
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:51,840
crazy
 

1315
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,470
crazy
bath and if you step a little bit off

1316
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:54,480
bath and if you step a little bit off
 

1317
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,149
bath and if you step a little bit off
the path in any direction you're in

1318
00:22:56,149 --> 00:22:56,159
the path in any direction you're in
 

1319
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:57,350
the path in any direction you're in
nowhere's

1320
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:57,360
nowhere's
 

1321
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,549
nowhere's
land and you don't know what's going to

1322
00:22:58,549 --> 00:22:58,559
land and you don't know what's going to
 

1323
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,630
land and you don't know what's going to
happen and so i think that's where we

1324
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:00,640
happen and so i think that's where we
 

1325
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,110
happen and so i think that's where we
are

1326
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:01,120
are
 

1327
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,230
are
and now we've got to deal with that so

1328
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:04,240
and now we've got to deal with that so
 

1329
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,230
and now we've got to deal with that so
uh it wasn't so much an explanation but

1330
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:06,240
uh it wasn't so much an explanation but
 

1331
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,230
uh it wasn't so much an explanation but
it was an understanding

1332
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:08,240
it was an understanding
 

1333
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,230
it was an understanding
of what the models are and what they're

1334
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:10,240
of what the models are and what they're
 

1335
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,909
of what the models are and what they're
doing and now we can start exploring how

1336
00:23:11,909 --> 00:23:11,919
doing and now we can start exploring how
 

1337
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:12,789
doing and now we can start exploring how
do you fix that

1338
00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:12,799
do you fix that
 

1339
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,470
do you fix that
yeah validating the robustness of the

1340
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:14,480
yeah validating the robustness of the
 

1341
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,110
yeah validating the robustness of the
system so on but take it back to the

1342
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:17,120
system so on but take it back to the
 

1343
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,230
system so on but take it back to the
this uh this word trust uh do you think

1344
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:20,240
this uh this word trust uh do you think
 

1345
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:20,630
this uh this word trust uh do you think
we're

1346
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:20,640
we're
 

1347
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,350
we're
a little too hard on our robots in terms

1348
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:23,360
a little too hard on our robots in terms
 

1349
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,669
a little too hard on our robots in terms
of uh the standards we apply

1350
00:23:25,669 --> 00:23:25,679
of uh the standards we apply
 

1351
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,710
of uh the standards we apply
so you know

1352
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:28,720
so you know
 

1353
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,070
so you know
of uh there's a dance there's a

1354
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:32,080
of uh there's a dance there's a
 

1355
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,909
of uh there's a dance there's a
there's a there's a dance and nonverbal

1356
00:23:33,909 --> 00:23:33,919
there's a there's a dance and nonverbal
 

1357
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,470
there's a there's a dance and nonverbal
and verbal communication between humans

1358
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:36,480
and verbal communication between humans
 

1359
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,230
and verbal communication between humans
you know if we apply the same kind of

1360
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:38,240
you know if we apply the same kind of
 

1361
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,390
you know if we apply the same kind of
standard in terms of humans

1362
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:40,400
standard in terms of humans
 

1363
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,230
standard in terms of humans
you know we trust each other pretty

1364
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:42,240
you know we trust each other pretty
 

1365
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,830
you know we trust each other pretty
quickly uh

1366
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:43,840
quickly uh
 

1367
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,430
quickly uh
you know you and i haven't met before

1368
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:45,440
you know you and i haven't met before
 

1369
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,990
you know you and i haven't met before
and there's some degree of trust

1370

and there's some degree of trust
 

1371
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,230
and there's some degree of trust
right that nothing's gonna go crazy

1372
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:50,240
right that nothing's gonna go crazy
 

1373
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,750
right that nothing's gonna go crazy
wrong and yet to ai

1374
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:51,760
wrong and yet to ai
 

1375
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,870
wrong and yet to ai
when we look at ai systems where we seem

1376
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:54,880
when we look at ai systems where we seem
 

1377
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,909
when we look at ai systems where we seem
to approach

1378
00:23:55,909 --> 00:23:55,919
to approach
 

1379
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,870
to approach
uh through skepticism always always and

1380
00:23:58,870 --> 00:23:58,880
uh through skepticism always always and
 

1381
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,830
uh through skepticism always always and
it's like they

1382
00:23:59,830 --> 00:23:59,840
it's like they
 

1383
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,950
it's like they
have to prove through a lot of hard work

1384
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:02,960
have to prove through a lot of hard work
 

1385
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,269
have to prove through a lot of hard work
that they're even worthy of uh even

1386
00:24:05,269 --> 00:24:05,279
that they're even worthy of uh even
 

1387
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:06,630
that they're even worthy of uh even
inkling of our trust do it

1388
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:06,640
inkling of our trust do it
 

1389
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,830
inkling of our trust do it
what do you what do you think about that

1390
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:07,840
what do you what do you think about that
 

1391
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,310
what do you what do you think about that
how how do we break that barrier close

1392
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:10,320
how how do we break that barrier close
 

1393
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,110
how how do we break that barrier close
that gap

1394
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:11,120
that gap
 

1395
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,310
that gap
i think that's right i think that's a

1396
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:12,320
i think that's right i think that's a
 

1397
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,510
i think that's right i think that's a
big issue uh just listening uh my friend

1398

and he says uh the most amazing thing
 

1403
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,149
and he says uh the most amazing thing
about humans

yeah he says chimpanzees cannot do that
 

1419
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,350
yeah he says chimpanzees cannot do that
yeah right

1420

yeah right
 

1421
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,470
yeah right
right if the chimpanzee's in a situation

1422
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:40,480
right if the chimpanzee's in a situation
 

1423

right if the chimpanzee's in a situation
where

1424

where
 

1425
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,510
where
here's some that aren't from my tribe

1426

shop there's delicious food around you

1430
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:48,720
shop there's delicious food around you
 

1431

shop there's delicious food around you
know

1432
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:48,960
know
 

1433
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,430
know
yeah yeah but but we humans have figured

1434
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:51,440
yeah yeah but but we humans have figured
 

1435
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,549
yeah yeah but but we humans have figured
that out yeah right

1436
00:24:52,549 --> 00:24:52,559
that out yeah right
 

1437
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:55,029
that out yeah right
uh and you know for the most part for

1438
00:24:55,029 --> 00:24:55,039
uh and you know for the most part for
 

1439
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:56,549
uh and you know for the most part for
the most part we still go to war

1440
00:24:56,549 --> 00:24:56,559
the most part we still go to war
 

1441
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,310
the most part we still go to war
we still do terrible things uh but for

1442
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:58,320
we still do terrible things uh but for
 

1443
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,990
we still do terrible things uh but for
the most part we've learned to

1444
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:00,000
the most part we've learned to
 

1445
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,789
the most part we've learned to
trust each other and live together uh so

1446
00:25:02,789 --> 00:25:02,799
trust each other and live together uh so
 

1447
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:04,390
trust each other and live together uh so
that's going to be important

1448
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:04,400
that's going to be important
 

1449
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,310
that's going to be important
for our uh our ai systems as well

1450
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:08,320
for our uh our ai systems as well
 

1451
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,950
for our uh our ai systems as well
and i th also i think uh you know a lot

1452
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:10,960
and i th also i think uh you know a lot
 

1453
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,830
and i th also i think uh you know a lot
of the emphasis

1454
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:11,840
of the emphasis
 

1455
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:16,230
of the emphasis
is on ai but in many cases

1456
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:16,240
is on ai but in many cases
 

1457
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,310
is on ai but in many cases
ai is part of the technology but isn't

1458
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:18,320
ai is part of the technology but isn't
 

1459
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,310
ai is part of the technology but isn't
really the main thing so a lot of

1460
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:20,320
really the main thing so a lot of
 

1461
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,190
really the main thing so a lot of
what we've seen is more due to

1462
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:23,200
what we've seen is more due to
 

1463
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,110
what we've seen is more due to
communications technology

1464
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:25,120
communications technology
 

1465
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,830
communications technology
than ai ai technology yeah you want to

1466
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:27,840
than ai ai technology yeah you want to
 

1467
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,549
than ai ai technology yeah you want to
make

1468
00:25:28,549 --> 00:25:28,559
make
 

1469
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,510
make
these good decisions but the reason

1470
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:31,520
these good decisions but the reason
 

1471
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,110
these good decisions but the reason
we're able to have any kind of system at

1472
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:33,120
we're able to have any kind of system at
 

1473
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:33,990
we're able to have any kind of system at
all

1474
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:34,000
all
 

1475
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,990
all

of moocs of education online yeah it was

1516
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:13,520
of moocs of education online yeah it was
 

1517
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,230
of moocs of education online yeah it was
a great fun

1518

a great fun
 

1519
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,350
a great fun
doing it particularly uh being

1520
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:17,360
doing it particularly uh being
 

1521
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,630
doing it particularly uh being
right at the start just because it was

1522
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:20,640
right at the start just because it was
 

1523
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,510
right at the start just because it was
exciting and new

1524
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:21,520
exciting and new
 

1525
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,950
exciting and new
but it also meant that we had less

1526
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:22,960
but it also meant that we had less
 

1527
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,549
but it also meant that we had less
competition

1528
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:24,559
competition
 

1529
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:26,710
competition
right so uh one of the things you hear

1530
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:26,720
right so uh one of the things you hear
 

1531
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,190
right so uh one of the things you hear
about uh well the problem with moocs is

1532
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:29,200
about uh well the problem with moocs is
 

1533
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,149
about uh well the problem with moocs is
uh the completion rates are are so low

1534
00:26:32,149 --> 00:26:32,159
uh the completion rates are are so low
 

1535
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:33,750
uh the completion rates are are so low
so there must be a failure

1536
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:33,760
so there must be a failure
 

1537
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,470
so there must be a failure
and and i gotta admit i'm a prime

but i got exactly what i wanted out of
them because i had never intended to

1548
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:45,520
them because i had never intended to
 

1549
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,590
them because i had never intended to
finish them i just wanted to

dabble in a little bit either to see the

1552
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:49,520
dabble in a little bit either to see the
 

1553
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,669
dabble in a little bit either to see the
topic matter or just to see the pedagogy

1554
00:26:51,669 --> 00:26:51,679
topic matter or just to see the pedagogy
 

1555
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:54,630
topic matter or just to see the pedagogy
of how are they doing this class

so i guess the main thing i learned is
 

1559
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:57,990
so i guess the main thing i learned is
when i came in

1560
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:58,000
when i came in
 

1561
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,909
when i came in
i thought the challenge was

thing that
if students don't stick with it it

1584
00:27:26,149 --> 00:27:26,159
if students don't stick with it it
 

1585
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:29,430

and i think being one of the first
 

1589
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:32,710
and i think being one of the first
classes

1590
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:32,720
classes
 

1591
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,909
classes

up ways for uh
you know the community to work with each

1602
00:27:45,029 --> 00:27:45,039
you know the community to work with each
 

1603
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:46,870
you know the community to work with each
other to make it more motivating

you know it would never have the
 

1623
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:05,430
you know it would never have the
opportunity

1624
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:05,440
opportunity
 

1625
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,909

they can be successful in a way they
couldn't before

1636
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:18,720
couldn't before
 

1637
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,870
couldn't before
but that's really just the top tier of

1638
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:20,880
but that's really just the top tier of
 

1639
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,789
but that's really just the top tier of
people that are ready to do that the

1640
00:28:22,789 --> 00:28:22,799
people that are ready to do that the
 

1641
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:25,029
people that are ready to do that the
rest of the people

1642
00:28:25,029 --> 00:28:25,039
rest of the people
 

1643
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:28,630
rest of the people
just don't see or don't have their

1644
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:28,640
just don't see or don't have their
 

1645
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,870
just don't see or don't have their
motivation and don't see how if they

1646
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:30,880
motivation and don't see how if they
 

1647
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,549
motivation and don't see how if they
push through and were able to do it

1648
00:28:32,549 --> 00:28:32,559
push through and were able to do it
 

1649
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,710
push through and were able to do it
what advantage that would get them so i

1650
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:34,720
what advantage that would get them so i
 

1651
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,070
what advantage that would get them so i
think we've got a long way to go

1652
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:36,080
think we've got a long way to go
 

1653
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,149
think we've got a long way to go
before we're able to do that and i think

1654
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:38,159
before we're able to do that and i think
 

1655
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:39,669
before we're able to do that and i think
it'll be some of it is

1656
00:28:39,669 --> 00:28:39,679
it'll be some of it is
 

1657
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:41,590
it'll be some of it is
based on technology but more of it's

1658
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:41,600
based on technology but more of it's
 

1659
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,070
based on technology but more of it's
based on the idea of community that you

1660
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:44,080
based on the idea of community that you
 

1661
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:44,630
based on the idea of community that you
got to

1662
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:44,640
got to
 

1663
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,669
got to
actually get people together some of the

1664
00:28:47,669 --> 00:28:47,679
actually get people together some of the
 

1665
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:49,350
actually get people together some of the
getting together can be done online i

1666
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:49,360
getting together can be done online i
 

1667
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,110
getting together can be done online i
think some of it really has to be done

1668
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:51,120
think some of it really has to be done
 

1669
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,029
think some of it really has to be done
in person to be able in order to build

1670
00:28:53,029 --> 00:28:53,039
in person to be able in order to build
 

1671
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,470
in person to be able in order to build
that type of

1672
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:54,480
that type of
 

1673
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,190
that type of
community and trust you know there's an

1674
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:57,200
community and trust you know there's an
 

1675
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,230
community and trust you know there's an
intentional

1676
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:58,240
intentional
 

1677
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,110
intentional
mechanism that we've developed uh a

1678
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:01,120
mechanism that we've developed uh a
 

1679
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,549
mechanism that we've developed uh a
short attention span

1680
00:29:02,549 --> 00:29:02,559
short attention span
 

1681
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:05,350
short attention span
especially younger people uh because

1682
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:05,360
especially younger people uh because
 

1683
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,070
especially younger people uh because
sort of

1684
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:06,080
sort of
 

1685
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,710
sort of
shorter and shorter videos online uh

1686
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:08,720
shorter and shorter videos online uh
 

1687
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,590
shorter and shorter videos online uh
there's a

1688
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:09,600
there's a
 

1689
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,230
there's a
whatever the the way the brain is

1690
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:12,240
whatever the the way the brain is
 

1691
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,669
whatever the the way the brain is
developing now

1692
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:13,679
developing now
 

1693
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:15,750
developing now
with people that have grown up with the

1694
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:15,760
with people that have grown up with the
 

1695
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,669
with people that have grown up with the
internet they have a quite a short

1696
00:29:17,669 --> 00:29:17,679
internet they have a quite a short
 

1697
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:19,190
internet they have a quite a short
attention span so

1698
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:19,200
attention span so
 

1699
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,269
attention span so
and i would say i had the same when i

1700
00:29:21,269 --> 00:29:21,279
and i would say i had the same when i
 

1701
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:22,230
and i would say i had the same when i
was growing up too

1702
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:22,240
was growing up too
 

1703
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,870
was growing up too
probably for different reasons so i

1704
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:24,880
probably for different reasons so i
 

1705
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,950
probably for different reasons so i
probably wouldn't have

1706
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:26,960
probably wouldn't have
 

1707
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,710
probably wouldn't have
learned as much as i have if i wasn't

1708
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:28,720
learned as much as i have if i wasn't
 

1709
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,269
learned as much as i have if i wasn't
forced to sit in a physical classroom

1710
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:31,279
forced to sit in a physical classroom
 

1711
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:33,830
forced to sit in a physical classroom
sort of bored sometimes falling asleep

1712
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:33,840
sort of bored sometimes falling asleep
 

1713
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,750
sort of bored sometimes falling asleep
but sort of forcing myself through that

1714
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:35,760
but sort of forcing myself through that
 

1715
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,470
but sort of forcing myself through that
process

1716
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:36,480
process
 

1717
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,909
process
to sometimes extremely difficult

1718
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:37,919
to sometimes extremely difficult
 

1719
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:39,909
to sometimes extremely difficult
computer science courses

1720
00:29:39,909 --> 00:29:39,919
computer science courses
 

1721
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:42,070
computer science courses
what's the difference in your view

1722
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:42,080
what's the difference in your view
 

1723
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,870
what's the difference in your view
between in-person

1724
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:44,880
between in-person
 

1725
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,909
between in-person
education experience which you first of

1726
00:29:47,909 --> 00:29:47,919
education experience which you first of
 

1727
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:48,149
education experience which you first of
all

1728
00:29:48,149 --> 00:29:48,159
all
 

1729
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,149
all
yourself had and you yourself taught and

1730
00:29:50,149 --> 00:29:50,159
yourself had and you yourself taught and
 

1731
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:51,909
yourself had and you yourself taught and
online education

1732
00:29:51,909 --> 00:29:51,919
online education
 

1733
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:53,430
online education
and how do we close that gap if it's

1734
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:53,440
and how do we close that gap if it's
 

1735
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,029
and how do we close that gap if it's
even possible yeah

1736
00:29:55,029 --> 00:29:55,039
even possible yeah
 

1737
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:58,310
even possible yeah
so i think there's two issues one is

1738
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:58,320
so i think there's two issues one is
 

1739
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,789
so i think there's two issues one is
whether it's in person or online so it's

1740
00:30:00,789 --> 00:30:00,799
whether it's in person or online so it's
 

1741
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:01,669
whether it's in person or online so it's
sort of the physical

1742
00:30:01,669 --> 00:30:01,679
sort of the physical
 

1743
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:05,029
sort of the physical
location and then the other is kind of

1744
00:30:05,029 --> 00:30:05,039
location and then the other is kind of
 

1745
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:05,510
location and then the other is kind of
the

1746
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:05,520
the
 

1747
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,710
the
affiliation right so

1748
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:08,720
affiliation right so
 

1749
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,510
affiliation right so
you stuck with it in part because you

1750
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:11,520
you stuck with it in part because you
 

1751
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,110
you stuck with it in part because you
were in the classroom and you saw

1752
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:13,120
were in the classroom and you saw
 

1753
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,350
were in the classroom and you saw
everybody else was suffering right the

1754
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:15,360
everybody else was suffering right the
 

1755
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,269
everybody else was suffering right the
same way you were

1756
00:30:17,269 --> 00:30:17,279
same way you were
 

1757
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:20,230
same way you were
but also because you were enrolled you

1758
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:20,240
but also because you were enrolled you
 

1759
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,070
but also because you were enrolled you
had paid tuition

1760
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:22,080
had paid tuition
 

1761
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,909
had paid tuition
sort of everybody was expecting you to

1762
00:30:23,909 --> 00:30:23,919
sort of everybody was expecting you to
 

1763
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:25,350
sort of everybody was expecting you to
stick with it

1764
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:25,360
stick with it
 

1765
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,710
stick with it
society parents yeah peers

1766
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:28,720
society parents yeah peers
 

1767
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,630
society parents yeah peers
right and so those are two separate

1768
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:30,640
right and so those are two separate
 

1769
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,830
right and so those are two separate
things i mean you could certainly

1770
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:31,840
things i mean you could certainly
 

1771
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,870
things i mean you could certainly
imagine

1772
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:32,880
imagine
 

1773
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,669
imagine
i pay a huge amount of tuition and

1774
00:30:35,669 --> 00:30:35,679
i pay a huge amount of tuition and
 

1775
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:37,350
i pay a huge amount of tuition and
everybody signed up and says yes you're

1776
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:37,360
everybody signed up and says yes you're
 

1777
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,310
everybody signed up and says yes you're
doing this

1778
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:38,320
doing this
 

1779
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,870
doing this
uh but then i'm in my room and my

1780
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:40,880
uh but then i'm in my room and my
 

1781
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,549
uh but then i'm in my room and my
classmates are in are in different rooms

1782
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:42,559
classmates are in are in different rooms
 

1783
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:43,110
classmates are in are in different rooms
right

1784
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:43,120
right
 

1785
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,149
right
we could have things set up that way so

1786
00:30:46,149 --> 00:30:46,159
we could have things set up that way so
 

1787
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:48,710
we could have things set up that way so
it's not just the online versus offline

1788
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:48,720
it's not just the online versus offline
 

1789
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,389
it's not just the online versus offline
i think what's more important is the

1790
00:30:50,389 --> 00:30:50,399
i think what's more important is the
 

1791
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:51,830
i think what's more important is the
commitment

1792
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:51,840
commitment
 

1793
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,870
commitment
that you've made and

1794
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:54,880
that you've made and
 

1795
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,870
that you've made and
certainly it is important to have that

1796
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:56,880
certainly it is important to have that
 

1797
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,509
certainly it is important to have that
kind of informal

1798
00:30:59,509 --> 00:30:59,519
kind of informal
 

1799
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:01,590
kind of informal
you know i meet people outside of class

1800
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:01,600
you know i meet people outside of class
 

1801
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,509
you know i meet people outside of class
we talk together because we're all in it

1802
00:31:03,509 --> 00:31:03,519
we talk together because we're all in it
 

1803
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:04,789
we talk together because we're all in it
together

1804
00:31:04,789 --> 00:31:04,799
together
 

1805
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:08,070
together
i think that's uh really important both

1806
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:08,080
i think that's uh really important both
 

1807
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,630
i think that's uh really important both
in keeping your motivation and also

1808
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:10,640
in keeping your motivation and also
 

1809
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,190
in keeping your motivation and also
that's where

1810
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:11,200
that's where
 

1811
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,710
that's where
some of the most important learning goes

1812
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:12,720
some of the most important learning goes
 

1813
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,350
some of the most important learning goes
on so you want to have that

1814
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:15,360
on so you want to have that
 

1815
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,750
on so you want to have that
maybe you know especially now we start

1816
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:17,760
maybe you know especially now we start
 

1817
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,710
maybe you know especially now we start
getting into

1818
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:18,720
getting into
 

1819
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,350
getting into
higher bandwidths and augmented reality

1820
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:21,360
higher bandwidths and augmented reality
 

1821
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,110
higher bandwidths and augmented reality
and virtual reality you might be able to

1822
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:23,120
and virtual reality you might be able to
 

1823
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,789
and virtual reality you might be able to
get that without being in the same

1824
00:31:24,789 --> 00:31:24,799
get that without being in the same
 

1825
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,389
get that without being in the same
physical place do you think it's

1826
00:31:26,389 --> 00:31:26,399
physical place do you think it's
 

1827
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:28,870
physical place do you think it's
possible we'll see a course

1828
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:28,880
possible we'll see a course
 

1829
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,710
possible we'll see a course
at stanford for example that

1830
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:32,720
at stanford for example that
 

1831
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,430
at stanford for example that
for students enrolled students is only

1832
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:35,440
for students enrolled students is only
 

1833
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,470
for students enrolled students is only
online

1834
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:36,480
online
 

1835
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,149
online
in the near future who are literally

1836
00:31:38,149 --> 00:31:38,159
in the near future who are literally
 

1837
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:39,669
in the near future who are literally
sort of that's part of the curriculum

1838
00:31:39,669 --> 00:31:39,679
sort of that's part of the curriculum
 

1839
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:40,470
sort of that's part of the curriculum
and there is

1840
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:40,480
and there is
 

1841
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,789
and there is
no yeah so you're starting to see that i

1842
00:31:42,789 --> 00:31:42,799
no yeah so you're starting to see that i
 

1843
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:44,070
no yeah so you're starting to see that i
know uh georgia tech

1844
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:44,080
know uh georgia tech
 

1845
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,549
know uh georgia tech
has a master's that's done that way

1846
00:31:46,549 --> 00:31:46,559
has a master's that's done that way
 

1847
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:47,430
has a master's that's done that way
oftentimes

1848
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:47,440
oftentimes
 

1849
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,430
oftentimes
it's sort of they're creeping in in

1850
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:49,440
it's sort of they're creeping in in
 

1851
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,430
it's sort of they're creeping in in
terms of a master's program or sort of

1852
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:51,440
terms of a master's program or sort of
 

1853
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,470
terms of a master's program or sort of
um

1854
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:52,480
um
 

1855
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,789
um
further education considering the

1856
00:31:54,789 --> 00:31:54,799
further education considering the
 

1857
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:56,470
further education considering the
constraints of students and so on

1858
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:56,480
constraints of students and so on
 

1859
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,669
constraints of students and so on
but i mean literally is it possible that

1860
00:31:59,669 --> 00:31:59,679
but i mean literally is it possible that
 

1861
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:02,710
but i mean literally is it possible that
we just you know stanford mit berkeley

1862
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:02,720
we just you know stanford mit berkeley
 

1863
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,830
we just you know stanford mit berkeley
all these places go

1864
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:03,840
all these places go
 

1865
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,630
all these places go
online only in uh in the next few

1866
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:06,640
online only in uh in the next few
 

1867
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,830
online only in uh in the next few
decades

1868
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:07,840
decades
 

1869
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,269
decades
yeah probably not because you know

1870
00:32:09,269 --> 00:32:09,279
yeah probably not because you know
 

1871
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:11,509
yeah probably not because you know
they've got a big commitment to

1872
00:32:11,509 --> 00:32:11,519
they've got a big commitment to
 

1873
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:15,509
they've got a big commitment to
a physical campus sure right

1874
00:32:15,509 --> 00:32:15,519
a physical campus sure right
 

1875
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:17,590
a physical campus sure right
there's a momentum that's both financial

1876
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:17,600
there's a momentum that's both financial
 

1877
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,950
there's a momentum that's both financial
and culturally right and

1878
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:18,960
and culturally right and
 

1879
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,070
and culturally right and
and then there are certain things that

1880
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:22,080
and then there are certain things that
 

1881
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:26,070
and then there are certain things that
just hard to do uh virtually right so

1882
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:26,080
just hard to do uh virtually right so
 

1883
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,190
just hard to do uh virtually right so
you know we're in a field uh where uh

1884
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:29,200
you know we're in a field uh where uh
 

1885
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,789
you know we're in a field uh where uh
if you have your own computer and your

1886
00:32:30,789 --> 00:32:30,799
if you have your own computer and your
 

1887
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:32,789
if you have your own computer and your
own paper

1888
00:32:32,789 --> 00:32:32,799
own paper
 

1889
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:34,870
own paper
and so on uh you can do the work

1890
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:34,880
and so on uh you can do the work
 

1891
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,909
and so on uh you can do the work
anywhere

1892
00:32:35,909 --> 00:32:35,919
anywhere
 

1893
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:38,230
anywhere
uh but if you're in a biology lab or

1894
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:38,240
uh but if you're in a biology lab or
 

1895
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,389
uh but if you're in a biology lab or
something uh you know

1896
00:32:40,389 --> 00:32:40,399
something uh you know
 

1897
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:41,750
something uh you know
you don't have all the right stuff at

1898
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:41,760
you don't have all the right stuff at
 

1899
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,669
you don't have all the right stuff at
home right

1900
00:32:43,669 --> 00:32:43,679
home right
 

1901
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:46,149
home right
so our field programming you've also

1902
00:32:46,149 --> 00:32:46,159
so our field programming you've also
 

1903
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:47,350
so our field programming you've also
done a lot of

1904
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:47,360
done a lot of
 

1905
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,549
done a lot of
you've done a lot of programming

1906
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:48,559
you've done a lot of programming
 

1907
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,870
you've done a lot of programming
yourself

1908
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:50,880
yourself
 

1909
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,669
yourself
in 2001 you wrote a great article about

1910
00:32:53,669 --> 00:32:53,679
in 2001 you wrote a great article about
 

1911
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:55,029
in 2001 you wrote a great article about
programming called

1912
00:32:55,029 --> 00:32:55,039
programming called
 

1913
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:57,190
programming called
teach yourself programming in 10 years

1914
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:57,200
teach yourself programming in 10 years
 

1915
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,630
teach yourself programming in 10 years
sort of response to

1916
00:32:58,630 --> 00:32:58,640
sort of response to
 

1917
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,070
sort of response to
all the books that say teach yourself

1918
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:00,080
all the books that say teach yourself
 

1919
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,830
all the books that say teach yourself
programming in 21 days so if you're

1920
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:01,840
programming in 21 days so if you're
 

1921
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,269
programming in 21 days so if you're
giving advice to someone getting into

1922
00:33:03,269 --> 00:33:03,279
giving advice to someone getting into
 

1923
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:04,710
giving advice to someone getting into
programming today

1924
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:04,720
programming today
 

1925
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,470
programming today
this is a few years since you've written

1926
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:06,480
this is a few years since you've written
 

1927
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,310
this is a few years since you've written
that article what's the best way to

1928
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:08,320
that article what's the best way to
 

1929
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,710
that article what's the best way to
undertake that journey

1930
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:10,720
undertake that journey
 

1931
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,230
undertake that journey
i think there's lots of different ways

1932
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:12,240
i think there's lots of different ways
 

1933
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,789
i think there's lots of different ways
and i think programming means more

1934
00:33:14,789 --> 00:33:14,799
and i think programming means more
 

1935
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:15,350
and i think programming means more
things

1936
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:15,360
things
 

1937
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,950
things
now and i guess you know when i wrote

1938
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:18,960
now and i guess you know when i wrote
 

1939
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:19,990
now and i guess you know when i wrote
that article

1940
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:20,000
that article
 

1941
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,190
that article
i was thinking more about

1942
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:23,200
i was thinking more about
 

1943
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,870
i was thinking more about
becoming a professional software

1944
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:24,880
becoming a professional software
 

1945
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,870
becoming a professional software
engineer and i thought that's a

1946
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:26,880
engineer and i thought that's a
 

1947
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,669
engineer and i thought that's a
you know a sort of a career-long field

1948
00:33:29,669 --> 00:33:29,679
you know a sort of a career-long field
 

1949
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:31,350
you know a sort of a career-long field
of study

1950
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:31,360
of study
 

1951
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,269
of study
but i think there's lots of things now

1952
00:33:33,269 --> 00:33:33,279
but i think there's lots of things now
 

1953
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:35,110
but i think there's lots of things now
that people can do

1954
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:35,120
that people can do
 

1955
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:38,950
that people can do
where programming is a part of

1956
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:38,960
where programming is a part of
 

1957
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,590
where programming is a part of
solving what they want to solve without

1958
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:41,600
solving what they want to solve without
 

1959
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,470
solving what they want to solve without
achieving that professional level status

1960
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:44,480
achieving that professional level status
 

1961
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,750
achieving that professional level status
right so i'm not going to be going and

1962
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:45,760
right so i'm not going to be going and
 

1963
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,669
right so i'm not going to be going and
writing a million lines of code

1964
00:33:47,669 --> 00:33:47,679
writing a million lines of code
 

1965
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:49,830
writing a million lines of code
but you know i'm a biologist or a

1966
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:49,840
but you know i'm a biologist or a
 

1967
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,509
but you know i'm a biologist or a
physicist or something

1968
00:33:51,509 --> 00:33:51,519
physicist or something
 

1969
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:54,950
physicist or something
or even a historian and i've got some

1970
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:54,960
or even a historian and i've got some
 

1971
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,590
or even a historian and i've got some
data

1972
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:55,600
data
 

1973
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,350
data
and i want to ask a question of that

1974
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:57,360
and i want to ask a question of that
 

1975
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,269
and i want to ask a question of that
data and i think

1976
00:33:59,269 --> 00:33:59,279
data and i think
 

1977
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,990
data and i think
for that you don't need 10 years right

1978
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:02,000
for that you don't need 10 years right
 

1979
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,630
for that you don't need 10 years right
so

1980
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:02,640
so
 

1981
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,350
so
there are many shortcuts to being able

1982
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:05,360
there are many shortcuts to being able
 

1983
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,389
there are many shortcuts to being able
to

1984
00:34:06,389 --> 00:34:06,399
to
 

1985
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:08,869
to
answer those kinds of questions and and

1986
00:34:08,869 --> 00:34:08,879
answer those kinds of questions and and
 

1987
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:10,950
answer those kinds of questions and and
you know you see today a lot of

1988
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:10,960
you know you see today a lot of
 

1989
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:14,069
you know you see today a lot of
emphasis on learning to code

1990
00:34:14,069 --> 00:34:14,079
emphasis on learning to code
 

1991
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:16,950
emphasis on learning to code
teaching kids how to code uh i think

1992
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:16,960
teaching kids how to code uh i think
 

1993
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,149
teaching kids how to code uh i think
that's great

1994
00:34:18,149 --> 00:34:18,159
that's great
 

1995
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:19,990
that's great
uh but i wish they would change the

1996
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:20,000
uh but i wish they would change the
 

1997
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,669
uh but i wish they would change the
message a little bit

1998
00:34:21,669 --> 00:34:21,679
message a little bit
 

1999
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:24,389
message a little bit
right so i think code isn't the main

2000
00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:24,399
right so i think code isn't the main
 

2001
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:25,990
right so i think code isn't the main
thing i don't really care if you know

2002
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:26,000
thing i don't really care if you know
 

2003
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:26,389
thing i don't really care if you know
the

2004
00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:26,399
the
 

2005
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:29,990
the
syntax of javascript or if you can

2006
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:30,000
syntax of javascript or if you can
 

2007
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,669
syntax of javascript or if you can
connect these blocks together in this

2008
00:34:31,669 --> 00:34:31,679
connect these blocks together in this
 

2009
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,270
connect these blocks together in this
visual language

2010
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:33,280
visual language
 

2011
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,909
visual language
but what i do care about is that you can

2012
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:35,919
but what i do care about is that you can
 

2013
00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:38,149
but what i do care about is that you can
analyze a problem

2014
00:34:38,149 --> 00:34:38,159
analyze a problem
 

2015
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:42,629
analyze a problem
you can think of a solution you can

2016
00:34:42,629 --> 00:34:42,639
you can think of a solution you can
 

2017
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:45,669
you can think of a solution you can
carry out you know make a model

2018
00:34:45,669 --> 00:34:45,679
carry out you know make a model
 

2019
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:48,230
carry out you know make a model
run that model test the model see the

2020
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:48,240
run that model test the model see the
 

2021
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,869
run that model test the model see the
results

2022
00:34:50,869 --> 00:34:50,879
results
 

2023
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:53,829
results
verify that they're reasonable ask

2024
00:34:53,829 --> 00:34:53,839
verify that they're reasonable ask
 

2025
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:55,270
verify that they're reasonable ask
questions and answer them

2026
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:55,280
questions and answer them
 

2027
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,670
questions and answer them
right so it's more modeling and problem

2028
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:57,680
right so it's more modeling and problem
 

2029
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,470
right so it's more modeling and problem
solving

2030
00:34:58,470 --> 00:34:58,480
solving
 

2031
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,750
solving
and you use coding in order to do that

2032
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:01,760
and you use coding in order to do that
 

2033
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,430
and you use coding in order to do that
but it's not just learning coding for

2034
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:03,440
but it's not just learning coding for
 

2035
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,109
but it's not just learning coding for
its own sake that's really interesting

2036
00:35:05,109 --> 00:35:05,119
its own sake that's really interesting
 

2037
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:05,589
its own sake that's really interesting
so

2038
00:35:05,589 --> 00:35:05,599
so
 

2039
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:08,310
so
it's actually almost in many cases it's

2040
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:08,320
it's actually almost in many cases it's
 

2041
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,910
it's actually almost in many cases it's
learning to work with data

2042
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:09,920
learning to work with data
 

2043
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,829
learning to work with data
to extract something useful out of data

2044
00:35:11,829 --> 00:35:11,839
to extract something useful out of data
 

2045
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:13,589
to extract something useful out of data
so when you say problem solving

2046
00:35:13,589 --> 00:35:13,599
so when you say problem solving
 

2047
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:15,190
so when you say problem solving
you really mean taking some kind of

2048
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:15,200
you really mean taking some kind of
 

2049
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,589
you really mean taking some kind of
maybe collecting some kind of data set

2050
00:35:17,589 --> 00:35:17,599
maybe collecting some kind of data set
 

2051
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:19,349
maybe collecting some kind of data set
cleaning it up and saying something

2052
00:35:19,349 --> 00:35:19,359
cleaning it up and saying something
 

2053
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:21,190
cleaning it up and saying something
interesting about it which is useful in

2054
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:21,200
interesting about it which is useful in
 

2055
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,950
interesting about it which is useful in
all kinds of domains

2056
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:22,960
all kinds of domains
 

2057
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,390
all kinds of domains
and you know and i see myself

2058
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:26,400
and you know and i see myself
 

2059
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,109
and you know and i see myself
being stuck sometimes in kind of the the

2060
00:35:29,109 --> 00:35:29,119
being stuck sometimes in kind of the the
 

2061
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:30,069
being stuck sometimes in kind of the the
old ways

2062
00:35:30,069 --> 00:35:30,079
old ways
 

2063
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:32,470
old ways
right so you know be working on a

2064
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:32,480
right so you know be working on a
 

2065
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,069
right so you know be working on a
project

2066
00:35:34,069 --> 00:35:34,079
project
 

2067
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:37,589
project
maybe with a younger employee and we say

2068
00:35:37,589 --> 00:35:37,599
maybe with a younger employee and we say
 

2069
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:39,270
maybe with a younger employee and we say
oh well here's this new package that

2070
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:39,280
oh well here's this new package that
 

2071
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,030
oh well here's this new package that
could help solve this

2072
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:41,040
could help solve this
 

2073
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,349
could help solve this
problem and i'll go and i'll start

2074
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:43,359
problem and i'll go and i'll start
 

2075
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:45,750
problem and i'll go and i'll start
reading the manuals and you know i'll be

2076
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:45,760
reading the manuals and you know i'll be
 

2077
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,630
reading the manuals and you know i'll be
two hours into reading the manuals and

2078
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:48,640
two hours into reading the manuals and
 

2079
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,190
two hours into reading the manuals and
then

2080
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:49,200
then
 

2081
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,550
then
my colleague comes back and says i'm

2082
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:50,560
my colleague comes back and says i'm
 

2083
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,630
my colleague comes back and says i'm
done yeah you know i downloaded the

2084
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:52,640
done yeah you know i downloaded the
 

2085
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,390
done yeah you know i downloaded the
package i installed it i tried calling

2086
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:54,400
package i installed it i tried calling
 

2087
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,190
package i installed it i tried calling
some things

2088
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:55,200
some things
 

2089
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,950
some things
the first one didn't work the second one

2090
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:56,960
the first one didn't work the second one
 

2091
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,230
the first one didn't work the second one
work now i'm done

2092
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:58,240
work now i'm done
 

2093
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,470
work now i'm done
yeah and i say but i have 100 questions

2094
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:00,480
yeah and i say but i have 100 questions
 

2095
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,589
yeah and i say but i have 100 questions
about how does this work and how does

2096
00:36:01,589 --> 00:36:01,599
about how does this work and how does
 

2097
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:02,950
about how does this work and how does
that work and they say

2098
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:02,960
that work and they say
 

2099
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,470
that work and they say
who cares right i don't need to

2100
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:04,480
who cares right i don't need to
 

2101
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,069
who cares right i don't need to
understand the whole thing i unders i

2102
00:36:06,069 --> 00:36:06,079
understand the whole thing i unders i
 

2103
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:07,589
understand the whole thing i unders i
answered my question

2104
00:36:07,589 --> 00:36:07,599
answered my question
 

2105
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,349
answered my question
it's a big complicated package i don't

2106
00:36:09,349 --> 00:36:09,359
it's a big complicated package i don't
 

2107
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:10,870
it's a big complicated package i don't
understand the rest of it but

2108
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:10,880
understand the rest of it but
 

2109
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,109
understand the rest of it but
i got the right answer and i'm just it's

2110
00:36:13,109 --> 00:36:13,119
i got the right answer and i'm just it's
 

2111
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:14,310
i got the right answer and i'm just it's
hard for me

2112
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:14,320
hard for me
 

2113
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,390
hard for me
to get into that mindset i want to

2114
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:16,400
to get into that mindset i want to
 

2115
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,069
to get into that mindset i want to
understand the whole thing and you know

2116
00:36:18,069 --> 00:36:18,079
understand the whole thing and you know
 

2117
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:19,270
understand the whole thing and you know
if they wrote a manual

2118
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:19,280
if they wrote a manual
 

2119
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,150
if they wrote a manual
i should probably read it and but that's

2120
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:22,160
i should probably read it and but that's
 

2121
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,910
i should probably read it and but that's
not necessarily the right way i think i

2122
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:23,920
not necessarily the right way i think i
 

2123
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,310
not necessarily the right way i think i
have to get used to

2124
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:26,320
have to get used to
 

2125
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,510
have to get used to
dealing with more being more comfortable

2126
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:29,520
dealing with more being more comfortable
 

2127
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,950
dealing with more being more comfortable
with uncertainty and not knowing

2128
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:30,960
with uncertainty and not knowing
 

2129
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,190
with uncertainty and not knowing
everything yeah so i struggle with the

2130
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:33,200
everything yeah so i struggle with the
 

2131
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,550
everything yeah so i struggle with the
same instead of the

2132
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:34,560
same instead of the
 

2133
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,470
same instead of the
the spectrum between donald and don

2134
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:36,480
the spectrum between donald and don
 

2135
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,589
the spectrum between donald and don
knuth yeah

2136
00:36:37,589 --> 00:36:37,599
knuth yeah
 

2137
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:39,990
knuth yeah
it was kind of the very you know before

2138
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:40,000
it was kind of the very you know before
 

2139
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,750
it was kind of the very you know before
he can say anything

2140
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:41,760
he can say anything
 

2141
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,109
he can say anything
about a problem he really has to get

2142
00:36:43,109 --> 00:36:43,119
about a problem he really has to get
 

2143
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:45,349
about a problem he really has to get
down to the machine code assembly

2144
00:36:45,349 --> 00:36:45,359
down to the machine code assembly
 

2145
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:48,870
down to the machine code assembly
yeah versus exactly what you said i've

2146
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:48,880
yeah versus exactly what you said i've
 

2147
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,030
yeah versus exactly what you said i've
have several students in my group that

2148
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:51,040
have several students in my group that
 

2149
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,310
have several students in my group that
uh you know

2150
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:52,320
uh you know
 

2151
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,630
uh you know
20 years old and they can solve almost

2152
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:54,640
20 years old and they can solve almost
 

2153
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,790
20 years old and they can solve almost
any problem within a few hours that

2154
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:56,800
any problem within a few hours that
 

2155
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,470
any problem within a few hours that
would take me probably weeks because i

2156
00:36:58,470 --> 00:36:58,480
would take me probably weeks because i
 

2157
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,270
would take me probably weeks because i
would try to

2158
00:36:59,270 --> 00:36:59,280
would try to
 

2159
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,550
would try to
as you said read the manual so

2160
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:02,560
as you said read the manual so
 

2161
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,390
as you said read the manual so
do you think the nature of mastery

2162
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:04,400
do you think the nature of mastery
 

2163
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,630
do you think the nature of mastery
you're you're mentioning biology

2164
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:06,640
you're you're mentioning biology
 

2165
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,630
you're you're mentioning biology
sort of outside disciplines applying

2166
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:10,640
sort of outside disciplines applying
 

2167
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,750
sort of outside disciplines applying
programming but computer scientists

2168
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:13,760
programming but computer scientists
 

2169
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,990
programming but computer scientists
so over time there's higher and higher

2170
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:16,000
so over time there's higher and higher
 

2171
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,310
so over time there's higher and higher
levels of abstraction available now

2172
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:18,320
levels of abstraction available now
 

2173
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,510
levels of abstraction available now
so with uh this week there's a the

2174
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:21,520
so with uh this week there's a the
 

2175
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,630
so with uh this week there's a the
tensorflow summit right so

2176
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:24,640
tensorflow summit right so
 

2177
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,150
tensorflow summit right so
if you're if you're not particularly

2178
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:26,160
if you're if you're not particularly
 

2179
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,910
if you're if you're not particularly
into deep learning but you're still a

2180
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:27,920
into deep learning but you're still a
 

2181
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,870
into deep learning but you're still a
computer scientist

2182
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:28,880
computer scientist
 

2183
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,510
computer scientist
uh you can accomplish an incredible

2184
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:31,520
uh you can accomplish an incredible
 

2185
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,670
uh you can accomplish an incredible
amount with uh tensorflow without really

2186
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:33,680
amount with uh tensorflow without really
 

2187
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,550
amount with uh tensorflow without really
knowing

2188
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:34,560
knowing
 

2189
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,390
knowing
any fundamental internals of machine

2190
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:36,400
any fundamental internals of machine
 

2191
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,550
any fundamental internals of machine
learning do you think the nature of

2192
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:38,560
learning do you think the nature of
 

2193
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,190
learning do you think the nature of
mastery

2194
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:39,200
mastery
 

2195
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,670
mastery
is is changing even for computer

2196
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:41,680
is is changing even for computer
 

2197
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,230
is is changing even for computer
scientists

2198
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:42,240
scientists
 

2199
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,630
scientists
like what it means to be an expert

2200
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:44,640
like what it means to be an expert
 

2201
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,510
like what it means to be an expert
programmer

2202
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:45,520
programmer
 

2203
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,910
programmer
yeah i think that's true you know we

2204
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:47,920
yeah i think that's true you know we
 

2205
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,470
yeah i think that's true you know we
never really should have focused on

2206
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:50,480
never really should have focused on
 

2207
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,710
never really should have focused on
programmer right because it's still it's

2208
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:52,720
programmer right because it's still it's
 

2209
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,589
programmer right because it's still it's
the skill

2210
00:37:53,589 --> 00:37:53,599
the skill
 

2211
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:55,750
the skill
and what we really want to focus on is

2212
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:55,760
and what we really want to focus on is
 

2213
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,870
and what we really want to focus on is
the result so we

2214
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:56,880
the result so we
 

2215
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,150
the result so we
we built this uh ecosystem where the way

2216
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:00,160
we built this uh ecosystem where the way
 

2217
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,190
we built this uh ecosystem where the way
you can get stuff done

2218
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:01,200
you can get stuff done
 

2219
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,230
you can get stuff done
is by programming it yourself at least

2220
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:04,240
is by programming it yourself at least
 

2221
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,109
is by programming it yourself at least
when i started

2222
00:38:05,109 --> 00:38:05,119
when i started
 

2223
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:07,910
when i started
that you know library functions meant

2224
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:07,920
that you know library functions meant
 

2225
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,510
that you know library functions meant
you had square root and that was about

2226
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:09,520
you had square root and that was about
 

2227
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,470
you had square root and that was about
it

2228
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:10,480
it
 

2229
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,670
it
right everything else you built from

2230
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:11,680
right everything else you built from
 

2231
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,990
right everything else you built from
scratch and then we built up an

2232
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:14,000
scratch and then we built up an
 

2233
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,109
scratch and then we built up an
ecosystem where

2234
00:38:15,109 --> 00:38:15,119
ecosystem where
 

2235
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:16,790
ecosystem where
a lot of times well you can download a

2236
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:16,800
a lot of times well you can download a
 

2237
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,310
a lot of times well you can download a
lot of stuff that does

2238
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:18,320
lot of stuff that does
 

2239
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,790
lot of stuff that does
a big part of what you need and so now

2240
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:20,800
a big part of what you need and so now
 

2241
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,550
a big part of what you need and so now
it's more a question of

2242
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:22,560
it's more a question of
 

2243
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,780
it's more a question of
assembly rather than

2244
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:24,790
assembly rather than
 

2245
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:26,069

manufacturing and

2248
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:29,440
manufacturing and
 

2249
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,829
manufacturing and
that's a different way of looking at

2250
00:38:30,829 --> 00:38:30,839
that's a different way of looking at
 

2251
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:33,270
that's a different way of looking at
problems from another perspective in

2252
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:33,280
problems from another perspective in
 

2253
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,870
problems from another perspective in
terms of mastery and

2254
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:34,880
terms of mastery and
 

2255
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,190
terms of mastery and
looking at programmers or people that

2256
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:37,200
looking at programmers or people that
 

2257
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,109
looking at programmers or people that
reason about problems in a computational

2258
00:38:39,109 --> 00:38:39,119
reason about problems in a computational
 

2259
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:39,670
reason about problems in a computational

way
 

2261
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:43,030
way
so google is you know the from the

2262
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:43,040
so google is you know the from the
 

2263
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,630
so google is you know the from the
hiring perspective from the perspective

2264
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:44,640
hiring perspective from the perspective
 

2265
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,829
hiring perspective from the perspective
of hiring or building a team of

2266
00:38:45,829 --> 00:38:45,839
of hiring or building a team of
 

2267
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:47,349
of hiring or building a team of
programmers

2268
00:38:47,349 --> 00:38:47,359
programmers
 

2269
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:48,950
programmers
how do you determine if someone's a good

2270
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:48,960
how do you determine if someone's a good
 

2271
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,550
how do you determine if someone's a good
programmer or

2272
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:50,560
programmer or
 

2273
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,109
programmer or
if somebody again yeah i want to deviate

2274
00:38:53,109 --> 00:38:53,119
if somebody again yeah i want to deviate
 

2275
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:54,710
if somebody again yeah i want to deviate
from i want to move away from the word

2276
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:54,720
from i want to move away from the word
 

2277
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,910
from i want to move away from the word
programmer but

2278
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:55,920
programmer but
 

2279
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,750
programmer but
somebody who can solve problems of

2280
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:57,760
somebody who can solve problems of
 

2281
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,589
somebody who can solve problems of
large-scale data and so on

2282
00:38:59,589 --> 00:38:59,599
large-scale data and so on
 

2283
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:01,990
large-scale data and so on
what's what's uh how do you build a team

2284
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:02,000
what's what's uh how do you build a team
 

2285
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,349
what's what's uh how do you build a team
like that through the interviewing

2286
00:39:03,349 --> 00:39:03,359
like that through the interviewing
 

2287
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:03,910
like that through the interviewing
process

2288
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:03,920
process
 

2289
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,510
process
yeah and i and i think uh as a company

2290
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:07,520
yeah and i and i think uh as a company
 

2291
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,310
yeah and i and i think uh as a company
grows

2292
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:08,320
grows
 

2293
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,349
grows
uh you get more uh expansive

2294
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:11,359
uh you get more uh expansive
 

2295
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:12,870
uh you get more uh expansive
in the types of people you're looking

2296
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:12,880
in the types of people you're looking
 

2297
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,589
in the types of people you're looking
for right so i think you know

2298
00:39:15,589 --> 00:39:15,599
for right so i think you know
 

2299
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:17,750
for right so i think you know
in the early days we'd interview people

2300
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:17,760
in the early days we'd interview people
 

2301
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,829
in the early days we'd interview people
and the question we were trying to ask

2302
00:39:19,829 --> 00:39:19,839
and the question we were trying to ask
 

2303
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:24,870
and the question we were trying to ask
is uh how close are they to jeff dean

2304
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:24,880

 

2305
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,790

and most people were pretty far away but

2306
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:26,800
and most people were pretty far away but
 

2307
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,230
and most people were pretty far away but
we take the ones that were you know not

2308
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:28,240
we take the ones that were you know not
 

2309
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,270
we take the ones that were you know not
that far away

2310
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:29,280
that far away
 

2311
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,349
that far away
and so we got kind of a homogeneous

2312
00:39:31,349 --> 00:39:31,359
and so we got kind of a homogeneous
 

2313
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:33,109
and so we got kind of a homogeneous
group of people who are really great

2314
00:39:33,109 --> 00:39:33,119
group of people who are really great
 

2315
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:34,390
group of people who are really great
programmers

2316
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:34,400
programmers
 

2317
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,349
programmers
then as a company grows you say well we

2318
00:39:37,349 --> 00:39:37,359
then as a company grows you say well we
 

2319
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:38,230
then as a company grows you say well we
don't want everybody

2320
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:38,240
don't want everybody
 

2321
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,069
don't want everybody
to be the same to have the same skill

2322
00:39:40,069 --> 00:39:40,079
to be the same to have the same skill
 

2323
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:42,230
to be the same to have the same skill
set and so now

2324
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:42,240
set and so now
 

2325
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:46,550
set and so now
we're uh hiring uh biologists in our

now
 

2359
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:23,349
now
uh given your background from blisp

2360
00:40:23,349 --> 00:40:23,359
uh given your background from blisp
 

2361
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:26,150
uh given your background from blisp
to a couple decades of programming yeah

2362
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:26,160
to a couple decades of programming yeah
 

2363
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,309
to a couple decades of programming yeah
that's a great question

2364
00:40:28,309 --> 00:40:28,319
that's a great question
 

2365
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:30,550
that's a great question
you know sometimes i try to look at the

2366
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:30,560
you know sometimes i try to look at the
 

2367
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,829
you know sometimes i try to look at the
flexibility

2368
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:31,839
flexibility
 

2369
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:34,870
flexibility
of the design of yes

2370
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:34,880
of the design of yes
 

2371
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,510
of the design of yes
you know this api solves this problem

2372
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:37,520
you know this api solves this problem
 

2373
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,150
you know this api solves this problem
but

2374
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:38,160
but
 

2375
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,750
but
uh where is it going to go in the future

2376
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:39,760
uh where is it going to go in the future
 

2377
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,910
uh where is it going to go in the future
who else is going to want to call this

2378
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:41,920
who else is going to want to call this
 

2379
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,109
who else is going to want to call this
and uh you know are you making it easier

2380
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:45,119
and uh you know are you making it easier
 

2381
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:48,150
and uh you know are you making it easier
for them to do that it's a matter of

2382
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:48,160
for them to do that it's a matter of
 

2383
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:51,510
for them to do that it's a matter of
design is it documentation is it is it

2384
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:51,520
design is it documentation is it is it
 

2385
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,069
design is it documentation is it is it
uh sort of an amorphous thing you can't

2386
00:40:54,069 --> 00:40:54,079
uh sort of an amorphous thing you can't
 

2387
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:54,950
uh sort of an amorphous thing you can't
really put it

2388
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:54,960
really put it
 

2389
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,030
really put it
it's just how it feels if you put

2390
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:57,040
it's just how it feels if you put
 

2391
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,230
it's just how it feels if you put
yourself in the shoes of a developer

2392
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:58,240
yourself in the shoes of a developer
 

2393
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,750
yourself in the shoes of a developer
would you use this kind of thing i think

2394
00:40:59,750 --> 00:40:59,760
would you use this kind of thing i think
 

2395
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,030
would you use this kind of thing i think
it is how you feel

2396
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:01,040
it is how you feel
 

2397
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,510
it is how you feel
right and so yeah documentation is good

2398
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:03,520
right and so yeah documentation is good
 

2399
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,670
right and so yeah documentation is good
uh but it's but it's more a design

2400
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:05,680
uh but it's but it's more a design
 

2401
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,190
uh but it's but it's more a design
question right if you get the design

2402
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:07,200
question right if you get the design
 

2403
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,030
question right if you get the design
right then

2404
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:09,040
right then
 

2405
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,470
right then
people will figure it out whether the

2406
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:10,480
people will figure it out whether the
 

2407
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,550
people will figure it out whether the
documentation is good or not and

2408
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:12,560
documentation is good or not and
 

2409
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,109
documentation is good or not and
and if the design is wrong then it'll be

2410
00:41:15,109 --> 00:41:15,119
and if the design is wrong then it'll be
 

2411
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:16,150
and if the design is wrong then it'll be
harder to use

2412
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:16,160
harder to use
 

2413
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:19,510
harder to use
how have uh you yourself changed as a

2414
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:19,520
how have uh you yourself changed as a
 

2415
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,630
how have uh you yourself changed as a
programmer

2416
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:20,640
programmer
 

2417
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:24,069
programmer
over the years as in in a way we

2418
00:41:24,069 --> 00:41:24,079
over the years as in in a way we
 

2419
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:27,030
over the years as in in a way we
already started to say sort of you want

2420
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:27,040
already started to say sort of you want
 

2421
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,390
already started to say sort of you want
to read the manual you want to

2422
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:28,400
to read the manual you want to
 

2423
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,230
to read the manual you want to
understand the core of the

2424
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:30,240
understand the core of the
 

2425
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,990
understand the core of the
syntax to the how the language is

2426
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:32,000
syntax to the how the language is
 

2427
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,670
syntax to the how the language is
supposed to be used and so on

2428
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:33,680
supposed to be used and so on
 

2429
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:37,349
supposed to be used and so on
but what's the evolution been like from

2430
00:41:37,349 --> 00:41:37,359
but what's the evolution been like from
 

2431
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:40,550
but what's the evolution been like from
the 80s 90s to today

2432
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:40,560
the 80s 90s to today
 

2433
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,390
the 80s 90s to today
i guess one thing is you don't have to

2434
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:42,400
i guess one thing is you don't have to
 

2435
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,829
i guess one thing is you don't have to
worry about

2436
00:41:43,829 --> 00:41:43,839
worry about
 

2437
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:46,630
worry about
the small details of efficiency as much

2438
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:46,640
the small details of efficiency as much
 

2439
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,510
the small details of efficiency as much
as you used to

2440
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:47,520
as you used to
 

2441
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,790
as you used to
right so like i remember uh i did my

2442
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:50,800
right so like i remember uh i did my
 

2443
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,829
right so like i remember uh i did my
list book in the 90s and one of the

2444
00:41:53,829 --> 00:41:53,839
list book in the 90s and one of the
 

2445
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:55,109
list book in the 90s and one of the
things i wanted to do

2446
00:41:55,109 --> 00:41:55,119
things i wanted to do
 

2447
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:57,510
things i wanted to do
was say uh here's how you do an object

2448
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:57,520
was say uh here's how you do an object
 

2449
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,870
was say uh here's how you do an object
system

2450
00:41:58,870 --> 00:41:58,880
system
 

2451
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,430
system
and uh basically we're going to make it

2452
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:01,440
and uh basically we're going to make it
 

2453
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,670
and uh basically we're going to make it
so each object is a hash table and you

2454
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:03,680
so each object is a hash table and you
 

2455
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,190
so each object is a hash table and you
look up the methods and here's how it

2456
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:05,200
look up the methods and here's how it
 

2457
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,230
look up the methods and here's how it
works and then i said

2458
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:06,240
works and then i said
 

2459
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,990
works and then i said
of course the real common lisp

2460
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:10,000
of course the real common lisp
 

2461
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,069
of course the real common lisp
object system is much more complicated

2462
00:42:12,069 --> 00:42:12,079
object system is much more complicated
 

2463
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:13,670
object system is much more complicated
it's got all these efficiency

2464
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:13,680
it's got all these efficiency
 

2465
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,470
it's got all these efficiency
type issues and this is just a toy

2466
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:16,480
type issues and this is just a toy
 

2467
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,790
type issues and this is just a toy
nobody would do this in real life

2468
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:18,800
nobody would do this in real life
 

2469
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,710
nobody would do this in real life
and it turns out python pretty much did

2470
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:20,720
and it turns out python pretty much did
 

2471
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,630
and it turns out python pretty much did
exactly

2472
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:22,640
exactly
 

2473
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:26,390
exactly
what i said yeah and said uh objects are

2474
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:26,400
what i said yeah and said uh objects are
 

2475
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,069
what i said yeah and said uh objects are
just dictionaries and yeah they have a

2476
00:42:28,069 --> 00:42:28,079
just dictionaries and yeah they have a
 

2477
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:30,069
just dictionaries and yeah they have a
few little uh tricks as well

2478
00:42:30,069 --> 00:42:30,079
few little uh tricks as well
 

2479
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:33,670
few little uh tricks as well
but mostly you know the thing that

2480
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:33,680
but mostly you know the thing that
 

2481
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,910
but mostly you know the thing that
would have been 100 times too slow in

2482
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:35,920
would have been 100 times too slow in
 

2483
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,030
would have been 100 times too slow in
the 80s is now

2484
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:37,040
the 80s is now
 

2485
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,349
the 80s is now
plenty fast for most everything so you

2486
00:42:39,349 --> 00:42:39,359
plenty fast for most everything so you
 

2487
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:41,270
plenty fast for most everything so you
had to as a programmer let go

2488
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:41,280
had to as a programmer let go
 

2489
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,309
had to as a programmer let go
of perhaps an obsession

2490
00:42:44,309 --> 00:42:44,319
of perhaps an obsession
 

2491
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:46,309
of perhaps an obsession
that i remember coming up with of trying

2492
00:42:46,309 --> 00:42:46,319
that i remember coming up with of trying
 

2493
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:47,349
that i remember coming up with of trying
to write

2494
00:42:47,349 --> 00:42:47,359
to write
 

2495
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:50,150
to write
efficient code yeah that to say you know

2496
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:50,160
efficient code yeah that to say you know
 

2497
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,270
efficient code yeah that to say you know
what really matters

2498
00:42:51,270 --> 00:42:51,280
what really matters
 

2499
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,870
what really matters
is the total time it takes to get the

2500
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:54,880
is the total time it takes to get the
 

2501
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:55,990
is the total time it takes to get the
project done

2502
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:56,000
project done
 

2503
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,190
project done
and most of that's going to be the

2504
00:42:57,190 --> 00:42:57,200
and most of that's going to be the
 

2505
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,510
and most of that's going to be the
programmer time so if you're a little

2506
00:42:59,510 --> 00:42:59,520
programmer time so if you're a little
 

2507
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,190
programmer time so if you're a little
bit less efficient but it makes it

2508
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:01,200
bit less efficient but it makes it
 

2509
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,550
bit less efficient but it makes it
easier to

2510
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:02,560
easier to
 

2511
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,630
easier to
understand and modify then that's the

2512
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:04,640
understand and modify then that's the
 

2513
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,750
understand and modify then that's the
right trade-off

2514
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:05,760
right trade-off
 

2515
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,510
right trade-off
so you've written quite a bit about lisp

2516
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:07,520
so you've written quite a bit about lisp
 

2517
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,430
so you've written quite a bit about lisp
your book on programming is in lisp

2518
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:09,440
your book on programming is in lisp
 

2519
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,589
your book on programming is in lisp
you you have a lot of code out there

2520
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:11,599
you you have a lot of code out there
 

2521
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:12,790
you you have a lot of code out there
that's in lisp

2522
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:12,800
that's in lisp
 

2523
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,309
that's in lisp
so myself and people who don't know what

2524
00:43:16,309 --> 00:43:16,319
so myself and people who don't know what
 

2525
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:17,910
so myself and people who don't know what
lisp is should look it up

2526
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:17,920
lisp is should look it up
 

2527
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,910
lisp is should look it up
it's my favorite language for many ai

2528
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:19,920
it's my favorite language for many ai
 

2529
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,309
it's my favorite language for many ai
researchers it is a favorite language

2530
00:43:22,309 --> 00:43:22,319
researchers it is a favorite language
 

2531
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:24,309
researchers it is a favorite language
the favorite language they never use

2532
00:43:24,309 --> 00:43:24,319
the favorite language they never use
 

2533
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:25,349
the favorite language they never use
these days

2534
00:43:25,349 --> 00:43:25,359
these days
 

2535
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:26,870
these days
so what part of the list do you find

2536
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:26,880
so what part of the list do you find
 

2537
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,870
so what part of the list do you find
most beautiful and powerful

2538
00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:28,880
most beautiful and powerful
 

2539
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,870
most beautiful and powerful
so i think the beautiful part is the

2540
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:30,880
so i think the beautiful part is the
 

2541
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,630
so i think the beautiful part is the
simplicity that in

2542
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:32,640
simplicity that in
 

2543
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,550
simplicity that in
half a page you can define the whole

2544
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:34,560
half a page you can define the whole
 

2545
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,309
half a page you can define the whole
language

2546
00:43:36,309 --> 00:43:36,319
language
 

2547
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:38,470
language
and other languages don't have that so

2548
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:38,480
and other languages don't have that so
 

2549
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,470
and other languages don't have that so
you feel like you can hold everything

2550
00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:40,480
you feel like you can hold everything
 

2551
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:45,750
you feel like you can hold everything
in your head and

2552
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:45,760

 

2553
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,270

then you know a lot of people say well

2554
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:47,280
then you know a lot of people say well
 

2555
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,030
then you know a lot of people say well
then that's too simple you know here's

2556
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:49,040
then that's too simple you know here's
 

2557
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,390
then that's too simple you know here's
all these things i want to do

2558
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:50,400
all these things i want to do
 

2559
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:53,829
all these things i want to do
and you know my java or python or

2560
00:43:53,829 --> 00:43:53,839
and you know my java or python or
 

2561
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:54,470
and you know my java or python or
whatever

2562
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:54,480
whatever
 

2563
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,230
whatever
has 100 or 200 or 300 different syntax

2564
00:43:58,230 --> 00:43:58,240
has 100 or 200 or 300 different syntax
 

2565
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,309
has 100 or 200 or 300 different syntax
rules and don't i need all those

2566
00:44:00,309 --> 00:44:00,319
rules and don't i need all those
 

2567
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:02,550
rules and don't i need all those
and lisp's answer was no we're only

2568
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:02,560
and lisp's answer was no we're only
 

2569
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:03,750
and lisp's answer was no we're only
going to give you

2570
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:03,760
going to give you
 

2571
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,230
going to give you
eight or so syntax rules but we're going

2572
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:06,240
eight or so syntax rules but we're going
 

2573
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,870
eight or so syntax rules but we're going
to allow you to define your own

2574
00:44:08,870 --> 00:44:08,880
to allow you to define your own
 

2575
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,990
to allow you to define your own
and so that was a very powerful idea and

2576
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:12,000
and so that was a very powerful idea and
 

2577
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,750
and so that was a very powerful idea and
i think this idea of saying

2578
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:15,760
i think this idea of saying
 

2579
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:19,109
i think this idea of saying
i can start with my problem and with my

2580
00:44:19,109 --> 00:44:19,119
i can start with my problem and with my
 

2581
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:20,309
i can start with my problem and with my
data

2582
00:44:20,309 --> 00:44:20,319
data
 

2583
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:22,950
data
and then i can build the language i want

2584
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:22,960
and then i can build the language i want
 

2585
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:23,430
and then i can build the language i want
uh

2586
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:23,440
uh
 

2587
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,910
uh
for that problem and for that data and

2588
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:25,920
for that problem and for that data and
 

2589
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,510
for that problem and for that data and
then i can make lists define that

2590
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:27,520
then i can make lists define that
 

2591
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,390
then i can make lists define that
language

2592
00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:28,400
language
 

2593
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,589
language
so you uh you're sort of uh mixing

2594
00:44:31,589 --> 00:44:31,599
so you uh you're sort of uh mixing
 

2595
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:34,230
so you uh you're sort of uh mixing
levels and saying i'm simultaneously

2596
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:34,240
levels and saying i'm simultaneously
 

2597
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,230
levels and saying i'm simultaneously
a programmer in a language and a

2598
00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:36,240
a programmer in a language and a
 

2599
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,550
a programmer in a language and a
language designer

2600
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:38,560
language designer
 

2601
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,870
language designer
and that allows a better match between

2602
00:44:40,870 --> 00:44:40,880
and that allows a better match between
 

2603
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:41,829
and that allows a better match between
your problem

2604
00:44:41,829 --> 00:44:41,839
your problem
 

2605
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:44,870
your problem
and your eventual code and i think lis

2606
00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:44,880
and your eventual code and i think lis
 

2607
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,550
and your eventual code and i think lis
had done that better than other

2608
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:46,560
had done that better than other
 

2609
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,710
had done that better than other
languages yeah it's a very elegant

2610
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:48,720
languages yeah it's a very elegant
 

2611
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:51,190
languages yeah it's a very elegant
implementation of functional programming

2612
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:51,200
implementation of functional programming
 

2613
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:54,230
implementation of functional programming
but why do you think lisp has not had

2614
00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:54,240
but why do you think lisp has not had
 

2615
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,910
but why do you think lisp has not had
the mass adoption and success of

2616
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:55,920
the mass adoption and success of
 

2617
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,109
the mass adoption and success of
languages like python

2618
00:44:57,109 --> 00:44:57,119
languages like python
 

2619
00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:59,670
languages like python
is it the parentheses is it all the

2620
00:44:59,670 --> 00:44:59,680
is it the parentheses is it all the
 

2621
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:01,990
is it the parentheses is it all the
parentheses

2622
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:02,000
parentheses
 

2623
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,270
parentheses
yeah so i think a couple of things

2624
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:05,280
yeah so i think a couple of things
 

2625
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:08,550
yeah so i think a couple of things
so one was i think it was designed

2626
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:08,560
so one was i think it was designed
 

2627
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:12,470
so one was i think it was designed
for a single programmer or a small team

2628
00:45:12,470 --> 00:45:12,480
for a single programmer or a small team
 

2629
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,589
for a single programmer or a small team
and a skilled programmer who

2630
00:45:15,589 --> 00:45:15,599
and a skilled programmer who
 

2631
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:17,990
and a skilled programmer who
had the good taste to say well i'm i am

2632
00:45:17,990 --> 00:45:18,000
had the good taste to say well i'm i am
 

2633
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,510
had the good taste to say well i'm i am
doing language design

2634
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:19,520
doing language design
 

2635
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,829
doing language design
and i have to make good choices and if

2636
00:45:21,829 --> 00:45:21,839
and i have to make good choices and if
 

2637
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:22,790
and i have to make good choices and if
you make good choices

2638
00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:22,800
you make good choices
 

2639
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:26,470
you make good choices
that's great if you make bad choices

2640
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:26,480
that's great if you make bad choices
 

2641
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:29,109
that's great if you make bad choices
you can hurt yourself and it can be hard

2642
00:45:29,109 --> 00:45:29,119
you can hurt yourself and it can be hard
 

2643
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:30,309
you can hurt yourself and it can be hard
for other people on the team to

2644
00:45:30,309 --> 00:45:30,319
for other people on the team to
 

2645
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:30,950
for other people on the team to
understand it

2646
00:45:30,950 --> 00:45:30,960
understand it
 

2647
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,510
understand it
so i think there was a limit to the

2648
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:33,520
so i think there was a limit to the
 

2649
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:34,150
so i think there was a limit to the
scale

2650
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:34,160
scale
 

2651
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,990
scale
of the size of a project in terms of

2652
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:36,000
of the size of a project in terms of
 

2653
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,550
of the size of a project in terms of
number of people that lisp was good for

2654
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:38,560
number of people that lisp was good for
 

2655
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:41,270
number of people that lisp was good for
and as an industry we kind of grew

2656
00:45:41,270 --> 00:45:41,280
and as an industry we kind of grew
 

2657
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,109
and as an industry we kind of grew
beyond that

2658
00:45:43,109 --> 00:45:43,119
beyond that
 

2659
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:46,710
beyond that
i think it is in part the parentheses

2660
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:46,720
i think it is in part the parentheses
 

2661
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,870
i think it is in part the parentheses
you know one of the jokes is the acronym

2662
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:48,880
you know one of the jokes is the acronym
 

2663
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,150
you know one of the jokes is the acronym
for lisp is

2664
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:50,160
for lisp is
 

2665
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:53,910
for lisp is
lots of irritating silly parentheses

2666
00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:53,920
lots of irritating silly parentheses
 

2667
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,550
lots of irritating silly parentheses
my acronym was lisp is syntactically

2668
00:45:56,550 --> 00:45:56,560
my acronym was lisp is syntactically
 

2669
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,309
my acronym was lisp is syntactically
pure

2670
00:45:58,309 --> 00:45:58,319
pure
 

2671
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:00,390
pure
saying all you need is parentheses and

2672
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:00,400
saying all you need is parentheses and
 

2673
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,790
saying all you need is parentheses and
atoms but i remember

2674
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:02,800
atoms but i remember
 

2675
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,190
atoms but i remember
you know so we had the the ai textbook

2676
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:05,200
you know so we had the the ai textbook
 

2677
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:05,829
you know so we had the the ai textbook
and

2678
00:46:05,829 --> 00:46:05,839
and
 

2679
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:09,670
and
uh because we did it in the 90s we had

2680
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:09,680
uh because we did it in the 90s we had
 

2681
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,670
uh because we did it in the 90s we had
we had pseudocode in the book but then

2682
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:11,680
we had pseudocode in the book but then
 

2683
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,190
we had pseudocode in the book but then
we said well we'll have lisp online

2684
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:13,200
we said well we'll have lisp online
 

2685
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:13,990
we said well we'll have lisp online
because that's the language

2686
00:46:13,990 --> 00:46:14,000
because that's the language
 

2687
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,030
because that's the language
of ai at the time and i remember some of

2688
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:17,040
of ai at the time and i remember some of
 

2689
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,150
of ai at the time and i remember some of
the students complaining

2690
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:18,160
the students complaining
 

2691
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,150
the students complaining
because they hadn't had lists before and

2692
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:20,160
because they hadn't had lists before and
 

2693
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,349
because they hadn't had lists before and
they didn't quite understand what was

2694
00:46:21,349 --> 00:46:21,359
they didn't quite understand what was
 

2695
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:22,550
they didn't quite understand what was
going on and

2696
00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:22,560
going on and
 

2697
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,790
going on and
i remember one student complained i

2698
00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:24,800
i remember one student complained i
 

2699
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,550
i remember one student complained i
don't understand how this pseudocode

2700
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:26,560
don't understand how this pseudocode
 

2701
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:29,829
don't understand how this pseudocode
corresponds to this lisp and there was a

2702
00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:29,839
corresponds to this lisp and there was a
 

2703
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:31,430
corresponds to this lisp and there was a
one-to-one correspondence

2704
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:31,440
one-to-one correspondence
 

2705
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:35,030
one-to-one correspondence
between the the symbols in the code in

2706
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:35,040
between the the symbols in the code in
 

2707
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,069
between the the symbols in the code in
the pseudocode and the only thing

2708
00:46:36,069 --> 00:46:36,079
the pseudocode and the only thing
 

2709
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:39,030
the pseudocode and the only thing
difference was the parentheses

2710
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:39,040
difference was the parentheses
 

2711
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,710
difference was the parentheses
so i said it must be that for some

2712
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:40,720
so i said it must be that for some
 

2713
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:41,910
so i said it must be that for some
people a certain number of left

2714
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:41,920
people a certain number of left
 

2715
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:45,030
people a certain number of left
parentheses shuts off their brain

2716
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:45,040
parentheses shuts off their brain
 

2717
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,630
parentheses shuts off their brain
yeah it's very it's very possible in

2718
00:46:46,630 --> 00:46:46,640
yeah it's very it's very possible in
 

2719
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,390
yeah it's very it's very possible in
that sense then python just goes the

2720
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:48,400
that sense then python just goes the
 

2721
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:48,950
that sense then python just goes the
other way

2722
00:46:48,950 --> 00:46:48,960
other way
 

2723
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,710
other way
and so so that was the point at which i

2724
00:46:50,710 --> 00:46:50,720
and so so that was the point at which i
 

2725
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:53,270
and so so that was the point at which i
said okay can't have only lisp that's a

2726
00:46:53,270 --> 00:46:53,280
said okay can't have only lisp that's a
 

2727
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,150
said okay can't have only lisp that's a
language

2728
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:54,160
language
 

2729
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,309
language
because i you know i don't want to you

2730
00:46:56,309 --> 00:46:56,319
because i you know i don't want to you
 

2731
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:58,390
because i you know i don't want to you
know you only got 10 or 12 or 15 weeks

2732
00:46:58,390 --> 00:46:58,400
know you only got 10 or 12 or 15 weeks
 

2733
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,990
know you only got 10 or 12 or 15 weeks
or whatever it is to teach ai and i

2734
00:46:59,990 --> 00:47:00,000
or whatever it is to teach ai and i
 

2735
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:00,470
or whatever it is to teach ai and i
don't want

2736
00:47:00,470 --> 00:47:00,480
don't want
 

2737
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,790
don't want
to waste two weeks of that teaching lisp

2738
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:02,800
to waste two weeks of that teaching lisp
 

2739
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,309
to waste two weeks of that teaching lisp
so i say i got to have another language

2740
00:47:04,309 --> 00:47:04,319
so i say i got to have another language
 

2741
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:06,150
so i say i got to have another language
java was the most popular language at

2742
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:06,160
java was the most popular language at
 

2743
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:06,790
java was the most popular language at
the time

2744
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:06,800
the time
 

2745
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,950
the time
i started doing that and then i said

2746
00:47:08,950 --> 00:47:08,960
i started doing that and then i said
 

2747
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,870
i started doing that and then i said
it's really hard to

2748
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:10,880
it's really hard to
 

2749
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,790
it's really hard to
have a one-to-one correspondence between

2750
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:12,800
have a one-to-one correspondence between
 

2751
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,550
have a one-to-one correspondence between
the pseudocode and the java because

2752
00:47:14,550 --> 00:47:14,560
the pseudocode and the java because
 

2753
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,790
the pseudocode and the java because
java's so verbose

2754
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:16,800
java's so verbose
 

2755
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,790
java's so verbose
so then i said i'm going to do a survey

2756
00:47:18,790 --> 00:47:18,800
so then i said i'm going to do a survey
 

2757
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,190
so then i said i'm going to do a survey
and find the language that's most like

2758
00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:21,200
and find the language that's most like
 

2759
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,750
and find the language that's most like
my pseudocode and turned out python

2760
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:23,760
my pseudocode and turned out python
 

2761
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:24,710
my pseudocode and turned out python
basically was

2762
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:24,720
basically was
 

2763
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:28,150
basically was
my pseudo code somehow i had channeled

2764
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:28,160
my pseudo code somehow i had channeled
 

2765
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:31,510
my pseudo code somehow i had channeled
uh guido and designed a pseudocode that

2766
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:31,520
uh guido and designed a pseudocode that
 

2767
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:32,950
uh guido and designed a pseudocode that
was the same as python although i hadn't

2768
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:32,960
was the same as python although i hadn't
 

2769
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,150
was the same as python although i hadn't
heard of python

2770
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:34,160
heard of python
 

2771
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:37,270
heard of python
uh at that point and from then on uh

2772
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:37,280
uh at that point and from then on uh
 

2773
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,470
uh at that point and from then on uh
that's what i've been using because it's

2774
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:38,480
that's what i've been using because it's
 

2775
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,190
that's what i've been using because it's
been a good match

2776
00:47:41,190 --> 00:47:41,200

 

2777
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,549

so what's the story in python behind

2778
00:47:44,549 --> 00:47:44,559
so what's the story in python behind
 

2779
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:47,030
so what's the story in python behind
pietudes your github repository with

2780
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:47,040
pietudes your github repository with
 

2781
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,950
pietudes your github repository with
puzzles and exercises and python is

2782
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:48,960
puzzles and exercises and python is
 

2783
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:49,589
puzzles and exercises and python is
pretty fun

2784
00:47:49,589 --> 00:47:49,599
pretty fun
 

2785
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:52,549
pretty fun
yeah just it seems like fun uh you know

uh doing puzzles and i like uh being an
educator

2792
00:47:57,349 --> 00:47:57,359
educator
 

2793
00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:00,549
educator
i did a class with udacity uh udacity

2794
00:48:00,549 --> 00:48:00,559
i did a class with udacity uh udacity
 

2795
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:03,829
i did a class with udacity uh udacity
uh 212 i think it was it was basically

2796
00:48:03,829 --> 00:48:03,839
uh 212 i think it was it was basically
 

2797
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:07,190
uh 212 i think it was it was basically
problem solving uh using python

2798
00:48:07,190 --> 00:48:07,200
problem solving uh using python
 

2799
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,030
problem solving uh using python
and looking at different problems does

2800
00:48:09,030 --> 00:48:09,040
and looking at different problems does
 

2801
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,710
and looking at different problems does
pie tubes feed that class

2802
00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:10,720
pie tubes feed that class
 

2803
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:11,990
pie tubes feed that class
in terms of the exercises i was

2804
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:12,000
in terms of the exercises i was
 

2805
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,349
in terms of the exercises i was
wondering what that yeah so the class

2806
00:48:13,349 --> 00:48:13,359
wondering what that yeah so the class
 

2807
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:14,470
wondering what that yeah so the class
the class came first

2808
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:14,480
the class came first
 

2809
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,230
the class came first
yeah some of the stuff that's in pi

2810
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:16,240
yeah some of the stuff that's in pi
 

2811
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,150
yeah some of the stuff that's in pi
tubes was write-ups of what was in the

2812
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:18,160
tubes was write-ups of what was in the
 

2813
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:19,430
tubes was write-ups of what was in the
class and then some of it was just

2814
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:19,440
class and then some of it was just
 

2815
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:20,630
class and then some of it was just
continuing to

2816
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:20,640
continuing to
 

2817
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:24,069
continuing to
uh to work on new problems

2818
00:48:24,069 --> 00:48:24,079
uh to work on new problems
 

2819
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:26,150
uh to work on new problems
so what's the organizing madness of pi

2820
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:26,160
so what's the organizing madness of pi
 

2821
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,750
so what's the organizing madness of pi
tubes is it just the

2822
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:27,760
tubes is it just the
 

2823
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:29,990
tubes is it just the
collect a collection of cool exercises

2824
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:30,000
collect a collection of cool exercises
 

2825
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,589
collect a collection of cool exercises
just whatever i thought was fun okay

2826
00:48:31,589 --> 00:48:31,599
just whatever i thought was fun okay
 

2827
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:32,870
just whatever i thought was fun okay
awesome

00:48:32,870 --> 00:48:32,880
awesome
 

2829
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,950
awesome
so you were the director of search

2830
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:34,960
so you were the director of search
 

2831
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,309
so you were the director of search
quality of google from

2832
00:48:36,309 --> 00:48:36,319
quality of google from
 

2833
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:40,069
quality of google from
2001 to 2005. in the early days

2834
00:48:40,069 --> 00:48:40,079
2001 to 2005. in the early days
 

2835
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:42,950
2001 to 2005. in the early days
uh when there's just a few employees and

2836
00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:42,960
uh when there's just a few employees and
 

2837
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,790
uh when there's just a few employees and
when the company was growing

2838
00:48:44,790 --> 00:48:44,800
when the company was growing
 

2839
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:48,710
when the company was growing
like crazy right so

2840
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:48,720
like crazy right so
 

2841
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,549
like crazy right so
i mean a google revolution has the way

2842
00:48:50,549 --> 00:48:50,559
i mean a google revolution has the way
 

2843
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:52,069
i mean a google revolution has the way
we discover

2844
00:48:52,069 --> 00:48:52,079
we discover
 

2845
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:55,190
we discover
share and aggregate knowledge

2846
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:55,200
share and aggregate knowledge
 

2847
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:58,470
share and aggregate knowledge
so just this is uh this is one of the

2848
00:48:58,470 --> 00:48:58,480
so just this is uh this is one of the
 

2849
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:01,109
so just this is uh this is one of the
fundamental aspects of civilization

2850
00:49:01,109 --> 00:49:01,119
fundamental aspects of civilization
 

2851
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:02,390
fundamental aspects of civilization
right is information

2852
00:49:02,390 --> 00:49:02,400
right is information
 

2853
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,750
right is information
being shared and there's different

2854
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:03,760
being shared and there's different
 

2855
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,270
being shared and there's different
mechanisms throughout history but google

2856
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:05,280
mechanisms throughout history but google
 

2857
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:06,309
mechanisms throughout history but google
is just

2858
00:49:06,309 --> 00:49:06,319
is just
 

2859
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:09,190
is just
10x improved that right and you're a

2860
00:49:09,190 --> 00:49:09,200
10x improved that right and you're a
 

2861
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:09,910
10x improved that right and you're a
part of that

2862
00:49:09,910 --> 00:49:09,920
part of that
 

2863
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,270
part of that
right people discovering that

2864
00:49:11,270 --> 00:49:11,280
right people discovering that
 

2865
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:12,870
right people discovering that
information so what were some of the

2866
00:49:12,870 --> 00:49:12,880
information so what were some of the
 

2867
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:13,990
information so what were some of the
challenges

2868
00:49:13,990 --> 00:49:14,000
challenges
 

2869
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,910
challenges
on the philosophical or the technical

2870
00:49:15,910 --> 00:49:15,920
on the philosophical or the technical
 

2871
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:18,230
on the philosophical or the technical
level in those early days

2872
00:49:18,230 --> 00:49:18,240
level in those early days
 

2873
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,230
level in those early days
it definitely was an exciting time and

2874
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:20,240
it definitely was an exciting time and
 

2875
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:21,270
it definitely was an exciting time and
as you say we were

2876
00:49:21,270 --> 00:49:21,280
as you say we were
 

2877
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:24,470
as you say we were
doubling in size every year

2878
00:49:24,470 --> 00:49:24,480
doubling in size every year
 

2879
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,950
doubling in size every year
and the challenges were we wanted to get

2880
00:49:26,950 --> 00:49:26,960
and the challenges were we wanted to get
 

2881
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,069
and the challenges were we wanted to get
the right answers

2882
00:49:28,069 --> 00:49:28,079
the right answers
 

2883
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:31,270
the right answers
right and uh we had to figure out

2884
00:49:31,270 --> 00:49:31,280
right and uh we had to figure out
 

2885
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,670
right and uh we had to figure out
what that meant we had to implement that

2886
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:33,680
what that meant we had to implement that
 

2887
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,030
what that meant we had to implement that
and we had to make it all

2888
00:49:35,030 --> 00:49:35,040
and we had to make it all
 

2889
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:39,750
and we had to make it all
uh efficient and uh

2890
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:39,760

 

2891
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:42,309

we had to keep on testing and seeing if

2892
00:49:42,309 --> 00:49:42,319
we had to keep on testing and seeing if
 

2893
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:43,990
we had to keep on testing and seeing if
we were delivering good answers

2894
00:49:43,990 --> 00:49:44,000
we were delivering good answers
 

2895
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,670
we were delivering good answers
and now when you say good answers it

2896
00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:45,680
and now when you say good answers it
 

2897
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,750
and now when you say good answers it
means whatever people are typing in in

2898
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:47,760
means whatever people are typing in in
 

2899
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,270
means whatever people are typing in in
terms of keywords in terms

2900
00:49:49,270 --> 00:49:49,280
terms of keywords in terms
 

2901
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:52,549
terms of keywords in terms
that kind of thing that the the results

2902
00:49:52,549 --> 00:49:52,559
that kind of thing that the the results
 

2903
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:54,950
that kind of thing that the the results
they get are ordered by the desirability

2904
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:54,960
they get are ordered by the desirability
 

2905
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:55,510
they get are ordered by the desirability
for them

2906
00:49:55,510 --> 00:49:55,520
for them
 

2907
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,349
for them
of those results like they're like the

2908
00:49:57,349 --> 00:49:57,359
of those results like they're like the
 

2909
00:49:57,359 --> 00:49:59,109
of those results like they're like the
first thing they click on will likely be

2910
00:49:59,109 --> 00:49:59,119
first thing they click on will likely be
 

2911
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:00,230
first thing they click on will likely be
the thing that they were

2912
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:00,240
the thing that they were
 

2913
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,309
the thing that they were
actually looking for right one of the

2914
00:50:02,309 --> 00:50:02,319
actually looking for right one of the
 

2915
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:04,069
actually looking for right one of the
metrics we had was focused on the first

2916
00:50:04,069 --> 00:50:04,079
metrics we had was focused on the first
 

2917
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:04,630
metrics we had was focused on the first
thing

2918
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:04,640
thing
 

2919
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,950
thing
uh some of it was focused on the whole

2920
00:50:06,950 --> 00:50:06,960
uh some of it was focused on the whole
 

2921
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,870
uh some of it was focused on the whole
page so it was focused on

2922
00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:08,880
page so it was focused on
 

2923
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:12,150
page so it was focused on
you know top three or so so we looked at

2924
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:12,160
you know top three or so so we looked at
 

2925
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,829
you know top three or so so we looked at
a lot of different metrics for

2926
00:50:13,829 --> 00:50:13,839
a lot of different metrics for
 

2927
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:16,309
a lot of different metrics for
for how well we were doing and we broke

2928
00:50:16,309 --> 00:50:16,319
for how well we were doing and we broke
 

2929
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:17,349
for how well we were doing and we broke
it down into

2930
00:50:17,349 --> 00:50:17,359
it down into
 

2931
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:19,670
it down into
subclasses of you know maybe here's a

2932
00:50:19,670 --> 00:50:19,680
subclasses of you know maybe here's a
 

2933
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,109
subclasses of you know maybe here's a
type of uh

2934
00:50:21,109 --> 00:50:21,119
type of uh
 

2935
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:23,349
type of uh
of uh query that we're not doing well on

2936
00:50:23,349 --> 00:50:23,359
of uh query that we're not doing well on
 

2937
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:25,430
of uh query that we're not doing well on
then we try to fix that

2938
00:50:25,430 --> 00:50:25,440
then we try to fix that
 

2939
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,990
then we try to fix that
early on we started to realize that we

2940
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:28,000
early on we started to realize that we
 

2941
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,349
early on we started to realize that we
were in an adversarial

2942
00:50:29,349 --> 00:50:29,359
were in an adversarial
 

2943
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:32,549
were in an adversarial
position right so we started thinking uh

2944
00:50:32,549 --> 00:50:32,559
position right so we started thinking uh
 

2945
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:33,510
position right so we started thinking uh
well we're kind of like

2946
00:50:33,510 --> 00:50:33,520
well we're kind of like
 

2947
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:36,470
well we're kind of like
the card catalog in the library right so

2948
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:36,480
the card catalog in the library right so
 

2949
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:38,230
the card catalog in the library right so
the books are here and we're off to the

2950
00:50:38,230 --> 00:50:38,240
the books are here and we're off to the
 

2951
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,510
the books are here and we're off to the
side

2952
00:50:39,510 --> 00:50:39,520
side
 

2953
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:42,549
side
and we're just reflecting what's there

2954
00:50:42,549 --> 00:50:42,559
and we're just reflecting what's there
 

2955
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:44,710
and we're just reflecting what's there
and then we realized every time we make

2956
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:44,720
and then we realized every time we make
 

2957
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:47,910
and then we realized every time we make
a change the webmasters make a change

2958
00:50:47,910 --> 00:50:47,920
a change the webmasters make a change
 

2959
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:50,549
a change the webmasters make a change
and it's uh game theoretic and so we had

2960
00:50:50,549 --> 00:50:50,559
and it's uh game theoretic and so we had
 

2961
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:52,150
and it's uh game theoretic and so we had
to think not only of

2962
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:52,160
to think not only of
 

2963
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:55,030
to think not only of
is this the right move for us to make

2964
00:50:55,030 --> 00:50:55,040
is this the right move for us to make
 

2965
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:55,430
is this the right move for us to make
now

2966
00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:55,440
now
 

2967
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:57,990
now
but also if we make this move what's the

2968
00:50:57,990 --> 00:50:58,000
but also if we make this move what's the
 

2969
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,670
but also if we make this move what's the
counter move going to be

2970
00:50:59,670 --> 00:50:59,680
counter move going to be
 

2971
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,190
counter move going to be
is that going to get us into a work

2972
00:51:01,190 --> 00:51:01,200
is that going to get us into a work
 

2973
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,190
is that going to get us into a work
worst place in which case we won't make

2974
00:51:03,190 --> 00:51:03,200
worst place in which case we won't make
 

2975
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,349
worst place in which case we won't make
that move we'll make a different move

2976
00:51:05,349 --> 00:51:05,359
that move we'll make a different move
 

2977
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:07,349
that move we'll make a different move
and did you find i mean i assume with

2978
00:51:07,349 --> 00:51:07,359
and did you find i mean i assume with
 

2979
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:08,870
and did you find i mean i assume with
the popularity and the growth of the

2980
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:08,880
the popularity and the growth of the
 

2981
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,630
the popularity and the growth of the
internet that people were creating new

2982
00:51:10,630 --> 00:51:10,640
internet that people were creating new
 

2983
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:11,430
internet that people were creating new
content

2984
00:51:11,430 --> 00:51:11,440
content
 

2985
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,589
content
so you're almost helping guide the

2986
00:51:13,589 --> 00:51:13,599
so you're almost helping guide the
 

2987
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:15,430
so you're almost helping guide the
creation yeah so that's certainly true

2988
00:51:15,430 --> 00:51:15,440
creation yeah so that's certainly true
 

2989
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:16,150
creation yeah so that's certainly true
right so

2990
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:16,160
right so
 

2991
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:19,349
right so
we we definitely changed uh the

2992
00:51:19,349 --> 00:51:19,359
we we definitely changed uh the
 

2993
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:20,150
we we definitely changed uh the
structure

2994
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:20,160
structure
 

2995
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,589
structure
of the network right so if you think

2996
00:51:21,589 --> 00:51:21,599
of the network right so if you think
 

2997
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:23,670
of the network right so if you think
back you know in the in the very early

2998
00:51:23,670 --> 00:51:23,680
back you know in the in the very early
 

2999
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:24,309
back you know in the in the very early
days

3000
00:51:24,309 --> 00:51:24,319
days
 

3001
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:27,190
days
uh larry and sergey had the page rank

3002
00:51:27,190 --> 00:51:27,200
uh larry and sergey had the page rank
 

3003
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:28,309
uh larry and sergey had the page rank

00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:31,190
paper
and john kleinberg had this uh hubsan

3006
00:51:31,190 --> 00:51:31,200
and john kleinberg had this uh hubsan
 

3007

model which says the web is made out of
 

3011
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:40,230
model which says the web is made out of
these uh hubs which will be

3012
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:40,240
these uh hubs which will be
 

3013
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:43,750
these uh hubs which will be
my page of cool links about dogs or

3014
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:43,760
my page of cool links about dogs or
 

3015
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:44,309
my page of cool links about dogs or
whatever

3016
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:44,319
whatever
 

3017
00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:46,870
whatever
and people would just list links uh and

3018
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:46,880
and people would just list links uh and
 

3019
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,390
and people would just list links uh and
then there'd be authorities which were

3020
00:51:48,390 --> 00:51:48,400
then there'd be authorities which were
 

3021
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:49,990
then there'd be authorities which were
the ones uh the

3022
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:50,000
the ones uh the
 

3023
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,950
the ones uh the
page about dogs that most people link to

3024
00:51:52,950 --> 00:51:52,960
page about dogs that most people link to
 

3025
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:54,150
page about dogs that most people link to
that doesn't happen anymore

3026
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:54,160
that doesn't happen anymore
 

3027
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:56,230
that doesn't happen anymore
people don't bother to say my page of

3028
00:51:56,230 --> 00:51:56,240
people don't bother to say my page of
 

3029
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:57,670
people don't bother to say my page of
cool links

3030
00:51:57,670 --> 00:51:57,680
cool links
 

3031
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,589
cool links
because we took over that function right

3032
00:51:59,589 --> 00:51:59,599
because we took over that function right
 

3033
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:00,710
because we took over that function right
so so

3034
00:52:00,710 --> 00:52:00,720
so so
 

3035
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:03,910
so so
we changed the way that worked did you

3036
00:52:03,910 --> 00:52:03,920
we changed the way that worked did you
 

3037
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,589
we changed the way that worked did you
imagine back then that the internet

3038
00:52:05,589 --> 00:52:05,599
imagine back then that the internet
 

3039
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:07,750
imagine back then that the internet
would be as massively vibrant as it is

3040
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:07,760
would be as massively vibrant as it is
 

3041
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:08,710
would be as massively vibrant as it is
today

3042
00:52:08,710 --> 00:52:08,720
today
 

3043
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,230
today
i mean it was already growing quickly

3044
00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:10,240
i mean it was already growing quickly
 

3045
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:12,630
i mean it was already growing quickly
but it's just another

3046
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:12,640
but it's just another
 

3047
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:15,270
but it's just another
i i don't know if you've ever if today

3048
00:52:15,270 --> 00:52:15,280
i i don't know if you've ever if today
 

3049
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:16,950
i i don't know if you've ever if today
if you sit back and just look at the

3050
00:52:16,950 --> 00:52:16,960
if you sit back and just look at the
 

3051
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:17,990
if you sit back and just look at the
internet

3052
00:52:17,990 --> 00:52:18,000
internet
 

3053
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,630
internet
with wander the amount of content that's

3054
00:52:20,630 --> 00:52:20,640
with wander the amount of content that's
 

3055
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,309
with wander the amount of content that's
just constantly being created constantly

3056
00:52:22,309 --> 00:52:22,319
just constantly being created constantly
 

3057
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:23,030
just constantly being created constantly
being shared

3058
00:52:23,030 --> 00:52:23,040

unemployed yeah it's uh it's always been

3060
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:26,240
unemployed yeah it's uh it's always been
 

3061
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,270
unemployed yeah it's uh it's always been
surprising to me

3062
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:27,280
surprising to me
 

3063
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,270
surprising to me
i guess i'm not very good at predicting

3064
00:52:29,270 --> 00:52:29,280
i guess i'm not very good at predicting
 

3065
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:30,390
i guess i'm not very good at predicting
the future in the future

3066
00:52:30,390 --> 00:52:30,400
the future in the future
 

3067
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:33,030
the future in the future
okay and i remember you know being a

3068
00:52:33,030 --> 00:52:33,040
okay and i remember you know being a
 

3069
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:34,150
okay and i remember you know being a
graduate student in

3070
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:34,160
graduate student in
 

3071
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:37,750
graduate student in
in 1980 or so and uh you know we had the

3072
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:37,760
in 1980 or so and uh you know we had the
 

3073
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:39,430
in 1980 or so and uh you know we had the
arpanet

3074
00:52:39,430 --> 00:52:39,440
arpanet
 

3075
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:42,790
arpanet
and then there was this uh proposal to

3076
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:42,800
and then there was this uh proposal to
 

3077
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,950
and then there was this uh proposal to
uh commercialize it and have this

3078
00:52:44,950 --> 00:52:44,960
uh commercialize it and have this
 

3079
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:46,470
uh commercialize it and have this
internet and this uh

3080
00:52:46,470 --> 00:52:46,480
internet and this uh
 

3081
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:49,910
internet and this uh
uh crazy senator gore thought that might

3082
00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:49,920
uh crazy senator gore thought that might
 

3083
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,750
uh crazy senator gore thought that might
be a good idea yeah and i remember

3084
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:51,760
be a good idea yeah and i remember
 

3085
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:53,510
be a good idea yeah and i remember
thinking oh come on you can't

3086
00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:53,520
thinking oh come on you can't
 

3087
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,829
thinking oh come on you can't
you can't expect a commercial company to

3088
00:52:55,829 --> 00:52:55,839
you can't expect a commercial company to
 

3089
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:56,630
you can't expect a commercial company to
understand

3090
00:52:56,630 --> 00:52:56,640
understand
 

3091
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,950
understand
this technology they'll never be able to

3092
00:52:58,950 --> 00:52:58,960
this technology they'll never be able to
 

3093
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,870
this technology they'll never be able to
do it yeah okay we can have this dot-com

3094
00:53:00,870 --> 00:53:00,880
do it yeah okay we can have this dot-com
 

3095
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:03,270
do it yeah okay we can have this dot-com
domain but it won't go anywhere

3096
00:53:03,270 --> 00:53:03,280
domain but it won't go anywhere
 

3097
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,670
domain but it won't go anywhere
so i was wrong al gore was right at the

3098
00:53:05,670 --> 00:53:05,680
so i was wrong al gore was right at the
 

3099
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:06,630
so i was wrong al gore was right at the
same time

3100
00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:06,640
same time
 

3101
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,150
same time
the nature of what it means to be a

3102
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:08,160
the nature of what it means to be a
 

3103
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:09,750
the nature of what it means to be a
commercial company has changed too

3104
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:09,760
commercial company has changed too
 

3105
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:12,630
commercial company has changed too
so google yeah isn't that it's founding

3106
00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:12,640
so google yeah isn't that it's founding
 

3107
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,390
so google yeah isn't that it's founding
is different than uh

3108
00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:14,400
is different than uh
 

3109
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,390
is different than uh
you know what companies were before i

3110
00:53:16,390 --> 00:53:16,400
you know what companies were before i
 

3111
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,309
you know what companies were before i
think right so there's all these

3112
00:53:18,309 --> 00:53:18,319
think right so there's all these
 

3113
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:20,630
think right so there's all these
uh business models that are so different

3114
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:20,640
uh business models that are so different
 

3115
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,870
uh business models that are so different
than what was possible back then

3116
00:53:22,870 --> 00:53:22,880
than what was possible back then
 

3117
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:24,790
than what was possible back then
so in terms of predicting the future

3118
00:53:24,790 --> 00:53:24,800
so in terms of predicting the future
 

3119
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,309
so in terms of predicting the future
what do you think it takes to build a

3120
00:53:26,309 --> 00:53:26,319
what do you think it takes to build a
 

3121
00:53:26,319 --> 00:53:27,190
what do you think it takes to build a
system

3122
00:53:27,190 --> 00:53:27,200
system
 

3123
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:30,069
system
that approaches human level intelligence

3124
00:53:30,069 --> 00:53:30,079
that approaches human level intelligence
 

3125
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:31,190
that approaches human level intelligence
you've talked about

3126
00:53:31,190 --> 00:53:31,200
you've talked about
 

3127
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,349
you've talked about
of course that we you know we shouldn't

3128
00:53:33,349 --> 00:53:33,359
of course that we you know we shouldn't
 

3129
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:35,030
of course that we you know we shouldn't
be so obsessed about creating human

3130
00:53:35,030 --> 00:53:35,040
be so obsessed about creating human
 

3131
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,309
be so obsessed about creating human
level intelligence

3132
00:53:36,309 --> 00:53:36,319
level intelligence
 

3133
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:38,309
level intelligence
just create systems that are very useful

3134
00:53:38,309 --> 00:53:38,319
just create systems that are very useful
 

3135
00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:39,910
just create systems that are very useful
for humans but what do you think it

3136
00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:39,920
for humans but what do you think it
 

3137
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:41,910
for humans but what do you think it
takes

3138
00:53:41,910 --> 00:53:41,920
takes
 

3139
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:44,870
takes
to uh to uh yeah approach that level

3140
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:44,880
to uh to uh yeah approach that level
 

3141
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:45,990
to uh to uh yeah approach that level
right

3142
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:46,000
right
 

3143
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,910
right
so certainly i don't think human level

3144
00:53:47,910 --> 00:53:47,920
so certainly i don't think human level
 

3145
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:49,510
so certainly i don't think human level
intelligence is one thing

3146
00:53:49,510 --> 00:53:49,520
intelligence is one thing
 

3147
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,030
intelligence is one thing
right so i think there's lots of

3148
00:53:51,030 --> 00:53:51,040
right so i think there's lots of
 

3149
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:52,150
right so i think there's lots of
different tasks lots of different

3150
00:53:52,150 --> 00:53:52,160
different tasks lots of different
 

3151
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:53,910
different tasks lots of different
capabilities

3152
00:53:53,910 --> 00:53:53,920
capabilities
 

3153
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,910
capabilities
i also don't think uh that should be the

3154
00:53:55,910 --> 00:53:55,920
i also don't think uh that should be the
 

3155
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:57,990
i also don't think uh that should be the
goal right so i you know

3156
00:53:57,990 --> 00:53:58,000
goal right so i you know
 

3157
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,870
goal right so i you know
i wouldn't want to create a uh

3158
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:00,880
i wouldn't want to create a uh
 

3159
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:02,790
i wouldn't want to create a uh
calculator that could do multiplication

3160
00:54:02,790 --> 00:54:02,800
calculator that could do multiplication
 

3161
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,150
calculator that could do multiplication
at human levels right

3162
00:54:04,150 --> 00:54:04,160
at human levels right
 

3163
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,470
at human levels right
that would be a step backwards and so

3164
00:54:06,470 --> 00:54:06,480
that would be a step backwards and so
 

3165
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,390
that would be a step backwards and so
for many things we should be aiming far

3166
00:54:08,390 --> 00:54:08,400
for many things we should be aiming far
 

3167
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,549
for many things we should be aiming far
beyond human level

3168
00:54:10,549 --> 00:54:10,559
beyond human level
 

3169
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:13,109
beyond human level
for other things maybe human level is a

3170
00:54:13,109 --> 00:54:13,119
for other things maybe human level is a
 

3171
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:15,270
for other things maybe human level is a
good level to aim at

3172
00:54:15,270 --> 00:54:15,280
good level to aim at
 

3173
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:17,270
good level to aim at
and for others we say well let's not

3174
00:54:17,270 --> 00:54:17,280
and for others we say well let's not
 

3175
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:18,950
and for others we say well let's not
bother doing this because we already

3176
00:54:18,950 --> 00:54:18,960
bother doing this because we already
 

3177
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:21,910
bother doing this because we already
have humans can take on those tasks

3178
00:54:21,910 --> 00:54:21,920
have humans can take on those tasks
 

3179
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:24,710
have humans can take on those tasks
so as you say i like to focus on what

3180
00:54:24,710 --> 00:54:24,720
so as you say i like to focus on what
 

3181
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,390
so as you say i like to focus on what
what's a useful tool

3182
00:54:26,390 --> 00:54:26,400
what's a useful tool
 

3183
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:29,990
what's a useful tool
and and in some cases being on human

3184
00:54:29,990 --> 00:54:30,000
and and in some cases being on human
 

3185
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:30,390
and and in some cases being on human
level

3186
00:54:30,390 --> 00:54:30,400
level
 

3187
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,069
level
is an important part of crossing that

3188
00:54:32,069 --> 00:54:32,079
is an important part of crossing that
 

3189
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:34,470
is an important part of crossing that
threshold to make the tool useful

3190
00:54:34,470 --> 00:54:34,480
threshold to make the tool useful
 

3191
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:37,829
threshold to make the tool useful
so we see in things like these uh

3192
00:54:37,829 --> 00:54:37,839
so we see in things like these uh
 

3193
00:54:37,839 --> 00:54:39,270
so we see in things like these uh
personal assistants now

3194
00:54:39,270 --> 00:54:39,280
personal assistants now
 

3195
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,270
personal assistants now
that you get either on your phone or on

3196
00:54:41,270 --> 00:54:41,280
that you get either on your phone or on
 

3197
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:44,390
that you get either on your phone or on
a speaker that sits on the table

3198
00:54:44,390 --> 00:54:44,400
a speaker that sits on the table
 

3199
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:45,190
a speaker that sits on the table
you want to be able to have a

3200
00:54:45,190 --> 00:54:45,200
you want to be able to have a
 

3201
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,430
you want to be able to have a
conversation with those and

3202
00:54:47,430 --> 00:54:47,440
conversation with those and
 

3203
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:50,069
conversation with those and
and i think as an industry we haven't

3204
00:54:50,069 --> 00:54:50,079
and i think as an industry we haven't
 

3205
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:51,510
and i think as an industry we haven't
quite figured out what the right model

3206
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:51,520
quite figured out what the right model
 

3207
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:52,230
quite figured out what the right model
is for

3208
00:54:52,230 --> 00:54:52,240
is for
 

3209
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:55,190
is for
what these things can do and we're

3210
00:54:55,190 --> 00:54:55,200
what these things can do and we're
 

3211
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,710
what these things can do and we're
aiming towards well you just have a

3212
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:56,720
aiming towards well you just have a
 

3213
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,390
aiming towards well you just have a
conversation with them the way you can

3214
00:54:58,390 --> 00:54:58,400
conversation with them the way you can
 

3215
00:54:58,400 --> 00:54:59,190
conversation with them the way you can
with the person

3216
00:54:59,190 --> 00:54:59,200
with the person
 

3217
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,430
with the person
right but we haven't delivered on that

3218
00:55:01,430 --> 00:55:01,440
right but we haven't delivered on that
 

3219
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:02,309
right but we haven't delivered on that
model yet

3220
00:55:02,309 --> 00:55:02,319
model yet
 

3221
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:04,470
model yet
right so you can ask it what's the

3222
00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:04,480
right so you can ask it what's the
 

3223
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:06,309
right so you can ask it what's the
weather you can ask it

3224
00:55:06,309 --> 00:55:06,319
weather you can ask it
 

3225
00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:09,750
weather you can ask it
play some nice songs uh and

3226
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:09,760
play some nice songs uh and
 

3227
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:11,589
play some nice songs uh and
uh you know five or six other things and

3228
00:55:11,589 --> 00:55:11,599
uh you know five or six other things and
 

3229
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:13,910
uh you know five or six other things and
then you run out of stuff that it can do

3230
00:55:13,910 --> 00:55:13,920
then you run out of stuff that it can do
 

3231
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:16,309
then you run out of stuff that it can do
in terms of a deep meaningful connection

3232
00:55:16,309 --> 00:55:16,319
in terms of a deep meaningful connection
 

3233
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:18,230
in terms of a deep meaningful connection
so you've mentioned the movie her as one

3234
00:55:18,230 --> 00:55:18,240
so you've mentioned the movie her as one
 

3235
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,230
so you've mentioned the movie her as one
of your favorite ai movies

3236
00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:20,240
of your favorite ai movies
 

3237
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:21,670
of your favorite ai movies
do you think it's possible for a human

3238
00:55:21,670 --> 00:55:21,680
do you think it's possible for a human
 

3239
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:23,990
do you think it's possible for a human
being to fall in love with an ai system

3240
00:55:23,990 --> 00:55:24,000
being to fall in love with an ai system
 

3241
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,589
being to fall in love with an ai system
ai assistant as you mentioned

3242
00:55:25,589 --> 00:55:25,599
ai assistant as you mentioned
 

3243
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:28,230
ai assistant as you mentioned
so taking this big leap from uh what's

3244
00:55:28,230 --> 00:55:28,240
so taking this big leap from uh what's
 

3245
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:29,270
so taking this big leap from uh what's
the weather to

you know we sometimes have these tests
where it's easy to fool

3374
00:57:45,910 --> 00:57:45,920
where it's easy to fool
 

3375
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:49,510
where it's easy to fool
the system where you can have a chatbot

3376
00:57:49,510 --> 00:57:49,520
the system where you can have a chatbot
 

3377
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:50,230
the system where you can have a chatbot
that can

3378
00:57:50,230 --> 00:57:50,240
that can
 

3379
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:53,349

never gets into a situation where it has

3382
00:57:54,710 --> 00:57:54,720
never gets into a situation where it has
 

3383
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:55,589
never gets into a situation where it has
to be deep enough

3384
00:57:55,589 --> 00:57:55,599
to be deep enough
 

3385
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:58,630
to be deep enough
that uh it really reveals itself

3386
00:57:58,630 --> 00:57:58,640
that uh it really reveals itself
 

3387
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:01,670
that uh it really reveals itself
as being intelligent or not i think

3388
00:58:01,670 --> 00:58:01,680
as being intelligent or not i think
 

3389
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:04,870
as being intelligent or not i think
uh you know turing suggested that

3390
00:58:04,870 --> 00:58:04,880
uh you know turing suggested that
 

3391
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:07,910
uh you know turing suggested that
uh but i think if he were alive he'd say

3392
00:58:07,910 --> 00:58:07,920
uh but i think if he were alive he'd say
 

3393
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:09,109
uh but i think if he were alive he'd say
you know i didn't really mean that

3394
00:58:09,109 --> 00:58:09,119
you know i didn't really mean that
 

3395
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:10,549
you know i didn't really mean that
seriously

3396
00:58:10,549 --> 00:58:10,559
seriously
 

3397
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:13,829
seriously
right yeah and i think uh and you know

3398
00:58:13,829 --> 00:58:13,839
right yeah and i think uh and you know
 

3399
00:58:13,839 --> 00:58:15,910
right yeah and i think uh and you know
this is just my opinion but but i think

3400
00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:15,920
this is just my opinion but but i think
 

3401
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:19,109
this is just my opinion but but i think
turing's point was not that uh

3402
00:58:19,109 --> 00:58:19,119
turing's point was not that uh
 

3403
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:21,430
turing's point was not that uh
this test of conversation is a good test

3404
00:58:21,430 --> 00:58:21,440
this test of conversation is a good test
 

3405
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:23,109
this test of conversation is a good test
i think his point was

3406
00:58:23,109 --> 00:58:23,119
i think his point was
 

3407
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:25,510
i think his point was
having a test is the right thing so

3408
00:58:25,510 --> 00:58:25,520
having a test is the right thing so
 

3409
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:26,309
having a test is the right thing so
rather than

3410
00:58:26,309 --> 00:58:26,319
rather than
 

3411
00:58:26,319 --> 00:58:29,030
rather than
having the philosopher say oh no ai is

3412
00:58:29,030 --> 00:58:29,040
having the philosopher say oh no ai is
 

3413
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:30,230
having the philosopher say oh no ai is
impossible

3414
00:58:30,230 --> 00:58:30,240
impossible
 

3415
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:31,670
impossible
you should say well we'll just have a

3416
00:58:31,670 --> 00:58:31,680
you should say well we'll just have a
 

3417
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:33,430
you should say well we'll just have a
test and then the result of that will

3418
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:33,440
test and then the result of that will
 

3419
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:34,950
test and then the result of that will
will tell us the answer and it doesn't

3420
00:58:34,950 --> 00:58:34,960
will tell us the answer and it doesn't
 

3421
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:36,549
will tell us the answer and it doesn't
necessarily have to be a conversation

3422
00:58:36,549 --> 00:58:36,559
necessarily have to be a conversation
 

3423
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:37,109
necessarily have to be a conversation
test

3424
00:58:37,109 --> 00:58:37,119
test
 

3425
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:38,789
test
that's right and coming up a new better

3426
00:58:38,789 --> 00:58:38,799
that's right and coming up a new better
 

3427
00:58:38,799 --> 00:58:40,309
that's right and coming up a new better
test as the technology evolves is

3428
00:58:40,309 --> 00:58:40,319
test as the technology evolves is
 

3429
00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:42,150
test as the technology evolves is
probably the right way

3430
00:58:42,150 --> 00:58:42,160
probably the right way
 

3431
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:44,870
probably the right way
do you worry as a lot of the general

3432
00:58:44,870 --> 00:58:44,880
do you worry as a lot of the general
 

3433
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:45,750
do you worry as a lot of the general
public does

3434
00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:45,760
public does
 

3435
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:49,270
public does
about not a lot but some vocal

3436
00:58:49,270 --> 00:58:49,280
about not a lot but some vocal
 

3437
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:51,270
about not a lot but some vocal
uh part of the general public about the

3438
00:58:51,270 --> 00:58:51,280
uh part of the general public about the
 

3439
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,030
uh part of the general public about the
existential threat of artificial

3440
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:53,040
existential threat of artificial
 

3441
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:54,150
existential threat of artificial
intelligence so

3442
00:58:54,150 --> 00:58:54,160
intelligence so
 

3443
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:56,549
intelligence so
looking farther into the future as you

3444
00:58:56,549 --> 00:58:56,559
looking farther into the future as you
 

3445
00:58:56,559 --> 00:58:58,309
looking farther into the future as you
said most of us are not able to predict

3446
00:58:58,309 --> 00:58:58,319
said most of us are not able to predict
 

3447
00:58:58,319 --> 00:58:59,030
said most of us are not able to predict
much

3448
00:58:59,030 --> 00:58:59,040
much
 

3449
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:01,190
much
so when shrouded in such mystery there's

3450
00:59:01,190 --> 00:59:01,200
so when shrouded in such mystery there's
 

3451
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:02,470
so when shrouded in such mystery there's
a concern of

3452
00:59:02,470 --> 00:59:02,480
a concern of
 

3453
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,150
a concern of
well you think you start thinking about

3454
00:59:04,150 --> 00:59:04,160
well you think you start thinking about
 

3455
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:05,750
well you think you start thinking about
worst case is that something that

3456
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:05,760
worst case is that something that
 

3457
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:07,270
worst case is that something that
occupies your mind

3458
00:59:07,270 --> 00:59:07,280
occupies your mind
 

3459
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:10,549
occupies your mind
space much so i certainly think about

3460
00:59:10,549 --> 00:59:10,559
space much so i certainly think about
 

3461
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:13,910
space much so i certainly think about
uh threats i think about uh dangers uh

3462
00:59:13,910 --> 00:59:13,920
uh threats i think about uh dangers uh
 

3463
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:17,270
uh threats i think about uh dangers uh
and i think uh any new technology uh

3464
00:59:17,270 --> 00:59:17,280
and i think uh any new technology uh
 

3465
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:20,230
and i think uh any new technology uh
has positives and negatives and if it's

3466
00:59:20,230 --> 00:59:20,240
has positives and negatives and if it's
 

3467
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:21,430
has positives and negatives and if it's
a powerful technology

3468
00:59:21,430 --> 00:59:21,440
a powerful technology
 

3469
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:23,349
a powerful technology
it can be used for bad as well as for

3470
00:59:23,349 --> 00:59:23,359
it can be used for bad as well as for
 

3471
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:24,630
it can be used for bad as well as for
good

3472
00:59:24,630 --> 00:59:24,640
good
 

3473
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:27,109
good
so i'm certainly not worried about uh

3474
00:59:27,109 --> 00:59:27,119
so i'm certainly not worried about uh
 

3475
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:29,589
so i'm certainly not worried about uh
the robot apocalypse

3476
00:59:29,589 --> 00:59:29,599
the robot apocalypse
 

3477
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:32,870
the robot apocalypse
the terminator type scenarios i am

3478
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:32,880
the terminator type scenarios i am
 

3479
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:35,270
the terminator type scenarios i am
worried about

3480
00:59:35,270 --> 00:59:35,280
worried about
 

3481
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:38,309
worried about
change in employment and

3482
00:59:38,309 --> 00:59:38,319
change in employment and
 

3483
00:59:38,319 --> 00:59:40,710
change in employment and
uh are we going to be able to react fast

3484
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:40,720
uh are we going to be able to react fast
 

3485
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:41,829
uh are we going to be able to react fast
enough to deal with that

3486
00:59:41,829 --> 00:59:41,839
enough to deal with that
 

3487
00:59:41,839 --> 00:59:43,270
enough to deal with that
i think we're you know we're already

3488
00:59:43,270 --> 00:59:43,280
i think we're you know we're already
 

3489
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:44,950
i think we're you know we're already
seeing it today where a lot of people

3490
00:59:44,950 --> 00:59:44,960
seeing it today where a lot of people
 

3491
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:45,510
seeing it today where a lot of people
are

3492
00:59:45,510 --> 00:59:45,520
are
 

3493
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:48,630
are
are disgruntled about uh the way income

3494
00:59:48,630 --> 00:59:48,640
are disgruntled about uh the way income
 

3495
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:50,150
are disgruntled about uh the way income
inequality is working

3496
00:59:50,150 --> 00:59:50,160
inequality is working
 

3497
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:52,710
inequality is working
and uh and automation could help

3498
00:59:52,710 --> 00:59:52,720
and uh and automation could help
 

3499
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:54,549
and uh and automation could help
accelerate those kinds of

3500
00:59:54,549 --> 00:59:54,559
accelerate those kinds of
 

3501
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:57,670
accelerate those kinds of
problems i see powerful technologies can

3502
00:59:57,670 --> 00:59:57,680
problems i see powerful technologies can
 

3503
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:00,230
problems i see powerful technologies can
always be used as weapons uh whether

3504
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:00,240
always be used as weapons uh whether
 

3505
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:00,789
always be used as weapons uh whether
they're

3506
01:00:00,789 --> 01:00:00,799
they're
 

3507
01:00:00,799 --> 01:00:03,670
they're
robots or drones or whatever uh some of

3508
01:00:03,670 --> 01:00:03,680
robots or drones or whatever uh some of
 

3509
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:04,549
robots or drones or whatever uh some of
that

3510
01:00:04,549 --> 01:00:04,559
that
 

3511
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:07,430
that
we're seeing due to ai a lot of it you

3512
01:00:07,430 --> 01:00:07,440
we're seeing due to ai a lot of it you
 

3513
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:09,430
we're seeing due to ai a lot of it you
don't need ai

3514
01:00:09,430 --> 01:00:09,440
don't need ai
 

3515
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,510
don't need ai
and i don't know what's uh what's a

3516
01:00:11,510 --> 01:00:11,520
and i don't know what's uh what's a
 

3517
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:12,950
and i don't know what's uh what's a
worse threat if it's

3518
01:00:12,950 --> 01:00:12,960
worse threat if it's
 

3519
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:16,230
worse threat if it's
an autonomous drone or it's uh

3520
01:00:16,230 --> 01:00:16,240
an autonomous drone or it's uh
 

3521
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:18,950
an autonomous drone or it's uh
crispr technology becoming available or

3522
01:00:18,950 --> 01:00:18,960
crispr technology becoming available or
 

3523
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:20,309
crispr technology becoming available or
we have lots of

3524
01:00:20,309 --> 01:00:20,319
we have lots of
 

3525
01:00:20,319 --> 01:00:22,390
we have lots of
threats to face and some of them involve

3526
01:00:22,390 --> 01:00:22,400
threats to face and some of them involve
 

3527
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:24,549
threats to face and some of them involve
ai and some of them don't

3528
01:00:24,549 --> 01:00:24,559
ai and some of them don't
 

3529
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:27,109
ai and some of them don't
so the threats that technology presents

3530
01:00:27,109 --> 01:00:27,119
so the threats that technology presents
 

3531
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:28,870
so the threats that technology presents
are you for the most part optimistic

3532
01:00:28,870 --> 01:00:28,880
are you for the most part optimistic
 

3533
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:32,470
are you for the most part optimistic
about technology also alleviating those

3534
01:00:32,470 --> 01:00:32,480
about technology also alleviating those
 

3535
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:34,950
about technology also alleviating those
threats so creating new opportunities or

3536
01:00:34,950 --> 01:00:34,960
threats so creating new opportunities or
 

3537
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:37,829
threats so creating new opportunities or
protecting us from the more detrimental

3538
01:00:37,829 --> 01:00:37,839
protecting us from the more detrimental
 

3539
01:00:37,839 --> 01:00:38,950
protecting us from the more detrimental
effects of these things yeah i don't

3540
01:00:38,950 --> 01:00:38,960
effects of these things yeah i don't
 

3541
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:40,710
effects of these things yeah i don't
know it again it's hard to predict the

3542
01:00:40,710 --> 01:00:40,720
know it again it's hard to predict the
 

3543
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:41,349
know it again it's hard to predict the
future

3544
01:00:41,349 --> 01:00:41,359
future
 

3545
01:00:41,359 --> 01:00:44,789
future
and uh yes as a success society

3546
01:00:44,789 --> 01:00:44,799
and uh yes as a success society
 

3547
01:00:44,799 --> 01:00:48,710
and uh yes as a success society
so far we've survived the nuclear

3548
01:00:48,710 --> 01:00:48,720
so far we've survived the nuclear
 

3549
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:51,910
so far we've survived the nuclear
systems and other things of course uh

3550
01:00:51,910 --> 01:00:51,920
systems and other things of course uh
 

3551
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:53,589
systems and other things of course uh
only societies that have survived are

3552
01:00:53,589 --> 01:00:53,599
only societies that have survived are
 

3553
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:56,150
only societies that have survived are
having this conversation so uh maybe

3554
01:00:56,150 --> 01:00:56,160
having this conversation so uh maybe
 

3555
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:59,190
having this conversation so uh maybe
that's a survivorship bias there yeah

3556
01:00:59,190 --> 01:00:59,200
that's a survivorship bias there yeah
 

3557
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:01,270
that's a survivorship bias there yeah
what problem stands out to you as

3558
01:01:01,270 --> 01:01:01,280
what problem stands out to you as
 

3559
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:02,710
what problem stands out to you as
exciting challenging

3560
01:01:02,710 --> 01:01:02,720
exciting challenging
 

3561
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:05,510
exciting challenging
impactful to work on in the near future

3562
01:01:05,510 --> 01:01:05,520
impactful to work on in the near future
 

3563
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:06,309
impactful to work on in the near future
for yourself

3564
01:01:06,309 --> 01:01:06,319
for yourself
 

3565
01:01:06,319 --> 01:01:09,990
for yourself
for the community in broadly so i

3566
01:01:09,990 --> 01:01:10,000
for the community in broadly so i
 

3567
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,510
for the community in broadly so i
you know we talked about these uh

3568
01:01:11,510 --> 01:01:11,520
you know we talked about these uh
 

3569
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:13,510
you know we talked about these uh
assistance in conversation i think

3570
01:01:13,510 --> 01:01:13,520
assistance in conversation i think
 

3571
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:14,870
assistance in conversation i think
that's a great area

3572
01:01:14,870 --> 01:01:14,880
that's a great area
 

3573
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:19,030
that's a great area
i think combining uh

3574
01:01:19,030 --> 01:01:19,040
i think combining uh
 

3575
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:22,230
i think combining uh
common sense reasoning uh with

3576
01:01:22,230 --> 01:01:22,240
common sense reasoning uh with
 

3577
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:26,309
common sense reasoning uh with
the power of data is a a great area

3578
01:01:26,309 --> 01:01:26,319
the power of data is a a great area
 

3579
01:01:26,319 --> 01:01:28,230
the power of data is a a great area
in which application in in conversation

3580
01:01:28,230 --> 01:01:28,240
in which application in in conversation
 

3581
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:29,750
in which application in in conversation
relation or just broadly just

01:01:29,750 --> 01:01:29,760
relation or just broadly just
 

3583
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:32,950

in general yeah as a programmer i'm

3584
01:01:32,950 --> 01:01:32,960
in general yeah as a programmer i'm
 

3585
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:33,910
in general yeah as a programmer i'm
interested in

3586
01:01:33,910 --> 01:01:33,920
interested in
 

3587
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:37,109
interested in
uh programming tools both in terms of

3588
01:01:37,109 --> 01:01:37,119
uh programming tools both in terms of
 

3589
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:39,270
uh programming tools both in terms of
uh you know the current systems we have

3590
01:01:39,270 --> 01:01:39,280
uh you know the current systems we have
 

3591
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:41,670
uh you know the current systems we have
today with with tensorflow and so on can

3592
01:01:41,670 --> 01:01:41,680
today with with tensorflow and so on can
 

3593
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:42,309
today with with tensorflow and so on can
we make them

3594
01:01:42,309 --> 01:01:42,319
we make them
 

3595
01:01:42,319 --> 01:01:44,789
we make them
much easier to use for broader uh class

3596
01:01:44,789 --> 01:01:44,799
much easier to use for broader uh class
 

3597
01:01:44,799 --> 01:01:45,990
much easier to use for broader uh class
of people

3598
01:01:45,990 --> 01:01:46,000
of people
 

3599
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,390
of people
and also can we apply uh machine

3600
01:01:48,390 --> 01:01:48,400
and also can we apply uh machine
 

3601
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:49,270
and also can we apply uh machine
learning

3602
01:01:49,270 --> 01:01:49,280
learning
 

3603
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:51,190
learning
to the more traditional type of

3604
01:01:51,190 --> 01:01:51,200
to the more traditional type of
 

3605
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:53,109
to the more traditional type of
programming right so

3606
01:01:53,109 --> 01:01:53,119
programming right so
 

3607
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:55,430
programming right so
you know when you go to google and you

3608
01:01:55,430 --> 01:01:55,440
you know when you go to google and you
 

3609
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:56,309
you know when you go to google and you
uh

3610
01:01:56,309 --> 01:01:56,319
uh
 

3611
01:01:56,319 --> 01:01:58,150
uh
type in a query and you spell something

3612
01:01:58,150 --> 01:01:58,160
type in a query and you spell something
 

3613
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:00,470
type in a query and you spell something
wrong it says did you mean

3614
01:02:00,470 --> 01:02:00,480
wrong it says did you mean
 

3615
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:01,910
wrong it says did you mean
and the reason we're able to do that is

3616
01:02:01,910 --> 01:02:01,920
and the reason we're able to do that is
 

3617
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:03,589
and the reason we're able to do that is
because lots of other people made a

3618
01:02:03,589 --> 01:02:03,599
because lots of other people made a
 

3619
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:06,390
because lots of other people made a
similar error and then they corrected it

3620
01:02:06,390 --> 01:02:06,400
similar error and then they corrected it
 

3621
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:08,470
similar error and then they corrected it
we should be able to go into our code

3622
01:02:08,470 --> 01:02:08,480
we should be able to go into our code
 

3623
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:10,789
we should be able to go into our code
bases and our bug fix spaces

3624
01:02:10,789 --> 01:02:10,799
bases and our bug fix spaces
 

3625
01:02:10,799 --> 01:02:12,789
bases and our bug fix spaces
and when i type a line of code it should

3626
01:02:12,789 --> 01:02:12,799
and when i type a line of code it should
 

3627
01:02:12,799 --> 01:02:13,829
and when i type a line of code it should
be able to say

3628
01:02:13,829 --> 01:02:13,839
be able to say
 

3629
01:02:13,839 --> 01:02:15,510
be able to say
did you mean such and such if you type

3630
01:02:15,510 --> 01:02:15,520
did you mean such and such if you type
 

3631
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:17,430
did you mean such and such if you type
this today you're probably going to

3632
01:02:17,430 --> 01:02:17,440
this today you're probably going to
 

3633
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:20,549
this today you're probably going to
type in this bug fix tomorrow

3634
01:02:20,549 --> 01:02:20,559
type in this bug fix tomorrow
 

3635
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:21,670
type in this bug fix tomorrow
yeah that's a really exciting

3636
01:02:21,670 --> 01:02:21,680
yeah that's a really exciting
 

3637
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:23,829
yeah that's a really exciting
application of uh almost

3638
01:02:23,829 --> 01:02:23,839
application of uh almost
 

3639
01:02:23,839 --> 01:02:26,309
application of uh almost
uh an assistant for the coding

3640
01:02:26,309 --> 01:02:26,319
