concerned with how many clicks they're

00:26:19,569 --> 00:26:19,579
concerned with how many clicks they're
 

1107

concerned with how many clicks they're
getting that you know whereas I know at

1108
00:26:24,129 --> 00:26:24,139
getting that you know whereas I know at
 

1109
00:26:24,139 --> 00:26:26,949
getting that you know whereas I know at
the start of World War one that both the

1110
00:26:26,949 --> 00:26:26,959
the start of World War one that both the
 

1111
00:26:26,959 --> 00:26:30,099
the start of World War one that both the
younger generations were eager to go to

00:26:30,099 --> 00:26:30,109
younger generations were eager to go to
 

1113
00:26:30,109 --> 00:26:33,219

1116
00:26:35,499 --> 00:26:35,509
was insane but it was that sort of
 

1117
00:26:35,509 --> 00:26:37,060
was insane but it was that sort of
warrior archetype that we were talking

1118
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:37,070
warrior archetype that we were talking
 

1119
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:42,029
warrior archetype that we were talking
about before that that generational

1120
00:26:42,029 --> 00:26:42,039
about before that that generational
 

1121
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:46,419
about before that that generational
testosterone arrows thing wears nowadays

1122
00:26:46,419 --> 00:26:46,429
testosterone arrows thing wears nowadays
 

1123
00:26:46,429 --> 00:26:50,049
testosterone arrows thing wears nowadays
I don't know I mean it's hard to say

1124
00:26:50,049 --> 00:26:50,059
I don't know I mean it's hard to say
 

1125
00:26:50,059 --> 00:26:52,479
I don't know I mean it's hard to say
there's not gonna be another war because

1126
00:26:52,479 --> 00:26:52,489
there's not gonna be another war because
 

1127
00:26:52,489 --> 00:26:54,759
there's not gonna be another war because
there always are but it's sort of hard

1128
00:26:54,759 --> 00:26:54,769
there always are but it's sort of hard
 

1129
00:26:54,769 --> 00:26:56,619
there always are but it's sort of hard
to imagine people getting off their ass

1130
00:26:56,619 --> 00:26:56,629
to imagine people getting off their ass
 

1131
00:26:56,629 --> 00:26:59,799
to imagine people getting off their ass
these days to do anything well it's

1132
00:26:59,799 --> 00:26:59,809
these days to do anything well it's
 

1133
00:26:59,809 --> 00:27:01,509
these days to do anything well it's
funny that you mention social media as

1134
00:27:01,509 --> 00:27:01,519
funny that you mention social media as
 

1135
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:04,690
funny that you mention social media as
the place for empathy sure but it's in a

1136
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:04,700
the place for empathy sure but it's in a
 

1137
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:07,869
the place for empathy sure but it's in a
sense that's the place for for war or

1138
00:27:07,869 --> 00:27:07,879
sense that's the place for for war or
 

1139
00:27:07,879 --> 00:27:13,449
sense that's the place for for war or
death from hatred and and perhaps the

1140
00:27:13,449 --> 00:27:13,459
death from hatred and and perhaps the
 

1141
00:27:13,459 --> 00:27:15,909
death from hatred and and perhaps the
positive aspects of hatred on social

1142
00:27:15,909 --> 00:27:15,919
positive aspects of hatred on social
 

1143
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:19,869
positive aspects of hatred on social
media is that it's somewhat less harmful

1144
00:27:19,869 --> 00:27:19,879
media is that it's somewhat less harmful
 

1145
00:27:19,879 --> 00:27:21,849
media is that it's somewhat less harmful
than murder

1146
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:21,859
than murder
 

1147
00:27:21,859 --> 00:27:24,819
than murder
and so it kind of dissipates sort of the

1148
00:27:24,819 --> 00:27:24,829
and so it kind of dissipates sort of the
 

1149
00:27:24,829 --> 00:27:30,879
and so it kind of dissipates sort of the
hate folds you get the hate out at yeah

1150
00:27:30,879 --> 00:27:30,889
hate folds you get the hate out at yeah
 

1151
00:27:30,889 --> 00:27:35,680
hate folds you get the hate out at yeah
and uh you know it'll s yeah on a daily

1152
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:35,690
and uh you know it'll s yeah on a daily
 

1153
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:38,049
and uh you know it'll s yeah on a daily
basis and thereby never boils up to a

1154
00:27:38,049 --> 00:27:38,059
basis and thereby never boils up to a
 

1155
00:27:38,059 --> 00:27:39,879
basis and thereby never boils up to a
point where you want to kill it's also a

1156
00:27:39,879 --> 00:27:39,889
point where you want to kill it's also a
 

1157
00:27:39,889 --> 00:27:42,219
point where you want to kill it's also a
really weird thing that's going on I

1158
00:27:42,219 --> 00:27:42,229
really weird thing that's going on I
 

1159
00:27:42,229 --> 00:27:43,749
really weird thing that's going on I
don't know if anybody really understands

1160
00:27:43,749 --> 00:27:43,759
don't know if anybody really understands
 

1161
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:47,139
don't know if anybody really understands
like with videogames where kids are

1162
00:27:47,139 --> 00:27:47,149
like with videogames where kids are
 

1163
00:27:47,149 --> 00:27:48,609
like with videogames where kids are
acting out these incredible horror

1164
00:27:48,609 --> 00:27:48,619
acting out these incredible horror
 

1165
00:27:48,619 --> 00:27:51,399
acting out these incredible horror
things right but you know that if they

1166
00:27:51,399 --> 00:27:51,409
things right but you know that if they
 

1167
00:27:51,409 --> 00:27:53,829
things right but you know that if they
cut their finger they would like freak

1168
00:27:53,829 --> 00:27:53,839
cut their finger they would like freak
 

1169
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:56,829
cut their finger they would like freak
out I know and and I also don't think

1170
00:27:56,829 --> 00:27:56,839
out I know and and I also don't think
 

1171
00:27:56,839 --> 00:28:00,159
out I know and and I also don't think
that many of the people that are hateful

1172
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:00,169
that many of the people that are hateful
 

1173
00:28:00,169 --> 00:28:03,069
that many of the people that are hateful
on social media if they were face to

1174
00:28:03,069 --> 00:28:03,079
on social media if they were face to
 

1175
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:05,409
on social media if they were face to
face with the horse and they wouldn't so

1176
00:28:05,409 --> 00:28:05,419
face with the horse and they wouldn't so
 

1177
00:28:05,419 --> 00:28:10,899
face with the horse and they wouldn't so
there's a sort of a to to mental spheres

1178
00:28:10,899 --> 00:28:10,909
there's a sort of a to to mental spheres
 

1179
00:28:10,909 --> 00:28:13,629
there's a sort of a to to mental spheres
happening at the same time and I don't

1180
00:28:13,629 --> 00:28:13,639
happening at the same time and I don't
 

1181
00:28:13,639 --> 00:28:17,559
happening at the same time and I don't
know how that maps that out military how

1182
00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:17,569
know how that maps that out military how
 

1183
00:28:17,569 --> 00:28:18,850
know how that maps that out military how
that actually Maps the military

1184
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:18,860
that actually Maps the military
 

1185
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:22,720
that actually Maps the military
yeah yeah it's like when you uni United

1186
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:22,730
yeah yeah it's like when you uni United
 

1187
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:25,539
yeah yeah it's like when you uni United
States have a draft for example what how

1188
00:28:25,539 --> 00:28:25,549
States have a draft for example what how
 

1189
00:28:25,549 --> 00:28:27,520
States have a draft for example what how
the populace will respond different than

1190
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:27,530
the populace will respond different than
 

1191
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:29,620
the populace will respond different than
they did in previous generation yeah I

1192
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:29,630
they did in previous generation yeah I
 

1193
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:31,210
they did in previous generation yeah I
think they certainly would yeah

1194
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:31,220
think they certainly would yeah
 

1195
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:33,760
think they certainly would yeah
another question not sure if you thought

1196
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:33,770
another question not sure if you thought
 

1197
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:36,130
another question not sure if you thought
about it but I work on building

1198
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:36,140
about it but I work on building
 

1199
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:38,410
about it but I work on building
artificial intelligence systems in our

1200
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:38,420
artificial intelligence systems in our
 

1201
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:40,240
artificial intelligence systems in our
community many people worried about AI

1202
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:40,250
community many people worried about AI
 

1203
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:42,970
community many people worried about AI
being used in war so automating the

1204
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:42,980
being used in war so automating the
 

1205
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:46,390
being used in war so automating the
killing process the with with with

1206

killing process the with with with
 

1207
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,250
killing process the with with with
drones and in general is being used more

1208
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:48,260
drones and in general is being used more
 

1209
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:48,789
drones and in general is being used more
and more

1210
00:28:48,789 --> 00:28:48,799
and more
 

1211
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:50,680
and more
I should recuse myself on that when I

1212
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:50,690
I should recuse myself on that when I
 

1213
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:52,090
I should recuse myself on that when I
really haven't thought about haven't

1214
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:52,100
really haven't thought about haven't
 

1215
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,710
really haven't thought about haven't
thought about it I'd rather ask you are

1216
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:53,720
thought about it I'd rather ask you are
 

1217
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,789
thought about it I'd rather ask you are
you thinking

1218
00:28:54,789 --> 00:28:54,799
you thinking
 

1219
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,500
you thinking
well it's interesting I mean because

1220
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:56,510
well it's interesting I mean because
 

1221
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:58,960
well it's interesting I mean because
it's so fundamentally different from if

1222
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:58,970
it's so fundamentally different from if
 

1223
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:02,350
it's so fundamentally different from if
you look at the Battle of Thermopylae it

1224
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:02,360
you look at the Battle of Thermopylae it
 

1225
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,549
you look at the Battle of Thermopylae it
means just if we talk about the

1226
00:29:03,549 --> 00:29:03,559
means just if we talk about the
 

1227
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:07,539
means just if we talk about the
different scene a gun and a sword I'll

1228
00:29:07,539 --> 00:29:07,549
different scene a gun and a sword I'll

which one it was but at one point they
showed him a new invention and it could

1236
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:17,150
showed him a new invention and it could
 

1237
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:20,140
showed him a new invention and it could
launch a bolt that would you know kill

00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:52,180
of doing that even bow and arrow was
considered less than manly and less than

1258
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:52,190
considered less than manly and less than
 

1259
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,980
considered less than manly and less than
honorable and maybe we should go back to

1260
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:53,990
honorable and maybe we should go back to
 

1261
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:55,419
honorable and maybe we should go back to
that because at least it makes the

1262
00:29:55,419 --> 00:29:55,429
that because at least it makes the
 

1263
00:29:55,429 --> 00:30:01,180
that because at least it makes the
stakes real and true and not that we

1264
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:01,190
stakes real and true and not that we
 

1265
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:05,590
stakes real and true and not that we
could not not that's the point you were

1266
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:05,600
could not not that's the point you were
 

1267
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:10,710
could not not that's the point you were
in the Marine Corps so if we talk about

1268
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:10,720
in the Marine Corps so if we talk about
 

1269
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,960
in the Marine Corps so if we talk about
the real the bloody conflicts you've

1270
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:13,970
the real the bloody conflicts you've
 

1271

the real the bloody conflicts you've
written about many of them

1272
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:16,320
written about many of them
 

1273
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,379
written about many of them
so let me ask a personal question

1274
00:30:20,379 --> 00:30:20,389
so let me ask a personal question
 

1275
00:30:20,389 --> 00:30:23,749
so let me ask a personal question
have you sort of as writing and in

1276
00:30:23,749 --> 00:30:23,759
have you sort of as writing and in
 

1277
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:27,110
have you sort of as writing and in
general have you thought about what it

1278
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:27,120
general have you thought about what it
 

1279
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:31,009
general have you thought about what it
takes to kill a person if you yourself

1280
00:30:31,009 --> 00:30:31,019
takes to kill a person if you yourself
 

1281
00:30:31,019 --> 00:30:33,860
takes to kill a person if you yourself
could do it yeah well not about it yeah

1282
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:33,870
could do it yeah well not about it yeah
 

1283
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:38,029
could do it yeah well not about it yeah
and how that would make you feel of

1284
00:30:38,029 --> 00:30:38,039
and how that would make you feel of
 

1285
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:38,330
and how that would make you feel of
course

1286
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:38,340
course
 

1287
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:40,610
course
one never knows I certainly I have not

1288
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:40,620
one never knows I certainly I have not
 

1289
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,310
one never knows I certainly I have not
been in combat I haven't killed anybody

1290
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:42,320
been in combat I haven't killed anybody
 

1291
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:46,960
been in combat I haven't killed anybody
but I would imagine in the real world

1292
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:46,970
but I would imagine in the real world
 

1293
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:52,450
but I would imagine in the real world
that it would change you utterly forever

1294
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:52,460
that it would change you utterly forever
 

1295
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:59,029
that it would change you utterly forever
because you can't help but identify with

1296
00:30:59,029 --> 00:30:59,039
because you can't help but identify with
 

1297
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:00,879
because you can't help but identify with
a person that you've just killed and

1298
00:31:00,879 --> 00:31:00,889
a person that you've just killed and
 

1299
00:31:00,889 --> 00:31:04,369
a person that you've just killed and
it's another human being and I mean I

1300
00:31:04,369 --> 00:31:04,379
it's another human being and I mean I
 

1301
00:31:04,379 --> 00:31:07,730
it's another human being and I mean I
have a hard time killing a spider so I

1302
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:07,740
have a hard time killing a spider so I
 

1303
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:10,450
have a hard time killing a spider so I
would imagine that it's something that

1304
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:10,460
would imagine that it's something that
 

1305
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:13,190
would imagine that it's something that
warriors understand and nobody else

1306
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:13,200
warriors understand and nobody else

00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:19,440
how I mean you've spoken with people who
 

1311
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,419
how I mean you've spoken with people who
seem military combat oh yeah in Israel

thinking of one pilot that I interviewed

1320
00:31:35,629 --> 00:31:35,639
thinking of one pilot that I interviewed
 

1321
00:31:35,639 --> 00:31:42,200
thinking of one pilot that I interviewed
over there who you know was strafing a

tank in his Mustang and saw and at
really low altitude and you know saw

really low altitude and you know saw
what his bullets did to the guy and

1328
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:50,940
what his bullets did to the guy and
 

1329
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,190
what his bullets did to the guy and
could see his face and everything like

1330
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:52,200
could see his face and everything like
 

1331
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,310
could see his face and everything like
that which is even you know one remove

that which is even you know one remove
or more removes from an infantryman when

that God or some force is we're on some

1420
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:07,450
that God or some force is we're on some
 

1421
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:13,230
that God or some force is we're on some
kind of journey but I'm not sure why why

kind of journey but I'm not sure why why
we were put in this world where the

1424
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:16,210
we were put in this world where the
 

1425
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:17,730
we were put in this world where the
ground rules are if you think about

1426
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:17,740
ground rules are if you think about
 

1427
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:21,300
ground rules are if you think about
animal life that you cannot live from

1428
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:21,310
animal life that you cannot live from
 

1429

animal life that you cannot live from
one day to the next without killing and

one day to the next without killing and
 

1431
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:27,090
one day to the next without killing and
eating some other form of life and what

couldn't we just have a solar panel on
 

1437

1494
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:52,720
and I you know there's one of the things
 

1495
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:58,890
and I you know there's one of the things
that I did in my book the artist journey

1496
00:35:58,890 --> 00:35:58,900
that I did in my book the artist journey
 

1497
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,540
that I did in my book the artist journey
is that there were certain things where

1498

is that there were certain things where
 

1499
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:03,030
is that there were certain things where
I tracked or just listed in order like

1500
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:03,040
I tracked or just listed in order like
 

1501
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,670
I tracked or just listed in order like
all of Bruce Springsteen's albums or all

1502
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:05,680
all of Bruce Springsteen's albums or all
 

1503
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,130
all of Bruce Springsteen's albums or all
of Philip Roth's books you know kind of

1504
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:08,140
of Philip Roth's books you know kind of
 

1505
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:10,140
of Philip Roth's books you know kind of
a body of work throughout over you know

1506
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:10,150
a body of work throughout over you know
 

1507
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:13,460
a body of work throughout over you know
a period of 30 40 50 years you know and

1508
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:13,470
a period of 30 40 50 years you know and
 

1509
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:17,880
a period of 30 40 50 years you know and
you can see that there's a theme running

1510
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:17,890
you can see that there's a theme running
 

1511
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:19,890
you can see that there's a theme running
through all of those things that it's

1512
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:19,900
through all of those things that it's
 

1513
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:23,190
through all of those things that it's
completely unique to that person nobody

1514
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:23,200
completely unique to that person nobody
 

1515
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,600
completely unique to that person nobody
else could have written Philip Roth's

1516
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:24,610
else could have written Philip Roth's
 

1517
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:28,500
else could have written Philip Roth's
books or Bruce Springsteen songs and you

1518
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:28,510
books or Bruce Springsteen songs and you
 

1519
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:31,830
books or Bruce Springsteen songs and you
can even see sort of a destiny there so

1520
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:31,840
can even see sort of a destiny there so
 

1521
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:35,220
can even see sort of a destiny there so
I asked myself well where did that come

1522
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:35,230
I asked myself well where did that come
 

1523
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:38,600
I asked myself well where did that come
from what it's it seems to be a

1524
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:38,610
from what it's it seems to be a
 

1525
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:41,370
from what it's it seems to be a
continuation of something that was that

1526
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:41,380
continuation of something that was that
 

1527
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:43,650
continuation of something that was that
happened before and that will lead to

1528
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:43,660
happened before and that will lead to
 

1529
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,540
happened before and that will lead to
something else because it's not starting

1530
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:45,550
something else because it's not starting
 

1531
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:49,210
something else because it's not starting
from scratch it seems like there's a

1532
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:49,220
from scratch it seems like there's a
 

1533
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:52,960
from scratch it seems like there's a
a calling a destiny in there already

1534
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:52,970
a calling a destiny in there already
 

1535
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:54,940
a calling a destiny in there already
this gets back to the Meuse and all that

1536
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:54,950
this gets back to the Meuse and all that
 

1537
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:57,400
this gets back to the Meuse and all that
kind of thing so yeah it's almost like

1538
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:57,410
kind of thing so yeah it's almost like
 

1539
00:36:57,410 --> 00:37:00,750
kind of thing so yeah it's almost like
the there's this let's call it a God

1540
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:00,760
the there's this let's call it a God
 

1541
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:04,960
the there's this let's call it a God
it's passing it's almost like sampling

1542
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:04,970
it's passing it's almost like sampling
 

1543
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:07,930
it's passing it's almost like sampling
parts of a previous human that has lived

1544
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:07,940
parts of a previous human that has lived
 

1545
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:11,160
parts of a previous human that has lived
and putting that those into the new one

1546
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:11,170
and putting that those into the new one
 

1547
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:13,060
and putting that those into the new one
sampling this is probably a pretty good

1548
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:13,070
sampling this is probably a pretty good
 

1549
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:15,099
sampling this is probably a pretty good
work that taking some of the good boy

1550
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:15,109
work that taking some of the good boy
 

1551
00:37:15,109 --> 00:37:16,300
work that taking some of the good boy
you can't take all the good parts

1552
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:16,310
you can't take all the good parts
 

1553
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:18,520
you can't take all the good parts
because the bad parts is what makes the

1554
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:18,530
because the bad parts is what makes the
 

1555
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:20,349
because the bad parts is what makes the
person right let's say taking all

1556
00:37:20,349 --> 00:37:20,359
person right let's say taking all
 

1557
00:37:20,359 --> 00:37:21,760
person right let's say taking all
together okay

1558
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:21,770
together okay
 

1559
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:23,859
together okay
this is humans only does it pass around

1560
00:37:23,859 --> 00:37:23,869
this is humans only does it pass around
 

1561
00:37:23,869 --> 00:37:26,380
this is humans only does it pass around
from animals in your view is they I

1562
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:26,390
from animals in your view is they I

whatever analogy you want to use that

1716
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:12,800
whatever analogy you want to use that
 

1717
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,200
whatever analogy you want to use that
that communication to which degree

1718
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:16,210
that communication to which degree
 

1719
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:18,990
that communication to which degree
is do you play the role in that

1720
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:19,000
is do you play the role in that
 

1721
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,930
is do you play the role in that
communication as opposed to sitting at

1722
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:21,940
communication as opposed to sitting at
 

1723
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:24,660
communication as opposed to sitting at
the computer if you're a writer and

1724
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:24,670
the computer if you're a writer and
 

1725
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:27,810
the computer if you're a writer and
staring at the blank page and putting in

1726
00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:27,820
staring at the blank page and putting in
 

1727
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:32,970
staring at the blank page and putting in
the time and waiting what so if in your

1728
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:32,980
the time and waiting what so if in your
 

1729
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:38,839
the time and waiting what so if in your
in your view it is are these creatures

1730
00:41:38,839 --> 00:41:38,849

 

1731
00:41:38,849 --> 00:41:41,339

basically waiting to tell you about your

1732
00:41:41,339 --> 00:41:41,349
basically waiting to tell you about your
 

1733
00:41:41,349 --> 00:41:45,240
basically waiting to tell you about your
future or is their choice how many

1734
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:45,250
future or is their choice how many
 

1735
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:46,859
future or is their choice how many
possible futures are there how many

1736
00:41:46,859 --> 00:41:46,869
possible futures are there how many
 

1737
00:41:46,869 --> 00:41:49,020
possible futures are there how many
possible ideas are that's a great

1738
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:49,030
possible ideas are that's a great
 

1739
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:52,829
possible ideas are that's a great
question I think there's basically yes

1740
00:41:52,829 --> 00:41:52,839
question I think there's basically yes
 

1741
00:41:52,839 --> 00:41:54,450
question I think there's basically yes
they're all alternatives

1742
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:54,460
they're all alternatives
 

1743
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:57,390
they're all alternatives
you know degrees within it but IFIF you

1744
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:57,400
you know degrees within it but IFIF you
 

1745
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:01,440
you know degrees within it but IFIF you
look at Bruce Springsteen's albums how

1746
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:01,450
look at Bruce Springsteen's albums how
 

1747
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:04,290
look at Bruce Springsteen's albums how
much could he have done really

1748
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:04,300
much could he have done really
 

1749
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:07,740
much could he have done really
differently yeah he would you can just

1750
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:07,750
differently yeah he would you can just
 

1751
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:09,870
differently yeah he would you can just
see there's a whole impetus we're going

1752
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:09,880
see there's a whole impetus we're going
 

1753
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:12,060
see there's a whole impetus we're going
through the whole thing and nothing was

1754
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:12,070
through the whole thing and nothing was
 

1755
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:13,970
through the whole thing and nothing was
gonna shake him off that you know and

1756
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:13,980
gonna shake him off that you know and
 

1757
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:16,290
gonna shake him off that you know and
yeah maybe the river could have been

1758
00:42:16,290 --> 00:42:16,300
yeah maybe the river could have been
 

1759
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:17,940
yeah maybe the river could have been
different it could have been called

1760
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:17,950
different it could have been called
 

1761
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:21,089
different it could have been called
something else but but he was dealing

1762
00:42:21,089 --> 00:42:21,099
something else but but he was dealing
 

1763
00:42:21,099 --> 00:42:24,210
something else but but he was dealing
with certain issues his conscious self

1764
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:24,220
with certain issues his conscious self
 

1765
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:25,770
with certain issues his conscious self
was dealing with certain issues that

1766
00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:25,780
was dealing with certain issues that
 

1767
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:28,620
was dealing with certain issues that
were really out of his control he was he

1768
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:28,630
were really out of his control he was he
 

1769
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:30,480
were really out of his control he was he
was drawn he was called to it right

1770
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:30,490
was drawn he was called to it right
 

1771
00:42:30,490 --> 00:42:35,640
was drawn he was called to it right
nothing could stop him and so it is sort

1772
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:35,650
nothing could stop him and so it is sort
 

1773
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:37,440
nothing could stop him and so it is sort
of a partnership but I think the

1774
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:37,450
of a partnership but I think the
 

1775
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:41,190
of a partnership but I think the
creative process between the creative

1776
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:41,200
creative process between the creative
 

1777
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,540
creative process between the creative
impulse that's coming from some other

1778
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:42,550
impulse that's coming from some other
 

1779
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:46,980
impulse that's coming from some other
place or it's coming from deep within us

1780
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:46,990
place or it's coming from deep within us
 

1781
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:48,660
place or it's coming from deep within us
is another way to look at it you know

1782
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:48,670
is another way to look at it you know
 

1783
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:51,270
is another way to look at it you know
it's a like if we are acorns and and

1784
00:42:51,270 --> 00:42:51,280
it's a like if we are acorns and and
 

1785
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:55,589
it's a like if we are acorns and and
we're growing then to Oaks so the

1786
00:42:55,589 --> 00:42:55,599
we're growing then to Oaks so the
 

1787
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:58,740
we're growing then to Oaks so the
conscious bird artist who's sitting

1788
00:42:58,740 --> 00:42:58,750
conscious bird artist who's sitting
 

1789
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:00,890
conscious bird artist who's sitting
there at the keyboard or whatever is

1790
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:00,900
there at the keyboard or whatever is
 

1791
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:04,079
there at the keyboard or whatever is
applying his or her consciousness to

1792
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:04,089
applying his or her consciousness to
 

1793
00:43:04,089 --> 00:43:08,339
applying his or her consciousness to
that but is also going into opening

1794
00:43:08,339 --> 00:43:08,349
that but is also going into opening
 

1795
00:43:08,349 --> 00:43:10,349
that but is also going into opening
themselves to the unconscious or to this

1796
00:43:10,349 --> 00:43:10,359
themselves to the unconscious or to this
 

1797
00:43:10,359 --> 00:43:12,570
themselves to the unconscious or to this
other realm whatever whatever that is I

1798
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:12,580
other realm whatever whatever that is I
 

1799
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:15,960
other realm whatever whatever that is I
mean certainly songwriters for a million

1800
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:15,970
mean certainly songwriters for a million
 

1801
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:17,310
mean certainly songwriters for a million
years have said you know a song just

1802
00:43:17,310 --> 00:43:17,320
years have said you know a song just
 

1803
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:19,589
years have said you know a song just
came in over their head right home just

1804
00:43:19,589 --> 00:43:19,599
came in over their head right home just
 

1805
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:22,320
came in over their head right home just
all I had to do is write but then you

1806
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:22,330
all I had to do is write but then you
 

1807
00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:24,630
all I had to do is write but then you
ever see that thing where of Keats's

1808
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:24,640
ever see that thing where of Keats's
 

1809
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:27,120
ever see that thing where of Keats's
notes for a thing of beauty is a joy

1810
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:27,130
notes for a thing of beauty is a joy
 

1811
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:27,900
notes for a thing of beauty is a joy
forever

1812
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:27,910
forever
 

1813
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:29,640
forever
it's like covers an entire pay

1814
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:29,650
it's like covers an entire pay
 

1815
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:31,589

it's like you know he's crossing this

1816
00:43:31,589 --> 00:43:31,599
it's like you know he's crossing this
 

1817

it's like you know he's crossing this
out and that out yet so though his

out and that out yet so though his
 

1819
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:35,519

working on it but I saw I I do think

1822
00:43:38,819 --> 00:43:38,829
working on it but I saw I I do think
 

1823
00:43:38,829 --> 00:43:40,440
working on it but I saw I I do think
it's a partnership and I think that I

1824
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:40,450
it's a partnership and I think that I
 

1825
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:42,900
it's a partnership and I think that I
know when I was first starting out as a

1826
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:42,910
know when I was first starting out as a
 

1827
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:46,349
know when I was first starting out as a
writer I worked in advertising and I and

do I was like really unskilled at
getting to that tuning into that station

1834
00:43:55,950 --> 00:43:55,960
getting to that tuning into that station
 

1835
00:43:55,960 --> 00:44:00,809
getting to that tuning into that station
I just beat my brains out and was unable

1836
00:44:00,809 --> 00:44:00,819
I just beat my brains out and was unable
 

1837
00:44:00,819 --> 00:44:03,630
I just beat my brains out and was unable
to do it you know except and because I

1838
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:03,640
to do it you know except and because I
 

1839
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:05,640
to do it you know except and because I
was sort of trying too hard it was sort

1840
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:05,650
was sort of trying too hard it was sort
 

1841
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:08,670
was sort of trying too hard it was sort
of like a Zen monk or a monk of some

1842
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:08,680
of like a Zen monk or a monk of some
 

1843

constantly thoughts driving you crazy
 

1847
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:16,500
constantly thoughts driving you crazy
but overtime you know not would I've

1848
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:16,510
but overtime you know not would I've
 

1849
00:44:16,510 --> 00:44:19,680
but overtime you know not would I've
kind of gotten better at it and I can

1850
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:19,690
kind of gotten better at it and I can
 

1851
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:23,039
kind of gotten better at it and I can
sort of let go of those that part of me

1852
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:23,049
sort of let go of those that part of me
 

1853
00:44:23,049 --> 00:44:28,319
sort of let go of those that part of me
that's trying so hard and so these

1854
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:28,329
that's trying so hard and so these
 

1855
00:44:28,329 --> 00:44:30,870
that's trying so hard and so these
angels can speak a little more easily

1856
00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:30,880
angels can speak a little more easily
 

1857
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,720
angels can speak a little more easily
through the membrane can you put into

1858
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:33,730
through the membrane can you put into
 

1859
00:44:33,730 --> 00:44:37,339
through the membrane can you put into
words the process of letting go and

1860
00:44:37,339 --> 00:44:37,349
words the process of letting go and
 

1861
00:44:37,349 --> 00:44:39,900
words the process of letting go and
clearing that channel of communication

1862
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:39,910
clearing that channel of communication
 

1863
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:41,490
clearing that channel of communication
what does it take that's like another

1864
00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:41,500
what does it take that's like another
 

1865
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:43,549
what does it take that's like another
great question for me it just took I

1866
00:44:43,549 --> 00:44:43,559
great question for me it just took I
 

1867
00:44:43,559 --> 00:44:46,740
great question for me it just took I
took probably thirty years and I don't

1868
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:46,750
took probably thirty years and I don't
 

1869
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:48,930
took probably thirty years and I don't
even I would I guess I would liken it to

1870
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:48,940
even I would I guess I would liken it to
 

1871
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:50,190
even I would I guess I would liken it to
meditation even though I'm not a

1872
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:50,200
meditation even though I'm not a
 

1873
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:53,609
meditation even though I'm not a
meditator but it would seem to me to be

1874
00:44:53,609 --> 00:44:53,619
meditator but it would seem to me to be
 

1875
00:44:53,619 --> 00:44:54,870
meditator but it would seem to me to be
one of the hardest things in the world

1876
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:54,880
one of the hardest things in the world
 

1877
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:58,490
one of the hardest things in the world
to just sit still and stop thinking

1878
00:44:58,490 --> 00:44:58,500
to just sit still and stop thinking
 

1879
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:02,940
to just sit still and stop thinking
right and so it's very hard to put into

1880
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:02,950
right and so it's very hard to put into
 

1881
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:04,490
right and so it's very hard to put into
words and I think that's why these

1882
00:45:04,490 --> 00:45:04,500
words and I think that's why these
 

1883
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:08,309
words and I think that's why these
teachers of meditation use tricks and

1884
00:45:08,309 --> 00:45:08,319
teachers of meditation use tricks and
 

1885
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:12,569
teachers of meditation use tricks and
cones and stuff like that but for me at

1886
00:45:12,569 --> 00:45:12,579
cones and stuff like that but for me at
 

1887
00:45:12,579 --> 00:45:15,569
cones and stuff like that but for me at
least I think it was just a process of

1888
00:45:15,569 --> 00:45:15,579
least I think it was just a process of
 

1889
00:45:15,579 --> 00:45:17,599
least I think it was just a process of
years of years and years of trying and

1890
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:17,609
years of years and years of trying and
 

1891
00:45:17,609 --> 00:45:19,980
years of years and years of trying and
finally of beating my head in the wall

1892
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:19,990
finally of beating my head in the wall
 

1893
00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:22,710
finally of beating my head in the wall
and finally little by little giving up

1894
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:22,720
and finally little by little giving up
 

1895
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:26,760
and finally little by little giving up
the bet beating of the the head but this

1896
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:26,770
the bet beating of the the head but this
 

1897
00:45:26,770 --> 00:45:28,349
the bet beating of the the head but this
doesn't seem to be any trick everybody

1898
00:45:28,349 --> 00:45:28,359
doesn't seem to be any trick everybody
 

1899
00:45:28,359 --> 00:45:30,870

writing your then you're looking at what
you wrote you know you're hitting

1966
00:46:57,030 --> 00:46:57,040
you wrote you know you're hitting
 

1967
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:00,870
you wrote you know you're hitting
moments when it flows you know and your

1968
00:47:00,870 --> 00:47:00,880
moments when it flows you know and your
 

1969
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,220
moments when it flows you know and your
and your and in your other hitting

00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:03,480
and your and in your other hitting
moments well you just can't do anything

1972
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:03,490
moments well you just can't do anything
 

1973
00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:05,730
moments well you just can't do anything
and you're trying to from the moments

1974
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:05,740
and you're trying to from the moments
 

1975
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:07,559

00:47:07,559 --> 00:47:07,569
that weren't flowed you're trying to
 

1977
00:47:07,569 --> 00:47:09,120
that weren't flowed you're trying to
come back and look at and say what what

1978
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:09,130
come back and look at and say what what
 

1979
00:47:09,130 --> 00:47:09,750
come back and look at and say what what
did I do

1980
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:09,760
did I do
 

1981
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,180
did I do
how did it how did that happen or was in

1982
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:12,190
how did it how did that happen or was in
 

1983
00:47:12,190 --> 00:47:14,700
how did it how did that happen or was in
my mind you know but I think it's just a

1984
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:14,710
my mind you know but I think it's just a
 

1985
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:16,829
my mind you know but I think it's just a
process of over and over and over and

1986
00:47:16,829 --> 00:47:16,839
process of over and over and over and
 

1987
00:47:16,839 --> 00:47:20,520
process of over and over and over and
over until finally it gets a little bit

1988
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:20,530
over until finally it gets a little bit
 

1989
00:47:20,530 --> 00:47:24,089
over until finally it gets a little bit
easier and did you did you always when

1990
00:47:24,089 --> 00:47:24,099
easier and did you did you always when
 

1991
00:47:24,099 --> 00:47:25,579
easier and did you did you always when
you when you read something you write

1992
00:47:25,579 --> 00:47:25,589
you when you read something you write
 

1993
00:47:25,589 --> 00:47:28,200
you when you read something you write
did you always have a pretty good radar

1994
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:28,210
did you always have a pretty good radar
 

1995
00:47:28,210 --> 00:47:31,589
did you always have a pretty good radar
for what's good enough after it's

1996
00:47:31,589 --> 00:47:31,599
for what's good enough after it's
 

1997
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:41,250
for what's good enough after it's
written no I think I do now but but no

written no I think I do now but but no
it was always really hard for me to know

2000
00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:43,329
it was always really hard for me to know
 

2001
00:47:43,329 --> 00:47:47,099
it was always really hard for me to know
what was good I mean do you edit the

Gandhi and that's of course why they all
 

2389
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:50,620
Gandhi and that's of course why they all
wind up getting assassinated

2390

make a sacrifice to help others it's
 

2483
00:59:11,830 --> 00:59:14,250
make a sacrifice to help others it's
letting go of that fear is what leads

2484
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:14,260
letting go of that fear is what leads
 

2485
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:18,000
letting go of that fear is what leads
the productivity into success yeah

2486
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:18,010
the productivity into success yeah
 

2487
00:59:18,010 --> 00:59:22,530
the productivity into success yeah
do you think there's a it that's

2488
00:59:22,530 --> 00:59:22,540
do you think there's a it that's
 

2489
00:59:22,540 --> 00:59:24,859
do you think there's a it that's
probably the answer is either obvious or

2490
00:59:24,859 --> 00:59:24,869
probably the answer is either obvious or
 

2491
00:59:24,869 --> 00:59:27,060
probably the answer is either obvious or
impossible but do you think there's an

2492
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:27,070
impossible but do you think there's an
 

2493
00:59:27,070 --> 00:59:30,590
impossible but do you think there's an
evolutionary advantage to resistance

2494
00:59:30,590 --> 00:59:30,600
evolutionary advantage to resistance
 

2495
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:34,560
evolutionary advantage to resistance
like what would life look like without

2496
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:34,570
like what would life look like without
 

2497
00:59:34,570 --> 00:59:37,680
like what would life look like without
resistance that sort of that's another

2498
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:37,690
resistance that sort of that's another
 

2499
00:59:37,690 --> 00:59:40,350
resistance that sort of that's another
great question I think I also believe

2500
00:59:40,350 --> 00:59:40,360
great question I think I also believe
 

2501
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:43,560
great question I think I also believe
that resistance like death gives a

2502
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:43,570
that resistance like death gives a
 

2503
00:59:43,570 --> 00:59:45,570
that resistance like death gives a
meaning to life right if we didn't have

2504
00:59:45,570 --> 00:59:45,580
meaning to life right if we didn't have
 

2505
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:49,170
meaning to life right if we didn't have
it it's gonna be you know what would we

2506
00:59:49,170 --> 00:59:49,180
it it's gonna be you know what would we
 

2507
00:59:49,180 --> 00:59:51,420
it it's gonna be you know what would we
be we'd be in the Garden of Eden picking

2508
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:51,430
be we'd be in the Garden of Eden picking
 

2509
00:59:51,430 --> 00:59:55,670
be we'd be in the Garden of Eden picking
fruit and just happy and stupid you know

2510
00:59:55,670 --> 00:59:55,680
fruit and just happy and stupid you know
 

2511
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:58,230
fruit and just happy and stupid you know
and I do think that that myth of the

2512
00:59:58,230 --> 00:59:58,240
and I do think that that myth of the
 

2513
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:00,270
and I do think that that myth of the
Garden of Eden is really about this kind

2514
01:00:00,270 --> 01:00:00,280
Garden of Eden is really about this kind
 

2515
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:02,460
Garden of Eden is really about this kind
of thing you know where where Adam and

2516
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:02,470
of thing you know where where Adam and
 

2517
01:00:02,470 --> 01:00:04,800
of thing you know where where Adam and
Eve decide to sort of take matters into

2518
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:04,810
Eve decide to sort of take matters into
 

2519
01:00:04,810 --> 01:00:08,849
Eve decide to sort of take matters into
their own hands and and acquire

2520
01:00:08,849 --> 01:00:08,859
their own hands and and acquire
 

2521
01:00:08,859 --> 01:00:11,970
their own hands and and acquire
knowledge that until then God had said

2522
01:00:11,970 --> 01:00:11,980
knowledge that until then God had said
 

2523
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:13,560
knowledge that until then God had said
I'm the only one that's got that

2524
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:13,570
I'm the only one that's got that
 

2525
01:00:13,570 --> 01:00:16,200
I'm the only one that's got that
knowledge and of course once they have

2526
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:16,210
knowledge and of course once they have
 

2527
01:00:16,210 --> 01:00:18,720
knowledge and of course once they have
acquired that knowledge they're cast out

2528
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:18,730
acquired that knowledge they're cast out
 

2529
01:00:18,730 --> 01:00:20,690
acquired that knowledge they're cast out
into the world you and I live in now

2530
01:00:20,690 --> 01:00:20,700
into the world you and I live in now
 

2531
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,800
into the world you and I live in now
where they do have to deal with that

2532
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:22,810
where they do have to deal with that
 

2533
01:00:22,810 --> 01:00:24,359
where they do have to deal with that
fear and they do have to deal with all

2534
01:00:24,359 --> 01:00:24,369
fear and they do have to deal with all
 

2535
01:00:24,369 --> 01:00:27,599
fear and they do have to deal with all
that stuff is the human condition the

2536
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:27,609
that stuff is the human condition the
 

2537
01:00:27,609 --> 01:00:30,150
that stuff is the human condition the
human condition and the meaning and the

2538
01:00:30,150 --> 01:00:30,160
human condition and the meaning and the
 

2539
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:35,460
human condition and the meaning and the
purpose comes from the resistance being

2540
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:35,470
purpose comes from the resistance being
 

2541
01:00:35,470 --> 01:00:38,490
purpose comes from the resistance being
there and the struggle to overcome it

2542
01:00:38,490 --> 01:00:38,500
there and the struggle to overcome it
 

2543
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:40,470
there and the struggle to overcome it
the overcoming right that's and also the

2544
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:40,480
the overcoming right that's and also the
 

2545
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:44,190
the overcoming right that's and also the
other aspect of it is that it's not real

2546
01:00:44,190 --> 01:00:44,200
other aspect of it is that it's not real
 

2547
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:47,460
other aspect of it is that it's not real
at all it's not even like it's an actual

2548
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:47,470
at all it's not even like it's an actual
 

2549
01:00:47,470 --> 01:00:51,840
at all it's not even like it's an actual
force it's all here right so the the

2550
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:51,850
force it's all here right so the the
 

2551
01:00:51,850 --> 01:00:56,609
force it's all here right so the the
sort of in a way it's sort of a

sort of in a way it's sort of a
 

2553
01:00:56,619 --> 01:01:03,019
sort of in a way it's sort of a

2554
01:01:03,019 --> 01:01:03,029
surrender to it you know you know or
 

2555
01:01:03,029 --> 01:01:05,579
surrender to it you know you know or
like turning on the light in a dark

2556
01:01:05,579 --> 01:01:05,589
like turning on the light in a dark
 

2557
01:01:05,589 --> 01:01:10,470
like turning on the light in a dark
thing it's like it's gone but not quite

thing it's like it's gone but not quite
 

2559
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:11,849
thing it's like it's gone but not quite
because it's not quite because it comes

2560
01:01:11,849 --> 01:01:11,859
because it's not quite because it comes
 

2561

01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:19,450
every day so what's been uh maybe
 

2567
01:01:19,450 --> 01:01:21,329
every day so what's been uh maybe
recently but in general maybe you know

01:01:21,329 --> 01:01:21,339
recently but in general maybe you know
 

2569
01:01:21,339 --> 01:01:24,210
recently but in general maybe you know
life what's been the most relentless or

one of the more relentless sources of
 

2573
01:01:26,049 --> 01:01:28,769
one of the more relentless sources of
resistance to you personally I mean it's

2574
01:01:28,769 --> 01:01:28,779
resistance to you personally I mean it's
 

2575
01:01:28,779 --> 01:01:31,799
resistance to you personally I mean it's
always the same it's about writing for

2576
01:01:31,799 --> 01:01:31,809
always the same it's about writing for
 

2577
01:01:31,809 --> 01:01:37,769
always the same it's about writing for
me and an evolving within my own body of

work you know it never goes away it
 

2581
01:01:42,609 --> 01:01:44,999
work you know it never goes away it
never gets any less you have particular

never gets any less you have particular
 

2583
01:01:45,009 --> 01:01:48,930
never gets any less you have particular

2584
01:01:48,930 --> 01:01:48,940
excuses particular justifications that
 

2585
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:52,349
excuses particular justifications that
come out no it's always the same well I

2586
01:01:52,349 --> 01:01:52,359
come out no it's always the same well I
 

2587
01:01:52,359 --> 01:01:54,089
come out no it's always the same well I
would say it's always its same but it's

2588
01:01:54,089 --> 01:01:54,099
would say it's always its same but it's
 

2589
01:01:54,099 --> 01:01:55,730
would say it's always its same but it's
really not because resistance is so

2590
01:01:55,730 --> 01:01:55,740
really not because resistance is so
 

2591
01:01:55,740 --> 01:01:58,470
really not because resistance is so
protein you know it keeps changing form

2592
01:01:58,470 --> 01:01:58,480
protein you know it keeps changing form
 

2593
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:01,739
protein you know it keeps changing form
and as you as you move to hopefully a

2594
01:02:01,739 --> 01:02:01,749
and as you as you move to hopefully a
 

2595
01:02:01,749 --> 01:02:04,140
and as you as you move to hopefully a
higher level resistance gets a little

2596
01:02:04,140 --> 01:02:04,150
higher level resistance gets a little
 

2597
01:02:04,150 --> 01:02:05,759
higher level resistance gets a little
more nuanced and a little more subtle

2598
01:02:05,759 --> 01:02:05,769
more nuanced and a little more subtle
 

2599
01:02:05,769 --> 01:02:10,470
more nuanced and a little more subtle
trying to fake you out but I think you

2600
01:02:10,470 --> 01:02:10,480
trying to fake you out but I think you
 

2601
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:12,180
trying to fake you out but I think you
learn that it's always there and you're

2602
01:02:12,180 --> 01:02:12,190
learn that it's always there and you're
 

2603
01:02:12,190 --> 01:02:13,380
learn that it's always there and you're
always gonna have to face it

2604
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:13,390
always gonna have to face it
 

2605
01:02:13,390 --> 01:02:17,180
always gonna have to face it
so I mean you're but your battle is

2606
01:02:17,180 --> 01:02:17,190
so I mean you're but your battle is
 

2607
01:02:17,190 --> 01:02:21,059
so I mean you're but your battle is
sitting down and writing to some number

2608
01:02:21,059 --> 01:02:21,069
sitting down and writing to some number
 

2609
01:02:21,069 --> 01:02:24,720
sitting down and writing to some number
Awards to a blank page yeah give a

2610
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:24,730
Awards to a blank page yeah give a
 

2611
01:02:24,730 --> 01:02:28,319
Awards to a blank page yeah give a
process there with his battle you have a

2612
01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:28,329
process there with his battle you have a
 

2613
01:02:28,329 --> 01:02:31,620
process there with his battle you have a
number of hours you put end honestly

2614
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:31,630
number of hours you put end honestly
 

2615
01:02:31,630 --> 01:02:34,890
number of hours you put end honestly
yeah I'm definitely a a believer that

2616
01:02:34,890 --> 01:02:34,900
yeah I'm definitely a a believer that
 

2617
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:37,620
yeah I'm definitely a a believer that
even though this battle is fought on the

2618
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:37,630
even though this battle is fought on the
 

2619
01:02:37,630 --> 01:02:40,470
even though this battle is fought on the
highest sort of spiritual level that the

2620
01:02:40,470 --> 01:02:40,480
highest sort of spiritual level that the
 

2621
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:43,160
highest sort of spiritual level that the
way you fight it is on the most mundane

2622
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:43,170
way you fight it is on the most mundane
 

2623
01:02:43,170 --> 01:02:46,019
way you fight it is on the most mundane
I'm sure it's like martial arts must be

2624
01:02:46,019 --> 01:02:46,029
I'm sure it's like martial arts must be
 

2625
01:02:46,029 --> 01:02:47,729
I'm sure it's like martial arts must be
the same way I mean I go to the gym

2626
01:02:47,729 --> 01:02:47,739
the same way I mean I go to the gym
 

2627
01:02:47,739 --> 01:02:50,880
the same way I mean I go to the gym
first thing in the morning and I sort of

2628
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:50,890
first thing in the morning and I sort of
 

2629
01:02:50,890 --> 01:02:55,079
first thing in the morning and I sort of
am rehearsing myself faced you know the

2630
01:02:55,079 --> 01:02:55,089
am rehearsing myself faced you know the
 

2631
01:02:55,089 --> 01:02:56,759
am rehearsing myself faced you know the
gym is called resistance training right

2632
01:02:56,759 --> 01:02:56,769
gym is called resistance training right
 

2633
01:02:56,769 --> 01:02:58,739
gym is called resistance training right
you're working against resistance right

2634
01:02:58,739 --> 01:02:58,749
you're working against resistance right
 

2635
01:02:58,749 --> 01:03:00,900
you're working against resistance right
yeah and I don't want to go I don't want

2636
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:00,910
yeah and I don't want to go I don't want
 

2637
01:03:00,910 --> 01:03:03,380
yeah and I don't want to go I don't want
to get out of bed I hate that you know

2638
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:03,390

2639
01:03:03,390 --> 01:03:06,779
to get out of bed I hate that you know
so but I'm sort of fortifying myself to

2640
01:03:06,779 --> 01:03:06,789
so but I'm sort of fortifying myself to
 

2641
01:03:06,789 --> 01:03:11,279
so but I'm sort of fortifying myself to
to be ready for the day and you know

2642
01:03:11,279 --> 01:03:11,289
to be ready for the day and you know
 

2643
01:03:11,289 --> 01:03:13,589
to be ready for the day and you know
like I said over not would over years

2644
01:03:13,589 --> 01:03:13,599
like I said over not would over years
 

2645
01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:15,340
like I said over not would over years
I've learned to sort of

2646
01:03:15,340 --> 01:03:15,350
I've learned to sort of
 

2647
01:03:15,350 --> 01:03:17,200
I've learned to sort of
get into the right kind of mindset and

2648
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:17,210
get into the right kind of mindset and
 

2649
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:19,260
get into the right kind of mindset and
it's not as hard for me as it used to be

2650
01:03:19,260 --> 01:03:19,270
it's not as hard for me as it used to be
 

2651
01:03:19,270 --> 01:03:22,360
it's not as hard for me as it used to be
the real resistance I think for me and I

2652
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:22,370
the real resistance I think for me and I
 

2653
01:03:22,370 --> 01:03:24,940
the real resistance I think for me and I
think this is true for anybody is the

2654
01:03:24,940 --> 01:03:24,950
think this is true for anybody is the
 

2655
01:03:24,950 --> 01:03:27,030
think this is true for anybody is the
question of sort of what's the next idea

2656
01:03:27,030 --> 01:03:27,040
question of sort of what's the next idea
 

2657
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:29,710
question of sort of what's the next idea
what's the next book what's the next

2658
01:03:29,710 --> 01:03:29,720
what's the next book what's the next
 

2659
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:31,630
what's the next book what's the next
project that you're going to work on and

2660
01:03:31,630 --> 01:03:31,640
project that you're going to work on and
 

2661
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:33,940
project that you're going to work on and
when I when I ask that question I'm

2662
01:03:33,940 --> 01:03:33,950
when I when I ask that question I'm
 

2663
01:03:33,950 --> 01:03:36,220
when I when I ask that question I'm
sorry I'm asking it of the muse I'm kind

that you know because that that body of
 

2683
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:05,460
that you know because that that body of
work is already alive it already exists

01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:05,470
work is already alive it already exists
 

2685
01:04:05,470 --> 01:04:08,890
work is already alive it already exists
inside us canonical woman's biological

2686
01:04:08,890 --> 01:04:08,900
inside us canonical woman's biological
 

2687
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:12,880
inside us canonical woman's biological
clock and we have to serve it and we

2688
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:12,890
clock and we have to serve it and we
 

2689
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:15,580
clock and we have to serve it and we
have to otherwise it'll give us cancer

2690
01:04:15,580 --> 01:04:15,590
have to otherwise it'll give us cancer
 

2691
01:04:15,590 --> 01:04:18,610
have to otherwise it'll give us cancer
you know I don't mean to say that if

2692
01:04:18,610 --> 01:04:18,620
you know I don't mean to say that if
 

2693
01:04:18,620 --> 01:04:20,410
you know I don't mean to say that if
anybody has cancer that they're not yeah

2694
01:04:20,410 --> 01:04:20,420
anybody has cancer that they're not yeah
 

2695
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:22,060
anybody has cancer that they're not yeah
but you know what I mean it'll it'll do

2696
01:04:22,060 --> 01:04:22,070
but you know what I mean it'll it'll do
 

2697
01:04:22,070 --> 01:04:24,400
but you know what I mean it'll it'll do
it'll take it's a revenge on us so the

2698
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:24,410
it'll take it's a revenge on us so the
 

2699
01:04:24,410 --> 01:04:26,370
it'll take it's a revenge on us so the
next of the resistance to me is sort of

2700
01:04:26,370 --> 01:04:26,380
next of the resistance to me is sort of
 

2701
01:04:26,380 --> 01:04:29,320
next of the resistance to me is sort of
well a big aspect of it is what's next

2702
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:29,330
well a big aspect of it is what's next
 

2703
01:04:29,330 --> 01:04:31,270
well a big aspect of it is what's next
you know when I finish the book I'm

2704
01:04:31,270 --> 01:04:31,280
you know when I finish the book I'm
 

2705
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:32,440
you know when I finish the book I'm
working on now I'm not sure what I'm

2706
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:32,450
working on now I'm not sure what I'm
 

2707
01:04:32,450 --> 01:04:33,100
working on now I'm not sure what I'm
gonna do next

2708
01:04:33,100 --> 01:04:33,110
gonna do next
 

2709
01:04:33,110 --> 01:04:35,050
gonna do next
and I see at the same time you have a

2710
01:04:35,050 --> 01:04:35,060
and I see at the same time you have a
 

2711
01:04:35,060 --> 01:04:40,050
and I see at the same time you have a
kind of you have a sense that there is a

2712
01:04:40,050 --> 01:04:40,060
kind of you have a sense that there is a
 

2713
01:04:40,060 --> 01:04:45,610
kind of you have a sense that there is a
Bruce Springsteen single line of albums

2714
01:04:45,610 --> 01:04:45,620
Bruce Springsteen single line of albums
 

2715
01:04:45,620 --> 01:04:48,100
Bruce Springsteen single line of albums
so like it's it's already known

2716
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:48,110
so like it's it's already known
 

2717
01:04:48,110 --> 01:04:49,720
so like it's it's already known
somewhere in the universe what you're

2718
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:49,730
somewhere in the universe what you're
 

2719
01:04:49,730 --> 01:04:51,730
somewhere in the universe what you're
going to do next is the sense you have

2720
01:04:51,730 --> 01:04:51,740
going to do next is the sense you have
 

2721
01:04:51,740 --> 01:04:53,920
going to do next is the sense you have
in it in a sense yes I don't know if

2722
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:53,930
in it in a sense yes I don't know if
 

2723
01:04:53,930 --> 01:04:56,110
in it in a sense yes I don't know if
it's like predetermined you know but

2724
01:04:56,110 --> 01:04:56,120
it's like predetermined you know but
 

2725
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:59,400
it's like predetermined you know but
it's but there's something like that

2726
01:04:59,400 --> 01:04:59,410
it's but there's something like that
 

2727
01:04:59,410 --> 01:05:02,550
it's but there's something like that
yeah I'd like to believe that there's uh

2728
01:05:02,550 --> 01:05:02,560
yeah I'd like to believe that there's uh
 

2729
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:04,930
yeah I'd like to believe that there's uh
was this kind of like quantum mechanics

2730
01:05:04,930 --> 01:05:04,940
was this kind of like quantum mechanics
 

2731
01:05:04,940 --> 01:05:08,920
was this kind of like quantum mechanics
I guess once once you observe it maybe

2732
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:08,930
I guess once once you observe it maybe
 

2733
01:05:08,930 --> 01:05:12,160
I guess once once you observe it maybe
once you talk to the muse it's it's it's

2734
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:12,170
once you talk to the muse it's it's it's
 

2735
01:05:12,170 --> 01:05:14,200
once you talk to the muse it's it's it's
one thing for sure it was always going

2736
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:14,210
one thing for sure it was always going
 

2737
01:05:14,210 --> 01:05:16,470
one thing for sure it was always going
to be that one thing but really in

2738
01:05:16,470 --> 01:05:16,480
to be that one thing but really in
 

2739
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:19,570
to be that one thing but really in
reality it's a distribution it could be

2740
01:05:19,570 --> 01:05:19,580
reality it's a distribution it could be
 

2741
01:05:19,580 --> 01:05:21,430
reality it's a distribution it could be
any number of things yeah I think so

2742
01:05:21,430 --> 01:05:21,440
any number of things yeah I think so
 

2743
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:23,200
any number of things yeah I think so
there's an alternate reality alternate

2744
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:23,210
there's an alternate reality alternate
 

2745
01:05:23,210 --> 01:05:25,540
there's an alternate reality alternate
realities they're not that far apart I

2746
01:05:25,540 --> 01:05:25,550
realities they're not that far apart I
 

2747
01:05:25,550 --> 01:05:27,220
realities they're not that far apart I
mean Bruce Springsteen is not gonna

2748
01:05:27,220 --> 01:05:27,230
mean Bruce Springsteen is not gonna
 

2749
01:05:27,230 --> 01:05:29,200
mean Bruce Springsteen is not gonna
write you know a Joni Mitchell

2750
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:29,210
write you know a Joni Mitchell
 

2751
01:05:29,210 --> 01:05:31,450
write you know a Joni Mitchell
you know no matter how hard he's

2752
01:05:31,450 --> 01:05:31,460
you know no matter how hard he's
 

2753
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:32,829
you know no matter how hard he's
probably when I'm brought I mean he

2754
01:05:32,829 --> 01:05:32,839
probably when I'm brought I mean he
 

2755
01:05:32,839 --> 01:05:35,049
probably when I'm brought I mean he
still did that which is not a Bruce

2756
01:05:35,049 --> 01:05:35,059
still did that which is not a Bruce
 

2757
01:05:35,059 --> 01:05:37,420
still did that which is not a Bruce
Springsteen thing to do so I think I

2758
01:05:37,420 --> 01:05:37,430
Springsteen thing to do so I think I
 

2759
01:05:37,430 --> 01:05:40,030
Springsteen thing to do so I think I
think you're being in retrospect I think

2760
01:05:40,030 --> 01:05:40,040
think you're being in retrospect I think
 

2761
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:42,430
think you're being in retrospect I think
it is making things you know it's a next

2762
01:05:42,430 --> 01:05:42,440
it is making things you know it's a next
 

2763
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:44,680
it is making things you know it's a next
sort of evolution form why not take his

2764
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:44,690
sort of evolution form why not take his
 

2765
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:47,770
sort of evolution form why not take his
music to there you know in retrospect it

2766
01:05:47,770 --> 01:05:47,780
music to there you know in retrospect it
 

2767
01:05:47,780 --> 01:05:51,069
music to there you know in retrospect it
all makes sense I think yeah because he

2768
01:05:51,069 --> 01:05:51,079
all makes sense I think yeah because he
 

2769
01:05:51,079 --> 01:05:54,309
all makes sense I think yeah because he
if you pull it off especially do you

2770
01:05:54,309 --> 01:05:54,319
if you pull it off especially do you
 

2771
01:05:54,319 --> 01:05:56,670
if you pull it off especially do you
visualize yourself completing the work

2772
01:05:56,670 --> 01:05:56,680
visualize yourself completing the work
 

2773
01:05:56,680 --> 01:06:00,069
visualize yourself completing the work
like Olympic athletes visualize getting

2774
01:06:00,069 --> 01:06:00,079
like Olympic athletes visualize getting
 

2775
01:06:00,079 --> 01:06:03,370
like Olympic athletes visualize getting
the gold medal do you

2776
01:06:03,370 --> 01:06:03,380
the gold medal do you
 

2777
01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:05,500
the gold medal do you
you know they that's they go through I

2778
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:05,510
you know they that's they go through I
 

2779
01:06:05,510 --> 01:06:08,530
you know they that's they go through I
mean that's actually a really you can

2780
01:06:08,530 --> 01:06:08,540
mean that's actually a really you can
 

2781
01:06:08,540 --> 01:06:10,000
mean that's actually a really you can
learn something from athletes on that is

2782
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:10,010
learn something from athletes on that is
 

2783
01:06:10,010 --> 01:06:14,589
learn something from athletes on that is
um years out certainly two three years

2784

to get at this balance between health
 

3165
01:15:03,570 --> 01:15:06,860
to get at this balance between health
and obsessively working at something and

3166
01:15:06,860 --> 01:15:06,870
and obsessively working at something and

when I'm a little bit torn to me passion
 

3173

and reason do not overlap much or at all
 

3175
01:15:17,670 --> 01:15:20,210
and reason do not overlap much or at all
sometimes maybe I'm being too rushing

3176
01:15:20,210 --> 01:15:20,220
sometimes maybe I'm being too rushing
 

3177
01:15:20,220 --> 01:15:25,160
sometimes maybe I'm being too rushing
but I feel madness and obsession does

3178
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:25,170
but I feel madness and obsession does

everything should just go to hell where
 

3191
01:15:41,100 --> 01:15:43,220
everything should just go to hell where

01:15:43,220 --> 01:15:43,230
do you stand on this balance how
 

3193
01:15:43,230 --> 01:15:45,410
do you stand on this balance how
important is health for productivity how

3194
01:15:45,410 --> 01:15:45,420
important is health for productivity how
 

3195
01:15:45,420 --> 01:15:48,020
important is health for productivity how
important is it to sort of get sleep and

hours of music time needed for truly
 

3317
01:18:26,780 --> 01:18:29,290
hours of music time needed for truly
genius ideas but it's uh it's something

3481
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:10,010
working on so when I'm I've got pages

them afresh as I as I go through the
 

3485
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:17,090
them afresh as I as I go through the
story so it's not quite where I am now

3486
01:22:17,090 --> 01:22:17,100
story so it's not quite where I am now
 

3487
01:22:17,100 --> 01:22:21,020
story so it's not quite where I am now
it's not quite a deep muse scenario

3488
01:22:21,020 --> 01:22:21,030
it's not quite a deep muse scenario
 

3489
01:22:21,030 --> 01:22:24,350
it's not quite a deep muse scenario
partly it is but it's also sort of

3490
01:22:24,350 --> 01:22:24,360
partly it is but it's also sort of
 

3491
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:26,419
partly it is but it's also sort of
bouncing back and forth between the

3492
01:22:26,419 --> 01:22:26,429
bouncing back and forth between the
 

3493
01:22:26,429 --> 01:22:27,890
bouncing back and forth between the
different between the right brain and

3494
01:22:27,890 --> 01:22:27,900
different between the right brain and
 

3495
01:22:27,900 --> 01:22:29,330
different between the right brain and
the left brain I'm kind of looking at it

3496
01:22:29,330 --> 01:22:29,340
the left brain I'm kind of looking at it
 

3497
01:22:29,340 --> 01:22:32,630
the left brain I'm kind of looking at it
and trying to evaluate it then I'm going

3498
01:22:32,630 --> 01:22:32,640
and trying to evaluate it then I'm going
 

3499
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:34,370
and trying to evaluate it then I'm going
into it and try to change it a little

3500
01:22:34,370 --> 01:22:34,380
into it and try to change it a little
 

3501
01:22:34,380 --> 01:22:38,149
into it and try to change it a little
bit when uh do you know sit down

3502
01:22:38,149 --> 01:22:38,159
bit when uh do you know sit down
 

3503

01:22:41,429 --> 01:22:44,479
do you know the night before of what
that starting point is yeah I always try

3506
01:22:44,479 --> 01:22:44,489
that starting point is yeah I always try
 

3507
01:22:44,489 --> 01:22:47,120
that starting point is yeah I always try
to stop and I learned this I think

3508
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:47,130
to stop and I learned this I think
 

3509
01:22:47,130 --> 01:22:48,709
to stop and I learned this I think
Hemingway wrote about this or done

3510
01:22:48,709 --> 01:22:48,719
Hemingway wrote about this or done
 

3511

Hemingway wrote about this or done
Steinbeck or one of the or maybe both of

01:22:50,509 --> 01:22:50,519
Steinbeck or one of the or maybe both of
 

3513
01:22:50,519 --> 01:22:53,000
Steinbeck or one of the or maybe both of
them to always stop when you kind of

3514
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:53,010
them to always stop when you kind of
 

3515
01:22:53,010 --> 01:22:55,399
them to always stop when you kind of
know what's coming next so you're not

3516
01:22:55,399 --> 01:22:55,409
know what's coming next so you're not
 

3517

3523
01:23:04,169 --> 01:23:05,719
the office is closed offices closed I
let the muse take care of it you know I

3524

3525
01:23:05,729 --> 01:23:07,699
let the muse take care of it you know I
don't know I don't want to and I think

3526
01:23:07,699 --> 01:23:07,709

3527
01:23:07,709 --> 01:23:10,339
don't know I don't want to and I think
it's a very unhealthy thing to worry

3528
01:23:10,339 --> 01:23:10,349
it's a very unhealthy thing to worry
 

3529
01:23:10,349 --> 01:23:12,620
it's a very unhealthy thing to worry
about it or think about any creative

3530
01:23:12,620 --> 01:23:12,630
about it or think about any creative
 

3531
01:23:12,630 --> 01:23:17,149
about it or think about any creative
process you don't I got a long walk

3532
01:23:17,149 --> 01:23:17,159
process you don't I got a long walk
 

3533
01:23:17,159 --> 01:23:20,299
process you don't I got a long walk
later think about yeah if that then I

3534
01:23:20,299 --> 01:23:20,309
later think about yeah if that then I
 

3535
01:23:20,309 --> 01:23:22,339
later think about yeah if that then I
will sort of keep my mind open to it but

3536
01:23:22,339 --> 01:23:22,349
will sort of keep my mind open to it but
 

3537
01:23:22,349 --> 01:23:24,589
will sort of keep my mind open to it but
I won't be like obsessing about it yeah

3538
01:23:24,589 --> 01:23:24,599
I won't be like obsessing about it yeah
 

3539
01:23:24,599 --> 01:23:27,109
I won't be like obsessing about it yeah
there's a actually on walks sometimes
