certainly the research part itself right
is over three thousand so it's not that

pretty unprecedented actually for that
 

291
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,350
pretty unprecedented actually for that
many Trends to be at one time and I used

many Trends to be at one time and I used
to say to people go faster go faster go

294
00:05:37,969 --> 00:05:37,979
to say to people go faster go faster go
 

295
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:41,270

00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:05,880
you know you've got hiking boots and
 

321
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,370
you know you've got hiking boots and
they're like no go run a marathon you're

322
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:07,380
they're like no go run a marathon you're
 

323
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:10,430
they're like no go run a marathon you're
like I can't do it in those boots but so

324
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:10,440
like I can't do it in those boots but so
 

325
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,950
like I can't do it in those boots but so
you've got to do something and at first

326
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:12,960
you've got to do something and at first
 

327
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,230
you've got to do something and at first
I think the ways for big companies I

328
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:15,240
I think the ways for big companies I
 

329
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,390
I think the ways for big companies I
would call them like blunt clubs you do

330
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:17,400
would call them like blunt clubs you do
 

331
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,010
would call them like blunt clubs you do
what everyone does you reduce layers

332
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:19,020
what everyone does you reduce layers
 

333
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,930
what everyone does you reduce layers
because if you reduce layers decisions

334
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:20,940
because if you reduce layers decisions
 

335
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,629
because if you reduce layers decisions
go faster there's just it's math if

336
00:06:23,629 --> 00:06:23,639
go faster there's just it's math if
 

337
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:25,309
go faster there's just it's math if
there's less decision points things go

338
00:06:25,309 --> 00:06:25,319
there's less decision points things go
 

339
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:27,170
there's less decision points things go
faster

340
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:27,180
faster
 

341
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,210
faster
um you do the blunt Club thing and then

342
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:29,220
um you do the blunt Club thing and then
 

343
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,490
um you do the blunt Club thing and then
after that though it did lead me down a

344
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:31,500
after that though it did lead me down a
 

345
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,010
after that though it did lead me down a
you know a long journey of they sound

346
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:34,020
you know a long journey of they sound
 

347
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,689
you know a long journey of they sound
like buzzwords but if you really do them

348
00:06:35,689 --> 00:06:35,699
like buzzwords but if you really do them
 

349
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:37,670
like buzzwords but if you really do them
at scale they're hard around things like

350
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:37,680
at scale they're hard around things like
 

351
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,749
at scale they're hard around things like
agile

352
00:06:38,749 --> 00:06:38,759
agile
 

353
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:41,270
agile
and um because you've really got to

354
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:41,280
and um because you've really got to
 

355
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,969
and um because you've really got to
change the way work gets done and we

356
00:06:43,969 --> 00:06:43,979
change the way work gets done and we
 

357
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:46,070
change the way work gets done and we
ended up training God hundreds of

358
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:46,080
ended up training God hundreds of
 

359
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,529
ended up training God hundreds of
thousands of people on that stuff change

360
00:06:48,529 --> 00:06:48,539
thousands of people on that stuff change
 

361
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:50,450
thousands of people on that stuff change
it correctly on how to do it correctly

362
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:50,460
it correctly on how to do it correctly
 

363
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,890
it correctly on how to do it correctly
that's right versus because everybody

364
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:51,900
that's right versus because everybody
 

365
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,990
that's right versus because everybody
talks about it but the idea that you

366
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:54,000
talks about it but the idea that you
 

367
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,210
talks about it but the idea that you
would really have small

368
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:55,220
would really have small
 

369
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,710
would really have small
multi-disciplinary teams work from the

370
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:57,720
multi-disciplinary teams work from the
 

371
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,990
multi-disciplinary teams work from the
outside in set those sort of interim

372
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:00,000
outside in set those sort of interim
 

373
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,930
outside in set those sort of interim
steps you know take the feedback pivot

374
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:02,940
steps you know take the feedback pivot
 

375
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,150
steps you know take the feedback pivot
and then do it on not just products do

376
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:05,160
and then do it on not just products do
 

377
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,610
and then do it on not just products do
it on lots of things was it's a hard to

378
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:07,620
it on lots of things was it's a hard to
 

379
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,689
it on lots of things was it's a hard to
do at scale

380
00:07:08,689 --> 00:07:08,699
do at scale
 

381
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:10,070
do at scale
um people always say oh I got this agile

382
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:10,080
um people always say oh I got this agile
 

383
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,770
um people always say oh I got this agile
group over here 40 people but not when

384
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:12,780
group over here 40 people but not when
 

385
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:13,909
group over here 40 people but not when
you're a couple hundred thousand people

386
00:07:13,909 --> 00:07:13,919
you're a couple hundred thousand people
 

387
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,590
you're a couple hundred thousand people
you gotta get a lot of people to work

388
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:15,600
you gotta get a lot of people to work
 

389
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,210
you gotta get a lot of people to work
that way the blunt Club thing you're

390
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:17,220
that way the blunt Club thing you're
 

391
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,710
that way the blunt Club thing you're
talking about so flatten the

392
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:18,720
talking about so flatten the
 

393
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,210
talking about so flatten the
organization as much as possible yeah

394
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:20,220
organization as much as possible yeah
 

395
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,650
organization as much as possible yeah
yeah I probably reduce the layers of

396
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:21,660
yeah I probably reduce the layers of
 

397
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:25,550
yeah I probably reduce the layers of
management by half and so it that does

398
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:25,560
management by half and so it that does
 

399
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,710
management by half and so it that does
that has lots of benefits right time to

400
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:27,720
that has lots of benefits right time to
 

401
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,270
that has lots of benefits right time to
a decision

402
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:29,280
a decision
 

403
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,370
a decision
um more autonomy to people because and

404
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:31,380
um more autonomy to people because and
 

405
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,550
um more autonomy to people because and
then the idea of like faster Clarity of

406
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:34,560
then the idea of like faster Clarity of
 

407
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,529
then the idea of like faster Clarity of
of where you're going because you're not

408
00:07:36,529 --> 00:07:36,539
of where you're going because you're not
 

409
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:37,909
of where you're going because you're not
just filtered through so many different

410
00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:37,919
just filtered through so many different
 

411
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,150
just filtered through so many different
layers and I think it's the kind of

412
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:41,160
layers and I think it's the kind of
 

413
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,529
layers and I think it's the kind of
thing a lot of companies if you're big

414
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:42,539
thing a lot of companies if you're big
 

415
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:44,089
thing a lot of companies if you're big
have to just keep going through it's

416
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:44,099
have to just keep going through it's
 

417
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:45,290
have to just keep going through it's
kind of like Grass Grows you know it

418
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:45,300
kind of like Grass Grows you know it
 

419
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,390
kind of like Grass Grows you know it
just comes back and you gotta go back

420
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:47,400
just comes back and you gotta go back
 

421
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,550
just comes back and you gotta go back
down and uh and work on it so it's a

422
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:49,560
down and uh and work on it so it's a
 

423
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,110
down and uh and work on it so it's a
natural thing

424
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:51,120
natural thing
 

425
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,790
natural thing
um but I hear so many people talk about

426
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:52,800
um but I hear so many people talk about
 

427
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,370
um but I hear so many people talk about
it like this idea of like okay well who

428
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:55,380
it like this idea of like okay well who
 

429
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,749
it like this idea of like okay well who
makes a decision you've often heard

430
00:07:56,749 --> 00:07:56,759
makes a decision you've often heard
 

431
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:58,309
makes a decision you've often heard
nobody can say yes and everybody can say

432
00:07:58,309 --> 00:07:58,319
nobody can say yes and everybody can say
 

433
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,589
nobody can say yes and everybody can say
no and that's actually what you're

434
00:08:00,589 --> 00:08:00,599
no and that's actually what you're
 

435
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:02,809
no and that's actually what you're
trying to get out of a system like that

436
00:08:02,809 --> 00:08:02,819
trying to get out of a system like that
 

437
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:04,249
trying to get out of a system like that
so

438
00:08:04,249 --> 00:08:04,259
so
 

439
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:07,430
so
I mean your book in general the way you

440
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:07,440
I mean your book in general the way you
 

441
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,770
I mean your book in general the way you
lead is very much about we and us you

442
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:09,780
lead is very much about we and us you
 

443
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,230
lead is very much about we and us you
know the the power of we but is there

444
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:12,240
know the the power of we but is there
 

445
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,029
know the the power of we but is there
times when a leader has to step in and

446
00:08:14,029 --> 00:08:14,039
times when a leader has to step in and
 

447
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:16,610
times when a leader has to step in and
be almost autocratic take control make

448
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:16,620
be almost autocratic take control make
 

449
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,830
be almost autocratic take control make
hard unpopular decisions oh I am sure

450
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:18,840
hard unpopular decisions oh I am sure
 

451
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,809
hard unpopular decisions oh I am sure
you know the answer to that and and it

452
00:08:20,809 --> 00:08:20,819
you know the answer to that and and it
 

453
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:22,809
you know the answer to that and and it
is of course yes

454
00:08:22,809 --> 00:08:22,819
is of course yes
 

455
00:08:22,819 --> 00:08:26,629
is of course yes
yeah you know because I actually

456
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:26,639
yeah you know because I actually
 

457
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,550
yeah you know because I actually
um a there's a leader for a time but

458
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:28,560
um a there's a leader for a time but
 

459
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,930
um a there's a leader for a time but
then there's a leader for a situation

460
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:29,940
then there's a leader for a situation
 

461
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:33,290
then there's a leader for a situation
right and so I've had to do plenty of

462
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:33,300
right and so I've had to do plenty of
 

463
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,850
right and so I've had to do plenty of
unpopular things I think anytime you

464
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:34,860
unpopular things I think anytime you
 

465
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,949
unpopular things I think anytime you
have to run a company that endures a

466
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:36,959
have to run a company that endures a
 

467
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:38,389
have to run a company that endures a
century and has to endure another

468
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:38,399
century and has to endure another
 

469
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,730
century and has to endure another
Century you will do unpopular things you

470
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:40,740
Century you will do unpopular things you
 

471
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,190
Century you will do unpopular things you
have no choice and I often felt I had to

472
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:43,200
have no choice and I often felt I had to
 

473
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,070
have no choice and I often felt I had to
sacrifice things for the long term and

474
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:46,080
sacrifice things for the long term and
 

475
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,050
sacrifice things for the long term and
whether that would have been you know

476
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:48,060
whether that would have been you know
 

477
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,910
whether that would have been you know

they call themselves an expert for a few
 

795
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,509
they call themselves an expert for a few
too many years so you have to have that

796
00:14:23,509 --> 00:14:23,519
too many years so you have to have that
 

797
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,910
too many years so you have to have that

809
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,990
path you know down the cloud and Ai and
we said and people say oh IBM you know

we said and people say oh IBM you know
 

811
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,750

and I sometimes say shiny objects
 

823
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,150
and I sometimes say shiny objects
trained in shiny objects come on in but

824

trained in shiny objects come on in but
 

825
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,889
trained in shiny objects come on in but
I saw something it was another one of

I saw something it was another one of
 

827
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:56,449
I saw something it was another one of
these you're not a shiny object I'm not

critical work and then break a bank I

842
00:15:11,269 --> 00:15:11,279
critical work and then break a bank I
 

843
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,530
critical work and then break a bank I
mean they would not understand the

844
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:12,540
mean they would not understand the
 

845
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,970
mean they would not understand the
certain kind of security and the

846
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:13,980
certain kind of security and the
 

847
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,530

auditability and everything they had to
 

849
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,310
auditability and everything they had to
go on and then I watched IBM people say

850
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:18,320
go on and then I watched IBM people say
 

851
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,569
go on and then I watched IBM people say
oh I actually could learn something some

852
00:15:20,569 --> 00:15:20,579
oh I actually could learn something some
 

853
00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:22,250
oh I actually could learn something some
were like yeah okay I don't know how to

do that's a really good thing I could
 

857
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:26,210
do that's a really good thing I could
learn and in the end there was not like

858
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:26,220
learn and in the end there was not like
 

859
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,710
learn and in the end there was not like
one group was a winner one was a loser

863
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,769
the winners were the people who were
willing to learn from each other I mean

864
00:15:30,769 --> 00:15:30,779
willing to learn from each other I mean
 

865
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:33,290
willing to learn from each other I mean
it was to me it was very Stark example

866
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:33,300
it was to me it was very Stark example
 

867
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,629
it was to me it was very Stark example
of that point and I and I saw it

868
00:15:35,629 --> 00:15:35,639
of that point and I and I saw it
 

869
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:38,030
of that point and I and I saw it
firsthand so that's why I'm so committed

870
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:38,040
firsthand so that's why I'm so committed
 

871
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,650
firsthand so that's why I'm so committed
to this idea about skills first and

872
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:39,660
to this idea about skills first and
 

873
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:40,910

that's how people should be hired
 

875
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:46,370

951
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:11,809
because
like a really flip answer would be

952
00:17:11,809 --> 00:17:11,819
like a really flip answer would be
 

953
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:15,409
like a really flip answer would be
as it gets bigger you have no choice but

954
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:15,419
as it gets bigger you have no choice but
 

955
00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:17,270
as it gets bigger you have no choice but
to just you know you can't do it you

956
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:17,280
to just you know you can't do it you
 

957
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,409
to just you know you can't do it you
have to

958
00:17:18,409 --> 00:17:18,419
have to
 

959
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:21,949
have to
you have to tell or show I mean

960
00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:21,959
you have to tell or show I mean
 

961
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:23,510
you have to tell or show I mean
you've got to let people find their way

962
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:23,520
you've got to let people find their way
 

963
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,270
you've got to let people find their way
because it's so big you can't right

964
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:26,280
because it's so big you can't right
 

965
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,069
because it's so big you can't right
that's an obvious answer scope of work

966
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:28,079
that's an obvious answer scope of work
 

967
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,470
that's an obvious answer scope of work
bigger it gets okay I've gotta let more

968
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:30,480
bigger it gets okay I've gotta let more
 

969
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,270
bigger it gets okay I've gotta let more
stuff go

970
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:32,280
stuff go
 

971
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,250
stuff go
but

972
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:34,260
but
 

973
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:37,970
but
I have always believed that a a Leader's

974
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:37,980
I have always believed that a a Leader's
 

975
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,669
I have always believed that a a Leader's
job is to do as well

976
00:17:40,669 --> 00:17:40,679
job is to do as well
 

977
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:43,669
job is to do as well
and I think there's like a few areas

978
00:17:43,669 --> 00:17:43,679
and I think there's like a few areas
 

979
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,130
and I think there's like a few areas
that are really important that you

980
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:46,140
that are really important that you
 

981
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,930
that are really important that you
always do now it doesn't meaning you're

982
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:47,940
always do now it doesn't meaning you're
 

983
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,930
always do now it doesn't meaning you're
showing so like when it has to do with

984
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:50,940
showing so like when it has to do with
 

985
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,450
showing so like when it has to do with
values and value-based decisions like I

986
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:53,460
values and value-based decisions like I
 

987
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,470
values and value-based decisions like I
think it's really important to

988
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:54,480
think it's really important to
 

989
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,150
think it's really important to
constantly

990
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:56,160
constantly
 

991
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,090
constantly
show people that you you walk your talk

992
00:17:59,090 --> 00:17:59,100
show people that you you walk your talk
 

993
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,850
show people that you you walk your talk
on that kind of thing is super important

994
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:01,860
on that kind of thing is super important
 

995
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,770
on that kind of thing is super important
and I actually think it's a struggle

996
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:03,780
and I actually think it's a struggle
 

997
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:06,110
and I actually think it's a struggle
young companies have because the values

998
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:06,120
young companies have because the values
 

999
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,150
young companies have because the values
aren't deeply rooted and when a storm

1000
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:08,160
aren't deeply rooted and when a storm
 

1001
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,750
aren't deeply rooted and when a storm
comes it's easy to uproot and

1002
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:11,760
comes it's easy to uproot and
 

1003
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,909
comes it's easy to uproot and
um so I always felt like when it was

1004
00:18:13,909 --> 00:18:13,919
um so I always felt like when it was
 

1005
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,070
um so I always felt like when it was
that time I showed it I got taught that

1006
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:16,080
that time I showed it I got taught that
 

1007
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,950
that time I showed it I got taught that
so young as at IBM and even General

1008
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:18,960
so young as at IBM and even General
 

1009
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,630
so young as at IBM and even General
Motors that

1010
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:20,640
Motors that
 

1011
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,230
Motors that
um

1012
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:21,240
um
 

1013
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,029
um
in fact I write I do write about that in

1014
00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:23,039
in fact I write I do write about that in
 

1015
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,610
in fact I write I do write about that in
the book first time I was a manager I

1016
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:25,620
the book first time I was a manager I
 

1017

had a gentleman telling dirty jokes and

1018
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:29,100

1019
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,730
had a gentleman telling dirty jokes and

1020
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:31,740
not to me but to other people and it
 

1021
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:34,250
not to me but to other people and it
really offended people and some of the

1022
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:34,260
really offended people and some of the
 

1023
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:37,970
really offended people and some of the
women this is this is the very early 80s

1024
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:37,980
women this is this is the very early 80s
 

1025
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,370
women this is this is the very early 80s
and

1026
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:40,380
and
 

1027
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,830
and
they came said something I talked to my

1028
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:42,840
they came said something I talked to my
 

1029
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,710
they came said something I talked to my
boss I'm a first time manager and he was

1030
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:45,720
boss I'm a first time manager and he was
 

1031
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,230
boss I'm a first time manager and he was
unequivocal with what I should do he

1032
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:48,240
unequivocal with what I should do he
 

1033
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,270
unequivocal with what I should do he
said and this was a top performer it

1034
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:50,280
said and this was a top performer it
 

1035
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,370
said and this was a top performer it
stops immediately or you fire him

1036
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:52,380
stops immediately or you fire him
 

1037
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,049
stops immediately or you fire him
so there are a few areas like that that

1038
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:54,059
so there are a few areas like that that
 

1039
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:56,390
so there are a few areas like that that
I actually think you have to always

that to me isn't the kind that like when

00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,409
deeply deeply I and I think it's an
interesting reason so why do why are you

1108
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:09,419
interesting reason so why do why are you
 

1109
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:11,510
interesting reason so why do why are you
you're preparer my friend yeah yes you

1110
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:11,520
you're preparer my friend yeah yes you
 

1111
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,390
you're preparer my friend yeah yes you
are you prepare for your interviews uh

1112
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:14,400
are you prepare for your interviews uh
 

1113
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,270
are you prepare for your interviews uh
sure the rest you Wing yeah I Wing but

1114
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:17,280
sure the rest you Wing yeah I Wing but
 

1115
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,590
sure the rest you Wing yeah I Wing but
that's okay I mean you don't have to

1116
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:18,600
that's okay I mean you don't have to
 

1117
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,850
that's okay I mean you don't have to
prepare everything I don't prepare

1118
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:19,860
prepare everything I don't prepare
 

1119
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,409
prepare everything I don't prepare
everything either no but I I

1120
00:20:21,409 --> 00:20:21,419
everything either no but I I
 

1121
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:23,510
everything either no but I I
unfortunately Wing stuff I save it to

1122
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:23,520
unfortunately Wing stuff I save it to
 

1123
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,549
unfortunately Wing stuff I save it to
last minute I I push everything I'm

1124
00:20:25,549 --> 00:20:25,559
last minute I I push everything I'm
 

1125
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:28,190
last minute I I push everything I'm
always almost late and I don't know why

1126
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:28,200
always almost late and I don't know why
 

1127
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,390
always almost late and I don't know why
that is I mean there's some deep

1128
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:29,400
that is I mean there's some deep
 

1129
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,770
that is I mean there's some deep
psychological thing we should probably

1130
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:30,780
psychological thing we should probably
 

1131
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,210
psychological thing we should probably
investigate but it's probably the

1132
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:32,220
investigate but it's probably the
 

1133
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,409
investigate but it's probably the
anxiety

1134
00:20:33,409 --> 00:20:33,419
anxiety
 

1135
00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:35,450
anxiety
brings out the performance that can be

1136
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:35,460
brings out the performance that can be
 

1137
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,830
brings out the performance that can be
that's very true with some people I mean

1138
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:36,840
that's very true with some people I mean
 

1139
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,930
that's very true with some people I mean
so I'm a programming engineer at heart

1140
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:38,940
so I'm a programming engineer at heart
 

1141
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,390
so I'm a programming engineer at heart
and so so programmers famously

1142
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:41,400
and so so programmers famously
 

1143
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,390
and so so programmers famously
overestimate or underestimate sorry how

1144
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:44,400
overestimate or underestimate sorry how
 

1145
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,250
overestimate or underestimate sorry how
long that something's going to take and

1146
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:46,260
long that something's going to take and
 

1147
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,930
long that something's going to take and
so I just everything always

1148
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:47,940
so I just everything always
 

1149
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,150
so I just everything always
underestimate and it's almost as if I

1150
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:50,160
underestimate and it's almost as if I
 

1151
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:54,650
underestimate and it's almost as if I
want to feel this chaos of anxiety of a

1152
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:54,660
want to feel this chaos of anxiety of a
 

1153
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:55,789
want to feel this chaos of anxiety of a
deadline or something like this

1154
00:20:55,789 --> 00:20:55,799
deadline or something like this
 

1155
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:57,470
deadline or something like this
otherwise I'll be lazy sitting on a

1156
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:57,480
otherwise I'll be lazy sitting on a
 

1157
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,090
otherwise I'll be lazy sitting on a
beach with a pina colada and relaxing

1158
00:20:59,090 --> 00:20:59,100
beach with a pina colada and relaxing
 

1159
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,950
beach with a pina colada and relaxing
yeah I don't know so that we have to

1160
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:00,960
yeah I don't know so that we have to
 

1161
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,230
yeah I don't know so that we have to
know ourselves but for you for me you

1162
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:03,240
know ourselves but for you for me you
 

1163
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,330
know ourselves but for you for me you
like to prepare yeah it came from a few

1164
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:05,340
like to prepare yeah it came from a few
 

1165
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,830
like to prepare yeah it came from a few
different places I mean one would have

1166
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:06,840
different places I mean one would have
 

1167
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:10,610
different places I mean one would have
been as a as a kid I think

1168
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:10,620
been as a as a kid I think
 

1169
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:11,690
been as a as a kid I think
um

1170
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:11,700
um
 

1171
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,330
um
I was not a memorizer and my brother is

1172
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:14,340
I was not a memorizer and my brother is
 

1173
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,970
I was not a memorizer and my brother is
brilliant he can he read it once boom

1174
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:16,980
brilliant he can he read it once boom
 

1175
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:19,010
brilliant he can he read it once boom
done and so I always wanted to

1176
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:19,020
done and so I always wanted to
 

1177
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,270
done and so I always wanted to
understand like how something happened

1178
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:20,280
understand like how something happened
 

1179
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,070
understand like how something happened
it didn't matter what it was I was doing

1180
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:22,080
it didn't matter what it was I was doing
 

1181
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,289
it didn't matter what it was I was doing
it whether it was algebra theorems I

1182
00:21:24,289 --> 00:21:24,299
it whether it was algebra theorems I
 

1183
00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:25,310
it whether it was algebra theorems I
always wanted don't give me the answer

1184
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:25,320
always wanted don't give me the answer
 

1185
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,570
always wanted don't give me the answer
don't give me the answer you know I want

1186
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:26,580
don't give me the answer you know I want
 

1187
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,710
don't give me the answer you know I want
to figure it out figure out so I could

1188
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:27,720
to figure it out figure out so I could
 

1189
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,270
to figure it out figure out so I could
reproduce it again and didn't have to

1190
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:29,280
reproduce it again and didn't have to
 

1191
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,029
reproduce it again and didn't have to
memorize so it started with that and

1192
00:21:32,029 --> 00:21:32,039
memorize so it started with that and
 

1193
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:33,649
memorize so it started with that and
then over time

1194
00:21:33,649 --> 00:21:33,659
then over time
 

1195
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:36,950
then over time
okay so I was in university in the 70s

1196
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:36,960
okay so I was in university in the 70s
 

1197
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,750
okay so I was in university in the 70s
when I was in engineering school I was

1198
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:38,760
when I was in engineering school I was
 

1199
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,310
when I was in engineering school I was
the only woman you know I meet people

1200
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:40,320
the only woman you know I meet people
 

1201
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,870
the only woman you know I meet people
still to this day and they're like oh I

1202
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:41,880
still to this day and they're like oh I
 

1203
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,190
still to this day and they're like oh I
remember you I'm like yeah sorry I don't

1204
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:43,200
remember you I'm like yeah sorry I don't
 

1205
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,330
remember you I'm like yeah sorry I don't
remember you there were 30 of you wanted

1206
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:44,340
remember you there were 30 of you wanted
 

1207
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:47,930
remember you there were 30 of you wanted
me and I I think you already get that

1208
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:47,940
me and I I think you already get that
 

1209
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,669
me and I I think you already get that
feeling of okay I better really study

1210
00:21:49,669 --> 00:21:49,679
feeling of okay I better really study
 

1211
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:50,810
feeling of okay I better really study
hard because whatever I say is going to

1212
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:50,820
hard because whatever I say is going to
 

1213
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:53,330
hard because whatever I say is going to
be remembered in this class good or bad

1214
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:53,340
be remembered in this class good or bad
 

1215
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:57,529
be remembered in this class good or bad
and it started there so in some ways

1216
00:21:57,529 --> 00:21:57,539
and it started there so in some ways
 

1217
00:21:57,539 --> 00:21:59,930
and it started there so in some ways
I did it for two reasons early on I

1218
00:21:59,930 --> 00:21:59,940
I did it for two reasons early on I
 

1219
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:02,270
I did it for two reasons early on I
think it was a shield for confidence

1220
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:02,280
think it was a shield for confidence
 

1221
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:05,029
think it was a shield for confidence
the more I studied the more prepared I

1222
00:22:05,029 --> 00:22:05,039
the more I studied the more prepared I
 

1223
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,710
the more I studied the more prepared I
was the more confident that's probably

1224
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:06,720
was the more confident that's probably
 

1225
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,390
was the more confident that's probably
still True to this day

1226
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:08,400
still True to this day
 

1227
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,149
still True to this day
the the second reason I did it evolved

1228
00:22:11,149 --> 00:22:11,159
the the second reason I did it evolved
 

1229
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:12,470
the the second reason I did it evolved
over time and became different to

1230
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:12,480
over time and became different to
 

1231
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,029
over time and became different to
prepare

1232
00:22:14,029 --> 00:22:14,039
prepare
 

1233
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:16,250
prepare
um if I was really prepared

1234
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:16,260
um if I was really prepared
 

1235
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,649
um if I was really prepared
then when we're in the moment I can

1236
00:22:18,649 --> 00:22:18,659
then when we're in the moment I can
 

1237
00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:20,750
then when we're in the moment I can
really listen to you see because I don't

1238
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:20,760
really listen to you see because I don't
 

1239
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,950
really listen to you see because I don't
have to be doing all this stuff on the

1240
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:21,960
have to be doing all this stuff on the
 

1241
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,470
have to be doing all this stuff on the
fly in my head and I could actually take

1242
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:24,480
fly in my head and I could actually take
 

1243
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,450
fly in my head and I could actually take
things I know and maybe help the

1244
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:26,460
things I know and maybe help the
 

1245
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:29,750
things I know and maybe help the
situation so it really became a way that

1246
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:29,760
situation so it really became a way that
 

1247
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,630
situation so it really became a way that
I could be present in in the moment and

1248
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:32,640
I could be present in in the moment and
 

1249
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,490
I could be present in in the moment and
I think it's something a lot of people

1250
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:34,500
I think it's something a lot of people
 

1251
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,649
I think it's something a lot of people
that in the moment I I learned it from

1252
00:22:36,649 --> 00:22:36,659
that in the moment I I learned it from
 

1253
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:38,270
that in the moment I I learned it from
my husband he doesn't prepare by the way

1254
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:38,280
my husband he doesn't prepare by the way
 

1255
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:41,149
my husband he doesn't prepare by the way
at all so that's not it but but I

1256
00:22:41,149 --> 00:22:41,159
at all so that's not it but but I
 

1257
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:42,409
at all so that's not it but but I
watched the in the moment the negative

1258
00:22:42,409 --> 00:22:42,419
watched the in the moment the negative
 

1259
00:22:42,419 --> 00:22:44,870
watched the in the moment the negative
example no no no and I'm not going to

1260
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:44,880

something it's a bit stereotype that it
resonates with many many women and I'll

1794
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:22,500
can feel uncomfortable doesn't mean I

1798
00:32:25,549 --> 00:32:25,559
that's why I meant growth and comfort
 

1799
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:29,389
that's why I meant growth and comfort

1811
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,269
looked at me and he said don't ever do
that again and I said I understand

1812
00:32:41,269 --> 00:32:41,279

that again and I said I understand
because it was okay to be uncomfortable

00:32:44,029 --> 00:32:44,039
because it was okay to be uncomfortable

00:32:54,289 --> 00:32:54,299
for times to be uncomfortable because I
 

1823
00:32:54,299 --> 00:32:56,210
for times to be uncomfortable because I
know if I am nervous

1824
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:56,220

00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:04,380
it means you're learning something right
 

1833
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:07,190
it means you're learning something right
holding it together so well that to me

1834
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:07,200
holding it together so well that to me
 

1835
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,830
holding it together so well that to me
matters I think it's interesting the

1836
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:09,840
matters I think it's interesting the
 

1837
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,049

maybe you could speak to the the sort of

1838
00:33:12,049 --> 00:33:12,059
maybe you could speak to the the sort of
 

1839
00:33:12,059 --> 00:33:13,610
maybe you could speak to the the sort of
the self-critical thing inside your

1840
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:13,620
the self-critical thing inside your
 

1841
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:16,430
the self-critical thing inside your
inside your brain because I think

1842
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:16,440
inside your brain because I think
 

1843
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,769
inside your brain because I think
sometimes

1844
00:33:18,769 --> 00:33:18,779
sometimes
 

1845
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:22,970
sometimes
um is talked about that women have that

1846
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:22,980
um is talked about that women have that
 

1847
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:25,370
um is talked about that women have that
um but I have that definitely and I

1848
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:25,380
um but I have that definitely and I
 

1849
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:28,310
um but I have that definitely and I
think that's not just solely property in

1850
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:28,320
think that's not just solely property in
 

1851
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,289
think that's not just solely property in
the workplace but I also want to sort of

1852
00:33:30,289 --> 00:33:30,299
the workplace but I also want to sort of
 

1853
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:32,269
the workplace but I also want to sort of
push back on the idea that that's a bad

1854
00:33:32,269 --> 00:33:32,279
push back on the idea that that's a bad
 

1855
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:35,149
push back on the idea that that's a bad
thing that you should silence because I

1856
00:33:35,149 --> 00:33:35,159
thing that you should silence because I
 

1857
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:37,850
thing that you should silence because I
think that anxiety that leads to growth

1858
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:37,860
think that anxiety that leads to growth
 

1859
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:40,009
think that anxiety that leads to growth
also that's like this discomfort so

1860
00:33:40,009 --> 00:33:40,019
also that's like this discomfort so
 

1861
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:41,630
also that's like this discomfort so
there's this weird balance you have to

1862
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:41,640
there's this weird balance you have to
 

1863
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,430
there's this weird balance you have to
have between that self-critical engine

1864
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:43,440
have between that self-critical engine
 

1865
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,350
have between that self-critical engine
and confidence yeah I think that's a

1866
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:45,360
and confidence yeah I think that's a
 

1867
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,669
and confidence yeah I think that's a
good point you have to kind of dance

1868
00:33:46,669 --> 00:33:46,679
good point you have to kind of dance
 

1869
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:48,230
good point you have to kind of dance
because if you're super confident people

1870
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:48,240
because if you're super confident people
 

1871
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,149
because if you're super confident people
will value you higher that's important

1872
00:33:50,149 --> 00:33:50,159
will value you higher that's important
 

1873
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:52,490
will value you higher that's important
but if you're way too confident maybe in

1874
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:52,500
but if you're way too confident maybe in
 

1875
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,810
but if you're way too confident maybe in

you do it with respect which is the
opposite of fear a lot of people think

2032
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:35,700
opposite of fear a lot of people think
 

2033
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,849
opposite of fear a lot of people think
way to get things done is fear and then

2034
00:36:37,849 --> 00:36:37,859
way to get things done is fear and then
 

2035
00:36:37,859 --> 00:36:40,010
way to get things done is fear and then
the third thing would be you gotta

2036
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:40,020
the third thing would be you gotta
 

2037
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:42,589
the third thing would be you gotta
celebrate some progress versus

2038
00:36:42,589 --> 00:36:42,599
celebrate some progress versus
 

2039
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:44,089
celebrate some progress versus
perfection

2040
00:36:44,089 --> 00:36:44,099
perfection
 

2041
00:36:44,099 --> 00:36:46,190
perfection
because I also think that's what stops a

2042
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:46,200
because I also think that's what stops a
 

2043
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,750
because I also think that's what stops a
lot of things from happening because you

2044
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:47,760
lot of things from happening because you
 

2045
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,190
lot of things from happening because you
know if you go for whatever your

2046
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:49,200
know if you go for whatever your
 

2047
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,470
know if you go for whatever your
definition of perfect is it can it's

2048
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:51,480
definition of perfect is it can it's
 

2049
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:54,230
definition of perfect is it can it's
either polarization or parallelization I

2050
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:54,240
either polarization or parallelization I
 

2051
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,730
either polarization or parallelization I
mean if something happens in there

2052
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:55,740
mean if something happens in there
 

2053
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:58,190
mean if something happens in there
versus no no I can

2054
00:36:58,190 --> 00:36:58,200
versus no no I can
 

2055
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,990
versus no no I can
if don't worry about getting to that

2056
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:00,000
if don't worry about getting to that
 

2057
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,630
if don't worry about getting to that
actual exact end point if I keep taking

2058
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:02,640
actual exact end point if I keep taking
 

2059
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,910
actual exact end point if I keep taking
a step forward of progress really tough

2060
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:04,920
a step forward of progress really tough
 

2061
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:08,150
a step forward of progress really tough
stuff can get done and so my view of

2062
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:08,160
stuff can get done and so my view of
 

2063
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,670
stuff can get done and so my view of
that is like honestly I hope it can you

2064
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:10,680
that is like honestly I hope it can you
 

2065
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,050
that is like honestly I hope it can you
know I said it's like a memoir with

2066
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:12,060
know I said it's like a memoir with
 

2067
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:14,630
know I said it's like a memoir with
purpose I'm only doing it it was a

2068
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:14,640
purpose I'm only doing it it was a
 

2069
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,310
purpose I'm only doing it it was a
really hard thing for me to do because I

2070
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:16,320
really hard thing for me to do because I
 

2071
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,810
really hard thing for me to do because I
don't actually talk about all these

2072
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:17,820
don't actually talk about all these
 

2073
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,970
don't actually talk about all these
things and I had to nobody cares about

2074
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:19,980
things and I had to nobody cares about
 

2075
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,890
things and I had to nobody cares about
your like scientific description of this

2076
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:21,900
your like scientific description of this
 

2077
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,870
your like scientific description of this
they want the stories in your life to

2078
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:23,880
they want the stories in your life to
 

2079
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,089
they want the stories in your life to
bring it alive so it's a memoir with

2080
00:37:26,089 --> 00:37:26,099
bring it alive so it's a memoir with
 

2081
00:37:26,099 --> 00:37:27,829
bring it alive so it's a memoir with
purpose and in the writing of it it

2082
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:27,839
purpose and in the writing of it it
 

2083
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:30,470
purpose and in the writing of it it
became the power of me the power of we

2084
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:30,480
became the power of me the power of we
 

2085
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,050
became the power of me the power of we
and the power of us the idea that you

2086
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:33,060
and the power of us the idea that you
 

2087
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:34,970
and the power of us the idea that you
build a foundation when you're young

2088
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:34,980
build a foundation when you're young
 

2089
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:37,790
build a foundation when you're young
mostly from my work life the power of we

2090
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:37,800
mostly from my work life the power of we
 

2091
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,410
mostly from my work life the power of we
which says

2092
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:39,420
which says
 

2093
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:42,890
which says
I kind of in retrospect could see five

2094
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:42,900
I kind of in retrospect could see five
 

2095
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:46,130
I kind of in retrospect could see five
principles on how to really Drive change

2096
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:46,140
principles on how to really Drive change
 

2097
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:48,530
principles on how to really Drive change
um that would be done in a good way and

2098
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:48,540
um that would be done in a good way and
 

2099
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,150
um that would be done in a good way and
then eventually you could scale that the

2100
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:50,160
then eventually you could scale that the
 

2101
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,030
then eventually you could scale that the
power really of us which is what I'm

2102
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:53,040
power really of us which is what I'm
 

2103
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,130
power really of us which is what I'm
doing about finding better jobs for more

2104
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:55,140
doing about finding better jobs for more
 

2105
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,990
doing about finding better jobs for more
people now that I code this co-chair an

2106
00:37:56,990 --> 00:37:57,000
people now that I code this co-chair an
 

2107
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,290
people now that I code this co-chair an
organization called 110. so that essence

00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:04,560
navigate tensions do it respectfully
 

2113
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,710
navigate tensions do it respectfully
celebrate progress

2114
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:06,720
celebrate progress
 

2115
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,450
celebrate progress
and

2116
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:08,460
and
 

2117
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:11,150
and
give me indulge me one more minute these

2118
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:11,160
give me indulge me one more minute these
 

2119
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,670
give me indulge me one more minute these
sort of again it's retrospect that I I

2120
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:13,680
sort of again it's retrospect that I I
 

2121
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,349
sort of again it's retrospect that I I
didn't know this in the moment I had to

2122
00:38:15,349 --> 00:38:15,359
didn't know this in the moment I had to
 

2123
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:17,150
didn't know this in the moment I had to
learn it I learned it I am blessed by a

2124
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:17,160
learn it I learned it I am blessed by a
 

2125
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,829
learn it I learned it I am blessed by a
lot of people I worked with and around

2126
00:38:18,829 --> 00:38:18,839
lot of people I worked with and around
 

2127
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:21,530
lot of people I worked with and around
and

2128
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:21,540

 

2129
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:23,630

but some of the the principles like the

2130
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:23,640
but some of the the principles like the
 

2131
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:26,030
but some of the the principles like the
first one is says

2132
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:26,040
first one is says
 

2133
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,650
first one is says
if you're going to do something change

2134
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:27,660
if you're going to do something change
 

2135
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:30,530
if you're going to do something change
something do something you got to be in

2136
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:30,540
something do something you got to be in
 

2137
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,930
something do something you got to be in
service of something

2138
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:32,940
service of something
 

2139
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:34,970
service of something
being in service of is really different

2140
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:34,980
being in service of is really different
 

2141
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,410
being in service of is really different
than serving

2142
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:36,420
than serving
 

2143
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,670
than serving
super different

2144
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:37,680
super different
 

2145
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:41,329
super different
and like I just had my knee replaced

2146
00:38:41,329 --> 00:38:41,339
and like I just had my knee replaced
 

2147
00:38:41,339 --> 00:38:43,609
and like I just had my knee replaced
and I interviewed all these doctors you

2148
00:38:43,609 --> 00:38:43,619
and I interviewed all these doctors you
 

2149
00:38:43,619 --> 00:38:44,569
and I interviewed all these doctors you
can tell the difference of the guy who's

2150
00:38:44,569 --> 00:38:44,579
can tell the difference of the guy who's
 

2151
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:45,890
can tell the difference of the guy who's
going to do a surgery hey my surgery is

2152
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:45,900
going to do a surgery hey my surgery is
 

2153
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,089
going to do a surgery hey my surgery is
fine I really don't care whether you can

2154
00:38:47,089 --> 00:38:47,099
fine I really don't care whether you can
 

2155
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:48,170
fine I really don't care whether you can
walk and do the stuff you want to do

2156
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:48,180
walk and do the stuff you want to do
 

2157
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:49,370
walk and do the stuff you want to do
again but because my surgery is fine

2158
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:49,380
again but because my surgery is fine
 

2159
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:51,470
again but because my surgery is fine
your Hardware is good

2160
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:51,480
your Hardware is good
 

2161
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,510
your Hardware is good
I actually had some trouble

2162
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:53,520
I actually had some trouble
 

2163
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,190
I actually had some trouble
and I had a Doctor Who's like you know

2164
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:55,200
and I had a Doctor Who's like you know
 

2165
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,630
and I had a Doctor Who's like you know
this doesn't sound right I'm coming to

2166
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:56,640
this doesn't sound right I'm coming to
 

2167
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,990
this doesn't sound right I'm coming to
you like the surgery was fine it was me

2168
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:00,000
you like the surgery was fine it was me
 

2169
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,210
you like the surgery was fine it was me
that was reacting wrong to it and he

2170
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:02,220
that was reacting wrong to it and he
 

2171
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,710
that was reacting wrong to it and he
didn't care until I could walk again

2172
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:03,720
didn't care until I could walk again
 

2173
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,450
didn't care until I could walk again
okay there's a big difference in those

2174
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:05,460
okay there's a big difference in those
 

2175
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:07,670
okay there's a big difference in those
two things and it's true in any business

2176
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:07,680
two things and it's true in any business
 

2177
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,349
two things and it's true in any business
you have

2178
00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:09,359
you have
 

2179
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:12,170
you have
um a waiter serves you food okay serves

2180
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:12,180
um a waiter serves you food okay serves
 

2181
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:13,609
um a waiter serves you food okay serves
his food he did his job or did he carry

2182
00:39:13,609 --> 00:39:13,619
his food he did his job or did he carry
 

2183
00:39:13,619 --> 00:39:16,430
his food he did his job or did he carry
he had a good time so that thought to be

2184
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:16,440
he had a good time so that thought to be
 

2185
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,870
he had a good time so that thought to be
in service of it took me a while to get

2186
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:17,880
in service of it took me a while to get
 

2187

2344
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:01,740
my sort of rocky road through there
 

2345
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:04,370
my sort of rocky road through there
but it started with the power of we and

2346
00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:04,380
but it started with the power of we and
 

2347
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:06,589
but it started with the power of we and
there's that big leap I think that

2348
00:42:06,589 --> 00:42:06,599
there's that big leap I think that
 

2349
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:07,970
there's that big leap I think that
propagates to the things you're saying

2350
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:07,980
propagates to the things you're saying
 

2351
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:09,890
propagates to the things you're saying
which is the leap from focusing on

2352
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:09,900
which is the leap from focusing on
 

2353
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,630
which is the leap from focusing on
yourself to the focusing on others so

2354
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:11,640
yourself to the focusing on others so
 

2355
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:14,870
yourself to the focusing on others so
that having that empathy you've said at

2356
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:14,880
that having that empathy you've said at
 

2357
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,430
that having that empathy you've said at
some point in our lives and careers our

2358
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:16,440
some point in our lives and careers our
 

2359
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,470
some point in our lives and careers our
attention turns from ourselves to others

2360
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:18,480
attention turns from ourselves to others
 

2361
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,450
attention turns from ourselves to others
we still have our own goals but we

2362
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:20,460
we still have our own goals but we
 

2363
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:22,849
we still have our own goals but we
recognize that our actions affect many

2364
00:42:22,849 --> 00:42:22,859
recognize that our actions affect many
 

2365
00:42:22,859 --> 00:42:25,370
recognize that our actions affect many
and it is impossible to achieve anything

2366
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:25,380
and it is impossible to achieve anything
 

2367
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:29,150
and it is impossible to achieve anything
truly meaningful alone so it's do you I

2368
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:29,160
truly meaningful alone so it's do you I
 

2369
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,329
truly meaningful alone so it's do you I
think maybe you can correct me but

2370
00:42:31,329 --> 00:42:31,339
think maybe you can correct me but
 

2371
00:42:31,339 --> 00:42:33,550
think maybe you can correct me but
ultimate good power is about

2372
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:33,560
ultimate good power is about
 

2373
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:38,810
ultimate good power is about
collaboration and maybe in you know in a

2374
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:38,820
collaboration and maybe in you know in a
 

2375
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:41,210
collaboration and maybe in you know in a
large companies like delegation on on

2376
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:41,220
large companies like delegation on on
 

2377
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:43,550
large companies like delegation on on
great teams the ultimate good power is

2378
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:43,560
great teams the ultimate good power is
 

2379
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:44,990
great teams the ultimate good power is
actually doing something for society

2380
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:45,000
actually doing something for society
 

2381
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,370
actually doing something for society
that would be my ultimate definition

2382
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:46,380
that would be my ultimate definition
 

2383
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:48,349
that would be my ultimate definition
because about the results of the things

2384
00:42:48,349 --> 00:42:48,359
because about the results of the things
 

2385
00:42:48,359 --> 00:42:51,650
because about the results of the things
yeah but how it's done right the how

2386
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:51,660
yeah but how it's done right the how
 

2387
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:53,750
yeah but how it's done right the how
it's done and so

2388
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:53,760
it's done and so
 

2389
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:54,589
it's done and so
um

2390
00:42:54,589 --> 00:42:54,599
um
 

2391
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:57,349
um
you know when you set a leap do you

2392
00:42:57,349 --> 00:42:57,359
you know when you set a leap do you
 

2393
00:42:57,359 --> 00:42:58,609
you know when you set a leap do you
think you people make a leap when they

2394
00:42:58,609 --> 00:42:58,619
think you people make a leap when they
 

2395
00:42:58,619 --> 00:42:59,990
think you people make a leap when they
go from thinking about themselves to

2396
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:00,000
go from thinking about themselves to
 

2397
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,730
go from thinking about themselves to
others do you think it's a leap or do

2398
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:01,740
others do you think it's a leap or do
 

2399
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:03,230
others do you think it's a leap or do
you think it kind of just is a sort of

2400
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:03,240
you think it kind of just is a sort of
 

2401
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:06,069
you think it kind of just is a sort of
slow point I think the leap is in

2402
00:43:06,069 --> 00:43:06,079
slow point I think the leap is in
 

2403
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:09,170
slow point I think the leap is in
deciding that this is uh oh it's like

2404
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:09,180
deciding that this is uh oh it's like
 

2405
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:11,870
deciding that this is uh oh it's like
deciding that you will

2406
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:11,880
deciding that you will
 

2407
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:14,270
deciding that you will
care about others that this is it's like

2408
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:14,280
care about others that this is it's like
 

2409
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,950
care about others that this is it's like
it's like a leap of going to the gym for

2410
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:15,960
it's like a leap of going to the gym for
 

2411
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,870
it's like a leap of going to the gym for
the first time it's yes it takes a long

2412
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:17,880
the first time it's yes it takes a long
 

2413
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,250
the first time it's yes it takes a long
time to develop that and to actually

2414
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:19,260
time to develop that and to actually
 

2415
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:21,470
time to develop that and to actually
care but the decision that I'm going to

2416
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:21,480
care but the decision that I'm going to
 

2417
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,970
care but the decision that I'm going to
actually care about other human beings

2418
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:22,980
actually care about other human beings
 

2419
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:25,970
actually care about other human beings
yeah yeah okay or at least like yeah it

2420
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:25,980
yeah yeah okay or at least like yeah it
 

2421
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:28,490
yeah yeah okay or at least like yeah it
just feels like a deliberate action you

2422
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:28,500
just feels like a deliberate action you
 

2423
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:30,170
just feels like a deliberate action you
take of empathy Yeah because sometimes I

2424
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:30,180
take of empathy Yeah because sometimes I
 

2425
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:32,030
take of empathy Yeah because sometimes I
think it happens a little it's maybe not

2426
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:32,040
think it happens a little it's maybe not
 

2427
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,530
think it happens a little it's maybe not
as deliberate yeah it is a little bit

2428
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:33,540
as deliberate yeah it is a little bit
 

2429
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:35,270
as deliberate yeah it is a little bit
more gradual because it might happen

2430
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:35,280
more gradual because it might happen
 

2431
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,770
more gradual because it might happen
because you realize that geez I can't

2432
00:43:36,770 --> 00:43:36,780
because you realize that geez I can't
 

2433
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,329
because you realize that geez I can't
get this done alone so I gotta have

2434
00:43:38,329 --> 00:43:38,339
get this done alone so I gotta have
 

2435
00:43:38,339 --> 00:43:40,309
get this done alone so I gotta have
other people with me but how do I get

2436
00:43:40,309 --> 00:43:40,319
other people with me but how do I get
 

2437
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:42,050
other people with me but how do I get
them to help me do something so I think

2438
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:42,060
them to help me do something so I think
 

2439
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:44,150
them to help me do something so I think
it does help and happen a little bit

2440
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:44,160
it does help and happen a little bit
 

2441
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,250
it does help and happen a little bit
more gradually and as you get more

2442
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:46,260
more gradually and as you get more
 

2443
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:48,410
more gradually and as you get more
confident you start to not think so much

2444
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:48,420
confident you start to not think so much
 

2445
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:50,450
confident you start to not think so much
that it's about you and you start to

2446
00:43:50,450 --> 00:43:50,460
that it's about you and you start to
 

2447
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:51,770
that it's about you and you start to
think about this other thing you're

2448
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:51,780
think about this other thing you're
 

2449
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:54,050
think about this other thing you're
trying to accomplish and so that's why I

2450
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:54,060
trying to accomplish and so that's why I
 

2451
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:56,990
trying to accomplish and so that's why I
felt it was a little more uh gradual I

2452
00:43:56,990 --> 00:43:57,000
felt it was a little more uh gradual I
 

2453
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,170
felt it was a little more uh gradual I
also felt like I can remember so well

2454
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:00,180
also felt like I can remember so well
 

2455
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:02,809
also felt like I can remember so well
you know

2456
00:44:02,809 --> 00:44:02,819
you know
 

2457
00:44:02,819 --> 00:44:05,329
you know
this idea that um again now we're in the

2458
00:44:05,329 --> 00:44:05,339
this idea that um again now we're in the
 

2459

maybe I didn't want to be but that

2500
00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:46,920
maybe I didn't want to be but that
 

2501
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,230
maybe I didn't want to be but that
didn't really matter

2502
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:48,240
didn't really matter
 

2503
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,089
didn't really matter
so I could either accept that and

embrace it or not I think it's a good
 

2507
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:53,630
embrace it or not I think it's a good

00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:55,790
example of that transition I did have a
little Epiphany with that happening and

2510
00:44:55,790 --> 00:44:55,800
little Epiphany with that happening and
 

2511

00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:38,400
me for quite a while and she was one of
 

2611
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,589
me for quite a while and she was one of
the few people that would tell me the

2623
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,670
and I think it also comes it'll go back
to my complete commit commitment to

2624
00:46:52,670 --> 00:46:52,680
to my complete commit commitment to
 

2625
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,530
to my complete commit commitment to
inclusion and diversity because you've

00:46:54,530 --> 00:46:54,540
inclusion and diversity because you've
 

2627
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:56,150
inclusion and diversity because you've
got to have that variety around you

2631
00:46:57,540 --> 00:47:00,349
you'll get a better product and a better
answer at the end of the day and so that

2632
00:47:00,349 --> 00:47:00,359
answer at the end of the day and so that
 

2633
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:02,630
answer at the end of the day and so that
to resist that Allure I think it's

2634
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:02,640
to resist that Allure I think it's
 

2635
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,130
to resist that Allure I think it's
around about who you surround yourself

2636

every company faces that today and that
 

2775
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:28,490
every company faces that today and that
um I always felt like there's so much

2776
00:49:28,490 --> 00:49:28,500
um I always felt like there's so much
 

2777
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,050
um I always felt like there's so much
discussion about stakeholder capitalism

2778
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:30,060
discussion about stakeholder capitalism

you have multiple
I have always found and I've been very

2784
00:49:35,690 --> 00:49:35,700
I have always found and I've been very
 

2785
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:38,270
I have always found and I've been very
vocal about that topic that um when I

2786
00:49:38,270 --> 00:49:38,280
vocal about that topic that um when I
 

2787

had multiple stakeholders
I think it's common sense like if you're

2794
00:49:44,870 --> 00:49:44,880
I think it's common sense like if you're
 

2795
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,730
I think it's common sense like if you're
going to be 100 years old you only get

2796
00:49:46,730 --> 00:49:46,740
going to be 100 years old you only get
 

2797
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:48,589
going to be 100 years old you only get
there because you actually do at some

2798
00:49:48,589 --> 00:49:48,599
there because you actually do at some
 

2799
00:49:48,599 --> 00:49:50,150
there because you actually do at some
time balance all these different

2800
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:50,160
time balance all these different
 

2801
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,010
time balance all these different
stakeholders in what it is that you do

2802
00:49:52,010 --> 00:49:52,020
stakeholders in what it is that you do
 

2803
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:54,050
stakeholders in what it is that you do
and short term long term all these

2804
00:49:54,050 --> 00:49:54,060
and short term long term all these
 

2805
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:56,030
and short term long term all these
trade-offs and I always say people who

2806
00:49:56,030 --> 00:49:56,040
trade-offs and I always say people who
 

2807
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:57,829
trade-offs and I always say people who
write about it they write about it black

2808
00:49:57,829 --> 00:49:57,839
write about it they write about it black
 

2809
00:49:57,839 --> 00:49:59,450
write about it they write about it black
and white but I have to live in a gray

2810
00:49:59,450 --> 00:49:59,460
and white but I have to live in a gray
 

2811
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:01,609
and white but I have to live in a gray
World it nothing I've ever done has been

2812
00:50:01,609 --> 00:50:01,619
World it nothing I've ever done has been
 

2813
00:50:01,619 --> 00:50:03,290
World it nothing I've ever done has been
in a black and white World hardly maybe

2814
00:50:03,290 --> 00:50:03,300
in a black and white World hardly maybe
 

2815
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:04,970
in a black and white World hardly maybe
things of values that I had to answer

2816
00:50:04,970 --> 00:50:04,980
things of values that I had to answer
 

2817
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:08,329
things of values that I had to answer
but most of it is great and so

2818
00:50:08,329 --> 00:50:08,339
but most of it is great and so
 

2819
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:10,069
but most of it is great and so
um I think back lots of different

2820
00:50:10,069 --> 00:50:10,079
um I think back lots of different
 

2821
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:11,270
um I think back lots of different
decisions

2822
00:50:11,270 --> 00:50:11,280
decisions
 

2823
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:14,150
decisions
um I think back as you would well

2824
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:14,160
um I think back as you would well
 

2825
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,250
um I think back as you would well
remember you're a student of History IBM

2826
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:16,260
remember you're a student of History IBM
 

2827
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:18,170
remember you're a student of History IBM
was one of the really The Originators of

2828
00:50:18,170 --> 00:50:18,180
was one of the really The Originators of
 

2829
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:20,089
was one of the really The Originators of
the semiconductor industry and certainly

2830
00:50:20,089 --> 00:50:20,099
the semiconductor industry and certainly
 

2831
00:50:20,099 --> 00:50:21,589
the semiconductor industry and certainly
of commercializing the semiconductor

2832
00:50:21,589 --> 00:50:21,599
of commercializing the semiconductor
 

2833
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:25,309
of commercializing the semiconductor
industry great r d and Manufacturing but

2834
00:50:25,309 --> 00:50:25,319
industry great r d and Manufacturing but
 

2835
00:50:25,319 --> 00:50:28,490
industry great r d and Manufacturing but
it is a game of volume and so when I

2836
00:50:28,490 --> 00:50:28,500
it is a game of volume and so when I
 

2837
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:31,609
it is a game of volume and so when I
came on we were still manufacturing r d

2838
00:50:31,609 --> 00:50:31,619
came on we were still manufacturing r d
 

2839
00:50:31,619 --> 00:50:34,130
came on we were still manufacturing r d
and Manufacturing our own chips we were

2840
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:34,140
and Manufacturing our own chips we were
 

2841
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:36,410
and Manufacturing our own chips we were
losing a lot of money yet here we had to

2842
00:50:36,410 --> 00:50:36,420
losing a lot of money yet here we had to
 

2843
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:40,010
losing a lot of money yet here we had to
fight a war on cloud and Ai and so okay

2844
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:40,020
fight a war on cloud and Ai and so okay
 

2845
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:42,230
fight a war on cloud and Ai and so okay
now shareholders would say fine shut it

2846
00:50:42,230 --> 00:50:42,240
now shareholders would say fine shut it
 

2847
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,750
now shareholders would say fine shut it
down okay those chips also power some of

2848
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:44,760
down okay those chips also power some of
 

2849
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:46,069
down okay those chips also power some of
the most important systems that power

2850
00:50:46,069 --> 00:50:46,079
the most important systems that power
 

2851
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:49,430
the most important systems that power
these the banks of today if I just shut

2852
00:50:49,430 --> 00:50:49,440
these the banks of today if I just shut
 

2853
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:52,609
these the banks of today if I just shut
it down what would that do and so okay

2854
00:50:52,609 --> 00:50:52,619
it down what would that do and so okay
 

2855
00:50:52,619 --> 00:50:55,430
it down what would that do and so okay
the answer wasn't just stop it the

2856
00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:55,440
the answer wasn't just stop it the
 

2857
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:56,870
the answer wasn't just stop it the
answer wasn't just keep putting money

2858
00:50:56,870 --> 00:50:56,880
answer wasn't just keep putting money
 

2859
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:59,210
answer wasn't just keep putting money
into it the answer was and we had to

2860
00:50:59,210 --> 00:50:59,220
into it the answer was and we had to
 

2861
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:00,530
into it the answer was and we had to
kind of sit in an uncomfortable spot

2862
00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:00,540
kind of sit in an uncomfortable spot
 

2863
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:02,809
kind of sit in an uncomfortable spot
till we found a way I mean it's going to

2864
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:02,819
till we found a way I mean it's going to
 

2865
00:51:02,819 --> 00:51:05,690
till we found a way I mean it's going to
sound so basic but you as an engineer

2866
00:51:05,690 --> 00:51:05,700
sound so basic but you as an engineer
 

2867
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:08,690
sound so basic but you as an engineer
understand it we had to separate it was

2868
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:08,700
understand it we had to separate it was
 

2869
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:10,370
understand it we had to separate it was
a very integrated process of research

2870
00:51:10,370 --> 00:51:10,380
a very integrated process of research
 

2871
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:11,809
a very integrated process of research
development and Manufacturing and you'd

2872
00:51:11,809 --> 00:51:11,819
development and Manufacturing and you'd
 

2873
00:51:11,819 --> 00:51:13,730
development and Manufacturing and you'd
also you'd be perfecting things in

2874
00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:13,740
also you'd be perfecting things in
 

2875
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:15,950
also you'd be perfecting things in
manufacturing and bits these were very

2876
00:51:15,950 --> 00:51:15,960
manufacturing and bits these were very
 

2877
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:17,630
manufacturing and bits these were very
high performance chips

2878
00:51:17,630 --> 00:51:17,640
high performance chips
 

2879
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,549
high performance chips
we had to be able to separate those we

2880
00:51:19,549 --> 00:51:19,559
we had to be able to separate those we
 

2881
00:51:19,559 --> 00:51:21,170
we had to be able to separate those we
eventually found a way to do that so

2882
00:51:21,170 --> 00:51:21,180
eventually found a way to do that so
 

2883
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:22,549
eventually found a way to do that so
that we could

2884
00:51:22,549 --> 00:51:22,559
that we could
 

2885
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:24,829
that we could
um take the manufacturing elsewhere and

2886
00:51:24,829 --> 00:51:24,839
um take the manufacturing elsewhere and
 

2887
00:51:24,839 --> 00:51:27,770
um take the manufacturing elsewhere and
we would maintain the r d it's a I think

2888
00:51:27,770 --> 00:51:27,780
we would maintain the r d it's a I think
 

2889
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:28,790
we would maintain the r d it's a I think
it's a great example of the question you

2890
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:28,800
it's a great example of the question you
 

2891
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,349
it's a great example of the question you
just asked because

2892
00:51:30,349 --> 00:51:30,359
just asked because
 

2893
00:51:30,359 --> 00:51:32,270
just asked because
there was people would have applaud it

2894
00:51:32,270 --> 00:51:32,280
there was people would have applaud it
 

2895
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,549
there was people would have applaud it
others would have been this was horrible

2896
00:51:34,549 --> 00:51:34,559
others would have been this was horrible
 

2897
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:37,790
others would have been this was horrible
or we had a financial roadmap that had

2898
00:51:37,790 --> 00:51:37,800
or we had a financial roadmap that had
 

2899
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,049
or we had a financial roadmap that had
been put in place that said I'll make

2900
00:51:39,049 --> 00:51:39,059
been put in place that said I'll make
 

2901
00:51:39,059 --> 00:51:41,690
been put in place that said I'll make
this amount EPS by this date there came

2902
00:51:41,690 --> 00:51:41,700
this amount EPS by this date there came
 

2903
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:43,970
this amount EPS by this date there came
a time we couldn't honor it because we

2904
00:51:43,970 --> 00:51:43,980
a time we couldn't honor it because we
 

2905
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:46,970
a time we couldn't honor it because we
had to invest and so there's a million

2906
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:46,980
had to invest and so there's a million
 

2907
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:48,829
had to invest and so there's a million
of these decisions I think most people

2908
00:51:48,829 --> 00:51:48,839
of these decisions I think most people
 

2909
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:51,710
of these decisions I think most people
if they're run firms any size firm

2910
00:51:51,710 --> 00:51:51,720
if they're run firms any size firm
 

2911
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:53,270
if they're run firms any size firm
they're just one right after another

2912
00:51:53,270 --> 00:51:53,280
they're just one right after another
 

2913
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:55,250
they're just one right after another
like that and you're always making that

2914
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:55,260
like that and you're always making that
 

2915
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:57,890
like that and you're always making that
short and long tension of what am I

2916
00:51:57,890 --> 00:51:57,900
short and long tension of what am I
 

2917
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:00,230
short and long tension of what am I
giving up what is that partnership like

2918
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:00,240
giving up what is that partnership like
 

2919
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,549
giving up what is that partnership like
with the with the class because you work

2920
00:52:01,549 --> 00:52:01,559
with the with the class because you work
 

2921
00:52:01,559 --> 00:52:04,309
with the with the class because you work
with gigantic businesses and what what's

2922
00:52:04,309 --> 00:52:04,319
with gigantic businesses and what what's
 

2923
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:06,650
with gigantic businesses and what what's
it like

2924
00:52:06,650 --> 00:52:06,660
it like
 

2925
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:08,750
it like
sort of um

00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:10,790
sort of um
really forming a great relationship with

2928
00:52:10,790 --> 00:52:10,800
really forming a great relationship with
 

2929
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,109
really forming a great relationship with
them understanding what their needs are

2930
00:52:12,109 --> 00:52:12,119
them understanding what their needs are
 

2931
00:52:12,119 --> 00:52:14,870
them understanding what their needs are
being service of their in terms of yeah

2932
00:52:14,870 --> 00:52:14,880
being service of their in terms of yeah
 

2933
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,549
being service of their in terms of yeah
very simple

2934
00:52:16,549 --> 00:52:16,559
very simple
 

2935
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:18,890
very simple
honor your promises

2936
00:52:18,890 --> 00:52:18,900
honor your promises
 

2937
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:22,130
honor your promises
and that happens over time I mean in

2938
00:52:22,130 --> 00:52:22,140
and that happens over time I mean in
 

2939
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:24,170
and that happens over time I mean in
service of you know which is often why

2940
00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:24,180
service of you know which is often why
 

2941
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:25,490
service of you know which is often why
you could work with competitors because

2942
00:52:25,490 --> 00:52:25,500
you could work with competitors because
 

2943
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:27,589
you could work with competitors because
if you are really in service of you and

2944
00:52:27,589 --> 00:52:27,599
if you are really in service of you and
 

2945
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:29,089
if you are really in service of you and
you need something it takes two of us to

2946
00:52:29,089 --> 00:52:29,099
you need something it takes two of us to
 

2947
00:52:29,099 --> 00:52:31,609
you need something it takes two of us to
do it that becomes easier to do because

2948
00:52:31,609 --> 00:52:31,619
do it that becomes easier to do because
 

2949
00:52:31,619 --> 00:52:33,829
do it that becomes easier to do because
I really we both care you get what you

2950
00:52:33,829 --> 00:52:33,839
I really we both care you get what you
 

2951
00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:37,010
I really we both care you get what you
needed and so I can remember

2952
00:52:37,010 --> 00:52:37,020
needed and so I can remember
 

2953
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:37,790
needed and so I can remember
um

2954
00:52:37,790 --> 00:52:37,800
um
 

2955
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,230
um
during one of the times I was on a

2956
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:39,240
during one of the times I was on a
 

2957
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:41,210
during one of the times I was on a
European trip and

2958
00:52:41,210 --> 00:52:41,220
European trip and
 

2959
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:43,730
European trip and
at the time a lot and this is still true

2960
00:52:43,730 --> 00:52:43,740
at the time a lot and this is still true
 

2961
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:46,910
at the time a lot and this is still true
about views about technology and

2962
00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:46,920
about views about technology and
 

2963
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:49,190
about views about technology and
National technology Giants and Global

2964
00:52:49,190 --> 00:52:49,200

um
 

3131
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:53,930
um
if you would I also divested 10 billion

3132
00:55:53,930 --> 00:55:53,940
if you would I also divested 10 billion
 

3133
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:55,730
if you would I also divested 10 billion
dollars of businesses so if you would

3134
00:55:55,730 --> 00:55:55,740
dollars of businesses so if you would
 

3135
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:56,930
dollars of businesses so if you would
look at that growth rate without

3136
00:55:56,930 --> 00:55:56,940
look at that growth rate without
 

3137
00:55:56,940 --> 00:55:58,910
look at that growth rate without
divestitures and currency which now

3138
00:55:58,910 --> 00:55:58,920
divestitures and currency which now
 

3139

for IBM to live at second century and so
 

3183
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:47,329

and my successor they have picked up
 

3185
00:56:47,339 --> 00:56:50,150
and my successor they have picked up
gone for it I mean you go back we did

3186
00:56:50,150 --> 00:56:50,160
gone for it I mean you go back we did
 

3187
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:51,710
gone for it I mean you go back we did
the acquisition of red hat I mean we had

3188
00:56:51,710 --> 00:56:51,720
the acquisition of red hat I mean we had
 

3189
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:53,510
the acquisition of red hat I mean we had
to find our way on cloud right we were

3190
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:53,520
to find our way on cloud right we were
 

3191
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:56,510
to find our way on cloud right we were
late to it so we had to find our way and

3192
00:56:56,510 --> 00:56:56,520
late to it so we had to find our way and
 

3193
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:58,910
late to it so we had to find our way and
eventually that led us to hybrid cloud

3194
00:56:58,910 --> 00:56:58,920
eventually that led us to hybrid cloud
 

3195
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:00,950
eventually that led us to hybrid cloud
we did a lot of work with red hat back

3196
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:00,960
we did a lot of work with red hat back
 

3197
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:03,410
we did a lot of work with red hat back
in 2017 oh we'd always done a lot of

3198
00:57:03,410 --> 00:57:03,420
in 2017 oh we'd always done a lot of

in 2017 oh we'd always done a lot of
work with them actually we're one of the

3200
00:57:04,370 --> 00:57:04,380
work with them actually we're one of the

First Investors when they were first
 

3203
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:06,710
First Investors when they were first
formed

3204
00:57:06,710 --> 00:57:06,720
formed
 

3205
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:10,190
formed
um but that was 2018 you know it took

3206
00:57:10,190 --> 00:57:10,200
um but that was 2018 you know it took
 

3207
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:11,870
um but that was 2018 you know it took
quite a hit for even you know oh it was

3208
00:57:11,870 --> 00:57:11,880
quite a hit for even you know oh it was
 

3209
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:13,849
quite a hit for even you know oh it was
the largest to then software acquisition

3210
00:57:13,849 --> 00:57:13,859
the largest to then software acquisition
 

3211
00:57:13,859 --> 00:57:17,870
the largest to then software acquisition
ever but it is the foundation right of

3212
00:57:17,870 --> 00:57:17,880
ever but it is the foundation right of
 

3213
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:19,790
ever but it is the foundation right of
what is our hybrid Cloud play today and

3214
00:57:19,790 --> 00:57:19,800
what is our hybrid Cloud play today and
 

3215
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:22,849
what is our hybrid Cloud play today and
doing very very well so but I had to

3216
00:57:22,849 --> 00:57:22,859
doing very very well so but I had to
 

3217
00:57:22,859 --> 00:57:24,109
doing very very well so but I had to
take a short-term hit for that right

3218
00:57:24,109 --> 00:57:24,119
take a short-term hit for that right
 

3219
00:57:24,119 --> 00:57:26,089
take a short-term hit for that right
short-term hit for a very large 34

3220
00:57:26,089 --> 00:57:26,099
short-term hit for a very large 34
 

3221
00:57:26,099 --> 00:57:28,549
short-term hit for a very large 34
billion dollar acquisition uh but it was

3222
00:57:28,549 --> 00:57:28,559
billion dollar acquisition uh but it was
 

3223
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:30,170
billion dollar acquisition uh but it was
for all of us it was the right thing to

3224
00:57:30,170 --> 00:57:30,180
for all of us it was the right thing to
 

3225
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:32,210
for all of us it was the right thing to
do so I think when you get really

3226
00:57:32,210 --> 00:57:32,220
do so I think when you get really
 

3227
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:33,530
do so I think when you get really
centered on you know it's the right

3228
00:57:33,530 --> 00:57:33,540
centered on you know it's the right
 

3229
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:36,109
centered on you know it's the right
thing to do you just keep going right so

3230
00:57:36,109 --> 00:57:36,119
thing to do you just keep going right so
 

3231
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:37,609
thing to do you just keep going right so
the team had the vision they had the

3232
00:57:37,609 --> 00:57:37,619
the team had the vision they had the
 

3233
00:57:37,619 --> 00:57:40,370

belief and everything else so don't we

3234
00:57:40,370 --> 00:57:40,380
belief and everything else so don't we
 

3235
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:41,750
belief and everything else so don't we
didn't always have exactly the right you

3236
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:41,760
didn't always have exactly the right you
 

3237
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:44,450
didn't always have exactly the right you
know this wasn't a Straight Arrow but

3238
00:57:44,450 --> 00:57:44,460
know this wasn't a Straight Arrow but
 

3239
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:46,490
know this wasn't a Straight Arrow but
stay down you know you're right keep

3240
00:57:46,490 --> 00:57:46,500
stay down you know you're right keep
 

3241
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:48,170
stay down you know you're right keep
going okay made a mistake you know

00:57:49,309 --> 00:57:49,319
there's no bad mistake as long as you
 

3245
00:57:49,319 --> 00:57:51,290
there's no bad mistake as long as you
learn from it right and and keep moving

3246
00:57:51,290 --> 00:57:51,300
learn from it right and and keep moving
 

3247
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:53,450
learn from it right and and keep moving
so yes did it take longer but we are the

3248
00:57:53,450 --> 00:57:53,460
so yes did it take longer but we are the
 

3249
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:55,190
so yes did it take longer but we are the
largest that was there could you maybe

3250
00:57:55,190 --> 00:57:55,200
largest that was there could you maybe
 

3251
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:57,410
largest that was there could you maybe
just on a small tangent educate me a

3252
00:57:57,410 --> 00:57:57,420
just on a small tangent educate me a
 

3253
00:57:57,420 --> 00:57:59,510
just on a small tangent educate me a
little bit so red hat originally is

a little bit of Consulting but it's
 

3261
00:58:05,579 --> 00:58:08,150
a little bit of Consulting but it's
mostly software District it was mostly

3262
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:08,160
mostly software District it was mostly
 

3263
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:11,329
mostly software District it was mostly
software yeah absolutely absolutely so

software yeah absolutely absolutely so
 

3265
00:58:11,339 --> 00:58:14,150
software yeah absolutely absolutely so
but today uh IBM is very much this you

3266
00:58:14,150 --> 00:58:14,160
but today uh IBM is very much this you
 

3267
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:17,390
but today uh IBM is very much this you
know service most I.T services in the

3268
00:58:17,390 --> 00:58:17,400
know service most I.T services in the
 

3269
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:19,970
know service most I.T services in the
world has done by IBM there's so many so

many varied uh so basically if you have
 

3273
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:26,109
many varied uh so basically if you have
issues problems to solve in in business

3274
00:58:26,109 --> 00:58:26,119
issues problems to solve in in business
 

3275
00:58:26,119 --> 00:58:29,089
issues problems to solve in in business
uh in the software space IBM can help

3276
00:58:29,089 --> 00:58:29,099
uh in the software space IBM can help
 

3277
00:58:29,099 --> 00:58:32,270
uh in the software space IBM can help
yes and so in in that my last year uh

3278
00:58:32,270 --> 00:58:32,280
yes and so in in that my last year uh
 

3279
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:34,250
yes and so in in that my last year uh
our services business we broke it into

3280
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:34,260
our services business we broke it into
 

3281
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:36,650
our services business we broke it into
two pieces and one piece was spun off

3282
00:58:36,650 --> 00:58:36,660
two pieces and one piece was spun off
 

3283
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:38,210
two pieces and one piece was spun off
into a company called kindral which is

3284
00:58:38,210 --> 00:58:38,220
into a company called kindral which is
 

3285
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:40,490
into a company called kindral which is
managed Outsourcing

3286
00:58:40,490 --> 00:58:40,500
managed Outsourcing
 

3287
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:42,410
managed Outsourcing
um keeping things running and they're

3288
00:58:42,410 --> 00:58:42,420
um keeping things running and they're
 

3289
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:45,109
um keeping things running and they're
off creating their own company what IBM

3290
00:58:45,109 --> 00:58:45,119
off creating their own company what IBM
 

3291
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:46,849
off creating their own company what IBM
then retained is really the part I built

3292
00:58:46,849 --> 00:58:46,859
then retained is really the part I built
 

3293
00:58:46,859 --> 00:58:50,390
then retained is really the part I built
with pwcc the big Consulting arm and so

3294
00:58:50,390 --> 00:58:50,400
with pwcc the big Consulting arm and so
 

3295
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:53,630
with pwcc the big Consulting arm and so
today the IBM of today in 2023 is you

3296
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:53,640
today the IBM of today in 2023 is you
 

3297
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:55,910
today the IBM of today in 2023 is you
know at least ending 2022 was 30

3298
00:58:55,910 --> 00:58:55,920
know at least ending 2022 was 30
 

3299
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:59,150
know at least ending 2022 was 30
Consulting and the other 70 would be uh

3300
00:58:59,150 --> 00:58:59,160
Consulting and the other 70 would be uh
 

3301
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:00,829
Consulting and the other 70 would be uh
what would you consider software Cloud

3302
00:59:00,829 --> 00:59:00,839
what would you consider software Cloud
 

3303
00:59:00,839 --> 00:59:03,349
what would you consider software Cloud
AI so hybrid cloud and AI is the other

3304
00:59:03,349 --> 00:59:03,359
AI so hybrid cloud and AI is the other
 

3305
00:59:03,359 --> 00:59:05,569
AI so hybrid cloud and AI is the other
and some Hardware obviously still the

3306
00:59:05,569 --> 00:59:05,579
and some Hardware obviously still the
 

3307
00:59:05,579 --> 00:59:07,730
and some Hardware obviously still the
Mainframe is modernized Alive and

3308
00:59:07,730 --> 00:59:07,740
Mainframe is modernized Alive and
 

3309
00:59:07,740 --> 00:59:10,430
Mainframe is modernized Alive and
Kicking and still running some of the

3310
00:59:10,430 --> 00:59:10,440
Kicking and still running some of the
 

3311
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:12,890
Kicking and still running some of the
most important things of every Bank you

3312
00:59:12,890 --> 00:59:12,900
most important things of every Bank you
 

3313
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:14,870
most important things of every Bank you
can think of practically uh in the world

3314
00:59:14,870 --> 00:59:14,880
can think of practically uh in the world
 

3315
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:20,569
can think of practically uh in the world
and so that is the IBM of today versus

3316
00:59:20,569 --> 00:59:20,579
and so that is the IBM of today versus
 

3317
00:59:20,579 --> 00:59:23,150
and so that is the IBM of today versus
perhaps you know in red hat is a big

3318
00:59:23,150 --> 00:59:23,160
perhaps you know in red hat is a big
 

3319
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:24,710
perhaps you know in red hat is a big
piece and an important part of that

3320
00:59:24,710 --> 00:59:24,720
piece and an important part of that
 

3321
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:26,809
piece and an important part of that
software portfolio and they had some

3322
00:59:26,809 --> 00:59:26,819
software portfolio and they had some
 

3323
00:59:26,819 --> 00:59:28,370
software portfolio and they had some
services with them for implementation

3324
00:59:28,370 --> 00:59:28,380
services with them for implementation
 

3325
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:30,170
services with them for implementation
but it wasn't a very a very large part

3326
00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:30,180
but it wasn't a very a very large part
 

3327
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:33,049
but it wasn't a very a very large part
and it's it's grown by Leaps and Bounds

3328
00:59:33,049 --> 00:59:33,059
and it's it's grown by Leaps and Bounds
 

3329
00:59:33,059 --> 00:59:35,510
and it's it's grown by Leaps and Bounds
you know because originally the belief

3330
00:59:35,510 --> 00:59:35,520
you know because originally the belief
 

3331
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:36,530
you know because originally the belief
was everything was going to go to the

3332
00:59:36,530 --> 00:59:36,540
was everything was going to go to the
 

3333
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:38,930
was everything was going to go to the
public cloud and at least

3334
00:59:38,930 --> 00:59:38,940
public cloud and at least
 

3335
00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:41,329
public cloud and at least
many people thought that way

3336
00:59:41,329 --> 00:59:41,339
many people thought that way
 

3337
00:59:41,339 --> 00:59:43,789
many people thought that way
we didn't and in fact we I mean we tried

3338
00:59:43,789 --> 00:59:43,799
we didn't and in fact we I mean we tried
 

3339
00:59:43,799 --> 00:59:45,890
we didn't and in fact we I mean we tried
we cured a public Cloud company we

3340
00:59:45,890 --> 00:59:45,900
we cured a public Cloud company we
 

3341
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:47,089
we cured a public Cloud company we
really tried to work it but what we

3342
00:59:47,089 --> 00:59:47,099
really tried to work it but what we
 

3343
00:59:47,099 --> 00:59:49,010
really tried to work it but what we
found was a lot of the mission critical

3344
00:59:49,010 --> 00:59:49,020
found was a lot of the mission critical
 

3345
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:49,849
found was a lot of the mission critical
work

3346
00:59:49,849 --> 00:59:49,859
work
 

3347
00:59:49,859 --> 00:59:52,490
work
it it was tuned for Consumer World it

3348
00:59:52,490 --> 00:59:52,500
it it was tuned for Consumer World it
 

3349
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:55,849
it it was tuned for Consumer World it
wasn't tuned for the Enterprise so then

3350
00:59:55,849 --> 00:59:55,859
wasn't tuned for the Enterprise so then
 

3351
00:59:55,859 --> 00:59:58,370
wasn't tuned for the Enterprise so then
time is elapsing here though and you got

3352
00:59:58,370 --> 00:59:58,380
time is elapsing here though and you got
 

3353
00:59:58,380 --> 01:00:01,010
time is elapsing here though and you got
to be upscale and we didn't have any

3354
01:00:01,010 --> 01:00:01,020
to be upscale and we didn't have any
 

3355
01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:02,510
to be upscale and we didn't have any
application remember we're not an

3356
01:00:02,510 --> 01:00:02,520
application remember we're not an
 

3357
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:04,190
application remember we're not an
application company so it wasn't like we

3358
01:00:04,190 --> 01:00:04,200
application company so it wasn't like we
 

3359
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:06,890
application company so it wasn't like we
had an office we didn't have anything

3360
01:00:06,890 --> 01:00:06,900
had an office we didn't have anything
 

3361
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:08,870
had an office we didn't have anything
that like pulled things out to the cloud

3362
01:00:08,870 --> 01:00:08,880
that like pulled things out to the cloud
 

3363
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:11,510
that like pulled things out to the cloud
and so as we looked for what our best

3364
01:00:11,510 --> 01:00:11,520
and so as we looked for what our best
 

3365
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:13,730
and so as we looked for what our best
what we really back to who you are we

3366
01:00:13,730 --> 01:00:13,740
what we really back to who you are we
 

3367
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:15,530
what we really back to who you are we
really know Mission critical work we

3368
01:00:15,530 --> 01:00:15,540
really know Mission critical work we
 

3369
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:17,390
really know Mission critical work we
know where it lives today and we know

3370
01:00:17,390 --> 01:00:17,400
know where it lives today and we know
 

3371
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:19,370
know where it lives today and we know
how to make it live on the cloud which

3372
01:00:19,370 --> 01:00:19,380
how to make it live on the cloud which
 

3373
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:21,170
how to make it live on the cloud which
led us down hybrid Cloud you know that

3374
01:00:21,170 --> 01:00:21,180
led us down hybrid Cloud you know that
 

3375
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:22,670
led us down hybrid Cloud you know that
belief that the real world would turn

3376
01:00:22,670 --> 01:00:22,680
belief that the real world would turn
 

3377
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:25,309
belief that the real world would turn
into there'll be things on traditional

3378
01:00:25,309 --> 01:00:25,319
into there'll be things on traditional
 

3379
01:00:25,319 --> 01:00:26,809
into there'll be things on traditional
that'll you'll never move because it

3380
01:00:26,809 --> 01:00:26,819
that'll you'll never move because it
 

3381
01:00:26,819 --> 01:00:29,030
that'll you'll never move because it
doesn't make sense they'll be private

3382
01:00:29,030 --> 01:00:29,040
doesn't make sense they'll be private
 

3383
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:31,069
doesn't make sense they'll be private
clouds for you know have all the benefit

3384
01:00:31,069 --> 01:00:31,079
clouds for you know have all the benefit
 

3385
01:00:31,079 --> 01:00:32,510
clouds for you know have all the benefit
of the cloud but they just don't have

3386
01:00:32,510 --> 01:00:32,520
of the cloud but they just don't have
 

3387
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:34,670
of the cloud but they just don't have
you know infinite expansion and then

3388
01:00:34,670 --> 01:00:34,680
you know infinite expansion and then
 

3389
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:35,870
you know infinite expansion and then
they'll be public clouds and you're

3390
01:00:35,870 --> 01:00:35,880
they'll be public clouds and you're
 

3391
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:37,730
they'll be public clouds and you're
gonna have to connect them and be secure

3392
01:00:37,730 --> 01:00:37,740
gonna have to connect them and be secure
 

3393
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:39,710
gonna have to connect them and be secure
and that's what took us down the path

3394
01:00:39,710 --> 01:00:39,720
and that's what took us down the path
 

3395
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:41,750
and that's what took us down the path
with red hat that belief the structure

3396
01:00:41,750 --> 01:00:41,760
with red hat that belief the structure
 

3397
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:43,190
with red hat that belief the structure
of that is fundamentally different than

3398
01:00:43,190 --> 01:00:43,200
of that is fundamentally different than
 

3399
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:45,109
of that is fundamentally different than
something that's consumer facing so the

3400
01:00:45,109 --> 01:00:45,119
something that's consumer facing so the
 

3401
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:46,730
something that's consumer facing so the
the lesson you learn there is you can't

3402
01:00:46,730 --> 01:00:46,740
the lesson you learn there is you can't
 

3403
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:48,650
the lesson you learn there is you can't
just reuse something that that's

3404
01:00:48,650 --> 01:00:48,660
just reuse something that that's
 

3405
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:50,450
just reuse something that that's
optimized for consumers very interesting

3406
01:00:50,450 --> 01:00:50,460
optimized for consumers very interesting
 

3407
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:51,770
optimized for consumers very interesting
point doesn't mean consumer companies

3408
01:00:51,770 --> 01:00:51,780
point doesn't mean consumer companies
 

3409
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:52,670
point doesn't mean consumer companies
can't move up into the Enterprise

3410
01:00:52,670 --> 01:00:52,680
can't move up into the Enterprise
 

3411
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:54,950
can't move up into the Enterprise
because obviously they have right but I

3412
01:00:54,950 --> 01:00:54,960
because obviously they have right but I
 

3413
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:56,089
because obviously they have right but I
think it's very hard to take something

3414
01:00:56,089 --> 01:00:56,099
think it's very hard to take something
 

3415
01:00:56,099 --> 01:00:58,150
think it's very hard to take something
from the Enterprise and come on down

3416
01:00:58,150 --> 01:00:58,160
from the Enterprise and come on down
 

3417
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:00,410
from the Enterprise and come on down
because it got to be simple consumable

3418
01:01:00,410 --> 01:01:00,420
because it got to be simple consumable
 

3419
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:01,970
because it got to be simple consumable
all the things we talked about already

3420
01:01:01,970 --> 01:01:01,980
all the things we talked about already
 

3421
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:03,589
all the things we talked about already
plus you have to have the relationships

3422
01:01:03,589 --> 01:01:03,599
plus you have to have the relationships
 

3423
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:05,750
plus you have to have the relationships
with Enterprise yeah very different yeah

3424
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:05,760
with Enterprise yeah very different yeah
 

3425
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:07,130
with Enterprise yeah very different yeah
I mean you know our history right at one

3426
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:07,140
I mean you know our history right at one
 

3427
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:10,190
I mean you know our history right at one
time we had the PC business and you know

3428
01:01:10,190 --> 01:01:10,200
time we had the PC business and you know
 

3429
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:11,990
time we had the PC business and you know
the short answer to why would we would

3430
01:01:11,990 --> 01:01:12,000
the short answer to why would we would
 

3431
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,789
the short answer to why would we would
not do that is it's a consumer-facing

3432
01:01:13,789 --> 01:01:13,799
not do that is it's a consumer-facing
 

3433
01:01:13,799 --> 01:01:15,289
not do that is it's a consumer-facing
business we were good at the Enterprise

3434
01:01:15,289 --> 01:01:15,299
business we were good at the Enterprise
 

3435
01:01:15,299 --> 01:01:17,809
business we were good at the Enterprise
and that consumer business a highly

3436
01:01:17,809 --> 01:01:17,819
and that consumer business a highly
 

3437
01:01:17,819 --> 01:01:20,630
and that consumer business a highly
competitive got to be low cost all the

3438
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:20,640
competitive got to be low cost all the
 

3439
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:21,950
competitive got to be low cost all the
things that are not the same muscles

3440
01:01:21,950 --> 01:01:21,960
things that are not the same muscles
 

3441
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:24,410
things that are not the same muscles
necessarily of being in an innovation

3442
01:01:24,410 --> 01:01:24,420
necessarily of being in an innovation

places so
 

3467
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:50,930
places so
um that's what I mean consumer you know

3468
01:01:50,930 --> 01:01:50,940
um that's what I mean consumer you know
 

3469
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:52,309
um that's what I mean consumer you know
an end device and that was a big

3470
01:01:52,309 --> 01:01:52,319
an end device and that was a big
 

3471
01:01:52,319 --> 01:01:53,510
an end device and that was a big
decision because it would have been one

3472
01:01:53,510 --> 01:01:53,520
decision because it would have been one
 

3473
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:55,130
decision because it would have been one
of the last things that had our logo on

3474
01:01:55,130 --> 01:01:55,140
of the last things that had our logo on
 

3475
01:01:55,140 --> 01:01:56,930
of the last things that had our logo on
it that sits in your hands right so when

3476
01:01:56,930 --> 01:01:56,940
it that sits in your hands right so when
 

3477
01:01:56,940 --> 01:01:58,609
it that sits in your hands right so when
a new generation says what does IBM do

3478
01:01:58,609 --> 01:01:58,619
a new generation says what does IBM do
 

3479
01:01:58,619 --> 01:02:01,789
a new generation says what does IBM do
right was that a difficult decision

3480
01:02:01,789 --> 01:02:01,799
right was that a difficult decision
 

3481
01:02:01,799 --> 01:02:03,530
right was that a difficult decision
this is a long time ago now it's like

3482
01:02:03,530 --> 01:02:03,540
this is a long time ago now it's like
 

3483
01:02:03,540 --> 01:02:07,010
this is a long time ago now it's like
2005. yeah so um they're all difficult

3484
01:02:07,010 --> 01:02:07,020
2005. yeah so um they're all difficult
 

3485
01:02:07,020 --> 01:02:10,069
2005. yeah so um they're all difficult
because it's not only things as people

3486
01:02:10,069 --> 01:02:10,079
because it's not only things as people
 

3487
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:12,410
because it's not only things as people
um but it's back to knowing who you are

3488
01:02:12,410 --> 01:02:12,420
um but it's back to knowing who you are
 

3489
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:15,890
um but it's back to knowing who you are
is how I would sum that up as right and

3490
01:02:15,890 --> 01:02:15,900
is how I would sum that up as right and
 

3491
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:18,049
is how I would sum that up as right and
we were never great at making a lot of

3492
01:02:18,049 --> 01:02:18,059
we were never great at making a lot of
 

3493
01:02:18,059 --> 01:02:19,549
we were never great at making a lot of
money at that and you can remember

3494
01:02:19,549 --> 01:02:19,559
money at that and you can remember
 

3495
01:02:19,559 --> 01:02:21,410
money at that and you can remember
original as IBM PC than there were IBM

3496
01:02:21,410 --> 01:02:21,420
original as IBM PC than there were IBM
 

3497
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:23,809
original as IBM PC than there were IBM
clones or you they even called IBM

3498
01:02:23,809 --> 01:02:23,819
clones or you they even called IBM
 

3499
01:02:23,819 --> 01:02:25,370
clones or you they even called IBM
clones back then

3500
01:02:25,370 --> 01:02:25,380
clones back then
 

3501
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:27,589
clones back then
um as the field became highly highly

3502
01:02:27,589 --> 01:02:27,599
um as the field became highly highly
 

3503
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:30,109
um as the field became highly highly
competitive and as things commoditized

3504
01:02:30,109 --> 01:02:30,119
competitive and as things commoditized
 

3505
01:02:30,119 --> 01:02:32,990
competitive and as things commoditized
we often as they commoditize we would

3506
01:02:32,990 --> 01:02:33,000
we often as they commoditize we would
 

3507
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,030
we often as they commoditize we would
move them out and move on to the next

3508
01:02:35,030 --> 01:02:35,040
move them out and move on to the next
 

3509
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:36,890
move them out and move on to the next
Innovation level

3510
01:02:36,890 --> 01:02:36,900
Innovation level
 

3511
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:39,589
Innovation level
but because of that it's not as public

3512
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:39,599
but because of that it's not as public
 

3513
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:41,349
but because of that it's not as public
facing

facing
 

3515
01:02:41,359 --> 01:02:44,329
facing
the logos ever yeah isn't it true that

3516
01:02:44,329 --> 01:02:44,339
the logos ever yeah isn't it true that
 

3517
01:02:44,339 --> 01:02:47,089
the logos ever yeah isn't it true that
is very true that is actually a very

3518
01:02:47,089 --> 01:02:47,099
is very true that is actually a very
 

3519
01:02:47,099 --> 01:02:49,370
is very true that is actually a very
important point and that is you know

3520
01:02:49,370 --> 01:02:49,380
important point and that is you know
 

3521
01:02:49,380 --> 01:02:50,690
important point and that is you know
branding as you say one of the most

3522
01:02:50,690 --> 01:02:50,700
branding as you say one of the most
 

3523
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:53,210
branding as you say one of the most
recognizable in a in a very highly

3524
01:02:53,210 --> 01:02:53,220

and so
that's a trade-off I mean I can't you

3530
01:02:59,930 --> 01:02:59,940
that's a trade-off I mean I can't you

01:03:53,210 --> 01:03:53,220
right okay is that is that the process
 

3583
01:03:53,220 --> 01:03:55,069
right okay is that is that the process
of Consulting somewhat right so there's

3584
01:03:55,069 --> 01:03:55,079
of Consulting somewhat right so there's
 

3585
01:03:55,079 --> 01:03:57,049
of Consulting somewhat right so there's
that okay so fair enough when you say

3586
01:03:57,049 --> 01:03:57,059
that okay so fair enough when you say
 

3587
01:03:57,059 --> 01:03:58,430
that okay so fair enough when you say
that we're Consulting it's a really

3588
01:03:58,430 --> 01:03:58,440
that we're Consulting it's a really
 

3589
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:00,410
that we're Consulting it's a really
broad spectrum I mean I think people

3590
01:04:00,410 --> 01:04:00,420
broad spectrum I mean I think people
 

3591
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:01,670
broad spectrum I mean I think people
could be sitting here thinking it does

3592
01:04:01,670 --> 01:04:01,680
could be sitting here thinking it does
 

3593
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:03,950
could be sitting here thinking it does
any it could be I just give advice and I

3594
01:04:03,950 --> 01:04:03,960
any it could be I just give advice and I
 

3595
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:06,349
any it could be I just give advice and I
leave to all the way to I run your

3596
01:04:06,349 --> 01:04:06,359
leave to all the way to I run your
 

3597
01:04:06,359 --> 01:04:08,150
leave to all the way to I run your
systems right and I think it's it's

3598
01:04:08,150 --> 01:04:08,160
systems right and I think it's it's
 

3599
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:10,789
systems right and I think it's it's
generally people use the word to cover

3600
01:04:10,789 --> 01:04:10,799
generally people use the word to cover
 

3601
01:04:10,799 --> 01:04:13,789
generally people use the word to cover
everything in that in that space so we

3602
01:04:13,789 --> 01:04:13,799
everything in that in that space so we
 

3603
01:04:13,799 --> 01:04:16,069
everything in that in that space so we
sort of fit in the spot which is we

3604
01:04:16,069 --> 01:04:16,079
sort of fit in the spot which is we
 

3605
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:17,210
sort of fit in the spot which is we
would come in and live at that

3606
01:04:17,210 --> 01:04:17,220
would come in and live at that
 

3607
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:18,650
would come in and live at that
intersection of business and technology

3608
01:04:18,650 --> 01:04:18,660
intersection of business and technology
 

3609
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:19,789
intersection of business and technology
so yeah we could give you

3610
01:04:19,789 --> 01:04:19,799
so yeah we could give you
 

3611
01:04:19,799 --> 01:04:21,289
so yeah we could give you
recommendations and then we'd Implement

3612
01:04:21,289 --> 01:04:21,299
recommendations and then we'd Implement
 

3613
01:04:21,299 --> 01:04:22,490
recommendations and then we'd Implement
them and see them through because we

3614
01:04:22,490 --> 01:04:22,500
them and see them through because we
 

3615
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:23,750
them and see them through because we
have the technology to go to the

3616
01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:23,760
have the technology to go to the
 

3617
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:25,250
have the technology to go to the
implementation and see them through and

3618
01:04:25,250 --> 01:04:25,260
implementation and see them through and
 

3619
01:04:25,260 --> 01:04:27,710
implementation and see them through and
at the time back then that's what you

3620
01:04:27,710 --> 01:04:27,720
at the time back then that's what you
 

3621
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:29,210
at the time back then that's what you
know there have been five of those that

3622
01:04:29,210 --> 01:04:29,220
know there have been five of those that

others have ever succeeded before and um
yet on the other hand the great promise

3636
01:04:43,069 --> 01:04:43,079
yet on the other hand the great promise
 

3637
01:04:43,079 --> 01:04:45,589

was you could really clients were dying

3638
01:04:45,589 --> 01:04:45,599
was you could really clients were dying
 

3639
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:46,849
was you could really clients were dying
at that time when we were we're doing

3640
01:04:46,849 --> 01:04:46,859
at that time when we were we're doing
 

3641
01:04:46,859 --> 01:04:48,710
at that time when we were we're doing
that just to get more value out of their

3642
01:04:48,710 --> 01:04:48,720
that just to get more value out of their
 

3643
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:50,510
that just to get more value out of their
technology and have it really change the

3644
01:04:50,510 --> 01:04:50,520
technology and have it really change the
 

3645
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:52,670
technology and have it really change the
way the business worked so I think of it

3646
01:04:52,670 --> 01:04:52,680
way the business worked so I think of it

3650
01:04:55,490 --> 01:04:55,500
technology and see it all the way
 

3651
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:56,870
technology and see it all the way
through that's what we do today still

3652
01:04:56,870 --> 01:04:56,880
through that's what we do today still
 

3653
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:58,430
through that's what we do today still
yeah they see it all the way through

3654
01:04:58,430 --> 01:04:58,440
yeah they see it all the way through
 

3655
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:01,130
yeah they see it all the way through
yeah yes uh so let me say almost like a

3656
01:05:01,130 --> 01:05:01,140
yeah yes uh so let me say almost like a
 

3657
01:05:01,140 --> 01:05:03,289
yeah yes uh so let me say almost like a
personal question so that was a big

3658
01:05:03,289 --> 01:05:03,299
personal question so that was a big
 

3659
01:05:03,299 --> 01:05:05,569
personal question so that was a big
thing you were a part of that you led uh

3660
01:05:05,569 --> 01:05:05,579
thing you were a part of that you led uh

day the Consulting arm

3666
01:05:12,890 --> 01:05:12,900
day the Consulting arm

um of pricewaterhousecoopers for 3.5

3668
01:05:15,890 --> 01:05:15,900
um of pricewaterhousecoopers for 3.5
 

3669
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:18,470
um of pricewaterhousecoopers for 3.5
billion dollars so what was what were

3670
01:05:18,470 --> 01:05:18,480
billion dollars so what was what were
 

3671
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:19,789
billion dollars so what was what were
some of the challenges of that that you

3672
01:05:19,789 --> 01:05:19,799
some of the challenges of that that you
 

3673
01:05:19,799 --> 01:05:20,510
some of the challenges of that that you
remember

3674
01:05:20,510 --> 01:05:20,520
remember
 

3675
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:22,549
remember
personal and

3676
01:05:22,549 --> 01:05:22,559
personal and
 

3677
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:23,930
personal and
business

3678
01:05:23,930 --> 01:05:23,940
business
 

3679
01:05:23,940 --> 01:05:27,109
business
at that time PW had to die really had to

3680
01:05:27,109 --> 01:05:27,119
at that time PW had to die really had to
 

3681
01:05:27,119 --> 01:05:29,630
at that time PW had to die really had to
divest and so they were in parallel

3682
01:05:29,630 --> 01:05:29,640
divest and so they were in parallel
 

3683
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:32,329
divest and so they were in parallel
going to IPO right so we sort of swept

3684
01:05:32,329 --> 01:05:32,339
going to IPO right so we sort of swept
 

3685
01:05:32,339 --> 01:05:33,770
going to IPO right so we sort of swept
in at that point and said and we'd been

3686
01:05:33,770 --> 01:05:33,780
in at that point and said and we'd been
 

3687
01:05:33,780 --> 01:05:36,049
in at that point and said and we'd been
thinking about it a long time and uh

3688
01:05:36,049 --> 01:05:36,059
thinking about it a long time and uh
 

3689
01:05:36,059 --> 01:05:37,670
thinking about it a long time and uh
started to to work on that as an

3690
01:05:37,670 --> 01:05:37,680
started to to work on that as an
 

3691
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:39,230
started to to work on that as an
acquisition so you know kind of

3692
01:05:39,230 --> 01:05:39,240
acquisition so you know kind of
 

3693
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:41,150
acquisition so you know kind of
balancing which way would they go IPO or

3694
01:05:41,150 --> 01:05:41,160
balancing which way would they go IPO or
 

3695
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:43,309
balancing which way would they go IPO or
acquisition and so the challenges are

3696
01:05:43,309 --> 01:05:43,319
acquisition and so the challenges are
 

3697
01:05:43,319 --> 01:05:45,170
acquisition and so the challenges are
obvious and part of it's why they went

3698
01:05:45,170 --> 01:05:45,180
obvious and part of it's why they went
 

3699
01:05:45,180 --> 01:05:47,150
obvious and part of it's why they went
with us as an acquisition big difference

3700
01:05:47,150 --> 01:05:47,160
with us as an acquisition big difference
 

3701
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:49,130
with us as an acquisition big difference

answered 143 quarters okay that's a

3710
01:05:56,809 --> 01:05:56,819
answered 143 quarters okay that's a

model right
um so we had the challenges of being

3716
01:06:02,030 --> 01:06:02,040
um so we had the challenges of being
 

3717
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:04,190
um so we had the challenges of being
private versus public you have the

3718
01:06:04,190 --> 01:06:04,200
private versus public you have the
 

3719
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:05,450
private versus public you have the
challenge of when you acquire something

3720
01:06:05,450 --> 01:06:05,460
challenge of when you acquire something
 

3721
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:07,250
challenge of when you acquire something
like that as I say you acquire Hearts

3722
01:06:07,250 --> 01:06:07,260
like that as I say you acquire Hearts
 

3723
01:06:07,260 --> 01:06:08,930
like that as I say you acquire Hearts
not Parts

3724
01:06:08,930 --> 01:06:08,940
not Parts
 

3725
01:06:08,940 --> 01:06:10,910
not Parts
um they could leave I mean you could

3726
01:06:10,910 --> 01:06:10,920
um they could leave I mean you could
 

3727
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:13,130
um they could leave I mean you could
destroy your value by them leaving they

3728
01:06:13,130 --> 01:06:13,140
destroy your value by them leaving they
 

3729

3732
01:06:17,030 --> 01:06:17,040
you can put you know lots of restraints
 

3733
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:19,549
you can put you know lots of restraints
but still uh that you have there and

3734
01:06:19,549 --> 01:06:19,559
but still uh that you have there and
 

3735
01:06:19,559 --> 01:06:20,870
but still uh that you have there and
then we had to really build a new

3736
01:06:20,870 --> 01:06:20,880
then we had to really build a new

willing to pay for and so we had to do
 

3743
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:29,210
willing to pay for and so we had to do
something that lived at that

3744
01:06:29,210 --> 01:06:29,220
something that lived at that
 

3745
01:06:29,220 --> 01:06:31,250
something that lived at that
intersection and say that how this was

3746

intersection and say that how this was
unique is what we were doing so you had

01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:37,070
really fast and and so that ability up a
lot of challenges you pick them up right

3927
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:51,349
learned that when people don't believe
they can do something they probably

3928
01:09:51,349 --> 01:09:51,359
they can do something they probably
 

3929
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:54,530
they can do something they probably
won't do it so you know we wanted to run

3930
01:09:54,530 --> 01:09:54,540
won't do it so you know we wanted to run
 

3931
01:09:54,540 --> 01:09:56,209

the business at a certain level I I

3932
01:09:56,209 --> 01:09:56,219
the business at a certain level I I
 

3933
01:09:56,219 --> 01:09:57,770
the business at a certain level I I
really did have some great leaders but

3934
01:09:57,770 --> 01:09:57,780
really did have some great leaders but
 

3935
01:09:57,780 --> 01:09:59,450
really did have some great leaders but
they didn't really believe it could do

3936
01:09:59,450 --> 01:09:59,460
they didn't really believe it could do
 

3937
01:09:59,460 --> 01:10:00,830
they didn't really believe it could do
that and I finally had to come to terms

3938
01:10:00,830 --> 01:10:00,840
that and I finally had to come to terms
 

3939
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:02,030
that and I finally had to come to terms
with if you don't really believe in

3940
01:10:02,030 --> 01:10:02,040
with if you don't really believe in
 

3941
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:03,229
with if you don't really believe in
something you really aren't going to

3942
01:10:03,229 --> 01:10:03,239
something you really aren't going to
 

3943
01:10:03,239 --> 01:10:04,370
something you really aren't going to
probably make it happen at the end of

3944
01:10:04,370 --> 01:10:04,380
probably make it happen at the end of
 

3945
01:10:04,380 --> 01:10:06,950
probably make it happen at the end of
the day and so

did things that helped that I mean I
 

4047
01:11:57,420 --> 01:11:59,270
did things that helped that I mean I
knew that people joining us would feel

4048
01:11:59,270 --> 01:11:59,280
knew that people joining us would feel
 

4049
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:00,470
knew that people joining us would feel
more comfortable if they had people

4050
01:12:00,470 --> 01:12:00,480
more comfortable if they had people
 

4051
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:03,890
more comfortable if they had people
leading it that they recognized Etc but

4052
01:12:03,890 --> 01:12:03,900
leading it that they recognized Etc but
 

4053
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:04,610
leading it that they recognized Etc but
um

4054
01:12:04,610 --> 01:12:04,620
um
 

4055
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:06,950
um
again I learned those that didn't then I

4056
01:12:06,950 --> 01:12:06,960
again I learned those that didn't then I
 

4057
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:08,750
again I learned those that didn't then I
eventually had to take you know some

4058
01:12:08,750 --> 01:12:08,760
eventually had to take you know some
 

4059
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:11,149
eventually had to take you know some
action out but but pwcc had a lot of

4060
01:12:11,149 --> 01:12:11,159
action out but but pwcc had a lot of
 

4061
01:12:11,159 --> 01:12:14,030
action out but but pwcc had a lot of
really dedicated leaders to it and uh I

4062
01:12:14,030 --> 01:12:14,040
really dedicated leaders to it and uh I
 

4063
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:16,130
really dedicated leaders to it and uh I
I give them a lot of credit well it's

4064
01:12:16,130 --> 01:12:16,140
I give them a lot of credit well it's
 

4065
01:12:16,140 --> 01:12:17,630
I give them a lot of credit well it's
amazing to see a thing that kind of

4066
01:12:17,630 --> 01:12:17,640
amazing to see a thing that kind of
 

4067
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:20,870
amazing to see a thing that kind of
start at that that very stressful time

4068
01:12:20,870 --> 01:12:20,880
start at that that very stressful time
 

4069
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:22,490
start at that that very stressful time
and then it turns out to be a success

4070
01:12:22,490 --> 01:12:22,500
and then it turns out to be a success
 

4071
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:24,350
and then it turns out to be a success
yeah that's that's just beautiful to see

4072
01:12:24,350 --> 01:12:24,360
yeah that's that's just beautiful to see
 

4073
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:26,990
yeah that's that's just beautiful to see
so uh what about the acquisition itself

4074
01:12:26,990 --> 01:12:27,000
so uh what about the acquisition itself
 

4075
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,250
so uh what about the acquisition itself
is there something interesting to say

4076
01:12:28,250 --> 01:12:28,260
is there something interesting to say
 

4077
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:30,530
is there something interesting to say
about the like what you learn about

4078
01:12:30,530 --> 01:12:30,540
about the like what you learn about
 

4079
01:12:30,540 --> 01:12:32,390
about the like what you learn about
maybe negotiation because there's a lot

4080
01:12:32,390 --> 01:12:32,400
maybe negotiation because there's a lot
 

4081
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:34,970
maybe negotiation because there's a lot
of money involved too to me it was a

4082
01:12:34,970 --> 01:12:34,980
of money involved too to me it was a
 

4083
01:12:34,980 --> 01:12:38,209
of money involved too to me it was a
win-win and we both actually cared the

4084
01:12:38,209 --> 01:12:38,219
win-win and we both actually cared the
 

4085
01:12:38,219 --> 01:12:39,709
win-win and we both actually cared the
customers got value so there was this

4086
01:12:39,709 --> 01:12:39,719
customers got value so there was this
 

4087
01:12:39,719 --> 01:12:42,530
customers got value so there was this
like third thing that had a benefit not

4088
01:12:42,530 --> 01:12:42,540
like third thing that had a benefit not
 

4089
01:12:42,540 --> 01:12:44,330
like third thing that had a benefit not
them not a there was this third thing

4090
01:12:44,330 --> 01:12:44,340
them not a there was this third thing
 

4091
01:12:44,340 --> 01:12:47,470
them not a there was this third thing
and then you think that

4092
01:12:47,470 --> 01:12:47,480
and then you think that
 

4093
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:49,729
and then you think that
people would have the wisdom of what

4094
01:12:49,729 --> 01:12:49,739
people would have the wisdom of what
 

4095
01:12:49,739 --> 01:12:51,290
people would have the wisdom of what
what it takes to have great negotiation

4096
01:12:51,290 --> 01:12:51,300
what it takes to have great negotiation
 

4097
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:53,330
what it takes to have great negotiation
but yeah so it's a win-win is is one of

4098
01:12:53,330 --> 01:12:53,340
but yeah so it's a win-win is is one of
 

4099
01:12:53,340 --> 01:12:55,490
but yeah so it's a win-win is is one of
the ways you can have this but it's like

4100
01:12:55,490 --> 01:12:55,500
the ways you can have this but it's like
 

4101
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:57,169
the ways you can have this but it's like
obvious to even say that right I mean if

4102
01:12:57,169 --> 01:12:57,179
obvious to even say that right I mean if
 

4103
01:12:57,179 --> 01:12:58,669
obvious to even say that right I mean if
you can back to being in service of

4104
01:12:58,669 --> 01:12:58,679
you can back to being in service of
 

4105
01:12:58,679 --> 01:13:00,110
you can back to being in service of
something we were both in service of

4106
01:13:00,110 --> 01:13:00,120
something we were both in service of
 

4107
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:03,110
something we were both in service of
clients so in and then

4108
01:13:03,110 --> 01:13:03,120
clients so in and then
 

4109
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:05,209
clients so in and then
you know I always say

4110
01:13:05,209 --> 01:13:05,219
you know I always say
 

4111
01:13:05,219 --> 01:13:08,149
you know I always say
when you have a negotiation with someone

4112
01:13:08,149 --> 01:13:08,159
when you have a negotiation with someone
 

4113
01:13:08,159 --> 01:13:09,649
when you have a negotiation with someone
um okay both parties always kind of walk

4114
01:13:09,649 --> 01:13:09,659
um okay both parties always kind of walk
 

4115
01:13:09,659 --> 01:13:11,990
um okay both parties always kind of walk
away a little bit okay that's good if

4116
01:13:11,990 --> 01:13:12,000
away a little bit okay that's good if
 

4117
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,490
away a little bit okay that's good if
they both walk away going God I should

4118
01:13:13,490 --> 01:13:13,500
they both walk away going God I should
 

4119
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:14,870
they both walk away going God I should
have got a little bit more okay but it's

4120
01:13:14,870 --> 01:13:14,880
have got a little bit more okay but it's
 

4121
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:16,189
have got a little bit more okay but it's
okay but I should have got okay they're

4122
01:13:16,189 --> 01:13:16,199
okay but I should have got okay they're
 

4123
01:13:16,199 --> 01:13:18,410
okay but I should have got okay they're
both a little a little fussy when one

4124
01:13:18,410 --> 01:13:18,420
both a little a little fussy when one
 

4125
01:13:18,420 --> 01:13:19,850
both a little a little fussy when one
walks away and thinks they did great and

4126
01:13:19,850 --> 01:13:19,860
walks away and thinks they did great and
 

4127
01:13:19,860 --> 01:13:21,169
walks away and thinks they did great and
the other one did horrible they usually

4128
01:13:21,169 --> 01:13:21,179
the other one did horrible they usually
 

4129
01:13:21,179 --> 01:13:24,229
the other one did horrible they usually
is like born bad I mean because they

4130
01:13:24,229 --> 01:13:24,239
is like born bad I mean because they
 

4131
01:13:24,239 --> 01:13:26,209
is like born bad I mean because they
never work that way and I've always felt

4132
01:13:26,209 --> 01:13:26,219
never work that way and I've always felt
 

4133
01:13:26,219 --> 01:13:29,510
never work that way and I've always felt
that way with negotiations that um

4134
01:13:29,510 --> 01:13:29,520
that way with negotiations that um
 

4135
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:31,990
that way with negotiations that um
you push too far down you will you

4136
01:13:31,990 --> 01:13:32,000
you push too far down you will you
 

4137
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,689
you push too far down you will you
usually will be sorry you did that you

4138
01:13:35,689 --> 01:13:35,699
usually will be sorry you did that you
 

4139
01:13:35,699 --> 01:13:37,850
usually will be sorry you did that you
know so don't push too far I mean that's

4140
01:13:37,850 --> 01:13:37,860
know so don't push too far I mean that's
 

4141
01:13:37,860 --> 01:13:39,470
know so don't push too far I mean that's
ultimately what collaboration and

4142
01:13:39,470 --> 01:13:39,480
ultimately what collaboration and
 

4143
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:42,410
ultimately what collaboration and
empathy means is you you're interested

4144
01:13:42,410 --> 01:13:42,420
empathy means is you you're interested
 

4145
01:13:42,420 --> 01:13:43,970
empathy means is you you're interested
in in the long-term success of everybody

4146
01:13:43,970 --> 01:13:43,980
in in the long-term success of everybody
 

4147
01:13:43,980 --> 01:13:46,189
in in the long-term success of everybody
together versus like your short time and

4148
01:13:46,189 --> 01:13:46,199
together versus like your short time and
 

4149
01:13:46,199 --> 01:13:47,390
together versus like your short time and
then you get the discretionary energy

4150
01:13:47,390 --> 01:13:47,400
then you get the discretionary energy
 

4151
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:49,189
then you get the discretionary energy
from them versus like okay you you

4152
01:13:49,189 --> 01:13:49,199
from them versus like okay you you
 

4153
01:13:49,199 --> 01:13:51,649
from them versus like okay you you
screwed me here I'm done right

4154
01:13:51,649 --> 01:13:51,659
screwed me here I'm done right
 

4155
01:13:51,659 --> 01:13:55,610
screwed me here I'm done right
so let's even rewind even back uh no oh

4156
01:13:55,610 --> 01:13:55,620
so let's even rewind even back uh no oh
 

4157
01:13:55,620 --> 01:13:57,890
so let's even rewind even back uh no oh
no so do you feel like this is a

4158
01:13:57,890 --> 01:13:57,900
no so do you feel like this is a
 

4159
01:13:57,900 --> 01:14:00,470
no so do you feel like this is a
Nostalgia interview oh no let me just

4160
01:14:00,470 --> 01:14:00,480
Nostalgia interview oh no let me just
 

4161
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:01,790
Nostalgia interview oh no let me just
ask the Romantic question what did you

4162
01:14:01,790 --> 01:14:01,800
ask the Romantic question what did you
 

4163
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:03,290
ask the Romantic question what did you
love most about engineering computer

4164
01:14:03,290 --> 01:14:03,300
love most about engineering computer
 

4165
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:05,270
love most about engineering computer
science electrical engineering so in

4166
01:14:05,270 --> 01:14:05,280
science electrical engineering so in
 

4167
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:07,189
science electrical engineering so in
those early days from your degree to the

4168
01:14:07,189 --> 01:14:07,199
those early days from your degree to the
 

4169
01:14:07,199 --> 01:14:10,729
those early days from your degree to the
to the earth I I love that logic part of

4170
01:14:10,729 --> 01:14:10,739
to the earth I I love that logic part of
 

4171
01:14:10,739 --> 01:14:12,590
to the earth I I love that logic part of
it right and you do get a sense of

4172
01:14:12,590 --> 01:14:12,600
it right and you do get a sense of
 

4173
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:14,330
it right and you do get a sense of
completion at some point when you reach

4174
01:14:14,330 --> 01:14:14,340
completion at some point when you reach
 

4175
01:14:14,340 --> 01:14:16,130
completion at some point when you reach
certain Milestones you know like yes it

4176
01:14:16,130 --> 01:14:16,140
certain Milestones you know like yes it
 

4177
01:14:16,140 --> 01:14:19,490
certain Milestones you know like yes it
worked or yes it you know that finite

4178
01:14:19,490 --> 01:14:19,500
worked or yes it you know that finite
 

4179
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:21,110
worked or yes it you know that finite
answer to that so that's what I loved

4180
01:14:21,110 --> 01:14:21,120
answer to that so that's what I loved
 

4181
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:22,970
answer to that so that's what I loved
about it I loved the problem solving of

4182
01:14:22,970 --> 01:14:22,980
about it I loved the problem solving of
 

4183
01:14:22,980 --> 01:14:25,250
about it I loved the problem solving of
it Computing what led you down that path

4184
01:14:25,250 --> 01:14:25,260
it Computing what led you down that path
 

4185
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:26,990
it Computing what led you down that path
what Computing in general what made you

4186
01:14:26,990 --> 01:14:27,000
what Computing in general what made you
 

4187
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,149
what Computing in general what made you
fall in love with with Computing with

4188
01:14:29,149 --> 01:14:29,159
fall in love with with Computing with
 

4189
01:14:29,159 --> 01:14:30,350
fall in love with with Computing with
engineering

4190
01:14:30,350 --> 01:14:30,360
engineering
 

4191
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:32,630
engineering
it's probably that back to that desire

4192
01:14:32,630 --> 01:14:32,640
it's probably that back to that desire
 

4193
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:34,550
it's probably that back to that desire
wanting to know how things work right

4194
01:14:34,550 --> 01:14:34,560
wanting to know how things work right
 

4195
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:36,290
wanting to know how things work right
and so that's like a natural thing you

4196
01:14:36,290 --> 01:14:36,300
and so that's like a natural thing you
 

4197
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:38,090
and so that's like a natural thing you
know math I loved math for that reason I

4198
01:14:38,090 --> 01:14:38,100
know math I loved math for that reason I
 

4199
01:14:38,100 --> 01:14:39,649
know math I loved math for that reason I
always wanted to study how did that you

4200
01:14:39,649 --> 01:14:39,659
always wanted to study how did that you
 

4201
01:14:39,659 --> 01:14:41,570
always wanted to study how did that you
know how did it get that to work kind of

4202
01:14:41,570 --> 01:14:41,580
know how did it get that to work kind of
 

4203
01:14:41,580 --> 01:14:44,930
know how did it get that to work kind of
thing so it goes back in that time but I

4204
01:14:44,930 --> 01:14:44,940
thing so it goes back in that time but I
 

4205
01:14:44,940 --> 01:14:46,910
thing so it goes back in that time but I
did start when I went when I started I

4206
01:14:46,910 --> 01:14:46,920
did start when I went when I started I
 

4207
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:48,229
did start when I went when I started I
wasn't I was already in the engineering

4208
01:14:48,229 --> 01:14:48,239
wasn't I was already in the engineering
 

4209
01:14:48,239 --> 01:14:49,850
wasn't I was already in the engineering
school but my first thought was to be a

4210
01:14:49,850 --> 01:14:49,860
school but my first thought was to be a
 

4211
01:14:49,860 --> 01:14:51,590
school but my first thought was to be a
doctor that that was far more noble that

4212
01:14:51,590 --> 01:14:51,600
doctor that that was far more noble that
 

4213
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:53,630
doctor that that was far more noble that
I should be a medical doctor until I

4214
01:14:53,630 --> 01:14:53,640
I should be a medical doctor until I
 

4215
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:55,430
I should be a medical doctor until I
could not pass human reproduction as a

4216
01:14:55,430 --> 01:14:55,440
could not pass human reproduction as a
 

4217
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:57,590
could not pass human reproduction as a
course and I thought the irony that I

4218
01:14:57,590 --> 01:14:57,600
course and I thought the irony that I
 

4219
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:59,390
course and I thought the irony that I
could not I'm like I got all these

4220
01:14:59,390 --> 01:14:59,400
could not I'm like I got all these
 

4221
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:00,950
could not I'm like I got all these
colored pencils I got these pictures

4222
01:15:00,950 --> 01:15:00,960
colored pencils I got these pictures
 

4223
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:02,450
colored pencils I got these pictures
this is not working I'm going to stick

4224
01:15:02,450 --> 01:15:02,460
this is not working I'm going to stick
 

4225
01:15:02,460 --> 01:15:04,790
this is not working I'm going to stick
to math it was the only course in my

4226
01:15:04,790 --> 01:15:04,800
to math it was the only course in my
 

4227
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:06,649
to math it was the only course in my
four-year college education I had to

4228
01:15:06,649 --> 01:15:06,659
four-year college education I had to
 

4229
01:15:06,659 --> 01:15:08,870
four-year college education I had to
take pass fail because otherwise I I

4230
01:15:08,870 --> 01:15:08,880
take pass fail because otherwise I I
 

4231
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:11,149
take pass fail because otherwise I I
risked you know impairing my uh my my

4232
01:15:11,149 --> 01:15:11,159
risked you know impairing my uh my my
 

4233
01:15:11,159 --> 01:15:13,790
risked you know impairing my uh my my
grade point average engineering it is so

4234
01:15:13,790 --> 01:15:13,800
grade point average engineering it is so
 

4235
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:16,370
grade point average engineering it is so
but after about 10 years you jumped from

4236
01:15:16,370 --> 01:15:16,380
but after about 10 years you jumped from
 

4237
01:15:16,380 --> 01:15:18,350
but after about 10 years you jumped from
the technical world of systems engineer

4238
01:15:18,350 --> 01:15:18,360
the technical world of systems engineer
 

4239
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:21,830
the technical world of systems engineer
to a management a leadership role did

4240
01:15:21,830 --> 01:15:21,840
to a management a leadership role did
 

4241
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:23,689
to a management a leadership role did
you miss at that time the sort of the

4242
01:15:23,689 --> 01:15:23,699
you miss at that time the sort of the
 

4243
01:15:23,699 --> 01:15:25,130
you miss at that time the sort of the
technical direct contribution versus

4244
01:15:25,130 --> 01:15:25,140
technical direct contribution versus
 

4245
01:15:25,140 --> 01:15:27,830
technical direct contribution versus
being a leader a manager that's an

4246
01:15:27,830 --> 01:15:27,840
being a leader a manager that's an
 

4247
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:29,330
being a leader a manager that's an
interesting point like I like I say I've

4248
01:15:29,330 --> 01:15:29,340
interesting point like I like I say I've
 

4249
01:15:29,340 --> 01:15:31,610
interesting point like I like I say I've
always been sort of a do leader you know

4250
01:15:31,610 --> 01:15:31,620
always been sort of a do leader you know
 

4251
01:15:31,620 --> 01:15:34,790
always been sort of a do leader you know
so she never lost it I never really did

4252
01:15:34,790 --> 01:15:34,800
so she never lost it I never really did
 

4253
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:37,850
so she never lost it I never really did
even you know and I think this is like

4254
01:15:37,850 --> 01:15:37,860
even you know and I think this is like
 

4255
01:15:37,860 --> 01:15:39,890
even you know and I think this is like
really important for today the best way

4256
01:15:39,890 --> 01:15:39,900
really important for today the best way
 

4257
01:15:39,900 --> 01:15:42,229
really important for today the best way
people learn is experientially I think

4258
01:15:42,229 --> 01:15:42,239
people learn is experientially I think
 

4259
01:15:42,239 --> 01:15:43,850
people learn is experientially I think
now you may there that's being a

4260
01:15:43,850 --> 01:15:43,860
now you may there that's being a
 

4261
01:15:43,860 --> 01:15:45,110
now you may there that's being a
generalization because their people can

4262
01:15:45,110 --> 01:15:45,120
generalization because their people can
 

4263
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:46,970
generalization because their people can
learn all different ways right

4264
01:15:46,970 --> 01:15:46,980
learn all different ways right
 

4265
01:15:46,980 --> 01:15:49,490
learn all different ways right
so I've done things like with my whole

4266
01:15:49,490 --> 01:15:49,500
so I've done things like with my whole
 

4267
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:50,510
so I've done things like with my whole
team

4268
01:15:50,510 --> 01:15:50,520
team
 

4269
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:52,189
team
they all had to learn how to build Cloud

4270
01:15:52,189 --> 01:15:52,199
they all had to learn how to build Cloud
 

4271
01:15:52,199 --> 01:15:53,990
they all had to learn how to build Cloud
applications

4272
01:15:53,990 --> 01:15:54,000
applications
 

4273
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,290
applications
we called it codoff and so you know I

4274
01:15:57,290 --> 01:15:57,300
we called it codoff and so you know I
 

4275
01:15:57,300 --> 01:15:59,209
we called it codoff and so you know I
don't care what your job is write code

4276
01:15:59,209 --> 01:15:59,219
don't care what your job is write code
 

4277
01:15:59,219 --> 01:16:02,149
don't care what your job is write code
you know and uh I remember when we were

4278
01:16:02,149 --> 01:16:02,159
you know and uh I remember when we were
 

4279
01:16:02,159 --> 01:16:03,169
you know and uh I remember when we were
trying to get the company to understand

4280
01:16:03,169 --> 01:16:03,179
trying to get the company to understand
 

4281
01:16:03,179 --> 01:16:05,810
trying to get the company to understand
AI we did something called a cognitive

4282
01:16:05,810 --> 01:16:05,820
AI we did something called a cognitive
 

4283
01:16:05,820 --> 01:16:07,790
AI we did something called a cognitive
Jam okay there's a reason we picked the

4284
01:16:07,790 --> 01:16:07,800
Jam okay there's a reason we picked the
 

4285
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:09,410
Jam okay there's a reason we picked the
word cognitive by the way instead of AI

4286
01:16:09,410 --> 01:16:09,420
word cognitive by the way instead of AI
 

4287
01:16:09,420 --> 01:16:11,810
word cognitive by the way instead of AI
today we use the word AI

4288
01:16:11,810 --> 01:16:11,820
today we use the word AI
 

4289
01:16:11,820 --> 01:16:15,229
today we use the word AI
it was really symbolic it was to mean

4290
01:16:15,229 --> 01:16:15,239
it was really symbolic it was to mean
 

4291
01:16:15,239 --> 01:16:17,390
it was really symbolic it was to mean
this is to help you think not replace

4292
01:16:17,390 --> 01:16:17,400
this is to help you think not replace
 

4293
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:18,890
this is to help you think not replace
your thinking there was so much in the

4294
01:16:18,890 --> 01:16:18,900
your thinking there was so much in the
 

4295
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:21,470
your thinking there was so much in the
Zeitgeist about AI being a bad thing at

4296
01:16:21,470 --> 01:16:21,480
Zeitgeist about AI being a bad thing at
 

4297
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:23,270
Zeitgeist about AI being a bad thing at
that time so that was why we picked a

4298
01:16:23,270 --> 01:16:23,280
that time so that was why we picked a
 

4299
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:25,370
that time so that was why we picked a
mouthful of a word like cognitive and it

4300
01:16:25,370 --> 01:16:25,380
mouthful of a word like cognitive and it
 

4301
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:26,990
mouthful of a word like cognitive and it
was like no no this is to help you

4302
01:16:26,990 --> 01:16:27,000
was like no no this is to help you
 

4303
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,390
was like no no this is to help you
actually so do what you know do what you

4304
01:16:29,390 --> 01:16:29,400
actually so do what you know do what you
 

4305
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:30,890
actually so do what you know do what you
do better or do something you haven't

4306
01:16:30,890 --> 01:16:30,900
do better or do something you haven't
 

4307
01:16:30,900 --> 01:16:33,169
do better or do something you haven't
yet learned and uh we did something

4308
01:16:33,169 --> 01:16:33,179
yet learned and uh we did something
 

4309
01:16:33,179 --> 01:16:35,149
yet learned and uh we did something
called the cognitive Jam but the whole

4310
01:16:35,149 --> 01:16:35,159
called the cognitive Jam but the whole
 

4311
01:16:35,159 --> 01:16:36,410
called the cognitive Jam but the whole
point was everybody in the company could

4312
01:16:36,410 --> 01:16:36,420
point was everybody in the company could
 

4313
01:16:36,420 --> 01:16:38,270
point was everybody in the company could
volunteer get on a team you either had

4314
01:16:38,270 --> 01:16:38,280
volunteer get on a team you either had
 

4315
01:16:38,280 --> 01:16:39,950
volunteer get on a team you either had
to build something that improved to one

4316
01:16:39,950 --> 01:16:39,960
to build something that improved to one
 

4317
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:41,930
to build something that improved to one
of our products or did something for a

4318
01:16:41,930 --> 01:16:41,940
of our products or did something for a
 

4319
01:16:41,940 --> 01:16:43,570
of our products or did something for a
client or did a social

4320
01:16:43,570 --> 01:16:43,580
client or did a social
 

4321
01:16:43,580 --> 01:16:45,950
client or did a social
issue with AI

4322
01:16:45,950 --> 01:16:45,960
issue with AI
 

4323
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:49,310
issue with AI
and again this goes back now

4324
01:16:49,310 --> 01:16:49,320
and again this goes back now
 

4325
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:52,430
and again this goes back now
10 years and people did things from

4326
01:16:52,430 --> 01:16:52,440
10 years and people did things from
 

4327
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:54,530
10 years and people did things from
bullying applications to you know

4328
01:16:54,530 --> 01:16:54,540
bullying applications to you know
 

4329
01:16:54,540 --> 01:16:56,990
bullying applications to you know
railroad stuff to whatever it was but it

4330
01:16:56,990 --> 01:16:57,000
railroad stuff to whatever it was but it
 

4331
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,450
railroad stuff to whatever it was but it
got like a hundred thousand people to

4332
01:16:59,450 --> 01:16:59,460
got like a hundred thousand people to
 

4333
01:16:59,460 --> 01:17:01,790
got like a hundred thousand people to
understand you know viscerally what is

4334
01:17:01,790 --> 01:17:01,800
understand you know viscerally what is
 

4335
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:04,430
understand you know viscerally what is
AI so that's a long answer to my belief

4336
01:17:04,430 --> 01:17:04,440
AI so that's a long answer to my belief
 

4337
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:06,350
AI so that's a long answer to my belief
around experiential and so do you ever

4338
01:17:06,350 --> 01:17:06,360
around experiential and so do you ever
 

4339
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:08,689
around experiential and so do you ever
give it up I I don't think so because I

4340
01:17:08,689 --> 01:17:08,699
give it up I I don't think so because I
 

4341
01:17:08,699 --> 01:17:10,070
give it up I I don't think so because I
actually think that's pretty good to get

4342
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:10,080
actually think that's pretty good to get
 

4343
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:11,930
actually think that's pretty good to get
your hands dirty in something you know

4344
01:17:11,930 --> 01:17:11,940
your hands dirty in something you know
 

4345
01:17:11,940 --> 01:17:14,030
your hands dirty in something you know
you can't do it you know depending what

4346
01:17:14,030 --> 01:17:14,040
you can't do it you know depending what
 

4347
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:15,649
you can't do it you know depending what
you're doing your effort to do that will

4348
01:17:15,649 --> 01:17:15,659
you're doing your effort to do that will
 

4349
01:17:15,659 --> 01:17:17,990
you're doing your effort to do that will
be less but so even a CEO you tried to

4350
01:17:17,990 --> 01:17:18,000
be less but so even a CEO you tried to
 

4351
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,169
be less but so even a CEO you tried to
always get your hands

4352
01:17:20,169 --> 01:17:20,179
always get your hands
 

4353
01:17:20,179 --> 01:17:23,090
always get your hands
I've played I mean still yeah I'm not

4354
01:17:23,090 --> 01:17:23,100
I've played I mean still yeah I'm not
 

4355
01:17:23,100 --> 01:17:25,010
I've played I mean still yeah I'm not
saying I'm any good at any of it you

4356
01:17:25,010 --> 01:17:25,020
saying I'm any good at any of it you
 

4357
01:17:25,020 --> 01:17:26,590
saying I'm any good at any of it you
know anymore but to build up intuition

4358
01:17:26,590 --> 01:17:26,600
know anymore but to build up intuition
 

4359
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:29,570
know anymore but to build up intuition
yeah it's that really understand right

4360
01:17:29,570 --> 01:17:29,580
yeah it's that really understand right
 

4361
01:17:29,580 --> 01:17:31,610
yeah it's that really understand right
and not be afraid of yeah

4362
01:17:31,610 --> 01:17:31,620
and not be afraid of yeah
 

4363
01:17:31,620 --> 01:17:33,709
and not be afraid of yeah
like we mentioned at the beginning uh

4364
01:17:33,709 --> 01:17:33,719
like we mentioned at the beginning uh
 

4365
01:17:33,719 --> 01:17:35,810
like we mentioned at the beginning uh

4375
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:49,189
IBM D blue versus Kasparov chess match
in 96 and 97. uh just just to ask kind

4376
01:17:49,189 --> 01:17:49,199
in 96 and 97. uh just just to ask kind
 

4377
01:17:49,199 --> 01:17:50,990
in 96 and 97. uh just just to ask kind
of like what your perception is what

4378
01:17:50,990 --> 01:17:51,000
of like what your perception is what
 

4379
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,209
of like what your perception is what
your memory is of it what is what is

4380
01:17:53,209 --> 01:17:53,219
your memory is of it what is what is
 

4381
01:17:53,219 --> 01:17:55,550
your memory is of it what is what is
that Moment Like This seminal moment I

4382
01:17:55,550 --> 01:17:55,560
that Moment Like This seminal moment I
 

4383
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:56,750
that Moment Like This seminal moment I
believe probably one of the greatest

4384
01:17:56,750 --> 01:17:56,760
believe probably one of the greatest
 

4385
01:17:56,760 --> 01:17:58,550
believe probably one of the greatest
moments in AI history when the machine

4386
01:17:58,550 --> 01:17:58,560
moments in AI history when the machine
 

4387
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:01,790
moments in AI history when the machine
first beat a human at a thing that

4388
01:18:01,790 --> 01:18:01,800
first beat a human at a thing that
 

4389
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:04,550
first beat a human at a thing that
humans you make a very interesting point

4390
01:18:04,550 --> 01:18:04,560
humans you make a very interesting point
 

4391
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:05,990
humans you make a very interesting point
because it is like one of the first

4392
01:18:05,990 --> 01:18:06,000
because it is like one of the first
 

4393
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,090
because it is like one of the first
demonstrations of using a game to like

4394
01:18:08,090 --> 01:18:08,100
demonstrations of using a game to like
 

4395
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:09,290
demonstrations of using a game to like
bring something to people's

4396
01:18:09,290 --> 01:18:09,300
bring something to people's
 

4397
01:18:09,300 --> 01:18:11,149
bring something to people's
Consciousness right and into this date

4398
01:18:11,149 --> 01:18:11,159
Consciousness right and into this date
 

4399
01:18:11,159 --> 01:18:13,189
Consciousness right and into this date
people use games right to demonstrate

4400
01:18:13,189 --> 01:18:13,199
people use games right to demonstrate
 

4401
01:18:13,199 --> 01:18:14,990
people use games right to demonstrate
different things

4402
01:18:14,990 --> 01:18:15,000
different things
 

4403
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,570
different things
um but at the time

4404
01:18:17,570 --> 01:18:17,580
um but at the time
 

4405
01:18:17,580 --> 01:18:19,790
um but at the time
funny and didn't necessarily think of it

4406
01:18:19,790 --> 01:18:19,800
funny and didn't necessarily think of it
 

4407
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:22,189
funny and didn't necessarily think of it
so much as Ai and I'll tell you why I

4408
01:18:22,189 --> 01:18:22,199
so much as Ai and I'll tell you why I
 

4409
01:18:22,199 --> 01:18:23,750
so much as Ai and I'll tell you why I
was and I'm not a chess player you might

4410
01:18:23,750 --> 01:18:23,760
was and I'm not a chess player you might
 

4411
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:25,430
was and I'm not a chess player you might
be a chess player so I'm not expert at

4412
01:18:25,430 --> 01:18:25,440
be a chess player so I'm not expert at
 

4413
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:27,830
be a chess player so I'm not expert at
it but I think I understand properly of

4414
01:18:27,830 --> 01:18:27,840
it but I think I understand properly of
 

4415
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:29,930
it but I think I understand properly of
Chess that chess has got a finite number

4416
01:18:29,930 --> 01:18:29,940
Chess that chess has got a finite number
 

4417
01:18:29,940 --> 01:18:32,330
Chess that chess has got a finite number
of moves that can be made therefore if

4418
01:18:32,330 --> 01:18:32,340
of moves that can be made therefore if
 

4419
01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:34,370
of moves that can be made therefore if
it's finite really what's a

4420
01:18:34,370 --> 01:18:34,380
it's finite really what's a
 

4421
01:18:34,380 --> 01:18:35,930
it's finite really what's a
demonstration of a super Computing right

4422
01:18:35,930 --> 01:18:35,940
demonstration of a super Computing right
 

4423
01:18:35,940 --> 01:18:37,370
demonstration of a super Computing right
it's about the amount of time and how

4424
01:18:37,370 --> 01:18:37,380
it's about the amount of time and how
 

4425
01:18:37,380 --> 01:18:39,050
it's about the amount of time and how
fast it can crunch through to find the

4426
01:18:39,050 --> 01:18:39,060
fast it can crunch through to find the
 

4427
01:18:39,060 --> 01:18:41,630
fast it can crunch through to find the
right move so in some ways I thought of

4428
01:18:41,630 --> 01:18:41,640
right move so in some ways I thought of
 

4429
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:43,490
right move so in some ways I thought of
it as almost a bigger demonstration of

4430
01:18:43,490 --> 01:18:43,500
it as almost a bigger demonstration of
 

4431
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:46,189
it as almost a bigger demonstration of
that but it is absolutely as you said it

4432
01:18:46,189 --> 01:18:46,199
that but it is absolutely as you said it
 

4433
01:18:46,199 --> 01:18:48,290
that but it is absolutely as you said it
it is was a motivator one of the big

4434
01:18:48,290 --> 01:18:48,300
it is was a motivator one of the big
 

4435
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:50,209
it is was a motivator one of the big
Milestones of AI because it put in your

4436
01:18:50,209 --> 01:18:50,219
Milestones of AI because it put in your
 

4437
01:18:50,219 --> 01:18:51,830
Milestones of AI because it put in your
Consciousness that it's man

4438
01:18:51,830 --> 01:18:51,840
Consciousness that it's man
 

4439
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:54,229
Consciousness that it's man
in this per in this other machine right

4440
01:18:54,229 --> 01:18:54,239
in this per in this other machine right
 

4441
01:18:54,239 --> 01:18:56,330
in this per in this other machine right
yeah I'm doing something so you saw it

4442
01:18:56,330 --> 01:18:56,340
yeah I'm doing something so you saw it
 

4443
01:18:56,340 --> 01:18:57,470
yeah I'm doing something so you saw it
as just a challenging competition

4444
01:18:57,470 --> 01:18:57,480
as just a challenging competition
 

4445
01:18:57,480 --> 01:18:59,870
as just a challenging competition
problem and this is a way to demonstrate

4446
01:18:59,870 --> 01:18:59,880
problem and this is a way to demonstrate
 

4447
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:01,790
problem and this is a way to demonstrate
hardware and software computation at its

4448
01:19:01,790 --> 01:19:01,800
hardware and software computation at its
 

4449
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:04,310
hardware and software computation at its
best yes I did but the thing is there is

4450
01:19:04,310 --> 01:19:04,320
best yes I did but the thing is there is
 

4451
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:07,669
best yes I did but the thing is there is
a romantic notion that chess is the

4452
01:19:07,669 --> 01:19:07,679
a romantic notion that chess is the
 

4453
01:19:07,679 --> 01:19:09,950
a romantic notion that chess is the
embodiment of human intellect I mean

4454
01:19:09,950 --> 01:19:09,960
embodiment of human intellect I mean
 

4455
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:12,050
embodiment of human intellect I mean
intelligence that you can't build a

4456
01:19:12,050 --> 01:19:12,060
intelligence that you can't build a
 

4457
01:19:12,060 --> 01:19:13,910
intelligence that you can't build a
machine that can beat a chess champion

4458
01:19:13,910 --> 01:19:13,920
machine that can beat a chess champion
 

4459
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:16,610
machine that can beat a chess champion
in chess and the the fact that blessed

4460
01:19:16,610 --> 01:19:16,620
in chess and the the fact that blessed
 

4461
01:19:16,620 --> 01:19:18,110
in chess and the the fact that blessed
by not being a chess expert so it wasn't

4462
01:19:18,110 --> 01:19:18,120
by not being a chess expert so it wasn't
 

4463
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:19,729
by not being a chess expert so it wasn't
like it's just a computation problem

4464
01:19:19,729 --> 01:19:19,739
like it's just a computation problem
 

4465
01:19:19,739 --> 01:19:21,770
like it's just a computation problem
it's a computation problem to me well

4466
01:19:21,770 --> 01:19:21,780
it's a computation problem to me well
 

4467
01:19:21,780 --> 01:19:25,070
it's a computation problem to me well
that's probably required to not be

4468
01:19:25,070 --> 01:19:25,080
that's probably required to not be
 

4469
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:26,930
that's probably required to not be
paralyzed by the immensity of the task

4470
01:19:26,930 --> 01:19:26,940
paralyzed by the immensity of the task
 

4471
01:19:26,940 --> 01:19:29,930
paralyzed by the immensity of the task
yeah so that this is just solvable but

4472
01:19:29,930 --> 01:19:29,940
yeah so that this is just solvable but
 

4473
01:19:29,940 --> 01:19:32,270
yeah so that this is just solvable but
it was a very very I think that was a

4474
01:19:32,270 --> 01:19:32,280
it was a very very I think that was a
 

4475
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:34,189
it was a very very I think that was a
powerful moment so speaking just as an

4476
01:19:34,189 --> 01:19:34,199
powerful moment so speaking just as an
 

4477
01:19:34,199 --> 01:19:36,430
powerful moment so speaking just as an
AI person that was uh

4478
01:19:36,430 --> 01:19:36,440
AI person that was uh
 

4479
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:38,050
AI person that was uh
that

4480
01:19:38,050 --> 01:19:38,060
that
 

4481
01:19:38,060 --> 01:19:40,250
that
reinvigorated the dream you were a

4482
01:19:40,250 --> 01:19:40,260
reinvigorated the dream you were a
 

4483
01:19:40,260 --> 01:19:41,510
reinvigorated the dream you were a
little kid back then though right at

4484
01:19:41,510 --> 01:19:41,520
little kid back then though right at
 

4485
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:43,930
little kid back then though right at
that at 95. you have to be like were you

4486
01:19:43,930 --> 01:19:43,940
that at 95. you have to be like were you
 

4487
01:19:43,940 --> 01:19:46,010
that at 95. you have to be like were you
uh you remember it actually at the

4488
01:19:46,010 --> 01:19:46,020
uh you remember it actually at the
 

4489
01:19:46,020 --> 01:19:47,149
uh you remember it actually at the
moment yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

4490
01:19:47,149 --> 01:19:47,159
moment yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
 

4491
01:19:47,159 --> 01:19:48,830
moment yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
what did you think at the moment about

4492
01:19:48,830 --> 01:19:48,840
what did you think at the moment about
 

4493
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:49,550
what did you think at the moment about
it

4494
01:19:49,550 --> 01:19:49,560
it
 

4495
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:52,130
it
uh

4496
01:19:52,130 --> 01:19:52,140
uh
 

4497
01:19:52,140 --> 01:19:54,490
uh
it was

4498
01:19:54,490 --> 01:19:54,500
it was
 

4499
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:56,689
it was
awe-inspiring because

4500
01:19:56,689 --> 01:19:56,699
awe-inspiring because
 

4501
01:19:56,699 --> 01:19:58,669
awe-inspiring because
um especially sort of growing up in the

4502
01:19:58,669 --> 01:19:58,679
um especially sort of growing up in the
 

4503
01:19:58,679 --> 01:20:00,229
um especially sort of growing up in the
Soviet Union

4504
01:20:00,229 --> 01:20:00,239
Soviet Union
 

4505
01:20:00,239 --> 01:20:02,750
Soviet Union
you think especially if Gary Kasparov

4506
01:20:02,750 --> 01:20:02,760
you think especially if Gary Kasparov
 

4507
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:05,990
you think especially if Gary Kasparov
and chess like your intuition is weak

4508
01:20:05,990 --> 01:20:06,000
and chess like your intuition is weak
 

4509
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,910
and chess like your intuition is weak
about those things I didn't see it as

4510
01:20:07,910 --> 01:20:07,920
about those things I didn't see it as
 

4511
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:10,669
about those things I didn't see it as
computation I thought of it as um

4512
01:20:10,669 --> 01:20:10,679
computation I thought of it as um
 

4513
01:20:10,679 --> 01:20:13,130
computation I thought of it as um
uh intelligence because

4514
01:20:13,130 --> 01:20:13,140
uh intelligence because
 

4515
01:20:13,140 --> 01:20:15,169
uh intelligence because
chess for a human being doesn't feel

4516
01:20:15,169 --> 01:20:15,179
chess for a human being doesn't feel
 

4517
01:20:15,179 --> 01:20:18,250
chess for a human being doesn't feel
like computation yeah it it feels like

4518
01:20:18,250 --> 01:20:18,260
like computation yeah it it feels like
 

4519
01:20:18,260 --> 01:20:21,530
like computation yeah it it feels like
some complicated uh relationship between

4520
01:20:21,530 --> 01:20:21,540
some complicated uh relationship between
 

4521
01:20:21,540 --> 01:20:25,250
some complicated uh relationship between
memory and patterns and intuition and

4522
01:20:25,250 --> 01:20:25,260
memory and patterns and intuition and
 

4523
01:20:25,260 --> 01:20:28,189
memory and patterns and intuition and
guts and Instinct and all of those like

4524
01:20:28,189 --> 01:20:28,199
guts and Instinct and all of those like
 

4525
01:20:28,199 --> 01:20:29,750
guts and Instinct and all of those like
so if you watch someone play that's what

4526
01:20:29,750 --> 01:20:29,760
so if you watch someone play that's what
 

4527
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:31,610
so if you watch someone play that's what
you have to conclude right and so to see

4528
01:20:31,610 --> 01:20:31,620
you have to conclude right and so to see
 

4529
01:20:31,620 --> 01:20:34,850
you have to conclude right and so to see
a machine be able to uh be a human I

4530
01:20:34,850 --> 01:20:34,860
a machine be able to uh be a human I
 

4531
01:20:34,860 --> 01:20:36,530
a machine be able to uh be a human I
mean you get a little bit of that with

4532
01:20:36,530 --> 01:20:36,540
mean you get a little bit of that with
 

4533
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:39,350
mean you get a little bit of that with
chagi PT now it's like language was to

4534
01:20:39,350 --> 01:20:39,360
chagi PT now it's like language was to
 

4535
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:43,189
chagi PT now it's like language was to
us humans the thing that we kind of uh

4536
01:20:43,189 --> 01:20:43,199
us humans the thing that we kind of uh
 

4537
01:20:43,199 --> 01:20:45,830

surely the The Poetry of language is

surely the The Poetry of language is
 

4539
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:47,330
surely the The Poetry of language is
something only humans can really have

4540
01:20:47,330 --> 01:20:47,340
something only humans can really have
 

4541
01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:49,790
something only humans can really have
it's going to be very difficult to

4542
01:20:49,790 --> 01:20:49,800
it's going to be very difficult to
 

4543
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:52,669
it's going to be very difficult to
replicate the magic of a natural

exhibit human-like emotions and feelings
 

4603
01:21:59,219 --> 01:22:01,370
exhibit human-like emotions and feelings
and you have to start to have some

4604
01:22:01,370 --> 01:22:01,380
and you have to start to have some
 

4605
01:22:01,380 --> 01:22:04,010
and you have to start to have some
difficult discussions about well how do

4606
01:22:04,010 --> 01:22:04,020
difficult discussions about well how do
 

4607
01:22:04,020 --> 01:22:06,709

we treat those beings and what role do

4608
01:22:06,709 --> 01:22:06,719
we treat those beings and what role do
 

4609
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:08,209
we treat those beings and what role do
they have in society what are the rules

4610
01:22:08,209 --> 01:22:08,219
they have in society what are the rules
 

4611
01:22:08,219 --> 01:22:10,310
they have in society what are the rules
around that you know and this is really

4612
01:22:10,310 --> 01:22:10,320
around that you know and this is really
 

4613
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:12,110
around that you know and this is really
exciting because that also puts a mirror

4614
01:22:12,110 --> 01:22:12,120
exciting because that also puts a mirror
 

4615
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:14,570
exciting because that also puts a mirror
to ourselves to see okay what's the

4616
01:22:14,570 --> 01:22:14,580
to ourselves to see okay what's the
 

4617
01:22:14,580 --> 01:22:15,410
to ourselves to see okay what's the
right

4618
01:22:15,410 --> 01:22:15,420
right
 

4619
01:22:15,420 --> 01:22:17,270
right
way to to treat each other as human

4620
01:22:17,270 --> 01:22:17,280
way to to treat each other as human
 

4621
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:19,070
way to to treat each other as human
beings because it's a it's a good test

4622
01:22:19,070 --> 01:22:19,080
beings because it's a it's a good test
 

4623
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:21,709
beings because it's a it's a good test
for that it is because I always say it's

4624
01:22:21,709 --> 01:22:21,719
for that it is because I always say it's
 

4625
01:22:21,719 --> 01:22:24,709
for that it is because I always say it's
a um a reflection of humanity what a I

4626
01:22:24,709 --> 01:22:24,719
a um a reflection of humanity what a I
 

4627
01:22:24,719 --> 01:22:26,149
a um a reflection of humanity what a I
mean it's taught by what man you know

4628
01:22:26,149 --> 01:22:26,159
mean it's taught by what man you know
 

4629
01:22:26,159 --> 01:22:27,590
mean it's taught by what man you know
for bad stuff in the past you'll teach

4630
01:22:27,590 --> 01:22:27,600
for bad stuff in the past you'll teach
 

4631
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:29,810
for bad stuff in the past you'll teach
it bad stuff for the future and which is

4632
01:22:29,810 --> 01:22:29,820
it bad stuff for the future and which is
 

4633
01:22:29,820 --> 01:22:31,970
it bad stuff for the future and which is
why I think you know like efforts to

4634
01:22:31,970 --> 01:22:31,980
why I think you know like efforts to
 

4635
01:22:31,980 --> 01:22:34,130
why I think you know like efforts to
regulate it are a Fool's ear and you

4636
01:22:34,130 --> 01:22:34,140
regulate it are a Fool's ear and you
 

4637
01:22:34,140 --> 01:22:36,410
regulate it are a Fool's ear and you
need to regulate uses not you know

4638
01:22:36,410 --> 01:22:36,420
need to regulate uses not you know
 

4639
01:22:36,420 --> 01:22:37,729
need to regulate uses not you know
because it's not the technology itself

4640
01:22:37,729 --> 01:22:37,739
because it's not the technology itself
 

4641
01:22:37,739 --> 01:22:40,010
because it's not the technology itself
is not inherently good or bad but how

4642
01:22:40,010 --> 01:22:40,020
is not inherently good or bad but how
 

4643
01:22:40,020 --> 01:22:42,350
is not inherently good or bad but how
it's used or taught can be good or bad

4644
01:22:42,350 --> 01:22:42,360
it's used or taught can be good or bad
 

4645
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:45,830
it's used or taught can be good or bad
for sure right and so um that's to me

4646
01:22:45,830 --> 01:22:45,840
for sure right and so um that's to me
 

4647
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:47,990
for sure right and so um that's to me
will unveil now a whole different way of

4648
01:22:47,990 --> 01:22:48,000
will unveil now a whole different way of
 

4649
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,390
will unveil now a whole different way of
having to look at technology uh what

4650
01:22:50,390 --> 01:22:50,400
having to look at technology uh what
 

4651
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:52,370
having to look at technology uh what
about another magical leap with the

4652
01:22:52,370 --> 01:22:52,380
about another magical leap with the
 

4653
01:22:52,380 --> 01:22:53,689
about another magical leap with the
early days of Watson with beating the

4654
01:22:53,689 --> 01:22:53,699
early days of Watson with beating the
 

4655
01:22:53,699 --> 01:22:55,310
early days of Watson with beating the
Jeopardy challenge what was your

4656
01:22:55,310 --> 01:22:55,320
Jeopardy challenge what was your
 

4657
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:56,810
Jeopardy challenge what was your
experience like with Watson what's your

4658
01:22:56,810 --> 01:22:56,820
experience like with Watson what's your
 

4659
01:22:56,820 --> 01:22:59,270
experience like with Watson what's your
vision for Watson in general yeah and it

4660
01:22:59,270 --> 01:22:59,280
vision for Watson in general yeah and it
 

4661
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:01,370
vision for Watson in general yeah and it
was really inspired by first chess right

4662
01:23:01,370 --> 01:23:01,380
was really inspired by first chess right
 

4663
01:23:01,380 --> 01:23:03,110
was really inspired by first chess right
and Casper off and then you come forward

4664
01:23:03,110 --> 01:23:03,120
and Casper off and then you come forward
 

4665
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:06,649
and Casper off and then you come forward
in time and you know I think what Watson

4666
01:23:06,649 --> 01:23:06,659
in time and you know I think what Watson
 

4667
01:23:06,659 --> 01:23:09,169
in time and you know I think what Watson
did because you used a really important

4668
01:23:09,169 --> 01:23:09,179
did because you used a really important
 

4669
01:23:09,179 --> 01:23:11,810
did because you used a really important
word AI had kind of waxed and waned in

4670
01:23:11,810 --> 01:23:11,820
word AI had kind of waxed and waned in
 

4671
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:13,910
word AI had kind of waxed and waned in
these winners right in and out in and

4672
01:23:13,910 --> 01:23:13,920
these winners right in and out in and
 

4673
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:16,490
these winners right in and out in and
out popular not more money less money

4674
01:23:16,490 --> 01:23:16,500
out popular not more money less money
 

4675
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:18,229
out popular not more money less money
you know in and out confidence no

4676
01:23:18,229 --> 01:23:18,239
you know in and out confidence no
 

4677
01:23:18,239 --> 01:23:20,930
you know in and out confidence no
confidence and so I think that was one

4678
01:23:20,930 --> 01:23:20,940
confidence and so I think that was one
 

4679
01:23:20,940 --> 01:23:22,430
confidence and so I think that was one
of the first times it brought to the

4680
01:23:22,430 --> 01:23:22,440
of the first times it brought to the
 

4681
01:23:22,440 --> 01:23:25,550
of the first times it brought to the
Forefront of people like oh I could

4682
01:23:25,550 --> 01:23:25,560
Forefront of people like oh I could
 

4683
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:27,590
Forefront of people like oh I could
humanized it because here it is playing

4684
01:23:27,590 --> 01:23:27,600
humanized it because here it is playing
 

4685
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:30,950
humanized it because here it is playing
against these two gentlemen and as you

4686
01:23:30,950 --> 01:23:30,960
against these two gentlemen and as you
 

4687
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:32,570
against these two gentlemen and as you
did lose it first you know and then

4688
01:23:32,570 --> 01:23:32,580
did lose it first you know and then
 

4689
01:23:32,580 --> 01:23:34,490
did lose it first you know and then
finally finally one at the end of the

4690
01:23:34,490 --> 01:23:34,500
finally finally one at the end of the
 

4691
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:37,130
finally finally one at the end of the
day and but what it was doing is making

4692
01:23:37,130 --> 01:23:37,140
day and but what it was doing is making
 

4693
01:23:37,140 --> 01:23:39,530
day and but what it was doing is making
you say hey natural language it's

4694
01:23:39,530 --> 01:23:39,540
you say hey natural language it's
 

4695
01:23:39,540 --> 01:23:40,850
you say hey natural language it's
actually understanding natural language

4696
01:23:40,850 --> 01:23:40,860
actually understanding natural language
 

4697
01:23:40,860 --> 01:23:42,350
actually understanding natural language
it's one of the first demonstrations of

4698
01:23:42,350 --> 01:23:42,360
it's one of the first demonstrations of
 

4699
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:44,810
it's one of the first demonstrations of
natural language support and bit of

4700
01:23:44,810 --> 01:23:44,820
natural language support and bit of
 

4701
01:23:44,820 --> 01:23:48,110
natural language support and bit of
reasoning over lots of data right and so

4702
01:23:48,110 --> 01:23:48,120
reasoning over lots of data right and so
 

4703
01:23:48,120 --> 01:23:50,330
reasoning over lots of data right and so
that it could have access to a lot of

4704
01:23:50,330 --> 01:23:50,340
that it could have access to a lot of
 

4705
01:23:50,340 --> 01:23:52,070
that it could have access to a lot of
things come up with a conclusion on it

4706
01:23:52,070 --> 01:23:52,080
things come up with a conclusion on it
 

4707
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:55,010
things come up with a conclusion on it
and to me that was a a really big moment

4708
01:23:55,010 --> 01:23:55,020
and to me that was a a really big moment
 

4709
01:23:55,020 --> 01:23:56,390
and to me that was a a really big moment
and I do think it brought to the

4710
01:23:56,390 --> 01:23:56,400
and I do think it brought to the
 

4711
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:58,430
and I do think it brought to the
conscious of the public and in good ways

4712
01:23:58,430 --> 01:23:58,440
conscious of the public and in good ways
 

4713
01:23:58,440 --> 01:23:59,209
conscious of the public and in good ways
and bad because it probably set

4714
01:23:59,209 --> 01:23:59,219
and bad because it probably set
 

4715
01:23:59,219 --> 01:24:01,790
and bad because it probably set
expectations very high of like whoa what

4716
01:24:01,790 --> 01:24:01,800
expectations very high of like whoa what
 

4717
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:04,430
expectations very high of like whoa what
this could be but and I still do believe

4718
01:24:04,430 --> 01:24:04,440
this could be but and I still do believe
 

4719
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:08,450
this could be but and I still do believe
that it has got the ability to change

4720
01:24:08,450 --> 01:24:08,460
that it has got the ability to change
 

4721
01:24:08,460 --> 01:24:11,630
that it has got the ability to change
and help us man make better decisions

4722
01:24:11,630 --> 01:24:11,640
and help us man make better decisions
 

4723
01:24:11,640 --> 01:24:13,850
and help us man make better decisions
that so many decisions are not optimal

4724
01:24:13,850 --> 01:24:13,860
that so many decisions are not optimal
 

4725
01:24:13,860 --> 01:24:15,709
that so many decisions are not optimal
in this world you know even medical

4726
01:24:15,709 --> 01:24:15,719
in this world you know even medical
 

4727
01:24:15,719 --> 01:24:17,870
in this world you know even medical
decisions and it's right or wrong what

4728
01:24:17,870 --> 01:24:17,880
decisions and it's right or wrong what
 

4729
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:20,090
decisions and it's right or wrong what
took us down a path of Health Care First

4730
01:24:20,090 --> 01:24:20,100
took us down a path of Health Care First
 

4731
01:24:20,100 --> 01:24:23,090
took us down a path of Health Care First
with our Ai and and we took many pivots

4732
01:24:23,090 --> 01:24:23,100
with our Ai and and we took many pivots
 

4733
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:24,590
with our Ai and and we took many pivots
and I think there's a really valuable

4734
01:24:24,590 --> 01:24:24,600
and I think there's a really valuable
 

4735
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:27,169
and I think there's a really valuable
lesson in what we learned one is that

4736
01:24:27,169 --> 01:24:27,179
lesson in what we learned one is that
 

4737
01:24:27,179 --> 01:24:28,729
lesson in what we learned one is that
actually I don't think the challenges

4738
01:24:28,729 --> 01:24:28,739
actually I don't think the challenges
 

4739
01:24:28,739 --> 01:24:30,470
actually I don't think the challenges
are the technology yes those are

4740
01:24:30,470 --> 01:24:30,480
are the technology yes those are
 

4741
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:32,390
are the technology yes those are
challenges but the challenges are the

4742
01:24:32,390 --> 01:24:32,400
challenges but the challenges are the
 

4743
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:33,410
challenges but the challenges are the
people taking out are the people

4744
01:24:33,410 --> 01:24:33,420
people taking out are the people
 

4745
01:24:33,420 --> 01:24:35,750
people taking out are the people
challenges around this right so do

4746
01:24:35,750 --> 01:24:35,760
challenges around this right so do
 

4747
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:37,070
challenges around this right so do
people trust it

4748
01:24:37,070 --> 01:24:37,080
people trust it
 

4749
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:41,330
people trust it
how will they use it I mean I saw that

4750
01:24:41,330 --> 01:24:41,340
how will they use it I mean I saw that
 

4751
01:24:41,340 --> 01:24:43,729
how will they use it I mean I saw that
straight up with with doctors and like

4752
01:24:43,729 --> 01:24:43,739
straight up with with doctors and like
 

4753
01:24:43,739 --> 01:24:45,830
straight up with with doctors and like
meaning they're so busy in the way

4754
01:24:45,830 --> 01:24:45,840
meaning they're so busy in the way
 

4755
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:47,930
meaning they're so busy in the way
they've been taught to do something

4756
01:24:47,930 --> 01:24:47,940
they've been taught to do something
 

4757
01:24:47,940 --> 01:24:49,189
they've been taught to do something
do they really have time to learn

4758
01:24:49,189 --> 01:24:49,199
do they really have time to learn
 

4759
01:24:49,199 --> 01:24:51,229
do they really have time to learn
another way I saw it was a mistake when

4760
01:24:51,229 --> 01:24:51,239
another way I saw it was a mistake when
 

4761
01:24:51,239 --> 01:24:52,970
another way I saw it was a mistake when
you put it on top of processes it didn't

4762
01:24:52,970 --> 01:24:52,980
you put it on top of processes it didn't
 

4763
01:24:52,980 --> 01:24:55,070
you put it on top of processes it didn't
change kind of like Paving a cow path

4764
01:24:55,070 --> 01:24:55,080
change kind of like Paving a cow path
 

4765
01:24:55,080 --> 01:24:57,950
change kind of like Paving a cow path
didn't work I mean it was all human

4766
01:24:57,950 --> 01:24:57,960
didn't work I mean it was all human
 

4767
01:24:57,960 --> 01:25:00,050
didn't work I mean it was all human
change management around it that were

4768
01:25:00,050 --> 01:25:00,060
change management around it that were
 

4769
01:25:00,060 --> 01:25:02,630
change management around it that were
really its biggest challenges and

4770
01:25:02,630 --> 01:25:02,640
really its biggest challenges and
 

4771
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:04,430
really its biggest challenges and
another valuable lesson we picked back

4772
01:25:04,430 --> 01:25:04,440
another valuable lesson we picked back
 

4773
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:05,689
another valuable lesson we picked back
to you said you think of IBM as

4774
01:25:05,689 --> 01:25:05,699
to you said you think of IBM as
 

4775
01:25:05,699 --> 01:25:08,149
to you said you think of IBM as
moonshops we picked really hard problems

4776
01:25:08,149 --> 01:25:08,159
moonshops we picked really hard problems
 

4777
01:25:08,159 --> 01:25:10,370
moonshops we picked really hard problems
to start with I think you see a lot of

4778
01:25:10,370 --> 01:25:10,380
to start with I think you see a lot of
 

4779
01:25:10,380 --> 01:25:12,050
to start with I think you see a lot of
Technology now starts with really simple

4780
01:25:12,050 --> 01:25:12,060
Technology now starts with really simple
 

4781
01:25:12,060 --> 01:25:15,590
Technology now starts with really simple
problems and and by that it probably

4782
01:25:15,590 --> 01:25:15,600
problems and and by that it probably
 

4783
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:17,149
problems and and by that it probably
starts to build trust because I start

4784
01:25:17,149 --> 01:25:17,159
starts to build trust because I start
 

4785
01:25:17,159 --> 01:25:19,189
starts to build trust because I start
little it's like oh I'm not ready to you

4786
01:25:19,189 --> 01:25:19,199
little it's like oh I'm not ready to you
 

4787
01:25:19,199 --> 01:25:20,870
little it's like oh I'm not ready to you
know Outsource my diagnosis to you but

4788
01:25:20,870 --> 01:25:20,880
know Outsource my diagnosis to you but
 

4789
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:22,490
know Outsource my diagnosis to you but
I'll get some information here about a

4790
01:25:22,490 --> 01:25:22,500
I'll get some information here about a
 

4791
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:25,010
I'll get some information here about a
test question so very different thinking

4792
01:25:25,010 --> 01:25:25,020
test question so very different thinking
 

4793
01:25:25,020 --> 01:25:27,050
test question so very different thinking
so a lot of things to learn we were

4794
01:25:27,050 --> 01:25:27,060
so a lot of things to learn we were
 

4795
01:25:27,060 --> 01:25:29,390
so a lot of things to learn we were
making a market at the time and when you

4796
01:25:29,390 --> 01:25:29,400
making a market at the time and when you
 

4797
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:31,790
making a market at the time and when you
make a market you know choice of problem

4798
01:25:31,790 --> 01:25:31,800
make a market you know choice of problem
 

4799
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:33,649
make a market you know choice of problem
you work on gets to be very important

4800
01:25:33,649 --> 01:25:33,659
you work on gets to be very important
 

4801
01:25:33,659 --> 01:25:35,570
you work on gets to be very important
when you're catching up well then it's a

4802
01:25:35,570 --> 01:25:35,580
when you're catching up well then it's a
 

4803
01:25:35,580 --> 01:25:37,910
when you're catching up well then it's a
scale game so very different thing and

4804
01:25:37,910 --> 01:25:37,920
scale game so very different thing and
 

4805
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:41,450
scale game so very different thing and
so but Watson proved I think I mean I

4806
01:25:41,450 --> 01:25:41,460
so but Watson proved I think I mean I
 

4807
01:25:41,460 --> 01:25:43,370
so but Watson proved I think I mean I
hope I'm not being too

4808
01:25:43,370 --> 01:25:43,380
hope I'm not being too
 

4809
01:25:43,380 --> 01:25:44,270
hope I'm not being too
um

4810
01:25:44,270 --> 01:25:44,280
um
 

4811
01:25:44,280 --> 01:25:46,790
um
I think Watson brought AI back out a

4812
01:25:46,790 --> 01:25:46,800
I think Watson brought AI back out a
 

4813
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:48,830
I think Watson brought AI back out a
winner for the world and that since then

4814
01:25:48,830 --> 01:25:48,840
winner for the world and that since then
 

4815
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:50,030
winner for the world and that since then
there's just been you know one company

4816
01:25:50,030 --> 01:25:50,040
there's just been you know one company
 

4817
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:51,590
there's just been you know one company
after another in Innovations and people

4818
01:25:51,590 --> 01:25:51,600
after another in Innovations and people
 

4819
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:54,890
after another in Innovations and people
working on it and I have no regrets of

4820
01:25:54,890 --> 01:25:54,900
working on it and I have no regrets of
 

4821
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:56,450
working on it and I have no regrets of
anything that we did we learned so much

4822
01:25:56,450 --> 01:25:56,460
anything that we did we learned so much
 

4823
01:25:56,460 --> 01:25:58,490
anything that we did we learned so much
and we probably rebuilt it many times

4824
01:25:58,490 --> 01:25:58,500
and we probably rebuilt it many times
 

4825
01:25:58,500 --> 01:26:00,830
and we probably rebuilt it many times
over it made it more modular

4826
01:26:00,830 --> 01:26:00,840
over it made it more modular
 

4827
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:04,610
over it made it more modular
and today tybm a Watson is more about AI

4828
01:26:04,610 --> 01:26:04,620
and today tybm a Watson is more about AI
 

4829
01:26:04,620 --> 01:26:06,590
and today tybm a Watson is more about AI
inside of a lot of things if you think

4830
01:26:06,590 --> 01:26:06,600
inside of a lot of things if you think
 

4831
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:08,450
inside of a lot of things if you think
of it that way which is more like an

4832
01:26:08,450 --> 01:26:08,460
of it that way which is more like an
 

4833
01:26:08,460 --> 01:26:10,490
of it that way which is more like an
ingredient versus it's a thing in and of

4834
01:26:10,490 --> 01:26:10,500
ingredient versus it's a thing in and of
 

4835
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:11,750
ingredient versus it's a thing in and of
itself and I think that's how it'll

4836
01:26:11,750 --> 01:26:11,760
itself and I think that's how it'll
 

4837
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:13,310
itself and I think that's how it'll
bring it to real value you know more as

4838
01:26:13,310 --> 01:26:13,320
bring it to real value you know more as
 

4839
01:26:13,320 --> 01:26:15,410
bring it to real value you know more as
an ingredient and it's so badly needed

4840
01:26:15,410 --> 01:26:15,420
an ingredient and it's so badly needed
 

4841
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:17,870
an ingredient and it's so badly needed
and even back then the issue was so much

4842
01:26:17,870 --> 01:26:17,880
and even back then the issue was so much
 

4843
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:19,610
and even back then the issue was so much
data like what do you ever do it you

4844
01:26:19,610 --> 01:26:19,620
data like what do you ever do it you
 

4845
01:26:19,620 --> 01:26:20,810
data like what do you ever do it you
can't get through it you can't use it

4846
01:26:20,810 --> 01:26:20,820
can't get through it you can't use it
 

4847
01:26:20,820 --> 01:26:21,950
can't get through it you can't use it
for anything you know this well it's

4848
01:26:21,950 --> 01:26:21,960
for anything you know this well it's
 

4849
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:24,169
for anything you know this well it's
your profession so

4850
01:26:24,169 --> 01:26:24,179
your profession so
 

4851
01:26:24,179 --> 01:26:24,890
your profession so
um

4852
01:26:24,890 --> 01:26:24,900
um
 

4853
01:26:24,900 --> 01:26:27,229
um
we have to have it so that's a that's

4854
01:26:27,229 --> 01:26:27,239
we have to have it so that's a that's
 

4855
01:26:27,239 --> 01:26:28,850
we have to have it so that's a that's
going to propel it forward so it's part

4856
01:26:28,850 --> 01:26:28,860
going to propel it forward so it's part
 

4857
01:26:28,860 --> 01:26:31,310
going to propel it forward so it's part
of The Suite of tools that you you use

4858
01:26:31,310 --> 01:26:31,320
of The Suite of tools that you you use
 

4859
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:33,110
of The Suite of tools that you you use
when you go to Enterprise and you try to

4860
01:26:33,110 --> 01:26:33,120
when you go to Enterprise and you try to
 

4861
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:36,050
when you go to Enterprise and you try to
solve yeah problems AI for security Ai

4862
01:26:36,050 --> 01:26:36,060
solve yeah problems AI for security Ai
 

4863
01:26:36,060 --> 01:26:38,030
solve yeah problems AI for security Ai
and automated operations AI in your

4864
01:26:38,030 --> 01:26:38,040
and automated operations AI in your
 

4865
01:26:38,040 --> 01:26:40,189
and automated operations AI in your
robotics AI on your factory you know I

4866
01:26:40,189 --> 01:26:40,199
robotics AI on your factory you know I
 

4867
01:26:40,199 --> 01:26:42,470
robotics AI on your factory you know I
mean it's it's all part of and I think

4868
01:26:42,470 --> 01:26:42,480
mean it's it's all part of and I think
 

4869
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:44,510
mean it's it's all part of and I think
and that's why even to this day

4870
01:26:44,510 --> 01:26:44,520
and that's why even to this day
 

4871
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:46,430
and that's why even to this day
thousands I mean thousands and thousands

4872
01:26:46,430 --> 01:26:46,440
thousands I mean thousands and thousands
 

4873
01:26:46,440 --> 01:26:48,590
thousands I mean thousands and thousands
of clients of IBM still have the Watson

4874
01:26:48,590 --> 01:26:48,600
of clients of IBM still have the Watson
 

4875
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:50,510
of clients of IBM still have the Watson
components that it's the AI being used

4876
01:26:50,510 --> 01:26:50,520
components that it's the AI being used
 

4877
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:52,669
components that it's the AI being used
so it became a platform is how I would

4878
01:26:52,669 --> 01:26:52,679
so it became a platform is how I would
 

4879
01:26:52,679 --> 01:26:54,169
so it became a platform is how I would
say it right

4880
01:26:54,169 --> 01:26:54,179
say it right
 

4881
01:26:54,179 --> 01:26:57,470
say it right
um and an ingredient and that went

4882
01:26:57,470 --> 01:26:57,480
um and an ingredient and that went
 

4883
01:26:57,480 --> 01:26:59,390
um and an ingredient and that went
inside and Consultants like you said had

4884
01:26:59,390 --> 01:26:59,400
inside and Consultants like you said had
 

4885
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:00,470
inside and Consultants like you said had
to learn

4886
01:27:00,470 --> 01:27:00,480
to learn
 

4887
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:03,050
to learn
I had they had to learn

4888
01:27:03,050 --> 01:27:03,060
I had they had to learn
 

4889
01:27:03,060 --> 01:27:05,149
I had they had to learn
don't just put it on something you got

4890
01:27:05,149 --> 01:27:05,159
don't just put it on something you got
 

4891
01:27:05,159 --> 01:27:07,010
don't just put it on something you got
to rethink how that thing should work

4892
01:27:07,010 --> 01:27:07,020
to rethink how that thing should work
 

4893
01:27:07,020 --> 01:27:08,570
to rethink how that thing should work
because with the AI it could work

4894
01:27:08,570 --> 01:27:08,580
because with the AI it could work
 

4895
01:27:08,580 --> 01:27:11,810
because with the AI it could work
entirely differently and so I also felt

4896
01:27:11,810 --> 01:27:11,820
entirely differently and so I also felt
 

4897
01:27:11,820 --> 01:27:13,610
entirely differently and so I also felt
it could open up and still will open up

4898
01:27:13,610 --> 01:27:13,620
it could open up and still will open up
 

4899
01:27:13,620 --> 01:27:16,370
it could open up and still will open up
jobs to a lot of people because more

4900
01:27:16,370 --> 01:27:16,380
jobs to a lot of people because more
 

4901
01:27:16,380 --> 01:27:17,930
jobs to a lot of people because more
like an assistant and it could help me

4902
01:27:17,930 --> 01:27:17,940
like an assistant and it could help me
 

4903
01:27:17,940 --> 01:27:19,970
like an assistant and it could help me
be qualified to do something and we we

4904
01:27:19,970 --> 01:27:19,980
be qualified to do something and we we
 

4905
01:27:19,980 --> 01:27:21,890
be qualified to do something and we we
even years ago saw this with the French

4906
01:27:21,890 --> 01:27:21,900
even years ago saw this with the French
 

4907
01:27:21,900 --> 01:27:24,770
even years ago saw this with the French
banks very unionized but that idea that

4908
01:27:24,770 --> 01:27:24,780
banks very unionized but that idea that
 

4909
01:27:24,780 --> 01:27:26,030
banks very unionized but that idea that
you could

4910
01:27:26,030 --> 01:27:26,040
you could
 

4911
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:28,129
you could
in this case the unions voted for it

4912
01:27:28,129 --> 01:27:28,139
in this case the unions voted for it
 

4913
01:27:28,139 --> 01:27:29,629
in this case the unions voted for it
because it felt people did a better job

4914
01:27:29,629 --> 01:27:29,639
because it felt people did a better job
 

4915
01:27:29,639 --> 01:27:31,129
because it felt people did a better job
and so

4916
01:27:31,129 --> 01:27:31,139
and so
 

4917
01:27:31,139 --> 01:27:32,810
and so
and that's this part about being really

4918
01:27:32,810 --> 01:27:32,820
and that's this part about being really
 

4919
01:27:32,820 --> 01:27:34,790
and that's this part about being really
dedicated to help it help Humanity not

4920
01:27:34,790 --> 01:27:34,800
dedicated to help it help Humanity not
 

4921
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:37,729
dedicated to help it help Humanity not
destroy it speaking of which a funny

4922
01:27:37,729 --> 01:27:37,739
destroy it speaking of which a funny
 

4923
01:27:37,739 --> 01:27:41,570
destroy it speaking of which a funny

thousand dollar Space Odyssey uh what do

4926
01:27:43,850 --> 01:27:43,860
thousand dollar Space Odyssey uh what do
 

4927
01:27:43,860 --> 01:27:45,530
thousand dollar Space Odyssey uh what do
you think about you know the fact that

4928
01:27:45,530 --> 01:27:45,540
you think about you know the fact that
 

4929
01:27:45,540 --> 01:27:49,370
you think about you know the fact that
HAL 9000 was named after IBM I really

4930
01:27:49,370 --> 01:27:49,380
HAL 9000 was named after IBM I really
 

4931
01:27:49,380 --> 01:27:51,530
HAL 9000 was named after IBM I really
don't think it was I know there's I

4932
01:27:51,530 --> 01:27:51,540
don't think it was I know there's I
 

4933
01:27:51,540 --> 01:27:52,910
don't think it was I know there's I
really don't I thought it could be more

4934
01:27:52,910 --> 01:27:52,920
really don't I thought it could be more
 

4935
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:54,890
really don't I thought it could be more
fake news it's more fake news I have

4936
01:27:54,890 --> 01:27:54,900
fake news it's more fake news I have
 

4937
01:27:54,900 --> 01:27:56,750
fake news it's more fake news I have
done I've like researched this tried to

4938
01:27:56,750 --> 01:27:56,760
done I've like researched this tried to
 

4939
01:27:56,760 --> 01:27:58,370
done I've like researched this tried to
find any evidence and people have talked

4940
01:27:58,370 --> 01:27:58,380
find any evidence and people have talked
 

4941
01:27:58,380 --> 01:27:59,750
find any evidence and people have talked
to you know was it really you know one

4942
01:27:59,750 --> 01:27:59,760
to you know was it really you know one
 

4943
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:01,550
to you know was it really you know one
letter it was one letter one letter also

4944
01:28:01,550 --> 01:28:01,560
letter it was one letter one letter also
 

4945
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:03,649
letter it was one letter one letter also
right people don't know H is one letter

4946
01:28:03,649 --> 01:28:03,659
right people don't know H is one letter
 

4947
01:28:03,659 --> 01:28:06,709
right people don't know H is one letter
off of I a is one letter for Alpha B and

4948
01:28:06,709 --> 01:28:06,719
off of I a is one letter for Alpha B and
 

4949
01:28:06,719 --> 01:28:08,510
off of I a is one letter for Alpha B and
then L is one better off of that was the

4950
01:28:08,510 --> 01:28:08,520
then L is one better off of that was the
 

4951
01:28:08,520 --> 01:28:10,250
then L is one better off of that was the
I think that's a solution found

4952
01:28:10,250 --> 01:28:10,260
I think that's a solution found
 

4953
01:28:10,260 --> 01:28:12,950
I think that's a solution found
afterwards you know but here's what I

4954
01:28:12,950 --> 01:28:12,960
afterwards you know but here's what I
 

4955
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:15,110
afterwards you know but here's what I
think it more was I do think it's one of

4956
01:28:15,110 --> 01:28:15,120
think it more was I do think it's one of
 

4957
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:17,390
think it more was I do think it's one of
the early demonstrations of evil AI yeah

4958
01:28:17,390 --> 01:28:17,400
the early demonstrations of evil AI yeah
 

4959
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:19,550
the early demonstrations of evil AI yeah
like can be taught bad I could push back

4960
01:28:19,550 --> 01:28:19,560
like can be taught bad I could push back
 

4961
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:22,010
like can be taught bad I could push back
on that because it's presented as evil

4962
01:28:22,010 --> 01:28:22,020
on that because it's presented as evil
 

4963
01:28:22,020 --> 01:28:24,770
on that because it's presented as evil
in the movie because it hurts the AI

4964
01:28:24,770 --> 01:28:24,780
in the movie because it hurts the AI
 

4965
01:28:24,780 --> 01:28:27,050
in the movie because it hurts the AI
hurts people but it's a really

4966
01:28:27,050 --> 01:28:27,060
hurts people but it's a really
 

4967
01:28:27,060 --> 01:28:28,910
hurts people but it's a really
interesting ethical question because the

4968
01:28:28,910 --> 01:28:28,920
interesting ethical question because the
 

4969
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:32,090
interesting ethical question because the
role of Hal 9000 is

4970
01:28:32,090 --> 01:28:32,100
role of Hal 9000 is
 

4971
01:28:32,100 --> 01:28:34,729
role of Hal 9000 is
um to carry out a successful mission

4972
01:28:34,729 --> 01:28:34,739
um to carry out a successful mission
 

4973
01:28:34,739 --> 01:28:36,950
um to carry out a successful mission
and so the question that is a human

4974

interesting ways to do this the right
way and I don't think anyone has an

way and I don't think anyone has an
 

5029

uh difficult complex human questions
 

5073
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:24,890
uh difficult complex human questions
being answered and we don't know about

being answered and we don't know about
 

5075
01:30:24,900 --> 01:30:27,169
being answered and we don't know about
any of them as a society and so we can't

5076
01:30:27,169 --> 01:30:27,179
any of them as a society and so we can't
 

5077
01:30:27,179 --> 01:30:29,209
any of them as a society and so we can't
really have that conversation even

5078
01:30:29,209 --> 01:30:29,219
really have that conversation even
 

5079
01:30:29,219 --> 01:30:30,590
really have that conversation even
though that conversation would be great

5080
01:30:30,590 --> 01:30:30,600
though that conversation would be great
 

5081
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:32,629
though that conversation would be great
for hiring it would be great for

5082
01:30:32,629 --> 01:30:32,639
for hiring it would be great for
 

5083
01:30:32,639 --> 01:30:35,090
for hiring it would be great for
revealing the complexities of what the

5084
01:30:35,090 --> 01:30:35,100
revealing the complexities of what the
 

5085
01:30:35,100 --> 01:30:36,530
revealing the complexities of what the
company is facing so when the company

5086
01:30:36,530 --> 01:30:36,540
company is facing so when the company
 

5087
01:30:36,540 --> 01:30:38,990
company is facing so when the company
makes mistakes you understand that it

5088
01:30:38,990 --> 01:30:39,000
makes mistakes you understand that it
 

5089
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:39,850
makes mistakes you understand that it
wasn't

5090
01:30:39,850 --> 01:30:39,860
wasn't
 

5091
01:30:39,860 --> 01:30:42,830
wasn't
malevolence or half-assedness and the

5092
01:30:42,830 --> 01:30:42,840
malevolence or half-assedness and the
 

5093
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:44,209
malevolence or half-assedness and the
decision making is just a really hard

5094
01:30:44,209 --> 01:30:44,219
decision making is just a really hard
 

5095
01:30:44,219 --> 01:30:46,490
decision making is just a really hard
problem and so I think transparency is

5096
01:30:46,490 --> 01:30:46,500
problem and so I think transparency is
 

5097
01:30:46,500 --> 01:30:48,470
problem and so I think transparency is
just good for everybody

5098
01:30:48,470 --> 01:30:48,480
just good for everybody
 

5099
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:52,610
just good for everybody
um and I mean in general just having a

5100
01:30:52,610 --> 01:30:52,620
um and I mean in general just having a
 

5101
01:30:52,620 --> 01:30:54,890
um and I mean in general just having a
lot of public conversations about this

5102
01:30:54,890 --> 01:30:54,900
lot of public conversations about this
 

5103
01:30:54,900 --> 01:30:57,350
lot of public conversations about this
is serious stuff it's uh

5104
01:30:57,350 --> 01:30:57,360
is serious stuff it's uh
 

5105
01:30:57,360 --> 01:30:59,750
is serious stuff it's uh
um that AI will have a transformative

5106
01:30:59,750 --> 01:30:59,760
um that AI will have a transformative
 

5107
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:02,209
um that AI will have a transformative
impact on our society and it might do so

5108
01:31:02,209 --> 01:31:02,219
impact on our society and it might do so
 

5109
01:31:02,219 --> 01:31:04,430
impact on our society and it might do so
very very quickly through all kinds of

01:31:29,159 --> 01:31:30,830
which we depend the infrastructure in
which we depend we need to know all

5132
01:31:30,830 --> 01:31:30,840
which we depend we need to know all
 

5133
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:33,590
which we depend we need to know all
about those AI decisions and it's not as

5134
01:31:33,590 --> 01:31:33,600
about those AI decisions and it's not as
 

5135
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:35,930
about those AI decisions and it's not as
simple as well we don't want the AI to

5136
01:31:35,930 --> 01:31:35,940
simple as well we don't want the AI to
 

5137
01:31:35,940 --> 01:31:36,729
simple as well we don't want the AI to
say

5138
01:31:36,729 --> 01:31:36,739
say
 

5139
01:31:36,739 --> 01:31:39,770
say
these specific set of bad things it's

5140
01:31:39,770 --> 01:31:39,780
these specific set of bad things it's
 

5141
01:31:39,780 --> 01:31:41,390
these specific set of bad things it's
unfortunately I don't believe it's

5142
01:31:41,390 --> 01:31:41,400
unfortunately I don't believe it's
 

5143
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:44,530
unfortunately I don't believe it's
possible to it's not uh prevent

5144
01:31:44,530 --> 01:31:44,540
possible to it's not uh prevent
 

5145
01:31:44,540 --> 01:31:49,669
possible to it's not uh prevent
evil or uh bad things by creating a set

5146
01:31:49,669 --> 01:31:49,679
evil or uh bad things by creating a set
 

5147
01:31:49,679 --> 01:31:52,490
evil or uh bad things by creating a set
of cold mathematical rules yeah

5148
01:31:52,490 --> 01:31:52,500
of cold mathematical rules yeah
 

5149
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:54,350
of cold mathematical rules yeah
unfortunately it's all fuzzy and gray

5150
01:31:54,350 --> 01:31:54,360
unfortunately it's all fuzzy and gray
 

5151
01:31:54,360 --> 01:31:56,629
unfortunately it's all fuzzy and gray
areas it's all giant mess it is I mean

5152
01:31:56,629 --> 01:31:56,639
areas it's all giant mess it is I mean
 

5153
01:31:56,639 --> 01:31:58,010
areas it's all giant mess it is I mean
you think about it Like a Knife a knife

5154
01:31:58,010 --> 01:31:58,020
you think about it Like a Knife a knife
 

5155
01:31:58,020 --> 01:31:59,810
you think about it Like a Knife a knife
can do good and a knife can do bad okay

5156
01:31:59,810 --> 01:31:59,820
can do good and a knife can do bad okay
 

5157
01:31:59,820 --> 01:32:02,149
can do good and a knife can do bad okay
you can't it's very hard it can't man

5158
01:32:02,149 --> 01:32:02,159
you can't it's very hard it can't man
 

5159
01:32:02,159 --> 01:32:05,330
you can't it's very hard it can't man
nice you can't ban knives and that this

5160
01:32:05,330 --> 01:32:05,340
nice you can't ban knives and that this
 

5161
01:32:05,340 --> 01:32:08,090
nice you can't ban knives and that this
is I think back it was probably 20 I

5162
01:32:08,090 --> 01:32:08,100
is I think back it was probably 20 I
 

5163
01:32:08,100 --> 01:32:10,550
is I think back it was probably 20 I
don't know 15 16. we did principles of

5164
01:32:10,550 --> 01:32:10,560
don't know 15 16. we did principles of
 

5165
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:12,169
don't know 15 16. we did principles of
trust and transparency notice the word

5166
01:32:12,169 --> 01:32:12,179
trust and transparency notice the word
 

5167
01:32:12,179 --> 01:32:14,930
trust and transparency notice the word
transparency that belief that with AI it

5168
01:32:14,930 --> 01:32:14,940
transparency that belief that with AI it
 

5169
01:32:14,940 --> 01:32:16,490
transparency that belief that with AI it
should be explainable you should know

5170
01:32:16,490 --> 01:32:16,500
should be explainable you should know
 

5171
01:32:16,500 --> 01:32:18,229
should be explainable you should know
who taught it you should know the data

5172
01:32:18,229 --> 01:32:18,239
who taught it you should know the data
 

5173
01:32:18,239 --> 01:32:20,030
who taught it you should know the data
that went into training it you should

5174
01:32:20,030 --> 01:32:20,040
that went into training it you should
 

5175
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:22,310
that went into training it you should
know who How It Was Written if it's

5176
01:32:22,310 --> 01:32:22,320
know who How It Was Written if it's
 

5177
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:23,990
know who How It Was Written if it's
being used you have a right to know

5178
01:32:23,990 --> 01:32:24,000
being used you have a right to know
 

5179
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:25,370
being used you have a right to know
these things and I I think those are

5180
01:32:25,370 --> 01:32:25,380
these things and I I think those are
 

5181
01:32:25,380 --> 01:32:28,010
these things and I I think those are
pretty to this day really powerful

5182
01:32:28,010 --> 01:32:28,020
pretty to this day really powerful
 

5183
01:32:28,020 --> 01:32:30,830
pretty to this day really powerful
principles to be followed right and and

5184
01:32:30,830 --> 01:32:30,840
principles to be followed right and and
 

5185
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:32,149
principles to be followed right and and
part of it we ended up writing because

5186
01:32:32,149 --> 01:32:32,159
part of it we ended up writing because
 

5187
01:32:32,159 --> 01:32:33,410
part of it we ended up writing because
here we were when we're working on

5188
01:32:33,410 --> 01:32:33,420
here we were when we're working on
 

5189
01:32:33,420 --> 01:32:35,750
here we were when we're working on
particularly Healthcare like okay you

5190
01:32:35,750 --> 01:32:35,760
particularly Healthcare like okay you
 

5191
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:38,149
particularly Healthcare like okay you
care who trained it in what and and

5192
01:32:38,149 --> 01:32:38,159
care who trained it in what and and
 

5193
01:32:38,159 --> 01:32:39,890
care who trained it in what and and
where it and that's uh that's sort of

5194
01:32:39,890 --> 01:32:39,900
where it and that's uh that's sort of
 

5195
01:32:39,900 --> 01:32:41,450
where it and that's uh that's sort of
simple you know that comes to your mind

5196
01:32:41,450 --> 01:32:41,460
simple you know that comes to your mind
 

5197
01:32:41,460 --> 01:32:42,590
simple you know that comes to your mind
you're like yeah that makes a lot of

5198
01:32:42,590 --> 01:32:42,600
you're like yeah that makes a lot of
 

5199
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:43,790
you're like yeah that makes a lot of
sense for something important like that

5200
01:32:43,790 --> 01:32:43,800
sense for something important like that
 

5201
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:45,530
sense for something important like that
but it's just in General

5202
01:32:45,530 --> 01:32:45,540
but it's just in General
 

5203
01:32:45,540 --> 01:32:47,570
but it's just in General
people won't trust the Technologies I

5204
01:32:47,570 --> 01:32:47,580
people won't trust the Technologies I
 

5205
01:32:47,580 --> 01:32:49,010
people won't trust the Technologies I
don't think unless they have

5206
01:32:49,010 --> 01:32:49,020
don't think unless they have
 

5207
01:32:49,020 --> 01:32:50,930
don't think unless they have
transparency into those things in the

5208
01:32:50,930 --> 01:32:50,940
transparency into those things in the
 

5209
01:32:50,940 --> 01:32:52,910
transparency into those things in the
end they won't really trust it I think a

5210
01:32:52,910 --> 01:32:52,920
end they won't really trust it I think a
 

5211
01:32:52,920 --> 01:32:54,890
end they won't really trust it I think a
lot of people would like to know

5212
01:32:54,890 --> 01:32:54,900
lot of people would like to know
 

5213
01:32:54,900 --> 01:32:58,669
lot of people would like to know
sort of um because a lot a lot of us I

5214
01:32:58,669 --> 01:32:58,679
sort of um because a lot a lot of us I
 

5215
01:32:58,679 --> 01:33:00,290
sort of um because a lot a lot of us I
certainly do suffer from imposter

5216
01:33:00,290 --> 01:33:00,300
certainly do suffer from imposter
 

5217
01:33:00,300 --> 01:33:03,470
certainly do suffer from imposter
syndrome that self-critical brain so you

5218
01:33:03,470 --> 01:33:03,480
syndrome that self-critical brain so you
 

5219
01:33:03,480 --> 01:33:05,390
syndrome that self-critical brain so you
know taking that big step into

5220
01:33:05,390 --> 01:33:05,400
know taking that big step into
 

5221
01:33:05,400 --> 01:33:07,129
know taking that big step into
leadership did you did you at times

5222
01:33:07,129 --> 01:33:07,139
leadership did you did you at times
 

5223
01:33:07,139 --> 01:33:08,930
leadership did you did you at times
suffer from imposter syndrome like how

5224
01:33:08,930 --> 01:33:08,940
suffer from imposter syndrome like how
 

5225
01:33:08,940 --> 01:33:10,790
suffer from imposter syndrome like how
did I get here do I really belong here

5226
01:33:10,790 --> 01:33:10,800
did I get here do I really belong here
 

5227
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:13,310
did I get here do I really belong here
or did you were you able to summon the

5228
01:33:13,310 --> 01:33:13,320
or did you were you able to summon the
 

5229
01:33:13,320 --> 01:33:15,110
or did you were you able to summon the
courage and sort of the confidence to

5230
01:33:15,110 --> 01:33:15,120
courage and sort of the confidence to
 

5231
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:20,209
courage and sort of the confidence to
really Step Up

5232
01:33:20,209 --> 01:33:20,219

 

5233
01:33:20,219 --> 01:33:22,129

it's very natural for someone like no

5234
01:33:22,129 --> 01:33:22,139
it's very natural for someone like no
 

5235
01:33:22,139 --> 01:33:24,649
it's very natural for someone like no
matter like the bigger the job gets

5236
01:33:24,649 --> 01:33:24,659
matter like the bigger the job gets
 

5237
01:33:24,659 --> 01:33:27,050
matter like the bigger the job gets
you turn and you look to the left and

5238
01:33:27,050 --> 01:33:27,060
you turn and you look to the left and
 

5239
01:33:27,060 --> 01:33:28,790
you turn and you look to the left and
the right and you see people around you

5240
01:33:28,790 --> 01:33:28,800
the right and you see people around you
 

5241
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:31,129
the right and you see people around you
and you think what am I doing here right

5242
01:33:31,129 --> 01:33:31,139
and you think what am I doing here right
 

5243
01:33:31,139 --> 01:33:34,610
and you think what am I doing here right
but then you remember what you do and

5244
01:33:34,610 --> 01:33:34,620
but then you remember what you do and
 

5245
01:33:34,620 --> 01:33:37,490
but then you remember what you do and
there's no one else doing it and so you

5246
01:33:37,490 --> 01:33:37,500
there's no one else doing it and so you
 

5247
01:33:37,500 --> 01:33:40,250
there's no one else doing it and so you
get that confidence so I do hear a lot

5248
01:33:40,250 --> 01:33:40,260
get that confidence so I do hear a lot
 

5249
01:33:40,260 --> 01:33:41,810
get that confidence so I do hear a lot
of people talk about imposter syndrome

5250
01:33:41,810 --> 01:33:41,820
of people talk about imposter syndrome
 

5251
01:33:41,820 --> 01:33:44,870
of people talk about imposter syndrome
right and

5252
01:33:44,870 --> 01:33:44,880
right and
 

5253
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:47,570
right and
I kind of actually this past year I've

5254
01:33:47,570 --> 01:33:47,580
I kind of actually this past year I've
 

5255
01:33:47,580 --> 01:33:49,010
I kind of actually this past year I've
spent some time helping people on that

5256
01:33:49,010 --> 01:33:49,020
spent some time helping people on that
 

5257
01:33:49,020 --> 01:33:53,390
spent some time helping people on that
topic and

5258
01:33:53,390 --> 01:33:53,400

 

5259
01:33:53,400 --> 01:33:54,950

part of the story so you have to believe

5260
01:33:54,950 --> 01:33:54,960
part of the story so you have to believe
 

5261
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:56,149
part of the story so you have to believe
you you

5262
01:33:56,149 --> 01:33:56,159
you you
 

5263
01:33:56,159 --> 01:33:58,070
you you
have a right to be around like anyone

5264
01:33:58,070 --> 01:33:58,080
have a right to be around like anyone
 

5265
01:33:58,080 --> 01:33:59,390
have a right to be around like anyone
else does if you've prepared for that

5266
01:33:59,390 --> 01:33:59,400
else does if you've prepared for that
 

5267
01:33:59,400 --> 01:34:01,189
else does if you've prepared for that
moment you know and so

5268
01:34:01,189 --> 01:34:01,199
moment you know and so
 

5269
01:34:01,199 --> 01:34:03,770
moment you know and so
it's a bit more of a

5270
01:34:03,770 --> 01:34:03,780
it's a bit more of a
 

5271
01:34:03,780 --> 01:34:05,209
it's a bit more of a
I know it's hard to say it like a

5272
01:34:05,209 --> 01:34:05,219
I know it's hard to say it like a
 

5273
01:34:05,219 --> 01:34:06,770
I know it's hard to say it like a
confidence thing more than anything else

5274
01:34:06,770 --> 01:34:06,780
confidence thing more than anything else
 

5275
01:34:06,780 --> 01:34:09,410
confidence thing more than anything else
so yes there are times I look around but

5276
01:34:09,410 --> 01:34:09,420
so yes there are times I look around but
 

5277
01:34:09,420 --> 01:34:11,870
so yes there are times I look around but
then I think wow I'm in a position to

5278
01:34:11,870 --> 01:34:11,880
then I think wow I'm in a position to
 

5279
01:34:11,880 --> 01:34:14,390
then I think wow I'm in a position to
make something change so I I can't say I

5280
01:34:14,390 --> 01:34:14,400
make something change so I I can't say I
 

5281
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:16,370
make something change so I I can't say I
have ever really dwelled on that feeling

5282
01:34:16,370 --> 01:34:16,380
have ever really dwelled on that feeling
 

5283
01:34:16,380 --> 01:34:17,990
have ever really dwelled on that feeling
for long okay so you just focused on the

5284
01:34:17,990 --> 01:34:18,000

questions and that's why actually I'm
 

5535
01:38:39,780 --> 01:38:41,990
questions and that's why actually I'm
okay talking about it because there were

5536
01:38:41,990 --> 01:38:42,000
okay talking about it because there were
 

5537
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:43,550
okay talking about it because there were
times I felt it right there were times

5538
