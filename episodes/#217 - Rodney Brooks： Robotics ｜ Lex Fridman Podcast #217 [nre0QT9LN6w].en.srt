robot
 

183
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,750
robot
it's making a promise for how well it

184
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:21,760
it's making a promise for how well it
 

185
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,070
it's making a promise for how well it
will be able to interact so i always

186
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:24,080
will be able to interact so i always

not to over promise you know even with

190
00:03:28,149 --> 00:03:28,159
not to over promise you know even with
 

191
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,630
not to over promise you know even with
its essence like the thing it presents

it should not over promise yeah so i the

194
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:32,640
it should not over promise yeah so i the
 

195
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,710
it should not over promise yeah so i the
the joke i make which i think you'll get

196
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:34,720

197
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,630
the joke i make which i think you'll get
is if your robot looks like albert

198
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:36,640
is if your robot looks like albert
 

199
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,550
is if your robot looks like albert
einstein it should be as smart as albert

200
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:38,560
einstein it should be as smart as albert
 

201
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,869
einstein it should be as smart as albert
einstein so

202
00:03:40,869 --> 00:03:40,879
einstein so
 

203
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,390
einstein so
the only thing in in

204
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:42,400
the only thing in in
 

205
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,070
the only thing in in
domo's face is

206
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:44,080
domo's face is
 

207
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,110
domo's face is
the eyeballs um and because that's all

208
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:47,120
the eyeballs um and because that's all
 

209
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,710
the eyeballs um and because that's all
it can do it can look at you and pay

210
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:48,720
it can do it can look at you and pay
 

211
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,949
it can do it can look at you and pay
attention um and

212
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:50,959
attention um and
 

213
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,630
attention um and
so there is no

214
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:52,640
so there is no
 

215
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,470
so there is no
it's not like one of those

216
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:54,480
it's not like one of those
 

217
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,949
it's not like one of those
um japanese robots that looks exactly

218
00:03:56,949 --> 00:03:56,959
um japanese robots that looks exactly
 

219
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,789
um japanese robots that looks exactly
like a person at all

220
00:03:58,789 --> 00:03:58,799
like a person at all
 

221
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,429
like a person at all
but see the thing is us humans and dogs

222
00:04:01,429 --> 00:04:01,439
but see the thing is us humans and dogs
 

223
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,710
but see the thing is us humans and dogs
too

224

too
 

225
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,110
too
don't just use eyes for it as

226
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:05,120
don't just use eyes for it as
 

227
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,670
don't just use eyes for it as
attentional mechanisms they also use it

228
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:07,680
attentional mechanisms they also use it
 

229
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,030
attentional mechanisms they also use it
to communicate it's part of the

230
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:09,040
to communicate it's part of the
 

231
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,190
to communicate it's part of the
communication like a dog can look at you

00:04:12,869 --> 00:04:12,879
look at another thing and look back at
 

235
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,949
look at another thing and look back at
you and that designates that we're going

intent you know in on on both baxter and
 

241
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,870
intent you know in on on both baxter and
sawyer at rethink robotics they had a

242
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:22,880
sawyer at rethink robotics they had a
 

243
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,310
sawyer at rethink robotics they had a
screen with you know graphic eyes so it

244
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:26,320
screen with you know graphic eyes so it
 

245
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,909
screen with you know graphic eyes so it
wasn't actually where the cameras were

246
00:04:27,909 --> 00:04:27,919
wasn't actually where the cameras were
 

247
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:29,830
wasn't actually where the cameras were
pointing but it

248
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:29,840
pointing but it
 

249
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,749
pointing but it
the the eyes would look in the direction

250
00:04:31,749 --> 00:04:31,759
the the eyes would look in the direction
 

251
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,070
the the eyes would look in the direction
it was about to move its arm so people

252
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:34,080
it was about to move its arm so people
 

253
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,990
it was about to move its arm so people
in the factory nearby were not surprised

254
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:36,000
in the factory nearby were not surprised
 

255
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,469
in the factory nearby were not surprised
by its motions because it gave that

256
00:04:38,469 --> 00:04:38,479
by its motions because it gave that
 

257

intent away
before we talk about baxter which i

260
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:42,240
before we talk about baxter which i
 

261
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,390
before we talk about baxter which i
think is a beautiful robot

262
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:44,400
think is a beautiful robot
 

263
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,150

you first
 

267
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,590
you first
fall in love with robotics we're talking

268
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:49,600
fall in love with robotics we're talking
 

269
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,950
fall in love with robotics we're talking
about beauty and love to open the

270
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:50,960
about beauty and love to open the
 

271
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,270
about beauty and love to open the
conversation this is great

272
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:53,280
conversation this is great
 

273

so i'm guessing my mother found them in
 

283
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,270
so i'm guessing my mother found them in
a store in 62 or 63.

295
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,189

i learned how to build circuits you know

296
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:23,199
i learned how to build circuits you know
 

297
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,189
i learned how to build circuits you know
when i was eight or nine simple circuits

298
00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:25,199
when i was eight or nine simple circuits
 

299
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,270
when i was eight or nine simple circuits
and i and i read you know learned the

300

and i and i read you know learned the
 

301
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,270
and i and i read you know learned the
binary system and

302
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:29,280
binary system and
 

303
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,029
binary system and
um saw all these

304
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:31,039
um saw all these
 

305
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,629
um saw all these
drawings mostly uh of robots and um then

306
00:05:34,629 --> 00:05:34,639
drawings mostly uh of robots and um then
 

307
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,830
drawings mostly uh of robots and um then
i tried to build them for the rest of my

308

childhood wait
 

311
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,590
childhood wait
61 you said this was when the two books

312
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:41,600
61 you said this was when the two books
 

313
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,430
61 you said this was when the two books
i've still got the at home what what

314
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:43,440
i've still got the at home what what
 

315
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,909
i've still got the at home what what
does the robot mean in that context no

316
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:45,919
does the robot mean in that context no
 

317
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,230
does the robot mean in that context no
they they were some of the robots that

318
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:48,240
they they were some of the robots that
 

319
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,390
they they were some of the robots that
they had were

320
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:50,400
they had were
 

321
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,790
they had were
arms you know big arms to move nuclear

322
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:52,800
arms you know big arms to move nuclear
 

323
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,590
arms you know big arms to move nuclear
material around but they had pictures of

324
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:55,600
material around but they had pictures of
 

325
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,670
material around but they had pictures of
welding robots that looked like humans

326
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:57,680
welding robots that looked like humans
 

327
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,550
welding robots that looked like humans
under the sea welding stuff underwater

328
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:00,560
under the sea welding stuff underwater
 

329
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,909
under the sea welding stuff underwater
um so they weren't real robots uh but

330
00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:03,919
um so they weren't real robots uh but
 

331
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,189
um so they weren't real robots uh but
they were you know what people were

332
00:06:05,189 --> 00:06:05,199
they were you know what people were
 

333
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,189
they were you know what people were
thinking about for robots

334
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:07,199
thinking about for robots
 

335
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,870
thinking about for robots
what were you thinking about were you

336
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:08,880
what were you thinking about were you
 

337
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,230
what were you thinking about were you
thinking about humanoids were you

338
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:10,240
thinking about humanoids were you
 

339
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,909
thinking about humanoids were you
thinking about arms with fingers were

340
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:11,919
thinking about arms with fingers were
 

341
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,230
thinking about arms with fingers were
you thinking about faces or cars no

342
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:14,240
you thinking about faces or cars no
 

343
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,550
you thinking about faces or cars no
actually to be honest i realized my

344
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:16,560
actually to be honest i realized my
 

345
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,270
actually to be honest i realized my
limitation on building mechanical stuff

346
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:19,280
limitation on building mechanical stuff
 

347
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,150
limitation on building mechanical stuff
so i just built um the brains

348
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:22,160
so i just built um the brains
 

349
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,550
so i just built um the brains
mostly i out of

350
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:24,560
mostly i out of
 

351
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,990
mostly i out of
different technologies as i got older

352
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:28,000
different technologies as i got older
 

353
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,990
different technologies as i got older
i built a

354
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:30,000
i built a
 

355
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,070
i built a
learning system which

356
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:32,080
learning system which
 

357
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,309
learning system which
was chemical based and i had this ice

358
00:06:34,309 --> 00:06:34,319
was chemical based and i had this ice
 

359
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,230
was chemical based and i had this ice
cube tray each

360
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:36,240
cube tray each
 

361
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,909
cube tray each
well was a cell

362
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:37,919
well was a cell
 

363
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,790
well was a cell
and by applying voltage to the two

364
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:40,800
and by applying voltage to the two
 

365
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,710
and by applying voltage to the two
electrodes it would build up a copper

366
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:42,720
electrodes it would build up a copper
 

367
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,110
electrodes it would build up a copper
bridge so over time it would it would

368
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:45,120
bridge so over time it would it would
 

369
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,469
bridge so over time it would it would
learn

370
00:06:46,469 --> 00:06:46,479
learn
 

371
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,270
learn
a simple network um so i could teach it

372
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:49,280
a simple network um so i could teach it
 

373
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,990
a simple network um so i could teach it
stuff and that was

374
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:52,000
stuff and that was
 

375
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,469
stuff and that was
mostly things were driven by my budget

376
00:06:54,469 --> 00:06:54,479
mostly things were driven by my budget
 

377
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,070
mostly things were driven by my budget
and nails as electrodes and a an ice

378
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:58,080
and nails as electrodes and a an ice
 

379
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,710
and nails as electrodes and a an ice
cream i mean an ice cube tray was was

380
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:00,720
cream i mean an ice cube tray was was
 

381
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,629
cream i mean an ice cube tray was was
about my budget at that stage later i

382
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:02,639
about my budget at that stage later i
 

383
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,870
about my budget at that stage later i
managed to buy transistors and then i

384
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:04,880
managed to buy transistors and then i
 

385
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,870
managed to buy transistors and then i
could build gates and flip-flops and

386
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:06,880
could build gates and flip-flops and
 

387
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,670
could build gates and flip-flops and
stuff so so one one of your first robots

388
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:09,680
stuff so so one one of your first robots
 

389
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,870
stuff so so one one of your first robots
was an ice cube tray yeah

390
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:12,880
was an ice cube tray yeah
 

391
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,390
was an ice cube tray yeah
and it was very cerebral because it

392
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:14,400
and it was very cerebral because it
 

393
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,710
and it was very cerebral because it
learned to add

394
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:16,720
learned to add
 

395
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,430
learned to add
very nice uh well

396
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:19,440
very nice uh well
 

397
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,510
very nice uh well
just a decade or so before in 1950 alan

398
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:23,520
just a decade or so before in 1950 alan
 

399
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,469
just a decade or so before in 1950 alan
turing

400
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:24,479
turing
 

401
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,150
turing
wrote the paper that formulated the

402
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:26,160
wrote the paper that formulated the
 

403
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,469
wrote the paper that formulated the
touring test and he opened that paper

404
00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:28,479
touring test and he opened that paper
 

405
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:29,670
touring test and he opened that paper
with the question

406
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:29,680
with the question
 

407
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,270
with the question
can machines

408
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:31,280
can machines
 

409
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,390
can machines
think

410
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:32,400
think
 

411
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,390
think
so let me ask you this question can

412
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:34,400
so let me ask you this question can
 

413
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,830
so let me ask you this question can
machines

414
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:35,840
machines
 

415
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,150
machines
think can your ice cube tray

416
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:38,160
think can your ice cube tray
 

417
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,909
think can your ice cube tray
one day think

418
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:39,919
one day think
 

419
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,469
one day think
um certainly machines can think because

420
00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:42,479
um certainly machines can think because
 

421
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,150
um certainly machines can think because
i believe you're a machine and i'm a

422
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:44,160
i believe you're a machine and i'm a
 

423
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,790
i believe you're a machine and i'm a
machine and i believe we both think um i

424
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:46,800
machine and i believe we both think um i
 

425
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,550
machine and i believe we both think um i
think it's a big fear i think any other

426
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:48,560
think it's a big fear i think any other
 

427
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,629
think it's a big fear i think any other
philosophical position is sort of a

428
00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:50,639
philosophical position is sort of a
 

429
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,469
philosophical position is sort of a
little ludicrous what does think mean if

430
00:07:52,469 --> 00:07:52,479
little ludicrous what does think mean if
 

431
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,390
little ludicrous what does think mean if
if it's not something that we do

432
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:54,400
if it's not something that we do
 

433
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,189
if it's not something that we do
um and we and we are machines

434
00:07:57,189 --> 00:07:57,199
um and we and we are machines
 

435
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,230
um and we and we are machines
so yes machines can but do we have a

436
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:00,240
so yes machines can but do we have a
 

437
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,150
so yes machines can but do we have a
clue how to build such machines that's a

438
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:02,160
clue how to build such machines that's a
 

439
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,869
clue how to build such machines that's a
very different question are we capable

440
00:08:04,869 --> 00:08:04,879
very different question are we capable
 

441
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,869
very different question are we capable
of building such machines uh you know

442
00:08:06,869 --> 00:08:06,879
of building such machines uh you know
 

443
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,469
of building such machines uh you know
are we smart enough we think we're smart

444
00:08:08,469 --> 00:08:08,479
are we smart enough we think we're smart
 

445
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,150
are we smart enough we think we're smart
enough to do anything but

446
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:10,160
enough to do anything but
 

447
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,990
enough to do anything but
maybe we're not maybe you know we're

448
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:12,000
maybe we're not maybe you know we're
 

449
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,230
maybe we're not maybe you know we're
just not bad enough to build

450
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:14,240
just not bad enough to build
 

451
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,309
just not bad enough to build
stuff like us the kind of computer that

452
00:08:16,309 --> 00:08:16,319
stuff like us the kind of computer that
 

453
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,390
stuff like us the kind of computer that
uh alan turing was thinking about do you

454
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:18,400
uh alan turing was thinking about do you
 

455
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,070
uh alan turing was thinking about do you
think there is something

456
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:20,080
think there is something
 

457
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,909
think there is something
fundamentally

458
00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:21,919
fundamentally
 

459
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,830
fundamentally
uh or significantly different between

460
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:23,840
uh or significantly different between
 

461
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,830
uh or significantly different between
the computer between our ears the the

462
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:25,840
the computer between our ears the the
 

463
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,550
the computer between our ears the the
biological computer that humans use

464
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:28,560
biological computer that humans use
 

465
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,790
biological computer that humans use
and uh the computer that he was thinking

466
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:30,800
and uh the computer that he was thinking
 

467
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,509
and uh the computer that he was thinking
about from a from a sort of high level

468
00:08:33,509 --> 00:08:33,519
about from a from a sort of high level
 

469
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,630
about from a from a sort of high level
philosophical yeah i believe it uh

470
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:36,640
philosophical yeah i believe it uh
 

471
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,029
philosophical yeah i believe it uh
that's very wrong in fact i'm

472
00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:39,039
that's very wrong in fact i'm
 

473
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,469
that's very wrong in fact i'm
halfway through a

474
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:40,479
halfway through a
 

475
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,110
halfway through a
i think it'll be about a 480 page book

476
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:43,120
i think it'll be about a 480 page book
 

477
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,310
i think it'll be about a 480 page book
um

478
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:44,320
um
 

479
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,389
um

00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,990
wrong
and if i may i'll tell you a bit about

484
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:50,000
and if i may i'll tell you a bit about

the other two had been already been
 

541
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,470
the other two had been already been
disproved by godel so turing set out to

542
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:58,480
disproved by godel so turing set out to
 

543
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,829
disproved by godel so turing set out to
disprove it because that's it's always

544
00:09:59,829 --> 00:09:59,839
disprove it because that's it's always
 

545
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,990
disprove it because that's it's always
easier to disprove these things than to

00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:02,000
easier to disprove these things than to
 

547
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,910
easier to disprove these things than to
prove that there is an answer and um

548
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:05,920
prove that there is an answer and um
 

549
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,310

there a mechanical process so he wanted

558
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:17,040
there a mechanical process so he wanted
 

559
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,269
there a mechanical process so he wanted
to have a show a mechanical process that

560
00:10:19,269 --> 00:10:19,279
to have a show a mechanical process that
 

561
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,470
to have a show a mechanical process that
could

562
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:20,480
could
 

563
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,870
could
calculate numbers

564
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:22,880
calculate numbers
 

565
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,430
calculate numbers
because that was a mechanical process

566
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:25,440
because that was a mechanical process
 

567
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,910
because that was a mechanical process
that people used to generate tables they

568
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:27,920
that people used to generate tables they
 

569
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,069
that people used to generate tables they
were called computers the people at the

570
00:10:30,069 --> 00:10:30,079
were called computers the people at the
 

571
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,069
were called computers the people at the
time and they followed a set of rules

572
00:10:32,069 --> 00:10:32,079
time and they followed a set of rules
 

573
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,230
time and they followed a set of rules
where they had paper and they would

574
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:34,240
where they had paper and they would
 

575
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,069
where they had paper and they would
write numbers down and based on the

576
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:36,079
write numbers down and based on the
 

577
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,030
write numbers down and based on the
numbers that keep writing other numbers

578
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:39,040
numbers that keep writing other numbers
 

579
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,509
numbers that keep writing other numbers
and they would produce

580
00:10:41,509 --> 00:10:41,519
and they would produce
 

581
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,509
and they would produce
numbers for these tables engineering

582
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:43,519
numbers for these tables engineering
 

583
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:44,630
numbers for these tables engineering
tables

584
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:44,640
tables
 

585
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,949
tables
that the more the more iterations they

586
00:10:46,949 --> 00:10:46,959
that the more the more iterations they
 

587
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,750
that the more the more iterations they
did the more significant digits came out

588
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:49,760
did the more significant digits came out
 

589
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,269
did the more significant digits came out
and so turing

590
00:10:51,269 --> 00:10:51,279
and so turing
 

591
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,069
and so turing
in that paper set out to

592
00:10:54,069 --> 00:10:54,079
in that paper set out to
 

593
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,389
in that paper set out to
define what sort of machine could do

594
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:56,399
define what sort of machine could do
 

595
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,269
define what sort of machine could do
that mechanical machine

596
00:10:59,269 --> 00:10:59,279
that mechanical machine
 

597
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,710
that mechanical machine
where it could produce an arbitrary

00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:00,720
where it could produce an arbitrary
 

599
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,630
where it could produce an arbitrary
number of digits

600
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:02,640
number of digits
 

601
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,430
number of digits
in the same way a human computer did

602
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:07,440
in the same way a human computer did
 

603
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,949
in the same way a human computer did
and he came up with a very simple

604
00:11:10,949 --> 00:11:10,959
and he came up with a very simple
 

605
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,430
and he came up with a very simple
set of constraints where there was an

606
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:13,440
set of constraints where there was an
 

607
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,990
set of constraints where there was an
infinite supply of paper this is the

608
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:16,000
infinite supply of paper this is the
 

609
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,990
infinite supply of paper this is the
tape of the turing machine

610
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:18,000
tape of the turing machine
 

611
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,310
tape of the turing machine
and each turing machine had a

612
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:20,320
and each turing machine had a
 

613
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,310
and each turing machine had a
set of it came with a set of

614
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:22,320
set of it came with a set of
 

615
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,310
set of it came with a set of
instructions that

616
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:24,320
instructions that
 

617
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,550
instructions that
as a person could do with pencil and

618
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:26,560
as a person could do with pencil and
 

619
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,470
as a person could do with pencil and
paper write down things on the tape and

620
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:28,480
paper write down things on the tape and
 

621
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,949
paper write down things on the tape and
erase them and put new things there

622
00:11:30,949 --> 00:11:30,959
erase them and put new things there
 

623
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,069
erase them and put new things there
and

624
00:11:32,069 --> 00:11:32,079
and
 

625
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,829
and
he was able to show that that system was

626
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:35,839
he was able to show that that system was
 

627
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,509
he was able to show that that system was
not able to do something that hilbert

628
00:11:37,509 --> 00:11:37,519
not able to do something that hilbert
 

629
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,630
not able to do something that hilbert
hypothesized so he disproved it but he

630
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:40,640
hypothesized so he disproved it but he
 

631
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,949
hypothesized so he disproved it but he
had to show this was this this system

632
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:42,959
had to show this was this this system
 

633
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:43,750
had to show this was this this system
was

634
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:43,760
was
 

635
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,430
was
good enough to do

636
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:45,440
good enough to do
 

637
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,269
good enough to do
whatever could be done but couldn't do

638
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:47,279
whatever could be done but couldn't do
 

639
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,069
whatever could be done but couldn't do
this other thing yeah and there he said

640
00:11:50,069 --> 00:11:50,079
this other thing yeah and there he said
 

641
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,310
this other thing yeah and there he said
and he says in the paper i don't have

642
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:52,320
and he says in the paper i don't have
 

643
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,629
and he says in the paper i don't have
any real arguments for this but based on

644
00:11:54,629 --> 00:11:54,639
any real arguments for this but based on
 

645
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:55,829
any real arguments for this but based on
intuition

646
00:11:55,829 --> 00:11:55,839
intuition
 

647
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,150
intuition
so that's how he defined computation

648
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:58,160
so that's how he defined computation
 

649
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,629
so that's how he defined computation
and then if you look over the next from

650
00:12:00,629 --> 00:12:00,639
and then if you look over the next from
 

651
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,629
and then if you look over the next from
1936 up until really around 1975

652
00:12:04,629 --> 00:12:04,639
1936 up until really around 1975
 

653
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,590
1936 up until really around 1975
you see people struggling with

654
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:07,600
you see people struggling with
 

655
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,150
you see people struggling with
is this really what computation is and

656
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:10,160
is this really what computation is and
 

657
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,110
is this really what computation is and
so marvin minsky very well known in ai

658
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:13,120
so marvin minsky very well known in ai
 

659
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,230
so marvin minsky very well known in ai
but also

660
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:14,240
but also
 

661
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,550
but also
a fantastic mathematician

662
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:16,560
a fantastic mathematician
 

663
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,470
a fantastic mathematician
uh in his book finite and infinite

664
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:18,480
uh in his book finite and infinite
 

665
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,629
uh in his book finite and infinite
machines from the mid 60s which is a

666
00:12:20,629 --> 00:12:20,639
machines from the mid 60s which is a
 

667
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,350
machines from the mid 60s which is a
beautiful beautiful mathematical book

668
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:23,360
beautiful beautiful mathematical book
 

669
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,509
beautiful beautiful mathematical book
um says says at the start of the book

670
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:25,519
um says says at the start of the book
 

671
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,269
um says says at the start of the book
well what is computation turing says

672
00:12:27,269 --> 00:12:27,279
well what is computation turing says
 

673
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,190
well what is computation turing says
it's this and yeah i sort of think it's

674
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:29,200
it's this and yeah i sort of think it's
 

675
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,710
it's this and yeah i sort of think it's
that it doesn't really matter whether

676
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:30,720
that it doesn't really matter whether
 

677
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,470
that it doesn't really matter whether
stuff's made of wood or plastic it's

678
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:32,480
stuff's made of wood or plastic it's
 

679
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,790
stuff's made of wood or plastic it's
just you know that relatively cheap

680
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:34,800
just you know that relatively cheap
 

681
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,069
just you know that relatively cheap
stuff can do this stuff and so yeah

682
00:12:38,069 --> 00:12:38,079
stuff can do this stuff and so yeah
 

683
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,150
stuff can do this stuff and so yeah
seems like computation

684
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:40,160
seems like computation
 

685
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,990
seems like computation
and donald knuth uh in his first volume

686
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:44,000

you know art of computer programming

690
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:47,440
you know art of computer programming
 

691
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,509
you know art of computer programming
in around 1968

692
00:12:49,509 --> 00:12:49,519
in around 1968
 

693
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,389
in around 1968
says well what's computation

694
00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:52,399
says well what's computation
 

695
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,629
says well what's computation
it's this stuff like turing says that a

696
00:12:54,629 --> 00:12:54,639
it's this stuff like turing says that a
 

697
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,870
it's this stuff like turing says that a
person could do each step without too

698
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:56,880
person could do each step without too
 

699
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,870
person could do each step without too
much trouble

700
00:12:58,870 --> 00:12:58,880
much trouble
 

701
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,790
much trouble
and so one of his examples of what would

702
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:00,800
and so one of his examples of what would
 

703
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,269
and so one of his examples of what would
be too much trouble was

704
00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:03,279
be too much trouble was
 

705
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,629
be too much trouble was
a step which required knowing whether

706
00:13:06,629 --> 00:13:06,639
a step which required knowing whether
 

707
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,470
a step which required knowing whether
fermat's last theorem was true or not

708
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:08,480
fermat's last theorem was true or not
 

709
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,230
fermat's last theorem was true or not
because it was not known at the time and

710
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:10,240
because it was not known at the time and
 

711
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,829
because it was not known at the time and
that's too much trouble for a person to

712
00:13:11,829 --> 00:13:11,839
that's too much trouble for a person to
 

713
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:13,590
that's too much trouble for a person to
do as a step

714
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:13,600
do as a step
 

715
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,110
do as a step
and um

716
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:15,120
and um
 

717
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,710
and um

719
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,710
hop craft and allman
sort of said a similar thing

720
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:18,720
sort of said a similar thing
 

721
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,790
sort of said a similar thing
later that year and by nineteen seventy

in the a ho up crop the norman book

726
00:13:23,509 --> 00:13:23,519
in the a ho up crop the norman book
 

727
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:24,550
in the a ho up crop the norman book
they're saying

728
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:24,560
they're saying
 

729
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,310
they're saying
well you know we don't really know what

730
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:26,320
well you know we don't really know what
 

731
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,629
well you know we don't really know what
computation is but intuition says this

732
00:13:28,629 --> 00:13:28,639
computation is but intuition says this
 

733
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,269
computation is but intuition says this
is sort of about right and this is what

734
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:31,279
is sort of about right and this is what
 

735
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,550
is sort of about right and this is what
it is

736
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:32,560
it is
 

737
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,750
it is
that's computation it's a sort of

738
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:35,760
that's computation it's a sort of
 

739
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,389
that's computation it's a sort of
agreed-upon thing which happens to be

740
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:38,399
agreed-upon thing which happens to be
 

741
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,870
agreed-upon thing which happens to be
really easy to implement in silicon and

742
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:40,880
really easy to implement in silicon and
 

743
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,189
really easy to implement in silicon and
then we had moore's law which took off

744
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:43,199
then we had moore's law which took off
 

745
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,030
then we had moore's law which took off
and it's been an incredibly powerful

746
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:45,040
and it's been an incredibly powerful
 

747
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:45,990
and it's been an incredibly powerful
tool

748
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:46,000
tool
 

749
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,750
tool
i certainly wouldn't argue with that the

750
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:47,760
i certainly wouldn't argue with that the
 

751
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,230
i certainly wouldn't argue with that the
version we have a computation incredibly

752
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:50,240
version we have a computation incredibly
 

753
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,949
version we have a computation incredibly
powerful can we just take a pause so

754
00:13:52,949 --> 00:13:52,959
powerful can we just take a pause so
 

755
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,870
powerful can we just take a pause so
what we're talking about is there's an

756
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:54,880
what we're talking about is there's an
 

757
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,629
what we're talking about is there's an
infinite tape with some simple rules on

758
00:13:56,629 --> 00:13:56,639
infinite tape with some simple rules on
 

759
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,949
infinite tape with some simple rules on
how to write and on that tape and that's

760
00:13:58,949 --> 00:13:58,959
how to write and on that tape and that's
 

761
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,389
how to write and on that tape and that's
that's what we're kind of thinking about

762
00:14:00,389 --> 00:14:00,399
that's what we're kind of thinking about
 

763
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:01,829
that's what we're kind of thinking about
this is computation yeah and it's

764
00:14:01,829 --> 00:14:01,839
this is computation yeah and it's
 

765
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,310
this is computation yeah and it's
modeled after humans how humans do stuff

766
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:04,320
modeled after humans how humans do stuff
 

767
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:04,949
modeled after humans how humans do stuff
and

768
00:14:04,949 --> 00:14:04,959
and
 

769
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:06,230
and
i think it's a

770
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:06,240
i think it's a
 

771
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,710
i think it's a
curing says in the 36 paper one of the

772
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:08,720
curing says in the 36 paper one of the
 

773
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,949
curing says in the 36 paper one of the
critical facts here is that a human has

774
00:14:10,949 --> 00:14:10,959
critical facts here is that a human has
 

775
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,030
critical facts here is that a human has
a limited amount of memory

776
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:13,040
a limited amount of memory
 

777
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,550
a limited amount of memory
so that's what we're going to put onto

778
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:14,560
so that's what we're going to put onto
 

779
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,269
so that's what we're going to put onto
our

780
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:15,279
our
 

781
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:19,189
our
mechanical computers so

782
00:14:19,189 --> 00:14:19,199

 

783
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,110

so you know unlike mass

784
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:21,120
so you know unlike mass
 

785
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,389
so you know unlike mass
unlike mass or charge or yeah it's not

786
00:14:24,389 --> 00:14:24,399
unlike mass or charge or yeah it's not
 

787
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,389
unlike mass or charge or yeah it's not
it's it's not given by the universe it

788
00:14:26,389 --> 00:14:26,399
it's it's not given by the universe it
 

789
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:27,110
it's it's not given by the universe it
was

790
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:27,120
was
 

791
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,069
was
this is what we're going to call

792
00:14:28,069 --> 00:14:28,079
this is what we're going to call
 

793
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,069
this is what we're going to call
computation yeah and then it has this

794
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:30,079
computation yeah and then it has this
 

795
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,189
computation yeah and then it has this
really

796
00:14:31,189 --> 00:14:31,199
really
 

797
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,629
really
you know it had this really good

798
00:14:32,629 --> 00:14:32,639
you know it had this really good
 

799
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,629
you know it had this really good
implementation which has completely

800
00:14:34,629 --> 00:14:34,639
implementation which has completely
 

801

that's interesting there was
 

849
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,430
that's interesting there was
neuroscience before but it wasn't

and furthermore
 

861
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:36,310
and furthermore
there were a lot of players who are

862
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:36,320
there were a lot of players who are
 

863
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,990
there were a lot of players who are
common across them

864

00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,110
the book one is titled wait
computers are people because that's

988
00:17:59,110 --> 00:17:59,120
computers are people because that's
 

989
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,909
computers are people because that's
where our computers came from yeah

990
00:18:01,909 --> 00:18:01,919
where our computers came from yeah
 

991
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,390
where our computers came from yeah
and you know from people who are

992
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:04,400
and you know from people who are
 

993
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,750
and you know from people who are
computing stuff and then i've got

994
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:05,760
computing stuff and then i've got
 

995
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,110
computing stuff and then i've got
another chapter

996
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:07,120
another chapter
 

997
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,510
another chapter
wait people are computers which is about

998
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:09,520
wait people are computers which is about
 

999
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,590
wait people are computers which is about
computational neuroscience yes so

1000
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:11,600
computational neuroscience yes so
 

1001
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,110
computational neuroscience yes so
there's this whole circle here and that

1002
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:15,120
there's this whole circle here and that
 

1003
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,909
there's this whole circle here and that
competition is it and you know i have

1004
00:18:17,909 --> 00:18:17,919
competition is it and you know i have
 

1005
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,310
competition is it and you know i have
talked to to people about well maybe

1006
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:20,320
talked to to people about well maybe
 

1007
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,310
talked to to people about well maybe
it's not computation that goes on in the

1008
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:22,320
it's not computation that goes on in the
 

1009
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:27,750
it's not computation that goes on in the
head of course it is yeah okay well

1010
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:27,760

 

1011
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,230

when elon musk's rocket goes up is it

1012
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:30,240
when elon musk's rocket goes up is it
 

1013
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,510
when elon musk's rocket goes up is it
computing

1014
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:31,520
computing
 

1015
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,950
computing
is that how it gets into orbit by

1016
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:32,960
is that how it gets into orbit by
 

1017
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,070
is that how it gets into orbit by
computing

1018
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:34,080
computing
 

1019
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,270
computing
but we've got this idea if you want to

1020
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:35,280
but we've got this idea if you want to
 

1021
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,510
but we've got this idea if you want to
build an ai system you write a computer

1022
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:37,520
build an ai system you write a computer
 

1023
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,830
build an ai system you write a computer
program

1024
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:39,840
program
 

1025
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,350
program
yeah in a sense so the word computation

1026
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:43,360
yeah in a sense so the word computation
 

1027
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,590
yeah in a sense so the word computation
very quickly starts doing a lot of work

1028
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:45,600
very quickly starts doing a lot of work
 

1029
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,230
very quickly starts doing a lot of work
that it was not initially intended to to

1030
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:48,240
that it was not initially intended to to
 

1031
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,630
that it was not initially intended to to
do it's the second saying if you talk

1032
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:50,640
do it's the second saying if you talk
 

1033
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,630
do it's the second saying if you talk
about the universe as essentially

1034
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:52,640
about the universe as essentially
 

1035
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,390
about the universe as essentially
performing a computation yeah right

1036
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:54,400
performing a computation yeah right
 

1037
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,070
performing a computation yeah right
wolfram does this he turns it into

1038
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:56,080
wolfram does this he turns it into
 

1039
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,270
wolfram does this he turns it into
computation

1040
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:57,280
computation
 

1041
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,430
computation
you don't turn rockets into computation

1042
00:18:59,430 --> 00:18:59,440
you don't turn rockets into computation
 

1043
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,750
you don't turn rockets into computation
yeah by the way when you say computation

1044
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:01,760
yeah by the way when you say computation
 

1045
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,909
yeah by the way when you say computation
in our conversation do you tend to think

1046
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:03,919
in our conversation do you tend to think
 

1047
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,750
in our conversation do you tend to think
of computation narrowly in the way

1048
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:05,760
of computation narrowly in the way
 

1049
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,470
of computation narrowly in the way
touring thought of computation

1050
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:08,480
touring thought of computation
 

1051
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,470
touring thought of computation
it's it's gotten very

1052
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:10,480
it's it's gotten very
 

1053
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,070
it's it's gotten very
okay

1054
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:12,080
okay
 

1055
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,350
okay
you know

1056
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:13,360
you know
 

1057
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,710
you know
squishy yeah squishy okay

1058
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:16,720
squishy yeah squishy okay
 

1059
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,669
squishy yeah squishy okay
um

1060
00:19:17,669 --> 00:19:17,679
um
 

1061
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:18,630
um
but

1062
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:18,640
but
 

1063
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,310
but
computation in the way turing thinks

1064
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:20,320
computation in the way turing thinks
 

1065
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,230
computation in the way turing thinks
about it and the way most people think

1066
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:22,240
about it and the way most people think
 

1067
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,270
about it and the way most people think
about it

1068
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:23,280
about it
 

1069
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,430
about it
actually fits very well with

1070
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:27,440
actually fits very well with
 

1071
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,909
actually fits very well with
thinking like a hunter-gatherer

1072
00:19:29,909 --> 00:19:29,919
thinking like a hunter-gatherer
 

1073
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,150
thinking like a hunter-gatherer
there are places and there can be stuff

1074
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:32,160
there are places and there can be stuff
 

1075
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,070
there are places and there can be stuff
in places and the stuff in places can

1076
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:34,080
in places and the stuff in places can
 

1077
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,990
in places and the stuff in places can
change and it stays there until someone

1078
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:36,000
change and it stays there until someone
 

1079
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,590
change and it stays there until someone
changes it

1080
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:37,600
changes it
 

1081
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,430
changes it
and it's this

1082
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:39,440
and it's this
 

1083
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,390
and it's this
metaphor of place and container which

1084
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:42,400
metaphor of place and container which
 

1085
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,029
metaphor of place and container which
you know is a combination of our

1086
00:19:45,029 --> 00:19:45,039
you know is a combination of our
 

1087
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:48,070
you know is a combination of our
place cells in our hippocampus and uh

1088
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:48,080
place cells in our hippocampus and uh
 

1089
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,190
place cells in our hippocampus and uh
cortex

1090
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:49,200
cortex
 

1091
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,150
cortex
but this is this is how we use metaphors

1092
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:52,160
but this is this is how we use metaphors
 

1093
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,510
but this is this is how we use metaphors
for mostly to think about and when we

1094
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:53,520
for mostly to think about and when we
 

1095
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,150
for mostly to think about and when we
get outside of our metaphor range we

1096
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:56,160
get outside of our metaphor range we
 

1097
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,230
get outside of our metaphor range we
have to invent tools which we can sort

1098
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:58,240
have to invent tools which we can sort
 

1099
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:58,870
have to invent tools which we can sort
of

1100
00:19:58,870 --> 00:19:58,880
of
 

1101
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,190
of
switch on to you so calculus is an

1102
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:01,200
switch on to you so calculus is an
 

1103
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,909
switch on to you so calculus is an
example of a tool it can do stuff that

1104
00:20:03,909 --> 00:20:03,919
example of a tool it can do stuff that
 

1105
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,710
example of a tool it can do stuff that
our raw reasoning can't do and we've got

1106
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:06,720
our raw reasoning can't do and we've got
 

1107
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,549
our raw reasoning can't do and we've got
conventions of when you can use it or

1108
00:20:08,549 --> 00:20:08,559
conventions of when you can use it or
 

1109
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:09,510
conventions of when you can use it or
not

1110
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:09,520
not
 

1111
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,590
not
but sometimes um

1112
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:11,600
but sometimes um
 

1113
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,230
but sometimes um
you know people try to all the time we

1114
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:14,240
you know people try to all the time we
 

1115
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,630
you know people try to all the time we
always try to get physical metaphors for

1116
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:16,640
always try to get physical metaphors for
 

1117
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,870
always try to get physical metaphors for
things which is why

1118
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:18,880
things which is why
 

1119
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,029
things which is why
quantum mechanics has been such a

1120
00:20:21,029 --> 00:20:21,039
quantum mechanics has been such a
 

1121
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:22,710
quantum mechanics has been such a
problem for a hundred years because it's

1122
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:22,720
problem for a hundred years because it's
 

1123
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,390
problem for a hundred years because it's
a particle no it's a wave it's got to be

1124
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:24,400
a particle no it's a wave it's got to be
 

1125
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,310
a particle no it's a wave it's got to be
something we understand and i say no

1126
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:26,320
something we understand and i say no
 

1127
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,070
something we understand and i say no
it's some weird mathematical logic

1128
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:28,080
it's some weird mathematical logic
 

1129
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,310
it's some weird mathematical logic
that's different from those but we want

1130
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:30,320
that's different from those but we want
 

1131
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,669
that's different from those but we want
that metaphor

1132
00:20:31,669 --> 00:20:31,679
that metaphor
 

1133
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,630
that metaphor
well you know i i suspect that that you

1134
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:34,640
well you know i i suspect that that you
 

1135
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,549
well you know i i suspect that that you
know 100 years or 200 years from now

1136
00:20:36,549 --> 00:20:36,559
know 100 years or 200 years from now
 

1137
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,549
know 100 years or 200 years from now
neither quantum mechanics nor nor dark

1138
00:20:38,549 --> 00:20:38,559
neither quantum mechanics nor nor dark
 

1139
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:39,990
neither quantum mechanics nor nor dark
matter will be talked about in the same

1140
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:40,000
matter will be talked about in the same
 

1141
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,350
matter will be talked about in the same
terms you know in the same way that um

1142
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:43,360
terms you know in the same way that um

00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,310
terms you know in the same way that um
lodges theory eventually went away

1144
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:46,320
lodges theory eventually went away
 

1145
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,110
lodges theory eventually went away
because

1146
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:47,120
because
 

1147
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,350
because
it just wasn't an adequate explanatory

1148
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:49,360
it just wasn't an adequate explanatory
 

1149
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,990
it just wasn't an adequate explanatory
metaphor you know that metaphor was the

1150
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:52,000
metaphor you know that metaphor was the
 

1151
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,950
metaphor you know that metaphor was the
stuff

1152
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:52,960
stuff
 

1153
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,190
stuff
there is stuff in

1154
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:55,200
there is stuff in
 

1155
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,750
there is stuff in
the burning the burning is in the matter

1156
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:57,760
the burning the burning is in the matter
 

1157
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,110
the burning the burning is in the matter
because it turns out the burning was

1158
00:20:59,110 --> 00:20:59,120
because it turns out the burning was
 

1159
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,350
because it turns out the burning was
outside the matter it was the oxygen

1160
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:01,360
outside the matter it was the oxygen
 

1161
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,750
outside the matter it was the oxygen
so our desire for metaphor and combined

1162
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:03,760
so our desire for metaphor and combined
 

1163
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,470
so our desire for metaphor and combined
with our limited cognitive capabilities

1164
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:06,480
with our limited cognitive capabilities
 

1165
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,110
with our limited cognitive capabilities
gets us into trouble that's my argument

1166
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:09,120
gets us into trouble that's my argument
 

1167
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,950
gets us into trouble that's my argument
in this book now and people say well

1168
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:10,960
in this book now and people say well
 

1169
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,549
in this book now and people say well
what is it then and i say well i wish i

1170
00:21:12,549 --> 00:21:12,559
what is it then and i say well i wish i
 

1171
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,390
what is it then and i say well i wish i
knew that i tried to talk about that but

1172
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:14,400
knew that i tried to talk about that but
 

1173
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,870
knew that i tried to talk about that but
i you know give some ideas but so so

1174
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:16,880
i you know give some ideas but so so
 

1175
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,190
i you know give some ideas but so so
this is the three things computation is

1176
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:19,200
this is the three things computation is
 

1177
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,590
this is the three things computation is
sort of a particular thing we use

1178
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:21,600
sort of a particular thing we use
 

1179
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,630
sort of a particular thing we use
um

1180
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:22,640
um
 

1181
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,830
um
uh

1182
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:23,840
uh
 

1183
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,990
uh
oh can i tell you one beautiful thing

1184
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:26,000
oh can i tell you one beautiful thing
 

1185
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,350
oh can i tell you one beautiful thing
one yes

1186
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:27,360
one yes
 

1187
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,350
one yes
so you know i used an example of a thing

1188
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:29,360
so you know i used an example of a thing
 

1189
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,190
so you know i used an example of a thing
that's different from computation you

1190
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:31,200
that's different from computation you
 

1191
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,669
that's different from computation you
hit a drum and it vibrates and there are

1192
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:33,679
hit a drum and it vibrates and there are
 

1193
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,070
hit a drum and it vibrates and there are
some some stationary points on the drum

1194
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:36,080
some some stationary points on the drum
 

1195
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,270
some some stationary points on the drum
surface you know because the waves are

1196
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:37,280
surface you know because the waves are
 

1197
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,710
surface you know because the waves are
going up and down the stationary points

1198
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:40,720
going up and down the stationary points
 

1199
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,789
going up and down the stationary points
now

1200
00:21:42,789 --> 00:21:42,799
now
 

1201
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,710
now
you could compute them

1202
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:44,720
you could compute them
 

1203
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,870
you could compute them
to arbitrary position

1204
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:46,880
to arbitrary position
 

1205
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,029
to arbitrary position
um but the drum just knows them the drum

1206
00:21:49,029 --> 00:21:49,039
um but the drum just knows them the drum
 

1207
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,710
um but the drum just knows them the drum
doesn't have to compute

1208
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:50,720
doesn't have to compute
 

1209
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,710
doesn't have to compute
what was the very first computer program

1210
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:52,720
what was the very first computer program
 

1211
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,789
what was the very first computer program
ever written by ada lovelace

1212
00:21:54,789 --> 00:21:54,799
ever written by ada lovelace
 

1213
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,230
ever written by ada lovelace
to compute bernoulli numbers and

1214
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:56,240
to compute bernoulli numbers and
 

1215
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,909
to compute bernoulli numbers and
bernoulli numbers are exactly what you

1216
00:21:57,909 --> 00:21:57,919
bernoulli numbers are exactly what you
 

1217
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:00,149
bernoulli numbers are exactly what you
need to find those stable points in the

1218
00:22:00,149 --> 00:22:00,159
need to find those stable points in the
 

1219
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,950
need to find those stable points in the
drum's surface wow anyway and there was

1220
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:02,960
drum's surface wow anyway and there was
 

1221
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,070
drum's surface wow anyway and there was
a bug in her program

1222
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:06,080

 

1223
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,470

the arguments to divide were reversed in

1224
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:08,480
the arguments to divide were reversed in
 

1225
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,909
the arguments to divide were reversed in
one place

1226
00:22:09,909 --> 00:22:09,919
one place
 

1227
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,070
one place
and it still worked well she never got

1228
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:12,080
and it still worked well she never got
 

1229
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,190
and it still worked well she never got
to run it they never built the

1230
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:13,200
to run it they never built the
 

1231
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,789
to run it they never built the
analytical engine she wrote the program

1232
00:22:14,789 --> 00:22:14,799
analytical engine she wrote the program
 

1233
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:18,470
analytical engine she wrote the program
without without it you know

1234
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:18,480

 

1235
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,909

uh so so computation computation is sort

1236
00:22:21,909 --> 00:22:21,919
uh so so computation computation is sort
 

1237
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,070
uh so so computation computation is sort
of you know a thing that's

1238
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:24,080
of you know a thing that's
 

1239
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,110
of you know a thing that's
become dominant as a metaphor but yeah

1240
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:27,120
become dominant as a metaphor but yeah
 

1241
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,710
become dominant as a metaphor but yeah
is it the right metaphor

1242
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:28,720
is it the right metaphor
 

1243
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,590
is it the right metaphor
um

1244
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:29,600
um
 

1245
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,390
um
all three of these four fields adopted

1246
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:32,400
all three of these four fields adopted
 

1247
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,070
all three of these four fields adopted
computation and

1248
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:34,080
computation and
 

1249
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,190
computation and
you know the

1250
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:35,200
you know the
 

1251
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,710
you know the
a lot of it swirls around warren

1252
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:36,720
a lot of it swirls around warren
 

1253
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,270
a lot of it swirls around warren
mcculloch and his all his students and

1254
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:39,280
mcculloch and his all his students and
 

1255
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,750
mcculloch and his all his students and
he funded a lot of people

1256
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:41,760
he funded a lot of people
 

1257
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,190
he funded a lot of people
um

1258
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:43,200
um
 

1259
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,190
um
and uh

1260
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:45,200
and uh
 

1261
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,870
and uh
and and our human metaphors our

1262
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:46,880
and and our human metaphors our
 

1263
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,870
and and our human metaphors our
limitations to human thinking will play

1264
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:48,880
limitations to human thinking will play
 

1265
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,990
limitations to human thinking will play
into this

1266
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:50,000
into this
 

1267
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,630
into this
the

1268
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:50,640
the
 

1269
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,710
the
three themes of the book

1270
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:52,720
three themes of the book
 

1271
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,230
three themes of the book
so i have a little to say about

1272
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:54,240
so i have a little to say about
 

1273
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,470
so i have a little to say about
computation

1274
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:56,480
computation
 

1275
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,350
computation
so

1276
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:57,360
so
 

1277
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,029
so
uh

1278
00:22:59,029 --> 00:22:59,039
uh
 

1279
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,630
uh
so you're saying that there is a gap

1280
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:00,640
so you're saying that there is a gap
 

1281
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,990
so you're saying that there is a gap
between the computer or the the the

1282
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:04,000
between the computer or the the the
 

1283
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,830
between the computer or the the the
machine that performs computation

1284
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:06,840
machine that performs computation
 

1285
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,909
machine that performs computation
and this machine

1286
00:23:09,909 --> 00:23:09,919
and this machine
 

1287
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:12,149
and this machine
that appears to have consciousness

1288
00:23:12,149 --> 00:23:12,159
that appears to have consciousness
 

1289
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,870
that appears to have consciousness
and intelligence yeah can we um that

1290
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:14,880
and intelligence yeah can we um that
 

1291
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,789
and intelligence yeah can we um that
piece of meat in your head piece of meat

1292
00:23:16,789 --> 00:23:16,799
piece of meat in your head piece of meat
 

1293
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,870
piece of meat in your head piece of meat
and maybe it's not just the meat in your

1294
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:18,880
and maybe it's not just the meat in your
 

1295
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,190
and maybe it's not just the meat in your
head it's the rest of you too i mean you

1296
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:21,200
head it's the rest of you too i mean you
 

1297
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,190
head it's the rest of you too i mean you
have you have you actually have a neural

1298
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:23,200
have you have you actually have a neural
 

1299
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,990
have you have you actually have a neural
system in your gut um i tend to also

1300
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:26,000
system in your gut um i tend to also
 

1301
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,190
system in your gut um i tend to also
believe

1302
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:27,200
believe
 

1303
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,710
believe
not believe but

1304
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:28,720
not believe but
 

1305
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,470
not believe but
we're now dancing around things we don't

1306
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:30,480
we're now dancing around things we don't
 

1307
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,750
we're now dancing around things we don't
know but

1308
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:31,760
know but
 

1309
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,630
know but
i tend to believe other humans are

1310
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:34,640
i tend to believe other humans are
 

1311
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,549
i tend to believe other humans are
important

1312
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:36,559
important
 

1313
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,870
important
like so we're almost like

1314
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:38,880
like so we're almost like
 

1315
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,269
like so we're almost like
i i just don't think we would ever have

1316
00:23:41,269 --> 00:23:41,279
i i just don't think we would ever have
 

1317
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:42,870
i i just don't think we would ever have
achieved the level of intelligence we

1318
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:42,880
achieved the level of intelligence we
 

1319
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,870
achieved the level of intelligence we
have with other humans

1320
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:44,880
have with other humans
 

1321
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,870
have with other humans
i'm not saying so confidently but i have

1322
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:46,880
i'm not saying so confidently but i have
 

1323
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,950
i'm not saying so confidently but i have
an intuition that some of the

1324
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:48,960
an intuition that some of the
 

1325
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,510
an intuition that some of the
intelligence is in the interaction yeah

1326
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:51,520
intelligence is in the interaction yeah
 

1327
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,390
intelligence is in the interaction yeah
and and i think you know i think it it

1328
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:54,400
and and i think you know i think it it
 

1329
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,630
and and i think you know i think it it
seems to be very likely again we you

1330
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:56,640
seems to be very likely again we you
 

1331
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,029
seems to be very likely again we you
know this is speculation but

1332
00:23:59,029 --> 00:23:59,039
know this is speculation but
 

1333
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,830
know this is speculation but
we our species and probably um

1334
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:01,840
we our species and probably um
 

1335
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,830
we our species and probably um
probably in the end those to some extent

1336
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:03,840
probably in the end those to some extent
 

1337
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,470
probably in the end those to some extent
because you can find uh old bones where

1338
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:06,480
because you can find uh old bones where
 

1339
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,470
because you can find uh old bones where
they seem to be counting on them by

1340
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:08,480
they seem to be counting on them by
 

1341
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,830
they seem to be counting on them by
putting notches

1342
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:09,840
putting notches
 

1343
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,789
putting notches
um that when the in the neanderthals are

1344
00:24:12,789 --> 00:24:12,799
um that when the in the neanderthals are
 

1345
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,350
um that when the in the neanderthals are
done we are able to put um

1346
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:15,360
done we are able to put um
 

1347
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,590
done we are able to put um
some of our stuff outside our body into

1348
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:17,600
some of our stuff outside our body into
 

1349
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,430
some of our stuff outside our body into
the world and then other people can

1350
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:19,440
the world and then other people can
 

1351
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,390
the world and then other people can
share it

1352
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:20,400
share it
 

1353
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,310
share it
and then we get these tools that become

1354
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:22,320
and then we get these tools that become
 

1355
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,750
and then we get these tools that become
shared tools and so there's a whole

1356
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:23,760
shared tools and so there's a whole
 

1357
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,190
shared tools and so there's a whole
coupling that

1358
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:25,200
coupling that
 

1359
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,909
coupling that
would not occur in you know

1360
00:24:27,909 --> 00:24:27,919
would not occur in you know
 

1361
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:29,190
would not occur in you know

some other sort of sign by just putting
 

1495
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,149
some other sort of sign by just putting
a couple of marks on them and the deep

1501
00:26:58,159 --> 00:26:59,510

why is it why is it think it's the other

why is it why is it think it's the other
 

1503
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,950
why is it why is it think it's the other
sort of science because redness is not

the grounding problem has been solved no
 

1577
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,470
the grounding problem has been solved no
the labeling problem was solved with

1578
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:16,480
the labeling problem was solved with
 

1579
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,310
the labeling problem was solved with
some percentage accuracy which is

1580
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:18,320
some percentage accuracy which is
 

1581
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,549
some percentage accuracy which is

different from the grounding problem
 

1583
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:22,230
different from the grounding problem
so you uh

1584
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:22,240
so you uh
 

1585
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,549
so you uh
there's uh you agree with hans marvik

1586
00:28:24,549 --> 00:28:24,559
there's uh you agree with hans marvik
 

1587
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:25,590
there's uh you agree with hans marvik
and

1588
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:25,600
and
 

1589
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,990
and
what's called the marvex paradox

1590
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:28,000
what's called the marvex paradox
 

1591
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,549
what's called the marvex paradox
that highlights this counterintuitive

that highlights this counterintuitive
 

1593
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,070
that highlights this counterintuitive
notion that

reasoning
 

1597
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,430
reasoning
is easy

1598
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:35,440
is easy
 

1599
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,190
is easy
but perception

1600
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:37,200
but perception
 

1601
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,430

yeah we shared an office when um when i

1604
00:28:42,789 --> 00:28:42,799
yeah we shared an office when um when i

what was those conversations like they

1610
00:28:48,549 --> 00:28:48,559
what was those conversations like they
 

1611
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:50,230
what was those conversations like they
were great

1612
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:50,240
were great
 

1613
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,470
were great
so do you still kind of maybe you can

1614
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:52,480
so do you still kind of maybe you can
 

1615
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,470
so do you still kind of maybe you can
elaborate and do you still believe this

1616
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:54,480
elaborate and do you still believe this
 

1617
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,149
elaborate and do you still believe this
kind of notion that

1618
00:28:56,149 --> 00:28:56,159
kind of notion that
 

1619
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:00,070
kind of notion that
perception is really uh hard and like

1620
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:00,080
perception is really uh hard and like
 

1621
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,990
perception is really uh hard and like
can you make sense of why we humans have

1622
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:02,000
can you make sense of why we humans have
 

1623
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,070
can you make sense of why we humans have
this poor intuition about what's hard

1624
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:04,080
this poor intuition about what's hard

and you go to the ai lab at mit
 

1639
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:28,230
and you go to the ai lab at mit
um who was it that was doing that was a

1640
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:28,240
um who was it that was doing that was a
 

1641
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,310
um who was it that was doing that was a
bunch of really smart kids who got into

1642
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:30,320
bunch of really smart kids who got into
 

1643
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,430
bunch of really smart kids who got into
mit

1644
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:31,440
mit
 

1645
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,350
mit
and they were intelligent

1646
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:33,360
and they were intelligent
 

1647
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,350
and they were intelligent
so what's intelligence about well the

1648
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:35,360
so what's intelligence about well the
 

1649
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,510
so what's intelligence about well the
stuff they were good at playing chess

1650
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:37,520
stuff they were good at playing chess
 

1651
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,950
stuff they were good at playing chess
doing integrals

1652
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:38,960
doing integrals
 

1653
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,110
doing integrals
that was that was hard stuff

1654
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:41,120
that was that was hard stuff
 

1655
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,430
that was that was hard stuff
yeah but you know a baby could see stuff

1656
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:43,440
yeah but you know a baby could see stuff
 

1657
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,669
yeah but you know a baby could see stuff
that wasn't that wasn't intelligent

1658
00:29:45,669 --> 00:29:45,679
that wasn't that wasn't intelligent
 

1659
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:46,870
that wasn't that wasn't intelligent
anyone could do that that's not

1660
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:46,880
anyone could do that that's not
 

1661
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,070
anyone could do that that's not
intelligence

1662
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:48,080
intelligence
 

1663
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,389
intelligence
and so it you know this there was this

1664
00:29:50,389 --> 00:29:50,399
and so it you know this there was this
 

1665
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:52,870
and so it you know this there was this
intuition that the hard stuff is the

1666
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:52,880
intuition that the hard stuff is the
 

1667
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,789
intuition that the hard stuff is the
things they were good at

1668
00:29:54,789 --> 00:29:54,799
things they were good at
 

1669
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,789
things they were good at
and the easy stuff was the stuff that

1670
00:29:56,789 --> 00:29:56,799
and the easy stuff was the stuff that
 

1671
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:58,230
and the easy stuff was the stuff that
everyone could do

1672
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:58,240
everyone could do
 

1673
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,830
everyone could do
yeah and maybe i'm overplaying it a

1674
00:29:59,830 --> 00:29:59,840
yeah and maybe i'm overplaying it a
 

1675
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,870
yeah and maybe i'm overplaying it a
little bit but i think there's an

1676
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:00,880
little bit but i think there's an
 

1677
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,269
little bit but i think there's an
element of that yeah i mean there

1678
00:30:03,269 --> 00:30:03,279
element of that yeah i mean there
 

1679
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,350
element of that yeah i mean there
i don't know how much truth there is to

1680
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:05,360
i don't know how much truth there is to
 

1681
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,830
i don't know how much truth there is to
uh like chess for

1682
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:06,840
uh like chess for
 

1683
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,350
uh like chess for
example has was for the longest time

1684
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:09,360
example has was for the longest time
 

1685
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,909
example has was for the longest time
seen as the highest um

1686
00:30:11,909 --> 00:30:11,919
seen as the highest um
 

1687
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:13,830
seen as the highest um
level of intellect

1688
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:13,840
level of intellect
 

1689
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,710
level of intellect
right

1690
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:14,720
right
 

1691
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,549
right
until we got computer so we're better at

1692
00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:16,559
until we got computer so we're better at
 

1693
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,230
until we got computer so we're better at
it than people and then

1694
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:18,240
it than people and then
 

1695
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,669
it than people and then
we realized you know if you go back to

1696
00:30:19,669 --> 00:30:19,679
we realized you know if you go back to
 

1697
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:21,510
we realized you know if you go back to
the 90s you'll see you know the stories

1698
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:21,520
the 90s you'll see you know the stories
 

1699
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,990
the 90s you'll see you know the stories
in the press around when when

1700
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:24,000
in the press around when when
 

1701
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,710
in the press around when when
kasparov was beaten by deep blue oh this

1702
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:26,720
kasparov was beaten by deep blue oh this
 

1703
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,389
kasparov was beaten by deep blue oh this
is the end of all sorts of things

1704
00:30:28,389 --> 00:30:28,399
is the end of all sorts of things
 

1705
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:29,430
is the end of all sorts of things
computers are going to be able to do

1706
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:29,440
computers are going to be able to do
 

1707
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,590
computers are going to be able to do
anything from now on and we saw exactly

1708
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:31,600
anything from now on and we saw exactly
 

1709
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,990
anything from now on and we saw exactly
the same stories with alpha zero the

1710
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:34,000
the same stories with alpha zero the
 

1711
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,269
the same stories with alpha zero the
go playing program yeah

1712
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:37,279
go playing program yeah
 

1713
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:39,029
go playing program yeah
but still to me

1714
00:30:39,029 --> 00:30:39,039
but still to me
 

1715
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:41,190
but still to me
reasoning is a special thing

1716
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:41,200
reasoning is a special thing
 

1717
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,190
reasoning is a special thing
and perhaps no way we actually we're

1718
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:43,200
and perhaps no way we actually we're
 

1719
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,110
and perhaps no way we actually we're
really bad at reasoning we just use

1720
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:45,120
really bad at reasoning we just use
 

1721
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,950
really bad at reasoning we just use
these analogies based on our how to

1722
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:46,960
these analogies based on our how to
 

1723
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,750
these analogies based on our how to
gather intuitions but why is that not

1724
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:49,760
gather intuitions but why is that not
 

1725
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,350
gather intuitions but why is that not
don't you think the ability to construct

1726
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:51,360
don't you think the ability to construct
 

1727
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,149
don't you think the ability to construct
metaphor is a really powerful thing oh

1728
00:30:54,149 --> 00:30:54,159
metaphor is a really powerful thing oh
 

1729
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:56,389
metaphor is a really powerful thing oh
yeah it is stories it is that's it's the

1730
00:30:56,389 --> 00:30:56,399
yeah it is stories it is that's it's the
 

1731
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:57,909
yeah it is stories it is that's it's the
constructing the metaphor and

1732
00:30:57,909 --> 00:30:57,919
constructing the metaphor and
 

1733
00:30:57,919 --> 00:30:59,430
constructing the metaphor and
registering that yeah something

1734
00:30:59,430 --> 00:30:59,440
registering that yeah something
 

1735
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,269
registering that yeah something
complicated

1736
00:31:01,269 --> 00:31:01,279
complicated
 

1737
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:02,950
complicated
is not what we're doing with

1738
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:02,960
is not what we're doing with
 

1739
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,789
is not what we're doing with
with vision too and

1740
00:31:04,789 --> 00:31:04,799
with vision too and
 

1741
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,230
with vision too and
we're telling our stories we're

1742
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:06,240
we're telling our stories we're
 

1743
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,549
we're telling our stories we're
constructing good models of the world

1744
00:31:08,549 --> 00:31:08,559
constructing good models of the world
 

1745
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:11,669
constructing good models of the world
yeah yeah but but um

1746
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:11,679
yeah yeah but but um
 

1747
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:13,990
yeah yeah but but um
i think we we jumped between what we're

1748
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:14,000
i think we we jumped between what we're
 

1749
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,149
i think we we jumped between what we're
capable of and how we're doing it right

1750
00:31:16,149 --> 00:31:16,159
capable of and how we're doing it right
 

1751
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:17,590
capable of and how we're doing it right
there there was a little confusion that

1752
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:17,600
there there was a little confusion that
 

1753
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,350
there there was a little confusion that
went on um

1754
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:19,360
went on um
 

1755
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,669
went on um
uh as we were telling each other stories

1756
00:31:21,669 --> 00:31:21,679
uh as we were telling each other stories
 

1757
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,509
uh as we were telling each other stories
yes exactly

1758
00:31:23,509 --> 00:31:23,519
yes exactly
 

1759
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:25,590
yes exactly
trying to dilute each other no i i just

1760
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:25,600
trying to dilute each other no i i just
 

1761
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,509
trying to dilute each other no i i just
think uh i'm not exactly so i'm trying

1762
00:31:27,509 --> 00:31:27,519
think uh i'm not exactly so i'm trying
 

1763
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:30,149
think uh i'm not exactly so i'm trying
to pull apart this marvex paradox

1764
00:31:30,149 --> 00:31:30,159
to pull apart this marvex paradox
 

1765
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:33,269
to pull apart this marvex paradox
i don't view it as a paradox

1766
00:31:33,269 --> 00:31:33,279
i don't view it as a paradox
 

1767
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:34,950
i don't view it as a paradox
what did evolution what did evolution

1768
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:34,960
what did evolution what did evolution
 

1769
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,029
what did evolution what did evolution
spend its time on yes it spent its time

1770
00:31:37,029 --> 00:31:37,039
spend its time on yes it spent its time
 

1771
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:38,549
spend its time on yes it spent its time
on getting us to perceive and move in

1772
00:31:38,549 --> 00:31:38,559
on getting us to perceive and move in
 

1773
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:41,029
on getting us to perceive and move in
the world that was you know 600 million

1774
00:31:41,029 --> 00:31:41,039
the world that was you know 600 million
 

1775
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:43,590
the world that was you know 600 million
years as multi-cell creatures doing that

1776
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:43,600
years as multi-cell creatures doing that
 

1777
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,509
years as multi-cell creatures doing that
and then it was you know relatively

1778
00:31:45,509 --> 00:31:45,519
and then it was you know relatively
 

1779
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:47,269
and then it was you know relatively
recent that we that we you know were

1780
00:31:47,269 --> 00:31:47,279
recent that we that we you know were
 

1781
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:48,310
recent that we that we you know were
able to

1782
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:48,320
able to
 

1783
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,430
able to
um hunt or or gather or you know even

1784
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:51,440
um hunt or or gather or you know even
 

1785
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,149
um hunt or or gather or you know even
even animals hunting that's much more

1786
00:31:54,149 --> 00:31:54,159
even animals hunting that's much more
 

1787
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:56,710
even animals hunting that's much more
recent and then and then anything that

00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:56,720
recent and then and then anything that
 

1789
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:00,630

we you know speech uh language those
 

1791
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,630
we you know speech uh language those
things are you know a couple of hundred

00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:02,640
things are you know a couple of hundred
 

1793
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,190

00:32:08,389 --> 00:32:08,399
long and then agriculture 10 000 years
 

1797
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:09,509
long and then agriculture 10 000 years
you know

1798
00:32:09,509 --> 00:32:09,519
you know
 

1799
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:11,509
you know
all that stuff was built on top of those

1800
00:32:11,509 --> 00:32:11,519
all that stuff was built on top of those
 

1801
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:13,269
all that stuff was built on top of those
earlier things which took a long time to

1802
00:32:13,269 --> 00:32:13,279
earlier things which took a long time to
 

1803
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:15,830
earlier things which took a long time to
develop so if you then look at the

1804
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:15,840
develop so if you then look at the
 

1805
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,389
develop so if you then look at the
engineering of these things so

1806
00:32:18,389 --> 00:32:18,399
engineering of these things so
 

1807
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:21,909
engineering of these things so
building it into robots

1808
00:32:21,909 --> 00:32:21,919
building it into robots
 

1809
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:23,830
building it into robots
what's the hardest part of robotics do

1810
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:23,840
what's the hardest part of robotics do
 

1811
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,789
what's the hardest part of robotics do
you think

1812
00:32:24,789 --> 00:32:24,799
you think
 

1813
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:26,630
you think
as uh through the decades that you

1814
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:26,640
as uh through the decades that you
 

1815
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,310
as uh through the decades that you
worked on robots

1816
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:30,320

 

1817
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,750

in the context of what we're talking

1818
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:31,760
in the context of what we're talking
 

1819
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,230
in the context of what we're talking
about vision you know perception

1820
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:34,240
about vision you know perception
 

1821
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,230
about vision you know perception
the actual sort of the

1822
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:36,240
the actual sort of the
 

1823
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,870
the actual sort of the
the biomechanics of movement

1824
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:38,880
the biomechanics of movement
 

1825
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,230
the biomechanics of movement
i'm kind of drawing parallels here

1826
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:40,240
i'm kind of drawing parallels here
 

1827
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,549
i'm kind of drawing parallels here
between humans and machines always like

1828
00:32:42,549 --> 00:32:42,559
between humans and machines always like
 

1829
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:44,230
between humans and machines always like
uh what do you think is the hardest part

1830
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:44,240
uh what do you think is the hardest part
 

1831
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,909
uh what do you think is the hardest part
of robotics

1832
00:32:45,909 --> 00:32:45,919
of robotics
 

1833
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:49,350
of robotics
i sort of think all of them

1834
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:49,360
i sort of think all of them
 

1835
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,710
i sort of think all of them
there are no easy parts to do well um

1836
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:52,720
there are no easy parts to do well um
 

1837
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,630
there are no easy parts to do well um
we we sort of go reductionist and we

1838
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:54,640
we we sort of go reductionist and we
 

1839
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,269
we we sort of go reductionist and we
reduce it to if only we had all the

1840
00:32:57,269 --> 00:32:57,279
reduce it to if only we had all the
 

1841
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:59,509
reduce it to if only we had all the
location of all the points in 3d yeah

1842
00:32:59,509 --> 00:32:59,519
location of all the points in 3d yeah
 

1843
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,149
location of all the points in 3d yeah
things would be great

1844
00:33:02,149 --> 00:33:02,159
things would be great
 

1845
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,470
things would be great
you know if only we had labels on the on

1846
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:04,480
you know if only we had labels on the on
 

1847
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,230
you know if only we had labels on the on
the images you know

1848
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:06,240
the images you know
 

1849
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,870
the images you know
things would be great but you know as as

1850
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:08,880
things would be great but you know as as
 

1851
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,710
things would be great but you know as as
we see that's not good enough

1852
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:10,720
we see that's not good enough
 

1853
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,470
we see that's not good enough
some deeper

1854
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:12,480
some deeper
 

1855
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,389
some deeper
understanding but if you if i came to

1856
00:33:14,389 --> 00:33:14,399
understanding but if you if i came to
 

1857
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:16,630
understanding but if you if i came to
you and i could solve

1858
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:16,640
you and i could solve
 

1859
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,070
you and i could solve
one category of problems in robotics

1860
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:20,080
one category of problems in robotics
 

1861
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,669
one category of problems in robotics
uh instantly

1862
00:33:21,669 --> 00:33:21,679
uh instantly
 

1863
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:23,590
uh instantly
what would give you uh the greatest

1864
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:23,600
what would give you uh the greatest
 

1865
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,470
what would give you uh the greatest
pleasure

1866
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:24,480
pleasure
 

1867
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,230
pleasure
[Laughter]

1868
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:28,240
[Laughter]
 

1869
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,630
[Laughter]
i mean is it uh

1870
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:30,640
i mean is it uh
 

1871
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,549
i mean is it uh
you know you you look at robots that

1872
00:33:32,549 --> 00:33:32,559
you know you you look at robots that
 

1873
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:34,630
you know you you look at robots that
manipulate objects

1874
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:34,640
manipulate objects
 

1875
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,430
manipulate objects
uh

1876
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:35,440
uh
 

1877
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,029
uh
what's hard about that

1878
00:33:37,029 --> 00:33:37,039
what's hard about that
 

1879
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:39,830
what's hard about that
you know is it uh the perception

1880
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:39,840
you know is it uh the perception
 

1881
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,630
you know is it uh the perception
is it the uh the reasoning about the

1882
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:42,640
is it the uh the reasoning about the
 

1883
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,269
is it the uh the reasoning about the
world like common sense reasoning

1884
00:33:45,269 --> 00:33:45,279
world like common sense reasoning
 

1885
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:46,870
world like common sense reasoning
is it the actual

1886
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:46,880
is it the actual
 

1887
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,630
is it the actual
building a robot that's able to interact

1888
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:48,640
building a robot that's able to interact
 

1889
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,549
building a robot that's able to interact
with the world

1890
00:33:50,549 --> 00:33:50,559
with the world
 

1891
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:52,870
with the world
is it like human aspects of a robot

1892
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:52,880
is it like human aspects of a robot
 

1893
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,630
is it like human aspects of a robot
that's interacting with humans and that

1894
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:54,640
that's interacting with humans and that
 

1895
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,470
that's interacting with humans and that
that game theory of how they work well

1896
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:56,480
that game theory of how they work well
 

1897
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,350
that game theory of how they work well
together well let's talk about

1898
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:57,360
together well let's talk about
 

1899
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,029
together well let's talk about
manipulation for a second because i had

1900
00:33:59,029 --> 00:33:59,039
manipulation for a second because i had
 

1901
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:01,029
manipulation for a second because i had
this really blinding

1902
00:34:01,029 --> 00:34:01,039
this really blinding
 

1903
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,149
this really blinding
moment

1904
00:34:02,149 --> 00:34:02,159
moment
 

1905
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:04,470
moment
uh uh you know i'm a grandfather so

1906
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:04,480
uh uh you know i'm a grandfather so
 

1907
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,630
uh uh you know i'm a grandfather so
grandfather's had blinding moments yes

1908
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:06,640
grandfather's had blinding moments yes
 

1909
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,669
grandfather's had blinding moments yes
just a

1910
00:34:07,669 --> 00:34:07,679
just a

00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,470
just a
three or four miles from here

1912
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:10,480
three or four miles from here
 

1913
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,389
three or four miles from here
last year my

1914
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:12,399
last year my
 

1915
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:15,430
last year my
16 month old grandson was in his new

1916
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:15,440
16 month old grandson was in his new
 

1917
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,230
16 month old grandson was in his new
house first time right

1918
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:18,240
house first time right
 

1919
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,270
house first time right
first time in this house and he'd never

1920
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:21,280
first time in this house and he'd never
 

1921
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,349
first time in this house and he'd never
been able to get to a window before but

1922
00:34:23,349 --> 00:34:23,359
been able to get to a window before but
 

1923
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:25,829
been able to get to a window before but
this had some low windows and he goes up

1924
00:34:25,829 --> 00:34:25,839
this had some low windows and he goes up
 

1925
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:27,829
this had some low windows and he goes up
to this window with a handle on it that

1926
00:34:27,829 --> 00:34:27,839
to this window with a handle on it that
 

1927
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:30,389
to this window with a handle on it that
he's never seen before and he's got one

1928
00:34:30,389 --> 00:34:30,399
he's never seen before and he's got one
 

1929
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:32,869
he's never seen before and he's got one
hand pushing the window and the other

1930
00:34:32,869 --> 00:34:32,879
hand pushing the window and the other
 

1931
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:34,950
hand pushing the window and the other
hand turning the handle to open the

1932
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:34,960
hand turning the handle to open the
 

1933
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,950
hand turning the handle to open the
window

1934
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:36,960
window
 

1935
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,990
window
he he knew he two different hands

1936
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:40,000
he he knew he two different hands
 

1937
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,149
he he knew he two different hands
two different things he knew how to how

1938
00:34:42,149 --> 00:34:42,159
two different things he knew how to how
 

1939
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:44,149
two different things he knew how to how
to put together yeah

1940
00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:44,159
to put together yeah
 

1941
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,230
to put together yeah
and he's 16 months old and there you are

1942
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:46,240
and he's 16 months old and there you are
 

1943
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:51,909
and he's 16 months old and there you are
watching an awesome

1944
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:51,919

 

1945
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:53,750

in an environment environment he'd never

1946
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:53,760
in an environment environment he'd never
 

1947
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,389
in an environment environment he'd never
seen before mechanism how did he do that

1948
00:34:56,389 --> 00:34:56,399
seen before mechanism how did he do that
 

1949
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:58,310
seen before mechanism how did he do that
yes that's a good question how did he do

1950
00:34:58,310 --> 00:34:58,320
yes that's a good question how did he do
 

1951
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,710
yes that's a good question how did he do
that that's why

1952
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:00,720
that that's why
 

1953
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,870
that that's why
it's like okay like you could see the

1954
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:02,880
it's like okay like you could see the
 

1955
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,030
it's like okay like you could see the
the leap of genius from using one hand

1956
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:05,040
the leap of genius from using one hand
 

1957
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,390
the leap of genius from using one hand

doing i mean first of all in

1960
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:09,760
doing i mean first of all in
 

1961
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,430
doing i mean first of all in
manipulation that's really difficult

1962
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:11,440
manipulation that's really difficult
 

1963
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,190
manipulation that's really difficult
it's like two hands

1964
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:13,200
it's like two hands
 

1965
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,910
it's like two hands
both necessary to complete the action

1966
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:15,920
both necessary to complete the action
 

1967
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,349
both necessary to complete the action
and completely different and he'd never

1968
00:35:17,349 --> 00:35:17,359
and completely different and he'd never
 

1969
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:21,829
and completely different and he'd never
seen a window open before

1970
00:35:21,829 --> 00:35:21,839

 

1971
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:24,470

but in third somehow handle opened

1972
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:24,480
but in third somehow handle opened
 

1973
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,710
but in third somehow handle opened
something yeah there may have been a lot

1974
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:26,720
something yeah there may have been a lot
 

1975
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,630
something yeah there may have been a lot
of

1976
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:28,640
of
 

1977
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,390
of
slightly different failure cases that

1978
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:30,400
slightly different failure cases that
 

1979
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,750
slightly different failure cases that
you didn't see

1980
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:31,760
you didn't see
 

1981
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,510
you didn't see
yeah not with a window but with other

1982
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:33,520
yeah not with a window but with other
 

1983
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,589
yeah not with a window but with other

um you know
 

1993
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:43,030
um you know
reinforced reinforcement learning will

1994
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:43,040
reinforced reinforcement learning will
 

1995
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,230
reinforced reinforcement learning will
just give you know the robot um

1996
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:46,240
just give you know the robot um
 

1997
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,069
just give you know the robot um
or you give the robot plenty of time to

1998
00:35:48,069 --> 00:35:48,079
or you give the robot plenty of time to
 

1999
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,230
or you give the robot plenty of time to
try everything yes actually

2000
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:50,240
try everything yes actually
 

2001
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,349
try everything yes actually
can i tell a little side story here

2002
00:35:53,349 --> 00:35:53,359
can i tell a little side story here
 

2003
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,109
can i tell a little side story here
so i'm in um

2004
00:35:55,109 --> 00:35:55,119
so i'm in um
 

2005
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,670
so i'm in um
deep mind in london

2006
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:57,680
deep mind in london
 

2007
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,470
deep mind in london
is

2008
00:35:58,470 --> 00:35:58,480
is
 

2009
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,630
is
three four years ago where

2010
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:00,640
three four years ago where
 

2011
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,310
three four years ago where
um you know there's a big google

2012
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:02,320
um you know there's a big google
 

2013
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,270
um you know there's a big google
building

2014
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:03,280
building
 

2015
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,630
building
and then you go inside and you go

2016
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:04,640
and then you go inside and you go
 

2017
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,990
and then you go inside and you go
through there's more security and then

2018
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:06,000
through there's more security and then
 

2019
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,349
through there's more security and then
you get to deep mind where the other

2020
00:36:07,349 --> 00:36:07,359
you get to deep mind where the other
 

2021
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:09,349
you get to deep mind where the other
google employees can't go yeah and i'm

2022
00:36:09,349 --> 00:36:09,359
google employees can't go yeah and i'm
 

2023
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:10,710
google employees can't go yeah and i'm
in a

00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,390
in a
i'm in a conference room bayer

2026
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:12,400
i'm in a conference room bayer
 

2027
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,310
i'm in a conference room bayer
conference room with some of the people

00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:14,320
conference room with some of the people
 

2029
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,030

and
 

2031
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,109
and
they tell me about their reinforcement

2032
00:36:17,109 --> 00:36:17,119
they tell me about their reinforcement
 

2033
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:20,390
they tell me about their reinforcement
learning experiment with uh robots um

2034
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:20,400
learning experiment with uh robots um
 

2035
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,310
learning experiment with uh robots um
um which um

2036
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:22,320
um which um
 

2037
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,470
um which um
are just trying stuff out and they're my

2038
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:24,480
are just trying stuff out and they're my
 

2039
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,109
are just trying stuff out and they're my
robots they're they're sawyers that we

2040
00:36:27,109 --> 00:36:27,119
robots they're they're sawyers that we
 

2041
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:28,870
robots they're they're sawyers that we
sold them um

2042
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:28,880
sold them um
 

2043
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,230
sold them um
uh and they really like them because

2044
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:30,240
uh and they really like them because
 

2045
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,630
uh and they really like them because
sawyers are compliant and can sense

2046
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:32,640
sawyers are compliant and can sense
 

2047
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,550
sawyers are compliant and can sense
forces so they don't break when it's

2048
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:34,560
forces so they don't break when it's
 

2049
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,950
forces so they don't break when it's
bashing into walls they they stop and

2050
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:36,960
bashing into walls they they stop and
 

2051
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,470
bashing into walls they they stop and
they do stuff

2052
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:38,480
they do stuff
 

2053
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,230
they do stuff
and you know so you just let the robot

2054
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:40,240
and you know so you just let the robot
 

2055
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,310
and you know so you just let the robot
do stuff and eventually it figures stuff

2056
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:42,320
do stuff and eventually it figures stuff
 

2057
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,910
do stuff and eventually it figures stuff
out by the way so

2058
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:43,920
out by the way so
 

2059
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,430
out by the way so
we're talking about robot manipulation

2060
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:45,440
we're talking about robot manipulation
 

2061
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,230
we're talking about robot manipulation
so robot arms and so on yeah so he's a

2062
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:48,240
so robot arms and so on yeah so he's a
 

2063
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,190
so robot arms and so on yeah so he's a
robot yeah um just to go what's sawyer

2064
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:51,200
robot yeah um just to go what's sawyer
 

2065
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,670
robot yeah um just to go what's sawyer
so here's a robot arm that my company

2066
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:53,680
so here's a robot arm that my company
 

2067
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,430
so here's a robot arm that my company
rethink robotics yeah built thank you

2068
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:55,440
rethink robotics yeah built thank you
 

2069
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,630
rethink robotics yeah built thank you
for the context

2070
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:56,640
for the context
 

2071
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,349
for the context
sorry okay cool so we're indeed mine

2072
00:36:59,349 --> 00:36:59,359
sorry okay cool so we're indeed mine
 

2073
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:00,950
sorry okay cool so we're indeed mine
and the you know it's in the next room

2074
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:00,960
and the you know it's in the next room
 

2075
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,710
and the you know it's in the next room
these robots are just bashing around to

2076
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:02,720
these robots are just bashing around to
 

2077
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,550
these robots are just bashing around to
try and use reinforcement learning to

2078
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:04,560
try and use reinforcement learning to
 

2079
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,790
try and use reinforcement learning to
learn how to act and can i go see them

2080
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:06,800
learn how to act and can i go see them
 

2081
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,790
learn how to act and can i go see them
oh no they're secret they're all my

2082
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:08,800
oh no they're secret they're all my
 

2083
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,790
oh no they're secret they're all my
robots they're a secret

2084
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:10,800
robots they're a secret
 

2085
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,109
robots they're a secret
that's hilarious okay anyway the point

2086
00:37:13,109 --> 00:37:13,119
that's hilarious okay anyway the point
 

2087
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:16,069
that's hilarious okay anyway the point
is you know this idea that you just let

2088
00:37:16,069 --> 00:37:16,079
is you know this idea that you just let
 

2089
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:17,910
is you know this idea that you just let
uh reinforcement learning figure

2090
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:17,920
uh reinforcement learning figure
 

2091
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,230
uh reinforcement learning figure
everything out is so counter to how a

2092
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:20,240
everything out is so counter to how a
 

2093
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,670
everything out is so counter to how a
kid does stuff

2094
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:21,680
kid does stuff
 

2095
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,870
kid does stuff
so

2096
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:22,880
so
 

2097
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,190
so
again story about my grandson i gave him

2098
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:25,200
again story about my grandson i gave him
 

2099
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,030
again story about my grandson i gave him
this this uh

2100
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:27,040
this this uh
 

2101
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,630
this this uh
box that had lots of different lock

2102
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:28,640
box that had lots of different lock
 

2103
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,950
box that had lots of different lock
mechanisms he didn't randomly you know

2104
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:30,960
mechanisms he didn't randomly you know
 

2105
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,790
mechanisms he didn't randomly you know
when he was 18 months old he didn't

2106
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:32,800
when he was 18 months old he didn't
 

2107
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,950
when he was 18 months old he didn't
randomly try to touch every surface or

2108
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:34,960
randomly try to touch every surface or
 

2109
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,670
randomly try to touch every surface or
push everything he found he could see

2110
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:37,680
push everything he found he could see
 

2111
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,910
push everything he found he could see
what where the mechanism was and he

2112
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:39,920
what where the mechanism was and he
 

2113
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,390
what where the mechanism was and he
started exploring the mechanism for each

2114
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:42,400
started exploring the mechanism for each
 

2115
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,550
started exploring the mechanism for each
of these different lock mechanisms

2116
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:44,560
of these different lock mechanisms
 

2117
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,950
of these different lock mechanisms
and there was reinforcement no doubt of

2118
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:46,960

00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,230
and there was reinforcement no doubt of
some sort going on there but he applied

2120
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:50,240
some sort going on there but he applied
 

2121
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,630
some sort going on there but he applied
a pre-filter which cut down the search

2122
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:52,640
a pre-filter which cut down the search
 

2123
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,550
a pre-filter which cut down the search
space dramatically

2124
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:54,560

i i

2126
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:55,520
i i
 

2127
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,670
i i
i wonder to what level we're able to

2128
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:57,680
i wonder to what level we're able to
 

2129
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,670
i wonder to what level we're able to
introspect what's going on

2130
00:37:59,670 --> 00:37:59,680
introspect what's going on
 

2131
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,349
introspect what's going on
because what's also possible is you have

2132
00:38:01,349 --> 00:38:01,359
because what's also possible is you have
 

2133
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:03,430
because what's also possible is you have
something like reinforcement learning

2134
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:03,440
something like reinforcement learning
 

2135
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,109
something like reinforcement learning
going on in the mind in the space of

2136
00:38:05,109 --> 00:38:05,119
going on in the mind in the space of
 

2137
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:06,950
going on in the mind in the space of
imagination so like you have a good

2138
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:06,960
imagination so like you have a good
 

2139
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,270
imagination so like you have a good
model of the world you're predicting and

2140
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:09,280
model of the world you're predicting and
 

2141
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,349
model of the world you're predicting and
you may be running those tens of

2142
00:38:11,349 --> 00:38:11,359
you may be running those tens of
 

2143
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:12,790
you may be running those tens of
thousands of like

2144
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:12,800
thousands of like
 

2145
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,750
thousands of like
loops but you're like as a human you're

2146
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:15,760
loops but you're like as a human you're
 

2147
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,349
loops but you're like as a human you're
just looking at yourself trying to tell

2148
00:38:17,349 --> 00:38:17,359
just looking at yourself trying to tell
 

2149
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:19,589
just looking at yourself trying to tell
a story of what happened and it might

2150
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:19,599
a story of what happened and it might
 

2151
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:22,710
a story of what happened and it might
seem simple but maybe there's a lot of

2152
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:22,720
seem simple but maybe there's a lot of
 

2153
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,550
seem simple but maybe there's a lot of
computation going on

2154
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:24,560
computation going on
 

2155
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,390
computation going on
whatever it is but there's also a

2156
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:26,400
whatever it is but there's also a
 

2157
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,630
whatever it is but there's also a
mechanism that's being built up it's not

2158
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:28,640
mechanism that's being built up it's not
 

2159
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,510
mechanism that's being built up it's not
just

2160
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:29,520
just
 

2161
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,750
just
random search

2162
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:31,760
random search
 

2163
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,589
random search
mechanism prunes it

2164
00:38:33,589 --> 00:38:33,599
mechanism prunes it
 

2165
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:37,109
mechanism prunes it
dramatically yeah that that pruning

2166
00:38:37,109 --> 00:38:37,119
dramatically yeah that that pruning
 

2167
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:39,990
dramatically yeah that that pruning
uh that pruning stuff but it doesn't

2168
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:40,000
uh that pruning stuff but it doesn't
 

2169
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,750
uh that pruning stuff but it doesn't
it's possible that that's

2170
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:41,760
it's possible that that's
 

2171
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,910
it's possible that that's
so you don't think that's akin to a

2172
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:43,920
so you don't think that's akin to a
 

2173
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,510
so you don't think that's akin to a
neural network inside of reinforcement

2174
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:45,520
neural network inside of reinforcement

is it possible

00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:50,000
is it possible
 

2179
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:50,790
is it possible
it's

2180
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:50,800
it's
 

2181
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,470
it's
yeah until it's possible i uh but but i

2182
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:54,480
yeah until it's possible i uh but but i
 

2183
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,270
yeah until it's possible i uh but but i
you know

00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:55,280
you know
 

2185
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,190
you know
um

00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:57,910
um
i

i i'll be incredibly surprised if that

i i'll be incredibly surprised if that
 

2191
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,390
i i'll be incredibly surprised if that
happens i'll also be incredibly

2192
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:02,400
happens i'll also be incredibly
 

2193
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,630
happens i'll also be incredibly
surprised that you know after all the

surprised that you know after all the
 

2195
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,230

00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:08,800
every every few years someone thinks now
 

2199
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,069
every every few years someone thinks now
we've got it

2200
00:39:10,069 --> 00:39:10,079
we've got it
 

2201
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:11,589
we've got it
now we've got it

2202
00:39:11,589 --> 00:39:11,599
now we've got it
 

2203
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:12,630
now we've got it
you know

2204
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:12,640
you know
 

2205
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,630
you know
four or five years ago i was saying i

2206
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:14,640
four or five years ago i was saying i
 

2207
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,750
four or five years ago i was saying i
don't think we've got it yet and

2208
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:15,760
don't think we've got it yet and
 

2209
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,710
don't think we've got it yet and
everyone was saying no you don't

2210
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:16,720
everyone was saying no you don't
 

2211
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,349
everyone was saying no you don't
understand how powerful hey i had people

2212
00:39:19,349 --> 00:39:19,359
understand how powerful hey i had people
 

2213
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:20,470
understand how powerful hey i had people
tell me you don't understand how

2214
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:20,480
tell me you don't understand how
 

2215
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,829
tell me you don't understand how
powerful it is

2216
00:39:21,829 --> 00:39:21,839
powerful it is
 

2217
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:26,390
powerful it is
um i you know i i i sort of had a a

2218
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:26,400
um i you know i i i sort of had a a
 

2219
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,390
um i you know i i i sort of had a a
a track record of what the world had

2220
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:28,400
a track record of what the world had
 

2221
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,470
a track record of what the world had
done to think well this is no different

00:39:33,109 --> 00:39:33,119
from before oh we have bigger computers
 

2225
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:34,710
from before oh we have bigger computers
we had bigger computers in the 90s and

2226
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:34,720
we had bigger computers in the 90s and
 

2227
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,990
we had bigger computers in the 90s and
we could do more ship stuff

2228
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:38,000
we could do more ship stuff
 

2229
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,990
we could do more ship stuff
but okay so let me let me let me push

2230
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:40,000
but okay so let me let me let me push
 

2231
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,910
but okay so let me let me let me push
back because i i'm i'm generally sort of

uh big leap but is there something
 

2257
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,710
uh big leap but is there something

vision for robots what about alpha zero

2280
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:36,800
vision for robots what about alpha zero
 

2281
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,150
vision for robots what about alpha zero
and self-play mechanisms and

2282
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:38,160
and self-play mechanisms and
 

2283
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,670
and self-play mechanisms and
reinforcement learning isn't that yeah

2284
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:39,680
reinforcement learning isn't that yeah
 

2285
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,390
reinforcement learning isn't that yeah
that was all in in donald mickey's 1961

2286
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:42,400
that was all in in donald mickey's 1961
 

2287
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,069
that was all in in donald mickey's 1961
paper um

2288
00:40:44,069 --> 00:40:44,079
paper um
 

2289
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:46,069
paper um
everything that was there which

2290
00:40:46,069 --> 00:40:46,079
everything that was there which
 

2291
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:48,550
everything that was there which
introduced reinforcement learning um no

2292
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:48,560
introduced reinforcement learning um no
 

2293
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,470
introduced reinforcement learning um no
but come on so no you're talking about

2294
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:50,480
but come on so no you're talking about
 

2295
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,630
but come on so no you're talking about
the actual techniques but isn't it

2296
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:52,640
the actual techniques but isn't it
 

2297
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,349
the actual techniques but isn't it
surprising to you the level it's able to

2298
00:40:55,349 --> 00:40:55,359
surprising to you the level it's able to
 

2299
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:58,710
surprising to you the level it's able to
achieve with no human supervision

2300
00:40:58,710 --> 00:40:58,720
achieve with no human supervision
 

2301
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:02,069
achieve with no human supervision
of chess play like

2302
00:41:02,069 --> 00:41:02,079

 

2303
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:04,870

to me there's a big big difference maybe

2304
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:04,880
to me there's a big big difference maybe
 

2305
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,550
to me there's a big big difference maybe
blue and maybe what that's saying

2306
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:08,560
blue and maybe what that's saying
 

2307
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,670
blue and maybe what that's saying
is how overblown our view of ourselves

2308
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:11,680
is how overblown our view of ourselves
 

2309
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,109
is how overblown our view of ourselves
is

2310
00:41:13,109 --> 00:41:13,119
is
 

2311
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:16,710
is
you know we that chest is easy

2312
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:16,720
you know we that chest is easy
 

2313
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:20,150
you know we that chest is easy
yeah i mean i i

2314
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:20,160
yeah i mean i i
 

2315
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:23,069
yeah i mean i i
i came across this

2316
00:41:23,069 --> 00:41:23,079
i came across this
 

2317
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:25,670
i came across this
1946 report

2318
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:25,680
1946 report
 

2319
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,069
1946 report
that um and i'd seen this as a kid in

2320
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:28,079
that um and i'd seen this as a kid in
 

2321
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:29,510
that um and i'd seen this as a kid in
one of those books that my mother had

2322
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:29,520
one of those books that my mother had
 

2323
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,870
one of those books that my mother had
given me actually

2324
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:30,880
given me actually
 

2325
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:35,750
given me actually
um 1946 report which pitted uh

2326
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:35,760
um 1946 report which pitted uh
 

2327
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,670
um 1946 report which pitted uh
someone with an abacus against an

2328
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:37,680
someone with an abacus against an
 

2329
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,670
someone with an abacus against an
electronic calculator

2330
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:39,680
electronic calculator
 

2331
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,550
electronic calculator
and he beat the electronic calculator

2332
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:42,560
and he beat the electronic calculator
 

2333
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:45,510
and he beat the electronic calculator
you know so there at that point was well

2334
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:45,520
you know so there at that point was well
 

2335
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,349
you know so there at that point was well
humans are still better than

2336
00:41:47,349 --> 00:41:47,359
humans are still better than
 

2337
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:49,349
humans are still better than
machines are calculating are you

2338
00:41:49,349 --> 00:41:49,359
machines are calculating are you
 

2339
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:52,150
machines are calculating are you
surprised today that a machine can you

2340
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:52,160
surprised today that a machine can you
 

2341
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,750
surprised today that a machine can you
know do a billion floating point

2342
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:53,760
know do a billion floating point
 

2343
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,990
know do a billion floating point
operations a second and you know you're

2344
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:56,000
operations a second and you know you're
 

2345
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,309
operations a second and you know you're
you're puzzling for for minutes through

2346
00:41:58,309 --> 00:41:58,319
you're puzzling for for minutes through
 

2347
00:41:58,319 --> 00:41:59,510
you're puzzling for for minutes through
one

2348
00:41:59,510 --> 00:41:59,520
one
 

2349
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,950
one
so you know

2350
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:00,960
so you know
 

2351
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,670
so you know
i i am i mean i i don't know but i am

2352
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:03,680
i i am i mean i i don't know but i am
 

2353
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,589
i i am i mean i i don't know but i am
certainly surprised

2354
00:42:05,589 --> 00:42:05,599
certainly surprised
 

2355
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:07,270
certainly surprised
there's something

2356
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:07,280
there's something
 

2357
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,390
there's something
uh to me different about learning

2358
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:10,400
uh to me different about learning
 

2359
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,390
uh to me different about learning
so system that's able to learn learning

2360
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:12,400
so system that's able to learn learning
 

2361
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,390
so system that's able to learn learning
now see now you get into one of the

2362
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:14,400
now see now you get into one of the
 

2363
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,030
now see now you get into one of the
deadly sins

2364
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:17,040
deadly sins
 

2365
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:17,910
deadly sins
because

2366
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:17,920
because
 

2367
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:21,030
because
of using terms uh overly broadly yeah i

2368
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:21,040
of using terms uh overly broadly yeah i
 

2369
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,710
of using terms uh overly broadly yeah i
mean there's so many different forms of

2370
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:22,720
mean there's so many different forms of
 

2371
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,550
mean there's so many different forms of
learning yeah and so many different

2372
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:24,560
learning yeah and so many different
 

2373
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,990
learning yeah and so many different
forms you know i learned my way around

2374
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:26,000
forms you know i learned my way around
 

2375
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,230
forms you know i learned my way around
the city i learned to play chess i

2376
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:28,240
the city i learned to play chess i
 

2377
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,550
the city i learned to play chess i
learnt latin um i learned to ride a

2378
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:30,560
learnt latin um i learned to ride a
 

2379
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,230
learnt latin um i learned to ride a
bicycle all of those are

2380
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:32,240
bicycle all of those are
 

2381
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,790
bicycle all of those are
you know are very different capabilities

2382
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:34,800
you know are very different capabilities
 

2383
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,990
you know are very different capabilities
yeah and

2384
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:36,000
yeah and
 

2385
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,430
yeah and
if someone

2386
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:37,440
if someone
 

2387
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:40,069
if someone
you know has a

you know has a
 

2389
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:42,150
you know has a
in you know in the old days people would

2390
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:42,160
in you know in the old days people would
 

2391
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,390
in you know in the old days people would
write a paper about learning something

2392
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:44,400
write a paper about learning something
 

2393
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,309
write a paper about learning something
now the corporate

2394
00:42:46,309 --> 00:42:46,319
now the corporate
 

2395
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:48,150
now the corporate
press office puts out a press release

2396
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:48,160
press office puts out a press release
 

2397
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,750
press office puts out a press release
about how

2398
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:49,760
about how
 

2399
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,990
about how
company x has

2402
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:52,880
has
 

2403
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,109
has
is leading the world because they have a

2404
00:42:55,109 --> 00:42:55,119
is leading the world because they have a
 

2405
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:56,870
is leading the world because they have a
system that can

2406
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:56,880
system that can
 

2407
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,870
system that can
yeah but here's the thing okay so what

2408
00:42:58,870 --> 00:42:58,880
yeah but here's the thing okay so what
 

2409
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,069
yeah but here's the thing okay so what
is learning

2410
00:43:00,069 --> 00:43:00,079
is learning
 

2411
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:01,829
is learning
what i'm referring to there's many

2412
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:01,839
what i'm referring to there's many
 

2413
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:03,430
what i'm referring to there's many
things but

2414
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:03,440
things but
 

2415
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,750
things but
a suitcase would it's a suitcase word

2416
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:05,760
a suitcase would it's a suitcase word
 

2417
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:06,550
a suitcase would it's a suitcase word
but

2418
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:06,560
but
 

2419
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,069
but
loosely

2420
00:43:08,069 --> 00:43:08,079
loosely
 

2421
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:10,069
loosely
there's a dumb system

2422
00:43:10,069 --> 00:43:10,079
there's a dumb system
 

2423
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:11,750
there's a dumb system
and over time

2424
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:11,760
and over time
 

2425
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,670
and over time
it becomes smart

2426
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:13,680
it becomes smart
 

2427
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,670
it becomes smart
well it becomes less dumb at the thing

2428
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:15,680
well it becomes less dumb at the thing
 

2429
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,190
well it becomes less dumb at the thing
that it's doing yeah smart is a

2430
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:17,200
that it's doing yeah smart is a
 

2431
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,910
that it's doing yeah smart is a
different mass is a loaded word yes less

2432
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:19,920
different mass is a loaded word yes less
 

2433
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,589
different mass is a loaded word yes less
less dominant thing is again it gets

2434
00:43:21,589 --> 00:43:21,599
less dominant thing is again it gets
 

2435
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,510
less dominant thing is again it gets
better performance under some measure

2436
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:23,520
better performance under some measure
 

2437
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,390
better performance under some measure
yeah and some set of conditions at that

2438
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:26,400
yeah and some set of conditions at that
 

2439
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,790
yeah and some set of conditions at that
thing and and most of these learning

2440
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:28,800
thing and and most of these learning
 

2441
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,230
thing and and most of these learning
algorithms

2442
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:30,240

um

2444
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:31,119

uh learning systems

2446
00:43:33,349 --> 00:43:33,359
uh learning systems
 

2447
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:36,069
uh learning systems
fail when you change the conditions just

2448
00:43:36,069 --> 00:43:36,079
fail when you change the conditions just
 

2449
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:37,990
fail when you change the conditions just
a little bit in a way that humans don't

2450
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:38,000
a little bit in a way that humans don't
 

2451
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,190
a little bit in a way that humans don't
so right i was at deepmind

2452
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:41,200
so right i was at deepmind
 

2453
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:41,990
so right i was at deepmind
um

2454
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:42,000
um
 

2455
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,230
um
the alphago had just come out

2456
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:44,240
the alphago had just come out
 

2457
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,069
the alphago had just come out
and i said what would have happened if

2458
00:43:46,069 --> 00:43:46,079
and i said what would have happened if
 

2459
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:48,630
and i said what would have happened if
you'd given a 21 by 21 board instead of

2460
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:48,640
you'd given a 21 by 21 board instead of
 

2461
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,670
you'd given a 21 by 21 board instead of
a 19 by 19 board they said fail totally

2462
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:51,680
a 19 by 19 board they said fail totally
 

2463
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,270
a 19 by 19 board they said fail totally
but a human player would actually you

2464
00:43:53,270 --> 00:43:53,280
but a human player would actually you
 

2465
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,630
but a human player would actually you
know well

2466
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:54,640
know well
 

2467
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:55,750
know well
would actually have to play again and

2468
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:55,760
would actually have to play again and
 

2469
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,190
would actually have to play again and
actually funny enough if you look at

2470
00:43:57,190 --> 00:43:57,200
actually funny enough if you look at
 

2471
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,910
actually funny enough if you look at
deepmind's work uh since then

2472
00:43:59,910 --> 00:43:59,920
deepmind's work uh since then
 

2473
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,510
deepmind's work uh since then
uh they are pers

2474
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:01,520
uh they are pers
 

2475
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:02,470
uh they are pers
uh

2476
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:02,480
uh
 

2477
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,750
uh
they're presenting a lot of algorithms

2478
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:03,760
they're presenting a lot of algorithms
 

2479
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,510
they're presenting a lot of algorithms
that would do uh

2480
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:05,520
that would do uh
 

2481
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,349
that would do uh
that would do well at the at the bigger

2482
00:44:07,349 --> 00:44:07,359
that would do well at the at the bigger
 

2483
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:09,270
that would do well at the at the bigger
board so they're slowly expanding this

2484
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:09,280
board so they're slowly expanding this
 

2485
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,670
board so they're slowly expanding this
generalization i mean to me there's a

2486
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:11,680
generalization i mean to me there's a
 

2487
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,069
generalization i mean to me there's a
core element there i think it is very

2488
00:44:14,069 --> 00:44:14,079
core element there i think it is very
 

2489
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:16,630
core element there i think it is very
surprising to me that even in a

2490
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:16,640
surprising to me that even in a
 

2491
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:19,910
surprising to me that even in a
constrained game of chess or go

00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,790
impossible to solve okay so i thought
maybe you know i

got had a program that could beat the
world champion at checkers

2604
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:16,160
world champion at checkers
 

2605
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,550

so he had this whole farm of computers

2662
00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:21,200
so he had this whole farm of computers
 

2663
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:24,309
so he had this whole farm of computers

with self play
 

2675
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:39,670
with self play
on on ibm's production line he had more

2676
00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:39,680
on on ibm's production line he had more
 

2677
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,990
on on ibm's production line he had more
computation available to him than anyone

2678
00:47:41,990 --> 00:47:42,000
computation available to him than anyone
 

2679
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,910
computation available to him than anyone
else in the world and then he was able

2680
00:47:43,910 --> 00:47:43,920
else in the world and then he was able
 

2681
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,069
else in the world and then he was able
to produce a chess playing program i

2682
00:47:46,069 --> 00:47:46,079
to produce a chess playing program i
 

2683
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:48,069
to produce a chess playing program i
mean a checkers playing program that

2684
00:47:48,069 --> 00:47:48,079
mean a checkers playing program that
 

2685
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:49,910
mean a checkers playing program that
could beat the world champion

2686
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:49,920
could beat the world champion
 

2687
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:53,349
could beat the world champion
so that's amazing the question is

2688
00:47:53,349 --> 00:47:53,359
so that's amazing the question is
 

2689
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:55,589
so that's amazing the question is
what i mean surprised i don't just mean

2690
00:47:55,589 --> 00:47:55,599
what i mean surprised i don't just mean
 

2691
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:57,990
what i mean surprised i don't just mean
it's nice to have that accomplishment

2692
00:47:57,990 --> 00:47:58,000
it's nice to have that accomplishment
 

2693
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,510
it's nice to have that accomplishment
is there is

2694
00:47:59,510 --> 00:47:59,520
is there is
 

2695
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:00,790
is there is
a stepping

2696
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:00,800
a stepping
 

2697
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,349
a stepping
towards something that feels

2698
00:48:03,349 --> 00:48:03,359
towards something that feels
 

2699
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:04,150
towards something that feels
uh

2700
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:04,160
uh
 

2701
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,589
uh
more intelligent

2702
00:48:05,589 --> 00:48:05,599
more intelligent
 

2703
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:07,270
more intelligent
than before yeah and the question is

2704
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:07,280
than before yeah and the question is
 

2705
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,109
than before yeah and the question is
that's in your view of the world okay

2706
00:48:09,109 --> 00:48:09,119
that's in your view of the world okay
 

2707
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:10,390
that's in your view of the world okay
well let me then

2708
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:10,400
well let me then
 

2709
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,230
well let me then
it doesn't mean i'm wrong

2710
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:12,240
it doesn't mean i'm wrong
 

2711
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,630
it doesn't mean i'm wrong
no no it doesn't

2712
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:14,640
no no it doesn't
 

2713
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,790
no no it doesn't
so the question is if we keep taking

2714
00:48:16,790 --> 00:48:16,800
so the question is if we keep taking
 

2715
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,190
so the question is if we keep taking
steps like that how far that takes us

2716
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:19,200
steps like that how far that takes us
 

2717
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,630
steps like that how far that takes us
are we going to build a better

2718
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:20,640
are we going to build a better
 

2719
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,390
are we going to build a better
recommender systems are we going to

2720
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:22,400
recommender systems are we going to
 

2721
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,950
recommender systems are we going to
build better robots or will we solve

2722
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:24,960
build better robots or will we solve
 

2723
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,030
build better robots or will we solve
intelligence so

2724
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:27,040
intelligence so
 

2725
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:30,150
intelligence so
you know i'm putting my bet on

2726
00:48:30,150 --> 00:48:30,160
you know i'm putting my bet on
 

2727
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,510
you know i'm putting my bet on
um

2728

um
 

2729
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:34,470

but still missing a whole lot a lot um
 

2731
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,630
but still missing a whole lot a lot um
and and why would i say that well in

2732
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:36,640
and and why would i say that well in
 

2733
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:39,589
and and why would i say that well in
these games they're all um you know 100

2734
00:48:39,589 --> 00:48:39,599
these games they're all um you know 100

not saying that uh

2752
00:48:59,750 --> 00:48:59,760
not saying that uh
 

2753
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,750
not saying that uh

the physical world i i definitely think
 

2763
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:10,790
the physical world i i definitely think
is is way harder than the game of chess

2764
00:49:10,790 --> 00:49:10,800
is is way harder than the game of chess
 

2765
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,190
is is way harder than the game of chess
so i was always much more impressed by

2766
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:13,200
so i was always much more impressed by
 

2767
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,190
so i was always much more impressed by
like the workings of the human mind

2768
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:15,200
like the workings of the human mind
 

2769
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:16,470
like the workings of the human mind
that's incredible the human mind is

2770
00:49:16,470 --> 00:49:16,480
that's incredible the human mind is
 

2771
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,470
that's incredible the human mind is
incredible i've i believe that from the

2772
00:49:18,470 --> 00:49:18,480
incredible i've i believe that from the
 

2773
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:19,270
incredible i've i believe that from the
very beginning i want to be a

2774
00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:19,280
very beginning i want to be a
 

2775
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,950
very beginning i want to be a
psychiatrist for the longest time i

2776
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:20,960
psychiatrist for the longest time i
 

2777
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:21,990
psychiatrist for the longest time i
always thought that's way more

2778
00:49:21,990 --> 00:49:22,000
always thought that's way more
 

2779
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,349
always thought that's way more
incredible in the game of chess i think

2780
00:49:23,349 --> 00:49:23,359
incredible in the game of chess i think
 

2781
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:25,670
incredible in the game of chess i think
the game of chess is uh

2782
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:25,680
the game of chess is uh
 

2783
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,670
the game of chess is uh
i love the olympics it's just another

2784
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:27,680
i love the olympics it's just another
 

2785
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,750
i love the olympics it's just another
example of us humans picking a task and

2786
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:29,760
example of us humans picking a task and
 

2787
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,069
example of us humans picking a task and
then agreeing that a million humans will

2788
00:49:32,069 --> 00:49:32,079
then agreeing that a million humans will
 

2789
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:33,829
then agreeing that a million humans will
dedicate their whole life to that task

2790
00:49:33,829 --> 00:49:33,839
dedicate their whole life to that task
 

2791
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:36,309
dedicate their whole life to that task
and that's the cool thing that the human

2792
00:49:36,309 --> 00:49:36,319
and that's the cool thing that the human
 

2793
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:39,030
and that's the cool thing that the human
mind is able to focus on one task and

2794
00:49:39,030 --> 00:49:39,040
mind is able to focus on one task and
 

2795
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:40,950
mind is able to focus on one task and
then compete against each other and

2796
00:49:40,950 --> 00:49:40,960
then compete against each other and
 

2797
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:43,349
then compete against each other and
achieve like weirdly incredible levels

2798
00:49:43,349 --> 00:49:43,359
achieve like weirdly incredible levels
 

2799
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:44,470
achieve like weirdly incredible levels
of performance

2800
00:49:44,470 --> 00:49:44,480
of performance
 

2801
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,309
of performance
that's the aspect of chess that's super

2802
00:49:46,309 --> 00:49:46,319
that's the aspect of chess that's super
 

2803
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:48,870
that's the aspect of chess that's super
cool not that chess in itself uh is

2804
00:49:48,870 --> 00:49:48,880
cool not that chess in itself uh is
 

2805
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,549
cool not that chess in itself uh is
really difficult it's it's it's like the

2806
00:49:50,549 --> 00:49:50,559
really difficult it's it's it's like the
 

2807
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:52,549
really difficult it's it's it's like the
framazlast theorem is not in itself to

2808
00:49:52,549 --> 00:49:52,559
framazlast theorem is not in itself to
 

2809
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:54,790
framazlast theorem is not in itself to
me that interesting the fact that uh

2810
00:49:54,790 --> 00:49:54,800
me that interesting the fact that uh
 

2811
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,390
me that interesting the fact that uh
thousands of people have been struggling

2812
00:49:56,390 --> 00:49:56,400
thousands of people have been struggling
 

2813
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:57,910
thousands of people have been struggling
to solve that particular problem is

2814
00:49:57,910 --> 00:49:57,920
to solve that particular problem is
 

2815
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,910
to solve that particular problem is
fascinating so can i tell you my disease

2816
00:49:59,910 --> 00:49:59,920
fascinating so can i tell you my disease
 

2817
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,510
fascinating so can i tell you my disease
in this way sure

2818
00:50:01,510 --> 00:50:01,520
in this way sure
 

2819
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,190
in this way sure
which actually is closer to what you're

2820
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:03,200
which actually is closer to what you're
 

2821
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,030
which actually is closer to what you're
saying so as a child you know i was

2822
00:50:05,030 --> 00:50:05,040
saying so as a child you know i was
 

2823
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,589
saying so as a child you know i was
building various i called them computers

2824
00:50:07,589 --> 00:50:07,599
building various i called them computers
 

2825
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:09,349
building various i called them computers
they weren't general purpose computers

2826
00:50:09,349 --> 00:50:09,359
they weren't general purpose computers
 

2827
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:11,349
they weren't general purpose computers
ice cube tray the ice cube tray was one

2828
00:50:11,349 --> 00:50:11,359
ice cube tray the ice cube tray was one
 

2829
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:13,030
ice cube tray the ice cube tray was one
but i built other machines and what i

2830
00:50:13,030 --> 00:50:13,040
but i built other machines and what i
 

2831
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:15,270
but i built other machines and what i
like to build was machines that could

2832
00:50:15,270 --> 00:50:15,280
like to build was machines that could
 

2833
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,510
like to build was machines that could
beat adults at a game and they couldn't

2834
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:17,520
beat adults at a game and they couldn't
 

2835
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,670
beat adults at a game and they couldn't
they adults couldn't beat my machine

2836
00:50:19,670 --> 00:50:19,680
they adults couldn't beat my machine
 

2837
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:22,470
they adults couldn't beat my machine
yeah so you were like uh that's powerful

2838
00:50:22,470 --> 00:50:22,480
yeah so you were like uh that's powerful
 

2839
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:25,349
yeah so you were like uh that's powerful
like that's uh that's a way to rebel

2840
00:50:25,349 --> 00:50:25,359
like that's uh that's a way to rebel
 

2841
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:28,390
like that's uh that's a way to rebel
yeah i i by the way um

2842
00:50:28,390 --> 00:50:28,400
yeah i i by the way um
 

2843
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,270
yeah i i by the way um
did you

2844
00:50:29,270 --> 00:50:29,280
did you
 

2845
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,030
did you
when was the first time you built

2846
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:31,040
when was the first time you built
 

2847
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,430
when was the first time you built
something that outperformed you do you

2848
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:33,440
something that outperformed you do you
 

2849
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,430
something that outperformed you do you
remember like well

2850
00:50:35,430 --> 00:50:35,440
remember like well
 

2851
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,190
remember like well
i knew how it worked i was probably nine

2852
00:50:37,190 --> 00:50:37,200
i knew how it worked i was probably nine
 

2853
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,670
i knew how it worked i was probably nine
years old and i built a thing that

2854
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:39,680
years old and i built a thing that
 

2855
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:41,990
years old and i built a thing that
it was a game where you you take turns

2856
00:50:41,990 --> 00:50:42,000
it was a game where you you take turns
 

2857
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,190
it was a game where you you take turns
in taking

2858
00:50:43,190 --> 00:50:43,200
in taking
 

2859
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,510
in taking
matches from a pile and

2860
00:50:45,510 --> 00:50:45,520
matches from a pile and
 

2861
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,109
matches from a pile and
either the one who takes the last one or

2862
00:50:47,109 --> 00:50:47,119
either the one who takes the last one or
 

2863
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:48,390
either the one who takes the last one or
the one who doesn't take the last one

2864
00:50:48,390 --> 00:50:48,400
the one who doesn't take the last one
 

2865
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,470
the one who doesn't take the last one
wins i forget and so it was pretty easy

2866
00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:50,480
wins i forget and so it was pretty easy
 

2867
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:53,510
wins i forget and so it was pretty easy
to build that out of wires and nails and

2868
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:53,520
to build that out of wires and nails and
 

2869
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,430
to build that out of wires and nails and
little coils that were like plugging in

2870
00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:55,440
little coils that were like plugging in
 

2871
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:58,630
little coils that were like plugging in
the number and a few light bulbs

2872
00:50:58,630 --> 00:50:58,640
the number and a few light bulbs
 

2873
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,870
the number and a few light bulbs
um the one the one i was prouder of i

2874
00:51:00,870 --> 00:51:00,880
um the one the one i was prouder of i
 

2875
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:03,349
um the one the one i was prouder of i
was 12 when i built a

2876
00:51:03,349 --> 00:51:03,359
was 12 when i built a
 

2877
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:05,030
was 12 when i built a
a thing out of old

2878
00:51:05,030 --> 00:51:05,040
a thing out of old
 

2879
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,430
a thing out of old
telephone switchboard switches that

2880
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:07,440
telephone switchboard switches that
 

2881
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:11,430
telephone switchboard switches that
could uh always uh win at tic-tac-toe

2882
00:51:11,430 --> 00:51:11,440
could uh always uh win at tic-tac-toe
 

2883
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,510
could uh always uh win at tic-tac-toe
and that was a much harder circuit

2884
00:51:13,510 --> 00:51:13,520
and that was a much harder circuit
 

2885
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,829
and that was a much harder circuit
to design but again it was just

2886
00:51:15,829 --> 00:51:15,839
to design but again it was just
 

2887
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:18,309
to design but again it was just
it was no active components it was just

2888
00:51:18,309 --> 00:51:18,319
it was no active components it was just
 

2889
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:21,030
it was no active components it was just
three position switches empty x

2890
00:51:21,030 --> 00:51:21,040
three position switches empty x
 

2891
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:23,349
three position switches empty x
zero

2892
00:51:23,349 --> 00:51:23,359
zero
 

2893
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:24,549
zero
and um

2894
00:51:24,549 --> 00:51:24,559
and um
 

2895
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:27,030
and um
and nine of them and and a light bulb

2896
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:27,040
and nine of them and and a light bulb
 

2897
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:29,589
and nine of them and and a light bulb
one which which move it wanted next and

2898
00:51:29,589 --> 00:51:29,599
one which which move it wanted next and
 

2899
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:31,349
one which which move it wanted next and
then yeah the human would go and move

2900
00:51:31,349 --> 00:51:31,359
then yeah the human would go and move
 

2901
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:33,910
then yeah the human would go and move
that see there's magic in that creation

2902
00:51:33,910 --> 00:51:33,920
that see there's magic in that creation
 

2903
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,390
that see there's magic in that creation
yeah yeah i tend to uh i tend to see

2904
00:51:36,390 --> 00:51:36,400
yeah yeah i tend to uh i tend to see
 

2905
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,829
yeah yeah i tend to uh i tend to see
magic in robots that

2906
00:51:39,829 --> 00:51:39,839
magic in robots that
 

2907
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:42,950
magic in robots that
like i i also think that intelligence is

2908
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:42,960
like i i also think that intelligence is
 

2909
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,190
like i i also think that intelligence is
uh is a little bit overrated i think we

2910
00:51:45,190 --> 00:51:45,200
uh is a little bit overrated i think we
 

2911
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,510
uh is a little bit overrated i think we
can have deep connections with robots

2912
00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:47,520
can have deep connections with robots
 

2913
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:49,109
can have deep connections with robots
very soon

2914
00:51:49,109 --> 00:51:49,119
very soon
 

2915
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:51,589
very soon
and well we'll come back to connections

2916
00:51:51,589 --> 00:51:51,599
and well we'll come back to connections
 

2917
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:54,470
and well we'll come back to connections
robot sure but but i do want to say

2918
00:51:54,470 --> 00:51:54,480
robot sure but but i do want to say
 

2919
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,870
robot sure but but i do want to say
i i don't i i think people too many

2920
00:51:56,870 --> 00:51:56,880

was doors surprising to you that it

was doors surprising to you that it
 

3057
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:22,470
was doors surprising to you that it
worked

3058

worked
 

3059
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:24,470
worked
as well as it did

3060
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:24,480
as well as it did
 

3061
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,069
as well as it did
okay so if we're going to make the

3062
00:54:26,069 --> 00:54:26,079
okay so if we're going to make the
 

3063
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:27,990
okay so if we're going to make the
distinction between

3064
00:54:27,990 --> 00:54:28,000
distinction between
 

3065
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,109
distinction between
surprise and usefulness and and and

surprise and usefulness and and and
 

3067
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:33,190

i'll i have to explain

3068
00:54:33,190 --> 00:54:33,200
i'll i have to explain
 

3069
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:36,069
i'll i have to explain
this i would say alpha fold

3070
00:54:36,069 --> 00:54:36,079
this i would say alpha fold
 

3071
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:38,309
this i would say alpha fold
and

and
 

3073
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:40,309
and
one of the problems at the moment with

3074
00:54:40,309 --> 00:54:40,319
one of the problems at the moment with
 

3075
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:41,589
one of the problems at the moment with
alpha fold is

3076
00:54:41,589 --> 00:54:41,599
alpha fold is
 

3077
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:43,349
alpha fold is
you know it gets a lot of them right

3078
00:54:43,349 --> 00:54:43,359
you know it gets a lot of them right
 

3079
00:54:43,359 --> 00:54:44,630
you know it gets a lot of them right
which is a surprise to me because

00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:47,109
which is a surprise to me because
they're a really complex thing uh but

3082
00:54:47,109 --> 00:54:47,119
they're a really complex thing uh but
 

3083
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:49,829
they're a really complex thing uh but
you don't know which ones it gets right

3084
00:54:49,829 --> 00:54:49,839
you don't know which ones it gets right
 

3085
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:50,789
you don't know which ones it gets right
which

3086
00:54:50,789 --> 00:54:50,799
which
 

3087
00:54:50,799 --> 00:54:52,789
which
then is a bit of a problem now they've

3088
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:52,799
then is a bit of a problem now they've
 

3089
00:54:52,799 --> 00:54:53,990
then is a bit of a problem now they've
come out with a reason you mean the

3090
00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:54,000
come out with a reason you mean the
 

3091
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,349
come out with a reason you mean the
structure of the protein it gets a lot

3092
00:54:55,349 --> 00:54:55,359
structure of the protein it gets a lot
 

3093
00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:57,190
structure of the protein it gets a lot
of those right yeah it's a it's

3094
00:54:57,190 --> 00:54:57,200
of those right yeah it's a it's
 

3095
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,589
of those right yeah it's a it's
surprising right yeah it's been a really

3096
00:54:59,589 --> 00:54:59,599
surprising right yeah it's been a really
 

3097
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:01,270
surprising right yeah it's been a really
hard problem so that was a surprise how

3098
00:55:01,270 --> 00:55:01,280
hard problem so that was a surprise how
 

3099
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:03,270
hard problem so that was a surprise how
many it gets right

3100
00:55:03,270 --> 00:55:03,280
many it gets right
 

3101
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:05,589
many it gets right
so far the usefulness is limited because

3102
00:55:05,589 --> 00:55:05,599
so far the usefulness is limited because
 

3103
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:07,030
so far the usefulness is limited because
you don't know which ones are right or

3104
00:55:07,030 --> 00:55:07,040
you don't know which ones are right or
 

3105
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:10,150
you don't know which ones are right or
not and now they've come out with a

3106
00:55:10,150 --> 00:55:10,160
not and now they've come out with a
 

3107
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:11,510
not and now they've come out with a
thing in the last few weeks which is

3108
00:55:11,510 --> 00:55:11,520
thing in the last few weeks which is
 

3109
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,910
thing in the last few weeks which is
trying to get a useful tool out of it

3110
00:55:13,910 --> 00:55:13,920
trying to get a useful tool out of it
 

3111
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:16,150
trying to get a useful tool out of it
and they may well do it um in that sense

3112
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:16,160
and they may well do it um in that sense
 

3113
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:18,309
and they may well do it um in that sense
the least alpha fold is different

3114
00:55:18,309 --> 00:55:18,319
the least alpha fold is different
 

3115
00:55:18,319 --> 00:55:19,589
the least alpha fold is different
because your

3116
00:55:19,589 --> 00:55:19,599
because your
 

3117
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:21,910
because your
alpha fold two is different

3118
00:55:21,910 --> 00:55:21,920
alpha fold two is different
 

3119
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:24,069
alpha fold two is different
because now it's producing data sets

3120
00:55:24,069 --> 00:55:24,079
because now it's producing data sets
 

3121
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:25,829
because now it's producing data sets
that are actually uh

3122
00:55:25,829 --> 00:55:25,839
that are actually uh
 

3123
00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:27,510
that are actually uh
you know potentially revolutionizing

3124
00:55:27,510 --> 00:55:27,520
you know potentially revolutionizing
 

3125
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:29,030
you know potentially revolutionizing
computational biology like they will

3126
00:55:29,030 --> 00:55:29,040
computational biology like they will
 

3127
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:31,270
computational biology like they will
actually help a lot of people

3128
00:55:31,270 --> 00:55:31,280
actually help a lot of people
 

3129
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:32,630
actually help a lot of people
but you would say

3130
00:55:32,630 --> 00:55:32,640
but you would say
 

3131
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:34,710
but you would say
uh potentially revolutionizing we don't

3132
00:55:34,710 --> 00:55:34,720
uh potentially revolutionizing we don't
 

3133
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:37,030
uh potentially revolutionizing we don't
know yet but yeah that's true yeah but

3134
00:55:37,030 --> 00:55:37,040
know yet but yeah that's true yeah but
 

3135
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:39,349
know yet but yeah that's true yeah but
they're you know but i i i got you i

3136
00:55:39,349 --> 00:55:39,359
they're you know but i i i got you i
 

3137
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:41,430
they're you know but i i i got you i
mean this is okay so you know what this

3138
00:55:41,430 --> 00:55:41,440
mean this is okay so you know what this
 

3139
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:44,630
mean this is okay so you know what this
is gonna be so fun so let's go

3140
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:44,640
is gonna be so fun so let's go
 

3141
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:47,829
is gonna be so fun so let's go
right into it speaking of robots that

3142
00:55:47,829 --> 00:55:47,839
right into it speaking of robots that
 

3143
00:55:47,839 --> 00:55:50,150
right into it speaking of robots that
operate in the real world

3144
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:50,160
operate in the real world
 

3145

let's talk about self-driving cars

3146
00:55:52,789 --> 00:55:52,799
let's talk about self-driving cars
 

3147
00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:54,549
let's talk about self-driving cars
oh

3148
00:55:54,549 --> 00:55:54,559
oh
 

3149
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:55,510
oh
okay

3150
00:55:55,510 --> 00:55:55,520
okay
 

3151
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:57,910
okay
because you do you have built robotics

3152
00:55:57,910 --> 00:55:57,920
because you do you have built robotics
 

3153
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:59,670
because you do you have built robotics

uh these are robots they're being used

3192
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:40,640
uh these are robots they're being used
 

3193
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,150
uh these are robots they're being used
in the real world by hundreds of

if you want to go there i can go there
 

3201
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:49,990
if you want to go there i can go there
but that's not too much which there is

with
 

3229
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:28,950
with
many aspects of it and and i'm

3230
00:57:28,950 --> 00:57:28,960
many aspects of it and and i'm
 

3231
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:31,510
many aspects of it and and i'm
um it's able to stay in lane is it uh oh

3232
00:57:31,510 --> 00:57:31,520
um it's able to stay in lane is it uh oh
 

3233
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:33,990
um it's able to stay in lane is it uh oh
yeah it does it does the lane stuff um

3234
00:57:33,990 --> 00:57:34,000
yeah it does it does the lane stuff um
 

3235
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:34,950
yeah it does it does the lane stuff um
it uh

3236
00:57:34,950 --> 00:57:34,960
it uh
 

3237
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,589
it uh
you know it's it's looking up on either

3238
00:57:37,589 --> 00:57:37,599
you know it's it's looking up on either
 

3239
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:39,829
you know it's it's looking up on either
side of me it's telling me about nearby

01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:35,270
uh was
was way more limited than the actual

3400
01:00:35,270 --> 01:00:35,280
was way more limited than the actual
 

3401
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:37,510
was way more limited than the actual
implementation of mobile eye i was so

3402
01:00:37,510 --> 01:00:37,520
implementation of mobile eye i was so
 

3403
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:39,109
implementation of mobile eye i was so
that's one example i was really

3404
01:00:39,109 --> 01:00:39,119
that's one example i was really
 

3405
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:41,430
that's one example i was really
surprised i was like wow that was that

3406
01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:41,440
surprised i was like wow that was that
 

3407
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:42,390
surprised i was like wow that was that
was incredible

3408
01:00:42,390 --> 01:00:42,400
was incredible
 

3409
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:44,230
was incredible
the second surprise came

3410
01:00:44,230 --> 01:00:44,240
the second surprise came
 

3411
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:48,309
the second surprise came
when tesla threw away mobileye

3412
01:00:48,309 --> 01:00:48,319
when tesla threw away mobileye
 

3413
01:00:48,319 --> 01:00:50,710
when tesla threw away mobileye
and started from scratch

3414
01:00:50,710 --> 01:00:50,720
and started from scratch
 

3415
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:52,230
and started from scratch
uh i thought there's no way they can

3416
01:00:52,230 --> 01:00:52,240
uh i thought there's no way they can
 

3417
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:53,910
uh i thought there's no way they can
catch up to mobile eye i thought what

3418
01:00:53,910 --> 01:00:53,920
catch up to mobile eye i thought what
 

3419
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:55,430
catch up to mobile eye i thought what
mobile i was doing was kind of

3420
01:00:55,430 --> 01:00:55,440
mobile i was doing was kind of
 

3421
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:56,870
mobile i was doing was kind of
incredible like the amount of work and

3422
01:00:56,870 --> 01:00:56,880
incredible like the amount of work and
 

3423
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,549
incredible like the amount of work and
the annotation yeah well mobile i was

3424
01:00:58,549 --> 01:00:58,559
the annotation yeah well mobile i was
 

3425
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:00,789
the annotation yeah well mobile i was
started by amazon structure and and used

3426
01:01:00,789 --> 01:01:00,799
started by amazon structure and and used
 

3427
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:02,710
started by amazon structure and and used
a lot of traditional you know

3428
01:01:02,710 --> 01:01:02,720
a lot of traditional you know
 

3429
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:05,109
a lot of traditional you know
hard-fought computer vision techniques

3430
01:01:05,109 --> 01:01:05,119
hard-fought computer vision techniques
 

3431
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:07,510
hard-fought computer vision techniques
but they also did a lot of good sort of

3432
01:01:07,510 --> 01:01:07,520
but they also did a lot of good sort of
 

3433
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:10,470
but they also did a lot of good sort of
uh like non-research stuff like actual

3434
01:01:10,470 --> 01:01:10,480
uh like non-research stuff like actual
 

3435
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:11,670
uh like non-research stuff like actual
like

3436
01:01:11,670 --> 01:01:11,680
like
 

3437
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:13,910
like
uh just good like what you do to make a

3438
01:01:13,910 --> 01:01:13,920
uh just good like what you do to make a
 

3439
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,069
uh just good like what you do to make a
successful product right scaled all that

3440
01:01:16,069 --> 01:01:16,079
successful product right scaled all that
 

3441
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:17,510
successful product right scaled all that
kind of stuff and so i was very

3442
01:01:17,510 --> 01:01:17,520
kind of stuff and so i was very
 

3443
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:19,030
kind of stuff and so i was very
surprised when they from scratch were

3444
01:01:19,030 --> 01:01:19,040
surprised when they from scratch were
 

3445
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:21,109
surprised when they from scratch were
able to catch up to that

3446
01:01:21,109 --> 01:01:21,119
able to catch up to that
 

3447
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:22,630
able to catch up to that
uh that's very impressive and i've

3448
01:01:22,630 --> 01:01:22,640
uh that's very impressive and i've
 

3449
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:23,750
uh that's very impressive and i've
talked to a lot of engineers though i

3450
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:23,760
talked to a lot of engineers though i
 

3451
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:25,349
talked to a lot of engineers though i
was involved this is

3452
01:01:25,349 --> 01:01:25,359
was involved this is
 

3453
01:01:25,359 --> 01:01:28,150
was involved this is
that was impressive uh and

3454
01:01:28,150 --> 01:01:28,160
that was impressive uh and
 

3455
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:30,870
that was impressive uh and
the recent progress especially under um

3456
01:01:30,870 --> 01:01:30,880
the recent progress especially under um
 

3457
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:32,230
the recent progress especially under um
well with the involvement of andre

3458
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:32,240
well with the involvement of andre
 

3459
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:33,829
well with the involvement of andre
kupathi

3460
01:01:33,829 --> 01:01:33,839
kupathi
 

3461
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:35,670
kupathi
the what they were

3462
01:01:35,670 --> 01:01:35,680
the what they were
 

3463
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:38,069
the what they were
what they're doing with the data engine

3464
01:01:38,069 --> 01:01:38,079
what they're doing with the data engine
 

3465
01:01:38,079 --> 01:01:39,990
what they're doing with the data engine
which is converting into the driving

3466
01:01:39,990 --> 01:01:40,000
which is converting into the driving
 

3467
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,230
which is converting into the driving
task into these multiple tasks and then

3468
01:01:42,230 --> 01:01:42,240
task into these multiple tasks and then
 

3469
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:43,910
task into these multiple tasks and then
doing this edge case discovery when

3470
01:01:43,910 --> 01:01:43,920
doing this edge case discovery when
 

3471
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:46,150
doing this edge case discovery when
they're pulling back like the level of

3472
01:01:46,150 --> 01:01:46,160
they're pulling back like the level of
 

3473
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:48,230
they're pulling back like the level of
engineering

3474
01:01:48,230 --> 01:01:48,240
engineering
 

3475
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:50,630
engineering
made me rethink what's possible i don't

3476
01:01:50,630 --> 01:01:50,640
made me rethink what's possible i don't
 

3477
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:53,030
made me rethink what's possible i don't
i still you know um

3478
01:01:53,030 --> 01:01:53,040
i still you know um
 

3479
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:54,549
i still you know um
i don't know to that intensity but i

3480
01:01:54,549 --> 01:01:54,559
i don't know to that intensity but i
 

3481
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:56,069
i don't know to that intensity but i
always thought it was very difficult to

3482
01:01:56,069 --> 01:01:56,079
always thought it was very difficult to
 

3483
01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:58,230
always thought it was very difficult to
solve anton was driving with all the

3484
01:01:58,230 --> 01:01:58,240
solve anton was driving with all the
 

3485
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:00,470
solve anton was driving with all the
sensors with all the computation i just

3486
01:02:00,470 --> 01:02:00,480
sensors with all the computation i just
 

3487
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:02,390
sensors with all the computation i just
thought it was a very difficult problem

3488
01:02:02,390 --> 01:02:02,400
thought it was a very difficult problem
 

3489
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:04,069
thought it was a very difficult problem
but i've been

3490
01:02:04,069 --> 01:02:04,079
but i've been
 

3491
01:02:04,079 --> 01:02:06,390
but i've been
continuously surprised

3492
01:02:06,390 --> 01:02:06,400
continuously surprised
 

3493
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:08,230
continuously surprised
how much you can engineer first of all

3494
01:02:08,230 --> 01:02:08,240
how much you can engineer first of all
 

3495
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:10,230
how much you can engineer first of all
the data acquisition problem because i

3496
01:02:10,230 --> 01:02:10,240
the data acquisition problem because i
 

3497
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:11,270
the data acquisition problem because i
thought

3498
01:02:11,270 --> 01:02:11,280
thought
 

3499
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:12,630
thought
you know just because i worked with a

3500
01:02:12,630 --> 01:02:12,640
you know just because i worked with a
 

3501
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:14,470
you know just because i worked with a
lot of car companies

3502
01:02:14,470 --> 01:02:14,480
lot of car companies
 

3503
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:15,589
lot of car companies
and

3504
01:02:15,589 --> 01:02:15,599
and
 

3505
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:16,789
and
they're

3506
01:02:16,789 --> 01:02:16,799
they're
 

3507
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:18,789
they're
they're so a little

3508
01:02:18,789 --> 01:02:18,799
they're so a little
 

3509
01:02:18,799 --> 01:02:20,630
they're so a little
a little bit old school to where i

3510
01:02:20,630 --> 01:02:20,640
a little bit old school to where i
 

3511
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:22,630
a little bit old school to where i
didn't think they could do this at scale

3512
01:02:22,630 --> 01:02:22,640
didn't think they could do this at scale
 

3513
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:24,870
didn't think they could do this at scale
like aws style

3514
01:02:24,870 --> 01:02:24,880
like aws style
 

3515
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:27,349
like aws style
data collection so when tesla was able

3516
01:02:27,349 --> 01:02:27,359
data collection so when tesla was able
 

3517
01:02:27,359 --> 01:02:29,589
data collection so when tesla was able
to do that

3518
01:02:29,589 --> 01:02:29,599
to do that
 

3519
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:31,349
to do that
i started to think okay so what are the

3520
01:02:31,349 --> 01:02:31,359
i started to think okay so what are the
 

3521
01:02:31,359 --> 01:02:33,109
i started to think okay so what are the
limits of this

3522
01:02:33,109 --> 01:02:33,119
limits of this
 

3523
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:34,789
limits of this
i still believe

3524
01:02:34,789 --> 01:02:34,799
i still believe
 

3525
01:02:34,799 --> 01:02:36,870
i still believe
that um

3526
01:02:36,870 --> 01:02:36,880
that um
 

3527
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:39,109
that um
driver like sensing and the interaction

3528
01:02:39,109 --> 01:02:39,119
driver like sensing and the interaction
 

3529
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:41,029
driver like sensing and the interaction
with the driver and like studying the

3530
01:02:41,029 --> 01:02:41,039
with the driver and like studying the
 

3531
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:42,789
with the driver and like studying the
human factors psychology problem is

3532
01:02:42,789 --> 01:02:42,799
human factors psychology problem is
 

3533
01:02:42,799 --> 01:02:45,190
human factors psychology problem is
essential it's it's always going to be

3534
01:02:45,190 --> 01:02:45,200
essential it's it's always going to be
 

3535
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:46,950
essential it's it's always going to be
there

3536
01:02:46,950 --> 01:02:46,960
there
 

3537
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:48,470
there
it's always going to be there even with

3538
01:02:48,470 --> 01:02:48,480
it's always going to be there even with
 

3539
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:50,230
it's always going to be there even with
fully autonomous driving

3540
01:02:50,230 --> 01:02:50,240
fully autonomous driving
 

3541
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:53,109
fully autonomous driving
but i've been surprised what is the

3542
01:02:53,109 --> 01:02:53,119
but i've been surprised what is the
 

3543
01:02:53,119 --> 01:02:56,230
but i've been surprised what is the
limit especially of vision based alone

3544
01:02:56,230 --> 01:02:56,240
limit especially of vision based alone
 

3545
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:58,230
limit especially of vision based alone
how far that can take us

3546
01:02:58,230 --> 01:02:58,240
how far that can take us
 

3547
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:01,029
how far that can take us
um so that's my level is a surprise

3548
01:03:01,029 --> 01:03:01,039
um so that's my level is a surprise
 

3549
01:03:01,039 --> 01:03:02,470
um so that's my level is a surprise
now

3550
01:03:02,470 --> 01:03:02,480
now
 

3551
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:06,069
now
okay uh can can you explain

3552
01:03:06,069 --> 01:03:06,079
okay uh can can you explain
 

3553
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:07,910
okay uh can can you explain
in the same way you said like alpha zero

3554
01:03:07,910 --> 01:03:07,920
in the same way you said like alpha zero
 

3555
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:09,589
in the same way you said like alpha zero
that's a homework problem that scaled

3556
01:03:09,589 --> 01:03:09,599
that's a homework problem that scaled
 

3557
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:12,069
that's a homework problem that scaled
large in his chest like who cares go

3558
01:03:12,069 --> 01:03:12,079
large in his chest like who cares go
 

3559
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:14,870
large in his chest like who cares go
with here's actual people using an

3560
01:03:14,870 --> 01:03:14,880
with here's actual people using an
 

3561
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:17,349
with here's actual people using an
actual car and driving many of them

3562
01:03:17,349 --> 01:03:17,359
actual car and driving many of them
 

3563
01:03:17,359 --> 01:03:19,750
actual car and driving many of them
drive more than half their miles

3564
01:03:19,750 --> 01:03:19,760
drive more than half their miles
 

3565
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:21,829
drive more than half their miles
using the system right

3566
01:03:21,829 --> 01:03:21,839
using the system right
 

3567
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:22,789
using the system right
so and

3568
01:03:22,789 --> 01:03:22,799
so and
 

3569
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:25,270
so and
yeah they're doing well with with pure

3570
01:03:25,270 --> 01:03:25,280
yeah they're doing well with with pure
 

3571
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:27,430
yeah they're doing well with with pure
vision without your vision yeah and you

3572
01:03:27,430 --> 01:03:27,440
vision without your vision yeah and you
 

3573
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:28,390
vision without your vision yeah and you
know

3574
01:03:28,390 --> 01:03:28,400
know
 

3575
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:31,270
know
and now no radar which is i suspect that

3576
01:03:31,270 --> 01:03:31,280
and now no radar which is i suspect that
 

3577
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:34,390
and now no radar which is i suspect that
can't go all the way and one reason is

3578
01:03:34,390 --> 01:03:34,400
can't go all the way and one reason is
 

3579
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,309
can't go all the way and one reason is
without without new cameras that have a

3580
01:03:36,309 --> 01:03:36,319
without without new cameras that have a
 

3581
01:03:36,319 --> 01:03:38,069
without without new cameras that have a
dynamic range closer to the human eye

3582
01:03:38,069 --> 01:03:38,079
dynamic range closer to the human eye
 

3583
01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:40,230
dynamic range closer to the human eye
because human eye has incredible dynamic

3584
01:03:40,230 --> 01:03:40,240
because human eye has incredible dynamic
 

3585
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:42,309
because human eye has incredible dynamic
range and we make use of that dynamic

3586
01:03:42,309 --> 01:03:42,319
range and we make use of that dynamic
 

3587
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:45,829
range and we make use of that dynamic
range in its uh 11 orders of magnitude

3588
01:03:45,829 --> 01:03:45,839
range in its uh 11 orders of magnitude
 

3589
01:03:45,839 --> 01:03:48,630
range in its uh 11 orders of magnitude
or some crazy number like that

3590
01:03:48,630 --> 01:03:48,640
or some crazy number like that
 

3591
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:50,470
or some crazy number like that
the cameras don't have that which is why

3592
01:03:50,470 --> 01:03:50,480
the cameras don't have that which is why
 

3593
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:53,670
the cameras don't have that which is why
you see the the the the bad cases where

3594
01:03:53,670 --> 01:03:53,680
you see the the the the bad cases where
 

3595
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:55,910
you see the the the the bad cases where
the sun on a white thing and the blinds

3596
01:03:55,910 --> 01:03:55,920
the sun on a white thing and the blinds
 

3597
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:56,549
the sun on a white thing and the blinds
are

3598
01:03:56,549 --> 01:03:56,559
are
 

3599
01:03:56,559 --> 01:04:00,870
are
in a way it wouldn't apply in the person

3600
01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:00,880

 

3601
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:01,990

i think there's

3602
01:04:01,990 --> 01:04:02,000
i think there's
 

3603
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,349
i think there's
a bunch of things

3604
01:04:03,349 --> 01:04:03,359
a bunch of things
 

3605
01:04:03,359 --> 01:04:06,230
a bunch of things
to think about before you say this is so

3606
01:04:06,230 --> 01:04:06,240
to think about before you say this is so
 

3607
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:08,950
to think about before you say this is so
good it's just gonna work

3608
01:04:08,950 --> 01:04:08,960
good it's just gonna work
 

3609
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:10,549
good it's just gonna work
okay

3610
01:04:10,549 --> 01:04:10,559
okay
 

3611
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:12,150
okay
um

3612
01:04:12,150 --> 01:04:12,160
um
 

3613
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:14,150
um
and i'll come at it from multiple angles

3614
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:14,160
and i'll come at it from multiple angles
 

3615
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:16,470
and i'll come at it from multiple angles
and i know you've got a lot of time yeah

3616
01:04:16,470 --> 01:04:16,480
and i know you've got a lot of time yeah
 

3617
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:17,750
and i know you've got a lot of time yeah
okay let's

3618
01:04:17,750 --> 01:04:17,760
okay let's
 

3619
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:20,309
okay let's
have thought about these things yeah i

3620
01:04:20,309 --> 01:04:20,319
have thought about these things yeah i
 

3621
01:04:20,319 --> 01:04:22,309
have thought about these things yeah i
know you've been writing a lot of great

3622
01:04:22,309 --> 01:04:22,319
know you've been writing a lot of great
 

3623
01:04:22,319 --> 01:04:24,829
know you've been writing a lot of great
blog posts about it for a while before

3624
01:04:24,829 --> 01:04:24,839
blog posts about it for a while before
 

3625
01:04:24,839 --> 01:04:27,829
blog posts about it for a while before
tesla had autopilot right so you've been

3626
01:04:27,829 --> 01:04:27,839
tesla had autopilot right so you've been
 

3627
01:04:27,839 --> 01:04:29,430
tesla had autopilot right so you've been
thinking about autonomous driving for a

3628
01:04:29,430 --> 01:04:29,440
thinking about autonomous driving for a
 

3629
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:31,270
thinking about autonomous driving for a
while from every angle

3630
01:04:31,270 --> 01:04:31,280
while from every angle
 

3631
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:33,029
while from every angle
so so a few things

3632
01:04:33,029 --> 01:04:33,039
so so a few things
 

3633
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:35,670
so so a few things
you know in the us um i think that the

3634
01:04:35,670 --> 01:04:35,680
you know in the us um i think that the
 

3635
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:37,430
you know in the us um i think that the
the death rate from

3636
01:04:37,430 --> 01:04:37,440
the death rate from
 

3637
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:39,270
the death rate from
motor vehicle accidents

3638
01:04:39,270 --> 01:04:39,280
motor vehicle accidents
 

3639
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:40,789
motor vehicle accidents
is about 35

3640
01:04:40,789 --> 01:04:40,799
is about 35
 

3641
01:04:40,799 --> 01:04:41,990
is about 35
000

3642
01:04:41,990 --> 01:04:42,000
000
 

3643
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,870
000
a year

3644
01:04:44,870 --> 01:04:44,880

 

3645
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:47,109

which is an outrageous number

3646
01:04:47,109 --> 01:04:47,119
which is an outrageous number
 

3647
01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:49,109
which is an outrageous number
not outrageous compared to covert deaths

3648
01:04:49,109 --> 01:04:49,119
not outrageous compared to covert deaths
 

3649
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:52,069
not outrageous compared to covert deaths
but you know there is no rationality

3650
01:04:52,069 --> 01:04:52,079
but you know there is no rationality
 

3651
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:53,750
but you know there is no rationality
and that's part of the thing people have

3652
01:04:53,750 --> 01:04:53,760
and that's part of the thing people have
 

3653
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:56,309
and that's part of the thing people have
said engineers say to me well if we cut

3654
01:04:56,309 --> 01:04:56,319
said engineers say to me well if we cut
 

3655
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:58,470
said engineers say to me well if we cut
down the number of deaths by 10 by

3656
01:04:58,470 --> 01:04:58,480
down the number of deaths by 10 by
 

3657
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:00,630
down the number of deaths by 10 by
having autonomous driving that's going

3658
01:05:00,630 --> 01:05:00,640
having autonomous driving that's going
 

3659
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:02,630
having autonomous driving that's going
to be great everyone will love it

3660
01:05:02,630 --> 01:05:02,640
to be great everyone will love it
 

3661
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:03,750
to be great everyone will love it
and

3662
01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:03,760
and
 

3663
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:05,990
and
my prediction is

3664
01:05:05,990 --> 01:05:06,000
my prediction is
 

3665
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,069
my prediction is
that if autonomous vehicles kill more

3666
01:05:08,069 --> 01:05:08,079
that if autonomous vehicles kill more
 

3667
01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:10,069
that if autonomous vehicles kill more
than 10 people a year they'll be

3668
01:05:10,069 --> 01:05:10,079
than 10 people a year they'll be
 

3669
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:12,789
than 10 people a year they'll be
screaming and hollering even though 35

3670
01:05:12,789 --> 01:05:12,799
screaming and hollering even though 35
 

3671
01:05:12,799 --> 01:05:14,950
screaming and hollering even though 35
000 people a year have been killed by

3672
01:05:14,950 --> 01:05:14,960
000 people a year have been killed by
 

3673
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:16,710
000 people a year have been killed by
human drivers

3674
01:05:16,710 --> 01:05:16,720
human drivers
 

3675
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:18,309
human drivers
it's not rational

3676
01:05:18,309 --> 01:05:18,319
it's not rational
 

3677
01:05:18,319 --> 01:05:20,630
it's not rational
it's a different set of expectations

3678
01:05:20,630 --> 01:05:20,640
it's a different set of expectations
 

3679
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:24,390
it's a different set of expectations
and that will probably continue

3680
01:05:24,390 --> 01:05:24,400

 

3681
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:26,470

so there's that aspect of it

3682
01:05:26,470 --> 01:05:26,480
so there's that aspect of it
 

3683
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:31,029
so there's that aspect of it
the other aspect of it is that

3684
01:05:31,029 --> 01:05:31,039

 

3685
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:33,990

when we introduce new technology

3686
01:05:33,990 --> 01:05:34,000
when we introduce new technology
 

3687
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,950
when we introduce new technology
we often change the rules of the game

3688
01:05:36,950 --> 01:05:36,960
we often change the rules of the game
 

3689
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:38,870
we often change the rules of the game
so when we introduced

3690
01:05:38,870 --> 01:05:38,880
so when we introduced
 

3691
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:40,950
so when we introduced
cars

3692
01:05:40,950 --> 01:05:40,960
cars
 

3693
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:41,910
cars
first

3694
01:05:41,910 --> 01:05:41,920
first
 

3695
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:44,309
first
you know into our daily lives we

3696
01:05:44,309 --> 01:05:44,319
you know into our daily lives we
 

3697
01:05:44,319 --> 01:05:46,630
you know into our daily lives we
completely rebuilt our cities and we

3698
01:05:46,630 --> 01:05:46,640
completely rebuilt our cities and we
 

3699
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:49,029
completely rebuilt our cities and we
changed all the laws yeah jaywalking was

3700
01:05:49,029 --> 01:05:49,039
changed all the laws yeah jaywalking was
 

3701
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:51,430
changed all the laws yeah jaywalking was
not an offense

3702
01:05:51,430 --> 01:05:51,440
not an offense
 

3703
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:53,430
not an offense
that was pushed by the car company so

3704
01:05:53,430 --> 01:05:53,440
that was pushed by the car company so
 

3705
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:55,029
that was pushed by the car company so
that people would stay off the road so

3706
01:05:55,029 --> 01:05:55,039
that people would stay off the road so
 

3707
01:05:55,039 --> 01:05:56,630
that people would stay off the road so
there wouldn't be deaths from

3708
01:05:56,630 --> 01:05:56,640
there wouldn't be deaths from
 

3709
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:58,309
there wouldn't be deaths from
pedestrians getting hit

3710
01:05:58,309 --> 01:05:58,319
pedestrians getting hit
 

3711
01:05:58,319 --> 01:06:00,230
pedestrians getting hit
we completely changed the structure of

3712
01:06:00,230 --> 01:06:00,240
we completely changed the structure of
 

3713
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:02,870
we completely changed the structure of
our cities and had these foul smelling

3714
01:06:02,870 --> 01:06:02,880
our cities and had these foul smelling
 

3715
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:05,589
our cities and had these foul smelling
things you know everywhere around us and

3716
01:06:05,589 --> 01:06:05,599
things you know everywhere around us and
 

3717
01:06:05,599 --> 01:06:07,510
things you know everywhere around us and
you know and now you see pushback in

3718
01:06:07,510 --> 01:06:07,520
you know and now you see pushback in
 

3719
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:09,829
you know and now you see pushback in
cities like barcelona is really trying

3720
01:06:09,829 --> 01:06:09,839
cities like barcelona is really trying
 

3721
01:06:09,839 --> 01:06:11,510
cities like barcelona is really trying
to exclude cars

3722
01:06:11,510 --> 01:06:11,520
to exclude cars
 

3723
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:12,710
to exclude cars
etc

3724
01:06:12,710 --> 01:06:12,720
etc
 

3725
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:14,309
etc
um

3726
01:06:14,309 --> 01:06:14,319
um
 

3727
01:06:14,319 --> 01:06:15,270
um
so

3728
01:06:15,270 --> 01:06:15,280
so
 

3729
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:16,789
so
i think that

3730
01:06:16,789 --> 01:06:16,799
i think that
 

3731
01:06:16,799 --> 01:06:19,270
i think that
to get to self-driving

3732
01:06:19,270 --> 01:06:19,280
to get to self-driving
 

3733
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:20,710
to get to self-driving
we will

3734
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:20,720
we will
 

3735
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:22,549
we will
um

3736
01:06:22,549 --> 01:06:22,559
um
 

3737
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:23,990
um
large adoption

3738
01:06:23,990 --> 01:06:24,000
large adoption
 

3739
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,910
large adoption
it's not going to be just take the

3740
01:06:25,910 --> 01:06:25,920
it's not going to be just take the
 

3741
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:29,109
it's not going to be just take the
current situation take out the driver

3742
01:06:29,109 --> 01:06:29,119
current situation take out the driver
 

3743
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:30,950
current situation take out the driver
and put the same car doing the same

3744
01:06:30,950 --> 01:06:30,960
and put the same car doing the same
 

3745
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:34,069
and put the same car doing the same
stuff because the end case is too many

3746
01:06:34,069 --> 01:06:34,079
stuff because the end case is too many
 

3747
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:35,589
stuff because the end case is too many
um

3748
01:06:35,589 --> 01:06:35,599
um
 

3749
01:06:35,599 --> 01:06:38,150
um
here's an interesting question

3750
01:06:38,150 --> 01:06:38,160
here's an interesting question
 

3751
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,349
here's an interesting question
how many

3752
01:06:39,349 --> 01:06:39,359
how many
 

3753
01:06:39,359 --> 01:06:42,390
how many
fully autonomous

3754
01:06:42,390 --> 01:06:42,400

 

3755
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:46,390

train systems do we have in the us

3756
01:06:46,390 --> 01:06:46,400
train systems do we have in the us
 

3757
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:47,910
train systems do we have in the us
i mean do you count them as fully

3758
01:06:47,910 --> 01:06:47,920
i mean do you count them as fully
 

3759
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:49,910
i mean do you count them as fully
autonomous i don't know because they're

3760
01:06:49,910 --> 01:06:49,920
autonomous i don't know because they're
 

3761
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:51,670
autonomous i don't know because they're
usually as a driver but they're kind of

3762
01:06:51,670 --> 01:06:51,680
usually as a driver but they're kind of
 

3763
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:53,510
usually as a driver but they're kind of
autonomous right no well

3764
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:53,520
autonomous right no well
 

3765
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:56,069
autonomous right no well
let's get rid of the driver

3766
01:06:56,069 --> 01:06:56,079
let's get rid of the driver
 

3767
01:06:56,079 --> 01:06:57,829
let's get rid of the driver
okay i don't know

3768
01:06:57,829 --> 01:06:57,839
okay i don't know
 

3769
01:06:57,839 --> 01:06:59,990
okay i don't know
it's either 15 or 16. most most of them

3770
01:06:59,990 --> 01:07:00,000
it's either 15 or 16. most most of them
 

3771
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,349
it's either 15 or 16. most most of them
are in airports

3772
01:07:01,349 --> 01:07:01,359
are in airports
 

3773
01:07:01,359 --> 01:07:04,549
are in airports
okay um there's a few that go about five

3774
01:07:04,549 --> 01:07:04,559
okay um there's a few that go about five
 

3775
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:06,549
okay um there's a few that go about five
two that go about five kilometers out of

3776
01:07:06,549 --> 01:07:06,559
two that go about five kilometers out of
 

3777
01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:08,150
two that go about five kilometers out of
airports yeah

3778
01:07:08,150 --> 01:07:08,160
airports yeah
 

3779
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:09,430
airports yeah
um

3780
01:07:09,430 --> 01:07:09,440
um
 

3781
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:10,789
um
uh

3782
01:07:10,789 --> 01:07:10,799
uh
 

3783
01:07:10,799 --> 01:07:12,630
uh
when do when is the first

3784
01:07:12,630 --> 01:07:12,640
when do when is the first
 

3785
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:15,510
when do when is the first

01:07:23,510 --> 01:07:23,520
with no driver uh in the u.s city
 

3793
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:27,029
with no driver uh in the u.s city
it's expected to operate in 2017

3794
01:07:27,029 --> 01:07:27,039
it's expected to operate in 2017
 

3795
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:29,349
it's expected to operate in 2017
in honolulu

3796
01:07:29,349 --> 01:07:29,359
in honolulu
 

3797
01:07:29,359 --> 01:07:32,309
in honolulu
it's delayed but they will get there but

3798
01:07:32,309 --> 01:07:32,319
it's delayed but they will get there but
 

3799
01:07:32,319 --> 01:07:33,589
it's delayed but they will get there but
by the way it was originally going to be

3800
01:07:33,589 --> 01:07:33,599
by the way it was originally going to be
 

3801
01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:35,750
by the way it was originally going to be
autonomous uh here in the bay area i

3802
01:07:35,750 --> 01:07:35,760
autonomous uh here in the bay area i
 

3803
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,109
autonomous uh here in the bay area i
mean they're all

3804
01:07:37,109 --> 01:07:37,119
mean they're all
 

3805
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:38,789
mean they're all
very close to fully autonomous right

3806
01:07:38,789 --> 01:07:38,799
very close to fully autonomous right
 

3807
01:07:38,799 --> 01:07:39,910
very close to fully autonomous right
yeah but

3808
01:07:39,910 --> 01:07:39,920
yeah but
 

3809
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:41,910
yeah but
getting the clues is the thing and i

3810
01:07:41,910 --> 01:07:41,920
getting the clues is the thing and i
 

3811
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:44,150
getting the clues is the thing and i
have i have i've often gone on a fully

3812
01:07:44,150 --> 01:07:44,160
have i have i've often gone on a fully
 

3813
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:47,109
have i have i've often gone on a fully
autonomous train in japan um one that

3814
01:07:47,109 --> 01:07:47,119
autonomous train in japan um one that
 

3815
01:07:47,119 --> 01:07:49,510
autonomous train in japan um one that
goes uh out to that fake island in the

3816
01:07:49,510 --> 01:07:49,520
goes uh out to that fake island in the
 

3817
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:51,510
goes uh out to that fake island in the
middle of tokyo bay i forget the name of

3818
01:07:51,510 --> 01:07:51,520
middle of tokyo bay i forget the name of
 

3819
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:52,630
middle of tokyo bay i forget the name of
the

3820
01:07:52,630 --> 01:07:52,640
the
 

3821
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:53,430
the
and

3822
01:07:53,430 --> 01:07:53,440
and
 

3823
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:55,109
and
and what do you what do you see when you

3824
01:07:55,109 --> 01:07:55,119
and what do you what do you see when you
 

3825
01:07:55,119 --> 01:07:57,349
and what do you what do you see when you
look at that what do you see when you go

3826
01:07:57,349 --> 01:07:57,359
look at that what do you see when you go
 

3827
01:07:57,359 --> 01:07:59,829
look at that what do you see when you go
to a fully autonomous train in a in a in

3828
01:07:59,829 --> 01:07:59,839
to a fully autonomous train in a in a in
 

3829
01:07:59,839 --> 01:08:01,109
to a fully autonomous train in a in a in
a

3830
01:08:01,109 --> 01:08:01,119
a
 

3831
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:03,349
a
um an airport

3832
01:08:03,349 --> 01:08:03,359
um an airport
 

3833
01:08:03,359 --> 01:08:07,029
um an airport
it's not like regular trains there's

3834
01:08:07,029 --> 01:08:07,039
it's not like regular trains there's
 

3835
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:09,349
it's not like regular trains there's
at every station there's a double set of

3836
01:08:09,349 --> 01:08:09,359
at every station there's a double set of
 

3837
01:08:09,359 --> 01:08:11,750
at every station there's a double set of
doors um so that there's the door of the

3838
01:08:11,750 --> 01:08:11,760
doors um so that there's the door of the
 

3839
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:15,109
doors um so that there's the door of the
train and this door off the the um

3840
01:08:15,109 --> 01:08:15,119
train and this door off the the um
 

3841
01:08:15,119 --> 01:08:17,990
train and this door off the the um
off the the platform yeah um

3842
01:08:17,990 --> 01:08:18,000
off the the platform yeah um
 

3843
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,630
off the the platform yeah um
and it's really visible in this japanese

3844
01:08:20,630 --> 01:08:20,640
and it's really visible in this japanese
 

3845
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:23,110
and it's really visible in this japanese
one because it goes out in in amongst

3846
01:08:23,110 --> 01:08:23,120
one because it goes out in in amongst
 

3847
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:24,709
one because it goes out in in amongst
buildings

3848
01:08:24,709 --> 01:08:24,719
buildings
 

3849
01:08:24,719 --> 01:08:26,550
buildings
the whole track is built so that people

3850
01:08:26,550 --> 01:08:26,560
the whole track is built so that people
 

3851
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:28,870
the whole track is built so that people
can't climb onto it yeah

3852
01:08:28,870 --> 01:08:28,880
can't climb onto it yeah
 

3853
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:31,030
can't climb onto it yeah
so there's engineering that then makes

3854
01:08:31,030 --> 01:08:31,040
so there's engineering that then makes
 

3855
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:32,470
so there's engineering that then makes
the system safe and makes them

3856
01:08:32,470 --> 01:08:32,480
the system safe and makes them
 

3857
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:35,189
the system safe and makes them
acceptable i think we'll see

3858
01:08:35,189 --> 01:08:35,199
acceptable i think we'll see
 

3859
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:37,430
acceptable i think we'll see
similar sorts of things happen

3860
01:08:37,430 --> 01:08:37,440
similar sorts of things happen
 

3861
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:40,550
similar sorts of things happen
in the u.s what surprised me

3862
01:08:40,550 --> 01:08:40,560
in the u.s what surprised me
 

3863
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:41,669
in the u.s what surprised me
i thought

3864
01:08:41,669 --> 01:08:41,679
i thought
 

3865
01:08:41,679 --> 01:08:43,510
i thought
wrongly

3866
01:08:43,510 --> 01:08:43,520
wrongly
 

3867
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:45,189
wrongly
that we would have

3868
01:08:45,189 --> 01:08:45,199
that we would have
 

3869
01:08:45,199 --> 01:08:48,550
that we would have
special purpose lanes on 101

3870
01:08:48,550 --> 01:08:48,560
special purpose lanes on 101
 

3871
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:52,709
special purpose lanes on 101
in the bay area the the leftmost lane

3872
01:08:52,709 --> 01:08:52,719
in the bay area the the leftmost lane
 

3873
01:08:52,719 --> 01:08:55,910
in the bay area the the leftmost lane
so that it would be normal for

3874
01:08:55,910 --> 01:08:55,920
so that it would be normal for
 

3875
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:58,309
so that it would be normal for
teslas or other cars to move into that

3876
01:08:58,309 --> 01:08:58,319
teslas or other cars to move into that
 

3877
01:08:58,319 --> 01:09:00,229
teslas or other cars to move into that
lane and then say okay now it's

3878
01:09:00,229 --> 01:09:00,239
lane and then say okay now it's
 

3879
01:09:00,239 --> 01:09:03,269
lane and then say okay now it's
autonomous and have that dedicated lane

3880
01:09:03,269 --> 01:09:03,279
autonomous and have that dedicated lane
 

3881
01:09:03,279 --> 01:09:04,709
autonomous and have that dedicated lane
i was expecting

3882
01:09:04,709 --> 01:09:04,719
i was expecting
 

3883
01:09:04,719 --> 01:09:06,470
i was expecting
movement to that you know five years ago

3884
01:09:06,470 --> 01:09:06,480
movement to that you know five years ago
 

3885
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:07,829
movement to that you know five years ago
i was expecting we'd have a lot more

3886
01:09:07,829 --> 01:09:07,839
i was expecting we'd have a lot more
 

3887
01:09:07,839 --> 01:09:10,149
i was expecting we'd have a lot more
movement towards that we haven't and it

3888
01:09:10,149 --> 01:09:10,159
movement towards that we haven't and it
 

3889
01:09:10,159 --> 01:09:11,430
movement towards that we haven't and it
may be because

3890
01:09:11,430 --> 01:09:11,440
may be because
 

3891
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:13,590
may be because
tesla's been over promising by saying

3892
01:09:13,590 --> 01:09:13,600
tesla's been over promising by saying
 

3893
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:15,189
tesla's been over promising by saying
this you know calling their system fully

3894
01:09:15,189 --> 01:09:15,199
this you know calling their system fully
 

3895
01:09:15,199 --> 01:09:17,749
this you know calling their system fully
self-driving um i think they may have

3896
01:09:17,749 --> 01:09:17,759
self-driving um i think they may have
 

3897
01:09:17,759 --> 01:09:21,110
self-driving um i think they may have
been gotten there quicker by

3898
01:09:21,110 --> 01:09:21,120
been gotten there quicker by
 

3899
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:22,470
been gotten there quicker by
collaborating

3900
01:09:22,470 --> 01:09:22,480
collaborating
 

3901
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:25,829
collaborating
to change the infrastructure

3902
01:09:25,829 --> 01:09:25,839
to change the infrastructure
 

3903
01:09:25,839 --> 01:09:28,070
to change the infrastructure
this is one of the problems

3904
01:09:28,070 --> 01:09:28,080
this is one of the problems
 

3905
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:29,189
this is one of the problems
with

3906
01:09:29,189 --> 01:09:29,199
with
 

3907
01:09:29,199 --> 01:09:31,349
with
long-haul trucking

3908
01:09:31,349 --> 01:09:31,359
long-haul trucking
 

3909
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:33,430
long-haul trucking
being autonomous i think it makes sense

3910
01:09:33,430 --> 01:09:33,440
being autonomous i think it makes sense
 

3911
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:34,709
being autonomous i think it makes sense
on freeways

3912
01:09:34,709 --> 01:09:34,719
on freeways
 

3913
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:37,749
on freeways
at night for the trucks to go

3914
01:09:37,749 --> 01:09:37,759
at night for the trucks to go
 

3915
01:09:37,759 --> 01:09:39,829
at night for the trucks to go
autonomously um

3916
01:09:39,829 --> 01:09:39,839
autonomously um
 

3917
01:09:39,839 --> 01:09:41,669
autonomously um
but then is that how to get onto and off

3918
01:09:41,669 --> 01:09:41,679
but then is that how to get onto and off
 

3919
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:43,110
but then is that how to get onto and off
of the freeway what sort of

3920
01:09:43,110 --> 01:09:43,120
of the freeway what sort of
 

3921
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:45,189
of the freeway what sort of
infrastructure do you need for that

3922
01:09:45,189 --> 01:09:45,199
infrastructure do you need for that
 

3923
01:09:45,199 --> 01:09:47,110
infrastructure do you need for that
um do you need to have the human in

3924
01:09:47,110 --> 01:09:47,120
um do you need to have the human in
 

3925
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:48,390
um do you need to have the human in
there to do that

3926
01:09:48,390 --> 01:09:48,400
there to do that
 

3927
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:50,789
there to do that
or can you get rid of the human so i

3928
01:09:50,789 --> 01:09:50,799
or can you get rid of the human so i
 

3929
01:09:50,799 --> 01:09:52,789
or can you get rid of the human so i
think there's ways to get there but it's

3930
01:09:52,789 --> 01:09:52,799
think there's ways to get there but it's
 

3931
01:09:52,799 --> 01:09:54,470
think there's ways to get there but it's
an infrastructure

3932
01:09:54,470 --> 01:09:54,480
an infrastructure
 

3933
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:55,990
an infrastructure
argument

3934
01:09:55,990 --> 01:09:56,000
argument
 

3935
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,270
argument
because the long tail of cases

3936
01:09:59,270 --> 01:09:59,280
because the long tail of cases
 

3937
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:00,630
because the long tail of cases
is very long

3938
01:10:00,630 --> 01:10:00,640
is very long
 

3939
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:02,950
is very long
and the acceptance of it will not be at

3940
01:10:02,950 --> 01:10:02,960
and the acceptance of it will not be at
 

3941
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:06,149
and the acceptance of it will not be at
the same level as human drivers

3942
01:10:06,149 --> 01:10:06,159
the same level as human drivers
 

3943
01:10:06,159 --> 01:10:07,430
the same level as human drivers
so i'm

3944
01:10:07,430 --> 01:10:07,440
so i'm
 

3945
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:09,830
so i'm
i'm with you still and i was with you

3946
01:10:09,830 --> 01:10:09,840
i'm with you still and i was with you
 

3947
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:12,550
i'm with you still and i was with you
for a long time but i am surprised how

3948
01:10:12,550 --> 01:10:12,560
for a long time but i am surprised how
 

3949
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:15,590
for a long time but i am surprised how
how well how many edge cases

3950
01:10:15,590 --> 01:10:15,600
how well how many edge cases
 

3951
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:17,510
how well how many edge cases
of machine learning and vision based

3952
01:10:17,510 --> 01:10:17,520
of machine learning and vision based
 

3953
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:19,110
of machine learning and vision based
methods can cover

3954
01:10:19,110 --> 01:10:19,120
methods can cover
 

3955
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:20,870
methods can cover
this this is what i'm trying to get get

3956
01:10:20,870 --> 01:10:20,880
this this is what i'm trying to get get
 

3957
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:23,830
this this is what i'm trying to get get
at is um

3958
01:10:23,830 --> 01:10:23,840

 

3959
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:25,270

i think there's something fundamentally

3960
01:10:25,270 --> 01:10:25,280
i think there's something fundamentally
 

3961
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:28,149
i think there's something fundamentally
different with vision based methods and

3962
01:10:28,149 --> 01:10:28,159
different with vision based methods and
 

3963
01:10:28,159 --> 01:10:30,149
different with vision based methods and
tesla autopilot and any company that's

3964
01:10:30,149 --> 01:10:30,159
tesla autopilot and any company that's
 

3965
01:10:30,159 --> 01:10:31,910
tesla autopilot and any company that's
trying to do the same

3966
01:10:31,910 --> 01:10:31,920
trying to do the same
 

3967
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:33,590
trying to do the same
okay well i'm not i'm not going to argue

3968
01:10:33,590 --> 01:10:33,600
okay well i'm not i'm not going to argue
 

3969
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:35,750
okay well i'm not i'm not going to argue
with you because you know i

3970
01:10:35,750 --> 01:10:35,760
with you because you know i
 

3971
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:37,669
with you because you know i
i

3972
01:10:37,669 --> 01:10:37,679
i
 

3973
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:40,550
i
was speculating yes but i

3974
01:10:40,550 --> 01:10:40,560
was speculating yes but i
 

3975
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:43,270
was speculating yes but i
you know my gut feeling tells me

3976
01:10:43,270 --> 01:10:43,280
you know my gut feeling tells me
 

3977
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:46,470
you know my gut feeling tells me
it's going to be

3978
01:10:46,470 --> 01:10:46,480

 

3979
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:48,149

things will things will speed up when

3980
01:10:48,149 --> 01:10:48,159
things will things will speed up when
 

3981
01:10:48,159 --> 01:10:50,470
things will things will speed up when
there is engineering of the environment

3982
01:10:50,470 --> 01:10:50,480
there is engineering of the environment
 

3983
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:51,830
there is engineering of the environment
because that's what happened with every

3984
01:10:51,830 --> 01:10:51,840
because that's what happened with every
 

3985
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:53,189
because that's what happened with every
other technology

3986
01:10:53,189 --> 01:10:53,199
other technology
 

3987
01:10:53,199 --> 01:10:54,709
other technology
i'm a bit i don't know about you but i'm

3988
01:10:54,709 --> 01:10:54,719
i'm a bit i don't know about you but i'm
 

3989
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:56,950
i'm a bit i don't know about you but i'm
a bit cynical that

3990
01:10:56,950 --> 01:10:56,960
a bit cynical that
 

3991
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:59,510
a bit cynical that
infrastructure which relies on on

3992
01:10:59,510 --> 01:10:59,520
infrastructure which relies on on
 

3993
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:01,030
infrastructure which relies on on
government

3994
01:11:01,030 --> 01:11:01,040
government
 

3995
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:02,630
government
to help out

3996
01:11:02,630 --> 01:11:02,640
to help out
 

3997
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:04,790
to help out
in these cases um

3998
01:11:04,790 --> 01:11:04,800
in these cases um
 

3999
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:06,870
in these cases um
if you just look at infrastructure in

4000
01:11:06,870 --> 01:11:06,880
if you just look at infrastructure in
 

4001
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:09,189
if you just look at infrastructure in
all domains it's just a government

4002
01:11:09,189 --> 01:11:09,199
all domains it's just a government
 

4003
01:11:09,199 --> 01:11:11,430
all domains it's just a government
always drags behind on infrastructure

4004
01:11:11,430 --> 01:11:11,440
always drags behind on infrastructure
 

4005
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:13,990
always drags behind on infrastructure
there's like there's so many just well

4006
01:11:13,990 --> 01:11:14,000
there's like there's so many just well
 

4007
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,630
there's like there's so many just well
in this country in the future sorry yes

4008
01:11:16,630 --> 01:11:16,640
in this country in the future sorry yes
 

4009
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:18,470
in this country in the future sorry yes
in the in this country and and of course

4010
01:11:18,470 --> 01:11:18,480
in the in this country and and of course
 

4011
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:19,990
in the in this country and and of course
there's many many countries that are

4012
01:11:19,990 --> 01:11:20,000
there's many many countries that are
 

4013
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,990
there's many many countries that are
actually much worse on infrastructure oh

4014
01:11:21,990 --> 01:11:22,000
actually much worse on infrastructure oh
 

4015
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,350
actually much worse on infrastructure oh
yes there's nothing many are much worse

4016
01:11:23,350 --> 01:11:23,360
yes there's nothing many are much worse
 

4017
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:24,950
yes there's nothing many are much worse
and there's some that you know like

4018
01:11:24,950 --> 01:11:24,960
and there's some that you know like
 

4019
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:26,950
and there's some that you know like
high-speed rail the

4020
01:11:26,950 --> 01:11:26,960
high-speed rail the
 

4021
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:28,950
high-speed rail the
other countries have done much better i

4022
01:11:28,950 --> 01:11:28,960
other countries have done much better i
 

4023
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:31,189
other countries have done much better i
guess uh my question is like

4024
01:11:31,189 --> 01:11:31,199
guess uh my question is like
 

4025
01:11:31,199 --> 01:11:33,430
guess uh my question is like
which is at the core what i was trying

4026
01:11:33,430 --> 01:11:33,440
which is at the core what i was trying
 

4027
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:35,750
which is at the core what i was trying
to think through here and ask is like

4028
01:11:35,750 --> 01:11:35,760
to think through here and ask is like
 

4029
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:39,030
to think through here and ask is like
how hard is the driving problem

4030
01:11:39,030 --> 01:11:39,040
how hard is the driving problem
 

4031
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:41,350
how hard is the driving problem
as it currently stands so you mentioned

4032
01:11:41,350 --> 01:11:41,360
as it currently stands so you mentioned
 

4033
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:42,790
as it currently stands so you mentioned
like we don't want to just take the

4034
01:11:42,790 --> 01:11:42,800
like we don't want to just take the
 

4035
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,229
like we don't want to just take the
human out and duplicate whatever the

4036
01:11:44,229 --> 01:11:44,239
human out and duplicate whatever the
 

4037
01:11:44,239 --> 01:11:46,390
human out and duplicate whatever the
human was doing but if we were to try to

4038
01:11:46,390 --> 01:11:46,400
human was doing but if we were to try to
 

4039
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:48,870
human was doing but if we were to try to
do that

4040
01:11:48,870 --> 01:11:48,880

 

4041
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:49,750

what

4042
01:11:49,750 --> 01:11:49,760
what
 

4043
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:51,430
what
how hard is that problem

4044
01:11:51,430 --> 01:11:51,440
how hard is that problem
 

4045
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:55,350
how hard is that problem
because i used to think is way harder

4046
01:11:55,350 --> 01:11:55,360
because i used to think is way harder
 

4047
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:57,590
because i used to think is way harder
like i i used to think it's uh

4048
01:11:57,590 --> 01:11:57,600
like i i used to think it's uh
 

4049
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:00,550
like i i used to think it's uh
with vision alone it it it would be

4050
01:12:00,550 --> 01:12:00,560
with vision alone it it it would be
 

4051
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:02,950
with vision alone it it it would be
three decades four decades okay so i i

4052
01:12:02,950 --> 01:12:02,960
three decades four decades okay so i i
 

4053
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:05,110
three decades four decades okay so i i
don't know the answer to this thing i'm

4054
01:12:05,110 --> 01:12:05,120
don't know the answer to this thing i'm
 

4055
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:07,189
don't know the answer to this thing i'm
about to pose

4056
01:12:07,189 --> 01:12:07,199
about to pose
 

4057
01:12:07,199 --> 01:12:11,110
about to pose
but i do notice that on highway 280 here

4058
01:12:11,110 --> 01:12:11,120
but i do notice that on highway 280 here
 

4059
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:13,669
but i do notice that on highway 280 here
in the bay area which largely has

01:12:13,669 --> 01:12:13,679
in the bay area which largely has
 

4061
01:12:13,679 --> 01:12:15,030
in the bay area which largely has
concrete

the white lines that are painted there

4066
01:12:19,750 --> 01:12:19,760
the white lines that are painted there
 

4067
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:23,510
the white lines that are painted there
now have black boundaries around them

4068
01:12:23,510 --> 01:12:23,520
now have black boundaries around them
 

4069
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:24,709
now have black boundaries around them
and

4070
01:12:24,709 --> 01:12:24,719
and
 

4071
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:25,990
and
my

4072
01:12:25,990 --> 01:12:26,000
my
 

4073
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,310
my
lane drift system in my car would not

4074
01:12:28,310 --> 01:12:28,320
lane drift system in my car would not
 

4075
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:30,229
lane drift system in my car would not
work without those black boundaries

4076
01:12:30,229 --> 01:12:30,239
work without those black boundaries
 

4077
01:12:30,239 --> 01:12:31,910
work without those black boundaries
interesting so i don't know whether

4078
01:12:31,910 --> 01:12:31,920
interesting so i don't know whether
 

4079
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:33,910
interesting so i don't know whether
they've started doing it to help the

4080
01:12:33,910 --> 01:12:33,920
they've started doing it to help the
 

4081
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:36,709
they've started doing it to help the
lane drift whether it is an instance of

4082
01:12:36,709 --> 01:12:36,719
lane drift whether it is an instance of
 

4083

that change in the way they paint the

4090
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:45,120
that change in the way they paint the
 

4091
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:47,350
that change in the way they paint the
line unfortunately really good lane

4092
01:12:47,350 --> 01:12:47,360
line unfortunately really good lane
 

4093
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:48,550
line unfortunately really good lane
keeping

4094
01:12:48,550 --> 01:12:48,560
keeping
 

4095
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:50,390
keeping
is not as valuable

4096
01:12:50,390 --> 01:12:50,400
is not as valuable
 

4097
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:51,189
is not as valuable
like

4098
01:12:51,189 --> 01:12:51,199
like
 

4099
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:53,350
like
it's orders of magnitude more valuable

4100
01:12:53,350 --> 01:12:53,360
it's orders of magnitude more valuable
 

4101
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:55,510
it's orders of magnitude more valuable
to have a fully autonomous system like

4102
01:12:55,510 --> 01:12:55,520
to have a fully autonomous system like
 

4103
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:58,070
to have a fully autonomous system like
yeah but but for me

4104
01:12:58,070 --> 01:12:58,080
yeah but but for me
 

4105
01:12:58,080 --> 01:12:59,750
yeah but but for me
lane keeping is really helpful because

4106
01:12:59,750 --> 01:12:59,760
lane keeping is really helpful because
 

4107
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:02,550
lane keeping is really helpful because
i'm busy at it but you wouldn't pay

4108
01:13:02,550 --> 01:13:02,560
i'm busy at it but you wouldn't pay
 

4109
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:04,870
i'm busy at it but you wouldn't pay
10 times like

4110
01:13:04,870 --> 01:13:04,880
10 times like
 

4111
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:05,669
10 times like
um

4112
01:13:05,669 --> 01:13:05,679
um
 

4113
01:13:05,679 --> 01:13:07,669
um
the problem is there's not financial

4114
01:13:07,669 --> 01:13:07,679
the problem is there's not financial
 

4115
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:10,709
the problem is there's not financial
like it doesn't make sense to to to uh

4116
01:13:10,709 --> 01:13:10,719
like it doesn't make sense to to to uh
 

4117
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:13,350
like it doesn't make sense to to to uh
revamp the infrastructure to make lane

4118
01:13:13,350 --> 01:13:13,360
revamp the infrastructure to make lane
 

4119
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:14,790
revamp the infrastructure to make lane
keeping easier

4120
01:13:14,790 --> 01:13:14,800
keeping easier
 

4121
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:16,390
keeping easier
it does make sense to prevent the

4122
01:13:16,390 --> 01:13:16,400
it does make sense to prevent the
 

4123
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:18,310
it does make sense to prevent the
infrastructure if you have a large fleet

4124
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:18,320
infrastructure if you have a large fleet
 

4125
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:20,630
infrastructure if you have a large fleet
of autonomous vehicles now you change

4126
01:13:20,630 --> 01:13:20,640
of autonomous vehicles now you change
 

4127
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:22,790
of autonomous vehicles now you change
what it means to own cars you change the

4128
01:13:22,790 --> 01:13:22,800
what it means to own cars you change the
 

4129
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:25,590
what it means to own cars you change the
nature of transportation i mean but that

4130
01:13:25,590 --> 01:13:25,600
nature of transportation i mean but that
 

4131
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:27,750
nature of transportation i mean but that
that for that you need

4132
01:13:27,750 --> 01:13:27,760
that for that you need
 

4133
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:30,070
that for that you need
uh autonomous vehicles let me ask you

4134
01:13:30,070 --> 01:13:30,080
uh autonomous vehicles let me ask you
 

4135
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:32,630
uh autonomous vehicles let me ask you
about waymo then i've gotten a bunch of

4136
01:13:32,630 --> 01:13:32,640
about waymo then i've gotten a bunch of
 

4137
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:36,390
about waymo then i've gotten a bunch of
chances to to ride in in a waymo um

4138
01:13:36,390 --> 01:13:36,400
chances to to ride in in a waymo um
 

4139
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:38,310
chances to to ride in in a waymo um
self-driving car and they're

4140
01:13:38,310 --> 01:13:38,320
self-driving car and they're
 

4141
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:39,590
self-driving car and they're
i don't know if you'd call them

4142
01:13:39,590 --> 01:13:39,600
i don't know if you'd call them
 

4143
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:42,390
i don't know if you'd call them
self-driving but well i mean i i wrote

4144
01:13:42,390 --> 01:13:42,400
self-driving but well i mean i i wrote
 

4145
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:44,070
self-driving but well i mean i i wrote
in one before they were called waymo

4146
01:13:44,070 --> 01:13:44,080
in one before they were called waymo
 

4147
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:47,189
in one before they were called waymo
yeah still at x so there's currently

4148
01:13:47,189 --> 01:13:47,199
yeah still at x so there's currently
 

4149
01:13:47,199 --> 01:13:50,070
yeah still at x so there's currently
this was a big another surprising leap i

4150
01:13:50,070 --> 01:13:50,080
this was a big another surprising leap i
 

4151
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:51,590
this was a big another surprising leap i
didn't think it would happen which is

4152
01:13:51,590 --> 01:13:51,600
didn't think it would happen which is
 

4153
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:53,270
didn't think it would happen which is
they have no driver

4154
01:13:53,270 --> 01:13:53,280
they have no driver
 

4155
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:55,510
they have no driver
currently yeah in chandler in chandler

4156
01:13:55,510 --> 01:13:55,520
currently yeah in chandler in chandler
 

4157
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:57,510
currently yeah in chandler in chandler
arizona and i think they're thinking of

4158
01:13:57,510 --> 01:13:57,520
arizona and i think they're thinking of
 

4159
01:13:57,520 --> 01:13:59,510
arizona and i think they're thinking of
doing that in austin as well but they're

4160
01:13:59,510 --> 01:13:59,520
doing that in austin as well but they're
 

4161
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:01,270
doing that in austin as well but they're
they're expanding

4162
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:01,280
they're expanding
 

4163
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:03,590
they're expanding
although although you know and i i do an

4164
01:14:03,590 --> 01:14:03,600
although although you know and i i do an
 

4165
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:07,110
although although you know and i i do an
annual uh checkup on this so as of late

4166
01:14:07,110 --> 01:14:07,120
annual uh checkup on this so as of late
 

4167
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:09,590
annual uh checkup on this so as of late
last year they were aiming for hundreds

4168
01:14:09,590 --> 01:14:09,600
last year they were aiming for hundreds
 

4169
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:11,189
last year they were aiming for hundreds
of rides

4170
01:14:11,189 --> 01:14:11,199
of rides
 

4171
01:14:11,199 --> 01:14:12,470
of rides
a week

4172
01:14:12,470 --> 01:14:12,480
a week
 

4173
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:14,950
a week
not thousands and

01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:14,960
not thousands and
 

4175
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:17,590
not thousands and
um there is still no one in the car but

4176
01:14:17,590 --> 01:14:17,600
um there is still no one in the car but
 

4177
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:19,189
um there is still no one in the car but
there's certainly uh

4178
01:14:19,189 --> 01:14:19,199
there's certainly uh
 

4179
01:14:19,199 --> 01:14:23,350
there's certainly uh
um safety uh people in the loop and it's

4180
01:14:23,350 --> 01:14:23,360
um safety uh people in the loop and it's
 

4181
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:24,950
um safety uh people in the loop and it's
not clear how many you know what the

4182
01:14:24,950 --> 01:14:24,960
not clear how many you know what the
 

4183
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:27,430
not clear how many you know what the
ratio of cars to safety people is

4184
01:14:27,430 --> 01:14:27,440
ratio of cars to safety people is
 

4185
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:28,950
ratio of cars to safety people is
i it wasn't

4186
01:14:28,950 --> 01:14:28,960
i it wasn't
 

4187
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:31,270
i it wasn't
uh obviously they're not 100 transparent

4188
01:14:31,270 --> 01:14:31,280
uh obviously they're not 100 transparent
 

4189
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:32,790
uh obviously they're not 100 transparent
about this no none of them are 100

4190
01:14:32,790 --> 01:14:32,800
about this no none of them are 100

but i'd

4194
01:14:35,750 --> 01:14:35,760
but i'd
 

4195
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:37,830
but i'd
at least the way they're

4196
01:14:37,830 --> 01:14:37,840
at least the way they're
 

4197
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:39,189
at least the way they're
i don't want to make definitely but

4198
01:14:39,189 --> 01:14:39,199
i don't want to make definitely but
 

4199
01:14:39,199 --> 01:14:41,590
i don't want to make definitely but
they're saying there's no tele operation

4200
01:14:41,590 --> 01:14:41,600
they're saying there's no tele operation
 

4201
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:42,790
they're saying there's no tele operation
um

4202
01:14:42,790 --> 01:14:42,800
um
 

4203
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:45,030
um
like they're i mean

4204
01:14:45,030 --> 01:14:45,040
like they're i mean
 

4205
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:47,750
like they're i mean
okay and and and that sort of fits with

4206
01:14:47,750 --> 01:14:47,760
okay and and and that sort of fits with
 

4207
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:50,149

at least certainly the human side of
autonomous vehicles for many years and

4230
01:15:18,310 --> 01:15:18,320
autonomous vehicles for many years and
 

4231
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:20,550
autonomous vehicles for many years and
you've been doing it for way longer like

4232
01:15:20,550 --> 01:15:20,560
you've been doing it for way longer like
 

4233

that scale is a hundred cars this is not

4238
01:15:25,110 --> 01:15:25,120
that scale is a hundred cars this is not
 

4239
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:28,229

a demo this is not this is me as a
regular the argument i have is that

4242
01:15:30,630 --> 01:15:30,640
regular the argument i have is that
 

4243
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:33,030
regular the argument i have is that
people make interpolations from that

4244
01:15:33,030 --> 01:15:33,040
people make interpolations from that
 

4245
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:35,270
people make interpolations from that
interpolation that you know it's here

4246
01:15:35,270 --> 01:15:35,280
interpolation that you know it's here
 

4247
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:36,390
interpolation that you know it's here
it's done

4248
01:15:36,390 --> 01:15:36,400
it's done
 

4249
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:38,470
it's done
um you know it's just you know we've

4250
01:15:38,470 --> 01:15:38,480
um you know it's just you know we've
 

4251
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:41,030
um you know it's just you know we've
solved that no we haven't yet

4252
01:15:41,030 --> 01:15:41,040
solved that no we haven't yet
 

4253
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:43,350
solved that no we haven't yet
and and that's my argument okay so i'd

4254
01:15:43,350 --> 01:15:43,360
and and that's my argument okay so i'd
 

4255
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:44,630
and and that's my argument okay so i'd
like to go to

4256
01:15:44,630 --> 01:15:44,640
like to go to
 

4257
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:47,189
like to go to
you uh you keep a list of predictions

4258
01:15:47,189 --> 01:15:47,199
you uh you keep a list of predictions
 

4259
01:15:47,199 --> 01:15:49,030
you uh you keep a list of predictions
on your amazing blog post it'd be fun to

4260

you have a
harshness to you sometimes in your

01:15:59,430 --> 01:15:59,440
harshness to you sometimes in your
 

4271
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:06,550
harshness to you sometimes in your
criticisms of what is

4272
01:16:06,550 --> 01:16:06,560

 

4273
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:08,950

and so like because people extrapolate

4274
01:16:08,950 --> 01:16:08,960
and so like because people extrapolate
 

4275
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:10,870

into the hype and then they
 

4279
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:17,030
into the hype and then they
they kind of start to think that um

4280
01:16:17,030 --> 01:16:17,040
they kind of start to think that um
 

4281
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:19,270
they kind of start to think that um
uh the technology is way better than it

4282
01:16:19,270 --> 01:16:19,280
uh the technology is way better than it
 

4283
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:21,110
uh the technology is way better than it
is but

4284
01:16:21,110 --> 01:16:21,120

4531
01:20:38,239 --> 01:20:39,669
elon it's that he doesn't make
distinctions

4532
01:20:39,669 --> 01:20:39,679
distinctions
 

4533
01:20:39,679 --> 01:20:41,510
distinctions
between

4534
01:20:41,510 --> 01:20:41,520
between
 

4535
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:43,270
between
when the technology's

4536
01:20:43,270 --> 01:20:43,280
when the technology's
 

4537
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:45,669
when the technology's
coming along and ready and then he'll go

4538
01:20:45,669 --> 01:20:45,679
coming along and ready and then he'll go
 

4539
01:20:45,679 --> 01:20:46,950
coming along and ready and then he'll go
off and and

4540
01:20:46,950 --> 01:20:46,960
off and and
 

4541
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:49,030
off and and
mouth off about other things which then

4542
01:20:49,030 --> 01:20:49,040
mouth off about other things which then
 

4543
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:50,870
mouth off about other things which then
people go and compete about and try and

4544
01:20:50,870 --> 01:20:50,880
people go and compete about and try and
 

4545
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:51,669
people go and compete about and try and
do

4546
01:20:51,669 --> 01:20:51,679
do
 

4547
01:20:51,679 --> 01:20:53,430
do
and

4548
01:20:53,430 --> 01:20:53,440
and
 

4549
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:54,229
and
so

4550
01:20:54,229 --> 01:20:54,239
so
 

4551
01:20:54,239 --> 01:20:56,950
so
this is where i um i i understand what

4552
01:20:56,950 --> 01:20:56,960
this is where i um i i understand what
 

4553
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:58,790
this is where i um i i understand what
you're saying i tend to draw a different

4554
01:20:58,790 --> 01:20:58,800
you're saying i tend to draw a different
 

4555
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:00,870
you're saying i tend to draw a different
distinction i

4556
01:21:00,870 --> 01:21:00,880
distinction i
 

4557
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:01,990
distinction i
i have

4558
01:21:01,990 --> 01:21:02,000
i have
 

4559
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,750
i have
a similar kind of harshness towards

4560
01:21:03,750 --> 01:21:03,760
a similar kind of harshness towards
 

4561
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:05,990
a similar kind of harshness towards
people who are not telling the truth

4562
01:21:05,990 --> 01:21:06,000
people who are not telling the truth
 

4563
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,030
people who are not telling the truth

who are
 

4565
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:08,870
who are
basically fabricating stuff to make

4566
01:21:08,870 --> 01:21:08,880
basically fabricating stuff to make
 

4567
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:11,189
basically fabricating stuff to make
money or to well he believes what he

4568
01:21:11,189 --> 01:21:11,199
money or to well he believes what he
 

4569
01:21:11,199 --> 01:21:12,950
money or to well he believes what he
says i just think to me that's a very

4570
01:21:12,950 --> 01:21:12,960
says i just think to me that's a very
 

4571
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:15,189
says i just think to me that's a very
important difference yeah i'm not

4572
01:21:15,189 --> 01:21:15,199
important difference yeah i'm not
 

4573
01:21:15,199 --> 01:21:17,910
important difference yeah i'm not
because i think uh in order to fly

4574
01:21:17,910 --> 01:21:17,920
because i think uh in order to fly
 

4575
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:19,270
because i think uh in order to fly
in order to get to the moon you have to

4576
01:21:19,270 --> 01:21:19,280
in order to get to the moon you have to
 

4577
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:22,870
in order to get to the moon you have to
believe um even when uh most people tell

4578
01:21:22,870 --> 01:21:22,880
believe um even when uh most people tell
 

4579
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:24,790
believe um even when uh most people tell
you you're wrong and most likely you're

4580
01:21:24,790 --> 01:21:24,800
you you're wrong and most likely you're
 

4581
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:27,350
you you're wrong and most likely you're
wrong but sometimes you're right i mean

4582
01:21:27,350 --> 01:21:27,360
wrong but sometimes you're right i mean
 

4583
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:28,870
wrong but sometimes you're right i mean
that's the same thing i have with tesla

4584
01:21:28,870 --> 01:21:28,880
that's the same thing i have with tesla
 

4585
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:30,950
that's the same thing i have with tesla
autopilot i i think that's an

4586
01:21:30,950 --> 01:21:30,960
autopilot i i think that's an
 

4587
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:33,110
autopilot i i think that's an
interesting one i was especially when i

4588
01:21:33,110 --> 01:21:33,120
interesting one i was especially when i
 

4589
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:36,310
interesting one i was especially when i
was you know um at mit and just the

4590
01:21:36,310 --> 01:21:36,320
was you know um at mit and just the
 

4591
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:37,910
was you know um at mit and just the
entire human factors in the robotics

4592
01:21:37,910 --> 01:21:37,920
entire human factors in the robotics
 

4593
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:39,910
entire human factors in the robotics
community were very negative towards

4594
01:21:39,910 --> 01:21:39,920
community were very negative towards
 

4595
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:41,510
community were very negative towards
elon it was very interesting for me to

4596
01:21:41,510 --> 01:21:41,520
elon it was very interesting for me to
 

4597
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:45,030
elon it was very interesting for me to
observe colleagues at mit

4598
01:21:45,030 --> 01:21:45,040
observe colleagues at mit
 

4599
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:46,790
observe colleagues at mit
i wasn't sure what to make of that that

4600
01:21:46,790 --> 01:21:46,800
i wasn't sure what to make of that that
 

4601
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:48,390
i wasn't sure what to make of that that
was very upsetting to me

4602
01:21:48,390 --> 01:21:48,400
was very upsetting to me
 

4603
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:50,310
was very upsetting to me
because i understood where that where

4604
01:21:50,310 --> 01:21:50,320
because i understood where that where
 

4605
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:51,910
because i understood where that where
that's coming from

4606
01:21:51,910 --> 01:21:51,920
that's coming from
 

4607
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:53,669
that's coming from
and i agreed with them and i kind of

4608
01:21:53,669 --> 01:21:53,679
and i agreed with them and i kind of
 

4609
01:21:53,679 --> 01:21:55,350
and i agreed with them and i kind of
almost felt the same thing in the

4610
01:21:55,350 --> 01:21:55,360
almost felt the same thing in the
 

4611
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:57,910
almost felt the same thing in the
beginning until i kind of opened my eyes

4612
01:21:57,910 --> 01:21:57,920
beginning until i kind of opened my eyes
 

4613
01:21:57,920 --> 01:21:59,030
beginning until i kind of opened my eyes
and and

4614
01:21:59,030 --> 01:21:59,040
and and
 

4615
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:00,470
and and
realized there's a lot of interesting

4616
01:22:00,470 --> 01:22:00,480
realized there's a lot of interesting
 

4617
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:02,629
realized there's a lot of interesting
ideas here there might be over hype you

4618
01:22:02,629 --> 01:22:02,639
ideas here there might be over hype you
 

4619
01:22:02,639 --> 01:22:03,510
ideas here there might be over hype you
know

4620
01:22:03,510 --> 01:22:03,520
know
 

4621
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:05,830
know
if if you focus yourself on the idea

4622
01:22:05,830 --> 01:22:05,840
if if you focus yourself on the idea
 

4623
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:07,830
if if you focus yourself on the idea
that

4624
01:22:07,830 --> 01:22:07,840
that
 

4625
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:09,430
that
you shouldn't call a system full

4626
01:22:09,430 --> 01:22:09,440
you shouldn't call a system full
 

4627
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:10,870
you shouldn't call a system full
self-driving

4628

4629
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:12,950
self-driving
when it's obviously not

4630
01:22:12,950 --> 01:22:12,960
when it's obviously not

you're going to miss the magic oh

4634
01:22:17,669 --> 01:22:17,679
you're going to miss the magic oh
 

4635
01:22:17,679 --> 01:22:19,270
you're going to miss the magic oh
yeah you are going to miss the magic but

4636
01:22:19,270 --> 01:22:19,280
yeah you are going to miss the magic but
 

4637
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:21,510
yeah you are going to miss the magic but
at the same time there are people who

4638
01:22:21,510 --> 01:22:21,520
at the same time there are people who
 

4639
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:23,030
at the same time there are people who
buy it

4640
01:22:23,030 --> 01:22:23,040
buy it
 

4641
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:25,350
buy it
literally pay money for it yeah and take

4642
01:22:25,350 --> 01:22:25,360
literally pay money for it yeah and take
 

4643
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:29,189
literally pay money for it yeah and take
those words as given so it's that's uh

that i
take words as given as one thing i

4650
01:22:33,590 --> 01:22:33,600
take words as given as one thing i
 

4651
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,830
take words as given as one thing i
haven't actually seen people that use

4652
01:22:35,830 --> 01:22:35,840
haven't actually seen people that use
 

4653
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:37,990
haven't actually seen people that use
autopilot that believe that the behavior

4654
01:22:37,990 --> 01:22:38,000
autopilot that believe that the behavior
 

4655
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,310
autopilot that believe that the behavior
is really important like the actual

4656
01:22:40,310 --> 01:22:40,320
is really important like the actual
 

4657
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:43,590
is really important like the actual
action so like this is like to push back

4658
01:22:43,590 --> 01:22:43,600
action so like this is like to push back
 

4659
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:45,270
action so like this is like to push back
on the very thing that you're frustrated

4660
01:22:45,270 --> 01:22:45,280
on the very thing that you're frustrated
 

4661
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:46,870
on the very thing that you're frustrated
about which is like journalists in

01:22:46,870 --> 01:22:46,880
about which is like journalists in
 

4663
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:48,070
about which is like journalists in
general people

4664
01:22:48,070 --> 01:22:48,080
general people
 

4665
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:48,870
general people
uh

4666
01:22:48,870 --> 01:22:48,880
uh
 

4667
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:51,189
uh
buying all the hype and going on

4668
01:22:51,189 --> 01:22:51,199
buying all the hype and going on
 

4669
01:22:51,199 --> 01:22:52,470

i think there's a lot of hype about
 

4673
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:57,030
i think there's a lot of hype about
the the negatives of this too that

4674
01:22:57,030 --> 01:22:57,040
the the negatives of this too that
 

4675
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:58,709
the the negatives of this too that
people are buying without using people

4676
01:22:58,709 --> 01:22:58,719
people are buying without using people
 

4677
01:22:58,719 --> 01:23:01,350
people are buying without using people
used the way this is what this was this

4678
01:23:01,350 --> 01:23:01,360
used the way this is what this was this
 

4679
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:03,110
used the way this is what this was this
opened my eyes actually

4680
01:23:03,110 --> 01:23:03,120
opened my eyes actually
 

4681
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:05,350
opened my eyes actually
the way people use the product is very

4682
01:23:05,350 --> 01:23:05,360
the way people use the product is very
 

4683
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:06,870
the way people use the product is very
different than the way

4684
01:23:06,870 --> 01:23:06,880
different than the way
 

4685
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,470
different than the way
they talk about it this is true with

4686
01:23:08,470 --> 01:23:08,480
they talk about it this is true with
 

4687
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:09,990
they talk about it this is true with
robotics with everything everybody has

4688
01:23:09,990 --> 01:23:10,000
robotics with everything everybody has
 

4689
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,310
robotics with everything everybody has
dreams of how a particular product might

4690
01:23:12,310 --> 01:23:12,320
dreams of how a particular product might
 

4691
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:14,790
dreams of how a particular product might
be used or so on this and then when it

4692

4693
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:16,709

meets reality there's a lot of fear of
 

4695
01:23:16,719 --> 01:23:18,790
meets reality there's a lot of fear of
robotics for example that robots are

robotics for example that robots are
 

4697
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:20,310
robotics for example that robots are
somehow dangerous and all those kinds of

4698
01:23:20,310 --> 01:23:20,320
somehow dangerous and all those kinds of
 

4699
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:22,070
somehow dangerous and all those kinds of
things but when you actually have robots

the system it was obvious it's unlikely
 

4787
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:50,950
the system it was obvious it's unlikely
to hit those

4788
01:24:50,950 --> 01:24:50,960
to hit those
 

4789
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:53,669

i think
that

4798

01:25:56,480 --> 01:26:00,149
i i i tend to be
maybe i'm naive but i i tend to believe

4856
01:26:00,149 --> 01:26:00,159
maybe i'm naive but i i tend to believe
 

4857
01:26:00,159 --> 01:26:01,590
maybe i'm naive but i i tend to believe
uh that

4858
01:26:01,590 --> 01:26:01,600
uh that
 

4859
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:03,669
uh that
like engineers innovators people like

4860
01:26:03,669 --> 01:26:03,679
like engineers innovators people like
 

4861
01:26:03,679 --> 01:26:05,430
like engineers innovators people like
that they're not

4862
01:26:05,430 --> 01:26:05,440
that they're not
 

4863
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:07,430
that they're not
they're my they don't think like that

4864
01:26:07,430 --> 01:26:07,440
they're my they don't think like that
 

4865
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:09,110
they're my they don't think like that
like manipulating the price at the stock

4866
01:26:09,110 --> 01:26:09,120
like manipulating the price at the stock
 

4867
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:10,550
like manipulating the price at the stock
price but

4868
01:26:10,550 --> 01:26:10,560
price but
 

4869
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:12,950
price but
it's possible that i'm uh i'm certain

4870
01:26:12,950 --> 01:26:12,960
it's possible that i'm uh i'm certain
 

4871
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:15,189
it's possible that i'm uh i'm certain
it's possible that i'm wrong

4872
01:26:15,189 --> 01:26:15,199
it's possible that i'm wrong
 

4873
01:26:15,199 --> 01:26:17,990
it's possible that i'm wrong
i it's a very cynical view of the world

4874
01:26:17,990 --> 01:26:18,000
i it's a very cynical view of the world
 

4875
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,550
i it's a very cynical view of the world
because i don't i think most people that

4876
01:26:20,550 --> 01:26:20,560
because i don't i think most people that
 

4877
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:23,350
because i don't i think most people that
run companies and build like especially

4878
01:26:23,350 --> 01:26:23,360
run companies and build like especially
 

4879
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:25,830

original founders
 

4881
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:28,149
original founders
they um yeah i'm not saying that's the

4882
01:26:28,149 --> 01:26:28,159
they um yeah i'm not saying that's the
 

4883
01:26:28,159 --> 01:26:30,310
they um yeah i'm not saying that's the
intent i'm saying it's a eventually it's

4884
01:26:30,310 --> 01:26:30,320
intent i'm saying it's a eventually it's
 

4885
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:32,390
intent i'm saying it's a eventually it's
kind of you uh yeah

4886
01:26:32,390 --> 01:26:32,400
kind of you uh yeah
 

4887
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:34,470
kind of you uh yeah
you you fall into that kind of a

4888
01:26:34,470 --> 01:26:34,480
you you fall into that kind of a
 

4889
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:36,070
you you fall into that kind of a
behavior pattern i don't know i i tend

4890
01:26:36,070 --> 01:26:36,080
behavior pattern i don't know i i tend
 

4891
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:37,030
behavior pattern i don't know i i tend
to

4892
01:26:37,030 --> 01:26:37,040
to
 

4893
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:38,229
to
i wasn't saying i wasn't saying it's

4894

i wasn't saying i wasn't saying it's
 

4895
01:26:38,239 --> 01:26:40,709
i wasn't saying i wasn't saying it's
falling into that intent it's just a

01:26:45,590 --> 01:26:45,600
this in this market yeah
 

4901
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:47,510
this in this market yeah
okay so you have first of all you have

4902
01:26:47,510 --> 01:26:47,520
okay so you have first of all you have
 

4903

okay so you have first of all you have
an amazing blog that people should check

4904
01:26:49,910 --> 01:26:49,920
an amazing blog that people should check
 

4905
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:52,470
an amazing blog that people should check
out but you also have this in that blog

4906
01:26:52,470 --> 01:26:52,480
out but you also have this in that blog
 

4907
01:26:52,480 --> 01:26:54,629
out but you also have this in that blog
a set of predictions

4908
01:26:54,629 --> 01:26:54,639
a set of predictions
 

4909
01:26:54,639 --> 01:26:56,390
a set of predictions
it's such a cool idea i don't know how

4910
01:26:56,390 --> 01:26:56,400
it's such a cool idea i don't know how
 

4911
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:57,750
it's such a cool idea i don't know how
long ago you started like three four

4912
01:26:57,750 --> 01:26:57,760
long ago you started like three four
 

4913
01:26:57,760 --> 01:27:00,350
long ago you started like three four
years ago it was um january 1st

4914
01:27:00,350 --> 01:27:00,360
years ago it was um january 1st
 

4915
01:27:00,360 --> 01:27:04,070
years ago it was um january 1st
2018 18. yeah and i made these

4916
01:27:04,070 --> 01:27:04,080
2018 18. yeah and i made these
 

4917
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:05,830
2018 18. yeah and i made these
predictions and i said that every

4918
01:27:05,830 --> 01:27:05,840
predictions and i said that every
 

4919
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:07,910
predictions and i said that every
january 1st i was going to check back on

4920
01:27:07,910 --> 01:27:07,920
january 1st i was going to check back on
 

4921
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:09,510
january 1st i was going to check back on
how my predictions would be that's such

4922
01:27:09,510 --> 01:27:09,520
how my predictions would be that's such
 

4923
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:11,910
how my predictions would be that's such
a great orthodontics for 32 years

4924
01:27:11,910 --> 01:27:11,920
a great orthodontics for 32 years
 

4925
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:14,149
a great orthodontics for 32 years
oh you said 32 years i said 32 years

4926
01:27:14,149 --> 01:27:14,159
oh you said 32 years i said 32 years
 

4927
01:27:14,159 --> 01:27:15,430
oh you said 32 years i said 32 years
because it's still that'll be january

4928
01:27:15,430 --> 01:27:15,440
because it's still that'll be january
 

4929
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:18,550
because it's still that'll be january
1st 2050 yeah i'll be

4930
01:27:18,550 --> 01:27:18,560
1st 2050 yeah i'll be
 

4931
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:22,790
1st 2050 yeah i'll be
i will just turn 95

4932
01:27:22,790 --> 01:27:22,800

 

4933
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:25,750

um

4934
01:27:25,750 --> 01:27:25,760

 

4935
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:27,590

you know so

4936
01:27:27,590 --> 01:27:27,600
you know so
 

4937
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:29,830
you know so
and so people know that your predictions

4938
01:27:29,830 --> 01:27:29,840
and so people know that your predictions
 

4939
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:31,750
and so people know that your predictions
at least for now are in the space of

4940
01:27:31,750 --> 01:27:31,760
at least for now are in the space of
 

4941
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:33,590
at least for now are in the space of
artificial intelligence yeah i didn't

4942
01:27:33,590 --> 01:27:33,600
artificial intelligence yeah i didn't
 

4943
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:34,870
artificial intelligence yeah i didn't
say i was going to make new predictions

4944
01:27:34,870 --> 01:27:34,880
say i was going to make new predictions
 

4945
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:36,070
say i was going to make new predictions
i was just going to measure this set of

4946
01:27:36,070 --> 01:27:36,080
i was just going to measure this set of
 

4947
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:37,430
i was just going to measure this set of
predictions that i made because yeah it

4948
01:27:37,430 --> 01:27:37,440
predictions that i made because yeah it
 

4949
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:39,350
predictions that i made because yeah it
was sort of i was sort of annoyed that

4950
01:27:39,350 --> 01:27:39,360
was sort of i was sort of annoyed that
 

4951
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:40,790
was sort of i was sort of annoyed that
everyone could make predictions they

4952
01:27:40,790 --> 01:27:40,800
everyone could make predictions they
 

4953
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:42,950
everyone could make predictions they
didn't come true and everyone forgot so

4954
01:27:42,950 --> 01:27:42,960
didn't come true and everyone forgot so
 

4955
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:44,870
didn't come true and everyone forgot so
i should hold myself to a high standard

4956
01:27:44,870 --> 01:27:44,880
i should hold myself to a high standard
 

4957
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:46,870
i should hold myself to a high standard
yeah but also just putting years and

4958
01:27:46,870 --> 01:27:46,880
yeah but also just putting years and
 

4959
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:49,189
yeah but also just putting years and
like date rangers on things it's a good

4960
01:27:49,189 --> 01:27:49,199
like date rangers on things it's a good
 

4961
01:27:49,199 --> 01:27:51,350
like date rangers on things it's a good
thought exercise yeah like and like

4962
01:27:51,350 --> 01:27:51,360
thought exercise yeah like and like
 

4963
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:53,430
thought exercise yeah like and like
reasoning your thoughts out and so the

4964
01:27:53,430 --> 01:27:53,440
reasoning your thoughts out and so the
 

4965
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:54,709
reasoning your thoughts out and so the
topics are

4966
01:27:54,709 --> 01:27:54,719
topics are
 

4967
01:27:54,719 --> 01:27:56,709
topics are
uh artificial intelligence autonomous

4968
01:27:56,709 --> 01:27:56,719
uh artificial intelligence autonomous
 

4969
01:27:56,719 --> 01:27:59,430
uh artificial intelligence autonomous
vehicles and space yeah

4970
01:27:59,430 --> 01:27:59,440
vehicles and space yeah
 

4971
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:00,870
vehicles and space yeah
um

4972
01:28:00,870 --> 01:28:00,880
um
 

4973
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:02,629
um
i was wondering if we could just go

4974
01:28:02,629 --> 01:28:02,639
i was wondering if we could just go
 

4975
01:28:02,639 --> 01:28:04,390
i was wondering if we could just go
through some that stand out maybe from

4976
01:28:04,390 --> 01:28:04,400
through some that stand out maybe from
 

4977
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:06,070
through some that stand out maybe from
memory i can just mention to you some

4978
01:28:06,070 --> 01:28:06,080
memory i can just mention to you some
 

4979
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:08,229
memory i can just mention to you some
let's talk about self-driving cars like

4980
01:28:08,229 --> 01:28:08,239
let's talk about self-driving cars like
 

4981
01:28:08,239 --> 01:28:09,830
let's talk about self-driving cars like
some predictions that you're

4982
01:28:09,830 --> 01:28:09,840
some predictions that you're
 

4983
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:12,390
some predictions that you're
particularly proud of or are

4984
01:28:12,390 --> 01:28:12,400
particularly proud of or are
 

4985
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:15,510
particularly proud of or are
particularly interesting uh from flying

4986
01:28:15,510 --> 01:28:15,520
particularly interesting uh from flying
 

4987
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:19,590
particularly interesting uh from flying
cars to the the other element here is

4988
01:28:19,590 --> 01:28:19,600
cars to the the other element here is
 

4989
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:22,470
cars to the the other element here is
like how widespread the location

4990
01:28:22,470 --> 01:28:22,480
like how widespread the location
 

4991
01:28:22,480 --> 01:28:24,070
like how widespread the location
where the deployment of the autonomous

4992
01:28:24,070 --> 01:28:24,080
where the deployment of the autonomous
 

4993
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:25,910
where the deployment of the autonomous
vehicles is

4994
01:28:25,910 --> 01:28:25,920
vehicles is
 

4995
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:27,669
vehicles is
and there's also just a few fun ones is

4996
01:28:27,669 --> 01:28:27,679
and there's also just a few fun ones is
 

4997
01:28:27,679 --> 01:28:28,950
and there's also just a few fun ones is
there something that jumps to mind that

4998
01:28:28,950 --> 01:28:28,960
there something that jumps to mind that
 

4999
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:31,990
there something that jumps to mind that
you remember from the predictions

5000
01:28:31,990 --> 01:28:32,000
you remember from the predictions
 

5001
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,669
you remember from the predictions
well i did i think i did put in there

5002
01:28:33,669 --> 01:28:33,679
well i did i think i did put in there
 

5003
01:28:33,679 --> 01:28:35,430
well i did i think i did put in there
that there would be a

5004
01:28:35,430 --> 01:28:35,440
that there would be a
 

5005
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:38,709
that there would be a
dedicated self-driving lane on 101 by

5006
01:28:38,709 --> 01:28:38,719
dedicated self-driving lane on 101 by
 

5007
01:28:38,719 --> 01:28:40,390
dedicated self-driving lane on 101 by
some year and i think i was over

5008
01:28:40,390 --> 01:28:40,400
some year and i think i was over
 

5009
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:42,870
some year and i think i was over
optimistic on that one yeah actually

5010
01:28:42,870 --> 01:28:42,880
optimistic on that one yeah actually
 

5011

delivery trucks stopping everywhere
 

5093
01:30:12,159 --> 01:30:15,590
delivery trucks stopping everywhere
which made things more complicated

5094
01:30:15,590 --> 01:30:15,600
which made things more complicated
 

5095
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:20,149
which made things more complicated

there waiting for a long time
 

5143
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:16,950
there waiting for a long time
and clearly something's going on where

01:31:16,950 --> 01:31:16,960
and clearly something's going on where
 

5145
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:20,390
and clearly something's going on where
the home office is making a decision um

the home office is making a decision um
 

5147
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:23,590
the home office is making a decision um
so they're you know and and so you can

5148
01:31:23,590 --> 01:31:23,600
so they're you know and and so you can
 

5149
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:24,709
so they're you know and and so you can
see whether they've got their hands on

5150
01:31:24,709 --> 01:31:24,719
see whether they've got their hands on
 

5151
01:31:24,719 --> 01:31:27,510
see whether they've got their hands on
the wheel or not and and it's the

5152
01:31:27,510 --> 01:31:27,520
the wheel or not and and it's the
 

5153
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:29,910
the wheel or not and and it's the
incident resolution time that tells you

5154
01:31:29,910 --> 01:31:29,920
incident resolution time that tells you
 

5155
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:31,350
incident resolution time that tells you
gives you some clues

5156
01:31:31,350 --> 01:31:31,360
gives you some clues
 

5157
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:33,189
gives you some clues
so what year do you think what's your

5158
01:31:33,189 --> 01:31:33,199
so what year do you think what's your
 

5159
01:31:33,199 --> 01:31:35,189
so what year do you think what's your
intuition what date range are you

5160
01:31:35,189 --> 01:31:35,199
intuition what date range are you
 

5161
01:31:35,199 --> 01:31:36,629
intuition what date range are you
currently thinking

5162
01:31:36,629 --> 01:31:36,639
currently thinking
 

5163
01:31:36,639 --> 01:31:39,669

are you are you still
 

5175
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:51,590
are you are you still
are you thinking uh 10 years from now 20

5176
01:31:51,590 --> 01:31:51,600
are you thinking uh 10 years from now 20
 

5177
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:53,030
are you thinking uh 10 years from now 20
years from now 30 years from now

5178
01:31:53,030 --> 01:31:53,040
years from now 30 years from now
 

5179
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:55,510
years from now 30 years from now
certainly not 10 years from now

5180
01:31:55,510 --> 01:31:55,520
certainly not 10 years from now
 

5181
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:57,189
certainly not 10 years from now
it's going to be longer if you're

5182
01:31:57,189 --> 01:31:57,199
it's going to be longer if you're
 

5183
01:31:57,199 --> 01:31:59,510
it's going to be longer if you're
allowed to go south of market way longer

5184
01:31:59,510 --> 01:31:59,520
allowed to go south of market way longer
 

5185
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:00,470
allowed to go south of market way longer
um

5186
01:32:00,470 --> 01:32:00,480
um
 

5187
01:32:00,480 --> 01:32:03,110
um
and unless it's re-engineering of course

5188
01:32:03,110 --> 01:32:03,120
and unless it's re-engineering of course
 

5189

roads
 

5191
01:32:04,239 --> 01:32:05,669
roads
by the way what's the biggest challenge

5192
01:32:05,669 --> 01:32:05,679
by the way what's the biggest challenge
 

5193
01:32:05,679 --> 01:32:08,629
by the way what's the biggest challenge
you can mention a few is that the the is

5194
01:32:08,629 --> 01:32:08,639
you can mention a few is that the the is
 

5195

you can mention a few is that the the is
it the delivery trucks is it the edge

5196
01:32:10,950 --> 01:32:10,960
it the delivery trucks is it the edge
 

5197
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:12,950
it the delivery trucks is it the edge
case is the computer perception

5198
01:32:12,950 --> 01:32:12,960
case is the computer perception
 

5199
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:14,470
case is the computer perception
uh well

5200
01:32:14,470 --> 01:32:14,480
uh well
 

5201
01:32:14,480 --> 01:32:15,910
uh well
here's a case that i saw outside my

stopped dead
covering the crosswalk why did it stop

5220
01:32:34,470 --> 01:32:34,480
covering the crosswalk why did it stop
 

5221
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:36,390
covering the crosswalk why did it stop
dead because there was a

5222
01:32:36,390 --> 01:32:36,400
dead because there was a
 

5223
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:39,350
dead because there was a
human just two feet from it

happening the human
was it was a woman was at the door of

01:32:45,189 --> 01:32:45,199
was it was a woman was at the door of
 

5231
01:32:45,199 --> 01:32:47,590
was it was a woman was at the door of
her car trying to unlock it with one of

5232
01:32:47,590 --> 01:32:47,600
her car trying to unlock it with one of
 

5233
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:48,870
her car trying to unlock it with one of
those things that yeah you know when you

5234
01:32:48,870 --> 01:32:48,880
those things that yeah you know when you
 

5235
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:50,550
those things that yeah you know when you
don't have a key yes

5236
01:32:50,550 --> 01:32:50,560
don't have a key yes
 

5237
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:51,669
don't have a key yes
that car

5238
01:32:51,669 --> 01:32:51,679
that car
 

5239
01:32:51,679 --> 01:32:52,629
that car
thought

5240
01:32:52,629 --> 01:32:52,639
thought
 

5241
01:32:52,639 --> 01:32:54,470
thought
oh she could jump out in front of me any

5242
01:32:54,470 --> 01:32:54,480
oh she could jump out in front of me any
 

5243
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:56,870
oh she could jump out in front of me any
second yeah as a human i could tell no

5244
01:32:56,870 --> 01:32:56,880
second yeah as a human i could tell no
 

5245
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:58,390
second yeah as a human i could tell no
she's not going to jump out she's busy

5246
01:32:58,390 --> 01:32:58,400
she's not going to jump out she's busy
 

5247
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:00,229
she's not going to jump out she's busy
trying to unlock her she's lost her keys

5248
01:33:00,229 --> 01:33:00,239
trying to unlock her she's lost her keys
 

5249
01:33:00,239 --> 01:33:01,750
trying to unlock her she's lost her keys
she's trying to get in the car

5250
01:33:01,750 --> 01:33:01,760
she's trying to get in the car
 

5251
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:04,310
she's trying to get in the car
and it it stayed there for

5252
01:33:04,310 --> 01:33:04,320
and it it stayed there for
 

5253
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:08,790
and it it stayed there for
until i got bored um yeah

5254
01:33:08,790 --> 01:33:08,800
until i got bored um yeah
 

5255
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:10,790
until i got bored um yeah
and so the the human driver in there did

5256
01:33:10,790 --> 01:33:10,800
and so the the human driver in there did
 

5257
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:12,870
and so the the human driver in there did
not take over

5258
01:33:12,870 --> 01:33:12,880
not take over
 

5259
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:15,189
not take over
but here's the kicker to me

5260
01:33:15,189 --> 01:33:15,199
but here's the kicker to me
 

5261
01:33:15,199 --> 01:33:17,669
but here's the kicker to me
a guy comes down the hill

5262
01:33:17,669 --> 01:33:17,679
a guy comes down the hill
 

5263
01:33:17,679 --> 01:33:19,590
a guy comes down the hill
with a stroller i assume there's a baby

5264
01:33:19,590 --> 01:33:19,600
with a stroller i assume there's a baby
 

5265
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:20,830
with a stroller i assume there's a baby
in there

5266
01:33:20,830 --> 01:33:20,840
in there
 

5267
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:22,550
in there
and

5268
01:33:22,550 --> 01:33:22,560
and
 

5269
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:24,950
and
now the crosswalk's blocked by this

5270
01:33:24,950 --> 01:33:24,960
now the crosswalk's blocked by this
 

5271
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:26,709
now the crosswalk's blocked by this
cruise vehicle

5272
01:33:26,709 --> 01:33:26,719
cruise vehicle
 

5273
01:33:26,719 --> 01:33:28,070
cruise vehicle
what's he going to do

5274
01:33:28,070 --> 01:33:28,080
what's he going to do
 

5275
01:33:28,080 --> 01:33:30,149
what's he going to do
cleverly i think he decided not to go in

5276
01:33:30,149 --> 01:33:30,159
cleverly i think he decided not to go in
 

5277
01:33:30,159 --> 01:33:33,110
cleverly i think he decided not to go in
front of the car

5278
01:33:33,110 --> 01:33:33,120

 

5279
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:35,030

he went but he had to go behind it he

5280
01:33:35,030 --> 01:33:35,040
he went but he had to go behind it he
 

5281
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:36,870
he went but he had to go behind it he
had to get off the crosswalk out into

5282
01:33:36,870 --> 01:33:36,880
had to get off the crosswalk out into
 

5283
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:38,070
had to get off the crosswalk out into
the intersection

5284
01:33:38,070 --> 01:33:38,080
the intersection
 

5285
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:40,390
the intersection
to push his baby around this car which

5286
01:33:40,390 --> 01:33:40,400
to push his baby around this car which
 

5287
01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:42,229
to push his baby around this car which
was stopped there and no human driver

5288
01:33:42,229 --> 01:33:42,239
was stopped there and no human driver
 

5289
01:33:42,239 --> 01:33:43,669
was stopped there and no human driver
would have stopped there for that length

5290
01:33:43,669 --> 01:33:43,679
would have stopped there for that length
 

5291
01:33:43,679 --> 01:33:45,830
would have stopped there for that length
of time um they would have gotten out of

5292
01:33:45,830 --> 01:33:45,840
of time um they would have gotten out of
 

5293
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:46,870
of time um they would have gotten out of
the way

5294
01:33:46,870 --> 01:33:46,880
the way
 

5295
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:48,830
the way
and that's another one of

5296
01:33:48,830 --> 01:33:48,840
and that's another one of
 

5297
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:51,510
and that's another one of
my pet peeves

5298
01:33:51,510 --> 01:33:51,520
my pet peeves
 

5299
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:52,629
my pet peeves
that

5300
01:33:52,629 --> 01:33:52,639
that
 

5301
01:33:52,639 --> 01:33:55,110
that
safety has been compromised

5302
01:33:55,110 --> 01:33:55,120
safety has been compromised
 

5303
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:57,110
safety has been compromised
for individuals who didn't sign up for

5304
01:33:57,110 --> 01:33:57,120
for individuals who didn't sign up for
 

5305
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:59,270
for individuals who didn't sign up for
having this happen in their

5306
01:33:59,270 --> 01:33:59,280
having this happen in their
 

5307
01:33:59,280 --> 01:34:00,470
having this happen in their
neighborhood

5308
01:34:00,470 --> 01:34:00,480
neighborhood
 

5309
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:01,750
neighborhood
yeah but

5310
01:34:01,750 --> 01:34:01,760
yeah but
 

5311
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:04,550
yeah but
now you can say that's an edge case but

5312
01:34:04,550 --> 01:34:04,560
now you can say that's an edge case but
 

5313
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:06,550
now you can say that's an edge case but
yeah well i'm in general

5314
01:34:06,550 --> 01:34:06,560
yeah well i'm in general
 

5315
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:09,189
yeah well i'm in general
not a fan which

5316
01:34:09,189 --> 01:34:09,199
not a fan which
 

5317
01:34:09,199 --> 01:34:12,070
not a fan which
of uh anecdotal evidence for stuff like

5318
01:34:12,070 --> 01:34:12,080
of uh anecdotal evidence for stuff like
 

5319
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:14,629
of uh anecdotal evidence for stuff like
this is one of my biggest problems

5320
01:34:14,629 --> 01:34:14,639
this is one of my biggest problems
 

5321
01:34:14,639 --> 01:34:16,070
this is one of my biggest problems
with the discussion of autonomous

5322
01:34:16,070 --> 01:34:16,080
with the discussion of autonomous
 

5323
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:17,350
with the discussion of autonomous
vehicles in general people that

5324

criticize them or support them by using
 

5327
01:34:19,679 --> 01:34:21,990
criticize them or support them by using
cases okay uh uh aren't using anything

5328
01:34:21,990 --> 01:34:22,000
cases okay uh uh aren't using anything
 

5329
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,310
cases okay uh uh aren't using anything

5497
01:37:12,080 --> 01:37:13,990
doing that all the time they will
i by the way one of my that's a whole

5498
01:37:13,990 --> 01:37:14,000
i by the way one of my that's a whole
 

5499
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,310
i by the way one of my that's a whole
nother discussion because my main issue

5500
01:37:16,310 --> 01:37:16,320
nother discussion because my main issue
 

5501
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:18,709
nother discussion because my main issue
with robotics is hri human robot

5502
01:37:18,709 --> 01:37:18,719
with robotics is hri human robot
 

5503
01:37:18,719 --> 01:37:20,229
with robotics is hri human robot
interaction

5504
01:37:20,229 --> 01:37:20,239
interaction
 

5505
01:37:20,239 --> 01:37:22,470
interaction
i believe that robots that interact with

5506
01:37:22,470 --> 01:37:22,480
i believe that robots that interact with
 

5507
01:37:22,480 --> 01:37:24,470
i believe that robots that interact with
humans will have to

5508
01:37:24,470 --> 01:37:24,480
humans will have to
 

5509
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:26,470
humans will have to
push back

5510
01:37:26,470 --> 01:37:26,480
push back
 

5511
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:28,229
push back
like they can't just be

5512
01:37:28,229 --> 01:37:28,239
like they can't just be
 

5513
01:37:28,239 --> 01:37:30,310
like they can't just be
bullied because that creates a very

5514
01:37:30,310 --> 01:37:30,320
bullied because that creates a very
 

5515
01:37:30,320 --> 01:37:32,310
bullied because that creates a very
uncompelling experience for the humans

5516
01:37:32,310 --> 01:37:32,320
uncompelling experience for the humans
 

5517
01:37:32,320 --> 01:37:33,990
uncompelling experience for the humans
yeah well you know waymo before it was

5518
01:37:33,990 --> 01:37:34,000
yeah well you know waymo before it was
 

5519
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,390
yeah well you know waymo before it was
called waymo discovered that you know

5520
01:37:36,390 --> 01:37:36,400
called waymo discovered that you know
 

5521
01:37:36,400 --> 01:37:38,470
called waymo discovered that you know
they had to do that at four-way

5522
01:37:38,470 --> 01:37:38,480
they had to do that at four-way
 

5523
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:40,229
they had to do that at four-way
intersections they had to they had to

5524
01:37:40,229 --> 01:37:40,239
intersections they had to they had to
 

5525
01:37:40,239 --> 01:37:42,470
intersections they had to they had to
nudge forward to give the cue that they

5526
01:37:42,470 --> 01:37:42,480
nudge forward to give the cue that they
 

5527
01:37:42,480 --> 01:37:44,070
nudge forward to give the cue that they
were going to go because otherwise the

5528
01:37:44,070 --> 01:37:44,080
were going to go because otherwise the
 

5529
01:37:44,080 --> 01:37:45,830
were going to go because otherwise the
other drivers would just

5530
01:37:45,830 --> 01:37:45,840
other drivers would just
 

5531
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:47,350
other drivers would just
beat them all the time

5532
01:37:47,350 --> 01:37:47,360
beat them all the time
 

5533
01:37:47,360 --> 01:37:50,310
beat them all the time
so you co-founded irobot as we mentioned

5534
01:37:50,310 --> 01:37:50,320
so you co-founded irobot as we mentioned
 

5535
01:37:50,320 --> 01:37:52,390
so you co-founded irobot as we mentioned
uh one of the most successful

5536
01:37:52,390 --> 01:37:52,400
uh one of the most successful
 

5537
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:54,310
uh one of the most successful
robotics companies ever

5538
01:37:54,310 --> 01:37:54,320
robotics companies ever
 

5539
01:37:54,320 --> 01:37:55,750
robotics companies ever
what are you most proud of with that

5540
01:37:55,750 --> 01:37:55,760
what are you most proud of with that
 

5541
01:37:55,760 --> 01:37:58,870
what are you most proud of with that
company and uh the approach

5542
01:37:58,870 --> 01:37:58,880
company and uh the approach
 

5543
01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:00,070
company and uh the approach

you uh
 

5545
01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:01,990
you uh
took to robotics well like there's

5546
01:38:01,990 --> 01:38:02,000
took to robotics well like there's
 

5547
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,709
took to robotics well like there's
something i'm quite proud of there

5548
01:38:04,709 --> 01:38:04,719
something i'm quite proud of there
 

5549
01:38:04,719 --> 01:38:06,709
something i'm quite proud of there
which may be a surprise

5550
01:38:06,709 --> 01:38:06,719
which may be a surprise
 

5551
01:38:06,719 --> 01:38:08,149
which may be a surprise
but um

but um
 

5553
01:38:08,159 --> 01:38:09,669
but um
i was still on the board when this

5554
01:38:09,669 --> 01:38:09,679
i was still on the board when this
 

5555
01:38:09,679 --> 01:38:14,070
i was still on the board when this
happened it was march 2011

5556
01:38:14,070 --> 01:38:14,080
happened it was march 2011
 

5557
01:38:14,080 --> 01:38:15,430
happened it was march 2011
and we

5558
01:38:15,430 --> 01:38:15,440
and we
 

5559
01:38:15,440 --> 01:38:18,149
and we
sent robots to japan and they were used

5560
01:38:18,149 --> 01:38:18,159
sent robots to japan and they were used
 

5561
01:38:18,159 --> 01:38:19,109
sent robots to japan and they were used
to

5562
01:38:19,109 --> 01:38:19,119
to
 

5563
01:38:19,119 --> 01:38:21,590
to
uh shut help shut down

uh shut help shut down
 

5565
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:25,109
uh shut help shut down
the fukushima fukushima daiichi nuclear

power plant
 

5569
01:38:26,239 --> 01:38:28,310
power plant
um which was everything i've been there

5570
01:38:28,310 --> 01:38:28,320
um which was everything i've been there
 

5571
01:38:28,320 --> 01:38:31,510
um which was everything i've been there
since i was there in 2014 to the robots

5572
01:38:31,510 --> 01:38:31,520
since i was there in 2014 to the robots
 

5573
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:33,270
since i was there in 2014 to the robots
some of the robots were still there i

5574
01:38:33,270 --> 01:38:33,280
some of the robots were still there i
 

5575
01:38:33,280 --> 01:38:35,430
some of the robots were still there i
was i was proud that we were able to do

5576
01:38:35,430 --> 01:38:35,440
was i was proud that we were able to do
 

5577
01:38:35,440 --> 01:38:36,229
was i was proud that we were able to do
that

5578
01:38:36,229 --> 01:38:36,239
that
 

5579
01:38:36,239 --> 01:38:38,550
that
why were we able to do that

5580
01:38:38,550 --> 01:38:38,560
why were we able to do that
 

5581
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:40,550
why were we able to do that
and and you know people have said well

5582
01:38:40,550 --> 01:38:40,560
and and you know people have said well
 

5583
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:43,270
and and you know people have said well
you know japan is so good at robotics

5584
01:38:43,270 --> 01:38:43,280
you know japan is so good at robotics
 

5585
01:38:43,280 --> 01:38:45,590
you know japan is so good at robotics
it was because we had had

5586
01:38:45,590 --> 01:38:45,600
it was because we had had
 

5587
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:47,910
it was because we had had
about 6 500 robots

5588
01:38:47,910 --> 01:38:47,920
about 6 500 robots
 

5589
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:49,270
about 6 500 robots
uh deployed

5590
01:38:49,270 --> 01:38:49,280
uh deployed
 

5591
01:38:49,280 --> 01:38:51,350
uh deployed
in iraq and afghanistan

5592
01:38:51,350 --> 01:38:51,360
in iraq and afghanistan
 

5593
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:54,310
in iraq and afghanistan
teleopt but with intelligence

5594
01:38:54,310 --> 01:38:54,320
teleopt but with intelligence
 

5595
01:38:54,320 --> 01:38:55,510
teleopt but with intelligence
dealing with

5596
01:38:55,510 --> 01:38:55,520
dealing with
 

5597
01:38:55,520 --> 01:38:56,950
dealing with
roadside bombs

5598
01:38:56,950 --> 01:38:56,960
roadside bombs
 

5599
01:38:56,960 --> 01:38:59,510
roadside bombs
so we had uh i think it was at that time

5600
01:38:59,510 --> 01:38:59,520
so we had uh i think it was at that time
 

5601
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:00,950
so we had uh i think it was at that time
nine years of

5602
01:39:00,950 --> 01:39:00,960
nine years of
 

5603
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:02,390
nine years of
in-field

5604
01:39:02,390 --> 01:39:02,400
in-field
 

5605
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:04,229
in-field
experience with the robots in harsh

5606
01:39:04,229 --> 01:39:04,239
experience with the robots in harsh
 

5607
01:39:04,239 --> 01:39:05,350
experience with the robots in harsh
conditions

5608
01:39:05,350 --> 01:39:05,360
conditions
 

5609
01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:07,750
conditions
whereas the japanese robots which were

5610
01:39:07,750 --> 01:39:07,760
whereas the japanese robots which were
 

5611
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:09,669
whereas the japanese robots which were
you know getting you know just goes back

5612
01:39:09,669 --> 01:39:09,679
you know getting you know just goes back
 

5613
01:39:09,679 --> 01:39:10,629
you know getting you know just goes back
to what

5614
01:39:10,629 --> 01:39:10,639
to what
 

5615
01:39:10,639 --> 01:39:12,629
to what
annoys me so much getting all the hype

5616
01:39:12,629 --> 01:39:12,639
annoys me so much getting all the hype
 

5617
01:39:12,639 --> 01:39:15,189
annoys me so much getting all the hype
look at that look at that honda robot it

5618
01:39:15,189 --> 01:39:15,199
look at that look at that honda robot it
 

5619
01:39:15,199 --> 01:39:17,990
look at that look at that honda robot it
can walk well the future's here

5620
01:39:17,990 --> 01:39:18,000
can walk well the future's here
 

5621
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,550
can walk well the future's here
um couldn't do a thing uh because they

5622
01:39:20,550 --> 01:39:20,560
um couldn't do a thing uh because they
 

5623
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:22,470
um couldn't do a thing uh because they
weren't deployed but we had deployed in

5624
01:39:22,470 --> 01:39:22,480
weren't deployed but we had deployed in
 

5625
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:24,790
weren't deployed but we had deployed in
really harsh conditions for a long time

5626
01:39:24,790 --> 01:39:24,800
really harsh conditions for a long time
 

5627
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:26,470
really harsh conditions for a long time
and so we're able to

5628
01:39:26,470 --> 01:39:26,480
and so we're able to
 

5629
01:39:26,480 --> 01:39:27,270
and so we're able to
to

5630
01:39:27,270 --> 01:39:27,280
to
 

5631
01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:29,910
to
do something very positive in a very bad

5632
01:39:29,910 --> 01:39:29,920
do something very positive in a very bad
 

5633
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:31,910
do something very positive in a very bad
situation what about

5723
01:41:00,719 --> 01:41:03,030

which sold for 2 000 euros

5724
01:41:03,030 --> 01:41:03,040
which sold for 2 000 euros
 

5725
01:41:03,040 --> 01:41:04,550
which sold for 2 000 euros
and to us that was not going to be a

5726
01:41:04,550 --> 01:41:04,560
and to us that was not going to be a
 

5727

and to us that was not going to be a
consumer product

consumer product
 

5729
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:06,950
consumer product
so we

5730
01:41:06,950 --> 01:41:06,960
so we
 

5731
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:09,590
so we
had reason to believe that 200 was a was

5732
01:41:09,590 --> 01:41:09,600
had reason to believe that 200 was a was
 

5733
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:12,470
had reason to believe that 200 was a was
a thing that people would buy at

a thing that people would buy at
 

5735
01:41:12,480 --> 01:41:14,950
a thing that people would buy at
that was our aim but that meant we had

5736
01:41:14,950 --> 01:41:14,960
that was our aim but that meant we had

on the shelf making profit
 

5741
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:20,709
on the shelf making profit
uh that means the cost of goods has to

5742
01:41:20,709 --> 01:41:20,719
uh that means the cost of goods has to
 

5743
01:41:20,719 --> 01:41:22,709
uh that means the cost of goods has to
be minimal

5744
01:41:22,709 --> 01:41:22,719
be minimal
 

5745

01:42:45,910 --> 01:42:45,920
winbond which had
 

5823
01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:47,590
winbond which had
and i'd forgotten it had this much ram

5824
01:42:47,590 --> 01:42:47,600
and i'd forgotten it had this much ram
 

5825
01:42:47,600 --> 01:42:50,790
and i'd forgotten it had this much ram
it had 512 bytes of ram and it was in

5826
01:42:50,790 --> 01:42:50,800
it had 512 bytes of ram and it was in
 

5827
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:52,870
it had 512 bytes of ram and it was in
our budget and it had all the

5828
01:42:52,870 --> 01:42:52,880
our budget and it had all the
 

5829
01:42:52,880 --> 01:42:56,149
our budget and it had all the
capabilities we needed yeah so and

5830
01:42:56,149 --> 01:42:56,159
capabilities we needed yeah so and
 

5831
01:42:56,159 --> 01:42:58,470
capabilities we needed yeah so and
you're excited yeah and i i was reading

5832
01:42:58,470 --> 01:42:58,480
you're excited yeah and i i was reading
 

5833
01:42:58,480 --> 01:43:01,990
you're excited yeah and i i was reading
all these emails calling i found this

5834
01:43:01,990 --> 01:43:02,000
all these emails calling i found this
 

5835
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,390
all these emails calling i found this
so did you think did you ever think that

5836
01:43:04,390 --> 01:43:04,400
so did you think did you ever think that
 

5837
01:43:04,400 --> 01:43:07,189
so did you think did you ever think that
you guys could be so successful

5838
01:43:07,189 --> 01:43:07,199
you guys could be so successful
 

5839
01:43:07,199 --> 01:43:08,870
you guys could be so successful
like eventually this company would be so

5840
01:43:08,870 --> 01:43:08,880
like eventually this company would be so
 

5841
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:10,470
like eventually this company would be so
successful did you could you possibly

5842
01:43:10,470 --> 01:43:10,480
successful did you could you possibly
 

5843
01:43:10,480 --> 01:43:11,669
successful did you could you possibly
have imagined

5844
01:43:11,669 --> 01:43:11,679
have imagined
 

5845
01:43:11,679 --> 01:43:14,629
have imagined
um no we never did think that we had 14

5846
01:43:14,629 --> 01:43:14,639
um no we never did think that we had 14
 

5847
01:43:14,639 --> 01:43:17,109
um no we never did think that we had 14
failed business models up till 2002 and

5848
01:43:17,109 --> 01:43:17,119
failed business models up till 2002 and
 

5849
01:43:17,119 --> 01:43:21,109
failed business models up till 2002 and
then we had two winners the same year um

5850
01:43:21,109 --> 01:43:21,119
then we had two winners the same year um
 

5851
01:43:21,119 --> 01:43:22,229
then we had two winners the same year um
uh

5852
01:43:22,229 --> 01:43:22,239
uh
 

5853
01:43:22,239 --> 01:43:24,709
uh
no and then you know

5854
01:43:24,709 --> 01:43:24,719
no and then you know
 

5855
01:43:24,719 --> 01:43:27,189
no and then you know
we i remember the board

5856
01:43:27,189 --> 01:43:27,199
we i remember the board
 

5857
01:43:27,199 --> 01:43:30,310
we i remember the board
um because by this time we had some uh

5858
01:43:30,310 --> 01:43:30,320
um because by this time we had some uh
 

5859
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:32,310
um because by this time we had some uh
venture capital in

5860
01:43:32,310 --> 01:43:32,320
venture capital in
 

5861
01:43:32,320 --> 01:43:36,870
venture capital in
the board went along with us building um

5862
01:43:36,870 --> 01:43:36,880

 

5863
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:38,790

some robots for you know aiming at the

5864
01:43:38,790 --> 01:43:38,800
some robots for you know aiming at the
 

5865
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:41,109
some robots for you know aiming at the
christmas 2002

5866
01:43:41,109 --> 01:43:41,119
christmas 2002
 

5867
01:43:41,119 --> 01:43:43,350
christmas 2002
market and

5868
01:43:43,350 --> 01:43:43,360
market and
 

5869
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:45,350
market and
we went three times over what they

5870
01:43:45,350 --> 01:43:45,360
we went three times over what they
 

5871
01:43:45,360 --> 01:43:47,750
we went three times over what they
authorized and built 70 000 of them and

5872
01:43:47,750 --> 01:43:47,760
authorized and built 70 000 of them and
 

5873
01:43:47,760 --> 01:43:49,590
authorized and built 70 000 of them and
sold them all

5874
01:43:49,590 --> 01:43:49,600
sold them all
 

5875
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:51,189
sold them all
in that first because we released on

5876
01:43:51,189 --> 01:43:51,199
in that first because we released on
 

5877
01:43:51,199 --> 01:43:52,709
in that first because we released on
september 18th

5878
01:43:52,709 --> 01:43:52,719
september 18th
 

5879
01:43:52,719 --> 01:43:53,990
september 18th
and uh

5880
01:43:53,990 --> 01:43:54,000
and uh
 

5881
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:58,229
and uh
all sold by christmas so it was uh

5882
01:43:58,229 --> 01:43:58,239
all sold by christmas so it was uh
 

5883
01:43:58,239 --> 01:44:00,870
all sold by christmas so it was uh
so we were gutsy but

5884
01:44:00,870 --> 01:44:00,880
so we were gutsy but
 

5885
01:44:00,880 --> 01:44:02,790
so we were gutsy but
but yeah you didn't think this will take

5886
01:44:02,790 --> 01:44:02,800
but yeah you didn't think this will take
 

5887
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:07,030
but yeah you didn't think this will take
over the world well this is uh

5888
01:44:07,030 --> 01:44:07,040
over the world well this is uh
 

5889
01:44:07,040 --> 01:44:10,070
over the world well this is uh
so a lot of amazing robotics companies

5890
01:44:10,070 --> 01:44:10,080
so a lot of amazing robotics companies
 

5891
01:44:10,080 --> 01:44:11,830
so a lot of amazing robotics companies
have gone under over the past few

5892
01:44:11,830 --> 01:44:11,840
have gone under over the past few
 

5893
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:13,430
have gone under over the past few
decades

5894
01:44:13,430 --> 01:44:13,440
decades
 

5895
01:44:13,440 --> 01:44:16,470
decades
why do you think it's so damn hard

5896
01:44:16,470 --> 01:44:16,480
why do you think it's so damn hard
 

5897
01:44:16,480 --> 01:44:19,669
why do you think it's so damn hard
to uh run a successful well there's a

5898
01:44:19,669 --> 01:44:19,679
to uh run a successful well there's a
 

5899
01:44:19,679 --> 01:44:23,830
to uh run a successful well there's a
robotics company there's a few things um

5900
01:44:23,830 --> 01:44:23,840
robotics company there's a few things um
 

5901
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:25,669
robotics company there's a few things um
one is

5902
01:44:25,669 --> 01:44:25,679
one is
 

5903
01:44:25,679 --> 01:44:29,590
one is
expectations of capabilities by the

5904
01:44:29,590 --> 01:44:29,600
expectations of capabilities by the
 

5905
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:31,030
expectations of capabilities by the
founders that are

5906
01:44:31,030 --> 01:44:31,040
founders that are
 

5907
01:44:31,040 --> 01:44:32,550
founders that are
off base

5908
01:44:32,550 --> 01:44:32,560
off base
 

5909
01:44:32,560 --> 01:44:34,070
off base
the founders not the consumer and the

5910
01:44:34,070 --> 01:44:34,080
the founders not the consumer and the
 

5911
01:44:34,080 --> 01:44:35,990
the founders not the consumer and the
founders yeah expectations what what can

5912
01:44:35,990 --> 01:44:36,000
founders yeah expectations what what can
 

5913
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,310
founders yeah expectations what what can
be delivered sure

5914
01:44:38,310 --> 01:44:38,320
be delivered sure
 

5915
01:44:38,320 --> 01:44:40,550
be delivered sure
mispricing

5916
01:44:40,550 --> 01:44:40,560
mispricing
 

5917
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:41,270
mispricing
and

5918
01:44:41,270 --> 01:44:41,280
and
 

5919
01:44:41,280 --> 01:44:43,189
and
what a customer thinks is a valid price

5920
01:44:43,189 --> 01:44:43,199
what a customer thinks is a valid price
 

5921
01:44:43,199 --> 01:44:45,109
what a customer thinks is a valid price
is not rational

5922
01:44:45,109 --> 01:44:45,119
is not rational
 

5923
01:44:45,119 --> 01:44:47,350
is not rational
necessarily yeah

5924
01:44:47,350 --> 01:44:47,360
necessarily yeah
 

5925
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:50,149
necessarily yeah
and expectations of customers

5926
01:44:50,149 --> 01:44:50,159
and expectations of customers
 

5927
01:44:50,159 --> 01:44:53,430
and expectations of customers
and

5928
01:44:53,430 --> 01:44:53,440

 

5929
01:44:53,440 --> 01:44:55,750

just the

5930
01:44:55,750 --> 01:44:55,760
just the
 

5931
01:44:55,760 --> 01:44:59,350
just the
sheer hardness of getting people

5932
01:44:59,350 --> 01:44:59,360
sheer hardness of getting people
 

5933
01:44:59,360 --> 01:45:01,270
sheer hardness of getting people
to adopt a new technology and i've

5934
01:45:01,270 --> 01:45:01,280
to adopt a new technology and i've
 

5935
01:45:01,280 --> 01:45:03,189
to adopt a new technology and i've
suffered from all three moons

5936
01:45:03,189 --> 01:45:03,199
suffered from all three moons
 

5937
01:45:03,199 --> 01:45:05,270
suffered from all three moons
uh you know i've had

5938
01:45:05,270 --> 01:45:05,280
uh you know i've had
 

5939
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:07,669
uh you know i've had
more failures and successes

5940
01:45:07,669 --> 01:45:07,679
more failures and successes
 

5941
01:45:07,679 --> 01:45:09,669
more failures and successes
in terms of companies i've suffered from

5942
01:45:09,669 --> 01:45:09,679
in terms of companies i've suffered from
 

5943
01:45:09,679 --> 01:45:10,709
in terms of companies i've suffered from
all three

5944
01:45:10,709 --> 01:45:10,719
all three
 

5945
01:45:10,719 --> 01:45:12,070
all three
um

5946
01:45:12,070 --> 01:45:12,080
um
 

5947
01:45:12,080 --> 01:45:14,310
um
so

5948
01:45:14,310 --> 01:45:14,320

 

5949
01:45:14,320 --> 01:45:17,750

do you think

5950
01:45:17,750 --> 01:45:17,760

 

5951
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:20,550

one day there will be a robotics company

5952
01:45:20,550 --> 01:45:20,560
one day there will be a robotics company
 

5953
01:45:20,560 --> 01:45:22,550
one day there will be a robotics company
and by robotics company i mean where

5954
01:45:22,550 --> 01:45:22,560
and by robotics company i mean where
 

5955
01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:24,709
and by robotics company i mean where
your primary source of income is

5956
01:45:24,709 --> 01:45:24,719
your primary source of income is
 

5957
01:45:24,719 --> 01:45:26,149
your primary source of income is
from robots

5958
01:45:26,149 --> 01:45:26,159
from robots
 

5959
01:45:26,159 --> 01:45:28,229
from robots
that will be a trillion plus dollar

5960
01:45:28,229 --> 01:45:28,239
that will be a trillion plus dollar
 

5961
01:45:28,239 --> 01:45:29,510
that will be a trillion plus dollar
company

5962
01:45:29,510 --> 01:45:29,520
company
 

5963
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:31,830
company
and it's so what come what would that

5964
01:45:31,830 --> 01:45:31,840
and it's so what come what would that
 

5965
01:45:31,840 --> 01:45:37,109
and it's so what come what would that
company do

5966
01:45:37,109 --> 01:45:37,119

 

5967
01:45:37,119 --> 01:45:38,870

i can't you know because i'm still

5968
01:45:38,870 --> 01:45:38,880
i can't you know because i'm still
 

5969
01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:43,109
i can't you know because i'm still
starting robot companies yeah

5970
01:45:43,109 --> 01:45:43,119

 

5971
01:45:43,119 --> 01:45:45,590

i'm not making any such predictions in

5972
01:45:45,590 --> 01:45:45,600
i'm not making any such predictions in
 

5973
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:47,109
i'm not making any such predictions in
my own mind i'm not thinking about a

5974
01:45:47,109 --> 01:45:47,119
my own mind i'm not thinking about a
 

5975
01:45:47,119 --> 01:45:49,350
my own mind i'm not thinking about a
trillion dollar company and by the way i

5976
01:45:49,350 --> 01:45:49,360
trillion dollar company and by the way i
 

5977
01:45:49,360 --> 01:45:51,189
trillion dollar company and by the way i
don't think you know in the 90s anyone

5978
01:45:51,189 --> 01:45:51,199
don't think you know in the 90s anyone
 

5979
01:45:51,199 --> 01:45:52,629
don't think you know in the 90s anyone
was thinking that apple would ever be a

5980
01:45:52,629 --> 01:45:52,639
was thinking that apple would ever be a
 

5981
01:45:52,639 --> 01:45:54,310
was thinking that apple would ever be a
trillion-dollar company so these are

5982
01:45:54,310 --> 01:45:54,320
trillion-dollar company so these are
 

5983
01:45:54,320 --> 01:45:57,750
trillion-dollar company so these are
these are very hard to to predict but

5984
01:45:57,750 --> 01:45:57,760
these are very hard to to predict but
 

5985
01:45:57,760 --> 01:45:59,669
these are very hard to to predict but
sorry to interrupt but don't you because

5986
01:45:59,669 --> 01:45:59,679
sorry to interrupt but don't you because
 

5987
01:45:59,679 --> 01:46:01,910
sorry to interrupt but don't you because
i kind of have a vision

5988
01:46:01,910 --> 01:46:01,920
i kind of have a vision
 

5989
01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:04,310
i kind of have a vision
in this in a small way and it's a big

5990
01:46:04,310 --> 01:46:04,320
in this in a small way and it's a big
 

5991
01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:06,390
in this in a small way and it's a big
vision in a small way that

5992
01:46:06,390 --> 01:46:06,400
vision in a small way that
 

5993
01:46:06,400 --> 01:46:08,310
vision in a small way that
i see that there would be robots in the

5994
01:46:08,310 --> 01:46:08,320
i see that there would be robots in the
 

5995
01:46:08,320 --> 01:46:10,229
i see that there would be robots in the
home

5996
01:46:10,229 --> 01:46:10,239
home
 

5997
01:46:10,239 --> 01:46:13,590
home
at scale like roomba but more

5998
01:46:13,590 --> 01:46:13,600
at scale like roomba but more
 

5999
01:46:13,600 --> 01:46:15,669
at scale like roomba but more
and that's trillion dollar

6000
01:46:15,669 --> 01:46:15,679
and that's trillion dollar
 

6001
01:46:15,679 --> 01:46:17,189
and that's trillion dollar
right and i and i think there's a

6002
01:46:17,189 --> 01:46:17,199
right and i and i think there's a
 

6003
01:46:17,199 --> 01:46:18,790
right and i and i think there's a
there's a real market pool for them

6004
01:46:18,790 --> 01:46:18,800
there's a real market pool for them
 

6005
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:21,270
there's a real market pool for them
because of the um um demographic

6006
01:46:21,270 --> 01:46:21,280
because of the um um demographic
 

6007
01:46:21,280 --> 01:46:23,430
because of the um um demographic
inversion you know who's who's going to

6008
01:46:23,430 --> 01:46:23,440
inversion you know who's who's going to
 

6009
01:46:23,440 --> 01:46:26,229
inversion you know who's who's going to
do all the stuff for the older people um

6010
01:46:26,229 --> 01:46:26,239
do all the stuff for the older people um
 

6011
01:46:26,239 --> 01:46:29,030
do all the stuff for the older people um
there's too many i'm you know i'm i'm

6012
01:46:29,030 --> 01:46:29,040
there's too many i'm you know i'm i'm
 

6013
01:46:29,040 --> 01:46:31,669
there's too many i'm you know i'm i'm
leading here

6014
01:46:31,669 --> 01:46:31,679
leading here
 

6015
01:46:31,679 --> 01:46:33,910
leading here
it's going to be too many of us

6016
01:46:33,910 --> 01:46:33,920
it's going to be too many of us
 

6017
01:46:33,920 --> 01:46:34,709
it's going to be too many of us
and

6018
01:46:34,709 --> 01:46:34,719
and
 

6019
01:46:34,719 --> 01:46:36,390
and
um

6020
01:46:36,390 --> 01:46:36,400
um
 

6021
01:46:36,400 --> 01:46:37,189
um
but

6022
01:46:37,189 --> 01:46:37,199
but
 

6023
01:46:37,199 --> 01:46:39,510
but
we don't have capable enough robots to

6024
01:46:39,510 --> 01:46:39,520
we don't have capable enough robots to
 

6025
01:46:39,520 --> 01:46:41,270
we don't have capable enough robots to
to make that economic argument at this

6026
01:46:41,270 --> 01:46:41,280
to make that economic argument at this
 

6027
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:42,310
to make that economic argument at this
point

6028
01:46:42,310 --> 01:46:42,320
point
 

6029
01:46:42,320 --> 01:46:44,550
point
do i expect that that will happen yes i

6030
01:46:44,550 --> 01:46:44,560
do i expect that that will happen yes i
 

6031
01:46:44,560 --> 01:46:46,550
do i expect that that will happen yes i
expect it will happen but i gotta tell

6032
01:46:46,550 --> 01:46:46,560
expect it will happen but i gotta tell
 

6033
01:46:46,560 --> 01:46:49,669
expect it will happen but i gotta tell
you we introduced the roomba in 2002 and

6034
01:46:49,669 --> 01:46:49,679
you we introduced the roomba in 2002 and
 

6035
01:46:49,679 --> 01:46:51,590
you we introduced the roomba in 2002 and
i stayed another

6036
01:46:51,590 --> 01:46:51,600
i stayed another
 

6037
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:53,990
i stayed another
nine years we were always trying to find

6038
01:46:53,990 --> 01:46:54,000
nine years we were always trying to find
 

6039
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:57,270
nine years we were always trying to find
what the next home robot would be and

6040
01:46:57,270 --> 01:46:57,280
what the next home robot would be and
 

6041
01:46:57,280 --> 01:47:00,149
what the next home robot would be and
still today the primary product of 20

6042
01:47:00,149 --> 01:47:00,159
still today the primary product of 20
 

6043
01:47:00,159 --> 01:47:02,310
still today the primary product of 20
years almost 20 years later 19 years

6044
01:47:02,310 --> 01:47:02,320
years almost 20 years later 19 years
 

6045
01:47:02,320 --> 01:47:03,990
years almost 20 years later 19 years
later the primary product is still the

6046
01:47:03,990 --> 01:47:04,000
later the primary product is still the
 

6047
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:07,270
later the primary product is still the
roomba so irobot hasn't found the next

6048
01:47:07,270 --> 01:47:07,280
roomba so irobot hasn't found the next
 

6049
01:47:07,280 --> 01:47:09,350
roomba so irobot hasn't found the next
one do you think it's possible for one

6050
01:47:09,350 --> 01:47:09,360
one do you think it's possible for one
 

6051
01:47:09,360 --> 01:47:12,070
one do you think it's possible for one
person in the garage to build it versus

6052
01:47:12,070 --> 01:47:12,080
person in the garage to build it versus
 

6053
01:47:12,080 --> 01:47:13,669
person in the garage to build it versus
like google

6054
01:47:13,669 --> 01:47:13,679
like google
 

6055
01:47:13,679 --> 01:47:15,910
like google
launching google self-driving car that

6056
01:47:15,910 --> 01:47:15,920
launching google self-driving car that
 

6057
01:47:15,920 --> 01:47:18,550
launching google self-driving car that
turns into waymo you think it's pos

6058
01:47:18,550 --> 01:47:18,560
turns into waymo you think it's pos
 

6059
01:47:18,560 --> 01:47:19,910
turns into waymo you think it's pos
this is almost like what it takes to

6060
01:47:19,910 --> 01:47:19,920
this is almost like what it takes to
 

6061
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:21,990
this is almost like what it takes to
build a successful robotics company do

6062
01:47:21,990 --> 01:47:22,000
build a successful robotics company do
 

6063
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:23,270
build a successful robotics company do
you think it's possible to go from the

6064
01:47:23,270 --> 01:47:23,280
you think it's possible to go from the
 

6065
01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:25,270
you think it's possible to go from the
ground up or is it just too much capital

6066
01:47:25,270 --> 01:47:25,280
ground up or is it just too much capital
 

6067
01:47:25,280 --> 01:47:26,390
ground up or is it just too much capital
investment

6068
01:47:26,390 --> 01:47:26,400
investment
 

6069
01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:27,590
investment
yeah so

6070
01:47:27,590 --> 01:47:27,600
yeah so
 

6071
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:30,229
yeah so
it's very hard to get there

6072
01:47:30,229 --> 01:47:30,239
it's very hard to get there
 

6073
01:47:30,239 --> 01:47:31,270
it's very hard to get there
um

6074
01:47:31,270 --> 01:47:31,280
um
 

6075
01:47:31,280 --> 01:47:32,790
um
without a lot of capital and we're

6076
01:47:32,790 --> 01:47:32,800
without a lot of capital and we're
 

6077
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:34,070
without a lot of capital and we're
starting to see

6078
01:47:34,070 --> 01:47:34,080
starting to see
 

6079
01:47:34,080 --> 01:47:37,350
starting to see
you know a fair chunks of capital uh for

6080
01:47:37,350 --> 01:47:37,360
you know a fair chunks of capital uh for
 

6081
01:47:37,360 --> 01:47:40,470
you know a fair chunks of capital uh for
some robotics companies um you know

6082
01:47:40,470 --> 01:47:40,480
some robotics companies um you know
 

6083
01:47:40,480 --> 01:47:42,709
some robotics companies um you know
series b's because i saw one yesterday

6084
01:47:42,709 --> 01:47:42,719
series b's because i saw one yesterday
 

6085
01:47:42,719 --> 01:47:44,950
series b's because i saw one yesterday
for 80 million dollars i think it was

6086
01:47:44,950 --> 01:47:44,960
for 80 million dollars i think it was
 

6087
01:47:44,960 --> 01:47:47,170
for 80 million dollars i think it was
for co-variant um

6088
01:47:47,170 --> 01:47:47,180
for co-variant um
 

6089
01:47:47,180 --> 01:47:49,109
for co-variant um

[Music]
 

6091
01:47:49,119 --> 01:47:51,910
[Music]
but it can take real money to

6092
01:47:51,910 --> 01:47:51,920
but it can take real money to
 

6093
01:47:51,920 --> 01:47:53,830
but it can take real money to
to get into these things and you may

6094
01:47:53,830 --> 01:47:53,840
to get into these things and you may
 

6095
01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:55,910
to get into these things and you may
fail along the way i've certainly failed

6096
01:47:55,910 --> 01:47:55,920
fail along the way i've certainly failed
 

6097
01:47:55,920 --> 01:47:58,070
fail along the way i've certainly failed
at rethink robotics um and we've all

6098
01:47:58,070 --> 01:47:58,080
at rethink robotics um and we've all
 

6099
01:47:58,080 --> 01:48:00,470
at rethink robotics um and we've all
lost 150 million dollars in capital

6100
01:48:00,470 --> 01:48:00,480
lost 150 million dollars in capital
 

6101
01:48:00,480 --> 01:48:03,430
lost 150 million dollars in capital
there so okay so rethink robotics is

6102
01:48:03,430 --> 01:48:03,440
there so okay so rethink robotics is
 

6103
01:48:03,440 --> 01:48:05,109
there so okay so rethink robotics is
another amazing robotics company you

6104
01:48:05,109 --> 01:48:05,119
another amazing robotics company you
 

6105
01:48:05,119 --> 01:48:06,550
another amazing robotics company you
co-founded

6106
01:48:06,550 --> 01:48:06,560
co-founded
 

6107
01:48:06,560 --> 01:48:09,030
co-founded
so what was the vision there

6108
01:48:09,030 --> 01:48:09,040
so what was the vision there
 

6109
01:48:09,040 --> 01:48:10,070
so what was the vision there
what was

6110
01:48:10,070 --> 01:48:10,080
what was
 

6111
01:48:10,080 --> 01:48:12,229
what was
the dream and

6112
01:48:12,229 --> 01:48:12,239
the dream and
 

6113
01:48:12,239 --> 01:48:14,229
the dream and
what what are you most proud of with

6114
01:48:14,229 --> 01:48:14,239
what what are you most proud of with
 

6115
01:48:14,239 --> 01:48:16,629
what what are you most proud of with
rethink robotics i'm most proud of the

6116
01:48:16,629 --> 01:48:16,639
rethink robotics i'm most proud of the
 

6117
01:48:16,639 --> 01:48:19,109
rethink robotics i'm most proud of the
fact that we got um

6118
01:48:19,109 --> 01:48:19,119
fact that we got um
 

6119
01:48:19,119 --> 01:48:22,149
fact that we got um
robots out of the cage in factories

6120
01:48:22,149 --> 01:48:22,159
robots out of the cage in factories
 

6121
01:48:22,159 --> 01:48:24,149
robots out of the cage in factories
that were safe absolutely safe for

6122
01:48:24,149 --> 01:48:24,159
that were safe absolutely safe for
 

6123
01:48:24,159 --> 01:48:25,910
that were safe absolutely safe for
people and robots to be next to each

6124
01:48:25,910 --> 01:48:25,920
people and robots to be next to each
 

6125
01:48:25,920 --> 01:48:28,149
people and robots to be next to each
other so these are robotic arms robotics

6126
01:48:28,149 --> 01:48:28,159
other so these are robotic arms robotics
 

6127
01:48:28,159 --> 01:48:29,750
other so these are robotic arms robotics
arms they're able to pick up stuff and

6128
01:48:29,750 --> 01:48:29,760
arms they're able to pick up stuff and
 

6129
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:31,830
arms they're able to pick up stuff and
interact with humans yeah and that

6130
01:48:31,830 --> 01:48:31,840
interact with humans yeah and that
 

6131
01:48:31,840 --> 01:48:34,149
interact with humans yeah and that
humans could re-task them

6132
01:48:34,149 --> 01:48:34,159
humans could re-task them
 

6133
01:48:34,159 --> 01:48:35,669
humans could re-task them
without writing code

6134
01:48:35,669 --> 01:48:35,679
without writing code
 

6135
01:48:35,679 --> 01:48:38,070
without writing code
right and and now that sort of become an

6136
01:48:38,070 --> 01:48:38,080
right and and now that sort of become an
 

6137
01:48:38,080 --> 01:48:39,990
right and and now that sort of become an
expectation for a lot of other little

6138
01:48:39,990 --> 01:48:40,000
expectation for a lot of other little
 

6139
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,070
expectation for a lot of other little
companies and big companies are

6140
01:48:42,070 --> 01:48:42,080
companies and big companies are
 

6141
01:48:42,080 --> 01:48:43,910
companies and big companies are
advertising they're doing that's both an

6142
01:48:43,910 --> 01:48:43,920
advertising they're doing that's both an
 

6143
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:45,990
advertising they're doing that's both an
interface problem and also safety

6144
01:48:45,990 --> 01:48:46,000
interface problem and also safety
 

6145
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:47,270
interface problem and also safety
problem yeah

6146
01:48:47,270 --> 01:48:47,280
problem yeah
 

6147
01:48:47,280 --> 01:48:48,550
problem yeah
yeah

6148
01:48:48,550 --> 01:48:48,560
yeah
 

6149
01:48:48,560 --> 01:48:52,070
yeah
so i'm most proud of that

6150
01:48:52,070 --> 01:48:52,080
so i'm most proud of that
 

6151
01:48:52,080 --> 01:48:55,669
so i'm most proud of that
i completely i let

6152
01:48:55,669 --> 01:48:55,679
i completely i let
 

6153
01:48:55,679 --> 01:48:58,310
i completely i let
myself be talked out of

6154
01:48:58,310 --> 01:48:58,320
myself be talked out of
 

6155
01:48:58,320 --> 01:49:01,109
myself be talked out of
what i wanted to do and you know you've

6156
01:49:01,109 --> 01:49:01,119
what i wanted to do and you know you've
 

6157
01:49:01,119 --> 01:49:02,870
what i wanted to do and you know you've
always got you know i can't replay the

6158
01:49:02,870 --> 01:49:02,880
always got you know i can't replay the
 

6159
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:04,149
always got you know i can't replay the
tape

6160
01:49:04,149 --> 01:49:04,159
tape
 

6161
01:49:04,159 --> 01:49:06,950
tape
you know i can't replay it maybe

6162
01:49:06,950 --> 01:49:06,960
you know i can't replay it maybe
 

6163
01:49:06,960 --> 01:49:09,830
you know i can't replay it maybe
maybe i you know if i'd been stronger um

6164
01:49:09,830 --> 01:49:09,840
maybe i you know if i'd been stronger um
 

6165
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:11,669
maybe i you know if i'd been stronger um
and i remember the day i remember the

6166
01:49:11,669 --> 01:49:11,679
and i remember the day i remember the
 

6167
01:49:11,679 --> 01:49:13,270
and i remember the day i remember the
exact meeting

6168
01:49:13,270 --> 01:49:13,280
exact meeting
 

6169
01:49:13,280 --> 01:49:16,310
exact meeting
um can you take me through that meeting

6170
01:49:16,310 --> 01:49:16,320
um can you take me through that meeting
 

6171
01:49:16,320 --> 01:49:17,189
um can you take me through that meeting
yeah

6172
01:49:17,189 --> 01:49:17,199
yeah
 

6173
01:49:17,199 --> 01:49:18,310
yeah
um

6174
01:49:18,310 --> 01:49:18,320
um
 

6175
01:49:18,320 --> 01:49:21,589
um
so i said that i'd set as a target for

6176
01:49:21,589 --> 01:49:21,599
so i said that i'd set as a target for
 

6177
01:49:21,599 --> 01:49:23,109
so i said that i'd set as a target for
the company that we were going to build

6178
01:49:23,109 --> 01:49:23,119
the company that we were going to build
 

6179
01:49:23,119 --> 01:49:25,109
the company that we were going to build
three thousand dollar robots with force

6180
01:49:25,109 --> 01:49:25,119
three thousand dollar robots with force
 

6181
01:49:25,119 --> 01:49:26,470
three thousand dollar robots with force
feedback

6182
01:49:26,470 --> 01:49:26,480
feedback
 

6183
01:49:26,480 --> 01:49:29,750
feedback
um that was safe for people to be around

6184
01:49:29,750 --> 01:49:29,760
um that was safe for people to be around
 

6185
01:49:29,760 --> 01:49:32,229
um that was safe for people to be around
wow that was my goal

6186
01:49:32,229 --> 01:49:32,239
wow that was my goal
 

6187
01:49:32,239 --> 01:49:35,910
wow that was my goal
and we built uh so we started in 2008

6188
01:49:35,910 --> 01:49:35,920
and we built uh so we started in 2008
 

6189
01:49:35,920 --> 01:49:39,510
and we built uh so we started in 2008
and we had prototypes built of plastic

6190
01:49:39,510 --> 01:49:39,520
and we had prototypes built of plastic
 

6191
01:49:39,520 --> 01:49:41,510
and we had prototypes built of plastic
plastic gearboxes

6192
01:49:41,510 --> 01:49:41,520
plastic gearboxes
 

6193
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:43,589
plastic gearboxes
and at a three thousand dollar you know

6194
01:49:43,589 --> 01:49:43,599
and at a three thousand dollar you know
 

6195
01:49:43,599 --> 01:49:44,709
and at a three thousand dollar you know
uh

6196
01:49:44,709 --> 01:49:44,719
uh
 

6197
01:49:44,719 --> 01:49:47,270
uh
lifetime of three thousand dollar

6198
01:49:47,270 --> 01:49:47,280
lifetime of three thousand dollar
 

6199
01:49:47,280 --> 01:49:48,229
lifetime of three thousand dollar
i was

6200
01:49:48,229 --> 01:49:48,239
i was
 

6201
01:49:48,239 --> 01:49:50,070
i was
saying we're going to go after not the

6202
01:49:50,070 --> 01:49:50,080
saying we're going to go after not the
 

6203
01:49:50,080 --> 01:49:51,910
saying we're going to go after not the
people who already have robot arms in

6204
01:49:51,910 --> 01:49:51,920
people who already have robot arms in
 

6205
01:49:51,920 --> 01:49:53,750
people who already have robot arms in
factories the people who never have a

6206
01:49:53,750 --> 01:49:53,760
factories the people who never have a
 

6207
01:49:53,760 --> 01:49:55,669
factories the people who never have a
robot arm we're going to go after a

6208
01:49:55,669 --> 01:49:55,679
robot arm we're going to go after a
 

6209
01:49:55,679 --> 01:49:57,510
robot arm we're going to go after a
different market so we don't have to

6210
01:49:57,510 --> 01:49:57,520
different market so we don't have to
 

6211
01:49:57,520 --> 01:49:59,750
different market so we don't have to
meet their expectations

6212
01:49:59,750 --> 01:49:59,760
meet their expectations
 

6213
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:00,870
meet their expectations
um

6214
01:50:00,870 --> 01:50:00,880
um
 

6215
01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:02,310
um
and and so we're going to build it out

6216
01:50:02,310 --> 01:50:02,320
and and so we're going to build it out
 

6217
01:50:02,320 --> 01:50:04,390
and and so we're going to build it out
of plastic it doesn't have to have a 35

6218
01:50:04,390 --> 01:50:04,400
of plastic it doesn't have to have a 35
 

6219
01:50:04,400 --> 01:50:06,629
of plastic it doesn't have to have a 35
000 lifetime it's going to be so cheap

6220
01:50:06,629 --> 01:50:06,639
000 lifetime it's going to be so cheap
 

6221
01:50:06,639 --> 01:50:12,070
000 lifetime it's going to be so cheap
that it's opex not capex

6222
01:50:12,070 --> 01:50:12,080

 

6223
01:50:12,080 --> 01:50:13,510

and so we had we had a prototype that

6224
01:50:13,510 --> 01:50:13,520
and so we had we had a prototype that
 

6225
01:50:13,520 --> 01:50:15,669
and so we had we had a prototype that
worked reasonably well

6226
01:50:15,669 --> 01:50:15,679
worked reasonably well
 

6227
01:50:15,679 --> 01:50:17,430
worked reasonably well
but

6228
01:50:17,430 --> 01:50:17,440
but
 

6229
01:50:17,440 --> 01:50:19,910
but
the control engineers were complaining

6230
01:50:19,910 --> 01:50:19,920
the control engineers were complaining
 

6231
01:50:19,920 --> 01:50:22,070
the control engineers were complaining
about these plastic gearboxes with a

6232
01:50:22,070 --> 01:50:22,080
about these plastic gearboxes with a
 

6233
01:50:22,080 --> 01:50:24,470
about these plastic gearboxes with a
beautiful little planetary gearbox um

6234
01:50:24,470 --> 01:50:24,480
beautiful little planetary gearbox um
 

6235
01:50:24,480 --> 01:50:26,229
beautiful little planetary gearbox um
but

6236
01:50:26,229 --> 01:50:26,239
but
 

6237
01:50:26,239 --> 01:50:27,350
but
we could

6238
01:50:27,350 --> 01:50:27,360
we could
 

6239
01:50:27,360 --> 01:50:29,189
we could
use something called serious elastic

6240
01:50:29,189 --> 01:50:29,199
use something called serious elastic
 

6241
01:50:29,199 --> 01:50:31,109
use something called serious elastic
actuators we embedded them in there we

6242
01:50:31,109 --> 01:50:31,119
actuators we embedded them in there we
 

6243
01:50:31,119 --> 01:50:33,350
actuators we embedded them in there we
could measure forces we knew when we hit

6244
01:50:33,350 --> 01:50:33,360
could measure forces we knew when we hit
 

6245
01:50:33,360 --> 01:50:35,109
could measure forces we knew when we hit
something et cetera

6246
01:50:35,109 --> 01:50:35,119
something et cetera
 

6247
01:50:35,119 --> 01:50:36,709
something et cetera
the control engineers were saying yeah

6248
01:50:36,709 --> 01:50:36,719
the control engineers were saying yeah
 

6249
01:50:36,719 --> 01:50:39,589
the control engineers were saying yeah
but this is torque ripple because these

6250
01:50:39,589 --> 01:50:39,599
but this is torque ripple because these
 

6251
01:50:39,599 --> 01:50:42,070
but this is torque ripple because these
plastic gears they're not great gears

6252
01:50:42,070 --> 01:50:42,080
plastic gears they're not great gears
 

6253
01:50:42,080 --> 01:50:43,990
plastic gears they're not great gears
and there's this ripple and trying to do

6254
01:50:43,990 --> 01:50:44,000
and there's this ripple and trying to do
 

6255
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,950
and there's this ripple and trying to do
force control around this ripple is so

6256
01:50:46,950 --> 01:50:46,960
force control around this ripple is so
 

6257
01:50:46,960 --> 01:50:49,750
force control around this ripple is so
hard

6258
01:50:49,750 --> 01:50:49,760

 

6259
01:50:49,760 --> 01:50:51,910

and i'm not going to name names but i

6260
01:50:51,910 --> 01:50:51,920
and i'm not going to name names but i
 

6261
01:50:51,920 --> 01:50:54,149
and i'm not going to name names but i
remember one of the mechanical engineers

6262
01:50:54,149 --> 01:50:54,159
remember one of the mechanical engineers
 

6263
01:50:54,159 --> 01:50:56,470
remember one of the mechanical engineers
saying we'll just build a metal gearbox

6264
01:50:56,470 --> 01:50:56,480
saying we'll just build a metal gearbox
 

6265
01:50:56,480 --> 01:50:58,070
saying we'll just build a metal gearbox
with spur gears

6266
01:50:58,070 --> 01:50:58,080
with spur gears
 

6267
01:50:58,080 --> 01:51:01,109
with spur gears
and it'll take six weeks we'll be done

6268
01:51:01,109 --> 01:51:01,119
and it'll take six weeks we'll be done
 

6269
01:51:01,119 --> 01:51:03,669
and it'll take six weeks we'll be done
problem solved

6270
01:51:03,669 --> 01:51:03,679
problem solved
 

6271
01:51:03,679 --> 01:51:05,830
problem solved
two years later we got to get the spur

6272
01:51:05,830 --> 01:51:05,840
two years later we got to get the spur
 

6273
01:51:05,840 --> 01:51:09,430
two years later we got to get the spur
gearbox working yeah um we we cost

6274
01:51:09,430 --> 01:51:09,440
gearbox working yeah um we we cost
 

6275
01:51:09,440 --> 01:51:11,589
gearbox working yeah um we we cost
reduced it every possible way we could

6276
01:51:11,589 --> 01:51:11,599
reduced it every possible way we could
 

6277
01:51:11,599 --> 01:51:14,070
reduced it every possible way we could
um yeah but

6278
01:51:14,070 --> 01:51:14,080
um yeah but
 

6279
01:51:14,080 --> 01:51:16,229
um yeah but
now the price went up to and then the

6280
01:51:16,229 --> 01:51:16,239
now the price went up to and then the
 

6281
01:51:16,239 --> 01:51:17,910
now the price went up to and then the
ceo at the time said well we have to

6282
01:51:17,910 --> 01:51:17,920
ceo at the time said well we have to
 

6283
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:21,030
ceo at the time said well we have to
have two arms not one arm so our first

6284
01:51:21,030 --> 01:51:21,040
have two arms not one arm so our first
 

6285
01:51:21,040 --> 01:51:26,229
have two arms not one arm so our first
robot product baxter now cost 25 000

6286
01:51:26,229 --> 01:51:26,239

 

6287
01:51:26,239 --> 01:51:27,510

and the only people who are going to

6288
01:51:27,510 --> 01:51:27,520
and the only people who are going to
 

6289
01:51:27,520 --> 01:51:29,830
and the only people who are going to
look at that were people who had arms in

6290
01:51:29,830 --> 01:51:29,840
look at that were people who had arms in
 

6291
01:51:29,840 --> 01:51:31,109
look at that were people who had arms in
factories because that was somewhat

6292
01:51:31,109 --> 01:51:31,119
factories because that was somewhat
 

6293
01:51:31,119 --> 01:51:32,950
factories because that was somewhat
cheaper for two arms than arms and

6294
01:51:32,950 --> 01:51:32,960
cheaper for two arms than arms and
 

6295
01:51:32,960 --> 01:51:35,750
cheaper for two arms than arms and
factories but they were used to

6296
01:51:35,750 --> 01:51:35,760
factories but they were used to
 

6297
01:51:35,760 --> 01:51:37,910
factories but they were used to

and certain velocities

6302
01:51:42,310 --> 01:51:42,320
and certain velocities
 

6303
01:51:42,320 --> 01:51:44,709
and certain velocities
and we i kept thinking but that's not

6304
01:51:44,709 --> 01:51:44,719
and we i kept thinking but that's not
 

6305
01:51:44,719 --> 01:51:46,229
and we i kept thinking but that's not
what we're giving you you don't need

6306
01:51:46,229 --> 01:51:46,239
what we're giving you you don't need
 

6307
01:51:46,239 --> 01:51:48,470
what we're giving you you don't need
position repeatability use force control

6308
01:51:48,470 --> 01:51:48,480
position repeatability use force control
 

6309
01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:50,950
position repeatability use force control
like a human does no

6310
01:51:50,950 --> 01:51:50,960
like a human does no
 

6311
01:51:50,960 --> 01:51:52,229
like a human does no
no but we want we want that

6312
01:51:52,229 --> 01:51:52,239
no but we want we want that
 

6313
01:51:52,239 --> 01:51:54,229
no but we want we want that
repeatability we want that repeatability

6314
01:51:54,229 --> 01:51:54,239
repeatability we want that repeatability
 

6315
01:51:54,239 --> 01:51:55,669
repeatability we want that repeatability
yes all the other robots have that

6316
01:51:55,669 --> 01:51:55,679
yes all the other robots have that
 

6317
01:51:55,679 --> 01:51:57,109
yes all the other robots have that
repeatability why don't you have that

6318
01:51:57,109 --> 01:51:57,119
repeatability why don't you have that
 

6319
01:51:57,119 --> 01:51:59,270
repeatability why don't you have that
repeatability so

6320
01:51:59,270 --> 01:51:59,280
repeatability so
 

6321
01:51:59,280 --> 01:52:01,109
repeatability so
you clarify force controls you can grab

6322
01:52:01,109 --> 01:52:01,119
you clarify force controls you can grab
 

6323
01:52:01,119 --> 01:52:03,109
you clarify force controls you can grab
the arm and you can move it or you can

6324
01:52:03,109 --> 01:52:03,119
the arm and you can move it or you can
 

6325
01:52:03,119 --> 01:52:06,070
the arm and you can move it or you can
move it around but but suppose you um

6326
01:52:06,070 --> 01:52:06,080
move it around but but suppose you um
 

6327
01:52:06,080 --> 01:52:09,910
move it around but but suppose you um
can you see that yes suppose you want to

6328
01:52:09,910 --> 01:52:09,920
can you see that yes suppose you want to
 

6329
01:52:09,920 --> 01:52:11,109
can you see that yes suppose you want to
yes

6330
01:52:11,109 --> 01:52:11,119
yes
 

6331
01:52:11,119 --> 01:52:12,870
yes
suppose this this thing is a you know

6332
01:52:12,870 --> 01:52:12,880
suppose this this thing is a you know
 

6333
01:52:12,880 --> 01:52:15,030
suppose this this thing is a you know
precise thing that's going to fit here

6334
01:52:15,030 --> 01:52:15,040
precise thing that's going to fit here
 

6335
01:52:15,040 --> 01:52:16,629
precise thing that's going to fit here
in this right angle

6336
01:52:16,629 --> 01:52:16,639
in this right angle
 

6337
01:52:16,639 --> 01:52:19,109
in this right angle
um under position control you sent your

6338
01:52:19,109 --> 01:52:19,119
um under position control you sent your
 

6339
01:52:19,119 --> 01:52:21,430
um under position control you sent your
you you have fixtured where this is you

6340
01:52:21,430 --> 01:52:21,440
you you have fixtured where this is you
 

6341
01:52:21,440 --> 01:52:23,350
you you have fixtured where this is you
know where this is precisely and you

6342
01:52:23,350 --> 01:52:23,360
know where this is precisely and you
 

6343
01:52:23,360 --> 01:52:25,589
know where this is precisely and you
just move it open you know and it goes

6344
01:52:25,589 --> 01:52:25,599
just move it open you know and it goes
 

6345
01:52:25,599 --> 01:52:27,430
just move it open you know and it goes
there if force control you would do

6346
01:52:27,430 --> 01:52:27,440
there if force control you would do
 

6347
01:52:27,440 --> 01:52:28,550
there if force control you would do
something like

6348
01:52:28,550 --> 01:52:28,560
something like
 

6349
01:52:28,560 --> 01:52:30,470
something like
slidell over here till we feel that and

6350
01:52:30,470 --> 01:52:30,480
slidell over here till we feel that and
 

6351
01:52:30,480 --> 01:52:32,870
slidell over here till we feel that and
slide it in there and that's how a human

6352
01:52:32,870 --> 01:52:32,880
slide it in there and that's how a human
 

6353
01:52:32,880 --> 01:52:35,189
slide it in there and that's how a human
gets precise precision yeah they use

6354
01:52:35,189 --> 01:52:35,199
gets precise precision yeah they use
 

6355
01:52:35,199 --> 01:52:37,510
gets precise precision yeah they use
force feedback yes and get the things to

6356
01:52:37,510 --> 01:52:37,520
force feedback yes and get the things to
 

6357
01:52:37,520 --> 01:52:39,750
force feedback yes and get the things to
mate rather than just

6358
01:52:39,750 --> 01:52:39,760
mate rather than just
 

6359
01:52:39,760 --> 01:52:42,470
mate rather than just
go straight to it yeah

6360
01:52:42,470 --> 01:52:42,480
go straight to it yeah
 

6361
01:52:42,480 --> 01:52:45,109
go straight to it yeah
couldn't convince couldn't convince our

6362
01:52:45,109 --> 01:52:45,119
couldn't convince couldn't convince our
 

6363
01:52:45,119 --> 01:52:47,189
couldn't convince couldn't convince our
customers who were in factories and were

6364
01:52:47,189 --> 01:52:47,199
customers who were in factories and were
 

6365
01:52:47,199 --> 01:52:48,870
customers who were in factories and were
used to thinking about things a certain

6366
01:52:48,870 --> 01:52:48,880
used to thinking about things a certain
 

6367
01:52:48,880 --> 01:52:50,229
used to thinking about things a certain
way

6368
01:52:50,229 --> 01:52:50,239
way
 

6369
01:52:50,239 --> 01:52:52,229
way
and they wanted that one wonder so then

6370
01:52:52,229 --> 01:52:52,239
and they wanted that one wonder so then
 

6371
01:52:52,239 --> 01:52:54,790
and they wanted that one wonder so then
we said okay we're going to build an arm

6372
01:52:54,790 --> 01:52:54,800
we said okay we're going to build an arm
 

6373
01:52:54,800 --> 01:52:56,070
we said okay we're going to build an arm
that gives you that

6374
01:52:56,070 --> 01:52:56,080
that gives you that
 

6375
01:52:56,080 --> 01:52:58,390
that gives you that
so now we ended up building a 35 000

6376
01:52:58,390 --> 01:52:58,400
so now we ended up building a 35 000
 

6377
01:52:58,400 --> 01:53:00,870
so now we ended up building a 35 000
robot with one arm with um

6378
01:53:00,870 --> 01:53:00,880
robot with one arm with um
 

6379
01:53:00,880 --> 01:53:02,310
robot with one arm with um
um

6380
01:53:02,310 --> 01:53:02,320
um
 

6381
01:53:02,320 --> 01:53:05,910
um
oh what are they called um

6382
01:53:05,910 --> 01:53:05,920

 

6383
01:53:05,920 --> 01:53:07,270

um

6384
01:53:07,270 --> 01:53:07,280
um
 

6385
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:09,109
um
a certain sort of gearbox made by a

6386
01:53:09,109 --> 01:53:09,119
a certain sort of gearbox made by a
 

6387
01:53:09,119 --> 01:53:10,470
a certain sort of gearbox made by a
company whose name i can't remember

6388
01:53:10,470 --> 01:53:10,480
company whose name i can't remember
 

6389
01:53:10,480 --> 01:53:11,589
company whose name i can't remember
right now but it's the name of the

6390
01:53:11,589 --> 01:53:11,599
right now but it's the name of the
 

6391
01:53:11,599 --> 01:53:12,550
right now but it's the name of the
gearbox

6392
01:53:12,550 --> 01:53:12,560
gearbox
 

6393
01:53:12,560 --> 01:53:13,510
gearbox
um

6394
01:53:13,510 --> 01:53:13,520
um
 

6395
01:53:13,520 --> 01:53:15,990
um
and um but it's it's

6396
01:53:15,990 --> 01:53:16,000
and um but it's it's
 

6397
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:17,990
and um but it's it's
got torque ripple in it

6398
01:53:17,990 --> 01:53:18,000
got torque ripple in it
 

6399
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:19,910
got torque ripple in it
so now there was an extra two years of

6400
01:53:19,910 --> 01:53:19,920
so now there was an extra two years of
 

6401
01:53:19,920 --> 01:53:21,589
so now there was an extra two years of
solving the problem of doing the force

6402
01:53:21,589 --> 01:53:21,599
solving the problem of doing the force
 

6403
01:53:21,599 --> 01:53:24,390
solving the problem of doing the force
with the talk ripple so we had to do the

6404
01:53:24,390 --> 01:53:24,400
with the talk ripple so we had to do the
 

6405
01:53:24,400 --> 01:53:27,750
with the talk ripple so we had to do the
the thing we had avoided

6406
01:53:27,750 --> 01:53:27,760
the thing we had avoided
 

6407
01:53:27,760 --> 01:53:28,470
the thing we had avoided
and

6408
01:53:28,470 --> 01:53:28,480
and
 

6409
01:53:28,480 --> 01:53:30,229
and
for the plastic gearboxes we ended up

6410
01:53:30,229 --> 01:53:30,239
for the plastic gearboxes we ended up
 

6411
01:53:30,239 --> 01:53:32,229
for the plastic gearboxes we ended up
having to do the robot was now

6412
01:53:32,229 --> 01:53:32,239
having to do the robot was now
 

6413
01:53:32,239 --> 01:53:34,390
having to do the robot was now
overpriced and

6414
01:53:34,390 --> 01:53:34,400
overpriced and
 

6415
01:53:34,400 --> 01:53:36,709
overpriced and
um they and that was your intuition from

6416
01:53:36,709 --> 01:53:36,719
um they and that was your intuition from
 

6417
01:53:36,719 --> 01:53:38,470
um they and that was your intuition from
the very beginning kind of that this is

6418
01:53:38,470 --> 01:53:38,480
the very beginning kind of that this is
 

6419
01:53:38,480 --> 01:53:40,070
the very beginning kind of that this is
not

6420
01:53:40,070 --> 01:53:40,080
not
 

6421
01:53:40,080 --> 01:53:42,310
not
you're opening a door to to solve a lot

6422
01:53:42,310 --> 01:53:42,320
you're opening a door to to solve a lot
 

6423
01:53:42,320 --> 01:53:43,830
you're opening a door to to solve a lot
of problems that you're you're

6424
01:53:43,830 --> 01:53:43,840
of problems that you're you're
 

6425
01:53:43,840 --> 01:53:44,950
of problems that you're you're
eventually going to have to solve this

6426
01:53:44,950 --> 01:53:44,960
eventually going to have to solve this
 

6427
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:47,189
eventually going to have to solve this
problem anyway yeah and also i was

6428
01:53:47,189 --> 01:53:47,199
problem anyway yeah and also i was
 

6429
01:53:47,199 --> 01:53:48,709
problem anyway yeah and also i was
aiming at a low price to go into a

6430
01:53:48,709 --> 01:53:48,719
aiming at a low price to go into a
 

6431
01:53:48,719 --> 01:53:50,709
aiming at a low price to go into a
different market price that that didn't

6432
01:53:50,709 --> 01:53:50,719
different market price that that didn't
 

6433
01:53:50,719 --> 01:53:52,550
different market price that that didn't
have a thousand dollars would be amazing

6434
01:53:52,550 --> 01:53:52,560
have a thousand dollars would be amazing
 

6435
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:53,830
have a thousand dollars would be amazing
yeah i think we could have done it for

6436
01:53:53,830 --> 01:53:53,840
yeah i think we could have done it for
 

6437
01:53:53,840 --> 01:53:56,070
yeah i think we could have done it for
five um but

6438
01:53:56,070 --> 01:53:56,080
five um but
 

6439
01:53:56,080 --> 01:53:57,750
five um but
you know you said talked about

6440
01:53:57,750 --> 01:53:57,760
you know you said talked about
 

6441
01:53:57,760 --> 01:53:59,350
you know you said talked about
setting the goal a little too far for

6442
01:53:59,350 --> 01:53:59,360
setting the goal a little too far for
 

6443
01:53:59,360 --> 01:54:03,030
setting the goal a little too far for
the engineers exactly

6444
01:54:03,030 --> 01:54:03,040

 

6445
01:54:03,040 --> 01:54:06,790

so why would you say that company um

6446
01:54:06,790 --> 01:54:06,800
so why would you say that company um
 

6447
01:54:06,800 --> 01:54:09,990
so why would you say that company um
not failed but went under

6448
01:54:09,990 --> 01:54:10,000
not failed but went under
 

6449
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:13,830
not failed but went under
we had buyers and um

6450
01:54:13,830 --> 01:54:13,840
we had buyers and um
 

6451
01:54:13,840 --> 01:54:15,189
we had buyers and um
there's this thing called the committee

6452
01:54:15,189 --> 01:54:15,199
there's this thing called the committee
 

6453
01:54:15,199 --> 01:54:19,189
there's this thing called the committee
on foreign investment in the us cyphus

6454
01:54:19,189 --> 01:54:19,199
on foreign investment in the us cyphus
 

6455
01:54:19,199 --> 01:54:22,229
on foreign investment in the us cyphus
and um that had previously been invoked

6456
01:54:22,229 --> 01:54:22,239
and um that had previously been invoked
 

6457
01:54:22,239 --> 01:54:24,550
and um that had previously been invoked
twice

6458
01:54:24,550 --> 01:54:24,560
twice
 

6459
01:54:24,560 --> 01:54:27,270
twice
around where the government could stop

6460
01:54:27,270 --> 01:54:27,280
around where the government could stop
 

6461
01:54:27,280 --> 01:54:30,149
around where the government could stop
foreign money coming into a u.s company

6462
01:54:30,149 --> 01:54:30,159
foreign money coming into a u.s company
 

6463
01:54:30,159 --> 01:54:32,550
foreign money coming into a u.s company
based on

6464
01:54:32,550 --> 01:54:32,560
based on
 

6465
01:54:32,560 --> 01:54:35,830
based on
defense requirements

6466
01:54:35,830 --> 01:54:35,840
defense requirements
 

6467
01:54:35,840 --> 01:54:37,270
defense requirements

out on the street
 

6539
01:55:55,760 --> 01:55:59,589
out on the street
so baxter has a screen with a face

6540
01:55:59,589 --> 01:55:59,599
so baxter has a screen with a face
 

6541
01:55:59,599 --> 01:56:00,870
so baxter has a screen with a face
what uh

6542
01:56:00,870 --> 01:56:00,880
what uh
 

6543
01:56:00,880 --> 01:56:03,350
what uh
that's the revolutionary idea for a uh

6544
01:56:03,350 --> 01:56:03,360
that's the revolutionary idea for a uh
 

6545
01:56:03,360 --> 01:56:05,669
that's the revolutionary idea for a uh
robot manipulation like for a robotic

6546
01:56:05,669 --> 01:56:05,679
robot manipulation like for a robotic
 

6547
01:56:05,679 --> 01:56:06,470
robot manipulation like for a robotic
arm

6548
01:56:06,470 --> 01:56:06,480
arm
 

6549
01:56:06,480 --> 01:56:07,669
arm
uh what

6550
01:56:07,669 --> 01:56:07,679
uh what
 

6551
01:56:07,679 --> 01:56:09,430
uh what
proposition did you get well first the

6552
01:56:09,430 --> 01:56:09,440
proposition did you get well first the
 

6553
01:56:09,440 --> 01:56:11,990
proposition did you get well first the
screen was also used during um

6554
01:56:11,990 --> 01:56:12,000
screen was also used during um
 

6555
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:13,750
screen was also used during um
codeless programming where you taught by

6556
01:56:13,750 --> 01:56:13,760
codeless programming where you taught by
 

6557
01:56:13,760 --> 01:56:15,589
codeless programming where you taught by
demonstration it showed you what its

6558
01:56:15,589 --> 01:56:15,599
demonstration it showed you what its
 

6559
01:56:15,599 --> 01:56:17,669
demonstration it showed you what its
understanding of the task was

6560
01:56:17,669 --> 01:56:17,679
understanding of the task was
 

6561
01:56:17,679 --> 01:56:19,270
understanding of the task was
so it had two roles

6562
01:56:19,270 --> 01:56:19,280
so it had two roles
 

6563
01:56:19,280 --> 01:56:21,270
so it had two roles
um

6564
01:56:21,270 --> 01:56:21,280
um
 

6565
01:56:21,280 --> 01:56:23,350
um
some customers hated it

6566
01:56:23,350 --> 01:56:23,360
some customers hated it
 

6567
01:56:23,360 --> 01:56:25,750
some customers hated it
and so we made it so that when the robot

6568
01:56:25,750 --> 01:56:25,760
and so we made it so that when the robot
 

6569
01:56:25,760 --> 01:56:27,430
and so we made it so that when the robot
was running it could be showing graphs

6570
01:56:27,430 --> 01:56:27,440
was running it could be showing graphs
 

6571
01:56:27,440 --> 01:56:29,589
was running it could be showing graphs
of what was happening i'm not sure the

6572

to roboticists

6592
01:56:51,910 --> 01:56:51,920
to roboticists
 

6593
01:56:51,920 --> 01:56:53,669
to roboticists
like the best robotics people in the

6594
01:56:53,669 --> 01:56:53,679
like the best robotics people in the
 

6595
01:56:53,679 --> 01:56:55,350
like the best robotics people in the
world they seem to not want to do the

6596

6599
01:56:58,239 --> 01:56:59,589
eyes type of thing like they seem to see
it as a machine

6600
01:56:59,589 --> 01:56:59,599
it as a machine
 

6601
01:56:59,599 --> 01:57:01,030
it as a machine
as opposed to a machine that can also

6602
01:57:01,030 --> 01:57:01,040
as opposed to a machine that can also
 

6603
01:57:01,040 --> 01:57:02,709
as opposed to a machine that can also
have a human connection

6604
01:57:02,709 --> 01:57:02,719
have a human connection
 

6605
01:57:02,719 --> 01:57:03,990

the trillion dollar company
will have to do the human connection

6612
01:57:09,669 --> 01:57:09,679
will have to do the human connection
 

6613
01:57:09,679 --> 01:57:11,669
will have to do the human connection
very well no matter what it does yeah i

critical of the idea of the touring test
as a test of intelligence

6630
01:57:32,229 --> 01:57:32,239

 

6631
01:57:32,239 --> 01:57:34,310

let me first ask this question

6632
01:57:34,310 --> 01:57:34,320
let me first ask this question
 

6633
01:57:34,320 --> 01:57:36,709
let me first ask this question
do you think we'll be able to build

6634
01:57:36,709 --> 01:57:36,719
do you think we'll be able to build
 

6635
01:57:36,719 --> 01:57:38,550
do you think we'll be able to build
an ai system

6636
01:57:38,550 --> 01:57:38,560
an ai system
 

6637
01:57:38,560 --> 01:57:40,950
an ai system
that humans fall in love with and it

6638
01:57:40,950 --> 01:57:40,960
that humans fall in love with and it
 

6639
01:57:40,960 --> 01:57:43,350
that humans fall in love with and it
falls in love with the human

6640
01:57:43,350 --> 01:57:43,360
falls in love with the human
 

6641
01:57:43,360 --> 01:57:47,510
falls in love with the human
like romantic love

6642
01:57:47,510 --> 01:57:47,520

 

6643
01:57:47,520 --> 01:57:49,510

but we've had that with humans falling

6644
01:57:49,510 --> 01:57:49,520
but we've had that with humans falling
 

6645
01:57:49,520 --> 01:57:52,149
but we've had that with humans falling
in love with cars even back in the 50s

6646
01:57:52,149 --> 01:57:52,159
in love with cars even back in the 50s
 

6647
01:57:52,159 --> 01:57:54,149
in love with cars even back in the 50s
it's a different love right well i think

6648
01:57:54,149 --> 01:57:54,159
it's a different love right well i think
 

6649
01:57:54,159 --> 01:57:56,149
it's a different love right well i think
i think there's a lifelong partnership

6650
01:57:56,149 --> 01:57:56,159
i think there's a lifelong partnership
 

6651
01:57:56,159 --> 01:57:57,430
i think there's a lifelong partnership
where you uh

6652
01:57:57,430 --> 01:57:57,440
where you uh
 

6653
01:57:57,440 --> 01:58:00,149
where you uh
can communicate and grow like

6654
01:58:00,149 --> 01:58:00,159
can communicate and grow like
 

6655
01:58:00,159 --> 01:58:02,390
can communicate and grow like
i think we're a long way from that

6656
01:58:02,390 --> 01:58:02,400
i think we're a long way from that
 

6657
01:58:02,400 --> 01:58:05,430
i think we're a long way from that
i think we're a long long way i think

6658
01:58:05,430 --> 01:58:05,440
i think we're a long long way i think
 

6659
01:58:05,440 --> 01:58:06,470
i think we're a long long way i think
uh

6660
01:58:06,470 --> 01:58:06,480
uh
 

6661
01:58:06,480 --> 01:58:08,390
uh
blade runner was you know had the time

6662
01:58:08,390 --> 01:58:08,400
blade runner was you know had the time
 

6663
01:58:08,400 --> 01:58:10,070
blade runner was you know had the time
scale totally wrong

6664
01:58:10,070 --> 01:58:10,080
scale totally wrong
 

6665
01:58:10,080 --> 01:58:11,669
scale totally wrong
um

6666
01:58:11,669 --> 01:58:11,679
um
 

6667
01:58:11,679 --> 01:58:13,030
um
yeah but

6668
01:58:13,030 --> 01:58:13,040
yeah but
 

6669
01:58:13,040 --> 01:58:14,950
yeah but
do you so uh

6670
01:58:14,950 --> 01:58:14,960
do you so uh
 

6671
01:58:14,960 --> 01:58:16,470
do you so uh
to me honestly the most difficult part

6672
01:58:16,470 --> 01:58:16,480
to me honestly the most difficult part
 

6673
01:58:16,480 --> 01:58:17,669
to me honestly the most difficult part
is the thing that you said with the

6674
01:58:17,669 --> 01:58:17,679
is the thing that you said with the
 

6675
01:58:17,679 --> 01:58:20,709
is the thing that you said with the
marvex paradox is to create a human form

6676
01:58:20,709 --> 01:58:20,719
marvex paradox is to create a human form
 

6677
01:58:20,719 --> 01:58:22,629
marvex paradox is to create a human form
that interacts and perceives the world

6678
01:58:22,629 --> 01:58:22,639
that interacts and perceives the world
 

6679
01:58:22,639 --> 01:58:24,629
that interacts and perceives the world
but if we just look at a voice

6680
01:58:24,629 --> 01:58:24,639
but if we just look at a voice
 

6681
01:58:24,639 --> 01:58:27,669
but if we just look at a voice
like the movie her or just like an alexa

6682
01:58:27,669 --> 01:58:27,679
like the movie her or just like an alexa
 

6683
01:58:27,679 --> 01:58:28,870
like the movie her or just like an alexa
type voice

6684
01:58:28,870 --> 01:58:28,880
type voice
 

6685
01:58:28,880 --> 01:58:32,550
type voice
i tend to think we're not that far away

6686
01:58:32,550 --> 01:58:32,560
i tend to think we're not that far away
 

6687
01:58:32,560 --> 01:58:35,350
i tend to think we're not that far away
well for some for some people maybe not

6688
01:58:35,350 --> 01:58:35,360
well for some for some people maybe not
 

6689
01:58:35,360 --> 01:58:37,589
well for some for some people maybe not
but i i

6690
01:58:37,589 --> 01:58:37,599
but i i
 

6691
01:58:37,599 --> 01:58:43,189
but i i
you know i i

6692
01:58:43,189 --> 01:58:43,199

 

6693
01:58:43,199 --> 01:58:44,950

you know as humans as we think about the

6694
01:58:44,950 --> 01:58:44,960
you know as humans as we think about the
 

6695
01:58:44,960 --> 01:58:46,790
you know as humans as we think about the
future we always try to

6696
01:58:46,790 --> 01:58:46,800
future we always try to
 

6697
01:58:46,800 --> 01:58:48,629
future we always try to
and this is the premise of most science

6698
01:58:48,629 --> 01:58:48,639
and this is the premise of most science
 

6699
01:58:48,639 --> 01:58:50,470
and this is the premise of most science
fiction movies you've got the world

6700
01:58:50,470 --> 01:58:50,480
fiction movies you've got the world
 

6701
01:58:50,480 --> 01:58:53,189
fiction movies you've got the world
justices today and you change one thing

6702
01:58:53,189 --> 01:58:53,199
justices today and you change one thing
 

6703
01:58:53,199 --> 01:58:55,430
justices today and you change one thing
right but that's not how and it's the

6704
01:58:55,430 --> 01:58:55,440
right but that's not how and it's the
 

6705
01:58:55,440 --> 01:58:57,109
right but that's not how and it's the
same with a self-driving car you change

6706
01:58:57,109 --> 01:58:57,119
same with a self-driving car you change
 

6707
01:58:57,119 --> 01:58:59,990
same with a self-driving car you change
one thing no you everything changes yes

6708
01:58:59,990 --> 01:59:00,000
one thing no you everything changes yes
 

6709
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:01,270
one thing no you everything changes yes
everything

6710
01:59:01,270 --> 01:59:01,280
everything
 

6711
01:59:01,280 --> 01:59:04,550
everything
grows together so surprisingly i might

6712
01:59:04,550 --> 01:59:04,560
grows together so surprisingly i might
 

6713
01:59:04,560 --> 01:59:05,910
grows together so surprisingly i might
be surprising to you or might not i

6714
01:59:05,910 --> 01:59:05,920
be surprising to you or might not i
 

6715
01:59:05,920 --> 01:59:09,030
be surprising to you or might not i
think the best movie about this stuff

6716
01:59:09,030 --> 01:59:09,040
think the best movie about this stuff
 

6717
01:59:09,040 --> 01:59:11,830
think the best movie about this stuff
was bicentennial man

6718
01:59:11,830 --> 01:59:11,840
was bicentennial man
 

6719
01:59:11,840 --> 01:59:14,070
was bicentennial man
and what was happening there um it was

6720
01:59:14,070 --> 01:59:14,080
and what was happening there um it was
 

6721
01:59:14,080 --> 01:59:16,310
and what was happening there um it was
schmaltzy and you know but what was

6722
01:59:16,310 --> 01:59:16,320
schmaltzy and you know but what was
 

6723
01:59:16,320 --> 01:59:18,470
schmaltzy and you know but what was
happening there

6724
01:59:18,470 --> 01:59:18,480
happening there
 

6725
01:59:18,480 --> 01:59:20,629
happening there
as the robot was trying to become more

6726
01:59:20,629 --> 01:59:20,639
as the robot was trying to become more
 

6727
01:59:20,639 --> 01:59:21,589
as the robot was trying to become more
human

6728
01:59:21,589 --> 01:59:21,599
human
 

6729
01:59:21,599 --> 01:59:23,669
human
the humans were adopting the technology

6730
01:59:23,669 --> 01:59:23,679
the humans were adopting the technology
 

6731
01:59:23,679 --> 01:59:25,510
the humans were adopting the technology
of the robot and changing their bodies

6732
01:59:25,510 --> 01:59:25,520
of the robot and changing their bodies
 

6733
01:59:25,520 --> 01:59:27,510
of the robot and changing their bodies
yeah so there was a convergence

6734
01:59:27,510 --> 01:59:27,520
yeah so there was a convergence
 

6735
01:59:27,520 --> 01:59:28,470
yeah so there was a convergence
happening

6736
01:59:28,470 --> 01:59:28,480
happening
 

6737
01:59:28,480 --> 01:59:30,149
happening
in

6738
01:59:30,149 --> 01:59:30,159
in
 

6739
01:59:30,159 --> 01:59:31,669
in
so we will not be the same you know

6740
01:59:31,669 --> 01:59:31,679
so we will not be the same you know
 

6741
01:59:31,679 --> 01:59:33,350
so we will not be the same you know
we're already talking about uh

6742
01:59:33,350 --> 01:59:33,360
we're already talking about uh
 

6743
01:59:33,360 --> 01:59:35,350
we're already talking about uh
genetically modifying our babies you

6744
01:59:35,350 --> 01:59:35,360
genetically modifying our babies you
 

6745
01:59:35,360 --> 01:59:36,390
genetically modifying our babies you
know there's a

6746
01:59:36,390 --> 01:59:36,400
know there's a
 

6747
01:59:36,400 --> 01:59:37,510
know there's a
there's

6748
01:59:37,510 --> 01:59:37,520
there's
 

6749
01:59:37,520 --> 01:59:39,030
there's
more and more stuff happening around

6750
01:59:39,030 --> 01:59:39,040
more and more stuff happening around
 

6751
01:59:39,040 --> 01:59:39,750
more and more stuff happening around
that

6752
01:59:39,750 --> 01:59:39,760
that
 

6753
01:59:39,760 --> 01:59:42,470
that
we will we will want to modify ourselves

6754
01:59:42,470 --> 01:59:42,480
we will we will want to modify ourselves
 

6755
01:59:42,480 --> 01:59:46,149
we will we will want to modify ourselves
even more for all sorts of of things

6756
01:59:46,149 --> 01:59:46,159
even more for all sorts of of things
 

6757
01:59:46,159 --> 01:59:47,589
even more for all sorts of of things
we put

6758
01:59:47,589 --> 01:59:47,599
we put
 

6759
01:59:47,599 --> 01:59:50,390
we put
all sorts of technology in our bodies um

6760
01:59:50,390 --> 01:59:50,400
all sorts of technology in our bodies um
 

6761
01:59:50,400 --> 01:59:52,550
all sorts of technology in our bodies um
to improve it you know

6762
01:59:52,550 --> 01:59:52,560
to improve it you know
 

6763
01:59:52,560 --> 01:59:54,310
to improve it you know
i've got

6764
01:59:54,310 --> 01:59:54,320
i've got
 

6765
01:59:54,320 --> 01:59:56,390
i've got
i've got things in my ears so that i can

6766
01:59:56,390 --> 01:59:56,400
i've got things in my ears so that i can
 

6767
01:59:56,400 --> 01:59:59,350
i've got things in my ears so that i can
sort of hear you yeah

6768
01:59:59,350 --> 01:59:59,360
sort of hear you yeah
 

6769
01:59:59,360 --> 02:00:01,109
sort of hear you yeah
yeah so we're always modifying our

6770
02:00:01,109 --> 02:00:01,119
yeah so we're always modifying our
 

6771
02:00:01,119 --> 02:00:02,149
yeah so we're always modifying our
bodies so

6772
02:00:02,149 --> 02:00:02,159
bodies so
 

6773
02:00:02,159 --> 02:00:04,149
bodies so
so you know i think it's hard to imagine

6774
02:00:04,149 --> 02:00:04,159
so you know i think it's hard to imagine
 

6775
02:00:04,159 --> 02:00:05,990
so you know i think it's hard to imagine
exactly what it would be like in the

6776
02:00:05,990 --> 02:00:06,000
exactly what it would be like in the
 

6777
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:07,589
exactly what it would be like in the
future

6778
02:00:07,589 --> 02:00:07,599
future
 

6779
02:00:07,599 --> 02:00:09,830
future
but on the turin test side

6780
02:00:09,830 --> 02:00:09,840
but on the turin test side
 

6781
02:00:09,840 --> 02:00:12,149
but on the turin test side
do you think uh so forget about love for

6782
02:00:12,149 --> 02:00:12,159
do you think uh so forget about love for
 

6783
02:00:12,159 --> 02:00:13,270
do you think uh so forget about love for
a second

6784
02:00:13,270 --> 02:00:13,280
a second
 

6785
02:00:13,280 --> 02:00:15,669
a second
let's talk about just uh like the elect

6786
02:00:15,669 --> 02:00:15,679
let's talk about just uh like the elect
 

6787
02:00:15,679 --> 02:00:19,589
let's talk about just uh like the elect
surprise actually i was invited to be uh

6788
02:00:19,589 --> 02:00:19,599
surprise actually i was invited to be uh
 

6789
02:00:19,599 --> 02:00:21,350
surprise actually i was invited to be uh
what is the interviewer for the alexa

6790
02:00:21,350 --> 02:00:21,360
what is the interviewer for the alexa
 

6791
02:00:21,360 --> 02:00:23,109
what is the interviewer for the alexa
prize or whatever um

6792

an ai system for a prolonged period of
 

6805
02:00:32,800 --> 02:00:35,109
an ai system for a prolonged period of
time like 20 minutes

how far away are we

6808
02:00:37,830 --> 02:00:37,840
how far away are we
 

6809
02:00:37,840 --> 02:00:40,390
how far away are we
and why is it difficult to build an ai

6810
02:00:40,390 --> 02:00:40,400
and why is it difficult to build an ai
 

6811
02:00:40,400 --> 02:00:42,629
and why is it difficult to build an ai
system with which you'd want to have a

in the 70s typing you know stuff to
 

6835
02:01:07,280 --> 02:01:09,750
in the 70s typing you know stuff to
eliza see what it would come back with

02:01:55,270 --> 02:01:55,280
not saying this can't be done i'm just
 

6885
02:01:55,280 --> 02:01:57,510
not saying this can't be done i'm just
saying i think this is why we don't feel

what it
 

6907
02:02:13,920 --> 02:02:16,709
what it
feels like i tend to be i tend to think

02:02:19,750 --> 02:02:19,760
it's uh it's not
 

6911
02:02:19,760 --> 02:02:21,589
it's uh it's not
as difficult as solving intelligence for

as difficult as solving intelligence for

example
 

6915
02:02:22,719 --> 02:02:24,870
example
and i think it's achievable in the near

6916
02:02:24,870 --> 02:02:24,880
and i think it's achievable in the near
 

6917
02:02:24,880 --> 02:02:27,430
and i think it's achievable in the near
term

but on the touring test
 

6921
02:02:29,679 --> 02:02:31,589

why don't you think the turing test is a

02:02:31,589 --> 02:02:31,599
why don't you think the turing test is a
 

6923
02:02:31,599 --> 02:02:34,229
why don't you think the turing test is a
good test of intelligence oh i i because

6924
02:02:34,229 --> 02:02:34,239
good test of intelligence oh i i because
 

6925
02:02:34,239 --> 02:02:35,589
good test of intelligence oh i i because
you know

6926
02:02:35,589 --> 02:02:35,599
you know
 

6927
02:02:35,599 --> 02:02:38,229
you know
again the turing if you read the paper

6928
02:02:38,229 --> 02:02:38,239
again the turing if you read the paper
 

6929
02:02:38,239 --> 02:02:40,470
again the turing if you read the paper
turing wasn't saying this is a good test

6930
02:02:40,470 --> 02:02:40,480
turing wasn't saying this is a good test
 

6931
02:02:40,480 --> 02:02:43,189
turing wasn't saying this is a good test
he was using as a rhetorical device to

02:02:43,189 --> 02:02:43,199
he was using as a rhetorical device to
 

6933
02:02:43,199 --> 02:02:44,950
he was using as a rhetorical device to
argue

6934

argue
 

6935
02:02:44,960 --> 02:02:46,470
argue
that if you can't tell the difference

6936
02:02:46,470 --> 02:02:46,480
that if you can't tell the difference
 

6937
02:02:46,480 --> 02:02:49,270
that if you can't tell the difference
between a computer and a person

between a computer and a person
 

6939
02:02:49,280 --> 02:02:51,350
between a computer and a person
you must say that the computer's

6940
02:02:51,350 --> 02:02:51,360
you must say that the computer's
 

6941
02:02:51,360 --> 02:02:52,870
you must say that the computer's
thinking because

6942

thinking because
 

6943
02:02:52,880 --> 02:02:54,870
thinking because
you can't tell the difference you know

6944
02:02:54,870 --> 02:02:54,880
you can't tell the difference you know
 

6945
02:02:54,880 --> 02:02:57,430
you can't tell the difference you know
when it's thinking you can't you can't

6946
02:02:57,430 --> 02:02:57,440
when it's thinking you can't you can't
 

6947
02:02:57,440 --> 02:02:58,870
when it's thinking you can't you can't
say something different

6948
02:02:58,870 --> 02:02:58,880
say something different
 

6949
02:02:58,880 --> 02:03:01,669

um what it has become as this sort of
 

6951
02:03:01,679 --> 02:03:05,350
um what it has become as this sort of
weird game of fooling people um

so you know
 

7025
02:04:16,320 --> 02:04:18,310
so you know
that's what that's what the turing test

first a disappointment in myself
you know as i've been researching this

7116
02:05:57,830 --> 02:05:57,840
you know as i've been researching this
 

7117
02:05:57,840 --> 02:06:01,589
you know as i've been researching this
book um and so many of the players you

7118
02:06:01,589 --> 02:06:01,599
book um and so many of the players you
 

7119
02:06:01,599 --> 02:06:05,109
book um and so many of the players you
know were active in the 50s and 60s i

7120
02:06:05,109 --> 02:06:05,119
know were active in the 50s and 60s i
 

7121
02:06:05,119 --> 02:06:06,950
know were active in the 50s and 60s i
knew many of them when they were older

7122
02:06:06,950 --> 02:06:06,960
knew many of them when they were older
 

7123
02:06:06,960 --> 02:06:08,550
knew many of them when they were older
and i didn't ask them all the questions

7124
02:06:08,550 --> 02:06:08,560
and i didn't ask them all the questions
 

7125
02:06:08,560 --> 02:06:09,750
and i didn't ask them all the questions
now i wish

7126
02:06:09,750 --> 02:06:09,760
now i wish
 

7127
02:06:09,760 --> 02:06:11,270
now i wish
i had asked

7128
02:06:11,270 --> 02:06:11,280
i had asked
 

7129
02:06:11,280 --> 02:06:13,109
i had asked
i'd sit with them at our thursday

7130
02:06:13,109 --> 02:06:13,119
i'd sit with them at our thursday
 

7131
02:06:13,119 --> 02:06:15,350
i'd sit with them at our thursday
lunches which we had a faculty lunch and

7132
02:06:15,350 --> 02:06:15,360
lunches which we had a faculty lunch and
 

7133
02:06:15,360 --> 02:06:17,910
lunches which we had a faculty lunch and
and i didn't ask him so many questions

7134
02:06:17,910 --> 02:06:17,920
and i didn't ask him so many questions
 

7135
02:06:17,920 --> 02:06:20,390
and i didn't ask him so many questions
that now i wish i had he asked you that

7136
02:06:20,390 --> 02:06:20,400
that now i wish i had he asked you that
 

7137
02:06:20,400 --> 02:06:22,390
that now i wish i had he asked you that
question because because you wrote that

7138
02:06:22,390 --> 02:06:22,400
question because because you wrote that
 

7139
02:06:22,400 --> 02:06:23,750
question because because you wrote that
you wrote that you were fortunate to

7140

you wrote that you were fortunate to
 

7141
02:06:23,760 --> 02:06:25,350

greats
those who founded ai robotics and

7146
02:06:28,390 --> 02:06:28,400
those who founded ai robotics and
 

7147
02:06:28,400 --> 02:06:31,350
those who founded ai robotics and
computer science and the world wide web

7148
02:06:31,350 --> 02:06:31,360
computer science and the world wide web
 

7149

and you wrote that your big regret

7150
02:06:33,030 --> 02:06:33,040
and you wrote that your big regret
 

7151
02:06:33,040 --> 02:06:34,950
and you wrote that your big regret
nowadays is that often i have questions

7152
02:06:34,950 --> 02:06:34,960
nowadays is that often i have questions
 

7153
02:06:34,960 --> 02:06:37,750
nowadays is that often i have questions
for those who have passed on yeah and i

7154
02:06:37,750 --> 02:06:37,760
for those who have passed on yeah and i
 

7155
02:06:37,760 --> 02:06:39,750
for those who have passed on yeah and i
didn't think to ask them any of these

7156
02:06:39,750 --> 02:06:39,760
didn't think to ask them any of these
 

7157
02:06:39,760 --> 02:06:41,430
didn't think to ask them any of these
questions right

7158
02:06:41,430 --> 02:06:41,440
questions right
 

7159
02:06:41,440 --> 02:06:43,510
questions right
even as i saw them and said hello to

7160
02:06:43,510 --> 02:06:43,520
even as i saw them and said hello to
 

7161
02:06:43,520 --> 02:06:45,990
even as i saw them and said hello to
them on a daily basis so

7162
02:06:45,990 --> 02:06:46,000
them on a daily basis so
 

7163
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:47,830
them on a daily basis so
maybe also another question i want to

7164
02:06:47,830 --> 02:06:47,840
maybe also another question i want to
 

7165
02:06:47,840 --> 02:06:49,030
maybe also another question i want to
ask

7166
02:06:49,030 --> 02:06:49,040
ask
 

7167
02:06:49,040 --> 02:06:51,350
ask
if you could talk to them today what

7168
02:06:51,350 --> 02:06:51,360
if you could talk to them today what
 

7169
02:06:51,360 --> 02:06:53,350
if you could talk to them today what
question would you ask what questions

7170
02:06:53,350 --> 02:06:53,360
question would you ask what questions
 

7171
02:06:53,360 --> 02:06:56,470
question would you ask what questions
would you ask well rick lyder i i would

7172
02:06:56,470 --> 02:06:56,480
would you ask well rick lyder i i would
 

7173
02:06:56,480 --> 02:06:59,430
would you ask well rick lyder i i would
ask him you know he had the vision for

7174
02:06:59,430 --> 02:06:59,440
ask him you know he had the vision for
 

7175
02:06:59,440 --> 02:07:01,350
ask him you know he had the vision for
humans and and

7176
02:07:01,350 --> 02:07:01,360
humans and and
 

7177
02:07:01,360 --> 02:07:03,589
humans and and
computers working together and he really

7178
02:07:03,589 --> 02:07:03,599
computers working together and he really
 

7179
02:07:03,599 --> 02:07:06,470
computers working together and he really
founded that at darpa and he

7180
02:07:06,470 --> 02:07:06,480
founded that at darpa and he
 

7181
02:07:06,480 --> 02:07:09,270
founded that at darpa and he
gave the money to mit which started

7182
02:07:09,270 --> 02:07:09,280
gave the money to mit which started
 

7183
02:07:09,280 --> 02:07:13,270
gave the money to mit which started
project mac in 1963.

7184
02:07:13,270 --> 02:07:13,280
project mac in 1963.
 

7185
02:07:13,280 --> 02:07:14,950
project mac in 1963.
and i i would have talked about what

7186
02:07:14,950 --> 02:07:14,960
and i i would have talked about what
 

7187
02:07:14,960 --> 02:07:16,470
and i i would have talked about what
what the successes were what the

7188
02:07:16,470 --> 02:07:16,480
what the successes were what the
 

7189
02:07:16,480 --> 02:07:19,189
what the successes were what the
failures were what he saw as progress

7190
02:07:19,189 --> 02:07:19,199
failures were what he saw as progress
 

7191
02:07:19,199 --> 02:07:21,430
failures were what he saw as progress
et cetera

7192
02:07:21,430 --> 02:07:21,440
et cetera
 

7193
02:07:21,440 --> 02:07:22,790
et cetera
i would have asked him more more

7194
02:07:22,790 --> 02:07:22,800
i would have asked him more more
 

7195
02:07:22,800 --> 02:07:25,589
i would have asked him more more
questions about that because now i could

7196
02:07:25,589 --> 02:07:25,599
questions about that because now i could
 

7197
02:07:25,599 --> 02:07:27,510
questions about that because now i could
use it in my book

7198
02:07:27,510 --> 02:07:27,520
use it in my book
 

7199
02:07:27,520 --> 02:07:29,350
use it in my book
but i think it's lost it's lost forever

7200
02:07:29,350 --> 02:07:29,360
but i think it's lost it's lost forever
 

7201
02:07:29,360 --> 02:07:31,750
but i think it's lost it's lost forever
a lot of the motivations are lost

7202
02:07:31,750 --> 02:07:31,760
a lot of the motivations are lost
 

7203
02:07:31,760 --> 02:07:34,390
a lot of the motivations are lost
um

7204
02:07:34,390 --> 02:07:34,400

 

7205
02:07:34,400 --> 02:07:35,510

uh

7206
02:07:35,510 --> 02:07:35,520
uh
 

7207
02:07:35,520 --> 02:07:38,790
uh
i i should have asked marvin why he he

7208
02:07:38,790 --> 02:07:38,800
i i should have asked marvin why he he
 

7209
02:07:38,800 --> 02:07:40,629
i i should have asked marvin why he he
and seymour pappet

7210
02:07:40,629 --> 02:07:40,639
and seymour pappet
 

7211
02:07:40,639 --> 02:07:43,709
and seymour pappet
came down so hard on neural networks in

7212
02:07:43,709 --> 02:07:43,719
came down so hard on neural networks in
 

7213
02:07:43,719 --> 02:07:47,030
came down so hard on neural networks in
1968 in their book perceptrons because

7214
02:07:47,030 --> 02:07:47,040
1968 in their book perceptrons because
 

7215
02:07:47,040 --> 02:07:49,030
1968 in their book perceptrons because
marvin's phd thesis was on neural

7216
02:07:49,030 --> 02:07:49,040
marvin's phd thesis was on neural
 

7217
02:07:49,040 --> 02:07:51,109
marvin's phd thesis was on neural
networks yeah how do you make sense of

7218
02:07:51,109 --> 02:07:51,119
networks yeah how do you make sense of
 

7219
02:07:51,119 --> 02:07:53,750
networks yeah how do you make sense of
that that destroyed the field for he

7220
02:07:53,750 --> 02:07:53,760
that that destroyed the field for he
 

7221
02:07:53,760 --> 02:07:56,149
that that destroyed the field for he
probably do you think he knew that the

7222
02:07:56,149 --> 02:07:56,159
probably do you think he knew that the
 

7223
02:07:56,159 --> 02:08:00,550
probably do you think he knew that the
effect that book would have

7224
02:08:00,550 --> 02:08:00,560

 

7225
02:08:00,560 --> 02:08:03,430

all the theorems and negative theorems

7226
02:08:03,430 --> 02:08:03,440
all the theorems and negative theorems
 

7227
02:08:03,440 --> 02:08:04,390
all the theorems and negative theorems
yeah

7228
02:08:04,390 --> 02:08:04,400
yeah
 

7229
02:08:04,400 --> 02:08:05,830
yeah
um yeah

7230
02:08:05,830 --> 02:08:05,840
um yeah
 

7231
02:08:05,840 --> 02:08:06,709
um yeah
so

7232
02:08:06,709 --> 02:08:06,719
so
 

7233
02:08:06,719 --> 02:08:09,830
so
yeah that's just the way of

7234
02:08:09,830 --> 02:08:09,840
yeah that's just the way of
 

7235
02:08:09,840 --> 02:08:11,990
yeah that's just the way of
that's the way of life

7236
02:08:11,990 --> 02:08:12,000
that's the way of life
 

7237
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,069
that's the way of life
yeah but still it's kind of tragic that

7238
02:08:14,069 --> 02:08:14,079
yeah but still it's kind of tragic that
 

7239
02:08:14,079 --> 02:08:15,910
yeah but still it's kind of tragic that
he was both the proponent and the

7240
02:08:15,910 --> 02:08:15,920
he was both the proponent and the
 

7241
02:08:15,920 --> 02:08:18,709
he was both the proponent and the
destroyer of neural networks yeah

7242
02:08:18,709 --> 02:08:18,719
destroyer of neural networks yeah
 

7243
02:08:18,719 --> 02:08:21,350
destroyer of neural networks yeah
um is there other memory standouts

7244
02:08:21,350 --> 02:08:21,360
um is there other memory standouts
 

7245
02:08:21,360 --> 02:08:22,790
um is there other memory standouts
from the

7246
02:08:22,790 --> 02:08:22,800
from the
 

7247
02:08:22,800 --> 02:08:28,069
from the
the robotics and the ai work at mit

7248
02:08:28,069 --> 02:08:28,079

 

7249
02:08:28,079 --> 02:08:28,870

well
 

7251
02:08:28,880 --> 02:08:31,350
well
yeah but you gotta be more specific

place i mean to me it's a little bit

7256
02:08:34,470 --> 02:08:34,480
place i mean to me it's a little bit
 

7257
02:08:34,480 --> 02:08:36,790
place i mean to me it's a little bit
also heartbreaking

7258
02:08:36,790 --> 02:08:36,800
also heartbreaking

that
 

7261
02:08:38,639 --> 02:08:40,709
that
you know with google and facebook like

7262
02:08:40,709 --> 02:08:40,719
you know with google and facebook like
 

7263
02:08:40,719 --> 02:08:44,709
you know with google and facebook like
deepmind and so on so much of the talent

7264
02:08:44,709 --> 02:08:44,719
deepmind and so on so much of the talent
 

7265
02:08:44,719 --> 02:08:46,790
deepmind and so on so much of the talent
you know doesn't stay necessarily for

7266
02:08:46,790 --> 02:08:46,800
you know doesn't stay necessarily for
 

7267
02:08:46,800 --> 02:08:49,030
you know doesn't stay necessarily for
prolonged periods of time in these

7268
02:08:49,030 --> 02:08:49,040
prolonged periods of time in these
 

7269
02:08:49,040 --> 02:08:52,069
prolonged periods of time in these
in these universities oh yeah i mean

7270
02:08:52,069 --> 02:08:52,079
in these universities oh yeah i mean
 

7271
02:08:52,079 --> 02:08:53,510
in these universities oh yeah i mean
some of the companies are more guilty

7272
02:08:53,510 --> 02:08:53,520
some of the companies are more guilty
 

7273
02:08:53,520 --> 02:08:56,470
some of the companies are more guilty
than others are paying

7274
02:08:56,470 --> 02:08:56,480

7318
02:09:45,990 --> 02:09:46,000
google buying those 809 robotics company
 

7319
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,149
google buying those 809 robotics company
was bad for the field because it locked

7320
02:09:48,149 --> 02:09:48,159
was bad for the field because it locked
 

7321
02:09:48,159 --> 02:09:50,229
was bad for the field because it locked
those people away

7322

those people away
 

7323
02:09:50,239 --> 02:09:51,510
those people away
they didn't have to make the company

7324
02:09:51,510 --> 02:09:51,520
they didn't have to make the company
 

7325
02:09:51,520 --> 02:09:54,229
they didn't have to make the company
succeed anymore locked them away for

7326
02:09:54,229 --> 02:09:54,239
succeed anymore locked them away for
 

7327
02:09:54,239 --> 02:09:57,350
succeed anymore locked them away for
years and then

7328
02:09:57,350 --> 02:09:57,360

 

7329
02:09:57,360 --> 02:10:00,550

sort of all threaded away yeah

did you ever get a chance to such a
 

7607
02:15:01,679 --> 02:15:03,350
did you ever get a chance to such a
different world than yours

7608
02:15:03,350 --> 02:15:03,360
different world than yours
 

7609
02:15:03,360 --> 02:15:05,510

of uh computer science and mathematics
and you're so much about the magic of

7616
02:15:11,830 --> 02:15:11,840
and you're so much about the magic of
 

7617
02:15:11,840 --> 02:15:13,830
and you're so much about the magic of
robotics like the practice of it did you

7618
02:15:13,830 --> 02:15:13,840
robotics like the practice of it did you
 

7619
02:15:13,840 --> 02:15:15,669
robotics like the practice of it did you
mention him earlier for like

7620

mention him earlier for like
 

7621
02:15:15,679 --> 02:15:18,550
mention him earlier for like
not you know about computation did your

7622
02:15:18,550 --> 02:15:18,560
not you know about computation did your
 

7623
02:15:18,560 --> 02:15:21,030
not you know about computation did your
worlds cross they did enough you know i

7624
02:15:21,030 --> 02:15:21,040
worlds cross they did enough you know i
 

7625
02:15:21,040 --> 02:15:23,270

so um
 

7633
02:15:28,079 --> 02:15:29,990
so um
you know besides you know analysis of

7634
02:15:29,990 --> 02:15:30,000
you know besides you know analysis of
 

7635
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,149
you know besides you know analysis of
algorithms he's well known for

7636
02:15:32,149 --> 02:15:32,159
algorithms he's well known for
 

7637
02:15:32,159 --> 02:15:34,310

so he did that at the ai lab

7642
02:15:40,790 --> 02:15:40,800
so he did that at the ai lab
 

7643
02:15:40,800 --> 02:15:42,390
so he did that at the ai lab
and he would do it he would work

7644

one night the uh
the mainframe computer went down

7654
02:15:53,189 --> 02:15:53,199
the mainframe computer went down
 

7655
02:15:53,199 --> 02:15:55,189
the mainframe computer went down
and um

7656
02:15:55,189 --> 02:15:55,199
and um
 

7657
02:15:55,199 --> 02:15:57,510
and um
a guy named robert paul was there he

7658
02:15:57,510 --> 02:15:57,520
a guy named robert paul was there he
 

7659
02:15:57,520 --> 02:16:00,550
a guy named robert paul was there he
only did his phd at the media lab at mit

7660
02:16:00,550 --> 02:16:00,560
only did his phd at the media lab at mit
 

7661
02:16:00,560 --> 02:16:02,629
only did his phd at the media lab at mit
and he was a you know

7662
02:16:02,629 --> 02:16:02,639
and he was a you know
 

7663
02:16:02,639 --> 02:16:05,430
and he was a you know
engineer uh and so

7664
02:16:05,430 --> 02:16:05,440
engineer uh and so
 

7665
02:16:05,440 --> 02:16:07,830
engineer uh and so
i and he and i you know tracked down

7666
02:16:07,830 --> 02:16:07,840
i and he and i you know tracked down
 

7667
02:16:07,840 --> 02:16:09,189
i and he and i you know tracked down
what were the problem was it was one of

7668
02:16:09,189 --> 02:16:09,199
what were the problem was it was one of
 

7669
02:16:09,199 --> 02:16:11,510
what were the problem was it was one of
those big refrigerator size or washing

7670
02:16:11,510 --> 02:16:11,520
those big refrigerator size or washing
 

7671
02:16:11,520 --> 02:16:13,589
those big refrigerator size or washing
machine size disk drives unveiled and

7672
02:16:13,589 --> 02:16:13,599
machine size disk drives unveiled and
 

7673
02:16:13,599 --> 02:16:14,790
machine size disk drives unveiled and
that's what brought the whole system

7674
02:16:14,790 --> 02:16:14,800
that's what brought the whole system
 

7675
02:16:14,800 --> 02:16:17,510
that's what brought the whole system
down so we got panels pulled off and

7676
02:16:17,510 --> 02:16:17,520
down so we got panels pulled off and
 

7677
02:16:17,520 --> 02:16:20,310
down so we got panels pulled off and
we're pulling you know circuit cards out

7678
02:16:20,310 --> 02:16:20,320
we're pulling you know circuit cards out
 

7679
02:16:20,320 --> 02:16:23,189
we're pulling you know circuit cards out
and donald knuth who's a really tall guy

7680
02:16:23,189 --> 02:16:23,199
and donald knuth who's a really tall guy
 

7681
02:16:23,199 --> 02:16:25,030
and donald knuth who's a really tall guy
he walks in and he's looking down and

7682
02:16:25,030 --> 02:16:25,040
he walks in and he's looking down and
 

7683
02:16:25,040 --> 02:16:26,950
he walks in and he's looking down and
says when will it be fixed you know does

7684
02:16:26,950 --> 02:16:26,960
says when will it be fixed you know does
 

7685
02:16:26,960 --> 02:16:28,629
says when will it be fixed you know does
he want to get back to write his tax

7686
02:16:28,629 --> 02:16:28,639
he want to get back to write his tax
 

7687
02:16:28,639 --> 02:16:32,469
he want to get back to write his tax
system

7688
02:16:32,469 --> 02:16:32,479

 

7689
02:16:32,479 --> 02:16:34,870

we figured out you know it was a

7690
02:16:34,870 --> 02:16:34,880
we figured out you know it was a
 

7691
02:16:34,880 --> 02:16:37,669
we figured out you know it was a
particular chip 7400 series chip which

7692
02:16:37,669 --> 02:16:37,679
particular chip 7400 series chip which
 

7693
02:16:37,679 --> 02:16:40,070
particular chip 7400 series chip which
was socketed we popped

7694
02:16:40,070 --> 02:16:40,080
was socketed we popped
 

7695
02:16:40,080 --> 02:16:42,549
was socketed we popped
it out we put a replacement in put it

7696
02:16:42,549 --> 02:16:42,559
it out we put a replacement in put it
 

7697
02:16:42,559 --> 02:16:44,950
it out we put a replacement in put it
back in smoke comes out because we put

7698
02:16:44,950 --> 02:16:44,960
back in smoke comes out because we put
 

7699
02:16:44,960 --> 02:16:46,790
back in smoke comes out because we put
it in backwards because we're so nervous

7700
02:16:46,790 --> 02:16:46,800
it in backwards because we're so nervous
 

7701
02:16:46,800 --> 02:16:49,589
it in backwards because we're so nervous
that donald knuth was standing over us

7702
02:16:49,589 --> 02:16:49,599
that donald knuth was standing over us
 

7703
02:16:49,599 --> 02:16:51,349
that donald knuth was standing over us
anyway we eventually got it fixed and

7704
02:16:51,349 --> 02:16:51,359
anyway we eventually got it fixed and
 

7705
02:16:51,359 --> 02:16:53,669
anyway we eventually got it fixed and
got the mainframe running again

7706
02:16:53,669 --> 02:16:53,679
got the mainframe running again
 

7707
02:16:53,679 --> 02:16:55,509
got the mainframe running again
so that was your little when was that

7708
02:16:55,509 --> 02:16:55,519
so that was your little when was that
 

7709
02:16:55,519 --> 02:16:57,669
so that was your little when was that
again that well that must be before

7710
02:16:57,669 --> 02:16:57,679
again that well that must be before
 

7711
02:16:57,679 --> 02:16:59,750
again that well that must be before
october 79 because we moved out of that

7712
02:16:59,750 --> 02:16:59,760
october 79 because we moved out of that
 

7713
02:16:59,760 --> 02:17:02,230
october 79 because we moved out of that
building then so sometimes probably 78

7714
02:17:02,230 --> 02:17:02,240
building then so sometimes probably 78
 

7715
02:17:02,240 --> 02:17:05,589
building then so sometimes probably 78
sometime or early 79.

7716
02:17:05,589 --> 02:17:05,599
sometime or early 79.
 

7717

produce papers

7762
02:17:55,270 --> 02:17:55,280

 

7763
02:17:55,280 --> 02:17:57,429

um that would be acceptable and be

7764
02:17:57,429 --> 02:17:57,439
um that would be acceptable and be
 

7765
02:17:57,439 --> 02:18:00,150
um that would be acceptable and be
published

7766
02:18:00,150 --> 02:18:00,160

 

7767
02:18:00,160 --> 02:18:02,629

uh maybe i was maybe i come from an age

7768
02:18:02,629 --> 02:18:02,639
uh maybe i was maybe i come from an age
 

7769
02:18:02,639 --> 02:18:05,030
uh maybe i was maybe i come from an age
where i would i could be a rebel against

7770
02:18:05,030 --> 02:18:05,040
where i would i could be a rebel against
 

7771
02:18:05,040 --> 02:18:07,589
where i would i could be a rebel against
that and and still succeed maybe it's

7772
02:18:07,589 --> 02:18:07,599
that and and still succeed maybe it's
 

7773
02:18:07,599 --> 02:18:09,669
that and and still succeed maybe it's
harder today

7774
02:18:09,669 --> 02:18:09,679
harder today
 

7775
02:18:09,679 --> 02:18:12,469
harder today
but i think it's important not to get

7776
02:18:12,469 --> 02:18:12,479
but i think it's important not to get
 

7777
02:18:12,479 --> 02:18:14,870
but i think it's important not to get
too caught up

7778
02:18:14,870 --> 02:18:14,880
too caught up
 

7779
02:18:14,880 --> 02:18:15,910
too caught up
with

7780
02:18:15,910 --> 02:18:15,920
with
 

7781
02:18:15,920 --> 02:18:18,389
with
what everyone else is doing

7782
02:18:18,389 --> 02:18:18,399
what everyone else is doing
 

7783
02:18:18,399 --> 02:18:20,629
what everyone else is doing
and

7784
02:18:20,629 --> 02:18:20,639
and
 

7785
02:18:20,639 --> 02:18:22,389
and
if you if a lot depends on what you want

7786
02:18:22,389 --> 02:18:22,399
if you if a lot depends on what you want
 

7787
02:18:22,399 --> 02:18:24,870
if you if a lot depends on what you want
of life if you want to

7788
02:18:24,870 --> 02:18:24,880
of life if you want to
 

7789
02:18:24,880 --> 02:18:27,110
of life if you want to
have real impact

7790
02:18:27,110 --> 02:18:27,120
have real impact
 

7791
02:18:27,120 --> 02:18:29,669
have real impact
you have to be ready to fail

7792
02:18:29,669 --> 02:18:29,679
you have to be ready to fail
 

7793
02:18:29,679 --> 02:18:32,230
you have to be ready to fail
a lot of times so you have to make a lot

7794
02:18:32,230 --> 02:18:32,240
a lot of times so you have to make a lot
 

7795
02:18:32,240 --> 02:18:34,230
a lot of times so you have to make a lot
of unsafe decisions

7796
02:18:34,230 --> 02:18:34,240
of unsafe decisions
 

7797
02:18:34,240 --> 02:18:36,549
of unsafe decisions
and the only way to make that work is to

7798
02:18:36,549 --> 02:18:36,559
and the only way to make that work is to
 

7799
02:18:36,559 --> 02:18:38,790
and the only way to make that work is to
make keep doing it for a long time and

7800
02:18:38,790 --> 02:18:38,800
make keep doing it for a long time and
 

7801
02:18:38,800 --> 02:18:41,030
make keep doing it for a long time and
then one of them will be work out and so

7802
02:18:41,030 --> 02:18:41,040
then one of them will be work out and so
 

7803
02:18:41,040 --> 02:18:42,870
then one of them will be work out and so
that that that will make something

7804
02:18:42,870 --> 02:18:42,880
that that that will make something
 

7805
02:18:42,880 --> 02:18:46,070
that that that will make something
successful or not

7806
02:18:46,070 --> 02:18:46,080
successful or not
 

7807
02:18:46,080 --> 02:18:48,070
successful or not
or you may or you just may you know end

possible taking the risk is the thing

7814
02:18:53,429 --> 02:18:53,439

what i hope is that i actually
 

7899
02:20:37,040 --> 02:20:39,590
what i hope is that i actually
finished writing this book

7900
02:20:39,590 --> 02:20:39,600
finished writing this book
 

7901
02:20:39,600 --> 02:20:41,270
finished writing this book
and that

7902
02:20:41,270 --> 02:20:41,280
and that
 

7903
02:20:41,280 --> 02:20:43,750
and that
there was a there's one person

7904
02:20:43,750 --> 02:20:43,760
there was a there's one person
 

7905
02:20:43,760 --> 02:20:45,670
there was a there's one person
who reads it

7906
02:20:45,670 --> 02:20:45,680
who reads it
 

7907
02:20:45,680 --> 02:20:47,590
who reads it
and sees something

7908
02:20:47,590 --> 02:20:47,600
and sees something
 

7909
02:20:47,600 --> 02:20:50,150
and sees something
about changing the way they're thinking

7910
02:20:50,150 --> 02:20:50,160
about changing the way they're thinking
 

7911
02:20:50,160 --> 02:20:52,150
about changing the way they're thinking
and that leads to

7912
02:20:52,150 --> 02:20:52,160
and that leads to
 

7913
02:20:52,160 --> 02:20:54,070
and that leads to
the next

7914
02:20:54,070 --> 02:20:54,080
the next
 

7915
02:20:54,080 --> 02:20:56,150
the next
big

7916
02:20:56,150 --> 02:20:56,160
big
 

7917
02:20:56,160 --> 02:20:57,429
big
and then there'll be

7918
02:20:57,429 --> 02:20:57,439
and then there'll be
 

7919
02:20:57,439 --> 02:20:59,190
and then there'll be
on a podcast a hundred years from now

this whole thing the existence the the
the all the hurried things we do on this

7932
02:21:13,190 --> 02:21:13,200
the all the hurried things we do on this
 

7933

planet
what do you think is the meaning of it

7936
02:21:15,270 --> 02:21:15,280
what do you think is the meaning of it
 

7937
02:21:15,280 --> 02:21:17,110
what do you think is the meaning of it
all yeah well you know i think we're all

7938
02:21:17,110 --> 02:21:17,120
all yeah well you know i think we're all
 

7939
02:21:17,120 --> 02:21:19,670
all yeah well you know i think we're all
really bad at it

7940
02:21:19,670 --> 02:21:19,680
really bad at it
 

7941
02:21:19,680 --> 02:21:21,830
really bad at it
life or finding meaning or both yeah we

7942
02:21:21,830 --> 02:21:21,840
life or finding meaning or both yeah we
 

7943
02:21:21,840 --> 02:21:24,389
life or finding meaning or both yeah we
get caught up in in in the it's easier

7944
02:21:24,389 --> 02:21:24,399
get caught up in in in the it's easier

to get easier to do the stuff that's
immediate and not through the stuff it's

7948
02:21:28,550 --> 02:21:28,560
immediate and not through the stuff it's
 

7949

not immediate
 

7951
02:21:29,840 --> 02:21:32,870
not immediate
um so the big picture we're batting yeah

7952
02:21:32,870 --> 02:21:32,880
um so the big picture we're batting yeah
 

7953
02:21:32,880 --> 02:21:35,349
um so the big picture we're batting yeah
yeah do you have a sense of what that

7954
02:21:35,349 --> 02:21:35,359
yeah do you have a sense of what that
 

7955
02:21:35,359 --> 02:21:37,429
yeah do you have a sense of what that
big picture is like why you ever look up

7956
02:21:37,429 --> 02:21:37,439
big picture is like why you ever look up
 

7957
02:21:37,439 --> 02:21:39,830
big picture is like why you ever look up
to the stars and ask why the hell are we

7958
02:21:39,830 --> 02:21:39,840
to the stars and ask why the hell are we
 

7959
02:21:39,840 --> 02:21:43,750
to the stars and ask why the hell are we
here

7960
02:21:43,750 --> 02:21:43,760

 

7961
02:21:43,760 --> 02:21:45,830

you know my my

7962
02:21:45,830 --> 02:21:45,840
you know my my
 

7963
02:21:45,840 --> 02:21:50,070
you know my my
my my atheism tells me it's just random

7964
02:21:50,070 --> 02:21:50,080
my my atheism tells me it's just random
 

7965
02:21:50,080 --> 02:21:52,630
my my atheism tells me it's just random
but you know i want to understand the

7966
02:21:52,630 --> 02:21:52,640
but you know i want to understand the
 

7967
02:21:52,640 --> 02:21:55,349
but you know i want to understand the
way random in the and that's what i talk

7968
02:21:55,349 --> 02:21:55,359
way random in the and that's what i talk
 

7969
02:21:55,359 --> 02:21:57,110
way random in the and that's what i talk
about in this book how order comes from

7970
02:21:57,110 --> 02:21:57,120
about in this book how order comes from
 

7971
02:21:57,120 --> 02:21:58,660
about in this book how order comes from
disorder yeah um

7972
02:21:58,660 --> 02:21:58,670
disorder yeah um
 

7973
02:21:58,670 --> 02:22:00,150
disorder yeah um
[Music]

7974
02:22:00,150 --> 02:22:00,160
[Music]
 

7975
02:22:00,160 --> 02:22:02,309
[Music]
but it kind of sprung up like most of

7976
02:22:02,309 --> 02:22:02,319
but it kind of sprung up like most of
 

7977
02:22:02,319 --> 02:22:03,830
but it kind of sprung up like most of
the whole thing is random but this

7978
02:22:03,830 --> 02:22:03,840
the whole thing is random but this
 

7979
02:22:03,840 --> 02:22:04,870
the whole thing is random but this
little

7980
02:22:04,870 --> 02:22:04,880
little
 

7981
02:22:04,880 --> 02:22:06,550
little
pocket of complexity they would call

7982
02:22:06,550 --> 02:22:06,560
pocket of complexity they would call
 

7983
02:22:06,560 --> 02:22:07,590
pocket of complexity they would call
earth

7984
02:22:07,590 --> 02:22:07,600
earth
 

7985
02:22:07,600 --> 02:22:10,230
earth
that like why the hell does that happen

7986
02:22:10,230 --> 02:22:10,240
that like why the hell does that happen
 

7987
02:22:10,240 --> 02:22:12,150
that like why the hell does that happen
and and what we don't know

7988
02:22:12,150 --> 02:22:12,160
and and what we don't know
 

7989
02:22:12,160 --> 02:22:13,910
and and what we don't know
is how common that

7990
02:22:13,910 --> 02:22:13,920
is how common that
 

7991
02:22:13,920 --> 02:22:16,790
is how common that
pop those pockets of complexity are or

7992
02:22:16,790 --> 02:22:16,800
pop those pockets of complexity are or
 

7993
02:22:16,800 --> 02:22:17,990
pop those pockets of complexity are or
how often

7994
02:22:17,990 --> 02:22:18,000
how often
 

7995
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:20,830
how often
um because they may not last

7996
02:22:20,830 --> 02:22:20,840
um because they may not last
 

7997
02:22:20,840 --> 02:22:22,790
um because they may not last
forever

7998
02:22:22,790 --> 02:22:22,800
forever
 

7999
02:22:22,800 --> 02:22:25,429
forever
which is uh more exciting slash sad to

infinite number of oh i i i think i
 

8005
02:22:31,920 --> 02:22:34,389
infinite number of oh i i i think i
think it's impossible for me to believe

8006
02:22:34,389 --> 02:22:34,399
think it's impossible for me to believe

it could be like the sad thing it could
be like a graveyard of intelligent

8016
02:22:45,349 --> 02:22:45,359
be like a graveyard of intelligent
 

8017
02:22:45,359 --> 02:22:48,150
be like a graveyard of intelligent
civilizations oh everywhere yeah that

8018
02:22:48,150 --> 02:22:48,160
civilizations oh everywhere yeah that
 

8019
02:22:48,160 --> 02:22:50,630
civilizations oh everywhere yeah that
might be the most likely outcome

8020
02:22:50,630 --> 02:22:50,640
might be the most likely outcome
 

8021
02:22:50,640 --> 02:22:53,190
might be the most likely outcome
and for us too yeah exactly yeah and all

8022

of this will be forgotten yeah
 

8025
02:22:55,680 --> 02:22:58,389
of this will be forgotten yeah
including all the robots you build

8026
02:22:58,389 --> 02:22:58,399
including all the robots you build
 

8027
02:22:58,399 --> 02:23:01,510
including all the robots you build
everything forgotten

8028
02:23:01,510 --> 02:23:01,520
everything forgotten
 

8029
02:23:01,520 --> 02:23:03,670
everything forgotten
well on average

8030
02:23:03,670 --> 02:23:03,680
well on average
 

8031
02:23:03,680 --> 02:23:05,750
well on average
everyone has been forgotten in history

8032
02:23:05,750 --> 02:23:05,760
everyone has been forgotten in history
 

8033
02:23:05,760 --> 02:23:06,950
everyone has been forgotten in history
yeah right

8034

yeah right
 

8035
02:23:06,960 --> 02:23:08,950
yeah right
yeah most people are not remembered

8036
02:23:08,950 --> 02:23:08,960
yeah most people are not remembered
 

8037
02:23:08,960 --> 02:23:11,110
yeah most people are not remembered
beyond a generation or two

8038
02:23:11,110 --> 02:23:11,120
beyond a generation or two
 

8039
02:23:11,120 --> 02:23:12,070
beyond a generation or two
um

8040
02:23:12,070 --> 02:23:12,080

basically
very close to 100 percent of people

8046
02:23:16,950 --> 02:23:16,960
very close to 100 percent of people
 

8047
02:23:16,960 --> 02:23:19,030
very close to 100 percent of people
who've ever lived or forgotten yeah i

8048
02:23:19,030 --> 02:23:19,040
who've ever lived or forgotten yeah i
 

8049
02:23:19,040 --> 02:23:19,750

no longer i don't know anyone alive who
 

8053
02:23:22,319 --> 02:23:24,230
no longer i don't know anyone alive who
remembers my great grandparents because

8054
02:23:24,230 --> 02:23:24,240
remembers my great grandparents because
 

8055
02:23:24,240 --> 02:23:26,230

most fun things is
robots and i've looked up to your work

8076
02:23:45,110 --> 02:23:45,120
robots and i've looked up to your work
 

8077
