00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,710
i would say they'd give us like a
a d minus on economics

174
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:04,720
a d minus on economics
 

175
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,509
a d minus on economics
like

176
00:03:05,509 --> 00:03:05,519
like
 

177
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,390
like
you know an f plus or a d minus you you

178
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:08,400
you know an f plus or a d minus you you
 

179
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,990
you know an f plus or a d minus you you
have an optimistic vision first of all

180
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:10,000
have an optimistic vision first of all
 

181
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,990
have an optimistic vision first of all
optimistic vision of engineering

182
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:12,000
optimistic vision of engineering
 

183
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,309

because everybody you've listed

184
00:03:14,309 --> 00:03:14,319
because everybody you've listed
 

185
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,390
because everybody you've listed
not everybody most people you've listed

00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:16,400
not everybody most people you've listed
 

187
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,070
not everybody most people you've listed
is just over the past couple of

188
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:18,080
is just over the past couple of
 

189
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,110
is just over the past couple of
centuries

190
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:19,120
centuries
 

191
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,790
centuries
and maybe it stretches a little farther

192
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:20,800
and maybe it stretches a little farther
 

193
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,390
and maybe it stretches a little farther
back but mostly

194
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:22,400
back but mostly
 

195
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,670
back but mostly
all the cool stuff we've done in

196
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:23,680
all the cool stuff we've done in
 

197
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,149
all the cool stuff we've done in
engineering is the past couple centuries

i mean archimedes

200
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:28,319
i mean archimedes
 

201
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,270
i mean archimedes
you know had his virtues

202
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:31,280
you know had his virtues
 

203
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,630
you know had his virtues
you know i studied the history of

204
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:32,640
you know i studied the history of
 

205
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,390
you know i studied the history of
science at mit and i also studied

206
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:34,400
science at mit and i also studied
 

207
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,949
science at mit and i also studied
aerospace engineering and and so i

208
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:36,959
aerospace engineering and and so i
 

209
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,670
aerospace engineering and and so i
clearly have a bias in favor of science

210
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:39,680
clearly have a bias in favor of science
 

211
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,309
clearly have a bias in favor of science
and if i look at the past 10 000 years

212
00:03:42,309 --> 00:03:42,319
and if i look at the past 10 000 years
 

213
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,589
and if i look at the past 10 000 years
and i consider

214
00:03:43,589 --> 00:03:43,599
and i consider
 

215
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,949
and i consider
all of the philosophy and the politics

216
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:46,959
all of the philosophy and the politics
 

217
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,670
all of the philosophy and the politics
and their impact on the human condition

218
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:49,680
and their impact on the human condition
 

219
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,750
and their impact on the human condition
i think it's a wash for every politician

220
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:51,760
i think it's a wash for every politician
 

221
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,670
i think it's a wash for every politician
that came up with a good idea another

227
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,550
right and it's not clear to me that you
know most of the political and

understand the science of
 

337
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,029
understand the science of
of infectious disease they're you know

338
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:11,039
of infectious disease they're you know
 

339
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,029
of infectious disease they're you know
sterilizing

340
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:13,039
sterilizing
 

341
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,230
sterilizing
a knife

342
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:14,240
a knife
 

343
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,309
a knife
and harnessing antibiotics gets you from

344
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:16,319
and harnessing antibiotics gets you from
 

345
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,710
and harnessing antibiotics gets you from
50 to 70 and that happened fast right

346
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:18,720
50 to 70 and that happened fast right
 

347
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,230
50 to 70 and that happened fast right
that happens from 1900 to 1950 or

348
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:22,240
that happens from 1900 to 1950 or
 

349
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,309
that happens from 1900 to 1950 or
something like that

350
00:06:24,309 --> 00:06:24,319
something like that
 

351
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,469
something like that
and i i think if you look

352
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:26,479
and i i think if you look
 

353
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,950
and i i think if you look
look at the human condition

354
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:28,960
look at the human condition
 

355
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,870
look at the human condition
you ever get on one of those rowing

356
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:30,880
you ever get on one of those rowing
 

357
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,550
you ever get on one of those rowing
machines where they actually keep track

358
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:32,560
machines where they actually keep track
 

359
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,870
machines where they actually keep track
of your watts output when you're on that

360
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:34,880
of your watts output when you're on that
 

361
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,469
of your watts output when you're on that
yeah you know it's like 200 is a lot

362
00:06:38,469 --> 00:06:38,479
yeah you know it's like 200 is a lot
 

363
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,309
yeah you know it's like 200 is a lot
okay 200

364
00:06:40,309 --> 00:06:40,319
okay 200
 

365
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,270
okay 200
is a lot so a kilowatt hour

366
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:43,280
is a lot so a kilowatt hour
 

367
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,749
is a lot so a kilowatt hour
is like all the energy that a human a

368
00:06:45,749 --> 00:06:45,759
is like all the energy that a human a
 

369
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,550
is like all the energy that a human a
trained athlete can deliver in

370
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:48,560
trained athlete can deliver in
 

371
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,070
trained athlete can deliver in
a day

372
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:50,080
a day
 

373
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,309
a day
and probably not one percent of the

374
00:06:52,309 --> 00:06:52,319
and probably not one percent of the
 

375
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,390
and probably not one percent of the
people in the in the world could deliver

376
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:54,400
people in the in the world could deliver
 

377
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,309
people in the in the world could deliver
a kilowatt hour in a day and the

378
00:06:56,309 --> 00:06:56,319
a kilowatt hour in a day and the
 

379
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,029
a kilowatt hour in a day and the
commercial value of a kilowatt hour the

380
00:06:59,029 --> 00:06:59,039
commercial value of a kilowatt hour the
 

381
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,710
commercial value of a kilowatt hour the
retail value is 11 cents today and uh

382
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:02,720
retail value is 11 cents today and uh
 

383
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,510
retail value is 11 cents today and uh
the wholesale value is two cents

384
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:05,520
the wholesale value is two cents
 

385
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,550
the wholesale value is two cents
and

386
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:06,560
and
 

387
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,990
and
so you have to look at the contribution

388
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:10,000
so you have to look at the contribution
 

389
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,550
so you have to look at the contribution
of politicians and philosophers and

390
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:12,560
of politicians and philosophers and
 

391
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,189
of politicians and philosophers and
economists to the human condition

392
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:15,199
economists to the human condition
 

393
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,830
economists to the human condition
and and it's it's like at best to wash

394
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:17,840
and and it's it's like at best to wash
 

395
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,350
and and it's it's like at best to wash
one way or the other and then if you

396
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:19,360
one way or the other and then if you
 

397
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,110
one way or the other and then if you
look at the contribution of john d

398
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:21,120
look at the contribution of john d
 

399
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,790
look at the contribution of john d
rockefeller

400
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:22,800
rockefeller
 

401
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,270
rockefeller
when he delivered you a barrel of oil

402
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:25,280
when he delivered you a barrel of oil
 

403
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,070
when he delivered you a barrel of oil
yeah and then you know the energy and in

404
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,080
yeah and then you know the energy and in
 

405
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,629
yeah and then you know the energy and in
oil liquid energy or the contribution of

406
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:30,639
oil liquid energy or the contribution of
 

407
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,309

you know
and what's the impact of the human

414
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:37,759
and what's the impact of the human
 

415

dynamics is n dimensional

502
00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:13,519
dynamics is n dimensional
 

503
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,230
dynamics is n dimensional
higher level math you know complicated

504
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:16,240
higher level math you know complicated
 

505
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,269
higher level math you know complicated
stuff

506
00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:17,279
stuff
 

507
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,430
stuff
so when when an economist says the

508
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:19,440
so when when an economist says the
 

509
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,350
so when when an economist says the
inflation rate is two percent that's a

510
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:21,360
inflation rate is two percent that's a
 

511
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,870
inflation rate is two percent that's a
scalar and when an economist says

512
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:24,880
scalar and when an economist says
 

513
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,269
scalar and when an economist says
it's not a problem to print more money

514
00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:27,279
it's not a problem to print more money
 

515
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,030
it's not a problem to print more money
because the velocity of the money is

516
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:29,040
because the velocity of the money is
 

517
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,910
because the velocity of the money is
very low the monetary velocity is low

518
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:31,920
very low the monetary velocity is low
 

519
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,990
very low the monetary velocity is low
that's another scalar

520
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:34,000
that's another scalar
 

521
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,430
that's another scalar
okay so

522
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:35,440
okay so
 

523
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,150
okay so
the truth of the matter is

524
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:38,160
the truth of the matter is
 

525
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,630
the truth of the matter is
inflation is not a scalar inflation is

526
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:40,640
inflation is not a scalar inflation is
 

527
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,030
inflation is not a scalar inflation is
an in-dimensional vector

528
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:43,040
an in-dimensional vector
 

529
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,590
an in-dimensional vector
money velocity is not a scalar

530
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:45,600
money velocity is not a scalar
 

531
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,630
money velocity is not a scalar
um

532
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:46,640
um
 

533
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,870
um
develo saying what's the velocity of

534
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:48,880
develo saying what's the velocity of
 

535
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,630
develo saying what's the velocity of
money oh oh it's slow or it's fast

536
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:52,640
money oh oh it's slow or it's fast
 

537
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,350
money oh oh it's slow or it's fast
it ignores the question of

538
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:55,360
it ignores the question of
 

539
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,990
it ignores the question of
what medium is the money moving through

540
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:58,000
what medium is the money moving through
 

541
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,310
what medium is the money moving through
in the same way that you know

542
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:00,320
in the same way that you know
 

543
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,630
in the same way that you know
what's the speed of sound

544
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:02,640
what's the speed of sound
 

545
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,030
what's the speed of sound
okay well what is sound right

546
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:05,040
okay well what is sound right
 

547
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,910
okay well what is sound right
sound you know sound is uh is a

548
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:07,920
sound you know sound is uh is a
 

549
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,430
sound you know sound is uh is a
compression wave it's energy uh moving

550
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:11,440
compression wave it's energy uh moving
 

551
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,110
compression wave it's energy uh moving
through a medium but the speed is

552
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:13,120
through a medium but the speed is
 

553
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:13,990
through a medium but the speed is
different

554
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:14,000
different
 

555
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,750
different
so for example the speed of sound

556
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:15,760
so for example the speed of sound
 

557
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,350
so for example the speed of sound
through air is different than the speed

558
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:17,360
through air is different than the speed
 

559
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,030
through air is different than the speed
of sound through water

560
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:19,040
of sound through water
 

561
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,030
of sound through water
and and a sound moves faster through

562
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:21,040
and and a sound moves faster through
 

563
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,630
and and a sound moves faster through
water it moves faster through a solid

564
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:22,640
water it moves faster through a solid
 

565
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,350
water it moves faster through a solid
and it moves faster to a stiffer solid

566
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:25,360
and it moves faster to a stiffer solid
 

567
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,269
and it moves faster to a stiffer solid
so there isn't one

568
00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:27,279
so there isn't one
 

569
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,949
so there isn't one
what is the fundamental problem with the

570
00:10:28,949 --> 00:10:28,959
what is the fundamental problem with the
 

571
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,430
what is the fundamental problem with the
way economists reduce the world down to

572
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:31,440
way economists reduce the world down to
 

573
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,750
way economists reduce the world down to
a model is it too simple

574
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:33,760
a model is it too simple
 

575
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,750
a model is it too simple
or is it just even the first principles

576
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:35,760
or is it just even the first principles
 

577
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,990
or is it just even the first principles
of constructing the model is wrong i

578
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:38,000
of constructing the model is wrong i
 

579
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,829
of constructing the model is wrong i
think that uh the fundamental problem is

580
00:10:41,829 --> 00:10:41,839
think that uh the fundamental problem is
 

581
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,990
think that uh the fundamental problem is
if you see the world as a scalar you

582
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:44,000
if you see the world as a scalar you
 

583
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,430
if you see the world as a scalar you
simply pick

584
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:45,440
simply pick
 

585
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,990
simply pick
the one number which is

586
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:48,000
the one number which is
 

587
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,470
the one number which is
which supports whatever you want to do

588
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:50,480
which supports whatever you want to do
 

589
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,910
which supports whatever you want to do
and you ignore

590
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:51,920
and you ignore
 

591
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,550
and you ignore
the universe of other

592
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:54,560
the universe of other
 

593
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,110

627
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,630

yeah i i think that if we're going to

628
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:32,640
yeah i i think that if we're going to
 

629
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,470
yeah i i think that if we're going to
want to really make any scientific

progress in economics we have to apply
 

633
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,310
progress in economics we have to apply
much

634
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:38,320
much
 

635
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,790
much
much more computationally intensive and

636
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:40,800
much more computationally intensive and
 

637

who who
was an extraordinary computer scientist

654
00:11:59,269 --> 00:11:59,279
was an extraordinary computer scientist
 

655
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,629
was an extraordinary computer scientist
and

multi-dimensional non-linear models so
 

665
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,710
multi-dimensional non-linear models so
if you want to describe how

if you want to describe how
 

667
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,110
if you want to describe how
anything works in the real world you

668
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:13,120

and if you look at all the historic

730
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:16,160
and if you look at all the historic

00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,190
and if you look at all the historic
studies

of the impact of inflation

of the impact of inflation
 

735
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,949
of the impact of inflation
generally they're all based upon

736
00:13:22,949 --> 00:13:22,959
generally they're all based upon
 

737
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,150
generally they're all based upon
the idea that inflation equals cpi and

738
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:26,160
the idea that inflation equals cpi and
 

739
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,310
the idea that inflation equals cpi and
then they try to extrapolate from that

740
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:28,320
then they try to extrapolate from that
 

741
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,150
then they try to extrapolate from that
and you just get nowhere with it

and you just get nowhere with it
so

744
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:33,040
so
 

745
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,230

00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:08,800
you know
 

839
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,590
you know
if we take um for example during the

840
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:11,600
if we take um for example during the
 

841
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,110
if we take um for example during the
pandemic

842
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:13,120
pandemic
 

843
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:13,829
pandemic
the

844
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:13,839
the
 

845
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,629
the
the response of the political apparatus

846
00:15:16,629 --> 00:15:16,639
the response of the political apparatus
 

847
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,990
the response of the political apparatus
was to lower interest rates to zero

848
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:20,000
was to lower interest rates to zero
 

849
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,509
was to lower interest rates to zero
and to start to

850
00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:21,519
and to start to
 

851
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,509
and to start to
start buying assets in essence printing

852
00:15:23,509 --> 00:15:23,519
start buying assets in essence printing
 

853
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:24,470
start buying assets in essence printing
money

854
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:24,480
money
 

855
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,110
money
and the defense was there's no inflation

856
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:27,120
and the defense was there's no inflation
 

857
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,629
and the defense was there's no inflation
yeah

858
00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:28,639
yeah
 

859
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,790
yeah
but of course you had one part of the

860
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:30,800
but of course you had one part of the
 

861
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,150
but of course you had one part of the
economy where it was locked down so it

862
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:34,160
economy where it was locked down so it
 

863
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,389
economy where it was locked down so it
was illegal to buy anything

864
00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:36,399
was illegal to buy anything
 

865
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,150
was illegal to buy anything
but you couldn't you know it was either

866
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:38,160
but you couldn't you know it was either
 

867
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,350
but you couldn't you know it was either
illegal or it was impractical

868
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:41,360
illegal or it was impractical
 

869
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,509
illegal or it was impractical
so it would be impossible for demand to

870
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:43,519
so it would be impossible for demand to
 

871
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:44,949
so it would be impossible for demand to
manifest so of course there is no

872
00:15:44,949 --> 00:15:44,959
manifest so of course there is no
 

873
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:45,990
manifest so of course there is no
inflation

874
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:46,000
inflation
 

875
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,749
inflation
on the other hand

876
00:15:47,749 --> 00:15:47,759
on the other hand
 

877
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,470
on the other hand
there was instantaneous immediate

878
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:50,480
there was instantaneous immediate
 

879
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,430
there was instantaneous immediate
inflation in another part of the economy

880
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:53,440
inflation in another part of the economy
 

881
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,269
inflation in another part of the economy
for example um

882
00:15:55,269 --> 00:15:55,279
for example um
 

883
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,670
for example um
you lowered the interest rates uh to

884
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:57,680
you lowered the interest rates uh to
 

885
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,069
you lowered the interest rates uh to
zero one point we saw the uh the swap

886
00:16:00,069 --> 00:16:00,079
zero one point we saw the uh the swap
 

887
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,629
zero one point we saw the uh the swap
rate on the 30-year note go to 72 basis

888
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:02,639
rate on the 30-year note go to 72 basis
 

889
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,230
rate on the 30-year note go to 72 basis
points

890
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:04,240
points
 

891
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,110
points
okay that means that the value of a long

892
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:07,120
okay that means that the value of a long
 

893
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,829
okay that means that the value of a long
dated bond immediately inflates so the

894
00:16:09,829 --> 00:16:09,839
dated bond immediately inflates so the
 

895
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,310
dated bond immediately inflates so the
bond market had hyper inflation within

896
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:12,320
bond market had hyper inflation within
 

897
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,069

00:16:16,069 --> 00:16:16,079
of these
 

901
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,710
of these
financial decisions the asset market had

we had

906
00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:21,279
we had
 

907
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,269
we had

the inflation was in the assets

918
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:33,120
the inflation was in the assets
 

919
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,030
the inflation was in the assets
like in the stocks in the bonds uh

920
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:37,040
like in the stocks in the bonds uh
 

921
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,870
like in the stocks in the bonds uh
you know if you look today you see that

922
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:38,880
you know if you look today you see that
 

923
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,910
you know if you look today you see that
a

924
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:39,920
a
 

925
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,310
a
typical house according to case-shiller

926
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:42,320

year-over-year
so

932
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:48,160
so
 

933
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,389
so
if you're a first-time home buyer the

inflation rate is 19 percent
 

937
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,870
inflation rate is 19 percent
uh the formal cpi announced a 7.9

938

941
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,790

you can pretty much

942
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:00,800
you can pretty much
 

943
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,509
you can pretty much
create any inflation rate you want by

now ten years go by and the apartment

1018
00:18:35,669 --> 00:18:35,679
now ten years go by and the apartment
 

1019
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,270
now ten years go by and the apartment
costs more

1020

i could adjust the market basket

1022
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:39,760
i could adjust the market basket
 

1023
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,510
i could adjust the market basket
by a you know they call them hedonic

1024
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:41,520
by a you know they call them hedonic
 

1025
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,750
by a you know they call them hedonic
adjustments i could decide that it used

1026
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:43,760
adjustments i could decide that it used
 

1027
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,310
adjustments i could decide that it used
to be in 1970 to a thousand square feet

1028

to be in 1970 to a thousand square feet
 

1029
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,750
to be in 1970 to a thousand square feet
but in the year 2020 you only need 700

1030
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:49,760
but in the year 2020 you only need 700
 

1031
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,190
but in the year 2020 you only need 700
square feet because we've many

1032
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:51,200
square feet because we've many

miniaturized televisions
 

1035
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,909
miniaturized televisions
and we've got more efficient electric

1036
00:18:55,909 --> 00:18:55,919
and we've got more efficient electric
 

1037
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,270
and we've got more efficient electric
appliances and because things have

1038
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:57,280
appliances and because things have
 

1039
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,789

collapsed into the iphone you just don't

1040
00:18:58,789 --> 00:18:58,799
collapsed into the iphone you just don't
 

1041
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,150
collapsed into the iphone you just don't
need as much space

1042
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:00,160
need as much space
 

1043
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,870
need as much space
so now i you know it may be that the

1044
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:02,880
so now i you know it may be that the
 

1045
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,789
so now i you know it may be that the
apartment costs 50 percent more but

1046
00:19:04,789 --> 00:19:04,799
apartment costs 50 percent more but
 

1047
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,710
apartment costs 50 percent more but
after the hedonic adjustment there is no

after the hedonic adjustment there is no
 

1049
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,270
after the hedonic adjustment there is no
inflation because i just downgraded the

now the problem with that
 

1099
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,430
now the problem with that
is is

1100
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:03,440
is is

year in risk-free income
 

1193
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:43,270
year in risk-free income
you might retire on fifty thousand

1194
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:43,280
you might retire on fifty thousand
 

1195
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,190
you might retire on fifty thousand

saving money to buy a house
but it would be characterized as a

but it would be characterized as a
 

1271
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,390
but it would be characterized as a
benefit to society by a conventional

asset values are higher because of

1278
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:13,280
asset values are higher because of
 

1279
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,110
asset values are higher because of
interest rate fluctuation and now the

1280
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:15,120
interest rate fluctuation and now the
 

1281
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,110
interest rate fluctuation and now the
economy's got more wealth

1282
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:17,120
economy's got more wealth
 

1283
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,430
economy's got more wealth
and uh and so that's that's viewed as a

1284
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:19,440
and uh and so that's that's viewed as a
 

1285
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,789
and uh and so that's that's viewed as a
benefit

1286
00:23:20,789 --> 00:23:20,799
benefit
 

1287
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,990

so the what's being missed here
 

1289
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,110
so the what's being missed here
like the suffering of the average person

like metrics that captured that within
the economic system is that is it when

you know

1350
00:24:35,269 --> 00:24:35,279
you know
 

1351
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:36,630
you know
remember when jerome powell said our

deed to this house sold in 1930.
okay and uh

1362
00:24:50,149 --> 00:24:50,159
okay and uh
 

1363
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,310
okay and uh
the number on that deed is one hundred

1364
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:52,320
the number on that deed is one hundred
 

1365
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,590
the number on that deed is one hundred
thousand dollars

1366
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:53,600
thousand dollars
 

1367
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,870
thousand dollars
1930. and if you go on zillow

1368
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:56,880
1930. and if you go on zillow
 

1369
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,190
1930. and if you go on zillow
and you get the z estimate is it higher

1370
00:24:59,190 --> 00:24:59,200
and you get the z estimate is it higher
 

1371
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,990
and you get the z estimate is it higher
than that no 30 million 500 000

1372
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:02,000
than that no 30 million 500 000
 

1373
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,789
than that no 30 million 500 000
yeah

1374
00:25:02,789 --> 00:25:02,799
yeah
 

1375
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:04,230
yeah
so

1376
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:04,240
so
 

1377
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,470
so
that's uh 92 years 1930 or

1378
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:07,480
that's uh 92 years 1930 or
 

1379
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,269
that's uh 92 years 1930 or
2022

2022
 

1381
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:10,310
2022
and

1382
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:10,320
and
 

1383
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,149
and
and in 92 years we've had 305

1384
00:25:14,149 --> 00:25:14,159
and in 92 years we've had 305
 

1385
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,110
and in 92 years we've had 305

now if you actually back calculate you

1388
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:19,360
now if you actually back calculate you
 

1389
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,510
now if you actually back calculate you
can you come to a conclusion that the

1390
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:21,520
can you come to a conclusion that the
 

1391
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,350
can you come to a conclusion that the

typical investor thinks they they're 10

1486
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:12,080
typical investor thinks they they're 10
 

1487
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,590
typical investor thinks they they're 10
better every year

1488
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:13,600
better every year
 

1489
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,870
better every year
so if you look at what's going on really

1490
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:16,880
so if you look at what's going on really
 

1491
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,549
so if you look at what's going on really
when you're holding a million dollars of

1492
00:27:18,549 --> 00:27:18,559
when you're holding a million dollars of
 

1493
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:20,710
when you're holding a million dollars of
stocks and you're getting a 10 gain a

1494
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:20,720
stocks and you're getting a 10 gain a
 

1495
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,110
stocks and you're getting a 10 gain a
year you really get a seven percent

1496
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:23,120
year you really get a seven percent
 

1497
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,269
year you really get a seven percent
expansion of the money supply

1498
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:25,279
expansion of the money supply
 

1499
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:26,950
expansion of the money supply
you're getting a two or three percent

1500
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:26,960
you're getting a two or three percent
 

1501
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,909
you're getting a two or three percent
gain under best circumstances

1502
00:27:29,909 --> 00:27:29,919
gain under best circumstances
 

1503
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:30,710
gain under best circumstances
and

1504
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:30,720
and
 

1505
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,110
and
another way to say that is

1506
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:33,120
another way to say that is
 

1507
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,110
another way to say that is
if the money supply stopped expanding at

1508
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:35,120
if the money supply stopped expanding at
 

1509
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,269
if the money supply stopped expanding at
seven percent a year the s p yield might

1510
00:27:37,269 --> 00:27:37,279
seven percent a year the s p yield might
 

1511
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:39,590
seven percent a year the s p yield might
be three percent and not ten percent it

1512
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:39,600
be three percent and not ten percent it
 

1513
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,630
be three percent and not ten percent it
probably should be

1514
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:42,640

 

1515
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,350

now that that gets you to start to ask a

1516
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:45,360
now that that gets you to start to ask a
 

1517
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,029
now that that gets you to start to ask a
bunch of other fundamental questions

1518
00:27:47,029 --> 00:27:47,039
bunch of other fundamental questions
 

1519
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,830
bunch of other fundamental questions
like if i borrow a billion dollars and

1520
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:49,840
like if i borrow a billion dollars and
 

1521
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,669
like if i borrow a billion dollars and
pay three percent interest and the money

1522
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:51,679
pay three percent interest and the money
 

1523
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:54,389
pay three percent interest and the money
supply expands at seven to ten percent a

1524
00:27:54,389 --> 00:27:54,399
supply expands at seven to ten percent a
 

1525
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:55,830
supply expands at seven to ten percent a
year and

1526
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:55,840
year and
 

1527
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,789
year and
i ended up making a ten percent return

1528
00:27:58,789 --> 00:27:58,799
i ended up making a ten percent return
 

1529
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,870
i ended up making a ten percent return
on a you know billion dollar investment

1530
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:00,880
on a you know billion dollar investment
 

1531
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,389
on a you know billion dollar investment
paying three percent interest is that

1532
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:02,399
paying three percent interest is that
 

1533
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:03,750
paying three percent interest is that
fair

1534
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:03,760
fair
 

1535
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,909
fair
and who who suffered

1536
00:28:05,909 --> 00:28:05,919
and who who suffered
 

1537
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,110
and who who suffered
so that i could do that because

1538
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:09,120
so that i could do that because
 

1539
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,789
so that i could do that because
in an environment where you're just

1540
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:10,799
in an environment where you're just
 

1541
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,630
in an environment where you're just
inflating the money supply and you're

1542
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:12,640
inflating the money supply and you're
 

1543
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,110
inflating the money supply and you're
holding the assets constant

1544
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:15,120
holding the assets constant
 

1545
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,029
holding the assets constant
it stands the reason that the price of

1546
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:17,039
it stands the reason that the price of
 

1547
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:20,470
it stands the reason that the price of
all the assets is going to appreciate

1548
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:20,480
all the assets is going to appreciate
 

1549
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,070
all the assets is going to appreciate
somewhat proportional to the money

1550
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:22,080
somewhat proportional to the money
 

1551
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,269
somewhat proportional to the money
supply

1552
00:28:23,269 --> 00:28:23,279
supply
 

1553
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:24,549
supply
and the difference in asset

1554
00:28:24,549 --> 00:28:24,559
and the difference in asset
 

1555
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:26,630
and the difference in asset
appreciations is going to be a function

1556
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:26,640
appreciations is going to be a function
 

1557
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,950
appreciations is going to be a function
of the scarce desirable quality of the

1558
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:28,960
of the scarce desirable quality of the
 

1559
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,350
of the scarce desirable quality of the
assets and to what extent can i make

1560
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:31,360
assets and to what extent can i make
 

1561
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,149
assets and to what extent can i make
more of them and to what extent are they

1562
00:28:34,149 --> 00:28:34,159
more of them and to what extent are they
 

1563
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:37,830
more of them and to what extent are they
are they truly limited in supply

1564
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:37,840
are they truly limited in supply
 

1565
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,070
are they truly limited in supply
yeah so we'll we'll get to a lot of the

1566
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:40,080
yeah so we'll we'll get to a lot of the
 

1567
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,269
yeah so we'll we'll get to a lot of the
words you said there the scarcity

1568
00:28:43,269 --> 00:28:43,279
words you said there the scarcity
 

1569
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:46,230
words you said there the scarcity
uh and it's so good connected to how

1570
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:46,240
uh and it's so good connected to how
 

1571
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,110
uh and it's so good connected to how
limited they are and the value of those

1572
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:49,120
limited they are and the value of those
 

1573
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,110
limited they are and the value of those
assets but you also said so the

1574
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:51,120
assets but you also said so the
 

1575
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,470
assets but you also said so the
expansion of the money supply you just

1576
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:54,480
expansion of the money supply you just
 

1577
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,110
expansion of the money supply you just
put another way is printing money and so

1578
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:57,120
put another way is printing money and so
 

1579
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,110
put another way is printing money and so
is is that always bad the expansion of

1580
00:28:59,110 --> 00:28:59,120
is is that always bad the expansion of
 

1581
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,230
is is that always bad the expansion of
the money supply is this just uh to put

1582
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:02,240
the money supply is this just uh to put
 

1583
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,990
the money supply is this just uh to put
some terms on the table so we understand

1584
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:04,000
some terms on the table so we understand
 

1585
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,789
some terms on the table so we understand
them

1586
00:29:04,789 --> 00:29:04,799
them
 

1587
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,470
them
um

1588
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:06,480
um
 

1589
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,630
um
you nonchalantly say it's always

1590
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:08,640
you nonchalantly say it's always
 

1591
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,870
you nonchalantly say it's always
the on average expanding every year the

1592
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:10,880
the on average expanding every year the
 

1593
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,549
the on average expanding every year the
money supply is expanding every year by

1594
00:29:12,549 --> 00:29:12,559
money supply is expanding every year by
 

1595
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,789
money supply is expanding every year by
seven percent that's a bad thing that's

1596
00:29:14,789 --> 00:29:14,799
seven percent that's a bad thing that's
 

1597
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:17,029
seven percent that's a bad thing that's
a universally bad thing

1598
00:29:17,029 --> 00:29:17,039
a universally bad thing
 

1599
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,149
a universally bad thing
it's awful

1600
00:29:18,149 --> 00:29:18,159
it's awful
 

1601
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:20,789
it's awful
well i guess i guess to be precise

1602
00:29:20,789 --> 00:29:20,799
well i guess i guess to be precise
 

1603
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:23,190
well i guess i guess to be precise
uh it's the currency

1604
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:23,200
uh it's the currency
 

1605
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,310
uh it's the currency
that i mean

1606
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:24,320
that i mean
 

1607
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,029
that i mean
my money uh i would say money is

1608
00:29:27,029 --> 00:29:27,039
my money uh i would say money is
 

1609
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,230
my money uh i would say money is
monetary energy or economic energy

1610
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:30,240
monetary energy or economic energy
 

1611
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,710
monetary energy or economic energy
and the economic energy has to find its

1612
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:32,720
and the economic energy has to find its
 

1613
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,269
and the economic energy has to find its
way into a medium so if you want to move

1614
00:29:35,269 --> 00:29:35,279
way into a medium so if you want to move
 

1615
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,269
way into a medium so if you want to move
it rapidly as a medium of exchange has

1616
00:29:37,269 --> 00:29:37,279
it rapidly as a medium of exchange has
 

1617
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:39,510
it rapidly as a medium of exchange has
to find its way into currency but the

1618
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:39,520
to find its way into currency but the
 

1619
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,230
to find its way into currency but the
money can also flow into property like a

1620
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:42,240
money can also flow into property like a
 

1621
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,149
money can also flow into property like a
house or gold

1622
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:44,159
house or gold
 

1623
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,710
house or gold
if the money flows into property

1624
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:46,720
if the money flows into property
 

1625
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,149
if the money flows into property
it'll probably

1626
00:29:48,149 --> 00:29:48,159
it'll probably
 

1627
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,389
it'll probably
hold its value much better if the money

1628
00:29:50,389 --> 00:29:50,399
hold its value much better if the money
 

1629
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:53,110
hold its value much better if the money
flows into currency right if you had put

1630
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:53,120
flows into currency right if you had put
 

1631
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,990
flows into currency right if you had put
a hundred thousand dollars in this house

1632
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:56,000
a hundred thousand dollars in this house
 

1633
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,110
a hundred thousand dollars in this house
you would have 305 x return over 92

1634
00:29:59,110 --> 00:29:59,120
you would have 305 x return over 92
 

1635
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,950
you would have 305 x return over 92
years but if you had put the money a

1636
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:00,960
years but if you had put the money a
 

1637
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,230
years but if you had put the money a
hundred thousand dollars in a safe

1638
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:02,240
hundred thousand dollars in a safe
 

1639
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,830
hundred thousand dollars in a safe
deposit box and buried it in the

1640
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:03,840
deposit box and buried it in the
 

1641
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,110
deposit box and buried it in the
basement

1642
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:05,120
basement
 

1643
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,149
basement
you would have lost 99.7

1644
00:30:08,149 --> 00:30:08,159
you would have lost 99.7
 

1645

with the phrase assume an adiabatic

1676
00:30:40,789 --> 00:30:40,799
with the phrase assume an adiabatic
 

1677
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,510
with the phrase assume an adiabatic
system and what that means is a closed

1678
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:43,520
system and what that means is a closed
 

1679
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,909
system and what that means is a closed
system okay so i've got it i've got a

1680
00:30:45,909 --> 00:30:45,919
system okay so i've got it i've got a
 

1681
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:48,710
system okay so i've got it i've got a
container and in that container no air

1682
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:48,720
container and in that container no air
 

1683
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,750
container and in that container no air
leaves and no air enters no energy exits

1684
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:51,760
leaves and no air enters no energy exits
 

1685
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,389
leaves and no air enters no energy exits
or enters so it's a closed system

1686
00:30:54,389 --> 00:30:54,399
or enters so it's a closed system
 

1687
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:57,029
or enters so it's a closed system
so you got the closed system lapse

1688
00:30:57,029 --> 00:30:57,039
so you got the closed system lapse
 

1689
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:59,110
so you got the closed system lapse
okay

1690
00:30:59,110 --> 00:30:59,120
okay
 

1691
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,190
okay
okay i'm going to use a there's a leak

1692
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:01,200
okay i'm going to use a there's a leak
 

1693
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,350
okay i'm going to use a there's a leak
in the ship i'm going to use a physical

1694
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:03,360
in the ship i'm going to use a physical
 

1695

jujitsu right like like you got 10 pints

1698
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:07,360
jujitsu right like like you got 10 pints
 

1699
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,190
jujitsu right like like you got 10 pints
of blood in your body

1700
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:09,200
of blood in your body
 

1701
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,350
of blood in your body
and so before your next

1702
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:11,360
and so before your next
 

1703
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,509
and so before your next
workout i'm going to take one pint from

1704
00:31:13,509 --> 00:31:13,519
workout i'm going to take one pint from
 

1705
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:14,870
workout i'm going to take one pint from
you

1706
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:14,880
you
 

1707
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,470
you
now you're going to go exercise but

1708
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:16,480
now you're going to go exercise but
 

1709
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,230
now you're going to go exercise but
you're one point you've lost 10 percent

1710
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:18,240
you're one point you've lost 10 percent
 

1711
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,830
you're one point you've lost 10 percent
of your blood

1712
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:19,840
of your blood
 

1713
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,269
of your blood
okay

1714
00:31:21,269 --> 00:31:21,279
okay
 

1715
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:22,870
okay
you're not going to perform as well it

1716
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:22,880
you're not going to perform as well it
 

1717
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,350
you're not going to perform as well it
takes about one month for your body to

1718
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:25,360
takes about one month for your body to
 

1719
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,909
takes about one month for your body to
replace the red blood platelets so what

1720
00:31:27,909 --> 00:31:27,919
replace the red blood platelets so what
 

1721
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:29,430
replace the red blood platelets so what
if i tell you every month you got to

1722
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:29,440
if i tell you every month you got to
 

1723
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,269
if i tell you every month you got to
show up and i'm going to bleed you

1724
00:31:31,269 --> 00:31:31,279
show up and i'm going to bleed you
 

1725
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:34,710
show up and i'm going to bleed you
yeah okay so uh so if i'm draining the

1726
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:34,720
yeah okay so uh so if i'm draining the
 

1727
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,190
yeah okay so uh so if i'm draining the
energy i'm drink i'm draining the blood

1728
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:37,200
energy i'm drink i'm draining the blood
 

1729
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,350
energy i'm drink i'm draining the blood
from your body you can't perform

1730
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:39,360
from your body you can't perform
 

1731
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,990
from your body you can't perform
if you adiabatic lapse is when you go up

1732
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:42,000
if you adiabatic lapse is when you go up
 

1733
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,149
if you adiabatic lapse is when you go up
in altitude every thousand feet you lose

1734
00:31:44,149 --> 00:31:44,159
in altitude every thousand feet you lose
 

1735
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:45,590
in altitude every thousand feet you lose
three degrees

1736
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:45,600
three degrees
 

1737
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,870
three degrees
you go 50 000 feet you're 150 degrees

1738
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:48,880
you go 50 000 feet you're 150 degrees
 

1739
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,870
you go 50 000 feet you're 150 degrees
colder than sea level that's why you you

1740
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:50,880
colder than sea level that's why you you
 

1741
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,789
colder than sea level that's why you you
know you look at your

1742
00:31:52,789 --> 00:31:52,799
know you look at your
 

1743
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,710
know you look at your
instruments and instead of 80 degrees

1744
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:54,720
instruments and instead of 80 degrees
 

1745
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,710
instruments and instead of 80 degrees
your minus 70 degrees

1746
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:56,720
your minus 70 degrees
 

1747
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,710
your minus 70 degrees
why is the temperature falling

1748
00:31:58,710 --> 00:31:58,720
why is the temperature falling
 

1749
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,870
why is the temperature falling
temperatures falling because it's not a

1750
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:00,880
temperatures falling because it's not a
 

1751
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,269
temperatures falling because it's not a
closed system it's an open system as the

1752
00:32:03,269 --> 00:32:03,279
closed system it's an open system as the
 

1753
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:06,310
closed system it's an open system as the
air expands the density falls

1754
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:06,320
air expands the density falls
 

1755
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,669
air expands the density falls
right the ener

1756
00:32:07,669 --> 00:32:07,679
right the ener
 

1757
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:09,909
right the ener
the energy

1758
00:32:09,909 --> 00:32:09,919
the energy
 

1759
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:10,710
the energy
per

1760
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:10,720
per
 

1761
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,909
per
uh

1762
00:32:11,909 --> 00:32:11,919
uh
 

1763
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:14,789
uh
per cubic whatever you know falls and

1764
00:32:14,789 --> 00:32:14,799
per cubic whatever you know falls and
 

1765
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,630
per cubic whatever you know falls and
therefore the temperature falls right

1766
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:16,640
therefore the temperature falls right
 

1767
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,870
therefore the temperature falls right
the heat's falling out of the solution

1768
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:18,880
the heat's falling out of the solution
 

1769
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,389
the heat's falling out of the solution
so

1770
00:32:20,389 --> 00:32:20,399
so
 

1771
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,310
so
when you're inflating let's say you're

1772
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:22,320
when you're inflating let's say you're
 

1773
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,990
when you're inflating let's say you're
inflating the money so the currency

1774
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:24,000
inflating the money so the currency
 

1775
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,710
inflating the money so the currency

1777
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,590
supply by six percent you're sucking six
percent of the energy

1778
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:29,600

currency is the asset we use uh to move
monetary energy around and you could use

1804
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:00,240
monetary energy around and you could use
 

1805
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,630
monetary energy around and you could use
the dollar or you could use the peso or

1806
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:02,640
the dollar or you could use the peso or
 

1807
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,269
the dollar or you could use the peso or
you could use the bolivar selling houses

1808
00:33:05,269 --> 00:33:05,279
you could use the bolivar selling houses
 

1809
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:06,710
you could use the bolivar selling houses
and buying houses is much more

1810
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:06,720
and buying houses is much more
 

1811
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,070
and buying houses is much more
inefficient

1812
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:08,080
inefficient
 

1813
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,590
inefficient
or like

1814
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:09,600
or like
 

1815
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,789
or like
you can't

you can't
transact between billions of people with

houses yeah properties don't make such
 

1821
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,029
houses yeah properties don't make such
good mediums of exchange they make

1822
00:33:19,029 --> 00:33:19,039
good mediums of exchange they make
 

1823
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:21,269
good mediums of exchange they make
better stores of value and they they

1824
00:33:21,269 --> 00:33:21,279
better stores of value and they they
 

1825
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:23,990
better stores of value and they they
have utility value if it's a if it's a

policymakers are well-intentioned but
 

1861
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:59,430

generally all all government policy is

1862
00:33:59,430 --> 00:33:59,440
generally all all government policy is
 

1863
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,750
generally all all government policy is
inflationary and all government it's

1864
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:01,760
inflationary and all government it's
 

1865
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,909
inflationary and all government it's
inflammatory and inflationary so what i

mean by that is
 

1869
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,629
mean by that is
you know when you have a policy uh

1870
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:08,639
you know when you have a policy uh
 

1871
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,149

1935
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,990
i idle the factory in the far east it
goes to 50 capacity so so whatever it

1936
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:20,000
goes to 50 capacity so so whatever it
 

1937
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,390
goes to 50 capacity so so whatever it
sells it has to raise the price on and

sells it has to raise the price on and
 

1939
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,550
sells it has to raise the price on and
then i drive up the cost of labor for

then i drive up the cost of labor for
 

1941
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,630

every other manufacturer in the us
 

1943
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,589
every other manufacturer in the us
because i competing against them

1944

because i competing against them
 

1945
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:32,069
because i competing against them
right i'm changing their conditions so

1946
00:35:32,069 --> 00:35:32,079
right i'm changing their conditions so
 

1947
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:33,430
right i'm changing their conditions so
everything gets less efficient

1948
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:33,440
everything gets less efficient
 

1949
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,670
everything gets less efficient
everything gets more expensive and of

1950
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:35,680
everything gets more expensive and of
 

1951
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,190
everything gets more expensive and of
course the government couldn't really

1952
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:37,200
course the government couldn't really
 

1953
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,310
course the government couldn't really
pay for

1954

many good ideas and you know they all

2058
00:37:40,069 --> 00:37:40,079
many good ideas and you know they all

00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:41,589
many good ideas and you know they all
sound good

sound good
but there's just a limit to to what you

2062
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:43,760
but there's just a limit to to what you
 

2063
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,510
but there's just a limit to to what you
can accomplish

2064
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:45,520
can accomplish
 

2065
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,670
can accomplish
and everybody underestimates the

2066
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:47,680
and everybody underestimates the
 

2067
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,510
and everybody underestimates the
challenges

2068
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:49,520
challenges
 

2069
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,710
challenges
of of implementing an idea

2070
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:52,720
of of implementing an idea
 

2071
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,030
of of implementing an idea
right and uh and they always

2072
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:55,040
right and uh and they always
 

2073
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,349
right and uh and they always
overestimate the benefits

2074
00:37:57,349 --> 00:37:57,359
overestimate the benefits
 

2075
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:59,510
overestimate the benefits
of the pursuit of that so i think it's

2076
00:37:59,510 --> 00:37:59,520
of the pursuit of that so i think it's
 

2077
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,390
of the pursuit of that so i think it's
an overconfidence that causes an over

2078
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:02,400
an overconfidence that causes an over
 

2079
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,310
an overconfidence that causes an over
exuberance and pursuit of policies and

exuberance and pursuit of policies and
 

2081
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,829
exuberance and pursuit of policies and
as the ambition of the government

2082
00:38:07,829 --> 00:38:07,839
as the ambition of the government
 

2083
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:12,950
as the ambition of the government
expands so must the currency supply

2084
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:12,960
expands so must the currency supply
 

2085
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,230
expands so must the currency supply
you know i could say the money survival

2086
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:14,240
you know i could say the money survival
 

2087
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,150
you know i could say the money survival
let's say the currency supply

2088
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:16,160
let's say the currency supply
 

2089
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,349
let's say the currency supply
um

2090
00:38:17,349 --> 00:38:17,359
um
 

2091
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:19,670
um
you can triple the number of pesos in

2092
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:19,680
you can triple the number of pesos in
 

2093
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,109
you can triple the number of pesos in
the economy

2094
00:38:21,109 --> 00:38:21,119
the economy
 

2095
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:23,510
the economy
but it doesn't triple uh the amount of

2096
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:23,520
but it doesn't triple uh the amount of
 

2097
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,430
but it doesn't triple uh the amount of
manufacturing capacity in the said

2098
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:25,440
manufacturing capacity in the said
 

2099

economy
 

2101
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,550
economy
and it doesn't triple the amount of

2102
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:28,560
and it doesn't triple the amount of
 

2103
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,310
and it doesn't triple the amount of
assets in the economy it just triples

2104
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:30,320
assets in the economy it just triples
 

2105
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,950
assets in the economy it just triples
the pesos so as you

2106
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:32,960
the pesos so as you
 

2107
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,510
the pesos so as you
increase the currency supply

2108
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:35,520
increase the currency supply
 

2109
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,069
increase the currency supply
then the price of all those scarce

2110
00:38:38,069 --> 00:38:38,079
then the price of all those scarce
 

2111
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:40,950
then the price of all those scarce
desirable things will tend to go up

2112
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:40,960
desirable things will tend to go up
 

2113
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,390
desirable things will tend to go up
rapidly

rapidly
 

2115
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,310
rapidly
and the confidence

that are anti-inflation
 

2295
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:12,230
that are anti-inflation
but again it it just signifies a lack of

00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:22,390
which was completely
non-inflationary if if i never printed

will it will create more harm than good
in the pursuit of it but it is what it

in the pursuit of it but it is what it
 

2375
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,510
in the pursuit of it but it is what it
is the secondary

is the secondary
 

2377
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:45,270
is the secondary
uh the secondary issue is they will

2378
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:45,280
uh the secondary issue is they will
 

2379
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,910
uh the secondary issue is they will
unintentionally pay for it by expanding

2380
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:47,920
unintentionally pay for it by expanding
 

2381

that they're uh

that they're uh
they're actually paying for it in

they're actually paying for it in
 

2387
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,430
they're actually paying for it in
in a sub-optimal fashion they'll

2388
00:43:59,430 --> 00:43:59,440
in a sub-optimal fashion they'll
 

2389
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,349
in a sub-optimal fashion they'll
collapse their own currencies while they

2390
00:44:01,349 --> 00:44:01,359
collapse their own currencies while they
 

2391
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:03,829
collapse their own currencies while they
attempt to do good the the tertiary

2392
00:44:03,829 --> 00:44:03,839
attempt to do good the the tertiary
 

2393
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:06,710
attempt to do good the the tertiary
issue is they will mismeasure

2394
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:06,720
issue is they will mismeasure
 

2395
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,309
issue is they will mismeasure
how badly they're collapsing the

2396
00:44:08,309 --> 00:44:08,319
how badly they're collapsing the
 

2397
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:09,589
how badly they're collapsing the

so for example if you go to the bureau

2400
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:11,280
so for example if you go to the bureau
 

2401
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:14,230
so for example if you go to the bureau
of labor statistics you know and look at

2402
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:14,240
of labor statistics you know and look at
 

2403
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,230
of labor statistics you know and look at
the numbers printed by the fed they'll

2404
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:16,240
the numbers printed by the fed they'll
 

2405
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,390
the numbers printed by the fed they'll
say oh it looks like the dollar has lost

2406
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:18,400
say oh it looks like the dollar has lost
 

2407
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,870
say oh it looks like the dollar has lost
95 of its purchasing power over 100

2408
00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:20,880
95 of its purchasing power over 100
 

2409
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,069
95 of its purchasing power over 100
years okay they sort of fess up there's

2410
00:44:24,069 --> 00:44:24,079
years okay they sort of fess up there's
 

2411
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:26,390
years okay they sort of fess up there's
a problem but they make it 95 percent

2412
00:44:26,390 --> 00:44:26,400
a problem but they make it 95 percent
 

2413
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,790
a problem but they make it 95 percent
loss over 100 years what they don't do

2414
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:28,800
loss over 100 years what they don't do
 

2415
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:29,750
loss over 100 years what they don't do
is

2416
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:29,760
is
 

2417
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:32,150
is
realize it's a 99.7

2418
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:32,160
realize it's a 99.7
 

2419
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,829
realize it's a 99.7
loss over 80 years so they will

2420
00:44:34,829 --> 00:44:34,839
loss over 80 years so they will
 

2421
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:38,390
loss over 80 years so they will
mismeasure just the horrific extent

2422
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:38,400
mismeasure just the horrific extent
 

2423
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:42,710
mismeasure just the horrific extent
of uh the monetary policy in pursuit of

2424
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:42,720
of uh the monetary policy in pursuit of

because
 

2445
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:07,190
because
the mental models that they use that are

conventionally taught
 

2449
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:12,470
conventionally taught
are wrong right the mental model that

are wrong right the mental model that
 

2451
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,230
are wrong right the mental model that
like it's okay we can print all this

00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:14,240
like it's okay we can print all this
 

2453
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,470
like it's okay we can print all this
money because the velocity of the money

2454
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:16,480
money because the velocity of the money
 

2455
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:20,630
money because the velocity of the money
is low right because money velocity is a

2456
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:20,640
is low right because money velocity is a
 

2457
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,190
is low right because money velocity is a
scalar and inflation is the scalar and

2458
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:23,200
scalar and inflation is the scalar and
 

2459
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,109
scalar and inflation is the scalar and
we don't see two percent inflation yet

2460
00:45:25,109 --> 00:45:25,119
we don't see two percent inflation yet
 

2461
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:26,630
we don't see two percent inflation yet
and the money velocity is low and so

2462
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:26,640
and the money velocity is low and so
 

2463
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,390
and the money velocity is low and so
it's okay if we print

2464
00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:28,400
it's okay if we print
 

2465
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,710
it's okay if we print
trillions of dollars well

2466
00:45:30,710 --> 00:45:30,720
trillions of dollars well
 

2467
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:33,750
trillions of dollars well
the money velocity was immediate

2468
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:33,760
the money velocity was immediate
 

2469
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,910
the money velocity was immediate
right the velocity of money through the

2470
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:35,920
right the velocity of money through the
 

2471
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,910
right the velocity of money through the
crypto economy

2472
00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:37,920
crypto economy
 

2473
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,950
crypto economy
is 10 000 times faster

2474
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:40,960
is 10 000 times faster
 

2475
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,870
is 10 000 times faster
than the velocity of money through the

2476
00:45:42,870 --> 00:45:42,880
than the velocity of money through the
 

2477
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,190
than the velocity of money through the
consumer economy

2478
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:45,200
consumer economy
 

2479
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,030
consumer economy
right it's like i think nick pointed out

2480
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:47,040
right it's like i think nick pointed out
 

2481
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,950
right it's like i think nick pointed out
when you spoke to him he said it takes

2482
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:48,960
when you spoke to him he said it takes
 

2483
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,030
when you spoke to him he said it takes
two months for a credit card transaction

2484
00:45:51,030 --> 00:45:51,040
two months for a credit card transaction
 

2485
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,230
two months for a credit card transaction
to settle

2486
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:52,240
to settle
 

2487
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,750
to settle
right so you want to spend a million

2488
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:53,760
right so you want to spend a million
 

2489
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,790
right so you want to spend a million
dollars in the consumer economy you can

2490
00:45:56,790 --> 00:45:56,800
dollars in the consumer economy you can
 

2491
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,030
dollars in the consumer economy you can
move it six times a year

2492
00:45:59,030 --> 00:45:59,040
move it six times a year
 

2493
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,430
move it six times a year
you you put a million dollars into gold

2494
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:01,440
you you put a million dollars into gold
 

2495
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,750
you you put a million dollars into gold
gold will sit in a vault for a decade

2496
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:03,760
gold will sit in a vault for a decade
 

2497
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,349
gold will sit in a vault for a decade
okay so the velocity of money through

2498
00:46:05,349 --> 00:46:05,359
okay so the velocity of money through
 

2499
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:08,069
okay so the velocity of money through
gold is 0.1

2500
00:46:08,069 --> 00:46:08,079
gold is 0.1
 

2501
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:09,750
gold is 0.1
you put the money in the stock market

2502
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:09,760
you put the money in the stock market
 

2503
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,430
you put the money in the stock market
and you can trade it once a week the

2504
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:11,440
and you can trade it once a week the
 

2505
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,750
and you can trade it once a week the
settlement is t plus 2 maybe you get to

2506
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:13,760
settlement is t plus 2 maybe you get to
 

2507
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,910
settlement is t plus 2 maybe you get to
two to one leverage you might get to a

2508
00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:15,920
two to one leverage you might get to a
 

2509
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,309
two to one leverage you might get to a
money velocity of a hundred a year

2510
00:46:18,309 --> 00:46:18,319
money velocity of a hundred a year
 

2511
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:20,150
money velocity of a hundred a year
in the stock market

2512
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:20,160
in the stock market
 

2513
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,910
in the stock market
you put your money into the crypto

2514
00:46:21,910 --> 00:46:21,920
you put your money into the crypto
 

2515
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,430
you put your money into the crypto
economy and these people are settling

2516
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:23,440
economy and these people are settling
 

2517
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,589
economy and these people are settling
every four hours

2518
00:46:25,589 --> 00:46:25,599
every four hours
 

2519
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:27,829
every four hours
and and you know if you're offshore

2520
00:46:27,829 --> 00:46:27,839
and and you know if you're offshore
 

2521
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:30,150
and and you know if you're offshore
they're trading with 20x leverage

2522
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:30,160
they're trading with 20x leverage
 

2523
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,630
they're trading with 20x leverage
so if you if you settle every day

2524
00:46:32,630 --> 00:46:32,640
so if you if you settle every day
 

2525
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,710
so if you if you settle every day
and you trade the 20x leverage you just

2526
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:34,720
and you trade the 20x leverage you just
 

2527
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:37,190
and you trade the 20x leverage you just
went to 7 000.

2528
00:46:37,190 --> 00:46:37,200
went to 7 000.
 

2529
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:41,510
went to 7 000.
yeah so the la the velocity of the money

2530
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:41,520
yeah so the la the velocity of the money
 

2531
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,309
yeah so the la the velocity of the money
varies i think the politicians they they

2532
00:46:44,309 --> 00:46:44,319
varies i think the politicians they they
 

2533
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:46,309
varies i think the politicians they they
don't really understand inflation and

2534
00:46:46,309 --> 00:46:46,319
don't really understand inflation and
 

2535
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:48,710
don't really understand inflation and
they don't understand economics but but

2536
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:48,720
they don't understand economics but but
 

2537
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,230
they don't understand economics but but
you can't blame them

2538
00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:50,240
you can't blame them
 

2539
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,069
you can't blame them
because the economists don't understand

2540
00:46:52,069 --> 00:46:52,079
because the economists don't understand
 

2541
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:54,390
because the economists don't understand
economics because the because if they

2542
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:54,400
economics because the because if they
 

2543
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:55,270
economics because the because if they
did

2544
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:55,280
did
 

2545
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:56,990
did
they would be creating

2546
00:46:56,990 --> 00:46:57,000
they would be creating
 

2547
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,309
they would be creating
multi-variate computer simulations where

2548
00:47:00,309 --> 00:47:00,319
multi-variate computer simulations where
 

2549
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:02,069
multi-variate computer simulations where
they actually put in

2550
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:02,079
they actually put in
 

2551
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:03,270
they actually put in
the price

2552
00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:03,280
the price
 

2553
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,430
the price
of every piece of housing in every city

2554
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:05,440
of every piece of housing in every city
 

2555
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,150
of every piece of housing in every city
in the world the full array of foods and

2556
00:47:08,150 --> 00:47:08,160
in the world the full array of foods and
 

2557
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,150
in the world the full array of foods and
the full array of products and the full

2558
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:10,160
the full array of products and the full
 

2559
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,069
the full array of products and the full
array of assets

2560
00:47:12,069 --> 00:47:12,079
array of assets
 

2561
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:13,109
array of assets
and then

2562
00:47:13,109 --> 00:47:13,119
and then
 

2563
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:15,750
and then
on a monthly basis they would publish

2564
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:15,760
on a monthly basis they would publish
 

2565
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:18,230
on a monthly basis they would publish
all those results and where and that's a

2566
00:47:18,230 --> 00:47:18,240
all those results and where and that's a
 

2567
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,069
all those results and where and that's a
high bandwidth

2568
00:47:20,069 --> 00:47:20,079
high bandwidth
 

2569
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:21,750
high bandwidth
requirement

2570
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:21,760
requirement
 

2571
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,670
requirement
and i i think that people don't really

2572
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:23,680
and i i think that people don't really
 

2573
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,190
and i i think that people don't really
want to embrace it

2574
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:25,200
want to embrace it
 

2575
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,270
want to embrace it
and and also there's the most pernicious

2576
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:27,280
and and also there's the most pernicious
 

2577
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:28,950
and and also there's the most pernicious
thing

2578
00:47:28,950 --> 00:47:28,960
thing
 

2579
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,470
thing
there's that phrase

2580
00:47:30,470 --> 00:47:30,480
there's that phrase
 

2581
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:31,270
there's that phrase
you know

2582
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:31,280
you know
 

2583
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,230
you know
you can't

2584
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:32,240
you can't
 

2585
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:33,589
you can't
tell people what to think but you can

2586
00:47:33,589 --> 00:47:33,599
tell people what to think but you can
 

2587
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:35,510
tell people what to think but you can
tell them what to think about the most

2588
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:35,520
tell them what to think about the most
 

2589
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,109
tell them what to think about the most
pernicious thing

2590
00:47:37,109 --> 00:47:37,119
pernicious thing
 

2591
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:41,030
pernicious thing
is is i get you to misunderstand

2592
00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:41,040
is is i get you to misunderstand
 

2593
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,710
is is i get you to misunderstand
the phenomena

2594
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:42,720
the phenomena
 

2595
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:46,549
the phenomena
so that even when it's happening to you

2596
00:47:46,549 --> 00:47:46,559
so that even when it's happening to you
 

2597
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:48,470
so that even when it's happening to you
you don't appreciate that it's a bad

2598
00:47:48,470 --> 00:47:48,480
you don't appreciate that it's a bad
 

2599
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,470
you don't appreciate that it's a bad
thing and you think it's a good thing so

2600
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:50,480
thing and you think it's a good thing so
 

2601
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:52,470
thing and you think it's a good thing so
if housing prices are going up 20

2602
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:52,480
if housing prices are going up 20
 

2603
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,470
if housing prices are going up 20
percent year over year and i say this is

2604
00:47:54,470 --> 00:47:54,480
percent year over year and i say this is
 

2605
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,230
percent year over year and i say this is
great for the american public because

2606
00:47:56,230 --> 00:47:56,240
great for the american public because
 

2607
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,470
great for the american public because
most most of them are home owners

2608
00:47:58,470 --> 00:47:58,480
most most of them are home owners
 

2609
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:01,030
most most of them are home owners
then i have i've misrepresented a

2610
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:01,040
then i have i've misrepresented a
 

2611
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:04,309
then i have i've misrepresented a
phenomena inflation is 20

2612
00:48:04,309 --> 00:48:04,319
phenomena inflation is 20
 

2613
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:06,670
phenomena inflation is 20
not 7 percent and then i've

00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:09,109
not 7 percent and then i've
misrepresented it as being a positive

misrepresented it as being a positive
 

2617
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:11,270
misrepresented it as being a positive

rather than a negative
 

2619
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,750
rather than a negative
and people will stare at it and you

2620
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:13,760
and people will stare at it and you
 

2621
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:17,430
and people will stare at it and you
could even show them their house on fire

2622
00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:17,440
could even show them their house on fire
 

2623
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,030
could even show them their house on fire
and they would perceive it as being

00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:19,040
and they would perceive it as being
 

2625
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,870

great because it's warming them up and

great because it's warming them up and
 

2627
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,390
great because it's warming them up and
they're going to save on their heat

2628

told you

told you
that

ship is rotting two percent a year that
 

2719
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,309
ship is rotting two percent a year that
means the useful life of the ship is 50

00:49:56,309 --> 00:49:56,319
means the useful life of the ship is 50
 

2721
00:49:56,319 --> 00:49:58,790
means the useful life of the ship is 50
years now ironically that's true like a

years now ironically that's true like a
 

2723
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,790
years now ironically that's true like a

not unlikely so when we built ships out

00:50:06,150 --> 00:50:06,160
not unlikely so when we built ships out

00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:07,270
not unlikely so when we built ships out

nothing good about it right you build a

00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:15,760
nothing good about it right you build a
 

2737
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,270
nothing good about it right you build a
ship out of steel

2738

ship out of steel
 

2739
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,589
ship out of steel
you know and it's zero as opposed to two

2740
00:50:19,589 --> 00:50:19,599
you know and it's zero as opposed to two
 

2741
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:21,670
you know and it's zero as opposed to two
percent degradation

2742
00:50:21,670 --> 00:50:21,680
percent degradation
 

2743
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,670
percent degradation
and how much better is zero percent

2744
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:23,680
and how much better is zero percent
 

2745
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,349
and how much better is zero percent
versus two percent

2746

versus two percent
 

2747
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:26,630

00:50:26,630 --> 00:50:26,640
well
 

2749
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,470
well
two percent means you have a useful life

2750
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:28,480
two percent means you have a useful life
 

2751
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:29,109
two percent means you have a useful life
of

2752
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:29,119
of
 

2753
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:30,150
of
you know

2754
00:50:30,150 --> 00:50:30,160
you know
 

2755
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,630
you know
it's half-life of 35 years

2756
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:32,640
it's half-life of 35 years
 

2757
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:35,270
it's half-life of 35 years
2 2 is a half-life of 35 years that's

2758
00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:35,280
2 2 is a half-life of 35 years that's
 

2759
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:37,589
2 2 is a half-life of 35 years that's
basically the half-life of money in gold

2760
00:50:37,589 --> 00:50:37,599
basically the half-life of money in gold
 

2761
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:40,630
basically the half-life of money in gold
if i store your life force in gold under

2762
00:50:40,630 --> 00:50:40,640
if i store your life force in gold under
 

2763
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,950
if i store your life force in gold under
perfect circumstances you have a useful

2764
00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:42,960
perfect circumstances you have a useful
 

2765
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,870
perfect circumstances you have a useful
life at 35 years

2766
00:50:44,870 --> 00:50:44,880
life at 35 years
 

2767
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:48,069
life at 35 years
zero percent is a useful life of forever

2768
00:50:48,069 --> 00:50:48,079
zero percent is a useful life of forever
 

2769
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:50,950
zero percent is a useful life of forever
so zero percent is immortal

2770
00:50:50,950 --> 00:50:50,960
so zero percent is immortal
 

2771
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,750
so zero percent is immortal
two percent is 35 years average life

2772
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:53,760
two percent is 35 years average life
 

2773
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,829
two percent is 35 years average life

it's the money has had a half-life of
 

2791
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:16,790
it's the money has had a half-life of
ten years except for the fact that

2792
00:51:16,790 --> 00:51:16,800
ten years except for the fact that

then some ideas can be really bad and
 

2983
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:40,870
then some ideas can be really bad and
really destructive but on average the

really destructive but on average the
 

2985

how did human civilization
 

3001
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:59,109
how did human civilization
originate on this earth

and what is this human project that

3004
00:55:00,870 --> 00:55:00,880
and what is this human project that
 

3005
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,030
and what is this human project that
we're all taking on

3006
00:55:03,030 --> 00:55:03,040
we're all taking on
 

3007
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:04,230
we're all taking on
you mentioned

3008
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:04,240
you mentioned
 

3009
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:06,710
you mentioned
fire and water and apparently bleeding

3010
00:55:06,710 --> 00:55:06,720
fire and water and apparently bleeding
 

3011
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,630
fire and water and apparently bleeding
you to death is not a good idea i

3012
00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:08,640
you to death is not a good idea i
 

3013
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:09,990
you to death is not a good idea i
thought always thought you can get the

3014
00:55:09,990 --> 00:55:10,000
thought always thought you can get the
 

3015
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,910
thought always thought you can get the
demons out in that way but

3016
00:55:11,910 --> 00:55:11,920
demons out in that way but
 

3017
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:13,670
demons out in that way but
um that was a recent

3018
00:55:13,670 --> 00:55:13,680
um that was a recent
 

3019
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,910
um that was a recent
invention so what what's this thing

3020
00:55:15,910 --> 00:55:15,920
invention so what what's this thing
 

3021
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:19,990
invention so what what's this thing
we're doing here

3022
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:20,000

 

3023
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,309

i think what distinguishes uh human

right from the point that we actually
started to play with fire

3050

started to play with fire
 

3051
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:53,670
started to play with fire
right that was a big leap forward

i think i mean the the the human story

3090
00:56:38,069 --> 00:56:38,079
i think i mean the the the human story
 

3091
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:40,309
i think i mean the the the human story
is really the story of engineering a

00:56:40,309 --> 00:56:40,319
is really the story of engineering a
 

3093
00:56:40,319 --> 00:56:43,030
is really the story of engineering a
better world

3094

better world
 

3095
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:45,990
better world
and and uh the rise in the human

3096
00:56:45,990 --> 00:56:46,000
and and uh the rise in the human
 

3097
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,670

condition is determined by those uh

3430
01:02:33,829 --> 01:02:33,839
you know you study the history of the
 

3431
01:02:33,839 --> 01:02:36,549
you know you study the history of the
balearic slingers right and you know you

3432
01:02:36,549 --> 01:02:36,559
balearic slingers right and you know you
 

3433
01:02:36,559 --> 01:02:38,549
balearic slingers right and you know you
think we invented bullets but they they

3434
01:02:38,549 --> 01:02:38,559
think we invented bullets but they they
 

3435
01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:40,950
think we invented bullets but they they
invented bullets to put in slings

3436
01:02:40,950 --> 01:02:40,960
invented bullets to put in slings
 

3437
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:43,270
invented bullets to put in slings
thousands of years ago they could have

3438
01:02:43,270 --> 01:02:43,280
thousands of years ago they could have
 

3439
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:45,910
thousands of years ago they could have
stood off 500 meters and put a hole in

3440
01:02:45,910 --> 01:02:45,920
stood off 500 meters and put a hole in
 

3441
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:46,870
stood off 500 meters and put a hole in
your head

your head
 

3443
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:50,069
your head
right and so there was never a time

3444
01:02:50,069 --> 01:02:50,079
right and so there was never a time
 

3445
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:53,029
right and so there was never a time
when uh when

3446

when uh when
 

3447
01:02:53,039 --> 01:02:55,829
when uh when
humanity wasn't vying

in europe and
 

3479
01:03:28,319 --> 01:03:30,549
in europe and
as long as they stayed organized

3480
01:03:30,549 --> 01:03:30,559
as long as they stayed organized
 

3481
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:32,710
as long as they stayed organized
they dominated and at some point they

3482
01:03:32,710 --> 01:03:32,720
they dominated and at some point they
 

3483
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:35,270
they dominated and at some point they
over expanded and got disorganized and

3484
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:35,280
over expanded and got disorganized and
 

3485
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:37,430
over expanded and got disorganized and
they collapsed

3486
01:03:37,430 --> 01:03:37,440
they collapsed
 

3487
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:39,510
they collapsed
and uh i guess you could say that you

3488
01:03:39,510 --> 01:03:39,520
and uh i guess you could say that you
 

3489
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:42,309
and uh i guess you could say that you
know the struggle of the human condition

they reject new ideas
 

3541
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:35,349
they reject new ideas
it's almost uh whether that's emergent

3542
01:04:35,349 --> 01:04:35,359
it's almost uh whether that's emergent
 

3543

it's almost uh whether that's emergent
or

or
 

3545
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:38,789
or
however that evolved

it seems to have a really interesting
effect because when you're young

you fight for the new ideas you push
 

3553
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:48,549
you fight for the new ideas you push
them through then a few of us

3554
01:04:48,549 --> 01:04:48,559
them through then a few of us
 

3555
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:51,270
them through then a few of us
humans find success then we get

3556

humans find success then we get
 

3557
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:52,710
humans find success then we get

3562
01:04:56,549 --> 01:04:56,559
idea and then
 

3563
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:59,029
idea and then
the the the new young person with the

is that still engineering your mind
 

3637
01:06:14,319 --> 01:06:16,549
is that still engineering your mind
you're starting to operate in these bits

3638
01:06:16,549 --> 01:06:16,559
you're starting to operate in these bits
 

3639
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:19,109
you're starting to operate in these bits
of information

3640
01:06:19,109 --> 01:06:19,119
of information
 

3641
01:06:19,119 --> 01:06:21,750
of information
i think there's two big ideas uh the

3642
01:06:21,750 --> 01:06:21,760
i think there's two big ideas uh the
 

3643
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:23,109
i think there's two big ideas uh the
first wave

3644
01:06:23,109 --> 01:06:23,119
first wave
 

3645
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:25,510
first wave
of ideas were digital information and

3646
01:06:25,510 --> 01:06:25,520
of ideas were digital information and
 

3647
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:27,190
of ideas were digital information and
that was the internet way been running

3648
01:06:27,190 --> 01:06:27,200
that was the internet way been running
 

3649
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:28,349
that was the internet way been running
since

3650
01:06:28,349 --> 01:06:28,359
since
 

3651
01:06:28,359 --> 01:06:31,750
since
1990 or so for 30 years and the second

3652
01:06:31,750 --> 01:06:31,760
1990 or so for 30 years and the second
 

3653
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:34,390
1990 or so for 30 years and the second
wave is digital energy

3654
01:06:34,390 --> 01:06:34,400
wave is digital energy
 

3655
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:37,910
wave is digital energy
so if i look at digital information

3656
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:37,920
so if i look at digital information
 

3657
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:40,309
so if i look at digital information
this idea that we want to digitally

3658
01:06:40,309 --> 01:06:40,319
this idea that we want to digitally
 

3659
01:06:40,319 --> 01:06:42,789
this idea that we want to digitally

it's a crystallization when we collapse

3692
01:07:16,870 --> 01:07:16,880
it's a crystallization when we collapse
 

3693
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:18,470
it's a crystallization when we collapse
into a lower energy state as a

like if you look at what carnegie did

3700
01:07:24,069 --> 01:07:24,079
like if you look at what carnegie did
 

3701
01:07:24,079 --> 01:07:25,589
like if you look at what carnegie did
the richest man in the world created

3702
01:07:25,589 --> 01:07:25,599
the richest man in the world created
 

3703
01:07:25,599 --> 01:07:27,990
the richest man in the world created
libraries everywhere at the time and he

3704
01:07:27,990 --> 01:07:28,000
libraries everywhere at the time and he
 

3705
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,309
libraries everywhere at the time and he
gave away his entire fortune and now we

3706
01:07:30,309 --> 01:07:30,319
gave away his entire fortune and now we
 

3707
01:07:30,319 --> 01:07:32,710
gave away his entire fortune and now we
can give a better library to every six

3708
01:07:32,710 --> 01:07:32,720
can give a better library to every six
 

3709
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:35,589
can give a better library to every six
year old for nothing and so

3710
01:07:35,589 --> 01:07:35,599
year old for nothing and so
 

3711
01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:37,349
year old for nothing and so
what's the value of giving a million

3712
01:07:37,349 --> 01:07:37,359
what's the value of giving a million
 

3713
01:07:37,359 --> 01:07:39,109
what's the value of giving a million
books to a

3714
01:07:39,109 --> 01:07:39,119
books to a
 

3715

eight billion people
 

3717
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:43,349
eight billion people
right that's that's the explosion in

3718
01:07:43,349 --> 01:07:43,359
right that's that's the explosion in
 

3719
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:44,870
right that's that's the explosion in
prosperity that comes from digital

transformation

3722
01:07:46,390 --> 01:07:46,400
transformation
 

3723
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:49,109
transformation
and uh when we do it with maps

3724
01:07:49,109 --> 01:07:49,119
and uh when we do it with maps
 

3725
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:51,670
and uh when we do it with maps
you know i i transform the map i put it

3726
01:07:51,670 --> 01:07:51,680
you know i i transform the map i put it
 

3727
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:53,430
you know i i transform the map i put it
into a car you get in the car and the

3728
01:07:53,430 --> 01:07:53,440
into a car you get in the car and the
 

3729
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:55,589
into a car you get in the car and the
car drives you where you want to go with

3730
01:07:55,589 --> 01:07:55,599
car drives you where you want to go with
 

3731
01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:56,549
car drives you where you want to go with
the map

3732
01:07:56,549 --> 01:07:56,559
the map
 

3733
01:07:56,559 --> 01:07:59,270
the map
right and how much better is that than a

3734
01:07:59,270 --> 01:07:59,280
right and how much better is that than a
 

3735
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:01,829
right and how much better is that than a
rand mcnally atlas right here it's like

3736
01:08:01,829 --> 01:08:01,839
rand mcnally atlas right here it's like
 

3737
01:08:01,839 --> 01:08:03,750
rand mcnally atlas right here it's like
it's like a million times better

3738
01:08:03,750 --> 01:08:03,760
it's like a million times better
 

3739
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:04,470
it's like a million times better
so

3740
01:08:04,470 --> 01:08:04,480
so
 

3741
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:08,390
so
the first wave of digital transformation

3742
01:08:08,390 --> 01:08:08,400
the first wave of digital transformation
 

3743
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:10,390
the first wave of digital transformation
was the dematerialization

3744
01:08:10,390 --> 01:08:10,400
was the dematerialization
 

3745
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:13,349
was the dematerialization
of all of these informational things

3746
01:08:13,349 --> 01:08:13,359
of all of these informational things
 

3747
01:08:13,359 --> 01:08:15,510
of all of these informational things
which are non-conservative that is you

3748
01:08:15,510 --> 01:08:15,520
which are non-conservative that is you
 

3749
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:16,870
which are non-conservative that is you

i give you 11 cents worth of electricity
and you don't have to

4282
01:18:04,390 --> 01:18:04,400
and you don't have to
 

4283
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:07,830
and you don't have to
row uh you know row a boat eight hours a

it would be a lot better you know that

4288
01:18:11,990 --> 01:18:12,000
it would be a lot better you know that
 

4289
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,390
it would be a lot better you know that
you would pay for your food in the first

4290
01:18:14,390 --> 01:18:14,400
you would pay for your food in the first
 

4291
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:16,229
you would pay for your food in the first
eight seconds of your day and then you

4292
01:18:16,229 --> 01:18:16,239
eight seconds of your day and then you
 

4293
01:18:16,239 --> 01:18:17,750
eight seconds of your day and then you
could start thinking about other things

4294
01:18:17,750 --> 01:18:17,760
could start thinking about other things
 

4295
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:18,550
could start thinking about other things
right

4296
01:18:18,550 --> 01:18:18,560
right
 

4297
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:19,669
right
um

4298
01:18:19,669 --> 01:18:19,679
um

um
with regard to

4300
01:18:21,590 --> 01:18:21,600
with regard to
 

4301
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:23,669
with regard to
technology you know

4302
01:18:23,669 --> 01:18:23,679
technology you know
 

4303
01:18:23,679 --> 01:18:25,350
technology you know
one thing that i learned studying

4304
01:18:25,350 --> 01:18:25,360
one thing that i learned studying
 

4305
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:28,950
one thing that i learned studying
technology when you look at s-curves is

4306
01:18:28,950 --> 01:18:28,960
technology when you look at s-curves is
 

4307
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:31,830
technology when you look at s-curves is
until you start the s-curve

4308
01:18:31,830 --> 01:18:31,840
until you start the s-curve
 

4309
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:34,630
until you start the s-curve
you don't know whether you're a hundred

4310
01:18:34,630 --> 01:18:34,640
you don't know whether you're a hundred
 

4311
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:36,870
you don't know whether you're a hundred
years from viability

4312
01:18:36,870 --> 01:18:36,880
years from viability
 

4313
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:39,830
years from viability
a thousand years from viability or a few

4314
01:18:39,830 --> 01:18:39,840
a thousand years from viability or a few
 

4315
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:41,669
a thousand years from viability or a few
months from viability

4316
01:18:41,669 --> 01:18:41,679
months from viability
 

4317
01:18:41,679 --> 01:18:42,870
months from viability
so

4318
01:18:42,870 --> 01:18:42,880
so
 

4319
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:45,350
so
isn't that fun that's so fun

4320
01:18:45,350 --> 01:18:45,360
isn't that fun that's so fun
 

4321
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:47,430
isn't that fun that's so fun
the the early part of the s curve is so

4322
01:18:47,430 --> 01:18:47,440
the the early part of the s curve is so
 

4323
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:48,870
the the early part of the s curve is so
fun

4324
01:18:48,870 --> 01:18:48,880
fun
 

4325
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:51,430
fun
because you don't know in 1900 you could

4326
01:18:51,430 --> 01:18:51,440
because you don't know in 1900 you could
 

4327
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:54,709
because you don't know in 1900 you could
have got any number of learned academics

01:18:54,709 --> 01:18:54,719
have got any number of learned academics
 

4329
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:56,950
have got any number of learned academics
to give you 10 000 reasons why humans

4330
01:18:56,950 --> 01:18:56,960
to give you 10 000 reasons why humans
 

4331
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:59,830
to give you 10 000 reasons why humans
will never fly yeah right and in 1903

4332
01:18:59,830 --> 01:18:59,840
will never fly yeah right and in 1903
 

4333

will never fly yeah right and in 1903
the wright brothers flew and by 1969

4334
01:19:02,310 --> 01:19:02,320
the wright brothers flew and by 1969
 

4335

the wright brothers flew and by 1969
we're walking on the moon so

4336
01:19:04,709 --> 01:19:04,719
we're walking on the moon so
 

4337
01:19:04,719 --> 01:19:08,149
we're walking on the moon so
the advance that we made in that field

4338
01:19:08,149 --> 01:19:08,159
the advance that we made in that field
 

4339
01:19:08,159 --> 01:19:10,630
the advance that we made in that field
was extraordinary but for the hundred

4340
01:19:10,630 --> 01:19:10,640
was extraordinary but for the hundred
 

4341
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:12,709
was extraordinary but for the hundred
years and 200 years before they were

4342
01:19:12,709 --> 01:19:12,719
years and 200 years before they were
 

4343
01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:15,430
years and 200 years before they were
just back and forth and nobody was close

4344
01:19:15,430 --> 01:19:15,440
just back and forth and nobody was close
 

4345
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:16,870
just back and forth and nobody was close
and um

4346
01:19:16,870 --> 01:19:16,880
and um
 

4347
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:19,350
and um
and that's the the happy part the happy

4348
01:19:19,350 --> 01:19:19,360
and that's the the happy part the happy
 

4349
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:21,189
and that's the the happy part the happy
part is we went from

4350
01:19:21,189 --> 01:19:21,199
part is we went from
 

4351
01:19:21,199 --> 01:19:23,590
part is we went from
flying 20 miles an hour or whatever to

4352
01:19:23,590 --> 01:19:23,600
flying 20 miles an hour or whatever to
 

4353

the unhappy part
 

4361
01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:33,830
the unhappy part
is i studied aeronautical engineering at

mit in the 80s
 

4365
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:37,750
mit in the 80s
and in the 80s we had

4366
01:19:37,750 --> 01:19:37,760
and in the 80s we had
 

4367
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:41,270
and in the 80s we had
gulf stream aircraft we had boeing 737s

4368
01:19:41,270 --> 01:19:41,280
gulf stream aircraft we had boeing 737s
 

4369
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:43,030
gulf stream aircraft we had boeing 737s
we had the space shuttle

4370
01:19:43,030 --> 01:19:43,040
we had the space shuttle
 

4371
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:45,830
we had the space shuttle
and you fast forward 40 years

4372
01:19:45,830 --> 01:19:45,840
and you fast forward 40 years
 

4373
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:48,070
and you fast forward 40 years
and we pretty much had the same exact

4374
01:19:48,070 --> 01:19:48,080
and we pretty much had the same exact
 

4375
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:50,470
and we pretty much had the same exact
aircraft this you know that the

4376
01:19:50,470 --> 01:19:50,480
aircraft this you know that the
 

4377
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:53,350
aircraft this you know that the
efficiency of the engines was

4378
01:19:53,350 --> 01:19:53,360
efficiency of the engines was
 

4379
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:56,790
efficiency of the engines was
20 30 percent more yeah right with we

4380
01:19:56,790 --> 01:19:56,800
20 30 percent more yeah right with we
 

4381

like in fact uh you know the global
express the gulf stream these are all

4388
01:20:07,590 --> 01:20:07,600
express the gulf stream these are all
 

4389
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:11,590
express the gulf stream these are all
engineered in the 70s some in the 60s

stream of a g5 was the same shape as a

4396
01:20:18,629 --> 01:20:18,639
stream of a g5 was the same shape as a
 

4397
01:20:18,639 --> 01:20:21,030
stream of a g5 was the same shape as a
g4 is the same shape as a g3 is the same

4398
01:20:21,030 --> 01:20:21,040
g4 is the same shape as a g3 is the same
 

4399
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:23,430
g4 is the same shape as a g3 is the same
shape as a g2 and that's because they

4400
01:20:23,430 --> 01:20:23,440
shape as a g2 and that's because they
 

4401
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:25,590
shape as a g2 and that's because they

you can create without aluminum
 

4471
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:36,390
you can create without aluminum
i think

4472
01:21:36,390 --> 01:21:36,400
i think
 

4473
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:38,550
i think
nothing right so that's a material so

4474
01:21:38,550 --> 01:21:38,560
nothing right so that's a material so
 

4475
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:40,830
nothing right so that's a material so
it's a materials problem okay so

4476
01:21:40,830 --> 01:21:40,840
it's a materials problem okay so
 

4477
01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:44,070
it's a materials problem okay so
1900 we we made massive advances in

4478
01:21:44,070 --> 01:21:44,080
1900 we we made massive advances in
 

4479
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:45,910
1900 we we made massive advances in
metallurgy right i mean that was that

4480
01:21:45,910 --> 01:21:45,920
metallurgy right i mean that was that
 

4481
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:49,030
metallurgy right i mean that was that
was u.s steel that was iron to steel

4482
01:21:49,030 --> 01:21:49,040
was u.s steel that was iron to steel
 

4483
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:50,229
was u.s steel that was iron to steel
aluminum

massive fortunes were created because

4486
01:21:52,070 --> 01:21:52,080
massive fortunes were created because
 

4487
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:54,470
massive fortunes were created because
this was a massive technical advance and

4488
01:21:54,470 --> 01:21:54,480
this was a massive technical advance and
 

4489
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:56,709
this was a massive technical advance and
then we also had the internal combustion

4490
01:21:56,709 --> 01:21:56,719
then we also had the internal combustion
 

4491
01:21:56,719 --> 01:21:59,030
then we also had the internal combustion
engine and you know the story of ford

4492
01:21:59,030 --> 01:21:59,040
engine and you know the story of ford
 

4493
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:01,510
engine and you know the story of ford
and general motors and daimler chrysler

4494
01:22:01,510 --> 01:22:01,520
and general motors and daimler chrysler
 

4495
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:04,390
and general motors and daimler chrysler
and the like is informed by that

4496
01:22:04,390 --> 01:22:04,400
and the like is informed by that
 

4497
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:06,709
and the like is informed by that
so you have no jet engines no rocket

4498
01:22:06,709 --> 01:22:06,719
so you have no jet engines no rocket
 

4499
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:08,629
so you have no jet engines no rocket
motors no internal combustion engines

4500
01:22:08,629 --> 01:22:08,639
motors no internal combustion engines
 

4501
01:22:08,639 --> 01:22:10,390
motors no internal combustion engines
you have no aviation

4502
01:22:10,390 --> 01:22:10,400
you have no aviation
 

4503
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:12,629
you have no aviation
but even if you had those engines if you

4504
01:22:12,629 --> 01:22:12,639
but even if you had those engines if you
 

4505
01:22:12,639 --> 01:22:13,910
but even if you had those engines if you
were trying to build those things with

4506
01:22:13,910 --> 01:22:13,920
were trying to build those things with
 

4507
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:15,189
were trying to build those things with
steel

4508
01:22:15,189 --> 01:22:15,199
steel
 

4509
01:22:15,199 --> 01:22:17,669
steel
no chance you had to have aluminum so

4510
01:22:17,669 --> 01:22:17,679
no chance you had to have aluminum so
 

4511
01:22:17,679 --> 01:22:18,709
no chance you had to have aluminum so
there's like

4512
01:22:18,709 --> 01:22:18,719
there's like
 

4513
01:22:18,719 --> 01:22:20,070
there's like
two

4514
01:22:20,070 --> 01:22:20,080
two
 

4515
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:23,350
two
pretty basic technologies and once you

4516
01:22:23,350 --> 01:22:23,360
pretty basic technologies and once you
 

4517
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:25,750
pretty basic technologies and once you
have those two technologies stuff

4518
01:22:25,750 --> 01:22:25,760
have those two technologies stuff
 

4519
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:27,510
have those two technologies stuff
happens very fast

4520
01:22:27,510 --> 01:22:27,520
happens very fast
 

4521
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:28,950
happens very fast
so

4522
01:22:28,950 --> 01:22:28,960
so
 

4523
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:30,310
so
tell me the the

4524
01:22:30,310 --> 01:22:30,320
tell me the the
 

4525
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:34,149
tell me the the
the last big advance in like jet engines

4526
01:22:34,149 --> 01:22:34,159
the last big advance in like jet engines
 

4527
01:22:34,159 --> 01:22:36,470
the last big advance in like jet engines
there hasn't been one

4528
01:22:36,470 --> 01:22:36,480
there hasn't been one
 

4529
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:38,390
there hasn't been one
like there had the last big advance in

4530
01:22:38,390 --> 01:22:38,400
like there had the last big advance in
 

4531
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:40,550
like there had the last big advance in
rocket engines how's it been one the big

4532
01:22:40,550 --> 01:22:40,560
rocket engines how's it been one the big
 

4533
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:43,270
rocket engines how's it been one the big
advances in spaceship design from what i

4534
01:22:43,270 --> 01:22:43,280
advances in spaceship design from what i
 

4535
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:45,669
advances in spaceship design from what i
can see are in the control systems the

4536
01:22:45,669 --> 01:22:45,679
can see are in the control systems the
 

4537
01:22:45,679 --> 01:22:48,870
can see are in the control systems the
the gyros and the ability to land

4538
01:22:48,870 --> 01:22:48,880
the gyros and the ability to land
 

4539
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:51,350
the gyros and the ability to land
right in a stable fashion that's pretty

4540
01:22:51,350 --> 01:22:51,360
right in a stable fashion that's pretty
 

4541
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:55,270
right in a stable fashion that's pretty
amazing landing a rocket also in the um

4542
01:22:55,270 --> 01:22:55,280
amazing landing a rocket also in the um
 

4543
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:57,110
amazing landing a rocket also in the um
at least according to

4544
01:22:57,110 --> 01:22:57,120
at least according to
 

4545
01:22:57,120 --> 01:23:00,950
at least according to
the elon and so on the manufacturer of

4546
01:23:00,950 --> 01:23:00,960
the elon and so on the manufacturer of
 

4547
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:01,669
the elon and so on the manufacturer of
the

4548
01:23:01,669 --> 01:23:01,679
the
 

4549
01:23:01,679 --> 01:23:04,550
the
more efficient and less expensive

4550
01:23:04,550 --> 01:23:04,560
more efficient and less expensive
 

4551
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:06,470
more efficient and less expensive
manufacturer of rockets

4552
01:23:06,470 --> 01:23:06,480
manufacturer of rockets
 

4553
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:08,229
manufacturer of rockets
so like it's a production whatever that

4554
01:23:08,229 --> 01:23:08,239
so like it's a production whatever that
 

4555
01:23:08,239 --> 01:23:10,310
so like it's a production whatever that
you call that discipline of

4556
01:23:10,310 --> 01:23:10,320
you call that discipline of
 

4557
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:12,229
you call that discipline of
at scale manufacture at scale production

4558
01:23:12,229 --> 01:23:12,239
at scale manufacture at scale production
 

4559
01:23:12,239 --> 01:23:15,350
at scale manufacture at scale production
so factory work but it's not 10x

4560
01:23:15,350 --> 01:23:15,360
so factory work but it's not 10x
 

4561
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:17,669
so factory work but it's not 10x
i mean maybe it's 10x over a period of a

4562
01:23:17,669 --> 01:23:17,679
i mean maybe it's 10x over a period of a
 

4563
01:23:17,679 --> 01:23:20,470
i mean maybe it's 10x over a period of a
few decades when we figure out how to

4564
01:23:20,470 --> 01:23:20,480
few decades when we figure out how to
 

4565
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:21,990
few decades when we figure out how to
operate a

4566
01:23:21,990 --> 01:23:22,000
operate a
 

4567
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,550
operate a
spaceship you know on the water in your

4568
01:23:24,550 --> 01:23:24,560
spaceship you know on the water in your
 

4569
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:26,870
spaceship you know on the water in your
water bottle for a year

4570
01:23:26,870 --> 01:23:26,880
water bottle for a year
 

4571
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:28,470
water bottle for a year
yeah right now then you've got a

4572
01:23:28,470 --> 01:23:28,480
yeah right now then you've got a
 

4573
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:30,310
yeah right now then you've got a
breakthrough so the bottom line is

4574
01:23:30,310 --> 01:23:30,320
breakthrough so the bottom line is
 

4575
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:31,590
breakthrough so the bottom line is
propulsion

4576
01:23:31,590 --> 01:23:31,600
propulsion
 

4577
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:34,629
propulsion
propel propulsion technology uh

4578
01:23:34,629 --> 01:23:34,639
propel propulsion technology uh
 

4579
01:23:34,639 --> 01:23:37,669
propel propulsion technology uh
propellants and the materials technology

4580
01:23:37,669 --> 01:23:37,679
propellants and the materials technology
 

4581
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:39,350
propellants and the materials technology
they were critical to getting on that

4582
01:23:39,350 --> 01:23:39,360
they were critical to getting on that
 

4583
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:41,669
they were critical to getting on that
aviation s-curve and then we slammed

4584
01:23:41,669 --> 01:23:41,679
aviation s-curve and then we slammed
 

4585
01:23:41,679 --> 01:23:43,110
aviation s-curve and then we slammed
into a wall

4586
01:23:43,110 --> 01:23:43,120
into a wall
 

4587
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:44,550
into a wall
in the 70s

4588
01:23:44,550 --> 01:23:44,560
in the 70s
 

4589
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:47,270
in the 70s
and the boeing 747

4590
01:23:47,270 --> 01:23:47,280
and the boeing 747
 

4591
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:50,229
and the boeing 747
the global express the gulf stream these

4592
01:23:50,229 --> 01:23:50,239
the global express the gulf stream these
 

4593
01:23:50,239 --> 01:23:52,470
the global express the gulf stream these
things were the space shuttle

4594
01:23:52,470 --> 01:23:52,480
things were the space shuttle
 

4595
01:23:52,480 --> 01:23:54,229
things were the space shuttle
they were all pretty much reflective of

4596
01:23:54,229 --> 01:23:54,239
they were all pretty much reflective of
 

4597
01:23:54,239 --> 01:23:55,669
they were all pretty much reflective of
that and then we kind of

4598
01:23:55,669 --> 01:23:55,679
that and then we kind of
 

4599
01:23:55,679 --> 01:23:57,430
that and then we kind of
then we stopped and at that point you

4600
01:23:57,430 --> 01:23:57,440
then we stopped and at that point you
 

4601
01:23:57,440 --> 01:23:59,990
then we stopped and at that point you
have to switch to a new s curve so

4602
01:23:59,990 --> 01:24:00,000
have to switch to a new s curve so
 

4603
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,350
have to switch to a new s curve so
the next

4604
01:24:01,350 --> 01:24:01,360
the next
 

4605
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:03,270
the next
equivalent to the internal combustion

4606
01:24:03,270 --> 01:24:03,280
equivalent to the internal combustion
 

4607
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:06,550
equivalent to the internal combustion
engine was the cpu and the next aluminum

4608
01:24:06,550 --> 01:24:06,560
engine was the cpu and the next aluminum
 

4609
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:08,870
engine was the cpu and the next aluminum
equipment was silicon so when we

4610
01:24:08,870 --> 01:24:08,880
equipment was silicon so when we
 

4611
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:11,430
equipment was silicon so when we
actually started developing cpus

4612
01:24:11,430 --> 01:24:11,440
actually started developing cpus
 

4613
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:14,149
actually started developing cpus
transistor gateway to cpus and if you

4614
01:24:14,149 --> 01:24:14,159
transistor gateway to cpus and if you
 

4615
01:24:14,159 --> 01:24:15,350
transistor gateway to cpus and if you
look at the

4616
01:24:15,350 --> 01:24:15,360
look at the
 

4617
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:16,790
look at the
the power

4618
01:24:16,790 --> 01:24:16,800
the power
 

4619
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:18,550
the power
right the bandwidth that we had on

4620
01:24:18,550 --> 01:24:18,560
right the bandwidth that we had on
 

4621
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:21,030
right the bandwidth that we had on
computers and moore's law right

4622
01:24:21,030 --> 01:24:21,040
computers and moore's law right
 

4623
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:23,990
computers and moore's law right
what if the efficiency of jet engines

4624
01:24:23,990 --> 01:24:24,000
what if the efficiency of jet engines
 

4625
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,830
what if the efficiency of jet engines
had doubled

4626
01:24:25,830 --> 01:24:25,840
had doubled
 

4627
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:28,229
had doubled
every three years

4628
01:24:28,229 --> 01:24:28,239
every three years
 

4629
01:24:28,239 --> 01:24:29,910
every three years
right in the last 40 years where we be

4630
01:24:29,910 --> 01:24:29,920
right in the last 40 years where we be
 

4631
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:31,110
right in the last 40 years where we be
right now right

4632
01:24:31,110 --> 01:24:31,120
right now right
 

4633
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:32,310
right now right
so

4634
01:24:32,310 --> 01:24:32,320
so
 

4635
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:34,870
so
so i i think that if you're if you're a

4636
01:24:34,870 --> 01:24:34,880
so i i think that if you're if you're a
 

4637
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:36,709
so i i think that if you're if you're a
business person if you're looking for

4638
01:24:36,709 --> 01:24:36,719
business person if you're looking for
 

4639
01:24:36,719 --> 01:24:39,110
business person if you're looking for
commercially viable

4640
01:24:39,110 --> 01:24:39,120
commercially viable
 

4641
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:42,229
commercially viable
application of your mind

4642
01:24:42,229 --> 01:24:42,239
application of your mind
 

4643
01:24:42,239 --> 01:24:44,550
application of your mind
then you have to find that s-curve and

4644
01:24:44,550 --> 01:24:44,560
then you have to find that s-curve and
 

4645
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:46,470
then you have to find that s-curve and
ideally

4646
01:24:46,470 --> 01:24:46,480
ideally
 

4647
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:48,310
ideally
you you have to find it in the first

4648
01:24:48,310 --> 01:24:48,320
you you have to find it in the first
 

4649
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:50,709
you you have to find it in the first
five six ten years

4650
01:24:50,709 --> 01:24:50,719
five six ten years
 

4651
01:24:50,719 --> 01:24:53,189
five six ten years
but people always miss this let's take

4652
01:24:53,189 --> 01:24:53,199
but people always miss this let's take
 

4653
01:24:53,199 --> 01:24:55,110
but people always miss this let's take
google glass

4654
01:24:55,110 --> 01:24:55,120
google glass
 

4655
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:58,470
google glass
right google glass was a idea 2013

4656
01:24:58,470 --> 01:24:58,480
right google glass was a idea 2013
 

4657
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:00,629
right google glass was a idea 2013
the year is 2022

4658
01:25:00,629 --> 01:25:00,639
the year is 2022
 

4659
01:25:00,639 --> 01:25:02,470
the year is 2022
and people were quite sure this was

4660
01:25:02,470 --> 01:25:02,480
and people were quite sure this was
 

4661
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:04,149
and people were quite sure this was
going to be a big thing but it could

4662
01:25:04,149 --> 01:25:04,159
going to be a big thing but it could
 

4663
01:25:04,159 --> 01:25:05,110
going to be a big thing but it could
have been

4664
01:25:05,110 --> 01:25:05,120
have been
 

4665
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:07,030
have been
at the at the beginning of the s curve

4666
01:25:07,030 --> 01:25:07,040
at the at the beginning of the s curve
 

4667
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:08,550
at the at the beginning of the s curve
but fundamentally

4668
01:25:08,550 --> 01:25:08,560
but fundamentally
 

4669
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:11,030
but fundamentally
we didn't really have an effective

4670
01:25:11,030 --> 01:25:11,040
we didn't really have an effective
 

4671
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:13,590
we didn't really have an effective
mechanism i mean people getting vertigo

4672
01:25:13,590 --> 01:25:13,600
mechanism i mean people getting vertigo
 

4673
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:14,790
mechanism i mean people getting vertigo
and they're yeah but you didn't know

4674
01:25:14,790 --> 01:25:14,800
and they're yeah but you didn't know
 

4675
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:17,030
and they're yeah but you didn't know
that at the beginning of this

4676
01:25:17,030 --> 01:25:17,040
that at the beginning of this
 

4677
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:18,870
that at the beginning of this
right i mean maybe some people had a

4678
01:25:18,870 --> 01:25:18,880
right i mean maybe some people had a
 

4679
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:21,350
right i mean maybe some people had a
deep intuition about the fundamentals of

4680
01:25:21,350 --> 01:25:21,360
deep intuition about the fundamentals of
 

4681
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:23,750
deep intuition about the fundamentals of
augmented reality but you don't know

4682
01:25:23,750 --> 01:25:23,760
augmented reality but you don't know
 

4683
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:26,310
augmented reality but you don't know
that you don't have those uh you're

4684
01:25:26,310 --> 01:25:26,320
that you don't have those uh you're
 

4685
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:28,070
that you don't have those uh you're
looking through the fog you don't know

4686
01:25:28,070 --> 01:25:28,080
looking through the fog you don't know
 

4687
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:31,990
looking through the fog you don't know
so the point is we're year zero in 2013

4688
01:25:31,990 --> 01:25:32,000
so the point is we're year zero in 2013
 

4689
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,950
so the point is we're year zero in 2013
and we're still year zero in 2022 on

4690
01:25:34,950 --> 01:25:34,960
and we're still year zero in 2022 on
 

4691
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:37,910
and we're still year zero in 2022 on
that augmented reality and when somebody

4692
01:25:37,910 --> 01:25:37,920
that augmented reality and when somebody
 

4693
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:40,390
that augmented reality and when somebody
puts out a set of glasses

4694
01:25:40,390 --> 01:25:40,400
puts out a set of glasses
 

4695
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:43,030
puts out a set of glasses
that you can wear comfortably without

4696
01:25:43,030 --> 01:25:43,040
that you can wear comfortably without
 

4697
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:44,709
that you can wear comfortably without
getting vertigo

4698
01:25:44,709 --> 01:25:44,719
getting vertigo
 

4699
01:25:44,719 --> 01:25:45,830
getting vertigo
right

4700
01:25:45,830 --> 01:25:45,840
right
 

4701
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:48,550
right
without any disorientation that managed

4702
01:25:48,550 --> 01:25:48,560
without any disorientation that managed
 

4703
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:50,790
without any disorientation that managed
to have the stability and the bandwidth

4704
01:25:50,790 --> 01:25:50,800
to have the stability and the bandwidth
 

4705
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:52,550
to have the stability and the bandwidth
necessary to sync

4706
01:25:52,550 --> 01:25:52,560
necessary to sync
 

4707
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:54,229
necessary to sync
with the real world you'll be in year

4708
01:25:54,229 --> 01:25:54,239
with the real world you'll be in year
 

4709
01:25:54,239 --> 01:25:55,430
with the real world you'll be in year
one

4710
01:25:55,430 --> 01:25:55,440
one
 

4711
01:25:55,440 --> 01:25:57,430
one
and and from that point you'll have a

4712
01:25:57,430 --> 01:25:57,440
and and from that point you'll have a
 

4713
01:25:57,440 --> 01:26:00,950
and and from that point you'll have a
70-year or some some interesting future

4714
01:26:00,950 --> 01:26:00,960
70-year or some some interesting future
 

4715
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:03,590
70-year or some some interesting future
until you slam into a limit to growth

4716
01:26:03,590 --> 01:26:03,600
until you slam into a limit to growth
 

4717
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:04,390
until you slam into a limit to growth
yeah

4718
01:26:04,390 --> 01:26:04,400
yeah
 

4719
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:06,310
yeah
and then it'll slow down

4720
01:26:06,310 --> 01:26:06,320
and then it'll slow down
 

4721
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:07,430
and then it'll slow down
and

4722
01:26:07,430 --> 01:26:07,440
and
 

4723
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:08,470
and
this

4724
01:26:08,470 --> 01:26:08,480
this
 

4725
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:10,149
this
this is the story of a lot of things

4726

this is the story of a lot of things
right i mean john d rockefeller got in

4728
01:26:12,149 --> 01:26:12,159
right i mean john d rockefeller got in
 

4729
01:26:12,159 --> 01:26:15,750
right i mean john d rockefeller got in
the oil business in the 1860s

4730
01:26:15,750 --> 01:26:15,760
the oil business in the 1860s
 

4731
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:18,950
the oil business in the 1860s
and the oil business as we understood it

4732
01:26:18,950 --> 01:26:18,960
and the oil business as we understood it
 

4733
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:22,149
and the oil business as we understood it
you know became fairly mature you know

4734
01:26:22,149 --> 01:26:22,159
you know became fairly mature you know
 

4735
01:26:22,159 --> 01:26:23,110
you know became fairly mature you know
by

4736
01:26:23,110 --> 01:26:23,120
by
 

4737
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:26,070
by
the 1920s the 30s and then it actually

4738
01:26:26,070 --> 01:26:26,080
the 1920s the 30s and then it actually
 

4739
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:28,229
the 1920s the 30s and then it actually
stayed that way until we got to fracking

4740
01:26:28,229 --> 01:26:28,239
stayed that way until we got to fracking
 

4741
01:26:28,239 --> 01:26:30,390
stayed that way until we got to fracking
and like which was like 70 years later

4742
01:26:30,390 --> 01:26:30,400
and like which was like 70 years later
 

4743
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:32,550
and like which was like 70 years later
and then it burst forward

4744
01:26:32,550 --> 01:26:32,560
and then it burst forward
 

4745
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:34,470
and then it burst forward
so the interesting story about moore's

4746
01:26:34,470 --> 01:26:34,480
so the interesting story about moore's
 

4747
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:37,110
so the interesting story about moore's
law though is that you get this like

4748
01:26:37,110 --> 01:26:37,120
law though is that you get this like
 

4749
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:40,149
law though is that you get this like
constant burst of s s curves on top of

01:26:40,149 --> 01:26:40,159
constant burst of s s curves on top of
 

4751
01:26:40,159 --> 01:26:42,149
constant burst of s s curves on top of
eskers on top of esker it's like the

4752
01:26:42,149 --> 01:26:42,159
eskers on top of esker it's like the
 

4753
01:26:42,159 --> 01:26:44,629
eskers on top of esker it's like the
moment you start slowing down

4754
01:26:44,629 --> 01:26:44,639
moment you start slowing down
 

4755
01:26:44,639 --> 01:26:47,350
moment you start slowing down
or almost ahead of you slowing down you

4756
01:26:47,350 --> 01:26:47,360

4757
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:49,350

4759
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:51,510
come up with another innovation another
innovation so moore's law doesn't seem

4760
01:26:51,510 --> 01:26:51,520
innovation so moore's law doesn't seem
 

4761
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:53,350

a dematerialized map
 

4889
01:29:08,159 --> 01:29:11,350
a dematerialized map
right it becomes a map because

4890
01:29:11,350 --> 01:29:11,360
right it becomes a map because
 

4891
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:14,070
right it becomes a map because
i can put it on a display like an ipad

4892
01:29:14,070 --> 01:29:14,080
i can put it on a display like an ipad
 

4893
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:17,270
i can put it on a display like an ipad
or i can put it in a car like a tesla

4894
01:29:17,270 --> 01:29:17,280
or i can put it in a car like a tesla
 

4895
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:18,310
or i can put it in a car like a tesla
but

4896
01:29:18,310 --> 01:29:18,320
but
 

4897
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:20,149
but
if you really want to figure it out you

4898
01:29:20,149 --> 01:29:20,159
if you really want to figure it out you
 

4899
01:29:20,159 --> 01:29:21,750
if you really want to figure it out you
can't think like an engineer you need to

4900
01:29:21,750 --> 01:29:21,760
can't think like an engineer you need to
 

4901
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:24,709
can't think like an engineer you need to
think like a fantasy writer like this is

4902
01:29:24,709 --> 01:29:24,719
think like a fantasy writer like this is
 

4903
01:29:24,719 --> 01:29:27,030
think like a fantasy writer like this is
where it's useful if you studied uh if

4904
01:29:27,030 --> 01:29:27,040
where it's useful if you studied uh if
 

4905
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:28,870
where it's useful if you studied uh if
you read played dungeons and dragons and

4906
01:29:28,870 --> 01:29:28,880
you read played dungeons and dragons and
 

4907
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:31,189
you read played dungeons and dragons and
you read lord of the rings and you

4908
01:29:31,189 --> 01:29:31,199
you read lord of the rings and you
 

4909
01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:32,870
you read lord of the rings and you
you study all the fantasy literature

4910
01:29:32,870 --> 01:29:32,880
you study all the fantasy literature
 

4911
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:34,390
you study all the fantasy literature
because

4912
01:29:34,390 --> 01:29:34,400
because
 

4913
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:38,070
because
because when i dematerialize the map

4914
01:29:38,070 --> 01:29:38,080
because when i dematerialize the map
 

4915
01:29:38,080 --> 01:29:40,470
because when i dematerialize the map
first i put 10 million pages of

4916
01:29:40,470 --> 01:29:40,480
first i put 10 million pages of
 

4917
01:29:40,480 --> 01:29:42,390
first i put 10 million pages of
satellite imagery into

4918
01:29:42,390 --> 01:29:42,400
satellite imagery into
 

4919
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:45,030
satellite imagery into
the map right that's a simple physical

4920
01:29:45,030 --> 01:29:45,040
the map right that's a simple physical
 

4921
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:47,110
the map right that's a simple physical
transform

4922

transform
 

4923
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:50,310
transform
but then i start to put telemetry into

4924
01:29:50,310 --> 01:29:50,320
but then i start to put telemetry into
 

4925
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:52,310
but then i start to put telemetry into
the map and i keep track of the traffic

4926
01:29:52,310 --> 01:29:52,320
the map and i keep track of the traffic
 

4927
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:54,229
the map and i keep track of the traffic
rates on the roads and i tell you

4928
01:29:54,229 --> 01:29:54,239
rates on the roads and i tell you
 

4929
01:29:54,239 --> 01:29:55,590
rates on the roads and i tell you
whether you'll be in a traffic jam if

4930
01:29:55,590 --> 01:29:55,600
whether you'll be in a traffic jam if
 

4931
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:56,870
whether you'll be in a traffic jam if
you drive that way and i tell you which

4932
01:29:56,870 --> 01:29:56,880
you drive that way and i tell you which
 

4933
01:29:56,880 --> 01:29:58,070
you drive that way and i tell you which
way to drive

4934
01:29:58,070 --> 01:29:58,080
way to drive
 

4935
01:29:58,080 --> 01:29:59,830
way to drive
and then i start to get feedback on

4936
01:29:59,830 --> 01:29:59,840
and then i start to get feedback on
 

4937
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:01,110
and then i start to get feedback on
where you're going and i tell you the

4938
01:30:01,110 --> 01:30:01,120
where you're going and i tell you the
 

4939
01:30:01,120 --> 01:30:02,550
where you're going and i tell you the
restaurant's closed and people don't

4940
01:30:02,550 --> 01:30:02,560
restaurant's closed and people don't
 

4941
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:04,709
restaurant's closed and people don't
like it anyway

4942
01:30:04,709 --> 01:30:04,719
like it anyway
 

4943
01:30:04,719 --> 01:30:06,870

and then i put an ai on top of it and i

4944
01:30:06,870 --> 01:30:06,880
and then i put an ai on top of it and i
 

4945
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:09,189
and then i put an ai on top of it and i
have it drive your car for you

4946
01:30:09,189 --> 01:30:09,199
have it drive your car for you
 

4947
01:30:09,199 --> 01:30:11,189
have it drive your car for you
and eventually

4948
01:30:11,189 --> 01:30:11,199
and eventually
 

4949
01:30:11,199 --> 01:30:13,110

the implication of digital
 

4951
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:15,189
the implication of digital
transformation of maps is i get in a

4952
01:30:15,189 --> 01:30:15,199
transformation of maps is i get in a
 

4953
01:30:15,199 --> 01:30:17,110
transformation of maps is i get in a
self-driving car and i say take me

4954
01:30:17,110 --> 01:30:17,120
self-driving car and i say take me
 

4955
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:20,229
self-driving car and i say take me
someplace cool where i can eat

4956

someplace cool where i can eat
 

4957
01:30:20,239 --> 01:30:22,790

right and and how did you get to that

4958
01:30:22,790 --> 01:30:22,800
right and and how did you get to that
 

4959
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:26,149

don't you would say
you know it's not going to work till you

01:31:58,400 --> 01:32:00,629
you're not going to get to that until
you work out the calculus of variations

5048
01:32:00,629 --> 01:32:00,639
you work out the calculus of variations
 

5049
01:32:00,639 --> 01:32:02,870
you work out the calculus of variations
and some metallurgy and there's a dude

5050
01:32:02,870 --> 01:32:02,880
and some metallurgy and there's a dude
 

5051
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:05,110
and some metallurgy and there's a dude
newton that won't come along for quite a

5052
01:32:05,110 --> 01:32:05,120
newton that won't come along for quite a
 

5053
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:06,310
newton that won't come along for quite a
while and he's going to give you the

5054
01:32:06,310 --> 01:32:06,320
while and he's going to give you the
 

5055
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:08,390
while and he's going to give you the
calculus to do it and until then it's

5056
01:32:08,390 --> 01:32:08,400
calculus to do it and until then it's
 

5057
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:11,110
calculus to do it and until then it's
hopeless so you you might be better off

5058
01:32:11,110 --> 01:32:11,120
hopeless so you you might be better off
 

5059
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:14,470
hopeless so you you might be better off
to work on the aqueduct or to focus upon

5060
01:32:14,470 --> 01:32:14,480
to work on the aqueduct or to focus upon
 

5061
01:32:14,480 --> 01:32:17,430
to work on the aqueduct or to focus upon
sales or something so if if i look at

5062
01:32:17,430 --> 01:32:17,440
sales or something so if if i look at
 

5063
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:20,149
sales or something so if if i look at
this today i say

5064
01:32:20,149 --> 01:32:20,159
this today i say
 

5065
01:32:20,159 --> 01:32:22,870
this today i say
there's massive profound

5066
01:32:22,870 --> 01:32:22,880
there's massive profound
 

5067
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:25,189
there's massive profound
environment civilization advances to be

5068
01:32:25,189 --> 01:32:25,199
environment civilization advances to be
 

5069
01:32:25,199 --> 01:32:26,870
environment civilization advances to be
made through digital transformation of

5070
01:32:26,870 --> 01:32:26,880
made through digital transformation of
 

5071
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:28,790
made through digital transformation of
information and you can see them like

5072
01:32:28,790 --> 01:32:28,800
information and you can see them like
 

5073
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:30,550
information and you can see them like
that this is

5074
01:32:30,550 --> 01:32:30,560
that this is
 

5075
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:32,550
that this is
the story of today this is not the story

5076
01:32:32,550 --> 01:32:32,560
the story of today this is not the story
 

5077
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:34,870
the story of today this is not the story
of today right it's 10 years old what

5078
01:32:34,870 --> 01:32:34,880
of today right it's 10 years old what
 

5079
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:36,950
of today right it's 10 years old what
we've been seeing we're living through

5080
01:32:36,950 --> 01:32:36,960
we've been seeing we're living through
 

5081
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:38,550
we've been seeing we're living through
different manifestations of that story

5082
01:32:38,550 --> 01:32:38,560
different manifestations of that story
 

5083
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:41,590
different manifestations of that story
today too though like social media uh

5084
01:32:41,590 --> 01:32:41,600
today too though like social media uh
 

5085
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:42,310
today too though like social media uh
that

5086
01:32:42,310 --> 01:32:42,320
that
 

5087
01:32:42,320 --> 01:32:44,470
that
the effects of that is very interesting

5088
01:32:44,470 --> 01:32:44,480
the effects of that is very interesting
 

5089
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:46,870
the effects of that is very interesting
because ideas spread even you talk about

5090
01:32:46,870 --> 01:32:46,880
because ideas spread even you talk about
 

5091
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:50,310
because ideas spread even you talk about
velocity of money the velocity of ideas

5092
01:32:50,310 --> 01:32:50,320
velocity of money the velocity of ideas
 

5093
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:53,189
velocity of money the velocity of ideas
keeps increasing yeah so like wikipedia

5094
01:32:53,189 --> 01:32:53,199
keeps increasing yeah so like wikipedia
 

5095
01:32:53,199 --> 01:32:55,990
keeps increasing yeah so like wikipedia

it's like a
water hose or something it's like

5106
01:33:03,030 --> 01:33:03,040
water hose or something it's like
 

5107
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:04,709
water hose or something it's like
spraying you with knowledge whether you

5108
01:33:04,709 --> 01:33:04,719
spraying you with knowledge whether you
 

5109
01:33:04,719 --> 01:33:06,790
spraying you with knowledge whether you
want it or not it's like social media is

5110
01:33:06,790 --> 01:33:06,800
want it or not it's like social media is
 

5111
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:10,310
want it or not it's like social media is
just like this explosion of ideas and

5112
01:33:10,310 --> 01:33:10,320
just like this explosion of ideas and
 

5113
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:13,110
just like this explosion of ideas and
then we pick them up and then we try to

5114
01:33:13,110 --> 01:33:13,120
then we pick them up and then we try to
 

5115
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:14,950
then we pick them up and then we try to
understand ourselves because the drama

5116
01:33:14,950 --> 01:33:14,960
understand ourselves because the drama
 

5117
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:15,830
understand ourselves because the drama
of it

5118
01:33:15,830 --> 01:33:15,840
of it
 

5119
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:17,669
of it
also plays with our human psyche so

5120
01:33:17,669 --> 01:33:17,679
also plays with our human psyche so
 

5121
01:33:17,679 --> 01:33:20,149
also plays with our human psyche so
sometimes there's more

5122
01:33:20,149 --> 01:33:20,159
sometimes there's more
 

5123
01:33:20,159 --> 01:33:21,910
sometimes there's more
ability for misinformation for

5124
01:33:21,910 --> 01:33:21,920
ability for misinformation for
 

5125
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:23,750
ability for misinformation for
propaganda to take hold so we get to

5126
01:33:23,750 --> 01:33:23,760
propaganda to take hold so we get to
 

5127
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:25,669
propaganda to take hold so we get to
learn about ourselves we get to learn

5128
01:33:25,669 --> 01:33:25,679
learn about ourselves we get to learn
 

5129
01:33:25,679 --> 01:33:27,750
learn about ourselves we get to learn
about the technology they can decelerate

5130
01:33:27,750 --> 01:33:27,760
about the technology they can decelerate
 

5131
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:29,669
about the technology they can decelerate
their propaganda for example all that

5132
01:33:29,669 --> 01:33:29,679
their propaganda for example all that
 

5133
01:33:29,679 --> 01:33:31,669
their propaganda for example all that
kind of stuff but like the reality is

5134
01:33:31,669 --> 01:33:31,679
kind of stuff but like the reality is
 

5135
01:33:31,679 --> 01:33:33,110
kind of stuff but like the reality is
we're living i feel like we're living

understanding of exactly how it's
 

5145
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:43,750

monetary or a wealth increase is a way
 

5161
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:04,629
monetary or a wealth increase is a way
to increase the net energy in the

5167
01:34:09,120 --> 01:34:11,590
if we had 10 times as much of everything
we'd have a lot more

5168
01:34:11,590 --> 01:34:11,600
we'd have a lot more
 

5169
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:13,830
we'd have a lot more
free resources to pursue all of our

the question is do you need any profound

5202
01:34:48,390 --> 01:34:48,400
the question is do you need any profound
 

5203
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:50,629
the question is do you need any profound
uh breakthrough in materials or

5204
01:34:50,629 --> 01:34:50,639
uh breakthrough in materials or
 

5205
01:34:50,639 --> 01:34:53,669
uh breakthrough in materials or
technology to do that answers not really

01:37:38,070 --> 01:37:38,080
is much greater so how do you think
 

5359
01:37:38,080 --> 01:37:41,350
is much greater so how do you think
about the general energy what is it

about the general energy what is it
 

5361

so i i'll start with tesla

5362
01:37:43,910 --> 01:37:43,920
so i i'll start with tesla
 

5363
01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:45,669

says and you don't know what the code
 

5863
01:47:02,719 --> 01:47:05,270
says and you don't know what the code
says that's that makes it a security

5864
01:47:05,270 --> 01:47:05,280
says that's that makes it a security
 

5865
01:47:05,280 --> 01:47:07,030
says that's that makes it a security
if uh

5866
01:47:07,030 --> 01:47:07,040
if uh
 

5867
01:47:07,040 --> 01:47:09,590
if uh
if it's uh permissioned

5868
01:47:09,590 --> 01:47:09,600
if it's uh permissioned
 

5869
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:12,070
if it's uh permissioned
if you're not allowed on my network or

5870
01:47:12,070 --> 01:47:12,080
if you're not allowed on my network or
 

5871
01:47:12,080 --> 01:47:14,709
if you're not allowed on my network or
if you can be censored or booted off my

5872
01:47:14,709 --> 01:47:14,719
if you can be censored or booted off my
 

5873
01:47:14,719 --> 01:47:16,070
if you can be censored or booted off my
network

5874
01:47:16,070 --> 01:47:16,080
network
 

5875
01:47:16,080 --> 01:47:18,870
network
that also makes it a security

5876
01:47:18,870 --> 01:47:18,880
that also makes it a security
 

5877
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:19,990
that also makes it a security
um

5878
01:47:19,990 --> 01:47:20,000
um
 

5879
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:20,870
um
so

5880
01:47:20,870 --> 01:47:20,880
so
 

5881
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:24,709
so
so when i talk about uh property i mean

5882
01:47:24,709 --> 01:47:24,719
so when i talk about uh property i mean
 

5883
01:47:24,719 --> 01:47:26,629
so when i talk about uh property i mean
the challenge here is how do i create

5884
01:47:26,629 --> 01:47:26,639
the challenge here is how do i create
 

5885
01:47:26,639 --> 01:47:29,030
the challenge here is how do i create
something that's equivalent to a barrel

5886
01:47:29,030 --> 01:47:29,040
something that's equivalent to a barrel
 

5887
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:30,790
something that's equivalent to a barrel
of oil

5888
01:47:30,790 --> 01:47:30,800

01:47:32,709 --> 01:47:32,719
in cyberspace
 

5891
01:47:32,719 --> 01:47:34,950
in cyberspace
and that means it has to be a a

5892
01:47:34,950 --> 01:47:34,960
and that means it has to be a a
 

5893
01:47:34,960 --> 01:47:37,830
and that means it has to be a a
non-sovereign bearer instrument open

5894
01:47:37,830 --> 01:47:37,840
non-sovereign bearer instrument open
 

5895
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:41,510
non-sovereign bearer instrument open

permissionless not censorable
 

5897
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:43,030
permissionless not censorable
right

5898
01:47:43,030 --> 01:47:43,040
right
 

5899
01:47:43,040 --> 01:47:45,030
right
if i could do that

5900
01:47:45,030 --> 01:47:45,040
if i could do that
 

5901
01:47:45,040 --> 01:47:47,830
if i could do that
then i could deliver you ten thousand

5902
01:47:47,830 --> 01:47:47,840
then i could deliver you ten thousand
 

5903
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:50,550
then i could deliver you ten thousand
dematerialized barrels of oil

dematerialized barrels of oil
 

5905
01:47:50,560 --> 01:47:51,830
dematerialized barrels of oil
and you would take

5906
01:47:51,830 --> 01:47:51,840
and you would take
 

5907
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:53,750
and you would take
settlement of them

5908
01:47:53,750 --> 01:47:53,760
settlement of them
 

5909
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:55,750
settlement of them
and you would know that you have

5910
01:47:55,750 --> 01:47:55,760
and you would know that you have
 

5911
01:47:55,760 --> 01:47:58,870
and you would know that you have
possession of that property irregardless

01:48:07,750 --> 01:48:07,760
uh that that's uh a really critical
 

5919
01:48:07,760 --> 01:48:11,030
uh that that's uh a really critical
characteristic and and it actually is

01:48:11,030 --> 01:48:11,040
characteristic and and it actually is
 

5921
01:48:11,040 --> 01:48:13,430

it's probably one of the fundamental
 

5923
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:15,669
it's probably one of the fundamental
things that makes bitcoin special

5924
01:48:15,669 --> 01:48:15,679
things that makes bitcoin special

bitcoin isn't just a crypto asset
network it's easy to create a crypto

5928
01:48:19,030 --> 01:48:19,040
network it's easy to create a crypto
 

5929
01:48:19,040 --> 01:48:21,750
network it's easy to create a crypto
asset network it's very hard

5930
01:48:21,750 --> 01:48:21,760
asset network it's very hard
 

5931
01:48:21,760 --> 01:48:24,149
asset network it's very hard
uh to create an ethical

uh to create an ethical
 

5933
01:48:24,159 --> 01:48:27,189
uh to create an ethical
crypto asset network because

5934
01:48:27,189 --> 01:48:27,199
crypto asset network because
 

5935
01:48:27,199 --> 01:48:29,830
crypto asset network because
you ha you have to create one

5936
01:48:29,830 --> 01:48:29,840
you ha you have to create one
 

5937
01:48:29,840 --> 01:48:32,709
you ha you have to create one
without any government or corporate

5938
01:48:32,709 --> 01:48:32,719
without any government or corporate

non-sensorable
so basically no way

5948
01:48:44,950 --> 01:48:44,960
so basically no way
 

5949
01:48:44,960 --> 01:48:46,870
so basically no way
for you without

5950
01:48:46,870 --> 01:48:46,880
for you without
 

5951
01:48:46,880 --> 01:48:49,510
for you without
explicitly saying so outsourcing control

5952
01:48:49,510 --> 01:48:49,520
explicitly saying so outsourcing control
 

5953
01:48:49,520 --> 01:48:52,870
explicitly saying so outsourcing control
to somebody else so it's a kind of

5954
01:48:52,870 --> 01:48:52,880
to somebody else so it's a kind of
 

5955
01:48:52,880 --> 01:48:54,950
to somebody else so it's a kind of
you have full control

5956
01:48:54,950 --> 01:48:54,960
you have full control
 

5957
01:48:54,960 --> 01:48:56,790
you have full control
even with the barrel of oil

5958
01:48:56,790 --> 01:48:56,800
even with the barrel of oil
 

5959
01:48:56,800 --> 01:48:58,550
even with the barrel of oil
um what's the difference in between a

5960
01:48:58,550 --> 01:48:58,560
um what's the difference in between a
 

5961
01:48:58,560 --> 01:49:00,950
um what's the difference in between a
barrel of oil and a bitcoin

5962
01:49:00,950 --> 01:49:00,960
barrel of oil and a bitcoin
 

5963
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:01,910
barrel of oil and a bitcoin
to you

5964
01:49:01,910 --> 01:49:01,920
to you
 

5965
01:49:01,920 --> 01:49:03,189
to you
what is the

5966
01:49:03,189 --> 01:49:03,199
what is the
 

5967
01:49:03,199 --> 01:49:05,030
what is the
because you kind of

5968
01:49:05,030 --> 01:49:05,040
because you kind of
 

5969
01:49:05,040 --> 01:49:08,149
because you kind of
mentioned that both are property is uh

5970
01:49:08,149 --> 01:49:08,159
mentioned that both are property is uh
 

5971
01:49:08,159 --> 01:49:10,310
mentioned that both are property is uh
you mentioned russia and china and so on

5972
01:49:10,310 --> 01:49:10,320
you mentioned russia and china and so on
 

5973
01:49:10,320 --> 01:49:12,229
you mentioned russia and china and so on
is is it the ability of the government

5974
01:49:12,229 --> 01:49:12,239
is is it the ability of the government
 

5975
01:49:12,239 --> 01:49:13,589
is is it the ability of the government
to confiscate

5976
01:49:13,589 --> 01:49:13,599
to confiscate
 

5977
01:49:13,599 --> 01:49:15,430
to confiscate
in the end governments can probably

5978
01:49:15,430 --> 01:49:15,440
in the end governments can probably
 

5979
01:49:15,440 --> 01:49:17,510
in the end governments can probably
confiscate no matter what the asset is

5980
01:49:17,510 --> 01:49:17,520
confiscate no matter what the asset is
 

5981
01:49:17,520 --> 01:49:19,669
confiscate no matter what the asset is
but you want to lessen the

5982
01:49:19,669 --> 01:49:19,679
but you want to lessen the
 

5983
01:49:19,679 --> 01:49:22,149
but you want to lessen the
um effort involved a barrel oil is a

5984
01:49:22,149 --> 01:49:22,159
um effort involved a barrel oil is a
 

5985
01:49:22,159 --> 01:49:25,510
um effort involved a barrel oil is a
bucket of physical property liquidity

5986
01:49:25,510 --> 01:49:25,520
bucket of physical property liquidity
 

5987
01:49:25,520 --> 01:49:27,990
bucket of physical property liquidity
bitcoin is a digital property but it's

a barrel of oil
 

5993
01:49:32,320 --> 01:49:34,310
a barrel of oil
it's easier to confiscate things in the

5994
01:49:34,310 --> 01:49:34,320
it's easier to confiscate things in the
 

5995
01:49:34,320 --> 01:49:37,350
it's easier to confiscate things in the
real world than things in cyberspace

5996
01:49:37,350 --> 01:49:37,360
real world than things in cyberspace
 

5997
01:49:37,360 --> 01:49:39,830
real world than things in cyberspace
much easier so that's not universally

5998
01:49:39,830 --> 01:49:39,840
much easier so that's not universally
 

5999
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:41,990
much easier so that's not universally
true some things in the digital space

just the nature of how things move

just the nature of how things move
 

6009
01:49:48,560 --> 01:49:50,470
just the nature of how things move
easily with information right so i think

6010
01:49:50,470 --> 01:49:50,480
easily with information right so i think
 

6011
01:49:50,480 --> 01:49:52,470
easily with information right so i think
in the bitcoin world what we would say

6012
01:49:52,470 --> 01:49:52,480
in the bitcoin world what we would say
 

6013
01:49:52,480 --> 01:49:54,870
in the bitcoin world what we would say
is that is the bitcoin is the most

6014
01:49:54,870 --> 01:49:54,880
is that is the bitcoin is the most
 

6015
01:49:54,880 --> 01:49:57,350
is that is the bitcoin is the most
difficult property

invented to confiscate and that's by
 

6021
01:50:02,880 --> 01:50:04,550
invented to confiscate and that's by
virtue of the fact that you could take

on the securities law they don't even
 

6183
01:52:56,800 --> 01:52:58,790
on the securities law they don't even
know the securities law

6184
01:52:58,790 --> 01:52:58,800
know the securities law
 

6185
01:52:58,800 --> 01:53:00,790
know the securities law
if you focus on the securities law that

6186
01:53:00,790 --> 01:53:00,800
if you focus on the securities law that
 

6187
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:03,669
if you focus on the securities law that
would say you just can't legally

6188
01:53:03,669 --> 01:53:03,679
would say you just can't legally
 

6189
01:53:03,679 --> 01:53:05,990
would say you just can't legally
sell this stuff to the general public or

6190
01:53:05,990 --> 01:53:06,000
sell this stuff to the general public or
 

6191
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,709
sell this stuff to the general public or
promote it without a full set of

6192
01:53:08,709 --> 01:53:08,719
promote it without a full set of
 

6193
01:53:08,719 --> 01:53:12,390
promote it without a full set of
continuing disclosures signed off on by

6194
01:53:12,390 --> 01:53:12,400
continuing disclosures signed off on by
 

6195
01:53:12,400 --> 01:53:13,669
continuing disclosures signed off on by
a regulator

6196
01:53:13,669 --> 01:53:13,679
a regulator
 

6197
01:53:13,679 --> 01:53:14,550
a regulator
so

6198
01:53:14,550 --> 01:53:14,560
so
 

6199
01:53:14,560 --> 01:53:17,270
so
so uh there's a fairly bright line there

6200
01:53:17,270 --> 01:53:17,280
so uh there's a fairly bright line there
 

6201
01:53:17,280 --> 01:53:19,669
so uh there's a fairly bright line there
with regard to securities but when you

6202
01:53:19,669 --> 01:53:19,679
with regard to securities but when you
 

6203
01:53:19,679 --> 01:53:21,189
with regard to securities but when you
get to the

6204
01:53:21,189 --> 01:53:21,199
get to the
 

6205
01:53:21,199 --> 01:53:23,990
get to the
when you get to the secondary issue it's

6206
01:53:23,990 --> 01:53:24,000
when you get to the secondary issue it's
 

6207
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:27,270
when you get to the secondary issue it's
how do you actually build a world

6208
01:53:27,270 --> 01:53:27,280
how do you actually build a world
 

6209
01:53:27,280 --> 01:53:29,589
how do you actually build a world
based on digital property

6210
01:53:29,589 --> 01:53:29,599
based on digital property
 

6211
01:53:29,599 --> 01:53:32,390
based on digital property
if public figures

6212
01:53:32,390 --> 01:53:32,400
if public figures
 

6213
01:53:32,400 --> 01:53:33,430
if public figures
can't

6214
01:53:33,430 --> 01:53:33,440
can't
 

6215
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:36,310
can't
can't embrace it or endorse it

6216
01:53:36,310 --> 01:53:36,320
can't embrace it or endorse it
 

6217
01:53:36,320 --> 01:53:38,229
can't embrace it or endorse it
you see so you're not going to build a

6218
01:53:38,229 --> 01:53:38,239
you see so you're not going to build a
 

6219
01:53:38,239 --> 01:53:41,109
you see so you're not going to build a
better world based upon

6220
01:53:41,109 --> 01:53:41,119
better world based upon
 

6221
01:53:41,119 --> 01:53:43,270
better world based upon
twitter stock if that's your idea of

6222
01:53:43,270 --> 01:53:43,280
twitter stock if that's your idea of
 

6223
01:53:43,280 --> 01:53:45,830
twitter stock if that's your idea of
property because twitter stock is a

6224
01:53:45,830 --> 01:53:45,840
property because twitter stock is a
 

6225
01:53:45,840 --> 01:53:48,070
property because twitter stock is a
security and twitter stock is never

6226
01:53:48,070 --> 01:53:48,080
security and twitter stock is never
 

6227
01:53:48,080 --> 01:53:49,990
security and twitter stock is never
going to be a non-sovereign bearer

6228
01:53:49,990 --> 01:53:50,000
going to be a non-sovereign bearer
 

6229
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,950
going to be a non-sovereign bearer
instrument in russia right or in china

6230
01:53:52,950 --> 01:53:52,960
instrument in russia right or in china
 

6231
01:53:52,960 --> 01:53:54,709
instrument in russia right or in china
right it's not even legal in china right

6232
01:53:54,709 --> 01:53:54,719
right it's not even legal in china right
 

6233
01:53:54,719 --> 01:53:57,990
right it's not even legal in china right
so it's not a global permissionless open

6234
01:53:57,990 --> 01:53:58,000
so it's not a global permissionless open
 

6235
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,070
so it's not a global permissionless open
thing it will never be trusted by the

6236
01:54:00,070 --> 01:54:00,080
thing it will never be trusted by the
 

6237
01:54:00,080 --> 01:54:02,149
thing it will never be trusted by the
rest of the world and

6238
01:54:02,149 --> 01:54:02,159
rest of the world and
 

6239
01:54:02,159 --> 01:54:04,629
rest of the world and
legally it's impractical but you know

6240
01:54:04,629 --> 01:54:04,639
legally it's impractical but you know
 

6241
01:54:04,639 --> 01:54:05,990
legally it's impractical but you know
would you really want to put a hundred

6242
01:54:05,990 --> 01:54:06,000
would you really want to put a hundred
 

6243
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:07,990
would you really want to put a hundred
trillion dollars worth of economic value

6244
01:54:07,990 --> 01:54:08,000
trillion dollars worth of economic value
 

6245
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:09,430
trillion dollars worth of economic value
on twitter stock if there's a board of

6246
01:54:09,430 --> 01:54:09,440
on twitter stock if there's a board of
 

6247
01:54:09,440 --> 01:54:11,430
on twitter stock if there's a board of
directors and a ceo that could just get

6248
01:54:11,430 --> 01:54:11,440
directors and a ceo that could just get
 

6249
01:54:11,440 --> 01:54:13,270
directors and a ceo that could just get
up and like take half of it tomorrow the

6250
01:54:13,270 --> 01:54:13,280
up and like take half of it tomorrow the
 

6251
01:54:13,280 --> 01:54:15,270
up and like take half of it tomorrow the
answer is no so

6252
01:54:15,270 --> 01:54:15,280
answer is no so
 

6253
01:54:15,280 --> 01:54:17,270
answer is no so
if you want to if you want to build a

6254
01:54:17,270 --> 01:54:17,280
if you want to if you want to build a
 

6255
01:54:17,280 --> 01:54:18,870
if you want to if you want to build a
better world

6256
01:54:18,870 --> 01:54:18,880
better world
 

6257
01:54:18,880 --> 01:54:20,870
better world
based on digital energy

6258
01:54:20,870 --> 01:54:20,880
based on digital energy
 

6259
01:54:20,880 --> 01:54:23,030
based on digital energy
you need to start with constructing a

6260
01:54:23,030 --> 01:54:23,040
you need to start with constructing a
 

6261
01:54:23,040 --> 01:54:24,950
you need to start with constructing a
digital property

6262
01:54:24,950 --> 01:54:24,960
digital property
 

6263
01:54:24,960 --> 01:54:28,149
digital property
and i'm using property here

6264
01:54:28,149 --> 01:54:28,159
and i'm using property here
 

6265
01:54:28,159 --> 01:54:31,030
and i'm using property here
open permissionless in a legal sense

6266
01:54:31,030 --> 01:54:31,040
open permissionless in a legal sense
 

6267
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:33,750
open permissionless in a legal sense
okay but i would also go to the next

6268
01:54:33,750 --> 01:54:33,760
okay but i would also go to the next
 

6269
01:54:33,760 --> 01:54:35,109
okay but i would also go to the next
step and say

6270
01:54:35,109 --> 01:54:35,119
step and say
 

6271
01:54:35,119 --> 01:54:36,790
step and say
property is

6272
01:54:36,790 --> 01:54:36,800
property is
 

6273
01:54:36,800 --> 01:54:39,189
property is
low frequency money

6274
01:54:39,189 --> 01:54:39,199
low frequency money
 

6275
01:54:39,199 --> 01:54:41,589
low frequency money
so if you if i give you a million

6276
01:54:41,589 --> 01:54:41,599
so if you if i give you a million
 

6277
01:54:41,599 --> 01:54:43,510
so if you if i give you a million
dollars

6278
01:54:43,510 --> 01:54:43,520
dollars
 

6279
01:54:43,520 --> 01:54:46,229
dollars
and you want to hold it for a decade

6280
01:54:46,229 --> 01:54:46,239
and you want to hold it for a decade
 

6281
01:54:46,239 --> 01:54:48,790
and you want to hold it for a decade
you might go buy a house with it

6282
01:54:48,790 --> 01:54:48,800
you might go buy a house with it
 

6283
01:54:48,800 --> 01:54:49,750
you might go buy a house with it
right and

6284
01:54:49,750 --> 01:54:49,760
right and
 

6285
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:51,750
right and
the house is low frequency money you

6286
01:54:51,750 --> 01:54:51,760
the house is low frequency money you
 

6287
01:54:51,760 --> 01:54:53,270
the house is low frequency money you
converted the

6288
01:54:53,270 --> 01:54:53,280
converted the
 

6289
01:54:53,280 --> 01:54:55,910
converted the
the million dollars of economic energy

6290
01:54:55,910 --> 01:54:55,920
the million dollars of economic energy
 

6291
01:54:55,920 --> 01:54:58,470
the million dollars of economic energy
into a structure called a house maybe

6292
01:54:58,470 --> 01:54:58,480
into a structure called a house maybe
 

6293
01:54:58,480 --> 01:55:00,310
into a structure called a house maybe
and after a decade you might convert it

6294
01:55:00,310 --> 01:55:00,320
and after a decade you might convert it
 

6295
01:55:00,320 --> 01:55:02,310
and after a decade you might convert it
back into energy you might sell the

6296
01:55:02,310 --> 01:55:02,320
back into energy you might sell the
 

6297
01:55:02,320 --> 01:55:04,629
back into energy you might sell the
house for currency

6298
01:55:04,629 --> 01:55:04,639
house for currency
 

6299
01:55:04,639 --> 01:55:06,550
house for currency
and it'll be more worth more or less

6300
01:55:06,550 --> 01:55:06,560
and it'll be more worth more or less
 

6301
01:55:06,560 --> 01:55:08,390
and it'll be more worth more or less
depending upon the monetary climate the

6302
01:55:08,390 --> 01:55:08,400
depending upon the monetary climate the
 

6303
01:55:08,400 --> 01:55:12,390
depending upon the monetary climate the
frequency means what here uh how quickly

6304
01:55:12,390 --> 01:55:12,400
frequency means what here uh how quickly
 

6305
01:55:12,400 --> 01:55:14,870
frequency means what here uh how quickly
it changes state how quickly does

6306
01:55:14,870 --> 01:55:14,880
it changes state how quickly does
 

6307
01:55:14,880 --> 01:55:17,109
it changes state how quickly does
something vibrate

6308
01:55:17,109 --> 01:55:17,119
something vibrate
 

6309
01:55:17,119 --> 01:55:18,629
something vibrate
so

6310
01:55:18,629 --> 01:55:18,639
so
 

6311
01:55:18,639 --> 01:55:21,030
so
if uh if i transfer

6312
01:55:21,030 --> 01:55:21,040
if uh if i transfer
 

6313
01:55:21,040 --> 01:55:22,950
if uh if i transfer
ten dollars from me to you

6314
01:55:22,950 --> 01:55:22,960
ten dollars from me to you
 

6315
01:55:22,960 --> 01:55:24,470
ten dollars from me to you
for a drink

6316
01:55:24,470 --> 01:55:24,480
for a drink
 

6317
01:55:24,480 --> 01:55:26,310
for a drink
and then you turn around you buy another

6318
01:55:26,310 --> 01:55:26,320
and then you turn around you buy another
 

6319
01:55:26,320 --> 01:55:28,390
and then you turn around you buy another
right we're vibrating on a frequency of

6320
01:55:28,390 --> 01:55:28,400
right we're vibrating on a frequency of
 

6321
01:55:28,400 --> 01:55:30,950
right we're vibrating on a frequency of
every few hours right the energy is

6322
01:55:30,950 --> 01:55:30,960
every few hours right the energy is
 

6323
01:55:30,960 --> 01:55:33,270
every few hours right the energy is
changing hands but it's not likely that

6324
01:55:33,270 --> 01:55:33,280
changing hands but it's not likely that
 

6325
01:55:33,280 --> 01:55:36,310
changing hands but it's not likely that
you sell and buy houses every few hours

6326
01:55:36,310 --> 01:55:36,320
you sell and buy houses every few hours
 

6327
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:39,589
you sell and buy houses every few hours
right the frequency of um of a of a

6328
01:55:39,589 --> 01:55:39,599
right the frequency of um of a of a
 

6329
01:55:39,599 --> 01:55:41,589
right the frequency of um of a of a
transaction in real estate is every 10

6330
01:55:41,589 --> 01:55:41,599
transaction in real estate is every 10
 

6331
01:55:41,599 --> 01:55:43,990
transaction in real estate is every 10
years every five years it's a much lower

6332
01:55:43,990 --> 01:55:44,000
years every five years it's a much lower
 

6333
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,070
years every five years it's a much lower
frequency transaction

6334
01:55:46,070 --> 01:55:46,080
frequency transaction
 

6335
01:55:46,080 --> 01:55:48,390
frequency transaction
and um

6336
01:55:48,390 --> 01:55:48,400
and um
 

6337
01:55:48,400 --> 01:55:49,109
and um
so

6338
01:55:49,109 --> 01:55:49,119
so
 

6339
01:55:49,119 --> 01:55:51,589
so
when you think about uh what's going on

6340
01:55:51,589 --> 01:55:51,599
when you think about uh what's going on
 

6341
01:55:51,599 --> 01:55:55,189
when you think about uh what's going on
here you have extremely low frequency

6342
01:55:55,189 --> 01:55:55,199
here you have extremely low frequency
 

6343
01:55:55,199 --> 01:55:56,470
here you have extremely low frequency
things

6344

things
 

6345
01:55:56,480 --> 01:55:59,270
things
which we'll call property then you have

6346
01:55:59,270 --> 01:55:59,280
which we'll call property then you have
 

6347
01:55:59,280 --> 01:56:01,109
which we'll call property then you have
mid-frequency

6348
01:56:01,109 --> 01:56:01,119
mid-frequency
 

6349
01:56:01,119 --> 01:56:03,030

currency
 

6353
01:56:04,560 --> 01:56:07,350
currency
and then you have high frequency

6354
01:56:07,350 --> 01:56:07,360
and then you have high frequency
 

6355
01:56:07,360 --> 01:56:09,030
and then you have high frequency
and that's energy

6356
01:56:09,030 --> 01:56:09,040
and that's energy
 

6357
01:56:09,040 --> 01:56:11,109
and that's energy
and that's why i use the illustration of

of the transfer of energy you have to
 

6457
01:58:06,560 --> 01:58:09,750
of the transfer of energy you have to
leverage some of these um

6458

settlement layer and we're we're going

6474
01:58:24,950 --> 01:58:24,960
settlement layer and we're we're going
 

6475
01:58:24,960 --> 01:58:27,830
settlement layer and we're we're going
to do 350 000 transactions or less a day

6476
01:58:27,830 --> 01:58:27,840
to do 350 000 transactions or less a day

100 million transactions a year is the
 

6479
01:58:29,840 --> 01:58:33,109
100 million transactions a year is the
bandwidth on the layer one and

bandwidth on the layer one and
 

6481
01:58:33,119 --> 01:58:34,870
bandwidth on the layer one and
it would be an ideal layer of one to

to move a billion dollars from here to
 

6519
01:59:13,119 --> 01:59:15,189
to move a billion dollars from here to
tokyo the big trick is to move a billion

and uh and that's
 

6525
01:59:21,840 --> 01:59:23,510
and uh and that's
that's what we want to solve with layer

6526
01:59:23,510 --> 01:59:23,520
that's what we want to solve with layer
 

6527

what you want is a city block

6534
01:59:31,350 --> 01:59:31,360
what you want is a city block
 

6535
01:59:31,360 --> 01:59:33,990
what you want is a city block
of a bedrock and how long has it been

6536
01:59:33,990 --> 01:59:34,000
of a bedrock and how long has it been
 

6537
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:35,270
of a bedrock and how long has it been
there like

6538
01:59:35,270 --> 01:59:35,280
there like
 

6539
01:59:35,280 --> 01:59:37,430
there like
millions of years it's been there and

6540
01:59:37,430 --> 01:59:37,440
millions of years it's been there and
 

6541
01:59:37,440 --> 01:59:39,270
millions of years it's been there and
how fast you want it to move

6542
01:59:39,270 --> 01:59:39,280
how fast you want it to move
 

6543
01:59:39,280 --> 01:59:40,629
how fast you want it to move
you don't

6544
01:59:40,629 --> 01:59:40,639
you don't

in fact the single thing that's most

6546
01:59:42,470 --> 01:59:42,480
in fact the single thing that's most
 

6547
01:59:42,480 --> 01:59:45,109
in fact the single thing that's most
important is that it not deflect

6548
01:59:45,109 --> 01:59:45,119
important is that it not deflect
 

6549
01:59:45,119 --> 01:59:46,629
important is that it not deflect
if it deflects

6550
01:59:46,629 --> 01:59:46,639
if it deflects
 

6551
01:59:46,639 --> 01:59:49,109
if it deflects
a foot in a hundred years it's too much

6552
01:59:49,109 --> 01:59:49,119
a foot in a hundred years it's too much
 

6553
01:59:49,119 --> 01:59:50,950
a foot in a hundred years it's too much
if it deflects an inch and a hundred

6554
01:59:50,950 --> 01:59:50,960
if it deflects an inch and a hundred
 

6555
01:59:50,960 --> 01:59:52,950
if it deflects an inch and a hundred
years you might not want that

6556
01:59:52,950 --> 01:59:52,960
years you might not want that
 

6557
01:59:52,960 --> 01:59:55,030
years you might not want that
so the layer one of bitcoin is a

6558
01:59:55,030 --> 01:59:55,040
so the layer one of bitcoin is a
 

6559
01:59:55,040 --> 01:59:57,430
so the layer one of bitcoin is a
foundation upon which you put weight how

6668
02:01:56,550 --> 02:01:56,560
yeah
 

6669
02:01:56,560 --> 02:01:57,430
yeah
so

6670
02:01:57,430 --> 02:01:57,440
so
 

6671
02:01:57,440 --> 02:02:00,229
so
the layer one is the foundation for the

6672
02:02:00,229 --> 02:02:00,239
the layer one is the foundation for the
 

6673
02:02:00,239 --> 02:02:02,629
the layer one is the foundation for the
entire cyber economy

6674
02:02:02,629 --> 02:02:02,639
entire cyber economy
 

6675
02:02:02,639 --> 02:02:04,790
entire cyber economy
and um

6676
02:02:04,790 --> 02:02:04,800
and um
 

6677
02:02:04,800 --> 02:02:07,030
and um
we don't want it to move fast what we

6678
02:02:07,030 --> 02:02:07,040
we don't want it to move fast what we
 

6679
02:02:07,040 --> 02:02:10,870
we don't want it to move fast what we
want what we want is is immortality

6680
02:02:10,870 --> 02:02:10,880
want what we want is is immortality
 

6681
02:02:10,880 --> 02:02:13,350
want what we want is is immortality
incorrupt immortal and corruptible

6682
02:02:13,350 --> 02:02:13,360
incorrupt immortal and corruptible
 

6683
02:02:13,360 --> 02:02:15,270
incorrupt immortal and corruptible
indestructible

6684
02:02:15,270 --> 02:02:15,280
indestructible
 

6685
02:02:15,280 --> 02:02:16,950
indestructible
right that that's what you want

6686
02:02:16,950 --> 02:02:16,960
right that that's what you want
 

6687
02:02:16,960 --> 02:02:19,270
right that that's what you want
integrity from the layer one now there's

6688
02:02:19,270 --> 02:02:19,280
integrity from the layer one now there's
 

6689
02:02:19,280 --> 02:02:21,830
integrity from the layer one now there's
layer two and layer three and layer two

6690
02:02:21,830 --> 02:02:21,840
layer two and layer three and layer two
 

6691
02:02:21,840 --> 02:02:25,030
layer two and layer three and layer two
i would define as an open permissionless

6692
02:02:25,030 --> 02:02:25,040
i would define as an open permissionless
 

6693
02:02:25,040 --> 02:02:26,709
i would define as an open permissionless
non-custodial

6694
02:02:26,709 --> 02:02:26,719
non-custodial
 

6695
02:02:26,719 --> 02:02:28,310
non-custodial
protocol

6696
02:02:28,310 --> 02:02:28,320
protocol
 

6697
02:02:28,320 --> 02:02:31,350
protocol
that uses uh the underlying layer one

6698
02:02:31,350 --> 02:02:31,360
that uses uh the underlying layer one
 

6699
02:02:31,360 --> 02:02:34,790
that uses uh the underlying layer one
token as its as its gas fee so what's

6700
02:02:34,790 --> 02:02:34,800
token as its as its gas fee so what's
 

6701
02:02:34,800 --> 02:02:37,189
token as its as its gas fee so what's
custodial mean and how does the

6702
02:02:37,189 --> 02:02:37,199
custodial mean and how does the
 

6703
02:02:37,199 --> 02:02:39,510
custodial mean and how does the
different markets like uh is lightning

6704
02:02:39,510 --> 02:02:39,520
different markets like uh is lightning
 

6705
02:02:39,520 --> 02:02:41,510
different markets like uh is lightning
network so lightning network would be an

6706
02:02:41,510 --> 02:02:41,520
network so lightning network would be an
 

6707
02:02:41,520 --> 02:02:44,550
network so lightning network would be an
example of a layer two non-custodial

6708
02:02:44,550 --> 02:02:44,560
example of a layer two non-custodial
 

6709
02:02:44,560 --> 02:02:46,390
example of a layer two non-custodial
so the lightning network

6710
02:02:46,390 --> 02:02:46,400
so the lightning network
 

6711
02:02:46,400 --> 02:02:49,589
so the lightning network
will sit on top of uh of layer one it'll

6712
02:02:49,589 --> 02:02:49,599
will sit on top of uh of layer one it'll
 

6713
02:02:49,599 --> 02:02:51,510
will sit on top of uh of layer one it'll
sit on top of bitcoin

6714
02:02:51,510 --> 02:02:51,520
sit on top of bitcoin
 

6715
02:02:51,520 --> 02:02:53,910
sit on top of bitcoin
and it solves the what you want to do is

6716
02:02:53,910 --> 02:02:53,920
and it solves the what you want to do is
 

6717
02:02:53,920 --> 02:02:55,910
and it solves the what you want to do is
solve the problem of

6718
02:02:55,910 --> 02:02:55,920
solve the problem of
 

6719
02:02:55,920 --> 02:02:57,589
solve the problem of
it's well and fine i don't want to move

6720
02:02:57,589 --> 02:02:57,599
it's well and fine i don't want to move
 

6721
02:02:57,599 --> 02:02:59,750
it's well and fine i don't want to move
a billion dollars every day what i want

6722
02:02:59,750 --> 02:02:59,760
a billion dollars every day what i want
 

6723
02:02:59,760 --> 02:03:02,790
a billion dollars every day what i want
to move is five dollars

6724
02:03:02,790 --> 02:03:02,800
to move is five dollars
 

6725
02:03:02,800 --> 02:03:04,870
to move is five dollars
a billion times a day

6726
02:03:04,870 --> 02:03:04,880
a billion times a day
 

6727
02:03:04,880 --> 02:03:06,709
a billion times a day
so if i want to move five dollars a

6728
02:03:06,709 --> 02:03:06,719
so if i want to move five dollars a
 

6729
02:03:06,719 --> 02:03:09,030
so if i want to move five dollars a
billion times a day i don't really need

6730
02:03:09,030 --> 02:03:09,040
billion times a day i don't really need
 

6731
02:03:09,040 --> 02:03:11,589
billion times a day i don't really need
to put the entire trillion

6732
02:03:11,589 --> 02:03:11,599
to put the entire trillion
 

6733
02:03:11,599 --> 02:03:14,229
to put the entire trillion
dollars of assets at risk every time i

6734
02:03:14,229 --> 02:03:14,239
dollars of assets at risk every time i
 

6735
02:03:14,239 --> 02:03:15,990
dollars of assets at risk every time i
move five dollars

6736
02:03:15,990 --> 02:03:16,000
move five dollars
 

6737
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,790
move five dollars
all i really need to do is put a hundred

6738
02:03:18,790 --> 02:03:18,800
all i really need to do is put a hundred
 

6739
02:03:18,800 --> 02:03:20,390
all i really need to do is put a hundred
thousand dollars in a channel or a

6740
02:03:20,390 --> 02:03:20,400
thousand dollars in a channel or a
 

6741
02:03:20,400 --> 02:03:22,550
thousand dollars in a channel or a
million dollars in a channel and then i

6742
02:03:22,550 --> 02:03:22,560
million dollars in a channel and then i
 

6743
02:03:22,560 --> 02:03:24,870
million dollars in a channel and then i
do 10 million transactions where i have

6744
02:03:24,870 --> 02:03:24,880
do 10 million transactions where i have
 

6745
02:03:24,880 --> 02:03:26,790
do 10 million transactions where i have
a million dollars at risk

6746
02:03:26,790 --> 02:03:26,800
a million dollars at risk
 

6747
02:03:26,800 --> 02:03:28,470
a million dollars at risk
and of course it's it's kind of simple

6748
02:03:28,470 --> 02:03:28,480
and of course it's it's kind of simple
 

6749
02:03:28,480 --> 02:03:31,510
and of course it's it's kind of simple
if i if i put

6750
02:03:31,510 --> 02:03:31,520
if i if i put
 

6751
02:03:31,520 --> 02:03:34,070
if i if i put
if i lower my security requirement by a

6752
02:03:34,070 --> 02:03:34,080
if i lower my security requirement by a
 

6753
02:03:34,080 --> 02:03:35,910
if i lower my security requirement by a
factor of a million

6754
02:03:35,910 --> 02:03:35,920
factor of a million
 

6755
02:03:35,920 --> 02:03:37,830
factor of a million
i can probably move the stuff a million

6756
02:03:37,830 --> 02:03:37,840
i can probably move the stuff a million
 

6757
02:03:37,840 --> 02:03:39,350
i can probably move the stuff a million
times faster

6758
02:03:39,350 --> 02:03:39,360
times faster
 

6759
02:03:39,360 --> 02:03:41,430
times faster
and that's how lightning works it's

6760
02:03:41,430 --> 02:03:41,440
and that's how lightning works it's
 

6761
02:03:41,440 --> 02:03:44,550
and that's how lightning works it's
non-custodial because there's no there's

6762
02:03:44,550 --> 02:03:44,560
non-custodial because there's no there's
 

6763
02:03:44,560 --> 02:03:47,350
non-custodial because there's no there's
no corporation or custodian or

6764
02:03:47,350 --> 02:03:47,360
no corporation or custodian or
 

6765
02:03:47,360 --> 02:03:49,910
no corporation or custodian or
counterparty you're trusting

6766
02:03:49,910 --> 02:03:49,920
counterparty you're trusting
 

6767
02:03:49,920 --> 02:03:51,589
counterparty you're trusting
right there's a there's the risk of

6768
02:03:51,589 --> 02:03:51,599
right there's a there's the risk of
 

6769
02:03:51,599 --> 02:03:53,270
right there's a there's the risk of
moving through the channel

6770
02:03:53,270 --> 02:03:53,280
moving through the channel
 

6771
02:03:53,280 --> 02:03:54,709
moving through the channel
but um

6772
02:03:54,709 --> 02:03:54,719
but um
 

6773
02:03:54,719 --> 02:03:57,750
but um
lightning is an example of how i go from

6774
02:03:57,750 --> 02:03:57,760
lightning is an example of how i go from
 

6775
02:03:57,760 --> 02:04:01,189
lightning is an example of how i go from
350 000 transactions a day to 350

6776
02:04:01,189 --> 02:04:01,199
350 000 transactions a day to 350
 

6777
02:04:01,199 --> 02:04:03,750
350 000 transactions a day to 350
million transactions a day so on that

6778
02:04:03,750 --> 02:04:03,760
million transactions a day so on that
 

6779
02:04:03,760 --> 02:04:06,149
million transactions a day so on that
layer too you could move the bitcoin in

6780
02:04:06,149 --> 02:04:06,159
layer too you could move the bitcoin in
 

6781
02:04:06,159 --> 02:04:08,550
layer too you could move the bitcoin in
seconds for fractions of pennies

6782
02:04:08,550 --> 02:04:08,560
seconds for fractions of pennies
 

6783
02:04:08,560 --> 02:04:09,510
seconds for fractions of pennies
now

6784
02:04:09,510 --> 02:04:09,520
now
 

6785
02:04:09,520 --> 02:04:11,350
now
that's not the end-all be-all because

6786
02:04:11,350 --> 02:04:11,360
that's not the end-all be-all because
 

6787
02:04:11,360 --> 02:04:13,750
that's not the end-all be-all because
the truth is there are a lot of open

6788
02:04:13,750 --> 02:04:13,760
the truth is there are a lot of open
 

6789
02:04:13,760 --> 02:04:15,669
the truth is there are a lot of open
protocols lightning probably won't be

02:04:15,679 --> 02:04:16,950

the only one there could you know

6792
02:04:16,950 --> 02:04:16,960
the only one there could you know
 

6793
02:04:16,960 --> 02:04:19,109
the only one there could you know
there's an open market competition of

there's an open market competition of

02:04:19,119 --> 02:04:21,030
there's an open market competition of

6799
02:04:23,520 --> 02:04:26,069

02:04:26,069 --> 02:04:26,079
um and in theory

02:04:38,149 --> 02:04:38,159
potentially a layer two to bitcoin right
 

6811
02:04:38,159 --> 02:04:40,069
potentially a layer two to bitcoin right
there's a debate about are there any and

6812
02:04:40,069 --> 02:04:40,079
there's a debate about are there any and
 

6813
02:04:40,079 --> 02:04:41,750
there's a debate about are there any and
what are they and and we could leave

6814
02:04:41,750 --> 02:04:41,760
what are they and and we could leave
 

6815
02:04:41,760 --> 02:04:43,830
what are they and and we could leave
that for a later time but why do you

6816
02:04:43,830 --> 02:04:43,840
that for a later time but why do you
 

6817
02:04:43,840 --> 02:04:45,030
that for a later time but why do you
think of them

6818
02:04:45,030 --> 02:04:45,040
think of them
 

6819
02:04:45,040 --> 02:04:48,310
think of them
as layer two as opposed to contending

6820
02:04:48,310 --> 02:04:48,320
as layer two as opposed to contending
 

6821
02:04:48,320 --> 02:04:50,310
as layer two as opposed to contending
for layer one

for layer one
 

6823
02:04:50,320 --> 02:04:52,069
for layer one
yeah actually if they're using their own

02:04:52,069 --> 02:04:52,079
yeah actually if they're using their own

then they are a layer one if you create

6828
02:04:55,430 --> 02:04:55,440
then they are a layer one if you create
 

6829
02:04:55,440 --> 02:04:57,669
then they are a layer one if you create
an open protocol that uses the bitcoin

6830
02:04:57,669 --> 02:04:57,679
an open protocol that uses the bitcoin
 

6831
02:04:57,679 --> 02:05:00,550
an open protocol that uses the bitcoin
token as the as the fee

6832
02:05:00,550 --> 02:05:00,560
token as the as the fee
 

6833
02:05:00,560 --> 02:05:03,510
token as the as the fee
then it becomes a layer two okay right

6834
02:05:03,510 --> 02:05:03,520
then it becomes a layer two okay right
 

6835
02:05:03,520 --> 02:05:06,390
then it becomes a layer two okay right
bitcoin itself right incentivizes his

6836
02:05:06,390 --> 02:05:06,400
bitcoin itself right incentivizes his
 

6837
02:05:06,400 --> 02:05:08,390
bitcoin itself right incentivizes his
own transactions with its own token and

6838
02:05:08,390 --> 02:05:08,400
own transactions with its own token and
 

6839
02:05:08,400 --> 02:05:11,750
own transactions with its own token and
that's what makes it layer one

6840
02:05:11,750 --> 02:05:11,760
that's what makes it layer one
 

6841
02:05:11,760 --> 02:05:14,390
that's what makes it layer one
okay what's layer three then layer three

6842
02:05:14,390 --> 02:05:14,400
okay what's layer three then layer three
 

6843
02:05:14,400 --> 02:05:16,310
okay what's layer three then layer three
is a custodial layer

6844
02:05:16,310 --> 02:05:16,320
is a custodial layer
 

6845
02:05:16,320 --> 02:05:18,790
is a custodial layer
so if you wanna move bitcoin in

6846
02:05:18,790 --> 02:05:18,800
so if you wanna move bitcoin in
 

6847
02:05:18,800 --> 02:05:21,270
so if you wanna move bitcoin in
milliseconds for free

6848
02:05:21,270 --> 02:05:21,280
milliseconds for free
 

6849
02:05:21,280 --> 02:05:24,229
milliseconds for free
you move it through binance or coin base

6850
02:05:24,229 --> 02:05:24,239
you move it through binance or coin base
 

6851
02:05:24,239 --> 02:05:25,990
you move it through binance or coin base
or cash app

6852
02:05:25,990 --> 02:05:26,000
or cash app
 

6853
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:27,669
or cash app
so this is a very straightforward thing

6854
02:05:27,669 --> 02:05:27,679
so this is a very straightforward thing
 

6855
02:05:27,679 --> 02:05:29,669
so this is a very straightforward thing
i mean it seems pretty obvious when you

6856
02:05:29,669 --> 02:05:29,679
i mean it seems pretty obvious when you
 

6857
02:05:29,679 --> 02:05:31,030
i mean it seems pretty obvious when you
think about it that they're gonna be

6858
02:05:31,030 --> 02:05:31,040
think about it that they're gonna be
 

6859
02:05:31,040 --> 02:05:34,390
think about it that they're gonna be
hundreds of thousands of layer threes

6860
02:05:34,390 --> 02:05:34,400
hundreds of thousands of layer threes
 

6861
02:05:34,400 --> 02:05:36,870
hundreds of thousands of layer threes
there may be dozens of layer twos there

6862
02:05:36,870 --> 02:05:36,880
there may be dozens of layer twos there
 

6863
02:05:36,880 --> 02:05:38,870
there may be dozens of layer twos there
might i mean lightning is a1 but it's

6864
02:05:38,870 --> 02:05:38,880
might i mean lightning is a1 but it's
 

6865
02:05:38,880 --> 02:05:41,030
might i mean lightning is a1 but it's
not the only one anybody can invent

6866
02:05:41,030 --> 02:05:41,040
not the only one anybody can invent
 

6867
02:05:41,040 --> 02:05:42,310
not the only one anybody can invent
something

6868
02:05:42,310 --> 02:05:42,320
something
 

6869
02:05:42,320 --> 02:05:43,910
something
right and and

6870
02:05:43,910 --> 02:05:43,920
right and and
 

6871
02:05:43,920 --> 02:05:46,390
right and and
we can have this debate uh about

6872
02:05:46,390 --> 02:05:46,400
we can have this debate uh about
 

6873
02:05:46,400 --> 02:05:50,709
we can have this debate uh about
custodial non-custodial um

6874
02:05:50,709 --> 02:05:50,719
custodial non-custodial um
 

6875
02:05:50,719 --> 02:05:52,870
custodial non-custodial um
don't you think there's amount of

6876
02:05:52,870 --> 02:05:52,880
don't you think there's amount of
 

6877
02:05:52,880 --> 02:05:55,830
don't you think there's amount of
monopolization possibilities at layer

6878
02:05:55,830 --> 02:05:55,840
monopolization possibilities at layer
 

6879
02:05:55,840 --> 02:05:57,589
monopolization possibilities at layer
three

6880
02:05:57,589 --> 02:05:57,599
three
 

6881
02:05:57,599 --> 02:05:58,550
three
so

6882
02:05:58,550 --> 02:05:58,560
so
 

6883
02:05:58,560 --> 02:05:59,990
so
um

6884
02:05:59,990 --> 02:06:00,000
um
 

6885
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,149
um
you know coin you mentioned binance coin

6886
02:06:02,149 --> 02:06:02,159
you know coin you mentioned binance coin
 

6887
02:06:02,159 --> 02:06:04,629
you know coin you mentioned binance coin
coinbase what if they start to dominate

6888
02:06:04,629 --> 02:06:04,639
coinbase what if they start to dominate
 

6889
02:06:04,639 --> 02:06:07,270
coinbase what if they start to dominate
and basically everybody is using them

6890
02:06:07,270 --> 02:06:07,280
and basically everybody is using them
 

6891
02:06:07,280 --> 02:06:09,510
and basically everybody is using them
practically speaking and then it becomes

6892
02:06:09,510 --> 02:06:09,520
practically speaking and then it becomes
 

6893
02:06:09,520 --> 02:06:11,189
practically speaking and then it becomes
too costly to

6894
02:06:11,189 --> 02:06:11,199
too costly to
 

6895
02:06:11,199 --> 02:06:13,910
too costly to
memorize the uh the private key in your

6896
02:06:13,910 --> 02:06:13,920
memorize the uh the private key in your
 

6897
02:06:13,920 --> 02:06:15,030
memorize the uh the private key in your

i mean or like a cold storage of layer

6900
02:06:18,470 --> 02:06:18,480
i mean or like a cold storage of layer
 

6901
02:06:18,480 --> 02:06:21,030

02:06:21,030 --> 02:06:21,040
one technology the idealist
 

6903
02:06:21,040 --> 02:06:23,589

fear the layer threes because they think

6904
02:06:23,589 --> 02:06:23,599
fear the layer threes because they think
 

6905
02:06:23,599 --> 02:06:25,910
fear the layer threes because they think
and especially they did test

6906
02:06:25,910 --> 02:06:25,920
and especially they did test
 

6907
02:06:25,920 --> 02:06:28,229
and especially they did test
they would detest a bit

6908
02:06:28,229 --> 02:06:28,239
they would detest a bit
 

6909
02:06:28,239 --> 02:06:30,069
they would detest a bit
there's almost like a layer four by the

6910
02:06:30,069 --> 02:06:30,079
there's almost like a layer four by the
 

6911
02:06:30,079 --> 02:06:31,990
there's almost like a layer four by the
way if you want to a layer four would be

6912
02:06:31,990 --> 02:06:32,000
way if you want to a layer four would be
 

6913
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:35,270
way if you want to a layer four would be
i've got bitcoin on an application but i

6914
02:06:35,270 --> 02:06:35,280
i've got bitcoin on an application but i
 

6915
02:06:35,280 --> 02:06:37,589
i've got bitcoin on an application but i
can't withdraw it

6916
02:06:37,589 --> 02:06:37,599
can't withdraw it
 

6917
02:06:37,599 --> 02:06:39,750
can't withdraw it
so i've got an application that's backed

6918
02:06:39,750 --> 02:06:39,760
so i've got an application that's backed
 

6919
02:06:39,760 --> 02:06:42,550
so i've got an application that's backed
by bitcoin but the bitcoin is sealed

6920
02:06:42,550 --> 02:06:42,560
by bitcoin but the bitcoin is sealed
 

6921
02:06:42,560 --> 02:06:44,629
by bitcoin but the bitcoin is sealed
it's it's a proprietary example and i'll

6922
02:06:44,629 --> 02:06:44,639
it's it's a proprietary example and i'll
 

6923
02:06:44,639 --> 02:06:45,990
it's it's a proprietary example and i'll
give you example of that that would be

6924
02:06:45,990 --> 02:06:46,000
give you example of that that would be
 

6925
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:47,109
give you example of that that would be
like

6926
02:06:47,109 --> 02:06:47,119
like
 

6927
02:06:47,119 --> 02:06:48,470
like
grayscale

6928
02:06:48,470 --> 02:06:48,480
grayscale

if i own a share of gbtc
 

6931
02:06:51,119 --> 02:06:54,870
if i own a share of gbtc
and and so i own a security actually

6932
02:06:54,870 --> 02:06:54,880
and and so i own a security actually
 

6933
02:06:54,880 --> 02:06:57,189
and and so i own a security actually
you know you could own mstr

6934
02:06:57,189 --> 02:06:57,199
you know you could own mstr
 

6935
02:06:57,199 --> 02:06:59,030
you know you could own mstr
if you own a security or you own a

6936
02:06:59,030 --> 02:06:59,040
if you own a security or you own a
 

6937
02:06:59,040 --> 02:07:01,189
if you own a security or you own a
product that has bitcoin embedded in it

6938
02:07:01,189 --> 02:07:01,199
product that has bitcoin embedded in it
 

6939
02:07:01,199 --> 02:07:04,149
product that has bitcoin embedded in it
you get the benefits of bitcoin but you

6940
02:07:04,149 --> 02:07:04,159
you get the benefits of bitcoin but you
 

6941
02:07:04,159 --> 02:07:06,390
you get the benefits of bitcoin but you
don't have the ability to withdraw

6942
02:07:06,390 --> 02:07:06,400
don't have the ability to withdraw
 

6943
02:07:06,400 --> 02:07:09,189
don't have the ability to withdraw
the asset so you have a security market

6944
02:07:09,189 --> 02:07:09,199
the asset so you have a security market
 

6945
02:07:09,199 --> 02:07:11,510
the asset so you have a security market
at layer four am i understanding this

6946
02:07:11,510 --> 02:07:11,520
at layer four am i understanding this
 

6947
02:07:11,520 --> 02:07:12,629
at layer four am i understanding this
correctly

6948
02:07:12,629 --> 02:07:12,639

i don't know if i would say

6950
02:07:14,950 --> 02:07:14,960
i don't know if i would say
 

6951
02:07:14,960 --> 02:07:16,950
i don't know if i would say
i don't not all securities are layer

6952
02:07:16,950 --> 02:07:16,960
i don't not all securities are layer
 

6953
02:07:16,960 --> 02:07:18,870
i don't not all securities are layer
four but but anything that's a

6954
02:07:18,870 --> 02:07:18,880
four but but anything that's a
 

6955
02:07:18,880 --> 02:07:22,390

02:07:26,470 --> 02:07:26,480
withdraw the bitcoin
 

6961
02:07:26,480 --> 02:07:29,030
withdraw the bitcoin
is another application of bitcoin

6962
02:07:29,030 --> 02:07:29,040
is another application of bitcoin

02:07:29,040 --> 02:07:31,589
is another application of bitcoin
so if if you think about different ways

6964
02:07:31,589 --> 02:07:31,599
so if if you think about different ways
 

6965
02:07:31,599 --> 02:07:33,510
so if if you think about different ways
you can use this

6966
02:07:33,510 --> 02:07:33,520
you can use this
 

6967
02:07:33,520 --> 02:07:35,430
you can use this
you can either stay completely on the

you can either stay completely on the
 

6969
02:07:35,440 --> 02:07:37,430
you can either stay completely on the
layer one and use the base chain for

6970
02:07:37,430 --> 02:07:37,440
layer one and use the base chain for
 

6971
02:07:37,440 --> 02:07:39,270
layer one and use the base chain for
your transactions

6972
02:07:39,270 --> 02:07:39,280
your transactions
 

6973
02:07:39,280 --> 02:07:40,709
your transactions
or you can

6974
02:07:40,709 --> 02:07:40,719
or you can
 

6975
02:07:40,719 --> 02:07:42,470
or you can
limit yourself to layer one and layer

02:07:42,470 --> 02:07:42,480
limit yourself to layer one and layer
 

6977

but you could also go to the layer three

6984
02:07:50,870 --> 02:07:50,880
but you could also go to the layer three
 

6985
02:07:50,880 --> 02:07:53,830

when cash app uh supported bitcoin they

6986
02:07:53,830 --> 02:07:53,840
when cash app uh supported bitcoin they
 

6987
02:07:53,840 --> 02:07:55,589
when cash app uh supported bitcoin they
made it very easy to buy it and then

02:10:04,560 --> 02:10:07,109
custody of those assets
and you don't have that option with most

7112
02:10:07,109 --> 02:10:07,119
and you don't have that option with most
 

7113
02:10:07,119 --> 02:10:09,430
and you don't have that option with most
other forms of property maybe you don't

7114
02:10:09,430 --> 02:10:09,440
other forms of property maybe you don't
 

7115
02:10:09,440 --> 02:10:11,669
other forms of property maybe you don't
have as much optionality

7116
02:10:11,669 --> 02:10:11,679
have as much optionality
 

7117

with any other form of property on earth
 

7119
02:10:13,520 --> 02:10:15,910
with any other form of property on earth
and so what what makes digital property

7120
02:10:15,910 --> 02:10:15,920

that do you do the thing that you
mentioned which is you have to build

7500
02:17:09,990 --> 02:17:10,000
mentioned which is you have to build
 

7501
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,469
mentioned which is you have to build
another app essentially that allows you

7502
02:17:12,469 --> 02:17:12,479
another app essentially that allows you
 

7503
02:17:12,479 --> 02:17:15,830
another app essentially that allows you
the flow of money outside the

7504
02:17:15,830 --> 02:17:15,840
the flow of money outside the

metaphorically speaking if you want to
 

7513
02:17:23,920 --> 02:17:25,270
metaphorically speaking if you want to
break out the constraints of your

02:17:25,270 --> 02:17:25,280
break out the constraints of your
 

7515
02:17:25,280 --> 02:17:27,750
break out the constraints of your
culture you learn to speak english

7516
02:17:27,750 --> 02:17:27,760
culture you learn to speak english
 

7517
02:17:27,760 --> 02:17:29,429
culture you learn to speak english
for example it's not illegal to speak

7518
02:17:29,429 --> 02:17:29,439
for example it's not illegal to speak
 

7519
02:17:29,439 --> 02:17:31,429
for example it's not illegal to speak
english or even if it is right it

7520
02:17:31,429 --> 02:17:31,439
english or even if it is right it
 

7521
02:17:31,439 --> 02:17:33,990
english or even if it is right it
doesn't matter but but english works

7522
02:17:33,990 --> 02:17:34,000
doesn't matter but but english works
 

7523

everywhere in the world if you can speak

7524

everywhere in the world if you can speak
 

7525
02:17:35,920 --> 02:17:39,190
everywhere in the world if you can speak
it and then you can tap into a global

7526
02:17:39,190 --> 02:17:39,200
it and then you can tap into a global
 

7527
02:17:39,200 --> 02:17:42,389
it and then you can tap into a global
commerce and intelligence network so

7528
02:17:42,389 --> 02:17:42,399
commerce and intelligence network so
 

7529
02:17:42,399 --> 02:17:44,389
commerce and intelligence network so
bitcoin is a language so you learn to

7530
02:17:44,389 --> 02:17:44,399
bitcoin is a language so you learn to
 

7531
02:17:44,399 --> 02:17:46,070
bitcoin is a language so you learn to
speak bitcoin or you learn to speak

7532
02:17:46,070 --> 02:17:46,080
speak bitcoin or you learn to speak
 

7533
02:17:46,080 --> 02:17:48,469
speak bitcoin or you learn to speak
lightning and then you tap into that

7534
02:17:48,469 --> 02:17:48,479
lightning and then you tap into that
 

7535
02:17:48,479 --> 02:17:50,230
lightning and then you tap into that
network in

7536
02:17:50,230 --> 02:17:50,240
network in
 

7537
02:17:50,240 --> 02:17:53,270
network in
you know whatever manner you can but the

7538
02:17:53,270 --> 02:17:53,280
you know whatever manner you can but the
 

7539
02:17:53,280 --> 02:17:54,629
you know whatever manner you can but the
problem is it's still very difficult to

7540
02:17:54,629 --> 02:17:54,639
problem is it's still very difficult to
 

7541
02:17:54,639 --> 02:17:56,389
problem is it's still very difficult to
move bitcoin around

7542
02:17:56,389 --> 02:17:56,399
move bitcoin around
 

7543
02:17:56,399 --> 02:17:59,270
move bitcoin around
in russia and ukraine now doing war

7544
02:17:59,270 --> 02:17:59,280
in russia and ukraine now doing war
 

7545
02:17:59,280 --> 02:18:00,790
in russia and ukraine now doing war
and there was a

7546
02:18:00,790 --> 02:18:00,800
and there was a
 

7547
02:18:00,800 --> 02:18:02,790
and there was a
sense to me that

7548
02:18:02,790 --> 02:18:02,800
sense to me that
 

7549
02:18:02,800 --> 02:18:04,790
sense to me that
the cryptocurrency in general could be

7550
02:18:04,790 --> 02:18:04,800
the cryptocurrency in general could be
 

7551
02:18:04,800 --> 02:18:06,150
the cryptocurrency in general could be
the savior

7552
02:18:06,150 --> 02:18:06,160
the savior
 

7553
02:18:06,160 --> 02:18:07,830
the savior
for helping people there's millions of

7554
02:18:07,830 --> 02:18:07,840
for helping people there's millions of
 

7555
02:18:07,840 --> 02:18:10,709
for helping people there's millions of
refugees they're moving all all around

7556
02:18:10,709 --> 02:18:10,719
refugees they're moving all all around
 

7557
02:18:10,719 --> 02:18:13,990
refugees they're moving all all around
it's very it's very difficult to

7558
02:18:13,990 --> 02:18:14,000
it's very it's very difficult to
 

7559
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:17,030
it's very it's very difficult to
move money around in that space to help

7560
02:18:17,030 --> 02:18:17,040
move money around in that space to help
 

7561
02:18:17,040 --> 02:18:17,990
move money around in that space to help
people

7562
02:18:17,990 --> 02:18:18,000
people
 

7563
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:19,750
people
i think we're very early

7564
02:18:19,750 --> 02:18:19,760
i think we're very early
 

7565
02:18:19,760 --> 02:18:22,230
i think we're very early
like like we're very embryonic here if

7566
02:18:22,230 --> 02:18:22,240
like like we're very embryonic here if
 

7567
02:18:22,240 --> 02:18:24,629
like like we're very embryonic here if
you look at the who's we sorry and we as

7568
02:18:24,629 --> 02:18:24,639
you look at the who's we sorry and we as
 

7569
02:18:24,639 --> 02:18:26,389
you look at the who's we sorry and we as
a human civilization are we

7570
02:18:26,389 --> 02:18:26,399
a human civilization are we
 

7571
02:18:26,399 --> 02:18:28,469
a human civilization are we
operating in the cryptocurrency space i

7572
02:18:28,469 --> 02:18:28,479
operating in the cryptocurrency space i
 

7573
02:18:28,479 --> 02:18:31,750
operating in the cryptocurrency space i
think the entire crypto economy is very

7574
02:18:31,750 --> 02:18:31,760
think the entire crypto economy is very
 

7575
02:18:31,760 --> 02:18:34,629
think the entire crypto economy is very
embryonic and and the human race's

7576
02:18:34,629 --> 02:18:34,639
embryonic and and the human race's
 

7577
02:18:34,639 --> 02:18:36,790
embryonic and and the human race's
adoption of it is embryonic we're like

7578
02:18:36,790 --> 02:18:36,800
adoption of it is embryonic we're like
 

7579
02:18:36,800 --> 02:18:41,349
adoption of it is embryonic we're like
one two percent down that adoption curve

7580
02:18:41,349 --> 02:18:41,359
one two percent down that adoption curve
 

7581
02:18:41,359 --> 02:18:43,910
one two percent down that adoption curve
if you take lightning for example the

7582
02:18:43,910 --> 02:18:43,920
if you take lightning for example the
 

7583
02:18:43,920 --> 02:18:45,509
if you take lightning for example the
you know the first real commercial

7584
02:18:45,509 --> 02:18:45,519
you know the first real commercial
 

7585
02:18:45,519 --> 02:18:47,110
you know the first real commercial
applications of lightning are just in

7586
02:18:47,110 --> 02:18:47,120
applications of lightning are just in
 

7587
02:18:47,120 --> 02:18:48,629
applications of lightning are just in
the last 12 months

7588
02:18:48,629 --> 02:18:48,639
the last 12 months
 

7589
02:18:48,639 --> 02:18:51,349
the last 12 months
yeah so we're like year one we might be

7590
02:18:51,349 --> 02:18:51,359
yeah so we're like year one we might be
 

7591
02:18:51,359 --> 02:18:53,349
yeah so we're like year one we might be
approaching year two of commercial

7592
02:18:53,349 --> 02:18:53,359
approaching year two of commercial
 

7593
02:18:53,359 --> 02:18:54,950
approaching year two of commercial
lightning adoption and if you look at

7594
02:18:54,950 --> 02:18:54,960
lightning adoption and if you look at
 

7595
02:18:54,960 --> 02:18:56,870
lightning adoption and if you look at
lightning adoption

7596
02:18:56,870 --> 02:18:56,880
lightning adoption
 

7597
02:18:56,880 --> 02:18:58,870
lightning adoption
lightning is not built into

7598
02:18:58,870 --> 02:18:58,880
lightning is not built into
 

7599
02:18:58,880 --> 02:19:01,110
lightning is not built into
coinbase it's not built into binance

7600
02:19:01,110 --> 02:19:01,120
coinbase it's not built into binance
 

7601
02:19:01,120 --> 02:19:04,870
coinbase it's not built into binance
it's not built into ftx it's it you know

7602
02:19:04,870 --> 02:19:04,880
it's not built into ftx it's it you know
 

7603
02:19:04,880 --> 02:19:06,950
it's not built into ftx it's it you know
cache app just implemented the first

7604
02:19:06,950 --> 02:19:06,960
cache app just implemented the first
 

7605
02:19:06,960 --> 02:19:08,629
cache app just implemented the first
implementation but not all the features

7606
02:19:08,629 --> 02:19:08,639
implementation but not all the features
 

7607
02:19:08,639 --> 02:19:10,469
implementation but not all the features
are built into it there's

7608
02:19:10,469 --> 02:19:10,479
are built into it there's
 

7609
02:19:10,479 --> 02:19:12,950
are built into it there's
a few dozen a dozen lightning wallets

7610
02:19:12,950 --> 02:19:12,960
a few dozen a dozen lightning wallets
 

7611
02:19:12,960 --> 02:19:15,110
a few dozen a dozen lightning wallets
circulating out there

7612
02:19:15,110 --> 02:19:15,120
circulating out there
 

7613
02:19:15,120 --> 02:19:17,110
circulating out there
so i i think that you know we're

7614
02:19:17,110 --> 02:19:17,120
so i i think that you know we're
 

7615
02:19:17,120 --> 02:19:19,589
so i i think that you know we're
probably going to be 36 months of

7616
02:19:19,589 --> 02:19:19,599
probably going to be 36 months of
 

7617
02:19:19,599 --> 02:19:21,910
probably going to be 36 months of
software development

7618
02:19:21,910 --> 02:19:21,920
software development
 

7619
02:19:21,920 --> 02:19:24,070
software development
at the point that um

7620
02:19:24,070 --> 02:19:24,080
at the point that um
 

7621
02:19:24,080 --> 02:19:27,030
at the point that um
every android phone and every iphone has

7622
02:19:27,030 --> 02:19:27,040
every android phone and every iphone has
 

7623
02:19:27,040 --> 02:19:28,150
every android phone and every iphone has
um

7624
02:19:28,150 --> 02:19:28,160
um
 

7625
02:19:28,160 --> 02:19:30,629
um
has a bitcoin wallet or a crypto wallet

7626
02:19:30,629 --> 02:19:30,639
has a bitcoin wallet or a crypto wallet
 

7627
02:19:30,639 --> 02:19:33,190
has a bitcoin wallet or a crypto wallet
in it of sorts

7628
02:19:33,190 --> 02:19:33,200
in it of sorts
 

7629
02:19:33,200 --> 02:19:35,910
in it of sorts
that's a big deal if if apple embraced

7630
02:19:35,910 --> 02:19:35,920
that's a big deal if if apple embraced
 

7631
02:19:35,920 --> 02:19:37,830
that's a big deal if if apple embraced
lightning that's a big deal

7632
02:19:37,830 --> 02:19:37,840
lightning that's a big deal
 

7633
02:19:37,840 --> 02:19:40,389
lightning that's a big deal
so the adoption is the thing like in a

7634
02:19:40,389 --> 02:19:40,399
so the adoption is the thing like in a
 

7635
02:19:40,399 --> 02:19:43,190
so the adoption is the thing like in a
war zone adoption

7636
02:19:43,190 --> 02:19:43,200

02:22:33,510 --> 02:22:33,520
store energy then you can eat yourself
 

7799
02:22:33,520 --> 02:22:35,349
store energy then you can eat yourself
to death i mean you will eat and you

7800

so the lack of property rights
is like being a type one diabetic

7806

is like being a type one diabetic
and so if you look at most people

7808
02:22:45,429 --> 02:22:45,439
and so if you look at most people
 

7809
02:22:45,439 --> 02:22:48,710
and so if you look at most people
everywhere in the world

7810
02:22:48,710 --> 02:22:48,720

 

7811
02:22:48,720 --> 02:22:50,710

does it last forever and does it orbit
 

8039
02:27:09,760 --> 02:27:12,070
does it last forever and does it orbit
forever or does it go up and come down

forever or does it go up and come down
 

8041
02:27:12,080 --> 02:27:13,750
forever or does it go up and come down
and burn up

and he said it many times he said this

8052
02:27:26,710 --> 02:27:26,720
and he said it many times he said this
 

8053
02:27:26,720 --> 02:27:28,550
and he said it many times he said this
is the the internet needs a native

8054
02:27:28,550 --> 02:27:28,560
is the the internet needs a native
 

8055
02:27:28,560 --> 02:27:31,910
is the the internet needs a native
currency yeah right and and

currency yeah right and and
 

8057
02:27:31,920 --> 02:27:35,349
currency yeah right and and
no political construct or security

8058

no political construct or security
 

8059
02:27:35,359 --> 02:27:37,670
no political construct or security
can be a native currency you need a

8060
02:27:37,670 --> 02:27:37,680
can be a native currency you need a
 

8061
02:27:37,680 --> 02:27:39,510
can be a native currency you need a
property and you need a property that

8062
02:27:39,510 --> 02:27:39,520
property and you need a property that
 

8063
02:27:39,520 --> 02:27:41,990

can be moved a million times a second
 

8065
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:44,870
can be moved a million times a second
can you oscillate it at 10 kilohertz or

8066
02:27:44,870 --> 02:27:44,880
can you oscillate it at 10 kilohertz or
 

8067
02:27:44,880 --> 02:27:46,070
can you oscillate it at 10 kilohertz or
100

8068

100
 

8069
02:27:46,080 --> 02:27:48,469
100
kilohertz and the answer is

8070
02:27:48,469 --> 02:27:48,479
kilohertz and the answer is
 

8071
02:27:48,479 --> 02:27:49,670
kilohertz and the answer is
only

8072
02:27:49,670 --> 02:27:49,680
only
 

8073
02:27:49,680 --> 02:27:52,870

right and and so
 

8285
02:31:51,280 --> 02:31:53,590
right and and so
now we get back to the ethical issue

8286
02:31:53,590 --> 02:31:53,600
now we get back to the ethical issue
 

8287
02:31:53,600 --> 02:31:56,790
now we get back to the ethical issue
well the the ethical issue is

8288
02:31:56,790 --> 02:31:56,800
well the the ethical issue is
 

8289
02:31:56,800 --> 02:31:58,790
well the the ethical issue is
if you're trading it as a commodity and

8290
02:31:58,790 --> 02:31:58,800
if you're trading it as a commodity and
 

8291
02:31:58,800 --> 02:32:01,190
if you're trading it as a commodity and
representing it as a commodity while

8292
02:32:01,190 --> 02:32:01,200
representing it as a commodity while
 

8293
02:32:01,200 --> 02:32:03,830
representing it as a commodity while
truthfully it's a security you know then

8294
02:32:03,830 --> 02:32:03,840
truthfully it's a security you know then
 

8295
02:32:03,840 --> 02:32:05,590
truthfully it's a security you know then
it's a violation of ethics rules and

8296
02:32:05,590 --> 02:32:05,600
it's a violation of ethics rules and
 

8297
02:32:05,600 --> 02:32:07,830
it's a violation of ethics rules and
it's probably illegal well you're you

8298
02:32:07,830 --> 02:32:07,840
it's probably illegal well you're you
 

8299

right and and that
 

8449
02:34:40,160 --> 02:34:42,630
right and and that
that's a matter of great debate right

8450
02:34:42,630 --> 02:34:42,640
that's a matter of great debate right
 

8451
02:34:42,640 --> 02:34:44,550
that's a matter of great debate right
now and um

8452
02:34:44,550 --> 02:34:44,560
now and um
 

8453
02:34:44,560 --> 02:34:46,150
now and um
so i think that that's part of the

8454
02:34:46,150 --> 02:34:46,160
so i think that that's part of the
 

8455
02:34:46,160 --> 02:34:48,309
so i think that that's part of the
debate but the other part of the debate

8456
02:34:48,309 --> 02:34:48,319
debate but the other part of the debate
 

8457
02:34:48,319 --> 02:34:51,270
debate but the other part of the debate
is

yeah if the head of the marine corps

8774
02:40:41,030 --> 02:40:41,040
yeah if the head of the marine corps
 

8775
02:40:41,040 --> 02:40:43,190
yeah if the head of the marine corps
started promoting anything that looked

8776
02:40:43,190 --> 02:40:43,200
started promoting anything that looked
 

8777
02:40:43,200 --> 02:40:45,030
started promoting anything that looked
like a security

8778

like a security
 

8779
02:40:45,040 --> 02:40:46,790
like a security
now if the head of the marine corps

02:40:46,790 --> 02:40:46,800
now if the head of the marine corps
 

8781
02:40:46,800 --> 02:40:50,070
now if the head of the marine corps
started promoting canoeing

8782
02:40:50,070 --> 02:40:50,080
started promoting canoeing

you might think he's kind of wacky like
 

8785
02:40:51,840 --> 02:40:52,710
you might think he's kind of wacky like

maybe
 

8787
02:40:52,720 --> 02:40:54,469
maybe
like that's kind of a waste of time a

8788
02:40:54,469 --> 02:40:54,479
like that's kind of a waste of time a
 

8789
02:40:54,479 --> 02:40:57,510
like that's kind of a waste of time a
distraction so but but

02:40:57,510 --> 02:40:57,520
distraction so but but
 

8791

ultimately the the issue of
 

8799
02:41:06,160 --> 02:41:08,710
ultimately the the issue of

not having a head one so is is it

8802
02:41:11,349 --> 02:41:11,359
not having a head one so is is it
 

8803
02:41:11,359 --> 02:41:13,429
not having a head one so is is it
something

can bitcoin

8806
02:41:15,190 --> 02:41:15,200
can bitcoin
 

8807
02:41:15,200 --> 02:41:17,670
can bitcoin
be replicated

so the all the things that you're saying
that make it a property can that be

that make it a property can that be

think the real fundamental issue is you
 

8833
02:41:44,000 --> 02:41:46,550
think the real fundamental issue is you
just never want it to change

a thousand years so i think satoshi said

8846
02:42:00,070 --> 02:42:00,080
a thousand years so i think satoshi said
 

8847
02:42:00,080 --> 02:42:01,670
a thousand years so i think satoshi said
it at one point he said the nature of

it at one point he said the nature of

it at one point he said the nature of

that's continually changing it you know

8856
02:42:11,990 --> 02:42:12,000
that's continually changing it you know
 

8857
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:15,110
that's continually changing it you know
on a routine basis it becomes harder and

8858

maybe you can speak to whether that's

02:43:28,469 --> 02:43:28,479
maybe you can speak to whether that's

maybe you can speak to whether that's
useful

useful
 

8927
02:43:29,600 --> 02:43:31,670
useful
but also i just like the psychology of

02:43:31,680 --> 02:43:33,349
but also i just like the psychology of
that to imagine that there's a human

that to imagine that there's a human

providence is really important and if i
 

8947
02:43:49,439 --> 02:43:51,910
providence is really important and if i
were to look at the highlighted points i

8948
02:43:51,910 --> 02:43:51,920
were to look at the highlighted points i
 

8949
02:43:51,920 --> 02:43:52,950
were to look at the highlighted points i
think

8950
02:43:52,950 --> 02:43:52,960
think
 

8951
02:43:52,960 --> 02:43:55,429
think
having a founder that was anonymous or

8952
02:43:55,429 --> 02:43:55,439
having a founder that was anonymous or
 

8953
02:43:55,439 --> 02:43:57,349
having a founder that was anonymous or
sit anonymous is important i think the

8954
02:43:57,349 --> 02:43:57,359
sit anonymous is important i think the
 

8955
02:43:57,359 --> 02:44:00,070
sit anonymous is important i think the
founder disappearing is also important i

8956
02:44:00,070 --> 02:44:00,080
founder disappearing is also important i
 

8957
02:44:00,080 --> 02:44:02,070
founder disappearing is also important i
think that the fact that the satoshi

8958
02:44:02,070 --> 02:44:02,080
think that the fact that the satoshi
 

8959
02:44:02,080 --> 02:44:05,510
think that the fact that the satoshi
coins never moved is also important

8960
02:44:05,510 --> 02:44:05,520
coins never moved is also important
 

8961
02:44:05,520 --> 02:44:07,990
coins never moved is also important
i think the the lack of an initial coin

8962
02:44:07,990 --> 02:44:08,000
i think the the lack of an initial coin
 

8963
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:10,550
i think the the lack of an initial coin
offering is also important i think the

8964
02:44:10,550 --> 02:44:10,560
offering is also important i think the
 

8965
02:44:10,560 --> 02:44:14,070
offering is also important i think the
lack of a corporate sponsor is important

8966
02:44:14,070 --> 02:44:14,080
lack of a corporate sponsor is important
 

8967
02:44:14,080 --> 02:44:16,550
lack of a corporate sponsor is important
i think the fact that it traded for 15

8968
02:44:16,550 --> 02:44:16,560
i think the fact that it traded for 15
 

8969
02:44:16,560 --> 02:44:19,510
i think the fact that it traded for 15
months with no commercial value

8970
02:44:19,510 --> 02:44:19,520
months with no commercial value
 

8971
02:44:19,520 --> 02:44:21,349
months with no commercial value
was also important

8972
02:44:21,349 --> 02:44:21,359
was also important
 

8973
02:44:21,359 --> 02:44:24,710
was also important
you know i i think that um

8974
02:44:24,710 --> 02:44:24,720
you know i i think that um
 

8975
02:44:24,720 --> 02:44:27,429
you know i i think that um
the simplicity of the protocol

8976
02:44:27,429 --> 02:44:27,439
the simplicity of the protocol
 

8977
02:44:27,439 --> 02:44:29,910
the simplicity of the protocol
and is very important i think that the

8978
02:44:29,910 --> 02:44:29,920
and is very important i think that the
 

8979
02:44:29,920 --> 02:44:31,990
and is very important i think that the
the outcome of the block size wars is

8980
02:44:31,990 --> 02:44:32,000
the outcome of the block size wars is
 

8981
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:36,309
the outcome of the block size wars is
very important and all of those things

8982
02:44:36,309 --> 02:44:36,319
very important and all of those things
 

8983
02:44:36,319 --> 02:44:38,309
very important and all of those things
add up to

8984
02:44:38,309 --> 02:44:38,319
add up to
 

8985
02:44:38,319 --> 02:44:39,990
add up to
common property they're they're all

8986
02:44:39,990 --> 02:44:40,000
common property they're they're all
 

8987

common property they're they're all
indicia indicators of a digital property

8988
02:44:43,269 --> 02:44:43,279
indicia indicators of a digital property

02:44:45,040 --> 02:44:47,349
as opposed to security
if there was a satoshi sitting around

8992
02:44:47,349 --> 02:44:47,359
if there was a satoshi sitting around
 

8993
02:44:47,359 --> 02:44:49,269
if there was a satoshi sitting around
sitting on top of

sitting on top of
 

8995
02:44:49,279 --> 02:44:51,670
sitting on top of
50 billion dollars worth of bitcoin it

8996
02:44:51,670 --> 02:44:51,680
50 billion dollars worth of bitcoin it
 

8997
02:44:51,680 --> 02:44:55,190
50 billion dollars worth of bitcoin it
would i don't think it would um

8998
02:44:55,190 --> 02:44:56,630
would i don't think it would um
 

8999
02:44:56,630 --> 02:44:56,640

 

9000
02:44:56,640 --> 02:44:58,630

bitcoin as property but i think it would

9001
02:44:58,630 --> 02:44:58,640
bitcoin as property but i think it would
 

9002
02:44:58,640 --> 02:45:00,790
bitcoin as property but i think it would
undermine

9003
02:45:00,790 --> 02:45:00,800
undermine
 

9004
02:45:00,800 --> 02:45:03,110
undermine
its digital property and if i wanted to

9005
02:45:03,110 --> 02:45:03,120
its digital property and if i wanted to
 

9006
02:45:03,120 --> 02:45:05,830
its digital property and if i wanted to
undermine a crypto asset network i would

9007
02:45:05,830 --> 02:45:05,840
undermine a crypto asset network i would
 

9008
02:45:05,840 --> 02:45:07,910
undermine a crypto asset network i would
do the opposite of all those things

9009
02:45:07,910 --> 02:45:07,920
do the opposite of all those things
 

9010
02:45:07,920 --> 02:45:10,389
do the opposite of all those things
i would launch one myself i would sell

9011
02:45:10,389 --> 02:45:10,399
i would launch one myself i would sell
 

9012
02:45:10,399 --> 02:45:13,510
i would launch one myself i would sell
25 or 50 percent of the general public i

9013
02:45:13,510 --> 02:45:13,520
25 or 50 percent of the general public i
 

9014
02:45:13,520 --> 02:45:15,429
25 or 50 percent of the general public i
would keep some of the initial i would

9015
02:45:15,429 --> 02:45:15,439
would keep some of the initial i would
 

9016
02:45:15,439 --> 02:45:17,830
would keep some of the initial i would
pre-mine some stuff or early mine it you

9017
02:45:17,830 --> 02:45:17,840
pre-mine some stuff or early mine it you
 

9018
02:45:17,840 --> 02:45:20,389
pre-mine some stuff or early mine it you
know and i would keep an influence on it

9019
02:45:20,389 --> 02:45:20,399
know and i would keep an influence on it
 

9020
02:45:20,399 --> 02:45:22,070
know and i would keep an influence on it
those are all

9021
02:45:22,070 --> 02:45:22,080
those are all
 

9022
02:45:22,080 --> 02:45:24,710
those are all
the opposite of what you would do in

9023
02:45:24,710 --> 02:45:24,720
the opposite of what you would do in
 

9024
02:45:24,720 --> 02:45:28,389
the opposite of what you would do in
order to create common property

9025
02:45:28,389 --> 02:45:28,399
order to create common property
 

9026
02:45:28,399 --> 02:45:31,110
order to create common property
and so i see the entire story is satoshi

9027
02:45:31,110 --> 02:45:31,120
and so i see the entire story is satoshi
 

9028
02:45:31,120 --> 02:45:32,950
and so i see the entire story is satoshi
giving a gift

9029
02:45:32,950 --> 02:45:32,960
giving a gift
 

9030
02:45:32,960 --> 02:45:35,030
giving a gift
of digital property

9031
02:45:35,030 --> 02:45:35,040
of digital property
 

9032
02:45:35,040 --> 02:45:36,870
of digital property
to the human race

9033
02:45:36,870 --> 02:45:36,880
to the human race
 

9034
02:45:36,880 --> 02:45:38,550
to the human race
and disappearing

9035
02:45:38,550 --> 02:45:38,560
and disappearing
 

9036
02:45:38,560 --> 02:45:40,230
and disappearing
do you think it was one person do you

9037
02:45:40,230 --> 02:45:40,240
do you think it was one person do you
 

9038
02:45:40,240 --> 02:45:42,870
do you think it was one person do you
have ideas of who it could be i

9039
02:45:42,870 --> 02:45:42,880
have ideas of who it could be i
 

9040
02:45:42,880 --> 02:45:45,670
have ideas of who it could be i
don't care to speculate

9041
02:45:45,670 --> 02:45:45,680
don't care to speculate
 

9042
02:45:45,680 --> 02:45:47,590
don't care to speculate
but do you think it was one person

9043
02:45:47,590 --> 02:45:47,600
but do you think it was one person
 

9044
02:45:47,600 --> 02:45:49,750
but do you think it was one person
like it was one person

9045
02:45:49,750 --> 02:45:49,760
like it was one person
 

9046
02:45:49,760 --> 02:45:51,349
like it was one person
maybe in conjunction with a bunch of

9047
02:45:51,349 --> 02:45:51,359
maybe in conjunction with a bunch of
 

9048
02:45:51,359 --> 02:45:52,950
maybe in conjunction with a bunch of
others i mean it might have been a group

9049
02:45:52,950 --> 02:45:52,960
others i mean it might have been a group
 

9050
02:45:52,960 --> 02:45:54,550
others i mean it might have been a group
of people that were working together but

9051
02:45:54,550 --> 02:45:54,560
of people that were working together but
 

9052
02:45:54,560 --> 02:45:56,469
of people that were working together but
certainly the there's a satoshi i mean

9053
02:45:56,469 --> 02:45:56,479
certainly the there's a satoshi i mean
 

9054
02:45:56,479 --> 02:45:58,630
certainly the there's a satoshi i mean
it's just so fascinating to me that one

9055
02:45:58,630 --> 02:45:58,640
it's just so fascinating to me that one
 

9056
02:45:58,640 --> 02:46:01,190
it's just so fascinating to me that one
person could be so brave

9057

person could be so brave
 

9058
02:46:01,200 --> 02:46:02,790
person could be so brave
and thoughtful or do you think a lot of

his accent like the block size wars the
 

9062
02:46:05,200 --> 02:46:08,469
his accent like the block size wars the
decision to make a block a certain size

9063

all the things you mentioned led up to
 

9066
02:46:10,479 --> 02:46:13,110
all the things you mentioned led up to
the characteristics that make bitcoin

do you think that's an accident

9071
02:46:16,870 --> 02:46:16,880
do you think that's an accident
 

9072
02:46:16,880 --> 02:46:19,190
do you think that's an accident
or it was deeply thought through

9073
02:46:19,190 --> 02:46:19,200
or it was deeply thought through
 

9074
02:46:19,200 --> 02:46:20,550

like how does this is almost like a

9075
02:46:20,550 --> 02:46:20,560
like how does this is almost like a
 

9076
02:46:20,560 --> 02:46:21,910
like how does this is almost like a
history of science questions people

9077
02:46:21,910 --> 02:46:21,920
history of science questions people
 

9078
02:46:21,920 --> 02:46:24,230
history of science questions people
tried it for they tried 40 of them right

9079
02:46:24,230 --> 02:46:24,240
tried it for they tried 40 of them right
 

9080
02:46:24,240 --> 02:46:25,750
tried it for they tried 40 of them right
i mean i i think there's a there's a

9081
02:46:25,750 --> 02:46:25,760
i mean i i think there's a there's a
 

9082
02:46:25,760 --> 02:46:27,269
i mean i i think there's a there's a
history of attempting to create

9083
02:46:27,269 --> 02:46:27,279
history of attempting to create
 

9084
02:46:27,279 --> 02:46:28,710
history of attempting to create
something like this and it was tried

9085
02:46:28,710 --> 02:46:28,720
something like this and it was tried
 

9086
02:46:28,720 --> 02:46:31,269
something like this and it was tried
many many times and and they failed for

9087
02:46:31,269 --> 02:46:31,279
many many times and and they failed for
 

9088
02:46:31,279 --> 02:46:33,670
many many times and and they failed for
different reasons and i think that

9089
02:46:33,670 --> 02:46:33,680
different reasons and i think that
 

9090
02:46:33,680 --> 02:46:35,349
different reasons and i think that
it's like prometheus tried to start a

9091
02:46:35,349 --> 02:46:35,359
it's like prometheus tried to start a
 

9092
02:46:35,359 --> 02:46:37,910
it's like prometheus tried to start a
fire 47 times and maybe the 48th time

9093
02:46:37,910 --> 02:46:37,920
fire 47 times and maybe the 48th time
 

9094
02:46:37,920 --> 02:46:39,269
fire 47 times and maybe the 48th time
it's sparked

9095
02:46:39,269 --> 02:46:39,279
it's sparked
 

9096
02:46:39,279 --> 02:46:41,030
it's sparked
and and that's how i see this this is

9097
02:46:41,030 --> 02:46:41,040
and and that's how i see this this is
 

9098
02:46:41,040 --> 02:46:43,910
and and that's how i see this this is
the first one that's sparked

9099
02:46:43,910 --> 02:46:43,920
the first one that's sparked
 

9100
02:46:43,920 --> 02:46:46,389
the first one that's sparked
and uh and it sets a road map for us and

9101
02:46:46,389 --> 02:46:46,399
and uh and it sets a road map for us and
 

9102
02:46:46,399 --> 02:46:48,630
and uh and it sets a road map for us and
i and i think

9103
02:46:48,630 --> 02:46:48,640
i and i think
 

9104
02:46:48,640 --> 02:46:51,510
i and i think
if you're looking for any one word that

9105
02:46:51,510 --> 02:46:51,520
if you're looking for any one word that
 

9106
02:46:51,520 --> 02:46:53,910
if you're looking for any one word that
it's fair the whole point of the network

9107
02:46:53,910 --> 02:46:53,920
it's fair the whole point of the network
 

9108
02:46:53,920 --> 02:46:56,309
it's fair the whole point of the network
is it's a fair launch of fair

9109
02:46:56,309 --> 02:46:56,319
is it's a fair launch of fair
 

9110
02:46:56,319 --> 02:46:58,150
is it's a fair launch of fair
distribution

9111
02:46:58,150 --> 02:46:58,160
distribution
 

9112
02:46:58,160 --> 02:46:59,030
distribution
like

9113
02:46:59,030 --> 02:46:59,040
like
 

9114
02:46:59,040 --> 02:47:00,150
like
yeah

9115
02:47:00,150 --> 02:47:00,160
yeah
 

9116
02:47:00,160 --> 02:47:03,750
yeah
i have bitcoin but i bought it

9117
02:47:03,750 --> 02:47:03,760
i have bitcoin but i bought it
 

9118
02:47:03,760 --> 02:47:06,469
i have bitcoin but i bought it
in fact you know at this point we've

9119
02:47:06,469 --> 02:47:06,479
in fact you know at this point we've
 

9120
02:47:06,479 --> 02:47:09,349
in fact you know at this point we've
paid four billion dollars of you real

9121
02:47:09,349 --> 02:47:09,359
paid four billion dollars of you real
 

9122
02:47:09,359 --> 02:47:10,950
paid four billion dollars of you real
cash to buy it

9123
02:47:10,950 --> 02:47:10,960
cash to buy it
 

9124
02:47:10,960 --> 02:47:14,630
cash to buy it
if if i was sitting on the same position

9125
02:47:14,630 --> 02:47:14,640
if if i was sitting on the same position
 

9126
02:47:14,640 --> 02:47:16,389
if if i was sitting on the same position
and i had it for free

9127
02:47:16,389 --> 02:47:16,399
and i had it for free
 

9128
02:47:16,399 --> 02:47:18,870
and i had it for free
then there's always this question of

9129
02:47:18,870 --> 02:47:18,880
then there's always this question of
 

9130
02:47:18,880 --> 02:47:20,389
then there's always this question of
did i pay you know or i bought it for a

9131
02:47:20,389 --> 02:47:20,399
did i pay you know or i bought it for a
 

9132
02:47:20,399 --> 02:47:22,309
did i pay you know or i bought it for a
nickel a coin or a penny a coin the

9133
02:47:22,309 --> 02:47:22,319
nickel a coin or a penny a coin the
 

9134
02:47:22,319 --> 02:47:24,870
nickel a coin or a penny a coin the
question is was it fair and and that's a

9135
02:47:24,870 --> 02:47:24,880
question is was it fair and and that's a
 

9136
02:47:24,880 --> 02:47:27,349
question is was it fair and and that's a
very hard question to answer

9137
02:47:27,349 --> 02:47:27,359
very hard question to answer
 

9138
02:47:27,359 --> 02:47:29,830
very hard question to answer
right did you acquire the bitcoin that

9139
02:47:29,830 --> 02:47:29,840
right did you acquire the bitcoin that
 

9140
02:47:29,840 --> 02:47:32,150
right did you acquire the bitcoin that
you own fairly

9141
02:47:32,150 --> 02:47:32,160
you own fairly
 

9142
02:47:32,160 --> 02:47:34,469
you own fairly
and if you roll the clock back you know

9143
02:47:34,469 --> 02:47:34,479
and if you roll the clock back you know
 

9144
02:47:34,479 --> 02:47:36,309
and if you roll the clock back you know
you could have bought it for a nickel or

9145
02:47:36,309 --> 02:47:36,319
you could have bought it for a nickel or
 

9146
02:47:36,319 --> 02:47:38,070
you could have bought it for a nickel or
a dime but that was when it was a

9147
02:47:38,070 --> 02:47:38,080
a dime but that was when it was a
 

9148
02:47:38,080 --> 02:47:40,710
a dime but that was when it was a
million times more likely to fail

9149
02:47:40,710 --> 02:47:40,720
million times more likely to fail
 

9150
02:47:40,720 --> 02:47:43,349
million times more likely to fail
right when the risk was greater the cost

9151
02:47:43,349 --> 02:47:43,359
right when the risk was greater the cost
 

9152
02:47:43,359 --> 02:47:46,710
right when the risk was greater the cost
was lower and then over time the risk

9153
02:47:46,710 --> 02:47:46,720
was lower and then over time the risk
 

9154
02:47:46,720 --> 02:47:50,150
was lower and then over time the risk
became lower and the cost became greater

9155
02:47:50,150 --> 02:47:50,160
became lower and the cost became greater
 

9156
02:47:50,160 --> 02:47:53,269
became lower and the cost became greater
and the real critical thing was to allow

you know it's a lindy thing right you

you know it's a lindy thing right you
 

9236
02:49:22,319 --> 02:49:24,630
you know it's a lindy thing right you
wait 13 years to see if it'll be hacked

9237
02:49:24,630 --> 02:49:24,640
wait 13 years to see if it'll be hacked
 

9238
02:49:24,640 --> 02:49:26,630
wait 13 years to see if it'll be hacked
but on the other hand

9239
02:49:26,630 --> 02:49:26,640
but on the other hand
 

9240
02:49:26,640 --> 02:49:28,150
but on the other hand
with a billion dollars it's not as

9241
02:49:28,150 --> 02:49:28,160
with a billion dollars it's not as
 

9242
02:49:28,160 --> 02:49:29,910
with a billion dollars it's not as
interesting a target as it is with a

9243
02:49:29,910 --> 02:49:29,920
interesting a target as it is with a
 

9244
02:49:29,920 --> 02:49:31,750
interesting a target as it is with a
hundred billion and when it gets to be

9245
02:49:31,750 --> 02:49:31,760
hundred billion and when it gets to be
 

9246
02:49:31,760 --> 02:49:33,429
hundred billion and when it gets to be
worth a trillion

9247
02:49:33,429 --> 02:49:33,439
worth a trillion
 

9248
02:49:33,439 --> 02:49:35,830
worth a trillion
then it's a bigger target so

9249
02:49:35,830 --> 02:49:35,840
then it's a bigger target so
 

9250
02:49:35,840 --> 02:49:39,590
then it's a bigger target so
so the risk has been bleeding off over

9251
02:49:39,590 --> 02:49:39,600
so the risk has been bleeding off over
 

9252
02:49:39,600 --> 02:49:43,190
so the risk has been bleeding off over
time as the network monetized

9253
02:49:43,190 --> 02:49:43,200
time as the network monetized
 

9254
02:49:43,200 --> 02:49:45,190
time as the network monetized
i think the second question is will it

02:49:45,190 --> 02:49:45,200
i think the second question is will it
 

9256
02:49:45,200 --> 02:49:46,550
i think the second question is will it
be banned

02:50:03,750 --> 02:50:03,760
in 2014 the irs um designated it as
 

9274
02:50:03,760 --> 02:50:05,349
in 2014 the irs um designated it as

9276
02:50:05,359 --> 02:50:07,429
property and gave it property tax
treatment okay so

9277
02:50:07,429 --> 02:50:07,439
treatment okay so
 

9278
02:50:07,439 --> 02:50:09,190
treatment okay so
they they could have given it a tax

9279
02:50:09,190 --> 02:50:09,200
they they could have given it a tax
 

9280
02:50:09,200 --> 02:50:11,269
they they could have given it a tax
treatment where you had to pay tax on on

02:50:11,269 --> 02:50:11,279
treatment where you had to pay tax on on
 

9282

the unrealized capital gains
 

9284
02:50:13,920 --> 02:50:15,429
the unrealized capital gains
every year and it probably would have

9285
02:50:15,429 --> 02:50:15,439
every year and it probably would have
 

9286
02:50:15,439 --> 02:50:17,190
every year and it probably would have
crushed it to death

9287
02:50:17,190 --> 02:50:17,200
crushed it to death
 

9288
02:50:17,200 --> 02:50:19,030
crushed it to death
right you know so

9289
02:50:19,030 --> 02:50:19,040
right you know so
 

9290
02:50:19,040 --> 02:50:21,510
right you know so
so it could have been in any

9291
02:50:21,510 --> 02:50:21,520
so it could have been in any
 

9292
02:50:21,520 --> 02:50:24,070
so it could have been in any
in any number of places banned by a

9293
02:50:24,070 --> 02:50:24,080
in any number of places banned by a
 

9294
02:50:24,080 --> 02:50:25,830
in any number of places banned by a
government but in fact it was

9295
02:50:25,830 --> 02:50:25,840
government but in fact it was
 

9296
02:50:25,840 --> 02:50:28,230
government but in fact it was
legitimized as property

9297
02:50:28,230 --> 02:50:28,240
legitimized as property
 

9298
02:50:28,240 --> 02:50:29,510
legitimized as property
and then the questions would it be

9299
02:50:29,510 --> 02:50:29,520
and then the questions would it be
 

9300
02:50:29,520 --> 02:50:31,030
and then the questions would it be
hacked or would it be copied well it'd

9301
02:50:31,030 --> 02:50:31,040
hacked or would it be copied well it'd
 

9302
02:50:31,040 --> 02:50:32,469
hacked or would it be copied well it'd
be something better than that and it was

9303
02:50:32,469 --> 02:50:32,479
be something better than that and it was
 

9304
02:50:32,479 --> 02:50:35,190
be something better than that and it was
copied 15 000 times and you know the

9305
02:50:35,190 --> 02:50:35,200
copied 15 000 times and you know the
 

9306
02:50:35,200 --> 02:50:37,429
copied 15 000 times and you know the
story of all those and

9307
02:50:37,429 --> 02:50:37,439
story of all those and
 

9308
02:50:37,439 --> 02:50:39,830
story of all those and
and they either diverge to be something

9309
02:50:39,830 --> 02:50:39,840
and they either diverge to be something
 

9310
02:50:39,840 --> 02:50:42,870
and they either diverge to be something
totally different and not comparable or

9311
02:50:42,870 --> 02:50:42,880
totally different and not comparable or
 

9312
02:50:42,880 --> 02:50:44,790
totally different and not comparable or
someone trying to copy

9313
02:50:44,790 --> 02:50:44,800
someone trying to copy
 

9314
02:50:44,800 --> 02:50:47,269

a non-sovereign bearer instrument store
of value found that the their networks

9317
02:50:49,670 --> 02:50:49,680
of value found that the their networks
 

9318
02:50:49,680 --> 02:50:51,190
of value found that the their networks
crashed to be one percent of what

9319
02:50:51,190 --> 02:50:51,200
crashed to be one percent of what

bitcoin is so

9321
02:50:53,349 --> 02:50:53,359
bitcoin is so
 

9322
02:50:53,359 --> 02:50:55,190
bitcoin is so
now we're sitting

9323

now we're sitting
 

9324
02:50:55,200 --> 02:50:57,269
now we're sitting
at a point where all those risks are out

9325
02:50:57,269 --> 02:50:57,279
at a point where all those risks are out
 

9326
02:50:57,279 --> 02:50:59,030
at a point where all those risks are out
of the out of the way

9327
02:50:59,030 --> 02:50:59,040
of the out of the way
 

9328
02:50:59,040 --> 02:51:00,469
of the out of the way
i would say that year one of

9329
02:51:00,469 --> 02:51:00,479
i would say that year one of
 

9330
02:51:00,479 --> 02:51:02,630
i would say that year one of
institutional adoption

9331
02:51:02,630 --> 02:51:02,640
institutional adoption
 

9332
02:51:02,640 --> 02:51:04,950
institutional adoption
is uh it started august

9333
02:51:04,950 --> 02:51:04,960
is uh it started august
 

9334
02:51:04,960 --> 02:51:07,269
is uh it started august
2020 that's when microstrategy bought

9335
02:51:07,269 --> 02:51:07,279
2020 that's when microstrategy bought
 

9336
02:51:07,279 --> 02:51:09,349
2020 that's when microstrategy bought
250 million dollars worth of bitcoin and

9337
02:51:09,349 --> 02:51:09,359
250 million dollars worth of bitcoin and
 

9338
02:51:09,359 --> 02:51:11,349
250 million dollars worth of bitcoin and
we put that on the wire we were the

9339
02:51:11,349 --> 02:51:11,359
we put that on the wire we were the
 

9340
02:51:11,359 --> 02:51:13,030
we put that on the wire we were the
first publicly traded company to

9341
02:51:13,030 --> 02:51:13,040
first publicly traded company to
 

9342
02:51:13,040 --> 02:51:14,230
first publicly traded company to

uh
 

9346
02:51:15,120 --> 02:51:16,389
uh
bitcoin i don't think you could have

9347
02:51:16,389 --> 02:51:16,399
bitcoin i don't think you could have
 

9348

found a five million dollar purchase
 

9350
02:51:17,760 --> 02:51:20,469
found a five million dollar purchase
from a public company before we did that

9351
02:51:20,469 --> 02:51:20,479
from a public company before we did that
 

9352
02:51:20,479 --> 02:51:23,590
from a public company before we did that
so that was kind of like a gun going off

9353
02:51:23,590 --> 02:51:23,600
so that was kind of like a gun going off
 

9354
02:51:23,600 --> 02:51:26,389
so that was kind of like a gun going off
and then in the next 12 months

9355
02:51:26,389 --> 02:51:26,399
and then in the next 12 months
 

9356
02:51:26,399 --> 02:51:28,870
and then in the next 12 months
tesla bought bitcoin square bought

bitcoin and i'd say now we're in year

9359
02:51:31,190 --> 02:51:31,200
bitcoin and i'd say now we're in year
 

9360
02:51:31,200 --> 02:51:34,309
bitcoin and i'd say now we're in year
two of institutional adoption and uh

9361

two of institutional adoption and uh
 

9362
02:51:34,319 --> 02:51:36,950
two of institutional adoption and uh
about 24 should be 24 publicly traded

9363
02:51:36,950 --> 02:51:36,960
about 24 should be 24 publicly traded
 

9364

so i i would say the asset

9391
02:52:04,710 --> 02:52:04,720
so i i would say the asset
 

9392
02:52:04,720 --> 02:52:07,670
so i i would say the asset
decade one was entrepreneurial

9393
02:52:07,670 --> 02:52:07,680
decade one was entrepreneurial
 

9394
02:52:07,680 --> 02:52:10,870
decade one was entrepreneurial
experimental

9395

9396
02:52:10,880 --> 02:52:13,190

decade two is a rotation from

9397
02:52:13,190 --> 02:52:13,200
decade two is a rotation from
 

9398
02:52:13,200 --> 02:52:15,429
decade two is a rotation from
entrepreneurs institutions and is

9399
02:52:15,429 --> 02:52:15,439
entrepreneurs institutions and is
 

9400
02:52:15,439 --> 02:52:17,349
entrepreneurs institutions and is
becoming institutionalized so maybe

9401
02:52:17,349 --> 02:52:17,359
becoming institutionalized so maybe
 

9402
02:52:17,359 --> 02:52:18,790
becoming institutionalized so maybe
decade one you go from zero to a

9403
02:52:18,790 --> 02:52:18,800
decade one you go from zero to a
 

9404
02:52:18,800 --> 02:52:20,469
decade one you go from zero to a
trillion and a decade two you go from

9405
02:52:20,469 --> 02:52:20,479
trillion and a decade two you go from
 

9406
02:52:20,479 --> 02:52:22,790
trillion and a decade two you go from
one trillion to a hundred trillion what

9407

uh all that kind of stuff is that
 

9424
02:52:38,240 --> 02:52:41,190
uh all that kind of stuff is that
important and if if it is when when will

9425
02:52:41,190 --> 02:52:41,200
important and if if it is when when will
 

9426
02:52:41,200 --> 02:52:42,710
important and if if it is when when will
it happen

9427
02:52:42,710 --> 02:52:42,720
it happen
 

9428
02:52:42,720 --> 02:52:44,630
it happen
it's not essential for the success of

9429
02:52:44,630 --> 02:52:44,640
it's not essential for the success of
 

9430
02:52:44,640 --> 02:52:46,950
it's not essential for the success of
the asset class but i think it's it's

9431
02:52:46,950 --> 02:52:46,960
the asset class but i think it's it's
 

9432
02:52:46,960 --> 02:52:50,870
the asset class but i think it's it's
inevitable in various degrees over time

9433
02:52:50,870 --> 02:52:50,880
inevitable in various degrees over time
 

9434
02:52:50,880 --> 02:52:53,590
inevitable in various degrees over time
but the most likely thing to happen next

9435
02:52:53,590 --> 02:52:53,600
but the most likely thing to happen next
 

9436
02:52:53,600 --> 02:52:55,349
but the most likely thing to happen next
is um

9437
02:52:55,349 --> 02:52:55,359
is um
 

9438
02:52:55,359 --> 02:52:58,710
is um

that
and the government entities most likely

and the government entities most likely
 

9452
02:53:10,319 --> 02:53:11,429
and the government entities most likely
to be involved with that would be

you know not not far removed from that
 

9470
02:53:28,960 --> 02:53:31,670

that's a non-controversial

i think there are there are

i think there are there are
opportunities for governments that are

9477
02:53:37,429 --> 02:53:37,439
opportunities for governments that are
 

9478
02:53:37,439 --> 02:53:41,030
opportunities for governments that are
much more profound right if a government

9479
02:53:41,030 --> 02:53:41,040
much more profound right if a government
 

9480
02:53:41,040 --> 02:53:42,710
much more profound right if a government
started to adopt

bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset

9483
02:53:46,550 --> 02:53:46,560
bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset
 

9484
02:53:46,560 --> 02:53:48,790
bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset
that's much bigger than just a

9485
02:53:48,790 --> 02:53:48,800
that's much bigger than just a
 

9486
02:53:48,800 --> 02:53:53,190
that's much bigger than just a
an asset investment that's 100 x bigger

9487
02:53:53,190 --> 02:53:53,200
an asset investment that's 100 x bigger
 

9488
02:53:53,200 --> 02:53:55,349
an asset investment that's 100 x bigger
and you could imagine that's like a

9489
02:53:55,349 --> 02:53:55,359
and you could imagine that's like a
 

9490
02:53:55,359 --> 02:53:57,510
and you could imagine that's like a
trillion dollar opportunity like any

9491
02:53:57,510 --> 02:53:57,520
trillion dollar opportunity like any
 

9492
02:53:57,520 --> 02:53:59,510
trillion dollar opportunity like any
government that wanted to adopt it as a

government that wanted to adopt it as a
 

9494
02:53:59,520 --> 02:54:01,590
government that wanted to adopt it as a
treasury reserve asset would probably

9495
02:54:01,590 --> 02:54:01,600
treasury reserve asset would probably
 

9496
02:54:01,600 --> 02:54:04,309
treasury reserve asset would probably
generate trillions of dollars a trillion

9497
02:54:04,309 --> 02:54:04,319
generate trillions of dollars a trillion
 

9498
02:54:04,319 --> 02:54:07,990
generate trillions of dollars a trillion
or more of value and then you know the

9499
02:54:07,990 --> 02:54:08,000
or more of value and then you know the
 

9500
02:54:08,000 --> 02:54:09,990
or more of value and then you know the
thing that people think about is well

9501
02:54:09,990 --> 02:54:10,000
thing that people think about is well
 

9502
02:54:10,000 --> 02:54:13,269
thing that people think about is well
will oil ever be priced in bitcoin

9503
02:54:13,269 --> 02:54:13,279
will oil ever be priced in bitcoin
 

9504
02:54:13,279 --> 02:54:16,070
will oil ever be priced in bitcoin
or any other export commodity

9505
02:54:16,070 --> 02:54:16,080
or any other export commodity
 

9506
02:54:16,080 --> 02:54:17,750
or any other export commodity
i think there's like 1.8 trillion

9507
02:54:17,750 --> 02:54:17,760
i think there's like 1.8 trillion
 

9508
02:54:17,760 --> 02:54:21,110
i think there's like 1.8 trillion
dollars or more of export commodities

9509
02:54:21,110 --> 02:54:21,120
dollars or more of export commodities
 

9510
02:54:21,120 --> 02:54:22,550
dollars or more of export commodities
in the world and right now they're all

02:54:22,550 --> 02:54:22,560
in the world and right now they're all
 

9512
02:54:22,560 --> 02:54:24,950
in the world and right now they're all
priced in dollars i i think that this is

9513
02:54:24,950 --> 02:54:24,960
priced in dollars i i think that this is
 

9514
02:54:24,960 --> 02:54:26,710
priced in dollars i i think that this is
a colorful thing but it's not really

02:54:26,710 --> 02:54:26,720
a colorful thing but it's not really
 

9516
02:54:26,720 --> 02:54:29,190
a colorful thing but it's not really
that relevant like you could sell all

that relevant like you could sell all
 

9518
02:54:29,200 --> 02:54:31,670
that relevant like you could sell all
that stuff in dollars that the relevant

is what's your treasury reserve asset
 

9528
02:54:41,120 --> 02:54:43,110
is what's your treasury reserve asset
and if your treasury reserve asset is

02:54:50,479 --> 02:54:51,429
losing 20 or 30 of its value a year
then

9535
02:54:51,429 --> 02:54:51,439
then
 

9536
02:54:51,439 --> 02:54:53,510
then
you know your your balance sheet is

9537
02:54:53,510 --> 02:54:53,520
you know your your balance sheet is
 

9538
02:54:53,520 --> 02:54:55,510
you know your your balance sheet is
collapsing

9539
02:54:55,510 --> 02:54:55,520
collapsing
 

9540
02:54:55,520 --> 02:54:57,110
collapsing
within five years

within five years
 

9542
02:54:57,120 --> 02:54:59,750

and if the treasury reserve asset is uh
 

9544
02:54:59,760 --> 02:55:01,670
and if the treasury reserve asset is uh
is dollars and

9545
02:55:01,670 --> 02:55:01,680
is dollars and
 

9546
02:55:01,680 --> 02:55:05,190

currency derivatives and u.s treasuries
 

9548
02:55:05,200 --> 02:55:07,269
currency derivatives and u.s treasuries
then you're getting your

9549
02:55:07,269 --> 02:55:07,279
then you're getting your
 

9550
02:55:07,279 --> 02:55:09,910
then you're getting your
seven right now it's probably 15 percent

9551
02:55:09,910 --> 02:55:09,920
seven right now it's probably 15 percent
 

9552

or more
 

9554
02:55:11,520 --> 02:55:13,510
or more
uh monetary inflation we're running

9555
02:55:13,510 --> 02:55:13,520
uh monetary inflation we're running
 

9556
02:55:13,520 --> 02:55:15,750
uh monetary inflation we're running
double the historic average you could

9557
02:55:15,750 --> 02:55:15,760
double the historic average you could
 

9558
02:55:15,760 --> 02:55:17,349
double the historic average you could
argue triple somewhere between double

9559
02:55:17,349 --> 02:55:17,359
argue triple somewhere between double
 

9560
02:55:17,359 --> 02:55:19,510
argue triple somewhere between double
and triple depending upon

and triple depending upon
 

9562
02:55:19,520 --> 02:55:21,349

what your metric is
 

9564
02:55:21,359 --> 02:55:23,269
what your metric is
so you know do i think it'll happen i

9565
02:55:23,269 --> 02:55:23,279
so you know do i think it'll happen i
 

9566
02:55:23,279 --> 02:55:24,870
so you know do i think it'll happen i
think that they're conservative but they

9567
02:55:24,870 --> 02:55:24,880
think that they're conservative but they
 

9568
02:55:24,880 --> 02:55:26,550
think that they're conservative but they
have to be shocked and i think there is

9569
02:55:26,550 --> 02:55:26,560
have to be shocked and i think there is
 

9570
02:55:26,560 --> 02:55:28,150
have to be shocked and i think there is
a shock

their banks
 

9650
02:56:53,120 --> 02:56:55,269
their banks
i think the

ukraine war
was a second shock but i think that the

was a second shock but i think that the
 

9656
02:57:00,080 --> 02:57:04,309
was a second shock but i think that the
russian sanctions was a third shock

9657

think hyperinflation in the rest of the

9661

think hyperinflation in the rest of the
 

9662
02:57:09,359 --> 02:57:11,030
think hyperinflation in the rest of the
world is a fourth shock and then

9663
02:57:11,030 --> 02:57:11,040
world is a fourth shock and then
 

9664
02:57:11,040 --> 02:57:13,190
world is a fourth shock and then
persistent inflation the us is a fifth

9665
02:57:13,190 --> 02:57:13,200
persistent inflation the us is a fifth
 

9666
02:57:13,200 --> 02:57:14,550
persistent inflation the us is a fifth
shock

9667

shock
 

9668
02:57:14,560 --> 02:57:17,269
shock
so i think it's a perfect storm

9669
02:57:17,269 --> 02:57:17,279
so i think it's a perfect storm
 

9670
02:57:17,279 --> 02:57:20,469
so i think it's a perfect storm
and if you put all these events together

and you can see that happening like

9845
03:00:29,990 --> 03:00:30,000
and you can see that happening like
 

9846
03:00:30,000 --> 03:00:31,750
and you can see that happening like
we've gone from 5 billion in stable

9847

months yeah so i do think there's

9851
03:00:37,429 --> 03:00:37,439
months yeah so i do think there's
 

9852
03:00:37,439 --> 03:00:39,349
months yeah so i do think there's
massive demand

9853
03:00:39,349 --> 03:00:39,359
massive demand
 

9854
03:00:39,359 --> 03:00:42,710

03:00:42,720 --> 03:00:45,750
for uh crypto dollars in the form of a
us dollar asset and there's

9857
03:00:45,750 --> 03:00:45,760
us dollar asset and there's
 

9858
03:00:45,760 --> 03:00:47,590
us dollar asset and there's
and everybody in the world would say

9859
03:00:47,590 --> 03:00:47,600
and everybody in the world would say
 

9860
03:00:47,600 --> 03:00:49,510

03:01:19,600 --> 03:01:22,309
it's going to climb in a serpentine
fashion it's going to advance and come

9893
03:01:22,309 --> 03:01:22,319
fashion it's going to advance and come
 

9894
03:01:22,319 --> 03:01:24,790
fashion it's going to advance and come
back and it's going to keep

9895
03:01:24,790 --> 03:01:24,800
back and it's going to keep
 

9896
03:01:24,800 --> 03:01:26,550
back and it's going to keep
it's going to keep climbing

9897
03:01:26,550 --> 03:01:26,560
it's going to keep climbing
 

9898
03:01:26,560 --> 03:01:29,030
it's going to keep climbing
i think that the volatility attracts all

9899
03:01:29,030 --> 03:01:29,040
i think that the volatility attracts all
 

9900
03:01:29,040 --> 03:01:32,150
i think that the volatility attracts all
the capital into the marketplace and so

9901
03:01:32,150 --> 03:01:32,160
the capital into the marketplace and so
 

9902
03:01:32,160 --> 03:01:34,230
the capital into the marketplace and so
the volatility makes it the most

9903
03:01:34,230 --> 03:01:34,240
the volatility makes it the most
 

9904
03:01:34,240 --> 03:01:35,830
the volatility makes it the most
interesting thing in the financial

9905
03:01:35,830 --> 03:01:35,840
interesting thing in the financial
 

9906
03:01:35,840 --> 03:01:38,790
interesting thing in the financial
universe it also generates massive yield

9907
03:01:38,790 --> 03:01:38,800
universe it also generates massive yield
 

9908
03:01:38,800 --> 03:01:41,990
universe it also generates massive yield
and massive returns for traders

9909
03:01:41,990 --> 03:01:42,000
and massive returns for traders
 

9910
03:01:42,000 --> 03:01:44,070
and massive returns for traders
and that attracts capital like we're

9911
03:01:44,070 --> 03:01:44,080
and that attracts capital like we're
 

9912
03:01:44,080 --> 03:01:45,830
and that attracts capital like we're
talking about the difference between

9913
03:01:45,830 --> 03:01:45,840
talking about the difference between
 

9914
03:01:45,840 --> 03:01:49,110
talking about the difference between
five percent return and 500 return

9915
03:01:49,110 --> 03:01:49,120
five percent return and 500 return
 

9916
03:01:49,120 --> 03:01:50,790
five percent return and 500 return
so

9917
03:01:50,790 --> 03:01:50,800
so
 

9918
03:01:50,800 --> 03:01:53,030
so
the fast money is attracted by the

9919
03:01:53,030 --> 03:01:53,040
the fast money is attracted by the
 

9920
03:01:53,040 --> 03:01:54,950
the fast money is attracted by the
volatility

9921
03:01:54,950 --> 03:01:54,960
volatility
 

9922
03:01:54,960 --> 03:01:57,349
volatility
the volatility's been decreasing year by

9923
03:01:57,349 --> 03:01:57,359
the volatility's been decreasing year by
 

9924
03:01:57,359 --> 03:02:00,630
the volatility's been decreasing year by
year by year i think that um that it's

9925
03:02:00,630 --> 03:02:00,640
year by year i think that um that it's
 

9926
03:02:00,640 --> 03:02:02,309
year by year i think that um that it's
stabilizing

9927
03:02:02,309 --> 03:02:02,319
stabilizing
 

9928
03:02:02,319 --> 03:02:03,510
stabilizing
i don't think we'll see as much

9929
03:02:03,510 --> 03:02:03,520
i don't think we'll see as much
 

9930
03:02:03,520 --> 03:02:05,110
i don't think we'll see as much
volatility in the future as we have in

9931
03:02:05,110 --> 03:02:05,120
volatility in the future as we have in
 

9932
03:02:05,120 --> 03:02:06,630
volatility in the future as we have in
the past

9933
03:02:06,630 --> 03:02:06,640
the past
 

9934
03:02:06,640 --> 03:02:08,110
the past
i think that um

9935
03:02:08,110 --> 03:02:08,120
i think that um
 

9936
03:02:08,120 --> 03:02:09,190
i think that um

digital gold you know the market cap

9941
03:02:15,429 --> 03:02:15,439
digital gold you know the market cap
 

9942
03:02:15,439 --> 03:02:18,230
digital gold you know the market cap
goes to between 10 and 20 trillion

9943
03:02:18,230 --> 03:02:18,240
goes to between 10 and 20 trillion
 

9944
03:02:18,240 --> 03:02:19,269
goes to between 10 and 20 trillion
but

9945
03:02:19,269 --> 03:02:19,279
but
 

9946
03:02:19,279 --> 03:02:22,469
but
gold is remember gold is is defective

9947
03:02:22,469 --> 03:02:22,479
gold is remember gold is is defective
 

9948
03:02:22,479 --> 03:02:24,710
gold is remember gold is is defective
property gold is dead money

9949
03:02:24,710 --> 03:02:24,720
property gold is dead money
 

9950
03:02:24,720 --> 03:02:26,150
property gold is dead money
you have a billion dollars of gold that

9951
03:02:26,150 --> 03:02:26,160
you have a billion dollars of gold that
 

9952
03:02:26,160 --> 03:02:28,070
you have a billion dollars of gold that
says in a vault for a decade it's very

9953
03:02:28,070 --> 03:02:28,080
says in a vault for a decade it's very
 

9954
03:02:28,080 --> 03:02:30,389
says in a vault for a decade it's very
hard to mortgage the gold it's also very

9955
03:02:30,389 --> 03:02:30,399
hard to mortgage the gold it's also very
 

9956
03:02:30,399 --> 03:02:32,790
hard to mortgage the gold it's also very
hard to rent the gold you can't loan the

9957
03:02:32,790 --> 03:02:32,800
hard to rent the gold you can't loan the
 

9958
03:02:32,800 --> 03:02:35,190
hard to rent the gold you can't loan the
gold no one's going to create a business

9959
03:02:35,190 --> 03:02:35,200
gold no one's going to create a business
 

9960
03:02:35,200 --> 03:02:36,469
gold no one's going to create a business
with your gold

9961
03:02:36,469 --> 03:02:36,479
with your gold
 

9962
03:02:36,479 --> 03:02:38,950
with your gold
so gold that doesn't generate much of a

9963
03:02:38,950 --> 03:02:38,960
so gold that doesn't generate much of a
 

9964
03:02:38,960 --> 03:02:40,710
so gold that doesn't generate much of a
yield so for that reason most people

9965
03:02:40,710 --> 03:02:40,720
yield so for that reason most people
 

9966
03:02:40,720 --> 03:02:42,389
yield so for that reason most people
wouldn't store a billion dollars for a

9967
03:02:42,389 --> 03:02:42,399
wouldn't store a billion dollars for a
 

9968
03:02:42,399 --> 03:02:43,910
wouldn't store a billion dollars for a
decade in gold they would buy a billion

9969
03:02:43,910 --> 03:02:43,920
decade in gold they would buy a billion
 

9970
03:02:43,920 --> 03:02:45,830
decade in gold they would buy a billion
dollars of commercial real estate

9971
03:02:45,830 --> 03:02:45,840
dollars of commercial real estate
 

9972
03:02:45,840 --> 03:02:47,110
dollars of commercial real estate
property

9973
03:02:47,110 --> 03:02:47,120
property
 

9974
03:02:47,120 --> 03:02:49,590
property
and the reason why is because i can rent

9975
03:02:49,590 --> 03:02:49,600
and the reason why is because i can rent
 

9976
03:02:49,600 --> 03:02:52,150
and the reason why is because i can rent
it and generate a yield on it that's in

9977
03:02:52,150 --> 03:02:52,160
it and generate a yield on it that's in
 

9978
03:02:52,160 --> 03:02:54,309
it and generate a yield on it that's in
excess of the maintenance cost so if you

9979
03:02:54,309 --> 03:02:54,319
excess of the maintenance cost so if you
 

9980
03:02:54,319 --> 03:02:56,550
excess of the maintenance cost so if you
consider digital property

9981
03:02:56,550 --> 03:02:56,560
consider digital property
 

9982
03:02:56,560 --> 03:02:59,510
consider digital property
that's a hundred to two hundred trillion

9983
03:02:59,510 --> 03:02:59,520
that's a hundred to two hundred trillion
 

9984
03:02:59,520 --> 03:03:00,870
that's a hundred to two hundred trillion
dollar

9985
03:03:00,870 --> 03:03:00,880
dollar
 

9986
03:03:00,880 --> 03:03:03,590
dollar
uh addressable market so i would think

9987
03:03:03,590 --> 03:03:03,600
uh addressable market so i would think
 

9988
03:03:03,600 --> 03:03:05,590
uh addressable market so i would think
it you know it goes from ten trillion to

9989
03:03:05,590 --> 03:03:05,600
it you know it goes from ten trillion to
 

9990
03:03:05,600 --> 03:03:06,870
it you know it goes from ten trillion to
a hundred trillion as people start to

9991
03:03:06,870 --> 03:03:06,880
a hundred trillion as people start to
 

9992
03:03:06,880 --> 03:03:08,389
a hundred trillion as people start to
think of it as digital property what

9993
03:03:08,389 --> 03:03:08,399
think of it as digital property what
 

9994
03:03:08,399 --> 03:03:10,150
think of it as digital property what
does that mean in terms of price

9995
03:03:10,150 --> 03:03:10,160
does that mean in terms of price
 

9996
03:03:10,160 --> 03:03:14,389
does that mean in terms of price
uh per per coin at 500 000

9997
03:03:14,389 --> 03:03:14,399
uh per per coin at 500 000
 

9998
03:03:14,399 --> 03:03:17,110
uh per per coin at 500 000
right that's a 10 trillion dollar asset

9999
03:03:17,110 --> 03:03:17,120
right that's a 10 trillion dollar asset
 

10000
03:03:17,120 --> 03:03:19,750
right that's a 10 trillion dollar asset
at 5 million that's a 100 trillion

10001
03:03:19,750 --> 03:03:19,760
at 5 million that's a 100 trillion
 

10002
03:03:19,760 --> 03:03:21,990
at 5 million that's a 100 trillion
dollar asset so i think it crosses a

10003
03:03:21,990 --> 03:03:22,000
dollar asset so i think it crosses a
 

10004
03:03:22,000 --> 03:03:24,230
dollar asset so i think it crosses a
million it can go even higher

10005
03:03:24,230 --> 03:03:24,240
million it can go even higher
 

10006
03:03:24,240 --> 03:03:26,150
million it can go even higher
yeah i think it keeps going up forever i

10007
03:03:26,150 --> 03:03:26,160
yeah i think it keeps going up forever i
 

10008
03:03:26,160 --> 03:03:27,110
yeah i think it keeps going up forever i
mean there's no reason we couldn't go to

10009
03:03:27,110 --> 03:03:27,120
mean there's no reason we couldn't go to
 

10010
03:03:27,120 --> 03:03:29,830
mean there's no reason we couldn't go to
10 million a coin right because

10011
03:03:29,830 --> 03:03:29,840
10 million a coin right because
 

10012
03:03:29,840 --> 03:03:31,910
10 million a coin right because
digital property isn't the highest form

10013
03:03:31,910 --> 03:03:31,920
digital property isn't the highest form
 

10014
03:03:31,920 --> 03:03:35,349
digital property isn't the highest form
right gold was that low frequency money

10015
03:03:35,349 --> 03:03:35,359
right gold was that low frequency money
 

10016
03:03:35,359 --> 03:03:37,910
right gold was that low frequency money
property is a mid-frequency money but

10017
03:03:37,910 --> 03:03:37,920
property is a mid-frequency money but
 

10018
03:03:37,920 --> 03:03:39,429
property is a mid-frequency money but
when i start to

10019
03:03:39,429 --> 03:03:39,439
when i start to
 

10020
03:03:39,439 --> 03:03:42,469
when i start to
when i start to um program it

10021
03:03:42,469 --> 03:03:42,479
when i start to um program it
 

10022
03:03:42,479 --> 03:03:44,870
when i start to um program it
faster it starts to look like digital

10023
03:03:44,870 --> 03:03:44,880
faster it starts to look like digital
 

10024
03:03:44,880 --> 03:03:46,070
faster it starts to look like digital
energy

10025
03:03:46,070 --> 03:03:46,080
energy
 

10026
03:03:46,080 --> 03:03:48,630
energy
and and

10027
03:03:48,630 --> 03:03:48,640
and and
 

10028
03:03:48,640 --> 03:03:50,469
and and
then it doesn't just replace property

10029
03:03:50,469 --> 03:03:50,479
then it doesn't just replace property
 

10030
03:03:50,479 --> 03:03:53,590
then it doesn't just replace property
then you're starting to replace bonds

10031
03:03:53,590 --> 03:03:53,600
then you're starting to replace bonds
 

10032
03:03:53,600 --> 03:03:56,550
then you're starting to replace bonds
it's 100 trillion in bonds there's

10033
03:03:56,550 --> 03:03:56,560
it's 100 trillion in bonds there's
 

10034
03:03:56,560 --> 03:03:58,309
it's 100 trillion in bonds there's
50 to 100 trillion in other currency

10035
03:03:58,309 --> 03:03:58,319
50 to 100 trillion in other currency

10040
03:04:01,680 --> 03:04:03,990
and then and then and these are all
conventional use cases right i think

10041
03:04:03,990 --> 03:04:04,000
conventional use cases right i think
 

10042
03:04:04,000 --> 03:04:05,190
conventional use cases right i think
that

10043
03:04:05,190 --> 03:04:05,200
that
 

10044
03:04:05,200 --> 03:04:07,990

though when
 

10214
03:07:08,720 --> 03:07:11,670
though when
uh you build a lot a market of layer two

10215
03:07:11,670 --> 03:07:11,680
uh you build a lot a market of layer two
 

10216
03:07:11,680 --> 03:07:13,429
uh you build a lot a market of layer two
and layer three technologies on top of

10217
03:07:13,429 --> 03:07:13,439
and layer three technologies on top of
 

10218
03:07:13,439 --> 03:07:15,590
and layer three technologies on top of
that so like

10219
03:07:15,590 --> 03:07:15,600
that so like
 

10220
03:07:15,600 --> 03:07:16,710

kinds of ideas it's always
 

10228
03:07:22,479 --> 03:07:24,710
kinds of ideas it's always
touching humans at some point

10229
03:07:24,710 --> 03:07:24,720
touching humans at some point
 

10230
03:07:24,720 --> 03:07:25,750
touching humans at some point
and the

10231
03:07:25,750 --> 03:07:25,760
and the
 

10232
03:07:25,760 --> 03:07:27,110
and the
um

10233
03:07:27,110 --> 03:07:27,120
um
 

10234
03:07:27,120 --> 03:07:29,750
um
you know consumers or humans business

10235
03:07:29,750 --> 03:07:29,760
you know consumers or humans business
 

10236
03:07:29,760 --> 03:07:31,590
you know consumers or humans business
owners and so on so you have to create

10237
03:07:31,590 --> 03:07:31,600
owners and so on so you have to create
 

10238
03:07:31,600 --> 03:07:33,510
owners and so on so you have to create
interface you have to create

10239
03:07:33,510 --> 03:07:33,520
interface you have to create
 

10240
03:07:33,520 --> 03:07:35,830
interface you have to create
services that make all that super

10241
03:07:35,830 --> 03:07:35,840
services that make all that super
 

10242
03:07:35,840 --> 03:07:38,790
services that make all that super
efficient super fun to use pleasant

10243
03:07:38,790 --> 03:07:38,800
efficient super fun to use pleasant
 

10244
03:07:38,800 --> 03:07:41,030
efficient super fun to use pleasant
effective all those kinds of things so

10245
03:07:41,030 --> 03:07:41,040
effective all those kinds of things so
 

10246
03:07:41,040 --> 03:07:42,870
effective all those kinds of things so
you have to build a whole economy on top

10247
03:07:42,870 --> 03:07:42,880
you have to build a whole economy on top
 

10248
03:07:42,880 --> 03:07:44,389
you have to build a whole economy on top
of that yeah i happen to think that

10249
03:07:44,389 --> 03:07:44,399
of that yeah i happen to think that
 

10250
03:07:44,399 --> 03:07:45,750
of that yeah i happen to think that
won't be done

10251
03:07:45,750 --> 03:07:45,760
won't be done
 

10252
03:07:45,760 --> 03:07:47,429
won't be done
by the crypto industry at all i think

10253
03:07:47,429 --> 03:07:47,439
by the crypto industry at all i think
 

10254
03:07:47,439 --> 03:07:49,349
by the crypto industry at all i think
that'll be done by centralized

10255
03:07:49,349 --> 03:07:49,359
that'll be done by centralized
 

10256
03:07:49,359 --> 03:07:50,950
that'll be done by centralized
applications

10257
03:07:50,950 --> 03:07:50,960
applications
 

10258
03:07:50,960 --> 03:07:53,190
applications
i think it'll be you know the citadels

10259
03:07:53,190 --> 03:07:53,200
i think it'll be you know the citadels
 

10260
03:07:53,200 --> 03:07:55,349
i think it'll be you know the citadels
of the world the high-speed traders of

10261
03:07:55,349 --> 03:07:55,359
of the world the high-speed traders of
 

10262
03:07:55,359 --> 03:07:57,510
of the world the high-speed traders of
the world the new yorkers

10263
03:07:57,510 --> 03:07:57,520
the world the new yorkers
 

10264
03:07:57,520 --> 03:07:59,429
the world the new yorkers
i think i think it'll be

10265
03:07:59,429 --> 03:07:59,439
i think i think it'll be
 

10266
03:07:59,439 --> 03:08:02,870
i think i think it'll be
binance ftx and coin base as a as a

10267
03:08:02,870 --> 03:08:02,880
binance ftx and coin base as a as a
 

10268
03:08:02,880 --> 03:08:05,349
binance ftx and coin base as a as a
layer 3 exchange that will give you the

10269
03:08:05,349 --> 03:08:05,359
layer 3 exchange that will give you the
 

10270
03:08:05,359 --> 03:08:08,309
layer 3 exchange that will give you the
yield and will give you the loan

10271
03:08:08,309 --> 03:08:08,319
yield and will give you the loan
 

10272
03:08:08,319 --> 03:08:10,389
yield and will give you the loan
and the the best terms

10273
03:08:10,389 --> 03:08:10,399
and the the best terms
 

10274
03:08:10,399 --> 03:08:12,150
and the the best terms
because ultimately you have to jump

10275
03:08:12,150 --> 03:08:12,160
because ultimately you have to jump
 

10276
03:08:12,160 --> 03:08:14,469
because ultimately you have to jump
these compliance hoops it's a it comes

10277
03:08:14,469 --> 03:08:14,479
these compliance hoops it's a it comes
 

10278
03:08:14,479 --> 03:08:17,590
these compliance hoops it's a it comes
like block fi can give you yield but

10279
03:08:17,590 --> 03:08:17,600
like block fi can give you yield but
 

10280
03:08:17,600 --> 03:08:19,670
like block fi can give you yield but
they have to do it in compliant way with

10281
03:08:19,670 --> 03:08:19,680
they have to do it in compliant way with
 

10282
03:08:19,680 --> 03:08:21,910
they have to do it in compliant way with
the united states jurisdiction

10283
03:08:21,910 --> 03:08:21,920
the united states jurisdiction
 

10284
03:08:21,920 --> 03:08:24,950
the united states jurisdiction
so ultimately those applications to use

10285
03:08:24,950 --> 03:08:24,960
so ultimately those applications to use
 

10286
03:08:24,960 --> 03:08:27,830
so ultimately those applications to use
that digital property and either

10287
03:08:27,830 --> 03:08:27,840
that digital property and either
 

10288
03:08:27,840 --> 03:08:28,790
that digital property and either
either

10289
03:08:28,790 --> 03:08:28,800
either
 

10290
03:08:28,800 --> 03:08:30,870
either
generate a loan give you a loan on it or

10291
03:08:30,870 --> 03:08:30,880
generate a loan give you a loan on it or
 

10292
03:08:30,880 --> 03:08:32,469
generate a loan give you a loan on it or
give you yield on it are going to come

10293
03:08:32,469 --> 03:08:32,479
give you yield on it are going to come
 

10294
03:08:32,479 --> 03:08:35,349
give you yield on it are going to come
from companies but the difference

10295
03:08:35,349 --> 03:08:35,359
from companies but the difference
 

10296
03:08:35,359 --> 03:08:38,389
from companies but the difference
the fundamental difference is

10297
03:08:38,389 --> 03:08:38,399
the fundamental difference is
 

10298
03:08:38,399 --> 03:08:40,870
the fundamental difference is
it could be companies anywhere in the

10299
03:08:40,870 --> 03:08:40,880
it could be companies anywhere in the
 

10300
03:08:40,880 --> 03:08:43,830
it could be companies anywhere in the
world so if a company in singapore

10301
03:08:43,830 --> 03:08:43,840
world so if a company in singapore
 

10302
03:08:43,840 --> 03:08:47,030
world so if a company in singapore
comes up with a better offering

10303
03:08:47,030 --> 03:08:47,040
comes up with a better offering
 

10304
03:08:47,040 --> 03:08:48,630
comes up with a better offering
right then the capital is going to start

10305
03:08:48,630 --> 03:08:48,640
right then the capital is going to start
 

10306
03:08:48,640 --> 03:08:51,750
right then the capital is going to start
to flow to singapore i can't send 10

10307
03:08:51,750 --> 03:08:51,760
to flow to singapore i can't send 10
 

10308
03:08:51,760 --> 03:08:55,429
to flow to singapore i can't send 10
city blocks of la to singapore to rent

10312
03:08:58,960 --> 03:09:01,670
during a festival but i can send 10
blocks of bitcoin to singapore

10313
03:09:01,670 --> 03:09:01,680
blocks of bitcoin to singapore
 

10314
03:09:01,680 --> 03:09:03,750
blocks of bitcoin to singapore
so you've got a truly global market

10315
03:09:03,750 --> 03:09:03,760
so you've got a truly global market
 

10316
03:09:03,760 --> 03:09:06,950
so you've got a truly global market
that's functioning and this asset and

10317
03:09:06,950 --> 03:09:06,960
that's functioning and this asset and
 

10318
03:09:06,960 --> 03:09:09,429
that's functioning and this asset and
it's a second order asset for example

10319
03:09:09,429 --> 03:09:09,439
it's a second order asset for example
 

10320
03:09:09,439 --> 03:09:11,269
it's a second order asset for example
maybe you're an american citizen and you

10321
03:09:11,269 --> 03:09:11,279
maybe you're an american citizen and you
 

10322
03:09:11,279 --> 03:09:13,590
maybe you're an american citizen and you
own 10 bitcoin and someone in singapore

10323
03:09:13,590 --> 03:09:13,600
own 10 bitcoin and someone in singapore
 

10324
03:09:13,600 --> 03:09:16,309
own 10 bitcoin and someone in singapore
will generate 27 yield in the bitcoin

10325
03:09:16,309 --> 03:09:16,319
will generate 27 yield in the bitcoin
 

10326
03:09:16,319 --> 03:09:18,790
will generate 27 yield in the bitcoin
but legally you can't send the money to

10327
03:09:18,790 --> 03:09:18,800
but legally you can't send the money to
 

10328
03:09:18,800 --> 03:09:21,030
but legally you can't send the money to
them or the bitcoin to them it doesn't

10329
03:09:21,030 --> 03:09:21,040
them or the bitcoin to them it doesn't
 

10330
03:09:21,040 --> 03:09:23,190
them or the bitcoin to them it doesn't
matter because the fact that that exists

10331
03:09:23,190 --> 03:09:23,200
matter because the fact that that exists
 

10332
03:09:23,200 --> 03:09:25,429
matter because the fact that that exists
means that someone in hong kong will

10333
03:09:25,429 --> 03:09:25,439
means that someone in hong kong will
 

10334
03:09:25,439 --> 03:09:27,510
means that someone in hong kong will
borrow the 10 bitcoin

10335
03:09:27,510 --> 03:09:27,520
borrow the 10 bitcoin
 

10336
03:09:27,520 --> 03:09:29,910
borrow the 10 bitcoin
from somebody in new york and then they

10337
03:09:29,910 --> 03:09:29,920
from somebody in new york and then they
 

10338
03:09:29,920 --> 03:09:32,630
from somebody in new york and then they
will put on the trade in singapore and

10339
03:09:32,630 --> 03:09:32,640
will put on the trade in singapore and
 

10340
03:09:32,640 --> 03:09:34,550
will put on the trade in singapore and
that will create a demand for bitcoin

10341
03:09:34,550 --> 03:09:34,560
that will create a demand for bitcoin
 

10342
03:09:34,560 --> 03:09:36,389
that will create a demand for bitcoin
which will drive up the price of bitcoin

10343
03:09:36,389 --> 03:09:36,399
which will drive up the price of bitcoin
 

10344
03:09:36,399 --> 03:09:38,950
which will drive up the price of bitcoin
which will result in an effective

10345
03:09:38,950 --> 03:09:38,960
which will result in an effective
 

10346
03:09:38,960 --> 03:09:41,510
which will result in an effective
tax-free yield for the person in the u.s

10347
03:09:41,510 --> 03:09:41,520
tax-free yield for the person in the u.s
 

10348
03:09:41,520 --> 03:09:43,670
tax-free yield for the person in the u.s
that's not even in the jurisdiction

10349
03:09:43,670 --> 03:09:43,680
that's not even in the jurisdiction
 

10350
03:09:43,680 --> 03:09:45,910
that's not even in the jurisdiction
so there's nothing that's going on in

03:09:45,910 --> 03:09:45,920
so there's nothing that's going on in
 

10352
03:09:45,920 --> 03:09:48,150
so there's nothing that's going on in
singapore to drive up the price of your

but there is something going on
 

10358
03:09:52,319 --> 03:09:53,990
but there is something going on
everywhere in the world to drive up the

03:09:53,990 --> 03:09:54,000
everywhere in the world to drive up the
 

10360
03:09:54,000 --> 03:09:56,550
everywhere in the world to drive up the

most of them 99 of them could be cured
 

10530
03:12:58,880 --> 03:13:01,030
most of them 99 of them could be cured
if we introduced

because otherwise uh you're you're
subjecting their entire following to

uh but the other
 

10632
03:14:50,560 --> 03:14:52,550
uh but the other
the other what's the orange verification

10633
03:14:52,550 --> 03:14:52,560
the other what's the orange verification
 

10634
03:14:52,560 --> 03:14:54,790
the other what's the orange verification
so the the this idea can you actually

10635
03:14:54,790 --> 03:14:54,800
so the the this idea can you actually
 

10636
03:14:54,800 --> 03:14:56,229
so the the this idea can you actually
elaborate a little bit more if you put

10637
03:14:56,229 --> 03:14:56,239
elaborate a little bit more if you put
 

10638
03:14:56,239 --> 03:14:58,630
elaborate a little bit more if you put
up 20 bucks yeah i think everybody on

10639
03:14:58,630 --> 03:14:58,640
up 20 bucks yeah i think everybody on
 

10640
03:14:58,640 --> 03:14:59,750
up 20 bucks yeah i think everybody on
twitter ought to be able to get an

10641
03:14:59,750 --> 03:14:59,760
twitter ought to be able to get an
 

10642
03:14:59,760 --> 03:15:01,429
twitter ought to be able to get an
orange check if they could come up with

10643
03:15:01,429 --> 03:15:01,439
orange check if they could come up with
 

10644
03:15:01,439 --> 03:15:03,990
orange check if they could come up with
like ten dollars and what is the power

10645
03:15:03,990 --> 03:15:04,000
like ten dollars and what is the power
 

10646
03:15:04,000 --> 03:15:05,269
like ten dollars and what is the power
of that orange

10647
03:15:05,269 --> 03:15:05,279
of that orange
 

10648
03:15:05,279 --> 03:15:08,150
of that orange
check what what does that verify exactly

10649
03:15:08,150 --> 03:15:08,160
check what what does that verify exactly
 

10650
03:15:08,160 --> 03:15:10,870
check what what does that verify exactly
you basically post a security deposit

10651
03:15:10,870 --> 03:15:10,880
you basically post a security deposit
 

10652
03:15:10,880 --> 03:15:13,750

so you put the 10 of the 20 into the

10667
03:15:30,070 --> 03:15:30,080
so you put the 10 of the 20 into the
 

10668
03:15:30,080 --> 03:15:33,190
so you put the 10 of the 20 into the
lightning wallet you get an orange check

10669
03:15:33,190 --> 03:15:33,200
lightning wallet you get an orange check
 

10670
03:15:33,200 --> 03:15:35,190
lightning wallet you get an orange check
then twitter just gives you a setting

10671
03:15:35,190 --> 03:15:35,200
then twitter just gives you a setting
 

10672
03:15:35,200 --> 03:15:36,710

03:15:43,110 --> 03:15:43,120
so instead of locking out the public and
 

10682
03:15:43,120 --> 03:15:45,110
so instead of locking out the public and
just letting your followers

unverified and that means people that
 

10688
03:15:50,239 --> 03:15:52,550
unverified and that means people that
don't want to post 10 security deposit

then uh you're in position to monetize
 

10696

right now you sit and you go report

10711
03:16:17,590 --> 03:16:17,600
right now you sit and you go report

if you spend an hour
you get through half of them you waste

they just spent up another 97 gazillion

10721
03:16:27,590 --> 03:16:27,600
they just spent up another 97 gazillion
 

10722
03:16:27,600 --> 03:16:28,950
they just spent up another 97 gazillion
because they've got a python script

10723
03:16:28,950 --> 03:16:28,960
because they've got a python script
 

10724
03:16:28,960 --> 03:16:31,030
because they've got a python script
spending it up so it's hopeless

10725
03:16:31,030 --> 03:16:31,040
spending it up so it's hopeless
 

10726
03:16:31,040 --> 03:16:33,429
spending it up so it's hopeless
but on the other hand if you report them

10727
03:16:33,429 --> 03:16:33,439
but on the other hand if you report them
 

10728
03:16:33,439 --> 03:16:35,510
but on the other hand if you report them
and they really are a bot it's

10729
03:16:35,510 --> 03:16:35,520
and they really are a bot it's
 

10730

and they really are a bot it's
twitter's got a method to actually

10731
03:16:38,389 --> 03:16:38,399
twitter's got a method to actually
 

10732
03:16:38,399 --> 03:16:39,910
twitter's got a method to actually
delete the account they know that

10733
03:16:39,910 --> 03:16:39,920
delete the account they know that
 

10734
03:16:39,920 --> 03:16:41,110
delete the account they know that
they're bots

10735
03:16:41,110 --> 03:16:41,120
they're bots
 

10736
03:16:41,120 --> 03:16:42,550
they're bots
the problem is not they don't know how

10737
03:16:42,550 --> 03:16:42,560
the problem is not they don't know how
 

10738
03:16:42,560 --> 03:16:43,830
the problem is not they don't know how
to delete the account the problem is

10739
03:16:43,830 --> 03:16:43,840
to delete the account the problem is
 

10740
03:16:43,840 --> 03:16:45,349
to delete the account the problem is
there are no consequences when they

10741
03:16:45,349 --> 03:16:45,359
there are no consequences when they
 

10742
03:16:45,359 --> 03:16:46,790
there are no consequences when they
delete the account

10743
03:16:46,790 --> 03:16:46,800
delete the account
 

10744
03:16:46,800 --> 03:16:47,830
delete the account
so

10745
03:16:47,830 --> 03:16:47,840
so
 

10746
03:16:47,840 --> 03:16:49,670
so
if there are consequences

10747
03:16:49,670 --> 03:16:49,680
if there are consequences
 

10748
03:16:49,680 --> 03:16:51,510
if there are consequences
twitter could give they could just seize

10749
03:16:51,510 --> 03:16:51,520
twitter could give they could just seize
 

10750
03:16:51,520 --> 03:16:53,110
twitter could give they could just seize
the ten dollars or seize the twenty

10751
03:16:53,110 --> 03:16:53,120
the ten dollars or seize the twenty
 

10752
03:16:53,120 --> 03:16:55,190
the ten dollars or seize the twenty
dollars because it's a bot it's it's a

10753
03:16:55,190 --> 03:16:55,200
dollars because it's a bot it's it's a
 

10754
03:16:55,200 --> 03:16:58,469
dollars because it's a bot it's it's a
malicious criminal act or whatever it is

10755
03:16:58,469 --> 03:16:58,479
malicious criminal act or whatever it is
 

10756
03:16:58,479 --> 03:17:01,429
malicious criminal act or whatever it is
a violation of platform rules

10757
03:17:01,429 --> 03:17:01,439
a violation of platform rules
 

10758
03:17:01,439 --> 03:17:03,670
a violation of platform rules
you end up seizing ten thousand dollars

10759
03:17:03,670 --> 03:17:03,680
you end up seizing ten thousand dollars
 

10760
03:17:03,680 --> 03:17:05,349
you end up seizing ten thousand dollars
give half the money to the reporter and

10761
03:17:05,349 --> 03:17:05,359
give half the money to the reporter and
 

10762
03:17:05,359 --> 03:17:07,990
give half the money to the reporter and
half the money to the twitter platform

10763
03:17:07,990 --> 03:17:08,000
half the money to the twitter platform
 

10764
03:17:08,000 --> 03:17:09,750
half the money to the twitter platform
and it's a really powerful idea but that

10765
03:17:09,750 --> 03:17:09,760
and it's a really powerful idea but that
 

10766
03:17:09,760 --> 03:17:12,790
and it's a really powerful idea but that
that's tying it that's adding friction

10767
03:17:12,790 --> 03:17:12,800
that's tying it that's adding friction
 

10768
03:17:12,800 --> 03:17:15,190
that's tying it that's adding friction
akin to the kind of friction you have

10769
03:17:15,190 --> 03:17:15,200
akin to the kind of friction you have
 

10770
03:17:15,200 --> 03:17:16,950
akin to the kind of friction you have
in the physical world you're tying you

10771
03:17:16,950 --> 03:17:16,960
in the physical world you're tying you
 

10772
03:17:16,960 --> 03:17:18,550
in the physical world you're tying you
have consequences you have real

10773
03:17:18,550 --> 03:17:18,560
have consequences you have real
 

10774
03:17:18,560 --> 03:17:20,070
have consequences you have real
consequences

10775
03:17:20,070 --> 03:17:20,080
consequences
 

10776
03:17:20,080 --> 03:17:21,910
consequences
conservation of energy conservation of

10777
03:17:21,910 --> 03:17:21,920
conservation of energy conservation of
 

10778
03:17:21,920 --> 03:17:23,590
conservation of energy conservation of
energy there's no friction there's no

10779
03:17:23,590 --> 03:17:23,600
energy there's no friction there's no
 

10780
03:17:23,600 --> 03:17:25,190
energy there's no friction there's no
nothing on this earth

10781
03:17:25,190 --> 03:17:25,200
nothing on this earth
 

10782
03:17:25,200 --> 03:17:27,349
nothing on this earth
right i mean you can't walk across the

10783
03:17:27,349 --> 03:17:27,359
right i mean you can't walk across the
 

10784
03:17:27,359 --> 03:17:28,870
right i mean you can't walk across the
room without friction

10785
03:17:28,870 --> 03:17:28,880
room without friction
 

10786
03:17:28,880 --> 03:17:32,229
room without friction
right so that friction is not bad

10787
03:17:32,229 --> 03:17:32,239
right so that friction is not bad
 

10788
03:17:32,239 --> 03:17:33,710
right so that friction is not bad
right uh

10789
03:17:33,710 --> 03:17:33,720
right uh
 

10790
03:17:33,720 --> 03:17:36,550
right uh
unnecessary friction

10791
03:17:36,550 --> 03:17:36,560
unnecessary friction
 

10792
03:17:36,560 --> 03:17:37,830
unnecessary friction
is bad

10793
03:17:37,830 --> 03:17:37,840
is bad
 

10794
03:17:37,840 --> 03:17:39,349
is bad
so in this particular case you're

10795
03:17:39,349 --> 03:17:39,359
so in this particular case you're
 

10796
03:17:39,359 --> 03:17:42,309
so in this particular case you're
introducing conservation of energy and

10797
03:17:42,309 --> 03:17:42,319
introducing conservation of energy and
 

10798
03:17:42,319 --> 03:17:43,510
introducing conservation of energy and
in essence you're introducing the

10799
03:17:43,510 --> 03:17:43,520
in essence you're introducing the
 

10800
03:17:43,520 --> 03:17:46,469
in essence you're introducing the
concept of consequence or truth

10801
03:17:46,469 --> 03:17:46,479
concept of consequence or truth
 

10802
03:17:46,479 --> 03:17:48,150
concept of consequence or truth
into cyberspace

10803
03:17:48,150 --> 03:17:48,160
into cyberspace
 

10804
03:17:48,160 --> 03:17:50,229
into cyberspace
and that means if you do want to spin up

10805
03:17:50,229 --> 03:17:50,239
and that means if you do want to spin up
 

10806
03:17:50,239 --> 03:17:54,550
and that means if you do want to spin up
10 million fakes fake less freedmen's

10807

10 million fakes fake less freedmen's

it's going to cost you 100 million
 

10812
03:17:56,560 --> 03:17:59,349
it's going to cost you 100 million
dollars to spend up 10 million fake

10813
03:17:59,349 --> 03:17:59,359
dollars to spend up 10 million fake
 

10814
03:17:59,359 --> 03:18:00,870
dollars to spend up 10 million fake
lexus the thing is you could do that

10815
03:18:00,870 --> 03:18:00,880
lexus the thing is you could do that
 

10816
03:18:00,880 --> 03:18:02,870
lexus the thing is you could do that
with the dollar but your case you're

10817
03:18:02,870 --> 03:18:02,880
with the dollar but your case you're
 

10818
03:18:02,880 --> 03:18:03,990
with the dollar but your case you're
saying that

10819
03:18:03,990 --> 03:18:04,000
saying that
 

10820
03:18:04,000 --> 03:18:05,349
saying that
it's

yeah well let's follow up on that idea a

10829
03:18:11,990 --> 03:18:12,000
yeah well let's follow up on that idea a
 

10830

everybody that wants to remain anonymous
 

10862
03:18:44,640 --> 03:18:46,790
everybody that wants to remain anonymous
but you've also got this other problem

10863
03:18:46,790 --> 03:18:46,800
but you've also got this other problem
 

10864
03:18:46,800 --> 03:18:48,150
but you've also got this other problem
which is

10865
03:18:48,150 --> 03:18:48,160
which is
 

10866
03:18:48,160 --> 03:18:50,309
which is
credit you know credit cards are

10867
03:18:50,309 --> 03:18:50,319
credit you know credit cards are
 

10868

slow settlement
so

10873
03:18:56,389 --> 03:18:56,399
so
 

10874
03:18:56,399 --> 03:18:58,070
so
do you really want to pay two and a half

10875
03:18:58,070 --> 03:18:58,080

10878
03:19:00,960 --> 03:19:03,990
percent every time you actually show a
20 deposit and maybe you could do a

10879
03:19:03,990 --> 03:19:04,000
20 deposit and maybe you could do a
 

10880
03:19:04,000 --> 03:19:07,429
20 deposit and maybe you could do a
kludgy version of this for a subset of

i i think you need uh two things you
 

11014
03:21:30,319 --> 03:21:32,870
i i think you need uh two things you
need an idea like a digital asset like

11018
03:21:35,200 --> 03:21:37,750
bitcoin that's a bearer instrument for
final settlement and then you need a

11019
03:21:37,750 --> 03:21:37,760
final settlement and then you need a
 

11020
03:21:37,760 --> 03:21:39,830
final settlement and then you need a
high-speed transaction network like

11021
03:21:39,830 --> 03:21:39,840
high-speed transaction network like
 

11022
03:21:39,840 --> 03:21:42,710
high-speed transaction network like
lightning where the transaction cost

11023
03:21:42,710 --> 03:21:42,720
lightning where the transaction cost
 

11024
03:21:42,720 --> 03:21:44,790
lightning where the transaction cost
might be a 20th of a penny

11025

or or less
 

11028
03:21:46,640 --> 03:21:51,030
or or less
and if you roll the clock back 24 months

11029
03:21:51,030 --> 03:21:51,040
and if you roll the clock back 24 months
 

11030
03:21:51,040 --> 03:21:52,389
and if you roll the clock back 24 months
i don't think you had

i don't think you had
 

11032

i don't think you had
uh the lightning network in a stable

11033
03:21:54,950 --> 03:21:54,960
uh the lightning network in a stable
 

11034
03:21:54,960 --> 03:21:56,870
uh the lightning network in a stable
point it's really just the past 12

11035
03:21:56,870 --> 03:21:56,880
point it's really just the past 12
 

11036
03:21:56,880 --> 03:21:58,710
point it's really just the past 12
months it's an idea you could think

11037
03:21:58,710 --> 03:21:58,720
months it's an idea you could think
 

11038
03:21:58,720 --> 03:22:01,030
months it's an idea you could think

and i think you need to you need to
 

11042
03:22:04,560 --> 03:22:06,870
and i think you need to you need to
be aware of bitcoin as something other

would say the world wants two things it
 

11150
03:24:04,160 --> 03:24:06,389

wants crypto property as a savings
 

11152
03:24:06,399 --> 03:24:08,870
wants crypto property as a savings
account and it wants cryptocurrency as a

11153

account and it wants cryptocurrency as a
 

11154
03:24:08,880 --> 03:24:11,349
account and it wants cryptocurrency as a
checking account and that means that the

11155
03:24:11,349 --> 03:24:11,359
checking account and that means that the
 

11156
03:24:11,359 --> 03:24:14,150
checking account and that means that the
that the most popular thing really is

11157
03:24:14,150 --> 03:24:14,160
that the most popular thing really is
 

11158
03:24:14,160 --> 03:24:17,030
that the most popular thing really is
going to be a stable coin dollar

11159
03:24:17,030 --> 03:24:17,040
going to be a stable coin dollar
 

11160
03:24:17,040 --> 03:24:19,429
going to be a stable coin dollar
right and it's there's a maybe a fight

11161
03:24:19,429 --> 03:24:19,439
right and it's there's a maybe a fight
 

11162
03:24:19,439 --> 03:24:23,269
right and it's there's a maybe a fight
right now might be tether right but

11163
03:24:23,269 --> 03:24:23,279
right now might be tether right but
 

11164
03:24:23,279 --> 03:24:25,670
right now might be tether right but
a stable dollar because i feel like the

11165
03:24:25,670 --> 03:24:25,680
a stable dollar because i feel like the
 

11166
03:24:25,680 --> 03:24:27,190
a stable dollar because i feel like the
market

11167
03:24:27,190 --> 03:24:27,200
market
 

11168
03:24:27,200 --> 03:24:29,110
market
opportunity it's not clear that there'll

11169
03:24:29,110 --> 03:24:29,120
opportunity it's not clear that there'll
 

11170
03:24:29,120 --> 03:24:31,510
opportunity it's not clear that there'll
be one that will win the class of stable

11173
03:24:33,429 --> 03:24:33,439
dollars is probably a one to ten
 

11174
03:24:33,439 --> 03:24:37,030

i think that in the crypto platform

11177
03:24:38,790 --> 03:24:38,800
i think that in the crypto platform
 

11178
03:24:38,800 --> 03:24:41,190
i think that in the crypto platform
space ethereum will compete with solana

11179
03:24:41,190 --> 03:24:41,200
space ethereum will compete with solana
 

11180
03:24:41,200 --> 03:24:44,389
space ethereum will compete with solana
and binance smart chain and and the like

03:24:46,070 --> 03:24:46,080
are there certain characteristics of any
 

11184
03:24:46,080 --> 03:24:47,750
are there certain characteristics of any

do you

don't you think the competition is based

11189
03:24:51,349 --> 03:24:51,359
don't you think the competition is based
 

11190
03:24:51,359 --> 03:24:52,950
don't you think the competition is based
on a set of features

11191
03:24:52,950 --> 03:24:52,960
on a set of features
 

11192
03:24:52,960 --> 03:24:56,229
on a set of features
also so the set of features that a the

11193
03:24:56,229 --> 03:24:56,239
also so the set of features that a the
 

11194
03:24:56,239 --> 03:24:57,910
also so the set of features that a the
cryptocurrency provides but also the

11195
03:24:57,910 --> 03:24:57,920
cryptocurrency provides but also the
 

11196
03:24:57,920 --> 03:24:59,910
cryptocurrency provides but also the
community that it provides does you

11197
03:24:59,910 --> 03:24:59,920
community that it provides does you
 

11198
03:24:59,920 --> 03:25:01,670
community that it provides does you
think the community matters and sort of

11199
03:25:01,670 --> 03:25:01,680
think the community matters and sort of
 

11200
03:25:01,680 --> 03:25:04,070
think the community matters and sort of
the adoption the dynamic of the adoption

11201
03:25:04,070 --> 03:25:04,080
the adoption the dynamic of the adoption
 

11202
03:25:04,080 --> 03:25:05,590
the adoption the dynamic of the adoption
both across the developers and the

11203
03:25:05,590 --> 03:25:05,600
both across the developers and the
 

11204
03:25:05,600 --> 03:25:07,349
both across the developers and the
internet i'm looking at them i mean the

11205
03:25:07,349 --> 03:25:07,359
internet i'm looking at them i mean the
 

11206
03:25:07,359 --> 03:25:09,590
internet i'm looking at them i mean the
first question is

11207
03:25:09,590 --> 03:25:09,600
first question is
 

11208
03:25:09,600 --> 03:25:12,229
first question is
is uh what's the regulatory risk how

11209
03:25:12,229 --> 03:25:12,239
is uh what's the regulatory risk how
 

11210
03:25:12,239 --> 03:25:13,830
is uh what's the regulatory risk how
likely is it to be deemed to property

11211
03:25:13,830 --> 03:25:13,840
likely is it to be deemed to property
 

11212
03:25:13,840 --> 03:25:17,269
likely is it to be deemed to property
versus security and the second is

11213
03:25:17,269 --> 03:25:17,279
versus security and the second is
 

11214
03:25:17,279 --> 03:25:19,190
versus security and the second is
is what's the competitive risk and the

11215
03:25:19,190 --> 03:25:19,200
is what's the competitive risk and the
 

11216
03:25:19,200 --> 03:25:20,469
is what's the competitive risk and the
third is what's the speed and the

11217
03:25:20,469 --> 03:25:20,479
third is what's the speed and the
 

11218
03:25:20,479 --> 03:25:23,349
third is what's the speed and the
performance and uh and the you know all

11219
03:25:23,349 --> 03:25:23,359
performance and uh and the you know all
 

11220
03:25:23,359 --> 03:25:24,950
performance and uh and the you know all
those things

11221
03:25:24,950 --> 03:25:24,960
those things
 

11222
03:25:24,960 --> 03:25:26,469
those things
you know lead to the question of what's

11223
03:25:26,469 --> 03:25:26,479
you know lead to the question of what's
 

11224
03:25:26,479 --> 03:25:29,030
you know lead to the question of what's
the security risk how likely is it to

11225
03:25:29,030 --> 03:25:29,040
the security risk how likely is it to
 

11226
03:25:29,040 --> 03:25:31,990
the security risk how likely is it to
crash and burn and and how stable or

11227
03:25:31,990 --> 03:25:32,000
crash and burn and and how stable or
 

11228
03:25:32,000 --> 03:25:33,910
crash and burn and and how stable or
unstable is it

11229
03:25:33,910 --> 03:25:33,920
unstable is it
 

11230
03:25:33,920 --> 03:25:35,670
unstable is it
and then there's the mar you know the

11231
03:25:35,670 --> 03:25:35,680
and then there's the mar you know the
 

11232
03:25:35,680 --> 03:25:37,110
and then there's the mar you know the
marketing risk i mean there are

11233
03:25:37,110 --> 03:25:37,120
marketing risk i mean there are
 

11234
03:25:37,120 --> 03:25:38,870
marketing risk i mean there are
different teams behind each of these

11235
03:25:38,870 --> 03:25:38,880
different teams behind each of these
 

11236
03:25:38,880 --> 03:25:41,590
different teams behind each of these
things and and communities behind them

11237
03:25:41,590 --> 03:25:41,600
things and and communities behind them
 

11238
03:25:41,600 --> 03:25:43,910
things and and communities behind them
i i think that um

11239
03:25:43,910 --> 03:25:43,920
i i think that um
 

11240
03:25:43,920 --> 03:25:46,710
i i think that um
the the big cloud looming over the

11241
03:25:46,710 --> 03:25:46,720
the the big cloud looming over the
 

11242
03:25:46,720 --> 03:25:48,469
the the big cloud looming over the
crypto industry

11243
03:25:48,469 --> 03:25:48,479
crypto industry
 

11244
03:25:48,479 --> 03:25:50,070
crypto industry
is regulatory treatment of

11245
03:25:50,070 --> 03:25:50,080
is regulatory treatment of
 

11246
03:25:50,080 --> 03:25:51,750
is regulatory treatment of
cryptocurrencies and regulatory

11247
03:25:51,750 --> 03:25:51,760
cryptocurrencies and regulatory
 

11248
03:25:51,760 --> 03:25:53,510
cryptocurrencies and regulatory
treatment of crypto securities and

11249
03:25:53,510 --> 03:25:53,520
treatment of crypto securities and
 

11250
03:25:53,520 --> 03:25:55,429
treatment of crypto securities and
crypto platforms and i think that won't

11251
03:25:55,429 --> 03:25:55,439
crypto platforms and i think that won't
 

11252
03:25:55,439 --> 03:25:57,110
crypto platforms and i think that won't
be determined until the end of the first

11253
03:25:57,110 --> 03:25:57,120
be determined until the end of the first
 

11254
03:25:57,120 --> 03:25:59,910
be determined until the end of the first

11256
03:25:59,920 --> 03:26:01,910

insured banks to issue cryptocurrencies
 

11262
03:26:06,720 --> 03:26:09,030
insured banks to issue cryptocurrencies
they want jp morgan to issue a crypto

11263
03:26:09,030 --> 03:26:09,040
they want jp morgan to issue a crypto
 

11264

dollar backed one-to-one
 

11266
03:26:11,439 --> 03:26:13,190
dollar backed one-to-one
but then in the us right now we have

11267
03:26:13,190 --> 03:26:13,200
but then in the us right now we have
 

11268
03:26:13,200 --> 03:26:14,870
but then in the us right now we have
circle and we have other companies that

11269
03:26:14,870 --> 03:26:14,880

there's also a debate in congress about

11279
03:26:24,150 --> 03:26:24,160
there's also a debate in congress about
 

11280
03:26:24,160 --> 03:26:25,990
there's also a debate in congress about
whether state chartered banks should be

11281
03:26:25,990 --> 03:26:26,000
whether state chartered banks should be
 

11282
03:26:26,000 --> 03:26:27,990
whether state chartered banks should be
able to issue these things and then we

11283
03:26:27,990 --> 03:26:28,000
able to issue these things and then we
 

11284
03:26:28,000 --> 03:26:29,269
able to issue these things and then we
have

11285
03:26:29,269 --> 03:26:29,279
have
 

11286
03:26:29,279 --> 03:26:32,229
have

they're probably not backed by cash and

11291
03:26:35,990 --> 03:26:36,000
they're probably not backed by cash and
 

11292
03:26:36,000 --> 03:26:38,070
they're probably not backed by cash and
cash equivalents they're backed by stuff

11293
03:26:38,070 --> 03:26:38,080
cash equivalents they're backed by stuff
 

11294
03:26:38,080 --> 03:26:40,150
cash equivalents they're backed by stuff
and we don't know what stuff

11295
03:26:40,150 --> 03:26:40,160
and we don't know what stuff
 

11296
03:26:40,160 --> 03:26:42,070
and we don't know what stuff
and then finally you have

and then finally you have
 

11298
03:26:42,080 --> 03:26:44,630

03:26:44,630 --> 03:26:44,640
you know ust and dye which are

03:26:46,950 --> 03:26:46,960
algorithmic stable coins
 

11302
03:26:46,960 --> 03:26:50,389
algorithmic stable coins
right that are even uh more innovative

11303
03:26:50,389 --> 03:26:50,399
right that are even uh more innovative
 

11304
03:26:50,399 --> 03:26:52,389
right that are even uh more innovative
further outside the compliance framework

11305
03:26:52,389 --> 03:26:52,399
further outside the compliance framework
 

11306
03:26:52,399 --> 03:26:54,229
further outside the compliance framework
so if you ask who's going to win

11307
03:26:54,229 --> 03:26:54,239
so if you ask who's going to win
 

11308
03:26:54,239 --> 03:26:56,550
so if you ask who's going to win
the question is really

11309
03:26:56,550 --> 03:26:56,560
the question is really
 

11310
03:26:56,560 --> 03:26:58,550
the question is really
i don't know will the market decide or

11311
03:26:58,550 --> 03:26:58,560
i don't know will the market decide or
 

11312
03:26:58,560 --> 03:27:00,710
i don't know will the market decide or
will the regulators decide

11313
03:27:00,710 --> 03:27:00,720
will the regulators decide
 

11314
03:27:00,720 --> 03:27:02,229
will the regulators decide
if the regulators get out of the way and

11315
03:27:02,229 --> 03:27:02,239
if the regulators get out of the way and
 

11316
03:27:02,239 --> 03:27:03,910
if the regulators get out of the way and
the market fought out well then it's an

11317
03:27:03,910 --> 03:27:03,920
the market fought out well then it's an
 

11318
03:27:03,920 --> 03:27:06,309
the market fought out well then it's an
interesting discussion yeah and then i

11319
03:27:06,309 --> 03:27:06,319
interesting discussion yeah and then i
 

11320
03:27:06,319 --> 03:27:09,030
interesting discussion yeah and then i
think that all bets are off if if the

11321
03:27:09,030 --> 03:27:09,040
think that all bets are off if if the
 

11322
03:27:09,040 --> 03:27:10,870
think that all bets are off if if the
regulators get more heavy-handed with

11323
03:27:10,870 --> 03:27:10,880
regulators get more heavy-handed with
 

11324
03:27:10,880 --> 03:27:12,550
regulators get more heavy-handed with
this and i think you could have the same

11325
03:27:12,550 --> 03:27:12,560
this and i think you could have the same
 

11326
03:27:12,560 --> 03:27:14,710
this and i think you could have the same
discussion with crypto properties like

11327
03:27:14,710 --> 03:27:14,720
discussion with crypto properties like
 

11328
03:27:14,720 --> 03:27:17,190
discussion with crypto properties like
like the d5 exchanges and the crypto

11329
03:27:17,190 --> 03:27:17,200
like the d5 exchanges and the crypto
 

11330
03:27:17,200 --> 03:27:19,670
like the d5 exchanges and the crypto
exchanges the sec would like to regulate

11331
03:27:19,670 --> 03:27:19,680
exchanges the sec would like to regulate
 

11332
03:27:19,680 --> 03:27:21,110
exchanges the sec would like to regulate
the crypto exchanges they'd like to

11333
03:27:21,110 --> 03:27:21,120
the crypto exchanges they'd like to
 

11334
03:27:21,120 --> 03:27:23,349
the crypto exchanges they'd like to
regulate the d5 exchanges that means

11335
03:27:23,349 --> 03:27:23,359
regulate the d5 exchanges that means
 

11336
03:27:23,359 --> 03:27:25,349
regulate the d5 exchanges that means
they may regulate the crypto platforms

11337
03:27:25,349 --> 03:27:25,359
they may regulate the crypto platforms
 

11338
03:27:25,359 --> 03:27:29,030
they may regulate the crypto platforms
and and at what rate and in what fashion

11339
03:27:29,030 --> 03:27:29,040
and and at what rate and in what fashion
 

11340
03:27:29,040 --> 03:27:30,870
and and at what rate and in what fashion
and so i think that

11341
03:27:30,870 --> 03:27:30,880
and so i think that
 

11342
03:27:30,880 --> 03:27:33,269
and so i think that
i could give you an opinion if if it was

11343
03:27:33,269 --> 03:27:33,279
i could give you an opinion if if it was
 

11344
03:27:33,279 --> 03:27:35,510
i could give you an opinion if if it was
limited to competition and the current

11345
03:27:35,510 --> 03:27:35,520
limited to competition and the current
 

11346
03:27:35,520 --> 03:27:37,830
limited to competition and the current
regulatory regime

11347
03:27:37,830 --> 03:27:37,840
regulatory regime
 

11348
03:27:37,840 --> 03:27:38,790
regulatory regime
but

11349
03:27:38,790 --> 03:27:38,800
but
 

11350
03:27:38,800 --> 03:27:41,990
but
i think that the regulations are are so

11351
03:27:41,990 --> 03:27:42,000
i think that the regulations are are so
 

11352
03:27:42,000 --> 03:27:45,429
i think that the regulations are are so
fast moving and it's so uncertain

11353
03:27:45,429 --> 03:27:45,439
fast moving and it's so uncertain
 

11354
03:27:45,439 --> 03:27:47,190
fast moving and it's so uncertain
that it's

11355
03:27:47,190 --> 03:27:47,200
that it's
 

11356
03:27:47,200 --> 03:27:48,550
that it's
it it

11357
03:27:48,550 --> 03:27:48,560
it it
 

11358
03:27:48,560 --> 03:27:51,110
it it
you can't make a decision

11359
03:27:51,110 --> 03:27:51,120
you can't make a decision
 

11360
03:27:51,120 --> 03:27:53,030
you can't make a decision
without considering

11361
03:27:53,030 --> 03:27:53,040
without considering
 

11362
03:27:53,040 --> 03:27:54,710
without considering
uh the potential actions of the

11363
03:27:54,710 --> 03:27:54,720
uh the potential actions of the
 

11364
03:27:54,720 --> 03:27:57,030
uh the potential actions of the
regulators i hope the regulators get out

11365
03:27:57,030 --> 03:27:57,040
regulators i hope the regulators get out
 

11366
03:27:57,040 --> 03:27:57,990
regulators i hope the regulators get out
of the way

11367
03:27:57,990 --> 03:27:58,000
of the way
 

11368
03:27:58,000 --> 03:28:00,070
of the way
can you steal me on the case that

11369
03:28:00,070 --> 03:28:00,080
can you steal me on the case that
 

11370
03:28:00,080 --> 03:28:02,710
can you steal me on the case that
dogecoin is uh i guess the second best

11371
03:28:02,710 --> 03:28:02,720
dogecoin is uh i guess the second best
 

11372
03:28:02,720 --> 03:28:04,389
dogecoin is uh i guess the second best
cryptocurrency or if you don't consider

11373
03:28:04,389 --> 03:28:04,399
cryptocurrency or if you don't consider
 

11374
03:28:04,399 --> 03:28:06,950
cryptocurrency or if you don't consider
bitcoin a cryptocurrency but instead of

11375
03:28:06,950 --> 03:28:06,960
bitcoin a cryptocurrency but instead of
 

11376
03:28:06,960 --> 03:28:09,830
bitcoin a cryptocurrency but instead of
crypto property i would classify it as

11377
03:28:09,830 --> 03:28:09,840
crypto property i would classify it as
 

11378
03:28:09,840 --> 03:28:12,469
crypto property i would classify it as
crypto property because the us dollar is

11379
03:28:12,469 --> 03:28:12,479
crypto property because the us dollar is
 

11380
03:28:12,479 --> 03:28:15,429
crypto property because the us dollar is
a currency so unless your crypto asset

11381
03:28:15,429 --> 03:28:15,439
a currency so unless your crypto asset
 

11382
03:28:15,439 --> 03:28:18,229
a currency so unless your crypto asset
is pegged algorithmically or stably to

11383
03:28:18,229 --> 03:28:18,239
is pegged algorithmically or stably to
 

11384
03:28:18,239 --> 03:28:20,070
is pegged algorithmically or stably to
the value the dollar is not a currency

11385
03:28:20,070 --> 03:28:20,080
the value the dollar is not a currency
 

11386
03:28:20,080 --> 03:28:22,790
the value the dollar is not a currency
it's a property or it's an asset

11387
03:28:22,790 --> 03:28:22,800
it's a property or it's an asset
 

11388
03:28:22,800 --> 03:28:25,349
it's a property or it's an asset
so then can you still man the case that

11389
03:28:25,349 --> 03:28:25,359
so then can you still man the case that
 

11390
03:28:25,359 --> 03:28:29,429
so then can you still man the case that
doshcoin is the best cryptocurrency then

11391
03:28:29,429 --> 03:28:29,439
doshcoin is the best cryptocurrency then
 

11392
03:28:29,439 --> 03:28:32,630
doshcoin is the best cryptocurrency then
because bitcoin is not even in that list

11393
03:28:32,630 --> 03:28:32,640
because bitcoin is not even in that list
 

11394
03:28:32,640 --> 03:28:34,550
because bitcoin is not even in that list
the debate is going to be whether it's

11395
03:28:34,550 --> 03:28:34,560
the debate is going to be whether it's
 

11396
03:28:34,560 --> 03:28:36,389
the debate is going to be whether it's
property or security and there's a

11397
03:28:36,389 --> 03:28:36,399
property or security and there's a
 

11398
03:28:36,399 --> 03:28:39,030
property or security and there's a
debate whether it's decentralized enough

11399
03:28:39,030 --> 03:28:39,040
debate whether it's decentralized enough
 

11400
03:28:39,040 --> 03:28:42,389
debate whether it's decentralized enough
so let's assume it was decentralized yep

11401
03:28:42,389 --> 03:28:42,399
so let's assume it was decentralized yep
 

11402
03:28:42,399 --> 03:28:44,870
so let's assume it was decentralized yep
well it's it's increasing at not quite

11403
03:28:44,870 --> 03:28:44,880
well it's it's increasing at not quite
 

11404
03:28:44,880 --> 03:28:47,030
well it's it's increasing at not quite
five what five percent a year inflation

11405
03:28:47,030 --> 03:28:47,040
five what five percent a year inflation
 

11406
03:28:47,040 --> 03:28:49,030
five what five percent a year inflation
rate but it's it's not five percent

11407
03:28:49,030 --> 03:28:49,040
rate but it's it's not five percent
 

11408
03:28:49,040 --> 03:28:51,110
rate but it's it's not five percent
exponentially it's like a plus five

11409
03:28:51,110 --> 03:28:51,120
exponentially it's like a plus five
 

11410
03:28:51,120 --> 03:28:53,110
exponentially it's like a plus five
million

11411
03:28:53,110 --> 03:28:53,120
million
 

11412
03:28:53,120 --> 03:28:55,990
million
5 something captain is less

11413
03:28:55,990 --> 03:28:56,000
5 something captain is less
 

11414
03:28:56,000 --> 03:28:58,229
5 something captain is less
i forget the exact number but it's an

11415
03:28:58,229 --> 03:28:58,239
i forget the exact number but it's an
 

11416
03:28:58,239 --> 03:29:00,870
i forget the exact number but it's an
inflationary property it's got a lower

11417
03:29:00,870 --> 03:29:00,880
inflationary property it's got a lower
 

11418
03:29:00,880 --> 03:29:02,790
inflationary property it's got a lower
inflation rate

11419
03:29:02,790 --> 03:29:02,800
inflation rate
 

11420
03:29:02,800 --> 03:29:04,550
inflation rate
than the us dollar

11421
03:29:04,550 --> 03:29:04,560
than the us dollar
 

11422
03:29:04,560 --> 03:29:06,710
than the us dollar
and it's got a much lower inflation rate

11423
03:29:06,710 --> 03:29:06,720
and it's got a much lower inflation rate
 

11424
03:29:06,720 --> 03:29:09,910
and it's got a much lower inflation rate
than than uh many other fiat currencies

11425
03:29:09,910 --> 03:29:09,920
than than uh many other fiat currencies
 

11426
03:29:09,920 --> 03:29:11,990
than than uh many other fiat currencies
so i think you could say that but don't

11427
03:29:11,990 --> 03:29:12,000
so i think you could say that but don't
 

11428
03:29:12,000 --> 03:29:15,590
so i think you could say that but don't
you see the power of meme the power of

it's an early stage

11637
03:33:00,070 --> 03:33:00,080
it's an early stage
 

11638
03:33:00,080 --> 03:33:01,990
it's an early stage
where many people don't understand it

11639
03:33:01,990 --> 03:33:02,000
where many people don't understand it
 

11640
03:33:02,000 --> 03:33:04,790
where many people don't understand it
and they're afraid of it and there's fud

11641
03:33:04,790 --> 03:33:04,800
and they're afraid of it and there's fud
 

11642
03:33:04,800 --> 03:33:06,790
and they're afraid of it and there's fud
and there's uncertainty there's doubt

11643
03:33:06,790 --> 03:33:06,800
and there's uncertainty there's doubt
 

11644
03:33:06,800 --> 03:33:08,070
and there's uncertainty there's doubt
and there's fear

11645
03:33:08,070 --> 03:33:08,080
and there's fear
 

11646
03:33:08,080 --> 03:33:10,389
and there's fear
and there's a very noisy crypto world

11647
03:33:10,389 --> 03:33:10,399
and there's a very noisy crypto world
 

11648
03:33:10,399 --> 03:33:13,510
and there's a very noisy crypto world
and there's 15 000 other cryptos that

11649
03:33:13,510 --> 03:33:13,520
and there's 15 000 other cryptos that
 

11650
03:33:13,520 --> 03:33:16,469
and there's 15 000 other cryptos that
are are seeking relevance

are are seeking relevance
 

11652
03:33:16,479 --> 03:33:18,950
are are seeking relevance
and i think most of the fud

11653
03:33:18,950 --> 03:33:18,960
and i think most of the fud
 

11654
03:33:18,960 --> 03:33:21,030
and i think most of the fud
uh is actually fueled by the other

necessarily perceive that or realize
 

11750
03:35:09,760 --> 03:35:11,990
necessarily perceive that or realize
that but if you were to take any metric

11751
03:35:11,990 --> 03:35:12,000
that but if you were to take any metric

then
you're just laser eyes it's like those

12061
03:40:44,790 --> 03:40:44,800
you're just laser eyes it's like those
 

12062
03:40:44,800 --> 03:40:48,710
you're just laser eyes it's like those
laser eyes you have to focus

12063
03:40:48,710 --> 03:40:48,720

 

12064
03:40:48,720 --> 03:40:51,269

on just a few of those things

12065
03:40:51,269 --> 03:40:51,279
on just a few of those things

yeah i mean
i got a thousand opinions we could talk

12069
03:40:54,469 --> 03:40:54,479
i got a thousand opinions we could talk
 

12070
03:40:54,479 --> 03:40:56,070
i got a thousand opinions we could talk
about and i could pursue a thousand

12071
03:40:56,070 --> 03:40:56,080
about and i could pursue a thousand
 

12072
03:40:56,080 --> 03:40:57,510
about and i could pursue a thousand
things but i don't expect to be

12073
03:40:57,510 --> 03:40:57,520
things but i don't expect to be
 

12074
03:40:57,520 --> 03:41:00,870
things but i don't expect to be

valid

12079
03:41:05,670 --> 03:41:05,680
valid
 

12080
03:41:05,680 --> 03:41:08,630
valid
than the leader of thought in that area

12081
03:41:08,630 --> 03:41:08,640
than the leader of thought in that area
 

12082
03:41:08,640 --> 03:41:10,070
than the leader of thought in that area
so

12083
03:41:10,070 --> 03:41:10,080
so
 

12084
03:41:10,080 --> 03:41:13,510
so
how about if i just focus upon one thing

how about if i just focus upon one thing
 

12086
03:41:13,520 --> 03:41:16,389
how about if i just focus upon one thing
and then uh and then uh deliver the best

12087
03:41:16,389 --> 03:41:16,399
and then uh and then uh deliver the best

million

12203
03:43:23,750 --> 03:43:23,760
million
 

12204
03:43:23,760 --> 03:43:26,309

03:43:44,160 --> 03:43:45,110
contribution to the body of human
knowledge

12223
03:43:45,110 --> 03:43:45,120
knowledge
 

12224
03:43:45,120 --> 03:43:47,110
knowledge
right and and if you haven't done that

12225

12238
03:43:58,960 --> 03:44:01,189
that a phd would be granted for
then i can see that being a reasonable

12239
03:44:01,189 --> 03:44:01,199
then i can see that being a reasonable
 

12240
03:44:01,199 --> 03:44:03,510
then i can see that being a reasonable
pursuit but there are many people that

12241
03:44:03,510 --> 03:44:03,520
pursuit but there are many people that
 

12242
03:44:03,520 --> 03:44:05,269
pursuit but there are many people that
are specialists

12243
03:44:05,269 --> 03:44:05,279
are specialists
 

12244
03:44:05,279 --> 03:44:06,070
are specialists

that you figure out

12291
03:44:50,070 --> 03:44:50,080
that you figure out
 

12292
03:44:50,080 --> 03:44:52,229
that you figure out
what you're passionate about

12293
03:44:52,229 --> 03:44:52,239
what you're passionate about
 

12294
03:44:52,239 --> 03:44:54,469
what you're passionate about
and what you're good at

12295
03:44:54,469 --> 03:44:54,479
and what you're good at
 

12296
03:44:54,479 --> 03:44:57,269
and what you're good at
and you do focus on it

12297
03:44:57,269 --> 03:44:57,279
and you do focus on it
 

12298
03:44:57,279 --> 03:44:59,110
and you do focus on it
especially if

12299
03:44:59,110 --> 03:44:59,120
especially if
 

12300
03:44:59,120 --> 03:45:00,710
especially if
if the thing that you're doing can be

12301
03:45:00,710 --> 03:45:00,720
if the thing that you're doing can be
 

12302
03:45:00,720 --> 03:45:02,710
if the thing that you're doing can be
automated

12303
03:45:02,710 --> 03:45:02,720
automated
 

12304
03:45:02,720 --> 03:45:04,630
automated
the the problem is

12305
03:45:04,630 --> 03:45:04,640
the the problem is
 

12306
03:45:04,640 --> 03:45:07,429
the the problem is
you know back to that 500 000 algebra

12307
03:45:07,429 --> 03:45:07,439
you know back to that 500 000 algebra
 

12308
03:45:07,439 --> 03:45:09,910
you know back to that 500 000 algebra
teacher type comment the problem is if

12309
03:45:09,910 --> 03:45:09,920
teacher type comment the problem is if
 

12310
03:45:09,920 --> 03:45:13,189
teacher type comment the problem is if
it is possible to be automated then over

12311
03:45:13,189 --> 03:45:13,199
it is possible to be automated then over
 

12312
03:45:13,199 --> 03:45:15,030
it is possible to be automated then over
time someone's probably going to

12313
03:45:15,030 --> 03:45:15,040
time someone's probably going to
 

12314
03:45:15,040 --> 03:45:16,790
time someone's probably going to
automate it and

12315
03:45:16,790 --> 03:45:16,800
automate it and
 

12316
03:45:16,800 --> 03:45:17,910
automate it and
and

12317
03:45:17,910 --> 03:45:17,920
and
 

12318
03:45:17,920 --> 03:45:21,110
and
that that squeezes you know the state

12319
03:45:21,110 --> 03:45:21,120
that that squeezes you know the state
 

12320
03:45:21,120 --> 03:45:23,670
that that squeezes you know the state
space of everybody else it's like like

12321
03:45:23,670 --> 03:45:23,680
space of everybody else it's like like
 

12322
03:45:23,680 --> 03:45:26,150
space of everybody else it's like like
after the lockdowns it used to be there

12323
03:45:26,150 --> 03:45:26,160
after the lockdowns it used to be there
 

12324
03:45:26,160 --> 03:45:28,469
after the lockdowns it used to be there
like all these local bands that played

12325
03:45:28,469 --> 03:45:28,479
like all these local bands that played
 

12326
03:45:28,479 --> 03:45:30,790
like all these local bands that played
in bars and everybody went to the bar to

12327
03:45:30,790 --> 03:45:30,800
in bars and everybody went to the bar to
 

12328
03:45:30,800 --> 03:45:33,030
in bars and everybody went to the bar to
see the local band and then during the

12329
03:45:33,030 --> 03:45:33,040
see the local band and then during the
 

12330
03:45:33,040 --> 03:45:35,510
see the local band and then during the
lockdown you would have like these six

12331
03:45:35,510 --> 03:45:35,520
lockdown you would have like these six
 

12332
03:45:35,520 --> 03:45:38,550
lockdown you would have like these six
super groups and they would all get 500

12333
03:45:38,550 --> 03:45:38,560
super groups and they would all get 500
 

12334
03:45:38,560 --> 03:45:41,110
super groups and they would all get 500
000 or a million followers and all these

12335
03:45:41,110 --> 03:45:41,120
000 or a million followers and all these
 

12336
03:45:41,120 --> 03:45:44,229
000 or a million followers and all these
smaller local bands just got

12337
03:45:44,229 --> 03:45:44,239
smaller local bands just got
 

12338
03:45:44,239 --> 03:45:46,710
smaller local bands just got
no attention

12339
03:45:46,710 --> 03:45:46,720
no attention
 

12340
03:45:46,720 --> 03:45:49,510
no attention
at all well the interesting thing is one

12341
03:45:49,510 --> 03:45:49,520
at all well the interesting thing is one
 

12342
03:45:49,520 --> 03:45:52,150
at all well the interesting thing is one
of those 500 000 algebra teachers is

12343
03:45:52,150 --> 03:45:52,160
of those 500 000 algebra teachers is
 

12344
03:45:52,160 --> 03:45:54,389
of those 500 000 algebra teachers is
likely to be part of the automation so

12345
03:45:54,389 --> 03:45:54,399
likely to be part of the automation so
 

12346
03:45:54,399 --> 03:45:56,150
likely to be part of the automation so
it's like it's an opportunity for you to

12347
03:45:56,150 --> 03:45:56,160
it's like it's an opportunity for you to

having to be friends with librarians and
 

12360
03:46:07,279 --> 03:46:09,830
having to be friends with librarians and
that's libraries will probably be

12361
03:46:09,830 --> 03:46:09,840
that's libraries will probably be
 

12362
03:46:09,840 --> 03:46:11,429
that's libraries will probably be
evolving and it's up to you as a

03:46:11,429 --> 03:46:11,439
evolving and it's up to you as a
 

12364

12399
03:46:50,710 --> 03:46:50,720
then i start binge watching lex yeah but
 

12400
03:46:50,720 --> 03:46:52,950
then i start binge watching lex yeah but
but if you changed your format

12401
03:46:52,950 --> 03:46:52,960
but if you changed your format
 

12402

yeah through 16 different formats so

12403
03:46:55,349 --> 03:46:55,359
yeah through 16 different formats so
 

12404
03:46:55,359 --> 03:46:57,269
yeah through 16 different formats so
that you could compete with 16 different

12405
03:46:57,269 --> 03:46:57,279
that you could compete with 16 different
 

12406
03:46:57,279 --> 03:46:59,590
that you could compete with 16 different
other personalities on youtube

12407
03:46:59,590 --> 03:46:59,600
other personalities on youtube
 

12408
03:46:59,600 --> 03:47:02,309
other personalities on youtube
you'd probably wouldn't beat any of them

12409
03:47:02,309 --> 03:47:02,319
you'd probably wouldn't beat any of them
 

12410
03:47:02,319 --> 03:47:03,830
you'd probably wouldn't beat any of them
right you would probably just kind of

12411
03:47:03,830 --> 03:47:03,840
right you would probably just kind of
 

12412
03:47:03,840 --> 03:47:05,670
right you would probably just kind of
sink into the you're you're the number

12413
03:47:05,670 --> 03:47:05,680
sink into the you're you're the number
 

12414
03:47:05,680 --> 03:47:07,429
sink into the you're you're the number
two or number three guy you're not the

12415
03:47:07,429 --> 03:47:07,439
two or number three guy you're not the
 

12416
03:47:07,439 --> 03:47:10,870
two or number three guy you're not the
number one guy in the format and i think

12417
03:47:10,870 --> 03:47:10,880
number one guy in the format and i think
 

12418
03:47:10,880 --> 03:47:11,670
number one guy in the format and i think
the

12419
03:47:11,670 --> 03:47:11,680
the
 

12420
03:47:11,680 --> 03:47:13,990
the
the the the algorithm

12421
03:47:13,990 --> 03:47:14,000
the the the algorithm
 

12422
03:47:14,000 --> 03:47:15,990
the the the algorithm
right the the twitter algorithm and the

12423
03:47:15,990 --> 03:47:16,000
right the the twitter algorithm and the
 

12424
03:47:16,000 --> 03:47:17,990
right the the twitter algorithm and the
youtube algorithms they really reward

12425
03:47:17,990 --> 03:47:18,000
youtube algorithms they really reward
 

12426
03:47:18,000 --> 03:47:20,950
youtube algorithms they really reward
the person that's focused on message

12427
03:47:20,950 --> 03:47:20,960
the person that's focused on message
 

12428
03:47:20,960 --> 03:47:22,309
the person that's focused on message
consistent

12429
03:47:22,309 --> 03:47:22,319
consistent
 

12430
03:47:22,319 --> 03:47:24,389
consistent
the world wants somebody they can trust

12431
03:47:24,389 --> 03:47:24,399
the world wants somebody they can trust
 

12432
03:47:24,399 --> 03:47:26,950
the world wants somebody they can trust
that's consistent and reliable

12433
03:47:26,950 --> 03:47:26,960
that's consistent and reliable
 

12434
03:47:26,960 --> 03:47:28,550
that's consistent and reliable
and they they kind of want to know what

12435
03:47:28,550 --> 03:47:28,560
and they they kind of want to know what
 

12436
03:47:28,560 --> 03:47:31,429
and they they kind of want to know what
they're getting into because

12437
03:47:31,429 --> 03:47:31,439
they're getting into because
 

12438
03:47:31,439 --> 03:47:33,990
they're getting into because
this is taken for granted maybe but

12439
03:47:33,990 --> 03:47:34,000
this is taken for granted maybe but
 

12440
03:47:34,000 --> 03:47:34,870
this is taken for granted maybe but
but

12441
03:47:34,870 --> 03:47:34,880
but
 

12442
03:47:34,880 --> 03:47:36,550
but
there's 10 million

12443
03:47:36,550 --> 03:47:36,560
there's 10 million
 

12444
03:47:36,560 --> 03:47:39,990

is a huge is amazing privilege right and
 

12452
03:47:46,080 --> 03:47:47,990
is a huge is amazing privilege right and
you should be thanking them

12453
03:47:47,990 --> 03:47:48,000

and and you should respect their time
 

12456
03:47:50,479 --> 03:47:52,229
and and you should respect their time
it's interesting like everything you

12457
03:47:52,229 --> 03:47:52,239
it's interesting like everything you
 

12458
03:47:52,239 --> 03:47:53,910
it's interesting like everything you
said is very interesting but of course

12459
03:47:53,910 --> 03:47:53,920
said is very interesting but of course
 

12460
03:47:53,920 --> 03:47:55,429
said is very interesting but of course
from my perspective and probably from

12461
03:47:55,429 --> 03:47:55,439
from my perspective and probably from
 

12462
03:47:55,439 --> 03:47:57,189
from my perspective and probably from
your perspective

12463
03:47:57,189 --> 03:47:57,199
your perspective
 

12464
03:47:57,199 --> 03:47:59,990
your perspective
my actual life has nothing to do with

12465
03:47:59,990 --> 03:48:00,000
my actual life has nothing to do with
 

12466
03:48:00,000 --> 03:48:02,229
my actual life has nothing to do with
it's just being focused on stuff and uh

12467
03:48:02,229 --> 03:48:02,239
it's just being focused on stuff and uh
 

12468
03:48:02,239 --> 03:48:05,429
it's just being focused on stuff and uh
in my case it's like focus on

12469
03:48:05,429 --> 03:48:05,439
in my case it's like focus on
 

12470
03:48:05,439 --> 03:48:07,990
in my case it's like focus on
doing the thing i really enjoy doing

12471
03:48:07,990 --> 03:48:08,000
doing the thing i really enjoy doing
 

12472
03:48:08,000 --> 03:48:09,750
doing the thing i really enjoy doing
and being myself

12473
03:48:09,750 --> 03:48:09,760
and being myself
 

12474
03:48:09,760 --> 03:48:11,349
and being myself
and not caring about anything else like

12475
03:48:11,349 --> 03:48:11,359
and not caring about anything else like
 

12476
03:48:11,359 --> 03:48:13,030
and not caring about anything else like
i don't care about views or likes or

12477
03:48:13,030 --> 03:48:13,040
i don't care about views or likes or
 

12478
03:48:13,040 --> 03:48:15,269
i don't care about views or likes or
attention

12479
03:48:15,269 --> 03:48:15,279
attention
 

12480
03:48:15,279 --> 03:48:17,349
attention
and that just maintaining that focus is

12481
03:48:17,349 --> 03:48:17,359
and that just maintaining that focus is
 

12482
03:48:17,359 --> 03:48:19,110
and that just maintaining that focus is
the way from an individual perspective

12483
03:48:19,110 --> 03:48:19,120
the way from an individual perspective
 

12484
03:48:19,120 --> 03:48:20,870
the way from an individual perspective
you live that life

12485
03:48:20,870 --> 03:48:20,880
you live that life
 

12486
03:48:20,880 --> 03:48:23,830
you live that life
but yeah it does seem that there's

12487
03:48:23,830 --> 03:48:23,840
but yeah it does seem that there's
 

12488
03:48:23,840 --> 03:48:26,309
but yeah it does seem that there's
the world and technology is rewarding

12489
03:48:26,309 --> 03:48:26,319
the world and technology is rewarding
 

12490
03:48:26,319 --> 03:48:28,550
the world and technology is rewarding
the specialization and creating bigger

12491
03:48:28,550 --> 03:48:28,560
the specialization and creating bigger
 

12492
03:48:28,560 --> 03:48:30,389
the specialization and creating bigger
and bigger platforms for the different

12493
03:48:30,389 --> 03:48:30,399
and bigger platforms for the different
 

12494
03:48:30,399 --> 03:48:32,710
and bigger platforms for the different
specializations and

12495
03:48:32,710 --> 03:48:32,720
specializations and
 

12496
03:48:32,720 --> 03:48:34,389
specializations and
and that yeah and then that lifts all

12497
03:48:34,389 --> 03:48:34,399
and that yeah and then that lifts all
 

12498
03:48:34,399 --> 03:48:35,349
and that yeah and then that lifts all
both actually because the

12499
03:48:35,349 --> 03:48:35,359
both actually because the
 

12500
03:48:35,359 --> 03:48:37,349
both actually because the
specializations get better and better

12501
03:48:37,349 --> 03:48:37,359
specializations get better and better
 

12502
03:48:37,359 --> 03:48:39,269
specializations get better and better
and better at teaching people to do

12503
03:48:39,269 --> 03:48:39,279
and better at teaching people to do
 

12504
03:48:39,279 --> 03:48:40,870
and better at teaching people to do
specific things and they educate

12505
03:48:40,870 --> 03:48:40,880
specific things and they educate
 

12506
03:48:40,880 --> 03:48:43,189
specific things and they educate
themselves and it's just everybody gets

12507
03:48:43,189 --> 03:48:43,199
themselves and it's just everybody gets
 

12508
03:48:43,199 --> 03:48:45,110
themselves and it's just everybody gets
more and more knowledgeable and more and

12509
03:48:45,110 --> 03:48:45,120
more and more knowledgeable and more and
 

12510
03:48:45,120 --> 03:48:46,309
more and more knowledgeable and more and
more empowered

12511
03:48:46,309 --> 03:48:46,319
more empowered
 

12512
03:48:46,319 --> 03:48:49,030
more empowered
the reward for authenticity more than

12513
03:48:49,030 --> 03:48:49,040
the reward for authenticity more than
 

12514
03:48:49,040 --> 03:48:51,910
the reward for authenticity more than
offsets the specificity with which you

12515
03:48:51,910 --> 03:48:51,920
offsets the specificity with which you
 

12516
03:48:51,920 --> 03:48:53,910
offsets the specificity with which you
pursue your mission it's like that's

12517
03:48:53,910 --> 03:48:53,920
pursue your mission it's like that's
 

12518
03:48:53,920 --> 03:48:54,870
pursue your mission it's like that's
true like

12519
03:48:54,870 --> 03:48:54,880
true like
 

12520
03:48:54,880 --> 03:48:56,469
true like
yeah another way to say it is like

12521
03:48:56,469 --> 03:48:56,479
yeah another way to say it is like
 

12522
03:48:56,479 --> 03:48:58,710
yeah another way to say it is like
nobody wants to read advertising

12523
03:48:58,710 --> 03:48:58,720
nobody wants to read advertising
 

12524
03:48:58,720 --> 03:49:00,389
nobody wants to read advertising
like if you if you were to spend 100

12525
03:49:00,389 --> 03:49:00,399
like if you if you were to spend 100
 

12526
03:49:00,399 --> 03:49:04,070
like if you if you were to spend 100
million dollars advertising your thing

12527
03:49:04,070 --> 03:49:04,080
million dollars advertising your thing
 

12528
03:49:04,080 --> 03:49:05,590
million dollars advertising your thing
i probably wouldn't want to watch it

12529
03:49:05,590 --> 03:49:05,600
i probably wouldn't want to watch it
 

12530
03:49:05,600 --> 03:49:06,710
i probably wouldn't want to watch it
yeah

12531
03:49:06,710 --> 03:49:06,720
yeah
 

12532
03:49:06,720 --> 03:49:09,429
yeah
but that's fascinating yeah

12533
03:49:09,429 --> 03:49:09,439
but that's fascinating yeah
 

12534
03:49:09,439 --> 03:49:11,429
but that's fascinating yeah
we see the death of that yeah and so

12535
03:49:11,429 --> 03:49:11,439
we see the death of that yeah and so
 

12536
03:49:11,439 --> 03:49:14,710
we see the death of that yeah and so
that the commercial shows are losing

12537
03:49:14,710 --> 03:49:14,720
that the commercial shows are losing
 

12538
03:49:14,720 --> 03:49:17,750
that the commercial shows are losing
their audiences and the authentic

12539
03:49:17,750 --> 03:49:17,760
their audiences and the authentic
 

12540
03:49:17,760 --> 03:49:21,110
their audiences and the authentic
specialists or the authentic artists are

12541
03:49:21,110 --> 03:49:21,120
specialists or the authentic artists are
 

12542
03:49:21,120 --> 03:49:24,389
specialists or the authentic artists are
are gaining their audience

12543
03:49:24,389 --> 03:49:24,399
are gaining their audience
 

12544
03:49:24,399 --> 03:49:26,309
are gaining their audience
and that's a beautiful thing

12545
03:49:26,309 --> 03:49:26,319
and that's a beautiful thing
 

12546
03:49:26,319 --> 03:49:29,349
and that's a beautiful thing
speaking of deep thinking um

12547
03:49:29,349 --> 03:49:29,359
speaking of deep thinking um
 

12548
03:49:29,359 --> 03:49:32,710
speaking of deep thinking um
you're just a human your life ends

12549
03:49:32,710 --> 03:49:32,720
you're just a human your life ends
 

12550
03:49:32,720 --> 03:49:35,750
you're just a human your life ends
you've uh accumulated so much wisdom

12551
03:49:35,750 --> 03:49:35,760
you've uh accumulated so much wisdom
 

12552
03:49:35,760 --> 03:49:37,269
you've uh accumulated so much wisdom
so much money

12553
03:49:37,269 --> 03:49:37,279
so much money
 

12554
03:49:37,279 --> 03:49:39,030
so much money
but the right ends do you think about

12555
03:49:39,030 --> 03:49:39,040
but the right ends do you think about
 

12556
03:49:39,040 --> 03:49:41,510
but the right ends do you think about
that do you do you ponder your death

12557
03:49:41,510 --> 03:49:41,520
that do you do you ponder your death
 

12558
03:49:41,520 --> 03:49:43,429

of
 

12578
03:50:02,720 --> 03:50:05,670
of
a more perfect monetary system

12579
03:50:05,670 --> 03:50:05,680
a more perfect monetary system
 

12580
03:50:05,680 --> 03:50:07,750
a more perfect monetary system
then maybe that foundation will go on

12581
03:50:07,750 --> 03:50:07,760
then maybe that foundation will go on
 

12582
03:50:07,760 --> 03:50:09,269
then maybe that foundation will go on
forever

12583
03:50:09,269 --> 03:50:09,279
forever
 

12584
03:50:09,279 --> 03:50:10,950
forever
right the idea

12585
03:50:10,950 --> 03:50:10,960
right the idea
 

12586
03:50:10,960 --> 03:50:12,950
right the idea
the foundation of the idea so not just

12587
03:50:12,950 --> 03:50:12,960
the foundation of the idea so not just
 

12588
03:50:12,960 --> 03:50:15,030
the foundation of the idea so not just
the the

12589
03:50:15,030 --> 03:50:15,040
the the
 

12590
03:50:15,040 --> 03:50:16,950
the the
each of the foundations

12591
03:50:16,950 --> 03:50:16,960
each of the foundations
 

12592
03:50:16,960 --> 03:50:18,790
each of the foundations
it's not clear we're on the s-curve of a

12593
03:50:18,790 --> 03:50:18,800
it's not clear we're on the s-curve of a
 

12594
03:50:18,800 --> 03:50:21,269
it's not clear we're on the s-curve of a
mortal life yet like that's a biological

12595
03:50:21,269 --> 03:50:21,279
mortal life yet like that's a biological
 

12596
03:50:21,279 --> 03:50:23,349
mortal life yet like that's a biological
question and you ask that you know on

12597
03:50:23,349 --> 03:50:23,359
question and you ask that you know on
 

12598
03:50:23,359 --> 03:50:26,070
question and you ask that you know on
some of your other interviews a lot

12599
03:50:26,070 --> 03:50:26,080
some of your other interviews a lot
 

12600
03:50:26,080 --> 03:50:28,469
some of your other interviews a lot
i think that we are on the threshold of

12601
03:50:28,469 --> 03:50:28,479
i think that we are on the threshold of
 

12602
03:50:28,479 --> 03:50:29,670
i think that we are on the threshold of
um

12603
03:50:29,670 --> 03:50:29,680
um
 

12604
03:50:29,680 --> 03:50:33,750
um
of immortal life for ideas or mortal

12605
03:50:33,750 --> 03:50:33,760
of immortal life for ideas or mortal
 

12606
03:50:33,760 --> 03:50:36,870
of immortal life for ideas or mortal
life for certain institutions

12607
03:50:36,870 --> 03:50:36,880
life for certain institutions
 

12608
03:50:36,880 --> 03:50:39,429
life for certain institutions
or computer programs so if we can fix

12609
03:50:39,429 --> 03:50:39,439
or computer programs so if we can fix
 

12610
03:50:39,439 --> 03:50:42,790
or computer programs so if we can fix
the money then you can create um

12611
03:50:42,790 --> 03:50:42,800
the money then you can create um
 

12612
03:50:42,800 --> 03:50:45,429
the money then you can create um
a technically perfected endowment

12613
03:50:45,429 --> 03:50:45,439
a technically perfected endowment
 

12614
03:50:45,439 --> 03:50:46,950
a technically perfected endowment
and then

12615
03:50:46,950 --> 03:50:46,960
and then
 

12616
03:50:46,960 --> 03:50:48,550
and then
the question really is what are your

12617
03:50:48,550 --> 03:50:48,560
the question really is what are your
 

12618
03:50:48,560 --> 03:50:50,870
the question really is what are your
ideas what do you want to leave behind

12619
03:50:50,870 --> 03:50:50,880
ideas what do you want to leave behind
 

12620
03:50:50,880 --> 03:50:52,550
ideas what do you want to leave behind
and so if it's a park

12621
03:50:52,550 --> 03:50:52,560
and so if it's a park
 

12622
03:50:52,560 --> 03:50:54,870
and so if it's a park
then you endow the park right if it's if

12623
03:50:54,870 --> 03:50:54,880
then you endow the park right if it's if
 

12624
03:50:54,880 --> 03:50:56,950
then you endow the park right if it's if
it's free education you endow that if

12625
03:50:56,950 --> 03:50:56,960
it's free education you endow that if
 

12626
03:50:56,960 --> 03:50:57,830
it's free education you endow that if
it's

12627
03:50:57,830 --> 03:50:57,840
it's
 

12628
03:50:57,840 --> 03:51:00,070
it's
if it's some other

12629
03:51:00,070 --> 03:51:00,080
if it's some other
 

12630
03:51:00,080 --> 03:51:03,269
if it's some other
ethical idea right does it make you sad

12631
03:51:03,269 --> 03:51:03,279
ethical idea right does it make you sad
 

12632
03:51:03,279 --> 03:51:04,950
ethical idea right does it make you sad
that

12633
03:51:04,950 --> 03:51:04,960
that
 

12634
03:51:04,960 --> 03:51:06,950
that
there's something that you've

12635
03:51:06,950 --> 03:51:06,960
there's something that you've
 

12636
03:51:06,960 --> 03:51:08,070
there's something that you've
endowed

12637
03:51:08,070 --> 03:51:08,080
endowed
 

12638
03:51:08,080 --> 03:51:10,950
endowed
some very powerful idea

12639
03:51:10,950 --> 03:51:10,960
some very powerful idea
 

12640
03:51:10,960 --> 03:51:13,830
some very powerful idea
of digital energy that you put out into

12641
03:51:13,830 --> 03:51:13,840
of digital energy that you put out into
 

12642
03:51:13,840 --> 03:51:15,349
of digital energy that you put out into
the you help

12643
03:51:15,349 --> 03:51:15,359
the you help
 

12644
03:51:15,359 --> 03:51:17,269
the you help
put it into the world

12645
03:51:17,269 --> 03:51:17,279
put it into the world
 

12646
03:51:17,279 --> 03:51:20,870
put it into the world
and your mind your conscious mind

12647
03:51:20,870 --> 03:51:20,880
and your mind your conscious mind
 

12648
03:51:20,880 --> 03:51:23,429
and your mind your conscious mind
will no longer be there to

12649
03:51:23,429 --> 03:51:23,439
will no longer be there to
 

12650
03:51:23,439 --> 03:51:25,189
will no longer be there to
experience it

12651
03:51:25,189 --> 03:51:25,199
experience it
 

12652
03:51:25,199 --> 03:51:27,110
experience it
it's just gone forever

12653
03:51:27,110 --> 03:51:27,120
it's just gone forever
 

12654
03:51:27,120 --> 03:51:30,070
it's just gone forever
i'd rather think that the um

12655
03:51:30,070 --> 03:51:30,080
i'd rather think that the um
 

12656
03:51:30,080 --> 03:51:32,469
i'd rather think that the um
the thing that satoshi taught us is you

12657
03:51:32,469 --> 03:51:32,479
the thing that satoshi taught us is you
 

12658
03:51:32,479 --> 03:51:34,150
the thing that satoshi taught us is you
should do your part

12659
03:51:34,150 --> 03:51:34,160
should do your part
 

12660
03:51:34,160 --> 03:51:36,070
should do your part
during some phase of the journey and

12661
03:51:36,070 --> 03:51:36,080
during some phase of the journey and
 

12662
03:51:36,080 --> 03:51:38,950
during some phase of the journey and
then you should get out of the way

12663
03:51:38,950 --> 03:51:38,960
then you should get out of the way
 

12664
03:51:38,960 --> 03:51:41,670
then you should get out of the way
and yeah i think steve jobs said

12665
03:51:41,670 --> 03:51:41,680
and yeah i think steve jobs said
 

12666
03:51:41,680 --> 03:51:44,630
and yeah i think steve jobs said
something similar to that effect

12667
03:51:44,630 --> 03:51:44,640
something similar to that effect
 

12668
03:51:44,640 --> 03:51:46,790
something similar to that effect
in a very very famous speech one day

12669
03:51:46,790 --> 03:51:46,800
in a very very famous speech one day
 

12670
03:51:46,800 --> 03:51:49,110
in a very very famous speech one day
which is you know death is a natural

12671
03:51:49,110 --> 03:51:49,120
which is you know death is a natural
 

12672
03:51:49,120 --> 03:51:50,870
which is you know death is a natural
part of life and it makes way for the

12673
03:51:50,870 --> 03:51:50,880
part of life and it makes way for the
 

12674
03:51:50,880 --> 03:51:53,269
part of life and it makes way for the
next generation

12675
03:51:53,269 --> 03:51:53,279
next generation
 

12676
03:51:53,279 --> 03:51:55,990
next generation
and uh i i think

12677
03:51:55,990 --> 03:51:56,000
and uh i i think
 

12678
03:51:56,000 --> 03:51:57,590
and uh i i think
the goal is you upgrade the world right

12679
03:51:57,590 --> 03:51:57,600
the goal is you upgrade the world right
 

12680
03:51:57,600 --> 03:51:59,349
the goal is you upgrade the world right
you leave it a better place but you get

12681
03:51:59,349 --> 03:51:59,359
you leave it a better place but you get
 

12682
03:51:59,359 --> 03:52:02,550
you leave it a better place but you get
out of the way and uh

12683
03:52:02,550 --> 03:52:02,560
out of the way and uh
 

12684
03:52:02,560 --> 03:52:05,030
out of the way and uh
i think when um

12685
03:52:05,030 --> 03:52:05,040
i think when um
 

12686
03:52:05,040 --> 03:52:07,510
i think when um
when that breaks down

12687
03:52:07,510 --> 03:52:07,520
when that breaks down
 

12688
03:52:07,520 --> 03:52:10,150
when that breaks down
you know bad things happen

12689
03:52:10,150 --> 03:52:10,160
you know bad things happen
 

12690
03:52:10,160 --> 03:52:12,229
you know bad things happen
i think nature cleanses itself there's a

12691
03:52:12,229 --> 03:52:12,239
i think nature cleanses itself there's a
 

12692
03:52:12,239 --> 03:52:14,870
i think nature cleanses itself there's a
cycle of life

12693
03:52:14,870 --> 03:52:14,880
cycle of life
 

12694
03:52:14,880 --> 03:52:17,830
cycle of life
and speaking one of great people who did

12695
03:52:17,830 --> 03:52:17,840
and speaking one of great people who did
 

12696
03:52:17,840 --> 03:52:19,110
and speaking one of great people who did
also get out of the way is george

of human civilization it seems like
 

12718
03:52:40,479 --> 03:52:42,710
of human civilization it seems like
we're engineers at heart we'll build

12719
03:52:42,710 --> 03:52:42,720
we're engineers at heart we'll build
 

12720
03:52:42,720 --> 03:52:44,550
we're engineers at heart we'll build
