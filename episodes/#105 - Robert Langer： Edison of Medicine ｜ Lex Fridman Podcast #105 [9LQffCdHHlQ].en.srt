00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:23,300
you and there's something magical about
about science I mean making discoveries

166
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:23,310
about science I mean making discoveries
 

167
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,670
about science I mean making discoveries
and things like that you know so on then

168
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:25,680
and things like that you know so on then
 

169
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,500
and things like that you know so on then
on the magic side is there some kind of

170
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:27,510
on the magic side is there some kind of
 

171
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:29,810
on the magic side is there some kind of
engineering scientific process to the

172
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:29,820
engineering scientific process to the
 

173
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,790
engineering scientific process to the
tricks themselves do you see because

174
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:31,800
tricks themselves do you see because
 

175
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:36,100
tricks themselves do you see because
there's a duality to it one is your the

176
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:36,110
there's a duality to it one is your the
 

177
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:39,020
there's a duality to it one is your the
your you're sort of the person inside

178
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:39,030
your you're sort of the person inside
 

179
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,610
your you're sort of the person inside
there knows how the whole thing works

180
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:40,620
there knows how the whole thing works
 

181
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,650
there knows how the whole thing works
how the universe of the magic trick

182
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:42,660
how the universe of the magic trick
 

183
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,990
how the universe of the magic trick
works and then from the outside observer

184
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:45,000
works and then from the outside observer
 

185
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,640
works and then from the outside observer
which is kind of the role of the

186
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:46,650
which is kind of the role of the
 

187
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:49,520
which is kind of the role of the
scientists you the people that observe

188
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:49,530
scientists you the people that observe
 

189
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,560
scientists you the people that observe
the magic trick don't know at least

190
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:51,570
the magic trick don't know at least
 

191
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:53,930
the magic trick don't know at least
initially anything that's going on do

192
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:53,940
initially anything that's going on do
 

193
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,000
initially anything that's going on do
you see that kind of duality well I

194
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,010
you see that kind of duality well I
 

195
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:57,500
you see that kind of duality well I
think the duality that I see is

196
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:57,510
think the duality that I see is
 

197
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:59,390
think the duality that I see is
fascination you know I think of it you

198
00:03:59,390 --> 00:03:59,400
fascination you know I think of it you
 

199
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,390
fascination you know I think of it you
know when I watch Magic myself I'm

200
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:02,400
know when I watch Magic myself I'm
 

201
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,060
know when I watch Magic myself I'm
always fascinated by it sometimes it's a

202
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:05,070
always fascinated by it sometimes it's a
 

203
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,470
always fascinated by it sometimes it's a
puzzle to think how it's done but just

204
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:06,480
puzzle to think how it's done but just
 

205
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,750
puzzle to think how it's done but just
the sheer fact that's something that you

206
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:08,760
the sheer fact that's something that you
 

207
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,790
the sheer fact that's something that you
never thought could happen does happen

208
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:10,800
never thought could happen does happen
 

209
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,310
never thought could happen does happen
and I think about that in science too

210
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:13,320
and I think about that in science too
 

211
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,860
and I think about that in science too
you know sometimes you it's something

212
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:15,870
you know sometimes you it's something
 

213
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:19,250
you know sometimes you it's something
that you might dream about and helping

214
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:19,260
that you might dream about and helping
 

215
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,469
that you might dream about and helping
to discover maybe you do or in some way

216
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:21,479
to discover maybe you do or in some way
 

217
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:24,710
to discover maybe you do or in some way
or form what is the most amazing magic

218
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:24,720
or form what is the most amazing magic
 

219
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,300
or form what is the most amazing magic
trick you've ever seen

220
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:26,310
trick you've ever seen
 

221
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:28,400
trick you've ever seen
well there's one I like which is called

222
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:28,410
well there's one I like which is called
 

223
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:31,340
well there's one I like which is called
the invisible pack and the way it works

224
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:31,350
the invisible pack and the way it works
 

225
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:34,930
the invisible pack and the way it works
is you have this pack and you hold it up

226
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:34,940
is you have this pack and you hold it up
 

227
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:38,270
is you have this pack and you hold it up
but first you say to somebody is this is

228
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:38,280
but first you say to somebody is this is
 

229
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,450
but first you say to somebody is this is
invisible and this deck and you say well

230
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:41,460
invisible and this deck and you say well
 

231
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:44,090
invisible and this deck and you say well
shuffle it and I shuffle it but you know

232
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:44,100
shuffle it and I shuffle it but you know
 

233
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,800
shuffle it and I shuffle it but you know
there's sort of make-believe and then

234
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:45,810
there's sort of make-believe and then
 

235
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,990
there's sort of make-believe and then
you say okay I'd like you to pick a card

236
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:48,000
you say okay I'd like you to pick a card
 

237
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,590
you say okay I'd like you to pick a card
any card

238
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:48,600
any card
 

239
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,140
any card
and show it to me and you show it to me

240
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:51,150
and show it to me and you show it to me
 

241
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:55,070
and show it to me and you show it to me
and and I look at it and let's say it's

242
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:55,080
and and I look at it and let's say it's
 

243
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,260
and and I look at it and let's say it's
the three of hearts and said we'll put

244
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:57,270
the three of hearts and said we'll put
 

245
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,340
the three of hearts and said we'll put
it back in the deck but what I'd like

246
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:58,350
it back in the deck but what I'd like
 

247
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:00,469
it back in the deck but what I'd like
you to do is turn it upside down from

248
00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:00,479
you to do is turn it upside down from
 

249
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,779
you to do is turn it upside down from
every other cards in the deck so they

250
00:05:02,779 --> 00:05:02,789
every other cards in the deck so they
 

251
00:05:02,789 --> 00:05:05,270
every other cards in the deck so they
they do that imaginary and I said you

252
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:05,280
they do that imaginary and I said you
 

253
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,800
they do that imaginary and I said you
want to shuffle it again they shuffle it

254
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:06,810
want to shuffle it again they shuffle it
 

255
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:09,290
want to shuffle it again they shuffle it
and I said well so there's still one

256
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:09,300
and I said well so there's still one
 

257
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,390
and I said well so there's still one
card upside down from every other card

258
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:11,400
card upside down from every other card
 

259
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,770
card upside down from every other card
in the deck I said what is that and they

260
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:12,780
in the deck I said what is that and they
 

261
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,779
in the deck I said what is that and they
said all three hearts so it just so

262
00:05:14,779 --> 00:05:14,789
said all three hearts so it just so
 

263
00:05:14,789 --> 00:05:16,490
said all three hearts so it just so
happens in my back pocket I have this

264
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:16,500
happens in my back pocket I have this
 

265
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,140
happens in my back pocket I have this
deck it's you know it's a real deck I

266
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:18,150
deck it's you know it's a real deck I
 

267
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:20,090
deck it's you know it's a real deck I
show - you know it's just

268
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:20,100
show - you know it's just
 

269
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,800
show - you know it's just
open it up and there's just one card

270
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:21,810
open it up and there's just one card
 

271
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:26,020
open it up and there's just one card
upside down and it's the three of hearts

272
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:26,030

 

273
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:31,880

and and you can do this trick I can i-55

well it's interesting I mean I've had
 

303
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:09,440
well it's interesting I mean I've had
plenty of rejection to you know I but I

304
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:09,450
plenty of rejection to you know I but I
 

305
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:11,720
plenty of rejection to you know I but I
suppose one way I think about this is

306
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:11,730
suppose one way I think about this is
 

307
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:14,450
suppose one way I think about this is
that when I first started and this

308
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:14,460
that when I first started and this
 

309
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,220
that when I first started and this
certainly had an impact both ways you

know I first started we made two big
 

313
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,320
know I first started we made two big
discoveries and they were kind of

discoveries and they were kind of
 

315
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:23,930
discoveries and they were kind of
interrelated I mean one was I was trying

advisor Judah Folkman substances that
could stop blood vessels from growing

322
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:29,760
could stop blood vessels from growing
 

323
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:35,000
could stop blood vessels from growing
and nobody done that before and so that

324
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,010
and nobody done that before and so that
 

325
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:37,250
and nobody done that before and so that
was part a let's say a Part B is we had

326
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:37,260
was part a let's say a Part B is we had
 

327
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,680
was part a let's say a Part B is we had
to develop a way to study that and what

328
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:39,690
to develop a way to study that and what
 

329
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,990
to develop a way to study that and what
was critical to study that was to have a

330
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:42,000
was critical to study that was to have a
 

331
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,900
was critical to study that was to have a
way to slowly release those substances

332
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:44,910
way to slowly release those substances
 

333
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:48,260
way to slowly release those substances
for you know more than a day I you know

334
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:48,270
for you know more than a day I you know
 

335
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:50,330

maybe months and that had never been

336
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:50,340
maybe months and that had never been
 

337
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:53,360
maybe months and that had never been
done before either so we published the

338
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:53,370
done before either so we published the
 

339
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:55,490
done before either so we published the
first one we sent to nature the journal

340
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:55,500
first one we sent to nature the journal
 

341
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:59,930
first one we sent to nature the journal
and they rejected it and then we sent it

342
00:06:59,930 --> 00:06:59,940
and they rejected it and then we sent it
 

343
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,000
and they rejected it and then we sent it
revise tenets of science and they

344
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,010
revise tenets of science and they
 

345
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:05,930
revise tenets of science and they
accepted it and the other the opposite

346
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:05,940
accepted it and the other the opposite
 

347
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,550
accepted it and the other the opposite
happened we sent it to science and they

348
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:07,560
happened we sent it to science and they
 

349
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,870
happened we sent it to science and they
rejected it and then we sent it to

rejected it and then we sent it to
 

351
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,630
rejected it and then we sent it to
nature and they accepted it but I have

352
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:11,640
nature and they accepted it but I have
 

353
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,100
nature and they accepted it but I have
to tell you when we got the rejections

354
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:13,110
to tell you when we got the rejections
 

355
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:15,020
to tell you when we got the rejections
it was really upsetting I thought you

you're full of self-doubt and did you
 

381
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:49,700
you're full of self-doubt and did you
believe that maybe this idea is actually

00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:49,710
believe that maybe this idea is actually
 

383
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:52,040
believe that maybe this idea is actually
quite terrible that it could been done

00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,050
quite terrible that it could been done
 

385
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:53,839
quite terrible that it could been done
much better or is the underlying

confidence what was the feelings well
 

389
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,670
confidence what was the feelings well
you feel to feel depressed that I felt

00:07:58,670 --> 00:07:58,680
you feel to feel depressed that I felt
 

391
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,010
you feel to feel depressed that I felt
the same way when I got grants rejected

392
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:01,020
the same way when I got grants rejected
 

393
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,860
the same way when I got grants rejected
which I did a lot in the beginning I

394
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:02,870
which I did a lot in the beginning I
 

395
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:05,659
which I did a lot in the beginning I
guess part of me you know you have

396
00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:05,669
guess part of me you know you have
 

397
00:08:05,669 --> 00:08:09,110
guess part of me you know you have
multiple emotions one is being sad and

398
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:09,120
multiple emotions one is being sad and
 

399
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,110
multiple emotions one is being sad and
being upset and also being maybe a

400
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:12,120
being upset and also being maybe a
 

401
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,029
being upset and also being maybe a
little bit angry because the you to feel

the reviewers didn't get it but then as

404
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:16,530
the reviewers didn't get it but then as
 

405
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:18,050
the reviewers didn't get it but then as
I thought about it more I thought well

406
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:18,060
I thought about it more I thought well
 

407
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,520
I thought about it more I thought well
maybe I just didn't explain it well

408
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:19,530
maybe I just didn't explain it well
 

409
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:22,279
maybe I just didn't explain it well
enough and you know that you go through

410
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:22,289
enough and you know that you go through
 

411
00:08:22,289 --> 00:08:24,830
enough and you know that you go through
stages and so you say well okay I'll

412
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:24,840
stages and so you say well okay I'll
 

413
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,029
stages and so you say well okay I'll
explain it better next time and

414
00:08:26,029 --> 00:08:26,039
explain it better next time and
 

415
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:27,920
explain it better next time and
certainly you get reviews and what you

416
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:27,930
certainly you get reviews and what you
 

417
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:30,110
certainly you get reviews and what you
get the reviews you see what they either

418
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:30,120
get the reviews you see what they either
 

419
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,820
get the reviews you see what they either
didn't like or didn't understand and

420
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:31,830
didn't like or didn't understand and
 

421
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:33,380
didn't like or didn't understand and
then you try to incorporate that into

422
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:33,390
then you try to incorporate that into
 

423
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,719
then you try to incorporate that into
your next versions mmm you've given

424
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:35,729
your next versions mmm you've given
 

425
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:38,209
your next versions mmm you've given
advice to students to do something big

426
00:08:38,209 --> 00:08:38,219
advice to students to do something big
 

427
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:39,740
advice to students to do something big
do something that really can change the

428
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:39,750
do something that really can change the
 

429
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,339
do something that really can change the
world rather than something incremental

how did you yourself seek out such ideas

432
00:08:45,319 --> 00:08:45,329
how did you yourself seek out such ideas
 

433
00:08:45,329 --> 00:08:48,440
how did you yourself seek out such ideas
is there a process is there a sort of a

00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:48,450
is there a process is there a sort of a
 

435
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:50,840
is there a process is there a sort of a
rigorous process or is it more

00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:50,850
rigorous process or is it more

00:08:58,970 --> 00:08:58,980
its seeing other people like I mentioned

00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,740
its seeing other people like I mentioned
dr. Folkman he was my post doctoral

444
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:00,750
dr. Folkman he was my post doctoral
 

445
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,480
dr. Folkman he was my post doctoral
adviser he was very good at that you

446
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:02,490
adviser he was very good at that you
 

447
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:05,060
adviser he was very good at that you
could sort of see that he had big ideas

448
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:05,070
could sort of see that he had big ideas
 

449
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:06,560
could sort of see that he had big ideas
and I certainly met a lot of people who

450
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:06,570
and I certainly met a lot of people who
 

451
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:08,990
and I certainly met a lot of people who
didn't and and I think you could spot an

452
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:09,000
didn't and and I think you could spot an
 

453
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,760
didn't and and I think you could spot an
idea that might have potential when you

454
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:10,770
idea that might have potential when you
 

455
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:12,410
idea that might have potential when you
see it you know because it could have a

456
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:12,420
see it you know because it could have a
 

457
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,810
see it you know because it could have a
very broad implications where a lot of

458
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:14,820
very broad implications where a lot of
 

459
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,970
very broad implications where a lot of
people might just keep doing derivative

460
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:16,980
people might just keep doing derivative
 

461
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:22,040
people might just keep doing derivative
stuff and so but it's not something that

462
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:22,050
stuff and so but it's not something that
 

463
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:25,490
stuff and so but it's not something that
I've ever done systematically I don't

464
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:25,500
I've ever done systematically I don't
 

465
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,760
I've ever done systematically I don't
think so in the space of ideas how many

466
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:28,770
think so in the space of ideas how many
 

467
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:31,250
think so in the space of ideas how many
are just when you see them it's just

468
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:31,260
are just when you see them it's just
 

469
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,470
are just when you see them it's just
magic it's something that you see that

470
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:33,480
magic it's something that you see that
 

471
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,010
magic it's something that you see that
could be impactful if if if you dig

472
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:37,020
could be impactful if if if you dig
 

473
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:39,470
could be impactful if if if you dig
deeper yeah it's it's sort of hard to

474
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:39,480
deeper yeah it's it's sort of hard to
 

475
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,360
deeper yeah it's it's sort of hard to
say because there's there's multiple

476
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:41,370
say because there's there's multiple

00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:43,010
say because there's there's multiple
levels of ideas

478
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:43,020
levels of ideas
 

479
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:47,600
levels of ideas
one type of thing is like a new you know

480
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:47,610
one type of thing is like a new you know
 

481
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:49,740
one type of thing is like a new you know
creation like that you could engineer

482
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:49,750
creation like that you could engineer
 

483
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,450
creation like that you could engineer
tissues for the first time or make

484
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:51,460
tissues for the first time or make
 

485
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,950
tissues for the first time or make
dishes from scratch from the first time

486
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:52,960
dishes from scratch from the first time
 

487
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,350
dishes from scratch from the first time
but another thing is really just deeply

488
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:55,360
but another thing is really just deeply
 

489
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,840
but another thing is really just deeply
understanding something and that's

490
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:57,850
understanding something and that's
 

491
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:01,800
understanding something and that's
important too so and and that may lead

492
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:01,810
important too so and and that may lead
 

493
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:04,530
important too so and and that may lead
to other things so sometimes you could

494
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:04,540
to other things so sometimes you could
 

495
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:07,080
to other things so sometimes you could
think of a new technology or I thought

496
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:07,090
think of a new technology or I thought
 

497
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:09,090
think of a new technology or I thought
of a new technology but other times

498
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:09,100
of a new technology but other times
 

499
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,210
of a new technology but other times
things came from just the process of

500
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:12,220
things came from just the process of
 

501
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,730
things came from just the process of
trying to discover things so it's never

502
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:14,740
trying to discover things so it's never
 

503
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:17,010
trying to discover things so it's never
and and and you don't necessarily know

504
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:17,020
and and and you don't necessarily know
 

505
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,950
and and and you don't necessarily know
like people talk about aha moments but I

506
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:19,960
like people talk about aha moments but I
 

507
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,650
like people talk about aha moments but I
don't know if I've I mean I certainly

508
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:22,660
don't know if I've I mean I certainly
 

509
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,240
don't know if I've I mean I certainly
feel like I've had some ideas that I

510
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:24,250
feel like I've had some ideas that I
 

511
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:27,720
feel like I've had some ideas that I
really like but it's taken me a long

512
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:27,730
really like but it's taken me a long
 

513
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:30,600
really like but it's taken me a long
time to go from the thought process of

514
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:30,610
time to go from the thought process of
 

515
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:34,230
time to go from the thought process of
starting it to all of a sudden knowing

516
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:34,240
starting it to all of a sudden knowing
 

517
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,690
starting it to all of a sudden knowing
that it might work so if you if you take

518
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:36,700
that it might work so if you if you take
 

519
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,970
that it might work so if you if you take
drug delivery for example is the notion

520
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:38,980
drug delivery for example is the notion
 

521
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:41,610
drug delivery for example is the notion
is the initial notion kind of a very

522
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:41,620
is the initial notion kind of a very
 

523
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:44,310
is the initial notion kind of a very
general one that we should be able to do

524
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:44,320
general one that we should be able to do
 

525
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,220
general one that we should be able to do
something like this yeah and then you

526
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:47,230
something like this yeah and then you
 

527
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,560
something like this yeah and then you
start to ask the questions of well how

528
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:49,570
start to ask the questions of well how
 

529
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:51,090
start to ask the questions of well how
would you do it and then and then

530
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:51,100
would you do it and then and then
 

531
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,070
would you do it and then and then
digging and digging and digging I think

532
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:53,080
digging and digging and digging I think
 

533
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,630
digging and digging and digging I think
that's right I think it depends I mean

534
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:54,640
that's right I think it depends I mean
 

535
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,430
that's right I think it depends I mean
there are many different examples the

536
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:56,440
there are many different examples the
 

537
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,829
there are many different examples the
example I gave about delivering large

538
00:10:58,829 --> 00:10:58,839
example I gave about delivering large
 

539
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:01,230
example I gave about delivering large
molecules which we used to study these

540
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:01,240
molecules which we used to study these
 

541
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,050
molecules which we used to study these
blood vessel inhibitors I mean there we

542
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:04,060
blood vessel inhibitors I mean there we
 

543
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,579
blood vessel inhibitors I mean there we
had it invent something that would do

544
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:05,589
had it invent something that would do
 

545
00:11:05,589 --> 00:11:09,720
had it invent something that would do
that but other times it's it's it's

546
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:09,730
that but other times it's it's it's
 

547
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:11,010
that but other times it's it's it's
different sometimes it's really

548
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:11,020
different sometimes it's really
 

549
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,380
different sometimes it's really
understanding what goes on in terms of

550
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:13,390
understanding what goes on in terms of
 

551
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:15,990
understanding what goes on in terms of
understanding the mechanisms and so it's

552
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:16,000
understanding the mechanisms and so it's
 

553
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,880
understanding the mechanisms and so it's
it's it's not a single thing and there

554
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:17,890
it's it's not a single thing and there
 

555
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:19,680
it's it's not a single thing and there
are many different parts to it you know

556
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:19,690
are many different parts to it you know
 

557
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:22,829
are many different parts to it you know
over the years we've invented different

558
00:11:22,829 --> 00:11:22,839
over the years we've invented different
 

559
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:24,890
over the years we've invented different
discover different principles for

560
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:24,900
discover different principles for
 

561
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:28,440
discover different principles for
aerosols for delivering you know genetic

562
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:28,450
aerosols for delivering you know genetic
 

563
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:30,210
aerosols for delivering you know genetic
therapy agents you know all kinds of

564
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:30,220
therapy agents you know all kinds of
 

565
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,910
therapy agents you know all kinds of
things so let's explore some of the key

566
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:32,920
things so let's explore some of the key
 

567
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,350
things so let's explore some of the key
ideas you've touched on in your life

568
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:34,360
ideas you've touched on in your life
 

569
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,140
ideas you've touched on in your life
some let's let's start with the basics

570
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:37,150
some let's let's start with the basics
 

571
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:40,380
some let's let's start with the basics
okay so first let me ask how complicated

572
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:40,390
okay so first let me ask how complicated
 

573
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:42,660
okay so first let me ask how complicated
is the biology and chemistry of the

574
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:42,670
is the biology and chemistry of the
 

575
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:45,420
is the biology and chemistry of the
human body from the perspective of

576
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:45,430
human body from the perspective of
 

577
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:47,010
human body from the perspective of
trying to affect some parts of it in a

578
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:47,020
trying to affect some parts of it in a
 

579
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:49,560
trying to affect some parts of it in a
positive way it's but so that you know

580
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:49,570
positive way it's but so that you know
 

581
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:52,650
positive way it's but so that you know
for me especially coming from the field

582
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:52,660
for me especially coming from the field
 

583
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,120
for me especially coming from the field
of computer science and computer

584
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:54,130
of computer science and computer
 

585
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,639
of computer science and computer
engineering and robotics it's

586
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:56,649
engineering and robotics it's
 

587
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:58,259
engineering and robotics it's
that the human body is exceptionally

588
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:58,269
that the human body is exceptionally
 

589
00:11:58,269 --> 00:12:00,059
that the human body is exceptionally
complicated and how the heck you can

590
00:12:00,059 --> 00:12:00,069
complicated and how the heck you can
 

591
00:12:00,069 --> 00:12:02,280
complicated and how the heck you can
figure out anything is amazing well I

592
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:02,290
figure out anything is amazing well I
 

593
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:03,749
figure out anything is amazing well I
agree with you I think it's super

594
00:12:03,749 --> 00:12:03,759
agree with you I think it's super
 

595
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:05,579
agree with you I think it's super
complicated I mean we're still just

596
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:05,589
complicated I mean we're still just
 

597
00:12:05,589 --> 00:12:08,009
complicated I mean we're still just
scratching the surface in many ways but

598
00:12:08,009 --> 00:12:08,019
scratching the surface in many ways but
 

599
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:09,749
scratching the surface in many ways but
I feel like we have made progress in

600
00:12:09,749 --> 00:12:09,759
I feel like we have made progress in
 

601
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:13,319
I feel like we have made progress in
different ways and some of its by really

602
00:12:13,319 --> 00:12:13,329
different ways and some of its by really
 

603
00:12:13,329 --> 00:12:15,389
different ways and some of its by really
understanding things like we were just

604
00:12:15,389 --> 00:12:15,399
understanding things like we were just
 

605
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:17,549
understanding things like we were just
talking about other times you know you

606
00:12:17,549 --> 00:12:17,559
talking about other times you know you
 

607
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:19,889
talking about other times you know you
might or somebody might we or others

608
00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:19,899
might or somebody might we or others
 

609
00:12:19,899 --> 00:12:22,230
might or somebody might we or others
might invent technologies that might be

610
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:22,240
might invent technologies that might be
 

611
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,629
might invent technologies that might be
helpful on exploring that and I think

612
00:12:24,629 --> 00:12:24,639
helpful on exploring that and I think
 

613
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,150
helpful on exploring that and I think
over many years we've understood things

614
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:27,160
over many years we've understood things
 

615
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,559
over many years we've understood things
better and better but we still have such

616
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:28,569
better and better but we still have such
 

617
00:12:28,569 --> 00:12:31,769
better and better but we still have such
a long ways to go are there I mean if

618
00:12:31,769 --> 00:12:31,779
a long ways to go are there I mean if
 

619
00:12:31,779 --> 00:12:33,119
a long ways to go are there I mean if
you just look are there other things

620
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:33,129
you just look are there other things
 

621
00:12:33,129 --> 00:12:38,129
you just look are there other things
that are there knobs that are reliably

622
00:12:38,129 --> 00:12:38,139
that are there knobs that are reliably
 

623
00:12:38,139 --> 00:12:41,400
that are there knobs that are reliably
controllable about the human body if you

624
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:41,410
controllable about the human body if you
 

625
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:45,749
controllable about the human body if you
could service is there is it so if you

626
00:12:45,749 --> 00:12:45,759
could service is there is it so if you
 

627
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:47,220
could service is there is it so if you
start to think about controlling various

628
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:47,230
start to think about controlling various
 

629
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:50,189
start to think about controlling various
aspects of when we talk about drug

630
00:12:50,189 --> 00:12:50,199
aspects of when we talk about drug
 

631
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:53,189
aspects of when we talk about drug
delivery a little bit but controlling

632
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:53,199
delivery a little bit but controlling
 

633
00:12:53,199 --> 00:12:55,679
delivery a little bit but controlling
various aspects chemically of the human

634
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:55,689
various aspects chemically of the human
 

635
00:12:55,689 --> 00:12:57,840
various aspects chemically of the human
body is there a solid understanding

636
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:57,850
body is there a solid understanding
 

637
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:00,269
body is there a solid understanding
across the populations of humans that

638
00:13:00,269 --> 00:13:00,279
across the populations of humans that
 

639
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,400
across the populations of humans that
are solid reliable knobs that can be

640
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:02,410
are solid reliable knobs that can be
 

641
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:05,129
are solid reliable knobs that can be
controlled I think that's hard to do

642
00:13:05,129 --> 00:13:05,139
controlled I think that's hard to do
 

643
00:13:05,139 --> 00:13:06,900
controlled I think that's hard to do
about on the other hand whenever we make

644
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:06,910
about on the other hand whenever we make
 

645
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,879
about on the other hand whenever we make
a new drug or medical device to a

646
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:08,889
a new drug or medical device to a
 

647
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:10,769
a new drug or medical device to a
certain extent we're doing that you know

648
00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:10,779
certain extent we're doing that you know
 

649
00:13:10,779 --> 00:13:13,379
certain extent we're doing that you know
in a small way what you just said but I

650
00:13:13,379 --> 00:13:13,389
in a small way what you just said but I
 

651
00:13:13,389 --> 00:13:15,480
in a small way what you just said but I
don't know that they're that they're

652
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:15,490
don't know that they're that they're
 

653
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:17,069
don't know that they're that they're
great knobs I mean and we're learning

654
00:13:17,069 --> 00:13:17,079
great knobs I mean and we're learning
 

655
00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:19,410
great knobs I mean and we're learning
about those knobs all the time but if

656
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:19,420
about those knobs all the time but if
 

657
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,509
about those knobs all the time but if
there's a biological pathway or

658
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:21,519
there's a biological pathway or
 

659
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,509
there's a biological pathway or
something that you can affect or

660
00:13:23,509 --> 00:13:23,519
something that you can affect or
 

661
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,249
something that you can affect or
understand I mean then that might be

662
00:13:26,249 --> 00:13:26,259
understand I mean then that might be
 

663
00:13:26,259 --> 00:13:29,040
understand I mean then that might be
such a knob so what is pharmaceutical

664
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:29,050
such a knob so what is pharmaceutical
 

665
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:31,079
such a knob so what is pharmaceutical
drug how do you do

666
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:31,089
drug how do you do
 

667
00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:33,600
drug how do you do
how do you discover a specific one how

668
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:33,610
how do you discover a specific one how
 

669
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:35,429
how do you discover a specific one how
do you test it how do you understand it

670
00:13:35,429 --> 00:13:35,439
do you test it how do you understand it
 

671
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:38,819
do you test it how do you understand it
how do you ship it yeah well I'll give

672
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:38,829
how do you ship it yeah well I'll give
 

673
00:13:38,829 --> 00:13:40,860
how do you ship it yeah well I'll give
an example which goes back to what I

674
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:40,870
an example which goes back to what I
 

675
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:42,900
an example which goes back to what I
said before so when I was doing my

676
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:42,910
said before so when I was doing my
 

677
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:45,329
said before so when I was doing my
postdoctoral work with Judah Folkman we

678
00:13:45,329 --> 00:13:45,339
postdoctoral work with Judah Folkman we
 

679
00:13:45,339 --> 00:13:46,590
postdoctoral work with Judah Folkman we
wanted to come up with drugs that would

680
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:46,600
wanted to come up with drugs that would
 

681
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,090
wanted to come up with drugs that would
stop blood vessels from growing or

682
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:48,100
stop blood vessels from growing or
 

683
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,030
stop blood vessels from growing or
alternatively make them grow and

684
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:50,040
alternatively make them grow and
 

685
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,309
alternatively make them grow and
actually people didn't even believe that

686
00:13:52,309 --> 00:13:52,319
actually people didn't even believe that
 

687
00:13:52,319 --> 00:13:56,280
actually people didn't even believe that
that those things could happen but could

688
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:56,290
that those things could happen but could
 

689
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:58,230
that those things could happen but could
we pause on that for a sec sure what is

690
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:58,240
we pause on that for a sec sure what is
 

691
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,179
we pause on that for a sec sure what is
the blood vessel what does it mean for a

692
00:14:00,179 --> 00:14:00,189
the blood vessel what does it mean for a
 

693
00:14:00,189 --> 00:14:02,220
the blood vessel what does it mean for a
blood vessel to grow and shrink and why

694
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:02,230
blood vessel to grow and shrink and why
 

695
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:04,499
blood vessel to grow and shrink and why
is that important sure so a blood vessel

696
00:14:04,499 --> 00:14:04,509
is that important sure so a blood vessel
 

697
00:14:04,509 --> 00:14:08,280
is that important sure so a blood vessel
is could be an artery or vein or a

698
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:08,290
is could be an artery or vein or a
 

699
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:09,780
is could be an artery or vein or a
capillary

700
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:09,790
capillary
 

701
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:13,830
capillary
and it it you know provides oxygen it

702
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:13,840
and it it you know provides oxygen it
 

703
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:18,090
and it it you know provides oxygen it
provides nutrients gets rid of waste so

704
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:18,100
provides nutrients gets rid of waste so
 

705
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,040
provides nutrients gets rid of waste so
you know two different parts of your

706
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:20,050
you know two different parts of your
 

707
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:22,830
you know two different parts of your
body if you soso the blood vessels end

708
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:22,840
body if you soso the blood vessels end
 

709
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,890
body if you soso the blood vessels end
up being very very important and you

710
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:25,900
up being very very important and you
 

711
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:29,250
up being very very important and you
know if you have cancer blood vessels

712
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:29,260
know if you have cancer blood vessels
 

713
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:31,560
know if you have cancer blood vessels
grow into the tumor and that's part of

714
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:31,570
grow into the tumor and that's part of
 

715
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,030
grow into the tumor and that's part of
what enables the tumor to get bigger and

716
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:33,040
what enables the tumor to get bigger and
 

717
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,090
what enables the tumor to get bigger and
that's also part of what enables the

718
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:36,100
that's also part of what enables the
 

719
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,340
that's also part of what enables the
tumor to metastasize event which means

720
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:38,350
tumor to metastasize event which means
 

721
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,380
tumor to metastasize event which means
spread throughout the body and

722
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:39,390
spread throughout the body and
 

723
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:42,090
spread throughout the body and
ultimately kill somebody so that was

724
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:42,100
ultimately kill somebody so that was
 

725
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,440
ultimately kill somebody so that was
part of what we were trying to do we

726
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:43,450
part of what we were trying to do we
 

727
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,120
part of what we were trying to do we
shot what we wanted to see if we could

728
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:45,130
shot what we wanted to see if we could
 

729
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:47,070
shot what we wanted to see if we could
find substances that could stop that

730
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:47,080
find substances that could stop that
 

731
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,620
find substances that could stop that
from happening so first I mean there are

732
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:49,630
from happening so first I mean there are
 

733
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:51,540
from happening so first I mean there are
many steps first we had to develop a bio

734
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:51,550
many steps first we had to develop a bio
 

735
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:53,790
many steps first we had to develop a bio
essay to study blood vessel growth again

736
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:53,800
essay to study blood vessel growth again
 

737
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,060
essay to study blood vessel growth again
there wasn't one that's where we needed

738
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:56,070
there wasn't one that's where we needed
 

739
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:58,170
there wasn't one that's where we needed
polymer systems because the blood

740
00:14:58,170 --> 00:14:58,180
polymer systems because the blood
 

741
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:02,640
polymer systems because the blood
vessels grew slowly took months that so

742
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:02,650
vessels grew slowly took months that so
 

743
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:04,620
vessels grew slowly took months that so
after we had the polymer system and we

744
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:04,630
after we had the polymer system and we
 

745
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,960
after we had the polymer system and we
had the bioassay then I had isolated

746
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:06,970
had the bioassay then I had isolated
 

747
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:09,450
had the bioassay then I had isolated
many different molecules initially from

748
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:09,460
many different molecules initially from
 

749
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:13,530
many different molecules initially from
cartilage and almost all of them didn't

750
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:13,540
cartilage and almost all of them didn't
 

751
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:16,680
cartilage and almost all of them didn't
work but we were fortunate we found one

752
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:16,690
work but we were fortunate we found one
 

753
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:19,380
work but we were fortunate we found one
it wasn't purified but we found one that

754
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:19,390
it wasn't purified but we found one that
 

755
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:21,720
it wasn't purified but we found one that
did work and that paper that was this

756
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:21,730
did work and that paper that was this
 

757
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:24,210
did work and that paper that was this
paper I mentioned in science in 1976

758
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:24,220
paper I mentioned in science in 1976
 

759
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:26,310
paper I mentioned in science in 1976
those were really the isolation of some

760
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:26,320
those were really the isolation of some
 

761
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,170
those were really the isolation of some
of the very first angiogenesis of blood

762
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:28,180
of the very first angiogenesis of blood
 

763
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:30,480
of the very first angiogenesis of blood
vessel inhibitors so there's a lot of

764
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:30,490
vessel inhibitors so there's a lot of
 

765
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:33,780
vessel inhibitors so there's a lot of
words there yeah that's the the first of

766
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:33,790
words there yeah that's the the first of
 

767
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:37,680
words there yeah that's the the first of
all polymer molecules big big molecules

768
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:37,690
all polymer molecules big big molecules
 

769
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:39,420
all polymer molecules big big molecules
so the water polymers

770
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:39,430
so the water polymers
 

771
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:44,160
so the water polymers
what's bio sa the the what is the

772
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:44,170
what's bio sa the the what is the
 

773
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:45,690
what's bio sa the the what is the
process is trying to isolate this whole

774
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:45,700
process is trying to isolate this whole
 

775
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:46,890
process is trying to isolate this whole
thing simplified to where you can

776
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:46,900
thing simplified to where you can
 

777
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,990
thing simplified to where you can
control and experiment with it polymers

778
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:49,000
control and experiment with it polymers
 

779
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,960
control and experiment with it polymers
are like plastics or like plastics or

780
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:51,970
are like plastics or like plastics or
 

781
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:55,380
are like plastics or like plastics or
rubber what were some of the other

782
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:55,390
rubber what were some of the other
 

783
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:57,420
rubber what were some of the other
questions sorry so a polymer some

784
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:57,430
questions sorry so a polymer some
 

785
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:59,220
questions sorry so a polymer some
plastics and rubber and that means

786
00:15:59,220 --> 00:15:59,230
plastics and rubber and that means
 

787
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:00,990
plastics and rubber and that means
something that has structure and that

788
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:01,000
something that has structure and that
 

789
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,630
something that has structure and that
could be useful for what well in this

790
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:03,640
could be useful for what well in this
 

791
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,250
could be useful for what well in this
case it would be something that could be

792
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:05,260
case it would be something that could be
 

793
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:08,610
case it would be something that could be
useful for delivering a molecule for a

794
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:08,620
useful for delivering a molecule for a
 

795
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:11,130
useful for delivering a molecule for a
long time so it could slowly diffuse out

796
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:11,140
long time so it could slowly diffuse out
 

797
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,680
long time so it could slowly diffuse out
of that at a controlled rate to where

798
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:13,690
of that at a controlled rate to where
 

799
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:15,720
of that at a controlled rate to where
you wanted it to go so then you would

800
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:15,730
you wanted it to go so then you would
 

801
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:17,550
you wanted it to go so then you would
find the ideas that there would be

802
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:17,560
find the ideas that there would be
 

803
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:21,150
find the ideas that there would be
particular blood vessels that you can

804
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:21,160
particular blood vessels that you can
 

805
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,380
particular blood vessels that you can
target say they're connected some

806
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:23,390
target say they're connected some
 

807
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:26,560
target say they're connected some
Auto tumour you could target and over a

808
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:26,570
Auto tumour you could target and over a
 

809
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:30,610
Auto tumour you could target and over a
long period of time to be able to place

810
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:30,620
long period of time to be able to place
 

811
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,740
long period of time to be able to place
the polymer there and it be delivering a

812
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:32,750
the polymer there and it be delivering a
 

813
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:35,230
the polymer there and it be delivering a
certain kind of chemical that's correct

814
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:35,240
certain kind of chemical that's correct
 

815
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,600
certain kind of chemical that's correct
I think what you said it's good so so

816
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:37,610
I think what you said it's good so so
 

817
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:39,880
I think what you said it's good so so
that it would deliver the the molecule

818
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:39,890
that it would deliver the the molecule
 

819
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:41,560
that it would deliver the the molecule
or the chemical that would stop the

820
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:41,570
or the chemical that would stop the
 

821
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,090
or the chemical that would stop the
blood vessels from going over a long

822
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:43,100
blood vessels from going over a long
 

823
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,650
blood vessels from going over a long
enough time so that it really could

824
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:44,660
enough time so that it really could
 

825
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:47,650
enough time so that it really could
happen so that was sort of the what we

826
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:47,660
happen so that was sort of the what we
 

827
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,360
happen so that was sort of the what we
call the bio sa is the way that we would

828
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:49,370
call the bio sa is the way that we would
 

829
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:52,360
call the bio sa is the way that we would
study that so size of what is a by us

830
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:52,370
study that so size of what is a by us
 

831
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:55,630
study that so size of what is a by us
which part is the bio sa all of it in

832
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:55,640
which part is the bio sa all of it in
 

833
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,240
which part is the bio sa all of it in
other words the bio SAS is the way you

834
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:58,250
other words the bio SAS is the way you
 

835
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:02,530
other words the bio SAS is the way you
study blood vessel growth the blood

836
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:02,540
study blood vessel growth the blood
 

837
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,540
study blood vessel growth the blood
vessel growth and you can control this

838
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:04,550
vessel growth and you can control this
 

839
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:06,880
vessel growth and you can control this
somehow with is there an understanding

840
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:06,890
somehow with is there an understanding
 

841
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:08,380
somehow with is there an understanding
what kind of chemicals can control the

842
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:08,390
what kind of chemicals can control the
 

843
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:10,060
what kind of chemicals can control the
growth of a blood sure well now there is

844
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:10,070
growth of a blood sure well now there is
 

845
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,250
growth of a blood sure well now there is
but then when I started there wasn't and

846
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:12,260
but then when I started there wasn't and
 

847
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,140
but then when I started there wasn't and
that that gets to your original question

848
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:14,150
that that gets to your original question
 

849
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:16,360
that that gets to your original question
so you go through various steps we did

850
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:16,370
so you go through various steps we did
 

851
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:18,430
so you go through various steps we did
the first steps we showed that a such

852
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:18,440
the first steps we showed that a such
 

853
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,380
the first steps we showed that a such
molecules existed and then we developed

854
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:20,390
molecules existed and then we developed
 

855
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:22,840
molecules existed and then we developed
techniques for studying them and we said

856
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:22,850
techniques for studying them and we said
 

857
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:25,990
techniques for studying them and we said
even isolated fractions you know groups

858
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:26,000
even isolated fractions you know groups
 

859
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,690
even isolated fractions you know groups
of substances that would would do it but

860
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:28,700
of substances that would would do it but
 

861
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,840
of substances that would would do it but
what would happen over the next we did

862
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:31,850
what would happen over the next we did
 

863
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,120
what would happen over the next we did
that in 1976 we published that what

864
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:34,130
that in 1976 we published that what
 

865
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:35,500
that in 1976 we published that what
would happen over the next twenty eight

866
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:35,510
would happen over the next twenty eight
 

867
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:38,050
would happen over the next twenty eight
years as other people would follow in

868
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:38,060
years as other people would follow in
 

869
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,790
years as other people would follow in
our footsteps I mean we tried to do some

870
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:39,800
our footsteps I mean we tried to do some
 

871
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,610
our footsteps I mean we tried to do some
stuff too but ultimately to make a new

872
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:42,620
stuff too but ultimately to make a new
 

873
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:45,190
stuff too but ultimately to make a new
drug takes billions of dollars so what

874
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:45,200
drug takes billions of dollars so what
 

875
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,010
drug takes billions of dollars so what
happened was there were different growth

876
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:48,020
happened was there were different growth
 

877
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,470
happened was there were different growth
factors that people would isolate

878
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:49,480
factors that people would isolate
 

879
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,640
factors that people would isolate
sometimes using the techniques that we

880
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:51,650
sometimes using the techniques that we
 

881
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:55,720
sometimes using the techniques that we
developed and then they would figure out

882
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:55,730
developed and then they would figure out
 

883
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:57,610
developed and then they would figure out
using some of those techniques ways to

884
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:57,620
using some of those techniques ways to
 

885
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:00,100
using some of those techniques ways to
stop those growth factors and ways to

886
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:00,110
stop those growth factors and ways to
 

887
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:01,660
stop those growth factors and ways to
stop the blood vessels from growing I

888
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:01,670
stop the blood vessels from growing I
 

889
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:03,940
stop the blood vessels from growing I
thought like you say it took 28 years it

890
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:03,950
thought like you say it took 28 years it
 

891
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,620
thought like you say it took 28 years it
took billions of dollars and work by

892
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:05,630
took billions of dollars and work by
 

893
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:09,760
took billions of dollars and work by
many companies like Genentech but in

894
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:09,770
many companies like Genentech but in
 

895
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:13,690
many companies like Genentech but in
2004 28 years after we started the first

896
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:13,700
2004 28 years after we started the first
 

897
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,120
2004 28 years after we started the first
one of those Avastin got approved by the

898
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:16,130
one of those Avastin got approved by the
 

899
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:20,260
one of those Avastin got approved by the
fda and that that be that's become you

900
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:20,270
fda and that that be that's become you
 

901
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:22,330
fda and that that be that's become you
know one of the top biotech selling

902
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:22,340
know one of the top biotech selling
 

903
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,010
know one of the top biotech selling
drugs in history and it's been approved

904
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:24,020
drugs in history and it's been approved
 

905
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,810
drugs in history and it's been approved
for all kinds of cancers and actually

906
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:25,820
for all kinds of cancers and actually
 

907
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:28,090
for all kinds of cancers and actually
for many eye diseases to where you have

908
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:28,100
for many eye diseases to where you have
 

909
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:31,510
for many eye diseases to where you have
abnormal blood vessel growth macula so

910
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:31,520
abnormal blood vessel growth macula so
 

911
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,770
abnormal blood vessel growth macula so
in general one of the key ways you can

912
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:34,780
in general one of the key ways you can
 

913
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,669
in general one of the key ways you can
alleviate

914
00:18:36,669 --> 00:18:36,679
alleviate
 

915
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:40,460
alleviate
so what's the hope in terms of tumors

916
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:40,470
so what's the hope in terms of tumors
 

917
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:43,690
so what's the hope in terms of tumors
associated with cancerous tumors they

918
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:43,700
associated with cancerous tumors they
 

919
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,310
associated with cancerous tumors they
what can you help by being able to

920
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:46,320
what can you help by being able to
 

921
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,889
what can you help by being able to
control the growth of vessels so if you

922
00:18:48,889 --> 00:18:48,899
control the growth of vessels so if you
 

923
00:18:48,899 --> 00:18:51,789
control the growth of vessels so if you
cut off the blood supply you cut off the

924
00:18:51,789 --> 00:18:51,799
cut off the blood supply you cut off the
 

925
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:54,259
cut off the blood supply you cut off the
it's kind of like a war almost right you

926
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:54,269
it's kind of like a war almost right you
 

927
00:18:54,269 --> 00:18:56,869
it's kind of like a war almost right you
if you have if the nutrition is going to

928
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:56,879
if you have if the nutrition is going to
 

929
00:18:56,879 --> 00:18:59,479
if you have if the nutrition is going to
the tumor and you and you and you can

930
00:18:59,479 --> 00:18:59,489
the tumor and you and you and you can
 

931
00:18:59,489 --> 00:19:01,909
the tumor and you and you and you can
cut it off I mean you starve the tumor

932
00:19:01,909 --> 00:19:01,919
cut it off I mean you starve the tumor
 

933
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,859
cut it off I mean you starve the tumor
and it becomes very small it may

934
00:19:03,859 --> 00:19:03,869
and it becomes very small it may
 

935
00:19:03,869 --> 00:19:05,869
and it becomes very small it may
disappear or it's going to be much more

936
00:19:05,869 --> 00:19:05,879
disappear or it's going to be much more
 

937
00:19:05,879 --> 00:19:08,089
disappear or it's going to be much more
amenable to other therapies because it

938
00:19:08,089 --> 00:19:08,099
amenable to other therapies because it
 

939
00:19:08,099 --> 00:19:10,549
amenable to other therapies because it
is tiny you know like you know

940
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:10,559
is tiny you know like you know
 

941
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,619
is tiny you know like you know
chemotherapy or immunotherapy is gonna

942
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:12,629
chemotherapy or immunotherapy is gonna
 

943
00:19:12,629 --> 00:19:14,810
chemotherapy or immunotherapy is gonna
be have a much easier time against a

944
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:14,820
be have a much easier time against a
 

945
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,879
be have a much easier time against a
small tumor than a big one is that an

946
00:19:16,879 --> 00:19:16,889
small tumor than a big one is that an
 

947
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:20,450
small tumor than a big one is that an
obvious idea I mean it seems like a very

948
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:20,460
obvious idea I mean it seems like a very
 

949
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:23,389
obvious idea I mean it seems like a very
clever strategy in this war against yeah

950
00:19:23,389 --> 00:19:23,399
clever strategy in this war against yeah
 

951
00:19:23,399 --> 00:19:26,359
clever strategy in this war against yeah
cancer well you know in retrospect it's

952
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:26,369
cancer well you know in retrospect it's
 

953
00:19:26,369 --> 00:19:28,339
cancer well you know in retrospect it's
an obvious idea but when dr. Folkman and

954
00:19:28,339 --> 00:19:28,349
an obvious idea but when dr. Folkman and
 

955
00:19:28,349 --> 00:19:31,399
an obvious idea but when dr. Folkman and
my boss first proposed it it wasn't a

956
00:19:31,399 --> 00:19:31,409
my boss first proposed it it wasn't a
 

957
00:19:31,409 --> 00:19:32,960
my boss first proposed it it wasn't a
lot of people didn't thought it was

958
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:32,970
lot of people didn't thought it was
 

959
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:36,139
lot of people didn't thought it was
pretty crazy and so they in what sense

960
00:19:36,139 --> 00:19:36,149
pretty crazy and so they in what sense
 

961
00:19:36,149 --> 00:19:39,320
pretty crazy and so they in what sense
if you could sort of linger on it when

962
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:39,330
if you could sort of linger on it when
 

963
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:40,909
if you could sort of linger on it when
you're thinking about this ideas at the

964
00:19:40,909 --> 00:19:40,919
you're thinking about this ideas at the
 

965
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:43,219
you're thinking about this ideas at the
time were you feeling you're out in the

966
00:19:43,219 --> 00:19:43,229
time were you feeling you're out in the
 

967
00:19:43,229 --> 00:19:46,190
time were you feeling you're out in the
dark so how much mystery is there about

968
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:46,200
dark so how much mystery is there about
 

969
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,349
dark so how much mystery is there about
the whole thing how much just blind

970
00:19:48,349 --> 00:19:48,359
the whole thing how much just blind
 

971
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:50,930
the whole thing how much just blind
experimentation if you can put yourself

972
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:50,940
experimentation if you can put yourself
 

973
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,149
experimentation if you can put yourself
in that mindset from years ago yeah well

974
00:19:53,149 --> 00:19:53,159
in that mindset from years ago yeah well
 

975
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:56,029
in that mindset from years ago yeah well
there was I mean for me actually it

976
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:56,039
there was I mean for me actually it
 

977
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:57,830
there was I mean for me actually it
wasn't just the idea was that I didn't

978
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:57,840
wasn't just the idea was that I didn't
 

979
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,690
wasn't just the idea was that I didn't
know a lot of biology or biochemistry so

980
00:19:59,690 --> 00:19:59,700
know a lot of biology or biochemistry so
 

981
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,279
know a lot of biology or biochemistry so
I've certainly felt a host in the dark

982
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:01,289
I've certainly felt a host in the dark
 

983
00:20:01,289 --> 00:20:04,249
I've certainly felt a host in the dark
but I I kept trying and I kept trying to

984
00:20:04,249 --> 00:20:04,259
but I I kept trying and I kept trying to
 

985
00:20:04,259 --> 00:20:07,219
but I I kept trying and I kept trying to
learn and I kept plugging but but I mean

986
00:20:07,219 --> 00:20:07,229
learn and I kept plugging but but I mean
 

987
00:20:07,229 --> 00:20:09,619
learn and I kept plugging but but I mean
a lot of it was being in the dark so the

988
00:20:09,619 --> 00:20:09,629
a lot of it was being in the dark so the
 

989
00:20:09,629 --> 00:20:11,570
a lot of it was being in the dark so the
human body is complicated right we'll

990
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:11,580
human body is complicated right we'll
 

991
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:14,779
human body is complicated right we'll
establish this quantum mechanics and

992
00:20:14,779 --> 00:20:14,789
establish this quantum mechanics and
 

993
00:20:14,789 --> 00:20:16,099
establish this quantum mechanics and
physics is a theory that works

994
00:20:16,099 --> 00:20:16,109
physics is a theory that works
 

995
00:20:16,109 --> 00:20:17,599
physics is a theory that works
incredibly well but we don't really

996
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:17,609
incredibly well but we don't really
 

997
00:20:17,609 --> 00:20:19,460
incredibly well but we don't really
necessarily understand the underlying

998
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:19,470
necessarily understand the underlying
 

999
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:20,389
necessarily understand the underlying
nature of it

1000
00:20:20,389 --> 00:20:20,399
nature of it
 

1001
00:20:20,399 --> 00:20:23,509
nature of it
so our drugs the same and that you can

1002
00:20:23,509 --> 00:20:23,519
so our drugs the same and that you can
 

1003
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:26,440
so our drugs the same and that you can
you're ultimately trying to show that

1004
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:26,450
you're ultimately trying to show that
 

1005
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:29,299
you're ultimately trying to show that
the thing works to do something that you

1006
00:20:29,299 --> 00:20:29,309
the thing works to do something that you
 

1007
00:20:29,309 --> 00:20:30,680
the thing works to do something that you
try to do but you don't necessarily

1008
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:30,690
try to do but you don't necessarily
 

1009
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:34,339
try to do but you don't necessarily
understand the fundamental mechanisms by

1010
00:20:34,339 --> 00:20:34,349
understand the fundamental mechanisms by
 

1011
00:20:34,349 --> 00:20:36,919
understand the fundamental mechanisms by
which it's doing it it really varies I

1012
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:36,929
which it's doing it it really varies I
 

1013
00:20:36,929 --> 00:20:38,509
which it's doing it it really varies I
think sometimes people do know them

1014
00:20:38,509 --> 00:20:38,519
think sometimes people do know them
 

1015
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:41,029
think sometimes people do know them
because they've figured out pathways and

1016
00:20:41,029 --> 00:20:41,039
because they've figured out pathways and
 

1017
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,369
because they've figured out pathways and
wish to interfere them with them other

1018
00:20:43,369 --> 00:20:43,379
wish to interfere them with them other
 

1019
00:20:43,379 --> 00:20:45,469
wish to interfere them with them other
times is shooting in the dark is it

1020
00:20:45,469 --> 00:20:45,479
times is shooting in the dark is it
 

1021
00:20:45,479 --> 00:20:47,270
times is shooting in the dark is it
really has varied okay

1022
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:47,280
really has varied okay
 

1023
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,560
really has varied okay
and sometimes people make sure--and

1024
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:48,570
and sometimes people make sure--and
 

1025
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:50,690
and sometimes people make sure--and
Jupitus discoveries and they don't even

1026
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:50,700
Jupitus discoveries and they don't even
 

1027
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,950
Jupitus discoveries and they don't even
realize what they did so what is the

1028
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:53,960
realize what they did so what is the
 

1029
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,170
realize what they did so what is the
discovery process for a drug ze said a

1030
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:57,180
discovery process for a drug ze said a
 

1031
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,880
discovery process for a drug ze said a
bunch of people of trying to work with

1032
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:58,890
bunch of people of trying to work with
 

1033
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:04,270
bunch of people of trying to work with
this is it is it a kind of mix of

1034
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:04,280
this is it is it a kind of mix of
 

1035
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:08,690
this is it is it a kind of mix of
serendipitous discovery and art or is

1036
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:08,700
serendipitous discovery and art or is
 

1037
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,730
serendipitous discovery and art or is
there a systematic science to trying

1038
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:10,740
there a systematic science to trying
 

1039
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:13,610
there a systematic science to trying
different chemical reactions and how

1040
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:13,620
different chemical reactions and how
 

1041
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,640
different chemical reactions and how
they how they affect whatever you trying

1042
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:16,650
they how they affect whatever you trying
 

1043
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:19,070
they how they affect whatever you trying
to do like shrink blood vessels yeah I

1044
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:19,080
to do like shrink blood vessels yeah I
 

1045
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,870
to do like shrink blood vessels yeah I
don't think there's a single way you

1046
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:20,880
don't think there's a single way you
 

1047
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,090
don't think there's a single way you
know single way to go about something in

1048
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:23,100
know single way to go about something in
 

1049
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,280
know single way to go about something in
terms of characterizing the entire drug

1050
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:25,290
terms of characterizing the entire drug
 

1051
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:27,290
terms of characterizing the entire drug
discovery process if I look at the blood

1052
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:27,300
discovery process if I look at the blood
 

1053
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:30,140
discovery process if I look at the blood
vessel one yeah they're the first step

1054
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:30,150
vessel one yeah they're the first step
 

1055
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:34,010
vessel one yeah they're the first step
was to do to have that those kinds of

1056
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:34,020
was to do to have that those kinds of
 

1057
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,840
was to do to have that those kinds of
theories that dr. Folkman had the second

1058
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:35,850
theories that dr. Folkman had the second
 

1059
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:37,700
theories that dr. Folkman had the second
step was to have the techniques where

1060
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:37,710
step was to have the techniques where
 

1061
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:39,350
step was to have the techniques where
you could study blood vessel growth for

1062
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:39,360
you could study blood vessel growth for
 

1063
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,390
you could study blood vessel growth for
the first time and at least quantitate

1064
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:41,400
the first time and at least quantitate
 

1065
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,560
the first time and at least quantitate
or semi-quantitative

1066
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:42,570
or semi-quantitative
 

1067
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:46,850
or semi-quantitative
a third step was to find substances that

1068
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:46,860
a third step was to find substances that
 

1069
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,940
a third step was to find substances that
would stop blood vessels from growing

1070
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:48,950
would stop blood vessels from growing
 

1071
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:51,380
would stop blood vessels from growing
for step was to maybe purify those

1072
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:51,390
for step was to maybe purify those
 

1073
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:55,310
for step was to maybe purify those
substances there are many other steps

1074
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:55,320
substances there are many other steps
 

1075
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,410
substances there are many other steps
too I mean before you have an effective

1076
00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:57,420
too I mean before you have an effective
 

1077
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,880
too I mean before you have an effective
drug you have to show that it's safe you

1078
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:58,890
drug you have to show that it's safe you
 

1079
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:00,890
drug you have to show that it's safe you
have to show those effective and you

1080
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:00,900
have to show those effective and you
 

1081
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,720
have to show those effective and you
start with animals you ultimately go to

1082
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:02,730
start with animals you ultimately go to
 

1083
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:04,550
start with animals you ultimately go to
patients and there are multiple kinds of

1084
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:04,560
patients and there are multiple kinds of
 

1085
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,650
patients and there are multiple kinds of
clinical trials you have to do if you

1086
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:06,660
clinical trials you have to do if you
 

1087
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:09,770
clinical trials you have to do if you
step back is it amazing to you that we

1088
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:09,780
step back is it amazing to you that we
 

1089
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:12,050
step back is it amazing to you that we
descendants of great apes are able to

1090
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:12,060
descendants of great apes are able to
 

1091
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:15,590
descendants of great apes are able to
create things there you know are the

1092
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:15,600
create things there you know are the
 

1093
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,610
create things there you know are the
create drugs chemicals that are able to

1094
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:18,620
create drugs chemicals that are able to
 

1095
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:21,620
create drugs chemicals that are able to
improve some aspects of our bodies Hey

1096
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:21,630
improve some aspects of our bodies Hey
 

1097
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:25,340
improve some aspects of our bodies Hey
or is it quite natural that we were able

1098
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:25,350
or is it quite natural that we were able
 

1099
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:27,860
or is it quite natural that we were able
to discover these kinds of things well

1100
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:27,870
to discover these kinds of things well
 

1101
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:28,670
to discover these kinds of things well
at a high level

1102
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:28,680
at a high level
 

1103
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,560
at a high level
it is amazing I mean evolution is

1104
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:30,570
it is amazing I mean evolution is
 

1105
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:32,330
it is amazing I mean evolution is
amazing yeah you know the way I look at

1106
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:32,340
amazing yeah you know the way I look at
 

1107
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,640
amazing yeah you know the way I look at
your question the fact that we evolved

1108
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:34,650
your question the fact that we evolved
 

1109
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:36,650
your question the fact that we evolved
have evolved the way we've done I mean

1110
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:36,660
have evolved the way we've done I mean
 

1111
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:39,050
have evolved the way we've done I mean
it's pretty remarkable so let's talk

1112
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:39,060
it's pretty remarkable so let's talk
 

1113
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:41,990
it's pretty remarkable so let's talk
about drug delivery what are the

1114
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:42,000
about drug delivery what are the
 

1115
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,820
about drug delivery what are the
difficult problems in drug delivery what

1116
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:43,830
difficult problems in drug delivery what
 

1117
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:48,200
difficult problems in drug delivery what
is drug delivery you know from starting

1118
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:48,210
is drug delivery you know from starting
 

1119
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:49,820
is drug delivery you know from starting
from your early seminal work in the

1120
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:49,830
from your early seminal work in the
 

1121
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:53,230
from your early seminal work in the
field that today well drug delivery is

1122
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:53,240
field that today well drug delivery is
 

1123
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:56,330
field that today well drug delivery is
getting a drug to to be good to go where

1124
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:56,340
getting a drug to to be good to go where
 

1125
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,100
getting a drug to to be good to go where
you want it at the level you want it in

1126
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:58,110
you want it at the level you want it in
 

1127
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:58,940
you want it at the level you want it in
a safe way

1128
00:22:58,940 --> 00:22:58,950
a safe way
 

1129
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:00,920
a safe way
some of the big challenges

1130
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:00,930
some of the big challenges
 

1131
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:02,450
some of the big challenges
I mean there are a lot I mean I'd say

1132
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:02,460
I mean there are a lot I mean I'd say
 

1133
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:06,440
I mean there are a lot I mean I'd say
one is could you target the right cell

1134
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:06,450
one is could you target the right cell
 

1135
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:08,210
one is could you target the right cell
like we talked about cancers or some way

1136
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:08,220
like we talked about cancers or some way
 

1137
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,280
like we talked about cancers or some way
to deliver a drug just to the cancer

1138
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:10,290
to deliver a drug just to the cancer
 

1139
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:12,770
to deliver a drug just to the cancer
cell and no other cell another challenge

1140
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:12,780
cell and no other cell another challenge
 

1141
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:15,290
cell and no other cell another challenge
is to get drugs across different

1142
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:15,300
is to get drugs across different
 

1143
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,670
is to get drugs across different
barriers like could you ever give

1144
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:16,680
barriers like could you ever give
 

1145
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:19,070
barriers like could you ever give
insulin orally could you give a train

1146
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:19,080
insulin orally could you give a train
 

1147
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,420
insulin orally could you give a train
you know or give it passively

1148
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:20,430
you know or give it passively
 

1149
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:22,820
you know or give it passively
transdermally can you get drugs across

1150
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:22,830
transdermally can you get drugs across
 

1151
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,500
transdermally can you get drugs across
the blood-brain barrier I mean there are

1152
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:24,510
the blood-brain barrier I mean there are
 

1153
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:26,750
the blood-brain barrier I mean there are
lots of big challenges can you make

1154
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:26,760
lots of big challenges can you make
 

1155
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,330
lots of big challenges can you make
smart drug delivery systems that might

1156
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:29,340
smart drug delivery systems that might
 

1157
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,790
smart drug delivery systems that might
respond to physiologic signals in the

1158
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:31,800
respond to physiologic signals in the
 

1159
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,330
respond to physiologic signals in the
body oh it's just think so smart

1160
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:34,340
body oh it's just think so smart
 

1161
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:37,190
body oh it's just think so smart
smart they have some kind of sense a

1162
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:37,200
smart they have some kind of sense a
 

1163
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,990
smart they have some kind of sense a
chemical sensor or is this something

1164
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:39,000
chemical sensor or is this something
 

1165
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,370
chemical sensor or is this something
more than a chemical sense that it's

1166
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:40,380
more than a chemical sense that it's
 

1167
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,310
more than a chemical sense that it's
able to respond to something in the body

1168
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:42,320
able to respond to something in the body
 

1169
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,020
able to respond to something in the body
could be either one I mean you know I I

1170
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:45,030
could be either one I mean you know I I
 

1171
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:47,780
could be either one I mean you know I I
mean one example might be if you that

1172
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:47,790
mean one example might be if you that
 

1173
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:51,620
mean one example might be if you that
were diabetic if you had more it got

1174
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:51,630
were diabetic if you had more it got
 

1175
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:53,240
were diabetic if you had more it got
more glucose could you get more insulin

1176
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:53,250
more glucose could you get more insulin
 

1177
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:55,640
more glucose could you get more insulin
but I don't but that but that's just an

1178
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:55,650
but I don't but that but that's just an
 

1179
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:58,550
but I don't but that but that's just an
example is there some way to control the

1180
00:23:58,550 --> 00:23:58,560
example is there some way to control the
 

1181
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,440
example is there some way to control the
actual mechanism of delivery in a

1182
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:00,450
actual mechanism of delivery in a
 

1183
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:02,570
actual mechanism of delivery in a
response to what the body's doing yes

1184
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:02,580
response to what the body's doing yes
 

1185
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,460
response to what the body's doing yes
there is I mean one of the things that

1186
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:04,470
there is I mean one of the things that
 

1187
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:06,680
there is I mean one of the things that
we've done is encapsulate what are

1188
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:06,690
we've done is encapsulate what are
 

1189
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:08,210
we've done is encapsulate what are
called beta cells those are insulin

1190
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:08,220
called beta cells those are insulin
 

1191
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:10,160
called beta cells those are insulin
producing cells in a way that they're

1192
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:10,170
producing cells in a way that they're
 

1193
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:13,520
producing cells in a way that they're
safe and protected and then what will

1194
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:13,530
safe and protected and then what will
 

1195
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:17,660
safe and protected and then what will
happen is glucose will go in and you

1196
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:17,670
happen is glucose will go in and you
 

1197
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:19,940
happen is glucose will go in and you
know to sell so we'll make insulin and

1198
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:19,950
know to sell so we'll make insulin and
 

1199
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:22,150
know to sell so we'll make insulin and
so that that's an example

1200
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:22,160
so that that's an example
 

1201
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:26,000
so that that's an example
so from an AI robotics perspective how

1202
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:26,010
so from an AI robotics perspective how
 

1203
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:29,360
so from an AI robotics perspective how
close are these drug delivery systems to

1204
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:29,370
close are these drug delivery systems to
 

1205
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:31,310
close are these drug delivery systems to
something like a robot or they're

1206
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:31,320
something like a robot or they're
 

1207
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,340
something like a robot or they're
totally wrong to think about them as

1208
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:33,350
totally wrong to think about them as
 

1209
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:36,830
totally wrong to think about them as
intelligent agents and how much room is

1210
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:36,840
intelligent agents and how much room is
 

1211
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,440
intelligent agents and how much room is
there to add that kind of intelligence

1212
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:39,450
there to add that kind of intelligence
 

1213
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:41,540
there to add that kind of intelligence
into these delivery systems perhaps in

1214
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:41,550
into these delivery systems perhaps in
 

1215
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:43,220
into these delivery systems perhaps in
the future yeah I think it depends on

1216
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:43,230
the future yeah I think it depends on
 

1217
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:45,260
the future yeah I think it depends on
the particular delivery system you know

1218
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:45,270
the particular delivery system you know
 

1219
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:46,400
the particular delivery system you know
of course one of the things people are

1220
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:46,410
of course one of the things people are
 

1221
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:48,410
of course one of the things people are
concerned about is cost and if you add a

1222
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:48,420
concerned about is cost and if you add a
 

1223
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,030
concerned about is cost and if you add a
lot of bells and whistles to something

1224
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:50,040
lot of bells and whistles to something
 

1225
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,280
lot of bells and whistles to something
it'll cost more but I mean we for

1226
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:52,290
it'll cost more but I mean we for
 

1227
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:54,590
it'll cost more but I mean we for
example have made what I'll call

1228
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:54,600
example have made what I'll call
 

1229
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,200
example have made what I'll call
intelligent microchips that can don't

1230
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:57,210
intelligent microchips that can don't
 

1231
00:24:57,210 --> 00:24:58,940
intelligent microchips that can don't
you know where you can send a signal and

1232
00:24:58,940 --> 00:24:58,950
you know where you can send a signal and
 

1233
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:00,860
you know where you can send a signal and
you know release drug in response to

1234
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:00,870
you know release drug in response to
 

1235
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:02,990
you know release drug in response to
that say no and I think systems like

1236
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:03,000
that say no and I think systems like
 

1237
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,850
that say no and I think systems like
that microchip someday have the

1238
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:04,860
that microchip someday have the
 

1239
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,260
that microchip someday have the
potential to do it you and I were just

1240
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:06,270
potential to do it you and I were just
 

1241
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:08,330
potential to do it you and I were just
talking about that there could be a

1242
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:08,340
talking about that there could be a
 

1243
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,370
talking about that there could be a
signal like glucose and it could have

1244
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:10,380
signal like glucose and it could have
 

1245
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,930
signal like glucose and it could have
some instruction to say when there's

1246
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:11,940
some instruction to say when there's
 

1247
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,940
some instruction to say when there's
more glucose deliver more insulin

1248
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:13,950
more glucose deliver more insulin
 

1249
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:15,830
more glucose deliver more insulin
so do you think it's possible that there

1250
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:15,840
so do you think it's possible that there
 

1251
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,409
so do you think it's possible that there
that could be robotic type systems

1252
00:25:18,409 --> 00:25:18,419
that could be robotic type systems
 

1253
00:25:18,419 --> 00:25:20,810
that could be robotic type systems
roaming our body sort of long-term and

1254
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:20,820
roaming our body sort of long-term and
 

1255
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,220
roaming our body sort of long-term and
be able to deliver certain kinds of

1256
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:22,230
be able to deliver certain kinds of
 

1257
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:25,340
be able to deliver certain kinds of
drugs in the future you see you see that

1258
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:25,350
drugs in the future you see you see that
 

1259
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:27,830
drugs in the future you see you see that
kind of future someday I don't think

1260
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:27,840
kind of future someday I don't think
 

1261
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,360
kind of future someday I don't think
we're very close to it yet but someday

1262
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:29,370
we're very close to it yet but someday
 

1263
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:31,970
we're very close to it yet but someday
you know that that's nanotechnology and

1264
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:31,980
you know that that's nanotechnology and
 

1265
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,919
you know that that's nanotechnology and
that would mean even miniaturizing some

1266
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:33,929
that would mean even miniaturizing some
 

1267
00:25:33,929 --> 00:25:35,840
that would mean even miniaturizing some
of the things that I just discussed and

1268
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:35,850
of the things that I just discussed and
 

1269
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:37,580
of the things that I just discussed and
we're certainly not at that point yet

1270
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:37,590
we're certainly not at that point yet
 

1271
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:40,490
we're certainly not at that point yet
but someday I expect we will be so some

1272
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:40,500
but someday I expect we will be so some
 

1273
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,279
but someday I expect we will be so some
of it is just the shrinking of the

1274
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:43,289
of it is just the shrinking of the
 

1275
00:25:43,289 --> 00:25:45,169
of it is just the shrinking of the
technology that's a part of it that's

1276
00:25:45,169 --> 00:25:45,179
technology that's a part of it that's
 

1277
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:48,620
technology that's a part of it that's
one of the things in general what role

1278
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:48,630
one of the things in general what role
 

1279
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:52,460
one of the things in general what role
do you see AI sort of there there's a

1280
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:52,470
do you see AI sort of there there's a
 

1281
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:55,519
do you see AI sort of there there's a
lot of work now with using data to make

1282
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:55,529
lot of work now with using data to make
 

1283
00:25:55,529 --> 00:25:57,440
lot of work now with using data to make
intelligent and create systems that make

1284
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:57,450
intelligent and create systems that make
 

1285
00:25:57,450 --> 00:26:01,580
intelligent and create systems that make
intelligent decisions do you see any of

1286
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:01,590
intelligent decisions do you see any of
 

1287
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:05,240
intelligent decisions do you see any of
that data-driven kind of computing

1288
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:05,250
that data-driven kind of computing
 

1289
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:09,139
that data-driven kind of computing
systems having a role in any part of

1290
00:26:09,139 --> 00:26:09,149
systems having a role in any part of

00:26:09,149 --> 00:26:12,320
systems having a role in any part of
this into the delivery and drugs the the

00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:12,330
this into the delivery and drugs the the
 

1293
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:14,480
this into the delivery and drugs the the
design of drugs and any part of the

1294
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:14,490
design of drugs and any part of the
 

1295
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:17,899
design of drugs and any part of the
chain I do I think that AI can be useful

1296
00:26:17,899 --> 00:26:17,909
chain I do I think that AI can be useful
 

1297
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,909
chain I do I think that AI can be useful
and a number of parts of the chain I

1298
00:26:19,909 --> 00:26:19,919
and a number of parts of the chain I
 

1299
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,460
and a number of parts of the chain I
mean one I think if you get a large

1300
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:22,470
mean one I think if you get a large
 

1301
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:24,350
mean one I think if you get a large
amount of information you know say you

1302
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:24,360
amount of information you know say you
 

1303
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,570
amount of information you know say you
have some chemical data because you've

1304
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:26,580
have some chemical data because you've
 

1305
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:29,330
have some chemical data because you've
done high throughput screens and let's

1306
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:29,340
done high throughput screens and let's
 

1307
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:31,039
done high throughput screens and let's
out I'll just make this up but let's say

1308
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:31,049
out I'll just make this up but let's say
 

1309
00:26:31,049 --> 00:26:33,409
out I'll just make this up but let's say
I have I'm trying to come up with a drug

1310
00:26:33,409 --> 00:26:33,419
I have I'm trying to come up with a drug
 

1311
00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:36,649
I have I'm trying to come up with a drug
to treat disease X and whatever that

1312
00:26:36,649 --> 00:26:36,659
to treat disease X and whatever that
 

1313
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:39,710
to treat disease X and whatever that
disease is and I have a test for that

1314
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:39,720
disease is and I have a test for that
 

1315
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:43,940
disease is and I have a test for that
and hopefully a fast test and let's say

1316
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:43,950
and hopefully a fast test and let's say
 

1317
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:46,759
and hopefully a fast test and let's say
I test ten thousand chemical substances

1318
00:26:46,759 --> 00:26:46,769
I test ten thousand chemical substances
 

1319
00:26:46,769 --> 00:26:49,399
I test ten thousand chemical substances
you know and a couple work most of them

1320
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:49,409
you know and a couple work most of them
 

1321
00:26:49,409 --> 00:26:51,529
you know and a couple work most of them
don't work so I maybe work a little but

1322
00:26:51,529 --> 00:26:51,539
don't work so I maybe work a little but
 

1323
00:26:51,539 --> 00:26:53,389
don't work so I maybe work a little but
if I had a few with the right kind of

1324
00:26:53,389 --> 00:26:53,399
if I had a few with the right kind of
 

1325
00:26:53,399 --> 00:26:55,460
if I had a few with the right kind of
artificial intelligence maybe you could

1326
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:55,470
artificial intelligence maybe you could
 

1327
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:57,529
artificial intelligence maybe you could
look at the chemical structures and look

1328
00:26:57,529 --> 00:26:57,539
look at the chemical structures and look
 

1329
00:26:57,539 --> 00:26:58,850
look at the chemical structures and look
at what works and see if there's certain

1330
00:26:58,850 --> 00:26:58,860
at what works and see if there's certain
 

1331
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,620
at what works and see if there's certain
commonalities look at what doesn't work

1332
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:00,630
commonalities look at what doesn't work
 

1333
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:02,990
commonalities look at what doesn't work
and see what commonalities there are and

1334
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:03,000
and see what commonalities there are and
 

1335
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,720
and see what commonalities there are and
then maybe use that somehow to project

1336
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:05,730
then maybe use that somehow to project
 

1337
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:07,220
then maybe use that somehow to project
the next generation of things that you

1338
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:07,230
the next generation of things that you
 

1339
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:10,009
the next generation of things that you
would test as a tangent what are your

1340
00:27:10,009 --> 00:27:10,019
would test as a tangent what are your
 

1341
00:27:10,019 --> 00:27:12,740
would test as a tangent what are your
thoughts on our society's relationship

1342
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:12,750
thoughts on our society's relationship
 

1343
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:15,680
thoughts on our society's relationship
with pharmaceutical drugs do we and

1344
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:15,690
with pharmaceutical drugs do we and
 

1345
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:17,810
with pharmaceutical drugs do we and
perhaps I apologize if this is a

1346
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:17,820
perhaps I apologize if this is a
 

1347
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:20,899
perhaps I apologize if this is a
philosophical broader question but do we

1348
00:27:20,899 --> 00:27:20,909
philosophical broader question but do we
 

1349
00:27:20,909 --> 00:27:22,850
philosophical broader question but do we
over rely on them do we properly

1350
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:22,860
over rely on them do we properly
 

1351
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:25,789
over rely on them do we properly
prescribed them and what ways the system

1352
00:27:25,789 --> 00:27:25,799
prescribed them and what ways the system
 

1353
00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:28,240
prescribed them and what ways the system
working well what way can improve

1354
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:28,250
working well what way can improve
 

1355
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:31,760
working well what way can improve
well I think you know pharmaceutical

1356
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:31,770
well I think you know pharmaceutical
 

1357
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:34,279
well I think you know pharmaceutical
drugs are really important I mean the

1358
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:34,289
drugs are really important I mean the
 

1359
00:27:34,289 --> 00:27:36,529
drugs are really important I mean the
life expectancy and life quality of

1360
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:36,539
life expectancy and life quality of
 

1361
00:27:36,539 --> 00:27:39,350
life expectancy and life quality of
people over many many years has

1362
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:39,360
people over many many years has
 

1363
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,450
people over many many years has
increased tremendously and I think

1364
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:41,460
increased tremendously and I think
 

1365
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,370
increased tremendously and I think
that's a really good thing I think one

1366
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:43,380
that's a really good thing I think one
 

1367
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,169
that's a really good thing I think one
thing that would also be good as if we

1368
00:27:45,169 --> 00:27:45,179
thing that would also be good as if we
 

1369
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:46,730
thing that would also be good as if we
could extend that more and more to

1370
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:46,740
could extend that more and more to
 

1371
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,710
could extend that more and more to
people in the developing world which is

1372
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:48,720
people in the developing world which is
 

1373
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,510
people in the developing world which is
something that our lab has been doing

1374
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:50,520
something that our lab has been doing
 

1375
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,490
something that our lab has been doing
with the Gates Foundation or trying to

1376
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:52,500
with the Gates Foundation or trying to
 

1377
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,940
with the Gates Foundation or trying to
do I saw I think ways in which it could

1378
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:55,950
do I saw I think ways in which it could
 

1379
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:58,580
do I saw I think ways in which it could
improve I mean our if there was some way

1380
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:58,590
improve I mean our if there was some way
 

1381
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:00,560
improve I mean our if there was some way
to reduce costs you know that that's

1382
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:00,570
to reduce costs you know that that's
 

1383
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:01,820
to reduce costs you know that that's
certainly an issue people are concerned

1384
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:01,830
certainly an issue people are concerned
 

1385
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:03,740
certainly an issue people are concerned
about if there was some way to help

1386
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:03,750
about if there was some way to help
 

1387
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:06,080
about if there was some way to help
people and in poor countries that would

1388
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:06,090
people and in poor countries that would
 

1389
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:07,820
people and in poor countries that would
also be a good thing and then of course

1390
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:07,830
also be a good thing and then of course
 

1391
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:11,299
also be a good thing and then of course
we still need to make better drugs for

1392
00:28:11,299 --> 00:28:11,309
we still need to make better drugs for
 

1393
00:28:11,309 --> 00:28:14,149
we still need to make better drugs for
so many diseases I mean cancer diabetes

1394
00:28:14,149 --> 00:28:14,159
so many diseases I mean cancer diabetes
 

1395
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,940
so many diseases I mean cancer diabetes
I mean we you know it's hard to see some

1396
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:16,950
I mean we you know it's hard to see some
 

1397
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:18,799
I mean we you know it's hard to see some
rare diseases there are many many

1398
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:18,809
rare diseases there are many many
 

1399
00:28:18,809 --> 00:28:21,049
rare diseases there are many many
situations where it would be great if we

1400
00:28:21,049 --> 00:28:21,059
situations where it would be great if we
 

1401
00:28:21,059 --> 00:28:23,570
situations where it would be great if we
could do better and help more people can

1402
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:23,580
could do better and help more people can
 

1403
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:26,750
could do better and help more people can
we talk about another exciting another

1404
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:26,760
we talk about another exciting another
 

1405
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,310
we talk about another exciting another
exciting space which is tissue

1406
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:28,320
exciting space which is tissue
 

1407
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,060
exciting space which is tissue
engineering

1408
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:29,070
engineering
 

1409
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:30,890
engineering
what is tissue engineering or

1410
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:30,900
what is tissue engineering or
 

1411
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:33,140
what is tissue engineering or
regenerative medicine you know so that

1412
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:33,150
regenerative medicine you know so that
 

1413
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:34,850
regenerative medicine you know so that
tissue engineering regenerative medicine

1414
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:34,860
tissue engineering regenerative medicine
 

1415
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:37,340
tissue engineering regenerative medicine
have to do with building an organ or

1416
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:37,350
have to do with building an organ or
 

1417
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:40,130
have to do with building an organ or
tissue from scratch so you know someday

1418
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:40,140
tissue from scratch so you know someday
 

1419
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,830
tissue from scratch so you know someday
maybe we can build the liver you know or

1420
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:42,840
maybe we can build the liver you know or
 

1421
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:47,000
maybe we can build the liver you know or
make new cartilage and also would enable

1422
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:47,010
make new cartilage and also would enable
 

1423
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:49,430
make new cartilage and also would enable
you to you know someday create organs on

1424
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:49,440
you to you know someday create organs on
 

1425
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,350
you to you know someday create organs on
a chip which people we and others are

1426
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:51,360
a chip which people we and others are
 

1427
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,570
a chip which people we and others are
trying to do which might lead to better

1428
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:53,580
trying to do which might lead to better
 

1429
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:56,570
trying to do which might lead to better
drug testing and maybe less testing on

1430
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:56,580
drug testing and maybe less testing on
 

1431
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:59,810
drug testing and maybe less testing on
animals for people organs and I chip it

1432
00:28:59,810 --> 00:28:59,820
animals for people organs and I chip it
 

1433
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:03,890
animals for people organs and I chip it
sounds fascinating so what what are the

1434
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:03,900
sounds fascinating so what what are the
 

1435
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,529
sounds fascinating so what what are the
various ways to generate tissue and how

1436
00:29:06,529 --> 00:29:06,539
various ways to generate tissue and how
 

1437
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:09,200
various ways to generate tissue and how
do so is it you know that one is of

1438
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:09,210
do so is it you know that one is of
 

1439
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:10,940
do so is it you know that one is of
course from stem cells is there are

1440
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:10,950
course from stem cells is there are
 

1441
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:12,919
course from stem cells is there are
other methods what are the different

1442
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:12,929
other methods what are the different
 

1443
00:29:12,929 --> 00:29:15,080
other methods what are the different
possible flavors here yeah well I think

1444
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:15,090
possible flavors here yeah well I think
 

1445
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:17,570
possible flavors here yeah well I think
I mean there's multiple components one

1446
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:17,580
I mean there's multiple components one
 

1447
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,100
I mean there's multiple components one
is having generally some type of

1448
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:19,110
is having generally some type of
 

1449
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:21,470
is having generally some type of
scaffold that's what Jay Vacanti and I

1450
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:21,480
scaffold that's what Jay Vacanti and I
 

1451
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:24,320
scaffold that's what Jay Vacanti and I
started many many years ago and then on

1452
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:24,330
started many many years ago and then on
 

1453
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:27,260
started many many years ago and then on
that scaffold you might put different

1454
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:27,270
that scaffold you might put different
 

1455
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:29,419
that scaffold you might put different
cell types which could be a cartilage

1456
00:29:29,419 --> 00:29:29,429
cell types which could be a cartilage
 

1457
00:29:29,429 --> 00:29:31,520
cell types which could be a cartilage
cell a bone cell could be a stem cell

1458
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:31,530
cell a bone cell could be a stem cell
 

1459
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:32,779
cell a bone cell could be a stem cell
though it might differentiate into

1460
00:29:32,779 --> 00:29:32,789
though it might differentiate into
 

1461
00:29:32,789 --> 00:29:34,580
though it might differentiate into
different things could be more than one

1462
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:34,590
different things could be more than one
 

1463
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:36,560
different things could be more than one
cell and the scaffold

1464
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:36,570
cell and the scaffold
 

1465
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:38,060
cell and the scaffold
sorry to interrupt is kind of like a

1466
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:38,070
sorry to interrupt is kind of like a
 

1467
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,889
sorry to interrupt is kind of like a
canvas that it's a structure that you

1468
00:29:39,889 --> 00:29:39,899
canvas that it's a structure that you
 

1469
00:29:39,899 --> 00:29:41,600
canvas that it's a structure that you
can on which the

1470
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:41,610
can on which the
 

1471
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:43,730
can on which the
the Susskind girl I think that's a good

1472
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:43,740
the Susskind girl I think that's a good
 

1473
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,410
the Susskind girl I think that's a good
explanation when you just enough to use

1474
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:45,420
explanation when you just enough to use
 

1475
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:47,630
explanation when you just enough to use
that the caskets that's good

1476
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:47,640
that the caskets that's good
 

1477
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,850
that the caskets that's good
yeah so I think that that's fair you

1478
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:49,860
yeah so I think that that's fair you
 

1479
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:50,930
yeah so I think that that's fair you
know when the chip could be such a

1480
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:50,940
know when the chip could be such a
 

1481
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:54,200
know when the chip could be such a
canvas some could be fibers that are

1482
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:54,210
canvas some could be fibers that are
 

1483
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:55,970
canvas some could be fibers that are
made of plastics and that you'd put in

1484
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:55,980
made of plastics and that you'd put in
 

1485
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:58,040
made of plastics and that you'd put in
the body someday and we need a chip do

1486
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:58,050
the body someday and we need a chip do
 

1487
00:29:58,050 --> 00:29:59,960
the body someday and we need a chip do
you mean electronic chip like

1488
00:29:59,960 --> 00:29:59,970
you mean electronic chip like
 

1489
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:02,480
you mean electronic chip like
necessarily it could be though but it

1490
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:02,490
necessarily it could be though but it
 

1491
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:03,800
necessarily it could be though but it
doesn't have to be it could just be a

1492
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:03,810
doesn't have to be it could just be a
 

1493
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:08,090
doesn't have to be it could just be a
structure that's not not in vivo so to

1494
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:08,100
structure that's not not in vivo so to
 

1495
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,590
structure that's not not in vivo so to
speak that's you know that's outside the

1496
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:09,600
speak that's you know that's outside the
 

1497
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,470
speak that's you know that's outside the
body so is there a nervousness it's not

1498
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:12,480
body so is there a nervousness it's not
 

1499
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:17,500
body so is there a nervousness it's not
a bad word says there possibility to

1500
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:17,510
a bad word says there possibility to
 

1501
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:20,090
a bad word says there possibility to
weave into the scanner as a

1502
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:20,100
weave into the scanner as a
 

1503
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,820
weave into the scanner as a
computational component so if we talk

1504
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:22,830
computational component so if we talk
 

1505
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:25,850
computational component so if we talk
about electron ships some some ability

1506
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:25,860
about electron ships some some ability
 

1507
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:28,940
about electron ships some some ability
to sense control some aspect of this

1508
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:28,950
to sense control some aspect of this
 

1509
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:31,820
to sense control some aspect of this
growth process for the tissue I would

1510
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:31,830
growth process for the tissue I would
 

1511
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,680
growth process for the tissue I would
say the answer to that is yes I think

1512
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:33,690
say the answer to that is yes I think
 

1513
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:37,390
say the answer to that is yes I think
right now people are working mostly on

1514
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:37,400
right now people are working mostly on
 

1515
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,580
right now people are working mostly on
validating these con chips for saying

1516
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:40,590
validating these con chips for saying
 

1517
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:43,570
validating these con chips for saying
well it does work as effectively or

1518
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:43,580
well it does work as effectively or
 

1519
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:46,430
well it does work as effectively or
hopefully as just putting something in

1520
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:46,440
hopefully as just putting something in
 

1521
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,410
hopefully as just putting something in
the body but I think someday will you

1522
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:48,420
the body but I think someday will you
 

1523
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:50,180
the body but I think someday will you
suggest it you certainly would be

1524
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:50,190
suggest it you certainly would be
 

1525
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:52,460
suggest it you certainly would be
possible so what kind of tissues can we

1526
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:52,470
possible so what kind of tissues can we
 

1527
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:54,920
possible so what kind of tissues can we
engineer today what would yeah yeah well

1528
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:54,930
engineer today what would yeah yeah well
 

1529
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:57,110
engineer today what would yeah yeah well
well so skin has already been made and

1530
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:57,120
well so skin has already been made and
 

1531
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,390
well so skin has already been made and
approved by the FDA their advanced

1532
00:30:59,390 --> 00:30:59,400
approved by the FDA their advanced
 

1533
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,490
approved by the FDA their advanced
clinical trials like what are called

1534
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:01,500
clinical trials like what are called
 

1535
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,280
clinical trials like what are called
phase three trials that are at complete

1536
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:04,290
phase three trials that are at complete
 

1537
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:07,340
phase three trials that are at complete
or near completion for making new blood

1538
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:07,350
or near completion for making new blood

Nicholson led a lot of that he thought

1542
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:13,320
Nicholson led a lot of that he thought
 

1543
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,440
Nicholson led a lot of that he thought
that's amazing this human skin can be

1544
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:15,450
that's amazing this human skin can be
 

1545
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:17,360
that's amazing this human skin can be
grown that's already approved through

1546
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:17,370
grown that's already approved through
 

1547
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:21,100
grown that's already approved through
the entire the FDA process so that means

1548
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:21,110
the entire the FDA process so that means
 

1549
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:26,200
the entire the FDA process so that means
what so the one that means you can grow

1550
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:26,210
what so the one that means you can grow
 

1551
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:29,270
what so the one that means you can grow
that tissue and do various kinds of

1552
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:29,280
that tissue and do various kinds of
 

1553
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:32,510
that tissue and do various kinds of
experiments in terms of in terms of

1554
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:32,520
experiments in terms of in terms of
 

1555
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,180
experiments in terms of in terms of
drugs and so on but what is that does

1556
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:35,190
drugs and so on but what is that does
 

1557
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:37,310
drugs and so on but what is that does
that mean that some kind of healing and

1558
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:37,320
that mean that some kind of healing and
 

1559
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:40,220
that mean that some kind of healing and
treatment of different conditions for on

1560
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:40,230
treatment of different conditions for on
 

1561
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:42,260
treatment of different conditions for on
human beings yes I mean they've been

1562
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:42,270
human beings yes I mean they've been
 

1563
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:43,970
human beings yes I mean they've been
approved now for how many different

1564
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:43,980
approved now for how many different
 

1565
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,350
approved now for how many different
groups have made them different

1566
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:45,360
groups have made them different
 

1567
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,750
groups have made them different
companies and different professors but

1568
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:47,760
companies and different professors but
 

1569
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,450
companies and different professors but
they've been approved for burn victims

1570
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:50,460
they've been approved for burn victims
 

1571
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,220
they've been approved for burn victims
and for patients with diabetic skin

1572
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:52,230
and for patients with diabetic skin
 

1573
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:54,250
and for patients with diabetic skin
ulcers that's amazing

00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:54,260
ulcers that's amazing
 

1575
00:31:54,260 --> 00:32:00,440
ulcers that's amazing
okay so skin what else well at different

1576
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:00,450
okay so skin what else well at different
 

1577
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:03,680
okay so skin what else well at different
stages people are like skin blood

1578
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:03,690
stages people are like skin blood
 

1579
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:06,650
stages people are like skin blood
vessels there's clinical trials going

1580
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:06,660
vessels there's clinical trials going
 

1581
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:09,410
vessels there's clinical trials going
now for helping patients here better for

1582
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:09,420
now for helping patients here better for
 

1583
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:12,470
now for helping patients here better for
patients that might be paralyzed for

1584
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:12,480
patients that might be paralyzed for
 

1585
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,300
patients that might be paralyzed for
patients that have different hai

1586
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:14,310
patients that have different hai
 

1587
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:16,550
patients that have different hai
problems I'm you know at different

1588
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:16,560
problems I'm you know at different
 

1589
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,680
problems I'm you know at different
groups have worked on just about

1590
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:18,690
groups have worked on just about
 

1591
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:20,750
groups have worked on just about
everything new liver and who kidneys I

1592
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:20,760
everything new liver and who kidneys I
 

1593
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,600
everything new liver and who kidneys I
mean there have been all kinds of work

1594
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:23,610
mean there have been all kinds of work
 

1595
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:25,580
mean there have been all kinds of work
done in this area some of its early but

1596
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:25,590
done in this area some of its early but
 

1597
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:27,470
done in this area some of its early but
but there's certainly a lot of activity

1598
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:27,480
but there's certainly a lot of activity
 

1599
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:31,670
but there's certainly a lot of activity
what about neural tissue yeah nurten the

1600
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:31,680
what about neural tissue yeah nurten the
 

1601
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:34,340
what about neural tissue yeah nurten the
nervous system and even the brain while

1602
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:34,350
nervous system and even the brain while
 

1603
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:35,690
nervous system and even the brain while
there have been people out of working on

1604
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:35,700
there have been people out of working on
 

1605
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,160
there have been people out of working on
that too we've done a little bit with

1606
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:37,170
that too we've done a little bit with
 

1607
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:38,840
that too we've done a little bit with
that but there are people who've done a

1608
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:38,850
that but there are people who've done a
 

1609
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:41,360
that but there are people who've done a
lot on neural stem cells and I know Evan

1610
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:41,370
lot on neural stem cells and I know Evan
 

1611
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:42,530
lot on neural stem cells and I know Evan

works done work like that and ever been

1616
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:46,560
works done work like that and ever been

other people as well as their challenges

1618
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:49,140
other people as well as their challenges
 

1619
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:52,490
other people as well as their challenges
for the when it is part of the human

1620
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:52,500
for the when it is part of the human
 

1621
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,530
for the when it is part of the human
bodies there's challenges to getting the

1622
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:54,540
bodies there's challenges to getting the
 

1623
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,480
bodies there's challenges to getting the
the body to accept this new tissue

1624
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:56,490
the body to accept this new tissue
 

1625
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:58,550
the body to accept this new tissue
that's being generated how do you solve

1626
00:32:58,550 --> 00:32:58,560
that's being generated how do you solve
 

1627
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,500
that's being generated how do you solve
that kind of challenge there can be

1628
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:00,510
that kind of challenge there can be
 

1629
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:03,200
that kind of challenge there can be
problems with it accepting it I think

1630
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:03,210
problems with it accepting it I think
 

1631
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:05,000
problems with it accepting it I think
maybe in particular you might mean

1632
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:05,010
maybe in particular you might mean
 

1633
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:08,060
maybe in particular you might mean
rejection by the body so there are

1634
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:08,070
rejection by the body so there are
 

1635
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:09,440
rejection by the body so there are
multiple ways that people are trying to

1636
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:09,450
multiple ways that people are trying to
 

1637
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:12,590
multiple ways that people are trying to
deal with that one way is which was what

1638
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:12,600
deal with that one way is which was what
 

1639
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,050
deal with that one way is which was what
we've done and with Dan Anderson one of

1640
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:15,060
we've done and with Dan Anderson one of
 

1641
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,610
we've done and with Dan Anderson one of
my former postdocs and I mentioned this

1642
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:16,620
my former postdocs and I mentioned this
 

1643
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,560
my former postdocs and I mentioned this
a little bit before for a painted

1644
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:18,570
a little bit before for a painted
 

1645
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:21,020
a little bit before for a painted
pancreas is encapsulating the cell so

1646
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:21,030
pancreas is encapsulating the cell so
 

1647
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:25,370
pancreas is encapsulating the cell so
immune immune cells or antibodies can't

1648
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:25,380
immune immune cells or antibodies can't
 

1649
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,590
immune immune cells or antibodies can't
get in and attack them so that's a way

1650
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:27,600
get in and attack them so that's a way
 

1651
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,260
get in and attack them so that's a way
to protect them

1652
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:29,270
to protect them
 

1653
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:32,900
to protect them
other strategies could be making the

1654
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:32,910
other strategies could be making the
 

1655
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:34,940
other strategies could be making the
cells not immuno genic which might be

1656
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:34,950
cells not immuno genic which might be
 

1657
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:36,890
cells not immuno genic which might be
done by different either techniques

1658
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:36,900
done by different either techniques
 

1659
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:39,830
done by different either techniques
which might mask them or using some gene

1660
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:39,840
which might mask them or using some gene
 

1661
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,450
which might mask them or using some gene
editing approaches so they're different

1662
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:41,460
editing approaches so they're different
 

1663
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,860
editing approaches so they're different
ways that people are trying to do that

1664
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:42,870
ways that people are trying to do that
 

1665
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:44,900
ways that people are trying to do that
and of course if you use the patient's

1666
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:44,910
and of course if you use the patient's
 

1667
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:47,320
and of course if you use the patient's
own cells or cells from a close relative

1668
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:47,330
own cells or cells from a close relative
 

1669
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:50,300
own cells or cells from a close relative
doubt might be another way and it

1670
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:50,310
doubt might be another way and it
 

1671
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,710
doubt might be another way and it
increases the likelihood that they'll

1672
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:51,720
increases the likelihood that they'll
 

1673
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,630
increases the likelihood that they'll
get accepted if you use the patient's

1674
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:53,640
get accepted if you use the patient's
 

1675
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,270
get accepted if you use the patient's
own cells yes and then finally there's

1676
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:56,280
own cells yes and then finally there's
 

1677
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,830
own cells yes and then finally there's
some you know suppressive drugs which

1678
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:57,840
some you know suppressive drugs which
 

1679
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,720
some you know suppressive drugs which
you know will suppress the immune

1680
00:33:59,720 --> 00:33:59,730
you know will suppress the immune
 

1681
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:01,640
you know will suppress the immune
response that's right now what's done

1682
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:01,650
response that's right now what's done
 

1683
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:04,340
response that's right now what's done
say for a liver transplant the fact that

1684
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:04,350
say for a liver transplant the fact that
 

1685
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:06,020
say for a liver transplant the fact that
this whole thing works just fascinating

1686
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:06,030
this whole thing works just fascinating
 

1687
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:07,560
this whole thing works just fascinating
at least from my

1688
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:07,570
at least from my
 

1689
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:10,690
at least from my
outside perspective well we one day be

1690
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:10,700
outside perspective well we one day be
 

1691
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:13,750
outside perspective well we one day be
able to regenerate any organ or part of

1692
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:13,760
able to regenerate any organ or part of
 

1693
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,169
able to regenerate any organ or part of
the the human body in your view and it's

1694
00:34:17,169 --> 00:34:17,179
the the human body in your view and it's
 

1695
00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:18,340
the the human body in your view and it's
exciting to think about future

1696
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:18,350
exciting to think about future
 

1697
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:21,840
exciting to think about future
possibilities of tissue engineering is

1698
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:21,850
possibilities of tissue engineering is
 

1699
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:24,550
possibilities of tissue engineering is
do you see some tissues more difficult

1700
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:24,560
do you see some tissues more difficult
 

1701
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,169
do you see some tissues more difficult
than others what are the possibilities

1702
00:34:26,169 --> 00:34:26,179
than others what are the possibilities
 

1703
00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:28,869
than others what are the possibilities
here yeah Wow of course I'm an optimist

1704
00:34:28,869 --> 00:34:28,879
here yeah Wow of course I'm an optimist
 

1705
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:31,149
here yeah Wow of course I'm an optimist
and I also feel a timeframe if we're

1706
00:34:31,149 --> 00:34:31,159
and I also feel a timeframe if we're
 

1707
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:32,950
and I also feel a timeframe if we're
talking about some day some day could be

1708
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:32,960
talking about some day some day could be
 

1709
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,619
talking about some day some day could be
hundreds of years but I think that yes

1710
00:34:35,619 --> 00:34:35,629
hundreds of years but I think that yes
 

1711
00:34:35,629 --> 00:34:37,119
hundreds of years but I think that yes
some day I think we will be able to

1712
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:37,129
some day I think we will be able to
 

1713
00:34:37,129 --> 00:34:39,820
some day I think we will be able to
regenerate many things and our different

1714
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:39,830
regenerate many things and our different
 

1715
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:42,010
regenerate many things and our different
strategies that one might use the one

1716
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:42,020
strategies that one might use the one
 

1717
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:44,980
strategies that one might use the one
might use some cells themselves one

1718
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:44,990
might use some cells themselves one
 

1719
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:47,649
might use some cells themselves one
might use you know some molecules that

1720
00:34:47,649 --> 00:34:47,659
might use you know some molecules that
 

1721
00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:50,050
might use you know some molecules that
might help regenerate the cells and so I

1722
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:50,060
might help regenerate the cells and so I
 

1723
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:51,399
might help regenerate the cells and so I
think there are different possibilities

1724
00:34:51,399 --> 00:34:51,409
think there are different possibilities
 

1725
00:34:51,409 --> 00:34:52,950
think there are different possibilities
what do you think that means for

1726
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:52,960
what do you think that means for
 

1727
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,770
what do you think that means for
longevity if we look maybe not someday

1728
00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:56,780
longevity if we look maybe not someday
 

1729
00:34:56,780 --> 00:35:00,220
longevity if we look maybe not someday
but 10 20 years out are the

1730
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:00,230
but 10 20 years out are the
 

1731
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:01,720
but 10 20 years out are the
possibilities that tissue engineering

1732
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:01,730
possibilities that tissue engineering
 

1733
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:03,280
possibilities that tissue engineering
the possibilities of the research that

1734
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:03,290
the possibilities of the research that
 

1735
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:06,400
the possibilities of the research that
you're doing does it have a significant

1736
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:06,410
you're doing does it have a significant
 

1737
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:09,520
you're doing does it have a significant
impact on the longevity human life I

1738
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:09,530
impact on the longevity human life I
 

1739
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:11,380
impact on the longevity human life I
don't know that we'll see a radical

1740
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:11,390
don't know that we'll see a radical
 

1741
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:13,540
don't know that we'll see a radical
increase in longevity but I think that

1742
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:13,550
increase in longevity but I think that
 

1743
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:18,670
increase in longevity but I think that
in certain areas we'll see people live

1744
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:18,680
in certain areas we'll see people live
 

1745
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,680
in certain areas we'll see people live
better lives and maybe so somewhat

1746
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:20,690
better lives and maybe so somewhat
 

1747
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:23,590
better lives and maybe so somewhat
longer lives with the most beautiful

1748
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:23,600
longer lives with the most beautiful
 

1749
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,920
longer lives with the most beautiful
scientific idea in biology nearing that

1750
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:26,930
scientific idea in biology nearing that
 

1751
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:28,840
scientific idea in biology nearing that
you've come across in your years of

1752
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:28,850
you've come across in your years of
 

1753
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:33,609
you've come across in your years of
research I apologize for the romantic no

1754
00:35:33,609 --> 00:35:33,619
research I apologize for the romantic no
 

1755
00:35:33,619 --> 00:35:35,320
research I apologize for the romantic no
that's an interesting question I

1756
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:35,330
that's an interesting question I
 

1757
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:37,599
that's an interesting question I
certainly think what is happening right

1758
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:37,609
certainly think what is happening right
 

1759
00:35:37,609 --> 00:35:39,730
certainly think what is happening right
now with CRISPR is a beautiful idea that

1760
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:39,740
now with CRISPR is a beautiful idea that
 

1761
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:42,430
now with CRISPR is a beautiful idea that
certainly wasn't wasn't my idea I mean

1762
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:42,440
certainly wasn't wasn't my idea I mean
 

1763
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,380
certainly wasn't wasn't my idea I mean
but you know I think it's very

1764
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:44,390
but you know I think it's very
 

1765
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:47,740
but you know I think it's very
interesting here what what people have

1766
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:47,750
interesting here what what people have
 

1767
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:50,080
interesting here what what people have
capitalized on is that there's a

1768
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:50,090
capitalized on is that there's a
 

1769
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:53,530
capitalized on is that there's a
mechanism by which bacteria are able to

1770
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:53,540
mechanism by which bacteria are able to
 

1771
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:56,710
mechanism by which bacteria are able to
destroy viruses and that understanding

1772
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:56,720
destroy viruses and that understanding
 

1773
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:00,010
destroy viruses and that understanding
that let leads the machinery to to put

1774
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:00,020
that let leads the machinery to to put
 

1775
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:03,880
that let leads the machinery to to put
you know to sort of cut and paste genes

1776
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:03,890
you know to sort of cut and paste genes
 

1777
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:07,240
you know to sort of cut and paste genes
and and you know fix the cell so that

1778
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:07,250
and and you know fix the cell so that
 

1779
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:09,820
and and you know fix the cell so that
kind of you see a promise for that kind

1780
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:09,830
kind of you see a promise for that kind
 

1781
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:13,930
kind of you see a promise for that kind
of ability to copy and paste I mean

1782
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:13,940
of ability to copy and paste I mean
 

1783
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:15,490
of ability to copy and paste I mean
everything like we said the human body

1784
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:15,500
everything like we said the human body
 

1785
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:16,940
everything like we said the human body
is complicated

1786
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:16,950
is complicated
 

1787
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:23,660
is complicated
is that Mele difficult to do I think it

1788
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:23,670
is that Mele difficult to do I think it
 

1789
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:25,430
is that Mele difficult to do I think it
is exceptionally difficult to do but

1790
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:25,440
is exceptionally difficult to do but
 

1791
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,740
is exceptionally difficult to do but
that doesn't mean they won't be done

1792
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:27,750
that doesn't mean they won't be done
 

1793
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:29,180
that doesn't mean they won't be done
there's a lot of companies and people

1794
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:29,190
there's a lot of companies and people
 

1795
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:31,040
there's a lot of companies and people
trying to do it and I think in some

1796
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:31,050
trying to do it and I think in some
 

1797
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:33,079
trying to do it and I think in some
areas it will be done some of the ways

1798
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:33,089
areas it will be done some of the ways
 

1799
00:36:33,089 --> 00:36:36,349
areas it will be done some of the ways
that make you might lower the bar are

1800
00:36:36,349 --> 00:36:36,359
that make you might lower the bar are
 

1801
00:36:36,359 --> 00:36:39,380
that make you might lower the bar are
not you know are just taking look like

1802
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:39,390
not you know are just taking look like
 

1803
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:41,060
not you know are just taking look like
not necessarily doing it directly but

1804
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:41,070
not necessarily doing it directly but
 

1805
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:43,849
not necessarily doing it directly but
you know you could take a cell that

1806
00:36:43,849 --> 00:36:43,859
you know you could take a cell that
 

1807
00:36:43,859 --> 00:36:46,520
you know you could take a cell that
might be useful but you want to give it

1808
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:46,530
might be useful but you want to give it
 

1809
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:48,650
might be useful but you want to give it
some cancer-killing capabilities

1810
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:48,660
some cancer-killing capabilities
 

1811
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:50,060
some cancer-killing capabilities
something collect what's called the cart

1812
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:50,070
something collect what's called the cart
 

1813
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:52,250
something collect what's called the cart
C cell and that might be a different way

1814
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:52,260
C cell and that might be a different way
 

1815
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:54,230
C cell and that might be a different way
of somehow making a cart C cell and

1816
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:54,240
of somehow making a cart C cell and
 

1817
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,900
of somehow making a cart C cell and
maybe making it better so there might be

1818
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:56,910
maybe making it better so there might be
 

1819
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:59,870
maybe making it better so there might be
sort of easier things and rather than

1820
00:36:59,870 --> 00:36:59,880
sort of easier things and rather than
 

1821
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,359
sort of easier things and rather than
just fixing the whole body so the way a

1822
00:37:02,359 --> 00:37:02,369
just fixing the whole body so the way a
 

1823
00:37:02,369 --> 00:37:04,069
just fixing the whole body so the way a
lot of things have moved to in medicine

1824
00:37:04,069 --> 00:37:04,079
lot of things have moved to in medicine
 

1825
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:07,160
lot of things have moved to in medicine
over time is stepwise so I can see

1826
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:07,170
over time is stepwise so I can see
 

1827
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:10,400
over time is stepwise so I can see
things that might be easier to do than

1828
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:10,410
things that might be easier to do than
 

1829
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:12,680
things that might be easier to do than
say fix a brain that would be very hard

1830
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:12,690
say fix a brain that would be very hard
 

1831
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:15,260
say fix a brain that would be very hard
to do but maybe someday that'll happen

1832
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:15,270
to do but maybe someday that'll happen
 

1833
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:17,780
to do but maybe someday that'll happen
too so in terms of stepwise that's the

1834
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:17,790
too so in terms of stepwise that's the
 

1835
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:20,750
too so in terms of stepwise that's the
interesting notion do you see that if

1836
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:20,760
interesting notion do you see that if
 

1837
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:24,430
interesting notion do you see that if
you look at medicine or bioengineering

1838
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:24,440
you look at medicine or bioengineering
 

1839
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:28,550
you look at medicine or bioengineering
do you see that there is these big leaps

1840
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:28,560
do you see that there is these big leaps
 

1841
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,670
do you see that there is these big leaps
that happen every decade or so or some

1842
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:31,680
that happen every decade or so or some
 

1843
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,819
that happen every decade or so or some
distant period or is it a lot of

1844
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:34,829
distant period or is it a lot of
 

1845
00:37:34,829 --> 00:37:37,579
distant period or is it a lot of
incremental work not I don't mean to

1846
00:37:37,579 --> 00:37:37,589
incremental work not I don't mean to
 

1847
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:39,440
incremental work not I don't mean to
reduce its impact by saying it's

1848
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:39,450
reduce its impact by saying it's
 

1849
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:43,280
reduce its impact by saying it's
incremental but yeah is there sort of

1850
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:43,290
incremental but yeah is there sort of
 

1851
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:46,910
incremental but yeah is there sort of
phase shifts in in the science big big

1852
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:46,920
phase shifts in in the science big big
 

1853
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:47,540
phase shifts in in the science big big
leaps

1854
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:47,550
leaps
 

1855
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:50,059
leaps
I think there's both you know every so

1856
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:50,069
I think there's both you know every so
 

1857
00:37:50,069 --> 00:37:52,130
I think there's both you know every so
often a new technique or new technology

1858
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:52,140
often a new technique or new technology
 

1859
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:53,089
often a new technique or new technology
comes out

1860
00:37:53,089 --> 00:37:53,099
comes out
 

1861
00:37:53,099 --> 00:37:55,970
comes out
I mean genetic engineering was an

1862
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:55,980
I mean genetic engineering was an
 

1863
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:58,640
I mean genetic engineering was an
example I mentioned CRISPR you know I

1864
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:58,650
example I mentioned CRISPR you know I
 

1865
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:01,400
example I mentioned CRISPR you know I
think every so often things happen that

1866
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:01,410
think every so often things happen that
 

1867
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:03,829
think every so often things happen that
you know make a big difference but still

1868
00:38:03,829 --> 00:38:03,839
you know make a big difference but still
 

1869
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:07,220
you know make a big difference but still
there's to try to really make progress

1870
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:07,230
there's to try to really make progress
 

1871
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:09,140
there's to try to really make progress
make a new drug make a new device

1872
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:09,150
make a new drug make a new device
 

1873
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:11,750
make a new drug make a new device
there's a lot of things I don't know if

1874
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:11,760
there's a lot of things I don't know if
 

1875
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,130
there's a lot of things I don't know if
I'd call them incremental but there's a

1876
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:13,140
I'd call them incremental but there's a
 

1877
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,950
I'd call them incremental but there's a
lot a lot of work that needs to be done

1878
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:14,960
lot a lot of work that needs to be done
 

1879
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:19,819
lot a lot of work that needs to be done
absolutely so you have over numbers

1880
00:38:19,819 --> 00:38:19,829
absolutely so you have over numbers
 

1881
00:38:19,829 --> 00:38:22,099
absolutely so you have over numbers
could be off but it's a big amount you

1882
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:22,109
could be off but it's a big amount you
 

1883
00:38:22,109 --> 00:38:24,230
could be off but it's a big amount you
have over 1100 current or pending

1884
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:24,240

your view

1890
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:31,470
your view
 

1891
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:34,080
your view
would in your view are the strengths and

1892
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:34,090
would in your view are the strengths and
 

1893
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:35,760
would in your view are the strengths and
what are the drawbacks of the patenting

1894
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:35,770
what are the drawbacks of the patenting
 

1895
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:39,120
what are the drawbacks of the patenting
process well I think for the most part

1896
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:39,130
process well I think for the most part
 

1897
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:40,680
process well I think for the most part
their strengths I think that if you

1898
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:40,690
their strengths I think that if you
 

1899
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:43,650
their strengths I think that if you
didn't have patents especially in

1900
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:43,660
didn't have patents especially in
 

1901
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:44,340
didn't have patents especially in
medicine

1902
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:44,350
medicine
 

1903
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:45,810
medicine
you'd never get the funding that it

1904
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:45,820
you'd never get the funding that it
 

1905
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:48,120
you'd never get the funding that it
takes to make a new drug or a new device

1906
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:48,130
takes to make a new drug or a new device
 

1907
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:50,520
takes to make a new drug or a new device
I mean which according to Tufts to make

1908
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:50,530
I mean which according to Tufts to make
 

1909
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:51,960
I mean which according to Tufts to make
a new drug costs over two billion

1910
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:51,970
a new drug costs over two billion
 

1911
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:54,930
a new drug costs over two billion
dollars right now and nobody would even

1912
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:54,940
dollars right now and nobody would even
 

1913
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:56,760
dollars right now and nobody would even
come close to giving you that money any

1914
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:56,770
come close to giving you that money any
 

1915
00:38:56,770 --> 00:39:00,600
come close to giving you that money any
of that money if if it weren't for the

1916
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:00,610
of that money if if it weren't for the
 

1917
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:02,850
of that money if if it weren't for the
patent system because and then anybody

1918
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:02,860
patent system because and then anybody
 

1919
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:07,470
patent system because and then anybody
else could do it that that that then

1920
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:07,480
else could do it that that that then
 

1921
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,930
else could do it that that that then
leads to the negative though you know

1922
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:09,940
leads to the negative though you know
 

1923
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,850
leads to the negative though you know
sometimes somebody does up a very

1924
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:11,860
sometimes somebody does up a very
 

1925
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:14,400
sometimes somebody does up a very
successful drug and you certainly want

1926
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:14,410
successful drug and you certainly want
 

1927
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:16,560
successful drug and you certainly want
to try to make it available to everybody

1928
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:16,570
to try to make it available to everybody
 

1929
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:21,870
to try to make it available to everybody
and and so the patent system allows it

1930
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:21,880
and and so the patent system allows it
 

1931
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,210
and and so the patent system allows it
allowed it happen in the first place but

1932
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:24,220
allowed it happen in the first place but
 

1933
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:26,580
allowed it happen in the first place but
maybe it'll impede it after a little bit

1934
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:26,590
maybe it'll impede it after a little bit
 

1935
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:28,770
maybe it'll impede it after a little bit
or certainly to some people or some

1936
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:28,780
or certainly to some people or some
 

1937
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:31,470
or certainly to some people or some
companies you know once it's once it is

1938
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:31,480
companies you know once it's once it is
 

1939
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:35,070
companies you know once it's once it is
out there what's the on the point of the

00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:35,080
out there what's the on the point of the
 

1941
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,410
out there what's the on the point of the
cost what would you say is the most

1942
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:37,420
cost what would you say is the most
 

1943
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:39,840
cost what would you say is the most
expensive part of the two billion

1944
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:39,850
expensive part of the two billion
 

1945
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:42,240
expensive part of the two billion
dollars of making the drug given

dollars of making the drug given
 

1947
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:45,360
dollars of making the drug given
clinical trials that is by far the most

1948
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:45,370
clinical trials that is by far the most
 

1949
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:48,930
clinical trials that is by far the most

something new is safe and effective
 

1959
00:39:57,730 --> 00:40:00,240
something new is safe and effective
in people this is almost always the

00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:02,320
biggest expense could you linger on that
 

1963
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,620
biggest expense could you linger on that
for just a little longer and describe

1964
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:04,630
for just a little longer and describe
 

1965
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:07,830
for just a little longer and describe
what it takes to prove for people that

1966
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:07,840
what it takes to prove for people that
 

1967
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:11,160
what it takes to prove for people that
don't know in general what it takes to

1968
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:11,170
don't know in general what it takes to
 

1969
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:12,540
don't know in general what it takes to
prove that something is effective on

00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:12,550
prove that something is effective on
 

1971
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:17,040
prove that something is effective on
humans well you'd have to take at this

1972
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:17,050
humans well you'd have to take at this
 

1973
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:19,440
humans well you'd have to take at this
particular disease but what the process

1974
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:19,450
particular disease but what the process
 

1975
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:21,750
particular disease but what the process
is you start out with so usually you

1976
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:21,760
is you start out with so usually you
 

1977
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,340
is you start out with so usually you
start out with cells then you'd go to

1978
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:23,350
start out with cells then you'd go to
 

1979
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:24,990
start out with cells then you'd go to
animal models usually you have to do a

1980
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:25,000
animal models usually you have to do a
 

1981
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,060
animal models usually you have to do a
couple of animal models and of course

1982
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:27,070
couple of animal models and of course
 

1983
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:28,590
couple of animal models and of course
the animal models aren't perfect for

1984
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:28,600
the animal models aren't perfect for
 

1985
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,510
the animal models aren't perfect for
humans and then you have to do three

1986
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:30,520
humans and then you have to do three
 

1987
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,430
humans and then you have to do three
sets of clinical trials at a minimum a

1988
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:32,440
sets of clinical trials at a minimum a
 

1989
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,710
sets of clinical trials at a minimum a
phase one trial to show that it's safe

1990
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:34,720
phase one trial to show that it's safe
 

1991
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,870
phase one trial to show that it's safe
and small number of patients face to

1992
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:36,880
and small number of patients face to
 

1993
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,340
and small number of patients face to
trial to show that it's effective in a

1994
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:38,350
trial to show that it's effective in a
 

1995
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:40,320
trial to show that it's effective in a
small number of patients and a phase

1996
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:40,330
small number of patients and a phase
 

1997
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:42,210
small number of patients and a phase
three trial to show that a safe and

1998
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:42,220
three trial to show that a safe and
 

1999
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:44,400
three trial to show that a safe and
effective in a large number of pay

2000
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:44,410
effective in a large number of pay
 

2001
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:47,130
effective in a large number of pay
and you know that could end up being

2002
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:47,140
and you know that could end up being
 

2003
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:49,890
and you know that could end up being
hundreds or thousands of patients and

2004
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:49,900
hundreds or thousands of patients and
 

2005
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,930
hundreds or thousands of patients and
they have to be really carefully

2006
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:51,940
they have to be really carefully
 

2007
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:54,240
they have to be really carefully
controlled studies and you know you'd

2008
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:54,250
controlled studies and you know you'd
 

2009
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:56,009
controlled studies and you know you'd
have to manufacture the drug you'd have

2010
00:40:56,009 --> 00:40:56,019
have to manufacture the drug you'd have
 

2011
00:40:56,019 --> 00:40:58,980
have to manufacture the drug you'd have
to you know really watch those patients

2012
00:40:58,980 --> 00:40:58,990
to you know really watch those patients
 

2013
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:01,109
to you know really watch those patients
you have to be very concerned if you

2014
00:41:01,109 --> 00:41:01,119
you have to be very concerned if you
 

2015
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:03,420
you have to be very concerned if you
know that that it is gonna be safe and

2016
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:03,430
know that that it is gonna be safe and
 

2017
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:06,210
know that that it is gonna be safe and
and and and you look at see does it

2018
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:06,220
and and and you look at see does it
 

2019
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:07,859
and and and you look at see does it
doesn't treat the disease better than

2020
00:41:07,859 --> 00:41:07,869
doesn't treat the disease better than
 

2021
00:41:07,869 --> 00:41:10,079
doesn't treat the disease better than
what the whatever the gold standard was

2022
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:10,089
what the whatever the gold standard was
 

2023
00:41:10,089 --> 00:41:12,210
what the whatever the gold standard was
before that if there was assuming there

2024
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:12,220
before that if there was assuming there
 

2025
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,980
before that if there was assuming there
was one that's a really interesting line

2026
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:13,990
was one that's a really interesting line
 

2027
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:16,859
was one that's a really interesting line
show that it's safe first and then that

2028
00:41:16,859 --> 00:41:16,869
show that it's safe first and then that
 

2029
00:41:16,869 --> 00:41:19,319
show that it's safe first and then that
it's effective first do no harm

2030
00:41:19,319 --> 00:41:19,329
it's effective first do no harm
 

2031
00:41:19,329 --> 00:41:23,569
it's effective first do no harm
first do no harm that's right so how

2032
00:41:23,569 --> 00:41:23,579
first do no harm that's right so how
 

2033
00:41:23,579 --> 00:41:26,249
first do no harm that's right so how
again if you can linger it a little bit

2034
00:41:26,249 --> 00:41:26,259
again if you can linger it a little bit
 

2035
00:41:26,259 --> 00:41:29,519
again if you can linger it a little bit
how does the patenting process work yeah

2036
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:29,529
how does the patenting process work yeah
 

2037
00:41:29,529 --> 00:41:31,380
how does the patenting process work yeah
well you you do a certain amount of

2038
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:31,390
well you you do a certain amount of
 

2039
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:34,109
well you you do a certain amount of
research though that's not necessarily

2040
00:41:34,109 --> 00:41:34,119
research though that's not necessarily
 

2041
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:36,299
research though that's not necessarily
has to be the case but you for us

2042
00:41:36,299 --> 00:41:36,309
has to be the case but you for us
 

2043
00:41:36,309 --> 00:41:38,370
has to be the case but you for us
usually it is usually we do a certain

2044
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:38,380
usually it is usually we do a certain
 

2045
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:41,400
usually it is usually we do a certain
amount of research and make some

2046
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:41,410
amount of research and make some
 

2047
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:44,730
amount of research and make some
findings and you know we had a

2048
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:44,740
findings and you know we had a
 

2049
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:46,799
findings and you know we had a
hypothesis let's say we prove it or we

2050
00:41:46,799 --> 00:41:46,809
hypothesis let's say we prove it or we
 

2051
00:41:46,809 --> 00:41:48,480
hypothesis let's say we prove it or we
make some discovery we need to invent

2052
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:48,490
make some discovery we need to invent
 

2053
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:50,880
make some discovery we need to invent
some technique and then we write

2054
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:50,890
some technique and then we write
 

2055
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:52,470
some technique and then we write
something up what's called a disclosure

2056
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:52,480
something up what's called a disclosure
 

2057
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,410
something up what's called a disclosure
we give it to MIT technology transfer

2058
00:41:55,410 --> 00:41:55,420
we give it to MIT technology transfer
 

2059
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:57,539
we give it to MIT technology transfer
office they then give it to some patent

2060
00:41:57,539 --> 00:41:57,549
office they then give it to some patent
 

2061
00:41:57,549 --> 00:42:00,299
office they then give it to some patent
attorneys and they use that and plus

2062
00:42:00,299 --> 00:42:00,309
attorneys and they use that and plus
 

2063

talking to us and you know work on
 

2065
00:42:02,619 --> 00:42:05,249
talking to us and you know work on
writing a patent and then you go back

2066
00:42:05,249 --> 00:42:05,259
writing a patent and then you go back
 

2067
00:42:05,259 --> 00:42:08,190
writing a patent and then you go back
and forth with the USPTO that's the

twenty three billion dollars you've
 

2089
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:35,880
twenty three billion dollars you've
described your thoughts on a formula for

2090
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:35,890
described your thoughts on a formula for
 

2091
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:37,799
described your thoughts on a formula for
startup success so perhaps you can

2092
00:42:37,799 --> 00:42:37,809
startup success so perhaps you can
 

2093
00:42:37,809 --> 00:42:39,599
startup success so perhaps you can
describe that formula in general

2094
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:39,609
describe that formula in general
 

2095
00:42:39,609 --> 00:42:42,089
describe that formula in general
describe what does it take to build a

describe what does it take to build a
 

2097
00:42:42,099 --> 00:42:45,299
describe what does it take to build a
successful startup well I I break that

2098
00:42:45,299 --> 00:42:45,309
successful startup well I I break that
 

2099
00:42:45,309 --> 00:42:46,799
successful startup well I I break that
down into a couple categories and I'm

2100
00:42:46,799 --> 00:42:46,809
down into a couple categories and I'm
 

2101
00:42:46,809 --> 00:42:48,870
down into a couple categories and I'm
I'm a scientist and certainly from the

2102
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:48,880
I'm a scientist and certainly from the
 

2103
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,849
I'm a scientist and certainly from the
science standpoint I'll go over that but

2104
00:42:50,849 --> 00:42:50,859
science standpoint I'll go over that but
 

2105
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:53,519
science standpoint I'll go over that but
I actually think that really the most

2106
00:42:53,519 --> 00:42:53,529
I actually think that really the most
 

2107
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:55,410
I actually think that really the most
important thing is probably the business

2108
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:55,420
important thing is probably the business
 

2109
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:57,250
important thing is probably the business
people then that

2110
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:57,260
people then that
 

2111
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:59,410
people then that
work with and you know they when I look

2112
00:42:59,410 --> 00:42:59,420
work with and you know they when I look
 

2113
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:00,550
work with and you know they when I look
back at the companies that have done

2114
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:00,560
back at the companies that have done
 

2115
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,710
back at the companies that have done
well it's been because we've had great

2116
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:02,720
well it's been because we've had great
 

2117
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,780
well it's been because we've had great
business people and when they haven't

2118
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:04,790
business people and when they haven't
 

2119
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:06,250
business people and when they haven't
done as well we have it as good business

2120
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:06,260
done as well we have it as good business
 

2121
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:08,410
done as well we have it as good business
people but from a science standpoint I

2122
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:08,420
people but from a science standpoint I
 

2123
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:10,720
people but from a science standpoint I
think about that we've made some kind of

2124
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:10,730
think about that we've made some kind of
 

2125
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:14,740
think about that we've made some kind of
discovery that is almost what I'd call a

2126
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:14,750
discovery that is almost what I'd call a
 

2127
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:16,030
discovery that is almost what I'd call a
platform that you could use it for

2128
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:16,040
platform that you could use it for
 

2129
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:19,000
platform that you could use it for
different things and certainly the drug

2130
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:19,010
different things and certainly the drug
 

2131
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:20,800
different things and certainly the drug
delivery system example that I gave

2132
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:20,810
delivery system example that I gave
 

2133
00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:22,690
delivery system example that I gave
earlier z' is a good example of that you

2134
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:22,700
earlier z' is a good example of that you
 

2135
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:25,560
earlier z' is a good example of that you
could use it for drug ABCDE and so forth

2136
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:25,570
could use it for drug ABCDE and so forth
 

2137
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:29,470
could use it for drug ABCDE and so forth
and that I'd like to think that we've

2138
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:29,480
and that I'd like to think that we've
 

2139
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:30,820
and that I'd like to think that we've
taken it far enough so that we've

2140
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:30,830
taken it far enough so that we've
 

2141
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:33,070
taken it far enough so that we've
written at least one really good paper

2142
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:33,080
written at least one really good paper
 

2143
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:35,400
written at least one really good paper
and a top journal hopefully a number

2144
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:35,410
and a top journal hopefully a number
 

2145
00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:37,900
and a top journal hopefully a number
that we've reduced it to practice in

2146
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:37,910
that we've reduced it to practice in
 

2147
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:43,780
that we've reduced it to practice in
animal models that we've filed patents

2148
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:43,790
animal models that we've filed patents
 

2149
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:46,120
animal models that we've filed patents
maybe I had issued patents that of what

2150
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:46,130
maybe I had issued patents that of what
 

2151
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:48,130
maybe I had issued patents that of what
I'll call very good and broad claims

2152
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:48,140
I'll call very good and broad claims
 

2153
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:50,740
I'll call very good and broad claims
that's sort of the key in a patent and

2154
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:50,750
that's sort of the key in a patent and
 

2155
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:53,350
that's sort of the key in a patent and
then in our case a lot of times when

2156
00:43:53,350 --> 00:43:53,360
then in our case a lot of times when
 

2157
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,780
then in our case a lot of times when
we've done it a lot of times it's

2158
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:55,790
we've done it a lot of times it's
 

2159
00:43:55,790 --> 00:43:58,570
we've done it a lot of times it's
somebody in the lab like a postdoc or

2160
00:43:58,570 --> 00:43:58,580
somebody in the lab like a postdoc or
 

2161
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:00,910
somebody in the lab like a postdoc or
graduate student spent a big part of

2162
00:44:00,910 --> 00:44:00,920
graduate student spent a big part of
 

2163
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,830
graduate student spent a big part of
their life doing it and that they want

2164
00:44:02,830 --> 00:44:02,840
their life doing it and that they want
 

2165
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,000
their life doing it and that they want
to work at that company because they

2166
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:04,010
to work at that company because they
 

2167
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:05,470
to work at that company because they
have this passion that they want to see

2168
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:05,480
have this passion that they want to see
 

2169
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,330
have this passion that they want to see
something they did make a difference in

2170
00:44:07,330 --> 00:44:07,340
something they did make a difference in
 

2171
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:10,510
something they did make a difference in
people's lives maybe you could mention

2172
00:44:10,510 --> 00:44:10,520
people's lives maybe you could mention
 

2173
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:14,140
people's lives maybe you could mention
the business component it's funny to

2174
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:14,150
the business component it's funny to
 

2175
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:15,640
the business component it's funny to
hear great side to say that there's

2176
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:15,650
hear great side to say that there's
 

2177
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:17,350
hear great side to say that there's
value to business folks

2178
00:44:17,350 --> 00:44:17,360
value to business folks
 

2179
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:20,860
value to business folks
oh yeah well that always said so what

2180
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:20,870
oh yeah well that always said so what
 

2181
00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:24,430
oh yeah well that always said so what
what value what business instinct is

2182
00:44:24,430 --> 00:44:24,440
what value what business instinct is
 

2183
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:27,880
what value what business instinct is
valuable to make a startup successful a

2184
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:27,890
valuable to make a startup successful a
 

2185
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:30,670
valuable to make a startup successful a
company successful I think the business

2186
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:30,680
company successful I think the business
 

2187
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:34,540
company successful I think the business
aspects are you have to be a good judge

2188
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:34,550
aspects are you have to be a good judge
 

2189
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:36,640
aspects are you have to be a good judge
of people so that you hire the right

2190
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:36,650
of people so that you hire the right
 

2191
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:39,760
of people so that you hire the right
people you have to be strategic so you

2192
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:39,770
people you have to be strategic so you
 

2193
00:44:39,770 --> 00:44:41,530
people you have to be strategic so you
figure out if you do of that platform

2194
00:44:41,530 --> 00:44:41,540
figure out if you do of that platform
 

2195
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:42,850
figure out if you do of that platform
that could be used for all these

2196
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:42,860
that could be used for all these
 

2197
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:44,920
that could be used for all these
different things what one are you and

2198
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:44,930
different things what one are you and
 

2199
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:46,780
different things what one are you and
knowing that medical research is so

2200
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:46,790
knowing that medical research is so
 

2201
00:44:46,790 --> 00:44:48,580
knowing that medical research is so
expensive what thing are you gonna do

2202
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:48,590
expensive what thing are you gonna do
 

2203
00:44:48,590 --> 00:44:51,330
expensive what thing are you gonna do
first second third fourth and fifth I

2204
00:44:51,330 --> 00:44:51,340
first second third fourth and fifth I
 

2205
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:53,860
first second third fourth and fifth I
think you need to have a good Lex what

2206
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:53,870
think you need to have a good Lex what
 

2207
00:44:53,870 --> 00:44:55,900
think you need to have a good Lex what
I'll call FDA regulatory clinical trial

2208
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:55,910
I'll call FDA regulatory clinical trial
 

2209
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:59,410
I'll call FDA regulatory clinical trial
trial strategy I think you have to be

2210
00:44:59,410 --> 00:44:59,420
trial strategy I think you have to be
 

2211
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:00,250
trial strategy I think you have to be
able to raise money

2212

able to raise money
 

2213
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:02,500
able to raise money
incredibly so there are a lot of things

incredibly so there are a lot of things
 

2215
00:45:02,510 --> 00:45:03,970
incredibly so there are a lot of things
you have to be a good good with people

2216

2231
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:23,740
is not being too always too good at that
process well I think there a part of the

2232
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:23,750
process well I think there a part of the
 

2233
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:26,800
process well I think there a part of the
process but I'd say there's probably I'm

2234
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:26,810
process but I'd say there's probably I'm
 

2235
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:29,230
process but I'd say there's probably I'm
gonna just make this up but maybe six or

2236
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:29,240
gonna just make this up but maybe six or

it's not just science I mean the kinds

2240
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:34,010
it's not just science I mean the kinds
 

2241
00:45:34,010 --> 00:45:35,829
it's not just science I mean the kinds
of things that I would think about is is

of things that I would think about is is
 

2243
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:38,950
of things that I would think about is is
the market big or small is the art there

2244
00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:38,960
the market big or small is the art there
 

2245
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,380

are there good animal models for it so

2246
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:41,390
are there good animal models for it so
 

2247
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:42,819
are there good animal models for it so
that you could test it and it wouldn't

2248
00:45:42,819 --> 00:45:42,829
that you could test it and it wouldn't
 

2249
00:45:42,829 --> 00:45:45,940
that you could test it and it wouldn't
take you know fifty years are the

2250
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:45,950
take you know fifty years are the
 

2251
00:45:45,950 --> 00:45:47,770
take you know fifty years are the
clinical trials that could be set up

2252
00:45:47,770 --> 00:45:47,780
clinical trials that could be set up
 

2253
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:51,910
clinical trials that could be set up
ones that you know have clear end points

2254
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:51,920
ones that you know have clear end points
 

2255
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:55,980
ones that you know have clear end points
where you can make a judgement and and

2256
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:55,990
where you can make a judgement and and
 

2257
00:45:55,990 --> 00:45:58,930
where you can make a judgement and and
another issue would be competition are

2258
00:45:58,930 --> 00:45:58,940
another issue would be competition are
 

2259
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:00,520
another issue would be competition are
there other ways that some companies out

2260
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:00,530
there other ways that some companies out
 

2261
00:46:00,530 --> 00:46:03,599
there other ways that some companies out
there or doing it another issue would be

2262
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:03,609
there or doing it another issue would be
 

2263
00:46:03,609 --> 00:46:07,030

reimbursement you know can I get

2264
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:07,040
reimbursement you know can I get
 

2265
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,800
reimbursement you know can I get
reimbursed so a lot of things that you

2266
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:08,810
reimbursed so a lot of things that you
 

2267
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:10,510
reimbursed so a lot of things that you
have manufacturing issues you'd want to

have manufacturing issues you'd want to
 

2269
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,760
have manufacturing issues you'd want to
consider is it not so I think there are

2270
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:12,770
consider is it not so I think there are
 

2271
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,050
consider is it not so I think there are
really a lot of things that go into

2272
00:46:14,050 --> 00:46:14,060
really a lot of things that go into
 

2273
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:16,720
really a lot of things that go into
whether you do what you do for a second

2274
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:16,730
whether you do what you do for a second
 

2275
00:46:16,730 --> 00:46:20,170
whether you do what you do for a second
third or fourth so you lead one of the

2276
00:46:20,170 --> 00:46:20,180
third or fourth so you lead one of the
 

2277
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:23,260
third or fourth so you lead one of the
largest academic labs in the world with

2278
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:23,270
largest academic labs in the world with

grants and over 100 researchers probably

2282
00:46:28,930 --> 00:46:28,940
grants and over 100 researchers probably
 

2283
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:32,609
grants and over 100 researchers probably
over a thousand since the labs beginning

2284
00:46:32,609 --> 00:46:32,619
over a thousand since the labs beginning
 

2285
00:46:32,619 --> 00:46:35,250
over a thousand since the labs beginning
researchers can be individualistic and

2286

researchers can be individualistic and
 

2287
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:38,140
researchers can be individualistic and
eccentric I don't put it nicely

2288
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:38,150
eccentric I don't put it nicely
 

2289
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:40,690
eccentric I don't put it nicely
there you go eccentric so what insights

2290
00:46:40,690 --> 00:46:40,700
there you go eccentric so what insights
 

2291
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:42,849
there you go eccentric so what insights
into research leadership can you give

2292
00:46:42,849 --> 00:46:42,859
into research leadership can you give
 

2293
00:46:42,859 --> 00:46:45,430
into research leadership can you give
having to run such a successful lab was

2294
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:45,440
having to run such a successful lab was
 

2295
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:49,809
having to run such a successful lab was
so much diverse talent well I don't know

2296
00:46:49,809 --> 00:46:49,819
so much diverse talent well I don't know
 

2297
00:46:49,819 --> 00:46:51,460
so much diverse talent well I don't know
that I'm any expert I think that what

2298
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:51,470
that I'm any expert I think that what
 

2299
00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:54,970
that I'm any expert I think that what
you do to me I mean I just want that

2300
00:46:54,970 --> 00:46:54,980
you do to me I mean I just want that
 

2301
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:56,470
you do to me I mean I just want that
missus gonna sound very simplistic but I

2302
00:46:56,470 --> 00:46:56,480
missus gonna sound very simplistic but I
 

2303
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,270
missus gonna sound very simplistic but I
just want people in the lab to be happy

2304
00:46:58,270 --> 00:46:58,280
just want people in the lab to be happy
 

2305
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:01,089
just want people in the lab to be happy
to be doing things that I hope will make

2306
00:47:01,089 --> 00:47:01,099
to be doing things that I hope will make
 

2307
00:47:01,099 --> 00:47:03,819
to be doing things that I hope will make
the world a better place to be working

2308
00:47:03,819 --> 00:47:03,829
the world a better place to be working
 

2309
00:47:03,829 --> 00:47:05,530
the world a better place to be working
on science that can make the world a

2310
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:05,540
on science that can make the world a
 

2311
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:07,900
on science that can make the world a
better place and I guess my feeling is

2312
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:07,910
better place and I guess my feeling is
 

2313
00:47:07,910 --> 00:47:11,920
better place and I guess my feeling is
if we're able to do that you know Peter

2314
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:11,930
if we're able to do that you know Peter
 

2315
00:47:11,930 --> 00:47:14,770
if we're able to do that you know Peter
it kind of runs itself so how do you

2316
00:47:14,770 --> 00:47:14,780
it kind of runs itself so how do you
 

2317
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:16,660
it kind of runs itself so how do you
make a researcher happy in general what

2318
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:16,670
make a researcher happy in general what
 

2319
00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:19,780
make a researcher happy in general what
I think when people feel I mean this is

2320
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:19,790
I think when people feel I mean this is
 

2321
00:47:19,790 --> 00:47:22,059
I think when people feel I mean this is
going to sound like again simplistic or

2322
00:47:22,059 --> 00:47:22,069
going to sound like again simplistic or
 

2323
00:47:22,069 --> 00:47:24,280
going to sound like again simplistic or
maybe like motherhood and apple pie but

2324
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:24,290
maybe like motherhood and apple pie but
 

2325
00:47:24,290 --> 00:47:26,140
maybe like motherhood and apple pie but
I think if people feel they're working

2326
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:26,150
I think if people feel they're working
 

2327
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:27,640
I think if people feel they're working
on something really important that can

2328
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:27,650
on something really important that can
 

2329
00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:29,950
on something really important that can
affect many other people's lives and

2330

come from many different ways sometimes
 

2349
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:57,130
come from many different ways sometimes
it's trying to things that I might think

2350
00:47:57,130 --> 00:47:57,140
it's trying to things that I might think
 

2351
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:58,900
it's trying to things that I might think
of or somebody in the lab might think of

2352
00:47:58,900 --> 00:47:58,910
of or somebody in the lab might think of
 

2353
00:47:58,910 --> 00:48:01,240
of or somebody in the lab might think of
which could be a new technique or to

2354
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:01,250
which could be a new technique or to
 

2355
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:03,190
which could be a new technique or to
understand something better but gee

2356
00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:03,200
understand something better but gee
 

2357
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,710
understand something better but gee
we've had people like Bill Gates and the

2358
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:05,720
we've had people like Bill Gates and the
 

2359
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:08,020
we've had people like Bill Gates and the
Gates Foundation come to us and Juvenile

2360
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:08,030
Gates Foundation come to us and Juvenile
 

2361
00:48:08,030 --> 00:48:10,030
Gates Foundation come to us and Juvenile
Diabetes Foundation come to us and say

2362
00:48:10,030 --> 00:48:10,040
Diabetes Foundation come to us and say
 

2363
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:11,500
Diabetes Foundation come to us and say
gee could you help us on these things

2364
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:11,510
gee could you help us on these things
 

2365
00:48:11,510 --> 00:48:14,170
gee could you help us on these things
and I mean that's good too it doesn't

2366
00:48:14,170 --> 00:48:14,180
and I mean that's good too it doesn't
 

2367
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:18,730
and I mean that's good too it doesn't
happen just one way and I mean you've

2368
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:18,740
happen just one way and I mean you've
 

2369
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:22,660
happen just one way and I mean you've
kind of mentioned it happiness but is

2370
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:22,670
kind of mentioned it happiness but is
 

2371
00:48:22,670 --> 00:48:25,360
kind of mentioned it happiness but is
there something more how do you inspire

2372
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:25,370
there something more how do you inspire
 

2373
00:48:25,370 --> 00:48:27,610
there something more how do you inspire
a researcher to do the best work of

2374
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:27,620
a researcher to do the best work of
 

2375
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:30,340
a researcher to do the best work of
their life so you mentioned passion and

2376
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:30,350
their life so you mentioned passion and
 

2377
00:48:30,350 --> 00:48:33,190
their life so you mentioned passion and
passion is a kind of fire do you see

2378
00:48:33,190 --> 00:48:33,200
passion is a kind of fire do you see
 

2379
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,440
passion is a kind of fire do you see
yourself having a role to keep that fire

2380
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:35,450
yourself having a role to keep that fire
 

2381
00:48:35,450 --> 00:48:39,220
yourself having a role to keep that fire
going to to build it up to inspire the

2382
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:39,230
going to to build it up to inspire the
 

2383
00:48:39,230 --> 00:48:41,680
going to to build it up to inspire the
researchers through the you know pretty

2384
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:41,690
researchers through the you know pretty
 

2385
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:45,810
researchers through the you know pretty
difficult process of going from idea to

2386
00:48:45,810 --> 00:48:45,820
difficult process of going from idea to
 

2387
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:50,170
difficult process of going from idea to
too big question to big answer I think

2388
00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:50,180
too big question to big answer I think
 

2389
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:54,400
too big question to big answer I think
so I think I try to do that by talking

2390
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:54,410
so I think I try to do that by talking
 

2391
00:48:54,410 --> 00:48:57,400
so I think I try to do that by talking
to people going over their ideas and

2392
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:57,410
to people going over their ideas and
 

2393
00:48:57,410 --> 00:49:00,760
to people going over their ideas and
their progress I try to do it as an

2394
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:00,770
their progress I try to do it as an
 

2395
00:49:00,770 --> 00:49:02,860
their progress I try to do it as an
individual you know certainly when I

2396
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:02,870
individual you know certainly when I
 

2397
00:49:02,870 --> 00:49:04,450
individual you know certainly when I
talk about my own career I had my

2398
00:49:04,450 --> 00:49:04,460
talk about my own career I had my
 

2399
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:07,060
talk about my own career I had my
setbacks s you know different times and

2400
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:07,070
setbacks s you know different times and
 

2401
00:49:07,070 --> 00:49:10,630
setbacks s you know different times and
people know that that know me and you

2402
00:49:10,630 --> 00:49:10,640
people know that that know me and you
 

2403
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:13,030
people know that that know me and you
know you just try to keep pushing and

2404
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:13,040
know you just try to keep pushing and
 

2405
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:17,200
know you just try to keep pushing and
and so forth but but yeah I think I try

2406
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:17,210
and so forth but but yeah I think I try
 

2407
00:49:17,210 --> 00:49:20,070
and so forth but but yeah I think I try
to do that as the one who leads the lab

2408
00:49:20,070 --> 00:49:20,080
to do that as the one who leads the lab
 

2409
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:22,360
to do that as the one who leads the lab
so you have this exceptionally

2410
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:22,370
so you have this exceptionally
 

2411
00:49:22,370 --> 00:49:24,550
so you have this exceptionally
successful lab and and one of the great

2412
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:24,560
successful lab and and one of the great
 

2413
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:29,020
successful lab and and one of the great
institutions in the world MIT what and

2414
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:29,030
institutions in the world MIT what and
 

2415
00:49:29,030 --> 00:49:32,230
institutions in the world MIT what and
yet sort of at least in my neck of the

2416
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:32,240
yet sort of at least in my neck of the
 

2417
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,210
yet sort of at least in my neck of the
woods in computer science and artificial

2418
00:49:34,210 --> 00:49:34,220
woods in computer science and artificial
 

2419
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:37,760
woods in computer science and artificial
intelligence a lot of the

2420
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:37,770
intelligence a lot of the
 

2421
00:49:37,770 --> 00:49:41,210
intelligence a lot of the
research is kind of a lot of the great

2422
00:49:41,210 --> 00:49:41,220
research is kind of a lot of the great
 

2423
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:43,940
research is kind of a lot of the great
researchers not everyone but some are

2424
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:43,950
researchers not everyone but some are
 

2425
00:49:43,950 --> 00:49:47,450
researchers not everyone but some are
kind of going to industry a lot of them

2426
00:49:47,450 --> 00:49:47,460
kind of going to industry a lot of them
 

2427
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:49,850
kind of going to industry a lot of them
researchers moving to industry deep what

2428
00:49:49,850 --> 00:49:49,860
researchers moving to industry deep what
 

2429
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:51,560
researchers moving to industry deep what
do you think about the future of science

2430
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:51,570
do you think about the future of science
 

2431
00:49:51,570 --> 00:49:54,500
do you think about the future of science
in general is there drawbacks is a

2432
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:54,510
in general is there drawbacks is a
 

2433
00:49:54,510 --> 00:49:57,460
in general is there drawbacks is a
strength to the academic environment

2434
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:57,470
strength to the academic environment
 

2435
00:49:57,470 --> 00:50:00,500
strength to the academic environment
that you hope will persist how does it

2436
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:00,510
that you hope will persist how does it
 

2437
00:50:00,510 --> 00:50:03,170
that you hope will persist how does it
need to change what needs to stay the

2438
00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:03,180
need to change what needs to stay the
 

2439
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:03,800
need to change what needs to stay the
same

2440
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:03,810
same
 

2441
00:50:03,810 --> 00:50:05,210
same
what are your just thoughts in this

2442
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:05,220
what are your just thoughts in this
 

2443
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:07,180
what are your just thoughts in this
whole landscape of science in its future

2444
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:07,190
whole landscape of science in its future
 

2445
00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:09,920
whole landscape of science in its future
well first I think going to industry is

2446
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:09,930
well first I think going to industry is
 

2447
00:50:09,930 --> 00:50:11,690
well first I think going to industry is
good but I think being an academia is

2448
00:50:11,690 --> 00:50:11,700
good but I think being an academia is
 

2449
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:13,940
good but I think being an academia is
good you know I have lots of students

2450
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:13,950
good you know I have lots of students
 

2451
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:16,670
good you know I have lots of students
who have done both and they've had great

2452
00:50:16,670 --> 00:50:16,680
who have done both and they've had great
 

2453
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,460
who have done both and they've had great
careers doing both I I think from an

2454
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:19,470
careers doing both I I think from an
 

2455
00:50:19,470 --> 00:50:21,830
careers doing both I I think from an
academic standpoint I mean the biggest

2456
00:50:21,830 --> 00:50:21,840
academic standpoint I mean the biggest
 

2457
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:24,070
academic standpoint I mean the biggest
concern probably that people feel today

2458
00:50:24,070 --> 00:50:24,080
concern probably that people feel today
 

2459
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:26,960
concern probably that people feel today
you know at a place like MIT or other

2460
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:26,970
you know at a place like MIT or other
 

2461
00:50:26,970 --> 00:50:29,270
you know at a place like MIT or other
research heavy institutions is going to

2462
00:50:29,270 --> 00:50:29,280
research heavy institutions is going to
 

2463
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,250
research heavy institutions is going to
be funding and particularly funding

2464
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:31,260
be funding and particularly funding
 

2465
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:34,550
be funding and particularly funding
that's not super directed you know so

2466
00:50:34,550 --> 00:50:34,560
that's not super directed you know so
 

2467
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:37,370
that's not super directed you know so
that you can do basic research I think

2468
00:50:37,370 --> 00:50:37,380
that you can do basic research I think
 

2469
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:39,500
that you can do basic research I think
that's probably the number one thing but

2470
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:39,510
that's probably the number one thing but
 

2471
00:50:39,510 --> 00:50:42,680
that's probably the number one thing but
you know it would be great if we as a

2472
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:42,690
you know it would be great if we as a
 

2473
00:50:42,690 --> 00:50:44,660
you know it would be great if we as a
society had come up with better ways to

2474
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:44,670
society had come up with better ways to
 

2475
00:50:44,670 --> 00:50:47,660
society had come up with better ways to
teach you know so that people all over

2476
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:47,670
teach you know so that people all over
 

2477
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:50,840
teach you know so that people all over
could learn better you know so I think

2478
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:50,850
could learn better you know so I think
 

2479
00:50:50,850 --> 00:50:52,070
could learn better you know so I think
there were a number of things that would

2480
00:50:52,070 --> 00:50:52,080
there were a number of things that would
 

2481
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:55,730
there were a number of things that would
be good to be able to do better so again

2482
00:50:55,730 --> 00:50:55,740
be good to be able to do better so again
 

2483
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:58,130
be good to be able to do better so again
you're very successful in terms of

2484
00:50:58,130 --> 00:50:58,140
you're very successful in terms of
 

2485
00:50:58,140 --> 00:50:59,930
you're very successful in terms of
funding but do you still feel the

2486
00:50:59,930 --> 00:50:59,940
funding but do you still feel the
 

2487
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:03,380
funding but do you still feel the
pressure of that of having to seek

2488
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:03,390
pressure of that of having to seek
 

2489
00:51:03,390 --> 00:51:06,230
pressure of that of having to seek
funding does it affect the science or is

2490
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:06,240
funding does it affect the science or is
 

2491
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:09,260
funding does it affect the science or is
it or can you simply focus on doing the

2492
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:09,270
it or can you simply focus on doing the
 

2493
00:51:09,270 --> 00:51:11,990
it or can you simply focus on doing the
best work of your life and the funding

2494
00:51:11,990 --> 00:51:12,000
best work of your life and the funding
 

2495
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,600
best work of your life and the funding
comes along with that I'd say the last

2496
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:14,610
comes along with that I'd say the last
 

2497
00:51:14,610 --> 00:51:17,320
comes along with that I'd say the last
10 or 15 years we've done pretty well

2498
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:17,330
10 or 15 years we've done pretty well
 

2499
00:51:17,330 --> 00:51:19,880
10 or 15 years we've done pretty well
funding but I always worry about it you

2500
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:19,890
funding but I always worry about it you
 

2501
00:51:19,890 --> 00:51:23,060
funding but I always worry about it you
know it's like you're still operating on

2502
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:23,070
know it's like you're still operating on
 

2503
00:51:23,070 --> 00:51:26,210
know it's like you're still operating on
more soft money than hard and and so I

2504
00:51:26,210 --> 00:51:26,220
more soft money than hard and and so I
 

2505
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:28,460
more soft money than hard and and so I
always worry about it but we've been

2506
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:28,470
always worry about it but we've been
 

2507
00:51:28,470 --> 00:51:32,300
always worry about it but we've been
fortunate that places have come to us

2508
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:32,310
fortunate that places have come to us
 

2509
00:51:32,310 --> 00:51:34,730
fortunate that places have come to us
like the Gates Foundation and others

jovan Diabetes Foundation some companies
and they're willing to give us funding

2514
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:39,510
and they're willing to give us funding

it but
 

2525
00:51:50,789 --> 00:51:52,699
it but
you know I just view that as a part of

2526

gates on the other hand I think when he

2584
00:53:04,729 --> 00:53:04,739
gates on the other hand I think when he
 

2585
00:53:04,739 --> 00:53:07,429
gates on the other hand I think when he
had got his fortune I mean he thought

2586
00:53:07,429 --> 00:53:07,439
had got his fortune I mean he thought
 

2587
00:53:07,439 --> 00:53:09,109
had got his fortune I mean he thought
about it and felt well how could he have

2588
00:53:09,109 --> 00:53:09,119
about it and felt well how could he have
 

2589
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:10,759
about it and felt well how could he have
the greatest impact and he thought about

2590
00:53:10,759 --> 00:53:10,769
the greatest impact and he thought about
 

2591
00:53:10,769 --> 00:53:12,679
the greatest impact and he thought about
you know helping people in the

2592
00:53:12,679 --> 00:53:12,689
you know helping people in the
 

2593
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:14,959
you know helping people in the
developing world and and and and

2594
00:53:14,959 --> 00:53:14,969
developing world and and and and
 

2595
00:53:14,969 --> 00:53:16,880
developing world and and and and
medicines and different things like that

2596
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:16,890
medicines and different things like that
 

2597
00:53:16,890 --> 00:53:18,679
medicines and different things like that
that like vaccines that might be really

2598
00:53:18,679 --> 00:53:18,689
that like vaccines that might be really
 

2599
00:53:18,689 --> 00:53:20,329
that like vaccines that might be really
helpful for people in the developing

2600
00:53:20,329 --> 00:53:20,339
helpful for people in the developing
 

2601
00:53:20,339 --> 00:53:23,569
helpful for people in the developing
world and and so so I think first you

2602
00:53:23,569 --> 00:53:23,579
world and and so so I think first you
 

2603
00:53:23,579 --> 00:53:26,029
world and and so so I think first you
start out with that vision once you

2604
00:53:26,029 --> 00:53:26,039
start out with that vision once you
 

2605
00:53:26,039 --> 00:53:28,579
start out with that vision once you
start out with that vision whatever

2606
00:53:28,579 --> 00:53:28,589
start out with that vision whatever
 

2607
00:53:28,589 --> 00:53:32,749
start out with that vision whatever
vision it is then I think you try to ask

2608
00:53:32,749 --> 00:53:32,759
vision it is then I think you try to ask
 

2609
00:53:32,759 --> 00:53:35,329
vision it is then I think you try to ask
the question who in the world does the

2610
00:53:35,329 --> 00:53:35,339
the question who in the world does the
 

2611
00:53:35,339 --> 00:53:38,630
the question who in the world does the
best work if that was your goal I mean

2612
00:53:38,630 --> 00:53:38,640
best work if that was your goal I mean
 

2613
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,189
best work if that was your goal I mean
but you really I think have to have a

2614
00:53:40,189 --> 00:53:40,199
but you really I think have to have a
 

2615
00:53:40,199 --> 00:53:42,349
but you really I think have to have a
defined vision vision first yeah that

2616
00:53:42,349 --> 00:53:42,359
defined vision vision first yeah that
 

2617
00:53:42,359 --> 00:53:43,969
defined vision vision first yeah that
that comes and and and I think that's

2618
00:53:43,969 --> 00:53:43,979
that comes and and and I think that's
 

2619
00:53:43,979 --> 00:53:46,009
that comes and and and I think that's
what people do I mean I have never seen

2620
00:53:46,009 --> 00:53:46,019
what people do I mean I have never seen
 

2621
00:53:46,019 --> 00:53:49,130
what people do I mean I have never seen
anybody do it otherwise I mean and and

2622
00:53:49,130 --> 00:53:49,140
anybody do it otherwise I mean and and
 

2623
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:51,829
anybody do it otherwise I mean and and
that by the way it may not be the best

2624
00:53:51,829 --> 00:53:51,839
that by the way it may not be the best
 

2625
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:54,019
that by the way it may not be the best
thing overall I mean I think I think

2626
00:53:54,019 --> 00:53:54,029
thing overall I mean I think I think
 

2627
00:53:54,029 --> 00:53:55,549
thing overall I mean I think I think
it's good that all those things happen

2628
00:53:55,549 --> 00:53:55,559
it's good that all those things happen
 

2629
00:53:55,559 --> 00:53:57,289
it's good that all those things happen
but you know what you really want to do

2630
00:53:57,289 --> 00:53:57,299
but you know what you really want to do
 

2631
00:53:57,299 --> 00:54:00,409
but you know what you really want to do
and I'll make a contrast in a second in

2632
00:54:00,409 --> 00:54:00,419
and I'll make a contrast in a second in
 

2633
00:54:00,419 --> 00:54:02,809
and I'll make a contrast in a second in
addition to funding important areas like

2634
00:54:02,809 --> 00:54:02,819
addition to funding important areas like
 

2635
00:54:02,819 --> 00:54:04,259
addition to funding important areas like
what both of those people

2636
00:54:04,259 --> 00:54:04,269
what both of those people
 

2637
00:54:04,269 --> 00:54:08,849
what both of those people
is to help young people and that they

2638
00:54:08,849 --> 00:54:08,859
is to help young people and that they
 

2639
00:54:08,859 --> 00:54:10,709
is to help young people and that they
may be at odds with each other because a

2640
00:54:10,709 --> 00:54:10,719
may be at odds with each other because a
 

2641
00:54:10,719 --> 00:54:13,679
may be at odds with each other because a
farm or a lab like ours which is you

2642
00:54:13,679 --> 00:54:13,689
farm or a lab like ours which is you
 

2643
00:54:13,689 --> 00:54:16,199
farm or a lab like ours which is you
know I'm older is you know might be very

2644
00:54:16,199 --> 00:54:16,209
know I'm older is you know might be very
 

2645
00:54:16,209 --> 00:54:18,689
know I'm older is you know might be very
good at addressing some of those kinds

2646
00:54:18,689 --> 00:54:18,699
good at addressing some of those kinds
 

2647
00:54:18,699 --> 00:54:20,519
good at addressing some of those kinds
of problems but you know I'm not young I

2648
00:54:20,519 --> 00:54:20,529
of problems but you know I'm not young I
 

2649
00:54:20,529 --> 00:54:22,079
of problems but you know I'm not young I
trained a lot of people who are young

2650
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:22,089
trained a lot of people who are young
 

2651
00:54:22,089 --> 00:54:24,089
trained a lot of people who are young
but it's not the same as helping

2652
00:54:24,089 --> 00:54:24,099
but it's not the same as helping
 

2653
00:54:24,099 --> 00:54:25,499
but it's not the same as helping
somebody who's an assistant professor

2654
00:54:25,499 --> 00:54:25,509
somebody who's an assistant professor
 

2655
00:54:25,509 --> 00:54:28,859
somebody who's an assistant professor
someplace so I think what's I think been

2656
00:54:28,859 --> 00:54:28,869
someplace so I think what's I think been
 

2657
00:54:28,869 --> 00:54:32,099
someplace so I think what's I think been
good about our thing our society or

2658
00:54:32,099 --> 00:54:32,109
good about our thing our society or
 

2659
00:54:32,109 --> 00:54:34,409
good about our thing our society or
things overall or that there are people

2660
00:54:34,409 --> 00:54:34,419
things overall or that there are people
 

2661
00:54:34,419 --> 00:54:36,139
things overall or that there are people
who come at it from different ways and

2662
00:54:36,139 --> 00:54:36,149
who come at it from different ways and
 

2663
00:54:36,149 --> 00:54:39,329
who come at it from different ways and
the combination the confluence of the

2664
00:54:39,329 --> 00:54:39,339
the combination the confluence of the
 

2665
00:54:39,339 --> 00:54:41,639
the combination the confluence of the
government funding the certain

2666
00:54:41,639 --> 00:54:41,649
government funding the certain
 

2667
00:54:41,649 --> 00:54:44,009
government funding the certain
foundations that that fund things and

2668
00:54:44,009 --> 00:54:44,019
foundations that that fund things and
 

2669
00:54:44,019 --> 00:54:46,889
foundations that that fund things and
other foundations that you don't want to

2670
00:54:46,889 --> 00:54:46,899
other foundations that you don't want to
 

2671
00:54:46,899 --> 00:54:50,429
other foundations that you don't want to
see disease treated well then they can

2672
00:54:50,429 --> 00:54:50,439
see disease treated well then they can
 

2673
00:54:50,439 --> 00:54:52,109
see disease treated well then they can
go seek out people or they can put a

2674
00:54:52,109 --> 00:54:52,119
go seek out people or they can put a
 

2675
00:54:52,119 --> 00:54:53,819
go seek out people or they can put a
request for proposals and see who does

2676
00:54:53,819 --> 00:54:53,829
request for proposals and see who does
 

2677
00:54:53,829 --> 00:54:56,519
request for proposals and see who does
the best you know I'd say both David

2678
00:54:56,519 --> 00:54:56,529
the best you know I'd say both David
 

2679
00:54:56,529 --> 00:54:58,859
the best you know I'd say both David
Koch and Bill Gates did exactly that

2680
00:54:58,859 --> 00:54:58,869
Koch and Bill Gates did exactly that
 

2681
00:54:58,869 --> 00:55:01,619
Koch and Bill Gates did exactly that
they sought out people most of them you

2682
00:55:01,619 --> 00:55:01,629
they sought out people most of them you
 

2683
00:55:01,629 --> 00:55:03,179
they sought out people most of them you
know or what are their foundations that

2684
00:55:03,179 --> 00:55:03,189
know or what are their foundations that
 

2685
00:55:03,189 --> 00:55:04,889
know or what are their foundations that
they were involved in so I doubt people

2686
00:55:04,889 --> 00:55:04,899
they were involved in so I doubt people
 

2687
00:55:04,899 --> 00:55:09,269
they were involved in so I doubt people
like myself but they also had requests

2688
00:55:09,269 --> 00:55:09,279
like myself but they also had requests
 

2689
00:55:09,279 --> 00:55:10,459
like myself but they also had requests
for proposals

2690
00:55:10,459 --> 00:55:10,469
for proposals
 

2691
00:55:10,469 --> 00:55:12,899
for proposals
now you mentioned young people and that

2692
00:55:12,899 --> 00:55:12,909
now you mentioned young people and that
 

2693
00:55:12,909 --> 00:55:14,639
now you mentioned young people and that
reminds me something he said in an

2694
00:55:14,639 --> 00:55:14,649
reminds me something he said in an
 

2695
00:55:14,649 --> 00:55:18,269
reminds me something he said in an
interview of written somewhere that said

2696
00:55:18,269 --> 00:55:18,279
interview of written somewhere that said
 

2697
00:55:18,279 --> 00:55:21,359
interview of written somewhere that said
you're some of your initial struggles in

2698
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:21,369
you're some of your initial struggles in
 

2699
00:55:21,369 --> 00:55:25,139
you're some of your initial struggles in
that terms of finding a faculty position

2700
00:55:25,139 --> 00:55:25,149
that terms of finding a faculty position
 

2701
00:55:25,149 --> 00:55:30,059
that terms of finding a faculty position
or so on they eat in quite for people

2702
00:55:30,059 --> 00:55:30,069
or so on they eat in quite for people
 

2703
00:55:30,069 --> 00:55:32,099
or so on they eat in quite for people
fit into a particular bucket a

2704
00:55:32,099 --> 00:55:32,109
fit into a particular bucket a
 

2705
00:55:32,109 --> 00:55:37,519
fit into a particular bucket a
particular right can you speak to that

2706
00:55:37,519 --> 00:55:37,529
particular right can you speak to that
 

2707
00:55:37,529 --> 00:55:40,709
particular right can you speak to that
how do you see limitations to the

2708
00:55:40,709 --> 00:55:40,719
how do you see limitations to the
 

2709
00:55:40,719 --> 00:55:42,869
how do you see limitations to the
academic system that it does have such

2710
00:55:42,869 --> 00:55:42,879
academic system that it does have such
 

2711
00:55:42,879 --> 00:55:47,669
academic system that it does have such
buckets there's is there how can we

2712
00:55:47,669 --> 00:55:47,679
buckets there's is there how can we
 

2713
00:55:47,679 --> 00:55:54,269
buckets there's is there how can we
allow for people who are brilliant but

2714
00:55:54,269 --> 00:55:54,279
allow for people who are brilliant but
 

2715
00:55:54,279 --> 00:55:58,169
allow for people who are brilliant but
outside the disciplines of the previous

2716
00:55:58,169 --> 00:55:58,179
outside the disciplines of the previous
 

2717
00:55:58,179 --> 00:56:00,719
outside the disciplines of the previous
decade yeah well I think that's a great

2718
00:56:00,719 --> 00:56:00,729
decade yeah well I think that's a great
 

2719
00:56:00,729 --> 00:56:02,879
decade yeah well I think that's a great
question I think that I think the

2720
00:56:02,879 --> 00:56:02,889
question I think that I think the
 

2721
00:56:02,889 --> 00:56:04,739
question I think that I think the
department has have to have a vision you

2722
00:56:04,739 --> 00:56:04,749
department has have to have a vision you
 

2723
00:56:04,749 --> 00:56:08,239
department has have to have a vision you
know and some of them do every so often

2724
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:08,249
know and some of them do every so often
 

2725
00:56:08,249 --> 00:56:11,879
know and some of them do every so often
you know there are Institute's or labs

2726
00:56:11,879 --> 00:56:11,889
you know there are Institute's or labs
 

2727
00:56:11,889 --> 00:56:15,559
you know there are Institute's or labs
that do that I mean at MIT I think

2728
00:56:15,559 --> 00:56:15,569
that do that I mean at MIT I think
 

2729
00:56:15,569 --> 00:56:18,480
that do that I mean at MIT I think
that's done sometimes I know

2730
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:18,490
that's done sometimes I know
 

2731
00:56:18,490 --> 00:56:20,730
that's done sometimes I know
annika engineering department just had a

2732
00:56:20,730 --> 00:56:20,740
annika engineering department just had a
 

2733
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:24,030
annika engineering department just had a
search and they hired geo Traverso who

2734
00:56:24,030 --> 00:56:24,040
search and they hired geo Traverso who
 

2735
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:26,490
search and they hired geo Traverso who
was one of my he was a fellow with me

2736
00:56:26,490 --> 00:56:26,500
was one of my he was a fellow with me
 

2737
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:28,500
was one of my he was a fellow with me
and but he's he's actually a molecular

2738
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:28,510
and but he's he's actually a molecular
 

2739
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:30,800
and but he's he's actually a molecular
biologist Anna and and a

2740
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:30,810
biologist Anna and and a
 

2741
00:56:30,810 --> 00:56:33,240
biologist Anna and and a
gastroenterologist and you know he's one

2742
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:33,250
gastroenterologist and you know he's one
 

2743
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:35,370
gastroenterologist and you know he's one
of the best in the world but they but

2744
00:56:35,370 --> 00:56:35,380
of the best in the world but they but
 

2745
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:36,810
of the best in the world but they but
he's also done some great mechanical

2746
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:36,820
he's also done some great mechanical
 

2747
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:38,280
he's also done some great mechanical
engineering and designing some new pills

2748
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:38,290
engineering and designing some new pills
 

2749
00:56:38,290 --> 00:56:41,520
engineering and designing some new pills
and things like that and they picked a

2750
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:41,530
and things like that and they picked a
 

2751
00:56:41,530 --> 00:56:43,950
and things like that and they picked a
man boy I give them a lot of credit I

2752
00:56:43,950 --> 00:56:43,960
man boy I give them a lot of credit I
 

2753
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:46,320
man boy I give them a lot of credit I
mean that's that's that's vision to pick

2754
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:46,330
mean that's that's that's vision to pick
 

2755
00:56:46,330 --> 00:56:48,570
mean that's that's that's vision to pick
somebody and I think you know they'll be

2756
00:56:48,570 --> 00:56:48,580
somebody and I think you know they'll be
 

2757
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:50,940
somebody and I think you know they'll be
the richer for I think the Media Lab is

2758
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:50,950
the richer for I think the Media Lab is
 

2759
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:52,800
the richer for I think the Media Lab is
certainly hired you know people I get

2760
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:52,810
certainly hired you know people I get
 

2761
00:56:52,810 --> 00:56:55,680
certainly hired you know people I get
Boyden and others who depth on you know

2762
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:55,690
Boyden and others who depth on you know
 

2763
00:56:55,690 --> 00:56:57,480
Boyden and others who depth on you know
very different things and so I think

2764
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:57,490
very different things and so I think
 

2765
00:56:57,490 --> 00:57:00,000
very different things and so I think
that you know is that that that's part

2766
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:00,010
that you know is that that that's part
 

2767
00:57:00,010 --> 00:57:01,920
that you know is that that that's part
of the vision of the leadership who who

2768
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:01,930
of the vision of the leadership who who
 

2769
00:57:01,930 --> 00:57:04,190
of the vision of the leadership who who
do things like that do you think one day

2770
00:57:04,190 --> 00:57:04,200
do things like that do you think one day
 

2771
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:07,440
do things like that do you think one day
you mentioned David Koch and cancer do

2772
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:07,450
you mentioned David Koch and cancer do
 

2773
00:57:07,450 --> 00:57:10,650
you mentioned David Koch and cancer do
you think one day will cure cancer yeah

2774
00:57:10,650 --> 00:57:10,660
you think one day will cure cancer yeah
 

2775
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:12,420
you think one day will cure cancer yeah
I do I mean I coached one day I don't

2776
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:12,430
I do I mean I coached one day I don't
 

2777
00:57:12,430 --> 00:57:14,100
I do I mean I coached one day I don't
know how long that they will come soon

2778
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:14,110
know how long that they will come soon
 

2779
00:57:14,110 --> 00:57:17,250
know how long that they will come soon
but yeah so soon no but I mean I think

2780
00:57:17,250 --> 00:57:17,260
but yeah so soon no but I mean I think
 

2781
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:19,140
but yeah so soon no but I mean I think
do you think it is a grand challenge it

2782
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:19,150
do you think it is a grand challenge it
 

2783
00:57:19,150 --> 00:57:20,880
do you think it is a grand challenge it
is a grand challenges it's not just

2784
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:20,890
is a grand challenges it's not just
 

2785
00:57:20,890 --> 00:57:23,070
is a grand challenges it's not just
solvable within a few years not so I

2786
00:57:23,070 --> 00:57:23,080
solvable within a few years not so I
 

2787
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:24,540
solvable within a few years not so I
don't think very many things are

2788
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:24,550
don't think very many things are
 

2789
00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:26,250
don't think very many things are
solvable in a few years there's some

2790
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:26,260
solvable in a few years there's some
 

2791
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:27,750
solvable in a few years there's some
good ideas that people are working on

2792
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:27,760
good ideas that people are working on
 

2793
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:30,270
good ideas that people are working on
but I mean all cancers that's that's

2794
00:57:30,270 --> 00:57:30,280
but I mean all cancers that's that's
 

2795
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:33,780
but I mean all cancers that's that's
pretty tough if we do get the cure what

2796
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:33,790
pretty tough if we do get the cure what
 

2797
00:57:33,790 --> 00:57:35,220
pretty tough if we do get the cure what
will the Cure look like do you think

2798
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:35,230
will the Cure look like do you think
 

2799
00:57:35,230 --> 00:57:38,460
will the Cure look like do you think
which mechanisms which disciplines will

2800
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:38,470
which mechanisms which disciplines will
 

2801
00:57:38,470 --> 00:57:40,890
which mechanisms which disciplines will
help us arrive at that cure from all the

2802
00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:40,900
help us arrive at that cure from all the
 

2803
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:43,440
help us arrive at that cure from all the
amazing work you've done as touched on

2804
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:43,450
amazing work you've done as touched on
 

2805
00:57:43,450 --> 00:57:45,180
amazing work you've done as touched on
cancer no I think it'll be a combination

2806
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:45,190
cancer no I think it'll be a combination
 

2807
00:57:45,190 --> 00:57:47,340
cancer no I think it'll be a combination
of biology and engineering I think it'll

2808
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:47,350
of biology and engineering I think it'll
 

2809
00:57:47,350 --> 00:57:50,730
of biology and engineering I think it'll
be biology to understand the right

2810
00:57:50,730 --> 00:57:50,740

and and trying to use engineering and in
 

2891
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:33,840
and and trying to use engineering and in
new ways and so I think that's just an
