the big part of this thinking at the

416
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:54,720
the big part of this thinking at the
 

417
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,749
the big part of this thinking at the
time this is again the late 19th century

418
00:07:56,749 --> 00:07:56,759
time this is again the late 19th century
 

419
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:59,029
time this is again the late 19th century
is the idea that there's going to be a

420
00:07:59,029 --> 00:07:59,039
is the idea that there's going to be a
 

421
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,189
is the idea that there's going to be a
worldwide workers Revolution it wasn't

00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:01,199
worldwide workers Revolution it wasn't
 

423

worldwide workers Revolution it wasn't
going to be that you know in one country

424
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:03,180
going to be that you know in one country
 

425
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,089
going to be that you know in one country
you know it was going to happen and then

426
00:08:05,089 --> 00:08:05,099
you know it was going to happen and then
 

427
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:06,350
you know it was going to happen and then
all the other countries be capitalists

428
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:06,360
all the other countries be capitalists
 

429
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,990
all the other countries be capitalists
the idea was all right uh like the

430
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:09,000
the idea was all right uh like the
 

431
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,270
the idea was all right uh like the
workers in Germany have more income with

432
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:11,280
workers in Germany have more income with
 

433
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,610
workers in Germany have more income with
the workers in America then the workers

434
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:13,620
the workers in America then the workers
 

435
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,170
the workers in America then the workers
in Germany have with the capitalists in

00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:15,180
in Germany have with the capitalists in
 

437
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,790
in Germany have with the capitalists in
Germany so the idea is all right like

438
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:16,800
Germany so the idea is all right like
 

439
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,710
Germany so the idea is all right like
the working class all over the world at

440
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:18,720
the working class all over the world at
 

441
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,330
the working class all over the world at
one point they're going to be like we're

442
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:20,340
one point they're going to be like we're
 

443
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,550
one point they're going to be like we're
being exploited uh it's getting worse

444
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:22,560
being exploited uh it's getting worse
 

445
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,869
being exploited uh it's getting worse
and worse for us we can't feed our

446
00:08:23,869 --> 00:08:23,879
and worse for us we can't feed our
 

447
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,850
and worse for us we can't feed our
families uh we're getting injured and so

448
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:25,860
families uh we're getting injured and so
 

449
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,050
families uh we're getting injured and so
on and so forth and there's no

450
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:27,060
on and so forth and there's no
 

451
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,969
on and so forth and there's no
compensation for this we're just going

452
00:08:28,969 --> 00:08:28,979
compensation for this we're just going
 

453
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:30,350
compensation for this we're just going
to overthrow our chains and we're going

454
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:30,360
to overthrow our chains and we're going
 

455
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,969
to overthrow our chains and we're going
to run everything ourselves we're the

456
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:31,979
to run everything ourselves we're the
 

457
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:34,130

463
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,550
the work and we're doing all the work so
why why shouldn't we be getting all the

00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:40,560
why why shouldn't we be getting all the
 

465
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,389
why why shouldn't we be getting all the

this
so this was a big source of contention

so this was a big source of contention
 

473
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,110
so this was a big source of contention
so the fabians for example in Britain

so the fabians for example in Britain
 

475
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,790
so the fabians for example in Britain
who are all socialists they were very

795
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:45,829
and if you keep talking like this
uh a five is a real possibility all

796
00:14:45,829 --> 00:14:45,839
uh a five is a real possibility all
 

797
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,590
uh a five is a real possibility all
right so uh vacuum is the kind of vacuum

798
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:48,600
right so uh vacuum is the kind of vacuum
 

799
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,329
right so uh vacuum is the kind of vacuum
that's created with violence is is

800
00:14:50,329 --> 00:14:50,339
that's created with violence is is
 

801
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:52,189
that's created with violence is is
usually

802
00:14:52,189 --> 00:14:52,199
usually
 

803
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:55,250
usually
um filled with like a with a harsh with

804
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:55,260
um filled with like a with a harsh with
 

805
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,769
um filled with like a with a harsh with
a harsher figure so so you don't think

806
00:14:57,769 --> 00:14:57,779
a harsher figure so so you don't think
 

807
00:14:57,779 --> 00:15:00,170
a harsher figure so so you don't think
violent revolution ultimately leads to a

808
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:00,180
violent revolution ultimately leads to a
 

809
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:02,329
violent revolution ultimately leads to a
positive Pro positive progress in the

810
00:15:02,329 --> 00:15:02,339
positive Pro positive progress in the
 

811
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:03,650
positive Pro positive progress in the
short term well sometimes it does the

812
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:03,660
short term well sometimes it does the
 

813
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,389
short term well sometimes it does the
American Revolution I think was a

814
00:15:05,389 --> 00:15:05,399
American Revolution I think was a
 

815
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:07,550
American Revolution I think was a
positive example and overthrowing the

816
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:07,560
positive example and overthrowing the
 

817
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,310
positive example and overthrowing the
Czar which was done peacefully uh was a

818
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:10,320
Czar which was done peacefully uh was a
 

819
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,949
Czar which was done peacefully uh was a
positive example but again uh when

820
00:15:12,949 --> 00:15:12,959
positive example but again uh when
 

821
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,949
positive example but again uh when
violence happens people get scared and

822
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:15,959
violence happens people get scared and
 

823
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:17,150
violence happens people get scared and
they want the violence stopped

824
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:17,160
they want the violence stopped
 

825
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,650
they want the violence stopped
immediately and that's a call for

826
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:18,660
immediately and that's a call for
 

827
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,930
immediately and that's a call for
authoritarianism and you see it time and

828
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:20,940
authoritarianism and you see it time and
 

829
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,790
authoritarianism and you see it time and
time again and and they also want

830
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:22,800
time again and and they also want
 

831
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,990
time again and and they also want
retribution they were like bring this

832
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:24,000
retribution they were like bring this
 

833
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,210
retribution they were like bring this
back to normal uh and they don't really

834
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:26,220
back to normal uh and they don't really
 

835
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,650
back to normal uh and they don't really
worry about things like civil liberties

836
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:27,660
worry about things like civil liberties
 

837
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,350
worry about things like civil liberties
or things like that it's it's a very uh

838
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:30,360
or things like that it's it's a very uh
 

839
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,230
or things like that it's it's a very uh
uh and then it also creates this space

840
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:33,240
uh and then it also creates this space
 

841
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,930
uh and then it also creates this space
for Invasion from foreign sources or

842
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:35,940
for Invasion from foreign sources or
 

843
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,850

00:15:44,689 --> 00:15:44,699
deadly game obviously I remember
 

851
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:46,850
deadly game obviously I remember
somebody told me

852
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:46,860
somebody told me
 

853
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,550
somebody told me
that uh I forget where it was but they

854
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:49,560
that uh I forget where it was but they
 

855
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,470
that uh I forget where it was but they
told me that from the very beginning was

856
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:51,480
told me that from the very beginning was
 

857
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,990
told me that from the very beginning was
obvious that communism is an evil system

858
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:54,000
obvious that communism is an evil system
 

859
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,389
obvious that communism is an evil system
that would or a system that leads to

860
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:56,399
that would or a system that leads to
 

861
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:57,410
that would or a system that leads to
evil

862
00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:57,420
evil
 

863
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,870
evil
and uh to me at least that's not if I

864
00:15:59,870 --> 00:15:59,880
and uh to me at least that's not if I
 

865
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,250
and uh to me at least that's not if I
had to put put myself in the beginning

866
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:01,260
had to put put myself in the beginning
 

867
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,870
had to put put myself in the beginning
of the 20th century at the end of the

868
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:02,880
of the 20th century at the end of the
 

869
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,150
of the 20th century at the end of the
19th century that's totally not obvious

870
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:05,160
19th century that's totally not obvious
 

871
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,829
19th century that's totally not obvious
they are

872
00:16:06,829 --> 00:16:06,839
they are
 

873
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,949
they are
trying to elevate Humanity the the basic

874
00:16:09,949 --> 00:16:09,959
trying to elevate Humanity the the basic
 

875
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:12,470
trying to elevate Humanity the the basic
worth of a human being of a hard-working

876
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:12,480
worth of a human being of a hard-working
 

877
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,030
worth of a human being of a hard-working
human being of the working class of the

878
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:14,040
human being of the working class of the
 

879
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,290
human being of the working class of the
people that are doing the work and the

880
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:15,300
people that are doing the work and the
 

881
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,170
people that are doing the work and the
striving and just uh really trying to

882
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:18,180
striving and just uh really trying to
 

883
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,030
striving and just uh really trying to
build up Society with their own hands

884
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:20,040
build up Society with their own hands
 

885
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,370
build up Society with their own hands
and she seems like a beautiful ideal uh

886
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:22,380
and she seems like a beautiful ideal uh
 

887
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,470
and she seems like a beautiful ideal uh
so I guess the question is

888
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:24,480
so I guess the question is
 

889
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,050
so I guess the question is
can you see yourself believing in that

890
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:27,060
can you see yourself believing in that
 

891
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,210
can you see yourself believing in that
in in the ideas of socialism and

892
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:29,220
in in the ideas of socialism and
 

893
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,129
in in the ideas of socialism and
communism yeah let's say if you were

894
00:16:31,129 --> 00:16:31,139
communism yeah let's say if you were
 

895
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:33,710
communism yeah let's say if you were
living in Russia oh yeah easily so first

896
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:33,720
living in Russia oh yeah easily so first
 

897
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,030
living in Russia oh yeah easily so first
of all I I don't think anything is

898
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:35,040
of all I I don't think anything is
 

899
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,030
of all I I don't think anything is
obvious in politics uh it's not obvious

900
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:38,040
obvious in politics uh it's not obvious
 

901
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,269
obvious in politics uh it's not obvious
that you know uh humans have rights it's

902
00:16:41,269 --> 00:16:41,279
that you know uh humans have rights it's
 

903
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:42,949
that you know uh humans have rights it's
not obvious that Liberty is better or

904
00:16:42,949 --> 00:16:42,959
not obvious that Liberty is better or
 

905
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,870
not obvious that Liberty is better or
the Market's either either whether

906
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:44,880
the Market's either either whether
 

907
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,090
the Market's either either whether
you're for you know a welfare state or

908
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:47,100
you're for you know a welfare state or
 

909
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,829
you're for you know a welfare state or
you're for more free markets not that

910
00:16:48,829 --> 00:16:48,839
you're for more free markets not that
 

911
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:50,629
you're for more free markets not that
those is obvious both of them involve an

912
00:16:50,629 --> 00:16:50,639
those is obvious both of them involve an
 

913
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,550
those is obvious both of them involve an
enormous amount of thought and

914
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:52,560
enormous amount of thought and
 

915
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,110
enormous amount of thought and
background information so when someone

916
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:54,120
background information so when someone
 

917
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,629
background information so when someone
says something is obvious in politics

918
00:16:56,629 --> 00:16:56,639
says something is obvious in politics
 

919
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,009
says something is obvious in politics
they really mean something is apparent

920
00:16:58,009 --> 00:16:58,019
they really mean something is apparent
 

921
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:00,350
they really mean something is apparent
well it's not a parent on its face that

922
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:00,360
well it's not a parent on its face that
 

923
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,689
well it's not a parent on its face that
if we all get together and promote a

924
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:02,699
if we all get together and promote a
 

925
00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:05,449
if we all get together and promote a
society based on equality and we all

926
00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:05,459
society based on equality and we all
 

927
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:08,329
society based on equality and we all
chip in that it's gonna really be good

928
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:08,339
chip in that it's gonna really be good
 

929
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:10,970
chip in that it's gonna really be good
for everyone I mean that to me is the

930
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:10,980
for everyone I mean that to me is the
 

931
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,549
for everyone I mean that to me is the
promise of Communism

932
00:17:13,549 --> 00:17:13,559
promise of Communism
 

933
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:16,730
promise of Communism
um and it was also very appealing to

934
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:16,740
um and it was also very appealing to
 

935
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,490
um and it was also very appealing to
many people because it was new

936
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:19,500
many people because it was new
 

937
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,429
many people because it was new
so the idea was all right we've tried it

938
00:17:22,429 --> 00:17:22,439
so the idea was all right we've tried it
 

939
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:24,289
so the idea was all right we've tried it
these other ways there's all these

940
00:17:24,289 --> 00:17:24,299
these other ways there's all these
 

941
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:26,090
these other ways there's all these
negative consequences you have all these

942
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:26,100
negative consequences you have all these
 

943
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,370
negative consequences you have all these
slums you have people getting you know

slums you have people getting you know

fired and then they have no recourse you
 

947
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,650
fired and then they have no recourse you
have women with 10 kids and they can't

they're going to fall between the cracks
 

1113
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:34,430
they're going to fall between the cracks
and they're screwed under socialism if

1114
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:34,440
and they're screwed under socialism if
 

1115
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,409
and they're screwed under socialism if
you have a government taking care of

1116
00:20:36,409 --> 00:20:36,419
you have a government taking care of
 

1117
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:39,590
you have a government taking care of
everything no one is Left Behind you are

1118

everything no one is Left Behind you are
 

1119
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,409
everything no one is Left Behind you are
guaranteed that the lowest of the low

1120
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:42,419
guaranteed that the lowest of the low
 

1121
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:44,570
guaranteed that the lowest of the low
and the worst of the worst are still

1122
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:44,580
and the worst of the worst are still

starving the street or uh just left
 

1127
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:52,430
starving the street or uh just left
behind so that is a big moral case to be

1128
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:52,440
behind so that is a big moral case to be
 

1129
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,529
behind so that is a big moral case to be
made for having the state running

1130
00:20:54,529 --> 00:20:54,539
made for having the state running

everything in terms of economics it's a
 

1133
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:59,630
everything in terms of economics it's a
lot harder but the argument there would

1134
00:20:59,630 --> 00:20:59,640
lot harder but the argument there would
 

1135
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,350
lot harder but the argument there would
be it's why it's it's not fair a term

1136
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:03,360
be it's why it's it's not fair a term
 

1137
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,270
be it's why it's it's not fair a term
which in my view does not actually have

00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:05,280
which in my view does not actually have
 

1139
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,310
which in my view does not actually have
a good meaning but it's not fair that

1140
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:07,320
a good meaning but it's not fair that
 

1141
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:10,669
a good meaning but it's not fair that

why so
um that is another strong argument to be

1160
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:29,940
um that is another strong argument to be
 

1161
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,330
um that is another strong argument to be
made for socialism and the other

1162
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:32,340
made for socialism and the other
 

1163
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:36,169
made for socialism and the other
argument is if you have a media

1164
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:36,179

00:22:04,789 --> 00:22:04,799
that's the argument what about the
 

1189
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,510

of anarchism it kind of has the same
 

1195
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:16,610
of anarchism it kind of has the same
conclusion which is reaching towards the

1196
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:16,620
conclusion which is reaching towards the
 

1197
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,830
conclusion which is reaching towards the
removal of the state to where we I guess

1198
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:18,840
removal of the state to where we I guess
 

1199
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,669
removal of the state to where we I guess
have

1200
00:22:19,669 --> 00:22:19,679
have
 

1201
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,190
have
uh some distributed reallocation of

the nature of man himself was going to
 

1229
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:57,590
the nature of man himself was going to
change changed and then the government

1230
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:57,600
change changed and then the government
 

1231
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,630

we reached full communism the other goes

1252
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:23,880
we reached full communism the other goes

worse so you know that's kind of the

1256
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:27,780
worse so you know that's kind of the
 

1257
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,570
worse so you know that's kind of the
counter argument to that

1258
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:29,580
counter argument to that
 

1259
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,190
counter argument to that
do you think

1260
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:31,200

man no
 

1265
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,450
man no
so no matter you don't think this idea

1266
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:38,460
so no matter you don't think this idea
 

1267
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,850
so no matter you don't think this idea
that uh for example America has been

1268
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:40,860
that uh for example America has been
 

1269
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,529
that uh for example America has been
founded on that all men are created to

1270
00:23:42,529 --> 00:23:42,539
founded on that all men are created to
 

1271
00:23:42,539 --> 00:23:43,549
founded on that all men are created to
equal

1272
00:23:43,549 --> 00:23:43,559
equal
 

1273
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:46,970
equal
that that idea can't permeate the

1274
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:46,980
that that idea can't permeate the
 

1275
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:50,330
that that idea can't permeate the
culture and in thereby change how we see

1276
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:50,340
culture and in thereby change how we see
 

1277
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,430
culture and in thereby change how we see
each other how we

1278
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:52,440
each other how we
 

1279
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,049
each other how we
think of the basic worth of a human

1280
00:23:54,049 --> 00:23:54,059
think of the basic worth of a human
 

1281
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:55,850
think of the basic worth of a human
being and thereby change our nature it

1282
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:55,860
being and thereby change our nature it
 

1283
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,529
being and thereby change our nature it
doesn't change that's epigenetic I don't

1284
00:23:57,529 --> 00:23:57,539
doesn't change that's epigenetic I don't
 

1285
00:23:57,539 --> 00:24:00,049
doesn't change that's epigenetic I don't
think that that changes the nature of

1286
00:24:00,049 --> 00:24:00,059
think that that changes the nature of
 

1287
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:02,870
think that that changes the nature of
man I think for example if I say someone

1288
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:02,880
man I think for example if I say someone
 

1289
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,730
man I think for example if I say someone
which I agree with that if someone is

1290
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:04,740
which I agree with that if someone is
 

1291
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,529
which I agree with that if someone is
innocent so proven guilty they're not

1292
00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:06,539
innocent so proven guilty they're not
 

1293
00:24:06,539 --> 00:24:08,690
innocent so proven guilty they're not
literally innocent they're regarded in a

1294
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:08,700
literally innocent they're regarded in a
 

1295
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,310
literally innocent they're regarded in a
legal context as innocent but that

1296
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:10,320
legal context as innocent but that
 

1297
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,230
legal context as innocent but that
person is or is not a murderer or thief

1298
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:12,240
person is or is not a murderer or thief
 

1299
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,110
person is or is not a murderer or thief
or so on and so forth so we can

1300
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:15,120
or so on and so forth so we can
 

1301
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,649
or so on and so forth so we can
legally and ethically regard everyone as

1302
00:24:18,649 --> 00:24:18,659
legally and ethically regard everyone as
 

1303
00:24:18,659 --> 00:24:21,169
legally and ethically regard everyone as
equal but as Thomas sull pointed out a

1304
00:24:21,169 --> 00:24:21,179
equal but as Thomas sull pointed out a
 

1305
00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:22,549
equal but as Thomas sull pointed out a
human being isn't even equal to himself

1306
00:24:22,549 --> 00:24:22,559
human being isn't even equal to himself
 

1307
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,649
human being isn't even equal to himself
over the course of a day twins who are

1308
00:24:24,649 --> 00:24:24,659
over the course of a day twins who are
 

1309

genetic clones are not equal to one

1310
00:24:26,149 --> 00:24:26,159
genetic clones are not equal to one
 

1311
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,570
genetic clones are not equal to one
another so it is a important thing

1312
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:29,580
another so it is a important thing
 

1313
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:32,450
another so it is a important thing
legally and it's a good yardstick but

1314
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:32,460
legally and it's a good yardstick but
 

1315
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,669
legally and it's a good yardstick but
it's not literally true but don't you

1316
00:24:34,669 --> 00:24:34,679
it's not literally true but don't you
 

1317
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:37,909
it's not literally true but don't you
think that law becomes ethics so we

1318
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:37,919
think that law becomes ethics so we
 

1319
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:38,630
think that law becomes ethics so we
um

1320
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:38,640
um
 

1321
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,870
um
we that like idea of Justice starts to

1322
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:41,880
we that like idea of Justice starts to
 

1323
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,630
we that like idea of Justice starts to
like we start to internalize it that we

1324
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:44,640
like we start to internalize it that we
 

1325
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,350
like we start to internalize it that we
just

1326
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:45,360
just
 

1327
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,330
just
the way we behave the way we think about

1328
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:47,340
the way we behave the way we think about
 

1329
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:50,029
the way we behave the way we think about
the world no I I I think it's a complete

00:24:58,799 --> 00:24:59,450
a red herring okay see what I did there
um

1336
00:24:59,450 --> 00:24:59,460
um
 

1337
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,190
um
because

1338
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:01,200
because
 

1339
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,110
because
someone is people are still going to

1340
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:03,120
someone is people are still going to
 

1341

terms of you're going to have equality
that means it's going to not matter to

1348
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:10,860
that means it's going to not matter to
 

1349
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,830
that means it's going to not matter to
you whether someone is your mom or

1355
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:19,010
street and I don't see how that will
ever become the case do you think it

1356
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:19,020
ever become the case do you think it
 

1357
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:21,350
ever become the case do you think it
would be possible if you were an

1358
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:21,360
would be possible if you were an
 

1359
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,990
would be possible if you were an

uh like you are at the beginning of the
20th century would you be able to

1364
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:26,460
20th century would you be able to
 

1365
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:29,510
20th century would you be able to
predict the rest of the 20th century no

1366
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:29,520
predict the rest of the 20th century no
 

1367
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,789

00:25:31,789 --> 00:25:31,799
I I don't think at all I think there
 

1369
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:33,890
I I don't think at all I think there
were so many

1370

were so many
 

1371
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:34,610
were so many
um

1372
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:34,620
um
 

1373
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:37,310

out of nowhere turns that no one would
 

1375

an example
 

1379
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,210
an example
um Lenin seizing power and making the

fact that he pulled it off is close to
 

1387
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,930

1499
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:48,710
retrospect there were certain things
that were predictable but it was not at

1500
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:48,720
that were predictable but it was not at
 

1501
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,390
that were predictable but it was not at
all the case that it needed to last as

1502
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:50,400
all the case that it needed to last as
 

1503
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,789
all the case that it needed to last as
long as it did in the states as FDR made

1504
00:27:52,789 --> 00:27:52,799
long as it did in the states as FDR made

something which is dark and and the

00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:34,560
background is Despair and that very
 

2079
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,910
background is Despair and that very
subtly sends a very to me pernicious

2080
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:37,920

for some something like that so that
sort of thing I think happens all the

2758
00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:04,440
sort of thing I think happens all the
 

2759
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:05,690
sort of thing I think happens all the
time there's the line I have in the book

Upton Sinclair uh I forgot how he he

2762
00:51:08,510 --> 00:51:08,520
Upton Sinclair uh I forgot how he he
 

2763
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:10,609
Upton Sinclair uh I forgot how he he
worked exactly but it's very hard to

2764
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:10,619
worked exactly but it's very hard to
 

2765
00:51:10,619 --> 00:51:11,990
worked exactly but it's very hard to
convince someone of something if his

2766
00:51:11,990 --> 00:51:12,000
convince someone of something if his
 

2767
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,549
convince someone of something if his
payroll depends on him not being

2768
00:51:13,549 --> 00:51:13,559
payroll depends on him not being
 

2769
00:51:13,559 --> 00:51:15,589
payroll depends on him not being
convinced of it right so I think things

00:51:15,589 --> 00:51:15,599
convinced of it right so I think things
 

2771
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:17,750

2779
00:51:25,859 --> 00:51:27,589
about this is to have the context now so
you'll have a politician making a claim

00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:46,549
started in 2002 like things like that so
when people are manipulating things to

2796
00:51:46,549 --> 00:51:46,559
when people are manipulating things to
 

2797
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:47,930
when people are manipulating things to
force an outcome that they want and to

because he's like all right we know

2876
00:53:19,849 --> 00:53:19,859
because he's like all right we know
 

2877
00:53:19,859 --> 00:53:21,950
because he's like all right we know
where we got to get to but we have to go

2878
00:53:21,950 --> 00:53:21,960
where we got to get to but we have to go
 

2879
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:23,390
where we got to get to but we have to go
at a certain pace and we have to adjust

2880
00:53:23,390 --> 00:53:23,400
at a certain pace and we have to adjust
 

2881
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,970
at a certain pace and we have to adjust
as we go along so to have someone who is

2882
00:53:25,970 --> 00:53:25,980
as we go along so to have someone who is
 

2883
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:28,309
as we go along so to have someone who is
that much of an ideologue and that much

2884
00:53:28,309 --> 00:53:28,319
that much of an ideologue and that much
 

2885
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:31,130
that much of an ideologue and that much
of a Visionary but still to have any

00:53:31,130 --> 00:53:31,140
of a Visionary but still to have any
 

2887
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:34,910
of a Visionary but still to have any
element of pragmatism to him is I think

2888
00:53:34,910 --> 00:53:34,920
element of pragmatism to him is I think
 

2889
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:38,089
element of pragmatism to him is I think
a very rare uh uh combination and that

2890
00:53:38,089 --> 00:53:38,099
a very rare uh uh combination and that
 

2891
00:53:38,099 --> 00:53:39,349
a very rare uh uh combination and that
pragmatism do you think that's

2892
00:53:39,349 --> 00:53:39,359
pragmatism do you think that's
 

2893
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:41,450
pragmatism do you think that's
ultimately where things go wrong sort of

2894
00:53:41,450 --> 00:53:41,460
ultimately where things go wrong sort of
 

2895
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:42,829
ultimately where things go wrong sort of
uh

2896
00:53:42,829 --> 00:53:42,839
uh
 

2897
00:53:42,839 --> 00:53:45,490
uh
that's where you sacrifice the ideas

2898
00:53:45,490 --> 00:53:45,500
that's where you sacrifice the ideas
 

2899
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:48,349
that's where you sacrifice the ideas
pragmatism is in this case was good

2900
00:53:48,349 --> 00:53:48,359
pragmatism is in this case was good
 

2901
00:53:48,359 --> 00:53:51,349
pragmatism is in this case was good
because by taking a step back you know

2902
00:53:51,349 --> 00:53:51,359
because by taking a step back you know
 

2903
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:53,630

that only became a big deal in the
 

3989
01:13:48,780 --> 01:13:50,570
that only became a big deal in the
decades later and this just shows the

3990
01:13:50,570 --> 01:13:50,580
decades later and this just shows the
 

3991
01:13:50,580 --> 01:13:52,070
decades later and this just shows the
power of Jewish influence and I'm like

about like you know we know this is one
 

4029
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:40,310
about like you know we know this is one
of the reasons also why there was so

4030
01:14:40,310 --> 01:14:40,320
of the reasons also why there was so
 

4031
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:42,350
of the reasons also why there was so
much skepticism when the Holocaust

4032
01:14:42,350 --> 01:14:42,360
much skepticism when the Holocaust
 

4033
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:44,330
much skepticism when the Holocaust
started because this was regarded as

4034
01:14:44,330 --> 01:14:44,340
started because this was regarded as
 

4035
01:14:44,340 --> 01:14:46,189
started because this was regarded as
something that was barbaric this is from

4036
01:14:46,189 --> 01:14:46,199
something that was barbaric this is from
 

4037
01:14:46,199 --> 01:14:48,590
something that was barbaric this is from
the Middle Ages from the Biblical times

4038
01:14:48,590 --> 01:14:48,600
the Middle Ages from the Biblical times
 

4039
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:50,870
the Middle Ages from the Biblical times
we don't do this anymore we're civilized

4040
01:14:50,870 --> 01:14:50,880
we don't do this anymore we're civilized
 

4041
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:54,250
we don't do this anymore we're civilized
now so genocide is

4042
01:14:54,250 --> 01:14:54,260
now so genocide is
 

4043
01:14:54,260 --> 01:14:57,110
now so genocide is
historically the norm I think it's also

4044
01:14:57,110 --> 01:14:57,120
historically the norm I think it's also
 

4045
01:14:57,120 --> 01:15:00,229
historically the norm I think it's also
harder to pull it off emotionally when

4046
01:15:00,229 --> 01:15:00,239
harder to pull it off emotionally when
 

4047
01:15:00,239 --> 01:15:02,149
harder to pull it off emotionally when
you have the visuals and when you have

4048
01:15:02,149 --> 01:15:02,159
you have the visuals and when you have
 

4049
01:15:02,159 --> 01:15:04,310
you have the visuals and when you have
the audio and when you have the voices

4050
01:15:04,310 --> 01:15:04,320
the audio and when you have the voices
 

4051
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:06,649
the audio and when you have the voices
of the people being slaughtered we don't

4052
01:15:06,649 --> 01:15:06,659
of the people being slaughtered we don't
 

4053
01:15:06,659 --> 01:15:09,350
of the people being slaughtered we don't

thinking
 

4635
01:26:36,780 --> 01:26:38,570
thinking
um you get you give examples as like

4636

yeah so basically you know lucenko is

4640
01:26:44,270 --> 01:26:44,280
yeah so basically you know lucenko is
 

4641
01:26:44,280 --> 01:26:46,790
yeah so basically you know lucenko is
the textbook example of senkoism in

4642
01:26:46,790 --> 01:26:46,800
the textbook example of senkoism in
 

4643
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:49,550
the textbook example of senkoism in
biology so because Marxism is

4644
01:26:49,550 --> 01:26:49,560
biology so because Marxism is
 

4645
01:26:49,560 --> 01:26:52,550
biology so because Marxism is
materialist uh they didn't like the idea

4646
01:26:52,550 --> 01:26:52,560
materialist uh they didn't like the idea
 

4647
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:54,890
materialist uh they didn't like the idea
that genes pass on

4648
01:26:54,890 --> 01:26:54,900
that genes pass on
 

4649
01:26:54,900 --> 01:26:56,330
that genes pass on
um you know from one generation to the

4650
01:26:56,330 --> 01:26:56,340
um you know from one generation to the
 

4651
01:26:56,340 --> 01:26:58,189
um you know from one generation to the
next so lysenkoism kind of was a

4652
01:26:58,189 --> 01:26:58,199
next so lysenkoism kind of was a
 

4653
01:26:58,199 --> 01:27:01,189
next so lysenkoism kind of was a
rejection of um Mendel and and that kind

4654
01:27:01,189 --> 01:27:01,199
rejection of um Mendel and and that kind
 

4655
01:27:01,199 --> 01:27:04,610
rejection of um Mendel and and that kind
of genetics and if you reject genes

4656
01:27:04,610 --> 01:27:04,620
of genetics and if you reject genes
 

4657
01:27:04,620 --> 01:27:06,530
of genetics and if you reject genes
you're really going in a bad Direction

4658
01:27:06,530 --> 01:27:06,540
you're really going in a bad Direction
 

4659
01:27:06,540 --> 01:27:08,390
you're really going in a bad Direction
in terms of biology the Soviet Union's

4660
01:27:08,390 --> 01:27:08,400
in terms of biology the Soviet Union's
 

4661
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:10,070
in terms of biology the Soviet Union's
biological biological program became an

4662
01:27:10,070 --> 01:27:10,080
biological biological program became an
 

4663
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:11,750
biological biological program became an
international laughingstock at one point

4664
01:27:11,750 --> 01:27:11,760
international laughingstock at one point
 

4665
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:14,270
international laughingstock at one point
lucenko claimed he crossed the tomato in

4666
01:27:14,270 --> 01:27:14,280
lucenko claimed he crossed the tomato in
 

4667
01:27:14,280 --> 01:27:15,709

01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:34,669
in cultures like this your
way to achieve uh status wasn't

way to achieve uh status wasn't
 

4683
01:27:34,679 --> 01:27:36,350
way to achieve uh status wasn't
necessarily about your accomplishments

necessarily about your accomplishments
 

4685
01:27:36,360 --> 01:27:39,530
necessarily about your accomplishments
but about your loyalty to Orthodoxy so

4686

but about your loyalty to Orthodoxy so
 

4687
01:27:39,540 --> 01:27:41,629

result that was congruent with the
 

4691
01:27:44,280 --> 01:27:47,030
result that was congruent with the
broader ideology as a whole that was

4692
01:27:47,030 --> 01:27:47,040
broader ideology as a whole that was
 

4693
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:49,250
broader ideology as a whole that was
much better as a means of furthering

yourself in the Arts or in the

4696
01:27:50,810 --> 01:27:50,820
yourself in the Arts or in the
 

4697
01:27:50,820 --> 01:27:53,450
yourself in the Arts or in the
scientists in The Sciences than if you

4698
01:27:53,450 --> 01:27:53,460
scientists in The Sciences than if you
 

4699
01:27:53,460 --> 01:27:54,709
scientists in The Sciences than if you
had something that was Innovative

4700
01:27:54,709 --> 01:27:54,719
had something that was Innovative
 

4701
01:27:54,719 --> 01:27:56,209
had something that was Innovative
because if you're Innovative it's like

4702
01:27:56,209 --> 01:27:56,219
because if you're Innovative it's like
 

4703
01:27:56,219 --> 01:27:58,010
because if you're Innovative it's like
well how do I fit this in with the

4704
01:27:58,010 --> 01:27:58,020
well how do I fit this in with the
 

4705
01:27:58,020 --> 01:27:59,570
well how do I fit this in with the
broader ruling ideology the problem

4706
01:27:59,570 --> 01:27:59,580
broader ruling ideology the problem
 

4707
01:27:59,580 --> 01:28:01,370
broader ruling ideology the problem
totalitarianism one of the many problems

4708
01:28:01,370 --> 01:28:01,380
totalitarianism one of the many problems
 

4709
01:28:01,380 --> 01:28:05,390
totalitarianism one of the many problems
is everything literally everything has

4710
01:28:05,390 --> 01:28:05,400
is everything literally everything has
 

4711
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:07,490
is everything literally everything has
to be perceived through the lens of

01:28:07,490 --> 01:28:07,500
to be perceived through the lens of
 

4713
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:10,850
to be perceived through the lens of
ideology so and that is you know there

4714
01:28:10,850 --> 01:28:10,860
ideology so and that is you know there
 

4715
01:28:10,860 --> 01:28:11,870
ideology so and that is you know there
were

4716
01:28:11,870 --> 01:28:11,880
were
 

4717
01:28:11,880 --> 01:28:14,870
were
um scientists who were arrested or at

4718
01:28:14,870 --> 01:28:14,880
um scientists who were arrested or at
 

4719
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:16,910
um scientists who were arrested or at
least fired because of their theories

4720
01:28:16,910 --> 01:28:16,920
least fired because of their theories
 

4721
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:18,470
least fired because of their theories
about Sunspot developments because it

4722
01:28:18,470 --> 01:28:18,480
about Sunspot developments because it
 

4723
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:20,209
about Sunspot developments because it
was regarded as unmarxist uh there was

4724
01:28:20,209 --> 01:28:20,219
was regarded as unmarxist uh there was
 

4725
01:28:20,219 --> 01:28:22,790
was regarded as unmarxist uh there was
just there was a there was a

4726
01:28:22,790 --> 01:28:22,800
just there was a there was a
 

4727
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:25,189
just there was a there was a
an epidemic and all these horses got

4728
01:28:25,189 --> 01:28:25,199
an epidemic and all these horses got
 

4729
01:28:25,199 --> 01:28:27,649
an epidemic and all these horses got
sick and because the vaccine didn't work

4730
01:28:27,649 --> 01:28:27,659
sick and because the vaccine didn't work
 

4731
01:28:27,659 --> 01:28:30,050
sick and because the vaccine didn't work
on the horses the bacteriologists were

4732
01:28:30,050 --> 01:28:30,060
on the horses the bacteriologists were
 

4733
01:28:30,060 --> 01:28:31,250
on the horses the bacteriologists were
arrested because they were regardless

4734
01:28:31,250 --> 01:28:31,260
arrested because they were regardless
 

4735
01:28:31,260 --> 01:28:33,470
arrested because they were regardless
Wreckers it's like we gave you a job you

4736
01:28:33,470 --> 01:28:33,480
Wreckers it's like we gave you a job you
 

4737
01:28:33,480 --> 01:28:34,729
Wreckers it's like we gave you a job you
didn't do it you're undermining the

4738
01:28:34,729 --> 01:28:34,739
didn't do it you're undermining the
 

4739
01:28:34,739 --> 01:28:37,310
didn't do it you're undermining the
social estate so it's kind of a

4740
01:28:37,310 --> 01:28:37,320
social estate so it's kind of a
 

4741
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:39,709
social estate so it's kind of a
backwards series of incentives

4742
01:28:39,709 --> 01:28:39,719
backwards series of incentives
 

4743
01:28:39,719 --> 01:28:41,930
backwards series of incentives
um and it's designed to maintain at all

4744
01:28:41,930 --> 01:28:41,940
um and it's designed to maintain at all
 

4745
01:28:41,940 --> 01:28:44,090
um and it's designed to maintain at all
costs the ruling ideological

4746
01:28:44,090 --> 01:28:44,100
costs the ruling ideological
 

4747
01:28:44,100 --> 01:28:46,250
costs the ruling ideological
superstructure but you draw a small

4748
01:28:46,250 --> 01:28:46,260
superstructure but you draw a small
 

4749
01:28:46,260 --> 01:28:48,050
superstructure but you draw a small
distinction between the ideology and the

4750
01:28:48,050 --> 01:28:48,060
distinction between the ideology and the
 

4751
01:28:48,060 --> 01:28:49,669
distinction between the ideology and the
ideological superstructure and the

4752
01:28:49,669 --> 01:28:49,679
ideological superstructure and the
 

4753
01:28:49,679 --> 01:28:51,530
ideological superstructure and the
propaganda aren't those kind of

4754
01:28:51,530 --> 01:28:51,540
propaganda aren't those kind of
 

4755
01:28:51,540 --> 01:28:53,629
propaganda aren't those kind of
intermixed together well the ideological

4756
01:28:53,629 --> 01:28:53,639
intermixed together well the ideological
 

4757
01:28:53,639 --> 01:28:55,430
intermixed together well the ideological
is like in the sciences and what's true

4758
01:28:55,430 --> 01:28:55,440
is like in the sciences and what's true
 

4759
01:28:55,440 --> 01:28:57,169
is like in the sciences and what's true
in genetics or what's true in astronomy

4760
01:28:57,169 --> 01:28:57,179
in genetics or what's true in astronomy
 

4761
01:28:57,179 --> 01:28:58,490
in genetics or what's true in astronomy
that doesn't really percolate out to the

4762
01:28:58,490 --> 01:28:58,500
that doesn't really percolate out to the
 

4763
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:01,070
that doesn't really percolate out to the
masses right so the the problem does not

4764
01:29:01,070 --> 01:29:01,080
masses right so the the problem does not
 

4765
01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:02,870
masses right so the the problem does not
is maybe covering this scientist's grade

4766
01:29:02,870 --> 01:29:02,880
is maybe covering this scientist's grade
 

4767
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:04,790
is maybe covering this scientist's grade
or these discoveries are great but it's

4768
01:29:04,790 --> 01:29:04,800
or these discoveries are great but it's
 

4769
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:06,709
or these discoveries are great but it's
not necessarily the same as day-to-day

4770
01:29:06,709 --> 01:29:06,719
not necessarily the same as day-to-day
 

4771
01:29:06,719 --> 01:29:09,649
not necessarily the same as day-to-day
or glorifying political leaders but uh

4772
01:29:09,649 --> 01:29:09,659
or glorifying political leaders but uh
 

4773
01:29:09,659 --> 01:29:11,629
or glorifying political leaders but uh
Providence and manifestation of the idea

4774
01:29:11,629 --> 01:29:11,639
Providence and manifestation of the idea
 

4775
01:29:11,639 --> 01:29:14,629
Providence and manifestation of the idea
that truth can be conjured up yes it can

4776
01:29:14,629 --> 01:29:14,639
that truth can be conjured up yes it can
 

4777
01:29:14,639 --> 01:29:16,310
that truth can be conjured up yes it can
be constructed and it could be altered

4778
01:29:16,310 --> 01:29:16,320
be constructed and it could be altered
 

4779
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:17,709
be constructed and it could be altered
quickly and then

4780
01:29:17,709 --> 01:29:17,719
quickly and then
 

4781
01:29:17,719 --> 01:29:21,830
quickly and then
I just I wonder so 1984 caricatures that

4782
01:29:21,830 --> 01:29:21,840
I just I wonder so 1984 caricatures that
 

4783
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:24,350
I just I wonder so 1984 caricatures that
I wanted to a degree

4784
01:29:24,350 --> 01:29:24,360
I wanted to a degree
 

4785
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:26,930
I wanted to a degree
it really could control the way you

4786
01:29:26,930 --> 01:29:26,940
it really could control the way you
 

4787
01:29:26,940 --> 01:29:28,669
it really could control the way you
think

4788
01:29:28,669 --> 01:29:28,679
think
 

4789
01:29:28,679 --> 01:29:31,129
think
that like how many people it affected I

4790
01:29:31,129 --> 01:29:31,139
that like how many people it affected I
 

4791
01:29:31,139 --> 01:29:32,750
that like how many people it affected I
can give you an example a very easy one

4792
01:29:32,750 --> 01:29:32,760
can give you an example a very easy one
 

4793
01:29:32,760 --> 01:29:35,709
can give you an example a very easy one
so again with with regarding North Korea

4794
01:29:35,709 --> 01:29:35,719
so again with with regarding North Korea
 

4795
01:29:35,719 --> 01:29:38,330
so again with with regarding North Korea
Kim uh the great leader Kimmel sung who

4796
01:29:38,330 --> 01:29:38,340
Kim uh the great leader Kimmel sung who
 

4797
01:29:38,340 --> 01:29:40,729
Kim uh the great leader Kimmel sung who
was the founder of North Korea had a

4798
01:29:40,729 --> 01:29:40,739
was the founder of North Korea had a
 

4799
01:29:40,739 --> 01:29:44,030
was the founder of North Korea had a
tumor on the back of his neck and it was

4800
01:29:44,030 --> 01:29:44,040
tumor on the back of his neck and it was
 

4801
01:29:44,040 --> 01:29:46,550
tumor on the back of his neck and it was
too close to the skull the sky spinal

4802
01:29:46,550 --> 01:29:46,560
too close to the skull the sky spinal
 

4803
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:48,110
too close to the skull the sky spinal
column so they couldn't operate on it

4804
01:29:48,110 --> 01:29:48,120
column so they couldn't operate on it
 

4805
01:29:48,120 --> 01:29:49,430
column so they couldn't operate on it
and throughout his life it got bigger

4806
01:29:49,430 --> 01:29:49,440
and throughout his life it got bigger
 

4807
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:52,490
and throughout his life it got bigger
and bigger and I got mixed messages in

4808
01:29:52,490 --> 01:29:52,500
and bigger and I got mixed messages in
 

4809
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:54,590
and bigger and I got mixed messages in
my research about whether North Koreans

4810
01:29:54,590 --> 01:29:54,600
my research about whether North Koreans
 

4811
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:55,729
my research about whether North Koreans
knew about it because there was

4812
01:29:55,729 --> 01:29:55,739
knew about it because there was
 

4813
01:29:55,739 --> 01:29:57,649
knew about it because there was
photographed him from this angle

4814
01:29:57,649 --> 01:29:57,659
photographed him from this angle
 

4815
01:29:57,659 --> 01:30:00,169
photographed him from this angle
and I met a refugee

4816
01:30:00,169 --> 01:30:00,179
and I met a refugee
 

4817
01:30:00,179 --> 01:30:02,629
and I met a refugee
um and I asked him like did you know

4818
01:30:02,629 --> 01:30:02,639
um and I asked him like did you know
 

4819
01:30:02,639 --> 01:30:04,070
um and I asked him like did you know
that he had this tumor she goes yeah

4820
01:30:04,070 --> 01:30:04,080
that he had this tumor she goes yeah
 

4821
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:05,330
that he had this tumor she goes yeah
yeah when people played him in the

4822
01:30:05,330 --> 01:30:05,340
yeah when people played him in the
 

4823
01:30:05,340 --> 01:30:06,890
yeah when people played him in the
movies they would you know you'd make up

4824
01:30:06,890 --> 01:30:06,900
movies they would you know you'd make up
 

4825
01:30:06,900 --> 01:30:09,050
movies they would you know you'd make up
there and she goes uh it was an old war

4826
01:30:09,050 --> 01:30:09,060
there and she goes uh it was an old war
 

4827
01:30:09,060 --> 01:30:12,050
there and she goes uh it was an old war
injury and I go why would a war injury

4828
01:30:12,050 --> 01:30:12,060
injury and I go why would a war injury
 

4829
01:30:12,060 --> 01:30:14,330
injury and I go why would a war injury

no no this isn't what it looks like if
 

5099
01:35:23,219 --> 01:35:24,950
no no this isn't what it looks like if
you look here if you look there it's

5100
01:35:24,950 --> 01:35:24,960
you look here if you look there it's
 

5101
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:26,930
you look here if you look there it's
cropped here so on and so forth but

5102
01:35:26,930 --> 01:35:26,940
cropped here so on and so forth but
 

5103
01:35:26,940 --> 01:35:29,390
cropped here so on and so forth but
that's still much more useful than just

5104
01:35:29,390 --> 01:35:29,400
that's still much more useful than just
 

5105
01:35:29,400 --> 01:35:32,629

01:35:37,620 --> 01:35:39,649
truth has a way of because it's
everything is so interconnected truth no

5112
01:35:39,649 --> 01:35:39,659
everything is so interconnected truth no
 

5113
01:35:39,659 --> 01:35:41,810
everything is so interconnected truth no
matter what has what finding his way to

5114
01:35:41,810 --> 01:35:41,820
matter what has what finding his way to
 

5115
01:35:41,820 --> 01:35:44,570
matter what has what finding his way to
the populace and also there's an there's

5116
01:35:44,570 --> 01:35:44,580
the populace and also there's an there's
 

5117
01:35:44,580 --> 01:35:47,209
the populace and also there's an there's
a big asymmetry in terms of trust

5118
01:35:47,209 --> 01:35:47,219
a big asymmetry in terms of trust
 

5119
01:35:47,219 --> 01:35:50,750
a big asymmetry in terms of trust
so if I tell you a hundred truths and

5120
01:35:50,750 --> 01:35:50,760
so if I tell you a hundred truths and
 

5121
01:35:50,760 --> 01:35:54,110
so if I tell you a hundred truths and
One Lie that lie is equal I'm I'm

5122
01:35:54,110 --> 01:35:54,120
One Lie that lie is equal I'm I'm
 

5123
01:35:54,120 --> 01:35:56,030
One Lie that lie is equal I'm I'm
screwed because once you catch me in

5124
01:35:56,030 --> 01:35:56,040
screwed because once you catch me in
 

5125
01:35:56,040 --> 01:35:57,530
screwed because once you catch me in
like a you don't have to kill someone

5126
01:35:57,530 --> 01:35:57,540
like a you don't have to kill someone
 

5127
01:35:57,540 --> 01:35:58,850
like a you don't have to kill someone
every day to be a murderer right you

5128
01:35:58,850 --> 01:35:58,860
every day to be a murderer right you
 

5129
01:35:58,860 --> 01:36:01,250
every day to be a murderer right you
only have to do it once so if you catch

5130
01:36:01,250 --> 01:36:01,260
only have to do it once so if you catch
 

5131
01:36:01,260 --> 01:36:04,010
only have to do it once so if you catch
me in a Brazen lie you're gonna look at

5132
01:36:04,010 --> 01:36:04,020
me in a Brazen lie you're gonna look at
 

5133
01:36:04,020 --> 01:36:05,510
me in a Brazen lie you're gonna look at
everything I say after that with an

5134
01:36:05,510 --> 01:36:05,520
everything I say after that with an
 

5135
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:07,070
everything I say after that with an
enormous grain of salt

5136
01:36:07,070 --> 01:36:07,080
enormous grain of salt
 

5137
01:36:07,080 --> 01:36:09,470
enormous grain of salt
um so that is another big asymmetry in

5138
01:36:09,470 --> 01:36:09,480
um so that is another big asymmetry in
 

5139
01:36:09,480 --> 01:36:12,050
um so that is another big asymmetry in
favor of truth if someone trusts you you

5140
01:36:12,050 --> 01:36:12,060
favor of truth if someone trusts you you
 

5141
01:36:12,060 --> 01:36:14,030
favor of truth if someone trusts you you
have to be honest all the time and

5142
01:36:14,030 --> 01:36:14,040
have to be honest all the time and
 

5143
01:36:14,040 --> 01:36:15,770
have to be honest all the time and
you're gonna make mistakes you can own

5144
01:36:15,770 --> 01:36:15,780
you're gonna make mistakes you can own
 

5145
01:36:15,780 --> 01:36:17,750
you're gonna make mistakes you can own
those mistakes be like hey this is why I

5146
01:36:17,750 --> 01:36:17,760
those mistakes be like hey this is why I
 

5147
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:19,129
those mistakes be like hey this is why I
made the mistake this is why I said such

5148
01:36:19,129 --> 01:36:19,139
made the mistake this is why I said such
 

5149
01:36:19,139 --> 01:36:21,229
made the mistake this is why I said such
and such okay but the flip side of that

5150
01:36:21,229 --> 01:36:21,239
and such okay but the flip side of that
 

5151
01:36:21,239 --> 01:36:24,290
and such okay but the flip side of that
which has been disheartening to me is

5152
01:36:24,290 --> 01:36:24,300
which has been disheartening to me is
 

5153
01:36:24,300 --> 01:36:26,350
which has been disheartening to me is
that people on the conspiracy side

5154
01:36:26,350 --> 01:36:26,360
that people on the conspiracy side
 

5155
01:36:26,360 --> 01:36:29,270
that people on the conspiracy side
conspiracy theory side of things

5156
01:36:29,270 --> 01:36:29,280
conspiracy theory side of things
 

5157
01:36:29,280 --> 01:36:32,090
conspiracy theory side of things
I've noticed how easy it is to just call

5158
01:36:32,090 --> 01:36:32,100
I've noticed how easy it is to just call
 

5159
01:36:32,100 --> 01:36:35,390
I've noticed how easy it is to just call
something a lie yes and then that

5160
01:36:35,390 --> 01:36:35,400
something a lie yes and then that
 

5161
01:36:35,400 --> 01:36:37,189
something a lie yes and then that
becomes viral for some reason there's a

5162
01:36:37,189 --> 01:36:37,199
becomes viral for some reason there's a
 

5163
01:36:37,199 --> 01:36:39,950
becomes viral for some reason there's a
desire for people yeah for anyone who

5164
01:36:39,950 --> 01:36:39,960
desire for people yeah for anyone who
 

5165
01:36:39,960 --> 01:36:41,030
desire for people yeah for anyone who

different waves and if it wasn't
 

5349
01:40:04,199 --> 01:40:07,370
different waves and if it wasn't
efficacious why was it so insistent that

we do it all do it at the very beginning

5352
01:40:09,229 --> 01:40:09,239

I guess David Goggins self-published uh

6488
02:01:45,410 --> 02:01:45,420
I guess David Goggins self-published uh
 

6489
02:01:45,420 --> 02:01:47,570
I guess David Goggins self-published uh
his book because it used to be you

6490
02:01:47,570 --> 02:01:47,580
his book because it used to be you

02:01:50,750 --> 02:01:50,760
deal so it's like an admission of
 

6495
02:01:50,760 --> 02:01:52,189
deal so it's like an admission of
failure

6496
02:01:52,189 --> 02:01:52,199
failure
 

6497
02:01:52,199 --> 02:01:53,990
failure
yeah so you would recommend it as

6498
02:01:53,990 --> 02:01:54,000
yeah so you would recommend it as
 

6499
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,510
yeah so you would recommend it as
something for for authors no I would

6500
02:01:56,510 --> 02:01:56,520
something for for authors no I would
 

6501
02:01:56,520 --> 02:01:58,490
something for for authors no I would
recommend it as something for authors of

6502
02:01:58,490 --> 02:01:58,500
recommend it as something for authors of
 

6503
02:01:58,500 --> 02:02:00,830
recommend it as something for authors of
a certain stature for lack a better term

6504
02:02:00,830 --> 02:02:00,840
a certain stature for lack a better term
 

6505
02:02:00,840 --> 02:02:03,770
a certain stature for lack a better term
because it is still in terms of your

6506
02:02:03,770 --> 02:02:03,780
because it is still in terms of your
 

6507
02:02:03,780 --> 02:02:06,229
because it is still in terms of your
resume and your experience it's better

6508
02:02:06,229 --> 02:02:06,239
resume and your experience it's better
 

6509
02:02:06,239 --> 02:02:09,410
resume and your experience it's better
to get a crappy advance and have a book

6510
02:02:09,410 --> 02:02:09,420
to get a crappy advance and have a book
 

6511
02:02:09,420 --> 02:02:12,470
to get a crappy advance and have a book
with Saint Martins that goes nowhere

6512
02:02:12,470 --> 02:02:12,480
with Saint Martins that goes nowhere
 

6513
02:02:12,480 --> 02:02:15,229
with Saint Martins that goes nowhere
than a self-published book that goes

6514
02:02:15,229 --> 02:02:15,239
than a self-published book that goes
 

6515
02:02:15,239 --> 02:02:17,990
than a self-published book that goes
nowhere so the other thing is you have

6516
02:02:17,990 --> 02:02:18,000
nowhere so the other thing is you have
 

6517
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:19,430
nowhere so the other thing is you have
to make sure you have enough an audience

6518
02:02:19,430 --> 02:02:19,440
to make sure you have enough an audience
 

6519
02:02:19,440 --> 02:02:21,229
to make sure you have enough an audience
that you can move some copies

this is this is the entire Machinery of
 

7691
02:24:44,460 --> 02:24:46,370
this is this is the entire Machinery of
it it's not it's that's modern

7692
02:24:46,370 --> 02:24:46,380
it it's not it's that's modern
 

7693
02:24:46,380 --> 02:24:49,130
it it's not it's that's modern
journalism and I suppose at that time

because there's PR pieces think about
 

7703

02:25:53,090 --> 02:25:53,100
how they would write one thing and say
 

7747
02:25:53,100 --> 02:25:54,830
how they would write one thing and say
another thing and then think another

another thing and then think another
 

7749
02:25:54,840 --> 02:25:56,750
another thing and then think another
thing and each of those steps was just

7750
02:25:56,750 --> 02:25:56,760
thing and each of those steps was just
 

7751
02:25:56,760 --> 02:25:58,969
thing and each of those steps was just
more and more like kind of lying in

7752

02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:08,690
so you uh reference an apple bomb
and say that quote starvation was not

7760
02:26:08,690 --> 02:26:08,700
and say that quote starvation was not
 

7761
02:26:08,700 --> 02:26:10,730
and say that quote starvation was not
simply a consequence it was the goal and

7762
02:26:10,730 --> 02:26:10,740
simply a consequence it was the goal and
 

7763
02:26:10,740 --> 02:26:12,889
simply a consequence it was the goal and
it was the law Stalin intended to break

7764
02:26:12,889 --> 02:26:12,899
it was the law Stalin intended to break
 

7765
02:26:12,899 --> 02:26:15,950
it was the law Stalin intended to break
the ukrainians once and for all and thus

7766
02:26:15,950 --> 02:26:15,960
the ukrainians once and for all and thus
 

7767
02:26:15,960 --> 02:26:17,870
the ukrainians once and for all and thus
became common for villagers to spy and

7768
02:26:17,870 --> 02:26:17,880
became common for villagers to spy and
 

7769
02:26:17,880 --> 02:26:19,969
became common for villagers to spy and
inform on one another turning in a

7772
02:26:22,010 --> 02:26:22,020
neighbor for having a sack of grain
 

7773
02:26:22,020 --> 02:26:24,170
neighbor for having a sack of grain
might be the easiest and safest way to

7774
02:26:24,170 --> 02:26:24,180
might be the easiest and safest way to

7783
02:26:34,800 --> 02:26:37,429
it to what degree does Stalin anticipate
this kind of suffering as a consequence

7784
02:26:37,429 --> 02:26:37,439
this kind of suffering as a consequence
 

7785
02:26:37,439 --> 02:26:39,950
this kind of suffering as a consequence
of the collectivization policy I don't

7786
02:26:39,950 --> 02:26:39,960
of the collectivization policy I don't
 

7787
02:26:39,960 --> 02:26:41,990
of the collectivization policy I don't
know that he intended the suffering to

7788
02:26:41,990 --> 02:26:42,000
know that he intended the suffering to
 

7789
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:43,610
know that he intended the suffering to
be consequence of the collectivization

7790
02:26:43,610 --> 02:26:43,620
be consequence of the collectivization
 

7791
02:26:43,620 --> 02:26:45,950
be consequence of the collectivization
but he it was

7792
02:26:45,950 --> 02:26:45,960
but he it was
 

7793
02:26:45,960 --> 02:26:47,450
but he it was
quite

7794
02:26:47,450 --> 02:26:47,460
quite
 

7795
02:26:47,460 --> 02:26:50,030
quite
apparent and I think there's a pretty

7796
02:26:50,030 --> 02:26:50,040
apparent and I think there's a pretty
 

7797
02:26:50,040 --> 02:26:53,150
apparent and I think there's a pretty
heavy consensus nowadays that his goal

7798
02:26:53,150 --> 02:26:53,160
heavy consensus nowadays that his goal
 

7799
02:26:53,160 --> 02:26:56,750
heavy consensus nowadays that his goal

I I mean I you know I
I certainly having visited there this

7832
02:27:30,710 --> 02:27:30,720
I certainly having visited there this
 

7833
02:27:30,720 --> 02:27:34,370
I certainly having visited there this
year because of the most recent invasion

7834
02:27:34,370 --> 02:27:34,380
year because of the most recent invasion
 

7835
02:27:34,380 --> 02:27:38,450
year because of the most recent invasion
in February in February that hatred is

7836
02:27:38,450 --> 02:27:38,460
in February in February that hatred is
 

7837
02:27:38,460 --> 02:27:41,630
in February in February that hatred is
uh Nationwide and very intense but I

7838
02:27:41,630 --> 02:27:41,640
uh Nationwide and very intense but I
 

7839
02:27:41,640 --> 02:27:43,429
uh Nationwide and very intense but I
don't know I think the feeling the

7840
02:27:43,429 --> 02:27:43,439
don't know I think the feeling the
 

7841
02:27:43,439 --> 02:27:45,230
don't know I think the feeling the
emotions were much more complex before

7842
02:27:45,230 --> 02:27:45,240
emotions were much more complex before
 

7843
02:27:45,240 --> 02:27:47,090
emotions were much more complex before
but at the same time at least they were

7844
02:27:47,090 --> 02:27:47,100
but at the same time at least they were
 

7845
02:27:47,100 --> 02:27:48,889
but at the same time at least they were
under occupation before right and they

7846
02:27:48,889 --> 02:27:48,899
under occupation before right and they
 

7847
02:27:48,899 --> 02:27:50,090
under occupation before right and they
couldn't speak Ukrainian they had to

7848
02:27:50,090 --> 02:27:50,100
couldn't speak Ukrainian they had to
 

7849
02:27:50,100 --> 02:27:54,290
couldn't speak Ukrainian they had to
speak Russian so this was a thing

7850
02:27:54,290 --> 02:27:54,300

 

7851
02:27:54,300 --> 02:27:58,370

but because of the forced intermixing

7852
02:27:58,370 --> 02:27:58,380
but because of the forced intermixing
 

7853
02:27:58,380 --> 02:28:01,309
but because of the forced intermixing
it's a it's a more complex story okay

7854
02:28:01,309 --> 02:28:01,319
it's a it's a more complex story okay
 

7855
02:28:01,319 --> 02:28:04,849
it's a it's a more complex story okay
but I mean they weren't certainly fans

7856
02:28:04,849 --> 02:28:04,859
but I mean they weren't certainly fans
 

7857
02:28:04,859 --> 02:28:06,590
but I mean they weren't certainly fans
yeah but there's

7858
02:28:06,590 --> 02:28:06,600
yeah but there's
 

7859
02:28:06,600 --> 02:28:08,210
yeah but there's
people that came from Marshall that are

7860
02:28:08,210 --> 02:28:08,220
people that came from Marshall that are
 

7861
02:28:08,220 --> 02:28:09,410
people that came from Marshall that are
living there they're marrying they're

7862
02:28:09,410 --> 02:28:09,420
living there they're marrying they're
 

7863
02:28:09,420 --> 02:28:11,330
living there they're marrying they're
falling in love they're working with

7864
02:28:11,330 --> 02:28:11,340
falling in love they're working with
 

7865
02:28:11,340 --> 02:28:13,490
falling in love they're working with
each other so like there is a the bigger

7866
02:28:13,490 --> 02:28:13,500
each other so like there is a the bigger
 

7867
02:28:13,500 --> 02:28:15,469
each other so like there is a the bigger
atrocity of the genocide of it but

7868
02:28:15,469 --> 02:28:15,479
atrocity of the genocide of it but
 

7869
02:28:15,479 --> 02:28:17,570
atrocity of the genocide of it but
there's also the reality of intermixing

7870
02:28:17,570 --> 02:28:17,580
there's also the reality of intermixing
 

7871
02:28:17,580 --> 02:28:19,610
there's also the reality of intermixing
over people's well sure I mean there's

7872
02:28:19,610 --> 02:28:19,620
over people's well sure I mean there's
 

7873
02:28:19,620 --> 02:28:21,650
over people's well sure I mean there's
the atrocity of slavery in the United

7874
02:28:21,650 --> 02:28:21,660
the atrocity of slavery in the United
 

7875
02:28:21,660 --> 02:28:24,050
the atrocity of slavery in the United
States but then there's also a reality

7876
02:28:24,050 --> 02:28:24,060
States but then there's also a reality
 

7877
02:28:24,060 --> 02:28:26,389
States but then there's also a reality
that there's now an intermixing of a of

7878
02:28:26,389 --> 02:28:26,399
that there's now an intermixing of a of
 

7879
02:28:26,399 --> 02:28:28,550
that there's now an intermixing of a of
a peoples and now they fall in love and

7880
02:28:28,550 --> 02:28:28,560
a peoples and now they fall in love and
 

7881
02:28:28,560 --> 02:28:30,410
a peoples and now they fall in love and
they live after after slavery is

7882
02:28:30,410 --> 02:28:30,420
they live after after slavery is
 

7883
02:28:30,420 --> 02:28:32,510
they live after after slavery is
abolished it's that's just the real like

7884
02:28:32,510 --> 02:28:32,520
abolished it's that's just the real like
 

7885
02:28:32,520 --> 02:28:33,469
abolished it's that's just the real like
uh

7886
02:28:33,469 --> 02:28:33,479
uh
 

7887
02:28:33,479 --> 02:28:35,950
uh
after the genocide right

7888
02:28:35,950 --> 02:28:35,960
after the genocide right
 

7889
02:28:35,960 --> 02:28:39,410
after the genocide right
precedes a kind of generational

7890
02:28:39,410 --> 02:28:39,420
precedes a kind of generational
 

7891
02:28:39,420 --> 02:28:40,969
precedes a kind of generational
integration

7892
02:28:40,969 --> 02:28:40,979
integration
 

7893
02:28:40,979 --> 02:28:43,250
integration
that still remembers like the the

7894
02:28:43,250 --> 02:28:43,260
that still remembers like the the
 

7895
02:28:43,260 --> 02:28:46,670
that still remembers like the the
suffering reverberates but there's still

7896
02:28:46,670 --> 02:28:46,680
suffering reverberates but there's still
 

7897
02:28:46,680 --> 02:28:48,110
suffering reverberates but there's still
um it's a different culture that's

7898
02:28:48,110 --> 02:28:48,120
um it's a different culture that's
 

7899
02:28:48,120 --> 02:28:54,050
um it's a different culture that's
created and now I think

7900
02:28:54,050 --> 02:28:54,060

 

7901
02:28:54,060 --> 02:28:56,630

I mean I have complexity most of my

7902
02:28:56,630 --> 02:28:56,640
I mean I have complexity most of my
 

7903
02:28:56,640 --> 02:28:59,210
I mean I have complexity most of my
family is from Ukraine so I have a and

7904
02:28:59,210 --> 02:28:59,220
family is from Ukraine so I have a and
 

7905
02:28:59,220 --> 02:29:03,230
family is from Ukraine so I have a and
it's my understanding is grounded in um

7906
02:29:03,230 --> 02:29:03,240
it's my understanding is grounded in um
 

7907
02:29:03,240 --> 02:29:06,770
it's my understanding is grounded in um
Soviet Ukraine but there's something in

7908
02:29:06,770 --> 02:29:06,780
Soviet Ukraine but there's something in
 

7909
02:29:06,780 --> 02:29:09,770
Soviet Ukraine but there's something in
the last 30 years that's different where

7910
02:29:09,770 --> 02:29:09,780
the last 30 years that's different where
 

7911
02:29:09,780 --> 02:29:11,389
the last 30 years that's different where
now after the collapse of the Soviet

7912
02:29:11,389 --> 02:29:11,399
now after the collapse of the Soviet
 

7913
02:29:11,399 --> 02:29:13,190
now after the collapse of the Soviet
Union there's a true

7914
02:29:13,190 --> 02:29:13,200
Union there's a true
 

7915
02:29:13,200 --> 02:29:15,230
Union there's a true
maybe you've renewed fight for

7916
02:29:15,230 --> 02:29:15,240
maybe you've renewed fight for
 

7917
02:29:15,240 --> 02:29:16,670
maybe you've renewed fight for
independence and that's a different

7918
02:29:16,670 --> 02:29:16,680
independence and that's a different
 

7919
02:29:16,680 --> 02:29:17,870
independence and that's a different
thing

7920
02:29:17,870 --> 02:29:17,880
thing
 

7921
02:29:17,880 --> 02:29:19,550
thing
but there's also a difference like you

7922
02:29:19,550 --> 02:29:19,560
but there's also a difference like you
 

7923
02:29:19,560 --> 02:29:20,870
but there's also a difference like you
know if I go to North Korea as an

7924
02:29:20,870 --> 02:29:20,880
know if I go to North Korea as an
 

7925
02:29:20,880 --> 02:29:23,510
know if I go to North Korea as an
American right they're very friendly now

02:29:23,510 --> 02:29:23,520
American right they're very friendly now
 

7927
02:29:23,520 --> 02:29:27,230
American right they're very friendly now
right they don't perceive me as part of

7928
02:29:27,230 --> 02:29:27,240
right they don't perceive me as part of
 

7929
02:29:27,240 --> 02:29:30,349
right they don't perceive me as part of
the yank Devils they're like okay you're

7930
02:29:30,349 --> 02:29:30,359
the yank Devils they're like okay you're
 

7931
02:29:30,359 --> 02:29:31,790
the yank Devils they're like okay you're
an American but you know you come from

7932

7935
02:29:33,479 --> 02:29:34,849
America so yeah there's going to be
intermarriage but that's a big

7936
02:29:34,849 --> 02:29:34,859
intermarriage but that's a big
 

7937
02:29:34,859 --> 02:29:36,910
intermarriage but that's a big
difference between the perception of

7938
02:29:36,910 --> 02:29:36,920
difference between the perception of
 

7939
02:29:36,920 --> 02:29:40,849
difference between the perception of
Russia as an entity as opposed to some

7940
02:29:40,849 --> 02:29:40,859
Russia as an entity as opposed to some
 

7941
02:29:40,859 --> 02:29:43,370
Russia as an entity as opposed to some
individual Russians

7942
02:29:43,370 --> 02:29:43,380
individual Russians
 

7943
02:29:43,380 --> 02:29:46,309
individual Russians

lot of friends and family in Ukraine
until the war started really so they

7950
02:29:52,790 --> 02:29:52,800
until the war started really so they
 

7951
02:29:52,800 --> 02:29:54,290
until the war started really so they
really didn't have this kind of low-key

7952
02:29:54,290 --> 02:29:54,300

02:30:13,309 --> 02:30:13,319
was saying earlier how humans Define
 

7969
02:30:13,319 --> 02:30:15,110
was saying earlier how humans Define
themselves by opposition so now that

02:30:15,110 --> 02:30:15,120
themselves by opposition so now that
 

7971

7974
02:30:18,830 --> 02:30:18,840
this little stuff doesn't matter we are
 

7975
02:30:18,840 --> 02:30:19,910
this little stuff doesn't matter we are
all United because we have a common

7976

all United because we have a common
enemy but there's also as as you know

7978
02:30:22,309 --> 02:30:22,319
enemy but there's also as as you know
 

7979
02:30:22,319 --> 02:30:25,429
enemy but there's also as as you know
there's regions and there's

7980
02:30:25,429 --> 02:30:25,439
there's regions and there's
 

7981
02:30:25,439 --> 02:30:26,990
there's regions and there's
um there's just groups of different

7982
02:30:26,990 --> 02:30:27,000
um there's just groups of different
 

7983
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:28,730
um there's just groups of different
people that people and then one of the

7984
02:30:28,730 --> 02:30:28,740
people that people and then one of the
 

7985
02:30:28,740 --> 02:30:30,469
people that people and then one of the
big divides of course is the City versus

7986
02:30:30,469 --> 02:30:30,479
big divides of course is the City versus
 

7987
02:30:30,479 --> 02:30:32,990
big divides of course is the City versus
Rural and then in the case of Ukraine

7988
02:30:32,990 --> 02:30:33,000
Rural and then in the case of Ukraine
 

7989
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:35,510
Rural and then in the case of Ukraine
it's it's eastern Ukraine and Western

7990
02:30:35,510 --> 02:30:35,520
it's it's eastern Ukraine and Western
 

7991
02:30:35,520 --> 02:30:37,910
it's it's eastern Ukraine and Western
Ukraine it's very difficult to know what

7992
02:30:37,910 --> 02:30:37,920
Ukraine it's very difficult to know what
 

7993
02:30:37,920 --> 02:30:39,469
Ukraine it's very difficult to know what
the truth is because my personal

7994
02:30:39,469 --> 02:30:39,479
the truth is because my personal
 

7995
02:30:39,479 --> 02:30:43,010
the truth is because my personal
experience is sampled right you know I

7996
02:30:43,010 --> 02:30:43,020
experience is sampled right you know I
 

7997
02:30:43,020 --> 02:30:44,450
experience is sampled right you know I
don't know how many ukrainians I know

7998
02:30:44,450 --> 02:30:44,460
don't know how many ukrainians I know
 

7999
02:30:44,460 --> 02:30:46,250
don't know how many ukrainians I know
maybe like 30 or 40 before this trip

8000
02:30:46,250 --> 02:30:46,260
maybe like 30 or 40 before this trip
 

8001
02:30:46,260 --> 02:30:48,889
maybe like 30 or 40 before this trip
like 30 or 40 and then I'm close with

8002
02:30:48,889 --> 02:30:48,899
like 30 or 40 and then I'm close with
 

8003
02:30:48,899 --> 02:30:50,690
like 30 or 40 and then I'm close with
just a handful

8004
02:30:50,690 --> 02:30:50,700
just a handful
 

8005
02:30:50,700 --> 02:30:52,670
just a handful
but then it's hard to know because you

8006
02:30:52,670 --> 02:30:52,680
but then it's hard to know because you
 

8007
02:30:52,680 --> 02:30:54,110
but then it's hard to know because you
get a lot of Western press perspective

8008
02:30:54,110 --> 02:30:54,120
get a lot of Western press perspective
 

8009
02:30:54,120 --> 02:30:55,969
get a lot of Western press perspective
and you get the Russian perspective and

8010
02:30:55,969 --> 02:30:55,979
and you get the Russian perspective and
 

8011
02:30:55,979 --> 02:30:57,469
and you get the Russian perspective and
you got other perspectives it's very

8012
02:30:57,469 --> 02:30:57,479
you got other perspectives it's very
 

8013
02:30:57,479 --> 02:31:00,590
you got other perspectives it's very
hard to know how much hate there is

8014
02:31:00,590 --> 02:31:00,600
hard to know how much hate there is
 

8015
02:31:00,600 --> 02:31:03,770
hard to know how much hate there is
um outside of this conflict so my my

8016
02:31:03,770 --> 02:31:03,780

primary question is and this is what I
asked a lot of people when I visited

8020
02:31:07,490 --> 02:31:07,500

but it would be really hard to cover it
 

8253
02:35:47,100 --> 02:35:50,030

journalists to somehow reveal the truth

8274
02:36:10,070 --> 02:36:10,080
journalists to somehow reveal the truth
 

8275

that's easier to hide that's easier for
 

8281
02:36:17,399 --> 02:36:18,830
that's easier to hide that's easier for
journalists to deceive themselves and

02:36:18,830 --> 02:36:18,840
journalists to deceive themselves and
 

8283
02:36:18,840 --> 02:36:20,929
journalists to deceive themselves and
easier for the authoritarian leader to

still in power now Richard Nixon is
raising a toast to him like that story

8402
02:38:38,929 --> 02:38:38,939
raising a toast to him like that story
 

8403
02:38:38,939 --> 02:38:40,610
raising a toast to him like that story
is just like how am I supposed to feel

8404
02:38:40,610 --> 02:38:40,620
is just like how am I supposed to feel
 

8405
02:38:40,620 --> 02:38:41,929
is just like how am I supposed to feel
about this

8406
02:38:41,929 --> 02:38:41,939
about this
 

8407
02:38:41,939 --> 02:38:44,450
about this
yeah it feels like when there's tanks

8408
02:38:44,450 --> 02:38:44,460
yeah it feels like when there's tanks
 

8409
02:38:44,460 --> 02:38:46,250
yeah it feels like when there's tanks
and there's war and there's military

8410
02:38:46,250 --> 02:38:46,260
and there's war and there's military
 

8411
02:38:46,260 --> 02:38:48,710
and there's war and there's military
conflict then um it's more actionable

8412
02:38:48,710 --> 02:38:48,720
conflict then um it's more actionable
 

8413
02:38:48,720 --> 02:38:51,410
conflict then um it's more actionable
you can cover it yeah and uh it did seem

8414
02:38:51,410 --> 02:38:51,420
you can cover it yeah and uh it did seem
 

8415
02:38:51,420 --> 02:38:53,030
you can cover it yeah and uh it did seem
like Nazi Germany I don't know if

8416
02:38:53,030 --> 02:38:53,040
like Nazi Germany I don't know if
 

8417
02:38:53,040 --> 02:38:54,830
like Nazi Germany I don't know if
Holocaust was the thing that made it

8418
02:38:54,830 --> 02:38:54,840
Holocaust was the thing that made it
 

8419
02:38:54,840 --> 02:38:56,750
Holocaust was the thing that made it
most coverable I think it was that this

8420
02:38:56,750 --> 02:38:56,760
most coverable I think it was that this
 

8421
02:38:56,760 --> 02:38:58,790
most coverable I think it was that this
is a threat to the entire

8422
02:38:58,790 --> 02:38:58,800
is a threat to the entire
 

8423
02:38:58,800 --> 02:39:00,590
is a threat to the entire
so yeah they were a war with them yeah

8424
02:39:00,590 --> 02:39:00,600
so yeah they were a war with them yeah
 

8425
02:39:00,600 --> 02:39:02,389
so yeah they were a war with them yeah
this is that's what makes it coverable

8426
02:39:02,389 --> 02:39:02,399
this is that's what makes it coverable
 

8427
02:39:02,399 --> 02:39:04,550
this is that's what makes it coverable
and if the Holocaust was happening just

8428
02:39:04,550 --> 02:39:04,560
and if the Holocaust was happening just
 

8429
02:39:04,560 --> 02:39:08,090
and if the Holocaust was happening just
inside that country inside of Germany

8430
02:39:08,090 --> 02:39:08,100
inside that country inside of Germany
 

8431
02:39:08,100 --> 02:39:10,010
inside that country inside of Germany
or even if it didn't expand Beyond

8432
02:39:10,010 --> 02:39:10,020
or even if it didn't expand Beyond
 

8433
02:39:10,020 --> 02:39:10,929
or even if it didn't expand Beyond
Poland

8434
02:39:10,929 --> 02:39:10,939
Poland
 

8435
02:39:10,939 --> 02:39:13,309
Poland
yeah it would be like a footnote it

8436
02:39:13,309 --> 02:39:13,319
yeah it would be like a footnote it
 

8437
02:39:13,319 --> 02:39:14,929
yeah it would be like a footnote it
wasn't many ways a footnote like many of

8438
02:39:14,929 --> 02:39:14,939
wasn't many ways a footnote like many of
 

8439
02:39:14,939 --> 02:39:16,550
wasn't many ways a footnote like many of
the early steps toward it was like they

8440
02:39:16,550 --> 02:39:16,560
the early steps toward it was like they
 

8441
02:39:16,560 --> 02:39:18,050
the early steps toward it was like they
didn't cover it's just like all right

8442
02:39:18,050 --> 02:39:18,060
didn't cover it's just like all right
 

8443
02:39:18,060 --> 02:39:19,190
didn't cover it's just like all right
they're they're being oppressive toward

8479
02:40:01,020 --> 02:40:03,050
how long have you been writing this book
I mean two years mentally it was like

8480
02:40:03,050 --> 02:40:03,060
I mean two years mentally it was like
 

8481
02:40:03,060 --> 02:40:04,969
I mean two years mentally it was like
two years since you spent with the time

8482
02:40:04,969 --> 02:40:04,979
two years since you spent with the time
 

8483
02:40:04,979 --> 02:40:06,410
two years since you spent with the time
with it what um

8484
02:40:06,410 --> 02:40:06,420
with it what um
 

8485
02:40:06,420 --> 02:40:08,870
with it what um
no almost three two and a half yeah

8486
02:40:08,870 --> 02:40:08,880
no almost three two and a half yeah
 

8487
02:40:08,880 --> 02:40:11,150

longer like you said your family
so it in many ways this is a book you've

8492
02:40:16,309 --> 02:40:16,319
so it in many ways this is a book you've
 

8493
02:40:16,319 --> 02:40:18,230
so it in many ways this is a book you've
been writing your whole life I think

8494
02:40:18,230 --> 02:40:18,240
been writing your whole life I think
 

8495
02:40:18,240 --> 02:40:19,550
been writing your whole life I think
that's fair that all my work's been

8496
02:40:19,550 --> 02:40:19,560
that's fair that all my work's been
 

8497
02:40:19,560 --> 02:40:20,929
that's fair that all my work's been
leading to this yeah

8498
02:40:20,929 --> 02:40:20,939

8499
02:40:20,939 --> 02:40:22,610
leading to this yeah
it's certainly the most in my opinion

8500
02:40:22,610 --> 02:40:22,620
it's certainly the most in my opinion
 

8501
02:40:22,620 --> 02:40:25,190
it's certainly the most in my opinion
the most important thing I've done

about it you know in part thanks to kind
 

8523
02:40:48,780 --> 02:40:51,469
about it you know in part thanks to kind
of the North Korean work and coming from

02:40:51,469 --> 02:40:51,479
of the North Korean work and coming from
 

8525
02:40:51,479 --> 02:40:53,389
of the North Korean work and coming from
Ukraine

Ukraine
um the thing that was also kind of

8528
02:40:55,849 --> 02:40:55,859
um the thing that was also kind of
 

8529
02:40:55,859 --> 02:40:57,830
um the thing that was also kind of
insane about it is that they were taking

8530
02:40:57,830 --> 02:40:57,840
insane about it is that they were taking
 

8531
02:40:57,840 --> 02:41:00,410
insane about it is that they were taking
all this grain and not using it even to

8532
02:41:00,410 --> 02:41:00,420
all this grain and not using it even to
 

8533
02:41:00,420 --> 02:41:01,550
all this grain and not using it even to
feed the Russian people they were

8534
02:41:01,550 --> 02:41:01,560
feed the Russian people they were

um
 

8539
02:41:05,100 --> 02:41:10,250
um
yeah I I think what the takeaway there

8540
02:41:10,250 --> 02:41:10,260
yeah I I think what the takeaway there
 

8541
02:41:10,260 --> 02:41:11,990
yeah I I think what the takeaway there
and I think again this is something

8542
02:41:11,990 --> 02:41:12,000
and I think again this is something
 

8543
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:13,730
and I think again this is something
westerners and especially Americans

8544

westerners and especially Americans
 

8545
02:41:13,740 --> 02:41:17,450
westerners and especially Americans
don't appreciate they think that evil

8546
02:41:17,450 --> 02:41:17,460
don't appreciate they think that evil
 

8547
02:41:17,460 --> 02:41:20,150
don't appreciate they think that evil

like a logic to it right and it's like
why would like because it makes no sense

8552
02:41:26,090 --> 02:41:26,100
why would like because it makes no sense

8580
02:41:53,150 --> 02:41:53,160
because it doesn't make sense there's
 

8581
02:41:53,160 --> 02:41:55,190
because it doesn't make sense there's
kind of like well it's probably more the

what I saw in these Villages it's
another thing that I sat you down and

8632
02:42:56,570 --> 02:42:56,580
another thing that I sat you down and

02:43:14,690 --> 02:43:14,700
just looking at the different mechanisms
 

8649
02:43:14,700 --> 02:43:16,550
just looking at the different mechanisms
that made all of this happen so this is

8650

that made all of this happen so this is
 

8651
02:43:16,560 --> 02:43:19,190
that made all of this happen so this is
not just one guy Stalin having a policy

fear
 

8659
02:43:25,260 --> 02:43:26,929
fear
but how do you implement that system of

8660
02:43:26,929 --> 02:43:26,939
but how do you implement that system of
 

8661
02:43:26,939 --> 02:43:27,950
but how do you implement that system of
fear

8662
02:43:27,950 --> 02:43:27,960
fear
 

8663
02:43:27,960 --> 02:43:30,410

10489
03:18:04,560 --> 03:18:07,010
drawing a distinction between the two
systems yeah because uh you know you

10490
03:18:07,010 --> 03:18:07,020
systems yeah because uh you know you
 

10491
03:18:07,020 --> 03:18:08,389
systems yeah because uh you know you
could have like technology you can show

10492
03:18:08,389 --> 03:18:08,399
could have like technology you can show
 

10493
03:18:08,399 --> 03:18:10,309
could have like technology you can show
off technology and so on but you can

10494
03:18:10,309 --> 03:18:10,319
off technology and so on but you can
 

10495
03:18:10,319 --> 03:18:12,230
off technology and so on but you can
kind of sign up write-off Technologies

10496

kind of sign up write-off Technologies
 

10497

kind of sign up write-off Technologies
like okay that's the mechanism

10498
03:18:14,570 --> 03:18:14,580
like okay that's the mechanism
 

10499

then the Russians sent in the tanks but
the point is he certainly was someone

10612
03:20:30,050 --> 03:20:30,060
the point is he certainly was someone
 

10613
03:20:30,060 --> 03:20:32,090
the point is he certainly was someone
who was like all right this this has got

10614
03:20:32,090 --> 03:20:32,100
who was like all right this this has got
 

10615
03:20:32,100 --> 03:20:34,969
who was like all right this this has got
to stop this is just absolutely crazy

10616
03:20:34,969 --> 03:20:34,979
to stop this is just absolutely crazy
 

10617
03:20:34,979 --> 03:20:38,389
to stop this is just absolutely crazy
um Khrushchev and Stalin were not the

10618
03:20:38,389 --> 03:20:38,399
um Khrushchev and Stalin were not the
 

10619
03:20:38,399 --> 03:20:40,490
um Khrushchev and Stalin were not the
same animal at all

10620
03:20:40,490 --> 03:20:40,500
same animal at all
 

10621
03:20:40,500 --> 03:20:44,630
same animal at all
um so I I think the problem with uh

10622
03:20:44,630 --> 03:20:44,640
um so I I think the problem with uh
 

10623
03:20:44,640 --> 03:20:47,330
um so I I think the problem with uh
communism in in the Marxist sense is

10624
03:20:47,330 --> 03:20:47,340
communism in in the Marxist sense is
 

10625
03:20:47,340 --> 03:20:48,889
communism in in the Marxist sense is
that you're going to have an introduced

10626
03:20:48,889 --> 03:20:48,899
that you're going to have an introduced
 

10627
03:20:48,899 --> 03:20:50,690
that you're going to have an introduced
an element of authoritarianism simply

10628
03:20:50,690 --> 03:20:50,700
an element of authoritarianism simply
 

10629
03:20:50,700 --> 03:20:52,309
an element of authoritarianism simply
because you can't have

10630
03:20:52,309 --> 03:20:52,319
because you can't have
 

10631
03:20:52,319 --> 03:20:54,769
because you can't have
um economic planning if I don't have a

10632
03:20:54,769 --> 03:20:54,779
um economic planning if I don't have a
 

10633
03:20:54,779 --> 03:20:56,750
um economic planning if I don't have a
price mechanism I don't know how price

10634
03:20:56,750 --> 03:20:56,760
price mechanism I don't know how price
 

10635
03:20:56,760 --> 03:21:00,650
price mechanism I don't know how price
is what is me knowing as a consumer or a

10636
03:21:00,650 --> 03:21:00,660
is what is me knowing as a consumer or a
 

10637
03:21:00,660 --> 03:21:03,110
is what is me knowing as a consumer or a
producer what should be produced or what

10638
03:21:03,110 --> 03:21:03,120
producer what should be produced or what
 

10639
03:21:03,120 --> 03:21:04,730
producer what should be produced or what
had there's a shortage of as prices

10640
03:21:04,730 --> 03:21:04,740
had there's a shortage of as prices
 

10641
03:21:04,740 --> 03:21:06,710
had there's a shortage of as prices
increase that's a signal that we have a

10642
03:21:06,710 --> 03:21:06,720
increase that's a signal that we have a
 

10643
03:21:06,720 --> 03:21:08,269
increase that's a signal that we have a
shortage here as prices decrease that

10644
03:21:08,269 --> 03:21:08,279
shortage here as prices decrease that
 

10645
03:21:08,279 --> 03:21:10,010
shortage here as prices decrease that
means that there's a surplus here but if

10646
03:21:10,010 --> 03:21:10,020
means that there's a surplus here but if
 

10647
03:21:10,020 --> 03:21:11,510
means that there's a surplus here but if
I'm setting the price I don't really

10648
03:21:11,510 --> 03:21:11,520
I'm setting the price I don't really
 

10649
03:21:11,520 --> 03:21:13,849
I'm setting the price I don't really
have know how much weed I need to

10650
03:21:13,849 --> 03:21:13,859
have know how much weed I need to
 

10651
03:21:13,859 --> 03:21:15,590
have know how much weed I need to
produce if I'm compared to Corn as

10652
03:21:15,590 --> 03:21:15,600
produce if I'm compared to Corn as
 

10653
03:21:15,600 --> 03:21:16,969

compared to shoes as compared to Santa

10654
03:21:16,969 --> 03:21:16,979
compared to shoes as compared to Santa
 

10655
03:21:16,979 --> 03:21:20,389
compared to shoes as compared to Santa
costumes so that is a big problem the

10656
03:21:20,389 --> 03:21:20,399
costumes so that is a big problem the
 

10657
03:21:20,399 --> 03:21:24,050
costumes so that is a big problem the
other issue is if you have one agency

10658
03:21:24,050 --> 03:21:24,060
other issue is if you have one agency
 

10659
03:21:24,060 --> 03:21:26,990
other issue is if you have one agency
the government having a monopoly on

10660

let's suppose the news like you were

10662
03:21:29,269 --> 03:21:29,279
let's suppose the news like you were
 

10663
03:21:29,279 --> 03:21:30,950
let's suppose the news like you were
talking about earlier with Twitter it's

10664
03:21:30,950 --> 03:21:30,960
talking about earlier with Twitter it's
 

10665
03:21:30,960 --> 03:21:32,990
talking about earlier with Twitter it's
going to be really hard to have any kind

10666
03:21:32,990 --> 03:21:33,000
going to be really hard to have any kind
 

10667
03:21:33,000 --> 03:21:36,650
going to be really hard to have any kind
of objective discourse because everyone

10668
03:21:36,650 --> 03:21:36,660
of objective discourse because everyone
 

10669
03:21:36,660 --> 03:21:38,150
of objective discourse because everyone
is going to be working for the same

10670
03:21:38,150 --> 03:21:38,160
is going to be working for the same
 

10671
03:21:38,160 --> 03:21:40,370
is going to be working for the same
organization that is going to cause a

10672
03:21:40,370 --> 03:21:40,380
organization that is going to cause a
 

10673
03:21:40,380 --> 03:21:41,450
organization that is going to cause a
problem in terms of having a feedback

10674
03:21:41,450 --> 03:21:41,460
problem in terms of having a feedback
 

10675
03:21:41,460 --> 03:21:44,330
problem in terms of having a feedback
mechanism even in the best scenario in

10676
03:21:44,330 --> 03:21:44,340
mechanism even in the best scenario in
 

10677
03:21:44,340 --> 03:21:46,610
mechanism even in the best scenario in
terms of this is a problem this isn't a

10678
03:21:46,610 --> 03:21:46,620
terms of this is a problem this isn't a
 

10679
03:21:46,620 --> 03:21:49,250
terms of this is a problem this isn't a
problem and when you have a monopoly

10680
03:21:49,250 --> 03:21:49,260
problem and when you have a monopoly
 

10681
03:21:49,260 --> 03:21:51,170
problem and when you have a monopoly
which is what a government is I think

10682
03:21:51,170 --> 03:21:51,180
which is what a government is I think
 

10683
03:21:51,180 --> 03:21:52,969
which is what a government is I think
people are very familiar with what the

10684
03:21:52,969 --> 03:21:52,979
people are very familiar with what the
 

10685
03:21:52,979 --> 03:21:54,710
people are very familiar with what the
problems happen with Monopoly this lack

10686
03:21:54,710 --> 03:21:54,720
problems happen with Monopoly this lack
 

10687
03:21:54,720 --> 03:21:56,870
problems happen with Monopoly this lack
of accountability bureaucracies are

10688
03:21:56,870 --> 03:21:56,880
of accountability bureaucracies are
 

10689
03:21:56,880 --> 03:21:58,610
of accountability bureaucracies are
faceless and then no one's to blame but

10690
03:21:58,610 --> 03:21:58,620
faceless and then no one's to blame but
 

10691
03:21:58,620 --> 03:22:00,710
faceless and then no one's to blame but
you know uh and yet everyone kind of

10692
03:22:00,710 --> 03:22:00,720
you know uh and yet everyone kind of
 

10693
03:22:00,720 --> 03:22:03,050
you know uh and yet everyone kind of
suffers as a consequence so it doesn't

10694
03:22:03,050 --> 03:22:03,060
suffers as a consequence so it doesn't
 

10695
03:22:03,060 --> 03:22:05,630
suffers as a consequence so it doesn't
necessarily have to be as authoritarian

10696
03:22:05,630 --> 03:22:05,640
necessarily have to be as authoritarian
 

10697
03:22:05,640 --> 03:22:10,309
necessarily have to be as authoritarian
as stalinism but you can't have have it

10698
03:22:10,309 --> 03:22:10,319
as stalinism but you can't have have it
 

10699
03:22:10,319 --> 03:22:12,349
as stalinism but you can't have have it

10710
03:22:23,690 --> 03:22:23,700
you're going to have to make it illegal
 

10711

10716
03:22:29,150 --> 03:22:29,160
and so forth now that might be a price
 

10717
03:22:29,160 --> 03:22:30,769
and so forth now that might be a price

03:34:23,939 --> 03:34:24,830
hope and if things get better oh it
doesn't really matter because the

11328
03:34:24,830 --> 03:34:24,840
doesn't really matter because the
 

11329
03:34:24,840 --> 03:34:26,630
doesn't really matter because the
broader picture never gets better and

11330
03:34:26,630 --> 03:34:26,640
broader picture never gets better and
 

11331
03:34:26,640 --> 03:34:29,150
broader picture never gets better and
there's lots of data to the contrary

11332
03:34:29,150 --> 03:34:29,160
there's lots of data to the contrary
 

11333
03:34:29,160 --> 03:34:30,950
there's lots of data to the contrary
where that's happened before and this

11334
03:34:30,950 --> 03:34:30,960
where that's happened before and this
 

11335
03:34:30,960 --> 03:34:33,469
where that's happened before and this
isn't some magical Faraway place this is

11336
03:34:33,469 --> 03:34:33,479
isn't some magical Faraway place this is
 

11337
03:34:33,479 --> 03:34:35,510
isn't some magical Faraway place this is
the opposite of magical far away place

11338
03:34:35,510 --> 03:34:35,520
the opposite of magical far away place
 

11339
03:34:35,520 --> 03:34:37,309
the opposite of magical far away place
it's Eastern Europe

11340
03:34:37,309 --> 03:34:37,319
it's Eastern Europe
 

11341
03:34:37,319 --> 03:34:40,370
it's Eastern Europe
and to me I think one such narrative

11342
03:34:40,370 --> 03:34:40,380
and to me I think one such narrative
 

11343
03:34:40,380 --> 03:34:43,330
and to me I think one such narrative
that people assume will always be true

11344
03:34:43,330 --> 03:34:43,340
that people assume will always be true
 

11345
03:34:43,340 --> 03:34:45,950
that people assume will always be true
or just to a degree will always be true

11346
03:34:45,950 --> 03:34:45,960
or just to a degree will always be true
 

11347
03:34:45,960 --> 03:34:48,710
or just to a degree will always be true
like in American politics is the extreme

11348
03:34:48,710 --> 03:34:48,720
like in American politics is the extreme
 

11349
03:34:48,720 --> 03:34:50,570
like in American politics is the extreme
levels of division

11350
03:34:50,570 --> 03:34:50,580
levels of division
 

11351
03:34:50,580 --> 03:34:52,849
levels of division
and it seems to me like that too we can

11352
03:34:52,849 --> 03:34:52,859
and it seems to me like that too we can
 

11353
03:34:52,859 --> 03:34:54,469
and it seems to me like that too we can
overcome

11354
03:34:54,469 --> 03:34:54,479
overcome
 

11355
03:34:54,479 --> 03:34:57,410
overcome
uh so the the division in American

11356
03:34:57,410 --> 03:34:57,420
uh so the the division in American
 

11357
03:34:57,420 --> 03:34:58,610
uh so the the division in American
politics that seems to be

11358
03:34:58,610 --> 03:34:58,620
politics that seems to be
 

11359
03:34:58,620 --> 03:35:00,110
politics that seems to be
counterproductive I think that can be

11360
03:35:00,110 --> 03:35:00,120
counterproductive I think that can be
 

11361
03:35:00,120 --> 03:35:01,849
counterproductive I think that can be
overcome

11362
03:35:01,849 --> 03:35:01,859
overcome
 

11363
03:35:01,859 --> 03:35:05,210
overcome
and I think the the division in

11364
03:35:05,210 --> 03:35:05,220
and I think the the division in
 

11365
03:35:05,220 --> 03:35:08,690
and I think the the division in
geopolitics currently with Russia China

11366
03:35:08,690 --> 03:35:08,700
geopolitics currently with Russia China
 

11367
03:35:08,700 --> 03:35:11,990
geopolitics currently with Russia China
and the United States particularly uh

11368
03:35:11,990 --> 03:35:12,000
and the United States particularly uh
 

11369
03:35:12,000 --> 03:35:14,750
and the United States particularly uh
China and the United States can be

11370
03:35:14,750 --> 03:35:14,760
China and the United States can be
 

11371
03:35:14,760 --> 03:35:16,130
China and the United States can be
overcome

11372
03:35:16,130 --> 03:35:16,140
overcome
 

11373
03:35:16,140 --> 03:35:17,690
overcome
and I think that requires great

11374
03:35:17,690 --> 03:35:17,700
and I think that requires great
 

11375
03:35:17,700 --> 03:35:20,389
and I think that requires great
leadership

11376
03:35:20,389 --> 03:35:20,399

 

11377
03:35:20,399 --> 03:35:23,929

that that galvanizes the populace

11378
03:35:23,929 --> 03:35:23,939
that that galvanizes the populace
 

11379
03:35:23,939 --> 03:35:25,969
that that galvanizes the populace
uh to the better angels of their nature

11380
