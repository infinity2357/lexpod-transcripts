was like yeah that probably makes sense
 

463
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,230
was like yeah that probably makes sense
and uh from then on i kind of just

464
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:04,240
and uh from then on i kind of just
 

465
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,830
and uh from then on i kind of just
changed the way i thought about the

466
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:05,840
changed the way i thought about the

it was very frustrating but but
 

665
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,590
it was very frustrating but but
that's what gave me the mentally the the

666
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:35,600
that's what gave me the mentally the the
 

667
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,470
that's what gave me the mentally the the
championship level mentality and then i

668
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:38,480
championship level mentality and then i
 

669
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,030
championship level mentality and then i
became a little bit overconfident

00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:41,040
became a little bit overconfident
 

671
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,350
became a little bit overconfident
because i start beating everybody after

that
 

675
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,509
that
and

676
00:11:45,509 --> 00:11:45,519
and
 

677
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,230
and
i start to believe the hype of people

678
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:48,240
i start to believe the hype of people
 

679
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,670
i start to believe the hype of people

00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:54,880
he's going to be unstoppable and
 

685
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,069
he's going to be unstoppable and

00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:06,480
my first failure was because i had a
 

695
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,829
my first failure was because i had a
lack of confidence

696
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:08,839
lack of confidence
 

697
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:10,550
lack of confidence
and

698
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:10,560
and
 

699
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,110
and
and my second failure was i was because

700
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:13,120

skills in in the world right and and if
 

717
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,269
skills in in the world right and and if
you're uh if you don't have the

00:12:31,269 --> 00:12:31,279
you're uh if you don't have the
 

719
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,670
you're uh if you don't have the
confidence it's like you it's like you

00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:38,720
so so it's that's a little bit the
 

727
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,670
so so it's that's a little bit the
analogy that john told me so that's how

728
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:41,680
analogy that john told me so that's how

i feel confidence plays for an athlete
 

731
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,509
i feel confidence plays for an athlete
but to be overconfident i think it's

732
00:12:45,509 --> 00:12:45,519
but to be overconfident i think it's
 

733
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:46,629
but to be overconfident i think it's
always good to

always good to
 

735

always good to
to be aware to be afraid

to be aware to be afraid
 

737
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,030
to be aware to be afraid
of what can happen

738
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:51,040
of what can happen
 

739
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,910
of what can happen

rational people will recognize when
 

1455
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:50,470
rational people will recognize when
they're failing with given moves and no

1456
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:50,480
they're failing with given moves and no
 

1457
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,470

15 times in a row he tries it over a
 

1467
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,789
15 times in a row he tries it over a
month and all 15 are failures there's

1468
00:25:04,789 --> 00:25:04,799
month and all 15 are failures there's
 

1469
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,230
month and all 15 are failures there's
nothing i can say verbally to come up

1470
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:06,240
nothing i can say verbally to come up
 

1471
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,590
nothing i can say verbally to come up
the goal and say hey you're really good

1472
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:07,600
the goal and say hey you're really good
 

1473
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,789
the goal and say hey you're really good
at that move he's going to look at me

1474
00:25:08,789 --> 00:25:08,799
at that move he's going to look at me
 

1475
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,110
at that move he's going to look at me
and say [\h__\h] i'm terrible at it. and

1476
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:11,120
and say [\h__\h] i'm terrible at it. and
 

1477
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,950
and say [\h__\h] i'm terrible at it. and
that will create a crisis of confidence

1478
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:12,960
that will create a crisis of confidence
 

1479
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,310
that will create a crisis of confidence
where gordon no longer believes the

1480
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:14,320
where gordon no longer believes the
 

1481
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,149
where gordon no longer believes the
words coming out of my mouth

words coming out of my mouth
 

1483
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:17,990
words coming out of my mouth
so i will never compromise that but

1484
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:18,000
so i will never compromise that but
 

1485
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,549
so i will never compromise that but
isn't there a lot you just said 15

1486
00:25:20,549 --> 00:25:20,559
isn't there a lot you just said 15
 

1487
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:23,510
isn't there a lot you just said 15
you have to believe

00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:23,520
you have to believe
 

1489
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,950
you have to believe
that uh

1490
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:24,960
that uh
 

1491
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,269
that uh
doing this arm lock 15 times over a

doing this arm lock 15 times over a
 

1493
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:28,870
doing this arm lock 15 times over a
period of a month is worth it because

1494
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:28,880
period of a month is worth it because
 

1495
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,190
period of a month is worth it because
eventually you might get it like yeah

1496
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:31,200
eventually you might get it like yeah
 

1497
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,950
eventually you might get it like yeah

when i first met gary tonan he never had
a guillotine strangle and i i would say

00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:49,760
a guillotine strangle and i i would say
 

1511
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,029
a guillotine strangle and i i would say
don't gary you know

you're a scrambler like one of the
 

1515
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,390
you're a scrambler like one of the
greatest weapons a scrambler can ever

1516
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:54,400
greatest weapons a scrambler can ever
 

1517
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,549
greatest weapons a scrambler can ever
develop as a guillotine like it should

1518
00:25:56,549 --> 00:25:56,559
develop as a guillotine like it should
 

1519
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,310
develop as a guillotine like it should
be in your arsenal

1520
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:58,320
be in your arsenal
 

1521
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,630
be in your arsenal
and he was like no i just scrambled for

1522
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:00,640
and he was like no i just scrambled for
 

1523
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,070
and he was like no i just scrambled for
the back and i said well there's gonna

1524
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:02,080
the back and i said well there's gonna
 

1525
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,390
the back and i said well there's gonna
be a day you can't take someone's back

1526
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:04,400
be a day you can't take someone's back
 

1527
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,310
be a day you can't take someone's back
and it's always good about a strangle

1528
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:06,320
and it's always good about a strangle
 

1529
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,710
and it's always good about a strangle
from front and back okay of course we

1530
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:08,720
from front and back okay of course we
 

1531
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,310
from front and back okay of course we
all prefer strangles from the bank that

1532
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:10,320
all prefer strangles from the bank that
 

1533
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,630
all prefer strangles from the bank that
makes sense but there's going to come a

1534
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:12,640
makes sense but there's going to come a
 

1535
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,990
makes sense but there's going to come a
day where it's going to be useful for

1536
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:14,000
day where it's going to be useful for
 

1537
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,990
day where it's going to be useful for
you and so that was one of the few times

1538
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:16,000
you and so that was one of the few times
 

1539
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,350
you and so that was one of the few times
where i put my foot down and said you're

1540
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:17,360
where i put my foot down and said you're
 

1541
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,269
where i put my foot down and said you're
learning this shut the [\h__\h] up

1542
00:26:19,269 --> 00:26:19,279
learning this shut the [\h__\h] up
 

1543
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,669
learning this shut the [\h__\h] up
and um uh he like literally wouldn't

1544
00:26:21,669 --> 00:26:21,679
and um uh he like literally wouldn't
 

1545
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:23,750
and um uh he like literally wouldn't
teach him any anything else until he got

1546
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:23,760
teach him any anything else until he got
 

1547
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,029
teach him any anything else until he got
a guilty and you know gary would like

1548
00:26:25,029 --> 00:26:25,039
a guilty and you know gary would like
 

1549
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:26,149
a guilty and you know gary would like
ask him a question he's like let's see

1550
00:26:26,149 --> 00:26:26,159
ask him a question he's like let's see
 

1551
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,789
ask him a question he's like let's see
your guillotine

1552
00:26:28,789 --> 00:26:28,799

 

1553
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:31,590

and um for the first three months

1554
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:31,600
and um for the first three months
 

1555
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,070
and um for the first three months
as gifted as as gary tony is in learning

there was something going on with gary

1562
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:40,080
there was something going on with gary
 

1563
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,710
there was something going on with gary
just couldn't get a guillotine on people

1564
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:42,720
just couldn't get a guillotine on people
 

1565
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,590
just couldn't get a guillotine on people
and uh finally after around three months

1566
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:45,600
and uh finally after around three months
 

1567
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,830

he started having some success until
 

1569
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,110
he started having some success until
ultimately became one of his best

weapons
 

1573
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:52,549
weapons
um we had to go through like 15

1574
00:26:52,549 --> 00:26:52,559
um we had to go through like 15
 

1575
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,950
um we had to go through like 15
different variations of guillotine until

1576
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:54,960
different variations of guillotine until
 

1577
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,630
different variations of guillotine until
he found one which actually worked

1578
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:56,640
he found one which actually worked
 

1579
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,230

reliably for him

1580

reliably for him
 

1581
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,070
reliably for him
and that was one of the few times where

1582
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:00,080
and that was one of the few times where
 

1583
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,149
and that was one of the few times where
i put my foot down and said no

you you have to learn this so the long
 

1587
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,590
you you have to learn this so the long
search had to do more with the physical

1588
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:05,600
search had to do more with the physical
 

1589

out the right like it made sense it made
 

1593
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:10,470
out the right like it made sense it made
sense in the case of gary tony because

1594
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:10,480
sense in the case of gary tony because
 

1595
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,950
sense in the case of gary tony because
there were more opportunities per minute

of his grappling for guillotines uh that
 

1599
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,590
of his grappling for guillotines uh that
the investment in time was worth it for

1600
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:17,600
the investment in time was worth it for
 

1601
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,350
the investment in time was worth it for

00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:20,880
he hardly ever gets in the situation but
 

1605
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,149

it's through emotion
 

1911
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:36,310
it's through emotion
and so when they get a sense that these

1912
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:36,320
and so when they get a sense that these
 

1913
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,389
and so when they get a sense that these
two don't like each other

1914
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:38,399
two don't like each other
 

1915

a difference of opinion on this i think
 

3129
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:29,349
a difference of opinion on this i think
what about strength training and muscle

3130
00:53:29,349 --> 00:53:29,359
what about strength training and muscle
 

3131
00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:31,030
what about strength training and muscle
building or at least we had a discussion

3132

3267
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:57,829
a basic split like a chest and triceps
back and biceps day

00:55:57,829 --> 00:55:57,839
back and biceps day
 

3269
00:55:57,839 --> 00:56:01,510
back and biceps day
and my idea is that

3270
00:56:01,510 --> 00:56:01,520

 

3271
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,109

weightlifting should always be a

3272
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:03,119
weightlifting should always be a
 

3273
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:05,589
weightlifting should always be a
supplement to jiu-jitsu so you shouldn't

3274
00:56:05,589 --> 00:56:05,599
supplement to jiu-jitsu so you shouldn't
 

3275
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:07,910
supplement to jiu-jitsu so you shouldn't
be missing a jiu-jitsu session to lift

3276
00:56:07,910 --> 00:56:07,920
be missing a jiu-jitsu session to lift
 

3277
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:11,109
be missing a jiu-jitsu session to lift
weights um so i don't do i do probably i

3278
00:56:11,109 --> 00:56:11,119
weights um so i don't do i do probably i
 

3279
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:13,349
weights um so i don't do i do probably i
train jiu-jitsu every day and i lift

3280
00:56:13,349 --> 00:56:13,359
train jiu-jitsu every day and i lift
 

3281
00:56:13,359 --> 00:56:15,349
train jiu-jitsu every day and i lift
three to four times a week um i feel

3282
00:56:15,349 --> 00:56:15,359
three to four times a week um i feel
 

3283
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:17,030
three to four times a week um i feel
like lifting seven days a week for me is

3284
00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:17,040
like lifting seven days a week for me is
 

3285
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,789
like lifting seven days a week for me is
is too much and the lifting takes a lot

3286
00:56:18,789 --> 00:56:18,799
is too much and the lifting takes a lot
 

3287
00:56:18,799 --> 00:56:20,150
is too much and the lifting takes a lot
of energy when you do like hard lifts

3288
00:56:20,150 --> 00:56:20,160
of energy when you do like hard lifts
 

3289
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,710
of energy when you do like hard lifts
like that um but my idea is if you want

3290
00:56:22,710 --> 00:56:22,720
like that um but my idea is if you want
 

3291
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:24,710
like that um but my idea is if you want
to get good at jiu jitsu do jiu jitsu

3292
00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:24,720
to get good at jiu jitsu do jiu jitsu
 

3293
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:25,670
to get good at jiu jitsu do jiu jitsu
and if you want to be bigger and

3294
00:56:25,670 --> 00:56:25,680
and if you want to be bigger and
 

3295
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:29,030
and if you want to be bigger and
stronger lift weights and uh and eat

3296
00:56:29,030 --> 00:56:29,040
stronger lift weights and uh and eat
 

3297
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:31,030
stronger lift weights and uh and eat
food and um

3298
00:56:31,030 --> 00:56:31,040
food and um
 

3299
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:33,430
food and um
i i generally don't go super heavy when

3300
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:33,440
i i generally don't go super heavy when
 

3301
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:35,109
i i generally don't go super heavy when
i lift you start putting crazy weights

3302
00:56:35,109 --> 00:56:35,119
i lift you start putting crazy weights
 

3303
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:37,270
i lift you start putting crazy weights
then start tearing muscles and stuff um

3304
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:37,280
then start tearing muscles and stuff um
 

3305
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:38,710
then start tearing muscles and stuff um
so i usually do moderate weights with a

3306
00:56:38,710 --> 00:56:38,720
so i usually do moderate weights with a
 

3307
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:40,630
so i usually do moderate weights with a
with a very high rep rep range like four

3308
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:40,640
with a very high rep rep range like four
 

3309
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,870
with a very high rep rep range like four
sets of 20 with a drop set at the end to

3310
00:56:42,870 --> 00:56:42,880
sets of 20 with a drop set at the end to
 

3311
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:45,589
sets of 20 with a drop set at the end to
fatigue the muscles break the fibers and

3312
00:56:45,589 --> 00:56:45,599
fatigue the muscles break the fibers and
 

3313
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:46,789
fatigue the muscles break the fibers and
grow

3314
00:56:46,789 --> 00:56:46,799
grow
 

3315
00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:47,990
grow
okay so

3316
00:56:47,990 --> 00:56:48,000
okay so
 

3317
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,150
okay so
four sets of 20 that's interesting so

3318
00:56:50,150 --> 00:56:50,160
four sets of 20 that's interesting so
 

3319
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:52,390
four sets of 20 that's interesting so
that that's more for endurance and raw

3320
00:56:52,390 --> 00:56:52,400
that that's more for endurance and raw
 

3321
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,630
that that's more for endurance and raw
strength yeah and also i think

3322
00:56:54,630 --> 00:56:54,640
strength yeah and also i think
 

3323
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:56,150
strength yeah and also i think
close to the competition i'll pick the

3324
00:56:56,150 --> 00:56:56,160
close to the competition i'll pick the
 

3325
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:59,030
close to the competition i'll pick the
intensity up and while there's no real

3326
00:56:59,030 --> 00:56:59,040
intensity up and while there's no real
 

3327
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:02,470
intensity up and while there's no real
way to get significant gains in vo2 max

3328
00:57:02,470 --> 00:57:02,480
way to get significant gains in vo2 max
 

3329
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:04,870
way to get significant gains in vo2 max
i think that lifting and just getting

3330
00:57:04,870 --> 00:57:04,880
i think that lifting and just getting
 

3331
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:07,670
i think that lifting and just getting
used to mentally redlining

3332
00:57:07,670 --> 00:57:07,680
used to mentally redlining
 

3333
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:09,829
used to mentally redlining
gets me kind of in competition shape

3334
00:57:09,829 --> 00:57:09,839
gets me kind of in competition shape
 

3335
00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:11,510
gets me kind of in competition shape
because a lot of times in jiu jitsu the

3336
00:57:11,510 --> 00:57:11,520
because a lot of times in jiu jitsu the
 

3337
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:13,109
because a lot of times in jiu jitsu the
guys i'm training with

3340
00:57:15,349 --> 00:57:15,359
they're not on a technical level where
 

3341
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:16,390
they're not on a technical level where
they can

3342
00:57:16,390 --> 00:57:16,400
they can
 

3343
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:17,910
they can
physically exhaust me to the point where

3344
00:57:17,910 --> 00:57:17,920
physically exhaust me to the point where
 

3345
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:19,270
physically exhaust me to the point where
i feel like i'm gonna die

3346
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:19,280
i feel like i'm gonna die
 

3347
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:21,030
i feel like i'm gonna die
but uh i get most of that like when i'm

3348
00:57:21,030 --> 00:57:21,040
but uh i get most of that like when i'm
 

3349
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,230
but uh i get most of that like when i'm
wrestling because i'm not as efficient

3350
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:22,240
wrestling because i'm not as efficient
 

3351
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:24,630
wrestling because i'm not as efficient
in wrestling so i get a lot more tired

3352
00:57:24,630 --> 00:57:24,640
in wrestling so i get a lot more tired
 

3353
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,630
in wrestling so i get a lot more tired
and lifting when you do like if you do

3354
00:57:26,630 --> 00:57:26,640
and lifting when you do like if you do
 

3355
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:29,190
and lifting when you do like if you do
like four sets of 20 leg press to squat

3356
00:57:29,190 --> 00:57:29,200
like four sets of 20 leg press to squat
 

3357
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,710
like four sets of 20 leg press to squat
and you go back and forth like you're

3358
00:57:30,710 --> 00:57:30,720
and you go back and forth like you're
 

3359
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:33,030
and you go back and forth like you're
like about to die at the end and

3360
00:57:33,030 --> 00:57:33,040
like about to die at the end and
 

3361
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:34,549
like about to die at the end and
i think i feel like gets me in the

3362
00:57:34,549 --> 00:57:34,559
i think i feel like gets me in the
 

3363
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:36,390
i think i feel like gets me in the
mental habit of redlining before

3364
00:57:36,390 --> 00:57:36,400
mental habit of redlining before
 

3365
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:39,109
mental habit of redlining before
competition but does muscle help you

3366
00:57:39,109 --> 00:57:39,119
competition but does muscle help you
 

3367
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:41,589
competition but does muscle help you
it's like the actual mass of muscle

3368
00:57:41,589 --> 00:57:41,599
it's like the actual mass of muscle
 

3369
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:43,430
it's like the actual mass of muscle
like this so i think being stronger will

3370
00:57:43,430 --> 00:57:43,440
like this so i think being stronger will
 

3371
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:45,430
like this so i think being stronger will
always help in a combat will always help

3372
00:57:45,430 --> 00:57:45,440
always help in a combat will always help
 

3373
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:46,549
always help in a combat will always help
yeah

3374
00:57:46,549 --> 00:57:46,559
yeah
 

3375
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:48,390
yeah
to some degree it's not going to be

3376
00:57:48,390 --> 00:57:48,400
to some degree it's not going to be
 

3377
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,390
to some degree it's not going to be
to a degree where

3378
00:57:50,390 --> 00:57:50,400
to a degree where
 

3379
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:53,030
to a degree where
it overrides efficiency but i think that

3380
00:57:53,030 --> 00:57:53,040
it overrides efficiency but i think that
 

3381
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:54,470
it overrides efficiency but i think that
they can't help being strong or can't

3382
00:57:54,470 --> 00:57:54,480
they can't help being strong or can't
 

3383
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,630
they can't help being strong or can't
hurt being stronger well there's a bunch

3384
00:57:56,630 --> 00:57:56,640
hurt being stronger well there's a bunch
 

3385
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:58,309
hurt being stronger well there's a bunch
of people who believe depending on the

3386
00:57:58,309 --> 00:57:58,319
of people who believe depending on the
 

3387
00:57:58,319 --> 00:58:01,510
of people who believe depending on the
sport that um

3388
00:58:01,510 --> 00:58:01,520
sport that um
 

3389
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:04,069
sport that um
strength can quickly become uh

3390
00:58:04,069 --> 00:58:04,079
strength can quickly become uh
 

3391
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:06,069
strength can quickly become uh
that have detrimental effects to

3392
00:58:06,069 --> 00:58:06,079
that have detrimental effects to
 

3393
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:07,270
that have detrimental effects to
efficiency

3394
00:58:07,270 --> 00:58:07,280
efficiency
 

3395
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:09,109
efficiency
i like it i agree with that certain kind

3396
00:58:09,109 --> 00:58:09,119
i like it i agree with that certain kind
 

3397
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:09,750
i like it i agree with that certain kind
of

3398
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:09,760
of
 

3399
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:12,150
of
i mean if strength is purely is like

3400
00:58:12,150 --> 00:58:12,160
i mean if strength is purely is like
 

3401
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:15,030
i mean if strength is purely is like
very cleanly purely applied to the exact

3402
00:58:15,030 --> 00:58:15,040
very cleanly purely applied to the exact
 

3403
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:17,109
very cleanly purely applied to the exact
movements of the sport so in judo the

3404
00:58:17,109 --> 00:58:17,119
movements of the sport so in judo the
 

3405
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:19,910
movements of the sport so in judo the
explosiveness you need is very difficult

3406
00:58:19,910 --> 00:58:19,920
explosiveness you need is very difficult
 

3407
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:21,510
explosiveness you need is very difficult
to replicate in any kind of way except

3408
00:58:21,510 --> 00:58:21,520
to replicate in any kind of way except
 

3409
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:24,150
to replicate in any kind of way except
by doing judo yeah i mean

3410
00:58:24,150 --> 00:58:24,160
by doing judo yeah i mean
 

3411
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:25,510
by doing judo yeah i mean
for us uh

3412
00:58:25,510 --> 00:58:25,520
for us uh
 

3413
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:26,630
for us uh
you always have to understand there's

3414
00:58:26,630 --> 00:58:26,640
you always have to understand there's
 

3415
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:29,349
you always have to understand there's
only so much technique that can overcome

3416
00:58:29,349 --> 00:58:29,359
only so much technique that can overcome
 

3417
00:58:29,359 --> 00:58:30,710
only so much technique that can overcome
a certain amount of strength like if we

3418
00:58:30,710 --> 00:58:30,720
a certain amount of strength like if we
 

3419
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:32,789
a certain amount of strength like if we
all try to fight a silverback gorilla

3420
00:58:32,789 --> 00:58:32,799
all try to fight a silverback gorilla
 

3421
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:34,069
all try to fight a silverback gorilla
it's going to kill us

3422
00:58:34,069 --> 00:58:34,079
it's going to kill us
 

3423
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:36,950
it's going to kill us
um but that that being said um i do

3424
00:58:36,950 --> 00:58:36,960
um but that that being said um i do
 

3425
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:37,910
um but that that being said um i do
think that

3426
00:58:37,910 --> 00:58:37,920
think that
 

3427
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,430
think that
like for example heavyweights are

3428
00:58:39,430 --> 00:58:39,440
like for example heavyweights are
 

3429
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:41,670
like for example heavyweights are
usually the least technical because they

3430
00:58:41,670 --> 00:58:41,680
usually the least technical because they
 

3431
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:44,390
usually the least technical because they
rely on their size and strength to beat

3432
00:58:44,390 --> 00:58:44,400
rely on their size and strength to beat
 

3433
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,309
rely on their size and strength to beat
smaller people um but i think that if

3434
00:58:46,309 --> 00:58:46,319
smaller people um but i think that if
 

3435
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:48,549
smaller people um but i think that if
you stay with this with the discipline

3436
00:58:48,549 --> 00:58:48,559
you stay with this with the discipline
 

3437
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:50,870
you stay with this with the discipline
of doing everything very precise and i

3438
00:58:50,870 --> 00:58:50,880
of doing everything very precise and i
 

3439
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,470
of doing everything very precise and i
train with a lot smaller people most of

3440
00:58:52,470 --> 00:58:52,480
train with a lot smaller people most of
 

3441
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:53,589
train with a lot smaller people most of
the time so

3442
00:58:53,589 --> 00:58:53,599
the time so
 

3443
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:56,069
the time so
i get out of the habit of using uh using

3444
00:58:56,069 --> 00:58:56,079
i get out of the habit of using uh using
 

3445
00:58:56,079 --> 00:58:57,829
i get out of the habit of using uh using
my strength um i think if you're very

3446
00:58:57,829 --> 00:58:57,839
my strength um i think if you're very
 

3447
00:58:57,839 --> 00:58:59,190
my strength um i think if you're very
precise with the way that you train i

3448
00:58:59,190 --> 00:58:59,200
precise with the way that you train i
 

3449
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,829
precise with the way that you train i
think that the extra size and strength

3450
00:59:01,829 --> 00:59:01,839
think that the extra size and strength
 

3451
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:03,829
think that the extra size and strength
can help you quick question how would

3452
00:59:03,829 --> 00:59:03,839
can help you quick question how would
 

3453
00:59:03,839 --> 00:59:07,670
can help you quick question how would
you fight a silverback gorilla

3454
00:59:07,670 --> 00:59:07,680

 

3455
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:09,829

i mean is that which animal do you think

3456
00:59:09,829 --> 00:59:09,839
i mean is that which animal do you think
 

3457
00:59:09,839 --> 00:59:11,270
i mean is that which animal do you think
you can actually defeat that would be

3458
00:59:11,270 --> 00:59:11,280
you can actually defeat that would be
 

3459
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:12,950
you can actually defeat that would be
impressive that most people would say

3460
00:59:12,950 --> 00:59:12,960
impressive that most people would say
 

3461
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:14,069
impressive that most people would say
you can't

3462
00:59:14,069 --> 00:59:14,079
you can't
 

3463
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:16,069
you can't
you know i actually

3464
00:59:16,069 --> 00:59:16,079
you know i actually
 

3465
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:18,069
you know i actually
i don't have an an answer to this i

3466
00:59:18,069 --> 00:59:18,079
i don't have an an answer to this i
 

3467
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:19,990
i don't have an an answer to this i
thought you got to say i want i want i

3468
00:59:19,990 --> 00:59:20,000
thought you got to say i want i want i
 

3469
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,150
thought you got to say i want i want i
want to say that me and john had like a

3470
00:59:22,150 --> 00:59:22,160
want to say that me and john had like a
 

3471
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:24,470

four hour discussion on this one time

3472
00:59:24,470 --> 00:59:24,480
four hour discussion on this one time
 

3473

and he went like this whole dissertation
 

3477
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:30,630
and he went like this whole dissertation
about how like jaguar spin underneath

3478
00:59:30,630 --> 00:59:30,640
about how like jaguar spin underneath
 

3479
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:32,309
about how like jaguar spin underneath
and like baron barambolo silverbacks and

3480
00:59:32,309 --> 00:59:32,319
and like baron barambolo silverbacks and
 

3481
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:33,829
and like baron barambolo silverbacks and
kill them and like rip their rip their

00:59:35,670 --> 00:59:35,680
artery and their legs out it was amazing
 

3485
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:37,430
artery and their legs out it was amazing
i guess okay so before we talk about

3486
00:59:37,430 --> 00:59:37,440
i guess okay so before we talk about
 

3487
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,990
i guess okay so before we talk about
strength john let me ask you what

3488
00:59:39,990 --> 00:59:40,000
strength john let me ask you what
 

3489
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,750
strength john let me ask you what
do you think people would be surprised

3490
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:41,760
do you think people would be surprised
 

3491
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:44,630
do you think people would be surprised
by if two animals faced one of them

3492
00:59:44,630 --> 00:59:44,640
by if two animals faced one of them
 

3493
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:46,470
by if two animals faced one of them
would win and people wouldn't predict

3494
00:59:46,470 --> 00:59:46,480
would win and people wouldn't predict
 

3495
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:47,190
would win and people wouldn't predict
that

3496
00:59:47,190 --> 00:59:47,200
that
 

3497
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:48,470
that
so they would be surprised by the

3498
00:59:48,470 --> 00:59:48,480
so they would be surprised by the
 

3499
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:50,390
so they would be surprised by the
effectiveness of certain animal at

3500
00:59:50,390 --> 00:59:50,400
effectiveness of certain animal at
 

3501
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:51,349
effectiveness of certain animal at
fighting

3502
00:59:51,349 --> 00:59:51,359
fighting
 

3503
00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:53,190
fighting
in the whether it's in the forest in the

3504
00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:53,200
in the whether it's in the forest in the
 

3505
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,270
in the whether it's in the forest in the
jungle so let's

3506
00:59:55,270 --> 00:59:55,280
jungle so let's
 

3507
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:56,789
jungle so let's
slow down

3508
00:59:56,789 --> 00:59:56,799
slow down
 

3509
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:58,150
slow down
so there's two animals of different

3510
00:59:58,150 --> 00:59:58,160
so there's two animals of different
 

3511
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:01,670
so there's two animals of different
species fighting and most people would

3512
01:00:01,670 --> 01:00:01,680
species fighting and most people would
 

3513

so for example the lion gets a lot of
credit for some reason i'm not exactly

01:00:06,789 --> 01:00:06,799
credit for some reason i'm not exactly
 

3519
01:00:06,799 --> 01:00:09,510
credit for some reason i'm not exactly
sure why the king of the jungle

3520
01:00:09,510 --> 01:00:09,520
sure why the king of the jungle
 

3521
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:10,870
sure why the king of the jungle
well

3522
01:00:10,870 --> 01:00:10,880
well
 

3523
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:12,069
well
you know a lot of people told me that

3524
01:00:12,069 --> 01:00:12,079
you know a lot of people told me that
 

3525
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:13,349
you know a lot of people told me that
the lion

3526
01:00:13,349 --> 01:00:13,359
the lion
 

3527
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:15,349
the lion
for example the tiger can

3528
01:00:15,349 --> 01:00:15,359
for example the tiger can
 

3529
01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:17,190
for example the tiger can
be a lion yeah this is one of those

3530
01:00:17,190 --> 01:00:17,200
be a lion yeah this is one of those
 

3531
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:20,230
be a lion yeah this is one of those
age-old debates

3532
01:00:20,230 --> 01:00:20,240

 

3533
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:22,870

in grappling in fighting it feels like

3534
01:00:22,870 --> 01:00:22,880
in grappling in fighting it feels like
 

3535
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:24,470
in grappling in fighting it feels like
some animals use

3536
01:00:24,470 --> 01:00:24,480
some animals use
 

3537
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:25,510
some animals use
teeth

3538
01:00:25,510 --> 01:00:25,520
teeth
 

3539
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:27,030
teeth
and some use

3540
01:00:27,030 --> 01:00:27,040
and some use
 

3541
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:30,390
and some use
other parts of their body also like bear

3542
01:00:30,390 --> 01:00:30,400
other parts of their body also like bear
 

3543
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:33,270
other parts of their body also like bear
actually i don't even know how they

3544
01:00:33,270 --> 01:00:33,280
actually i don't even know how they
 

3545
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:35,990
actually i don't even know how they
they have extraordinarily powerful

3546
01:00:35,990 --> 01:00:36,000
they have extraordinarily powerful
 

3547
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,390
they have extraordinarily powerful
and long claws and in addition they're

3548
01:00:38,390 --> 01:00:38,400
and long claws and in addition they're
 

3549
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:41,109
and long claws and in addition they're
powerful biters as well so i wonder and

3550
01:00:41,109 --> 01:00:41,119
powerful biters as well so i wonder and
 

3551
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:43,030
powerful biters as well so i wonder and
the same with the silverback

3552
01:00:43,030 --> 01:00:43,040
the same with the silverback
 

3553
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:44,710
the same with the silverback
i don't know how much there i love that

3554
01:00:44,710 --> 01:00:44,720
i don't know how much there i love that
 

3555
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:46,390
i don't know how much there i love that

we're having this discussion
we need joe rogan for this discussion i

3558

uh
 

3565
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:53,990
uh
your your question has gone in in about

3566
01:00:53,990 --> 01:00:54,000
your your question has gone in in about
 

3567
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,670
your your question has gone in in about
five different so it started with

3568
01:00:55,670 --> 01:00:55,680
five different so it started with
 

3569
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:58,630
five different so it started with
strength uh and let's go back there

3570
01:00:58,630 --> 01:00:58,640
strength uh and let's go back there
 

3571
01:00:58,640 --> 01:00:59,990
strength uh and let's go back there
which is

3572
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:00,000
which is
 

3573
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,109
which is
do you think

3574
01:01:01,109 --> 01:01:01,119
do you think
 

3575
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:03,030
do you think
for for an athlete and you just let's

3576
01:01:03,030 --> 01:01:03,040
for for an athlete and you just let's
 

3577
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:05,030
for for an athlete and you just let's
let's stick to grappling

3578
01:01:05,030 --> 01:01:05,040
let's stick to grappling
 

3579
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:07,190
let's stick to grappling
uh do you think strike strength is

3580
01:01:07,190 --> 01:01:07,200
uh do you think strike strength is
 

3581
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:09,750
uh do you think strike strength is
helpful or detrimental uh i've always

3582
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:09,760
helpful or detrimental uh i've always
 

3583
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:11,190
helpful or detrimental uh i've always
believed that

3584
01:01:11,190 --> 01:01:11,200
believed that
 

3585
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:12,309
believed that
two things

3586
01:01:12,309 --> 01:01:12,319
two things
 

3587
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:13,750
two things
will

3588
01:01:13,750 --> 01:01:13,760
will
 

3589
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:15,829
will
create whatever

3590
01:01:15,829 --> 01:01:15,839
create whatever
 

3591
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:17,270
create whatever
whatever effectiveness you have in

3592
01:01:17,270 --> 01:01:17,280
whatever effectiveness you have in
 

3593
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:18,950
whatever effectiveness you have in
grappling those are

3594
01:01:18,950 --> 01:01:18,960
grappling those are
 

3595
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:21,990
grappling those are
your skill set and your attributes

3596
01:01:21,990 --> 01:01:22,000
your skill set and your attributes
 

3597
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,990
your skill set and your attributes
and the best athletes are those who

3598
01:01:23,990 --> 01:01:24,000
and the best athletes are those who
 

3599
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,589
and the best athletes are those who
excel in both

3600
01:01:25,589 --> 01:01:25,599
excel in both
 

3601
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:26,789
excel in both
um

3602
01:01:26,789 --> 01:01:26,799
um
 

3603
01:01:26,799 --> 01:01:29,030
um
don't kid yourself if someone gets twice

3604
01:01:29,030 --> 01:01:29,040
don't kid yourself if someone gets twice
 

3605
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:30,950
don't kid yourself if someone gets twice
as strong

3606
01:01:30,950 --> 01:01:30,960
as strong
 

3607
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:32,950
as strong
by some kind of magic potion they're

3608
01:01:32,950 --> 01:01:32,960
by some kind of magic potion they're
 

3609
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:34,950
by some kind of magic potion they're
going to be a more effective grappler if

3610
01:01:34,950 --> 01:01:34,960
going to be a more effective grappler if
 

3611
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:36,069
going to be a more effective grappler if
someone gets

3612
01:01:36,069 --> 01:01:36,079
someone gets
 

3613
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:37,670
someone gets
twice the level of endurance that they

3614
01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:37,680
twice the level of endurance that they
 

3615
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:39,750
twice the level of endurance that they
had previously they will be a more

3616
01:01:39,750 --> 01:01:39,760
had previously they will be a more
 

3617
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:41,589
had previously they will be a more
effective grappler these physical

3618
01:01:41,589 --> 01:01:41,599
effective grappler these physical
 

3619
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:44,950
effective grappler these physical
attributes have a very important outcome

3620
01:01:44,950 --> 01:01:44,960
attributes have a very important outcome
 

3621
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:47,910
attributes have a very important outcome
on the uh sorry a very important effect

3622
01:01:47,910 --> 01:01:47,920
on the uh sorry a very important effect
 

3623
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:49,750
on the uh sorry a very important effect
upon the outcome of matches

3624
01:01:49,750 --> 01:01:49,760
upon the outcome of matches
 

3625
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:51,670
upon the outcome of matches
um it's always a good thing to be

3626
01:01:51,670 --> 01:01:51,680
um it's always a good thing to be
 

3627
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:53,270
um it's always a good thing to be
stronger it's always a good thing to

3628
01:01:53,270 --> 01:01:53,280
stronger it's always a good thing to
 

3629
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:54,950
stronger it's always a good thing to
have better endurance it's always a good

3630
01:01:54,950 --> 01:01:54,960
have better endurance it's always a good
 

3631

thing to have better balance or whatever
 

3633
01:01:57,119 --> 01:02:00,150
thing to have better balance or whatever
other attribute you throw out there um

3634
01:02:00,150 --> 01:02:00,160
other attribute you throw out there um
 

3635
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:02,789
other attribute you throw out there um
gordon's point was okay everyone agrees

3636
01:02:02,789 --> 01:02:02,799
gordon's point was okay everyone agrees
 

3637
01:02:02,799 --> 01:02:05,190
gordon's point was okay everyone agrees
on that but there's a problem in order

3638
01:02:05,190 --> 01:02:05,200
on that but there's a problem in order
 

3639
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:07,510
on that but there's a problem in order
to build these things

3640
01:02:07,510 --> 01:02:07,520
to build these things
 

3641
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:10,309
to build these things
you have to carve into other elements of

3642
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:10,319
you have to carve into other elements of
 

3643
01:02:10,319 --> 01:02:12,230
you have to carve into other elements of
your training regimen and then it

3644
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:12,240
your training regimen and then it
 

3645
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,230
your training regimen and then it
becomes which becomes more important

3646
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:14,240
becomes which becomes more important
 

3647
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:16,470
becomes which becomes more important
increases in strength or increases in

3648
01:02:16,470 --> 01:02:16,480
increases in strength or increases in
 

3649
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:18,950
increases in strength or increases in
skill

3650
01:02:18,950 --> 01:02:18,960

 

3651
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:22,230

there comes a point where investing

3652
01:02:22,230 --> 01:02:22,240
there comes a point where investing
 

3653
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:23,750
there comes a point where investing
in strength training starts to get

3654
01:02:23,750 --> 01:02:23,760
in strength training starts to get
 

3655
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:25,430
in strength training starts to get
diminishing returns

3656
01:02:25,430 --> 01:02:25,440
diminishing returns
 

3657
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:27,029
diminishing returns
i can't tell the difference between

3658
01:02:27,029 --> 01:02:27,039
i can't tell the difference between
 

3659
01:02:27,039 --> 01:02:29,910
i can't tell the difference between
someone who bench presses 300 pounds on

3660
01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:29,920
someone who bench presses 300 pounds on
 

3661
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:31,670
someone who bench presses 300 pounds on
the mat versus someone who bench presses

3662
01:02:31,670 --> 01:02:31,680
the mat versus someone who bench presses
 

3663
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:33,990
the mat versus someone who bench presses
400 pounds but that's a big difference

3664
01:02:33,990 --> 01:02:34,000
400 pounds but that's a big difference
 

3665
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,230
400 pounds but that's a big difference
that's a hundred pound difference and

3666
01:02:36,230 --> 01:02:36,240
that's a hundred pound difference and
 

3667
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:38,069
that's a hundred pound difference and
for an athlete to go from bench pressing

3668
01:02:38,069 --> 01:02:38,079
for an athlete to go from bench pressing
 

3669
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:40,069
for an athlete to go from bench pressing
300 pounds to vulnerable that would

3670
01:02:40,069 --> 01:02:40,079
300 pounds to vulnerable that would
 

3671
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:42,390
300 pounds to vulnerable that would
require a great deal of

3672
01:02:42,390 --> 01:02:42,400
require a great deal of
 

3673
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:45,029
require a great deal of
of training effort and focus

3674
01:02:45,029 --> 01:02:45,039
of training effort and focus
 

3675
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:46,549
of training effort and focus

i felt that the volume was the most
important so it would be anywhere from

01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:11,990
important so it would be anywhere from
like three

01:12:19,750 --> 01:12:19,760
and i think the volume was very
 

4229
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:23,270
and i think the volume was very
important to build the skills

4230
01:12:23,270 --> 01:12:23,280
important to build the skills
 

4231
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:24,709
important to build the skills
where i just

4232
01:12:24,709 --> 01:12:24,719

4233
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:26,630

purple belt the way that i should um so

4236
01:12:28,390 --> 01:12:28,400
purple belt the way that i should um so
 

4237
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:30,310
purple belt the way that i should um so
i think that building the skills

4238
01:12:30,310 --> 01:12:30,320
i think that building the skills
 

4239
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:32,630
i think that building the skills
is uh is super important i think that

4240
01:12:32,630 --> 01:12:32,640
is uh is super important i think that
 

4241
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:35,270
is uh is super important i think that
early on volume is very important

4242
01:12:35,270 --> 01:12:35,280
early on volume is very important
 

4243
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:37,030
early on volume is very important
now that i already have the skills built

4244
01:12:37,030 --> 01:12:37,040
now that i already have the skills built
 

4245
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:39,110
now that i already have the skills built
i think that acquiring more knowledge is

4246
01:12:39,110 --> 01:12:39,120
i think that acquiring more knowledge is
 

4247
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:40,790
i think that acquiring more knowledge is
the most important

4248
01:12:40,790 --> 01:12:40,800
the most important
 

4249
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:43,189
the most important
so i find that if i do

4250
01:12:43,189 --> 01:12:43,199
so i find that if i do
 

4251
01:12:43,199 --> 01:12:45,189
so i find that if i do
so many sessions a day like if i do

4252
01:12:45,189 --> 01:12:45,199
so many sessions a day like if i do
 

4253
01:12:45,199 --> 01:12:46,790
so many sessions a day like if i do
three sessions a day

4254
01:12:46,790 --> 01:12:46,800
three sessions a day
 

4255
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:48,790
three sessions a day
i feel sometimes by the third session

4256
01:12:48,790 --> 01:12:48,800
i feel sometimes by the third session
 

4257
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:51,750
i feel sometimes by the third session
i'm just like so mentally like there's

4258
01:12:51,750 --> 01:12:51,760
i'm just like so mentally like there's
 

4259
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:53,110
i'm just like so mentally like there's
just there's so much information that's

4260
01:12:53,110 --> 01:12:53,120
just there's so much information that's
 

4261
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:54,550
just there's so much information that's
went through my head the first two

4262
01:12:54,550 --> 01:12:54,560
went through my head the first two
 

4263
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:55,910
went through my head the first two
sessions that i feel like i'm not even

4264
01:12:55,910 --> 01:12:55,920
sessions that i feel like i'm not even
 

4265
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:58,229
sessions that i feel like i'm not even
there mentally on the third session

4266
01:12:58,229 --> 01:12:58,239
there mentally on the third session
 

4267
01:12:58,239 --> 01:13:01,430
there mentally on the third session
so i feel like doing less volume now but

4268
01:13:01,430 --> 01:13:01,440
so i feel like doing less volume now but
 

4269
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:04,149
so i feel like doing less volume now but
having more mental clarity per session

4270
01:13:04,149 --> 01:13:04,159
having more mental clarity per session
 

4271
01:13:04,159 --> 01:13:05,590
having more mental clarity per session
is more important because i already have

4272
01:13:05,590 --> 01:13:05,600
is more important because i already have
 

4273
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:08,390
is more important because i already have
the foundational skills acquired

4274

do you um
 

4831
01:22:27,679 --> 01:22:29,350
do you um
i don't mean just the line between what

4832
01:22:29,350 --> 01:22:29,360
i don't mean just the line between what

violence i mean there there seems to be
 

4837
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:34,390
violence i mean there there seems to be
a gray area

4838
01:22:34,390 --> 01:22:34,400
a gray area
 

4839
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:36,070
a gray area
that connects us to

4840
01:22:36,070 --> 01:22:36,080
that connects us to
 

4841
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:38,149
that connects us to
the the evolutionary ancestors

4842
01:22:38,149 --> 01:22:38,159
the the evolutionary ancestors
 

4843
01:22:38,159 --> 01:22:40,229
the the evolutionary ancestors
absolutely yeah yeah i mean i i think

4844
01:22:40,229 --> 01:22:40,239
absolutely yeah yeah i mean i i think
 

4845
01:22:40,239 --> 01:22:41,990
absolutely yeah yeah i mean i i think
there's a deep

4846
01:22:41,990 --> 01:22:42,000
there's a deep
 

4847
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,070
there's a deep
recognition in all of us

4848
01:22:44,070 --> 01:22:44,080
recognition in all of us
 

4849
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:44,950
recognition in all of us
that

4850
01:22:44,950 --> 01:22:44,960
that
 

4851
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:46,790
that
um and this is

4852
01:22:46,790 --> 01:22:46,800
um and this is
 

4853
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:49,430
um and this is
the evidence for this is is so easy to

4854
01:22:49,430 --> 01:22:49,440
the evidence for this is is so easy to
 

4855
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:54,629
the evidence for this is is so easy to
uh to see in in daily life um

4856
01:22:54,629 --> 01:22:54,639

 

4857
01:22:54,639 --> 01:22:56,629

if you're walking down the street

4879
01:23:17,199 --> 01:23:19,270
and you've got to ask yourself why and
of course it's a recognition

4880
01:23:19,270 --> 01:23:19,280
of course it's a recognition
 

4881
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:21,510
of course it's a recognition
that for a significant part of our

4882
01:23:21,510 --> 01:23:21,520
that for a significant part of our

evolutionary history
 

4885
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:25,669

and there's a reason why
 

4927
01:24:10,239 --> 01:24:12,629
and there's a reason why
combat sports have this

combat sports have this
 

4929

01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:57,350
some people will stand more early and
some people could be pushed further back

4974
01:24:57,350 --> 01:24:57,360
some people could be pushed further back
 

4975
01:24:57,360 --> 01:24:59,669
some people could be pushed further back
but everyone's got that line

4976
01:24:59,669 --> 01:24:59,679
but everyone's got that line
 

4977
01:24:59,679 --> 01:25:01,750
but everyone's got that line
beyond which they won't be pushed

4978
01:25:01,750 --> 01:25:01,760
beyond which they won't be pushed
 

4979
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:03,110
beyond which they won't be pushed
and there's some kind of deep

4980
01:25:03,110 --> 01:25:03,120
and there's some kind of deep
 

4981
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:05,189
and there's some kind of deep
recognition in all of us that we have

4982
01:25:05,189 --> 01:25:05,199
recognition in all of us that we have
 

4983
01:25:05,199 --> 01:25:07,750
recognition in all of us that we have
that somewhere within us no matter how

4984
01:25:07,750 --> 01:25:07,760
that somewhere within us no matter how
 

4985
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:10,149
that somewhere within us no matter how
hard we try to bury it or what have you

4986
01:25:10,149 --> 01:25:10,159
hard we try to bury it or what have you
 

4987
01:25:10,159 --> 01:25:11,350
hard we try to bury it or what have you
and that's why i believe there will

4988
01:25:11,350 --> 01:25:11,360
and that's why i believe there will
 

4989

are repulsed by that now i'm
 

5009
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:34,950
are repulsed by that now i'm
i'm sure that as humanity

5010
01:25:34,950 --> 01:25:34,960
i'm sure that as humanity
 

5011
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:36,470
i'm sure that as humanity
improves out into the future that will

5012
01:25:36,470 --> 01:25:36,480
improves out into the future that will
 

5013
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:39,030
improves out into the future that will
become more and more widespread

5014
01:25:39,030 --> 01:25:39,040
become more and more widespread
 

5015
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:41,990
become more and more widespread
but that's not to say we we can't

5016
01:25:41,990 --> 01:25:42,000
but that's not to say we we can't
 

5017
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,550
but that's not to say we we can't
exercise these these

5018
01:25:44,550 --> 01:25:44,560
exercise these these
 

5019
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:47,510
exercise these these
old evolutionary demons inside of us and

5020
01:25:47,510 --> 01:25:47,520
old evolutionary demons inside of us and
 

5021
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:49,350
old evolutionary demons inside of us and
um

5022
01:25:49,350 --> 01:25:49,360
um
 

5023
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:50,390
um
and

5024
01:25:50,390 --> 01:25:50,400
and
 

5025
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:52,070
and
sometimes there are just disputes

5026
01:25:52,070 --> 01:25:52,080
sometimes there are just disputes
 

5027
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:53,910
sometimes there are just disputes
between different people different

cultures different nations where
 

5031
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:58,470
cultures different nations where
ultimately it's going to come to

5032
01:25:58,470 --> 01:25:58,480
ultimately it's going to come to
 

5033
01:25:58,480 --> 01:26:00,310
ultimately it's going to come to
into into a shoving match and that will

5034
01:26:00,310 --> 01:26:00,320
into into a shoving match and that will
 

5035
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:02,149
into into a shoving match and that will
degenerate further into violence there's

5036
01:26:02,149 --> 01:26:02,159
degenerate further into violence there's
 

5037
01:26:02,159 --> 01:26:03,590
degenerate further into violence there's
always going to be

5038
01:26:03,590 --> 01:26:03,600
always going to be
 

5039
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:06,550
always going to be
a need for humans to be able to

5040
01:26:06,550 --> 01:26:06,560
a need for humans to be able to
 

5041
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:09,750
a need for humans to be able to
to uh express themselves

5042
01:26:09,750 --> 01:26:09,760
to uh express themselves
 

5043
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:11,270
to uh express themselves
through violent methods and to use

5044
01:26:11,270 --> 01:26:11,280
through violent methods and to use
 

5045
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:13,590
through violent methods and to use
physical force to get to their their

5046
01:26:13,590 --> 01:26:13,600
physical force to get to their their
 

5047
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:15,590
physical force to get to their their
goals and objectives

5048
01:26:15,590 --> 01:26:15,600
goals and objectives
 

5049
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:16,709
goals and objectives
um

5050
01:26:16,709 --> 01:26:16,719
um
 

5051
01:26:16,719 --> 01:26:18,550
um
our

5052
01:26:18,550 --> 01:26:18,560
our
 

5053
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:20,709
our
our need as humans is always to find a

5054
01:26:20,709 --> 01:26:20,719
our need as humans is always to find a
 

5055
01:26:20,719 --> 01:26:23,030
our need as humans is always to find a
balance between

5056
01:26:23,030 --> 01:26:23,040
balance between
 

5057
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:25,430
balance between
the two forces of conflict and

5058
01:26:25,430 --> 01:26:25,440
the two forces of conflict and
 

5059
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:26,790
the two forces of conflict and
cooperation

5060
01:26:26,790 --> 01:26:26,800
cooperation
 

5061
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:28,870
cooperation
we need cooperation because humans

5062
01:26:28,870 --> 01:26:28,880
we need cooperation because humans
 

5063
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:30,550
we need cooperation because humans
isolated from each other

5064
01:26:30,550 --> 01:26:30,560
isolated from each other
 

5065
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:33,430
isolated from each other
more or less helpless and useless

5066
01:26:33,430 --> 01:26:33,440
more or less helpless and useless
 

5067
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:34,629
more or less helpless and useless
in order to

5068
01:26:34,629 --> 01:26:34,639
in order to
 

5069
01:26:34,639 --> 01:26:37,350
in order to
advance human communities need to build

5070
01:26:37,350 --> 01:26:37,360
advance human communities need to build
 

5071
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:38,629
advance human communities need to build
and grow

5072
01:26:38,629 --> 01:26:38,639
and grow
 

5073
01:26:38,639 --> 01:26:41,430
and grow
and so that sense of cooperation

5074
01:26:41,430 --> 01:26:41,440
and so that sense of cooperation
 

5075
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:43,990
and so that sense of cooperation
occurs in most of our daily lives

5076
01:26:43,990 --> 01:26:44,000
occurs in most of our daily lives
 

5077
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,550
occurs in most of our daily lives
but there will also be irresolvable

5078
01:26:46,550 --> 01:26:46,560
but there will also be irresolvable
 

5079
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:48,629
but there will also be irresolvable
conflicts where physical force has to be

5080
01:26:48,629 --> 01:26:48,639
conflicts where physical force has to be
 

5081
01:26:48,639 --> 01:26:51,510
conflicts where physical force has to be
used to form a resolution and so most

5082
01:26:51,510 --> 01:26:51,520
used to form a resolution and so most
 

5083
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:53,590
used to form a resolution and so most
human beings find themselves

5084
01:26:53,590 --> 01:26:53,600
human beings find themselves
 

5085
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:55,189
human beings find themselves
swinging like a pendulum between

5086
01:26:55,189 --> 01:26:55,199
swinging like a pendulum between
 

5087
01:26:55,199 --> 01:26:57,350
swinging like a pendulum between
conflict and cooperation

5088
01:26:57,350 --> 01:26:57,360
conflict and cooperation
 

5089
01:26:57,360 --> 01:26:59,510
conflict and cooperation
and

5090
01:26:59,510 --> 01:26:59,520
and
 

5091
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:02,709
and
and that is something which

5092
01:27:02,709 --> 01:27:02,719
and that is something which
 

5093
01:27:02,719 --> 01:27:04,390
and that is something which
really gives birth i think to combat

5094
01:27:04,390 --> 01:27:04,400
really gives birth i think to combat
 

5095

basically there's a lot of people
studying is what happened how do we get

5110
01:27:20,629 --> 01:27:20,639
studying is what happened how do we get
 

5111
01:27:20,639 --> 01:27:22,470
studying is what happened how do we get
from apes to humans like what was the

5112
01:27:22,470 --> 01:27:22,480
from apes to humans like what was the
 

5113
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:24,629
from apes to humans like what was the
magic thing right a lot of people

magic thing right a lot of people
attributed to fire and ability to cook

5116
01:27:26,950 --> 01:27:26,960
attributed to fire and ability to cook
 

5117
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:27,990
attributed to fire and ability to cook
meat

5118

meat
 

5119
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,910
meat
there's a lot of different theories

5120
01:27:29,910 --> 01:27:29,920
there's a lot of different theories
 

5121
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:30,870
there's a lot of different theories
so

5122
01:27:30,870 --> 01:27:30,880
so
 

5123
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:34,629
so
he actually um

5124
01:27:34,629 --> 01:27:34,639

 

5125
01:27:34,639 --> 01:27:36,310

his theory

5126
01:27:36,310 --> 01:27:36,320
his theory
 

5127
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:38,310
his theory
how do i describe this is basically that

5128
01:27:38,310 --> 01:27:38,320
how do i describe this is basically that
 

5129
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:41,189
how do i describe this is basically that
that the beta males one

5130
01:27:41,189 --> 01:27:41,199
that the beta males one
 

5131
01:27:41,199 --> 01:27:43,189
that the beta males one
that the the

5132
01:27:43,189 --> 01:27:43,199
that the the
 

5133
01:27:43,199 --> 01:27:44,149
that the the
the

5134
01:27:44,149 --> 01:27:44,159
the
 

5135
01:27:44,159 --> 01:27:46,709
the
apes that were able to cooperate

5136
01:27:46,709 --> 01:27:46,719
apes that were able to cooperate
 

5137
01:27:46,719 --> 01:27:48,709
apes that were able to cooperate
so you you the way you develop

5138
01:27:48,709 --> 01:27:48,719
so you you the way you develop
 

5139
01:27:48,719 --> 01:27:51,430
so you you the way you develop
cooperation is that there's a big bad

5140
01:27:51,430 --> 01:27:51,440
cooperation is that there's a big bad
 

5141
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:52,870
cooperation is that there's a big bad
leader

5142
01:27:52,870 --> 01:27:52,880
leader
 

5143
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:55,910
leader
that uh the the alpha male

5144
01:27:55,910 --> 01:27:55,920
that uh the the alpha male
 

5145
01:27:55,920 --> 01:27:57,590
that uh the the alpha male
that you can only

5146
01:27:57,590 --> 01:27:57,600
that you can only
 

5147
01:27:57,600 --> 01:28:00,149
that you can only
um knock off their throne if you

5148
01:28:00,149 --> 01:28:00,159
um knock off their throne if you
 

5149
01:28:00,159 --> 01:28:03,590
um knock off their throne if you
cooperate and so we built big tribes

5150
01:28:03,590 --> 01:28:03,600
cooperate and so we built big tribes
 

5151
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:05,910
cooperate and so we built big tribes
that just excelled the cooperation by

5152
01:28:05,910 --> 01:28:05,920
that just excelled the cooperation by
 

5153
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:08,390
that just excelled the cooperation by
practicing the overthrowing the leader

5154
01:28:08,390 --> 01:28:08,400
practicing the overthrowing the leader
 

5155
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:09,350
practicing the overthrowing the leader
and so

5156
01:28:09,350 --> 01:28:09,360
and so
 

5157
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:11,750
and so
and anytime an alpha male would rise up

5158
01:28:11,750 --> 01:28:11,760
and anytime an alpha male would rise up
 

5159
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:14,149
and anytime an alpha male would rise up
they would get we would we would uh

5160
01:28:14,149 --> 01:28:14,159
they would get we would we would uh
 

5161
01:28:14,159 --> 01:28:16,070
they would get we would we would uh
develop our skill further and further of

5162
01:28:16,070 --> 01:28:16,080
develop our skill further and further of
 

5163
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:17,430
develop our skill further and further of
cooperation

5164
01:28:17,430 --> 01:28:17,440
cooperation
 

5165
01:28:17,440 --> 01:28:20,470
cooperation
and so we're all just beta males uh the

5166
01:28:20,470 --> 01:28:20,480
and so we're all just beta males uh the
 

5167
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:22,629
and so we're all just beta males uh the
descendants of beta males that's his

5168
01:28:22,629 --> 01:28:22,639
descendants of beta males that's his
 

5169
01:28:22,639 --> 01:28:24,310
descendants of beta males that's his
kind of theory that cooperation is

5170
01:28:24,310 --> 01:28:24,320
kind of theory that cooperation is
 

5171
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:27,189
kind of theory that cooperation is
fundamental and it's so distinct to the

5172
01:28:27,189 --> 01:28:27,199
fundamental and it's so distinct to the
 

5173
01:28:27,199 --> 01:28:28,550
fundamental and it's so distinct to the
the rest of the

5174
01:28:28,550 --> 01:28:28,560
the rest of the
 

5175
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:30,870
the rest of the
neighboring animal kingdom

5176
01:28:30,870 --> 01:28:30,880
neighboring animal kingdom
 

5177
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:33,350
neighboring animal kingdom
so fascinating i i wonder what you think

5178
01:28:33,350 --> 01:28:33,360
so fascinating i i wonder what you think
 

5179
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:34,950
so fascinating i i wonder what you think
about this tension of violence and

5180
01:28:34,950 --> 01:28:34,960
about this tension of violence and
 

5181
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:36,550
about this tension of violence and
cooperation how important is this

5182
01:28:36,550 --> 01:28:36,560
cooperation how important is this
 

5183
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:39,590
cooperation how important is this
cooperation to the core of yeah uh

5184
01:28:39,590 --> 01:28:39,600
cooperation to the core of yeah uh
 

5185
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:42,310
cooperation to the core of yeah uh
if you you can look at it in the uh in a

5186
01:28:42,310 --> 01:28:42,320
if you you can look at it in the uh in a
 

5187
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:44,950
if you you can look at it in the uh in a
given training room um

5188
01:28:44,950 --> 01:28:44,960

physically dominates but we do on the

physically dominates but we do on the
 

5263
01:30:04,639 --> 01:30:08,229
physically dominates but we do on the
other hand have our own version of alpha

5264
01:30:08,229 --> 01:30:08,239
other hand have our own version of alpha
 

5265
01:30:08,239 --> 01:30:09,830
other hand have our own version of alpha
males as far as we have political and

5266
01:30:09,830 --> 01:30:09,840
males as far as we have political and

5273
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:23,030

so was the cooperation allowed us to

5274
01:30:23,030 --> 01:30:23,040
so was the cooperation allowed us to
 

5275
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:25,510
so was the cooperation allowed us to
to have a greater scale of hierarchy

5276
01:30:25,510 --> 01:30:25,520
to have a greater scale of hierarchy
 

5277
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:27,910
to have a greater scale of hierarchy
with the alpha male on top or the alpha

5278
01:30:27,910 --> 01:30:27,920
with the alpha male on top or the alpha
 

5279
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:30,229
with the alpha male on top or the alpha
creature on top yeah yeah

5280
01:30:30,229 --> 01:30:30,239
creature on top yeah yeah
 

5281
01:30:30,239 --> 01:30:33,590
creature on top yeah yeah
no that's a fascinating theory

5282
01:30:33,590 --> 01:30:33,600
no that's a fascinating theory
 

5283
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:36,870
no that's a fascinating theory
okay in in nature were were very weak as

5284
01:30:36,870 --> 01:30:36,880
okay in in nature were were very weak as
 

5285
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:38,870
okay in in nature were were very weak as
a species so we needed to cooperate

5286
01:30:38,870 --> 01:30:38,880
a species so we needed to cooperate
 

5287
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:41,030
a species so we needed to cooperate
cooperate in order to

5288
01:30:41,030 --> 01:30:41,040
cooperate in order to
 

5289
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:43,990
cooperate in order to
to evolve that i think

5290
01:30:43,990 --> 01:30:44,000
to evolve that i think
 

5291
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:45,750
to evolve that i think
made us uh the

5292
01:30:45,750 --> 01:30:45,760
made us uh the
 

5293
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:49,750
made us uh the
top of the food chain if you look at um

5294
01:30:49,750 --> 01:30:49,760
top of the food chain if you look at um
 

5295
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:52,470
top of the food chain if you look at um
humanity in in nature

5296
01:30:52,470 --> 01:30:52,480
humanity in in nature
 

5297
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:56,470
humanity in in nature
really the two things that seem to

5298
01:30:56,470 --> 01:30:56,480

 

5299
01:30:56,480 --> 01:30:58,229

more than anything else determine

5300
01:30:58,229 --> 01:30:58,239
more than anything else determine
 

5301
01:30:58,239 --> 01:31:00,470
more than anything else determine
whether or not a given human community

5302
01:31:00,470 --> 01:31:00,480
whether or not a given human community
 

5303
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:01,750
whether or not a given human community
will be

numbers and technology
 

5309
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:08,229
numbers and technology
okay the more your numbers increase and

5310
01:31:08,229 --> 01:31:08,239
okay the more your numbers increase and
 

5311
01:31:08,239 --> 01:31:10,149
okay the more your numbers increase and
then the higher the technology of the

5312
01:31:10,149 --> 01:31:10,159
then the higher the technology of the
 

5313
01:31:10,159 --> 01:31:12,310
then the higher the technology of the
weapons and support systems you have

01:33:45,350 --> 01:33:45,360
different rule sets that somehow
 

5469
01:33:45,360 --> 01:33:47,270
different rule sets that somehow
fundamentally chan challenge that

5470
01:33:47,270 --> 01:33:47,280
fundamentally chan challenge that
 

5471
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:49,669
fundamentally chan challenge that

you've you've got kinetic energy which

5482
01:34:00,070 --> 01:34:00,080
you've you've got kinetic energy which
 

5483
01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:01,910
you've you've got kinetic energy which
is done through striking

5484

is done through striking
 

5485
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:05,189

isometric tension used along the lines

5490
01:34:10,070 --> 01:34:10,080
isometric tension used along the lines
 

5491
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:11,189
isometric tension used along the lines
of

5492
01:34:11,189 --> 01:34:11,199
of
 

5493
01:34:11,199 --> 01:34:12,870

lever and fulcrum
 

5495
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:15,030
lever and fulcrum
which can be used for strangulation and

5496
01:34:15,030 --> 01:34:15,040
which can be used for strangulation and
 

5497
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:17,669
which can be used for strangulation and
joint braking

5498

joint braking
 

5499
01:34:17,679 --> 01:34:19,910
joint braking
in grappling you lose one of those

5500
01:34:19,910 --> 01:34:19,920
in grappling you lose one of those
 

5501
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:21,110
in grappling you lose one of those
you're no longer allowed to hurt your

5502
01:34:21,110 --> 01:34:21,120
you're no longer allowed to hurt your
 

5503
01:34:21,120 --> 01:34:22,629
you're no longer allowed to hurt your
opponent with kinetic energy you can do

5504
01:34:22,629 --> 01:34:22,639
opponent with kinetic energy you can do
 

5505
01:34:22,639 --> 01:34:24,149
opponent with kinetic energy you can do
it accidentally through a throw but

5506
01:34:24,149 --> 01:34:24,159
it accidentally through a throw but
 

5507
01:34:24,159 --> 01:34:26,310
it accidentally through a throw but
you're not allowed to just

5508

you know knock someone out with a throw

5510
01:34:27,669 --> 01:34:27,679
you know knock someone out with a throw
 

5511
01:34:27,679 --> 01:34:29,830
you know knock someone out with a throw
in most grappling spots it can happen

5512
01:34:29,830 --> 01:34:29,840
in most grappling spots it can happen
 

5513
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:31,830
in most grappling spots it can happen
but it's relatively rare and it's it's

5514
01:34:31,830 --> 01:34:31,840
but it's relatively rare and it's it's
 

5515
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:33,830
but it's relatively rare and it's it's
not encouraged by the rule set

5516
01:34:33,830 --> 01:34:33,840
not encouraged by the rule set
 

5517
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:37,590
not encouraged by the rule set
so um cyborg with uh

5518
01:34:37,590 --> 01:34:37,600

 

5519
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:40,709

yeah he got close um uh

5520
01:34:40,709 --> 01:34:40,719
yeah he got close um uh
 

5521
01:34:40,719 --> 01:34:42,149
yeah he got close um uh
so

5522
01:34:42,149 --> 01:34:42,159
so
 

5523
01:34:42,159 --> 01:34:43,430
so
there's a sense in which in mixed

5524
01:34:43,430 --> 01:34:43,440
there's a sense in which in mixed
 

5525
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:45,270
there's a sense in which in mixed
martial arts you got twice as many

5526
01:34:45,270 --> 01:34:45,280
martial arts you got twice as many
 

5527
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:46,790
martial arts you got twice as many
problems to deal with

5528
01:34:46,790 --> 01:34:46,800
problems to deal with
 

5529
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:48,310
problems to deal with
and

5530
01:34:48,310 --> 01:34:48,320
and
 

5531
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:49,669
and
and they occur

5532
01:34:49,669 --> 01:34:49,679
and they occur
 

5533
01:34:49,679 --> 01:34:51,189
and they occur
in

5534
01:34:51,189 --> 01:34:51,199
in
 

5535
01:34:51,199 --> 01:34:53,910
in
a much shorter time frame the single

5536
01:34:53,910 --> 01:34:53,920
a much shorter time frame the single
 

5537
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:56,149
a much shorter time frame the single
biggest difference between grappling

5538
01:34:56,149 --> 01:34:56,159
biggest difference between grappling
 

5539
01:34:56,159 --> 01:34:58,149
biggest difference between grappling
technique as a weapon

5540
01:34:58,149 --> 01:34:58,159
technique as a weapon
 

5541
01:34:58,159 --> 01:35:00,149
technique as a weapon
in human combat versus striking

5542
01:35:00,149 --> 01:35:00,159
in human combat versus striking
 

5543
01:35:00,159 --> 01:35:01,750
in human combat versus striking
technique is time

5544
01:35:01,750 --> 01:35:01,760
technique is time
 

5545
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:03,750
technique is time
grappling technique takes a huge amount

5546
01:35:03,750 --> 01:35:03,760
grappling technique takes a huge amount
 

5547
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:05,590
grappling technique takes a huge amount
of time to apply

5548
01:35:05,590 --> 01:35:05,600
of time to apply
 

5549
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:06,390
of time to apply
okay

5550
01:35:06,390 --> 01:35:06,400
okay
 

5551
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:07,830
okay
the great advantage of grappling

5552
01:35:07,830 --> 01:35:07,840
the great advantage of grappling
 

5553
01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:09,990
the great advantage of grappling
technique is certainty of outcome once

5554
01:35:09,990 --> 01:35:10,000
technique is certainty of outcome once
 

5555
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:11,669
technique is certainty of outcome once
you get there

5556
01:35:11,669 --> 01:35:11,679
you get there
 

5557
01:35:11,679 --> 01:35:14,390
you get there
it takes a huge amount of time to

5558
01:35:14,390 --> 01:35:14,400
it takes a huge amount of time to
 

5559
01:35:14,400 --> 01:35:16,149
it takes a huge amount of time to
set up a takedown

5560
01:35:16,149 --> 01:35:16,159
set up a takedown
 

5561
01:35:16,159 --> 01:35:18,229
set up a takedown
physically take them down

work their way work your way towards a
dominant position culminating in your

01:35:22,629 --> 01:35:22,639
dominant position culminating in your
 

5567
01:35:22,639 --> 01:35:24,229
dominant position culminating in your
opponent's back and then apply a

5568
01:35:24,229 --> 01:35:24,239
opponent's back and then apply a
 

5569
01:35:24,239 --> 01:35:26,550
opponent's back and then apply a
stranglehold that's a long chain of

5570
01:35:26,550 --> 01:35:26,560
stranglehold that's a long chain of
 

5571
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:27,669
stranglehold that's a long chain of
events

5572
01:35:27,669 --> 01:35:27,679
events
 

5573
01:35:27,679 --> 01:35:30,870
events
as opposed to

5574
01:35:30,870 --> 01:35:30,880

 

5575
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:33,430

a strong punch or kick which can take a

5576
01:35:33,430 --> 01:35:33,440
a strong punch or kick which can take a
 

5577
01:35:33,440 --> 01:35:35,030
a strong punch or kick which can take a
quarter of a second an application from

5578
01:35:35,030 --> 01:35:35,040
quarter of a second an application from
 

5579
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:37,750
quarter of a second an application from
start to finish and the match is over

5580
01:35:37,750 --> 01:35:37,760
start to finish and the match is over
 

5581
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:39,189
start to finish and the match is over
um

5582
01:35:39,189 --> 01:35:39,199
um
 

5583
01:35:39,199 --> 01:35:40,310
um
and so

5584
01:35:40,310 --> 01:35:40,320
and so
 

5585
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:43,910
and so
there's a sense in which uh grappling is

5586
01:35:43,910 --> 01:35:43,920
there's a sense in which uh grappling is
 

5587
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:44,870
there's a sense in which uh grappling is
is

5588
01:35:44,870 --> 01:35:44,880
is
 

5589
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:46,629
is
it's

5590
01:35:46,629 --> 01:35:46,639
it's
 

5591
01:35:46,639 --> 01:35:48,790
it's
it's fighting for the patient and the

5592
01:35:48,790 --> 01:35:48,800
it's fighting for the patient and the
 

5593
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:50,550
it's fighting for the patient and the
calculating

5594
01:35:50,550 --> 01:35:50,560
calculating
 

5595
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:52,229
calculating
whereas striking

5596
01:35:52,229 --> 01:35:52,239
whereas striking
 

5597
01:35:52,239 --> 01:35:54,390
whereas striking
is much more for

5598
01:35:54,390 --> 01:35:54,400
is much more for
 

5599
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:56,310
is much more for
in this short time frame where

5600
01:35:56,310 --> 01:35:56,320
in this short time frame where
 

5601
01:35:56,320 --> 01:35:58,149
in this short time frame where
everything gets done and

5602
01:35:58,149 --> 01:35:58,159
everything gets done and
 

5603
01:35:58,159 --> 01:36:00,149
everything gets done and
in the blink of an eye there's a sense

5604
01:36:00,149 --> 01:36:00,159
in the blink of an eye there's a sense
 

5605
01:36:00,159 --> 01:36:01,910
in the blink of an eye there's a sense
also in which grappling is a much more

5606
01:36:01,910 --> 01:36:01,920
also in which grappling is a much more
 

5607
01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:04,870
also in which grappling is a much more
forgiving sport you can make a terrible

5608
01:36:04,870 --> 01:36:04,880
forgiving sport you can make a terrible
 

5609
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:06,229
forgiving sport you can make a terrible
mistake

5610
01:36:06,229 --> 01:36:06,239
mistake
 

5611
01:36:06,239 --> 01:36:08,470
mistake
end up in a terrible position and still

5612
01:36:08,470 --> 01:36:08,480
end up in a terrible position and still
 

5613
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:11,350
end up in a terrible position and still
fight your way out and win

5614
01:36:11,350 --> 01:36:11,360
fight your way out and win
 

5615
01:36:11,360 --> 01:36:13,750
fight your way out and win
in mixed martial arts it's

5616
01:36:13,750 --> 01:36:13,760
in mixed martial arts it's
 

5617
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:16,629
in mixed martial arts it's
much much less forgiving

5618
01:36:16,629 --> 01:36:16,639
much much less forgiving
 

5619
01:36:16,639 --> 01:36:19,030
much much less forgiving
if you get hit and stunned your chances

5620
01:36:19,030 --> 01:36:19,040
if you get hit and stunned your chances
 

5621
01:36:19,040 --> 01:36:21,590
if you get hit and stunned your chances
of recovery are minimal you're going to

5622
01:36:21,590 --> 01:36:21,600
of recovery are minimal you're going to
 

5623
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:23,669
of recovery are minimal you're going to
get swarmed on and unless it's right at

5624
01:36:23,669 --> 01:36:23,679
get swarmed on and unless it's right at
 

5625
01:36:23,679 --> 01:36:25,750
get swarmed on and unless it's right at
the end of the round you it's very very

5626
01:36:25,750 --> 01:36:25,760
the end of the round you it's very very
 

5627
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:27,990
the end of the round you it's very very
hard to recover from getting hit and

5628
01:36:27,990 --> 01:36:28,000
hard to recover from getting hit and
 

5629
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:29,350
hard to recover from getting hit and
swarmed on

5630

um
 

5633
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:32,950
um
so there's a sense in which

5634
01:36:32,950 --> 01:36:32,960
so there's a sense in which
 

5635
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:34,390
so there's a sense in which
the biggest difference between them is

5636
01:36:34,390 --> 01:36:34,400
the biggest difference between them is
 

5637
01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:37,189
the biggest difference between them is
time for application of technique

5638
01:36:37,189 --> 01:36:37,199
time for application of technique
 

5639
01:36:37,199 --> 01:36:39,510
time for application of technique
in mixed martial arts it's incredibly

unforgiving in terms of time even the
 

5643
01:36:41,679 --> 01:36:43,510
unforgiving in terms of time even the
smallest error can have the deepest

5644
01:36:43,510 --> 01:36:43,520
smallest error can have the deepest
 

5645
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:44,870
smallest error can have the deepest
consequences

5646
01:36:44,870 --> 01:36:44,880
consequences
 

5647
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:46,950
consequences
in grappling you can make massive errors

5648
01:36:46,950 --> 01:36:46,960
in grappling you can make massive errors
 

5649
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:48,950
in grappling you can make massive errors
and still come back and win

5650
01:36:48,950 --> 01:36:48,960
and still come back and win

and finish him five minutes later it's
not going to happen in mma

not going to happen in mma
 

5689
01:37:30,639 --> 01:37:33,189
not going to happen in mma
okay so the the stakes so much higher

5690
01:37:33,189 --> 01:37:33,199
okay so the the stakes so much higher
 

5691
01:37:33,199 --> 01:37:34,470
okay so the the stakes so much higher
you could do a lot of damage in a very

5692
01:37:34,470 --> 01:37:34,480
you could do a lot of damage in a very
 

5693
01:37:34,480 --> 01:37:35,910
you could do a lot of damage in a very
small amount of time and just the

01:37:35,910 --> 01:37:35,920
small amount of time and just the
 

5695
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:37,590
small amount of time and just the
dynamic the temporal dynamics of how

dynamic the temporal dynamics of how
 

5697
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:39,350
dynamic the temporal dynamics of how
things happen is very different

everything you'll see will be a
 

5701
01:37:40,639 --> 01:37:42,310
everything you'll see will be a
reflection of that then you go further

5702
01:37:42,310 --> 01:37:42,320
reflection of that then you go further
 

5703
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:44,629
reflection of that then you go further
into things like rule sets

grappling is ground-centered mma is

grappling is ground-centered mma is
 

5727
01:38:07,199 --> 01:38:08,709
grappling is ground-centered mma is
typically standing centered at the

5728
01:38:08,709 --> 01:38:08,719
typically standing centered at the
 

5729
01:38:08,719 --> 01:38:10,229
typically standing centered at the
beginning of every round you have to

5730
01:38:10,229 --> 01:38:10,239
beginning of every round you have to
 

5731
01:38:10,239 --> 01:38:13,750
beginning of every round you have to
start standing again if i disengage from

01:38:13,750 --> 01:38:13,760
start standing again if i disengage from
 

5733
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:16,390
start standing again if i disengage from
a ground grappling situation stand up

5734
01:38:16,390 --> 01:38:16,400
a ground grappling situation stand up
 

5735
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:17,669
a ground grappling situation stand up
and walk away from my opponent my

5736
01:38:17,669 --> 01:38:17,679
and walk away from my opponent my
 

5737
01:38:17,679 --> 01:38:20,790
and walk away from my opponent my
opponent must follow me up to the feet

5738
01:38:20,790 --> 01:38:20,800
opponent must follow me up to the feet
 

5739
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:22,629
opponent must follow me up to the feet
in grappling it's the exact opposite if

5740
01:38:22,629 --> 01:38:22,639
in grappling it's the exact opposite if
 

5741
01:38:22,639 --> 01:38:24,709
in grappling it's the exact opposite if
i sit to the ground my opponent must

5742
01:38:24,709 --> 01:38:24,719
i sit to the ground my opponent must
 

5743
01:38:24,719 --> 01:38:26,470
i sit to the ground my opponent must
follow me to the ground it's written

5744
01:38:26,470 --> 01:38:26,480
follow me to the ground it's written
 

5745
01:38:26,480 --> 01:38:28,310
follow me to the ground it's written
into the rule set and so one is

5746
01:38:28,310 --> 01:38:28,320
into the rule set and so one is
 

5747
01:38:28,320 --> 01:38:30,149
into the rule set and so one is
inherently ground oriented and one is

5748
01:38:30,149 --> 01:38:30,159
inherently ground oriented and one is
 

5749
01:38:30,159 --> 01:38:32,229
inherently ground oriented and one is
inherently standing oriented so it's

5750
01:38:32,229 --> 01:38:32,239
inherently standing oriented so it's
 

5751
01:38:32,239 --> 01:38:33,669
inherently standing oriented so it's
more it's more difficult to dictate

5752
01:38:33,669 --> 01:38:33,679
more it's more difficult to dictate
 

5753
01:38:33,679 --> 01:38:35,669
more it's more difficult to dictate
where the fight happens in mixed martial

01:38:35,679 --> 01:38:37,830
where the fight happens in mixed martial
arts yes you have to be able to impose

5756
01:38:37,830 --> 01:38:37,840
arts yes you have to be able to impose
 

5757
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:39,830
arts yes you have to be able to impose
where the fight is whereas in grappling

5758
01:38:39,830 --> 01:38:39,840
where the fight is whereas in grappling
 

5759
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:41,669
where the fight is whereas in grappling
you can simply choose it

5760
01:38:41,669 --> 01:38:41,679
you can simply choose it
 

5761
01:38:41,679 --> 01:38:42,390
you can simply choose it
so

5762
01:38:42,390 --> 01:38:42,400
so
 

5763
01:38:42,400 --> 01:38:45,109
so
george what is uh your sense of the the

5764
01:38:45,109 --> 01:38:45,119
george what is uh your sense of the the
 

5765
01:38:45,119 --> 01:38:46,310
george what is uh your sense of the the
difference in terms of how you

5766
01:38:46,310 --> 01:38:46,320
difference in terms of how you
 

5767
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:47,669
difference in terms of how you
approached it

5768
01:38:47,669 --> 01:38:47,679
approached it
 

5769
01:38:47,679 --> 01:38:50,470
approached it
uh between the two sports so you also

5770
01:38:50,470 --> 01:38:50,480
uh between the two sports so you also
 

5771
01:38:50,480 --> 01:38:53,430
uh between the two sports so you also
are a student of wrestling and grappling

5772

01:38:56,790 --> 01:38:56,800
so in preparing for fights
 

5775
01:38:56,800 --> 01:38:59,669
so in preparing for fights
what parts of grappling purely the sport

what about you gordon what um
 

5855
01:40:24,159 --> 01:40:25,669
what about you gordon what um
you know what do you think is very

distinct about grappling in the way you

01:40:27,669 --> 01:40:27,679
distinct about grappling in the way you
 

5859
01:40:27,679 --> 01:40:30,149
distinct about grappling in the way you
approach it versus fighting i think most

5860
01:40:30,149 --> 01:40:30,159
approach it versus fighting i think most
 

5861
01:40:30,159 --> 01:40:31,350
approach it versus fighting i think most
of it was covered but i think that

5862
01:40:31,350 --> 01:40:31,360
of it was covered but i think that
 

5863
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:34,070
of it was covered but i think that
though the one one of the big things is

5864
01:40:34,070 --> 01:40:34,080
though the one one of the big things is
 

5865
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:36,870
though the one one of the big things is
the fact that when you're looking at mma

5866
01:40:36,870 --> 01:40:36,880
the fact that when you're looking at mma
 

5867
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:39,030
the fact that when you're looking at mma
you have a pretty general agreed-upon

5868
01:40:39,030 --> 01:40:39,040
you have a pretty general agreed-upon
 

5869
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:41,350
you have a pretty general agreed-upon
and unified rule set where

5870
01:40:41,350 --> 01:40:41,360
and unified rule set where
 

5871
01:40:41,360 --> 01:40:43,910
and unified rule set where
if you look at ufc versus bellator there

5872
01:40:43,910 --> 01:40:43,920
if you look at ufc versus bellator there
 

5873
01:40:43,920 --> 01:40:45,109
if you look at ufc versus bellator there
they have slight differences in the

5874
01:40:45,109 --> 01:40:45,119
they have slight differences in the
 

5875
01:40:45,119 --> 01:40:47,669
they have slight differences in the
rules maybe um but it's pretty much the

5876
01:40:47,669 --> 01:40:47,679
rules maybe um but it's pretty much the
 

5877
01:40:47,679 --> 01:40:50,149
rules maybe um but it's pretty much the
same thing whereas in grappling you have

5878
01:40:50,149 --> 01:40:50,159
same thing whereas in grappling you have
 

5879
01:40:50,159 --> 01:40:52,149
same thing whereas in grappling you have
ebi rules then you have adcc rules you

5880
01:40:52,149 --> 01:40:52,159
ebi rules then you have adcc rules you
 

5881
01:40:52,159 --> 01:40:54,070
ebi rules then you have adcc rules you
have ib gf rules you have no time limit

5882
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:54,080
have ib gf rules you have no time limit
 

5883
01:40:54,080 --> 01:40:55,030
have ib gf rules you have no time limit
rules

5884
01:40:55,030 --> 01:40:55,040
rules
 

5885
01:40:55,040 --> 01:40:55,990
rules
and

5886
01:40:55,990 --> 01:40:56,000
and
 

5887
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,790
and
each rule set will play to the skills of

5888
01:40:58,790 --> 01:40:58,800
each rule set will play to the skills of
 

5889
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:00,550
each rule set will play to the skills of
different athletes

5890
01:41:00,550 --> 01:41:00,560
different athletes
 

5891
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:03,270
different athletes
if you have if you do adcc rules

5892
01:41:03,270 --> 01:41:03,280
if you have if you do adcc rules
 

5893
01:41:03,280 --> 01:41:05,350
if you have if you do adcc rules
it generally is slightly biased towards

5894
01:41:05,350 --> 01:41:05,360
it generally is slightly biased towards
 

5895
01:41:05,360 --> 01:41:07,030
it generally is slightly biased towards
wrestlers or if they can stall to the

5896
01:41:07,030 --> 01:41:07,040
wrestlers or if they can stall to the
 

5897
01:41:07,040 --> 01:41:08,229
wrestlers or if they can stall to the
overtime

5898
01:41:08,229 --> 01:41:08,239
overtime
 

5899
01:41:08,239 --> 01:41:10,790
overtime
and then hit a takedown in the overtime

5900
01:41:10,790 --> 01:41:10,800
and then hit a takedown in the overtime
 

5901
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:12,310
and then hit a takedown in the overtime
and not really do any jujitsu but they

5902
01:41:12,310 --> 01:41:12,320
and not really do any jujitsu but they
 

5903
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:14,149
and not really do any jujitsu but they
score a takedown they're going to win

5904
01:41:14,149 --> 01:41:14,159
score a takedown they're going to win
 

5905
01:41:14,159 --> 01:41:15,669
score a takedown they're going to win
whereas if you have like an ebi for

5906
01:41:15,669 --> 01:41:15,679
whereas if you have like an ebi for
 

5907
01:41:15,679 --> 01:41:17,510
whereas if you have like an ebi for
example you have to finish the guy in

5908
01:41:17,510 --> 01:41:17,520
example you have to finish the guy in
 

5909
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:19,590
example you have to finish the guy in
regulation or you start in a jujitsu

5910
01:41:19,590 --> 01:41:19,600
regulation or you start in a jujitsu
 

5911
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:21,990
regulation or you start in a jujitsu
position with your back taken or

5912
01:41:21,990 --> 01:41:22,000
position with your back taken or
 

5913
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:23,350
position with your back taken or
in an arm bar

5914
01:41:23,350 --> 01:41:23,360
in an arm bar
 

5915
01:41:23,360 --> 01:41:25,750
in an arm bar
so i think that you have

5916
01:41:25,750 --> 01:41:25,760
so i think that you have
 

5917
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:28,550
so i think that you have
certain rule sets that play in the favor

5918
01:41:28,550 --> 01:41:28,560
certain rule sets that play in the favor
 

5919
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:32,470
certain rule sets that play in the favor
of certain athletes um and certain

5920
01:41:32,470 --> 01:41:32,480
of certain athletes um and certain
 

5921
01:41:32,480 --> 01:41:34,229
of certain athletes um and certain
athletes can win in one rule set but

5922
01:41:34,229 --> 01:41:34,239
athletes can win in one rule set but
 

5923
01:41:34,239 --> 01:41:35,990
athletes can win in one rule set but
then they just have no chance of winning

5924
01:41:35,990 --> 01:41:36,000
then they just have no chance of winning
 

5925
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:37,910
then they just have no chance of winning
in the other like when i fought yuri the

5926
01:41:37,910 --> 01:41:37,920
in the other like when i fought yuri the
 

5927
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:40,709
in the other like when i fought yuri the
first time in ebi i beat him in ebi the

5928
01:41:40,709 --> 01:41:40,719
first time in ebi i beat him in ebi the
 

5929
01:41:40,719 --> 01:41:42,550
first time in ebi i beat him in ebi the
chances of me beating him on that night

5930
01:41:42,550 --> 01:41:42,560
chances of me beating him on that night
 

5931
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:44,149
chances of me beating him on that night
under an adcc rule set were probably

5932
01:41:44,149 --> 01:41:44,159
under an adcc rule set were probably
 

5933
01:41:44,159 --> 01:41:46,790
under an adcc rule set were probably
pretty low um when i fought leandra lowe

5934
01:41:46,790 --> 01:41:46,800
pretty low um when i fought leandra lowe
 

5935
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:49,270
pretty low um when i fought leandra lowe
under an adcc rule set he beat me that

5936
01:41:49,270 --> 01:41:49,280
under an adcc rule set he beat me that
 

5937
01:41:49,280 --> 01:41:50,870
under an adcc rule set he beat me that
day but the chances of him beating me in

5938
01:41:50,870 --> 01:41:50,880
day but the chances of him beating me in
 

5939
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:52,470
day but the chances of him beating me in
the same day in an ebi rules that were

5940
01:41:52,470 --> 01:41:52,480
the same day in an ebi rules that were
 

5941
01:41:52,480 --> 01:41:54,709
the same day in an ebi rules that were
like next to zero

5942
01:41:54,709 --> 01:41:54,719
like next to zero
 

5943
01:41:54,719 --> 01:41:56,950
like next to zero
so i think it's interesting that

5944
01:41:56,950 --> 01:41:56,960
so i think it's interesting that
 

5945
01:41:56,960 --> 01:41:59,430
so i think it's interesting that
in mma you have one unified rule set

5946
01:41:59,430 --> 01:41:59,440
in mma you have one unified rule set
 

5947
01:41:59,440 --> 01:42:01,669
in mma you have one unified rule set
which have small differences but they're

5948
01:42:01,669 --> 01:42:01,679
which have small differences but they're
 

5949
01:42:01,679 --> 01:42:03,109
which have small differences but they're
all generally the same

5950
01:42:03,109 --> 01:42:03,119
all generally the same
 

5951

oh yeah the guy who strangled gordon but

6006

oh yeah the guy who strangled gordon but
 

6007
01:43:03,440 --> 01:43:05,030
oh yeah the guy who strangled gordon but
no one remembers that the first match

6008
01:43:05,030 --> 01:43:05,040
no one remembers that the first match
 

6009
01:43:05,040 --> 01:43:07,189
no one remembers that the first match
was like a 45 minute war

6010
01:43:07,189 --> 01:43:07,199
was like a 45 minute war
 

6011
01:43:07,199 --> 01:43:08,709
was like a 45 minute war
um and then the second match with the

6012
01:43:08,709 --> 01:43:08,719
um and then the second match with the
 

6013
01:43:08,719 --> 01:43:11,189
um and then the second match with the
full 20 minutes of adcc and if i didn't

6014
01:43:11,189 --> 01:43:11,199
full 20 minutes of adcc and if i didn't
 

6015
01:43:11,199 --> 01:43:13,590
full 20 minutes of adcc and if i didn't
get my back taken in like the last

6016
01:43:13,590 --> 01:43:13,600
get my back taken in like the last
 

6017
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:14,870
get my back taken in like the last
minute and a half two minutes it would

6018
01:43:14,870 --> 01:43:14,880
minute and a half two minutes it would
 

6019
01:43:14,880 --> 01:43:16,709
minute and a half two minutes it would
have went into an overtime that could

6020
01:43:16,709 --> 01:43:16,719
have went into an overtime that could
 

6021
01:43:16,719 --> 01:43:20,229
have went into an overtime that could
change the outcome of the match

6022
01:43:20,229 --> 01:43:20,239

 

6023
01:43:20,239 --> 01:43:22,470

i think that if you look at felipe's

6024
01:43:22,470 --> 01:43:22,480
i think that if you look at felipe's
 

6025
01:43:22,480 --> 01:43:24,870
i think that if you look at felipe's
performances especially nogi

6026
01:43:24,870 --> 01:43:24,880
performances especially nogi
 

6027
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:27,430
performances especially nogi
specifically nogi since then it looks

6028
01:43:27,430 --> 01:43:27,440
specifically nogi since then it looks
 

6029
01:43:27,440 --> 01:43:29,669
specifically nogi since then it looks
like he's almost gotten worse whereas

6030
01:43:29,669 --> 01:43:29,679
like he's almost gotten worse whereas
 

6031
01:43:29,679 --> 01:43:31,430
like he's almost gotten worse whereas
since that match

6032
01:43:31,430 --> 01:43:31,440
since that match
 

6033
01:43:31,440 --> 01:43:33,270
since that match
uh in 2017

6034
01:43:33,270 --> 01:43:33,280
uh in 2017
 

6035
01:43:33,280 --> 01:43:35,510
uh in 2017
uh the only match i lost after that was

6036
01:43:35,510 --> 01:43:35,520
uh the only match i lost after that was
 

6037
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:38,950
uh the only match i lost after that was
against vinny magalesh by my points and

6038
01:43:38,950 --> 01:43:38,960
against vinny magalesh by my points and
 

6039
01:43:38,960 --> 01:43:39,750
against vinny magalesh by my points and
uh

6040
01:43:39,750 --> 01:43:39,760
uh
 

6041
01:43:39,760 --> 01:43:41,590
uh
i'm on like a 55

6042
01:43:41,590 --> 01:43:41,600
i'm on like a 55
 

6043
01:43:41,600 --> 01:43:43,990
i'm on like a 55
match win streak um over the course of

6044
01:43:43,990 --> 01:43:44,000
match win streak um over the course of
 

6045
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:45,910

four years um winning all the major

four years um winning all the major
 

6047
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:48,870
four years um winning all the major
tournaments nogi and uh felipe since

6048
01:43:48,870 --> 01:43:48,880
tournaments nogi and uh felipe since
 

6049
01:43:48,880 --> 01:43:51,910
tournaments nogi and uh felipe since
that match i think is like five and two

6050
01:43:51,910 --> 01:43:51,920
that match i think is like five and two
 

6051
01:43:51,920 --> 01:43:53,270
that match i think is like five and two
uh nogi

6052
01:43:53,270 --> 01:43:53,280
uh nogi
 

6053
01:43:53,280 --> 01:43:55,510
uh nogi
and he's lost his last two match matches

6054
01:43:55,510 --> 01:43:55,520
and he's lost his last two match matches
 

6055
01:43:55,520 --> 01:43:57,350
and he's lost his last two match matches
one was convincingly where he was

6056
01:43:57,350 --> 01:43:57,360
one was convincingly where he was
 

6057
01:43:57,360 --> 01:43:58,870
one was convincingly where he was
dominated by andre and one was by

6058
01:43:58,870 --> 01:43:58,880
dominated by andre and one was by
 

6059
01:43:58,880 --> 01:44:01,270
dominated by andre and one was by
submission so i don't think that he's

6060
01:44:01,270 --> 01:44:01,280
submission so i don't think that he's
 

6061
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:03,830
submission so i don't think that he's
progressed nearly as fast if anything he

6062
01:44:03,830 --> 01:44:03,840
progressed nearly as fast if anything he
 

6063
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:05,750
progressed nearly as fast if anything he
looks like he's worse than he was when

6064
01:44:05,750 --> 01:44:05,760
looks like he's worse than he was when
 

6065
01:44:05,760 --> 01:44:07,750
looks like he's worse than he was when
he beat me in 2017 based on his previous

6066
01:44:07,750 --> 01:44:07,760
he beat me in 2017 based on his previous
 

6067
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:09,109
he beat me in 2017 based on his previous
performances

6068
01:44:09,109 --> 01:44:09,119
performances
 

6069
01:44:09,119 --> 01:44:10,149
performances
that being said i know he's going to

6070
01:44:10,149 --> 01:44:10,159
that being said i know he's going to
 

6071
01:44:10,159 --> 01:44:11,030
that being said i know he's going to
come in

6072
01:44:11,030 --> 01:44:11,040
come in
 

6073
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:12,950
come in
training very hard for this one and he's

6074
01:44:12,950 --> 01:44:12,960
training very hard for this one and he's
 

6075
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:14,629
training very hard for this one and he's
going to be prepared but i just don't

6076
01:44:14,629 --> 01:44:14,639
going to be prepared but i just don't
 

6077
01:44:14,639 --> 01:44:15,990
going to be prepared but i just don't
think

6078
01:44:15,990 --> 01:44:16,000
think
 

6079
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:16,870
think
that

6080
01:44:16,870 --> 01:44:16,880
that
 

6081
01:44:16,880 --> 01:44:18,950
that
in terms of technical ability he's

6082
01:44:18,950 --> 01:44:18,960
in terms of technical ability he's
 

6083
01:44:18,960 --> 01:44:21,590
in terms of technical ability he's
anywhere near my level and

6084
01:44:21,590 --> 01:44:21,600
anywhere near my level and
 

6085
01:44:21,600 --> 01:44:23,189
anywhere near my level and
he was much bigger than me

6086
01:44:23,189 --> 01:44:23,199
he was much bigger than me
 

6087
01:44:23,199 --> 01:44:25,750
he was much bigger than me
both times we fought um the first time

6088
01:44:25,750 --> 01:44:25,760
both times we fought um the first time
 

6089
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:26,950
both times we fought um the first time
he was much bigger than me the second

6090
01:44:26,950 --> 01:44:26,960
he was much bigger than me the second
 

6091
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:29,030
he was much bigger than me the second
time he was one-way class above me

6092
01:44:29,030 --> 01:44:29,040
time he was one-way class above me
 

6093
01:44:29,040 --> 01:44:30,149
time he was one-way class above me
so now there's not going to be an

6094
01:44:30,149 --> 01:44:30,159
so now there's not going to be an
 

6095
01:44:30,159 --> 01:44:31,990
so now there's not going to be an
advantage in

6096
01:44:31,990 --> 01:44:32,000
advantage in
 

6097
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:33,350
advantage in
technicality and it's also not going to

6098
01:44:33,350 --> 01:44:33,360
technicality and it's also not going to
 

6099
01:44:33,360 --> 01:44:35,270
technicality and it's also not going to
be a physicality advantage so i think

6100
01:44:35,270 --> 01:44:35,280
be a physicality advantage so i think
 

6101
01:44:35,280 --> 01:44:40,149
be a physicality advantage so i think
he's just going to be beat everywhere

6102
01:44:40,149 --> 01:44:40,159

 

6103
01:44:40,159 --> 01:44:41,750

this is uh this is a good example of the

6104
01:44:41,750 --> 01:44:41,760
this is uh this is a good example of the
 

6105
01:44:41,760 --> 01:44:44,629
this is uh this is a good example of the
scientific response to a um

6106
01:44:44,629 --> 01:44:44,639
scientific response to a um
 

6107
01:44:44,639 --> 01:44:47,669
scientific response to a um
to a comment to a question yeah so he's

6108
01:44:47,669 --> 01:44:47,679
to a comment to a question yeah so he's
 

6109
01:44:47,679 --> 01:44:51,350
to a comment to a question yeah so he's
not um

6110
01:44:51,350 --> 01:44:51,360

 

6111
01:44:51,360 --> 01:44:53,350

that that's a match you're you're not

6112
01:44:53,350 --> 01:44:53,360
that that's a match you're you're not
 

6113
01:44:53,360 --> 01:44:55,109
that that's a match you're you're not
deeply concerned with

6114
01:44:55,109 --> 01:44:55,119
deeply concerned with
 

6115
01:44:55,119 --> 01:44:57,910
deeply concerned with
in terms of the set of opponents because

6116
01:44:57,910 --> 01:44:57,920
in terms of the set of opponents because
 

6117
01:44:57,920 --> 01:44:59,830
in terms of the set of opponents because
you have and you will be facing a lot of

6118
01:44:59,830 --> 01:44:59,840
you have and you will be facing a lot of
 

6119
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:01,669
you have and you will be facing a lot of
really difficult

6120
01:45:01,669 --> 01:45:01,679
really difficult
 

6121
01:45:01,679 --> 01:45:02,870
really difficult
that's actually in my opinion one of the

6122
01:45:02,870 --> 01:45:02,880
that's actually in my opinion one of the
 

6123
01:45:02,880 --> 01:45:04,550
that's actually in my opinion one of the
easier matches because of the fact that

6124
01:45:04,550 --> 01:45:04,560
easier matches because of the fact that
 

6125
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:06,470
easier matches because of the fact that
we're relatively the same size

6126
01:45:06,470 --> 01:45:06,480
we're relatively the same size
 

6127
01:45:06,480 --> 01:45:09,510
we're relatively the same size
um if i show up at 230 pounds like a lot

6128
01:45:09,510 --> 01:45:09,520
um if i show up at 230 pounds like a lot
 

6129
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:10,790
um if i show up at 230 pounds like a lot
of the guys are

6130
01:45:10,790 --> 01:45:10,800
of the guys are
 

6131
01:45:10,800 --> 01:45:13,830
of the guys are
260 270 plus so that extra weight does

6132
01:45:13,830 --> 01:45:13,840
260 270 plus so that extra weight does
 

6133
01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:15,430
260 270 plus so that extra weight does
make a difference i think out of that

6134
01:45:15,430 --> 01:45:15,440
make a difference i think out of that
 

6135
01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:17,430
make a difference i think out of that
entire bracket

6136
01:45:17,430 --> 01:45:17,440
entire bracket
 

6137
01:45:17,440 --> 01:45:18,550
entire bracket
felipe is probably going to be the one

6138
01:45:18,550 --> 01:45:18,560
felipe is probably going to be the one
 

6139
01:45:18,560 --> 01:45:19,910
felipe is probably going to be the one
of the easiest matches because of the

6140
01:45:19,910 --> 01:45:19,920
of the easiest matches because of the
 

6141
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:22,149
of the easiest matches because of the
fact that i can easily take him down and

6142
01:45:22,149 --> 01:45:22,159
fact that i can easily take him down and
 

6143
01:45:22,159 --> 01:45:23,510
fact that i can easily take him down and
if i take him out i'm going to pass his

6144
01:45:23,510 --> 01:45:23,520
if i take him out i'm going to pass his
 

6145
01:45:23,520 --> 01:45:25,830
if i take him out i'm going to pass his
guard whereas i feel like the other guys

6146
01:45:25,830 --> 01:45:25,840
guard whereas i feel like the other guys
 

6147
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:27,270
guard whereas i feel like the other guys
because they're so much bigger and

6148
01:45:27,270 --> 01:45:27,280
because they're so much bigger and
 

6149
01:45:27,280 --> 01:45:29,109
because they're so much bigger and
they're very cagey

6150
01:45:29,109 --> 01:45:29,119
they're very cagey
 

6151
01:45:29,119 --> 01:45:31,189
they're very cagey
it may take me a while to actually

6152
01:45:31,189 --> 01:45:31,199
it may take me a while to actually
 

6153
01:45:31,199 --> 01:45:33,430
it may take me a while to actually
take them to the ground

6154
01:45:33,430 --> 01:45:33,440
take them to the ground
 

6155
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:34,870
take them to the ground
and get on top of them and i think it

6156
01:45:34,870 --> 01:45:34,880
and get on top of them and i think it
 

6157
01:45:34,880 --> 01:45:36,550
and get on top of them and i think it
may be they may be longer drawn out

6158
01:45:36,550 --> 01:45:36,560
may be they may be longer drawn out
 

6159
01:45:36,560 --> 01:45:37,910
may be they may be longer drawn out
matches because of the fact that they're

6160
01:45:37,910 --> 01:45:37,920
matches because of the fact that they're
 

6161
01:45:37,920 --> 01:45:39,910
matches because of the fact that they're
so much bigger and stally it's hard to

6162
01:45:39,910 --> 01:45:39,920
so much bigger and stally it's hard to
 

6163
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:41,830
so much bigger and stally it's hard to
take them down but felipe is relatively

6164
01:45:41,830 --> 01:45:41,840
take them down but felipe is relatively
 

6165
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:44,950
take them down but felipe is relatively
my size and as wrestling is atrocious so

6166
01:45:44,950 --> 01:45:44,960
my size and as wrestling is atrocious so
 

6167
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:46,229
my size and as wrestling is atrocious so
and i've already taken them down in the

6168
01:45:46,229 --> 01:45:46,239
and i've already taken them down in the
 

6169
01:45:46,239 --> 01:45:48,470
and i've already taken them down in the
last adcc match so i'm pretty sure i can

6170
01:45:48,470 --> 01:45:48,480
last adcc match so i'm pretty sure i can
 

6171
01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:49,990
last adcc match so i'm pretty sure i can
just easily put them down pass them and

6172
01:45:49,990 --> 01:45:50,000
just easily put them down pass them and
 

6173
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:51,750
just easily put them down pass them and
then finish them

6174
01:45:51,750 --> 01:45:51,760
then finish them
 

6175

people down for extended periods of time
 

6911
01:58:46,800 --> 01:58:48,950
people down for extended periods of time
both of them were

6912
01:58:48,950 --> 01:58:48,960
both of them were
 

6913
01:58:48,960 --> 01:58:51,589
both of them were
powerful strikers on the ground and

6914
01:58:51,589 --> 01:58:51,599
powerful strikers on the ground and
 

6915
01:58:51,599 --> 01:58:54,070
powerful strikers on the ground and
could do terrible damage to opponents

6916
01:58:54,070 --> 01:58:54,080
could do terrible damage to opponents
 

6917
01:58:54,080 --> 01:58:55,669
could do terrible damage to opponents
on the floor so

6918
01:58:55,669 --> 01:58:55,679
on the floor so
 

6919
01:58:55,679 --> 01:58:58,790
on the floor so
they're both very similar in that regard

6920
01:58:58,790 --> 01:58:58,800
they're both very similar in that regard
 

6921
01:58:58,800 --> 01:59:00,629
they're both very similar in that regard
khabib was mostly a

6922
01:59:00,629 --> 01:59:00,639
khabib was mostly a
 

6923
01:59:00,639 --> 01:59:02,709
khabib was mostly a
puncher from the back george is mostly

6924
01:59:02,709 --> 01:59:02,719
puncher from the back george is mostly
 

6925
01:59:02,719 --> 01:59:04,870
puncher from the back george is mostly
an elbow from the front

6926
01:59:04,870 --> 01:59:04,880
an elbow from the front
 

6927
01:59:04,880 --> 01:59:06,870
an elbow from the front
but both of them could lay waste to

6928
01:59:06,870 --> 01:59:06,880
but both of them could lay waste to
 

6929
01:59:06,880 --> 01:59:07,910
but both of them could lay waste to
opponents

6930
01:59:07,910 --> 01:59:07,920
opponents
 

6931
01:59:07,920 --> 01:59:09,750
opponents
with strikes on the floor

6932
01:59:09,750 --> 01:59:09,760
with strikes on the floor
 

6933
01:59:09,760 --> 01:59:12,950
with strikes on the floor
um both of them were highly competent

6934
01:59:12,950 --> 01:59:12,960
um both of them were highly competent
 

6935
01:59:12,960 --> 01:59:14,629
um both of them were highly competent
with submissions on the ground there

6936
01:59:14,629 --> 01:59:14,639
with submissions on the ground there
 

6937
01:59:14,639 --> 01:59:16,070
with submissions on the ground there
weren't submission specialists in the

6938
01:59:16,070 --> 01:59:16,080
weren't submission specialists in the
 

6939
01:59:16,080 --> 01:59:18,629
weren't submission specialists in the
sense of someone like gordon ryan but

6940
01:59:18,629 --> 01:59:18,639
sense of someone like gordon ryan but
 

6941
01:59:18,639 --> 01:59:19,990
sense of someone like gordon ryan but
they were

6942
01:59:19,990 --> 01:59:20,000
they were
 

6943
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,149
they were
certainly um

6944
01:59:22,149 --> 01:59:22,159
certainly um
 

6945
01:59:22,159 --> 01:59:24,629
certainly um
no slouches with submission holds

6946
01:59:24,629 --> 01:59:24,639
no slouches with submission holds
 

6947
01:59:24,639 --> 01:59:26,149
no slouches with submission holds
um

6948
01:59:26,149 --> 01:59:26,159
um
 

6949
01:59:26,159 --> 01:59:28,629
um
yeah it's just a fascinating idea so

6950
01:59:28,629 --> 01:59:28,639
yeah it's just a fascinating idea so
 

6951
01:59:28,639 --> 01:59:30,470
yeah it's just a fascinating idea so
it's almost like who gets the first take

6952
01:59:30,470 --> 01:59:30,480
it's almost like who gets the first take
 

6953
01:59:30,480 --> 01:59:33,189
it's almost like who gets the first take
down yeah i do believe

6954
01:59:33,189 --> 01:59:33,199
down yeah i do believe
 

6955
01:59:33,199 --> 01:59:34,310
down yeah i do believe
that

6956
01:59:34,310 --> 01:59:34,320
that
 

6957
01:59:34,320 --> 01:59:36,070
that
they could probably stand up on each

6958
01:59:36,070 --> 01:59:36,080
they could probably stand up on each
 

6959
01:59:36,080 --> 01:59:37,109
they could probably stand up on each
other

6960
01:59:37,109 --> 01:59:37,119
other
 

6961
01:59:37,119 --> 01:59:38,629
other
i don't think either one of them would

6962
01:59:38,629 --> 01:59:38,639
i don't think either one of them would
 

6963
01:59:38,639 --> 01:59:40,229
i don't think either one of them would
be able to hold the other down for a

6964
01:59:40,229 --> 01:59:40,239
be able to hold the other down for a
 

6965
01:59:40,239 --> 01:59:41,589
be able to hold the other down for a
whole round

6966
01:59:41,589 --> 01:59:41,599
whole round
 

6967
01:59:41,599 --> 01:59:43,669
whole round
um both of them are notoriously

6968
01:59:43,669 --> 01:59:43,679
um both of them are notoriously
 

6969
01:59:43,679 --> 01:59:46,629
um both of them are notoriously
difficult people to hold down so i don't

6970
01:59:46,629 --> 01:59:46,639
difficult people to hold down so i don't
 

6971
01:59:46,639 --> 01:59:48,149
difficult people to hold down so i don't
think that whoever won the first date

6972
01:59:48,149 --> 01:59:48,159
think that whoever won the first date
 

6973
01:59:48,159 --> 01:59:49,510
think that whoever won the first date
and wins the match i don't think it's

6974
01:59:49,510 --> 01:59:49,520
and wins the match i don't think it's
 

6975
01:59:49,520 --> 01:59:50,470
and wins the match i don't think it's
like that

6976
01:59:50,470 --> 01:59:50,480
like that
 

6977
01:59:50,480 --> 01:59:53,430
like that
um i do believe that george would hold a

6978
01:59:53,430 --> 01:59:53,440
um i do believe that george would hold a
 

6979
01:59:53,440 --> 01:59:55,910
um i do believe that george would hold a
decisive advantage in striking and

6980
01:59:55,910 --> 01:59:55,920
decisive advantage in striking and
 

6981
01:59:55,920 --> 01:59:59,109
decisive advantage in striking and
distance management um the few times

6982
01:59:59,109 --> 01:59:59,119
distance management um the few times
 

6983
01:59:59,119 --> 02:00:01,830
distance management um the few times
that khabib did look shaky is

6984
02:00:01,830 --> 02:00:01,840
that khabib did look shaky is
 

6985
02:00:01,840 --> 02:00:03,270
that khabib did look shaky is
when he

6986
02:00:03,270 --> 02:00:03,280
when he
 

6987
02:00:03,280 --> 02:00:05,510
when he
could be was either advancing forward

6988
02:00:05,510 --> 02:00:05,520
could be was either advancing forward
 

6989
02:00:05,520 --> 02:00:07,589
could be was either advancing forward
menacingly but when he had to

6990
02:00:07,589 --> 02:00:07,599
menacingly but when he had to
 

6991
02:00:07,599 --> 02:00:09,750
menacingly but when he had to
to fight moving backwards

6992
02:00:09,750 --> 02:00:09,760
to fight moving backwards
 

6993
02:00:09,760 --> 02:00:11,589
to fight moving backwards
there was a definite asymmetry between

6994
02:00:11,589 --> 02:00:11,599
there was a definite asymmetry between
 

6995
02:00:11,599 --> 02:00:13,189
there was a definite asymmetry between
his ability to fight going forwards

6996
02:00:13,189 --> 02:00:13,199
his ability to fight going forwards
 

6997
02:00:13,199 --> 02:00:15,109
his ability to fight going forwards
which is very good and his ability to

6998
02:00:15,109 --> 02:00:15,119
which is very good and his ability to
 

6999
02:00:15,119 --> 02:00:16,390
which is very good and his ability to
fight going backwards which was

7000
02:00:16,390 --> 02:00:16,400
fight going backwards which was
 

7001
02:00:16,400 --> 02:00:17,589
fight going backwards which was
noticeably

7002
02:00:17,589 --> 02:00:17,599
noticeably
 

7003
02:00:17,599 --> 02:00:18,709
noticeably
weaker

7004
02:00:18,709 --> 02:00:18,719
weaker
 

7005
02:00:18,719 --> 02:00:21,669
weaker
um george would often fight both

7006
02:00:21,669 --> 02:00:21,679
um george would often fight both
 

7007
02:00:21,679 --> 02:00:23,750
um george would often fight both
forwards and backwards and with thiago

7008
02:00:23,750 --> 02:00:23,760
forwards and backwards and with thiago
 

7009
02:00:23,760 --> 02:00:25,270
forwards and backwards and with thiago
elvis fight

7010
02:00:25,270 --> 02:00:25,280
elvis fight
 

7011
02:00:25,280 --> 02:00:27,910
elvis fight
most of the standing time yeah was was

7012
02:00:27,910 --> 02:00:27,920
most of the standing time yeah was was
 

7013
02:00:27,920 --> 02:00:29,270
most of the standing time yeah was was
going backwards

7014
02:00:29,270 --> 02:00:29,280
going backwards
 

7015
02:00:29,280 --> 02:00:30,950
going backwards
um

7016
02:00:30,950 --> 02:00:30,960
um
 

7017
02:00:30,960 --> 02:00:31,830
um
that's

7018
02:00:31,830 --> 02:00:31,840
that's
 

7019
02:00:31,840 --> 02:00:33,430
that's
probably the the single biggest

7020
02:00:33,430 --> 02:00:33,440
probably the the single biggest
 

7021
02:00:33,440 --> 02:00:35,109
probably the the single biggest
difference between that two athletes and

7022
02:00:35,109 --> 02:00:35,119
difference between that two athletes and
 

7023
02:00:35,119 --> 02:00:36,870
difference between that two athletes and
skill level would be in the standing

7024
02:00:36,870 --> 02:00:36,880
skill level would be in the standing
 

7025
02:00:36,880 --> 02:00:37,910
skill level would be in the standing
position

7026
02:00:37,910 --> 02:00:37,920
position
 

7027
02:00:37,920 --> 02:00:38,790
position
um

7028
02:00:38,790 --> 02:00:38,800
um
 

7029
02:00:38,800 --> 02:00:41,669
um
on the ground uh

7030
02:00:41,669 --> 02:00:41,679
on the ground uh
 

7031
02:00:41,679 --> 02:00:43,990
on the ground uh
khabib slight edge and takedowns on the

7032
02:00:43,990 --> 02:00:44,000
khabib slight edge and takedowns on the
 

7033
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,310
khabib slight edge and takedowns on the
fence george slight edge and takedowns

7034
02:00:46,310 --> 02:00:46,320
fence george slight edge and takedowns
 

7035
02:00:46,320 --> 02:00:47,589
fence george slight edge and takedowns
in the center

7036
02:00:47,589 --> 02:00:47,599
in the center
 

7037
02:00:47,599 --> 02:00:50,310
in the center
um ability to inflict damage on the

7038
02:00:50,310 --> 02:00:50,320
um ability to inflict damage on the
 

7039
02:00:50,320 --> 02:00:52,629
um ability to inflict damage on the
floor roughly equal ability to fight off

7040
02:00:52,629 --> 02:00:52,639
floor roughly equal ability to fight off
 

7041
02:00:52,639 --> 02:00:54,870
floor roughly equal ability to fight off
the back roughly equal

7042
02:00:54,870 --> 02:00:54,880
the back roughly equal
 

7043
02:00:54,880 --> 02:00:56,790
the back roughly equal
ability to stand up from bottom roughly

7044
02:00:56,790 --> 02:00:56,800
ability to stand up from bottom roughly
 

7045
02:00:56,800 --> 02:01:00,310
ability to stand up from bottom roughly
equal it's a very very hard match

7046
02:01:00,310 --> 02:01:00,320
equal it's a very very hard match
 

7047
02:01:00,320 --> 02:01:02,550
equal it's a very very hard match
in terms of the biggest

7048
02:01:02,550 --> 02:01:02,560
in terms of the biggest
 

7049
02:01:02,560 --> 02:01:03,990
in terms of the biggest
difference in skill level is going to be

7050
02:01:03,990 --> 02:01:04,000
difference in skill level is going to be
 

7051
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:05,990
difference in skill level is going to be
in a standing position and so it would

7052
02:01:05,990 --> 02:01:06,000
in a standing position and so it would
 

7053
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:07,270
in a standing position and so it would
come down to

7054
02:01:07,270 --> 02:01:07,280
come down to
 

7055
02:01:07,280 --> 02:01:09,350
come down to
um that doesn't necessarily mean that

7056
02:01:09,350 --> 02:01:09,360
um that doesn't necessarily mean that
 

7057
02:01:09,360 --> 02:01:10,629
um that doesn't necessarily mean that
khabib would lose in the standing

7058
02:01:10,629 --> 02:01:10,639
khabib would lose in the standing
 

7059
02:01:10,639 --> 02:01:11,910
khabib would lose in the standing
position he might just push it to the

7060
02:01:11,910 --> 02:01:11,920
position he might just push it to the
 

7061
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:14,709
position he might just push it to the
fence and just use match tactics where

7062
02:01:14,709 --> 02:01:14,719
fence and just use match tactics where
 

7063
02:01:14,719 --> 02:01:15,910
fence and just use match tactics where
he

7064
02:01:15,910 --> 02:01:15,920
he
 

7065
02:01:15,920 --> 02:01:17,830
he
kept the fight on the fence for

7066
02:01:17,830 --> 02:01:17,840
kept the fight on the fence for
 

7067
02:01:17,840 --> 02:01:20,950
kept the fight on the fence for
significant periods of time

7068
02:01:20,950 --> 02:01:20,960
significant periods of time
 

7069
02:01:20,960 --> 02:01:22,870
significant periods of time
and you can win rounds in that fashion

7070
02:01:22,870 --> 02:01:22,880
and you can win rounds in that fashion
 

7071
02:01:22,880 --> 02:01:25,189
and you can win rounds in that fashion
so it's a match that could go either way

7072
02:01:25,189 --> 02:01:25,199
so it's a match that could go either way
 

7073
02:01:25,199 --> 02:01:27,510
so it's a match that could go either way
both of them are uh absolutely the best

7074
02:01:27,510 --> 02:01:27,520

match against grayson thibault could
have gone either way uh george's match

7126

have gone either way uh george's match
 

7127
02:02:23,920 --> 02:02:26,310
have gone either way uh george's match
with hendrix was could have gone either

02:02:26,310 --> 02:02:26,320
with hendrix was could have gone either
 

7129
02:02:26,320 --> 02:02:28,870
with hendrix was could have gone either
way they all had matches that they won

7130

way they all had matches that they won
 

7131

way they all had matches that they won
which people would dispute the outcome

7132
02:02:30,950 --> 02:02:30,960
which people would dispute the outcome
 

7133
02:02:30,960 --> 02:02:32,470
which people would dispute the outcome
so that was a similarity between the

7134
02:02:32,470 --> 02:02:32,480
so that was a similarity between the
 

7135
02:02:32,480 --> 02:02:33,750
so that was a similarity between the
three of them

7136

three of them
 

7137

um
 

7139
02:02:34,719 --> 02:02:37,830
um
all three of them

7140

to dominate the direction of fights when
 

7145
02:02:41,840 --> 02:02:43,910
to dominate the direction of fights when
they want it to go down it goes down

02:02:43,910 --> 02:02:43,920
they want it to go down it goes down
 

7147
02:02:43,920 --> 02:02:45,430
they want it to go down it goes down
when they don't want it to go down it

7148
02:02:45,430 --> 02:02:45,440
when they don't want it to go down it
 

7149
02:02:45,440 --> 02:02:46,470
when they don't want it to go down it

um
 

7153
02:02:47,599 --> 02:02:49,270
um
that's why i put such a heavy emphasis

7154
02:02:49,270 --> 02:02:49,280
that's why i put such a heavy emphasis
 

7155
02:02:49,280 --> 02:02:51,510
that's why i put such a heavy emphasis
on that idea that a mixed martial arts

most important attribute that they all
must have

7164

um
 

7167
02:02:59,520 --> 02:03:01,350
um
as to which of the three

7168
02:03:01,350 --> 02:03:01,360
as to which of the three
 

7169
02:03:01,360 --> 02:03:02,870
as to which of the three
is the best it's going to come down to

7170
02:03:02,870 --> 02:03:02,880
is the best it's going to come down to
 

7171
02:03:02,880 --> 02:03:04,790
is the best it's going to come down to
criteria

7172
02:03:04,790 --> 02:03:04,800
criteria
 

7173
02:03:04,800 --> 02:03:07,830
criteria
you you can't pull them apart

7174
02:03:07,830 --> 02:03:07,840
you you can't pull them apart
 

7175
02:03:07,840 --> 02:03:09,669
you you can't pull them apart
which answer you give as to which of

those three is the greatest of all time
 

7179
02:03:11,119 --> 02:03:12,790
those three is the greatest of all time
will come down to the criteria that you

7180
02:03:12,790 --> 02:03:12,800
will come down to the criteria that you
 

7181
02:03:12,800 --> 02:03:13,750
will come down to the criteria that you
use

7182
02:03:13,750 --> 02:03:13,760
use

um
 

7187
02:03:17,360 --> 02:03:19,350
um
is it the amount of time was it the

7188
02:03:19,350 --> 02:03:19,360
is it the amount of time was it the
 

7189
02:03:19,360 --> 02:03:21,030
is it the amount of time was it the
quality of the opponents that they had

7190
02:03:21,030 --> 02:03:21,040
quality of the opponents that they had
 

7191
02:03:21,040 --> 02:03:22,709
quality of the opponents that they had
if you do it by quality of opponents i

7192
02:03:22,709 --> 02:03:22,719
if you do it by quality of opponents i
 

7193
02:03:22,719 --> 02:03:24,310
if you do it by quality of opponents i
think you probably have to give it to

7194
02:03:24,310 --> 02:03:24,320
think you probably have to give it to
 

7195
02:03:24,320 --> 02:03:26,390
think you probably have to give it to
george if you do it by

dominance as as we saw previously so

you've got those three guys in my

7220
02:03:50,709 --> 02:03:50,719
you've got those three guys in my
 

7221
02:03:50,719 --> 02:03:53,189
you've got those three guys in my
opinion and which one you choose will

7222
02:03:53,189 --> 02:03:53,199
opinion and which one you choose will
 

7223
02:03:53,199 --> 02:03:55,510
opinion and which one you choose will
come down to who it says more about who

come down to who it says more about who
 

7225
02:03:55,520 --> 02:03:57,910
come down to who it says more about who
you are as a viewer than it does about

7226
02:03:57,910 --> 02:03:57,920
you are as a viewer than it does about
 

7227
02:03:57,920 --> 02:04:00,149
you are as a viewer than it does about
the respective level of the athletes you

7228
02:04:00,149 --> 02:04:00,159
the respective level of the athletes you
 

7229
02:04:00,159 --> 02:04:01,510
the respective level of the athletes you
could throw a blanket over them the

7230
02:04:01,510 --> 02:04:01,520
could throw a blanket over them the
 

7231
02:04:01,520 --> 02:04:04,870
could throw a blanket over them the
three of them are just that good and um

7232
02:04:04,870 --> 02:04:04,880
three of them are just that good and um
 

7233
02:04:04,880 --> 02:04:07,270
three of them are just that good and um
uh and which one you select will

uh and which one you select will
 

7235
02:04:07,280 --> 02:04:09,109
uh and which one you select will
probably say more about who you are as a

there's none of that um and then it's
 

7597
02:10:29,360 --> 02:10:31,189
there's none of that um and then it's
just an inherent

7598
02:10:31,189 --> 02:10:31,199
just an inherent
 

7599
02:10:31,199 --> 02:10:33,669

stop you start from top mount and you're
facing the guy and then you put them

7606
02:10:38,229 --> 02:10:38,239
facing the guy and then you put them
 

7607
02:10:38,239 --> 02:10:40,149
facing the guy and then you put them
down and you're not directly behind them

7608
02:10:40,149 --> 02:10:40,159
down and you're not directly behind them
 

7609

with leg locks you're facing the guy
 

7611
02:10:42,159 --> 02:10:43,750
with leg locks you're facing the guy
whereas when you're on someone's back

02:10:43,750 --> 02:10:43,760
whereas when you're on someone's back
 

7613
02:10:43,760 --> 02:10:45,589
whereas when you're on someone's back
you have them in a pin where you can

02:10:52,470 --> 02:10:52,480
grease his way out most of the time
 

7623
02:10:52,480 --> 02:10:53,910
grease his way out most of the time
and there's an inherent advantage you

7624
02:10:53,910 --> 02:10:53,920
and there's an inherent advantage you
 

7625
02:10:53,920 --> 02:10:55,669

shorter thicker statue
 

7727
02:12:36,320 --> 02:12:37,109
shorter thicker statue
to

7728
02:12:37,109 --> 02:12:37,119
to
 

7729
02:12:37,119 --> 02:12:39,030
to
employ on on on big people if your

7730
02:12:39,030 --> 02:12:39,040
employ on on on big people if your
 

7731
02:12:39,040 --> 02:12:40,950
employ on on on big people if your
opponent is very broadly built through

7732
02:12:40,950 --> 02:12:40,960
opponent is very broadly built through
 

7733
02:12:40,960 --> 02:12:42,629
opponent is very broadly built through
the stomach it's almost impossible to

7734
02:12:42,629 --> 02:12:42,639
the stomach it's almost impossible to
 

7735
02:12:42,639 --> 02:12:43,830
the stomach it's almost impossible to
apply

7736
02:12:43,830 --> 02:12:43,840
apply
 

7737
02:12:43,840 --> 02:12:46,069
apply
and so because it can't be applied by

7738
02:12:46,069 --> 02:12:46,079
and so because it can't be applied by
 

7739
02:12:46,079 --> 02:12:47,990
and so because it can't be applied by
all people it tends not to be taught

7740
02:12:47,990 --> 02:12:48,000
all people it tends not to be taught
 

7741
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:49,990
all people it tends not to be taught
much at beginner level

7742
02:12:49,990 --> 02:12:50,000
much at beginner level
 

7743
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:51,109
much at beginner level
and

7744
02:12:51,109 --> 02:12:51,119
and
 

7745
02:12:51,119 --> 02:12:54,950
and
so as a result it was always seen as a

7746
02:12:54,950 --> 02:12:54,960
so as a result it was always seen as a
 

7747
02:12:54,960 --> 02:12:57,430
so as a result it was always seen as a
kind of a specialist move for taller

7748
02:12:57,430 --> 02:12:57,440
kind of a specialist move for taller
 

7749
02:12:57,440 --> 02:12:59,109
kind of a specialist move for taller
athletes at a higher level of

7750
02:12:59,109 --> 02:12:59,119
athletes at a higher level of
 

7751
02:12:59,119 --> 02:13:00,790
athletes at a higher level of
competition rather than a broad-based

7752
02:13:00,790 --> 02:13:00,800
competition rather than a broad-based
 

7753
02:13:00,800 --> 02:13:03,350
competition rather than a broad-based
move for everyone or every body type in

7754
02:13:03,350 --> 02:13:03,360
move for everyone or every body type in
 

7755
02:13:03,360 --> 02:13:05,589
move for everyone or every body type in
every class to employ so it just didn't

7756
02:13:05,589 --> 02:13:05,599
every class to employ so it just didn't
 

7757
02:13:05,599 --> 02:13:07,430
every class to employ so it just didn't
get emphasized that much but in top

7758
02:13:07,430 --> 02:13:07,440
get emphasized that much but in top
 

7759
02:13:07,440 --> 02:13:10,149
get emphasized that much but in top
level competition now i think you would

7760
02:13:10,149 --> 02:13:10,159
level competition now i think you would
 

7761
02:13:10,159 --> 02:13:12,149
level competition now i think you would
see that it's very apparent that the

7762
02:13:12,149 --> 02:13:12,159
see that it's very apparent that the
 

7763
02:13:12,159 --> 02:13:13,910
see that it's very apparent that the
vast majority of athletes whenever they

7764
02:13:13,910 --> 02:13:13,920
vast majority of athletes whenever they
 

7765
02:13:13,920 --> 02:13:16,229
vast majority of athletes whenever they
have the opportunity or a choice between

body triangle and regular rear mounts
 

7769
02:13:19,440 --> 02:13:20,950
body triangle and regular rear mounts
the majority of modern athletes would

7770
02:13:20,950 --> 02:13:20,960
the majority of modern athletes would
 

7771
02:13:20,960 --> 02:13:22,629
the majority of modern athletes would
choose a body triangle

7772
02:13:22,629 --> 02:13:22,639
choose a body triangle
 

7773
02:13:22,639 --> 02:13:24,149
choose a body triangle

highest percentage
 

7781
02:13:29,840 --> 02:13:31,589
highest percentage
not statistically speaking perhaps

7782
02:13:31,589 --> 02:13:31,599
not statistically speaking perhaps
 

7783
02:13:31,599 --> 02:13:32,950

know
it is interesting something being a high

7844
02:14:36,149 --> 02:14:36,159
it is interesting something being a high
 

7845
02:14:36,159 --> 02:14:37,910
it is interesting something being a high
percentage in terms of effectiveness

7846
02:14:37,910 --> 02:14:37,920
percentage in terms of effectiveness
 

7847
02:14:37,920 --> 02:14:39,910
percentage in terms of effectiveness
tells a story you're saying that every

athlete is different but
 

7851
02:14:41,679 --> 02:14:44,790
athlete is different but
if it's more effective for most people

7852
02:14:44,790 --> 02:14:44,800
if it's more effective for most people
 

7853
02:14:44,800 --> 02:14:46,310
if it's more effective for most people
i mean it's interesting it's it's

that
 

7859
02:14:49,199 --> 02:14:51,270
that
the highest percentage thing

7860
02:14:51,270 --> 02:14:51,280
the highest percentage thing
 

7861
02:14:51,280 --> 02:14:53,350
the highest percentage thing
is actually

7862
02:14:53,350 --> 02:14:53,360
is actually
 

7863
02:14:53,360 --> 02:14:54,709
is actually
in collegial wrestling that he was

7864
02:14:54,709 --> 02:14:54,719
in collegial wrestling that he was
 

7865
02:14:54,719 --> 02:14:56,229
in collegial wrestling that he was
talking about is

7866

talking about is
 

7867
02:14:56,239 --> 02:14:58,709
talking about is
on the defensive side so blocking your

7868
02:14:58,709 --> 02:14:58,719
on the defensive side so blocking your
 

7869
02:14:58,719 --> 02:15:00,790
on the defensive side so blocking your
takedown and spinning around to the to

the back
so that's an interesting idea then also

7874
02:15:05,189 --> 02:15:05,199
so that's an interesting idea then also
 

7875
02:15:05,199 --> 02:15:07,030
so that's an interesting idea then also
there's all of these kind of going in

7882
02:15:12,229 --> 02:15:12,239
wizard position and doing knee tap like
 

7883
02:15:12,239 --> 02:15:13,910
wizard position and doing knee tap like
there's all these kinds of combinations

7884
02:15:13,910 --> 02:15:13,920
there's all these kinds of combinations
 

7885
02:15:13,920 --> 02:15:16,229
there's all these kinds of combinations
that seem to be effective when you look

7886
02:15:16,229 --> 02:15:16,239
that seem to be effective when you look
 

7887
02:15:16,239 --> 02:15:18,149
that seem to be effective when you look
at the statistics and it seems like

7888
02:15:18,149 --> 02:15:18,159
at the statistics and it seems like
 

7889
02:15:18,159 --> 02:15:19,910
at the statistics and it seems like
there's maybe it's a scientific way of

7890
02:15:19,910 --> 02:15:19,920
there's maybe it's a scientific way of
 

7891
02:15:19,920 --> 02:15:22,390
there's maybe it's a scientific way of
thinking but it seems like there is some

7892
02:15:22,390 --> 02:15:22,400
thinking but it seems like there is some
 

7893
02:15:22,400 --> 02:15:24,950
thinking but it seems like there is some
conclusion to be drawn there oh yeah i

7894
02:15:24,950 --> 02:15:24,960
conclusion to be drawn there oh yeah i
 

7895
02:15:24,960 --> 02:15:27,350
conclusion to be drawn there oh yeah i
believe you need to the high percentage

7896
02:15:27,350 --> 02:15:27,360
believe you need to the high percentage
 

7897
02:15:27,360 --> 02:15:29,270
believe you need to the high percentage
move there's a reason why it works i

7898
02:15:29,270 --> 02:15:29,280
move there's a reason why it works i
 

7899
02:15:29,280 --> 02:15:30,629
move there's a reason why it works i
think it's

7900
02:15:30,629 --> 02:15:30,639
think it's
 

7901
02:15:30,639 --> 02:15:31,830
think it's
it's made

7902
02:15:31,830 --> 02:15:31,840
it's made
 

7903
02:15:31,840 --> 02:15:35,030
it's made
for a bigger amount of people um

7904
02:15:35,030 --> 02:15:35,040
for a bigger amount of people um
 

7905
02:15:35,040 --> 02:15:37,589
for a bigger amount of people um
for example i i one of my main

7906
02:15:37,589 --> 02:15:37,599
for example i i one of my main
 

7907
02:15:37,599 --> 02:15:38,790
for example i i one of my main
strength

7908
02:15:38,790 --> 02:15:38,800
strength
 

7909
02:15:38,800 --> 02:15:40,390
strength
uh athletic strength is i'm i'm an

7910
02:15:40,390 --> 02:15:40,400
uh athletic strength is i'm i'm an
 

7911
02:15:40,400 --> 02:15:43,109
uh athletic strength is i'm i'm an
explosive person so i'll use technique

7912
02:15:43,109 --> 02:15:43,119
explosive person so i'll use technique
 

7913
02:15:43,119 --> 02:15:45,430
explosive person so i'll use technique
that are explosive if i get a single leg

7914
02:15:45,430 --> 02:15:45,440
that are explosive if i get a single leg
 

7915
02:15:45,440 --> 02:15:47,669
that are explosive if i get a single leg
my my one of my thing i like to do is to

7916
02:15:47,669 --> 02:15:47,679
my my one of my thing i like to do is to
 

7917
02:15:47,679 --> 02:15:50,790
my my one of my thing i like to do is to
go for the double power double but for

7918
02:15:50,790 --> 02:15:50,800
go for the double power double but for
 

7919
02:15:50,800 --> 02:15:51,830
go for the double power double but for
uh

7920
02:15:51,830 --> 02:15:51,840
uh
 

7921
02:15:51,840 --> 02:15:54,310
uh
someone else who got for example in a

7922
02:15:54,310 --> 02:15:54,320
someone else who got for example in a
 

7923
02:15:54,320 --> 02:15:57,030
someone else who got for example in a
single leg position maybe he likes

7924
02:15:57,030 --> 02:15:57,040
single leg position maybe he likes
 

7925
02:15:57,040 --> 02:15:59,430
single leg position maybe he likes
like body true better he's more a greco

7926
02:15:59,430 --> 02:15:59,440
like body true better he's more a greco
 

7927
02:15:59,440 --> 02:16:01,589
like body true better he's more a greco
guy like so he or he's a judo guy he's

7928
02:16:01,589 --> 02:16:01,599
guy like so he or he's a judo guy he's
 

7929
02:16:01,599 --> 02:16:04,470
guy like so he or he's a judo guy he's
going to go for some something else so

7930
02:16:04,470 --> 02:16:04,480
going to go for some something else so
 

7931
02:16:04,480 --> 02:16:06,790
going to go for some something else so
but there is move that are i would say

7932
02:16:06,790 --> 02:16:06,800
but there is move that are i would say
 

7933
02:16:06,800 --> 02:16:08,870
but there is move that are i would say
like you just mentioned are universal

7934
02:16:08,870 --> 02:16:08,880
like you just mentioned are universal
 

7935
02:16:08,880 --> 02:16:11,750
like you just mentioned are universal
like statistically speaking they're

7936
02:16:11,750 --> 02:16:11,760
like statistically speaking they're
 

7937
02:16:11,760 --> 02:16:13,750
like statistically speaking they're
the highest percentage move that works

7938
02:16:13,750 --> 02:16:13,760
the highest percentage move that works
 

7939
02:16:13,760 --> 02:16:15,750
the highest percentage move that works
for pretty much everybody everybody

7940
02:16:15,750 --> 02:16:15,760
for pretty much everybody everybody
 

7941
02:16:15,760 --> 02:16:18,870
for pretty much everybody everybody
pretty much can do a an adequate jimmy

7942
02:16:18,870 --> 02:16:18,880
pretty much can do a an adequate jimmy
 

7943
02:16:18,880 --> 02:16:20,550
pretty much can do a an adequate jimmy
you know it's very easy

7944
02:16:20,550 --> 02:16:20,560
you know it's very easy
 

7945
02:16:20,560 --> 02:16:22,709
you know it's very easy
but it's not everybody that can lock a

7946
02:16:22,709 --> 02:16:22,719
but it's not everybody that can lock a
 

7947
02:16:22,719 --> 02:16:25,669
but it's not everybody that can lock a
triangle with their legs so

7948
02:16:25,669 --> 02:16:25,679
triangle with their legs so
 

7949
02:16:25,679 --> 02:16:28,069
triangle with their legs so
so those move like a rear naked choke a

7950
02:16:28,069 --> 02:16:28,079
so those move like a rear naked choke a
 

7951
02:16:28,079 --> 02:16:30,629
so those move like a rear naked choke a
dakajimi is the highest percentage move

7952
02:16:30,629 --> 02:16:30,639
dakajimi is the highest percentage move
 

7953
02:16:30,639 --> 02:16:33,669
dakajimi is the highest percentage move
because it's maybe more accessible

7954
02:16:33,669 --> 02:16:33,679
because it's maybe more accessible
 

7955
02:16:33,679 --> 02:16:35,750
because it's maybe more accessible
it's accessible for a bigger range yeah

7956
02:16:35,750 --> 02:16:35,760
it's accessible for a bigger range yeah
 

7957
02:16:35,760 --> 02:16:37,429
it's accessible for a bigger range yeah
based on the physical characteristics of

7958
02:16:37,429 --> 02:16:37,439
based on the physical characteristics of
 

7959
02:16:37,439 --> 02:16:39,110
based on the physical characteristics of
the people do you draw in your wisdom

7960
02:16:39,110 --> 02:16:39,120
the people do you draw in your wisdom
 

7961
02:16:39,120 --> 02:16:41,669
the people do you draw in your wisdom
from these high percentages john uh for

7962
02:16:41,669 --> 02:16:41,679
from these high percentages john uh for
 

7963
02:16:41,679 --> 02:16:44,469
from these high percentages john uh for
like in terms of what to focus on yeah

7964
02:16:44,469 --> 02:16:44,479
like in terms of what to focus on yeah
 

7965
02:16:44,479 --> 02:16:46,950
like in terms of what to focus on yeah
absolutely um jiu jitsu has an ocean of

7966
02:16:46,950 --> 02:16:46,960
absolutely um jiu jitsu has an ocean of
 

7967
02:16:46,960 --> 02:16:49,910
absolutely um jiu jitsu has an ocean of
moves and you can get lost on that ocean

7968
02:16:49,910 --> 02:16:49,920
moves and you can get lost on that ocean
 

7969
02:16:49,920 --> 02:16:51,750
moves and you can get lost on that ocean
you can drift for a long period of time

7970
02:16:51,750 --> 02:16:51,760
you can drift for a long period of time
 

7971
02:16:51,760 --> 02:16:53,669
you can drift for a long period of time
and and end up with very little to show

7972
02:16:53,669 --> 02:16:53,679
and and end up with very little to show
 

7973
02:16:53,679 --> 02:16:56,389
and and end up with very little to show
for it so my whole thing is focus we

7974
02:16:56,389 --> 02:16:56,399
for it so my whole thing is focus we
 

7975
02:16:56,399 --> 02:16:58,150
for it so my whole thing is focus we
only live one lifetime

7976
02:16:58,150 --> 02:16:58,160
only live one lifetime
 

7977
02:16:58,160 --> 02:17:00,070
only live one lifetime
and your training lifetime is even

7978
02:17:00,070 --> 02:17:00,080
and your training lifetime is even
 

7979
02:17:00,080 --> 02:17:02,230
and your training lifetime is even
shorter than your actual lifetime

7980
02:17:02,230 --> 02:17:02,240
shorter than your actual lifetime
 

7981
02:17:02,240 --> 02:17:03,110
shorter than your actual lifetime
so

7982
02:17:03,110 --> 02:17:03,120
so
 

7983
02:17:03,120 --> 02:17:04,629
so
in that time

7984
02:17:04,629 --> 02:17:04,639
in that time
 

7985
02:17:04,639 --> 02:17:07,669
in that time
i must die on the mat

7986
02:17:07,669 --> 02:17:07,679
i must die on the mat
 

7987
02:17:07,679 --> 02:17:09,509
i must die on the mat
that's just the same

7988
02:17:09,509 --> 02:17:09,519
that's just the same
 

7989
02:17:09,519 --> 02:17:10,389
that's just the same
um

7990
02:17:10,389 --> 02:17:10,399
um
 

7991
02:17:10,399 --> 02:17:13,750
um
uh i i put a very high

7992
02:17:13,750 --> 02:17:13,760
uh i i put a very high
 

7993
02:17:13,760 --> 02:17:15,669
uh i i put a very high
value on

7994
02:17:15,669 --> 02:17:15,679
value on
 

7995
02:17:15,679 --> 02:17:17,589
value on
choosing what i believe to be the most

7996
02:17:17,589 --> 02:17:17,599
choosing what i believe to be the most
 

7997
02:17:17,599 --> 02:17:19,990
choosing what i believe to be the most
high percentage

7998
02:17:19,990 --> 02:17:20,000
high percentage
 

7999
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,150
high percentage
moves and putting an extraordinary

8000
02:17:22,150 --> 02:17:22,160
moves and putting an extraordinary
 

8001
02:17:22,160 --> 02:17:24,309
moves and putting an extraordinary
amount of focus on them

8002
02:17:24,309 --> 02:17:24,319
amount of focus on them
 

8003
02:17:24,319 --> 02:17:26,389
amount of focus on them
the only problem is that in one

8004
02:17:26,389 --> 02:17:26,399
the only problem is that in one
 

8005
02:17:26,399 --> 02:17:27,910
the only problem is that in one
generation a move which can be

8006
02:17:27,910 --> 02:17:27,920
generation a move which can be
 

8007
02:17:27,920 --> 02:17:29,669
generation a move which can be
considered low percentage might actually

8008
02:17:29,669 --> 02:17:29,679
considered low percentage might actually
 

8009
02:17:29,679 --> 02:17:31,349
considered low percentage might actually
turn out to be high percentage in

8010
02:17:31,349 --> 02:17:31,359
turn out to be high percentage in
 

8011
02:17:31,359 --> 02:17:33,750
turn out to be high percentage in
another generation for example we talked

8012
02:17:33,750 --> 02:17:33,760
another generation for example we talked
 

8013
02:17:33,760 --> 02:17:35,669
another generation for example we talked
earlier about leg locks when i was first

8014
02:17:35,669 --> 02:17:35,679
earlier about leg locks when i was first
 

8015
02:17:35,679 --> 02:17:36,950
earlier about leg locks when i was first
started you said they were considered

8016
02:17:36,950 --> 02:17:36,960
started you said they were considered
 

8017
02:17:36,960 --> 02:17:40,150
started you said they were considered
the ultimate low percentage move and

8018
02:17:40,150 --> 02:17:40,160
the ultimate low percentage move and
 

8019
02:17:40,160 --> 02:17:41,830
the ultimate low percentage move and
a big part of my career has been

8020
02:17:41,830 --> 02:17:41,840
a big part of my career has been
 

8021
02:17:41,840 --> 02:17:43,910
a big part of my career has been
convincing people that in fact that was

8022
02:17:43,910 --> 02:17:43,920
convincing people that in fact that was
 

8023
02:17:43,920 --> 02:17:45,750
convincing people that in fact that was
that was incorrect that they can be a

8024
02:17:45,750 --> 02:17:45,760
that was incorrect that they can be a
 

8025
02:17:45,760 --> 02:17:47,669
that was incorrect that they can be a
high percentage move if we just change

8026
02:17:47,669 --> 02:17:47,679
high percentage move if we just change
 

8027
02:17:47,679 --> 02:17:49,349
high percentage move if we just change
our approach to them

8028
02:17:49,349 --> 02:17:49,359
our approach to them
 

8029
02:17:49,359 --> 02:17:50,389
our approach to them
um

8030
02:17:50,389 --> 02:17:50,399
um
 

8031
02:17:50,399 --> 02:17:52,070
um
so we can't just

8032
02:17:52,070 --> 02:17:52,080
so we can't just
 

8033
02:17:52,080 --> 02:17:53,750
so we can't just
follow tradition

8034
02:17:53,750 --> 02:17:53,760
follow tradition
 

8035
02:17:53,760 --> 02:17:55,349
follow tradition
and say oh this is low percentage this

8036
02:17:55,349 --> 02:17:55,359
and say oh this is low percentage this
 

8037
02:17:55,359 --> 02:17:57,110
and say oh this is low percentage this
is a high percentage it has to be part

8038
02:17:57,110 --> 02:17:57,120
is a high percentage it has to be part
 

8039
02:17:57,120 --> 02:17:58,070
is a high percentage it has to be part
of

8040
02:17:58,070 --> 02:17:58,080
of
 

8041
02:17:58,080 --> 02:18:00,709
of

the single most high percentage way of
 

8059
02:18:16,960 --> 02:18:18,309
the single most high percentage way of
taking them down is to get a hold of

taking them down is to get a hold of
 

8061
02:18:18,319 --> 02:18:19,509
taking them down is to get a hold of
both of their legs and push them

8062
02:18:19,509 --> 02:18:19,519
both of their legs and push them
 

8063
02:18:19,519 --> 02:18:20,870
both of their legs and push them
backwards

use their other leg to defend themselves
and hop around and funk their way out of

and hop around and funk their way out of
 

8073
02:18:28,160 --> 02:18:29,429
and hop around and funk their way out of
takedowns and cause all kinds of

takedowns and cause all kinds of
 

8075
02:18:29,439 --> 02:18:31,270
takedowns and cause all kinds of

of both of his legs and start pushing
 

8083
02:18:36,240 --> 02:18:37,669
of both of his legs and start pushing
him backwards he's going to fall down to

8084
02:18:37,669 --> 02:18:37,679
him backwards he's going to fall down to
 

8085
02:18:37,679 --> 02:18:38,469
him backwards he's going to fall down to
his butt

his butt
 

8087
02:18:38,479 --> 02:18:39,830
his butt
now he might be able to recover from

8088
02:18:39,830 --> 02:18:39,840
now he might be able to recover from
 

8089
02:18:39,840 --> 02:18:42,389
now he might be able to recover from
there but he will fall down

there but he will fall down
 

8091
02:18:42,399 --> 02:18:44,469
there but he will fall down
even easier than that is to be behind

8092
02:18:44,469 --> 02:18:44,479
even easier than that is to be behind
 

8093
02:18:44,479 --> 02:18:45,509
even easier than that is to be behind
someone

return this is significantly easier than
 

8109
02:18:59,760 --> 02:19:01,910

you don't have to worry about shooting

8120
02:19:10,709 --> 02:19:10,719
you don't have to worry about shooting
 

8121
02:19:10,719 --> 02:19:12,709
you don't have to worry about shooting
anymore there's no sprawl out of that

8122
02:19:12,709 --> 02:19:12,719
anymore there's no sprawl out of that
 

8123
02:19:12,719 --> 02:19:13,509
anymore there's no sprawl out of that
you don't have to worry about

you don't have to worry about
guillotines kimuras or the

02:19:15,589 --> 02:19:15,599
guillotines kimuras or the
 

8127
02:19:15,599 --> 02:19:17,190
guillotines kimuras or the
standard defenses those will

8128

standard defenses those will

standard defenses those will
intrinsically be easier takedowns out of

8130
02:19:19,429 --> 02:19:19,439
intrinsically be easier takedowns out of
 

8131
02:19:19,439 --> 02:19:21,270
intrinsically be easier takedowns out of
front headlock and so if we're going to

8132
02:19:21,270 --> 02:19:21,280
front headlock and so if we're going to
 

8133
02:19:21,280 --> 02:19:23,030
front headlock and so if we're going to
talk about high percentage technique i

8134
02:19:23,030 --> 02:19:23,040
talk about high percentage technique i
 

8135
02:19:23,040 --> 02:19:25,349
talk about high percentage technique i
always go back to the mechanics of it

8136
02:19:25,349 --> 02:19:25,359
always go back to the mechanics of it
 

8137
02:19:25,359 --> 02:19:27,110
always go back to the mechanics of it
rather than just historical tradition

8138
02:19:27,110 --> 02:19:27,120
rather than just historical tradition
 

8139
02:19:27,120 --> 02:19:29,429
rather than just historical tradition
because historical tradition can be

8140
02:19:29,429 --> 02:19:29,439
because historical tradition can be
 

8141
02:19:29,439 --> 02:19:31,990
because historical tradition can be
wrong it was wrong about leglocks it

8142
02:19:31,990 --> 02:19:32,000
wrong it was wrong about leglocks it
 

8143
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,230
wrong it was wrong about leglocks it
could be wrong about other things too so

8144
02:19:34,230 --> 02:19:34,240
could be wrong about other things too so
 

8145
02:19:34,240 --> 02:19:35,990
could be wrong about other things too so
my primary thing is okay talk to me

8146
02:19:35,990 --> 02:19:36,000
my primary thing is okay talk to me
 

8147
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:37,910
my primary thing is okay talk to me
about mechanics

8148

about mechanics
 

8149
02:19:37,920 --> 02:19:39,030
about mechanics
that's what ultimately is going to

8150
02:19:39,030 --> 02:19:39,040
that's what ultimately is going to
 

8151
02:19:39,040 --> 02:19:40,309
that's what ultimately is going to
determine whether something is high

8152
02:19:40,309 --> 02:19:40,319
determine whether something is high
 

8153
02:19:40,319 --> 02:19:42,790
determine whether something is high

if you get behind someone take downs are
 

8177
02:20:03,600 --> 02:20:05,270
if you get behind someone take downs are
ten times easier from behind someone

ten times easier from behind someone

it's much easier because most of the

it's much easier because most of the
 

8201
02:20:25,200 --> 02:20:27,349
it's much easier because most of the
defensive apparatus has been taken away

8202
02:20:27,349 --> 02:20:27,359
defensive apparatus has been taken away
 

8203
02:20:27,359 --> 02:20:29,030
defensive apparatus has been taken away
from them before the takedown even

8204
02:20:29,030 --> 02:20:29,040
from them before the takedown even
 

8205
02:20:29,040 --> 02:20:31,030
from them before the takedown even
begins and so

8206
02:20:31,030 --> 02:20:31,040
begins and so
 

8207
02:20:31,040 --> 02:20:32,389
begins and so
for me the most high percentage

8208
02:20:32,389 --> 02:20:32,399
for me the most high percentage
 

8209
02:20:32,399 --> 02:20:34,630
for me the most high percentage
takedowns will always be from the front

8210
02:20:34,630 --> 02:20:34,640
takedowns will always be from the front
 

8211
02:20:34,640 --> 02:20:37,190
takedowns will always be from the front
double legs from any takedown from the

8212
02:20:37,190 --> 02:20:37,200
double legs from any takedown from the
 

8213
02:20:37,200 --> 02:20:38,870
double legs from any takedown from the
back is going to be significantly easier

8214
02:20:38,870 --> 02:20:38,880
back is going to be significantly easier
 

8215
02:20:38,880 --> 02:20:40,870
back is going to be significantly easier
than any takedown from the front so all

8216
02:20:40,870 --> 02:20:40,880
than any takedown from the front so all
 

8217
02:20:40,880 --> 02:20:42,790
than any takedown from the front so all
manner of mat return takedowns are going

8218
02:20:42,790 --> 02:20:42,800
manner of mat return takedowns are going
 

8219
02:20:42,800 --> 02:20:45,750
manner of mat return takedowns are going
to be very high percentage

8220
02:20:45,750 --> 02:20:45,760
to be very high percentage
 

8221
02:20:45,760 --> 02:20:47,590
to be very high percentage
and takedowns done out of situations

8222
02:20:47,590 --> 02:20:47,600
and takedowns done out of situations
 

8223
02:20:47,600 --> 02:20:49,270
and takedowns done out of situations
where the opponent is broken down in

8224
02:20:49,270 --> 02:20:49,280
where the opponent is broken down in
 

8225
02:20:49,280 --> 02:20:50,710
where the opponent is broken down in
front of you and you have either front

8226
02:20:50,710 --> 02:20:50,720
front of you and you have either front
 

8227
02:20:50,720 --> 02:20:52,790
front of you and you have either front
headlock or front chest right position

8228
02:20:52,790 --> 02:20:52,800
headlock or front chest right position
 

8229
02:20:52,800 --> 02:20:54,230
headlock or front chest right position
are going to be significantly easier

8230
02:20:54,230 --> 02:20:54,240
are going to be significantly easier
 

8231
02:20:54,240 --> 02:20:56,389
are going to be significantly easier
than takedowns from the open

8232
02:20:56,389 --> 02:20:56,399
than takedowns from the open
 

8233
02:20:56,399 --> 02:20:57,429
than takedowns from the open
of course

8234
02:20:57,429 --> 02:20:57,439
of course
 

8235
02:20:57,439 --> 02:20:59,990
of course
you have to consider the full

8236
02:20:59,990 --> 02:21:00,000
you have to consider the full
 

8237
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:01,830
you have to consider the full
spectrum of mechanics involved here it's

8238
02:21:01,830 --> 02:21:01,840
spectrum of mechanics involved here it's
 

8239
02:21:01,840 --> 02:21:04,389
spectrum of mechanics involved here it's
possible that an outside low single

8240
02:21:04,389 --> 02:21:04,399
possible that an outside low single
 

8241
02:21:04,399 --> 02:21:06,070
possible that an outside low single
leading to a double leg is much higher

8242
02:21:06,070 --> 02:21:06,080
leading to a double leg is much higher
 

8243
02:21:06,080 --> 02:21:08,389
leading to a double leg is much higher
percentage it's like there's a lot of

8244
02:21:08,389 --> 02:21:08,399
percentage it's like there's a lot of
 

8245
02:21:08,399 --> 02:21:10,550
percentage it's like there's a lot of
chain wrestling yet you know that needs

8246
02:21:10,550 --> 02:21:10,560
chain wrestling yet you know that needs
 

8247
02:21:10,560 --> 02:21:12,550
chain wrestling yet you know that needs
to be considered as a possibility maybe

8248
02:21:12,550 --> 02:21:12,560
to be considered as a possibility maybe
 

8249
02:21:12,560 --> 02:21:13,990
to be considered as a possibility maybe
a straight-on double and part of this

8250
02:21:13,990 --> 02:21:14,000
a straight-on double and part of this
 

8251
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:15,270
a straight-on double and part of this
cultural too

8252
02:21:15,270 --> 02:21:15,280
cultural too
 

8253
02:21:15,280 --> 02:21:17,030
cultural too
are people afraid of this kind of thing

8254
02:21:17,030 --> 02:21:17,040
are people afraid of this kind of thing
 

8255
02:21:17,040 --> 02:21:18,790
are people afraid of this kind of thing
that they came to be the case with

8256
02:21:18,790 --> 02:21:18,800
that they came to be the case with
 

8257
02:21:18,800 --> 02:21:21,670
that they came to be the case with
leglocks are people aware of this

8258
02:21:21,670 --> 02:21:21,680
leglocks are people aware of this
 

8259
02:21:21,680 --> 02:21:23,349
leglocks are people aware of this
are they worried about this are they

8260
02:21:23,349 --> 02:21:23,359
are they worried about this are they
 

8261
02:21:23,359 --> 02:21:25,510
are they worried about this are they
training for this to defend this

8262
02:21:25,510 --> 02:21:25,520
training for this to defend this
 

8263
02:21:25,520 --> 02:21:28,150
training for this to defend this
and then his opponent specific of course

8264
02:21:28,150 --> 02:21:28,160
and then his opponent specific of course
 

8265
02:21:28,160 --> 02:21:29,349
and then his opponent specific of course
that um

8266
02:21:29,349 --> 02:21:29,359
that um
 

8267
02:21:29,359 --> 02:21:30,790

you know with jordan barros people are

8268
02:21:30,790 --> 02:21:30,800
you know with jordan barros people are
 

8269
02:21:30,800 --> 02:21:32,309
you know with jordan barros people are
preparing for the double which is why he

8270
02:21:32,309 --> 02:21:32,319
preparing for the double which is why he
 

8271
02:21:32,319 --> 02:21:34,790
preparing for the double which is why he
had to develop

8272
02:21:34,790 --> 02:21:34,800
had to develop
 

8273
02:21:34,800 --> 02:21:36,870
had to develop
a whole other kinds of different stuff

8274
02:21:36,870 --> 02:21:36,880
a whole other kinds of different stuff
 

8275
02:21:36,880 --> 02:21:38,550
a whole other kinds of different stuff
and then the head to all the different

8276
02:21:38,550 --> 02:21:38,560
and then the head to all the different
 

8277
02:21:38,560 --> 02:21:40,469
and then the head to all the different
controls all the different ties

8278
02:21:40,469 --> 02:21:40,479
controls all the different ties
 

8279
02:21:40,479 --> 02:21:42,389
controls all the different ties
within the rule set

8280
02:21:42,389 --> 02:21:42,399
within the rule set
 

8281
02:21:42,399 --> 02:21:43,910
within the rule set
and that's where it's so fascinating to

8282
02:21:43,910 --> 02:21:43,920
and that's where it's so fascinating to
 

8283
02:21:43,920 --> 02:21:46,070
and that's where it's so fascinating to
see the effect of rule set and all this

8284
02:21:46,070 --> 02:21:46,080
see the effect of rule set and all this
 

8285
02:21:46,080 --> 02:21:49,590
see the effect of rule set and all this
judo over the past i think 20 years went

8286
02:21:49,590 --> 02:21:49,600
judo over the past i think 20 years went
 

8287
02:21:49,600 --> 02:21:51,990
judo over the past i think 20 years went
through this every olympics different

8288
02:21:51,990 --> 02:21:52,000
through this every olympics different
 

8289
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:53,270
through this every olympics different
changes to the rule set like

8290
02:21:53,270 --> 02:21:53,280
changes to the rule set like
 

8291
02:21:53,280 --> 02:21:55,190
changes to the rule set like
fundamentally different in terms of

8292
02:21:55,190 --> 02:21:55,200
fundamentally different in terms of
 

8293
02:21:55,200 --> 02:21:56,710
fundamentally different in terms of
what's allowed to grip whether you're

8294
02:21:56,710 --> 02:21:56,720
what's allowed to grip whether you're
 

8295
02:21:56,720 --> 02:21:58,309
what's allowed to grip whether you're
allowed to touch the legs at all that

8296
02:21:58,309 --> 02:21:58,319
allowed to touch the legs at all that
 

8297
02:21:58,319 --> 02:22:01,910
allowed to touch the legs at all that
was a big one in 2012 i think

8298
02:22:01,910 --> 02:22:01,920
was a big one in 2012 i think
 

8299
02:22:01,920 --> 02:22:03,190
was a big one in 2012 i think
and and that changes the sport

8300
02:22:03,190 --> 02:22:03,200
and and that changes the sport
 

8301
02:22:03,200 --> 02:22:05,349
and and that changes the sport
completely and so interesting it's so

8302
02:22:05,349 --> 02:22:05,359
completely and so interesting it's so
 

8303
02:22:05,359 --> 02:22:07,750
completely and so interesting it's so
interesting to watch how tiny change in

8304
02:22:07,750 --> 02:22:07,760
interesting to watch how tiny change in
 

8305
02:22:07,760 --> 02:22:10,230
interesting to watch how tiny change in
the rule can change in sport

8306
02:22:10,230 --> 02:22:10,240
the rule can change in sport
 

8307
02:22:10,240 --> 02:22:12,070
the rule can change in sport
at the highest when you're talking about

8308
02:22:12,070 --> 02:22:12,080
at the highest when you're talking about
 

8309
02:22:12,080 --> 02:22:14,550
at the highest when you're talking about
people competing at the highest level

8310
02:22:14,550 --> 02:22:14,560
people competing at the highest level
 

8311
02:22:14,560 --> 02:22:17,990
people competing at the highest level
and the cool thing there is

8312
02:22:17,990 --> 02:22:18,000
and the cool thing there is
 

8313
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:19,830
and the cool thing there is
the rule change happens on a scale of

8314
02:22:19,830 --> 02:22:19,840
the rule change happens on a scale of
 

8315
02:22:19,840 --> 02:22:21,510
the rule change happens on a scale of
every four years

8316
02:22:21,510 --> 02:22:21,520
every four years
 

8317
02:22:21,520 --> 02:22:23,910
every four years
so you get to see people that are at the

8318
02:22:23,910 --> 02:22:23,920
so you get to see people that are at the
 

8319
02:22:23,920 --> 02:22:25,429
so you get to see people that are at the
top of their game

8320
02:22:25,429 --> 02:22:25,439
top of their game
 

8321
02:22:25,439 --> 02:22:27,830
top of their game
have to like recompute

8322
02:22:27,830 --> 02:22:27,840
have to like recompute
 

8323
02:22:27,840 --> 02:22:28,870
have to like recompute
so it's not like you have a new

8324
02:22:28,870 --> 02:22:28,880
so it's not like you have a new
 

8325
02:22:28,880 --> 02:22:30,070
so it's not like you have a new
generation of people coming up with the

8326
02:22:30,070 --> 02:22:30,080
generation of people coming up with the
 

8327
02:22:30,080 --> 02:22:31,670
generation of people coming up with the
rules they have to figure oh [\h__\h] you're

8328
02:22:31,670 --> 02:22:31,680
rules they have to figure oh [\h__\h] you're
 

8329
02:22:31,680 --> 02:22:33,830
rules they have to figure oh [\h__\h] you're
not allowed to like it's it's the

8330
02:22:33,830 --> 02:22:33,840
not allowed to like it's it's the
 

8331
02:22:33,840 --> 02:22:35,429
not allowed to like it's it's the
equivalent of saying you're not allowed

8332
02:22:35,429 --> 02:22:35,439
equivalent of saying you're not allowed
 

8333
02:22:35,439 --> 02:22:37,670
equivalent of saying you're not allowed
to kick anymore in mma

8334
02:22:37,670 --> 02:22:37,680
to kick anymore in mma
 

8335
02:22:37,680 --> 02:22:39,429
to kick anymore in mma
because you were not allowed to grab

8336
02:22:39,429 --> 02:22:39,439
because you were not allowed to grab
 

8337
02:22:39,439 --> 02:22:41,349
because you were not allowed to grab
legs anymore in judo

8338
02:22:41,349 --> 02:22:41,359
legs anymore in judo
 

8339
02:22:41,359 --> 02:22:44,309
legs anymore in judo
interestingly if you look at the

8340
02:22:44,309 --> 02:22:44,319
interestingly if you look at the
 

8341
02:22:44,319 --> 02:22:45,830
interestingly if you look at the
case of judo

8342
02:22:45,830 --> 02:22:45,840
case of judo
 

8343
02:22:45,840 --> 02:22:48,469
case of judo
if you look at the world rankings

8344
02:22:48,469 --> 02:22:48,479
if you look at the world rankings
 

8345
02:22:48,479 --> 02:22:51,030
if you look at the world rankings
of athletes when they went through one

8346
02:22:51,030 --> 02:22:51,040
of athletes when they went through one
 

8347
02:22:51,040 --> 02:22:53,750
of athletes when they went through one
of the most significant rule changes in

8348
02:22:53,750 --> 02:22:53,760
of the most significant rule changes in
 

8349
02:22:53,760 --> 02:22:56,309
of the most significant rule changes in
judo history where they banned any form

8350
02:22:56,309 --> 02:22:56,319
judo history where they banned any form
 

8351
02:22:56,319 --> 02:22:58,630
judo history where they banned any form
of grabbing the legs

8352
02:22:58,630 --> 02:22:58,640
of grabbing the legs
 

8353
02:22:58,640 --> 02:23:01,110
of grabbing the legs
the ranking of athletes didn't change

8354
02:23:01,110 --> 02:23:01,120
the ranking of athletes didn't change
 

8355
02:23:01,120 --> 02:23:02,630
the ranking of athletes didn't change
much

8356
02:23:02,630 --> 02:23:02,640
much
 

8357
02:23:02,640 --> 02:23:04,550
much
yeah that tells you that they're um

8358
02:23:04,550 --> 02:23:04,560
yeah that tells you that they're um
 

8359
02:23:04,560 --> 02:23:05,990
yeah that tells you that they're um
there's a reason why those guys are at

8360
02:23:05,990 --> 02:23:06,000
there's a reason why those guys are at
 

8361
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,150
there's a reason why those guys are at
the top yeah and it doesn't have to do

8362
02:23:08,150 --> 02:23:08,160
the top yeah and it doesn't have to do
 

8363
02:23:08,160 --> 02:23:10,550
the top yeah and it doesn't have to do
that they're specific to a rule set

8364
02:23:10,550 --> 02:23:10,560
that they're specific to a rule set
 

8365
02:23:10,560 --> 02:23:13,190
that they're specific to a rule set
yeah think about that in terms of

8366
02:23:13,190 --> 02:23:13,200
yeah think about that in terms of
 

8367
02:23:13,200 --> 02:23:14,950
yeah think about that in terms of
imagine for example in mixed martial

8368
02:23:14,950 --> 02:23:14,960
imagine for example in mixed martial
 

8369
02:23:14,960 --> 02:23:17,110
imagine for example in mixed martial
arts if they just said hey

8370
02:23:17,110 --> 02:23:17,120
arts if they just said hey
 

8371
02:23:17,120 --> 02:23:18,870
arts if they just said hey
starting next week

8372
02:23:18,870 --> 02:23:18,880
starting next week
 

8373
02:23:18,880 --> 02:23:20,230
starting next week
instead of having three five minute

8374
02:23:20,230 --> 02:23:20,240
instead of having three five minute
 

8375
02:23:20,240 --> 02:23:21,990
instead of having three five minute
rounds it's going to be 15 minutes

8376
02:23:21,990 --> 02:23:22,000
rounds it's going to be 15 minutes
 

8377
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:23,190
rounds it's going to be 15 minutes
straight

8378
02:23:23,190 --> 02:23:23,200
straight
 

8379
02:23:23,200 --> 02:23:25,270
straight
that would massively change the

8380
02:23:25,270 --> 02:23:25,280
that would massively change the
 

8381
02:23:25,280 --> 02:23:27,670
that would massively change the
preparation of the athletes

8382
02:23:27,670 --> 02:23:27,680
preparation of the athletes
 

8383
02:23:27,680 --> 02:23:29,270
preparation of the athletes
it's a different game at that point and

8384
02:23:29,270 --> 02:23:29,280
it's a different game at that point and
 

8385
02:23:29,280 --> 02:23:30,950
it's a different game at that point and
judo literally was a different game

8386
02:23:30,950 --> 02:23:30,960
judo literally was a different game
 

8387
02:23:30,960 --> 02:23:33,750
judo literally was a different game
before 2010 and after 2010

8388
02:23:33,750 --> 02:23:33,760
before 2010 and after 2010
 

8389
02:23:33,760 --> 02:23:35,190
before 2010 and after 2010
and yet

8390
02:23:35,190 --> 02:23:35,200
and yet
 

8391
02:23:35,200 --> 02:23:37,429
and yet
the international rankings didn't really

8392
02:23:37,429 --> 02:23:37,439
the international rankings didn't really
 

8393
02:23:37,439 --> 02:23:39,429
the international rankings didn't really
change that much the countries that were

8394
02:23:39,429 --> 02:23:39,439
change that much the countries that were
 

8395
02:23:39,439 --> 02:23:40,790
change that much the countries that were
dominant before

8396
02:23:40,790 --> 02:23:40,800
dominant before
 

8397
02:23:40,800 --> 02:23:42,870
dominant before
remain dominant the athletes that

8398
02:23:42,870 --> 02:23:42,880
remain dominant the athletes that
 

8399
02:23:42,880 --> 02:23:46,710
remain dominant the athletes that
remained before largely remain the same

8400
02:23:46,710 --> 02:23:46,720
remained before largely remain the same
 

8401
02:23:46,720 --> 02:23:48,710
remained before largely remain the same
you would think with such a massive

8402
02:23:48,710 --> 02:23:48,720
you would think with such a massive
 

8403
02:23:48,720 --> 02:23:50,469
you would think with such a massive
change all the rankings would have been

8404
02:23:50,469 --> 02:23:50,479
change all the rankings would have been
 

8405
02:23:50,479 --> 02:23:53,270
change all the rankings would have been
thrown upside down but they weren't and

8406
02:23:53,270 --> 02:23:53,280
thrown upside down but they weren't and
 

8407
02:23:53,280 --> 02:23:55,910
thrown upside down but they weren't and
uh again it goes back to this idea that

8408
02:23:55,910 --> 02:23:55,920
uh again it goes back to this idea that
 

8409
02:23:55,920 --> 02:23:57,990
uh again it goes back to this idea that
there's a reason why the guys at the top

8410
02:23:57,990 --> 02:23:58,000
there's a reason why the guys at the top
 

8411
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:00,070
there's a reason why the guys at the top
are at the top

8412
02:24:00,070 --> 02:24:00,080
are at the top
 

8413
02:24:00,080 --> 02:24:01,270
are at the top
and now for something completely

8414
02:24:01,270 --> 02:24:01,280
and now for something completely
 

8415
02:24:01,280 --> 02:24:04,070
and now for something completely
different we talked about aliens earlier

8416
02:24:04,070 --> 02:24:04,080
different we talked about aliens earlier
 

8417
02:24:04,080 --> 02:24:06,950
different we talked about aliens earlier
say uh george brought up bob lazar i i

8418
02:24:06,950 --> 02:24:06,960
say uh george brought up bob lazar i i
 

8419
02:24:06,960 --> 02:24:08,230
say uh george brought up bob lazar i i
um

8420
02:24:08,230 --> 02:24:08,240
um
 

8421
02:24:08,240 --> 02:24:10,070
um
we'll likely probably talk to bob lazar

8422
02:24:10,070 --> 02:24:10,080
we'll likely probably talk to bob lazar
 

8423
02:24:10,080 --> 02:24:11,500
we'll likely probably talk to bob lazar
on this podcast and then

8424
02:24:11,500 --> 02:24:11,510
on this podcast and then
 

8425
02:24:11,510 --> 02:24:13,110
on this podcast and then

and then john had a skeptical look on

8428
02:24:15,670 --> 02:24:15,680
and then john had a skeptical look on
 

8429
02:24:15,680 --> 02:24:18,230
and then john had a skeptical look on
his face about about aliens so let me

8430
02:24:18,230 --> 02:24:18,240
his face about about aliens so let me
 

8431
02:24:18,240 --> 02:24:20,790
his face about about aliens so let me
ask uh john and gordon

8432
02:24:20,790 --> 02:24:20,800
ask uh john and gordon
 

8433
02:24:20,800 --> 02:24:23,030
ask uh john and gordon
uh do you think there's intelligent

8434
02:24:23,030 --> 02:24:23,040
uh do you think there's intelligent
 

8435
02:24:23,040 --> 02:24:24,790
uh do you think there's intelligent
alien civilizations out there in the

8436
02:24:24,790 --> 02:24:24,800
alien civilizations out there in the
 

8437
02:24:24,800 --> 02:24:27,910
alien civilizations out there in the
universe outside of our own the universe

8438
02:24:27,910 --> 02:24:27,920
universe outside of our own the universe
 

8439
02:24:27,920 --> 02:24:31,510
universe outside of our own the universe
is unimaginably large the idea that we

8440
02:24:31,510 --> 02:24:31,520
is unimaginably large the idea that we
 

8441
02:24:31,520 --> 02:24:34,550
is unimaginably large the idea that we
are the only life forms in a cosmos as

8442
02:24:34,550 --> 02:24:34,560
are the only life forms in a cosmos as

large as this
is

8446
02:24:37,830 --> 02:24:37,840
is
 

8447
02:24:37,840 --> 02:24:39,910
is
i think naive and foolish

8448
02:24:39,910 --> 02:24:39,920
i think naive and foolish
 

8449
02:24:39,920 --> 02:24:41,830
i think naive and foolish
um

8450
02:24:41,830 --> 02:24:41,840
um
 

8451
02:24:41,840 --> 02:24:43,750
um
there's a very high likelihood that if

8452
02:24:43,750 --> 02:24:43,760
there's a very high likelihood that if
 

8453
02:24:43,760 --> 02:24:46,469
there's a very high likelihood that if
life could evolve on this planet that it

8454
02:24:46,469 --> 02:24:46,479
life could evolve on this planet that it
 

8455
02:24:46,479 --> 02:24:48,469
life could evolve on this planet that it
could have done so on many many other

8456
02:24:48,469 --> 02:24:48,479
could have done so on many many other
 

8457
02:24:48,479 --> 02:24:50,630
could have done so on many many other
planets around the uh around the

8458
02:24:50,630 --> 02:24:50,640
planets around the uh around the
 

8459
02:24:50,640 --> 02:24:53,590
planets around the uh around the
consoles i think anyone who puts even a

8462
02:24:55,270 --> 02:24:55,280
moment's thought into this would realize
 

8463
02:24:55,280 --> 02:24:56,550
moment's thought into this would realize
that there's

8464
02:24:56,550 --> 02:24:56,560
that there's
 

8465
02:24:56,560 --> 02:24:58,630
that there's
almost certainly other forms of life out

8466
02:24:58,630 --> 02:24:58,640
almost certainly other forms of life out
 

8467
02:24:58,640 --> 02:24:59,750
almost certainly other forms of life out
there

8468
02:24:59,750 --> 02:24:59,760
there
 

8469
02:24:59,760 --> 02:25:02,630
there
the real question with regards the alien

8470
02:25:02,630 --> 02:25:02,640
the real question with regards the alien
 

8471
02:25:02,640 --> 02:25:05,190
the real question with regards the alien
community is um have they got here and

8472
02:25:05,190 --> 02:25:05,200
community is um have they got here and
 

8473
02:25:05,200 --> 02:25:07,429
community is um have they got here and
are they surfing our planet

8474
02:25:07,429 --> 02:25:07,439
are they surfing our planet
 

8475
02:25:07,439 --> 02:25:10,469
are they surfing our planet

has come out showing
 

8495
02:25:29,200 --> 02:25:31,349
has come out showing
some very interesting phenomena if you

8496
02:25:31,349 --> 02:25:31,359
some very interesting phenomena if you
 

8497
02:25:31,359 --> 02:25:33,750
some very interesting phenomena if you
talk to almost any experienced pilot

8498
02:25:33,750 --> 02:25:33,760
talk to almost any experienced pilot
 

8499
02:25:33,760 --> 02:25:36,070
talk to almost any experienced pilot
they will tell you they've seen things

8500
02:25:36,070 --> 02:25:36,080
they will tell you they've seen things
 

8501
02:25:36,080 --> 02:25:38,070
they will tell you they've seen things
in the upper atmosphere that are very

8502
02:25:38,070 --> 02:25:38,080
in the upper atmosphere that are very
 

8503
02:25:38,080 --> 02:25:40,150
in the upper atmosphere that are very
difficult to explain uh i'll be the

8504
02:25:40,150 --> 02:25:40,160
difficult to explain uh i'll be the
 

8505
02:25:40,160 --> 02:25:41,510
difficult to explain uh i'll be the
first one to agree with you on this

8506
02:25:41,510 --> 02:25:41,520
first one to agree with you on this
 

8507
02:25:41,520 --> 02:25:42,950
first one to agree with you on this
there are some things out there that are

8508
02:25:42,950 --> 02:25:42,960
there are some things out there that are
 

8509
02:25:42,960 --> 02:25:44,630
there are some things out there that are
extremely difficult to explain like

8510
02:25:44,630 --> 02:25:44,640
extremely difficult to explain like
 

8511
02:25:44,640 --> 02:25:47,990
extremely difficult to explain like
literally ufos unidentified yeah i mean

8512
02:25:47,990 --> 02:25:48,000
literally ufos unidentified yeah i mean
 

8513
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:49,670
literally ufos unidentified yeah i mean
we just don't know what they are but to

8514
02:25:49,670 --> 02:25:49,680
we just don't know what they are but to
 

8515
02:25:49,680 --> 02:25:52,309
we just don't know what they are but to
go from the idea that there's things out

8516
02:25:52,309 --> 02:25:52,319
go from the idea that there's things out
 

8517
02:25:52,319 --> 02:25:55,030
go from the idea that there's things out
there that we don't understand to

8518
02:25:55,030 --> 02:25:55,040
there that we don't understand to
 

8519
02:25:55,040 --> 02:25:56,150
there that we don't understand to
this

8520

little creatures running around and um
 

8525
02:25:59,920 --> 02:26:01,750
little creatures running around and um
and these somehow exist

02:26:06,950 --> 02:26:06,960
agnostic about these things i think it's
 

8533
02:26:06,960 --> 02:26:08,950
agnostic about these things i think it's
possible but

8534
02:26:08,950 --> 02:26:08,960
possible but
 

8535
02:26:08,960 --> 02:26:10,710
possible but
all the evidence that i've been shown so

8536
02:26:10,710 --> 02:26:10,720
all the evidence that i've been shown so
 

8537
02:26:10,720 --> 02:26:12,950
all the evidence that i've been shown so
far was insufficient to come to any kind

8538
02:26:12,950 --> 02:26:12,960
far was insufficient to come to any kind

many of the stories that get told

8550
02:26:26,469 --> 02:26:26,479
many of the stories that get told
 

8551
02:26:26,479 --> 02:26:28,469
many of the stories that get told
well what about if it's not little

8552
02:26:28,469 --> 02:26:28,479
well what about if it's not little
 

8553
02:26:28,479 --> 02:26:30,550
well what about if it's not little
aliens with ray guns but something very

8554
02:26:30,550 --> 02:26:30,560
aliens with ray guns but something very
 

8555
02:26:30,560 --> 02:26:32,630
aliens with ray guns but something very
different very very difficult to detect

8556
02:26:32,630 --> 02:26:32,640
different very very difficult to detect
 

8557
02:26:32,640 --> 02:26:35,110
different very very difficult to detect
for us humans that's very human

8558
02:26:35,110 --> 02:26:35,120
for us humans that's very human
 

8559
02:26:35,120 --> 02:26:36,950
for us humans that's very human
at that point it's a it's a fascinating

8560
02:26:36,950 --> 02:26:36,960
at that point it's a it's a fascinating
 

8561
02:26:36,960 --> 02:26:39,110
at that point it's a it's a fascinating
idea and it's certainly possible but

8562
02:26:39,110 --> 02:26:39,120
idea and it's certainly possible but
 

8563
02:26:39,120 --> 02:26:41,750
idea and it's certainly possible but
show me the evidence

8564
02:26:41,750 --> 02:26:41,760
show me the evidence
 

8565
02:26:41,760 --> 02:26:44,309
show me the evidence
all right what about you gordon

8566
02:26:44,309 --> 02:26:44,319
all right what about you gordon
 

8567
02:26:44,319 --> 02:26:46,550
all right what about you gordon
do you do you uh look at the cosmos and

8568
02:26:46,550 --> 02:26:46,560
do you do you uh look at the cosmos and
 

8569
02:26:46,560 --> 02:26:49,910
do you do you uh look at the cosmos and
ponder the stars often i think it's fair

8570
02:26:49,910 --> 02:26:49,920
ponder the stars often i think it's fair

65 million light years away somehow
 

8583
02:27:01,920 --> 02:27:03,750
65 million light years away somehow
managed to look

8584
02:27:03,750 --> 02:27:03,760
managed to look
 

8585
02:27:03,760 --> 02:27:04,870
managed to look
at earth

8586
02:27:04,870 --> 02:27:04,880
at earth
 

8587
02:27:04,880 --> 02:27:06,389
at earth
they would theoretically see the

8588
02:27:06,389 --> 02:27:06,399
they would theoretically see the
 

8589
02:27:06,399 --> 02:27:08,309
they would theoretically see the
dinosaurs because they're 65 million

8590
02:27:08,309 --> 02:27:08,319
dinosaurs because they're 65 million
 

8591
02:27:08,319 --> 02:27:10,150
dinosaurs because they're 65 million
light years away so like imagine us

8592
02:27:10,150 --> 02:27:10,160
light years away so like imagine us
 

8593
02:27:10,160 --> 02:27:11,110
light years away so like imagine us
looking at

8594
02:27:11,110 --> 02:27:11,120
looking at
 

8595
02:27:11,120 --> 02:27:12,550
looking at
galaxies that are 100 million light

8596
02:27:12,550 --> 02:27:12,560
galaxies that are 100 million light
 

8597
02:27:12,560 --> 02:27:14,469
galaxies that are 100 million light
years away that's 100 million years ago

8598
02:27:14,469 --> 02:27:14,479
years away that's 100 million years ago
 

8599
02:27:14,479 --> 02:27:16,309
years away that's 100 million years ago
you have no idea what it looks like now

8600
02:27:16,309 --> 02:27:16,319
you have no idea what it looks like now
 

8601
02:27:16,319 --> 02:27:17,670
you have no idea what it looks like now
so that's what's super interesting to me

8602
02:27:17,670 --> 02:27:17,680
so that's what's super interesting to me
 

8603
02:27:17,680 --> 02:27:19,349
so that's what's super interesting to me
about it

8604
02:27:19,349 --> 02:27:19,359
about it
 

8605
02:27:19,359 --> 02:27:22,070
about it
yeah the the expanse is huge

8606
02:27:22,070 --> 02:27:22,080
yeah the the expanse is huge
 

8607
02:27:22,080 --> 02:27:24,150
yeah the the expanse is huge
and so much cool stuff could be going

8608
02:27:24,150 --> 02:27:24,160
and so much cool stuff could be going
 

8609
02:27:24,160 --> 02:27:25,990
and so much cool stuff could be going
out there

8610
02:27:25,990 --> 02:27:26,000
out there
 

8611
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:27,830
out there
the scary thing of course is if they

8612
02:27:27,830 --> 02:27:27,840
the scary thing of course is if they
 

8613
02:27:27,840 --> 02:27:31,510
the scary thing of course is if they
haven't visited us yet the

8614
02:27:31,510 --> 02:27:31,520
haven't visited us yet the
 

8615
02:27:31,520 --> 02:27:33,590
haven't visited us yet the
there has to be a good reason for it

8616
02:27:33,590 --> 02:27:33,600
there has to be a good reason for it
 

8617
02:27:33,600 --> 02:27:35,910
there has to be a good reason for it
and the the set of scary reasons of all

8618
02:27:35,910 --> 02:27:35,920
and the the set of scary reasons of all
 

8619
02:27:35,920 --> 02:27:38,070
and the the set of scary reasons of all
the fact that they maybe once you get

8620
02:27:38,070 --> 02:27:38,080
the fact that they maybe once you get
 

8621
02:27:38,080 --> 02:27:39,750
the fact that they maybe once you get
sufficiently advanced in your

8622
02:27:39,750 --> 02:27:39,760
sufficiently advanced in your
 

8623
02:27:39,760 --> 02:27:41,750
sufficiently advanced in your
development you destroy yourself

8624
02:27:41,750 --> 02:27:41,760
development you destroy yourself
 

8625
02:27:41,760 --> 02:27:43,270
development you destroy yourself
naturally as humans seem to be

8626
02:27:43,270 --> 02:27:43,280
naturally as humans seem to be
 

8627
02:27:43,280 --> 02:27:44,790
naturally as humans seem to be
approaching now

8628
02:27:44,790 --> 02:27:44,800
approaching now
 

8629
02:27:44,800 --> 02:27:46,309
approaching now
we more and more have the tools to

8630
02:27:46,309 --> 02:27:46,319
we more and more have the tools to
 

8631
02:27:46,319 --> 02:27:48,550
we more and more have the tools to
distort ourselves completely

8632
02:27:48,550 --> 02:27:48,560
distort ourselves completely
 

8633
02:27:48,560 --> 02:27:51,190
distort ourselves completely
in terms of our weapon systems

8634
02:27:51,190 --> 02:27:51,200
in terms of our weapon systems
 

8635
02:27:51,200 --> 02:27:52,950
in terms of our weapon systems
um and we're developing them more and

8636
02:27:52,950 --> 02:27:52,960
um and we're developing them more and
 

8637
02:27:52,960 --> 02:27:54,389
um and we're developing them more and
more and they're becoming better and

8638
02:27:54,389 --> 02:27:54,399
more and they're becoming better and
 

8639
02:27:54,399 --> 02:27:55,349
more and they're becoming better and
better

8640
02:27:55,349 --> 02:27:55,359
better
 

8641
02:27:55,359 --> 02:27:56,950
better
and we're starting to get angry and

8642
02:27:56,950 --> 02:27:56,960
and we're starting to get angry and
 

8643
02:27:56,960 --> 02:27:59,030
and we're starting to get angry and
angry on twitter and instagram with each

8644
02:27:59,030 --> 02:27:59,040
angry on twitter and instagram with each
 

8645
02:27:59,040 --> 02:28:00,710
angry on twitter and instagram with each
other

8646
02:28:00,710 --> 02:28:00,720
other
 

8647
02:28:00,720 --> 02:28:03,429
other
those are good points you're raising

8648
02:28:03,429 --> 02:28:03,439
those are good points you're raising
 

8649
02:28:03,439 --> 02:28:05,750
those are good points you're raising
history has taught us that

8650
02:28:05,750 --> 02:28:05,760
history has taught us that
 

8651
02:28:05,760 --> 02:28:07,830
history has taught us that
everything that lives one day will die

8652
02:28:07,830 --> 02:28:07,840
everything that lives one day will die
 

8653
02:28:07,840 --> 02:28:11,110
everything that lives one day will die
so we will we will perish one day yeah

8654
02:28:11,110 --> 02:28:11,120
so we will we will perish one day yeah
 

8655
02:28:11,120 --> 02:28:12,870
so we will we will perish one day yeah
there's also just the the sheer

8656
02:28:12,870 --> 02:28:12,880
there's also just the the sheer
 

8657
02:28:12,880 --> 02:28:15,190
there's also just the the sheer
difficulty of um

8658
02:28:15,190 --> 02:28:15,200
difficulty of um
 

8659
02:28:15,200 --> 02:28:16,630
difficulty of um
of

8660
02:28:16,630 --> 02:28:16,640
of

of travel through space like space is an
 

8663
02:28:19,520 --> 02:28:23,030
of travel through space like space is an
unimaginably inhospitable environment

8664
02:28:23,030 --> 02:28:23,040
unimaginably inhospitable environment
 

8665
02:28:23,040 --> 02:28:27,429
unimaginably inhospitable environment
and to the best of our knowledge

8666
02:28:27,429 --> 02:28:27,439

 

8667
02:28:27,439 --> 02:28:30,309

this even the theoretical speeds that we

8668
02:28:30,309 --> 02:28:30,319
this even the theoretical speeds that we
 

8669
02:28:30,319 --> 02:28:33,510
this even the theoretical speeds that we
can attain in space even if we could

8670
02:28:33,510 --> 02:28:33,520
can attain in space even if we could
 

8671
02:28:33,520 --> 02:28:34,870
can attain in space even if we could
travel at the speed of light we're not

8672
02:28:34,870 --> 02:28:34,880
travel at the speed of light we're not
 

8673
02:28:34,880 --> 02:28:37,590
travel at the speed of light we're not
even remotely close to that

8674
02:28:37,590 --> 02:28:37,600
even remotely close to that
 

8675
02:28:37,600 --> 02:28:39,590
even remotely close to that
still the distances that need to be

02:28:39,590 --> 02:28:39,600
still the distances that need to be
 

8677
02:28:39,600 --> 02:28:42,309
still the distances that need to be
traveled to get to even relatively close

solar systems are

8680
02:28:44,309 --> 02:28:44,319
solar systems are
 

8681
02:28:44,319 --> 02:28:47,750
solar systems are
very very long if you look at astronauts

02:28:47,760 --> 02:28:49,510
very very long if you look at astronauts
who have spent significant amounts of

who have spent significant amounts of
 

8685

of the mind that is john donahue maybe
 

8701
02:29:06,479 --> 02:29:08,389
of the mind that is john donahue maybe
we can transfer the mind

8702
02:29:08,389 --> 02:29:08,399
we can transfer the mind
 

8703
02:29:08,399 --> 02:29:11,830
we can transfer the mind
alone so the the the the bag the me the

that's possible but what do you think of
 

8713
02:29:19,600 --> 02:29:21,750
that's possible but what do you think of
concrete evidence you folks who like

the planet because historically in the
 

8733
02:29:43,200 --> 02:29:45,270
the planet because historically in the
past we know that we've been bombarded

past we know that we've been bombarded
 

8735
02:29:45,280 --> 02:29:48,230

their crazy things happen here it's very

8738
02:29:50,150 --> 02:29:50,160
their crazy things happen here it's very
 

8739
02:29:50,160 --> 02:29:51,910
their crazy things happen here it's very
unstable you know we

8740
02:29:51,910 --> 02:29:51,920
unstable you know we
 

8741
02:29:51,920 --> 02:29:53,429
unstable you know we
if you look at it to

8742
02:29:53,429 --> 02:29:53,439
if you look at it to
 

8743
02:29:53,439 --> 02:29:55,510
if you look at it to
through a lifetime of a human being it's

8744
02:29:55,510 --> 02:29:55,520
through a lifetime of a human being it's
 

8745
02:29:55,520 --> 02:29:58,070
through a lifetime of a human being it's
nothing but just look 12 000 years ago

8746
02:29:58,070 --> 02:29:58,080
nothing but just look 12 000 years ago
 

8747
02:29:58,080 --> 02:30:00,389
nothing but just look 12 000 years ago
what happened you know so there is

8748
02:30:00,389 --> 02:30:00,399
what happened you know so there is
 

8749
02:30:00,399 --> 02:30:02,790
what happened you know so there is
cataclysm that happen all the time it's

8750
02:30:02,790 --> 02:30:02,800
cataclysm that happen all the time it's
 

8751
02:30:02,800 --> 02:30:04,389
cataclysm that happen all the time it's
very unstable so

8752
02:30:04,389 --> 02:30:04,399
very unstable so
 

8753
02:30:04,399 --> 02:30:06,469
very unstable so
if we want to survive as a species i

8754
02:30:06,469 --> 02:30:06,479
if we want to survive as a species i
 

8755
02:30:06,479 --> 02:30:09,110
if we want to survive as a species i
think it's it's we need to get out to be

8756
02:30:09,110 --> 02:30:09,120
think it's it's we need to get out to be
 

8757
02:30:09,120 --> 02:30:10,630
think it's it's we need to get out to be
able to get out and

8758
02:30:10,630 --> 02:30:10,640
able to get out and
 

8759
02:30:10,640 --> 02:30:12,070
able to get out and
spread our seed

8760
02:30:12,070 --> 02:30:12,080
spread our seed
 

8761
02:30:12,080 --> 02:30:14,070
spread our seed
so these are the early steps on on a

8762
02:30:14,070 --> 02:30:14,080
so these are the early steps on on a
 

8763
02:30:14,080 --> 02:30:15,429
so these are the early steps on on a
really long journey but is there

8764
02:30:15,429 --> 02:30:15,439
really long journey but is there
 

8765
02:30:15,439 --> 02:30:18,230
really long journey but is there
something about like

8766
02:30:18,230 --> 02:30:18,240
something about like
 

8767
02:30:18,240 --> 02:30:20,230
something about like
you know we don't get that exploration

8768
02:30:20,230 --> 02:30:20,240
you know we don't get that exploration
 

8769
02:30:20,240 --> 02:30:22,469
you know we don't get that exploration
from most modern society you know the

8770
02:30:22,469 --> 02:30:22,479
from most modern society you know the
 

8771
02:30:22,479 --> 02:30:23,670
from most modern society you know the
kind of exploring that people did

8772
02:30:23,670 --> 02:30:23,680
kind of exploring that people did
 

8773
02:30:23,680 --> 02:30:26,230
kind of exploring that people did
throughout the centuries of uh you know

8774
02:30:26,230 --> 02:30:26,240
throughout the centuries of uh you know
 

8775
02:30:26,240 --> 02:30:27,510
throughout the centuries of uh you know
coming to the

8776
02:30:27,510 --> 02:30:27,520
coming to the
 

8777
02:30:27,520 --> 02:30:30,230
coming to the
north america just throughout we were

8778
02:30:30,230 --> 02:30:30,240
north america just throughout we were
 

8779
02:30:30,240 --> 02:30:32,710
north america just throughout we were
shrouded in physical uncertainty of

8780
02:30:32,710 --> 02:30:32,720
shrouded in physical uncertainty of
 

8781
02:30:32,720 --> 02:30:34,230
shrouded in physical uncertainty of
what's out there

8782
02:30:34,230 --> 02:30:34,240
what's out there
 

8783
02:30:34,240 --> 02:30:35,910
what's out there
and now we get to do the same kind of

8784
02:30:35,910 --> 02:30:35,920
and now we get to do the same kind of
 

8785
02:30:35,920 --> 02:30:37,510
and now we get to do the same kind of
exploration with mars

8786
02:30:37,510 --> 02:30:37,520
exploration with mars
 

8787
02:30:37,520 --> 02:30:40,150
exploration with mars
is there so i mean is there any aspect

8788
02:30:40,150 --> 02:30:40,160
is there so i mean is there any aspect
 

8789
02:30:40,160 --> 02:30:41,750
is there so i mean is there any aspect
of you that wants to

8790
02:30:41,750 --> 02:30:41,760
of you that wants to
 

8791
02:30:41,760 --> 02:30:43,670
of you that wants to
travel out to space that wants to travel

travel out to space that wants to travel
 

8793
02:30:43,680 --> 02:30:44,790
travel out to space that wants to travel
to mars

to mars
 

8795
02:30:44,800 --> 02:30:45,670
to mars
there

8796
02:30:45,670 --> 02:30:45,680
there
 

8797
02:30:45,680 --> 02:30:47,510
there
you know the goal is to allow civilians

8798
02:30:47,510 --> 02:30:47,520
you know the goal is to allow civilians

to travel
 

8801
02:30:49,200 --> 02:30:51,030
to travel
perhaps in our lifetime

perhaps in our lifetime

02:30:51,040 --> 02:30:53,030
perhaps in our lifetime
meaning affordably you can do so now

are
 

8811
02:30:57,280 --> 02:30:58,630

like to travel into space
 

8815
02:31:00,720 --> 02:31:02,550
like to travel into space
i don't know if i would like to travel

8816
02:31:02,550 --> 02:31:02,560
i don't know if i would like to travel
 

8817
02:31:02,560 --> 02:31:04,309
i don't know if i would like to travel
all the way to mars because of the risks

8818
02:31:04,309 --> 02:31:04,319
all the way to mars because of the risks
 

8819
02:31:04,319 --> 02:31:06,150
all the way to mars because of the risks
involved

8820

involved
 

8821
02:31:06,160 --> 02:31:07,750

the future maybe our
 

8845
02:31:25,520 --> 02:31:27,590
the future maybe our
the children of our children will will

8846
02:31:27,590 --> 02:31:27,600
the children of our children will will
 

8847
02:31:27,600 --> 02:31:30,870
the children of our children will will
be able to to experience that to go to

8848
02:31:30,870 --> 02:31:30,880
be able to to experience that to go to
 

8849
02:31:30,880 --> 02:31:32,469
be able to to experience that to go to
well the the weekend

8850
02:31:32,469 --> 02:31:32,479
well the the weekend
 

8851
02:31:32,479 --> 02:31:33,990
well the the weekend
on mars

8852
02:31:33,990 --> 02:31:34,000
on mars
 

8853
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:36,309
on mars
uh well the whole design of the starship

8854
02:31:36,309 --> 02:31:36,319
uh well the whole design of the starship
 

8855
02:31:36,319 --> 02:31:38,230
uh well the whole design of the starship
that the spacex is working on is

8856
02:31:38,230 --> 02:31:38,240
that the spacex is working on is
 

8857
02:31:38,240 --> 02:31:40,230
that the spacex is working on is
supposed to come back

8858
02:31:40,230 --> 02:31:40,240
supposed to come back
 

8859
02:31:40,240 --> 02:31:42,070
supposed to come back
it's supposed to be reusable so it's not

8860
02:31:42,070 --> 02:31:42,080
it's supposed to be reusable so it's not
 

8861
02:31:42,080 --> 02:31:44,070
it's supposed to be reusable so it's not
it's not a one-way ticket that's the

8862
02:31:44,070 --> 02:31:44,080
it's not a one-way ticket that's the
 

8863
02:31:44,080 --> 02:31:46,150
it's not a one-way ticket that's the
whole point just it's always going back

8864
02:31:46,150 --> 02:31:46,160
whole point just it's always going back
 

8865
02:31:46,160 --> 02:31:47,830
whole point just it's always going back
and forth back and forth what's the time

8866
02:31:47,830 --> 02:31:47,840
and forth back and forth what's the time
 

8867
02:31:47,840 --> 02:31:51,270
and forth back and forth what's the time
frame between two planets like to travel

8868
02:31:51,270 --> 02:31:51,280
frame between two planets like to travel
 

8869
02:31:51,280 --> 02:31:53,670
frame between two planets like to travel
from i think the current thing you'd be

8870
02:31:53,670 --> 02:31:53,680
from i think the current thing you'd be
 

8871
02:31:53,680 --> 02:31:55,429
from i think the current thing you'd be
stuck on mars for two years

8872
02:31:55,429 --> 02:31:55,439
stuck on mars for two years
 

8873
02:31:55,439 --> 02:31:56,630
stuck on mars for two years
but how long does it take to get from

8874
02:31:56,630 --> 02:31:56,640
but how long does it take to get from
 

8875
02:31:56,640 --> 02:31:58,710
but how long does it take to get from
earth to mars oh it's pretty

8876
02:31:58,710 --> 02:31:58,720
earth to mars oh it's pretty
 

8877
02:31:58,720 --> 02:32:00,070
earth to mars oh it's pretty
i'm not exactly sure but it's pretty

8878
02:32:00,070 --> 02:32:00,080
i'm not exactly sure but it's pretty
 

8879
02:32:00,080 --> 02:32:01,270
i'm not exactly sure but it's pretty
quick

8880
02:32:01,270 --> 02:32:01,280
quick
 

8881
02:32:01,280 --> 02:32:03,349
quick
that's pretty quick like i don't know on

8882
02:32:03,349 --> 02:32:03,359
that's pretty quick like i don't know on
 

8883
02:32:03,359 --> 02:32:05,590
that's pretty quick like i don't know on
the scale of months not scale of years

8884
02:32:05,590 --> 02:32:05,600
the scale of months not scale of years
 

8885
02:32:05,600 --> 02:32:07,349
the scale of months not scale of years
you might not be healthy when you come

8886
02:32:07,349 --> 02:32:07,359
you might not be healthy when you come
 

8887
02:32:07,359 --> 02:32:08,950
you might not be healthy when you come
back you know all the astronauts they

8888
02:32:08,950 --> 02:32:08,960
back you know all the astronauts they
 

8889
02:32:08,960 --> 02:32:11,110
back you know all the astronauts they
experience health issues you know they

8890
02:32:11,110 --> 02:32:11,120
experience health issues you know they
 

8891
02:32:11,120 --> 02:32:13,270
experience health issues you know they
lose a lot of muscle mass bone density

8892
02:32:13,270 --> 02:32:13,280
lose a lot of muscle mass bone density
 

8893
02:32:13,280 --> 02:32:14,070
lose a lot of muscle mass bone density
so

8894
02:32:14,070 --> 02:32:14,080
so
 

8895
02:32:14,080 --> 02:32:15,750
so
yeah i don't think the technology is

8896
02:32:15,750 --> 02:32:15,760
yeah i don't think the technology is
 

8897
02:32:15,760 --> 02:32:17,510
yeah i don't think the technology is
good right now i mean

8898
02:32:17,510 --> 02:32:17,520
good right now i mean
 

8899
02:32:17,520 --> 02:32:19,429
good right now i mean
let's say that if it is i would love to

8900
02:32:19,429 --> 02:32:19,439
let's say that if it is i would love to
 

8901
02:32:19,439 --> 02:32:22,550
let's say that if it is i would love to
be doing it for a weekend if it's safe i

8902
02:32:22,550 --> 02:32:22,560
be doing it for a weekend if it's safe i
 

8903
02:32:22,560 --> 02:32:24,630
be doing it for a weekend if it's safe i
will

8904
02:32:24,630 --> 02:32:24,640
will
 

8905
02:32:24,640 --> 02:32:26,790
will
or a professional fighter who sacrificed

8906
02:32:26,790 --> 02:32:26,800
or a professional fighter who sacrificed
 

8907
02:32:26,800 --> 02:32:29,110
or a professional fighter who sacrificed
his body for something so there's some

8908
02:32:29,110 --> 02:32:29,120
his body for something so there's some
 

8909
02:32:29,120 --> 02:32:31,670
his body for something so there's some
sacrifice we do in life right i don't

8910
02:32:31,670 --> 02:32:31,680
sacrifice we do in life right i don't
 

8911
02:32:31,680 --> 02:32:33,110
sacrifice we do in life right i don't
want to be there first i wouldn't want

8912
02:32:33,110 --> 02:32:33,120
want to be there first i wouldn't want
 

8913
02:32:33,120 --> 02:32:35,110
want to be there first i wouldn't want
to i leave the other one but when i know

8914
02:32:35,110 --> 02:32:35,120
to i leave the other one but when i know
 

8915
02:32:35,120 --> 02:32:36,790
to i leave the other one but when i know
it's it's safe

8916
02:32:36,790 --> 02:32:36,800
it's it's safe
 

8917
02:32:36,800 --> 02:32:38,469
it's it's safe
okay count me in so one of the things

8918
02:32:38,469 --> 02:32:38,479
okay count me in so one of the things
 

8919
02:32:38,479 --> 02:32:39,830
okay count me in so one of the things
that people say and this is something i

8920
02:32:39,830 --> 02:32:39,840
that people say and this is something i
 

8921
02:32:39,840 --> 02:32:41,190
that people say and this is something i
wonder about is

8922
02:32:41,190 --> 02:32:41,200
wonder about is
 

8923
02:32:41,200 --> 02:32:42,870
wonder about is
it's like having children or something

8924
02:32:42,870 --> 02:32:42,880
it's like having children or something
 

8925
02:32:42,880 --> 02:32:45,190
it's like having children or something
once you see once you're out in space

8926
02:32:45,190 --> 02:32:45,200
once you see once you're out in space
 

8927
02:32:45,200 --> 02:32:47,030
once you see once you're out in space
and you look out and you see earth you

8928
02:32:47,030 --> 02:32:47,040
and you look out and you see earth you
 

8929
02:32:47,040 --> 02:32:48,790
and you look out and you see earth you
look back at earth that's an experience

8930
02:32:48,790 --> 02:32:48,800
look back at earth that's an experience
 

8931
02:32:48,800 --> 02:32:50,950
look back at earth that's an experience
it's unlike anything else like you can't

8932
02:32:50,950 --> 02:32:50,960
it's unlike anything else like you can't
 

8933
02:32:50,960 --> 02:32:52,630
it's unlike anything else like you can't
replicate it here

8934
02:32:52,630 --> 02:32:52,640
replicate it here
 

8935
02:32:52,640 --> 02:32:55,510
replicate it here
um is is to look back at that like blue

8936
02:32:55,510 --> 02:32:55,520
um is is to look back at that like blue
 

8937
02:32:55,520 --> 02:32:56,790
um is is to look back at that like blue
dot

8938
02:32:56,790 --> 02:32:56,800
dot
 

8939
02:32:56,800 --> 02:33:00,790
dot
and that's nerve-wracking

8940
02:33:00,790 --> 02:33:00,800

 

8941
02:33:00,800 --> 02:33:02,309

you see like earth disappear into the

8942
02:33:02,309 --> 02:33:02,319
you see like earth disappear into the
 

8943
02:33:02,319 --> 02:33:03,270
you see like earth disappear into the
distance

8944
02:33:03,270 --> 02:33:03,280
distance
 

8945
02:33:03,280 --> 02:33:05,990
distance
yeah yeah disappear into the distance

8946
02:33:05,990 --> 02:33:06,000
yeah yeah disappear into the distance
 

8947
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:07,429
yeah yeah disappear into the distance
and then you get this actually stand on

8948
02:33:07,429 --> 02:33:07,439
and then you get this actually stand on
 

8949
02:33:07,439 --> 02:33:08,630
and then you get this actually stand on
mars and see

8950
02:33:08,630 --> 02:33:08,640
mars and see
 

8951
02:33:08,640 --> 02:33:10,389
mars and see
and just to look you're standing on the

8952
02:33:10,389 --> 02:33:10,399
and just to look you're standing on the
 

8953
02:33:10,399 --> 02:33:12,230
and just to look you're standing on the
ground and you're looking out

8954
02:33:12,230 --> 02:33:12,240
ground and you're looking out
 

8955
02:33:12,240 --> 02:33:13,750
ground and you're looking out
and you see the planet from which you

8956
02:33:13,750 --> 02:33:13,760
and you see the planet from which you
 

8957
02:33:13,760 --> 02:33:14,870
and you see the planet from which you
came and

8958
02:33:14,870 --> 02:33:14,880
came and
 

8959
02:33:14,880 --> 02:33:16,710
came and
where you might not be coming back but

8960
02:33:16,710 --> 02:33:16,720
where you might not be coming back but
 

8961
02:33:16,720 --> 02:33:18,150
where you might not be coming back but
there's a challenge to the whole thing

8962
02:33:18,150 --> 02:33:18,160
there's a challenge to the whole thing
 

8963
02:33:18,160 --> 02:33:20,870
there's a challenge to the whole thing
whereas the risk is tremendous

8964
02:33:20,870 --> 02:33:20,880
whereas the risk is tremendous
 

8965
02:33:20,880 --> 02:33:21,670
whereas the risk is tremendous
and

8966
02:33:21,670 --> 02:33:21,680
and
 

8967
02:33:21,680 --> 02:33:23,510
and
i don't know i find that risk really

8968
02:33:23,510 --> 02:33:23,520
i don't know i find that risk really
 

8969
02:33:23,520 --> 02:33:25,110
i don't know i find that risk really
compelling for some reason but that

8970
02:33:25,110 --> 02:33:25,120
compelling for some reason but that
 

8971
02:33:25,120 --> 02:33:27,270
compelling for some reason but that
could be just the exploration

8972
02:33:27,270 --> 02:33:27,280
could be just the exploration
 

8973
02:33:27,280 --> 02:33:29,030
could be just the exploration
i guess that's a genetic thing too how

8974
02:33:29,030 --> 02:33:29,040
i guess that's a genetic thing too how
 

8975
02:33:29,040 --> 02:33:31,670
i guess that's a genetic thing too how
much do you want to explore

8976
02:33:31,670 --> 02:33:31,680
much do you want to explore
 

8977
02:33:31,680 --> 02:33:33,429
much do you want to explore
there's a sense though in which even in

8978
02:33:33,429 --> 02:33:33,439
there's a sense though in which even in
 

8979
02:33:33,439 --> 02:33:35,270
there's a sense though in which even in
the best case scenario where they did

8980
02:33:35,270 --> 02:33:35,280
the best case scenario where they did
 

8981
02:33:35,280 --> 02:33:37,830
the best case scenario where they did
get the technology to whisk you to mars

8982
02:33:37,830 --> 02:33:37,840
get the technology to whisk you to mars
 

8983
02:33:37,840 --> 02:33:38,630
get the technology to whisk you to mars
and

8984
02:33:38,630 --> 02:33:38,640
and
 

8985
02:33:38,640 --> 02:33:41,349
and
in a fairly short period of time

8986
02:33:41,349 --> 02:33:41,359
in a fairly short period of time
 

8987
02:33:41,359 --> 02:33:44,150
in a fairly short period of time
it's kind of an inauthentic sense of

8988
02:33:44,150 --> 02:33:44,160
it's kind of an inauthentic sense of
 

8989
02:33:44,160 --> 02:33:45,990
it's kind of an inauthentic sense of
exploration because

8990
02:33:45,990 --> 02:33:46,000
exploration because
 

8991
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:49,030
exploration because
your participation in it is

8992
02:33:49,030 --> 02:33:49,040
your participation in it is
 

8993
02:33:49,040 --> 02:33:51,030
your participation in it is
no more exciting than

8994
02:33:51,030 --> 02:33:51,040
no more exciting than
 

8995
02:33:51,040 --> 02:33:53,670
no more exciting than
your participation in an airline flight

8996
02:33:53,670 --> 02:33:53,680
your participation in an airline flight
 

8997
02:33:53,680 --> 02:33:56,150
your participation in an airline flight
to a foreign country you basically

8998
02:33:56,150 --> 02:33:56,160
to a foreign country you basically
 

8999
02:33:56,160 --> 02:33:57,349
to a foreign country you basically
you didn't have anything to do with the

9000
02:33:57,349 --> 02:33:57,359
you didn't have anything to do with the
 

9001
02:33:57,359 --> 02:33:59,670
you didn't have anything to do with the
creation of the of the vessel you're not

creation of the of the vessel you're not
in command of the vessel you're not in

9004
02:34:02,309 --> 02:34:02,319
in command of the vessel you're not in
 

9005
02:34:02,319 --> 02:34:04,150
in command of the vessel you're not in
any way shape or form important to the

any way shape or form important to the
 

9007
02:34:04,160 --> 02:34:05,990
any way shape or form important to the
mission you're just the person sitting

9008
02:34:05,990 --> 02:34:06,000
mission you're just the person sitting
 

9009
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:08,070
mission you're just the person sitting
in a passenger seat and you get off in a

9010
02:34:08,070 --> 02:34:08,080
in a passenger seat and you get off in a
 

9011
02:34:08,080 --> 02:34:09,510
in a passenger seat and you get off in a
destination the same way you would if

9012
02:34:09,510 --> 02:34:09,520
destination the same way you would if
 

9013
02:34:09,520 --> 02:34:11,270
destination the same way you would if
you flew to singapore or london or some

9014
02:34:11,270 --> 02:34:11,280
you flew to singapore or london or some
 

9015
02:34:11,280 --> 02:34:14,230
you flew to singapore or london or some
place like that well there's a hierarchy

9016
02:34:14,230 --> 02:34:14,240
place like that well there's a hierarchy
 

9017
02:34:14,240 --> 02:34:15,830
place like that well there's a hierarchy
of there's a leadership and then there's

9018
02:34:15,830 --> 02:34:15,840
of there's a leadership and then there's
 

9019
02:34:15,840 --> 02:34:17,030
of there's a leadership and then there's
a bunch of people and they all have

9020
02:34:17,030 --> 02:34:17,040
a bunch of people and they all have
 

9021
02:34:17,040 --> 02:34:19,030
a bunch of people and they all have
roles you don't get to go to mars

9022
02:34:19,030 --> 02:34:19,040
roles you don't get to go to mars
 

9023
02:34:19,040 --> 02:34:21,510
roles you don't get to go to mars
without having a skill set but

9024
02:34:21,510 --> 02:34:21,520
without having a skill set but
 

9025
02:34:21,520 --> 02:34:23,349
without having a skill set but
you made it sound like space tourism

9026
02:34:23,349 --> 02:34:23,359
you made it sound like space tourism
 

9027
02:34:23,359 --> 02:34:25,190
you made it sound like space tourism
where you just pay a ticket i don't i

9028
02:34:25,190 --> 02:34:25,200
where you just pay a ticket i don't i
 

9029
02:34:25,200 --> 02:34:26,630
where you just pay a ticket i don't i
think it's a long time before you have

9030
02:34:26,630 --> 02:34:26,640
think it's a long time before you have
 

9031
02:34:26,640 --> 02:34:28,950
think it's a long time before you have
space tourism to mars where you have

9032
02:34:28,950 --> 02:34:28,960
space tourism to mars where you have
 

9033
02:34:28,960 --> 02:34:30,790
space tourism to mars where you have
nothing to contribute

9034
02:34:30,790 --> 02:34:30,800
nothing to contribute
 

9035
02:34:30,800 --> 02:34:32,309
nothing to contribute
okay like you will have to what do you

9036
02:34:32,309 --> 02:34:32,319
okay like you will have to what do you
 

9037
02:34:32,319 --> 02:34:33,670
okay like you will have to what do you
do you go through like a training

9038
02:34:33,670 --> 02:34:33,680
do you go through like a training
 

9039
02:34:33,680 --> 02:34:35,349
do you go through like a training
program you go training program and then

9040
02:34:35,349 --> 02:34:35,359
program you go training program and then
 

9041
02:34:35,359 --> 02:34:36,870
program you go training program and then
there's uh there's technical things

9042
02:34:36,870 --> 02:34:36,880
there's uh there's technical things
 

9043
02:34:36,880 --> 02:34:38,389
there's uh there's technical things
you'll be contributing so there they

9044
02:34:38,389 --> 02:34:38,399
you'll be contributing so there they
 

9045
02:34:38,399 --> 02:34:39,349
you'll be contributing so there they
would bring

9046
02:34:39,349 --> 02:34:39,359
would bring
 

9047
02:34:39,359 --> 02:34:40,469
would bring
people

9048
02:34:40,469 --> 02:34:40,479
people
 

9049
02:34:40,479 --> 02:34:42,230
people
you know in terms of agriculture i don't

9050
02:34:42,230 --> 02:34:42,240
you know in terms of agriculture i don't
 

9051
02:34:42,240 --> 02:34:43,910
you know in terms of agriculture i don't
know okay so this is this is better this

9052
02:34:43,910 --> 02:34:43,920
know okay so this is this is better this
 

9053
02:34:43,920 --> 02:34:45,510
know okay so this is this is better this
sounds like they're actual they're more

9054
02:34:45,510 --> 02:34:45,520
sounds like they're actual they're more
 

9055
02:34:45,520 --> 02:34:47,510
sounds like they're actual they're more
like explorers like if you you talked

9056
02:34:47,510 --> 02:34:47,520
like explorers like if you you talked
 

9057
02:34:47,520 --> 02:34:50,150
like explorers like if you you talked
before about explorers and and human

9058
02:34:50,150 --> 02:34:50,160
before about explorers and and human
 

9059
02:34:50,160 --> 02:34:52,309
before about explorers and and human
history where magellan sets off on his

9060
02:34:52,309 --> 02:34:52,319
history where magellan sets off on his
 

9061
02:34:52,319 --> 02:34:53,910
history where magellan sets off on his
boat and every person on the boat had a

9062
02:34:53,910 --> 02:34:53,920
boat and every person on the boat had a
 

9063
02:34:53,920 --> 02:34:55,750
boat and every person on the boat had a
specific function they were they were

9064
02:34:55,750 --> 02:34:55,760
specific function they were they were
 

9065
02:34:55,760 --> 02:34:56,950
specific function they were they were
all

9066
02:34:56,950 --> 02:34:56,960
all
 

9067
02:34:56,960 --> 02:34:58,710
all
into the mission in a very authentic

9068
02:34:58,710 --> 02:34:58,720
into the mission in a very authentic
 

9069
02:34:58,720 --> 02:35:00,309
into the mission in a very authentic
fashion if they weren't on the boat the

9070
02:35:00,309 --> 02:35:00,319
fashion if they weren't on the boat the
 

9071
02:35:00,319 --> 02:35:01,750
fashion if they weren't on the boat the
performance of the crew would somehow

9072
02:35:01,750 --> 02:35:01,760
performance of the crew would somehow
 

9073
02:35:01,760 --> 02:35:04,389
performance of the crew would somehow
suffer so this sounds much better and

9074
02:35:04,389 --> 02:35:04,399
suffer so this sounds much better and
 

9075
02:35:04,399 --> 02:35:06,710
suffer so this sounds much better and
with just with like with magellan i

9076
02:35:06,710 --> 02:35:06,720
with just with like with magellan i
 

9077
02:35:06,720 --> 02:35:08,870
with just with like with magellan i
think most of the crew died

9078
02:35:08,870 --> 02:35:08,880
think most of the crew died
 

9079
02:35:08,880 --> 02:35:12,790
think most of the crew died
a significant number did yeah

9080
02:35:12,790 --> 02:35:12,800
a significant number did yeah
 

9081
02:35:12,800 --> 02:35:16,150
a significant number did yeah
and from uh yeah from bacteria i mean

9082
02:35:16,150 --> 02:35:16,160
and from uh yeah from bacteria i mean
 

9083
02:35:16,160 --> 02:35:18,070
and from uh yeah from bacteria i mean
from things that are unexpected and so

9084
02:35:18,070 --> 02:35:18,080
from things that are unexpected and so
 

9085
02:35:18,080 --> 02:35:20,710
from things that are unexpected and so
on and if we discover life on mars i

9086
02:35:20,710 --> 02:35:20,720
on and if we discover life on mars i
 

9087
02:35:20,720 --> 02:35:22,710
on and if we discover life on mars i
mean who knows what that entails because

9088
02:35:22,710 --> 02:35:22,720
mean who knows what that entails because
 

9089
02:35:22,720 --> 02:35:25,510
mean who knows what that entails because
that's like a manned mission to mars

9090
02:35:25,510 --> 02:35:25,520
that's like a manned mission to mars
 

9091
02:35:25,520 --> 02:35:27,349
that's like a manned mission to mars
would likely be very driven by the

9092
02:35:27,349 --> 02:35:27,359
would likely be very driven by the
 

9093
02:35:27,359 --> 02:35:30,469
would likely be very driven by the
research to do all the kind of

9094
02:35:30,469 --> 02:35:30,479
research to do all the kind of
 

9095
02:35:30,479 --> 02:35:32,950
research to do all the kind of
exploration required to define life

9096
02:35:32,950 --> 02:35:32,960
exploration required to define life
 

9097
02:35:32,960 --> 02:35:35,110
exploration required to define life
now from

9098
02:35:35,110 --> 02:35:35,120
now from
 

9099
02:35:35,120 --> 02:35:37,349
now from
mr musk's

9100
02:35:37,349 --> 02:35:37,359
mr musk's
 

9101
02:35:37,359 --> 02:35:39,429
mr musk's
point of view as a developer presumably

9102
02:35:39,429 --> 02:35:39,439
point of view as a developer presumably
 

9103
02:35:39,439 --> 02:35:40,870
point of view as a developer presumably
there has to be some kind of financial

9104
02:35:40,870 --> 02:35:40,880
there has to be some kind of financial
 

9105
02:35:40,880 --> 02:35:42,469
there has to be some kind of financial
incentive here too

9106
02:35:42,469 --> 02:35:42,479
incentive here too
 

9107
02:35:42,479 --> 02:35:43,670
incentive here too
is there

9108
02:35:43,670 --> 02:35:43,680
is there
 

9109
02:35:43,680 --> 02:35:46,389
is there
some kind of financial benefit to mars

9110
02:35:46,389 --> 02:35:46,399
some kind of financial benefit to mars
 

9111
02:35:46,399 --> 02:35:48,790
some kind of financial benefit to mars
missions is

9112
02:35:48,790 --> 02:35:48,800
missions is
 

9113
02:35:48,800 --> 02:35:50,389
missions is
presumably

9114
02:35:50,389 --> 02:35:50,399
presumably
 

9115
02:35:50,399 --> 02:35:51,270
presumably
um

9116
02:35:51,270 --> 02:35:51,280
um
 

9117
02:35:51,280 --> 02:35:52,870
um
there wouldn't be that many people on

9118
02:35:52,870 --> 02:35:52,880
there wouldn't be that many people on
 

9119
02:35:52,880 --> 02:35:54,710
there wouldn't be that many people on
earth that could afford a ticket to pay

9120
02:35:54,710 --> 02:35:54,720
earth that could afford a ticket to pay
 

9121
02:35:54,720 --> 02:35:56,469
earth that could afford a ticket to pay
for the kind of research and development

9122
02:35:56,469 --> 02:35:56,479
for the kind of research and development
 

9123
02:35:56,479 --> 02:35:58,309
for the kind of research and development
that would require this is there some

9124
02:35:58,309 --> 02:35:58,319
that would require this is there some
 

9125
02:35:58,319 --> 02:36:00,630
that would require this is there some
kind of mining on mars of minerals that

9126
02:36:00,630 --> 02:36:00,640
kind of mining on mars of minerals that
 

9127
02:36:00,640 --> 02:36:02,309
kind of mining on mars of minerals that
would be useless i think there's a lot

9128
02:36:02,309 --> 02:36:02,319
would be useless i think there's a lot
 

9129
02:36:02,319 --> 02:36:04,230
would be useless i think there's a lot
of answers to this but the only honest

9130
02:36:04,230 --> 02:36:04,240
of answers to this but the only honest
 

9131
02:36:04,240 --> 02:36:05,990
of answers to this but the only honest
answer is the one that looks back into

9132
02:36:05,990 --> 02:36:06,000
answer is the one that looks back into
 

9133
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:07,510
answer is the one that looks back into
human history where we did a lot of

9134
02:36:07,510 --> 02:36:07,520
human history where we did a lot of
 

9135
02:36:07,520 --> 02:36:09,270
human history where we did a lot of
things just because we

9136
02:36:09,270 --> 02:36:09,280
things just because we
 

9137
02:36:09,280 --> 02:36:10,230
things just because we
could

9138
02:36:10,230 --> 02:36:10,240
could
 

9139
02:36:10,240 --> 02:36:12,230
could
a lot of hard things just because we

9140
02:36:12,230 --> 02:36:12,240
a lot of hard things just because we
 

9141
02:36:12,240 --> 02:36:13,990
a lot of hard things just because we
could and that led to a lot of

9142
02:36:13,990 --> 02:36:14,000
could and that led to a lot of
 

9143
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:15,910
could and that led to a lot of
innovation that ultimately made our life

9144
02:36:15,910 --> 02:36:15,920
innovation that ultimately made our life
 

9145
02:36:15,920 --> 02:36:18,469
innovation that ultimately made our life
better so this is more this is why you

9146
02:36:18,469 --> 02:36:18,479
better so this is more this is why you
 

9147
02:36:18,479 --> 02:36:19,830
better so this is more this is why you
have nasa this is why you have

9148
02:36:19,830 --> 02:36:19,840
have nasa this is why you have
 

9149
02:36:19,840 --> 02:36:21,670
have nasa this is why you have
government organizations like what's the

9150
02:36:21,670 --> 02:36:21,680
government organizations like what's the
 

9151
02:36:21,680 --> 02:36:24,150
government organizations like what's the
purpose of nasa nasa would answer that

9152
02:36:24,150 --> 02:36:24,160
purpose of nasa nasa would answer that
 

9153
02:36:24,160 --> 02:36:26,389
purpose of nasa nasa would answer that
by saying okay well we're helping

9154
02:36:26,389 --> 02:36:26,399
by saying okay well we're helping
 

9155
02:36:26,399 --> 02:36:28,710
by saying okay well we're helping
launch satellites up there all they'll

9156
02:36:28,710 --> 02:36:28,720
launch satellites up there all they'll
 

9157
02:36:28,720 --> 02:36:30,630
launch satellites up there all they'll
have a bunch of answers but the reality

9158
02:36:30,630 --> 02:36:30,640
have a bunch of answers but the reality
 

9159
02:36:30,640 --> 02:36:33,190
have a bunch of answers but the reality
is the programs

9160
02:36:33,190 --> 02:36:33,200
is the programs
 

9161

were
 

9163
02:36:34,160 --> 02:36:36,790
were
funded in large part by our desire to

9164
02:36:36,790 --> 02:36:36,800
funded in large part by our desire to
 

9165
02:36:36,800 --> 02:36:38,630
funded in large part by our desire to
explore the unknown

9166
02:36:38,630 --> 02:36:38,640
explore the unknown
 

9167
02:36:38,640 --> 02:36:40,790
explore the unknown
and um there's some aspect to which we

9168
02:36:40,790 --> 02:36:40,800
and um there's some aspect to which we
 

9169
02:36:40,800 --> 02:36:42,710
and um there's some aspect to which we
have to all invest into that because

9170
02:36:42,710 --> 02:36:42,720
have to all invest into that because
 

9171
02:36:42,720 --> 02:36:44,630
have to all invest into that because
historically speaking

9172
02:36:44,630 --> 02:36:44,640
historically speaking
 

9173
02:36:44,640 --> 02:36:46,469
historically speaking
that has produced a lot of cool things

unexpected like uh but nasa is funded by

9178
02:36:51,030 --> 02:36:51,040
unexpected like uh but nasa is funded by
 

9179
02:36:51,040 --> 02:36:54,630
unexpected like uh but nasa is funded by
public funding the taxpayer uh how is mr

most of the funding was the spacex is
 

9185
02:37:00,240 --> 02:37:01,590
most of the funding was the spacex is
nasa giving

9186

who can who can get our satellites we

9192
02:37:08,790 --> 02:37:08,800
who can who can get our satellites we
 

9193
02:37:08,800 --> 02:37:10,309

um
 

9197
02:37:11,600 --> 02:37:14,230
um
you know was for the space station to uh

9198
02:37:14,230 --> 02:37:14,240
you know was for the space station to uh
 

9199
02:37:14,240 --> 02:37:16,309
you know was for the space station to uh
resupply the space station or we need to

9200
02:37:16,309 --> 02:37:16,319
resupply the space station or we need to
 

9201
02:37:16,319 --> 02:37:18,230
resupply the space station or we need to
launch satellites up who's going to

carry those quote-unquote payloads they
 

9205
02:37:20,319 --> 02:37:22,070
carry those quote-unquote payloads they
just need so nasa is paying whoever the

9206
02:37:22,070 --> 02:37:22,080
just need so nasa is paying whoever the
 

9207
02:37:22,080 --> 02:37:23,429
just need so nasa is paying whoever the
heck wants to

uh get
kilograms of thing up into space

02:37:28,630 --> 02:37:28,640
kilograms of thing up into space
 

9213
02:37:28,640 --> 02:37:31,110
kilograms of thing up into space
why did this is nasa's specialty why did

9214
02:37:31,110 --> 02:37:31,120
why did this is nasa's specialty why did
 

9215
02:37:31,120 --> 02:37:33,110
why did this is nasa's specialty why did
they just give up on that well they why

9216
02:37:33,110 --> 02:37:33,120
they just give up on that well they why
 

9217
02:37:33,120 --> 02:37:35,429
they just give up on that well they why
are they realizing where mr musk came

9218
02:37:35,429 --> 02:37:35,439
are they realizing where mr musk came
 

9219
02:37:35,439 --> 02:37:37,750
are they realizing where mr musk came
along and then bezos and others that

9220
02:37:37,750 --> 02:37:37,760
along and then bezos and others that
 

9221
02:37:37,760 --> 02:37:39,670
along and then bezos and others that
said we can do it for one tenth the

9222
02:37:39,670 --> 02:37:39,680
said we can do it for one tenth the
 

9223
02:37:39,680 --> 02:37:41,349
said we can do it for one tenth the
price

9224
02:37:41,349 --> 02:37:41,359
price
 

9225
02:37:41,359 --> 02:37:43,750
price
so why did the why should the taxpayers

9226
02:37:43,750 --> 02:37:43,760
so why did the why should the taxpayers
 

9227
02:37:43,760 --> 02:37:45,590
so why did the why should the taxpayers
pay for the why don't you nasa do what

9228
02:37:45,590 --> 02:37:45,600
pay for the why don't you nasa do what
 

9229
02:37:45,600 --> 02:37:46,790
pay for the why don't you nasa do what
you do well

9230
02:37:46,790 --> 02:37:46,800
you do well
 

9231
02:37:46,800 --> 02:37:48,790
you do well
which is like test out cutting edge

9232
02:37:48,790 --> 02:37:48,800
which is like test out cutting edge
 

9233
02:37:48,800 --> 02:37:50,870
which is like test out cutting edge
stuff make sure they're safe

9234
02:37:50,870 --> 02:37:50,880
stuff make sure they're safe
 

9235
02:37:50,880 --> 02:37:52,070
stuff make sure they're safe
and now

9236
02:37:52,070 --> 02:37:52,080
and now
 

9237
02:37:52,080 --> 02:37:54,550
and now
that we've developed

9238
02:37:54,550 --> 02:37:54,560
that we've developed
 

9239
02:37:54,560 --> 02:37:55,750
that we've developed
a car

9240
02:37:55,750 --> 02:37:55,760
a car
 

9241
02:37:55,760 --> 02:37:59,510
a car
let us let us ups and fedex take care of

9242
02:37:59,510 --> 02:37:59,520
let us let us ups and fedex take care of
 

9243
02:37:59,520 --> 02:38:01,110
let us let us ups and fedex take care of
doing this at scale doing it cheaper

9244
02:38:01,110 --> 02:38:01,120
doing this at scale doing it cheaper
 

9245
02:38:01,120 --> 02:38:02,309
doing this at scale doing it cheaper
doing it better

9246
02:38:02,309 --> 02:38:02,319
doing it better
 

9247
02:38:02,319 --> 02:38:03,830
doing it better
i mean that's the argument

9248
02:38:03,830 --> 02:38:03,840
i mean that's the argument
 

9249
02:38:03,840 --> 02:38:05,750
i mean that's the argument
and nasa took what they realized is it

9250
02:38:05,750 --> 02:38:05,760
and nasa took what they realized is it
 

9251
02:38:05,760 --> 02:38:08,309
and nasa took what they realized is it
took way way too long to do stuff

9252
02:38:08,309 --> 02:38:08,319
took way way too long to do stuff
 

9253
02:38:08,319 --> 02:38:10,230
took way way too long to do stuff
when you're investing millions as

9254
02:38:10,230 --> 02:38:10,240
when you're investing millions as
 

9255
02:38:10,240 --> 02:38:12,790
when you're investing millions as
billions of dollars into a project

9256
02:38:12,790 --> 02:38:12,800
billions of dollars into a project
 

9257
02:38:12,800 --> 02:38:13,670
billions of dollars into a project
the

9258
02:38:13,670 --> 02:38:13,680
the
 

9259
02:38:13,680 --> 02:38:15,990
the
the bureaucracy builds up

9260
02:38:15,990 --> 02:38:16,000
the bureaucracy builds up
 

9261
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:17,910
the bureaucracy builds up
and the conservatism builds up to where

9262
02:38:17,910 --> 02:38:17,920
and the conservatism builds up to where
 

9263
02:38:17,920 --> 02:38:19,750
and the conservatism builds up to where
you're i mean you really have to test

9264
02:38:19,750 --> 02:38:19,760
you're i mean you really have to test
 

9265
02:38:19,760 --> 02:38:22,309
you're i mean you really have to test
everything out so projects take years

9266
02:38:22,309 --> 02:38:22,319
everything out so projects take years
 

9267
02:38:22,319 --> 02:38:23,590
everything out so projects take years
and then you have somebody like elon

9268
02:38:23,590 --> 02:38:23,600
and then you have somebody like elon
 

9269
02:38:23,600 --> 02:38:26,070
and then you have somebody like elon
musk coming along and says well let's do

9270
02:38:26,070 --> 02:38:26,080
musk coming along and says well let's do
 

9271
02:38:26,080 --> 02:38:27,510
musk coming along and says well let's do
launches every

9272
02:38:27,510 --> 02:38:27,520
launches every
 

9273
02:38:27,520 --> 02:38:28,870
launches every
every week

9274
02:38:28,870 --> 02:38:28,880
every week
 

9275
02:38:28,880 --> 02:38:30,309
every week
and as opposed to

9276
02:38:30,309 --> 02:38:30,319
and as opposed to
 

9277
02:38:30,319 --> 02:38:32,230
and as opposed to
just throwing away the rocket will reuse

9278
02:38:32,230 --> 02:38:32,240
just throwing away the rocket will reuse
 

9279
02:38:32,240 --> 02:38:34,309
just throwing away the rocket will reuse
the rocket that was one of the sort of

9280
02:38:34,309 --> 02:38:34,319
the rocket that was one of the sort of
 

9281
02:38:34,319 --> 02:38:36,230
the rocket that was one of the sort of
cutting edge inventions

9282
02:38:36,230 --> 02:38:36,240
cutting edge inventions
 

9283
02:38:36,240 --> 02:38:39,110
cutting edge inventions
it's a dumb obvious idea

9284
02:38:39,110 --> 02:38:39,120
it's a dumb obvious idea
 

9285
02:38:39,120 --> 02:38:41,030
it's a dumb obvious idea
like elon says why do you throw away the

9286
02:38:41,030 --> 02:38:41,040
like elon says why do you throw away the
 

9287
02:38:41,040 --> 02:38:42,790
like elon says why do you throw away the
pla it's the equivalent as if you flew a

9288
02:38:42,790 --> 02:38:42,800
pla it's the equivalent as if you flew a
 

9289
02:38:42,800 --> 02:38:44,950
pla it's the equivalent as if you flew a
plane every time you threw it away why

9290
02:38:44,950 --> 02:38:44,960
plane every time you threw it away why
 

9291
02:38:44,960 --> 02:38:46,469
plane every time you threw it away why
are we every time throwing away the

9292
02:38:46,469 --> 02:38:46,479
are we every time throwing away the
 

9293
02:38:46,479 --> 02:38:48,550
are we every time throwing away the
plane but nasa's tried that kind of

9294
02:38:48,550 --> 02:38:48,560
plane but nasa's tried that kind of
 

9295
02:38:48,560 --> 02:38:49,830
plane but nasa's tried that kind of
thing with the space shuttle since the

9296
02:38:49,830 --> 02:38:49,840
thing with the space shuttle since the
 

9297
02:38:49,840 --> 02:38:52,309
thing with the space shuttle since the
1970s yes well they did that with the

9298
02:38:52,309 --> 02:38:52,319
1970s yes well they did that with the
 

9299
02:38:52,319 --> 02:38:54,469
1970s yes well they did that with the
space shuttle but not not at the scale

9300
02:38:54,469 --> 02:38:54,479
space shuttle but not not at the scale
 

9301
02:38:54,479 --> 02:38:56,630
space shuttle but not not at the scale
here that uh it was the space shuttle

9302
02:38:56,630 --> 02:38:56,640
here that uh it was the space shuttle
 

9303
02:38:56,640 --> 02:38:58,070
here that uh it was the space shuttle
was seen as this

9304
02:38:58,070 --> 02:38:58,080
was seen as this
 

9305
02:38:58,080 --> 02:39:01,030
was seen as this
like majestic amazing thing that

9306
02:39:01,030 --> 02:39:01,040
like majestic amazing thing that
 

9307
02:39:01,040 --> 02:39:03,190
like majestic amazing thing that
requires a huge amount of investment but

9308
02:39:03,190 --> 02:39:03,200
requires a huge amount of investment but
 

9309
02:39:03,200 --> 02:39:05,349
requires a huge amount of investment but
the elo musk is like no every basic

9310
02:39:05,349 --> 02:39:05,359
the elo musk is like no every basic
 

9311
02:39:05,359 --> 02:39:06,309
the elo musk is like no every basic
rocket

9312
02:39:06,309 --> 02:39:06,319
rocket
 

9313
02:39:06,319 --> 02:39:08,550
rocket
should be reusable

9314
02:39:08,550 --> 02:39:08,560
should be reusable
 

9315
02:39:08,560 --> 02:39:09,910
should be reusable
cut cost

9316
02:39:09,910 --> 02:39:09,920
cut cost
 

9317
02:39:09,920 --> 02:39:12,070
cut cost
do you do you think like

9318
02:39:12,070 --> 02:39:12,080
do you do you think like
 

9319
02:39:12,080 --> 02:39:13,830
do you do you think like
the more technology we have the more

9320
02:39:13,830 --> 02:39:13,840
the more technology we have the more
 

9321
02:39:13,840 --> 02:39:16,309
the more technology we have the more
advanced we become the more specialized

9322
02:39:16,309 --> 02:39:16,319
advanced we become the more specialized
 

9323
02:39:16,319 --> 02:39:17,910
advanced we become the more specialized
we need to be like is that for that

9324
02:39:17,910 --> 02:39:17,920
we need to be like is that for that
 

9325
02:39:17,920 --> 02:39:19,510
we need to be like is that for that
reason that now they

9326
02:39:19,510 --> 02:39:19,520
reason that now they
 

9327
02:39:19,520 --> 02:39:21,429
reason that now they
there is different branch like you just

9328
02:39:21,429 --> 02:39:21,439
there is different branch like you just
 

9329
02:39:21,439 --> 02:39:23,270
there is different branch like you just
explained now nowadays there's precise

9330
02:39:23,270 --> 02:39:23,280
explained now nowadays there's precise
 

9331
02:39:23,280 --> 02:39:25,349
explained now nowadays there's precise
in this but they're left you know other

9332
02:39:25,349 --> 02:39:25,359
in this but they're left you know other
 

9333
02:39:25,359 --> 02:39:27,270
in this but they're left you know other
branch yeah there's there's greater and

9334
02:39:27,270 --> 02:39:27,280
branch yeah there's there's greater and
 

9335
02:39:27,280 --> 02:39:28,870
branch yeah there's there's greater and
greater specialization as we build up

9336
02:39:28,870 --> 02:39:28,880
greater specialization as we build up
 

9337
02:39:28,880 --> 02:39:31,429
greater specialization as we build up
more stuff which is fascinating because

9338
02:39:31,429 --> 02:39:31,439
more stuff which is fascinating because
 

9339
02:39:31,439 --> 02:39:34,150
more stuff which is fascinating because
is is it making us

9340
02:39:34,150 --> 02:39:34,160
is is it making us
 

9341
02:39:34,160 --> 02:39:35,110
is is it making us
more

9342
02:39:35,110 --> 02:39:35,120
more
 

9343
02:39:35,120 --> 02:39:37,590
more
dumb in a way do you think like

9344
02:39:37,590 --> 02:39:37,600
dumb in a way do you think like
 

9345
02:39:37,600 --> 02:39:39,670
dumb in a way do you think like
like yeah i don't know like

9346
02:39:39,670 --> 02:39:39,680
like yeah i don't know like
 

9347
02:39:39,680 --> 02:39:41,110
like yeah i don't know like
you you know

9348
02:39:41,110 --> 02:39:41,120
you you know
 

9349
02:39:41,120 --> 02:39:42,710
you you know
i use a cell phone but i don't know how

9350
02:39:42,710 --> 02:39:42,720
i use a cell phone but i don't know how
 

9351
02:39:42,720 --> 02:39:44,550
i use a cell phone but i don't know how
to build it up from yeah

9352
02:39:44,550 --> 02:39:44,560
to build it up from yeah
 

9353
02:39:44,560 --> 02:39:46,469
to build it up from yeah
i mean it's that beta male is building

9354
02:39:46,469 --> 02:39:46,479
i mean it's that beta male is building
 

9355
02:39:46,479 --> 02:39:49,030
i mean it's that beta male is building
up this whole society um because we're

9356
02:39:49,030 --> 02:39:49,040
up this whole society um because we're
 

9357
02:39:49,040 --> 02:39:51,510
up this whole society um because we're
this collective intelligence we rely on

9358
02:39:51,510 --> 02:39:51,520
this collective intelligence we rely on
 

9359
02:39:51,520 --> 02:39:53,429
this collective intelligence we rely on
each other more and more

9360
02:39:53,429 --> 02:39:53,439
each other more and more
 

9361
02:39:53,439 --> 02:39:54,389
each other more and more
and

9362
02:39:54,389 --> 02:39:54,399
and
 

9363
02:39:54,399 --> 02:39:55,270
and
it

9364
02:39:55,270 --> 02:39:55,280
it
 

9365
02:39:55,280 --> 02:39:57,030
it
i do also see sort of the rise of

9366
02:39:57,030 --> 02:39:57,040
i do also see sort of the rise of
 

9367
02:39:57,040 --> 02:39:58,550
i do also see sort of the rise of
conspiracy theories and all those kinds

9368
02:39:58,550 --> 02:39:58,560
conspiracy theories and all those kinds
 

9369
02:39:58,560 --> 02:40:01,830
conspiracy theories and all those kinds
of things because

9370
02:40:01,830 --> 02:40:01,840
of things because
 

9371
02:40:01,840 --> 02:40:03,590
of things because
like i've been talking to a few folks

9372
02:40:03,590 --> 02:40:03,600
like i've been talking to a few folks
 

9373
02:40:03,600 --> 02:40:05,510
like i've been talking to a few folks
about flat earth recently it's

9374
02:40:05,510 --> 02:40:05,520
about flat earth recently it's
 

9375
02:40:05,520 --> 02:40:06,550
about flat earth recently it's
fascinating

9376
02:40:06,550 --> 02:40:06,560
fascinating
 

9377
02:40:06,560 --> 02:40:07,910
fascinating
it's fascinating there's a large

9378
02:40:07,910 --> 02:40:07,920
it's fascinating there's a large
 

9379
02:40:07,920 --> 02:40:09,110
it's fascinating there's a large
community of people that believe the

9380
02:40:09,110 --> 02:40:09,120
community of people that believe the
 

9381
02:40:09,120 --> 02:40:11,510
community of people that believe the
earth is flat and

9382
02:40:11,510 --> 02:40:11,520
earth is flat and
 

9383
02:40:11,520 --> 02:40:13,750
earth is flat and
that idea takes hold in this day and age

9384
02:40:13,750 --> 02:40:13,760
that idea takes hold in this day and age
 

9385
02:40:13,760 --> 02:40:15,590
that idea takes hold in this day and age
of all the ideas that's the one that

9386
02:40:15,590 --> 02:40:15,600
of all the ideas that's the one that
 

9387
02:40:15,600 --> 02:40:18,230
of all the ideas that's the one that
takes hold for a large number of people

9388
02:40:18,230 --> 02:40:18,240
takes hold for a large number of people
 

9389
02:40:18,240 --> 02:40:19,670
takes hold for a large number of people
and

9390
02:40:19,670 --> 02:40:19,680
and
 

9391
02:40:19,680 --> 02:40:21,510
and
i think that's the consequences this

9392
02:40:21,510 --> 02:40:21,520
i think that's the consequences this
 

9393
02:40:21,520 --> 02:40:23,269
i think that's the consequences this
kind of specialization where it's just

9394
02:40:23,269 --> 02:40:23,279
kind of specialization where it's just
 

9395
02:40:23,279 --> 02:40:25,110
kind of specialization where it's just
huge amount of experts

9396
02:40:25,110 --> 02:40:25,120
huge amount of experts
 

9397
02:40:25,120 --> 02:40:27,429
huge amount of experts
but if you look out into our world and

9398
02:40:27,429 --> 02:40:27,439
but if you look out into our world and
 

9399
02:40:27,439 --> 02:40:30,389
but if you look out into our world and
try to reason simply about our existence

9400
02:40:30,389 --> 02:40:30,399
try to reason simply about our existence
 

9401
02:40:30,399 --> 02:40:32,710
try to reason simply about our existence
we we are losing the skills to do that

9402
02:40:32,710 --> 02:40:32,720
we we are losing the skills to do that
 

9403
02:40:32,720 --> 02:40:33,750
we we are losing the skills to do that
because more and more people are

9404
02:40:33,750 --> 02:40:33,760
because more and more people are
 

9405
02:40:33,760 --> 02:40:35,750
because more and more people are
specialized as opposed to general

9406
02:40:35,750 --> 02:40:35,760
specialized as opposed to general
 

9407
02:40:35,760 --> 02:40:38,389
specialized as opposed to general
thinkers we're like extremely good at

9408
02:40:38,389 --> 02:40:38,399
thinkers we're like extremely good at
 

9409
02:40:38,399 --> 02:40:41,830
thinkers we're like extremely good at
specific things are we capable now to do

9410
02:40:41,830 --> 02:40:41,840
specific things are we capable now to do
 

9411
02:40:41,840 --> 02:40:45,349
specific things are we capable now to do
uh a robot that is self-aware

9412
02:40:45,349 --> 02:40:45,359
uh a robot that is self-aware
 

9413
02:40:45,359 --> 02:40:47,349
uh a robot that is self-aware
that's that's one the legged one i need

9414
02:40:47,349 --> 02:40:47,359
that's that's one the legged one i need
 

9415
02:40:47,359 --> 02:40:49,429
that's that's one the legged one i need
uh it's self-aware like it's not

9416
02:40:49,429 --> 02:40:49,439
uh it's self-aware like it's not
 

9417
02:40:49,439 --> 02:40:50,950
uh it's self-aware like it's not
self-aware it's been listening but it's

9418
02:40:50,950 --> 02:40:50,960
self-aware it's been listening but it's
 

9419
02:40:50,960 --> 02:40:53,190
self-aware it's been listening but it's
it's not self-aware but do you think a

9420
02:40:53,190 --> 02:40:53,200
it's not self-aware but do you think a
 

9421
02:40:53,200 --> 02:40:55,990
it's not self-aware but do you think a
human being is self-aware or that's a

9422
02:40:55,990 --> 02:40:56,000
human being is self-aware or that's a
 

9423
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:57,349
human being is self-aware or that's a
good question

9424
02:40:57,349 --> 02:40:57,359
good question
 

9425
02:40:57,359 --> 02:40:59,030
good question
i mean i ask this question all the time

9426
02:40:59,030 --> 02:40:59,040
i mean i ask this question all the time
 

9427
02:40:59,040 --> 02:41:03,830
i mean i ask this question all the time
when the robots move there's a sense of

9428
02:41:03,830 --> 02:41:03,840
when the robots move there's a sense of
 

9429
02:41:03,840 --> 02:41:05,510
when the robots move there's a sense of
when they turn on

9430
02:41:05,510 --> 02:41:05,520
when they turn on
 

9431
02:41:05,520 --> 02:41:07,830
when they turn on
something entered that robot

9432
02:41:07,830 --> 02:41:07,840
something entered that robot
 

9433
02:41:07,840 --> 02:41:11,910
something entered that robot
wow and when it turns off something left

9434
02:41:11,910 --> 02:41:11,920
wow and when it turns off something left
 

9435
02:41:11,920 --> 02:41:13,670
wow and when it turns off something left
if they move in a certain kind of way

9436
02:41:13,670 --> 02:41:13,680
if they move in a certain kind of way
 

9437
02:41:13,680 --> 02:41:15,590
if they move in a certain kind of way
and if they're if they surprise you

9438
02:41:15,590 --> 02:41:15,600
and if they're if they surprise you
 

9439
02:41:15,600 --> 02:41:17,349
and if they're if they surprise you
there's certain elements

9440
02:41:17,349 --> 02:41:17,359
there's certain elements
 

9441
02:41:17,359 --> 02:41:19,590
there's certain elements
that enable us

9442
02:41:19,590 --> 02:41:19,600
that enable us
 

9443
02:41:19,600 --> 02:41:21,750
that enable us
to see the magic in

9444
02:41:21,750 --> 02:41:21,760
to see the magic in
 

9445
02:41:21,760 --> 02:41:24,070
to see the magic in
in a living being and some of them i

9446
02:41:24,070 --> 02:41:24,080
in a living being and some of them i
 

9447
02:41:24,080 --> 02:41:26,710
in a living being and some of them i
mean we can character we can maybe list

9448
02:41:26,710 --> 02:41:26,720
mean we can character we can maybe list
 

9449
02:41:26,720 --> 02:41:27,510
mean we can character we can maybe list
them

9450
02:41:27,510 --> 02:41:27,520
them
 

9451
02:41:27,520 --> 02:41:30,230
them
but it's the ability to surprise you

9452
02:41:30,230 --> 02:41:30,240
but it's the ability to surprise you
 

9453
02:41:30,240 --> 02:41:32,870
but it's the ability to surprise you
it's the

9454
02:41:32,870 --> 02:41:32,880

 

9455
02:41:32,880 --> 02:41:35,190

ability to make mistakes and learn from

9456
02:41:35,190 --> 02:41:35,200
ability to make mistakes and learn from
 

9457
02:41:35,200 --> 02:41:37,510
ability to make mistakes and learn from
them visibly there's a bunch of things

9458
02:41:37,510 --> 02:41:37,520
them visibly there's a bunch of things
 

9459
02:41:37,520 --> 02:41:39,349
them visibly there's a bunch of things
that you just

9460
02:41:39,349 --> 02:41:39,359
that you just
 

9461
02:41:39,359 --> 02:41:41,110
that you just
i don't know it just feels

9462
02:41:41,110 --> 02:41:41,120
i don't know it just feels
 

9463
02:41:41,120 --> 02:41:43,030
i don't know it just feels
like it has the magic of what is a

9464
02:41:43,030 --> 02:41:43,040
like it has the magic of what is a
 

9465
02:41:43,040 --> 02:41:45,990
like it has the magic of what is a
living being and which is what humans

9466
02:41:45,990 --> 02:41:46,000
living being and which is what humans
 

9467
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:47,910
living being and which is what humans
have and i try to think about how do you

9468
02:41:47,910 --> 02:41:47,920
have and i try to think about how do you
 

9469
02:41:47,920 --> 02:41:50,790
have and i try to think about how do you
replicate that into a machine so so when

9470
02:41:50,790 --> 02:41:50,800
replicate that into a machine so so when
 

9471
02:41:50,800 --> 02:41:53,190
replicate that into a machine so so when
you turn it on enough you feel like it

9472
02:41:53,190 --> 02:41:53,200
you turn it on enough you feel like it
 

9473
02:41:53,200 --> 02:41:55,590
you turn it on enough you feel like it
dies every time and it re reborn right

9474
02:41:55,590 --> 02:41:55,600
dies every time and it re reborn right
 

9475
02:41:55,600 --> 02:41:57,429
dies every time and it re reborn right
so for most machines we don't feel that

9476
02:41:57,429 --> 02:41:57,439
so for most machines we don't feel that
 

9477
02:41:57,439 --> 02:42:00,309
so for most machines we don't feel that
way we don't when we unplug things

9478
02:42:00,309 --> 02:42:00,319
way we don't when we unplug things
 

9479
02:42:00,319 --> 02:42:02,070
way we don't when we unplug things
we don't feel that way i don't know why

9480
02:42:02,070 --> 02:42:02,080
we don't feel that way i don't know why
 

9481
02:42:02,080 --> 02:42:03,750
we don't feel that way i don't know why
we don't feel that way that's an

9482
02:42:03,750 --> 02:42:03,760
we don't feel that way that's an
 

9483
02:42:03,760 --> 02:42:05,110
we don't feel that way that's an
interesting question

9484
02:42:05,110 --> 02:42:05,120
interesting question
 

9485
02:42:05,120 --> 02:42:08,630
interesting question
but i think when

9486
02:42:08,630 --> 02:42:08,640

 

9487
02:42:08,640 --> 02:42:11,910

when the robot has certain qualities

9488
02:42:11,910 --> 02:42:11,920
when the robot has certain qualities
 

9489
02:42:11,920 --> 02:42:13,830
when the robot has certain qualities
like memory

9490
02:42:13,830 --> 02:42:13,840
like memory
 

9491
02:42:13,840 --> 02:42:16,870
like memory
like ability to recognize you

9492
02:42:16,870 --> 02:42:16,880
like ability to recognize you
 

9493
02:42:16,880 --> 02:42:18,150
like ability to recognize you
yeah you start to feel like you're

9494
02:42:18,150 --> 02:42:18,160
yeah you start to feel like you're
 

9495
02:42:18,160 --> 02:42:19,990
yeah you start to feel like you're
turning off an organism

9496
02:42:19,990 --> 02:42:20,000
turning off an organism
 

9497
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:21,910
turning off an organism
so so whenever i have like the robots

9498
02:42:21,910 --> 02:42:21,920
so so whenever i have like the robots
 

9499
02:42:21,920 --> 02:42:23,429
so so whenever i have like the robots
that recognize me

9500
02:42:23,429 --> 02:42:23,439
that recognize me
 

9501
02:42:23,439 --> 02:42:24,710
that recognize me
and remember

9502
02:42:24,710 --> 02:42:24,720
and remember
 

9503
02:42:24,720 --> 02:42:27,190
and remember
this is important that all the things

9504
02:42:27,190 --> 02:42:27,200
this is important that all the things
 

9505
02:42:27,200 --> 02:42:29,110
this is important that all the things
we've experienced together

9506
02:42:29,110 --> 02:42:29,120
we've experienced together
 

9507
02:42:29,120 --> 02:42:31,190
we've experienced together
then it's like holy [\h__\h]

that's a living thing disappearing of

9586
02:43:51,830 --> 02:43:51,840
that's a living thing disappearing of
 

9587
02:43:51,840 --> 02:43:52,790
that's a living thing disappearing of
course that's kind of an

9588
02:43:52,790 --> 02:43:52,800
course that's kind of an
 

9589
02:43:52,800 --> 02:43:55,670
course that's kind of an
anthropomorphism we do to each other

9590

anthropomorphism we do to each other
 

9591
02:43:55,680 --> 02:43:57,830
anthropomorphism we do to each other
but uh that's something

9592
02:43:57,830 --> 02:43:57,840
but uh that's something
 

9593
02:43:57,840 --> 02:43:59,750
but uh that's something
it's you know that

9594
02:43:59,750 --> 02:43:59,760
it's you know that
 

9595
02:43:59,760 --> 02:44:01,349
it's you know that
that's some that makes me believe it's

9596
02:44:01,349 --> 02:44:01,359
that's some that makes me believe it's
 

9597
02:44:01,359 --> 02:44:05,110
that's some that makes me believe it's
possible to create um

9598
02:44:05,110 --> 02:44:05,120
possible to create um
 

9599
02:44:05,120 --> 02:44:07,030
possible to create um
systems with which we can have a

9600
02:44:07,030 --> 02:44:07,040
systems with which we can have a
 

9601
02:44:07,040 --> 02:44:08,790
systems with which we can have a
connection that are non-human

9602
02:44:08,790 --> 02:44:08,800
connection that are non-human
 

9603
02:44:08,800 --> 02:44:11,830
connection that are non-human
like similar to dogs and cats and so on

9604
02:44:11,830 --> 02:44:11,840
like similar to dogs and cats and so on
 

9605
02:44:11,840 --> 02:44:13,030
like similar to dogs and cats and so on
it just makes me

9606
02:44:13,030 --> 02:44:13,040
it just makes me
 

9607
02:44:13,040 --> 02:44:14,389
it just makes me
and that's what's interesting to me

9608
02:44:14,389 --> 02:44:14,399
and that's what's interesting to me
 

9609
02:44:14,399 --> 02:44:16,070
and that's what's interesting to me
because ultimately i feel like they'll

9610
02:44:16,070 --> 02:44:16,080
because ultimately i feel like they'll
 

9611
02:44:16,080 --> 02:44:17,590
because ultimately i feel like they'll
help us understand

9612
02:44:17,590 --> 02:44:17,600
help us understand
 

9613
02:44:17,600 --> 02:44:20,150
help us understand
ourselves

9614
02:44:20,150 --> 02:44:20,160

 

9615
02:44:20,160 --> 02:44:22,070

and maybe practice grappling moves

9616
02:44:22,070 --> 02:44:22,080
and maybe practice grappling moves
 

9617
02:44:22,080 --> 02:44:26,630
and maybe practice grappling moves
anyway um

9618
02:44:26,630 --> 02:44:26,640

 

9619
02:44:26,640 --> 02:44:29,670
