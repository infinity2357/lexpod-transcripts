maybe what are psychedelics and
 

135
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,150
maybe what are psychedelics and
what are the kinds of psychedelics out

136
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:14,160
what are the kinds of psychedelics out
 

137
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,110
what are the kinds of psychedelics out
there and

138
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:15,120
there and
 

139
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,630
there and
in whatever way you find meaningful to

140
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:16,640
in whatever way you find meaningful to
 

141
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,309
in whatever way you find meaningful to
categorize yeah

142
00:02:18,309 --> 00:02:18,319
categorize yeah
 

143
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,430
categorize yeah
you can categorize them by their

144
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:21,440
you can categorize them by their
 

145
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,110
you can categorize them by their
chemical structure

146
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:23,120
chemical structure
 

147
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,470
chemical structure
so phenethylamines tryptamines

148
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:26,480
so phenethylamines tryptamines
 

149
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,910
so phenethylamines tryptamines
ergolines um that

150
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:29,920
ergolines um that
 

151
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,710
ergolines um that
is is less of a meaningful way to

152
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:32,720
is is less of a meaningful way to
 

153
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,030
is is less of a meaningful way to
classify them i think that they're

154
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:35,040
classify them i think that they're
 

155
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,990

activity their receptor activity is the

158

activity their receptor activity is the
 

159
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,110
activity their receptor activity is the
best way

160
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:39,120
best way
 

161
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,470
best way
well let me let me start even broader

162
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:40,480
well let me let me start even broader
 

163
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,509
well let me let me start even broader
than that because there i'm talking

164
00:02:41,509 --> 00:02:41,519
than that because there i'm talking
 

165
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,509
than that because there i'm talking
about the classic psychedelics

166
00:02:43,509 --> 00:02:43,519
about the classic psychedelics
 

167
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,750
about the classic psychedelics
so broadly speaking when we say

168
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:45,760
so broadly speaking when we say
 

169
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,150

that you know people informally refer to

230
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:57,920
that you know people informally refer to
 

231
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,229
that you know people informally refer to
them

232
00:03:58,229 --> 00:03:58,239
them
 

233
00:03:58,239 --> 00:03:59,670
them
as psychedelic and i think what that

234
00:03:59,670 --> 00:03:59,680
as psychedelic and i think what that
 

235
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,149
as psychedelic and i think what that
overlap is you know compared to say

236
00:04:02,149 --> 00:04:02,159
overlap is you know compared to say
 

237
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,030
overlap is you know compared to say
you know caffeine and cocaine and you

238
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:05,040
you know caffeine and cocaine and you
 

239
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,830
you know caffeine and cocaine and you
know ambien

240
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:05,840
know ambien
 

241
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,830
know ambien
etc um other psychoactive drugs is that

242
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:09,840
etc um other psychoactive drugs is that
 

243
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,190
etc um other psychoactive drugs is that
they have strong effects in altering

244
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:13,200
they have strong effects in altering
 

245
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,629
they have strong effects in altering
one's sense of reality and including the

246
00:04:16,629 --> 00:04:16,639
one's sense of reality and including the
 

247
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:17,830
one's sense of reality and including the
sense of self

248
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:17,840
sense of self
 

249
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,270
sense of self
and i should throw in there that that

250
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:19,280
and i should throw in there that that
 

251
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,830
and i should throw in there that that
cannabis more historically like in the

252
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:21,840
cannabis more historically like in the
 

253
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,909
cannabis more historically like in the
70s has been called a minor psychedelic

254
00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:23,919
70s has been called a minor psychedelic
 

255
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,430
70s has been called a minor psychedelic
and i think with that latter definition

256
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:25,440
and i think with that latter definition
 

257
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:25,909
and i think with that latter definition
it

258
00:04:25,909 --> 00:04:25,919
it
 

259
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,310
it
it does fit that definition particularly

260
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:28,320
it does fit that definition particularly
 

261
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,310
it does fit that definition particularly
if one doesn't have a tolerance

262
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:30,320
if one doesn't have a tolerance
 

263
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,430
if one doesn't have a tolerance
so you mentioned serotonin so most of

264
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:33,440
so you mentioned serotonin so most of
 

265
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,110
so you mentioned serotonin so most of
the effect comes from something around

266
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:35,120
the effect comes from something around
 

267
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,790
the effect comes from something around
like the the chemistry

268
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:36,800
like the the chemistry
 

269
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,030
like the the chemistry
around neurotransmitters and so on so

270
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:39,040
around neurotransmitters and so on so
 

271
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,469
around neurotransmitters and so on so
it's uh

272
00:04:40,469 --> 00:04:40,479
it's uh
 

273
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,790
it's uh
chemical interactions in in the brain or

274
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:42,800
chemical interactions in in the brain or
 

275
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,469
chemical interactions in in the brain or
is there other kinds of interactions

276
00:04:44,469 --> 00:04:44,479
is there other kinds of interactions
 

277
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,150
is there other kinds of interactions
that have this kind of

278
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:46,160
that have this kind of
 

279
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,749
that have this kind of
perception and self-awareness altering

280
00:04:49,749 --> 00:04:49,759
perception and self-awareness altering
 

281
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,110
perception and self-awareness altering
effects

282
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:51,120
effects
 

283
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,909
effects
well as far as we know all of the the

284
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:53,919
well as far as we know all of the the
 

285
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,110
well as far as we know all of the the
psychedelics of all the different

286
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:55,120
psychedelics of all the different
 

287
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,870
psychedelics of all the different
classes

classes
 

289
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,469
classes
we've we've talked about

290
00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:00,479

 

291
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,710

their major activity is caused by

00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:02,720
their major activity is caused by
 

293
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,150
their major activity is caused by
receptor level

294
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:04,160

299
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,950

words neurotransmission operates by

300
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:12,960
words neurotransmission operates by
 

301
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,670
words neurotransmission operates by
you know one neuron releasing

302
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:15,680
you know one neuron releasing
 

303
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,909
you know one neuron releasing
neurotransmitter into a synapse a gap

304
00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:17,919
neurotransmitter into a synapse a gap
 

305
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,590
neurotransmitter into a synapse a gap
between the two neurons and then the

306
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:19,600
between the two neurons and then the
 

307
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,749
between the two neurons and then the
other neuron

308
00:05:21,749 --> 00:05:21,759
other neuron
 

309
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,070
other neuron
receives they have it has receptors that

310
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:24,080
receives they have it has receptors that
 

311
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,590
receives they have it has receptors that
receives and then there can be an act

312
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:25,600
receives and then there can be an act
 

313
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,870

activation
 

315
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,790
activation
um you know caused by that so it's like

316
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:28,800
um you know caused by that so it's like
 

317
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,150
um you know caused by that so it's like
a pitcher and a catcher

318

a pitcher and a catcher
 

319
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,189
a pitcher and a catcher
so all of the major psychedelics work by

320
00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:33,199
so all of the major psychedelics work by
 

321
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,830
so all of the major psychedelics work by
either acting as a pitcher mimicking a a

a a pitcher or a catcher so for example
 

327
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,350
a a pitcher or a catcher so for example
the classic psychedelics

328
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:41,360
the classic psychedelics
 

329
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,390
the classic psychedelics
they fit into the same catcher's mitt on

330
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:44,400
they fit into the same catcher's mitt on
 

331
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,749
they fit into the same catcher's mitt on
the post receptor

332
00:05:45,749 --> 00:05:45,759
the post receptor
 

333
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,469
the post receptor
uh post-synaptic receptor side as

334
00:05:48,469 --> 00:05:48,479
uh post-synaptic receptor side as
 

335
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:49,990

serotonin itself
 

337
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,749

00:05:51,749 --> 00:05:51,759
but they do a slightly different thing
 

339
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,310
but they do a slightly different thing
to the to the cell to the neuron

than serotonin does um there's a
 

343
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,629
than serotonin does um there's a
different signaling pathway after that

that in the physical exercise space
i think there are exercises that are

592
00:09:59,910 --> 00:09:59,920
i think there are exercises that are
 

593
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,670
i think there are exercises that are
easier on the body than others but

and one of the ways that where it
 

601
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,069
and one of the ways that where it
differs is that

602
00:10:08,069 --> 00:10:08,079
differs is that
 

603
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,630
differs is that

should say that that with the classic
 

809
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,269
should say that that with the classic
psychedelics that lsd is sort of

you can call it a semi-synthetic because
 

813
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,389
you can call it a semi-synthetic because
there's there's there's

there's there's there's
 

815
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,710
there's there's there's
natural you know from from both ergot

816
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:30,720
natural you know from from both ergot
 

817
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,310
natural you know from from both ergot
and in certain seeds

818
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:32,320
and in certain seeds
 

819
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,710
and in certain seeds
um uh morning glory seeds is one example

820
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:34,720
um uh morning glory seeds is one example
 

821

um uh morning glory seeds is one example
there's a very close

822
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:36,000
there's a very close
 

823
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,430
there's a very close
there are some very close uh chemical

824
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:39,440
there are some very close uh chemical
 

825
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,189
there are some very close uh chemical
relatives of lsd so

826
00:13:41,189 --> 00:13:41,199
relatives of lsd so
 

827
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,430
relatives of lsd so
lsd is close to what occurs in nature

828
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:43,440
lsd is close to what occurs in nature
 

829
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,710
lsd is close to what occurs in nature
but not quite it's

830
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:44,720
but not quite it's
 

831
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,870
but not quite it's
but then when we get into the the other

832
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:46,880
but then when we get into the the other
 

833
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,990

it starts entering this territory where
 

959
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,189
it starts entering this territory where
you got to be careful about the risks

you got to be careful about the risks

00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,629
you got to be careful about the risks

push the dose up as high
 

967
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,949
push the dose up as high
as you safely um as one can if they're

as you safely um as one can if they're

in the right setting like in our
 

971
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:04,870
in the right setting like in our
research

972
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:04,880

the just the nature of the effects with

00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,550
the just the nature of the effects with
mdma aren't the full

on psychedelic it's not the full journey
 

985
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,949
on psychedelic it's not the full journey
you know so it's sort of a psychedelic

you know so it's sort of a psychedelic

relatively speaking that said at most
 

1013
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,910
relatively speaking that said at most
doses and of classic psychedelics you

but if that's a subset of what the
 

1065
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,390
but if that's a subset of what the
classic psychedelics do so i see mdma in

1066
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:42,400
classic psychedelics do so i see mdma in
 

1067
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,230
classic psychedelics do so i see mdma in
terms of its subjective effects

1068
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:44,240
terms of its subjective effects
 

1069
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,430
terms of its subjective effects
is if you think about um venn diagrams

1070
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:47,440
is if you think about um venn diagrams
 

1071
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,070
is if you think about um venn diagrams
it's sort of

1072
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:48,080
it's sort of
 

1073
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,750
it's sort of
mdma is all within the classic

everything that you see on a particular

everything that you see on a particular
 

1079
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,230
everything that you see on a particular
mdma session

1080
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:54,240
mdma session
 

1081
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,549
mdma session
sometimes a psilocybin session looks

1082
00:17:56,549 --> 00:17:56,559
sometimes a psilocybin session looks
 

1083
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:57,990
sometimes a psilocybin session looks
just like that

1084
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:58,000
just like that
 

1085
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,590
just like that
but then sometimes it's completely

1086
00:17:59,590 --> 00:17:59,600
but then sometimes it's completely
 

1087
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,789
but then sometimes it's completely
different with psilocybin it's a little

1088
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:00,799
different with psilocybin it's a little
 

1089
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,230
different with psilocybin it's a little
more

1090
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:02,240
more
 

1091
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,830
more
narrowed in terms of the variability

1092
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:03,840
narrowed in terms of the variability
 

1093
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,310
narrowed in terms of the variability
with mdma is there something general to

1094
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:06,320
with mdma is there something general to

you mentioned kind of an ego loss

1102
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:13,840
you mentioned kind of an ego loss
 

1103
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,390
you mentioned kind of an ego loss
experience in the space of van diagrams

1104
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:16,400
experience in the space of van diagrams
 

1105
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,909
experience in the space of van diagrams
if we're to like draw a big circle

1106
00:18:19,909 --> 00:18:19,919
if we're to like draw a big circle
 

1107
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,510
if we're to like draw a big circle
what can we say about that big circle

1108
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:23,520
what can we say about that big circle
 

1109
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,990
what can we say about that big circle
in terms of people's report of

1110
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:26,000
in terms of people's report of
 

1111
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,870
in terms of people's report of
subjective

1112
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:26,880
subjective
 

1113
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,150
subjective
experience probably one of the

1114
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:30,160
experience probably one of the
 

1115
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,990
experience probably one of the
most general things we can say is that

1116
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:32,000
most general things we can say is that
 

1117
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,230
most general things we can say is that
it it expands

1118
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:34,240
it it expands
 

1119
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,789
it it expands
that range so many people come out of

1120
00:18:36,789 --> 00:18:36,799
that range so many people come out of
 

1121
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,230
that range so many people come out of
these sessions

1122
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:38,240
these sessions
 

1123
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,190
these sessions
saying that they didn't know it was

1124
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:41,200
saying that they didn't know it was
 

1125
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,909
saying that they didn't know it was
possible to have an experience like that

1126
00:18:43,909 --> 00:18:43,919
possible to have an experience like that
 

1127
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,310
possible to have an experience like that
so there's an emphasis on the subjective

1128
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:46,320
so there's an emphasis on the subjective
 

1129
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,990
so there's an emphasis on the subjective
experience that

1130
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:48,000
experience that
 

1131
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,510
experience that
um is is there words that people put it

1132
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:51,520
um is is there words that people put it
 

1133
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,950
um is is there words that people put it
put to it that capture that experience

1134
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:54,960
put to it that capture that experience
 

1135
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,390
put to it that capture that experience
or is it something that just has to be

1136
00:18:58,390 --> 00:18:58,400
or is it something that just has to be
 

1137
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,830
or is it something that just has to be
experienced

1138
00:18:59,830 --> 00:18:59,840
experienced
 

1139
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,710
experienced
yeah people like as a researcher that's

1140
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:02,720
yeah people like as a researcher that's
 

1141
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,070
yeah people like as a researcher that's
an interesting question because you have

1142
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:04,080
an interesting question because you have
 

1143
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,029
an interesting question because you have
to kind of

1144
00:19:05,029 --> 00:19:05,039
to kind of
 

1145
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:09,270
to kind of
measure the effects

1146
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:09,280
measure the effects
 

1147
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,909
measure the effects
of this and uh how do you convert that

1148
00:19:11,909 --> 00:19:11,919
of this and uh how do you convert that
 

1149
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:13,029
of this and uh how do you convert that
into numbers

1150
00:19:13,029 --> 00:19:13,039
into numbers
 

1151
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,190
into numbers
right that that's that's the ultimate

1152
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:15,200
right that that's that's the ultimate
 

1153
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,549
right that that's that's the ultimate
child so how is that even

1154
00:19:16,549 --> 00:19:16,559
child so how is that even
 

1155
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,789
child so how is that even
is that possible to one convert it into

1156
00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:18,799
is that possible to one convert it into
 

1157
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:19,590
is that possible to one convert it into
words

1158
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:19,600
words
 

1159
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,190
words
and the second convert the words into

1160
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:21,200
and the second convert the words into
 

1161
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,430
and the second convert the words into
numbers somehow so we do a lot of that

1162
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:23,440
numbers somehow so we do a lot of that
 

1163
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,190
numbers somehow so we do a lot of that
with questionnaires you know some of

1164
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:25,200
with questionnaires you know some of
 

1165
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,190
with questionnaires you know some of
which are very psychometrically

1166
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:27,200
which are very psychometrically
 

1167
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,710
which are very psychometrically
validated so they've

1168
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:28,720
validated so they've
 

1169
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,230
validated so they've
lots of numbers have been crunched on

1170
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:30,240
lots of numbers have been crunched on
 

1171
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,150
lots of numbers have been crunched on
them and there's always a limitation

1172
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:32,160
them and there's always a limitation
 

1173
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:32,630
them and there's always a limitation

with questionnaires i mean subjective

effects are subjective effects

1178
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:35,440
effects are subjective effects
 

1179
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,830
effects are subjective effects
ultimately it's what the person is

1180
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:37,840
ultimately it's what the person is
 

1181
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,710
ultimately it's what the person is
reporting

towards
a ground truth um what what they're

a ground truth um what what they're
 

1189
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,029
a ground truth um what what they're
so for example if someone says that it

1190
00:19:47,029 --> 00:19:47,039
so for example if someone says that it
 

1191
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,230

that's a domain i'm very interested in

1247
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,470
to say about that in terms of validating
those types of claims but it's even

00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:46,480
those types of claims but it's even
 

1249
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,070
those types of claims but it's even
interesting just to see what people say

00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:48,080
interesting just to see what people say
 

1251
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,990
interesting just to see what people say
along those lines so you're interested

1252
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:50,000
along those lines so you're interested
 

1253
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,190
along those lines so you're interested
in saying like can we

1254
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:51,200
in saying like can we
 

1255
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,750
in saying like can we
more rigorously study this process of

more rigorously study this process of

00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,870
more rigorously study this process of
expansion like

1258
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:54,880
expansion like
 

1259
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,750
expansion like
what do we mean by this expansion of

1260
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:57,760
what do we mean by this expansion of
 

1261
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,549
what do we mean by this expansion of
your

your

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,990
sense of what is possible in the

00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:02,000
experiences in this
 

1267
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,149
experiences in this
world right as much as what we can say

1268
00:21:04,149 --> 00:21:04,159
world right as much as what we can say
 

1269
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:05,270
world right as much as what we can say
about that

1270
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:05,280
about that
 

1271
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,590
about that
through naturalistic psychology right

1272
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:07,600
through naturalistic psychology right
 

1273
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,390
through naturalistic psychology right
especially as much as we can route it to

1274
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:10,400
especially as much as we can route it to
 

1275
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,510
especially as much as we can route it to
um solid psychological constructs and

1276
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:13,520
um solid psychological constructs and
 

1277
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,070
um solid psychological constructs and
solid

1278
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:14,080
solid
 

1279
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,710
solid
neuroscientific constructs and i wonder

1280
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:16,720
neuroscientific constructs and i wonder
 

1281
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,950
neuroscientific constructs and i wonder
what the impact is of the language that

1282
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:18,960
what the impact is of the language that
 

1283
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,390
what the impact is of the language that
you bring to the table

1284
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:20,400
you bring to the table
 

1285
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,070
you bring to the table
so you mentioned about god or um

1286
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:24,080
so you mentioned about god or um
 

1287
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,669
so you mentioned about god or um
speaking of god a lot of people are

1288
00:21:25,669 --> 00:21:25,679
speaking of god a lot of people are
 

1289
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,350
speaking of god a lot of people are
really into sort of theoretical physics

1290
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:27,360
really into sort of theoretical physics
 

1291
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,350
really into sort of theoretical physics
these days at a very surface level

1292
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:29,360
these days at a very surface level
 

1293
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,190
these days at a very surface level
and you can bring the language of

1294
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:31,200
and you can bring the language of
 

1295
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,950
and you can bring the language of
physics right you can talk about quantum

1296
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:32,960
physics right you can talk about quantum
 

1297
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,750
physics right you can talk about quantum
mechanics

1298

mechanics
 

1299
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,430

you can talk about general general

1300
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:35,440
you can talk about general general
 

1301
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,950
you can talk about general general
relativity and

1302
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:36,960
relativity and
 

1303
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,430
relativity and
curvature space-time and using just that

00:21:44,149 --> 00:21:44,159
of it to somehow start
 

1311
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:47,110
of it to somehow start
thinking like sort of visualizing atoms

1312
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:47,120
thinking like sort of visualizing atoms
 

1313
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:47,909

in your head
 

1315
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,710
in your head
and somehow through that process because

1316
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:50,720
and somehow through that process because
 

1317
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,830
and somehow through that process because
you have the language

1318
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:51,840
you have the language
 

1319
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,470
you have the language
using that language to kind of dissolve

1320

using that language to kind of dissolve
 

1321
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,110
using that language to kind of dissolve
the ego

1322

the ego
 

1323
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,590
the ego
like realize like that we're just all

1324
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:57,600
like realize like that we're just all
 

1325
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,789
like realize like that we're just all
little bits

1326
00:21:58,789 --> 00:21:58,799
little bits
 

1327
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,270
little bits
of physical objects that behave in

1328
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:01,280
of physical objects that behave in
 

1329
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,630
of physical objects that behave in
mysterious ways

1330
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:02,640
mysterious ways
 

1331
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,070
mysterious ways
and so that that has to do with the

1332
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:04,080
and so that that has to do with the
 

1333
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,149
and so that that has to do with the
language like if you read a sean carroll

1334
00:22:06,149 --> 00:22:06,159
language like if you read a sean carroll
 

1335
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,909
language like if you read a sean carroll
book or something recently

1336
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:07,919
book or something recently
 

1337
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,070
book or something recently
it seems like as a huge influence on the

1338
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:10,080
it seems like as a huge influence on the
 

1339
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,830
it seems like as a huge influence on the
way you

1340
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:11,840
way you
 

1341
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,710
way you
might experience my perceive the world i

1342
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:14,720
might experience my perceive the world i
 

1343
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,990
might experience my perceive the world i
might experience

1344
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:16,000
might experience
 

1345
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,430
might experience
the alteration that psychedelics brings

1346
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:19,440
the alteration that psychedelics brings
 

1347
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,110
the alteration that psychedelics brings
to the um to the your perception system

1348
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:23,120
to the um to the your perception system
 

1349
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,029
to the um to the your perception system
so i wonder like the language you bring

1350
00:22:25,029 --> 00:22:25,039
so i wonder like the language you bring
 

1351
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,510
so i wonder like the language you bring
to the table how that affects

1352
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:27,520
to the table how that affects
 

1353
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,350
to the table how that affects
the journey you go on with the

1354
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:29,360
the journey you go on with the
 

1355
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,029
the journey you go on with the
psychedelics i think

1356
00:22:31,029 --> 00:22:31,039
psychedelics i think
 

1357
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:34,070
psychedelics i think
very much so and and i think there's i'm

1358
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:34,080
very much so and and i think there's i'm
 

1359
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,510
very much so and and i think there's i'm
a little concerned some of the science

1360
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:35,520
a little concerned some of the science
 

1361
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,789
a little concerned some of the science
is going a little too far in the

1362
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:36,799
is going a little too far in the
 

1363
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:37,990
is going a little too far in the
direction of

1364
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:38,000
direction of
 

1365
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,789
direction of
of around the edges you know speaking

1366
00:22:40,789 --> 00:22:40,799
of around the edges you know speaking
 

1367
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:41,830
of around the edges you know speaking
about

1368
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:41,840
about
 

1369
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,870
about
it changing beliefs in this sense or

1370
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:44,880
it changing beliefs in this sense or
 

1371
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,990
it changing beliefs in this sense or
that sense

1372
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:46,000
that sense
 

1373
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,549
that sense
about particular in particular domains

1374
00:22:48,549 --> 00:22:48,559
about particular in particular domains
 

1375
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,470
about particular in particular domains
and i think what really what

1376
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:50,480
and i think what really what
 

1377
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,990
and i think what really what
a lot of what's going on is what you

1378
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:52,000
a lot of what's going on is what you
 

1379
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,990
a lot of what's going on is what you
just discussed it's it's

1380
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:54,000
just discussed it's it's
 

1381
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,950
just discussed it's it's
the priors coming into into it so if

1382
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:56,960
the priors coming into into it so if
 

1383
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,470
the priors coming into into it so if
you've been reading a lot of

1384
00:22:58,470 --> 00:22:58,480
you've been reading a lot of
 

1385
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,990
you've been reading a lot of
you know um physics then you might

1386
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:02,000
you know um physics then you might
 

1387
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,710
you know um physics then you might
you know um bring up you know like you

1388
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:04,720
you know um bring up you know like you
 

1389
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,470
you know um bring up you know like you
know space-time and interpret the

1390
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:06,480
know space-time and interpret the
 

1391
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,270
know space-time and interpret the
experience

1392
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:07,280
experience
 

1393
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,110
experience
in that sense i mean it's not uncommon

1394
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:09,120
in that sense i mean it's not uncommon
 

1395
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,390
in that sense i mean it's not uncommon
for people to come out talking about

1396
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:10,400
for people to come out talking about
 

1397
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,110
for people to come out talking about
visions of the it's not the most typical

1398
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:13,120
visions of the it's not the most typical
 

1399
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,110
visions of the it's not the most typical
thing but it's come up in sessions i've

1400
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:15,120
thing but it's come up in sessions i've
 

1401
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:15,990
thing but it's come up in sessions i've
guided um

1402
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:16,000
guided um
 

1403
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,110
guided um
the big bang um and the

1404
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:19,120
the big bang um and the
 

1405
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,789
the big bang um and the
you know this sort of nature of reality

1406
00:23:20,789 --> 00:23:20,799
you know this sort of nature of reality
 

1407
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,510
you know this sort of nature of reality
i i think probably the the best way to

1408
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:23,520
i i think probably the the best way to
 

1409
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,710
i i think probably the the best way to
think about these

1410
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:24,720
think about these
 

1411
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,950
think about these
experiences is that and the best

1412
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:26,960
experiences is that and the best
 

1413
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,149
experiences is that and the best
evidence even though we're in our

1414
00:23:28,149 --> 00:23:28,159
evidence even though we're in our
 

1415
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:29,990
evidence even though we're in our
infancy and understanding it

1416
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:30,000
infancy and understanding it
 

1417
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,310
infancy and understanding it
the they really tap into more general

1418
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:32,320
the they really tap into more general
 

1419
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,549
the they really tap into more general
psychological mechanisms

1420
00:23:34,549 --> 00:23:34,559
psychological mechanisms
 

1421
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,149
psychological mechanisms
i think one of the best arguments is

1422
00:23:36,149 --> 00:23:36,159
i think one of the best arguments is
 

1423
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:37,750
i think one of the best arguments is
they they they

1424
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:37,760
they they they
 

1425
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,070
they they they
they reduce the influence of the of our

1426
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:40,080
they reduce the influence of the of our
 

1427
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,269
they reduce the influence of the of our
priors

1428
00:23:41,269 --> 00:23:41,279
priors
 

1429
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:44,710
priors
of what we bring into the all of the

1430
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:44,720
of what we bring into the all of the
 

1431
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,070
of what we bring into the all of the
assumptions that we all that

1432
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:46,080
assumptions that we all that
 

1433
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,590
assumptions that we all that
you know we're essentially especially as

1434
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:47,600
you know we're essentially especially as
 

1435
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,350
you know we're essentially especially as
adults we're riding on top of heuristic

1436
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:49,360
adults we're riding on top of heuristic
 

1437
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,750
adults we're riding on top of heuristic
after heuristic to get through life

1438
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:51,760
after heuristic to get through life
 

1439
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,590
after heuristic to get through life
and you need to do that and that's a

1440
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:53,600
and you need to do that and that's a
 

1441
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,029
and you need to do that and that's a
good thing and that's extremely

1442
00:23:55,029 --> 00:23:55,039
good thing and that's extremely
 

1443
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:57,510
good thing and that's extremely
efficient and evolution has shaped that

1444
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:57,520
efficient and evolution has shaped that
 

1445
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,029
efficient and evolution has shaped that
but that comes at an expense and i

1446
00:24:01,029 --> 00:24:01,039
but that comes at an expense and i
 

1447
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,710
but that comes at an expense and i
it seems that these experiences

1448
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:04,720
it seems that these experiences
 

1449
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:09,110
it seems that these experiences
will will allow someone greater

1450
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:09,120
will will allow someone greater
 

1451
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,950
will will allow someone greater
mental flexibility and openness and so

1452
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:12,960
mental flexibility and openness and so
 

1453
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,990
mental flexibility and openness and so
one can be both less

1454
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:16,000
one can be both less
 

1455
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,070
one can be both less
influenced by their their prior

1456
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:18,080
influenced by their their prior
 

1457
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,950
influenced by their their prior
assumptions but still nonetheless

1458
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:20,960
assumptions but still nonetheless
 

1459
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,390
assumptions but still nonetheless
the nature of the experience can be

1460
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:22,400
the nature of the experience can be
 

1461
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,390
the nature of the experience can be
influenced by what they've been exposed

1462
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:24,400
influenced by what they've been exposed
 

1463
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:24,710
influenced by what they've been exposed
to

1464
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:24,720
to
 

1465
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,390
to
in the world and sometimes they can get

1466
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:26,400
in the world and sometimes they can get
 

1467
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,310
in the world and sometimes they can get
it at a deep in a deeper way

1468
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:28,320
it at a deep in a deeper way
 

1469
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,750
it at a deep in a deeper way
like maybe they've read i mean i had a

1470
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:29,760
like maybe they've read i mean i had a
 

1471
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,990
like maybe they've read i mean i had a
philosophy professor one time as a

1472
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:32,000
philosophy professor one time as a
 

1473
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,750
philosophy professor one time as a
participant yeah in a high-dose

1474
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:33,760
participant yeah in a high-dose
 

1475
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,990
participant yeah in a high-dose
psilocybin study and he's like

1476
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:36,000
psilocybin study and he's like
 

1477
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,390
psilocybin study and he's like
i remember him saying my god it's like

1478
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:38,400
i remember him saying my god it's like
 

1479
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,110
i remember him saying my god it's like
hegel's

1480
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:39,120
hegel's
 

1481
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,110
hegel's
opposites defining each other like i get

1482
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:41,120
opposites defining each other like i get
 

1483
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,549
opposites defining each other like i get
it i've taught this thing

1484
00:24:42,549 --> 00:24:42,559
it i've taught this thing
 

1485
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:45,190
it i've taught this thing
for years and years and years like i get

1486
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:45,200
for years and years and years like i get

psychological emotional level like the
 

1495

psychological emotional level like the
cancer patients um we worked with

1496
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:54,480
cancer patients um we worked with
 

1497
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,909
cancer patients um we worked with
you know they told themselves a million

1498
00:24:55,909 --> 00:24:55,919
you know they told themselves a million
 

1499
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,110
you know they told themselves a million
times or this people trying to quit

1500
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:57,120
times or this people trying to quit
 

1501
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,549
times or this people trying to quit
smoking i need to quit smoking

1502
00:24:58,549 --> 00:24:58,559
smoking i need to quit smoking
 

1503
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,630
smoking i need to quit smoking
oh i'm ruining my life with this cancer

1504
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:00,640
oh i'm ruining my life with this cancer
 

1505
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,750
oh i'm ruining my life with this cancer
i'm still healthy i should be getting

1506
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:01,760
i'm still healthy i should be getting
 

1507
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,430
i'm still healthy i should be getting
out i'm letting this thing defeat me

1508
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:03,440
out i'm letting this thing defeat me
 

1509
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,710
out i'm letting this thing defeat me
it's like yeah you told yourself that in

1510
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:04,720
it's like yeah you told yourself that in
 

1511
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,990
it's like yeah you told yourself that in
your head but sometimes they have these

1512
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:06,000
your head but sometimes they have these
 

1513
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,590
your head but sometimes they have these
experiences

1514
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:07,600
experiences
 

1515
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,990
experiences
and they kind of feel it in their heart

1516
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:10,000
and they kind of feel it in their heart
 

1517
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,830
and they kind of feel it in their heart
like they really get it

1518
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:11,840
like they really get it
 

1519
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,190
like they really get it
so in some sense that

1520
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:15,200

 

1521
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,990

you bring some prize to the table but

1522
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:18,000
you bring some prize to the table but
 

1523
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,710
you bring some prize to the table but
psychedelics allow you to

1524
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:20,720
psychedelics allow you to
 

1525
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,789
psychedelics allow you to
acknowledge them and then throw them

1526
00:25:22,789 --> 00:25:22,799
acknowledge them and then throw them
 

1527
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:23,990
acknowledge them and then throw them
away so like

1528
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:24,000
away so like
 

1529
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,630
away so like

there's huge potential there

there's huge potential there
 

1581
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,549
there's huge potential there
and it's there was some research in the

and it's there was some research in the
 

1583

experience you know so to this i i think

1616
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:54,720
experience you know so to this i i think
 

1617
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,310
experience you know so to this i i think
there's incredible potential there and

1618
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:56,320
there's incredible potential there and
 

1619
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,510
there's incredible potential there and
we know

1620
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:57,520
we know
 

1621
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,750
we know
really next there's no rigorous research

1622
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:01,760
really next there's no rigorous research
 

1623
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,310
really next there's no rigorous research
on that but is there anecdotal stuff

1624
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:04,320
on that but is there anecdotal stuff
 

1625
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,149
on that but is there anecdotal stuff
like with steve jobs they think their

1626
00:27:06,149 --> 00:27:06,159
like with steve jobs they think their
 

1627
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:07,590
like with steve jobs they think their
stories right

1628
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:07,600
stories right
 

1629
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,430
stories right
in your exploration of the is there

1630
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:09,440
in your exploration of the is there
 

1631
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,830
in your exploration of the is there
something a little bit more than just

1632
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:11,840
something a little bit more than just
 

1633
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,310
something a little bit more than just
stories is there like a little bit more

1634
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:14,320
stories is there like a little bit more
 

1635
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,310
stories is there like a little bit more
of a solid data points

1636
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:16,320
of a solid data points
 

1637
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,590
of a solid data points
even if they're just experiential like

1638
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:19,600
even if they're just experiential like
 

1639
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,750
even if they're just experiential like
anecdotes is there something that you

1640
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:21,760
anecdotes is there something that you
 

1641
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,430
anecdotes is there something that you
draw inspiration from like in your

1642
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:23,440
draw inspiration from like in your
 

1643
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,149
draw inspiration from like in your
intuition

1644
00:27:24,149 --> 00:27:24,159
intuition
 

1645
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:25,830
intuition
because we'll talk about it you're

1646

because we'll talk about it you're
 

1647
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,269
because we'll talk about it you're
trying to construct studies that are

00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:18,630
forefront of research here
there's just kind of anecdotal stories

1812
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:18,640
there's just kind of anecdotal stories
 

1813
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,190
there's just kind of anecdotal stories
there's

1814

there's
 

1815
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,789
there's
uh early studies there's a sense that

1816
00:30:22,789 --> 00:30:22,799
uh early studies there's a sense that
 

1817
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,549
uh early studies there's a sense that
we don't understand very much but

1818
00:30:24,549 --> 00:30:24,559
we don't understand very much but
 

1819
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,549
we don't understand very much but
there's a lot of depth here

1820
00:30:26,549 --> 00:30:26,559
there's a lot of depth here
 

1821
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:29,350
there's a lot of depth here
how do we get from there to where elon

1822
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:29,360
how do we get from there to where elon
 

1823
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:29,830
how do we get from there to where elon
and i

1824
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:29,840
and i
 

1825
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,470
and i
can regularly like i wake up every

1826
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:32,480
can regularly like i wake up every
 

1827

morning i have deep
 

1829
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:38,470
morning i have deep
work sessions where it's well understood

1830
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:38,480
work sessions where it's well understood
 

1831
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,669
work sessions where it's well understood
uh like what dose to take

1832
00:30:41,669 --> 00:30:41,679
uh like what dose to take
 

1833
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:43,909
uh like what dose to take
like if i want to explore something

1834
00:30:43,909 --> 00:30:43,919
like if i want to explore something
 

1835
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:44,710
like if i want to explore something
where it's all

1836
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:44,720
where it's all
 

1837
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,149
where it's all
legal where it's all understood and safe

1838
00:30:48,149 --> 00:30:48,159
legal where it's all understood and safe
 

1839
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:49,430
legal where it's all understood and safe
all that kind of stuff how do we get

1840
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:49,440
all that kind of stuff how do we get
 

1841
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,190
all that kind of stuff how do we get
from uh

1842
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:51,200
from uh
 

1843
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,230
from uh
where we are today to there not speaking

1844
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:54,240
where we are today to there not speaking
 

1845
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,190
where we are today to there not speaking
in terms of legality in the sense like

1846
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:57,200
in terms of legality in the sense like
 

1847
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,269
in terms of legality in the sense like
policy making all that like laws and

1848
00:30:59,269 --> 00:30:59,279
policy making all that like laws and
 

1849
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:00,630
policy making all that like laws and
stuff meaning like

1850
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:00,640
stuff meaning like
 

1851
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,470
stuff meaning like
how do we scientifically understand this

1852
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:02,480
how do we scientifically understand this
 

1853
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,990
how do we scientifically understand this
stuff well enough

1854
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:04,000
stuff well enough
 

1855
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,310
stuff well enough
to get to a place where i can just take

1856
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:06,320
to get to a place where i can just take
 

1857
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,509
to get to a place where i can just take
it safely

1858
00:31:07,509 --> 00:31:07,519
it safely
 

1859
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:10,710
it safely
in order to expand my uh thinking

1860
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:10,720
in order to expand my uh thinking
 

1861
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,070
in order to expand my uh thinking
like this kind of first principles

1862
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:12,080
like this kind of first principles

like
 

1873
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:24,470
like
the only tools i have right now is just

1874
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:24,480
the only tools i have right now is just
 

1875
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,590
the only tools i have right now is just
just but my mind going doing the first

1876
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:27,600
just but my mind going doing the first
 

1877
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,710
just but my mind going doing the first
principles like

1878
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:28,720
principles like
 

1879
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,950
principles like
wait wait okay why has this been done

1880
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:30,960
wait wait okay why has this been done
 

1881
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,549
wait wait okay why has this been done
this way can we do it completely

1882
00:31:32,549 --> 00:31:32,559
this way can we do it completely
 

1883
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:33,669
this way can we do it completely
differently

1884
00:31:33,669 --> 00:31:33,679
differently
 

1885
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:36,870
differently
it seems like i'm still tethered to the

1886
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:36,880
it seems like i'm still tethered to the
 

1887
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,190
it seems like i'm still tethered to the
priors that i bring to the table and i

1888
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:39,200
priors that i bring to the table and i
 

1889
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,950
priors that i bring to the table and i
keep trying to untether myself maybe

1890
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:40,960
keep trying to untether myself maybe
 

1891
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,990
keep trying to untether myself maybe
there's tools

1892
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:42,000
there's tools
 

1893
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,590
there's tools
that can systematically help me on

1894
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:43,600
that can systematically help me on
 

1895
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,029
that can systematically help me on
tether yeah

1896
00:31:45,029 --> 00:31:45,039
tether yeah
 

1897
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:47,190
tether yeah
well we need experiments you know and

1898
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:47,200
well we need experiments you know and
 

1899
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,149
well we need experiments you know and
that's

1900
00:31:48,149 --> 00:31:48,159
that's
 

1901
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:50,710
that's
that's tied to kind of the policy level

1902
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:50,720
that's tied to kind of the policy level
 

1903
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,350
that's tied to kind of the policy level
stuff

1904
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:51,360
stuff
 

1905
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,269
stuff
um and i should be clear i would i'd

1906
00:31:53,269 --> 00:31:53,279
um and i should be clear i would i'd
 

1907
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,350
um and i should be clear i would i'd
never encourage anyone to do anything

1908
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:55,360
never encourage anyone to do anything
 

1909
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:59,990
never encourage anyone to do anything
um illicitly but yeah i you know uh in

1910
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:00,000
um illicitly but yeah i you know uh in
 

1911
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,750
um illicitly but yeah i you know uh in
the future we could see these

1912
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:01,760
the future we could see these
 

1913
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,389
the future we could see these
these you know compounds used for the

00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:09,440
what we need are
 

1921
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,830
what we need are
studies that are digging into that right

1922

studies that are digging into that right
 

1923
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,029

00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:20,000
what it's for
 

1933
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,110
what it's for
is is treatment of of mental disorders

1934
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:23,120
is is treatment of of mental disorders
 

1935
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,630
is is treatment of of mental disorders
like addiction and

1936

like addiction and
 

1937
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,149
like addiction and
depression etc um but we need studies

1938
00:32:28,149 --> 00:32:28,159
depression etc um but we need studies
 

1939
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:31,909
depression etc um but we need studies
you know one of the early initial stabs

1940
00:32:31,909 --> 00:32:31,919
you know one of the early initial stabs
 

1941
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:34,950
you know one of the early initial stabs
um on this question decades ago was they

1942
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:34,960
um on this question decades ago was they
 

1943
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,590
um on this question decades ago was they
took some

1944
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:35,600
took some
 

1945
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,710
took some
architects and engineers and said what

1946
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:38,720
architects and engineers and said what
 

1947
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,710
architects and engineers and said what
what problems have you been working on

1948
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:40,720
what problems have you been working on
 

1949
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,990
what problems have you been working on
where you've been stuck for

1950
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:42,000
where you've been stuck for
 

1951
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,509
where you've been stuck for
months like working on this damn thing

1952
00:32:43,509 --> 00:32:43,519
months like working on this damn thing
 

1953
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:45,110
months like working on this damn thing
and you're not getting anywhere like

1954
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:45,120
and you're not getting anywhere like
 

1955
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,190
and you're not getting anywhere like
your head's butting up against the wall

1956
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:47,200
your head's butting up against the wall
 

1957
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,269
your head's butting up against the wall
it's like come in here take and i think

1958
00:32:49,269 --> 00:32:49,279
it's like come in here take and i think
 

1959
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:51,430
it's like come in here take and i think
it was 100 micrograms of lsd so not a

1960
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:51,440
it was 100 micrograms of lsd so not a
 

1961
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,549
it was 100 micrograms of lsd so not a
big session

1962
00:32:52,549 --> 00:32:52,559
big session
 

1963
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,230
big session
and a little bit different model where

1964
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:54,240
and a little bit different model where
 

1965
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,350
and a little bit different model where
they were actually working it was a

1966
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:55,360
they were actually working it was a
 

1967
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,710
they were actually working it was a
moderate enough dose where they could

1968
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:56,720
moderate enough dose where they could
 

1969
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,789
moderate enough dose where they could
work on the problem during

1970
00:32:58,789 --> 00:32:58,799
work on the problem during
 

1971
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:03,430
work on the problem during
the session i think probably

1972
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:03,440
the session i think probably
 

1973
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,430
the session i think probably
i'm an empiricist so i'd like to see all

1974
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:05,440
i'm an empiricist so i'd like to see all
 

1975
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,630
i'm an empiricist so i'd like to see all
the studies done but

1976
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:06,640
the studies done but
 

1977
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,149
the studies done but
the first thing i would do is like a

1978
00:33:08,149 --> 00:33:08,159
the first thing i would do is like a
 

1979
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:09,509
the first thing i would do is like a
really high dose session where you're

1980
00:33:09,509 --> 00:33:09,519
really high dose session where you're
 

1981
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:10,470
really high dose session where you're
not necessarily

1982
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:10,480
not necessarily
 

1983
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,870
not necessarily
in front of your you know computer you

1984
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:12,880
in front of your you know computer you
 

1985
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,149
in front of your you know computer you
know which you can't really do

1986
00:33:14,149 --> 00:33:14,159
know which you can't really do
 

1987
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,549
know which you can't really do
on a on a really high dose and then the

1988
00:33:16,549 --> 00:33:16,559
on a on a really high dose and then the
 

1989
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:17,990
on a on a really high dose and then the
the work has

1990
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:18,000
the work has
 

1991
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,990
the work has
been talked about like you take a really

1992
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:20,000
been talked about like you take a really
 

1993
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,549
been talked about like you take a really
high dose you take a journey and then

1994
00:33:22,549 --> 00:33:22,559
high dose you take a journey and then
 

1995
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:24,630
high dose you take a journey and then
the breakthroughs come from when you

1996
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:24,640
the breakthroughs come from when you
 

1997
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,310
the breakthroughs come from when you
return from the journey and like

1998
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:26,320
return from the journey and like
 

1999
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,950
return from the journey and like
integrate quote unquote that experience

2000
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:28,960
integrate quote unquote that experience
 

2001
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,230
integrate quote unquote that experience
i think that's where the all the head

2002
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:30,240
i think that's where the all the head
 

2003
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,430
i think that's where the all the head
and we're again we're

2004
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:31,440
and we're again we're
 

2005
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,389
and we're again we're
we're babies at this point but my gut

2006
00:33:34,389 --> 00:33:34,399
we're babies at this point but my gut
 

2007
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:35,110
we're babies at this point but my gut
tells me

2008
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:35,120
tells me
 

2009
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,549
tells me
yeah that that it's the it's the

2010
00:33:36,549 --> 00:33:36,559
yeah that that it's the it's the
 

2011
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:38,230
yeah that that it's the it's the
so-called integration the aftermath we

2012
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:38,240
so-called integration the aftermath we
 

2013
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,029
so-called integration the aftermath we
know that there's some

2014
00:33:39,029 --> 00:33:39,039
know that there's some
 

2015
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:40,870
know that there's some
form different forms of neuroplasticity

2016
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:40,880
form different forms of neuroplasticity
 

2017
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,470
form different forms of neuroplasticity
that are unfolding in the days following

2018
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:42,480
that are unfolding in the days following
 

2019
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,710
that are unfolding in the days following
a psychedelic at least in animals

2020
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:44,720
a psychedelic at least in animals
 

2021
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,230
a psychedelic at least in animals
probably going on humans we don't know

2022
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:46,240
probably going on humans we don't know
 

2023
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,509
probably going on humans we don't know
if that's related to the therapeutic

2024
00:33:47,509 --> 00:33:47,519
if that's related to the therapeutic
 

2025
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:48,389
if that's related to the therapeutic
effects

2026
00:33:48,389 --> 00:33:48,399
effects
 

2027
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:51,110
effects
my my gut tells me it is although it's

2028
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:51,120
my my gut tells me it is although it's
 

2029
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,149
my my gut tells me it is although it's
it's only part of

2030
00:33:52,149 --> 00:33:52,159
it's only part of
 

2031
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:54,310
it's only part of
of the story but but we need big studies

2032
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:54,320
of the story but but we need big studies
 

2033
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,990
of the story but but we need big studies
where we compare people like let's get

2034
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:56,000
where we compare people like let's get
 

2035
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,590
where we compare people like let's get
100 people like that

2036
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:57,600
100 people like that
 

2037
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,230
100 people like that
scientists that are working on a problem

2038
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:00,240
scientists that are working on a problem
 

2039
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,669
scientists that are working on a problem
and then randomize them

2040
00:34:01,669 --> 00:34:01,679
and then randomize them
 

2041
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:04,310
and then randomize them
too and then i think you you need a uh

2042
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:04,320
too and then i think you you need a uh
 

2043
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:04,950
too and then i think you you need a uh
um

2044
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:04,960
um
 

2045
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,350
um
even more credible you know active

2046
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:07,360
even more credible you know active
 

2047
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,990
even more credible you know active
controls or active placebo conditions

2048
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:10,000
controls or active placebo conditions
 

2049
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,190
controls or active placebo conditions
to can kind of tease this out um

2050
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:13,200
to can kind of tease this out um
 

2051
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,710
to can kind of tease this out um
and then also in conjunction with that

2052
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:14,720
and then also in conjunction with that
 

2053
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,149
and then also in conjunction with that
and you can do this in the same study

2054
00:34:16,149 --> 00:34:16,159
and you can do this in the same study
 

2055
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:18,230
and you can do this in the same study
you want to combine that with

2056
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:18,240
you want to combine that with
 

2057
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,430
you want to combine that with
more rigorous sort of um

2058
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:21,440
more rigorous sort of um
 

2059
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,349
more rigorous sort of um
experimental models where we actually

2060
00:34:23,349 --> 00:34:23,359
experimental models where we actually
 

2061
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:25,270
experimental models where we actually
get their problem solving tasks that we

2062
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:25,280
get their problem solving tasks that we
 

2063
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,550
get their problem solving tasks that we
know for example that you

2064
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:26,560
know for example that you
 

2065
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,069
know for example that you
tend to do better on after you've gotten

2066
00:34:28,069 --> 00:34:28,079
tend to do better on after you've gotten
 

2067
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:29,990
tend to do better on after you've gotten
a good night's sleep versus not

2068
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:30,000
a good night's sleep versus not
 

2069
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,750
a good night's sleep versus not
and my my sense is there's a

2070
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:31,760
and my my sense is there's a
 

2071
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,349
and my my sense is there's a
relationship there

2072
00:34:33,349 --> 00:34:33,359
relationship there
 

2073
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:35,430
relationship there
you know people go back to first

2074
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:35,440
you know people go back to first
 

2075
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,190
you know people go back to first
principles you know questioning those

2076
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:37,200
principles you know questioning those
 

2077
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,109
principles you know questioning those
first principles they're operating under

2078
00:34:39,109 --> 00:34:39,119
first principles they're operating under
 

2079
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:42,470
first principles they're operating under
and um you know getting away from their

2080
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:42,480
and um you know getting away from their
 

2081
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,589
and um you know getting away from their
priors in terms of

2082
00:34:43,589 --> 00:34:43,599
priors in terms of
 

2083
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:46,230
priors in terms of
creative problem solving and so you i

2084
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:46,240
creative problem solving and so you i
 

2085
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,589
creative problem solving and so you i
think wrap those things and you could

2086
00:34:47,589 --> 00:34:47,599
think wrap those things and you could
 

2087
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:49,669
think wrap those things and you could
speak a little more rigorously about

2088
00:34:49,669 --> 00:34:49,679
speak a little more rigorously about
 

2089
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:50,869
speak a little more rigorously about
those because ultimately

2090
00:34:50,869 --> 00:34:50,879
those because ultimately
 

2091
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:52,629
those because ultimately
if everyone's bringing their own problem

2092
00:34:52,629 --> 00:34:52,639
if everyone's bringing their own problem
 

2093
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:53,909
if everyone's bringing their own problem
that's

2094
00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:53,919
that's
 

2095
00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:56,149
that's
that's i think that's more on the face

2096
00:34:56,149 --> 00:34:56,159
that's i think that's more on the face
 

2097
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,630
that's i think that's more on the face
valid side but you can't dig in as much

2098
00:34:58,630 --> 00:34:58,640
valid side but you can't dig in as much
 

2099
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,109
valid side but you can't dig in as much
and and get as much experimental power

2100
00:35:01,109 --> 00:35:01,119
and and get as much experimental power
 

2101
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:03,430
and and get as much experimental power
and speak to the mechanisms as you can

2102
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:03,440
and speak to the mechanisms as you can
 

2103
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,349
and speak to the mechanisms as you can
with having everyone do the same sort of

00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:11,280
about psychedelics generally is there
 

2111
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,310
about psychedelics generally is there
one you find

2112
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:12,320
one you find
 

2113
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,550
one you find
from the scientific perspective or maybe

2114
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:14,560
from the scientific perspective or maybe
 

2115
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,150

most fascinating to study

2118
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:18,400
most fascinating to study

therapeutically i'm most interested in

2120
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:20,800
therapeutically i'm most interested in
 

2121
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,870
therapeutically i'm most interested in
psilocybin and lsd and i think we need

2122
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:22,880
psilocybin and lsd and i think we need
 

2123
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,630
psilocybin and lsd and i think we need
to do a lot more with lsd because it's

2124
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:24,640
to do a lot more with lsd because it's
 

2125
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,870
to do a lot more with lsd because it's
mainly been psilocybin in the modern era

2126
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:26,880
mainly been psilocybin in the modern era
 

2127
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,630
mainly been psilocybin in the modern era
i've recently gotten a grant from the

00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:21,920
and it usually takes and this is a
 

2293
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,510
and it usually takes and this is a
pretty good kind of description of what

2294
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:23,520
pretty good kind of description of what
 

2295
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,109
pretty good kind of description of what
it might feel like on the ground

2296
00:38:25,109 --> 00:38:25,119
it might feel like on the ground
 

2297
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:28,950
it might feel like on the ground
um the caveat is it's it's

2298
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:28,960
um the caveat is it's it's
 

2299
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,230
um the caveat is it's it's
it's a completely insufficient

2300
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:30,240
it's a completely insufficient
 

2301
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,150
it's a completely insufficient
description and someone's going to be

2302
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:32,160
description and someone's going to be
 

2303
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,069
description and someone's going to be
listening who has done this it's like

2304
00:38:34,069 --> 00:38:34,079
listening who has done this it's like
 

2305
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:35,349
listening who has done this it's like
nothing you could say is going to come

2306
00:38:35,349 --> 00:38:35,359
nothing you could say is going to come
 

2307
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:35,990
nothing you could say is going to come
close

2308
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:36,000
close
 

2309
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,270
close
but it'll take about three big hits

2310
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:39,280
but it'll take about three big hits
 

2311
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,670
but it'll take about three big hits
inhalations in order to have what people

2312
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:41,680
inhalations in order to have what people
 

2313
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,829
inhalations in order to have what people
call a breakthrough dose

2314
00:38:44,829 --> 00:38:44,839
call a breakthrough dose
 

2315
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:47,510
call a breakthrough dose
um and there's no great definition of

2316
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:47,520
um and there's no great definition of
 

2317
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:47,910
um and there's no great definition of
that

2318
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:47,920
that
 

2319
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,150
that
but basically meaning moving away from

2320
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:52,160
but basically meaning moving away from
 

2321
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,550
but basically meaning moving away from
you know not just having the typical

2322
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:54,560
you know not just having the typical
 

2323
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,470
you know not just having the typical
psilocybin or lsd experience where

2324
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:56,480
psilocybin or lsd experience where
 

2325
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,230
psilocybin or lsd experience where
like things are radically different but

2326
00:38:58,230 --> 00:38:58,240
like things are radically different but
 

2327
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,990
like things are radically different but
you're still basically

2328
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:00,000
you're still basically
 

2329
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,710
you're still basically
a person in this reality to go in

2330
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:02,720
a person in this reality to go in
 

2331
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,550
a person in this reality to go in
somewhere else

2332
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:04,560
somewhere else
 

2333
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,230
somewhere else
and so that'll typically take like three

2334
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:06,240
and so that'll typically take like three
 

2335
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,030
and so that'll typically take like three
hits and this stuff comes on like a

2336
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:09,040
hits and this stuff comes on like a
 

2337
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,470
hits and this stuff comes on like a
freight train

2338
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:10,480
freight train
 

2339
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:14,230
freight train
so one takes a hit and around the time

2340
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:14,240
so one takes a hit and around the time
 

2341
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,990
so one takes a hit and around the time
of the first exhalation

2342
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:16,000
of the first exhalation
 

2343
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,069
of the first exhalation
so we're talking about a few seconds in

2344
00:39:18,069 --> 00:39:18,079
so we're talking about a few seconds in
 

2345
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:19,030
so we're talking about a few seconds in
or maybe just

2346
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:19,040
or maybe just
 

2347
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,790
or maybe just
you know sometime between the first and

2348
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:20,800
you know sometime between the first and
 

2349
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,150
you know sometime between the first and
the second hit

2350
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:22,160
the second hit
 

2351
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,190
the second hit
like it'll start to come on and they're

2352
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:25,200
like it'll start to come on and they're
 

2353
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,230
like it'll start to come on and they're
already up to

2354
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:26,240
already up to
 

2355
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,670
already up to
say um you know what they might get from

2356
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:29,680
say um you know what they might get from
 

2357
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,390
say um you know what they might get from
a 30

2358
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:30,400
a 30
 

2359
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:34,310
a 30
milligram or or 300 microgram lsd trip a

2360
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:34,320
milligram or or 300 microgram lsd trip a
 

2361
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,190
milligram or or 300 microgram lsd trip a
big trip

2362
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:35,200
big trip
 

2363
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,230
big trip
they're already there when at the second

2364
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:38,240
they're already there when at the second
 

2365
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,430
they're already there when at the second
hit but it's they're going their

2366
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:39,440
hit but it's they're going their
 

2367
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,430
hit but it's they're going their
consciousness is gear this is like

2368
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:41,440
consciousness is gear this is like
 

2369
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,829
consciousness is gear this is like
acceleration not speed to speak of

2370
00:39:43,829 --> 00:39:43,839
acceleration not speed to speak of
 

2371
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:45,349
acceleration not speed to speak of
physics okay it's like

2372
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:45,359
physics okay it's like
 

2373
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:46,790
physics okay it's like
you just those receptors are getting

2374
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:46,800
you just those receptors are getting
 

2375
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,550
you just those receptors are getting
filled like that and they're going from

2376
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:48,560
filled like that and they're going from
 

2377
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,630
filled like that and they're going from
zero to 60 in like you know tesla

2378
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:50,640
zero to 60 in like you know tesla
 

2379
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:54,550
zero to 60 in like you know tesla
time yeah and at the second hit again

2380
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:54,560
time yeah and at the second hit again
 

2381
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,710
time yeah and at the second hit again
they're at this maybe the strongest

2382
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:56,720
they're at this maybe the strongest
 

2383
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,950
they're at this maybe the strongest
psychedelic experience they've ever had

2384
00:39:58,950 --> 00:39:58,960
psychedelic experience they've ever had
 

2385
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,510
psychedelic experience they've ever had
and then if they can take that third hit

2386
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:01,520
and then if they can take that third hit
 

2387
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,150
and then if they can take that third hit
even some people can't

2388
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:04,160
even some people can't
 

2389
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,190
even some people can't
they're i mean they're

2390
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:07,200

 

2391
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,470

they're propelled into this other

2392
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:10,480
they're propelled into this other
 

2393
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,230
they're propelled into this other
reality and the nature of that other

2394
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:12,240
reality and the nature of that other
 

2395
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:12,870
reality and the nature of that other
reality

2396
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:12,880
reality
 

2397
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,190
reality
it will will differ depending on who you

2398
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:15,200
it will will differ depending on who you
 

2399
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,309
it will will differ depending on who you
ask but

2400
00:40:16,309 --> 00:40:16,319
ask but
 

2401
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:18,150
ask but
you know folks will talk often talk

2402
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:18,160
you know folks will talk often talk
 

2403
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,390
you know folks will talk often talk
about and and we've done some survey

2404
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:20,400
about and and we've done some survey
 

2405
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,150
about and and we've done some survey
research on this

2406
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:22,160
research on this
 

2407
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,750
research on this
entities of different types elves

2408
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:25,760
entities of different types elves
 

2409
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,109
entities of different types elves
tend to pop up yeah all the caveat is i

2410
00:40:29,109 --> 00:40:29,119
tend to pop up yeah all the caveat is i
 

2411
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:30,710
tend to pop up yeah all the caveat is i
i strongly presume all of this is

2412
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:30,720
i strongly presume all of this is
 

2413
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,790
i strongly presume all of this is
culturally influenced you know

2414
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:32,800
culturally influenced you know
 

2415
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,030
culturally influenced you know
but thinking more about the psychology

2416
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:35,040
but thinking more about the psychology
 

2417
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,550
but thinking more about the psychology
and the neuroscience

2418
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:36,560
and the neuroscience
 

2419
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,550
and the neuroscience
there is probably something fundamental

2420
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:38,560
there is probably something fundamental
 

2421
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,990
there is probably something fundamental
you know like

2422
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:40,000
you know like
 

2423
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,670
you know like
for someone that might be colored as

2424
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:41,680
for someone that might be colored as
 

2425
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,430
for someone that might be colored as
elves others it might be

2426
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:43,440
elves others it might be
 

2427
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,870
elves others it might be
colored as um terence mckenna called

2428
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:46,880
colored as um terence mckenna called
 

2429
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,710

them self dribbling basketballs

2430
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:48,720
them self dribbling basketballs
 

2431
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,470
them self dribbling basketballs
for someone else it might be little

2432
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:50,480
for someone else it might be little
 

2433
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,069
for someone else it might be little
animals or someone else it might be

aliens
 

2437
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,309
aliens
um i think that probably is dependent on

2438
00:40:56,309 --> 00:40:56,319
um i think that probably is dependent on
 

2439
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:57,349
um i think that probably is dependent on
who they are and what they've been

2440
00:40:57,349 --> 00:40:57,359
who they are and what they've been
 

2441
00:40:57,359 --> 00:40:59,589
who they are and what they've been
exposed to but just the fact that one

2442
00:40:59,589 --> 00:40:59,599
exposed to but just the fact that one
 

2443
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:02,950
exposed to but just the fact that one
has a sense that they're surrounded by

2444
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:02,960
has a sense that they're surrounded by
 

2445
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,349
has a sense that they're surrounded by
autonomous entities right intelligent

autonomous entities
 

2449
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,470
autonomous entities
right and people come back with stories

2450
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:08,480
right and people come back with stories
 

2451
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,470
right and people come back with stories
that are just

00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:10,480
that are just
 

2453
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,190
that are just
astonishing like there's communication

2454
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:13,200
astonishing like there's communication
 

2455
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:13,990
astonishing like there's communication
between these

2456
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:14,000
between these
 

2457
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,829
between these
entities and often they're telling them

2458
00:41:17,829 --> 00:41:17,839
entities and often they're telling them
 

2459
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:21,190
entities and often they're telling them
things that that that the person says

2460
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:21,200
things that that that the person says
 

2461
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,990
things that that that the person says
are self-validating but it seems like

2462
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:24,000
are self-validating but it seems like
 

2463
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,190
are self-validating but it seems like
it's impossible

2464
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:25,200
it's impossible
 

2465
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,750
it's impossible
like it really seems like and again this

2466
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:27,760
like it really seems like and again this
 

2467
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,270
like it really seems like and again this
is what people say

2468
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:29,280
is what people say
 

2469
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,550
is what people say
oftentimes that it's

2470
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:32,560
oftentimes that it's
 

2471
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,390
oftentimes that it's
it really is like downloading some

2472
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:34,400
it really is like downloading some
 

2473
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,470
it really is like downloading some
intelligence from a higher dimension or

2474
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:36,480
intelligence from a higher dimension or
 

2475
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,309
intelligence from a higher dimension or
some whatever metaphor

2476
00:41:38,309 --> 00:41:38,319
some whatever metaphor
 

2477
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:39,910
some whatever metaphor
you want to use sometimes these things

2478
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:39,920
you want to use sometimes these things
 

2479
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,510
you want to use sometimes these things
come up in dreams where it's like

2480
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:41,520
come up in dreams where it's like
 

2481
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,510
come up in dreams where it's like
someone is exposed to something that

2482
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:43,520
someone is exposed to something that
 

2483
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,990
someone is exposed to something that
i've had this in a dream you know where

2484
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:46,000
i've had this in a dream you know where
 

2485
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,670
i've had this in a dream you know where
it seems like what they are being

2486
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:47,680
it seems like what they are being
 

2487
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,309
it seems like what they are being
exposed to is

2488
00:41:50,309 --> 00:41:50,319
exposed to is
 

2489
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:52,309
exposed to is
physically impossible but yet at the

2490
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:52,319
physically impossible but yet at the
 

2491
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:54,150
physically impossible but yet at the
same time

2492
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:54,160
same time
 

2493
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,230
same time
self-validating it seems true like that

2494
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:56,240
self-validating it seems true like that
 

2495
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,670
self-validating it seems true like that
they really are figuring something out

2496
00:41:57,670 --> 00:41:57,680
they really are figuring something out
 

2497
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,950
they really are figuring something out
of course the challenge is to say

2498
00:41:58,950 --> 00:41:58,960
of course the challenge is to say
 

2499
00:41:58,960 --> 00:41:59,430
of course the challenge is to say
something

2500
00:41:59,430 --> 00:41:59,440
something
 

2501
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,910
something
in in concrete terms after the

2502
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:01,920
in in concrete terms after the
 

2503
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,430
in in concrete terms after the
experience that

2504
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:03,440
experience that
 

2505
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,309
experience that
where you could um you know verify that

2506
00:42:06,309 --> 00:42:06,319
where you could um you know verify that
 

2507
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:08,550
where you could um you know verify that
in any way and i i'm not familiar of any

2508
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:08,560
in any way and i i'm not familiar of any
 

2509
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,670
in any way and i i'm not familiar of any
examples of that well there's a there's

2510
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:11,680
examples of that well there's a there's
 

2511
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,589
examples of that well there's a there's
a sense in which

2512
00:42:13,589 --> 00:42:13,599
a sense in which
 

2513
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:18,150
a sense in which
i suppose the experience like um

2514
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:18,160

 

2515
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:21,670

you uh you're you're a limited cognitive

2516
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:21,680
you uh you're you're a limited cognitive
 

2517
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,589
you uh you're you're a limited cognitive
creature that knows very little about

2518
00:42:23,589 --> 00:42:23,599
creature that knows very little about
 

2519
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:24,230
creature that knows very little about
the world

2520
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:24,240
the world
 

2521
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,710
the world
and here's a chance to communicate with

2522
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:26,720
and here's a chance to communicate with
 

2523
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,910
and here's a chance to communicate with
much wiser

2524
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:27,920
much wiser
 

2525
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,109
much wiser
entities that in a way that you can't

2526
00:42:31,109 --> 00:42:31,119
entities that in a way that you can't
 

2527
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:32,150
entities that in a way that you can't
possibly understand

2528
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:32,160
possibly understand
 

2529
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:36,150
possibly understand
are trying to give you hints

2530
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:36,160
are trying to give you hints
 

2531
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:39,270
are trying to give you hints
of deeper truths right and so there's

2532
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:39,280
of deeper truths right and so there's
 

2533
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,390
of deeper truths right and so there's
that kind of sense

2534
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:40,400
that kind of sense
 

2535
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,309
that kind of sense
that you you can take something back but

2536
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:42,319
that you you can take something back but
 

2537
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:43,430
that you you can take something back but
you can't

2538
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:43,440
you can't
 

2539
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,550
you can't
where uh our cognition is not capable to

2540
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:46,560
where uh our cognition is not capable to
 

2541
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,230
where uh our cognition is not capable to
fully grasp the truth

2542
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:48,240
fully grasp the truth
 

2543
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,470
fully grasp the truth
we'll just get get a kind of sense of it

2544
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:50,480
we'll just get get a kind of sense of it
 

2545
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,510
we'll just get get a kind of sense of it
and somehow that

2546
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:51,520
and somehow that
 

2547
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,390
and somehow that
process is mind expanding that there's a

2548
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:54,400
process is mind expanding that there's a
 

2549
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,069
process is mind expanding that there's a
greater truth out there

2550
00:42:56,069 --> 00:42:56,079
greater truth out there
 

2551
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:59,109
greater truth out there
right that seems like what from the

2552
00:42:59,109 --> 00:42:59,119
right that seems like what from the
 

2553
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:00,069
right that seems like what from the
people i've heard

2554
00:43:00,069 --> 00:43:00,079
people i've heard
 

2555
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:02,630
people i've heard
talk about that's that seems to be what

2556
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:02,640
talk about that's that seems to be what
 

2557
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:03,589
talk about that's that seems to be what
uh

2558
00:43:03,589 --> 00:43:03,599
uh
 

2559
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:05,270
uh
it is and that's so fascinating that

2560
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:05,280
it is and that's so fascinating that
 

2561
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,109
it is and that's so fascinating that
there's um

2562
00:43:07,109 --> 00:43:07,119
there's um
 

2563
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:08,630
there's um
there's fundamentally to this whole

2564
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:08,640
there's fundamentally to this whole
 

2565
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,309
there's fundamentally to this whole
thing is the communication between

2566
00:43:10,309 --> 00:43:10,319
thing is the communication between
 

2567
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:13,510
thing is the communication between
an entity that is other than yourself

2568
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:13,520
an entity that is other than yourself
 

2569
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,710
an entity that is other than yourself
entities so it's not just like a visual

2570
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:16,720
entities so it's not just like a visual
 

2571
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:17,670
entities so it's not just like a visual
experience

2572
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:17,680
experience
 

2573
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,990
experience
like uh like you're like floating

2574
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:20,000
like uh like you're like floating
 

2575
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:20,950
like uh like you're like floating
through the world

2576
00:43:20,950 --> 00:43:20,960
through the world
 

2577
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:23,510
through the world
is there's other beings there which is

2578
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:23,520
is there's other beings there which is
 

2579
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,349
is there's other beings there which is
kind of

2580
00:43:25,349 --> 00:43:25,359
kind of
 

2581
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:26,950
kind of
i don't know i don't know what to sort

2582
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:26,960
i don't know i don't know what to sort
 

2583
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,870
i don't know i don't know what to sort
of uh from a person who

2584
00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:28,880
of uh from a person who
 

2585
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,870
of uh from a person who
likes freud and carl jung i don't know

2586
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:30,880
likes freud and carl jung i don't know
 

2587
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,069
likes freud and carl jung i don't know
what to think about that

2588
00:43:32,069 --> 00:43:32,079
what to think about that
 

2589
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:33,829
what to think about that
that being of course from one

2590
00:43:33,829 --> 00:43:33,839
that being of course from one
 

2591
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:35,349
that being of course from one
perspective it's just you looking in the

2592
00:43:35,349 --> 00:43:35,359
perspective it's just you looking in the
 

2593
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:36,550
perspective it's just you looking in the
mirror

2594
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:36,560
mirror
 

2595
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,230
mirror
but it could also be from another

2596
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:38,240
but it could also be from another
 

2597
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,990
but it could also be from another
perspective like actually

2598
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:40,000
perspective like actually
 

2599
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,390
perspective like actually
talking to other beings yeah you

2600
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:42,400
talking to other beings yeah you
 

2601
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,309
talking to other beings yeah you
mentioned young and i think that's

2602
00:43:44,309 --> 00:43:44,319
mentioned young and i think that's
 

2603
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:45,829
mentioned young and i think that's
he's particularly interesting and it

2604
00:43:45,829 --> 00:43:45,839
he's particularly interesting and it
 

2605
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:47,990
he's particularly interesting and it
kind of points to something i was

2606
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:48,000
kind of points to something i was
 

2607
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,750
kind of points to something i was
you know thinking about saying is that

2608
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:49,760
you know thinking about saying is that
 

2609
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,829
you know thinking about saying is that
that i think what might be going on

2610
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:51,839
that i think what might be going on
 

2611
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:52,390
that i think what might be going on
natural

2612
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:52,400
natural
 

2613
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:55,349
natural
from a naturalistic perspective um so

2614
00:43:55,349 --> 00:43:55,359
from a naturalistic perspective um so
 

2615
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:56,390
from a naturalistic perspective um so
regardless

2616
00:43:56,390 --> 00:43:56,400
regardless
 

2617
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,309
regardless
you know whether or not there are you

2618
00:43:58,309 --> 00:43:58,319
you know whether or not there are you
 

2619
00:43:58,319 --> 00:43:59,750
you know whether or not there are you
know it doesn't depend on

2620
00:43:59,750 --> 00:43:59,760
know it doesn't depend on
 

2621
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,910
know it doesn't depend on
autonomous entities out there what might

2622
00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:01,920
autonomous entities out there what might
 

2623
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,430
autonomous entities out there what might
be happening

2624
00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:03,440
be happening
 

2625
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:07,589
be happening
is that just the associative net

2626
00:44:07,589 --> 00:44:07,599
is that just the associative net
 

2627
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:12,309
is that just the associative net
the the the level of learning the

2628
00:44:12,309 --> 00:44:12,319

 

2629
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:15,910

the comprehension might be so

2630
00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:15,920
the comprehension might be so
 

2631
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,309
the comprehension might be so
beyond what someone is is used to that

2632
00:44:18,309 --> 00:44:18,319
beyond what someone is is used to that
 

2633
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:20,150
beyond what someone is is used to that
the only way

2634
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:20,160
the only way
 

2635
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:23,109
the only way
for the nervous system for for the for

2636
00:44:23,109 --> 00:44:23,119
for the nervous system for for the for
 

2637
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:24,309
for the nervous system for for the for
the aware

2638
00:44:24,309 --> 00:44:24,319
the aware
 

2639
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:26,950
the aware
sense of self to orient towards it is

2640
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:26,960
sense of self to orient towards it is
 

2641
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,470
sense of self to orient towards it is
all by metaphor

2642
00:44:28,470 --> 00:44:28,480
all by metaphor
 

2643
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,470
all by metaphor
and so i do think you know when we get

2644
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:30,480
and so i do think you know when we get
 

2645
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:31,750
and so i do think you know when we get
into these realms

2646
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:31,760
into these realms
 

2647
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:34,710
into these realms
as as a strong empiricist i think we

2648
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:34,720
as as a strong empiricist i think we
 

2649
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,309
as as a strong empiricist i think we
always got to be careful and be as

2650
00:44:36,309 --> 00:44:36,319
always got to be careful and be as
 

2651
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:38,870
always got to be careful and be as
grounded as possible but i'm also

2652
00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:38,880
grounded as possible but i'm also
 

2653
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,870
grounded as possible but i'm also
willing to speculate and and sort of

2654
00:44:40,870 --> 00:44:40,880
willing to speculate and and sort of
 

2655
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,150
willing to speculate and and sort of
cast the nets wide

2656
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:42,160
cast the nets wide
 

2657
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,069
cast the nets wide
with caveat but you know i think of

2658
00:44:44,069 --> 00:44:44,079
with caveat but you know i think of
 

2659
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:45,430
with caveat but you know i think of
things like archetypes

2660
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:45,440
things like archetypes
 

2661
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,990
things like archetypes
and you know you know it's plausible

2662
00:44:47,990 --> 00:44:48,000
and you know you know it's plausible
 

2663
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,829
and you know you know it's plausible
that there are certain stories there are

2664
00:44:49,829 --> 00:44:49,839
that there are certain stories there are
 

2665
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:50,309
that there are certain stories there are
certain

2666
00:44:50,309 --> 00:44:50,319
certain
 

2667
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:52,470
certain
you know we've gone through millions of

2668
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:52,480
you know we've gone through millions of
 

2669
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:53,670
you know we've gone through millions of
years of evolution

2670
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:53,680
years of evolution
 

2671
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:57,270
years of evolution
it may be that we have certain um

2672
00:44:57,270 --> 00:44:57,280
it may be that we have certain um
 

2673
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:00,390
it may be that we have certain um
characters and stories that are sort of

2674
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:00,400
characters and stories that are sort of
 

2675
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,030
characters and stories that are sort of
that our central nervous system are sort

2676
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:03,040
that our central nervous system are sort
 

2677
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,790
that our central nervous system are sort
of wired to tend to

2678
00:45:04,790 --> 00:45:04,800
of wired to tend to
 

2679
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,470
of wired to tend to
yeah those stories that we carry those

2680
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:06,480
yeah those stories that we carry those
 

2681
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,630
yeah those stories that we carry those
stories in us right and this unlocks

2682
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:08,640
stories in us right and this unlocks
 

2683
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,309
stories in us right and this unlocks
them in a certain kind of way

2684
00:45:10,309 --> 00:45:10,319
them in a certain kind of way
 

2685
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:12,069
them in a certain kind of way
and we think about stories like our

2686
00:45:12,069 --> 00:45:12,079
and we think about stories like our
 

2687
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:13,670
and we think about stories like our
sense of self is basically narrative

2688
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:13,680
sense of self is basically narrative
 

2689
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:14,950
sense of self is basically narrative
self is a story

2690
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:14,960
self is a story
 

2691
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:18,550
self is a story
and we think about the world of stories

2692
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:18,560
and we think about the world of stories
 

2693
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:19,990
and we think about the world of stories
this is why metaphors are always more

2694
00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:20,000
this is why metaphors are always more
 

2695
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,430
this is why metaphors are always more
powerful than

2696
00:45:21,430 --> 00:45:21,440
powerful than
 

2697
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,829
powerful than
um you know sort of laying out all the

2698
00:45:23,829 --> 00:45:23,839
um you know sort of laying out all the
 

2699
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:25,430
um you know sort of laying out all the
details all the time you know

2700
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:25,440
details all the time you know
 

2701
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,190
details all the time you know
speaking in parables it's like if you

2702
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:27,200
speaking in parables it's like if you
 

2703
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,589
speaking in parables it's like if you
really get so you know this is why

2704
00:45:29,589 --> 00:45:29,599
really get so you know this is why
 

2705
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:31,510
really get so you know this is why
as much as i hate it you know if you're

2706
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:31,520
as much as i hate it you know if you're
 

2707
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,270
as much as i hate it you know if you're
presenting to congress or something and

2708
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:33,280
presenting to congress or something and
 

2709
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,150
presenting to congress or something and
you have all the

2710
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:34,160
you have all the
 

2711
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:37,349
you have all the
the best data in the world it's not as

2712
00:45:37,349 --> 00:45:37,359
the best data in the world it's not as
 

2713
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:40,309
the best data in the world it's not as
powerful as that one anecdote as

2714
00:45:40,309 --> 00:45:40,319
powerful as that one anecdote as
 

2715
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:43,190
powerful as that one anecdote as
as as the mom dying of cancer that had

2716
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:43,200
as as the mom dying of cancer that had
 

2717
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:44,470
as as the mom dying of cancer that had
the psilocybin session

2718
00:45:44,470 --> 00:45:44,480
the psilocybin session
 

2719
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,390
the psilocybin session
and it transformed her life you know

2720
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:46,400
and it transformed her life you know
 

2721
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,510
and it transformed her life you know
that's a story

2722
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:47,520
that's a story
 

2723
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,829
that's a story
that's meaningful and so when this kind

2724
00:45:49,829 --> 00:45:49,839
that's meaningful and so when this kind
 

2725
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:50,950
that's meaningful and so when this kind
of

2726
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:50,960
of
 

2727
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:53,990
of
unimaginable kind of change and

2728
00:45:53,990 --> 00:45:54,000
unimaginable kind of change and
 

2729
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,030
unimaginable kind of change and
and and experience happens with a

2730
00:45:57,030 --> 00:45:57,040
and and experience happens with a
 

2731
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:00,630
and and experience happens with a
dmt um ingestion

2732
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:00,640
dmt um ingestion
 

2733
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:03,349
dmt um ingestion
it these stories of entities they might

2734
00:46:03,349 --> 00:46:03,359
it these stories of entities they might
 

2735
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:04,710
it these stories of entities they might
they might be that you know

2736
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:04,720
they might be that you know
 

2737
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,349
they might be that you know
stories that are constructed that is the

2738
00:46:07,349 --> 00:46:07,359
stories that are constructed that is the
 

2739
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:08,150
stories that are constructed that is the
the closest

2740
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:08,160
the closest
 

2741
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,510
the closest
which is not to say the stories aren't

2742
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:09,520
which is not to say the stories aren't
 

2743
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:10,630
which is not to say the stories aren't
real i mean i think we're getting to

2744
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:10,640
real i mean i think we're getting to
 

2745
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,630
real i mean i think we're getting to
layers where

2746
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:12,640
layers where
 

2747
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:16,390
layers where
what it doesn't yeah yeah but it's the

2748
00:46:16,390 --> 00:46:16,400
what it doesn't yeah yeah but it's the
 

2749
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,750
what it doesn't yeah yeah but it's the
closest we can come

2750
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:17,760
closest we can come
 

2751
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,829
closest we can come
to making sense out of it because i do

2752
00:46:19,829 --> 00:46:19,839
to making sense out of it because i do
 

2753
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:20,870
to making sense out of it because i do
what we do know

2754
00:46:20,870 --> 00:46:20,880
what we do know
 

2755
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,630
what we do know
about these psychedelics one of the

2756
00:46:22,630 --> 00:46:22,640
about these psychedelics one of the
 

2757
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,390
about these psychedelics one of the
levels beyond the receptor is that the

2758
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:24,400
levels beyond the receptor is that the
 

2759
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,390
levels beyond the receptor is that the
brain is communicating it with itself in

2760
00:46:26,390 --> 00:46:26,400
brain is communicating it with itself in
 

2761
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,230
brain is communicating it with itself in
a massively different way

2762
00:46:28,230 --> 00:46:28,240
a massively different way
 

2763
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,309
a massively different way
there's massive communication with areas

2764
00:46:30,309 --> 00:46:30,319
there's massive communication with areas
 

2765
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:32,390
there's massive communication with areas
that don't normally communicate

2766
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:32,400
that don't normally communicate
 

2767
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:36,470
that don't normally communicate
and so it i think that comes with

2768
00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:36,480
and so it i think that comes with
 

2769
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,030
and so it i think that comes with
both it's casting the nets wide i think

2770
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:39,040
both it's casting the nets wide i think
 

2771
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,870
both it's casting the nets wide i think
that comes with the insights

2772
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:40,880
that comes with the insights
 

2773
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,870
that comes with the insights
and helpful novel ways of thinking i do

2774
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:42,880
and helpful novel ways of thinking i do
 

2775
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:43,910
and helpful novel ways of thinking i do
think it comes with

2776
00:46:43,910 --> 00:46:43,920
think it comes with
 

2777

00:54:59,829 --> 00:54:59,839
um to non-economic behavior
 

3259
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:01,750
um to non-economic behavior
so basically at one point uh like

3260
00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:01,760
so basically at one point uh like
 

3261
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:04,069
so basically at one point uh like
psychologists figured out that

3262
00:55:04,069 --> 00:55:04,079
psychologists figured out that
 

3263
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:05,349
psychologists figured out that
there's this whole other discipline

3264
00:55:05,349 --> 00:55:05,359
there's this whole other discipline
 

3265
00:55:05,359 --> 00:55:06,870
there's this whole other discipline
that's been studying behavior just

3266
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:06,880
that's been studying behavior just
 

3267
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,390
that's been studying behavior just
happened to be all focused on

3268
00:55:08,390 --> 00:55:08,400
happened to be all focused on
 

3269
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,950
happened to be all focused on
monetary behavior spending and saving

3270
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:10,960
monetary behavior spending and saving
 

3271
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,230
monetary behavior spending and saving
money etc

3272
00:55:12,230 --> 00:55:12,240
money etc
 

3273
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,910
money etc
but it comes with all of these like

3274
00:55:13,910 --> 00:55:13,920
but it comes with all of these like
 

3275
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:15,750
but it comes with all of these like
principles that can be wildly

3276
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:15,760
principles that can be wildly
 

3277
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:17,750
principles that can be wildly
and and fruitfully applied to

3278
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:17,760
and and fruitfully applied to
 

3279
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,430
and and fruitfully applied to
understanding behavior so

3280
00:55:19,430 --> 00:55:19,440
understanding behavior so
 

3281
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:21,270
understanding behavior so
so for example i've studied things like

3282
00:55:21,270 --> 00:55:21,280
so for example i've studied things like
 

3283
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:22,549
so for example i've studied things like
um

3284
00:55:22,549 --> 00:55:22,559
um
 

3285
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:24,230
um
demand curve analysis of drug

3286
00:55:24,230 --> 00:55:24,240
demand curve analysis of drug
 

3287
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:27,349
demand curve analysis of drug
consumption so i look at um

3288
00:55:27,349 --> 00:55:27,359
consumption so i look at um
 

3289
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:30,309
consumption so i look at um
for example the the tobacco cigarettes

3290
00:55:30,309 --> 00:55:30,319
for example the the tobacco cigarettes
 

3291
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:31,910
for example the the tobacco cigarettes
and nicotine products through the lens

3292
00:55:31,910 --> 00:55:31,920
and nicotine products through the lens
 

3293
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:32,470
and nicotine products through the lens
of

3294
00:55:32,470 --> 00:55:32,480
of
 

3295
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:36,150
of
of of demand curves and

3296
00:55:36,150 --> 00:55:36,160
of of demand curves and
 

3297
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:38,549
of of demand curves and
in other words at different prices if

3298
00:55:38,549 --> 00:55:38,559
in other words at different prices if
 

3299
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:40,630
in other words at different prices if
there's different work requirements

3300
00:55:40,630 --> 00:55:40,640
there's different work requirements
 

3301
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:43,349
there's different work requirements
for um being able to smoke cigarettes

3302
00:55:43,349 --> 00:55:43,359
for um being able to smoke cigarettes
 

3303
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:44,710
for um being able to smoke cigarettes
sort of modeling

3304
00:55:44,710 --> 00:55:44,720
sort of modeling
 

3305
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:47,430
sort of modeling
price within that price data there is

3306
00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:47,440
price within that price data there is
 

3307
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:48,069
price within that price data there is
some

3308
00:55:48,069 --> 00:55:48,079
some
 

3309
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:50,870
some
indication of addiction how much you the

3310
00:55:50,870 --> 00:55:50,880
indication of addiction how much you the
 

3311
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,390
indication of addiction how much you the
habits that you form around these

3312
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:52,400
habits that you form around these
 

3313
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:53,030
habits that you form around these
particular

3314
00:55:53,030 --> 00:55:53,040
particular
 

3315
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:56,150
particular
uh yeah it's one one important dimension

3316
00:55:56,150 --> 00:55:56,160
uh yeah it's one one important dimension
 

3317
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:57,670
uh yeah it's one one important dimension
so i think a particularly important one

3318
00:55:57,670 --> 00:55:57,680
so i think a particularly important one
 

3319
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:00,309
so i think a particularly important one
there is elasticity or inelasticity

3320
00:56:00,309 --> 00:56:00,319
there is elasticity or inelasticity
 

3321
00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:02,870
there is elasticity or inelasticity
you know um two ends of the spectrum so

3322
00:56:02,870 --> 00:56:02,880
you know um two ends of the spectrum so
 

3323
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:05,190
you know um two ends of the spectrum so
that's the the price sensitivity

3324
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:05,200
that's the the price sensitivity
 

3325
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,270
that's the the price sensitivity
so so for example you could have

3326
00:56:07,270 --> 00:56:07,280
so so for example you could have
 

3327
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:08,309
so so for example you could have
something that's pretty

3328
00:56:08,309 --> 00:56:08,319
something that's pretty
 

3329
00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:11,750
something that's pretty
price um uh inelastic

3330
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:11,760
price um uh inelastic
 

3331
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:15,510
price um uh inelastic
like like gasoline so the price of gas

3332
00:56:15,510 --> 00:56:15,520
like like gasoline so the price of gas
 

3333
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:17,349
like like gasoline so the price of gas
at times can keep going up and americans

3334
00:56:17,349 --> 00:56:17,359
at times can keep going up and americans
 

3335
00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:18,789
at times can keep going up and americans
are just going to

3336
00:56:18,789 --> 00:56:18,799
are just going to
 

3337
00:56:18,799 --> 00:56:21,030
are just going to
pretty much you know buy the same amount

3338
00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:21,040
pretty much you know buy the same amount
 

3339
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:23,190
pretty much you know buy the same amount
of gas or maybe you know the price of

3340
00:56:23,190 --> 00:56:23,200
of gas or maybe you know the price of
 

3341
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,950
of gas or maybe you know the price of
gas doubles but their consumption only

3342
00:56:24,950 --> 00:56:24,960
gas doubles but their consumption only
 

3343
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:26,950
gas doubles but their consumption only
decreases by 10 percent so it's a

3344
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:26,960
decreases by 10 percent so it's a
 

3345
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:28,950
decreases by 10 percent so it's a
subproportional reduction so that's

3346
00:56:28,950 --> 00:56:28,960
subproportional reduction so that's
 

3347
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:31,430
subproportional reduction so that's
an inelastic and and and that changes

3348
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:31,440
an inelastic and and and that changes
 

3349
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:33,109
an inelastic and and and that changes
like you push the price up high enough i

3350
00:56:33,109 --> 00:56:33,119
like you push the price up high enough i
 

3351
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:33,990
like you push the price up high enough i
mean if it was 100

3352
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:34,000
mean if it was 100
 

3353
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,829
mean if it was 100
a gallon it would eventually turn the

3354
00:56:35,829 --> 00:56:35,839
a gallon it would eventually turn the
 

3355
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:37,349
a gallon it would eventually turn the
curve would turn um

3356
00:56:37,349 --> 00:56:37,359
curve would turn um
 

3357
00:56:37,359 --> 00:56:38,950
curve would turn um
and and go downward more more

3358
00:56:38,950 --> 00:56:38,960
and and go downward more more
 

3359
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:40,549
and and go downward more more
drastically and it would be

3360
00:56:40,549 --> 00:56:40,559
drastically and it would be
 

3361
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:43,270
drastically and it would be
elastic but you can apply that to

3362
00:56:43,270 --> 00:56:43,280
elastic but you can apply that to
 

3363
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:44,789
elastic but you can apply that to
someone you know someone who

3364
00:56:44,789 --> 00:56:44,799
someone you know someone who
 

3365
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:48,390
someone you know someone who
a regular cigarette smoker who um

3366
00:56:48,390 --> 00:56:48,400
a regular cigarette smoker who um
 

3367
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,549
a regular cigarette smoker who um
who is working for cigarette puffs who

3368
00:56:50,549 --> 00:56:50,559
who is working for cigarette puffs who
 

3369
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:52,470
who is working for cigarette puffs who
has who's gone six hours without smoking

3370
00:56:52,470 --> 00:56:52,480
has who's gone six hours without smoking
 

3371
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,309
has who's gone six hours without smoking
and you're asking questions like

3372
00:56:54,309 --> 00:56:54,319
and you're asking questions like
 

3373
00:56:54,319 --> 00:56:55,589
and you're asking questions like
you know how many times are they willing

3374
00:56:55,589 --> 00:56:55,599
you know how many times are they willing
 

3375
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:57,510
you know how many times are they willing
to pull this knob

3376
00:56:57,510 --> 00:56:57,520
to pull this knob
 

3377
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:58,789
to pull this knob
in the lab during this three-hour

3378
00:56:58,789 --> 00:56:58,799
in the lab during this three-hour
 

3379
00:56:58,799 --> 00:57:00,870
in the lab during this three-hour
session i do a lot of work like this

3380
00:57:00,870 --> 00:57:00,880
session i do a lot of work like this
 

3381
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,549
session i do a lot of work like this
in order to earn a cigarette how does

3382
00:57:02,549 --> 00:57:02,559
in order to earn a cigarette how does
 

3383
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:04,390
in order to earn a cigarette how does
the how does the content of nicotine in

3384
00:57:04,390 --> 00:57:04,400
the how does the content of nicotine in
 

3385
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:04,870
the how does the content of nicotine in
that

3386
00:57:04,870 --> 00:57:04,880
that
 

3387
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:06,789
that
effect it has the availability of

3388
00:57:06,789 --> 00:57:06,799
effect it has the availability of
 

3389
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:08,309
effect it has the availability of
nicotine replacement products like

3390
00:57:08,309 --> 00:57:08,319
nicotine replacement products like
 

3391
00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:09,430
nicotine replacement products like
nicotine gum or

3392
00:57:09,430 --> 00:57:09,440
nicotine gum or
 

3393
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:11,750
nicotine gum or
e-cigarettes affect those those

3394
00:57:11,750 --> 00:57:11,760
e-cigarettes affect those those
 

3395
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:13,910
e-cigarettes affect those those
decisions so you can it's a certain lens

3396
00:57:13,910 --> 00:57:13,920
decisions so you can it's a certain lens
 

3397
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:14,150
decisions so you can it's a certain lens
of

3398
00:57:14,150 --> 00:57:14,160
of
 

3399
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:15,750
of
it's sort of a way to take the kind of

3400
00:57:15,750 --> 00:57:15,760
it's sort of a way to take the kind of
 

3401
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:17,190
it's sort of a way to take the kind of
the classic

3402
00:57:17,190 --> 00:57:17,200
the classic
 

3403
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,750
the classic
behavioral psychology definition of

3404
00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:19,760
behavioral psychology definition of
 

3405
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:21,349
behavioral psychology definition of
reinforcement

3406
00:57:21,349 --> 00:57:21,359
reinforcement
 

3407
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:23,990
reinforcement
and which is just basically reward you

3408
00:57:23,990 --> 00:57:24,000
and which is just basically reward you
 

3409
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,430
and which is just basically reward you
know how much is this a good thing and

3410
00:57:25,430 --> 00:57:25,440
know how much is this a good thing and
 

3411
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:27,510
know how much is this a good thing and
it kind of breaks that apart into

3412
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:27,520
it kind of breaks that apart into
 

3413
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:30,950
it kind of breaks that apart into
a multi-dimensional um space

3414
00:57:30,950 --> 00:57:30,960
a multi-dimensional um space
 

3415
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:33,670
a multi-dimensional um space
so it's not just the ideas reward or

3416
00:57:33,670 --> 00:57:33,680
so it's not just the ideas reward or
 

3417
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:35,990
so it's not just the ideas reward or
reinforcement is not unidimensional

3418
00:57:35,990 --> 00:57:36,000
reinforcement is not unidimensional
 

3419
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,069
reinforcement is not unidimensional
so for example you can unpack that with

3420
00:57:38,069 --> 00:57:38,079
so for example you can unpack that with
 

3421
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:39,349
so for example you can unpack that with
demand curves

3422
00:57:39,349 --> 00:57:39,359
demand curves
 

3423
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:42,230
demand curves
at a cheap price you might prefer one

3424
00:57:42,230 --> 00:57:42,240
at a cheap price you might prefer one
 

3425
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:43,670
at a cheap price you might prefer one
good to another

3426
00:57:43,670 --> 00:57:43,680
good to another
 

3427
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,349
good to another
you know so the classic example is

3428
00:57:45,349 --> 00:57:45,359
you know so the classic example is
 

3429
00:57:45,359 --> 00:57:47,510
you know so the classic example is
luxury versus necessity so diamonds

3430
00:57:47,510 --> 00:57:47,520
luxury versus necessity so diamonds
 

3431
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:49,430
luxury versus necessity so diamonds
versus toilet paper

3432
00:57:49,430 --> 00:57:49,440
versus toilet paper
 

3433
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:51,750
versus toilet paper
so at those cheap prices you can look at

3434
00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:51,760
so at those cheap prices you can look at
 

3435
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,670
so at those cheap prices you can look at
something called intensity of demand

3436
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:53,680
something called intensity of demand
 

3437
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:55,349
something called intensity of demand
you know if it was basically as cheap as

3438
00:57:55,349 --> 00:57:55,359
you know if it was basically as cheap as
 

3439
00:57:55,359 --> 00:57:57,670
you know if it was basically as cheap as
possible or essentially zero

3440
00:57:57,670 --> 00:57:57,680
possible or essentially zero
 

3441
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:59,910
possible or essentially zero
how much would you buy of this good but

3442
00:57:59,910 --> 00:57:59,920
how much would you buy of this good but
 

3443
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:01,589
how much would you buy of this good but
then you keep jacking up the price

3444
00:58:01,589 --> 00:58:01,599
then you keep jacking up the price
 

3445
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:04,470
then you keep jacking up the price
and you'll see so diamonds will look

3446
00:58:04,470 --> 00:58:04,480
and you'll see so diamonds will look
 

3447
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:05,349
and you'll see so diamonds will look
like the better

3448
00:58:05,349 --> 00:58:05,359
like the better
 

3449
00:58:05,359 --> 00:58:07,829
like the better
reward at that at that low price of

3450
00:58:07,829 --> 00:58:07,839
reward at that at that low price of
 

3451
00:58:07,839 --> 00:58:09,190
reward at that at that low price of
intensity demand

3452
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:09,200
intensity demand
 

3453
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:10,710
intensity demand
side of things but as you keep jacking

3454
00:58:10,710 --> 00:58:10,720
side of things but as you keep jacking
 

3455
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,230
side of things but as you keep jacking
up the price you got to have some toilet

3456
00:58:12,230 --> 00:58:12,240
up the price you got to have some toilet
 

3457
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:12,710
up the price you got to have some toilet
paper

3458
00:58:12,710 --> 00:58:12,720
paper
 

3459
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:14,950
paper
yes okay we can get into the whole like

3460
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:14,960
yes okay we can get into the whole like
 

3461
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,630
yes okay we can get into the whole like
bidet thing but forget that you know

3462
00:58:16,630 --> 00:58:16,640
bidet thing but forget that you know
 

3463
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:17,270
bidet thing but forget that you know
like

3464
00:58:17,270 --> 00:58:17,280
like
 

3465
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:19,670
like
uh i know joe's been pushing that too

3466
00:58:19,670 --> 00:58:19,680
uh i know joe's been pushing that too
 

3467
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:20,549
uh i know joe's been pushing that too
but

3468
00:58:20,549 --> 00:58:20,559
but
 

3469
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:22,309
but
you know you're gonna you're gonna hang

3470
00:58:22,309 --> 00:58:22,319
you know you're gonna you're gonna hang
 

3471
00:58:22,319 --> 00:58:24,150
you know you're gonna you're gonna hang
on and keep buying the toilet paper to a

3472
00:58:24,150 --> 00:58:24,160
on and keep buying the toilet paper to a
 

3473
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:24,710
on and keep buying the toilet paper to a
greater

3474
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:24,720
greater
 

3475
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:26,630
greater
degree than you will the diamonds yes so

3476
00:58:26,630 --> 00:58:26,640
degree than you will the diamonds yes so
 

3477
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:28,789
degree than you will the diamonds yes so
you'll see a crossing of demand curves

3478
00:58:28,789 --> 00:58:28,799
you'll see a crossing of demand curves
 

3479
00:58:28,799 --> 00:58:30,870
you'll see a crossing of demand curves
so what's the better reinforcer what's

3480
00:58:30,870 --> 00:58:30,880
so what's the better reinforcer what's
 

3481
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:32,950
so what's the better reinforcer what's
the better reward depends on your price

3482
00:58:32,950 --> 00:58:32,960
the better reward depends on your price
 

3483
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:34,950
the better reward depends on your price
you know and so that's one that's an

3484
00:58:34,950 --> 00:58:34,960
you know and so that's one that's an
 

3485
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:36,150
you know and so that's one that's an
example of one way

3486
00:58:36,150 --> 00:58:36,160
example of one way
 

3487
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:40,230
example of one way
to and that a of look at addiction so

3488
00:58:40,230 --> 00:58:40,240
to and that a of look at addiction so
 

3489
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:42,230
to and that a of look at addiction so
specifically drug consumption which is

3490
00:58:42,230 --> 00:58:42,240
specifically drug consumption which is
 

3491
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:45,030
specifically drug consumption which is
isn't all of addiction but it's like

3492
00:58:45,030 --> 00:58:45,040
isn't all of addiction but it's like
 

3493
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:46,390
isn't all of addiction but it's like
in order for something to be addictive

3494
00:58:46,390 --> 00:58:46,400
in order for something to be addictive
 

3495
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:48,710
in order for something to be addictive
it has to be a a reward

3496
00:58:48,710 --> 00:58:48,720
it has to be a a reward
 

3497
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:51,990
it has to be a a reward
and it has to compete with

3498
00:58:51,990 --> 00:58:52,000
and it has to compete with
 

3499
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,789
and it has to compete with
other rewards in in your life and and

3500
00:58:54,789 --> 00:58:54,799
other rewards in in your life and and
 

3501
00:58:54,799 --> 00:58:57,430
other rewards in in your life and and
one of the two main aspects of addiction

3502
00:58:57,430 --> 00:58:57,440
one of the two main aspects of addiction
 

3503
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:00,069
one of the two main aspects of addiction
in my in my view and this doesn't map on

3504
00:59:00,069 --> 00:59:00,079
in my in my view and this doesn't map on
 

3505
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:00,710
in my in my view and this doesn't map on
to how the

3506
00:59:00,710 --> 00:59:00,720
to how the
 

3507
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:03,510
to how the
you know the dsm the psychiatry bible

3508
00:59:03,510 --> 00:59:03,520
you know the dsm the psychiatry bible
 

3509
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:05,030
you know the dsm the psychiatry bible
defines addiction which i think is

3510
00:59:05,030 --> 00:59:05,040
defines addiction which i think is
 

3511
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:06,630
defines addiction which i think is
largely bunk you know but

3512
00:59:06,630 --> 00:59:06,640
largely bunk you know but
 

3513
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:08,150
largely bunk you know but
there's some value to have some common

3514
00:59:08,150 --> 00:59:08,160
there's some value to have some common
 

3515
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:09,910
there's some value to have some common
description but it's

3516
00:59:09,910 --> 00:59:09,920
description but it's
 

3517
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:12,750
description but it's
you know how rewarding is it from this

3518
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:12,760
you know how rewarding is it from this
 

3519
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:15,109
you know how rewarding is it from this
multi-dimensional lens

3520
00:59:15,109 --> 00:59:15,119
multi-dimensional lens
 

3521
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:17,829
multi-dimensional lens
and specifically how does it how does

3522
00:59:17,829 --> 00:59:17,839
and specifically how does it how does
 

3523
00:59:17,839 --> 00:59:19,670
and specifically how does it how does
that rewarding value compete

3524
00:59:19,670 --> 00:59:19,680
that rewarding value compete
 

3525
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:23,670
that rewarding value compete
with other rewards other consequences

3526
00:59:23,670 --> 00:59:23,680
with other rewards other consequences
 

3527
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:26,950
with other rewards other consequences
in your life so it's

3528
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:26,960
in your life so it's
 

3529
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:29,589
in your life so it's
it's not a problem if if the use of that

3530
00:59:29,589 --> 00:59:29,599
it's not a problem if if the use of that
 

3531
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:30,870
it's not a problem if if the use of that
substance

3532
00:59:30,870 --> 00:59:30,880
substance
 

3533
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:32,870
substance
is rewarding you know okay yeah you like

3534
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:32,880
is rewarding you know okay yeah you like
 

3535
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:34,390
is rewarding you know okay yeah you like
to have a couple beers every once in a

3536
00:59:34,390 --> 00:59:34,400
to have a couple beers every once in a
 

3537
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:34,950
to have a couple beers every once in a
while

3538
00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:34,960
while
 

3539
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:37,990
while
it's like not a problem i mean um

3540
00:59:37,990 --> 00:59:38,000
it's like not a problem i mean um
 

3541
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,750
it's like not a problem i mean um
but then you have the alcoholic who is

3542
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:41,760
but then you have the alcoholic who is
 

3543
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:44,150
but then you have the alcoholic who is
drinking so much that they they're it

3544
00:59:44,150 --> 00:59:44,160
drinking so much that they they're it
 

3545
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:45,670
drinking so much that they they're it
tanks their career

3546
00:59:45,670 --> 00:59:45,680
tanks their career
 

3547
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:48,069
tanks their career
it ruins their marriage it's in

3548
00:59:48,069 --> 00:59:48,079
it ruins their marriage it's in
 

3549
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:49,349
it ruins their marriage it's in
competition with these

3550
00:59:49,349 --> 00:59:49,359
competition with these
 

3551
00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:52,309
competition with these
pro-social aspects to their life it's

3552
00:59:52,309 --> 00:59:52,319
pro-social aspects to their life it's
 

3553
00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:52,950
pro-social aspects to their life it's
all about

3554
00:59:52,950 --> 00:59:52,960
all about
 

3555
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:54,950
all about
comparing to the other choices you're

3556
00:59:54,950 --> 00:59:54,960
comparing to the other choices you're
 

3557
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:57,670
comparing to the other choices you're
making the other activities in your life

3558
00:59:57,670 --> 00:59:57,680
making the other activities in your life
 

3559
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:00,549
making the other activities in your life
and if it you evaluate as a much higher

3560
01:00:00,549 --> 01:00:00,559
and if it you evaluate as a much higher
 

3561
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:02,870
and if it you evaluate as a much higher
reward

3562
01:00:02,870 --> 01:00:02,880
reward
 

3563
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:04,630
reward
than anything else that becomes an

3564
01:00:04,630 --> 01:00:04,640
than anything else that becomes an
 

3565
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:06,069
than anything else that becomes an
addiction right right

3566
01:00:06,069 --> 01:00:06,079
addiction right right
 

3567
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:08,069
addiction right right
and so it's not just the rewarding value

3568
01:00:08,069 --> 01:00:08,079
and so it's not just the rewarding value
 

3569
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:09,910
and so it's not just the rewarding value
but it's the relative rewarding value

3570
01:00:09,910 --> 01:00:09,920
but it's the relative rewarding value
 

3571
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:10,390
but it's the relative rewarding value
and

3572
01:00:10,390 --> 01:00:10,400
and
 

3573
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:12,630
and
in the other major asp again from

3574
01:00:12,630 --> 01:00:12,640
in the other major asp again from
 

3575
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:14,470
in the other major asp again from
behavioral economics the

3576
01:00:14,470 --> 01:00:14,480
behavioral economics the
 

3577
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:17,750
behavioral economics the
the the thing that makes addiction is

3578
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:17,760
the the thing that makes addiction is
 

3579
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:20,230
the the thing that makes addiction is
something called delayed discounting um

3580
01:00:20,230 --> 01:00:20,240
something called delayed discounting um
 

3581
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:22,230
something called delayed discounting um
so in economics sometimes it's called

3582
01:00:22,230 --> 01:00:22,240
so in economics sometimes it's called
 

3583
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:23,349
so in economics sometimes it's called
time preference

3584
01:00:23,349 --> 01:00:23,359
time preference
 

3585
01:00:23,359 --> 01:00:25,349
time preference
it's this is it's what compound interest

3586
01:00:25,349 --> 01:00:25,359
it's this is it's what compound interest
 

3587
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:26,710
it's this is it's what compound interest
rates are based upon

3588
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:26,720
rates are based upon
 

3589
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:29,349
rates are based upon
it's the idea that delaying a good

3590
01:00:29,349 --> 01:00:29,359
it's the idea that delaying a good
 

3591
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:32,150
it's the idea that delaying a good
access to a good or a reward

3592
01:00:32,150 --> 01:00:32,160
access to a good or a reward
 

3593
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:34,230
access to a good or a reward
comes with a certain decrement to its

3594
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:34,240
comes with a certain decrement to its
 

3595
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:36,549
comes with a certain decrement to its
value so we'd all rather have things

3596
01:00:36,549 --> 01:00:36,559
value so we'd all rather have things
 

3597
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:40,309
value so we'd all rather have things
now than later and we can study this at

3598
01:00:40,309 --> 01:00:40,319
now than later and we can study this at
 

3599
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:42,069
now than later and we can study this at
the individual level of you know would

3600
01:00:42,069 --> 01:00:42,079
the individual level of you know would
 

3601
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:43,750
the individual level of you know would
you rather have

3602
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:43,760
you rather have
 

3603
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:46,789
you rather have
nine dollars today or or ten dollars

3604
01:00:46,789 --> 01:00:46,799
nine dollars today or or ten dollars
 

3605
01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:50,390
nine dollars today or or ten dollars
tomorrow um and you get when you do that

3606
01:00:50,390 --> 01:00:50,400
tomorrow um and you get when you do that
 

3607
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:53,270
tomorrow um and you get when you do that
you get huge differences between

3608
01:00:53,270 --> 01:00:53,280
you get huge differences between
 

3609
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:54,950
you get huge differences between
addicted populations

3610
01:00:54,950 --> 01:00:54,960
addicted populations
 

3611
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:57,190
addicted populations
and non-addicted not just heroin and

3612
01:00:57,190 --> 01:00:57,200
and non-addicted not just heroin and
 

3613
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:58,470
and non-addicted not just heroin and
cocaine but like just

3614
01:00:58,470 --> 01:00:58,480
cocaine but like just
 

3615
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:00,470
cocaine but like just
cigarette smokers like normal everyday

3616
01:01:00,470 --> 01:01:00,480
cigarette smokers like normal everyday
 

3617
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:01,990
cigarette smokers like normal everyday
cigarette smokers

3618
01:01:01,990 --> 01:01:02,000
cigarette smokers
 

3619
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,230
cigarette smokers
and even when you look at something like

3620
01:01:04,230 --> 01:01:04,240
and even when you look at something like
 

3621
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:05,190
and even when you look at something like
monetary

3622
01:01:05,190 --> 01:01:05,200
monetary
 

3623
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:07,589
monetary
rewards and and so you can go into the

3624
01:01:07,589 --> 01:01:07,599
rewards and and so you can go into the
 

3625
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:08,950
rewards and and so you can go into the
rabbit hole with

3626
01:01:08,950 --> 01:01:08,960
rabbit hole with
 

3627
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:10,630
rabbit hole with
with this delay discounting model so

3628
01:01:10,630 --> 01:01:10,640
with this delay discounting model so
 

3629
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:12,150
with this delay discounting model so
it's not only those huge differences

3630
01:01:12,150 --> 01:01:12,160
it's not only those huge differences
 

3631
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:14,470
it's not only those huge differences
that seem to have a face valid

3632
01:01:14,470 --> 01:01:14,480
that seem to have a face valid
 

3633
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:16,309
that seem to have a face valid
aspect to it like the cigarette smoker

3634
01:01:16,309 --> 01:01:16,319
aspect to it like the cigarette smoker
 

3635
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:17,990
aspect to it like the cigarette smoker
is choosing this thing that's

3636
01:01:17,990 --> 01:01:18,000
is choosing this thing that's
 

3637
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,549
is choosing this thing that's
rewarding today but i know it comes with

3638
01:01:20,549 --> 01:01:20,559
rewarding today but i know it comes with
 

3639
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:21,910
rewarding today but i know it comes with
increased risk of

3640
01:01:21,910 --> 01:01:21,920
increased risk of
 

3641
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:23,430
increased risk of
having these horrible consequences down

3642
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:23,440
having these horrible consequences down
 

3643
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:24,789
having these horrible consequences down
the line so it's this competition

3644
01:01:24,789 --> 01:01:24,799
the line so it's this competition
 

3645
01:01:24,799 --> 01:01:26,230
the line so it's this competition
between what's good for me now

3646
01:01:26,230 --> 01:01:26,240
between what's good for me now
 

3647
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:28,630
between what's good for me now
and what's good for me later and the

3648
01:01:28,630 --> 01:01:28,640
and what's good for me later and the
 

3649
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:30,390
and what's good for me later and the
other aspect about delayed discounting

3650
01:01:30,390 --> 01:01:30,400
other aspect about delayed discounting
 

3651
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:31,589
other aspect about delayed discounting
is that

3652
01:01:31,589 --> 01:01:31,599
is that
 

3653
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:34,710
is that
if you quantitatively map out that

3654
01:01:34,710 --> 01:01:34,720
if you quantitatively map out that
 

3655
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:37,670
if you quantitatively map out that
that discounting curve over time so you

3656
01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:37,680
that discounting curve over time so you
 

3657
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:39,510
that discounting curve over time so you
don't just do the you know

3658
01:01:39,510 --> 01:01:39,520
don't just do the you know
 

3659
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:42,150
don't just do the you know
you know how much you know that ten

3660
01:01:42,150 --> 01:01:42,160
you know how much you know that ten
 

3661
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:44,230
you know how much you know that ten
dollars tomorrow how much is it

3662
01:01:44,230 --> 01:01:44,240
dollars tomorrow how much is it
 

3663
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:45,750
dollars tomorrow how much is it
worth to you today so you can say what

3664
01:01:45,750 --> 01:01:45,760
worth to you today so you can say what
 

3665
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:47,430
worth to you today so you can say what
about nine what about eight what about

3666
01:01:47,430 --> 01:01:47,440
about nine what about eight what about
 

3667
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:48,789
about nine what about eight what about
seven dollars and you can

3668
01:01:48,789 --> 01:01:48,799
seven dollars and you can
 

3669
01:01:48,799 --> 01:01:50,390
seven dollars and you can
titrate it to find that indifference

3670
01:01:50,390 --> 01:01:50,400
titrate it to find that indifference
 

3671
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:53,510
titrate it to find that indifference
point and so we can say aha six dollars

3672
01:01:53,510 --> 01:01:53,520
point and so we can say aha six dollars
 

3673
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:54,950
point and so we can say aha six dollars
um you know ten dollars tomorrow is

3674
01:01:54,950 --> 01:01:54,960
um you know ten dollars tomorrow is
 

3675
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:57,029
um you know ten dollars tomorrow is
worth six dollars to you uh

3676
01:01:57,029 --> 01:01:57,039
worth six dollars to you uh
 

3677
01:01:57,039 --> 01:01:59,270
worth six dollars to you uh
today so it's by the one day it's

3678
01:01:59,270 --> 01:01:59,280
today so it's by the one day it's
 

3679
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:00,870
today so it's by the one day it's
decreased by 40 percent

3680
01:02:00,870 --> 01:02:00,880
decreased by 40 percent
 

3681
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:03,670
decreased by 40 percent
we can do that also at one week and one

3682
01:02:03,670 --> 01:02:03,680
we can do that also at one week and one
 

3683
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:04,710
we can do that also at one week and one
month in one year

3684
01:02:04,710 --> 01:02:04,720
month in one year
 

3685
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:08,230
month in one year
and 10 years and map out that curve

3686
01:02:08,230 --> 01:02:08,240
and 10 years and map out that curve
 

3687
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:09,910
and 10 years and map out that curve
get a shape of that curve and one of the

3688
01:02:09,910 --> 01:02:09,920
get a shape of that curve and one of the
 

3689
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:11,589
get a shape of that curve and one of the
fascinating things about this is that

3690
01:02:11,589 --> 01:02:11,599
fascinating things about this is that
 

3691
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:13,510
fascinating things about this is that
whether you're talking about pigeons

3692
01:02:13,510 --> 01:02:13,520
whether you're talking about pigeons
 

3693
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:15,109
whether you're talking about pigeons
making these types of choices between a

3694
01:02:15,109 --> 01:02:15,119
making these types of choices between a
 

3695
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:16,549
making these types of choices between a
little bit of food now or a little bit

3696
01:02:16,549 --> 01:02:16,559
little bit of food now or a little bit
 

3697
01:02:16,559 --> 01:02:18,470
little bit of food now or a little bit
of food a minute from now or rats

3698
01:02:18,470 --> 01:02:18,480
of food a minute from now or rats
 

3699
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:20,630
of food a minute from now or rats
or every like dozens of species of

3700
01:02:20,630 --> 01:02:20,640
or every like dozens of species of
 

3701
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:22,789
or every like dozens of species of
animals tested including humans

01:02:22,789 --> 01:02:22,799
animals tested including humans
 

3703
01:02:22,799 --> 01:02:24,870
animals tested including humans
the tendency is pretty consistently that

3704
01:02:24,870 --> 01:02:24,880
the tendency is pretty consistently that
 

3705
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:26,230
the tendency is pretty consistently that
we

3706
01:02:26,230 --> 01:02:26,240
we
 

3707
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:29,670
we
we discount hyperbolically rather than

3708
01:02:29,670 --> 01:02:29,680
we discount hyperbolically rather than
 

3709
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:32,630
we discount hyperbolically rather than
exponentially what exponentially means

3710
01:02:32,630 --> 01:02:32,640
exponentially what exponentially means
 

3711
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:34,470
exponentially what exponentially means
is that every unit of time

3712
01:02:34,470 --> 01:02:34,480
is that every unit of time
 

3713
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:36,390
is that every unit of time
is associated with the same proportional

3714
01:02:36,390 --> 01:02:36,400
is associated with the same proportional
 

3715
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:38,789
is associated with the same proportional
reduction every unit of delay is

3716
01:02:38,789 --> 01:02:38,799
reduction every unit of delay is
 

3717
01:02:38,799 --> 01:02:40,630
reduction every unit of delay is
is associated with the same causes the

01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:44,549
same proportional reduction in value
and that's the way the compound interest

3722
01:02:44,549 --> 01:02:44,559
and that's the way the compound interest
 

3723
01:02:44,559 --> 01:02:46,309
and that's the way the compound interest

01:02:52,150 --> 01:02:52,160
every day you know you get this sort of

01:02:57,349 --> 01:02:57,359
this you know um will give you this
 

3737
01:02:57,359 --> 01:02:59,190
this you know um will give you this
amount of extra money to compensate you

amount of extra money to compensate you
 

3739

amount of extra money to compensate you
for that

3740
01:03:00,069 --> 01:03:00,079
for that
 

3741
01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:04,150
for that
delay but then the way that all animals

01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:06,150
delay but then the way that all animals
tend to function is of this very

3744
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:06,160
tend to function is of this very
 

3745
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:07,349
tend to function is of this very
different way

3746
01:03:07,349 --> 01:03:07,359
different way
 

3747
01:03:07,359 --> 01:03:10,470
different way
where the reductions the initial

3748
01:03:10,470 --> 01:03:10,480
where the reductions the initial
 

3749
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:12,870
where the reductions the initial
that initial delay so like one day's

3750
01:03:12,870 --> 01:03:12,880
that initial delay so like one day's
 

3751
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:15,109
that initial delay so like one day's
worth of delay you see a much stronger

3752
01:03:15,109 --> 01:03:15,119
worth of delay you see a much stronger
 

3753
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:17,190
worth of delay you see a much stronger
um discounting rate or reduction in

3754
01:03:17,190 --> 01:03:17,200
um discounting rate or reduction in
 

3755
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:18,710
um discounting rate or reduction in
value than you do

3756
01:03:18,710 --> 01:03:18,720
value than you do
 

3757
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:21,190
value than you do
over those um so you see the super

3758
01:03:21,190 --> 01:03:21,200
over those um so you see the super
 

3759
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:24,630
over those um so you see the super
proportional then it changes to

3760
01:03:24,630 --> 01:03:24,640
proportional then it changes to
 

3761
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:26,470
proportional then it changes to
these lesser rates and so the

3762
01:03:26,470 --> 01:03:26,480
these lesser rates and so the
 

3763
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:27,829
these lesser rates and so the
implication of that i know i've gone

3764
01:03:27,829 --> 01:03:27,839
implication of that i know i've gone
 

3765
01:03:27,839 --> 01:03:28,789
implication of that i know i've gone
like really into the weeds

3766
01:03:28,789 --> 01:03:28,799
like really into the weeds
 

3767
01:03:28,799 --> 01:03:30,630
like really into the weeds
quantitatively but what that means is

3768
01:03:30,630 --> 01:03:30,640
quantitatively but what that means is
 

3769
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:32,549
quantitatively but what that means is
that

3770
01:03:32,549 --> 01:03:32,559
that
 

3771
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:34,309
that
there's these preference reversals when

3772
01:03:34,309 --> 01:03:34,319
there's these preference reversals when
 

3773
01:03:34,319 --> 01:03:37,190
there's these preference reversals when
you have curves of that nature

3774
01:03:37,190 --> 01:03:37,200
you have curves of that nature
 

3775
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:42,950
you have curves of that nature
the the the decay that's hyperbolic

3776
01:03:42,950 --> 01:03:42,960

 

3777
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:46,789

it maps on to this phenomenon we see um

3778
01:03:46,789 --> 01:03:46,799
it maps on to this phenomenon we see um
 

3779
01:03:46,799 --> 01:03:48,789
it maps on to this phenomenon we see um
both in terms of how people deal with

3780
01:03:48,789 --> 01:03:48,799
both in terms of how people deal with
 

3781
01:03:48,799 --> 01:03:51,029
both in terms of how people deal with
future rewards but also how perception

3782
01:03:51,029 --> 01:03:51,039
future rewards but also how perception
 

3783
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:51,990
future rewards but also how perception
works

3784
01:03:51,990 --> 01:03:52,000
works
 

3785
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,390
works
um when two things are far away whether

3786
01:03:54,390 --> 01:03:54,400
um when two things are far away whether
 

3787
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:55,029
um when two things are far away whether
it's

3788
01:03:55,029 --> 01:03:55,039
it's
 

3789
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:57,109
it's
physical distance or whether in terms of

3790
01:03:57,109 --> 01:03:57,119
physical distance or whether in terms of
 

3791
01:03:57,119 --> 01:03:58,549
physical distance or whether in terms of
perception or whether it's in terms of

3792
01:03:58,549 --> 01:03:58,559
perception or whether it's in terms of
 

3793
01:03:58,559 --> 01:03:59,670
perception or whether it's in terms of
time

3794
01:03:59,670 --> 01:03:59,680
time
 

3795
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:02,470
time
when you're really far away the value

3796
01:04:02,470 --> 01:04:02,480
when you're really far away the value
 

3797
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:03,910
when you're really far away the value
the subjective value

3798
01:04:03,910 --> 01:04:03,920
the subjective value
 

3799
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:07,270
the subjective value
for that further that delayed reward

3800
01:04:07,270 --> 01:04:07,280
for that further that delayed reward
 

3801
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:11,029
for that further that delayed reward
is is larger so so for example like

3802
01:04:11,029 --> 01:04:11,039
is is larger so so for example like
 

3803
01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:15,230
is is larger so so for example like
let's say we're talking about 360 um

3804
01:04:15,230 --> 01:04:15,240
let's say we're talking about 360 um
 

3805
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:18,390
let's say we're talking about 360 um
364 days from now you can get nine

3806
01:04:18,390 --> 01:04:18,400
364 days from now you can get nine
 

3807
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:21,510
364 days from now you can get nine
dollars or 365 days a year

3808
01:04:21,510 --> 01:04:21,520
dollars or 365 days a year
 

3809
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:23,829
dollars or 365 days a year
now you get 10 and you're like dude it's

3810
01:04:23,829 --> 01:04:23,839
now you get 10 and you're like dude it's
 

3811
01:04:23,839 --> 01:04:25,029
now you get 10 and you're like dude it's
like it's a year like

3812
01:04:25,029 --> 01:04:25,039
like it's a year like
 

3813
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:27,190
like it's a year like
no difference like i'll take why not get

3814
01:04:27,190 --> 01:04:27,200
no difference like i'll take why not get
 

3815
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:28,230
no difference like i'll take why not get
one more dollar

3816
01:04:28,230 --> 01:04:28,240
one more dollar
 

3817
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:30,549
one more dollar
yeah you bring that same exact set of

3818
01:04:30,549 --> 01:04:30,559
yeah you bring that same exact set of
 

3819
01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:32,470
yeah you bring that same exact set of
choices closer nothing's changed other

3820
01:04:32,470 --> 01:04:32,480
choices closer nothing's changed other
 

3821
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:33,349
choices closer nothing's changed other
than the time

3822
01:04:33,349 --> 01:04:33,359
than the time
 

3823
01:04:33,359 --> 01:04:34,870
than the time
to both rewards and it's like would you

3824
01:04:34,870 --> 01:04:34,880
to both rewards and it's like would you
 

3825
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:36,870
to both rewards and it's like would you
rather have nine dollars

3826
01:04:36,870 --> 01:04:36,880
rather have nine dollars
 

3827
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:38,789
rather have nine dollars
today or ten dollars tomorrow and plenty

3828
01:04:38,789 --> 01:04:38,799
today or ten dollars tomorrow and plenty
 

3829
01:04:38,799 --> 01:04:40,150
today or ten dollars tomorrow and plenty
of people would say ah

3830
01:04:40,150 --> 01:04:40,160
of people would say ah
 

3831
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:41,910
of people would say ah
just about the sounds go ahead and take

3832
01:04:41,910 --> 01:04:41,920
just about the sounds go ahead and take
 

3833
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:44,150
just about the sounds go ahead and take
it today yeah so you see this preference

3834
01:04:44,150 --> 01:04:44,160
it today yeah so you see this preference
 

3835
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:44,870
it today yeah so you see this preference
reversal

3836
01:04:44,870 --> 01:04:44,880
reversal
 

3837
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:49,029
reversal
and so that is that's a model of

3838
01:04:49,029 --> 01:04:49,039
and so that is that's a model of
 

3839
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:52,549
and so that is that's a model of
of addiction in the sense that

3840
01:04:52,549 --> 01:04:52,559
of addiction in the sense that
 

3841
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:54,950
of addiction in the sense that
consistently with with true addiction i

3842
01:04:54,950 --> 01:04:54,960
consistently with with true addiction i
 

3843
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:57,029
consistently with with true addiction i
would argue you see this

3844
01:04:57,029 --> 01:04:57,039
would argue you see this
 

3845
01:04:57,039 --> 01:04:59,109
would argue you see this
this competition between molar and

3846
01:04:59,109 --> 01:04:59,119
this competition between molar and
 

3847
01:04:59,119 --> 01:05:00,069
this competition between molar and
molecular

3848
01:05:00,069 --> 01:05:00,079
molecular
 

3849
01:05:00,079 --> 01:05:04,069
molecular
um utility um it's like inter

3850
01:05:04,069 --> 01:05:04,079
um utility um it's like inter
 

3851
01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:06,230
um utility um it's like inter
intrapersonal like within the person

3852
01:05:06,230 --> 01:05:06,240
intrapersonal like within the person
 

3853
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:07,910
intrapersonal like within the person
competing agents

3854
01:05:07,910 --> 01:05:07,920
competing agents
 

3855
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:10,150
competing agents
someone sometimes has control of the bus

3856
01:05:10,150 --> 01:05:10,160
someone sometimes has control of the bus
 

3857
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:11,270
someone sometimes has control of the bus
that wants to do what's

3858
01:05:11,270 --> 01:05:11,280
that wants to do what's
 

3859
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:14,470
that wants to do what's
in good for you in the short term and

3860
01:05:14,470 --> 01:05:14,480
in good for you in the short term and
 

3861
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:15,589
in good for you in the short term and
someone's

3862
01:05:15,589 --> 01:05:15,599
someone's
 

3863
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:17,029
someone's
at other times that is in control of

3864
01:05:17,029 --> 01:05:17,039
at other times that is in control of
 

3865
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:18,950
at other times that is in control of
driving the bus and they're they want to

3866
01:05:18,950 --> 01:05:18,960
driving the bus and they're they want to
 

3867
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:19,670
driving the bus and they're they want to
do what's

3868
01:05:19,670 --> 01:05:19,680
do what's
 

3869
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:22,710
do what's
good for you and the long term so

3870
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:22,720
good for you and the long term so
 

3871
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:24,789
good for you and the long term so
you tell the you know you're trying to

3872
01:05:24,789 --> 01:05:24,799
you tell the you know you're trying to
 

3873
01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:26,789
you tell the you know you're trying to
quit and you see a doctor you see your

3874
01:05:26,789 --> 01:05:26,799
quit and you see a doctor you see your
 

3875
01:05:26,799 --> 01:05:28,950
quit and you see a doctor you see your
you know 12-step therapist and say god i

3876
01:05:28,950 --> 01:05:28,960
you know 12-step therapist and say god i
 

3877
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:30,710
you know 12-step therapist and say god i
know this stuff is killing me

3878
01:05:30,710 --> 01:05:30,720
know this stuff is killing me
 

3879
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:33,750
know this stuff is killing me
like i'm really i'm on the path i'm like

3880
01:05:33,750 --> 01:05:33,760
like i'm really i'm on the path i'm like
 

3881
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:35,349
like i'm really i'm on the path i'm like
i'm done

3882
01:05:35,349 --> 01:05:35,359
i'm done
 

3883
01:05:35,359 --> 01:05:36,549
i'm done
and that's when you're kind of in their

3884
01:05:36,549 --> 01:05:36,559
and that's when you're kind of in their
 

3885
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:38,309
and that's when you're kind of in their
office or wherever you're not you know

3886
01:05:38,309 --> 01:05:38,319
office or wherever you're not you know
 

3887
01:05:38,319 --> 01:05:39,670
office or wherever you're not you know
it's not around you and then later on

3888
01:05:39,670 --> 01:05:39,680
it's not around you and then later on
 

3889
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:41,750
it's not around you and then later on
that day your buddy says that hey man i

3890
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:41,760
that day your buddy says that hey man i
 

3891
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:42,470
that day your buddy says that hey man i
just scored

3892
01:05:42,470 --> 01:05:42,480
just scored
 

3893
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:43,990
just scored
i got it right here do you want it and

3894
01:05:43,990 --> 01:05:44,000
i got it right here do you want it and
 

3895
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,349
i got it right here do you want it and
that reward is right in front of you

3896
01:05:45,349 --> 01:05:45,359
that reward is right in front of you
 

3897
01:05:45,359 --> 01:05:46,870
that reward is right in front of you
that's like bringing those two choices

3898
01:05:46,870 --> 01:05:46,880
that's like bringing those two choices
 

3899
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:47,349
that's like bringing those two choices
right

3900
01:05:47,349 --> 01:05:47,359
right
 

3901
01:05:47,359 --> 01:05:49,190
right

3906
01:05:51,750 --> 01:05:51,760
and then you can go through that cycle
 

3907
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:53,510
and then you can go through that cycle
for like years of the person telling

3908
01:05:53,510 --> 01:05:53,520
for like years of the person telling
 

3909
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:54,630
for like years of the person telling
themselves

3910

01:06:08,549 --> 01:06:08,559
and this isn't just something this is
 

3927
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:10,230
and this isn't just something this is
something that has has huge clinical

3928
01:06:10,230 --> 01:06:10,240
something that has has huge clinical
 

3929
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:11,829
something that has has huge clinical
ramifications with addiction but it's

3930
01:06:11,829 --> 01:06:11,839
ramifications with addiction but it's
 

3931
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:12,150
ramifications with addiction but it's
like

3932
01:06:12,150 --> 01:06:12,160
like
 

3933
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:14,309
like
all humans do it anyone who's had hit

3934
01:06:14,309 --> 01:06:14,319
all humans do it anyone who's had hit
 

3935
01:06:14,319 --> 01:06:15,750
all humans do it anyone who's had hit
the snooze alarm in the morning like

3936
01:06:15,750 --> 01:06:15,760
the snooze alarm in the morning like
 

3937
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:17,510
the snooze alarm in the morning like
yeah the night before they realize

3938
01:06:17,510 --> 01:06:17,520
yeah the night before they realize
 

3939
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:19,430
yeah the night before they realize
oh i got to get up extra early tomorrow

3940
01:06:19,430 --> 01:06:19,440
oh i got to get up extra early tomorrow
 

3941
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:21,190
oh i got to get up extra early tomorrow
that's what's ultimately better for me

3942
01:06:21,190 --> 01:06:21,200
that's what's ultimately better for me
 

3943
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:22,549
that's what's ultimately better for me
so i'm going to set the alarm for

3944
01:06:22,549 --> 01:06:22,559
so i'm going to set the alarm for
 

3945
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:25,670
so i'm going to set the alarm for
you know 5 a.m um

3946
01:06:25,670 --> 01:06:25,680
you know 5 a.m um
 

3947
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:30,150
you know 5 a.m um
and they they it goes off at 5 00 a.m

3948
01:06:30,150 --> 01:06:30,160
and they they it goes off at 5 00 a.m
 

3949
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:32,870
and they they it goes off at 5 00 a.m
you know and then so now those two

3950
01:06:32,870 --> 01:06:32,880
you know and then so now those two
 

3951
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:34,069
you know and then so now those two
consequences have come

3952
01:06:34,069 --> 01:06:34,079
consequences have come
 

3953
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:35,829
consequences have come
sooner and it's like what the hell and

3954
01:06:35,829 --> 01:06:35,839
sooner and it's like what the hell and
 

3955
01:06:35,839 --> 01:06:37,109
sooner and it's like what the hell and
they hit the snooze alarm

3956
01:06:37,109 --> 01:06:37,119
they hit the snooze alarm
 

3957
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:38,630
they hit the snooze alarm
and something's not just once but then

3958
01:06:38,630 --> 01:06:38,640
and something's not just once but then
 

3959
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:39,990
and something's not just once but then
five minutes later and then five minutes

3960
01:06:39,990 --> 01:06:40,000
five minutes later and then five minutes
 

3961
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,029
five minutes later and then five minutes
later

3962
01:06:41,029 --> 01:06:41,039
later
 

3963
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:43,270
later
you know and so and it's why it's easier

3964
01:06:43,270 --> 01:06:43,280
you know and so and it's why it's easier
 

3965
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:45,750
you know and so and it's why it's easier
to exercise self-control

3966
01:06:45,750 --> 01:06:45,760
to exercise self-control
 

3967
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:48,150
to exercise self-control
at the grocery store compared to in your

3968
01:06:48,150 --> 01:06:48,160
at the grocery store compared to in your
 

3969
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:49,190
at the grocery store compared to in your
fridge like

3970
01:06:49,190 --> 01:06:49,200
fridge like
 

3971
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:53,270
fridge like
if that snack is like 30 seconds away

3972
01:06:53,270 --> 01:06:53,280
if that snack is like 30 seconds away
 

3973
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:56,789
if that snack is like 30 seconds away
in your fridge you're gonna more likely

3974
01:06:56,789 --> 01:06:56,799
in your fridge you're gonna more likely
 

3975
01:06:56,799 --> 01:06:59,270
in your fridge you're gonna more likely
yield to temptation than if it is

3976
01:06:59,270 --> 01:06:59,280
yield to temptation than if it is
 

3977
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:00,870
yield to temptation than if it is
further away

3978
01:07:00,870 --> 01:07:00,880
further away
 

3979
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:02,870
further away
so then just take a step back to

3980
01:07:02,870 --> 01:07:02,880
so then just take a step back to
 

3981
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:04,829
so then just take a step back to
something you brought up earlier the

3982
01:07:04,829 --> 01:07:04,839
something you brought up earlier the
 

3983
01:07:04,839 --> 01:07:08,309
something you brought up earlier the
inelasticity of pricing

3984
01:07:08,309 --> 01:07:08,319
inelasticity of pricing
 

3985
01:07:08,319 --> 01:07:11,270
inelasticity of pricing
is it uh from a perspective of the

3986
01:07:11,270 --> 01:07:11,280
is it uh from a perspective of the
 

3987
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:11,910
is it uh from a perspective of the
dealers

3988
01:07:11,910 --> 01:07:11,920
dealers
 

3989
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:14,390
dealers

3990
01:07:14,390 --> 01:07:14,400
whether we're talking about cigarettes
 

3991

whether we're talking about cigarettes
or maybe

3992
01:07:16,630 --> 01:07:16,640
or maybe
 

3993
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:19,029
or maybe
venturing slightly into the illegal

3994
01:07:19,029 --> 01:07:19,039
venturing slightly into the illegal

the nature
of pricing like so

4012

of pricing like so
 

4013
01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:39,510
of pricing like so
i i kind of assume that you meant that

4014
01:07:39,510 --> 01:07:39,520
i i kind of assume that you meant that
 

4015
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:41,029
i i kind of assume that you meant that
there's a correlation between

inelasticity of the price
 

4021
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:47,190
inelasticity of the price
so you can jack up the price is there

4022
01:07:47,190 --> 01:07:47,200
so you can jack up the price is there
 

4023
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:49,029
so you can jack up the price is there
something interesting to be said

4024
01:07:49,029 --> 01:07:49,039
something interesting to be said
 

4025
01:07:49,039 --> 01:07:52,870
something interesting to be said
both for legal drugs and illegal drugs

4026
01:07:52,870 --> 01:07:52,880
both for legal drugs and illegal drugs
 

4027

because the consumers of the product are

4032
01:08:02,470 --> 01:08:02,480
because the consumers of the product are
 

4033
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:03,829
because the consumers of the product are

addicted
 

4035
01:08:03,839 --> 01:08:06,069
addicted
right i mean i think you just described

4036
01:08:06,069 --> 01:08:06,079
right i mean i think you just described
 

4037
01:08:06,079 --> 01:08:07,750
right i mean i think you just described
it yeah you can jack up the price

4038
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:07,760
it yeah you can jack up the price
 

4039
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:09,910
it yeah you can jack up the price
and you know some people are going to

4040
01:08:09,910 --> 01:08:09,920
and you know some people are going to
 

4041
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:10,789
and you know some people are going to
drop off

4045
01:08:12,799 --> 01:08:13,829
but the people you know and it's not
dichotomous because you could just

4046
01:08:13,829 --> 01:08:13,839
dichotomous because you could just
 

4047
01:08:13,839 --> 01:08:15,029
dichotomous because you could just
consume less

4048
01:08:15,029 --> 01:08:15,039

it's interesting when you interface this
 

4063
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:29,349
it's interesting when you interface this
with policy like in one respect

4064
01:08:29,349 --> 01:08:29,359
with policy like in one respect
 

4065
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:31,590
with policy like in one respect
heavily taxing cigarettes is a good

4066
01:08:31,590 --> 01:08:31,600
heavily taxing cigarettes is a good
 

4067
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:32,950
heavily taxing cigarettes is a good
thing we know it keeps

4068
01:08:32,950 --> 01:08:32,960
thing we know it keeps
 

4069
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:35,110
thing we know it keeps
you know um adolescents particularly

4070
01:08:35,110 --> 01:08:35,120
you know um adolescents particularly
 

4071
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:36,229
you know um adolescents particularly
price sensitive so

4072
01:08:36,229 --> 01:08:36,239
price sensitive so
 

4073
01:08:36,239 --> 01:08:38,870
price sensitive so
you definitely people smoke less and

4074
01:08:38,870 --> 01:08:38,880
you definitely people smoke less and
 

4075
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:41,030
you definitely people smoke less and
especially kids smoke less when you keep

4076
01:08:41,030 --> 01:08:41,040
especially kids smoke less when you keep
 

4077
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:42,550
especially kids smoke less when you keep
cigarette prices high and you tax the

4078
01:08:42,550 --> 01:08:42,560
cigarette prices high and you tax the
 

4079
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:43,749
cigarette prices high and you tax the
hell out of them

4080
01:08:43,749 --> 01:08:43,759
hell out of them
 

4081
01:08:43,759 --> 01:08:45,990
hell out of them
um but one of the downsides you've got

4082
01:08:45,990 --> 01:08:46,000
um but one of the downsides you've got
 

4083
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,789
um but one of the downsides you've got
to balance and keep in mind is that

4084
01:08:48,789 --> 01:08:48,799
to balance and keep in mind is that
 

4085
01:08:48,799 --> 01:08:50,550
to balance and keep in mind is that
you disproportionately have working

4086
01:08:50,550 --> 01:08:50,560
you disproportionately have working
 

4087
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:52,709
you disproportionately have working
class poor people

4088
01:08:52,709 --> 01:08:52,719
class poor people
 

4089
01:08:52,719 --> 01:08:53,829
class poor people
and then you get into a point where

4090
01:08:53,829 --> 01:08:53,839
and then you get into a point where
 

4091
01:08:53,839 --> 01:08:55,749
and then you get into a point where
someone's spending you know order their

4092
01:08:55,749 --> 01:08:55,759
someone's spending you know order their
 

4093
01:08:55,759 --> 01:08:57,430
someone's spending you know order their
paycheck on so they're gonna smoke no

4094
01:08:57,430 --> 01:08:57,440
paycheck on so they're gonna smoke no
 

4095
01:08:57,440 --> 01:08:58,550
paycheck on so they're gonna smoke no
matter what

4096
01:08:58,550 --> 01:08:58,560
matter what
 

4097
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:00,229
matter what
and uh basically because they're

4098
01:09:00,229 --> 01:09:00,239
and uh basically because they're
 

4099
01:09:00,239 --> 01:09:01,749
and uh basically because they're
addicted they're gonna smoke no matter

4100
01:09:01,749 --> 01:09:01,759
addicted they're gonna smoke no matter
 

4101
01:09:01,759 --> 01:09:03,590
addicted they're gonna smoke no matter
what and you're just

4102
01:09:03,590 --> 01:09:03,600
what and you're just
 

4103
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:06,470
what and you're just
yeah you're taxing their existence right

4104
01:09:06,470 --> 01:09:06,480
yeah you're taxing their existence right
 

4105
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:07,829
yeah you're taxing their existence right
so you're making it worse for

4106
01:09:07,829 --> 01:09:07,839
so you're making it worse for
 

4107
01:09:07,839 --> 01:09:09,829
so you're making it worse for
if if they don't if they are completely

4108
01:09:09,829 --> 01:09:09,839
if if they don't if they are completely
 

4109
01:09:09,839 --> 01:09:11,349
if if they don't if they are completely
inelastic you're actually making that

4110
01:09:11,349 --> 01:09:11,359
inelastic you're actually making that
 

4111
01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:12,470
inelastic you're actually making that
person's life worse

4112
01:09:12,470 --> 01:09:12,480
person's life worse
 

4113
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:14,789
person's life worse
yeah because we know that that by by

4114
01:09:14,789 --> 01:09:14,799
yeah because we know that that by by
 

4115
01:09:14,799 --> 01:09:16,309
yeah because we know that that by by
interfering with the amount of money

4116
01:09:16,309 --> 01:09:16,319
interfering with the amount of money
 

4117
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:17,189
interfering with the amount of money
they have

4118
01:09:17,189 --> 01:09:17,199
they have
 

4119
01:09:17,199 --> 01:09:19,590
they have
you're interfering with the other um

4120
01:09:19,590 --> 01:09:19,600
you're interfering with the other um
 

4121
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:21,030
you're interfering with the other um
pro-social the potential

4122
01:09:21,030 --> 01:09:21,040
pro-social the potential
 

4123
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:23,910
pro-social the potential
competitors to smoking you know um and

4124
01:09:23,910 --> 01:09:23,920
competitors to smoking you know um and
 

4125
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:24,950
competitors to smoking you know um and
we know that

4126
01:09:24,950 --> 01:09:24,960
we know that
 

4127
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:26,470
we know that
when someone's in more impoverished

4128
01:09:26,470 --> 01:09:26,480
when someone's in more impoverished
 

4129
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:28,390
when someone's in more impoverished
environments and they have less sort of

4130
01:09:28,390 --> 01:09:28,400
environments and they have less sort of
 

4131
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:30,149
environments and they have less sort of
non-drug

4132
01:09:30,149 --> 01:09:30,159
non-drug
 

4133
01:09:30,159 --> 01:09:32,470
non-drug
alternatives you know the more likely

4134
01:09:32,470 --> 01:09:32,480
alternatives you know the more likely
 

4135
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:33,430
alternatives you know the more likely
they're gonna stay

4136
01:09:33,430 --> 01:09:33,440
they're gonna stay
 

4137
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:37,269
they're gonna stay
addicted so you know is there data

4138
01:09:37,269 --> 01:09:37,279
addicted so you know is there data
 

4139
01:09:37,279 --> 01:09:39,590
addicted so you know is there data
this is interesting from a scientific

4140
01:09:39,590 --> 01:09:39,600
this is interesting from a scientific
 

4141
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:40,550
this is interesting from a scientific
perspective

4142
01:09:40,550 --> 01:09:40,560
perspective
 

4143
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:43,590
perspective
of those same kind of games in illegal

4144
01:09:43,590 --> 01:09:43,600
of those same kind of games in illegal
 

4145
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:45,829
of those same kind of games in illegal
drugs

4146
01:09:45,829 --> 01:09:45,839
drugs
 

4147
01:09:45,839 --> 01:09:49,510
drugs
sort of uh because that's where most

4148
01:09:49,510 --> 01:09:49,520
sort of uh because that's where most
 

4149
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:50,070
sort of uh because that's where most
drug

4150
01:09:50,070 --> 01:09:50,080
drug
 

4151
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:51,590
drug
i was i mean i don't know maybe you can

4152
01:09:51,590 --> 01:09:51,600
i was i mean i don't know maybe you can
 

4153
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:53,669
i was i mean i don't know maybe you can
correct me but it seems like most drugs

4154
01:09:53,669 --> 01:09:53,679
correct me but it seems like most drugs
 

4155
01:09:53,679 --> 01:09:57,110
correct me but it seems like most drugs
are currently illegal and so

4156
01:09:57,110 --> 01:09:57,120
are currently illegal and so
 

4157
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:58,950
are currently illegal and so
but they're still in economics to them

4158
01:09:58,950 --> 01:09:58,960
but they're still in economics to them
 

4159
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:01,030
but they're still in economics to them
obviously right that's the drug war and

4160
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:01,040
obviously right that's the drug war and
 

4161
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:01,669
obviously right that's the drug war and
so on

4162
01:10:01,669 --> 01:10:01,679
so on
 

4163
01:10:01,679 --> 01:10:05,110
so on
is there data on the setting of prices

4164
01:10:05,110 --> 01:10:05,120
is there data on the setting of prices
 

4165
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:07,830
is there data on the setting of prices
or like how good are the business people

4166
01:10:07,830 --> 01:10:07,840
or like how good are the business people
 

4167
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:08,390
or like how good are the business people
running

4168
01:10:08,390 --> 01:10:08,400
running
 

4169
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:11,110
running
the selling of drugs uh that are illegal

4170
01:10:11,110 --> 01:10:11,120
the selling of drugs uh that are illegal
 

4171
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:11,750
the selling of drugs uh that are illegal
are they

4172
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:11,760
are they
 

4173
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:13,590
are they
all the same kind of rules apply from a

4174
01:10:13,590 --> 01:10:13,600
all the same kind of rules apply from a
 

4175
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:15,590
all the same kind of rules apply from a
behavioral economics perspective

4176
01:10:15,590 --> 01:10:15,600
behavioral economics perspective
 

4177
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:17,830
behavioral economics perspective
i think so i mean they're basically that

4178
01:10:17,830 --> 01:10:17,840
i think so i mean they're basically that
 

4179
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:19,430
i think so i mean they're basically that
whether they're crunching the numbers or

4180
01:10:19,430 --> 01:10:19,440
whether they're crunching the numbers or
 

4181
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:21,270
whether they're crunching the numbers or
not they're basically sensitive to that

4182
01:10:21,270 --> 01:10:21,280
not they're basically sensitive to that
 

4183
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:22,229
not they're basically sensitive to that
demand curve

4184
01:10:22,229 --> 01:10:22,239
demand curve
 

4185
01:10:22,239 --> 01:10:24,310
demand curve
and they're doing the the the same thing

4186
01:10:24,310 --> 01:10:24,320
and they're doing the the the same thing
 

4187
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:25,590
and they're doing the the the same thing
that businesses do

4188
01:10:25,590 --> 01:10:25,600
that businesses do
 

4189
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:27,990
that businesses do
in in a legal market and you know you

4190
01:10:27,990 --> 01:10:28,000
in in a legal market and you know you
 

4191
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,510
in in a legal market and you know you
want to sell as much of

4192
01:10:29,510 --> 01:10:29,520
want to sell as much of
 

4193
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:32,470
want to sell as much of
a product to get as much money you're

4194
01:10:32,470 --> 01:10:32,480
a product to get as much money you're
 

4195
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:33,910
a product to get as much money you're
looking more at the total income so if

4196
01:10:33,910 --> 01:10:33,920
looking more at the total income so if
 

4197
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:35,270
looking more at the total income so if
you jack the price

4198
01:10:35,270 --> 01:10:35,280
you jack the price
 

4199
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:37,270
you jack the price
a little bit you're going to get some

4200
01:10:37,270 --> 01:10:37,280
a little bit you're going to get some
 

4201
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:39,270
a little bit you're going to get some
reduction in consumption but it may be

4202
01:10:39,270 --> 01:10:39,280
reduction in consumption but it may be
 

4203
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:41,189
reduction in consumption but it may be
that the total amount of money that you

4204
01:10:41,189 --> 01:10:41,199
that the total amount of money that you
 

4205
01:10:41,199 --> 01:10:44,390
that the total amount of money that you
rake in is going to be more than then

4206
01:10:44,390 --> 01:10:44,400
rake in is going to be more than then
 

4207
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:46,310
rake in is going to be more than then
it's gonna overcompensate for that so

4208
01:10:46,310 --> 01:10:46,320
it's gonna overcompensate for that so
 

4209
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:47,430
it's gonna overcompensate for that so
you're willing to take okay i'm gonna

4210
01:10:47,430 --> 01:10:47,440
you're willing to take okay i'm gonna
 

4211
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:48,950
you're willing to take okay i'm gonna
lose 10 of my customers

4212
01:10:48,950 --> 01:10:48,960
lose 10 of my customers
 

4213
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:50,870
lose 10 of my customers
but i'm getting more perce you know more

4214
01:10:50,870 --> 01:10:50,880
but i'm getting more perce you know more
 

4215
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:52,950
but i'm getting more perce you know more
than enough to compensate from that

4216
01:10:52,950 --> 01:10:52,960
than enough to compensate from that
 

4217
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:54,630
than enough to compensate from that
from the extra money from the people who

4218
01:10:54,630 --> 01:10:54,640
from the extra money from the people who
 

4219
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:56,630
from the extra money from the people who
still are buying so i think they're more

4220
01:10:56,630 --> 01:10:56,640
still are buying so i think they're more
 

4221
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:57,830
still are buying so i think they're more
you know and especially when we get to

4222
01:10:57,830 --> 01:10:57,840
you know and especially when we get to
 

4223
01:10:57,840 --> 01:10:59,189
you know and especially when we get to
the lower i wouldn't be surprised if

4224
01:10:59,189 --> 01:10:59,199
the lower i wouldn't be surprised if
 

4225
01:10:59,199 --> 01:11:00,310
the lower i wouldn't be surprised if
people are

4226
01:11:00,310 --> 01:11:00,320
people are
 

4227
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:01,830
people are
crunching those numbers and looking at

4228
01:11:01,830 --> 01:11:01,840
crunching those numbers and looking at
 

4229
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:03,430
crunching those numbers and looking at
demand curves maybe at the

4230
01:11:03,430 --> 01:11:03,440
demand curves maybe at the
 

4231
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:05,189
demand curves maybe at the
you know at the really high levels of

4232
01:11:05,189 --> 01:11:05,199
you know at the really high levels of
 

4233
01:11:05,199 --> 01:11:06,870
you know at the really high levels of
the you know up the chain where the

4234
01:11:06,870 --> 01:11:06,880
the you know up the chain where the
 

4235
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:08,709
the you know up the chain where the
cartels and one i don't know

4236
01:11:08,709 --> 01:11:08,719
cartels and one i don't know
 

4237
01:11:08,719 --> 01:11:10,550
cartels and one i don't know
i that wouldn't surprise me at all but i

4238
01:11:10,550 --> 01:11:10,560
i that wouldn't surprise me at all but i
 

4239
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:12,630
i that wouldn't surprise me at all but i
think it's probably more implicit

4240
01:11:12,630 --> 01:11:12,640
think it's probably more implicit
 

4241
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:15,750
think it's probably more implicit
at the lower levels where um

4242
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:15,760
at the lower levels where um
 

4243
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:17,189
at the lower levels where um
something he brought up drug policy i

4244
01:11:17,189 --> 01:11:17,199
something he brought up drug policy i
 

4245
01:11:17,199 --> 01:11:18,790
something he brought up drug policy i
will say that i for

4246
01:11:18,790 --> 01:11:18,800
will say that i for
 

4247
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:21,110
will say that i for
for years now it's been this kind of

4248
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:21,120
for years now it's been this kind of
 

4249
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:22,390
for years now it's been this kind of
unquestioned

4250
01:11:22,390 --> 01:11:22,400
unquestioned
 

4251
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:25,510
unquestioned
goal um by for example the the drug

4252
01:11:25,510 --> 01:11:25,520
goal um by for example the the drug
 

4253
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:26,630
goal um by for example the the drug
czar's office

4254
01:11:26,630 --> 01:11:26,640
czar's office
 

4255
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:30,310
czar's office
um in the u.s to make the price of

4256
01:11:30,310 --> 01:11:30,320
um in the u.s to make the price of
 

4257
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:32,550
um in the u.s to make the price of
illegal drugs as high as possible

4258
01:11:32,550 --> 01:11:32,560
illegal drugs as high as possible
 

4259
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:34,709
illegal drugs as high as possible
without this kind of nuanced approach

4260
01:11:34,709 --> 01:11:34,719
without this kind of nuanced approach
 

4261
01:11:34,719 --> 01:11:36,390
without this kind of nuanced approach
that um

4262
01:11:36,390 --> 01:11:36,400
that um
 

4263
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:38,950
that um
yeah if you make you know for some

4264
01:11:38,950 --> 01:11:38,960
yeah if you make you know for some
 

4265
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:40,550
yeah if you make you know for some
people if you you know if you make the

4266
01:11:40,550 --> 01:11:40,560
people if you you know if you make the
 

4267
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:41,030
people if you you know if you make the
price

4268
01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:41,040
price
 

4269
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:42,950
price
so high you're actually making things

4270
01:11:42,950 --> 01:11:42,960
so high you're actually making things
 

4271
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:45,189
so high you're actually making things
worse i mean i'm all about

4272
01:11:45,189 --> 01:11:45,199
worse i mean i'm all about
 

4273
01:11:45,199 --> 01:11:47,430
worse i mean i'm all about
reducing the problems associated with

4274
01:11:47,430 --> 01:11:47,440
reducing the problems associated with
 

4275
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:49,030
reducing the problems associated with
drugs and drug addictions and part of

4276
01:11:49,030 --> 01:11:49,040
drugs and drug addictions and part of
 

4277
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:50,229
drugs and drug addictions and part of
that is the

4278
01:11:50,229 --> 01:11:50,239
that is the
 

4279
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:51,830
that is the
are more direct consequences of those

4280
01:11:51,830 --> 01:11:51,840
are more direct consequences of those
 

4281
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:53,990
are more direct consequences of those
drugs themselves and but a whole

4282
01:11:53,990 --> 01:11:54,000
drugs themselves and but a whole
 

4283
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:57,430
drugs themselves and but a whole
lot is what you get from indirectly

4284
01:11:57,430 --> 01:11:57,440
lot is what you get from indirectly
 

4285
01:11:57,440 --> 01:11:59,750
lot is what you get from indirectly
and and you know sort of the inc both

4286
01:11:59,750 --> 01:11:59,760
and and you know sort of the inc both
 

4287
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:01,430
and and you know sort of the inc both
for the individual and for society

4288
01:12:01,430 --> 01:12:01,440
for the individual and for society
 

4289
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:02,470
for the individual and for society
society so

4290
01:12:02,470 --> 01:12:02,480
society so
 

4291
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:04,630
society so
like making a poor person who doesn't

4292
01:12:04,630 --> 01:12:04,640
like making a poor person who doesn't
 

4293
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:05,910
like making a poor person who doesn't
have enough money for their kids making

4294
01:12:05,910 --> 01:12:05,920
have enough money for their kids making
 

4295
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:07,830
have enough money for their kids making
them even poorer so now you've made

4296
01:12:07,830 --> 01:12:07,840
them even poorer so now you've made
 

4297
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:10,709
them even poorer so now you've made
their their chil children's future worse

4298
01:12:10,709 --> 01:12:10,719
their their chil children's future worse
 

4299
01:12:10,719 --> 01:12:11,910
their their chil children's future worse
because they're growing up in deeper

4300
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:11,920
because they're growing up in deeper
 

4301
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:13,270
because they're growing up in deeper
poverty because you've essentially

4302
01:12:13,270 --> 01:12:13,280
poverty because you've essentially
 

4303
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:14,709
poverty because you've essentially
levied a tax

4304
01:12:14,709 --> 01:12:14,719
levied a tax
 

4305
01:12:14,719 --> 01:12:17,189
levied a tax
on to this person who's heavily uh

4306
01:12:17,189 --> 01:12:17,199
on to this person who's heavily uh
 

4307
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:18,070
on to this person who's heavily uh
addicted

4308
01:12:18,070 --> 01:12:18,080
addicted
 

4309
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:20,950
addicted
um but then it's at the societal level

4310
01:12:20,950 --> 01:12:20,960
um but then it's at the societal level
 

4311
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:21,750
um but then it's at the societal level
you know so

4312
01:12:21,750 --> 01:12:21,760
you know so
 

4313
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:23,430
you know so
everything we know about the drug war in

4314
01:12:23,430 --> 01:12:23,440
everything we know about the drug war in
 

4315
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:25,990
everything we know about the drug war in
terms of the the heavy criminalization

4316
01:12:25,990 --> 01:12:26,000
terms of the the heavy criminalization
 

4317
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:26,709
terms of the the heavy criminalization
and filling up

4318
01:12:26,709 --> 01:12:26,719
and filling up
 

4319
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:29,350
and filling up
prisons and reducing employment and

4320
01:12:29,350 --> 01:12:29,360
prisons and reducing employment and
 

4321
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:31,590
prisons and reducing employment and
educational opportunities

4322
01:12:31,590 --> 01:12:31,600
educational opportunities
 

4323
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:33,030
educational opportunities
which in the big picture we know are the

4324
01:12:33,030 --> 01:12:33,040
which in the big picture we know are the
 

4325
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:34,709
which in the big picture we know are the
things that

4326
01:12:34,709 --> 01:12:34,719
things that
 

4327
01:12:34,719 --> 01:12:37,110
things that
in a free market compete against some of

4328
01:12:37,110 --> 01:12:37,120
in a free market compete against some of
 

4329
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:38,149
in a free market compete against some of
the worst problems

4330
01:12:38,149 --> 01:12:38,159
the worst problems
 

4331
01:12:38,159 --> 01:12:40,070
the worst problems
of addiction is actually having

4332
01:12:40,070 --> 01:12:40,080
of addiction is actually having
 

4333
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:42,070
of addiction is actually having
educational and employment opportunities

4334
01:12:42,070 --> 01:12:42,080
educational and employment opportunities
 

4335
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:43,510
educational and employment opportunities
but when you get give someone a felony

4336
01:12:43,510 --> 01:12:43,520
but when you get give someone a felony
 

4337
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:46,149
but when you get give someone a felony
for example um

4338
01:12:46,149 --> 01:12:46,159
for example um
 

4339
01:12:46,159 --> 01:12:47,350
for example um
you're pretty much guaranteeing they're

4340
01:12:47,350 --> 01:12:47,360
you're pretty much guaranteeing they're
 

4341
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:48,630
you're pretty much guaranteeing they're
never going to go very high on the

4342
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:48,640
never going to go very high on the
 

4343
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:50,149
never going to go very high on the
economic ladder

4344
01:12:50,149 --> 01:12:50,159
economic ladder
 

4345
01:12:50,159 --> 01:12:52,870
economic ladder
and so you're making drugs a better

4346
01:12:52,870 --> 01:12:52,880
and so you're making drugs a better
 

4347
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:53,669
and so you're making drugs a better
reward

4348
01:12:53,669 --> 01:12:53,679
reward
 

4349
01:12:53,679 --> 01:12:57,510
reward
for that person's future so this is

4350
01:12:57,510 --> 01:12:57,520
for that person's future so this is
 

4351
01:12:57,520 --> 01:13:00,630
for that person's future so this is
a quick step into the policy realm and i

4352
01:13:00,630 --> 01:13:00,640
a quick step into the policy realm and i
 

4353
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:01,830
a quick step into the policy realm and i
think

4354
01:13:01,830 --> 01:13:01,840
think
 

4355
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:03,510
think
for both you and i i'm not sure you can

4356
01:13:03,510 --> 01:13:03,520
for both you and i i'm not sure you can
 

4357
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:05,830
for both you and i i'm not sure you can
correct me but i'm more comfortable into

4358
01:13:05,830 --> 01:13:05,840
correct me but i'm more comfortable into
 

4359
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,030
correct me but i'm more comfortable into
studying

4360
01:13:07,030 --> 01:13:07,040
studying
 

4361
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:10,390
studying
the effects of drugs on the um

4362
01:13:10,390 --> 01:13:10,400
the effects of drugs on the um
 

4363
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:11,990
the effects of drugs on the um
human behavior in human psychology

4364
01:13:11,990 --> 01:13:12,000
human behavior in human psychology
 

4365
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,070
human behavior in human psychology
versus like policy it seems like a whole

4366
01:13:14,070 --> 01:13:14,080
versus like policy it seems like a whole
 

4367
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:16,070
versus like policy it seems like a whole
giant mess but yeah there's some

4368
01:13:16,070 --> 01:13:16,080
giant mess but yeah there's some
 

4369
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:18,790
giant mess but yeah there's some
libertarian

4370
01:13:18,790 --> 01:13:18,800
libertarian
 

4371
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:20,950
libertarian
candidates for president and just

4372
01:13:20,950 --> 01:13:20,960
candidates for president and just
 

4373
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:23,030
candidates for president and just
libertarian thinkers

4374
01:13:23,030 --> 01:13:23,040
libertarian thinkers
 

4375
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:26,070
libertarian thinkers
that had a nice thought experiment

4376
01:13:26,070 --> 01:13:26,080
that had a nice thought experiment
 

4377
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:29,110
that had a nice thought experiment
of possibly legalizing i was spoken

4378
01:13:29,110 --> 01:13:29,120
of possibly legalizing i was spoken
 

4379
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:30,950
of possibly legalizing i was spoken
about possibly legalizing

4380
01:13:30,950 --> 01:13:30,960
about possibly legalizing
 

4381
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:34,790
about possibly legalizing
basically all drugs in your intuition

4382
01:13:34,790 --> 01:13:34,800
basically all drugs in your intuition
 

4383
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:38,550
basically all drugs in your intuition
do you think a world where all drugs are

4384
01:13:38,550 --> 01:13:38,560
do you think a world where all drugs are
 

4385
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:39,669
do you think a world where all drugs are
legal

4386
01:13:39,669 --> 01:13:39,679
legal
 

4387
01:13:39,679 --> 01:13:43,590
legal
is a safer world or a less safe world

4388
01:13:43,590 --> 01:13:43,600
is a safer world or a less safe world
 

4389
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:45,590
is a safer world or a less safe world
for the users of those drugs it really

4390
01:13:45,590 --> 01:13:45,600
for the users of those drugs it really
 

4391
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:47,750
for the users of those drugs it really
depends on what we mean by legalization

4392
01:13:47,750 --> 01:13:47,760
depends on what we mean by legalization
 

4393
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:49,350
depends on what we mean by legalization
so this is one of my beefs with

4394
01:13:49,350 --> 01:13:49,360
so this is one of my beefs with
 

4395
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:50,950
so this is one of my beefs with
this you know how these things are

4396
01:13:50,950 --> 01:13:50,960
this you know how these things are
 

4397
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:54,870
this you know how these things are
talked about i mean we have very few

4398
01:13:54,870 --> 01:13:54,880
talked about i mean we have very few
 

4399
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:58,229
talked about i mean we have very few
completely laissez-faire you know

4400
01:13:58,229 --> 01:13:58,239
completely laissez-faire you know
 

4401
01:13:58,239 --> 01:14:01,270
completely laissez-faire you know
legal drugs so even caffeine is one of

4402
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:01,280
legal drugs so even caffeine is one of
 

4403
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:03,350
legal drugs so even caffeine is one of
the few examples so for example caffeine

4404
01:14:03,350 --> 01:14:03,360
the few examples so for example caffeine
 

4405
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:04,470
the few examples so for example caffeine
and tea and coffee

4406
01:14:04,470 --> 01:14:04,480
and tea and coffee
 

4407
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:06,470
and tea and coffee
is in that realm like there's no limits

4408
01:14:06,470 --> 01:14:06,480
is in that realm like there's no limits
 

4409
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:08,070
is in that realm like there's no limits
no one's testing there's no laws

4410
01:14:08,070 --> 01:14:08,080
no one's testing there's no laws
 

4411
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:10,070
no one's testing there's no laws
regulation at any level of how much

4412
01:14:10,070 --> 01:14:10,080
regulation at any level of how much
 

4413
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:11,189
regulation at any level of how much
caffeine you're allowed to buy or how

4414
01:14:11,189 --> 01:14:11,199
caffeine you're allowed to buy or how
 

4415
01:14:11,199 --> 01:14:12,630
caffeine you're allowed to buy or how
much in the price but even like with

4416
01:14:12,630 --> 01:14:12,640
much in the price but even like with
 

4417
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:13,270
much in the price but even like with
this um

4418
01:14:13,270 --> 01:14:13,280
this um
 

4419
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:15,750
this um
starbucks like nitro there are rules

4420
01:14:15,750 --> 01:14:15,760
starbucks like nitro there are rules
 

4421
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:16,790
starbucks like nitro there are rules
with soda

4422
01:14:16,790 --> 01:14:16,800
with soda
 

4423
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:18,390
with soda
and with canned products you can only

4424
01:14:18,390 --> 01:14:18,400
and with canned products you can only
 

4425
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:19,990
and with canned products you can only
put so much in there yeah

4426
01:14:19,990 --> 01:14:20,000
put so much in there yeah
 

4427
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,630
put so much in there yeah
yeah so there's this is fda regulated

4428
01:14:22,630 --> 01:14:22,640
yeah so there's this is fda regulated
 

4429
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:23,990
yeah so there's this is fda regulated
and it's kind of weird because there's a

4430
01:14:23,990 --> 01:14:24,000
and it's kind of weird because there's a
 

4431
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,430
and it's kind of weird because there's a
limit to sodas that's not there for

4432
01:14:25,430 --> 01:14:25,440
limit to sodas that's not there for
 

4433
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:27,270
limit to sodas that's not there for
energy drinks and other things so

4434
01:14:27,270 --> 01:14:27,280
energy drinks and other things so
 

4435
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:29,830
energy drinks and other things so
but you know so even caffeine it depends

4436
01:14:29,830 --> 01:14:29,840
but you know so even caffeine it depends
 

4437
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:31,350
but you know so even caffeine it depends
on what product we're talking about

4438
01:14:31,350 --> 01:14:31,360
on what product we're talking about
 

4439
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:33,189
on what product we're talking about
like if you're like nodos and other

4440
01:14:33,189 --> 01:14:33,199
like if you're like nodos and other
 

4441
01:14:33,199 --> 01:14:34,950
like if you're like nodos and other
caffeine products over the counter like

4442
01:14:34,950 --> 01:14:34,960
caffeine products over the counter like
 

4443
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:36,630
caffeine products over the counter like
you can't just put 800 milligrams in

4444
01:14:36,630 --> 01:14:36,640
you can't just put 800 milligrams in
 

4445
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:38,149
you can't just put 800 milligrams in
there the pills are like one or 200

4446
01:14:38,149 --> 01:14:38,159
there the pills are like one or 200
 

4447
01:14:38,159 --> 01:14:39,270
there the pills are like one or 200
milligrams

4448
01:14:39,270 --> 01:14:39,280
milligrams
 

4449
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:40,709
milligrams
and so it's fda regulated as an

4450
01:14:40,709 --> 01:14:40,719
and so it's fda regulated as an
 

4451
01:14:40,719 --> 01:14:42,470
and so it's fda regulated as an
overcounter drug some of the most

4452
01:14:42,470 --> 01:14:42,480
overcounter drug some of the most
 

4453
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:45,030
overcounter drug some of the most
dangerous drugs in society

4454
01:14:45,030 --> 01:14:45,040
dangerous drugs in society
 

4455
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:46,550
dangerous drugs in society
i would say arguably one of the most

4456
01:14:46,550 --> 01:14:46,560
i would say arguably one of the most
 

4457
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:47,590
i would say arguably one of the most
dangerous classes of drugs is the

4458
01:14:47,590 --> 01:14:47,600
dangerous classes of drugs is the
 

4459
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:49,510
dangerous classes of drugs is the
volatile anesthetics huffing

4460
01:14:49,510 --> 01:14:49,520
volatile anesthetics huffing
 

4461
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:51,270
volatile anesthetics huffing
people huffing gasoline and you know

4462
01:14:51,270 --> 01:14:51,280
people huffing gasoline and you know
 

4463
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:53,189
people huffing gasoline and you know
airplane glue toluene

4464
01:14:53,189 --> 01:14:53,199
airplane glue toluene
 

4465
01:14:53,199 --> 01:14:56,550
airplane glue toluene
whatnot severely damaging to the nervous

4466
01:14:56,550 --> 01:14:56,560
whatnot severely damaging to the nervous
 

4467
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:58,390
whatnot severely damaging to the nervous
system

4468
01:14:58,390 --> 01:14:58,400
system
 

4469
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:00,630
system
pretty much legal but there's some

4470
01:15:00,630 --> 01:15:00,640
pretty much legal but there's some
 

4471
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:02,149
pretty much legal but there's some
regulation in the sense that there's a

4472
01:15:02,149 --> 01:15:02,159
regulation in the sense that there's a
 

4473
01:15:02,159 --> 01:15:03,990
regulation in the sense that there's a
warning label like it's illegal to do it

4474
01:15:03,990 --> 01:15:04,000
warning label like it's illegal to do it
 

4475

yeah so anyway just as some extreme
 

4503
01:15:29,199 --> 01:15:30,070
yeah so anyway just as some extreme
examples at

4504
01:15:30,070 --> 01:15:30,080
examples at
 

4505
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:33,430
examples at
at the end and then you know even the

4506
01:15:33,430 --> 01:15:33,440
at the end and then you know even the
 

4507
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:34,790
at the end and then you know even the
the so-called illegal

4508
01:15:34,790 --> 01:15:34,800
the so-called illegal
 

4509
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:36,630
the so-called illegal

in terms of schedule two which is
 

4515
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:41,350
in terms of schedule two which is
ironically less restrictive than

4516
01:15:41,350 --> 01:15:41,360
ironically less restrictive than
 

4517
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:42,790
ironically less restrictive than
psilocybin but methamphetamine and

even though the feds don't have the
resources to go after they don't want

4704
01:18:51,189 --> 01:18:51,199
resources to go after they don't want
 

4705
01:18:51,199 --> 01:18:52,550
resources to go after they don't want
the controversy at this point to go

4706
01:18:52,550 --> 01:18:52,560
the controversy at this point to go
 

4707
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:54,630
the controversy at this point to go
after the individual users or even the

4708
01:18:54,630 --> 01:18:54,640
after the individual users or even the
 

4709
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:56,229
after the individual users or even the
the sellers in those legal states so

4710
01:18:56,229 --> 01:18:56,239
the sellers in those legal states so
 

4711
01:18:56,239 --> 01:18:57,910
the sellers in those legal states so
there's always this nuance but it's

4712
01:18:57,910 --> 01:18:57,920
there's always this nuance but it's
 

4713
01:18:57,920 --> 01:18:59,590
there's always this nuance but it's
it's about right the right regulation so

4714
01:18:59,590 --> 01:18:59,600
it's about right the right regulation so
 

4715
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:02,070
it's about right the right regulation so
i think we already know enough that

4716
01:19:02,070 --> 01:19:02,080
i think we already know enough that
 

4717
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:04,070
i think we already know enough that
for example like i think safe injection

4718
01:19:04,070 --> 01:19:04,080
for example like i think safe injection
 

4719
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:05,669
for example like i think safe injection
sites for hard drugs

4720
01:19:05,669 --> 01:19:05,679
sites for hard drugs
 

4721
01:19:05,679 --> 01:19:07,430
sites for hard drugs
um makes a lot of sense like i wouldn't

4722
01:19:07,430 --> 01:19:07,440
um makes a lot of sense like i wouldn't
 

4723
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:09,990
um makes a lot of sense like i wouldn't
want um

4724
01:19:09,990 --> 01:19:10,000
want um
 

4725
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,229
want um
heroin and cocaine at the convenience

4726
01:19:12,229 --> 01:19:12,239
heroin and cocaine at the convenience
 

4727
01:19:12,239 --> 01:19:13,830
heroin and cocaine at the convenience
stores and i don't think maybe there's

4728
01:19:13,830 --> 01:19:13,840
stores and i don't think maybe there's
 

4729
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:15,910
stores and i don't think maybe there's
some extreme libertarians that want that

4730
01:19:15,910 --> 01:19:15,920
some extreme libertarians that want that
 

4731
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:18,709
some extreme libertarians that want that
i think even the folks that identify as

4732
01:19:18,709 --> 01:19:18,719
i think even the folks that identify as
 

4733
01:19:18,719 --> 01:19:19,669
i think even the folks that identify as
libertarians probably

4734
01:19:19,669 --> 01:19:19,679
libertarians probably
 

4735
01:19:19,679 --> 01:19:21,590
libertarians probably
most of them don't well i don't know

4736
01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:21,600
most of them don't well i don't know
 

4737
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:23,030
most of them don't well i don't know
like not all of them want that

4738
01:19:23,030 --> 01:19:23,040
like not all of them want that
 

4739
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:26,550
like not all of them want that
you know um i think you know that as a

4740
01:19:26,550 --> 01:19:26,560
you know um i think you know that as a
 

4741
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:27,990
you know um i think you know that as a
form of regulation like look

4742
01:19:27,990 --> 01:19:28,000
form of regulation like look
 

4743
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,229
form of regulation like look
if you're using these hard drugs on a on

you're putting yourself at risk for
 

4749

um if you're gonna do it if you're doing
 

4757
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:43,430
um if you're gonna do it if you're doing
it anyway

4758
01:19:43,430 --> 01:19:43,440
it anyway
 

4759
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:45,110
it anyway
come to this place where at least you're

4760
01:19:45,110 --> 01:19:45,120
come to this place where at least you're
 

4761
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:47,350
come to this place where at least you're
not like you know

4762
01:19:47,350 --> 01:19:47,360
not like you know
 

4763
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:49,990
not like you know
like pulling the the water out of like

4764
01:19:49,990 --> 01:19:50,000
like pulling the the water out of like
 

4765
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:50,470
like pulling the the water out of like
you know

4766
01:19:50,470 --> 01:19:50,480
you know
 

4767
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:52,149
you know
the puddle on the side of the street

4768
01:19:52,149 --> 01:19:52,159
the puddle on the side of the street
 

4769
01:19:52,159 --> 01:19:54,149
the puddle on the side of the street
yeah so it's done by professionals and

4770
01:19:54,149 --> 01:19:54,159
yeah so it's done by professionals and
 

4771
01:19:54,159 --> 01:19:55,910
yeah so it's done by professionals and
those professionals are able to educate

4772
01:19:55,910 --> 01:19:55,920
those professionals are able to educate
 

4773
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:56,950
those professionals are able to educate
you also

4774
01:19:56,950 --> 01:19:56,960
you also
 

4775
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:59,990
you also
so like a 7-eleven clerk may not be

4776
01:19:59,990 --> 01:20:00,000
so like a 7-eleven clerk may not be
 

4777
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,990
so like a 7-eleven clerk may not be
both capable of of helping you to uh to

4778
01:20:03,990 --> 01:20:04,000
both capable of of helping you to uh to
 

4779
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,750
both capable of of helping you to uh to
inject the drug properly but also it

4780
01:20:05,750 --> 01:20:05,760
inject the drug properly but also it
 

4781
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:06,149
inject the drug properly but also it
won't

4782
01:20:06,149 --> 01:20:06,159
won't
 

4783
01:20:06,159 --> 01:20:08,149
won't
be equipped to educate you at but the

4784
01:20:08,149 --> 01:20:08,159
be equipped to educate you at but the
 

4785
01:20:08,159 --> 01:20:09,750
be equipped to educate you at but the
negative consequences all those kinds of

4786
01:20:09,750 --> 01:20:09,760
negative consequences all those kinds of
 

4787
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:11,189
negative consequences all those kinds of
things that's a huge part of it the

4788
01:20:11,189 --> 01:20:11,199
things that's a huge part of it the
 

4789
01:20:11,199 --> 01:20:12,390
things that's a huge part of it the
education but then i

4790
01:20:12,390 --> 01:20:12,400
education but then i
 

4791
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:14,870
education but then i
i think with the opioids like the big

4792
01:20:14,870 --> 01:20:14,880
i think with the opioids like the big
 

4793
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:17,189
i think with the opioids like the big
part of it is just like

4794
01:20:17,189 --> 01:20:17,199
part of it is just like
 

4795
01:20:17,199 --> 01:20:19,350
part of it is just like
with naloxone which is an antagonist it

4796
01:20:19,350 --> 01:20:19,360
with naloxone which is an antagonist it
 

4797
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:20,390
with naloxone which is an antagonist it
goes into the

4798
01:20:20,390 --> 01:20:20,400
goes into the
 

4799
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:22,870
goes into the
um the receptor it's called narcan

4800
01:20:22,870 --> 01:20:22,880
um the receptor it's called narcan
 

4801
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:24,229
um the receptor it's called narcan
that's the trade name but

4802
01:20:24,229 --> 01:20:24,239
that's the trade name but
 

4803
01:20:24,239 --> 01:20:25,590
that's the trade name but
it's what they revive people on an

4804
01:20:25,590 --> 01:20:25,600
it's what they revive people on an
 

4805
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:27,990
it's what they revive people on an
opioid overdose that's almost completely

4806
01:20:27,990 --> 01:20:28,000
opioid overdose that's almost completely
 

4807
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,030
opioid overdose that's almost completely
effective

4808
01:20:29,030 --> 01:20:29,040
effective
 

4809
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:30,629
effective
like if there's a medical professional

4810
01:20:30,629 --> 01:20:30,639
like if there's a medical professional
 

4811
01:20:30,639 --> 01:20:33,189
like if there's a medical professional
there and someone's odin on an opioid

4812
01:20:33,189 --> 01:20:33,199
there and someone's odin on an opioid
 

4813
01:20:33,199 --> 01:20:35,189
there and someone's odin on an opioid
they're virtually guaranteed to live

4814
01:20:35,189 --> 01:20:35,199
they're virtually guaranteed to live
 

4815
01:20:35,199 --> 01:20:36,629
they're virtually guaranteed to live
like that's remarkable

4816
01:20:36,629 --> 01:20:36,639
like that's remarkable
 

4817
01:20:36,639 --> 01:20:39,350
like that's remarkable
that if a hundred percent at the opioid

4818
01:20:39,350 --> 01:20:39,360
that if a hundred percent at the opioid
 

4819
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:40,070
that if a hundred percent at the opioid
crisis

4820
01:20:40,070 --> 01:20:40,080
crisis
 

4821
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:41,510
crisis
you know if all of those people right

4822
01:20:41,510 --> 01:20:41,520
you know if all of those people right
 

4823
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:43,590
you know if all of those people right
now that are dying we're doing that in

4824
01:20:43,590 --> 01:20:43,600
now that are dying we're doing that in
 

4825
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:45,189
now that are dying we're doing that in
the presence of a medical professional

4826
01:20:45,189 --> 01:20:45,199
the presence of a medical professional
 

4827
01:20:45,199 --> 01:20:46,790
the presence of a medical professional
like even like a nurse

4828
01:20:46,790 --> 01:20:46,800
like even like a nurse
 

4829
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:49,590
like even like a nurse
with narcan there'd be basic almost no

4830
01:20:49,590 --> 01:20:49,600
with narcan there'd be basic almost no
 

4831
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:51,030
with narcan there'd be basic almost no
deaths there's always some exceptions

4832
01:20:51,030 --> 01:20:51,040
deaths there's always some exceptions
 

4833
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:51,669
deaths there's always some exceptions
but

4834
01:20:51,669 --> 01:20:51,679
but
 

4835
01:20:51,679 --> 01:20:53,430
but
you know almost no deaths like that's

4836
01:20:53,430 --> 01:20:53,440
you know almost no deaths like that's
 

4837
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:55,430
you know almost no deaths like that's
staggering to me so the idea that people

4838
01:20:55,430 --> 01:20:55,440
staggering to me so the idea that people
 

4839
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:57,510
staggering to me so the idea that people
are doing this

4840
01:20:57,510 --> 01:20:57,520
are doing this
 

4841
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:59,510
are doing this
you know that we could have that level

4842
01:20:59,510 --> 01:20:59,520
you know that we could have that level
 

4843
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:01,030
you know that we could have that level
of positive effect

4844
01:21:01,030 --> 01:21:01,040
of positive effect
 

4845
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:02,790
of positive effect
without encouraging the drug and this is

4846
01:21:02,790 --> 01:21:02,800
without encouraging the drug and this is
 

4847
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:04,470
without encouraging the drug and this is
where like you get into this like

4848
01:21:04,470 --> 01:21:04,480
where like you get into this like
 

4849
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:05,910
where like you get into this like
terrain of like sending the wrong

4850
01:21:05,910 --> 01:21:05,920
terrain of like sending the wrong
 

4851
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:07,750
terrain of like sending the wrong
message and it's like

4852
01:21:07,750 --> 01:21:07,760
message and it's like
 

4853
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:09,910
message and it's like
no you can do that you can say like

4854
01:21:09,910 --> 01:21:09,920
no you can do that you can say like
 

4855
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:11,110
no you can do that you can say like
we're not

4856
01:21:11,110 --> 01:21:11,120
we're not
 

4857
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:13,510
we're not
encouraging this in fact probably one of

4858
01:21:13,510 --> 01:21:13,520
encouraging this in fact probably one of
 

4859
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:15,189
encouraging this in fact probably one of
the greatest advertisements

4860
01:21:15,189 --> 01:21:15,199
the greatest advertisements
 

4861
01:21:15,199 --> 01:21:17,030
the greatest advertisements
for not getting hooked on heroin is like

4862

happen and you have to weigh that
 

5411
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:52,229
happen and you have to weigh that
against

intuition that really hasn't worked

5418
01:29:57,350 --> 01:29:57,360
intuition that really hasn't worked
 

5419
01:29:57,360 --> 01:29:58,950
intuition that really hasn't worked
throughout the history when we've tried

5420
01:29:58,950 --> 01:29:58,960
throughout the history when we've tried
 

5421
01:29:58,960 --> 01:29:59,669
throughout the history when we've tried
it

5422
01:29:59,669 --> 01:29:59,679
it
 

5423
01:29:59,679 --> 01:30:01,750
it
right but i see a potential path forward

5424
01:30:01,750 --> 01:30:01,760
right but i see a potential path forward
 

5425
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:04,229
right but i see a potential path forward
but only if it's well

5426
01:30:04,229 --> 01:30:04,239
but only if it's well
 

5427
01:30:04,239 --> 01:30:05,189
but only if it's well
if it's not in conjunction with

5428
01:30:05,189 --> 01:30:05,199
if it's not in conjunction with
 

5429
01:30:05,199 --> 01:30:06,629
if it's not in conjunction with
e-cigarettes if there's a clear

5430
01:30:06,629 --> 01:30:06,639
e-cigarettes if there's a clear
 

5431
01:30:06,639 --> 01:30:07,910
e-cigarettes if there's a clear
alternative that's a positive

5432
01:30:07,910 --> 01:30:07,920
alternative that's a positive
 

5433
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:09,750
alternative that's a positive
alternative that you it kind of

5434
01:30:09,750 --> 01:30:09,760
alternative that you it kind of
 

5435
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:13,270
alternative that you it kind of
stares the population that right

5436
01:30:13,270 --> 01:30:13,280
stares the population that right
 

5437
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:14,870
stares the population that right
towards an alternative yeah the

5438
01:30:14,870 --> 01:30:14,880
towards an alternative yeah the
 

5439
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:16,470
towards an alternative yeah the
difference here the the unique thing

5440
01:30:16,470 --> 01:30:16,480
difference here the the unique thing
 

5441
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:17,990
difference here the the unique thing
that could be taken advantage of here is

5442
01:30:17,990 --> 01:30:18,000
that could be taken advantage of here is
 

5443
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:19,669
that could be taken advantage of here is
nicotine is by and large not what causes

5444
01:30:19,669 --> 01:30:19,679
nicotine is by and large not what causes
 

5445
01:30:19,679 --> 01:30:20,629
nicotine is by and large not what causes
the harm

5446
01:30:20,629 --> 01:30:20,639
the harm
 

5447
01:30:20,639 --> 01:30:23,110
the harm
it's the the aromatic hydrocarbons it's

5448
01:30:23,110 --> 01:30:23,120
it's the the aromatic hydrocarbons it's
 

5449
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:25,270
it's the the aromatic hydrocarbons it's
the the carcinogens in

5450
01:30:25,270 --> 01:30:25,280
the the carcinogens in
 

5451
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:27,830
the the carcinogens in
in in tobacco it's burning tobacco smoke

5452
01:30:27,830 --> 01:30:27,840
in in tobacco it's burning tobacco smoke
 

5453
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:29,350
in in tobacco it's burning tobacco smoke
it's not the nicotine

5454
01:30:29,350 --> 01:30:29,360
it's not the nicotine
 

5455
01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:33,270
it's not the nicotine
so um that it's not like alcohol

prohibition
 

5459
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,550
prohibition
where like you know you couldn't create

5460
01:30:36,550 --> 01:30:36,560
where like you know you couldn't create
 

5461
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:37,510
where like you know you couldn't create
the adults

5462
01:30:37,510 --> 01:30:37,520

01:31:12,870 --> 01:31:12,880
a lot of confidence that that's going to
 

5503
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:14,390
a lot of confidence that that's going to
be done in a

5504
01:31:14,390 --> 01:31:14,400
be done in a
 

5505
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:17,590
be done in a
thoughtful analytical way and i'm afraid

5506
01:31:17,590 --> 01:31:17,600
thoughtful analytical way and i'm afraid
 

5507
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:19,110
thoughtful analytical way and i'm afraid
that it could

5508
01:31:19,110 --> 01:31:19,120
that it could
 

5509
01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:21,430
that it could
decrease the increase of black market

5510
01:31:21,430 --> 01:31:21,440
decrease the increase of black market
 

5511
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:22,470
decrease the increase of black market
cause all of the

5512
01:31:22,470 --> 01:31:22,480
cause all of the
 

5513
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:24,149
cause all of the
harms like every other drug we're moving

5514
01:31:24,149 --> 01:31:24,159
harms like every other drug we're moving
 

5515
01:31:24,159 --> 01:31:25,990
harms like every other drug we're moving
away from the heavy from

5516
01:31:25,990 --> 01:31:26,000
away from the heavy from
 

5517
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:29,350
away from the heavy from
the prohibition model slowly but the big

5518
01:31:29,350 --> 01:31:29,360
the prohibition model slowly but the big
 

5519
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:30,709
the prohibition model slowly but the big
barge ship is like

5520
01:31:30,709 --> 01:31:30,719
barge ship is like
 

5521
01:31:30,719 --> 01:31:33,669
barge ship is like
making a a very slow turn and like okay

5522
01:31:33,669 --> 01:31:33,679
making a a very slow turn and like okay
 

5523
01:31:33,679 --> 01:31:35,990
making a a very slow turn and like okay
we really had to step back and question

5524
01:31:35,990 --> 01:31:36,000
we really had to step back and question
 

5525
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:39,830
we really had to step back and question
if we went with nicotine tobacco are we

5526
01:31:39,830 --> 01:31:39,840
if we went with nicotine tobacco are we
 

5527
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:42,550
if we went with nicotine tobacco are we
moving into that direction like yeah the

5528
01:31:42,550 --> 01:31:42,560
moving into that direction like yeah the
 

5529
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:43,750
moving into that direction like yeah the
picture

5530
01:31:43,750 --> 01:31:43,760
picture
 

5531
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:46,149
picture
it doesn't quite make sense you uh

5532
01:31:46,149 --> 01:31:46,159
it doesn't quite make sense you uh
 

5533
01:31:46,159 --> 01:31:47,669
it doesn't quite make sense you uh
you've done a study on

5534
01:31:47,669 --> 01:31:47,679
you've done a study on
 

5535
01:31:47,679 --> 01:31:51,669
you've done a study on
cocaine and sexual decision making

5536
01:31:51,669 --> 01:31:51,679
cocaine and sexual decision making
 

5537
01:31:51,679 --> 01:31:55,189
cocaine and sexual decision making
uh can you explain

5538
01:31:55,189 --> 01:31:55,199
uh can you explain
 

5539
01:31:55,199 --> 01:31:58,470
uh can you explain
can you explain the findings i mean in a

5540
01:31:58,470 --> 01:31:58,480
can you explain the findings i mean in a
 

5541
01:31:58,480 --> 01:31:59,189
can you explain the findings i mean in a
broad

5542
01:31:59,189 --> 01:31:59,199
broad
 

5543
01:31:59,199 --> 01:32:03,030
broad
sense how do you do a study

5544
01:32:03,030 --> 01:32:03,040
sense how do you do a study
 

5545
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:07,110
sense how do you do a study
that involves cocaine and

5546
01:32:07,110 --> 01:32:07,120
that involves cocaine and
 

5547
01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:09,270
that involves cocaine and
the other how do you do a study

5548
01:32:09,270 --> 01:32:09,280
the other how do you do a study
 

5549
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:10,550
the other how do you do a study
involving this

5550
01:32:10,550 --> 01:32:10,560
involving this
 

5551
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:13,830
involving this
sexual decision making and then

5552
01:32:13,830 --> 01:32:13,840
sexual decision making and then
 

5553
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:16,550
sexual decision making and then
how do you do a study that combines both

5554
01:32:16,550 --> 01:32:16,560
how do you do a study that combines both
 

5555
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:18,550
how do you do a study that combines both
yeah sex and drugs too i'm just missing

5556
01:32:18,550 --> 01:32:18,560
yeah sex and drugs too i'm just missing
 

5557
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:19,750
yeah sex and drugs too i'm just missing
the rock and roll

5558
01:32:19,750 --> 01:32:19,760
the rock and roll
 

5559
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:21,669
the rock and roll
the two controversial rock and roll

5560
01:32:21,669 --> 01:32:21,679
the two controversial rock and roll
 

5561
01:32:21,679 --> 01:32:23,590
the two controversial rock and roll
isn't very controversial anymore

5562
01:32:23,590 --> 01:32:23,600
isn't very controversial anymore
 

5563
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:25,350
isn't very controversial anymore
yeah so the cocaine you know lots of

5564
01:32:25,350 --> 01:32:25,360
yeah so the cocaine you know lots of
 

5565
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:27,030
yeah so the cocaine you know lots of
hoops to jump through you got to have a

5566
01:32:27,030 --> 01:32:27,040
hoops to jump through you got to have a
 

5567
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:27,830
hoops to jump through you got to have a
lot of medical

5568
01:32:27,830 --> 01:32:27,840
lot of medical
 

5569
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:29,910
lot of medical
support you got to be at a basically an

5570
01:32:29,910 --> 01:32:29,920
support you got to be at a basically an
 

5571
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:31,590
support you got to be at a basically an
institution a research

5572
01:32:31,590 --> 01:32:31,600
institution a research
 

5573
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:34,310
institution a research
unit like i'm at that has a long history

5574
01:32:34,310 --> 01:32:34,320
unit like i'm at that has a long history
 

5575
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:35,270
unit like i'm at that has a long history
and the ability to

5576
01:32:35,270 --> 01:32:35,280
and the ability to
 

5577
01:32:35,280 --> 01:32:38,550
and the ability to
to do that and

5578
01:32:38,550 --> 01:32:38,560
to do that and
 

5579
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:40,790
to do that and
get ethics approval get fda approval but

5580
01:32:40,790 --> 01:32:40,800
get ethics approval get fda approval but
 

5581
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:41,910
get ethics approval get fda approval but
it's possible and

5582
01:32:41,910 --> 01:32:41,920
it's possible and
 

5583
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:43,110
it's possible and
whenever you're dealing with something

5584
01:32:43,110 --> 01:32:43,120
whenever you're dealing with something
 

5585
01:32:43,120 --> 01:32:44,470
whenever you're dealing with something
like cocaine you would never want to

5586
01:32:44,470 --> 01:32:44,480
like cocaine you would never want to
 

5587
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:46,149
like cocaine you would never want to
give that to a

5588
01:32:46,149 --> 01:32:46,159
give that to a
 

5589
01:32:46,159 --> 01:32:48,229
give that to a
not someone who hasn't already used

5590
01:32:48,229 --> 01:32:48,239
not someone who hasn't already used
 

5591
01:32:48,239 --> 01:32:50,229
not someone who hasn't already used
cocaine and you want to make sure you're

5592
01:32:50,229 --> 01:32:50,239
cocaine and you want to make sure you're
 

5593
01:32:50,239 --> 01:32:51,669
cocaine and you want to make sure you're
not giving it to someone who's an active

5594
01:32:51,669 --> 01:32:51,679
not giving it to someone who's an active
 

5595
01:32:51,679 --> 01:32:53,189
not giving it to someone who's an active
user who wants to quit

5596
01:32:53,189 --> 01:32:53,199
user who wants to quit
 

5597
01:32:53,199 --> 01:32:55,430
user who wants to quit
so the idea is like okay if you're if

5598
01:32:55,430 --> 01:32:55,440
so the idea is like okay if you're if
 

5599
01:32:55,440 --> 01:32:57,110
so the idea is like okay if you're if
you're using this type of drug anyway

5600
01:32:57,110 --> 01:32:57,120
you're using this type of drug anyway
 

5601
01:32:57,120 --> 01:32:59,110
you're using this type of drug anyway
and you're we're really sure you're not

5602
01:32:59,110 --> 01:32:59,120
and you're we're really sure you're not
 

5603
01:32:59,120 --> 01:33:00,390
and you're we're really sure you're not
looking to quit

5604
01:33:00,390 --> 01:33:00,400
looking to quit
 

5605
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:03,669
looking to quit
hey use use a couple times in the lab

5606
01:33:03,669 --> 01:33:03,679
hey use use a couple times in the lab
 

5607
01:33:03,679 --> 01:33:04,950
hey use use a couple times in the lab
with us so we can at least learn

5608
01:33:04,950 --> 01:33:04,960
with us so we can at least learn
 

5609
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:07,590
with us so we can at least learn
something and part of what we learn is

5610
01:33:07,590 --> 01:33:07,600
something and part of what we learn is
 

5611
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:08,950
something and part of what we learn is
maybe to help people not use

5612
01:33:08,950 --> 01:33:08,960
maybe to help people not use
 

5613
01:33:08,960 --> 01:33:11,910
maybe to help people not use
and it'll reduce the harms of of cocaine

5614
01:33:11,910 --> 01:33:11,920
and it'll reduce the harms of of cocaine
 

5615
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:12,470
and it'll reduce the harms of of cocaine
so

5616
01:33:12,470 --> 01:33:12,480
so
 

5617
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:14,550
so
there's hoops to jump through with the

5618
01:33:14,550 --> 01:33:14,560
there's hoops to jump through with the
 

5619
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:15,750
there's hoops to jump through with the
sexual um

5620
01:33:15,750 --> 01:33:15,760
sexual um
 

5621
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:17,430
sexual um
decision making i looked at the main

5622
01:33:17,430 --> 01:33:17,440
decision making i looked at the main
 

5623
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:19,910
decision making i looked at the main
thing i looked at was this model of

5624
01:33:19,910 --> 01:33:19,920
thing i looked at was this model of
 

5625
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:22,229
thing i looked at was this model of
i applied delayed discounting to what we

5626
01:33:22,229 --> 01:33:22,239
i applied delayed discounting to what we
 

5627
01:33:22,239 --> 01:33:23,830
i applied delayed discounting to what we
talked about earlier than now versus

5628
01:33:23,830 --> 01:33:23,840
talked about earlier than now versus
 

5629
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:24,310
talked about earlier than now versus
later

5630
01:33:24,310 --> 01:33:24,320
later
 

5631
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:26,070
later
that kind of decision-making that goes

5632
01:33:26,070 --> 01:33:26,080
that kind of decision-making that goes
 

5633
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:27,830
that kind of decision-making that goes
along with addiction i applied that to

5634
01:33:27,830 --> 01:33:27,840
along with addiction i applied that to
 

5635
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:29,510
along with addiction i applied that to
condom use decisions

5636
01:33:29,510 --> 01:33:29,520
condom use decisions
 

5637
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:32,229
condom use decisions
um and and i've done probably published

5638
01:33:32,229 --> 01:33:32,239
um and and i've done probably published
 

5639
01:33:32,239 --> 01:33:34,070
um and and i've done probably published
about 20 or so papers with this and

5640
01:33:34,070 --> 01:33:34,080
about 20 or so papers with this and
 

5641
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:35,510
about 20 or so papers with this and
different drugs and

5642
01:33:35,510 --> 01:33:35,520
different drugs and
 

5643
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:38,229
different drugs and
and uh so the the primary metric is

5644
01:33:38,229 --> 01:33:38,239
and uh so the the primary metric is
 

5645
01:33:38,239 --> 01:33:39,910
and uh so the the primary metric is
whether you do or don't use a condom

5646
01:33:39,910 --> 01:33:39,920
whether you do or don't use a condom
 

5647
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:40,790
whether you do or don't use a condom
that's the most right

5648
01:33:40,790 --> 01:33:40,800
that's the most right
 

5649
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:42,390
that's the most right
oh hypothetical so this is using

5650
01:33:42,390 --> 01:33:42,400
oh hypothetical so this is using
 

5651
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:44,070
oh hypothetical so this is using
hypothetical decision making but i

5652
01:33:44,070 --> 01:33:44,080
hypothetical decision making but i
 

5653
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:45,189
hypothetical decision making but i
published

5654
01:33:45,189 --> 01:33:45,199
published
 

5655
01:33:45,199 --> 01:33:48,149

01:33:54,639 --> 01:33:57,990
studies to self-reported behavior
so this is like so like how do you did

5664
01:33:57,990 --> 01:33:58,000
so this is like so like how do you did
 

5665
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,750
so this is like so like how do you did
you do a questionnaire kind of thing

5666
01:33:59,750 --> 01:33:59,760
you do a questionnaire kind of thing
 

5667
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:01,510
you do a questionnaire kind of thing
right so it's a it's not quite a

5668
01:34:01,510 --> 01:34:01,520
right so it's a it's not quite a
 

5669
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:03,830
right so it's a it's not quite a
questionnaire but but it's a it's it's a

5670
01:34:03,830 --> 01:34:03,840
questionnaire but but it's a it's it's a
 

5671
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:06,149
questionnaire but but it's a it's it's a
it's a behavioral task

5672
01:34:06,149 --> 01:34:06,159
it's a behavioral task
 

5673
01:34:06,159 --> 01:34:08,950
it's a behavioral task
requiring them to to respond to so you

5674
01:34:08,950 --> 01:34:08,960
requiring them to to respond to so you
 

5675
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:11,430
requiring them to to respond to so you
show pictures of a bunch of individuals

5676
01:34:11,430 --> 01:34:11,440
show pictures of a bunch of individuals
 

5677
01:34:11,440 --> 01:34:12,870
show pictures of a bunch of individuals
and it's it's kind of like one of these

5678
01:34:12,870 --> 01:34:12,880
and it's it's kind of like one of these
 

5679
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:14,310
and it's it's kind of like one of these
fun behavioral like a lot of them you

5680
01:34:14,310 --> 01:34:14,320
fun behavioral like a lot of them you
 

5681
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:15,030
fun behavioral like a lot of them you
get like

5682
01:34:15,030 --> 01:34:15,040
get like
 

5683
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:16,950
get like
numbers are born but it's like okay hot

5684
01:34:16,950 --> 01:34:16,960
numbers are born but it's like okay hot
 

5685
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:18,550
numbers are born but it's like okay hot
or not like which of these 60 people

5686
01:34:18,550 --> 01:34:18,560
or not like which of these 60 people
 

5687
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:20,470
or not like which of these 60 people
would you have a one night stand with

5688
01:34:20,470 --> 01:34:20,480
would you have a one night stand with
 

5689
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:22,390
would you have a one night stand with
men women so pick whatever you like yeah

5690
01:34:22,390 --> 01:34:22,400
men women so pick whatever you like yeah
 

5691
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:23,189
men women so pick whatever you like yeah
a little bit of this a little bit of

5692
01:34:23,189 --> 01:34:23,199
a little bit of this a little bit of
 

5693
01:34:23,199 --> 01:34:25,189
a little bit of this a little bit of
that whatever you're into it's all

5694
01:34:25,189 --> 01:34:25,199
that whatever you're into it's all
 

5695
01:34:25,199 --> 01:34:27,910
that whatever you're into it's all
variety there out of that group you pick

5696
01:34:27,910 --> 01:34:27,920
variety there out of that group you pick
 

5697
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:29,590
variety there out of that group you pick
some subsets of people who you think is

5698
01:34:29,590 --> 01:34:29,600
some subsets of people who you think is
 

5699
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:29,910
some subsets of people who you think is
the

5700
01:34:29,910 --> 01:34:29,920
the
 

5701
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:31,350
the
you know the one you most want to have

5702
01:34:31,350 --> 01:34:31,360
you know the one you most want to have
 

5703
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:33,110
you know the one you most want to have
sex with the least he thinks most likely

5704
01:34:33,110 --> 01:34:33,120
sex with the least he thinks most likely
 

5705
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:34,390
sex with the least he thinks most likely
have an sti or at least

5706
01:34:34,390 --> 01:34:34,400
have an sti or at least

sti
 

5711
01:34:37,679 --> 01:34:40,550
sti
and then you could do certain decision

5712
01:34:40,550 --> 01:34:40,560
and then you could do certain decision
 

5713
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:42,470
and then you could do certain decision
making questions so what i've done is

5714
01:34:42,470 --> 01:34:42,480
making questions so what i've done is
 

5715
01:34:42,480 --> 01:34:43,669
making questions so what i've done is
asked

5716
01:34:43,669 --> 01:34:43,679
asked
 

5717
01:34:43,679 --> 01:34:45,189
asked
say this percy read a vignette this

5718
01:34:45,189 --> 01:34:45,199
say this percy read a vignette this
 

5719
01:34:45,199 --> 01:34:46,310
say this percy read a vignette this
person wants to have sex with you now

person wants to have sex with you now
 

5721
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:47,910
person wants to have sex with you now
you've met them to get along

5722
01:34:47,910 --> 01:34:47,920
you've met them to get along
 

5723
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:50,470
you've met them to get along
um casual sex scenario like a one-night

5724
01:34:50,470 --> 01:34:50,480
um casual sex scenario like a one-night
 

5725
01:34:50,480 --> 01:34:51,109
um casual sex scenario like a one-night
stand

5726
01:34:51,109 --> 01:34:51,119
stand

stand
with a condom's available just rate your

5728
01:34:53,350 --> 01:34:53,360
with a condom's available just rate your
 

5729
01:34:53,360 --> 01:34:55,030
with a condom's available just rate your
likelihood from 1-100 on

5730
01:34:55,030 --> 01:34:55,040
likelihood from 1-100 on
 

5731
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:57,510
likelihood from 1-100 on
this kind of scale would you use it but

5732
01:34:57,510 --> 01:34:57,520
this kind of scale would you use it but
 

5733
01:34:57,520 --> 01:34:58,709
this kind of scale would you use it but
then you can change your

5734
01:34:58,709 --> 01:34:58,719
then you can change your
 

5735
01:34:58,719 --> 01:35:00,390
then you can change your
your scenario to say okay now imagine

5736
01:35:00,390 --> 01:35:00,400
your scenario to say okay now imagine
 

5737
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:01,910
your scenario to say okay now imagine
you have to wait five minutes to use a

5738
01:35:01,910 --> 01:35:01,920
you have to wait five minutes to use a
 

5739
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:02,790
you have to wait five minutes to use a
condom

5740
01:35:02,790 --> 01:35:02,800
condom
 

5741
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:04,310
condom
so the the choice is now instead of

5742
01:35:04,310 --> 01:35:04,320
so the the choice is now instead of
 

5743
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:06,070
so the the choice is now instead of
using condom versus not in terms of your

5744
01:35:06,070 --> 01:35:06,080
using condom versus not in terms of your
 

5745
01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:07,750
using condom versus not in terms of your
likelihood scale

5746
01:35:07,750 --> 01:35:07,760
likelihood scale
 

5747
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:10,390
likelihood scale
it now it ranges from um have sex now

5748
01:35:10,390 --> 01:35:10,400
it now it ranges from um have sex now
 

5749
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:11,830
it now it ranges from um have sex now
without a condom

5750
01:35:11,830 --> 01:35:11,840
without a condom
 

5751
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:13,910
without a condom
versus on the other end of the scale is

5752
01:35:13,910 --> 01:35:13,920
versus on the other end of the scale is
 

5753
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:15,910
versus on the other end of the scale is
wait five minutes to have sex with a

5754
01:35:15,910 --> 01:35:15,920
wait five minutes to have sex with a
 

5755
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:17,430
wait five minutes to have sex with a
condom so you rate your likelihood

5756
01:35:17,430 --> 01:35:17,440
condom so you rate your likelihood
 

5757
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:19,430
condom so you rate your likelihood
of where your behavior would be along

5758
01:35:19,430 --> 01:35:19,440
of where your behavior would be along
 

5759
01:35:19,440 --> 01:35:20,870
of where your behavior would be along
that continuum and then you could say

5760
01:35:20,870 --> 01:35:20,880
that continuum and then you could say
 

5761
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:22,550
that continuum and then you could say
okay well what about an hour

5762
01:35:22,550 --> 01:35:22,560
okay well what about an hour
 

5763
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:24,229
okay well what about an hour
what about three hours what about you

5764
01:35:24,229 --> 01:35:24,239
what about three hours what about you
 

5765
01:35:24,239 --> 01:35:25,590
what about three hours what about you
know what about 24 hours

5766
01:35:25,590 --> 01:35:25,600
know what about 24 hours
 

5767
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:29,189
know what about 24 hours
i'm misunderstanding uh

5768
01:35:29,189 --> 01:35:29,199
i'm misunderstanding uh
 

5769
01:35:29,199 --> 01:35:31,590
i'm misunderstanding uh
now without a condom or five minutes

5770
01:35:31,590 --> 01:35:31,600
now without a condom or five minutes
 

5771
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:32,709
now without a condom or five minutes
later with a condom

5772
01:35:32,709 --> 01:35:32,719
later with a condom
 

5773
01:35:32,719 --> 01:35:35,750
later with a condom
right isn't the so what

5774
01:35:35,750 --> 01:35:35,760
right isn't the so what
 

5775
01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:38,229
right isn't the so what
what's supposed to be the preference for

5776
01:35:38,229 --> 01:35:38,239
what's supposed to be the preference for
 

5777
01:35:38,239 --> 01:35:39,910
what's supposed to be the preference for
the person

5778
01:35:39,910 --> 01:35:39,920
the person
 

5779
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:42,310
the person
like is like what like there's a lot of

5780
01:35:42,310 --> 01:35:42,320
like is like what like there's a lot of
 

5781
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:44,070
like is like what like there's a lot of
factors coming into play right there's

5782
01:35:44,070 --> 01:35:44,080
factors coming into play right there's
 

5783
01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:45,109
factors coming into play right there's
like

5784
01:35:45,109 --> 01:35:45,119
like
 

5785
01:35:45,119 --> 01:35:48,310
like
uh like there's like pleasure and

5786
01:35:48,310 --> 01:35:48,320
uh like there's like pleasure and
 

5787
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:49,910
uh like there's like pleasure and
personal preference and then there's

5788
01:35:49,910 --> 01:35:49,920
personal preference and then there's
 

5789
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:51,350
personal preference and then there's
also the safety

5790
01:35:51,350 --> 01:35:51,360
also the safety
 

5791
01:35:51,360 --> 01:35:54,070
also the safety
those are two like are those competing

5792
01:35:54,070 --> 01:35:54,080
those are two like are those competing
 

5793
01:35:54,080 --> 01:35:55,189
those are two like are those competing
objectives

5794
01:35:55,189 --> 01:35:55,199
objectives
 

5795
01:35:55,199 --> 01:35:57,189
objectives
right and so we do get at that through

5796
01:35:57,189 --> 01:35:57,199
right and so we do get at that through
 

5797
01:35:57,199 --> 01:35:59,189
right and so we do get at that through
some individual measures and and this

5798
01:35:59,189 --> 01:35:59,199
some individual measures and and this
 

5799
01:35:59,199 --> 01:36:01,109
some individual measures and and this
task is more of a face valid task where

5800
01:36:01,109 --> 01:36:01,119
task is more of a face valid task where
 

5801
01:36:01,119 --> 01:36:02,550
task is more of a face valid task where
there's a lot underneath the hood

5802
01:36:02,550 --> 01:36:02,560
there's a lot underneath the hood
 

5803
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:05,669
there's a lot underneath the hood
so for most people sex with the condom

5804
01:36:05,669 --> 01:36:05,679
so for most people sex with the condom
 

5805
01:36:05,679 --> 01:36:07,350
so for most people sex with the condom
is the better reward

5806
01:36:07,350 --> 01:36:07,360
is the better reward
 

5807
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:09,990
is the better reward
but underneath the hood of that is just

5808
01:36:09,990 --> 01:36:10,000
but underneath the hood of that is just
 

5809
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:11,510
but underneath the hood of that is just
at the purely physical level they'd

5810
01:36:11,510 --> 01:36:11,520
at the purely physical level they'd
 

5811
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:12,390
at the purely physical level they'd
rather have sex

5812
01:36:12,390 --> 01:36:12,400
rather have sex
 

5813
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:13,750
rather have sex
with without the condom it's going to

5814
01:36:13,750 --> 01:36:13,760
with without the condom it's going to
 

5815
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:16,149
with without the condom it's going to
feel bad what do you mean by reward like

5816
01:36:16,149 --> 01:36:16,159
feel bad what do you mean by reward like
 

5817
01:36:16,159 --> 01:36:18,550
feel bad what do you mean by reward like
when they calculate their trajectory

5818
01:36:18,550 --> 01:36:18,560
when they calculate their trajectory
 

5819
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:19,590
when they calculate their trajectory
through life

5820
01:36:19,590 --> 01:36:19,600
through life
 

5821
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:22,790
through life
and try to optimize it then sex with the

5822
01:36:22,790 --> 01:36:22,800
and try to optimize it then sex with the
 

5823
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:24,310
and try to optimize it then sex with the
condom is a good idea

5824
01:36:24,310 --> 01:36:24,320
condom is a good idea
 

5825
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:26,790
condom is a good idea
well it's it's it's it's really based on

5826
01:36:26,790 --> 01:36:26,800
well it's it's it's it's really based on
 

5827
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:27,430
well it's it's it's it's really based on
i mean yeah

5828
01:36:27,430 --> 01:36:27,440
i mean yeah
 

5829
01:36:27,440 --> 01:36:29,189
i mean yeah
yeah presumably that's the case that

5830
01:36:29,189 --> 01:36:29,199
yeah presumably that's the case that
 

5831
01:36:29,199 --> 01:36:31,430
yeah presumably that's the case that
that that there's

5832
01:36:31,430 --> 01:36:31,440
that that there's
 

5833
01:36:31,440 --> 01:36:33,030
that that there's
but it's measured by like what would

5834
01:36:33,030 --> 01:36:33,040
but it's measured by like what would
 

5835
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:34,310
but it's measured by like what would
really that first question where there

5836
01:36:34,310 --> 01:36:34,320
really that first question where there
 

5837
01:36:34,320 --> 01:36:35,350
really that first question where there
is no delay

5838
01:36:35,350 --> 01:36:35,360
is no delay
 

5839
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:37,109
is no delay
most people say they would be at the

5840
01:36:37,109 --> 01:36:37,119
most people say they would be at the
 

5841
01:36:37,119 --> 01:36:38,629
most people say they would be at the
higher net scale a lot of times 100

5842
01:36:38,629 --> 01:36:38,639
higher net scale a lot of times 100
 

5843
01:36:38,639 --> 01:36:39,830
higher net scale a lot of times 100
percent they said they would definitely

5844
01:36:39,830 --> 01:36:39,840
percent they said they would definitely
 

5845
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:40,229
percent they said they would definitely
use

5846
01:36:40,229 --> 01:36:40,239
use
 

5847
01:36:40,239 --> 01:36:42,550
use
use economy a condom not everybody and

use economy a condom not everybody and
 

5849
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:43,990
use economy a condom not everybody and
that we know that's the case see it's

5850
01:36:43,990 --> 01:36:44,000
that we know that's the case see it's
 

5851
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:44,310
that we know that's the case see it's
like

5852
01:36:44,310 --> 01:36:44,320
like
 

5853
01:36:44,320 --> 01:36:45,990
like
that that some people don't like com

5854
01:36:45,990 --> 01:36:46,000
that that some people don't like com
 

5855

some people say yeah i i want to use a
 

5857
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:49,270
some people say yeah i i want to use a
condom but

condom but
 

5859
01:36:49,280 --> 01:36:50,550
condom but
you know a quarter of the time ended up

5860
01:36:50,550 --> 01:36:50,560
you know a quarter of the time ended up
 

5861
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:52,149
you know a quarter of the time ended up
not because i guess getting lost in the

5862
01:36:52,149 --> 01:36:52,159
not because i guess getting lost in the
 

5863
01:36:52,159 --> 01:36:53,750
not because i guess getting lost in the
passion of the moment

that people
 

5869
01:36:56,800 --> 01:36:59,030
that people
so behaviorally speaking at least for a

so behaviorally speaking at least for a
 

5871
01:36:59,040 --> 01:37:00,229
so behaviorally speaking at least for a
large number of people in many

large number of people in many
 

5873
01:37:00,239 --> 01:37:02,390
large number of people in many
circumstances condom use is a reinforcer

5874
01:37:02,390 --> 01:37:02,400
circumstances condom use is a reinforcer
 

5875
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:03,910
circumstances condom use is a reinforcer
just because people do it

5876
01:37:03,910 --> 01:37:03,920
just because people do it
 

5877
01:37:03,920 --> 01:37:06,950
just because people do it
like you know why are they doing it

5878
01:37:06,950 --> 01:37:06,960
like you know why are they doing it
 

5879
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:08,790
like you know why are they doing it
they're not because it makes the sex

5880
01:37:08,790 --> 01:37:08,800
they're not because it makes the sex
 

5881
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:09,990
they're not because it makes the sex
feel better

feel better
 

5883
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,709
feel better
but because it makes that it allows for

5884
01:37:12,709 --> 01:37:12,719
but because it makes that it allows for
 

5885
01:37:12,719 --> 01:37:14,070
but because it makes that it allows for
at least the same

at least the same

it feels a little bit not as good

5890
01:37:17,510 --> 01:37:17,520
it feels a little bit not as good
 

5891
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:19,270
it feels a little bit not as good
yeah you know with the condom

5892
01:37:19,270 --> 01:37:19,280
yeah you know with the condom
 

5893
01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:21,910
yeah you know with the condom
nonetheless they get most of the benefit

5894
01:37:21,910 --> 01:37:21,920
nonetheless they get most of the benefit
 

5895
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:25,510
nonetheless they get most of the benefit
without the concurrent oh my gosh

5896
01:37:25,510 --> 01:37:25,520
without the concurrent oh my gosh
 

5897
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:27,109
without the concurrent oh my gosh
there's this risk of either unwanted

5898
01:37:27,109 --> 01:37:27,119
there's this risk of either unwanted
 

5899
01:37:27,119 --> 01:37:28,950
there's this risk of either unwanted
pregnancy or getting hiv

5900
01:37:28,950 --> 01:37:28,960
pregnancy or getting hiv
 

5901
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:31,910
pregnancy or getting hiv
or way more likely than hiv you know

5902
01:37:31,910 --> 01:37:31,920
or way more likely than hiv you know
 

5903
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:32,709
or way more likely than hiv you know
herpes

5904
01:37:32,709 --> 01:37:32,719
herpes
 

5905
01:37:32,719 --> 01:37:34,870
herpes
you know in general awards etcetera all

5906
01:37:34,870 --> 01:37:34,880
you know in general awards etcetera all
 

5907
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:36,229
you know in general awards etcetera all
the all the lovely ones

5908
01:37:36,229 --> 01:37:36,239
the all the lovely ones
 

5909
01:37:36,239 --> 01:37:38,310
the all the lovely ones
um and we've actually done research

5910
01:37:38,310 --> 01:37:38,320
um and we've actually done research
 

5911
01:37:38,320 --> 01:37:39,350
um and we've actually done research
saying like where we

5912
01:37:39,350 --> 01:37:39,360
saying like where we
 

5913
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:40,550
saying like where we
gauge the probability of these

5914
01:37:40,550 --> 01:37:40,560
gauge the probability of these
 

5915
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:42,550
gauge the probability of these
individual s different sdi's and it's

5916
01:37:42,550 --> 01:37:42,560
individual s different sdi's and it's
 

5917
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:44,390
individual s different sdi's and it's
like what's the heavy hitter in terms of

5918
01:37:44,390 --> 01:37:44,400
like what's the heavy hitter in terms of
 

5919
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:46,870
like what's the heavy hitter in terms of
what people are using to judge you know

5920
01:37:46,870 --> 01:37:46,880
what people are using to judge you know
 

5921
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:48,070
what people are using to judge you know
to evaluate they're going to use a

5922
01:37:48,070 --> 01:37:48,080
to evaluate they're going to use a
 

5923
01:37:48,080 --> 01:37:49,109
to evaluate they're going to use a
condom

5924
01:37:49,109 --> 01:37:49,119
condom
 

5925
01:37:49,119 --> 01:37:51,350
condom
so that's why the condom use is the

5926
01:37:51,350 --> 01:37:51,360
so that's why the condom use is the
 

5927
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:54,070
so that's why the condom use is the
delayed thing five minutes or more

5928
01:37:54,070 --> 01:37:54,080
delayed thing five minutes or more
 

5929
01:37:54,080 --> 01:37:56,550
delayed thing five minutes or more
and then uh yeah because it would

5930
01:37:56,550 --> 01:37:56,560
and then uh yeah because it would
 

5931
01:37:56,560 --> 01:37:58,310
and then uh yeah because it would
normally be the larger later reward like

5932
01:37:58,310 --> 01:37:58,320
normally be the larger later reward like
 

5933
01:37:58,320 --> 01:38:00,070
normally be the larger later reward like
the ten dollars versus the nine it's

5934
01:38:00,070 --> 01:38:00,080
the ten dollars versus the nine it's
 

5935
01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:01,350
the ten dollars versus the nine it's
like the ten dollar which is

5936
01:38:01,350 --> 01:38:01,360
like the ten dollar which is
 

5937
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:02,870
like the ten dollar which is
counterintuitive if you just think about

5938
01:38:02,870 --> 01:38:02,880
counterintuitive if you just think about
 

5939
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:05,270
counterintuitive if you just think about
the physical pleasure so that's a good

5940
01:38:05,270 --> 01:38:05,280
the physical pleasure so that's a good
 

5941
01:38:05,280 --> 01:38:07,510
the physical pleasure so that's a good
that's a good thing to measure so condom

5942
01:38:07,510 --> 01:38:07,520
that's a good thing to measure so condom
 

5943
01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:09,510
that's a good thing to measure so condom
use is a really good concrete quantity

5944
01:38:09,510 --> 01:38:09,520
use is a really good concrete quantity
 

5945
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:12,629
use is a really good concrete quantity
quantitative quantifiable thing that you

5946
01:38:12,629 --> 01:38:12,639
quantitative quantifiable thing that you
 

5947
01:38:12,639 --> 01:38:14,229
quantitative quantifiable thing that you
can use in a study and then you can add

5948
01:38:14,229 --> 01:38:14,239
can use in a study and then you can add
 

5949
01:38:14,239 --> 01:38:16,629
can use in a study and then you can add
a lot of different elements like

5950
01:38:16,629 --> 01:38:16,639
a lot of different elements like
 

5951
01:38:16,639 --> 01:38:18,390
a lot of different elements like
the presence of cocaine and so on yeah

5952
01:38:18,390 --> 01:38:18,400
the presence of cocaine and so on yeah
 

5953
01:38:18,400 --> 01:38:19,750
the presence of cocaine and so on yeah
you can get people loaded on

5954
01:38:19,750 --> 01:38:19,760
you can get people loaded on
 

5955
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:21,510
you can get people loaded on
like any number of drugs like cocaine

5956
01:38:21,510 --> 01:38:21,520
like any number of drugs like cocaine
 

5957
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:22,950
like any number of drugs like cocaine
alcohol and methamphetamine are the

5958
01:38:22,950 --> 01:38:22,960
alcohol and methamphetamine are the
 

5959
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:24,790
alcohol and methamphetamine are the
three that i've done and published on

5960
01:38:24,790 --> 01:38:24,800
three that i've done and published on
 

5961
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:27,590
three that i've done and published on
and it's interesting that these are fun

5962
01:38:27,590 --> 01:38:27,600
and it's interesting that these are fun
 

5963
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:28,310
and it's interesting that these are fun
studies

5964
01:38:28,310 --> 01:38:28,320
studies
 

5965
01:38:28,320 --> 01:38:30,870
studies
man right i love to get people loaded in

5966
01:38:30,870 --> 01:38:30,880
man right i love to get people loaded in
 

5967
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:33,430
man right i love to get people loaded in
in a safe context and like but to really

5968
01:38:33,430 --> 01:38:33,440
in a safe context and like but to really
 

5969
01:38:33,440 --> 01:38:34,709
in a safe context and like but to really
it started like there was some early

5970
01:38:34,709 --> 01:38:34,719
it started like there was some early
 

5971
01:38:34,719 --> 01:38:37,030
it started like there was some early
research alcohol i mean the psychedelics

5972
01:38:37,030 --> 01:38:37,040
research alcohol i mean the psychedelics
 

5973
01:38:37,040 --> 01:38:38,629
research alcohol i mean the psychedelics
are the most interesting but it's like

5974
01:38:38,629 --> 01:38:38,639
are the most interesting but it's like
 

5975
01:38:38,639 --> 01:38:40,390
are the most interesting but it's like
all of these drugs are fascinating the

5976
01:38:40,390 --> 01:38:40,400
all of these drugs are fascinating the
 

5977
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:42,310
all of these drugs are fascinating the
fact that all these are keys that

5978
01:38:42,310 --> 01:38:42,320
fact that all these are keys that
 

5979
01:38:42,320 --> 01:38:44,550
fact that all these are keys that
unlock a certain like psychological

5980
01:38:44,550 --> 01:38:44,560

experience in
 

5983
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:47,669
experience in
in the head and so there was this work

5984
01:38:47,669 --> 01:38:47,679
in the head and so there was this work
 

5985
01:38:47,679 --> 01:38:49,510
in the head and so there was this work
with alcohol that showed that it didn't

5986
01:38:49,510 --> 01:38:49,520
with alcohol that showed that it didn't
 

5987
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:51,350
with alcohol that showed that it didn't
affect those monetary

5988
01:38:51,350 --> 01:38:51,360
affect those monetary
 

5989
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:53,109
affect those monetary

nine dollars now versus ten dollars

5992
01:38:54,550 --> 01:38:54,560
nine dollars now versus ten dollars
 

5993
01:38:54,560 --> 01:38:56,070
nine dollars now versus ten dollars
later and i'm like

later and i'm like
 

5995

later and i'm like
getting people drunk and i thought to

5996
01:38:57,590 --> 01:38:57,600
getting people drunk and i thought to
 

5997
01:38:57,600 --> 01:38:59,750
getting people drunk and i thought to
myself are you telling me

5998
01:38:59,750 --> 01:38:59,760
myself are you telling me
 

5999
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:02,629
myself are you telling me
that that you know getting someone that

6000
01:39:02,629 --> 01:39:02,639
that that you know getting someone that
 

6001
01:39:02,639 --> 01:39:03,750
that that you know getting someone that
people being drunk

6002
01:39:03,750 --> 01:39:03,760
people being drunk
 

6003
01:39:03,760 --> 01:39:05,590
people being drunk
is does not cause people at least

6004
01:39:05,590 --> 01:39:05,600
is does not cause people at least
 

6005
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:07,590
is does not cause people at least
sometimes to make

6006
01:39:07,590 --> 01:39:07,600
sometimes to make
 

6007
01:39:07,600 --> 01:39:10,070
sometimes to make
to choose what's good for them in the

6008
01:39:10,070 --> 01:39:10,080
to choose what's good for them in the
 

6009
01:39:10,080 --> 01:39:10,709
to choose what's good for them in the
short term

6010
01:39:10,709 --> 01:39:10,719
short term
 

6011
01:39:10,719 --> 01:39:12,070
short term
at the expense of what's good for them

6012
01:39:12,070 --> 01:39:12,080
at the expense of what's good for them
 

6013
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:13,990
at the expense of what's good for them
to uh yeah in the long term it's like

6014
01:39:13,990 --> 01:39:14,000
to uh yeah in the long term it's like
 

6015
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:15,669
to uh yeah in the long term it's like
you know [\h__\h] you know like yeah we

6016
01:39:15,669 --> 01:39:15,679
you know [\h__\h] you know like yeah we
 

6017
01:39:15,679 --> 01:39:16,550
you know [\h__\h] you know like yeah we
see it like

6018
01:39:16,550 --> 01:39:16,560
see it like
 

6019
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:19,350
see it like
but in what context does that happen so

6020
01:39:19,350 --> 01:39:19,360
but in what context does that happen so
 

6021
01:39:19,360 --> 01:39:20,229
but in what context does that happen so
that's what

6022
01:39:20,229 --> 01:39:20,239
that's what
 

6023
01:39:20,239 --> 01:39:21,910
that's what
that's something that inspired me to go

6024
01:39:21,910 --> 01:39:21,920
that's something that inspired me to go
 

6025
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:23,350
that's something that inspired me to go
in this direction of like

6026
01:39:23,350 --> 01:39:23,360
in this direction of like
 

6027
01:39:23,360 --> 01:39:25,830
in this direction of like
aha risky sexual decisions is something

6028
01:39:25,830 --> 01:39:25,840
aha risky sexual decisions is something
 

6029
01:39:25,840 --> 01:39:26,950
aha risky sexual decisions is something
they do when they're drunk

6030
01:39:26,950 --> 01:39:26,960
they do when they're drunk
 

6031
01:39:26,960 --> 01:39:28,790
they do when they're drunk
they don't necessarily go home and and

6032
01:39:28,790 --> 01:39:28,800
they don't necessarily go home and and
 

6033
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:30,070
they don't necessarily go home and and
even though some people have gambling

6034
01:39:30,070 --> 01:39:30,080
even though some people have gambling
 

6035
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:30,790
even though some people have gambling
problems and

6036
01:39:30,790 --> 01:39:30,800
problems and
 

6037
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:32,070
problems and
alcohol interacts with that the most

6038
01:39:32,070 --> 01:39:32,080
alcohol interacts with that the most
 

6039
01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:33,430
alcohol interacts with that the most
typical thing is not for people to go

6040
01:39:33,430 --> 01:39:33,440
typical thing is not for people to go
 

6041
01:39:33,440 --> 01:39:34,390
typical thing is not for people to go
home

6042
01:39:34,390 --> 01:39:34,400
home
 

6043
01:39:34,400 --> 01:39:36,229
home
and log on and change their their

6044
01:39:36,229 --> 01:39:36,239
and log on and change their their
 

6045
01:39:36,239 --> 01:39:37,990
and log on and change their their
allocation in their retirement account

6046
01:39:37,990 --> 01:39:38,000
allocation in their retirement account
 

6047
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,310
allocation in their retirement account
or something like that you know like but

6048
01:39:40,310 --> 01:39:40,320
or something like that you know like but
 

6049
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:41,910
or something like that you know like but
but they're more likely risky sexual

6050
01:39:41,910 --> 01:39:41,920
but they're more likely risky sexual
 

6051
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:43,510
but they're more likely risky sexual
decisions they're more likely to not

6052
01:39:43,510 --> 01:39:43,520
decisions they're more likely to not
 

6053
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:45,510
decisions they're more likely to not
wait the five minutes for the condom

6054
01:39:45,510 --> 01:39:45,520
wait the five minutes for the condom
 

6055
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:48,550
wait the five minutes for the condom
right instead go no condom no right

6056
01:39:48,550 --> 01:39:48,560
right instead go no condom no right
 

6057
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:50,709
right instead go no condom no right
that's a big effect and we see that

6058
01:39:50,709 --> 01:39:50,719
that's a big effect and we see that
 

6059
01:39:50,719 --> 01:39:53,270
that's a big effect and we see that
and interestingly we do not see with

6060
01:39:53,270 --> 01:39:53,280
and interestingly we do not see with
 

6061
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:54,070
and interestingly we do not see with
those different drugs

6062
01:39:54,070 --> 01:39:54,080
those different drugs
 

6063
01:39:54,080 --> 01:39:55,750
those different drugs
we don't see an effect if we just look

6064
01:39:55,750 --> 01:39:55,760
we don't see an effect if we just look
 

6065
01:39:55,760 --> 01:39:57,350
we don't see an effect if we just look
at that zero delay condition in other

6066
01:39:57,350 --> 01:39:57,360
at that zero delay condition in other
 

6067
01:39:57,360 --> 01:39:58,790
at that zero delay condition in other
words the condoms right there waiting to

6068
01:39:58,790 --> 01:39:58,800
words the condoms right there waiting to
 

6069
01:39:58,800 --> 01:39:59,590
words the condoms right there waiting to
be used would you

6070
01:39:59,590 --> 01:39:59,600
be used would you
 

6071
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:01,189
be used would you
how likely are to use it you don't see

6072
01:40:01,189 --> 01:40:01,199
how likely are to use it you don't see
 

6073
01:40:01,199 --> 01:40:02,950
how likely are to use it you don't see
it i mean people

6074
01:40:02,950 --> 01:40:02,960
it i mean people
 

6075
01:40:02,960 --> 01:40:04,550
it i mean people
people are by and large gonna use the

6076
01:40:04,550 --> 01:40:04,560
people are by and large gonna use the
 

6077
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:06,070
people are by and large gonna use the
condom yeah so

6078
01:40:06,070 --> 01:40:06,080
condom yeah so
 

6079
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:07,910
condom yeah so
and that's the way most of this research

6080
01:40:07,910 --> 01:40:07,920
and that's the way most of this research
 

6081
01:40:07,920 --> 01:40:09,510
and that's the way most of this research
outside of behavioral economics that

6082
01:40:09,510 --> 01:40:09,520
outside of behavioral economics that
 

6083
01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:11,590
outside of behavioral economics that
just looked at condom use decisions

6084
01:40:11,590 --> 01:40:11,600
just looked at condom use decisions
 

6085
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:14,310
just looked at condom use decisions
um very little of which has ever

6086
01:40:14,310 --> 01:40:14,320
um very little of which has ever
 

6087
01:40:14,320 --> 01:40:15,830
um very little of which has ever
actually administered the drugs which is

6088
01:40:15,830 --> 01:40:15,840
actually administered the drugs which is
 

6089
01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:17,350
actually administered the drugs which is
another unique aspect

6090
01:40:17,350 --> 01:40:17,360
another unique aspect
 

6091
01:40:17,360 --> 01:40:18,950
another unique aspect
but they usually just look at like

6092
01:40:18,950 --> 01:40:18,960
but they usually just look at like
 

6093
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:20,470
but they usually just look at like
assuming the condom is there

6094
01:40:20,470 --> 01:40:20,480
assuming the condom is there
 

6095
01:40:20,480 --> 01:40:22,470
assuming the condom is there
but this is more using behavioral

6096
01:40:22,470 --> 01:40:22,480
but this is more using behavioral
 

6097
01:40:22,480 --> 01:40:23,990
but this is more using behavioral
economics to delve in and model

6098
01:40:23,990 --> 01:40:24,000
economics to delve in and model
 

6099
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:25,350
economics to delve in and model
something that and i've done survey

6100
01:40:25,350 --> 01:40:25,360
something that and i've done survey
 

6101
01:40:25,360 --> 01:40:26,310
something that and i've done survey
research on this

6102
01:40:26,310 --> 01:40:26,320
research on this
 

6103
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:29,109
research on this
modeling what actually happens like you

6104
01:40:29,109 --> 01:40:29,119
modeling what actually happens like you
 

6105
01:40:29,119 --> 01:40:30,629
modeling what actually happens like you
meet someone at a laundromat

6106
01:40:30,629 --> 01:40:30,639
meet someone at a laundromat
 

6107
01:40:30,639 --> 01:40:32,629
meet someone at a laundromat
like you weren't planning on like you

6108
01:40:32,629 --> 01:40:32,639
like you weren't planning on like you
 

6109
01:40:32,639 --> 01:40:34,790
like you weren't planning on like you
know one thing leads to another they

6110
01:40:34,790 --> 01:40:34,800
know one thing leads to another they
 

6111
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:36,470
know one thing leads to another they
live around the corner yeah

6112
01:40:36,470 --> 01:40:36,480
live around the corner yeah
 

6113
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:39,109
live around the corner yeah
these things you know and like we did

6114
01:40:39,109 --> 01:40:39,119
these things you know and like we did
 

6115
01:40:39,119 --> 01:40:40,470
these things you know and like we did
one um

6116
01:40:40,470 --> 01:40:40,480
one um
 

6117
01:40:40,480 --> 01:40:42,390
one um
survey with with men who have sex with

6118
01:40:42,390 --> 01:40:42,400
survey with with men who have sex with
 

6119
01:40:42,400 --> 01:40:44,950
survey with with men who have sex with
men and found that uh

6120
01:40:44,950 --> 01:40:44,960
men and found that uh
 

6121
01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:48,149
men and found that uh
25 of them 24 about a quarter

6122
01:40:48,149 --> 01:40:48,159
25 of them 24 about a quarter
 

6123
01:40:48,159 --> 01:40:49,990
25 of them 24 about a quarter
reported in the last six months that

6124
01:40:49,990 --> 01:40:50,000
reported in the last six months that
 

6125
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:51,270
reported in the last six months that
they had unprotected

6126
01:40:51,270 --> 01:40:51,280
they had unprotected
 

6127
01:40:51,280 --> 01:40:54,149
they had unprotected
anal intercourse which is the most risky

6128
01:40:54,149 --> 01:40:54,159
anal intercourse which is the most risky
 

6129
01:40:54,159 --> 01:40:54,790
anal intercourse which is the most risky
in terms of

6130
01:40:54,790 --> 01:40:54,800
in terms of
 

6131
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:58,390
in terms of
uh sexually transmitted infection um uh

6132
01:40:58,390 --> 01:40:58,400
uh sexually transmitted infection um uh
 

6133
01:40:58,400 --> 01:41:00,229
uh sexually transmitted infection um uh
in the last six months in a situation

6134
01:41:00,229 --> 01:41:00,239
in the last six months in a situation
 

6135
01:41:00,239 --> 01:41:01,830
in the last six months in a situation
where they would have used a condom but

6136
01:41:01,830 --> 01:41:01,840
where they would have used a condom but
 

6137
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:03,030
where they would have used a condom but
they simply didn't use one just because

6138
01:41:03,030 --> 01:41:03,040
they simply didn't use one just because
 

6139
01:41:03,040 --> 01:41:04,950
they simply didn't use one just because
they didn't have one on them

6140
01:41:04,950 --> 01:41:04,960
they didn't have one on them
 

6141
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:07,990
they didn't have one on them
so this to me it's like if unless we

6142
01:41:07,990 --> 01:41:08,000
so this to me it's like if unless we
 

6143
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:08,870
so this to me it's like if unless we
delve into this

6144
01:41:08,870 --> 01:41:08,880
delve into this
 

6145
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:11,270
delve into this
and understand this these sub-optimal

6146
01:41:11,270 --> 01:41:11,280
and understand this these sub-optimal
 

6147
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:12,310
and understand this these sub-optimal
conditions

6148
01:41:12,310 --> 01:41:12,320
conditions
 

6149
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:13,590
conditions
we're not going to fully address the

6150
01:41:13,590 --> 01:41:13,600
we're not going to fully address the
 

6151
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:15,109
we're not going to fully address the
problem there's plenty of people that

6152
01:41:15,109 --> 01:41:15,119
problem there's plenty of people that
 

6153
01:41:15,119 --> 01:41:16,870
problem there's plenty of people that
say yep condom use is good

6154
01:41:16,870 --> 01:41:16,880
say yep condom use is good

like
where is that failing and it's under

where is that failing and it's under
 

6161
01:41:21,679 --> 01:41:23,109
where is that failing and it's under
these sub-optimal conditions which in

6162
01:41:23,109 --> 01:41:23,119
these sub-optimal conditions which in
 

6163
01:41:23,119 --> 01:41:24,709
these sub-optimal conditions which in
frank if you think about it it's like

6164
01:41:24,709 --> 01:41:24,719
frank if you think about it it's like
 

6165
01:41:24,719 --> 01:41:26,390
frank if you think about it it's like
most of the case

6166

and though there's something to be uh
 

6185
01:41:45,679 --> 01:41:47,510
and though there's something to be uh
studied there on the

that just seems like an unfortunate set
 

6189
01:41:49,280 --> 01:41:50,229
that just seems like an unfortunate set
of circumstances like what's the

of circumstances like what's the
 

6191
01:41:50,239 --> 01:41:51,189
of circumstances like what's the
solution to that

6192

solution to that
 

6193
01:41:51,199 --> 01:41:55,109
solution to that
is uh i mean um

uh
 

6199
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:01,430
uh
like taken apart there because it just

6200
01:42:01,430 --> 01:42:01,440
like taken apart there because it just
 

6201
01:42:01,440 --> 01:42:02,870
like taken apart there because it just
seems like that's the way of life we

6202
01:42:02,870 --> 01:42:02,880
seems like that's the way of life we
 

6203
01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:04,310
seems like that's the way of life we
don't expect the things that

6204
01:42:04,310 --> 01:42:04,320
don't expect the things that
 

6205
01:42:04,320 --> 01:42:05,669
don't expect the things that
right to happen are we supposed to

6206
01:42:05,669 --> 01:42:05,679
right to happen are we supposed to
 

6207
01:42:05,679 --> 01:42:07,510
right to happen are we supposed to
expect them better to

expect them better to
 

6209
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:10,470

be like be self-aware enough about our
 

6211
01:42:10,480 --> 01:42:11,510
be like be self-aware enough about our
calculations

6212
01:42:11,510 --> 01:42:11,520
calculations
 

6213
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:14,550
calculations
or you see the 10-minute detour

6214
01:42:14,550 --> 01:42:14,560
or you see the 10-minute detour
 

6215
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:16,550
or you see the 10-minute detour
to a convenience store as a kind of

6216

thing
 

6219
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:22,310
thing
that uh we need to understand um

6220
01:42:22,310 --> 01:42:22,320
that uh we need to understand um
 

6221
01:42:22,320 --> 01:42:26,390
that uh we need to understand um
how we humans evaluate the cost of that

6222
01:42:26,390 --> 01:42:26,400
how we humans evaluate the cost of that
 

6223
01:42:26,400 --> 01:42:28,870
how we humans evaluate the cost of that
i think in terms of like how we use this

6224
01:42:28,870 --> 01:42:28,880
i think in terms of like how we use this
 

6225
01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:29,669
i think in terms of like how we use this
to help people

6226
01:42:29,669 --> 01:42:29,679
to help people
 

6227
01:42:29,679 --> 01:42:31,990
to help people

yes it's mostly on the environment side
 

6229
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:33,510
yes it's mostly on the environment side
rather on the on the

rather on the on the
individual side yeah although those

6232
01:42:35,189 --> 01:42:35,199
individual side yeah although those
 

6233
01:42:35,199 --> 01:42:36,870
individual side yeah although those
those interact so it's like

6234
01:42:36,870 --> 01:42:36,880
those interact so it's like
 

6235

lot of studies in sexual decision making
 

6525
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:55,030
lot of studies in sexual decision making
with different drugs

6526
01:46:55,030 --> 01:46:55,040
with different drugs
 

6527
01:46:55,040 --> 01:46:57,669
with different drugs
is there some interesting insights or

6528
01:46:57,669 --> 01:46:57,679
is there some interesting insights or
 

6529
01:46:57,679 --> 01:46:59,430
is there some interesting insights or
findings

6530
01:46:59,430 --> 01:46:59,440
findings
 

6531
01:46:59,440 --> 01:47:01,990
findings
on the difference between the different

6532
01:47:01,990 --> 01:47:02,000
on the difference between the different
 

6533
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:02,950
on the difference between the different
drugs

6534
01:47:02,950 --> 01:47:02,960
drugs
 

6535
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:06,470
drugs
so i think you said meth as well

6536
01:47:06,470 --> 01:47:06,480
so i think you said meth as well
 

6537
01:47:06,480 --> 01:47:08,870
so i think you said meth as well
so cocaine is there some interesting

6538
01:47:08,870 --> 01:47:08,880
so cocaine is there some interesting
 

6539
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:10,709
so cocaine is there some interesting
characteristics about decision making

6540
01:47:10,709 --> 01:47:10,719
characteristics about decision making
 

6541
01:47:10,719 --> 01:47:12,550
characteristics about decision making
that these drugs alter versus like

6542
01:47:12,550 --> 01:47:12,560
that these drugs alter versus like
 

6543
01:47:12,560 --> 01:47:14,629
that these drugs alter versus like
alcohol all those kinds of things i

6544
01:47:14,629 --> 01:47:14,639
alcohol all those kinds of things i
 

6545
01:47:14,639 --> 01:47:16,229
alcohol all those kinds of things i
think and there's much more to study

6546
01:47:16,229 --> 01:47:16,239
think and there's much more to study
 

6547
01:47:16,239 --> 01:47:17,990
think and there's much more to study
with this but i think

6548
01:47:17,990 --> 01:47:18,000
with this but i think
 

6549
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,310
with this but i think
the biggie there is that the stimulants

6550
01:47:20,310 --> 01:47:20,320
the biggie there is that the stimulants
 

6551
01:47:20,320 --> 01:47:21,990
the biggie there is that the stimulants
they create risky sex by

6552
01:47:21,990 --> 01:47:22,000
they create risky sex by
 

6553
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:25,430
they create risky sex by
really increasing the rewarding value of

6554
01:47:25,430 --> 01:47:25,440
really increasing the rewarding value of
 

6555
01:47:25,440 --> 01:47:26,070
really increasing the rewarding value of
sex

6556
01:47:26,070 --> 01:47:26,080
sex
 

6557
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:27,510
sex
like if you talk to people that are real

6558
01:47:27,510 --> 01:47:27,520
like if you talk to people that are real
 

6559
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:29,750
like if you talk to people that are real
especially that have are hooked on

6560
01:47:29,750 --> 01:47:29,760
especially that have are hooked on
 

6561
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:32,229
especially that have are hooked on
stimulants one of the biggies is like

6562
01:47:32,229 --> 01:47:32,239
stimulants one of the biggies is like
 

6563
01:47:32,239 --> 01:47:34,709
stimulants one of the biggies is like
sex on coke or meth is like so much

6564
01:47:34,709 --> 01:47:34,719
sex on coke or meth is like so much
 

6565
01:47:34,719 --> 01:47:36,550
sex on coke or meth is like so much
better than sex without and that's a big

6566
01:47:36,550 --> 01:47:36,560
better than sex without and that's a big
 

6567
01:47:36,560 --> 01:47:37,590
better than sex without and that's a big
part of what

6568
01:47:37,590 --> 01:47:37,600
part of what
 

6569
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:38,950
part of what
why they have trouble quitting because

6570
01:47:38,950 --> 01:47:38,960
why they have trouble quitting because
 

6571
01:47:38,960 --> 01:47:41,590
why they have trouble quitting because
it's so tied to their sex life

6572
01:47:41,590 --> 01:47:41,600
it's so tied to their sex life
 

6573
01:47:41,600 --> 01:47:43,669
it's so tied to their sex life
so it's not that your decision making is

6574
01:47:43,669 --> 01:47:43,679
so it's not that your decision making is
 

6575
01:47:43,679 --> 01:47:45,270
so it's not that your decision making is
broken it's just that you

6576
01:47:45,270 --> 01:47:45,280
broken it's just that you
 

6577
01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:47,270
broken it's just that you
well you allocate it's a different

6578
01:47:47,270 --> 01:47:47,280
well you allocate it's a different
 

6579
01:47:47,280 --> 01:47:48,709
well you allocate it's a different
aspect of their decision yeah

6580
01:47:48,709 --> 01:47:48,719
aspect of their decision yeah
 

6581
01:47:48,719 --> 01:47:50,149
aspect of their decision yeah
on the reward side i think on the

6582
01:47:50,149 --> 01:47:50,159
on the reward side i think on the
 

6583
01:47:50,159 --> 01:47:51,510
on the reward side i think on the
alcohol it works more through

6584
01:47:51,510 --> 01:47:51,520
alcohol it works more through
 

6585
01:47:51,520 --> 01:47:53,030
alcohol it works more through
disinhibition it's like

6586
01:47:53,030 --> 01:47:53,040
disinhibition it's like
 

6587
01:47:53,040 --> 01:47:56,149
disinhibition it's like
alcohol is really good at reducing the

6588
01:47:56,149 --> 01:47:56,159
alcohol is really good at reducing the
 

6589
01:47:56,159 --> 01:47:57,910
alcohol is really good at reducing the
ability of a delayed

6590
01:47:57,910 --> 01:47:57,920
ability of a delayed
 

6591
01:47:57,920 --> 01:47:59,830
ability of a delayed
punisher to have an effect on current

6592
01:47:59,830 --> 01:47:59,840
punisher to have an effect on current
 

6593
01:47:59,840 --> 01:48:01,590
punisher to have an effect on current
behavior in other words there's this bad

6594
01:48:01,590 --> 01:48:01,600
behavior in other words there's this bad
 

6595
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:03,189
behavior in other words there's this bad
thing that's going to happen tomorrow or

6596
01:48:03,189 --> 01:48:03,199
thing that's going to happen tomorrow or
 

6597
01:48:03,199 --> 01:48:04,070
thing that's going to happen tomorrow or
a week from now

6598
01:48:04,070 --> 01:48:04,080
a week from now
 

6599
01:48:04,080 --> 01:48:07,430
a week from now
or 20 years from now um

6600
01:48:07,430 --> 01:48:07,440
or 20 years from now um
 

6601
01:48:07,440 --> 01:48:09,189
or 20 years from now um
being drunk is a really good way and you

6602
01:48:09,189 --> 01:48:09,199
being drunk is a really good way and you
 

6603
01:48:09,199 --> 01:48:11,510
being drunk is a really good way and you
see this in like rats making decisions

6604
01:48:11,510 --> 01:48:11,520
see this in like rats making decisions
 

6605
01:48:11,520 --> 01:48:14,229
see this in like rats making decisions
you know a high dose of alcohol makes

6606
01:48:14,229 --> 01:48:14,239
you know a high dose of alcohol makes
 

6607
01:48:14,239 --> 01:48:14,709
you know a high dose of alcohol makes
someone

6608
01:48:14,709 --> 01:48:14,719
someone
 

6609
01:48:14,719 --> 01:48:16,709
someone
less sensitive to those consequences so

6610
01:48:16,709 --> 01:48:16,719
less sensitive to those consequences so
 

6611
01:48:16,719 --> 01:48:18,550
less sensitive to those consequences so
i think that's the lever that's being

6612
01:48:18,550 --> 01:48:18,560
i think that's the lever that's being
 

6613
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:19,990
i think that's the lever that's being
hit with alcohol

6614
01:48:19,990 --> 01:48:20,000
hit with alcohol
 

6615
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:21,510
hit with alcohol
and it's the more the just the

6616
01:48:21,510 --> 01:48:21,520
and it's the more the just the
 

6617
01:48:21,520 --> 01:48:24,470
and it's the more the just the
increasing the rewarding value of sex

6618
01:48:24,470 --> 01:48:24,480
increasing the rewarding value of sex
 

6619
01:48:24,480 --> 01:48:26,790
increasing the rewarding value of sex
um by the psycho stimulants on that side

6620
01:48:26,790 --> 01:48:26,800
um by the psycho stimulants on that side
 

6621
01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:27,990
um by the psycho stimulants on that side
we actually found that it

6622
01:48:27,990 --> 01:48:28,000
we actually found that it
 

6623
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:29,350
we actually found that it
and it was amazing because like hundreds

and hiv like we ran the first study
 

6635
01:48:37,600 --> 01:48:40,149
and hiv like we ran the first study
on my grant that like actually just gave

people cocaine
 

6639
01:48:41,679 --> 01:48:43,430
people cocaine
under double blind conditions and showed

6640
01:48:43,430 --> 01:48:43,440
under double blind conditions and showed
 

6641
01:48:43,440 --> 01:48:46,550
under double blind conditions and showed
that like yeah when people are on coke

these drugs but that's a rigorous study
 

6667
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:07,750
these drugs but that's a rigorous study
that's in the lab just shows

6668
01:49:07,750 --> 01:49:07,760
that's in the lab just shows
 

6669
01:49:07,760 --> 01:49:10,310
that's in the lab just shows
like there's a plot right the dose

6670
01:49:10,310 --> 01:49:10,320
like there's a plot right the dose
 

6671
01:49:10,320 --> 01:49:12,470
like there's a plot right the dose
effects of that the time course of that

6672
01:49:12,470 --> 01:49:12,480
effects of that the time course of that
 

6673
01:49:12,480 --> 01:49:14,229
effects of that the time course of that
yeah it's not just please tell me

6674
01:49:14,229 --> 01:49:14,239
yeah it's not just please tell me
 

6675
01:49:14,239 --> 01:49:15,910
yeah it's not just please tell me
there's a paper with the plot

6676
01:49:15,910 --> 01:49:15,920
there's a paper with the plot
 

6677
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:19,030
there's a paper with the plot
that shows dose versus uh uh

6678
01:49:19,030 --> 01:49:19,040
that shows dose versus uh uh
 

6679
01:49:19,040 --> 01:49:21,350
that shows dose versus uh uh
evaluation of like horniness yeah we

6680
01:49:21,350 --> 01:49:21,360
evaluation of like horniness yeah we
 

6681
01:49:21,360 --> 01:49:23,109
evaluation of like horniness yeah we
didn't say horniness we said sexual

6682
01:49:23,109 --> 01:49:23,119
didn't say horniness we said sexual
 

6683
01:49:23,119 --> 01:49:23,830
didn't say horniness we said sexual
arousal

6684
01:49:23,830 --> 01:49:23,840
arousal
 

6685
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:25,510
arousal
yeah basically yeah there's a plot i'm

6686
01:49:25,510 --> 01:49:25,520
yeah basically yeah there's a plot i'm
 

6687
01:49:25,520 --> 01:49:27,270
yeah basically yeah there's a plot i'm
gonna find this plot right i'll send it

6688
01:49:27,270 --> 01:49:27,280
gonna find this plot right i'll send it
 

6689
01:49:27,280 --> 01:49:27,990
gonna find this plot right i'll send it
to you there was

6690
01:49:27,990 --> 01:49:28,000
to you there was
 

6691
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:31,750
to you there was
one headline from uh some publicity on

one headline from uh some publicity on
the work that said

6694
01:49:33,669 --> 01:49:33,679
the work that said
 

6695
01:49:33,679 --> 01:49:36,390
the work that said
horny cocaine users don't use condoms or

6696
01:49:36,390 --> 01:49:36,400
horny cocaine users don't use condoms or
 

6697
01:49:36,400 --> 01:49:37,430
horny cocaine users don't use condoms or
something like that

6698
01:49:37,430 --> 01:49:37,440
something like that
 

6699
01:49:37,440 --> 01:49:39,350
something like that
like something like journalists i

6700
01:49:39,350 --> 01:49:39,360
like something like journalists i
 

6701
01:49:39,360 --> 01:49:40,709
like something like journalists i
wouldn't have put it that way but like

6702
01:49:40,709 --> 01:49:40,719
wouldn't have put it that way but like
 

6703
01:49:40,719 --> 01:49:41,510
wouldn't have put it that way but like
yeah that's right

6704
01:49:41,510 --> 01:49:41,520
yeah that's right
 

6705
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:44,149
yeah that's right
i guess that's what it finds so you've

6706
01:49:44,149 --> 01:49:44,159
i guess that's what it finds so you've
 

6707
01:49:44,159 --> 01:49:45,830
i guess that's what it finds so you've
published a bunch of studies on

6708
01:49:45,830 --> 01:49:45,840
published a bunch of studies on
 

6709
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:50,149
published a bunch of studies on
uh psychedelics is there

6710
01:49:50,149 --> 01:49:50,159
uh psychedelics is there
 

6711
01:49:50,159 --> 01:49:53,430
uh psychedelics is there
some especially favorite

6712
01:49:53,430 --> 01:49:53,440
some especially favorite
 

6713
01:49:53,440 --> 01:49:55,350
some especially favorite
insightful findings from some of these

6714
01:49:55,350 --> 01:49:55,360
insightful findings from some of these
 

6715
01:49:55,360 --> 01:49:57,270
insightful findings from some of these
they you could talk about

6716
01:49:57,270 --> 01:49:57,280
they you could talk about
 

6717
01:49:57,280 --> 01:50:00,070
they you could talk about
maybe favorite studies or just something

6718
01:50:00,070 --> 01:50:00,080
maybe favorite studies or just something
 

6719
01:50:00,080 --> 01:50:01,510
maybe favorite studies or just something
that pops to mind

6720
01:50:01,510 --> 01:50:01,520
that pops to mind
 

6721
01:50:01,520 --> 01:50:04,470
that pops to mind
in terms of uh both the goals and the

6722
01:50:04,470 --> 01:50:04,480
in terms of uh both the goals and the
 

6723
01:50:04,480 --> 01:50:06,550
in terms of uh both the goals and the
like the major insights gained

6724
01:50:06,550 --> 01:50:06,560
like the major insights gained
 

6725
01:50:06,560 --> 01:50:09,350
like the major insights gained
and maybe the side little curiosities

6726
01:50:09,350 --> 01:50:09,360
and maybe the side little curiosities
 

6727
01:50:09,360 --> 01:50:11,350
and maybe the side little curiosities
that you discovered along the way

6728
01:50:11,350 --> 01:50:11,360
that you discovered along the way
 

6729
01:50:11,360 --> 01:50:14,149
that you discovered along the way
yeah i think of the work with like using

6730
01:50:14,149 --> 01:50:14,159
yeah i think of the work with like using
 

6731
01:50:14,159 --> 01:50:16,149
yeah i think of the work with like using
psilocybin to help people quit smoking

6732
01:50:16,149 --> 01:50:16,159
psilocybin to help people quit smoking
 

6733
01:50:16,159 --> 01:50:18,470
psilocybin to help people quit smoking
and we've talked about smoking being

6734
01:50:18,470 --> 01:50:18,480
and we've talked about smoking being
 

6735
01:50:18,480 --> 01:50:19,589
and we've talked about smoking being
such a

6736
01:50:19,589 --> 01:50:19,599
such a
 

6737
01:50:19,599 --> 01:50:22,629
such a
a serious addiction and so that what

6738
01:50:22,629 --> 01:50:22,639
a serious addiction and so that what
 

6739
01:50:22,639 --> 01:50:23,990
a serious addiction and so that what
inspired me to get into that

6740
01:50:23,990 --> 01:50:24,000
inspired me to get into that
 

6741
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,390
inspired me to get into that
was just kind of having like behavioral

6742
01:50:26,390 --> 01:50:26,400
was just kind of having like behavioral
 

6743
01:50:26,400 --> 01:50:30,229
was just kind of having like behavioral
psychology is my primary lens sort of a

6744
01:50:30,229 --> 01:50:30,239
psychology is my primary lens sort of a
 

6745
01:50:30,239 --> 01:50:33,990
psychology is my primary lens sort of a
a this sort of like being a kind of

6746
01:50:33,990 --> 01:50:34,000
a this sort of like being a kind of
 

6747
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:37,669
a this sort of like being a kind of
radical empirical basis of

6748
01:50:37,669 --> 01:50:37,679
radical empirical basis of
 

6749
01:50:37,679 --> 01:50:40,109
radical empirical basis of
i'm really interested in the mystical

6750
01:50:40,109 --> 01:50:40,119
i'm really interested in the mystical
 

6751
01:50:40,119 --> 01:50:42,229
i'm really interested in the mystical
experience and the

6752
01:50:42,229 --> 01:50:42,239
experience and the
 

6753
01:50:42,239 --> 01:50:46,149
experience and the
all of these reports very interested and

6754
01:50:46,149 --> 01:50:46,159
all of these reports very interested and
 

6755
01:50:46,159 --> 01:50:48,709
all of these reports very interested and
but at the same time i'm like okay let's

6756
01:50:48,709 --> 01:50:48,719
but at the same time i'm like okay let's
 

6757
01:50:48,719 --> 01:50:49,910
but at the same time i'm like okay let's
let's get down to some

6758
01:50:49,910 --> 01:50:49,920
let's get down to some
 

6759
01:50:49,920 --> 01:50:52,149
let's get down to some
behavior change and something that we

6760
01:50:52,149 --> 01:50:52,159
behavior change and something that we
 

6761
01:50:52,159 --> 01:50:52,950
behavior change and something that we
can record

6762
01:50:52,950 --> 01:50:52,960
can record
 

6763
01:50:52,960 --> 01:50:55,510
can record
like quantitatively verify um

6764
01:50:55,510 --> 01:50:55,520
like quantitatively verify um
 

6765
01:50:55,520 --> 01:50:56,790
like quantitatively verify um
biologically so

6766
01:50:56,790 --> 01:50:56,800
biologically so
 

6767
01:50:56,800 --> 01:50:59,030
biologically so
to find all kinds of negative behaviors

6768
01:50:59,030 --> 01:50:59,040
to find all kinds of negative behaviors
 

6769
01:50:59,040 --> 01:51:01,830
to find all kinds of negative behaviors
that people practice and see if we can

6770
01:51:01,830 --> 01:51:01,840
that people practice and see if we can
 

6771
01:51:01,840 --> 01:51:04,070
that people practice and see if we can
turn those into positive right like

6772
01:51:04,070 --> 01:51:04,080
turn those into positive right like
 

6773
01:51:04,080 --> 01:51:05,589
turn those into positive right like
really change it not just

6774
01:51:05,589 --> 01:51:05,599
really change it not just
 

6775
01:51:05,599 --> 01:51:07,189
really change it not just
people saying which again is interesting

6776
01:51:07,189 --> 01:51:07,199
people saying which again is interesting
 

6777
01:51:07,199 --> 01:51:08,709
people saying which again is interesting
i'm not dismissing it but folks say that

6778
01:51:08,709 --> 01:51:08,719
i'm not dismissing it but folks say that

it's like yep
 

6785
01:51:13,520 --> 01:51:15,430
it's like yep
that's good all right let's see if we

6786
01:51:15,430 --> 01:51:15,440
that's good all right let's see if we
 

6787
01:51:15,440 --> 01:51:17,510
that's good all right let's see if we
can harness that and test that

6788
01:51:17,510 --> 01:51:17,520
can harness that and test that
 

6789
01:51:17,520 --> 01:51:20,310
can harness that and test that
into something that it's that's real

6790
01:51:20,310 --> 01:51:20,320
into something that it's that's real
 

6791
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:21,510
into something that it's that's real
behavior change

6792
01:51:21,510 --> 01:51:21,520
behavior change
 

6793
01:51:21,520 --> 01:51:23,030
behavior change
you know what i mean it's quantifiable

6794
01:51:23,030 --> 01:51:23,040
you know what i mean it's quantifiable
 

6795
01:51:23,040 --> 01:51:24,629
you know what i mean it's quantifiable
it's like okay you've been smoking for

6796
01:51:24,629 --> 01:51:24,639
it's like okay you've been smoking for
 

6797
01:51:24,639 --> 01:51:25,830
it's like okay you've been smoking for
30 years

6798
01:51:25,830 --> 01:51:25,840
30 years
 

6799
01:51:25,840 --> 01:51:27,589
30 years
you know like that's a real thing and

6800
01:51:27,589 --> 01:51:27,599
you know like that's a real thing and
 

6801
01:51:27,599 --> 01:51:29,270
you know like that's a real thing and
you've tried a dozen times like

6802
01:51:29,270 --> 01:51:29,280
you've tried a dozen times like
 

6803
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:30,950
you've tried a dozen times like
seriously to quit and you haven't been

6804
01:51:30,950 --> 01:51:30,960
seriously to quit and you haven't been
 

6805
01:51:30,960 --> 01:51:32,310
seriously to quit and you haven't been
able to long term

6806
01:51:32,310 --> 01:51:32,320
able to long term
 

6807
01:51:32,320 --> 01:51:35,270
able to long term
like okay and if you quit like we'll ask

6808
01:51:35,270 --> 01:51:35,280
like okay and if you quit like we'll ask
 

6809
01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:37,030
like okay and if you quit like we'll ask
you and i'll believe you but i don't

6810
01:51:37,030 --> 01:51:37,040
you and i'll believe you but i don't
 

6811
01:51:37,040 --> 01:51:37,589

6813
01:51:37,599 --> 01:51:38,790
trust
everyone reading the paper to believe

6814
01:51:38,790 --> 01:51:38,800
everyone reading the paper to believe
 

6815
01:51:38,800 --> 01:51:40,310
everyone reading the paper to believe
you so we're going to have you you pee

6816
01:51:40,310 --> 01:51:40,320
you so we're going to have you you pee
 

6817
01:51:40,320 --> 01:51:41,589
you so we're going to have you you pee
in a cup and we'll test that and we'll

6818
01:51:41,589 --> 01:51:41,599
in a cup and we'll test that and we'll
 

6819
01:51:41,599 --> 01:51:42,870
in a cup and we'll test that and we'll
have you blow into this little machine

6820
01:51:42,870 --> 01:51:42,880
have you blow into this little machine
 

6821
01:51:42,880 --> 01:51:44,470
have you blow into this little machine
that measures carbon monoxide and we'll

6822
01:51:44,470 --> 01:51:44,480
that measures carbon monoxide and we'll
 

6823
01:51:44,480 --> 01:51:45,430
that measures carbon monoxide and we'll
test that

6824
01:51:45,430 --> 01:51:45,440
test that
 

6825
01:51:45,440 --> 01:51:47,350
test that
so multiple levels of biological

6826
01:51:47,350 --> 01:51:47,360
so multiple levels of biological
 

6827
01:51:47,360 --> 01:51:48,870
so multiple levels of biological
verification

6828
01:51:48,870 --> 01:51:48,880
verification
 

6829
01:51:48,880 --> 01:51:50,629
verification
like now we're getting like to me that's

6830
01:51:50,629 --> 01:51:50,639
like now we're getting like to me that's
 

6831
01:51:50,639 --> 01:51:52,149
like now we're getting like to me that's
where the rubber meets the road in terms

6832
01:51:52,149 --> 01:51:52,159
where the rubber meets the road in terms
 

6833
01:51:52,159 --> 01:51:52,550
where the rubber meets the road in terms
of like

6834
01:51:52,550 --> 01:51:52,560
of like
 

6835
01:51:52,560 --> 01:51:54,470
of like
therapeutics it's like can we really

6836
01:51:54,470 --> 01:51:54,480
therapeutics it's like can we really
 

6837
01:51:54,480 --> 01:51:57,109
therapeutics it's like can we really
shift behavior and since

6838
01:51:57,109 --> 01:51:57,119
shift behavior and since
 

6839
01:51:57,119 --> 01:51:58,790
shift behavior and since
and so much as we talked about my other

6840
01:51:58,790 --> 01:51:58,800
and so much as we talked about my other
 

6841
01:51:58,800 --> 01:52:00,390
and so much as we talked about my other
scientific work outside psychedelics is

6842
01:52:00,390 --> 01:52:00,400
scientific work outside psychedelics is
 

6843
01:52:00,400 --> 01:52:02,149
scientific work outside psychedelics is
about understanding addiction

6844
01:52:02,149 --> 01:52:02,159
about understanding addiction
 

6845
01:52:02,159 --> 01:52:03,589
about understanding addiction
and drug use so it's like you know

6846
01:52:03,589 --> 01:52:03,599
and drug use so it's like you know
 

6847
01:52:03,599 --> 01:52:05,350
and drug use so it's like you know
looking at addiction it's a no-brainer

6848
01:52:05,350 --> 01:52:05,360
looking at addiction it's a no-brainer
 

6849
01:52:05,360 --> 01:52:07,270
looking at addiction it's a no-brainer
and smoking is just a great example and

6850
01:52:07,270 --> 01:52:07,280
and smoking is just a great example and
 

6851
01:52:07,280 --> 01:52:09,430
and smoking is just a great example and
so back to your question like we've had

6852
01:52:09,430 --> 01:52:09,440
so back to your question like we've had
 

6853
01:52:09,440 --> 01:52:11,270
so back to your question like we've had
really high success rates i mean it

6854
01:52:11,270 --> 01:52:11,280
really high success rates i mean it
 

6855
01:52:11,280 --> 01:52:12,149
really high success rates i mean it
really

6856
01:52:12,149 --> 01:52:12,159
really
 

6857
01:52:12,159 --> 01:52:14,070
really
it rivals anything that's been published

6858
01:52:14,070 --> 01:52:14,080
it rivals anything that's been published
 

6859
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:16,790
it rivals anything that's been published
in the scientific literature um

6860
01:52:16,790 --> 01:52:16,800
in the scientific literature um
 

6861
01:52:16,800 --> 01:52:18,709
in the scientific literature um
the caveat is that you know that's based

6862
01:52:18,709 --> 01:52:18,719
the caveat is that you know that's based
 

6863
01:52:18,719 --> 01:52:20,790
the caveat is that you know that's based
on our initial trial of only 15 people

6864
01:52:20,790 --> 01:52:20,800
on our initial trial of only 15 people
 

6865
01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:22,790
on our initial trial of only 15 people
but extremely high long-term success

6866
01:52:22,790 --> 01:52:22,800
but extremely high long-term success
 

6867
01:52:22,800 --> 01:52:23,669
but extremely high long-term success
rates

6868
01:52:23,669 --> 01:52:23,679
rates
 

6869
01:52:23,679 --> 01:52:27,270
rates
um 80 at six months per smoke free

6870
01:52:27,270 --> 01:52:27,280
um 80 at six months per smoke free
 

6871
01:52:27,280 --> 01:52:29,270
um 80 at six months per smoke free
so can we uh discuss the details so

6872
01:52:29,270 --> 01:52:29,280
so can we uh discuss the details so
 

6873
01:52:29,280 --> 01:52:30,709
so can we uh discuss the details so
first of all which psychedelic are we

6874
01:52:30,709 --> 01:52:30,719
first of all which psychedelic are we
 

6875
01:52:30,719 --> 01:52:31,589
first of all which psychedelic are we
talking about

6876
01:52:31,589 --> 01:52:31,599
talking about
 

6877
01:52:31,599 --> 01:52:33,830
talking about
and maybe can you talk about the 15

6878
01:52:33,830 --> 01:52:33,840
and maybe can you talk about the 15
 

6879
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:35,669
and maybe can you talk about the 15
people and how the study

6880
01:52:35,669 --> 01:52:35,679
people and how the study
 

6881
01:52:35,679 --> 01:52:38,709
people and how the study
ran and what you found yeah yeah so

6882
01:52:38,709 --> 01:52:38,719
ran and what you found yeah yeah so
 

6883
01:52:38,719 --> 01:52:40,709
ran and what you found yeah yeah so
the the drug we're using is psilocybin

6884
01:52:40,709 --> 01:52:40,719
the the drug we're using is psilocybin
 

6885
01:52:40,719 --> 01:52:42,070
the the drug we're using is psilocybin
and we're using um

6886
01:52:42,070 --> 01:52:42,080
and we're using um
 

6887
01:52:42,080 --> 01:52:44,550
and we're using um
a moderately high and high doses of

6888
01:52:44,550 --> 01:52:44,560
a moderately high and high doses of
 

6889
01:52:44,560 --> 01:52:45,750
a moderately high and high doses of
psilocybin

6890
01:52:45,750 --> 01:52:45,760
psilocybin
 

6891
01:52:45,760 --> 01:52:47,430
psilocybin
and i should say this about most of our

6892
01:52:47,430 --> 01:52:47,440
and i should say this about most of our
 

6893
01:52:47,440 --> 01:52:49,910
and i should say this about most of our
work these are not kind of museum level

6894
01:52:49,910 --> 01:52:49,920
work these are not kind of museum level
 

6895
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:51,830
work these are not kind of museum level
doses in other words nothing

6896
01:52:51,830 --> 01:52:51,840
doses in other words nothing
 

6897
01:52:51,840 --> 01:52:53,350
doses in other words nothing
even big fans of psychedelics want to

6898
01:52:53,350 --> 01:52:53,360
even big fans of psychedelics want to
 

6899
01:52:53,360 --> 01:52:55,830
even big fans of psychedelics want to
take and go to a go to a concert or go

6900
01:52:55,830 --> 01:52:55,840
take and go to a go to a concert or go
 

6901
01:52:55,840 --> 01:52:57,109
take and go to a go to a concert or go
to the museum

6902
01:52:57,109 --> 01:52:57,119
to the museum
 

6903
01:52:57,119 --> 01:52:58,709
to the museum
if someone's at burning man on this type

6904
01:52:58,709 --> 01:52:58,719
if someone's at burning man on this type
 

6905
01:52:58,719 --> 01:53:00,629
if someone's at burning man on this type
of dose like

6906
01:53:00,629 --> 01:53:00,639
of dose like
 

6907
01:53:00,639 --> 01:53:01,750
of dose like
they're probably going to want to find

6908
01:53:01,750 --> 01:53:01,760
they're probably going to want to find
 

6909
01:53:01,760 --> 01:53:03,350
they're probably going to want to find
their way back to their tent and zip up

6910
01:53:03,350 --> 01:53:03,360
their way back to their tent and zip up
 

6911
01:53:03,360 --> 01:53:05,030
their way back to their tent and zip up
and hunker down for

6912
01:53:05,030 --> 01:53:05,040
and hunker down for
 

6913
01:53:05,040 --> 01:53:07,669
and hunker down for
you know not be around strangers yeah

6914
01:53:07,669 --> 01:53:07,679
you know not be around strangers yeah
 

6915
01:53:07,679 --> 01:53:08,390
you know not be around strangers yeah
and by the way

6916
01:53:08,390 --> 01:53:08,400
and by the way
 

6917
01:53:08,400 --> 01:53:11,990
and by the way
uh the the delivery method so psilocybin

6918
01:53:11,990 --> 01:53:12,000
uh the the delivery method so psilocybin
 

6919
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:12,629
uh the the delivery method so psilocybin
is

6920
01:53:12,629 --> 01:53:12,639
is
 

6921
01:53:12,639 --> 01:53:15,990
is
mushrooms i guess uh

6922
01:53:15,990 --> 01:53:16,000
mushrooms i guess uh
 

6923
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:19,350
mushrooms i guess uh
what's the usual is it edible is there

6924
01:53:19,350 --> 01:53:19,360
what's the usual is it edible is there
 

6925
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:19,750
what's the usual is it edible is there
some

6926
01:53:19,750 --> 01:53:19,760
some
 

6927
01:53:19,760 --> 01:53:21,350
some
other way like how people are supposed

6928
01:53:21,350 --> 01:53:21,360
other way like how people are supposed
 

6929
01:53:21,360 --> 01:53:23,270
other way like how people are supposed
to think about uh

6930
01:53:23,270 --> 01:53:23,280
to think about uh
 

6931
01:53:23,280 --> 01:53:24,950
to think about uh
the the correct dosing of these things

6932
01:53:24,950 --> 01:53:24,960
the the correct dosing of these things
 

6933
01:53:24,960 --> 01:53:26,950
the the correct dosing of these things
because i've heard that it's hard to

6934
01:53:26,950 --> 01:53:26,960
because i've heard that it's hard to
 

6935
01:53:26,960 --> 01:53:28,790
because i've heard that it's hard to
dose correctly

6936
01:53:28,790 --> 01:53:28,800
dose correctly
 

6937
01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:30,709
dose correctly
uh that's right that's right so in our

6938
01:53:30,709 --> 01:53:30,719
uh that's right that's right so in our
 

6939
01:53:30,719 --> 01:53:32,790
uh that's right that's right so in our
studies we use the the pure compound

6940
01:53:32,790 --> 01:53:32,800
studies we use the the pure compound
 

6941
01:53:32,800 --> 01:53:35,030
studies we use the the pure compound
psilocybin so it's a single molecule

6942
01:53:35,030 --> 01:53:35,040
psilocybin so it's a single molecule
 

6943
01:53:35,040 --> 01:53:37,189
psilocybin so it's a single molecule
you know a bunch of molecules and we and

6944
01:53:37,189 --> 01:53:37,199
you know a bunch of molecules and we and
 

6945
01:53:37,199 --> 01:53:38,229
you know a bunch of molecules and we and
we

6946
01:53:38,229 --> 01:53:38,239
we
 

6947
01:53:38,239 --> 01:53:41,109
we
give them a capsule with that in it um

6948
01:53:41,109 --> 01:53:41,119
give them a capsule with that in it um
 

6949
01:53:41,119 --> 01:53:41,910
give them a capsule with that in it um
uh

6950
01:53:41,910 --> 01:53:41,920
uh
 

6951
01:53:41,920 --> 01:53:43,510
uh
and so it's just you know a little

6952
01:53:43,510 --> 01:53:43,520
and so it's just you know a little
 

6953
01:53:43,520 --> 01:53:46,870
and so it's just you know a little
capsule they swallow what

6954
01:53:46,870 --> 01:53:46,880
capsule they swallow what
 

6955
01:53:46,880 --> 01:53:49,270
capsule they swallow what

of mushrooms
 

6961
01:53:52,239 --> 01:53:53,990

um because they're so easy to grow
 

6963

rogan
i think that jamie his producer is uh

7098
01:56:06,149 --> 01:56:06,159
i think that jamie his producer is uh
 

7099
01:56:06,159 --> 01:56:09,430
i think that jamie his producer is uh
immune to uh uh psyched

7100
01:56:09,430 --> 01:56:09,440
immune to uh uh psyched
 

7101
01:56:09,440 --> 01:56:11,350
immune to uh uh psyched
so maybe he's he's a good recruit for

the study to test
so that's interesting now i'm not the

there
uh rules on uh dosage for

like what places where it's this is this
 

7143
01:56:49,760 --> 01:56:51,669
like what places where it's this is this
all goes it probably is state by state

7144
01:56:51,669 --> 01:56:51,679
all goes it probably is state by state
 

7145
01:56:51,679 --> 01:56:53,030
all goes it probably is state by state
right it is but most

7146

right it is but most
 

7147
01:56:53,040 --> 01:56:54,870
right it is but most
they've gone that direction and states

7148
01:56:54,870 --> 01:56:54,880
they've gone that direction and states
 

7149
01:56:54,880 --> 01:56:56,229
they've gone that direction and states
that didn't initially have these

7150
01:56:56,229 --> 01:56:56,239
that didn't initially have these
 

7151
01:56:56,239 --> 01:56:57,990
that didn't initially have these
rules have not now have them so it's

7152
01:56:57,990 --> 01:56:58,000
rules have not now have them so it's
 

7153

counter bar being 10
 

7173
01:57:15,440 --> 01:57:17,109
counter bar being 10
milligrams but it's like no the whole

edible consume this massive
 

7213
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:48,790
edible consume this massive
you know but there's huge tolerance so a

7214
01:57:48,790 --> 01:57:48,800
you know but there's huge tolerance so a
 

7215
01:57:48,800 --> 01:57:50,470
you know but there's huge tolerance so a
regular like for

7216
01:57:50,470 --> 01:57:50,480
regular like for
 

7217
01:57:50,480 --> 01:57:52,070
regular like for
someone who's smoking weed every day

7218

someone who's smoking weed every day
 

7219
01:57:52,080 --> 01:57:53,910
someone who's smoking weed every day
they might take five milligrams and

7220
01:57:53,910 --> 01:57:53,920
they might take five milligrams and
 

7221
01:57:53,920 --> 01:57:55,669
they might take five milligrams and
kind of hardly feel anything and they

7222
01:57:55,669 --> 01:57:55,679
kind of hardly feel anything and they
 

7223
01:57:55,679 --> 01:57:57,589
kind of hardly feel anything and they
might not make it they may really need

7224
01:57:57,589 --> 01:57:57,599
might not make it they may really need
 

7225
01:57:57,599 --> 01:58:00,790
might not make it they may really need
something like 30 40 50 milligrams to

7226
01:58:00,790 --> 01:58:00,800
something like 30 40 50 milligrams to
 

7227
01:58:00,800 --> 01:58:02,149
something like 30 40 50 milligrams to
have a strong effect

7228
01:58:02,149 --> 01:58:02,159
have a strong effect
 

7229
01:58:02,159 --> 01:58:05,189
have a strong effect
but yeah so that's they've evolved in

7230
01:58:05,189 --> 01:58:05,199
but yeah so that's they've evolved in
 

7231
01:58:05,199 --> 01:58:07,510
but yeah so that's they've evolved in
terms of the rules about like okay

7232
01:58:07,510 --> 01:58:07,520
terms of the rules about like okay
 

7233
01:58:07,520 --> 01:58:10,870
terms of the rules about like okay
what constitutes a dose you know

7234
01:58:10,870 --> 01:58:10,880
what constitutes a dose you know
 

7235
01:58:10,880 --> 01:58:12,790
what constitutes a dose you know
which is why you see less big candy bars

7236
01:58:12,790 --> 01:58:12,800
which is why you see less big candy bars
 

7237
01:58:12,800 --> 01:58:14,229
which is why you see less big candy bars
and more or if there is you're

7238
01:58:14,229 --> 01:58:14,239
and more or if there is you're
 

7239
01:58:14,239 --> 01:58:15,510
and more or if there is you're
if it is a whole candy bar you're only

7240
01:58:15,510 --> 01:58:15,520
if it is a whole candy bar you're only
 

7241
01:58:15,520 --> 01:58:16,550
if it is a whole candy bar you're only
getting a smaller dose like 10

7242
01:58:16,550 --> 01:58:16,560
getting a smaller dose like 10
 

7243
01:58:16,560 --> 01:58:17,830
getting a smaller dose like 10
milligrams or

7244
01:58:17,830 --> 01:58:17,840
milligrams or
 

7245
01:58:17,840 --> 01:58:19,589
milligrams or
yeah because that's is where people get

7246
01:58:19,589 --> 01:58:19,599
yeah because that's is where people get
 

7247
01:58:19,599 --> 01:58:22,229
yeah because that's is where people get
in trouble more often with edibles

7248
01:58:22,229 --> 01:58:22,239
in trouble more often with edibles
 

7249

you've also added this to the science

7490
02:02:04,149 --> 02:02:04,159
you've also added this to the science
 

7491
02:02:04,159 --> 02:02:05,830
you've also added this to the science
and have a paper on

psychedelic experiences
 

7497
02:02:09,119 --> 02:02:11,109
psychedelic experiences
right and we found basically that the

02:02:11,109 --> 02:02:11,119
right and we found basically that the
 

7499
02:02:11,119 --> 02:02:12,470
right and we found basically that the
about the same effect even

about the same effect even
 

7501
02:02:12,480 --> 02:02:14,149
about the same effect even
by a trend not significant but a little

7502
02:02:14,149 --> 02:02:14,159
by a trend not significant but a little
 

7503
02:02:14,159 --> 02:02:16,470
by a trend not significant but a little
bit better of an effect both in terms of

7504
02:02:16,470 --> 02:02:16,480
bit better of an effect both in terms of
 

7505
02:02:16,480 --> 02:02:18,870
bit better of an effect both in terms of
um subjective experience and long term

on in your mind and even the cops at
 

7827
02:07:17,440 --> 02:07:19,350
on in your mind and even the cops at
that layer even though it's extremely

7828
02:07:19,350 --> 02:07:19,360
that layer even though it's extremely
 

7829
02:07:19,360 --> 02:07:20,069
that layer even though it's extremely
unlikely

7830
02:07:20,069 --> 02:07:20,079
unlikely
 

7831
02:07:20,079 --> 02:07:22,229
unlikely
yeah for most people that cops would

7832
02:07:22,229 --> 02:07:22,239
yeah for most people that cops would
 

7833
02:07:22,239 --> 02:07:23,669
yeah for most people that cops would
come in and bust them right when

7834
02:07:23,669 --> 02:07:23,679
come in and bust them right when
 

7835
02:07:23,679 --> 02:07:25,430
come in and bust them right when
like even at that theoretical like that

7836
02:07:25,430 --> 02:07:25,440
like even at that theoretical like that
 

7837
02:07:25,440 --> 02:07:27,189
like even at that theoretical like that
one in a billion chance like that might

7838
02:07:27,189 --> 02:07:27,199
one in a billion chance like that might
 

7839
02:07:27,199 --> 02:07:29,270
one in a billion chance like that might
be a real thing psychologically

7840
02:07:29,270 --> 02:07:29,280
be a real thing psychologically
 

7841
02:07:29,280 --> 02:07:31,270
be a real thing psychologically
in this context we even got that covered

7842
02:07:31,270 --> 02:07:31,280
in this context we even got that covered
 

7843
02:07:31,280 --> 02:07:33,030
in this context we even got that covered
this is we've got dea approval

7844
02:07:33,030 --> 02:07:33,040
this is we've got dea approval
 

7845
02:07:33,040 --> 02:07:35,510
this is we've got dea approval
yeah like you are this is okay by every

yeah like you are this is okay by every
level of society

7848
02:07:36,629 --> 02:07:36,639
level of society
 

7849
02:07:36,639 --> 02:07:38,950
level of society
yeah that counts you know that has the

7850
02:07:38,950 --> 02:07:38,960
yeah that counts you know that has the
 

7851
02:07:38,960 --> 02:07:40,790
yeah that counts you know that has the
authority so it's

7852

02:07:40,800 --> 02:07:43,189
authority so it's
so go deep trust the you know trust the

7854
02:07:43,189 --> 02:07:43,199
so go deep trust the you know trust the
 

7855
02:07:43,199 --> 02:07:44,870
so go deep trust the you know trust the
setting trust yourself

7856

so in the experience and this is all
 

7861
02:07:49,679 --> 02:07:52,149
so in the experience and this is all
subjective and by analogy but like

7862
02:07:52,149 --> 02:07:52,159
subjective and by analogy but like
 

7863
02:07:52,159 --> 02:07:55,030
subjective and by analogy but like
if there's a door open it go into it if

and and both of those like those could

8008
02:10:18,149 --> 02:10:18,159
and and both of those like those could
 

8009
02:10:18,159 --> 02:10:19,910
and and both of those like those could
be two minutes apart from each other

8010

02:11:08,239 --> 02:11:10,149
psychodynamic level and i think you
could think about it more broadly than

8060
02:11:10,149 --> 02:11:10,159
could think about it more broadly than
 

8061
02:11:10,159 --> 02:11:12,390
could think about it more broadly than
you know that's kind of jungian but um

8062
02:11:12,390 --> 02:11:12,400
you know that's kind of jungian but um
 

8063
02:11:12,400 --> 02:11:14,390
you know that's kind of jungian but um
just the personal psychological levels

8064
02:11:14,390 --> 02:11:14,400
just the personal psychological levels
 

8065
02:11:14,400 --> 02:11:15,750
just the personal psychological levels
how i think of it like

8066
02:11:15,750 --> 02:11:15,760
how i think of it like
 

8067
02:11:15,760 --> 02:11:17,270
how i think of it like

life review oftentimes people have
 

8071
02:11:18,719 --> 02:11:20,149
life review oftentimes people have

pouring with tears about like
 

8091
02:11:37,199 --> 02:11:39,669
pouring with tears about like
like how much like it hits them so hard

8092
02:11:39,669 --> 02:11:39,679
like how much like it hits them so hard

how important this is yeah and like the

8104
02:11:51,030 --> 02:11:51,040
how important this is yeah and like the
 

8105

what that means in their life so that's
 

8109
02:11:55,040 --> 02:11:56,310
what that means in their life so that's
those are some of the most moving

8110
02:11:56,310 --> 02:11:56,320
those are some of the most moving
 

8111
02:11:56,320 --> 02:11:57,910
those are some of the most moving
experiences to

8112
02:11:57,910 --> 02:11:57,920
experiences to
 

8113
02:11:57,920 --> 02:11:59,589
experiences to
be present for is where people like it

8114
02:11:59,589 --> 02:11:59,599
be present for is where people like it
 

8115
02:11:59,599 --> 02:12:01,430
be present for is where people like it
hits home like what really matters in

8116
02:12:01,430 --> 02:12:01,440
hits home like what really matters in
 

8117
02:12:01,440 --> 02:12:02,709
hits home like what really matters in
their life

8118
02:12:02,709 --> 02:12:02,719
their life
 

8119
02:12:02,719 --> 02:12:05,750
their life
and and then you have this sort of what

8120
02:12:05,750 --> 02:12:05,760
and and then you have this sort of what
 

8121
02:12:05,760 --> 02:12:07,589
and and then you have this sort of what
masters in houston called the archetypal

8122
02:12:07,589 --> 02:12:07,599
masters in houston called the archetypal
 

8123
02:12:07,599 --> 02:12:08,870
masters in houston called the archetypal
realm which

8124
02:12:08,870 --> 02:12:08,880
realm which
 

8125
02:12:08,880 --> 02:12:10,229
realm which
again is sort of viewing him with the

8126
02:12:10,229 --> 02:12:10,239
again is sort of viewing him with the
 

8127
02:12:10,239 --> 02:12:12,310
again is sort of viewing him with the
focus on archetypes

8128
02:12:12,310 --> 02:12:12,320
focus on archetypes
 

8129
02:12:12,320 --> 02:12:13,430
focus on archetypes
which is interesting but i think of that

8130
02:12:13,430 --> 02:12:13,440
which is interesting but i think of that
 

8131
02:12:13,440 --> 02:12:15,830
which is interesting but i think of that
more generally is like symbolic level

8132
02:12:15,830 --> 02:12:15,840
more generally is like symbolic level
 

8133
02:12:15,840 --> 02:12:18,229
more generally is like symbolic level
so just really deep experiences where

8134
02:12:18,229 --> 02:12:18,239
so just really deep experiences where
 

8135
02:12:18,239 --> 02:12:19,510
so just really deep experiences where
you have

8136
02:12:19,510 --> 02:12:19,520
you have
 

8137
02:12:19,520 --> 02:12:21,510
you have
you do have experiences that seem

8138
02:12:21,510 --> 02:12:21,520
you do have experiences that seem
 

8139
02:12:21,520 --> 02:12:22,870
you do have experiences that seem
symbolic of you know

8140
02:12:22,870 --> 02:12:22,880
symbolic of you know
 

8141
02:12:22,880 --> 02:12:24,790
symbolic of you know
very much in like you know what we know

8142
02:12:24,790 --> 02:12:24,800
very much in like you know what we know
 

8143
02:12:24,800 --> 02:12:26,149
very much in like you know what we know
about dreaming and what

8144
02:12:26,149 --> 02:12:26,159
about dreaming and what
 

8145
02:12:26,159 --> 02:12:27,910
about dreaming and what
most people think about dreaming like

8146
02:12:27,910 --> 02:12:27,920
most people think about dreaming like
 

8147
02:12:27,920 --> 02:12:29,589
most people think about dreaming like
there's this randomness of things but

8148
02:12:29,589 --> 02:12:29,599
there's this randomness of things but
 

8149
02:12:29,599 --> 02:12:30,950
there's this randomness of things but
sometimes it's pretty clear in

8150
02:12:30,950 --> 02:12:30,960
sometimes it's pretty clear in
 

8151
02:12:30,960 --> 02:12:32,069
sometimes it's pretty clear in
retrospect oh

8152
02:12:32,069 --> 02:12:32,079
retrospect oh
 

8153
02:12:32,079 --> 02:12:34,229
retrospect oh
like this came up because this thing has

8154
02:12:34,229 --> 02:12:34,239
like this came up because this thing has
 

8155
02:12:34,239 --> 02:12:35,990
like this came up because this thing has
been on my mind

8156
02:12:35,990 --> 02:12:36,000
been on my mind
 

8157
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:37,589
been on my mind
you know recently so it seems to be

8158
02:12:37,589 --> 02:12:37,599
you know recently so it seems to be
 

8159
02:12:37,599 --> 02:12:39,750
you know recently so it seems to be
there there seems to be this symbolic

8160
02:12:39,750 --> 02:12:39,760
there there seems to be this symbolic
 

8161
02:12:39,760 --> 02:12:41,750
there there seems to be this symbolic
level and then they have this the last

8162
02:12:41,750 --> 02:12:41,760
level and then they have this the last
 

8163
02:12:41,760 --> 02:12:43,669
level and then they have this the last
level that they describe as the

8164
02:12:43,669 --> 02:12:43,679
level that they describe as the
 

8165
02:12:43,679 --> 02:12:46,629
level that they describe as the
mystical integral level which and this

8166
02:12:46,629 --> 02:12:46,639
mystical integral level which and this
 

8167
02:12:46,639 --> 02:12:48,229
mystical integral level which and this
is where there's lots of terms for it

8168
02:12:48,229 --> 02:12:48,239
is where there's lots of terms for it
 

8169
02:12:48,239 --> 02:12:49,109
is where there's lots of terms for it
but

8170
02:12:49,109 --> 02:12:49,119
but
 

8171
02:12:49,119 --> 02:12:51,430
but
transcendental experiences experiences

8172
02:12:51,430 --> 02:12:51,440
transcendental experiences experiences
 

8173
02:12:51,440 --> 02:12:52,149
transcendental experiences experiences

mystical type effects we often

8176
02:12:55,270 --> 02:12:55,280
mystical type effects we often

02:12:55,280 --> 02:12:57,830
mystical type effects we often
measure um europeans use a scale that

8178
02:12:57,830 --> 02:12:57,840
measure um europeans use a scale that
 

8179
02:12:57,840 --> 02:13:00,149
measure um europeans use a scale that
will refer to oceanic boundlessness

8180
02:13:00,149 --> 02:13:00,159
will refer to oceanic boundlessness
 

8181
02:13:00,159 --> 02:13:01,990
will refer to oceanic boundlessness
this is all pretty much the same thing

8182
02:13:01,990 --> 02:13:02,000
this is all pretty much the same thing
 

8183
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:03,990
this is all pretty much the same thing
yeah this is like

8184
02:13:03,990 --> 02:13:04,000
yeah this is like
 

8185
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,709
yeah this is like
at some sense the deepest level of the

8186
02:13:06,709 --> 02:13:06,719
at some sense the deepest level of the
 

8187
02:13:06,719 --> 02:13:08,149
at some sense the deepest level of the
very sense of self

8188
02:13:08,149 --> 02:13:08,159
very sense of self
 

8189
02:13:08,159 --> 02:13:11,910
very sense of self
seems to be dissolved

8190
02:13:11,910 --> 02:13:11,920
seems to be dissolved
 

8191
02:13:11,920 --> 02:13:14,069

minimize or expand it such that the

02:13:14,079 --> 02:13:15,189

boundaries of the self
 

8195
02:13:15,199 --> 02:13:16,709
boundaries of the self
go into and here i think some of this is

8196
02:13:16,709 --> 02:13:16,719
go into and here i think some of this is
 

8197
02:13:16,719 --> 02:13:19,109
go into and here i think some of this is
just semantics but whether the self is

02:13:19,109 --> 02:13:19,119
just semantics but whether the self is
 

8199
02:13:19,119 --> 02:13:20,790
just semantics but whether the self is
expanding such that there's no boundary

02:13:20,790 --> 02:13:20,800
expanding such that there's no boundary
 

8201
02:13:20,800 --> 02:13:23,270
expanding such that there's no boundary
between the self and the rest of the

between the self and the rest of the

8205
02:13:25,520 --> 02:13:27,189
universe or whether there's no sense of
self again might be just semantics but

8206
02:13:27,189 --> 02:13:27,199
self again might be just semantics but
 

8207
02:13:27,199 --> 02:13:28,870
self again might be just semantics but
this radical shift

8208
02:13:28,870 --> 02:13:28,880
this radical shift
 

8209
02:13:28,880 --> 02:13:31,510
this radical shift
or sense of loss of sense of self or

8210
02:13:31,510 --> 02:13:31,520
or sense of loss of sense of self or
 

8211
02:13:31,520 --> 02:13:32,950
or sense of loss of sense of self or

8212

self boundaries
 

8213
02:13:32,960 --> 02:13:35,589
self boundaries
and that's like the most typically when

8214
02:13:35,589 --> 02:13:35,599
and that's like the most typically when
 

8215
02:13:35,599 --> 02:13:37,109
and that's like the most typically when
people have that experience they'll

8216
02:13:37,109 --> 02:13:37,119
people have that experience they'll
 

8217
02:13:37,119 --> 02:13:38,550
people have that experience they'll
often report that as being the most

8218
02:13:38,550 --> 02:13:38,560
often report that as being the most
 

8219
02:13:38,560 --> 02:13:39,910
often report that as being the most
remarkable

8220
02:13:39,910 --> 02:13:39,920
remarkable
 

8221
02:13:39,920 --> 02:13:41,030
remarkable

these deepest levels of the the nature

8226
02:13:45,589 --> 02:13:45,599
these deepest levels of the the nature
 

8227
02:13:45,599 --> 02:13:47,669
these deepest levels of the the nature
of reality itself the subjectivity and

of reality itself the subjectivity and
 

8229

like the the the seer

02:13:52,629 --> 02:13:52,639
like the the the seer
 

8233
02:13:52,639 --> 02:13:55,750
like the the the seer
and the scene become one and and it's a

and the scene become one and and it's a
 

8235

process
 

8237
02:13:57,119 --> 02:14:01,430
process
and yeah and they're able to bring that

8238
02:14:01,430 --> 02:14:01,440
and yeah and they're able to bring that
 

8239
02:14:01,440 --> 02:14:04,870
and yeah and they're able to bring that
experience back uh and be able to

8240
02:14:04,870 --> 02:14:04,880
experience back uh and be able to
 

8241
02:14:04,880 --> 02:14:06,550
experience back uh and be able to
describe it

8242
02:14:06,550 --> 02:14:06,560
describe it
 

8243
02:14:06,560 --> 02:14:09,430
describe it
yeah but but one of the to a degree but

8244
02:14:09,430 --> 02:14:09,440
yeah but but one of the to a degree but
 

8245
02:14:09,440 --> 02:14:10,870
yeah but but one of the to a degree but
one of the hallmarks going back to

8246
02:14:10,870 --> 02:14:10,880
one of the hallmarks going back to
 

8247
02:14:10,880 --> 02:14:12,870
one of the hallmarks going back to
william james of describing a mystical

8248
02:14:12,870 --> 02:14:12,880
william james of describing a mystical
 

8249
02:14:12,880 --> 02:14:15,430
william james of describing a mystical
experience as the inf ability

8250
02:14:15,430 --> 02:14:15,440
experience as the inf ability
 

8251
02:14:15,440 --> 02:14:17,350
experience as the inf ability
and so even though it's ineffable you

8252
02:14:17,350 --> 02:14:17,360
and so even though it's ineffable you
 

8253
02:14:17,360 --> 02:14:19,669
and so even though it's ineffable you
know people try as far as they can to

8254
02:14:19,669 --> 02:14:19,679
know people try as far as they can to
 

8255
02:14:19,679 --> 02:14:21,030
know people try as far as they can to
describe it but when you get the real

8256
02:14:21,030 --> 02:14:21,040
describe it but when you get the real
 

8257
02:14:21,040 --> 02:14:22,229
describe it but when you get the real
deal they'll say

8258
02:14:22,229 --> 02:14:22,239
deal they'll say
 

8259
02:14:22,239 --> 02:14:23,669
deal they'll say
and even say that they say a lot of

8260
02:14:23,669 --> 02:14:23,679
and even say that they say a lot of
 

8261
02:14:23,679 --> 02:14:25,510
and even say that they say a lot of
helpful things to help you describe the

8262
02:14:25,510 --> 02:14:25,520
helpful things to help you describe the
 

8263
02:14:25,520 --> 02:14:26,069
helpful things to help you describe the
landscape

8264
02:14:26,069 --> 02:14:26,079
landscape
 

8265
02:14:26,079 --> 02:14:28,629
landscape
they'll say no matter what i say i'm

8266
02:14:28,629 --> 02:14:28,639
they'll say no matter what i say i'm
 

8267
02:14:28,639 --> 02:14:30,390
they'll say no matter what i say i'm
still not even coming anywhere close to

8268
02:14:30,390 --> 02:14:30,400
still not even coming anywhere close to
 

8269
02:14:30,400 --> 02:14:31,350
still not even coming anywhere close to
what this was

8270
02:14:31,350 --> 02:14:31,360
what this was
 

8271
02:14:31,360 --> 02:14:33,830
what this was
like the language is completely failing

8272
02:14:33,830 --> 02:14:33,840
like the language is completely failing
 

8273
02:14:33,840 --> 02:14:35,589
like the language is completely failing
and i like to joke that even though it's

8274
02:14:35,589 --> 02:14:35,599
and i like to joke that even though it's
 

8275
02:14:35,599 --> 02:14:37,589
and i like to joke that even though it's
it's ineffable and we're researchers so

8276
02:14:37,589 --> 02:14:37,599
it's ineffable and we're researchers so
 

8277
02:14:37,599 --> 02:14:38,870
it's ineffable and we're researchers so
we try to eff it up

8278
02:14:38,870 --> 02:14:38,880
we try to eff it up
 

8279
02:14:38,880 --> 02:14:40,390
we try to eff it up
by asking them to describe the

8280
02:14:40,390 --> 02:14:40,400
by asking them to describe the
 

8281
02:14:40,400 --> 02:14:41,990
by asking them to describe the
experience

8282
02:14:41,990 --> 02:14:42,000
experience
 

8283
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:45,830
experience
i love it but to bring it back a little

8284
02:14:45,830 --> 02:14:45,840
i love it but to bring it back a little
 

8285
02:14:45,840 --> 02:14:46,149
i love it but to bring it back a little
bit

8286
02:14:46,149 --> 02:14:46,159
bit
 

8287
02:14:46,159 --> 02:14:50,229
bit
so for that particular study on tobacco

8288
02:14:50,229 --> 02:14:50,239
so for that particular study on tobacco
 

8289
02:14:50,239 --> 02:14:53,589
so for that particular study on tobacco
what was the results what was the

8290
02:14:53,589 --> 02:14:53,599
what was the results what was the
 

8291
02:14:53,599 --> 02:14:56,390
what was the results what was the
conclusions in terms of the uh impact of

8292
02:14:56,390 --> 02:14:56,400
conclusions in terms of the uh impact of
 

8293
02:14:56,400 --> 02:14:56,790
conclusions in terms of the uh impact of
uh

8294
02:14:56,790 --> 02:14:56,800
uh
 

8295
02:14:56,800 --> 02:14:59,510
uh
psilocybin on their addiction so when

8296
02:14:59,510 --> 02:14:59,520
psilocybin on their addiction so when
 

8297
02:14:59,520 --> 02:15:01,030
psilocybin on their addiction so when
that pilot study was very it was very

8298
02:15:01,030 --> 02:15:01,040
that pilot study was very it was very
 

8299
02:15:01,040 --> 02:15:03,030
that pilot study was very it was very
small and it wasn't a randomized study

8300
02:15:03,030 --> 02:15:03,040
small and it wasn't a randomized study
 

8301
02:15:03,040 --> 02:15:04,950
small and it wasn't a randomized study
so it was limited the only question we

8302
02:15:04,950 --> 02:15:04,960
so it was limited the only question we
 

8303
02:15:04,960 --> 02:15:06,229
so it was limited the only question we
could really answer was

8304
02:15:06,229 --> 02:15:06,239
could really answer was
 

8305
02:15:06,239 --> 02:15:08,390
could really answer was
is this worthy enough of follow-up yes

8306
02:15:08,390 --> 02:15:08,400
is this worthy enough of follow-up yes
 

8307
02:15:08,400 --> 02:15:09,990
is this worthy enough of follow-up yes
and the answer to that was absolutely

8308
02:15:09,990 --> 02:15:10,000
and the answer to that was absolutely
 

8309
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:10,870
and the answer to that was absolutely
freaking lutely

8310
02:15:10,870 --> 02:15:10,880
freaking lutely
 

8311
02:15:10,880 --> 02:15:12,390
freaking lutely
because the success rates were so high

8312
02:15:12,390 --> 02:15:12,400
because the success rates were so high
 

8313
02:15:12,400 --> 02:15:14,149
because the success rates were so high
eighty percent biologically confirmed

biologically confirmed abstinent at two
 

8321
02:15:20,079 --> 02:15:21,510
biologically confirmed abstinent at two
at an average of two and a half years a

8322
02:15:21,510 --> 02:15:21,520
at an average of two and a half years a
 

8323
02:15:21,520 --> 02:15:24,149
at an average of two and a half years a
very long time yeah and so

8324
02:15:24,149 --> 02:15:24,159
very long time yeah and so
 

8325
02:15:24,159 --> 02:15:26,310
very long time yeah and so
i mean the best that's been reported in

8326
02:15:26,310 --> 02:15:26,320
i mean the best that's been reported in
 

8327
02:15:26,320 --> 02:15:28,310
i mean the best that's been reported in
the literature for smoking cessation is

8328
02:15:28,310 --> 02:15:28,320
the literature for smoking cessation is
 

8329
02:15:28,320 --> 02:15:29,510
the literature for smoking cessation is
in the upper 50

8330
02:15:29,510 --> 02:15:29,520
in the upper 50
 

8331
02:15:29,520 --> 02:15:30,790
in the upper 50
and that's with not one but two

8332
02:15:30,790 --> 02:15:30,800
and that's with not one but two
 

8333
02:15:30,800 --> 02:15:32,790
and that's with not one but two
medications for a couple of months

8334
02:15:32,790 --> 02:15:32,800
medications for a couple of months
 

8335
02:15:32,800 --> 02:15:35,910
medications for a couple of months
followed by regular cognitive behavioral

8336
02:15:35,910 --> 02:15:35,920
followed by regular cognitive behavioral
 

8337
02:15:35,920 --> 02:15:37,270
followed by regular cognitive behavioral
therapy where you're coming in once a

8338
02:15:37,270 --> 02:15:37,280
therapy where you're coming in once a
 

8339
02:15:37,280 --> 02:15:39,030
therapy where you're coming in once a
week or once every few weeks for an

8340
02:15:39,030 --> 02:15:39,040
week or once every few weeks for an
 

8341
02:15:39,040 --> 02:15:39,669
week or once every few weeks for an
entire

8342
02:15:39,669 --> 02:15:39,679
entire
 

8343
02:15:39,679 --> 02:15:43,430
entire
year and and so but this is what

8344
02:15:43,430 --> 02:15:43,440
year and and so but this is what
 

8345
02:15:43,440 --> 02:15:46,790
year and and so but this is what
very heavy this is just like a few uses

8346
02:15:46,790 --> 02:15:46,800
very heavy this is just like a few uses
 

8347
02:15:46,800 --> 02:15:49,189
very heavy this is just like a few uses
of uh psilocybin so this was three doses

8348
02:15:49,189 --> 02:15:49,199
of uh psilocybin so this was three doses
 

8349
02:15:49,199 --> 02:15:50,390
of uh psilocybin so this was three doses
of psilocybin over

8350
02:15:50,390 --> 02:15:50,400
of psilocybin over
 

8351
02:15:50,400 --> 02:15:52,149
of psilocybin over
a total course including preparation

8352
02:15:52,149 --> 02:15:52,159
a total course including preparation
 

8353
02:15:52,159 --> 02:15:53,589
a total course including preparation
everything a 15-week

8354
02:15:53,589 --> 02:15:53,599
everything a 15-week
 

8355
02:15:53,599 --> 02:15:56,390
everything a 15-week
period where there's mainly like um for

8356
02:15:56,390 --> 02:15:56,400
period where there's mainly like um for
 

8357
02:15:56,400 --> 02:15:57,270
period where there's mainly like um for
most part one

8358
02:15:57,270 --> 02:15:57,280
most part one
 

8359
02:15:57,280 --> 02:15:59,109
most part one
one meeting a week and then the three

8360
02:15:59,109 --> 02:15:59,119
one meeting a week and then the three
 

8361
02:15:59,119 --> 02:16:00,629
one meeting a week and then the three
sessions are within that

8362
02:16:00,629 --> 02:16:00,639
sessions are within that
 

8363
02:16:00,639 --> 02:16:02,870
sessions are within that
and so it's and we scale that back in

8364
02:16:02,870 --> 02:16:02,880
and so it's and we scale that back in
 

8365
02:16:02,880 --> 02:16:03,669
and so it's and we scale that back in
the more

8366
02:16:03,669 --> 02:16:03,679
the more
 

8367
02:16:03,679 --> 02:16:05,350
the more
the the study we're doing right now

8368
02:16:05,350 --> 02:16:05,360
the the study we're doing right now
 

8369
02:16:05,360 --> 02:16:06,790
the the study we're doing right now
which i can tell you about which is a

8370
02:16:06,790 --> 02:16:06,800
which i can tell you about which is a
 

8371
02:16:06,800 --> 02:16:07,910
which i can tell you about which is a
randomized um

8372
02:16:07,910 --> 02:16:07,920
randomized um
 

8373
02:16:07,920 --> 02:16:11,910
randomized um
controlled trial um but but it's uh

8374
02:16:11,910 --> 02:16:11,920
controlled trial um but but it's uh
 

8375
02:16:11,920 --> 02:16:15,990
controlled trial um but but it's uh
the yeah the original um

8376
02:16:15,990 --> 02:16:16,000
the yeah the original um
 

8377
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:19,109
the yeah the original um
you know pilot study was you know these

8378
02:16:19,109 --> 02:16:19,119
you know pilot study was you know these
 

8379
02:16:19,119 --> 02:16:20,390
you know pilot study was you know these
15 people

8380
02:16:20,390 --> 02:16:20,400
15 people
 

8381
02:16:20,400 --> 02:16:22,310
15 people
so given the like the positive signal

8382
02:16:22,310 --> 02:16:22,320
so given the like the positive signal
 

8383
02:16:22,320 --> 02:16:23,830
so given the like the positive signal
from the first study telling us that it

8384
02:16:23,830 --> 02:16:23,840
from the first study telling us that it
 

8385
02:16:23,840 --> 02:16:25,510
from the first study telling us that it
was a worthy pursuit we hustled up some

8386
02:16:25,510 --> 02:16:25,520
was a worthy pursuit we hustled up some
 

8387
02:16:25,520 --> 02:16:26,470
was a worthy pursuit we hustled up some
money to actually

8388
02:16:26,470 --> 02:16:26,480
money to actually
 

8389
02:16:26,480 --> 02:16:28,790
money to actually
be able to afford a larger trial so it's

8390
02:16:28,790 --> 02:16:28,800
be able to afford a larger trial so it's
 

8391
02:16:28,800 --> 02:16:30,470
be able to afford a larger trial so it's
randomizing 80 people

8392
02:16:30,470 --> 02:16:30,480
randomizing 80 people
 

8393
02:16:30,480 --> 02:16:33,429
randomizing 80 people
to to get either one psilocybin session

8394
02:16:33,429 --> 02:16:33,439
to to get either one psilocybin session
 

8395
02:16:33,439 --> 02:16:34,309
to to get either one psilocybin session
when we've narrowed

8396
02:16:34,309 --> 02:16:34,319
when we've narrowed
 

8397
02:16:34,319 --> 02:16:36,549
when we've narrowed
we we've scaled that down from three to

8398
02:16:36,549 --> 02:16:36,559
we we've scaled that down from three to
 

8399
02:16:36,559 --> 02:16:39,190
we we've scaled that down from three to
one mainly because we're doing fmri

8400
02:16:39,190 --> 02:16:39,200
one mainly because we're doing fmri
 

8401
02:16:39,200 --> 02:16:40,629
one mainly because we're doing fmri
neuro imaging before and after and it

8402
02:16:40,629 --> 02:16:40,639
neuro imaging before and after and it
 

8403
02:16:40,639 --> 02:16:42,790
neuro imaging before and after and it
made it more experimentally complex to

8404
02:16:42,790 --> 02:16:42,800
made it more experimentally complex to
 

8405
02:16:42,800 --> 02:16:45,429
made it more experimentally complex to
have multiple sessions um but one

8406
02:16:45,429 --> 02:16:45,439
have multiple sessions um but one
 

8407
02:16:45,439 --> 02:16:47,509
have multiple sessions um but one
psilocybin session versus

8408
02:16:47,509 --> 02:16:47,519
psilocybin session versus
 

8409
02:16:47,519 --> 02:16:51,030
psilocybin session versus
uh the nicotine patch using the the fda

8410
02:16:51,030 --> 02:16:51,040
uh the nicotine patch using the the fda
 

8411
02:16:51,040 --> 02:16:53,110
uh the nicotine patch using the the fda
approved label like standard use of the

8412
02:16:53,110 --> 02:16:53,120
approved label like standard use of the
 

8413
02:16:53,120 --> 02:16:54,870
approved label like standard use of the
nicotine patch so it's randomized 40

8414
02:16:54,870 --> 02:16:54,880
nicotine patch so it's randomized 40
 

8415
02:16:54,880 --> 02:16:55,669
nicotine patch so it's randomized 40
people get

8416
02:16:55,669 --> 02:16:55,679
people get
 

8417
02:16:55,679 --> 02:16:58,389
people get
randomized to psilocybin one session 40

8418
02:16:58,389 --> 02:16:58,399
randomized to psilocybin one session 40
 

8419
02:16:58,399 --> 02:16:59,990
randomized to psilocybin one session 40
people get nicotine patch

8420
02:16:59,990 --> 02:17:00,000
people get nicotine patch
 

8421
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:01,349
people get nicotine patch
and they all get the same cognitive

8422
02:17:01,349 --> 02:17:01,359
and they all get the same cognitive
 

8423
02:17:01,359 --> 02:17:03,190
and they all get the same cognitive
behavioral therapy for the standard talk

8424
02:17:03,190 --> 02:17:03,200
behavioral therapy for the standard talk
 

8425
02:17:03,200 --> 02:17:03,830

therapy

8426
02:17:03,830 --> 02:17:03,840
therapy
 

8427
02:17:03,840 --> 02:17:05,349
therapy
and we've scaled it down somewhat so

8428
02:17:05,349 --> 02:17:05,359
and we've scaled it down somewhat so
 

8429
02:17:05,359 --> 02:17:07,349
and we've scaled it down somewhat so
there's less a weekly meetings but

8430
02:17:07,349 --> 02:17:07,359
there's less a weekly meetings but
 

8431
02:17:07,359 --> 02:17:09,750
there's less a weekly meetings but
it's within the same ballpark and right

8432
02:17:09,750 --> 02:17:09,760
it's within the same ballpark and right
 

8433
02:17:09,760 --> 02:17:10,629
it's within the same ballpark and right
now we're still

8434
02:17:10,629 --> 02:17:10,639
now we're still
 

8435
02:17:10,639 --> 02:17:15,030
now we're still
um uh uh uh uh the study's still

8436
02:17:15,030 --> 02:17:15,040
um uh uh uh uh the study's still
 

8437
02:17:15,040 --> 02:17:17,190
um uh uh uh uh the study's still
ongoing and in fact we just recently

8438
02:17:17,190 --> 02:17:17,200
ongoing and in fact we just recently
 

8439
02:17:17,200 --> 02:17:19,030
ongoing and in fact we just recently
started recruiting again we paused for

8440
02:17:19,030 --> 02:17:19,040
started recruiting again we paused for
 

8441
02:17:19,040 --> 02:17:20,150
started recruiting again we paused for
covet now we're

8442
02:17:20,150 --> 02:17:20,160
covet now we're
 

8443
02:17:20,160 --> 02:17:21,669
covet now we're
starting back up with some protections

8444
02:17:21,669 --> 02:17:21,679
starting back up with some protections
 

8445
02:17:21,679 --> 02:17:23,190
starting back up with some protections
like masks and whatnot

8446
02:17:23,190 --> 02:17:23,200
like masks and whatnot
 

8447
02:17:23,200 --> 02:17:27,509
like masks and whatnot
but um uh right now for the 44

8448
02:17:27,509 --> 02:17:27,519
but um uh right now for the 44
 

8449
02:17:27,519 --> 02:17:29,910
but um uh right now for the 44
people who have gotten through the

8450
02:17:29,910 --> 02:17:29,920
people who have gotten through the
 

8451
02:17:29,920 --> 02:17:31,589
people who have gotten through the
one-year follow-up and so that includes

8452
02:17:31,589 --> 02:17:31,599
one-year follow-up and so that includes
 

8453
02:17:31,599 --> 02:17:33,349
one-year follow-up and so that includes
22 from each of the two groups

8454
02:17:33,349 --> 02:17:33,359
22 from each of the two groups
 

8455
02:17:33,359 --> 02:17:36,230
22 from each of the two groups
the success rates are extremely high for

8456
02:17:36,230 --> 02:17:36,240
the success rates are extremely high for
 

8457
02:17:36,240 --> 02:17:37,429
the success rates are extremely high for
the psilocybin group

8458
02:17:37,429 --> 02:17:37,439
the psilocybin group
 

8459
02:17:37,439 --> 02:17:40,389
the psilocybin group
it's 59 have been biologically confirmed

8460
02:17:40,389 --> 02:17:40,399
it's 59 have been biologically confirmed
 

8461
02:17:40,399 --> 02:17:42,230
it's 59 have been biologically confirmed
as smoke-free at one year

8462
02:17:42,230 --> 02:17:42,240
as smoke-free at one year
 

8463
02:17:42,240 --> 02:17:44,950
as smoke-free at one year
after their quit date and that compares

8464
02:17:44,950 --> 02:17:44,960
after their quit date and that compares
 

8465
02:17:44,960 --> 02:17:45,669
after their quit date and that compares
to

8466
02:17:45,669 --> 02:17:45,679
to
 

8467
02:17:45,679 --> 02:17:48,150
to
27 percent for the nicotine patch which

8468
02:17:48,150 --> 02:17:48,160
27 percent for the nicotine patch which
 

8469
02:17:48,160 --> 02:17:49,910
27 percent for the nicotine patch which
by the way is extremely good for the

8470
02:17:49,910 --> 02:17:49,920
by the way is extremely good for the
 

8471
02:17:49,920 --> 02:17:51,830
by the way is extremely good for the
nicotine patch compared to previous

8472
02:17:51,830 --> 02:17:51,840
nicotine patch compared to previous
 

8473
02:17:51,840 --> 02:17:52,950
nicotine patch compared to previous
research

8474
02:17:52,950 --> 02:17:52,960
research
 

8475
02:17:52,960 --> 02:17:55,509
research
so the results could change because it's

8476
02:17:55,509 --> 02:17:55,519
so the results could change because it's
 

8477
02:17:55,519 --> 02:17:56,790
so the results could change because it's
ongoing

8478
02:17:56,790 --> 02:17:56,800
ongoing
 

8479
02:17:56,800 --> 02:17:59,110
ongoing
but we're mostly done and it's still

8480
02:17:59,110 --> 02:17:59,120
but we're mostly done and it's still
 

8481
02:17:59,120 --> 02:18:00,709
but we're mostly done and it's still
looking extremely

8482
02:18:00,709 --> 02:18:00,719
looking extremely
 

8483
02:18:00,719 --> 02:18:02,309
looking extremely
positive so if anyone's interested they

8484
02:18:02,309 --> 02:18:02,319
positive so if anyone's interested they
 

8485
02:18:02,319 --> 02:18:03,910
positive so if anyone's interested they
have to be sort of be in commuting

8486
02:18:03,910 --> 02:18:03,920
have to be sort of be in commuting
 

8487
02:18:03,920 --> 02:18:05,910
have to be sort of be in commuting
distance to the baltimore area but

8488
02:18:05,910 --> 02:18:05,920
distance to the baltimore area but
 

8489
02:18:05,920 --> 02:18:08,230
distance to the baltimore area but
you know to participate right right to

8490
02:18:08,230 --> 02:18:08,240
you know to participate right right to
 

8491
02:18:08,240 --> 02:18:09,509
you know to participate right right to

participate
this is uh this is a good moment to

8494
02:18:11,910 --> 02:18:11,920
this is uh this is a good moment to
 

8495
02:18:11,920 --> 02:18:13,509
this is uh this is a good moment to
bring up something

8496
02:18:13,509 --> 02:18:13,519
bring up something
 

8497
02:18:13,519 --> 02:18:15,830
bring up something
i think a lot of what you talked about

8498
02:18:15,830 --> 02:18:15,840
i think a lot of what you talked about
 

8499
02:18:15,840 --> 02:18:17,669
i think a lot of what you talked about
is super interesting

8500
02:18:17,669 --> 02:18:17,679
is super interesting
 

8501
02:18:17,679 --> 02:18:19,589
is super interesting
and i think a lot of people listening to

8502
02:18:19,589 --> 02:18:19,599
and i think a lot of people listening to
 

8503
02:18:19,599 --> 02:18:22,230
and i think a lot of people listening to
this so now it's

we don't have a study on it now and if

8586
02:19:42,709 --> 02:19:42,719
we don't have a study on it now and if
 

8587
02:19:42,719 --> 02:19:43,910
we don't have a study on it now and if
you're interested in psychedelic

8588
02:19:43,910 --> 02:19:43,920
you're interested in psychedelic
 

8589
02:19:43,920 --> 02:19:44,870
you're interested in psychedelic
research

8590
02:19:44,870 --> 02:19:44,880
research
 

8591
02:19:44,880 --> 02:19:47,110
research
more broadly you can look up you know

8592
02:19:47,110 --> 02:19:47,120
more broadly you can look up you know
 

8593
02:19:47,120 --> 02:19:48,630
more broadly you can look up you know
like at another university that might be

8594
02:19:48,630 --> 02:19:48,640
like at another university that might be
 

8595
02:19:48,640 --> 02:19:50,230
like at another university that might be
closer to you and there's a handful of

8596
02:19:50,230 --> 02:19:50,240
closer to you and there's a handful of
 

8597
02:19:50,240 --> 02:19:50,710
closer to you and there's a handful of
them now

8598
02:19:50,710 --> 02:19:50,720
them now
 

8599
02:19:50,720 --> 02:19:52,790
them now
across the country and there's some in

8600
02:19:52,790 --> 02:19:52,800
across the country and there's some in
 

8601
02:19:52,800 --> 02:19:54,150
across the country and there's some in
europe that that um

8602
02:19:54,150 --> 02:19:54,160
europe that that um
 

8603
02:19:54,160 --> 02:19:55,429
europe that that um
have studies going on but you can at

8604
02:19:55,429 --> 02:19:55,439
have studies going on but you can at
 

8605
02:19:55,439 --> 02:19:58,830
have studies going on but you can at
least in the us you can look at

8606
02:19:58,830 --> 02:19:58,840
least in the us you can look at
 

8607
02:19:58,840 --> 02:20:01,030
least in the us you can look at
clinicaltrials.gov and and look up the

8608
02:20:01,030 --> 02:20:01,040
clinicaltrials.gov and and look up the
 

8609
02:20:01,040 --> 02:20:02,870
clinicaltrials.gov and and look up the
term psilocybin and in fact

8610
02:20:02,870 --> 02:20:02,880
term psilocybin and in fact
 

8611
02:20:02,880 --> 02:20:04,469
term psilocybin and in fact
optionally people even in europe can

8612
02:20:04,469 --> 02:20:04,479
optionally people even in europe can
 

8613
02:20:04,479 --> 02:20:05,990
optionally people even in europe can
register their trial on there

8614
02:20:05,990 --> 02:20:06,000
register their trial on there
 

8615
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:07,990
register their trial on there
so that's a good way to find studies but

8616
02:20:07,990 --> 02:20:08,000
so that's a good way to find studies but
 

8617
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:09,510
so that's a good way to find studies but
for our research

8618
02:20:09,510 --> 02:20:09,520
for our research
 

8619
02:20:09,520 --> 02:20:11,830
for our research
rather than emailing me like a more

8620
02:20:11,830 --> 02:20:11,840
rather than emailing me like a more
 

8621
02:20:11,840 --> 02:20:12,630
rather than emailing me like a more
efficient way

8622
02:20:12,630 --> 02:20:12,640
efficient way
 

8623
02:20:12,640 --> 02:20:14,309
efficient way
is to go straight and you can do that

8624
02:20:14,309 --> 02:20:14,319
is to go straight and you can do that
 

8625
02:20:14,319 --> 02:20:17,030
is to go straight and you can do that
first the first phase of screening

first the first phase of screening
 

8627
02:20:17,040 --> 02:20:18,950

uh it's been quite heartbreaking
because i basically don't respond to any

response
 

8699
02:21:28,960 --> 02:21:31,670
response
is then you're starting a conversation

8700
02:21:31,670 --> 02:21:31,680
is then you're starting a conversation

i'm thinking of that in two categories

8986
02:26:08,389 --> 02:26:08,399
i'm thinking of that in two categories
 

8987
02:26:08,399 --> 02:26:11,510
i'm thinking of that in two categories
one kind of more

8988
02:26:11,510 --> 02:26:11,520
one kind of more
 

8989
02:26:11,520 --> 02:26:13,750
one kind of more
more scientific and they're both

8990
02:26:13,750 --> 02:26:13,760
more scientific and they're both
 

8991
02:26:13,760 --> 02:26:14,710
more scientific and they're both
scientific but

8992
02:26:14,710 --> 02:26:14,720
scientific but
 

8993
02:26:14,720 --> 02:26:17,670
scientific but
um one more about you know more about

8994
02:26:17,670 --> 02:26:17,680
um one more about you know more about
 

8995
02:26:17,680 --> 02:26:18,950
um one more about you know more about
the

8996
02:26:18,950 --> 02:26:18,960
the
 

8997
02:26:18,960 --> 02:26:21,429
the
the brain and behavior and the mind so

8998
02:26:21,429 --> 02:26:21,439
the brain and behavior and the mind so
 

8999
02:26:21,439 --> 02:26:22,630
the brain and behavior and the mind so
to speak

9000
02:26:22,630 --> 02:26:22,640
to speak
 

9001
02:26:22,640 --> 02:26:24,550
to speak
and and as a behaviorist always see sort

9002
02:26:24,550 --> 02:26:24,560
and and as a behaviorist always see sort
 

9003
02:26:24,560 --> 02:26:27,190
and and as a behaviorist always see sort
of the mind as a metaphor for

9004
02:26:27,190 --> 02:26:27,200
of the mind as a metaphor for
 

9005
02:26:27,200 --> 02:26:29,030
of the mind as a metaphor for
behavior so but anyway that gets

9006
02:26:29,030 --> 02:26:29,040
behavior so but anyway that gets
 

9007
02:26:29,040 --> 02:26:30,790
behavior so but anyway that gets
philosophical

9008
02:26:30,790 --> 02:26:30,800
philosophical
 

9009
02:26:30,800 --> 02:26:34,710
philosophical
but it's really increasing the

9010
02:26:34,710 --> 02:26:34,720
but it's really increasing the
 

9011
02:26:34,720 --> 02:26:37,190
but it's really increasing the
the so the one category is increasing

9012
02:26:37,190 --> 02:26:37,200
the so the one category is increasing
 

9013
02:26:37,200 --> 02:26:38,389
the so the one category is increasing
the

9014
02:26:38,389 --> 02:26:38,399
the
 

9015
02:26:38,399 --> 02:26:42,550
the
appreciation for the magnitude of

9016
02:26:42,550 --> 02:26:42,560
appreciation for the magnitude of
 

9017
02:26:42,560 --> 02:26:44,870
appreciation for the magnitude of
depth i mean so these are all metaphors

9018
02:26:44,870 --> 02:26:44,880
depth i mean so these are all metaphors
 

9019
02:26:44,880 --> 02:26:45,990
depth i mean so these are all metaphors
of

9020
02:26:45,990 --> 02:26:46,000
of
 

9021
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:48,469
of
of human experience that might be a good

9022
02:26:48,469 --> 02:26:48,479
of human experience that might be a good
 

9023
02:26:48,479 --> 02:26:49,750
of human experience that might be a good
way to because you use certain words

9024
02:26:49,750 --> 02:26:49,760
way to because you use certain words
 

9025
02:26:49,760 --> 02:26:51,270
way to because you use certain words
like consciousness and what

9026
02:26:51,270 --> 02:26:51,280
like consciousness and what
 

9027
02:26:51,280 --> 02:26:53,670
like consciousness and what
it's like we're using constructs that

9028
02:26:53,670 --> 02:26:53,680
it's like we're using constructs that
 

9029
02:26:53,680 --> 02:26:55,110
it's like we're using constructs that
aren't well defined

9030
02:26:55,110 --> 02:26:55,120
aren't well defined
 

9031
02:26:55,120 --> 02:26:57,830
aren't well defined
and unless we kind of dig in but in

9032
02:26:57,830 --> 02:26:57,840
and unless we kind of dig in but in
 

9033
02:26:57,840 --> 02:26:59,670
and unless we kind of dig in but in
human experience

9034
02:26:59,670 --> 02:26:59,680
human experience
 

9035
02:26:59,680 --> 02:27:02,710
human experience
like that the experiences on these

9036
02:27:02,710 --> 02:27:02,720
like that the experiences on these
 

9037
02:27:02,720 --> 02:27:03,750
like that the experiences on these
compounds

9038
02:27:03,750 --> 02:27:03,760
compounds
 

9039
02:27:03,760 --> 02:27:08,309
compounds
can be so far out there or so deep

9040
02:27:08,309 --> 02:27:08,319
can be so far out there or so deep
 

9041
02:27:08,319 --> 02:27:10,230
can be so far out there or so deep
and that like and they're doing that by

9042
02:27:10,230 --> 02:27:10,240
and that like and they're doing that by
 

9043
02:27:10,240 --> 02:27:12,230
and that like and they're doing that by
tinkering with the same machinery that's

9044
02:27:12,230 --> 02:27:12,240
tinkering with the same machinery that's
 

9045
02:27:12,240 --> 02:27:14,870
tinkering with the same machinery that's
going on up there i mean i'm

9046
02:27:14,870 --> 02:27:14,880
going on up there i mean i'm
 

9047
02:27:14,880 --> 02:27:16,790
going on up there i mean i'm
my assumption and i think it's a good

9048
02:27:16,790 --> 02:27:16,800
my assumption and i think it's a good
 

9049
02:27:16,800 --> 02:27:17,990
my assumption and i think it's a good
assumption is that all

9050
02:27:17,990 --> 02:27:18,000
assumption is that all
 

9051
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:20,309
assumption is that all
experiences you know there's a there's a

9052
02:27:20,309 --> 02:27:20,319
experiences you know there's a there's a
 

9053
02:27:20,319 --> 02:27:22,150
experiences you know there's a there's a
biological side

9054
02:27:22,150 --> 02:27:22,160
biological side
 

9055
02:27:22,160 --> 02:27:25,429
biological side
to all phenomenal experience

9056
02:27:25,429 --> 02:27:25,439
to all phenomenal experience
 

9057
02:27:25,439 --> 02:27:27,429
to all phenomenal experience
you know so there is not you know the

9058
02:27:27,429 --> 02:27:27,439
you know so there is not you know the
 

9059
02:27:27,439 --> 02:27:29,429
you know so there is not you know the
divide between biology

9060
02:27:29,429 --> 02:27:29,439
divide between biology
 

9061
02:27:29,439 --> 02:27:32,630
divide between biology
you know and and um

9062
02:27:32,630 --> 02:27:32,640
you know and and um
 

9063
02:27:32,640 --> 02:27:36,150
you know and and um
and experience or psychology is

9064
02:27:36,150 --> 02:27:36,160
and experience or psychology is
 

9065
02:27:36,160 --> 02:27:37,990
and experience or psychology is
is it's you know it's not one or the

9066
02:27:37,990 --> 02:27:38,000
is it's you know it's not one or the
 

9067
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:39,670
is it's you know it's not one or the
other these are just two you know two

9068
02:27:39,670 --> 02:27:39,680
other these are just two you know two
 

9069
02:27:39,680 --> 02:27:42,070
other these are just two you know two
sides of the same

9070
02:27:42,070 --> 02:27:42,080
sides of the same
 

9071
02:27:42,080 --> 02:27:44,870
sides of the same
coin i mean you're avoiding the the word

9072
02:27:44,870 --> 02:27:44,880
coin i mean you're avoiding the the word
 

9073
02:27:44,880 --> 02:27:45,670
coin i mean you're avoiding the the word
the use

9074
02:27:45,670 --> 02:27:45,680
the use
 

9075
02:27:45,680 --> 02:27:47,429
the use
of the word consciousness for example

9076
02:27:47,429 --> 02:27:47,439
of the word consciousness for example
 

9077
02:27:47,439 --> 02:27:49,510
of the word consciousness for example
but the experience is referring to

9078
02:27:49,510 --> 02:27:49,520
but the experience is referring to
 

9079
02:27:49,520 --> 02:27:51,510
but the experience is referring to
the subjective experience so it's it's

9080
02:27:51,510 --> 02:27:51,520
the subjective experience so it's it's
 

9081
02:27:51,520 --> 02:27:53,510
the subjective experience so it's it's
the actual technical use of the word

9082
02:27:53,510 --> 02:27:53,520
the actual technical use of the word
 

9083
02:27:53,520 --> 02:27:55,270
the actual technical use of the word
consciousness of

9084
02:27:55,270 --> 02:27:55,280
consciousness of
 

9085
02:27:55,280 --> 02:27:57,990
consciousness of
of yeah subjective experience and even

9086
02:27:57,990 --> 02:27:58,000
of yeah subjective experience and even
 

9087
02:27:58,000 --> 02:27:58,550
of yeah subjective experience and even
that word

9088
02:27:58,550 --> 02:27:58,560
that word
 

9089
02:27:58,560 --> 02:28:00,150
that word
there are certain ways that like like

9090
02:28:00,150 --> 02:28:00,160
there are certain ways that like like
 

9091
02:28:00,160 --> 02:28:01,590
there are certain ways that like like
sort of like we're talking about access

9092
02:28:01,590 --> 02:28:01,600
sort of like we're talking about access
 

9093
02:28:01,600 --> 02:28:03,349
sort of like we're talking about access
consciousness or

9094
02:28:03,349 --> 02:28:03,359
consciousness or
 

9095
02:28:03,359 --> 02:28:05,110
consciousness or
narrative self-awareness which is an

9096
02:28:05,110 --> 02:28:05,120
narrative self-awareness which is an
 

9097
02:28:05,120 --> 02:28:06,710
narrative self-awareness which is an
aspect of like

9098
02:28:06,710 --> 02:28:06,720
aspect of like
 

9099
02:28:06,720 --> 02:28:08,309
aspect of like
you can wrap a definition around that we

9100
02:28:08,309 --> 02:28:08,319
you can wrap a definition around that we
 

9101
02:28:08,319 --> 02:28:09,990
you can wrap a definition around that we
can talk meaningfully about it but so

9102
02:28:09,990 --> 02:28:10,000
can talk meaningfully about it but so
 

9103
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:11,510
can talk meaningfully about it but so
often around psychedelics it's used in

9104
02:28:11,510 --> 02:28:11,520
often around psychedelics it's used in
 

9105
02:28:11,520 --> 02:28:12,710
often around psychedelics it's used in
this much more

9106
02:28:12,710 --> 02:28:12,720
this much more
 

9107
02:28:12,720 --> 02:28:15,270
this much more
in terms of ultimately explaining

9108
02:28:15,270 --> 02:28:15,280
in terms of ultimately explaining
 

9109
02:28:15,280 --> 02:28:17,110
in terms of ultimately explaining
phenomenal consciousness itself the

9110
02:28:17,110 --> 02:28:17,120
phenomenal consciousness itself the
 

9111
02:28:17,120 --> 02:28:17,990
phenomenal consciousness itself the
so-called hard

9112
02:28:17,990 --> 02:28:18,000
so-called hard
 

9113
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:21,110
so-called hard
problem and you know uh

9114
02:28:21,110 --> 02:28:21,120
problem and you know uh
 

9115
02:28:21,120 --> 02:28:22,790
problem and you know uh
relating to that question and

9116
02:28:22,790 --> 02:28:22,800
relating to that question and
 

9117
02:28:22,800 --> 02:28:24,550
relating to that question and
psychedelics really haven't

9118
02:28:24,550 --> 02:28:24,560
psychedelics really haven't
 

9119
02:28:24,560 --> 02:28:26,870
psychedelics really haven't
spoken to that and that's why it's hard

9120
02:28:26,870 --> 02:28:26,880
spoken to that and that's why it's hard
 

9121
02:28:26,880 --> 02:28:28,070
spoken to that and that's why it's hard
because like it's hard to imagine

9122
02:28:28,070 --> 02:28:28,080
because like it's hard to imagine
 

9123
02:28:28,080 --> 02:28:28,790
because like it's hard to imagine
anything

9124
02:28:28,790 --> 02:28:28,800
anything
 

9125
02:28:28,800 --> 02:28:31,429
anything
but i think what i was getting is that

9126
02:28:31,429 --> 02:28:31,439
but i think what i was getting is that
 

9127
02:28:31,439 --> 02:28:33,750
but i think what i was getting is that
psychedelics have done this by

9128
02:28:33,750 --> 02:28:33,760
psychedelics have done this by
 

9129
02:28:33,760 --> 02:28:34,870
psychedelics have done this by
the reason i was getting into the

9130
02:28:34,870 --> 02:28:34,880
the reason i was getting into the
 

9131
02:28:34,880 --> 02:28:36,870
the reason i was getting into the
biology versus mind

9132
02:28:36,870 --> 02:28:36,880
biology versus mind
 

9133
02:28:36,880 --> 02:28:39,990
biology versus mind
psychology divide is that that

9134
02:28:39,990 --> 02:28:40,000
psychology divide is that that
 

9135
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:42,230
psychology divide is that that
just to kind of set up the fact that i

9136
02:28:42,230 --> 02:28:42,240
just to kind of set up the fact that i
 

9137
02:28:42,240 --> 02:28:43,910
just to kind of set up the fact that i
think all of our experience

9138
02:28:43,910 --> 02:28:43,920
think all of our experience
 

9139
02:28:43,920 --> 02:28:47,190
think all of our experience
is related to these

9140
02:28:47,190 --> 02:28:47,200
is related to these
 

9141
02:28:47,200 --> 02:28:50,150
is related to these
biological events so whether they be

9142
02:28:50,150 --> 02:28:50,160
biological events so whether they be
 

9143
02:28:50,160 --> 02:28:52,630
biological events so whether they be
naturally occurring neurotransmitters

9144
02:28:52,630 --> 02:28:52,640
naturally occurring neurotransmitters
 

9145
02:28:52,640 --> 02:28:54,309
naturally occurring neurotransmitters
like serotonin and dopamine and

9146
02:28:54,309 --> 02:28:54,319
like serotonin and dopamine and
 

9147
02:28:54,319 --> 02:28:56,309
like serotonin and dopamine and
norepinephrine etc

9148
02:28:56,309 --> 02:28:56,319
norepinephrine etc
 

9149
02:28:56,319 --> 02:28:58,309
norepinephrine etc
and and a whole other sort of biological

9150
02:28:58,309 --> 02:28:58,319
and and a whole other sort of biological
 

9151
02:28:58,319 --> 02:29:00,469
and and a whole other sort of biological
activity and kind of

9152
02:29:00,469 --> 02:29:00,479
activity and kind of
 

9153
02:29:00,479 --> 02:29:01,910
activity and kind of
another layer up that we could talk

9154
02:29:01,910 --> 02:29:01,920
another layer up that we could talk
 

9155
02:29:01,920 --> 02:29:04,070
another layer up that we could talk
about network activity communication

9156
02:29:04,070 --> 02:29:04,080
about network activity communication
 

9157
02:29:04,080 --> 02:29:05,270
about network activity communication
amongst brain areas like

9158
02:29:05,270 --> 02:29:05,280
amongst brain areas like
 

9159
02:29:05,280 --> 02:29:07,270
amongst brain areas like
this is always going on even if i just

9160
02:29:07,270 --> 02:29:07,280
this is always going on even if i just
 

9161
02:29:07,280 --> 02:29:08,710
this is always going on even if i just
prompt you to think about

9162
02:29:08,710 --> 02:29:08,720
prompt you to think about
 

9163
02:29:08,720 --> 02:29:10,790
prompt you to think about
a loved one you know like there's

9164
02:29:10,790 --> 02:29:10,800
a loved one you know like there's
 

9165
02:29:10,800 --> 02:29:13,349
a loved one you know like there's
something happening biologically

9166
02:29:13,349 --> 02:29:13,359
something happening biologically
 

9167
02:29:13,359 --> 02:29:15,349
something happening biologically
okay so that's always another side of

9168
02:29:15,349 --> 02:29:15,359
okay so that's always another side of
 

9169
02:29:15,359 --> 02:29:17,429
okay so that's always another side of
the coin so

9170
02:29:17,429 --> 02:29:17,439
the coin so
 

9171
02:29:17,439 --> 02:29:18,950
the coin so
and another way to put that is all of

9172
02:29:18,950 --> 02:29:18,960
and another way to put that is all of
 

9173
02:29:18,960 --> 02:29:20,790
and another way to put that is all of
our subjective experience outside of

9174
02:29:20,790 --> 02:29:20,800
our subjective experience outside of
 

9175
02:29:20,800 --> 02:29:21,590
our subjective experience outside of
drugs

9176
02:29:21,590 --> 02:29:21,600
drugs
 

9177
02:29:21,600 --> 02:29:25,670
drugs
it's it's all a controlled hallucination

9178
02:29:25,670 --> 02:29:25,680
it's it's all a controlled hallucination
 

9179
02:29:25,680 --> 02:29:28,150
it's it's all a controlled hallucination
in a sense it like this is completely

9180
02:29:28,150 --> 02:29:28,160
in a sense it like this is completely
 

9181
02:29:28,160 --> 02:29:29,830
in a sense it like this is completely
constructed our our experience of

9182
02:29:29,830 --> 02:29:29,840
constructed our our experience of
 

9183
02:29:29,840 --> 02:29:32,469
constructed our our experience of
reality is completely

9184
02:29:32,469 --> 02:29:32,479
reality is completely
 

9185
02:29:32,479 --> 02:29:35,110
reality is completely
a simulation so i i think we're on on

9186
02:29:35,110 --> 02:29:35,120
a simulation so i i think we're on on
 

9187
02:29:35,120 --> 02:29:36,950
a simulation so i i think we're on on
solid ground to say that that's our best

9188
02:29:36,950 --> 02:29:36,960
solid ground to say that that's our best
 

9189
02:29:36,960 --> 02:29:38,309
solid ground to say that that's our best
guess and that's a pretty reasonable

9190
02:29:38,309 --> 02:29:38,319
guess and that's a pretty reasonable
 

9191
02:29:38,319 --> 02:29:38,950
guess and that's a pretty reasonable
thing to

9192
02:29:38,950 --> 02:29:38,960
thing to
 

9193
02:29:38,960 --> 02:29:41,429
thing to
to to say scientifically like all the

9194
02:29:41,429 --> 02:29:41,439
to to say scientifically like all the
 

9195
02:29:41,439 --> 02:29:43,349
to to say scientifically like all the
rich complexity of the world emerges

9196
02:29:43,349 --> 02:29:43,359
rich complexity of the world emerges
 

9197
02:29:43,359 --> 02:29:44,710
rich complexity of the world emerges
from just some biology and some

9198
02:29:44,710 --> 02:29:44,720
from just some biology and some
 

9199
02:29:44,720 --> 02:29:45,830
from just some biology and some
chemicals

9200
02:29:45,830 --> 02:29:45,840
chemicals
 

9201
02:29:45,840 --> 02:29:47,270
chemicals
so in that you know in that that

9202
02:29:47,270 --> 02:29:47,280
so in that you know in that that
 

9203
02:29:47,280 --> 02:29:49,030
so in that you know in that that
definition implied a causation it comes

9204
02:29:49,030 --> 02:29:49,040
definition implied a causation it comes
 

9205
02:29:49,040 --> 02:29:50,230
definition implied a causation it comes
from and so that's

9206
02:29:50,230 --> 02:29:50,240
from and so that's
 

9207
02:29:50,240 --> 02:29:51,990
from and so that's
right that's we know at least there's a

9208
02:29:51,990 --> 02:29:52,000
right that's we know at least there's a
 

9209
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:53,750
right that's we know at least there's a
solid correlation there

9210
02:29:53,750 --> 02:29:53,760
solid correlation there
 

9211
02:29:53,760 --> 02:29:56,070
solid correlation there
and so then we don't dig we delve deep

9212
02:29:56,070 --> 02:29:56,080
and so then we don't dig we delve deep
 

9213
02:29:56,080 --> 02:29:57,670
and so then we don't dig we delve deep
into the philosophy of like

9214
02:29:57,670 --> 02:29:57,680
into the philosophy of like
 

9215
02:29:57,680 --> 02:30:00,070
into the philosophy of like
idealism or materialism and things like

9216
02:30:00,070 --> 02:30:00,080
idealism or materialism and things like
 

9217
02:30:00,080 --> 02:30:01,590
idealism or materialism and things like
this which i'm not an expert in but i

9218
02:30:01,590 --> 02:30:01,600
this which i'm not an expert in but i
 

9219
02:30:01,600 --> 02:30:03,270
this which i'm not an expert in but i
know we're getting into that

9220
02:30:03,270 --> 02:30:03,280
know we're getting into that
 

9221
02:30:03,280 --> 02:30:04,870
know we're getting into that
territory you don't even necessarily

9222
02:30:04,870 --> 02:30:04,880
territory you don't even necessarily
 

9223
02:30:04,880 --> 02:30:06,469
territory you don't even necessarily
have to go

9224
02:30:06,469 --> 02:30:06,479
have to go
 

9225
02:30:06,479 --> 02:30:08,150
have to go
there like you you at least go to the

9226
02:30:08,150 --> 02:30:08,160
there like you you at least go to the
 

9227
02:30:08,160 --> 02:30:10,150
there like you you at least go to the
level of like okay we know there's there

9228
02:30:10,150 --> 02:30:10,160
level of like okay we know there's there
 

9229
02:30:10,160 --> 02:30:11,190
level of like okay we know there's there
seems to be this one-on-one

9230
02:30:11,190 --> 02:30:11,200
seems to be this one-on-one
 

9231
02:30:11,200 --> 02:30:12,230
seems to be this one-on-one
correspondence

9232
02:30:12,230 --> 02:30:12,240
correspondence
 

9233
02:30:12,240 --> 02:30:15,110
correspondence
and that seems pretty silent like you

9234
02:30:15,110 --> 02:30:15,120
and that seems pretty silent like you
 

9235
02:30:15,120 --> 02:30:16,550
and that seems pretty silent like you
can't prove a negative and you can't

9236
02:30:16,550 --> 02:30:16,560
can't prove a negative and you can't
 

9237
02:30:16,560 --> 02:30:18,070
can't prove a negative and you can't
you know it's like in that category of

9238
02:30:18,070 --> 02:30:18,080
you know it's like in that category of
 

9239
02:30:18,080 --> 02:30:19,990
you know it's like in that category of
like yeah me you could come up with an

9240
02:30:19,990 --> 02:30:20,000
like yeah me you could come up with an
 

9241
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:21,190
like yeah me you could come up with an
experience that maybe doesn't have a

9242
02:30:21,190 --> 02:30:21,200
experience that maybe doesn't have a
 

9243
02:30:21,200 --> 02:30:23,429
experience that maybe doesn't have a
biological correlate but

9244
02:30:23,429 --> 02:30:23,439
biological correlate but
 

9245
02:30:23,439 --> 02:30:24,710
biological correlate but
then you're talking about there's also

9246
02:30:24,710 --> 02:30:24,720
then you're talking about there's also
 

9247
02:30:24,720 --> 02:30:26,070
then you're talking about there's also
the limits of the science so is it a

9248
02:30:26,070 --> 02:30:26,080
the limits of the science so is it a
 

9249
02:30:26,080 --> 02:30:27,270
the limits of the science so is it a
false negative but

9250
02:30:27,270 --> 02:30:27,280
false negative but
 

9251
02:30:27,280 --> 02:30:29,030
false negative but
i think our best guess and a very decent

9252
02:30:29,030 --> 02:30:29,040
i think our best guess and a very decent
 

9253
02:30:29,040 --> 02:30:30,389
i think our best guess and a very decent
assumption is that

9254
02:30:30,389 --> 02:30:30,399
assumption is that
 

9255
02:30:30,399 --> 02:30:32,070
assumption is that
every psychological event has a

9256
02:30:32,070 --> 02:30:32,080
every psychological event has a
 

9257
02:30:32,080 --> 02:30:33,590
every psychological event has a
biological correlate

9258
02:30:33,590 --> 02:30:33,600
biological correlate
 

9259
02:30:33,600 --> 02:30:36,950
biological correlate
so with that said you know the idea that

9260
02:30:36,950 --> 02:30:36,960
so with that said you know the idea that
 

9261
02:30:36,960 --> 02:30:40,389
so with that said you know the idea that
you can throw alter that biology

9262
02:30:40,389 --> 02:30:40,399
you can throw alter that biology
 

9263
02:30:40,399 --> 02:30:42,550
you can throw alter that biology
in a pretty trivial manner i mean you

9264
02:30:42,550 --> 02:30:42,560
in a pretty trivial manner i mean you
 

9265
02:30:42,560 --> 02:30:43,830
in a pretty trivial manner i mean you
could take like

9266
02:30:43,830 --> 02:30:43,840
could take like
 

9267
02:30:43,840 --> 02:30:45,510
could take like
a relatively small number of these

9268
02:30:45,510 --> 02:30:45,520
a relatively small number of these
 

9269
02:30:45,520 --> 02:30:47,429
a relatively small number of these
molecules throw them into the nervous

9270
02:30:47,429 --> 02:30:47,439
molecules throw them into the nervous
 

9271
02:30:47,439 --> 02:30:48,710
molecules throw them into the nervous
system

9272
02:30:48,710 --> 02:30:48,720
system
 

9273
02:30:48,720 --> 02:30:52,230
system
and then have a a 60 year old person

9274
02:30:52,230 --> 02:30:52,240
and then have a a 60 year old person
 

9275
02:30:52,240 --> 02:30:56,070
and then have a a 60 year old person
who has you name it i mean that has

9276
02:30:56,070 --> 02:30:56,080
who has you name it i mean that has
 

9277
02:30:56,080 --> 02:30:59,349
who has you name it i mean that has
hiked to the top of everest and that

9278
02:30:59,349 --> 02:30:59,359
hiked to the top of everest and that
 

9279
02:30:59,359 --> 02:31:01,270
hiked to the top of everest and that
speaks five languages

9280
02:31:01,270 --> 02:31:01,280
speaks five languages
 

9281
02:31:01,280 --> 02:31:03,510
speaks five languages
and that has been married and has kids

9282
02:31:03,510 --> 02:31:03,520
and that has been married and has kids
 

9283
02:31:03,520 --> 02:31:04,790
and that has been married and has kids
and grandkids

9284
02:31:04,790 --> 02:31:04,800
and grandkids
 

9285
02:31:04,800 --> 02:31:07,670
and grandkids
and has you name you know like been at

9286
02:31:07,670 --> 02:31:07,680
and has you name you know like been at
 

9287
02:31:07,680 --> 02:31:08,870
and has you name you know like been at
the top and say

9288
02:31:08,870 --> 02:31:08,880
the top and say
 

9289
02:31:08,880 --> 02:31:11,990
the top and say
this fundamentally changed who i am as a

9290
02:31:11,990 --> 02:31:12,000
this fundamentally changed who i am as a
 

9291
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:12,630
this fundamentally changed who i am as a
person

9292
02:31:12,630 --> 02:31:12,640
person
 

9293
02:31:12,640 --> 02:31:15,349
person
and and the and what i think life is

9294
02:31:15,349 --> 02:31:15,359
and and the and what i think life is
 

9295
02:31:15,359 --> 02:31:16,950
and and the and what i think life is
about

9296
02:31:16,950 --> 02:31:16,960
about
 

9297
02:31:16,960 --> 02:31:19,990
about
like that's that's the thing about

9298
02:31:19,990 --> 02:31:20,000
like that's that's the thing about
 

9299
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:23,270
like that's that's the thing about
psychedelics that just floors me and it

9300
02:31:23,270 --> 02:31:23,280
psychedelics that just floors me and it
 

9301
02:31:23,280 --> 02:31:26,309
psychedelics that just floors me and it
it never fails i mean sometimes you get

9302
02:31:26,309 --> 02:31:26,319
it never fails i mean sometimes you get
 

9303
02:31:26,319 --> 02:31:28,389
it never fails i mean sometimes you get
bogged down by the paperwork and running

9304
02:31:28,389 --> 02:31:28,399
bogged down by the paperwork and running
 

9305
02:31:28,399 --> 02:31:29,590
bogged down by the paperwork and running
studies and all the

9306
02:31:29,590 --> 02:31:29,600
studies and all the
 

9307
02:31:29,600 --> 02:31:31,830
studies and all the
i don't know all of the the bs that can

9308
02:31:31,830 --> 02:31:31,840
i don't know all of the the bs that can
 

9309
02:31:31,840 --> 02:31:33,270
i don't know all of the the bs that can
come with being in academia and

9310
02:31:33,270 --> 02:31:33,280
come with being in academia and
 

9311
02:31:33,280 --> 02:31:35,510
come with being in academia and
everything and then you

9312
02:31:35,510 --> 02:31:35,520
everything and then you
 

9313
02:31:35,520 --> 02:31:37,110
everything and then you
and sometimes you get some dud sessions

9314
02:31:37,110 --> 02:31:37,120
and sometimes you get some dud sessions
 

9315
02:31:37,120 --> 02:31:38,550
and sometimes you get some dud sessions
where it's not the fullness all the

9316
02:31:38,550 --> 02:31:38,560
where it's not the fullness all the
 

9317
02:31:38,560 --> 02:31:40,469
where it's not the fullness all the
magic isn't happening and it's you know

9318
02:31:40,469 --> 02:31:40,479
magic isn't happening and it's you know
 

9319
02:31:40,479 --> 02:31:41,270
magic isn't happening and it's you know
more or less it's

9320
02:31:41,270 --> 02:31:41,280
more or less it's
 

9321
02:31:41,280 --> 02:31:43,510
more or less it's
or it's either a dud or somewhere in the

9322
02:31:43,510 --> 02:31:43,520
or it's either a dud or somewhere in the
 

9323
02:31:43,520 --> 02:31:44,950
or it's either a dud or somewhere in the
i don't mean to dismiss them but you

9324
02:31:44,950 --> 02:31:44,960
i don't mean to dismiss them but you
 

9325
02:31:44,960 --> 02:31:46,150
i don't mean to dismiss them but you
know it's it's not like these

9326
02:31:46,150 --> 02:31:46,160
know it's it's not like these
 

9327
02:31:46,160 --> 02:31:47,670
know it's it's not like these
magnificent sort of reports but

9328
02:31:47,670 --> 02:31:47,680
magnificent sort of reports but
 

9329
02:31:47,680 --> 02:31:49,910
magnificent sort of reports but
sometimes you get the full monty

9330
02:31:49,910 --> 02:31:49,920
sometimes you get the full monty
 

9331
02:31:49,920 --> 02:31:51,830
sometimes you get the full monty
report from one of these people and

9332
02:31:51,830 --> 02:31:51,840
report from one of these people and
 

9333
02:31:51,840 --> 02:31:53,750
report from one of these people and
you're like oh yeah that's why we're

9334
02:31:53,750 --> 02:31:53,760
you're like oh yeah that's why we're
 

9335
02:31:53,760 --> 02:31:55,429
you're like oh yeah that's why we're
doing this whether it's like

9336
02:31:55,429 --> 02:31:55,439
doing this whether it's like
 

9337
02:31:55,439 --> 02:31:58,870
doing this whether it's like
therapeutically or just to understand

9338
02:31:58,870 --> 02:31:58,880
therapeutically or just to understand
 

9339
02:31:58,880 --> 02:32:02,630
therapeutically or just to understand
the mind and you're like

9340
02:32:02,630 --> 02:32:02,640
the mind and you're like
 

9341
02:32:02,640 --> 02:32:04,389
the mind and you're like
you're still floored like how is that

9342
02:32:04,389 --> 02:32:04,399
you're still floored like how is that
 

9343
02:32:04,399 --> 02:32:07,110
you're still floored like how is that
possible how did we

9344
02:32:07,110 --> 02:32:07,120
possible how did we
 

9345
02:32:07,120 --> 02:32:09,030
possible how did we
slightly alter serotonergic

9346
02:32:09,030 --> 02:32:09,040
slightly alter serotonergic
 

9347

so much it's like man

9370
02:32:35,030 --> 02:32:35,040
so much it's like man

what if this could be up i mean like ha

9372
02:32:38,070 --> 02:32:38,080
what if this could be up i mean like ha
 

9373
02:32:38,080 --> 02:32:40,309
what if this could be up i mean like ha
because we're just like took a little

9374
02:32:40,309 --> 02:32:40,319
because we're just like took a little
 

9375
02:32:40,319 --> 02:32:41,910
because we're just like took a little
like it's like lighting a match or

9376
02:32:41,910 --> 02:32:41,920
like it's like lighting a match or
 

9377
02:32:41,920 --> 02:32:43,429
like it's like lighting a match or
something in the darkness and you can

9378
02:32:43,429 --> 02:32:43,439
something in the darkness and you can
 

9379
02:32:43,439 --> 02:32:45,110
something in the darkness and you can
see there's a lot more there but you

9380
02:32:45,110 --> 02:32:45,120
see there's a lot more there but you
 

9381
02:32:45,120 --> 02:32:45,670
see there's a lot more there but you
don't know

9382
02:32:45,670 --> 02:32:45,680
don't know
 

9383
02:32:45,680 --> 02:32:48,870
don't know
how much more and that's right

9384
02:32:48,870 --> 02:32:48,880
how much more and that's right
 

9385
02:32:48,880 --> 02:32:50,630
how much more and that's right
and then like where's that gonna go with

9386
02:32:50,630 --> 02:32:50,640
and then like where's that gonna go with
 

9387
02:32:50,640 --> 02:32:53,190
and then like where's that gonna go with
like i mean i'm always like aware of the

9388
02:32:53,190 --> 02:32:53,200
like i mean i'm always like aware of the
 

9389
02:32:53,200 --> 02:32:55,030
like i mean i'm always like aware of the
fact that like we always as humans and

9390
02:32:55,030 --> 02:32:55,040
fact that like we always as humans and
 

9391
02:32:55,040 --> 02:32:57,030
fact that like we always as humans and
as scientists think that we figured out

9392
02:32:57,030 --> 02:32:57,040
as scientists think that we figured out
 

9393
02:32:57,040 --> 02:32:59,190
as scientists think that we figured out
99 and we're working on that first one

9394
02:32:59,190 --> 02:32:59,200
99 and we're working on that first one
 

9395
02:32:59,200 --> 02:33:00,710
99 and we're working on that first one
and we got to keep reminding ourselves

9396
02:33:00,710 --> 02:33:00,720
and we got to keep reminding ourselves
 

9397
02:33:00,720 --> 02:33:01,750
and we got to keep reminding ourselves
it's hard to do like

9398
02:33:01,750 --> 02:33:01,760
it's hard to do like
 

9399
02:33:01,760 --> 02:33:03,750
it's hard to do like
we figured out like not even one percent

9400
02:33:03,750 --> 02:33:03,760
we figured out like not even one percent
 

9401
02:33:03,760 --> 02:33:05,110
we figured out like not even one percent
like we know nothing

9402
02:33:05,110 --> 02:33:05,120
like we know nothing
 

9403
02:33:05,120 --> 02:33:08,309
like we know nothing
yeah and so like i can't i can speculate

9404
02:33:08,309 --> 02:33:08,319
yeah and so like i can't i can speculate
 

9405
02:33:08,319 --> 02:33:09,830
yeah and so like i can't i can speculate
and i might sound like a fool but like

9406
02:33:09,830 --> 02:33:09,840
and i might sound like a fool but like
 

9407
02:33:09,840 --> 02:33:11,910
and i might sound like a fool but like

and
 

9497
02:34:36,720 --> 02:34:39,910
and
and like where that goes is just

9498
02:34:39,910 --> 02:34:39,920
and like where that goes is just
 

9499
02:34:39,920 --> 02:34:43,030
and like where that goes is just
it's it's unthinkable like we we're

02:34:43,030 --> 02:34:43,040
it's it's unthinkable like we we're

sound like a fool and

9504
02:34:45,750 --> 02:34:45,760
sound like a fool and
 

9505
02:34:45,760 --> 02:34:47,030
sound like a fool and
this may not happen but i think it's

9506
02:34:47,030 --> 02:34:47,040
this may not happen but i think it's
 

9507
02:34:47,040 --> 02:34:49,990
this may not happen but i think it's
possible you know to go completely

9508
02:34:49,990 --> 02:34:50,000
possible you know to go completely
 

9509
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:50,630
possible you know to go completely

like where most of people's experiences

9512
02:34:53,190 --> 02:34:53,200
like where most of people's experiences
 

9513
02:34:53,200 --> 02:34:55,349
like where most of people's experiences
may be

9514
02:34:55,349 --> 02:34:55,359
may be
 

9515
02:34:55,359 --> 02:34:58,710
may be
going into these internal worlds

9516
02:34:58,710 --> 02:34:58,720
going into these internal worlds
 

9517
02:34:58,720 --> 02:35:01,429
going into these internal worlds
and i mean maybe you through through

9518
02:35:01,429 --> 02:35:01,439
and i mean maybe you through through
 

9519
02:35:01,439 --> 02:35:02,230
and i mean maybe you through through
some

9520
02:35:02,230 --> 02:35:02,240
some
 

9521
02:35:02,240 --> 02:35:03,270
some
through a combination of these

9522
02:35:03,270 --> 02:35:03,280
through a combination of these
 

9523
02:35:03,280 --> 02:35:04,710
through a combination of these
techniques you create experiences where

9524
02:35:04,710 --> 02:35:04,720
techniques you create experiences where
 

9525
02:35:04,720 --> 02:35:07,349
techniques you create experiences where
someone could live a thousand years

9526
02:35:07,349 --> 02:35:07,359
someone could live a thousand years
 

9527
02:35:07,359 --> 02:35:08,630
someone could live a thousand years
in terms of maybe they're living a

9528
02:35:08,630 --> 02:35:08,640
in terms of maybe they're living a
 

9529
02:35:08,640 --> 02:35:10,469
in terms of maybe they're living a
regular lifespan but in over the next

9530
02:35:10,469 --> 02:35:10,479
regular lifespan but in over the next
 

9531
02:35:10,479 --> 02:35:11,830
regular lifespan but in over the next
two seconds you're living a thousand

9532
02:35:11,830 --> 02:35:11,840
two seconds you're living a thousand
 

9533
02:35:11,840 --> 02:35:13,270
two seconds you're living a thousand
years worth of experience

9534
02:35:13,270 --> 02:35:13,280
years worth of experience
 

9535
02:35:13,280 --> 02:35:15,190
years worth of experience
inside inside your mind through yeah

9536
02:35:15,190 --> 02:35:15,200
inside inside your mind through yeah
 

9537
02:35:15,200 --> 02:35:17,590
inside inside your mind through yeah
through this manipulation of the like

9538
02:35:17,590 --> 02:35:17,600
through this manipulation of the like
 

9539
02:35:17,600 --> 02:35:21,190
through this manipulation of the like
is that possible like just based on on

9540
02:35:21,190 --> 02:35:21,200
is that possible like just based on on
 

9541
02:35:21,200 --> 02:35:24,710
is that possible like just based on on
like first principles i suppose yes

9542
02:35:24,710 --> 02:35:24,720
like first principles i suppose yes
 

9543
02:35:24,720 --> 02:35:27,910
like first principles i suppose yes
i think so yeah like give us another 50

9544
02:35:27,910 --> 02:35:27,920
i think so yeah like give us another 50
 

9545
02:35:27,920 --> 02:35:30,790
i think so yeah like give us another 50
hundred 500 like who knows but like how

9546
02:35:30,790 --> 02:35:30,800
hundred 500 like who knows but like how
 

9547
02:35:30,800 --> 02:35:31,670
hundred 500 like who knows but like how
could it not

9548
02:35:31,670 --> 02:35:31,680
could it not
 

9549
02:35:31,680 --> 02:35:34,950
could it not
go there and a small tangent what are

9550
02:35:34,950 --> 02:35:34,960
go there and a small tangent what are
 

9551
02:35:34,960 --> 02:35:35,349
go there and a small tangent what are
your

9552
02:35:35,349 --> 02:35:35,359

02:35:42,469 --> 02:35:42,479
mind altering things what are your
 

9559
02:35:42,479 --> 02:35:44,790
mind altering things what are your
thoughts about neural link and

9560
02:35:44,790 --> 02:35:44,800
thoughts about neural link and
 

9561
02:35:44,800 --> 02:35:48,550
thoughts about neural link and
brain computer interfaces sort of

9562
02:35:48,550 --> 02:35:48,560
brain computer interfaces sort of
 

9563
02:35:48,560 --> 02:35:52,870
brain computer interfaces sort of
being able to electrically stimulate

9564
02:35:52,870 --> 02:35:52,880
being able to electrically stimulate
 

9565
02:35:52,880 --> 02:35:56,870
being able to electrically stimulate
and read and neuronal activity

9566
02:35:56,870 --> 02:35:56,880
and read and neuronal activity
 

9567
02:35:56,880 --> 02:35:58,550
and read and neuronal activity
in the brain and then connect that to

9568
02:35:58,550 --> 02:35:58,560
in the brain and then connect that to
 

9569
02:35:58,560 --> 02:36:00,550
in the brain and then connect that to
the the computer which

9570
02:36:00,550 --> 02:36:00,560
the the computer which
 

9571
02:36:00,560 --> 02:36:04,389
the the computer which
is another way uh from a computational

9572
02:36:04,389 --> 02:36:04,399
is another way uh from a computational
 

9573
02:36:04,399 --> 02:36:06,469
is another way uh from a computational
perspective for me is kind of appealing

9574
02:36:06,469 --> 02:36:06,479
perspective for me is kind of appealing
 

9575
02:36:06,479 --> 02:36:10,150
perspective for me is kind of appealing
but it's another way of

9576
02:36:10,150 --> 02:36:10,160
but it's another way of
 

9577
02:36:10,160 --> 02:36:12,870
but it's another way of
altering subtly the behavior of the

9578
02:36:12,870 --> 02:36:12,880
altering subtly the behavior of the
 

9579
02:36:12,880 --> 02:36:13,670
altering subtly the behavior of the
brain

9580
02:36:13,670 --> 02:36:13,680
brain
 

9581
02:36:13,680 --> 02:36:16,309
brain
that's kind of if you zoom out

9582
02:36:16,309 --> 02:36:16,319
that's kind of if you zoom out
 

9583
02:36:16,319 --> 02:36:17,190
that's kind of if you zoom out
reminiscent

9584
02:36:17,190 --> 02:36:17,200
reminiscent
 

9585
02:36:17,200 --> 02:36:20,230
reminiscent
of the way psychedelics do as well right

9586
02:36:20,230 --> 02:36:20,240
of the way psychedelics do as well right
 

9587
02:36:20,240 --> 02:36:22,870
of the way psychedelics do as well right
so what do you have like what are your

9588
02:36:22,870 --> 02:36:22,880
so what do you have like what are your
 

9589
02:36:22,880 --> 02:36:23,670
so what do you have like what are your
thoughts about

thoughts about
 

9591
02:36:23,680 --> 02:36:26,389
thoughts about
neurolink what are your hopes as a

02:36:26,389 --> 02:36:26,399
neurolink what are your hopes as a
 

9593
02:36:26,399 --> 02:36:27,590
neurolink what are your hopes as a
researcher of

9594
02:36:27,590 --> 02:36:27,600
researcher of

you know you're going into a brave new

9608
02:36:42,150 --> 02:36:42,160
you know you're going into a brave new
 

9609
02:36:42,160 --> 02:36:44,150
you know you're going into a brave new
world where it's like all of a sudden

9610
02:36:44,150 --> 02:36:44,160
world where it's like all of a sudden
 

9611
02:36:44,160 --> 02:36:46,309
world where it's like all of a sudden
there's going to be a dark side there's

02:36:46,309 --> 02:36:46,319
there's going to be a dark side there's
 

9613
02:36:46,319 --> 02:36:48,150
there's going to be a dark side there's
going to be you know that

9614
02:36:48,150 --> 02:36:48,160
going to be you know that
 

9615
02:36:48,160 --> 02:36:51,349
going to be you know that
serious ethical considerations but

9616
02:36:51,349 --> 02:36:51,359
serious ethical considerations but
 

9617
02:36:51,359 --> 02:36:53,990
serious ethical considerations but
that that should not stop us from from

9618
02:36:53,990 --> 02:36:54,000
that that should not stop us from from
 

9619
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:55,510
that that should not stop us from from
moving there i mean particularly the

9620
02:36:55,510 --> 02:36:55,520
moving there i mean particularly the
 

9621
02:36:55,520 --> 02:36:57,750
moving there i mean particularly the
stuff from an unknown expert but

9622
02:36:57,750 --> 02:36:57,760
stuff from an unknown expert but
 

9623
02:36:57,760 --> 02:36:59,750
stuff from an unknown expert but
on the short list in the short term it's

9624
02:36:59,750 --> 02:36:59,760
on the short list in the short term it's
 

9625
02:36:59,760 --> 02:37:01,190
on the short list in the short term it's
like yeah can we help these serious

9626
02:37:01,190 --> 02:37:01,200
like yeah can we help these serious
 

9627
02:37:01,200 --> 02:37:03,670
like yeah can we help these serious
neurological disorders like hell yeah

9628
02:37:03,670 --> 02:37:03,680
neurological disorders like hell yeah
 

9629
02:37:03,680 --> 02:37:05,990
neurological disorders like hell yeah
like and and i'm also sensitive to

9630
02:37:05,990 --> 02:37:06,000
like and and i'm also sensitive to
 

9631
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:08,550
like and and i'm also sensitive to
something being someone that has lots of

02:37:08,550 --> 02:37:08,560
something being someone that has lots of
 

9633
02:37:08,560 --> 02:37:12,710
something being someone that has lots of
you know neuroscience colleagues um

9634
02:37:12,710 --> 02:37:12,720
you know neuroscience colleagues um
 

9635
02:37:12,720 --> 02:37:14,469
you know neuroscience colleagues um
you know with some of the stuff and i

9636
02:37:14,469 --> 02:37:14,479
you know with some of the stuff and i
 

9637
02:37:14,479 --> 02:37:16,150
you know with some of the stuff and i
can't talk about particulars i'm not

9638
02:37:16,150 --> 02:37:16,160
can't talk about particulars i'm not
 

9639
02:37:16,160 --> 02:37:18,230
can't talk about particulars i'm not
recalling but you know in terms of

9640
02:37:18,230 --> 02:37:18,240
recalling but you know in terms of
 

9641
02:37:18,240 --> 02:37:20,630
recalling but you know in terms of
you know stuff getting out there and

9642
02:37:20,630 --> 02:37:20,640
you know stuff getting out there and
 

9643
02:37:20,640 --> 02:37:22,710
you know stuff getting out there and
then kind of a mocking of

9644
02:37:22,710 --> 02:37:22,720
then kind of a mocking of
 

9645
02:37:22,720 --> 02:37:25,830
then kind of a mocking of
of of uh you know gosh they're they're

9646
02:37:25,830 --> 02:37:25,840
of of uh you know gosh they're they're
 

9647
02:37:25,840 --> 02:37:27,030
of of uh you know gosh they're they're
saying this is unique we

9648
02:37:27,030 --> 02:37:27,040
saying this is unique we
 

9649
02:37:27,040 --> 02:37:28,469
saying this is unique we
we know this or sort of like this

9650
02:37:28,469 --> 02:37:28,479
we know this or sort of like this
 

9651
02:37:28,479 --> 02:37:30,710
we know this or sort of like this
belittling of like oh

9652
02:37:30,710 --> 02:37:30,720
belittling of like oh
 

9653
02:37:30,720 --> 02:37:32,550
belittling of like oh
you know this sounds like it's just a i

9654
02:37:32,550 --> 02:37:32,560
you know this sounds like it's just a i
 

9655
02:37:32,560 --> 02:37:35,110
you know this sounds like it's just a i
don't know a commercialization or like

9656
02:37:35,110 --> 02:37:35,120
don't know a commercialization or like
 

9657
02:37:35,120 --> 02:37:36,710
don't know a commercialization or like
an oversimply i forget what the example

9658
02:37:36,710 --> 02:37:36,720
an oversimply i forget what the example
 

9659
02:37:36,720 --> 02:37:38,550
an oversimply i forget what the example
was but something like

9660
02:37:38,550 --> 02:37:38,560
was but something like
 

9661
02:37:38,560 --> 02:37:40,150
was but something like
something that came off to some of my

9662
02:37:40,150 --> 02:37:40,160
something that came off to some of my
 

9663

02:37:41,680 --> 02:37:43,270
neuroscientific colleagues as an
oversimplification or at least the way

9666
02:37:43,270 --> 02:37:43,280
oversimplification or at least the way
 

9667
02:37:43,280 --> 02:37:44,389
oversimplification or at least the way
they said it

9668
02:37:44,389 --> 02:37:44,399
they said it
 

9669
02:37:44,399 --> 02:37:46,790
they said it
oh from a kneeling perspective right oh

9670
02:37:46,790 --> 02:37:46,800
oh from a kneeling perspective right oh
 

9671
02:37:46,800 --> 02:37:48,309
oh from a kneeling perspective right oh
we've known that for years

9672
02:37:48,309 --> 02:37:48,319
we've known that for years
 

9673
02:37:48,319 --> 02:37:51,429
we've known that for years
yes and like but i'm very sympathetic to

9674
02:37:51,429 --> 02:37:51,439
yes and like but i'm very sympathetic to
 

9675
02:37:51,439 --> 02:37:51,990
yes and like but i'm very sympathetic to
like

9676
02:37:51,990 --> 02:37:52,000
like
 

9677
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:53,990
like
maybe it's because of my very limited

9678
02:37:53,990 --> 02:37:54,000
maybe it's because of my very limited
 

9679
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:56,710
maybe it's because of my very limited
but relatively speaking

9680
02:37:56,710 --> 02:37:56,720
but relatively speaking
 

9681
02:37:56,720 --> 02:37:58,710
but relatively speaking
the amount of exposure the psychedelic

9682
02:37:58,710 --> 02:37:58,720
the amount of exposure the psychedelic
 

9683
02:37:58,720 --> 02:37:59,990
the amount of exposure the psychedelic
work has had so my limited

9684
02:37:59,990 --> 02:38:00,000
work has had so my limited
 

9685
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:01,830
work has had so my limited
experience of being out there and then

9686
02:38:01,830 --> 02:38:01,840
experience of being out there and then
 

9687
02:38:01,840 --> 02:38:03,110
experience of being out there and then
you think about someone like

9688
02:38:03,110 --> 02:38:03,120
you think about someone like
 

9689
02:38:03,120 --> 02:38:05,830
you think about someone like
mike musk who's like like really really

9690
02:38:05,830 --> 02:38:05,840
mike musk who's like like really really
 

9691
02:38:05,840 --> 02:38:07,670
mike musk who's like like really really
out there and you just get

9692
02:38:07,670 --> 02:38:07,680
out there and you just get
 

9693
02:38:07,680 --> 02:38:10,630
out there and you just get
all these arrows that like and it's hard

9694
02:38:10,630 --> 02:38:10,640
all these arrows that like and it's hard
 

9695
02:38:10,640 --> 02:38:12,230
all these arrows that like and it's hard
to be like when you're plowing new

9696
02:38:12,230 --> 02:38:12,240
to be like when you're plowing new
 

9697
02:38:12,240 --> 02:38:13,750
to be like when you're plowing new
ground

9698
02:38:13,750 --> 02:38:13,760
ground
 

9699
02:38:13,760 --> 02:38:15,670
ground
like you're gonna get you're gonna

9700
02:38:15,670 --> 02:38:15,680
like you're gonna get you're gonna
 

9701
02:38:15,680 --> 02:38:17,429
like you're gonna get you're gonna
criticize like every little word that

9702
02:38:17,429 --> 02:38:17,439
criticize like every little word that
 

9703
02:38:17,439 --> 02:38:17,910
criticize like every little word that
you like

9704
02:38:17,910 --> 02:38:17,920
you like
 

9705
02:38:17,920 --> 02:38:19,670
you like
this balance between speaking to like

9706
02:38:19,670 --> 02:38:19,680
this balance between speaking to like
 

9707
02:38:19,680 --> 02:38:20,950
this balance between speaking to like
people to make it meaningful something

9708
02:38:20,950 --> 02:38:20,960
people to make it meaningful something
 

9709
02:38:20,960 --> 02:38:22,309
people to make it meaningful something
scientists aren't very good at

9710
02:38:22,309 --> 02:38:22,319
scientists aren't very good at
 

9711
02:38:22,319 --> 02:38:23,990
scientists aren't very good at
yes having people understand what you're

9712
02:38:23,990 --> 02:38:24,000
yes having people understand what you're
 

9713
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:25,990
yes having people understand what you're
saying and then being belittled by

9714
02:38:25,990 --> 02:38:26,000
saying and then being belittled by
 

9715
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:27,429
saying and then being belittled by
oversimplifying something

9716
02:38:27,429 --> 02:38:27,439
oversimplifying something
 

9717
02:38:27,439 --> 02:38:30,309
oversimplifying something
in in terms of the public message so i'm

9718
02:38:30,309 --> 02:38:30,319
in in terms of the public message so i'm
 

9719
02:38:30,319 --> 02:38:31,990
in in terms of the public message so i'm
extremely sympathetic

9720
02:38:31,990 --> 02:38:32,000
extremely sympathetic
 

9721
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:34,070
extremely sympathetic
and i'm a big fan of like what that you

9722
02:38:34,070 --> 02:38:34,080
and i'm a big fan of like what that you
 

9723
02:38:34,080 --> 02:38:35,429
and i'm a big fan of like what that you
know what elon musk does

9724
02:38:35,429 --> 02:38:35,439
know what elon musk does
 

9725
02:38:35,439 --> 02:38:38,150
know what elon musk does
like tunnels through the ground and

9726
02:38:38,150 --> 02:38:38,160
like tunnels through the ground and
 

9727
02:38:38,160 --> 02:38:39,830
like tunnels through the ground and
spacex and all this is like

9728
02:38:39,830 --> 02:38:39,840
spacex and all this is like
 

9729
02:38:39,840 --> 02:38:42,389
spacex and all this is like
hell yeah like this guy is has some he

9730
02:38:42,389 --> 02:38:42,399
hell yeah like this guy is has some he
 

9731
02:38:42,399 --> 02:38:43,670
hell yeah like this guy is has some he
has some great ideas

9732
02:38:43,670 --> 02:38:43,680
has some great ideas
 

9733
02:38:43,680 --> 02:38:45,190
has some great ideas
and there's something to be said it's

9734
02:38:45,190 --> 02:38:45,200
and there's something to be said it's
 

9735
02:38:45,200 --> 02:38:46,790
and there's something to be said it's
not just the the communication to the

9736
02:38:46,790 --> 02:38:46,800
not just the the communication to the
 

9737
02:38:46,800 --> 02:38:47,270
not just the the communication to the
public

9738
02:38:47,270 --> 02:38:47,280
public
 

9739
02:38:47,280 --> 02:38:50,070
public
i i think his first principles thinking

9740
02:38:50,070 --> 02:38:50,080
i i think his first principles thinking
 

9741
02:38:50,080 --> 02:38:50,630
i i think his first principles thinking
it's like

9742
02:38:50,630 --> 02:38:50,640
it's like
 

9743
02:38:50,640 --> 02:38:52,070
it's like
because i get this in the artificial

9744
02:38:52,070 --> 02:38:52,080
because i get this in the artificial
 

9745
02:38:52,080 --> 02:38:53,590
because i get this in the artificial
intelligence world it's probably similar

9746
02:38:53,590 --> 02:38:53,600
intelligence world it's probably similar
 

9747
02:38:53,600 --> 02:38:55,110
intelligence world it's probably similar
to neuroscience world

9748
02:38:55,110 --> 02:38:55,120
to neuroscience world
 

9749
02:38:55,120 --> 02:38:57,590
to neuroscience world
where elon will say something like or i

9750
02:38:57,590 --> 02:38:57,600
where elon will say something like or i
 

9751
02:38:57,600 --> 02:38:58,389
where elon will say something like or i
worked at

9752
02:38:58,389 --> 02:38:58,399
worked at
 

9753
02:38:58,399 --> 02:39:00,790
worked at
mit i worked on autonomous vehicles and

9754
02:39:00,790 --> 02:39:00,800
mit i worked on autonomous vehicles and
 

9755
02:39:00,800 --> 02:39:02,389
mit i worked on autonomous vehicles and
he's sort of

9756
02:39:02,389 --> 02:39:02,399
he's sort of
 

9757
02:39:02,399 --> 02:39:05,030
he's sort of
i could sense how much he pisses off

9758
02:39:05,030 --> 02:39:05,040
i could sense how much he pisses off
 

9759
02:39:05,040 --> 02:39:06,630
i could sense how much he pisses off
like every roboticist

9760
02:39:06,630 --> 02:39:06,640
like every roboticist
 

9761
02:39:06,640 --> 02:39:09,750
like every roboticist
at mit and everybody who works on like

9762
02:39:09,750 --> 02:39:09,760
at mit and everybody who works on like
 

9763
02:39:09,760 --> 02:39:10,710
at mit and everybody who works on like
the human factor

9764
02:39:10,710 --> 02:39:10,720
the human factor
 

9765
02:39:10,720 --> 02:39:13,510
the human factor
side of safety of autonomous vehicles

9766
02:39:13,510 --> 02:39:13,520
side of safety of autonomous vehicles
 

9767
02:39:13,520 --> 02:39:14,870
side of safety of autonomous vehicles
and saying like

9768
02:39:14,870 --> 02:39:14,880
and saying like
 

9769
02:39:14,880 --> 02:39:16,630
and saying like
we need we don't need to consider human

9770
02:39:16,630 --> 02:39:16,640
we need we don't need to consider human
 

9771
02:39:16,640 --> 02:39:17,990
we need we don't need to consider human
beings in the car

9772
02:39:17,990 --> 02:39:18,000
beings in the car
 

9773
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:20,389
beings in the car
like the ill car will drive itself it's

9774
02:39:20,389 --> 02:39:20,399
like the ill car will drive itself it's
 

9775
02:39:20,399 --> 02:39:21,110
like the ill car will drive itself it's
obvious

9776
02:39:21,110 --> 02:39:21,120
obvious
 

9777
02:39:21,120 --> 02:39:22,710
obvious
that neural networks is all you need

9778
02:39:22,710 --> 02:39:22,720
that neural networks is all you need
 

9779
02:39:22,720 --> 02:39:24,469
that neural networks is all you need
like it's obvious that

9780
02:39:24,469 --> 02:39:24,479
like it's obvious that
 

9781
02:39:24,479 --> 02:39:27,830
like it's obvious that
like we should be able to uh systems

9782
02:39:27,830 --> 02:39:27,840
like we should be able to uh systems
 

9783
02:39:27,840 --> 02:39:30,150
like we should be able to uh systems
that should be able to learn constantly

9784
02:39:30,150 --> 02:39:30,160
that should be able to learn constantly
 

9785
02:39:30,160 --> 02:39:32,150
that should be able to learn constantly
and they don't really need lidar they

9786
02:39:32,150 --> 02:39:32,160
and they don't really need lidar they
 

9787
02:39:32,160 --> 02:39:33,190
and they don't really need lidar they
just need

9788
02:39:33,190 --> 02:39:33,200
just need
 

9789
02:39:33,200 --> 02:39:35,830
just need
uh cameras because we humans just use

9790
02:39:35,830 --> 02:39:35,840
uh cameras because we humans just use
 

9791
02:39:35,840 --> 02:39:38,070
uh cameras because we humans just use
our eyes and that's the same as cameras

9792
02:39:38,070 --> 02:39:38,080
our eyes and that's the same as cameras
 

9793
02:39:38,080 --> 02:39:39,910
our eyes and that's the same as cameras
so like it doesn't why would we need

9794
02:39:39,910 --> 02:39:39,920
so like it doesn't why would we need
 

9795
02:39:39,920 --> 02:39:41,590
so like it doesn't why would we need
anything else you just have to make a

9796
02:39:41,590 --> 02:39:41,600
anything else you just have to make a
 

9797
02:39:41,600 --> 02:39:43,270
anything else you just have to make a
system that learns faster and faster and

9798
02:39:43,270 --> 02:39:43,280
system that learns faster and faster and
 

9799
02:39:43,280 --> 02:39:44,469
system that learns faster and faster and
faster

9800
02:39:44,469 --> 02:39:44,479
faster
 

9801
02:39:44,479 --> 02:39:47,030
faster
and neural networks can do that and so

9802
02:39:47,030 --> 02:39:47,040
and neural networks can do that and so
 

9803
02:39:47,040 --> 02:39:48,309
and neural networks can do that and so
that's pissing off every single

9804
02:39:48,309 --> 02:39:48,319
that's pissing off every single
 

9805
02:39:48,319 --> 02:39:50,070
that's pissing off every single
community it's pissing off human factors

9806
02:39:50,070 --> 02:39:50,080
community it's pissing off human factors
 

9807
02:39:50,080 --> 02:39:51,110
community it's pissing off human factors
communities saying

9808
02:39:51,110 --> 02:39:51,120
communities saying
 

9809
02:39:51,120 --> 02:39:52,630
communities saying
you don't need to consider the human

9810
02:39:52,630 --> 02:39:52,640
you don't need to consider the human
 

9811
02:39:52,640 --> 02:39:54,469
you don't need to consider the human
driver in the picture you can just focus

9812
02:39:54,469 --> 02:39:54,479
driver in the picture you can just focus
 

9813
02:39:54,479 --> 02:39:55,910
driver in the picture you can just focus
on the robotics problem

9814
02:39:55,910 --> 02:39:55,920
on the robotics problem
 

9815
02:39:55,920 --> 02:39:58,389
on the robotics problem
it's pissing off every robotics pers

9816
02:39:58,389 --> 02:39:58,399
it's pissing off every robotics pers
 

9817
02:39:58,399 --> 02:39:59,349
it's pissing off every robotics pers
person

9818
02:39:59,349 --> 02:39:59,359
person
 

9819
02:39:59,359 --> 02:40:01,670
person
for saying lidar can be just ignored it

9820
02:40:01,670 --> 02:40:01,680
for saying lidar can be just ignored it
 

9821
02:40:01,680 --> 02:40:02,550
for saying lidar can be just ignored it
can be camera

9822
02:40:02,550 --> 02:40:02,560
can be camera
 

9823
02:40:02,560 --> 02:40:05,429
can be camera
every robotics person knows that camera

9824
02:40:05,429 --> 02:40:05,439
every robotics person knows that camera
 

9825
02:40:05,439 --> 02:40:07,030
every robotics person knows that camera
is really noisy that's really difficult

9826
02:40:07,030 --> 02:40:07,040
is really noisy that's really difficult
 

9827
02:40:07,040 --> 02:40:08,070
is really noisy that's really difficult
to deal with

9828
02:40:08,070 --> 02:40:08,080
to deal with
 

9829
02:40:08,080 --> 02:40:11,110
to deal with
but he's uh and then uh every

9830
02:40:11,110 --> 02:40:11,120
but he's uh and then uh every
 

9831
02:40:11,120 --> 02:40:14,150
but he's uh and then uh every
ai person who says who hears neural

9832
02:40:14,150 --> 02:40:14,160
ai person who says who hears neural
 

9833
02:40:14,160 --> 02:40:14,950
ai person who says who hears neural
networks

9834
02:40:14,950 --> 02:40:14,960
networks
 

9835
02:40:14,960 --> 02:40:17,510
networks
and and says like neural networks can

9836
02:40:17,510 --> 02:40:17,520
and and says like neural networks can
 

9837
02:40:17,520 --> 02:40:18,469
and and says like neural networks can
learn everything

9838
02:40:18,469 --> 02:40:18,479
learn everything
 

9839
02:40:18,479 --> 02:40:20,150
learn everything
like almost presuming that it's kind of

9840
02:40:20,150 --> 02:40:20,160
like almost presuming that it's kind of
 

9841
02:40:20,160 --> 02:40:22,070
like almost presuming that it's kind of
going to achieve general intelligence

9842
02:40:22,070 --> 02:40:22,080
going to achieve general intelligence
 

9843
02:40:22,080 --> 02:40:25,269
going to achieve general intelligence
the problem with all those haters in the

9844
02:40:25,269 --> 02:40:25,279
the problem with all those haters in the
 

9845
02:40:25,279 --> 02:40:26,790
the problem with all those haters in the
three communities

9846
02:40:26,790 --> 02:40:26,800
three communities
 

9847
02:40:26,800 --> 02:40:29,590
three communities
is that they're looking one year ahead

9848
02:40:29,590 --> 02:40:29,600
is that they're looking one year ahead
 

9849
02:40:29,600 --> 02:40:30,950
is that they're looking one year ahead
five years ahead

9850
02:40:30,950 --> 02:40:30,960
five years ahead
 

9851
02:40:30,960 --> 02:40:33,830
five years ahead
the hilarious thing about the

9852
02:40:33,830 --> 02:40:33,840
the hilarious thing about the
 

9853
02:40:33,840 --> 02:40:35,349
the hilarious thing about the
quote-unquote ridiculous things that

9854
02:40:35,349 --> 02:40:35,359
quote-unquote ridiculous things that
 

9855
02:40:35,359 --> 02:40:36,790
quote-unquote ridiculous things that
elon musk is saying

9856
02:40:36,790 --> 02:40:36,800
elon musk is saying
 

9857
02:40:36,800 --> 02:40:38,870
elon musk is saying
is they have a pretty good shot at being

9858
02:40:38,870 --> 02:40:38,880
is they have a pretty good shot at being
 

9859
02:40:38,880 --> 02:40:40,389
is they have a pretty good shot at being
true in 20 years

9860
02:40:40,389 --> 02:40:40,399
true in 20 years
 

9861
02:40:40,399 --> 02:40:42,309
true in 20 years
and so like when you just look at the

9862
02:40:42,309 --> 02:40:42,319
and so like when you just look at the
 

9863
02:40:42,319 --> 02:40:44,070
and so like when you just look at the
you know uh

9864
02:40:44,070 --> 02:40:44,080
you know uh
 

9865
02:40:44,080 --> 02:40:45,750
you know uh
when you look at the progression of

9866
02:40:45,750 --> 02:40:45,760
when you look at the progression of
 

9867
02:40:45,760 --> 02:40:48,150
when you look at the progression of
these kinds of predictions

9868
02:40:48,150 --> 02:40:48,160
these kinds of predictions
 

9869
02:40:48,160 --> 02:40:50,150
these kinds of predictions
and sometimes first principles thinking

9870
02:40:50,150 --> 02:40:50,160
and sometimes first principles thinking
 

9871
02:40:50,160 --> 02:40:51,910
and sometimes first principles thinking
thinking can allow you to do that

9872
02:40:51,910 --> 02:40:51,920
thinking can allow you to do that
 

9873
02:40:51,920 --> 02:40:55,030
thinking can allow you to do that
is you see that it's kind of obvious

9874
02:40:55,030 --> 02:40:55,040
is you see that it's kind of obvious
 

9875
02:40:55,040 --> 02:40:57,670
is you see that it's kind of obvious
that things are going to progress this

9876
02:40:57,670 --> 02:40:57,680
that things are going to progress this
 

9877
02:40:57,680 --> 02:40:59,670
that things are going to progress this
way and if you just remove your

9878
02:40:59,670 --> 02:40:59,680
way and if you just remove your
 

9879
02:40:59,680 --> 02:41:02,790
way and if you just remove your
the prejudice you hold about the

9880
02:41:02,790 --> 02:41:02,800
the prejudice you hold about the
 

9881
02:41:02,800 --> 02:41:05,110
the prejudice you hold about the
particular battles of the current

9882
02:41:05,110 --> 02:41:05,120
particular battles of the current
 

9883
02:41:05,120 --> 02:41:07,349
particular battles of the current
academic environment

9884
02:41:07,349 --> 02:41:07,359
academic environment
 

9885
02:41:07,359 --> 02:41:08,950
academic environment
and just look at the big picture of the

9886
02:41:08,950 --> 02:41:08,960
and just look at the big picture of the
 

9887
02:41:08,960 --> 02:41:10,710
and just look at the big picture of the
progression of the technology

9888
02:41:10,710 --> 02:41:10,720
progression of the technology
 

9889
02:41:10,720 --> 02:41:14,070
progression of the technology
you can usually you can usually see the

9890
02:41:14,070 --> 02:41:14,080
you can usually you can usually see the
 

9891
02:41:14,080 --> 02:41:15,590
you can usually you can usually see the
world in the same kind of way

9892
02:41:15,590 --> 02:41:15,600
world in the same kind of way
 

9893
02:41:15,600 --> 02:41:17,429
world in the same kind of way
and so in that same way looking at

9894
02:41:17,429 --> 02:41:17,439
and so in that same way looking at
 

9895
02:41:17,439 --> 02:41:19,910
and so in that same way looking at
psychedelics you could see like

9896
02:41:19,910 --> 02:41:19,920
psychedelics you could see like
 

9897
02:41:19,920 --> 02:41:22,389
psychedelics you could see like
there is so many exciting possibilities

9898
02:41:22,389 --> 02:41:22,399
there is so many exciting possibilities
 

9899
02:41:22,399 --> 02:41:23,110
there is so many exciting possibilities
here if we

9900
02:41:23,110 --> 02:41:23,120
here if we
 

9901
02:41:23,120 --> 02:41:25,349
here if we
fully engage in the research same thing

9902
02:41:25,349 --> 02:41:25,359
fully engage in the research same thing
 

9903
02:41:25,359 --> 02:41:26,790
fully engage in the research same thing
with neurolink

9904
02:41:26,790 --> 02:41:26,800
with neurolink
 

9905
02:41:26,800 --> 02:41:29,750
with neurolink
if we fully engage so we go from a

9906
02:41:29,750 --> 02:41:29,760
if we fully engage so we go from a
 

9907
02:41:29,760 --> 02:41:31,349
if we fully engage so we go from a
thousand channels of communication to

9908
02:41:31,349 --> 02:41:31,359
thousand channels of communication to
 

9909
02:41:31,359 --> 02:41:32,309
thousand channels of communication to
the brain

9910
02:41:32,309 --> 02:41:32,319
the brain
 

9911
02:41:32,319 --> 02:41:34,389
the brain
to billions of channels of communication

9912
02:41:34,389 --> 02:41:34,399
to billions of channels of communication
 

9913
02:41:34,399 --> 02:41:35,670
to billions of channels of communication
of the brain

9914
02:41:35,670 --> 02:41:35,680
of the brain
 

9915
02:41:35,680 --> 02:41:38,550
of the brain
and we figure out many of the details of

9916
02:41:38,550 --> 02:41:38,560
and we figure out many of the details of
 

9917
02:41:38,560 --> 02:41:40,389
and we figure out many of the details of
how to do that safely with

9918
02:41:40,389 --> 02:41:40,399
how to do that safely with
 

9919
02:41:40,399 --> 02:41:42,790
how to do that safely with
neurosurgery and so on that the world

9920
02:41:42,790 --> 02:41:42,800
neurosurgery and so on that the world
 

9921
02:41:42,800 --> 02:41:44,150
neurosurgery and so on that the world
would just change

9922
02:41:44,150 --> 02:41:44,160
would just change
 

9923
02:41:44,160 --> 02:41:46,469
would just change
completely in the same kind of way that

9924
02:41:46,469 --> 02:41:46,479
completely in the same kind of way that
 

9925
02:41:46,479 --> 02:41:47,349
completely in the same kind of way that
elon is

9926
02:41:47,349 --> 02:41:47,359
elon is
 

9927
02:41:47,359 --> 02:41:49,110
elon is
it's so ridiculous to hear him talk

9928
02:41:49,110 --> 02:41:49,120
it's so ridiculous to hear him talk
 

9929
02:41:49,120 --> 02:41:51,830
it's so ridiculous to hear him talk
about uh symbiotic relationship between

9930
02:41:51,830 --> 02:41:51,840
about uh symbiotic relationship between
 

9931
02:41:51,840 --> 02:41:52,389
about uh symbiotic relationship between
ai

9932
02:41:52,389 --> 02:41:52,399
ai
 

9933
02:41:52,399 --> 02:41:56,950
ai
and uh the the human brain but it's like

9934
02:41:56,950 --> 02:41:56,960
and uh the the human brain but it's like
 

9935
02:41:56,960 --> 02:42:01,349
and uh the the human brain but it's like
is it though like it's is it

9936
02:42:01,349 --> 02:42:01,359
is it though like it's is it
 

9937
02:42:01,359 --> 02:42:03,429
is it though like it's is it
because it's i could see in 50 years

9938
02:42:03,429 --> 02:42:03,439
because it's i could see in 50 years
 

9939
02:42:03,439 --> 02:42:04,389
because it's i could see in 50 years
that's going to be an

9940
02:42:04,389 --> 02:42:04,399
that's going to be an
 

9941
02:42:04,399 --> 02:42:07,190
that's going to be an
obvious like everyone will have like

9942
02:42:07,190 --> 02:42:07,200
obvious like everyone will have like
 

9943
02:42:07,200 --> 02:42:08,150
obvious like everyone will have like
obviously you have

9944
02:42:08,150 --> 02:42:08,160
obviously you have
 

9945
02:42:08,160 --> 02:42:10,230
obviously you have
like why are we typing stuff in the

9946
02:42:10,230 --> 02:42:10,240
like why are we typing stuff in the
 

9947
02:42:10,240 --> 02:42:12,150
like why are we typing stuff in the
computer doesn't make any sense that's

9948
02:42:12,150 --> 02:42:12,160
computer doesn't make any sense that's
 

9949
02:42:12,160 --> 02:42:13,030
computer doesn't make any sense that's
stupid

9950
02:42:13,030 --> 02:42:13,040
stupid
 

9951
02:42:13,040 --> 02:42:15,110
stupid
people used to type on a keyboard with a

9952
02:42:15,110 --> 02:42:15,120
people used to type on a keyboard with a
 

9953
02:42:15,120 --> 02:42:16,070
people used to type on a keyboard with a
mouse

9954
02:42:16,070 --> 02:42:16,080
mouse
 

9955
02:42:16,080 --> 02:42:18,150
mouse
what is that it seems pretty clear like

9956
02:42:18,150 --> 02:42:18,160
what is that it seems pretty clear like
 

9957
02:42:18,160 --> 02:42:19,110
what is that it seems pretty clear like
we're gonna be there

9958
02:42:19,110 --> 02:42:19,120
we're gonna be there
 

9959
02:42:19,120 --> 02:42:20,710
we're gonna be there
yeah like the only question is like

9960
02:42:20,710 --> 02:42:20,720
yeah like the only question is like
 

9961
02:42:20,720 --> 02:42:22,150
yeah like the only question is like
what's the time frame is that gonna be

9962
02:42:22,150 --> 02:42:22,160
what's the time frame is that gonna be
 

9963
02:42:22,160 --> 02:42:24,550
what's the time frame is that gonna be
20 or is it 250 or 100 like how could we

9964
02:42:24,550 --> 02:42:24,560
20 or is it 250 or 100 like how could we
 

9965
02:42:24,560 --> 02:42:25,110
20 or is it 250 or 100 like how could we
not

9966
02:42:25,110 --> 02:42:25,120
not
 

9967
02:42:25,120 --> 02:42:27,190
not
and and the thing that i guess upsets

9968
02:42:27,190 --> 02:42:27,200
and and the thing that i guess upsets
 

9969
02:42:27,200 --> 02:42:28,630
and and the thing that i guess upsets
with elon and others

9970
02:42:28,630 --> 02:42:28,640
with elon and others
 

9971
02:42:28,640 --> 02:42:31,670
with elon and others
uh is the timeline he tends to do i

9972
02:42:31,670 --> 02:42:31,680
uh is the timeline he tends to do i
 

9973
02:42:31,680 --> 02:42:33,190
uh is the timeline he tends to do i
think a lot of people tend to do that

9974
02:42:33,190 --> 02:42:33,200
think a lot of people tend to do that
 

9975
02:42:33,200 --> 02:42:34,630
think a lot of people tend to do that
kind of thing i'd definitely do it which

9976
02:42:34,630 --> 02:42:34,640
kind of thing i'd definitely do it which
 

9977
02:42:34,640 --> 02:42:35,269
kind of thing i'd definitely do it which
is like

9978
02:42:35,269 --> 02:42:35,279
is like
 

9979
02:42:35,279 --> 02:42:37,750
is like
it'll be done this year right versus

9980
02:42:37,750 --> 02:42:37,760
it'll be done this year right versus
 

9981
02:42:37,760 --> 02:42:39,510
it'll be done this year right versus
like it'll be done in 10 years

9982
02:42:39,510 --> 02:42:39,520
like it'll be done in 10 years
 

9983
02:42:39,520 --> 02:42:41,349
like it'll be done in 10 years
the timeline is a little bit too rushed

9984
02:42:41,349 --> 02:42:41,359
the timeline is a little bit too rushed
 

9985
02:42:41,359 --> 02:42:43,190
the timeline is a little bit too rushed
but from our leadership perspective it

9986
02:42:43,190 --> 02:42:43,200
but from our leadership perspective it
 

9987
02:42:43,200 --> 02:42:45,269
but from our leadership perspective it
inspires the engineers

9988
02:42:45,269 --> 02:42:45,279
inspires the engineers
 

9989
02:42:45,279 --> 02:42:47,190
inspires the engineers
to uh to do the best work of their life

9990
02:42:47,190 --> 02:42:47,200
to uh to do the best work of their life
 

9991
02:42:47,200 --> 02:42:48,710
to uh to do the best work of their life
to really kind of

9992
02:42:48,710 --> 02:42:48,720
to really kind of
 

9993
02:42:48,720 --> 02:42:51,349
to really kind of
believe because to do the impossible you

9994
02:42:51,349 --> 02:42:51,359
believe because to do the impossible you
 

9995
02:42:51,359 --> 02:42:52,790
believe because to do the impossible you
have to first believe it

9996
02:42:52,790 --> 02:42:52,800
have to first believe it
 

9997
02:42:52,800 --> 02:42:55,110
have to first believe it
which is a really important aspect of

9998
02:42:55,110 --> 02:42:55,120
which is a really important aspect of
 

9999
02:42:55,120 --> 02:42:55,830
which is a really important aspect of
innovation

10000
02:42:55,830 --> 02:42:55,840
innovation
 

10001
02:42:55,840 --> 02:42:57,190
innovation
and there's the delayed discounting

10002
02:42:57,190 --> 02:42:57,200
and there's the delayed discounting
 

10003
02:42:57,200 --> 02:42:58,950
and there's the delayed discounting
aspect i talked about before it's like

10004
02:42:58,950 --> 02:42:58,960
aspect i talked about before it's like
 

10005
02:42:58,960 --> 02:43:00,389
aspect i talked about before it's like
saying oh this is going to be a thing

10006
02:43:00,389 --> 02:43:00,399
saying oh this is going to be a thing
 

10007
02:43:00,399 --> 02:43:02,710
saying oh this is going to be a thing
20 50 years from now it's like what

10008
02:43:02,710 --> 02:43:02,720
20 50 years from now it's like what
 

10009
02:43:02,720 --> 02:43:04,070
20 50 years from now it's like what
motivates anybody if you can

10010
02:43:04,070 --> 02:43:04,080
motivates anybody if you can
 

10011
02:43:04,080 --> 02:43:05,590
motivates anybody if you can
and even if you're fudging it or like

10012
02:43:05,590 --> 02:43:05,600
and even if you're fudging it or like
 

10013
02:43:05,600 --> 02:43:07,510
and even if you're fudging it or like
wishful thinking a little bit or

10014
02:43:07,510 --> 02:43:07,520
wishful thinking a little bit or
 

10015
02:43:07,520 --> 02:43:09,910
wishful thinking a little bit or
let's just say airing on one side of the

10016
02:43:09,910 --> 02:43:09,920
let's just say airing on one side of the
 

10017
02:43:09,920 --> 02:43:12,230
let's just say airing on one side of the
probability distribution

10018
02:43:12,230 --> 02:43:12,240
probability distribution
 

10019
02:43:12,240 --> 02:43:14,309
probability distribution
like there's value in saying like yeah

10020
02:43:14,309 --> 02:43:14,319
like there's value in saying like yeah
 

10021
02:43:14,319 --> 02:43:15,590
like there's value in saying like yeah
like there's a chance

10022
02:43:15,590 --> 02:43:15,600
like there's a chance
 

10023
02:43:15,600 --> 02:43:17,269
like there's a chance
we could get this done in a year and you

10024
02:43:17,269 --> 02:43:17,279
we could get this done in a year and you
 

10025
02:43:17,279 --> 02:43:18,950
we could get this done in a year and you
know what and if you set a goal for a

10026
02:43:18,950 --> 02:43:18,960
know what and if you set a goal for a
 

10027
02:43:18,960 --> 02:43:19,349
know what and if you set a goal for a
year

10028
02:43:19,349 --> 02:43:19,359
year
 

10029
02:43:19,359 --> 02:43:21,510
year
and you're not successful hey you might

10030
02:43:21,510 --> 02:43:21,520
and you're not successful hey you might
 

10031
02:43:21,520 --> 02:43:23,030
and you're not successful hey you might
get it done in three years

10032
02:43:23,030 --> 02:43:23,040
get it done in three years
 

10033
02:43:23,040 --> 02:43:25,349
get it done in three years
whereas if you had aimed at 20 years

10034
02:43:25,349 --> 02:43:25,359
whereas if you had aimed at 20 years
 

10035
02:43:25,359 --> 02:43:26,550
whereas if you had aimed at 20 years
well you either would have never done it

10036
02:43:26,550 --> 02:43:26,560
well you either would have never done it
 

10037
02:43:26,560 --> 02:43:27,349
well you either would have never done it
at all or you would

10038
02:43:27,349 --> 02:43:27,359
at all or you would
 

10039
02:43:27,359 --> 02:43:28,469
at all or you would
have aimed at 20 years and then would

10040
02:43:28,469 --> 02:43:28,479
have aimed at 20 years and then would
 

10041
02:43:28,479 --> 02:43:30,630
have aimed at 20 years and then would
have taken you 10. so

10042
02:43:30,630 --> 02:43:30,640
have taken you 10. so
 

10043
02:43:30,640 --> 02:43:32,630
have taken you 10. so
there the other thing i think about this

10044
02:43:32,630 --> 02:43:32,640
there the other thing i think about this
 

10045
02:43:32,640 --> 02:43:33,670
there the other thing i think about this
like in terms of

10046
02:43:33,670 --> 02:43:33,680
like in terms of
 

10047
02:43:33,680 --> 02:43:35,990
like in terms of
his work and and i guess we've seen with

10048
02:43:35,990 --> 02:43:36,000
his work and and i guess we've seen with
 

10049
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:37,510
his work and and i guess we've seen with
psychedelics it's like

10050
02:43:37,510 --> 02:43:37,520
psychedelics it's like
 

10051
02:43:37,520 --> 02:43:39,510
psychedelics it's like
there's a lack of appreciation for like

10052
02:43:39,510 --> 02:43:39,520
there's a lack of appreciation for like
 

10053
02:43:39,520 --> 02:43:41,030
there's a lack of appreciation for like
sort of the variability you need in

10054
02:43:41,030 --> 02:43:41,040
sort of the variability you need in
 

10055
02:43:41,040 --> 02:43:42,389
sort of the variability you need in
natural selection

10056
02:43:42,389 --> 02:43:42,399
natural selection
 

10057
02:43:42,399 --> 02:43:44,790
natural selection
sort of extrapolating from biological

10058
02:43:44,790 --> 02:43:44,800
sort of extrapolating from biological
 

10059
02:43:44,800 --> 02:43:47,269
sort of extrapolating from biological
you know from evolution like

10060
02:43:47,269 --> 02:43:47,279
you know from evolution like
 

10061
02:43:47,279 --> 02:43:50,309
you know from evolution like
hey maybe he's wrong about focusing only

10062
02:43:50,309 --> 02:43:50,319
hey maybe he's wrong about focusing only
 

10063
02:43:50,319 --> 02:43:51,510
hey maybe he's wrong about focusing only
on the cameras and not these other

10064
02:43:51,510 --> 02:43:51,520
on the cameras and not these other
 

10065
02:43:51,520 --> 02:43:52,309
on the cameras and not these other
things

10066
02:43:52,309 --> 02:43:52,319
things
 

10067
02:43:52,319 --> 02:43:54,230
things
be empirically driven it's like yeah you

10068
02:43:54,230 --> 02:43:54,240
be empirically driven it's like yeah you
 

10069
02:43:54,240 --> 02:43:56,150
be empirically driven it's like yeah you
need to like when he's

10070
02:43:56,150 --> 02:43:56,160
need to like when he's
 

10071
02:43:56,160 --> 02:43:57,110
need to like when he's
you know when you need to get the

10072
02:43:57,110 --> 02:43:57,120
you know when you need to get the
 

10073
02:43:57,120 --> 02:43:58,469
you know when you need to get the
regulation is it safe enough to get this

10074
02:43:58,469 --> 02:43:58,479
regulation is it safe enough to get this
 

10075
02:43:58,479 --> 02:43:59,429
regulation is it safe enough to get this
thing on the road those are real

10076
02:43:59,429 --> 02:43:59,439
thing on the road those are real
 

10077
02:43:59,439 --> 02:44:00,070
thing on the road those are real
questions and

10078
02:44:00,070 --> 02:44:00,080
questions and
 

10079
02:44:00,080 --> 02:44:01,830
questions and
be empirically driven and if he can meet

10080
02:44:01,830 --> 02:44:01,840
be empirically driven and if he can meet
 

10081
02:44:01,840 --> 02:44:03,190
be empirically driven and if he can meet
the whatever standard is

10082
02:44:03,190 --> 02:44:03,200
the whatever standard is
 

10083
02:44:03,200 --> 02:44:05,670
the whatever standard is
is relevant that's the standard and be

10084
02:44:05,670 --> 02:44:05,680
is relevant that's the standard and be
 

10085
02:44:05,680 --> 02:44:07,190
is relevant that's the standard and be
driven by that so don't let it affect

10086
02:44:07,190 --> 02:44:07,200
driven by that so don't let it affect
 

10087
02:44:07,200 --> 02:44:08,630
driven by that so don't let it affect
your ethics but

10088
02:44:08,630 --> 02:44:08,640
your ethics but
 

10089
02:44:08,640 --> 02:44:11,269
your ethics but
if he's on the wrong path how wonderful

10090
02:44:11,269 --> 02:44:11,279
if he's on the wrong path how wonderful
 

10091
02:44:11,279 --> 02:44:12,710
if he's on the wrong path how wonderful
someone's exploring that wrong path he's

10092
02:44:12,710 --> 02:44:12,720
someone's exploring that wrong path he's
 

10093
02:44:12,720 --> 02:44:13,910
someone's exploring that wrong path he's
going to figure out it's the wrong path

10094
02:44:13,910 --> 02:44:13,920
going to figure out it's the wrong path
 

10095
02:44:13,920 --> 02:44:16,309
going to figure out it's the wrong path
and like other people he's damn it he's

10096
02:44:16,309 --> 02:44:16,319
and like other people he's damn it he's
 

10097
02:44:16,319 --> 02:44:17,269
and like other people he's damn it he's
doing something

10098
02:44:17,269 --> 02:44:17,279
doing something
 

10099
02:44:17,279 --> 02:44:20,790
doing something
yeah like he's you know and

10100
02:44:20,790 --> 02:44:20,800
yeah like he's you know and
 

10101
02:44:20,800 --> 02:44:23,269
yeah like he's you know and
and so appreciating that variability

10102
02:44:23,269 --> 02:44:23,279
and so appreciating that variability
 

10103
02:44:23,279 --> 02:44:25,190
and so appreciating that variability
yeah you know that like it's

10104
02:44:25,190 --> 02:44:25,200
yeah you know that like it's
 

10105
02:44:25,200 --> 02:44:27,349
yeah you know that like it's
it's valuable even if he's not on i mean

10106
02:44:27,349 --> 02:44:27,359
it's valuable even if he's not on i mean
 

10107
02:44:27,359 --> 02:44:28,950
it's valuable even if he's not on i mean
this is all over the place in

10108
02:44:28,950 --> 02:44:28,960
this is all over the place in
 

10109
02:44:28,960 --> 02:44:31,349
this is all over the place in
in science it's like a good theory one

10110
02:44:31,349 --> 02:44:31,359
in science it's like a good theory one
 

10111
02:44:31,359 --> 02:44:32,230
in science it's like a good theory one
standard

10112
02:44:32,230 --> 02:44:32,240
standard
 

10113
02:44:32,240 --> 02:44:33,990
standard
definition is that it generates testable

hypotheses
 

10117
02:44:35,279 --> 02:44:37,910
hypotheses
and like the ultimate model is never

10118
02:44:37,910 --> 02:44:37,920
and like the ultimate model is never
 

10119
02:44:37,920 --> 02:44:39,269
and like the ultimate model is never
going to be the same as reality some

02:44:39,269 --> 02:44:39,279
going to be the same as reality some
 

10121
02:44:39,279 --> 02:44:40,309
going to be the same as reality some
models are going to work better than

10122
02:44:40,309 --> 02:44:40,319
models are going to work better than
 

10123
02:44:40,319 --> 02:44:41,349
models are going to work better than
others like

10124
02:44:41,349 --> 02:44:41,359
others like
 

10125
02:44:41,359 --> 02:44:44,870
others like
you know newtonian physics got us a long

10126
02:44:44,870 --> 02:44:44,880
you know newtonian physics got us a long
 

10127
02:44:44,880 --> 02:44:46,070
you know newtonian physics got us a long
ways

10128
02:44:46,070 --> 02:44:46,080
ways
 

10129
02:44:46,080 --> 02:44:49,030
ways
even if there was a better model like

10130
02:44:49,030 --> 02:44:49,040
even if there was a better model like
 

10131
02:44:49,040 --> 02:44:51,190
even if there was a better model like
waiting and some models weren't

10132
02:44:51,190 --> 02:44:51,200
waiting and some models weren't
 

10133
02:44:51,200 --> 02:44:52,790
waiting and some models weren't
as good as you know were never that

10134
02:44:52,790 --> 02:44:52,800
as good as you know were never that
 

10135
02:44:52,800 --> 02:44:54,389
as good as you know were never that
successful but just even like

10136
02:44:54,389 --> 02:44:54,399
successful but just even like
 

10137
02:44:54,399 --> 02:44:56,469
successful but just even like
putting them out there and testing we

10138
02:44:56,469 --> 02:44:56,479
putting them out there and testing we
 

10139
02:44:56,479 --> 02:44:57,670
putting them out there and testing we
wouldn't know something is

10140
02:44:57,670 --> 02:44:57,680
wouldn't know something is
 

10141
02:44:57,680 --> 02:44:59,510
wouldn't know something is
a bad model until someone puts it out

10142
02:44:59,510 --> 02:44:59,520
a bad model until someone puts it out
 

10143
02:44:59,520 --> 02:45:00,710
a bad model until someone puts it out
anyway so yeah

10144
02:45:00,710 --> 02:45:00,720
anyway so yeah
 

10145
02:45:00,720 --> 02:45:03,190
anyway so yeah
uh diversity of ideas is essential for

10146
02:45:03,190 --> 02:45:03,200
uh diversity of ideas is essential for
 

10147
02:45:03,200 --> 02:45:05,030
uh diversity of ideas is essential for
progress yeah

10148
02:45:05,030 --> 02:45:05,040
progress yeah
 

10149
02:45:05,040 --> 02:45:06,950
progress yeah
so we brought up consciousness a few

10150
02:45:06,950 --> 02:45:06,960
so we brought up consciousness a few
 

10151
02:45:06,960 --> 02:45:09,670
so we brought up consciousness a few
times there's several things i want to

10152
02:45:09,670 --> 02:45:09,680
times there's several things i want to
 

10153
02:45:09,680 --> 02:45:11,670
times there's several things i want to
kind of disentangle there so one you've

10154
02:45:11,670 --> 02:45:11,680
kind of disentangle there so one you've
 

10155
02:45:11,680 --> 02:45:13,190
kind of disentangle there so one you've
recently wrote a paper titled

10156
02:45:13,190 --> 02:45:13,200
recently wrote a paper titled
 

10157
02:45:13,200 --> 02:45:15,910
recently wrote a paper titled
consciousness religion and gurus

10158
02:45:15,910 --> 02:45:15,920
consciousness religion and gurus
 

10159
02:45:15,920 --> 02:45:19,110
consciousness religion and gurus
pitfalls of psychedelic medicine

10160
02:45:19,110 --> 02:45:19,120
pitfalls of psychedelic medicine
 

10161
02:45:19,120 --> 02:45:20,790
pitfalls of psychedelic medicine
so that's one side of it you've kind of

10162
02:45:20,790 --> 02:45:20,800
so that's one side of it you've kind of
 

10163
02:45:20,800 --> 02:45:22,550
so that's one side of it you've kind of
already mentioned that these terms can

10164
02:45:22,550 --> 02:45:22,560
already mentioned that these terms can
 

10165
02:45:22,560 --> 02:45:24,469
already mentioned that these terms can
be a little bit misused

10166
02:45:24,469 --> 02:45:24,479
be a little bit misused
 

10167
02:45:24,479 --> 02:45:28,870
be a little bit misused
or are used in a variety of ways

10168
02:45:28,870 --> 02:45:28,880
or are used in a variety of ways
 

10169
02:45:28,880 --> 02:45:32,309
or are used in a variety of ways
that they can they can be confusing

10170
02:45:32,309 --> 02:45:32,319
that they can they can be confusing
 

10171
02:45:32,319 --> 02:45:36,469
that they can they can be confusing
but in a specific way

10172
02:45:36,469 --> 02:45:36,479

 

10173
02:45:36,479 --> 02:45:38,150

as much as we can be specific about

10174
02:45:38,150 --> 02:45:38,160
as much as we can be specific about
 

10175
02:45:38,160 --> 02:45:40,309
as much as we can be specific about
these things about the actual heart

10176
02:45:40,309 --> 02:45:40,319
these things about the actual heart
 

10177
02:45:40,319 --> 02:45:41,590
these things about the actual heart
problem of consciousness or

10178
02:45:41,590 --> 02:45:41,600
problem of consciousness or
 

10179
02:45:41,600 --> 02:45:43,030
problem of consciousness or
understanding what is

10180
02:45:43,030 --> 02:45:43,040
understanding what is
 

10181
02:45:43,040 --> 02:45:45,510
understanding what is
consciousness this weird thing that it

10182
02:45:45,510 --> 02:45:45,520
consciousness this weird thing that it
 

10183
02:45:45,520 --> 02:45:46,630
consciousness this weird thing that it
feels like

10184
02:45:46,630 --> 02:45:46,640
feels like
 

10185
02:45:46,640 --> 02:45:48,950
feels like
it feels like something to experience

10186
02:45:48,950 --> 02:45:48,960
it feels like something to experience
 

10187
02:45:48,960 --> 02:45:50,710
it feels like something to experience
things

10188
02:45:50,710 --> 02:45:50,720
things
 

10189
02:45:50,720 --> 02:45:54,309
things
have psychedelics giving you

10190
02:45:54,309 --> 02:45:54,319
have psychedelics giving you
 

10191
02:45:54,319 --> 02:45:56,550
have psychedelics giving you
some kind of insight on what is

10192
02:45:56,550 --> 02:45:56,560
some kind of insight on what is
 

10193
02:45:56,560 --> 02:45:58,070
some kind of insight on what is
consciousness

10194
02:45:58,070 --> 02:45:58,080
consciousness
 

10195
02:45:58,080 --> 02:45:59,990
consciousness
you've mentioned that it feels like

10196
02:45:59,990 --> 02:46:00,000
you've mentioned that it feels like
 

10197
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:03,510
you've mentioned that it feels like
psychedelics allows you to kind of

10198
02:46:03,510 --> 02:46:03,520
psychedelics allows you to kind of
 

10199
02:46:03,520 --> 02:46:06,710
psychedelics allows you to kind of
dismantle your sense of self

10200
02:46:06,710 --> 02:46:06,720
dismantle your sense of self
 

10201
02:46:06,720 --> 02:46:10,710
dismantle your sense of self
like step outside of yourself

10202
02:46:10,710 --> 02:46:10,720
like step outside of yourself
 

10203
02:46:10,720 --> 02:46:13,590
like step outside of yourself
so that feels like somehow playing with

10204
02:46:13,590 --> 02:46:13,600
so that feels like somehow playing with
 

10205
02:46:13,600 --> 02:46:15,830
so that feels like somehow playing with
this mechanism of consciousness

10206
02:46:15,830 --> 02:46:15,840
this mechanism of consciousness
 

10207
02:46:15,840 --> 02:46:17,910
this mechanism of consciousness
and if it is in fact playing with a

10208
02:46:17,910 --> 02:46:17,920
and if it is in fact playing with a
 

10209
02:46:17,920 --> 02:46:19,269
and if it is in fact playing with a
mechanism of consciousness

10210
02:46:19,269 --> 02:46:19,279
mechanism of consciousness
 

10211
02:46:19,279 --> 02:46:21,910
mechanism of consciousness
using just a few chemicals it feels like

10212
02:46:21,910 --> 02:46:21,920
using just a few chemicals it feels like
 

10213
02:46:21,920 --> 02:46:22,309
using just a few chemicals it feels like
we're

10214
02:46:22,309 --> 02:46:22,319
we're
 

10215
02:46:22,319 --> 02:46:25,349
we're
very much in the neighborhood of being

10216
02:46:25,349 --> 02:46:25,359
very much in the neighborhood of being
 

10217
02:46:25,359 --> 02:46:27,590
very much in the neighborhood of being
able to maybe understand

10218
02:46:27,590 --> 02:46:27,600
able to maybe understand
 

10219
02:46:27,600 --> 02:46:30,230
able to maybe understand
the actual biological mechanisms of how

10220
02:46:30,230 --> 02:46:30,240
the actual biological mechanisms of how
 

10221
02:46:30,240 --> 02:46:32,630
the actual biological mechanisms of how
consciousness can emerge from the brain

10222
02:46:32,630 --> 02:46:32,640
consciousness can emerge from the brain
 

10223
02:46:32,640 --> 02:46:34,790
consciousness can emerge from the brain
so yeah there's there's a bunch there i

10224
02:46:34,790 --> 02:46:34,800
so yeah there's there's a bunch there i
 

10225
02:46:34,800 --> 02:46:37,269
so yeah there's there's a bunch there i
think my preface is that

10226
02:46:37,269 --> 02:46:37,279
think my preface is that
 

10227
02:46:37,279 --> 02:46:39,510
think my preface is that
i certainly have opinions that are

10228
02:46:39,510 --> 02:46:39,520
i certainly have opinions that are
 

10229
02:46:39,520 --> 02:46:40,870
i certainly have opinions that are
outside that i can say

10230
02:46:40,870 --> 02:46:40,880
outside that i can say
 

10231
02:46:40,880 --> 02:46:44,389
outside that i can say
here are my best speculations as a as a

10232
02:46:44,389 --> 02:46:44,399
here are my best speculations as a as a
 

10233
02:46:44,399 --> 02:46:46,550
here are my best speculations as a as a
as just a person and an armchair

10234
02:46:46,550 --> 02:46:46,560
as just a person and an armchair
 

10235
02:46:46,560 --> 02:46:47,910
as just a person and an armchair
philosopher and it's that

10236
02:46:47,910 --> 02:46:47,920
philosopher and it's that
 

10237
02:46:47,920 --> 02:46:49,750
philosopher and it's that
philosophy is certainly not my my

10238
02:46:49,750 --> 02:46:49,760
philosophy is certainly not my my
 

10239
02:46:49,760 --> 02:46:52,550
philosophy is certainly not my my
training and my expertise um so i have

10240
02:46:52,550 --> 02:46:52,560
training and my expertise um so i have
 

10241
02:46:52,560 --> 02:46:54,469
training and my expertise um so i have
thoughts there but that that i recognize

10242
02:46:54,469 --> 02:46:54,479
thoughts there but that that i recognize
 

10243
02:46:54,479 --> 02:46:55,990
thoughts there but that that i recognize
are completely in the realm of

10244
02:46:55,990 --> 02:46:56,000
are completely in the realm of
 

10245
02:46:56,000 --> 02:46:57,190
are completely in the realm of
speculation

10246
02:46:57,190 --> 02:46:57,200
speculation
 

10247
02:46:57,200 --> 02:46:59,269
speculation
that are like things that i would love

10248
02:46:59,269 --> 02:46:59,279
that are like things that i would love
 

10249
02:46:59,279 --> 02:47:01,590
that are like things that i would love
to wrap empirical science around but

10250
02:47:01,590 --> 02:47:01,600
to wrap empirical science around but
 

10251
02:47:01,600 --> 02:47:03,349
to wrap empirical science around but
that are

10252
02:47:03,349 --> 02:47:03,359
that are
 

10253
02:47:03,359 --> 02:47:06,469
that are
you know there's no data

10254
02:47:06,469 --> 02:47:06,479
you know there's no data
 

10255
02:47:06,479 --> 02:47:08,550
you know there's no data
and getting to the hard problem like no

10256
02:47:08,550 --> 02:47:08,560
and getting to the hard problem like no
 

10257
02:47:08,560 --> 02:47:10,309
and getting to the hard problem like no
conceivable way even though i'm

10258
02:47:10,309 --> 02:47:10,319
conceivable way even though i'm
 

10259
02:47:10,319 --> 02:47:13,269
conceivable way even though i'm
i'm very open like i'm hoping that that

10260
02:47:13,269 --> 02:47:13,279
i'm very open like i'm hoping that that
 

10261
02:47:13,279 --> 02:47:15,590
i'm very open like i'm hoping that that
problem can be cracked and i do i

10262
02:47:15,590 --> 02:47:15,600
problem can be cracked and i do i
 

10263
02:47:15,600 --> 02:47:17,190
problem can be cracked and i do i
as an armchair philosopher i do think

10264
02:47:17,190 --> 02:47:17,200
as an armchair philosopher i do think
 

10265
02:47:17,200 --> 02:47:18,469
as an armchair philosopher i do think
that is a problem i don't think it can

10266
02:47:18,469 --> 02:47:18,479
that is a problem i don't think it can
 

10267
02:47:18,479 --> 02:47:20,630
that is a problem i don't think it can
be dismissed as some people argue it's

10268
02:47:20,630 --> 02:47:20,640
be dismissed as some people argue it's
 

10269
02:47:20,640 --> 02:47:22,790
be dismissed as some people argue it's
not even really a problem

10270
02:47:22,790 --> 02:47:22,800
not even really a problem
 

10271
02:47:22,800 --> 02:47:24,790
not even really a problem
it strikes me that explaining just the

10272
02:47:24,790 --> 02:47:24,800
it strikes me that explaining just the
 

10273
02:47:24,800 --> 02:47:26,710
it strikes me that explaining just the
existence of phenomenal consciousness

10274
02:47:26,710 --> 02:47:26,720
existence of phenomenal consciousness
 

10275
02:47:26,720 --> 02:47:29,269
existence of phenomenal consciousness
is a problem so anyway i very much keep

10276
02:47:29,269 --> 02:47:29,279
is a problem so anyway i very much keep
 

10277
02:47:29,279 --> 02:47:31,110
is a problem so anyway i very much keep
that divide in mind when i talk about

10278
02:47:31,110 --> 02:47:31,120
that divide in mind when i talk about
 

10279
02:47:31,120 --> 02:47:32,309
that divide in mind when i talk about
these things what we

10280
02:47:32,309 --> 02:47:32,319
these things what we
 

10281
02:47:32,319 --> 02:47:33,990
these things what we
can really say about what we've learned

10282
02:47:33,990 --> 02:47:34,000
can really say about what we've learned
 

10283
02:47:34,000 --> 02:47:34,870
can really say about what we've learned
through science including by

10284
02:47:34,870 --> 02:47:34,880
through science including by
 

10285
02:47:34,880 --> 02:47:36,870
through science including by
psychedelics versus like

10286
02:47:36,870 --> 02:47:36,880
psychedelics versus like
 

10287
02:47:36,880 --> 02:47:39,830
psychedelics versus like
what i can speculate on in in terms of

10288
02:47:39,830 --> 02:47:39,840
what i can speculate on in in terms of
 

10289
02:47:39,840 --> 02:47:40,389
what i can speculate on in in terms of
you know

10290
02:47:40,389 --> 02:47:40,399
you know
 

10291
02:47:40,399 --> 02:47:42,550
you know
the nature of reality and consciousness

10292
02:47:42,550 --> 02:47:42,560
the nature of reality and consciousness
 

10293
02:47:42,560 --> 02:47:43,670
the nature of reality and consciousness
but

10294
02:47:43,670 --> 02:47:43,680
but
 

10295
02:47:43,680 --> 02:47:48,309
but
in terms of by and large

10296
02:47:48,309 --> 02:47:48,319
in terms of by and large
 

10297
02:47:48,319 --> 02:47:50,790
in terms of by and large
skeptically i have to say psychedelics

10298
02:47:50,790 --> 02:47:50,800
skeptically i have to say psychedelics
 

10299
02:47:50,800 --> 02:47:52,150
skeptically i have to say psychedelics
have not really taught us

10300
02:47:52,150 --> 02:47:52,160
have not really taught us
 

10301
02:47:52,160 --> 02:47:54,790
have not really taught us
anything about the nature of

consciousness so consciousness can refer
 

10315
02:48:05,760 --> 02:48:06,630
consciousness so consciousness can refer
to not only

10316
02:48:06,630 --> 02:48:06,640
to not only
 

10317
02:48:06,640 --> 02:48:08,469
to not only
just phenomenal consciousness which is

10318
02:48:08,469 --> 02:48:08,479
just phenomenal consciousness which is
 

10319
02:48:08,479 --> 02:48:10,070
just phenomenal consciousness which is
like you know

10320
02:48:10,070 --> 02:48:10,080
like you know
 

10321
02:48:10,080 --> 02:48:12,150
like you know
the the source of the hard problem and

10322
02:48:12,150 --> 02:48:12,160
the the source of the hard problem and
 

10323
02:48:12,160 --> 02:48:14,070
the the source of the hard problem and
what it is to be like nagel's

10324
02:48:14,070 --> 02:48:14,080
what it is to be like nagel's
 

10325
02:48:14,080 --> 02:48:17,590
what it is to be like nagel's
um description but um

10326
02:48:17,590 --> 02:48:17,600
um description but um
 

10327
02:48:17,600 --> 02:48:19,750
um description but um
the sense of self or so which can be a

10328
02:48:19,750 --> 02:48:19,760
the sense of self or so which can be a
 

10329
02:48:19,760 --> 02:48:21,670
the sense of self or so which can be a
sort of like the the experiential

10330
02:48:21,670 --> 02:48:21,680
sort of like the the experiential
 

10331
02:48:21,680 --> 02:48:23,510
sort of like the the experiential
self momentum or it can be like the

10332
02:48:23,510 --> 02:48:23,520
self momentum or it can be like the
 

10333
02:48:23,520 --> 02:48:25,429
self momentum or it can be like the
narrative self the stringing together of

10334
02:48:25,429 --> 02:48:25,439
narrative self the stringing together of
 

10335
02:48:25,439 --> 02:48:26,710
narrative self the stringing together of
story so

10336
02:48:26,710 --> 02:48:26,720
story so
 

10337
02:48:26,720 --> 02:48:29,349
story so
those are things that i think can be and

10338
02:48:29,349 --> 02:48:29,359
those are things that i think can be and
 

10339
02:48:29,359 --> 02:48:31,429
those are things that i think can be and
a little bit's been done

10340
02:48:31,429 --> 02:48:31,439
a little bit's been done
 

10341
02:48:31,439 --> 02:48:34,870
a little bit's been done
with with psychedelics regarding that

10342
02:48:34,870 --> 02:48:34,880
with with psychedelics regarding that
 

10343
02:48:34,880 --> 02:48:37,190
with with psychedelics regarding that
but i i think there's far more potential

10344
02:48:37,190 --> 02:48:37,200
but i i think there's far more potential
 

10345
02:48:37,200 --> 02:48:39,190
but i i think there's far more potential
like

10346
02:48:39,190 --> 02:48:39,200
like
 

10347
02:48:39,200 --> 02:48:43,190
like
but so like one story that unfolded is

10348
02:48:43,190 --> 02:48:43,200
but so like one story that unfolded is
 

10349
02:48:43,200 --> 02:48:45,429
but so like one story that unfolded is
that psychedelics acutely having

10350
02:48:45,429 --> 02:48:45,439
that psychedelics acutely having
 

10351
02:48:45,439 --> 02:48:48,309
that psychedelics acutely having
effects on the default mode network a

10352
02:48:48,309 --> 02:48:48,319
effects on the default mode network a

02:48:48,319 --> 02:48:50,790
effects on the default mode network a

certain a pattern of activation amongst
 

10355
02:48:50,800 --> 02:48:53,269
certain a pattern of activation amongst
a subset of brain areas that is

10356
02:48:53,269 --> 02:48:53,279
a subset of brain areas that is
 

10357
02:48:53,279 --> 02:48:55,110
a subset of brain areas that is
associated with self-referential

between these um uh areas like uh
 

10365
02:49:01,920 --> 02:49:04,070

the posterior cingulate cortex and the
 

10367
02:49:04,080 --> 02:49:05,910
the posterior cingulate cortex and the

medial prefrontal cortex for example
 

10369
02:49:05,920 --> 02:49:07,590

being parts of this that are

being parts of this that are

02:49:10,960 --> 02:49:12,630
sort of
thinking about yourself remembering

10376
02:49:12,630 --> 02:49:12,640
thinking about yourself remembering
 

10377
02:49:12,640 --> 02:49:14,230
thinking about yourself remembering
yourself in the past projecting yourself

into the future
 

10381
02:49:15,520 --> 02:49:17,590
into the future
and so that it's an interesting story

10382
02:49:17,590 --> 02:49:17,600
and so that it's an interesting story
 

10383
02:49:17,600 --> 02:49:19,670
and so that it's an interesting story
emerged when

10384
02:49:19,670 --> 02:49:19,680
emerged when
 

10385
02:49:19,680 --> 02:49:23,030
emerged when
it was found that when psilocybin is on

10386
02:49:23,030 --> 02:49:23,040
it was found that when psilocybin is on
 

10387
02:49:23,040 --> 02:49:23,670
it was found that when psilocybin is on
board

10388
02:49:23,670 --> 02:49:23,680
board
 

10389
02:49:23,680 --> 02:49:25,750
board
you know in the person system that

10390
02:49:25,750 --> 02:49:25,760
you know in the person system that
 

10391
02:49:25,760 --> 02:49:27,750
you know in the person system that
there's a d there's less communication

10392
02:49:27,750 --> 02:49:27,760
there's a d there's less communication
 

10393
02:49:27,760 --> 02:49:28,550
there's a d there's less communication
amongst these

10394
02:49:28,550 --> 02:49:28,560
amongst these
 

10395
02:49:28,560 --> 02:49:31,590
amongst these
these areas so with resting state fmri

10396
02:49:31,590 --> 02:49:31,600
these areas so with resting state fmri
 

10397
02:49:31,600 --> 02:49:32,870
these areas so with resting state fmri
imaging that there's

10398
02:49:32,870 --> 02:49:32,880
imaging that there's
 

10399
02:49:32,880 --> 02:49:35,429
imaging that there's
there's less synchronization or

10400
02:49:35,429 --> 02:49:35,439
there's less synchronization or
 

10401
02:49:35,439 --> 02:49:37,590
there's less synchronization or
presumably communication between these

10402
02:49:37,590 --> 02:49:37,600
presumably communication between these
 

10403
02:49:37,600 --> 02:49:40,630
presumably communication between these
areas and so i think it was it has been

10404
02:49:40,630 --> 02:49:40,640
areas and so i think it was it has been
 

10405
02:49:40,640 --> 02:49:41,830
areas and so i think it was it has been
overstated into

10406
02:49:41,830 --> 02:49:41,840
overstated into
 

10407
02:49:41,840 --> 02:49:43,429
overstated into
ah we see this is like this is the

10408
02:49:43,429 --> 02:49:43,439
ah we see this is like this is the
 

10409
02:49:43,439 --> 02:49:45,269
ah we see this is like this is the
dissolving of the ego

10410
02:49:45,269 --> 02:49:45,279
dissolving of the ego
 

10411
02:49:45,279 --> 02:49:47,750
dissolving of the ego
this is it the story made a whole lot of

10412
02:49:47,750 --> 02:49:47,760
this is it the story made a whole lot of
 

10413
02:49:47,760 --> 02:49:49,030
this is it the story made a whole lot of
sense but

10414
02:49:49,030 --> 02:49:49,040
sense but
 

10415
02:49:49,040 --> 02:49:52,230
sense but
there's several i think that story is

10416
02:49:52,230 --> 02:49:52,240
there's several i think that story is
 

10417
02:49:52,240 --> 02:49:54,150
there's several i think that story is
really being challenged like one we see

10418
02:49:54,150 --> 02:49:54,160
really being challenged like one we see
 

10419
02:49:54,160 --> 02:49:56,550
really being challenged like one we see
increasing number of drugs that are

10420
02:49:56,550 --> 02:49:56,560
increasing number of drugs that are
 

10421
02:49:56,560 --> 02:49:59,349
increasing number of drugs that are
that that decouple that network

10422
02:49:59,349 --> 02:49:59,359
that that decouple that network
 

10423
02:49:59,359 --> 02:50:01,190
that that decouple that network
including ones like that

10424
02:50:01,190 --> 02:50:01,200
including ones like that
 

10425
02:50:01,200 --> 02:50:03,670
including ones like that
aren't psychedelic so this may just be a

10426
02:50:03,670 --> 02:50:03,680
aren't psychedelic so this may just be a
 

10427
02:50:03,680 --> 02:50:04,389
aren't psychedelic so this may just be a
property

10428
02:50:04,389 --> 02:50:04,399
property
 

10429
02:50:04,399 --> 02:50:07,030
property
frankly of being like you know screwed

10430
02:50:07,030 --> 02:50:07,040
frankly of being like you know screwed
 

10431
02:50:07,040 --> 02:50:08,070
frankly of being like you know screwed
up you know like

10432
02:50:08,070 --> 02:50:08,080
up you know like
 

10433
02:50:08,080 --> 02:50:09,269
up you know like
you know being out of your head being

10434
02:50:09,269 --> 02:50:09,279
you know being out of your head being
 

10435
02:50:09,279 --> 02:50:11,349
you know being out of your head being
like like you know anytime you mess with

10436
02:50:11,349 --> 02:50:11,359
like like you know anytime you mess with
 

10437
02:50:11,359 --> 02:50:13,269
like like you know anytime you mess with
the perception system maybe

10438
02:50:13,269 --> 02:50:13,279
the perception system maybe
 

10439
02:50:13,279 --> 02:50:16,230
the perception system maybe
it screws up some some uh just our

10440
02:50:16,230 --> 02:50:16,240
it screws up some some uh just our
 

10441
02:50:16,240 --> 02:50:18,150
it screws up some some uh just our
ability to just function in the

10442
02:50:18,150 --> 02:50:18,160
ability to just function in the
 

10443
02:50:18,160 --> 02:50:19,670
ability to just function in the
holistically like we do

10444
02:50:19,670 --> 02:50:19,680
holistically like we do
 

10445
02:50:19,680 --> 02:50:22,150
holistically like we do
in order yeah for the brain to perceive

10446
02:50:22,150 --> 02:50:22,160
in order yeah for the brain to perceive
 

10447
02:50:22,160 --> 02:50:24,150
in order yeah for the brain to perceive
stuff to be able to map it to memory to

10448
02:50:24,150 --> 02:50:24,160
stuff to be able to map it to memory to
 

10449
02:50:24,160 --> 02:50:24,870
stuff to be able to map it to memory to
connect

connect
 

10451
02:50:24,880 --> 02:50:26,550
connect
things together to their their whole

that that could just be messed with

10456
02:50:30,230 --> 02:50:30,240
that that could just be messed with
 

10457
02:50:30,240 --> 02:50:32,150
that that could just be messed with
right and it couldn't i'm speculating it

10458
02:50:32,150 --> 02:50:32,160
right and it couldn't i'm speculating it
 

10459
02:50:32,160 --> 02:50:33,349
right and it couldn't i'm speculating it
could be tied to more if you had to

these different drugs and so
 

10511
02:51:15,920 --> 02:51:18,469
these different drugs and so
and then you also see just broad broad

02:51:27,190 --> 02:51:27,200
soon although so i think
 

10521
02:51:27,200 --> 02:51:29,190
soon although so i think
in the story that the dmn the default

you say that

10530

you say that
 

10531
02:51:35,600 --> 02:51:38,710
you say that
it's the ego and that's just like

it's the ego and that's just like
 

10533
02:51:38,720 --> 02:51:41,110
it's the ego and that's just like
but self-referential processing if you

02:51:41,110 --> 02:51:41,120
but self-referential processing if you
 

10535
02:51:41,120 --> 02:51:41,990
but self-referential processing if you
go that far

10536

go that far
 

10537
02:51:42,000 --> 02:51:44,389
go that far
like that was already known before

psychedelic psychedelics didn't

10540
02:51:46,710 --> 02:51:46,720
psychedelic psychedelics didn't
 

10541
02:51:46,720 --> 02:51:49,670
psychedelic psychedelics didn't
really contribute to that the idea that

10542
02:51:49,670 --> 02:51:49,680
really contribute to that the idea that
 

10543
02:51:49,680 --> 02:51:50,309
really contribute to that the idea that
this

10544

this
 

10545
02:51:50,319 --> 02:51:52,710
this
type of brain network activity was

10546
02:51:52,710 --> 02:51:52,720
type of brain network activity was
 

10547
02:51:52,720 --> 02:51:56,150
type of brain network activity was
related to a sense of self

10548
02:51:56,150 --> 02:51:56,160
related to a sense of self
 

10549
02:51:56,160 --> 02:51:59,349
related to a sense of self
but it is absolutely striking that

02:51:59,349 --> 02:51:59,359
but it is absolutely striking that
 

10551
02:51:59,359 --> 02:52:01,110

psychedelics that people report with
 

10553
02:52:01,120 --> 02:52:02,870
psychedelics that people report with
pretty high reliability these unity

02:52:02,870 --> 02:52:02,880
pretty high reliability these unity
 

10555
02:52:02,880 --> 02:52:04,630
pretty high reliability these unity

experiences that
 

10557
02:52:04,640 --> 02:52:07,110
experiences that
where people subjectively like like they

think we can do a lot with that in terms

02:52:16,710 --> 02:52:16,720
think we can do a lot with that in terms
 

10569
02:52:16,720 --> 02:52:18,550
think we can do a lot with that in terms
of figuring out the nature of

of figuring out the nature of
 

10571
02:52:18,560 --> 02:52:21,190
of figuring out the nature of
the sense of self now i don't think

10572
02:52:21,190 --> 02:52:21,200
the sense of self now i don't think
 

10573
02:52:21,200 --> 02:52:23,670
the sense of self now i don't think
that's the same as the hard problem or

10574
02:52:23,670 --> 02:52:23,680
that's the same as the hard problem or
 

10575
02:52:23,680 --> 02:52:25,030
that's the same as the hard problem or
or the existence of phenomenal

or the existence of phenomenal
 

10577

a sense of self it will talk as if

of computations that results and somehow

and i think this is the argument with
 

10601
02:52:51,200 --> 02:52:53,590
and i think this is the argument with
with humans but some have speculated

with humans but some have speculated
 

10603
02:52:53,600 --> 02:52:55,510
with humans but some have speculated
this why do we have this illusion of the

this why do we have this illusion of the
 

10605
02:52:55,520 --> 02:52:57,429
this why do we have this illusion of the
self that's that's evolved that

02:53:14,950 --> 02:53:14,960
at play and behaviorally acting like
 

10621
02:53:14,960 --> 02:53:17,110
at play and behaviorally acting like
you know there is a there is a self that

10622
02:53:17,110 --> 02:53:17,120
you know there is a there is a self that
 

10623
02:53:17,120 --> 02:53:18,230
you know there is a there is a self that
might kind of work

10624
02:53:18,230 --> 02:53:18,240
might kind of work
 

10625
02:53:18,240 --> 02:53:21,510
might kind of work
and so you can program a computer or a

10626
02:53:21,510 --> 02:53:21,520
and so you can program a computer or a
 

10627
02:53:21,520 --> 02:53:22,830
and so you can program a computer or a
robot

10628
02:53:22,830 --> 02:53:22,840
robot
 

10629
02:53:22,840 --> 02:53:25,670
robot
um to basically demonstrate

10630
02:53:25,670 --> 02:53:25,680
um to basically demonstrate
 

10631
02:53:25,680 --> 02:53:27,349
um to basically demonstrate
have an algorithm like that and

10632
02:53:27,349 --> 02:53:27,359
have an algorithm like that and
 

10633
02:53:27,359 --> 02:53:29,429
have an algorithm like that and
demonstrate that type of behavior and i

10634
02:53:29,429 --> 02:53:29,439
demonstrate that type of behavior and i
 

10635
02:53:29,439 --> 02:53:30,950
demonstrate that type of behavior and i
think that's completely silent on

10636
02:53:30,950 --> 02:53:30,960
think that's completely silent on
 

10637
02:53:30,960 --> 02:53:32,550
think that's completely silent on
whether there's an actual experience

10638
02:53:32,550 --> 02:53:32,560
whether there's an actual experience
 

10639
02:53:32,560 --> 02:53:33,670
whether there's an actual experience
inside there

10640
02:53:33,670 --> 02:53:33,680
inside there
 

10641
02:53:33,680 --> 02:53:35,990
inside there
i've been um struggling to find the

10642
02:53:35,990 --> 02:53:36,000
i've been um struggling to find the
 

10643
02:53:36,000 --> 02:53:37,830
i've been um struggling to find the
right words and how i feel about that

10644
02:53:37,830 --> 02:53:37,840
right words and how i feel about that
 

10645
02:53:37,840 --> 02:53:39,910
right words and how i feel about that
whole thing but

10646
02:53:39,910 --> 02:53:39,920
whole thing but
 

10647
02:53:39,920 --> 02:53:42,469
whole thing but
because i've said it poorly before i've

10648
02:53:42,469 --> 02:53:42,479
because i've said it poorly before i've
 

10649
02:53:42,479 --> 02:53:44,230
because i've said it poorly before i've
before said that there's no difference

10650
02:53:44,230 --> 02:53:44,240
before said that there's no difference
 

10651
02:53:44,240 --> 02:53:45,670
before said that there's no difference
between the appearance

10652
02:53:45,670 --> 02:53:45,680
between the appearance
 

10653
02:53:45,680 --> 02:53:48,710
between the appearance
and the actual existence

10654
02:53:48,710 --> 02:53:48,720
and the actual existence
 

10655
02:53:48,720 --> 02:53:50,630
and the actual existence
of consciousness or intelligence or any

10656
02:53:50,630 --> 02:53:50,640
of consciousness or intelligence or any
 

10657
02:53:50,640 --> 02:53:52,710
of consciousness or intelligence or any
of that what i really mean

10658
02:53:52,710 --> 02:53:52,720
of that what i really mean
 

10659
02:53:52,720 --> 02:53:56,070
of that what i really mean
is the

10660
02:53:56,070 --> 02:53:56,080
is the
 

10661
02:53:56,080 --> 02:53:58,710
is the
the more the appearance starts to be

10662
02:53:58,710 --> 02:53:58,720
the more the appearance starts to be
 

10663
02:53:58,720 --> 02:53:59,510
the more the appearance starts to be
look like

10664
02:53:59,510 --> 02:53:59,520
look like
 

10665
02:53:59,520 --> 02:54:02,070
look like
the thing the more there's this area

10666
02:54:02,070 --> 02:54:02,080
the thing the more there's this area
 

10667
02:54:02,080 --> 02:54:03,269
the thing the more there's this area
where it's like

10668
02:54:03,269 --> 02:54:03,279
where it's like
 

10669
02:54:03,279 --> 02:54:06,950
where it's like
i don't think i don't

10670
02:54:06,950 --> 02:54:06,960
i don't think i don't
 

10671
02:54:06,960 --> 02:54:10,550
i don't think i don't
our whole idea of what is real

10672
02:54:10,550 --> 02:54:10,560
our whole idea of what is real
 

10673
02:54:10,560 --> 02:54:14,309
our whole idea of what is real
and what is just an illusion is um

10674
02:54:14,309 --> 02:54:14,319
and what is just an illusion is um
 

10675
02:54:14,319 --> 02:54:17,349
and what is just an illusion is um
not the right way to think about it so

10676
02:54:17,349 --> 02:54:17,359
not the right way to think about it so
 

10677
02:54:17,359 --> 02:54:19,349
not the right way to think about it so
the whole idea is like if you create a

10678
02:54:19,349 --> 02:54:19,359
the whole idea is like if you create a
 

10679
02:54:19,359 --> 02:54:20,550
the whole idea is like if you create a
system

10680
02:54:20,550 --> 02:54:20,560
system
 

10681
02:54:20,560 --> 02:54:24,309
system
that looks like it's having fun the more

10682
02:54:24,309 --> 02:54:24,319
that looks like it's having fun the more
 

10683
02:54:24,319 --> 02:54:26,790
that looks like it's having fun the more
it's realistically able to portray

10684
02:54:26,790 --> 02:54:26,800
it's realistically able to portray
 

10685
02:54:26,800 --> 02:54:27,990
it's realistically able to portray
itself as having

10686
02:54:27,990 --> 02:54:28,000
itself as having
 

10687
02:54:28,000 --> 02:54:31,030
itself as having
fun like there's a certain gray area

10688
02:54:31,030 --> 02:54:31,040
fun like there's a certain gray area
 

10689
02:54:31,040 --> 02:54:34,389
fun like there's a certain gray area
which it's the system is having fun uh

10690
02:54:34,389 --> 02:54:34,399
which it's the system is having fun uh
 

10691
02:54:34,399 --> 02:54:35,910
which it's the system is having fun uh
and same with intelligence same with

10692
02:54:35,910 --> 02:54:35,920
and same with intelligence same with
 

10693
02:54:35,920 --> 02:54:39,030
and same with intelligence same with
consciousness and we humans want to

10694
02:54:39,030 --> 02:54:39,040
consciousness and we humans want to
 

10695
02:54:39,040 --> 02:54:41,349
consciousness and we humans want to
simplify like it feels like the way we

10696
02:54:41,349 --> 02:54:41,359
simplify like it feels like the way we
 

10697
02:54:41,359 --> 02:54:42,950
simplify like it feels like the way we
simplify the existence

10698
02:54:42,950 --> 02:54:42,960
simplify the existence
 

10699
02:54:42,960 --> 02:54:45,990
simplify the existence
and the illusion of something uh is

10700
02:54:45,990 --> 02:54:46,000
and the illusion of something uh is
 

10701
02:54:46,000 --> 02:54:49,349
and the illusion of something uh is
is uh missing the whole truth of the

10702
02:54:49,349 --> 02:54:49,359
is uh missing the whole truth of the
 

10703
02:54:49,359 --> 02:54:51,110
is uh missing the whole truth of the
nature of reality which we're not

10704
02:54:51,110 --> 02:54:51,120
nature of reality which we're not
 

10705
02:54:51,120 --> 02:54:53,429
nature of reality which we're not
yet able to understand like it's the one

10706
02:54:53,429 --> 02:54:53,439
yet able to understand like it's the one
 

10707
02:54:53,439 --> 02:54:55,030
yet able to understand like it's the one
percent we only understand one percent

10708
02:54:55,030 --> 02:54:55,040
percent we only understand one percent
 

10709
02:54:55,040 --> 02:54:55,750
percent we only understand one percent
currently so

10710
02:54:55,750 --> 02:54:55,760
currently so
 

10711
02:54:55,760 --> 02:54:58,309
currently so
we don't have the right uh physics to

10712
02:54:58,309 --> 02:54:58,319
we don't have the right uh physics to
 

10713
02:54:58,319 --> 02:54:59,590
we don't have the right uh physics to
talk about things we don't have the

10714
02:54:59,590 --> 02:54:59,600
talk about things we don't have the
 

10715
02:54:59,600 --> 02:55:01,269
talk about things we don't have the
right science to talk about things but

10716
02:55:01,269 --> 02:55:01,279
right science to talk about things but
 

10717
02:55:01,279 --> 02:55:04,630
right science to talk about things but
to me like the um uh

10718
02:55:04,630 --> 02:55:04,640
to me like the um uh
 

10719
02:55:04,640 --> 02:55:07,830
to me like the um uh
faking it and actually it being true

10720
02:55:07,830 --> 02:55:07,840
faking it and actually it being true
 

10721
02:55:07,840 --> 02:55:10,950
faking it and actually it being true
is um

10722
02:55:10,950 --> 02:55:10,960

 

10723
02:55:10,960 --> 02:55:12,790

the the difference is much smaller than

10724
02:55:12,790 --> 02:55:12,800
the the difference is much smaller than
 

10725
02:55:12,800 --> 02:55:15,429
the the difference is much smaller than
what humans would like to imagine

10726
02:55:15,429 --> 02:55:15,439
what humans would like to imagine
 

10727
02:55:15,439 --> 02:55:17,269
what humans would like to imagine
that's my intuition but philosophers

10728
02:55:17,269 --> 02:55:17,279
that's my intuition but philosophers
 

10729
02:55:17,279 --> 02:55:19,750
that's my intuition but philosophers
hate that because

10730
02:55:19,750 --> 02:55:19,760
hate that because
 

10731
02:55:19,760 --> 02:55:22,230
hate that because
and uh guess what it's philosophers what

10732
02:55:22,230 --> 02:55:22,240
and uh guess what it's philosophers what
 

10733
02:55:22,240 --> 02:55:24,150
and uh guess what it's philosophers what
have you actually built

10734
02:55:24,150 --> 02:55:24,160
have you actually built
 

10735
02:55:24,160 --> 02:55:26,790
have you actually built
uh so like to me is that's the

10736
02:55:26,790 --> 02:55:26,800
uh so like to me is that's the
 

10737
02:55:26,800 --> 02:55:27,990
uh so like to me is that's the
difference between philosophy and

10738
02:55:27,990 --> 02:55:28,000
difference between philosophy and
 

10739
02:55:28,000 --> 02:55:28,790
difference between philosophy and
engineering

10740
02:55:28,790 --> 02:55:28,800
engineering
 

10741
02:55:28,800 --> 02:55:31,429
engineering
it feels like if we push the creation

10742
02:55:31,429 --> 02:55:31,439
it feels like if we push the creation
 

10743
02:55:31,439 --> 02:55:32,790
it feels like if we push the creation
the engineering

10744
02:55:32,790 --> 02:55:32,800
the engineering
 

10745
02:55:32,800 --> 02:55:34,710
the engineering
like fake it until you make it all the

10746
02:55:34,710 --> 02:55:34,720
like fake it until you make it all the
 

10747
02:55:34,720 --> 02:55:37,030
like fake it until you make it all the
way which is like fake consciousness

10748
02:55:37,030 --> 02:55:37,040
way which is like fake consciousness
 

10749
02:55:37,040 --> 02:55:39,910
way which is like fake consciousness
until you realize holy crap this thing

10750
02:55:39,910 --> 02:55:39,920
until you realize holy crap this thing
 

10751
02:55:39,920 --> 02:55:41,190
until you realize holy crap this thing
is conscious

10752
02:55:41,190 --> 02:55:41,200
is conscious
 

10753
02:55:41,200 --> 02:55:43,030
is conscious
fake intelligence until you realize holy

10754
02:55:43,030 --> 02:55:43,040
fake intelligence until you realize holy
 

10755
02:55:43,040 --> 02:55:44,630
fake intelligence until you realize holy
crap this is intelligence

10756
02:55:44,630 --> 02:55:44,640
crap this is intelligence
 

10757
02:55:44,640 --> 02:55:47,110
crap this is intelligence
and from the my curiosity with

10758
02:55:47,110 --> 02:55:47,120
and from the my curiosity with
 

10759
02:55:47,120 --> 02:55:48,230
and from the my curiosity with
psychedelics

10760
02:55:48,230 --> 02:55:48,240
psychedelics
 

10761
02:55:48,240 --> 02:55:51,910
psychedelics
and just neurobiology neuroscience

10762
02:55:51,910 --> 02:55:51,920
and just neurobiology neuroscience
 

10763
02:55:51,920 --> 02:55:55,590
and just neurobiology neuroscience
is like it feels i'm i love the armchair

10764
02:55:55,590 --> 02:55:55,600
is like it feels i'm i love the armchair
 

10765
02:55:55,600 --> 02:55:57,830
is like it feels i'm i love the armchair
i love sitting in that armchair because

10766
02:55:57,830 --> 02:55:57,840
i love sitting in that armchair because
 

10767
02:55:57,840 --> 02:55:59,590
i love sitting in that armchair because
it feels like at a certain point you're

10768
02:55:59,590 --> 02:55:59,600
it feels like at a certain point you're
 

10769
02:55:59,600 --> 02:56:01,750
it feels like at a certain point you're
going to think about this problem

10770
02:56:01,750 --> 02:56:01,760
going to think about this problem
 

10771
02:56:01,760 --> 02:56:05,110
going to think about this problem
and there's going to be an aha moment

10772
02:56:05,110 --> 02:56:05,120
and there's going to be an aha moment
 

10773
02:56:05,120 --> 02:56:06,710
and there's going to be an aha moment
like that's what the armchair does

10774
02:56:06,710 --> 02:56:06,720
like that's what the armchair does
 

10775
02:56:06,720 --> 02:56:08,469
like that's what the armchair does
sometimes science prevents you from

10776
02:56:08,469 --> 02:56:08,479
sometimes science prevents you from
 

10777
02:56:08,479 --> 02:56:09,590
sometimes science prevents you from
really thinking

10778
02:56:09,590 --> 02:56:09,600
really thinking
 

10779
02:56:09,600 --> 02:56:14,230
really thinking
right wait like it's really simple

10780
02:56:14,230 --> 02:56:14,240
right wait like it's really simple
 

10781
02:56:14,240 --> 02:56:15,910
right wait like it's really simple
there's something really simple like

10782
02:56:15,910 --> 02:56:15,920
there's something really simple like
 

10783
02:56:15,920 --> 02:56:17,910
there's something really simple like
there's some that could be

10784
02:56:17,910 --> 02:56:17,920
there's some that could be
 

10785
02:56:17,920 --> 02:56:21,349
there's some that could be
some dance of chemicals that we're

10786
02:56:21,349 --> 02:56:21,359
some dance of chemicals that we're
 

10787
02:56:21,359 --> 02:56:23,110
some dance of chemicals that we're
totally unaware of not from

10788
02:56:23,110 --> 02:56:23,120
totally unaware of not from
 

10789
02:56:23,120 --> 02:56:25,349
totally unaware of not from
not from aspects of like which chemicals

10790
02:56:25,349 --> 02:56:25,359
not from aspects of like which chemicals
 

10791
02:56:25,359 --> 02:56:26,630
not from aspects of like which chemicals
to combine

10792
02:56:26,630 --> 02:56:26,640
to combine
 

10793
02:56:26,640 --> 02:56:29,349
to combine
with which biological architectures but

10794
02:56:29,349 --> 02:56:29,359
with which biological architectures but
 

10795
02:56:29,359 --> 02:56:31,510
with which biological architectures but
more like we were thinking of it

10796
02:56:31,510 --> 02:56:31,520
more like we were thinking of it
 

10797
02:56:31,520 --> 02:56:33,670
more like we were thinking of it
completely wrong

10798
02:56:33,670 --> 02:56:33,680
completely wrong
 

10799
02:56:33,680 --> 02:56:37,269
completely wrong
that uh just just

10800
02:56:37,269 --> 02:56:37,279
that uh just just
 

10801
02:56:37,279 --> 02:56:39,910
that uh just just
out of the blue like maybe the human

10802
02:56:39,910 --> 02:56:39,920
out of the blue like maybe the human
 

10803
02:56:39,920 --> 02:56:40,469
out of the blue like maybe the human
mind

10804
02:56:40,469 --> 02:56:40,479
mind
 

10805
02:56:40,479 --> 02:56:42,710
mind
is just like a radio that tunes into

10806
02:56:42,710 --> 02:56:42,720
is just like a radio that tunes into
 

10807
02:56:42,720 --> 02:56:44,070
is just like a radio that tunes into
some other medium

10808
02:56:44,070 --> 02:56:44,080
some other medium
 

10809
02:56:44,080 --> 02:56:46,150
some other medium
where consciousness actually exists like

10810
02:56:46,150 --> 02:56:46,160
where consciousness actually exists like
 

10811
02:56:46,160 --> 02:56:47,429
where consciousness actually exists like
those uh

10812
02:56:47,429 --> 02:56:47,439
those uh
 

10813
02:56:47,439 --> 02:56:50,070
those uh
weird sort of hypothetical like maybe

10814
02:56:50,070 --> 02:56:50,080
weird sort of hypothetical like maybe
 

10815
02:56:50,080 --> 02:56:52,070
weird sort of hypothetical like maybe
we're just thinking about the human mind

10816
02:56:52,070 --> 02:56:52,080
we're just thinking about the human mind
 

10817
02:56:52,080 --> 02:56:54,150
we're just thinking about the human mind
totally wrong maybe there's no such

10818
02:56:54,150 --> 02:56:54,160
totally wrong maybe there's no such
 

10819
02:56:54,160 --> 02:56:55,750
totally wrong maybe there's no such
thing as individual

10820
02:56:55,750 --> 02:56:55,760
thing as individual
 

10821
02:56:55,760 --> 02:56:58,070
thing as individual
intelligence maybe it is all collective

10822
02:56:58,070 --> 02:56:58,080
intelligence maybe it is all collective
 

10823
02:56:58,080 --> 02:57:00,070
intelligence maybe it is all collective
intelligence between humans

10824
02:57:00,070 --> 02:57:00,080
intelligence between humans
 

10825
02:57:00,080 --> 02:57:02,230
intelligence between humans
like maybe the intelligence is possessed

10826
02:57:02,230 --> 02:57:02,240
like maybe the intelligence is possessed
 

10827
02:57:02,240 --> 02:57:03,590
like maybe the intelligence is possessed
in the communication

10828
02:57:03,590 --> 02:57:03,600
in the communication
 

10829
02:57:03,600 --> 02:57:06,389
in the communication
of language between minds and then in

10830
02:57:06,389 --> 02:57:06,399
of language between minds and then in
 

10831
02:57:06,399 --> 02:57:07,990
of language between minds and then in
fact consciousness is a property

10832
02:57:07,990 --> 02:57:08,000
fact consciousness is a property
 

10833
02:57:08,000 --> 02:57:11,190
fact consciousness is a property
of that language uh versus

10834
02:57:11,190 --> 02:57:11,200
of that language uh versus
 

10835
02:57:11,200 --> 02:57:13,269
of that language uh versus
a property of the individual minds and

10836
02:57:13,269 --> 02:57:13,279
a property of the individual minds and
 

10837
02:57:13,279 --> 02:57:14,309
a property of the individual minds and
somehow the

10838
02:57:14,309 --> 02:57:14,319
somehow the
 

10839
02:57:14,319 --> 02:57:15,750
somehow the
neurotransmitters will be able to

10840
02:57:15,750 --> 02:57:15,760
neurotransmitters will be able to
 

10841
02:57:15,760 --> 02:57:17,670
neurotransmitters will be able to
connect to that so uh

10842
02:57:17,670 --> 02:57:17,680
connect to that so uh
 

10843
02:57:17,680 --> 02:57:20,469
connect to that so uh
then ai systems can join that common

10844
02:57:20,469 --> 02:57:20,479
then ai systems can join that common
 

10845
02:57:20,479 --> 02:57:22,150
then ai systems can join that common
collective intelligence that common

10846
02:57:22,150 --> 02:57:22,160
collective intelligence that common
 

10847
02:57:22,160 --> 02:57:23,030
collective intelligence that common
language

10848
02:57:23,030 --> 02:57:23,040
language
 

10849
02:57:23,040 --> 02:57:24,630
language
you know like just thinking completely

10850
02:57:24,630 --> 02:57:24,640
you know like just thinking completely
 

10851
02:57:24,640 --> 02:57:25,830
you know like just thinking completely
outside of the box i just said how much

10852
02:57:25,830 --> 02:57:25,840
outside of the box i just said how much
 

10853
02:57:25,840 --> 02:57:26,550
outside of the box i just said how much
a crazy thing

10854
02:57:26,550 --> 02:57:26,560
a crazy thing
 

10855
02:57:26,560 --> 02:57:28,309
a crazy thing
i don't know but but thinking outside

10856
02:57:28,309 --> 02:57:28,319
i don't know but but thinking outside
 

10857
02:57:28,319 --> 02:57:29,750
i don't know but but thinking outside
the box uh

10858
02:57:29,750 --> 02:57:29,760
the box uh
 

10859
02:57:29,760 --> 02:57:32,309
the box uh
and there's something about subtle

10860
02:57:32,309 --> 02:57:32,319
and there's something about subtle
 

10861
02:57:32,319 --> 02:57:34,230
and there's something about subtle
manipulation of the chemicals of the

10862
02:57:34,230 --> 02:57:34,240
manipulation of the chemicals of the
 

10863
02:57:34,240 --> 02:57:35,190
manipulation of the chemicals of the
brain

10864
02:57:35,190 --> 02:57:35,200
brain
 

10865
02:57:35,200 --> 02:57:38,469
brain
which feels like the best

10866
02:57:38,469 --> 02:57:38,479
which feels like the best
 

10867
02:57:38,479 --> 02:57:41,030
which feels like the best
or one of the great chances of the

10868
02:57:41,030 --> 02:57:41,040
or one of the great chances of the
 

10869
02:57:41,040 --> 02:57:42,469
or one of the great chances of the
scientific

10870
02:57:42,469 --> 02:57:42,479
scientific
 

10871
02:57:42,479 --> 02:57:44,469
scientific
process leading us to an actual

10872
02:57:44,469 --> 02:57:44,479
process leading us to an actual
 

10873
02:57:44,479 --> 02:57:46,710
process leading us to an actual
understanding of the hard problem

10874
02:57:46,710 --> 02:57:46,720
understanding of the hard problem
 

10875
02:57:46,720 --> 02:57:50,230
understanding of the hard problem
so i am very hopeful that and so i

10876
02:57:50,230 --> 02:57:50,240
so i am very hopeful that and so i
 

10877
02:57:50,240 --> 02:57:52,309
so i am very hopeful that and so i
i mean i'm a radical empiricist which

10878
02:57:52,309 --> 02:57:52,319
i mean i'm a radical empiricist which
 

10879
02:57:52,319 --> 02:57:54,150
i mean i'm a radical empiricist which
i'm i'm very strong with with that like

10880
02:57:54,150 --> 02:57:54,160
i'm i'm very strong with with that like
 

10881
02:57:54,160 --> 02:57:55,429
i'm i'm very strong with with that like
that's what

10882
02:57:55,429 --> 02:57:55,439
that's what
 

10883
02:57:55,439 --> 02:57:57,830
that's what
you know so you know science isn't about

10884
02:57:57,830 --> 02:57:57,840
you know so you know science isn't about
 

10885
02:57:57,840 --> 02:57:58,790
you know so you know science isn't about
ultimately being

10886
02:57:58,790 --> 02:57:58,800
ultimately being
 

10887
02:57:58,800 --> 02:58:00,710
ultimately being
a materialist it's like it's about being

10888
02:58:00,710 --> 02:58:00,720
a materialist it's like it's about being
 

10889
02:58:00,720 --> 02:58:02,550
a materialist it's like it's about being
an empiricist in my view

10890
02:58:02,550 --> 02:58:02,560
an empiricist in my view
 

10891
02:58:02,560 --> 02:58:04,389
an empiricist in my view
and so for example i'm very fascinated

10892
02:58:04,389 --> 02:58:04,399
and so for example i'm very fascinated
 

10893
02:58:04,399 --> 02:58:06,230
and so for example i'm very fascinated
by the so-called psi phenomenon

10894
02:58:06,230 --> 02:58:06,240
by the so-called psi phenomenon
 

10895
02:58:06,240 --> 02:58:07,590
by the so-called psi phenomenon
you know like stuff that people just

10896
02:58:07,590 --> 02:58:07,600
you know like stuff that people just
 

10897
02:58:07,600 --> 02:58:10,309
you know like stuff that people just
kind of reject out of hand um

10898
02:58:10,309 --> 02:58:10,319
kind of reject out of hand um
 

10899
02:58:10,319 --> 02:58:12,150
kind of reject out of hand um
you know i kind of orient towards that

10900
02:58:12,150 --> 02:58:12,160
you know i kind of orient towards that
 

10901
02:58:12,160 --> 02:58:14,870
you know i kind of orient towards that
stuff with with an idea of um

10902
02:58:14,870 --> 02:58:14,880
stuff with with an idea of um
 

10903
02:58:14,880 --> 02:58:16,710
stuff with with an idea of um
you know hey look you know what we

10904
02:58:16,710 --> 02:58:16,720
you know hey look you know what we
 

10905
02:58:16,720 --> 02:58:17,990
you know hey look you know what we
consider like anything

10906
02:58:17,990 --> 02:58:18,000
consider like anything
 

10907
02:58:18,000 --> 02:58:21,110
consider like anything
exist is natural and so but the boundary

10908
02:58:21,110 --> 02:58:21,120
exist is natural and so but the boundary
 

10909
02:58:21,120 --> 02:58:23,429
exist is natural and so but the boundary
of what what what we observe in nature

10910
02:58:23,429 --> 02:58:23,439
of what what what we observe in nature
 

10911
02:58:23,439 --> 02:58:25,910
of what what what we observe in nature
like what we recognize as in nature

10912
02:58:25,910 --> 02:58:25,920
like what we recognize as in nature
 

10913
02:58:25,920 --> 02:58:27,110
like what we recognize as in nature
moves like

10914
02:58:27,110 --> 02:58:27,120
moves like
 

10915
02:58:27,120 --> 02:58:28,630
moves like
what we do today and what we know today

10916
02:58:28,630 --> 02:58:28,640
what we do today and what we know today
 

10917
02:58:28,640 --> 02:58:30,630
what we do today and what we know today
would only be described as magic 500

10918
02:58:30,630 --> 02:58:30,640
would only be described as magic 500
 

10919
02:58:30,640 --> 02:58:31,990
would only be described as magic 500
years ago or even 100 years

10920
02:58:31,990 --> 02:58:32,000
years ago or even 100 years
 

10921
02:58:32,000 --> 02:58:34,630
years ago or even 100 years
ago some of it so there will surely be

10922
02:58:34,630 --> 02:58:34,640
ago some of it so there will surely be
 

10923
02:58:34,640 --> 02:58:35,990
ago some of it so there will surely be
things that

10924
02:58:35,990 --> 02:58:36,000
things that
 

10925
02:58:36,000 --> 02:58:37,750
things that
like you explain these phenomena that

10926
02:58:37,750 --> 02:58:37,760
like you explain these phenomena that
 

10927
02:58:37,760 --> 02:58:39,429
like you explain these phenomena that
just sound like completely

10928
02:58:39,429 --> 02:58:39,439
just sound like completely
 

10929
02:58:39,439 --> 02:58:41,670
just sound like completely
they're supernatural now where there may

10930
02:58:41,670 --> 02:58:41,680
they're supernatural now where there may
 

10931
02:58:41,680 --> 02:58:42,790
they're supernatural now where there may
be for some of it

10932
02:58:42,790 --> 02:58:42,800
be for some of it
 

10933
02:58:42,800 --> 02:58:43,990
be for some of it
like some of it might turn out to be a

10934
02:58:43,990 --> 02:58:44,000
like some of it might turn out to be a
 

10935
02:58:44,000 --> 02:58:45,590
like some of it might turn out to be a
complete bunk and some of it might turn

10936
02:58:45,590 --> 02:58:45,600
complete bunk and some of it might turn
 

10937
02:58:45,600 --> 02:58:46,550
complete bunk and some of it might turn
out to be

10938
02:58:46,550 --> 02:58:46,560
out to be
 

10939
02:58:46,560 --> 02:58:48,950
out to be
um it's just another layer of nature

10940
02:58:48,950 --> 02:58:48,960
um it's just another layer of nature
 

10941
02:58:48,960 --> 02:58:49,910
um it's just another layer of nature
whether we're talking about

10942
02:58:49,910 --> 02:58:49,920
whether we're talking about
 

10943
02:58:49,920 --> 02:58:51,429
whether we're talking about
multiple dimensions that are invoked or

10944
02:58:51,429 --> 02:58:51,439
multiple dimensions that are invoked or
 

10945
02:58:51,439 --> 02:58:52,790
multiple dimensions that are invoked or
something we have don't even have the

10946
02:58:52,790 --> 02:58:52,800
something we have don't even have the
 

10947
02:58:52,800 --> 02:58:53,590
something we have don't even have the
language towards

10948
02:58:53,590 --> 02:58:53,600
language towards
 

10949
02:58:53,600 --> 02:58:55,110
language towards
and what you're saying about the moving

10950
02:58:55,110 --> 02:58:55,120
and what you're saying about the moving
 

10951
02:58:55,120 --> 02:58:57,349
and what you're saying about the moving
together the model

10952
02:58:57,349 --> 02:58:57,359
together the model
 

10953
02:58:57,359 --> 02:58:59,670
together the model
and the real thing of conscious like i'm

10954
02:58:59,670 --> 02:58:59,680
and the real thing of conscious like i'm
 

10955
02:58:59,680 --> 02:59:01,190
and the real thing of conscious like i'm
very sympathetic to that so that's that

10956
02:59:01,190 --> 02:59:01,200
very sympathetic to that so that's that
 

10957
02:59:01,200 --> 02:59:01,990
very sympathetic to that so that's that
part of like

10958
02:59:01,990 --> 02:59:02,000
part of like
 

10959
02:59:02,000 --> 02:59:04,150
part of like
on the arm share side where i i want to

10960
02:59:04,150 --> 02:59:04,160
on the arm share side where i i want to
 

10961
02:59:04,160 --> 02:59:05,990
on the arm share side where i i want to
be clear i can't say this as a scientist

10962
02:59:05,990 --> 02:59:06,000
be clear i can't say this as a scientist
 

10963
02:59:06,000 --> 02:59:08,550
be clear i can't say this as a scientist
but just terms of speculating

10964
02:59:08,550 --> 02:59:08,560
but just terms of speculating
 

10965
02:59:08,560 --> 02:59:12,550
but just terms of speculating
i i find myself attracted to these um

10966
02:59:12,550 --> 02:59:12,560
i i find myself attracted to these um
 

10967
02:59:12,560 --> 02:59:14,389
i i find myself attracted to these um
more of the the sort of the the pan

10968
02:59:14,389 --> 02:59:14,399
more of the the sort of the the pan
 

10969

more of the the sort of the the pan
psychism ideas and that

10970
02:59:16,309 --> 02:59:16,319
psychism ideas and that
 

10971
02:59:16,319 --> 02:59:17,670
psychism ideas and that
kind of makes sense to me i don't know

10972
02:59:17,670 --> 02:59:17,680
kind of makes sense to me i don't know
 

10973
02:59:17,680 --> 02:59:19,030
kind of makes sense to me i don't know
if that's what you meant there but it

10974
02:59:19,030 --> 02:59:19,040
if that's what you meant there but it
 

10975
02:59:19,040 --> 02:59:21,510
if that's what you meant there but it
seemed like related the sense that

10976
02:59:21,510 --> 02:59:21,520
seemed like related the sense that
 

10977
02:59:21,520 --> 02:59:24,710
seemed like related the sense that
ultimately if

10978
02:59:24,710 --> 02:59:24,720
ultimately if
 

10979
02:59:24,720 --> 02:59:26,950
ultimately if
if if you were completely modeling like

10980
02:59:26,950 --> 02:59:26,960
if if you were completely modeling like
 

10981
02:59:26,960 --> 02:59:28,710
if if you were completely modeling like
it's like if you completely modeling

10982
02:59:28,710 --> 02:59:28,720
it's like if you completely modeling
 

10983
02:59:28,720 --> 02:59:31,190
it's like if you completely modeling
unless you dismiss like the the idea

10984
02:59:31,190 --> 02:59:31,200
unless you dismiss like the the idea
 

10985
02:59:31,200 --> 02:59:32,870
unless you dismiss like the the idea
that there is a phenomenal consciousness

10986
02:59:32,870 --> 02:59:32,880
that there is a phenomenal consciousness
 

10987
02:59:32,880 --> 02:59:34,389
that there is a phenomenal consciousness
which i think is hard given that we all

10988
02:59:34,389 --> 02:59:34,399
which i think is hard given that we all
 

10989
02:59:34,399 --> 02:59:36,150
which i think is hard given that we all
i seem like i have one that's really all

10990
02:59:36,150 --> 02:59:36,160
i seem like i have one that's really all
 

10991
02:59:36,160 --> 02:59:37,590
i seem like i have one that's really all
i i know but

10992
02:59:37,590 --> 02:59:37,600
i i know but
 

10993
02:59:37,600 --> 02:59:40,070
i i know but
if that's so compelling i can't just

10994
02:59:40,070 --> 02:59:40,080
if that's so compelling i can't just
 

10995
02:59:40,080 --> 02:59:40,630
if that's so compelling i can't just
dismiss

10996
02:59:40,630 --> 02:59:40,640
dismiss
 

10997
02:59:40,640 --> 02:59:43,990
dismiss
that like if you're if if you take that

10998
02:59:43,990 --> 02:59:44,000
that like if you're if if you take that
 

10999
02:59:44,000 --> 02:59:45,510
that like if you're if if you take that
as a given then

11000
02:59:45,510 --> 02:59:45,520
as a given then
 

11001
02:59:45,520 --> 02:59:47,269
as a given then
the only way for the model and the and

11002
02:59:47,269 --> 02:59:47,279
the only way for the model and the and
 

11003
02:59:47,279 --> 02:59:48,950
the only way for the model and the and
the real thing to merge

11004
02:59:48,950 --> 02:59:48,960
the real thing to merge
 

11005
02:59:48,960 --> 02:59:54,150
the real thing to merge
is if there is something baked into

11006
02:59:54,150 --> 02:59:54,160
is if there is something baked into
 

11007
02:59:54,160 --> 02:59:56,550
is if there is something baked into
the nature of reality you know sort of

11008
02:59:56,550 --> 02:59:56,560
the nature of reality you know sort of
 

11009
02:59:56,560 --> 02:59:57,830
the nature of reality you know sort of
like in the history of like there are

11010
02:59:57,830 --> 02:59:57,840
like in the history of like there are
 

11011
02:59:57,840 --> 03:00:00,150
like in the history of like there are
certain just like fundamental forces or

11012
03:00:00,150 --> 03:00:00,160
certain just like fundamental forces or
 

11013
03:00:00,160 --> 03:00:02,230
certain just like fundamental forces or
fundamental like and that and that's

11014
03:00:02,230 --> 03:00:02,240
fundamental like and that and that's
 

11015
03:00:02,240 --> 03:00:04,150
fundamental like and that and that's
been useful for us and sometimes we find

11016
03:00:04,150 --> 03:00:04,160
been useful for us and sometimes we find
 

11017
03:00:04,160 --> 03:00:05,110
been useful for us and sometimes we find
out that that's pointing towards

11018
03:00:05,110 --> 03:00:05,120
out that that's pointing towards
 

11019
03:00:05,120 --> 03:00:08,150
out that that's pointing towards
something else or sometimes it's still

11020
03:00:08,150 --> 03:00:08,160
something else or sometimes it's still
 

11021
03:00:08,160 --> 03:00:09,190
something else or sometimes it's still
seems like it's a fundamental and

11022
03:00:09,190 --> 03:00:09,200
seems like it's a fundamental and
 

11023
03:00:09,200 --> 03:00:10,469
seems like it's a fundamental and
sometimes it's a placeholder for someone

11024
03:00:10,469 --> 03:00:10,479
sometimes it's a placeholder for someone
 

11025
03:00:10,479 --> 03:00:11,590
sometimes it's a placeholder for someone
to figure out but there's something like

11026
03:00:11,590 --> 03:00:11,600
to figure out but there's something like
 

11027
03:00:11,600 --> 03:00:12,630
to figure out but there's something like
this is just a given

11028
03:00:12,630 --> 03:00:12,640
this is just a given
 

11029
03:00:12,640 --> 03:00:14,870
this is just a given
you know this is just you know and

11030
03:00:14,870 --> 03:00:14,880
you know this is just you know and
 

11031
03:00:14,880 --> 03:00:16,230
you know this is just you know and
sometimes something like gravity seems

11032
03:00:16,230 --> 03:00:16,240
sometimes something like gravity seems
 

11033
03:00:16,240 --> 03:00:17,349
sometimes something like gravity seems
like a very good place holder and

11034
03:00:17,349 --> 03:00:17,359
like a very good place holder and
 

11035
03:00:17,359 --> 03:00:18,630
like a very good place holder and
there's something better that comes to

11036
03:00:18,630 --> 03:00:18,640
there's something better that comes to
 

11037
03:00:18,640 --> 03:00:19,670
there's something better that comes to
replace it

11038
03:00:19,670 --> 03:00:19,680
replace it
 

11039
03:00:19,680 --> 03:00:22,230
replace it
so so you know i kind of think about

11040
03:00:22,230 --> 03:00:22,240
so so you know i kind of think about
 

11041
03:00:22,240 --> 03:00:24,070
so so you know i kind of think about
like consciousness and i didn't i kind

11042
03:00:24,070 --> 03:00:24,080
like consciousness and i didn't i kind
 

11043
03:00:24,080 --> 03:00:25,349
like consciousness and i didn't i kind
of had this inclination before i knew

11044
03:00:25,349 --> 03:00:25,359
of had this inclination before i knew
 

11045
03:00:25,359 --> 03:00:26,870
of had this inclination before i knew
there was a term for it um

11046
03:00:26,870 --> 03:00:26,880
there was a term for it um
 

11047
03:00:26,880 --> 03:00:29,910
there was a term for it um
resalient monetism the idea that which

not a very good one broadly pansexism by

11056

not a very good one broadly pansexism by
 

11057
03:00:36,640 --> 03:00:38,469
not a very good one broadly pansexism by
the way is the idea that sort of

11058
03:00:38,469 --> 03:00:38,479
the way is the idea that sort of
 

11059
03:00:38,479 --> 03:00:40,309
the way is the idea that sort of
consciousness permeates all matter

there is something to this
 

11095
03:01:18,800 --> 03:01:20,389
there is something to this
and this sounds very new agey which is

11096
03:01:20,389 --> 03:01:20,399
and this sounds very new agey which is
 

11097
03:01:20,399 --> 03:01:22,389
and this sounds very new agey which is
why it's it's very difficult and i have

11098
03:01:22,389 --> 03:01:22,399
why it's it's very difficult and i have
 

11099
03:01:22,399 --> 03:01:22,710
why it's it's very difficult and i have
a

11100
03:01:22,710 --> 03:01:22,720
a
 

11101
03:01:22,720 --> 03:01:24,870
a
high [\h__\h] like meter and everything

11102
03:01:24,870 --> 03:01:24,880
high [\h__\h] like meter and everything
 

11103
03:01:24,880 --> 03:01:27,110
high [\h__\h] like meter and everything
but like in is-ness i mean i think about

11104
03:01:27,110 --> 03:01:27,120
but like in is-ness i mean i think about
 

11105
03:01:27,120 --> 03:01:29,110
but like in is-ness i mean i think about
like huxley aldous huxley with his

11106
03:01:29,110 --> 03:01:29,120
like huxley aldous huxley with his
 

11107
03:01:29,120 --> 03:01:30,389
like huxley aldous huxley with his
mescaline experience and doors of

11108
03:01:30,389 --> 03:01:30,399
mescaline experience and doors of
 

11109
03:01:30,399 --> 03:01:32,230
mescaline experience and doors of
procession like there's an is-ness

11110
03:01:32,230 --> 03:01:32,240
procession like there's an is-ness
 

11111
03:01:32,240 --> 03:01:34,389
procession like there's an is-ness
there in know alan watson like there is

11112
03:01:34,389 --> 03:01:34,399
there in know alan watson like there is
 

11113
03:01:34,399 --> 03:01:35,349
there in know alan watson like there is
a

11114
03:01:35,349 --> 03:01:35,359
a
 

11115
03:01:35,359 --> 03:01:38,710
a
a nature of being again very new age

11116
03:01:38,710 --> 03:01:38,720
a nature of being again very new age
 

11117
03:01:38,720 --> 03:01:41,590
a nature of being again very new age
sounding but maybe there is something to

11118
03:01:41,590 --> 03:01:41,600
sounding but maybe there is something to
 

11119
03:01:41,600 --> 03:01:43,269
sounding but maybe there is something to
in and when we say consciousness we

11120
03:01:43,269 --> 03:01:43,279
in and when we say consciousness we
 

11121
03:01:43,279 --> 03:01:45,190
in and when we say consciousness we
think of like this human experience but

11122
03:01:45,190 --> 03:01:45,200
think of like this human experience but
 

11123
03:01:45,200 --> 03:01:46,070
think of like this human experience but
maybe that's just

11124
03:01:46,070 --> 03:01:46,080
maybe that's just
 

11125
03:01:46,080 --> 03:01:49,510
maybe that's just
that's so processed and so

11126
03:01:49,510 --> 03:01:49,520
that's so processed and so
 

11127
03:01:49,520 --> 03:01:52,150
that's so processed and so
that's so far so it's so derivative of

11128
03:01:52,150 --> 03:01:52,160
that's so far so it's so derivative of
 

11129
03:01:52,160 --> 03:01:53,510
that's so far so it's so derivative of
this kind of basic thing

11130
03:01:53,510 --> 03:01:53,520
this kind of basic thing
 

11131
03:01:53,520 --> 03:01:54,790
this kind of basic thing
that we wouldn't even recognize the

11132
03:01:54,790 --> 03:01:54,800
that we wouldn't even recognize the
 

11133
03:01:54,800 --> 03:01:56,469
that we wouldn't even recognize the
basic thing but the basic thing might

11134
03:01:56,469 --> 03:01:56,479
basic thing but the basic thing might
 

11135
03:01:56,479 --> 03:01:57,349
basic thing but the basic thing might
just be

11136
03:01:57,349 --> 03:01:57,359
just be
 

11137
03:01:57,359 --> 03:01:59,429
just be
this is not about the interaction

11138
03:01:59,429 --> 03:01:59,439
this is not about the interaction
 

11139
03:01:59,439 --> 03:02:03,510
this is not about the interaction
between particles this is what it is

03:02:03,510 --> 03:02:03,520
between particles this is what it is
 

11141
03:02:03,520 --> 03:02:06,309
between particles this is what it is
like to exist as a particle and maybe

11142
03:02:06,309 --> 03:02:06,319
like to exist as a particle and maybe
 

11143
03:02:06,319 --> 03:02:08,070
like to exist as a particle and maybe
it's not even particles maybe it's

11144
03:02:08,070 --> 03:02:08,080
it's not even particles maybe it's
 

11145
03:02:08,080 --> 03:02:10,070
it's not even particles maybe it's
like space-time itself i mean again

11146
03:02:10,070 --> 03:02:10,080

and something out very space-time so
 

11151
03:02:13,359 --> 03:02:14,950
and something out very space-time so
it's funny because we don't have this

11152
03:02:14,950 --> 03:02:14,960
it's funny because we don't have this
 

11153

03:02:18,399 --> 03:02:20,309

all we have is kind of uh little

03:02:20,309 --> 03:02:20,319
all we have is kind of uh little
 

11159
03:02:20,319 --> 03:02:21,590
all we have is kind of uh little
intuitions about

11160
03:02:21,590 --> 03:02:21,600
intuitions about
 

11161
03:02:21,600 --> 03:02:24,150
intuitions about
there might be something in that

11162
03:02:24,150 --> 03:02:24,160
there might be something in that
 

11163
03:02:24,160 --> 03:02:25,830
there might be something in that
direction of the darkness

11164

11165
03:02:25,840 --> 03:02:28,309

right to pursue and that that that in

right to pursue and that that that in
 

11167
03:02:28,319 --> 03:02:30,630
right to pursue and that that that in
that sense i find pan psychism uh

11168
03:02:30,630 --> 03:02:30,640
that sense i find pan psychism uh
 

11169
03:02:30,640 --> 03:02:34,389
that sense i find pan psychism uh
interesting in that like it does feel

11170
03:02:34,389 --> 03:02:34,399
interesting in that like it does feel
 

11171
03:02:34,399 --> 03:02:34,950
interesting in that like it does feel
like there's

11172
03:02:34,950 --> 03:02:34,960
like there's
 

11173
03:02:34,960 --> 03:02:36,950
like there's
something fundamental here that

11174
03:02:36,950 --> 03:02:36,960
something fundamental here that
 

11175
03:02:36,960 --> 03:02:39,190
something fundamental here that
consciousness is it's not just like

11176
03:02:39,190 --> 03:02:39,200
consciousness is it's not just like
 

11177
03:02:39,200 --> 03:02:41,429
consciousness is it's not just like
okay so the flip side consciousness

11178
03:02:41,429 --> 03:02:41,439
okay so the flip side consciousness
 

11179
03:02:41,439 --> 03:02:43,110
okay so the flip side consciousness
could be just a very

11180
03:02:43,110 --> 03:02:43,120
could be just a very
 

11181
03:02:43,120 --> 03:02:46,389
could be just a very
basic and trivial symptom

11182
03:02:46,389 --> 03:02:46,399
basic and trivial symptom
 

11183
03:02:46,399 --> 03:02:48,710
basic and trivial symptom
like like a little hack of nature that's

like like a little hack of nature that's
 

11185
03:02:48,720 --> 03:02:49,910
like like a little hack of nature that's
useful

useful
 

11187
03:02:49,920 --> 03:02:53,269
useful
uh for like survival of an organism

uh for like survival of an organism
 

11189

it's not something fundamental it's it's

that somehow has convinced us humans
 

11197
03:03:03,120 --> 03:03:04,950
that somehow has convinced us humans
because we're very human-centric we're

because we're very human-centric we're

that this is somehow really important
 

11203
03:03:08,160 --> 03:03:10,389
that this is somehow really important

but it's actually pretty obvious
 

11205
03:03:10,399 --> 03:03:12,630
but it's actually pretty obvious

but or it could be something really
 

11207
03:03:12,640 --> 03:03:14,710

fundamental to the nature of the
 

11209
03:03:14,720 --> 03:03:15,990
fundamental to the nature of the

11210

universe so
 

11211
03:03:16,000 --> 03:03:17,830
universe so
both of those are to me pretty

both of those are to me pretty
 

11213
03:03:17,840 --> 03:03:19,030
both of those are to me pretty
compelling and

11214

compelling and
 

11215
03:03:19,040 --> 03:03:20,710
compelling and
i think eventually scientifically

i think eventually scientifically

testable it is
 

11219

a scientific experiment currently
 

11223
03:03:25,680 --> 03:03:28,790
a scientific experiment currently
but i think it's that's how noble prizes

11224
03:03:28,790 --> 03:03:28,800
but i think it's that's how noble prizes

11413
03:06:45,040 --> 03:06:46,710
having the existence of stars versus
clouds of gas is a complexity the

11414
03:06:46,710 --> 03:06:46,720
clouds of gas is a complexity the
 

11415
03:06:46,720 --> 03:06:48,630
clouds of gas is a complexity the
the the entire universe has been this

11416
03:06:48,630 --> 03:06:48,640
the the entire universe has been this
 

11417
03:06:48,640 --> 03:06:50,469
the the entire universe has been this
increasing complexity

11418
03:06:50,469 --> 03:06:50,479
increasing complexity
 

11419
03:06:50,479 --> 03:06:52,389
increasing complexity
and so that kind of brings me back to

11420
03:06:52,389 --> 03:06:52,399
and so that kind of brings me back to
 

11421
03:06:52,399 --> 03:06:53,590
and so that kind of brings me back to
then the other of like

11422
03:06:53,590 --> 03:06:53,600
then the other of like
 

11423
03:06:53,600 --> 03:06:57,110
then the other of like
okay if there's if it's about complexity

11424
03:06:57,110 --> 03:06:57,120
okay if there's if it's about complexity
 

11425
03:06:57,120 --> 03:06:58,070
okay if there's if it's about complexity
then we should then

11426
03:06:58,070 --> 03:06:58,080
then we should then
 

11427
03:06:58,080 --> 03:07:00,070
then we should then
it exists at a certain level in these

11428
03:07:00,070 --> 03:07:00,080
it exists at a certain level in these
 

11429
03:07:00,080 --> 03:07:02,469
it exists at a certain level in these
simple systems like a star

11430
03:07:02,469 --> 03:07:02,479
simple systems like a star
 

11431
03:07:02,479 --> 03:07:04,550
simple systems like a star
or or uh you know they all have more

11432
03:07:04,550 --> 03:07:04,560
or or uh you know they all have more
 

11433
03:07:04,560 --> 03:07:05,510
or or uh you know they all have more
complex

11434
03:07:05,510 --> 03:07:05,520
complex
 

11435
03:07:05,520 --> 03:07:08,309
complex
psychism that's right but we humans uh

11436
03:07:08,309 --> 03:07:08,319
psychism that's right but we humans uh
 

11437
03:07:08,319 --> 03:07:09,670
psychism that's right but we humans uh
the qualitative shift

11438
03:07:09,670 --> 03:07:09,680
the qualitative shift
 

11439
03:07:09,680 --> 03:07:12,710
the qualitative shift
we might have evolved to appreciate

11440
03:07:12,710 --> 03:07:12,720
we might have evolved to appreciate
 

11441
03:07:12,720 --> 03:07:14,309
we might have evolved to appreciate
certain kinds of thresholds

11442
03:07:14,309 --> 03:07:14,319
certain kinds of thresholds
 

11443
03:07:14,319 --> 03:07:17,190
certain kinds of thresholds
right yeah i do think it's likely that

11444
03:07:17,190 --> 03:07:17,200
right yeah i do think it's likely that
 

11445
03:07:17,200 --> 03:07:18,309
right yeah i do think it's likely that
this idea that

11446
03:07:18,309 --> 03:07:18,319
this idea that
 

11447
03:07:18,319 --> 03:07:19,429
this idea that
whether or not there's an inner

11448
03:07:19,429 --> 03:07:19,439
whether or not there's an inner
 

11449
03:07:19,439 --> 03:07:21,269
whether or not there's an inner
experience which is phenomenal it's the

11450
03:07:21,269 --> 03:07:21,279
experience which is phenomenal it's the
 

11451
03:07:21,279 --> 03:07:22,230
experience which is phenomenal it's the
hard problem

11452
03:07:22,230 --> 03:07:22,240
hard problem
 

11453
03:07:22,240 --> 03:07:25,269
hard problem
that acting like an agent

11454
03:07:25,269 --> 03:07:25,279
that acting like an agent
 

11455
03:07:25,279 --> 03:07:27,030
that acting like an agent
like having an algorithm that basically

11456
03:07:27,030 --> 03:07:27,040
like having an algorithm that basically
 

11457
03:07:27,040 --> 03:07:29,429
like having an algorithm that basically
like operates as if there is an agent

11458
03:07:29,429 --> 03:07:29,439
like operates as if there is an agent
 

11459
03:07:29,439 --> 03:07:31,670
like operates as if there is an agent
that's clearly a thing that i think has

11460
03:07:31,670 --> 03:07:31,680
that's clearly a thing that i think has
 

11461
03:07:31,680 --> 03:07:32,710
that's clearly a thing that i think has
worked

11462
03:07:32,710 --> 03:07:32,720
worked
 

11463
03:07:32,720 --> 03:07:34,950
worked
and that there is a whole lot to figure

11464
03:07:34,950 --> 03:07:34,960
and that there is a whole lot to figure
 

11465
03:07:34,960 --> 03:07:35,750
and that there is a whole lot to figure
out there

11466
03:07:35,750 --> 03:07:35,760
out there
 

11467
03:07:35,760 --> 03:07:38,150
out there
that that um and i think psychedelics

11468
03:07:38,150 --> 03:07:38,160
that that um and i think psychedelics
 

11469
03:07:38,160 --> 03:07:39,670
that that um and i think psychedelics
will be extremely

11470
03:07:39,670 --> 03:07:39,680
will be extremely
 

11471
03:07:39,680 --> 03:07:43,030
will be extremely
helpful in figuring more out about that

11472
03:07:43,030 --> 03:07:43,040
helpful in figuring more out about that
 

11473
03:07:43,040 --> 03:07:44,950
helpful in figuring more out about that
because they do seem to

11474
03:07:44,950 --> 03:07:44,960
because they do seem to
 

11475
03:07:44,960 --> 03:07:47,429
because they do seem to
a lot of times eliminate that or

11476
03:07:47,429 --> 03:07:47,439
a lot of times eliminate that or
 

11477
03:07:47,439 --> 03:07:49,830
a lot of times eliminate that or
whatever radically shift that sense of

11478
03:07:49,830 --> 03:07:49,840
whatever radically shift that sense of
 

11479
03:07:49,840 --> 03:07:53,269
whatever radically shift that sense of
of self let me ask the craziest question

11480
03:07:53,269 --> 03:07:53,279
of self let me ask the craziest question
 

11481
03:07:53,279 --> 03:07:56,389
of self let me ask the craziest question
indulge me for a second oh uh

11482
03:07:56,389 --> 03:07:56,399
indulge me for a second oh uh
 

11483
03:07:56,399 --> 03:07:57,830
indulge me for a second oh uh
this is a joke look at what we've been

11484
03:07:57,830 --> 03:07:57,840
this is a joke look at what we've been
 

11485
03:07:57,840 --> 03:07:59,910
this is a joke look at what we've been
talking about like okay no all the

11486
03:07:59,910 --> 03:07:59,920
talking about like okay no all the
 

11487
03:07:59,920 --> 03:08:00,630
talking about like okay no all the

all of this is assigned all of that

03:08:03,030 --> 03:08:03,040
all of this is assigned all of that
 

11491
03:08:03,040 --> 03:08:04,150
all of this is assigned all of that
despite the

despite the
 

11493
03:08:04,160 --> 03:08:06,309
despite the
the caveats about armchair i think is

11494
03:08:06,309 --> 03:08:06,319
the caveats about armchair i think is
 

11495
03:08:06,319 --> 03:08:08,230
the caveats about armchair i think is
within the reach of science

11496
03:08:08,230 --> 03:08:08,240
within the reach of science
 

11497
03:08:08,240 --> 03:08:10,469
within the reach of science
uh let me let me ask one that's kind of

11498
03:08:10,469 --> 03:08:10,479
uh let me let me ask one that's kind of
 

11499

uh let me let me ask one that's kind of
um also with the nursing science but

03:08:14,550 --> 03:08:14,560
as joe likes to say uh it's entirely
 

11503
03:08:14,560 --> 03:08:15,990
as joe likes to say uh it's entirely
possible right

11504
03:08:15,990 --> 03:08:16,000
possible right
 

11505
03:08:16,000 --> 03:08:19,110
possible right
uh is it possible

11506
03:08:19,110 --> 03:08:19,120
uh is it possible
 

11507
03:08:19,120 --> 03:08:21,670
uh is it possible
that uh with these dmt trips when you

11508
03:08:21,670 --> 03:08:21,680
that uh with these dmt trips when you
 

11509
03:08:21,680 --> 03:08:23,750
that uh with these dmt trips when you
meet entities

11510
03:08:23,750 --> 03:08:23,760
meet entities
 

11511
03:08:23,760 --> 03:08:27,550
meet entities
is it possible that these entities are

11512
03:08:27,550 --> 03:08:27,560
is it possible that these entities are
 

11513
03:08:27,560 --> 03:08:30,710
is it possible that these entities are
extraterrestrial life forms

11514
03:08:30,710 --> 03:08:30,720
extraterrestrial life forms
 

11515
03:08:30,720 --> 03:08:32,790
extraterrestrial life forms
like our understanding of little green

11516
03:08:32,790 --> 03:08:32,800
like our understanding of little green

03:08:37,510 --> 03:08:37,520
is totally off i often think about this
 

11521
03:08:37,520 --> 03:08:37,830

like

11522
03:08:37,830 --> 03:08:37,840
like
 

11523
03:08:37,840 --> 03:08:40,550
like
what would actual extraterrestrial

11524
03:08:40,550 --> 03:08:40,560
what would actual extraterrestrial

11527
03:08:42,160 --> 03:08:45,750
intelligence
look like and my sense is it will look

11528
03:08:45,750 --> 03:08:45,760
look like and my sense is it will look
 

11529
03:08:45,760 --> 03:08:46,469
look like and my sense is it will look
like

03:08:49,760 --> 03:08:51,910
very different from anything we can even
begin to comprehend and how would it

11534
03:08:51,910 --> 03:08:51,920
begin to comprehend and how would it
 

11535
03:08:51,920 --> 03:08:53,670

would it be necessarily spaceships

03:08:55,359 --> 03:08:57,349
would it be necessarily spaceships
right travel or could it be

03:08:57,349 --> 03:08:57,359
right travel or could it be
 

11541
03:08:57,359 --> 03:08:59,030
right travel or could it be

for sure no we don't understand you know

11550
03:09:09,030 --> 03:09:09,040
for sure no we don't understand you know
 

11551
03:09:09,040 --> 03:09:11,269
for sure no we don't understand you know
a lot about the function of our mind

11552
03:09:11,269 --> 03:09:11,279
a lot about the function of our mind
 

11553
03:09:11,279 --> 03:09:14,870
a lot about the function of our mind
in connection to the fabric of uh

11554
03:09:14,870 --> 03:09:14,880
in connection to the fabric of uh
 

11555
03:09:14,880 --> 03:09:16,389
in connection to the fabric of uh
the physics of the universe a lot of

11556
03:09:16,389 --> 03:09:16,399
the physics of the universe a lot of
 

11557
03:09:16,399 --> 03:09:18,070
the physics of the universe a lot of
people seem to think we have theoretical

11558
03:09:18,070 --> 03:09:18,080
people seem to think we have theoretical
 

11559
03:09:18,080 --> 03:09:19,910
people seem to think we have theoretical
physics pretty figured out

11560
03:09:19,910 --> 03:09:19,920
physics pretty figured out
 

11561
03:09:19,920 --> 03:09:22,550
physics pretty figured out
i have my doubts because i'm pretty sure

11562
03:09:22,550 --> 03:09:22,560
i have my doubts because i'm pretty sure
 

11563
03:09:22,560 --> 03:09:23,990
i have my doubts because i'm pretty sure
it always feels like we have everything

11564
03:09:23,990 --> 03:09:24,000
it always feels like we have everything
 

11565
03:09:24,000 --> 03:09:25,510
it always feels like we have everything
figured out until we don't

11566
03:09:25,510 --> 03:09:25,520
figured out until we don't
 

11567
03:09:25,520 --> 03:09:26,950
figured out until we don't
right but i mean there's no grand

11568
03:09:26,950 --> 03:09:26,960
right but i mean there's no grand
 

11569
03:09:26,960 --> 03:09:29,429
right but i mean there's no grand
unifying theory yet right but even

11570
03:09:29,429 --> 03:09:29,439
unifying theory yet right but even
 

11571
03:09:29,439 --> 03:09:31,349
unifying theory yet right but even
widely recognized we could be missing

11572
03:09:31,349 --> 03:09:31,359
widely recognized we could be missing
 

11573
03:09:31,359 --> 03:09:33,990
widely recognized we could be missing
out like the concept of the universe

11574
03:09:33,990 --> 03:09:34,000
out like the concept of the universe
 

11575
03:09:34,000 --> 03:09:35,910
out like the concept of the universe
just can be completely off

11576
03:09:35,910 --> 03:09:35,920
just can be completely off
 

11577
03:09:35,920 --> 03:09:38,550
just can be completely off
like how many other universes are there

11578
03:09:38,550 --> 03:09:38,560
like how many other universes are there
 

11579
03:09:38,560 --> 03:09:39,429
like how many other universes are there
all those

11580
03:09:39,429 --> 03:09:39,439
all those
 

11581
03:09:39,439 --> 03:09:41,510
all those
all those kinds of things i mean just

11582
03:09:41,510 --> 03:09:41,520
all those kinds of things i mean just
 

11583
03:09:41,520 --> 03:09:44,870
all those kinds of things i mean just
the the basic nature of information the

11584
03:09:44,870 --> 03:09:44,880
the the basic nature of information the
 

11585
03:09:44,880 --> 03:09:48,229
the the basic nature of information the
uh time time all of those things yeah

11586
03:09:48,229 --> 03:09:48,239
uh time time all of those things yeah
 

11587
03:09:48,239 --> 03:09:49,990
uh time time all of those things yeah
well yeah what yeah whether that's just

11588
03:09:49,990 --> 03:09:50,000
well yeah what yeah whether that's just
 

11589
03:09:50,000 --> 03:09:52,309
well yeah what yeah whether that's just
like a thing we assign value to or that

11590
03:09:52,309 --> 03:09:52,319
like a thing we assign value to or that
 

11591
03:09:52,319 --> 03:09:53,990
like a thing we assign value to or that
whether it's fundamental or not that's

11592
03:09:53,990 --> 03:09:54,000
whether it's fundamental or not that's
 

11593
03:09:54,000 --> 03:09:55,990
whether it's fundamental or not that's
whole shank

11594
03:09:55,990 --> 03:09:56,000
whole shank
 

11595
03:09:56,000 --> 03:09:57,429
whole shank
i could talk to chunkier forever about

11596
03:09:57,429 --> 03:09:57,439
i could talk to chunkier forever about
 

11597
03:09:57,439 --> 03:09:59,349
i could talk to chunkier forever about
whether time is emergent or fundamental

11598
03:09:59,349 --> 03:09:59,359
whether time is emergent or fundamental
 

11599
03:09:59,359 --> 03:10:01,030
whether time is emergent or fundamental
to the reality

11600
03:10:01,030 --> 03:10:01,040
to the reality
 

11601
03:10:01,040 --> 03:10:03,830
to the reality
but is it possible that the entities we

11602
03:10:03,830 --> 03:10:03,840
but is it possible that the entities we
 

11603
03:10:03,840 --> 03:10:04,150
but is it possible that the entities we
meet

11604
03:10:04,150 --> 03:10:04,160
meet
 

11605
03:10:04,160 --> 03:10:06,870
meet
are actual alien life forms do you ever

11606
03:10:06,870 --> 03:10:06,880
are actual alien life forms do you ever
 

11607
03:10:06,880 --> 03:10:08,070
are actual alien life forms do you ever
think about that

11608
03:10:08,070 --> 03:10:08,080
think about that
 

11609
03:10:08,080 --> 03:10:11,269
think about that
yeah yeah yeah yeah i do and and i've

11610
03:10:11,269 --> 03:10:11,279
yeah yeah yeah yeah i do and and i've
 

11611
03:10:11,279 --> 03:10:13,429
yeah yeah yeah yeah i do and and i've
to somebody relayed my cards out with by

11612
03:10:13,429 --> 03:10:13,439
to somebody relayed my cards out with by
 

11613
03:10:13,439 --> 03:10:15,590
to somebody relayed my cards out with by
identifying as a radical empiricist

11614
03:10:15,590 --> 03:10:15,600
identifying as a radical empiricist
 

11615
03:10:15,600 --> 03:10:17,750
identifying as a radical empiricist
you know it's like so the answer is it

11616
03:10:17,750 --> 03:10:17,760
you know it's like so the answer is it
 

11617
03:10:17,760 --> 03:10:19,830
you know it's like so the answer is it
possible and i think you know ultimately

11618
03:10:19,830 --> 03:10:19,840
possible and i think you know ultimately
 

11619
03:10:19,840 --> 03:10:20,229
possible and i think you know ultimately
if

11620

if
 

11621
03:10:20,239 --> 03:10:21,750

if you're a good scientist you got to
 

11623
03:10:21,760 --> 03:10:24,710
if you're a good scientist you got to
say now that's at the extremes it's a

say now that's at the extremes it's a
like yes yes you know and it might get

11626
03:10:26,790 --> 03:10:26,800
like yes yes you know and it might get
 

11627
03:10:26,800 --> 03:10:28,710
like yes yes you know and it might get
more interesting when you had to

11628
03:10:28,710 --> 03:10:28,720
more interesting when you had to
 

11629
03:10:28,720 --> 03:10:30,229
more interesting when you had to
you you're asked to guess about the

11630
03:10:30,229 --> 03:10:30,239
you you're asked to guess about the
 

11631
03:10:30,239 --> 03:10:32,790
you you're asked to guess about the
probability of that is that a one in a

11632
03:10:32,790 --> 03:10:32,800
probability of that is that a one in a
 

11633
03:10:32,800 --> 03:10:34,469
probability of that is that a one in a
one in a million one in a trillion one

11634
03:10:34,469 --> 03:10:34,479
one in a million one in a trillion one
 

11635
03:10:34,479 --> 03:10:36,150
one in a million one in a trillion one
in a one in uh

03:10:36,160 --> 03:10:38,309
in a one in uh
more than the number of atoms in the

universe uh probability
and this one empiricist is like what

11642
03:10:42,790 --> 03:10:42,800
and this one empiricist is like what
 

11643
03:10:42,800 --> 03:10:44,309
and this one empiricist is like what
what is a good testable

11644
03:10:44,309 --> 03:10:44,319
what is a good testable
 

11645
03:10:44,319 --> 03:10:45,670
what is a good testable
like how would you know the answer to

11646
03:10:45,670 --> 03:10:45,680
like how would you know the answer to
 

11647
03:10:45,680 --> 03:10:47,750
like how would you know the answer to
that question well how would you be able

11648
03:10:47,750 --> 03:10:47,760
that question well how would you be able
 

11649
03:10:47,760 --> 03:10:49,190
that question well how would you be able
to validate it

11650
03:10:49,190 --> 03:10:49,200
to validate it
 

11651
03:10:49,200 --> 03:10:51,269
to validate it
i mean well can you get some information

11652
03:10:51,269 --> 03:10:51,279
i mean well can you get some information
 

11653
03:10:51,279 --> 03:10:52,710
i mean well can you get some information
that's verifiable like

11654
03:10:52,710 --> 03:10:52,720
that's verifiable like
 

11655
03:10:52,720 --> 03:10:56,870
that's verifiable like
like um information that about some

11656
03:10:56,870 --> 03:10:56,880
like um information that about some
 

11657
03:10:56,880 --> 03:10:59,990
like um information that about some
other planet that that or some aspect

11658
03:10:59,990 --> 03:11:00,000
other planet that that or some aspect
 

11659
03:11:00,000 --> 03:11:02,950
other planet that that or some aspect
some and gosh it would be an interesting

11660
03:11:02,950 --> 03:11:02,960
some and gosh it would be an interesting
 

11661
03:11:02,960 --> 03:11:05,349
some and gosh it would be an interesting
range but what range of discovery that

11662
03:11:05,349 --> 03:11:05,359
range but what range of discovery that
 

11663
03:11:05,359 --> 03:11:06,870
range but what range of discovery that
we can anticipate we're gonna know

11664
03:11:06,870 --> 03:11:06,880
we can anticipate we're gonna know
 

11665
03:11:06,880 --> 03:11:08,070
we can anticipate we're gonna know
within

03:11:08,070 --> 03:11:08,080
within
 

11667
03:11:08,080 --> 03:11:11,269
within
um you know whatever a few years next

11668
03:11:11,269 --> 03:11:11,279
um you know whatever a few years next
 

11669
03:11:11,279 --> 03:11:14,070
um you know whatever a few years next
five ten twenty years um and seeing if

11670
03:11:14,070 --> 03:11:14,080
five ten twenty years um and seeing if
 

11671
03:11:14,080 --> 03:11:15,349
five ten twenty years um and seeing if
you can get that predict

11672
03:11:15,349 --> 03:11:15,359
you can get that predict
 

11673
03:11:15,359 --> 03:11:18,389
you can get that predict
that information now and then over time

11674
03:11:18,389 --> 03:11:18,399
that information now and then over time
 

11675
03:11:18,399 --> 03:11:19,990
that information now and then over time
it might be verified

11676
03:11:19,990 --> 03:11:20,000
it might be verified
 

11677
03:11:20,000 --> 03:11:21,990
it might be verified
you know the type of thing like you know

11678
03:11:21,990 --> 03:11:22,000
you know the type of thing like you know
 

11679
03:11:22,000 --> 03:11:23,190
you know the type of thing like you know
part of einstein's

11680
03:11:23,190 --> 03:11:23,200
part of einstein's
 

11681
03:11:23,200 --> 03:11:25,110
part of einstein's
work was ultimately verified not until

11682
03:11:25,110 --> 03:11:25,120
work was ultimately verified not until
 

11683
03:11:25,120 --> 03:11:26,550
work was ultimately verified not until
decades and decades later at least

11684
03:11:26,550 --> 03:11:26,560
decades and decades later at least
 

11685

um through empirical observations um but
 

11689
03:11:31,439 --> 03:11:33,349
um through empirical observations um but
but it's also possible that the the

11690
03:11:33,349 --> 03:11:33,359
but it's also possible that the the
 

11691
03:11:33,359 --> 03:11:34,469
but it's also possible that the the
alien beings

11692
03:11:34,469 --> 03:11:34,479
alien beings
 

11693
03:11:34,479 --> 03:11:36,469
alien beings
have a very different value system and

11694
03:11:36,469 --> 03:11:36,479
have a very different value system and
 

11695
03:11:36,479 --> 03:11:38,150
have a very different value system and
perception of the world where all of

03:11:38,710 --> 03:11:38,720
this
 

11699
03:11:38,720 --> 03:11:40,469
this
little capitalistic improvements that

11700
03:11:40,469 --> 03:11:40,479
little capitalistic improvements that
 

11701
03:11:40,479 --> 03:11:41,830
little capitalistic improvements that
we're all after like

11702
03:11:41,830 --> 03:11:41,840
we're all after like
 

11703
03:11:41,840 --> 03:11:43,990
we're all after like
predicting the concept of predicting the

11704
03:11:43,990 --> 03:11:44,000
predicting the concept of predicting the
 

11705
03:11:44,000 --> 03:11:45,269
predicting the concept of predicting the
future too

11706
03:11:45,269 --> 03:11:45,279
future too
 

11707
03:11:45,279 --> 03:11:48,550
future too
is like totally useless to

11708
03:11:48,550 --> 03:11:48,560
is like totally useless to
 

11709
03:11:48,560 --> 03:11:51,830
is like totally useless to
to other life forms uh that have

11710
03:11:51,830 --> 03:11:51,840
to other life forms uh that have
 

11711
03:11:51,840 --> 03:11:55,349
to other life forms uh that have
that perhaps think in a much

11712
03:11:55,349 --> 03:11:55,359
that perhaps think in a much
 

11713
03:11:55,359 --> 03:11:57,590
that perhaps think in a much
different way maybe a more transcendent

11714
03:11:57,590 --> 03:11:57,600
different way maybe a more transcendent
 

11715
03:11:57,600 --> 03:11:58,790
different way maybe a more transcendent
way i don't know but

11716
03:11:58,790 --> 03:11:58,800
way i don't know but
 

11717
03:11:58,800 --> 03:12:00,229
way i don't know but
so they wouldn't even sign the consent

11718
03:12:00,229 --> 03:12:00,239
so they wouldn't even sign the consent
 

11719
03:12:00,239 --> 03:12:05,670
so they wouldn't even sign the consent
form to be a participant in our

11720
03:12:05,670 --> 03:12:05,680
form to be a participant in our
 

11721
03:12:05,680 --> 03:12:07,190
form to be a participant in our
and they wouldn't understand the nature

11722
03:12:07,190 --> 03:12:07,200
and they wouldn't understand the nature
 

11723
03:12:07,200 --> 03:12:08,710
and they wouldn't understand the nature
of these experiments i mean that

11724
03:12:08,710 --> 03:12:08,720
of these experiments i mean that
 

11725
03:12:08,720 --> 03:12:12,229
of these experiments i mean that
um maybe it's purely in the realm of

11726
03:12:12,229 --> 03:12:12,239
um maybe it's purely in the realm of
 

11727
03:12:12,239 --> 03:12:15,349
um maybe it's purely in the realm of
uh the the consciousness the thing that

11728
03:12:15,349 --> 03:12:15,359
uh the the consciousness the thing that
 

11729
03:12:15,359 --> 03:12:18,229
uh the the consciousness the thing that
we uh talked about so communicating in

11730
03:12:18,229 --> 03:12:18,239
we uh talked about so communicating in
 

11731
03:12:18,239 --> 03:12:19,429
we uh talked about so communicating in
in a way that

11732
03:12:19,429 --> 03:12:19,439
in a way that
 

11733
03:12:19,439 --> 03:12:21,429
in a way that
is totally different than the kinds of

11734
03:12:21,429 --> 03:12:21,439
is totally different than the kinds of
 

11735
03:12:21,439 --> 03:12:23,030
is totally different than the kinds of
communication that we think of

11736
03:12:23,030 --> 03:12:23,040
communication that we think of
 

11737
03:12:23,040 --> 03:12:25,990
communication that we think of
as on earth like what's the purpose of

11738
03:12:25,990 --> 03:12:26,000
as on earth like what's the purpose of
 

11739
03:12:26,000 --> 03:12:27,750
as on earth like what's the purpose of
communication for us

11740
03:12:27,750 --> 03:12:27,760
communication for us
 

11741
03:12:27,760 --> 03:12:29,510
communication for us
for us humans the purpose of

11742
03:12:29,510 --> 03:12:29,520
for us humans the purpose of
 

11743
03:12:29,520 --> 03:12:31,429
for us humans the purpose of
communication is sharing ideas

11744
03:12:31,429 --> 03:12:31,439
communication is sharing ideas
 

11745
03:12:31,439 --> 03:12:34,790
communication is sharing ideas
it feels like like converging

11746
03:12:34,790 --> 03:12:34,800
it feels like like converging
 

11747
03:12:34,800 --> 03:12:37,910
it feels like like converging
like it's the dawkins like memes it's

11748
03:12:37,910 --> 03:12:37,920
like it's the dawkins like memes it's
 

11749
03:12:37,920 --> 03:12:38,229
like it's the dawkins like memes it's
like

11750
03:12:38,229 --> 03:12:38,239
like
 

11751
03:12:38,239 --> 03:12:41,110
like
we're sharing ideas in order to figure

11752
03:12:41,110 --> 03:12:41,120
we're sharing ideas in order to figure
 

11753
03:12:41,120 --> 03:12:41,510
we're sharing ideas in order to figure
out

11754
03:12:41,510 --> 03:12:41,520
out
 

11755
03:12:41,520 --> 03:12:44,309
out
how to uh collaborate together to get

11756
03:12:44,309 --> 03:12:44,319
how to uh collaborate together to get
 

11757
03:12:44,319 --> 03:12:46,389
how to uh collaborate together to get
food into our systems and

11758
03:12:46,389 --> 03:12:46,399
food into our systems and
 

11759
03:12:46,399 --> 03:12:48,950
food into our systems and
procreate and then like murder everybody

11760
03:12:48,950 --> 03:12:48,960
procreate and then like murder everybody
 

11761
03:12:48,960 --> 03:12:50,550
procreate and then like murder everybody
in the neighboring tribe

11762
03:12:50,550 --> 03:12:50,560
in the neighboring tribe
 

11763
03:12:50,560 --> 03:12:52,950
in the neighboring tribe
because they they'll steal our food like

11764
03:12:52,950 --> 03:12:52,960
because they they'll steal our food like
 

11765
03:12:52,960 --> 03:12:54,870
because they they'll steal our food like
we are all about sharing ideas

11766
03:12:54,870 --> 03:12:54,880
we are all about sharing ideas
 

11767
03:12:54,880 --> 03:12:58,229
we are all about sharing ideas
maybe uh it's possible to to have

11768
03:12:58,229 --> 03:12:58,239
maybe uh it's possible to to have
 

11769
03:12:58,239 --> 03:12:59,990
maybe uh it's possible to to have
another alien life form that's

11770
03:12:59,990 --> 03:13:00,000
another alien life form that's
 

11771
03:13:00,000 --> 03:13:03,269
another alien life form that's
more about sharing experiences you know

11772
03:13:03,269 --> 03:13:03,279
more about sharing experiences you know
 

11773
03:13:03,279 --> 03:13:05,830
more about sharing experiences you know
like it's less about ideas i don't know

11774
03:13:05,830 --> 03:13:05,840
like it's less about ideas i don't know
 

11775
03:13:05,840 --> 03:13:07,590
like it's less about ideas i don't know
and maybe that'll be us in a few years

11776
03:13:07,590 --> 03:13:07,600
and maybe that'll be us in a few years
 

11777
03:13:07,600 --> 03:13:08,710
and maybe that'll be us in a few years
yeah how could it not like

11778
03:13:08,710 --> 03:13:08,720
yeah how could it not like
 

11779
03:13:08,720 --> 03:13:09,830
yeah how could it not like
instead of explaining something

11780
03:13:09,830 --> 03:13:09,840
instead of explaining something
 

11781
03:13:09,840 --> 03:13:12,389
instead of explaining something
laboriously to you like having people

11782
03:13:12,389 --> 03:13:12,399
laboriously to you like having people
 

11783
03:13:12,399 --> 03:13:14,150
laboriously to you like having people
describe the ineffable psychedelic

11784
03:13:14,150 --> 03:13:14,160
describe the ineffable psychedelic
 

11785
03:13:14,160 --> 03:13:15,750
describe the ineffable psychedelic
experience like if we could

11786
03:13:15,750 --> 03:13:15,760
experience like if we could
 

11787
03:13:15,760 --> 03:13:18,389
experience like if we could
record that and then get the near a link

11788
03:13:18,389 --> 03:13:18,399
record that and then get the near a link
 

11789
03:13:18,399 --> 03:13:18,870
record that and then get the near a link
of

11790
03:13:18,870 --> 03:13:18,880
of
 

11791
03:13:18,880 --> 03:13:20,870
of
50 years from now like oh just plug this

50 years from now like oh just plug this
 

11793
03:13:20,880 --> 03:13:22,469
50 years from now like oh just plug this
into your just transferring these yeah

11794
03:13:22,469 --> 03:13:22,479
into your just transferring these yeah
 

11795
03:13:22,479 --> 03:13:24,070
into your just transferring these yeah
it's like oh now you feel what it's

what it's like and like in one sense
like how could we not go there and then

11800
03:13:27,670 --> 03:13:27,680
like how could we not go there and then
 

11801
03:13:27,680 --> 03:13:27,990
like how could we not go there and then
you get

11802
03:13:27,990 --> 03:13:28,000
you get
 

11803
03:13:28,000 --> 03:13:29,110
you get
into the realm of especially when you

11804
03:13:29,110 --> 03:13:29,120
into the realm of especially when you
 

11805
03:13:29,120 --> 03:13:31,429
into the realm of especially when you
throw time into it are the aliens us

11806
03:13:31,429 --> 03:13:31,439
throw time into it are the aliens us
 

11807
03:13:31,439 --> 03:13:33,190
throw time into it are the aliens us
yeah in the future or even like a

11808
03:13:33,190 --> 03:13:33,200
yeah in the future or even like a
 

11809
03:13:33,200 --> 03:13:35,269
yeah in the future or even like a
transcendental temporal

11810
03:13:35,269 --> 03:13:35,279
transcendental temporal
 

11811
03:13:35,279 --> 03:13:37,830
transcendental temporal
like the us beyond time like i don't

11812
03:13:37,830 --> 03:13:37,840
like the us beyond time like i don't
 

11813
03:13:37,840 --> 03:13:39,349
like the us beyond time like i don't
know like you get into this world

but i think you know there's one
 

11819
03:13:43,920 --> 03:13:45,510
but i think you know there's one
psychedelic researcher that's who did

11820
03:13:45,510 --> 03:13:45,520
psychedelic researcher that's who did
 

11821
03:13:45,520 --> 03:13:47,110
psychedelic researcher that's who did
high-dose dmt

11822
03:13:47,110 --> 03:13:47,120
high-dose dmt
 

11823
03:13:47,120 --> 03:13:50,150
high-dose dmt
um research in the 90s who speculated

11824
03:13:50,150 --> 03:13:50,160
um research in the 90s who speculated
 

11825
03:13:50,160 --> 03:13:50,710
um research in the 90s who speculated
that

11826
03:13:50,710 --> 03:13:50,720
that
 

11827
03:13:50,720 --> 03:13:53,030
that
um that and there was a lot of alien

11828
03:13:53,030 --> 03:13:53,040
um that and there was a lot of alien
 

11829
03:13:53,040 --> 03:13:54,830
um that and there was a lot of alien
encounter experiences like maybe these

11830
03:13:54,830 --> 03:13:54,840
encounter experiences like maybe these
 

11831
03:13:54,840 --> 03:13:56,070
encounter experiences like maybe these
are

11832
03:13:56,070 --> 03:13:56,080
are
 

11833
03:13:56,080 --> 03:13:58,710
are
like entities from some other dimension

11834
03:13:58,710 --> 03:13:58,720
like entities from some other dimension
 

11835
03:13:58,720 --> 03:13:59,349
like entities from some other dimension
or

11836
03:13:59,349 --> 03:13:59,359
or
 

11837
03:13:59,359 --> 03:14:01,590
or
he labeled it as speculation but you

11838
03:14:01,590 --> 03:14:01,600
he labeled it as speculation but you
 

11839
03:14:01,600 --> 03:14:03,510
he labeled it as speculation but you
know do you remember the name

11840
03:14:03,510 --> 03:14:03,520
know do you remember the name
 

11841
03:14:03,520 --> 03:14:06,309
know do you remember the name
oh rick straussman who did yeah yeah the

11842

oh rick straussman who did yeah yeah the
 

11843
03:14:06,319 --> 03:14:07,510
oh rick straussman who did yeah yeah the
the dmt work

11844
03:14:07,510 --> 03:14:07,520
the dmt work
 

11845
03:14:07,520 --> 03:14:10,550
the dmt work
he labeled it as speculation but you

11846
03:14:10,550 --> 03:14:10,560
he labeled it as speculation but you
 

11847
03:14:10,560 --> 03:14:13,590
he labeled it as speculation but you
know i think that

11848
03:14:13,590 --> 03:14:13,600

 

11849
03:14:13,600 --> 03:14:16,389

yeah i think we'd be wise to kind of you

11850
03:14:16,389 --> 03:14:16,399
yeah i think we'd be wise to kind of you
 

11851
03:14:16,399 --> 03:14:18,070
yeah i think we'd be wise to kind of you
know find it's always that balance

11852
03:14:18,070 --> 03:14:18,080
know find it's always that balance
 

11853
03:14:18,080 --> 03:14:19,990
know find it's always that balance
between

11854
03:14:19,990 --> 03:14:20,000
between
 

11855
03:14:20,000 --> 03:14:22,630
between
being empirically grounded and skeptical

11856
03:14:22,630 --> 03:14:22,640
being empirically grounded and skeptical
 

11857
03:14:22,640 --> 03:14:24,070
being empirically grounded and skeptical
but also not being and i think in

11858
03:14:24,070 --> 03:14:24,080
but also not being and i think in
 

11859
03:14:24,080 --> 03:14:26,229
but also not being and i think in
science well often we are

11860
03:14:26,229 --> 03:14:26,239
science well often we are
 

11861
03:14:26,239 --> 03:14:28,469
science well often we are
too closed yeah which relates to like

11862
03:14:28,469 --> 03:14:28,479
too closed yeah which relates to like
 

11863
03:14:28,479 --> 03:14:30,229
too closed yeah which relates to like
you're talking about elon like

11864
03:14:30,229 --> 03:14:30,239
you're talking about elon like
 

11865
03:14:30,239 --> 03:14:31,990
you're talking about elon like
in academia it's like often like i think

11866
03:14:31,990 --> 03:14:32,000
in academia it's like often like i think
 

11867
03:14:32,000 --> 03:14:33,429
in academia it's like often like i think
you're punished for thinking or even

11868
03:14:33,429 --> 03:14:33,439
you're punished for thinking or even
 

11869
03:14:33,439 --> 03:14:35,190
you're punished for thinking or even
talking about 20 years from now because

11870
03:14:35,190 --> 03:14:35,200
talking about 20 years from now because
 

11871
03:14:35,200 --> 03:14:35,990
talking about 20 years from now because
it's just so

11872
03:14:35,990 --> 03:14:36,000
it's just so
 

11873
03:14:36,000 --> 03:14:37,590
it's just so
far removed from your next grant or for

11885
03:14:48,399 --> 03:14:49,110
i'm a huge fan of i think the the best
way

11886
03:14:49,110 --> 03:14:49,120
way
 

11887
03:14:49,120 --> 03:14:52,710
way
to me at least to practice like science

11888
03:14:52,710 --> 03:14:52,720
to me at least to practice like science
 

11889
03:14:52,720 --> 03:14:55,190
to me at least to practice like science
or to practice good engineering is to

11890
03:14:55,190 --> 03:14:55,200
or to practice good engineering is to
 

11891
03:14:55,200 --> 03:14:56,229
or to practice good engineering is to
like

11892
03:14:56,229 --> 03:14:56,239
like
 

11893
03:14:56,239 --> 03:14:59,030
like
do two things and just bounce off like

11894
03:14:59,030 --> 03:14:59,040
do two things and just bounce off like
 

11895
03:14:59,040 --> 03:15:00,309
do two things and just bounce off like
spend most of the time

11896
03:15:00,309 --> 03:15:00,319
spend most of the time
 

11897
03:15:00,319 --> 03:15:03,429
spend most of the time
doing the rigor of the day-to-day of

11898
03:15:03,429 --> 03:15:03,439
doing the rigor of the day-to-day of
 

11899
03:15:03,439 --> 03:15:04,710
doing the rigor of the day-to-day of
what can be accomplished now in the

11900
03:15:04,710 --> 03:15:04,720
what can be accomplished now in the
 

11901
03:15:04,720 --> 03:15:06,389
what can be accomplished now in the
engineering space or in the science like

11902
03:15:06,389 --> 03:15:06,399
engineering space or in the science like
 

11903
03:15:06,399 --> 03:15:07,030
engineering space or in the science like
what can

11904
03:15:07,030 --> 03:15:07,040
what can
 

11905
03:15:07,040 --> 03:15:08,870
what can
actually what can you construct an

11906
03:15:08,870 --> 03:15:08,880
actually what can you construct an
 

11907
03:15:08,880 --> 03:15:10,469
actually what can you construct an
experiment around

11908
03:15:10,469 --> 03:15:10,479
experiment around
 

11909
03:15:10,479 --> 03:15:12,550
experiment around
do like that the usual rigor of the

11910
03:15:12,550 --> 03:15:12,560
do like that the usual rigor of the
 

11911
03:15:12,560 --> 03:15:13,830
do like that the usual rigor of the
scientific process

11912
03:15:13,830 --> 03:15:13,840
scientific process
 

11913
03:15:13,840 --> 03:15:16,469
scientific process
but then every once in a while on a

11914
03:15:16,469 --> 03:15:16,479
but then every once in a while on a
 

11915
03:15:16,479 --> 03:15:18,790
but then every once in a while on a
regular basis to step outside and talk

11916
03:15:18,790 --> 03:15:18,800
regular basis to step outside and talk
 

11917
03:15:18,800 --> 03:15:20,229
regular basis to step outside and talk
about aliens

11918
03:15:20,229 --> 03:15:20,239
about aliens
 

11919
03:15:20,239 --> 03:15:23,910
about aliens
and consciousness and uh we just walk

11920
03:15:23,910 --> 03:15:23,920
and consciousness and uh we just walk
 

11921
03:15:23,920 --> 03:15:25,670
and consciousness and uh we just walk
along the line of things that are

11922
03:15:25,670 --> 03:15:25,680
along the line of things that are
 

11923
03:15:25,680 --> 03:15:27,830
along the line of things that are
outside the reach of science currently

11924
03:15:27,830 --> 03:15:27,840
outside the reach of science currently
 

11925
03:15:27,840 --> 03:15:31,269
outside the reach of science currently
uh free will the the

11926
03:15:31,269 --> 03:15:31,279
uh free will the the
 

11927
03:15:31,279 --> 03:15:33,750
uh free will the the
illusion the illusion or the perception

11928
03:15:33,750 --> 03:15:33,760
illusion the illusion or the perception
 

11929
03:15:33,760 --> 03:15:35,830
illusion the illusion or the perception
or the experience of free will

11930
03:15:35,830 --> 03:15:35,840
or the experience of free will
 

11931
03:15:35,840 --> 03:15:39,349
or the experience of free will
of anything just just the the entirety

11932
03:15:39,349 --> 03:15:39,359
of anything just just the the entirety
 

11933
03:15:39,359 --> 03:15:39,990
of anything just just the the entirety
of it

11934
03:15:39,990 --> 03:15:40,000
of it
 

11935
03:15:40,000 --> 03:15:41,750
of it
being able to travel in time through

11936
03:15:41,750 --> 03:15:41,760
being able to travel in time through
 

11937
03:15:41,760 --> 03:15:44,389
being able to travel in time through
warm holes it's like it's really useful

11938
03:15:44,389 --> 03:15:44,399
warm holes it's like it's really useful
 

11939
03:15:44,399 --> 03:15:45,349
warm holes it's like it's really useful
to do that

11940
03:15:45,349 --> 03:15:45,359
to do that
 

11941
03:15:45,359 --> 03:15:47,990
to do that
especially as a scientist like if that's

11942
03:15:47,990 --> 03:15:48,000
especially as a scientist like if that's
 

11943
03:15:48,000 --> 03:15:49,190
especially as a scientist like if that's
all you do

11944
03:15:49,190 --> 03:15:49,200
all you do
 

11945
03:15:49,200 --> 03:15:52,389
all you do
you go into a land where you're not

11946
03:15:52,389 --> 03:15:52,399
you go into a land where you're not
 

11947
03:15:52,399 --> 03:15:54,070
you go into a land where you're not
actually able to think rigorously

11948
03:15:54,070 --> 03:15:54,080
actually able to think rigorously
 

11949
03:15:54,080 --> 03:15:54,870
actually able to think rigorously
there's something

11950
03:15:54,870 --> 03:15:54,880
there's something
 

11951
03:15:54,880 --> 03:15:57,750
there's something
at least to me that if you just hop back

11952
03:15:57,750 --> 03:15:57,760
at least to me that if you just hop back
 

11953
03:15:57,760 --> 03:15:59,110
at least to me that if you just hop back
and forth

11954
03:15:59,110 --> 03:15:59,120
and forth
 

11955
03:15:59,120 --> 03:16:01,670
and forth
you're able to i think do exactly the

11956
03:16:01,670 --> 03:16:01,680
you're able to i think do exactly the
 

11957
03:16:01,680 --> 03:16:02,309
you're able to i think do exactly the
kind of

11958
03:16:02,309 --> 03:16:02,319
kind of
 

11959
03:16:02,319 --> 03:16:05,349
kind of
injection of out of the box

11960
03:16:05,349 --> 03:16:05,359
injection of out of the box
 

11961
03:16:05,359 --> 03:16:07,590
injection of out of the box
thinking to your regular day-to-day

11962
03:16:07,590 --> 03:16:07,600
thinking to your regular day-to-day
 

11963
03:16:07,600 --> 03:16:08,790
thinking to your regular day-to-day
science

11964
03:16:08,790 --> 03:16:08,800
science
 

11965
03:16:08,800 --> 03:16:10,469
science
that will ultimately lead to

11966
03:16:10,469 --> 03:16:10,479
that will ultimately lead to
 

11967
03:16:10,479 --> 03:16:11,910
that will ultimately lead to
breakthroughs

11968
03:16:11,910 --> 03:16:11,920
breakthroughs
 

11969
03:16:11,920 --> 03:16:13,750
breakthroughs
but you have to be the good scientist

11970
03:16:13,750 --> 03:16:13,760
but you have to be the good scientist
 

11971
03:16:13,760 --> 03:16:15,030
but you have to be the good scientist
most of the time

11972
03:16:15,030 --> 03:16:15,040
most of the time
 

11973
03:16:15,040 --> 03:16:16,950
most of the time
and that's consistent with what i think

11974
03:16:16,950 --> 03:16:16,960
and that's consistent with what i think
 

11975
03:16:16,960 --> 03:16:19,349
and that's consistent with what i think
the great scientists of history

11976
03:16:19,349 --> 03:16:19,359
the great scientists of history
 

11977
03:16:19,359 --> 03:16:22,790
the great scientists of history
like like in most of the

11978
03:16:22,790 --> 03:16:22,800
like like in most of the
 

11979
03:16:22,800 --> 03:16:24,950
like like in most of the
the history you know the greats you know

11980
03:16:24,950 --> 03:16:24,960
the history you know the greats you know
 

11981
03:16:24,960 --> 03:16:26,309
the history you know the greats you know
the newtons and

11982
03:16:26,309 --> 03:16:26,319
the newtons and
 

11983
03:16:26,319 --> 03:16:29,349
the newtons and
uh you know einsteins i mean they were

11984
03:16:29,349 --> 03:16:29,359
uh you know einsteins i mean they were
 

11985
03:16:29,359 --> 03:16:31,110
uh you know einsteins i mean they were
there was less of an in this change i

11986
03:16:31,110 --> 03:16:31,120
there was less of an in this change i
 

11987
03:16:31,120 --> 03:16:33,030
there was less of an in this change i
think as time marched on but less of a

11988
03:16:33,030 --> 03:16:33,040
think as time marched on but less of a
 

11989
03:16:33,040 --> 03:16:34,630
think as time marched on but less of a
separation between those realms

11990
03:16:34,630 --> 03:16:34,640
separation between those realms
 

11991
03:16:34,640 --> 03:16:36,790
separation between those realms
it's like there's the inclination alpha

11992
03:16:36,790 --> 03:16:36,800
it's like there's the inclination alpha
 

11993
03:16:36,800 --> 03:16:37,670
it's like there's the inclination alpha
it's like

11994
03:16:37,670 --> 03:16:37,680
it's like
 

11995
03:16:37,680 --> 03:16:40,790
it's like
as a scientist and this is like

11996
03:16:40,790 --> 03:16:40,800
as a scientist and this is like
 

11997
03:16:40,800 --> 03:16:42,469
as a scientist and this is like
you know this is science this is my work

11998
03:16:42,469 --> 03:16:42,479
you know this is science this is my work
 

11999
03:16:42,479 --> 03:16:43,990
you know this is science this is my work
and then this like my inclination

12000
03:16:43,990 --> 03:16:44,000
and then this like my inclination
 

12001
03:16:44,000 --> 03:16:45,830
and then this like my inclination
to say oh lex don't take me too

12002
03:16:45,830 --> 03:16:45,840
to say oh lex don't take me too
 

12003
03:16:45,840 --> 03:16:47,190
to say oh lex don't take me too
seriously because this is my arm chair

12004
03:16:47,190 --> 03:16:47,200
seriously because this is my arm chair
 

12005
03:16:47,200 --> 03:16:48,389
seriously because this is my arm chair
i'm not speaking as a scientist

12006
03:16:48,389 --> 03:16:48,399
i'm not speaking as a scientist
 

12007
03:16:48,399 --> 03:16:51,110
i'm not speaking as a scientist
i'm bending over backwards you say you

12008
03:16:51,110 --> 03:16:51,120
i'm bending over backwards you say you
 

12009
03:16:51,120 --> 03:16:51,510
i'm bending over backwards you say you
know

12010
03:16:51,510 --> 03:16:51,520
know
 

12011
03:16:51,520 --> 03:16:53,190
know
to divide that self and maybe there's

12012
03:16:53,190 --> 03:16:53,200
to divide that self and maybe there's
 

12013
03:16:53,200 --> 03:16:54,790
to divide that self and maybe there's
been less of there's been that

12014
03:16:54,790 --> 03:16:54,800
been less of there's been that
 

12015
03:16:54,800 --> 03:16:57,990
been less of there's been that
evolution and and that's and like the

12016
03:16:57,990 --> 03:16:58,000
evolution and and that's and like the
 

12017
03:16:58,000 --> 03:16:59,750
evolution and and that's and like the
greats like didn't

12018
03:16:59,750 --> 03:16:59,760
greats like didn't
 

12019
03:16:59,760 --> 03:17:01,670
greats like didn't
see that i mean newton and you go back

12020
03:17:01,670 --> 03:17:01,680
see that i mean newton and you go back
 

12021
03:17:01,680 --> 03:17:03,110
see that i mean newton and you go back
in time and it's like that obviously

12022
03:17:03,110 --> 03:17:03,120
in time and it's like that obviously
 

12023
03:17:03,120 --> 03:17:03,830
in time and it's like that obviously
like connects to

12024
03:17:03,830 --> 03:17:03,840
like connects to
 

12025
03:17:03,840 --> 03:17:05,110
like connects to
than religion especially that is the

12026
03:17:05,110 --> 03:17:05,120
than religion especially that is the
 

12027
03:17:05,120 --> 03:17:07,190
than religion especially that is the
predominant world where newton like how

12028
03:17:07,190 --> 03:17:07,200
predominant world where newton like how
 

12029
03:17:07,200 --> 03:17:08,469
predominant world where newton like how
much

12030
03:17:08,469 --> 03:17:08,479
much
 

12031
03:17:08,479 --> 03:17:10,229
much
you know like how much time did he spend

12032
03:17:10,229 --> 03:17:10,239
you know like how much time did he spend
 

12033
03:17:10,239 --> 03:17:11,830
you know like how much time did he spend
trying to like decode the bible and

12034
03:17:11,830 --> 03:17:11,840
trying to like decode the bible and
 

12035
03:17:11,840 --> 03:17:12,550
trying to like decode the bible and
whatnot you know

12036
03:17:12,550 --> 03:17:12,560
whatnot you know
 

12037
03:17:12,560 --> 03:17:14,710
whatnot you know
maybe that was a dead end but it's like

12038
03:17:14,710 --> 03:17:14,720
maybe that was a dead end but it's like
 

12039
03:17:14,720 --> 03:17:16,389
maybe that was a dead end but it's like
if if you really believe

12040
03:17:16,389 --> 03:17:16,399
if if you really believe
 

12041
03:17:16,399 --> 03:17:18,469
if if you really believe
in that in that particular religion and

12042
03:17:18,469 --> 03:17:18,479
in that in that particular religion and
 

12043
03:17:18,479 --> 03:17:20,070
in that in that particular religion and

no i've got this limited time on the

12054
03:17:28,070 --> 03:17:28,080
no i've got this limited time on the
 

12055
03:17:28,080 --> 03:17:29,349
no i've got this limited time on the
planet i'm going to figure out as much

12056
03:17:29,349 --> 03:17:29,359
planet i'm going to figure out as much
 

12057
03:17:29,359 --> 03:17:30,790
planet i'm going to figure out as much
stuff as possible

12058
03:17:30,790 --> 03:17:30,800
stuff as possible
 

12059
03:17:30,800 --> 03:17:32,790
stuff as possible
nothing is off the table and you're just

12060
03:17:32,790 --> 03:17:32,800
nothing is off the table and you're just
 

12061
03:17:32,800 --> 03:17:34,070
nothing is off the table and you're just
putting it all

12062
03:17:34,070 --> 03:17:34,080
putting it all
 

12063
03:17:34,080 --> 03:17:35,190
putting it all
together so this is kind of the

12064
03:17:35,190 --> 03:17:35,200
together so this is kind of the
 

12065
03:17:35,200 --> 03:17:37,110
together so this is kind of the
trajectories maybe related to this

12066
03:17:37,110 --> 03:17:37,120
trajectories maybe related to this
 

12067
03:17:37,120 --> 03:17:40,309
trajectories maybe related to this
the siloing in science like again

12068
03:17:40,309 --> 03:17:40,319
the siloing in science like again
 

12069
03:17:40,319 --> 03:17:41,830
the siloing in science like again
related to my like oh i'm not a

12070
03:17:41,830 --> 03:17:41,840
related to my like oh i'm not a

the rest of her life
 

12205
03:20:03,680 --> 03:20:05,910
the rest of her life
i'm concerned about not i'm concerned

12206
03:20:05,910 --> 03:20:05,920
i'm concerned about not i'm concerned
 

12207
03:20:05,920 --> 03:20:07,349
i'm concerned about not i'm concerned
more about like the harm that it would

12208
03:20:07,349 --> 03:20:07,359
more about like the harm that it would
 

12209
03:20:07,359 --> 03:20:09,830
more about like the harm that it would
cause if i left prematurely

12210
03:20:09,830 --> 03:20:09,840
cause if i left prematurely
 

12211
03:20:09,840 --> 03:20:11,349
cause if i left prematurely
and then kind of even bigger along the

12212
03:20:11,349 --> 03:20:11,359
and then kind of even bigger along the
 

12213
03:20:11,359 --> 03:20:13,030
and then kind of even bigger along the
lines of some of the stuff that ford

12214
03:20:13,030 --> 03:20:13,040
lines of some of the stuff that ford
 

12215
03:20:13,040 --> 03:20:13,990
lines of some of the stuff that ford
thinking we've been talking about

12216
03:20:13,990 --> 03:20:14,000
thinking we've been talking about
 

12217
03:20:14,000 --> 03:20:17,269
thinking we've been talking about
i i think maybe way too much about just

12218

like
 

12221
03:20:17,760 --> 03:20:20,150
like
and i'll never know the answer so even

12222
03:20:20,150 --> 03:20:20,160
and i'll never know the answer so even
 

12223
03:20:20,160 --> 03:20:20,870
and i'll never know the answer so even
if i live to

12224
03:20:20,870 --> 03:20:20,880
if i live to
 

12225
03:20:20,880 --> 03:20:23,349
if i live to
you know 120 like but like i want to

know as much as i can but like
how is this gonna work out like as

12230
03:20:27,429 --> 03:20:27,439
how is this gonna work out like as
 

12231
03:20:27,439 --> 03:20:28,550
how is this gonna work out like as
humans

12232
03:20:28,550 --> 03:20:28,560
humans
 

12233
03:20:28,560 --> 03:20:30,150
humans
are we and a big one i think is are we

are we and a big one i think is are we
 

12235
03:20:30,160 --> 03:20:31,830
are we and a big one i think is are we
gonna and i don't think unfortunately

12236

12241
03:20:36,080 --> 03:20:38,309
learn it in my lifetime even if i
lived to a ripe old age but well i don't

12242
03:20:38,309 --> 03:20:38,319
lived to a ripe old age but well i don't
 

12243
03:20:38,319 --> 03:20:40,150
lived to a ripe old age but well i don't
know is this gonna work out like

12244
03:20:40,150 --> 03:20:40,160
know is this gonna work out like
 

12245
03:20:40,160 --> 03:20:41,750
know is this gonna work out like
are we gonna escape the planet i think

12246
03:20:41,750 --> 03:20:41,760
are we gonna escape the planet i think
 

12247
03:20:41,760 --> 03:20:43,269
are we gonna escape the planet i think
that's one of the biggies like are we

12248
03:20:43,269 --> 03:20:43,279
that's one of the biggies like are we
 

12249
03:20:43,279 --> 03:20:43,830
that's one of the biggies like are we
gonna like

12250
03:20:43,830 --> 03:20:43,840
gonna like
 

12251
03:20:43,840 --> 03:20:45,510
gonna like
the survival of the speed like i think

12252
03:20:45,510 --> 03:20:45,520
the survival of the speed like i think
 

12253
03:20:45,520 --> 03:20:48,389
the survival of the speed like i think
the next like the time we're in now

12254
03:20:48,389 --> 03:20:48,399
the next like the time we're in now
 

12255
03:20:48,399 --> 03:20:50,070
the next like the time we're in now
it's like with the nuclear weapons with

12256
03:20:50,070 --> 03:20:50,080
it's like with the nuclear weapons with
 

12257
03:20:50,080 --> 03:20:51,429
it's like with the nuclear weapons with
pandemics and with

12258
03:20:51,429 --> 03:20:51,439
pandemics and with
 

12259
03:20:51,439 --> 03:20:53,990
pandemics and with
um uh i mean we're gonna get to the

12260
03:20:53,990 --> 03:20:54,000
um uh i mean we're gonna get to the
 

12261
03:20:54,000 --> 03:20:55,269
um uh i mean we're gonna get to the
point where anyone can

12262
03:20:55,269 --> 03:20:55,279
point where anyone can
 

12263
03:20:55,279 --> 03:20:57,750
point where anyone can
can build a hydrogen bomb like you know

12264
03:20:57,750 --> 03:20:57,760
can build a hydrogen bomb like you know
 

12265
03:20:57,760 --> 03:20:58,870
can build a hydrogen bomb like you know
it's like

12266
03:20:58,870 --> 03:20:58,880
it's like
 

12267
03:20:58,880 --> 03:21:01,269
it's like
you just like the exact or engineer like

12268
03:21:01,269 --> 03:21:01,279
you just like the exact or engineer like
 

12269
03:21:01,279 --> 03:21:02,550
you just like the exact or engineer like
the you know something that's a million

12270
03:21:02,550 --> 03:21:02,560
the you know something that's a million
 

12271
03:21:02,560 --> 03:21:03,990
the you know something that's a million
times worse than covet and then you

12272
03:21:03,990 --> 03:21:04,000
times worse than covet and then you
 

12273
03:21:04,000 --> 03:21:05,510
times worse than covet and then you
spread it it's like yeah we're getting

12274
03:21:05,510 --> 03:21:05,520
spread it it's like yeah we're getting
 

12275
03:21:05,520 --> 03:21:07,510
spread it it's like yeah we're getting
to this period of and then

12276
03:21:07,510 --> 03:21:07,520
to this period of and then
 

12277
03:21:07,520 --> 03:21:08,950
to this period of and then
not to mention climate change you know

12278
03:21:08,950 --> 03:21:08,960
not to mention climate change you know
 

12279
03:21:08,960 --> 03:21:10,790
not to mention climate change you know
it's like although i think that's not

12280
03:21:10,790 --> 03:21:10,800
it's like although i think that's not
 

12281
03:21:10,800 --> 03:21:12,150
it's like although i think that's not
there's probably going to be surviving

12282
03:21:12,150 --> 03:21:12,160
there's probably going to be surviving
 

12283
03:21:12,160 --> 03:21:14,309
there's probably going to be surviving
humans with that regard you know but

12284
03:21:14,309 --> 03:21:14,319
humans with that regard you know but
 

12285
03:21:14,319 --> 03:21:16,710
humans with that regard you know but
it could be really bad but these

12286
03:21:16,710 --> 03:21:16,720
it could be really bad but these
 

12287
03:21:16,720 --> 03:21:18,710
it could be really bad but these
existential threats i think the only

12288
03:21:18,710 --> 03:21:18,720
existential threats i think the only
 

12289
03:21:18,720 --> 03:21:20,150
existential threats i think the only
real guarantee that we're going to get

12290
03:21:20,150 --> 03:21:20,160
real guarantee that we're going to get
 

12291
03:21:20,160 --> 03:21:21,269
real guarantee that we're going to get
another

12292
03:21:21,269 --> 03:21:21,279
another
 

12293
03:21:21,279 --> 03:21:23,510
another
you name it thousand million whatever

12294
03:21:23,510 --> 03:21:23,520
you name it thousand million whatever
 

12295
03:21:23,520 --> 03:21:25,830
you name it thousand million whatever
years is like

12296
03:21:25,830 --> 03:21:25,840
years is like
 

12297
03:21:25,840 --> 03:21:28,469
years is like

and we're we're i don't know in terms of
 

12333
03:22:02,000 --> 03:22:04,070
and we're we're i don't know in terms of
the planet 4 billion years into this

12334

the planet 4 billion years into this
 

12335
03:22:04,080 --> 03:22:05,269
the planet 4 billion years into this
and depending on how you count our

12336
03:22:05,269 --> 03:22:05,279
and depending on how you count our
 

12337
03:22:05,279 --> 03:22:07,110
and depending on how you count our
species you know we're

12338
03:22:07,110 --> 03:22:07,120
species you know we're
 

12339
03:22:07,120 --> 03:22:08,550
species you know we're
you know we're millions of years into

12340
03:22:08,550 --> 03:22:08,560
you know we're millions of years into
 

12341
03:22:08,560 --> 03:22:10,229
you know we're millions of years into
this and it's like it's this is like the

12342
03:22:10,229 --> 03:22:10,239
this and it's like it's this is like the
 

12343
03:22:10,239 --> 03:22:11,030
this and it's like it's this is like the
point of the

12344
03:22:11,030 --> 03:22:11,040
point of the
 

12345
03:22:11,040 --> 03:22:13,590
point of the
relay race where we can really screw up

12346
03:22:13,590 --> 03:22:13,600
relay race where we can really screw up
 

12347
03:22:13,600 --> 03:22:15,110
relay race where we can really screw up
so that would make you feel pretty good

12348
03:22:15,110 --> 03:22:15,120
so that would make you feel pretty good
 

12349
03:22:15,120 --> 03:22:16,309
so that would make you feel pretty good
when you're on your

12350
03:22:16,309 --> 03:22:16,319
when you're on your
 

12351
03:22:16,319 --> 03:22:19,349
when you're on your
death bed 120 years old and there's

back to the psychedelics in terms of the
 

12495
03:25:00,399 --> 03:25:01,990
back to the psychedelics in terms of the
people in our our work with cancer

12496
03:25:01,990 --> 03:25:02,000
people in our our work with cancer
 

12497
03:25:02,000 --> 03:25:02,950
people in our our work with cancer
patients who

12498
03:25:02,950 --> 03:25:02,960
patients who
 

12499
03:25:02,960 --> 03:25:04,870
patients who
um we had psilocybin sessions to help

12500
03:25:04,870 --> 03:25:04,880
um we had psilocybin sessions to help
 

12501
03:25:04,880 --> 03:25:07,510
um we had psilocybin sessions to help
them and it did substantially help them

12509
03:25:12,560 --> 03:25:13,030
with these existential issues and i
think

12510
03:25:13,030 --> 03:25:13,040
think
 

12511
03:25:13,040 --> 03:25:14,630
think
you know it's something we i could say

12512
03:25:14,630 --> 03:25:14,640
you know it's something we i could say
 

12513
03:25:14,640 --> 03:25:16,710
you know it's something we i could say
that i really feel that i've come along

12514
03:25:16,710 --> 03:25:16,720
that i really feel that i've come along
 

12515
03:25:16,720 --> 03:25:17,190
that i really feel that i've come along
in that

12516
03:25:17,190 --> 03:25:17,200
in that
 

12517
03:25:17,200 --> 03:25:19,590
in that
both like being with folks who have died

12518
03:25:19,590 --> 03:25:19,600
both like being with folks who have died
 

12519
03:25:19,600 --> 03:25:20,550
both like being with folks who have died
that are close to me

12520
03:25:20,550 --> 03:25:20,560
that are close to me
 

12521
03:25:20,560 --> 03:25:22,950
that are close to me
and then also that work i think are the

12522
03:25:22,950 --> 03:25:22,960
and then also that work i think are the
 

12523
03:25:22,960 --> 03:25:25,349
and then also that work i think are the
two biggies and sort of like

12524
03:25:25,349 --> 03:25:25,359
two biggies and sort of like
 

12525
03:25:25,359 --> 03:25:27,190
two biggies and sort of like
you know i think i've come along and

12526
03:25:27,190 --> 03:25:27,200
you know i think i've come along and
 

12527
03:25:27,200 --> 03:25:29,750
you know i think i've come along and
that that sort of acceptance of this

12528
03:25:29,750 --> 03:25:29,760
that that sort of acceptance of this
 

12529
03:25:29,760 --> 03:25:32,790
that that sort of acceptance of this
like like it's not gonna last

12530
03:25:32,790 --> 03:25:32,800
like like it's not gonna last
 

12531
03:25:32,800 --> 03:25:34,790
like like it's not gonna last
um any whether at the personal level or

12532
03:25:34,790 --> 03:25:34,800
um any whether at the personal level or
 

12533
03:25:34,800 --> 03:25:36,389
um any whether at the personal level or
even at the species levels like at some

12534
03:25:36,389 --> 03:25:36,399
even at the species levels like at some
 

12535
03:25:36,399 --> 03:25:37,750
even at the species levels like at some
point all the stars are going to fade

12536
03:25:37,750 --> 03:25:37,760
point all the stars are going to fade
 

12537
03:25:37,760 --> 03:25:38,309
point all the stars are going to fade
out

12538
03:25:38,309 --> 03:25:38,319
out
 

12539
03:25:38,319 --> 03:25:39,670
out
and it's going to be the realm of which

12540
03:25:39,670 --> 03:25:39,680
and it's going to be the realm of which
 

12541
03:25:39,680 --> 03:25:41,030
and it's going to be the realm of which
is going to be the vast majority if it

12542
03:25:41,030 --> 03:25:41,040
is going to be the vast majority if it
 

12543
03:25:41,040 --> 03:25:41,510
is going to be the vast majority if it
can

12544
03:25:41,510 --> 03:25:41,520
can
 

12545
03:25:41,520 --> 03:25:42,870
can
unless there's a big crunch which

12546
03:25:42,870 --> 03:25:42,880
unless there's a big crunch which
 

12547
03:25:42,880 --> 03:25:44,630
unless there's a big crunch which
apparently doesn't seem likely

12548
03:25:44,630 --> 03:25:44,640
apparently doesn't seem likely
 

12549
03:25:44,640 --> 03:25:46,229
apparently doesn't seem likely
like most of the universe there's this

12550
03:25:46,229 --> 03:25:46,239
like most of the universe there's this
 

12551
03:25:46,239 --> 03:25:47,510
like most of the universe there's this
blink of an eye that's happening right

12552
03:25:47,510 --> 03:25:47,520
blink of an eye that's happening right
 

12553
03:25:47,520 --> 03:25:49,190
blink of an eye that's happening right
now that life is even possible

12554
03:25:49,190 --> 03:25:49,200
now that life is even possible
 

12555
03:25:49,200 --> 03:25:51,670
now that life is even possible
like the era of stars so it's like we're

12556
03:25:51,670 --> 03:25:51,680
like the era of stars so it's like we're
 

12557
03:25:51,680 --> 03:25:53,269
like the era of stars so it's like we're
going to fade out at some point

12558
03:25:53,269 --> 03:25:53,279
going to fade out at some point
 

12559
03:25:53,279 --> 03:25:56,389
going to fade out at some point
like you know and you know then we get

12560
03:25:56,389 --> 03:25:56,399
like you know and you know then we get
 

12561
03:25:56,399 --> 03:25:58,389
like you know and you know then we get
at this level of consciousness and like

12562
03:25:58,389 --> 03:25:58,399
at this level of consciousness and like
 

12563
03:25:58,399 --> 03:26:00,469
at this level of consciousness and like
okay maybe there is life after death

12564
03:26:00,469 --> 03:26:00,479
okay maybe there is life after death
 

12565
03:26:00,479 --> 03:26:02,070
okay maybe there is life after death
maybe there's maybe times an illusion

12566
03:26:02,070 --> 03:26:02,080
maybe there's maybe times an illusion
 

12567
03:26:02,080 --> 03:26:02,550
maybe there's maybe times an illusion
maybe

12568
03:26:02,550 --> 03:26:02,560
maybe
 

12569
03:26:02,560 --> 03:26:05,269
maybe
like that part i'm ready for like i'm

12570
03:26:05,269 --> 03:26:05,279
like that part i'm ready for like i'm
 

12571
03:26:05,279 --> 03:26:05,830

i'm like
you know like strap that that would be

12574
03:26:07,910 --> 03:26:07,920
you know like strap that that would be
 

12575
03:26:07,920 --> 03:26:09,030
you know like strap that that would be
really great and i'm looking

12576
03:26:09,030 --> 03:26:09,040
really great and i'm looking
 

12577
03:26:09,040 --> 03:26:10,469
really great and i'm looking
i'm not afraid of that at all it's like

12578
03:26:10,469 --> 03:26:10,479
i'm not afraid of that at all it's like
 

12579
03:26:10,479 --> 03:26:12,870
i'm not afraid of that at all it's like
even if it's just strange like if i

12580
03:26:12,870 --> 03:26:12,880
even if it's just strange like if i
 

12581
03:26:12,880 --> 03:26:13,190
even if it's just strange like if i
could

12582
03:26:13,190 --> 03:26:13,200
could
 

12583
03:26:13,200 --> 03:26:15,429
could
push a button to enter that door i mean

12584
03:26:15,429 --> 03:26:15,439
push a button to enter that door i mean
 

12585
03:26:15,439 --> 03:26:16,870
push a button to enter that door i mean
i'm not gonna you know die you're not

gonna kill myself but it's like

12588
03:26:18,790 --> 03:26:18,800
gonna kill myself but it's like
 

12589
03:26:18,800 --> 03:26:20,070
gonna kill myself but it's like
if i could take a peek at what that

12590
03:26:20,070 --> 03:26:20,080
if i could take a peek at what that
 

12591
03:26:20,080 --> 03:26:22,309
if i could take a peek at what that
reality is or choose at the end of my

12592
03:26:22,309 --> 03:26:22,319
reality is or choose at the end of my
 

12593
03:26:22,319 --> 03:26:23,910
reality is or choose at the end of my
life if i could choose of

12594
03:26:23,910 --> 03:26:23,920
life if i could choose of
 

12595
03:26:23,920 --> 03:26:26,150
life if i could choose of
entering into a universe where there is

12596
03:26:26,150 --> 03:26:26,160
entering into a universe where there is
 

12597
03:26:26,160 --> 03:26:27,750
entering into a universe where there is
an afterlife of something completely

12598
03:26:27,750 --> 03:26:27,760
an afterlife of something completely
 

12599
03:26:27,760 --> 03:26:29,429
an afterlife of something completely
unknown versus one where there's none i

12600
03:26:29,429 --> 03:26:29,439
unknown versus one where there's none i
 

12601
03:26:29,439 --> 03:26:30,710
unknown versus one where there's none i
think i'd say well let's see what's

12602
03:26:30,710 --> 03:26:30,720
think i'd say well let's see what's
 

12603
03:26:30,720 --> 03:26:32,150
think i'd say well let's see what's
behind that

12604
03:26:32,150 --> 03:26:32,160
behind that
 

12605
03:26:32,160 --> 03:26:33,830
behind that
that's a true scientist way of thinking

12606
03:26:33,830 --> 03:26:33,840
that's a true scientist way of thinking
 

12607
03:26:33,840 --> 03:26:35,190
that's a true scientist way of thinking
if there's a door

12608
03:26:35,190 --> 03:26:35,200
if there's a door
 

12609
03:26:35,200 --> 03:26:37,110
if there's a door
you're excited about opening and going

12610
03:26:37,110 --> 03:26:37,120
you're excited about opening and going
 

12611
03:26:37,120 --> 03:26:38,790
you're excited about opening and going
in right

12612
03:26:38,790 --> 03:26:38,800
in right
 

12613
03:26:38,800 --> 03:26:41,910
in right
but i am attracted to this idea like

12614
03:26:41,910 --> 03:26:41,920
but i am attracted to this idea like
 

12615
03:26:41,920 --> 03:26:43,750
but i am attracted to this idea like
like you know it's and i recognize it's

12616
03:26:43,750 --> 03:26:43,760
like you know it's and i recognize it's
 

12617
03:26:43,760 --> 03:26:44,950
like you know it's and i recognize it's
easier said than done

12618
03:26:44,950 --> 03:26:44,960
easier said than done
 

12619
03:26:44,960 --> 03:26:47,670
easier said than done
to say i'm okay with not existing yeah

12620
03:26:47,670 --> 03:26:47,680
to say i'm okay with not existing yeah
 

12621
03:26:47,680 --> 03:26:49,030
to say i'm okay with not existing yeah
it's like the real test is like okay

12622
03:26:49,030 --> 03:26:49,040
it's like the real test is like okay
 

12623
03:26:49,040 --> 03:26:50,309
it's like the real test is like okay
check me on my deathbed

12624
03:26:50,309 --> 03:26:50,319
check me on my deathbed
 

12625
03:26:50,319 --> 03:26:51,990
check me on my deathbed
you know it's like it's oh yes i'll be

12626
03:26:51,990 --> 03:26:52,000
you know it's like it's oh yes i'll be
 

12627
03:26:52,000 --> 03:26:53,910
you know it's like it's oh yes i'll be
all right it is beautiful thing and the

12628
03:26:53,910 --> 03:26:53,920
all right it is beautiful thing and the
 

12629
03:26:53,920 --> 03:26:55,750
all right it is beautiful thing and the
humility of surrendering and

12630
03:26:55,750 --> 03:26:55,760
humility of surrendering and
 

12631
03:26:55,760 --> 03:26:58,229
humility of surrendering and
i really hope and i think i'd probably

12632
03:26:58,229 --> 03:26:58,239
i really hope and i think i'd probably
 

12633
03:26:58,239 --> 03:26:59,910
i really hope and i think i'd probably
be more likely to be in that realm right

12634
03:26:59,910 --> 03:26:59,920
be more likely to be in that realm right
 

12635
03:26:59,920 --> 03:27:02,630
be more likely to be in that realm right
now than i would like or check me when i

12636
03:27:02,630 --> 03:27:02,640
now than i would like or check me when i
 

12637
03:27:02,640 --> 03:27:03,190
now than i would like or check me when i
get

12638
03:27:03,190 --> 03:27:03,200
get
 

12639
03:27:03,200 --> 03:27:05,590
get
a terminal cancer diagnosis and i really

12640
03:27:05,590 --> 03:27:05,600
a terminal cancer diagnosis and i really
 

12641
03:27:05,600 --> 03:27:07,670
a terminal cancer diagnosis and i really
hope i'm more in that realm but i

12642
03:27:07,670 --> 03:27:07,680
hope i'm more in that realm but i
 

12643
03:27:07,680 --> 03:27:10,229
hope i'm more in that realm but i
i know enough about human nature to know

12644
03:27:10,229 --> 03:27:10,239
i know enough about human nature to know
 

12645
03:27:10,239 --> 03:27:11,269
i know enough about human nature to know
that like i don't want to

12646
03:27:11,269 --> 03:27:11,279
that like i don't want to
 

12647
03:27:11,279 --> 03:27:12,710
that like i don't want to
i can't really speak to that because i

12648
03:27:12,710 --> 03:27:12,720
i can't really speak to that because i
 

12649
03:27:12,720 --> 03:27:14,950
i can't really speak to that because i
haven't been in that situation

12650
03:27:14,950 --> 03:27:14,960
haven't been in that situation
 

12651
03:27:14,960 --> 03:27:16,469
haven't been in that situation
and i think there can be a beauty to

12652
03:27:16,469 --> 03:27:16,479
and i think there can be a beauty to
 

12653
03:27:16,479 --> 03:27:19,349
and i think there can be a beauty to
that and the transcendence of like yeah

12654
03:27:19,349 --> 03:27:19,359
that and the transcendence of like yeah
 

12655
03:27:19,359 --> 03:27:22,070
that and the transcendence of like yeah
and you know it was it was beautiful not

12656
03:27:22,070 --> 03:27:22,080
and you know it was it was beautiful not
 

12657
03:27:22,080 --> 03:27:24,070
and you know it was it was beautiful not
just despite all that but because of

12658
03:27:24,070 --> 03:27:24,080
just despite all that but because of
 

12659
03:27:24,080 --> 03:27:24,870
just despite all that but because of
that

12660
03:27:24,870 --> 03:27:24,880
that
 

12661
03:27:24,880 --> 03:27:26,469
that
because ultimately there's going to be

12662

we're figuring out
 

12819
03:30:22,560 --> 03:30:24,630
we're figuring out
