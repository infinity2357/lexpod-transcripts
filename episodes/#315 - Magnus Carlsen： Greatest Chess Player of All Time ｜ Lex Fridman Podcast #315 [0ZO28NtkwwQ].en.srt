the two and then i tried to argue the
 

317
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,710
the two and then i tried to argue the
quantum mechanical thing well can you

318
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:26,720
quantum mechanical thing well can you
 

319
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,749
quantum mechanical thing well can you
what

320
00:05:27,749 --> 00:05:27,759
what
 

321
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,110
what
again what

00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:29,120
again what
 

323
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,590
again what
what would uh if you were to argue for

00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:31,600
what would uh if you were to argue for
 

325
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,189
what would uh if you were to argue for
either one

326
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:35,199

debate between
 

337
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,950
debate between
unquantifiable greatness no that i mean

338
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:46,960
unquantifiable greatness no that i mean
 

339
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,070
unquantifiable greatness no that i mean
that's the whole that's the whole debate

340
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:50,080
that's the whole that's the whole debate
 

341
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,550
that's the whole that's the whole debate
yes so it's well it's quantifiable

342
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:52,560
yes so it's well it's quantifiable
 

343
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,629
yes so it's well it's quantifiable
versus unquantifiable yeah what's more

344
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:54,639
versus unquantifiable yeah what's more
 

345
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,950
versus unquantifiable yeah what's more
important and you're depending on mood

346
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:56,960
important and you're depending on mood
 

347
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,430
important and you're depending on mood
yeah all over the place

yeah all over the place
 

349
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,189
yeah all over the place
but what do you lean in general with

350
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:01,199
but what do you lean in general with
 

351
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,029

towards the unquantifiable more no

356
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:08,000
towards the unquantifiable more no
 

357
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,550
towards the unquantifiable more no
definitely towards the quantifiable so

358
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:10,560
definitely towards the quantifiable so
 

359
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,909
definitely towards the quantifiable so
when you're unsure lean towards the

360
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:11,919
when you're unsure lean towards the
 

361
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,749
when you're unsure lean towards the
numbers yeah but see like it's later

362
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:13,759
numbers yeah but see like it's later
 

363
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,749
numbers yeah but see like it's later
generations

364
00:06:15,749 --> 00:06:15,759
generations
 

365
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,029
generations
there's something that's what people say

366
00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:17,039
there's something that's what people say

on your team
 

413
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,990
on your team
it would be very interesting just uh if

414
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:16,000
it would be very interesting just uh if
 

415
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,749
it would be very interesting just uh if
the league could make a

416
00:07:17,749 --> 00:07:17,759
the league could make a
 

417
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,350
the league could make a
decision

418
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:19,360
decision
 

419
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,629
decision
yeah just random random allocation yeah

420
00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:22,639
yeah just random random allocation yeah
 

421
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,830
yeah just random random allocation yeah
um

422
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:25,840

 

423
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,510

and just every single game just keep

424
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:27,520
and just every single game just keep
 

425
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,950
and just every single game just keep
relocating or maybe once a season um or

426
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:30,960
relocating or maybe once a season um or
 

427
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,029
relocating or maybe once a season um or
every season you get random but let's

428
00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:33,039
every season you get random but let's
 

429
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:34,710
every season you get random but let's
say every

430
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:34,720
say every
 

431
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,710
say every
every player

432
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:36,720
every player
 

433
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,830
every player
um

434
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:37,840
um
 

435
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,230
um
if let's say they sign a five-year

436
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:40,240
if let's say they sign a five-year
 

437
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,309
if let's say they sign a five-year
contract for a team like one of them

438
00:07:42,309 --> 00:07:42,319
contract for a team like one of them
 

439
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:43,830
contract for a team like one of them
you're going to get randomly allocated

440
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:43,840
you're going to get randomly allocated
 

441
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,950
you're going to get randomly allocated
to

442
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:44,960
to
 

443
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,390
to
to let's say a bottom half team

444
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:48,400
to let's say a bottom half team
 

445
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,589
to let's say a bottom half team
i bet you there's going to be so much

446
00:07:49,589 --> 00:07:49,599
i bet you there's going to be so much
 

447
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,510
i bet you there's going to be so much
corruption around that could be not

448
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:51,520
corruption around that could be not
 

449
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,110
corruption around that could be not
obviously it wouldn't

450
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:53,120
obviously it wouldn't
 

451
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,510
obviously it wouldn't
ever happen or or work but i think it's

452
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:55,520
ever happen or or work but i think it's
 

453
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,029
ever happen or or work but i think it's
if you never know first thing to think

454
00:07:57,029 --> 00:07:57,039
if you never know first thing to think
 

455
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,510
if you never know first thing to think
about so on chess

456
00:07:59,510 --> 00:07:59,520
about so on chess
 

457
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,430
about so on chess
let's uh zoom out

458
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:01,440
let's uh zoom out
 

459
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,390
let's uh zoom out
if you break down your approach to chess

460
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:04,400
if you break down your approach to chess
 

461
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,390
if you break down your approach to chess
when you're at your best

462
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:06,400
when you're at your best
 

463
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,990
when you're at your best
uh what

464
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:08,000
uh what
 

465
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,710
uh what
what do you think um

466
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:10,720
what do you think um
 

467
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,990
what do you think um
what do you think contributes to that

468
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:12,000
what do you think contributes to that
 

469
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,990
what do you think contributes to that
approach is it memory recall specific

470
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:14,000
approach is it memory recall specific
 

471
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,550
approach is it memory recall specific
lines and positions is it intuition how

472
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:16,560
lines and positions is it intuition how
 

473
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,629
lines and positions is it intuition how
much of it is intuition how much of it

474
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:18,639
much of it is intuition how much of it
 

475
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,950
much of it is intuition how much of it
is pure calculation how much of it is

476
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:20,960
is pure calculation how much of it is
 

477
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,469
is pure calculation how much of it is
messing with the strategy of the

478
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:22,479
messing with the strategy of the
 

479
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,270
messing with the strategy of the
opponent so the game theory aspect

480
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:25,280
opponent so the game theory aspect
 

481
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,189
opponent so the game theory aspect
in terms of what contributes to the

482
00:08:27,189 --> 00:08:27,199
in terms of what contributes to the
 

483
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,749
in terms of what contributes to the
highest level of play that um that you

484
00:08:29,749 --> 00:08:29,759
highest level of play that um that you
 

485
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:30,710
highest level of play that um that you
do

486
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:30,720
do
 

487
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,230
do
i think

488
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:32,240
i think
 

489
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,230
i think
the answer

490
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:34,240
the answer
 

491
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,149
the answer
differs a little bit now from what it

492
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:36,159
differs a little bit now from what it
 

493
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,430
differs a little bit now from what it
did

494
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:37,440
did
 

495
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,029
did
eight years ago

496
00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:39,039
eight years ago
 

497
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,949
eight years ago
for instance like i've i feel like i've

for instance like i've i feel like i've
 

499
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,470
for instance like i've i feel like i've
had like two peaks in in my career in

500

501
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,990
had like two peaks in in my career in
2014

502
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:46,000
2014
 

503
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,110
2014
uh well 2013 2014 and also in 2019 and

uh well 2013 2014 and also in 2019 and
in those

506
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:52,320
in those
 

507
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,030
in those
years i i was very different

508
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:55,040
years i i was very different
 

509
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,389
years i i was very different
um

510
00:08:56,389 --> 00:08:56,399
um
 

511
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,310
um
in terms of um

512
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:58,320
in terms of um
 

513
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,070
in terms of um
of my strength

514
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:00,080
of my strength
 

515
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,269
of my strength
strengths as specifically in 2019 i

516
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:03,279
strengths as specifically in 2019 i
 

517
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,190
strengths as specifically in 2019 i
benefited a lot from

518
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:05,200
benefited a lot from
 

519
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,030
benefited a lot from
opening preparation

520
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:07,040
opening preparation
 

521
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,710
opening preparation
uh while in 2013 2014 i mostly tried to

522
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:10,720
uh while in 2013 2014 i mostly tried to
 

523
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,230
uh while in 2013 2014 i mostly tried to
avoid my

524
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:12,240
avoid my
 

525
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,150
avoid my
uh opponent's

526
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:14,160
uh opponent's
 

527
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,509
uh opponent's
preparation rather than that being a um

528
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:17,519
preparation rather than that being a um
 

529
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,110
preparation rather than that being a um
being a strength

530
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:19,120
being a strength
 

531
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,230
being a strength
so

532
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:20,240
so
 

533
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,070
so
i'm mentioning that also because it's

534
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:22,080
i'm mentioning that also because it's
 

535
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,710
i'm mentioning that also because it's
something something you didn't um

536
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:24,720
something something you didn't um
 

537
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,310
something something you didn't um
didn't mention i think like my

538
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:28,320
didn't mention i think like my
 

539
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,949
didn't mention i think like my
intuitive understanding of chess has

540
00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:30,959
intuitive understanding of chess has
 

541
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,949
intuitive understanding of chess has
over those years

542
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:32,959
over those years
 

543
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,269
over those years
always been a little bit

544
00:09:35,269 --> 00:09:35,279
always been a little bit
 

545
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,190
always been a little bit
better than the others even though it

546
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:37,200
better than the others even though it
 

547
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,550
better than the others even though it
has

548
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:38,560
has
 

549
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,949
has
evolved as well um

550
00:09:40,949 --> 00:09:40,959
evolved as well um
 

551
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,030
evolved as well um
certainly there are there are things

552
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:43,040
certainly there are there are things
 

553
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,710
certainly there are there are things
that i understand now that i didn't

554
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:44,720
that i understand now that i didn't
 

555
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,230
that i understand now that i didn't
understand

556
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:46,240
understand
 

557
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,990
understand
back then but that's not only for me

558
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:48,000
back then but that's not only for me
 

559
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,590
back then but that's not only for me
that's for

560
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:49,600
that's for
 

561
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,829
that's for
for others as well

562
00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:51,839
for others as well
 

563
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,070
for others as well
i was younger back then so i played with

564
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:54,080
i was younger back then so i played with
 

565
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,910
i was younger back then so i played with
more energy which meant that i could

566
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:55,920
more energy which meant that i could
 

567
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,269
more energy which meant that i could
play better in long drawn out

568
00:09:59,269 --> 00:09:59,279
play better in long drawn out
 

569
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,670
play better in long drawn out
games

570
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:01,680
games
 

571
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,590
games
which was also a necessity for me

572
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:03,600
which was also a necessity for me
 

573
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,269
which was also a necessity for me
because i didn't i couldn't

574
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:05,279
because i didn't i couldn't
 

575
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,190
because i didn't i couldn't
couldn't beat people in the

576
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:07,200
couldn't beat people in the
 

577
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,110
couldn't beat people in the
in the openings um

578
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:09,120
in the openings um
 

579
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,710
in the openings um
but

580
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:10,720
but
 

581
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,269
but
in terms of calculation that's always

582
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:13,279
in terms of calculation that's always
 

583
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,350
in terms of calculation that's always
been a weird issue for

584
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:15,360
been a weird issue for
 

585
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,790
been a weird issue for
me like i've always been really really

586
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:18,800
me like i've always been really really
 

587
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,670
me like i've always been really really
um

588
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:19,680
um
 

589
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,230
um
bad at solving exercises in chess like

590
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:24,240
bad at solving exercises in chess like
 

591
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,110
bad at solving exercises in chess like
that's been

592
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:27,120
that's been
 

593
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,350
that's been
like a blind spot for me first of all i

594
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:29,360
like a blind spot for me first of all i
 

595
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,190
like a blind spot for me first of all i
found it hard to

596
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:31,200
found it hard to
 

597
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,310
found it hard to
concentrate on them um

598
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:34,320
concentrate on them um
 

599
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,190
concentrate on them um
and to look

600
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:37,200

 

601
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,350

uh to look deep enough so this is like a

602
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:39,360
uh to look deep enough so this is like a
 

603
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,630
uh to look deep enough so this is like a
puzzle a position yeah me in x i mean

604
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:42,640
puzzle a position yeah me in x i mean
 

605
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,389
puzzle a position yeah me in x i mean
one thing is made but

606
00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:44,399
one thing is made but
 

607
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,230
one thing is made but
find the best move that's generally the

608
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:46,240
find the best move that's generally the
 

609
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,470
find the best move that's generally the
exercise like find the best move find

610
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:48,480
exercise like find the best move find
 

611
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,710
exercise like find the best move find
the best line

612
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:50,720
the best line
 

613
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,230
the best line
you just don't connect with it usually

614
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:52,240
you just don't connect with it usually
 

615
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,870
you just don't connect with it usually
like you have to to look look deep and

616
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:54,880
like you have to to look look deep and
 

617
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,590
like you have to to look look deep and
then when i get these lines during

618
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:57,600
then when i get these lines during
 

619
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,509
then when i get these lines during
the game i've

620
00:10:59,509 --> 00:10:59,519
the game i've
 

621
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,990
the game i've
very often find

622
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:02,000
very often find
 

623
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,030
very often find
the

624
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:03,040
the
 

625
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,430
the
the right solution even though

626
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:05,440
the right solution even though
 

627
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,310
the right solution even though
um

628
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:08,320

 

629
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,750

even though i'm it's not still

630
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:11,760
even though i'm it's not still
 

631
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,590
even though i'm it's not still
the best part of my game

632
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:13,600
the best part of my game
 

633
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,069
the best part of my game
to to calculate very

634
00:11:16,069 --> 00:11:16,079
to to calculate very
 

635
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,829
to to calculate very
very deeply but it doesn't feel like

636
00:11:17,829 --> 00:11:17,839
very deeply but it doesn't feel like
 

637
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,829
very deeply but it doesn't feel like
calculation you're saying

638
00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:19,839
calculation you're saying
 

639
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,430
calculation you're saying
in terms of no it does sometimes but

640
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:23,440
in terms of no it does sometimes but
 

641
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,030
in terms of no it does sometimes but
for me it's more like i'm at the board

642
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:25,040
for me it's more like i'm at the board
 

643
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,870
for me it's more like i'm at the board
trying to find trying to find the

644
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:26,880
trying to find trying to find the
 

645
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,389
trying to find trying to find the
solution and i understand like the

646
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:28,399
solution and i understand like the
 

647
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,590
solution and i understand like the
training

648
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:29,600
training
 

649
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,990
training
at home is like trying a little bit to

650
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:32,000
at home is like trying a little bit to
 

651
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,470
at home is like trying a little bit to
to replicate that like you give somebody

652
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:34,480
to replicate that like you give somebody
 

653
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,829
to replicate that like you give somebody
half an hour um in a position like in

654
00:11:37,829 --> 00:11:37,839
half an hour um in a position like in
 

655
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,030
half an hour um in a position like in
this

656
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:39,040
this
 

657
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,550
this
instance you might have thought for half

658
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:40,560
instance you might have thought for half
 

659
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,430
instance you might have thought for half
an hour if you play the game but i just

660
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:43,440
an hour if you play the game but i just
 

661
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,990
an hour if you play the game but i just
i just cannot do it one thing i know

662
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:46,000
i just cannot do it one thing i know
 

663
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,750
i just cannot do it one thing i know
that i am good at though

664
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:47,760
that i am good at though
 

665
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,509
that i am good at though
is

666
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:49,519
is
 

667
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:50,629
is
calculating

668
00:11:50,629 --> 00:11:50,639
calculating
 

669
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,550
calculating
short lines

670
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:52,560
short lines
 

671
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,030
short lines
because i calculate them them well i'm

672
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:55,040
because i calculate them them well i'm
 

673
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,190
because i calculate them them well i'm
good at seeing

674
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:57,200
good at seeing
 

675
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,269
good at seeing
little details and i'm also

676
00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:01,279
little details and i'm also
 

677
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,750
little details and i'm also
much better than than most at uh

678
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:03,760
much better than than most at uh
 

679
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,430
much better than than most at uh
evaluating

680
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:05,440
evaluating
 

681
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,550
evaluating
which i think is something that sets me

682
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:08,560
which i think is something that sets me
 

683
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,910
which i think is something that sets me
sets me uh apart from from others so

684
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:11,920
sets me uh apart from from others so
 

685
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,230
sets me uh apart from from others so
evaluating specific position

686
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:14,240
evaluating specific position
 

687
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,910
evaluating specific position
if i

688
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:15,920
if i
 

689
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,910
if i
if i make this move and the position

690
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:17,920
if i make this move and the position
 

691
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,230
if i make this move and the position
changes in this way

692
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:20,240
changes in this way
 

693
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,470
changes in this way
is this the step in the right direction

694
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:22,480
is this the step in the right direction
 

695
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,110
is this the step in the right direction
like in a big picture way yeah like you

696
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:25,120
like in a big picture way yeah like you
 

697
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,030
like in a big picture way yeah like you
calculate a few moves ahead and then you

698
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:27,040
calculate a few moves ahead and then you
 

699
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,069
calculate a few moves ahead and then you
evaluate because a lot a lot of time

700
00:12:30,069 --> 00:12:30,079
evaluate because a lot a lot of time
 

701
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,150
evaluate because a lot a lot of time
a lot of the times you cannot

702
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:32,160
a lot of the times you cannot
 

703
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,470
a lot of the times you cannot
um the branches become so big that you

704
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:34,480
um the branches become so big that you
 

705
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,310
um the branches become so big that you
cannot calculate everything so you have

706
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:36,320
cannot calculate everything so you have
 

707
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,870
cannot calculate everything so you have
a fog yeah so you have to you have to

708
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:38,880
a fog yeah so you have to you have to
 

709
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,629
a fog yeah so you have to you have to
make evaluations based on you know

710
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:42,639
make evaluations based on you know
 

711
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,269
make evaluations based on you know
based based mostly on knowledge and and

712
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:45,279
based based mostly on knowledge and and
 

713
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,230
based based mostly on knowledge and and
intuition and somehow i seem to do that

714
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:48,240
intuition and somehow i seem to do that
 

715
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,710
intuition and somehow i seem to do that
uh pretty well when you say you're good

716
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:50,720
uh pretty well when you say you're good
 

717
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,870
uh pretty well when you say you're good
at short lines what's that what's what's

718
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:52,880
at short lines what's that what's what's
 

719
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,750
at short lines what's that what's what's
short

720
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:53,760
short
 

721
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,190
short
that's usually like lines of um

722
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:57,200
that's usually like lines of um
 

723
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,670
that's usually like lines of um
two to four moves each okay so that

724
00:12:59,670 --> 00:12:59,680
two to four moves each okay so that
 

725
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,430
two to four moves each okay so that
that's directly applicable to even

726
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:01,440
that's directly applicable to even
 

727
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,910
that's directly applicable to even
faster games like blitz chess and so on

728
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:03,920
faster games like blitz chess and so on
 

729
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,389
faster games like blitz chess and so on
yeah um blitz is

730
00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:06,399
yeah um blitz is
 

731
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:07,430
yeah um blitz is
a lot about

732
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:07,440
a lot about
 

733
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,269
a lot about
calculating force lines

734
00:13:09,269 --> 00:13:09,279
calculating force lines
 

735
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,670
calculating force lines
so those

736
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:11,680
so those
 

737
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,910
so those
you can see pretty clearly that the

738
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:13,920
you can see pretty clearly that the
 

739
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,910
you can see pretty clearly that the
players who struggle at blitz who are

740
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:15,920
players who struggle at blitz who are
 

741
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,269
players who struggle at blitz who are
great at classical are those who rely on

742
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:19,279
great at classical are those who rely on
 

743
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,750
great at classical are those who rely on
a deep calculating ability because you

744
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:21,760
a deep calculating ability because you
 

745
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,910
a deep calculating ability because you
simply ha don't have time for for that

746
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:23,920
simply ha don't have time for for that
 

747
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,990
simply ha don't have time for for that
templates you have to calculate quickly

748
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:26,000
templates you have to calculate quickly
 

749
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,590
templates you have to calculate quickly
and rely a lot on iteration can you try

750
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:29,600
and rely a lot on iteration can you try
 

751
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,949
and rely a lot on iteration can you try
to i know it's really difficult can you

752
00:13:30,949 --> 00:13:30,959
to i know it's really difficult can you
 

753
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,550
to i know it's really difficult can you
try to

754
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:32,560
try to
 

755
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,470
try to
talk through what's actually being

756
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:34,480
talk through what's actually being
 

757
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,230
talk through what's actually being
visualized in your head

758
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:36,240
visualized in your head
 

759
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,670
visualized in your head
is there

760
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:37,680
is there
 

761
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,590
is there
is there a visual component yeah no i

762
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:39,600
is there a visual component yeah no i
 

763
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,509
is there a visual component yeah no i
just visualized the board i mean the

764
00:13:41,509 --> 00:13:41,519
just visualized the board i mean the
 

765
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,629
just visualized the board i mean the
board isn't as in as in my head

766
00:13:44,629 --> 00:13:44,639
board isn't as in as in my head
 

767
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,949
board isn't as in as in my head
two-dimensional my interpretation is

768
00:13:46,949 --> 00:13:46,959
two-dimensional my interpretation is
 

769
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,829
two-dimensional my interpretation is
that it's it is too uh two-dimensional

770
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:49,839
that it's it is too uh two-dimensional
 

771
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,629
that it's it is too uh two-dimensional
like what color is is is it brown tinted

772
00:13:52,629 --> 00:13:52,639
like what color is is is it brown tinted
 

773
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,470
like what color is is is it brown tinted
is it black is it

774
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:54,480
is it black is it
 

775
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,550
is it black is it
uh like what's the theme is it a big

776
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:56,560
uh like what's the theme is it a big
 

777
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,069
uh like what's the theme is it a big
bore small board

778
00:13:58,069 --> 00:13:58,079
bore small board
 

779
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:58,949
bore small board
are the

780
00:13:58,949 --> 00:13:58,959
are the
 

781
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,829
are the
uh what do the pawns look

782
00:14:00,829 --> 00:14:00,839
uh what do the pawns look
 

783
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,030
uh what do the pawns look
like or is it more in the space of

784
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:03,040
like or is it more in the space of
 

785
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,069
like or is it more in the space of
concepts

786
00:14:04,069 --> 00:14:04,079
concepts
 

787
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:05,269
concepts
like uh

788
00:14:05,269 --> 00:14:05,279
like uh
 

789
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:05,990
like uh
yeah

790
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:06,000
yeah
 

791
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,590
yeah
there are there aren't a lot of colors

792
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:07,600
there are there aren't a lot of colors
 

793
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,560
there are there aren't a lot of colors
it's it's mostly

794
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:08,570
it's it's mostly
 

795
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:10,230
it's it's mostly
[Laughter]

796
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:10,240
[Laughter]
 

797
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,069
[Laughter]
so what is it queen's gambit on the

798
00:14:12,069 --> 00:14:12,079
so what is it queen's gambit on the
 

799
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:15,110
so what is it queen's gambit on the
ceiling whatever

800
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:15,120

 

801
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,949

to imagine it what about when you do the

802
00:14:16,949 --> 00:14:16,959
to imagine it what about when you do the
 

803
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,470
to imagine it what about when you do the
branching when you have multiple boards

804
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:18,480
branching when you have multiple boards
 

805
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,230
branching when you have multiple boards
and so on what how does that look are

806
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:20,240
and so on what how does that look are
 

807
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,150
and so on what how does that look are
you no there's only one at a time so

808
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:22,160
you no there's only one at a time so
 

809
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,069
you no there's only one at a time so
like position in time one position at a

810
00:14:24,069 --> 00:14:24,079
like position in time one position at a
 

811
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:25,750
like position in time one position at a
time so then i go back

812
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:25,760
time so then i go back
 

813
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,910
time so then i go back
and and that's what when when people

814
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:27,920
and and that's what when when people
 

815
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,110
and and that's what when when people
play

816
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:29,120
play
 

817
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,269
play
or at least that's what i do when i play

818
00:14:31,269 --> 00:14:31,279
or at least that's what i do when i play
 

819
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,269
or at least that's what i do when i play
blindfold chess against several people

820
00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:33,279
blindfold chess against several people
 

821
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,430
blindfold chess against several people
then it's just always one border at a

822
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:35,440
then it's just always one border at a
 

823
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,550
then it's just always one border at a
time and

824
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:36,560
time and
 

825
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,269
time and
the rest are stored away somewhere but

826
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:39,279
the rest are stored away somewhere but
 

827
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,949
the rest are stored away somewhere but
how do you store them away so like you

828
00:14:40,949 --> 00:14:40,959
how do you store them away so like you
 

829
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,790
how do you store them away so like you
went down one branch you're like all

830
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:42,800
went down one branch you're like all
 

831
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,350
went down one branch you're like all
right that's i got that

832
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:45,360
right that's i got that
 

833
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,949
right that's i got that
i understand that that's there's some

834
00:14:46,949 --> 00:14:46,959
i understand that that's there's some
 

835
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,710
i understand that that's there's some
good there there's some bad there now

836
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:48,720
good there there's some bad there now
 

837
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,710
good there there's some bad there now
let me go down another branch like how

838
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:50,720
let me go down another branch like how
 

839
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,550
let me go down another branch like how
do you store away the information you

840
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:52,560
do you store away the information you
 

841
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,389
do you store away the information you
just put on a shelf kind of

842
00:14:54,389 --> 00:14:54,399
just put on a shelf kind of
 

843
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,629
just put on a shelf kind of
i i try and store it away sometimes i

844
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:56,639
i i try and store it away sometimes i
 

845
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,550
i i try and store it away sometimes i
have to sort of repeat it because i

846
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:58,560
have to sort of repeat it because i
 

847
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,230
have to sort of repeat it because i
forget

848
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:00,240
forget
 

849
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,389
forget
and it does happen frequently in games

850
00:15:02,389 --> 00:15:02,399
and it does happen frequently in games
 

851
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,509
and it does happen frequently in games
that

852
00:15:03,509 --> 00:15:03,519
that
 

853
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,030
that
um

854
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:05,040
um
 

855
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,790
um
you're thinking for

856
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:06,800
you're thinking for
 

857
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,470
you're thinking for
especially if you're thinking for long

858
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:08,480
especially if you're thinking for long
 

859
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,790
especially if you're thinking for long
let's say half an hour or even more than

860
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:10,800
let's say half an hour or even more than
 

861
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,189
let's say half an hour or even more than
that that you play a move and then your

862
00:15:13,189 --> 00:15:13,199
that that you play a move and then your
 

863
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,350
that that you play a move and then your
opponent plays a move then you play a

864
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:15,360
opponent plays a move then you play a
 

865
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,269
opponent plays a move then you play a
move and they play a move again and you

866
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:17,279
move and they play a move again and you
 

867
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,550
move and they play a move again and you
realize oh

868
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:18,560
realize oh
 

869
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,629
realize oh
i actually calculated that i just forgot

870
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:20,639
i actually calculated that i just forgot
 

871
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:21,670
i actually calculated that i just forgot
about it

872
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:21,680
about it
 

873
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,310
about it
um so that's obviously what happens when

874
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:24,320
um so that's obviously what happens when
 

875
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,910
um so that's obviously what happens when
you store the information and you cannot

876
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:25,920
you store the information and you cannot
 

877
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,590
you store the information and you cannot
retrieve it when you think about a move

878
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:27,600
retrieve it when you think about a move
 

879
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,069
retrieve it when you think about a move
for 20 30 minutes

880
00:15:30,069 --> 00:15:30,079
for 20 30 minutes
 

881
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:31,829
for 20 30 minutes
like how do you break that down

882
00:15:31,829 --> 00:15:31,839
like how do you break that down
 

883
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,269
like how do you break that down
what can you describe what

884
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:35,279
what can you describe what
 

885
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,790
what can you describe what
like what's the algorithm here that

886
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:36,800
like what's the algorithm here that
 

887
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,629
like what's the algorithm here that
takes 30 minutes to run

888
00:15:38,629 --> 00:15:38,639
takes 30 minutes to run
 

889
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,030
takes 30 minutes to run
30 minutes is uh

890
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:41,040
30 minutes is uh
 

891
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,150
30 minutes is uh
at least for me it's usually a waste um

892
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:44,160
at least for me it's usually a waste um
 

893
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,269
at least for me it's usually a waste um
30 minutes

894
00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:45,279
30 minutes
 

895
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,550
30 minutes
usually means that i don't know what to

896
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:46,560
usually means that i don't know what to
 

897
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,829
usually means that i don't know what to
do

898
00:15:47,829 --> 00:15:47,839
do
 

899
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,189
do
and i'm trying i'm just running into the

900
00:15:49,189 --> 00:15:49,199
and i'm trying i'm just running into the
 

901
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,710
and i'm trying i'm just running into the
wall over here yeah i'm trying to find

902
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:50,720
wall over here yeah i'm trying to find
 

903
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,110
wall over here yeah i'm trying to find
something that isn't there i think

904
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:53,120
something that isn't there i think
 

905
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,990
something that isn't there i think
um 10 to 15 minutes things in

906
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:56,000
um 10 to 15 minutes things in
 

907
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,829
um 10 to 15 minutes things in
complicated positions can be really

908
00:15:57,829 --> 00:15:57,839
complicated positions can be really
 

909
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:58,949
complicated positions can be really
really

910
00:15:58,949 --> 00:15:58,959
really
 

911
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,030
really
uh helpful then you can

912
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:01,040
uh helpful then you can
 

913
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,189
uh helpful then you can
spend your time pretty

914
00:16:03,189 --> 00:16:03,199
spend your time pretty
 

915
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:06,310
spend your time pretty
um efficiently um just

916
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:06,320
um efficiently um just
 

917
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,110
um efficiently um just
it just means that the branches are

918
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:09,120
it just means that the branches are
 

919
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,910
it just means that the branches are
getting getting wider so there's a lot

920
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:11,920
getting getting wider so there's a lot
 

921
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,949
getting getting wider so there's a lot
to

922
00:16:12,949 --> 00:16:12,959
to
 

923
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,310
to
um to run through um both in terms of

924
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:16,320
um to run through um both in terms of
 

925
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,550
um to run through um both in terms of
calculation and a lot you have to

926
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:18,560
calculation and a lot you have to
 

927
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,389
calculation and a lot you have to
evaluate as well and then based on based

928
00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:22,399
evaluate as well and then based on based
 

929
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,430
evaluate as well and then based on based
on that 10 to 15 minutes think you you

930
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:25,440
on that 10 to 15 minutes think you you
 

931
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,389
on that 10 to 15 minutes think you you
have a pretty good idea uh what to

932
00:16:28,389 --> 00:16:28,399
have a pretty good idea uh what to
 

933
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,870
have a pretty good idea uh what to
what to do i mean it's it's very rare

934
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:30,880
what to do i mean it's it's very rare
 

935
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,550
what to do i mean it's it's very rare
that i would think for half an hour and

936
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:32,560
that i would think for half an hour and
 

937
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,870
that i would think for half an hour and
i would have a eureka moment

938
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:34,880
i would have a eureka moment
 

939
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,629
i would have a eureka moment
during the game like if i haven't seen

940
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:36,639
during the game like if i haven't seen
 

941
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,710
during the game like if i haven't seen
it in 10 minutes i'm probably not going

942
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:38,720
it in 10 minutes i'm probably not going
 

943
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,150
it in 10 minutes i'm probably not going
to see it at all you're going to

944
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:40,160
to see it at all you're going to
 

945
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,230
to see it at all you're going to
different branches yeah and like after

946
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:42,240
different branches yeah and like after
 

947
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,150
different branches yeah and like after
15 minutes it's like

948
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:44,160
15 minutes it's like
 

949
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,670
15 minutes it's like
mainly to the middle game because when

950
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:45,680
mainly to the middle game because when
 

951
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,150
mainly to the middle game because when
you get to the end game it's

952
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:48,160
you get to the end game it's
 

953
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,949
you get to the end game it's
usually brute force calculation that

954
00:16:50,949 --> 00:16:50,959
usually brute force calculation that
 

955
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,590
usually brute force calculation that
makes you spend so much time so middle

956
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:53,600
makes you spend so much time so middle
 

957
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,710
makes you spend so much time so middle
game is

958
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:54,720
game is
 

959
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,350
game is
normally it's it's it's a complicated

960
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:57,360
normally it's it's it's a complicated
 

961
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,110
normally it's it's it's a complicated
mix of brute force calculation and and

962
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:01,120
mix of brute force calculation and and
 

963
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,670
mix of brute force calculation and and
uh and um

964
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:03,680
uh and um
 

965
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,710
uh and um
by creativity and evaluation so end game

966
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:06,720
by creativity and evaluation so end game
 

967
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,870
by creativity and evaluation so end game
it's it's it's more it's it's easier in

968
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:08,880
it's it's it's more it's it's easier in
 

969
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,949
it's it's it's more it's it's easier in
that sense well

970
00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:10,959
that sense well
 

971
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,110
that sense well
you're good at

972
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:13,120
you're good at
 

973
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,789
you're good at
every aspect of chess but you're also

974
00:17:14,789 --> 00:17:14,799
every aspect of chess but you're also
 

975
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:17,189
every aspect of chess but you're also
your end game is legendary it baffles

976
00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:17,199
your end game is legendary it baffles
 

977
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,909
your end game is legendary it baffles
experts so uh can you linger on that

978
00:17:19,909 --> 00:17:19,919
experts so uh can you linger on that
 

979
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,590
experts so uh can you linger on that
then try to explain what the heck is

980
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:21,600
then try to explain what the heck is
 

981
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,110
then try to explain what the heck is
going on there like if you look at game

982
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:23,120
going on there like if you look at game
 

983
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,990
going on there like if you look at game
six of the previous world championship

984
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:26,000
six of the previous world championship
 

985
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,230
six of the previous world championship
uh the longest game

986
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:28,240
uh the longest game
 

987
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,350
uh the longest game
ever

988
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:29,360
ever
 

989
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,270
ever
played in chess

990
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:31,280
played in chess
 

991
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,789
played in chess
it was uh

992
00:17:32,789 --> 00:17:32,799
it was uh
 

993
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,070
it was uh
i think

994
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:34,080
i think
 

995
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,510
i think
uh his queen versus your rook knight in

996
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:37,520
uh his queen versus your rook knight in
 

997
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,990
uh his queen versus your rook knight in
two pawns yeah there's so many options

998
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:40,000
two pawns yeah there's so many options
 

999
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,750
two pawns yeah there's so many options
there it's such an interesting little

1000
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:41,760
there it's such an interesting little
 

1001
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,750
there it's such an interesting little
little dance and it's kind of not

1002
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:43,760
little dance and it's kind of not
 

1003
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,270
little dance and it's kind of not
obvious that it wouldn't be a draw so

1004
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:45,280
obvious that it wouldn't be a draw so
 

1005
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,390
obvious that it wouldn't be a draw so
how do you escape

1006
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:46,400
how do you escape
 

1007
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,390
how do you escape
the it not being a draw and you win that

1008
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:48,400
the it not being a draw and you win that
 

1009
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,590
the it not being a draw and you win that
match

1010
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:49,600
match
 

1011
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,270
match
no i knew um that for most of the time

1012
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:53,280
no i knew um that for most of the time
 

1013
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,350
no i knew um that for most of the time
it was a theoretical draw since um

1014
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:57,360
it was a theoretical draw since um
 

1015
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,230
it was a theoretical draw since um
chess with seven or less pieces on the

1016
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:00,240
chess with seven or less pieces on the
 

1017
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,190
chess with seven or less pieces on the
board is solved so you can like people

1018
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:03,200
board is solved so you can like people
 

1019
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,950
board is solved so you can like people
who watching online they can just check

1020
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:04,960
who watching online they can just check
 

1021
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,190
who watching online they can just check
it they can check and

1022
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:07,200
it they can check and
 

1023
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,350
it they can check and
they can check a so-called table base

1024
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:09,360
they can check a so-called table base
 

1025
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,710
they can check a so-called table base
and they it just gonna spit out when for

1026
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:12,720
and they it just gonna spit out when for
 

1027
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,150
and they it just gonna spit out when for
white win for black or a draw so

1028
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:16,160
white win for black or a draw so
 

1029
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,630
white win for black or a draw so
and and also i i knew that i knew that

1030
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:18,640
and and also i i knew that i knew that
 

1031
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,150
and and also i i knew that i knew that
didn't know that

1032
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:20,160
didn't know that
 

1033
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,710
didn't know that
position specifically but i knew that it

1034
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:22,720
position specifically but i knew that it
 

1035
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,630
position specifically but i knew that it
had to be a draw so for me it was

1036
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:26,640
had to be a draw so for me it was
 

1037
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,230
had to be a draw so for me it was
about

1038
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:28,240
about
 

1039
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,590
about
staying alert

1040
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:29,600
staying alert
 

1041
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,029
staying alert
first of all

1042
00:18:31,029 --> 00:18:31,039
first of all
 

1043
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,789
first of all
trying to look for

1044
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:32,799
trying to look for
 

1045
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,990
trying to look for
the best way to put my pieces

1046
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:36,000
the best way to put my pieces
 

1047
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,270
the best way to put my pieces
uh but but

1048
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:37,280
uh but but
 

1049
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,350
uh but but
yeah those end games are a bit

1050
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:39,360
yeah those end games are a bit
 

1051
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,230
yeah those end games are a bit
they're a bit unusual they don't happen

1052
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:42,240
they're a bit unusual they don't happen
 

1053
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,710
they're a bit unusual they don't happen
too often so what i'm usually

1054
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:44,720
too often so what i'm usually
 

1055
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,270
too often so what i'm usually
good at is i'm using my my strengths

1056
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:47,280
good at is i'm using my my strengths
 

1057
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,110
good at is i'm using my my strengths
that i also use in

1058
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:49,120
that i also use in
 

1059
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,990
that i also use in
in middle games is that i

1060
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:52,000
in middle games is that i
 

1061
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,150
in middle games is that i
evaluate well and i calculate short

1062
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:54,160
evaluate well and i calculate short
 

1063
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,590
evaluate well and i calculate short
variations

1064
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:55,600
variations
 

1065
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,510
variations
quite uh even for the end game short

1066
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:57,520
quite uh even for the end game short
 

1067
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,070
quite uh even for the end game short
variations matter yes it does matter in

1068
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:00,080
variations matter yes it does matter in
 

1069
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,710
variations matter yes it does matter in
some simpler end games yeah but also

1070
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:02,720
some simpler end games yeah but also
 

1071
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,669
some simpler end games yeah but also
like

1072
00:19:03,669 --> 00:19:03,679
like
 

1073
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,350
like
there are

1074
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:05,360
there are
 

1075
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,430
there are
these theoretical end games with very

1076
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:07,440
these theoretical end games with very
 

1077
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,870
these theoretical end games with very
few pieces like rook knights and two

1078
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:10,880
few pieces like rook knights and two
 

1079
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,950
few pieces like rook knights and two
pawns versus queens but a lot of end

1080
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:12,960
pawns versus queens but a lot of end
 

1081
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,190
pawns versus queens but a lot of end
games are simply defined by the queens

1082
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:15,200
games are simply defined by the queens
 

1083
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,710
games are simply defined by the queens
being exchanged

1084
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:16,720
being exchanged
 

1085
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,549
being exchanged
and there are a lot of other pieces left

1086
00:19:18,549 --> 00:19:18,559
and there are a lot of other pieces left
 

1087
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,150
and there are a lot of other pieces left
and then

1088
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:20,160
and then
 

1089
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,750
and then
it's usually not brute force it's

1090
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:21,760
it's usually not brute force it's
 

1091
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,029
it's usually not brute force it's
usually

1092
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:23,039
usually
 

1093
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:26,070
usually
more of understanding and evaluation and

1094
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:26,080
more of understanding and evaluation and
 

1095
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,590
more of understanding and evaluation and
then then i can use my my strengths um

1096
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:29,600
then then i can use my my strengths um
 

1097
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,710
then then i can use my my strengths um
very well

1098
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:30,720
very well
 

1099
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,390
very well
why are you so damn good at the end game

1100
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:32,400
why are you so damn good at the end game
 

1101
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,310
why are you so damn good at the end game
isn't there a lot of moves

1102
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:34,320
isn't there a lot of moves
 

1103
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,190
isn't there a lot of moves
from

1104
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:35,200
from
 

1105
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,789
from
when the end game starts to when the end

1106
00:19:36,789 --> 00:19:36,799
when the end game starts to when the end
 

1107
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,470
when the end game starts to when the end
game finishes and you have a few pieces

1108
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:38,480
game finishes and you have a few pieces
 

1109
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,230
game finishes and you have a few pieces
you have to figure out it's like a

1110
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:40,240
you have to figure out it's like a
 

1111
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,710
you have to figure out it's like a
sequence of little games that happens

1112
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:42,720
sequence of little games that happens
 

1113
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,510
sequence of little games that happens
right like little pattern like how how

1114
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:45,520
right like little pattern like how how
 

1115
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,270
right like little pattern like how how
does it being able to evaluate a single

1116
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:47,280
does it being able to evaluate a single
 

1117
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,669
does it being able to evaluate a single
position lead you to

1118
00:19:49,669 --> 00:19:49,679
position lead you to
 

1119
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,750
position lead you to
evaluate a long sequence of positions

1120
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:51,760
evaluate a long sequence of positions
 

1121
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,070
evaluate a long sequence of positions
that eventually lead to a checkmate well

1122
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:54,080
that eventually lead to a checkmate well
 

1123
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,029
that eventually lead to a checkmate well
i think if you evaluate well at the

1124
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:57,039
i think if you evaluate well at the
 

1125
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,669
i think if you evaluate well at the
start you know what plans to go for and

1126
00:19:59,669 --> 00:19:59,679
start you know what plans to go for and
 

1127
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:00,549
start you know what plans to go for and
then

1128
00:20:00,549 --> 00:20:00,559
then
 

1129
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,710
then
usually the play from there is

1130
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:02,720
usually the play from there is
 

1131
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,630
usually the play from there is
is often pretty simple

1132
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:04,640
is often pretty simple
 

1133
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,029
is often pretty simple
let's say you understand

1134
00:20:07,029 --> 00:20:07,039
let's say you understand
 

1135
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,630
let's say you understand
how

1136
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:08,640
how
 

1137
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,510
how
to

1138
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:09,520
to
 

1139
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,990
to
arrange your pieces and

1140
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:12,000
arrange your pieces and
 

1141
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,789
arrange your pieces and
often also how to arrange your pawns

1142
00:20:14,789 --> 00:20:14,799
often also how to arrange your pawns
 

1143
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,549
often also how to arrange your pawns
early in the end game

1144
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:16,559
early in the end game
 

1145
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:17,830
early in the end game
then

1146
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:17,840
then
 

1147
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,110
then
that makes

1148
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:19,120
that makes
 

1149
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,549
that makes
all all the

1150
00:20:20,549 --> 00:20:20,559
all all the
 

1151
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,710
all all the
all the difference and

1152
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:22,720
all the difference and
 

1153
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,430
all the difference and
after that is like what we call

1154
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:25,440
after that is like what we call
 

1155
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,630
after that is like what we call
technique

1156
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:26,640
technique
 

1157
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,350
technique
of very often uh that it's

1158
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:29,360
of very often uh that it's
 

1159
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,110
of very often uh that it's
technique basically just

1160
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:31,120
technique basically just
 

1161
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,789
technique basically just
means that

1162
00:20:32,789 --> 00:20:32,799
means that
 

1163
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,270
means that
the moves are simple and uh

1164
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:35,280
the moves are simple and uh
 

1165
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,190
the moves are simple and uh
these are moves that you know

1166
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:37,200
these are moves that you know
 

1167
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,789
these are moves that you know
a lot of players could

1168
00:20:38,789 --> 00:20:38,799
a lot of players could
 

1169
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,310
a lot of players could
could make not only

1170
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:40,320
could make not only
 

1171
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,230
could make not only
not only the very strongest ones these

1172
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:42,240
not only the very strongest ones these
 

1173
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,909
not only the very strongest ones these
are moves that are kind of

1174
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:43,919
are moves that are kind of
 

1175
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,310
are moves that are kind of
understood and unknown so with the

1176
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:46,320
understood and unknown so with the
 

1177
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,310
understood and unknown so with the
evaluation you're just constantly

1178
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:48,320
evaluation you're just constantly
 

1179
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,669
evaluation you're just constantly
improving a little bit and that just

1180
00:20:49,669 --> 00:20:49,679
improving a little bit and that just
 

1181
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,830
improving a little bit and that just
leads to suffocating the position and

1182
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:51,840
leads to suffocating the position and
 

1183
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,350
leads to suffocating the position and
then eventually to the wind as long as

1184
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:53,360
then eventually to the wind as long as
 

1185
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,350
then eventually to the wind as long as
you're doing the evaluation well

1186
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:55,360
you're doing the evaluation well
 

1187
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,830
you're doing the evaluation well
one step at a time to some extent

1188
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:57,840
one step at a time to some extent
 

1189
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,630
one step at a time to some extent
also yeah as i said like if you evaluate

1190
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:00,640
also yeah as i said like if you evaluate
 

1191
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,070
also yeah as i said like if you evaluate
it better and thus accumulated some

1192
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:04,080
it better and thus accumulated some
 

1193
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,710
it better and thus accumulated some
some small advantages then you can you

1194
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:06,720
some small advantages then you can you
 

1195
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,710
some small advantages then you can you
can often make your

1196
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:08,720
can often make your
 

1197
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,789
can often make your
your your life pretty easy uh towards

1198
00:21:10,789 --> 00:21:10,799
your your life pretty easy uh towards
 

1199
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,950
your your life pretty easy uh towards
the end of the end game so you said in

1200
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:12,960
the end of the end game so you said in
 

1201
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,630
the end of the end game so you said in
uh 2019 sort of the second phase of why

1202
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:16,640
uh 2019 sort of the second phase of why
 

1203
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,230
uh 2019 sort of the second phase of why
you're so damn good

1204
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:18,240
you're so damn good
 

1205
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,830
you're so damn good
you uh you did a lot of opening

1206
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:19,840
you uh you did a lot of opening
 

1207
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,950
you uh you did a lot of opening
preparation

1208
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:20,960
preparation
 

1209
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,630
preparation
what's the goal

1210
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:22,640
what's the goal
 

1211
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,990
what's the goal
for you

1212
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:24,000
for you
 

1213
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,270
for you
of uh the opening game of chess is it to

1214
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:27,280
of uh the opening game of chess is it to
 

1215
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,750
of uh the opening game of chess is it to
throw the opponent off from any prepared

1216
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:29,760
throw the opponent off from any prepared
 

1217
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,870
throw the opponent off from any prepared
lines

1218
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:30,880
lines
 

1219
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,630
lines
is there something you could put into

1220
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:32,640
is there something you could put into
 

1221
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,470
is there something you could put into
words about why you're so damn good at

1222
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:34,480
words about why you're so damn good at
 

1223
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,909
words about why you're so damn good at
the openings

1224
00:21:35,909 --> 00:21:35,919
the openings
 

1225
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,310
the openings
again these things have changed

1226
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:38,320
again these things have changed
 

1227
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,909
again these things have changed
a lot over time

1228
00:21:39,909 --> 00:21:39,919
a lot over time
 

1229
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,630
a lot over time
back in kasparov's days for instance

1230
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:42,640
back in kasparov's days for instance
 

1231
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,590
back in kasparov's days for instance
um he very often got

1232
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:45,600
um he very often got
 

1233
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,230
um he very often got
huge advantages from the opening as

1234
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:48,240
huge advantages from the opening as
 

1235
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,029
huge advantages from the opening as
as white can explain why

1236
00:21:51,029 --> 00:21:51,039
as white can explain why
 

1237
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:52,070
as white can explain why
there were

1238
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:52,080
there were
 

1239
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,870
there were
several reasons for for that first of

1240
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:54,880
several reasons for for that first of
 

1241
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,190
several reasons for for that first of
all he he worked harder he was more

1242
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:57,200
all he he worked harder he was more
 

1243
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,750
all he he worked harder he was more
creative and finding ideas he was able

1244
00:21:59,750 --> 00:21:59,760
creative and finding ideas he was able
 

1245
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,750
creative and finding ideas he was able
to look places others

1246
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:01,760
to look places others
 

1247
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,029
to look places others
didn't

1248
00:22:03,029 --> 00:22:03,039
didn't
 

1249
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,510
didn't
also he had a very strong team of people

1250
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:05,520
also he had a very strong team of people
 

1251
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,710
also he had a very strong team of people
who had

1252
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:06,720
who had
 

1253
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,950
who had
specific strengths in

1254
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:08,960
specific strengths in
 

1255
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,590
specific strengths in
in openings that he could use

1256
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:11,600
in openings that he could use
 

1257
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,190
in openings that he could use
so they would come up with ideas and he

1258
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:13,200
so they would come up with ideas and he
 

1259
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,270
so they would come up with ideas and he
would he would integrate those ideas

1260
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:15,280
would he would integrate those ideas
 

1261
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,190
would he would integrate those ideas
into yeah and he would also very often

1262
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:17,200
into yeah and he would also very often
 

1263
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,870
into yeah and he would also very often
come up with them them himself also

1264
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:20,880
come up with them them himself also
 

1265
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,470
come up with them them himself also
at the start

1266
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:22,480
at the start
 

1267
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,549
at the start
he had

1268
00:22:24,549 --> 00:22:24,559
he had
 

1269
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:27,750
he had
some of the first computer engines to to

1270
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:27,760
some of the first computer engines to to
 

1271
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,070
some of the first computer engines to to
work um for him to

1272
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:30,080
work um for him to
 

1273
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,390
work um for him to
define his ideas to look deeper to

1274
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:32,400
define his ideas to look deeper to
 

1275
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,430
define his ideas to look deeper to
verify as ideas he was better at using

1276
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:35,440
verify as ideas he was better at using
 

1277
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,110
verify as ideas he was better at using
them

1278
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:37,120
them
 

1279
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,190
them
than a lot of others

1280
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:39,200
than a lot of others
 

1281
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,510
than a lot of others
now i feel like the

1282
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:41,520
now i feel like the
 

1283
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,510
now i feel like the
playing field is a lot more

1284
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:43,520
playing field is a lot more
 

1285
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,510
playing field is a lot more
level there are

1286
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:45,520
level there are
 

1287
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,870
level there are
both computer engines neural networks

1288
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:48,880
both computer engines neural networks
 

1289
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,990
both computer engines neural networks
and hybrid engines available to

1290
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:52,000
and hybrid engines available to
 

1291
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,110
and hybrid engines available to
practically

1292
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:53,120
practically
 

1293
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,710
practically
anybody so it's it's much harder to

1294
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:56,720
anybody so it's it's much harder to
 

1295
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,470
anybody so it's it's much harder to
find ideas

1296
00:22:58,470 --> 00:22:58,480
find ideas
 

1297
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,029
find ideas
now that um

1298
00:23:01,029 --> 00:23:01,039
now that um
 

1299
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,190
now that um
that actually like give you an advantage

1300
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:03,200
that actually like give you an advantage
 

1301
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,510
that actually like give you an advantage
with what the the white pieces i mean

1302
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:05,520
with what the the white pieces i mean
 

1303
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,590
with what the the white pieces i mean
people don't expect to find those ideas

1304
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:07,600
people don't expect to find those ideas
 

1305
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,470
people don't expect to find those ideas
anymore now it's all about

1306
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:10,480
anymore now it's all about
 

1307
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,950
anymore now it's all about
finding ideas that

1308
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:12,960
finding ideas that
 

1309
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,110
finding ideas that
are missed by the

1310
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:15,120
are missed by the
 

1311
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,070
are missed by the
engines either they're missed

1312
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:18,080
engines either they're missed
 

1313
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,230
engines either they're missed
entirely or they're missed at low depth

1314
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:22,240
entirely or they're missed at low depth
 

1315
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,549
entirely or they're missed at low depth
and using them to

1316
00:23:24,549 --> 00:23:24,559
and using them to
 

1317
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,149
and using them to
you know gain some advantage in the

1318
00:23:26,149 --> 00:23:26,159
you know gain some advantage in the
 

1319
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,390
you know gain some advantage in the
sense that you have more more knowledge

1320
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:28,400
sense that you have more more knowledge
 

1321
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,909
sense that you have more more knowledge
and

1322
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:29,919
and
 

1323
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:31,510
and
you know it's also

1324
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:31,520
you know it's also
 

1325
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,470
you know it's also
good to know that usually

1326
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:34,480
good to know that usually
 

1327
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,310
good to know that usually
these are not complete bluffs these are

1328
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:36,320
these are not complete bluffs these are
 

1329
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,549
these are not complete bluffs these are
like semi bluffs so that you know that

1330
00:23:38,549 --> 00:23:38,559
like semi bluffs so that you know that
 

1331
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:39,990
like semi bluffs so that you know that
even if your opponent makes all the

1332
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:40,000
even if your opponent makes all the
 

1333
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,750
even if your opponent makes all the
right moves you can still

1334
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:41,760
right moves you can still
 

1335
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,190
right moves you can still
make a draw

1336
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:43,200
make a draw
 

1337
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,870
make a draw
and also at the start of 2019

1338
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:46,880
and also at the start of 2019
 

1339
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,950
and also at the start of 2019
neural networks had just started to be a

1340
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:48,960
neural networks had just started to be a
 

1341
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,669
neural networks had just started to be a
thing in in chess and uh

1342
00:23:51,669 --> 00:23:51,679
thing in in chess and uh
 

1343
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,510
thing in in chess and uh
i'm not entirely sure but there were at

1344
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:53,520
i'm not entirely sure but there were at
 

1345
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,590
i'm not entirely sure but there were at
least some players

1346
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:55,600
least some players
 

1347
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,310
least some players
in

1348
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:56,320
in
 

1349
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,390
in
even in the top events you who you could

1350
00:23:58,390 --> 00:23:58,400
even in the top events you who you could
 

1351
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,110
even in the top events you who you could
see did not use them or did not use them

1352
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:01,120
see did not use them or did not use them
 

1353
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,750
see did not use them or did not use them
in the right way and then you could gain

1354
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:03,760
in the right way and then you could gain
 

1355
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,909
in the right way and then you could gain
a huge advantage because a lot of

1356
00:24:05,909 --> 00:24:05,919
a huge advantage because a lot of
 

1357
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:07,909
a huge advantage because a lot of
positions they were

1358
00:24:07,909 --> 00:24:07,919
positions they were
 

1359
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:09,590
positions they were
being evaluated differently by the

1360
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:09,600
being evaluated differently by the
 

1361
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,669
being evaluated differently by the
neural networks than traditional chess

1362
00:24:11,669 --> 00:24:11,679
neural networks than traditional chess
 

1363
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:12,950
neural networks than traditional chess
engines

1364
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:12,960
engines
 

1365
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,830
engines
because they simply think about chess in

1366
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:15,840
because they simply think about chess in
 

1367
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,750
because they simply think about chess in
a very very

1368
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:17,760
a very very
 

1369
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,990
a very very
different way so

1370
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:20,000
different way so
 

1371
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,310
different way so
short answer is these days it's all

1372
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:22,320
short answer is these days it's all
 

1373
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,990
short answer is these days it's all
about surprising your your opponent and

1374
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:26,000
about surprising your your opponent and
 

1375
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,830
about surprising your your opponent and
taking it into position where you have

1376
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:27,840
taking it into position where you have
 

1377
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,630
taking it into position where you have
more more knowledge so is there some

1378
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:30,640
more more knowledge so is there some
 

1379
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,149
more more knowledge so is there some
sense in which it's okay to make

1380
00:24:32,149 --> 00:24:32,159
sense in which it's okay to make
 

1381
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:34,950
sense in which it's okay to make
suboptimal quote-unquote moves no but

1382
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:34,960
suboptimal quote-unquote moves no but
 

1383
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,070
suboptimal quote-unquote moves no but
you have to

1384
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:36,080
you have to
 

1385
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,909
you have to
i mean you you have to

1386
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:37,919
i mean you you have to
 

1387
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:39,990
i mean you you have to
because the best moves have been

1388
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:40,000
because the best moves have been
 

1389
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,950
because the best moves have been
analyzed to to death mostly so that's a

1390
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:42,960
analyzed to to death mostly so that's a
 

1391
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,789
analyzed to to death mostly so that's a
kind of when you say sami bluff that's a

1392
00:24:44,789 --> 00:24:44,799
kind of when you say sami bluff that's a
 

1393
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,470
kind of when you say sami bluff that's a
kind of sacrifice

1394
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:46,480
kind of sacrifice
 

1395
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,430
kind of sacrifice
you're you're sacrificing the optimal

1396
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:49,440
you're you're sacrificing the optimal
 

1397
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,070
you're you're sacrificing the optimal
move the optimal position

1398
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:52,080
move the optimal position
 

1399
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,990
move the optimal position
so that you can take the opponent i mean

1400
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:54,000
so that you can take the opponent i mean
 

1401
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,070
so that you can take the opponent i mean
that's the game theoretics yes you take

1402
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:56,080
that's the game theoretics yes you take
 

1403
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,909
that's the game theoretics yes you take
the opponent into something they didn't

1404
00:24:57,909 --> 00:24:57,919
the opponent into something they didn't
 

1405
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,149
the opponent into something they didn't
prepare well yeah but you could also

1406
00:25:00,149 --> 00:25:00,159
prepare well yeah but you could also
 

1407
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:02,390
prepare well yeah but you could also
look at it another way

1408
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:02,400
look at it another way
 

1409
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,070
look at it another way
that

1410
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:04,080
that
 

1411
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,470
that
regardless like if you turn on

1412
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:06,480
regardless like if you turn on
 

1413
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,470
regardless like if you turn on
whatever engine you turn on like if you

1414
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:08,480
whatever engine you turn on like if you
 

1415
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,390
whatever engine you turn on like if you
try to analyze either from

1416
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:10,400
try to analyze either from
 

1417
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,149
try to analyze either from
the starting position or the starting

1418
00:25:12,149 --> 00:25:12,159
the starting position or the starting
 

1419
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:14,950
the starting position or the starting
position of some popular opening

1420
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:14,960
position of some popular opening
 

1421
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,510
position of some popular opening
like if you um analyze long enough it's

1422
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:17,520
like if you um analyze long enough it's
 

1423
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,350
like if you um analyze long enough it's
always going to end up in a draw

1424
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:19,360
always going to end up in a draw
 

1425
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,230
always going to end up in a draw
so

1426
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:20,240
so
 

1427
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,029
so
in in that sense you may not be going

1428
00:25:23,029 --> 00:25:23,039
in in that sense you may not be going
 

1429
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,269
in in that sense you may not be going
for like the objective

1430
00:25:25,269 --> 00:25:25,279
for like the objective
 

1431
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:26,789
for like the objective
the tries that are

1432
00:25:26,789 --> 00:25:26,799
the tries that are
 

1433
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,710
the tries that are
objectively the most difficult to draw

1434
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:28,720
objectively the most difficult to draw
 

1435
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,669
objectively the most difficult to draw
against

1436
00:25:29,669 --> 00:25:29,679
against
 

1437
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:31,990
against
but you know you are trying to look at

00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:32,000
but you know you are trying to look at
 

1439
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,430
but you know you are trying to look at
least at the less obvious um paths okay

1440
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:35,440
least at the less obvious um paths okay
 

1441
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,909
least at the less obvious um paths okay
how much do you use engines do you use

1442
00:25:37,909 --> 00:25:37,919
how much do you use engines do you use

in your preparations my team does

1448
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:43,520
in your preparations my team does
 

1449
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,710
in your preparations my team does
personally i try not to use them too

1450
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:46,720
personally i try not to use them too
 

1451
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,830
personally i try not to use them too
much

1452
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:47,840
much
 

1453
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,870
much
on on my own uh because i know that when

1454
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:50,880
on on my own uh because i know that when
 

1455
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,350
on on my own uh because i know that when
i play you can obviously cannot have

1456
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:53,360
i play you can obviously cannot have
 

1457
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,669
i play you can obviously cannot have
help from from engines and

1458
00:25:55,669 --> 00:25:55,679
help from from engines and
 

1459
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,470
help from from engines and
often i feel like often having

1460
00:25:58,470 --> 00:25:58,480
often i feel like often having
 

1461
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,870
often i feel like often having
imperfect

1462
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:00,880
imperfect
 

1463
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,149
imperfect
or knowledge about a position uh or some

1464
00:26:04,149 --> 00:26:04,159
or knowledge about a position uh or some
 

1465
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:07,190
or knowledge about a position uh or some
engine knowledge can be a lot worse than

1466
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:07,200
engine knowledge can be a lot worse than
 

1467
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,029
engine knowledge can be a lot worse than
than having no knowledge

1468
00:26:09,029 --> 00:26:09,039
than having no knowledge
 

1469
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:12,070
than having no knowledge
uh so i try to look at engines as little

1470
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:12,080
uh so i try to look at engines as little
 

1471
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,269
uh so i try to look at engines as little
as possible

1472
00:26:13,269 --> 00:26:13,279
as possible
 

1473
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,269
as possible
so yeah so your team uses them for

1474
00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:15,279
so yeah so your team uses them for
 

1475
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:17,510
so yeah so your team uses them for
research for a generation of ideas yeah

1476
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:17,520
research for a generation of ideas yeah
 

1477
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,110
research for a generation of ideas yeah
but you are

1478
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:19,120
but you are
 

1479
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,909
but you are
uh relying primarily on your human

1480
00:26:21,909 --> 00:26:21,919
uh relying primarily on your human
 

1481
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:23,510
uh relying primarily on your human
resources

1482
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:23,520

it's
 

1495
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,190
it's
very often the case

1496
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:37,200
very often the case
 

1497
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,190
very often the case
for me to some extent but

1498
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:39,200
for me to some extent but
 

1499
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,269
for me to some extent but
a lot for for others that you arrive in

1500
00:26:41,269 --> 00:26:41,279
a lot for for others that you arrive in
 

1501
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,269
a lot for for others that you arrive in
a position

1502
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:43,279
a position
 

1503
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,190
a position
and your opponent plays a move that you

1504
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:45,200
and your opponent plays a move that you
 

1505
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,909
and your opponent plays a move that you
didn't expect and

1506
00:26:47,909 --> 00:26:47,919
didn't expect and
 

1507
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:49,510
didn't expect and
you know if you didn't expect it you

1508
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:49,520
you know if you didn't expect it you
 

1509
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,750
you know if you didn't expect it you
know that it's probably not a great move

1510
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:51,760
know that it's probably not a great move
 

1511
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,590
know that it's probably not a great move
since it hasn't been expected by by the

1512
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:53,600
since it hasn't been expected by by the
 

1513
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,350
since it hasn't been expected by by the
engine but

1514
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:55,360
engine but
 

1515
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,950
engine but
if it's not

1516
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:56,960
if it's not
 

1517
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,590
if it's not
if it's not obvious why it's not a good

1518
00:26:59,590 --> 00:26:59,600
if it's not obvious why it's not a good
 

1519
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,549
if it's not obvious why it's not a good
move

1520
00:27:00,549 --> 00:27:00,559
move
 

1521
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,630
move
it's usually very very hard to figure it

1522
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:02,640
it's usually very very hard to figure it
 

1523
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,750
it's usually very very hard to figure it
out

1524
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:03,760
out
 

1525
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,750
out
and so then

1526
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:05,760
and so then
 

1527
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,269
and so then
looking at the engines doesn't

1528
00:27:07,269 --> 00:27:07,279
looking at the engines doesn't
 

1529
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:09,269
looking at the engines doesn't
necessarily help because at that point

1530
00:27:09,269 --> 00:27:09,279
necessarily help because at that point
 

1531
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,669
necessarily help because at that point

before i
 

1581
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,310
before i
entered top level chess um so that's

1582

entered top level chess um so that's
 

1583
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,110
entered top level chess um so that's
never been an issue uh for me i never

1584
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:11,120
never been an issue uh for me i never

much anyway so so that's completely fine

1588
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:16,000
much anyway so so that's completely fine
 

1589
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,110
much anyway so so that's completely fine
but it was amazing to see uh how

1590
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:19,120
but it was amazing to see uh how
 

1591
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,269
but it was amazing to see uh how
they quote-unquote thought about chess

00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:24,230
they quote-unquote thought about chess
and in such a different way and in a way

1595
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,350
and in such a different way and in a way
that you could

1596
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:25,360
that you could
 

1597
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,510
that you could
mistake for creativity

1598
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:27,520
mistake for creativity
 

1599
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,630
mistake for creativity
mistake for cr strong words uh is it

1600
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:30,640
mistake for cr strong words uh is it
 

1601
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,549

pieces and then wait for prolonged

1606
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:36,480
pieces and then wait for prolonged
 

1607
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,070

periods of time before doing anything

1608
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:38,080
periods of time before doing anything
 

1609
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,830
periods of time before doing anything
with that is that

1610
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:39,840
with that is that
 

1611
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,750
with that is that
is that weird to you that that's part of

is that weird to you that that's part of
 

1613

00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:15,200
like very concrete
 

1645
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,070
like very concrete
uh positional advantage this sort of

1646
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:18,080
uh positional advantage this sort of
 

1647
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,389
uh positional advantage this sort of
compensates for it

1648
00:29:20,389 --> 00:29:20,399
compensates for it
 

1649
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,070
compensates for it
for instance

1650
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:22,080
for instance
 

1651
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,149
for instance
in chess so bishops and knights are

1652
00:29:24,149 --> 00:29:24,159
in chess so bishops and knights are
 

1653
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:26,630
in chess so bishops and knights are
fairly equivalent

1654
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:26,640
fairly equivalent
 

1655
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,549
fairly equivalent
we both give them three points but

1656
00:29:28,549 --> 00:29:28,559
we both give them three points but
 

1657
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,389
we both give them three points but
bishops are a little bit better and

1658
00:29:30,389 --> 00:29:30,399
bishops are a little bit better and
 

1659
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:33,269
bishops are a little bit better and
especially a bishop pair is a lot better

1660
00:29:33,269 --> 00:29:33,279
especially a bishop pair is a lot better
 

1661
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:34,310
especially a bishop pair is a lot better
than

1662
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:34,320
than
 

1663
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,029
than
than a bishop and a knight so or

1664
00:29:37,029 --> 00:29:37,039
than a bishop and a knight so or
 

1665
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:39,029
than a bishop and a knight so or
especially two knights

1666
00:29:39,029 --> 00:29:39,039
especially two knights
 

1667
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:41,350
especially two knights
depends on the position but

1668
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:41,360
depends on the position but
 

1669
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,630
depends on the position but
like

1670
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:42,640
like
 

1671
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,269
like
on average they are so like

1672
00:29:45,269 --> 00:29:45,279
on average they are so like
 

1673
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:48,149
on average they are so like
sacrificing a pawn in order to get

1674
00:29:48,149 --> 00:29:48,159
sacrificing a pawn in order to get
 

1675
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,789
sacrificing a pawn in order to get
get a bishop pair that's one of the most

1676
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:50,799
get a bishop pair that's one of the most
 

1677
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:52,789
get a bishop pair that's one of the most
common sacrifices in general you're okay

1678
00:29:52,789 --> 00:29:52,799
common sacrifices in general you're okay
 

1679
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,630
common sacrifices in general you're okay
making a second yeah i mean it depends

1680
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:54,640
making a second yeah i mean it depends
 

1681
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,310
making a second yeah i mean it depends
on the situation but

1682
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:56,320
on the situation but
 

1683
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,830
on the situation but
generally that's fine and there are a

1684
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:57,840
generally that's fine and there are a
 

1685
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,830
generally that's fine and there are a
lot of openings that are based on that

1686
00:29:59,830 --> 00:29:59,840
lot of openings that are based on that
 

1687
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,669
lot of openings that are based on that
that you sacrifice

1688
00:30:01,669 --> 00:30:01,679
that you sacrifice
 

1689
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:03,669
that you sacrifice
upon for the bishop pair and then

1690
00:30:03,669 --> 00:30:03,679
upon for the bishop pair and then
 

1691
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:05,590
upon for the bishop pair and then
eventually it's some sort of positional

1692
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:05,600
eventually it's some sort of positional
 

1693
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,269
eventually it's some sort of positional
equality um

1694
00:30:07,269 --> 00:30:07,279
equality um
 

1695
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:09,830
equality um
so that's fine but um

1696
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:09,840
so that's fine but um
 

1697
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,549
so that's fine but um
the way alpha zero would

1698
00:30:12,549 --> 00:30:12,559
the way alpha zero would
 

1699
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:15,830
the way alpha zero would
would sacrifice a knight or sometimes

1700
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:15,840
would sacrifice a knight or sometimes
 

1701
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,230
would sacrifice a knight or sometimes
two pawns three pawns

1702
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:18,240
two pawns three pawns
 

1703
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,070
two pawns three pawns
and you could see that it's looking for

1704
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:20,080
and you could see that it's looking for
 

1705
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,990
and you could see that it's looking for
some sort of positional domination but

1706
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:22,000
some sort of positional domination but
 

1707
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,029
some sort of positional domination but
it's

1708
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:23,039
it's
 

1709
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,110
it's
it's hard to understand and it's um it

1710
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:25,120
it's hard to understand and it's um it
 

1711
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,149
it's hard to understand and it's um it
was

1712
00:30:26,149 --> 00:30:26,159
was
 

1713
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:28,630
was
really fascinating to see um

1714
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:28,640
really fascinating to see um
 

1715
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,549
really fascinating to see um
yeah in 2019 i was sacrificing a lot of

1716
00:30:32,549 --> 00:30:32,559
yeah in 2019 i was sacrificing a lot of
 

1717
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:35,110
yeah in 2019 i was sacrificing a lot of
a lot of puns especially and it was

1718
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:35,120
a lot of puns especially and it was
 

1719
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,470
a lot of puns especially and it was
it was a great joy

1720
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:36,480
it was a great joy
 

1721
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,789
it was a great joy
unfortunately it's not so easy to

1722
00:30:38,789 --> 00:30:38,799
unfortunately it's not so easy to
 

1723
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:41,110
unfortunately it's not so easy to
continue to do that people

1724
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:41,120
continue to do that people
 

1725
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,029
continue to do that people
people have found

1726
00:30:43,029 --> 00:30:43,039
people have found
 

1727
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:45,750
people have found
more solid opening lines since that

1728
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:45,760
more solid opening lines since that
 

1729
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,630
more solid opening lines since that
don't allow me to to do that as often

1730
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:48,640
don't allow me to to do that as often
 

1731
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,389
don't allow me to to do that as often
i'm still trying both to get those

1732
00:30:50,389 --> 00:30:50,399
i'm still trying both to get those
 

1733
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,950
i'm still trying both to get those
positions and still trying to

1734
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:52,960
positions and still trying to
 

1735
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,510
positions and still trying to
to learn the art of of sacrificing

1736
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:55,520
to learn the art of of sacrificing
 

1737
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,470
to learn the art of of sacrificing
pieces

1738
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:56,480
pieces
 

1739
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,190
pieces
so

1740
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:57,200
so
 

1741
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,110
so
uh demis also

1742
00:30:59,110 --> 00:30:59,120
uh demis also
 

1743
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,190
uh demis also
made a comment that was interesting to

1744
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:01,200
made a comment that was interesting to
 

1745
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,909
made a comment that was interesting to
my newb chess brain which is one of the

1746
00:31:03,909 --> 00:31:03,919
my newb chess brain which is one of the
 

1747
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:05,990
my newb chess brain which is one of the
reasons that chess is fun is because of

1748
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:06,000
reasons that chess is fun is because of
 

1749
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,909
reasons that chess is fun is because of
the quote creative tension between the

1750
00:31:07,909 --> 00:31:07,919
the quote creative tension between the
 

1751
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:09,909
the quote creative tension between the
bishop and the knight so you're talking

1752
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:09,919
bishop and the knight so you're talking
 

1753
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:11,110
bishop and the knight so you're talking
about this

1754
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:11,120
about this
 

1755
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,870
about this
interesting um

1756
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:12,880
interesting um
 

1757
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,710
interesting um
difference between two pieces that

1758
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:14,720
difference between two pieces that
 

1759
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,310
difference between two pieces that
there's some kind of

1760
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:16,320
there's some kind of
 

1761
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,909
there's some kind of
how would you convert that i mean that's

1762
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:17,919
how would you convert that i mean that's
 

1763
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:20,310
how would you convert that i mean that's
like a poetic statement about chess

1764
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:20,320
like a poetic statement about chess
 

1765
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,470
like a poetic statement about chess
i think he said that why has chess been

1766
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:22,480
i think he said that why has chess been
 

1767
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,470
i think he said that why has chess been
played for such a long time why is it so

1768
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:24,480
played for such a long time why is it so
 

1769
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,110
played for such a long time why is it so
fun to play at every level that if you

1770
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:27,120
fun to play at every level that if you
 

1771
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,350
fun to play at every level that if you
can reduce it to one thing is is it's

1772
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:29,360
can reduce it to one thing is is it's
 

1773
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,389
can reduce it to one thing is is it's
the bishop

1774
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:30,399
the bishop
 

1775
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:32,470
the bishop
and the knight some kind of weird

1776
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:32,480
and the knight some kind of weird
 

1777
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,310
and the knight some kind of weird
dynamics that they create in chess is

1778
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:34,320
dynamics that they create in chess is
 

1779
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,310
dynamics that they create in chess is
there any truth to that

1780
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:36,320
there any truth to that
 

1781
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,149
there any truth to that
it sounds very good

1782
00:31:38,149 --> 00:31:38,159
it sounds very good
 

1783
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,950
it sounds very good
i haven't tried a lot of other games but

1784
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:40,960
i haven't tried a lot of other games but
 

1785
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,350
i haven't tried a lot of other games but
i tried to play a little bit of shogi

1786
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:43,360
i tried to play a little bit of shogi
 

1787
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,230
i tried to play a little bit of shogi
and

1788
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:44,240
and
 

1789
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,509
and
for my noob shogi brain um comparing it

1790
00:31:47,509 --> 00:31:47,519
for my noob shogi brain um comparing it
 

1791
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:49,669
for my noob shogi brain um comparing it
to chess what annoyed me about that game

1792
00:31:49,669 --> 00:31:49,679
to chess what annoyed me about that game
 

1793
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:51,269
to chess what annoyed me about that game
is how much

1794
00:31:51,269 --> 00:31:51,279
is how much
 

1795
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:52,870
is how much
the pieces suck

1796
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:52,880
the pieces suck
 

1797
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,710
the pieces suck
basically you have one rook and you have

1798
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:54,720
basically you have one rook and you have
 

1799
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,789
basically you have one rook and you have
one bishop that move like in chess and

1800
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:56,799
one bishop that move like in chess and
 

1801
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:00,149
one bishop that move like in chess and
the rest of the pieces are really

1802
00:32:00,149 --> 00:32:00,159
the rest of the pieces are really
 

1803
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:02,630
the rest of the pieces are really
not very powerful so i think that's one

1804
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:02,640
not very powerful so i think that's one
 

1805
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,310
not very powerful so i think that's one
of the

1806
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:04,320
of the
 

1807
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,950
of the
attractions of chess like how powerful

1808
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:06,960
attractions of chess like how powerful
 

1809
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,950
attractions of chess like how powerful
especially the queen

1810
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:08,960
especially the queen
 

1811
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,830
especially the queen
is

1812
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:09,840
is
 

1813
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,029
is
which interesting i kind of think makes

1814
00:32:13,029 --> 00:32:13,039
which interesting i kind of think makes
 

1815
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:15,669
which interesting i kind of think makes
it makes a lot of fun see you you think

1816
00:32:15,669 --> 00:32:15,679
it makes a lot of fun see you you think
 

1817
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:16,789
it makes a lot of fun see you you think
power

1818
00:32:16,789 --> 00:32:16,799
power
 

1819
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:18,470
power
is more fun

1820
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:18,480
is more fun
 

1821
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,230
is more fun
than like variety

1822
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:20,240
than like variety
 

1823
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,630
than like variety
no there is variety in chess as well

1824
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:22,640
no there is variety in chess as well
 

1825
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,509
no there is variety in chess as well
though just but not much more so than

1826
00:32:25,509 --> 00:32:25,519
though just but not much more so than
 

1827
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:26,389
though just but not much more so than
like

1828
00:32:26,389 --> 00:32:26,399
like
 

1829
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:31,110
like
like no no

1830
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:31,120

 

1831
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,549

they all move in different ways they're

1832
00:32:32,549 --> 00:32:32,559
they all move in different ways they're
 

1833
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:33,909
they all move in different ways they're
all like weird

1834
00:32:33,909 --> 00:32:33,919
all like weird
 

1835
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:35,669
all like weird
there's just all these weird patterns

1836
00:32:35,669 --> 00:32:35,679
there's just all these weird patterns
 

1837
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:37,430
there's just all these weird patterns
and positions that can emerge the

1838
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:37,440
and positions that can emerge the
 

1839
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,190
and positions that can emerge the
difference in the pieces create all

1840
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:39,200
difference in the pieces create all
 

1841
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,710
difference in the pieces create all
kinds of interesting dynamics i guess is

1842
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:40,720
kinds of interesting dynamics i guess is
 

1843
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,190
kinds of interesting dynamics i guess is
what i'm trying to say yeah and i guess

1844
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:43,200
what i'm trying to say yeah and i guess
 

1845
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,909
what i'm trying to say yeah and i guess
it is quite fascinating that

1846
00:32:45,909 --> 00:32:45,919
it is quite fascinating that
 

1847
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:48,549
it is quite fascinating that
all those years ago they created

1848
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:48,559
all those years ago they created
 

1849
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,310
all those years ago they created
the knight and the bishop

1850
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:50,320
the knight and the bishop
 

1851
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,310
the knight and the bishop
without probably realizing that they

1852
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:52,320
without probably realizing that they
 

1853
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,590
without probably realizing that they
would be

1854
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:53,600
would be
 

1855
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,470
would be
almost equally equally strong with such

1856
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:56,480
almost equally equally strong with such
 

1857
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,310
almost equally equally strong with such
different qualities yeah it's crazy that

1858
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:58,320
different qualities yeah it's crazy that
 

1859
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,389
different qualities yeah it's crazy that
this you know the like when you design

1860
00:33:00,389 --> 00:33:00,399
this you know the like when you design
 

1861
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:01,909
this you know the like when you design
computer games

1862
00:33:01,909 --> 00:33:01,919
computer games
 

1863
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:03,909
computer games
it's it's like an art form it's science

1864
00:33:03,909 --> 00:33:03,919
it's it's like an art form it's science
 

1865
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:06,310
it's it's like an art form it's science
and an art to to balance it you know you

1866
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:06,320
and an art to to balance it you know you
 

1867
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,269
and an art to to balance it you know you
talk about starcraft and all those games

1868
00:33:09,269 --> 00:33:09,279
talk about starcraft and all those games
 

1869
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:11,590
talk about starcraft and all those games
like so that you can have competitive

1870
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:11,600
like so that you can have competitive
 

1871
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,590
like so that you can have competitive
play at the highest level

1872
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:13,600
play at the highest level
 

1873
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,990
play at the highest level
with all those different units and

1874
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:16,000
with all those different units and
 

1875
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,070
with all those different units and
in in case of chess it's different

1876
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:18,080
in in case of chess it's different
 

1877
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,110
in in case of chess it's different
pieces

1878
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:19,120
pieces
 

1879
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,430
pieces
and they somehow designed a game that

1880
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:21,440
and they somehow designed a game that
 

1881
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,870
and they somehow designed a game that
was super competitive but there's

1882
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:22,880
was super competitive but there's
 

1883
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,389
was super competitive but there's
probably some kind of natural selection

1884
00:33:24,389 --> 00:33:24,399
probably some kind of natural selection
 

1885
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,310
probably some kind of natural selection
that the chest just wouldn't last if it

1886
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:26,320
that the chest just wouldn't last if it
 

1887
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,789
that the chest just wouldn't last if it
was designed poorly yeah and i think the

1888
00:33:28,789 --> 00:33:28,799
was designed poorly yeah and i think the
 

1889
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:31,269
was designed poorly yeah and i think the
the rules have changed

1890
00:33:31,269 --> 00:33:31,279
the rules have changed
 

1891
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:33,990
the rules have changed
over time a little little bit

1892
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:34,000
over time a little little bit
 

1893
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,389
over time a little little bit
but i would be i mean speaking of games

1894
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:36,399
but i would be i mean speaking of games
 

1895
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:38,870
but i would be i mean speaking of games
and all that i'm also

1896
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:38,880
and all that i'm also
 

1897
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,789
and all that i'm also
interested to play

1898
00:33:40,789 --> 00:33:40,799
interested to play
 

1899
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:41,669
interested to play
other

1900
00:33:41,669 --> 00:33:41,679
other
 

1901
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:43,110
other
other games like

1902
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:43,120
other games like
 

1903
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,750
other games like
chess 960 or fisher random as they call

1904
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:45,760
chess 960 or fisher random as they call
 

1905
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:49,110
chess 960 or fisher random as they call
it like that you have 960 maps instead

1906
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:49,120
it like that you have 960 maps instead
 

1907
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,389
it like that you have 960 maps instead
of one

1908
00:33:50,389 --> 00:33:50,399
of one
 

1909
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:52,389
of one
yeah so for people who don't know a

1910
00:33:52,389 --> 00:33:52,399
yeah so for people who don't know a
 

1911
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:55,029
yeah so for people who don't know a
fisher random chest chest 960s yeah that

1912
00:33:55,029 --> 00:33:55,039
fisher random chest chest 960s yeah that
 

1913
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:56,789
fisher random chest chest 960s yeah that
basically just means that the pawns are

1914
00:33:56,789 --> 00:33:56,799
basically just means that the pawns are
 

1915
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:58,630
basically just means that the pawns are
in the same way and

1916
00:33:58,630 --> 00:33:58,640
in the same way and
 

1917
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,350
in the same way and
the major pieces are

1918
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:01,360
the major pieces are
 

1919
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,509
the major pieces are
uh distributed randomly on the on the

1920
00:34:03,509 --> 00:34:03,519
uh distributed randomly on the on the
 

1921
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:05,909
uh distributed randomly on the on the
last rank only that there have to be

1922
00:34:05,909 --> 00:34:05,919
last rank only that there have to be
 

1923
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:08,230
last rank only that there have to be
obviously bishops of opposite color and

1924
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:08,240
obviously bishops of opposite color and
 

1925
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,230
obviously bishops of opposite color and
the king has to be in between the rooks

1926
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:10,240
the king has to be in between the rooks
 

1927
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,550
the king has to be in between the rooks
so that you can castle both ways oh you

1928
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:12,560
so that you can castle both ways oh you
 

1929
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,470
so that you can castle both ways oh you
can still castle and you can still

1930
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:14,480
can still castle and you can still
 

1931
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,270
can still castle and you can still
castle but it makes it interesting so

1932
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:17,280
castle but it makes it interesting so
 

1933
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,629
castle but it makes it interesting so
you still have

1934
00:34:18,629 --> 00:34:18,639
you still have
 

1935
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,629
you still have
it still castles in the same way so

1936
00:34:20,629 --> 00:34:20,639
it still castles in the same way so
 

1937
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,869
it still castles in the same way so
let's say the king is like

1938
00:34:22,869 --> 00:34:22,879
let's say the king is like
 

1939
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:24,710
let's say the king is like
yeah what happens in that case yeah like

1940
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:24,720
yeah what happens in that case yeah like
 

1941
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,950
yeah what happens in that case yeah like
let's say the king is in the corner

1942
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:26,960
let's say the king is in the corner
 

1943
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,990
let's say the king is in the corner
um

1944
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:28,000
um
 

1945
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,310
um
so to to castle this side you have you

1946
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:30,320
so to to castle this side you have you
 

1947
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:35,190
so to to castle this side you have you
have to clear a whole lot of pieces

1948
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:35,200

 

1949
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,869

no the king would go here and the rook

1950
00:34:36,869 --> 00:34:36,879
no the king would go here and the rook
 

1951
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:40,149
no the king would go here and the rook
would go there oh okay um and that's

1952
00:34:40,149 --> 00:34:40,159
would go there oh okay um and that's
 

1953
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,829
would go there oh okay um and that's
happened in my games as well like i

1954
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:41,839
happened in my games as well like i
 

1955
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:43,589
happened in my games as well like i
forgot about castling

1956
00:34:43,589 --> 00:34:43,599
forgot about castling
 

1957
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:46,230
forgot about castling
uh and i'd be like attacking a king over

1958
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:46,240
uh and i'd be like attacking a king over
 

1959
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,869
uh and i'd be like attacking a king over
here and then all of a sudden it escapes

1960
00:34:48,869 --> 00:34:48,879
here and then all of a sudden it escapes
 

1961
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:52,310
here and then all of a sudden it escapes
to the other side i think um

1962
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:52,320
to the other side i think um
 

1963
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,710
to the other side i think um
i think fisher chess is

1964
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:54,720
i think fisher chess is
 

1965
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,030
i think fisher chess is
is good that it it's

1966
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:57,040
is good that it it's
 

1967
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,710
is good that it it's
the maps will

1968
00:34:58,710 --> 00:34:58,720
the maps will
 

1969
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,230
the maps will
generally

1970
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:00,240
generally
 

1971
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,910
generally
be worse than regular chest like i think

1972
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:03,920
be worse than regular chest like i think
 

1973
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:04,790
be worse than regular chest like i think
the

1974
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:04,800
the
 

1975
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,750
the
starting position is as close to

1976
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:07,760
starting position is as close to
 

1977
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,790
starting position is as close to
ideal for creating a competitive game

1978
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:10,800
ideal for creating a competitive game
 

1979
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,790
ideal for creating a competitive game
as possible but they will still be like

1980
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:12,800
as possible but they will still be like
 

1981
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,430
as possible but they will still be like
interesting and diverse enough that you

1982
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:15,440
interesting and diverse enough that you
 

1983
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,030
interesting and diverse enough that you
can play very

1984
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:17,040
can play very
 

1985
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,109
can play very
very interesting games so when you say

1986
00:35:19,109 --> 00:35:19,119
very interesting games so when you say
 

1987
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:21,829
very interesting games so when you say
maps there's 960 different options and

1988
00:35:21,829 --> 00:35:21,839
maps there's 960 different options and
 

1989
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:23,910
maps there's 960 different options and
like what fraction of that creates

1990
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:23,920
like what fraction of that creates
 

1991
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,910
like what fraction of that creates
interesting games at the highest level

1992
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:25,920
interesting games at the highest level
 

1993
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,430
interesting games at the highest level
and this is something that a lot of

1994
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:27,440
and this is something that a lot of
 

1995
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,589
and this is something that a lot of
people are curious about because uh when

1996
00:35:29,589 --> 00:35:29,599
people are curious about because uh when
 

1997
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:31,030
people are curious about because uh when
you challenge

1998
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:31,040
you challenge
 

1999
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:35,510
you challenge
a great chess player like yourself to um

2000
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:35,520
a great chess player like yourself to um
 

2001
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,069
a great chess player like yourself to um
to look at a random starting position

2002
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:38,079
to look at a random starting position
 

2003
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:40,390
to look at a random starting position
that feels like it pushes you to play

2004
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:40,400
that feels like it pushes you to play
 

2005
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,470
that feels like it pushes you to play
pure chess versus memorizing live yeah

2006
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:42,480
pure chess versus memorizing live yeah
 

2007
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,470
pure chess versus memorizing live yeah
for sure for sure but that's that's the

2008
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:44,480
for sure for sure but that's that's the
 

2009
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,870
for sure for sure but that's that's the
whole idea yeah that's what you want and

2010
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:46,880
whole idea yeah that's what you want and
 

2011
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,470
whole idea yeah that's what you want and
uh how hard is it to play i mean can you

2012
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:48,480
uh how hard is it to play i mean can you
 

2013
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,230
uh how hard is it to play i mean can you
talk about what what it feels like to

2014
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:50,240
talk about what what it feels like to
 

2015
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,470
talk about what what it feels like to
you to play with a random starting

2016
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:52,480
you to play with a random starting
 

2017
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,230
you to play with a random starting
position is there some intuition you've

2018
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:54,240
position is there some intuition you've
 

2019
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,230
position is there some intuition you've
been building up it's very very

2020
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:56,240
been building up it's very very
 

2021
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,030
been building up it's very very
different and i mean

2022
00:35:59,030 --> 00:35:59,040
different and i mean
 

2023
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,829
different and i mean
understandably engines have

2024
00:36:01,829 --> 00:36:01,839
understandably engines have
 

2025
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:05,109
understandably engines have
an even greater advantage in 960 than

2026
00:36:05,109 --> 00:36:05,119
an even greater advantage in 960 than
 

2027
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:06,310
an even greater advantage in 960 than
they have in

2028
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:06,320
they have in
 

2029
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,310
they have in
in classical chess

2030
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:08,320
in classical chess
 

2031
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,430
in classical chess
no it's it's super interesting and

2032
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:11,440
no it's it's super interesting and
 

2033
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,030
no it's it's super interesting and
that's why i also

2034
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:13,040
that's why i also
 

2035
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,550
that's why i also
i really wish that

2036
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:14,560
i really wish that
 

2037
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,670
i really wish that
we uh

2038
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:15,680
we uh
 

2039
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,470
we uh
played more classical chess like

2040
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:18,480
played more classical chess like
 

2041
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,390
played more classical chess like
long games

2042
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:20,400
long games
 

2043
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,790
long games
four to seven hours and

2044
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:22,800
four to seven hours and
 

2045
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,910
four to seven hours and
in

2046
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:23,920
in
 

2047
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,310
in
fish random chess chest 960 because then

2048
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:26,320
fish random chess chest 960 because then
 

2049
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,829
fish random chess chest 960 because then
you really need

2050
00:36:27,829 --> 00:36:27,839
you really need
 

2051
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:29,990
you really need
you really need that time even on the

2052
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:30,000
you really need that time even on the
 

2053
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,270
you really need that time even on the
first moves

2054
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:31,280
first moves
 

2055
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,030
first moves
what what usually happens is that you

2056
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:33,040
what what usually happens is that you
 

2057
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,870
what what usually happens is that you
get 15 minutes before the game you

2058
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:34,880
get 15 minutes before the game you
 

2059
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,710
get 15 minutes before the game you
you're getting told the position 15

2060
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:36,720
you're getting told the position 15
 

2061
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,790
you're getting told the position 15
minutes before the game and then you

2062
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:38,800
minutes before the game and then you
 

2063
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,030
minutes before the game and then you
you can think about it a little bit even

2064
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:41,040
you can think about it a little bit even
 

2065
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,430
you can think about it a little bit even
you know check the computer but that's

2066
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:43,440
you know check the computer but that's
 

2067
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,630
you know check the computer but that's
all the time

2068
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:44,640
all the time
 

2069
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,150
all the time
you have but then you really need to

2070
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:46,160
you have but then you really need to
 

2071
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,750
you have but then you really need to
figure it out then

2072
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:47,760
figure it out then
 

2073
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,109
figure it out then
like

2074
00:36:49,109 --> 00:36:49,119
like
 

2075
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:50,870
like
some of the positions obviously are a

2076
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:50,880
some of the positions obviously are a
 

2077
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,270
some of the positions obviously are a
lot more interesting in than the others

2078
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:53,280
lot more interesting in than the others
 

2079
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,349
lot more interesting in than the others
in some of them it appears that like if

2080
00:36:55,349 --> 00:36:55,359
in some of them it appears that like if
 

2081
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:57,510
in some of them it appears that like if
you don't play symmetrically

2082
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:57,520
you don't play symmetrically
 

2083
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,790
you don't play symmetrically
at

2084
00:36:58,790 --> 00:36:58,800
at
 

2085
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,310
at
the start

2086
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:00,320
the start
 

2087
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,270
the start
then

2088
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:01,280
then
 

2089
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,550
then
you're probably going to be in a pretty

2090
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:02,560
you're probably going to be in a pretty
 

2091
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,150
you're probably going to be in a pretty
bad bad position what do you mean with

2092
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:04,160
bad bad position what do you mean with
 

2093
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,550
bad bad position what do you mean with
the pawns with the pawns yeah

2094
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:06,560
the pawns with the pawns yeah
 

2095
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,550
the pawns with the pawns yeah
why so that's the thing about that's the

2096
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:08,560
why so that's the thing about that's the
 

2097
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,109
why so that's the thing about that's the
thing about chess though so let's say

2098
00:37:11,109 --> 00:37:11,119
thing about chess though so let's say
 

2099
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:14,230
thing about chess though so let's say
white opens with e4 which is which has

2100
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:14,240
white opens with e4 which is which has
 

2101
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:17,270
white opens with e4 which is which has
always been the most played move

2102
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:17,280
always been the most played move
 

2103
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,190
always been the most played move
there are many ways to meet that but the

2104
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:19,200
there are many ways to meet that but the
 

2105
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,670
there are many ways to meet that but the
most solid ways of playing has always

2106
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:21,680
most solid ways of playing has always
 

2107
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,829
most solid ways of playing has always
been the symmetrical response yeah uh

2108
00:37:23,829 --> 00:37:23,839
been the symmetrical response yeah uh
 

2109
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:26,150
been the symmetrical response yeah uh
with the e5 and then there's the

2110
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:26,160
with the e5 and then there's the
 

2111
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,230
with the e5 and then there's the
the real lopez there's the there's the

2112
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:28,240
the real lopez there's the there's the
 

2113
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:32,230
the real lopez there's the there's the
petrov opening and and so on and

2114
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:32,240
petrov opening and and so on and
 

2115
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,069
petrov opening and and so on and
if you just banned symmetry on the first

2116
00:37:34,069 --> 00:37:34,079
if you just banned symmetry on the first
 

2117
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:35,510
if you just banned symmetry on the first
move in chess

2118
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:35,520
move in chess
 

2119
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,910
move in chess
you would get more interesting games oh

2120
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:37,920
you would get more interesting games oh
 

2121
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,030
you would get more interesting games oh
interesting or you you get more decisive

2122
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:41,040
interesting or you you get more decisive
 

2123
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,069
interesting or you you get more decisive
um

2124
00:37:42,069 --> 00:37:42,079
um
 

2125
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:44,550
um
decisive games so that's the good thing

2126
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:44,560
decisive games so that's the good thing
 

2127
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,310
decisive games so that's the good thing
about chess is that we've played it so

2128
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:46,320
about chess is that we've played it so
 

2129
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,790
about chess is that we've played it so
long that we've actually devised

2130
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:48,800
long that we've actually devised
 

2131
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,710
long that we've actually devised
non-symmetrical openings that are also

2132
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:50,720
non-symmetrical openings that are also
 

2133
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,470
non-symmetrical openings that are also
fairly equal

2134
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:52,480
fairly equal
 

2135
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,670
fairly equal
and

2136
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:53,680
and
 

2137
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,670
and
symmetry is a good default but yeah

2138
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:55,680
symmetry is a good default but yeah
 

2139
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,829
symmetry is a good default but yeah
symmetry is a good default and it's a

2140
00:37:57,829 --> 00:37:57,839
symmetry is a good default and it's a
 

2141
00:37:57,839 --> 00:37:59,190
symmetry is a good default and it's a
problem that

2142
00:37:59,190 --> 00:37:59,200
problem that
 

2143
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,510
problem that
by playing symmetrical armed with good

2144
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:01,520
by playing symmetrical armed with good
 

2145
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,390
by playing symmetrical armed with good
preparation in regular chess is just a

2146
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:04,400
preparation in regular chess is just a
 

2147
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,270
preparation in regular chess is just a
little bit

2148
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:05,280
little bit
 

2149
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,750
little bit
too easy to uh it's a little bit too too

2150
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:07,760
too easy to uh it's a little bit too too
 

2151
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,030
too easy to uh it's a little bit too too
dryish and

2152
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:09,040
dryish and
 

2153
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,750
dryish and
um i guess if you analyzed

2154
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:11,760
um i guess if you analyzed
 

2155
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,710
um i guess if you analyzed
if you analyzed a lot in in just 960

2156
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:14,720
if you analyzed a lot in in just 960
 

2157
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,510
if you analyzed a lot in in just 960
then

2158
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:15,520
then
 

2159
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,470
then
um the um

2160
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:18,480
um the um
 

2161
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,550
um the um
a lot of the position would end up be

2162
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:20,560
a lot of the position would end up be
 

2163
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,230
a lot of the position would end up be
being um

2164
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:22,240
being um
 

2165
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,710
being um
pretty drawish as well um but

2166
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:24,720
pretty drawish as well um but
 

2167
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,390
pretty drawish as well um but
because the random starting point is so

2168
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:26,400
because the random starting point is so
 

2169
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,710
because the random starting point is so
shitty you're forced to you're actually

2170
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:28,720
shitty you're forced to you're actually
 

2171
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,710
shitty you're forced to you're actually
forced to play symmetrically like you

2172
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:30,720
forced to play symmetrically like you
 

2173
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,990
forced to play symmetrically like you
cannot actually try and play in a more

2174
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:34,000
cannot actually try and play in a more
 

2175
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,910
cannot actually try and play in a more
sort of interesting uh interesting

2176
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:35,920
sort of interesting uh interesting

manner
 

2179
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,190
manner
uh is there any other kind of variations

2180
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:39,200
uh is there any other kind of variations
 

2181
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,190
uh is there any other kind of variations
that are interesting to you

2182
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:41,200
that are interesting to you
 

2183
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,589
that are interesting to you
oh yeah there are there are several

2184
00:38:43,589 --> 00:38:43,599
oh yeah there are there are several
 

2185
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:47,589
oh yeah there are there are several
so no castling chess has been

2186
00:38:47,589 --> 00:38:47,599
so no castling chess has been
 

2187
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:49,670
so no castling chess has been
has been promoted by former world

2188
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:49,680
has been promoted by former world
 

2189
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,390
has been promoted by former world
champion vladimir kramnik there have

2190
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:52,400
champion vladimir kramnik there have
 

2191
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,150
champion vladimir kramnik there have
been a few tournaments

2192
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:54,160
been a few tournaments
 

2193
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,390
been a few tournaments
with that not

2194
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:56,400
with that not
 

2195
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,109
with that not
any that i've participated in though um

2196
00:38:59,109 --> 00:38:59,119
any that i've participated in though um
 

2197
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:02,550
any that i've participated in though um
i kind of like it also my coach uses

2198
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:02,560
i kind of like it also my coach uses
 

2199
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,390
i kind of like it also my coach uses
like non-castling

2200
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:04,400
like non-castling
 

2201
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,430
like non-castling
engines quite a bit to analyze

2202
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:07,440
engines quite a bit to analyze
 

2203
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,750
engines quite a bit to analyze
regular positions to just to get

2204
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:09,760
regular positions to just to get
 

2205
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,510
regular positions to just to get
a different

2206
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:11,520
a different
 

2207
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,990
a different
different perspective um so castling is

2208
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:14,000
different perspective um so castling is
 

2209
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,829
different perspective um so castling is
like a defensive thing so if you remove

2210
00:39:15,829 --> 00:39:15,839
like a defensive thing so if you remove
 

2211
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:17,670
like a defensive thing so if you remove
castling it forces you to be more

2212
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:17,680
castling it forces you to be more
 

2213
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,430
castling it forces you to be more
offensive is that why

2214
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:19,440
offensive is that why
 

2215
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,190
offensive is that why
yeah it just yeah for for sure um it

2216
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:23,200
yeah it just yeah for for sure um it
 

2217
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,470
yeah it just yeah for for sure um it
seems like a i think it will be

2218
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:24,480
seems like a i think it will be
 

2219
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,150
seems like a i think it will be
different um

2220
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:26,160
different um
 

2221
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,710
different um
no castling probably forces you to be a

2222
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:28,720
no castling probably forces you to be a
 

2223
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,390
no castling probably forces you to be a
little bit more

2224
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:30,400
little bit more
 

2225
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,630
little bit more
defensive at the start or i would guess

2226
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:32,640
defensive at the start or i would guess
 

2227
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,670
defensive at the start or i would guess
so

2228
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:33,680
so
 

2229
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,349
so
because you cannot suddenly escape with

2230
00:39:35,349 --> 00:39:35,359
because you cannot suddenly escape with
 

2231
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:36,230
because you cannot suddenly escape with
the

2232
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:36,240
the
 

2233
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,829
the
with with the kings that it's going to

2234
00:39:37,829 --> 00:39:37,839
with with the kings that it's going to
 

2235
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:39,910
with with the kings that it's going to
make the game a bit slower at the start

2236
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:39,920
make the game a bit slower at the start
 

2237
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,790
make the game a bit slower at the start
but

2238
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:40,800
but
 

2239
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,190
but
i feel like eventually it's gonna

2240
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:45,200

 

2241
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,349

uh it's gonna make the more games more

2242
00:39:47,349 --> 00:39:47,359
uh it's gonna make the more games more
 

2243
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:48,470
uh it's gonna make the more games more
um

2244
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:48,480
um
 

2245
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,349
um
uh well less drawish for for sure then

2246
00:39:51,349 --> 00:39:51,359
uh well less drawish for for sure then
 

2247
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:54,790
uh well less drawish for for sure then
you have some weirder variants like

2248
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:54,800
you have some weirder variants like
 

2249
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,829
you have some weirder variants like
where the pawns can move both

2250
00:39:57,829 --> 00:39:57,839
where the pawns can move both
 

2251
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:00,630
where the pawns can move both
diagonally and

2252
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:00,640
diagonally and
 

2253
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,470
diagonally and
and forward

2254
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:02,480
and forward
 

2255
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,550
and forward
and also you have self-captured chests

2256
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:04,560
and also you have self-captured chests
 

2257
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,630
and also you have self-captured chests
which is quite interesting so their

2258
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:06,640
which is quite interesting so their
 

2259
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,910
which is quite interesting so their
pawns can

2260
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:07,920
pawns can
 

2261
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,349
pawns can
or

2262
00:40:09,349 --> 00:40:09,359
or
 

2263
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:11,670
or
commit suicide or yeah people can why

2264
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:11,680
commit suicide or yeah people can why
 

2265
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,309
commit suicide or yeah people can why
would that be a use a good move no

2266
00:40:14,309 --> 00:40:14,319
would that be a use a good move no
 

2267
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:16,790
would that be a use a good move no
sometimes one of your pieces occupy a

2268
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:16,800
sometimes one of your pieces occupy a
 

2269
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,710
sometimes one of your pieces occupy a
square i mean

2270
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:18,720
square i mean
 

2271
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,910
square i mean
uh let me just set up a position let's

2272
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:21,920
uh let me just set up a position let's
 

2273
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,510
uh let me just set up a position let's
put it

2274
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:23,520
put it
 

2275
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,109
put it
put it like this

2276
00:40:25,109 --> 00:40:25,119
put it like this
 

2277
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:26,870
put it like this
for instance like here i mean there are

2278
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:26,880
for instance like here i mean there are
 

2279
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,430
for instance like here i mean there are
a lot of ways to checkmate for white

2280
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:29,440
a lot of ways to checkmate for white
 

2281
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,870
a lot of ways to checkmate for white
like this for instance or there are

2282
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:30,880
like this for instance or there are
 

2283
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,990
like this for instance or there are
several ways

2284
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:32,000
several ways
 

2285
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,630
several ways
um but like this would be uh

2286
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:34,640
um but like this would be uh
 

2287
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,470
um but like this would be uh
would be uh

2288
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:36,480
would be uh
 

2289
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,790
would be uh
oh cool for people who are just

2290
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:38,800
oh cool for people who are just
 

2291
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,870
oh cool for people who are just
listening yeah basically you're bringing

2292
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:40,880
listening yeah basically you're bringing
 

2293
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,349
listening yeah basically you're bringing
in a knight close to the the whole the

2294
00:40:43,349 --> 00:40:43,359
in a knight close to the the whole the
 

2295
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:45,030
in a knight close to the the whole the
the king the queen and so on yeah and

2296
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:45,040
the king the queen and so on yeah and
 

2297
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,950
the king the queen and so on yeah and
you replace the knight with a queen yeah

2298
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:46,960
you replace the knight with a queen yeah
 

2299
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,030
you replace the knight with a queen yeah
that's interesting so you have like a a

2300
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:49,040
that's interesting so you have like a a
 

2301
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,069
that's interesting so you have like a a
front

2302
00:40:50,069 --> 00:40:50,079
front
 

2303
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:52,230
front
of of uh pieces and then you just

2304
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:52,240
of of uh pieces and then you just
 

2305
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,230
of of uh pieces and then you just
replace them with the with the second

2306
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:54,240
replace them with the with the second
 

2307
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,069
replace them with the with the second
yeah uh that's cool i mean that could be

2308
00:40:56,069 --> 00:40:56,079
yeah uh that's cool i mean that could be
 

2309
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:58,230
yeah uh that's cool i mean that could be
interesting i think also maybe sometimes

2310
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:58,240
interesting i think also maybe sometimes
 

2311
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,030
interesting i think also maybe sometimes
in

2312
00:40:59,030 --> 00:40:59,040
in
 

2313
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,510
in
it's just clearance basically it adds an

2314
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:01,520
it's just clearance basically it adds an
 

2315
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,589
it's just clearance basically it adds an
extra element of

2316
00:41:03,589 --> 00:41:03,599
extra element of
 

2317
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:05,589
extra element of
of clearance so

2318
00:41:05,589 --> 00:41:05,599
of clearance so
 

2319
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:07,910
of clearance so
i think there are many um

2320
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:07,920
i think there are many um
 

2321
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,309
i think there are many um
many uh different variants i don't think

2322
00:41:10,309 --> 00:41:10,319
many uh different variants i don't think
 

2323
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:11,910
many uh different variants i don't think
any of them are

2324
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:11,920
any of them are
 

2325
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,109
any of them are
better than

2326
00:41:13,109 --> 00:41:13,119
better than
 

2327
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:15,990
better than
the one that has been played for uh at

2328
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:16,000
the one that has been played for uh at
 

2329
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,230
the one that has been played for uh at
least a thousand years but um

2330
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:18,240
least a thousand years but um
 

2331
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,190
least a thousand years but um
it's certainly interesting to um

2332
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:21,200
it's certainly interesting to um
 

2333
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,230
it's certainly interesting to um
to see

2334
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:22,240
to see
 

2335
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,150
to see
so one of your goals is to reach the

2336
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:24,160
so one of your goals is to reach the
 

2337
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:27,829
so one of your goals is to reach the
feed a elo chest rating of 2 900.

2338
00:41:27,829 --> 00:41:27,839
feed a elo chest rating of 2 900.
 

2339
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:29,270
feed a elo chest rating of 2 900.
maybe you can comment on how's this

2340
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:29,280
maybe you can comment on how's this
 

2341
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,670
maybe you can comment on how's this
rating calculated and what does it take

2342
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:31,680
rating calculated and what does it take
 

2343
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,349
rating calculated and what does it take
to get there

2344
00:41:33,349 --> 00:41:33,359
to get there
 

2345
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:35,349
to get there
is it possible for a human being to get

2346
00:41:35,349 --> 00:41:35,359
is it possible for a human being to get
 

2347
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:37,510
is it possible for a human being to get
there basically you play with a factor

2348
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:37,520
there basically you play with a factor
 

2349
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,670
there basically you play with a factor
of um 10

2350
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:39,680
of um 10
 

2351
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,430
of um 10
which means that if i were to play

2352
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:41,440
which means that if i were to play
 

2353
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,710
which means that if i were to play
against

2354
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:42,720
against
 

2355
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,670
against
um an opponent who's rated the same as

2356
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:45,680
um an opponent who's rated the same as
 

2357
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,870
um an opponent who's rated the same as
me i would be expected

2358
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:48,880
me i would be expected
 

2359
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,550
me i would be expected
to score fifty percent obviously and

2360
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:50,560
to score fifty percent obviously and
 

2361
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:53,109
to score fifty percent obviously and
that means that i would win five points

2362
00:41:53,109 --> 00:41:53,119
that means that i would win five points
 

2363
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:55,270
that means that i would win five points
with a win and lose five points with the

2364
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:55,280
with a win and lose five points with the
 

2365
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,829
with a win and lose five points with the
draw and then equal if i if i draw if

2366
00:41:57,829 --> 00:41:57,839
draw and then equal if i if i draw if
 

2367
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:00,710
draw and then equal if i if i draw if
your opponent is 200 points lower rated

2368
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:00,720
your opponent is 200 points lower rated
 

2369
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:04,470
your opponent is 200 points lower rated
you're expected to score 75 and and and

2370
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:04,480
you're expected to score 75 and and and
 

2371
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,510
you're expected to score 75 and and and
so on

2372
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:05,520
so on
 

2373
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,190
so on
and you establish that rating by playing

2374
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:07,200
and you establish that rating by playing
 

2375
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,950
and you establish that rating by playing
a lot of people and then it slowly

2376
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:08,960
a lot of people and then it slowly
 

2377
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,190
a lot of people and then it slowly
converges towards an estimate of how

2378
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:11,200
converges towards an estimate of how
 

2379
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,870
converges towards an estimate of how
likely you are to win or lose against

2380
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:12,880
likely you are to win or lose against
 

2381
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,710
likely you are to win or lose against
differences yeah and uh

2382
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:14,720
differences yeah and uh
 

2383
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:17,030
differences yeah and uh
my rating is obviously carried through

2384
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:17,040
my rating is obviously carried through
 

2385
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,710
my rating is obviously carried through
thousands of

2386
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:18,720
thousands of
 

2387
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,710
thousands of
of games um

2388
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:20,720
of games um
 

2389
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:24,710
of games um
right now my rating is 28 61

2390
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:24,720
right now my rating is 28 61
 

2391
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,190
right now my rating is 28 61
which is decent like i think that pretty

2392
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:27,200
which is decent like i think that pretty
 

2393
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,069
which is decent like i think that pretty
much

2394
00:42:28,069 --> 00:42:28,079
much
 

2395
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:31,430
much
corresponds to to the level i have at

2396
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:31,440
corresponds to to the level i have at
 

2397
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,990
corresponds to to the level i have at
at the moment which means in order to

2398
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:34,000
at the moment which means in order to
 

2399
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,150
at the moment which means in order to
reach 2900

2400
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:36,160
reach 2900
 

2401
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,309
reach 2900
i would have to

2402
00:42:38,309 --> 00:42:38,319
i would have to
 

2403
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:41,270
i would have to
either get better at chess which i think

2404
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:41,280
either get better at chess which i think
 

2405
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,030
either get better at chess which i think
is

2406
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:43,040
is
 

2407
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,870
is
fairly hard to

2408
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:44,880
fairly hard to
 

2409
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,270
fairly hard to
to do at least considerably better so

2410
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:47,280
to do at least considerably better so
 

2411
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,670
to do at least considerably better so
what i would need to do is

2412
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:49,680
what i would need to do is
 

2413
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,270
what i would need to do is
try and optimize

2414
00:42:51,270 --> 00:42:51,280
try and optimize
 

2415
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,910
try and optimize
even more in terms of

2416
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:53,920
even more in terms of
 

2417
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,550
even more in terms of
the matchups preparations everything but

2418
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:56,560
the matchups preparations everything but
 

2419
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,550
the matchups preparations everything but
not not necessarily like selecting

2420
00:42:58,550 --> 00:42:58,560
not not necessarily like selecting
 

2421
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,190
not not necessarily like selecting
tournaments and so on but like just

2422
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:01,200
tournaments and so on but like just
 

2423
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,030
tournaments and so on but like just
optimizing in terms of

2424
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:03,040
optimizing in terms of
 

2425
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:06,150
optimizing in terms of
of preparation like making sure i'm

2426
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:06,160
of preparation like making sure i'm
 

2427
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,950
of preparation like making sure i'm
i'm i never have any bad days and you so

2428
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:08,960
i'm i never have any bad days and you so
 

2429
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,790
i'm i never have any bad days and you so
you basically can't lose yeah i

2430
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:10,800
you basically can't lose yeah i
 

2431
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,589
you basically can't lose yeah i
basically can't [\h__\h] up ever uh if i

2432
00:43:13,589 --> 00:43:13,599
basically can't [\h__\h] up ever uh if i
 

2433
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:14,790
basically can't [\h__\h] up ever uh if i
wanna

2434
00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:14,800
wanna
 

2435
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:18,390
wanna
if if i wanna reach that goal and so i i

2436
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:18,400
if if i wanna reach that goal and so i i
 

2437
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,349
if if i wanna reach that goal and so i i
think

2438
00:43:19,349 --> 00:43:19,359
think
 

2439
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:22,550
think
reaching 2900 is pretty unlikely

2440
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:22,560
reaching 2900 is pretty unlikely
 

2441
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,190
reaching 2900 is pretty unlikely
the reason i've set the goal is

2442
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:25,200
the reason i've set the goal is
 

2443
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,950
the reason i've set the goal is
to have something to

2444
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:26,960
to have something to
 

2445
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,430
to have something to
to play for to have like

2446
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:29,440
to play for to have like
 

2447
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,990
to play for to have like
to have a motivation to

2448
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:32,000
to have a motivation to
 

2449
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,030
to have a motivation to
actually try and and be at my best when

2450
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:35,040
actually try and and be at my best when
 

2451
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,829
actually try and and be at my best when
i play because otherwise

2452
00:43:37,829 --> 00:43:37,839

game that i couldn't really get anywhere

2720
00:48:27,829 --> 00:48:27,839
game that i couldn't really get anywhere
 

2721
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:30,390
game that i couldn't really get anywhere
for a lot of games and he he had a

2722
00:48:30,390 --> 00:48:30,400
for a lot of games and he he had a
 

2723
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:31,990
for a lot of games and he he had a
couple of games where he could

2724
00:48:31,990 --> 00:48:32,000
couple of games where he could
 

2725
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,109
couple of games where he could
potentially have won um then in the last

2726
00:48:35,109 --> 00:48:35,119
potentially have won um then in the last
 

2727
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:36,870
potentially have won um then in the last
game i was a little bit better

2728
00:48:36,870 --> 00:48:36,880
game i was a little bit better
 

2729
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,430
game i was a little bit better
and eventually there they were all they

2730
00:48:39,430 --> 00:48:39,440
and eventually there they were all they
 

2731
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,589
and eventually there they were all they
were all drawn but i felt like all the

2732
00:48:41,589 --> 00:48:41,599
were all drawn but i felt like all the
 

2733
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:43,349
were all drawn but i felt like all the
way that this is an interesting match

2734
00:48:43,349 --> 00:48:43,359
way that this is an interesting match
 

2735
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:46,230
way that this is an interesting match
against an an opponent who is at this

2736
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:46,240
against an an opponent who is at this
 

2737
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,510
against an an opponent who is at this
position

2738
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:47,520
position
 

2739
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,589
position
uh at this point equal to me

2740
00:48:49,589 --> 00:48:49,599
uh at this point equal to me
 

2741
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:51,750
uh at this point equal to me
and so losing that would not have been

2742
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:51,760
and so losing that would not have been
 

2743
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,510
and so losing that would not have been
this disaster

2744
00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:53,520
this disaster
 

2745
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,430
this disaster
because all in all the other matches i

2746
00:48:55,430 --> 00:48:55,440
because all in all the other matches i
 

2747
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,829
because all in all the other matches i
would know that i would i've lost

2748
00:48:57,829 --> 00:48:57,839
would know that i would i've lost

00:49:00,549 --> 00:49:00,559
who i know
 

2753
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:03,910
who i know
i'm much better than and that would be

2754
00:49:03,910 --> 00:49:03,920
i'm much better than and that would be
 

2755
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,470
i'm much better than and that would be
would be a lot harder for me to um to

2756
00:49:06,470 --> 00:49:06,480
would be a lot harder for me to um to
 

2757

that only happens

2774
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:25,680
that only happens
 

2775
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:28,150
that only happens
rarely to a person who's not as good as

2776
00:49:28,150 --> 00:49:28,160
rarely to a person who's not as good as
 

2777
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,549
rarely to a person who's not as good as
you yeah and that's why it's also been

2778
00:49:30,549 --> 00:49:30,559
you yeah and that's why it's also been
 

2779
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:32,470
you yeah and that's why it's also been
incredibly frustrating in other matches

2780
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:32,480
incredibly frustrating in other matches
 

2781
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,390
incredibly frustrating in other matches
like when i know

2782
00:49:34,390 --> 00:49:34,400
like when i know
 

2783
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,870
like when i know
when we play draw after draw

2784
00:49:36,870 --> 00:49:36,880
when we play draw after draw
 

2785
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:39,510
when we play draw after draw
and i can just i i know that i'm better

2786
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:39,520
and i can just i i know that i'm better
 

2787
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:40,470
and i can just i i know that i'm better
i can

2788
00:49:40,470 --> 00:49:40,480
i can
 

2789
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,390
i can
sense during the game that i understand

2790
00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:42,400
sense during the game that i understand
 

2791
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,069
sense during the game that i understand
it better than them but i cannot you

2792
00:49:44,069 --> 00:49:44,079
it better than them but i cannot you
 

2793
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:46,150
it better than them but i cannot you
know i cannot get over the hump

2794
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:46,160
know i cannot get over the hump
 

2795
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:46,870
know i cannot get over the hump
so

2796
00:49:46,870 --> 00:49:46,880
so
 

2797
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:48,150
so
you are

2798
00:49:48,150 --> 00:49:48,160
you are
 

2799
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:51,030
you are
the best chess player in the world

2800
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:51,040
the best chess player in the world
 

2801
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,790
the best chess player in the world
and you not playing the world

2802
00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:52,800
and you not playing the world
 

2803
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,109
and you not playing the world
championship really

2804
00:49:55,109 --> 00:49:55,119
championship really
 

2805
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:57,270
championship really
makes the world championship not seem

2806
00:49:57,270 --> 00:49:57,280
makes the world championship not seem
 

2807
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,190
makes the world championship not seem
important or i mean there's an argument

2808
00:49:59,190 --> 00:49:59,200
important or i mean there's an argument
 

2809
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,950
important or i mean there's an argument
to be made for that

2810
00:50:00,950 --> 00:50:00,960
to be made for that
 

2811
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,430
to be made for that
um is there anything you would like to

2812
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:03,440
um is there anything you would like to
 

2813
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:04,870
um is there anything you would like to
see if you had a change about the world

2814
00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:04,880
see if you had a change about the world
 

2815
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,470
see if you had a change about the world
championship that would make it more fun

2816
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:06,480
championship that would make it more fun
 

2817
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,710
championship that would make it more fun
for you and better for the game of chess

2818
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:08,720
for you and better for the game of chess
 

2819
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:11,430
for you and better for the game of chess
period for everybody involved so i think

2820
00:50:11,430 --> 00:50:11,440
period for everybody involved so i think
 

2821
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:14,870
period for everybody involved so i think
12 games or now 14 games that there is

2822
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:14,880
12 games or now 14 games that there is
 

2823
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:18,230
12 games or now 14 games that there is
for the world championship is a fairly

2824
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:18,240
for the world championship is a fairly
 

2825
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,710
for the world championship is a fairly
fairly low sample size if you want to

2826
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:20,720
fairly low sample size if you want to
 

2827
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:23,349
fairly low sample size if you want to
determine who the best player is or at

2828
00:50:23,349 --> 00:50:23,359
determine who the best player is or at
 

2829
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:25,670
determine who the best player is or at
least the best player in that particular

2830
00:50:25,670 --> 00:50:25,680
least the best player in that particular
 

2831
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:28,069
least the best player in that particular
matchup you need more more games and i

2832
00:50:28,069 --> 00:50:28,079
matchup you need more more games and i
 

2833
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:28,870
matchup you need more more games and i
think

2834
00:50:28,870 --> 00:50:28,880
think
 

2835
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:31,750
think
to some extent

2836
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:31,760

 

2837
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,990

if you're going to have a world champion

2838
00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:34,000
if you're going to have a world champion
 

2839
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,230
if you're going to have a world champion
and call them the best players you best

2840
00:50:36,230 --> 00:50:36,240
and call them the best players you best
 

2841
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:37,510
and call them the best players you best
player you got to make sure that the

2842
00:50:37,510 --> 00:50:37,520
player you got to make sure that the
 

2843
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:38,630
player you got to make sure that the
format

2844
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:38,640
format
 

2845
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:40,870
format
increases the chance of finding

2846
00:50:40,870 --> 00:50:40,880
increases the chance of finding
 

2847
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,309
increases the chance of finding
finding the best players so i think

2848
00:50:42,309 --> 00:50:42,319
finding the best players so i think
 

2849
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:43,829
finding the best players so i think
having more games

2850
00:50:43,829 --> 00:50:43,839
having more games
 

2851
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:45,430
having more games
and if you're going to have a lot more

2852
00:50:45,430 --> 00:50:45,440
and if you're going to have a lot more
 

2853
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,349
and if you're going to have a lot more
games than you need to

2854
00:50:47,349 --> 00:50:47,359
games than you need to
 

2855
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:48,950
games than you need to
then you need to decrease the time

2856
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:48,960
then you need to decrease the time
 

2857
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,230
then you need to decrease the time
control a bit

2858
00:50:50,230 --> 00:50:50,240
control a bit
 

2859
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:51,109
control a bit
which

2860
00:50:51,109 --> 00:50:51,119
which
 

2861
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:52,950
which
in turn i think is also

2862
00:50:52,950 --> 00:50:52,960
in turn i think is also
 

2863
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:55,670
in turn i think is also
a good thing because

2864
00:50:55,670 --> 00:50:55,680
a good thing because
 

2865
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:58,230
a good thing because
in very long time controls with

2866
00:50:58,230 --> 00:50:58,240
in very long time controls with
 

2867
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:01,430
in very long time controls with
deep preparation you can sort of mask a

2868
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:01,440
deep preparation you can sort of mask a
 

2869
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:04,069
deep preparation you can sort of mask a
lot of your deficiencies as

2870
00:51:04,069 --> 00:51:04,079
lot of your deficiencies as
 

2871
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:06,230
lot of your deficiencies as
as as a chess player

2872
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:06,240
as as a chess player
 

2873
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:09,190
as as a chess player
with because you have a lot of time to

2874
00:51:09,190 --> 00:51:09,200
with because you have a lot of time to
 

2875
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,829
with because you have a lot of time to
to think and to defend and also

2876
00:51:11,829 --> 00:51:11,839
to think and to defend and also
 

2877
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:14,790
to think and to defend and also
yeah you have deep preparation um

2878
00:51:14,790 --> 00:51:14,800
yeah you have deep preparation um
 

2879
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,470
yeah you have deep preparation um
so i think those would be

2880
00:51:16,470 --> 00:51:16,480
so i think those would be
 

2881
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:19,430
so i think those would be
for me to play um those would be

2882
00:51:19,430 --> 00:51:19,440
for me to play um those would be
 

2883
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,990
for me to play um those would be
the the main the main the main things

2884
00:51:21,990 --> 00:51:22,000
the the main the main the main things
 

2885
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:22,790
the the main the main the main things
more

2886
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:22,800
more
 

2887
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:25,109
more
more games and less time so you want to

2888
00:51:25,109 --> 00:51:25,119
more games and less time so you want to
 

2889
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:26,710
more games and less time so you want to
see more games

2890
00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:26,720
see more games
 

2891
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:30,150
see more games
and uh rules that emphasize pure chess

2892
00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:30,160
and uh rules that emphasize pure chess
 

2893
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,750
and uh rules that emphasize pure chess
yeah but already

2894
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:31,760
yeah but already
 

2895
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,910
yeah but already
less time emphasize

2896
00:51:33,910 --> 00:51:33,920
less time emphasize
 

2897
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,790
less time emphasize
emphasizes pure pure chess because

2898
00:51:36,790 --> 00:51:36,800
emphasizes pure pure chess because
 

2899
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:37,589
emphasizes pure pure chess because
um

2900
00:51:37,589 --> 00:51:37,599
um
 

2901
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:38,790
um
defensive

2902
00:51:38,790 --> 00:51:38,800
defensive
 

2903
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,030
defensive
techniques are much harder to execute

2904
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:41,040
techniques are much harder to execute
 

2905
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:43,030
techniques are much harder to execute
with a little time what do you think is

2906
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:43,040
with a little time what do you think is
 

2907
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:45,109
with a little time what do you think is
there a sweet spot in terms of are we

2908
00:51:45,109 --> 00:51:45,119
there a sweet spot in terms of are we
 

2909
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:47,109
there a sweet spot in terms of are we
talking about blitz is it how many

2910
00:51:47,109 --> 00:51:47,119
talking about blitz is it how many
 

2911
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:49,430
talking about blitz is it how many
places a bit too fast um

2912
00:51:49,430 --> 00:51:49,440
places a bit too fast um
 

2913
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:52,150
places a bit too fast um

for a start to have two games per day

2918
00:51:57,190 --> 00:51:57,200
for a start to have two games per day
 

2919
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,270
for a start to have two games per day
and let's say you have

2920
00:51:59,270 --> 00:51:59,280
and let's say you have
 

2921
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,990
and let's say you have
45 minutes a game plus

2922
00:52:01,990 --> 00:52:02,000
45 minutes a game plus
 

2923
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,790
45 minutes a game plus
15 or or 30 seconds per move that means

2924
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:04,800
15 or or 30 seconds per move that means
 

2925
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,309
15 or or 30 seconds per move that means
that each sessions will probably be

2926
00:52:06,309 --> 00:52:06,319
that each sessions will probably be
 

2927
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:07,349
that each sessions will probably be
about

2928
00:52:07,349 --> 00:52:07,359
about
 

2929
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:10,069
about
or a little less than two hours yeah

2930
00:52:10,069 --> 00:52:10,079
or a little less than two hours yeah
 

2931
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:12,230
or a little less than two hours yeah
that would be would be a start also

2932
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:12,240
that would be would be a start also
 

2933
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:13,349
that would be would be a start also
what's

2934
00:52:13,349 --> 00:52:13,359
what's
 

2935
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:14,710

two games a day you know that's 24. i
 

2985

two games a day you know that's 24. i
feel like that's already quite a bit

2986
00:53:10,710 --> 00:53:10,720
feel like that's already quite a bit
 

2987
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:13,270
feel like that's already quite a bit
better you play like one black game one

2988
00:53:13,270 --> 00:53:13,280
better you play like one black game one
 

2989

2991
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:17,349
white game
each day endurance wise that's okay yeah

2992
00:53:17,349 --> 00:53:17,359
each day endurance wise that's okay yeah
 

2993
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:18,710
each day endurance wise that's okay yeah
i think that's fine like you will have

2994
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:18,720
i think that's fine like you will have
 

2995
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,470
i think that's fine like you will have
three days as well so i don't think that

2996
00:53:20,470 --> 00:53:20,480
three days as well so i don't think that
 

2997
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,710
three days as well so i don't think that
will be will be a problem

2998
00:53:22,710 --> 00:53:22,720
will be will be a problem
 

2999
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:25,670
will be will be a problem
um and also you have to prepare two sets

3000
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:25,680
um and also you have to prepare two sets
 

3001
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,990
um and also you have to prepare two sets
of openings for each day which makes it

3002
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:28,000
of openings for each day which makes it
 

3003
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,309
of openings for each day which makes it
more difficult for the teams preparing

3004
00:53:30,309 --> 00:53:30,319
more difficult for the teams preparing
 

3005
00:53:30,319 --> 00:53:32,309
more difficult for the teams preparing
yeah which i think is also good

3006
00:53:32,309 --> 00:53:32,319

uh ding vs nepo who wins
 

3351
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:47,990
uh ding vs nepo who wins
the current the two people that would

3352
00:59:47,990 --> 00:59:48,000
the current the two people that would
 

3353
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:48,870
the current the two people that would
play

generally i would consider that ding has
 

3359
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:54,150
generally i would consider that ding has
a slightly

3360
00:59:54,150 --> 00:59:54,160
a slightly
 

3361
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:57,270
a slightly
better overall chest strength um what

are the strengths and weaknesses of each
 

3365
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:00,630
are the strengths and weaknesses of each
if you can kind of

3366

those
 

3415
01:00:57,599 --> 01:00:59,990
those
yes i would say he's very very good at

3416
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:00,000
yes i would say he's very very good at
 

3417
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,109
yes i would say he's very very good at
that and understanding the you know the

3418
01:01:03,109 --> 01:01:03,119
that and understanding the you know the
 

3419
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:05,510
that and understanding the you know the
dynamic factors as we call them like

3420
01:01:05,510 --> 01:01:05,520
dynamic factors as we call them like
 

3421
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:08,230
dynamic factors as we call them like
material versus time

3422
01:01:08,230 --> 01:01:08,240
material versus time
 

3423
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:11,190
material versus time
uh especially i think nepal got the

3424
01:01:11,190 --> 01:01:11,200
uh especially i think nepal got the
 

3425
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:13,430
uh especially i think nepal got the
better of him and the candidates so

3426
01:01:13,430 --> 01:01:13,440
better of him and the candidates so
 

3427
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,270
better of him and the candidates so
what's your sense why ding has an edge

3428
01:01:15,270 --> 01:01:15,280
what's your sense why ding has an edge
 

3429
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:18,069
what's your sense why ding has an edge
in the in the championship i feel like

3430
01:01:18,069 --> 01:01:18,079
in the in the championship i feel like
 

3431
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:20,470
in the in the championship i feel like
individual past results hasn't

3432
01:01:20,470 --> 01:01:20,480
individual past results hasn't
 

3433
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:22,069
individual past results hasn't
necessarily been

3434
01:01:22,069 --> 01:01:22,079
necessarily been
 

3435
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:24,630
necessarily been
a great indicator of world championship

3436
01:01:24,630 --> 01:01:24,640
a great indicator of world championship
 

3437
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:27,190
a great indicator of world championship
results uh i feel like over overall

3438
01:01:27,190 --> 01:01:27,200
results uh i feel like over overall
 

3439
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:30,069
results uh i feel like over overall
stress strength is more

3440
01:01:30,069 --> 01:01:30,079
stress strength is more
 

3441
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:32,630
stress strength is more
more important i mean to be fair i only

3442
01:01:32,630 --> 01:01:32,640
more important i mean to be fair i only
 

3443
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:34,390
more important i mean to be fair i only
think like ding has a very small edge

3444
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:34,400
think like ding has a very small edge
 

3445
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:37,109
think like ding has a very small edge
like difference is not big at all but

3446
01:01:37,109 --> 01:01:37,119
like difference is not big at all but
 

3447
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:40,870
like difference is not big at all but
our individual head-to-head record was

3448
01:01:40,870 --> 01:01:40,880
our individual head-to-head record was
 

3449
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:42,309
our individual head-to-head record was
probably the main reason that a lot of

3450
01:01:42,309 --> 01:01:42,319
probably the main reason that a lot of
 

3451
01:01:42,319 --> 01:01:43,910
probably the main reason that a lot of
people thought nepo had a good chance

3452
01:01:43,910 --> 01:01:43,920
people thought nepo had a good chance
 

3453
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:46,789
people thought nepo had a good chance
against me as well it was like

3454
01:01:46,789 --> 01:01:46,799
against me as well it was like
 

3455
01:01:46,799 --> 01:01:49,589
against me as well it was like
four to one in his favor

3456
01:01:49,589 --> 01:01:49,599
four to one in his favor
 

3457
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:50,630
four to one in his favor
before

3458
01:01:50,630 --> 01:01:50,640
before
 

3459
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:52,789
before
the match but that was just another

3460
01:01:52,789 --> 01:01:52,799
the match but that was just another
 

3461
01:01:52,799 --> 01:01:55,430
the match but that was just another
example of why that may not necessarily

3462
01:01:55,430 --> 01:01:55,440
example of why that may not necessarily
 

3463
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:57,829
example of why that may not necessarily
mean anything also in our case it was a

3464
01:01:57,829 --> 01:01:57,839
mean anything also in our case it was a
 

3465
01:01:57,839 --> 01:01:58,870
mean anything also in our case it was a
very

3466
01:01:58,870 --> 01:01:58,880
very
 

3467
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:01,270
very
very low sample size i i think

3468
01:02:01,270 --> 01:02:01,280
very low sample size i i think
 

3469
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:03,990
very low sample size i i think
about the size of of them of of the

3470
01:02:03,990 --> 01:02:04,000
about the size of of them of of the
 

3471
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,069
about the size of of them of of the
match in total 14 games and that

3472
01:02:06,069 --> 01:02:06,079
match in total 14 games and that
 

3473
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:07,990
match in total 14 games and that
generally doesn't

3474
01:02:07,990 --> 01:02:08,000
generally doesn't
 

3475
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,990
generally doesn't
doesn't mean much how close were those

3476
01:02:09,990 --> 01:02:10,000
doesn't mean much how close were those
 

3477
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,150
doesn't mean much how close were those
games would you say in your mind for the

3478
01:02:12,150 --> 01:02:12,160
games would you say in your mind for the
 

3479
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:13,910
games would you say in your mind for the
previous championship

3480
01:02:13,910 --> 01:02:13,920
previous championship
 

3481
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:16,549
previous championship
so that game 6 was a turning point where

3482
01:02:16,549 --> 01:02:16,559
so that game 6 was a turning point where
 

3483
01:02:16,559 --> 01:02:18,230
so that game 6 was a turning point where
you won

3484
01:02:18,230 --> 01:02:18,240
you won
 

3485
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:20,390
you won
was there any doubt in your mind that

3486
01:02:20,390 --> 01:02:20,400
was there any doubt in your mind that
 

3487
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:22,390
was there any doubt in your mind that
you know like if you do a much larger

3488
01:02:22,390 --> 01:02:22,400
you know like if you do a much larger
 

3489
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:24,549
you know like if you do a much larger
sample size you'll get the better of

3490
01:02:24,549 --> 01:02:24,559
sample size you'll get the better of
 

3491
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:27,270
sample size you'll get the better of
nippo no no larger larger sample size is

3492
01:02:27,270 --> 01:02:27,280
nippo no no larger larger sample size is
 

3493
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:28,549
nippo no no larger larger sample size is
always good for me

3494
01:02:28,549 --> 01:02:28,559
always good for me
 

3495
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:30,710
always good for me
so world championship it's it's a great

3496
01:02:30,710 --> 01:02:30,720
so world championship it's it's a great
 

3497
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:32,309
so world championship it's it's a great
parallel to

3498
01:02:32,309 --> 01:02:32,319
parallel to
 

3499
01:02:32,319 --> 01:02:33,589
parallel to
to football

3500
01:02:33,589 --> 01:02:33,599
to football
 

3501
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:36,470
to football
because it's a low scoring game

3502
01:02:36,470 --> 01:02:36,480
because it's a low scoring game
 

3503
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:37,589
because it's a low scoring game
and

3504
01:02:37,589 --> 01:02:37,599
and
 

3505
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:38,789
and
if the better

3506
01:02:38,789 --> 01:02:38,799
if the better
 

3507
01:02:38,799 --> 01:02:41,270
if the better
player or the better team scores

3508
01:02:41,270 --> 01:02:41,280
player or the better team scores
 

3509
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:42,710
player or the better team scores
they win

3510
01:02:42,710 --> 01:02:42,720
they win
 

3511
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:45,029
they win
most of the time oh that's generally for

3512
01:02:45,029 --> 01:02:45,039
most of the time oh that's generally for
 

3513
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:47,190
most of the time oh that's generally for
for big for championships or in general

3514
01:02:47,190 --> 01:02:47,200
for big for championships or in general
 

3515
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:49,029
for big for championships or in general
yeah for championships like they

3516
01:02:49,029 --> 01:02:49,039
yeah for championships like they
 

3517
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:50,069
yeah for championships like they
generally

3518
01:02:50,069 --> 01:02:50,079
generally
 

3519
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:53,349
generally
generally win uh because the other

3520
01:02:53,349 --> 01:02:53,359
generally win uh because the other
 

3521
01:02:53,359 --> 01:02:55,670
generally win uh because the other
slightly weaker team they're good enough

3522
01:02:55,670 --> 01:02:55,680
slightly weaker team they're good enough
 

3523
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:56,470
slightly weaker team they're good enough
to

3524
01:02:56,470 --> 01:02:56,480
to
 

3525
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:59,029
to
defend to make it very very difficult

3526
01:02:59,029 --> 01:02:59,039
defend to make it very very difficult
 

3527
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:00,789
defend to make it very very difficult
for the others but when they actually

3528
01:03:00,789 --> 01:03:00,799
for the others but when they actually
 

3529
01:03:00,799 --> 01:03:02,950
for the others but when they actually
have to create the chances then they

3530
01:03:02,950 --> 01:03:02,960
have to create the chances then they
 

3531
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:05,109
have to create the chances then they
have no chance and then it very often

3532
01:03:05,109 --> 01:03:05,119
have no chance and then it very often
 

3533
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:08,069
have no chance and then it very often
ends with a blowout as it did in our our

3534
01:03:08,069 --> 01:03:08,079
ends with a blowout as it did in our our
 

3535
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:10,710
ends with a blowout as it did in our our
match if i hadn't won game six it

3536
01:03:10,710 --> 01:03:10,720
match if i hadn't won game six it
 

3537
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:13,109
match if i hadn't won game six it
probably would have been very very close

3538
01:03:13,109 --> 01:03:13,119
probably would have been very very close
 

3539
01:03:13,119 --> 01:03:14,630
probably would have been very very close
he might have edged it

3540
01:03:14,630 --> 01:03:14,640
he might have edged it
 

3541
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:16,710
he might have edged it
there's obviously a bigger chance that i

3542
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:16,720
there's obviously a bigger chance that i
 

3543
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:18,950
there's obviously a bigger chance that i
i would have edged it but this is just

3544
01:03:18,950 --> 01:03:18,960
i would have edged it but this is just
 

3545
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:21,589
i would have edged it but this is just
what happens a lot in in chess but also

3546
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:21,599
what happens a lot in in chess but also
 

3547
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:23,990
what happens a lot in in chess but also
in in football that matches our clothes

3548
01:03:23,990 --> 01:03:24,000
in in football that matches our clothes
 

3549
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,190
in in football that matches our clothes
and then

3550
01:03:25,190 --> 01:03:25,200
and then
 

3551
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:26,069
and then
they

3552
01:03:26,069 --> 01:03:26,079
they
 

3553
01:03:26,079 --> 01:03:28,230
they
somebody scores somebody scores and

3554
01:03:28,230 --> 01:03:28,240
somebody scores somebody scores and
 

3555
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:30,950
somebody scores somebody scores and
things things changed and this gives

3556
01:03:30,950 --> 01:03:30,960
things things changed and this gives
 

3557
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:32,630
things things changed and this gives
people the illusion

3558
01:03:32,630 --> 01:03:32,640
people the illusion
 

3559
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:34,710
people the illusion
that the matchup was very close

3560
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:34,720
that the matchup was very close
 

3561
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:35,910
that the matchup was very close
yeah which

3562
01:03:35,910 --> 01:03:35,920
yeah which
 

3563
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:38,789
yeah which
while actually it just means that

3564
01:03:38,789 --> 01:03:38,799
while actually it just means that
 

3565
01:03:38,799 --> 01:03:41,510
while actually it just means that
the nature of the game makes

3566
01:03:41,510 --> 01:03:41,520
the nature of the game makes
 

3567
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:44,069
the nature of the game makes
the matches close very often but it's

3568
01:03:44,069 --> 01:03:44,079
the matches close very often but it's
 

3569
01:03:44,079 --> 01:03:45,190
the matches close very often but it's
always

3570
01:03:45,190 --> 01:03:45,200
always
 

3571
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:47,430
always
much more likely that one of the teams

3572
01:03:47,430 --> 01:03:47,440
much more likely that one of the teams
 

3573
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:49,349
much more likely that one of the teams
is gonna or one of the players is gonna

3574
01:03:49,349 --> 01:03:49,359
is gonna or one of the players is gonna
 

3575
01:03:49,359 --> 01:03:52,309
is gonna or one of the players is gonna
break away than the others and in other

3576
01:03:52,309 --> 01:03:52,319

that
essentially

3594
01:04:10,390 --> 01:04:10,400
essentially
 

3595
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:13,349
essentially
the match was pretty pretty close like

3596
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:13,359
the match was pretty pretty close like
 

3597
01:04:13,359 --> 01:04:14,870
the match was pretty pretty close like
whatever uh

3598
01:04:14,870 --> 01:04:14,880
whatever uh
 

3599
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:18,069
whatever uh
60 40 or some people even stayed like 55

3600
01:04:18,069 --> 01:04:18,079
60 40 or some people even stayed like 55
 

3601
01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:21,349
60 40 or some people even stayed like 55
45 and what i felt was that the match

3602
01:04:21,349 --> 01:04:21,359
45 and what i felt was that the match
 

3603
01:04:21,359 --> 01:04:24,309
45 and what i felt was that the match
went very very wrong for me and

3604
01:04:24,309 --> 01:04:24,319
went very very wrong for me and
 

3605
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:25,829
went very very wrong for me and
i still won

3606
01:04:25,829 --> 01:04:25,839
i still won
 

3607
01:04:25,839 --> 01:04:27,510
i still won
and some people saw that as an

3608
01:04:27,510 --> 01:04:27,520
and some people saw that as an
 

3609
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:28,950
and some people saw that as an
indication that the pre-match

3610
01:04:28,950 --> 01:04:28,960
indication that the pre-match
 

3611
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:30,710
indication that the pre-match
probabilities were probably a bit closer

3612
01:04:30,710 --> 01:04:30,720
probabilities were probably a bit closer
 

3613
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:32,470
probabilities were probably a bit closer
than people thought well

3614
01:04:32,470 --> 01:04:32,480
than people thought well
 

3615
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:34,630
than people thought well
i would look at it in that in the way

3616
01:04:34,630 --> 01:04:34,640
i would look at it in that in the way
 

3617
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:36,789
i would look at it in that in the way
that everything went wrong and i i still

3618
01:04:36,789 --> 01:04:36,799
that everything went wrong and i i still
 

3619
01:04:36,799 --> 01:04:39,349
that everything went wrong and i i still
i still won which probably means i was

3620
01:04:39,349 --> 01:04:39,359
i still won which probably means i was
 

3621
01:04:39,359 --> 01:04:41,270
i still won which probably means i was
pretty big favorite to begin with i do

3622

pretty big favorite to begin with i do
 

3623

3857
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,990
would have happened but i was thinking
like the moment

3858
01:08:41,990 --> 01:08:42,000
like the moment
 

3859
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,590
like the moment
that i realized that i'm not the best

3860
01:08:43,590 --> 01:08:43,600
that i realized that i'm not the best

i just remember i can't remember much of
 

3965
01:10:34,719 --> 01:10:36,630
i just remember i can't remember much of
it just that when it was over i was just

3966
01:10:36,630 --> 01:10:36,640
it just that when it was over i was just
 

3967
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:37,590
it just that when it was over i was just
so

3968
01:10:37,590 --> 01:10:37,600
so
 

3969
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:39,669
so
relieved because then it was clear the

3970

relieved because then it was clear the
 

3971

relieved because then it was clear the
position was probably gonna

3972
01:10:41,430 --> 01:10:41,440
position was probably gonna
 

3973
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:44,870
position was probably gonna

players in the world
 

4013
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:27,430
players in the world
and you don't for each round you don't

4014
01:11:27,430 --> 01:11:27,440
and you don't for each round you don't

4019
01:11:30,239 --> 01:11:31,510
would be
that's an interesting question you know

4020
01:11:31,510 --> 01:11:31,520
that's an interesting question you know
 

4021
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:33,350
that's an interesting question you know
like there's these like videos where

4022
01:11:33,350 --> 01:11:33,360
like there's these like videos where
 

4023
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:35,669
like there's these like videos where
people eat mcdonald's the burger king or

like from the style of play do you think

4032
01:11:44,630 --> 01:11:44,640
like from the style of play do you think
 

4033
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:48,390
like from the style of play do you think
um or from the strength of play

4034
01:11:48,390 --> 01:11:48,400

 

4035
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:50,630

if there was a decent sample size sure

4036
01:11:50,630 --> 01:11:50,640
if there was a decent sample size sure
 

4037
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:52,149
if there was a decent sample size sure
uh and what about you would you be able

4038
01:11:52,149 --> 01:11:52,159
uh and what about you would you be able
 

4039
01:11:52,159 --> 01:11:55,110
uh and what about you would you be able
to tell uh others

4040
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:55,120
to tell uh others
 

4041
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:58,149
to tell uh others
in like one game

4042
01:11:58,149 --> 01:11:58,159
in like one game
 

4043
01:11:58,159 --> 01:12:00,070
in like one game
very unlikely what what sample size

4044
01:12:00,070 --> 01:12:00,080
very unlikely what what sample size
 

4045
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:02,310
very unlikely what what sample size
would you need to tell accurately i feel

4046
01:12:02,310 --> 01:12:02,320
would you need to tell accurately i feel
 

4047
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:04,709
would you need to tell accurately i feel
like that's the science yeah i

4048
01:12:04,709 --> 01:12:04,719
like that's the science yeah i
 

4049
01:12:04,719 --> 01:12:06,790
like that's the science yeah i
i think 20 games would help a lot per

4050
01:12:06,790 --> 01:12:06,800
i think 20 games would help a lot per
 

4051
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:09,030
i think 20 games would help a lot per
person yeah

01:12:09,030 --> 01:12:09,040
person yeah
 

4053
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:09,830
person yeah
but

4054
01:12:09,830 --> 01:12:09,840
but
 

4055
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:13,110
but
i know that they've already developed ai

4056
01:12:13,110 --> 01:12:13,120
i know that they've already developed ai
 

4057

somebody's style

4060
01:12:16,790 --> 01:12:16,800
somebody's style
 

4061
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:19,430
somebody's style
okay which is um which is quite

4062
01:12:19,430 --> 01:12:19,440
okay which is um which is quite
 

4063
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:20,230
okay which is um which is quite
fascinating

4064
01:12:20,230 --> 01:12:20,240
fascinating
 

4065
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:21,830

4067
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:23,669

it'd be fascinating if those bots were

4068
01:12:23,669 --> 01:12:23,679
it'd be fascinating if those bots were
 

4069
01:12:23,679 --> 01:12:25,830
it'd be fascinating if those bots were
able to summarize the style somehow

4070
01:12:25,830 --> 01:12:25,840
able to summarize the style somehow
 

4071
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:28,630
able to summarize the style somehow

line calculations all that kind of stuff

4078
01:12:34,149 --> 01:12:34,159
line calculations all that kind of stuff
 

4079
01:12:34,159 --> 01:12:37,590
line calculations all that kind of stuff
yeah

4080
01:12:37,590 --> 01:12:37,600

4089
01:12:45,199 --> 01:12:47,030
or
or shorter lines it's the hair and the

4090
01:12:47,030 --> 01:12:47,040
or shorter lines it's the hair and the
 

4091
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:49,270
or shorter lines it's the hair and the
tortoise basically

4092
01:12:49,270 --> 01:12:49,280
tortoise basically
 

4093
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:51,750
tortoise basically
and sometimes you know

4094
01:12:51,750 --> 01:12:51,760
and sometimes you know
 

4095
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:53,350
and sometimes you know
i feel like i'm

4096
01:12:53,350 --> 01:12:53,360
i feel like i'm
 

4097

the closest you can get to a a hybrid of

4098
01:12:57,189 --> 01:12:57,199
the closest you can get to a a hybrid of
 

4099
01:12:57,199 --> 01:12:58,550
the closest you can get to a a hybrid of
those

4100
01:12:58,550 --> 01:12:58,560
those
 

4101
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:00,390
those
because you got both the

4102
01:13:00,390 --> 01:13:00,400
because you got both the
 

4103
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:02,470
because you got both the
you're good in every position the middle

4104
01:13:02,470 --> 01:13:02,480
you're good in every position the middle
 

4105
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:04,390
you're good in every position the middle
game and the end game yeah and also i

4106
01:13:04,390 --> 01:13:04,400
game and the end game yeah and also i
 

4107
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:07,350
game and the end game yeah and also i
can i can think to some extent both

4108
01:13:07,350 --> 01:13:07,360
can i can think to some extent both
 

4109
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:10,550
can i can think to some extent both
rapidly and deeply which a lot of people

4110
01:13:10,550 --> 01:13:10,560
rapidly and deeply which a lot of people
 

4111
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:12,950
rapidly and deeply which a lot of people
they can't do both um but i mean to to

4112
01:13:12,950 --> 01:13:12,960
they can't do both um but i mean to to
 

4113

yeah i sometimes can get a little bit

4116
01:13:17,430 --> 01:13:17,440
yeah i sometimes can get a little bit
 

4117
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:21,110
yeah i sometimes can get a little bit
intimidated by my opponent but

4118
01:13:21,110 --> 01:13:21,120

 

4119
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:23,430

it's mostly if there's something unknown

4120
01:13:23,430 --> 01:13:23,440
it's mostly if there's something unknown
 

4121

i
don't understand fully and i do think

4126
01:13:29,189 --> 01:13:29,199
don't understand fully and i do think
 

4127
01:13:29,199 --> 01:13:30,790
don't understand fully and i do think
especially when i'm playing

4128
01:13:30,790 --> 01:13:30,800
especially when i'm playing
 

4129
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:33,590
especially when i'm playing
while people they just play more timidly

4130
01:13:33,590 --> 01:13:33,600
while people they just play more timidly
 

4131
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:35,590
while people they just play more timidly
against me than they do against each

4132
01:13:35,590 --> 01:13:35,600
against me than they do against each
 

4133
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:37,510
against me than they do against each
other sometimes

4134
01:13:37,510 --> 01:13:37,520
other sometimes
 

4135
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:40,470
other sometimes
without even realizing it and i

4136
01:13:40,470 --> 01:13:40,480
without even realizing it and i
 

4137
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:43,110
without even realizing it and i
certainly use that to my my advantage if

4138
01:13:43,110 --> 01:13:43,120
certainly use that to my my advantage if
 

4139
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:45,510
certainly use that to my my advantage if
i sense that my opponent is

4140
01:13:45,510 --> 01:13:45,520
i sense that my opponent is
 

4141
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:48,229
i sense that my opponent is
apprehensive if i sense that

4142
01:13:48,229 --> 01:13:48,239
apprehensive if i sense that
 

4143
01:13:48,239 --> 01:13:49,990
apprehensive if i sense that
they are not going to necessarily take

4144
01:13:49,990 --> 01:13:50,000
they are not going to necessarily take
 

4145
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,990
they are not going to necessarily take
all their chances it just means that i

4146
01:13:51,990 --> 01:13:52,000
all their chances it just means that i
 

4147
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,350
all their chances it just means that i
can take more risk

4148
01:13:53,350 --> 01:13:53,360
can take more risk
 

4149
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:54,950
can take more risk
and um

4150
01:13:54,950 --> 01:13:54,960
and um
 

4151
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:57,750
and um
i always try and try and find that

4152
01:13:57,750 --> 01:13:57,760
i always try and try and find that
 

4153
01:13:57,760 --> 01:13:59,590
i always try and try and find that

balance to shake them up a little bit
 

4155
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:02,390
balance to shake them up a little bit
yeah what what's been the toughest loss

4156

uh
before that game in terms of game one

4176
01:14:23,590 --> 01:14:23,600
before that game in terms of game one
 

4177
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:26,070
before that game in terms of game one
through seven

4178

through seven
 

4179
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:27,990
through seven
yeah so game one and two not much

4180
01:14:27,990 --> 01:14:28,000
yeah so game one and two not much
 

4181
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:31,270
yeah so game one and two not much
happened uh games three and four i was

4182
01:14:31,270 --> 01:14:31,280
happened uh games three and four i was
 

4183
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:34,149
happened uh games three and four i was
winning in both of them and um

4184
01:14:34,149 --> 01:14:34,159
winning in both of them and um
 

4185
01:14:34,159 --> 01:14:36,709
winning in both of them and um
normally i should definitely converted

4186
01:14:36,709 --> 01:14:36,719
normally i should definitely converted
 

4187
01:14:36,719 --> 01:14:37,830
normally i should definitely converted
both

4188
01:14:37,830 --> 01:14:37,840
both
 

4189
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:40,830
both
i couldn't partly due

4190
01:14:40,830 --> 01:14:40,840
i couldn't partly due
 

4191
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:44,149
i couldn't partly due
to good defense on his part but mostly

4192
01:14:44,149 --> 01:14:44,159
to good defense on his part but mostly
 

4193
01:14:44,159 --> 01:14:45,189
to good defense on his part but mostly
because

4194
01:14:45,189 --> 01:14:45,199
because
 

4195
01:14:45,199 --> 01:14:46,630
because
i just

4196
01:14:46,630 --> 01:14:46,640
i just
 

4197
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:48,709
i just
i messed up

4198
01:14:48,709 --> 01:14:48,719
i messed up
 

4199
01:14:48,719 --> 01:14:50,790
i messed up
and then after that

4200
01:14:50,790 --> 01:14:50,800
and then after that
 

4201
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:52,709
and then after that
games five

4202
01:14:52,709 --> 01:14:52,719
games five
 

4203
01:14:52,719 --> 01:14:55,350
games five
six and seven not much

4204
01:14:55,350 --> 01:14:55,360
six and seven not much
 

4205
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:58,790
six and seven not much
happened i was getting impatient that

4206
01:14:58,790 --> 01:14:58,800
happened i was getting impatient that
 

4207
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:02,390
happened i was getting impatient that
at that point um so for

4208
01:15:02,390 --> 01:15:02,400
at that point um so for
 

4209
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:04,790
at that point um so for
game eight i was probably ready to take

4210
01:15:04,790 --> 01:15:04,800
game eight i was probably ready to take
 

4211
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:07,510
game eight i was probably ready to take
a little bit more risks than i i had

4212
01:15:07,510 --> 01:15:07,520
a little bit more risks than i i had
 

4213
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:09,430
a little bit more risks than i i had
before which

4214
01:15:09,430 --> 01:15:09,440
before which
 

4215
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:13,669
before which
i guess was insane because i knew that

4216
01:15:13,669 --> 01:15:13,679
i guess was insane because i knew that
 

4217
01:15:13,679 --> 01:15:17,830
i guess was insane because i knew that
he couldn't beat me unless i beat myself

4218
01:15:17,830 --> 01:15:17,840

 

4219
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:19,430

like he wasn't strong enough to outplay

4220
01:15:19,430 --> 01:15:19,440
like he wasn't strong enough to outplay
 

4221
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:20,390
like he wasn't strong enough to outplay
me

4222
01:15:20,390 --> 01:15:20,400

that's what happened in in 2021 as well
 

4235
01:15:32,719 --> 01:15:34,229
that's what happened in in 2021 as well
like when i won the first game against

01:16:01,350 --> 01:16:01,360
defensively i was watching i wasn't
 

4261
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:03,510
defensively i was watching i wasn't
really crossing into his half at the

4262
01:16:03,510 --> 01:16:03,520
really crossing into his half at the
 

4263
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:05,430
really crossing into his half at the
start at all i was just

4264
01:16:05,430 --> 01:16:05,440
start at all i was just
 

4265
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:08,310
start at all i was just
i played more like a system more

4266
01:16:08,310 --> 01:16:08,320
i played more like a system more
 

4267
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:10,709
i played more like a system more
than like a concrete opening it was like

4268
01:16:10,709 --> 01:16:10,719
than like a concrete opening it was like
 

4269
01:16:10,719 --> 01:16:12,709
than like a concrete opening it was like
i'm gonna set up my pieces this way you

4270
01:16:12,709 --> 01:16:12,719
i'm gonna set up my pieces this way you
 

4271
01:16:12,719 --> 01:16:15,110
i'm gonna set up my pieces this way you
can set them up however you want and

4272
01:16:15,110 --> 01:16:15,120
can set them up however you want and
 

4273
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:17,430
can set them up however you want and
then later where sort of the armies are

4274
01:16:17,430 --> 01:16:17,440
then later where sort of the armies are
 

4275
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:19,510
then later where sort of the armies are
gonna meet i'm not gonna try and bother

4276
01:16:19,510 --> 01:16:19,520
gonna meet i'm not gonna try and bother
 

4277
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:21,910
gonna meet i'm not gonna try and bother
you at the start and that means

4278
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:21,920
you at the start and that means
 

4279
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:23,669
you at the start and that means
you can have with as many pieces as

4280
01:16:23,669 --> 01:16:23,679
you can have with as many pieces as
 

4281
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:25,110
you can have with as many pieces as
possible kind of pure chest in the

4282
01:16:25,110 --> 01:16:25,120
possible kind of pure chest in the
 

4283
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:26,310
possible kind of pure chest in the
middle game yeah

4284
01:16:26,310 --> 01:16:26,320
middle game yeah
 

4285
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:29,189
middle game yeah
without any of the the lines

4286
01:16:29,189 --> 01:16:29,199
without any of the the lines
 

4287
01:16:29,199 --> 01:16:31,189
without any of the the lines
the the standard lines in the opening

4288
01:16:31,189 --> 01:16:31,199
the the standard lines in the opening
 

4289
01:16:31,199 --> 01:16:32,229
the the standard lines in the opening
exactly

4290
01:16:32,229 --> 01:16:32,239
exactly
 

4291
01:16:32,239 --> 01:16:34,070
exactly
and so there was at some point a couple

4292
01:16:34,070 --> 01:16:34,080
and so there was at some point a couple
 

4293
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:37,270
and so there was at some point a couple
of exchanges then some maneuvering

4294
01:16:37,270 --> 01:16:37,280
of exchanges then some maneuvering
 

4295
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:39,590
of exchanges then some maneuvering
a little bit better then he was sort of

4296
01:16:39,590 --> 01:16:39,600
a little bit better then he was sort of
 

4297
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:41,110
a little bit better then he was sort of
equalizing and then i started to take

4298
01:16:41,110 --> 01:16:41,120
equalizing and then i started to take
 

4299
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:43,430
equalizing and then i started to take
too many risks and i was still sort of

4300
01:16:43,430 --> 01:16:43,440
too many risks and i was still sort of
 

4301
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:46,790
too many risks and i was still sort of
fine um but

4302
01:16:46,790 --> 01:16:46,800
fine um but
 

4303
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:49,669
fine um but
then at some point i realized that

4304
01:16:49,669 --> 01:16:49,679
then at some point i realized that
 

4305
01:16:49,679 --> 01:16:51,350
then at some point i realized that
i'd gone a bit too far and i had to be

4306
01:16:51,350 --> 01:16:51,360
i'd gone a bit too far and i had to be
 

4307
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:53,990
i'd gone a bit too far and i had to be
really careful then i just froze

4308
01:16:53,990 --> 01:16:54,000
really careful then i just froze
 

4309
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,630
really careful then i just froze
i just completely froze

4310
01:16:56,630 --> 01:16:56,640
i just completely froze
 

4311
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:59,910
i just completely froze
uh mentally yeah mentally what happened

4312
01:16:59,910 --> 01:16:59,920
uh mentally yeah mentally what happened
 

4313
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:02,310
uh mentally yeah mentally what happened
i realized that i mean all the thoughts

4314
01:17:02,310 --> 01:17:02,320
i realized that i mean all the thoughts
 

4315
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:04,070
i realized that i mean all the thoughts
of

4316
01:17:04,070 --> 01:17:04,080
of
 

4317
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:07,350
of
i might lose this what have i done

4318
01:17:07,350 --> 01:17:07,360
i might lose this what have i done
 

4319
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:09,110
i might lose this what have i done
why did i take so many risks i knew that

4320
01:17:09,110 --> 01:17:09,120
why did i take so many risks i knew that
 

4321
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:11,430
why did i take so many risks i knew that
i could have drawn at any moment just be

4322
01:17:11,430 --> 01:17:11,440
i could have drawn at any moment just be
 

4323
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:13,350
i could have drawn at any moment just be
patient don't

4324
01:17:13,350 --> 01:17:13,360
patient don't
 

4325
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:15,430
patient don't
give him these opportunities

4326
01:17:15,430 --> 01:17:15,440
give him these opportunities
 

4327
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:17,990
give him these opportunities
what triggered that like face transition

4328
01:17:17,990 --> 01:17:18,000
what triggered that like face transition
 

4329
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,229
what triggered that like face transition
in your mind no it was one thing or no

4330
01:17:20,229 --> 01:17:20,239
in your mind no it was one thing or no
 

4331
01:17:20,239 --> 01:17:22,550
in your mind no it was one thing or no
it was just a position on the board like

4332
01:17:22,550 --> 01:17:22,560
it was just a position on the board like
 

4333
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:24,310
it was just a position on the board like
realizing like there was one particular

4334
01:17:24,310 --> 01:17:24,320
realizing like there was one particular
 

4335
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:26,470
realizing like there was one particular
move he played that i missed and then

4336
01:17:26,470 --> 01:17:26,480
move he played that i missed and then
 

4337
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:27,270
move he played that i missed and then
like

4338
01:17:27,270 --> 01:17:27,280
like
 

4339
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:30,310
like
and then i i realized that this could

4340
01:17:30,310 --> 01:17:30,320
and then i i realized that this could
 

4341
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:33,270
and then i i realized that this could
potentially not go go my way so then i

4342
01:17:33,270 --> 01:17:33,280
potentially not go go my way so then i
 

4343
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:36,390
potentially not go go my way so then i
made another couple of mistakes and he

4344
01:17:36,390 --> 01:17:36,400
made another couple of mistakes and he
 

4345
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:38,550
made another couple of mistakes and he
to his credit like once he realized he

4346
01:17:38,550 --> 01:17:38,560
to his credit like once he realized he
 

4347
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:40,550
to his credit like once he realized he
had the chance he was

4348
01:17:40,550 --> 01:17:40,560
had the chance he was
 

4349
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:41,270
had the chance he was
like

4350
01:17:41,270 --> 01:17:41,280
like
 

4351
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:43,350
like
he knew that this was his one chance he

4352
01:17:43,350 --> 01:17:43,360
he knew that this was his one chance he
 

4353
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:44,790
he knew that this was his one chance he
had to take it

4354
01:17:44,790 --> 01:17:44,800
had to take it
 

4355
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:46,550
had to take it
and so he did

4356
01:17:46,550 --> 01:17:46,560
and so he did
 

4357
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:48,229
and so he did
and

4358
01:17:48,229 --> 01:17:48,239
and
 

4359
01:17:48,239 --> 01:17:50,390
and
yeah that's that's the the worst i've

4360
01:17:50,390 --> 01:17:50,400
yeah that's that's the the worst i've
 

4361
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:52,229
yeah that's that's the the worst i've
ever felt after

4362
01:17:52,229 --> 01:17:52,239
ever felt after
 

4363
01:17:52,239 --> 01:17:55,430
ever felt after
um after a chess game i realized that

4364
01:17:55,430 --> 01:17:55,440
um after a chess game i realized that
 

4365
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:58,149
um after a chess game i realized that
i'm probably gonna lose my title against

4366
01:17:58,149 --> 01:17:58,159
i'm probably gonna lose my title against
 

4367
01:17:58,159 --> 01:18:00,149
i'm probably gonna lose my title against
somebody who's not even close to my

4368
01:18:00,149 --> 01:18:00,159
somebody who's not even close to my
 

4369
01:18:00,159 --> 01:18:01,910
somebody who's not even close to my
level

4370
01:18:01,910 --> 01:18:01,920
level
 

4371
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:05,830
level
and i've done it because of my own

4372
01:18:05,830 --> 01:18:05,840
and i've done it because of my own
 

4373
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:07,990
and i've done it because of my own
stupidity most of all

4374
01:18:07,990 --> 01:18:08,000
stupidity most of all
 

4375
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,790
stupidity most of all
and that was

4376
01:18:10,790 --> 01:18:10,800
and that was
 

4377
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:12,790
and that was
really really um

4378
01:18:12,790 --> 01:18:12,800
really really um
 

4379
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:15,430
really really um
at the time like i was all in my

4380
01:18:15,430 --> 01:18:15,440
at the time like i was all in my
 

4381
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:16,950
at the time like i was all in my

a loss even though it's really really
unpleasant so

01:26:59,830 --> 01:26:59,840
uh twice a day but i just the mind is
 

4863
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:03,350
uh twice a day but i just the mind is
most focused and like really difficult

4864
01:27:03,350 --> 01:27:03,360
most focused and like really difficult
 

4865
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:06,070
most focused and like really difficult
thinking tasks when it's fasted it's an

4866
01:27:06,070 --> 01:27:06,080
thinking tasks when it's fasted it's an
 

4867
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:07,910
thinking tasks when it's fasted it's an
interesting a lot of people kind of talk

4868
01:27:07,910 --> 01:27:07,920
interesting a lot of people kind of talk
 

4869
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:09,110
interesting a lot of people kind of talk
about that

4870
01:27:09,110 --> 01:27:09,120
about that
 

4871
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:10,790
about that
yeah but you're able to kind of like

4872
01:27:10,790 --> 01:27:10,800
yeah but you're able to kind of like
 

4873
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:12,709
yeah but you're able to kind of like
zoom in and if you're doing a low carb

4874
01:27:12,709 --> 01:27:12,719
zoom in and if you're doing a low carb
 

4875
01:27:12,719 --> 01:27:14,390
zoom in and if you're doing a low carb
diet you don't have this energy the

4876
01:27:14,390 --> 01:27:14,400
diet you don't have this energy the
 

4877
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:16,229
diet you don't have this energy the
energy stable no

4878
01:27:16,229 --> 01:27:16,239
energy stable no
 

4879
01:27:16,239 --> 01:27:17,510
energy stable no
that is true maybe that would be

4880
01:27:17,510 --> 01:27:17,520
that is true maybe that would be
 

4881
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:19,910
that is true maybe that would be
interesting to try so what's happened

4882
01:27:19,910 --> 01:27:19,920
interesting to try so what's happened
 

4883
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:22,070
interesting to try so what's happened
for me if i played a few tournaments

4884
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:22,080
for me if i played a few tournaments
 

4885
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:24,390
for me if i played a few tournaments
where i've had food poisoning

4886
01:27:24,390 --> 01:27:24,400
where i've had food poisoning
 

4887
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:26,229
where i've had food poisoning
and then that generally means that

4888
01:27:26,229 --> 01:27:26,239
and then that generally means that
 

4889
01:27:26,239 --> 01:27:29,189
and then that generally means that
you're both sleep deprived and you have

4890
01:27:29,189 --> 01:27:29,199
you're both sleep deprived and you have
 

4891
01:27:29,199 --> 01:27:32,870
you're both sleep deprived and you have
no energy yeah and what i've found is

4892
01:27:32,870 --> 01:27:32,880
no energy yeah and what i've found is
 

4893
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:35,270
no energy yeah and what i've found is
that

4894
01:27:35,270 --> 01:27:35,280

 

4895
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:37,110

it makes me to some it makes me very

4896
01:27:37,110 --> 01:27:37,120
it makes me to some it makes me very
 

4897
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:39,270
it makes me to some it makes me very
calm of course because i don't have

4898
01:27:39,270 --> 01:27:39,280
calm of course because i don't have
 

4899
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:41,669
calm of course because i don't have
the energy and it makes me super

4900
01:27:41,669 --> 01:27:41,679
the energy and it makes me super
 

4901
01:27:41,679 --> 01:27:42,629
the energy and it makes me super
creative

4902
01:27:42,629 --> 01:27:42,639
creative
 

4903
01:27:42,639 --> 01:27:44,149
creative
like interesting being sleep deep

4904
01:27:44,149 --> 01:27:44,159
like interesting being sleep deep
 

4905
01:27:44,159 --> 01:27:45,750
like interesting being sleep deep
probably i think in general makes you

4906
01:27:45,750 --> 01:27:45,760
probably i think in general makes you
 

4907
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:47,110
probably i think in general makes you
creative

4908
01:27:47,110 --> 01:27:47,120
creative
 

4909
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:48,950
creative
just the first thing that goes away is

4910
01:27:48,950 --> 01:27:48,960
just the first thing that goes away is
 

4911
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:51,669
just the first thing that goes away is
the ability to do the simple things

4912
01:27:51,669 --> 01:27:51,679
the ability to do the simple things
 

4913
01:27:51,679 --> 01:27:53,990
the ability to do the simple things
that that's that's what if it affects

4914
01:27:53,990 --> 01:27:54,000
that that's that's what if it affects
 

4915
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,390
that that's that's what if it affects
you the most like you cannot be precise

4916
01:27:56,390 --> 01:27:56,400
you the most like you cannot be precise
 

4917
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:58,149
you the most like you cannot be precise
so i'm that's the only thing i'm worried

4918
01:27:58,149 --> 01:27:58,159
so i'm that's the only thing i'm worried
 

4919
01:27:58,159 --> 01:28:01,270
so i'm that's the only thing i'm worried
about like if if i'm faster that i won't

4920
01:28:01,270 --> 01:28:01,280
about like if if i'm faster that i won't
 

4921
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:02,149
about like if if i'm faster that i won't
be

4922
01:28:02,149 --> 01:28:02,159
be
 

4923
01:28:02,159 --> 01:28:03,480
be
it won't be

4924
01:28:03,480 --> 01:28:03,490
it won't be
 

4925
01:28:03,490 --> 01:28:04,709
it won't be

but you might be more creative

4930
01:28:08,070 --> 01:28:08,080
but you might be more creative
 

4931
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:10,790
but you might be more creative
it's an interesting trusted yeah

4932
01:28:10,790 --> 01:28:10,800
it's an interesting trusted yeah
 

4933
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:13,350
it's an interesting trusted yeah
potentially what about you have been

4934
01:28:13,350 --> 01:28:13,360
potentially what about you have been
 

4935
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:16,470
potentially what about you have been
known to on a rare occasion play drunk

4936
01:28:16,470 --> 01:28:16,480
known to on a rare occasion play drunk
 

4937
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:19,270
known to on a rare occasion play drunk
is there mathematical formula for

4938
01:28:19,270 --> 01:28:19,280
is there mathematical formula for
 

4939
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:21,430
is there mathematical formula for
sort of on the x-axis how many drinks

4940
01:28:21,430 --> 01:28:21,440
sort of on the x-axis how many drinks
 

4941
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:23,910
sort of on the x-axis how many drinks
you had and then the y-axis

4942
01:28:23,910 --> 01:28:23,920
you had and then the y-axis
 

4943
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:26,790
you had and then the y-axis
your performance slash creativity is

4944
01:28:26,790 --> 01:28:26,800
your performance slash creativity is
 

4945
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:29,110
your performance slash creativity is
there like an optimal for like uh one of

4946
01:28:29,110 --> 01:28:29,120
there like an optimal for like uh one of
 

4947
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:30,709
there like an optimal for like uh one of
the would you suggest for the feeding

4948
01:28:30,709 --> 01:28:30,719
the would you suggest for the feeding
 

4949
01:28:30,719 --> 01:28:33,110
the would you suggest for the feeding
world championship that people would be

4950
01:28:33,110 --> 01:28:33,120
world championship that people would be
 

4951
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:34,550
world championship that people would be
required to drink would that change

4952
01:28:34,550 --> 01:28:34,560
required to drink would that change
 

4953
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:36,950
required to drink would that change
things in interesting ways yeah not at

4954
01:28:36,950 --> 01:28:36,960
things in interesting ways yeah not at
 

4955
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:38,229
things in interesting ways yeah not at
all um

4956
01:28:38,229 --> 01:28:38,239
all um
 

4957
01:28:38,239 --> 01:28:40,709
all um
maybe for rapid but for for blitz i

4958
01:28:40,709 --> 01:28:40,719
maybe for rapid but for for blitz i
 

4959
01:28:40,719 --> 01:28:41,910
maybe for rapid but for for blitz i
think if you're playing blitz you're

4960
01:28:41,910 --> 01:28:41,920
think if you're playing blitz you're
 

4961
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:44,790
think if you're playing blitz you're
mostly playing on

4962
01:28:44,790 --> 01:28:44,800
mostly playing on
 

4963
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:47,510
mostly playing on
on short calculation and intuition and i

4964
01:28:47,510 --> 01:28:47,520
on short calculation and intuition and i
 

4965
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:48,310
on short calculation and intuition and i
think

4966
01:28:48,310 --> 01:28:48,320
think
 

4967
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:50,790
think
those are probably enhanced if you've

4968
01:28:50,790 --> 01:28:50,800
those are probably enhanced if you've
 

4969
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:51,750
those are probably enhanced if you've
had

4970
01:28:51,750 --> 01:28:51,760
had
 

4971
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:54,070
had
a little bit of a little bit to drink

4972
01:28:54,070 --> 01:28:54,080
a little bit of a little bit to drink
 

4973
01:28:54,080 --> 01:28:56,709
a little bit of a little bit to drink
can you uh explain the uh

4974
01:28:56,709 --> 01:28:56,719
can you uh explain the uh
 

4975
01:28:56,719 --> 01:28:59,189
can you uh explain the uh
the physiology of why that's why it's

4976
01:28:59,189 --> 01:28:59,199
the physiology of why that's why it's
 

4977
01:28:59,199 --> 01:29:02,470
the physiology of why that's why it's
enhanced or the you're just you're

4978
01:29:02,470 --> 01:29:02,480
enhanced or the you're just you're
 

4979
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:04,629
enhanced or the you're just you're
thinking less you're more confident

4980
01:29:04,629 --> 01:29:04,639
thinking less you're more confident
 

4981
01:29:04,639 --> 01:29:05,990
thinking less you're more confident
oh yeah i think

4982
01:29:05,990 --> 01:29:06,000
oh yeah i think
 

4983
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,070
oh yeah i think
i think it's just confidence i think

4984
01:29:08,070 --> 01:29:08,080
i think it's just confidence i think
 

4985
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:10,550
i think it's just confidence i think
also like a lot of people

4986
01:29:10,550 --> 01:29:10,560
also like a lot of people
 

4987
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:13,350
also like a lot of people
feel like they're better at

4988
01:29:13,350 --> 01:29:13,360
feel like they're better at
 

4989
01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:15,270
feel like they're better at
speaking languages for instance if

4990
01:29:15,270 --> 01:29:15,280
speaking languages for instance if
 

4991
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:17,430
speaking languages for instance if
they've drunk a little bit it's just

4992
01:29:17,430 --> 01:29:17,440
they've drunk a little bit it's just
 

4993
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:19,990
they've drunk a little bit it's just
like removing these barriers yeah i

4994
01:29:19,990 --> 01:29:20,000
like removing these barriers yeah i
 

4995
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,950
like removing these barriers yeah i
think that it's it's a little bit of

4996
01:29:22,950 --> 01:29:22,960
think that it's it's a little bit of
 

4997
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:25,189
think that it's it's a little bit of
the same in inches

4998
01:29:25,189 --> 01:29:25,199
the same in inches
 

4999
01:29:25,199 --> 01:29:26,870
the same in inches
in 2012 i played the world bliss

5000
01:29:26,870 --> 01:29:26,880
in 2012 i played the world bliss
 

5001
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:28,870
in 2012 i played the world bliss
championship and then

5002
01:29:28,870 --> 01:29:28,880
championship and then
 

5003
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:31,590
championship and then
i i was doing horribly for

5004
01:29:31,590 --> 01:29:31,600
i i was doing horribly for
 

5005
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:33,669
i i was doing horribly for
for a long time i also had food

5006
01:29:33,669 --> 01:29:33,679
for a long time i also had food
 

5007
01:29:33,679 --> 01:29:35,830
for a long time i also had food
poisoning there i couldn't play at all

5008
01:29:35,830 --> 01:29:35,840
poisoning there i couldn't play at all
 

5009
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:38,310
poisoning there i couldn't play at all
for for three days so there before the

5010
01:29:38,310 --> 01:29:38,320
for for three days so there before the
 

5011
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:41,030
for for three days so there before the
last break i was like in the middle of

5012
01:29:41,030 --> 01:29:41,040
last break i was like in the middle of
 

5013
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:43,350
last break i was like in the middle of
the pack like in

5014
01:29:43,350 --> 01:29:43,360
the pack like in
 

5015
01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:45,110
the pack like in
i don't know

5016
01:29:45,110 --> 01:29:45,120
i don't know
 

5017
01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:47,750
i don't know
20th place or something and so i decided

5018
01:29:47,750 --> 01:29:47,760
20th place or something and so i decided
 

5019
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:48,629
20th place or something and so i decided
like

5020
01:29:48,629 --> 01:29:48,639

i wasn't playing nearly as well as i

5038
01:30:07,430 --> 01:30:07,440
i wasn't playing nearly as well as i
 

5039
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:08,550
i wasn't playing nearly as well as i
thought

5040
01:30:08,550 --> 01:30:08,560
thought
 

5041
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:10,709
thought
but it still helped me like i won my

5042
01:30:10,709 --> 01:30:10,719
but it still helped me like i won my
 

5043
01:30:10,719 --> 01:30:13,110
but it still helped me like i won my
remaining eight games and if

5044
01:30:13,110 --> 01:30:13,120
remaining eight games and if
 

5045
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:14,870
remaining eight games and if
there had been one more round i probably

5046
01:30:14,870 --> 01:30:14,880
there had been one more round i probably
 

5047
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:16,229
there had been one more round i probably
would have won the whole thing but

5048
01:30:16,229 --> 01:30:16,239
would have won the whole thing but
 

5049
01:30:16,239 --> 01:30:17,350
would have won the whole thing but
finally i was

5050
01:30:17,350 --> 01:30:17,360
finally i was
 

5051
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:19,350
finally i was
i was second so generally i wouldn't

5052
01:30:19,350 --> 01:30:19,360
i was second so generally i wouldn't
 

5053
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:20,790
i was second so generally i wouldn't
recommend that

5054
01:30:20,790 --> 01:30:20,800
recommend that
 

5055
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:23,030
recommend that
but maybe as the last resort sometimes

5056
01:30:23,030 --> 01:30:23,040
but maybe as the last resort sometimes
 

5057
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:24,790
but maybe as the last resort sometimes
like if you feel that you have the

5058
01:30:24,790 --> 01:30:24,800
like if you feel that you have the
 

5059
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:27,990
like if you feel that you have the
ability like obviously none of this

5060
01:30:27,990 --> 01:30:28,000
ability like obviously none of this
 

5061
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:29,910
ability like obviously none of this
is remotely relevant if you don't feel

5062
01:30:29,910 --> 01:30:29,920
is remotely relevant if you don't feel
 

5063
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:31,590
is remotely relevant if you don't feel
like you have the ability to begin with

5064
01:30:31,590 --> 01:30:31,600
like you have the ability to begin with
 

5065
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:32,790
like you have the ability to begin with
but if you like if you feel like you

5066
01:30:32,790 --> 01:30:32,800
but if you like if you feel like you
 

5067
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:35,590
but if you like if you feel like you
have the ability there are just factors

5068
01:30:35,590 --> 01:30:35,600
have the ability there are just factors
 

5069
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:38,229
have the ability there are just factors
that

5070
01:30:38,229 --> 01:30:38,239

 

5071
01:30:38,239 --> 01:30:41,430

make it impossible for you to um

5072
01:30:41,430 --> 01:30:41,440
make it impossible for you to um
 

5073
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:43,510
make it impossible for you to um
to show it like numbing your mind a bit

5074
01:30:43,510 --> 01:30:43,520
to show it like numbing your mind a bit
 

5075
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:45,590
to show it like numbing your mind a bit
can probably be a good thing yeah what's

can probably be a good thing yeah what's
 

5077
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:47,270
can probably be a good thing yeah what's
interesting is especially during

5078
01:30:47,270 --> 01:30:47,280
interesting is especially during
 

5079
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:50,149
interesting is especially during

5631
01:40:35,199 --> 01:40:37,510
you know i'll go on
change it so that's easier to figure out

5632
01:40:37,510 --> 01:40:37,520
change it so that's easier to figure out

of time specifically studying his games
it was super intimidating because

5804
01:43:51,750 --> 01:43:51,760
it was super intimidating because
 

5805
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:54,149
it was super intimidating because
a lot of these openings i knew

5806
01:43:54,149 --> 01:43:54,159
a lot of these openings i knew
 

5807
01:43:54,159 --> 01:43:56,229
a lot of these openings i knew
i was like oh he was the first one to

5808
01:43:56,229 --> 01:43:56,239
i was like oh he was the first one to
 

5809
01:43:56,239 --> 01:43:57,830
i was like oh he was the first one to
play that oh that was his idea i

5810
01:43:57,830 --> 01:43:57,840
play that oh that was his idea i
 

5811
01:43:57,840 --> 01:43:59,510
play that oh that was his idea i
actually didn't know that

5812
01:43:59,510 --> 01:43:59,520
actually didn't know that
 

5813
01:43:59,520 --> 01:44:01,510
actually didn't know that
so i was a bit intimidated before we

5814
01:44:01,510 --> 01:44:01,520
so i was a bit intimidated before we

played then of course the first game
he

5818
01:44:05,590 --> 01:44:05,600

5819
01:44:05,600 --> 01:44:07,830
he

never made sense for me to broach the
subject with him

no matter how beautiful like that moment
 

5999
01:47:10,880 --> 01:47:12,310
no matter how beautiful like that moment
is because it's like

6000
01:47:12,310 --> 01:47:12,320
is because it's like
 

6001
01:47:12,320 --> 01:47:13,910
is because it's like
it in in a way it's the passing of the

6002
01:47:13,910 --> 01:47:13,920
it in in a way it's the passing of the
 

6003
01:47:13,920 --> 01:47:16,310
it in in a way it's the passing of the
baton from like one great champion to

6004
01:47:16,310 --> 01:47:16,320
baton from like one great champion to
 

6005

01:47:20,149 --> 01:47:20,159
still just don't like the fact that you
 

6009
01:47:20,159 --> 01:47:21,830
still just don't like the fact that you
didn't play a good game from gary's

6010
01:47:21,830 --> 01:47:21,840
didn't play a good game from gary's
 

6011

perspective like he still was just
 

6013
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:26,310
perspective like he still was just
annoyed probably that yeah he could have

6014
01:47:26,310 --> 01:47:26,320
annoyed probably that yeah he could have
 

6015
01:47:26,320 --> 01:47:28,629
annoyed probably that yeah he could have
played better and we did

6016
01:47:28,629 --> 01:47:28,639
played better and we did
 

6017

that corporation ended um
early 2010 but we did play a lot of

6026
01:47:40,070 --> 01:47:40,080
early 2010 but we did play a lot of
 

6027

early 2010 but we did play a lot of
training games

6028
01:47:41,350 --> 01:47:41,360
training games
 

6029
01:47:41,360 --> 01:47:43,669

i'm always skeptical of those who said
 

6085
01:48:42,080 --> 01:48:44,070
i'm always skeptical of those who said
that they knew that i was gonna be world

that they knew that i was gonna be world

all at that time i mean
 

6091
01:48:49,199 --> 01:48:50,790
all at that time i mean
it was easy to see that i would become a

6092
01:48:50,790 --> 01:48:50,800
it was easy to see that i would become a
 

6093
01:48:50,800 --> 01:48:53,030
it was easy to see that i would become a
very very strong player uh everybody

most of the time we're trying to project

6122
01:49:22,629 --> 01:49:22,639
most of the time we're trying to project
 

6123
01:49:22,639 --> 01:49:25,270
most of the time we're trying to project
we see a young kid being an older person

6124
01:49:25,270 --> 01:49:25,280
we see a young kid being an older person
 

6125
01:49:25,280 --> 01:49:26,950
we see a young kid being an older person
you just start to think okay this could

6126
01:49:26,950 --> 01:49:26,960
you just start to think okay this could
 

6127
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:28,790
you just start to think okay this could
be the next great person then we forget

6128
01:49:28,790 --> 01:49:28,800
be the next great person then we forget
 

6129
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:30,950
be the next great person then we forget
when they don't become that yeah exactly

6130
01:49:30,950 --> 01:49:30,960
when they don't become that yeah exactly
 

6131
01:49:30,960 --> 01:49:33,109
when they don't become that yeah exactly
that's i think what happens

6132
01:49:33,109 --> 01:49:33,119
that's i think what happens
 

6133
01:49:33,119 --> 01:49:34,629
that's i think what happens
but when it does maybe

6134
01:49:34,629 --> 01:49:34,639
but when it does maybe
 

6135
01:49:34,639 --> 01:49:37,750
but when it does maybe
or maybe some people are just

6136
01:49:37,750 --> 01:49:37,760

and others have was

01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:07,350
and others have was
greater than it's ever been

greater than it's ever been
 

6221
01:51:07,360 --> 01:51:09,750
greater than it's ever been
in history at any other time uh and that

in history at any other time uh and that
 

6223
01:51:09,760 --> 01:51:11,669
in history at any other time uh and that
would be the argument for

6224
01:51:11,669 --> 01:51:11,679
would be the argument for
 

6225
01:51:11,679 --> 01:51:12,709
would be the argument for
for him

would say for
almost 20 years which nobody else has

6242

almost 20 years which nobody else has

he um was not quite the level of um

6252
01:51:45,350 --> 01:51:45,360
he um was not quite the level of um
 

6253
01:51:45,360 --> 01:51:47,990
he um was not quite the level of um
of fisher in terms of the gap but it was

6254
01:51:47,990 --> 01:51:48,000
of fisher in terms of the gap but it was
 

6255
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,790
of fisher in terms of the gap but it was
similar to or i think even a little bit

6256
01:51:50,790 --> 01:51:50,800
similar to or i think even a little bit
 

6257
01:51:50,800 --> 01:51:54,310
similar to or i think even a little bit
better than than mine as for me

6258
01:51:54,310 --> 01:51:54,320
better than than mine as for me
 

6259
01:51:54,320 --> 01:51:56,390
better than than mine as for me
i'm of course

6260
01:51:56,390 --> 01:51:56,400
i'm of course
 

6261
01:51:56,400 --> 01:51:59,510
i'm of course
unbeaten as a world champion in in five

unbeaten as a world champion in in five
tries i've been

6264
01:52:00,950 --> 01:52:00,960
tries i've been
 

6265
01:52:00,960 --> 01:52:04,310
tries i've been
world number one for 11 years straight

6266
01:52:04,310 --> 01:52:04,320
world number one for 11 years straight
 

6267
01:52:04,320 --> 01:52:07,189
world number one for 11 years straight
in an even more competitive era than

6268
01:52:07,189 --> 01:52:07,199
in an even more competitive era than
 

6269
01:52:07,199 --> 01:52:09,270
in an even more competitive era than
gary i have the highest chest rating of

gary i have the highest chest rating of

losing a game
 

6277
01:52:15,119 --> 01:52:17,430
losing a game
i think for me the main argument would

6278
01:52:17,430 --> 01:52:17,440
i think for me the main argument would
 

6279
01:52:17,440 --> 01:52:20,790
i think for me the main argument would
be about the era where there's

6280
01:52:20,790 --> 01:52:20,800
be about the era where there's
 

6281
01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:21,750
be about the era where there's
the

harder to dominate and still

harder to dominate and still
 

6291
01:52:29,679 --> 01:52:32,229

to a weaker player
 

6537
01:56:56,159 --> 01:56:58,550
to a weaker player
whom i shouldn't have drawn to and then

6538
01:56:58,550 --> 01:56:58,560
whom i shouldn't have drawn to and then
 

6539
01:56:58,560 --> 01:57:01,669
whom i shouldn't have drawn to and then
i drew against the other guy

6540
01:57:01,669 --> 01:57:01,679
i drew against the other guy
 

6541
01:57:01,679 --> 01:57:04,310
i drew against the other guy
who was clearly like the best or second

6542
01:57:04,310 --> 01:57:04,320

best
 

6545
01:57:05,360 --> 01:57:07,430
best
and and at that point i thought it was

6546
01:57:07,430 --> 01:57:07,440
and and at that point i thought it was
 

6547
01:57:07,440 --> 01:57:08,229
and and at that point i thought it was
over

6548
01:57:08,229 --> 01:57:08,239
over
 

6549
01:57:08,239 --> 01:57:09,990

like
i think

i think
 

6653
01:59:07,760 --> 01:59:09,990
i think
before i was

browser for any other reason than to
 

6661
01:59:17,520 --> 01:59:19,669
browser for any other reason than to
play chess

6662
01:59:19,669 --> 01:59:19,679
play chess
 

6663
01:59:19,679 --> 01:59:21,830
play chess
would you describe that as love or as

6664
01:59:21,830 --> 01:59:21,840
would you describe that as love or as
 

6665
01:59:21,840 --> 01:59:24,390
would you describe that as love or as
obsession or something in between

6666
01:59:24,390 --> 01:59:24,400
obsession or something in between
 

6667
01:59:24,400 --> 01:59:28,149
obsession or something in between
it's everything yeah everything

6668
01:59:28,149 --> 01:59:28,159
it's everything yeah everything
 

6669
01:59:28,159 --> 01:59:29,109
it's everything yeah everything
but

6670
01:59:29,109 --> 01:59:29,119
but
 

6671
01:59:29,119 --> 01:59:31,510
but
so i mean it wasn't hard for me to tell

6672
01:59:31,510 --> 01:59:31,520
so i mean it wasn't hard for me to tell
 

6673
01:59:31,520 --> 01:59:33,910
so i mean it wasn't hard for me to tell
at that point that i had something that

6674
01:59:33,910 --> 01:59:33,920
at that point that i had something that
 

6675
01:59:33,920 --> 01:59:35,990
at that point that i had something that
the other other kids

6676
01:59:35,990 --> 01:59:36,000
the other other kids
 

6677
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,550
the other other kids
didn't because i was never the the one

6678
01:59:38,550 --> 01:59:38,560
didn't because i was never the the one
 

6679
01:59:38,560 --> 01:59:39,669
didn't because i was never the the one
to grasp

6680
01:59:39,669 --> 01:59:39,679
to grasp
 

6681
01:59:39,679 --> 01:59:40,950
to grasp
something

6682
01:59:40,950 --> 01:59:40,960
something
 

6683
01:59:40,960 --> 01:59:43,270
something
very very quickly but once i started i

6684
01:59:43,270 --> 01:59:43,280
very very quickly but once i started i
 

6685
01:59:43,280 --> 01:59:44,629
very very quickly but once i started i
always got hooked and then i never

6686
01:59:44,629 --> 01:59:44,639
always got hooked and then i never
 

6687
01:59:44,639 --> 01:59:46,149
always got hooked and then i never
stopped learning

6688
01:59:46,149 --> 01:59:46,159
stopped learning
 

6689
01:59:46,159 --> 01:59:47,750
stopped learning
what would you say you've talked about

6690
01:59:47,750 --> 01:59:47,760
what would you say you've talked about
 

6691
01:59:47,760 --> 01:59:49,189
what would you say you've talked about
the middle game

6692
01:59:49,189 --> 01:59:49,199
the middle game
 

6693
01:59:49,199 --> 01:59:51,430
the middle game
as a as a place where you can play pure

6694
01:59:51,430 --> 01:59:51,440
as a as a place where you can play pure
 

6695
01:59:51,440 --> 01:59:52,550
as a as a place where you can play pure
chess

6696
01:59:52,550 --> 01:59:52,560
chess
 

6697
01:59:52,560 --> 01:59:53,990
chess
what do you think is beautiful to you

6698
01:59:53,990 --> 01:59:54,000
what do you think is beautiful to you
 

6699
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,149
what do you think is beautiful to you
about chess

6700
01:59:56,149 --> 01:59:56,159
about chess
 

6701
01:59:56,159 --> 01:59:58,550
about chess
like the thing when you were 11.

6702
01:59:58,550 --> 01:59:58,560
like the thing when you were 11.
 

6703
01:59:58,560 --> 02:00:00,310
like the thing when you were 11.
what is beautiful to me

6704
02:00:00,310 --> 02:00:00,320
what is beautiful to me
 

6705
02:00:00,320 --> 02:00:03,030
what is beautiful to me
is when your opponent can predict every

6706
02:00:03,030 --> 02:00:03,040
is when your opponent can predict every
 

6707
02:00:03,040 --> 02:00:04,709
is when your opponent can predict every
single one of your moves and they still

6708
02:00:04,709 --> 02:00:04,719
single one of your moves and they still
 

6709
02:00:04,719 --> 02:00:06,070
single one of your moves and they still
lose

6710
02:00:06,070 --> 02:00:06,080
lose
 

6711
02:00:06,080 --> 02:00:08,149
lose
how does that happen no like it means

6712
02:00:08,149 --> 02:00:08,159
how does that happen no like it means
 

6713
02:00:08,159 --> 02:00:09,910
how does that happen no like it means
that at some point

6714
02:00:09,910 --> 02:00:09,920
that at some point
 

6715
02:00:09,920 --> 02:00:12,709
that at some point
early you're planning your evaluation

6716
02:00:12,709 --> 02:00:12,719
early you're planning your evaluation
 

6717
02:00:12,719 --> 02:00:14,070
early you're planning your evaluation
has been better

6718
02:00:14,070 --> 02:00:14,080
has been better
 

6719
02:00:14,080 --> 02:00:16,149
has been better
so that you play just very simply very

6720
02:00:16,149 --> 02:00:16,159
so that you play just very simply very
 

6721
02:00:16,159 --> 02:00:19,270
so that you play just very simply very
clearly it looks like you did nothing

6722
02:00:19,270 --> 02:00:19,280
clearly it looks like you did nothing
 

6723
02:00:19,280 --> 02:00:21,270
clearly it looks like you did nothing
special and your opponent lost without a

6724
02:00:21,270 --> 02:00:21,280
special and your opponent lost without a
 

6725
02:00:21,280 --> 02:00:22,229
special and your opponent lost without a
chance

6726
02:00:22,229 --> 02:00:22,239
chance
 

6727
02:00:22,239 --> 02:00:24,629
chance
so you're how do you think about that

6728
02:00:24,629 --> 02:00:24,639
so you're how do you think about that
 

6729
02:00:24,639 --> 02:00:26,550
so you're how do you think about that
by the way you basically narrow down

6730
02:00:26,550 --> 02:00:26,560
by the way you basically narrow down
 

6731
02:00:26,560 --> 02:00:29,030
by the way you basically narrow down
this gigantic tree of options

6732
02:00:29,030 --> 02:00:29,040
this gigantic tree of options
 

6733
02:00:29,040 --> 02:00:31,030
this gigantic tree of options
to where your opponent has less and less

6734
02:00:31,030 --> 02:00:31,040
to where your opponent has less and less
 

6735
02:00:31,040 --> 02:00:32,709
to where your opponent has less and less
and less options

6736
02:00:32,709 --> 02:00:32,719
and less options
 

6737
02:00:32,719 --> 02:00:34,470
and less options
to win to escape and then they're

6738
02:00:34,470 --> 02:00:34,480
to win to escape and then they're
 

6739
02:00:34,480 --> 02:00:37,510
to win to escape and then they're
trapped yeah that's it essentially

6740
02:00:37,510 --> 02:00:37,520
trapped yeah that's it essentially
 

6741
02:00:37,520 --> 02:00:39,350
trapped yeah that's it essentially
is there some aspect to the patterns

6742
02:00:39,350 --> 02:00:39,360
is there some aspect to the patterns
 

6743
02:00:39,360 --> 02:00:41,750
is there some aspect to the patterns
themselves to the positions

6744
02:00:41,750 --> 02:00:41,760
themselves to the positions
 

6745
02:00:41,760 --> 02:00:45,669
themselves to the positions
to the elegance of like

6746
02:00:45,669 --> 02:00:45,679

 

6747
02:00:45,679 --> 02:00:47,830

the the dynamics of the game that you

6748
02:00:47,830 --> 02:00:47,840
the the dynamics of the game that you
 

6749
02:00:47,840 --> 02:00:49,990
the the dynamics of the game that you
just find beautiful that that doesn't

6750
02:00:49,990 --> 02:00:50,000
just find beautiful that that doesn't
 

6751
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:51,030
just find beautiful that that doesn't
that

6752
02:00:51,030 --> 02:00:51,040
that
 

6753
02:00:51,040 --> 02:00:53,510
that
where you forget about the opponent

6754
02:00:53,510 --> 02:00:53,520
where you forget about the opponent
 

6755
02:00:53,520 --> 02:00:56,870
where you forget about the opponent
i general i try and create

6756
02:00:56,870 --> 02:00:56,880
i general i try and create
 

6757
02:00:56,880 --> 02:00:58,790
i general i try and create
harmony on the board like what i would

6758
02:00:58,790 --> 02:00:58,800
harmony on the board like what i would
 

6759
02:00:58,800 --> 02:01:02,709
harmony on the board like what i would
usually find harmonious is that

6760
02:01:02,709 --> 02:01:02,719
usually find harmonious is that
 

6761
02:01:02,719 --> 02:01:04,870
usually find harmonious is that
the pieces work

6762
02:01:04,870 --> 02:01:04,880
the pieces work
 

6763
02:01:04,880 --> 02:01:08,550
the pieces work
together that they protect each other

6764
02:01:08,550 --> 02:01:08,560
together that they protect each other
 

6765
02:01:08,560 --> 02:01:11,109
together that they protect each other
and that there are no pieces that are

6766
02:01:11,109 --> 02:01:11,119
and that there are no pieces that are
 

6767
02:01:11,119 --> 02:01:13,510
and that there are no pieces that are
suboptimally placed

6768
02:01:13,510 --> 02:01:13,520
suboptimally placed
 

6769
02:01:13,520 --> 02:01:14,709
suboptimally placed
or

6770
02:01:14,709 --> 02:01:14,719
or
 

6771
02:01:14,719 --> 02:01:16,870
or
if they are suboptimally placed

6772
02:01:16,870 --> 02:01:16,880
if they are suboptimally placed
 

6773
02:01:16,880 --> 02:01:19,189
if they are suboptimally placed
they can be improved pretty easily like

6774
02:01:19,189 --> 02:01:19,199
they can be improved pretty easily like
 

6775
02:01:19,199 --> 02:01:20,870
they can be improved pretty easily like
i hate when

6776
02:01:20,870 --> 02:01:20,880
i hate when
 

6777
02:01:20,880 --> 02:01:23,669
i hate when
i have one piece that i know is badly

6778
02:01:23,669 --> 02:01:23,679
i have one piece that i know is badly
 

6779
02:01:23,679 --> 02:01:25,830
i have one piece that i know is badly
placed and i cannot improve it

6780
02:01:25,830 --> 02:01:25,840
placed and i cannot improve it
 

6781
02:01:25,840 --> 02:01:28,149
placed and i cannot improve it
when yeah when you're thinking about the

6782
02:01:28,149 --> 02:01:28,159
when yeah when you're thinking about the
 

6783
02:01:28,159 --> 02:01:29,510
when yeah when you're thinking about the
the harmony of the pieces when you're

6784
02:01:29,510 --> 02:01:29,520
the harmony of the pieces when you're
 

6785
02:01:29,520 --> 02:01:30,790
the harmony of the pieces when you're
looking at the position you're

6786
02:01:30,790 --> 02:01:30,800
looking at the position you're
 

6787
02:01:30,800 --> 02:01:33,030
looking at the position you're
evaluating it

6788
02:01:33,030 --> 02:01:33,040
evaluating it
 

6789
02:01:33,040 --> 02:01:36,629
evaluating it
are you looking at at the whole board

6790
02:01:36,629 --> 02:01:36,639
are you looking at at the whole board
 

6791
02:01:36,639 --> 02:01:39,669
are you looking at at the whole board
or is it like a bunch of groupings of

6792
02:01:39,669 --> 02:01:39,679
or is it like a bunch of groupings of
 

6793
02:01:39,679 --> 02:01:42,470
or is it like a bunch of groupings of
pieces overlapping

6794
02:01:42,470 --> 02:01:42,480
pieces overlapping
 

6795
02:01:42,480 --> 02:01:44,310
pieces overlapping
and like dancing together kind of thing

6796
02:01:44,310 --> 02:01:44,320
and like dancing together kind of thing
 

6797
02:01:44,320 --> 02:01:47,189
and like dancing together kind of thing
i would say it's more of the lighter

6798
02:01:47,189 --> 02:01:47,199
i would say it's more of the lighter
 

6799
02:01:47,199 --> 02:01:48,550
i would say it's more of the lighter
that would be more

6800
02:01:48,550 --> 02:01:48,560
that would be more
 

6801
02:01:48,560 --> 02:01:50,470
that would be more
uh precise that you look

6802
02:01:50,470 --> 02:01:50,480
uh precise that you look
 

6803
02:01:50,480 --> 02:01:51,990
uh precise that you look
i mean

6804
02:01:51,990 --> 02:01:52,000
i mean
 

6805
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:55,030
i mean
i look mostly closer to the middle but

6806
02:01:55,030 --> 02:01:55,040
i look mostly closer to the middle but
 

6807
02:01:55,040 --> 02:01:58,310
i look mostly closer to the middle but
then i would focus on one like there are

6808
02:01:58,310 --> 02:01:58,320
then i would focus on one like there are
 

6809
02:01:58,320 --> 02:02:00,070
then i would focus on one like there are
usually like one grouping of pieces on

6810
02:02:00,070 --> 02:02:00,080
usually like one grouping of pieces on
 

6811
02:02:00,080 --> 02:02:03,030
usually like one grouping of pieces on
one side and then some more closer to

6812
02:02:03,030 --> 02:02:03,040
one side and then some more closer to
 

6813
02:02:03,040 --> 02:02:03,669
one side and then some more closer to
the

6814
02:02:03,669 --> 02:02:03,679
the
 

6815
02:02:03,679 --> 02:02:05,830
the
the other side so i would

6816
02:02:05,830 --> 02:02:05,840
the other side so i would
 

6817
02:02:05,840 --> 02:02:07,669
the other side so i would
um i would think of it a little bit that

6818
02:02:07,669 --> 02:02:07,679
um i would think of it a little bit that
 

6819
02:02:07,679 --> 02:02:09,430
um i would think of it a little bit that
way so and everything is kind of

6820
02:02:09,430 --> 02:02:09,440
way so and everything is kind of
 

6821
02:02:09,440 --> 02:02:11,830
way so and everything is kind of
gravitating to the middle

6822
02:02:11,830 --> 02:02:11,840
gravitating to the middle
 

6823
02:02:11,840 --> 02:02:13,830
gravitating to the middle
if it's going well then yes

6824
02:02:13,830 --> 02:02:13,840
if it's going well then yes
 

6825
02:02:13,840 --> 02:02:18,310
if it's going well then yes
and in harmony yeah in in harmony or

6826
02:02:18,310 --> 02:02:18,320
and in harmony yeah in in harmony or
 

6827
02:02:18,320 --> 02:02:20,229
and in harmony yeah in in harmony or
like if you can control the middle you

6828
02:02:20,229 --> 02:02:20,239
like if you can control the middle you
 

6829
02:02:20,239 --> 02:02:22,950
like if you can control the middle you
can more easily attack on both sides

6830
02:02:22,950 --> 02:02:22,960
can more easily attack on both sides
 

6831
02:02:22,960 --> 02:02:24,790
can more easily attack on both sides
that applies to

6832
02:02:24,790 --> 02:02:24,800
that applies to
 

6833
02:02:24,800 --> 02:02:26,550
that applies to
pretty much any game

6834
02:02:26,550 --> 02:02:26,560
pretty much any game
 

6835
02:02:26,560 --> 02:02:29,109
pretty much any game
it's as simple as that and like

6836
02:02:29,109 --> 02:02:29,119
it's as simple as that and like
 

6837
02:02:29,119 --> 02:02:31,669
it's as simple as that and like
attacking on one side without control of

6838
02:02:31,669 --> 02:02:31,679
attacking on one side without control of
 

6839
02:02:31,679 --> 02:02:32,709
attacking on one side without control of
the middle

6840
02:02:32,709 --> 02:02:32,719
the middle
 

6841
02:02:32,719 --> 02:02:33,510
the middle
would

6842
02:02:33,510 --> 02:02:33,520
would
 

6843
02:02:33,520 --> 02:02:34,950
would
feel

6844
02:02:34,950 --> 02:02:34,960
feel
 

6845
02:02:34,960 --> 02:02:38,149
feel
very non-harmonious for for me like i i

6846
02:02:38,149 --> 02:02:38,159
very non-harmonious for for me like i i
 

6847
02:02:38,159 --> 02:02:40,470
very non-harmonious for for me like i i
talked about the 10th game

6848
02:02:40,470 --> 02:02:40,480
talked about the 10th game
 

6849
02:02:40,480 --> 02:02:42,470
talked about the 10th game
and

6850
02:02:42,470 --> 02:02:42,480
and
 

6851

and
in the world championship like that's

02:02:44,149 --> 02:02:44,159
in the world championship like that's
 

6853
02:02:44,159 --> 02:02:46,229
in the world championship like that's
the time i was the most nervous and it

6854
02:02:46,229 --> 02:02:46,239
the time i was the most nervous and it
 

6855
02:02:46,239 --> 02:02:48,070
the time i was the most nervous and it
was

6856
02:02:48,070 --> 02:02:48,080
was
 

6857
02:02:48,080 --> 02:02:49,510
was
because it was a kind of attack that i

6858
02:02:49,510 --> 02:02:49,520
because it was a kind of attack that i
 

6859
02:02:49,520 --> 02:02:51,830
because it was a kind of attack that i
hate where you just have to

6860
02:02:51,830 --> 02:02:51,840
hate where you just have to
 

6861
02:02:51,840 --> 02:02:54,709
hate where you just have to
you're abandoned one side and you

6862
02:02:54,709 --> 02:02:54,719
you're abandoned one side and you
 

6863
02:02:54,719 --> 02:02:57,430
you're abandoned one side and you
the attack has to work

6864
02:02:57,430 --> 02:02:57,440
the attack has to work
 

6865
02:02:57,440 --> 02:02:59,430
the attack has to work
there was one side and part of the

6866
02:02:59,430 --> 02:02:59,440
there was one side and part of the
 

6867
02:02:59,440 --> 02:03:01,270
there was one side and part of the
middle as well which i didn't control at

6868
02:03:01,270 --> 02:03:01,280
middle as well which i didn't control at
 

6869
02:03:01,280 --> 02:03:03,830
middle as well which i didn't control at
all and that that's

6870
02:03:03,830 --> 02:03:03,840
all and that that's
 

6871
02:03:03,840 --> 02:03:06,390
all and that that's
like the opposite of harmony for me

6872
02:03:06,390 --> 02:03:06,400
like the opposite of harmony for me
 

6873
02:03:06,400 --> 02:03:09,750
like the opposite of harmony for me

the better yeah at least for you
 

6905
02:03:40,639 --> 02:03:43,910
the better yeah at least for you
that's for sure but i'm also very very

6906
02:03:43,910 --> 02:03:43,920
that's for sure but i'm also very very
 

6907
02:03:43,920 --> 02:03:46,950
that's for sure but i'm also very very
skeptical about giving advice because i

6908
02:03:46,950 --> 02:03:46,960
skeptical about giving advice because i
 

6909
02:03:46,960 --> 02:03:48,709
skeptical about giving advice because i
think

6910
02:03:48,709 --> 02:03:48,719
think
 

6911
02:03:48,719 --> 02:03:52,069
think
again my way only works if you

6912
02:03:52,069 --> 02:03:52,079
again my way only works if you
 

6913
02:03:52,079 --> 02:03:53,669
again my way only works if you
have some

6914
02:03:53,669 --> 02:03:53,679
have some
 

6915
02:03:53,679 --> 02:03:56,310
have some
combination of talented and obsession so

6916
02:03:56,310 --> 02:03:56,320
combination of talented and obsession so
 

6917
02:03:56,320 --> 02:03:58,950
combination of talented and obsession so
i'm not sure that i'd generally

6918
02:03:58,950 --> 02:03:58,960
i'm not sure that i'd generally
 

6919
02:03:58,960 --> 02:04:01,030
i'm not sure that i'd generally
recommend it like what i've done

6920
02:04:01,030 --> 02:04:01,040
recommend it like what i've done
 

6921
02:04:01,040 --> 02:04:02,790
recommend it like what i've done
doesn't go with

02:04:02,790 --> 02:04:02,800
doesn't go with
 

6923
02:04:02,800 --> 02:04:06,390
doesn't go with
what most coaches suggest for their kids

from from early on that have been very
 

6929
02:04:10,400 --> 02:04:13,109
from from early on that have been very
very hands-off and just allowed me to do

6930
02:04:13,109 --> 02:04:13,119
very hands-off and just allowed me to do

for a long time we were kind of going
back and forth fighting about that um

7352
02:11:54,550 --> 02:11:54,560
back and forth fighting about that um
 

7353
02:11:54,560 --> 02:11:56,390
back and forth fighting about that um
especially my father but also my mother

7354
02:11:56,390 --> 02:11:56,400
especially my father but also my mother
 

7355
02:11:56,400 --> 02:11:57,589
especially my father but also my mother
a little bit

7356
02:11:57,589 --> 02:11:57,599
a little bit
 

7357
02:11:57,599 --> 02:11:59,750
a little bit
it was at times a little bit difficult

7358
02:11:59,750 --> 02:11:59,760
it was at times a little bit difficult
 

7359
02:11:59,760 --> 02:12:01,430
it was at times a little bit difficult
they wanted you to go to school yeah

7360
02:12:01,430 --> 02:12:01,440

7362
02:12:03,350 --> 02:12:03,360

02:12:05,589 --> 02:12:05,599
do more school to have more options and
 

7365
02:12:05,599 --> 02:12:06,390
do more school to have more options and
then

7366
02:12:06,390 --> 02:12:06,400
then
 

7367
02:12:06,400 --> 02:12:11,030
then
i i think at some point

7368
02:12:11,030 --> 02:12:11,040

 

7369
02:12:11,040 --> 02:12:13,430

7371
02:12:13,440 --> 02:12:15,589
they just gave up
but i think that sort of coincided when

02:12:15,589 --> 02:12:15,599
but i think that sort of coincided when
 

7373
02:12:15,599 --> 02:12:17,030
but i think that sort of coincided when

02:12:19,840 --> 02:12:22,390
money off tournaments and after that you
know everything's been

7378
02:12:22,390 --> 02:12:22,400

7379
02:12:22,400 --> 02:12:24,470

but let's try to actually get
to some deep truth perhaps

02:14:03,669 --> 02:14:03,679
to some deep truth perhaps
 

7467
02:14:03,679 --> 02:14:05,830

that obviously for every action there's
 

7541
02:15:24,639 --> 02:15:28,550
that obviously for every action there's
a reaction and you have to to calculate

a reaction and you have to to calculate
 

7543
02:15:28,560 --> 02:15:31,189
a reaction and you have to to calculate
far ahead it probably would be a good

are wrong for different reasons and they
 

7571
02:15:58,480 --> 02:16:00,310
are wrong for different reasons and they
should know if they did some calculation

7572
02:16:00,310 --> 02:16:00,320
should know if they did some calculation
 

7573
02:16:00,320 --> 02:16:01,830

7748
02:19:00,469 --> 02:19:00,479
not playing dynamic enough and then i
 

7749
02:19:00,479 --> 02:19:02,629
not playing dynamic enough and then i
started to get a little bit better at

started to get a little bit better at
 

7751
02:19:02,639 --> 02:19:05,110
started to get a little bit better at
dynamics so that now i'm

7752
02:19:05,110 --> 02:19:05,120
dynamics so that now i'm
 

7753
02:19:05,120 --> 02:19:06,389
dynamics so that now i'm
i would say definitely the most

7754
02:19:06,389 --> 02:19:06,399
i would say definitely the most
 

7755
02:19:06,399 --> 02:19:09,110
i would say definitely the most

expect
from the best chess player in the world

7912
02:21:44,550 --> 02:21:44,560

02:21:48,630 --> 02:21:48,640
anything that's non-robotic is
 

7917
02:21:48,640 --> 02:21:50,469
anything that's non-robotic is
interesting

7918
02:21:50,469 --> 02:21:50,479

there will be trash talking and over the
 

7957
02:22:28,960 --> 02:22:30,230
there will be trash talking and over the
chessboard and some of the big

7958
02:22:30,230 --> 02:22:30,240
chessboard and some of the big
 

7959
02:22:30,240 --> 02:22:31,429
chessboard and some of the big
tournaments

7960
02:22:31,429 --> 02:22:31,439
tournaments
 

7961
02:22:31,439 --> 02:22:33,830
tournaments
like adding that kind of component or

7962
02:22:33,830 --> 02:22:33,840
like adding that kind of component or
 

7963
02:22:33,840 --> 02:22:35,510
like adding that kind of component or
even talking you know

7964

all the time it's a normal part of the

7976
02:22:48,790 --> 02:22:48,800
all the time it's a normal part of the
 

7977
02:22:48,800 --> 02:22:51,030
all the time it's a normal part of the
game

7978
02:22:51,030 --> 02:22:51,040
game
 

7979
02:22:51,040 --> 02:22:54,150
game
so you uh you emphasize fun a lot

7980
02:22:54,150 --> 02:22:54,160
so you uh you emphasize fun a lot
 

7981

so you uh you emphasize fun a lot
uh do you think we're living inside of a

7982
02:22:57,349 --> 02:22:57,359
uh do you think we're living inside of a
 

7983
02:22:57,359 --> 02:22:58,790
uh do you think we're living inside of a
simulation

7984
02:22:58,790 --> 02:22:58,800
simulation
 

7985
02:22:58,800 --> 02:23:03,830
simulation
that is trying to maximize fun

7986
02:23:03,830 --> 02:23:03,840

 

7987
02:23:03,840 --> 02:23:07,429

but that's only happened for the last

7988
02:23:07,429 --> 02:23:07,439
but that's only happened for the last
 

7989
02:23:07,439 --> 02:23:09,750
but that's only happened for the last
you know 100 years or so no that's

7990
02:23:09,750 --> 02:23:09,760
you know 100 years or so no that's
 

7991
02:23:09,760 --> 02:23:12,070
you know 100 years or so no that's
like the fun has always been increasing

7992
02:23:12,070 --> 02:23:12,080
like the fun has always been increasing
 

7993
02:23:12,080 --> 02:23:13,750
like the fun has always been increasing
i think yeah okay it's always been

7994
02:23:13,750 --> 02:23:13,760
i think yeah okay it's always been
 

7995
02:23:13,760 --> 02:23:15,030
i think yeah okay it's always been
increasing but i feel like it's been

7996
02:23:15,030 --> 02:23:15,040
increasing but i feel like it's been
 

7997
02:23:15,040 --> 02:23:16,830
increasing but i feel like it's been
increasing

7998
02:23:16,830 --> 02:23:16,840
increasing
 

7999
02:23:16,840 --> 02:23:19,030
increasing
exponentially yeah

8000
02:23:19,030 --> 02:23:19,040
exponentially yeah
 

8001
02:23:19,040 --> 02:23:21,429
exponentially yeah
i mean the or at least the importance of

8002
02:23:21,429 --> 02:23:21,439
i mean the or at least the importance of
 

8003
02:23:21,439 --> 02:23:22,309
i mean the or at least the importance of
fun

8004
02:23:22,309 --> 02:23:22,319
fun
 

8005
02:23:22,319 --> 02:23:24,630
fun
but i guess it depends on the society as

8006
02:23:24,630 --> 02:23:24,640
but i guess it depends on the society as
 

8007
02:23:24,640 --> 02:23:27,030
but i guess it depends on the society as
well like in the west we've had such

8008
02:23:27,030 --> 02:23:27,040
well like in the west we've had such
 

8009
02:23:27,040 --> 02:23:28,950
well like in the west we've had such
uh christian

8010
02:23:28,950 --> 02:23:28,960
uh christian
 

8011
02:23:28,960 --> 02:23:30,469
uh christian
influence and

8012
02:23:30,469 --> 02:23:30,479
influence and
 

8013
02:23:30,479 --> 02:23:32,630
influence and
i mean christianity hasn't

8014
02:23:32,630 --> 02:23:32,640
i mean christianity hasn't
 

8015
02:23:32,640 --> 02:23:35,910
i mean christianity hasn't
exactly embraced the concept of fun over

8016
02:23:35,910 --> 02:23:35,920
exactly embraced the concept of fun over
 

8017
02:23:35,920 --> 02:23:38,230
exactly embraced the concept of fun over
over time so well actually to push back

8018
02:23:38,230 --> 02:23:38,240
over time so well actually to push back
 

8019
02:23:38,240 --> 02:23:40,630
over time so well actually to push back
i think forbidding certain things kind

8020
02:23:40,630 --> 02:23:40,640
i think forbidding certain things kind
 

8021
02:23:40,640 --> 02:23:42,150
i think forbidding certain things kind
of makes them more fun

8022
02:23:42,150 --> 02:23:42,160
of makes them more fun
 

8023
02:23:42,160 --> 02:23:44,389
of makes them more fun
so sometimes i think you need to

8024
02:23:44,389 --> 02:23:44,399
so sometimes i think you need to
 

8025
02:23:44,399 --> 02:23:46,389
so sometimes i think you need to
say you're not allowed to do this

8026
02:23:46,389 --> 02:23:46,399
say you're not allowed to do this
 

8027
02:23:46,399 --> 02:23:48,150
say you're not allowed to do this
and then a lot of people start doing it

8028
02:23:48,150 --> 02:23:48,160
and then a lot of people start doing it
 

8029
02:23:48,160 --> 02:23:49,510
and then a lot of people start doing it
and then they have fun doing that

8030
02:23:49,510 --> 02:23:49,520
and then they have fun doing that
 

8031
02:23:49,520 --> 02:23:51,270
and then they have fun doing that
because it's like uh

8032
02:23:51,270 --> 02:23:51,280
because it's like uh
 

8033
02:23:51,280 --> 02:23:52,389
because it's like uh
um

8034
02:23:52,389 --> 02:23:52,399
um
 

8035
02:23:52,399 --> 02:23:54,070
um
it's doing a thing in the face of the

8036
02:23:54,070 --> 02:23:54,080
it's doing a thing in the face of the
 

8037
02:23:54,080 --> 02:23:55,990
it's doing a thing in the face of the
resistance of the thing so whenever

8038
02:23:55,990 --> 02:23:56,000
resistance of the thing so whenever
 

8039

resistance of the thing so whenever
there's resistance that does somehow

8040
02:23:57,590 --> 02:23:57,600
there's resistance that does somehow
 

8041
02:23:57,600 --> 02:23:59,030
there's resistance that does somehow
make it more fun

02:24:26,710 --> 02:24:26,720
populists plus vodka on top of that but
 

8071
02:24:26,720 --> 02:24:28,230
populists plus vodka on top of that but
this idea that

8072
02:24:28,230 --> 02:24:28,240
this idea that
 

8073
02:24:28,240 --> 02:24:30,630
this idea that
for example elon musk has that

8074
02:24:30,630 --> 02:24:30,640
for example elon musk has that
 

8075
02:24:30,640 --> 02:24:31,830
for example elon musk has that
um

8076
02:24:31,830 --> 02:24:31,840
um
 

8077
02:24:31,840 --> 02:24:33,830
um
the most entertaining outcome was the

8078
02:24:33,830 --> 02:24:33,840
the most entertaining outcome was the
 

8079
02:24:33,840 --> 02:24:36,070
the most entertaining outcome was the
most likely

8080
02:24:36,070 --> 02:24:36,080
most likely
 

8081
02:24:36,080 --> 02:24:39,030
most likely
that it seems like the most absurd silly

8082
02:24:39,030 --> 02:24:39,040
that it seems like the most absurd silly
 

8083
02:24:39,040 --> 02:24:41,990
that it seems like the most absurd silly
funny thing seems to be the thing so it

8084
02:24:41,990 --> 02:24:42,000
funny thing seems to be the thing so it
 

8085
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,230
funny thing seems to be the thing so it
happens more often than um than it

8086
02:24:44,230 --> 02:24:44,240
happens more often than um than it
 

8087
02:24:44,240 --> 02:24:45,670
happens more often than um than it
should and it's something that goes

8088
02:24:45,670 --> 02:24:45,680
should and it's something that goes
 

8089
02:24:45,680 --> 02:24:49,030
should and it's something that goes
viral in our modern connected world

8090
02:24:49,030 --> 02:24:49,040
viral in our modern connected world
 

8091
02:24:49,040 --> 02:24:52,230
viral in our modern connected world
and so the fun stuff the memes

8092
02:24:52,230 --> 02:24:52,240
and so the fun stuff the memes
 

8093
02:24:52,240 --> 02:24:54,630
and so the fun stuff the memes
spread and then we start to optimize for

8094
02:24:54,630 --> 02:24:54,640
spread and then we start to optimize for
 

8095
02:24:54,640 --> 02:24:56,550
spread and then we start to optimize for
the for the fun meme

8096
02:24:56,550 --> 02:24:56,560
the for the fun meme
 

8097
02:24:56,560 --> 02:24:58,389
the for the fun meme
that seems to be a fundamental property

8098
02:24:58,389 --> 02:24:58,399
that seems to be a fundamental property
 

8099
02:24:58,399 --> 02:25:01,510
that seems to be a fundamental property
of of the reality we live in

8100
02:25:01,510 --> 02:25:01,520
of of the reality we live in
 

8101
02:25:01,520 --> 02:25:04,630
of of the reality we live in
and so emerges the met the fun maximizer

8102
02:25:04,630 --> 02:25:04,640
and so emerges the met the fun maximizer
 

8103
02:25:04,640 --> 02:25:06,309
and so emerges the met the fun maximizer
in all walks of life
