00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,810
cleaner maybe a little healthier but in
time robots are going to be the

declines in our ability to live

168
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:26,800
declines in our ability to live
 

169
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,430
declines in our ability to live
independently and maintain our standard

00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:29,440
independently and maintain our standard
 

171
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,450
independently and maintain our standard
of living and a future that is the

172
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:33,460
of living and a future that is the
 

173
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:36,960
of living and a future that is the
bright one where we have more control of

174
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:36,970
bright one where we have more control of
 

175
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:39,620
bright one where we have more control of
our lives can spend more of our time

176
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:39,630
our lives can spend more of our time

00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:47,250
our lives can spend more of our time
focused on activities we choose and so

178
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:47,260
focused on activities we choose and so
 

179
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,260
focused on activities we choose and so
honored and excited to be playing a role

180
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:49,270
honored and excited to be playing a role
 

181
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:51,900
honored and excited to be playing a role
in that journey so you give me a tour it

182
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:51,910
in that journey so you give me a tour it
 

183
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:54,180
in that journey so you give me a tour it
showed me some of the long histories now

184
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:54,190
showed me some of the long histories now
 

185
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:57,180
showed me some of the long histories now
29 years that I iRobot has been at it

186
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:57,190
29 years that I iRobot has been at it
 

187
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:59,400
29 years that I iRobot has been at it
creating some incredible robots who

188
00:04:59,400 --> 00:04:59,410
creating some incredible robots who
 

189
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:01,860
creating some incredible robots who
showed me Pat bot he showed me a bunch

190
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:01,870
showed me Pat bot he showed me a bunch
 

191
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:04,469
showed me Pat bot he showed me a bunch
of other stuff that led up to Roomba

192
00:05:04,469 --> 00:05:04,479
of other stuff that led up to Roomba
 

193
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:12,000
of other stuff that led up to Roomba
that led to Brava and Terra so let's

194
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,010
that led to Brava and Terra so let's
 

195
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:14,250
that led to Brava and Terra so let's
skip that incredible history in the

196
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:14,260
skip that incredible history in the
 

197
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,420
skip that incredible history in the
interest of time because we already

198
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:15,430
interest of time because we already
 

199
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,529
interest of time because we already
talked about it I'll show this

200
00:05:16,529 --> 00:05:16,539
talked about it I'll show this
 

201
00:05:16,539 --> 00:05:17,400
talked about it I'll show this
incredible footage

202
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:17,410
incredible footage
 

203
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:21,719
incredible footage
you mentioned elderly and robotics and

204
00:05:21,719 --> 00:05:21,729
you mentioned elderly and robotics and
 

205
00:05:21,729 --> 00:05:23,909
you mentioned elderly and robotics and
society I think the home is a

206
00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:23,919
society I think the home is a
 

207
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:26,400
society I think the home is a
fascinating place for robots to be so

208
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:26,410
fascinating place for robots to be so
 

209
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:29,190
fascinating place for robots to be so
where do you see robots in the home

210
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:29,200
where do you see robots in the home
 

211
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,409
where do you see robots in the home
currently I would say once again

212
00:05:31,409 --> 00:05:31,419
currently I would say once again
 

213
00:05:31,419 --> 00:05:33,120
currently I would say once again
probably most homes in the world don't

214
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,130
probably most homes in the world don't
 

215
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:35,610
probably most homes in the world don't
have a robot so how do you see that

216
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:35,620
have a robot so how do you see that
 

217
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:38,279
have a robot so how do you see that
changing woody things the big initial

00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:42,520
value add that robots can do so iRobot
 

221
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,659
value add that robots can do so iRobot
has sort of over the years narrowed in

deliver tools that
we'll help a home be a more

230
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:01,540
we'll help a home be a more
 

231
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:04,270
we'll help a home be a more
automatically maintained place a

00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:04,280
automatically maintained place a
 

233
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,940
automatically maintained place a
healthier place a safer place and

healthier place a safer place and
 

235
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:10,720
healthier place a safer place and
perhaps even a more efficient place to

00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:10,730
perhaps even a more efficient place to
 

237
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:14,800
perhaps even a more efficient place to
be and you know today we vacuum we mop

soon we'll be mowing your lawn but where

240
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:19,340
soon we'll be mowing your lawn but where
 

241
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:23,230
soon we'll be mowing your lawn but where
things are going is when do we get to

242
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:23,240
things are going is when do we get to
 

243
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,550
things are going is when do we get to
the point where the home not just the

244
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:27,560
the point where the home not just the
 

245
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,350
the point where the home not just the
robots that live in your home but the

246
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:29,360
robots that live in your home but the
 

247
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,570
robots that live in your home but the
home itself becomes part of a system

248
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:31,580
home itself becomes part of a system
 

249
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:34,570
home itself becomes part of a system
that maintains itself and plays an

250
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:34,580
that maintains itself and plays an
 

251
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:38,980
that maintains itself and plays an
active role in caring for and helping

252
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:38,990
active role in caring for and helping
 

253
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:40,960
active role in caring for and helping
the people who live in that home and I

254
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:40,970
the people who live in that home and I
 

255
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:43,750
the people who live in that home and I
see everything that we're doing as steps

256
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:43,760
see everything that we're doing as steps
 

257
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,270
see everything that we're doing as steps
along the path toward that future so

258
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:46,280
along the path toward that future so
 

259
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,640
along the path toward that future so
what are the what are the steps so if we

260
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:48,650
what are the what are the steps so if we
 

261
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:51,040
what are the what are the steps so if we
can summarize some of the history of

262
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,050
can summarize some of the history of
 

263
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:54,460
can summarize some of the history of
Roomba the you've mentioned and maybe

264
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:54,470
Roomba the you've mentioned and maybe
 

265
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:55,900
Roomba the you've mentioned and maybe
you can elaborate on it but you

266
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:55,910
you can elaborate on it but you
 

267
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:57,310
you can elaborate on it but you
mentioned that the early days were

268
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:57,320
mentioned that the early days were
 

269
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:01,540
mentioned that the early days were
really taking a robot from something

270
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:01,550
really taking a robot from something
 

271
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,340
really taking a robot from something
that works either in the lab or

272
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:03,350
that works either in the lab or
 

273
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:04,960
that works either in the lab or
something that works in the field that

274
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:04,970
something that works in the field that
 

275
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:09,430
something that works in the field that
helps soldiers do the difficult work

276
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:09,440
helps soldiers do the difficult work
 

277
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,470
helps soldiers do the difficult work
they do to actually be in the hands of

278
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:11,480
they do to actually be in the hands of
 

279
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,710
they do to actually be in the hands of
consumers and tens of thousands hundreds

280
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:14,720
consumers and tens of thousands hundreds
 

281
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,060
consumers and tens of thousands hundreds
of thousands robots that don't break

282
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:16,070
of thousands robots that don't break
 

283
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:18,670
of thousands robots that don't break
down over how much people love them over

284
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:18,680
down over how much people love them over
 

285
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,820
down over how much people love them over
months of very extensive use so that was

286
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:21,830
months of very extensive use so that was
 

287
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:23,650
months of very extensive use so that was
the big first step and then the second

288
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:23,660
the big first step and then the second
 

289
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:27,040
the big first step and then the second
big step was the ability to sense the

290
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,050
big step was the ability to sense the
 

291
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:29,770
big step was the ability to sense the
environment to build a map to localize

292
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:29,780
environment to build a map to localize
 

293
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,810
environment to build a map to localize
to be able to build a picture of the

294
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:31,820
to be able to build a picture of the
 

295
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,820
to be able to build a picture of the
home that the human can then attach

296
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:33,830
home that the human can then attach
 

297
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:37,000
home that the human can then attach
labels to in terms of you know giving

298
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,010
labels to in terms of you know giving
 

299
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:39,010
labels to in terms of you know giving
some semantic knowledge to the robot

300
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:39,020
some semantic knowledge to the robot
 

301
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,680
some semantic knowledge to the robot
about its environment okay so that's

302
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:41,690
about its environment okay so that's
 

303
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:46,570
about its environment okay so that's
like a huge two big huge steps now maybe

304
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:46,580
like a huge two big huge steps now maybe
 

305
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,610
like a huge two big huge steps now maybe
you can comment on them but also what is

306
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:48,620
you can comment on them but also what is
 

307
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:53,560
you can comment on them but also what is
the the the next step of of making a

308
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:53,570
the the the next step of of making a
 

309
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:56,800
the the the next step of of making a
robot part of the home sure so the goal

310
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:56,810
robot part of the home sure so the goal
 

311
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:00,160
robot part of the home sure so the goal
is to make a home that that takes care

312
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:00,170
is to make a home that that takes care
 

313
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:01,360
is to make a home that that takes care
of itself

314
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:01,370
of itself
 

315
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:04,290
of itself
takes care of the people in the home and

316
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:04,300
takes care of the people in the home and
 

317
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,970
takes care of the people in the home and
gives a user and experience of just

318
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:06,980
gives a user and experience of just
 

319
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,560
gives a user and experience of just
living their life in the home is somehow

320
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:08,570
living their life in the home is somehow
 

321

living their life in the home is somehow
doing the right thing

322
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:11,090
doing the right thing

environment and we went from robots that
 

327
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:26,020
environment and we went from robots that
were great in the lab but we're both too

328
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:26,030
were great in the lab but we're both too
 

329
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:29,680
were great in the lab but we're both too
expensive and not sufficiently capable

00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:52,130
purchase intent now we've disrupted the
 

343
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:56,680
purchase intent now we've disrupted the
entire vacuuming industry the number one

344
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:56,690
entire vacuuming industry the number one
 

345
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:59,710
entire vacuuming industry the number one
selling vacuums for example in the u.s.

346
00:08:59,710 --> 00:08:59,720
selling vacuums for example in the u.s.
 

347
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,500
selling vacuums for example in the u.s.
our room bows so not robot vacuums but

348
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:02,510
our room bows so not robot vacuums but
 

349
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:03,760
our room bows so not robot vacuums but
vacuums and that's really crazy and

350
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:03,770
vacuums and that's really crazy and
 

351
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:06,519
vacuums and that's really crazy and
weird and yes we need to pause and

352
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:06,529
weird and yes we need to pause and
 

353
00:09:06,529 --> 00:09:09,310
weird and yes we need to pause and
that's incredible that's this is

354
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:09,320
that's incredible that's this is
 

355
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,710
that's incredible that's this is
incredible that a robot is this is the

356
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:11,720
incredible that a robot is this is the
 

357
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,110
incredible that a robot is this is the
number one selling thing that does

358
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:14,120
number one selling thing that does
 

359
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,200
number one selling thing that does
something yep everything as essential as

360
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:17,210
something yep everything as essential as
 

361
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:21,910
something yep everything as essential as
vacuuming so we're it's still kind of

362
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:21,920
vacuuming so we're it's still kind of
 

363
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,070
vacuuming so we're it's still kind of
fun to say but they just because this

364
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:24,080
fun to say but they just because this
 

365
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,140
fun to say but they just because this
was a crazy idea that that just started

366
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:28,150
was a crazy idea that that just started
 

367
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:32,350
was a crazy idea that that just started
you know in a room here we're like do

368
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:32,360
you know in a room here we're like do
 

369
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,560
you know in a room here we're like do
you think we can do this hey let's give

370
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:35,570
you think we can do this hey let's give
 

371
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:40,090
you think we can do this hey let's give
it a try but but now the robots are

372
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:40,100
it a try but but now the robots are
 

373
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,829
it a try but but now the robots are
starting to understand their environment

374
00:09:41,829 --> 00:09:41,839
starting to understand their environment
 

375
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,570
starting to understand their environment
and if you think about the next step

376
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:45,580
and if you think about the next step
 

377
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:49,600
and if you think about the next step
there's two dimensions I've been working

378
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:49,610
there's two dimensions I've been working
 

379
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:53,140
there's two dimensions I've been working
so hard since the beginning of iRobot to

380
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:53,150
so hard since the beginning of iRobot to
 

381
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:56,290
so hard since the beginning of iRobot to
make robots are autonomous that you know

382
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:56,300
make robots are autonomous that you know
 

383
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,270
make robots are autonomous that you know
they're smart enough and understand

384
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:58,280
they're smart enough and understand
 

385
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,160
they're smart enough and understand
their task enough they they can just go

386
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:00,170
their task enough they they can just go
 

387
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:04,540
their task enough they they can just go
do it without human involvement now what

388
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:04,550
do it without human involvement now what
 

389
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:07,840
do it without human involvement now what
I'm really excited and working on is how

390
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:07,850
I'm really excited and working on is how
 

391
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:10,139
I'm really excited and working on is how
do I make them less autonomous

392
00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:10,149
do I make them less autonomous
 

393
00:10:10,149 --> 00:10:14,189
do I make them less autonomous
meaning that the robot is supposed to be

394
00:10:14,189 --> 00:10:14,199
meaning that the robot is supposed to be
 

395
00:10:14,199 --> 00:10:17,220
meaning that the robot is supposed to be
your partner not this automaton that

396
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:17,230
your partner not this automaton that
 

397
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:20,340
your partner not this automaton that
just goes and does what a robot does and

398
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:20,350
just goes and does what a robot does and
 

399
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:23,759
just goes and does what a robot does and
so that if you tell it hey I just

400
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:23,769
so that if you tell it hey I just
 

401
00:10:23,769 --> 00:10:26,160
so that if you tell it hey I just
dropped some flower by the fridge in the

402
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:26,170
dropped some flower by the fridge in the
 

403
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:28,220
dropped some flower by the fridge in the
kitchen not can you deal with it

404
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:28,230
kitchen not can you deal with it
 

405
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,900
kitchen not can you deal with it
wouldn't be awesome if the right thing

406
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:30,910
wouldn't be awesome if the right thing
 

407
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,030
wouldn't be awesome if the right thing
just happened

408
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:32,040
just happened
 

409
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:36,030
just happened
based on that utterance and to some

410
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:36,040
based on that utterance and to some
 

411
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,009
based on that utterance and to some
extent that's less autonomous because

412
00:10:38,009 --> 00:10:38,019
extent that's less autonomous because
 

413
00:10:38,019 --> 00:10:40,129
extent that's less autonomous because
it's actually listening to you

414
00:10:40,129 --> 00:10:40,139
it's actually listening to you
 

415
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,660
it's actually listening to you
understanding the context and intent of

416
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:42,670
understanding the context and intent of
 

417
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:46,189
understanding the context and intent of
the sentence mapping it against its

418
00:10:46,189 --> 00:10:46,199
the sentence mapping it against its
 

419
00:10:46,199 --> 00:10:49,470
the sentence mapping it against its
understanding of the home it lives in

420

understanding of the home it lives in
 

421
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:53,970
understanding of the home it lives in
and knowing what to do and so that's an

422
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:53,980
and knowing what to do and so that's an
 

423
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:57,420
and knowing what to do and so that's an
area of research it's an area where

424
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:57,430
area of research it's an area where
 

425
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,489
area of research it's an area where
we're starting to roll out features you

426
00:10:59,489 --> 00:10:59,499
we're starting to roll out features you
 

427
00:10:59,499 --> 00:11:02,160
we're starting to roll out features you
can now tell your robot to clean up the

428
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:02,170
can now tell your robot to clean up the
 

429
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:04,259
can now tell your robot to clean up the
kitchen and it knows what the kitchen is

430
00:11:04,259 --> 00:11:04,269
kitchen and it knows what the kitchen is
 

431
00:11:04,269 --> 00:11:08,189
kitchen and it knows what the kitchen is
and can do that and that's sort of 1.0

432
00:11:08,189 --> 00:11:08,199
and can do that and that's sort of 1.0
 

433
00:11:08,199 --> 00:11:09,590
and can do that and that's sort of 1.0
of where we're going

434
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:09,600
of where we're going
 

435
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,629
of where we're going
the other cool thing is that we're

436
00:11:12,629 --> 00:11:12,639
the other cool thing is that we're
 

437
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:14,970
the other cool thing is that we're
starting to know where stuff is and why

438
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:14,980
starting to know where stuff is and why
 

439
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:18,629
starting to know where stuff is and why
is that important well robots are

440
00:11:18,629 --> 00:11:18,639
is that important well robots are
 

441
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:22,139
is that important well robots are
supposed to have arms right data had an

442
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:22,149
supposed to have arms right data had an
 

443
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:24,689
supposed to have arms right data had an
arm Rosie had an arm yeah Robbie the

444
00:11:24,689 --> 00:11:24,699
arm Rosie had an arm yeah Robbie the
 

445
00:11:24,699 --> 00:11:26,400
arm Rosie had an arm yeah Robbie the
robot Hatter I mean brother you know

446
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:26,410
robot Hatter I mean brother you know
 

447
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:28,139
robot Hatter I mean brother you know
they are physical things that move her

448
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:28,149
they are physical things that move her
 

449
00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:29,699
they are physical things that move her
around in an environment they're

450
00:11:29,699 --> 00:11:29,709
around in an environment they're
 

451
00:11:29,709 --> 00:11:32,759
around in an environment they're
supposed to like do work yeah and if you

452
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:32,769
supposed to like do work yeah and if you
 

453
00:11:32,769 --> 00:11:34,860
supposed to like do work yeah and if you
think about it if a robot doesn't know

454
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:34,870
think about it if a robot doesn't know
 

455
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:38,069
think about it if a robot doesn't know
anything where anything is why should it

456
00:11:38,069 --> 00:11:38,079
anything where anything is why should it
 

457
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:42,780
anything where anything is why should it
have an arm but with this new dawn of

458
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:42,790
have an arm but with this new dawn of
 

459
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:45,030
have an arm but with this new dawn of
home understanding that we're starting

460
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:45,040
home understanding that we're starting
 

461
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,840
home understanding that we're starting
to go enjoy I know where the kitchen is

462
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:48,850
to go enjoy I know where the kitchen is
 

463
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:51,179
to go enjoy I know where the kitchen is
I might in the future know where the

464
00:11:51,179 --> 00:11:51,189
I might in the future know where the
 

465
00:11:51,189 --> 00:11:53,939
I might in the future know where the
refrigerators I might if I had an arm be

466
00:11:53,939 --> 00:11:53,949
refrigerators I might if I had an arm be
 

467
00:11:53,949 --> 00:11:55,860
refrigerators I might if I had an arm be
able to find the hand I'll open it and

468
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:55,870
able to find the hand I'll open it and
 

469
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:59,220
able to find the hand I'll open it and
even get myself a beer obviously that's

470
00:11:59,220 --> 00:11:59,230
even get myself a beer obviously that's
 

471
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:02,040
even get myself a beer obviously that's
one of the true dreams of robotics as

472
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:02,050
one of the true dreams of robotics as
 

473
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:03,809
one of the true dreams of robotics as
Deb robots bringing us a beer while we

474
00:12:03,809 --> 00:12:03,819
Deb robots bringing us a beer while we
 

475
00:12:03,819 --> 00:12:07,230
Deb robots bringing us a beer while we
watch television but um you know I think

476
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:07,240
watch television but um you know I think
 

477
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:11,419
watch television but um you know I think

remains ambiguous so you as somebody who
dreams of robots you know changing the

638
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:44,700
dreams of robots you know changing the
 

639
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:49,190
dreams of robots you know changing the
world what's your estimate why how big

640
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:49,200
world what's your estimate why how big
 

641
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:54,020
world what's your estimate why how big
is the space of applications that fit

642
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:54,030
is the space of applications that fit
 

643
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,580
is the space of applications that fit
the criteria that you just described

644
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:55,590
the criteria that you just described
 

645
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:57,980
the criteria that you just described
where you can really demonstrate an

646
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:57,990
where you can really demonstrate an
 

647
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:00,800
where you can really demonstrate an
obvious significant value over the

648
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:00,810
obvious significant value over the
 

649
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:04,809
obvious significant value over the
alternative non robot bought a solution

650
00:17:04,809 --> 00:17:04,819
alternative non robot bought a solution
 

651
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:07,819
alternative non robot bought a solution
well I think that we're just about none

652
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:07,829
well I think that we're just about none
 

653
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:11,750
well I think that we're just about none
of the way to achieving the potential of

654
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:11,760
of the way to achieving the potential of
 

655
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,300
of the way to achieving the potential of
robotics at home but we have to do it in

656
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:14,310
robotics at home but we have to do it in
 

657
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:19,790
robotics at home but we have to do it in
a really eyes wide open

658
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:19,800
a really eyes wide open
 

659
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:23,000
a really eyes wide open
honest fashion and so another way to put

660
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,010
honest fashion and so another way to put
 

661
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:25,490
honest fashion and so another way to put
that is the potentials infinite because

662
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:25,500
that is the potentials infinite because
 

663
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,260
that is the potentials infinite because
we did take a few steps but you're

664
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:27,270
we did take a few steps but you're
 

665
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:29,030
we did take a few steps but you're
saying those steps is just very initial

666
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:29,040
saying those steps is just very initial
 

667
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,800
saying those steps is just very initial
steps so the Rumba is a hugely

668
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:30,810
steps so the Rumba is a hugely
 

669
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:33,020
steps so the Rumba is a hugely
successful product but you're saying

670
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:33,030
successful product but you're saying
 

671
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:35,270
successful product but you're saying
that's just the very very just the very

672
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:35,280
that's just the very very just the very
 

673
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,460
that's just the very very just the very
very beginning it's the foot in the door

674
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:37,470
very beginning it's the foot in the door
 

675
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:42,620
very beginning it's the foot in the door
and you know I think I was lucky that in

676
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:42,630
and you know I think I was lucky that in
 

677
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:45,620
and you know I think I was lucky that in
the early days of robotics people would

678
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:45,630
the early days of robotics people would
 

679
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:47,530
the early days of robotics people would
ask me when are you gonna clean my floor

680
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:47,540
ask me when are you gonna clean my floor
 

681
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:52,780
ask me when are you gonna clean my floor
it was something that I grew up saying I

682
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:52,790
it was something that I grew up saying I
 

683
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:54,740
it was something that I grew up saying I
got all these really good ideas but

684
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:54,750
got all these really good ideas but
 

685
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,080
got all these really good ideas but
everyone seems to want their floor clean

686
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:57,090
everyone seems to want their floor clean
 

687
00:17:57,090 --> 00:18:02,420
everyone seems to want their floor clean
and so maybe we should do that Betty

688
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:02,430
and so maybe we should do that Betty
 

689
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:04,340
and so maybe we should do that Betty
your good ideas earned the right to do

690
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:04,350
your good ideas earned the right to do
 

691
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,230
your good ideas earned the right to do
the next thing after that so the good

692
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:06,240
the next thing after that so the good
 

693
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,260
the next thing after that so the good
ideas have to match with the desire of

694
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:09,270
ideas have to match with the desire of
 

695
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:12,290
ideas have to match with the desire of
the people and then the actual cost has

696
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:12,300
the people and then the actual cost has
 

697
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,840
the people and then the actual cost has
to like the business the financial

698
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:14,850
to like the business the financial
 

699
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:17,830
to like the business the financial
aspect has to all mash together yeah I

700
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:17,840
aspect has to all mash together yeah I
 

701
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,810
aspect has to all mash together yeah I
during our partnership back a number of

702
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:20,820
during our partnership back a number of
 

703
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,510
during our partnership back a number of
years ago Johnson wax they would explain

704
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:23,520
years ago Johnson wax they would explain
 

705
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:28,970
years ago Johnson wax they would explain
to me that they would go into homes and

706
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:28,980
to me that they would go into homes and
 

707
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:32,870
to me that they would go into homes and
just watch how people lived and try to

708
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:32,880
just watch how people lived and try to
 

709
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,040
just watch how people lived and try to
figure out what were they doing that

710
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:36,050
figure out what were they doing that
 

711
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:40,100
figure out what were they doing that
they really didn't really like to do but

712
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:40,110
they really didn't really like to do but
 

713
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:42,590
they really didn't really like to do but
they had to do it frequently enough that

714
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:42,600
they had to do it frequently enough that
 

715
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,760
they had to do it frequently enough that
it was top of mind and and understood as

716
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:46,770
it was top of mind and and understood as
 

717
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:54,230
it was top of mind and and understood as
a a burden hey let's make a product or

718
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:54,240
a a burden hey let's make a product or
 

719
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,690
a a burden hey let's make a product or
come up with a solution to make that

720
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:56,700
come up with a solution to make that
 

721
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,940
come up with a solution to make that
pain point

722
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:57,950
pain point
 

723
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:03,320
pain point
lesyk less challenging and sometimes we

724
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:03,330
lesyk less challenging and sometimes we
 

725
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:06,920
lesyk less challenging and sometimes we
do certain burdens so often as a society

726
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:06,930
do certain burdens so often as a society
 

727
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:09,530
do certain burdens so often as a society
that we actually don't even realize like

728
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:09,540
that we actually don't even realize like
 

729
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,940
that we actually don't even realize like
it's actually hard to see that that

730
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:10,950
it's actually hard to see that that
 

731
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,260
it's actually hard to see that that
burden is something that could be

732
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:12,270
burden is something that could be
 

733
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:15,170
burden is something that could be
removed so it does require just going

734
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:15,180
removed so it does require just going
 

735
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,840
removed so it does require just going
into the home and staring it wait how do

736
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:17,850
into the home and staring it wait how do
 

737
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:20,240
into the home and staring it wait how do
I actually live life what are the pain

738
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:20,250
I actually live life what are the pain
 

739
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:22,610
I actually live life what are the pain
points yeah and it getting those

740
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:22,620
points yeah and it getting those
 

741
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:26,960
points yeah and it getting those
insights is a lot harder than it would

742
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:26,970
insights is a lot harder than it would
 

743
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:30,680
insights is a lot harder than it would
seem it should be in retrospect so how

744
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:30,690
seem it should be in retrospect so how
 

745
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:34,600
seem it should be in retrospect so how
hard on that point I mean one of the big

746
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:34,610
hard on that point I mean one of the big
 

747
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:38,570
hard on that point I mean one of the big
challenges of robotics is driving the

748
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:38,580
challenges of robotics is driving the
 

749
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:41,120
challenges of robotics is driving the
cost to something driving the cost down

750
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:41,130
cost to something driving the cost down
 

751
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:44,230
cost to something driving the cost down
to something that consumers people would

752
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:44,240
to something that consumers people would
 

753
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,170
to something that consumers people would
afford so people would be less likely to

754
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:48,180
afford so people would be less likely to
 

755
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:51,460
afford so people would be less likely to
buy a Roomba for cost $500,000 right

756
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:51,470
buy a Roomba for cost $500,000 right
 

757
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:54,470
buy a Roomba for cost $500,000 right
which is probably sort of what a Roomba

758
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:54,480
which is probably sort of what a Roomba
 

759
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,430
which is probably sort of what a Roomba
would costs

760
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:55,440
would costs
 

761
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,200
would costs
several decades ago so how do you drive

762
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:00,210
several decades ago so how do you drive
 

763
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:02,360
several decades ago so how do you drive
which I mention is very difficult how do

764
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:02,370
which I mention is very difficult how do
 

765
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:04,040
which I mention is very difficult how do
you drive the cost of a Roomba or a

766
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:04,050
you drive the cost of a Roomba or a
 

767
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:06,200
you drive the cost of a Roomba or a
robot down such that people wouldn't

768
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:06,210
robot down such that people wouldn't
 

769
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:08,570
robot down such that people wouldn't
want to buy it when I started building

770
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:08,580
want to buy it when I started building
 

771
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,990
want to buy it when I started building
robots the cost of the robot had a lot

772
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:12,000
robots the cost of the robot had a lot
 

773
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,210
robots the cost of the robot had a lot
to do with the amount of time it took to

774
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:14,220
to do with the amount of time it took to
 

775
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,970
to do with the amount of time it took to
build it and so that we build our robots

776
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:16,980
build it and so that we build our robots
 

777
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,610
build it and so that we build our robots
out of aluminum I would go spend my time

778
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:19,620
out of aluminum I would go spend my time
 

779
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,980
out of aluminum I would go spend my time
in the machine shop on the milling

780
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:21,990
in the machine shop on the milling
 

781
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:25,880
in the machine shop on the milling
machine cutting out the the the parts

782
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:25,890
machine cutting out the the the parts
 

783
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:28,760
machine cutting out the the the parts
and and so forth and then when we got

784
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:28,770
and and so forth and then when we got
 

785
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:32,630
and and so forth and then when we got
into the toy industry I realized that if

786
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:32,640
into the toy industry I realized that if
 

787
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,700
into the toy industry I realized that if
we were building at scale I could

788
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:34,710
we were building at scale I could
 

789
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:36,110
we were building at scale I could
determine the cost of the rope instead

790
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:36,120
determine the cost of the rope instead
 

791
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,330
determine the cost of the rope instead
of adding up all the hours to mill out

792
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:38,340
of adding up all the hours to mill out
 

793
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:43,130
of adding up all the hours to mill out
the parts but by weighing it and that's

every home in the world
 

1013
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:33,590
every home in the world
one day I expect there to be at least

know we've we've sold 25 million robots

1018
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:40,280
know we've we've sold 25 million robots
 

1019
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:43,750
know we've we've sold 25 million robots
so we're in about 10 percent of US homes

1020
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:43,760
so we're in about 10 percent of US homes
 

1021
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,780
so we're in about 10 percent of US homes
which is a great start but I think that

1022
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:47,790
which is a great start but I think that
 

1023
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:51,170
which is a great start but I think that
when we think about the numbers of

00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:30,330
see that I you know I think the
 

1051
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:32,560
see that I you know I think the
possibilities there are indeed infinite

fiction and so on there's a serious kind

1058
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:43,260
fiction and so on there's a serious kind
 

1059
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:45,950
fiction and so on there's a serious kind
of hesitation anxiety concern about

1060
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:45,960
of hesitation anxiety concern about
 

1061
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:49,930
of hesitation anxiety concern about
robots and also a concern about privacy

1062
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:49,940
robots and also a concern about privacy
 

1063
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:54,550
robots and also a concern about privacy
and it's a fascinating question to me

1064
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:54,560
and it's a fascinating question to me
 

1065
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:58,790
and it's a fascinating question to me
why that concern is amongst a certain

1066
00:27:58,790 --> 00:27:58,800
why that concern is amongst a certain
 

1067
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:02,150
why that concern is amongst a certain
group of people as as intense as it is

1068
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:02,160
group of people as as intense as it is
 

1069
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,370
group of people as as intense as it is
so you have to think about it because

1070
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:04,380
so you have to think about it because
 

1071
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,980
so you have to think about it because
it's a serious concern but I wonder how

1072
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:06,990
it's a serious concern but I wonder how
 

1073
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:08,390
it's a serious concern but I wonder how
you address it best so from a

1074
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:08,400
you address it best so from a
 

1075
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,520
you address it best so from a
perspective of a vision sensor so robots

1076
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:10,530
perspective of a vision sensor so robots
 

1077
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:12,920
perspective of a vision sensor so robots
that move about the home and sense the

people's privacy concerns how do you

1082
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:20,070
people's privacy concerns how do you
 

1083
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:21,560
people's privacy concerns how do you
make sure that they can trust

1084
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:21,570
make sure that they can trust

build a semantic map of your home and
 

1143
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,340
build a semantic map of your home and
know where the rooms are well then you

1144
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:09,350
know where the rooms are well then you
 

1145
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:12,100
know where the rooms are well then you
can say clean the kitchen if you don't

1146
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:12,110
can say clean the kitchen if you don't

can say clean the kitchen if you don't
want to robot to do that don't make the

00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:14,090
want to robot to do that don't make the
 

1149
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:16,210
want to robot to do that don't make the
map it'll do its best job cleaning your

1150
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:16,220

1151
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:18,280
map it'll do its best job cleaning your
home but it won't be able to do that and

1152
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:18,290
home but it won't be able to do that and
 

1153
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:20,560
home but it won't be able to do that and
if you ever want us to forget that we

1154
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:20,570
if you ever want us to forget that we
 

1155
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:23,830
if you ever want us to forget that we
know that it's your kitchen you can have

know that it's your kitchen you can have

confidence that we will do that for you
 

1159
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:31,710
confidence that we will do that for you
so we're trying to go and be a sort of a

1160
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:31,720
so we're trying to go and be a sort of a
 

1161
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:36,130
so we're trying to go and be a sort of a
data 2.0 perspective company where we

1162
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:36,140
data 2.0 perspective company where we
 

1163
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:38,800
data 2.0 perspective company where we
treat the data that the robots average

1164
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:38,810
treat the data that the robots average
 

1165
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:41,620
treat the data that the robots average
of the consumers home as if it were the

00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:41,630
of the consumers home as if it were the
 

1167
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:45,670
of the consumers home as if it were the
consumers data and that they have rights

consumers data and that they have rights
 

1169
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:50,050
consumers data and that they have rights
to it so we think by being the good guys

1170
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:50,060
to it so we think by being the good guys
 

1171
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:52,390
to it so we think by being the good guys
on this front we can build the trust and

1172
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:52,400
on this front we can build the trust and
 

1173
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:57,760
on this front we can build the trust and
thus be entrusted to enable robots to do

thus be entrusted to enable robots to do

thus be entrusted to enable robots to do

over time as a society broadly speaking

do you think you can win over trust not

do you think you can win over trust not

do you think you can win over trust not
just for the company but just the

just for the company but just the

we're less about winning them over and

we're less about winning them over and
more about finding a way to talk about

more about finding a way to talk about
 

1195
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:27,580
more about finding a way to talk about
privacy in a way that more people can

very upset and then then go to the store
 

1203
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,740
very upset and then then go to the store
and buy the cheapest thing paying no

1204
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:38,750
and buy the cheapest thing paying no

the privacy commitments that we have I

nothing at all and that needs to change
 

1221
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:01,680
nothing at all and that needs to change
so it's it's not a question about

so it's it's not a question about
 

1223
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:03,810
so it's it's not a question about
earning trust I think that's necessary

00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:03,820
earning trust I think that's necessary

by not sufficient we need to figure out

that will reward companies for good

behavior and that will ultimately be how

the conversation between regular people

the conversation between regular people
about what it means what privacy means

about what it means what privacy means
 

1247
00:32:35,409 --> 00:32:37,740
about what it means what privacy means
if you have some standards you can say

if you have some standards you can say
 

1249
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:40,380
if you have some standards you can say
you're gonna start talking about who's

you're gonna start talking about who's
 

1251
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:42,269
you're gonna start talking about who's

would be nice to change that for people

would be nice to change that for people
 

1261
00:32:50,409 --> 00:32:52,649
would be nice to change that for people
to understand the good that AI can do

1301
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,520

something and it could be about what

more energy-efficient it could be about
you know if I'm thinking about climbing

1330
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:40,040
you know if I'm thinking about climbing
 

1331
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:43,680
you know if I'm thinking about climbing
Mount Everest what should I know and

1332
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:43,690
Mount Everest what should I know and
 

1333
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:48,849
Mount Everest what should I know and
that's a very doable thing you know but

1334
00:34:48,849 --> 00:34:48,859
that's a very doable thing you know but
 

1335
00:34:48,859 --> 00:34:51,700
that's a very doable thing you know but
if I think that that conversation gonna

1336
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:51,710
if I think that that conversation gonna
 

1337
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:54,099
if I think that that conversation gonna
have of the robot is I'm gonna be

1338
00:34:54,099 --> 00:34:54,109
have of the robot is I'm gonna be
 

1339
00:34:54,109 --> 00:34:57,010
have of the robot is I'm gonna be
rewarded by making the robot happy but I

1340
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:57,020
rewarded by making the robot happy but I
 

1341
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,359
rewarded by making the robot happy but I
couldn't have just put a button on the

1342
00:34:58,359 --> 00:34:58,369
couldn't have just put a button on the
 

1343
00:34:58,369 --> 00:34:59,829
couldn't have just put a button on the
robot you could push in the robot would

1344
00:34:59,829 --> 00:34:59,839
robot you could push in the robot would
 

1345
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:02,410
robot you could push in the robot would
smile and that sort of thing so I think

1346
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:02,420
smile and that sort of thing so I think
 

1347
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:04,299
smile and that sort of thing so I think
you need to think about the question in

1348
00:35:04,299 --> 00:35:04,309
you need to think about the question in
 

1349
00:35:04,309 --> 00:35:09,450
you need to think about the question in
the the right way and and robots can be

1350
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:09,460
the the right way and and robots can be
 

1351
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:12,520
the the right way and and robots can be
awesomely effective at helping people

and save the galaxy and I'm really

interested actually in emotion and

interested actually in emotion and
robotics and I think he'd have a lot to

robotics and I think he'd have a lot to
 

1381
00:36:02,329 --> 00:36:04,299
robotics and I think he'd have a lot to
say about that because I believe

1382
00:36:04,299 --> 00:36:04,309
say about that because I believe
 

1383
00:36:04,309 --> 00:36:08,589
say about that because I believe
actually that emotion play is an

1384
00:36:08,589 --> 00:36:08,599
actually that emotion play is an
 

1385
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:11,849
actually that emotion play is an

going on in social situations on there's

going on in social situations on there's
been perfect information in social

been perfect information in social

situations also in competitive or
 

1397
00:36:25,549 --> 00:36:28,540
situations also in competitive or
dangerous situations

dangerous situations
 

1399

dangerous situations
that we have a motion for a reason and

that we have a motion for a reason and
 

1401
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:36,430
that we have a motion for a reason and
so that ultimately this my theory is

1402
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:36,440
so that ultimately this my theory is
 

1403
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,320
so that ultimately this my theory is
that as robots get smart and smarter

1404
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:38,330
that as robots get smart and smarter
 

1405
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:39,340
that as robots get smart and smarter
they're actually going to get more

1406
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:39,350
they're actually going to get more
 

1407
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:46,050
they're actually going to get more
emotional because you can't actually

1408
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:46,060
emotional because you can't actually
 

1409
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:50,650
emotional because you can't actually
survive on pure logic because only a

1410
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:50,660
survive on pure logic because only a
 

1411
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:53,890
survive on pure logic because only a
very tiny fraction of the situations you

1412
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:53,900
very tiny fraction of the situations you
 

1413
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,540
very tiny fraction of the situations you
find ourselves and can be resolved

1414
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:55,550
find ourselves and can be resolved
 

1415
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:57,850
find ourselves and can be resolved
reasonably with logic and so I think

1416
00:36:57,850 --> 00:36:57,860
reasonably with logic and so I think
 

1417
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:59,290
reasonably with logic and so I think
data would have a lot to say about that

1418
00:36:59,290 --> 00:36:59,300
data would have a lot to say about that
 

1419
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,850
data would have a lot to say about that
and so I could find out whether he

1420
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:00,860
and so I could find out whether he
 

1421
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:04,180
and so I could find out whether he
agrees what if you could ask data one

1422
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:04,190
agrees what if you could ask data one
 

1423
