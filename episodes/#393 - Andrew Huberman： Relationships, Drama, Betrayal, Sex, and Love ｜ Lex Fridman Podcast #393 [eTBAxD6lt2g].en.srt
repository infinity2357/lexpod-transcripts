to train like a lazy bear and just lift

118
00:02:17,449 --> 00:02:17,459
to train like a lazy bear and just lift
 

119
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:18,770
to train like a lazy bear and just lift
heavy objects but I've also started

120
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:18,780
heavy objects but I've also started
 

121
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,630
heavy objects but I've also started
training with lighter weights and higher

122
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:20,640
training with lighter weights and higher
 

123
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,610
training with lighter weights and higher
repetitions and

124
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:22,620
repetitions and
 

125
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,610
repetitions and
um for three month cycles and it gives

126
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:25,620
um for three month cycles and it gives
 

127
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,890
um for three month cycles and it gives
your joints a rest and um yeah so

128
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:27,900
your joints a rest and um yeah so
 

129
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,110
your joints a rest and um yeah so
probably you know it I think it also is

130
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:30,120
probably you know it I think it also is
 

131
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,250
probably you know it I think it also is
interesting to see how training

132
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:31,260
interesting to see how training
 

133
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,110
interesting to see how training
differently changes your cognition

134
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:33,120
differently changes your cognition
 

135
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,210
differently changes your cognition
that's probably hormone related you know

136
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:35,220
that's probably hormone related you know
 

137
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,130
that's probably hormone related you know
hormones Downstream of training heavy

138
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:37,140
hormones Downstream of training heavy
 

139
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,930
hormones Downstream of training heavy
versus hormones Downstream of training a

140
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:38,940
versus hormones Downstream of training a
 

141
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,490
versus hormones Downstream of training a
little bit lighter

142
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:40,500
little bit lighter
 

143
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,350
little bit lighter
um I think my cognition is better when

144
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:42,360
um I think my cognition is better when
 

145
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,470
um I think my cognition is better when
I'm doing more cardio and when the

146
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:45,480
I'm doing more cardio and when the
 

147
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,710
I'm doing more cardio and when the
repetition ranges are a little bit

148
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:47,720
repetition ranges are a little bit
 

149
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,210
repetition ranges are a little bit
higher which is not to say that people

150
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:50,220
higher which is not to say that people
 

151
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:53,390
higher which is not to say that people

different
 

165
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:07,309
different
challenge than running hard for 90

166
00:03:07,309 --> 00:03:07,319

minutes

168
00:03:08,449 --> 00:03:08,459
minutes
 

169
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:10,070
minutes
that's a tough thing just like getting

170
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:10,080
that's a tough thing just like getting
 

171
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,750
that's a tough thing just like getting
in an ice bath people say oh well how is

172
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:11,760
in an ice bath people say oh well how is
 

173
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,030
in an ice bath people say oh well how is
that any different than working out

174
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:14,040
that any different than working out
 

175
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,990
that any different than working out
um well there are a lot of differences

176
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:15,000
um well there are a lot of differences
 

177
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,050
um well there are a lot of differences
but one of them is that it's very acute

178
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:18,060
but one of them is that it's very acute
 

179
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,509
but one of them is that it's very acute
stress within one second you're stressed

180
00:03:20,509 --> 00:03:20,519
stress within one second you're stressed
 

181
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:23,509
stress within one second you're stressed
so I I think subjecting the body to a

182
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:23,519
so I I think subjecting the body to a
 

183
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,030
so I I think subjecting the body to a
bunch of different types of stressors in

184
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:26,040
bunch of different types of stressors in
 

185
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,309
bunch of different types of stressors in
space and time is really valuable so

186
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:28,319
space and time is really valuable so
 

187
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,270
space and time is really valuable so
yeah I've been playing with the

188
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:29,280
yeah I've been playing with the
 

189
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,770
yeah I've been playing with the
variables in a pretty systematic way

190
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:30,780
variables in a pretty systematic way
 

191
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:34,490
variables in a pretty systematic way
well I like long and slow

192
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:34,500
well I like long and slow
 

193
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,130
well I like long and slow
for like you said the impact it has on

194
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:37,140
for like you said the impact it has on
 

195
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,710
for like you said the impact it has on
my cognition yeah it it uh the

196
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:39,720
my cognition yeah it it uh the
 

197
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,509
my cognition yeah it it uh the
wordlessness of it

198
00:03:41,509 --> 00:03:41,519
wordlessness of it
 

199
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,270
wordlessness of it
um the way it puts you in in a the way

200

00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:49,620
um it can take away that hyper focus and
 

207
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,589
um it can take away that hyper focus and
put you more in a relaxed

put you more in a relaxed
 

209
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,770
put you more in a relaxed
Focus for sure well for me it brings the

Clutter to the surface at first like all
these thoughts come in there and then

214
00:03:58,970 --> 00:03:58,980
these thoughts come in there and then

knew it was there
and then

462
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:27,360
and then
 

463
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,850

now the reverse has also been true that

476
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:40,680
now the reverse has also been true that
 

477
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,110
now the reverse has also been true that
there have been a number of instances in

which I feel sort of immediate delight
 

481
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,769

um but he said and I believe that the
 

781
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:15,110
um but he said and I believe that the
subconscious is the super computer of

782
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:15,120
subconscious is the super computer of
 

783
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,090
subconscious is the super computer of
the brain all the stuff working

784
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:17,100
the brain all the stuff working
 

785
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,590
the brain all the stuff working
underneath our conscious awareness

786
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:18,600
underneath our conscious awareness
 

787
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,050
underneath our conscious awareness
that's driving our feelings and our what

788
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:21,060
that's driving our feelings and our what
 

789
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,210
that's driving our feelings and our what
we think are the decisions that we've

790
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:23,220
we think are the decisions that we've
 

791
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,190
we think are the decisions that we've
thought through so carefully and that

792
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:25,200
thought through so carefully and that
 

793
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,889
thought through so carefully and that
only by exploring the subconscious and

794
00:14:27,889 --> 00:14:27,899
only by exploring the subconscious and
 

795
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:29,930
only by exploring the subconscious and
understanding it a little bit

796
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:29,940
understanding it a little bit
 

797
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,449
understanding it a little bit
um can we actually uh

798
00:14:32,449 --> 00:14:32,459
um can we actually uh
 

799
00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:35,150
um can we actually uh
improve ourselves over time and I agree

800
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:35,160
improve ourselves over time and I agree
 

801
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:38,389
improve ourselves over time and I agree
I think that so that the mistake is to

802
00:14:38,389 --> 00:14:38,399

you back to the table to do work in a
 

1307
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,390
you back to the table to do work in a
way that feels self-flagellating and

1308
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:50,400
way that feels self-flagellating and

00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:01,250
chemicals but I think it is good to do
hard things but you have to be careful

1434
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:01,260
hard things but you have to be careful

think uh we all you know I have
 

1463

think uh we all you know I have
different RPM that you know we all kind

1464
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:33,900
different RPM that you know we all kind
 

1465
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,990
different RPM that you know we all kind
of idle at different RPM and

1466
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:36,000
of idle at different RPM and
 

1467
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,330
of idle at different RPM and
um some people are big mellow costellos

1468
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:38,340
um some people are big mellow costellos
 

1469
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,769
um some people are big mellow costellos
and others are kind of like you know

and others are kind of like you know
 

1471
00:26:39,779 --> 00:26:42,649
and others are kind of like you know
need more friction in order to to feel

1472
00:26:42,649 --> 00:26:42,659
need more friction in order to to feel
 

1473
00:26:42,659 --> 00:26:44,750
need more friction in order to to feel
at peace but I think ultimately what we

1474
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:44,760
at peace but I think ultimately what we
 

1475
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,269
at peace but I think ultimately what we
want is to feel at peace

1476

want is to feel at peace
 

1477

think
 

1483
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,090
think
the reason could be boiled out

1484
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:56,100
the reason could be boiled out
 

1485
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,070
the reason could be boiled out
to the fact that I haven't been able to

1486
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:58,080
to the fact that I haven't been able to
 

1487

and as they said that I felt the anger
dissipate and so there was something

1871
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,870
can't get distracted just you just at
some point but the but the problem I

1872
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:53,880
some point but the but the problem I
 

1873
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,610
some point but the but the problem I
think in just laughing at something like

1874
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:55,620
think in just laughing at something like
 

1875
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,350
think in just laughing at something like
that gives you distance

1876
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:57,360
that gives you distance
 

1877
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,149
that gives you distance
but the question is

1878
00:33:59,149 --> 00:33:59,159
but the question is
 

1879
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:01,669
but the question is
does do you stop engaging with it at

1880
00:34:01,669 --> 00:34:01,679
does do you stop engaging with it at
 

1881
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:04,850
does do you stop engaging with it at
that point like I experienced this I

1882
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:04,860
that point like I experienced this I
 

1883
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:07,490
that point like I experienced this I
mean recently I got to see how sometimes

1884
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:07,500
mean recently I got to see how sometimes
 

1885
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,050
mean recently I got to see how sometimes
I'll see something that's just like what

1886
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:09,060
I'll see something that's just like what
 

1887
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:11,750
I'll see something that's just like what
like this is crazy so I just laugh but

1888
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:11,760
like this is crazy so I just laugh but
 

1889
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,669
like this is crazy so I just laugh but
then I continue to engage in it and it's

1890
00:34:13,669 --> 00:34:13,679
then I continue to engage in it and it's
 

1891
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,909
then I continue to engage in it and it's
taking me off of course and so there is

1892
00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:16,919
taking me off of course and so there is
 

1893
00:34:16,919 --> 00:34:18,950
taking me off of course and so there is
a place where you know I mean I get

um there's also the Shakespearean drama
 

2507
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:42,829
um there's also the Shakespearean drama
of the characters that exit the play and

2508
00:45:42,829 --> 00:45:42,839
of the characters that exit the play and
 

2509

backdrop it just doesn't make for as
much entertainment

2514
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:49,260

 

2515
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:52,069

that's one other thing that's a benefit

started doing it this last year I think
because

2594
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:14,280
because
 

2595
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:16,849

um it helps me understand just how many
 

2597
00:47:16,859 --> 00:47:19,309
um it helps me understand just how many
different uh contexts I have to exist in

that that the brain of a human is is

2648
00:48:06,069 --> 00:48:06,079
that that the brain of a human is is
 

2649
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:09,050
that that the brain of a human is is
marvelously complex but also

2650
00:48:09,050 --> 00:48:09,060
marvelously complex but also
 

2651
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:11,930
marvelously complex but also
um marvelously uh self-defeating at

2652
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:11,940
um marvelously uh self-defeating at
 

2653
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:13,309
um marvelously uh self-defeating at
times and so I've been thinking about

2654
00:48:13,309 --> 00:48:13,319
times and so I've been thinking about
 

2655
00:48:13,319 --> 00:48:14,690
times and so I've been thinking about
these things in the context of the

2656
00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:14,700
these things in the context of the
 

2657
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:15,890
these things in the context of the
different roles and the whole thing

2658
00:48:15,890 --> 00:48:15,900
different roles and the whole thing
 

2659
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:17,870
different roles and the whole thing
takes about four or five minutes and I

2660
00:48:17,870 --> 00:48:17,880
takes about four or five minutes and I
 

2661
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:19,250
takes about four or five minutes and I
just find it brings me a certain amount

2662
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:19,260
just find it brings me a certain amount
 

2663
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:20,930
just find it brings me a certain amount
of clarity that then allows me to

2664
00:48:20,930 --> 00:48:20,940
of clarity that then allows me to
 

2665
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:23,690
of clarity that then allows me to
ratchet into the day the prayer piece um

2666
00:48:23,690 --> 00:48:23,700
ratchet into the day the prayer piece um
 

2667
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:26,390
ratchet into the day the prayer piece um

um but it's a it's becoming a bigger
 

2829

00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:41,030
thought I'd talk like this
um but

2834
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:41,040
um but
 

2835
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:42,829
um but
I think

2836
00:51:42,829 --> 00:51:42,839
I think
 

2837
00:51:42,839 --> 00:51:45,829
I think
it's clear to me that

2838
00:51:45,829 --> 00:51:45,839
it's clear to me that
 

2839
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:47,750
it's clear to me that
if we don't

2840
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:47,760
if we don't
 

2841
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:50,750
if we don't
believe in something

2842
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:50,760
believe in something
 

2843
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:52,849
believe in something
again doesn't have to be traditional

2844
00:51:52,849 --> 00:51:52,859
again doesn't have to be traditional
 

2845
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:54,349
again doesn't have to be traditional
standardized religion but if we don't

2846
00:51:54,349 --> 00:51:54,359
standardized religion but if we don't
 

2847
00:51:54,359 --> 00:51:55,910
standardized religion but if we don't
believe in something bigger than

2848
00:51:55,910 --> 00:51:55,920
believe in something bigger than
 

2849
00:51:55,920 --> 00:52:00,170
believe in something bigger than
ourselves we uh at some level will

2850
00:52:00,170 --> 00:52:00,180
ourselves we uh at some level will
 

2851
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:01,970
ourselves we uh at some level will
self-destruct

2852
00:52:01,970 --> 00:52:01,980
self-destruct
 

2853
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:04,250
self-destruct
I really I really think so it's power

2854
00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:04,260
I really I really think so it's power
 

2855
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:06,829
I really I really think so it's power
and it's powerful in a way that all the

2856
00:52:06,829 --> 00:52:06,839
and it's powerful in a way that all the
 

2857
00:52:06,839 --> 00:52:08,569
and it's powerful in a way that all the
other stuff meditation and all the tools

2858
00:52:08,569 --> 00:52:08,579
other stuff meditation and all the tools
 

2859
00:52:08,579 --> 00:52:11,510
other stuff meditation and all the tools
is is not because it's really operating

2860
00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:11,520
is is not because it's really operating
 

2861
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:16,250
is is not because it's really operating
at a much deeper and bigger level and um

2862
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:16,260
at a much deeper and bigger level and um
 

2863
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:17,630
at a much deeper and bigger level and um
you know if

2864
00:52:17,630 --> 00:52:17,640
you know if
 

2865
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:20,210
you know if
yeah I think I think that's all I can

2866
00:52:20,210 --> 00:52:20,220
yeah I think I think that's all I can
 

2867
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:23,150
yeah I think I think that's all I can
talk about it um mostly because I'm

2868
00:52:23,150 --> 00:52:23,160
talk about it um mostly because I'm
 

2869
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:25,069
talk about it um mostly because I'm
still working out you know the

2870
00:52:25,069 --> 00:52:25,079
still working out you know the
 

2871
00:52:25,079 --> 00:52:26,450
still working out you know the
scientists in me wants to understand how

2872
00:52:26,450 --> 00:52:26,460
scientists in me wants to understand how
 

2873
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:28,130
scientists in me wants to understand how
it works and I want to understand and

2874
00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:28,140
it works and I want to understand and
 

2875
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:30,470
it works and I want to understand and
the point is to just go you know

2876
00:52:30,470 --> 00:52:30,480
the point is to just go you know
 

2877
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,630
the point is to just go you know
there's some there's you know for lack

2878
00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:32,640
there's some there's you know for lack
 

2879
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,190
there's some there's you know for lack
of a better language for it there's

2880
00:52:34,190 --> 00:52:34,200
of a better language for it there's
 

2881
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:36,650
of a better language for it there's
higher power than me and what I can

2882
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:36,660
higher power than me and what I can
 

2883
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:39,049
higher power than me and what I can
control I'm giving up control on certain

2884
00:52:39,049 --> 00:52:39,059
control I'm giving up control on certain
 

2885
00:52:39,059 --> 00:52:41,870
control I'm giving up control on certain
things and somehow that restores a sense

2886
00:52:41,870 --> 00:52:41,880
things and somehow that restores a sense
 

2887
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:43,430
things and somehow that restores a sense
of agency

2888
00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:43,440
of agency
 

2889
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:46,370
of agency
for for right action better action I

2890
00:52:46,370 --> 00:52:46,380
for for right action better action I
 

2891
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:48,890
for for right action better action I
think perhaps a part of that is just the

2892
00:52:48,890 --> 00:52:48,900
think perhaps a part of that is just the
 

2893
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:51,109
think perhaps a part of that is just the
humility that comes with acknowledging

2894
00:52:51,109 --> 00:52:51,119
humility that comes with acknowledging
 

2895
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:52,490
humility that comes with acknowledging
there's something bigger and more

2896
00:52:52,490 --> 00:52:52,500
there's something bigger and more
 

2897
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:53,990
there's something bigger and more
powerful than you and then you can't

2898
00:52:53,990 --> 00:52:54,000
powerful than you and then you can't
 

2899
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,390
powerful than you and then you can't
control everything yeah it's I mean that

2900
00:52:56,390 --> 00:52:56,400
control everything yeah it's I mean that
 

2901
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,250
control everything yeah it's I mean that

prayed for uh
the ability to be as brutally honest

2970
00:54:07,970 --> 00:54:07,980
the ability to be as brutally honest
 

2971
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:09,290
the ability to be as brutally honest
with myself

2972
00:54:09,290 --> 00:54:09,300
with myself
 

2973
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:11,089
with myself
and with other people as I possibly

2974
00:54:11,089 --> 00:54:11,099
and with other people as I possibly
 

2975
00:54:11,099 --> 00:54:12,829
and with other people as I possibly
could be about a particular situation I

2976
00:54:12,829 --> 00:54:12,839
could be about a particular situation I
 

2977
00:54:12,839 --> 00:54:14,270
could be about a particular situation I
was in at that time

2978

was in at that time
 

2979

was in at that time
I mean I I think now it's probably safe

2980
00:54:16,130 --> 00:54:16,140
I mean I I think now it's probably safe
 

2981
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:17,569
I mean I I think now it's probably safe
to say I'd gone off to college because

2982
00:54:17,569 --> 00:54:17,579
to say I'd gone off to college because
 

2983
00:54:17,579 --> 00:54:19,490
to say I'd gone off to college because

sometimes certain Protocols are a
 

3141
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,650
sometimes certain Protocols are a
combination of you know animal human and

3142
00:56:51,650 --> 00:56:51,660
combination of you know animal human and
 

3143
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:53,390
combination of you know animal human and
animal and human studies sometimes

clinical trials sometimes there's some
 

3147
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:58,309
clinical trials sometimes there's some
mechanistic conjecture for some not all

3148
00:56:58,309 --> 00:56:58,319
mechanistic conjecture for some not all
 

3149
00:56:58,319 --> 00:57:00,950
mechanistic conjecture for some not all
I always make clear which but in the end

figuring out how things work so that we
 

3155
00:57:05,579 --> 00:57:07,970

3187
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,190
gain a lot of knowledge and wisdom
through learning

3188
00:57:49,190 --> 00:57:49,200
through learning
 

3189
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,589
through learning
but a part of me believes that all the

3190
00:57:51,589 --> 00:57:51,599
but a part of me believes that all the
 

3191
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:54,950
but a part of me believes that all the
wisdom I need was all was there when I

3192
00:57:54,950 --> 00:57:54,960
wisdom I need was all was there when I
 

3193
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:55,609
wisdom I need was all was there when I
was

3194
00:57:55,609 --> 00:57:55,619
was
 

3195
00:57:55,619 --> 00:57:57,710

3197
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:00,410
11 and 12 years old
and then it got cluttered over well

3198
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:00,420
and then it got cluttered over well
 

3199

when he gets going about the

3204
00:58:05,990 --> 00:58:06,000
when he gets going about the
 

3205
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,609
when he gets going about the
subconscious and the amount of this that

3206
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:07,619
subconscious and the amount of this that
 

3207
00:58:07,619 --> 00:58:09,290
subconscious and the amount of this that
sits below the surface like an iceberg

3208
00:58:09,290 --> 00:58:09,300
sits below the surface like an iceberg
 

3209
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:10,190
sits below the surface like an iceberg
and

3210
00:58:10,190 --> 00:58:10,200
and
 

3211
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:13,130
and
and I and the fact that when we're kids

3212
00:58:13,130 --> 00:58:13,140
and I and the fact that when we're kids
 

3213
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:14,890
and I and the fact that when we're kids
we're not

3214
00:58:14,890 --> 00:58:14,900
we're not
 

3215
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:17,390
we're not
obscuring a lot of that subconscious as

3216
00:58:17,390 --> 00:58:17,400
obscuring a lot of that subconscious as
 

3217
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:19,910
obscuring a lot of that subconscious as
much and and sometimes that can look a

3218
00:58:19,910 --> 00:58:19,920
much and and sometimes that can look a
 

3219
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:23,030
much and and sometimes that can look a
little more primitive I mean I mean a

3220
00:58:23,030 --> 00:58:23,040
little more primitive I mean I mean a
 

3221
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:25,790
little more primitive I mean I mean a
kid that's disappointed will let you

3222
00:58:25,790 --> 00:58:25,800
kid that's disappointed will let you
 

3223
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:28,490
kid that's disappointed will let you
know a kid that's excited will let you

3224
00:58:28,490 --> 00:58:28,500
know a kid that's excited will let you
 

3225
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:30,950
know a kid that's excited will let you
know and you feel that raw exuberance or

3226
00:58:30,950 --> 00:58:30,960
know and you feel that raw exuberance or
 

3227
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:34,609
know and you feel that raw exuberance or
that raw dismail and I think that

3228
00:58:34,609 --> 00:58:34,619
that raw dismail and I think that
 

3229
00:58:34,619 --> 00:58:36,049
that raw dismail and I think that
um as we grow older we learn to cover

3230
00:58:36,049 --> 00:58:36,059
um as we grow older we learn to cover
 

3231
00:58:36,059 --> 00:58:38,329
um as we grow older we learn to cover
that stuff up we we wear masks and we

3232
00:58:38,329 --> 00:58:38,339
that stuff up we we wear masks and we
 

3233
00:58:38,339 --> 00:58:40,010
that stuff up we we wear masks and we
have to to be functional right I don't

3234
00:58:40,010 --> 00:58:40,020
have to to be functional right I don't
 

3235
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:41,089
have to to be functional right I don't
think we all want to go around just

3236
00:58:41,089 --> 00:58:41,099
think we all want to go around just
 

3237
00:58:41,099 --> 00:58:42,770
think we all want to go around just
being completely

3238
00:58:42,770 --> 00:58:42,780
being completely
 

3239
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:46,130
being completely
um raw but as you said as you get older

3240
00:58:46,130 --> 00:58:46,140
um raw but as you said as you get older
 

3241
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:47,569
um raw but as you said as you get older
you also you get to this point where

3242
00:58:47,569 --> 00:58:47,579
you also you get to this point where
 

3243
00:58:47,579 --> 00:58:48,849
you also you get to this point where
you're gonna go

3244
00:58:48,849 --> 00:58:48,859
you're gonna go
 

3245
00:58:48,859 --> 00:58:51,589
you're gonna go
you know what what are we really trying

3246
00:58:51,589 --> 00:58:51,599
you know what what are we really trying
 

3247
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:53,690
you know what what are we really trying
to protect anyway I mean I have this

3248
00:58:53,690 --> 00:58:53,700
to protect anyway I mean I have this
 

3249
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:54,829
to protect anyway I mean I have this
theory that

3250
00:58:54,829 --> 00:58:54,839
theory that
 

3251
00:58:54,839 --> 00:58:57,349
theory that
you know certainly my experience has

3252
00:58:57,349 --> 00:58:57,359
you know certainly my experience has
 

3253
00:58:57,359 --> 00:59:01,730
you know certainly my experience has
taught me that a lot of people

3254
00:59:01,730 --> 00:59:01,740
taught me that a lot of people
 

3255
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:03,829
taught me that a lot of people
but

3256
00:59:03,829 --> 00:59:03,839
but
 

3257
00:59:03,839 --> 00:59:05,390
but
I'll talk about men because that's what

3258
00:59:05,390 --> 00:59:05,400
I'll talk about men because that's what
 

3259
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:07,370
I'll talk about men because that's what
I know best

3260
00:59:07,370 --> 00:59:07,380
I know best
 

3261
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:09,770
I know best
whether or not they show up strong or

3262
00:59:09,770 --> 00:59:09,780
whether or not they show up strong or
 

3263
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:10,789
whether or not they show up strong or
not

3264
00:59:10,789 --> 00:59:10,799
not
 

3265
00:59:10,799 --> 00:59:14,450
not
that they're really afraid of

3266
00:59:14,450 --> 00:59:14,460
that they're really afraid of
 

3267
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:17,270
that they're really afraid of
being weak like they're just afraid like

3268
00:59:17,270 --> 00:59:17,280
being weak like they're just afraid like
 

3269
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:18,770
being weak like they're just afraid like
sometimes the strength is even a way to

3270
00:59:18,770 --> 00:59:18,780
sometimes the strength is even a way to
 

3271
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:20,990
sometimes the strength is even a way to
try and not be weak right which is

3272
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:21,000
try and not be weak right which is
 

3273
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,789
try and not be weak right which is
different than being strong for its own

3274
00:59:22,789 --> 00:59:22,799
different than being strong for its own
 

3275
00:59:22,799 --> 00:59:24,230
different than being strong for its own
sake I'm not just talking about physical

00:59:43,619 --> 00:59:46,910
alpha in the group yeah and he's getting
older and so what does he do every once

3298
00:59:46,910 --> 00:59:46,920
older and so what does he do every once
 

3299
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:48,829
older and so what does he do every once
in a while he goes on these Vigor

3300
00:59:48,829 --> 00:59:48,839
in a while he goes on these Vigor
 

3301
00:59:48,839 --> 00:59:51,170
in a while he goes on these Vigor
displays he goes and he grabs Branch he

3302
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:51,180
displays he goes and he grabs Branch he
 

3303
00:59:51,180 --> 00:59:52,609
displays he goes and he grabs Branch he
starts breaking him he starts thrashing

3304
00:59:52,609 --> 00:59:52,619
starts breaking him he starts thrashing
 

3305
00:59:52,619 --> 00:59:53,690
starts breaking him he starts thrashing
him and he's incredibly strong and

3306
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:53,700
him and he's incredibly strong and
 

3307
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:55,370
him and he's incredibly strong and
they're all kind of like watching I mean

3308
00:59:55,370 --> 00:59:55,380
they're all kind of like watching I mean
 

3309
00:59:55,380 --> 00:59:57,049
they're all kind of like watching I mean
yeah I immediately think of people like

3310
00:59:57,049 --> 00:59:57,059
yeah I immediately think of people like
 

3311
00:59:57,059 --> 00:59:59,210
yeah I immediately think of people like
they're dead lifting on Instagram and I

3312
00:59:59,210 --> 00:59:59,220
they're dead lifting on Instagram and I
 

3313
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:01,849
they're dead lifting on Instagram and I
just think the displays a Vigor this is

3314
01:00:01,849 --> 01:00:01,859
just think the displays a Vigor this is
 

3315
01:00:01,859 --> 01:00:04,130
just think the displays a Vigor this is
just the primate sewing that displays

3316
01:00:04,130 --> 01:00:04,140
just the primate sewing that displays
 

3317
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:05,630
just the primate sewing that displays
the figure now what's interesting is

3318
01:00:05,630 --> 01:00:05,640
the figure now what's interesting is
 

3319
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:08,510
the figure now what's interesting is
that he's doing that specifically to say

3320
01:00:08,510 --> 01:00:08,520
that he's doing that specifically to say
 

3321
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:10,609
that he's doing that specifically to say
hey I still have what it takes to lead

3322
01:00:10,609 --> 01:00:10,619
hey I still have what it takes to lead
 

3323
01:00:10,619 --> 01:00:13,250
hey I still have what it takes to lead
this troop okay then they're the the

3324
01:00:13,250 --> 01:00:13,260
this troop okay then they're the the
 

3325
01:00:13,260 --> 01:00:16,190
this troop okay then they're the the
ones that are subordinate to him but not

3326
01:00:16,190 --> 01:00:16,200
ones that are subordinate to him but not
 

3327
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:19,010
ones that are subordinate to him but not
so not so far behind it seems to be that

3328
01:00:19,010 --> 01:00:19,020
so not so far behind it seems to be that
 

3329
01:00:19,020 --> 01:00:20,809
so not so far behind it seems to be that
there's a very clear like numerical

3330
01:00:20,809 --> 01:00:20,819
there's a very clear like numerical
 

3331
01:00:20,819 --> 01:00:23,150
there's a very clear like numerical
ranking there is like it's it's clear

3332
01:00:23,150 --> 01:00:23,160
ranking there is like it's it's clear
 

3333
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:25,190
ranking there is like it's it's clear
who's the number two number three yeah I

3334
01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:25,200
who's the number two number three yeah I
 

3335
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:26,930
who's the number two number three yeah I
mean who gets to mate first who gets to

3336
01:00:26,930 --> 01:00:26,940
mean who gets to mate first who gets to
 

3337
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:28,309
mean who gets to mate first who gets to
eat first this exists in other animal

3338
01:00:28,309 --> 01:00:28,319
eat first this exists in other animal
 

3339
01:00:28,319 --> 01:00:30,530
eat first this exists in other animal
societies too but uh Bob sapolski would

3340
01:00:30,530 --> 01:00:30,540
societies too but uh Bob sapolski would
 

3341
01:00:30,540 --> 01:00:31,670
societies too but uh Bob sapolski would
be a great person to talk about this

3342
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:31,680
be a great person to talk about this
 

3343
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:33,289
be a great person to talk about this
with because he knows obviously

3344
01:00:33,289 --> 01:00:33,299
with because he knows obviously
 

3345
01:00:33,299 --> 01:00:34,970
with because he knows obviously
tremendous amount about it and I I know

3346
01:00:34,970 --> 01:00:34,980
tremendous amount about it and I I know
 

3347
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:37,010
tremendous amount about it and I I know
just the top Contour but

3348
01:00:37,010 --> 01:00:37,020
just the top Contour but
 

3349
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:38,990
just the top Contour but
um yeah so number two three and four

3350
01:00:38,990 --> 01:00:39,000
um yeah so number two three and four
 

3351
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,329
um yeah so number two three and four
males are

3352
01:00:41,329 --> 01:00:41,339
males are
 

3353
01:00:41,339 --> 01:00:43,430
males are
aware that he's doing these Vigor

3354
01:00:43,430 --> 01:00:43,440
aware that he's doing these Vigor
 

3355
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:45,049
aware that he's doing these Vigor
displays but they're also aware because

3356
01:00:45,049 --> 01:00:45,059
displays but they're also aware because
 

3357
01:00:45,059 --> 01:00:47,210
displays but they're also aware because
in primary Evolution they got some extra

3358
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:47,220
in primary Evolution they got some extra
 

3359
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:49,370
in primary Evolution they got some extra
forebrain too not as much as us but they

3360
01:00:49,370 --> 01:00:49,380
forebrain too not as much as us but they
 

3361
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:51,170
forebrain too not as much as us but they
got some and they're aware that the

3362
01:00:51,170 --> 01:00:51,180
got some and they're aware that the
 

3363
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:55,069
got some and they're aware that the
Vigor displays are displays that because

3364
01:00:55,069 --> 01:00:55,079
Vigor displays are displays that because
 

3365
01:00:55,079 --> 01:00:56,690
Vigor displays are displays that because
they've done them as well in a different

3366
01:00:56,690 --> 01:00:56,700
they've done them as well in a different
 

3367
01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:59,329
they've done them as well in a different
context might not just be displays of

3368
01:00:59,329 --> 01:00:59,339
context might not just be displays of
 

3369
01:00:59,339 --> 01:01:00,950
context might not just be displays of
vigor but might also be an insurance

3370
01:01:00,950 --> 01:01:00,960
vigor but might also be an insurance
 

3371
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:03,069
vigor but might also be an insurance
policy against people seeing weakness

3372
01:01:03,069 --> 01:01:03,079
policy against people seeing weakness
 

3373
01:01:03,079 --> 01:01:06,829
policy against people seeing weakness
okay so now they start using that

3374
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:06,839
okay so now they start using that
 

3375
01:01:06,839 --> 01:01:09,470
okay so now they start using that
prefrontal cortex to do some interesting

3376
01:01:09,470 --> 01:01:09,480
prefrontal cortex to do some interesting
 

3377
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:13,309
prefrontal cortex to do some interesting
things so in in primate world if a male

3378
01:01:13,309 --> 01:01:13,319
things so in in primate world if a male
 

3379
01:01:13,319 --> 01:01:15,170
things so in in primate world if a male
is friendly with another man wants to

3380
01:01:15,170 --> 01:01:15,180
is friendly with another man wants to
 

3381
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:17,990
is friendly with another man wants to
affiliate with him and say hey I'm

3382
01:01:17,990 --> 01:01:18,000
affiliate with him and say hey I'm
 

3383
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,849
affiliate with him and say hey I'm
backing you they'll go over and they'll

3384
01:01:19,849 --> 01:01:19,859
backing you they'll go over and they'll
 

3385
01:01:19,859 --> 01:01:22,250
backing you they'll go over and they'll
they'll pick off the little

3386
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:22,260
they'll pick off the little
 

3387
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:23,870
they'll pick off the little
um parasites and eat them and so the

3388
01:01:23,870 --> 01:01:23,880
um parasites and eat them and so the
 

3389
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:25,490
um parasites and eat them and so the
grooming is extremely important in fact

3390
01:01:25,490 --> 01:01:25,500
grooming is extremely important in fact
 

3391
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:28,609
grooming is extremely important in fact
if they want to ostracize or kill one of

3392
01:01:28,609 --> 01:01:28,619
if they want to ostracize or kill one of
 

3393
01:01:28,619 --> 01:01:30,530
if they want to ostracize or kill one of
the members of their

3394
01:01:30,530 --> 01:01:30,540
the members of their
 

3395
01:01:30,540 --> 01:01:32,329
the members of their
um troop they will just leave it alone

3396
01:01:32,329 --> 01:01:32,339
um troop they will just leave it alone
 

3397
01:01:32,339 --> 01:01:33,829
um troop they will just leave it alone
no one will groom it and then there's

3398
01:01:33,829 --> 01:01:33,839
no one will groom it and then there's
 

3399
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:36,109
no one will groom it and then there's
actually a really disturbing sequence in

3400
01:01:36,109 --> 01:01:36,119
actually a really disturbing sequence in
 

3401
01:01:36,119 --> 01:01:37,910
actually a really disturbing sequence in
that show of then the parasites start to

3402
01:01:37,910 --> 01:01:37,920
that show of then the parasites start to
 

3403
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:38,870
that show of then the parasites start to
eat away on their skin they get

3404
01:01:38,870 --> 01:01:38,880
eat away on their skin they get
 

3405
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:40,609
eat away on their skin they get
infections they have issues no one will

3406
01:01:40,609 --> 01:01:40,619
infections they have issues no one will
 

3407
01:01:40,619 --> 01:01:42,530
infections they have issues no one will
mate with them no one they have other

3408
01:01:42,530 --> 01:01:42,540
mate with them no one they have other
 

3409
01:01:42,540 --> 01:01:44,809
mate with them no one they have other
issues as well and can potentially die

3410
01:01:44,809 --> 01:01:44,819
issues as well and can potentially die
 

3411
01:01:44,819 --> 01:01:46,789
issues as well and can potentially die
so the interesting thing is is number

3412
01:01:46,789 --> 01:01:46,799
so the interesting thing is is number
 

3413
01:01:46,799 --> 01:01:49,309
so the interesting thing is is number
two and three start to line up a

3414
01:01:49,309 --> 01:01:49,319
two and three start to line up a
 

3415
01:01:49,319 --> 01:01:53,530
two and three start to line up a
strategy to groom this guy but

3416
01:01:53,530 --> 01:01:53,540
strategy to groom this guy but
 

3417
01:01:53,540 --> 01:01:55,849
strategy to groom this guy but
they are actually thinking about over

3418
01:01:55,849 --> 01:01:55,859
they are actually thinking about over
 

3419
01:01:55,859 --> 01:01:58,250
they are actually thinking about over
taking the entire troop setting in a new

3420
01:01:58,250 --> 01:01:58,260
taking the entire troop setting in a new
 

3421
01:01:58,260 --> 01:02:00,109
taking the entire troop setting in a new
Alpha but

3422
01:02:00,109 --> 01:02:00,119
Alpha but
 

3423
01:02:00,119 --> 01:02:02,390
Alpha but
the current Alpha did that to get where

3424
01:02:02,390 --> 01:02:02,400
the current Alpha did that to get where
 

3425
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:05,690
the current Alpha did that to get where
he is so he knows that they're doing

3426
01:02:05,690 --> 01:02:05,700
he is so he knows that they're doing
 

3427
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:07,490
he is so he knows that they're doing
this grooming thing but they're not

3428
01:02:07,490 --> 01:02:07,500
this grooming thing but they're not
 

3429
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:09,230
this grooming thing but they're not
might not be sincere about the grooming

3430
01:02:09,230 --> 01:02:09,240
might not be sincere about the grooming
 

3431
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:10,609
might not be sincere about the grooming
so what does he do he takes the whole

3432
01:02:10,609 --> 01:02:10,619
so what does he do he takes the whole
 

3433
01:02:10,619 --> 01:02:12,349
so what does he do he takes the whole
troop on a raid to another troop and

3434
01:02:12,349 --> 01:02:12,359
troop on a raid to another troop and
 

3435
01:02:12,359 --> 01:02:13,789
troop on a raid to another troop and
sees who will fight for him and who

3436
01:02:13,789 --> 01:02:13,799
sees who will fight for him and who
 

3437
01:02:13,799 --> 01:02:16,870
sees who will fight for him and who
won't this is advanced

3438
01:02:16,870 --> 01:02:16,880
won't this is advanced
 

3439
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:19,549
won't this is advanced
Contracting of behavior

3440
01:02:19,549 --> 01:02:19,559
Contracting of behavior
 

3441
01:02:19,559 --> 01:02:22,250
Contracting of behavior
for a species that normally we don't

3442
01:02:22,250 --> 01:02:22,260
for a species that normally we don't
 

3443
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:24,650
for a species that normally we don't
think of as as sophisticated as us so

3444
01:02:24,650 --> 01:02:24,660
think of as as sophisticated as us so
 

3445
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:26,089
think of as as sophisticated as us so
it's very interesting and it gets to

3446
01:02:26,089 --> 01:02:26,099
it's very interesting and it gets to
 

3447
01:02:26,099 --> 01:02:27,410
it's very interesting and it gets to
something that I hope will have an

3448
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:27,420
something that I hope will have an
 

3449
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:28,370
something that I hope will have an
opportunity to talk about because it's

3450
01:02:28,370 --> 01:02:28,380
opportunity to talk about because it's
 

3451
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:29,809
opportunity to talk about because it's
something that I'm obsessed with lately

3452

something that I'm obsessed with lately
is this notion of overt versus covert

3454
01:02:32,150 --> 01:02:32,160
is this notion of overt versus covert

is this notion of overt versus covert
contracts right there are overt

in the sense that they learn that if
 

3483
01:03:07,079 --> 01:03:08,450

3487
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:13,970
back they get food but there's no
um there's no banking of that behavior

3488
01:03:13,970 --> 01:03:13,980
um there's no banking of that behavior
 

3489
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:16,670
um there's no banking of that behavior
for a future date where then they are

3490
01:03:16,670 --> 01:03:16,680
for a future date where then they are
 

3491
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:18,650

going to undermine you and take your

01:03:21,410 --> 01:03:21,420
position okay so in that sense dogs can
 

3495
01:03:21,420 --> 01:03:22,849
position okay so in that sense dogs can
be a little bit manipulative in some

be a little bit manipulative in some
 

3497
01:03:22,859 --> 01:03:24,170
be a little bit manipulative in some
sense but

3498
01:03:24,170 --> 01:03:24,180
sense but
 

3499
01:03:24,180 --> 01:03:27,650
sense but
um now okay so overt contract

3500
01:03:27,650 --> 01:03:27,660
um now okay so overt contract
 

3501

um now okay so overt contract
would be

3502
01:03:29,089 --> 01:03:29,099
would be
 

3503
01:03:29,099 --> 01:03:30,589
would be

covert contract
 

3511
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:41,569
covert contract
which is in my opinion bad always bad

which is in my opinion bad always bad
 

3513
01:03:41,579 --> 01:03:43,370
which is in my opinion bad always bad
would be we're gonna do some work

3521
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:49,069
money
could look just like the overt contract

3522
01:03:49,069 --> 01:03:49,079
could look just like the overt contract
 

3523
01:03:49,079 --> 01:03:52,549
could look just like the overt contract

more sophisticated than a chimpanzee but

more sophisticated than a chimpanzee but
 

3651
01:06:12,599 --> 01:06:15,770
more sophisticated than a chimpanzee but
they do it too and

they do it too and
 

3653
01:06:15,780 --> 01:06:19,250
they do it too and
it's because it's often harder

3654
01:06:19,250 --> 01:06:19,260
it's because it's often harder
 

3655
01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:22,730
it's because it's often harder
to deal with in the short term to deal

to deal with in the short term to deal
 

3657
01:06:22,740 --> 01:06:26,390
to deal with in the short term to deal
with the real sense of this is scary

with the real sense of this is scary

01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,609
with the real sense of this is scary
this feels threatening than it is to

this feels threatening than it is to
 

3661
01:06:28,619 --> 01:06:30,410
this feels threatening than it is to

play out all the iterations it takes a

01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:33,289
play out all the iterations it takes a
lot of brain work you're playing chess

3664
01:06:33,289 --> 01:06:33,299
lot of brain work you're playing chess
 

3665
01:06:33,299 --> 01:06:34,970
lot of brain work you're playing chess
and go simultaneously trying to figure

3666
01:06:34,970 --> 01:06:34,980
and go simultaneously trying to figure
 

3667
01:06:34,980 --> 01:06:36,049
and go simultaneously trying to figure
out where things are going to end up and

3668
01:06:36,049 --> 01:06:36,059
out where things are going to end up and
 

3669
01:06:36,059 --> 01:06:37,970
out where things are going to end up and
we just don't know so it's a way I think

3670
01:06:37,970 --> 01:06:37,980
we just don't know so it's a way I think
 

3671
01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:40,190
we just don't know so it's a way I think
of creating a false sense of certainty

3672
01:06:40,190 --> 01:06:40,200
of creating a false sense of certainty
 

3673
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:43,010
of creating a false sense of certainty
but I'll tell you covert contracts the

3674
01:06:43,010 --> 01:06:43,020
but I'll tell you covert contracts the
 

3675
01:06:43,020 --> 01:06:44,390
but I'll tell you covert contracts the
only certainty is that it's going to end

3676
01:06:44,390 --> 01:06:44,400
only certainty is that it's going to end
 

3677
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:46,069
only certainty is that it's going to end
badly the question is how badly

3678
01:06:46,069 --> 01:06:46,079
badly the question is how badly
 

3679
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:49,670
badly the question is how badly
conversely overt contracts always end

3680
01:06:49,670 --> 01:06:49,680
conversely overt contracts always end
 

3681
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:50,990
conversely overt contracts always end
well

3682
01:06:50,990 --> 01:06:51,000
well
 

3683
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,029
well
always the problem with overt contracts

3684
01:06:53,029 --> 01:06:53,039
always the problem with overt contracts
 

3685
01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:55,730
always the problem with overt contracts
is that you can't be certain that the

3686
01:06:55,730 --> 01:06:55,740
is that you can't be certain that the
 

3687
01:06:55,740 --> 01:06:58,250
is that you can't be certain that the
other person is not engaging in a covert

3688
01:06:58,250 --> 01:06:58,260
other person is not engaging in a covert
 

3689
01:06:58,260 --> 01:06:59,270
other person is not engaging in a covert
contract you can only take

3690
01:06:59,270 --> 01:06:59,280
contract you can only take
 

3691
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:01,370
contract you can only take
responsibility for your own Contracting

3692
01:07:01,370 --> 01:07:01,380
responsibility for your own Contracting
 

3693
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:02,930
responsibility for your own Contracting
well one of the challenges of being

01:07:02,930 --> 01:07:02,940
well one of the challenges of being
 

3695
01:07:02,940 --> 01:07:06,109
well one of the challenges of being
human is looking at another human being

human is looking at another human being
 

3697
01:07:06,119 --> 01:07:08,450
human is looking at another human being
and figuring out

01:07:08,450 --> 01:07:08,460
and figuring out

behavior which of the two types of

01:07:13,140 --> 01:07:15,230
behavior which of the two types of

01:07:15,230 --> 01:07:15,240
contracts it represents because they
 

3705
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:18,589
contracts it represents because they
look awfully the same on the surface and

3706
01:07:18,589 --> 01:07:18,599
look awfully the same on the surface and
 

3707
01:07:18,599 --> 01:07:20,450
look awfully the same on the surface and

it's one of the one of the challenges of
 

3709
01:07:20,460 --> 01:07:22,309
it's one of the one of the challenges of
being human is the decision we all make

3710
01:07:22,309 --> 01:07:22,319
being human is the decision we all make
 

3711
01:07:22,319 --> 01:07:24,710
being human is the decision we all make
is are you somebody that takes a leap of

3712
01:07:24,710 --> 01:07:24,720
is are you somebody that takes a leap of
 

3713
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:26,690
is are you somebody that takes a leap of
trust and trusts other humans that are

trust and trusts other humans that are
 

3715
01:07:26,700 --> 01:07:28,370
trust and trusts other humans that are
willing to take the hurt are you going

3716
01:07:28,370 --> 01:07:28,380
willing to take the hurt are you going
 

3717
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:32,210
willing to take the hurt are you going
to be cynical and skeptical and avoid

3718
01:07:32,210 --> 01:07:32,220
to be cynical and skeptical and avoid

3798
01:09:01,070 --> 01:09:01,080
nights
 

3799
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:03,709
nights
um you know your circadian clock

3800
01:09:03,709 --> 01:09:03,719
um you know your circadian clock
 

3801
01:09:03,719 --> 01:09:06,050
um you know your circadian clock
um is one of the most robust features of

3802
01:09:06,050 --> 01:09:06,060
um is one of the most robust features of
 

3803
01:09:06,060 --> 01:09:08,209
um is one of the most robust features of
your biology I know you can be nocturnal

3804
01:09:08,209 --> 01:09:08,219
your biology I know you can be nocturnal
 

3805
01:09:08,219 --> 01:09:10,370
your biology I know you can be nocturnal
or you can be diurnal we know you're

3806
01:09:10,370 --> 01:09:10,380
or you can be diurnal we know you're
 

3807
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:12,530
or you can be diurnal we know you're
mostly nocturnal um at certain times of

3808
01:09:12,530 --> 01:09:12,540
mostly nocturnal um at certain times of
 

3809
01:09:12,540 --> 01:09:14,090
mostly nocturnal um at certain times of
the year relaxed but

3810
01:09:14,090 --> 01:09:14,100
the year relaxed but
 

3811
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:16,309
the year relaxed but
um but they're very very few people can

3812
01:09:16,309 --> 01:09:16,319
um but they're very very few people can
 

3813
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:18,110
um but they're very very few people can
get away with no sleep very few people

3814
01:09:18,110 --> 01:09:18,120
get away with no sleep very few people
 

3815
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:19,849
get away with no sleep very few people
can get away with a chaotic sleep wake

3816
01:09:19,849 --> 01:09:19,859
can get away with a chaotic sleep wake
 

3817
01:09:19,859 --> 01:09:21,950
can get away with a chaotic sleep wake
schedule so you have to obey a 24-hour

3818
01:09:21,950 --> 01:09:21,960
schedule so you have to obey a 24-hour
 

3819
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:25,430
schedule so you have to obey a 24-hour
AKA circadian uh Rhythm um if you want

3820
01:09:25,430 --> 01:09:25,440
AKA circadian uh Rhythm um if you want
 

3821
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:27,650
AKA circadian uh Rhythm um if you want
to remain healthy of Mind and Body we

3822
01:09:27,650 --> 01:09:27,660
to remain healthy of Mind and Body we
 

3823
01:09:27,660 --> 01:09:30,590
to remain healthy of Mind and Body we
also have to acknowledge that it's

3824
01:09:30,590 --> 01:09:30,600
also have to acknowledge that it's
 

3825
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:32,390
also have to acknowledge that it's
aging is in linear

3826
01:09:32,390 --> 01:09:32,400
aging is in linear
 

3827
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:35,209
aging is in linear
right so um what do you mean well I mean

3828
01:09:35,209 --> 01:09:35,219
right so um what do you mean well I mean
 

3829
01:09:35,219 --> 01:09:38,749
right so um what do you mean well I mean
you the the degree of change between

3830
01:09:38,749 --> 01:09:38,759
you the the degree of change between
 

3831
01:09:38,759 --> 01:09:41,689
you the the degree of change between
years 35 and 40 is not going to be the

3832
01:09:41,689 --> 01:09:41,699
years 35 and 40 is not going to be the
 

3833
01:09:41,699 --> 01:09:44,090
years 35 and 40 is not going to be the
degree of change between 40 and 45 but I

3834
01:09:44,090 --> 01:09:44,100
degree of change between 40 and 45 but I
 

3835
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:45,650
degree of change between 40 and 45 but I
will say this

3836
01:09:45,650 --> 01:09:45,660
will say this
 

3837
01:09:45,660 --> 01:09:48,349
will say this
I'm 48 and I feel better in every aspect

3838
01:09:48,349 --> 01:09:48,359
I'm 48 and I feel better in every aspect
 

3839
01:09:48,359 --> 01:09:50,870
I'm 48 and I feel better in every aspect
of my psychology and biology

3840
01:09:50,870 --> 01:09:50,880
of my psychology and biology
 

3841
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:54,650
of my psychology and biology
now than I did when I was in my 20s

3842
01:09:54,650 --> 01:09:54,660
now than I did when I was in my 20s
 

3843
01:09:54,660 --> 01:10:00,050
now than I did when I was in my 20s
yeah sort of quality of of thought

3844
01:10:00,050 --> 01:10:00,060
yeah sort of quality of of thought
 

3845
01:10:00,060 --> 01:10:02,510
yeah sort of quality of of thought
um time spent

3846
01:10:02,510 --> 01:10:02,520
um time spent
 

3847
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:04,790
um time spent
um physically I can do what I did then

3848
01:10:04,790 --> 01:10:04,800
um physically I can do what I did then
 

3849
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:06,470
um physically I can do what I did then
which is probably says more about what I

3850
01:10:06,470 --> 01:10:06,480
which is probably says more about what I
 

3851
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:08,270
which is probably says more about what I
could do then than what I can do now but

3852
01:10:08,270 --> 01:10:08,280
could do then than what I can do now but
 

3853
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:10,669
could do then than what I can do now but
if you keep training you can continue to

3854
01:10:10,669 --> 01:10:10,679
if you keep training you can continue to
 

3855
01:10:10,679 --> 01:10:12,229
if you keep training you can continue to
get better the key is to not get injured

3856
01:10:12,229 --> 01:10:12,239
get better the key is to not get injured
 

3857
01:10:12,239 --> 01:10:15,290
get better the key is to not get injured
and I I've never trained super hard I've

3858
01:10:15,290 --> 01:10:15,300
and I I've never trained super hard I've
 

3859
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:17,450
and I I've never trained super hard I've
trained hard but I've been cautious to

3860
01:10:17,450 --> 01:10:17,460
trained hard but I've been cautious to
 

3861
01:10:17,460 --> 01:10:18,830
trained hard but I've been cautious to
not for instance weight train more than

3862
01:10:18,830 --> 01:10:18,840
not for instance weight train more than
 

3863
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:20,330
not for instance weight train more than
two days in a row I do a split which

um unless one is power lifting you know
 

3893
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:51,050
um unless one is power lifting you know
weight lifting and running you can get

3894
01:10:51,050 --> 01:10:51,060
weight lifting and running you can get
 

3895
01:10:51,060 --> 01:10:52,729
weight lifting and running you can get
hurt but it's not like skateboarding

getting hurt and frankly now like a
 

3921
01:11:19,620 --> 01:11:21,830
getting hurt and frankly now like a
rolled ankle

3922

3924
01:11:22,669 --> 01:11:22,679
um
 

3925
01:11:22,679 --> 01:11:24,410
um
I may put out a little small skateboard

3928
01:11:26,750 --> 01:11:26,760
part in 2024 because people have been
 

3929
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:28,430
part in 2024 because people have been
saying we want to see the kickflip you

instead but okay

3934
01:11:31,010 --> 01:11:31,020
instead but okay
 

3935
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:32,570
instead but okay
um uh I might put out a little part

3936
01:11:32,570 --> 01:11:32,580
um uh I might put out a little part
 

3937
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:33,470
um uh I might put out a little part
because some of the guys that work on

3938
01:11:33,470 --> 01:11:33,480
because some of the guys that work on
 

3939
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:36,229
because some of the guys that work on
our podcast are from DC I think by now I

3940
01:11:36,229 --> 01:11:36,239
our podcast are from DC I think by now I
 

3941
01:11:36,239 --> 01:11:38,510
our podcast are from DC I think by now I
I I should at least do it just to show

3942
01:11:38,510 --> 01:11:38,520
I I should at least do it just to show
 

3943
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:41,030
I I should at least do it just to show
like I'm not making it up

3944
01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:41,040
like I'm not making it up
 

3945
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:42,770
like I'm not making it up
um and I probably will but I think that

3946
01:11:42,770 --> 01:11:42,780
um and I probably will but I think that
 

3947
01:11:42,780 --> 01:11:44,510
um and I probably will but I think that
doing a sport is different that's how

3948
01:11:44,510 --> 01:11:44,520
doing a sport is different that's how
 

3949
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:45,649
doing a sport is different that's how
you get hurt

3950
01:11:45,649 --> 01:11:45,659
you get hurt
 

3951
01:11:45,659 --> 01:11:48,770
you get hurt
overuse and doing it an actual sport and

3952
01:11:48,770 --> 01:11:48,780
overuse and doing it an actual sport and
 

3953
01:11:48,780 --> 01:11:51,290
overuse and doing it an actual sport and
so you know hat tip to those do an

3954
01:11:51,290 --> 01:11:51,300
so you know hat tip to those do an
 

3955
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:52,970
so you know hat tip to those do an
actual sport

3956
01:11:52,970 --> 01:11:52,980
actual sport
 

3957
01:11:52,980 --> 01:11:55,910
actual sport
and that's a difficult decision like I a

3958
01:11:55,910 --> 01:11:55,920
and that's a difficult decision like I a
 

3959
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:56,990
and that's a difficult decision like I a
lot of people have to make I have to

3960
01:11:56,990 --> 01:11:57,000
lot of people have to make I have to
 

3961
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,149
lot of people have to make I have to
make with Jiu Jitsu for example like if

3962
01:11:59,149 --> 01:11:59,159
make with Jiu Jitsu for example like if
 

3963
01:11:59,159 --> 01:12:01,130
make with Jiu Jitsu for example like if
you just look empirically I've trained

3964
01:12:01,130 --> 01:12:01,140
you just look empirically I've trained
 

3965
01:12:01,140 --> 01:12:02,689
you just look empirically I've trained
really hard from all my life and

3966
01:12:02,689 --> 01:12:02,699
really hard from all my life and
 

3967
01:12:02,699 --> 01:12:04,430
really hard from all my life and
grappling Sports and fighting Sports and

3968
01:12:04,430 --> 01:12:04,440
grappling Sports and fighting Sports and
 

3969
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:06,649
grappling Sports and fighting Sports and
all this kind of stuff and I've avoided

3970
01:12:06,649 --> 01:12:06,659
all this kind of stuff and I've avoided
 

3971
01:12:06,659 --> 01:12:10,070
all this kind of stuff and I've avoided
injury for the most part and I would say

3972
01:12:10,070 --> 01:12:10,080
injury for the most part and I would say
 

3973
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:12,470
injury for the most part and I would say
I would attribute that to

3974
01:12:12,470 --> 01:12:12,480
I would attribute that to
 

3975
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:14,750
I would attribute that to
um training a lot sounds

3976
01:12:14,750 --> 01:12:14,760
um training a lot sounds
 

3977
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:17,330
um training a lot sounds
counterintuitive but training well and

3978
01:12:17,330 --> 01:12:17,340
counterintuitive but training well and
 

3979
01:12:17,340 --> 01:12:20,149
counterintuitive but training well and
safely and correctly keeping good form

3980
01:12:20,149 --> 01:12:20,159
safely and correctly keeping good form
 

3981
01:12:20,159 --> 01:12:22,610
safely and correctly keeping good form
saying no and I need to say no but

3982
01:12:22,610 --> 01:12:22,620
saying no and I need to say no but
 

3983
01:12:22,620 --> 01:12:24,709
saying no and I need to say no but
training a lot and taking it seriously

3984
01:12:24,709 --> 01:12:24,719
training a lot and taking it seriously
 

3985
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:28,070
training a lot and taking it seriously
now when this training is kind of a side

3986
01:12:28,070 --> 01:12:28,080
now when this training is kind of a side
 

3987
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:30,530
now when this training is kind of a side
really a side thing I find that the

3988
01:12:30,530 --> 01:12:30,540
really a side thing I find that the
 

3989
01:12:30,540 --> 01:12:33,649
really a side thing I find that the
injury is uh becomes a higher and higher

3990
01:12:33,649 --> 01:12:33,659
injury is uh becomes a higher and higher
 

3991
01:12:33,659 --> 01:12:35,330
injury is uh becomes a higher and higher
probability when you're just doing it

3992
01:12:35,330 --> 01:12:35,340
probability when you're just doing it
 

3993
01:12:35,340 --> 01:12:36,770
probability when you're just doing it
every once in a while every once in a

3994
01:12:36,770 --> 01:12:36,780
every once in a while every once in a
 

3995
01:12:36,780 --> 01:12:38,390
every once in a while every once in a
while yeah that I think you said

3996
01:12:38,390 --> 01:12:38,400
while yeah that I think you said
 

3997
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:40,430
while yeah that I think you said
something really important that the um

3998
01:12:40,430 --> 01:12:40,440
something really important that the um
 

3999
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:43,070
something really important that the um
saying no I mean the times I have gotten

4000
01:12:43,070 --> 01:12:43,080
saying no I mean the times I have gotten

Hospital's worth of splints yeah I'm
trying I'm trying to figure out so

4056
01:13:42,830 --> 01:13:42,840
trying I'm trying to figure out so
 

4057
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:45,350
trying I'm trying to figure out so
here's the thing you uh I think like pop

4058
01:13:45,350 --> 01:13:45,360
here's the thing you uh I think like pop

trying to figure out how do I splint in
such a way that I can still program

4064
01:13:51,709 --> 01:13:51,719
such a way that I can still program
 

4065
01:13:51,719 --> 01:13:53,450
such a way that I can still program
still play guitar

but protect this kind of torque motion

4068
01:13:56,149 --> 01:13:56,159
but protect this kind of torque motion
 

4069
01:13:56,159 --> 01:13:58,430
but protect this kind of torque motion
that creates a huge amount of pain and

4070
01:13:58,430 --> 01:13:58,440
that creates a huge amount of pain and
 

4071
01:13:58,440 --> 01:13:59,689
that creates a huge amount of pain and
that's a bit of a jiu jitsu injury

4072
01:13:59,689 --> 01:13:59,699
that's a bit of a jiu jitsu injury
 

4073
01:13:59,699 --> 01:14:02,090
that's a bit of a jiu jitsu injury
Jiu-Jitsu but it's a it's not the kind

4074
01:14:02,090 --> 01:14:02,100

the Gulf down here weren't available to
 

4453
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:13,250
the Gulf down here weren't available to
us so we had to get different shrimp and

4454
01:21:13,250 --> 01:21:13,260
us so we had to get different shrimp and
 

4455
01:21:13,260 --> 01:21:15,169
us so we had to get different shrimp and
what we noticed was the the Cuttlefish

4456
01:21:15,169 --> 01:21:15,179
what we noticed was the the Cuttlefish
 

4457
01:21:15,179 --> 01:21:18,110
what we noticed was the the Cuttlefish
normally would just sneak up on the

01:21:22,010 --> 01:21:22,020
collection and if the shrimp was facing
 

4463
01:21:22,020 --> 01:21:23,870
collection and if the shrimp was facing
them they would do this thing with their

4464
01:21:23,870 --> 01:21:23,880
them they would do this thing with their
 

4465
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:25,490
them they would do this thing with their
tentacles of kind of enchanting the

4466
01:21:25,490 --> 01:21:25,500
tentacles of kind of enchanting the
 

4467
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:28,729
tentacles of kind of enchanting the
cuddle the the shrimp and if the shrimp

4468
01:21:28,729 --> 01:21:28,739
cuddle the the shrimp and if the shrimp
 

4469
01:21:28,739 --> 01:21:30,169
cuddle the the shrimp and if the shrimp
wasn't facing them they wouldn't do it

4470
01:21:30,169 --> 01:21:30,179
wasn't facing them they wouldn't do it
 

4471
01:21:30,179 --> 01:21:31,850
wasn't facing them they wouldn't do it
and they would ballistically grab it and

4472
01:21:31,850 --> 01:21:31,860
and they would ballistically grab it and
 

4473
01:21:31,860 --> 01:21:33,290
and they would ballistically grab it and
and eat them

4474
01:21:33,290 --> 01:21:33,300
and eat them
 

4475
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:35,570
and eat them
well when we got these new shrimp the

4476
01:21:35,570 --> 01:21:35,580
well when we got these new shrimp the
 

4477
01:21:35,580 --> 01:21:38,270
well when we got these new shrimp the
new shrimp had eye spots on their tails

4478
01:21:38,270 --> 01:21:38,280
new shrimp had eye spots on their tails
 

4479
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:40,430
new shrimp had eye spots on their tails
and then the Cuttlefish would do this

4480
01:21:40,430 --> 01:21:40,440
and then the Cuttlefish would do this
 

4481
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:42,229
and then the Cuttlefish would do this
kind of attempt to enchant regardless of

01:21:42,229 --> 01:21:42,239
kind of attempt to enchant regardless of
 

4483
01:21:42,239 --> 01:21:44,149
kind of attempt to enchant regardless of
the position of the ghost shrimp so what

4484
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:44,159
the position of the ghost shrimp so what
 

4485
01:21:44,159 --> 01:21:45,350
the position of the ghost shrimp so what
does that mean okay well it means that

4486
01:21:45,350 --> 01:21:45,360
does that mean okay well it means that
 

4487
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:46,970
does that mean okay well it means that
there's some sort of algorithm in the

4488
01:21:46,970 --> 01:21:46,980
there's some sort of algorithm in the
 

4489
01:21:46,980 --> 01:21:50,390
there's some sort of algorithm in the
cuttlefish's mind that says okay if you

4490
01:21:50,390 --> 01:21:50,400
cuttlefish's mind that says okay if you
 

4491
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:53,330
cuttlefish's mind that says okay if you
see two spots move your tentacles so it

4492
01:21:53,330 --> 01:21:53,340
see two spots move your tentacles so it
 

4493
01:21:53,340 --> 01:21:55,010
see two spots move your tentacles so it
can be as you pointed out it can be a

4494
01:21:55,010 --> 01:21:55,020
can be as you pointed out it can be a
 

4495
01:21:55,020 --> 01:21:57,470
can be as you pointed out it can be a
fairly simple operation but it looks

4496
01:21:57,470 --> 01:21:57,480
fairly simple operation but it looks
 

4497
01:21:57,480 --> 01:22:00,590
fairly simple operation but it looks
diabolical it looks cunning but all it

4498
01:22:00,590 --> 01:22:00,600
diabolical it looks cunning but all it
 

4499
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:03,229
diabolical it looks cunning but all it
is is strategy B

is is strategy B
yeah but it's still somehow

4502
01:22:07,090 --> 01:22:07,100
yeah but it's still somehow

01:22:07,100 --> 01:22:10,550
yeah but it's still somehow
emerged I mean I I I don't think that

01:22:10,550 --> 01:22:10,560
emerged I mean I I I don't think that
 

4505
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:11,990

it's like calling it an algorithm
 

4507
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,209
it's like calling it an algorithm
doesn't I feel like well there's a

4508
01:22:14,209 --> 01:22:14,219
doesn't I feel like well there's a
 

4509
01:22:14,219 --> 01:22:16,189
doesn't I feel like well there's a
circuit there that gets implemented in a

often understand about genetics is that

often understand about genetics is that
 

4641
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:39,590
often understand about genetics is that
it only takes a few generations to

it only takes a few generations to
 

4643
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:42,770
it only takes a few generations to
devolve a trait make it worse but it

4644
01:24:42,770 --> 01:24:42,780
devolve a trait make it worse but it
 

4645
01:24:42,780 --> 01:24:45,470
devolve a trait make it worse but it
takes a long time to evolve an Adaptive

takes a long time to evolve an Adaptive
trait there are exceptions to that but

4648
01:24:48,590 --> 01:24:48,600
trait there are exceptions to that but
 

4649
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:51,229
trait there are exceptions to that but
most often that's true so a species

4650
01:24:51,229 --> 01:24:51,239
most often that's true so a species
 

4651
01:24:51,239 --> 01:24:52,910
most often that's true so a species
needs a lot of generations we are

needs a lot of generations we are
 

4653
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:54,830

hopefully still evolving as a species

01:24:54,830 --> 01:24:54,840
hopefully still evolving as a species

hopefully still evolving as a species
and it takes a long time but uh to

4656
01:24:58,490 --> 01:24:58,500
and it takes a long time but uh to
 

4657
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:00,830
and it takes a long time but uh to
evolve more adaptive traits but doesn't

4658
01:25:00,830 --> 01:25:00,840
evolve more adaptive traits but doesn't
 

4659
01:25:00,840 --> 01:25:03,229
evolve more adaptive traits but doesn't
take long to to devolve

4660
01:25:03,229 --> 01:25:03,239
take long to to devolve
 

4661
01:25:03,239 --> 01:25:05,450
take long to to devolve
adaptive traits so that you're getting

4662
01:25:05,450 --> 01:25:05,460
adaptive traits so that you're getting
 

4663
01:25:05,460 --> 01:25:07,250
adaptive traits so that you're getting
sicker or you're not functioning as well

01:25:07,250 --> 01:25:07,260
sicker or you're not functioning as well
 

4665
01:25:07,260 --> 01:25:09,709
sicker or you're not functioning as well
so choose your mate wisely and that's

4666
01:25:09,709 --> 01:25:09,719
so choose your mate wisely and that's
 

4667
01:25:09,719 --> 01:25:11,330
so choose your mate wisely and that's
perhaps a good segue into sexual

4668
01:25:11,330 --> 01:25:11,340
perhaps a good segue into sexual
 

4669
01:25:11,340 --> 01:25:13,370
perhaps a good segue into sexual
selection humans I could tell you you're

4671
01:25:13,380 --> 01:25:14,470

uh who said well why did I bring up

4674
01:25:16,970 --> 01:25:16,980
uh who said well why did I bring up
 

4675
01:25:16,980 --> 01:25:18,470

sexual selection it's good relationship

sexual selection it's good relationship
 

4677
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:20,689
sexual selection it's good relationship
so um it's extra selection in humans

4678
01:25:20,689 --> 01:25:20,699
so um it's extra selection in humans

01:29:11,890 --> 01:29:11,900
acceptance
 

4865
01:29:11,900 --> 01:29:14,510
acceptance
a real

4866
01:29:14,510 --> 01:29:14,520
a real
 

4867
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:16,370
a real
maybe even admiration but certainly

4868
01:29:16,370 --> 01:29:16,380
maybe even admiration but certainly
 

4869
01:29:16,380 --> 01:29:18,649
maybe even admiration but certainly
Delight in being with the person you

4870
01:29:18,649 --> 01:29:18,659
Delight in being with the person you
 

4871
01:29:18,659 --> 01:29:19,970
Delight in being with the person you
know earlier we were talking about peace

4872
01:29:19,970 --> 01:29:19,980
know earlier we were talking about peace
 

4873
01:29:19,980 --> 01:29:21,950
know earlier we were talking about peace
and I think that that sense of Peace

4874
01:29:21,950 --> 01:29:21,960
and I think that that sense of Peace
 

4875
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:23,629
and I think that that sense of Peace
comes from knowing that the person

4876
01:29:23,629 --> 01:29:23,639
comes from knowing that the person
 

4877
01:29:23,639 --> 01:29:24,950
comes from knowing that the person
you're in friendship with or that you're

4878
01:29:24,950 --> 01:29:24,960
you're in friendship with or that you're
 

4879
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:27,470
you're in friendship with or that you're
in romantic relationship or ideally both

4880
01:29:27,470 --> 01:29:27,480
in romantic relationship or ideally both
 

4881
01:29:27,480 --> 01:29:28,790
in romantic relationship or ideally both
because let's assume healthy relation

4882
01:29:28,790 --> 01:29:28,800
because let's assume healthy relation
 

4883
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:30,530
because let's assume healthy relation
the best romantic relationship includes

4884
01:29:30,530 --> 01:29:30,540
the best romantic relationship includes
 

4885
01:29:30,540 --> 01:29:31,790
the best romantic relationship includes
a friendship component with that person

4886
01:29:31,790 --> 01:29:31,800
a friendship component with that person
 

4887
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:34,430
a friendship component with that person
it's like you just freely Delight in

4888
01:29:34,430 --> 01:29:34,440
it's like you just freely Delight in
 

4889
01:29:34,440 --> 01:29:36,229
it's like you just freely Delight in
their presence even if it's a quiet

4890
01:29:36,229 --> 01:29:36,239
their presence even if it's a quiet
 

4891
01:29:36,239 --> 01:29:37,850
their presence even if it's a quiet
presence

4892
01:29:37,850 --> 01:29:37,860
presence
 

4893
01:29:37,860 --> 01:29:38,590
presence
um

4894
01:29:38,590 --> 01:29:38,600
um
 

4895
01:29:38,600 --> 01:29:42,169
um
and you Delight in seeing them Delight

4896
01:29:42,169 --> 01:29:42,179
and you Delight in seeing them Delight
 

4897
01:29:42,179 --> 01:29:44,090
and you Delight in seeing them Delight
in things right

4898
01:29:44,090 --> 01:29:44,100
in things right
 

4899
01:29:44,100 --> 01:29:47,209
in things right
um that's clear uh the trust piece is

4900
01:29:47,209 --> 01:29:47,219
um that's clear uh the trust piece is
 

4901
01:29:47,219 --> 01:29:48,649
um that's clear uh the trust piece is
huge

4902
01:29:48,649 --> 01:29:48,659
huge
 

4903
01:29:48,659 --> 01:29:50,209
huge
um you know and and that's where people

4904
01:29:50,209 --> 01:29:50,219
um you know and and that's where people
 

4905
01:29:50,219 --> 01:29:52,189
um you know and and that's where people
start I you know we don't want to focus

4906
01:29:52,189 --> 01:29:52,199
start I you know we don't want to focus
 

4907
01:29:52,199 --> 01:29:53,570
start I you know we don't want to focus
on what works not what doesn't work but

4908
01:29:53,570 --> 01:29:53,580
on what works not what doesn't work but
 

4909
01:29:53,580 --> 01:29:55,970
on what works not what doesn't work but
that's where I think people

4910
01:29:55,970 --> 01:29:55,980
that's where I think people
 

4911
01:29:55,980 --> 01:29:58,189
that's where I think people
start engaging these covert contracts

4912
01:29:58,189 --> 01:29:58,199
start engaging these covert contracts
 

4913
01:29:58,199 --> 01:30:00,470
start engaging these covert contracts
they're afraid of being betrayed so they

4914
01:30:00,470 --> 01:30:00,480
they're afraid of being betrayed so they
 

4915
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:01,570
they're afraid of being betrayed so they
betray

4916
01:30:01,570 --> 01:30:01,580
betray
 

4917
01:30:01,580 --> 01:30:04,610
betray
they're afraid of giving up too much

4918
01:30:04,610 --> 01:30:04,620
they're afraid of giving up too much
 

4919
01:30:04,620 --> 01:30:06,890
they're afraid of giving up too much
vulnerability so they hide their

4920
01:30:06,890 --> 01:30:06,900
vulnerability so they hide their
 

4921
01:30:06,900 --> 01:30:09,530
vulnerability so they hide their
vulnerability or in the worst cases they

4922
01:30:09,530 --> 01:30:09,540
vulnerability or in the worst cases they
 

4923
01:30:09,540 --> 01:30:12,229
vulnerability or in the worst cases they
feign vulnerability

4924
01:30:12,229 --> 01:30:12,239
feign vulnerability
 

4925
01:30:12,239 --> 01:30:14,750
feign vulnerability
um again that's a covert contract that

4926
01:30:14,750 --> 01:30:14,760
um again that's a covert contract that
 

4927
01:30:14,760 --> 01:30:16,189
um again that's a covert contract that
just simply undermines everything it

4928
01:30:16,189 --> 01:30:16,199
just simply undermines everything it
 

4929
01:30:16,199 --> 01:30:18,110
just simply undermines everything it
becomes one equals two minus one to

4930
01:30:18,110 --> 01:30:18,120
becomes one equals two minus one to
 

4931
01:30:18,120 --> 01:30:19,790
becomes one equals two minus one to
Infinity

4932
01:30:19,790 --> 01:30:19,800
Infinity
 

4933
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:22,610
Infinity
conversely I think if people can have

4934
01:30:22,610 --> 01:30:22,620
conversely I think if people can have
 

4935
01:30:22,620 --> 01:30:24,890
conversely I think if people can have
really hard conversations this is

4936
01:30:24,890 --> 01:30:24,900
really hard conversations this is
 

4937
01:30:24,900 --> 01:30:26,030
really hard conversations this is
something I've had to work really hard

4938
01:30:26,030 --> 01:30:26,040
something I've had to work really hard
 

4939
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:27,350
something I've had to work really hard
on in recent years that I'm still

4940
01:30:27,350 --> 01:30:27,360
on in recent years that I'm still
 

4941
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:30,470
on in recent years that I'm still
working hard on but the Friendship piece

4942
01:30:30,470 --> 01:30:30,480
working hard on but the Friendship piece
 

4943
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:32,750
working hard on but the Friendship piece
seems to be the thing that rises to the

4944
01:30:32,750 --> 01:30:32,760
seems to be the thing that rises to the
 

4945
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:35,390
seems to be the thing that rises to the
top when I talk to friends who are in

4946
01:30:35,390 --> 01:30:35,400
top when I talk to friends who are in
 

4947
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:37,850
top when I talk to friends who are in
these great relationships it's like they

4948
01:30:37,850 --> 01:30:37,860
these great relationships it's like they
 

4949
01:30:37,860 --> 01:30:41,510
these great relationships it's like they
they have so much respect and love and

4950
01:30:41,510 --> 01:30:41,520
they have so much respect and love and
 

4951
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:44,209
they have so much respect and love and
joy in being with their friend is the

4952
01:30:44,209 --> 01:30:44,219
joy in being with their friend is the
 

4953
01:30:44,219 --> 01:30:45,590
joy in being with their friend is the
person that they want to spend as much

4954
01:30:45,590 --> 01:30:45,600
person that they want to spend as much
 

4955
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:47,689
person that they want to spend as much
of their non-working non

4956
01:30:47,689 --> 01:30:47,699
of their non-working non
 

4957
01:30:47,699 --> 01:30:50,570
of their non-working non
uh platonic friendship time with and the

4958
01:30:50,570 --> 01:30:50,580
uh platonic friendship time with and the
 

4959
01:30:50,580 --> 01:30:51,830
uh platonic friendship time with and the
person they want to experience things

4960
01:30:51,830 --> 01:30:51,840
person they want to experience things
 

4961
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:53,810
person they want to experience things
with and share things with and

4962
01:30:53,810 --> 01:30:53,820
with and share things with and
 

4963
01:30:53,820 --> 01:30:56,450
with and share things with and
um and it sounds so kind of canned and

4964
01:30:56,450 --> 01:30:56,460
um and it sounds so kind of canned and
 

4965
01:30:56,460 --> 01:30:59,030
um and it sounds so kind of canned and
cliche nowadays but I think if you step

4966
01:30:59,030 --> 01:30:59,040
cliche nowadays but I think if you step
 

4967
01:30:59,040 --> 01:31:00,470
cliche nowadays but I think if you step
back and examine how most people go

4968
01:31:00,470 --> 01:31:00,480
back and examine how most people go
 

4969
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:02,450
back and examine how most people go
about finding a relationship so I'm like

4970
01:31:02,450 --> 01:31:02,460
about finding a relationship so I'm like
 

4971
01:31:02,460 --> 01:31:03,950
about finding a relationship so I'm like
oh like am I attracted of course

4972
01:31:03,950 --> 01:31:03,960
oh like am I attracted of course
 

4973
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:05,750
oh like am I attracted of course
physical attraction is important in

4974
01:31:05,750 --> 01:31:05,760
physical attraction is important in
 

4975
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:08,810
physical attraction is important in
other forms of Attraction too and they

4976
01:31:08,810 --> 01:31:08,820
other forms of Attraction too and they
 

4977
01:31:08,820 --> 01:31:10,610
other forms of Attraction too and they
sort of enter through that portal which

4978
01:31:10,610 --> 01:31:10,620
sort of enter through that portal which
 

4979
01:31:10,620 --> 01:31:12,530
sort of enter through that portal which
makes sense that's that's the mating

4980
01:31:12,530 --> 01:31:12,540
makes sense that's that's the mating
 

4981
01:31:12,540 --> 01:31:15,050
makes sense that's that's the mating
dance right that's the peacock situation

4982
01:31:15,050 --> 01:31:15,060
dance right that's the peacock situation
 

4983
01:31:15,060 --> 01:31:17,030
dance right that's the peacock situation
that's hopefully not the Cuttlefish

4984
01:31:17,030 --> 01:31:17,040
that's hopefully not the Cuttlefish
 

4985
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:19,129
that's hopefully not the Cuttlefish
situation

4986
01:31:19,129 --> 01:31:19,139
situation
 

4987
01:31:19,139 --> 01:31:22,370
situation
um but but I think that

4988
01:31:22,370 --> 01:31:22,380
um but but I think that
 

4989
01:31:22,380 --> 01:31:24,530
um but but I think that
um there seems to be

4990
01:31:24,530 --> 01:31:24,540
um there seems to be
 

4991
01:31:24,540 --> 01:31:27,470
um there seems to be
a history of people close to me getting

4992
01:31:27,470 --> 01:31:27,480
a history of people close to me getting
 

4993
01:31:27,480 --> 01:31:29,330
a history of people close to me getting
into great relationships where they were

4994
01:31:29,330 --> 01:31:29,340
into great relationships where they were
 

4995
01:31:29,340 --> 01:31:31,129
into great relationships where they were
friends for a while first or maybe

4996
01:31:31,129 --> 01:31:31,139
friends for a while first or maybe
 

4997
01:31:31,139 --> 01:31:33,470
friends for a while first or maybe
didn't sleep together right away yeah

4998
01:31:33,470 --> 01:31:33,480
didn't sleep together right away yeah
 

4999
01:31:33,480 --> 01:31:35,149
didn't sleep together right away yeah
that they actually intentionally

5000
01:31:35,149 --> 01:31:35,159
that they actually intentionally
 

5001
01:31:35,159 --> 01:31:37,370
that they actually intentionally
deferred on that

5002
01:31:37,370 --> 01:31:37,380
deferred on that
 

5003
01:31:37,380 --> 01:31:39,350
deferred on that
um this has not been

5004
01:31:39,350 --> 01:31:39,360
um this has not been
 

5005
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:41,270
um this has not been
my habit or my experience you know I've

5006
01:31:41,270 --> 01:31:41,280
my habit or my experience you know I've
 

5007
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:42,350
my habit or my experience you know I've
gone to more

5008
01:31:42,350 --> 01:31:42,360
gone to more
 

5009
01:31:42,360 --> 01:31:44,930
gone to more
um I think typical like oh there's an

5010
01:31:44,930 --> 01:31:44,940
um I think typical like oh there's an
 

5011
01:31:44,940 --> 01:31:46,669
um I think typical like oh there's an
attraction like this person there's an

5012
01:31:46,669 --> 01:31:46,679
attraction like this person there's an
 

5013
01:31:46,679 --> 01:31:47,810
attraction like this person there's an
interest you kind of explore all

5014
01:31:47,810 --> 01:31:47,820
interest you kind of explore all
 

5015
01:31:47,820 --> 01:31:49,189
interest you kind of explore all
dimensions of relationship really

5016
01:31:49,189 --> 01:31:49,199
dimensions of relationship really
 

5017
01:31:49,199 --> 01:31:50,689
dimensions of relationship really
quickly except perhaps the moving in

5018
01:31:50,689 --> 01:31:50,699
quickly except perhaps the moving in
 

5019
01:31:50,699 --> 01:31:52,610
quickly except perhaps the moving in
part and having kids part

5020
01:31:52,610 --> 01:31:52,620
part and having kids part
 

5021
01:31:52,620 --> 01:31:54,229
part and having kids part
um which ideally because it's a bigger

5022
01:31:54,229 --> 01:31:54,239
um which ideally because it's a bigger
 

5023
01:31:54,239 --> 01:31:57,169
um which ideally because it's a bigger
step harder to undo without more severe

5024
01:31:57,169 --> 01:31:57,179
step harder to undo without more severe
 

5025
01:31:57,179 --> 01:31:58,250
step harder to undo without more severe
consequences

5026
01:31:58,250 --> 01:31:58,260
consequences
 

5027
01:31:58,260 --> 01:31:59,629
consequences
but I think

5028
01:31:59,629 --> 01:31:59,639
but I think
 

5029
01:31:59,639 --> 01:32:02,629
but I think
the whole take it slow thing

5030
01:32:02,629 --> 01:32:02,639
the whole take it slow thing
 

5031
01:32:02,639 --> 01:32:04,129
the whole take it slow thing
um I don't think is about getting to

5032
01:32:04,129 --> 01:32:04,139
um I don't think is about getting to
 

5033
01:32:04,139 --> 01:32:05,750
um I don't think is about getting to
know someone slowly I think it's about

5034
01:32:05,750 --> 01:32:05,760
know someone slowly I think it's about
 

5035
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:08,209
know someone slowly I think it's about
that physical piece because that does

5036
01:32:08,209 --> 01:32:08,219
that physical piece because that does
 

5037
01:32:08,219 --> 01:32:09,729
that physical piece because that does
change the nature of the relationship

5038
01:32:09,729 --> 01:32:09,739
change the nature of the relationship
 

5039
01:32:09,739 --> 01:32:12,470
change the nature of the relationship
and I think it's because it gets right

5040
01:32:12,470 --> 01:32:12,480
and I think it's because it gets right
 

5041
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:15,350
and I think it's because it gets right
into the more hardwired primitive

5042
01:32:15,350 --> 01:32:15,360
into the more hardwired primitive

01:32:17,580 --> 01:32:20,209
circuitry around our feelings of of
safety vulnerability

5046
01:32:20,209 --> 01:32:20,219
safety vulnerability
 

5047
01:32:20,219 --> 01:32:23,990
safety vulnerability
um you know there's something about

5048
01:32:23,990 --> 01:32:24,000

where it's almost like
it's like assets and liabilities right

5054
01:32:31,250 --> 01:32:31,260
it's like assets and liabilities right
 

5055
01:32:31,260 --> 01:32:32,870
it's like assets and liabilities right
where people are trying to figure out

5056
01:32:32,870 --> 01:32:32,880
where people are trying to figure out
 

5057
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:36,050
where people are trying to figure out
how much to engage their time and their

energy and multiple people I'm talking

5060
01:32:37,310 --> 01:32:37,320
energy and multiple people I'm talking
 

5061
01:32:37,320 --> 01:32:38,810
energy and multiple people I'm talking
about from both sides you know male

5062
01:32:38,810 --> 01:32:38,820
about from both sides you know male
 

5063
01:32:38,820 --> 01:32:41,930
about from both sides you know male
female or whatever it decides but where

5064
01:32:41,930 --> 01:32:41,940
female or whatever it decides but where
 

5065
01:32:41,940 --> 01:32:43,970
female or whatever it decides but where
it's like assets and liabilities and and

5066
01:32:43,970 --> 01:32:43,980
it's like assets and liabilities and and
 

5067
01:32:43,980 --> 01:32:46,550
it's like assets and liabilities and and
that that's where it starts getting I um

5068
01:32:46,550 --> 01:32:46,560
that that's where it starts getting I um
 

5069
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:48,410
that that's where it starts getting I um
into those

5070
01:32:48,410 --> 01:32:48,420
into those
 

5071
01:32:48,420 --> 01:32:50,510
into those
complicated contracts early on I think

5072
01:32:50,510 --> 01:32:50,520
complicated contracts early on I think
 

5073
01:32:50,520 --> 01:32:52,430
complicated contracts early on I think
and so maybe that's why if a really

5074
01:32:52,430 --> 01:32:52,440
and so maybe that's why if a really
 

5075
01:32:52,440 --> 01:32:54,709
and so maybe that's why if a really
great friendship and admiration is is

5076
01:32:54,709 --> 01:32:54,719
great friendship and admiration is is
 

5077
01:32:54,719 --> 01:32:56,330
great friendship and admiration is is
established first

5078
01:32:56,330 --> 01:32:56,340
established first
 

5079
01:32:56,340 --> 01:32:58,129
established first
even if people are romantically and

5080
01:32:58,129 --> 01:32:58,139
even if people are romantically and
 

5081
01:32:58,139 --> 01:32:59,570
even if people are romantically and
sexually attracted to one another then

5082
01:32:59,570 --> 01:32:59,580
sexually attracted to one another then
 

5083
01:32:59,580 --> 01:33:01,189
sexually attracted to one another then
that piece can be added in a little bit

5084
01:33:01,189 --> 01:33:01,199
that piece can be added in a little bit
 

5085
01:33:01,199 --> 01:33:03,590
that piece can be added in a little bit
later in a way that

5086
01:33:03,590 --> 01:33:03,600
later in a way that
 

5087
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:05,390
later in a way that
really kind of just seals up the whole

5088
01:33:05,390 --> 01:33:05,400
really kind of just seals up the whole
 

5089
01:33:05,400 --> 01:33:06,410
really kind of just seals up the whole
thing and then who knows maybe they

5090
01:33:06,410 --> 01:33:06,420
thing and then who knows maybe they
 

5091
01:33:06,420 --> 01:33:08,330
thing and then who knows maybe they
spend 90 of their time having sex I

5092
01:33:08,330 --> 01:33:08,340
spend 90 of their time having sex I
 

5093
01:33:08,340 --> 01:33:09,470
spend 90 of their time having sex I
don't know

don't know
um that that's not for me to say or or

5096
01:33:12,050 --> 01:33:12,060

5097
01:33:12,060 --> 01:33:14,870
um that that's not for me to say or or
decide obviously but there's something

5098
01:33:14,870 --> 01:33:14,880
decide obviously but there's something
 

5099
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:16,850
decide obviously but there's something
there about

5100
01:33:16,850 --> 01:33:16,860
there about
 

5101
01:33:16,860 --> 01:33:21,830
there about
staying out of a certain amount of um

5102
01:33:21,830 --> 01:33:21,840
staying out of a certain amount of um
 

5103
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:26,209
staying out of a certain amount of um
uh risk of having to engage covert

5104
01:33:26,209 --> 01:33:26,219
uh risk of having to engage covert
 

5105
01:33:26,219 --> 01:33:28,910
uh risk of having to engage covert
contract in order to protect oneself

and I did a uh four and a half hour

5396
01:38:43,910 --> 01:38:43,920
and I did a uh four and a half hour
 

5397
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:45,590
and I did a uh four and a half hour
episode on fertility and the reason I

5398
01:38:45,590 --> 01:38:45,600
episode on fertility and the reason I
 

5399
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:47,090
episode on fertility and the reason I
did a four and a half hour episode of

did a four and a half hour episode of
 

5401
01:38:47,100 --> 01:38:49,250
did a four and a half hour episode of
fertility is that first of all I find

5402
01:38:49,250 --> 01:38:49,260
fertility is that first of all I find
 

5403
01:38:49,260 --> 01:38:51,530
fertility is that first of all I find
that the reproductive biology be

5404
01:38:51,530 --> 01:38:51,540
that the reproductive biology be
 

5405
01:38:51,540 --> 01:38:53,870
that the reproductive biology be
fascinating and I wanted a resource for

5406
01:38:53,870 --> 01:38:53,880
fascinating and I wanted a resource for
 

5407
01:38:53,880 --> 01:38:55,430
fascinating and I wanted a resource for
people that

5408
01:38:55,430 --> 01:38:55,440
people that
 

5409
01:38:55,440 --> 01:38:58,490
people that
um were thinking about or struggling

5410
01:38:58,490 --> 01:38:58,500
um were thinking about or struggling
 

5411

with having kids uh for whatever reason
 

5413
01:39:01,560 --> 01:39:02,629
with having kids uh for whatever reason
um and it felt important to me to

5414
01:39:02,629 --> 01:39:02,639
um and it felt important to me to
 

5415
01:39:02,639 --> 01:39:04,490
um and it felt important to me to
combine the male and female components

5416
01:39:04,490 --> 01:39:04,500
combine the male and female components
 

5417
01:39:04,500 --> 01:39:05,870
combine the male and female components
in the same episode it's all time

01:39:10,610 --> 01:39:10,620
and virtual fertilization we talk about
 

5425
01:39:10,620 --> 01:39:14,090
and virtual fertilization we talk about
natural pregnancy okay the data on

5426
01:39:14,090 --> 01:39:14,100
natural pregnancy okay the data on
 

5427
01:39:14,100 --> 01:39:16,490
natural pregnancy okay the data on
position is very interesting but let me

5428
01:39:16,490 --> 01:39:16,500
position is very interesting but let me
 

5429
01:39:16,500 --> 01:39:18,050
position is very interesting but let me
just say a few things there are a few

5430
01:39:18,050 --> 01:39:18,060
just say a few things there are a few
 

5431
01:39:18,060 --> 01:39:20,090
just say a few things there are a few
clinics now in particular some out of

the United States that are spinning down
 

5435
01:39:23,340 --> 01:39:25,790
the United States that are spinning down
sperm and finding that they can separate

5436
01:39:25,790 --> 01:39:25,800
sperm and finding that they can separate
 

5437
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:27,470
sperm and finding that they can separate
out fractions as they're called you know

5438
01:39:27,470 --> 01:39:27,480
out fractions as they're called you know
 

5439
01:39:27,480 --> 01:39:29,090
out fractions as they're called you know
that can spin the sperm down at a given

01:39:29,090 --> 01:39:29,100
that can spin the sperm down at a given
 

5441
01:39:29,100 --> 01:39:30,649
that can spin the sperm down at a given
speed and they'll separate out at

5442
01:39:30,649 --> 01:39:30,659
speed and they'll separate out at
 

5443
01:39:30,659 --> 01:39:31,729
speed and they'll separate out at
different

5444
01:39:31,729 --> 01:39:31,739
different
 

5445
01:39:31,739 --> 01:39:34,129
different
um sort of depths within the test tube

5446
01:39:34,129 --> 01:39:34,139
um sort of depths within the test tube
 

5447
01:39:34,139 --> 01:39:37,370
um sort of depths within the test tube
that allow them to pull out the sperm on

5448
01:39:37,370 --> 01:39:37,380
that allow them to pull out the sperm on
 

5449
01:39:37,380 --> 01:39:41,030
that allow them to pull out the sperm on
top or below and bias the probability

5450
01:39:41,030 --> 01:39:41,040
top or below and bias the probability
 

5451
01:39:41,040 --> 01:39:43,070
top or below and bias the probability
towards male or female births it's not

5452
01:39:43,070 --> 01:39:43,080
towards male or female births it's not
 

5453
01:39:43,080 --> 01:39:45,350
towards male or female births it's not
perfect it's not 100 it's a very costly

5454
01:39:45,350 --> 01:39:45,360
perfect it's not 100 it's a very costly
 

5455
01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:47,810
perfect it's not 100 it's a very costly
procedure it's still very controversial

5456
01:39:47,810 --> 01:39:47,820
procedure it's still very controversial
 

5457
01:39:47,820 --> 01:39:50,209
procedure it's still very controversial
um now with in vitro fertilization it

5458
01:39:50,209 --> 01:39:50,219
um now with in vitro fertilization it
 

5459
01:39:50,219 --> 01:39:52,850
um now with in vitro fertilization it
can extract eggs you can do introduce a

5460
01:39:52,850 --> 01:39:52,860
can extract eggs you can do introduce a
 

5461
01:39:52,860 --> 01:39:55,910
can extract eggs you can do introduce a
sperm directly by pipette it's a process

5462
01:39:55,910 --> 01:39:55,920
sperm directly by pipette it's a process
 

5463
01:39:55,920 --> 01:39:57,830
sperm directly by pipette it's a process
called ixy or you can set up a sperm

5464
01:39:57,830 --> 01:39:57,840
called ixy or you can set up a sperm
 

5465
01:39:57,840 --> 01:39:59,990
called ixy or you can set up a sperm
race in a dish and if you get a number

5466
01:39:59,990 --> 01:40:00,000
race in a dish and if you get a number
 

5467
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,390
race in a dish and if you get a number
of different embryos

5468
01:40:02,390 --> 01:40:02,400
of different embryos
 

5469
01:40:02,400 --> 01:40:04,970
of different embryos
um meaning the eggs get fertilized to

5470
01:40:04,970 --> 01:40:04,980
um meaning the eggs get fertilized to
 

5471
01:40:04,980 --> 01:40:06,890
um meaning the eggs get fertilized to
duplicate and for start to form a

5472
01:40:06,890 --> 01:40:06,900
duplicate and for start to form a
 

5473
01:40:06,900 --> 01:40:08,390
duplicate and for start to form a
blastocyst which is a ball of cells

5474
01:40:08,390 --> 01:40:08,400
blastocyst which is a ball of cells
 

5475
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:11,209
blastocyst which is a ball of cells
early embryo then you can do karyotyping

5476
01:40:11,209 --> 01:40:11,219
early embryo then you can do karyotyping
 

5477
01:40:11,219 --> 01:40:13,550
early embryo then you can do karyotyping
so you can do look for XX or XY select

5478
01:40:13,550 --> 01:40:13,560
so you can do look for XX or XY select
 

5479
01:40:13,560 --> 01:40:15,770
so you can do look for XX or XY select
the XY which then would give rise to a

5480
01:40:15,770 --> 01:40:15,780
the XY which then would give rise to a
 

5481
01:40:15,780 --> 01:40:17,270
the XY which then would give rise to a
male offspring and then plant that one

5482
01:40:17,270 --> 01:40:17,280
male offspring and then plant that one
 

5483
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:21,110
male offspring and then plant that one
so there is that kind of sex selection

5484
01:40:21,110 --> 01:40:21,120
so there is that kind of sex selection
 

5485
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:22,370
so there is that kind of sex selection
um

5486
01:40:22,370 --> 01:40:22,380
um
 

5487
01:40:22,380 --> 01:40:24,410
um
with respect to position there's a lot

5488
01:40:24,410 --> 01:40:24,420
with respect to position there's a lot
 

5489
01:40:24,420 --> 01:40:27,050
with respect to position there's a lot
of lore that you know if

5490
01:40:27,050 --> 01:40:27,060
of lore that you know if
 

5491
01:40:27,060 --> 01:40:29,330
of lore that you know if
um the woman is on top or the woman's on

5492
01:40:29,330 --> 01:40:29,340
um the woman is on top or the woman's on
 

5493
01:40:29,340 --> 01:40:30,950
um the woman is on top or the woman's on
the bottom or whether or not the

5494
01:40:30,950 --> 01:40:30,960
the bottom or whether or not the
 

5495
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:33,050
the bottom or whether or not the
penetration is from behind whether or

5496
01:40:33,050 --> 01:40:33,060
penetration is from behind whether or
 

5497
01:40:33,060 --> 01:40:34,129
penetration is from behind whether or
not it's going to be male or female

5498
01:40:34,129 --> 01:40:34,139
not it's going to be male or female
 

5499
01:40:34,139 --> 01:40:36,890
not it's going to be male or female
Offspring and frankly the data are not

5500
01:40:36,890 --> 01:40:36,900
Offspring and frankly the data are not
 

5501
01:40:36,900 --> 01:40:38,750
Offspring and frankly the data are not
great as you can imagine because those

5502
01:40:38,750 --> 01:40:38,760
great as you can imagine because those
 

5503
01:40:38,760 --> 01:40:41,689
great as you can imagine because those
those would be interesting studies to

5504
01:40:41,689 --> 01:40:41,699
those would be interesting studies to
 

5505
01:40:41,699 --> 01:40:43,850
those would be interesting studies to
run perhaps

5506
01:40:43,850 --> 01:40:43,860
run perhaps
 

5507
01:40:43,860 --> 01:40:45,709
run perhaps
um there is studies there is paper there

5508
01:40:45,709 --> 01:40:45,719
um there is studies there is paper there
 

5509
01:40:45,719 --> 01:40:47,450
um there is studies there is paper there
are some there are they're not I guess

5510
01:40:47,450 --> 01:40:47,460
are some there are they're not I guess
 

5511
01:40:47,460 --> 01:40:49,790
are some there are they're not I guess
yeah there's more lore than science and

5512
01:40:49,790 --> 01:40:49,800
yeah there's more lore than science and
 

5513
01:40:49,800 --> 01:40:50,990
yeah there's more lore than science and
there's a lot of and there are a lot of

5514
01:40:50,990 --> 01:40:51,000
there's a lot of and there are a lot of
 

5515
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:52,310
there's a lot of and there are a lot of
other variables that are hard to control

5516
01:40:52,310 --> 01:40:52,320
other variables that are hard to control
 

5517
01:40:52,320 --> 01:40:54,950
other variables that are hard to control
so for instance if it if it's um

5518
01:40:54,950 --> 01:40:54,960
so for instance if it if it's um
 

5519
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:57,350
so for instance if it if it's um
ejaculation during intermission during

5520
01:40:57,350 --> 01:40:57,360
ejaculation during intermission during
 

5521
01:40:57,360 --> 01:41:00,290
ejaculation during intermission during
during sex penetration Etc

5522
01:41:00,290 --> 01:41:00,300
during sex penetration Etc
 

5523
01:41:00,300 --> 01:41:01,129
during sex penetration Etc
um

5524
01:41:01,129 --> 01:41:01,139
um
 

5525
01:41:01,139 --> 01:41:03,229
um
then you can't measure for instance

5526
01:41:03,229 --> 01:41:03,239
then you can't measure for instance
 

5527
01:41:03,239 --> 01:41:05,930
then you can't measure for instance
sperm volume as opposed to when it's IVF

5528
01:41:05,930 --> 01:41:05,940
sperm volume as opposed to when it's IVF
 

5529
01:41:05,940 --> 01:41:07,070
sperm volume as opposed to when it's IVF
and they can actually measure how many

5530
01:41:07,070 --> 01:41:07,080
and they can actually measure how many
 

5531
01:41:07,080 --> 01:41:08,570
and they can actually measure how many
milliliters how many forward motile

5532
01:41:08,570 --> 01:41:08,580
milliliters how many forward motile
 

5533
01:41:08,580 --> 01:41:10,189
milliliters how many forward motile
sperm it's hard to control for for

5534
01:41:10,189 --> 01:41:10,199
sperm it's hard to control for for
 

5535
01:41:10,199 --> 01:41:12,649
sperm it's hard to control for for
certain things and um this can vary

5536
01:41:12,649 --> 01:41:12,659
certain things and um this can vary
 

5537
01:41:12,659 --> 01:41:14,510
certain things and um this can vary
between individuals and even from one

5538
01:41:14,510 --> 01:41:14,520
between individuals and even from one
 

5539
01:41:14,520 --> 01:41:16,370
between individuals and even from one
ejaculation the next and okay so there's

5540
01:41:16,370 --> 01:41:16,380
ejaculation the next and okay so there's
 

5541
01:41:16,380 --> 01:41:19,250
ejaculation the next and okay so there's
too many variables however the position

5542
01:41:19,250 --> 01:41:19,260
too many variables however the position
 

5543
01:41:19,260 --> 01:41:21,410
too many variables however the position
thing is interesting

5544
01:41:21,410 --> 01:41:21,420
thing is interesting
 

5545
01:41:21,420 --> 01:41:23,390
thing is interesting
in the following way

5546
01:41:23,390 --> 01:41:23,400
in the following way
 

5547
01:41:23,400 --> 01:41:24,350
in the following way
um and then I'll answer whether or not

5548
01:41:24,350 --> 01:41:24,360
um and then I'll answer whether or not
 

5549
01:41:24,360 --> 01:41:26,450
um and then I'll answer whether or not
you can bias towards a female

5550
01:41:26,450 --> 01:41:26,460
you can bias towards a female
 

5551
01:41:26,460 --> 01:41:27,890
you can bias towards a female
um as long as we're as long as we're

5552
01:41:27,890 --> 01:41:27,900
um as long as we're as long as we're
 

5553
01:41:27,900 --> 01:41:29,149
um as long as we're as long as we're
trying I have other questions about sex

5554
01:41:29,149 --> 01:41:29,159
trying I have other questions about sex
 

5555
01:41:29,159 --> 01:41:29,990
trying I have other questions about sex
but as long as we're talking about

5556
01:41:29,990 --> 01:41:30,000
but as long as we're talking about
 

5557
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:33,649
but as long as we're talking about
sexual position all right there are data

5558
01:41:33,649 --> 01:41:33,659
sexual position all right there are data
 

5559
01:41:33,659 --> 01:41:37,010
sexual position all right there are data
that support the idea that in order to

5560
01:41:37,010 --> 01:41:37,020
that support the idea that in order to
 

5561
01:41:37,020 --> 01:41:40,910
that support the idea that in order to
increase the probability of successful

5562
01:41:40,910 --> 01:41:40,920
increase the probability of successful
 

5563
01:41:40,920 --> 01:41:42,530
increase the probability of successful
fertilization

5564
01:41:42,530 --> 01:41:42,540
fertilization
 

5565
01:41:42,540 --> 01:41:45,830
fertilization
that indeed the woman should not stand

5566
01:41:45,830 --> 01:41:45,840
that indeed the woman should not stand
 

5567
01:41:45,840 --> 01:41:48,050
that indeed the woman should not stand
upright after sex

5568
01:41:48,050 --> 01:41:48,060
upright after sex
 

5569
01:41:48,060 --> 01:41:50,810
upright after sex
and should right after right after the

5570
01:41:50,810 --> 01:41:50,820
and should right after right after the
 

5571
01:41:50,820 --> 01:41:52,850
and should right after right after the
man is ejaculated inside her and should

5572
01:41:52,850 --> 01:41:52,860
man is ejaculated inside her and should
 

5573
01:41:52,860 --> 01:41:55,790
man is ejaculated inside her and should
adjust her pelvis say 15 degrees upwards

5574
01:41:55,790 --> 01:41:55,800
adjust her pelvis say 15 degrees upwards
 

5575
01:41:55,800 --> 01:41:57,470
adjust her pelvis say 15 degrees upwards
I mean you know

5576
01:41:57,470 --> 01:41:57,480
I mean you know
 

5577
01:41:57,480 --> 01:42:00,709
I mean you know
some of the fertility experts MDS will

5578
01:42:00,709 --> 01:42:00,719
some of the fertility experts MDS will
 

5579
01:42:00,719 --> 01:42:03,709
some of the fertility experts MDS will
say that's crazy you know but others

5580
01:42:03,709 --> 01:42:03,719
say that's crazy you know but others
 

5581
01:42:03,719 --> 01:42:05,390
say that's crazy you know but others
that I

5582
01:42:05,390 --> 01:42:05,400
that I
 

5583
01:42:05,400 --> 01:42:08,149
that I
sought out and not specifically for this

5584
01:42:08,149 --> 01:42:08,159
sought out and not specifically for this
 

5585
01:42:08,159 --> 01:42:10,609
sought out and not specifically for this
answer but for researching that episode

5586
01:42:10,609 --> 01:42:10,619
answer but for researching that episode
 

5587
01:42:10,619 --> 01:42:11,810
answer but for researching that episode
said that yeah you know what you're

5588
01:42:11,810 --> 01:42:11,820
said that yeah you know what you're
 

5589
01:42:11,820 --> 01:42:12,770
said that yeah you know what you're
talking about is trying to get the

5590
01:42:12,770 --> 01:42:12,780
talking about is trying to get the
 

5591
01:42:12,780 --> 01:42:14,930
talking about is trying to get the
maximum number of sperm and it's

5592
01:42:14,930 --> 01:42:14,940
maximum number of sperm and it's
 

5593
01:42:14,940 --> 01:42:17,030
maximum number of sperm and it's
contained in semen and yes the semen can

5594
01:42:17,030 --> 01:42:17,040
contained in semen and yes the semen can
 

5595
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:19,310
contained in semen and yes the semen can
leak out and so keeping um the pelvis

5596
01:42:19,310 --> 01:42:19,320
leak out and so keeping um the pelvis
 

5597
01:42:19,320 --> 01:42:21,530
leak out and so keeping um the pelvis
tilted for about at 15 degrees for about

5598
01:42:21,530 --> 01:42:21,540
tilted for about at 15 degrees for about
 

5599
01:42:21,540 --> 01:42:23,870
tilted for about at 15 degrees for about
15 minutes obviously tilted in the

5600
01:42:23,870 --> 01:42:23,880
15 minutes obviously tilted in the
 

5601
01:42:23,880 --> 01:42:25,070
15 minutes obviously tilted in the
direction that would have things running

5602
01:42:25,070 --> 01:42:25,080
direction that would have things running
 

5603
01:42:25,080 --> 01:42:27,790
direction that would have things running
Upstream not Downstream so to speak

5604
01:42:27,790 --> 01:42:27,800
Upstream not Downstream so to speak
 

5605
01:42:27,800 --> 01:42:31,010
Upstream not Downstream so to speak
would gravity it's real

5606
01:42:31,010 --> 01:42:31,020
would gravity it's real
 

5607
01:42:31,020 --> 01:42:32,330
would gravity it's real
um you know

5608
01:42:32,330 --> 01:42:32,340
um you know
 

5609
01:42:32,340 --> 01:42:35,810
um you know
um so so for maximizing uh fertilization

5610
01:42:35,810 --> 01:42:35,820
um so so for maximizing uh fertilization
 

5611
01:42:35,820 --> 01:42:38,270
um so so for maximizing uh fertilization
you know that the doctors I spoke to

5612
01:42:38,270 --> 01:42:38,280
you know that the doctors I spoke to
 

5613
01:42:38,280 --> 01:42:41,090
you know that the doctors I spoke to
just said look given that if people are

5614
01:42:41,090 --> 01:42:41,100
just said look given that if people are
 

5615
01:42:41,100 --> 01:42:43,129
just said look given that if people are
trying to get pregnant what is spending

5616
01:42:43,129 --> 01:42:43,139
trying to get pregnant what is spending
 

5617
01:42:43,139 --> 01:42:45,350
trying to get pregnant what is spending
15 minutes on their back

5618
01:42:45,350 --> 01:42:45,360
15 minutes on their back
 

5619
01:42:45,360 --> 01:42:47,510
15 minutes on their back
um you know this sort of thing okay so

5620
01:42:47,510 --> 01:42:47,520
um you know this sort of thing okay so
 

5621
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:50,629
um you know this sort of thing okay so
then with respect to there to female

5622
01:42:50,629 --> 01:42:50,639
then with respect to there to female
 

5623
01:42:50,639 --> 01:42:54,290
then with respect to there to female
getting a female Offspring or XX

5624
01:42:54,290 --> 01:42:54,300
getting a female Offspring or XX
 

5625
01:42:54,300 --> 01:42:56,570
getting a female Offspring or XX
female Offspring

5626
01:42:56,570 --> 01:42:56,580
female Offspring
 

5627
01:42:56,580 --> 01:42:57,430
female Offspring
um

5628
01:42:57,430 --> 01:42:57,440
um
 

5629
01:42:57,440 --> 01:43:00,590
um
selectively there is the idea that as

5630
01:43:00,590 --> 01:43:00,600
selectively there is the idea that as
 

5631
01:43:00,600 --> 01:43:02,390
selectively there is the idea that as
fathers get older they're more likely to

5632
01:43:02,390 --> 01:43:02,400
fathers get older they're more likely to
 

5633
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:04,970
fathers get older they're more likely to
have daughters as opposed to Sons that's

5634
01:43:04,970 --> 01:43:04,980
have daughters as opposed to Sons that's
 

5635
01:43:04,980 --> 01:43:07,910
have daughters as opposed to Sons that's
a from the papers I've read is a

5636
01:43:07,910 --> 01:43:07,920
a from the papers I've read is a
 

5637
01:43:07,920 --> 01:43:10,850
a from the papers I've read is a
significant but still mildly significant

5638
01:43:10,850 --> 01:43:10,860
significant but still mildly significant
 

5639
01:43:10,860 --> 01:43:13,970
significant but still mildly significant
result so at with each passing year

5640
01:43:13,970 --> 01:43:13,980
result so at with each passing year
 

5641
01:43:13,980 --> 01:43:16,310
result so at with each passing year
um this person increases the probability

5642
01:43:16,310 --> 01:43:16,320
um this person increases the probability
 

5643
01:43:16,320 --> 01:43:17,689
um this person increases the probability
they're gonna have a daughter not a son

5644
01:43:17,689 --> 01:43:17,699
they're gonna have a daughter not a son
 

5645
01:43:17,699 --> 01:43:20,209
they're gonna have a daughter not a son
look um so that's interesting but the

5646
01:43:20,209 --> 01:43:20,219
look um so that's interesting but the
 

5647
01:43:20,219 --> 01:43:21,590
look um so that's interesting but the
probability differences are probably

5648
01:43:21,590 --> 01:43:21,600
probability differences are probably
 

5649
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:24,649
probability differences are probably
tiniest I mean it's it's not you know

5650
01:43:24,649 --> 01:43:24,659
tiniest I mean it's it's not you know
 

5651
01:43:24,659 --> 01:43:27,350
tiniest I mean it's it's not you know
it's a signif it's not trivial it's not

5652
01:43:27,350 --> 01:43:27,360
it's a signif it's not trivial it's not
 

5653
01:43:27,360 --> 01:43:29,149
it's a signif it's not trivial it's not
a trivial difference

5654
01:43:29,149 --> 01:43:29,159
a trivial difference
 

5655
01:43:29,159 --> 01:43:32,270
a trivial difference
um but if they want to ensure having

5656
01:43:32,270 --> 01:43:32,280
um but if they want to ensure having
 

5657
01:43:32,280 --> 01:43:34,790
um but if they want to ensure having
a daughter then they should do IVF and

5658
01:43:34,790 --> 01:43:34,800
a daughter then they should do IVF and
 

5659
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:38,570
a daughter then they should do IVF and
select an xxm um embryo and um when you

5660
01:43:38,570 --> 01:43:38,580
select an xxm um embryo and um when you
 

5661
01:43:38,580 --> 01:43:40,490
select an xxm um embryo and um when you
go through IVF they genetically screen

5662
01:43:40,490 --> 01:43:40,500
go through IVF they genetically screen
 

5663
01:43:40,500 --> 01:43:43,910
go through IVF they genetically screen
them for karyotype which is xxxy

5664
01:43:43,910 --> 01:43:43,920
them for karyotype which is xxxy
 

5665
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:47,450
them for karyotype which is xxxy
um and they look at mutations genotypic

5666
01:43:47,450 --> 01:43:47,460
um and they look at mutations genotypic
 

5667
01:43:47,460 --> 01:43:49,370
um and they look at mutations genotypic
mutations for things like you know

5668
01:43:49,370 --> 01:43:49,380
mutations for things like you know
 

5669
01:43:49,380 --> 01:43:52,550
mutations for things like you know
trisomies and the employees all the

5670
01:43:52,550 --> 01:43:52,560
trisomies and the employees all the
 

5671
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:53,870
trisomies and the employees all the
stuff you don't want

5672
01:43:53,870 --> 01:43:53,880
stuff you don't want
 

5673
01:43:53,880 --> 01:43:55,729
stuff you don't want
but there is a lot of lore if you look

5674
01:43:55,729 --> 01:43:55,739
but there is a lot of lore if you look
 

5675
01:43:55,739 --> 01:43:57,649
but there is a lot of lore if you look
on the internet sure different foods uh

5676
01:43:57,649 --> 01:43:57,659
on the internet sure different foods uh
 

5677
01:43:57,659 --> 01:43:59,090
on the internet sure different foods uh
so a lot of variables there's a lot of

5678
01:43:59,090 --> 01:43:59,100
so a lot of variables there's a lot of
 

5679
01:43:59,100 --> 01:44:00,470
so a lot of variables there's a lot of
area but there haven't been systematic

5680
01:44:00,470 --> 01:44:00,480
area but there haven't been systematic
 

5681
01:44:00,480 --> 01:44:02,030
area but there haven't been systematic
studies so

5682
01:44:02,030 --> 01:44:02,040
studies so
 

5683
01:44:02,040 --> 01:44:04,910
studies so
um I think probably the best thing to do

5684
01:44:04,910 --> 01:44:04,920
um I think probably the best thing to do
 

5685
01:44:04,920 --> 01:44:06,709
um I think probably the best thing to do
unless they're going to do IVF is just

5686
01:44:06,709 --> 01:44:06,719
unless they're going to do IVF is just
 

5687
01:44:06,719 --> 01:44:09,709
unless they're going to do IVF is just
you know roll the dice and um you know

5688
01:44:09,709 --> 01:44:09,719
you know roll the dice and um you know
 

5689
01:44:09,719 --> 01:44:11,450
you know roll the dice and um you know
and I think uh with each passing year

5690
01:44:11,450 --> 01:44:11,460
and I think uh with each passing year
 

5691
01:44:11,460 --> 01:44:13,550
and I think uh with each passing year
they increase the probability of getting

5692
01:44:13,550 --> 01:44:13,560
they increase the probability of getting
 

5693
01:44:13,560 --> 01:44:15,169
they increase the probability of getting
a female Offspring

5694
01:44:15,169 --> 01:44:15,179
a female Offspring
 

5695
01:44:15,179 --> 01:44:16,910
a female Offspring
um and with but of course with each

5696
01:44:16,910 --> 01:44:16,920
um and with but of course with each
 

5697
01:44:16,920 --> 01:44:19,669
um and with but of course with each
passing year the egg and sperm quality

5698
01:44:19,669 --> 01:44:19,679
passing year the egg and sperm quality
 

5699
01:44:19,679 --> 01:44:23,570
passing year the egg and sperm quality
degrade so you know get after it soon so

5700
01:44:23,570 --> 01:44:23,580
degrade so you know get after it soon so
 

5701
01:44:23,580 --> 01:44:25,790
degrade so you know get after it soon so
uh I went down a rabbit hole there's

5702
01:44:25,790 --> 01:44:25,800
uh I went down a rabbit hole there's
 

5703
01:44:25,800 --> 01:44:28,189
uh I went down a rabbit hole there's

interesting factoid is that
 

5771
01:45:41,460 --> 01:45:45,169
interesting factoid is that
only three only three percent of sexual

5772
01:45:45,169 --> 01:45:45,179
only three only three percent of sexual
 

5773
01:45:45,179 --> 01:45:46,970
only three only three percent of sexual
dysfunction is

5774
01:45:46,970 --> 01:45:46,980
dysfunction is
 

5775
01:45:46,980 --> 01:45:48,609
dysfunction is
foreign

5776
01:45:48,609 --> 01:45:48,619
foreign
 

5777
01:45:48,619 --> 01:45:52,189
foreign
in nature it's more often related to

5778
01:45:52,189 --> 01:45:52,199
in nature it's more often related to
 

5779
01:45:52,199 --> 01:45:55,250
in nature it's more often related to
some pelvic floor or vasculature blood

5780
01:45:55,250 --> 01:45:55,260
some pelvic floor or vasculature blood
 

5781
01:45:55,260 --> 01:45:58,790
some pelvic floor or vasculature blood
flow related or other issue and then

5782
01:45:58,790 --> 01:45:58,800
flow related or other issue and then
 

5783
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:00,770
flow related or other issue and then
when Eisenberg came on the podcast he

5784
01:46:00,770 --> 01:46:00,780
when Eisenberg came on the podcast he
 

5785
01:46:00,780 --> 01:46:04,550
when Eisenberg came on the podcast he
said that far less sexual dysfunction is

5786

said that far less sexual dysfunction is
 

5787
01:46:04,560 --> 01:46:07,129
said that far less sexual dysfunction is
psychogenic in origin then people

5788
01:46:07,129 --> 01:46:07,139
psychogenic in origin then people
 

5789
01:46:07,139 --> 01:46:08,990
psychogenic in origin then people
believe that far more of it is pelvic

5790
01:46:08,990 --> 01:46:09,000
believe that far more of it is pelvic
 

5791
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,629
believe that far more of it is pelvic
floor neuro and Vascular so you know

for those and um and so those both those
 

5813
01:46:33,179 --> 01:46:35,390
for those and um and so those both those
episodes detail some of the

5814
01:46:35,390 --> 01:46:35,400
episodes detail some of the
 

5815
01:46:35,400 --> 01:46:37,370
episodes detail some of the
um more Salient points about what those

5816
01:46:37,370 --> 01:46:37,380
um more Salient points about what those
 

5817
01:46:37,380 --> 01:46:39,470
um more Salient points about what those
remedies are and could be I mean one of

5818
01:46:39,470 --> 01:46:39,480
remedies are and could be I mean one of
 

5819
01:46:39,480 --> 01:46:41,810
remedies are and could be I mean one of
the kind of again

5820
01:46:41,810 --> 01:46:41,820
the kind of again
 

5821
01:46:41,820 --> 01:46:43,790
the kind of again
factoids but it's interesting that you

5822
01:46:43,790 --> 01:46:43,800
factoids but it's interesting that you
 

5823
01:46:43,800 --> 01:46:44,810
factoids but it's interesting that you
know a lot of people have pelvic floor

5824

floors are
 

5829
01:46:48,119 --> 01:46:50,209
floors are
um quote unquote messed up so they go on

5830
01:46:50,209 --> 01:46:50,219
um quote unquote messed up so they go on
 

5831
01:46:50,219 --> 01:46:51,470
um quote unquote messed up so they go on
the internet they learn about kegels

5832
01:46:51,470 --> 01:46:51,480
the internet they learn about kegels
 

5833
01:46:51,480 --> 01:46:53,629
the internet they learn about kegels
kegels that you know and it turns out

5834
01:46:53,629 --> 01:46:53,639
kegels that you know and it turns out
 

5835
01:46:53,639 --> 01:46:55,669
kegels that you know and it turns out
that some people need Giggles they need

5836
01:46:55,669 --> 01:46:55,679
that some people need Giggles they need
 

5837
01:46:55,679 --> 01:46:57,109
that some people need Giggles they need
to strengthen their pelvic floor guess

5838
01:46:57,109 --> 01:46:57,119
to strengthen their pelvic floor guess
 

5839
01:46:57,119 --> 01:46:58,129
to strengthen their pelvic floor guess
what

5840
01:46:58,129 --> 01:46:58,139
what
 

5841
01:46:58,139 --> 01:47:00,590
what
a huge number of people with sexual and

5842
01:47:00,590 --> 01:47:00,600
a huge number of people with sexual and
 

5843
01:47:00,600 --> 01:47:02,270
a huge number of people with sexual and
neurologic

5844
01:47:02,270 --> 01:47:02,280
neurologic
 

5845
01:47:02,280 --> 01:47:04,189
neurologic
dysfunction

5846
01:47:04,189 --> 01:47:04,199
dysfunction
 

5847
01:47:04,199 --> 01:47:05,930
dysfunction
have pelvic floors that are too tight

5848
01:47:05,930 --> 01:47:05,940
have pelvic floors that are too tight
 

5849
01:47:05,940 --> 01:47:07,370
have pelvic floors that are too tight
and kegels are going to make them far

5850
01:47:07,370 --> 01:47:07,380
and kegels are going to make them far
 

5851
01:47:07,380 --> 01:47:09,169
and kegels are going to make them far
worse and they actually need to learn to

5852
01:47:09,169 --> 01:47:09,179
worse and they actually need to learn to
 

5853
01:47:09,179 --> 01:47:10,609
worse and they actually need to learn to
relax their pelvic floor instead of

5854
01:47:10,609 --> 01:47:10,619
relax their pelvic floor instead of
 

5855
01:47:10,619 --> 01:47:11,990
relax their pelvic floor instead of
seeing a pelvic floor specialist is

5856
01:47:11,990 --> 01:47:12,000
seeing a pelvic floor specialist is
 

5857
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:13,790
seeing a pelvic floor specialist is
important I think in the next five ten

5858
01:47:13,790 --> 01:47:13,800
important I think in the next five ten
 

5859
01:47:13,800 --> 01:47:15,830
important I think in the next five ten
years we're going to see a dramatic

5860
01:47:15,830 --> 01:47:15,840
years we're going to see a dramatic
 

5861
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:17,390
years we're going to see a dramatic
shift towards more discussion about

5862
01:47:17,390 --> 01:47:17,400
shift towards more discussion about
 

5863
01:47:17,400 --> 01:47:19,430
shift towards more discussion about
sexual and reproductive Health in a way

5864
01:47:19,430 --> 01:47:19,440
sexual and reproductive Health in a way
 

5865
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:21,470
sexual and reproductive Health in a way
that acknowledges that yeah the clitoris

5866
01:47:21,470 --> 01:47:21,480
that acknowledges that yeah the clitoris
 

5867
01:47:21,480 --> 01:47:23,450
that acknowledges that yeah the clitoris
is comes from the same origin tissue as

5868
01:47:23,450 --> 01:47:23,460
is comes from the same origin tissue as
 

5869
01:47:23,460 --> 01:47:26,510
is comes from the same origin tissue as
the the penis and in many ways that the

5870
01:47:26,510 --> 01:47:26,520
the the penis and in many ways that the
 

5871
01:47:26,520 --> 01:47:28,189
the the penis and in many ways that the
neural innervation of the two while

5872
01:47:28,189 --> 01:47:28,199
neural innervation of the two while
 

5873
01:47:28,199 --> 01:47:30,950
neural innervation of the two while
clearly different has some overlapping

5874
01:47:30,950 --> 01:47:30,960
clearly different has some overlapping
 

5875
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:32,570
clearly different has some overlapping
features that

5876
01:47:32,570 --> 01:47:32,580
features that
 

5877
01:47:32,580 --> 01:47:34,189
features that
um you know that there's going to be

5878
01:47:34,189 --> 01:47:34,199
um you know that there's going to be
 

5879
01:47:34,199 --> 01:47:36,709
um you know that there's going to be
discussion around kind of anatomy and

5880
01:47:36,709 --> 01:47:36,719
discussion around kind of anatomy and
 

5881
01:47:36,719 --> 01:47:39,709
discussion around kind of anatomy and
hormones and pelvic floors and

5882
01:47:39,709 --> 01:47:39,719
hormones and pelvic floors and
 

5883
01:47:39,719 --> 01:47:42,649
hormones and pelvic floors and
um in a way that's gonna you know um

5884
01:47:42,649 --> 01:47:42,659
um in a way that's gonna you know um
 

5885
01:47:42,659 --> 01:47:44,689
um in a way that's gonna you know um
erode some of the the kind of like

5886
01:47:44,689 --> 01:47:44,699
erode some of the the kind of like
 

5887
01:47:44,699 --> 01:47:46,790
erode some of the the kind of like
cloaking of these topics because they've

5888
01:47:46,790 --> 01:47:46,800
cloaking of these topics because they've
 

5889
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:48,410
cloaking of these topics because they've
been cloaked for a long time and there's

5890
01:47:48,410 --> 01:47:48,420
been cloaked for a long time and there's
 

5891
01:47:48,420 --> 01:47:50,149
been cloaked for a long time and there's
a lot of like

5892
01:47:50,149 --> 01:47:50,159
a lot of like
 

5893
01:47:50,159 --> 01:47:51,649
a lot of like
but let's just call what it is there's a

5894
01:47:51,649 --> 01:47:51,659
but let's just call what it is there's a
 

5895
01:47:51,659 --> 01:47:52,790
but let's just call what it is there's a
lot of out there about what's

5896
01:47:52,790 --> 01:47:52,800
lot of out there about what's
 

5897
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:54,109
lot of out there about what's
what

5898
01:47:54,109 --> 01:47:54,119
what
 

5899
01:47:54,119 --> 01:47:56,570
what
um and now the hormonal issues by the

5900
01:47:56,570 --> 01:47:56,580
um and now the hormonal issues by the
 

5901
01:47:56,580 --> 01:48:00,590
um and now the hormonal issues by the
way just to clarify can impact desire so

5902
01:48:00,590 --> 01:48:00,600
way just to clarify can impact desire so
 

5903
01:48:00,600 --> 01:48:02,689
way just to clarify can impact desire so
a lot of people who have lack of desire

5904
01:48:02,689 --> 01:48:02,699
a lot of people who have lack of desire
 

5905
01:48:02,699 --> 01:48:04,910
a lot of people who have lack of desire
as opposed to lack of anatomical

5906
01:48:04,910 --> 01:48:04,920
as opposed to lack of anatomical
 

5907
01:48:04,920 --> 01:48:06,950
as opposed to lack of anatomical
function this could be male or female

5908
01:48:06,950 --> 01:48:06,960
function this could be male or female
 

5909
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:09,169
function this could be male or female
that that can originate with either

5910
01:48:09,169 --> 01:48:09,179
that that can originate with either
 

5911
01:48:09,179 --> 01:48:12,290
that that can originate with either
things like ssris or hormonal issues and

5912
01:48:12,290 --> 01:48:12,300
things like ssris or hormonal issues and
 

5913
01:48:12,300 --> 01:48:13,910
things like ssris or hormonal issues and
so we talk about that as well so it's a

5914
01:48:13,910 --> 01:48:13,920
so we talk about that as well so it's a
 

5915
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:16,250
so we talk about that as well so it's a
pretty vast topic okay you've uh you're

they're going to be there's going to be
 

5955
01:49:00,600 --> 01:49:02,270
they're going to be there's going to be
a lot of really good scientists

5956
01:49:02,270 --> 01:49:02,280
a lot of really good scientists
 

5957
01:49:02,280 --> 01:49:04,310
a lot of really good scientists

that I was perhaps could have been

6034
01:50:26,510 --> 01:50:26,520
that I was perhaps could have been
 

6035
01:50:26,520 --> 01:50:28,370
that I was perhaps could have been
clearer about

6036
01:50:28,370 --> 01:50:28,380
clearer about
 

6037
01:50:28,380 --> 01:50:31,370
clearer about
um but yeah you you're always concerned

6038
01:50:31,370 --> 01:50:31,380
um but yeah you you're always concerned

6041
01:50:33,540 --> 01:50:35,270
that people won't either won't get it or
I won't be clear so that the researching

6042
01:50:35,270 --> 01:50:35,280
I won't be clear so that the researching
 

6043
01:50:35,280 --> 01:50:36,830
I won't be clear so that the researching
is mainly about finding the best papers

6044
01:50:36,830 --> 01:50:36,840
is mainly about finding the best papers
 

6045
01:50:36,840 --> 01:50:38,870
is mainly about finding the best papers
and then I'm looking for papers that

6046
01:50:38,870 --> 01:50:38,880
and then I'm looking for papers that
 

6047
01:50:38,880 --> 01:50:42,830
and then I'm looking for papers that
establish thoroughness of understanding

6048
01:50:42,830 --> 01:50:42,840
establish thoroughness of understanding
 

6049
01:50:42,840 --> 01:50:45,890
establish thoroughness of understanding
um that are interesting obviously it's

6050
01:50:45,890 --> 01:50:45,900
um that are interesting obviously it's
 

6051
01:50:45,900 --> 01:50:48,350
um that are interesting obviously it's
fun to get occasionally look at some of

fun to get occasionally look at some of
 

6053
01:50:48,360 --> 01:50:50,390
fun to get occasionally look at some of
the odd or more Progressive papers that

these days I use a whiteboard before I

6156
01:52:34,010 --> 01:52:34,020
these days I use a whiteboard before I
 

6157
01:52:34,020 --> 01:52:35,390
these days I use a whiteboard before I
start I don't have any notes no

teleprompter then the white board that I

6160
01:52:37,970 --> 01:52:37,980
teleprompter then the white board that I
 

6161
01:52:37,980 --> 01:52:40,010
teleprompter then the white board that I
use beforehand is to really sculpt out

6162
01:52:40,010 --> 01:52:40,020
use beforehand is to really sculpt out
 

6163
01:52:40,020 --> 01:52:41,689
use beforehand is to really sculpt out
the different elements and and the flow

6164
01:52:41,689 --> 01:52:41,699
the different elements and and the flow
 

6165
01:52:41,699 --> 01:52:44,090
the different elements and and the flow
get the flow right and move things

6166
01:52:44,090 --> 01:52:44,100
get the flow right and move things
 

6167
01:52:44,100 --> 01:52:45,709
get the flow right and move things
around the the Whiteboard is such a

pictures of that
 

6173
01:52:48,300 --> 01:52:50,149
pictures of that
when I'm happy with it put it down on

6174
01:52:50,149 --> 01:52:50,159
when I'm happy with it put it down on

the desk and these are just bullet
 

6177
01:52:51,420 --> 01:52:53,570
the desk and these are just bullet
points and then just churn through and

6178
01:52:53,570 --> 01:52:53,580
points and then just churn through and
 

6179
01:52:53,580 --> 01:52:55,189
points and then just churn through and
just turn through and nothing feels

6180
01:52:55,189 --> 01:52:55,199
just turn through and nothing feels
 

6181

tangent but I think this might thread
 

6639
02:01:08,099 --> 02:01:09,169

pretty key importance one is romantic
relationships and the other is creative

6646
02:01:15,229 --> 02:01:15,239
relationships and the other is creative
 

6647
02:01:15,239 --> 02:01:17,510
relationships and the other is creative
process and work and this again is

6648
02:01:17,510 --> 02:01:17,520
process and work and this again is
 

6649
02:01:17,520 --> 02:01:18,950
process and work and this again is
something I learned from Rick but that

6650
02:01:18,950 --> 02:01:18,960
something I learned from Rick but that
 

6651
02:01:18,960 --> 02:01:20,689
something I learned from Rick but that
he and I have gone back and forth on and

6652
02:01:20,689 --> 02:01:20,699
he and I have gone back and forth on and
 

6653
02:01:20,699 --> 02:01:21,470
he and I have gone back and forth on and
that

6654
02:01:21,470 --> 02:01:21,480
that
 

6655
02:01:21,480 --> 02:01:23,810
that
um I think is worth elaborating on which

6656
02:01:23,810 --> 02:01:23,820
um I think is worth elaborating on which
 

6657
02:01:23,820 --> 02:01:24,709
um I think is worth elaborating on which
is

6658
02:01:24,709 --> 02:01:24,719
is
 

6659
02:01:24,719 --> 02:01:26,330

on your work can you not be worried
about whether or not they're okay

6694
02:02:05,750 --> 02:02:05,760
about whether or not they're okay
 

6695
02:02:05,760 --> 02:02:07,189
about whether or not they're okay
because you trust that they're an adult

6696
02:02:07,189 --> 02:02:07,199
because you trust that they're an adult
 

6697
02:02:07,199 --> 02:02:08,629
because you trust that they're an adult
and they can handle things or they will

6698
02:02:08,629 --> 02:02:08,639
and they can handle things or they will
 

6699
02:02:08,639 --> 02:02:10,729
and they can handle things or they will
reach out if they need things

6700
02:02:10,729 --> 02:02:10,739
reach out if they need things
 

6701
02:02:10,739 --> 02:02:12,169
reach out if they need things
um they're going to communicate their

6702
02:02:12,169 --> 02:02:12,179
um they're going to communicate their
 

6703
02:02:12,179 --> 02:02:14,149
um they're going to communicate their
needs like an adult you know not

6704
02:02:14,149 --> 02:02:14,159
needs like an adult you know not
 

6705
02:02:14,159 --> 02:02:16,129
needs like an adult you know not
creating message just to get attention

6706
02:02:16,129 --> 02:02:16,139
creating message just to get attention
 

6707
02:02:16,139 --> 02:02:18,649
creating message just to get attention
and things like that or

6708
02:02:18,649 --> 02:02:18,659
and things like that or
 

6709
02:02:18,659 --> 02:02:20,629
and things like that or
or disappearing you know for that matter

6710
02:02:20,629 --> 02:02:20,639
or disappearing you know for that matter
 

6711
02:02:20,639 --> 02:02:23,149
or disappearing you know for that matter
so

6712
02:02:23,149 --> 02:02:23,159
so
 

6713
02:02:23,159 --> 02:02:27,129
so
peace and focus are intimately related

6714
02:02:27,129 --> 02:02:27,139
peace and focus are intimately related
 

6715
02:02:27,139 --> 02:02:30,589
peace and focus are intimately related
and distraction is the enemy of peace

6716
02:02:30,589 --> 02:02:30,599
and distraction is the enemy of peace
 

6717
02:02:30,599 --> 02:02:32,270
and distraction is the enemy of peace
and focus

6718
02:02:32,270 --> 02:02:32,280
and focus
 

6719
02:02:32,280 --> 02:02:34,790
and focus
so there's something there I believe

and focus I think and present being

6746
02:02:59,990 --> 02:03:00,000
and focus I think and present being
 

6747
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,510
and focus I think and present being
present are so key and it's key at every

6748
02:03:02,510 --> 02:03:02,520
present are so key and it's key at every
 

6749
02:03:02,520 --> 02:03:04,729
present are so key and it's key at every
level of romantic relationship from

6750
02:03:04,729 --> 02:03:04,739
level of romantic relationship from
 

6751
02:03:04,739 --> 02:03:06,290
level of romantic relationship from
um you know certainly presence and focus

6752
02:03:06,290 --> 02:03:06,300
um you know certainly presence and focus
 

6753
02:03:06,300 --> 02:03:08,629
um you know certainly presence and focus
you know everything from sex to

6754
02:03:08,629 --> 02:03:08,639
you know everything from sex to
 

6755
02:03:08,639 --> 02:03:10,370
you know everything from sex to
listening to

6756
02:03:10,370 --> 02:03:10,380
listening to
 

6757
02:03:10,380 --> 02:03:12,890
listening to
um to you know raising a family to

6758
02:03:12,890 --> 02:03:12,900
um to you know raising a family to
 

6759
02:03:12,900 --> 02:03:15,109
um to you know raising a family to
tending to the house

6760
02:03:15,109 --> 02:03:15,119
tending to the house
 

6761
02:03:15,119 --> 02:03:17,390
tending to the house
um and in work it's absolutely critical

6762
02:03:17,390 --> 02:03:17,400
um and in work it's absolutely critical
 

6763
02:03:17,400 --> 02:03:19,930
um and in work it's absolutely critical
so I think that those things are kind of

6764
02:03:19,930 --> 02:03:19,940
so I think that those things are kind of
 

6765
02:03:19,940 --> 02:03:22,850
so I think that those things are kind of
mirror images of the same thing and

6766
02:03:22,850 --> 02:03:22,860
mirror images of the same thing and
 

6767
02:03:22,860 --> 02:03:24,589
mirror images of the same thing and
they're both important reflections of

6768
02:03:24,589 --> 02:03:24,599
they're both important reflections of
 

6769
02:03:24,599 --> 02:03:26,510
they're both important reflections of
the other and when you start to just you

6770
02:03:26,510 --> 02:03:26,520
the other and when you start to just you
 

6771
02:03:26,520 --> 02:03:29,089
the other and when you start to just you
know when work is not going well then

6772
02:03:29,089 --> 02:03:29,099
know when work is not going well then
 

6773
02:03:29,099 --> 02:03:31,129
know when work is not going well then
the relationship the focus on

6774
02:03:31,129 --> 02:03:31,139
the relationship the focus on
 

6775
02:03:31,139 --> 02:03:33,470
the relationship the focus on
relationship can suffer and vice versa

6776
02:03:33,470 --> 02:03:33,480
relationship can suffer and vice versa
 

6777
02:03:33,480 --> 02:03:35,570
relationship can suffer and vice versa
so and it's crazy how important that is

6778
02:03:35,570 --> 02:03:35,580
so and it's crazy how important that is
 

6779
02:03:35,580 --> 02:03:36,890
so and it's crazy how important that is
oh

6780
02:03:36,890 --> 02:03:36,900
oh
 

6781
02:03:36,900 --> 02:03:39,290
oh
how incredibly

6782
02:03:39,290 --> 02:03:39,300
how incredibly
 

6783
02:03:39,300 --> 02:03:42,050
how incredibly
um uh wonderful it could be to have a

6784
02:03:42,050 --> 02:03:42,060
um uh wonderful it could be to have a
 

6785
02:03:42,060 --> 02:03:44,410
um uh wonderful it could be to have a
person in your life that kind of uh

6786
02:03:44,410 --> 02:03:44,420
person in your life that kind of uh
 

6787
02:03:44,420 --> 02:03:48,229
person in your life that kind of uh
enables that creative Focus yeah and you

6788
02:03:48,229 --> 02:03:48,239
enables that creative Focus yeah and you
 

6789
02:03:48,239 --> 02:03:51,229
enables that creative Focus yeah and you
supply the the peace and focus for their

6790
02:03:51,229 --> 02:03:51,239
supply the the peace and focus for their
 

6791
02:03:51,239 --> 02:03:53,570
supply the the peace and focus for their
Endeavors whatever those might be I mean

6792
02:03:53,570 --> 02:03:53,580
Endeavors whatever those might be I mean
 

6793
02:03:53,580 --> 02:03:55,910
Endeavors whatever those might be I mean
that that symmetry there

6794
02:03:55,910 --> 02:03:55,920
that that symmetry there
 

6795
02:03:55,920 --> 02:03:57,709
that that symmetry there
um because clearly people have different

6796
02:03:57,709 --> 02:03:57,719
um because clearly people have different
 

6797
02:03:57,719 --> 02:03:59,750
um because clearly people have different
needs and the need to just really trust

6798
02:03:59,750 --> 02:03:59,760
needs and the need to just really trust
 

6799
02:03:59,760 --> 02:04:02,030
needs and the need to just really trust
you know like when Lex is working he's

6800
02:04:02,030 --> 02:04:02,040
you know like when Lex is working he's
 

6801
02:04:02,040 --> 02:04:06,589
you know like when Lex is working he's
in his generative mode and and and I

6802
02:04:06,589 --> 02:04:06,599
in his generative mode and and and I
 

6803
02:04:06,599 --> 02:04:08,390
in his generative mode and and and I
know he's good and so then they they

6804
02:04:08,390 --> 02:04:08,400
know he's good and so then they they
 

6805
02:04:08,400 --> 02:04:11,030
know he's good and so then they they
feel sure they've contributed to that

6806
02:04:11,030 --> 02:04:11,040
feel sure they've contributed to that
 

6807
02:04:11,040 --> 02:04:13,310
feel sure they've contributed to that
but then also what you're doing is

6808
02:04:13,310 --> 02:04:13,320
but then also what you're doing is
 

6809
02:04:13,320 --> 02:04:14,810
but then also what you're doing is
supporting them in whatever way it

6810
02:04:14,810 --> 02:04:14,820
supporting them in whatever way it
 

6811
02:04:14,820 --> 02:04:16,729
supporting them in whatever way it
happens to be and I think that sometimes

6812
02:04:16,729 --> 02:04:16,739
happens to be and I think that sometimes
 

6813
02:04:16,739 --> 02:04:17,990
happens to be and I think that sometimes
you'll see that people will pair up

6814
02:04:17,990 --> 02:04:18,000
you'll see that people will pair up
 

6815
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:19,790
you'll see that people will pair up
along creative creative or Musical

6816
02:04:19,790 --> 02:04:19,800
along creative creative or Musical
 

6817
02:04:19,800 --> 02:04:21,470
along creative creative or Musical

musical or
 

6819
02:04:21,480 --> 02:04:23,870

um computer scientists but I think again

6820
02:04:23,870 --> 02:04:23,880
um computer scientists but I think again
 

6821
02:04:23,880 --> 02:04:26,450
um computer scientists but I think again
going back to this Conti episode on on

6822
02:04:26,450 --> 02:04:26,460
going back to this Conti episode on on
 

6823
02:04:26,460 --> 02:04:28,669
going back to this Conti episode on on
relationships is that the superficial

6824
02:04:28,669 --> 02:04:28,679
relationships is that the superficial
 

6825
02:04:28,679 --> 02:04:31,310
relationships is that the superficial
labels are less important it seems than

6826
02:04:31,310 --> 02:04:31,320
labels are less important it seems than
 

6827
02:04:31,320 --> 02:04:33,709
labels are less important it seems than
just the desire to create that kind of

6828
02:04:33,709 --> 02:04:33,719
just the desire to create that kind of
 

6829
02:04:33,719 --> 02:04:37,129
just the desire to create that kind of
home life in a relationship together and

6830
02:04:37,129 --> 02:04:37,139
home life in a relationship together and
 

6831
02:04:37,139 --> 02:04:40,729
home life in a relationship together and
as a consequence the the work mode and

6832
02:04:40,729 --> 02:04:40,739
as a consequence the the work mode and
 

6833
02:04:40,739 --> 02:04:42,649
as a consequence the the work mode and
for some people there both people aren't

6834
02:04:42,649 --> 02:04:42,659
for some people there both people aren't
 

6835
02:04:42,659 --> 02:04:44,570
for some people there both people aren't
working and sometimes they are but I

6836
02:04:44,570 --> 02:04:44,580
working and sometimes they are but I
 

6837
02:04:44,580 --> 02:04:45,830
working and sometimes they are but I
think that's I think that's the good

6838
02:04:45,830 --> 02:04:45,840
think that's I think that's the good
 

6839

stuff you know and and I think that's

6840
02:04:47,990 --> 02:04:48,000
stuff you know and and I think that's
 

6841
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:49,729
stuff you know and and I think that's
the big learning in all of it is that

6842
02:04:49,729 --> 02:04:49,739
the big learning in all of it is that
 

6843
02:04:49,739 --> 02:04:51,950
the big learning in all of it is that
the further along I go with each

6844
02:04:51,950 --> 02:04:51,960
the further along I go with each
 

6845
02:04:51,960 --> 02:04:53,870
the further along I go with each
birthday I guarantee you're gonna be

6846

birthday I guarantee you're gonna be
 

6847
02:04:53,880 --> 02:04:56,030

like what I want is simpler and simpler

6848
02:04:56,030 --> 02:04:56,040
like what I want is simpler and simpler
 

6849
02:04:56,040 --> 02:04:59,510
like what I want is simpler and simpler
and harder and harder to to uh create

6850
02:04:59,510 --> 02:04:59,520
and harder and harder to to uh create
 

6851
02:04:59,520 --> 02:05:02,510
and harder and harder to to uh create
but oh so worth it

6852
02:05:02,510 --> 02:05:02,520
but oh so worth it
 

6853
02:05:02,520 --> 02:05:05,510
but oh so worth it
the inner and the outer piece it's uh

6854
02:05:05,510 --> 02:05:05,520
the inner and the outer piece it's uh
 

6855
02:05:05,520 --> 02:05:08,330
the inner and the outer piece it's uh
been over two years I think

6856
02:05:08,330 --> 02:05:08,340
been over two years I think
 

6857
02:05:08,340 --> 02:05:11,390
been over two years I think
uh since Costello passed away

6858
02:05:11,390 --> 02:05:11,400
uh since Costello passed away
 

6859
02:05:11,400 --> 02:05:14,510
uh since Costello passed away
it still tears me up uh I cried about

6860
02:05:14,510 --> 02:05:14,520
it still tears me up uh I cried about
 

6861
02:05:14,520 --> 02:05:17,810
it still tears me up uh I cried about
him today I cried about him today huh

6862

him today I cried about him today huh
 

6863
02:05:17,820 --> 02:05:20,089
him today I cried about him today huh
it's it's it's it's proportional to the

6864
02:05:20,089 --> 02:05:20,099
it's it's it's it's proportional to the
 

6865
02:05:20,099 --> 02:05:20,870
it's it's it's it's proportional to the
love

6866
02:05:20,870 --> 02:05:20,880
love
 

6867
02:05:20,880 --> 02:05:22,310
love

but yeah I'll cry about it right now if
 

6869
02:05:22,320 --> 02:05:23,870

I think but it wasn't putting him down

6870
02:05:23,870 --> 02:05:23,880
I think but it wasn't putting him down
 

6871
02:05:23,880 --> 02:05:26,089
I think but it wasn't putting him down
it wasn't the act of him dying any of

6872
02:05:26,089 --> 02:05:26,099
it wasn't the act of him dying any of
 

6873
02:05:26,099 --> 02:05:27,169
it wasn't the act of him dying any of
that actually that was a beautiful

6874
02:05:27,169 --> 02:05:27,179
that actually that was a beautiful
 

6875
02:05:27,179 --> 02:05:28,790
that actually that was a beautiful
experience

6876
02:05:28,790 --> 02:05:28,800
experience
 

6877
02:05:28,800 --> 02:05:30,770
experience
um I didn't expect it to be but it was

6878
02:05:30,770 --> 02:05:30,780
um I didn't expect it to be but it was
 

6879
02:05:30,780 --> 02:05:32,390
um I didn't expect it to be but it was
in my place when I was living in Topanga

6880
02:05:32,390 --> 02:05:32,400
in my place when I was living in Topanga
 

6881
02:05:32,400 --> 02:05:33,770
in my place when I was living in Topanga
during the pandemic where we launched

6882
02:05:33,770 --> 02:05:33,780
during the pandemic where we launched
 

6883
02:05:33,780 --> 02:05:36,709
during the pandemic where we launched
the podcast and I did it at home

6884
02:05:36,709 --> 02:05:36,719
the podcast and I did it at home
 

6885
02:05:36,719 --> 02:05:39,830
the podcast and I did it at home
and he hated the Vats I did at home and

6886
02:05:39,830 --> 02:05:39,840
and he hated the Vats I did at home and
 

6887
02:05:39,840 --> 02:05:43,609
and he hated the Vats I did at home and
it was he gave out this huge

6888
02:05:43,609 --> 02:05:43,619

 

6889
02:05:43,619 --> 02:05:46,310

right at the end and I could just tell

6890
02:05:46,310 --> 02:05:46,320
right at the end and I could just tell
 

6891
02:05:46,320 --> 02:05:48,169
right at the end and I could just tell
he had been in just not a lot of pain

6892
02:05:48,169 --> 02:05:48,179
he had been in just not a lot of pain
 

6893
02:05:48,179 --> 02:05:50,270
he had been in just not a lot of pain
fortunately but he had just been working

6894
02:05:50,270 --> 02:05:50,280
fortunately but he had just been working
 

6895
02:05:50,280 --> 02:05:52,970
fortunately but he had just been working
so hard just to move at all and the

6896
02:05:52,970 --> 02:05:52,980
so hard just to move at all and the
 

6897
02:05:52,980 --> 02:05:54,770
so hard just to move at all and the
craziest thing happened like it was

6898
02:05:54,770 --> 02:05:54,780
craziest thing happened like it was
 

6899
02:05:54,780 --> 02:05:56,390
craziest thing happened like it was
unbelief I've never had an experience
