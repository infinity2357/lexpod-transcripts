00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:56,160
and you become a transcendentalist to

deal with that and so it's very very
 

483
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:57,150
deal with that and so it's very very
understandable

518
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:39,790
so do you think then people like Iran
 

519
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,550
so do you think then people like Iran
believed sort of an idea of there's a

00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,679
believed sort of an idea of there's a
objective truth so GE what's your sense

522
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:43,689
objective truth so GE what's your sense
 

523
00:10:43,689 --> 00:10:46,650
objective truth so GE what's your sense
in the philosophical well if you remove

524
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:46,660
in the philosophical well if you remove
 

525
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,420
in the philosophical well if you remove
yourself a subjective from the picture

526
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:48,430
yourself a subjective from the picture
 

527
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:49,499
yourself a subjective from the picture
you think it's possible to actually

528
00:10:49,499 --> 00:10:49,509
you think it's possible to actually
 

529
00:10:49,509 --> 00:10:52,590
you think it's possible to actually
discover ideas that are true or we just

00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:52,600
discover ideas that are true or we just

00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,660
discover ideas that are true or we just
in a measure relative concepts they're

00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:57,030
in a measure relative concepts they're
an either true nor false it's just a

an either true nor false it's just a
 

535
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,360
an either true nor false it's just a
giant mess you cannot define objective

536
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:00,370
giant mess you cannot define objective
 

537
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:01,679
giant mess you cannot define objective
truth without understanding the nature

538

truth without understanding the nature
 

539
00:11:01,689 --> 00:11:03,749
truth without understanding the nature
of truths in the first place so what

540
00:11:03,749 --> 00:11:03,759
of truths in the first place so what
 

541
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:06,150
of truths in the first place so what
does the brain mean by saying that it

542
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:06,160
does the brain mean by saying that it
 

543
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,800
does the brain mean by saying that it
covers something as truth so for

544
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:07,810
covers something as truth so for
 

545
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:10,019
covers something as truth so for
instance a model can be predictive or

546
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:10,029
instance a model can be predictive or
 

547
00:11:10,029 --> 00:11:13,290
instance a model can be predictive or
not predictive then there can be a sense

548
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:13,300
not predictive then there can be a sense
 

549
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,300
not predictive then there can be a sense
in which a mathematical statement can be

550
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:15,310
in which a mathematical statement can be
 

551
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:17,340
in which a mathematical statement can be
tool because it's defined as true under

552
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:17,350
tool because it's defined as true under
 

553
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:19,470
tool because it's defined as true under
certain conditions so it's basically a

554
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:19,480
certain conditions so it's basically a
 

555
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:23,069
certain conditions so it's basically a
particular state that a variable can

556
00:11:23,069 --> 00:11:23,079
particular state that a variable can
 

557
00:11:23,079 --> 00:11:26,069
particular state that a variable can
have an assembled game and then you can

558
00:11:26,069 --> 00:11:26,079
have an assembled game and then you can
 

559
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,960
have an assembled game and then you can
have a correspondence between systems

560
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:27,970
have a correspondence between systems
 

561
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:29,490
have a correspondence between systems
and talk about truth which is again a

562
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:29,500
and talk about truth which is again a
 

563
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,530
and talk about truth which is again a
type of model correspondence and that

564
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:31,540
type of model correspondence and that
 

565
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,120
type of model correspondence and that
also seems to be a particular kind of

566
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:33,130
also seems to be a particular kind of
 

567
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:35,340
also seems to be a particular kind of
ground rules so for instance you're

568
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:35,350
ground rules so for instance you're
 

569
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:37,129
ground rules so for instance you're
confronted with the enormity of

570
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:37,139
confronted with the enormity of
 

571
00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:39,629
confronted with the enormity of
something existing at all right that's

00:11:39,629 --> 00:11:39,639
something existing at all right that's
 

573
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:41,299
something existing at all right that's
standing when you realize something

574
00:11:41,299 --> 00:11:41,309
standing when you realize something
 

575
00:11:41,309 --> 00:11:44,549
standing when you realize something
exists rather than nothing and this

576
00:11:44,549 --> 00:11:44,559
exists rather than nothing and this
 

577
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:46,259
exists rather than nothing and this
seems to be true right there is two EPs

578
00:11:46,259 --> 00:11:46,269
seems to be true right there is two EPs
 

579
00:11:46,269 --> 00:11:48,030
seems to be true right there is two EPs
absolute truth in the fact that

580
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:48,040
absolute truth in the fact that
 

581
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,439
absolute truth in the fact that
something seems to be happening

582
00:11:49,439 --> 00:11:49,449
something seems to be happening
 

583
00:11:49,449 --> 00:11:52,110
something seems to be happening
yeah that that to me is a showstopper I

584
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:52,120
yeah that that to me is a showstopper I
 

585
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,939
yeah that that to me is a showstopper I
could just think about that idea and be

586
00:11:53,939 --> 00:11:53,949
could just think about that idea and be
 

587
00:11:53,949 --> 00:11:56,460
could just think about that idea and be
amazed by that idea for the rest of my

588
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:56,470
amazed by that idea for the rest of my
 

589
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:58,259
amazed by that idea for the rest of my
life and not go any farther because I

590
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:58,269
life and not go any farther because I

00:11:58,269 --> 00:11:59,699
life and not go any farther because I
don't even know the answer to that why

592
00:11:59,699 --> 00:11:59,709
don't even know the answer to that why
 

593
00:11:59,709 --> 00:12:01,470
don't even know the answer to that why
does anything exist at all well the

594
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:01,480
does anything exist at all well the
 

595
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,150
does anything exist at all well the
easiest answer is existence is the

596
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:03,160
easiest answer is existence is the
 

597
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,590
easiest answer is existence is the
default right so this is the lowest

598
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:04,600
default right so this is the lowest
 

599
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,939
default right so this is the lowest
number of bits that you would need to

600
00:12:05,939 --> 00:12:05,949
number of bits that you would need to
 

601
00:12:05,949 --> 00:12:08,129
number of bits that you would need to
encode this whose answer who brought the

encode this whose answer who brought the
 

603
00:12:08,139 --> 00:12:09,749
encode this whose answer who brought the
simplest answer sympathisers that

604
00:12:09,749 --> 00:12:09,759
simplest answer sympathisers that
 

605
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:10,940
simplest answer sympathisers that
existence is that if

606
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:10,950
existence is that if

existence is that if
what about non-existence I mean that

608
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:12,990
what about non-existence I mean that
 

609
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:15,560
what about non-existence I mean that
seems non-existence might not be a

610
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:15,570
seems non-existence might not be a
 

611
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:17,329
seems non-existence might not be a
meaningful notion in the sense so in

612
00:12:17,329 --> 00:12:17,339
meaningful notion in the sense so in
 

613
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:19,490
meaningful notion in the sense so in
some sense if everything that can exist

614
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:19,500
some sense if everything that can exist
 

615
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,500

existence is the superposition of all

00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:31,220
existence is the superposition of all

00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:32,100
brief step back into in today okay so we
 

679
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,860
brief step back into in today okay so we
asked ourselves when did classical

00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:45,949
this was when we ended the monarchy and
started a democracy and at this point we

started a democracy and at this point we
 

691
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:48,050
started a democracy and at this point we
basically came up with a new form of

basically came up with a new form of

the epitome of a logistic that that the
entirety the universe may be information

1274
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:36,850
entirety the universe may be information
 

1275
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,130
entirety the universe may be information
processing it consciousness the

1276
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:38,140
processing it consciousness the
 

1277
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:38,910
processing it consciousness the
intelligence might be information

1278
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:38,920
intelligence might be information
 

1279
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,980
intelligence might be information
problem so that maybe you can comment on

1280
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:40,990
problem so that maybe you can comment on
 

1281
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:43,650
problem so that maybe you can comment on
if that's if the advanced information

1282
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:43,660
if that's if the advanced information
 

1283
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:47,430
if that's if the advanced information
processing is is a limiting kind of

1284
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:47,440
processing is is a limiting kind of
 

1285
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,830
processing is is a limiting kind of
realm of ideas and then the other one is

1286
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:49,840
realm of ideas and then the other one is
 

1287
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,510

would II mean by the philosophical
 

1289
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,360
would II mean by the philosophical
project so I suspect that general

00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:54,370
project so I suspect that general

intelligence is the result of trying to
 

1293
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,930
intelligence is the result of trying to
solve general problems so intelligence I

1294
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:00,940
solve general problems so intelligence I
 

1295
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,520
solve general problems so intelligence I
think is the ability to model it's not

something many intelligent people are
 

1301
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:10,260
something many intelligent people are
bad at this but it's the ability to be

1302
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:10,270
bad at this but it's the ability to be
 

1303
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:12,090
bad at this but it's the ability to be
presented with a number of patterns and

00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:12,100
presented with a number of patterns and
 

1305
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,340
presented with a number of patterns and
see a structure in those patterns and be

some of the problems are so general that
 

1331
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:39,570
some of the problems are so general that
the system that makes them needs to

the system that makes them needs to
 

1333
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,460
the system that makes them needs to
understand what itself is and how it

understand what itself is and how it

00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:44,430
understand what itself is and how it
relates to the environment so as a child

for instance you notice you do certain

1338
00:25:46,259 --> 00:25:46,269
for instance you notice you do certain
 

1339
00:25:46,269 --> 00:25:48,870
for instance you notice you do certain
things despite you perceiving yourself

1340
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:48,880
things despite you perceiving yourself
 

1341
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,669
things despite you perceiving yourself
as wanting different things so you

1342
00:25:50,669 --> 00:25:50,679
as wanting different things so you
 

1343
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:53,399
as wanting different things so you
become aware of your own psychology you

1344
00:25:53,399 --> 00:25:53,409
become aware of your own psychology you
 

1345
00:25:53,409 --> 00:25:55,080
become aware of your own psychology you
become aware of the fact that you have

1346
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:55,090
become aware of the fact that you have
 

1347
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:57,149
become aware of the fact that you have
complex structure in yourself and you

1348
00:25:57,149 --> 00:25:57,159
complex structure in yourself and you
 

1349
00:25:57,159 --> 00:25:58,409
complex structure in yourself and you
need to model yourself to

1350
00:25:58,409 --> 00:25:58,419
need to model yourself to
 

1351
00:25:58,419 --> 00:26:00,389
need to model yourself to
reverse-engineer yourself to be able to

1352
00:26:00,389 --> 00:26:00,399
reverse-engineer yourself to be able to
 

1353
00:26:00,399 --> 00:26:02,279
reverse-engineer yourself to be able to

00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:02,289
predict how you will react to certain
 

1355
00:26:02,289 --> 00:26:03,629
predict how you will react to certain
situations and how you deal with

00:26:03,629 --> 00:26:03,639
situations and how you deal with
 

1357

environment and this process if this
 

1361
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,019

project if you reverse engineer yourself

1362
00:26:10,019 --> 00:26:10,029
project if you reverse engineer yourself
 

1363
00:26:10,029 --> 00:26:11,759

00:26:13,899 --> 00:26:16,320
nature of a universe that can continue
if you go all the way this is basically

1368
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:16,330
if you go all the way this is basically
 

1369
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:18,539
if you go all the way this is basically
the project of AI or you could say the

1370
00:26:18,539 --> 00:26:18,549
the project of AI or you could say the
 

1371
00:26:18,549 --> 00:26:20,190
the project of AI or you could say the
project of AI is a very important

1372
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:20,200
project of AI is a very important
 

1373
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,680
project of AI is a very important
component in it the tutoring test in a

1374
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:22,690
component in it the tutoring test in a
 

1375
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:25,080
component in it the tutoring test in a
way is you ask a system what is

1376
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:25,090
way is you ask a system what is
 

1377
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:27,750
way is you ask a system what is
intelligence if that system is able to

1378
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:27,760
intelligence if that system is able to
 

1379
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:32,159
intelligence if that system is able to
explain what it is how it works then you

1380
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:32,169
explain what it is how it works then you
 

1381
00:26:32,169 --> 00:26:34,049
explain what it is how it works then you
would should assign it the property of

1382
00:26:34,049 --> 00:26:34,059
would should assign it the property of
 

1383
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:35,639
would should assign it the property of
being intelligent in this general sense

1384
00:26:35,639 --> 00:26:35,649
being intelligent in this general sense
 

1385
00:26:35,649 --> 00:26:38,039
being intelligent in this general sense
so the test the Turing was administering

1386
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:38,049
so the test the Turing was administering
 

1387
00:26:38,049 --> 00:26:40,529
so the test the Turing was administering
in a way I don't think that he couldn't

1388
00:26:40,529 --> 00:26:40,539
in a way I don't think that he couldn't
 

1389
00:26:40,539 --> 00:26:42,060
in a way I don't think that he couldn't
see it but he didn't express it yet and

1390
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:42,070
see it but he didn't express it yet and
 

1391
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:45,870
see it but he didn't express it yet and
the original 1950 paper is that he was

1392
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:45,880
the original 1950 paper is that he was
 

1393
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,669
the original 1950 paper is that he was
trying to find out other that he was

1394
00:26:47,669 --> 00:26:47,679
trying to find out other that he was
 

1395
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:49,320
trying to find out other that he was
generally intelligent because in order

1396
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:49,330
generally intelligent because in order
 

1397
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:51,419
generally intelligent because in order
to take this test the wrappers of course

1398
00:26:51,419 --> 00:26:51,429
to take this test the wrappers of course
 

1399
00:26:51,429 --> 00:26:52,769
to take this test the wrappers of course
you need to be able to understand what

1400
00:26:52,769 --> 00:26:52,779
you need to be able to understand what
 

1401
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:54,509
you need to be able to understand what
that system is saying and we don't yet

1402
00:26:54,509 --> 00:26:54,519
that system is saying and we don't yet
 

1403
00:26:54,519 --> 00:26:56,129
that system is saying and we don't yet
know if we can build an AI have you

1404
00:26:56,129 --> 00:26:56,139
know if we can build an AI have you
 

1405
00:26:56,139 --> 00:26:57,750
know if we can build an AI have you
don't yet know if you are generally

1406
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:57,760
don't yet know if you are generally
 

1407
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,269
don't yet know if you are generally
intelligent basically you win the Turing

1408
00:27:00,269 --> 00:27:00,279
intelligent basically you win the Turing
 

1409
00:27:00,279 --> 00:27:04,019
intelligent basically you win the Turing
test by building an AI yes so it so in a

1410
00:27:04,019 --> 00:27:04,029
test by building an AI yes so it so in a
 

1411
00:27:04,029 --> 00:27:05,879
test by building an AI yes so it so in a
sense hidden within the Turing test is a

1412
00:27:05,879 --> 00:27:05,889
sense hidden within the Turing test is a
 

1413
00:27:05,889 --> 00:27:07,950
sense hidden within the Turing test is a
kind of recursive test yes it's a test

1414
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:07,960
kind of recursive test yes it's a test
 

1415
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,049
kind of recursive test yes it's a test
on us yeah the Turing test is basically

1416
00:27:10,049 --> 00:27:10,059
on us yeah the Turing test is basically
 

1417
00:27:10,059 --> 00:27:12,450
on us yeah the Turing test is basically
a test of the conjecture whether people

1418
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:12,460
a test of the conjecture whether people
 

1419
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,519
a test of the conjecture whether people
are intelligent enough to understand

1420
00:27:14,519 --> 00:27:14,529
are intelligent enough to understand
 

1421
00:27:14,529 --> 00:27:17,610
are intelligent enough to understand
themselves okay but you also mentioned a

1422
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:17,620
themselves okay but you also mentioned a
 

1423
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:19,500
themselves okay but you also mentioned a
little bit of a self-awareness and then

1424
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:19,510
little bit of a self-awareness and then
 

1425
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:21,810
little bit of a self-awareness and then
the project of AI do you think this kind

1426
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:21,820
the project of AI do you think this kind
 

1427
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:24,930
the project of AI do you think this kind
of emergent self-awareness is one of the

1428
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:24,940
of emergent self-awareness is one of the
 

1429
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:27,480
of emergent self-awareness is one of the
fundamental aspects of intelligence so

1430
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:27,490
fundamental aspects of intelligence so
 

1431
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:30,510
fundamental aspects of intelligence so
as opposed to goal oriented ease you

1432
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:30,520
as opposed to goal oriented ease you
 

1433
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:33,390
as opposed to goal oriented ease you
said kind of puzzle solving is

1434
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:33,400
said kind of puzzle solving is
 

1435
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,930
said kind of puzzle solving is
coming to grips with the idea that

1436
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:36,940
coming to grips with the idea that
 

1437
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:39,870
coming to grips with the idea that
you're an agent in the world and I find

1438
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:39,880
you're an agent in the world and I find
 

1439
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,310
you're an agent in the world and I find
that many highly intelligent people are

1440
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:41,320
that many highly intelligent people are
 

1441
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,520
that many highly intelligent people are
not very self-aware right so

1442
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:43,530
not very self-aware right so
 

1443
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:45,480
not very self-aware right so
self-awareness and intelligence are not

1444
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:45,490
self-awareness and intelligence are not
 

1445
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:48,060
self-awareness and intelligence are not
the same thing and you can also be surf

1446
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:48,070
the same thing and you can also be surf
 

1447
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,920
the same thing and you can also be surf
aware if you have put priors especially

1448
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:49,930
aware if you have put priors especially
 

1449
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:51,950
aware if you have put priors especially
it without being especially intelligent

1450
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:51,960
it without being especially intelligent
 

1451
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,210
it without being especially intelligent
so you don't need to be very good at

1452
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:54,220
so you don't need to be very good at
 

1453
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:56,400
so you don't need to be very good at
solving puzzles if the system that you

1454
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:56,410
solving puzzles if the system that you
 

1455
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:59,070
solving puzzles if the system that you
are already implements the solution but

1456
00:27:59,070 --> 00:27:59,080
are already implements the solution but
 

1457
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,500
are already implements the solution but
I do find intelligence so you kind of

1458
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:01,510
I do find intelligence so you kind of
 

1459
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:05,520
I do find intelligence so you kind of
mentioned children right it is that the

1460
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:05,530
mentioned children right it is that the
 

1461
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:08,910
mentioned children right it is that the
fundamental project of AI is to create

1462
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:08,920
fundamental project of AI is to create
 

1463
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:12,270
fundamental project of AI is to create
the learning system that's able to exist

1464
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:12,280
the learning system that's able to exist
 

1465
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,010
the learning system that's able to exist
in the world so you kind of drew a

1466
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:14,020
in the world so you kind of drew a
 

1467
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:16,730
in the world so you kind of drew a
difference between self-awareness and

1468
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:16,740
difference between self-awareness and
 

1469
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:20,910
difference between self-awareness and
intelligence and yet you said that the

1470
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:20,920
intelligence and yet you said that the
 

1471
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,470
intelligence and yet you said that the
self-awareness seems to be important for

1472
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:22,480
self-awareness seems to be important for
 

1473
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,530
self-awareness seems to be important for
children so I call this ability to make

1474
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:25,540
children so I call this ability to make
 

1475
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,750
children so I call this ability to make
sense of the world and your own place

1476
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:27,760
sense of the world and your own place
 

1477
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,910
sense of the world and your own place
and so to understable make you able to

1478
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:29,920
and so to understable make you able to
 

1479
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,110
and so to understable make you able to
understand what you're doing in this

1480
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:31,120
understand what you're doing in this
 

1481
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,540
understand what you're doing in this
world sentience and I would distinguish

1482
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:33,550
world sentience and I would distinguish
 

1483
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:35,370
world sentience and I would distinguish
sentience from intelligence because

1484
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:35,380
sentience from intelligence because
 

1485
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,860
sentience from intelligence because
sentience is the possessing certain

1486
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:37,870
sentience is the possessing certain
 

1487
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:40,560
sentience is the possessing certain
classes of models and intelligence is

1488
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:40,570
classes of models and intelligence is
 

1489
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:42,000
classes of models and intelligence is
the way to get to these models if you

1490
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,010
the way to get to these models if you
 

1491
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:47,820
the way to get to these models if you
don't already have them I see so can you

1492
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:47,830
don't already have them I see so can you
 

1493
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:52,290
don't already have them I see so can you
maybe pause a bit and try to answer the

1494
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:52,300
maybe pause a bit and try to answer the
 

1495
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,510
maybe pause a bit and try to answer the
question that we just said we may not be

1496
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:54,520
question that we just said we may not be
 

1497
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:57,030
question that we just said we may not be
able to answer and might be a recursive

1498
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:57,040
able to answer and might be a recursive
 

1499
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,510
able to answer and might be a recursive
meta question of what is intelligence

1500
00:28:59,510 --> 00:28:59,520
meta question of what is intelligence
 

1501
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,920
meta question of what is intelligence
and I think that intelligence is the

1502
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:01,930
and I think that intelligence is the
 

1503
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:06,000
and I think that intelligence is the
ability to make models the models is I

1504
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:06,010
ability to make models the models is I
 

1505
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:07,920
ability to make models the models is I
think it's useful as examples very

1506
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:07,930
think it's useful as examples very
 

1507
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:10,970
think it's useful as examples very
popular now neural networks form

1508
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:10,980
popular now neural networks form
 

1509
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:16,980
popular now neural networks form
representations of large-scale data set

1510
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:16,990
representations of large-scale data set
 

1511
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:19,590
representations of large-scale data set
they they form models of those data sets

1512
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:19,600
they they form models of those data sets
 

1513
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,680
they they form models of those data sets
when you say models and look at today's

1514
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:22,690
when you say models and look at today's
 

1515
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:24,450
when you say models and look at today's
new all networks what are the difference

1516
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:24,460
new all networks what are the difference
 

1517
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:26,130
new all networks what are the difference
of how you're thinking about what is

1518
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:26,140
of how you're thinking about what is
 

1519
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:29,160
of how you're thinking about what is
intelligent in saying that intelligence

1520
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:29,170
intelligent in saying that intelligence
 

1521
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:31,740
intelligent in saying that intelligence
is the process of making models two

1522
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:31,750
is the process of making models two
 

1523
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:34,800
is the process of making models two
aspects tool to this question one is the

1524
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:34,810
aspects tool to this question one is the
 

1525
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:36,300
aspects tool to this question one is the
representation is the representation

1526
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:36,310
representation is the representation
 

1527
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:38,310
representation is the representation
adequate for the domain that we want to

1528
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:38,320
adequate for the domain that we want to
 

1529
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,520
adequate for the domain that we want to
represent and the other one is is the

1530
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:41,530
represent and the other one is is the
 

1531
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,500
represent and the other one is is the
type of the model that you arrive at

1532
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:43,510
type of the model that you arrive at
 

1533
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:46,230
type of the model that you arrive at
adequate so basically are your modeling

1534
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:46,240
adequate so basically are your modeling
 

1535
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,389
adequate so basically are your modeling
the correct domain

1536
00:29:47,389 --> 00:29:47,399
the correct domain
 

1537
00:29:47,399 --> 00:29:50,509
the correct domain
and I think in both of these cases

1538
00:29:50,509 --> 00:29:50,519
and I think in both of these cases
 

1539
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:53,209
and I think in both of these cases
modern AI is lacking stuff and I think

1540
00:29:53,209 --> 00:29:53,219
modern AI is lacking stuff and I think
 

1541
00:29:53,219 --> 00:29:54,919
modern AI is lacking stuff and I think
that I'm not saying anything new you're

1542
00:29:54,919 --> 00:29:54,929
that I'm not saying anything new you're
 

1543
00:29:54,929 --> 00:29:56,839
that I'm not saying anything new you're
not criticizing the field most of the

1544
00:29:56,839 --> 00:29:56,849
not criticizing the field most of the
 

1545
00:29:56,849 --> 00:30:00,019
not criticizing the field most of the
people that design our paradigms are

1546
00:30:00,019 --> 00:30:00,029
people that design our paradigms are
 

1547
00:30:00,029 --> 00:30:03,019
people that design our paradigms are
aware of that and so one aspect that

1548
00:30:03,019 --> 00:30:03,029
aware of that and so one aspect that
 

1549
00:30:03,029 --> 00:30:05,299
aware of that and so one aspect that
you're missing is unified learning when

1550
00:30:05,299 --> 00:30:05,309
you're missing is unified learning when
 

1551
00:30:05,309 --> 00:30:07,339
you're missing is unified learning when
we learned we'd at some point discover

1552
00:30:07,339 --> 00:30:07,349
we learned we'd at some point discover
 

1553
00:30:07,349 --> 00:30:09,859
we learned we'd at some point discover
that everything that we sends this part

1554
00:30:09,859 --> 00:30:09,869
that everything that we sends this part
 

1555
00:30:09,869 --> 00:30:12,289
that everything that we sends this part
of the same object which means we learn

1556
00:30:12,289 --> 00:30:12,299
of the same object which means we learn
 

1557
00:30:12,299 --> 00:30:13,789
of the same object which means we learn
it all into one model and we call this

1558
00:30:13,789 --> 00:30:13,799
it all into one model and we call this
 

1559
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:15,859
it all into one model and we call this
model the universe so an experience of

1560
00:30:15,859 --> 00:30:15,869
model the universe so an experience of
 

1561
00:30:15,869 --> 00:30:17,269
model the universe so an experience of
the world that we are embedded on it's

1562
00:30:17,269 --> 00:30:17,279
the world that we are embedded on it's
 

1563
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,820
the world that we are embedded on it's
not a secret direct via to physical

1564
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:19,830
not a secret direct via to physical

00:30:21,479 --> 00:30:22,849
reality physical reality is a view at
quantum graph that we can never

00:30:22,849 --> 00:30:22,859
quantum graph that we can never

this properties that it can create
 

1573
00:30:27,629 --> 00:30:28,940
this properties that it can create
certain patterns at our systemic

1574
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:28,950
certain patterns at our systemic
 

1575
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:31,070
certain patterns at our systemic
interface to the world and we make sense

1576
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:31,080
interface to the world and we make sense
 

1577
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,810
interface to the world and we make sense
of these patterns and the relationship

of these patterns and the relationship
between the patterns that we discover is

1580
00:30:34,669 --> 00:30:34,679
between the patterns that we discover is
 

1581
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:36,769
between the patterns that we discover is
what we call the physical universe so at

1582
00:30:36,769 --> 00:30:36,779
what we call the physical universe so at
 

1583
00:30:36,779 --> 00:30:40,060
what we call the physical universe so at
some point in our development is a

00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:40,070
some point in our development is a
 

1585
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:42,469
some point in our development is a
nervous system we discover that

1586
00:30:42,469 --> 00:30:42,479

1587
00:30:42,479 --> 00:30:45,200
nervous system we discover that
everything that we relate to and in the

1588
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:45,210
everything that we relate to and in the
 

1589
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:47,089
everything that we relate to and in the
world it can be mapped to a region in

1590
00:30:47,089 --> 00:30:47,099
world it can be mapped to a region in
 

1591
00:30:47,099 --> 00:30:49,879
world it can be mapped to a region in
the same three-dimensional space by and

1592
00:30:49,879 --> 00:30:49,889
the same three-dimensional space by and
 

1593
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:51,619
the same three-dimensional space by and
large we now know in physics that this

1594
00:30:51,619 --> 00:30:51,629
large we now know in physics that this
 

1595
00:30:51,629 --> 00:30:53,570
large we now know in physics that this
is not quite true well it's not actually

1596
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:53,580
is not quite true well it's not actually
 

1597
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,759
is not quite true well it's not actually
three-dimensional but the world that we

1598
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:55,769
three-dimensional but the world that we
 

1599
00:30:55,769 --> 00:30:57,259
three-dimensional but the world that we
are entangled is at the level of which

1600
00:30:57,259 --> 00:30:57,269
are entangled is at the level of which
 

1601
00:30:57,269 --> 00:30:59,469
are entangled is at the level of which
we are entangled this is largely a flat

1602
00:30:59,469 --> 00:30:59,479
we are entangled this is largely a flat
 

1603
00:30:59,479 --> 00:31:02,539
we are entangled this is largely a flat
three-dimensional space and so this is

1604
00:31:02,539 --> 00:31:02,549
three-dimensional space and so this is
 

1605
00:31:02,549 --> 00:31:04,549
three-dimensional space and so this is
the model that our brain is intuitively

1606

the model that our brain is intuitively
 

1607
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:06,739
the model that our brain is intuitively
making and this is I think what gave

right and so in some sense you can

1748
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:47,280
right and so in some sense you can
 

1749
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,010
right and so in some sense you can
construct yourself functionally as a

00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:49,020
construct yourself functionally as a
 

1751
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:51,200
construct yourself functionally as a
function is implemented by brains that

1752
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:51,210
function is implemented by brains that
 

1753
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:54,049
function is implemented by brains that
exists across brains and this is a God

1754
00:33:54,049 --> 00:33:54,059
exists across brains and this is a God
 

1755
00:33:54,059 --> 00:33:56,210
exists across brains and this is a God

00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:56,220
with a small G that's one of the if you

00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:01,740
this is one of the nice features of our
 

1761
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,830
this is one of the nice features of our
brains it seems to that we can all

1767
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:10,340
got in this case and kind of share it
yes you give everybody a spec and the

00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:10,350
yes you give everybody a spec and the

00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:14,510
yes you give everybody a spec and the
mathematical constraints that are in

00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:16,889
to information-processing make sure that
 

1775
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:19,070
to information-processing make sure that
given the same spec you come up with a

given the same spec you come up with a
 

1777
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,690
given the same spec you come up with a

1778
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:20,700
compatible structure okay

so that's there's the space of ideas

1780
00:34:22,609 --> 00:34:22,619
so that's there's the space of ideas
 

1781
00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:24,109
so that's there's the space of ideas
that we all share and we think that's

that we all share and we think that's
 

1783
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:26,840
that we all share and we think that's
kind of the mind and but that's separate

00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:26,850
kind of the mind and but that's separate
 

1785
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:31,399
kind of the mind and but that's separate

quarter of the multiplayer adventure so

1796
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:42,240
quarter of the multiplayer adventure so
 

1797
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,990
quarter of the multiplayer adventure so
to speak and we are all players in this

1798
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:45,000
to speak and we are all players in this
 

1799
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,119
to speak and we are all players in this
game and that's dualism usually but it

1800
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:49,129
game and that's dualism usually but it
 

1801
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:52,639
game and that's dualism usually but it
is because the mental realm is exists in

1802
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:52,649
is because the mental realm is exists in
 

1803
00:34:52,649 --> 00:34:54,080
is because the mental realm is exists in
a different implementation than a

1804
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:54,090
a different implementation than a
 

1805
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:56,510
a different implementation than a
physical realm and the mental realm is

1806
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:56,520
physical realm and the mental realm is
 

1807
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,790
physical realm and the mental realm is
real and a lot of people have this

1808
00:34:58,790 --> 00:34:58,800
real and a lot of people have this
 

1809
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,410
real and a lot of people have this
intuition that there is this real room

1810
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:00,420
intuition that there is this real room
 

1811
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,599
intuition that there is this real room
in which you and me talk and speak right

1812
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:02,609
in which you and me talk and speak right
 

1813
00:35:02,609 --> 00:35:02,990
in which you and me talk and speak right
now

1814
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:03,000
now
 

1815
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,660
now
then comes a layer of physics and

1816
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:05,670
then comes a layer of physics and
 

1817
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:08,150
then comes a layer of physics and
abstract rules and so on and then comes

1818
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:08,160
abstract rules and so on and then comes
 

1819
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,800
abstract rules and so on and then comes
another real room where our souls are

1820
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:09,810
another real room where our souls are
 

1821
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:12,560
another real room where our souls are
and our tool form isn't the thing that

1822
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:12,570
and our tool form isn't the thing that
 

1823
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:14,120
and our tool form isn't the thing that
gives us phenomenal experience and this

1824
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:14,130
gives us phenomenal experience and this
 

1825
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:16,700
gives us phenomenal experience and this
of course a very confused notion that

1826
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:16,710
of course a very confused notion that
 

1827
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:18,859
of course a very confused notion that
you would get and it's basically it's

1828
00:35:18,859 --> 00:35:18,869
you would get and it's basically it's
 

1829
00:35:18,869 --> 00:35:22,690
you would get and it's basically it's
the result of connecting materialism and

1830
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:22,700
the result of connecting materialism and
 

1831
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:25,520
the result of connecting materialism and
idealism in the wrong way so okay I

1832
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:25,530
idealism in the wrong way so okay I
 

1833
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:27,530
idealism in the wrong way so okay I
apologize but I think it's really

1834
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:27,540
apologize but I think it's really
 

1835
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:30,590
apologize but I think it's really
helpful if we just tried to define try

1836
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:30,600
helpful if we just tried to define try
 

1837
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,510
helpful if we just tried to define try
to define terms like what is joules and

1838
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:32,520
to define terms like what is joules and
 

1839
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,280
to define terms like what is joules and
what is idealism what is materialism for

1840
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:34,290
what is idealism what is materialism for
 

1841
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:36,680
what is idealism what is materialism for
people done' so the idea of dualism and

1842
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:36,690
people done' so the idea of dualism and
 

1843
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:38,570
people done' so the idea of dualism and
our cultural tradition is that there are

1844
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:38,580
our cultural tradition is that there are
 

1845
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:41,359
our cultural tradition is that there are
two substances a mental substance and a

1846
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:41,369
two substances a mental substance and a
 

1847
00:35:41,369 --> 00:35:43,849
two substances a mental substance and a
physical substance and they interact by

1848
00:35:43,849 --> 00:35:43,859
physical substance and they interact by
 

1849
00:35:43,859 --> 00:35:46,310
physical substance and they interact by
different rules and the physical world

1850
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:46,320
different rules and the physical world
 

1851
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,800
different rules and the physical world
is basically causally closed and is

1852
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:48,810
is basically causally closed and is
 

1853
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:51,620
is basically causally closed and is
built on a low level causal structures

1854
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:51,630
built on a low level causal structures
 

1855
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:53,630
built on a low level causal structures
or the bezier bottom level that is

1856
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:53,640
or the bezier bottom level that is
 

1857
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,220
or the bezier bottom level that is
causally closed it's entirely mechanical

1858
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:55,230
causally closed it's entirely mechanical
 

1859
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:57,980
causally closed it's entirely mechanical
and mechanical in the widest sense

1860
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:57,990
and mechanical in the widest sense
 

1861
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:59,750
and mechanical in the widest sense
so it's computational there's basically

1862
00:35:59,750 --> 00:35:59,760
so it's computational there's basically
 

1863
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,040
so it's computational there's basically
a physical world in which information

1864
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:01,050
a physical world in which information
 

1865
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:03,650
a physical world in which information
flows around and physics describes the

1866
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:03,660
flows around and physics describes the
 

1867
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:06,200
flows around and physics describes the
laws of how information flows around an

1868
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:06,210
laws of how information flows around an
 

1869
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:07,730
laws of how information flows around an
adult would you compare it to like a

1870
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:07,740
adult would you compare it to like a
 

1871
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:09,859
adult would you compare it to like a
computer where you have a hardware and

1872
00:36:09,859 --> 00:36:09,869
computer where you have a hardware and
 

1873
00:36:09,869 --> 00:36:11,120
computer where you have a hardware and
software the computer is a

1874
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:11,130
software the computer is a
 

1875
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:13,190
software the computer is a
generalization of information flowing

1876
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:13,200
generalization of information flowing
 

1877
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,920
generalization of information flowing
around basically but join discovered

1878
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:15,930
around basically but join discovered
 

1879
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:17,030
around basically but join discovered
that there is genuine universal

1880
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:17,040
that there is genuine universal
 

1881
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,070
that there is genuine universal
principle you can define this Universal

1882
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:19,080
principle you can define this Universal
 

1883
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,920
principle you can define this Universal
machine that is able to perform all the

1884
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:21,930
machine that is able to perform all the
 

1885
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:24,560
machine that is able to perform all the
computations so all these machines have

1886
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:24,570
computations so all these machines have
 

1887
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:26,330
computations so all these machines have
the same power this this means that you

1888
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:26,340
the same power this this means that you
 

1889
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,980
the same power this this means that you
can always define a translation between

1890
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:27,990
can always define a translation between
 

1891
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:28,530
can always define a translation between
them

1892
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:28,540
them
 

1893
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:31,920
them
as long as they have unlimited memory to

1894
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:31,930
as long as they have unlimited memory to
 

1895
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:33,600
as long as they have unlimited memory to
be able to perform each other's

1896
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:33,610
be able to perform each other's
 

1897
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:35,460
be able to perform each other's
computations so would you then say that

1898
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:35,470
computations so would you then say that
 

1899
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:38,070
computations so would you then say that
materialism is this whole world is just

1900
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:38,080
materialism is this whole world is just
 

1901
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,290
materialism is this whole world is just
the hardware and idealism is this whole

1902
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:40,300
the hardware and idealism is this whole
 

1903
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:43,050
the hardware and idealism is this whole
world is just a software why I think

1904
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:43,060
world is just a software why I think
 

1905
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,820
world is just a software why I think
that most idealists don't have a notion

1906
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:44,830
that most idealists don't have a notion
 

1907
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:46,860
that most idealists don't have a notion
of software yet because software also

1908
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:46,870
of software yet because software also
 

1909
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:48,620
of software yet because software also
comes down to information processing

1910
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:48,630
comes down to information processing
 

1911
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:51,570
comes down to information processing
right so what you notice is the only

1912
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:51,580
right so what you notice is the only
 

1913
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:53,520
right so what you notice is the only
thing that is real to you and me is this

1914
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:53,530
thing that is real to you and me is this
 

1915
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:55,020
thing that is real to you and me is this
experimental world in which things

1916
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:55,030
experimental world in which things
 

1917
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:56,880
experimental world in which things
matter in which things have taste in

1918
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:56,890
matter in which things have taste in
 

1919
00:36:56,890 --> 00:36:59,070
matter in which things have taste in
which things of color phenomenal content

1920
00:36:59,070 --> 00:36:59,080
which things of color phenomenal content
 

1921
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,930
which things of color phenomenal content
and so on and you are bringing up

1922
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:00,940
and so on and you are bringing up
 

1923
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:03,210
and so on and you are bringing up
consciousness okay and this is distinct

1924
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:03,220
consciousness okay and this is distinct
 

1925
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:05,430
consciousness okay and this is distinct
from the physical world in which things

1926
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:05,440
from the physical world in which things
 

1927
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,950
from the physical world in which things
have values in only in an abstract sense

1928
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:07,960
have values in only in an abstract sense
 

1929
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:11,820
have values in only in an abstract sense
and you only look at cold patterns

1930
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:11,830
and you only look at cold patterns
 

1931
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:14,760
and you only look at cold patterns
moving around so how does anything feel

1932
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:14,770
moving around so how does anything feel
 

1933
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:16,440
moving around so how does anything feel
like something in this connection

1934
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:16,450
like something in this connection
 

1935
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:18,330
like something in this connection
between the two things is very puzzling

1936
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:18,340
between the two things is very puzzling
 

1937
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,950
between the two things is very puzzling
to a lot of people of course to many

1938
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:19,960
to a lot of people of course to many
 

1939
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,990
to a lot of people of course to many
philosophers so idealism starts out with

1940
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:22,000
philosophers so idealism starts out with
 

1941
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,460
philosophers so idealism starts out with
the notion that mind is primary

1942
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:23,470
the notion that mind is primary
 

1943
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:25,320
the notion that mind is primary
materialism thinks that matter is

1944
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:25,330
materialism thinks that matter is
 

1945
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:29,100
materialism thinks that matter is
primary and so for the idealist the

1946
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:29,110
primary and so for the idealist the
 

1947
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:31,350
primary and so for the idealist the
material patterns that we see a play in

1948
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:31,360
material patterns that we see a play in
 

1949
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,390
material patterns that we see a play in
playing out a part of the dream that the

1950
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:33,400
playing out a part of the dream that the
 

1951
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,900
playing out a part of the dream that the
mind is dreaming and we exist in the

1952
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:36,910
mind is dreaming and we exist in the
 

1953
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:38,670
mind is dreaming and we exist in the
mind on a higher plane of existence if

1954
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:38,680
mind on a higher plane of existence if
 

1955
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:42,570
mind on a higher plane of existence if
you want and for the materialist there

1956
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:42,580
you want and for the materialist there
 

1957
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:44,460
you want and for the materialist there
is only this material thing and that

1958
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:44,470
is only this material thing and that
 

1959
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:48,240
is only this material thing and that
generates some models and via the result

1960
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:48,250
generates some models and via the result
 

1961
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:50,280
generates some models and via the result
of these models and in some sense I

1962
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:50,290
of these models and in some sense I
 

1963
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:52,500
of these models and in some sense I
don't think that we should understand if

1964
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:52,510
don't think that we should understand if
 

1965
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:54,300
don't think that we should understand if
you understand it properly materialism

1966
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:54,310
you understand it properly materialism
 

1967
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:57,360
you understand it properly materialism
and idealism is a dichotomy but there's

1968
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:57,370
and idealism is a dichotomy but there's
 

1969
00:37:57,370 --> 00:37:59,040
and idealism is a dichotomy but there's
two different aspects of the same thing

1970
00:37:59,040 --> 00:37:59,050
two different aspects of the same thing
 

1971
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:01,560
two different aspects of the same thing
so the via thing is we don't exist in

1972
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:01,570
so the via thing is we don't exist in
 

1973
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:03,690
so the via thing is we don't exist in
the physical world we do exist inside of

1974
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:03,700
the physical world we do exist inside of
 

1975
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:06,140
the physical world we do exist inside of
a store way that the brain tells itself

1976
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:06,150
a store way that the brain tells itself
 

1977
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:10,500
a store way that the brain tells itself
ok that's it let me uh let my my my

1978
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:10,510
ok that's it let me uh let my my my
 

1979
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:13,890
ok that's it let me uh let my my my
information processing I take they take

1980
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:13,900
information processing I take they take
 

1981
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:16,020
information processing I take they take
that in we don't exist in the physical

1982
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:16,030
that in we don't exist in the physical
 

1983
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:18,480
that in we don't exist in the physical
world we exist in the narrative basic

1984
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:18,490
world we exist in the narrative basic
 

1985
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:19,860
world we exist in the narrative basic
your brain cannot feel anything

1986
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:19,870
your brain cannot feel anything
 

1987
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:21,870
your brain cannot feel anything
New York cannot feel anything they're

1988
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:21,880
New York cannot feel anything they're
 

1989
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,460
New York cannot feel anything they're
physical things physical systems are

1990
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:23,470
physical things physical systems are
 

1991
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:25,530
physical things physical systems are
unable to experience anything but it

1992
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:25,540
unable to experience anything but it
 

1993
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:27,270
unable to experience anything but it
would be very useful for the brain or

1994
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:27,280
would be very useful for the brain or
 

1995
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,740
would be very useful for the brain or
for the organism to know what it would

1996
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:28,750
for the organism to know what it would
 

1997
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:30,600
for the organism to know what it would
be like to be a person and to feel

1998
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:30,610
be like to be a person and to feel
 

1999
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:32,940
be like to be a person and to feel
something yeah so the brain creates a

2000
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:32,950
something yeah so the brain creates a
 

2001
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:35,550
something yeah so the brain creates a
simulacrum of such a person that it uses

2002
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:35,560
simulacrum of such a person that it uses
 

2003
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,050
simulacrum of such a person that it uses
to model the interactions of the

2004
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:37,060
to model the interactions of the
 

2005
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:39,060
to model the interactions of the
person's the best model of what that

2006
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:39,070
person's the best model of what that
 

2007
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:41,340
person's the best model of what that
brain this organism thinks it is in

2008
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:41,350
brain this organism thinks it is in
 

2009
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:42,450
brain this organism thinks it is in
relationship to its

2010
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:42,460
relationship to its
 

2011
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:44,339
relationship to its
and so it creates that model it's a

2012
00:38:44,339 --> 00:38:44,349
and so it creates that model it's a
 

2013
00:38:44,349 --> 00:38:46,050
and so it creates that model it's a
story a multimedia novel that the brain

2014
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:46,060
story a multimedia novel that the brain
 

2015
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:48,089
story a multimedia novel that the brain
is continuously writing and updating but

2016
00:38:48,089 --> 00:38:48,099
is continuously writing and updating but
 

2017
00:38:48,099 --> 00:38:50,550
is continuously writing and updating but
you also kind of said that you said that

2018
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:50,560
you also kind of said that you said that
 

2019
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,250
you also kind of said that you said that
we kind of exist in the head and that's

2020
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:53,260
we kind of exist in the head and that's
 

2021
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:57,030
we kind of exist in the head and that's
alright yes that story yeah what is real

2022
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:57,040
alright yes that story yeah what is real
 

2023
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:02,640
alright yes that story yeah what is real
in any of this so like there's a again

2024
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:02,650
in any of this so like there's a again
 

2025
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:05,099
in any of this so like there's a again
these terms are you kind of said there's

2026
00:39:05,099 --> 00:39:05,109
these terms are you kind of said there's
 

2027
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:07,380
these terms are you kind of said there's
a quantum graph I mean what is what is

2028
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:07,390
a quantum graph I mean what is what is
 

2029
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:09,750
a quantum graph I mean what is what is
this whole thing running on then is this

2030
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:09,760
this whole thing running on then is this
 

2031
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:13,140
this whole thing running on then is this
story and is it completely fundamentally

2032
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:13,150
story and is it completely fundamentally
 

2033
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:15,329
story and is it completely fundamentally
impossible to get access to it because

2034
00:39:15,329 --> 00:39:15,339
impossible to get access to it because
 

2035
00:39:15,339 --> 00:39:18,300
impossible to get access to it because
isn't the story supposed to is in the

2036
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:18,310
isn't the story supposed to is in the
 

2037
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:23,099
isn't the story supposed to is in the
brain in a in something in existing in

2038
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:23,109
brain in a in something in existing in
 

2039
00:39:23,109 --> 00:39:25,349
brain in a in something in existing in
some kind of context so what we can

2040
00:39:25,349 --> 00:39:25,359
some kind of context so what we can
 

2041
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:27,900
some kind of context so what we can
identify as computer scientists we can

2042
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:27,910
identify as computer scientists we can
 

2043
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:30,480
identify as computer scientists we can
engineer systems and test our theories

2044
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:30,490
engineer systems and test our theories
 

2045
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:33,960
engineer systems and test our theories
this way that may have the necessary and

2046
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:33,970
this way that may have the necessary and
 

2047
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:35,730
this way that may have the necessary and
sufficient properties to produce the

2048
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:35,740
sufficient properties to produce the
 

2049
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,800
sufficient properties to produce the
phenomena that you're observing which is

2050
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:37,810
phenomena that you're observing which is
 

2051
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:40,500
phenomena that you're observing which is
there is itself in a virtual world that

2052
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:40,510
there is itself in a virtual world that
 

2053
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:43,020
there is itself in a virtual world that
is generated in somebody's neocortex who

2054
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:43,030
is generated in somebody's neocortex who
 

2055
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:45,660
is generated in somebody's neocortex who
that is contained in the skull of this

2056
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:45,670
that is contained in the skull of this
 

2057
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:47,609

primate here and when I point at this

00:39:47,609 --> 00:39:47,619
primate here and when I point at this
 

2059
00:39:47,619 --> 00:39:50,280
primate here and when I point at this
this indexicality is of course wrong but

2060
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:50,290
this indexicality is of course wrong but
 

2061
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:52,740
this indexicality is of course wrong but
I do create something that is likely to

2062
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:52,750
I do create something that is likely to
 

2063
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:55,140
I do create something that is likely to
give rise to patterns on your retina

2064
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:55,150
give rise to patterns on your retina
 

2065
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:57,180
give rise to patterns on your retina
that allow you to interpret what I'm

2066
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:57,190
that allow you to interpret what I'm
 

2067
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:59,730
that allow you to interpret what I'm
saying right but I both know that the

2068
00:39:59,730 --> 00:39:59,740
saying right but I both know that the
 

2069
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:01,109
saying right but I both know that the
world that you and me are seeing is not

2070
00:40:01,109 --> 00:40:01,119
world that you and me are seeing is not
 

2071
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:03,359
world that you and me are seeing is not
the real physical world what we are

2072
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:03,369
the real physical world what we are
 

2073
00:40:03,369 --> 00:40:05,579
the real physical world what we are
seeing is a virtual reality generated in

2074
00:40:05,579 --> 00:40:05,589
seeing is a virtual reality generated in
 

2075
00:40:05,589 --> 00:40:07,620
seeing is a virtual reality generated in
your brain to explain the patterns on

2076
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:07,630
your brain to explain the patterns on
 

2077
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:09,359
your brain to explain the patterns on
your retina how close is it to the real

2078
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:09,369
your retina how close is it to the real
 

2079
00:40:09,369 --> 00:40:11,430
your retina how close is it to the real
world that's kind of the the question is

2080
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:11,440
world that's kind of the the question is
 

2081
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,270

00:40:59,940 --> 00:40:59,950
you paint this black and where it's
 

2121
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:03,359
you paint this black and where it's
converging you don't and you get the

00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:10,930
diverges yes right this gives you this
 

2127
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:12,930
diverges yes right this gives you this
shape of this fractal but imagine you

2128
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:12,940
shape of this fractal but imagine you
 

2129
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:14,280

right now is the spiral and the spiral

2140
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:24,250
right now is the spiral and the spiral
 

2141
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:25,710
right now is the spiral and the spiral
moves a little bit to the right is this

2142
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:25,720
moves a little bit to the right is this
 

2143
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,630
moves a little bit to the right is this
an accurate model of reality yes it is

2144
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:27,640
an accurate model of reality yes it is
 

2145
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:30,060
an accurate model of reality yes it is
right it is an adequate description is

2146
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:30,070
right it is an adequate description is
 

2147
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,980
right it is an adequate description is
you know that there is actually no

2148
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:31,990
you know that there is actually no
 

2149
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:34,050
you know that there is actually no
spiral and the mailboat fractal it only

2150
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:34,060
spiral and the mailboat fractal it only
 

2151
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:36,150
spiral and the mailboat fractal it only
appears to like this to an observer that

2152
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:36,160
appears to like this to an observer that
 

2153
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,010
appears to like this to an observer that
is interpreting things as a

2154
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:38,020
is interpreting things as a
 

2155
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:40,170
is interpreting things as a
two-dimensional space and then define

2156
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:40,180
two-dimensional space and then define
 

2157
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:41,910
two-dimensional space and then define
certain regularities in there at a

2158
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:41,920
certain regularities in there at a
 

2159
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,829
certain regularities in there at a
certain scale that currently observes

2160
00:41:43,829 --> 00:41:43,839
certain scale that currently observes
 

2161
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:45,240
certain scale that currently observes
because if you zoom in the spiral might

2162
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:45,250
because if you zoom in the spiral might
 

2163
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:46,829
because if you zoom in the spiral might
disappear and turn out to be something

2164
00:41:46,829 --> 00:41:46,839
disappear and turn out to be something
 

2165
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:48,329
disappear and turn out to be something
different at the different resolution

2166
00:41:48,329 --> 00:41:48,339
different at the different resolution
 

2167
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,280
different at the different resolution
right yes so at this level you have the

2168
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:50,290
right yes so at this level you have the
 

2169
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:51,900
right yes so at this level you have the
spiral and then you discover the spiral

2170
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:51,910
spiral and then you discover the spiral
 

2171
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:53,160
spiral and then you discover the spiral
moves to the right and some point it

2172
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:53,170
moves to the right and some point it
 

2173
00:41:53,170 --> 00:41:55,260
moves to the right and some point it
disappears so you have a singularity at

2174
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:55,270
disappears so you have a singularity at
 

2175
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:57,510
disappears so you have a singularity at
this point your model is no longer valid

2176
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:57,520
this point your model is no longer valid
 

2177
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,400
this point your model is no longer valid
you cannot predict what happens beyond

2178
00:41:59,400 --> 00:41:59,410
you cannot predict what happens beyond
 

2179
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:01,079
you cannot predict what happens beyond
the singularity but you can observe

2180
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:01,089
the singularity but you can observe
 

2181
00:42:01,089 --> 00:42:02,970
the singularity but you can observe
again and you will see it is another

2182
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:02,980
again and you will see it is another
 

2183
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:05,220
again and you will see it is another
spiral and at this point it disappeared

2184
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:05,230
spiral and at this point it disappeared
 

2185
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:06,809
spiral and at this point it disappeared
so maybe we now have a second-order law

2186
00:42:06,809 --> 00:42:06,819
so maybe we now have a second-order law
 

2187
00:42:06,819 --> 00:42:09,240
so maybe we now have a second-order law
and if you make 30 layers of these laws

2188
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:09,250
and if you make 30 layers of these laws
 

2189
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:10,980
and if you make 30 layers of these laws
then you have a description of the world

2190
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:10,990
then you have a description of the world
 

2191
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:12,809
then you have a description of the world
that is similar to the one that we come

2192
00:42:12,809 --> 00:42:12,819
that is similar to the one that we come
 

2193
00:42:12,819 --> 00:42:14,160
that is similar to the one that we come
up with when we describe the reality

2194
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:14,170
up with when we describe the reality
 

2195
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:16,530
up with when we describe the reality
around us it's reasonably predictive it

2196
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:16,540
around us it's reasonably predictive it
 

2197
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:18,780
around us it's reasonably predictive it
does not cut to the core of it so you

2198
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:18,790
does not cut to the core of it so you
 

2199
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:20,790
does not cut to the core of it so you
explain how it's being generated how it

2200
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:20,800
explain how it's being generated how it
 

2201
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,250
explain how it's being generated how it
actually works but it's relatively good

2202
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:23,260
actually works but it's relatively good
 

2203
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:24,780
actually works but it's relatively good
to explain the University of your

2204
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:24,790
to explain the University of your
 

2205
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:26,130
to explain the University of your
entangled fence but you don't think the

2206
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:26,140
entangled fence but you don't think the
 

2207
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:27,809
entangled fence but you don't think the
tools are computer sizes the tools of

00:42:31,109 --> 00:42:31,119
physics could get could step outside see
 

2211
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:33,180
physics could get could step outside see

Franklin you try to figure out what

2220
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:41,410
Franklin you try to figure out what
 

2221
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:43,170
Franklin you try to figure out what
works and you you know somehow have a

2222
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:43,180
works and you you know somehow have a
 

2223
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:44,730
works and you you know somehow have a
throwing machine there's enough memory

2224
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:44,740
throwing machine there's enough memory
 

2225
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:48,839
throwing machine there's enough memory
to think and as a result you've come to

2226
00:42:48,839 --> 00:42:48,849
to think and as a result you've come to
 

2227
00:42:48,849 --> 00:42:50,309
to think and as a result you've come to
this idea it must be some kind of

2228
00:42:50,309 --> 00:42:50,319
this idea it must be some kind of
 

2229
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:52,500
this idea it must be some kind of
automaton and maybe you just enumerate

2230
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:52,510
automaton and maybe you just enumerate
 

2231
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:54,210
automaton and maybe you just enumerate
all the possible automata until you get

2232
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:54,220
all the possible automata until you get
 

2233
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:56,609
all the possible automata until you get
to the one that produces your reality so

2234
00:42:56,609 --> 00:42:56,619
to the one that produces your reality so
 

2235
00:42:56,619 --> 00:42:58,530
to the one that produces your reality so
you can identify necessary and

2236
00:42:58,530 --> 00:42:58,540
you can identify necessary and
 

2237
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:00,210
you can identify necessary and
sufficient condition for instance we

2238
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:00,220
sufficient condition for instance we
 

2239
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:02,400
sufficient condition for instance we
discover that mathematics itself is the

2240
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:02,410
discover that mathematics itself is the
 

2241
00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:04,859
discover that mathematics itself is the
domain of all languages and then we see

2242
00:43:04,859 --> 00:43:04,869
domain of all languages and then we see
 

2243
00:43:04,869 --> 00:43:06,780
domain of all languages and then we see
that most of the domains of mathematics

2244
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:06,790
that most of the domains of mathematics
 

2245
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:08,970
that most of the domains of mathematics
that we have discovered are in some

2246
00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:08,980
that we have discovered are in some
 

2247
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:10,140
that we have discovered are in some
sense describing the same

2248
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:10,150
sense describing the same
 

2249
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:12,329
sense describing the same
this is what category theory is obsessed

2250
00:43:12,329 --> 00:43:12,339
this is what category theory is obsessed
 

2251
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:13,799
this is what category theory is obsessed
about that you can map these different

2252
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:13,809
about that you can map these different
 

2253
00:43:13,809 --> 00:43:15,539
about that you can map these different
domains to each other so they're not

2254
00:43:15,539 --> 00:43:15,549
domains to each other so they're not
 

2255
00:43:15,549 --> 00:43:17,880
domains to each other so they're not
that many fractals and some of these

2256
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:17,890
that many fractals and some of these
 

2257
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:19,799
that many fractals and some of these
have interesting structure and symmetry

2258
00:43:19,799 --> 00:43:19,809
have interesting structure and symmetry
 

2259
00:43:19,809 --> 00:43:23,400
have interesting structure and symmetry
breaks and so you can just cover what

2260
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:23,410
breaks and so you can just cover what
 

2261
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:26,010
breaks and so you can just cover what
region of this global fractal you might

2262
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:26,020
region of this global fractal you might
 

2263
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,140
region of this global fractal you might
be embedded in from first principles yes

2264
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:28,150
be embedded in from first principles yes
 

2265
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:29,519
be embedded in from first principles yes
but the only way you can get there is

2266
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:29,529
but the only way you can get there is
 

2267
00:43:29,529 --> 00:43:31,529
but the only way you can get there is
from first principles so basically your

2268
00:43:31,529 --> 00:43:31,539
from first principles so basically your
 

2269
00:43:31,539 --> 00:43:33,299
from first principles so basically your
understanding of the universe has to

2270
00:43:33,299 --> 00:43:33,309
understanding of the universe has to
 

2271
00:43:33,309 --> 00:43:34,829
understanding of the universe has to
start with automata and the number

2272
00:43:34,829 --> 00:43:34,839
start with automata and the number
 

2273
00:43:34,839 --> 00:43:37,230
start with automata and the number
theory and then spaces and so on yeah I

2274
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:37,240
theory and then spaces and so on yeah I
 

2275
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,329
theory and then spaces and so on yeah I
think like Stephen Wolfram still dreams

2276
00:43:39,329 --> 00:43:39,339
think like Stephen Wolfram still dreams
 

2277
00:43:39,339 --> 00:43:40,980
think like Stephen Wolfram still dreams
that he's it that he'll be able to

2278
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:40,990
that he's it that he'll be able to
 

2279
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:43,859
that he's it that he'll be able to
arrive at the fundamental rules of the

2280
00:43:43,859 --> 00:43:43,869
arrive at the fundamental rules of the
 

2281
00:43:43,869 --> 00:43:45,870
arrive at the fundamental rules of the
cellular automata or the generalization

2282
00:43:45,870 --> 00:43:45,880
cellular automata or the generalization
 

2283
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:48,089
cellular automata or the generalization
of which is behind our universe yeah

2284
00:43:48,089 --> 00:43:48,099
of which is behind our universe yeah
 

2285
00:43:48,099 --> 00:43:52,529
of which is behind our universe yeah
it's you've said on this topic you said

2286
00:43:52,529 --> 00:43:52,539
it's you've said on this topic you said
 

2287
00:43:52,539 --> 00:43:55,680
it's you've said on this topic you said
in a recent conversation that quote some

2288
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:55,690
in a recent conversation that quote some
 

2289
00:43:55,690 --> 00:43:57,839
in a recent conversation that quote some
people think that a simulation can't be

2290
00:43:57,839 --> 00:43:57,849
people think that a simulation can't be
 

2291
00:43:57,849 --> 00:44:00,029
people think that a simulation can't be
conscious and only a physical system can

2292
00:44:00,029 --> 00:44:00,039
conscious and only a physical system can
 

2293
00:44:00,039 --> 00:44:02,220
conscious and only a physical system can
but they got a completely backward a

2294
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:02,230
but they got a completely backward a
 

2295
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:04,710
but they got a completely backward a
physical system cannot be conscious only

2296
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:04,720
physical system cannot be conscious only
 

2297
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,960
physical system cannot be conscious only
a simulation can be cautious yeah

2298
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:06,970
a simulation can be cautious yeah
 

2299
00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:08,880
a simulation can be cautious yeah
consciousness is a simulated property

2300
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:08,890
consciousness is a simulated property
 

2301
00:44:08,890 --> 00:44:11,579
consciousness is a simulated property
that's simulate itself yeah just like

2302
00:44:11,579 --> 00:44:11,589
that's simulate itself yeah just like
 

2303
00:44:11,589 --> 00:44:14,910
that's simulate itself yeah just like
you said the mind is kind of the call it

2304
00:44:14,910 --> 00:44:14,920
you said the mind is kind of the call it
 

2305
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,400
you said the mind is kind of the call it
story narrative there's a simulation or

2306
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:17,410
story narrative there's a simulation or
 

2307
00:44:17,410 --> 00:44:19,950
story narrative there's a simulation or
our mind is essentially a simulation and

2308
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:19,960
our mind is essentially a simulation and
 

2309
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:23,519
our mind is essentially a simulation and
usually I try to use the terminology so

2310
00:44:23,519 --> 00:44:23,529
usually I try to use the terminology so
 

2311
00:44:23,529 --> 00:44:25,410
usually I try to use the terminology so
that the mind is basically a principles

2312
00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:25,420
that the mind is basically a principles
 

2313
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:27,329
that the mind is basically a principles
that produce the simulation it's the

2314
00:44:27,329 --> 00:44:27,339
that produce the simulation it's the
 

2315
00:44:27,339 --> 00:44:28,799
that produce the simulation it's the
software that is implemented by your

2316
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:28,809
software that is implemented by your
 

2317
00:44:28,809 --> 00:44:31,829
software that is implemented by your
brain and the mind is creating both the

why is that an important feature in
 

2331
00:44:44,770 --> 00:44:47,700
why is that an important feature in

00:44:58,210 --> 00:45:00,839
regulation needs of monkeys and what the
monkey has to regulate is the

2342
00:45:00,839 --> 00:45:00,849
monkey has to regulate is the
 

2343
00:45:00,849 --> 00:45:03,059
monkey has to regulate is the
relationship of an organism to an

consisting of other organisms and as a
 

2349
00:45:08,799 --> 00:45:10,559
consisting of other organisms and as a
result it basically has regulation

2350
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:10,569
result it basically has regulation
 

2351
00:45:10,569 --> 00:45:12,690
result it basically has regulation
targets that it tries to get to this

2352
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:12,700
targets that it tries to get to this
 

2353
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:14,250
targets that it tries to get to this
regulation target start with priors

2354
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:14,260
regulation target start with priors
 

2355
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:16,140
regulation target start with priors
they're basic like unconditional

2356
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:16,150
they're basic like unconditional
 

2357
00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:17,849
they're basic like unconditional
reflexes that we are more less born with

2358
00:45:17,849 --> 00:45:17,859
reflexes that we are more less born with
 

2359
00:45:17,859 --> 00:45:20,130
reflexes that we are more less born with
and then we can reverse-engineer them to

2360
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:20,140
and then we can reverse-engineer them to
 

2361
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:21,990
and then we can reverse-engineer them to
make them more consistent and then we

2362
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:22,000
make them more consistent and then we
 

2363
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,460
make them more consistent and then we
get more detailed models about how the

00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:23,470
get more detailed models about how the

00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:23,970
get more detailed models about how the

world works
 

2367
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:26,790
world works
and how to interact with it and so these

2368
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:26,800
and how to interact with it and so these
 

2369
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,670
and how to interact with it and so these
priors that you commit to are largely

2370
00:45:28,670 --> 00:45:28,680
priors that you commit to are largely
 

2371
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:31,050
priors that you commit to are largely
target values that our needs should

2372
00:45:31,050 --> 00:45:31,060
target values that our needs should
 

2373
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:33,510
target values that our needs should
approach set points and this deviation

2374
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:33,520
approach set points and this deviation
 

2375
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,480
approach set points and this deviation
to the set point creates some urge some

2376
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:36,490
to the set point creates some urge some
 

2377
00:45:36,490 --> 00:45:38,880
to the set point creates some urge some
tension and we find ourselves living

2378
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:38,890
tension and we find ourselves living
 

2379
00:45:38,890 --> 00:45:40,500
tension and we find ourselves living
inside of feedback loops right

2380
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:40,510
inside of feedback loops right
 

2381
00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:42,780
inside of feedback loops right
consciousness emerges over dimensions of

2382
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:42,790
consciousness emerges over dimensions of
 

2383
00:45:42,790 --> 00:45:44,940
consciousness emerges over dimensions of
disagreements with the universe things

2384
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:44,950
disagreements with the universe things
 

2385
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:47,250
disagreements with the universe things
that you care things are not the way

2386
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:47,260
that you care things are not the way
 

2387
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:48,960
that you care things are not the way
there should be but you need to regulate

2388
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:48,970
there should be but you need to regulate
 

2389
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:51,750
there should be but you need to regulate
and so in some sense the sense self is

2390
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:51,760
and so in some sense the sense self is
 

2391
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,520
and so in some sense the sense self is
the result of all the identifications

2392
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:53,530
the result of all the identifications
 

2393
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:55,140
the result of all the identifications
that you're having an identification is

2394
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:55,150
that you're having an identification is
 

2395
00:45:55,150 --> 00:45:56,790
that you're having an identification is
a regulation tracker that you're

2396
00:45:56,790 --> 00:45:56,800
a regulation tracker that you're
 

2397
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,590
a regulation tracker that you're
committing to it's a dimension that you

2398
00:45:58,590 --> 00:45:58,600
committing to it's a dimension that you
 

2399
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,630
committing to it's a dimension that you
care about do you think is important and

2400
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:00,640
care about do you think is important and
 

2401
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,700
care about do you think is important and
this is also what locks you in if you

2402
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:02,710
this is also what locks you in if you
 

2403
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:05,520
this is also what locks you in if you
let go of these commitments of these

2404
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:05,530
let go of these commitments of these
 

2405
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:08,130
let go of these commitments of these
identifications you get free there's

2406
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:08,140
identifications you get free there's
 

2407
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:09,630
identifications you get free there's
nothing that you have to do anymore and

2408
00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:09,640
nothing that you have to do anymore and
 

2409
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:11,670
nothing that you have to do anymore and
if you let go of all of them you're

2410
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:11,680
if you let go of all of them you're
 

2411
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:12,960
if you let go of all of them you're
completely free and you can enter

00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:12,970
completely free and you can enter

your work I wanted to give him a shout

2422
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:23,980
your work I wanted to give him a shout
 

2423
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:27,359
your work I wanted to give him a shout
out he's a brilliant guy and I think the

2424
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:27,369
out he's a brilliant guy and I think the
 

2425
00:46:27,369 --> 00:46:29,070
out he's a brilliant guy and I think the
AI community is actually quite amazing

2426
00:46:29,070 --> 00:46:29,080
AI community is actually quite amazing
 

2427
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:30,870
AI community is actually quite amazing
and Gustav is a good representative that

2428
00:46:30,870 --> 00:46:30,880
and Gustav is a good representative that
 

2429
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,780
and Gustav is a good representative that
you are as well some I'm glad first of

2430
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:33,790
you are as well some I'm glad first of
 

2431
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:35,220
you are as well some I'm glad first of
all I'm glad the internet exists you -

2432
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:35,230
all I'm glad the internet exists you -
 

2433
00:46:35,230 --> 00:46:38,099
all I'm glad the internet exists you -
who's this where I can watch your talks

2434
00:46:38,099 --> 00:46:38,109
who's this where I can watch your talks
 

2435
00:46:38,109 --> 00:46:40,830
who's this where I can watch your talks
and then get to your book and study your

2436
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:40,840
and then get to your book and study your
 

2437
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,930
and then get to your book and study your
writing and think about you know that's

2438
00:46:42,930 --> 00:46:42,940
writing and think about you know that's
 

2439
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:43,950
writing and think about you know that's
that's amazing okay

2440
00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:43,960
that's amazing okay
 

2441
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:47,099
that's amazing okay
but the you've kind of described instead

2442
00:46:47,099 --> 00:46:47,109
but the you've kind of described instead
 

2443
00:46:47,109 --> 00:46:48,750
but the you've kind of described instead
of this emergent phenomena of

2444
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:48,760
of this emergent phenomena of
 

2445
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:51,870
of this emergent phenomena of
consciousness from the simulation so

2446
00:46:51,870 --> 00:46:51,880
consciousness from the simulation so
 

2447
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:53,220
consciousness from the simulation so
what about the hard problem of

2448
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:53,230
what about the hard problem of
 

2449
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:56,220
what about the hard problem of
consciousness the can you just linger on

2450
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:56,230
consciousness the can you just linger on
 

2451
00:46:56,230 --> 00:47:02,010
consciousness the can you just linger on
it like but why this is still feel like

2452
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:02,020
it like but why this is still feel like
 

2453
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:04,260
it like but why this is still feel like
I understand you're kind of the self is

2454
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:04,270
I understand you're kind of the self is
 

2455
00:47:04,270 --> 00:47:07,800
I understand you're kind of the self is
an important part of the simulation but

2456
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:07,810
an important part of the simulation but
 

2457
00:47:07,810 --> 00:47:09,270
an important part of the simulation but
why does the simulation feel like

2458
00:47:09,270 --> 00:47:09,280
why does the simulation feel like
 

2459
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:12,930
why does the simulation feel like
something so if you look at the book by

2460
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:12,940
something so if you look at the book by
 

2461
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:14,910
something so if you look at the book by
say george RR martin with the characters

2462
00:47:14,910 --> 00:47:14,920
say george RR martin with the characters
 

2463
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:17,010
say george RR martin with the characters
have plausible psychology yeah and they

2464
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:17,020
have plausible psychology yeah and they
 

2465
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:18,960
have plausible psychology yeah and they
stand on a hill because they want to

2466
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:18,970
stand on a hill because they want to
 

2467
00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:20,340
stand on a hill because they want to
conquer the city below the hill and

2468
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:20,350
conquer the city below the hill and
 

2469
00:47:20,350 --> 00:47:21,540
conquer the city below the hill and
they've done in it and then look at the

2470
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:21,550
they've done in it and then look at the
 

2471
00:47:21,550 --> 00:47:23,580
they've done in it and then look at the
color of the sky and they are Princip

2472
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:23,590
color of the sky and they are Princip
 

2473
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:26,190
color of the sky and they are Princip
and feel empowered and all these things

2474
00:47:26,190 --> 00:47:26,200
and feel empowered and all these things
 

2475
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:27,570
and feel empowered and all these things
why do they have these emotions it's

2476
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:27,580
why do they have these emotions it's
 

2477
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:28,830
why do they have these emotions it's
because it's written into the story

2478
00:47:28,830 --> 00:47:28,840
because it's written into the story
 

2479
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:30,570
because it's written into the story
right and threatened with the story

2480
00:47:30,570 --> 00:47:30,580
right and threatened with the story
 

2481
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:32,160
right and threatened with the story
because it's an adequate model of the

2482
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:32,170
because it's an adequate model of the
 

2483
00:47:32,170 --> 00:47:33,660
because it's an adequate model of the
person that predicts what they're going

2484
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:33,670
person that predicts what they're going
 

2485
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:35,030
person that predicts what they're going
to do next

2486
00:47:35,030 --> 00:47:35,040
to do next
 

2487
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,760
to do next
and the same thing is helpful it's

2488
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:37,770
and the same thing is helpful it's
 

2489
00:47:37,770 --> 00:47:39,170
and the same thing is helpful it's
basically a story that our brain is

2490
00:47:39,170 --> 00:47:39,180
basically a story that our brain is
 

2491
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:41,150
basically a story that our brain is
writing it's not written in words it's

2492
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:41,160
writing it's not written in words it's
 

2493
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:44,360
writing it's not written in words it's
written in perceptual content basically

2494
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:44,370
written in perceptual content basically
 

2495
00:47:44,370 --> 00:47:47,210
written in perceptual content basically
multimedia content and it's a model of

2496
00:47:47,210 --> 00:47:47,220
multimedia content and it's a model of
 

2497
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:49,810
multimedia content and it's a model of
what the person would feel if it existed

2498
00:47:49,810 --> 00:47:49,820
what the person would feel if it existed
 

2499
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:53,360
what the person would feel if it existed
so it's a virtual person and you and me

2500
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:53,370
so it's a virtual person and you and me
 

2501
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:55,100
so it's a virtual person and you and me
happen to be this virtual person so if

2502
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:55,110
happen to be this virtual person so if
 

2503
00:47:55,110 --> 00:47:57,020
happen to be this virtual person so if
this virtual person gets access to the

2504
00:47:57,020 --> 00:47:57,030
this virtual person gets access to the
 

2505
00:47:57,030 --> 00:47:59,240
this virtual person gets access to the
language center and talks about the sky

2506
00:47:59,240 --> 00:47:59,250
language center and talks about the sky
 

2507
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:02,390
language center and talks about the sky
being blue and this is us but hold on a

2508
00:48:02,390 --> 00:48:02,400
being blue and this is us but hold on a
 

2509
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:07,070
being blue and this is us but hold on a
second do I exist in your simulation you

2510
00:48:07,070 --> 00:48:07,080
second do I exist in your simulation you
 

2511
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:09,470
second do I exist in your simulation you
do exist even almost similar way as me

2512
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:09,480
do exist even almost similar way as me
 

2513
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:12,830
do exist even almost similar way as me
so there are internal states that I that

2514
00:48:12,830 --> 00:48:12,840
so there are internal states that I that
 

2515
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:16,850
so there are internal states that I that
are less accessible for me in that you

2516
00:48:16,850 --> 00:48:16,860
are less accessible for me in that you
 

2517
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:19,250
are less accessible for me in that you
have and so on and you're my model might

2518
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:19,260
have and so on and you're my model might
 

2519
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:21,020
have and so on and you're my model might
not be completely adequate there are

2520
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:21,030
not be completely adequate there are
 

2521
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:22,430
not be completely adequate there are
also things that I might perceive about

2522
00:48:22,430 --> 00:48:22,440
also things that I might perceive about
 

2523
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:24,530
also things that I might perceive about
you that you don't perceive but in some

2524
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:24,540
you that you don't perceive but in some
 

2525
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:27,080
you that you don't perceive but in some
sense both you and me are some puppets -

2526
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:27,090
sense both you and me are some puppets -
 

2527
00:48:27,090 --> 00:48:29,780
sense both you and me are some puppets -
puppets that enact this play in my mind

2528
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:29,790
puppets that enact this play in my mind
 

2529
00:48:29,790 --> 00:48:32,510
puppets that enact this play in my mind
and I identify with one of them because

2530
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:32,520
and I identify with one of them because
 

2531
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:34,130
and I identify with one of them because
I can't control one of the puppet

2532
00:48:34,130 --> 00:48:34,140
I can't control one of the puppet
 

2533
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:36,560
I can't control one of the puppet
directly and with the other one I can

2534
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:36,570
directly and with the other one I can
 

2535
00:48:36,570 --> 00:48:39,290
directly and with the other one I can
create things in between so for instance

2536
00:48:39,290 --> 00:48:39,300
create things in between so for instance
 

2537
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:41,090
create things in between so for instance
we can go or in an interaction that even

2538
00:48:41,090 --> 00:48:41,100
we can go or in an interaction that even
 

2539
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:43,070
we can go or in an interaction that even
leads to a coupling to a feedback loop

2540
00:48:43,070 --> 00:48:43,080
leads to a coupling to a feedback loop
 

2541
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:45,410
leads to a coupling to a feedback loop
so we can sync things together in a

2542
00:48:45,410 --> 00:48:45,420
so we can sync things together in a
 

2543
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:47,360
so we can sync things together in a
certain way or feel things together but

2544
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:47,370
certain way or feel things together but
 

2545
00:48:47,370 --> 00:48:49,580
certain way or feel things together but
this coupling is itself not a physical

2546
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:49,590
this coupling is itself not a physical
 

2547
00:48:49,590 --> 00:48:51,530
this coupling is itself not a physical
phenomena entirely a software phenomenon

2548
00:48:51,530 --> 00:48:51,540
phenomena entirely a software phenomenon
 

2549
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:53,240
phenomena entirely a software phenomenon
it's a result of two different

2550
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:53,250
it's a result of two different
 

2551
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:54,680
it's a result of two different
implementations interacting with each

2552
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:54,690
implementations interacting with each
 

2553
00:48:54,690 --> 00:48:57,560
implementations interacting with each
other so this is thing so are you

2554
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:57,570
other so this is thing so are you
 

2555
00:48:57,570 --> 00:48:59,630
other so this is thing so are you
suggesting I did like the way you think

2556
00:48:59,630 --> 00:48:59,640
suggesting I did like the way you think
 

2557
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:02,930
suggesting I did like the way you think
about it is the entirety of existence

2558
00:49:02,930 --> 00:49:02,940
about it is the entirety of existence
 

2559
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:05,630
about it is the entirety of existence
simulation and we're kind of each mind

2560
00:49:05,630 --> 00:49:05,640
simulation and we're kind of each mind
 

2561
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:10,820
simulation and we're kind of each mind
is a little sub simulation that like why

2562
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:10,830
is a little sub simulation that like why
 

2563
00:49:10,830 --> 00:49:13,520
is a little sub simulation that like why
don't you why doesn't your mind have

2564
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:13,530
don't you why doesn't your mind have
 

2565
00:49:13,530 --> 00:49:20,000
don't you why doesn't your mind have
access to my mind's full state like for

2566
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:20,010
access to my mind's full state like for
 

2567
00:49:20,010 --> 00:49:21,710
access to my mind's full state like for
the same reason that my mind hasn't have

2568
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:21,720
the same reason that my mind hasn't have
 

2569
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:25,510
the same reason that my mind hasn't have
access to its own full state so what I

2570
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:25,520
access to its own full state so what I
 

2571
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:26,720
access to its own full state so what I
mean

2572
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:26,730
mean
 

2573
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:28,760
mean
there is no trick involved so basically

2574
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:28,770
there is no trick involved so basically
 

2575
00:49:28,770 --> 00:49:30,200
there is no trick involved so basically
when I say know something about myself

2576
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:30,210
when I say know something about myself
 

2577
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:32,930
when I say know something about myself
it's because I made a model yes of your

2578
00:49:32,930 --> 00:49:32,940
it's because I made a model yes of your
 

2579
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:34,430
it's because I made a model yes of your
brain is tasked with modeling what other

2580
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:34,440
brain is tasked with modeling what other
 

2581
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:37,100
brain is tasked with modeling what other
parts of your brain are doing yes but

2582
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:37,110
parts of your brain are doing yes but
 

2583
00:49:37,110 --> 00:49:38,690
parts of your brain are doing yes but
there seems to be an incredible

2584
00:49:38,690 --> 00:49:38,700
there seems to be an incredible
 

2585
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:41,270
there seems to be an incredible
consistency about this world in the

2586
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:41,280
consistency about this world in the
 

2587
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,010
consistency about this world in the
physical sense that is repeatable

2588
00:49:43,010 --> 00:49:43,020
physical sense that is repeatable
 

2589
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:45,320
physical sense that is repeatable
experiments and so on yeah how does that

2590
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:45,330
experiments and so on yeah how does that
 

2591
00:49:45,330 --> 00:49:48,590
experiments and so on yeah how does that
fit into our silly the center of apes

2592
00:49:48,590 --> 00:49:48,600
fit into our silly the center of apes
 

2593
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:49,280
fit into our silly the center of apes
sim you

2594
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:49,290
sim you
 

2595
00:49:49,290 --> 00:49:51,560
sim you
of the world so why is it some repeat

2596
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:51,570
of the world so why is it some repeat
 

2597
00:49:51,570 --> 00:49:53,810
of the world so why is it some repeat
why is everything so repeatable and not

2598
00:49:53,810 --> 00:49:53,820
why is everything so repeatable and not
 

2599
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:56,030
why is everything so repeatable and not
everything there's a lot of fundamental

2600
00:49:56,030 --> 00:49:56,040
everything there's a lot of fundamental
 

2601
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:58,900
everything there's a lot of fundamental
physics experiments that are repeatable

2602
00:49:58,900 --> 00:49:58,910
physics experiments that are repeatable
 

2603
00:49:58,910 --> 00:50:02,300
physics experiments that are repeatable
for a long time all over the place and

2604
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:02,310
for a long time all over the place and
 

2605
00:50:02,310 --> 00:50:02,810
for a long time all over the place and
so on

2606
00:50:02,810 --> 00:50:02,820
so on
 

2607
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:05,330
so on
laws of physics how does that fit in it

2608
00:50:05,330 --> 00:50:05,340
laws of physics how does that fit in it
 

2609
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:07,160
laws of physics how does that fit in it
seems that the parts of the world that

2610
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:07,170
seems that the parts of the world that
 

2611
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:09,620
seems that the parts of the world that
are not deterministic are not long-lived

2612
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:09,630
are not deterministic are not long-lived
 

2613
00:50:09,630 --> 00:50:13,270
are not deterministic are not long-lived
so if you build a system any kind of

2614
00:50:13,270 --> 00:50:13,280
so if you build a system any kind of
 

2615
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:16,400
so if you build a system any kind of
automaton so if you build simulations of

2616
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:16,410
automaton so if you build simulations of
 

2617
00:50:16,410 --> 00:50:18,800
automaton so if you build simulations of
something you'll notice that the

2618
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:18,810
something you'll notice that the
 

2619
00:50:18,810 --> 00:50:21,050
something you'll notice that the
phenomena that endure are those that

2620
00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:21,060
phenomena that endure are those that
 

2621
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:23,810
phenomena that endure are those that
give rise to stable dynamics so

2622
00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:23,820
give rise to stable dynamics so
 

2623
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:25,130
give rise to stable dynamics so
basically if you see anything that is

2624
00:50:25,130 --> 00:50:25,140
basically if you see anything that is
 

2625
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:27,110
basically if you see anything that is
complex in the world it's the result of

2626
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:27,120
complex in the world it's the result of
 

2627
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:29,390
complex in the world it's the result of
usually of some control of some feedback

2628
00:50:29,390 --> 00:50:29,400
usually of some control of some feedback
 

2629
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:31,040
usually of some control of some feedback
that keeps it stable around certain

2630
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:31,050
that keeps it stable around certain
 

2631
00:50:31,050 --> 00:50:33,020
that keeps it stable around certain
attractors and the things that are not

2632
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:33,030
attractors and the things that are not
 

2633
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:34,910
attractors and the things that are not
stable that don't give rise to certain

2634
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:34,920
stable that don't give rise to certain
 

2635
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:37,160
stable that don't give rise to certain
harmonic patterns and so on they tend to

2636
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:37,170
harmonic patterns and so on they tend to
 

2637
00:50:37,170 --> 00:50:41,360
harmonic patterns and so on they tend to
get weeded out over time so if we are in

2638
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:41,370
get weeded out over time so if we are in
 

2639
00:50:41,370 --> 00:50:43,220
get weeded out over time so if we are in
a region of the universe that sustains

2640
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:43,230
a region of the universe that sustains
 

2641
00:50:43,230 --> 00:50:45,260
a region of the universe that sustains
complexity which is required to

2642
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:45,270
complexity which is required to
 

2643
00:50:45,270 --> 00:50:48,380
complexity which is required to
implement Minds like ours this is going

2644
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:48,390
implement Minds like ours this is going
 

2645
00:50:48,390 --> 00:50:49,940
implement Minds like ours this is going
to be a region of the universe that is

2646
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:49,950
to be a region of the universe that is
 

2647
00:50:49,950 --> 00:50:52,190
to be a region of the universe that is
very tightly controlled and controllable

2648
00:50:52,190 --> 00:50:52,200
very tightly controlled and controllable
 

2649
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:54,260
very tightly controlled and controllable
so it's going to have lots of

2650
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:54,270
so it's going to have lots of
 

2651
00:50:54,270 --> 00:50:56,240
so it's going to have lots of
interesting symmetries and also symmetry

2652
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:56,250
interesting symmetries and also symmetry
 

2653
00:50:56,250 --> 00:50:58,850
interesting symmetries and also symmetry
breaks that allow the creation of

2654
00:50:58,850 --> 00:50:58,860
breaks that allow the creation of
 

2655
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:02,240
breaks that allow the creation of
structure but they exist where so

2656
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:02,250
structure but they exist where so
 

2657
00:51:02,250 --> 00:51:04,040
structure but they exist where so
there's such an interesting idea that

2658
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:04,050
there's such an interesting idea that
 

2659
00:51:04,050 --> 00:51:05,930
there's such an interesting idea that
our - simulation is constructing the

00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:05,940
our - simulation is constructing the
 

2661
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:10,370
our - simulation is constructing the
narrative but my question is just to try

2662
00:51:10,370 --> 00:51:10,380
narrative but my question is just to try
 

2663
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:13,490
narrative but my question is just to try
to understand how that fits with this

2664
00:51:13,490 --> 00:51:13,500
to understand how that fits with this
 

2665
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:15,590
to understand how that fits with this
with the entirety of the universe you're

2666
00:51:15,590 --> 00:51:15,600
with the entirety of the universe you're
 

2667
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:17,330
with the entirety of the universe you're
saying that there's a region of this

2668
00:51:17,330 --> 00:51:17,340
saying that there's a region of this
 

2669
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:19,310
saying that there's a region of this
universe that allows enough complexity

2670
00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:19,320
universe that allows enough complexity
 

2671
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:21,230
universe that allows enough complexity
to create creatures like us but what's

2672
00:51:21,230 --> 00:51:21,240
to create creatures like us but what's
 

2673
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:25,460
to create creatures like us but what's
the connection between the the brain the

2674
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:25,470
the connection between the the brain the
 

2675
00:51:25,470 --> 00:51:28,310
the connection between the the brain the
mind and the broader universe which

2676
00:51:28,310 --> 00:51:28,320
mind and the broader universe which
 

2677
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,320
mind and the broader universe which
comes first which is more fundamental is

2678
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:30,330
comes first which is more fundamental is
 

2679
00:51:30,330 --> 00:51:32,930
comes first which is more fundamental is
the is the mind the starting point the

think quite clearly the letter it's at

2686
00:51:40,310 --> 00:51:40,320
think quite clearly the letter it's at
 

2687
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:41,960
think quite clearly the letter it's at
least a much easier explanation because

2688
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:41,970
least a much easier explanation because
 

2689
00:51:41,970 --> 00:51:44,450
least a much easier explanation because
it allows us to make causal models and I

2690
00:51:44,450 --> 00:51:44,460
it allows us to make causal models and I
 

2691
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:46,340
it allows us to make causal models and I
don't see any way to construct an

00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:46,350
don't see any way to construct an
 

2693
00:51:46,350 --> 00:51:48,410
don't see any way to construct an
inverse cos allottee so what happens

2694
00:51:48,410 --> 00:51:48,420
inverse cos allottee so what happens
 

2695
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:52,010
inverse cos allottee so what happens
when you die to your mind simulation my

when you die to your mind simulation my

when you die to your mind simulation my
implementation ceases so basically the

2698
00:51:54,530 --> 00:51:54,540
implementation ceases so basically the
 

2699
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:56,420
implementation ceases so basically the
thing that implements myself will no

2700
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:56,430
thing that implements myself will no
 

2701

to think that I identify this

2706
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:02,370
to think that I identify this
 

2707
00:52:02,370 --> 00:52:04,700
to think that I identify this
is the weird thing is I don't actually

2708
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:04,710
is the weird thing is I don't actually
 

2709
00:52:04,710 --> 00:52:07,400
is the weird thing is I don't actually
have an identity beyond the identity

2710
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:07,410

he identifies as a form of government so

2714
00:52:13,310 --> 00:52:13,320
he identifies as a form of government so
 

2715
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:15,590
he identifies as a form of government so
basically the dad Adama gets reborn not

2716
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:15,600
basically the dad Adama gets reborn not
 

2717
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:18,800
basically the dad Adama gets reborn not
because he is confused but because he is

2718
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:18,810
because he is confused but because he is
 

2719
00:52:18,810 --> 00:52:22,220
because he is confused but because he is
not identifying as a human being he runs

2720
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:22,230
not identifying as a human being he runs
 

2721
00:52:22,230 --> 00:52:23,960

you so his advisors will pick someone

2728
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:30,330
you so his advisors will pick someone
 

2729
00:52:30,330 --> 00:52:32,270
you so his advisors will pick someone
who does this in the next generation so

2730
00:52:32,270 --> 00:52:32,280
who does this in the next generation so

00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:36,680
if you identify as this you are no
longer human and you don't die and

2734
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:36,690
longer human and you don't die and
 

2735
00:52:36,690 --> 00:52:38,780
longer human and you don't die and
essentially what dies is only the body

00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:38,790
essentially what dies is only the body

2739
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:42,560
of the human that you ran on here to
kill the Dalai Lama you would have to

2740
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:42,570
kill the Dalai Lama you would have to
 

2741
00:52:42,570 --> 00:52:45,500
kill the Dalai Lama you would have to
kill his tradition and if we look at

2742
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:45,510
kill his tradition and if we look at
 

2743
00:52:45,510 --> 00:52:47,510
kill his tradition and if we look at
ourselves we realized that we are to a

2744

ourselves we realized that we are to a

small part like this most of us so for

instance if you have children you
 

2749
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:53,540

Jascha Bach is just a collection of
 

2765
00:53:08,970 --> 00:53:11,420
Jascha Bach is just a collection of
ideas so like you have this operating

it's not physically real identity is not
a physical concept it's basically a

00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:30,620
a physical concept it's basically a

it's what's the fundamental thing is
 

2789
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:42,350
it's what's the fundamental thing is
that the ideas that come together to

that the ideas that come together to

00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:44,570
that the ideas that come together to
form identity or is each individual

00:53:48,090 --> 00:53:50,090
it's a representation that you can get
agency over if you care so basically you

2798
00:53:50,090 --> 00:53:50,100
agency over if you care so basically you
 

2799
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:52,370
agency over if you care so basically you
can choose what you identify best if you

can choose what you identify best if you
 

2801

can choose what you identify best if you
want to nobody just seems if if the mind

want to nobody just seems if if the mind
 

2803
00:53:56,520 --> 00:54:01,160
want to nobody just seems if if the mind
is not very real it's not that the the

00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:01,170
is not very real it's not that the the
 

2805
00:54:01,170 --> 00:54:04,640
is not very real it's not that the the

well maybe I'm silly

00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:09,410
well maybe I'm silly
 

2811
00:54:09,410 --> 00:54:12,230
well maybe I'm silly
maybe I'm attached to this whole

00:54:12,230 --> 00:54:12,240
maybe I'm attached to this whole
 

2813
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:15,990
maybe I'm attached to this whole
biological organism but it's

2814
00:54:15,990 --> 00:54:16,000
biological organism but it's
 

2815
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,940
biological organism but it's
that the physical being a physical

00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:17,950
that the physical being a physical
 

2817

object in this world is is a an
 

2819
00:54:21,370 --> 00:54:24,150
object in this world is is a an
important aspect of birth and death like

2820
00:54:24,150 --> 00:54:24,160
important aspect of birth and death like
 

2821
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,710
important aspect of birth and death like
it feels like it has to be physical to

it feels like it has to be physical to
 

2823
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:28,680
it feels like it has to be physical to
die it feels like simulations don't have

2825
00:54:28,690 --> 00:54:31,800

00:54:35,610 --> 00:54:35,620
color and sound in the real world color
 

2831
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:37,680
color and sound in the real world color
and sound are types of representations

and sound are types of representations
 

2833
00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:40,140
and sound are types of representations
that you get if you want to model

2834
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:40,150
that you get if you want to model
 

2835
00:54:40,150 --> 00:54:42,030
that you get if you want to model
reality with oscillators right so colors

00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:42,040
reality with oscillators right so colors
 

2837
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:44,430
reality with oscillators right so colors
and sound in some sense have octaves yes

2838
00:54:44,430 --> 00:54:44,440
and sound in some sense have octaves yes
 

2839
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:46,020
and sound in some sense have octaves yes
and it's because they are represented

2840
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:46,030
and it's because they are represented
 

2841
00:54:46,030 --> 00:54:47,700
and it's because they are represented
probably with oscillators right so

00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:47,710
probably with oscillators right so
 

2843
00:54:47,710 --> 00:54:50,190
probably with oscillators right so
that's why colors form a circle of views

2844
00:54:50,190 --> 00:54:50,200
that's why colors form a circle of views
 

2845
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:52,800
that's why colors form a circle of views
and colors have harmonic sounds have

2846
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:52,810
and colors have harmonic sounds have
 

2847
00:54:52,810 --> 00:54:54,720
and colors have harmonic sounds have
harmonics is a result of synchronizing

2848
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:54,730
harmonics is a result of synchronizing
 

2849
00:54:54,730 --> 00:54:57,600
harmonics is a result of synchronizing
oscillators in in the brain right so the

00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:57,610
oscillators in in the brain right so the
 

2851
00:54:57,610 --> 00:54:59,640
oscillators in in the brain right so the

too many parts to count right so when

2870
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:18,190
too many parts to count right so when
 

2871
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:19,710
too many parts to count right so when
you look at this table and so on it's

2872
00:55:19,710 --> 00:55:19,720
you look at this table and so on it's
 

2873
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:22,140
you look at this table and so on it's
consisting of so many more molecules and

00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:22,150
consisting of so many more molecules and
 

2875
00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:24,180
consisting of so many more molecules and
atoms that you cannot count them so you

2876
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:24,190
atoms that you cannot count them so you
 

2877
00:55:24,190 --> 00:55:26,130
atoms that you cannot count them so you
only look at the aggregate dynamics at

2878
00:55:26,130 --> 00:55:26,140
only look at the aggregate dynamics at
 

2879
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:28,530
only look at the aggregate dynamics at
limit dynamics if you had almost

infinitely many patterns of particles
 

2883
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:33,030
infinitely many patterns of particles
what would be the dynamics of the table

2884
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:33,040
what would be the dynamics of the table
 

2885
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,410
what would be the dynamics of the table
and this is roughly what you get so

2886
00:55:34,410 --> 00:55:34,420
and this is roughly what you get so
 

2887
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:36,390
and this is roughly what you get so

00:55:42,570 --> 00:55:42,580
you get by building an infinite series
 

2895
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:44,820
you get by building an infinite series

or a dozen convergence chaos right and
 

2901
00:55:49,510 --> 00:55:51,060
or a dozen convergence chaos right and
then so all that is filtered through

2902
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:51,070
then so all that is filtered through
 

2903
00:55:51,070 --> 00:55:53,460
then so all that is filtered through

2911
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:04,830

00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:28,230
lot of these weights basically the error
is piped backwards into the system until

00:57:28,230 --> 00:57:28,240
is piped backwards into the system until
 

2983
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:30,030

00:57:34,390 --> 00:57:35,670
out statistically and only at these
junctures this is where you had the

junctures this is where you had the
 

2991
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:37,440
junctures this is where you had the
actual error in the network you make the

actual error in the network you make the
 

2993
00:57:37,450 --> 00:57:38,940

all right so it's this thing that I'm

3063
00:58:51,459 --> 00:58:53,009
daydream or am I still paying attention
to my percept so you have to

3064
00:58:53,009 --> 00:58:53,019
to my percept so you have to
 

3065
00:58:53,019 --> 00:58:55,499
to my percept so you have to
periodically go back and see whether you

3066

periodically go back and see whether you
 

3067
00:58:55,509 --> 00:58:57,089
periodically go back and see whether you
are still paying attention and if you

3068
00:58:57,089 --> 00:58:57,099
are still paying attention and if you
 

3069
00:58:57,099 --> 00:58:58,349
are still paying attention and if you
have this loop and you make it tight

3070
00:58:58,349 --> 00:58:58,359
have this loop and you make it tight
 

3071
00:58:58,359 --> 00:59:00,959
have this loop and you make it tight
enough between the system becoming aware

3072
00:59:00,959 --> 00:59:00,969
enough between the system becoming aware
 

3073
00:59:00,969 --> 00:59:03,120
enough between the system becoming aware
of the contents of its attention and the

00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:03,130
of the contents of its attention and the
 

3075
00:59:03,130 --> 00:59:04,499
of the contents of its attention and the
fact that it's paying attention itself

3076
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:04,509
fact that it's paying attention itself
 

3077
00:59:04,509 --> 00:59:06,029
fact that it's paying attention itself
and makes attention the object of its

3078
00:59:06,029 --> 00:59:06,039
and makes attention the object of its
 

3079
00:59:06,039 --> 00:59:07,949
and makes attention the object of its
attention I think this is the loop over

attention I think this is the loop over
 

3081
00:59:07,959 --> 00:59:11,999
attention I think this is the loop over
which if you wake up so there's this so

which if you wake up so there's this so
 

3083
00:59:12,009 --> 00:59:13,349
which if you wake up so there's this so
there's this attentional mechanism

there's this attentional mechanism

somehow maximized the possibility of
translating the concept bat into German

3152
01:00:41,309 --> 01:00:41,319
translating the concept bat into German
 

3153
01:00:41,319 --> 01:00:43,650
translating the concept bat into German
in the same sentence and this is some a

3154
01:00:43,650 --> 01:00:43,660
in the same sentence and this is some a
 

3155
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:45,329
in the same sentence and this is some a
mistake that the Transformer model is

3156
01:00:45,329 --> 01:00:45,339
mistake that the Transformer model is
 

3157
01:00:45,339 --> 01:00:47,339
mistake that the Transformer model is
not doing because it's tracking identity

3158
01:00:47,339 --> 01:00:47,349
not doing because it's tracking identity
 

3159
01:00:47,349 --> 01:00:49,469
not doing because it's tracking identity
and the attentional mechanism in the

3160
01:00:49,469 --> 01:00:49,479
and the attentional mechanism in the
 

3161
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:50,939
and the attentional mechanism in the
Transformer model is basically putting

3162
01:00:50,939 --> 01:00:50,949
Transformer model is basically putting
 

3163
01:00:50,949 --> 01:00:53,219
Transformer model is basically putting
its finger on individual concepts and

3164
01:00:53,219 --> 01:00:53,229
its finger on individual concepts and
 

3165
01:00:53,229 --> 01:00:56,219
its finger on individual concepts and
make sure that these concepts pop up

3166
01:00:56,219 --> 01:00:56,229
make sure that these concepts pop up
 

3167
01:00:56,229 --> 01:00:57,230
make sure that these concepts pop up
later in the text

3168
01:00:57,230 --> 01:00:57,240
later in the text
 

3169
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:59,420
later in the text
yeah and tracks basically the

3170
01:00:59,420 --> 01:00:59,430
yeah and tracks basically the
 

3171
01:00:59,430 --> 01:01:01,430
yeah and tracks basically the
individuals through the text and it's

3172
01:01:01,430 --> 01:01:01,440
individuals through the text and it's
 

3173
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:04,100
individuals through the text and it's
why the system can learn things that

3174
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:04,110
why the system can learn things that
 

3175
01:01:04,110 --> 01:01:05,750
why the system can learn things that
other systems couldn't before it which

3176
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:05,760
other systems couldn't before it which
 

3177
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:07,790
other systems couldn't before it which
makes the for instance possible to write

3178
01:01:07,790 --> 01:01:07,800
makes the for instance possible to write
 

3179
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:09,170
makes the for instance possible to write
a text where it talks about the

3180
01:01:09,170 --> 01:01:09,180
a text where it talks about the
 

3181
01:01:09,180 --> 01:01:10,640
a text where it talks about the
scientist then the scientist is a name

3182
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:10,650
scientist then the scientist is a name
 

3183
01:01:10,650 --> 01:01:13,370
scientist then the scientist is a name
and has a pronoun and it gets a

3184
01:01:13,370 --> 01:01:13,380
and has a pronoun and it gets a
 

3185
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:15,500
and has a pronoun and it gets a
consistent story about that thing what

3186
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:15,510
consistent story about that thing what
 

3187
01:01:15,510 --> 01:01:16,820
consistent story about that thing what
it does not do it doesn't fully

01:01:26,430 --> 01:01:28,910
refer to the same universe and this is
where this thing falls apart but the

3200
01:01:28,910 --> 01:01:28,920
where this thing falls apart but the
 

3201
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:31,460
where this thing falls apart but the
attention in transformer model does not

3202
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:31,470
attention in transformer model does not
 

3203
01:01:31,470 --> 01:01:33,620
attention in transformer model does not
go beyond tracking identity and tracking

3204
01:01:33,620 --> 01:01:33,630
go beyond tracking identity and tracking
 

3205
01:01:33,630 --> 01:01:35,180
go beyond tracking identity and tracking
identity is an important part of

identity is an important part of
 

3207
01:01:35,190 --> 01:01:37,280
identity is an important part of
attention but it's a different very

01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:37,290
attention but it's a different very
 

3209
01:01:37,290 --> 01:01:39,920
attention but it's a different very
specific attentional mechanism and it's

01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:39,930
specific attentional mechanism and it's
 

3211
01:01:39,930 --> 01:01:41,390
specific attentional mechanism and it's
not the one that gives rise to the type

01:01:41,390 --> 01:01:41,400
not the one that gives rise to the type
 

3213
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:42,830
not the one that gives rise to the type

just to linger I know what what do you

3216
01:01:44,330 --> 01:01:44,340
just to linger I know what what do you
 

3217
01:01:44,340 --> 01:01:46,250
just to linger I know what what do you
mean by identity in the context of

3218
01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:46,260
mean by identity in the context of
 

3219
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:49,310
mean by identity in the context of
language so when you talk about language

3220
01:01:49,310 --> 01:01:49,320
language so when you talk about language
 

3221
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:51,050
language so when you talk about language
that you have different words that can

3222
01:01:51,050 --> 01:01:51,060
that you have different words that can
 

3223
01:01:51,060 --> 01:01:53,270
that you have different words that can
refer to the same concept got it and in

3224
01:01:53,270 --> 01:01:53,280
refer to the same concept got it and in
 

3225
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:56,690
refer to the same concept got it and in
the sensor concepts so yes and it can

3226
01:01:56,690 --> 01:01:56,700
the sensor concepts so yes and it can
 

3227
01:01:56,700 --> 01:01:59,960
the sensor concepts so yes and it can
also be in a nominal sense or an

3228
01:01:59,960 --> 01:01:59,970
also be in a nominal sense or an
 

3229
01:01:59,970 --> 01:02:03,260
also be in a nominal sense or an
indexical sense that you say yeah this

3230
01:02:03,260 --> 01:02:03,270
indexical sense that you say yeah this
 

3231
01:02:03,270 --> 01:02:04,970
indexical sense that you say yeah this
word does not only refer to this class

3232
01:02:04,970 --> 01:02:04,980
word does not only refer to this class
 

3233
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:06,890
word does not only refer to this class
of objects but it refers to a definite

3234
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:06,900
of objects but it refers to a definite
 

3235
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:09,290
of objects but it refers to a definite
object to some kind of agent that waves

3236
01:02:09,290 --> 01:02:09,300
object to some kind of agent that waves
 

3237
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:12,260
object to some kind of agent that waves
their way to through the story and it's

3238
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:12,270
their way to through the story and it's
 

3239
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:14,540
their way to through the story and it's
only referred by different ways in the

3240
01:02:14,540 --> 01:02:14,550
only referred by different ways in the
 

3241
01:02:14,550 --> 01:02:16,760
only referred by different ways in the
language so the language is basically a

3242
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:16,770
language so the language is basically a
 

3243
01:02:16,770 --> 01:02:19,130
language so the language is basically a
projection from a conceptual

3244
01:02:19,130 --> 01:02:19,140
projection from a conceptual
 

3245
01:02:19,140 --> 01:02:21,620
projection from a conceptual
representation from a scene that is

3246
01:02:21,620 --> 01:02:21,630
representation from a scene that is
 

3247
01:02:21,630 --> 01:02:23,870
representation from a scene that is
evolving into a discrete string of

01:02:23,870 --> 01:02:23,880
evolving into a discrete string of
 

3249
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:26,600
evolving into a discrete string of
symbols and what the transformer is able

3250
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:26,610
symbols and what the transformer is able
 

3251
01:02:26,610 --> 01:02:29,630
symbols and what the transformer is able
to it learns aspects of this projection

3252
01:02:29,630 --> 01:02:29,640
to it learns aspects of this projection

mechanism that other models couldn't
 

3255
01:02:31,650 --> 01:02:33,770

01:02:47,190 --> 01:02:49,010
where the space of concepts continues to
be integrated so the way you're

01:02:49,010 --> 01:02:49,020
be integrated so the way you're

to design a logical language in which

01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:57,460
enough for doing this and the difficulty
was to deal with perceptual content and

intelligence and consciousness so I
 

3401
01:05:18,750 --> 01:05:21,200
intelligence and consciousness so I
think that language is a particular way

3402
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:21,210
think that language is a particular way
 

3403
01:05:21,210 --> 01:05:23,240
think that language is a particular way
or the natural language that we're using

of abstraction that we used to

in the same sense so they work slightly

different they're more general
expressions of functions and I think the

3420
01:05:39,020 --> 01:05:39,030
expressions of functions and I think the
 

3421
01:05:39,030 --> 01:05:41,390
expressions of functions and I think the
general nature of a model is you have a

3422
01:05:41,390 --> 01:05:41,400
general nature of a model is you have a
 

3423
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:44,420
general nature of a model is you have a
bunch of parameters these are have

bunch of parameters these are have
 

3425
01:05:44,430 --> 01:05:46,010
bunch of parameters these are have
arranged it as these are the variances

arranged it as these are the variances
 

3427
01:05:46,020 --> 01:05:47,599
arranged it as these are the variances
of the world and you have relationships

01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:47,609
of the world and you have relationships
 

3429
01:05:47,609 --> 01:05:49,550
of the world and you have relationships

say if certain parameters have these

say if certain parameters have these
 

3433
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:53,960
say if certain parameters have these
values then other parameters have to

3435
01:05:53,970 --> 01:05:57,470

very early insight in computer science
 

3439
01:05:59,550 --> 01:06:01,579
very early insight in computer science
and I think the some of the earliest

so now he builds a network of small of

so now he builds a network of small of
these primitive Boltzmann machines and

these primitive Boltzmann machines and
 

3485
01:06:48,089 --> 01:06:50,390
these primitive Boltzmann machines and
in some sense you can see a almost

in some sense you can see a almost

deep learning models that we are using
 

3491
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:56,059
deep learning models that we are using
today even though we don't use Boltzmann

3492

today even though we don't use Boltzmann
 

3493
01:06:56,069 --> 01:06:57,920
today even though we don't use Boltzmann
machines at at this point but the idea

3494
01:06:57,920 --> 01:06:57,930
machines at at this point but the idea
 

3495
01:06:57,930 --> 01:06:59,089
machines at at this point but the idea
of the Boltzmann machine is you take

3496
01:06:59,089 --> 01:06:59,099
of the Boltzmann machine is you take
 

3497
01:06:59,099 --> 01:07:00,740
of the Boltzmann machine is you take
this model you clamp some of the values

3498
01:07:00,740 --> 01:07:00,750
this model you clamp some of the values
 

3499
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:03,140
this model you clamp some of the values
to perception and this forces the entire

3500
01:07:03,140 --> 01:07:03,150
to perception and this forces the entire
 

3501
01:07:03,150 --> 01:07:04,640
to perception and this forces the entire
machine to go into a state that is

3502
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:04,650
machine to go into a state that is
 

3503
01:07:04,650 --> 01:07:05,990
machine to go into a state that is
compatible with the states that you

3504
01:07:05,990 --> 01:07:06,000
compatible with the states that you
 

3505
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,700
compatible with the states that you
currently perceive and this state is

3506
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:07,710
currently perceive and this state is
 

3507
01:07:07,710 --> 01:07:11,059
currently perceive and this state is
your model of the world right so I think

3508
01:07:11,059 --> 01:07:11,069
your model of the world right so I think
 

3509
01:07:11,069 --> 01:07:13,040
your model of the world right so I think
it's a very general way of thinking

3510
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:13,050
it's a very general way of thinking
 

3511
01:07:13,050 --> 01:07:16,190
it's a very general way of thinking
about models but we have to use a

3512
01:07:16,190 --> 01:07:16,200
about models but we have to use a
 

3513
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:18,050
about models but we have to use a
different approach to make it work this

3514
01:07:18,050 --> 01:07:18,060
different approach to make it work this
 

3515
01:07:18,060 --> 01:07:20,809
different approach to make it work this
is we have to find different networks

3516
01:07:20,809 --> 01:07:20,819
is we have to find different networks
 

3517
01:07:20,819 --> 01:07:22,460
is we have to find different networks
that train the Boltzmann machine so the

3518
01:07:22,460 --> 01:07:22,470
that train the Boltzmann machine so the
 

3519
01:07:22,470 --> 01:07:23,960
that train the Boltzmann machine so the
mechanism that trains the Boltzmann

3520
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:23,970
mechanism that trains the Boltzmann
 

3521
01:07:23,970 --> 01:07:25,910
mechanism that trains the Boltzmann
machine and the mechanism that makes the

3522
01:07:25,910 --> 01:07:25,920
machine and the mechanism that makes the
 

3523
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:27,620
machine and the mechanism that makes the
Boltzmann machine settle into its state

3524
01:07:27,620 --> 01:07:27,630
Boltzmann machine settle into its state

itself the the kind of mechanism we want

01:07:35,329 --> 01:07:35,339

yes so this the direction in which I

3534
01:07:38,799 --> 01:07:38,809
yes so this the direction in which I
 

3535
01:07:38,809 --> 01:07:41,019
yes so this the direction in which I
think our research is going to go is

3536
01:07:41,019 --> 01:07:41,029
think our research is going to go is
 

3537
01:07:41,029 --> 01:07:43,630
think our research is going to go is
going to for instance what you notice in

3538
01:07:43,630 --> 01:07:43,640
going to for instance what you notice in
 

3539
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:46,180
going to for instance what you notice in
perception is our perceptual models of

3540
01:07:46,180 --> 01:07:46,190
perception is our perceptual models of
 

3541
01:07:46,190 --> 01:07:47,829
perception is our perceptual models of
the world are not probabilistic but

3542
01:07:47,829 --> 01:07:47,839
the world are not probabilistic but
 

3543
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:49,930
the world are not probabilistic but
possible istic which means with them you

3544
01:07:49,930 --> 01:07:49,940
possible istic which means with them you
 

3545
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:51,549
possible istic which means with them you
should be able to perceive things that

3546
01:07:51,549 --> 01:07:51,559
should be able to perceive things that
 

3547
01:07:51,559 --> 01:07:55,359
should be able to perceive things that
are improbable but possible right the

3548
01:07:55,359 --> 01:07:55,369
are improbable but possible right the

3551
01:07:56,990 --> 01:07:58,990
sexual State is valid not if it's

3552
01:07:58,990 --> 01:07:59,000
probable but if it's possible if it's
 

3553
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,269
probable but if it's possible if it's
quite coherent yeah so if you see a

01:09:27,879 --> 01:09:27,889
of AI classical a I work by identifying
 

3627
01:09:27,889 --> 01:09:29,829
of AI classical a I work by identifying
a problem into the possible solution and

3628
01:09:29,829 --> 01:09:29,839
a problem into the possible solution and
 

3629
01:09:29,839 --> 01:09:31,660
a problem into the possible solution and
implementing the solution right program

3630
01:09:31,660 --> 01:09:31,670
implementing the solution right program
 

3631
01:09:31,670 --> 01:09:34,419
implementing the solution right program
that plays chess and right now we are in

3632
01:09:34,419 --> 01:09:34,429
that plays chess and right now we are in
 

3633
01:09:34,429 --> 01:09:36,309
that plays chess and right now we are in
the second wave of AI so instead of

3634
01:09:36,309 --> 01:09:36,319
the second wave of AI so instead of
 

3635
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:38,289
the second wave of AI so instead of
writing the algorithm that implements

3636
01:09:38,289 --> 01:09:38,299
writing the algorithm that implements
 

3637
01:09:38,299 --> 01:09:39,820
writing the algorithm that implements
the solution revise an algorithm that

3638
01:09:39,820 --> 01:09:39,830
the solution revise an algorithm that
 

3639
01:09:39,830 --> 01:09:42,280
the solution revise an algorithm that
automatically searches for an algorithm

3640
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:42,290
automatically searches for an algorithm
 

3641
01:09:42,290 --> 01:09:44,769
automatically searches for an algorithm
that implements the solution so the

3642
01:09:44,769 --> 01:09:44,779
that implements the solution so the
 

3643
01:09:44,779 --> 01:09:46,450
that implements the solution so the
learning system in some sense is an

3644
01:09:46,450 --> 01:09:46,460
learning system in some sense is an
 

3645
01:09:46,460 --> 01:09:48,939
learning system in some sense is an
algorithm that itself discovers the

3646
01:09:48,939 --> 01:09:48,949
algorithm that itself discovers the
 

3647
01:09:48,949 --> 01:09:50,520
algorithm that itself discovers the
algorithm that solves the problem

3648
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:50,530
algorithm that solves the problem
 

3649
01:09:50,530 --> 01:09:52,650
algorithm that solves the problem
or goes too hard to implement it by

3650
01:09:52,650 --> 01:09:52,660
or goes too hard to implement it by
 

3651
01:09:52,660 --> 01:09:54,750
or goes too hard to implement it by
dissolution by hand but we can implement

3652
01:09:54,750 --> 01:09:54,760
dissolution by hand but we can implement
 

3653
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:56,820
dissolution by hand but we can implement
an algorithm that finds the solution yes

3654
01:09:56,820 --> 01:09:56,830
an algorithm that finds the solution yes
 

3655
01:09:56,830 --> 01:09:58,770
an algorithm that finds the solution yes
so now let's move to the third stage

01:09:58,770 --> 01:09:58,780
so now let's move to the third stage
 

3657
01:09:58,780 --> 01:10:00,000
so now let's move to the third stage
right the third stage would be

01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:00,010
right the third stage would be
 

3659
01:10:00,010 --> 01:10:00,720
right the third stage would be

self-organizing into a brain which means

3720
01:11:05,220 --> 01:11:05,230
self-organizing into a brain which means
 

3721
01:11:05,230 --> 01:11:06,630
self-organizing into a brain which means
you stride out with different neuron

3722
01:11:06,630 --> 01:11:06,640
you stride out with different neuron
 

3723

types that have different priors in
which hypothesis to test on how to get

3726
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:11,110
which hypothesis to test on how to get
 

3727
01:11:11,110 --> 01:11:13,140
which hypothesis to test on how to get
its reward and you put them into

3728
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:13,150
its reward and you put them into
 

3729
01:11:13,150 --> 01:11:15,060
its reward and you put them into
different concentrations in a certain

3730
01:11:15,060 --> 01:11:15,070
different concentrations in a certain
 

3731
01:11:15,070 --> 01:11:17,970
different concentrations in a certain
spatial alignment and then you entrain

3732
01:11:17,970 --> 01:11:17,980
spatial alignment and then you entrain
 

3733
01:11:17,980 --> 01:11:20,580
spatial alignment and then you entrain
it in a particular order and as a result

3734
01:11:20,580 --> 01:11:20,590
it in a particular order and as a result
 

3735
01:11:20,590 --> 01:11:22,590
it in a particular order and as a result
you get develop a nice brain yeah so

3736
01:11:22,590 --> 01:11:22,600
you get develop a nice brain yeah so
 

3737
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:24,330
you get develop a nice brain yeah so
okay so the brain is a meta learning

3738
01:11:24,330 --> 01:11:24,340
okay so the brain is a meta learning
 

3739
01:11:24,340 --> 01:11:28,050
okay so the brain is a meta learning
system with a bunch of with

system with a bunch of with
 

3741
01:11:28,060 --> 01:11:32,540
system with a bunch of with
reinforcement learning agents and what I

3742
01:11:32,540 --> 01:11:32,550
reinforcement learning agents and what I
 

3743
01:11:32,550 --> 01:11:36,270
reinforcement learning agents and what I
think you said but just to clarify where

3744
01:11:36,270 --> 01:11:36,280
think you said but just to clarify where
 

3745
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:38,930
think you said but just to clarify where
do the LA there's no centralized

3746
01:11:38,930 --> 01:11:38,940
do the LA there's no centralized
 

3747
01:11:38,940 --> 01:11:41,970
do the LA there's no centralized
government that tells you here's a loss

3748
01:11:41,970 --> 01:11:41,980
government that tells you here's a loss
 

3749
01:11:41,980 --> 01:11:44,100
government that tells you here's a loss
function here's a loss function here's a

3750
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:44,110
function here's a loss function here's a
 

3751
01:11:44,110 --> 01:11:48,060
function here's a loss function here's a
loss function like what who is who says

3752
01:11:48,060 --> 01:11:48,070
loss function like what who is who says
 

3753
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:50,910
loss function like what who is who says
what's the also governments which impose

3754
01:11:50,910 --> 01:11:50,920
what's the also governments which impose
 

3755
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:52,710
what's the also governments which impose
loss functions on different parts of the

3756
01:11:52,710 --> 01:11:52,720
loss functions on different parts of the
 

3757
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:54,450
loss functions on different parts of the
brain so we have differential attention

3758
01:11:54,450 --> 01:11:54,460
brain so we have differential attention
 

3759
01:11:54,460 --> 01:11:56,130
brain so we have differential attention
some areas in your brain get especially

3760
01:11:56,130 --> 01:11:56,140
some areas in your brain get especially
 

3761
01:11:56,140 --> 01:11:58,440
some areas in your brain get especially
rewarded when you look at faces if you

3762
01:11:58,440 --> 01:11:58,450
rewarded when you look at faces if you
 

3763
01:11:58,450 --> 01:11:59,850
rewarded when you look at faces if you
don't have that you will get post of

3764
01:11:59,850 --> 01:11:59,860
don't have that you will get post of
 

3765
01:11:59,860 --> 01:12:01,860
don't have that you will get post of
agnosia which basically mean the

3766
01:12:01,860 --> 01:12:01,870
agnosia which basically mean the
 

3767
01:12:01,870 --> 01:12:03,870
agnosia which basically mean the
inability to tell people apart by their

3768
01:12:03,870 --> 01:12:03,880
inability to tell people apart by their
 

3769
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:04,530
inability to tell people apart by their
faces

3770
01:12:04,530 --> 01:12:04,540
faces
 

3771
01:12:04,540 --> 01:12:07,110
faces
so and the reason that happens is

3772
01:12:07,110 --> 01:12:07,120
so and the reason that happens is
 

3773
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:09,060
so and the reason that happens is
because it was had an evolutionary

3774
01:12:09,060 --> 01:12:09,070
because it was had an evolutionary
 

3775
01:12:09,070 --> 01:12:10,890
because it was had an evolutionary
advantage like evolution comes in a play

3776
01:12:10,890 --> 01:12:10,900
advantage like evolution comes in a play
 

3777
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:12,170
advantage like evolution comes in a play
here about it's basically an

3778
01:12:12,170 --> 01:12:12,180
here about it's basically an
 

3779
01:12:12,180 --> 01:12:14,220
here about it's basically an
extraordinary attention that we have for

3780
01:12:14,220 --> 01:12:14,230
extraordinary attention that we have for
 

3781
01:12:14,230 --> 01:12:15,990
extraordinary attention that we have for
faces I don't think that people were

3782
01:12:15,990 --> 01:12:16,000
faces I don't think that people were
 

3783
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,910
faces I don't think that people were

entropy gradients where you need to add

3850
01:13:40,590 --> 01:13:40,600
entropy gradients where you need to add
 

3851
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:42,450
entropy gradients where you need to add
a little bit of energy in a specific way

3852
01:13:42,450 --> 01:13:42,460
a little bit of energy in a specific way
 

3853
01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:44,070
a little bit of energy in a specific way
to harvest more energy so we are

3854
01:13:44,070 --> 01:13:44,080
to harvest more energy so we are
 

3855
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:46,620
to harvest more energy so we are
competing combustion yes in many regions

3856
01:13:46,620 --> 01:13:46,630
competing combustion yes in many regions
 

3857
01:13:46,630 --> 01:13:48,990
competing combustion yes in many regions
we do and we try very hard because when

3858
01:13:48,990 --> 01:13:49,000
we do and we try very hard because when
 

3859
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,880
we do and we try very hard because when
we under ekam petition we lose right

3860
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:50,890
we under ekam petition we lose right
 

3861
01:13:50,890 --> 01:13:54,120
we under ekam petition we lose right
yeah so because the combustion is going

3862
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:54,130
yeah so because the combustion is going
 

3863
01:13:54,130 --> 01:13:55,830
yeah so because the combustion is going
to close the entropy gradients much

3864
01:13:55,830 --> 01:13:55,840
to close the entropy gradients much
 

3865
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:58,070
to close the entropy gradients much
faster than we can run yes you gotta

3866
01:13:58,070 --> 01:13:58,080
faster than we can run yes you gotta
 

3867
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:01,410
faster than we can run yes you gotta
quit so I probably am yeah so basically

3868
01:14:01,410 --> 01:14:01,420
quit so I probably am yeah so basically
 

3869
01:14:01,420 --> 01:14:03,270
quit so I probably am yeah so basically
to this because every cell has a Turing

3870
01:14:03,270 --> 01:14:03,280
to this because every cell has a Turing
 

3871
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:05,190
to this because every cell has a Turing
machine built into it it's like

01:14:05,190 --> 01:14:05,200
machine built into it it's like
 

3873
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:07,640
machine built into it it's like
literally a read/write head of the tape

3874
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:07,650
literally a read/write head of the tape
 

3875
01:14:07,650 --> 01:14:10,740
literally a read/write head of the tape
and so everything that's more

3876
01:14:10,740 --> 01:14:10,750
and so everything that's more
 

3877
01:14:10,750 --> 01:14:12,810
and so everything that's more
complicated than a molecule that just is

3878
01:14:12,810 --> 01:14:12,820
complicated than a molecule that just is

a vortex around attractors
 

3881
01:14:16,170 --> 01:14:18,020
a vortex around attractors
that needs the Turing machine in it for

3882
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:18,030
that needs the Turing machine in it for
 

3883
01:14:18,030 --> 01:14:20,930
that needs the Turing machine in it for
its regulation and then you bind cells

3884
01:14:20,930 --> 01:14:20,940
its regulation and then you bind cells
 

3885
01:14:20,940 --> 01:14:22,280
its regulation and then you bind cells
together and you get next level

3886
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:22,290
together and you get next level
 

3887
01:14:22,290 --> 01:14:24,290
together and you get next level
organization or organism where the cells

and for me very interesting discovery in

3892
01:14:30,590 --> 01:14:30,600
and for me very interesting discovery in
 

3893
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:32,180
and for me very interesting discovery in
the last year was the word spirit

3894
01:14:32,180 --> 01:14:32,190
the last year was the word spirit
 

3895
01:14:32,190 --> 01:14:33,770
the last year was the word spirit
because I realized that what spirit

3896
01:14:33,770 --> 01:14:33,780
because I realized that what spirit
 

3897
01:14:33,780 --> 01:14:35,959
because I realized that what spirit
actually means it's an operating system

3898
01:14:35,959 --> 01:14:35,969
actually means it's an operating system
 

3899
01:14:35,969 --> 01:14:38,330
actually means it's an operating system
for an autonomous robot and when the

3900
01:14:38,330 --> 01:14:38,340
for an autonomous robot and when the
 

3901
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:39,890
for an autonomous robot and when the
word was invented people needed this

3902
01:14:39,890 --> 01:14:39,900
word was invented people needed this
 

3903
01:14:39,900 --> 01:14:42,439
word was invented people needed this
word but they didn't have robots that

3904
01:14:42,439 --> 01:14:42,449
word but they didn't have robots that
 

3905
01:14:42,449 --> 01:14:43,729

and so on and they all had spirits and
 

3913
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:52,580

it makes sense to say that the plant is

it makes sense to say that the plant is
 

3915

01:15:19,980 --> 01:15:22,220
interactions of the each service each
other cell all right so you're you're

3942
01:15:22,220 --> 01:15:22,230
other cell all right so you're you're
 

3943
01:15:22,230 --> 01:15:27,320
other cell all right so you're you're
saying is the organism is a function

3944
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:27,330
saying is the organism is a function
 

3945
01:15:27,330 --> 01:15:29,840
saying is the organism is a function
that tells what's what what now that the

3946
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:29,850
that tells what's what what now that the
 

3947
01:15:29,850 --> 01:15:32,450
that tells what's what what now that the
cell sells what to do and the function

3948
01:15:32,450 --> 01:15:32,460
cell sells what to do and the function
 

3949
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:36,860
cell sells what to do and the function
is an emerging the interaction of the

3950
01:15:36,860 --> 01:15:36,870
is an emerging the interaction of the
 

3951
01:15:36,870 --> 01:15:39,350
is an emerging the interaction of the
cells yes so it's basically a

3952
01:15:39,350 --> 01:15:39,360
cells yes so it's basically a
 

3953
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:41,720
cells yes so it's basically a
description of what the plant is doing

3954
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:41,730
description of what the plant is doing
 

3955
01:15:41,730 --> 01:15:44,959
description of what the plant is doing
in terms of macro States and the micro

3956
01:15:44,959 --> 01:15:44,969
in terms of macro States and the micro
 

3957
01:15:44,969 --> 01:15:46,939
in terms of macro States and the micro
States the physical implementation are

3958
01:15:46,939 --> 01:15:46,949
States the physical implementation are
 

3959
01:15:46,949 --> 01:15:49,030
States the physical implementation are
too many of them to describe them so the

3960
01:15:49,030 --> 01:15:49,040
too many of them to describe them so the
 

3961
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:51,229
too many of them to describe them so the
software that we use to describe what

3962
01:15:51,229 --> 01:15:51,239
software that we use to describe what
 

3963
01:15:51,239 --> 01:15:53,240
software that we use to describe what
the plant is doing the spirit of the

3964
01:15:53,240 --> 01:15:53,250
the plant is doing the spirit of the
 

3965
01:15:53,250 --> 01:15:55,010
the plant is doing the spirit of the
plant is the software the operating

3966
01:15:55,010 --> 01:15:55,020
plant is the software the operating
 

3967
01:15:55,020 --> 01:15:57,950
plant is the software the operating
system of the plant right this is a way

3968
01:15:57,950 --> 01:15:57,960
system of the plant right this is a way
 

3969
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:00,229
system of the plant right this is a way
in which V the observers make sense of

3970
01:16:00,229 --> 01:16:00,239
in which V the observers make sense of
 

3971
01:16:00,239 --> 01:16:02,360
in which V the observers make sense of
the plant yes okay same is true for

3972
01:16:02,360 --> 01:16:02,370
the plant yes okay same is true for
 

3973
01:16:02,370 --> 01:16:04,370
the plant yes okay same is true for
people so people have spirits which is

3974
01:16:04,370 --> 01:16:04,380
people so people have spirits which is
 

3975
01:16:04,380 --> 01:16:05,689
people so people have spirits which is
their operating system in a very

3976
01:16:05,689 --> 01:16:05,699
their operating system in a very
 

3977
01:16:05,699 --> 01:16:07,850
their operating system in a very
rightness aspects of that operating

3978
01:16:07,850 --> 01:16:07,860
rightness aspects of that operating
 

3979
01:16:07,860 --> 01:16:09,650
rightness aspects of that operating
system that relate to how your body

3980
01:16:09,650 --> 01:16:09,660
system that relate to how your body
 

3981
01:16:09,660 --> 01:16:11,689
system that relate to how your body
functions and others how you socially

3982
01:16:11,689 --> 01:16:11,699
functions and others how you socially
 

3983
01:16:11,699 --> 01:16:13,370
functions and others how you socially
interact or you interact with yourself

3984
01:16:13,370 --> 01:16:13,380
interact or you interact with yourself
 

3985
01:16:13,380 --> 01:16:15,979
interact or you interact with yourself
and so on and we make models of that

3986
01:16:15,979 --> 01:16:15,989
and so on and we make models of that
 

3987
01:16:15,989 --> 01:16:19,130
and so on and we make models of that
spirit and we think it's a loaded term

3988
01:16:19,130 --> 01:16:19,140
spirit and we think it's a loaded term
 

3989
01:16:19,140 --> 01:16:21,080
spirit and we think it's a loaded term
because it's from a pre-scientific age

3990
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:21,090
because it's from a pre-scientific age
 

3991
01:16:21,090 --> 01:16:24,110
because it's from a pre-scientific age
but we it took the scientific age a long

3992
01:16:24,110 --> 01:16:24,120
but we it took the scientific age a long
 

3993
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:26,450
but we it took the scientific age a long
time to rediscover a term that is pretty

3994
01:16:26,450 --> 01:16:26,460
time to rediscover a term that is pretty
 

3995
01:16:26,460 --> 01:16:28,160
time to rediscover a term that is pretty
much the same thing and I suspect that

3996
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:28,170
much the same thing and I suspect that
 

3997
01:16:28,170 --> 01:16:29,979
much the same thing and I suspect that
the difference is that we still

3998
01:16:29,979 --> 01:16:29,989
the difference is that we still
 

3999
01:16:29,989 --> 01:16:31,810
the difference is that we still
between the old world and the new world

4000

around that like well why do you say

4006
01:16:38,290 --> 01:16:38,300
around that like well why do you say
 

4007
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:40,209
around that like well why do you say
that spirit just to clarify because I'm

4008
01:16:40,209 --> 01:16:40,219
that spirit just to clarify because I'm
 

4009
01:16:40,219 --> 01:16:43,240
that spirit just to clarify because I'm
a little bit confused so the the word

4010
01:16:43,240 --> 01:16:43,250
a little bit confused so the the word
 

4011
01:16:43,250 --> 01:16:44,920
a little bit confused so the the word
spirit is a powerful thing but why did

4012
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:44,930
spirit is a powerful thing but why did
 

4013
01:16:44,930 --> 01:16:46,360
spirit is a powerful thing but why did

you say in the last year or so they
 

4015
01:16:46,370 --> 01:16:49,060
you say in the last year or so they
discovered this do you mean the same old

4016
01:16:49,060 --> 01:16:49,070
discovered this do you mean the same old
 

4017
01:16:49,070 --> 01:16:51,880
discovered this do you mean the same old

try to find out what people mean by

try to find out what people mean by

absence of culture and a culture is in
 

4029
01:17:02,239 --> 01:17:04,270
absence of culture and a culture is in
some sense you could say the spirit of a

4030
01:17:04,270 --> 01:17:04,280
some sense you could say the spirit of a
 

4031
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:07,660
some sense you could say the spirit of a
society that is long game this thing

4032
01:17:07,660 --> 01:17:07,670
society that is long game this thing
 

4033
01:17:07,670 --> 01:17:10,540
society that is long game this thing
that it's become self-aware at a level

4034
01:17:10,540 --> 01:17:10,550
that it's become self-aware at a level
 

4035
01:17:10,550 --> 01:17:12,550
that it's become self-aware at a level
above the individuals where you say if

4036
01:17:12,550 --> 01:17:12,560
above the individuals where you say if
 

4037
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:14,890
above the individuals where you say if
you don't do the following things then

4038
01:17:14,890 --> 01:17:14,900
you don't do the following things then
 

4039

you don't do the following things then
the grand crying crying when children of

4040
01:17:16,570 --> 01:17:16,580
the grand crying crying when children of
 

4041
01:17:16,580 --> 01:17:17,830
the grand crying crying when children of
our children will not have nothing to

4042
01:17:17,830 --> 01:17:17,840
our children will not have nothing to
 

4043
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:18,670
our children will not have nothing to
eat yeah

4044
01:17:18,670 --> 01:17:18,680
eat yeah
 

4045
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:21,370
eat yeah
so if you take this long scope where you

4046
01:17:21,370 --> 01:17:21,380
so if you take this long scope where you
 

4047
01:17:21,380 --> 01:17:23,140
so if you take this long scope where you
try to maximize the length of the game

4048
01:17:23,140 --> 01:17:23,150
try to maximize the length of the game
 

4049
01:17:23,150 --> 01:17:24,640
try to maximize the length of the game
that you are playing as a species to

4050
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:24,650
that you are playing as a species to
 

4051
01:17:24,650 --> 01:17:26,740
that you are playing as a species to
realize that you're part of a larger

4052
01:17:26,740 --> 01:17:26,750
realize that you're part of a larger
 

4053
01:17:26,750 --> 01:17:28,330
realize that you're part of a larger
thing that you cannot fully control you

4054
01:17:28,330 --> 01:17:28,340
thing that you cannot fully control you
 

4055
01:17:28,340 --> 01:17:30,670
thing that you cannot fully control you
probably see to submit to the ecosphere

4056
01:17:30,670 --> 01:17:30,680
probably see to submit to the ecosphere
 

4057
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:33,130
probably see to submit to the ecosphere
instead of trying to completely control

4058
01:17:33,130 --> 01:17:33,140
instead of trying to completely control
 

4059
01:17:33,140 --> 01:17:36,040
instead of trying to completely control
it right there needs to be a certain

4060
01:17:36,040 --> 01:17:36,050
it right there needs to be a certain
 

4061
01:17:36,050 --> 01:17:38,290
it right there needs to be a certain
level at which we can exist as a species

4062
01:17:38,290 --> 01:17:38,300
level at which we can exist as a species
 

4063
01:17:38,300 --> 01:17:41,380
level at which we can exist as a species
if you want to endure and our culture is

4064
01:17:41,380 --> 01:17:41,390
if you want to endure and our culture is
 

4065
01:17:41,390 --> 01:17:43,510
if you want to endure and our culture is
not sustaining this anymore we basically

4066
01:17:43,510 --> 01:17:43,520
not sustaining this anymore we basically
 

4067
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:45,010
not sustaining this anymore we basically
made this bet with the Industrial

4068
01:17:45,010 --> 01:17:45,020
made this bet with the Industrial
 

4069
01:17:45,020 --> 01:17:46,209
made this bet with the Industrial
Revolution that we can control

4070
01:17:46,209 --> 01:17:46,219
Revolution that we can control
 

4071
01:17:46,219 --> 01:17:47,920
Revolution that we can control
everything and the modernist societies

4072
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:47,930
everything and the modernist societies
 

4073
01:17:47,930 --> 01:17:50,709
everything and the modernist societies
was basically unfettered growth led to a

4074
01:17:50,709 --> 01:17:50,719
was basically unfettered growth led to a
 

4075
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:53,470
was basically unfettered growth led to a
situation in which we depend on the

4076
01:17:53,470 --> 01:17:53,480
situation in which we depend on the
 

4077
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:56,760
situation in which we depend on the
ability to control the entire planet and

4078
01:17:56,760 --> 01:17:56,770
ability to control the entire planet and
 

4079
01:17:56,770 --> 01:17:59,229
ability to control the entire planet and
since we are not able to do that as it

4080
01:17:59,229 --> 01:17:59,239
since we are not able to do that as it
 

4081
01:17:59,239 --> 01:18:02,470
since we are not able to do that as it
seems this culture will die if we

4082
01:18:02,470 --> 01:18:02,480
seems this culture will die if we
 

4083
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:04,150
seems this culture will die if we
realize that it doesn't have a future

4084
01:18:04,150 --> 01:18:04,160
realize that it doesn't have a future
 

4085
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:06,340
realize that it doesn't have a future
right we called our children generations

4086
01:18:06,340 --> 01:18:06,350
right we called our children generations
 

4087
01:18:06,350 --> 01:18:09,720
right we called our children generations
that it's not very optimistic things

4088
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:09,730
that it's not very optimistic things
 

4089
01:18:09,730 --> 01:18:12,880
that it's not very optimistic things
yeah you can have this kind of intuition

4090
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:12,890
yeah you can have this kind of intuition
 

4091
01:18:12,890 --> 01:18:16,300
yeah you can have this kind of intuition
that our civilization you say culture

4092
01:18:16,300 --> 01:18:16,310
that our civilization you say culture
 

4093
01:18:16,310 --> 01:18:19,870
that our civilization you say culture
but you really mean this the spirit of

4094
01:18:19,870 --> 01:18:19,880
but you really mean this the spirit of
 

4095
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:22,060
but you really mean this the spirit of
the civilization do in the entirety the

so what can you kion tangle that what's

4100
01:18:29,170 --> 01:18:29,180
so what can you kion tangle that what's
 

4101
01:18:29,180 --> 01:18:31,240
so what can you kion tangle that what's
your intuition behind that so you you

4102
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:31,250
your intuition behind that so you you
 

4103
01:18:31,250 --> 01:18:33,610
your intuition behind that so you you
kind of offline mentioned to me that the

tropic abyss so many of the things you
 

4155
01:19:41,580 --> 01:19:44,060

abyss okay let's let's rewind then the

01:19:58,580 --> 01:19:58,590
abyss okay let's let's rewind then the
 

4165
01:19:58,590 --> 01:20:02,090
abyss okay let's let's rewind then the
Industrial Revolution so how does that

4166
01:20:02,090 --> 01:20:02,100
Industrial Revolution so how does that
 

4167
01:20:02,100 --> 01:20:05,810
Industrial Revolution so how does that
get us into the entropic abyss so in

4168
01:20:05,810 --> 01:20:05,820
get us into the entropic abyss so in
 

4169
01:20:05,820 --> 01:20:07,430
get us into the entropic abyss so in
some sense we burned a hundred million

4170
01:20:07,430 --> 01:20:07,440
some sense we burned a hundred million
 

4171
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:09,560
some sense we burned a hundred million
years worth of trees to get everybody

4172
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:09,570
years worth of trees to get everybody
 

4173
01:20:09,570 --> 01:20:12,380
years worth of trees to get everybody
plumbing yes and the society that we had

4174
01:20:12,380 --> 01:20:12,390
plumbing yes and the society that we had
 

4175
01:20:12,390 --> 01:20:14,600
plumbing yes and the society that we had
before that had a very limited number of

4176
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:14,610
before that had a very limited number of
 

4177
01:20:14,610 --> 01:20:17,950
before that had a very limited number of
people so basically since 0 BC we

4178
01:20:17,950 --> 01:20:17,960
people so basically since 0 BC we
 

4179
01:20:17,960 --> 01:20:21,110
people so basically since 0 BC we
hovered between 300 and 400 million

4180
01:20:21,110 --> 01:20:21,120
hovered between 300 and 400 million
 

4181
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:23,630
hovered between 300 and 400 million
people yes and this only changed with

4182
01:20:23,630 --> 01:20:23,640
people yes and this only changed with
 

4183
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:26,030
people yes and this only changed with
the Enlightenment and the subsequent

4184
01:20:26,030 --> 01:20:26,040
the Enlightenment and the subsequent
 

4185
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:28,760
the Enlightenment and the subsequent
Industrial Revolution and in some sense

4186
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:28,770
Industrial Revolution and in some sense
 

4187
01:20:28,770 --> 01:20:31,070
Industrial Revolution and in some sense
the Enlightenment a feat of rationality

4188
01:20:31,070 --> 01:20:31,080
the Enlightenment a feat of rationality
 

4189
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:33,560
the Enlightenment a feat of rationality
and also freed our norms from the

4190
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:33,570
and also freed our norms from the
 

4191
01:20:33,570 --> 01:20:36,050
and also freed our norms from the
pre-existing order gradually it was an

4192
01:20:36,050 --> 01:20:36,060
pre-existing order gradually it was an
 

4193
01:20:36,060 --> 01:20:38,300
pre-existing order gradually it was an
process that basically have been

4194
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:38,310
process that basically have been
 

4195
01:20:38,310 --> 01:20:39,920
process that basically have been
feedback loop so it was not that just

4196
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:39,930
feedback loop so it was not that just
 

4197
01:20:39,930 --> 01:20:42,380
feedback loop so it was not that just
one cost the other it was a dynamic that

4198
01:20:42,380 --> 01:20:42,390
one cost the other it was a dynamic that
 

4199
01:20:42,390 --> 01:20:45,200
one cost the other it was a dynamic that
started and the dynamic worked by

4200
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:45,210
started and the dynamic worked by
 

4201
01:20:45,210 --> 01:20:47,630
started and the dynamic worked by
basically increasing productivity to

4202
01:20:47,630 --> 01:20:47,640
basically increasing productivity to
 

4203
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:50,630
basically increasing productivity to
such a degree that we could fit all our

4204
01:20:50,630 --> 01:20:50,640
such a degree that we could fit all our
 

4205
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:53,920
such a degree that we could fit all our
children and I think the definition of

4206
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:53,930
children and I think the definition of
 

4207
01:20:53,930 --> 01:20:56,810
children and I think the definition of
property is that you have as many

4208
01:20:56,810 --> 01:20:56,820
property is that you have as many
 

4209
01:20:56,820 --> 01:20:57,680
property is that you have as many
children as

4210
01:20:57,680 --> 01:20:57,690
children as
 

4211
01:20:57,690 --> 01:20:59,959
children as
you can feed before they die which is in

4212
01:20:59,959 --> 01:20:59,969
you can feed before they die which is in
 

4213
01:20:59,969 --> 01:21:01,880
you can feed before they die which is in
some sense the state that all animals on

4214
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:01,890
some sense the state that all animals on
 

4215
01:21:01,890 --> 01:21:05,000
some sense the state that all animals on
earth are in the definition of poverty

4216
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:05,010
earth are in the definition of poverty
 

4217
01:21:05,010 --> 01:21:07,430
earth are in the definition of poverty
is having enough so you can have only so

4218
01:21:07,430 --> 01:21:07,440
is having enough so you can have only so
 

4219
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:09,200
is having enough so you can have only so
many children as you can feed and if you

4220
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:09,210
many children as you can feed and if you
 

4221
01:21:09,210 --> 01:21:11,510
many children as you can feed and if you
have more they die yes and in our

4222
01:21:11,510 --> 01:21:11,520
have more they die yes and in our
 

4223
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:13,400
have more they die yes and in our
societies you can basically have as many

4224
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:13,410
societies you can basically have as many
 

4225
01:21:13,410 --> 01:21:15,189
societies you can basically have as many
children as you want they don't die

4226
01:21:15,189 --> 01:21:15,199
children as you want they don't die
 

4227
01:21:15,199 --> 01:21:18,830
children as you want they don't die
right so I the reason why we don't have

4228
01:21:18,830 --> 01:21:18,840
right so I the reason why we don't have
 

4229
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:20,540
right so I the reason why we don't have
as many children as we want us because

4230
01:21:20,540 --> 01:21:20,550
as many children as we want us because
 

4231
01:21:20,550 --> 01:21:22,670
as many children as we want us because
we also have to pay a price in terms of

4232
01:21:22,670 --> 01:21:22,680
we also have to pay a price in terms of
 

4233
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:23,959
we also have to pay a price in terms of
you have to insert ourselves in the

4234
01:21:23,959 --> 01:21:23,969
you have to insert ourselves in the
 

4235
01:21:23,969 --> 01:21:25,490
you have to insert ourselves in the
lowers also tritonus yeah if you have

4236
01:21:25,490 --> 01:21:25,500
lowers also tritonus yeah if you have
 

4237
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:27,860
lowers also tritonus yeah if you have
too many so basically everybody in the

4238
01:21:27,860 --> 01:21:27,870
too many so basically everybody in the
 

4239
01:21:27,870 --> 01:21:30,950
too many so basically everybody in the
under middle and lower upper class has

4240
01:21:30,950 --> 01:21:30,960
under middle and lower upper class has
 

4241
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:32,720
under middle and lower upper class has
only a limited number of children

4242
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:32,730
only a limited number of children
 

4243
01:21:32,730 --> 01:21:35,180
only a limited number of children
because having more of them would mean a

4244
01:21:35,180 --> 01:21:35,190
because having more of them would mean a
 

4245
01:21:35,190 --> 01:21:37,070
because having more of them would mean a
big economic hit to the individual

4246
01:21:37,070 --> 01:21:37,080
big economic hit to the individual
 

4247
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:38,840
big economic hit to the individual
families yes because children especially

4248
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:38,850
families yes because children especially
 

4249
01:21:38,850 --> 01:21:41,930
families yes because children especially
in u.s. super expensive to have and you

4250
01:21:41,930 --> 01:21:41,940
in u.s. super expensive to have and you
 

4251
01:21:41,940 --> 01:21:43,939
in u.s. super expensive to have and you
only are taken out of this if you are

4252
01:21:43,939 --> 01:21:43,949
only are taken out of this if you are
 

4253
01:21:43,949 --> 01:21:46,070
only are taken out of this if you are
basically super rich or if you are super

4254
01:21:46,070 --> 01:21:46,080
basically super rich or if you are super
 

4255
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:47,570
basically super rich or if you are super
poor if you're super poor it doesn't

4256
01:21:47,570 --> 01:21:47,580
poor if you're super poor it doesn't
 

4257
01:21:47,580 --> 01:21:48,830
poor if you're super poor it doesn't
matter how many kids you have because

4258
01:21:48,830 --> 01:21:48,840
matter how many kids you have because
 

4259
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:50,810
matter how many kids you have because
your status is not going to change and

4260
01:21:50,810 --> 01:21:50,820
your status is not going to change and
 

4261
01:21:50,820 --> 01:21:52,700
your status is not going to change and
these children are largely not going to

4262
01:21:52,700 --> 01:21:52,710
these children are largely not going to
 

4263
01:21:52,710 --> 01:21:55,640
these children are largely not going to
die of hunger so how does this leads us

4264
01:21:55,640 --> 01:21:55,650
die of hunger so how does this leads us
 

4265
01:21:55,650 --> 01:21:58,010
die of hunger so how does this leads us
just self-destruction so there's a lot

4266
01:21:58,010 --> 01:21:58,020
just self-destruction so there's a lot
 

4267
01:21:58,020 --> 01:21:59,780
just self-destruction so there's a lot
of unpleasant properties about this

4268
01:21:59,780 --> 01:21:59,790
of unpleasant properties about this
 

4269
01:21:59,790 --> 01:22:02,030
of unpleasant properties about this
process so basically what we try to do

4270
01:22:02,030 --> 01:22:02,040
process so basically what we try to do
 

4271
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:03,920
process so basically what we try to do
is we try to let our children survive

4272
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:03,930
is we try to let our children survive
 

4273
01:22:03,930 --> 01:22:07,790
is we try to let our children survive
even if they have diseases it's like I

4274
01:22:07,790 --> 01:22:07,800
even if they have diseases it's like I
 

4275
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:09,979
even if they have diseases it's like I
would have died and before my

4276
01:22:09,979 --> 01:22:09,989
would have died and before my
 

4277
01:22:09,989 --> 01:22:13,160
would have died and before my
mid-twenties without modern medicine and

4278
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:13,170
mid-twenties without modern medicine and
 

4279
01:22:13,170 --> 01:22:14,720
mid-twenties without modern medicine and
most of my friends would have as well

4280
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:14,730
most of my friends would have as well
 

4281
01:22:14,730 --> 01:22:17,330
most of my friends would have as well
and so many of us wouldn't live without

4282
01:22:17,330 --> 01:22:17,340
and so many of us wouldn't live without
 

4283
01:22:17,340 --> 01:22:20,300
and so many of us wouldn't live without
the advantages of modern medicine and

4284
01:22:20,300 --> 01:22:20,310
the advantages of modern medicine and
 

4285
01:22:20,310 --> 01:22:23,540
the advantages of modern medicine and
modern industrialized society we get our

4286
01:22:23,540 --> 01:22:23,550
modern industrialized society we get our
 

4287
01:22:23,550 --> 01:22:25,640
modern industrialized society we get our
protein in largely by subduing the

4288
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:25,650
protein in largely by subduing the
 

4289
01:22:25,650 --> 01:22:28,880
protein in largely by subduing the
entirety of nature imagine there would

4290
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:28,890
entirety of nature imagine there would
 

4291
01:22:28,890 --> 01:22:30,620
entirety of nature imagine there would
be some very clever microbe that would

4292
01:22:30,620 --> 01:22:30,630
be some very clever microbe that would
 

4293
01:22:30,630 --> 01:22:32,479
be some very clever microbe that would
live in our organisms and would

4294
01:22:32,479 --> 01:22:32,489
live in our organisms and would
 

4295
01:22:32,489 --> 01:22:36,050
live in our organisms and would
completely harvest them and change them

4296
01:22:36,050 --> 01:22:36,060
completely harvest them and change them
 

4297
01:22:36,060 --> 01:22:39,860
completely harvest them and change them
into a thing that is necessary to

4298
01:22:39,860 --> 01:22:39,870
into a thing that is necessary to
 

4299
01:22:39,870 --> 01:22:41,479
into a thing that is necessary to
sustain itself and it would discover

4300
01:22:41,479 --> 01:22:41,489
sustain itself and it would discover
 

4301
01:22:41,489 --> 01:22:43,670
sustain itself and it would discover
that for instance brain cells are kind

4302
01:22:43,670 --> 01:22:43,680
that for instance brain cells are kind
 

4303
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:45,439
that for instance brain cells are kind
of edible but they're not quite nice so

4304
01:22:45,439 --> 01:22:45,449
of edible but they're not quite nice so
 

4305
01:22:45,449 --> 01:22:47,510
of edible but they're not quite nice so
you need to may have more fat in them

4306
01:22:47,510 --> 01:22:47,520
you need to may have more fat in them
 

4307
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:49,189
you need to may have more fat in them
and you turn them into more fat cells

4308
01:22:49,189 --> 01:22:49,199
and you turn them into more fat cells
 

4309
01:22:49,199 --> 01:22:51,200
and you turn them into more fat cells
yes and basically this big organism

4310
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:51,210
yes and basically this big organism
 

4311
01:22:51,210 --> 01:22:53,390
yes and basically this big organism
would become a vegetable that is barely

4312
01:22:53,390 --> 01:22:53,400
would become a vegetable that is barely
 

4313
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:55,100
would become a vegetable that is barely
alive and it's going to be very brittle

4314
01:22:55,100 --> 01:22:55,110
alive and it's going to be very brittle
 

4315
01:22:55,110 --> 01:22:56,330
alive and it's going to be very brittle
and not resilient when the environment

4316
01:22:56,330 --> 01:22:56,340
and not resilient when the environment
 

4317
01:22:56,340 --> 01:22:59,150
and not resilient when the environment
changes yeah but some part of that

4318
01:22:59,150 --> 01:22:59,160
changes yeah but some part of that
 

4319
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:01,160
changes yeah but some part of that
organism the one that's actually doing

4320
01:23:01,160 --> 01:23:01,170
organism the one that's actually doing
 

4321
01:23:01,170 --> 01:23:03,950
organism the one that's actually doing
all the using of the there's still be

4322
01:23:03,950 --> 01:23:03,960
all the using of the there's still be
 

4323
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:07,400
all the using of the there's still be
somebody thriving so as it relates back

4324
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:07,410
somebody thriving so as it relates back
 

4325
01:23:07,410 --> 01:23:09,620
somebody thriving so as it relates back
to this original question I suspect that

4326
01:23:09,620 --> 01:23:09,630
to this original question I suspect that
 

4327
01:23:09,630 --> 01:23:11,149
to this original question I suspect that
we are not

4328
01:23:11,149 --> 01:23:11,159
we are not
 

4329
01:23:11,159 --> 01:23:13,219
we are not
smartest thing on this planet I suspect

4330
01:23:13,219 --> 01:23:13,229
smartest thing on this planet I suspect
 

4331
01:23:13,229 --> 01:23:15,439
smartest thing on this planet I suspect
that basically every complex system has

4332
01:23:15,439 --> 01:23:15,449
that basically every complex system has
 

4333
01:23:15,449 --> 01:23:19,069
that basically every complex system has
to have some complex regulation if if it

4334
01:23:19,069 --> 01:23:19,079
to have some complex regulation if if it
 

4335
01:23:19,079 --> 01:23:21,649
to have some complex regulation if if it
depends on feedback loops and so for

4336
01:23:21,649 --> 01:23:21,659
depends on feedback loops and so for
 

4337
01:23:21,659 --> 01:23:24,409
depends on feedback loops and so for
instance it's likely to that we should

4338
01:23:24,409 --> 01:23:24,419
instance it's likely to that we should
 

4339
01:23:24,419 --> 01:23:25,669
instance it's likely to that we should
describe a certain degree of

4340
01:23:25,669 --> 01:23:25,679
describe a certain degree of
 

4341
01:23:25,679 --> 01:23:28,549
describe a certain degree of
intelligence to plants the problem is

4342
01:23:28,549 --> 01:23:28,559
intelligence to plants the problem is
 

4343
01:23:28,559 --> 01:23:29,870
intelligence to plants the problem is
that plants don't have a nervous system

4344
01:23:29,870 --> 01:23:29,880
that plants don't have a nervous system
 

4345
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:32,209
that plants don't have a nervous system
so they don't have a way to Telegraph

4346
01:23:32,209 --> 01:23:32,219
so they don't have a way to Telegraph
 

4347
01:23:32,219 --> 01:23:34,279
so they don't have a way to Telegraph
messages over large distances almost

4348
01:23:34,279 --> 01:23:34,289
messages over large distances almost
 

4349
01:23:34,289 --> 01:23:37,159
messages over large distances almost
instantly in the plant and instead they

4350
01:23:37,159 --> 01:23:37,169
instantly in the plant and instead they
 

4351
01:23:37,169 --> 01:23:38,899
instantly in the plant and instead they
will rely on chemicals between adjacent

4352
01:23:38,899 --> 01:23:38,909
will rely on chemicals between adjacent
 

4353
01:23:38,909 --> 01:23:41,359
will rely on chemicals between adjacent
cells which means the signal processing

4354
01:23:41,359 --> 01:23:41,369
cells which means the signal processing
 

4355
01:23:41,369 --> 01:23:43,879
cells which means the signal processing
speed depends on their signal processing

4356
01:23:43,879 --> 01:23:43,889
speed depends on their signal processing
 

4357
01:23:43,889 --> 01:23:46,609
speed depends on their signal processing
with a rate of a few millimeters per

4358
01:23:46,609 --> 01:23:46,619
with a rate of a few millimeters per
 

4359
01:23:46,619 --> 01:23:49,640
with a rate of a few millimeters per
second yes and as a result the if the

4360
01:23:49,640 --> 01:23:49,650
second yes and as a result the if the
 

4361
01:23:49,650 --> 01:23:51,080
second yes and as a result the if the
plant is intelligent it's not going to

4362
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:51,090
plant is intelligent it's not going to
 

4363
01:23:51,090 --> 01:23:52,790
plant is intelligent it's not going to
be intelligent it's similar timescales

4364
01:23:52,790 --> 01:23:52,800
be intelligent it's similar timescales
 

4365
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:55,279
be intelligent it's similar timescales
yes the ability process the timescales

4366
01:23:55,279 --> 01:23:55,289
yes the ability process the timescales
 

4367
01:23:55,289 --> 01:23:58,489
yes the ability process the timescales
different so you suspect we might not be

4368
01:23:58,489 --> 01:23:58,499
different so you suspect we might not be
 

4369
01:23:58,499 --> 01:24:01,729
different so you suspect we might not be
the most intelligent but when were the

4370
01:24:01,729 --> 01:24:01,739
the most intelligent but when were the
 

4371
01:24:01,739 --> 01:24:04,520
the most intelligent but when were the
most intelligent and this in our

4372
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:04,530
most intelligent and this in our
 

4373
01:24:04,530 --> 01:24:07,370
most intelligent and this in our
timescale so basically if you would room

4374
01:24:07,370 --> 01:24:07,380
timescale so basically if you would room
 

4375
01:24:07,380 --> 01:24:09,049
timescale so basically if you would room
out very far you might discover that

4376
01:24:09,049 --> 01:24:09,059
out very far you might discover that
 

4377
01:24:09,059 --> 01:24:11,419
out very far you might discover that
they have been intelligent ecosystems on

4378
01:24:11,419 --> 01:24:11,429
they have been intelligent ecosystems on
 

4379
01:24:11,429 --> 01:24:14,120
they have been intelligent ecosystems on
the planet that existed for thousands of

4380
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:14,130
the planet that existed for thousands of
 

4381
01:24:14,130 --> 01:24:16,699
the planet that existed for thousands of
years in a almost undisturbed state and

4382
01:24:16,699 --> 01:24:16,709
years in a almost undisturbed state and
 

4383
01:24:16,709 --> 01:24:18,500
years in a almost undisturbed state and
it could be that these ecosystems

4384
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:18,510
it could be that these ecosystems
 

4385
01:24:18,510 --> 01:24:20,149
it could be that these ecosystems
actively related their environment so

4386
01:24:20,149 --> 01:24:20,159
actively related their environment so
 

4387
01:24:20,159 --> 01:24:22,459
actively related their environment so
basically change the course of the

4388
01:24:22,459 --> 01:24:22,469
basically change the course of the
 

4389
01:24:22,469 --> 01:24:24,439
basically change the course of the
evolution within this ecosystem to make

4390
01:24:24,439 --> 01:24:24,449
evolution within this ecosystem to make
 

4391
01:24:24,449 --> 01:24:25,759
evolution within this ecosystem to make
it more efficient and as brittle as

4392
01:24:25,759 --> 01:24:25,769
it more efficient and as brittle as
 

4393
01:24:25,769 --> 01:24:28,040
it more efficient and as brittle as
possible something like plants is

4394
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:28,050
possible something like plants is
 

4395
01:24:28,050 --> 01:24:30,679
possible something like plants is
actually a set of living organisms an

4396
01:24:30,679 --> 01:24:30,689
actually a set of living organisms an
 

4397
01:24:30,689 --> 01:24:33,140
actually a set of living organisms an
ecosystem of living organisms they're

4398
01:24:33,140 --> 01:24:33,150
ecosystem of living organisms they're
 

4399
01:24:33,150 --> 01:24:34,699
ecosystem of living organisms they're
just operating a different time scale

4400
01:24:34,699 --> 01:24:34,709
just operating a different time scale
 

4401
01:24:34,709 --> 01:24:36,620
just operating a different time scale
and a far superior intelligence than

4402
01:24:36,620 --> 01:24:36,630
and a far superior intelligence than
 

4403
01:24:36,630 --> 01:24:38,779
and a far superior intelligence than
human beings and then human beings will

4404
01:24:38,779 --> 01:24:38,789
human beings and then human beings will
 

4405
01:24:38,789 --> 01:24:40,520
human beings and then human beings will
die out and plus will still be there and

4406
01:24:40,520 --> 01:24:40,530
die out and plus will still be there and
 

4407
01:24:40,530 --> 01:24:42,620
die out and plus will still be there and
they'll be there yeah

4408
01:24:42,620 --> 01:24:42,630
they'll be there yeah
 

4409
01:24:42,630 --> 01:24:44,270
they'll be there yeah
they also there's an evolutionary

4410
01:24:44,270 --> 01:24:44,280
they also there's an evolutionary
 

4411
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:46,159
they also there's an evolutionary
adaptation playing a role at all of

4412
01:24:46,159 --> 01:24:46,169
adaptation playing a role at all of
 

4413
01:24:46,169 --> 01:24:48,259
adaptation playing a role at all of
these levels for instance if mice don't

4414
01:24:48,259 --> 01:24:48,269
these levels for instance if mice don't
 

4415
01:24:48,269 --> 01:24:50,359
these levels for instance if mice don't
get enough food and get stressed the

4416
01:24:50,359 --> 01:24:50,369
get enough food and get stressed the
 

4417
01:24:50,369 --> 01:24:51,919
get enough food and get stressed the
next generation of mice will be more

4418
01:24:51,919 --> 01:24:51,929
next generation of mice will be more
 

4419
01:24:51,929 --> 01:24:54,709
next generation of mice will be more
sparse in most quani and the reason for

4420
01:24:54,709 --> 01:24:54,719
sparse in most quani and the reason for
 

4421
01:24:54,719 --> 01:24:56,870
sparse in most quani and the reason for
this is because they in a natural

4422
01:24:56,870 --> 01:24:56,880
this is because they in a natural
 

4423
01:24:56,880 --> 01:24:58,100
this is because they in a natural
environment the mice have probably

4424
01:24:58,100 --> 01:24:58,110
environment the mice have probably
 

4425
01:24:58,110 --> 01:25:00,379
environment the mice have probably
hidden a drought or something else and

4426
01:25:00,379 --> 01:25:00,389
hidden a drought or something else and
 

4427
01:25:00,389 --> 01:25:02,750
hidden a drought or something else and
if they over grace then all the things

4428
01:25:02,750 --> 01:25:02,760
if they over grace then all the things
 

4429
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:05,089
if they over grace then all the things
that sustain them might go extinct and

4430
01:25:05,089 --> 01:25:05,099
that sustain them might go extinct and
 

4431
01:25:05,099 --> 01:25:07,250
that sustain them might go extinct and
there will be no mice a few generations

4432
01:25:07,250 --> 01:25:07,260
there will be no mice a few generations
 

4433
01:25:07,260 --> 01:25:09,199
there will be no mice a few generations
from now so and to make sure that there

4434
01:25:09,199 --> 01:25:09,209
from now so and to make sure that there
 

4435
01:25:09,209 --> 01:25:10,729
from now so and to make sure that there
will be mice and five generations from

4436
01:25:10,729 --> 01:25:10,739
will be mice and five generations from
 

4437
01:25:10,739 --> 01:25:13,969
will be mice and five generations from
now they see the mice scale back and a

4438
01:25:13,969 --> 01:25:13,979
now they see the mice scale back and a
 

4439
01:25:13,979 --> 01:25:15,589
now they see the mice scale back and a
similar thing happens with the Predators

4440
01:25:15,589 --> 01:25:15,599
similar thing happens with the Predators
 

4441
01:25:15,599 --> 01:25:17,060
similar thing happens with the Predators
of mice they should make sure that the

4442
01:25:17,060 --> 01:25:17,070
of mice they should make sure that the
 

4443
01:25:17,070 --> 01:25:19,399
of mice they should make sure that the
mice don't completely go extinct so in

4444
01:25:19,399 --> 01:25:19,409
mice don't completely go extinct so in
 

4445
01:25:19,409 --> 01:25:21,560
mice don't completely go extinct so in
some sense if the Predators are smart

4446
01:25:21,560 --> 01:25:21,570
some sense if the Predators are smart
 

4447
01:25:21,570 --> 01:25:23,910
some sense if the Predators are smart
enough they will be tasked this shepherd

4448
01:25:23,910 --> 01:25:23,920
enough they will be tasked this shepherd
 

4449
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:27,720
enough they will be tasked this shepherd
their food supply may be the reason why

4450
01:25:27,720 --> 01:25:27,730
their food supply may be the reason why
 

4451
01:25:27,730 --> 01:25:29,340
their food supply may be the reason why
Alliance have much larger brains and

4452
01:25:29,340 --> 01:25:29,350
Alliance have much larger brains and
 

4453
01:25:29,350 --> 01:25:30,959
Alliance have much larger brains and
antelopes is not so much because it's so

4454
01:25:30,959 --> 01:25:30,969
antelopes is not so much because it's so
 

4455
01:25:30,969 --> 01:25:34,110
antelopes is not so much because it's so
hard to catch antelope as opposed to run

4456
01:25:34,110 --> 01:25:34,120
hard to catch antelope as opposed to run
 

4457
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:36,660
hard to catch antelope as opposed to run
away from the lion but the Lions need to

4458
01:25:36,660 --> 01:25:36,670
away from the lion but the Lions need to
 

4459
01:25:36,670 --> 01:25:38,430
away from the lion but the Lions need to
make complex models of their environment

4460
01:25:38,430 --> 01:25:38,440
make complex models of their environment
 

4461
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:40,950
make complex models of their environment
more complex than the antelopes so the

4462
01:25:40,950 --> 01:25:40,960
more complex than the antelopes so the
 

4463
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:43,110
more complex than the antelopes so the
first of all just describing that

4464
01:25:43,110 --> 01:25:43,120
first of all just describing that
 

4465
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:44,820
first of all just describing that
there's a bunch of complex systems and

4466
01:25:44,820 --> 01:25:44,830
there's a bunch of complex systems and
 

4467
01:25:44,830 --> 01:25:46,380
there's a bunch of complex systems and
human beings may not even be the most

4468
01:25:46,380 --> 01:25:46,390
human beings may not even be the most
 

4469
01:25:46,390 --> 01:25:48,270
human beings may not even be the most
special or intelligent to those complex

4470
01:25:48,270 --> 01:25:48,280
special or intelligent to those complex
 

4471
01:25:48,280 --> 01:25:50,910
special or intelligent to those complex
systems even on earth makes me feel a

4472
01:25:50,910 --> 01:25:50,920
systems even on earth makes me feel a
 

4473
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:52,470
systems even on earth makes me feel a
little better about the extinction of

4474
01:25:52,470 --> 01:25:52,480
little better about the extinction of
 

4475
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:54,000
little better about the extinction of
human species that we're talking about

01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:54,010
human species that we're talking about
 

4477
01:25:54,010 --> 01:25:55,950
human species that we're talking about
yes maybe you addressed Gaia's ploy to

4478
01:25:55,950 --> 01:25:55,960
yes maybe you addressed Gaia's ploy to
 

4479
01:25:55,960 --> 01:25:57,060
yes maybe you addressed Gaia's ploy to
put the carbon back into the atmosphere

4480
01:25:57,060 --> 01:25:57,070
put the carbon back into the atmosphere
 

4481
01:25:57,070 --> 01:26:00,720
put the carbon back into the atmosphere
this is just a nice big stain on

4482
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:00,730
this is just a nice big stain on
 

4483
01:26:00,730 --> 01:26:03,870
this is just a nice big stain on
evolution is not as it was trees hers I

4484
01:26:03,870 --> 01:26:03,880
evolution is not as it was trees hers I
 

4485
01:26:03,880 --> 01:26:05,459
evolution is not as it was trees hers I
evolved trees before they could be to

4486
01:26:05,459 --> 01:26:05,469
evolved trees before they could be to
 

4487
01:26:05,469 --> 01:26:06,810
evolved trees before they could be to
adjust it again right there were no

4488
01:26:06,810 --> 01:26:06,820
adjust it again right there were no
 

4489
01:26:06,820 --> 01:26:08,250
adjust it again right there were no
insects that would break all of them

4490
01:26:08,250 --> 01:26:08,260
insects that would break all of them
 

4491
01:26:08,260 --> 01:26:08,990
insects that would break all of them
apart

4492
01:26:08,990 --> 01:26:09,000
apart
 

4493
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,640
apart
cellulose is so robust that you cannot

4494
01:26:11,640 --> 01:26:11,650
cellulose is so robust that you cannot
 

4495
01:26:11,650 --> 01:26:14,280
cellulose is so robust that you cannot
get all of it with microorganisms so

4496
01:26:14,280 --> 01:26:14,290
get all of it with microorganisms so
 

4497
01:26:14,290 --> 01:26:16,050
get all of it with microorganisms so
many of these trees fell into swamps and

4498
01:26:16,050 --> 01:26:16,060
many of these trees fell into swamps and
 

4499
01:26:16,060 --> 01:26:18,300
many of these trees fell into swamps and
all this carbon became inert and could

4500
01:26:18,300 --> 01:26:18,310
all this carbon became inert and could
 

4501
01:26:18,310 --> 01:26:20,370
all this carbon became inert and could
no longer be recycled into organisms and

4502
01:26:20,370 --> 01:26:20,380
no longer be recycled into organisms and
 

4503
01:26:20,380 --> 01:26:22,560
no longer be recycled into organisms and
via the species that is destined to take

4504
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:22,570
via the species that is destined to take
 

4505
01:26:22,570 --> 01:26:26,130
via the species that is destined to take
care of that so this is kind of dig it

4506
01:26:26,130 --> 01:26:26,140
care of that so this is kind of dig it
 

4507
01:26:26,140 --> 01:26:27,540
care of that so this is kind of dig it
out of the ground for the decade the

4508
01:26:27,540 --> 01:26:27,550
out of the ground for the decade the
 

4509
01:26:27,550 --> 01:26:29,040
out of the ground for the decade the
atmosphere in the u.s. is already

4510
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:29,050
atmosphere in the u.s. is already
 

4511
01:26:29,050 --> 01:26:32,010
atmosphere in the u.s. is already
greening yeah so visitin million years

4512
01:26:32,010 --> 01:26:32,020
greening yeah so visitin million years
 

4513
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:33,810
greening yeah so visitin million years
or so when the ecosystems have recovered

4514
01:26:33,810 --> 01:26:33,820
or so when the ecosystems have recovered
 

4515
01:26:33,820 --> 01:26:36,060
or so when the ecosystems have recovered
from the rapid changes yeah that they're

4516
01:26:36,060 --> 01:26:36,070
from the rapid changes yeah that they're
 

4517
01:26:36,070 --> 01:26:37,979
from the rapid changes yeah that they're
not compared to us right now yeah this

4518
01:26:37,979 --> 01:26:37,989
not compared to us right now yeah this
 

4519
01:26:37,989 --> 01:26:39,540
not compared to us right now yeah this
is going to be awesome again and there

4520
01:26:39,540 --> 01:26:39,550
is going to be awesome again and there
 

4521
01:26:39,550 --> 01:26:41,310
is going to be awesome again and there
won't be even a memory of us of us

4522
01:26:41,310 --> 01:26:41,320
won't be even a memory of us of us
 

4523
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:42,689
won't be even a memory of us of us
little apes I think that will be

4524
01:26:42,689 --> 01:26:42,699
little apes I think that will be
 

4525
01:26:42,699 --> 01:26:44,490
little apes I think that will be
memories of us I suspect we are the

4526
01:26:44,490 --> 01:26:44,500
memories of us I suspect we are the
 

4527
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:46,200
memories of us I suspect we are the
first generally intelligent species in

4528
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:46,210
first generally intelligent species in
 

4529
01:26:46,210 --> 01:26:48,209
first generally intelligent species in
the sense we are the first species with

4530
01:26:48,209 --> 01:26:48,219
the sense we are the first species with
 

4531
01:26:48,219 --> 01:26:50,490
the sense we are the first species with
an industrial society because we believe

4532
01:26:50,490 --> 01:26:50,500
an industrial society because we believe
 

4533
01:26:50,500 --> 01:26:51,900
an industrial society because we believe
more phones than bones in the

4534
01:26:51,900 --> 01:26:51,910
more phones than bones in the
 

4535
01:26:51,910 --> 01:26:55,050
more phones than bones in the
stratosphere well see I have phones them

4536
01:26:55,050 --> 01:26:55,060
stratosphere well see I have phones them
 

4537
01:26:55,060 --> 01:26:56,640
stratosphere well see I have phones them
bones I like it

4538
01:26:56,640 --> 01:26:56,650
bones I like it
 

4539
01:26:56,650 --> 01:26:59,250
bones I like it
but then let me push back idea you've

4540
01:26:59,250 --> 01:26:59,260
but then let me push back idea you've
 

4541
01:26:59,260 --> 01:27:01,740
but then let me push back idea you've
kind of suggested that with a very

4542
01:27:01,740 --> 01:27:01,750
kind of suggested that with a very
 

4543
01:27:01,750 --> 01:27:04,500
kind of suggested that with a very
narrow definition of of until I mean why

4544
01:27:04,500 --> 01:27:04,510
narrow definition of of until I mean why
 

4545
01:27:04,510 --> 01:27:08,070
narrow definition of of until I mean why
aren't trees more general a higher-level

4546
01:27:08,070 --> 01:27:08,080
aren't trees more general a higher-level
 

4547
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:10,439
aren't trees more general a higher-level
general intelligence than trees very

4548
01:27:10,439 --> 01:27:10,449
general intelligence than trees very
 

4549
01:27:10,449 --> 01:27:12,419
general intelligence than trees very
intelligent and it would be at different

4550
01:27:12,419 --> 01:27:12,429
intelligent and it would be at different
 

4551
01:27:12,429 --> 01:27:14,250
intelligent and it would be at different
time scales which means within a hundred

4552
01:27:14,250 --> 01:27:14,260
time scales which means within a hundred
 

4553
01:27:14,260 --> 01:27:16,169
time scales which means within a hundred
years the tree is probably not going to

4554
01:27:16,169 --> 01:27:16,179
years the tree is probably not going to
 

4555
01:27:16,179 --> 01:27:17,790
years the tree is probably not going to
make models that are as complex as the

4556
01:27:17,790 --> 01:27:17,800
make models that are as complex as the
 

4557
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:20,010
make models that are as complex as the
one step you make in ten years but maybe

4558
01:27:20,010 --> 01:27:20,020
one step you make in ten years but maybe
 

4559
01:27:20,020 --> 01:27:22,229
one step you make in ten years but maybe
the trees are the ones that made the

4560
01:27:22,229 --> 01:27:22,239
the trees are the ones that made the
 

4561
01:27:22,239 --> 01:27:26,490
the trees are the ones that made the
phones right like like you could say the

4562
01:27:26,490 --> 01:27:26,500
phones right like like you could say the
 

4563
01:27:26,500 --> 01:27:28,919
phones right like like you could say the
entirety of life did it you know the

4564
01:27:28,919 --> 01:27:28,929
entirety of life did it you know the
 

4565
01:27:28,929 --> 01:27:31,140
entirety of life did it you know the
first cell never died the first cell

4566
01:27:31,140 --> 01:27:31,150
first cell never died the first cell
 

4567
01:27:31,150 --> 01:27:33,000
first cell never died the first cell
only split right and every divided and

4568
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:33,010
only split right and every divided and
 

4569
01:27:33,010 --> 01:27:34,970
only split right and every divided and
every cell in our body is still an

4570
01:27:34,970 --> 01:27:34,980
every cell in our body is still an
 

4571
01:27:34,980 --> 01:27:37,080
every cell in our body is still an
instance of the first cell that split

4572
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:37,090
instance of the first cell that split
 

4573
01:27:37,090 --> 01:27:37,800
instance of the first cell that split
off from that

4574
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:37,810
off from that
 

4575
01:27:37,810 --> 01:27:39,510
off from that
a first sell it was only one sell on

4576
01:27:39,510 --> 01:27:39,520
a first sell it was only one sell on
 

4577
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:42,330
a first sell it was only one sell on
this planet as far as we know and so the

4578
01:27:42,330 --> 01:27:42,340
this planet as far as we know and so the
 

4579
01:27:42,340 --> 01:27:43,620
this planet as far as we know and so the
cell is not just a building block of

4580
01:27:43,620 --> 01:27:43,630
cell is not just a building block of
 

4581
01:27:43,630 --> 01:27:44,250
cell is not just a building block of
life

4582
01:27:44,250 --> 01:27:44,260
life
 

4583
01:27:44,260 --> 01:27:46,590
life
it's a hypo organism yeah right and we

4584
01:27:46,590 --> 01:27:46,600
it's a hypo organism yeah right and we
 

4585
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:49,820
it's a hypo organism yeah right and we
are part of this type of organism so

4586
01:27:49,820 --> 01:27:49,830
are part of this type of organism so
 

4587
01:27:49,830 --> 01:27:52,770
are part of this type of organism so
nevertheless this type of organism no

4588
01:27:52,770 --> 01:27:52,780
nevertheless this type of organism no
 

4589
01:27:52,780 --> 01:27:56,220
nevertheless this type of organism no
the this little particular branch of it

4590
01:27:56,220 --> 01:27:56,230
the this little particular branch of it
 

4591
01:27:56,230 --> 01:27:58,620
the this little particular branch of it
which is us humans because the

4592
01:27:58,620 --> 01:27:58,630
which is us humans because the
 

4593
01:27:58,630 --> 01:27:59,970
which is us humans because the
Industrial Revolution and maybe the

4594
01:27:59,970 --> 01:27:59,980
Industrial Revolution and maybe the
 

4595
01:27:59,980 --> 01:28:02,760
Industrial Revolution and maybe the
exponential growth of technology might

4596
01:28:02,760 --> 01:28:02,770
exponential growth of technology might
 

4597
01:28:02,770 --> 01:28:05,520
exponential growth of technology might
somehow destroy ourselves so what what

4598
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:05,530
somehow destroy ourselves so what what
 

4599
01:28:05,530 --> 01:28:07,620
somehow destroy ourselves so what what
do you think is the most likely way we

4600
01:28:07,620 --> 01:28:07,630
do you think is the most likely way we
 

4601
01:28:07,630 --> 01:28:09,690
do you think is the most likely way we
might destroy ourselves so some people

4602
01:28:09,690 --> 01:28:09,700
might destroy ourselves so some people
 

4603
01:28:09,700 --> 01:28:11,970
might destroy ourselves so some people
worry about genetic manipulation some

4604
01:28:11,970 --> 01:28:11,980
worry about genetic manipulation some
 

4605
01:28:11,980 --> 01:28:14,400
worry about genetic manipulation some
people as we've talked about worry about

4606
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:14,410
people as we've talked about worry about
 

4607
01:28:14,410 --> 01:28:17,040
people as we've talked about worry about
either dumb artificial intelligence or

4608
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:17,050
either dumb artificial intelligence or
 

4609
01:28:17,050 --> 01:28:18,450
either dumb artificial intelligence or
super intelligent artificial

4610
01:28:18,450 --> 01:28:18,460
super intelligent artificial
 

4611
01:28:18,460 --> 01:28:21,180
super intelligent artificial
intelligence destroying us some people

4612
01:28:21,180 --> 01:28:21,190
intelligence destroying us some people
 

4613
01:28:21,190 --> 01:28:24,930
intelligence destroying us some people
worry all nuclear weapons and weapons of

4614
01:28:24,930 --> 01:28:24,940
worry all nuclear weapons and weapons of
 

4615
01:28:24,940 --> 01:28:26,520
worry all nuclear weapons and weapons of
war in general what do you think if you

4616
01:28:26,520 --> 01:28:26,530
war in general what do you think if you
 

4617
01:28:26,530 --> 01:28:28,950
war in general what do you think if you
had to if you are a betting man what

4618
01:28:28,950 --> 01:28:28,960
had to if you are a betting man what
 

4619
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:30,180
had to if you are a betting man what
would you bet on in terms of

4620
01:28:30,180 --> 01:28:30,190
would you bet on in terms of
 

4621
01:28:30,190 --> 01:28:32,400
would you bet on in terms of
self-destruction and it would be higher

4622
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:32,410
self-destruction and it would be higher
 

4623
01:28:32,410 --> 01:28:35,580
self-destruction and it would be higher
than 50 or to be higher than 50% so it's

4624
01:28:35,580 --> 01:28:35,590
than 50 or to be higher than 50% so it's
 

4625
01:28:35,590 --> 01:28:37,680
than 50 or to be higher than 50% so it's
very likely that nothing that we bet on

4626
01:28:37,680 --> 01:28:37,690
very likely that nothing that we bet on
 

4627
01:28:37,690 --> 01:28:41,280
very likely that nothing that we bet on
matters after we win our bet so I don't

4628
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:41,290
matters after we win our bet so I don't
 

4629
01:28:41,290 --> 01:28:42,660
matters after we win our bet so I don't
think that bets are literally the right

4630
01:28:42,660 --> 01:28:42,670
think that bets are literally the right
 

4631
01:28:42,670 --> 01:28:44,880
think that bets are literally the right
thing way to go about I mean once you're

4632
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:44,890
thing way to go about I mean once you're
 

4633
01:28:44,890 --> 01:28:46,470
thing way to go about I mean once you're
dead it doesn't you you won't be there

4634
01:28:46,470 --> 01:28:46,480
dead it doesn't you you won't be there
 

4635
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:49,440
dead it doesn't you you won't be there
to collect so it's also not clear if we

4636
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:49,450
to collect so it's also not clear if we
 

4637
01:28:49,450 --> 01:28:52,710
to collect so it's also not clear if we
as a species go extinct but I think that

4638
01:28:52,710 --> 01:28:52,720
as a species go extinct but I think that
 

4639
01:28:52,720 --> 01:28:53,910
as a species go extinct but I think that
our present civilization is not

4640
01:28:53,910 --> 01:28:53,920
our present civilization is not
 

4641
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:55,890
our present civilization is not
sustainable so the thing that will

4642
01:28:55,890 --> 01:28:55,900
sustainable so the thing that will
 

4643
01:28:55,900 --> 01:28:57,450
sustainable so the thing that will
change is there will be probably fewer

4644
01:28:57,450 --> 01:28:57,460
change is there will be probably fewer
 

4645
01:28:57,460 --> 01:29:00,630
change is there will be probably fewer
people on the planet NR today and even

4646
01:29:00,630 --> 01:29:00,640
people on the planet NR today and even
 

4647
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:02,550
people on the planet NR today and even
if not then still most of people that

4648
01:29:02,550 --> 01:29:02,560
if not then still most of people that
 

4649
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:04,650
if not then still most of people that
are alive today will not offering 100

4650
01:29:04,650 --> 01:29:04,660
are alive today will not offering 100
 

4651
01:29:04,660 --> 01:29:06,870
are alive today will not offering 100
years from now because of the geographic

4652
01:29:06,870 --> 01:29:06,880
years from now because of the geographic
 

4653
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:08,430
years from now because of the geographic
changes and so on in the change in the

4654
01:29:08,430 --> 01:29:08,440
changes and so on in the change in the
 

4655
01:29:08,440 --> 01:29:11,460
changes and so on in the change in the
food supply it's quite likely that many

4656
01:29:11,460 --> 01:29:11,470
food supply it's quite likely that many
 

4657
01:29:11,470 --> 01:29:14,010
food supply it's quite likely that many
areas of the planet will only be livable

4658
01:29:14,010 --> 01:29:14,020
areas of the planet will only be livable
 

4659
01:29:14,020 --> 01:29:16,110
areas of the planet will only be livable
is a closed cooling chain in 100 years

4660
01:29:16,110 --> 01:29:16,120
is a closed cooling chain in 100 years
 

4661
01:29:16,120 --> 01:29:18,060
is a closed cooling chain in 100 years
from now so many of the areas around the

4662
01:29:18,060 --> 01:29:18,070
from now so many of the areas around the
 

4663
01:29:18,070 --> 01:29:22,470
from now so many of the areas around the
equator and in subtropical climates that

4664
01:29:22,470 --> 01:29:22,480
equator and in subtropical climates that
 

4665
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:24,720
equator and in subtropical climates that
are now quite pleasant to live in will

4666
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:24,730
are now quite pleasant to live in will
 

4667
01:29:24,730 --> 01:29:26,730
are now quite pleasant to live in will
stop to be inhabitable this is out

4668
01:29:26,730 --> 01:29:26,740
stop to be inhabitable this is out
 

4669
01:29:26,740 --> 01:29:29,730
stop to be inhabitable this is out
everyday you honestly Wow cooling chain

4670
01:29:29,730 --> 01:29:29,740
everyday you honestly Wow cooling chain
 

4671
01:29:29,740 --> 01:29:33,090
everyday you honestly Wow cooling chain
close knit cooling chain communities so

4672
01:29:33,090 --> 01:29:33,100
close knit cooling chain communities so
 

4673
01:29:33,100 --> 01:29:35,370
close knit cooling chain communities so
you think you have a strong worry about

4674
01:29:35,370 --> 01:29:35,380
you think you have a strong worry about
 

4675
01:29:35,380 --> 01:29:38,760
you think you have a strong worry about
the the effects of global warming itself

4676
01:29:38,760 --> 01:29:38,770
the the effects of global warming itself
 

4677
01:29:38,770 --> 01:29:40,440
the the effects of global warming itself
it's not the big issue if you will live

4678
01:29:40,440 --> 01:29:40,450
it's not the big issue if you will live
 

4679
01:29:40,450 --> 01:29:42,330
it's not the big issue if you will live
in Arizona right now you have basically

4680
01:29:42,330 --> 01:29:42,340
in Arizona right now you have basically
 

4681
01:29:42,340 --> 01:29:44,340
in Arizona right now you have basically
three months in the summer in which you

4682
01:29:44,340 --> 01:29:44,350
three months in the summer in which you
 

4683
01:29:44,350 --> 01:29:46,770
three months in the summer in which you
cannot be outside yes and so you have a

4684
01:29:46,770 --> 01:29:46,780
cannot be outside yes and so you have a
 

4685
01:29:46,780 --> 01:29:47,910
cannot be outside yes and so you have a
closed cooling chain you have air

4686
01:29:47,910 --> 01:29:47,920
closed cooling chain you have air
 

4687
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:49,350
closed cooling chain you have air
conditioning in your car in your home

4688
01:29:49,350 --> 01:29:49,360
conditioning in your car in your home
 

4689
01:29:49,360 --> 01:29:50,640
conditioning in your car in your home
and you're fine and if the air

4690
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:50,650
and you're fine and if the air
 

4691
01:29:50,650 --> 01:29:51,770
and you're fine and if the air
conditioning would stop

4692
01:29:51,770 --> 01:29:51,780
conditioning would stop
 

4693
01:29:51,780 --> 01:29:54,860
conditioning would stop
for a few days then in many areas you

4694
01:29:54,860 --> 01:29:54,870
for a few days then in many areas you
 

4695
01:29:54,870 --> 01:29:57,110
for a few days then in many areas you
would not be able to survive frankly we

4696
01:29:57,110 --> 01:29:57,120
would not be able to survive frankly we
 

4697
01:29:57,120 --> 01:29:58,340
would not be able to survive frankly we
just pause for a second

4698
01:29:58,340 --> 01:29:58,350
just pause for a second
 

4699
01:29:58,350 --> 01:30:01,550
just pause for a second
like you say so many brilliant poet ik

4700
01:30:01,550 --> 01:30:01,560
like you say so many brilliant poet ik
 

4701
01:30:01,560 --> 01:30:03,170
like you say so many brilliant poet ik
things like what is a closed is that do

4702
01:30:03,170 --> 01:30:03,180
things like what is a closed is that do
 

4703
01:30:03,180 --> 01:30:05,540
things like what is a closed is that do
people use that term closed cooling

4704
01:30:05,540 --> 01:30:05,550
people use that term closed cooling
 

4705
01:30:05,550 --> 01:30:07,400
people use that term closed cooling
chain I imagine that people use it when

4706
01:30:07,400 --> 01:30:07,410
chain I imagine that people use it when
 

4707
01:30:07,410 --> 01:30:10,100
chain I imagine that people use it when
they describe how they get meat into a

4708
01:30:10,100 --> 01:30:10,110
they describe how they get meat into a
 

4709
01:30:10,110 --> 01:30:11,720
they describe how they get meat into a
supermarket right it could break the

4710
01:30:11,720 --> 01:30:11,730
supermarket right it could break the
 

4711
01:30:11,730 --> 01:30:13,430
supermarket right it could break the
cooling chain and this thing's rights to

4712
01:30:13,430 --> 01:30:13,440
cooling chain and this thing's rights to
 

4713
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:15,140
cooling chain and this thing's rights to
saw you had trouble and you have to

4714
01:30:15,140 --> 01:30:15,150
saw you had trouble and you have to
 

4715
01:30:15,150 --> 01:30:19,280
saw you had trouble and you have to
solve it away there's such a beautiful

4716
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:19,290
solve it away there's such a beautiful
 

4717
01:30:19,290 --> 01:30:21,230
solve it away there's such a beautiful
way to put it's like calling a city a

4718
01:30:21,230 --> 01:30:21,240
way to put it's like calling a city a
 

4719
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:23,330
way to put it's like calling a city a
closed social chain or something like

4720
01:30:23,330 --> 01:30:23,340
closed social chain or something like
 

4721
01:30:23,340 --> 01:30:25,310
closed social chain or something like
that I mean yeah that's right I mean the

4722
01:30:25,310 --> 01:30:25,320
that I mean yeah that's right I mean the
 

4723
01:30:25,320 --> 01:30:26,660
that I mean yeah that's right I mean the
locality of is really yeah but it

4724
01:30:26,660 --> 01:30:26,670
locality of is really yeah but it
 

4725
01:30:26,670 --> 01:30:27,830
locality of is really yeah but it
basically means you wake up in the

4726
01:30:27,830 --> 01:30:27,840
basically means you wake up in the
 

4727
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:29,420
basically means you wake up in the
climatized room you go to work in the

4728
01:30:29,420 --> 01:30:29,430
climatized room you go to work in the
 

4729
01:30:29,430 --> 01:30:31,190
climatized room you go to work in the
climatized car you work in the car all

4730
01:30:31,190 --> 01:30:31,200
climatized car you work in the car all
 

4731
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:32,840
climatized car you work in the car all
into the shop and acclimatized

4732
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:32,850
into the shop and acclimatized
 

4733
01:30:32,850 --> 01:30:35,570
into the shop and acclimatized
supermarket and in between you have very

4734
01:30:35,570 --> 01:30:35,580
supermarket and in between you have very
 

4735
01:30:35,580 --> 01:30:37,040
supermarket and in between you have very
short distance which you run from your

4736
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:37,050
short distance which you run from your
 

4737
01:30:37,050 --> 01:30:38,990
short distance which you run from your
car to the supermarket but you have to

4738
01:30:38,990 --> 01:30:39,000
car to the supermarket but you have to
 

4739
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,450
car to the supermarket but you have to
make sure that your your temperature

4740
01:30:41,450 --> 01:30:41,460
make sure that your your temperature
 

4741
01:30:41,460 --> 01:30:42,830
make sure that your your temperature
does not approach the temperature of the

4742
01:30:42,830 --> 01:30:42,840
does not approach the temperature of the
 

4743
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:44,420
does not approach the temperature of the
environment yeah so the usual thing is

4744
01:30:44,420 --> 01:30:44,430
environment yeah so the usual thing is
 

4745
01:30:44,430 --> 01:30:46,070
environment yeah so the usual thing is
the bad pub temperature the what the

4746
01:30:46,070 --> 01:30:46,080
the bad pub temperature the what the
 

4747
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:47,600
the bad pub temperature the what the
best pub temperature it's what you get

4748
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:47,610
best pub temperature it's what you get
 

4749
01:30:47,610 --> 01:30:52,280
best pub temperature it's what you get
when you take wet clothes and you put it

4750
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:52,290
when you take wet clothes and you put it
 

4751
01:30:52,290 --> 01:30:54,140
when you take wet clothes and you put it
around your thermometer and then you

4752
01:30:54,140 --> 01:30:54,150
around your thermometer and then you
 

4753
01:30:54,150 --> 01:30:56,360
around your thermometer and then you
move it very quickly through the air so

4754
01:30:56,360 --> 01:30:56,370
move it very quickly through the air so
 

4755
01:30:56,370 --> 01:30:59,270
move it very quickly through the air so
you get the evaporation heat yes and as

4756
01:30:59,270 --> 01:30:59,280
you get the evaporation heat yes and as
 

4757
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:02,810
you get the evaporation heat yes and as
soon as you can no longer cool your body

4758
01:31:02,810 --> 01:31:02,820
soon as you can no longer cool your body
 

4759
01:31:02,820 --> 01:31:05,510
soon as you can no longer cool your body
temperature via app evaporation to a

4760
01:31:05,510 --> 01:31:05,520
temperature via app evaporation to a
 

4761
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:07,820
temperature via app evaporation to a
temperature below something like I think

4762
01:31:07,820 --> 01:31:07,830
temperature below something like I think
 

4763
01:31:07,830 --> 01:31:11,690
temperature below something like I think
35 degrees you die right and which means

4764
01:31:11,690 --> 01:31:11,700
35 degrees you die right and which means
 

4765
01:31:11,700 --> 01:31:14,390
35 degrees you die right and which means
if the outside world is dry you can

4766
01:31:14,390 --> 01:31:14,400
if the outside world is dry you can
 

4767
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:16,730
if the outside world is dry you can
still cool yourself down by sweating but

4768
01:31:16,730 --> 01:31:16,740
still cool yourself down by sweating but
 

4769
01:31:16,740 --> 01:31:18,830
still cool yourself down by sweating but
if it has a certain degree of humidity

4770
01:31:18,830 --> 01:31:18,840
if it has a certain degree of humidity
 

4771
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:20,390
if it has a certain degree of humidity
or if it goes up over a certain

4772
01:31:20,390 --> 01:31:20,400
or if it goes up over a certain
 

4773
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:21,800
or if it goes up over a certain
temperature then sweating will not save

4774
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:21,810
temperature then sweating will not save
 

4775
01:31:21,810 --> 01:31:24,830
temperature then sweating will not save
you and this means you even if you're a

4776
01:31:24,830 --> 01:31:24,840
you and this means you even if you're a
 

4777
01:31:24,840 --> 01:31:26,600
you and this means you even if you're a
healthy fit individual within a few

4778
01:31:26,600 --> 01:31:26,610
healthy fit individual within a few
 

4779
01:31:26,610 --> 01:31:28,670
healthy fit individual within a few
hours even if you try to be in the shade

4780
01:31:28,670 --> 01:31:28,680
hours even if you try to be in the shade
 

4781
01:31:28,680 --> 01:31:30,800
hours even if you try to be in the shade
and so on you'll die unless you have

4782
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:30,810
and so on you'll die unless you have
 

4783
01:31:30,810 --> 01:31:34,580
and so on you'll die unless you have
some climate sizing equipment and this

4784
01:31:34,580 --> 01:31:34,590
some climate sizing equipment and this
 

4785
01:31:34,590 --> 01:31:35,960
some climate sizing equipment and this
itself if you as long as you maintain

4786
01:31:35,960 --> 01:31:35,970
itself if you as long as you maintain
 

4787
01:31:35,970 --> 01:31:38,120
itself if you as long as you maintain
civilization and you have energy supply

4788
01:31:38,120 --> 01:31:38,130
civilization and you have energy supply
 

4789
01:31:38,130 --> 01:31:39,950
civilization and you have energy supply
and you have food trucks coming to your

4790
01:31:39,950 --> 01:31:39,960
and you have food trucks coming to your
 

4791
01:31:39,960 --> 01:31:41,360
and you have food trucks coming to your
home that are climatized everything is

4792
01:31:41,360 --> 01:31:41,370
home that are climatized everything is
 

4793
01:31:41,370 --> 01:31:43,970
home that are climatized everything is
fine but what if you lose a large scale

4794
01:31:43,970 --> 01:31:43,980
fine but what if you lose a large scale
 

4795
01:31:43,980 --> 01:31:46,280
fine but what if you lose a large scale
open every culture at the same time so

4796
01:31:46,280 --> 01:31:46,290
open every culture at the same time so
 

4797
01:31:46,290 --> 01:31:48,170
open every culture at the same time so
basically we'll run into food insecurity

4798
01:31:48,170 --> 01:31:48,180
basically we'll run into food insecurity
 

4799
01:31:48,180 --> 01:31:50,420
basically we'll run into food insecurity
because climate becomes very irregular

4800
01:31:50,420 --> 01:31:50,430
because climate becomes very irregular
 

4801
01:31:50,430 --> 01:31:52,190
because climate becomes very irregular
or weather becomes very irregular and

4802
01:31:52,190 --> 01:31:52,200
or weather becomes very irregular and
 

4803
01:31:52,200 --> 01:31:54,310
or weather becomes very irregular and
you have a lot of extreme weather events

4804
01:31:54,310 --> 01:31:54,320
you have a lot of extreme weather events
 

4805
01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:57,950
you have a lot of extreme weather events
so you need to roll most of your foot

4806
01:31:57,950 --> 01:31:57,960
so you need to roll most of your foot
 

4807
01:31:57,960 --> 01:32:00,290
so you need to roll most of your foot
maybe indoor or you need to import your

4808
01:32:00,290 --> 01:32:00,300
maybe indoor or you need to import your
 

4809
01:32:00,300 --> 01:32:02,660
maybe indoor or you need to import your
food from certain regions and maybe you

4810
01:32:02,660 --> 01:32:02,670
food from certain regions and maybe you
 

4811
01:32:02,670 --> 01:32:03,980
food from certain regions and maybe you
are not able to maintain the

4812
01:32:03,980 --> 01:32:03,990
are not able to maintain the
 

4813
01:32:03,990 --> 01:32:05,410
are not able to maintain the
civilization notes without the

civilization notes without the
 

4815
01:32:05,420 --> 01:32:07,660
civilization notes without the
planet to get the infrastructure to get

planet to get the infrastructure to get
 

4817
01:32:07,670 --> 01:32:09,910
planet to get the infrastructure to get
the foot to your home right but there

4818
01:32:09,910 --> 01:32:09,920
the foot to your home right but there
 

4819
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:11,020
the foot to your home right but there
could be is so there could be

4820
01:32:11,020 --> 01:32:11,030
could be is so there could be
 

4821
01:32:11,030 --> 01:32:12,669
could be is so there could be
significant impacts in a sense that

4822
01:32:12,669 --> 01:32:12,679
significant impacts in a sense that
 

4823
01:32:12,679 --> 01:32:13,750
significant impacts in a sense that
people begin to suffer

4824
01:32:13,750 --> 01:32:13,760
people begin to suffer
 

4825
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:16,060
people begin to suffer
they could be wars over resources and so

4826
01:32:16,060 --> 01:32:16,070
they could be wars over resources and so
 

4827
01:32:16,070 --> 01:32:18,820
they could be wars over resources and so
on but ultimately do you have do you not

4828
01:32:18,820 --> 01:32:18,830
on but ultimately do you have do you not
 

4829
01:32:18,830 --> 01:32:22,479
on but ultimately do you have do you not
have a lot of faith but what do you make

4830
01:32:22,479 --> 01:32:22,489
have a lot of faith but what do you make
 

4831
01:32:22,489 --> 01:32:25,390
have a lot of faith but what do you make
of the capacity of technology

4832
01:32:25,390 --> 01:32:25,400
of the capacity of technology
 

4833
01:32:25,400 --> 01:32:28,330
of the capacity of technology
technological innovation to help us

throughout the universe in deep space to
 

4847
01:32:49,130 --> 01:32:50,439
throughout the universe in deep space to
colonize other planets

colonize other planets
 

4849
01:32:50,449 --> 01:32:52,810
colonize other planets
that's one technological step but of

that's one technological step but of
 

4851
01:32:52,820 --> 01:32:55,330
that's one technological step but of
course what Hamas is trying on Mars is

01:32:55,330 --> 01:32:55,340
course what Hamas is trying on Mars is
 

4853
01:32:55,340 --> 01:32:56,590
course what Hamas is trying on Mars is
not to save us from global warming

4854
01:32:56,590 --> 01:32:56,600
not to save us from global warming
 

4855
01:32:56,600 --> 01:32:58,870
not to save us from global warming
because Mars looks much worse than

5033
01:36:34,970 --> 01:36:36,550
fun for Normans right now often omens
right now in two rings and we don't for

5034
01:36:36,550 --> 01:36:36,560
right now in two rings and we don't for
 

5035
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:38,830
right now in two rings and we don't for
some reason I suspect the reason is that

5036
01:36:38,830 --> 01:36:38,840
some reason I suspect the reason is that
 

5037
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:41,230
some reason I suspect the reason is that
we destroy our attention span also the

5038
01:36:41,230 --> 01:36:41,240
we destroy our attention span also the
 

5039
01:36:41,240 --> 01:36:43,330
we destroy our attention span also the
incentives of course different but in

01:36:43,330 --> 01:36:43,340
incentives of course different but in
 

5041
01:36:43,340 --> 01:36:45,430

Cardassians yeah so the reason why we

5042
01:36:45,430 --> 01:36:45,440
Cardassians yeah so the reason why we
 

5043
01:36:45,440 --> 01:36:46,810
Cardassians yeah so the reason why we
are sitting here and doing this as a

5044
01:36:46,810 --> 01:36:46,820
are sitting here and doing this as a
 

5045
01:36:46,820 --> 01:36:48,550
are sitting here and doing this as a
YouTube video is because you and me

5046
01:36:48,550 --> 01:36:48,560
YouTube video is because you and me
 

5047
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:49,960
YouTube video is because you and me
don't have the attention span to write a

5048
01:36:49,960 --> 01:36:49,970
don't have the attention span to write a
 

5049
01:36:49,970 --> 01:36:51,820
don't have the attention span to write a

01:39:31,180 --> 01:39:31,190
sense own a protocol and this protocol
 

5187
01:39:31,190 --> 01:39:33,070
sense own a protocol and this protocol
is imposed on a community and the

5188
01:39:33,070 --> 01:39:33,080
is imposed on a community and the
 

5189
01:39:33,080 --> 01:39:35,500
is imposed on a community and the
protocol has different components for

for importer of other content and so on
 

5197
01:39:42,110 --> 01:39:44,320
for importer of other content and so on
and now imagine that you take these

5198
01:39:44,320 --> 01:39:44,330
and now imagine that you take these
 

5199
01:39:44,330 --> 01:39:47,490
and now imagine that you take these
components of the protocol apart and you

components of the protocol apart and you
 

5201
01:39:47,500 --> 01:39:50,140
components of the protocol apart and you
do it in some sense like communities

5202
01:39:50,140 --> 01:39:50,150
do it in some sense like communities
 

5203
01:39:50,150 --> 01:39:52,600
do it in some sense like communities
visiting this social network and these

visiting this social network and these
 

5205
01:39:52,610 --> 01:39:54,340
visiting this social network and these
communities are allowed to mix and match

5206
01:39:54,340 --> 01:39:54,350
communities are allowed to mix and match
 

5207
01:39:54,350 --> 01:39:56,830
communities are allowed to mix and match
their protocols and design new ones so

5208
01:39:56,830 --> 01:39:56,840
their protocols and design new ones so
 

5209
01:39:56,840 --> 01:39:59,500
their protocols and design new ones so
for instance the UI and the UX can be

for instance the UI and the UX can be
 

5211
01:39:59,510 --> 01:40:01,660
for instance the UI and the UX can be
defined by the community the walls for

sharing content across communities can
be defined the monetization can be

be defined the monetization can be
 

5217
01:40:05,690 --> 01:40:08,050
be defined the monetization can be
redefined the way you reward individual

part of the protocol so for instance it

5232
01:40:23,020 --> 01:40:23,030
part of the protocol so for instance it
 

5233
01:40:23,030 --> 01:40:25,270
part of the protocol so for instance it
could be in some communities it will be

could be in some communities it will be
 

5235
01:40:25,280 --> 01:40:27,130
could be in some communities it will be

01:40:27,140 --> 01:40:28,750
a single person that comes up with these
things and others it's a group of

01:40:28,750 --> 01:40:28,760
things and others it's a group of
 

5239
01:40:28,760 --> 01:40:31,090

will be the best self organizing

5246
01:40:35,980 --> 01:40:35,990
will be the best self organizing
 

5247
01:40:35,990 --> 01:40:37,450
will be the best self organizing
principle for this but the process can

5248
01:40:37,450 --> 01:40:37,460
principle for this but the process can
 

5249
01:40:37,460 --> 01:40:39,400
principle for this but the process can
be automated I mean it seems like the

5250
01:40:39,400 --> 01:40:39,410
be automated I mean it seems like the
 

5251
01:40:39,410 --> 01:40:42,100
be automated I mean it seems like the
brain can be automated so people can

5252
01:40:42,100 --> 01:40:42,110
brain can be automated so people can
 

5253
01:40:42,110 --> 01:40:44,740
brain can be automated so people can
write a software for this and eventually

5254
01:40:44,740 --> 01:40:44,750
write a software for this and eventually
 

5255
01:40:44,750 --> 01:40:47,800
write a software for this and eventually
the idea is let's not make a assumption

5256
01:40:47,800 --> 01:40:47,810
the idea is let's not make a assumption
 

5257
01:40:47,810 --> 01:40:49,420
the idea is let's not make a assumption
about this thing if you don't know what

5258
01:40:49,420 --> 01:40:49,430
about this thing if you don't know what
 

5259
01:40:49,430 --> 01:40:50,980
about this thing if you don't know what
the right solution is in those areas

5260
01:40:50,980 --> 01:40:50,990
the right solution is in those areas
 

5261
01:40:50,990 --> 01:40:52,960
the right solution is in those areas
that we have no idea whether the right

5262
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:52,970
that we have no idea whether the right
 

5263
01:40:52,970 --> 01:40:54,850
that we have no idea whether the right
solution will be people designing this

5264
01:40:54,850 --> 01:40:54,860
solution will be people designing this
 

5265
01:40:54,860 --> 01:40:57,220
solution will be people designing this
ad hoc or machines doing this whether

5266
01:40:57,220 --> 01:40:57,230
ad hoc or machines doing this whether
 

5267
01:40:57,230 --> 01:40:59,890
ad hoc or machines doing this whether
you want to enforce compliance by social

5268
01:40:59,890 --> 01:40:59,900
you want to enforce compliance by social
 

5269
01:40:59,900 --> 01:41:01,130
you want to enforce compliance by social
norms like weak

Orvis software solutions or this AI that
 

5273
01:41:04,530 --> 01:41:06,500
Orvis software solutions or this AI that
goes through the post of people or is a

5274
01:41:06,500 --> 01:41:06,510
goes through the post of people or is a
 

5275
01:41:06,510 --> 01:41:08,660
goes through the post of people or is a
legal principle and so on this is

5276
01:41:08,660 --> 01:41:08,670
legal principle and so on this is
 

5277
01:41:08,670 --> 01:41:10,360
legal principle and so on this is
something maybe you need to find out and

5278
01:41:10,360 --> 01:41:10,370
something maybe you need to find out and
 

5279
01:41:10,370 --> 01:41:13,160
something maybe you need to find out and
so the idea would be if you let the

5280
01:41:13,160 --> 01:41:13,170
so the idea would be if you let the
 

5281
01:41:13,170 --> 01:41:15,620
so the idea would be if you let the
communities evolve and you just control

5282
01:41:15,620 --> 01:41:15,630
communities evolve and you just control
 

5283
01:41:15,630 --> 01:41:17,740
communities evolve and you just control
it to say in such a way that you are

5284
01:41:17,740 --> 01:41:17,750
it to say in such a way that you are
 

5285
01:41:17,750 --> 01:41:19,520
it to say in such a way that you are
incentivizing the most sentient

5286
01:41:19,520 --> 01:41:19,530
incentivizing the most sentient
 

5287
01:41:19,530 --> 01:41:22,010
incentivizing the most sentient
communities hmm the ones that produce

5288
01:41:22,010 --> 01:41:22,020
communities hmm the ones that produce
 

5289
01:41:22,020 --> 01:41:25,490
communities hmm the ones that produce
the most interesting behaviors and that

5290
01:41:25,490 --> 01:41:25,500
the most interesting behaviors and that
 

5291
01:41:25,500 --> 01:41:27,410
the most interesting behaviors and that
allow you to interact in the most

5292
01:41:27,410 --> 01:41:27,420
allow you to interact in the most
 

5293
01:41:27,420 --> 01:41:29,570
allow you to interact in the most
helpful ways to the individuals right so

5294
01:41:29,570 --> 01:41:29,580
helpful ways to the individuals right so
 

5295
01:41:29,580 --> 01:41:30,950
helpful ways to the individuals right so
you have a network that gives you

5296
01:41:30,950 --> 01:41:30,960
you have a network that gives you
 

5297
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:32,840
you have a network that gives you
information that is relevant to you it

5298
01:41:32,840 --> 01:41:32,850
information that is relevant to you it
 

5299
01:41:32,850 --> 01:41:34,880
information that is relevant to you it
helps you to maintain relationships to

5300
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:34,890
helps you to maintain relationships to
 

5301
01:41:34,890 --> 01:41:36,860
helps you to maintain relationships to
others in healthy ways it allows you to

5302
01:41:36,860 --> 01:41:36,870
others in healthy ways it allows you to
 

5303
01:41:36,870 --> 01:41:38,810
others in healthy ways it allows you to
build teams it allows you to basically

5304
01:41:38,810 --> 01:41:38,820
build teams it allows you to basically
 

5305
01:41:38,820 --> 01:41:40,820
build teams it allows you to basically
bring the best of you into this thing

5306
01:41:40,820 --> 01:41:40,830
bring the best of you into this thing
 

5307
01:41:40,830 --> 01:41:42,890
bring the best of you into this thing
and goes into a coupling into a

5308
01:41:42,890 --> 01:41:42,900
and goes into a coupling into a
 

5309
01:41:42,900 --> 01:41:44,330
and goes into a coupling into a
relationship with others in which you

5310
01:41:44,330 --> 01:41:44,340
relationship with others in which you
 

5311
01:41:44,340 --> 01:41:45,980
relationship with others in which you
produce things that you would be unable

5312
01:41:45,980 --> 01:41:45,990
produce things that you would be unable
 

5313
01:41:45,990 --> 01:41:47,570
produce things that you would be unable
to produce alone yes

5314
01:41:47,570 --> 01:41:47,580
to produce alone yes
 

5315
01:41:47,580 --> 01:41:51,350
to produce alone yes
beautifully put so but the key process

5316
01:41:51,350 --> 01:41:51,360
beautifully put so but the key process
 

5317
01:41:51,360 --> 01:41:53,560
beautifully put so but the key process
of that with incentives and evolution is

5318
01:41:53,560 --> 01:41:53,570
of that with incentives and evolution is
 

5319
01:41:53,570 --> 01:41:58,150
of that with incentives and evolution is
things that don't adapt themselves to

5320
01:41:58,150 --> 01:41:58,160
things that don't adapt themselves to
 

5321
01:41:58,160 --> 01:42:02,060
things that don't adapt themselves to
effectively get the incentives have to

5322
01:42:02,060 --> 01:42:02,070
effectively get the incentives have to
 

5323
01:42:02,070 --> 01:42:05,000
effectively get the incentives have to
die and the thing about social media is

5324
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:05,010
die and the thing about social media is
 

5325
01:42:05,010 --> 01:42:07,100
die and the thing about social media is
communities that are unhealthy or

5326
01:42:07,100 --> 01:42:07,110
communities that are unhealthy or
 

5327
01:42:07,110 --> 01:42:08,630
communities that are unhealthy or
whatever you want and it defines the

5328
01:42:08,630 --> 01:42:08,640
whatever you want and it defines the
 

5329
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:11,420
whatever you want and it defines the
incentives really don't like dying one

5330
01:42:11,420 --> 01:42:11,430
incentives really don't like dying one
 

5331
01:42:11,430 --> 01:42:13,070
incentives really don't like dying one
of the things that people really get

5332
01:42:13,070 --> 01:42:13,080
of the things that people really get
 

5333
01:42:13,080 --> 01:42:15,470
of the things that people really get
aggressive protests aggressively is when

5334
01:42:15,470 --> 01:42:15,480
aggressive protests aggressively is when
 

5335
01:42:15,480 --> 01:42:17,990
aggressive protests aggressively is when
they're censored especially in America I

5336
01:42:17,990 --> 01:42:18,000
they're censored especially in America I
 

5337
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
they're censored especially in America I
don't know I don't know much about the

5338
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:20,010
don't know I don't know much about the
 

5339
01:42:20,010 --> 01:42:21,500
don't know I don't know much about the
rest of the world but the idea of

5340
01:42:21,500 --> 01:42:21,510
rest of the world but the idea of
 

5341
01:42:21,510 --> 01:42:24,050
rest of the world but the idea of
freedom of speech the idea of censorship

5342
01:42:24,050 --> 01:42:24,060
freedom of speech the idea of censorship
 

5343
01:42:24,060 --> 01:42:30,370
freedom of speech the idea of censorship
is really painful in America and so what

5344
01:42:30,370 --> 01:42:30,380
is really painful in America and so what
 

5345
01:42:30,380 --> 01:42:34,310
is really painful in America and so what
yeah well what do you think about that

5346
01:42:34,310 --> 01:42:34,320
yeah well what do you think about that
 

5347
01:42:34,320 --> 01:42:37,240
yeah well what do you think about that
have been growing up in East Germany

5348
01:42:37,240 --> 01:42:37,250
have been growing up in East Germany
 

5349
01:42:37,250 --> 01:42:40,070
have been growing up in East Germany
what do you think censorship is an

5350
01:42:40,070 --> 01:42:40,080
what do you think censorship is an
 

5351
01:42:40,080 --> 01:42:42,290
what do you think censorship is an
important tool in our brain in the

5352
01:42:42,290 --> 01:42:42,300
important tool in our brain in the
 

5353
01:42:42,300 --> 01:42:45,590
important tool in our brain in the
intelligence and in the social networks

5354
01:42:45,590 --> 01:42:45,600
intelligence and in the social networks
 

5355
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:49,490
intelligence and in the social networks
so basically if you're not a good member

5356
01:42:49,490 --> 01:42:49,500
so basically if you're not a good member
 

5357
01:42:49,500 --> 01:42:52,550
so basically if you're not a good member
of the entirety of the system they

5358
01:42:52,550 --> 01:42:52,560
of the entirety of the system they
 

5359
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:54,530
of the entirety of the system they
should be blocked away well locked away

5360
01:42:54,530 --> 01:42:54,540
should be blocked away well locked away
 

5361
01:42:54,540 --> 01:42:57,530
should be blocked away well locked away
blocked important thing is who decides

5362
01:42:57,530 --> 01:42:57,540
blocked important thing is who decides
 

5363
01:42:57,540 --> 01:42:59,690
blocked important thing is who decides
that you are a good member who is it

5364
01:42:59,690 --> 01:42:59,700
that you are a good member who is it
 

5365
01:42:59,700 --> 01:43:01,790
that you are a good member who is it
distributed or and what is the outcome

5366
01:43:01,790 --> 01:43:01,800
distributed or and what is the outcome
 

5367
01:43:01,800 --> 01:43:04,700
distributed or and what is the outcome
of the process that decides it both for

5368
01:43:04,700 --> 01:43:04,710
of the process that decides it both for
 

5369
01:43:04,710 --> 01:43:06,620
of the process that decides it both for
the individual and for society at large

5370
01:43:06,620 --> 01:43:06,630
the individual and for society at large
 

5371
01:43:06,630 --> 01:43:09,080
the individual and for society at large
for instance if you have a high trust

5372
01:43:09,080 --> 01:43:09,090
for instance if you have a high trust
 

5373
01:43:09,090 --> 01:43:10,790
for instance if you have a high trust
society you don't need a lot of

5374
01:43:10,790 --> 01:43:10,800
society you don't need a lot of
 

5375
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:12,830
society you don't need a lot of
surveillance and the surveillance is

5376
01:43:12,830 --> 01:43:12,840
surveillance and the surveillance is
 

5377
01:43:12,840 --> 01:43:13,979
surveillance and the surveillance is
even in

5378
01:43:13,979 --> 01:43:13,989
even in
 

5379
01:43:13,989 --> 01:43:16,940
even in
undermining trust yes because it's

5380
01:43:16,940 --> 01:43:16,950
undermining trust yes because it's
 

5381
01:43:16,950 --> 01:43:20,160
undermining trust yes because it's
basically punishing people that look

5382
01:43:20,160 --> 01:43:20,170
basically punishing people that look
 

5383
01:43:20,170 --> 01:43:22,260
basically punishing people that look
suspicious when surveyed but do the

5384
01:43:22,260 --> 01:43:22,270
suspicious when surveyed but do the
 

5385
01:43:22,270 --> 01:43:23,310
suspicious when surveyed but do the
right thing anyway

5386
01:43:23,310 --> 01:43:23,320
right thing anyway
 

5387
01:43:23,320 --> 01:43:25,979
right thing anyway
and the opposite if you have a low trust

5388
01:43:25,979 --> 01:43:25,989
and the opposite if you have a low trust
 

5389
01:43:25,989 --> 01:43:27,720
and the opposite if you have a low trust
society in there and surveillance can be

5390
01:43:27,720 --> 01:43:27,730
society in there and surveillance can be
 

5391
01:43:27,730 --> 01:43:29,490
society in there and surveillance can be
a better trade-off and the u.s. is

5392
01:43:29,490 --> 01:43:29,500
a better trade-off and the u.s. is
 

5393
01:43:29,500 --> 01:43:31,050
a better trade-off and the u.s. is
currently making a transition from a

5394
01:43:31,050 --> 01:43:31,060
currently making a transition from a
 

5395
01:43:31,060 --> 01:43:32,700
currently making a transition from a
relatively high trust a mixed trust

5396
01:43:32,700 --> 01:43:32,710
relatively high trust a mixed trust
 

5397
01:43:32,710 --> 01:43:34,650
relatively high trust a mixed trust
society to a low trust society so

5398
01:43:34,650 --> 01:43:34,660
society to a low trust society so
 

5399
01:43:34,660 --> 01:43:37,110
society to a low trust society so
surveillance will increase another thing

5400
01:43:37,110 --> 01:43:37,120
surveillance will increase another thing
 

5401
01:43:37,120 --> 01:43:38,880
surveillance will increase another thing
is that beliefs are not just Inuit

5402
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:38,890
is that beliefs are not just Inuit
 

5403
01:43:38,890 --> 01:43:40,020
is that beliefs are not just Inuit
representations there are

5404
01:43:40,020 --> 01:43:40,030
representations there are
 

5405
01:43:40,030 --> 01:43:41,610
representations there are
implementations that run code on your

5406
01:43:41,610 --> 01:43:41,620
implementations that run code on your
 

5407
01:43:41,620 --> 01:43:42,120
implementations that run code on your

and change for a reality and change the

5410
01:43:44,550 --> 01:43:44,560
and change for a reality and change the
 

5411
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:45,959
and change for a reality and change the
way you interact with each other at some

5412
01:43:45,959 --> 01:43:45,969
way you interact with each other at some
 

5413
01:43:45,969 --> 01:43:49,490
way you interact with each other at some
level and some of the beliefs are just

5414
01:43:49,490 --> 01:43:49,500
level and some of the beliefs are just
 

5415
01:43:49,500 --> 01:43:51,959
level and some of the beliefs are just
public opinions that we use to display

5416
01:43:51,959 --> 01:43:51,969
public opinions that we use to display
 

5417
01:43:51,969 --> 01:43:54,390
public opinions that we use to display
our alignment so for instance people

5418
01:43:54,390 --> 01:43:54,400
our alignment so for instance people
 

5419
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:57,330
our alignment so for instance people
might say all characters have are the

5420
01:43:57,330 --> 01:43:57,340
might say all characters have are the
 

5421
01:43:57,340 --> 01:43:59,220
might say all characters have are the
same and equally good but still they

5422
01:43:59,220 --> 01:43:59,230
same and equally good but still they
 

5423
01:43:59,230 --> 01:44:00,900
same and equally good but still they
prefer to live in some cultures over

5424
01:44:00,900 --> 01:44:00,910
prefer to live in some cultures over
 

5425
01:44:00,910 --> 01:44:03,570
prefer to live in some cultures over
others very very strongly so and it

5426
01:44:03,570 --> 01:44:03,580
others very very strongly so and it
 

5427
01:44:03,580 --> 01:44:05,190
others very very strongly so and it
turns out that the cultures are defined

5428
01:44:05,190 --> 01:44:05,200
turns out that the cultures are defined
 

5429
01:44:05,200 --> 01:44:06,780
turns out that the cultures are defined
by certain rules of interaction and

5430
01:44:06,780 --> 01:44:06,790
by certain rules of interaction and
 

5431
01:44:06,790 --> 01:44:08,640
by certain rules of interaction and
these rules of interaction lead to

5432
01:44:08,640 --> 01:44:08,650
these rules of interaction lead to
 

5433
01:44:08,650 --> 01:44:10,050
these rules of interaction lead to
different results when you implement

5434
01:44:10,050 --> 01:44:10,060
different results when you implement
 

5435
01:44:10,060 --> 01:44:12,120
different results when you implement
them right so if you adhere to certain

5436
01:44:12,120 --> 01:44:12,130
them right so if you adhere to certain
 

5437
01:44:12,130 --> 01:44:14,160
them right so if you adhere to certain
rules you get different outcomes in

5438
01:44:14,160 --> 01:44:14,170
rules you get different outcomes in
 

5439
01:44:14,170 --> 01:44:17,220
rules you get different outcomes in
different societies and this all leads

5440
01:44:17,220 --> 01:44:17,230
different societies and this all leads
 

5441
01:44:17,230 --> 01:44:20,100
different societies and this all leads
to very tricky situations when people do

5442
01:44:20,100 --> 01:44:20,110
to very tricky situations when people do
 

5443
01:44:20,110 --> 01:44:21,510
to very tricky situations when people do
not have a commitment to shared purpose

5444
01:44:21,510 --> 01:44:21,520
not have a commitment to shared purpose
 

5445
01:44:21,520 --> 01:44:24,330
not have a commitment to shared purpose
and our societies what we need to

5446
01:44:24,330 --> 01:44:24,340
and our societies what we need to
 

5447
01:44:24,340 --> 01:44:26,250
and our societies what we need to
rediscover what it means to have a

5448
01:44:26,250 --> 01:44:26,260
rediscover what it means to have a
 

5449
01:44:26,260 --> 01:44:28,560
rediscover what it means to have a
shared purpose and how to make this

5450
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:28,570
shared purpose and how to make this
 

5451
01:44:28,570 --> 01:44:31,940
shared purpose and how to make this
compatible with a non totalitarian view

5452
01:44:31,940 --> 01:44:31,950
compatible with a non totalitarian view
 

5453
01:44:31,950 --> 01:44:34,410
compatible with a non totalitarian view
so in some sense the u.s. is caught in a

5454
01:44:34,410 --> 01:44:34,420
so in some sense the u.s. is caught in a
 

5455
01:44:34,420 --> 01:44:38,000
so in some sense the u.s. is caught in a
conundrum between totalitarianism and

5456
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:38,010
conundrum between totalitarianism and
 

5457
01:44:38,010 --> 01:44:42,209
conundrum between totalitarianism and
diversity and doesn't it need to how to

5458
01:44:42,209 --> 01:44:42,219
diversity and doesn't it need to how to
 

5459
01:44:42,219 --> 01:44:43,950
diversity and doesn't it need to how to
resolve this and the solutions that the

5460
01:44:43,950 --> 01:44:43,960
resolve this and the solutions that the
 

5461
01:44:43,960 --> 01:44:45,600
resolve this and the solutions that the
u.s. has found so far a very crude

5462
01:44:45,600 --> 01:44:45,610
u.s. has found so far a very crude
 

5463
01:44:45,610 --> 01:44:47,610
u.s. has found so far a very crude
because it's a very young society that

5464
01:44:47,610 --> 01:44:47,620
because it's a very young society that
 

5465
01:44:47,620 --> 01:44:49,530
because it's a very young society that
is also under a lot of tension it seems

5466
01:44:49,530 --> 01:44:49,540
is also under a lot of tension it seems
 

5467
01:44:49,540 --> 01:44:51,150
is also under a lot of tension it seems
to me that the US will have to reinvent

5468
01:44:51,150 --> 01:44:51,160
to me that the US will have to reinvent
 

5469
01:44:51,160 --> 01:44:55,910
to me that the US will have to reinvent
itself what do you think just uh

5470
01:44:55,910 --> 01:44:55,920
itself what do you think just uh
 

5471
01:44:55,920 --> 01:44:58,229
itself what do you think just uh
philosophizing what kind of mechanisms

5472
01:44:58,229 --> 01:44:58,239
philosophizing what kind of mechanisms
 

5473
01:44:58,239 --> 01:45:01,560
philosophizing what kind of mechanisms
of government do you think we as a

5474
01:45:01,560 --> 01:45:01,570
of government do you think we as a
 

5475
01:45:01,570 --> 01:45:03,780
of government do you think we as a
species should be involved with us or

5476
01:45:03,780 --> 01:45:03,790
species should be involved with us or
 

5477
01:45:03,790 --> 01:45:06,050
species should be involved with us or
broadly what do you think will work well

5478
01:45:06,050 --> 01:45:06,060
broadly what do you think will work well
 

5479
01:45:06,060 --> 01:45:09,930
broadly what do you think will work well
as a system of course we don't know it

5480
01:45:09,930 --> 01:45:09,940
as a system of course we don't know it
 

5481
01:45:09,940 --> 01:45:11,640
as a system of course we don't know it
all seems to work pretty crapoly some

5482
01:45:11,640 --> 01:45:11,650
all seems to work pretty crapoly some
 

5483
01:45:11,650 --> 01:45:13,950
all seems to work pretty crapoly some
things worse than others some people

5484
01:45:13,950 --> 01:45:13,960
things worse than others some people
 

5485
01:45:13,960 --> 01:45:16,410
things worse than others some people
argue that communism is the best others

5486
01:45:16,410 --> 01:45:16,420
argue that communism is the best others
 

5487
01:45:16,420 --> 01:45:18,840
argue that communism is the best others
say yeah look at the Soviet Union some

5488
01:45:18,840 --> 01:45:18,850
say yeah look at the Soviet Union some
 

5489
01:45:18,850 --> 01:45:21,209
say yeah look at the Soviet Union some
people argue that anarchy is the best

5490
01:45:21,209 --> 01:45:21,219
people argue that anarchy is the best
 

5491
01:45:21,219 --> 01:45:23,520
people argue that anarchy is the best
and then completely discarding the

5492
01:45:23,520 --> 01:45:23,530
and then completely discarding the
 

5493
01:45:23,530 --> 01:45:26,400
and then completely discarding the
positive effects of government you know

01:45:26,400 --> 01:45:26,410
positive effects of government you know
 

5495
01:45:26,410 --> 01:45:28,520
positive effects of government you know
there's a lot of argument

5496
01:45:28,520 --> 01:45:28,530
there's a lot of argument
 

5497
01:45:28,530 --> 01:45:30,530
there's a lot of argument
u.s. seems to be doing pretty damn well

01:45:30,530 --> 01:45:30,540
u.s. seems to be doing pretty damn well
 

5499

in in the span of history there says

5563
01:46:46,470 --> 01:46:48,110

01:46:48,120 --> 01:46:49,700
because of me right it's not going to
have an influence but I don't get from A

01:46:49,700 --> 01:46:49,710
have an influence but I don't get from A
 

5567
01:46:49,710 --> 01:46:52,610
have an influence but I don't get from A
to B so the way to implement this would

01:46:52,610 --> 01:46:52,620
to B so the way to implement this would
 

5569
01:46:52,620 --> 01:46:55,640
to B so the way to implement this would
be to have a government that is sharing

be to have a government that is sharing
this idea that you should fly less and

5572
01:46:57,740 --> 01:46:57,750
this idea that you should fly less and
 

5573
01:46:57,750 --> 01:46:59,480
this idea that you should fly less and
is then imposing a regulation that for

5574
01:46:59,480 --> 01:46:59,490
is then imposing a regulation that for
 

5575
01:46:59,490 --> 01:47:01,090
is then imposing a regulation that for
instance makes flying more expensive and

5576
01:47:01,090 --> 01:47:01,100
instance makes flying more expensive and
 

5577
01:47:01,100 --> 01:47:05,330
instance makes flying more expensive and
it gives incentives for inventing other

you think I suspect that in some sense

you think I suspect that in some sense

you think I suspect that in some sense
we are both too smart and not smart

we are both too smart and not smart
 

5601
01:47:32,940 --> 01:47:35,030
we are both too smart and not smart
enough which means we are very good at

5602
01:47:35,030 --> 01:47:35,040
enough which means we are very good at
 

5603
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:37,220
enough which means we are very good at
solving near-term problems and at the

01:47:37,220 --> 01:47:37,230
solving near-term problems and at the
 

5605
01:47:37,230 --> 01:47:39,590
solving near-term problems and at the
same time we are unwilling to submit to

5606
01:47:39,590 --> 01:47:39,600
same time we are unwilling to submit to

the end
to the imperatives of that we would have

5610
01:47:43,560 --> 01:47:43,570
to the imperatives of that we would have
 

5611
01:47:43,570 --> 01:47:45,089
to the imperatives of that we would have
to follow in if you want to stick around

to follow in if you want to stick around
 

5613
01:47:45,099 --> 01:47:48,599
to follow in if you want to stick around
right so that makes it difficult if you

5614
01:47:48,599 --> 01:47:48,609
right so that makes it difficult if you
 

5615
01:47:48,609 --> 01:47:50,149
right so that makes it difficult if you
were unable to solve everything

so you could in principle compute all

so you could in principle compute all

very very young you know 300 years
industrial revolution we're very new to

5660
01:48:34,739 --> 01:48:34,749
industrial revolution we're very new to
 

5661
01:48:34,749 --> 01:48:36,389
industrial revolution we're very new to
this idea so you're attached to your

5662
01:48:36,389 --> 01:48:36,399
this idea so you're attached to your
 

5663
01:48:36,399 --> 01:48:38,189
this idea so you're attached to your
kids being alive and not being murdered

5664
01:48:38,189 --> 01:48:38,199
kids being alive and not being murdered
 

5665
01:48:38,199 --> 01:48:40,589
kids being alive and not being murdered
for the greater good of society but that

5666
01:48:40,589 --> 01:48:40,599
for the greater good of society but that
 

5667
01:48:40,599 --> 01:48:42,599
for the greater good of society but that
might be a very temporary moment of time

5668
01:48:42,599 --> 01:48:42,609
might be a very temporary moment of time
 

5669
01:48:42,609 --> 01:48:45,779
might be a very temporary moment of time
yes that we might move might evolve in

5670
01:48:45,779 --> 01:48:45,789
yes that we might move might evolve in
 

5671
01:48:45,789 --> 01:48:47,549
yes that we might move might evolve in
our thinking so like you said when we're

5672
01:48:47,549 --> 01:48:47,559
our thinking so like you said when we're
 

5673
01:48:47,559 --> 01:48:50,819
our thinking so like you said when we're
both smart and not smart enough you're

5674
01:48:50,819 --> 01:48:50,829
both smart and not smart enough you're
 

5675
01:48:50,829 --> 01:48:52,619
both smart and not smart enough you're
probably not this first human

5676
01:48:52,619 --> 01:48:52,629
probably not this first human
 

5677
01:48:52,629 --> 01:48:54,719
probably not this first human
civilization that has discovered

5678
01:48:54,719 --> 01:48:54,729
civilization that has discovered
 

5679
01:48:54,729 --> 01:48:56,549
civilization that has discovered
technology that allows to efficiently

5680
01:48:56,549 --> 01:48:56,559
technology that allows to efficiently
 

5681
01:48:56,559 --> 01:48:59,159
technology that allows to efficiently
over grace our resources and this

5682
01:48:59,159 --> 01:48:59,169
over grace our resources and this
 

5683
01:48:59,169 --> 01:49:01,619
over grace our resources and this
overgrazing is think at some point we

5684
01:49:01,619 --> 01:49:01,629
overgrazing is think at some point we
 

5685
01:49:01,629 --> 01:49:03,149
overgrazing is think at some point we
think they can compensate this because

5686
01:49:03,149 --> 01:49:03,159
think they can compensate this because
 

5687
01:49:03,159 --> 01:49:05,159
think they can compensate this because
if we have eaten all the grass we will

5688
01:49:05,159 --> 01:49:05,169
if we have eaten all the grass we will
 

5689
01:49:05,169 --> 01:49:08,040
if we have eaten all the grass we will
find a way to grow mushrooms right but

5690
01:49:08,040 --> 01:49:08,050
find a way to grow mushrooms right but
 

5691
01:49:08,050 --> 01:49:10,109
find a way to grow mushrooms right but
it could also be that the ecosystems tip

5692
01:49:10,109 --> 01:49:10,119
it could also be that the ecosystems tip
 

5693
01:49:10,119 --> 01:49:12,389
it could also be that the ecosystems tip
and so what really concerns me is not so

5694
01:49:12,389 --> 01:49:12,399
and so what really concerns me is not so
 

5695
01:49:12,399 --> 01:49:14,040
and so what really concerns me is not so
much the end of the civilization because

5696
01:49:14,040 --> 01:49:14,050
much the end of the civilization because
 

5697
01:49:14,050 --> 01:49:16,889
much the end of the civilization because
we will invent a new one but what

5698
01:49:16,889 --> 01:49:16,899
we will invent a new one but what
 

5699
01:49:16,899 --> 01:49:20,310
we will invent a new one but what
concerns me is the fact that for

5700
01:49:20,310 --> 01:49:20,320
concerns me is the fact that for
 

5701
01:49:20,320 --> 01:49:22,919
concerns me is the fact that for
instance the oceans might tip so for

5702
01:49:22,919 --> 01:49:22,929
instance the oceans might tip so for
 

5703
01:49:22,929 --> 01:49:24,449
instance the oceans might tip so for
instance maybe the plankton dies because

5704
01:49:24,449 --> 01:49:24,459
instance maybe the plankton dies because
 

5705
01:49:24,459 --> 01:49:26,279
instance maybe the plankton dies because
of ocean acidification and cyanobacteria

5706
01:49:26,279 --> 01:49:26,289
of ocean acidification and cyanobacteria
 

5707
01:49:26,289 --> 01:49:29,099
of ocean acidification and cyanobacteria
take over and as a result we can no

5708
01:49:29,099 --> 01:49:29,109
take over and as a result we can no
 

5709
01:49:29,109 --> 01:49:31,379
take over and as a result we can no
longer raise the atmosphere this would

5710
01:49:31,379 --> 01:49:31,389
longer raise the atmosphere this would
 

5711
01:49:31,389 --> 01:49:32,849
longer raise the atmosphere this would
be really concerning so basically a

5712
01:49:32,849 --> 01:49:32,859
be really concerning so basically a
 

5713
01:49:32,859 --> 01:49:35,459
be really concerning so basically a
major reboot of most complex organisms

5714
01:49:35,459 --> 01:49:35,469
major reboot of most complex organisms
 

5715
01:49:35,469 --> 01:49:37,199
major reboot of most complex organisms
on earth and I think this is a

5716
01:49:37,199 --> 01:49:37,209
on earth and I think this is a
 

5717
01:49:37,209 --> 01:49:39,869
on earth and I think this is a
possibility I don't know if what the

5718
01:49:39,869 --> 01:49:39,879
possibility I don't know if what the
 

5719
01:49:39,879 --> 01:49:41,909
possibility I don't know if what the
percentage for this possibility is but

5720
01:49:41,909 --> 01:49:41,919
percentage for this possibility is but
 

5721
01:49:41,919 --> 01:49:43,679
percentage for this possibility is but
it doesn't seem to be our language to me

5722
01:49:43,679 --> 01:49:43,689
it doesn't seem to be our language to me
 

5723
01:49:43,689 --> 01:49:45,299
it doesn't seem to be our language to me
if you look at the scale of the changes

5724
01:49:45,299 --> 01:49:45,309
if you look at the scale of the changes
 

5725
01:49:45,309 --> 01:49:46,529
if you look at the scale of the changes
that we've already triggered on this

5726
01:49:46,529 --> 01:49:46,539
that we've already triggered on this
 

5727
01:49:46,539 --> 01:49:49,229
that we've already triggered on this
planet and so Danny Hillis suggests that

5728
01:49:49,229 --> 01:49:49,239
planet and so Danny Hillis suggests that
 

5729
01:49:49,239 --> 01:49:51,449
planet and so Danny Hillis suggests that
for instance we may be able to put chalk

5730
01:49:51,449 --> 01:49:51,459
for instance we may be able to put chalk
 

5731
01:49:51,459 --> 01:49:54,030
for instance we may be able to put chalk
into the stratosphere to

5732
01:49:54,030 --> 01:49:54,040
into the stratosphere to
 

5733
01:49:54,040 --> 01:49:55,620
into the stratosphere to
solar radiation maybe it works maybe

5734
01:49:55,620 --> 01:49:55,630
solar radiation maybe it works maybe
 

5735
01:49:55,630 --> 01:49:57,240
solar radiation maybe it works maybe
there's a sufficient to counter the

5736
01:49:57,240 --> 01:49:57,250
there's a sufficient to counter the
 

5737
01:49:57,250 --> 01:49:59,730
there's a sufficient to counter the
effects of what we've done maybe it

5738
01:49:59,730 --> 01:49:59,740
effects of what we've done maybe it
 

5739
01:49:59,740 --> 01:50:01,080
effects of what we've done maybe it
won't be maybe we won't be able to

5740
01:50:01,080 --> 01:50:01,090
won't be maybe we won't be able to
 

5741
01:50:01,090 --> 01:50:02,880
won't be maybe we won't be able to
implement it by the time it's prevalent

5742
01:50:02,880 --> 01:50:02,890
implement it by the time it's prevalent
 

5743
01:50:02,890 --> 01:50:05,670
implement it by the time it's prevalent
I have no idea how how the future is

5744
01:50:05,670 --> 01:50:05,680
I have no idea how how the future is
 

5745
01:50:05,680 --> 01:50:07,440
I have no idea how how the future is
going to play out in this regard it's

5746
01:50:07,440 --> 01:50:07,450
going to play out in this regard it's
 

5747
01:50:07,450 --> 01:50:10,050
going to play out in this regard it's
just I think it's quite likely that we

5748
01:50:10,050 --> 01:50:10,060
just I think it's quite likely that we
 

5749
01:50:10,060 --> 01:50:12,210
just I think it's quite likely that we
cannot continue like this all our cousin

5750
01:50:12,210 --> 01:50:12,220
cannot continue like this all our cousin
 

5751
01:50:12,220 --> 01:50:16,020
cannot continue like this all our cousin
species the other home units are gone

5752
01:50:16,020 --> 01:50:16,030

 

5753
01:50:16,030 --> 01:50:18,570

so the right step would be to what to

5754
01:50:18,570 --> 01:50:18,580
so the right step would be to what to
 

5755
01:50:18,580 --> 01:50:22,050
so the right step would be to what to
rewind rewind towards a destro

5756
01:50:22,050 --> 01:50:22,060
rewind rewind towards a destro
 

5757
01:50:22,060 --> 01:50:24,810
rewind rewind towards a destro
Revolution and slow the the so it's to

5758
01:50:24,810 --> 01:50:24,820
Revolution and slow the the so it's to
 

5759
01:50:24,820 --> 01:50:28,560
Revolution and slow the the so it's to
try to contain the technological process

5760
01:50:28,560 --> 01:50:28,570
try to contain the technological process
 

5761
01:50:28,570 --> 01:50:30,630
try to contain the technological process
that leads to the overconsumption of

5762
01:50:30,630 --> 01:50:30,640
that leads to the overconsumption of
 

5763
01:50:30,640 --> 01:50:33,420
that leads to the overconsumption of
resources imagine you had get to choose

5764
01:50:33,420 --> 01:50:33,430
resources imagine you had get to choose
 

5765
01:50:33,430 --> 01:50:35,670
resources imagine you had get to choose
you have one lifetime yes you get born

5766
01:50:35,670 --> 01:50:35,680
you have one lifetime yes you get born
 

5767
01:50:35,680 --> 01:50:37,470
you have one lifetime yes you get born
into a sustainable agricultural

5768
01:50:37,470 --> 01:50:37,480
into a sustainable agricultural
 

5769
01:50:37,480 --> 01:50:40,680
into a sustainable agricultural
civilization 300 maybe 400 million

5770
01:50:40,680 --> 01:50:40,690
civilization 300 maybe 400 million
 

5771
01:50:40,690 --> 01:50:44,340
civilization 300 maybe 400 million
people on the planet tops or before this

5772
01:50:44,340 --> 01:50:44,350
people on the planet tops or before this
 

5773
01:50:44,350 --> 01:50:46,800
people on the planet tops or before this
some kind of nomadic species feels like

5774
01:50:46,800 --> 01:50:46,810
some kind of nomadic species feels like
 

5775
01:50:46,810 --> 01:50:49,710
some kind of nomadic species feels like
a million or two million and so you

5776
01:50:49,710 --> 01:50:49,720
a million or two million and so you
 

5777
01:50:49,720 --> 01:50:51,240
a million or two million and so you
don't meet new people unless you give

5778
01:50:51,240 --> 01:50:51,250
don't meet new people unless you give
 

5779
01:50:51,250 --> 01:50:53,610
don't meet new people unless you give
birth to them you cannot travel to other

5780
01:50:53,610 --> 01:50:53,620
birth to them you cannot travel to other
 

5781
01:50:53,620 --> 01:50:55,290
birth to them you cannot travel to other
places in the world there is no internet

5782
01:50:55,290 --> 01:50:55,300
places in the world there is no internet
 

5783
01:50:55,300 --> 01:50:56,940
places in the world there is no internet
there is no interesting intellectual

5784
01:50:56,940 --> 01:50:56,950
there is no interesting intellectual
 

5785
01:50:56,950 --> 01:50:59,040
there is no interesting intellectual
tradition that reaches considerably deep

5786
01:50:59,040 --> 01:50:59,050
tradition that reaches considerably deep
 

5787
01:50:59,050 --> 01:51:00,450
tradition that reaches considerably deep
so you would not discover your own

5788
01:51:00,450 --> 01:51:00,460
so you would not discover your own
 

5789
01:51:00,460 --> 01:51:02,880
so you would not discover your own
completeness probably and so on so we

5790
01:51:02,880 --> 01:51:02,890
completeness probably and so on so we
 

5791
01:51:02,890 --> 01:51:05,460
completeness probably and so on so we
wouldn't exist and the alternative is

5792
01:51:05,460 --> 01:51:05,470
wouldn't exist and the alternative is
 

5793
01:51:05,470 --> 01:51:08,460
wouldn't exist and the alternative is
you get born into an insane world one

5794
01:51:08,460 --> 01:51:08,470
you get born into an insane world one
 

5795
01:51:08,470 --> 01:51:10,020
you get born into an insane world one
that is doomed to die because it has

you like I think I like this one it's a

5802
01:51:16,320 --> 01:51:16,330
you like I think I like this one it's a
 

5803
01:51:16,330 --> 01:51:17,700
you like I think I like this one it's a
very weird thing then when you find

5804
01:51:17,700 --> 01:51:17,710
very weird thing then when you find
 

5805
01:51:17,710 --> 01:51:19,710
very weird thing then when you find
yourself on a Titanic and you see this

5806
01:51:19,710 --> 01:51:19,720
yourself on a Titanic and you see this
 

5807
01:51:19,720 --> 01:51:21,600
yourself on a Titanic and you see this
iceberg and it looks like we are not

5808
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:21,610
iceberg and it looks like we are not
 

5809
01:51:21,610 --> 01:51:22,290
iceberg and it looks like we are not
going to miss it

5810
01:51:22,290 --> 01:51:22,300
going to miss it
 

5811
01:51:22,300 --> 01:51:24,210
going to miss it
and a lot of people are in denial and

5812
01:51:24,210 --> 01:51:24,220
and a lot of people are in denial and
 

5813
01:51:24,220 --> 01:51:25,980
and a lot of people are in denial and
most of the counter arguments sound like

5814

nature so our idea of being close to

5902
01:53:14,970 --> 01:53:14,980
nature so our idea of being close to
 

5903
01:53:14,980 --> 01:53:18,530
nature so our idea of being close to
nature means being close to agriculture

nature means being close to agriculture
 

5905

nature means being close to agriculture
basically forests that don't have

basically forests that don't have
 

5907
01:53:20,590 --> 01:53:23,399
basically forests that don't have
anything in them that eats us see I mean

01:53:23,399 --> 01:53:23,409
anything in them that eats us see I mean
 

5909
01:53:23,409 --> 01:53:26,100
anything in them that eats us see I mean
I want to disagree with that I I think

5910
01:53:26,100 --> 01:53:26,110
I want to disagree with that I I think
 

5911
01:53:26,110 --> 01:53:29,520
I want to disagree with that I I think
the niceness of being close to nature is

01:54:07,270 --> 01:54:09,060
having open wounds it's very unpleasant
well there's a contradiction in there

well there's a contradiction in there
 

5943

well there's a contradiction in there
yes I in you just as you said would not

yes I in you just as you said would not
 

5945
01:54:13,150 --> 01:54:17,430
yes I in you just as you said would not
choose it but if I was forced into it it

5946
01:54:17,430 --> 01:54:17,440
choose it but if I was forced into it it
 

5947
01:54:17,440 --> 01:54:18,839
choose it but if I was forced into it it
would be a fulfilling existence

5948
01:54:18,839 --> 01:54:18,849

if your brain is fed up in such a way

if your brain is fed up in such a way
 

5953
01:54:23,890 --> 01:54:26,400
if your brain is fed up in such a way
that you get rewards optimally in such

that you get rewards optimally in such
 

5955
01:54:26,410 --> 01:54:28,440
that you get rewards optimally in such
an environment and there's some evidence

5956
01:54:28,440 --> 01:54:28,450
an environment and there's some evidence
 

5957
01:54:28,450 --> 01:54:31,610
an environment and there's some evidence
for this that for a certain degree of

for this that for a certain degree of
 

5959
01:54:31,620 --> 01:54:33,570
for this that for a certain degree of
complexity basically people are more

5960
01:54:33,570 --> 01:54:33,580
complexity basically people are more
 

5961
01:54:33,580 --> 01:54:34,950
complexity basically people are more
happy in such environment because it's

5962
01:54:34,950 --> 01:54:34,960
happy in such environment because it's

01:54:34,960 --> 01:54:37,050
happy in such environment because it's
what we largely have evolved for in

5964
01:54:37,050 --> 01:54:37,060
what we largely have evolved for in
 

5965
01:54:37,060 --> 01:54:39,360
what we largely have evolved for in
between we had a few thousand years in

5966
01:54:39,360 --> 01:54:39,370
between we had a few thousand years in
 

5967
01:54:39,370 --> 01:54:40,950
between we had a few thousand years in
which I think we have evolved for a

5968
01:54:40,950 --> 01:54:40,960
which I think we have evolved for a
 

5969
01:54:40,960 --> 01:54:42,950
which I think we have evolved for a

no no that's our air so oh so you have

no no that's our air so oh so you have
 

6127
01:58:01,909 --> 01:58:05,589
no no that's our air so oh so you have
to clear adaptive value then there's

6128
01:58:05,589 --> 01:58:05,599
to clear adaptive value then there's
 

6129
01:58:05,599 --> 01:58:07,359
to clear adaptive value then there's
clear adaptive value to while

Springs is this fear of mortality being
 

6163
01:58:50,140 --> 01:58:52,530
Springs is this fear of mortality being
cognizant of your mortality and the fear

6164
01:58:52,530 --> 01:58:52,540
cognizant of your mortality and the fear
 

6165
01:58:52,540 --> 01:58:54,570
cognizant of your mortality and the fear
of that mortality and then you construct

6166
01:58:54,570 --> 01:58:54,580
of that mortality and then you construct
 

6167
01:58:54,580 --> 01:58:58,740
of that mortality and then you construct
illusions on top of that I guess I'm you

01:58:58,740 --> 01:58:58,750
illusions on top of that I guess I'm you

I think that the fear of death only
 

6181
01:59:14,770 --> 01:59:17,370
I think that the fear of death only
plays a role as long as you don't see

plays a role as long as you don't see

something else you maintain your
identity so you can serve your meaning

identity so you can serve your meaning
 

6209
01:59:45,280 --> 01:59:46,950
identity so you can serve your meaning
so you can do the things that you're

6210
01:59:46,950 --> 01:59:46,960
so you can do the things that you're
 

6211
01:59:46,960 --> 01:59:48,810
so you can do the things that you're
supposed to do before your bad died and

01:59:48,810 --> 01:59:48,820
supposed to do before your bad died and
 

6213
01:59:48,820 --> 01:59:51,030
supposed to do before your bad died and
I suspect that for most people the fear

6214
01:59:51,030 --> 01:59:51,040
I suspect that for most people the fear
 

6215
01:59:51,040 --> 01:59:52,620
I suspect that for most people the fear
of death is the fear of dying before

6216
01:59:52,620 --> 01:59:52,630
of death is the fear of dying before

of death is the fear of dying before
they're done with the things that they

they're done with the things that they

01:59:54,130 --> 01:59:55,380
they're done with the things that they
feel they have to do even though they

01:59:55,380 --> 01:59:55,390
feel they have to do even though they
 

6221
01:59:55,390 --> 01:59:56,910
feel they have to do even though they
cannot quite put their finger on it what

6222
01:59:56,910 --> 01:59:56,920
cannot quite put their finger on it what
 

6223
01:59:56,920 --> 02:00:01,950
cannot quite put their finger on it what
it is what that is right but in the

6224
02:00:01,950 --> 02:00:01,960
it is what that is right but in the
 

6225
02:00:01,960 --> 02:00:04,650
it is what that is right but in the
software world okay they return to the

6226
02:00:04,650 --> 02:00:04,660
software world okay they return to the
 

6227
02:00:04,660 --> 02:00:09,590
software world okay they return to the
question then what happens after we die

6228
02:00:09,590 --> 02:00:09,600

 

6229
02:00:09,600 --> 02:00:11,790

longer there the point of trying is that

longer there the point of trying is that
 

6233
02:00:14,170 --> 02:00:16,680
longer there the point of trying is that
you're gone or maybe I'm not and this is

you're gone or maybe I'm not and this is
 

6235

02:00:20,800 --> 02:00:25,530
what you know it it seems like there's
so much any idea that this is just the

so much any idea that this is just the

so much any idea that this is just the

6240
02:00:27,300 --> 02:00:27,310
mind is just the simulation is

can't quite get direct access to then
 

6249
02:00:39,760 --> 02:00:42,240
can't quite get direct access to then
like the idea of mortality seems to be a

02:00:42,240 --> 02:00:42,250
like the idea of mortality seems to be a
 

6251
02:00:42,250 --> 02:00:44,370
like the idea of mortality seems to be a
little fuzzy as well it doesn't maybe

02:00:44,370 --> 02:00:44,380
little fuzzy as well it doesn't maybe

there's not a clear and the quasi idea

there's not a clear and the quasi idea

existence how do you know that like that
 

6261
02:00:52,480 --> 02:00:55,930
existence how do you know that like that
it's not computable because you're

02:00:55,930 --> 02:00:55,940
it's not computable because you're

it's not computable because you're
saying it's good it's no process the

the leg Sweetman from yesterday is the

the leg Sweetman from yesterday is the

02:01:04,850 --> 02:01:06,310
him so if you want to upload it's very
easy you make a machine that thinks it's

easy you make a machine that thinks it's

easy you make a machine that thinks it's
you because this the same thing that you

are you are a machine that thinks it's
you but that's that's more and that's

6280
02:01:11,410 --> 02:01:11,420
you but that's that's more and that's
 

6281
02:01:11,420 --> 02:01:13,960
you but that's that's more and that's
immortality yeah but it's just a belief

6282
02:01:13,960 --> 02:01:13,970
immortality yeah but it's just a belief
 

6283
02:01:13,970 --> 02:01:15,550
immortality yeah but it's just a belief
you can create this body very easily

6284
02:01:15,550 --> 02:01:15,560
you can create this body very easily
 

6285
02:01:15,560 --> 02:01:17,860
you can create this body very easily
once you realize that the question

6286
02:01:17,860 --> 02:01:17,870
once you realize that the question
 

6287
02:01:17,870 --> 02:01:20,230
once you realize that the question
whether you are immortal or not depends

6288
02:01:20,230 --> 02:01:20,240
whether you are immortal or not depends
 

6289
02:01:20,240 --> 02:01:22,360
whether you are immortal or not depends
entirely on your beliefs and your own

6290
02:01:22,360 --> 02:01:22,370
entirely on your beliefs and your own
 

6291
02:01:22,370 --> 02:01:25,240
entirely on your beliefs and your own
continuity but then it then then you can

6292
02:01:25,240 --> 02:01:25,250
continuity but then it then then you can
 

6293
02:01:25,250 --> 02:01:27,880
continuity but then it then then you can
be immortal by the continuity of the

6294
02:01:27,880 --> 02:01:27,890
be immortal by the continuity of the
 

6295
02:01:27,890 --> 02:01:30,370
be immortal by the continuity of the
belief you cannot be immortal but you

6296
02:01:30,370 --> 02:01:30,380
belief you cannot be immortal but you
 

6297
02:01:30,380 --> 02:01:32,590
belief you cannot be immortal but you
can stop being afraid of your mortality

6298
02:01:32,590 --> 02:01:32,600
can stop being afraid of your mortality
 

6299
02:01:32,600 --> 02:01:34,150
can stop being afraid of your mortality
because you realize you were never

6300
02:01:34,150 --> 02:01:34,160
because you realize you were never

this brain of legs Freedman but it's

6338
02:02:15,430 --> 02:02:15,440
this brain of legs Freedman but it's
 

6339
02:02:15,440 --> 02:02:18,280
this brain of legs Freedman but it's
it's not a real thing it's a construct

6340
02:02:18,280 --> 02:02:18,290
it's not a real thing it's a construct
 

6341
02:02:18,290 --> 02:02:20,290
it's not a real thing it's a construct
it's an idea and you can change that

6342
02:02:20,290 --> 02:02:20,300
it's an idea and you can change that
 

6343
02:02:20,300 --> 02:02:23,440
it's an idea and you can change that
idea and if you let go of this idea if

idea and if you let go of this idea if
 

6345

you don't think that you are special you
 

6347
02:02:25,280 --> 02:02:27,700
you don't think that you are special you
realize it's just one of many people and

6348
02:02:27,700 --> 02:02:27,710
realize it's just one of many people and
 

6349
02:02:27,710 --> 02:02:29,380
realize it's just one of many people and
it's not your favorite person even right

6350
02:02:29,380 --> 02:02:29,390
it's not your favorite person even right
 

6351
02:02:29,390 --> 02:02:31,750
it's not your favorite person even right
it's just one of many and it's the one

6352
02:02:31,750 --> 02:02:31,760
it's just one of many and it's the one
 

6353
02:02:31,760 --> 02:02:33,610
it's just one of many and it's the one
that you are doomed to control for the

6354
02:02:33,610 --> 02:02:33,620
that you are doomed to control for the
 

6355
02:02:33,620 --> 02:02:34,930
that you are doomed to control for the
most part and that is basically

6356
02:02:34,930 --> 02:02:34,940
most part and that is basically
 

6357
02:02:34,940 --> 02:02:37,420
most part and that is basically
informing the actions of this organism

6358
02:02:37,420 --> 02:02:37,430
informing the actions of this organism
 

6359
02:02:37,430 --> 02:02:39,880
informing the actions of this organism
yeah as a control model and this is all

6360
02:02:39,880 --> 02:02:39,890
yeah as a control model and this is all
 

6361
02:02:39,890 --> 02:02:42,490
yeah as a control model and this is all
there is and you are somehow afraid that

6362
02:02:42,490 --> 02:02:42,500
there is and you are somehow afraid that
 

6363
02:02:42,500 --> 02:02:45,070
there is and you are somehow afraid that
this control model gets interrupted or

6364
02:02:45,070 --> 02:02:45,080
this control model gets interrupted or
 

6365
02:02:45,080 --> 02:02:47,590
this control model gets interrupted or
loses the identity of continuity

6366
02:02:47,590 --> 02:02:47,600
loses the identity of continuity
 

6367
02:02:47,600 --> 02:02:50,590
loses the identity of continuity
yeah so I'm attached I mean yeah there

6368
02:02:50,590 --> 02:02:50,600
yeah so I'm attached I mean yeah there
 

6369
02:02:50,600 --> 02:02:51,700
yeah so I'm attached I mean yeah there
is a very popular

6370
02:02:51,700 --> 02:02:51,710
is a very popular
 

6371
02:02:51,710 --> 02:02:53,830
is a very popular
it's a somehow compelling notion that

6372
02:02:53,830 --> 02:02:53,840
it's a somehow compelling notion that
 

6373
02:02:53,840 --> 02:02:56,560
it's a somehow compelling notion that
being being attached like there's no

6374
02:02:56,560 --> 02:02:56,570
being being attached like there's no
 

6375
02:02:56,570 --> 02:02:59,140
being being attached like there's no
need to be attached to this idea of an

6376
02:02:59,140 --> 02:02:59,150
need to be attached to this idea of an
 

6377
02:02:59,150 --> 02:03:02,690
need to be attached to this idea of an
identity

6378
02:03:02,690 --> 02:03:02,700

 

6379
02:03:02,700 --> 02:03:05,550

but that in itself could be a an

6380
02:03:05,550 --> 02:03:05,560
but that in itself could be a an
 

6381
02:03:05,560 --> 02:03:06,960
but that in itself could be a an
illusion that you construct so the

6382
02:03:06,960 --> 02:03:06,970
illusion that you construct so the
 

6383
02:03:06,970 --> 02:03:09,000
illusion that you construct so the
process of meditation while popular is

6384
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:09,010
process of meditation while popular is
 

6385
02:03:09,010 --> 02:03:11,580
process of meditation while popular is
thought of as getting under the concept

6386
02:03:11,580 --> 02:03:11,590
thought of as getting under the concept
 

6387
02:03:11,590 --> 02:03:13,530
thought of as getting under the concept
of identity it could be just putting a

6388
02:03:13,530 --> 02:03:13,540
of identity it could be just putting a
 

6389
02:03:13,540 --> 02:03:15,840
of identity it could be just putting a
cloak over it just telling it to be

6390
02:03:15,840 --> 02:03:15,850
cloak over it just telling it to be
 

6391
02:03:15,850 --> 02:03:21,900
cloak over it just telling it to be
quiet for the moment you know it I think

6392
02:03:21,900 --> 02:03:21,910
quiet for the moment you know it I think
 

6393
02:03:21,910 --> 02:03:23,370
quiet for the moment you know it I think
that meditation is eventually just a

6394
02:03:23,370 --> 02:03:23,380
that meditation is eventually just a
 

6395
02:03:23,380 --> 02:03:25,050
that meditation is eventually just a
bunch of techniques that let you control

6396
02:03:25,050 --> 02:03:25,060
bunch of techniques that let you control
 

6397
02:03:25,060 --> 02:03:27,360
bunch of techniques that let you control
attention and when you can control the

6398
02:03:27,360 --> 02:03:27,370
attention and when you can control the
 

6399
02:03:27,370 --> 02:03:30,000
attention and when you can control the
attention you can get access to your own

6400
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:30,010
attention you can get access to your own
 

6401
02:03:30,010 --> 02:03:31,620
attention you can get access to your own
source code hopefully not before you

6402
02:03:31,620 --> 02:03:31,630
source code hopefully not before you
 

6403
02:03:31,630 --> 02:03:33,600
source code hopefully not before you
understand what you're doing and then

6404
02:03:33,600 --> 02:03:33,610
understand what you're doing and then
 

6405
02:03:33,610 --> 02:03:34,920
understand what you're doing and then
you can change the way it works

6406
02:03:34,920 --> 02:03:34,930
you can change the way it works
 

6407
02:03:34,930 --> 02:03:36,530
you can change the way it works
temporarily or permanently

6408
02:03:36,530 --> 02:03:36,540
temporarily or permanently
 

6409
02:03:36,540 --> 02:03:39,930
temporarily or permanently
so yeah meditations in get a glimpse at

6410
02:03:39,930 --> 02:03:39,940
so yeah meditations in get a glimpse at
 

6411
02:03:39,940 --> 02:03:42,000
so yeah meditations in get a glimpse at
the source code get under there so

6412
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:42,010
the source code get under there so
 

6413
02:03:42,010 --> 02:03:44,190
the source code get under there so
basically how much role or is it that

6414
02:03:44,190 --> 02:03:44,200
basically how much role or is it that
 

6415
02:03:44,200 --> 02:03:45,930
basically how much role or is it that
you learn to control attention so yeah

6416
02:03:45,930 --> 02:03:45,940
you learn to control attention so yeah
 

6417
02:03:45,940 --> 02:03:47,520
you learn to control attention so yeah
everything else is downstream from

6418
02:03:47,520 --> 02:03:47,530
everything else is downstream from
 

6419
02:03:47,530 --> 02:03:49,380
everything else is downstream from
controlling attention and control the

6420
02:03:49,380 --> 02:03:49,390
controlling attention and control the
 

6421
02:03:49,390 --> 02:03:51,360
controlling attention and control the
attention that's looking at the

6422
02:03:51,360 --> 02:03:51,370
attention that's looking at the
 

6423
02:03:51,370 --> 02:03:53,700
attention that's looking at the
attention not only only get attention in

6424
02:03:53,700 --> 02:03:53,710
attention not only only get attention in
 

6425
02:03:53,710 --> 02:03:55,560
attention not only only get attention in
the parts of our mind that create heat

6426
02:03:55,560 --> 02:03:55,570
the parts of our mind that create heat
 

6427
02:03:55,570 --> 02:03:57,300
the parts of our mind that create heat
where you have a mismatch between model

6428
02:03:57,300 --> 02:03:57,310
where you have a mismatch between model
 

6429
02:03:57,310 --> 02:03:59,700
where you have a mismatch between model
and the results that are happening and

6430
02:03:59,700 --> 02:03:59,710
and the results that are happening and
 

6431
02:03:59,710 --> 02:04:01,410
and the results that are happening and
so most people are not self-aware

6432
02:04:01,410 --> 02:04:01,420
so most people are not self-aware
 

6433
02:04:01,420 --> 02:04:04,320
so most people are not self-aware
because their control is too good if

6434
02:04:04,320 --> 02:04:04,330

under different circumstances maybe we

under different circumstances maybe we
have flying dreams as children because

we doing that anyway I mean not without

6613
02:07:25,800 --> 02:07:27,920

dreams and simulations in our mind as we

dreams and simulations in our mind as we
 

6617
02:07:30,810 --> 02:07:32,960
dreams and simulations in our mind as we
try to interpret the environment I mean

6618
02:07:32,960 --> 02:07:32,970
try to interpret the environment I mean
 

6619
02:07:32,970 --> 02:07:34,730
try to interpret the environment I mean
it's sort of considering all the

02:07:34,730 --> 02:07:34,740
it's sort of considering all the
 

6621
02:07:34,740 --> 02:07:36,560
it's sort of considering all the
different possibilities there's the way

02:07:36,560 --> 02:07:36,570
different possibilities there's the way
 

6623
02:07:36,570 --> 02:07:37,760

we interact with the environment it

seems like essentially like you said of

6626
02:07:44,330 --> 02:07:44,340
seems like essentially like you said of
 

6627
02:07:44,340 --> 02:07:46,310
seems like essentially like you said of
creating a bunch of simulations that are

creating a bunch of simulations that are
 

6629
02:07:46,320 --> 02:07:49,550
creating a bunch of simulations that are
consistent with our expectations with

just saw recently and through that
 

6635
02:07:56,420 --> 02:08:00,830
just saw recently and through that
hallucination process we are able to

02:08:00,830 --> 02:08:00,840
hallucination process we are able to
 

6637
02:08:00,840 --> 02:08:02,960

then somehow stitch together what

02:08:02,960 --> 02:08:02,970
then somehow stitch together what

02:08:02,970 --> 02:08:05,540
then somehow stitch together what
actually we see in the world with the

so this obsession of constantly

6663
02:08:33,990 --> 02:08:40,070

guess this is largely automatic yes but

02:08:40,070 --> 02:08:40,080
guess this is largely automatic yes but
 

6665
02:08:40,080 --> 02:08:42,380

the process is mean it's not complicated

the process is mean it's not complicated
 

6667
02:08:42,390 --> 02:08:44,600
the process is mean it's not complicated
it's very easy to pull the neural

it right so far it doesn't mean it's

it right so far it doesn't mean it's
 

6675
02:08:50,610 --> 02:08:52,130
it right so far it doesn't mean it's
hard because you can see that a

there's relatively few neurons yeah as

there's relatively few neurons yeah as
 

6681
02:08:56,370 --> 02:08:57,980
there's relatively few neurons yeah as
you build a bunch of neural oscillators

you build a bunch of neural oscillators

02:08:57,990 --> 02:08:59,330
you build a bunch of neural oscillators

dynamics of your body in such a way that
the regulator becomes isomorphic and

the regulator becomes isomorphic and

the regulator becomes isomorphic and
it's modeled through the dynamics that

it's modeled through the dynamics that

it's modeled through the dynamics that

like common sense reasoning to walk it's
 

6713
02:09:34,410 --> 02:09:36,050
like common sense reasoning to walk it's

to be to act in this world there's a

to be to act in this world there's a
 

6719
02:09:40,800 --> 02:09:44,060
to be to act in this world there's a
huge knowledge base that's underlying it

huge knowledge base that's underlying it
 

6721
02:09:44,070 --> 02:09:46,840

somehow there's so much information of

somehow there's so much information of

somehow there's so much information of

which is like it's humbling at least in

02:09:58,730 --> 02:09:58,740
which is like it's humbling at least in
 

6731
02:09:58,740 --> 02:10:00,740
which is like it's humbling at least in

my imagination the amount of information

mean what's your sense about to linger

6746
02:10:24,800 --> 02:10:24,810
mean what's your sense about to linger
 

6747
02:10:24,810 --> 02:10:27,710
mean what's your sense about to linger
on how much if you know to linger on the

on how much if you know to linger on the

02:10:30,030 --> 02:10:32,030
idea of what kind of mechanism would be
effective at walking you said just a

6752
02:10:32,030 --> 02:10:32,040
effective at walking you said just a
 

6753
02:10:32,040 --> 02:10:34,430
effective at walking you said just a
neural network not maybe the kind we

6754
02:10:34,430 --> 02:10:34,440
neural network not maybe the kind we
 

6755
02:10:34,440 --> 02:10:35,720
neural network not maybe the kind we
have but something a little bit better

6756
02:10:35,720 --> 02:10:35,730
have but something a little bit better
 

6757
02:10:35,730 --> 02:10:38,690
have but something a little bit better
we'll be able to walk easily don't you

6758
02:10:38,690 --> 02:10:38,700
we'll be able to walk easily don't you
 

6759
02:10:38,700 --> 02:10:44,720
we'll be able to walk easily don't you
think it also needs to know like a huge

6760
02:10:44,720 --> 02:10:44,730
think it also needs to know like a huge
 

6761
02:10:44,730 --> 02:10:46,490
think it also needs to know like a huge
amount of knowledge that's represented

6762
02:10:46,490 --> 02:10:46,500
amount of knowledge that's represented
 

6763
02:10:46,500 --> 02:10:48,200
amount of knowledge that's represented

02:10:48,200 --> 02:10:48,210
under the flag of common sense reasoning
 

6765
02:10:48,210 --> 02:10:49,790
under the flag of common sense reasoning
how much common sense knowledge to be

6766
02:10:49,790 --> 02:10:49,800
how much common sense knowledge to be
 

6767
02:10:49,800 --> 02:10:51,230
how much common sense knowledge to be
actually have imagine that you are

6768
02:10:51,230 --> 02:10:51,240
actually have imagine that you are
 

6769
02:10:51,240 --> 02:10:52,940
actually have imagine that you are
pretty hard working through all your

6770
02:10:52,940 --> 02:10:52,950
pretty hard working through all your
 

6771
02:10:52,950 --> 02:10:55,550
pretty hard working through all your
life and you form two new concepts every

6772
02:10:55,550 --> 02:10:55,560
life and you form two new concepts every
 

6773
02:10:55,560 --> 02:10:57,260
life and you form two new concepts every
half hour or so yes you end up with

6774
02:10:57,260 --> 02:10:57,270
half hour or so yes you end up with
 

6775
02:10:57,270 --> 02:10:58,490
half hour or so yes you end up with
something like a million concepts

6776
02:10:58,490 --> 02:10:58,500
something like a million concepts
 

6777
02:10:58,500 --> 02:11:01,190
something like a million concepts
because you don't get that old so a

6778
02:11:01,190 --> 02:11:01,200
because you don't get that old so a
 

6779
02:11:01,200 --> 02:11:05,780
because you don't get that old so a
million concept that's not a lot it's

6780
02:11:05,780 --> 02:11:05,790
million concept that's not a lot it's
 

6781
02:11:05,790 --> 02:11:07,730
million concept that's not a lot it's
not just a million concepts I think

6782
02:11:07,730 --> 02:11:07,740
not just a million concepts I think
 

6783
02:11:07,740 --> 02:11:09,530
not just a million concepts I think
you'll be a lot I personally think it

6784
02:11:09,530 --> 02:11:09,540
you'll be a lot I personally think it
 

6785
02:11:09,540 --> 02:11:11,960
you'll be a lot I personally think it
might be much more than a million if you

6786
02:11:11,960 --> 02:11:11,970
might be much more than a million if you
 

6787
02:11:11,970 --> 02:11:13,340
might be much more than a million if you
think just about the numbers

6788
02:11:13,340 --> 02:11:13,350
think just about the numbers
 

6789
02:11:13,350 --> 02:11:15,860
think just about the numbers
you don't live that long if you think

6790
02:11:15,860 --> 02:11:15,870
you don't live that long if you think
 

6791
02:11:15,870 --> 02:11:17,540
you don't live that long if you think
about how many cycles do your neurons

6792
02:11:17,540 --> 02:11:17,550
about how many cycles do your neurons
 

6793
02:11:17,550 --> 02:11:19,730
about how many cycles do your neurons
have in your life it's quite limited you

6794
02:11:19,730 --> 02:11:19,740
have in your life it's quite limited you
 

6795
02:11:19,740 --> 02:11:21,650
have in your life it's quite limited you
don't get that all yeah but the the

6796
02:11:21,650 --> 02:11:21,660
don't get that all yeah but the the
 

6797
02:11:21,660 --> 02:11:24,590
don't get that all yeah but the the
powerful thing is a number of concepts

6798
02:11:24,590 --> 02:11:24,600
powerful thing is a number of concepts
 

6799
02:11:24,600 --> 02:11:28,610
powerful thing is a number of concepts
and they're probably deeply hierarchical

6800
02:11:28,610 --> 02:11:28,620
and they're probably deeply hierarchical
 

6801
02:11:28,620 --> 02:11:31,370
and they're probably deeply hierarchical
in nature the relations as you described

6802
02:11:31,370 --> 02:11:31,380
in nature the relations as you described
 

6803
02:11:31,380 --> 02:11:34,160
in nature the relations as you described
between them is the key thing so it's

6804
02:11:34,160 --> 02:11:34,170
between them is the key thing so it's
 

6805
02:11:34,170 --> 02:11:35,990
between them is the key thing so it's
like even if it's the chameleon concepts

6806
02:11:35,990 --> 02:11:36,000
like even if it's the chameleon concepts
 

6807
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,480
like even if it's the chameleon concepts
the the graph of relations that's formed

6808
02:11:38,480 --> 02:11:38,490
the the graph of relations that's formed
 

6809
02:11:38,490 --> 02:11:41,410
the the graph of relations that's formed
and some kind of perhaps some kind of

6810
02:11:41,410 --> 02:11:41,420
and some kind of perhaps some kind of
 

6811
02:11:41,420 --> 02:11:44,330
and some kind of perhaps some kind of
probabilistic relationships that's the

6812
02:11:44,330 --> 02:11:44,340
probabilistic relationships that's the
 

6813
02:11:44,340 --> 02:11:46,490
probabilistic relationships that's the
that's what's common-sense reasoning is

6814
02:11:46,490 --> 02:11:46,500
that's what's common-sense reasoning is
 

6815
02:11:46,500 --> 02:11:49,640
that's what's common-sense reasoning is
a relationship between things that yeah

6816
02:11:49,640 --> 02:11:49,650
a relationship between things that yeah
 

6817
02:11:49,650 --> 02:11:51,290
a relationship between things that yeah
so but in some sense I think of the

6818
02:11:51,290 --> 02:11:51,300
so but in some sense I think of the
 

6819
02:11:51,300 --> 02:11:52,250
so but in some sense I think of the
concepts as the

6820
02:11:52,250 --> 02:11:52,260
concepts as the
 

6821
02:11:52,260 --> 02:11:54,920
concepts as the
space for our behavior programs and the

6822
02:11:54,920 --> 02:11:54,930
space for our behavior programs and the
 

6823
02:11:54,930 --> 02:11:56,450
space for our behavior programs and the
waiver poems allow us to recognize

6824
02:11:56,450 --> 02:11:56,460
waiver poems allow us to recognize
 

6825
02:11:56,460 --> 02:11:58,460
waiver poems allow us to recognize
objects and interact with them also

6826
02:11:58,460 --> 02:11:58,470
objects and interact with them also
 

6827
02:11:58,470 --> 02:12:00,920
objects and interact with them also
mental objects and a large part of that

6828
02:12:00,920 --> 02:12:00,930
mental objects and a large part of that
 

6829
02:12:00,930 --> 02:12:03,170
mental objects and a large part of that
is the physical world that we interact

6830
02:12:03,170 --> 02:12:03,180
is the physical world that we interact
 

6831
02:12:03,180 --> 02:12:05,090
is the physical world that we interact
with which is this res extend Lansing

6832
02:12:05,090 --> 02:12:05,100
with which is this res extend Lansing
 

6833
02:12:05,100 --> 02:12:06,830
with which is this res extend Lansing
which is basically navigation of

6834
02:12:06,830 --> 02:12:06,840
which is basically navigation of
 

6835
02:12:06,840 --> 02:12:10,610
which is basically navigation of
information in space and basically it's

6836
02:12:10,610 --> 02:12:10,620
information in space and basically it's
 

6837
02:12:10,620 --> 02:12:13,100
information in space and basically it's
similar to a game engine it's a physics

6838
02:12:13,100 --> 02:12:13,110
similar to a game engine it's a physics
 

6839
02:12:13,110 --> 02:12:16,130
similar to a game engine it's a physics
engine that you can use to describe and

6840
02:12:16,130 --> 02:12:16,140
engine that you can use to describe and
 

6841
02:12:16,140 --> 02:12:18,800
engine that you can use to describe and
predict how things that look in a

6842
02:12:18,800 --> 02:12:18,810
predict how things that look in a
 

6843
02:12:18,810 --> 02:12:20,750
predict how things that look in a
particular way that feel when you touch

6844
02:12:20,750 --> 02:12:20,760
particular way that feel when you touch
 

6845
02:12:20,760 --> 02:12:21,830
particular way that feel when you touch
them particular way they love

6846
02:12:21,830 --> 02:12:21,840
them particular way they love
 

6847
02:12:21,840 --> 02:12:23,360
them particular way they love
proprioception I love auditory

6848
02:12:23,360 --> 02:12:23,370
proprioception I love auditory
 

6849
02:12:23,370 --> 02:12:25,610
proprioception I love auditory
perception and so on how they work out

6850
02:12:25,610 --> 02:12:25,620
perception and so on how they work out
 

6851
02:12:25,620 --> 02:12:27,170
perception and so on how they work out
so basically the geometry of all these

6852
02:12:27,170 --> 02:12:27,180
so basically the geometry of all these
 

6853
02:12:27,180 --> 02:12:30,860
so basically the geometry of all these
things and this is probably 80% of what

6854
02:12:30,860 --> 02:12:30,870
things and this is probably 80% of what
 

6855
02:12:30,870 --> 02:12:32,840
things and this is probably 80% of what
our brain is doing is dealing with debt

6856
02:12:32,840 --> 02:12:32,850
our brain is doing is dealing with debt
 

6857
02:12:32,850 --> 02:12:35,270
our brain is doing is dealing with debt
with this real-time simulation and by

itself a game engine is fascinating but

6860
02:12:37,790 --> 02:12:37,800
itself a game engine is fascinating but
 

6861
02:12:37,800 --> 02:12:39,680
itself a game engine is fascinating but
it's not that hard to understand what

6862
02:12:39,680 --> 02:12:39,690
it's not that hard to understand what
 

6863
02:12:39,690 --> 02:12:41,210
it's not that hard to understand what
it's doing right and our game engines

6864
02:12:41,210 --> 02:12:41,220
it's doing right and our game engines
 

6865
02:12:41,220 --> 02:12:44,930
it's doing right and our game engines
are already in some sense approximating

6866
02:12:44,930 --> 02:12:44,940
are already in some sense approximating
 

6867
02:12:44,940 --> 02:12:47,450
are already in some sense approximating
the Magna deep fidelity of what we can

6868
02:12:47,450 --> 02:12:47,460
the Magna deep fidelity of what we can
 

6869
02:12:47,460 --> 02:12:51,470
the Magna deep fidelity of what we can
perceive so if we put on an oculus quest

we get something that is still

we get something that is still

we get something that is still
qualitatively crude with respect to what

qualitatively crude with respect to what
 

6875
02:12:54,990 --> 02:12:56,540
qualitatively crude with respect to what
we can perceive but it's also in the

6877
02:12:56,550 --> 02:12:58,640

interaction social interaction is it's
 

6907
02:13:29,580 --> 02:13:31,760
interaction social interaction is it's
not so hard it's just hard for us nerds

6908
02:13:31,760 --> 02:13:31,770
not so hard it's just hard for us nerds
 

6909
02:13:31,770 --> 02:13:33,680
not so hard it's just hard for us nerds
because we all have our wires crossed so

6910
02:13:33,680 --> 02:13:33,690
because we all have our wires crossed so
 

6911
02:13:33,690 --> 02:13:36,050
because we all have our wires crossed so
we need to use them but the priors are

6912
02:13:36,050 --> 02:13:36,060
we need to use them but the priors are
 

6913
02:13:36,060 --> 02:13:38,570
we need to use them but the priors are
present in most social animals so it's

6914
02:13:38,570 --> 02:13:38,580
present in most social animals so it's
 

6915
02:13:38,580 --> 02:13:40,750
present in most social animals so it's
interesting thing to notice that many

6916
02:13:40,750 --> 02:13:40,760
interesting thing to notice that many
 

6917
02:13:40,760 --> 02:13:43,940
interesting thing to notice that many
domestic social animals like cats and

6918
02:13:43,940 --> 02:13:43,950
domestic social animals like cats and
 

6919
02:13:43,950 --> 02:13:45,920
domestic social animals like cats and
dogs have better social cognition than

6920
02:13:45,920 --> 02:13:45,930
dogs have better social cognition than
 

6921
02:13:45,930 --> 02:13:50,330
dogs have better social cognition than
children right I hope so I hope it's not

6922
02:13:50,330 --> 02:13:50,340
children right I hope so I hope it's not
 

6923
02:13:50,340 --> 02:13:53,060
children right I hope so I hope it's not
that many concepts fundamentally and -

02:13:55,440 --> 02:13:57,680
due to existence world social sorry it's
more like I'm afraid so because this

6928
02:13:57,680 --> 02:13:57,690
more like I'm afraid so because this
 

6929
02:13:57,690 --> 02:14:00,260
more like I'm afraid so because this
thing that we only appear to be so

6930
02:14:00,260 --> 02:14:00,270
thing that we only appear to be so
 

6931
02:14:00,270 --> 02:14:01,820
thing that we only appear to be so
complex to each other because we are so

6932
02:14:01,820 --> 02:14:01,830
complex to each other because we are so
 

6933
02:14:01,830 --> 02:14:04,069
complex to each other because we are so
stupid it's a little bit interesting

6934
02:14:04,069 --> 02:14:04,079
stupid it's a little bit interesting
 

6935
02:14:04,079 --> 02:14:06,620
stupid it's a little bit interesting
now one that yeah to me that's inspiring

6936
02:14:06,620 --> 02:14:06,630
now one that yeah to me that's inspiring
 

6937
02:14:06,630 --> 02:14:10,609
now one that yeah to me that's inspiring
if we're indeed as as as stupid as it

6938
02:14:10,609 --> 02:14:10,619
if we're indeed as as as stupid as it
 

6939
02:14:10,619 --> 02:14:12,649
if we're indeed as as as stupid as it
seems so thinks our brains don't scale

6940
02:14:12,649 --> 02:14:12,659
seems so thinks our brains don't scale
 

6941
02:14:12,659 --> 02:14:14,330
seems so thinks our brains don't scale
and the information processing that we

6942
02:14:14,330 --> 02:14:14,340
and the information processing that we
 

6943
02:14:14,340 --> 02:14:17,439
and the information processing that we
built tend to scale very well yeah but I

6944
02:14:17,439 --> 02:14:17,449
built tend to scale very well yeah but I
 

6945
02:14:17,449 --> 02:14:19,879
built tend to scale very well yeah but I
mean one of the things that worries me

6946
02:14:19,879 --> 02:14:19,889
mean one of the things that worries me
 

6947
02:14:19,889 --> 02:14:22,640
mean one of the things that worries me
is that the you know that the fact that

6948
02:14:22,640 --> 02:14:22,650
is that the you know that the fact that
 

6949
02:14:22,650 --> 02:14:24,740
is that the you know that the fact that
the brain doesn't scale means that

6950
02:14:24,740 --> 02:14:24,750
the brain doesn't scale means that
 

6951
02:14:24,750 --> 02:14:26,299
the brain doesn't scale means that
that's actually a fundamental feature of

6952
02:14:26,299 --> 02:14:26,309
that's actually a fundamental feature of
 

6953
02:14:26,309 --> 02:14:29,540
that's actually a fundamental feature of
the brain you know the all the flaws of

6954
02:14:29,540 --> 02:14:29,550
the brain you know the all the flaws of
 

6955
02:14:29,550 --> 02:14:31,339
the brain you know the all the flaws of
the brain everything we see that we see

6956
02:14:31,339 --> 02:14:31,349
the brain everything we see that we see
 

6957
02:14:31,349 --> 02:14:32,750
the brain everything we see that we see
has limitations perhaps there's a

6958
02:14:32,750 --> 02:14:32,760
has limitations perhaps there's a
 

6959
02:14:32,760 --> 02:14:34,760
has limitations perhaps there's a
fundamental the constraints on the

6960
02:14:34,760 --> 02:14:34,770
fundamental the constraints on the
 

6961
02:14:34,770 --> 02:14:38,720
fundamental the constraints on the
system could be the requirement of its

02:14:38,720 --> 02:14:38,730
system could be the requirement of its
 

6963
02:14:38,730 --> 02:14:42,560

02:14:47,089 --> 02:14:47,099
systems were scale especially with deep

mind all the major results really have

6974
02:14:55,549 --> 02:14:55,559
mind all the major results really have
 

6975
02:14:55,559 --> 02:14:59,689
mind all the major results really have
to do with huge compute and it also be

6976
02:14:59,689 --> 02:14:59,699
to do with huge compute and it also be
 

6977
02:14:59,699 --> 02:15:01,399
to do with huge compute and it also be
that our brains are so small not just

6978
02:15:01,399 --> 02:15:01,409
that our brains are so small not just
 

6979
02:15:01,409 --> 02:15:03,589
that our brains are so small not just
because they take up so much glucose in

6980
02:15:03,589 --> 02:15:03,599
because they take up so much glucose in
 

6981
02:15:03,599 --> 02:15:06,080
because they take up so much glucose in
our body like 20% of the glucose so they

6982
02:15:06,080 --> 02:15:06,090
our body like 20% of the glucose so they
 

6983
02:15:06,090 --> 02:15:08,049
our body like 20% of the glucose so they
don't arbitrarily scale there's some

6984
02:15:08,049 --> 02:15:08,059
don't arbitrarily scale there's some
 

6985
02:15:08,059 --> 02:15:10,490
don't arbitrarily scale there's some
animals like elephants which have larger

6986
02:15:10,490 --> 02:15:10,500
animals like elephants which have larger
 

6987
02:15:10,500 --> 02:15:11,870
animals like elephants which have larger
brains than us and atoms need to be

6988
02:15:11,870 --> 02:15:11,880

6989
02:15:11,880 --> 02:15:13,760

smarter all right elephants seem to be

6990
02:15:13,760 --> 02:15:13,770
smarter all right elephants seem to be
 

6991
02:15:13,770 --> 02:15:15,620
smarter all right elephants seem to be
autistic they have very very good motor

6992
02:15:15,620 --> 02:15:15,630
autistic they have very very good motor
 

6993
02:15:15,630 --> 02:15:16,879
autistic they have very very good motor
control and they're really good with

6994
02:15:16,879 --> 02:15:16,889
control and they're really good with
 

6995
02:15:16,889 --> 02:15:19,010
control and they're really good with
details but they really struggle to see

6996
02:15:19,010 --> 02:15:19,020
details but they really struggle to see
 

6997
02:15:19,020 --> 02:15:20,740
details but they really struggle to see
the big picture so you can make them

6998
02:15:20,740 --> 02:15:20,750
the big picture so you can make them
 

6999
02:15:20,750 --> 02:15:23,870
the big picture so you can make them
recreate drawings stroke by stroke they

7000
02:15:23,870 --> 02:15:23,880
recreate drawings stroke by stroke they
 

7001
02:15:23,880 --> 02:15:26,600
recreate drawings stroke by stroke they
can do that but they cannot reproduce a

7002
02:15:26,600 --> 02:15:26,610
can do that but they cannot reproduce a
 

7003
02:15:26,610 --> 02:15:28,549
can do that but they cannot reproduce a
still life so they cannot make a drawing

7004
02:15:28,549 --> 02:15:28,559
still life so they cannot make a drawing
 

7005
02:15:28,559 --> 02:15:29,899
still life so they cannot make a drawing
of a scene that I see there will always

7006
02:15:29,899 --> 02:15:29,909
of a scene that I see there will always
 

7007
02:15:29,909 --> 02:15:32,419
of a scene that I see there will always
be only able to reproduce the line drawn

7008
02:15:32,419 --> 02:15:32,429
be only able to reproduce the line drawn
 

7009
02:15:32,429 --> 02:15:33,709
be only able to reproduce the line drawn
at least as far away from what I could

7010
02:15:33,709 --> 02:15:33,719
at least as far away from what I could
 

7011
02:15:33,719 --> 02:15:37,160
at least as far away from what I could
see in the experiments yeah by is that

7012
02:15:37,160 --> 02:15:37,170
see in the experiments yeah by is that
 

7013
02:15:37,170 --> 02:15:39,229
see in the experiments yeah by is that
maybe smarter elephants would meditate

7014
02:15:39,229 --> 02:15:39,239
maybe smarter elephants would meditate
 

7015
02:15:39,239 --> 02:15:40,910
maybe smarter elephants would meditate
themselves out of existence because

7016
02:15:40,910 --> 02:15:40,920
themselves out of existence because
 

7017
02:15:40,920 --> 02:15:42,290
themselves out of existence because
their brains are too large so they

7018
02:15:42,290 --> 02:15:42,300
their brains are too large so they
 

7019
02:15:42,300 --> 02:15:43,700
their brains are too large so they
basically the elephants that were not

7020
02:15:43,700 --> 02:15:43,710
basically the elephants that were not
 

7021
02:15:43,710 --> 02:15:47,149
basically the elephants that were not
autistic they didn't reproduce yet so we

7022
02:15:47,149 --> 02:15:47,159
autistic they didn't reproduce yet so we
 

7023
02:15:47,159 --> 02:15:48,200
autistic they didn't reproduce yet so we
have to remember that the brain is

7024
02:15:48,200 --> 02:15:48,210
have to remember that the brain is
 

7025
02:15:48,210 --> 02:15:50,060
have to remember that the brain is
fundamentally interlinked with the body

7026
02:15:50,060 --> 02:15:50,070
fundamentally interlinked with the body
 

7027
02:15:50,070 --> 02:15:52,280
fundamentally interlinked with the body
and our human and biological system do

7028
02:15:52,280 --> 02:15:52,290
and our human and biological system do
 

7029
02:15:52,290 --> 02:15:54,770
and our human and biological system do
you think that a GI systems that we try

7030
02:15:54,770 --> 02:15:54,780
you think that a GI systems that we try
 

7031
02:15:54,780 --> 02:15:55,790
you think that a GI systems that we try
to create or greater intelligence

7032
02:15:55,790 --> 02:15:55,800
to create or greater intelligence
 

7033
02:15:55,800 --> 02:15:59,000
to create or greater intelligence
systems would need to have a body so I

7034
02:15:59,000 --> 02:15:59,010
systems would need to have a body so I
 

7035
02:15:59,010 --> 02:16:00,500
systems would need to have a body so I
think that should be able to make use of

7036
02:16:00,500 --> 02:16:00,510
think that should be able to make use of
 

7037
02:16:00,510 --> 02:16:03,319
think that should be able to make use of
a body if you give it to them but I

7038
02:16:03,319 --> 02:16:03,329
a body if you give it to them but I
 

7039
02:16:03,329 --> 02:16:04,640
a body if you give it to them but I
don't think that a fundamentally new

7040
02:16:04,640 --> 02:16:04,650
don't think that a fundamentally new
 

7041
02:16:04,650 --> 02:16:07,189
don't think that a fundamentally new
body so I suspect if you can interact

7042
02:16:07,189 --> 02:16:07,199
body so I suspect if you can interact
 

7043
02:16:07,199 --> 02:16:09,830
body so I suspect if you can interact
with the world by moving your eyes and

7044
02:16:09,830 --> 02:16:09,840
with the world by moving your eyes and
 

7045
02:16:09,840 --> 02:16:11,959
with the world by moving your eyes and
your head you can make controlled

7046
02:16:11,959 --> 02:16:11,969
your head you can make controlled
 

7047
02:16:11,969 --> 02:16:14,109
your head you can make controlled
experiments and this allows you to have

7048
02:16:14,109 --> 02:16:14,119
experiments and this allows you to have
 

7049
02:16:14,119 --> 02:16:18,170
experiments and this allows you to have
many magnitudes fewer observations

7050
02:16:18,170 --> 02:16:18,180
many magnitudes fewer observations
 

7051
02:16:18,180 --> 02:16:20,840
many magnitudes fewer observations
in order to reduce the uncertainty in

7052
02:16:20,840 --> 02:16:20,850
in order to reduce the uncertainty in
 

7053
02:16:20,850 --> 02:16:22,880
in order to reduce the uncertainty in
your models alright so you can pinpoint

7054
02:16:22,880 --> 02:16:22,890
your models alright so you can pinpoint
 

7055
02:16:22,890 --> 02:16:24,290
your models alright so you can pinpoint
the areas in your models but you're not

7056
02:16:24,290 --> 02:16:24,300
the areas in your models but you're not
 

7057
02:16:24,300 --> 02:16:25,310
the areas in your models but you're not
quite sure and you just move your head

7058
02:16:25,310 --> 02:16:25,320
quite sure and you just move your head
 

7059
02:16:25,320 --> 02:16:27,350
quite sure and you just move your head
and see what's doing what's going on

7060
02:16:27,350 --> 02:16:27,360
and see what's doing what's going on
 

7061
02:16:27,360 --> 02:16:28,400
and see what's doing what's going on
over there and you get additional

7062
02:16:28,400 --> 02:16:28,410
over there and you get additional
 

7063
02:16:28,410 --> 02:16:30,440
over there and you get additional
information if you just have to use

7064
02:16:30,440 --> 02:16:30,450
information if you just have to use
 

7065
02:16:30,450 --> 02:16:32,270
information if you just have to use
YouTube as an input and you cannot do

7066
02:16:32,270 --> 02:16:32,280
YouTube as an input and you cannot do
 

7067
02:16:32,280 --> 02:16:34,459
YouTube as an input and you cannot do
anything beyond this you probably need

7068
02:16:34,459 --> 02:16:34,469
anything beyond this you probably need
 

7069
02:16:34,469 --> 02:16:36,830
anything beyond this you probably need
just much more data but if we have much

7070
02:16:36,830 --> 02:16:36,840
just much more data but if we have much
 

7071
02:16:36,840 --> 02:16:39,500
just much more data but if we have much
more data so if you can build a system

7072
02:16:39,500 --> 02:16:39,510
more data so if you can build a system
 

7073
02:16:39,510 --> 02:16:41,240
more data so if you can build a system
that has enough time and attention to

7074
02:16:41,240 --> 02:16:41,250
that has enough time and attention to
 

7075
02:16:41,250 --> 02:16:43,550
that has enough time and attention to
browse all of YouTube and extract all

7076
02:16:43,550 --> 02:16:43,560
browse all of YouTube and extract all
 

7077
02:16:43,560 --> 02:16:44,780
browse all of YouTube and extract all
the information that there is to be

7078
02:16:44,780 --> 02:16:44,790
the information that there is to be
 

7079
02:16:44,790 --> 02:16:46,790
the information that there is to be
found I don't think that's an obvious

7080
02:16:46,790 --> 02:16:46,800
found I don't think that's an obvious
 

7081
02:16:46,800 --> 02:16:49,850
found I don't think that's an obvious
limit to what it can do yeah but it

7082
02:16:49,850 --> 02:16:49,860
limit to what it can do yeah but it
 

7083
02:16:49,860 --> 02:16:51,500
limit to what it can do yeah but it
seems that the interactivity is a

7084
02:16:51,500 --> 02:16:51,510
seems that the interactivity is a
 

7085
02:16:51,510 --> 02:16:53,540
seems that the interactivity is a
fundamental thing that the physical body

7086
02:16:53,540 --> 02:16:53,550
fundamental thing that the physical body
 

7087
02:16:53,550 --> 02:16:55,490
fundamental thing that the physical body
allows you to do but let me ask on that

7088
02:16:55,490 --> 02:16:55,500
allows you to do but let me ask on that
 

7089
02:16:55,500 --> 02:16:57,680
allows you to do but let me ask on that
topic sort of that does what a body is

7090
02:16:57,680 --> 02:16:57,690
topic sort of that does what a body is
 

7091
02:16:57,690 --> 02:16:59,930
topic sort of that does what a body is
is allowing the brain to like touch

7092
02:16:59,930 --> 02:16:59,940
is allowing the brain to like touch
 

7093
02:16:59,940 --> 02:17:01,760
is allowing the brain to like touch
things and move things and interact with

7094
02:17:01,760 --> 02:17:01,770
things and move things and interact with
 

7095
02:17:01,770 --> 02:17:05,300
things and move things and interact with
the weather the physical world exists or

about a virtual world do you think do

02:17:13,610 --> 02:17:13,620
about a virtual world do you think do
 

7105
02:17:13,620 --> 02:17:15,200
about a virtual world do you think do
you think we can do the same kind of

we put on a VR headset and move over to
 

7111
02:17:22,980 --> 02:17:24,709
we put on a VR headset and move over to
that world do you think there's any

02:17:24,709 --> 02:17:24,719
that world do you think there's any
 

7113
02:17:24,719 --> 02:17:26,660
that world do you think there's any

probably will not develop general
 

7133
02:17:44,190 --> 02:17:46,129

for us it's not yet clear if we are

for us it's not yet clear if we are
 

7143
02:17:52,770 --> 02:17:54,470
for us it's not yet clear if we are
smart enough to put AI and understand

02:17:54,470 --> 02:17:54,480
smart enough to put AI and understand
 

7145
02:17:54,480 --> 02:17:57,050
smart enough to put AI and understand
our own nature to this degree right so

this project are marginal because you're

7156
02:18:06,169 --> 02:18:06,179
this project are marginal because you're
 

7157
02:18:06,179 --> 02:18:08,030
this project are marginal because you're
probably not going to succeed in it and

7158
02:18:08,030 --> 02:18:08,040
probably not going to succeed in it and

02:18:11,660 --> 02:18:11,670
complete dedication of your entire life
 

7163
02:18:11,670 --> 02:18:13,820
complete dedication of your entire life
all right but it seems like the

7164
02:18:13,820 --> 02:18:13,830
all right but it seems like the
 

7165
02:18:13,830 --> 02:18:15,260
all right but it seems like the
possibilities of what you can do in a

7166
02:18:15,260 --> 02:18:15,270
possibilities of what you can do in a
 

7167
02:18:15,270 --> 02:18:17,600
possibilities of what you can do in a
virtual world so imagine a cut is much

7168
02:18:17,600 --> 02:18:17,610
virtual world so imagine a cut is much
 

7169
02:18:17,610 --> 02:18:19,310
virtual world so imagine a cut is much
greater than you can in the real world

7170
02:18:19,310 --> 02:18:19,320
greater than you can in the real world
 

7171
02:18:19,320 --> 02:18:22,100
greater than you can in the real world
so imagine a situation maybe interesting

7172
02:18:22,100 --> 02:18:22,110
so imagine a situation maybe interesting
 

7173
02:18:22,110 --> 02:18:23,810
so imagine a situation maybe interesting
option for me if somebody came to me and

7174
02:18:23,810 --> 02:18:23,820
option for me if somebody came to me and
 

7175
02:18:23,820 --> 02:18:28,850
option for me if somebody came to me and
offered what I'll do is yeah so from now

7176
02:18:28,850 --> 02:18:28,860
offered what I'll do is yeah so from now
 

7177
02:18:28,860 --> 02:18:30,709
offered what I'll do is yeah so from now
on you can only exist in the virtual

7178
02:18:30,709 --> 02:18:30,719
on you can only exist in the virtual
 

7179
02:18:30,719 --> 02:18:31,339
on you can only exist in the virtual
world

7180
02:18:31,339 --> 02:18:31,349
world
 

7181
02:18:31,349 --> 02:18:34,429
world
and so you put on this headset and when

7182
02:18:34,429 --> 02:18:34,439
and so you put on this headset and when
 

7183
02:18:34,439 --> 02:18:36,740
and so you put on this headset and when
you eat we'll make sure to connect your

7184
02:18:36,740 --> 02:18:36,750
you eat we'll make sure to connect your
 

7185
02:18:36,750 --> 02:18:39,769
you eat we'll make sure to connect your
body up in a way that when you eat in

7186
02:18:39,769 --> 02:18:39,779
body up in a way that when you eat in
 

7187
02:18:39,779 --> 02:18:42,080
body up in a way that when you eat in
the virtual world your body will be

7188
02:18:42,080 --> 02:18:42,090
the virtual world your body will be
 

7189
02:18:42,090 --> 02:18:43,459
the virtual world your body will be
nourished in the same way in the virtual

7190
02:18:43,459 --> 02:18:43,469
nourished in the same way in the virtual
 

7191
02:18:43,469 --> 02:18:46,160
nourished in the same way in the virtual
world so the aligning incentives between

7192
02:18:46,160 --> 02:18:46,170
world so the aligning incentives between
 

7193
02:18:46,170 --> 02:18:48,500
world so the aligning incentives between
the our common sort of real world in the

7194
02:18:48,500 --> 02:18:48,510
the our common sort of real world in the
 

7195
02:18:48,510 --> 02:18:50,599
the our common sort of real world in the
virtual world but then the possibilities

7196
02:18:50,599 --> 02:18:50,609
virtual world but then the possibilities
 

7197
02:18:50,609 --> 02:18:53,750
virtual world but then the possibilities
become much bigger like I could be other

7198
02:18:53,750 --> 02:18:53,760
become much bigger like I could be other
 

7199
02:18:53,760 --> 02:18:56,540
become much bigger like I could be other
kinds of creatures I could do I can

7200
02:18:56,540 --> 02:18:56,550
kinds of creatures I could do I can
 

7201
02:18:56,550 --> 02:18:58,040
kinds of creatures I could do I can
break the laws of physics as we know

7202
02:18:58,040 --> 02:18:58,050
break the laws of physics as we know
 

7203
02:18:58,050 --> 02:18:59,899
break the laws of physics as we know
them I can do a lot I mean the

7204
02:18:59,899 --> 02:18:59,909
them I can do a lot I mean the
 

7205
02:18:59,909 --> 02:19:01,609
them I can do a lot I mean the
possibilities are endless right it

7206
02:19:01,609 --> 02:19:01,619
possibilities are endless right it
 

7207
02:19:01,619 --> 02:19:03,889
possibilities are endless right it
that's as far as we think it's an

7208
02:19:03,889 --> 02:19:03,899
that's as far as we think it's an
 

7209
02:19:03,899 --> 02:19:06,410
that's as far as we think it's an
interesting thought whether like what

7210
02:19:06,410 --> 02:19:06,420
interesting thought whether like what
 

7211
02:19:06,420 --> 02:19:08,689
interesting thought whether like what
existence would be like what kind of

7212
02:19:08,689 --> 02:19:08,699
existence would be like what kind of
 

7213
02:19:08,699 --> 02:19:11,149
existence would be like what kind of
intelligence would emerge there what

7214
02:19:11,149 --> 02:19:11,159
intelligence would emerge there what
 

7215
02:19:11,159 --> 02:19:13,849
intelligence would emerge there what
kind of consciousness what kind of maybe

7216
02:19:13,849 --> 02:19:13,859
kind of consciousness what kind of maybe
 

7217
02:19:13,859 --> 02:19:17,450
kind of consciousness what kind of maybe

even I'm at this stage in my life if I

02:19:19,219 --> 02:19:19,229
even I'm at this stage in my life if I
 

7221
02:19:19,229 --> 02:19:21,259
even I'm at this stage in my life if I
spend the next 20 years in our world to

spend the next 20 years in our world to
 

7223
02:19:21,269 --> 02:19:24,320
spend the next 20 years in our world to
see how that intelligence emerges and if

7224
02:19:24,320 --> 02:19:24,330
see how that intelligence emerges and if
 

7225
02:19:24,330 --> 02:19:26,149
see how that intelligence emerges and if
I was if that happened at the very

I was if that happened at the very
 

7227
02:19:26,159 --> 02:19:28,009
I was if that happened at the very
beginning before I was even cognizant of

beginning before I was even cognizant of

my existence in this physical world it's

my existence in this physical world it's
interesting to think how that child

02:19:32,419 --> 02:19:32,429
interesting to think how that child
 

7233
02:19:32,429 --> 02:19:35,379
interesting to think how that child
would develop and the way virtuality and

02:19:35,379 --> 02:19:35,389
would develop and the way virtuality and
 

7235

would develop and the way virtuality and

features but that you interpret as the
 

7291
02:20:42,119 --> 02:20:44,841

initiation of an action then you are
 

7293
02:20:44,851 --> 02:20:46,580
initiation of an action then you are
the operations that you perform to make

the operations that you perform to make
 

7295
02:20:46,590 --> 02:20:48,560
the operations that you perform to make
that happen and then you see the

7296
02:20:48,560 --> 02:20:48,570
that happen and then you see the
 

7297
02:20:48,570 --> 02:20:50,810
that happen and then you see the
movement of your limbs and you learn to

7298
02:20:50,810 --> 02:20:50,820
movement of your limbs and you learn to
 

7299
02:20:50,820 --> 02:20:52,730
movement of your limbs and you learn to
associate those and thereby model your

7300
02:20:52,730 --> 02:20:52,740
associate those and thereby model your
 

7301
02:20:52,740 --> 02:20:54,890
associate those and thereby model your
own agency over this feedback right but

7302
02:20:54,890 --> 02:20:54,900
own agency over this feedback right but
 

7303
02:20:54,900 --> 02:20:56,450
own agency over this feedback right but
the first feedback that you get is from

7304
02:20:56,450 --> 02:20:56,460
the first feedback that you get is from
 

7305
02:20:56,460 --> 02:20:58,011
the first feedback that you get is from
this first order thing already basically

7306
02:20:58,011 --> 02:20:58,021
this first order thing already basically
 

7307
02:20:58,021 --> 02:21:00,080
this first order thing already basically
you decide to think a thought and the

7308
02:21:00,080 --> 02:21:00,090
you decide to think a thought and the
 

7309
02:21:00,090 --> 02:21:01,970
you decide to think a thought and the
thought is being thought you decide to

7310
02:21:01,970 --> 02:21:01,980
thought is being thought you decide to
 

7311
02:21:01,980 --> 02:21:03,680
thought is being thought you decide to
change the thought and you observe how

7312
02:21:03,680 --> 02:21:03,690
change the thought and you observe how
 

7313
02:21:03,690 --> 02:21:05,780
change the thought and you observe how
the thought is being changed yes and in

7314
02:21:05,780 --> 02:21:05,790
the thought is being changed yes and in
 

7315
02:21:05,790 --> 02:21:07,580
the thought is being changed yes and in
some sense this is you could say an

7316
02:21:07,580 --> 02:21:07,590
some sense this is you could say an
 

7317
02:21:07,590 --> 02:21:09,950
some sense this is you could say an
embodiment already right and I suspect

7318
02:21:09,950 --> 02:21:09,960
embodiment already right and I suspect
 

7319
02:21:09,960 --> 02:21:11,631
embodiment already right and I suspect
it's sufficient as an embodiment really

7320
02:21:11,631 --> 02:21:11,641
it's sufficient as an embodiment really
 

7321
02:21:11,641 --> 02:21:14,301
it's sufficient as an embodiment really
origins and so it's not that important

7322
02:21:14,301 --> 02:21:14,311
origins and so it's not that important
 

7323
02:21:14,311 --> 02:21:15,560
origins and so it's not that important
at least at this time to consider

7324
02:21:15,560 --> 02:21:15,570
at least at this time to consider
 

7325
02:21:15,570 --> 02:21:18,171
at least at this time to consider
variations in the second order yes but

7326
02:21:18,171 --> 02:21:18,181
variations in the second order yes but
 

7327
02:21:18,181 --> 02:21:21,320
variations in the second order yes but
the thing that you also put a mentioned

7328
02:21:21,320 --> 02:21:21,330
the thing that you also put a mentioned
 

7329
02:21:21,330 --> 02:21:23,810
the thing that you also put a mentioned
just now as physics that you could

7330
02:21:23,810 --> 02:21:23,820
just now as physics that you could
 

7331
02:21:23,820 --> 02:21:25,370
just now as physics that you could
change in any way you want so you need

7332
02:21:25,370 --> 02:21:25,380
change in any way you want so you need
 

7333
02:21:25,380 --> 02:21:27,440
change in any way you want so you need
an environment that puts up resistance

7334
02:21:27,440 --> 02:21:27,450
an environment that puts up resistance
 

7335
02:21:27,450 --> 02:21:29,570
an environment that puts up resistance
against you if you if there's nothing to

7336
02:21:29,570 --> 02:21:29,580
against you if you if there's nothing to
 

7337
02:21:29,580 --> 02:21:31,160
against you if you if there's nothing to
control you cannot make models right

7338
02:21:31,160 --> 02:21:31,170
control you cannot make models right
 

7339
02:21:31,170 --> 02:21:33,020
control you cannot make models right
there needs to be a particular way that

7340
02:21:33,020 --> 02:21:33,030
there needs to be a particular way that
 

7341
02:21:33,030 --> 02:21:35,631
there needs to be a particular way that
resists you and by the way your

7342
02:21:35,631 --> 02:21:35,641
resists you and by the way your
 

7343
02:21:35,641 --> 02:21:37,220
resists you and by the way your
motivation is usually outside of your

7344
02:21:37,220 --> 02:21:37,230
motivation is usually outside of your
 

7345
02:21:37,230 --> 02:21:39,261
motivation is usually outside of your
mind it resists your motivation is what

7346
02:21:39,261 --> 02:21:39,271
mind it resists your motivation is what
 

7347
02:21:39,271 --> 02:21:41,060
mind it resists your motivation is what
gets you up in the morning even though

7348
02:21:41,060 --> 02:21:41,070
gets you up in the morning even though
 

7349
02:21:41,070 --> 02:21:42,890
gets you up in the morning even though
it would be much less work to stay in

7350
02:21:42,890 --> 02:21:42,900
it would be much less work to stay in
 

7351
02:21:42,900 --> 02:21:45,980
it would be much less work to stay in
bed and so it's basically forcing you to

7352
02:21:45,980 --> 02:21:45,990
bed and so it's basically forcing you to
 

7353
02:21:45,990 --> 02:21:49,910
bed and so it's basically forcing you to
resist the environment and it forces

7354
02:21:49,910 --> 02:21:49,920
resist the environment and it forces
 

7355
02:21:49,920 --> 02:21:52,610
resist the environment and it forces
your mind to serve it to serve this

7356
02:21:52,610 --> 02:21:52,620
your mind to serve it to serve this
 

7357
02:21:52,620 --> 02:21:54,711
your mind to serve it to serve this
resistance to the environment so in some

7358
02:21:54,711 --> 02:21:54,721
resistance to the environment so in some
 

7359
02:21:54,721 --> 02:21:56,330
resistance to the environment so in some
sense it is also putting up resistance

7360
02:21:56,330 --> 02:21:56,340
sense it is also putting up resistance
 

7361
02:21:56,340 --> 02:21:58,700
sense it is also putting up resistance
against the natural tendency of the mind

7362
02:21:58,700 --> 02:21:58,710
against the natural tendency of the mind
 

7363
02:21:58,710 --> 02:22:00,890
against the natural tendency of the mind
to not do anything yeah but some of that

7364
02:22:00,890 --> 02:22:00,900
to not do anything yeah but some of that
 

7365
02:22:00,900 --> 02:22:02,211
to not do anything yeah but some of that
resistance just like you described as

7366
02:22:02,211 --> 02:22:02,221
resistance just like you described as
 

7367
02:22:02,221 --> 02:22:04,011
resistance just like you described as
motivation is like in the first order

7368
02:22:04,011 --> 02:22:04,021
motivation is like in the first order
 

7369
02:22:04,021 --> 02:22:07,610
motivation is like in the first order
space in the mind some resistance is in

7370
02:22:07,610 --> 02:22:07,620
space in the mind some resistance is in
 

7371
02:22:07,620 --> 02:22:08,961
space in the mind some resistance is in
the second order like the actual

7372
02:22:08,961 --> 02:22:08,971
the second order like the actual
 

7373
02:22:08,971 --> 02:22:10,580
the second order like the actual
physical objects pushing against you so

7374
02:22:10,580 --> 02:22:10,590
physical objects pushing against you so
 

7375
02:22:10,590 --> 02:22:12,291
physical objects pushing against you so
ah yeah it seems that the second order

7376
02:22:12,291 --> 02:22:12,301
ah yeah it seems that the second order
 

7377
02:22:12,301 --> 02:22:14,180
ah yeah it seems that the second order
stuff and virtuality could be recreated

7378
02:22:14,180 --> 02:22:14,190
stuff and virtuality could be recreated
 

7379
02:22:14,190 --> 02:22:16,910
stuff and virtuality could be recreated
of course but it might be sufficient

7380
02:22:16,910 --> 02:22:16,920
of course but it might be sufficient
 

7381
02:22:16,920 --> 02:22:18,350
of course but it might be sufficient
that you just do mathematics and

7382
02:22:18,350 --> 02:22:18,360
that you just do mathematics and
 

7383
02:22:18,360 --> 02:22:20,360
that you just do mathematics and
mathematics is already putting up enough

7384
02:22:20,360 --> 02:22:20,370
mathematics is already putting up enough
 

7385
02:22:20,370 --> 02:22:22,761
mathematics is already putting up enough
resistance against you so basically just

7386
02:22:22,761 --> 02:22:22,771
resistance against you so basically just
 

7387
02:22:22,771 --> 02:22:25,251
resistance against you so basically just
visiting a static motive this could may

7388
02:22:25,251 --> 02:22:25,261
visiting a static motive this could may
 

7389
02:22:25,261 --> 02:22:27,801
visiting a static motive this could may
be sufficient to form a type of

02:22:27,801 --> 02:22:27,811
be sufficient to form a type of

02:22:29,480 --> 02:22:29,490
intelligence it would probably not be a
 

7393
02:22:29,490 --> 02:22:31,820
intelligence it would probably not be a
very human intelligence but it might be

7394
02:22:31,820 --> 02:22:31,830
very human intelligence but it might be
 

7395
02:22:31,830 --> 02:22:35,450
very human intelligence but it might be

brain computer interfaces so again

7402
02:22:42,711 --> 02:22:42,721
brain computer interfaces so again
 

7403
02:22:42,721 --> 02:22:44,511

7409
02:22:49,471 --> 02:22:51,950
course there's a lot of trying to cure
diseases and so on with a near term but

7410
02:22:51,950 --> 02:22:51,960
diseases and so on with a near term but
 

7411
02:22:51,960 --> 02:22:54,140
diseases and so on with a near term but
the long term vision is to add an extra

7412
02:22:54,140 --> 02:22:54,150
the long term vision is to add an extra
 

7413
02:22:54,150 --> 02:22:55,910
the long term vision is to add an extra
layer to so basically expand the

7414
02:22:55,910 --> 02:22:55,920
layer to so basically expand the
 

7415
02:22:55,920 --> 02:22:57,230

aha do you think one that's possible -

aha do you think one that's possible -
how does that change the fundamentals of

02:23:06,240 --> 02:23:08,091
how does that change the fundamentals of

the zeroth order in the first order it's
 

7425
02:23:08,101 --> 02:23:09,650
the zeroth order in the first order it's
technically possible but I don't see

7426
02:23:09,650 --> 02:23:09,660
technically possible but I don't see
 

7427
02:23:09,660 --> 02:23:11,421
technically possible but I don't see
that the FDA would ever allow me to

that the FDA would ever allow me to

02:23:11,431 --> 02:23:13,160
that the FDA would ever allow me to

asking you out there philosophical and

7458
02:23:49,040 --> 02:23:49,050
legal FDA there would be enough people
 

7459
02:23:49,050 --> 02:23:50,841
legal FDA there would be enough people
that would be crazy enough to have holes

7460
02:23:50,841 --> 02:23:50,851
that would be crazy enough to have holes
 

7461
02:23:50,851 --> 02:23:52,671
that would be crazy enough to have holes
drilled in their skull to try a new type

7462
02:23:52,671 --> 02:23:52,681

7463
02:23:52,681 --> 02:23:54,500
drilled in their skull to try a new type
of brain computer interface but also if

7464
02:23:54,500 --> 02:23:54,510
of brain computer interface but also if
 

7465
02:23:54,510 --> 02:23:58,011
of brain computer interface but also if
it works it FDA will approve it I mean

7466
02:23:58,011 --> 02:23:58,021
it works it FDA will approve it I mean
 

7467
02:23:58,021 --> 02:24:01,881
it works it FDA will approve it I mean
it's the yes you're it's like exert on

7468
02:24:01,881 --> 02:24:01,891
it's the yes you're it's like exert on
 

7469
02:24:01,891 --> 02:24:03,320
it's the yes you're it's like exert on
most vehicles yes you can say that's

7470
02:24:03,320 --> 02:24:03,330
most vehicles yes you can say that's
 

7471
02:24:03,330 --> 02:24:04,881
most vehicles yes you can say that's
gonna be very difficult regulatory

7472
02:24:04,881 --> 02:24:04,891
gonna be very difficult regulatory
 

7473
02:24:04,891 --> 02:24:06,770
gonna be very difficult regulatory
process of approving with honesty but it

7474
02:24:06,770 --> 02:24:06,780
process of approving with honesty but it
 

7475
02:24:06,780 --> 02:24:08,240
process of approving with honesty but it
doesn't mean autonomous vehicles are

7476
02:24:08,240 --> 02:24:08,250
doesn't mean autonomous vehicles are
 

7477
02:24:08,250 --> 02:24:08,930
doesn't mean autonomous vehicles are
never gonna happen

7478
02:24:08,930 --> 02:24:08,940
never gonna happen
 

7479
02:24:08,940 --> 02:24:11,900
never gonna happen
so no devil totally happen as soon as we

7480
02:24:11,900 --> 02:24:11,910
so no devil totally happen as soon as we
 

7481
02:24:11,910 --> 02:24:14,270
so no devil totally happen as soon as we
create jobs for at least we lawyers and

7482
02:24:14,270 --> 02:24:14,280
create jobs for at least we lawyers and
 

7483
02:24:14,280 --> 02:24:18,921
create jobs for at least we lawyers and
one regulator per car yes lawyers that's

7484
02:24:18,921 --> 02:24:18,931
one regulator per car yes lawyers that's
 

7485
02:24:18,931 --> 02:24:22,330
one regulator per car yes lawyers that's
actually like lawyers is the fundamental

7486
02:24:22,330 --> 02:24:22,340
actually like lawyers is the fundamental
 

7487
02:24:22,340 --> 02:24:26,930
actually like lawyers is the fundamental
substrate of reality it's a very good

7488
02:24:26,930 --> 02:24:26,940
substrate of reality it's a very good
 

7489
02:24:26,940 --> 02:24:28,610
substrate of reality it's a very good
system it's not Universal in the world

7490
02:24:28,610 --> 02:24:28,620
system it's not Universal in the world
 

7491
02:24:28,620 --> 02:24:31,160
system it's not Universal in the world
the law is a very interesting software

7492
02:24:31,160 --> 02:24:31,170
the law is a very interesting software
 

7493
02:24:31,170 --> 02:24:32,930
the law is a very interesting software
once you realize it right these circuits

7494
02:24:32,930 --> 02:24:32,940
once you realize it right these circuits
 

7495
02:24:32,940 --> 02:24:35,390
once you realize it right these circuits
are in some sense streams of software

7496
02:24:35,390 --> 02:24:35,400
are in some sense streams of software
 

7497
02:24:35,400 --> 02:24:37,490
are in some sense streams of software
and this is largely works by exception

7498
02:24:37,490 --> 02:24:37,500
and this is largely works by exception
 

7499
02:24:37,500 --> 02:24:39,320
and this is largely works by exception
handling so you make decisions on the

7500
02:24:39,320 --> 02:24:39,330
handling so you make decisions on the
 

7501
02:24:39,330 --> 02:24:40,940
handling so you make decisions on the
ground and they get synchronized with

7502
02:24:40,940 --> 02:24:40,950
ground and they get synchronized with
 

7503
02:24:40,950 --> 02:24:42,500
ground and they get synchronized with
the next level structure as soon as an

7504
02:24:42,500 --> 02:24:42,510
the next level structure as soon as an
 

7505
02:24:42,510 --> 02:24:46,280
the next level structure as soon as an
exception as being wrong is a yeah so so

7506
02:24:46,280 --> 02:24:46,290
exception as being wrong is a yeah so so
 

7507
02:24:46,290 --> 02:24:47,810
exception as being wrong is a yeah so so
isolates the exception handing the

7508
02:24:47,810 --> 02:24:47,820
isolates the exception handing the
 

7509
02:24:47,820 --> 02:24:50,150
isolates the exception handing the
process is very expensive especially

7510
02:24:50,150 --> 02:24:50,160
process is very expensive especially
 

7511
02:24:50,160 --> 02:24:52,091
process is very expensive especially
since it's incentivizes the lawyers for

7512
02:24:52,091 --> 02:24:52,101
since it's incentivizes the lawyers for
 

7513
02:24:52,101 --> 02:24:54,770
since it's incentivizes the lawyers for
producing lot of work for lawyers

7514
02:24:54,770 --> 02:24:54,780
producing lot of work for lawyers
 

7515
02:24:54,780 --> 02:24:56,540
producing lot of work for lawyers
yes so the exceptions are actually

7516
02:24:56,540 --> 02:24:56,550
yes so the exceptions are actually
 

7517
02:24:56,550 --> 02:25:01,100
yes so the exceptions are actually
incentivize for for firing often but but

7518
02:25:01,100 --> 02:25:01,110
incentivize for for firing often but but
 

7519
02:25:01,110 --> 02:25:03,921
incentivize for for firing often but but
to return outside of lawyers

7520
02:25:03,921 --> 02:25:03,931
to return outside of lawyers
 

7521
02:25:03,931 --> 02:25:08,690
to return outside of lawyers
is there anything fundamentally like is

7522
02:25:08,690 --> 02:25:08,700
is there anything fundamentally like is
 

7523
02:25:08,700 --> 02:25:10,411
is there anything fundamentally like is
there anything interesting insightful

7524
02:25:10,411 --> 02:25:10,421
there anything interesting insightful
 

7525
02:25:10,421 --> 02:25:13,111
there anything interesting insightful
about the possibility of this extra

7526
02:25:13,111 --> 02:25:13,121
about the possibility of this extra
 

7527
02:25:13,121 --> 02:25:15,601
about the possibility of this extra
layer of intelligence a little rain I do

7528
02:25:15,601 --> 02:25:15,611
layer of intelligence a little rain I do
 

7529
02:25:15,611 --> 02:25:17,401
layer of intelligence a little rain I do
think so but I don't think that you need

7530
02:25:17,401 --> 02:25:17,411
think so but I don't think that you need
 

7531
02:25:17,411 --> 02:25:20,551
think so but I don't think that you need
technically invasive procedures to do so

7532
02:25:20,551 --> 02:25:20,561
technically invasive procedures to do so
 

7533
02:25:20,561 --> 02:25:22,651
technically invasive procedures to do so
we can already interface with other

7534
02:25:22,651 --> 02:25:22,661
we can already interface with other
 

7535
02:25:22,661 --> 02:25:24,211
we can already interface with other
people by observing them very very

7536
02:25:24,211 --> 02:25:24,221
people by observing them very very
 

7537
02:25:24,221 --> 02:25:25,921
people by observing them very very
closely and getting in some kind of

7538
02:25:25,921 --> 02:25:25,931
closely and getting in some kind of
 

7539
02:25:25,931 --> 02:25:29,521
closely and getting in some kind of
empathetic resonance and I'm a nerd so

7540
02:25:29,521 --> 02:25:29,531
empathetic resonance and I'm a nerd so
 

7541
02:25:29,531 --> 02:25:31,291
empathetic resonance and I'm a nerd so
I'm not very good at this but I noticed

7542
02:25:31,291 --> 02:25:31,301
I'm not very good at this but I noticed
 

7543
02:25:31,301 --> 02:25:33,211
I'm not very good at this but I noticed
that people are able to do this to some

7544
02:25:33,211 --> 02:25:33,221
that people are able to do this to some
 

7545
02:25:33,221 --> 02:25:35,871
that people are able to do this to some
degree and it basically means that we

7546
02:25:35,871 --> 02:25:35,881
degree and it basically means that we
 

7547
02:25:35,881 --> 02:25:38,101
degree and it basically means that we
model an interface lay off the other

7548
02:25:38,101 --> 02:25:38,111
model an interface lay off the other
 

7549
02:25:38,111 --> 02:25:41,281
model an interface lay off the other
person in real time and it works despite

7550
02:25:41,281 --> 02:25:41,291
person in real time and it works despite
 

7551
02:25:41,291 --> 02:25:43,171
person in real time and it works despite
our neurons being slow because most of

7552
02:25:43,171 --> 02:25:43,181
our neurons being slow because most of
 

7553
02:25:43,181 --> 02:25:45,121
our neurons being slow because most of
the things that we do are built on

7554
02:25:45,121 --> 02:25:45,131
the things that we do are built on
 

7555
02:25:45,131 --> 02:25:46,771
the things that we do are built on
periodic process these two just need to

7556
02:25:46,771 --> 02:25:46,781
periodic process these two just need to
 

7557
02:25:46,781 --> 02:25:48,871
periodic process these two just need to
entrain yourself with the oscillation

7558
02:25:48,871 --> 02:25:48,881
entrain yourself with the oscillation
 

7559
02:25:48,881 --> 02:25:49,981
entrain yourself with the oscillation
that happens and if the Association

7560
02:25:49,981 --> 02:25:49,991
that happens and if the Association
 

7561
02:25:49,991 --> 02:25:52,861
that happens and if the Association
itself changes slowly enough you can

7562
02:25:52,861 --> 02:25:52,871
itself changes slowly enough you can
 

7563
02:25:52,871 --> 02:25:57,151
itself changes slowly enough you can
basically follow along right but the

7564
02:25:57,151 --> 02:25:57,161
basically follow along right but the
 

7565
02:25:57,161 --> 02:26:00,691
basically follow along right but the
bandwidth of the interaction the you

7566
02:26:00,691 --> 02:26:00,701
bandwidth of the interaction the you
 

7567
02:26:00,701 --> 02:26:02,161
bandwidth of the interaction the you
know it seems like you can do a lot more

7568
02:26:02,161 --> 02:26:02,171
know it seems like you can do a lot more
 

7569
02:26:02,171 --> 02:26:05,430
know it seems like you can do a lot more
computation one yes of course the but

7570
02:26:05,430 --> 02:26:05,440
computation one yes of course the but
 

7571
02:26:05,440 --> 02:26:06,781
computation one yes of course the but
the other thing is that the event was

7572
02:26:06,781 --> 02:26:06,791
the other thing is that the event was
 

7573
02:26:06,791 --> 02:26:08,671
the other thing is that the event was
that our brain our own mind is running

that our brain our own mind is running
 

7575
02:26:08,681 --> 02:26:10,771
that our brain our own mind is running
on is actually quite slow so the number

7576
02:26:10,771 --> 02:26:10,781
on is actually quite slow so the number
 

7577
02:26:10,781 --> 02:26:12,331
on is actually quite slow so the number
of thoughts that I can productively

7578
02:26:12,331 --> 02:26:12,341
of thoughts that I can productively
 

7579
02:26:12,341 --> 02:26:14,991
of thoughts that I can productively
think in any given day is quite limited

7580
02:26:14,991 --> 02:26:15,001
think in any given day is quite limited
 

7581
02:26:15,001 --> 02:26:17,611
think in any given day is quite limited
but it's much if they had the discipline

7582
02:26:17,611 --> 02:26:17,621
but it's much if they had the discipline
 

7583
02:26:17,621 --> 02:26:19,680
but it's much if they had the discipline
to write it down and the speed to write

7584
02:26:19,680 --> 02:26:19,690
to write it down and the speed to write
 

7585
02:26:19,690 --> 02:26:21,151
to write it down and the speed to write
it down maybe it would be a book every

7586
02:26:21,151 --> 02:26:21,161
it down maybe it would be a book every
 

7587
02:26:21,161 --> 02:26:23,251
it down maybe it would be a book every
day or so but if you think about the

7588
02:26:23,251 --> 02:26:23,261
day or so but if you think about the
 

7589
02:26:23,261 --> 02:26:25,231
day or so but if you think about the
computers that we can build the

7590
02:26:25,231 --> 02:26:25,241
computers that we can build the
 

7591
02:26:25,241 --> 02:26:27,871
computers that we can build the
magnitudes at which they operate right

7592
02:26:27,871 --> 02:26:27,881
magnitudes at which they operate right
 

7593
02:26:27,881 --> 02:26:28,921
magnitudes at which they operate right
this would be nothing it's something

7594
02:26:28,921 --> 02:26:28,931
this would be nothing it's something
 

7595
02:26:28,931 --> 02:26:30,991
this would be nothing it's something
that it can put out in a second well I

7596
02:26:30,991 --> 02:26:31,001
that it can put out in a second well I
 

7597
02:26:31,001 --> 02:26:34,591
that it can put out in a second well I
don't know so as possible sort of the

7598
02:26:34,591 --> 02:26:34,601
don't know so as possible sort of the
 

7599
02:26:34,601 --> 02:26:35,671
don't know so as possible sort of the
number of thoughts you have in your

7600
02:26:35,671 --> 02:26:35,681
number of thoughts you have in your
 

7601
02:26:35,681 --> 02:26:38,341
number of thoughts you have in your
brain is it could be several orders of

7602
02:26:38,341 --> 02:26:38,351
brain is it could be several orders of
 

7603
02:26:38,351 --> 02:26:40,231
brain is it could be several orders of
magnitude higher than what you're

02:26:40,231 --> 02:26:40,241
magnitude higher than what you're
 

7605
02:26:40,241 --> 02:26:42,211
magnitude higher than what you're
possibly able to express through your

possibly able to express through your
 

7607
02:26:42,221 --> 02:26:45,211
possibly able to express through your
fingers or through your voice like so

7608
02:26:45,211 --> 02:26:45,221
fingers or through your voice like so
 

7609
02:26:45,221 --> 02:26:46,921

most of them are going to be repetitive

7610
02:26:46,921 --> 02:26:46,931
most of them are going to be repetitive
 

7611
02:26:46,931 --> 02:26:49,531
most of them are going to be repetitive
because they how do you know that I mean

because they how do you know that I mean
 

7613
02:26:49,541 --> 02:26:51,301
because they how do you know that I mean
they have to control the same problems

02:26:51,301 --> 02:26:51,311
they have to control the same problems

02:28:13,171 --> 02:28:13,181
optimal form of government to a
 

7687
02:28:13,181 --> 02:28:15,781
optimal form of government to a
revolutionary process is an evolution

7688
02:28:15,781 --> 02:28:15,791
revolutionary process is an evolution
 

7689
02:28:15,791 --> 02:28:19,111
revolutionary process is an evolution
and so what we discover is that maybe

7690
02:28:19,111 --> 02:28:19,121
and so what we discover is that maybe
 

7691
02:28:19,121 --> 02:28:20,941
and so what we discover is that maybe
the problem of government doesn't have

7692
02:28:20,941 --> 02:28:20,951
the problem of government doesn't have
 

7693
02:28:20,951 --> 02:28:22,801
the problem of government doesn't have
stable solutions for us right as a

7694
02:28:22,801 --> 02:28:22,811
stable solutions for us right as a
 

7695
02:28:22,811 --> 02:28:24,511
stable solutions for us right as a
species because we are not designed in

7696
02:28:24,511 --> 02:28:24,521
species because we are not designed in
 

7697
02:28:24,521 --> 02:28:26,911
species because we are not designed in
such a way that we can make everybody

7698
02:28:26,911 --> 02:28:26,921
such a way that we can make everybody
 

7699
02:28:26,921 --> 02:28:29,371
such a way that we can make everybody
conform to them so but there could be

7700
02:28:29,371 --> 02:28:29,381
conform to them so but there could be
 

7701
02:28:29,381 --> 02:28:30,991
conform to them so but there could be
solutions that work under given

7702
02:28:30,991 --> 02:28:31,001
solutions that work under given
 

7703
02:28:31,001 --> 02:28:32,970
solutions that work under given
circumstances or that are the best for

7704
02:28:32,970 --> 02:28:32,980
circumstances or that are the best for
 

7705
02:28:32,980 --> 02:28:35,581
circumstances or that are the best for
certain environment and depends on for

7706
02:28:35,581 --> 02:28:35,591
certain environment and depends on for
 

7707
02:28:35,591 --> 02:28:37,531
certain environment and depends on for
instance the primary forms of ownership

7708
02:28:37,531 --> 02:28:37,541
instance the primary forms of ownership
 

7709
02:28:37,541 --> 02:28:39,781
instance the primary forms of ownership
and the means of production so if the

7710
02:28:39,781 --> 02:28:39,791
and the means of production so if the
 

7711
02:28:39,791 --> 02:28:42,781
and the means of production so if the
main means of production is lent then

7712
02:28:42,781 --> 02:28:42,791
main means of production is lent then
 

7713
02:28:42,791 --> 02:28:45,841
main means of production is lent then
the forms of government will be

7714
02:28:45,841 --> 02:28:45,851
the forms of government will be
 

7715
02:28:45,851 --> 02:28:47,821
the forms of government will be
regulated by the landowners and you get

7716
02:28:47,821 --> 02:28:47,831
regulated by the landowners and you get
 

7717
02:28:47,831 --> 02:28:49,980
regulated by the landowners and you get
a monarchy if you also want to have a

7718
02:28:49,980 --> 02:28:49,990
a monarchy if you also want to have a
 

7719
02:28:49,990 --> 02:28:52,890
a monarchy if you also want to have a
form of government in which a subset you

7720
02:28:52,890 --> 02:28:52,900
form of government in which a subset you
 

7721
02:28:52,900 --> 02:28:55,051
form of government in which a subset you
depend on some form of slavery for

7722
02:28:55,051 --> 02:28:55,061
depend on some form of slavery for
 

7723
02:28:55,061 --> 02:28:56,640
depend on some form of slavery for
instance where the peasants have to work

7724
02:28:56,640 --> 02:28:56,650
instance where the peasants have to work
 

7725
02:28:56,650 --> 02:28:58,861
instance where the peasants have to work
very long hours for very little gain so

7726
02:28:58,861 --> 02:28:58,871
very long hours for very little gain so
 

7727
02:28:58,871 --> 02:29:01,501
very long hours for very little gain so
very few people had enough plumbing then

7728
02:29:01,501 --> 02:29:01,511
very few people had enough plumbing then
 

7729
02:29:01,511 --> 02:29:03,781
very few people had enough plumbing then
maybe you need to promise them that we

7730
02:29:03,781 --> 02:29:03,791
maybe you need to promise them that we
 

7731
02:29:03,791 --> 02:29:06,511
maybe you need to promise them that we
had paid in in the afterlife there over

7732
02:29:06,511 --> 02:29:06,521
had paid in in the afterlife there over
 

7733
02:29:06,521 --> 02:29:08,161
had paid in in the afterlife there over
time right so you need a theocracy and

7734
02:29:08,161 --> 02:29:08,171
time right so you need a theocracy and
 

7735
02:29:08,171 --> 02:29:12,091
time right so you need a theocracy and
so for much of human history in the West

7736
02:29:12,091 --> 02:29:12,101
so for much of human history in the West
 

7737
02:29:12,101 --> 02:29:14,011
so for much of human history in the West
we had a combination of monarchy and

7738
02:29:14,011 --> 02:29:14,021
we had a combination of monarchy and
 

7739
02:29:14,021 --> 02:29:16,081
we had a combination of monarchy and
theocracy that was our form of

7740
02:29:16,081 --> 02:29:16,091
theocracy that was our form of
 

7741
02:29:16,091 --> 02:29:18,841
theocracy that was our form of
governance right at the same time the

7742
02:29:18,841 --> 02:29:18,851
governance right at the same time the
 

7743
02:29:18,851 --> 02:29:20,581
governance right at the same time the
Catholic Church implemented game

7744
02:29:20,581 --> 02:29:20,591
Catholic Church implemented game
 

7745
02:29:20,591 --> 02:29:23,701

theoretic principles I recently reread

7746
02:29:23,701 --> 02:29:23,711
theoretic principles I recently reread
 

7747
02:29:23,711 --> 02:29:25,890
theoretic principles I recently reread
Thomas or kindness it's very interesting

7748
02:29:25,890 --> 02:29:25,900
Thomas or kindness it's very interesting
 

7749
02:29:25,900 --> 02:29:27,571
Thomas or kindness it's very interesting
to see this because he was not duelist

7750
02:29:27,571 --> 02:29:27,581
to see this because he was not duelist
 

7751
02:29:27,581 --> 02:29:29,761
to see this because he was not duelist
he was translating Aristotle in a

7752
02:29:29,761 --> 02:29:29,771
he was translating Aristotle in a
 

7753
02:29:29,771 --> 02:29:32,161
he was translating Aristotle in a
particular way for the designing an

7754
02:29:32,161 --> 02:29:32,171
particular way for the designing an
 

7755
02:29:32,171 --> 02:29:34,020
particular way for the designing an
operating system for the Catholic

7756
02:29:34,020 --> 02:29:34,030
operating system for the Catholic
 

7757
02:29:34,030 --> 02:29:37,051
operating system for the Catholic
society and he says that basically

7758
02:29:37,051 --> 02:29:37,061
society and he says that basically
 

7759
02:29:37,061 --> 02:29:37,769
society and he says that basically
people

7760
02:29:37,769 --> 02:29:37,779
people
 

7761
02:29:37,779 --> 02:29:39,689
people
our animals and very much the same way

7762
02:29:39,689 --> 02:29:39,699
our animals and very much the same way
 

7763
02:29:39,699 --> 02:29:41,460
our animals and very much the same way
as Aristotle envisions which basically

7764
02:29:41,460 --> 02:29:41,470
as Aristotle envisions which basically
 

7765
02:29:41,470 --> 02:29:43,619
as Aristotle envisions which basically
organisms with cybernetic control and

7766
02:29:43,619 --> 02:29:43,629
organisms with cybernetic control and
 

7767
02:29:43,629 --> 02:29:45,539
organisms with cybernetic control and
then he says that there are additional

7768
02:29:45,539 --> 02:29:45,549
then he says that there are additional
 

7769
02:29:45,549 --> 02:29:47,519
then he says that there are additional
rational principles that humans can

7770
02:29:47,519 --> 02:29:47,529
rational principles that humans can
 

7771
02:29:47,529 --> 02:29:49,590
rational principles that humans can
discover and everybody can discover them

7772
02:29:49,590 --> 02:29:49,600
discover and everybody can discover them
 

7773
02:29:49,600 --> 02:29:51,389
discover and everybody can discover them
so they are universal if you are saying

7774
02:29:51,389 --> 02:29:51,399
so they are universal if you are saying
 

7775
02:29:51,399 --> 02:29:53,309
so they are universal if you are saying
you should understand you should submit

7776
02:29:53,309 --> 02:29:53,319
you should understand you should submit
 

7777
02:29:53,319 --> 02:29:54,989
you should understand you should submit
to them because you can rationally

7778
02:29:54,989 --> 02:29:54,999
to them because you can rationally
 

7779
02:29:54,999 --> 02:29:56,969
to them because you can rationally
deduce them and these principles are

7780
02:29:56,969 --> 02:29:56,979
deduce them and these principles are
 

7781
02:29:56,979 --> 02:30:00,619
deduce them and these principles are
roughly you should be willing to

7782
02:30:00,619 --> 02:30:00,629
roughly you should be willing to
 

7783
02:30:00,629 --> 02:30:04,199
roughly you should be willing to
self-regulate correctly you should be

7784
02:30:04,199 --> 02:30:04,209
self-regulate correctly you should be
 

7785
02:30:04,209 --> 02:30:06,090
self-regulate correctly you should be
willing to do correct social regulation

7786
02:30:06,090 --> 02:30:06,100
willing to do correct social regulation
 

7787
02:30:06,100 --> 02:30:10,649
willing to do correct social regulation
it's intro organismic you should be

7788
02:30:10,649 --> 02:30:10,659
it's intro organismic you should be
 

7789
02:30:10,659 --> 02:30:12,689
it's intro organismic you should be
willing to act on your models so we have

7790
02:30:12,689 --> 02:30:12,699
willing to act on your models so we have
 

7791
02:30:12,699 --> 02:30:17,789
willing to act on your models so we have
skin in the game and you should have

7792
02:30:17,789 --> 02:30:17,799
skin in the game and you should have
 

7793
02:30:17,799 --> 02:30:19,159
skin in the game and you should have
called rationality you should be

7794
02:30:19,159 --> 02:30:19,169
called rationality you should be
 

7795
02:30:19,169 --> 02:30:21,899
called rationality you should be
choosing the right to calls to work on

7796
02:30:21,899 --> 02:30:21,909
choosing the right to calls to work on
 

7797
02:30:21,909 --> 02:30:24,719
choosing the right to calls to work on
and so basically these three rational

7798
02:30:24,719 --> 02:30:24,729
and so basically these three rational
 

7799
02:30:24,729 --> 02:30:26,340
and so basically these three rational
principles call rationality he calls

7800
02:30:26,340 --> 02:30:26,350
principles call rationality he calls
 

7801
02:30:26,350 --> 02:30:29,250
principles call rationality he calls
prudence or wisdom the social regulation

7802
02:30:29,250 --> 02:30:29,260
prudence or wisdom the social regulation
 

7803
02:30:29,260 --> 02:30:32,039
prudence or wisdom the social regulation
is justice the correct social one and

7804
02:30:32,039 --> 02:30:32,049
is justice the correct social one and
 

7805
02:30:32,049 --> 02:30:33,840
is justice the correct social one and
the internal regulation is temperance

7806
02:30:33,840 --> 02:30:33,850
the internal regulation is temperance
 

7807
02:30:33,850 --> 02:30:37,109
the internal regulation is temperance
and this thing to be willingness to act

7808
02:30:37,109 --> 02:30:37,119
and this thing to be willingness to act
 

7809
02:30:37,119 --> 02:30:40,079
and this thing to be willingness to act
on your models is courage and then he

7810
02:30:40,079 --> 02:30:40,089
on your models is courage and then he
 

7811
02:30:40,089 --> 02:30:41,519
on your models is courage and then he
says that they are additionally to these

7812
02:30:41,519 --> 02:30:41,529
says that they are additionally to these
 

7813
02:30:41,529 --> 02:30:44,250
says that they are additionally to these
four cardinal virtues three divine

7814
02:30:44,250 --> 02:30:44,260
four cardinal virtues three divine
 

7815
02:30:44,260 --> 02:30:46,079
four cardinal virtues three divine
virtues and these three divine virtues

7816
02:30:46,079 --> 02:30:46,089
virtues and these three divine virtues
 

7817
02:30:46,089 --> 02:30:48,210
virtues and these three divine virtues
cannot be resonated used but they reveal

7818
02:30:48,210 --> 02:30:48,220
cannot be resonated used but they reveal
 

7819
02:30:48,220 --> 02:30:50,069
cannot be resonated used but they reveal
themselves by the harmony which means if

7820
02:30:50,069 --> 02:30:50,079
themselves by the harmony which means if
 

7821
02:30:50,079 --> 02:30:51,779
themselves by the harmony which means if
you assume them and you extrapolate

7822
02:30:51,779 --> 02:30:51,789
you assume them and you extrapolate
 

7823
02:30:51,789 --> 02:30:53,729
you assume them and you extrapolate
what's going to happen you will see that

7824
02:30:53,729 --> 02:30:53,739
what's going to happen you will see that
 

7825
02:30:53,739 --> 02:30:56,250
what's going to happen you will see that
that makes sense and it's often been

7826
02:30:56,250 --> 02:30:56,260
that makes sense and it's often been
 

7827
02:30:56,260 --> 02:30:58,679
that makes sense and it's often been
misunderstood as God has to tell you

7828
02:30:58,679 --> 02:30:58,689
misunderstood as God has to tell you
 

7829
02:30:58,689 --> 02:30:59,969
misunderstood as God has to tell you
that these are the things so they're a

see there's something nefarious going on

7832
02:31:01,619 --> 02:31:01,629
see there's something nefarious going on
 

7833
02:31:01,629 --> 02:31:04,889
see there's something nefarious going on
with the christian conspiracy forces you

7834
02:31:04,889 --> 02:31:04,899
with the christian conspiracy forces you
 

7835
02:31:04,899 --> 02:31:06,539
with the christian conspiracy forces you
to believe some guy with a long beard

7836
02:31:06,539 --> 02:31:06,549
to believe some guy with a long beard
 

7837
02:31:06,549 --> 02:31:10,109
to believe some guy with a long beard
that they discovered this but so these

7838
02:31:10,109 --> 02:31:10,119
that they discovered this but so these
 

7839
02:31:10,119 --> 02:31:12,149
that they discovered this but so these
principles are relatively simple again

7840
02:31:12,149 --> 02:31:12,159
principles are relatively simple again
 

7841
02:31:12,159 --> 02:31:13,979
principles are relatively simple again
you need it's for high level

7842
02:31:13,979 --> 02:31:13,989
you need it's for high level
 

7843
02:31:13,989 --> 02:31:15,359
you need it's for high level
organization for the resulting

organization for the resulting
 

7845
02:31:15,369 --> 02:31:17,969
organization for the resulting
civilization that you form commitment to

7846
02:31:17,969 --> 02:31:17,979
civilization that you form commitment to
 

7847
02:31:17,979 --> 02:31:20,550
civilization that you form commitment to
unity so basically you serve this higher

7848
02:31:20,550 --> 02:31:20,560
unity so basically you serve this higher
 

7849
02:31:20,560 --> 02:31:23,429
unity so basically you serve this higher
larger thing this structural principle

7850
02:31:23,429 --> 02:31:23,439
larger thing this structural principle
 

7851
02:31:23,439 --> 02:31:25,109
larger thing this structural principle
on the next level and he calls that

7852
02:31:25,109 --> 02:31:25,119
on the next level and he calls that
 

7853
02:31:25,119 --> 02:31:28,409
on the next level and he calls that
phase then there needs to be a

7854
02:31:28,409 --> 02:31:28,419
phase then there needs to be a
 

7855
02:31:28,419 --> 02:31:30,090
phase then there needs to be a
commitment to shared purpose this is

7856
02:31:30,090 --> 02:31:30,100
commitment to shared purpose this is
 

7857
02:31:30,100 --> 02:31:31,469
commitment to shared purpose this is
basically this global reward that you

7858
02:31:31,469 --> 02:31:31,479
basically this global reward that you
 

7859
02:31:31,479 --> 02:31:32,939
basically this global reward that you
try to figure out what that should be

7860
02:31:32,939 --> 02:31:32,949
try to figure out what that should be
 

7861
02:31:32,949 --> 02:31:34,380
try to figure out what that should be
and now you can facilitate this and this

7862
02:31:34,380 --> 02:31:34,390
and now you can facilitate this and this
 

7863
02:31:34,390 --> 02:31:36,269
and now you can facilitate this and this
is love the commitment to shared purpose

7864
02:31:36,269 --> 02:31:36,279
is love the commitment to shared purpose
 

7865
02:31:36,279 --> 02:31:38,880
is love the commitment to shared purpose
is the core of love right you see the

7866
02:31:38,880 --> 02:31:38,890
is the core of love right you see the
 

7867
02:31:38,890 --> 02:31:40,590
is the core of love right you see the
sacred thing that is more important than

7868
02:31:40,590 --> 02:31:40,600
sacred thing that is more important than
 

7869
02:31:40,600 --> 02:31:42,989
sacred thing that is more important than
your own organism ayk interests in the

7870
02:31:42,989 --> 02:31:42,999
your own organism ayk interests in the
 

7871
02:31:42,999 --> 02:31:44,579
your own organism ayk interests in the
other and you serve this together and

7872
02:31:44,579 --> 02:31:44,589
other and you serve this together and
 

7873
02:31:44,589 --> 02:31:46,019
other and you serve this together and
this is how you see the sacred and the

7874
02:31:46,019 --> 02:31:46,029
this is how you see the sacred and the
 

7875
02:31:46,029 --> 02:31:49,019
this is how you see the sacred and the
other and the last one is hope which

7876
02:31:49,019 --> 02:31:49,029
other and the last one is hope which
 

7877
02:31:49,029 --> 02:31:50,609
other and the last one is hope which
means you need to be willing to act on

7878
02:31:50,609 --> 02:31:50,619
means you need to be willing to act on
 

7879
02:31:50,619 --> 02:31:51,479
means you need to be willing to act on
that prayer

7880
02:31:51,479 --> 02:31:51,489
that prayer
 

7881
02:31:51,489 --> 02:31:53,400
that prayer
principle without getting rewards in the

7882
02:31:53,400 --> 02:31:53,410
principle without getting rewards in the
 

7883
02:31:53,410 --> 02:31:55,019
principle without getting rewards in the
here and now because it doesn't exist

7884
02:31:55,019 --> 02:31:55,029
here and now because it doesn't exist
 

7885
02:31:55,029 --> 02:31:57,059
here and now because it doesn't exist
yet then you start out building the

7886
02:31:57,059 --> 02:31:57,069
yet then you start out building the
 

7887
02:31:57,069 --> 02:31:58,559
yet then you start out building the
civilization right so you need to be

7888
02:31:58,559 --> 02:31:58,569
civilization right so you need to be
 

7889
02:31:58,569 --> 02:32:01,620
civilization right so you need to be
able to do this in the absence of its

7890
02:32:01,620 --> 02:32:01,630
able to do this in the absence of its
 

7891
02:32:01,630 --> 02:32:04,530
able to do this in the absence of its
actual existence yet so it can come into

7892
02:32:04,530 --> 02:32:04,540
actual existence yet so it can come into
 

7893
02:32:04,540 --> 02:32:06,420
actual existence yet so it can come into
being so yes so the way it comes into

7894
02:32:06,420 --> 02:32:06,430
being so yes so the way it comes into
 

7895
02:32:06,430 --> 02:32:08,160
being so yes so the way it comes into
being is by you accepting those notions

7896
02:32:08,160 --> 02:32:08,170
being is by you accepting those notions
 

7897
02:32:08,170 --> 02:32:11,280
being is by you accepting those notions
and then you see there these these three

7898
02:32:11,280 --> 02:32:11,290
and then you see there these these three
 

7899
02:32:11,290 --> 02:32:12,960
and then you see there these these three
divine concepts then you see them and

7900
02:32:12,960 --> 02:32:12,970
divine concepts then you see them and
 

7901
02:32:12,970 --> 02:32:15,059
divine concepts then you see them and
realized now the most divine is the

7902
02:32:15,059 --> 02:32:15,069
realized now the most divine is the
 

7903
02:32:15,069 --> 02:32:16,710
realized now the most divine is the
loaded concept and olive oil and ice

7904
02:32:16,710 --> 02:32:16,720
loaded concept and olive oil and ice
 

7905
02:32:16,720 --> 02:32:18,660
loaded concept and olive oil and ice
because we are outside of this cart and

7906
02:32:18,660 --> 02:32:18,670
because we are outside of this cart and
 

7907
02:32:18,670 --> 02:32:20,130
because we are outside of this cart and
we are still scarred from breaking free

7908
02:32:20,130 --> 02:32:20,140
we are still scarred from breaking free
 

7909
02:32:20,140 --> 02:32:22,620
we are still scarred from breaking free
of it but the idea is basically we need

7910
02:32:22,620 --> 02:32:22,630
of it but the idea is basically we need
 

7911
02:32:22,630 --> 02:32:24,300
of it but the idea is basically we need
to have a civilization that acts as an

7912
02:32:24,300 --> 02:32:24,310
to have a civilization that acts as an
 

7913
02:32:24,310 --> 02:32:26,370
to have a civilization that acts as an
intentional agent like an insect State

7914
02:32:26,370 --> 02:32:26,380
intentional agent like an insect State
 

7915
02:32:26,380 --> 02:32:29,040
intentional agent like an insect State
and we are not actually a tribal species

7916
02:32:29,040 --> 02:32:29,050
and we are not actually a tribal species
 

7917
02:32:29,050 --> 02:32:31,320
and we are not actually a tribal species
we are state building species and was

7918
02:32:31,320 --> 02:32:31,330
we are state building species and was
 

7919
02:32:31,330 --> 02:32:34,349
we are state building species and was
what enabled State Building is basic the

7920
02:32:34,349 --> 02:32:34,359
what enabled State Building is basic the
 

7921
02:32:34,359 --> 02:32:36,929
what enabled State Building is basic the
formation of religious states and other

7922
02:32:36,929 --> 02:32:36,939
formation of religious states and other
 

7923
02:32:36,939 --> 02:32:38,910
formation of religious states and other
forms of rule-based administration in

7924
02:32:38,910 --> 02:32:38,920
forms of rule-based administration in
 

7925
02:32:38,920 --> 02:32:40,740
forms of rule-based administration in
which the individual doesn't matter as

7926
02:32:40,740 --> 02:32:40,750
which the individual doesn't matter as
 

7927
02:32:40,750 --> 02:32:42,630
which the individual doesn't matter as
much as the rule or the higher goal

7928
02:32:42,630 --> 02:32:42,640
much as the rule or the higher goal
 

7929
02:32:42,640 --> 02:32:44,969
much as the rule or the higher goal
right we got there by the question

7930
02:32:44,969 --> 02:32:44,979
right we got there by the question
 

7931
02:32:44,979 --> 02:32:46,679
right we got there by the question
what's the optimal form of governance so

7932
02:32:46,679 --> 02:32:46,689
what's the optimal form of governance so
 

7933
02:32:46,689 --> 02:32:48,570
what's the optimal form of governance so
I don't think that chaos or Catholicism

7934
02:32:48,570 --> 02:32:48,580
I don't think that chaos or Catholicism
 

7935
02:32:48,580 --> 02:32:50,010
I don't think that chaos or Catholicism
is the optimal form of governance

7936
02:32:50,010 --> 02:32:50,020
is the optimal form of governance
 

7937
02:32:50,020 --> 02:32:51,330
is the optimal form of governance
because it's obviously on the way out

7938
02:32:51,330 --> 02:32:51,340
because it's obviously on the way out
 

7939
02:32:51,340 --> 02:32:53,580
because it's obviously on the way out
right so it is for the present type of

7940
02:32:53,580 --> 02:32:53,590
right so it is for the present type of
 

7941
02:32:53,590 --> 02:32:56,660
right so it is for the present type of
society that we are in religious

7942
02:32:56,660 --> 02:32:56,670
society that we are in religious
 

7943
02:32:56,670 --> 02:32:58,860
society that we are in religious
institutions don't seem to be optimal to

7944
02:32:58,860 --> 02:32:58,870
institutions don't seem to be optimal to
 

7945
02:32:58,870 --> 02:33:00,570
institutions don't seem to be optimal to
organize that so what we discovered

7946
02:33:00,570 --> 02:33:00,580
organize that so what we discovered
 

7947
02:33:00,580 --> 02:33:02,969
organize that so what we discovered
right now that we live in in the West is

7948
02:33:02,969 --> 02:33:02,979
right now that we live in in the West is
 

7949
02:33:02,979 --> 02:33:05,760
right now that we live in in the West is
democracy and democracy is the rule of

7950
02:33:05,760 --> 02:33:05,770
democracy and democracy is the rule of
 

7951
02:33:05,770 --> 02:33:06,990
democracy and democracy is the rule of
oligarchs there are the people that

7952
02:33:06,990 --> 02:33:07,000
oligarchs there are the people that
 

7953
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:08,660
oligarchs there are the people that
currently own the means of production

7954
02:33:08,660 --> 02:33:08,670
currently own the means of production
 

7955
02:33:08,670 --> 02:33:10,950
currently own the means of production
that is administered not by the

7956
02:33:10,950 --> 02:33:10,960
that is administered not by the
 

7957
02:33:10,960 --> 02:33:12,559
that is administered not by the
oligarchs themselves because they

7958
02:33:12,559 --> 02:33:12,569
oligarchs themselves because they
 

7959
02:33:12,569 --> 02:33:14,610
oligarchs themselves because they
there's too much distraction right here

7960
02:33:14,610 --> 02:33:14,620
there's too much distraction right here
 

7961
02:33:14,620 --> 02:33:17,309
there's too much distraction right here
so much innovation that we have in every

7962
02:33:17,309 --> 02:33:17,319
so much innovation that we have in every
 

7963
02:33:17,319 --> 02:33:19,290
so much innovation that we have in every
generation new means of production let

7964
02:33:19,290 --> 02:33:19,300
generation new means of production let
 

7965
02:33:19,300 --> 02:33:22,500
generation new means of production let
me invent and corporations dive usually

7966
02:33:22,500 --> 02:33:22,510
me invent and corporations dive usually
 

7967
02:33:22,510 --> 02:33:24,059
me invent and corporations dive usually
after 30 years or so and something

7968
02:33:24,059 --> 02:33:24,069
after 30 years or so and something
 

7969
02:33:24,069 --> 02:33:26,130
after 30 years or so and something
either takes the leading role in our

7970
02:33:26,130 --> 02:33:26,140
either takes the leading role in our
 

7971
02:33:26,140 --> 02:33:26,880
either takes the leading role in our
societies

7972
02:33:26,880 --> 02:33:26,890
societies
 

7973
02:33:26,890 --> 02:33:29,460
societies
so it's administered by institutions and

7974
02:33:29,460 --> 02:33:29,470
so it's administered by institutions and
 

7975
02:33:29,470 --> 02:33:30,990
so it's administered by institutions and
these institutions themselves are not

7976
02:33:30,990 --> 02:33:31,000
these institutions themselves are not
 

7977
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:33,800
these institutions themselves are not
elected but they provide continuity and

7978
02:33:33,800 --> 02:33:33,810
elected but they provide continuity and
 

7979
02:33:33,810 --> 02:33:36,870
elected but they provide continuity and
they are led by electable politicians

7980
02:33:36,870 --> 02:33:36,880
they are led by electable politicians
 

7981
02:33:36,880 --> 02:33:39,150
they are led by electable politicians
and this makes it possible that you can

7982
02:33:39,150 --> 02:33:39,160
and this makes it possible that you can
 

7983
02:33:39,160 --> 02:33:40,860
and this makes it possible that you can
adapt to change without having to kill

7984
02:33:40,860 --> 02:33:40,870
adapt to change without having to kill

go deep right we need Baker's and if you

8080
02:35:19,200 --> 02:35:19,210
go deep right we need Baker's and if you
 

8081
02:35:19,210 --> 02:35:21,030
go deep right we need Baker's and if you
are very good bakers but in a society

8082
02:35:21,030 --> 02:35:21,040
are very good bakers but in a society

that innovates maybe you can replace all

02:35:22,950 --> 02:35:22,960
that innovates maybe you can replace all

02:35:22,960 --> 02:35:24,500

the Baker's with a really good machine

the Baker's with a really good machine
 

8087
02:35:24,510 --> 02:35:27,540
the Baker's with a really good machine
right and that's not a bad thing and

8088
02:35:27,540 --> 02:35:27,550
right and that's not a bad thing and
 

8089
02:35:27,550 --> 02:35:28,770
right and that's not a bad thing and
it's a thing that made us so successful

8090
02:35:28,770 --> 02:35:28,780
it's a thing that made us so successful
 

8091
02:35:28,780 --> 02:35:31,260
it's a thing that made us so successful
right but it also means that the u.s. is

8092
02:35:31,260 --> 02:35:31,270
right but it also means that the u.s. is
 

8093
02:35:31,270 --> 02:35:33,000
right but it also means that the u.s. is
not optimizing for sustainability but

8094
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:33,010
not optimizing for sustainability but
 

8095
02:35:33,010 --> 02:35:35,790
not optimizing for sustainability but
for innovation and so it's not obvious

8096
02:35:35,790 --> 02:35:35,800
for innovation and so it's not obvious
 

8097
02:35:35,800 --> 02:35:38,520
for innovation and so it's not obvious
as the evolutionary processes unrolling

02:35:38,520 --> 02:35:38,530
as the evolutionary processes unrolling
 

8099
02:35:38,530 --> 02:35:40,350
as the evolutionary processes unrolling
is not obvious that that long term would

8100
02:35:40,350 --> 02:35:40,360
is not obvious that that long term would
 

8101
02:35:40,360 --> 02:35:43,380
is not obvious that that long term would
be better it's it has side effect so you

8102
02:35:43,380 --> 02:35:43,390
be better it's it has side effect so you
 

8103
02:35:43,390 --> 02:35:45,900
be better it's it has side effect so you
basically if you cheat you will have a

02:35:45,900 --> 02:35:45,910
basically if you cheat you will have a

02:35:45,910 --> 02:35:47,850
basically if you cheat you will have a

02:35:47,850 --> 02:35:47,860
certain layer of toxic sludge that

02:35:47,860 --> 02:35:50,100
certain layer of toxic sludge that
covers everything there is a result of

02:35:50,100 --> 02:35:50,110
covers everything there is a result of
 

8109
02:35:50,110 --> 02:35:52,080
covers everything there is a result of
cheating and we have to unroll this

8110
02:35:52,080 --> 02:35:52,090
cheating and we have to unroll this
 

8111
02:35:52,090 --> 02:35:53,670
cheating and we have to unroll this
evolutionary process to figure out if

these side effects are so damaging that

these side effects are so damaging that
 

8115
02:35:55,870 --> 02:35:57,840
these side effects are so damaging that
the system is horrible or if the

02:36:01,180 --> 02:36:04,440

02:36:04,440 --> 02:36:04,450
negative effects how do we get to the
 

8121
02:36:04,450 --> 02:36:05,990

that was from I'm trying to trace back

8125
02:36:09,189 --> 02:36:12,480
that was from I'm trying to trace back
like five minutes I suspect that we can

02:36:12,480 --> 02:36:12,490
like five minutes I suspect that we can

02:36:12,490 --> 02:36:14,820
like five minutes I suspect that we can
find a way back to AI by thinking about

02:36:14,820 --> 02:36:14,830
find a way back to AI by thinking about
 

8129
02:36:14,830 --> 02:36:16,710
find a way back to AI by thinking about
the way in which our brain has to

02:36:16,710 --> 02:36:16,720
the way in which our brain has to
 

8131
02:36:16,720 --> 02:36:17,680
the way in which our brain has to
organize it

8132
02:36:17,680 --> 02:36:17,690
organize it
 

8133
02:36:17,690 --> 02:36:20,160
organize it
right in some sense our brain is a

8134
02:36:20,160 --> 02:36:20,170
right in some sense our brain is a
 

8135
02:36:20,170 --> 02:36:23,551
right in some sense our brain is a
society of neurons and our mind is a

02:36:23,551 --> 02:36:23,561
society of neurons and our mind is a
 

8137
02:36:23,561 --> 02:36:26,860
society of neurons and our mind is a
society of behaviors and they need to be

8138
02:36:26,860 --> 02:36:26,870
society of behaviors and they need to be
 

8139
02:36:26,870 --> 02:36:29,140

that implements regulation and

02:36:31,570 --> 02:36:31,580
that implements regulation and
 

8143
02:36:31,580 --> 02:36:34,780
that implements regulation and
government is social regulation we often

8144
02:36:34,780 --> 02:36:34,790
government is social regulation we often
 

8145
02:36:34,790 --> 02:36:36,520
government is social regulation we often
see government is the manifestation of

8146
02:36:36,520 --> 02:36:36,530
see government is the manifestation of
 

8147
02:36:36,530 --> 02:36:38,051
see government is the manifestation of
power or local interests but it's

8148
02:36:38,051 --> 02:36:38,061
power or local interests but it's
 

8149
02:36:38,061 --> 02:36:40,240
power or local interests but it's
actually a platform for negotiating the

02:36:40,240 --> 02:36:40,250
actually a platform for negotiating the
 

8151
02:36:40,250 --> 02:36:42,970
actually a platform for negotiating the
conditions of human survival and this

8152
02:36:42,970 --> 02:36:42,980
conditions of human survival and this
 

8153
02:36:42,980 --> 02:36:45,160

02:38:44,211 --> 02:38:45,881
your purposes the needs don't form a
hierarchy they just coexist and compete

and your organism is why brain has to

8268
02:38:48,401 --> 02:38:48,411
and your organism is why brain has to
 

8269
02:38:48,411 --> 02:38:50,321
and your organism is why brain has to
find it on dynamic homeostasis between

8270
02:38:50,321 --> 02:38:50,331
find it on dynamic homeostasis between
 

8271
02:38:50,331 --> 02:38:52,571
find it on dynamic homeostasis between
them but the purposes need to be

02:38:52,571 --> 02:38:52,581
them but the purposes need to be
 

8273
02:38:52,581 --> 02:38:54,671
them but the purposes need to be
consistent so you basically can create a

8274
02:38:54,671 --> 02:38:54,681
consistent so you basically can create a
 

8275
02:38:54,681 --> 02:38:56,970
consistent so you basically can create a
story for your life and make plans and

8276
02:38:56,970 --> 02:38:56,980
story for your life and make plans and
 

8277
02:38:56,980 --> 02:38:59,921
story for your life and make plans and
so we organize them all into hierarchies

8278
02:38:59,921 --> 02:38:59,931
so we organize them all into hierarchies
 

8279
02:38:59,931 --> 02:39:01,661
so we organize them all into hierarchies
and there is not a unique solution for

and there is not a unique solution for

02:39:01,671 --> 02:39:03,161
and there is not a unique solution for
this and people eat to make art and

02:39:03,171 --> 02:39:05,470
this and people eat to make art and
other people regard to eat and they

other people regard to eat and they

02:39:05,480 --> 02:39:07,091
other people regard to eat and they

but they cooperate in very different
 

8289
02:39:08,661 --> 02:39:11,411
but they cooperate in very different
ways because they automate codes are

02:39:11,411 --> 02:39:11,421
ways because they automate codes are
 

8291
02:39:11,421 --> 02:39:13,600
ways because they automate codes are
different and vie cooperate based on

02:39:16,810 --> 02:39:16,820
cooperation on shared purpose is

between the experience of emotion and
 

8305
02:39:29,331 --> 02:39:31,930
between the experience of emotion and

the expression of emotion of course so
 

8307
02:39:31,940 --> 02:39:34,511
the expression of emotion of course so
the experience of emotion is a feeling

the experience of emotion is a feeling
 

8309
02:39:34,521 --> 02:39:37,751
the experience of emotion is a feeling
and in the sense what you feel is an

appraisal that your perceptual system is

features into a space so what you will
 

8335
02:40:05,931 --> 02:40:08,621

feel about your emotion is a projection

8336
02:40:08,621 --> 02:40:08,631
feel about your emotion is a projection
 

8337
02:40:08,631 --> 02:40:10,390
feel about your emotion is a projection
usually enjoy your body map you might

8338
02:40:10,390 --> 02:40:10,400
usually enjoy your body map you might
 

8339
02:40:10,400 --> 02:40:12,281
usually enjoy your body map you might
feel anxiety in your solar plexus and

8340
02:40:12,281 --> 02:40:12,291
feel anxiety in your solar plexus and
 

8341
02:40:12,291 --> 02:40:14,470
feel anxiety in your solar plexus and
you might feel it as a contraction which

8342
02:40:14,470 --> 02:40:14,480
you might feel it as a contraction which
 

8343
02:40:14,480 --> 02:40:17,411
you might feel it as a contraction which
is all geometry right your body map is

8344
02:40:17,411 --> 02:40:17,421
is all geometry right your body map is
 

8345
02:40:17,421 --> 02:40:19,091
is all geometry right your body map is
the space that is always instantiate and

8346
02:40:19,091 --> 02:40:19,101
the space that is always instantiate and
 

8347
02:40:19,101 --> 02:40:21,701
the space that is always instantiate and
always available so it's a very obvious

8348
02:40:21,701 --> 02:40:21,711
always available so it's a very obvious
 

8349
02:40:21,711 --> 02:40:26,801
always available so it's a very obvious
cheat if your non-symbolic parts of your

8350
02:40:26,801 --> 02:40:26,811
cheat if your non-symbolic parts of your
 

8351
02:40:26,811 --> 02:40:28,541
cheat if your non-symbolic parts of your
brain try to talk to your symbolic parts

8352
02:40:28,541 --> 02:40:28,551
brain try to talk to your symbolic parts
 

8353
02:40:28,551 --> 02:40:30,161
brain try to talk to your symbolic parts
of your brain to map the feelings into

8354
02:40:30,161 --> 02:40:30,171
of your brain to map the feelings into
 

8355
02:40:30,171 --> 02:40:32,201
of your brain to map the feelings into
the body map and then you perceive them

8356
02:40:32,201 --> 02:40:32,211
the body map and then you perceive them
 

8357
02:40:32,211 --> 02:40:34,270
the body map and then you perceive them
as pleasant and unpleasant depending on

8358
02:40:34,270 --> 02:40:34,280
as pleasant and unpleasant depending on
 

8359
02:40:34,280 --> 02:40:36,011
as pleasant and unpleasant depending on
whether the appraisal has a negative or

8360
02:40:36,011 --> 02:40:36,021
whether the appraisal has a negative or
 

8361
02:40:36,021 --> 02:40:38,081
whether the appraisal has a negative or
positive valence and then you have

8362
02:40:38,081 --> 02:40:38,091
positive valence and then you have
 

8363
02:40:38,091 --> 02:40:40,121
positive valence and then you have
different features of them that give you

8364
02:40:40,121 --> 02:40:40,131
different features of them that give you
 

8365
02:40:40,131 --> 02:40:42,371
different features of them that give you
more knowledge about the nature of what

8366
02:40:42,371 --> 02:40:42,381
more knowledge about the nature of what
 

8367
02:40:42,381 --> 02:40:43,631
more knowledge about the nature of what
you're feeling so for instance when you

8368
02:40:43,631 --> 02:40:43,641
you're feeling so for instance when you
 

8369
02:40:43,641 --> 02:40:44,240
you're feeling so for instance when you
feel

8370
02:40:44,240 --> 02:40:44,250
feel
 

8371
02:40:44,250 --> 02:40:45,770
feel
connected to other people you typically

8372
02:40:45,770 --> 02:40:45,780
connected to other people you typically
 

8373
02:40:45,780 --> 02:40:47,480
connected to other people you typically
feel this new chest region around your

8374
02:40:47,480 --> 02:40:47,490
feel this new chest region around your
 

8375
02:40:47,490 --> 02:40:49,730
feel this new chest region around your
heart and you feel this is an expansive

8376
02:40:49,730 --> 02:40:49,740
heart and you feel this is an expansive
 

8377
02:40:49,740 --> 02:40:51,710
heart and you feel this is an expansive
feeling in which you're reaching out

8378
02:40:51,710 --> 02:40:51,720
feeling in which you're reaching out
 

8379
02:40:51,720 --> 02:40:54,470
feeling in which you're reaching out
right and it's very intuitive to encode

8380
02:40:54,470 --> 02:40:54,480
right and it's very intuitive to encode
 

8381
02:40:54,480 --> 02:40:56,690
right and it's very intuitive to encode
it like this that's why it's encoded

8382
02:40:56,690 --> 02:40:56,700
it like this that's why it's encoded
 

8383
02:40:56,700 --> 02:40:59,120
it like this that's why it's encoded
like it's incredible it's in code it's a

8384
02:40:59,120 --> 02:40:59,130
like it's incredible it's in code it's a
 

8385
02:40:59,130 --> 02:41:00,890
like it's incredible it's in code it's a
code in which the non symbolic parts of

8386
02:41:00,890 --> 02:41:00,900
code in which the non symbolic parts of
 

8387
02:41:00,900 --> 02:41:01,490
code in which the non symbolic parts of
your mind

8388
02:41:01,490 --> 02:41:01,500
your mind
 

8389
02:41:01,500 --> 02:41:03,080
your mind
talk to the symbolic ones and then the

8390
02:41:03,080 --> 02:41:03,090
talk to the symbolic ones and then the
 

8391
02:41:03,090 --> 02:41:05,390
talk to the symbolic ones and then the
expression of emotion is then the final

8392
02:41:05,390 --> 02:41:05,400
expression of emotion is then the final
 

8393
02:41:05,400 --> 02:41:07,790
expression of emotion is then the final
step that could be sort of gestural or

8394
02:41:07,790 --> 02:41:07,800
step that could be sort of gestural or
 

8395
02:41:07,800 --> 02:41:09,920
step that could be sort of gestural or
visual yeah so on that's part of this

8396
02:41:09,920 --> 02:41:09,930
visual yeah so on that's part of this
 

8397
02:41:09,930 --> 02:41:11,960
visual yeah so on that's part of this
MOOC is probably evolved as part of an

8398
02:41:11,960 --> 02:41:11,970
MOOC is probably evolved as part of an
 

8399
02:41:11,970 --> 02:41:14,600
MOOC is probably evolved as part of an
adversarial communication so as soon as

8400
02:41:14,600 --> 02:41:14,610
adversarial communication so as soon as
 

8401
02:41:14,610 --> 02:41:16,940
adversarial communication so as soon as
you started to observe the facial

8402
02:41:16,940 --> 02:41:16,950
you started to observe the facial
 

8403
02:41:16,950 --> 02:41:18,530
you started to observe the facial
expression and poster of others to

8404
02:41:18,530 --> 02:41:18,540
expression and poster of others to
 

8405
02:41:18,540 --> 02:41:19,880
expression and poster of others to
understand what emotional state they're

8406
02:41:19,880 --> 02:41:19,890
understand what emotional state they're
 

8407
02:41:19,890 --> 02:41:20,210
understand what emotional state they're
in

8408
02:41:20,210 --> 02:41:20,220
in
 

8409
02:41:20,220 --> 02:41:22,190
in
others started to use this as signalling

8410
02:41:22,190 --> 02:41:22,200
others started to use this as signalling
 

8411
02:41:22,200 --> 02:41:23,990
others started to use this as signalling
and also to subvert your model of the

8412
02:41:23,990 --> 02:41:24,000
and also to subvert your model of the
 

8413
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:26,780
and also to subvert your model of the
emotional state so we now look at the

8414
02:41:26,780 --> 02:41:26,790
emotional state so we now look at the
 

8415
02:41:26,790 --> 02:41:28,340
emotional state so we now look at the
inflections at the difference between

8416
02:41:28,340 --> 02:41:28,350
inflections at the difference between
 

8417
02:41:28,350 --> 02:41:29,870
inflections at the difference between
the standard face that they're going to

8418
02:41:29,870 --> 02:41:29,880
the standard face that they're going to
 

8419
02:41:29,880 --> 02:41:31,700
the standard face that they're going to
make in this situation right when you

8420
02:41:31,700 --> 02:41:31,710
make in this situation right when you
 

8421
02:41:31,710 --> 02:41:33,200
make in this situation right when you
were at the funeral everybody expects

8422
02:41:33,200 --> 02:41:33,210
were at the funeral everybody expects
 

8423
02:41:33,210 --> 02:41:35,300
were at the funeral everybody expects
you to make a solemn face but the solemn

8424
02:41:35,300 --> 02:41:35,310
you to make a solemn face but the solemn
 

8425
02:41:35,310 --> 02:41:36,800
you to make a solemn face but the solemn
face doesn't express whether you're said

8426
02:41:36,800 --> 02:41:36,810
face doesn't express whether you're said
 

8427
02:41:36,810 --> 02:41:38,360
face doesn't express whether you're said
or not it just expresses that you

8428
02:41:38,360 --> 02:41:38,370
or not it just expresses that you
 

8429
02:41:38,370 --> 02:41:39,830
or not it just expresses that you
understand what face you have to make it

8430
02:41:39,830 --> 02:41:39,840
understand what face you have to make it
 

8431
02:41:39,840 --> 02:41:42,320
understand what face you have to make it
a funeral nobody should know that you

8432
02:41:42,320 --> 02:41:42,330
a funeral nobody should know that you
 

8433
02:41:42,330 --> 02:41:44,930
a funeral nobody should know that you
are Trump triumphant so when you try to

8434
02:41:44,930 --> 02:41:44,940
are Trump triumphant so when you try to
 

8435
02:41:44,940 --> 02:41:46,490
are Trump triumphant so when you try to
read the emotion of another person you

8436
02:41:46,490 --> 02:41:46,500
read the emotion of another person you
 

8437
02:41:46,500 --> 02:41:49,730
read the emotion of another person you
try to look at the Delta between said

8438
02:41:49,730 --> 02:41:49,740
try to look at the Delta between said
 

8439
02:41:49,740 --> 02:41:52,760
try to look at the Delta between said
truly said expression and the things

8440
02:41:52,760 --> 02:41:52,770
truly said expression and the things
 

8441
02:41:52,770 --> 02:41:54,740
truly said expression and the things
that are animated mating this face

8442
02:41:54,740 --> 02:41:54,750
that are animated mating this face
 

8443
02:41:54,750 --> 02:41:57,410
that are animated mating this face
behind the curtain so the interesting

8444
02:41:57,410 --> 02:41:57,420
behind the curtain so the interesting
 

8445
02:41:57,420 --> 02:42:00,470
behind the curtain so the interesting
thing is so having done these having

8446
02:42:00,470 --> 02:42:00,480
thing is so having done these having
 

8447
02:42:00,480 --> 02:42:02,870
thing is so having done these having
them as podcast and the video component

8448
02:42:02,870 --> 02:42:02,880
them as podcast and the video component
 

8449
02:42:02,880 --> 02:42:05,300
them as podcast and the video component
one of the things I've learned is that

8450
02:42:05,300 --> 02:42:05,310
one of the things I've learned is that
 

8451
02:42:05,310 --> 02:42:08,750
one of the things I've learned is that
now I'm Russian and I don't know how to

8452
02:42:08,750 --> 02:42:08,760
now I'm Russian and I don't know how to
 

8453
02:42:08,760 --> 02:42:11,360
now I'm Russian and I don't know how to
express emotion on my face when I see

8454
02:42:11,360 --> 02:42:11,370
express emotion on my face when I see
 

8455
02:42:11,370 --> 02:42:14,360
express emotion on my face when I see
that as weakness but whatever the people

8456
02:42:14,360 --> 02:42:14,370
that as weakness but whatever the people
 

8457
02:42:14,370 --> 02:42:17,210
that as weakness but whatever the people
look to me after you say something they

8458
02:42:17,210 --> 02:42:17,220
look to me after you say something they
 

8459
02:42:17,220 --> 02:42:21,020
look to me after you say something they
look to my face - just to help them see

8460
02:42:21,020 --> 02:42:21,030
look to my face - just to help them see
 

8461
02:42:21,030 --> 02:42:23,330
look to my face - just to help them see
how they should feel about we said which

8462
02:42:23,330 --> 02:42:23,340
how they should feel about we said which
 

8463
02:42:23,340 --> 02:42:24,650
how they should feel about we said which
is fascinating because then they'll

8464
02:42:24,650 --> 02:42:24,660
is fascinating because then they'll
 

8465
02:42:24,660 --> 02:42:27,140
is fascinating because then they'll
often comment on why did you look bored

8466
02:42:27,140 --> 02:42:27,150
often comment on why did you look bored
 

8467
02:42:27,150 --> 02:42:29,060
often comment on why did you look bored
or why did you particularly enjoy that

8468
02:42:29,060 --> 02:42:29,070
or why did you particularly enjoy that
 

8469
02:42:29,070 --> 02:42:31,310
or why did you particularly enjoy that
part or why did you whatever it's a kind

8559
02:44:27,600 --> 02:44:29,750
it's kind of true no yeah there's a
deeper aspect to this it's also how we

8560
02:44:29,750 --> 02:44:29,760
deeper aspect to this it's also how we
 

8561
02:44:29,760 --> 02:44:32,840
deeper aspect to this it's also how we
construct meaning in the u.s. usually

8562
02:44:32,840 --> 02:44:32,850
construct meaning in the u.s. usually
 

8563
02:44:32,850 --> 02:44:34,730
construct meaning in the u.s. usually
you focus on the positive aspects and

8564
02:44:34,730 --> 02:44:34,740
you focus on the positive aspects and
 

8565
02:44:34,740 --> 02:44:37,460
you focus on the positive aspects and
you just suppress the negative aspects

8566
02:44:37,460 --> 02:44:37,470
you just suppress the negative aspects
 

8567
02:44:37,470 --> 02:44:40,970
you just suppress the negative aspects
and and our Eastern European traditions

8568
02:44:40,970 --> 02:44:40,980
and and our Eastern European traditions
 

8569
02:44:40,980 --> 02:44:44,480
and and our Eastern European traditions
we emphasize the fact that if you hold

8570
02:44:44,480 --> 02:44:44,490
we emphasize the fact that if you hold
 

8571
02:44:44,490 --> 02:44:46,550
we emphasize the fact that if you hold
something above the waterline you also

8572
02:44:46,550 --> 02:44:46,560
something above the waterline you also
 

8573
02:44:46,560 --> 02:44:47,930
something above the waterline you also
need to put something below the

8574
02:44:47,930 --> 02:44:47,940
need to put something below the
 

8575
02:44:47,940 --> 02:44:49,670
need to put something below the
waterline because existence by itself is

8576
02:44:49,670 --> 02:44:49,680
waterline because existence by itself is
 

8577
02:44:49,680 --> 02:44:52,910
waterline because existence by itself is
as best neutral right that's the basic

02:44:52,910 --> 02:44:52,920
as best neutral right that's the basic
 

8579
02:44:52,920 --> 02:44:55,460
as best neutral right that's the basic
intuition if at best neutral yes or can

8580
02:44:55,460 --> 02:44:55,470
intuition if at best neutral yes or can
 

8581
02:44:55,470 --> 02:44:57,140
intuition if at best neutral yes or can

doing this is not necessarily a deeper

doing this is not necessarily a deeper
 

9025
02:53:03,140 --> 02:53:04,719
doing this is not necessarily a deeper
meaning I think the meaning that we have

9026
02:53:04,719 --> 02:53:04,729
meaning I think the meaning that we have
 

9027
02:53:04,729 --> 02:53:07,059
meaning I think the meaning that we have
priors for that we evolved for outside

9028
02:53:07,059 --> 02:53:07,069
priors for that we evolved for outside
 

9029
02:53:07,069 --> 02:53:08,349
priors for that we evolved for outside
of the priors there is no meaning

02:53:08,349 --> 02:53:08,359
of the priors there is no meaning
 

9031
02:53:08,359 --> 02:53:10,000
of the priors there is no meaning
meaning only exists if a mind protects

9032
02:53:10,000 --> 02:53:10,010
meaning only exists if a mind protects
 

9033
02:53:10,010 --> 02:53:12,880
meaning only exists if a mind protects
it right yeah there is only civilization

9034
02:53:12,880 --> 02:53:12,890
it right yeah there is only civilization

02:53:12,890 --> 02:53:15,609
it right yeah there is only civilization

to me is to try to build and maintain
the sustainable civilization and taking

9043
02:53:23,629 --> 02:53:28,979
a sliced Abad outside of that we talked
about a man with a beard and God but

about a man with a beard and God but
 

9045
02:53:28,989 --> 02:53:34,329

darkness and then they make out
 

9207
02:56:33,529 --> 02:56:35,290
darkness and then they make out
directions in it and they discover sky

9208
02:56:35,290 --> 02:56:35,300
directions in it and they discover sky
 

9209
02:56:35,300 --> 02:56:37,029
directions in it and they discover sky

and the animals and they give everything
 

9213
02:56:38,239 --> 02:56:40,090

02:57:24,919 --> 02:57:26,590
something moves them something must move
the thing that is moving it so there

9258
02:57:26,590 --> 02:57:26,600
the thing that is moving it so there
 

9259
02:57:26,600 --> 02:57:29,139
the thing that is moving it so there
must be a prime mover this idea to say

9260
02:57:29,139 --> 02:57:29,149
must be a prime mover this idea to say
 

9261
02:57:29,149 --> 02:57:30,819
must be a prime mover this idea to say
that this prime mover is a supernatural

9262
02:57:30,819 --> 02:57:30,829
that this prime mover is a supernatural
 

9263
02:57:30,829 --> 02:57:32,500
that this prime mover is a supernatural
being is complete nonsense

9264
02:57:32,500 --> 02:57:32,510
being is complete nonsense
 

9265
02:57:32,510 --> 02:57:35,679
being is complete nonsense
right it's an automaton in the simplest

9266
02:57:35,679 --> 02:57:35,689
right it's an automaton in the simplest
 

9267
02:57:35,689 --> 02:57:38,079
right it's an automaton in the simplest
case so we have to explain the enormity

9268
02:57:38,079 --> 02:57:38,089
case so we have to explain the enormity
 

9269
02:57:38,089 --> 02:57:40,510
case so we have to explain the enormity
that this automaton exists at all but

9270
02:57:40,510 --> 02:57:40,520
that this automaton exists at all but
 

9271
02:57:40,520 --> 02:57:43,359
that this automaton exists at all but
again we don't have any possibility to

9272
02:57:43,359 --> 02:57:43,369
again we don't have any possibility to
 

9273
02:57:43,369 --> 02:57:45,219
again we don't have any possibility to
infer anything about its properties

9274
02:57:45,219 --> 02:57:45,229
infer anything about its properties
 

9275
02:57:45,229 --> 02:57:48,309
infer anything about its properties
except that it's able to produce change

9276
02:57:48,309 --> 02:57:48,319
except that it's able to produce change
 

9277
02:57:48,319 --> 02:57:50,920
except that it's able to produce change
in information right so there needs to

9278
02:57:50,920 --> 02:57:50,930
in information right so there needs to
 

9279
02:57:50,930 --> 02:57:52,630
in information right so there needs to
be some kind of computational principle

9280
02:57:52,630 --> 02:57:52,640
be some kind of computational principle
 

9281
02:57:52,640 --> 02:57:54,579
be some kind of computational principle
this is all there is but to say this

9282
02:57:54,579 --> 02:57:54,589
this is all there is but to say this
 

9283
02:57:54,589 --> 02:57:56,559
this is all there is but to say this
automaton is identical again with the

9284
02:57:56,559 --> 02:57:56,569
automaton is identical again with the
 

9285
02:57:56,569 --> 02:57:58,420
automaton is identical again with the
creator of first cause over the thing

9286
02:57:58,420 --> 02:57:58,430
creator of first cause over the thing
 

9287
02:57:58,430 --> 02:58:00,569
creator of first cause over the thing
that gives meaning to our life is

9288
02:58:00,569 --> 02:58:00,579
that gives meaning to our life is
 

9289
02:58:00,579 --> 02:58:03,219
that gives meaning to our life is
confusion now I think that what we

9290
02:58:03,219 --> 02:58:03,229
confusion now I think that what we
 

9291
02:58:03,229 --> 02:58:06,309
confusion now I think that what we
perceive is the higher being that we are

9292
02:58:06,309 --> 02:58:06,319
perceive is the higher being that we are
 

9293
02:58:06,319 --> 02:58:08,409
perceive is the higher being that we are
part of and the higher being that we are

9294
02:58:08,409 --> 02:58:08,419
part of and the higher being that we are
 

9295
02:58:08,419 --> 02:58:10,840
part of and the higher being that we are
part of is the civilization it's the

9296
02:58:10,840 --> 02:58:10,850
part of is the civilization it's the
 

9297
02:58:10,850 --> 02:58:12,040
part of is the civilization it's the
thing in which you have a similar

9298
02:58:12,040 --> 02:58:12,050
thing in which you have a similar
 

9299
02:58:12,050 --> 02:58:13,960
thing in which you have a similar
relationship as the cell has 12 a body

9300
02:58:13,960 --> 02:58:13,970
relationship as the cell has 12 a body
 

9301
02:58:13,970 --> 02:58:17,439
relationship as the cell has 12 a body
and we have this prior because we have

9302
02:58:17,439 --> 02:58:17,449
and we have this prior because we have
 

9303
02:58:17,449 --> 02:58:19,420
and we have this prior because we have
evolved to organize in these structures

9304
02:58:19,420 --> 02:58:19,430
evolved to organize in these structures
 

9305
02:58:19,430 --> 02:58:23,139
evolved to organize in these structures
so basically the Christian God in its

9306
02:58:23,139 --> 02:58:23,149
so basically the Christian God in its
 

9307
02:58:23,149 --> 02:58:24,939
so basically the Christian God in its
natural form without the mythology if

9308
02:58:24,939 --> 02:58:24,949
natural form without the mythology if
 

9309
02:58:24,949 --> 02:58:26,739
natural form without the mythology if
you to undress it it's basically the

9310
02:58:26,739 --> 02:58:26,749
you to undress it it's basically the
 

9311
02:58:26,749 --> 02:58:30,260
you to undress it it's basically the
Platonic form of the civilization

9312
02:58:30,260 --> 02:58:30,270
Platonic form of the civilization
 

9313
02:58:30,270 --> 02:58:33,710
Platonic form of the civilization
is the is the ideal it's this ideal that

9314
02:58:33,710 --> 02:58:33,720
is the is the ideal it's this ideal that
 

9315
02:58:33,720 --> 02:58:35,359

you try to approximate when you interact

9316
02:58:35,359 --> 02:58:35,369
you try to approximate when you interact
 

9317
02:58:35,369 --> 02:58:37,639
you try to approximate when you interact
with others not based on your incentives

9318
02:58:37,639 --> 02:58:37,649
with others not based on your incentives
 

9319
02:58:37,649 --> 02:58:40,120

Wow we covered a lot of ground and we
