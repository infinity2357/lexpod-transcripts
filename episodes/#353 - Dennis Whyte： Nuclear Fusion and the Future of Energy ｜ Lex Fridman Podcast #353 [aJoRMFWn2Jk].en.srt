00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,490
here's Dennis White
let's start with a big question what is

28
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:34,500
let's start with a big question what is
 

29
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,650
let's start with a big question what is
nuclear fusion is the underlying process

30
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:36,660
nuclear fusion is the underlying process
 

31
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,350
nuclear fusion is the underlying process
that powers the universe so as the name

32
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:39,360
that powers the universe so as the name
 

33
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,229
that powers the universe so as the name
implies it fuses together or brings

34
00:00:42,229 --> 00:00:42,239
implies it fuses together or brings
 

35
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:43,270
implies it fuses together or brings
together

36
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:43,280
together
 

37
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,610
together
two different elements technically

38
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:46,620
two different elements technically
 

39
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,970
two different elements technically
nuclei that come together and if you can

40
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:49,980
nuclei that come together and if you can
 

41
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,310
nuclei that come together and if you can
push them together close enough that you

42
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:52,320
push them together close enough that you
 

43
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,310
push them together close enough that you
can trigger essentially a reaction what

44
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:55,320
can trigger essentially a reaction what
 

45
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,350
can trigger essentially a reaction what
happens is that the the element

46
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:57,360
happens is that the the element
 

47
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,930
happens is that the the element
typically changes so this means that you

48
00:00:59,930 --> 00:00:59,940
typically changes so this means that you
 

49
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,310
typically changes so this means that you
change from one element to another

50
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:01,320
change from one element to another
 

51
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,830
change from one element to another
chemical element to another underlying

52
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:03,840
chemical element to another underlying
 

53
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,390
chemical element to another underlying
what this means is that you change the

54
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:05,400
what this means is that you change the
 

55
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,670
what this means is that you change the
nuclear structure this rearrangement

56
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:07,680
nuclear structure this rearrangement
 

57
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,890
nuclear structure this rearrangement
through equals mc squared releases large

58
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:09,900
through equals mc squared releases large
 

59
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,010
through equals mc squared releases large
amounts of energy so Fusion is the

60
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:13,020
amounts of energy so Fusion is the
 

61
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,649
amounts of energy so Fusion is the
fusing together of lighter elements into

62
00:01:15,649 --> 00:01:15,659
fusing together of lighter elements into
 

63
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:18,410
fusing together of lighter elements into
heavier elements and when you go through

64
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:18,420
heavier elements and when you go through
 

65
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,330
heavier elements and when you go through
it you say oh look so here are the

66
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:20,340
it you say oh look so here are the
 

67
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,270
it you say oh look so here are the
initial elements typically hydrogen and

68
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:23,280
initial elements typically hydrogen and
 

69
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,210
initial elements typically hydrogen and
they had a particular Mass rest Mass

70
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:26,220
they had a particular Mass rest Mass
 

71
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,890
they had a particular Mass rest Mass
which means just the mass when they're

72
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:27,900
which means just the mass when they're
 

73
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,469
which means just the mass when they're
with no kinetic energy and when you look

74
00:01:30,469 --> 00:01:30,479
with no kinetic energy and when you look
 

75
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,270
with no kinetic energy and when you look
at the product afterwards it has less

76
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:32,280
at the product afterwards it has less
 

77
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,789
at the product afterwards it has less
rest mass and so you go well how is that

78
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:34,799
rest mass and so you go well how is that
 

79
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,590
rest mass and so you go well how is that
possible because you have to keep Mass

80
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:36,600
possible because you have to keep Mass
 

81
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,569
possible because you have to keep Mass
but mass and energy are the same thing

82
00:01:38,569 --> 00:01:38,579
but mass and energy are the same thing
 

83
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:40,670
but mass and energy are the same thing
which which is what equals mc squared

84
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:40,680
which which is what equals mc squared
 

85
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,550
which which is what equals mc squared
means and the the conversion of this

86
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:43,560
means and the the conversion of this
 

87
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,950
means and the the conversion of this
comes into kinetic energy namely energy

88
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:45,960
comes into kinetic energy namely energy
 

89
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,770
comes into kinetic energy namely energy
that you can use in some way and that's

90
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:48,780
that you can use in some way and that's
 

91
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,770
that you can use in some way and that's
what happens in the center of stars so

92
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:51,780
what happens in the center of stars so
 

93
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,069
what happens in the center of stars so
Fusion is literally the reason life is

94
00:01:55,069 --> 00:01:55,079
Fusion is literally the reason life is
 

95
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:59,090
Fusion is literally the reason life is
is viable in the universe so Fusion is

96
00:01:59,090 --> 00:01:59,100
is viable in the universe so Fusion is
 

97
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,889
is viable in the universe so Fusion is
happening in our sun and what are the

98
00:02:00,889 --> 00:02:00,899
happening in our sun and what are the
 

99
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:03,770
happening in our sun and what are the
elements the elements are hydrogen that

100
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:03,780
elements the elements are hydrogen that
 

101
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,289
elements the elements are hydrogen that
are coming together it goes through a

102
00:02:06,289 --> 00:02:06,299
are coming together it goes through a
 

103
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:07,910
are coming together it goes through a
process which just probably gets a

104
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:07,920
process which just probably gets a
 

105
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,609
process which just probably gets a
little bit too detailed but there's it's

106
00:02:10,609 --> 00:02:10,619
little bit too detailed but there's it's
 

107
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:13,550
little bit too detailed but there's it's
a somewhat complex catalyzed process

108
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:13,560
a somewhat complex catalyzed process
 

109
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,670
a somewhat complex catalyzed process
that happens in the center of stars but

110
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:16,680
that happens in the center of stars but
 

111
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,890
that happens in the center of stars but
in the end stars are Big Balls of

112
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:18,900
in the end stars are Big Balls of
 

113
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,930
in the end stars are Big Balls of
hydrogen which is the lightest it's the

114
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:20,940
hydrogen which is the lightest it's the
 

115
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,369
hydrogen which is the lightest it's the
simplest element the lightest element

116
00:02:22,369 --> 00:02:22,379
simplest element the lightest element
 

117
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:24,110
simplest element the lightest element
the most abundant element most of the

118
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:24,120
the most abundant element most of the
 

119
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,690
the most abundant element most of the
universe is hydrogen and and it's

120
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:26,700
universe is hydrogen and and it's
 

121
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,250
universe is hydrogen and and it's
essentially a sequence through which

122
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:28,260
essentially a sequence through which
 

123
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,470
essentially a sequence through which
these processes occur that you end up

124
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:30,480
these processes occur that you end up
 

125
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,610
these processes occur that you end up
with helium

126
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:31,620
with helium
 

127
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,410
with helium
so those are the primary things and the

128
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:33,420
so those are the primary things and the
 

129
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,390
so those are the primary things and the
reason for this is because

130
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:35,400
reason for this is because
 

131
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,990
reason for this is because
helium has features as a nucleus like

132
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:39,000
helium has features as a nucleus like
 

133
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,930
helium has features as a nucleus like
the interior part of the atom that is

134
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:41,940
the interior part of the atom that is
 

135
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,390
the interior part of the atom that is
extremely stable and the reason for this

136
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:44,400
extremely stable and the reason for this
 

137
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,910
extremely stable and the reason for this
is helium has two protons and two

138
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:46,920
is helium has two protons and two
 

139
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,710
is helium has two protons and two
neutrons these are the things that make

140
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:48,720
neutrons these are the things that make
 

141
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,990
neutrons these are the things that make
up nuclei that make up all of us along

142
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:51,000
up nuclei that make up all of us along
 

143
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,210
up nuclei that make up all of us along
with electrons and because it has two

144
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:53,220
with electrons and because it has two
 

145
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:56,809
with electrons and because it has two
pairs it's extremely stable and for this

146
00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:56,819
pairs it's extremely stable and for this
 

147
00:02:56,819 --> 00:03:00,050
pairs it's extremely stable and for this
reason it when you convert the hydrogen

148
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:00,060
reason it when you convert the hydrogen
 

149
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,270
reason it when you convert the hydrogen
into helium it just wants to stay helium

150
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:02,280
into helium it just wants to stay helium
 

151
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,729
into helium it just wants to stay helium
and it wants to release kinetic energy

152
00:03:04,729 --> 00:03:04,739
and it wants to release kinetic energy
 

153
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:07,070
and it wants to release kinetic energy
so stars are

154
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:07,080
so stars are
 

155
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,009
so stars are
basically conversion engines of hydrogen

156
00:03:10,009 --> 00:03:10,019
basically conversion engines of hydrogen
 

157
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:13,850
basically conversion engines of hydrogen
into helium and I mean this also tells

158
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:13,860
into helium and I mean this also tells
 

159
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,070
into helium and I mean this also tells
you why you love Fusion I mean because

160
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:16,080
you why you love Fusion I mean because
 

161
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,770
you why you love Fusion I mean because
our sun will last you know 10 billion

162
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:18,780
our sun will last you know 10 billion
 

163
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,470
our sun will last you know 10 billion
years approximately that's along the

164
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:21,480
years approximately that's along the
 

165
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,990
years approximately that's along the
fuel will last but to do that kind of

166
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:24,000
fuel will last but to do that kind of
 

167
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,309
fuel will last but to do that kind of
conversion you have to have extremely

168
00:03:25,309 --> 00:03:25,319
conversion you have to have extremely
 

169
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:27,649
conversion you have to have extremely
high temperatures it is one of the

170
00:03:27,649 --> 00:03:27,659
high temperatures it is one of the
 

171
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:29,390
high temperatures it is one of the
criteria for doing this but it's the

172
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:29,400
criteria for doing this but it's the
 

173
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,190
criteria for doing this but it's the
easiest one to understand and why is

174
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:31,200
easiest one to understand and why is
 

175
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,670
easiest one to understand and why is
this it's because

176
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:33,680
this it's because
 

177
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,229
this it's because
effectively what this requires is that

178
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:36,239
effectively what this requires is that
 

179
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,190
effectively what this requires is that
these hydrogen uh ions or which is

180
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:40,200
these hydrogen uh ions or which is
 

181
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,050
these hydrogen uh ions or which is
really the bare nucleus so they have a

182
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:42,060
really the bare nucleus so they have a
 

183
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,490
really the bare nucleus so they have a
positive charge everything has a

184
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:43,500
positive charge everything has a
 

185
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,710
positive charge everything has a
positive charge of those ones is that to

186
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:45,720
positive charge of those ones is that to
 

187
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,630
positive charge of those ones is that to
get them to to trigger this reaction

188
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:47,640
get them to to trigger this reaction
 

189
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,449
get them to to trigger this reaction
they must approach within distances

190
00:03:50,449 --> 00:03:50,459
they must approach within distances
 

191
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:52,550
they must approach within distances
which are like the size of the nucleus

192
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:52,560
which are like the size of the nucleus
 

193
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,890
which are like the size of the nucleus
itself because the nature in fact what

00:03:56,449 --> 00:03:56,459
it's really using is something called
 

197
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:58,250
it's really using is something called
the strong nuclear force there's four

198
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:58,260
the strong nuclear force there's four
 

199
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,229
the strong nuclear force there's four
fundamental forces in the universe this

200
00:04:00,229 --> 00:04:00,239
fundamental forces in the universe this
 

201
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,390
fundamental forces in the universe this
is the strongest one but it has a

202
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:02,400
is the strongest one but it has a
 

203
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,550
is the strongest one but it has a
strange property is that it while it's

204
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:04,560
strange property is that it while it's
 

205
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,130
strange property is that it while it's
the strongest force by far it only has

206
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:07,140
the strongest force by far it only has
 

207
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,530
the strongest force by far it only has
impact over distances which are the size

208
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:09,540
impact over distances which are the size
 

209
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,170
impact over distances which are the size
of a nucleus so to get put that into

210
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:12,180
of a nucleus so to get put that into
 

211
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,110
of a nucleus so to get put that into
what does that mean it's a millionth of

212
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:15,120
what does that mean it's a millionth of
 

213
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,590
what does that mean it's a millionth of
a billionth of a meter okay incredibly

214
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:18,600
a billionth of a meter okay incredibly
 

215
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,509
a billionth of a meter okay incredibly
small distances but because the

216
00:04:20,509 --> 00:04:20,519
small distances but because the
 

217
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,550
small distances but because the
distances are small and the particles

218
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:22,560
distances are small and the particles
 

219
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,129
distances are small and the particles
have charge they want to push strongly

220
00:04:25,129 --> 00:04:25,139
have charge they want to push strongly
 

221
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:27,170
have charge they want to push strongly
apart namely they have repulsion that

222
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:27,180
apart namely they have repulsion that
 

223
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,150
apart namely they have repulsion that
wants to push them apart so it turns

224
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:29,160
wants to push them apart so it turns
 

225
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,610
wants to push them apart so it turns
when you go through the math of this the

226
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:31,620
when you go through the math of this the
 

227
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,129
when you go through the math of this the
average velocity or energy of the

228
00:04:34,129 --> 00:04:34,139
average velocity or energy of the
 

229
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:37,249
average velocity or energy of the
particles must be very high to have any

230
00:04:37,249 --> 00:04:37,259
particles must be very high to have any
 

231
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:39,350
particles must be very high to have any
significant probability of the reactions

232
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:39,360
significant probability of the reactions
 

233
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,870
significant probability of the reactions
happening and so the center of our sun

234
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:41,880
happening and so the center of our sun
 

235
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,249
happening and so the center of our sun
is at about 20 million degrees Celsius

236
00:04:45,249 --> 00:04:45,259
is at about 20 million degrees Celsius
 

237
00:04:45,259 --> 00:04:47,990
is at about 20 million degrees Celsius
and on Earth this means it's one of the

238
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:48,000
and on Earth this means it's one of the
 

239
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,730
and on Earth this means it's one of the
first things we teach you know entering

240
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:49,740
first things we teach you know entering
 

241
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:52,610
first things we teach you know entering
graduate students you can do a quick you

242
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:52,620
graduate students you can do a quick you
 

243
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,650
graduate students you can do a quick you
can do a quick basically Power Balance

244
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:54,660
can do a quick basically Power Balance
 

245
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,270
can do a quick basically Power Balance
and you can you can determine that on

246
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:56,280
and you can you can determine that on
 

247
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,830
and you can you can determine that on
Earth that it requires a minimum

248
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:57,840
Earth that it requires a minimum
 

249
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,230
Earth that it requires a minimum
temperature of about 50 million degrees

250
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:00,240
temperature of about 50 million degrees
 

251
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,090
temperature of about 50 million degrees
Celsius on Earth

252
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:02,100
Celsius on Earth
 

253
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,530

to perform Fusion to get enough Fusion

254
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:05,540
to perform Fusion to get enough Fusion
 

255
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:08,689
to perform Fusion to get enough Fusion
that you would be able to make get

256
00:05:08,689 --> 00:05:08,699
that you would be able to make get
 

257
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:10,730
that you would be able to make get
energy gain out of it

258
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:10,740
energy gain out of it
 

259
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,890
energy gain out of it
so you can trigger Fusion reactions at

260
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:12,900
so you can trigger Fusion reactions at
 

261
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,749
so you can trigger Fusion reactions at
lower energy but they become almost

262
00:05:14,749 --> 00:05:14,759
lower energy but they become almost
 

263
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:16,850
lower energy but they become almost
vanishingly small at lower temperatures

264
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:16,860
vanishingly small at lower temperatures
 

265
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,050
vanishingly small at lower temperatures
than that

266
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:18,060
than that
 

267
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,490
than that
first of all let me just link around

268
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:19,500
first of all let me just link around
 

269
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,490
first of all let me just link around
some crazy ideas so uh one the strong

270
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:22,500
some crazy ideas so uh one the strong
 

271
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,469
some crazy ideas so uh one the strong
force just stepping out and looking at

272
00:05:24,469 --> 00:05:24,479
force just stepping out and looking at
 

273
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,210
force just stepping out and looking at
all the physics

274
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:26,220
all the physics
 

275
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,189
all the physics
is it weird to you that there's these

276
00:05:28,189 --> 00:05:28,199
is it weird to you that there's these
 

277
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:31,129
is it weird to you that there's these
forces and they're very particular like

278
00:05:31,129 --> 00:05:31,139
forces and they're very particular like
 

279
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:32,390
forces and they're very particular like
it operates at a very small distance

280
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:32,400
it operates at a very small distance
 

281
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,430
it operates at a very small distance
then gravity operates at a very large

282
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:34,440
then gravity operates at a very large
 

283
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,830
then gravity operates at a very large
distance and and they're all very

284
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:36,840
distance and and they're all very
 

285
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,890
distance and and they're all very
specific in the standard model describes

286
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:38,900
specific in the standard model describes
 

287
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,330
specific in the standard model describes
uh three of those forces extremely well

288
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:41,340
uh three of those forces extremely well
 

289
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,430
uh three of those forces extremely well
and there's and this is one of them and

290
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:43,440
and there's and this is one of them and
 

291
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,990
and there's and this is one of them and
yeah this is one of them and it's just

292
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:45,000
yeah this is one of them and it's just
 

293
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,749
yeah this is one of them and it's just
all kind of works out there's a big part

294
00:05:47,749 --> 00:05:47,759
all kind of works out there's a big part
 

295
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,749
all kind of works out there's a big part
of you that's uh you know an engineer

296
00:05:50,749 --> 00:05:50,759
of you that's uh you know an engineer
 

297
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:52,969
of you that's uh you know an engineer
that used to step back and almost look

298
00:05:52,969 --> 00:05:52,979
that used to step back and almost look
 

299
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:54,830
that used to step back and almost look
at the philosophy of physics

300
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:54,840
at the philosophy of physics
 

301
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,810
at the philosophy of physics
so it's interesting because as a

302
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:56,820
so it's interesting because as a
 

303
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,850
so it's interesting because as a
scientist I see the universe through

304
00:05:58,850 --> 00:05:58,860
scientist I see the universe through
 

305
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,070
scientist I see the universe through
that lens of essentially the interesting

306
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:01,080
that lens of essentially the interesting
 

307
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,689
that lens of essentially the interesting
things that we do are through the forces

308
00:06:02,689 --> 00:06:02,699
things that we do are through the forces
 

309
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:05,270
things that we do are through the forces
that are get used around those and

310
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:05,280
that are get used around those and
 

311
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,490
that are get used around those and
everything works because of that

312
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:07,500
everything works because of that
 

313
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,590
everything works because of that

almost all all physicists and then part

326
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:20,100
almost all all physicists and then part
 

327
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,189
almost all all physicists and then part
of it was because of what you said he

328
00:06:22,189 --> 00:06:22,199
of it was because of what you said he
 

329
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:23,990
of it was because of what you said he
kind of looked through a different lens

330
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:24,000
kind of looked through a different lens
 

331
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,809
kind of looked through a different lens
at these but typically look like very

332
00:06:26,809 --> 00:06:26,819
at these but typically look like very
 

333
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:29,689
at these but typically look like very
dry like equations and relationships and

334
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:29,699
dry like equations and relationships and
 

335
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:31,670
dry like equations and relationships and
he kind of I think he brought out the

336
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:31,680
he kind of I think he brought out the
 

337
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,590
he kind of I think he brought out the
Wonder of it in some sense right for for

338
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:33,600
Wonder of it in some sense right for for
 

339
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,469
Wonder of it in some sense right for for
those he posited what would be if you

340
00:06:36,469 --> 00:06:36,479
those he posited what would be if you
 

341
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,689
those he posited what would be if you
could write down a single not even

342
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:38,699
could write down a single not even
 

343
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:41,150
could write down a single not even
really a sentence but a single concept

344
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:41,160
really a sentence but a single concept
 

345
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,309
really a sentence but a single concept
that was the most important thing

346
00:06:43,309 --> 00:06:43,319
that was the most important thing
 

347
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,290
that was the most important thing
scientifically that we that we knew

348
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:45,300
scientifically that we that we knew
 

349
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,730
scientifically that we that we knew
about that in other words you had only

350
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:46,740
about that in other words you had only
 

351
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,249
about that in other words you had only
one thing that you could transmit like a

352
00:06:49,249 --> 00:06:49,259
one thing that you could transmit like a
 

353
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:51,950
one thing that you could transmit like a
future or past generation it was very

354
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:51,960
future or past generation it was very
 

355
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,930
future or past generation it was very
interesting it was um so it's not what

356
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:53,940
interesting it was um so it's not what
 

357
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,430
interesting it was um so it's not what
you think it wasn't like oh strong

358
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:55,440
you think it wasn't like oh strong
 

359
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,469
you think it wasn't like oh strong
nuclear force or Fusion or something

360
00:06:57,469 --> 00:06:57,479
nuclear force or Fusion or something
 

361
00:06:57,479 --> 00:07:00,170
nuclear force or Fusion or something
like this and it's very profound which

362
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:00,180
like this and it's very profound which
 

363
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:04,129
like this and it's very profound which
was he was that the reason that matter

364
00:07:04,129 --> 00:07:04,139
was he was that the reason that matter
 

365
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:06,529
was he was that the reason that matter
operates the way that it does is because

366
00:07:06,529 --> 00:07:06,539
operates the way that it does is because
 

367
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:09,590
operates the way that it does is because
all matter is made up of individual

368
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:09,600
all matter is made up of individual
 

369
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,510
all matter is made up of individual
particles that interact each other

370
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:11,520
particles that interact each other
 

371
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,450
particles that interact each other
through forces that was it so just that

372
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:14,460
through forces that was it so just that
 

373
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,670
through forces that was it so just that
atomic theory basically yeah

374
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:16,680
atomic theory basically yeah
 

375
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,129
atomic theory basically yeah
which is like wow that's like so simple

376
00:07:19,129 --> 00:07:19,139
which is like wow that's like so simple
 

377
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:21,890
which is like wow that's like so simple
but it's not so simple it's because like

378
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:21,900
but it's not so simple it's because like
 

379
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,110
but it's not so simple it's because like
who thinks about atoms that they're made

380
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:24,120
who thinks about atoms that they're made
 

381
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,689
who thinks about atoms that they're made
of like I I this is a good this is a

382
00:07:26,689 --> 00:07:26,699
of like I I this is a good this is a
 

383
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:28,070
of like I I this is a good this is a
good question I give to my students how

384
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,080
good question I give to my students how
 

385
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,689
good question I give to my students how
many atoms are in your body like almost

386
00:07:29,689 --> 00:07:29,699
many atoms are in your body like almost
 

387
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,370
many atoms are in your body like almost
no students can answer this but to me

388
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:31,380
no students can answer this but to me
 

389
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,290
no students can answer this but to me
that's like a fundamental thing by the

390
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:33,300
that's like a fundamental thing by the
 

391
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,990
that's like a fundamental thing by the
way it's about 10 to the 28. out of 28.

392
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:36,000
way it's about 10 to the 28. out of 28.
 

393
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,350
way it's about 10 to the 28. out of 28.
so that's uh you know trillion or you

394
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:39,360
so that's uh you know trillion or you
 

395
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,969
so that's uh you know trillion or you
know million trillion trillion or

396
00:07:40,969 --> 00:07:40,979
know million trillion trillion or
 

397
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:42,529
know million trillion trillion or
something like that yes so one thing is

398
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:42,539
something like that yes so one thing is
 

399
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:43,790
something like that yes so one thing is
to think about the number and the other

400
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:43,800
to think about the number and the other
 

401
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,189
to think about the number and the other
is to start to really Ponder the fact

402
00:07:46,189 --> 00:07:46,199
is to start to really Ponder the fact
 

403
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,110
is to start to really Ponder the fact
that it all holds together yeah it all

404
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:48,120
that it all holds together yeah it all
 

405
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,610
that it all holds together yeah it all
holds together and you're actually that

406
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:49,620
holds together and you're actually that
 

407
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,409
holds together and you're actually that
you're more that than you are anything

408
00:07:51,409 --> 00:07:51,419
you're more that than you are anything
 

409
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:54,050
you're more that than you are anything
else yes exactly yeah no I mean there

410
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:54,060
else yes exactly yeah no I mean there
 

411
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,809
else yes exactly yeah no I mean there
are people who do study such things of

412
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:56,819
are people who do study such things of
 

413
00:07:56,819 --> 00:07:59,330
are people who do study such things of
the fact that if you look at the for

414
00:07:59,330 --> 00:07:59,340
the fact that if you look at the for
 

415
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,010
the fact that if you look at the for
example the ratios between those

416
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:01,020
example the ratios between those
 

417
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,350
example the ratios between those
fundamental forces people have figured

418
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:03,360
fundamental forces people have figured
 

419
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,270
fundamental forces people have figured
out oh if this ratio was different by

420
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:05,280
out oh if this ratio was different by
 

421
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,129
out oh if this ratio was different by
some Factor like a factor of two or

422
00:08:07,129 --> 00:08:07,139
some Factor like a factor of two or
 

423
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:08,689
some Factor like a factor of two or
something I was like oh this would all

424
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:08,699
something I was like oh this would all
 

425
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:11,150
something I was like oh this would all
like not work and I look you look at the

426
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:11,160
like not work and I look you look at the
 

427
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,070
like not work and I look you look at the
sun right it's like so it turns out that

428
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:13,080
sun right it's like so it turns out that
 

429
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,129
sun right it's like so it turns out that
there are key reactions that if they had

430
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:16,139
there are key reactions that if they had
 

431
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:18,230
there are key reactions that if they had
slightly lower or probability no star

432
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:18,240
slightly lower or probability no star
 

433
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,110
slightly lower or probability no star
would ever ignite and then life wouldn't

434
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:21,120
would ever ignite and then life wouldn't
 

435
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,350
would ever ignite and then life wouldn't
be possible it does seem like the

436
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:23,360
be possible it does seem like the
 

437
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,290
be possible it does seem like the
universe set things up for us that it's

438
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:27,300
universe set things up for us that it's
 

439
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,629
universe set things up for us that it's
possible to do some cool things but it's

440
00:08:29,629 --> 00:08:29,639
possible to do some cool things but it's
 

441
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:32,329
possible to do some cool things but it's
challenging so that that keeps it fun

442
00:08:32,329 --> 00:08:32,339
challenging so that that keeps it fun
 

443
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:34,310
challenging so that that keeps it fun
for us yeah yeah that's the way I look

444
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:34,320
for us yeah yeah that's the way I look
 

445
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,589
for us yeah yeah that's the way I look
at it I mean the you know the Multiverse

446
00:08:36,589 --> 00:08:36,599
at it I mean the you know the Multiverse
 

447
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,690
at it I mean the you know the Multiverse
model is an interesting one uh because

448
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:38,700
model is an interesting one uh because
 

449
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,430
model is an interesting one uh because
there are you know Quantum scientists

450
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:40,440
there are you know Quantum scientists
 

451
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,870
there are you know Quantum scientists
who look at and figure I was like oh

452
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:41,880
who look at and figure I was like oh
 

453
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,730
who look at and figure I was like oh
it's like oh yeah like Quantum science

454
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:43,740
it's like oh yeah like Quantum science
 

455
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,350
it's like oh yeah like Quantum science
perhaps tells us that there are almost

456
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:45,360
perhaps tells us that there are almost
 

457
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,630
perhaps tells us that there are almost
an infinite you know variety of other

458
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:47,640
an infinite you know variety of other
 

459
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,090
an infinite you know variety of other
universes but the way that it works

460
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:50,100
universes but the way that it works
 

461
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,310
universes but the way that it works
probably is it's almost like a form of

462
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:52,320
probably is it's almost like a form of
 

463
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,350
probably is it's almost like a form of
natural selection it's like well the

464
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:54,360
natural selection it's like well the
 

465
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,269
natural selection it's like well the
universes that didn't have the correct

466
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:56,279
universes that didn't have the correct
 

467
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:58,490
universes that didn't have the correct
or interesting relationships between

468
00:08:58,490 --> 00:08:58,500
or interesting relationships between
 

469
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,190
or interesting relationships between
these forces nothing happens in them so

470
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:01,200
these forces nothing happens in them so
 

471
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,810
these forces nothing happens in them so
almost by definition the fact that we're

472
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:02,820
almost by definition the fact that we're
 

473
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,850
almost by definition the fact that we're
having this conversation means that

474
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:04,860
having this conversation means that
 

475
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,410
having this conversation means that
we're in one of the interesting ones by

476
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:06,420
we're in one of the interesting ones by
 

477
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,430
we're in one of the interesting ones by
default

478
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:07,440
default
 

479
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,410
default
yeah one of the somewhat interesting but

480
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:09,420
yeah one of the somewhat interesting but
 

481
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,630
yeah one of the somewhat interesting but
there's probably super interesting ones

482
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:11,640
there's probably super interesting ones
 

483
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,990
there's probably super interesting ones
we I I tend to think of humans as

484
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:15,000
we I I tend to think of humans as
 

485
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,329
we I I tend to think of humans as
incredible creatures our brain is is an

486
00:09:17,329 --> 00:09:17,339
incredible creatures our brain is is an
 

487
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:19,790
incredible creatures our brain is is an
incredible Computing device but

488
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:19,800
incredible Computing device but
 

489
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,190
incredible Computing device but
I think we're also extremely cognitively

490
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:22,200
I think we're also extremely cognitively
 

491
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,410
I think we're also extremely cognitively
limited I can imagine

492
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:24,420
limited I can imagine
 

493
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,329
limited I can imagine
alien civilizations that are much much

494
00:09:26,329 --> 00:09:26,339
alien civilizations that are much much
 

495
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:29,210
alien civilizations that are much much
much much more intelligent uh in ways we

496
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:29,220
much much more intelligent uh in ways we
 

497
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,889
much much more intelligent uh in ways we
can't even comprehend in terms of their

498
00:09:30,889 --> 00:09:30,899
can't even comprehend in terms of their
 

499
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:33,710
can't even comprehend in terms of their
ability to come to construct models of

500
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:33,720
ability to come to construct models of
 

501
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,389
ability to come to construct models of
the world and to do physics to do

502
00:09:35,389 --> 00:09:35,399
the world and to do physics to do
 

503
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:37,670
the world and to do physics to do
physics and Mathematics I would see it

504
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:37,680
physics and Mathematics I would see it
 

505
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,650
physics and Mathematics I would see it
in a slightly different way it's

506
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:39,660
in a slightly different way it's
 

507
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,290
in a slightly different way it's
actually it's because we have

508
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:42,300
actually it's because we have
 

509
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,810
actually it's because we have
um we have we have creatures that live

510
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:44,820
um we have we have creatures that live
 

511
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,670
um we have we have creatures that live
with us on the earth that have cognition

512
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:46,680
with us on the earth that have cognition
 

513
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,650
with us on the earth that have cognition
right that understand and move through

514
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:48,660
right that understand and move through
 

515
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,110
right that understand and move through
their environment but they they actually

516
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:51,120
their environment but they they actually
 

517
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,110
their environment but they they actually
see things in a way or they sense things

518
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:54,120
see things in a way or they sense things
 

519
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,790
see things in a way or they sense things
in a way which is so fundamentally

520
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:55,800
in a way which is so fundamentally
 

521
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,490
in a way which is so fundamentally
different it's really hard like the TR

522
00:09:58,490 --> 00:09:58,500
different it's really hard like the TR
 

523
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,949
different it's really hard like the TR
it's the problem is the translation not

524
00:10:00,949 --> 00:10:00,959
it's the problem is the translation not
 

525
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,570
it's the problem is the translation not
necessarily intelligence so it's the

526
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:02,580
necessarily intelligence so it's the
 

527
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,430
necessarily intelligence so it's the
perception of the world so I have a dog

528
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:04,440
perception of the world so I have a dog
 

529
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,370
perception of the world so I have a dog
and when I go out and I see my dog like

530
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:07,380
and when I go out and I see my dog like
 

531
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,650
and when I go out and I see my dog like
smelling things there's a realization

532
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:09,660
smelling things there's a realization
 

533
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:13,370
smelling things there's a realization
that I have that he sees or senses the

534
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:13,380
that I have that he sees or senses the
 

535
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,170
that I have that he sees or senses the
world in a way that I can never like I

536
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:15,180
world in a way that I can never like I
 

537
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,670
world in a way that I can never like I
can't understand it because I can't

538
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:16,680
can't understand it because I can't
 

539
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,190
can't understand it because I can't
translate my way to this we get little

540
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:19,200
translate my way to this we get little
 

541
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,170
translate my way to this we get little
glimpses of this as humans though by the

542
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:21,180
glimpses of this as humans though by the
 

543
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,090
glimpses of this as humans though by the
way because there are some parts of it

544
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:23,100
way because there are some parts of it
 

545
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,910
way because there are some parts of it
for example Optical information which

546
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:25,920
for example Optical information which
 

547
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,009
for example Optical information which
comes from light isn't now because we've

548
00:10:28,009 --> 00:10:28,019
comes from light isn't now because we've
 

549
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:30,050
comes from light isn't now because we've
developed the technology we can actually

550
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:30,060
developed the technology we can actually
 

551
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:32,990
developed the technology we can actually
see things you know I've had I get this

552
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:33,000
see things you know I've had I get this
 

553
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,449
see things you know I've had I get this
you know as a one of my areas of

554
00:10:35,449 --> 00:10:35,459
you know as a one of my areas of
 

555
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:37,370
you know as a one of my areas of
research is spectroscopy so this means

556
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:37,380
research is spectroscopy so this means
 

557
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,350
research is spectroscopy so this means
the study of light you know and I and I

558
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:39,360
the study of light you know and I and I
 

559
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,910
the study of light you know and I and I
get this quote unquote see things or

560
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:40,920
get this quote unquote see things or
 

561
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,310
get this quote unquote see things or
representation of them from you know the

562
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:43,320
representation of them from you know the
 

563
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,710
representation of them from you know the
far infrared all the way to like hard

564
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:45,720
far infrared all the way to like hard
 

565
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,290
far infrared all the way to like hard
hard x-rays which is several orders of

566
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:48,300
hard x-rays which is several orders of
 

567
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,449
hard x-rays which is several orders of
magnitude of the of the light intensity

568
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:50,459
magnitude of the of the light intensity
 

569
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:53,870
magnitude of the of the light intensity
but our own human eyes like see a teeny

570
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:53,880
but our own human eyes like see a teeny
 

571
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,910
but our own human eyes like see a teeny
teeny little sliver of this yeah so that

572
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:55,920
teeny little sliver of this yeah so that
 

573
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,009
teeny little sliver of this yeah so that
even like bees for example see a

574
00:10:58,009 --> 00:10:58,019
even like bees for example see a
 

575
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:00,829
even like bees for example see a
different place than we do so I don't I

576
00:11:00,829 --> 00:11:00,839
different place than we do so I don't I
 

577
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:03,230
different place than we do so I don't I
I think if you think of there's already

578
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:03,240
I think if you think of there's already
 

579
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,470
I think if you think of there's already
other intelligences like around us in a

580
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:06,480
other intelligences like around us in a
 

581
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,870
other intelligences like around us in a
way in a limited way

582
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:08,880
way in a limited way
 

583
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,829
way in a limited way
um because of the way they can

584
00:11:09,829 --> 00:11:09,839
um because of the way they can
 

585
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,810
um because of the way they can
communicate but it's like those are

586
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:11,820
communicate but it's like those are
 

587
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,930
communicate but it's like those are
already baffling in many ways yeah so if

588
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:14,940
already baffling in many ways yeah so if
 

589
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,550
already baffling in many ways yeah so if
we just focus in on the senses there's

590
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:16,560
we just focus in on the senses there's
 

591
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,829
we just focus in on the senses there's
already a lot of diversity but there's

592
00:11:18,829 --> 00:11:18,839
already a lot of diversity but there's
 

593
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:20,090
already a lot of diversity but there's
probably things we're not even

594
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:20,100
probably things we're not even
 

595
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,389
probably things we're not even
considering as possibilities for example

596
00:11:23,389 --> 00:11:23,399
considering as possibilities for example
 

597
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:27,050
considering as possibilities for example
uh whatever the heck Consciousness is

598
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:27,060
uh whatever the heck Consciousness is
 

599
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,750
uh whatever the heck Consciousness is
could actually be a door into

600
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:29,760
could actually be a door into
 

601
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,370
could actually be a door into
understanding some physical phenomena

602
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:31,380
understanding some physical phenomena
 

603
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,750
understanding some physical phenomena
we're not I haven't even begun

604
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:32,760
we're not I haven't even begun
 

605
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,370
we're not I haven't even begun
understanding so just like you said

606
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:34,380
understanding so just like you said
 

607
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,530
understanding so just like you said
spectroscopy there could be a similar

608
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:36,540
spectroscopy there could be a similar
 

609
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,090
spectroscopy there could be a similar
kind of spectrum for Consciousness that

610
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:38,100
kind of spectrum for Consciousness that
 

611
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,389
kind of spectrum for Consciousness that
we're just like we're like these dumb uh

612
00:11:41,389 --> 00:11:41,399
we're just like we're like these dumb uh
 

613
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:43,190
we're just like we're like these dumb uh
the descendants of Apes like walking

614
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:43,200
the descendants of Apes like walking
 

615
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,230
the descendants of Apes like walking
around it sure feels like something to

616
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:45,240
around it sure feels like something to
 

617
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,269
around it sure feels like something to
experience the color red but like we

618
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:47,279
experience the color red but like we
 

619
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,230
experience the color red but like we
don't have

620
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:48,240
don't have
 

621
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,210
don't have
it's the same as in the ancient times

622
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:50,220
it's the same as in the ancient times
 

623
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,949
it's the same as in the ancient times
you experience physics you experience

624
00:11:51,949 --> 00:11:51,959
you experience physics you experience
 

625
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:54,050
you experience physics you experience
light it's like oh it's bright and you

626
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:54,060
light it's like oh it's bright and you
 

627
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,150
light it's like oh it's bright and you
know yeah yeah and you construct kind of

628
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:56,160
know yeah yeah and you construct kind of
 

629
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,449
know yeah yeah and you construct kind of
uh what's interesting we might actually

630
00:11:59,449 --> 00:11:59,459
uh what's interesting we might actually
 

631
00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:01,009
uh what's interesting we might actually
experience this faster than we thought

632
00:12:01,009 --> 00:12:01,019
experience this faster than we thought
 

633
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:03,050
experience this faster than we thought
because we might be building another

634
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:03,060
because we might be building another
 

635
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,750
because we might be building another
another kind of intelligence yeah and

636
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:05,760
another kind of intelligence yeah and
 

637
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,550
another kind of intelligence yeah and
that that intelligence will explain to

638
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:07,560
that that intelligence will explain to
 

639
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,730
that that intelligence will explain to
us how silly we are there was an email

00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:06,889
oh this is the I mean and they still
didn't understand all the parts of it

742
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:06,899
didn't understand all the parts of it
 

743
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:08,930
didn't understand all the parts of it
but you know they basically got it it's

744
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:08,940
but you know they basically got it it's
 

745
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:12,410

like oh because of the because of the
understanding of these processes it's

748
00:14:14,329 --> 00:14:14,339
understanding of these processes it's
 

749
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:16,490
understanding of these processes it's
like we unveiled the reason that there

750
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:16,500
like we unveiled the reason that there
 

751
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,650
like we unveiled the reason that there
can be life in the universe that's

752
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:18,660
can be life in the universe that's
 

753
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,150

probably one of those days the universe

754
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:20,160
probably one of those days the universe
 

755
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,509

757
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,069
changed right yeah and uh remember 1930s
yeah it seems like technology is

758
00:14:25,069 --> 00:14:25,079
yeah it seems like technology is
 

759
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:28,009
yeah it seems like technology is
developing faster and faster and faster

760
00:14:28,009 --> 00:14:28,019
developing faster and faster and faster
 

761
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:30,230

I tend to think just like with your gbt

762
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:30,240
I tend to think just like with your gbt
 

763
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,970
I tend to think just like with your gbt
I think this year might be extremely

764
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:31,980
I think this year might be extremely
 

765
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:35,990
I think this year might be extremely
interesting just with how rapid and how

766
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:36,000
interesting just with how rapid and how
 

767
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,030
interesting just with how rapid and how
profitable the efforts and artificial

768
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:38,040
profitable the efforts and artificial
 

769
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,670
profitable the efforts and artificial
intelligence are that just stuff will

770
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:40,680
intelligence are that just stuff will
 

771
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,230
intelligence are that just stuff will
happen where our whole world is

772
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:42,240
happen where our whole world is
 

773
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,210
happen where our whole world is
transformed like this

774
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:44,220
transformed like this
 

775
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,610
transformed like this
and we're there's a shock and then next

776
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:46,620
and we're there's a shock and then next
 

777
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,050
and we're there's a shock and then next
day you kind of go on and you adjust

778
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:48,060
day you kind of go on and you adjust
 

779
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,870
day you kind of go on and you adjust
immediately uh you probably won't have a

780
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:50,880
immediately uh you probably won't have a
 

781
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,970
immediately uh you probably won't have a
similar kind of thing with uh nuclear

782
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:52,980
similar kind of thing with uh nuclear
 

783
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,470
similar kind of thing with uh nuclear
fusion with energy because there's

784
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:54,480
fusion with energy because there's
 

785
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,389
fusion with energy because there's
there's probably going to be an opening

786
00:14:56,389 --> 00:14:56,399
there's probably going to be an opening
 

787
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,910
there's probably going to be an opening
ceremony and stuff yes an announcement

788
00:14:58,910 --> 00:14:58,920
ceremony and stuff yes an announcement
 

789
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,009
ceremony and stuff yes an announcement
it'll take months but with uh with

790
00:15:01,009 --> 00:15:01,019
it'll take months but with uh with
 

791
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:02,990
it'll take months but with uh with
digital technology you can just have a

792
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:03,000
digital technology you can just have a
 

793
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,810
digital technology you can just have a
immediate transformation of society and

794
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:05,820
immediate transformation of society and
 

795
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,030
immediate transformation of society and
then it'll be this gasp and then you

796
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:08,040
then it'll be this gasp and then you
 

797
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,949
then it'll be this gasp and then you
kind of adjust like we always do and

798
00:15:09,949 --> 00:15:09,959
kind of adjust like we always do and
 

799
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:11,569
kind of adjust like we always do and
then you don't even remember just like

800
00:15:11,569 --> 00:15:11,579
then you don't even remember just like
 

801
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:13,310
then you don't even remember just like
with the internet and so on how the days

802
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:13,320
with the internet and so on how the days
 

803
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,110
with the internet and so on how the days
were before and how did it worked before

804
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:15,120
were before and how did it worked before
 

805
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,810
were before and how did it worked before
right yeah I mean Fusion will be because

806
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:17,820
right yeah I mean Fusion will be because
 

807
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:20,629
right yeah I mean Fusion will be because
it's energy it's it's nature is that it

808
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:20,639
it's energy it's it's nature is that it
 

809
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,310
it's energy it's it's nature is that it
will be um and anything that has to do

810
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:22,320
will be um and anything that has to do
 

811
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,990
will be um and anything that has to do
with energy use tends to be a slower

812
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:24,000
with energy use tends to be a slower
 

813
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,750
with energy use tends to be a slower
transition but they're the most I would

814
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:26,760
transition but they're the most I would
 

815
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,509
transition but they're the most I would
argue for some of the most profound

816
00:15:28,509 --> 00:15:28,519
argue for some of the most profound
 

817
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:30,829
argue for some of the most profound
transitions that we make I mean the

818
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:30,839
transitions that we make I mean the
 

819
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:34,129
transitions that we make I mean the
reason that we can live like this and

820
00:15:34,129 --> 00:15:34,139
reason that we can live like this and
 

821
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:35,629
reason that we can live like this and
sit in this building and have this

822
00:15:35,629 --> 00:15:35,639
sit in this building and have this
 

823
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:37,310
sit in this building and have this
podcast and people around the world is

824
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:37,320
podcast and people around the world is
 

825
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,949
podcast and people around the world is
is at its heart is energy use and it's

826
00:15:39,949 --> 00:15:39,959
is at its heart is energy use and it's
 

827
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:42,290
is at its heart is energy use and it's
intense energy use that came from the

828
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:42,300
intense energy use that came from the
 

829
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,790
intense energy use that came from the
evolution of starting to use intense

830
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:43,800
evolution of starting to use intense
 

831
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,290
evolution of starting to use intense
Energies at the beginning of the

832
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:45,300
Energies at the beginning of the
 

833
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,329
Energies at the beginning of the
Industrial Revolution up to now it's

834
00:15:47,329 --> 00:15:47,339
Industrial Revolution up to now it's
 

835
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:49,129
Industrial Revolution up to now it's
that it's like it's a Bedrock actually

836
00:15:49,129 --> 00:15:49,139
that it's like it's a Bedrock actually
 

837
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:51,889
that it's like it's a Bedrock actually
of all of these but it doesn't tend to

838
00:15:51,889 --> 00:15:51,899
of all of these but it doesn't tend to
 

839
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:54,650
of all of these but it doesn't tend to
come overnight yeah and some of the most

840
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:54,660
come overnight yeah and some of the most
 

841
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:55,850
come overnight yeah and some of the most
important some of the most amazing

842
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:55,860
important some of the most amazing
 

843
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,410
important some of the most amazing
Technologies one we don't notice because

844
00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:57,420
Technologies one we don't notice because
 

845
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,610
Technologies one we don't notice because
we take it for granted because it

846
00:15:58,610 --> 00:15:58,620
we take it for granted because it
 

847
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,670
we take it for granted because it
enables this whole thing yeah which is

848
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:01,680
enables this whole thing yeah which is
 

849
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,730
enables this whole thing yeah which is
energy which is amazing for how

850
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:04,740
energy which is amazing for how
 

851
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:07,430
energy which is amazing for how
fundamental it is to our society and way

852
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:07,440
fundamental it is to our society and way
 

853
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,030
fundamental it is to our society and way
of life is a very poorly understood

854
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:10,040
of life is a very poorly understood
 

855
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,949
of life is a very poorly understood
concept actually just even energy itself

856
00:16:12,949 --> 00:16:12,959
concept actually just even energy itself
 

857
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,949
concept actually just even energy itself
people confuse energy sources with

858
00:16:15,949 --> 00:16:15,959
people confuse energy sources with
 

859
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:17,870
people confuse energy sources with
energy storage with energy transmission

860
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:17,880
energy storage with energy transmission
 

861
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:21,189
energy storage with energy transmission
these are different physical phenomena

862
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:21,199
these are different physical phenomena
 

863
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,870
these are different physical phenomena
which are very important for so for

864
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:23,880
which are very important for so for
 

865
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,889
which are very important for so for
example

866
00:16:24,889 --> 00:16:24,899
example
 

867
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:26,990
example
you know you buy an electric car and you

868
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:27,000
you know you buy an electric car and you
 

869
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,990
you know you buy an electric car and you
go oh good I have an emission free car

870
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:30,000
go oh good I have an emission free car
 

871
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,949
go oh good I have an emission free car
and uh ah but it's like so so why do you

872
00:16:33,949 --> 00:16:33,959
and uh ah but it's like so so why do you
 

873
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:35,389
and uh ah but it's like so so why do you
say that well it's because if I draw the

874
00:16:35,389 --> 00:16:35,399
say that well it's because if I draw the
 

875
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:37,490
say that well it's because if I draw the
circle around the car I have electricity

876
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:37,500
circle around the car I have electricity
 

877
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,949
circle around the car I have electricity
and it doesn't emit any anything okay

878
00:16:39,949 --> 00:16:39,959
and it doesn't emit any anything okay
 

879
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:42,050
and it doesn't emit any anything okay
but you plug that into a grid where you

880
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:42,060
but you plug that into a grid where you
 

881
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,970
but you plug that into a grid where you
follow that wire back there could be a

882
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:43,980
follow that wire back there could be a
 

883
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,790
follow that wire back there could be a
coal power plant or a gas power plant at

884
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:46,800
coal power plant or a gas power plant at
 

885
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,370
coal power plant or a gas power plant at
the end of that oh really I mean so this

886
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:49,380
the end of that oh really I mean so this
 

887
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,410
the end of that oh really I mean so this
isn't like carbon free oh

888
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:51,420
isn't like carbon free oh
 

889
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,749
isn't like carbon free oh
and it's not their fault it's just you

890
00:16:53,749 --> 00:16:53,759
and it's not their fault it's just you
 

891
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,269
and it's not their fault it's just you
know they don't like the car isn't a

892
00:16:56,269 --> 00:16:56,279
know they don't like the car isn't a
 

893
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:58,189
know they don't like the car isn't a
source of energy the underlying source

894
00:16:58,189 --> 00:16:58,199
source of energy the underlying source
 

895
00:16:58,199 --> 00:17:00,230
source of energy the underlying source
of energy was the combustion of the fuel

896
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:00,240
of energy was the combustion of the fuel
 

897
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,449
of energy was the combustion of the fuel
back somewhere plus there's also a story

898
00:17:02,449 --> 00:17:02,459
back somewhere plus there's also a story
 

899
00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:05,809
back somewhere plus there's also a story
of how the raw materials are mined in

900
00:17:05,809 --> 00:17:05,819
of how the raw materials are mined in
 

901
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:08,929
of how the raw materials are mined in
which parts of the world uh with sort of

902
00:17:08,929 --> 00:17:08,939
which parts of the world uh with sort of
 

903
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:11,449
which parts of the world uh with sort of
basic respect or or deep disrespect of

904
00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:11,459
basic respect or or deep disrespect of
 

905
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:12,949
basic respect or or deep disrespect of
human rights that happens in that money

906
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:12,959
human rights that happens in that money
 

907
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,870
human rights that happens in that money
so the whole supply chain there's a

908
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:14,880
so the whole supply chain there's a
 

909
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,730
so the whole supply chain there's a
story there that's deeper than just the

910
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:16,740
story there that's deeper than just the
 

911
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,110
story there that's deeper than just the
particular electric car with a circle

912
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:18,120
particular electric car with a circle
 

913
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,909
particular electric car with a circle
around it in the physics or the science

914
00:17:19,909 --> 00:17:19,919
around it in the physics or the science
 

915
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,949
around it in the physics or the science
of it too is the energy use that it

916
00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:21,959
of it too is the energy use that it
 

917
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:23,750
of it too is the energy use that it
takes to do that digging up which is

918
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:23,760
takes to do that digging up which is
 

919
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,909
takes to do that digging up which is
also important and all that yeah anyway

920
00:17:25,909 --> 00:17:25,919
also important and all that yeah anyway
 

921
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,669
also important and all that yeah anyway
so yeah we wandered away from Fusion but

922
00:17:28,669 --> 00:17:28,679
so yeah we wandered away from Fusion but
 

923
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:30,830
so yeah we wandered away from Fusion but
yes it's beautiful but it's very

924
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:30,840
yes it's beautiful but it's very
 

925
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,630
yes it's beautiful but it's very
important actually to in the in the

926
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:32,640
important actually to in the in the
 

927
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,909
important actually to in the in the
context of this just because you know

928
00:17:34,909 --> 00:17:34,919
context of this just because you know
 

929
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:37,130
context of this just because you know
those of us who work in infusion and

930
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:37,140
those of us who work in infusion and
 

931
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,289
those of us who work in infusion and
these other kinds of

932
00:17:39,289 --> 00:17:39,299
these other kinds of
 

933
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:40,870
these other kinds of
um sort of disruptive Energy

934
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:40,880
um sort of disruptive Energy
 

935
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,909
um sort of disruptive Energy
Technologies it's it's interesting I do

936
00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:43,919
Technologies it's it's interesting I do
 

937
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:45,650
Technologies it's it's interesting I do
think about like what would it what is

938
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:45,660
think about like what would it what is
 

939
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,930
think about like what would it what is
it going to mean to society to have an

940
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:47,940
it going to mean to society to have an
 

941
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,630
it going to mean to society to have an
energy source that is like this that

942
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:50,640
energy source that is like this that
 

943
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,909
energy source that is like this that
would be like you know which has which

944
00:17:52,909 --> 00:17:52,919
would be like you know which has which
 

945
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:54,169
would be like you know which has which
is such completely different

946
00:17:54,169 --> 00:17:54,179
is such completely different
 

947
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:55,789
is such completely different
characteristics

948
00:17:55,789 --> 00:17:55,799
characteristics
 

949
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:58,310
characteristics
for example you know free unlimited

950
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:58,320
for example you know free unlimited
 

951
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,070
for example you know free unlimited
access to the fuel but it has technology

952
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:01,080
access to the fuel but it has technology
 

953
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,750
access to the fuel but it has technology
implications so what does this mean

954
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:02,760
implications so what does this mean
 

955
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,150
implications so what does this mean
geopolitically what does it mean for how

956
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:05,160
geopolitically what does it mean for how
 

957
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,250
geopolitically what does it mean for how
we how we distribute wealth within our

958
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:07,260
we how we distribute wealth within our
 

959
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,289
we how we distribute wealth within our
society it's

960
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:09,299
society it's
 

961
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:11,810
society it's
it's very difficult to know but probably

962
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:11,820
it's very difficult to know but probably
 

963
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,669
it's very difficult to know but probably
profound yeah we're gonna have to find

964
00:18:13,669 --> 00:18:13,679
profound yeah we're gonna have to find
 

965
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:17,029
profound yeah we're gonna have to find
another reason to start wars uh for

966
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:17,039
another reason to start wars uh for
 

967
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,610
another reason to start wars uh for
instead of resources we've done a pretty

968
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:19,620
instead of resources we've done a pretty
 

969
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,490
instead of resources we've done a pretty
good job of that over the course of our

970
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:22,500
good job of that over the course of our
 

971
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,830
good job of that over the course of our
histories yeah uh so we talked about the

972
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:24,840
histories yeah uh so we talked about the
 

973
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,289
histories yeah uh so we talked about the
forces of physics and again sticking to

974
00:18:27,289 --> 00:18:27,299
forces of physics and again sticking to
 

975
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:29,090
forces of physics and again sticking to
the philosophical before we get to the

976
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:29,100
the philosophical before we get to the
 

977
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,909
the philosophical before we get to the
specific technical stuff E equals MC

978
00:18:31,909 --> 00:18:31,919
specific technical stuff E equals MC
 

979
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,529
specific technical stuff E equals MC
squared you mentioned how amazing is

980
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:33,539
squared you mentioned how amazing is
 

981
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:35,690
squared you mentioned how amazing is
that to you that energy and mass are the

982
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:35,700
that to you that energy and mass are the
 

983
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:36,470
that to you that energy and mass are the
same

984
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:36,480
same
 

985
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,850
same
and what does that have to do in your

986
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:37,860
and what does that have to do in your
 

987
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,049
and what does that have to do in your
clear Fusion

988
00:18:39,049 --> 00:18:39,059
clear Fusion
 

989
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:40,730
clear Fusion
so it has to do with everything we do

990
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:40,740
so it has to do with everything we do
 

991
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:43,010
so it has to do with everything we do
it's the fact that energy and mass are

992
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:43,020
it's the fact that energy and mass are
 

993
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,510
it's the fact that energy and mass are
equivalent to each other they're just

994
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:44,520
equivalent to each other they're just
 

995
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,970
equivalent to each other they're just
the way we usually comment to it is that

996
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:46,980
the way we usually comment to it is that
 

997
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,529
the way we usually comment to it is that
they're Just Energy just in different

998
00:18:48,529 --> 00:18:48,539
they're Just Energy just in different
 

999
00:18:48,539 --> 00:18:51,289
they're Just Energy just in different
forms can you intuitively understand

1000
00:18:51,289 --> 00:18:51,299
forms can you intuitively understand
 

1001
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:57,710
forms can you intuitively understand
that yes but it takes a long time I

1002
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:57,720

 

1003
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,049

um having for all but usually often I've

1004
00:19:00,049 --> 00:19:00,059
um having for all but usually often I've
 

1005
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:03,650
um having for all but usually often I've
I teach the um the introductory class

1006
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:03,660
I teach the um the introductory class
 

1007
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:06,830
I teach the um the introductory class
for incoming nuclear engineers and and

1008
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:06,840
for incoming nuclear engineers and and
 

1009
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,750
for incoming nuclear engineers and and
so we put this up as an equation and we

1010
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:08,760
so we put this up as an equation and we
 

1011
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,890
so we put this up as an equation and we
go through many iterations of using this

1012
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:11,900
go through many iterations of using this
 

1013
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,990
go through many iterations of using this
uh to how you derive it how you use it

1014
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:15,000
uh to how you derive it how you use it
 

1015
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,750
uh to how you derive it how you use it
and so forth and then you usually in the

1016
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:17,760
and so forth and then you usually in the
 

1017
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,970
and so forth and then you usually in the
final exam I would give I would

1018
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:19,980
final exam I would give I would
 

1019
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,409
final exam I would give I would
basically take all the equations that

1020
00:19:21,409 --> 00:19:21,419
basically take all the equations that
 

1021
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:23,330
basically take all the equations that
I've used before and I flip it around I

1022
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:23,340
I've used before and I flip it around I
 

1023
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,190
I've used before and I flip it around I
basically instead of thinking about

1024
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:25,200
basically instead of thinking about
 

1025
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,710
basically instead of thinking about
energy is equal to mass is sort of mass

1026
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:27,720
energy is equal to mass is sort of mass
 

1027
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,330
energy is equal to mass is sort of mass
is equal to energy and I asked the

1028
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:29,340
is equal to energy and I asked the
 

1029
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,610
is equal to energy and I asked the
question in a different way and usually

1030
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:31,620
question in a different way and usually
 

1031
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,049
question in a different way and usually
about half the students don't get it it

1032
00:19:33,049 --> 00:19:33,059
about half the students don't get it it
 

1033
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:35,510
about half the students don't get it it
takes a while is to get that intuition

1034
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:35,520
takes a while is to get that intuition
 

1035
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,710
takes a while is to get that intuition
yeah

1036
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:36,720
yeah
 

1037
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,169
yeah
um so so in the end it's interesting is

1038
00:19:39,169 --> 00:19:39,179
um so so in the end it's interesting is
 

1039
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:41,390
um so so in the end it's interesting is
that this is is actually the source of

1040
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:41,400
that this is is actually the source of
 

1041
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,549
that this is is actually the source of
all free energy because that energy that

1042
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:43,559
all free energy because that energy that
 

1043
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:46,070
all free energy because that energy that
we're talking about is kinetic energy if

1044
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:46,080
we're talking about is kinetic energy if
 

1045
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,930
we're talking about is kinetic energy if
it can be transformed from Mass so it

1046
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:47,940
it can be transformed from Mass so it
 

1047
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,690
it can be transformed from Mass so it
turns out even even though we we used

1048
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:50,700
turns out even even though we we used
 

1049
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,150
turns out even even though we we used
equals MC square this is burning coal

1050
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:53,160
equals MC square this is burning coal
 

1051
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,210
equals MC square this is burning coal
and and burning gas are and burning wood

1052
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:56,220
and and burning gas are and burning wood
 

1053
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,909
and and burning gas are and burning wood
is actually still equals mc squared the

1054
00:19:58,909 --> 00:19:58,919
is actually still equals mc squared the
 

1055
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:00,350
is actually still equals mc squared the
problem is that you would never know

1056
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:00,360
problem is that you would never know
 

1057
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,210
problem is that you would never know
this because the relative change in the

1058
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:02,220
this because the relative change in the
 

1059
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,610
this because the relative change in the
mass is incredibly small by the way

1060
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:04,620
mass is incredibly small by the way
 

1061
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,070
mass is incredibly small by the way
which comes back to Fusion which is that

1062
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:07,080
which comes back to Fusion which is that
 

1063
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,110
which comes back to Fusion which is that
E equals m c squared okay so what does

1064
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:09,120
E equals m c squared okay so what does
 

1065
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,850
E equals m c squared okay so what does
this mean it tells you that the the

1066
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:10,860
this mean it tells you that the the
 

1067
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:13,610
this mean it tells you that the the
amount of energy that is liberated in a

1068
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:13,620
amount of energy that is liberated in a
 

1069
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,770
amount of energy that is liberated in a
particular reaction when you change Mass

1070
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:15,780
particular reaction when you change Mass
 

1071
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:18,529
particular reaction when you change Mass
has to because c squared is that's the

1072
00:20:18,529 --> 00:20:18,539
has to because c squared is that's the
 

1073
00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:19,669
has to because c squared is that's the
speed of light squared it's a large

1074
00:20:19,669 --> 00:20:19,679
speed of light squared it's a large
 

1075
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,350
speed of light squared it's a large
number it's a very large number and it's

1076
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:21,360
number it's a very large number and it's
 

1077
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,850
number it's a very large number and it's
totally constant everywhere in the

1078
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:22,860
totally constant everywhere in the
 

1079
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,350
totally constant everywhere in the
universe which is which is another weird

1080
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:24,360
universe which is which is another weird
 

1081
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,490
universe which is which is another weird
thing which is another weird thing and

1082
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:25,500
thing which is another weird thing and
 

1083
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,590
thing which is another weird thing and
in all rest frames and the actually the

1084
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:27,600
in all rest frames and the actually the
 

1085
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,049
in all rest frames and the actually the
relatively stuff gets more

1086
00:20:30,049 --> 00:20:30,059
relatively stuff gets more
 

1087
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:32,270
relatively stuff gets more
difficult conceptually even until you

1088
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:32,280
difficult conceptually even until you
 

1089
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,310
difficult conceptually even until you
get through it anyway so you go you go

1090
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:34,320
get through it anyway so you go you go
 

1091
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,950
get through it anyway so you go you go
to that and and it's in what that tells

1092
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:36,960
to that and and it's in what that tells
 

1093
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,990
to that and and it's in what that tells
you is that it's the relative it's the

1094
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:39,000
you is that it's the relative it's the
 

1095
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,730
you is that it's the relative it's the
relative change in the mass we'll tell

1096
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:40,740
relative change in the mass we'll tell
 

1097
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,110
relative change in the mass we'll tell
you about the relative amount of energy

1098
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:42,120
you about the relative amount of energy
 

1099
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,210
you about the relative amount of energy
that's liberated and this is what makes

1100
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:44,220
that's liberated and this is what makes
 

1101
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,950
that's liberated and this is what makes
fusion and you asked about Fusion as

1102
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:45,960
fusion and you asked about Fusion as
 

1103
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,810
fusion and you asked about Fusion as
well too this is what makes them

1104
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:47,820
well too this is what makes them
 

1105
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,270
well too this is what makes them
extraordinary it's because the relative

1106
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:50,280
extraordinary it's because the relative
 

1107
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,270
extraordinary it's because the relative
change in the mass is very large as

1108
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:53,280
change in the mass is very large as
 

1109
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,010
change in the mass is very large as
compared to what you get like in a

1110
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:55,020
compared to what you get like in a
 

1111
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,690
compared to what you get like in a
chemical reaction in fact it's about

1112
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:56,700
chemical reaction in fact it's about
 

1113
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:00,169
chemical reaction in fact it's about
it's about 10 million times larger

1114
00:21:00,169 --> 00:21:00,179
it's about 10 million times larger
 

1115
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:03,710
it's about 10 million times larger
and that is at the heart of why you use

1116
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:03,720
and that is at the heart of why you use
 

1117
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,470
and that is at the heart of why you use
something like Fusion it's because that

1118
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:06,480
something like Fusion it's because that
 

1119
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,990
something like Fusion it's because that
is a fundamental of nature like you

1120
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:09,000
is a fundamental of nature like you
 

1121
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,289
is a fundamental of nature like you
can't beat that so of whatever you do if

1122
00:21:12,289 --> 00:21:12,299
can't beat that so of whatever you do if
 

1123
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:14,029
can't beat that so of whatever you do if
you're thinking about and why do I care

1124
00:21:14,029 --> 00:21:14,039
you're thinking about and why do I care
 

1125
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:16,430
you're thinking about and why do I care
about this well because Mass is like the

1126
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:16,440
about this well because Mass is like the
 

1127
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,549
about this well because Mass is like the
fuel right so this means Gathering the

1128
00:21:19,549 --> 00:21:19,559
fuel right so this means Gathering the
 

1129
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:21,350
fuel right so this means Gathering the
resources that it takes to gather a fuel

1130
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:21,360
resources that it takes to gather a fuel
 

1131
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,169
resources that it takes to gather a fuel
to hold it together to deal with it the

1132
00:21:24,169 --> 00:21:24,179
to hold it together to deal with it the
 

1133
00:21:24,179 --> 00:21:26,690
to hold it together to deal with it the
environmental impact it would have and

1134
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:26,700
environmental impact it would have and
 

1135
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,149
environmental impact it would have and
fusion will always have 20 million times

1136
00:21:29,149 --> 00:21:29,159
fusion will always have 20 million times
 

1137
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:31,789
fusion will always have 20 million times
the amount of energy we lease per

1138
00:21:31,789 --> 00:21:31,799
the amount of energy we lease per
 

1139
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:33,830
the amount of energy we lease per
reaction that you could have those so

1140
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:33,840
reaction that you could have those so
 

1141
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,169
reaction that you could have those so
this is why you know we consider it the

1142
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:36,179
this is why you know we consider it the
 

1143
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:37,909
this is why you know we consider it the
ultimate like environmentally friendly

1144
00:21:37,909 --> 00:21:37,919
ultimate like environmentally friendly
 

1145
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,090
ultimate like environmentally friendly
energy source is because of that so is

1146
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:41,100
energy source is because of that so is
 

1147
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,310
energy source is because of that so is
it is it correct to think of mass

1148
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:43,320
it is it correct to think of mass
 

1149
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,710
it is it correct to think of mass
broadly as a kind of storage of energy

1150
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:45,720
broadly as a kind of storage of energy
 

1151
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,390
broadly as a kind of storage of energy
yes

1152
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:47,400
yes
 

1153
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,190
yes
you mentioned it's environmentally

1154
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:49,200
you mentioned it's environmentally
 

1155
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,690
you mentioned it's environmentally
friendly so

1156
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:50,700
friendly so
 

1157
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,549
friendly so
nuclear fusion is a source of energy

1158
00:21:52,549 --> 00:21:52,559
nuclear fusion is a source of energy
 

1159
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,029
nuclear fusion is a source of energy
it's cheap Clean safe so easy access to

1160
00:21:56,029 --> 00:21:56,039
it's cheap Clean safe so easy access to
 

1161
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:57,770
it's cheap Clean safe so easy access to

production of greenhouse gases little

1164
00:21:59,810 --> 00:21:59,820

00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:04,140
radioactive waste produced allegedly uh
 

1167
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:06,169
radioactive waste produced allegedly uh
can you can you sort of elaborate why

1168
00:22:06,169 --> 00:22:06,179
can you can you sort of elaborate why
 

1169
00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:08,149
can you can you sort of elaborate why
it's cheap clean and safe I'll start

1170
00:22:08,149 --> 00:22:08,159
it's cheap clean and safe I'll start
 

1171
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,250
it's cheap clean and safe I'll start
with the easiest one cheap it is not

1172
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:10,260
with the easiest one cheap it is not
 

1173
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,770
with the easiest one cheap it is not
cheap yet because it hasn't been made at

1174
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:12,780
cheap yet because it hasn't been made at
 

1175
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,750
cheap yet because it hasn't been made at
a commercial scale right flies when

1176
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:14,760
a commercial scale right flies when
 

1177
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,710
a commercial scale right flies when
you're having fun yes yeah yeah

1178
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:17,720
you're having fun yes yeah yeah
 

1179
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,270
you're having fun yes yeah yeah
but yes not yet but we'll talk about it

1180
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:20,280
but yes not yet but we'll talk about it
 

1181
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,950
but yes not yet but we'll talk about it
actually we'll we'll come back to that

1182
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:21,960
actually we'll we'll come back to that
 

1183
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:26,390
actually we'll we'll come back to that
because it it this is cheaper or or a

1184
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:26,400
because it it this is cheaper or or a
 

1185
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,770
because it it this is cheaper or or a
more technically correct term that is

1186
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:27,780
more technically correct term that is
 

1187
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,270
more technically correct term that is
economic that it's economically

1188
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:29,280
economic that it's economically
 

1189
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,330
economic that it's economically
interesting is is really the primary

1190
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:32,340
interesting is is really the primary
 

1191
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,490
interesting is is really the primary
challenge actually a fusion at this

1192
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:34,500
challenge actually a fusion at this
 

1193
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,690
challenge actually a fusion at this
point

1194
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:35,700
point
 

1195
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,130
point
um but really we can get back to that so

1196
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:37,140
um but really we can get back to that so
 

1197
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,750
um but really we can get back to that so
what were the other ones you said um so

1198
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:38,760
what were the other ones you said um so
 

1199
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,149
what were the other ones you said um so
cheap actually when we're talking about

1200
00:22:41,149 --> 00:22:41,159
cheap actually when we're talking about
 

1201
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:42,770
cheap actually when we're talking about
cheap we're thinking like asymptotically

1202
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:42,780
cheap we're thinking like asymptotically
 

1203
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:45,830
cheap we're thinking like asymptotically
like if you take it Forward yeah several

1204
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:45,840
like if you take it Forward yeah several
 

1205
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,250
like if you take it Forward yeah several
hundred years uh that's sort of because

1206
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:49,260
hundred years uh that's sort of because
 

1207
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:52,070
hundred years uh that's sort of because
of how much availability there is of

1208
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:52,080
of how much availability there is of
 

1209
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,930
of how much availability there is of
resources to use of the fuel you have

1210
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:53,940
resources to use of the fuel you have
 

1211
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,789
resources to use of the fuel you have
the fuel we should separate those two

1212
00:22:55,789 --> 00:22:55,799
the fuel we should separate those two
 

1213
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:57,890
the fuel we should separate those two
the fuel will all the fuel is already

1214
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:57,900
the fuel will all the fuel is already
 

1215
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,770
the fuel will all the fuel is already
cheap it's basically free right what do

1216
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:00,780
cheap it's basically free right what do
 

1217
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,990
cheap it's basically free right what do
you mean by basically free so if if we

1218
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:03,000
you mean by basically free so if if we
 

1219
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,090
you mean by basically free so if if we
were to be using fusion

1220
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:05,100
were to be using fusion
 

1221
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:08,570
were to be using fusion
um fuel sources to power your and it's

1222
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:08,580
um fuel sources to power your and it's
 

1223
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:10,010
um fuel sources to power your and it's
like that's all we have is fusion power

1224
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:10,020
like that's all we have is fusion power
 

1225
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,870
like that's all we have is fusion power
plants around and we were doing it the

1226
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:11,880
plants around and we were doing it the
 

1227
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,029
plants around and we were doing it the
fuel cost per person or something like

1228
00:23:14,029 --> 00:23:14,039
fuel cost per person or something like
 

1229
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:17,270
fuel cost per person or something like
10 cents a year it's like it's free okay

1230
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:17,280
10 cents a year it's like it's free okay
 

1231
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,669
10 cents a year it's like it's free okay
this is why it's hard to in some ways I

1232
00:23:19,669 --> 00:23:19,679
this is why it's hard to in some ways I
 

1233
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,590
this is why it's hard to in some ways I
think it's hard to understand Fusion

1234
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:21,600
think it's hard to understand Fusion
 

1235
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,930
think it's hard to understand Fusion
because people see this and go oh if the

1236
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:23,940
because people see this and go oh if the
 

1237
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,490
because people see this and go oh if the
fuel is free this means the energy

1238
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:25,500
fuel is free this means the energy
 

1239
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,770
fuel is free this means the energy
source is free because we're used to

1240
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:27,780
source is free because we're used to
 

1241
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:30,049
source is free because we're used to
energy sources like this so we you know

1242
00:23:30,049 --> 00:23:30,059
energy sources like this so we you know
 

1243
00:23:30,059 --> 00:23:33,049
energy sources like this so we you know
we spend resources and drill to get gas

1244
00:23:33,049 --> 00:23:33,059
we spend resources and drill to get gas
 

1245
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:35,990
we spend resources and drill to get gas
or oil or we chop wood or we make coal

1246
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:36,000
or oil or we chop wood or we make coal
 

1247
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,730
or oil or we chop wood or we make coal
we find coal or these things all right

1248
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:37,740
we find coal or these things all right
 

1249
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:40,970
we find coal or these things all right
so Fusion this is what makes fusion and

1250
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:40,980
so Fusion this is what makes fusion and
 

1251
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,529
so Fusion this is what makes fusion and
it's also

1252
00:23:42,529 --> 00:23:42,539
it's also
 

1253
00:23:42,539 --> 00:23:44,270
it's also
um it's not an intermittent renewable

1254
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:44,280
um it's not an intermittent renewable
 

1255
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,730
um it's not an intermittent renewable
energy source like wind and solar so say

1256
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:46,740
energy source like wind and solar so say
 

1257
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,289
energy source like wind and solar so say
but this is this makes it hard to

1258
00:23:48,289 --> 00:23:48,299
but this is this makes it hard to
 

1259
00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:49,730
but this is this makes it hard to
understand so as you're saying the fuel

1260
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:49,740
understand so as you're saying the fuel
 

1261
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:52,549
understand so as you're saying the fuel
is free why isn't the like why isn't the

1262
00:23:52,549 --> 00:23:52,559
is free why isn't the like why isn't the
 

1263
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,430
is free why isn't the like why isn't the
energy source free and it's because of

1264
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:55,440
energy source free and it's because of
 

1265
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,430
energy source free and it's because of
the necessary Technologies which must be

1266
00:23:58,430 --> 00:23:58,440
the necessary Technologies which must be
 

1267
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,130
the necessary Technologies which must be
applied to basically recreate the

1268
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:01,140
applied to basically recreate the
 

1269
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:04,190
applied to basically recreate the
conditions which are in stars in the

1270
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:04,200
conditions which are in stars in the
 

1271
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,049
conditions which are in stars in the
center of stars in fact so there's only

1272
00:24:06,049 --> 00:24:06,059
center of stars in fact so there's only
 

1273
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:08,149
center of stars in fact so there's only
one natural place in the universe that

1274
00:24:08,149 --> 00:24:08,159
one natural place in the universe that
 

1275
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,450
one natural place in the universe that
fusion fusion energy occurs that's in

1276
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:11,460
fusion fusion energy occurs that's in
 

1277
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,909
fusion fusion energy occurs that's in
the center of stars so that's going to

1278
00:24:13,909 --> 00:24:13,919
the center of stars so that's going to
 

1279
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,210
the center of stars so that's going to
bring a price to it depending on the the

1280
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:17,220
bring a price to it depending on the the
 

1281
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,549
bring a price to it depending on the the
cost and sorry the size and complexity

1282
00:24:19,549 --> 00:24:19,559
cost and sorry the size and complexity
 

1283
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:21,770
cost and sorry the size and complexity
of of the technology that's needed to

1284
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:21,780
of of the technology that's needed to
 

1285
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,270
of of the technology that's needed to
recreate those things and we'll talk

1286
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:23,280
recreate those things and we'll talk
 

1287
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,010
recreate those things and we'll talk
about the details of double Technologies

1288
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:25,020
about the details of double Technologies
 

1289
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,409
about the details of double Technologies
and which parts might be expensive today

1290
00:24:27,409 --> 00:24:27,419
and which parts might be expensive today
 

1291
00:24:27,419 --> 00:24:29,090
and which parts might be expensive today
and which parts might be expensive in

1292
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:29,100
and which parts might be expensive in
 

1293
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,850
and which parts might be expensive in
200 years exactly it will have a

1294
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:31,860
200 years exactly it will have a
 

1295
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:34,850
200 years exactly it will have a
revolution I'm certain of it um so about

1296
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:34,860
revolution I'm certain of it um so about
 

1297
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:38,149
revolution I'm certain of it um so about
clean so clean is at its heart what it

1298
00:24:38,149 --> 00:24:38,159
clean so clean is at its heart what it
 

1299
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,549
clean so clean is at its heart what it
does is convert it basically converts

1300
00:24:40,549 --> 00:24:40,559
does is convert it basically converts
 

1301
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,310
does is convert it basically converts
hydrogen into it's it's it's heavier

1302
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:43,320
hydrogen into it's it's it's heavier
 

1303
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,730
hydrogen into it's it's it's heavier
forms of hydrogen the one the most

1304
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:45,740
forms of hydrogen the one the most
 

1305
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:48,649
forms of hydrogen the one the most
predominant one that we use on Earth and

1306
00:24:48,649 --> 00:24:48,659
predominant one that we use on Earth and
 

1307
00:24:48,659 --> 00:24:51,230
predominant one that we use on Earth and
converts it into helium and some other

1308
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:51,240
converts it into helium and some other
 

1309
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,970
converts it into helium and some other
products but primarily helium is the

1310
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:52,980
products but primarily helium is the
 

1311
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,830
products but primarily helium is the
product that's left behind so helium

1312
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:54,840
product that's left behind so helium
 

1313
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:58,789
product that's left behind so helium
safe inert gas you know in fact that's

1314
00:24:58,789 --> 00:24:58,799
safe inert gas you know in fact that's
 

1315
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,110
safe inert gas you know in fact that's
actually what our sun is doing is

1316
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:00,120
actually what our sun is doing is
 

1317
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,610
actually what our sun is doing is
eventually going to extinguish itself

1318
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:01,620
eventually going to extinguish itself
 

1319
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,289
eventually going to extinguish itself
because it'll just make so much helium

1320
00:25:03,289 --> 00:25:03,299
because it'll just make so much helium
 

1321
00:25:03,299 --> 00:25:06,169
because it'll just make so much helium
that it doesn't it doesn't do that so in

1322
00:25:06,169 --> 00:25:06,179
that it doesn't it doesn't do that so in
 

1323
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:08,450
that it doesn't it doesn't do that so in
that sense clean because there's no

1324
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:08,460
that sense clean because there's no
 

1325
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:11,090
that sense clean because there's no
there's no emissions of of carbon or

1326
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:11,100
there's no emissions of of carbon or
 

1327
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,310
there's no emissions of of carbon or
pollutants that come directly from the

1328
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:13,320
pollutants that come directly from the
 

1329
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:16,610
pollutants that come directly from the
combustion of the fuel itself and safe

1330
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:16,620
combustion of the fuel itself and safe
 

1331
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,110
combustion of the fuel itself and safe
safe

1332
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:18,120
safe
 

1333
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,490
safe
we're talking about very high

1334
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:19,500
we're talking about very high
 

1335
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,710
we're talking about very high
temperatures yeah yeah so this is also

1336
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:21,720
temperatures yeah yeah so this is also
 

1337
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,810
temperatures yeah yeah so this is also
the counterintuitive thing so you I told

1338
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:23,820
the counterintuitive thing so you I told
 

1339
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,909
the counterintuitive thing so you I told
you temperatures which like 50 million

1340
00:25:25,909 --> 00:25:25,919
you temperatures which like 50 million
 

1341
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:27,950
you temperatures which like 50 million
degrees or it actually tends to be more

1342
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:27,960
degrees or it actually tends to be more
 

1343
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,810
degrees or it actually tends to be more
like about 100 million degrees is really

1344
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:29,820
like about 100 million degrees is really
 

1345
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,450
like about 100 million degrees is really
what we aim for so how can 100 million

1346
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:32,460
what we aim for so how can 100 million
 

1347
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:36,049
what we aim for so how can 100 million
degrees be safe and it's safe because it

1348
00:25:36,049 --> 00:25:36,059
degrees be safe and it's safe because it
 

1349
00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:36,769
degrees be safe and it's safe because it
is

1350
00:25:36,769 --> 00:25:36,779
is
 

1351
00:25:36,779 --> 00:25:40,190
is
this is so much hotter than anything on

1352
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:40,200
this is so much hotter than anything on
 

1353
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,930
this is so much hotter than anything on
Earth where everything on Earth is at

1354
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:41,940
Earth where everything on Earth is at
 

1355
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:44,210
Earth where everything on Earth is at
around 300 Kelvin you know it's around a

1356
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:44,220
around 300 Kelvin you know it's around a
 

1357
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,250
around 300 Kelvin you know it's around a
few tens of degrees Celsius

1358
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:46,260
few tens of degrees Celsius
 

1359
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:49,549
few tens of degrees Celsius
and what this means is that in order to

1360
00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:49,559
and what this means is that in order to
 

1361
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:52,250
and what this means is that in order to
get a medium to those temperatures you

1362
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:52,260
get a medium to those temperatures you
 

1363
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,289
get a medium to those temperatures you
have to completely isolate it from

1364
00:25:54,289 --> 00:25:54,299
have to completely isolate it from
 

1365
00:25:54,299 --> 00:25:55,850
have to completely isolate it from
anything to do with terrestrial

1366
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:55,860
anything to do with terrestrial
 

1367
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:58,549
anything to do with terrestrial
environment it can have no contact like

1368
00:25:58,549 --> 00:25:58,559
environment it can have no contact like
 

1369
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:01,190
environment it can have no contact like
with anything on Earth basically so this

1370
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:01,200
with anything on Earth basically so this
 

1371
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,710
with anything on Earth basically so this
means what we this is the technology

1372
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:03,720
means what we this is the technology
 

1373
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,330
means what we this is the technology
that I just described is it

1374
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:05,340
that I just described is it
 

1375
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:07,370
that I just described is it
fundamentally what it does is it takes

1376
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:07,380
fundamentally what it does is it takes
 

1377
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:10,789
fundamentally what it does is it takes
this Fuel and uh it isolates it from any

1378
00:26:10,789 --> 00:26:10,799
this Fuel and uh it isolates it from any
 

1379
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,710
this Fuel and uh it isolates it from any
terrestrial condition so that it has no

1380
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:12,720
terrestrial condition so that it has no
 

1381
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,570
terrestrial condition so that it has no
idea it's on Earth it's not touching any

1382
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:14,580
idea it's on Earth it's not touching any
 

1383
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,430
idea it's on Earth it's not touching any
object that that's at room temperature

1384
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:16,440
object that that's at room temperature
 

1385
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,590
object that that's at room temperature
including the walls of the containment

1386
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:18,600
including the walls of the containment
 

1387
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,390
including the walls of the containment
even including the walls of the

1388
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:20,400
even including the walls of the
 

1389
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,250
even including the walls of the
containment building or containment

1390
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:22,260
containment building or containment
 

1391
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:24,769
containment building or containment
device or even air or anything like this

1392
00:26:24,769 --> 00:26:24,779
device or even air or anything like this
 

1393
00:26:24,779 --> 00:26:27,830
device or even air or anything like this
so so it's that part

1394
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:27,840
so so it's that part
 

1395
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,049
so so it's that part
um that makes it safe in this and

1396
00:26:30,049 --> 00:26:30,059
um that makes it safe in this and
 

1397
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:31,549
um that makes it safe in this and
there's there's actually another aspect

1398
00:26:31,549 --> 00:26:31,559
there's there's actually another aspect
 

1399
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:33,890
there's there's actually another aspect
to it but that that fundamental part

1400
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:33,900
to it but that that fundamental part
 

1401
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,870
to it but that that fundamental part
makes it so safe

1402
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:35,880
makes it so safe
 

1403
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,350
makes it so safe
um in in the main lines

1404
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:38,360
um in in the main lines
 

1405
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,850
um in in the main lines
approach diffusion is also that it's

1406
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:40,860
approach diffusion is also that it's
 

1407
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:43,730
approach diffusion is also that it's
very hot but there's very very few

1408
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:43,740
very hot but there's very very few
 

1409
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:44,990
very hot but there's very very few
particles

1410
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:45,000
particles
 

1411
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,570
particles
in at any time in in the thing that we

1412
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:47,580
in at any time in in the thing that we
 

1413
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,310
in at any time in in the thing that we
view the power plant and the actually

1414
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:49,320
view the power plant and the actually
 

1415
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,930
view the power plant and the actually
the more correct way to do it is you say

1416
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:50,940
the more correct way to do it is you say
 

1417
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,870
the more correct way to do it is you say
there's very few particles per unit

1418
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:53,880
there's very few particles per unit
 

1419
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,090
there's very few particles per unit
volume so in a cubic centimeter and

1420
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:56,100
volume so in a cubic centimeter and
 

1421
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,470
volume so in a cubic centimeter and
cubic meter or something so we can do

1422
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:57,480
cubic meter or something so we can do
 

1423
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,570
cubic meter or something so we can do
this so right now we're although we

1424
00:26:59,570 --> 00:26:59,580
this so right now we're although we
 

1425
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,610
this so right now we're although we
don't think of air really as there's

1426
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:01,620
don't think of air really as there's
 

1427
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,409
don't think of air really as there's
atoms floating around us and there's a

1428
00:27:03,409 --> 00:27:03,419
atoms floating around us and there's a
 

1429
00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:05,990
atoms floating around us and there's a
density because if I wave my hand I can

1430
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:06,000
density because if I wave my hand I can
 

1431
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,850
density because if I wave my hand I can
feel the air pushing against my face

1432
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:07,860
feel the air pushing against my face
 

1433
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:10,130
feel the air pushing against my face
that means we're in a fluid or a gas

1434
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:10,140
that means we're in a fluid or a gas
 

1435
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:12,789
that means we're in a fluid or a gas
which is around us that has a particular

1436
00:27:12,789 --> 00:27:12,799
which is around us that has a particular
 

1437
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:17,090
which is around us that has a particular
number of atoms per cubic meter right so

1438
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:17,100
number of atoms per cubic meter right so
 

1439
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,769
number of atoms per cubic meter right so
it's about this actually turns out to be

1440
00:27:18,769 --> 00:27:18,779
it's about this actually turns out to be
 

1441
00:27:18,779 --> 00:27:21,409
it's about this actually turns out to be
10 to the 25th so this is one with 25

1442
00:27:21,409 --> 00:27:21,419
10 to the 25th so this is one with 25
 

1443
00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:24,350
10 to the 25th so this is one with 25
zeros behind it per cubic meter so we

1444
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:24,360
zeros behind it per cubic meter so we
 

1445
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,090
zeros behind it per cubic meter so we
can figure out like cubic like cubic

1446
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:26,100
can figure out like cubic like cubic
 

1447
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,950
can figure out like cubic like cubic
meters about like this yeah the volume

1448
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:27,960
meters about like this yeah the volume
 

1449
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,590
meters about like this yeah the volume
of this table like the whole volume

1450
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:30,600
of this table like the whole volume
 

1451
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,470
of this table like the whole volume
um okay very good so like Fusion there's

1452
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:33,480
um okay very good so like Fusion there's
 

1453
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,930
um okay very good so like Fusion there's
a few of those so Fusion like the

1454
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:35,940
a few of those so Fusion like the
 

1455
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,549
a few of those so Fusion like the
mainstream one of fusion like what we're

1456
00:27:37,549 --> 00:27:37,559
mainstream one of fusion like what we're
 

1457
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:39,769
mainstream one of fusion like what we're
working on at MIT will have a hundred

1458
00:27:39,769 --> 00:27:39,779
working on at MIT will have a hundred
 

1459
00:27:39,779 --> 00:27:42,370
working on at MIT will have a hundred
thousand times less particles

1460
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:42,380
thousand times less particles
 

1461
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:45,830
thousand times less particles
per unit volume than that so this is

1462
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:45,840
per unit volume than that so this is
 

1463
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,390
per unit volume than that so this is
very interesting because it's

1464
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:47,400
very interesting because it's
 

1465
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,370
very interesting because it's
extraordinarily Hot 100 million degrees

1466
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:49,380
extraordinarily Hot 100 million degrees
 

1467
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:52,250
extraordinarily Hot 100 million degrees
but it's very tenuous

1468
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:52,260
but it's very tenuous
 

1469
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,990
but it's very tenuous
and what matters from the engineering

1470
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:54,000
and what matters from the engineering
 

1471
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,690
and what matters from the engineering
and safety point of view is the amount

1472
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:56,700
and safety point of view is the amount
 

1473
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,570
and safety point of view is the amount
of energy which is stored per unit

1474
00:27:59,570 --> 00:27:59,580
of energy which is stored per unit
 

1475
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:02,450
of energy which is stored per unit
volume because this tells you about the

1476
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:02,460
volume because this tells you about the
 

1477
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:05,330
volume because this tells you about the
the scenarios and that's what you worry

1478
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:05,340
the scenarios and that's what you worry
 

1479
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,010
the scenarios and that's what you worry
about because when those kinds of

1480
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:07,020
about because when those kinds of
 

1481
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,470
about because when those kinds of
energies are released Suddenly It's like

1482
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:09,480
energies are released Suddenly It's like
 

1483
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,810
energies are released Suddenly It's like
what would be the consequences right so

1484
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:11,820
what would be the consequences right so
 

1485
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,789
what would be the consequences right so
the consequences of this are essentially

1486
00:28:13,789 --> 00:28:13,799
the consequences of this are essentially
 

1487
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:17,450
the consequences of this are essentially
zero because that's less energy content

1488
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:17,460
zero because that's less energy content
 

1489
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,850
zero because that's less energy content
than boiling water

1490
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:19,860
than boiling water
 

1491
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:22,310
than boiling water
because of the low density because of

1492
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:22,320
because of the low density because of
 

1493
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,370
because of the low density because of
the low density so if you take water is

1494
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:25,380
the low density so if you take water is
 

1495
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,710
the low density so if you take water is
at about 100 million to a billion times

1496
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:27,720
at about 100 million to a billion times
 

1497
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:30,710
at about 100 million to a billion times
more dense than this so even though it's

1498
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:30,720
more dense than this so even though it's
 

1499
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,769
more dense than this so even though it's
at much lower temperature it's actually

1500
00:28:33,769 --> 00:28:33,779
at much lower temperature it's actually
 

1501
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:36,470
at much lower temperature it's actually
still it has more energy content so if

1502
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:36,480
still it has more energy content so if
 

1503
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,210
still it has more energy content so if
for this reason

1504
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:38,220
for this reason
 

1505
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,470
for this reason
um you know one of the ways that I

1506
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:39,480
um you know one of the ways that I
 

1507
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,149
um you know one of the ways that I
explain this is that if you imagine a

1508
00:28:41,149 --> 00:28:41,159
explain this is that if you imagine a
 

1509
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:42,710
explain this is that if you imagine a
power plant that's like powering

1510
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:42,720
power plant that's like powering
 

1511
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,529
power plant that's like powering
Cambridge Massachusetts like if you were

1512
00:28:45,529 --> 00:28:45,539
Cambridge Massachusetts like if you were
 

1513
00:28:45,539 --> 00:28:46,850
Cambridge Massachusetts like if you were
to which you you wouldn't do this

1514
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:46,860
to which you you wouldn't do this
 

1515
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:49,370
to which you you wouldn't do this
directly but if you went like this on it

1516
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:49,380
directly but if you went like this on it
 

1517
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,890
directly but if you went like this on it
it actually extinguishes the fusion

1518
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:51,900
it actually extinguishes the fusion
 

1519
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:55,490
it actually extinguishes the fusion
because it gets too cold immediately

1520
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:55,500
because it gets too cold immediately
 

1521
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,890
because it gets too cold immediately
yeah so that's the other one and the

1522
00:28:57,890 --> 00:28:57,900
yeah so that's the other one and the
 

1523
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,269
yeah so that's the other one and the
other part is that it does not and

1524
00:28:59,269 --> 00:28:59,279
other part is that it does not and
 

1525
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,750
other part is that it does not and
because it works by staying hot rather

1526
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:02,760
because it works by staying hot rather
 

1527
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,549
because it works by staying hot rather
than a chain reaction it can't run out

1528
00:29:04,549 --> 00:29:04,559
than a chain reaction it can't run out
 

1529
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,230
than a chain reaction it can't run out
of control that's the other part of it

1530
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:06,240
of control that's the other part of it
 

1531
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,690
of control that's the other part of it
so by the way this is what very much

1532
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:08,700
so by the way this is what very much
 

1533
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,789
so by the way this is what very much
distinguishes it from fission it's not a

1534
00:29:10,789 --> 00:29:10,799
distinguishes it from fission it's not a
 

1535
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,289
distinguishes it from fission it's not a
process that can run away from you

1536
00:29:12,289 --> 00:29:12,299
process that can run away from you
 

1537
00:29:12,299 --> 00:29:14,029
process that can run away from you
because it's it's basically thermally

1538
00:29:14,029 --> 00:29:14,039
because it's it's basically thermally
 

1539
00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:15,049
because it's it's basically thermally
stable

1540
00:29:15,049 --> 00:29:15,059
stable
 

1541
00:29:15,059 --> 00:29:16,909
stable
what does thermostable mean that means

1542
00:29:16,909 --> 00:29:16,919
what does thermostable mean that means
 

1543
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:18,590
what does thermostable mean that means
is that you want to run it at the

1544
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:18,600
is that you want to run it at the
 

1545
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,169
is that you want to run it at the
optimization in temperature such that if

1546
00:29:21,169 --> 00:29:21,179
optimization in temperature such that if
 

1547
00:29:21,179 --> 00:29:22,610
optimization in temperature such that if
it deviates away from that temperature

1548
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:22,620
it deviates away from that temperature
 

1549
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:25,610
it deviates away from that temperature
the reactivity gets lower and and the

1550
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:25,620
the reactivity gets lower and and the
 

1551
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,230
the reactivity gets lower and and the
reason for this is because it's hard to

1552
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:27,240
reason for this is because it's hard to
 

1553
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,269
reason for this is because it's hard to
keep the reactivity going like it's a

1554
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:29,279
keep the reactivity going like it's a
 

1555
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,370
keep the reactivity going like it's a
very hard fire to keep going basically

1556
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:31,380
very hard fire to keep going basically
 

1557
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:33,169
very hard fire to keep going basically
also it doesn't it doesn't run away from

1558
00:29:33,169 --> 00:29:33,179
also it doesn't it doesn't run away from
 

1559
00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:35,330
also it doesn't it doesn't run away from
you it can't run away how difficult is

1560
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:35,340
you it can't run away how difficult is
 

1561
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,610
you it can't run away how difficult is
the control there to keep it at that it

1562
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:37,620
the control there to keep it at that it
 

1563
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:40,070
the control there to keep it at that it
varies from from concept to concept but

1564
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:40,080
varies from from concept to concept but
 

1565
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,990
varies from from concept to concept but
in generally it's fairly it's fairly

1566
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:42,000
in generally it's fairly it's fairly
 

1567
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,230
in generally it's fairly it's fairly
easy to do that and the easiest thing it

1568
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:45,240
easy to do that and the easiest thing it
 

1569
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,149
easy to do that and the easiest thing it
can't it can't physically run away from

1570
00:29:47,149 --> 00:29:47,159
can't it can't physically run away from
 

1571
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:48,769
can't it can't physically run away from
you because the other part of it is that

1572
00:29:48,769 --> 00:29:48,779
you because the other part of it is that
 

1573
00:29:48,779 --> 00:29:51,049
you because the other part of it is that
there's just at any given time there's a

1574
00:29:51,049 --> 00:29:51,059
there's just at any given time there's a
 

1575
00:29:51,059 --> 00:29:53,570
there's just at any given time there's a
very very small amount of fuel available

1576
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:53,580
very very small amount of fuel available
 

1577
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:57,289
very very small amount of fuel available
to fuse anyway so this means that that's

1578
00:29:57,289 --> 00:29:57,299
to fuse anyway so this means that that's
 

1579
00:29:57,299 --> 00:29:59,269
to fuse anyway so this means that that's
always intrinsically limited to this so

1580
00:29:59,269 --> 00:29:59,279
always intrinsically limited to this so
 

1581
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,789
always intrinsically limited to this so
if it even if the power consumption of

1582
00:30:01,789 --> 00:30:01,799
if it even if the power consumption of
 

1583
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:03,889
if it even if the power consumption of
the device goes up it just kind of burns

1584
00:30:03,889 --> 00:30:03,899
the device goes up it just kind of burns
 

1585
00:30:03,899 --> 00:30:06,289
the device goes up it just kind of burns
itself out immediately yeah so you are

1586
00:30:06,289 --> 00:30:06,299
itself out immediately yeah so you are
 

1587
00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:08,330
itself out immediately yeah so you are
the just to take a tan another tangent

1588
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:08,340
the just to take a tan another tangent
 

1589
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,130
the just to take a tan another tangent
on tangent you're the director of mit's

1590
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:10,140
on tangent you're the director of mit's
 

1591
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:13,250
on tangent you're the director of mit's
plasma science at Fusion Center uh

1592
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:13,260
plasma science at Fusion Center uh
 

1593
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:15,350
plasma science at Fusion Center uh
we'll talk about maybe you can mention

1594
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:15,360
we'll talk about maybe you can mention
 

1595
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,850
we'll talk about maybe you can mention
some interesting aspects of the history

1596
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:16,860
some interesting aspects of the history
 

1597
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:20,930
some interesting aspects of the history
of the center in the broader history

1598
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:20,940
of the center in the broader history
 

1599
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:23,870
of the center in the broader history
of uh MIT maybe brought a history of

1600
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:23,880
of uh MIT maybe brought a history of
 

1601
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,190
of uh MIT maybe brought a history of
Science and Engineering in the history

1602
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:25,200
Science and Engineering in the history
 

1603
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,070
Science and Engineering in the history
of human civilization but also just the

1604
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:28,080
of human civilization but also just the
 

1605
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,830
of human civilization but also just the
link on the safety aspect you know

1606
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:30,840
link on the safety aspect you know
 

1607
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,630
link on the safety aspect you know
um

1608
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:32,640
um
 

1609
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,810
um
how do you prevent you know some of the

1610
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:35,820
how do you prevent you know some of the
 

1611
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:38,990
how do you prevent you know some of the
amazing reactors that you're designing

1612
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:39,000
amazing reactors that you're designing
 

1613
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,730
amazing reactors that you're designing
how do you prevent from destroying all

1614
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:40,740
how do you prevent from destroying all
 

1615
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,430
how do you prevent from destroying all
of human civilization in the process

1616
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:42,440
of human civilization in the process
 

1617
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:46,310
of human civilization in the process
what's the safety protocols Fusion is

1618
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:46,320
what's the safety protocols Fusion is
 

1619
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,810
what's the safety protocols Fusion is
um interesting because it's not really

1620
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:47,820
um interesting because it's not really
 

1621
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:50,810
um interesting because it's not really
directly weaponizable because what I

1622
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:50,820
directly weaponizable because what I
 

1623
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,549
directly weaponizable because what I
mean by that is that you have you have

1624
00:30:52,549 --> 00:30:52,559
mean by that is that you have you have
 

1625
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,769
mean by that is that you have you have
to work very hard to make these

1626
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:54,779
to work very hard to make these
 

1627
00:30:54,779 --> 00:30:57,169
to work very hard to make these
conditions and which you can get energy

1628
00:30:57,169 --> 00:30:57,179
conditions and which you can get energy
 

1629
00:30:57,179 --> 00:30:59,810
conditions and which you can get energy
gain from from fusion

1630
00:30:59,810 --> 00:30:59,820
gain from from fusion
 

1631
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:02,810
gain from from fusion
um and uh this means that the the when

1632
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:02,820
um and uh this means that the the when
 

1633
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:05,389
um and uh this means that the the when
we design these devices with respect to

1634
00:31:05,389 --> 00:31:05,399
we design these devices with respect to
 

1635
00:31:05,399 --> 00:31:08,510
we design these devices with respect to
application in the energy field is that

1636
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:08,520
application in the energy field is that
 

1637
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,789
application in the energy field is that
they you know you

1638
00:31:10,789 --> 00:31:10,799
they you know you
 

1639
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:13,850
they you know you
the while while they will because

1640
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:13,860
the while while they will because
 

1641
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,590
the while while they will because
they're producing large amounts of power

1642
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:15,600
they're producing large amounts of power
 

1643
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,450
they're producing large amounts of power
and they will have hot things inside of

1644
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:17,460
and they will have hot things inside of
 

1645
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,190
and they will have hot things inside of
them this means that they have like a

1646
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:19,200
them this means that they have like a
 

1647
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,350
them this means that they have like a
level of industrial Hazard which is very

1648
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:21,360
level of industrial Hazard which is very
 

1649
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,210
level of industrial Hazard which is very
similar to like you would have like in a

1650
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:23,220
similar to like you would have like in a
 

1651
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:25,310
similar to like you would have like in a
chemical processing plant or anything

1652
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:25,320
chemical processing plant or anything
 

1653
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,990
chemical processing plant or anything
like that any kind of energy plant

1654
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:27,000
like that any kind of energy plant
 

1655
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,210
like that any kind of energy plant
actually has these as well too

1656
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:29,220
actually has these as well too
 

1657
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,370
actually has these as well too
but the underlying under underneath the

1658
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:31,380
but the underlying under underneath the
 

1659
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:34,269
but the underlying under underneath the
core technology like can't be directly

1660
00:31:34,269 --> 00:31:34,279
core technology like can't be directly
 

1661
00:31:34,279 --> 00:31:37,789
core technology like can't be directly
used uh in in a nefarious way because of

1662
00:31:37,789 --> 00:31:37,799
used uh in in a nefarious way because of
 

1663
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:39,649
used uh in in a nefarious way because of
the power that's being emitted it just

1664
00:31:39,649 --> 00:31:39,659
the power that's being emitted it just
 

1665
00:31:39,659 --> 00:31:41,930
the power that's being emitted it just
basically will if you try to do those

1666
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:41,940
basically will if you try to do those
 

1667
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,370
basically will if you try to do those
things typically it just stops working

1668
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:43,380
things typically it just stops working
 

1669
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:45,230
things typically it just stops working
so the safety concerns have to do with

1670
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:45,240
so the safety concerns have to do with
 

1671
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,269
so the safety concerns have to do with
just regular things that uh like

1672
00:31:47,269 --> 00:31:47,279
just regular things that uh like
 

1673
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,029
just regular things that uh like
equipment malfunctioning

1674
00:31:49,029 --> 00:31:49,039
equipment malfunctioning
 

1675
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:52,490
equipment malfunctioning
uh melting of equip like all this kind

1676
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:52,500
uh melting of equip like all this kind
 

1677
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,810
uh melting of equip like all this kind
of stuff that yeah it has nothing to do

1678
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:53,820
of stuff that yeah it has nothing to do
 

1679
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,370
of stuff that yeah it has nothing to do
with Fusion necessarily yeah I mean

1680
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:55,380
with Fusion necessarily yeah I mean
 

1681
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,169
with Fusion necessarily yeah I mean
usually what we worry about is the

1682
00:31:57,169 --> 00:31:57,179
usually what we worry about is the
 

1683
00:31:57,179 --> 00:31:59,210
usually what we worry about is the
viability because in the end we build

1684
00:31:59,210 --> 00:31:59,220
viability because in the end we build
 

1685
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:02,810
viability because in the end we build
pretty complex objects to realize these

1686
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:02,820
pretty complex objects to realize these
 

1687
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:05,149
pretty complex objects to realize these
requirements and so what we try really

1688
00:32:05,149 --> 00:32:05,159
requirements and so what we try really
 

1689
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:07,010
requirements and so what we try really
hard to do is like not damage those

1690
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:07,020
hard to do is like not damage those
 

1691
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,630
hard to do is like not damage those
components which but those are things

1692
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:08,640
components which but those are things
 

1693
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,210
components which but those are things
which are internal to the to the fusion

1694
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:11,220
which are internal to the to the fusion
 

1695
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,130
which are internal to the to the fusion
device and and it's this is not

1696
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:13,140
device and and it's this is not
 

1697
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,110
device and and it's this is not
something that you would

1698
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:15,120
something that you would
 

1699
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,510
something that you would
um consider about like it would as you

1700
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:17,520
um consider about like it would as you
 

1701
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,310
um consider about like it would as you
say destroy human civilization because

1702
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:19,320
say destroy human civilization because
 

1703
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,110
say destroy human civilization because
that release of energy is just

1704
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:21,120
that release of energy is just
 

1705
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,970
that release of energy is just
inherently limited because of the fusion

1706
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:22,980
inherently limited because of the fusion
 

1707
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,769
inherently limited because of the fusion
process so it doesn't say that there's

1708
00:32:24,769 --> 00:32:24,779
process so it doesn't say that there's
 

1709
00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:26,570
process so it doesn't say that there's
zero so you asked about the other

1710
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:26,580
zero so you asked about the other
 

1711
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,909
zero so you asked about the other
feature for that it's safe so it is the

1712
00:32:28,909 --> 00:32:28,919
feature for that it's safe so it is the
 

1713
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:30,950
feature for that it's safe so it is the
process process itself is intrinsically

1714
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:30,960
process process itself is intrinsically
 

1715
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,230
process process itself is intrinsically
safe but because it's a complex

1716
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:33,240
safe but because it's a complex
 

1717
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,970
safe but because it's a complex
technology you still have to take into

1718
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:34,980
technology you still have to take into
 

1719
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:37,190
technology you still have to take into
account consideration aspects of the

1720
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:37,200
account consideration aspects of the
 

1721
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,269
account consideration aspects of the
safety so it produces ionizing radiation

1722
00:32:40,269 --> 00:32:40,279
safety so it produces ionizing radiation
 

1723
00:32:40,279 --> 00:32:42,590
safety so it produces ionizing radiation
instantaneously so you have to take care

1724
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:42,600
instantaneously so you have to take care
 

1725
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,269
instantaneously so you have to take care
of this which means that you Shield it

1726
00:32:44,269 --> 00:32:44,279
of this which means that you Shield it
 

1727
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:46,730
of this which means that you Shield it
you think of like your dental X-rays or

1728
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:46,740
you think of like your dental X-rays or
 

1729
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,529
you think of like your dental X-rays or
or treatments for cancer and things like

1730
00:32:48,529 --> 00:32:48,539
or treatments for cancer and things like
 

1731
00:32:48,539 --> 00:32:50,389
or treatments for cancer and things like
this we we always Shield ourselves from

1732
00:32:50,389 --> 00:32:50,399
this we we always Shield ourselves from
 

1733
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:52,430
this we we always Shield ourselves from
this so we get the beneficial effects

1734
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:52,440
this so we get the beneficial effects
 

1735
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,169
this so we get the beneficial effects
but we minimize the harmful effects of

1736
00:32:54,169 --> 00:32:54,179
but we minimize the harmful effects of
 

1737
00:32:54,179 --> 00:32:56,690
but we minimize the harmful effects of
those so there are those aspects of it

1738
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:56,700
those so there are those aspects of it
 

1739
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:59,149
those so there are those aspects of it
as well too yeah so we'll return to

1740
00:32:59,149 --> 00:32:59,159
as well too yeah so we'll return to
 

1741
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:01,250
as well too yeah so we'll return to
mit's plasma science the future Center

1742
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:01,260
mit's plasma science the future Center
 

1743
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:03,529
mit's plasma science the future Center
but let us Linger on the uh destruction

1744
00:33:03,529 --> 00:33:03,539
but let us Linger on the uh destruction
 

1745
00:33:03,539 --> 00:33:05,990
but let us Linger on the uh destruction
of human civilization uh which brings us

1746
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:06,000
of human civilization uh which brings us
 

1747
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,269
of human civilization uh which brings us
to the topic of nuclear fission what is

1748
00:33:08,269 --> 00:33:08,279
to the topic of nuclear fission what is
 

1749
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:12,070
to the topic of nuclear fission what is
that so the the process that is inside

1750
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:12,080
that so the the process that is inside
 

1751
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,049
that so the the process that is inside
nuclear weapons and current nuclear

1752
00:33:15,049 --> 00:33:15,059
nuclear weapons and current nuclear
 

1753
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:18,409
nuclear weapons and current nuclear
power plants so it relies on the same

1754
00:33:18,409 --> 00:33:18,419
power plants so it relies on the same
 

1755
00:33:18,419 --> 00:33:20,990
power plants so it relies on the same
underlying physical principle but it's

1756
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:21,000
underlying physical principle but it's
 

1757
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,330
underlying physical principle but it's
exactly the opposite a few which

1758
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:23,340
exactly the opposite a few which
 

1759
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:25,610
exactly the opposite a few which
actually the names imply Fusion means

1760
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:25,620
actually the names imply Fusion means
 

1761
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:27,409
actually the names imply Fusion means
bringing things together fission means

1762
00:33:27,409 --> 00:33:27,419
bringing things together fission means
 

1763
00:33:27,419 --> 00:33:30,850
bringing things together fission means
splitting things apart so fission

1764
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:30,860
splitting things apart so fission
 

1765
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:33,950
splitting things apart so fission
requires the heaviest instead of the

1766
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:33,960
requires the heaviest instead of the
 

1767
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,590
requires the heaviest instead of the
lightest and the most unstable versus

1768
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:36,600
lightest and the most unstable versus
 

1769
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,470
lightest and the most unstable versus
the most stable uh elements so this

1770
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:39,480
the most stable uh elements so this
 

1771
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,930
the most stable uh elements so this
tends to be uranium or plutonium

1772
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:41,940
tends to be uranium or plutonium
 

1773
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:44,950
tends to be uranium or plutonium
primarily uranium so take uranium so

1774
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:44,960
primarily uranium so take uranium so
 

1775
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,330
primarily uranium so take uranium so
uranium-235 is one of the that this is

1776
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:47,340
uranium-235 is one of the that this is
 

1777
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:49,430
uranium-235 is one of the that this is
one of the heaviest unstable elements

1778
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:49,440
one of the heaviest unstable elements
 

1779
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,630
one of the heaviest unstable elements
and what happens is that this is a

1780
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:53,640
and what happens is that this is a
 

1781
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,130
and what happens is that this is a
fission is triggered by the fact that

1782
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:55,140
fission is triggered by the fact that
 

1783
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,810
fission is triggered by the fact that
one of these subatomic particles the

1784
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:56,820
one of these subatomic particles the
 

1785
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,450
one of these subatomic particles the
neutron which has no electric charge

1786
00:33:58,450 --> 00:33:58,460
neutron which has no electric charge
 

1787
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:01,370
neutron which has no electric charge
basically gets in proximity enough to

1788
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:01,380
basically gets in proximity enough to
 

1789
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:04,009
basically gets in proximity enough to
this and and triggers an instability

1790
00:34:04,009 --> 00:34:04,019
this and and triggers an instability
 

1791
00:34:04,019 --> 00:34:06,769
this and and triggers an instability
effectively inside of this what is

1792
00:34:06,769 --> 00:34:06,779
effectively inside of this what is
 

1793
00:34:06,779 --> 00:34:09,290
effectively inside of this what is
teetering on the border of instability

1794
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:09,300
teetering on the border of instability
 

1795
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:12,050
teetering on the border of instability
and basically splits it apart

1796
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:12,060
and basically splits it apart
 

1797
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:14,089
and basically splits it apart
and that's the fission right the

1798
00:34:14,089 --> 00:34:14,099
and that's the fission right the
 

1799
00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:15,530
and that's the fission right the
fissioning

1800
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:15,540
fissioning
 

1801
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:18,589
fissioning
um and so when that happens because the

1802
00:34:18,589 --> 00:34:18,599
um and so when that happens because the
 

1803
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:21,829
um and so when that happens because the
products that are and kind of roughly

1804
00:34:21,829 --> 00:34:21,839
products that are and kind of roughly
 

1805
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:23,210
products that are and kind of roughly
splits in two but it's not even that

1806
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:23,220
splits in two but it's not even that
 

1807
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,530
splits in two but it's not even that
it's actually more complicated splits

1808
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:24,540
it's actually more complicated splits
 

1809
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:26,270
it's actually more complicated splits
into this whole array of lighter

1810
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:26,280
into this whole array of lighter
 

1811
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,970
into this whole array of lighter
elements and nuclei and when that

1812
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:28,980
elements and nuclei and when that
 

1813
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:32,990
elements and nuclei and when that
happens there's less rest Mass

1814
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:33,000
happens there's less rest Mass
 

1815
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,010
happens there's less rest Mass
uh uh laugh than the original one so

1816
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:37,020
uh uh laugh than the original one so
 

1817
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:38,570
uh uh laugh than the original one so
it's actually the same so it's again

1818
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:38,580
it's actually the same so it's again
 

1819
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,490
it's actually the same so it's again
it's rearrangement of the strong nuclear

1820
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:40,500
it's rearrangement of the strong nuclear
 

1821
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,950
it's rearrangement of the strong nuclear
force that's happening

1822
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:42,960
force that's happening
 

1823
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,810
force that's happening
um but that's the source of the energy

1824
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:44,820
um but that's the source of the energy
 

1825
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:47,089
um but that's the source of the energy
and so in the end it's like so this is a

1826
00:34:47,089 --> 00:34:47,099
and so in the end it's like so this is a
 

1827
00:34:47,099 --> 00:34:49,909
and so in the end it's like so this is a
famous graph that we show everybody is

1828
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:49,919
famous graph that we show everybody is
 

1829
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:52,490
famous graph that we show everybody is
is basically it turns out every element

1830
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:52,500
is basically it turns out every element
 

1831
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,470
is basically it turns out every element
that exists in the periodic table all

1832
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:54,480
that exists in the periodic table all
 

1833
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,750
that exists in the periodic table all
the things that make up everything have

1834
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:56,760
the things that make up everything have
 

1835
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,030
the things that make up everything have
uh have a remember you asked a good

1836
00:34:59,030 --> 00:34:59,040
uh have a remember you asked a good
 

1837
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,530
uh have a remember you asked a good
question it was like so should we think

1838
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:00,540
question it was like so should we think
 

1839
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,630
question it was like so should we think
of mass as being the same as stored

1840
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:02,640
of mass as being the same as stored
 

1841
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,810
of mass as being the same as stored
energy yes so you can make a plot that

1842
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:05,820
energy yes so you can make a plot that
 

1843
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:08,750
energy yes so you can make a plot that
basically shows the relative amount of

1844
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:08,760
basically shows the relative amount of
 

1845
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,569
basically shows the relative amount of
stored energy in all of the elements

1846
00:35:11,569 --> 00:35:11,579
stored energy in all of the elements
 

1847
00:35:11,579 --> 00:35:13,430
stored energy in all of the elements
that are stable and make up basically

1848
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:13,440
that are stable and make up basically
 

1849
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,829
that are stable and make up basically
the world okay in the universe and it

1850
00:35:15,829 --> 00:35:15,839
the world okay in the universe and it
 

1851
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:19,190
the world okay in the universe and it
turns out that this one has a maximum

1852
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:19,200
turns out that this one has a maximum
 

1853
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,250
turns out that this one has a maximum
amount of of stability or storage at

1854
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:22,260
amount of of stability or storage at
 

1855
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,690
amount of of stability or storage at
iron

1856
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:23,700
iron
 

1857
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,609
iron
so it's kind of in the middle of the

1858
00:35:25,609 --> 00:35:25,619
so it's kind of in the middle of the
 

1859
00:35:25,619 --> 00:35:27,530
so it's kind of in the middle of the
periodic table because this goes from

1860
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:27,540
periodic table because this goes from
 

1861
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:30,890
periodic table because this goes from
you know it's roughly that and so this

1862
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:30,900
you know it's roughly that and so this
 

1863
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:34,190
you know it's roughly that and so this
what that means is that if

1864
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:34,200
what that means is that if
 

1865
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,170
what that means is that if
um if you take something heavier than

1866
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:36,180
um if you take something heavier than
 

1867
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:38,390
um if you take something heavier than
iron like uranium which is which is more

1868
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:38,400
iron like uranium which is which is more
 

1869
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,550
iron like uranium which is which is more
than twice as heavy than that and you

1870
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:40,560
than twice as heavy than that and you
 

1871
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,990
than twice as heavy than that and you
split apart if you somehow just

1872
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:42,000
split apart if you somehow just
 

1873
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,310
split apart if you somehow just
magically you just split apart as

1874
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:43,320
magically you just split apart as
 

1875
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,390
magically you just split apart as
constituents and you get something

1876
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:44,400
constituents and you get something
 

1877
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,790
constituents and you get something
that's latter that will because it moves

1878
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:46,800
that's latter that will because it moves
 

1879
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,470
that's latter that will because it moves
to a more stable energy state it

1880
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:48,480
to a more stable energy state it
 

1881
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,970
to a more stable energy state it
releases kinetic energy that's the

1882
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:49,980
releases kinetic energy that's the
 

1883
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:52,190
releases kinetic energy that's the
energy that we use kinetic energy

1884
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:52,200
energy that we use kinetic energy
 

1885
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,990
energy that we use kinetic energy
meaning the movement of things so it's

1886
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:54,000
meaning the movement of things so it's
 

1887
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,370
meaning the movement of things so it's
actually an energy you can do something

1888
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:55,380
actually an energy you can do something
 

1889
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:58,490
actually an energy you can do something
with and fusion sits on the other side

1890
00:35:58,490 --> 00:35:58,500
with and fusion sits on the other side
 

1891
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:01,069
with and fusion sits on the other side
of that because it's also moving towards

1892
00:36:01,069 --> 00:36:01,079
of that because it's also moving towards
 

1893
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:03,410
of that because it's also moving towards
iron but it's do it has to do it through

1894
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:03,420
iron but it's do it has to do it through
 

1895
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:06,710
iron but it's do it has to do it through
Fusion together so this leads to some

1896
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:06,720
Fusion together so this leads to some
 

1897
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,050
Fusion together so this leads to some
pretty profound differences as I said

1898
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:09,060
pretty profound differences as I said
 

1899
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:12,109
pretty profound differences as I said
they have some underlying physics or

1900
00:36:12,109 --> 00:36:12,119
they have some underlying physics or
 

1901
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:13,790
they have some underlying physics or
science

1902
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:13,800
science
 

1903
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,950
science
um uh proximity to each other but

1904
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:15,960
um uh proximity to each other but
 

1905
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,750
um uh proximity to each other but
they're literally the opposite so Fusion

1906
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:17,760
they're literally the opposite so Fusion
 

1907
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,730
they're literally the opposite so Fusion
why is this it actually goes into

1908
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:19,740
why is this it actually goes into
 

1909
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,530
why is this it actually goes into
practical implications of it which is

1910
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:21,540
practical implications of it which is
 

1911
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:22,910
practical implications of it which is
that fission can happen at room

1912
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:22,920
that fission can happen at room
 

1913
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:23,990
that fission can happen at room
temperature

1914
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:24,000
temperature
 

1915
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,170
temperature
it's because there's this neutron has no

1916
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:27,180
it's because there's this neutron has no
 

1917
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:29,270
it's because there's this neutron has no
electric charge and therefore it's

1918
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:29,280
electric charge and therefore it's
 

1919
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,730
electric charge and therefore it's
literally room temperature neutrons that

1920
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:31,740
literally room temperature neutrons that
 

1921
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:33,410
literally room temperature neutrons that
actually trigger the reaction so this

1922
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:33,420
actually trigger the reaction so this
 

1923
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:34,730
actually trigger the reaction so this
means

1924
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:34,740
means
 

1925
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:37,490
means
um in order to establish uh what's going

1926
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:37,500
um in order to establish uh what's going
 

1927
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,870
um in order to establish uh what's going
on with it and it works by a chain

1928
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:38,880
on with it and it works by a chain
 

1929
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,970
on with it and it works by a chain
reaction is that you can do this at room

1930
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:40,980
reaction is that you can do this at room
 

1931
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:43,069
reaction is that you can do this at room
temperature so Enrico Fermi did this

1932
00:36:43,069 --> 00:36:43,079
temperature so Enrico Fermi did this
 

1933
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:45,470
temperature so Enrico Fermi did this
like on a on a University campus

1934
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:45,480
like on a on a University campus
 

1935
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,690
like on a on a University campus
University of Chicago campus the first

1936
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:47,700
University of Chicago campus the first
 

1937
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,550
University of Chicago campus the first
sustained you know chain reaction was

1938
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:49,560
sustained you know chain reaction was
 

1939
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,770
sustained you know chain reaction was
done underneath the squash court

1940
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:51,780
done underneath the squash court
 

1941
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,870
done underneath the squash court
with a big blocks of graphite you know

1942
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:53,880
with a big blocks of graphite you know
 

1943
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,790
with a big blocks of graphite you know
it was still don't get me wrong an

1944
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:55,800
it was still don't get me wrong an
 

1945
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,069
it was still don't get me wrong an
incredible human achievement right but

1946
00:36:58,069 --> 00:36:58,079
incredible human achievement right but
 

1947
00:36:58,079 --> 00:36:59,630
incredible human achievement right but
that's you know and then you think about

1948
00:36:59,630 --> 00:36:59,640
that's you know and then you think about
 

1949
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,849
that's you know and then you think about
Fusion I have to build a Contraption of

1950
00:37:01,849 --> 00:37:01,859
Fusion I have to build a Contraption of
 

1951
00:37:01,859 --> 00:37:03,410
Fusion I have to build a Contraption of
some kind that's going to get to 100

1952
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:03,420
some kind that's going to get to 100
 

1953
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:05,810
some kind that's going to get to 100
million degrees okay wow that's a big

1954
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:05,820
million degrees okay wow that's a big
 

1955
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:08,210
million degrees okay wow that's a big
difference the other one is about the

1956
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:08,220
difference the other one is about the
 

1957
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:10,790
difference the other one is about the
chain reaction that namely fission works

1958
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:10,800
chain reaction that namely fission works
 

1959
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,829
chain reaction that namely fission works
by the fact that when that fission

1960
00:37:12,829 --> 00:37:12,839
by the fact that when that fission
 

1961
00:37:12,839 --> 00:37:14,930
by the fact that when that fission
occurs it actually produces free

1962
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:14,940
occurs it actually produces free
 

1963
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:17,990
occurs it actually produces free
neutrons free neutrons particularly if

1964
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:18,000
neutrons free neutrons particularly if
 

1965
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,690
neutrons free neutrons particularly if
they get slowed down to room temperature

1966
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:19,700
they get slowed down to room temperature
 

1967
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:22,130
they get slowed down to room temperature
trigger can trigger other fission

1968
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:22,140
trigger can trigger other fission
 

1969
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:24,290
trigger can trigger other fission
reactions if there's other uranium

1970
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:24,300
reactions if there's other uranium
 

1971
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:27,290
reactions if there's other uranium
nearby or physometers so this means that

1972
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:27,300
nearby or physometers so this means that
 

1973
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,030
nearby or physometers so this means that
the way that it releases energy is that

1974
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:29,040
the way that it releases energy is that
 

1975
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,190
the way that it releases energy is that
you set this up in a very careful way

1976
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:31,200
you set this up in a very careful way
 

1977
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,950
you set this up in a very careful way
such that every on average every

1978
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:33,960
such that every on average every
 

1979
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:37,190
such that every on average every
reaction that happens exactly releases

1980
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:37,200
reaction that happens exactly releases
 

1981
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,810
reaction that happens exactly releases
enough neutrons and slows down that they

1982
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:38,820
enough neutrons and slows down that they
 

1983
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:40,970
enough neutrons and slows down that they
actually make another reaction one

1984
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:40,980
actually make another reaction one
 

1985
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:43,609
actually make another reaction one
exactly one and what this means is that

1986
00:37:43,609 --> 00:37:43,619
exactly one and what this means is that
 

1987
00:37:43,619 --> 00:37:45,410
exactly one and what this means is that
because each reaction releases a fixed

1988
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:45,420
because each reaction releases a fixed
 

1989
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:47,990
because each reaction releases a fixed
amount of energy you do this and then in

1990
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:48,000
amount of energy you do this and then in
 

1991
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,550
amount of energy you do this and then in
time this looks like just a constant

1992
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:49,560
time this looks like just a constant
 

1993
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,109
time this looks like just a constant
power output so that's how our fission

1994
00:37:51,109 --> 00:37:51,119
power output so that's how our fission
 

1995
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:53,150
power output so that's how our fission
power plant works and so either the

1996
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:53,160
power plant works and so either the
 

1997
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,890
power plant works and so either the
control of the the chain reactions is

1998
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:54,900
control of the the chain reactions is
 

1999
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,210
control of the the chain reactions is
extremely difficult and extremely

2000
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:56,220
extremely difficult and extremely
 

2001
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:58,310
extremely difficult and extremely
important for it's very important and

2002
00:37:58,310 --> 00:37:58,320
important for it's very important and
 

2003
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,170
important for it's very important and
when you intentionally design it that it

2004
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:00,180
when you intentionally design it that it
 

2005
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:03,170
when you intentionally design it that it
creates more than one fission reaction

2006
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:03,180
creates more than one fission reaction
 

2007
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:05,930
creates more than one fission reaction
per per starting reaction that it

2008
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:05,940
per per starting reaction that it
 

2009
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:08,030
per per starting reaction that it
exponentiates away

2010
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:08,040
exponentiates away
 

2011
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,890
exponentiates away
but which is which is what a nuclear

2012
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:09,900
but which is which is what a nuclear
 

2013
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,170
but which is which is what a nuclear
weapon is yeah so how does an atomic

2014
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:12,180
weapon is yeah so how does an atomic
 

2015
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:14,450
weapon is yeah so how does an atomic
weapon work how does a hydrogen bomb

2016
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:14,460
weapon work how does a hydrogen bomb
 

2017
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:17,569
weapon work how does a hydrogen bomb
work asking for a friend yeah

2018
00:38:17,569 --> 00:38:17,579
work asking for a friend yeah
 

2019
00:38:17,579 --> 00:38:20,750
work asking for a friend yeah
yeah so um at its heart what it how what

2020
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:20,760
yeah so um at its heart what it how what
 

2021
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,230
yeah so um at its heart what it how what
you do is you very quickly put together

2022
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:23,240
you do is you very quickly put together
 

2023
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,490
you do is you very quickly put together
enough of these materials that can

2024
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:25,500
enough of these materials that can
 

2025
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,050
enough of these materials that can
undergo fission with room temperature

2026
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:27,060
undergo fission with room temperature
 

2027
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:29,750
undergo fission with room temperature
neutrons and you put them together fast

2028
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:29,760
neutrons and you put them together fast
 

2029
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,150
neutrons and you put them together fast
enough that what happens is that this

2030
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:32,160
enough that what happens is that this
 

2031
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,130
enough that what happens is that this
process can essentially grow

2032
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:34,140
process can essentially grow
 

2033
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:36,890
process can essentially grow
mathematically like very fast and so

2034
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:36,900
mathematically like very fast and so
 

2035
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,290
mathematically like very fast and so
this releases large amounts of energy so

2036
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:39,300
this releases large amounts of energy so
 

2037
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,390
this releases large amounts of energy so
that's the underlying reason that it

2038
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:41,400
that's the underlying reason that it
 

2039
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,290
that's the underlying reason that it
works

2040
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:42,300
works
 

2041
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,690
works
so you've heard of a fusion weapon so

2042
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:44,700
so you've heard of a fusion weapon so
 

2043
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,609
so you've heard of a fusion weapon so
this is interesting is that it is it but

2044
00:38:46,609 --> 00:38:46,619
this is interesting is that it is it but
 

2045
00:38:46,619 --> 00:38:48,890
this is interesting is that it is it but
it's dislike Fusion Energy in the sense

2046
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:48,900
it's dislike Fusion Energy in the sense
 

2047
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,890
it's dislike Fusion Energy in the sense
that what happens is that you're using

2048
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:51,900
that what happens is that you're using
 

2049
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:54,410
that what happens is that you're using
Fusion reactions to but it's simply it

2050
00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:54,420
Fusion reactions to but it's simply it
 

2051
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:56,450
Fusion reactions to but it's simply it
increases the gain actually of the

2052
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:56,460
increases the gain actually of the
 

2053
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,130
increases the gain actually of the
weapon rather than

2054
00:38:58,130 --> 00:38:58,140
weapon rather than
 

2055
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:00,890
weapon rather than
um it's it's not a pure at its heart

2056
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:00,900
um it's it's not a pure at its heart
 

2057
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:03,290
um it's it's not a pure at its heart
it's still a fission weapon you're just

2058
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:03,300
it's still a fission weapon you're just
 

2059
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,390
it's still a fission weapon you're just
using Fusion reactions as a sort of

2060
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:05,400
using Fusion reactions as a sort of
 

2061
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,210
using Fusion reactions as a sort of
intermediate Catalyst basically to get

2062
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:08,220
intermediate Catalyst basically to get
 

2063
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,069
intermediate Catalyst basically to get
even more energy out of it

2064
00:39:10,069 --> 00:39:10,079
even more energy out of it
 

2065
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:12,230
even more energy out of it
but it's not directly applicable to to

2066
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:12,240
but it's not directly applicable to to
 

2067
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:15,470
but it's not directly applicable to to
be used in an energy source does it

2068
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:15,480
be used in an energy source does it
 

2069
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:18,589
be used in an energy source does it
terrify you just again to step back at

2070
00:39:18,589 --> 00:39:18,599
terrify you just again to step back at
 

2071
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:20,990
terrify you just again to step back at
the philosophical that humans have been

2072
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:21,000
the philosophical that humans have been
 

2073
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,970
the philosophical that humans have been
able to use physics and

2074
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:22,980
able to use physics and
 

2075
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:26,270
able to use physics and
uh engineering to create such powerful

2076
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:26,280
uh engineering to create such powerful
 

2077
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,190
uh engineering to create such powerful
weapons

2078
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:28,200
weapons
 

2079
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,470
weapons
I wouldn't say terrify I mean we should

2080
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:30,480
I wouldn't say terrify I mean we should
 

2081
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,329
I wouldn't say terrify I mean we should
be

2082
00:39:32,329 --> 00:39:32,339
be
 

2083
00:39:32,339 --> 00:39:34,730
be
this is the this is the progress of

2084
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:34,740
this is the this is the progress of
 

2085
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:37,430
this is the this is the progress of
human every time that we've gone access

2086
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:37,440
human every time that we've gone access
 

2087
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,050
human every time that we've gone access
you talk again you know the day the

2088
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:39,060
you talk again you know the day the
 

2089
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:41,270
you talk again you know the day the
universe changed those really changed

2090
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:41,280
universe changed those really changed
 

2091
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,010
universe changed those really changed
when we got access to new kinds of

2092
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:43,020
when we got access to new kinds of
 

2093
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:45,170
when we got access to new kinds of
energy sources but every time you get

2094
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:45,180
energy sources but every time you get
 

2095
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:47,150
energy sources but every time you get
acts and typically what this meant was

2096
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:47,160
acts and typically what this meant was
 

2097
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:50,150
acts and typically what this meant was
you get access to more intense energy

2098
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:50,160
you get access to more intense energy
 

2099
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,010
you get access to more intense energy
right that's and that's what that was

2100
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:52,020
right that's and that's what that was
 

2101
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:54,230
right that's and that's what that was
and so the ability to move from burning

2102
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:54,240
and so the ability to move from burning
 

2103
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:58,609
and so the ability to move from burning
wood to using coal to using gasoline and

2104
00:39:58,609 --> 00:39:58,619
wood to using coal to using gasoline and
 

2105
00:39:58,619 --> 00:40:01,010
wood to using coal to using gasoline and
petrol and then finally to use this is

2106
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:01,020
petrol and then finally to use this is
 

2107
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:01,910
petrol and then finally to use this is
that

2108
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:01,920
that
 

2109
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,370
that
is that both the potency and the

2110
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:04,380
is that both the potency and the
 

2111
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:06,589
is that both the potency and the
consequences are elevated

2112
00:40:06,589 --> 00:40:06,599
consequences are elevated
 

2113
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:08,810
consequences are elevated
around those things it's just like you

2114
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:08,820
around those things it's just like you
 

2115
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,490
around those things it's just like you
said the

2116
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:10,500
said the
 

2117
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:13,130
said the
the way that Fusion nuclear fusion would

2118
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:13,140
the way that Fusion nuclear fusion would
 

2119
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,810
the way that Fusion nuclear fusion would
change the world

2120
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:14,820
change the world
 

2121
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:17,150
change the world
I don't think unless we think really

2122
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:17,160
I don't think unless we think really
 

2123
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,950
I don't think unless we think really
deeply we'll be able to anticipate some

2124
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:18,960
deeply we'll be able to anticipate some
 

2125
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,270
deeply we'll be able to anticipate some
of the things we can create there's

2126
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:20,280
of the things we can create there's
 

2127
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,670
of the things we can create there's
going to be a lot of amazing stuff but

2128
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:22,680
going to be a lot of amazing stuff but
 

2129
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,109
going to be a lot of amazing stuff but
then that amazing stuff is going to

2130
00:40:24,109 --> 00:40:24,119
then that amazing stuff is going to
 

2131
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:26,690
then that amazing stuff is going to
enable more amazing stuff and more

2132
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:26,700
enable more amazing stuff and more
 

2133
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:29,390
enable more amazing stuff and more
unfortunately or uh depending how you

2134
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:29,400
unfortunately or uh depending how you
 

2135
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:32,150
unfortunately or uh depending how you
see on it more powerful weapons well

2136
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:32,160
see on it more powerful weapons well
 

2137
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,370
see on it more powerful weapons well
yeah but see that's the thing Fusion

2138
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:34,380
yeah but see that's the thing Fusion
 

2139
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:37,730
yeah but see that's the thing Fusion
breaks that Trend in the following way

2140
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:37,740
breaks that Trend in the following way
 

2141
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:40,849
breaks that Trend in the following way
so one of them so Fusion doesn't work on

2142
00:40:40,849 --> 00:40:40,859
so one of them so Fusion doesn't work on
 

2143
00:40:40,859 --> 00:40:42,170
so one of them so Fusion doesn't work on
a chain reaction

2144
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:42,180
a chain reaction
 

2145
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:44,930
a chain reaction
there's no Chain Reaction zero so this

2146
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:44,940
there's no Chain Reaction zero so this
 

2147
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:47,089
there's no Chain Reaction zero so this
means it cannot physically exponentiate

2148
00:40:47,089 --> 00:40:47,099
means it cannot physically exponentiate
 

2149
00:40:47,099 --> 00:40:49,430
means it cannot physically exponentiate
away on you because it works and

2150
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:49,440
away on you because it works and
 

2151
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,470
away on you because it works and
actually this is why Star by the way we

2152
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:51,480
actually this is why Star by the way we
 

2153
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,870
actually this is why Star by the way we
know this already it's why stars are so

2154
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:53,880
know this already it's why stars are so
 

2155
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:56,270
know this already it's why stars are so
stable why most stars and suns are so

2156
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:56,280
stable why most stars and suns are so
 

2157
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:59,510
stable why most stars and suns are so
stable it's because they are regulated

2158
00:40:59,510 --> 00:40:59,520
stable it's because they are regulated
 

2159
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,609
stable it's because they are regulated
through their own temperature and their

2160
00:41:01,609 --> 00:41:01,619
through their own temperature and their
 

2161
00:41:01,619 --> 00:41:02,569
through their own temperature and their
Heating

2162
00:41:02,569 --> 00:41:02,579
Heating
 

2163
00:41:02,579 --> 00:41:04,370
Heating
because what's happening is not that

2164
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:04,380
because what's happening is not that
 

2165
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:05,690
because what's happening is not that
there's some probability of this

2166
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:05,700
there's some probability of this
 

2167
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,670
there's some probability of this
exponentiating away is that the energy

2168
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:07,680
exponentiating away is that the energy
 

2169
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,050
exponentiating away is that the energy
that's being released by Fusion

2170
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:09,060
that's being released by Fusion
 

2171
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:11,650
that's being released by Fusion
basically is keeping the fire hot

2172
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:11,660
basically is keeping the fire hot
 

2173
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:14,690
basically is keeping the fire hot
and these tend to be you know and when

2174
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:14,700
and these tend to be you know and when
 

2175
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,190
and these tend to be you know and when
it comes down to thermodynamics and

2176
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:16,200
it comes down to thermodynamics and
 

2177
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,750
it comes down to thermodynamics and
things like this there's a reason for

2178
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:17,760
things like this there's a reason for
 

2179
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,910
things like this there's a reason for
example it's pretty easy to keep of

2180
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:19,920
example it's pretty easy to keep of
 

2181
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,890
example it's pretty easy to keep of
constant temperature like in an oven and

2182
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:21,900
constant temperature like in an oven and
 

2183
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,170
constant temperature like in an oven and
things like this it's the same thing

2184
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:23,180
things like this it's the same thing
 

2185
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:25,670
things like this it's the same thing
infusion so this is actually one of the

2186
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:25,680
infusion so this is actually one of the
 

2187
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,650
infusion so this is actually one of the
features that I would argue Fusion

2188
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:27,660
features that I would argue Fusion
 

2189
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:31,010
features that I would argue Fusion
breaks the breaks the trend of this is

2190
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:31,020
breaks the breaks the trend of this is
 

2191
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:34,010
breaks the breaks the trend of this is
that it's it has more energy intensity

2192
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:34,020
that it's it has more energy intensity
 

2193
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:37,069
that it's it has more energy intensity
than than fission on on paper but it

2194
00:41:37,069 --> 00:41:37,079
than than fission on on paper but it
 

2195
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:39,410
than than fission on on paper but it
actually does not have the consequences

2196
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:39,420
actually does not have the consequences
 

2197
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:42,470
actually does not have the consequences
of control and sort of Rapid Release of

2198
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:42,480
of control and sort of Rapid Release of
 

2199
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,990
of control and sort of Rapid Release of
the energy because it's actually it the

2200
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:45,000
the energy because it's actually it the
 

2201
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,970
the energy because it's actually it the
physical system just doesn't want to do

2202
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:46,980
physical system just doesn't want to do
 

2203
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,770
physical system just doesn't want to do
that yeah we're gonna have to look

2204
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:48,780
that yeah we're gonna have to look
 

2205
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:51,349
that yeah we're gonna have to look
elsewhere for the weapons with which we

2206
00:41:51,349 --> 00:41:51,359
elsewhere for the weapons with which we
 

2207
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:53,390
elsewhere for the weapons with which we
fight World War III

2208
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:53,400
fight World War III
 

2209
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,630
fight World War III
fair enough uh so

2210
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:56,640
fair enough uh so
 

2211
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:00,109
fair enough uh so
what is plasma that you may may have not

2212
00:42:00,109 --> 00:42:00,119
what is plasma that you may may have not
 

2213
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:01,430
what is plasma that you may may have not
mentioned you mentioned ions and

2214
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:01,440
mentioned you mentioned ions and
 

2215
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,829
mentioned you mentioned ions and
electrons so what is plasma what is the

2216
00:42:03,829 --> 00:42:03,839
electrons so what is plasma what is the
 

2217
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:06,410
electrons so what is plasma what is the
role of plasma and nuclear fusion so

2218
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:06,420
role of plasma and nuclear fusion so
 

2219
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:09,109
role of plasma and nuclear fusion so
plasma is a phase of matter or state of

2220
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:09,119
plasma is a phase of matter or state of
 

2221
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:10,430
plasma is a phase of matter or state of
matter so

2222
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:10,440
matter so
 

2223
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,890
matter so
unfortunately our schools don't it's

2224
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:12,900
unfortunately our schools don't it's
 

2225
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:14,329
unfortunately our schools don't it's
like I'm not sure why this is the case

2226
00:42:14,329 --> 00:42:14,339
like I'm not sure why this is the case
 

2227
00:42:14,339 --> 00:42:17,089
like I'm not sure why this is the case
but all all children learn the three

2228
00:42:17,089 --> 00:42:17,099
but all all children learn the three
 

2229
00:42:17,099 --> 00:42:19,370
but all all children learn the three
phases of matter right so and what does

2230
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:19,380
phases of matter right so and what does
 

2231
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:21,470
phases of matter right so and what does
this mean so we'll take like Waters an

2232
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:21,480
this mean so we'll take like Waters an
 

2233
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:24,589
this mean so we'll take like Waters an
example so if you if it's cold it's ice

2234
00:42:24,589 --> 00:42:24,599
example so if you if it's cold it's ice
 

2235
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:27,349
example so if you if it's cold it's ice
it's in a solid phase right and then if

2236
00:42:27,349 --> 00:42:27,359
it's in a solid phase right and then if
 

2237
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:28,849
it's in a solid phase right and then if
you heat it up the temp it's the

2238
00:42:28,849 --> 00:42:28,859
you heat it up the temp it's the
 

2239
00:42:28,859 --> 00:42:31,430
you heat it up the temp it's the
temperature that typically depends sets

2240
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:31,440
temperature that typically depends sets
 

2241
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,870
temperature that typically depends sets
the phase although it's not it's not

2242
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:32,880
the phase although it's not it's not
 

2243
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,329
the phase although it's not it's not
only temperature so you heat it up and

2244
00:42:35,329 --> 00:42:35,339
only temperature so you heat it up and
 

2245
00:42:35,339 --> 00:42:37,010
only temperature so you heat it up and
you go to a liquid and obviously it

2246
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:37,020
you go to a liquid and obviously it
 

2247
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:38,569
you go to a liquid and obviously it
changes its physical properties because

2248
00:42:38,569 --> 00:42:38,579
changes its physical properties because
 

2249
00:42:38,579 --> 00:42:40,430
changes its physical properties because
it can you can pour it and so forth

2250
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:40,440
it can you can pour it and so forth
 

2251
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,170
it can you can pour it and so forth
right and then if you heat this up

2252
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:42,180
right and then if you heat this up
 

2253
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:44,750
right and then if you heat this up
enough it turns into a gas and a gas

2254
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:44,760
enough it turns into a gas and a gas
 

2255
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,849
enough it turns into a gas and a gas
behaves differently because there's a

2256
00:42:46,849 --> 00:42:46,859
behaves differently because there's a
 

2257
00:42:46,859 --> 00:42:48,410
behaves differently because there's a
very Sudden Change in the density

2258
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:48,420
very Sudden Change in the density
 

2259
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:50,210
very Sudden Change in the density
actually that's what's happening so it

2260
00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:50,220
actually that's what's happening so it
 

2261
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:51,890
actually that's what's happening so it
changes by about a factor of ten

2262
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:51,900
changes by about a factor of ten
 

2263
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:53,750
changes by about a factor of ten
thousand in density from the from the

2264
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:53,760
thousand in density from the from the
 

2265
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,609
thousand in density from the from the
liquid phase into when you make it into

2266
00:42:55,609 --> 00:42:55,619
liquid phase into when you make it into
 

2267
00:42:55,619 --> 00:42:58,150
liquid phase into when you make it into
steam atmospheric pressure all very good

2268
00:42:58,150 --> 00:42:58,160
steam atmospheric pressure all very good
 

2269
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,650
steam atmospheric pressure all very good
except the problem is they forgot like

2270
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:00,660
except the problem is they forgot like
 

2271
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:02,270
except the problem is they forgot like
what happens if you just keep elevating

2272
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:02,280
what happens if you just keep elevating
 

2273
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,130
what happens if you just keep elevating
the temperature you don't want to give

2274
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:04,140
the temperature you don't want to give
 

2275
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:06,470
the temperature you don't want to give
kids ideas they're going to start

2276
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:06,480
kids ideas they're going to start
 

2277
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,790
kids ideas they're going to start
experimenting they're going to start

2278
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:07,800
experimenting they're going to start
 

2279
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,349
experimenting they're going to start
heating up the gas it's good to start

2280
00:43:09,349 --> 00:43:09,359
heating up the gas it's good to start
 

2281
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:11,210
heating up the gas it's good to start
doing anyway so you

2282
00:43:11,210 --> 00:43:11,220
doing anyway so you
 

2283
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:13,430
doing anyway so you
um it turns out that once you get above

2284
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:13,440
um it turns out that once you get above
 

2285
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,710
um it turns out that once you get above
it's approximately five or ten thousand

2286
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:15,720
it's approximately five or ten thousand
 

2287
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,930
it's approximately five or ten thousand
degrees Celsius then you hit a new phase

2288
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:17,940
degrees Celsius then you hit a new phase
 

2289
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:19,670
degrees Celsius then you hit a new phase
of matter and actually that's the phase

2290
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:19,680
of matter and actually that's the phase
 

2291
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,710
of matter and actually that's the phase
of matter that is for all pretty much

2292
00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:21,720
of matter that is for all pretty much
 

2293
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,270
of matter that is for all pretty much
all the temperatures that are above that

2294
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:23,280
all the temperatures that are above that
 

2295
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,309
all the temperatures that are above that
as well too

2296
00:43:25,309 --> 00:43:25,319
as well too
 

2297
00:43:25,319 --> 00:43:28,069
as well too
um and so what does that mean so it

2298
00:43:28,069 --> 00:43:28,079
um and so what does that mean so it
 

2299
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:29,390
um and so what does that mean so it
actually changes phase so it's a

2300
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:29,400
actually changes phase so it's a
 

2301
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,010
actually changes phase so it's a
different state of matter and the reason

2302
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:31,020
different state of matter and the reason
 

2303
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:33,050
different state of matter and the reason
that it becomes a different state of

2304
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:33,060
that it becomes a different state of
 

2305
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:35,930
that it becomes a different state of
matter is that it's hot enough that what

2306
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:35,940
matter is that it's hot enough that what
 

2307
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:38,690
matter is that it's hot enough that what
happens is that the atoms that make up

2308
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:38,700
happens is that the atoms that make up
 

2309
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:40,190
happens is that the atoms that make up
remember go back to Feynman right

2310
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:40,200
remember go back to Feynman right
 

2311
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,290
remember go back to Feynman right
everything's made up of these individual

2312
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:42,300
everything's made up of these individual
 

2313
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:45,109
everything's made up of these individual
things these atoms but atoms can

2314
00:43:45,109 --> 00:43:45,119
things these atoms but atoms can
 

2315
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:47,990
things these atoms but atoms can
actually themselves be

2316
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:48,000
actually themselves be
 

2317
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,750
actually themselves be
um which are which are made of nuclei

2318
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:50,760
um which are which are made of nuclei
 

2319
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:53,390
um which are which are made of nuclei
which contain the positive particles and

2320
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:53,400
which contain the positive particles and
 

2321
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,010
which contain the positive particles and
the neutrons and then the electrons

2322
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:55,020
the neutrons and then the electrons
 

2323
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:58,730
the neutrons and then the electrons
which are very very light very much less

2324
00:43:58,730 --> 00:43:58,740
which are very very light very much less
 

2325
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:00,950
which are very very light very much less
mass than than the nucleus and that

2326
00:44:00,950 --> 00:44:00,960
mass than than the nucleus and that
 

2327
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,450
mass than than the nucleus and that
surround this this is what makes up an

2328
00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:02,460
surround this this is what makes up an
 

2329
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:05,089
surround this this is what makes up an
atom so a plasma is what happens when

2330
00:44:05,089 --> 00:44:05,099
atom so a plasma is what happens when
 

2331
00:44:05,099 --> 00:44:07,670
atom so a plasma is what happens when
you start pulling away enough of those

2332
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:07,680
you start pulling away enough of those
 

2333
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,430
you start pulling away enough of those
electrons that they're free from the ion

2334
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:10,440
electrons that they're free from the ion
 

2335
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:13,130
electrons that they're free from the ion
so almost all the atoms that make up us

2336
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:13,140
so almost all the atoms that make up us
 

2337
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:15,050
so almost all the atoms that make up us
up and this water and all that the

2338
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:15,060
up and this water and all that the
 

2339
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:16,790
up and this water and all that the
electrons are in tightly bound States

2340
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:16,800
electrons are in tightly bound States
 

2341
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,470
electrons are in tightly bound States
and basically they're extremely stable

2342
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:18,480
and basically they're extremely stable
 

2343
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,569
and basically they're extremely stable
once you're about five thousand or ten

2344
00:44:20,569 --> 00:44:20,579
once you're about five thousand or ten
 

2345
00:44:20,579 --> 00:44:22,370
once you're about five thousand or ten
thousand degrees you start pulling off

2346
00:44:22,370 --> 00:44:22,380
thousand degrees you start pulling off
 

2347
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:24,650
thousand degrees you start pulling off
the electrons and what this means is

2348
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:24,660
the electrons and what this means is
 

2349
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:28,010
the electrons and what this means is
that now the medium that is there its

2350
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:28,020
that now the medium that is there its
 

2351
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:29,870
that now the medium that is there its
constituent particles have mostly have

2352
00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:29,880
constituent particles have mostly have
 

2353
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,550
constituent particles have mostly have
net charge on them

2354
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:31,560
net charge on them
 

2355
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:34,430
net charge on them
so why does that matter it's because now

2356
00:44:34,430 --> 00:44:34,440
so why does that matter it's because now
 

2357
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,650
so why does that matter it's because now
this means that the particles can

2358
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:36,660
this means that the particles can
 

2359
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:38,510
this means that the particles can
interact but through their electric

2360
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:38,520
interact but through their electric
 

2361
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:40,069
interact but through their electric
charge in some sense they were when it

2362
00:44:40,069 --> 00:44:40,079
charge in some sense they were when it
 

2363
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:41,630
charge in some sense they were when it
was in the atom as well too but now that

2364
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:41,640
was in the atom as well too but now that
 

2365
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,790
was in the atom as well too but now that
they're free particles this means that

2366
00:44:43,790 --> 00:44:43,800
they're free particles this means that
 

2367
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,950
they're free particles this means that
they start it fundamentally changes the

2368
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:45,960
they start it fundamentally changes the
 

2369
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:47,630
they start it fundamentally changes the
behavior it doesn't behave like a gas it

2370
00:44:47,630 --> 00:44:47,640
behavior it doesn't behave like a gas it
 

2371
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,250
behavior it doesn't behave like a gas it
doesn't behave like a solid or a liquid

2372
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:49,260
doesn't behave like a solid or a liquid
 

2373
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:52,550
doesn't behave like a solid or a liquid
I mean he's like a plasma right and so

2374
00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:52,560
I mean he's like a plasma right and so
 

2375
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,890
I mean he's like a plasma right and so
why is this why is it disappointing that

2376
00:44:54,890 --> 00:44:54,900
why is this why is it disappointing that
 

2377
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,329
why is this why is it disappointing that
we don't speak about this it's because

2378
00:44:56,329 --> 00:44:56,339
we don't speak about this it's because
 

2379
00:44:56,339 --> 00:44:58,970
we don't speak about this it's because
99 of the universe is in the plasma

2380
00:44:58,970 --> 00:44:58,980
99 of the universe is in the plasma
 

2381
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:01,190
99 of the universe is in the plasma
State it's called Stars

2382
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:01,200
State it's called Stars
 

2383
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,309
State it's called Stars
and in fact our own Sun at the center of

2384
00:45:04,309 --> 00:45:04,319
and in fact our own Sun at the center of
 

2385
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:06,650
and in fact our own Sun at the center of
the sun is what clearly a plasma but

2386
00:45:06,650 --> 00:45:06,660
the sun is what clearly a plasma but
 

2387
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:08,390
the sun is what clearly a plasma but
actually the surface of the sun which is

2388
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:08,400
actually the surface of the sun which is
 

2389
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:12,650
actually the surface of the sun which is
around 5500 Celsius is also a plasma

2390
00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:12,660
around 5500 Celsius is also a plasma
 

2391
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:14,390
around 5500 Celsius is also a plasma
because it's hot enough that is that in

2392
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:14,400
because it's hot enough that is that in
 

2393
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,069
because it's hot enough that is that in
fact the things that you see sometimes

2394
00:45:16,069 --> 00:45:16,079
fact the things that you see sometimes
 

2395
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:17,809
fact the things that you see sometimes
you see these pictures from the surface

2396
00:45:17,809 --> 00:45:17,819
you see these pictures from the surface
 

2397
00:45:17,819 --> 00:45:20,569
you see these pictures from the surface
of the Sun amazing like Satellite

2398
00:45:20,569 --> 00:45:20,579
of the Sun amazing like Satellite
 

2399
00:45:20,579 --> 00:45:22,910
of the Sun amazing like Satellite
photographs of like those big arms of

2400
00:45:22,910 --> 00:45:22,920
photographs of like those big arms of
 

2401
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,890
photographs of like those big arms of
things and of light coming off of the

2402
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:24,900
things and of light coming off of the
 

2403
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:26,390
things and of light coming off of the
surface of the Sun and solar flares

those are plasmas what are some

2406
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:28,200
those are plasmas what are some
 

2407
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,410
those are plasmas what are some
interesting ways that this forced state

2408
00:45:30,410 --> 00:45:30,420
interesting ways that this forced state
 

2409
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:32,270
interesting ways that this forced state
of matter is different than gas

2410
00:45:32,270 --> 00:45:32,280
of matter is different than gas
 

2411
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:34,970
of matter is different than gas
let's go to how a gas works right so the

2412
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:34,980
let's go to how a gas works right so the
 

2413
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:36,410
let's go to how a gas works right so the
reason a gap and it goes back to

2414
00:45:36,410 --> 00:45:36,420
reason a gap and it goes back to
 

2415
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:37,910
reason a gap and it goes back to
fireman's Brilliance and saying that

2416
00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:37,920
fireman's Brilliance and saying that
 

2417
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,950
fireman's Brilliance and saying that
this is the most important concept the

2418
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:39,960
this is the most important concept the
 

2419
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:42,589
this is the most important concept the
reason actually solid liquid and gas

2420
00:45:42,589 --> 00:45:42,599
reason actually solid liquid and gas
 

2421
00:45:42,599 --> 00:45:44,750
reason actually solid liquid and gas
phases work is because the the nature of

2422
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:44,760
phases work is because the the nature of
 

2423
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,730
phases work is because the the nature of
the interaction between the atoms

2424
00:45:46,730 --> 00:45:46,740
the interaction between the atoms
 

2425
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:49,910
the interaction between the atoms
changes and so in a gas you can think of

2426
00:45:49,910 --> 00:45:49,920
changes and so in a gas you can think of
 

2427
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,309
changes and so in a gas you can think of
this as being this room and the things

2428
00:45:52,309 --> 00:45:52,319
this as being this room and the things
 

2429
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:54,290
this as being this room and the things
although you can't see them is that the

2430
00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:54,300
although you can't see them is that the
 

2431
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:57,650
although you can't see them is that the
molecules are flying around but then

2432
00:45:57,650 --> 00:45:57,660
molecules are flying around but then
 

2433
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:59,329
molecules are flying around but then
with some frequency they basically

2434
00:45:59,329 --> 00:45:59,339
with some frequency they basically
 

2435
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:01,550
with some frequency they basically
bounce into each other and when they

2436
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:01,560
bounce into each other and when they
 

2437
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,730
bounce into each other and when they
bounce into each other the exchange

2438
00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:03,740
bounce into each other the exchange
 

2439
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:07,190
bounce into each other the exchange
momentum and energy around on this

2440
00:46:07,190 --> 00:46:07,200
momentum and energy around on this
 

2441
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,770
momentum and energy around on this
and so it turns out that the probability

2442
00:46:09,770 --> 00:46:09,780
and so it turns out that the probability
 

2443
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:12,589
and so it turns out that the probability
and the distances and the scattering of

2444
00:46:12,589 --> 00:46:12,599
and the distances and the scattering of
 

2445
00:46:12,599 --> 00:46:14,990
and the distances and the scattering of
those of what they do it's it's those

2446
00:46:14,990 --> 00:46:15,000
those of what they do it's it's those
 

2447
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,109
those of what they do it's it's those
interactions that set the uh about how a

2448
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:18,119
interactions that set the uh about how a
 

2449
00:46:18,119 --> 00:46:20,390
interactions that set the uh about how a
gas behaves so what do you mean by this

2450
00:46:20,390 --> 00:46:20,400
gas behaves so what do you mean by this
 

2451
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:23,390
gas behaves so what do you mean by this
well so for example if I take a a an

2452
00:46:23,390 --> 00:46:23,400
well so for example if I take a a an
 

2453
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,130
well so for example if I take a a an
imaginary test particle of some kind

2454
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:25,140
imaginary test particle of some kind
 

2455
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:27,410
imaginary test particle of some kind
like I spray something into the air

2456
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:27,420
like I spray something into the air
 

2457
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:28,970
like I spray something into the air
that's got a particular color in fact

2458
00:46:28,970 --> 00:46:28,980
that's got a particular color in fact
 

2459
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:30,290
that's got a particular color in fact
you can do it in liquids as well too

2460
00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:30,300
you can do it in liquids as well too
 

2461
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:34,550
you can do it in liquids as well too
like how it gradually will disperse away

2462
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:34,560
like how it gradually will disperse away
 

2463
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:37,069
like how it gradually will disperse away
from you this is this is fundamentally

2464
00:46:37,069 --> 00:46:37,079
from you this is this is fundamentally
 

2465
00:46:37,079 --> 00:46:39,290
from you this is this is fundamentally
set because of the way that those

2466
00:46:39,290 --> 00:46:39,300
set because of the way that those
 

2467
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:40,849
set because of the way that those
particles are bouncing into the

2468
00:46:40,849 --> 00:46:40,859
particles are bouncing into the
 

2469
00:46:40,859 --> 00:46:43,849
particles are bouncing into the
probabilities of those uh the rate that

2470
00:46:43,849 --> 00:46:43,859
probabilities of those uh the rate that
 

2471
00:46:43,859 --> 00:46:45,650
probabilities of those uh the rate that
they go at and the distance that they go

2472
00:46:45,650 --> 00:46:45,660
they go at and the distance that they go
 

2473
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:47,690
they go at and the distance that they go
out and so forth so this was figured out

2474
00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:47,700
out and so forth so this was figured out
 

2475
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:49,370
out and so forth so this was figured out
by Einstein and others at the beginning

2476
00:46:49,370 --> 00:46:49,380
by Einstein and others at the beginning
 

2477
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:51,890
by Einstein and others at the beginning
of the Browning motion all these kinds

2478
00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:51,900
of the Browning motion all these kinds
 

2479
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:54,170
of the Browning motion all these kinds
of things these are these were set um up

2480
00:46:54,170 --> 00:46:54,180
of things these are these were set um up
 

2481
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:55,849
of things these are these were set um up
at the beginning of the last century and

2482
00:46:55,849 --> 00:46:55,859
at the beginning of the last century and
 

2483
00:46:55,859 --> 00:46:58,069
at the beginning of the last century and
it was really like this great Revelation

2484
00:46:58,069 --> 00:46:58,079
it was really like this great Revelation
 

2485
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:00,349
it was really like this great Revelation
wow this is why matter behaves the way

2486
00:47:00,349 --> 00:47:00,359
wow this is why matter behaves the way
 

2487
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:02,329
wow this is why matter behaves the way
that it does like wow

2488
00:47:02,329 --> 00:47:02,339
that it does like wow
 

2489
00:47:02,339 --> 00:47:03,470
that it does like wow
um

2490
00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:03,480
um
 

2491
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:05,930
um
um so but it's really like and also in

2492
00:47:05,930 --> 00:47:05,940
um so but it's really like and also in
 

2493
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:08,150
um so but it's really like and also in
liquids and in solids like what really

2494
00:47:08,150 --> 00:47:08,160
liquids and in solids like what really
 

2495
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:11,150
liquids and in solids like what really
matters is is is is is how you're

2496
00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:11,160
matters is is is is is how you're
 

2497
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:13,370
matters is is is is is how you're
interacting with your nearest neighbor

2498
00:47:13,370 --> 00:47:13,380
interacting with your nearest neighbor
 

2499
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:15,230
interacting with your nearest neighbor
so you think about that one the gas

2500
00:47:15,230 --> 00:47:15,240
so you think about that one the gas
 

2501
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,430
so you think about that one the gas
particles are basically going around

2502
00:47:16,430 --> 00:47:16,440
particles are basically going around
 

2503
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:18,410
particles are basically going around
until the until they actually hit into

2504
00:47:18,410 --> 00:47:18,420
until the until they actually hit into
 

2505
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:20,089
until the until they actually hit into
each other though they don't really

2506
00:47:20,089 --> 00:47:20,099
each other though they don't really
 

2507
00:47:20,099 --> 00:47:21,950
each other though they don't really
exchange information and it's the same

2508
00:47:21,950 --> 00:47:21,960
exchange information and it's the same
 

2509
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,450
exchange information and it's the same
in a liquid you're kind of beside each

2510
00:47:23,450 --> 00:47:23,460
in a liquid you're kind of beside each
 

2511
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:25,069
in a liquid you're kind of beside each
other but you can kind of move around in

2512
00:47:25,069 --> 00:47:25,079
other but you can kind of move around in
 

2513
00:47:25,079 --> 00:47:26,930
other but you can kind of move around in
a solid you're literally like stuck

2514
00:47:26,930 --> 00:47:26,940
a solid you're literally like stuck
 

2515
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:28,609
a solid you're literally like stuck
beside your neighbor you can't move like

2516
00:47:28,609 --> 00:47:28,619
beside your neighbor you can't move like
 

2517
00:47:28,619 --> 00:47:29,630
beside your neighbor you can't move like
yeah

2518
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:29,640
yeah
 

2519
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:32,270
yeah
plasmas are are weird in the sense is

2520
00:47:32,270 --> 00:47:32,280
plasmas are are weird in the sense is
 

2521
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:34,730
plasmas are are weird in the sense is
that they're it's not like that so and

2522
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:34,740
that they're it's not like that so and
 

2523
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:36,710
that they're it's not like that so and
it's because the particles have electric

2524
00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:36,720
it's because the particles have electric
 

2525
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:39,230
it's because the particles have electric
charge this means that they can push

2526
00:47:39,230 --> 00:47:39,240
charge this means that they can push
 

2527
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:41,450
charge this means that they can push
against each other without actually

2528
00:47:41,450 --> 00:47:41,460
against each other without actually
 

2529
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:43,849
against each other without actually
being in close proximity to each other

2530
00:47:43,849 --> 00:47:43,859
being in close proximity to each other
 

2531
00:47:43,859 --> 00:47:46,430
being in close proximity to each other
it's not that's not an infinitely true

2532
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:46,440
it's not that's not an infinitely true
 

2533
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,589
it's not that's not an infinitely true
statement which we go together it's a

2534
00:47:48,589 --> 00:47:48,599
statement which we go together it's a
 

2535
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:50,390
statement which we go together it's a
little bit more technical but basically

2536
00:47:50,390 --> 00:47:50,400
little bit more technical but basically
 

2537
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,130
little bit more technical but basically
this means that you can start having

2538
00:47:52,130 --> 00:47:52,140
this means that you can start having
 

2539
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:54,650
this means that you can start having
action or exchange of information at a

2540
00:47:54,650 --> 00:47:54,660
action or exchange of information at a
 

2541
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:55,730
action or exchange of information at a
distance

2542
00:47:55,730 --> 00:47:55,740
distance
 

2543
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:57,770
distance
and that's in fact the definition of a

2544
00:47:57,770 --> 00:47:57,780
and that's in fact the definition of a
 

2545
00:47:57,780 --> 00:47:59,450
and that's in fact the definition of a
plasma that it says these have a

2546
00:47:59,450 --> 00:47:59,460
plasma that it says these have a
 

2547
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:01,010
plasma that it says these have a
technical name is called a coulomb

2548
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:01,020
technical name is called a coulomb
 

2549
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:02,270
technical name is called a coulomb
collision it just means that it's

2550
00:48:02,270 --> 00:48:02,280
collision it just means that it's
 

2551
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:04,250
collision it just means that it's
dictated by this Force which is being

2552
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:04,260
dictated by this Force which is being
 

2553
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:07,010
dictated by this Force which is being
pushed between the charged particles is

2554
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:07,020
pushed between the charged particles is
 

2555
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:09,710
pushed between the charged particles is
that the definition of a plasma is a is

2556
00:48:09,710 --> 00:48:09,720
that the definition of a plasma is a is
 

2557
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,750
that the definition of a plasma is a is
a medium in which the collective

2558
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:11,760
a medium in which the collective
 

2559
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:14,089
a medium in which the collective
behavior is dominated by these

2560
00:48:14,089 --> 00:48:14,099
behavior is dominated by these
 

2561
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:15,950
behavior is dominated by these
collisions at a distance

2562
00:48:15,950 --> 00:48:15,960
collisions at a distance
 

2563
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:17,630
collisions at a distance
so you can imagine then this starts to

2564
00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:17,640
so you can imagine then this starts to
 

2565
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:22,250
so you can imagine then this starts to
to give you some Strange Behaviors

2566
00:48:22,250 --> 00:48:22,260
to give you some Strange Behaviors
 

2567
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:24,829
to give you some Strange Behaviors
um uh which I could I could quickly talk

2568
00:48:24,829 --> 00:48:24,839
um uh which I could I could quickly talk
 

2569
00:48:24,839 --> 00:48:26,530
um uh which I could I could quickly talk
about like for example one of the most

2570
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:26,540
about like for example one of the most
 

2571
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:29,809
about like for example one of the most
counterintuitive ones is as plasmas get

2572
00:48:29,809 --> 00:48:29,819
counterintuitive ones is as plasmas get
 

2573
00:48:29,819 --> 00:48:32,690
counterintuitive ones is as plasmas get
more hot as they get higher in

2574
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:32,700
more hot as they get higher in
 

2575
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:34,670
more hot as they get higher in
temperature then the collisions happen

2576
00:48:34,670 --> 00:48:34,680
temperature then the collisions happen
 

2577
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:36,710
temperature then the collisions happen
less frequently

2578
00:48:36,710 --> 00:48:36,720
less frequently
 

2579
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,990
less frequently
it's like like what that doesn't make

2580
00:48:38,990 --> 00:48:39,000
it's like like what that doesn't make
 

2581
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,270
it's like like what that doesn't make
any sense when particles go faster you

2582
00:48:41,270 --> 00:48:41,280
any sense when particles go faster you
 

2583
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,250
any sense when particles go faster you
think they would Collide more often

2584
00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:43,260
think they would Collide more often
 

2585
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:45,530
think they would Collide more often
but because the particles are

2586
00:48:45,530 --> 00:48:45,540
but because the particles are
 

2587
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:47,030
but because the particles are
interacting through interacting through

2588
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:47,040
interacting through interacting through
 

2589
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:49,010
interacting through interacting through
their electric field when they're going

2590
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:49,020
their electric field when they're going
 

2591
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:51,950
their electric field when they're going
faster they actually spend less time in

2592
00:48:51,950 --> 00:48:51,960
faster they actually spend less time in
 

2593
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:54,109
faster they actually spend less time in
the influential field of each other and

2594
00:48:54,109 --> 00:48:54,119
the influential field of each other and
 

2595
00:48:54,119 --> 00:48:56,089
the influential field of each other and
so they talk to each other Less in an

2596
00:48:56,089 --> 00:48:56,099
so they talk to each other Less in an
 

2597
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:57,770
so they talk to each other Less in an
energy and momentum exchange point of

2598
00:48:57,770 --> 00:48:57,780
energy and momentum exchange point of
 

2599
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:00,470
energy and momentum exchange point of
view it's just one of the count one of

2600
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:00,480
view it's just one of the count one of
 

2601
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,569
view it's just one of the count one of
the counter-intuitive aspects of plasmas

2602
00:49:02,569 --> 00:49:02,579
the counter-intuitive aspects of plasmas
 

2603
00:49:02,579 --> 00:49:05,630
the counter-intuitive aspects of plasmas
which is probably very uh relevant for

2604
00:49:05,630 --> 00:49:05,640
which is probably very uh relevant for
 

2605
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:08,270
which is probably very uh relevant for
nuclear fusion yes exactly so if I can

2606
00:49:08,270 --> 00:49:08,280
nuclear fusion yes exactly so if I can
 

2607
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:10,010
nuclear fusion yes exactly so if I can
try to summarize

2608
00:49:10,010 --> 00:49:10,020
try to summarize
 

2609
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:12,770
try to summarize
what a nuclear fusion reactor is

2610
00:49:12,770 --> 00:49:12,780
what a nuclear fusion reactor is
 

2611
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:14,329
what a nuclear fusion reactor is
supposed to do

2612
00:49:14,329 --> 00:49:14,339
supposed to do
 

2613
00:49:14,339 --> 00:49:17,569
supposed to do
so you have what a couple of elements

2614
00:49:17,569 --> 00:49:17,579
so you have what a couple of elements
 

2615
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:19,730
so you have what a couple of elements
what are usually the elements usually

2616
00:49:19,730 --> 00:49:19,740
what are usually the elements usually
 

2617
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:21,170
what are usually the elements usually
deuterium and tritium which are the

2618
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:21,180
deuterium and tritium which are the
 

2619
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:23,210
deuterium and tritium which are the
heavy forms of hydrogen hydrogen you

2620
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:23,220
heavy forms of hydrogen hydrogen you
 

2621
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:25,430
heavy forms of hydrogen hydrogen you
have those and you start heating it

2622
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:25,440
have those and you start heating it
 

2623
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,470
have those and you start heating it
and then as you start heating it I

2624
00:49:27,470 --> 00:49:27,480
and then as you start heating it I
 

2625
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:28,910
and then as you start heating it I
forgot the temperature you said about

2626
00:49:28,910 --> 00:49:28,920
forgot the temperature you said about
 

2627
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:31,609
forgot the temperature you said about
100 million no first first it becomes oh

2628
00:49:31,609 --> 00:49:31,619
100 million no first first it becomes oh
 

2629
00:49:31,619 --> 00:49:33,410
100 million no first first it becomes oh
first it becomes a plastic so it's a gas

2630
00:49:33,410 --> 00:49:33,420
first it becomes a plastic so it's a gas
 

2631
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:35,510
first it becomes a plastic so it's a gas
and then it turns into a plasma at about

2632
00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:35,520
and then it turns into a plasma at about
 

2633
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,370
and then it turns into a plasma at about
10 000 degrees and then so you have a

2634
00:49:37,370 --> 00:49:37,380
10 000 degrees and then so you have a
 

2635
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:39,050
10 000 degrees and then so you have a
bunch of electrons and ions flying

2636
00:49:39,050 --> 00:49:39,060
bunch of electrons and ions flying
 

2637
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:41,030
bunch of electrons and ions flying
around and then you keep heating the

2638
00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:41,040
around and then you keep heating the
 

2639
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,130
around and then you keep heating the
thing

2640
00:49:42,130 --> 00:49:42,140
thing
 

2641
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:44,990
thing
and uh I guess as you heat the thing the

2642
00:49:44,990 --> 00:49:45,000
and uh I guess as you heat the thing the
 

2643
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,270
and uh I guess as you heat the thing the
ions hit each other rarer and rarer Yes

2644
00:49:47,270 --> 00:49:47,280
ions hit each other rarer and rarer Yes
 

2645
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:50,089
ions hit each other rarer and rarer Yes
except oh man that's not fun so you have

2646
00:49:50,089 --> 00:49:50,099
except oh man that's not fun so you have
 

2647
00:49:50,099 --> 00:49:52,730
except oh man that's not fun so you have
to keep heating it

2648
00:49:52,730 --> 00:49:52,740
to keep heating it
 

2649
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:55,970
to keep heating it
um such that uh you have to keep hitting

2650
00:49:55,970 --> 00:49:55,980
um such that uh you have to keep hitting
 

2651
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:57,970
um such that uh you have to keep hitting
into the probability of them colliding

2652
00:49:57,970 --> 00:49:57,980
into the probability of them colliding
 

2653
00:49:57,980 --> 00:50:01,910
into the probability of them colliding
becomes reasonably high and so and also

2654
00:50:01,910 --> 00:50:01,920
becomes reasonably high and so and also
 

2655
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,770
becomes reasonably high and so and also
on top of that I'm sorry to interrupt

2656
00:50:03,770 --> 00:50:03,780
on top of that I'm sorry to interrupt
 

2657
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:06,410
on top of that I'm sorry to interrupt
you have to prevent them from hitting

2658
00:50:06,410 --> 00:50:06,420
you have to prevent them from hitting
 

2659
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,870
you have to prevent them from hitting
the walls of the reactor that's exactly

2660
00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:08,880
the walls of the reactor that's exactly
 

2661
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,150
the walls of the reactor that's exactly
somehow so you asked about the the

2662
00:50:11,150 --> 00:50:11,160
somehow so you asked about the the
 

2663
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:13,130
somehow so you asked about the the
definitions of the requirements for

2664
00:50:13,130 --> 00:50:13,140
definitions of the requirements for
 

2665
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:15,589
definitions of the requirements for
Fusion so the most famous one or some

2666
00:50:15,589 --> 00:50:15,599
Fusion so the most famous one or some
 

2667
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:17,150
Fusion so the most famous one or some
sense the most intuitive one is the

2668
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:17,160
sense the most intuitive one is the
 

2669
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:19,370
sense the most intuitive one is the
temperature and the reason for that is

2670
00:50:19,370 --> 00:50:19,380
temperature and the reason for that is
 

2671
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:22,010
temperature and the reason for that is
that you you can make many many kinds of

2672
00:50:22,010 --> 00:50:22,020
that you you can make many many kinds of
 

2673
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:24,170
that you you can make many many kinds of
plasmas that have zero Fusion going on

2674
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:24,180
plasmas that have zero Fusion going on
 

2675
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:26,510
plasmas that have zero Fusion going on
in them and the reason for this is that

2676
00:50:26,510 --> 00:50:26,520
in them and the reason for this is that
 

2677
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:29,510
in them and the reason for this is that
the average so I mean you can make a

2678
00:50:29,510 --> 00:50:29,520
the average so I mean you can make a
 

2679
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,670
the average so I mean you can make a
plasma at around 10 000 in fact if you

2680
00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:31,680
plasma at around 10 000 in fact if you
 

2681
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,530
plasma at around 10 000 in fact if you
come by the way you're welcome to come

2682
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:33,540
come by the way you're welcome to come
 

2683
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:35,990
come by the way you're welcome to come
to our laboratory at the psfc I can show

2684
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:36,000
to our laboratory at the psfc I can show
 

2685
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,390
to our laboratory at the psfc I can show
you a demonstration of a plasma that you

2686
00:50:38,390 --> 00:50:38,400
you a demonstration of a plasma that you
 

2687
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,309
you a demonstration of a plasma that you
can see with your eyes instead of about

2688
00:50:40,309 --> 00:50:40,319
can see with your eyes instead of about
 

2689
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:42,829
can see with your eyes instead of about
10 000 degrees and you can put your hand

2690
00:50:42,829 --> 00:50:42,839
10 000 degrees and you can put your hand
 

2691
00:50:42,839 --> 00:50:44,510
10 000 degrees and you can put your hand
up beside it and all this and it's like

2692
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:44,520
up beside it and all this and it's like
 

2693
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:47,329
up beside it and all this and it's like
and nothing there's zero Fusion going on

2694
00:50:47,329 --> 00:50:47,339
and nothing there's zero Fusion going on
 

2695
00:50:47,339 --> 00:50:49,069
and nothing there's zero Fusion going on
so you have uh so what was the

2696
00:50:49,069 --> 00:50:49,079
so you have uh so what was the
 

2697
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:50,210
so you have uh so what was the
temperature of the plasma about ten

2698
00:50:50,210 --> 00:50:50,220
temperature of the plasma about ten
 

2699
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:51,530
temperature of the plasma about ten
thousand degrees you can stick your hand

2700
00:50:51,530 --> 00:50:51,540
thousand degrees you can stick your hand
 

2701
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:53,210
thousand degrees you can stick your hand
in well you can't stick your hand into

2702
00:50:53,210 --> 00:50:53,220
in well you can't stick your hand into
 

2703
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:54,770
in well you can't stick your hand into
it but there's a glass tube you can

2704
00:50:54,770 --> 00:50:54,780
it but there's a glass tube you can
 

2705
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:57,290
it but there's a glass tube you can
basically see this yeah yeah and you can

2706
00:50:57,290 --> 00:50:57,300
basically see this yeah yeah and you can
 

2707
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:58,910
basically see this yeah yeah and you can
put your hand on the glass too because

2708
00:50:58,910 --> 00:50:58,920
put your hand on the glass too because
 

2709
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,950
put your hand on the glass too because
it's what's the colors of purple it's

2710
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:00,960
it's what's the colors of purple it's
 

2711
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,010
it's what's the colors of purple it's
yeah it's purple yeah

2712
00:51:03,010 --> 00:51:03,020
yeah it's purple yeah
 

2713
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:05,390
yeah it's purple yeah
it is it is kind of beautiful

2714
00:51:05,390 --> 00:51:05,400
it is it is kind of beautiful
 

2715
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,609
it is it is kind of beautiful
um yeah plasmas are actually quite uh

2716
00:51:07,609 --> 00:51:07,619
um yeah plasmas are actually quite uh
 

2717
00:51:07,619 --> 00:51:09,349
um yeah plasmas are actually quite uh
astonishing sometimes in their beauty

2718
00:51:09,349 --> 00:51:09,359
astonishing sometimes in their beauty
 

2719
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:11,690
astonishing sometimes in their beauty
actually one of the most amazing forms

2720
00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:11,700
actually one of the most amazing forms
 

2721
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:13,309
actually one of the most amazing forms
of plasma is Lightning by the way which

2722
00:51:13,309 --> 00:51:13,319
of plasma is Lightning by the way which
 

2723
00:51:13,319 --> 00:51:16,130
of plasma is Lightning by the way which
is is instantaneous form of plasma that

2724
00:51:16,130 --> 00:51:16,140
is is instantaneous form of plasma that
 

2725
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:17,750
is is instantaneous form of plasma that
exists on Earth but immediately goes

2726
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:17,760
exists on Earth but immediately goes
 

2727
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,130
exists on Earth but immediately goes
away because everything else around it

2728
00:51:19,130 --> 00:51:19,140
away because everything else around it
 

2729
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:20,470
away because everything else around it
it's at room temperature

2730
00:51:20,470 --> 00:51:20,480
it's at room temperature
 

2731
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,790
it's at room temperature
yeah so there's different requirements

2732
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:22,800
yeah so there's different requirements
 

2733
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:25,190
yeah so there's different requirements
in this so making a plasma takes

2734
00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:25,200
in this so making a plasma takes
 

2735
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:28,069
in this so making a plasma takes
about this but at 10 000 degrees even at

2736
00:51:28,069 --> 00:51:28,079
about this but at 10 000 degrees even at
 

2737
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:30,890
about this but at 10 000 degrees even at
a million degrees there's almost no

2738
00:51:30,890 --> 00:51:30,900
a million degrees there's almost no
 

2739
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:33,349
a million degrees there's almost no
probability of the fusion reactions

2740
00:51:33,349 --> 00:51:33,359
probability of the fusion reactions
 

2741
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:36,049
probability of the fusion reactions
occurring and this is because while the

2742
00:51:36,049 --> 00:51:36,059
occurring and this is because while the
 

2743
00:51:36,059 --> 00:51:38,089
occurring and this is because while the
the charged particles can hit into each

2744
00:51:38,089 --> 00:51:38,099
the charged particles can hit into each
 

2745
00:51:38,099 --> 00:51:40,370
the charged particles can hit into each
other if you go back to the very

2746
00:51:40,370 --> 00:51:40,380
other if you go back to the very
 

2747
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:42,410
other if you go back to the very
beginning of this remember I said oh

2748
00:51:42,410 --> 00:51:42,420
beginning of this remember I said oh
 

2749
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:44,750
beginning of this remember I said oh
these charged particles have to get to

2750
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:44,760
these charged particles have to get to
 

2751
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:47,690
these charged particles have to get to
within distances which are like this

2752
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:47,700
within distances which are like this
 

2753
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:49,970
within distances which are like this
size of a nucleus because of the strong

2754
00:51:49,970 --> 00:51:49,980
size of a nucleus because of the strong
 

2755
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:52,390
size of a nucleus because of the strong
nuclear force well

2756
00:51:52,390 --> 00:51:52,400
nuclear force well
 

2757
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:55,309
nuclear force well
unfortunately as the particles get

2758
00:51:55,309 --> 00:51:55,319
unfortunately as the particles get
 

2759
00:51:55,319 --> 00:51:58,010
unfortunately as the particles get
closer this the repulsion that comes

2760
00:51:58,010 --> 00:51:58,020
closer this the repulsion that comes
 

2761
00:51:58,020 --> 00:52:00,730
closer this the repulsion that comes
from the charge the coulomb force

2762
00:52:00,730 --> 00:52:00,740
from the charge the coulomb force
 

2763
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:03,170
from the charge the coulomb force
increases like the inverse distance

2764
00:52:03,170 --> 00:52:03,180
increases like the inverse distance
 

2765
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:05,630
increases like the inverse distance
squared I don't know so as they get

2766
00:52:05,630 --> 00:52:05,640
squared I don't know so as they get
 

2767
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:08,329
squared I don't know so as they get
closer they're pushing harder and harder

2768
00:52:08,329 --> 00:52:08,339
closer they're pushing harder and harder
 

2769
00:52:08,339 --> 00:52:09,230
closer they're pushing harder and harder
apart

2770
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:09,240
apart
 

2771
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:11,030
apart
so then then it gets a little bit more

2772
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:11,040
so then then it gets a little bit more
 

2773
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,349
so then then it gets a little bit more
exotic which you maybe you'll like

2774
00:52:12,349 --> 00:52:12,359
exotic which you maybe you'll like
 

2775
00:52:12,359 --> 00:52:14,150
exotic which you maybe you'll like
though that it turns out that you people

2776
00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:14,160
though that it turns out that you people
 

2777
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,670
though that it turns out that you people
understood this and um at the beginning

2778
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:16,680
understood this and um at the beginning
 

2779
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:19,849
understood this and um at the beginning
of the uh of of the age of after

2780
00:52:19,849 --> 00:52:19,859
of the uh of of the age of after
 

2781
00:52:19,859 --> 00:52:21,650
of the uh of of the age of after
Rutherford discovered the nucleus it's

2782
00:52:21,650 --> 00:52:21,660
Rutherford discovered the nucleus it's
 

2783
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:23,210
Rutherford discovered the nucleus it's
like oh yeah I was like how are we going

2784
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:23,220
like oh yeah I was like how are we going
 

2785
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:24,890
like oh yeah I was like how are we going
to how's this going to work right

2786
00:52:24,890 --> 00:52:24,900
to how's this going to work right
 

2787
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:26,630
to how's this going to work right
because how do you get anything within

2788
00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:26,640
because how do you get anything within
 

2789
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,870
because how do you get anything within
these distances it's a good inquire

2790
00:52:28,870 --> 00:52:28,880
these distances it's a good inquire
 

2791
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:31,010
these distances it's a good inquire
extraordinary energy and it does and in

2792
00:52:31,010 --> 00:52:31,020
extraordinary energy and it does and in
 

2793
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:32,270
extraordinary energy and it does and in
fact when you look at those energies

2794
00:52:32,270 --> 00:52:32,280
fact when you look at those energies
 

2795
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:34,609
fact when you look at those energies
they're very very high

2796
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:34,619
they're very very high
 

2797
00:52:34,619 --> 00:52:36,349
they're very very high
um but it turns out quantum physics

2798
00:52:36,349 --> 00:52:36,359
um but it turns out quantum physics
 

2799
00:52:36,359 --> 00:52:38,270
um but it turns out quantum physics
comes to the rescue

2800
00:52:38,270 --> 00:52:38,280
comes to the rescue
 

2801
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:41,089
comes to the rescue
because the particles aren't aren't

2802
00:52:41,089 --> 00:52:41,099
because the particles aren't aren't
 

2803
00:52:41,099 --> 00:52:42,829
because the particles aren't aren't
actually just particles they're also

2804
00:52:42,829 --> 00:52:42,839
actually just particles they're also
 

2805
00:52:42,839 --> 00:52:44,930
actually just particles they're also
waves this is the point of quantum right

2806
00:52:44,930 --> 00:52:44,940
waves this is the point of quantum right
 

2807
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:47,030
waves this is the point of quantum right
the you can treat them both as waves and

2808
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:47,040
the you can treat them both as waves and
 

2809
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:50,030
the you can treat them both as waves and
as as particles and it turns out if you

2810
00:52:50,030 --> 00:52:50,040
as as particles and it turns out if you
 

2811
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:51,650
as as particles and it turns out if you
get if they get in close enough

2812
00:52:51,650 --> 00:52:51,660
get if they get in close enough
 

2813
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:55,549
get if they get in close enough
proximity to each other then the

2814
00:52:55,549 --> 00:52:55,559
proximity to each other then the
 

2815
00:52:55,559 --> 00:52:59,089
proximity to each other then the
particle pops through basically this

2816
00:52:59,089 --> 00:52:59,099
particle pops through basically this
 

2817
00:52:59,099 --> 00:53:01,309
particle pops through basically this
energy barrier through an effect called

2818
00:53:01,309 --> 00:53:01,319
energy barrier through an effect called
 

2819
00:53:01,319 --> 00:53:03,650

Quantum tunneling which is really just

2820
00:53:03,650 --> 00:53:03,660
Quantum tunneling which is really just
 

2821
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:05,270
Quantum tunneling which is really just
the transposition of the fact that it's

2822
00:53:05,270 --> 00:53:05,280
the transposition of the fact that it's
 

2823
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,130
the transposition of the fact that it's
a wave so that it has a finite

probability of this it's it's this by
 

2827
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:11,270

the way you talk about like do you have

2828
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:11,280
the way you talk about like do you have
 

2829
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:12,890
the way you talk about like do you have
a hard time like conceptualizing this

2830
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:12,900
a hard time like conceptualizing this
 

2831
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:16,010
a hard time like conceptualizing this
these are this is one of them yeah this

2832
00:53:16,010 --> 00:53:16,020
these are this is one of them yeah this
 

2833
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:18,170
these are this is one of them yeah this
is like throwing a ping-pong ball like

2834
00:53:18,170 --> 00:53:18,180
is like throwing a ping-pong ball like
 

2835
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:20,930
is like throwing a ping-pong ball like
at a a piece of paper and then every

2836
00:53:20,930 --> 00:53:20,940
at a a piece of paper and then every
 

2837
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:22,609
at a a piece of paper and then every
like you know 100 of them just like

2838
00:53:22,609 --> 00:53:22,619
like you know 100 of them just like
 

2839
00:53:22,619 --> 00:53:24,410
like you know 100 of them just like
magically show up on the other side of

2840
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:24,420
magically show up on the other side of
 

2841
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:26,089
magically show up on the other side of
the paper without seemingly breaking the

2842
00:53:26,089 --> 00:53:26,099
the paper without seemingly breaking the
 

2843
00:53:26,099 --> 00:53:28,910
the paper without seemingly breaking the
paper I mean to use a physical analogy

2844
00:53:28,910 --> 00:53:28,920
paper I mean to use a physical analogy
 

2845
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:32,569
paper I mean to use a physical analogy
yeah that's phenomena is important is uh

2846
00:53:32,569 --> 00:53:32,579
yeah that's phenomena is important is uh
 

2847
00:53:32,579 --> 00:53:34,250
yeah that's phenomena is important is uh
critical for the function of nuclear

2848
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:34,260
critical for the function of nuclear
 

2849
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:37,190
critical for the function of nuclear
fusion yeah all kinds of fusions so this

2850
00:53:37,190 --> 00:53:37,200
fusion yeah all kinds of fusions so this
 

2851
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,410
fusion yeah all kinds of fusions so this
this is the reason why Stars can work as

2852
00:53:39,410 --> 00:53:39,420
this is the reason why Stars can work as
 

2853
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:41,690
this is the reason why Stars can work as
well too like the stars would have to be

2854
00:53:41,690 --> 00:53:41,700
well too like the stars would have to be
 

2855
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:43,730
well too like the stars would have to be
much much hotter actually to be able to

2856
00:53:43,730 --> 00:53:43,740
much much hotter actually to be able to
 

2857
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:45,170
much much hotter actually to be able to
in fact it's not clear that they would

2858
00:53:45,170 --> 00:53:45,180
in fact it's not clear that they would
 

2859
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:48,470
in fact it's not clear that they would
actually ignite in fact without this

2860
00:53:48,470 --> 00:53:48,480
actually ignite in fact without this
 

2861
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,990
actually ignite in fact without this
effect and so we get to that so this is

2862
00:53:50,990 --> 00:53:51,000
effect and so we get to that so this is
 

2863
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,150
effect and so we get to that so this is
why there's another requirement it's

2864
00:53:53,150 --> 00:53:53,160
why there's another requirement it's
 

2865
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:55,190
why there's another requirement it's
it's not so you must make a plasma but

2866
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:55,200
it's not so you must make a plasma but
 

2867
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,829
it's not so you must make a plasma but
you also also must get it very hot in

2868
00:53:57,829 --> 00:53:57,839
you also also must get it very hot in
 

2869
00:53:57,839 --> 00:53:59,510
you also also must get it very hot in
order for the reactions to have a

2870
00:53:59,510 --> 00:53:59,520
order for the reactions to have a
 

2871
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:01,370
order for the reactions to have a
significant probability to actually fuse

2872
00:54:01,370 --> 00:54:01,380
significant probability to actually fuse
 

2873
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:03,650
significant probability to actually fuse
and it actually falls effectively almost

2874
00:54:03,650 --> 00:54:03,660
and it actually falls effectively almost
 

2875
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:06,230
and it actually falls effectively almost
to zero for lower temperatures as well

2876
00:54:06,230 --> 00:54:06,240
to zero for lower temperatures as well
 

2877
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:09,650
to zero for lower temperatures as well
too so there's some nice equation yes

2878
00:54:09,650 --> 00:54:09,660
too so there's some nice equation yes
 

2879
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:12,470
too so there's some nice equation yes
that gets you to 50 million degrees

2880
00:54:12,470 --> 00:54:12,480
that gets you to 50 million degrees
 

2881
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:15,650
that gets you to 50 million degrees
or like uh yeah the or that you said

2882
00:54:15,650 --> 00:54:15,660
or like uh yeah the or that you said
 

2883
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:17,569
or like uh yeah the or that you said
practically speaking 100 million so it's

2884
00:54:17,569 --> 00:54:17,579
practically speaking 100 million so it's
 

2885
00:54:17,579 --> 00:54:19,190
practically speaking 100 million so it's
a really simple equation it's the ideal

2886
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:19,200
a really simple equation it's the ideal
 

2887
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,530
a really simple equation it's the ideal
gas law basically almost so it's in the

2888
00:54:21,530 --> 00:54:21,540
gas law basically almost so it's in the
 

2889
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:23,870
gas law basically almost so it's in the
end you've got a certain number of

2890
00:54:23,870 --> 00:54:23,880
end you've got a certain number of
 

2891
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:25,549
end you've got a certain number of
particle of these Fusion particles in

2892
00:54:25,549 --> 00:54:25,559
particle of these Fusion particles in
 

2893
00:54:25,559 --> 00:54:27,109
particle of these Fusion particles in
the plasma state they're in the plasma

2894
00:54:27,109 --> 00:54:27,119
the plasma state they're in the plasma
 

2895
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:28,250
the plasma state they're in the plasma
State there's a certain number of

2896
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:28,260
State there's a certain number of
 

2897
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:30,530
State there's a certain number of
particles and if the confinement is

2898
00:54:30,530 --> 00:54:30,540
particles and if the confinement is
 

2899
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:32,450
particles and if the confinement is
perfect if you put in a certain content

2900
00:54:32,450 --> 00:54:32,460
perfect if you put in a certain content
 

2901
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:34,730
perfect if you put in a certain content
of energy then basically eventually they

2902
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:34,740
of energy then basically eventually they
 

2903
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:37,250
of energy then basically eventually they
just they come up in a temperature and

2904
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:37,260
just they come up in a temperature and
 

2905
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:39,410
just they come up in a temperature and
they become they they go up they go up

2906
00:54:39,410 --> 00:54:39,420
they become they they go up they go up
 

2907
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:41,450
they become they they go up they go up
to high temperature this turns out to be

2908
00:54:41,450 --> 00:54:41,460
to high temperature this turns out to be
 

2909
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:43,970
to high temperature this turns out to be
by the way extraordinarily small amounts

2910
00:54:43,970 --> 00:54:43,980
by the way extraordinarily small amounts
 

2911
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:45,410
by the way extraordinarily small amounts
of energy

2912
00:54:45,410 --> 00:54:45,420
of energy
 

2913
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:47,329
of energy
and you go what it's like I'm getting

2914
00:54:47,329 --> 00:54:47,339
and you go what it's like I'm getting
 

2915
00:54:47,339 --> 00:54:48,950
and you go what it's like I'm getting
something to like 100 million degrees

2916
00:54:48,950 --> 00:54:48,960
something to like 100 million degrees
 

2917
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:51,049
something to like 100 million degrees
that's gonna take the biggest flame

2918
00:54:51,049 --> 00:54:51,059
that's gonna take the biggest flame
 

2919
00:54:51,059 --> 00:54:54,109
that's gonna take the biggest flame
burner that I've ever seen no

2920
00:54:54,109 --> 00:54:54,119
burner that I've ever seen no
 

2921
00:54:54,119 --> 00:54:56,329
burner that I've ever seen no
and the reason for this is it goes back

2922
00:54:56,329 --> 00:54:56,339
and the reason for this is it goes back
 

2923
00:54:56,339 --> 00:54:59,809
and the reason for this is it goes back
to the energy content of of this so yeah

2924
00:54:59,809 --> 00:54:59,819
to the energy content of of this so yeah
 

2925
00:54:59,819 --> 00:55:01,430
to the energy content of of this so yeah
you have to there's you have to get it

2926
00:55:01,430 --> 00:55:01,440
you have to there's you have to get it
 

2927
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:04,370
you have to there's you have to get it
to high average energy but there's very

2928
00:55:04,370 --> 00:55:04,380
to high average energy but there's very
 

2929
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:07,150
to high average energy but there's very
very few particles this is low density

2930
00:55:07,150 --> 00:55:07,160
very few particles this is low density
 

2931
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:10,010
very few particles this is low density
low density in the reactor is this so

2932
00:55:10,010 --> 00:55:10,020
low density in the reactor is this so
 

2933
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:11,569
low density in the reactor is this so
you the way that you do this is

2934
00:55:11,569 --> 00:55:11,579
you the way that you do this is
 

2935
00:55:11,579 --> 00:55:14,089
you the way that you do this is
primarily again this is not exactly true

2936
00:55:14,089 --> 00:55:14,099
primarily again this is not exactly true
 

2937
00:55:14,099 --> 00:55:17,390
primarily again this is not exactly true
in all kinds of fusion but in the in the

2938
00:55:17,390 --> 00:55:17,400
in all kinds of fusion but in the in the
 

2939
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:18,950
in all kinds of fusion but in the in the
primary one that we work on a magnetic

2940
00:55:18,950 --> 00:55:18,960
primary one that we work on a magnetic
 

2941
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,349
primary one that we work on a magnetic
Fusion this is all happening in a hard

2942
00:55:21,349 --> 00:55:21,359
Fusion this is all happening in a hard
 

2943
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:22,910
Fusion this is all happening in a hard
vacuum so it's like it's happening in

2944
00:55:22,910 --> 00:55:22,920
vacuum so it's like it's happening in
 

2945
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:24,650
vacuum so it's like it's happening in
outer space so basically you've gotten

2946
00:55:24,650 --> 00:55:24,660
outer space so basically you've gotten
 

2947
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:26,569
outer space so basically you've gotten
rid of all the other particles except

2948
00:55:26,569 --> 00:55:26,579
rid of all the other particles except
 

2949
00:55:26,579 --> 00:55:30,410
rid of all the other particles except
for these specialized one at a time uh

2950
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:30,420
for these specialized one at a time uh
 

2951
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:32,569
for these specialized one at a time uh
no actually it's even easier than that

2952
00:55:32,569 --> 00:55:32,579
no actually it's even easier than that
 

2953
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:35,270
no actually it's even easier than that
you you connect a gas valve and you

2954
00:55:35,270 --> 00:55:35,280
you you connect a gas valve and you
 

2955
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,309
you you connect a gas valve and you
basically leak gas into it in a

2956
00:55:37,309 --> 00:55:37,319
basically leak gas into it in a
 

2957
00:55:37,319 --> 00:55:39,470
basically leak gas into it in a
controlled fashion yeah yeah well this

2958
00:55:39,470 --> 00:55:39,480
controlled fashion yeah yeah well this
 

2959
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:41,990
controlled fashion yeah yeah well this
is beautiful the gas cylinder how do you

2960
00:55:41,990 --> 00:55:42,000
is beautiful the gas cylinder how do you
 

2961
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,089
is beautiful the gas cylinder how do you
get it from hitting the walls yeah so

2962
00:55:44,089 --> 00:55:44,099
get it from hitting the walls yeah so
 

2963
00:55:44,099 --> 00:55:45,589
get it from hitting the walls yeah so
now you've touched on the other

2964
00:55:45,589 --> 00:55:45,599
now you've touched on the other
 

2965
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:47,270
now you've touched on the other
necessary requirements so it turns out

2966
00:55:47,270 --> 00:55:47,280
necessary requirements so it turns out
 

2967
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:48,650
necessary requirements so it turns out
it's not just temperature that's

2968
00:55:48,650 --> 00:55:48,660
it's not just temperature that's
 

2969
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:51,589
it's not just temperature that's
required you must also confine it

2970
00:55:51,589 --> 00:55:51,599
required you must also confine it
 

2971
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:53,329
required you must also confine it
so what does this mean confine it and

2972
00:55:53,329 --> 00:55:53,339
so what does this mean confine it and
 

2973
00:55:53,339 --> 00:55:54,890
so what does this mean confine it and
there's two types of confinement as you

2974
00:55:54,890 --> 00:55:54,900
there's two types of confinement as you
 

2975
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:56,089
there's two types of confinement as you
mentioned you mentioned the magnetic one

2976
00:55:56,089 --> 00:55:56,099
mentioned you mentioned the magnetic one
 

2977
00:55:56,099 --> 00:55:57,890
mentioned you mentioned the magnetic one
magnetic one and there's another one

2978
00:55:57,890 --> 00:55:57,900
magnetic one and there's another one
 

2979
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:00,470
magnetic one and there's another one
called inertial as well too but the

2980
00:56:00,470 --> 00:56:00,480
called inertial as well too but the
 

2981
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:01,790
called inertial as well too but the
general principle actually has nothing

2982
00:56:01,790 --> 00:56:01,800
general principle actually has nothing
 

2983
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:05,030
general principle actually has nothing
to do with in particular with what your

2984
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:05,040
to do with in particular with what your
 

2985
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:06,890
to do with in particular with what your
what with the technology is that you use

2986
00:56:06,890 --> 00:56:06,900
what with the technology is that you use
 

2987
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:09,710
what with the technology is that you use
to confine it it's because

2988
00:56:09,710 --> 00:56:09,720
to confine it it's because
 

2989
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:11,990
to confine it it's because
this goes back to the fact that the

2990
00:56:11,990 --> 00:56:12,000
this goes back to the fact that the
 

2991
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,210
this goes back to the fact that the
requirement in this is high temperature

2992
00:56:14,210 --> 00:56:14,220
requirement in this is high temperature
 

2993
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:16,430
requirement in this is high temperature
and thermal content so it's like

2994
00:56:16,430 --> 00:56:16,440
and thermal content so it's like
 

2995
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:19,609
and thermal content so it's like
Building A Fire Man and what this means

2996
00:56:19,609 --> 00:56:19,619
Building A Fire Man and what this means
 

2997
00:56:19,619 --> 00:56:21,950
Building A Fire Man and what this means
is that if you when you release the

2998
00:56:21,950 --> 00:56:21,960
is that if you when you release the
 

2999
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:25,130
is that if you when you release the
energy into this or or apply heat to

3000
00:56:25,130 --> 00:56:25,140
energy into this or or apply heat to
 

3001
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:27,710
energy into this or or apply heat to
this if it just instantly leaks out it

3002
00:56:27,710 --> 00:56:27,720
this if it just instantly leaks out it
 

3003
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:29,750
this if it just instantly leaks out it
can never get hot right so you're

3004
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:29,760
can never get hot right so you're
 

3005
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,130
can never get hot right so you're
familiar with this it's like you've got

3006
00:56:31,130 --> 00:56:31,140
familiar with this it's like you've got
 

3007
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:32,809
familiar with this it's like you've got
something that you're you're trying to

3008
00:56:32,809 --> 00:56:32,819
something that you're you're trying to
 

3009
00:56:32,819 --> 00:56:34,849
something that you're you're trying to
apply heat to but you're just throwing

3010
00:56:34,849 --> 00:56:34,859
apply heat to but you're just throwing
 

3011
00:56:34,859 --> 00:56:36,829
apply heat to but you're just throwing
the heat away very quickly this is why

3012
00:56:36,829 --> 00:56:36,839
the heat away very quickly this is why
 

3013
00:56:36,839 --> 00:56:38,510
the heat away very quickly this is why
we insulate homes by the way and things

3014
00:56:38,510 --> 00:56:38,520
we insulate homes by the way and things
 

3015
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:39,890
we insulate homes by the way and things
like those right it's like you don't

3016
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:39,900
like those right it's like you don't
 

3017
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:41,390
like those right it's like you don't
want the heat that's coming into this

3018
00:56:41,390 --> 00:56:41,400
want the heat that's coming into this
 

3019
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:43,370
want the heat that's coming into this
room to just immediately leave because

3020
00:56:43,370 --> 00:56:43,380
room to just immediately leave because
 

3021
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:45,049
room to just immediately leave because
you'll just start consuming infinite

3022
00:56:45,049 --> 00:56:45,059
you'll just start consuming infinite
 

3023
00:56:45,059 --> 00:56:47,450
you'll just start consuming infinite
amounts of heat to try to keep it hot so

3024
00:56:47,450 --> 00:56:47,460
amounts of heat to try to keep it hot so
 

3025
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:48,589
amounts of heat to try to keep it hot so
in the end this is one of the

3026
00:56:48,589 --> 00:56:48,599
in the end this is one of the
 

3027
00:56:48,599 --> 00:56:50,630
in the end this is one of the
requirements and it actually has a name

3028
00:56:50,630 --> 00:56:50,640
requirements and it actually has a name
 

3029
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:53,270
requirements and it actually has a name
we call the energy confinement time so

3030
00:56:53,270 --> 00:56:53,280
we call the energy confinement time so
 

3031
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:54,829
we call the energy confinement time so
this means if you release a certain

3032
00:56:54,829 --> 00:56:54,839
this means if you release a certain
 

3033
00:56:54,839 --> 00:56:57,650
this means if you release a certain
amount of energy into this fuel

3034
00:56:57,650 --> 00:56:57,660
amount of energy into this fuel
 

3035
00:56:57,660 --> 00:56:59,630
amount of energy into this fuel
um kind of how long you sit there and

3036
00:56:59,630 --> 00:56:59,640
um kind of how long you sit there and
 

3037
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:01,309
um kind of how long you sit there and
you look at your watch how long does it

3038
00:57:01,309 --> 00:57:01,319
you look at your watch how long does it
 

3039
00:57:01,319 --> 00:57:03,170
you look at your watch how long does it
take for this energy to like leave the

3040
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:03,180
take for this energy to like leave the
 

3041
00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:04,790
take for this energy to like leave the
system so you could imagine that in this

3042
00:57:04,790 --> 00:57:04,800
system so you could imagine that in this
 

3043
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:06,770
system so you could imagine that in this
room that you know these heaters are

3044
00:57:06,770 --> 00:57:06,780
room that you know these heaters are
 

3045
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:08,390
room that you know these heaters are
putting energy into the air in this room

3046
00:57:08,390 --> 00:57:08,400
putting energy into the air in this room
 

3047
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,790
putting energy into the air in this room
and you waited for a day a but all the

3048
00:57:10,790 --> 00:57:10,800
and you waited for a day a but all the
 

3049
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:12,589
and you waited for a day a but all the
Heat have gone to outside if I open up

3050
00:57:12,589 --> 00:57:12,599
Heat have gone to outside if I open up
 

3051
00:57:12,599 --> 00:57:13,670
Heat have gone to outside if I open up
the windows oh there that's energy

3052
00:57:13,670 --> 00:57:13,680
the windows oh there that's energy
 

3053
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,410
the windows oh there that's energy
confinement time okay so it's the same

3054
00:57:15,410 --> 00:57:15,420
confinement time okay so it's the same
 

3055
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:18,230
confinement time okay so it's the same
concept as that so this is an important

3056
00:57:18,230 --> 00:57:18,240
concept as that so this is an important
 

3057
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:20,530
concept as that so this is an important
one so all Fusion must have confinement

3058
00:57:20,530 --> 00:57:20,540
one so all Fusion must have confinement
 

3059
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:23,450
one so all Fusion must have confinement
uh there's another more esoteric reason

3060
00:57:23,450 --> 00:57:23,460
uh there's another more esoteric reason
 

3061
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:26,329
uh there's another more esoteric reason
for this which is that people often

3062
00:57:26,329 --> 00:57:26,339
for this which is that people often
 

3063
00:57:26,339 --> 00:57:28,970
for this which is that people often
confuse temperature and energy

3064
00:57:28,970 --> 00:57:28,980
confuse temperature and energy
 

3065
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:30,770
confuse temperature and energy
so what I mean by that so this is

3066
00:57:30,770 --> 00:57:30,780
so what I mean by that so this is
 

3067
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:33,109
so what I mean by that so this is
literally a temperature which means that

3068
00:57:33,109 --> 00:57:33,119
literally a temperature which means that
 

3069
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:35,750
literally a temperature which means that
it is a system in which all the

3070
00:57:35,750 --> 00:57:35,760
it is a system in which all the
 

3071
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:38,089
it is a system in which all the
particles every particle has high

3072
00:57:38,089 --> 00:57:38,099
particles every particle has high
 

3073
00:57:38,099 --> 00:57:41,089
particles every particle has high
kinetic energy and is actually in a

3074
00:57:41,089 --> 00:57:41,099
kinetic energy and is actually in a
 

3075
00:57:41,099 --> 00:57:43,370
kinetic energy and is actually in a
fully relaxed State namely that entropy

3076
00:57:43,370 --> 00:57:43,380
fully relaxed State namely that entropy
 

3077
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:44,750
fully relaxed State namely that entropy
has been maximized and it gets a little

3078
00:57:44,750 --> 00:57:44,760
has been maximized and it gets a little
 

3079
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:46,549
has been maximized and it gets a little
bit more technical but this means that

3080
00:57:46,549 --> 00:57:46,559
bit more technical but this means that
 

3081
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:48,770
bit more technical but this means that
basically it is it is a thermal system

3082
00:57:48,770 --> 00:57:48,780
basically it is it is a thermal system
 

3083
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:50,210
basically it is it is a thermal system
so it's like the air in this room it's

3084
00:57:50,210 --> 00:57:50,220
so it's like the air in this room it's
 

3085
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:52,069
so it's like the air in this room it's
like the water it's the water in this

3086
00:57:52,069 --> 00:57:52,079
like the water it's the water in this
 

3087
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:54,530
like the water it's the water in this
these all have temperatures which means

3088
00:57:54,530 --> 00:57:54,540
these all have temperatures which means
 

3089
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:55,790
these all have temperatures which means
that there's a distribution of those

3090
00:57:55,790 --> 00:57:55,800
that there's a distribution of those
 

3091
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:56,990
that there's a distribution of those
energies because the particles have

3092
00:57:56,990 --> 00:57:57,000
energies because the particles have
 

3093
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,270
energies because the particles have
collided so much that it's there so we

3094
00:57:59,270 --> 00:57:59,280
collided so much that it's there so we
 

3095
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:01,849
collided so much that it's there so we
this is distinguished from having high

3096
00:58:01,849 --> 00:58:01,859
this is distinguished from having high
 

3097
00:58:01,859 --> 00:58:03,770
this is distinguished from having high
energy particles like what we have in

3098
00:58:03,770 --> 00:58:03,780
energy particles like what we have in
 

3099
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:05,569
energy particles like what we have in
like particle accelerators like CERN and

3100
00:58:05,569 --> 00:58:05,579
like particle accelerators like CERN and
 

3101
00:58:05,579 --> 00:58:09,230
like particle accelerators like CERN and
so forth those are high kinetic energy

3102
00:58:09,230 --> 00:58:09,240
so forth those are high kinetic energy
 

3103
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:10,910
so forth those are high kinetic energy
but it's not a temperature so it

3104
00:58:10,910 --> 00:58:10,920
but it's not a temperature so it
 

3105
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:12,829
but it's not a temperature so it
actually doesn't count as confinement so

3106
00:58:12,829 --> 00:58:12,839
actually doesn't count as confinement so
 

3107
00:58:12,839 --> 00:58:14,450
actually doesn't count as confinement so
we go through all of those you have

3108
00:58:14,450 --> 00:58:14,460
we go through all of those you have
 

3109
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:15,710
we go through all of those you have
temperature

3110
00:58:15,710 --> 00:58:15,720
temperature
 

3111
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:17,569
temperature
um and then the other requirement not

3112
00:58:17,569 --> 00:58:17,579
um and then the other requirement not
 

3113
00:58:17,579 --> 00:58:19,370
um and then the other requirement not
too surprising is actually that there

3114
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:19,380
too surprising is actually that there
 

3115
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:22,609
too surprising is actually that there
has to be enough density of the fuel

3116
00:58:22,609 --> 00:58:22,619
has to be enough density of the fuel
 

3117
00:58:22,619 --> 00:58:25,250
has to be enough density of the fuel
enough but enough but not too much yes

3118
00:58:25,250 --> 00:58:25,260
enough but enough but not too much yes
 

3119
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:28,010
enough but enough but not too much yes
and so in the end

3120
00:58:28,010 --> 00:58:28,020
and so in the end
 

3121
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:29,870
and so in the end
um the way that it there's a fancy name

3122
00:58:29,870 --> 00:58:29,880
um the way that it there's a fancy name
 

3123
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:31,490
um the way that it there's a fancy name
for it it's called The Lawson Criterion

3124
00:58:31,490 --> 00:58:31,500
for it it's called The Lawson Criterion
 

3125
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:33,890
for it it's called The Lawson Criterion
because it was it was it was formulated

3126
00:58:33,890 --> 00:58:33,900
because it was it was it was formulated
 

3127
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:36,049
because it was it was it was formulated
by scientists in the United Kingdom

3128
00:58:36,049 --> 00:58:36,059
by scientists in the United Kingdom
 

3129
00:58:36,059 --> 00:58:40,069
by scientists in the United Kingdom
about 1956 or 1957 and this was

3130
00:58:40,069 --> 00:58:40,079
about 1956 or 1957 and this was
 

3131
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:42,170
about 1956 or 1957 and this was
essentially the realization of oh this

3132
00:58:42,170 --> 00:58:42,180
essentially the realization of oh this
 

3133
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:43,789
essentially the realization of oh this
is what it's going to take regardless of

3134
00:58:43,789 --> 00:58:43,799
is what it's going to take regardless of
 

3135
00:58:43,799 --> 00:58:46,549
is what it's going to take regardless of
the confinement method these are this is

3136
00:58:46,549 --> 00:58:46,559
the confinement method these are this is
 

3137
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:48,470
the confinement method these are this is
the basic what it is actually Power

3138
00:58:48,470 --> 00:58:48,480
the basic what it is actually Power
 

3139
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:50,809
the basic what it is actually Power
Balance it just says oh there's a

3140
00:58:50,809 --> 00:58:50,819
Balance it just says oh there's a
 

3141
00:58:50,819 --> 00:58:52,609
Balance it just says oh there's a
certain amount of heat coming in which

3142
00:58:52,609 --> 00:58:52,619
certain amount of heat coming in which
 

3143
00:58:52,619 --> 00:58:53,990
certain amount of heat coming in which
is coming from the fusion reaction

3144
00:58:53,990 --> 00:58:54,000
is coming from the fusion reaction
 

3145
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,450
is coming from the fusion reaction
itself because the fusion reaction heats

3146
00:58:56,450 --> 00:58:56,460
itself because the fusion reaction heats
 

3147
00:58:56,460 --> 00:58:59,750
itself because the fusion reaction heats
the fuel versus how fast you would lose

3148
00:58:59,750 --> 00:58:59,760
the fuel versus how fast you would lose
 

3149
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:02,450
the fuel versus how fast you would lose
it and it basically summarizes

3150
00:59:02,450 --> 00:59:02,460
it and it basically summarizes
 

3151
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:04,309
it and it basically summarizes
summarized by those three parameters

3152
00:59:04,309 --> 00:59:04,319
summarized by those three parameters
 

3153
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:06,430
summarized by those three parameters
which are fairly simple so temperature

3154
00:59:06,430 --> 00:59:06,440
which are fairly simple so temperature
 

3155
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:09,230
which are fairly simple so temperature
and then the reason we say 100 million

3156
00:59:09,230 --> 00:59:09,240
and then the reason we say 100 million
 

3157
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:12,950
and then the reason we say 100 million
degrees is because almost always in in

3158
00:59:12,950 --> 00:59:12,960
degrees is because almost always in in
 

3159
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:14,569
degrees is because almost always in in
for for this kind of fusion deuterium

3160
00:59:14,569 --> 00:59:14,579
for for this kind of fusion deuterium
 

3161
00:59:14,579 --> 00:59:16,430
for for this kind of fusion deuterium
tritium Fusion the minimum in the

3162
00:59:16,430 --> 00:59:16,440
tritium Fusion the minimum in the
 

3163
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:18,410
tritium Fusion the minimum in the
density and the confinement time product

3164
00:59:18,410 --> 00:59:18,420
density and the confinement time product
 

3165
00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:20,150
density and the confinement time product
is at about 100 million so you almost

3166
00:59:20,150 --> 00:59:20,160
is at about 100 million so you almost
 

3167
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,549
is at about 100 million so you almost
always design your device around that

3168
00:59:22,549 --> 00:59:22,559
always design your device around that
 

3169
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:24,410
always design your device around that
minimum and then you try to get it

3170
00:59:24,410 --> 00:59:24,420
minimum and then you try to get it
 

3171
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:26,390
minimum and then you try to get it
contained well enough and you try to get

3172
00:59:26,390 --> 00:59:26,400
contained well enough and you try to get
 

3173
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,910
contained well enough and you try to get
enough density so you know so that

3174
00:59:28,910 --> 00:59:28,920
enough density so you know so that
 

3175
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:31,190
enough density so you know so that
temperature thing sounds crazy right

3176
00:59:31,190 --> 00:59:31,200
temperature thing sounds crazy right
 

3177
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,930
temperature thing sounds crazy right
that's what we've actually achieved in

3178
00:59:32,930 --> 00:59:32,940
that's what we've actually achieved in
 

3179
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:34,670
that's what we've actually achieved in
the laboratory like our experiment here

3180
00:59:34,670 --> 00:59:34,680
the laboratory like our experiment here
 

3181
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:37,010
the laboratory like our experiment here
at MIT when it ran it's Optimum

3182
00:59:37,010 --> 00:59:37,020
at MIT when it ran it's Optimum
 

3183
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:39,349
at MIT when it ran it's Optimum
configuration it was at 100 million

3184
00:59:39,349 --> 00:59:39,359
configuration it was at 100 million
 

3185
00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:40,309
configuration it was at 100 million
degrees

3186
00:59:40,309 --> 00:59:40,319
degrees
 

3187
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:42,470
degrees
but it wasn't actually the the product

3188
00:59:42,470 --> 00:59:42,480
but it wasn't actually the the product
 

3189
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,510
but it wasn't actually the the product
of the density in the confinement time

3190
00:59:44,510 --> 00:59:44,520
of the density in the confinement time
 

3191
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:46,370
of the density in the confinement time
wasn't sufficient that we were at a

3192
00:59:46,370 --> 00:59:46,380
wasn't sufficient that we were at a
 

3193
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:47,990
wasn't sufficient that we were at a
place that we were getting high net

3194
00:59:47,990 --> 00:59:48,000
place that we were getting high net
 

3195
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,390
place that we were getting high net
energy gain but it was making Fusion

3196
00:59:50,390 --> 00:59:50,400
energy gain but it was making Fusion
 

3197
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,789
energy gain but it was making Fusion
reactions so this is the sequence that

3198
00:59:52,789 --> 00:59:52,799
reactions so this is the sequence that
 

3199
00:59:52,799 --> 00:59:54,890
reactions so this is the sequence that
you go through make a plasma then you

3200
00:59:54,890 --> 00:59:54,900
you go through make a plasma then you
 

3201
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:56,930
you go through make a plasma then you
get it hot enough and when you get it

3202
00:59:56,930 --> 00:59:56,940
get it hot enough and when you get it
 

3203
00:59:56,940 --> 00:59:58,549
get it hot enough and when you get it
hot enough the fusion reactions start

3204
00:59:58,549 --> 00:59:58,559
hot enough the fusion reactions start
 

3205
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:01,069
hot enough the fusion reactions start
happening so rapidly that it's

3206
01:00:01,069 --> 01:00:01,079
happening so rapidly that it's
 

3207
01:00:01,079 --> 01:00:03,109
happening so rapidly that it's
overcoming the the rate at which it's

3208
01:00:03,109 --> 01:00:03,119
overcoming the the rate at which it's
 

3209
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:05,329
overcoming the the rate at which it's
leaking heat to the outside world and at

3210
01:00:05,329 --> 01:00:05,339
leaking heat to the outside world and at
 

3211
01:00:05,339 --> 01:00:07,490
leaking heat to the outside world and at
some point it just becomes like a star

3212
01:00:07,490 --> 01:00:07,500
some point it just becomes like a star
 

3213
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:10,910
some point it just becomes like a star
like a sun and our own our own son and a

3214
01:00:10,910 --> 01:00:10,920
like a sun and our own our own son and a
 

3215
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:12,170
like a sun and our own our own son and a
star doesn't have anything plugged into

3216
01:00:12,170 --> 01:00:12,180
star doesn't have anything plugged into
 

3217
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:13,849
star doesn't have anything plugged into
it it's just keeping itself hot through

3218
01:00:13,849 --> 01:00:13,859
it it's just keeping itself hot through
 

3219
01:00:13,859 --> 01:00:15,650
it it's just keeping itself hot through
its own Fusion reactions in the end

3220
01:00:15,650 --> 01:00:15,660
its own Fusion reactions in the end
 

3221
01:00:15,660 --> 01:00:17,150
its own Fusion reactions in the end
that's really close to what a fusion

3222
01:00:17,150 --> 01:00:17,160
that's really close to what a fusion
 

3223
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:18,589
that's really close to what a fusion
power plant would look like what does it

3224
01:00:18,589 --> 01:00:18,599
power plant would look like what does it
 

3225
01:00:18,599 --> 01:00:20,329
power plant would look like what does it
visually look like does it does it look

3226
01:00:20,329 --> 01:00:20,339
visually look like does it does it look
 

3227
01:00:20,339 --> 01:00:22,250
visually look like does it does it look
like like you said like purple plasma

3228
01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:22,260
like like you said like purple plasma
 

3229
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:24,109
like like you said like purple plasma
you know yeah actually it's it's

3230
01:00:24,109 --> 01:00:24,119
you know yeah actually it's it's
 

3231
01:00:24,119 --> 01:00:25,970
you know yeah actually it's it's
invisible to the eye because it's so hot

3232
01:00:25,970 --> 01:00:25,980
invisible to the eye because it's so hot
 

3233
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:28,250
invisible to the eye because it's so hot
that it's basically emitting light in

3234
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:28,260
that it's basically emitting light in
 

3235
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:30,410
that it's basically emitting light in
frequencies that we can't detect

3236
01:00:30,410 --> 01:00:30,420
frequencies that we can't detect
 

3237
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:32,650
frequencies that we can't detect
it's literally it's invisible

3238
01:00:32,650 --> 01:00:32,660
it's literally it's invisible
 

3239
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:35,210
it's literally it's invisible
in fact light goes through it visible

3240
01:00:35,210 --> 01:00:35,220
in fact light goes through it visible
 

3241
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:36,710
in fact light goes through it visible
light goes through it so easy that if

3242
01:00:36,710 --> 01:00:36,720
light goes through it so easy that if
 

3243
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:38,030
light goes through it so easy that if
you were to look at it what you would

3244
01:00:38,030 --> 01:00:38,040
you were to look at it what you would
 

3245
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:38,930
you were to look at it what you would
see

3246
01:00:38,930 --> 01:00:38,940
see
 

3247
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:40,849
see
in in our own particular configuration

3248
01:00:40,849 --> 01:00:40,859
in in our own particular configuration
 

3249
01:00:40,859 --> 01:00:42,650
in in our own particular configuration
what we make is in the end is a donut

3250
01:00:42,650 --> 01:00:42,660
what we make is in the end is a donut
 

3251
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:45,349
what we make is in the end is a donut
shaped um it's a vacuum vessel to keep

3252
01:00:45,349 --> 01:00:45,359
shaped um it's a vacuum vessel to keep
 

3253
01:00:45,359 --> 01:00:47,690
shaped um it's a vacuum vessel to keep
the air out of it and when you in when

3254
01:00:47,690 --> 01:00:47,700
the air out of it and when you in when
 

3255
01:00:47,700 --> 01:00:49,849
the air out of it and when you in when
you turn on the plasma it gets so hot

3256
01:00:49,849 --> 01:00:49,859
you turn on the plasma it gets so hot
 

3257
01:00:49,859 --> 01:00:51,890
you turn on the plasma it gets so hot
that most of it just disappears in the

3258
01:00:51,890 --> 01:00:51,900
that most of it just disappears in the
 

3259
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:53,510
that most of it just disappears in the
visible spectrum you can't see anything

3260
01:00:53,510 --> 01:00:53,520
visible spectrum you can't see anything
 

3261
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:57,049
visible spectrum you can't see anything
and there's very very cold plasma which

3262
01:00:57,049 --> 01:00:57,059
and there's very very cold plasma which
 

3263
01:00:57,059 --> 01:00:59,870
and there's very very cold plasma which
is between 10 and 100 000 degrees which

3264
01:00:59,870 --> 01:00:59,880
is between 10 and 100 000 degrees which
 

3265
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:01,910
is between 10 and 100 000 degrees which
is out in the very periphery of it which

3266
01:01:01,910 --> 01:01:01,920
is out in the very periphery of it which
 

3267
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:04,370
is out in the very periphery of it which
is kind of so the very cold plasma is

3268
01:01:04,370 --> 01:01:04,380
is kind of so the very cold plasma is
 

3269
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:07,130
is kind of so the very cold plasma is
allowed to interact with the kind of has

3270
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:07,140
allowed to interact with the kind of has
 

3271
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:08,569
allowed to interact with the kind of has
to interact with something eventually at

3272
01:01:08,569 --> 01:01:08,579
to interact with something eventually at
 

3273
01:01:08,579 --> 01:01:10,549
to interact with something eventually at
the boundary of the vacuum vessel and

3274
01:01:10,549 --> 01:01:10,559
the boundary of the vacuum vessel and
 

3275
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:12,049
the boundary of the vacuum vessel and
this kind of makes a little halo around

3276
01:01:12,049 --> 01:01:12,059
this kind of makes a little halo around
 

3277
01:01:12,059 --> 01:01:13,970
this kind of makes a little halo around
it and it glows this beautiful purple

3278
01:01:13,970 --> 01:01:13,980
it and it glows this beautiful purple
 

3279
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:17,210
it and it glows this beautiful purple
light basically and these are that's the

3280
01:01:17,210 --> 01:01:17,220
light basically and these are that's the
 

3281
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:18,950
light basically and these are that's the
um that's the that's what we can sense

3282
01:01:18,950 --> 01:01:18,960
um that's the that's what we can sense
 

3283
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:21,650
um that's the that's what we can sense
in the human Spectrum yeah I I remember

3284
01:01:21,650 --> 01:01:21,660
in the human Spectrum yeah I I remember
 

3285
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:24,109
in the human Spectrum yeah I I remember

uh which people should check out it's

3290
01:01:27,109 --> 01:01:27,119
uh which people should check out it's
 

3291
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:28,730
uh which people should check out it's

01:01:30,650 --> 01:01:30,660
that strike you while you're in the
 

3295
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:33,370
that strike you while you're in the
shower and one of them was it's lucky

that a fire when it burns communicates

3298
01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:37,680
that a fire when it burns communicates
 

3299
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:39,410
that a fire when it burns communicates
that it's hot using visible light

3300
01:01:39,410 --> 01:01:39,420
that it's hot using visible light
 

3301
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:42,650
that it's hot using visible light
otherwise humans would be screwed

um I don't know if there's a deep

3304
01:01:43,609 --> 01:01:43,619
um I don't know if there's a deep
 

3305
01:01:43,619 --> 01:01:45,410
um I don't know if there's a deep
profound truth to that but nevertheless

3306
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:45,420
profound truth to that but nevertheless
 

3307
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:46,910
profound truth to that but nevertheless
I did find it on shower thought

3308
01:01:46,910 --> 01:01:46,920
I did find it on shower thought
 

3309
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:50,089
I did find it on shower thought
subreddit actually I do have there this

3310
01:01:50,089 --> 01:01:50,099
subreddit actually I do have there this
 

3311
01:01:50,099 --> 01:01:51,650

goes off in a bit of it you're right

3312
01:01:51,650 --> 01:01:51,660
goes off in a bit of it you're right
 

3313
01:01:51,660 --> 01:01:52,910
goes off in a bit of it you're right
this is actually it's interesting

3314
01:01:52,910 --> 01:01:52,920
this is actually it's interesting
 

3315
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:55,130
this is actually it's interesting
because you know as a scientist you also

3316
01:01:55,130 --> 01:01:55,140
because you know as a scientist you also
 

3317
01:01:55,140 --> 01:01:56,930
because you know as a scientist you also
think about evolutionary functions and

3318
01:01:56,930 --> 01:01:56,940
think about evolutionary functions and
 

3319
01:01:56,940 --> 01:01:58,430
think about evolutionary functions and
how we got like why do we have the

3320
01:01:58,430 --> 01:01:58,440
how we got like why do we have the
 

3321
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:00,109
how we got like why do we have the
senses that we do yes interesting

3322
01:02:00,109 --> 01:02:00,119
senses that we do yes interesting
 

3323
01:02:00,119 --> 01:02:02,329
senses that we do yes interesting
question right like why can bees see an

3324
01:02:02,329 --> 01:02:02,339
question right like why can bees see an
 

3325
01:02:02,339 --> 01:02:04,430
question right like why can bees see an
UltraViolet and we can't then you go

3326
01:02:04,430 --> 01:02:04,440
UltraViolet and we can't then you go
 

3327
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:05,750
UltraViolet and we can't then you go
well it's natural selection for some

3328
01:02:05,750 --> 01:02:05,760
well it's natural selection for some
 

3329
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:07,309
well it's natural selection for some
reason this wasn't really particularly

3330
01:02:07,309 --> 01:02:07,319
reason this wasn't really particularly
 

3331
01:02:07,319 --> 01:02:09,109
reason this wasn't really particularly
important to us right why can't we see

3332
01:02:09,109 --> 01:02:09,119
important to us right why can't we see
 

3333
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:10,609
important to us right why can't we see
in the infrared and other things can

3334
01:02:10,609 --> 01:02:10,619
in the infrared and other things can
 

3335
01:02:10,619 --> 01:02:12,349
in the infrared and other things can
it's like um

3336
01:02:12,349 --> 01:02:12,359
it's like um
 

3337
01:02:12,359 --> 01:02:14,569
it's like um
because the people that could it's a

3338
01:02:14,569 --> 01:02:14,579
because the people that could it's a
 

3339
01:02:14,579 --> 01:02:15,950
because the people that could it's a
fascinating question right obviously

3340
01:02:15,950 --> 01:02:15,960
fascinating question right obviously
 

3341
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:17,510
fascinating question right obviously
there's some there's some advantage that

3342
01:02:17,510 --> 01:02:17,520
there's some there's some advantage that
 

3343
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:19,370
there's some there's some advantage that
you have there that isn't there and even

3344
01:02:19,370 --> 01:02:19,380
you have there that isn't there and even
 

3345
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:21,230
you have there that isn't there and even
color distinguishing right of something

be uh I actually go back to this because

3350
01:02:25,309 --> 01:02:25,319
be uh I actually go back to this because
 

3351
01:02:25,319 --> 01:02:26,930
be uh I actually go back to this because
it's something like that I tell all of

3352
01:02:26,930 --> 01:02:26,940
it's something like that I tell all of
 

3353
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:29,690
it's something like that I tell all of
my my students when I'm teaching

01:02:29,690 --> 01:02:29,700
my my students when I'm teaching
 

3355
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:31,849

01:02:31,849 --> 01:02:31,859
um ionizing radiation and radiological
 

3357
01:02:31,859 --> 01:02:34,069
um ionizing radiation and radiological
safety whatever you say there's a

3358
01:02:34,069 --> 01:02:34,079
safety whatever you say there's a
 

3359
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:37,010
safety whatever you say there's a
cultural concern or that when people

3360
01:02:37,010 --> 01:02:37,020
cultural concern or that when people
 

3361
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:38,930
cultural concern or that when people
hear the word radiation like what does

3362
01:02:38,930 --> 01:02:38,940
hear the word radiation like what does
 

3363
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:40,910
hear the word radiation like what does
this mean it literally just means light

3364
01:02:40,910 --> 01:02:40,920
this mean it literally just means light
 

3365
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:43,910
this mean it literally just means light
is what it means right but it's light in

3366
01:02:43,910 --> 01:02:43,920
is what it means right but it's light in
 

3367
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:46,010
is what it means right but it's light in
different parts of the spectrum right

3368
01:02:46,010 --> 01:02:46,020
different parts of the spectrum right
 

3369
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:49,010
different parts of the spectrum right
and so it turns out besides the visible

3370
01:02:49,010 --> 01:02:49,020
and so it turns out besides the visible
 

3371
01:02:49,020 --> 01:02:50,750
and so it turns out besides the visible
light that we can see here we are

3372
01:02:50,750 --> 01:02:50,760
light that we can see here we are
 

3373
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:53,630

electromagnetic spectrum there is
 

3377
01:02:55,859 --> 01:02:57,530
electromagnetic spectrum there is
visible light there's infrared light

3378
01:02:57,530 --> 01:02:57,540
visible light there's infrared light

01:03:01,619 --> 01:03:04,069
that's how our cell phone works you
can't it's way past our detection

3384
01:03:04,069 --> 01:03:04,079
can't it's way past our detection
 

3385
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:06,829
can't it's way past our detection
capability but also higher energy ones

3386
01:03:06,829 --> 01:03:06,839
capability but also higher energy ones
 

3387
01:03:06,839 --> 01:03:08,390
capability but also higher energy ones
which have to do with ultraviolet light

3388
01:03:08,390 --> 01:03:08,400
which have to do with ultraviolet light

how you get a sunburn

3390
01:03:11,210 --> 01:03:11,220
how you get a sunburn
 

3391
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:13,010
how you get a sunburn
um and even X-rays and things like this

3392
01:03:13,010 --> 01:03:13,020
um and even X-rays and things like this
 

3393
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:15,109
um and even X-rays and things like this
at small levels are continually being

like from the concrete in this in the
 

3397
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:19,069
like from the concrete in this in the
walls of this hotel there's x-rays

01:03:19,079 --> 01:03:21,289
walls of this hotel there's x-rays
hitting our body continuously I can

3400
01:03:21,289 --> 01:03:21,299
hitting our body continuously I can
 

3401
01:03:21,299 --> 01:03:22,910
hitting our body continuously I can
bring out we can go down to the lab at

3402
01:03:22,910 --> 01:03:22,920
bring out we can go down to the lab at
 

3403
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:24,470
bring out we can go down to the lab at
MIT can bring out a detector and show

3404
01:03:24,470 --> 01:03:24,480
MIT can bring out a detector and show
 

3405
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:26,690
MIT can bring out a detector and show
you every single room will have and have

3406
01:03:26,690 --> 01:03:26,700
you every single room will have and have
 

3407
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:28,490
you every single room will have and have
these by our body you mean the 10 to the

3408
01:03:28,490 --> 01:03:28,500
these by our body you mean the 10 to the
 

3409
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:30,950
these by our body you mean the 10 to the
28 atoms yeah the 10 to the 28 atoms and

3410
01:03:30,950 --> 01:03:30,960
28 atoms yeah the 10 to the 28 atoms and
 

3411
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:31,789
28 atoms yeah the 10 to the 28 atoms and
they're coming in and they're

3412
01:03:31,789 --> 01:03:31,799
they're coming in and they're
 

3413
01:03:31,799 --> 01:03:33,950
they're coming in and they're
interacting with those things and those

3414
01:03:33,950 --> 01:03:33,960
interacting with those things and those
 

3415
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:35,690
interacting with those things and those
particularly the ones where the light is

3416
01:03:35,690 --> 01:03:35,700
particularly the ones where the light is
 

3417
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:38,569
particularly the ones where the light is
at higher average energy per per light

3418
01:03:38,569 --> 01:03:38,579
at higher average energy per per light
 

3419
01:03:38,579 --> 01:03:40,849
at higher average energy per per light
particle those are the ones that can

3420
01:03:40,849 --> 01:03:40,859
particle those are the ones that can
 

3421
01:03:40,859 --> 01:03:42,829
particle those are the ones that can
possibly have an effect on human health

3422
01:03:42,829 --> 01:03:42,839
possibly have an effect on human health
 

3423
01:03:42,839 --> 01:03:45,710
possibly have an effect on human health
so we we have it's interesting humans

3424
01:03:45,710 --> 01:03:45,720
so we we have it's interesting humans
 

3425
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:47,450
so we we have it's interesting humans
and all animals of

3426
01:03:47,450 --> 01:03:47,460
and all animals of
 

3427
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:50,030
and all animals of
evolved on Earth where we're immersed in

3428
01:03:50,030 --> 01:03:50,040
evolved on Earth where we're immersed in
 

3429
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:52,190
evolved on Earth where we're immersed in
that all the time yeah there's natural

3430
01:03:52,190 --> 01:03:52,200
that all the time yeah there's natural
 

3431
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:54,109
that all the time yeah there's natural
sources of radiation all the time yet we

3432
01:03:54,109 --> 01:03:54,119
sources of radiation all the time yet we
 

3433
01:03:54,119 --> 01:03:57,109
sources of radiation all the time yet we
have zero ability to detect it like zero

3434
01:03:57,109 --> 01:03:57,119
have zero ability to detect it like zero
 

3435
01:03:57,119 --> 01:03:59,450
have zero ability to detect it like zero
yeah and our ability cognitive ability

3436
01:03:59,450 --> 01:03:59,460
yeah and our ability cognitive ability
 

3437
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:01,670
yeah and our ability cognitive ability
to filter it all out and not it would

3438
01:04:01,670 --> 01:04:01,680
to filter it all out and not it would
 

3439
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:03,410
to filter it all out and not it would
not really overwhelm us actually if we

3440
01:04:03,410 --> 01:04:03,420
not really overwhelm us actually if we
 

3441
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:04,970
not really overwhelm us actually if we
could see all of it but my main point is

3442
01:04:04,970 --> 01:04:04,980
could see all of it but my main point is
 

3443
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:06,349
could see all of it but my main point is
it goes back to your thing about fire

3444
01:04:06,349 --> 01:04:06,359
it goes back to your thing about fire
 

3445
01:04:06,359 --> 01:04:09,829
it goes back to your thing about fire
and self-protection if if these ionize

3446
01:04:09,829 --> 01:04:09,839
and self-protection if if these ionize
 

3447
01:04:09,839 --> 01:04:11,630
and self-protection if if these ionize
if ionizing radiation was such a

3448
01:04:11,630 --> 01:04:11,640
if ionizing radiation was such a
 

3449
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:13,549
if ionizing radiation was such a
critical aspect of the health of

3450
01:04:13,549 --> 01:04:13,559
critical aspect of the health of
 

3451
01:04:13,559 --> 01:04:15,470
critical aspect of the health of
organisms on Earth we would almost

3452
01:04:15,470 --> 01:04:15,480
organisms on Earth we would almost
 

3453
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:17,510
organisms on Earth we would almost
certainly have evolved methods to detect

3454
01:04:17,510 --> 01:04:17,520
certainly have evolved methods to detect
 

3455
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,690
certainly have evolved methods to detect
it and we have none

3456
01:04:19,690 --> 01:04:19,700
it and we have none
 

3457
01:04:19,700 --> 01:04:22,730
it and we have none
and uh yes the physical world that's all

3458
01:04:22,730 --> 01:04:22,740
and uh yes the physical world that's all
 

3459
01:04:22,740 --> 01:04:25,670
and uh yes the physical world that's all
around us yeah you're blowing my mind uh

3460
01:04:25,670 --> 01:04:25,680
around us yeah you're blowing my mind uh
 

3461
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:28,370
around us yeah you're blowing my mind uh
Dr Dennis white okay let's so you have

3462
01:04:28,370 --> 01:04:28,380
Dr Dennis white okay let's so you have
 

3463
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:30,829
Dr Dennis white okay let's so you have
experience with Magnetic confinement you

3464
01:04:30,829 --> 01:04:30,839
experience with Magnetic confinement you
 

3465
01:04:30,839 --> 01:04:31,730
experience with Magnetic confinement you
have experience with inertial

3466
01:04:31,730 --> 01:04:31,740
have experience with inertial
 

3467
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:33,289
have experience with inertial
confinement most of your work has been a

3468
01:04:33,289 --> 01:04:33,299
confinement most of your work has been a
 

3469
01:04:33,299 --> 01:04:36,890
confinement most of your work has been a
magnetic economy but let's sort of

3470
01:04:36,890 --> 01:04:36,900
magnetic economy but let's sort of
 

3471
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:39,470
magnetic economy but let's sort of
um talk about the the the the sexy

3472
01:04:39,470 --> 01:04:39,480
um talk about the the the the sexy
 

3473
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:41,390
um talk about the the the the sexy
recent thing for for a bit of a time

3474
01:04:41,390 --> 01:04:41,400
recent thing for for a bit of a time
 

3475
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:43,430
recent thing for for a bit of a time
there's been a breakthrough in the news

3476
01:04:43,430 --> 01:04:43,440
there's been a breakthrough in the news
 

3477
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:44,690
there's been a breakthrough in the news
uh

3478
01:04:44,690 --> 01:04:44,700
uh
 

3479
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:47,390
uh
uh that uh laser-based inertial

3480
01:04:47,390 --> 01:04:47,400
uh that uh laser-based inertial
 

3481
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:50,089
uh that uh laser-based inertial
confinement was used by Doe's National

3482
01:04:50,089 --> 01:04:50,099
confinement was used by Doe's National
 

3483
01:04:50,099 --> 01:04:51,950
confinement was used by Doe's National
ignition facility at the Lawrence

3484
01:04:51,950 --> 01:04:51,960
ignition facility at the Lawrence
 

3485
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:54,230
ignition facility at the Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory can you

3486
01:04:54,230 --> 01:04:54,240
Livermore National Laboratory can you
 

3487
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:55,490
Livermore National Laboratory can you
explain this breakthrough that happened

3488
01:04:55,490 --> 01:04:55,500
explain this breakthrough that happened
 

3489
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:56,990
explain this breakthrough that happened
in December yeah

3490
01:04:56,990 --> 01:04:57,000
in December yeah
 

3491
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:00,049
in December yeah
so it goes to the set of criteria that I

3492
01:05:00,049 --> 01:05:00,059
so it goes to the set of criteria that I
 

3493
01:05:00,059 --> 01:05:02,450
so it goes to the set of criteria that I
talked about before about getting

3494
01:05:02,450 --> 01:05:02,460
talked about before about getting
 

3495
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:06,230
talked about before about getting
high energy gain so in the end

3496
01:05:06,230 --> 01:05:06,240
high energy gain so in the end
 

3497
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:08,870
high energy gain so in the end
what what are we after in Fusion is that

3498
01:05:08,870 --> 01:05:08,880
what what are we after in Fusion is that
 

3499
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:11,750
what what are we after in Fusion is that
we we basically assemble this plasma

3500
01:05:11,750 --> 01:05:11,760
we we basically assemble this plasma
 

3501
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:14,690
we we basically assemble this plasma
fuel in some way and we provided a

3502
01:05:14,690 --> 01:05:14,700
fuel in some way and we provided a
 

3503
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:16,789
fuel in some way and we provided a
starting amount of energy think of

3504
01:05:16,789 --> 01:05:16,799
starting amount of energy think of
 

3505
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:19,309
starting amount of energy think of
lighting the fire and what you want to

3506
01:05:19,309 --> 01:05:19,319
lighting the fire and what you want to
 

3507
01:05:19,319 --> 01:05:22,910
lighting the fire and what you want to
do is get back like significant excess

3508
01:05:22,910 --> 01:05:22,920
do is get back like significant excess
 

3509
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:25,549
do is get back like significant excess
gain from the fact that the fusion is is

3510
01:05:25,549 --> 01:05:25,559
gain from the fact that the fusion is is
 

3511
01:05:25,559 --> 01:05:28,549
gain from the fact that the fusion is is
making more is releasing the energy so

3512
01:05:28,549 --> 01:05:28,559
making more is releasing the energy so
 

3513
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:30,530
making more is releasing the energy so
it's it's like the equivalent of like we

3514
01:05:30,530 --> 01:05:30,540
it's it's like the equivalent of like we
 

3515
01:05:30,540 --> 01:05:32,630
it's it's like the equivalent of like we
want to have a match a small match light

3516
01:05:32,630 --> 01:05:32,640
want to have a match a small match light
 

3517
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:34,250
want to have a match a small match light
a fire and then the fire Keeps Us hot

3518
01:05:34,250 --> 01:05:34,260
a fire and then the fire Keeps Us hot
 

3519
01:05:34,260 --> 01:05:37,250
a fire and then the fire Keeps Us hot
it's like this is very much like that

3520
01:05:37,250 --> 01:05:37,260
it's like this is very much like that
 

3521
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:39,770
it's like this is very much like that
so as I said we've we've made many of

3522
01:05:39,770 --> 01:05:39,780
so as I said we've we've made many of
 

3523
01:05:39,780 --> 01:05:41,210
so as I said we've we've made many of
the and what I mean by we it's like the

3524
01:05:41,210 --> 01:05:41,220
the and what I mean by we it's like the
 

3525
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:43,789
the and what I mean by we it's like the
fusion Community has pursued aspects of

3526
01:05:43,789 --> 01:05:43,799
fusion Community has pursued aspects of
 

3527
01:05:43,799 --> 01:05:44,870
fusion Community has pursued aspects of
this through a variety of different

3528
01:05:44,870 --> 01:05:44,880
this through a variety of different
 

3529
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:47,809
this through a variety of different
confinement uh methodologies

3530
01:05:47,809 --> 01:05:47,819
confinement uh methodologies
 

3531
01:05:47,819 --> 01:05:49,670
confinement uh methodologies
um is that the

3532
01:05:49,670 --> 01:05:49,680
um is that the
 

3533
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:52,789
um is that the
um the key part about what happens

3534
01:05:52,789 --> 01:05:52,799
um the key part about what happens
 

3535
01:05:52,799 --> 01:05:54,829
um the key part about what happens
what was the threshold we had never

3536
01:05:54,829 --> 01:05:54,839
what was the threshold we had never
 

3537
01:05:54,839 --> 01:05:57,230
what was the threshold we had never
gotten over before was that if you only

3538
01:05:57,230 --> 01:05:57,240
gotten over before was that if you only
 

3539
01:05:57,240 --> 01:05:59,690
gotten over before was that if you only
consider the plasma fuel not the not the

3540
01:05:59,690 --> 01:05:59,700
consider the plasma fuel not the not the
 

3541
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:01,190
consider the plasma fuel not the not the
total engineering system but just the

3542
01:06:01,190 --> 01:06:01,200
total engineering system but just the
 

3543
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,829
total engineering system but just the
plasma fuel itself we had not gotten to

3544
01:06:03,829 --> 01:06:03,839
plasma fuel itself we had not gotten to
 

3545
01:06:03,839 --> 01:06:06,410
plasma fuel itself we had not gotten to
the point yet where basically the size

3546
01:06:06,410 --> 01:06:06,420
the point yet where basically the size
 

3547
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:09,890
the point yet where basically the size
of the match was was smaller than the

3548
01:06:09,890 --> 01:06:09,900
of the match was was smaller than the
 

3549
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:11,690
of the match was was smaller than the
amount of energy that we got from the

3550
01:06:11,690 --> 01:06:11,700
amount of energy that we got from the
 

3551
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:14,750
amount of energy that we got from the
fusion is there a good term for when the

3552
01:06:14,750 --> 01:06:14,760
fusion is there a good term for when the
 

3553
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:17,870
fusion is there a good term for when the
output is greater than the input yes yes

3554
01:06:17,870 --> 01:06:17,880
output is greater than the input yes yes
 

3555
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:20,569
output is greater than the input yes yes
it there is well there's several special

3556
01:06:20,569 --> 01:06:20,579
it there is well there's several special
 

3557
01:06:20,579 --> 01:06:22,670
it there is well there's several special
definitions of this so one of them is

3558
01:06:22,670 --> 01:06:22,680
definitions of this so one of them is
 

3559
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:25,670
definitions of this so one of them is
that if you if you like in a fire if you

3560
01:06:25,670 --> 01:06:25,680
that if you if you like in a fire if you
 

3561
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:27,829
that if you if you like in a fire if you
light a match and you have it there and

3562
01:06:27,829 --> 01:06:27,839
light a match and you have it there and
 

3563
01:06:27,839 --> 01:06:29,809
light a match and you have it there and
it's an infinitesimal amount of energy

3564
01:06:29,809 --> 01:06:29,819
it's an infinitesimal amount of energy
 

3565
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:31,370
it's an infinitesimal amount of energy
compared to what you're getting out of

3566
01:06:31,370 --> 01:06:31,380
compared to what you're getting out of
 

3567
01:06:31,380 --> 01:06:33,589
compared to what you're getting out of
the fire we call this ignition which

3568
01:06:33,589 --> 01:06:33,599
the fire we call this ignition which
 

3569
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:35,270
the fire we call this ignition which
makes sense right this is like what the

3570
01:06:35,270 --> 01:06:35,280
makes sense right this is like what the
 

3571
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:37,849
makes sense right this is like what the
what our own sign is as well too so that

3572
01:06:37,849 --> 01:06:37,859
what our own sign is as well too so that
 

3573
01:06:37,859 --> 01:06:40,309
what our own sign is as well too so that
that was not ignition in that sense as

3574
01:06:40,309 --> 01:06:40,319
that was not ignition in that sense as
 

3575
01:06:40,319 --> 01:06:42,410
that was not ignition in that sense as
well too so what we call this the

3576
01:06:42,410 --> 01:06:42,420
well too so what we call this the
 

3577
01:06:42,420 --> 01:06:44,329
well too so what we call this the
scientific what the one that we I just

3578
01:06:44,329 --> 01:06:44,339
scientific what the one that we I just
 

3579
01:06:44,339 --> 01:06:46,069
scientific what the one that we I just
talked about which is for for some

3580
01:06:46,069 --> 01:06:46,079
talked about which is for for some
 

3581
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:48,770
talked about which is for for some
instance when I get enough Fusion energy

3582
01:06:48,770 --> 01:06:48,780
instance when I get enough Fusion energy
 

3583
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:51,049
instance when I get enough Fusion energy
released compared to the size of the

3584
01:06:51,049 --> 01:06:51,059
released compared to the size of the
 

3585
01:06:51,059 --> 01:06:53,510
released compared to the size of the
match we call this sign to Civic break

3586
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:53,520
match we call this sign to Civic break
 

3587
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:56,210
match we call this sign to Civic break
even break even break even and it's

3588
01:06:56,210 --> 01:06:56,220
even break even break even and it's
 

3589
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:57,890
even break even break even and it's
because you've gotten past the fact that

3590
01:06:57,890 --> 01:06:57,900
because you've gotten past the fact that
 

3591
01:06:57,900 --> 01:07:00,650
because you've gotten past the fact that
this is Unity now at this point what is

01:07:00,650 --> 01:07:00,660
this is Unity now at this point what is
 

3593
01:07:00,660 --> 01:07:04,190
this is Unity now at this point what is
a fusion gain or as using the notation Q

Tacoma before talk using just the same
 

3599
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:10,309
Tacoma before talk using just the same
kind of terms yeah actually so the

01:07:10,319 --> 01:07:13,750
kind of terms yeah actually so the
technical term is Q capital Q

01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:16,130
technical term is Q capital Q
people actually use Cube we actually use

3604
01:07:16,130 --> 01:07:16,140
people actually use Cube we actually use
 

3605
01:07:16,140 --> 01:07:18,289
people actually use Cube we actually use
capital Q or sometimes it's called Q is

3606
01:07:18,289 --> 01:07:18,299
capital Q or sometimes it's called Q is
 

3607
01:07:18,299 --> 01:07:20,510
capital Q or sometimes it's called Q is
taken Q sub P or something like this

3608
01:07:20,510 --> 01:07:20,520
taken Q sub P or something like this
 

3609
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:22,970
taken Q sub P or something like this
okay okay so this is which which means

3610
01:07:22,970 --> 01:07:22,980
okay okay so this is which which means
 

3611
01:07:22,980 --> 01:07:24,770
okay okay so this is which which means
what what it means is that it's in the

3612
01:07:24,770 --> 01:07:24,780
what what it means is that it's in the
 

3613
01:07:24,780 --> 01:07:26,990
what what it means is that it's in the
plasma so all we're considering is is

3614
01:07:26,990 --> 01:07:27,000
plasma so all we're considering is is
 

3615
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,089
plasma so all we're considering is is
the energy balance or a gain that comes

3616
01:07:29,089 --> 01:07:29,099
the energy balance or a gain that comes
 

3617
01:07:29,099 --> 01:07:30,890
the energy balance or a gain that comes
from the plasma itself we're not

3618
01:07:30,890 --> 01:07:30,900
from the plasma itself we're not
 

3619
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:33,410
from the plasma itself we're not
considering the Technologies which are

3620
01:07:33,410 --> 01:07:33,420
considering the Technologies which are
 

3621
01:07:33,420 --> 01:07:34,849
considering the Technologies which are
around it which are providing the

3622
01:07:34,849 --> 01:07:34,859
around it which are providing the
 

3623
01:07:34,859 --> 01:07:37,970
around it which are providing the
containment and so forth so why why the

3624
01:07:37,970 --> 01:07:37,980
containment and so forth so why why the
 

3625
01:07:37,980 --> 01:07:40,190
containment and so forth so why why the
excitement and so well because for one

3626
01:07:40,190 --> 01:07:40,200
excitement and so well because for one
 

3627
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:42,109
excitement and so well because for one
reason it's a rather Sim it's a rather

3628
01:07:42,109 --> 01:07:42,119
reason it's a rather Sim it's a rather
 

3629
01:07:42,119 --> 01:07:44,329
reason it's a rather Sim it's a rather

01:07:44,329 --> 01:07:44,339
simple threshold to get over to
 

3631
01:07:44,339 --> 01:07:45,770

01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:45,780
understand that you're getting more
 

3633
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:48,470
understand that you're getting more
energy out from the fusion even the

01:07:48,470 --> 01:07:48,480
energy out from the fusion even the
 

3635
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:50,450

mean consent actually simple it's

3640
01:07:53,750 --> 01:07:53,760
mean consent actually simple it's
 

3641
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:55,130
mean consent actually simple it's
conceptually simple that you get past

01:07:55,130 --> 01:07:55,140
conceptually simple that you get past
 

3643
01:07:55,140 --> 01:07:57,410
conceptually simple that you get past
one that everyone under like when you're

3644
01:07:57,410 --> 01:07:57,420
one that everyone under like when you're
 

3645
01:07:57,420 --> 01:07:59,210
one that everyone under like when you're
less than one that's much less

3646
01:07:59,210 --> 01:07:59,220
less than one that's much less
 

3647
01:07:59,220 --> 01:08:00,589
less than one that's much less
interesting than getting past one

3648
01:08:00,589 --> 01:08:00,599
interesting than getting past one
 

3649
01:08:00,599 --> 01:08:02,410
interesting than getting past one
because that's a really big you started

3650
01:08:02,410 --> 01:08:02,420
because that's a really big you started
 

3651
01:08:02,420 --> 01:08:05,089
because that's a really big you started
to get fast but it's it's really it

01:08:05,089 --> 01:08:05,099
to get fast but it's it's really it
 

3653
01:08:05,099 --> 01:08:06,770
to get fast but it's it's really it
really is a scientific threshold because

3654
01:08:06,770 --> 01:08:06,780
really is a scientific threshold because

01:08:06,780 --> 01:08:09,770
really is a scientific threshold because
what QP actually

um denotes is the relative amount of

3658
01:08:13,430 --> 01:08:13,440
um denotes is the relative amount of
 

3659
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:16,249
um denotes is the relative amount of
self-heating that's happening in the in

01:08:16,249 --> 01:08:16,259
self-heating that's happening in the in
 

3661
01:08:16,259 --> 01:08:18,950
self-heating that's happening in the in
the plasma so what I mean by this is

3662
01:08:18,950 --> 01:08:18,960
the plasma so what I mean by this is
 

3663
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:22,010
the plasma so what I mean by this is
that in the end in these systems for and

3664
01:08:22,010 --> 01:08:22,020
that in the end in these systems for and
 

3665
01:08:22,020 --> 01:08:25,130
that in the end in these systems for and
what what you want is something that

3666
01:08:25,130 --> 01:08:25,140
what what you want is something that
 

3667
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:28,010
what what you want is something that
where the the relative amount of of

3668
01:08:28,010 --> 01:08:28,020
where the the relative amount of of
 

3669
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:30,890
where the the relative amount of of
heating which is keeping the fuel hot is

3670
01:08:30,890 --> 01:08:30,900
heating which is keeping the fuel hot is
 

3671
01:08:30,900 --> 01:08:33,590
heating which is keeping the fuel hot is
dominated by from the fusion reactions

3672
01:08:33,590 --> 01:08:33,600
dominated by from the fusion reactions
 

3673
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:36,829
dominated by from the fusion reactions
themselves and and so it becomes it's

3674
01:08:36,829 --> 01:08:36,839
themselves and and so it becomes it's
 

3675
01:08:36,839 --> 01:08:38,450
themselves and and so it becomes it's
it's sort of like thinking like a

3676
01:08:38,450 --> 01:08:38,460
it's sort of like thinking like a
 

3677
01:08:38,460 --> 01:08:40,189
it's sort of like thinking like a
bonfire is a lot more interesting

3678
01:08:40,189 --> 01:08:40,199
bonfire is a lot more interesting
 

3679
01:08:40,199 --> 01:08:42,289
bonfire is a lot more interesting
physically than just holding a blow

3680
01:08:42,289 --> 01:08:42,299
physically than just holding a blow
 

3681
01:08:42,299 --> 01:08:44,870

torch to a wet log right there's a lot

3682
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:44,880
torch to a wet log right there's a lot
 

3683
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:46,249
torch to a wet log right there's a lot
more Dynamics it's a lot more

3684
01:08:46,249 --> 01:08:46,259
more Dynamics it's a lot more
 

3685
01:08:46,259 --> 01:08:49,130
more Dynamics it's a lot more
self-evolved and so forth and what we're

3686
01:08:49,130 --> 01:08:49,140
self-evolved and so forth and what we're
 

3687
01:08:49,140 --> 01:08:51,890
self-evolved and so forth and what we're
excited as a scientists is that it's

3688
01:08:51,890 --> 01:08:51,900
excited as a scientists is that it's
 

3689
01:08:51,900 --> 01:08:54,169
excited as a scientists is that it's
clear that the the in that experiment

3690
01:08:54,169 --> 01:08:54,179
clear that the the in that experiment
 

3691
01:08:54,179 --> 01:08:56,450
clear that the the in that experiment
that they actually got to a point where

3692
01:08:56,450 --> 01:08:56,460
that they actually got to a point where
 

3693
01:08:56,460 --> 01:08:59,329
that they actually got to a point where
the fusion reactions themselves were

3694
01:08:59,329 --> 01:08:59,339
the fusion reactions themselves were
 

3695
01:08:59,339 --> 01:09:01,130
the fusion reactions themselves were
actually altering the state of the

3696
01:09:01,130 --> 01:09:01,140
actually altering the state of the
 

3697
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:02,990
actually altering the state of the
plasma

3698
01:09:02,990 --> 01:09:03,000
plasma
 

3699
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,090
plasma
I was like wow I mean we'd seen it in

3700
01:09:05,090 --> 01:09:05,100
I was like wow I mean we'd seen it in
 

3701
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:06,890
I was like wow I mean we'd seen it in
glimpses before in magnetic confinement

3702
01:09:06,890 --> 01:09:06,900
glimpses before in magnetic confinement
 

3703
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:08,749
glimpses before in magnetic confinement
at relatively small levels but

3704
01:09:08,749 --> 01:09:08,759
at relatively small levels but
 

3705
01:09:08,759 --> 01:09:10,370
at relatively small levels but
apparently it seems like in this

3706
01:09:10,370 --> 01:09:10,380
apparently it seems like in this
 

3707
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:12,789
apparently it seems like in this
experiment it's likely to be a dominant

3708
01:09:12,789 --> 01:09:12,799
experiment it's likely to be a dominant
 

3709
01:09:12,799 --> 01:09:15,410
experiment it's likely to be a dominant
dominated by self-heating that's a very

3710
01:09:15,410 --> 01:09:15,420
dominated by self-heating that's a very
 

3711
01:09:15,420 --> 01:09:16,789
dominated by self-heating that's a very
important that's a very interesting that

3712
01:09:16,789 --> 01:09:16,799
important that's a very interesting that
 

3713
01:09:16,799 --> 01:09:18,890
important that's a very interesting that
makes it a self-sustaining type of it's

3714
01:09:18,890 --> 01:09:18,900
makes it a self-sustaining type of it's
 

3715
01:09:18,900 --> 01:09:20,269
makes it a self-sustaining type of it's
more self-sustaining it's more

3716
01:09:20,269 --> 01:09:20,279
more self-sustaining it's more
 

3717
01:09:20,279 --> 01:09:23,090
more self-sustaining it's more
self-referential system uh in in a sense

3718
01:09:23,090 --> 01:09:23,100
self-referential system uh in in a sense
 

3719
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:25,430
self-referential system uh in in a sense
and it sort of self-evolves in a way

3720
01:09:25,430 --> 01:09:25,440
and it sort of self-evolves in a way
 

3721
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:26,749
and it sort of self-evolves in a way
again it's not that it's going to evolve

3722
01:09:26,749 --> 01:09:26,759
again it's not that it's going to evolve
 

3723
01:09:26,759 --> 01:09:28,849
again it's not that it's going to evolve
to a dangerous State it's just that we

3724
01:09:28,849 --> 01:09:28,859
to a dangerous State it's just that we
 

3725
01:09:28,859 --> 01:09:30,709
to a dangerous State it's just that we
want to see what happens when when the

3726
01:09:30,709 --> 01:09:30,719
want to see what happens when when the
 

3727
01:09:30,719 --> 01:09:32,329
want to see what happens when when the
fusion is the dominant heating source

3728
01:09:32,329 --> 01:09:32,339
fusion is the dominant heating source
 

3729
01:09:32,339 --> 01:09:34,550
fusion is the dominant heating source
and we'll talk about that but so there's

3730
01:09:34,550 --> 01:09:34,560
and we'll talk about that but so there's
 

3731
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:36,050
and we'll talk about that but so there's
also another element which is the

3732
01:09:36,050 --> 01:09:36,060
also another element which is the
 

3733
01:09:36,060 --> 01:09:38,030
also another element which is the
inertial confinement

3734
01:09:38,030 --> 01:09:38,040
inertial confinement
 

3735
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:40,370
inertial confinement
uh laser-based initial confinement is

3736
01:09:40,370 --> 01:09:40,380
uh laser-based initial confinement is
 

3737
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:42,769
uh laser-based initial confinement is
kind of a little bit of another dog okay

3738
01:09:42,769 --> 01:09:42,779
kind of a little bit of another dog okay
 

3739
01:09:42,779 --> 01:09:45,470
kind of a little bit of another dog okay
so a lot of the broad nuclear fusion

3740
01:09:45,470 --> 01:09:45,480
so a lot of the broad nuclear fusion
 

3741
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:46,849
so a lot of the broad nuclear fusion
Community has been focused on magnetic

01:09:46,849 --> 01:09:46,859
Community has been focused on magnetic
 

3743
01:09:46,859 --> 01:09:49,910
Community has been focused on magnetic
confinement can you explain just how

3744
01:09:49,910 --> 01:09:49,920
confinement can you explain just how
 

3745
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:52,309
confinement can you explain just how
laser-based inertial confinement works

3746
01:09:52,309 --> 01:09:52,319
laser-based inertial confinement works
 

3747
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:56,510
laser-based inertial confinement works
so it says uh 192 laser beams were

3748
01:09:56,510 --> 01:09:56,520
so it says uh 192 laser beams were
 

3749
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:59,689
so it says uh 192 laser beams were
aligned on a deuterium tritium DT Target

3750
01:09:59,689 --> 01:09:59,699
aligned on a deuterium tritium DT Target
 

3751
01:09:59,699 --> 01:10:03,350
aligned on a deuterium tritium DT Target
smaller than a p yes uh this is like

3752
01:10:03,350 --> 01:10:03,360
smaller than a p yes uh this is like
 

3753
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:05,990
smaller than a p yes uh this is like
actually yeah okay well you know it

3754
01:10:05,990 --> 01:10:06,000
actually yeah okay well you know it
 

3755
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,910
actually yeah okay well you know it
depends not all P's are made the same

3756
01:10:07,910 --> 01:10:07,920
depends not all P's are made the same
 

3757
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:10,250
depends not all P's are made the same
but uh this is like throwing a perfect

3758
01:10:10,250 --> 01:10:10,260
but uh this is like throwing a perfect
 

3759
01:10:10,260 --> 01:10:13,010
but uh this is like throwing a perfect
strike in baseball from a pitch this is

3760
01:10:13,010 --> 01:10:13,020
strike in baseball from a pitch this is
 

3761
01:10:13,020 --> 01:10:14,209
strike in baseball from a pitch this is
like a journalist wrote this I think

3762
01:10:14,209 --> 01:10:14,219
like a journalist wrote this I think
 

3763
01:10:14,219 --> 01:10:16,130
like a journalist wrote this I think
this is like oh no it's not a journalist

3764
01:10:16,130 --> 01:10:16,140
this is like oh no it's not a journalist
 

3765
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:19,310
this is like oh no it's not a journalist
it's do yeah yeah we try to use all

3766
01:10:19,310 --> 01:10:19,320
it's do yeah yeah we try to use all
 

3767
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:21,649
it's do yeah yeah we try to use all
these analogies this is like throwing a

3768
01:10:21,649 --> 01:10:21,659
these analogies this is like throwing a
 

3769
01:10:21,659 --> 01:10:24,050
these analogies this is like throwing a
perfect strike in baseball from a

3770
01:10:24,050 --> 01:10:24,060
perfect strike in baseball from a
 

3771
01:10:24,060 --> 01:10:26,750
perfect strike in baseball from a
pitcher's Mount 350 miles away from the

01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:37,010
okay so can you explain interesting what
the what the lasers what what actually

3782
01:10:37,010 --> 01:10:37,020
the what the lasers what what actually
 

3783
01:10:37,020 --> 01:10:38,570
the what the lasers what what actually
happens yeah actually there's usually

3784
01:10:38,570 --> 01:10:38,580
happens yeah actually there's usually
 

3785
01:10:38,580 --> 01:10:41,030

Mass confusion about this so

3786
01:10:41,030 --> 01:10:41,040
Mass confusion about this so
 

3787
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:43,010
Mass confusion about this so
um so what's going on in this form over

3788
01:10:43,010 --> 01:10:43,020
um so what's going on in this form over
 

3789
01:10:43,020 --> 01:10:44,990
um so what's going on in this form over
so the fuel

3790
01:10:44,990 --> 01:10:45,000
so the fuel
 

3791
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:48,110
so the fuel
is is is delivered in a discrete the

3792
01:10:48,110 --> 01:10:48,120
is is is delivered in a discrete the
 

3793
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:50,330
is is is delivered in a discrete the
Fusion fuel the deuterium and tritium is

3794
01:10:50,330 --> 01:10:50,340
Fusion fuel the deuterium and tritium is
 

3795
01:10:50,340 --> 01:10:52,310
Fusion fuel the deuterium and tritium is
in a discrete spherical it's more like a

3796
01:10:52,310 --> 01:10:52,320
in a discrete spherical it's more like a
 

3797
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:54,530
in a discrete spherical it's more like a
BB let's call it a BB so it's a small

3798
01:10:54,530 --> 01:10:54,540
BB let's call it a BB so it's a small
 

3799
01:10:54,540 --> 01:10:56,149
BB let's call it a BB so it's a small
one and all the fuel that you're going

3800
01:10:56,149 --> 01:10:56,159
one and all the fuel that you're going
 

3801
01:10:56,159 --> 01:10:58,189
one and all the fuel that you're going
to try to to burn is basically there

3802
01:10:58,189 --> 01:10:58,199
to try to to burn is basically there
 

3803
01:10:58,199 --> 01:11:01,430
to try to to burn is basically there
okay and it's about that size so what's

3804
01:11:01,430 --> 01:11:01,440
okay and it's about that size so what's
 

3805
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:03,350
okay and it's about that size so what's
hap so how are you going to get and it's

3806
01:11:03,350 --> 01:11:03,360
hap so how are you going to get and it's
 

3807
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:05,750
hap so how are you going to get and it's
that literally it's like at 20 degrees

3808
01:11:05,750 --> 01:11:05,760
that literally it's like at 20 degrees
 

3809
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:07,610
that literally it's like at 20 degrees
above absolute zero because the

3810
01:11:07,610 --> 01:11:07,620
above absolute zero because the
 

3811
01:11:07,620 --> 01:11:10,130
above absolute zero because the
deuterium and tritium are kept in in a

3812
01:11:10,130 --> 01:11:10,140
deuterium and tritium are kept in in a
 

3813
01:11:10,140 --> 01:11:13,130
deuterium and tritium are kept in in a
liquid in a solid state so the fuel is

3814
01:11:13,130 --> 01:11:13,140
liquid in a solid state so the fuel is
 

3815
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:15,649
liquid in a solid state so the fuel is
injected not as a gas as a solid it's

3816
01:11:15,649 --> 01:11:15,659
injected not as a gas as a solid it's
 

3817
01:11:15,659 --> 01:11:17,630
injected not as a gas as a solid it's
actually and it's very and these are

3818
01:11:17,630 --> 01:11:17,640
actually and it's very and these are
 

3819
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:18,770
actually and it's very and these are
particular experiments they can

3820
01:11:18,770 --> 01:11:18,780
particular experiments they can
 

3821
01:11:18,780 --> 01:11:21,169
particular experiments they can
introduce one of these you know these

3822
01:11:21,169 --> 01:11:21,179
introduce one of these you know these
 

3823
01:11:21,179 --> 01:11:22,910
introduce one of these you know these
targets once per day approximately

3824
01:11:22,910 --> 01:11:22,920
targets once per day approximately
 

3825
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:24,649
targets once per day approximately
something like that because it's very

3826
01:11:24,649 --> 01:11:24,659
something like that because it's very
 

3827
01:11:24,659 --> 01:11:27,050
something like that because it's very
it's very it's kind of amazing

3828
01:11:27,050 --> 01:11:27,060
it's very it's kind of amazing
 

3829
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:29,149
it's very it's kind of amazing
technology actually that I know some of

3830
01:11:29,149 --> 01:11:29,159
technology actually that I know some of
 

3831
01:11:29,159 --> 01:11:30,830
technology actually that I know some of
the people that worked on this uh back

3832
01:11:30,830 --> 01:11:30,840
the people that worked on this uh back
 

3833
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:32,209
the people that worked on this uh back
in the is

3834
01:11:32,209 --> 01:11:32,219
in the is
 

3835
01:11:32,219 --> 01:11:34,310
in the is
um they actually make these things out

3836
01:11:34,310 --> 01:11:34,320
um they actually make these things out
 

3837
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:36,890
um they actually make these things out
of BB size of this frozen fuel it's

3838
01:11:36,890 --> 01:11:36,900
of BB size of this frozen fuel it's
 

3839
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:39,110
of BB size of this frozen fuel it's
actually a cryogenic temperatures and

3840
01:11:39,110 --> 01:11:39,120
actually a cryogenic temperatures and
 

3841
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:41,570
actually a cryogenic temperatures and
they're almost like Smooth to the atom

3842
01:11:41,570 --> 01:11:41,580
they're almost like Smooth to the atom
 

3843
01:11:41,580 --> 01:11:44,149
they're almost like Smooth to the atom
level I mean they're amazing pieces of

3844
01:11:44,149 --> 01:11:44,159
level I mean they're amazing pieces of
 

3845
01:11:44,159 --> 01:11:45,110
level I mean they're amazing pieces of
Technology

3846
01:11:45,110 --> 01:11:45,120
Technology
 

3847
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:48,350
Technology
so what you do in the end is think what

3848
01:11:48,350 --> 01:11:48,360
so what you do in the end is think what
 

3849
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:50,330
so what you do in the end is think what
you have is a spherical

3850
01:11:50,330 --> 01:11:50,340
you have is a spherical
 

3851
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:53,570
you have is a spherical
assembly of this fuel like a ball and

3852
01:11:53,570 --> 01:11:53,580
assembly of this fuel like a ball and
 

3853
01:11:53,580 --> 01:11:55,250
assembly of this fuel like a ball and
what what is the purpose of the lasers

3854
01:11:55,250 --> 01:11:55,260
what what is the purpose of the lasers
 

3855
01:11:55,260 --> 01:11:57,410
what what is the purpose of the lasers
the purpose of the lasers is to provide

3856
01:11:57,410 --> 01:11:57,420
the purpose of the lasers is to provide
 

3857
01:11:57,420 --> 01:12:01,070
the purpose of the lasers is to provide
Optical energy to the very outside of

3858
01:12:01,070 --> 01:12:01,080
Optical energy to the very outside of
 

3859
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:05,030
Optical energy to the very outside of
this and what happens is the that energy

3860
01:12:05,030 --> 01:12:05,040
this and what happens is the that energy
 

3861
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:07,850
this and what happens is the that energy
is absorbed because it's it's in the

3862
01:12:07,850 --> 01:12:07,860
is absorbed because it's it's in the
 

3863
01:12:07,860 --> 01:12:09,470
is absorbed because it's it's in the
solid phase of matter so it's absorbed

3864
01:12:09,470 --> 01:12:09,480
solid phase of matter so it's absorbed
 

3865
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:11,450
solid phase of matter so it's absorbed
really in the surface and then what

3866
01:12:11,450 --> 01:12:11,460
really in the surface and then what
 

3867
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:13,550
really in the surface and then what
happens is that when it's absorbed in

3868
01:12:13,550 --> 01:12:13,560
happens is that when it's absorbed in
 

3869
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:15,530
happens is that when it's absorbed in
something called the ablator what does

3870
01:12:15,530 --> 01:12:15,540
something called the ablator what does
 

3871
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:17,390
something called the ablator what does
that mean it means it goes instantly

3872
01:12:17,390 --> 01:12:17,400
that mean it means it goes instantly
 

3873
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:20,930
that mean it means it goes instantly
from the solid phase to the gas phase so

3874
01:12:20,930 --> 01:12:20,940
from the solid phase to the gas phase so
 

3875
01:12:20,940 --> 01:12:23,330
from the solid phase to the gas phase so
it becomes like a rocket engine and but

3876
01:12:23,330 --> 01:12:23,340
it becomes like a rocket engine and but
 

3877
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:26,450
it becomes like a rocket engine and but
you hit it like very uniformly so all

3878
01:12:26,450 --> 01:12:26,460
you hit it like very uniformly so all
 

3879
01:12:26,460 --> 01:12:28,850
you hit it like very uniformly so all
there's like rocket engines coming off

3880
01:12:28,850 --> 01:12:28,860
there's like rocket engines coming off
 

3881
01:12:28,860 --> 01:12:30,890
there's like rocket engines coming off
this surface think of like an asteroid

3882
01:12:30,890 --> 01:12:30,900
this surface think of like an asteroid
 

3883
01:12:30,900 --> 01:12:32,570
this surface think of like an asteroid
almost where there's like rockets coming

3884
01:12:32,570 --> 01:12:32,580
almost where there's like rockets coming
 

3885
01:12:32,580 --> 01:12:34,430
almost where there's like rockets coming
off and all this thing so what does that

3886
01:12:34,430 --> 01:12:34,440
off and all this thing so what does that
 

3887
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:36,110
off and all this thing so what does that
do what does a rocket do it actually

3888
01:12:36,110 --> 01:12:36,120
do what does a rocket do it actually
 

3889
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:39,470
do what does a rocket do it actually
pushes by Newton's Laws right it pushes

3890
01:12:39,470 --> 01:12:39,480
pushes by Newton's Laws right it pushes
 

3891
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:41,149
pushes by Newton's Laws right it pushes
the other thing on the other side of it

3892
01:12:41,149 --> 01:12:41,159
the other thing on the other side of it
 

3893
01:12:41,159 --> 01:12:43,370
the other thing on the other side of it
equal and opposite reaction it pushes it

3894
01:12:43,370 --> 01:12:43,380
equal and opposite reaction it pushes it
 

3895
01:12:43,380 --> 01:12:46,550
equal and opposite reaction it pushes it
in so what it does is it that the lasers

3896
01:12:46,550 --> 01:12:46,560
in so what it does is it that the lasers
 

3897
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:48,890
in so what it does is it that the lasers
actually don't Heat this is what was

3898
01:12:48,890 --> 01:12:48,900
actually don't Heat this is what was
 

3899
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:50,870
actually don't Heat this is what was
confusing people think the laser oh

3900
01:12:50,870 --> 01:12:50,880
confusing people think the laser oh
 

3901
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:52,070
confusing people think the laser oh
we're gonna get it to 100 million

3902
01:12:52,070 --> 01:12:52,080
we're gonna get it to 100 million
 

3903
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:53,750
we're gonna get it to 100 million
degrees in fact you want the exact

3904
01:12:53,750 --> 01:12:53,760
degrees in fact you want the exact
 

3905
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:55,910
degrees in fact you want the exact
opposite of this what you want to do is

3906
01:12:55,910 --> 01:12:55,920
opposite of this what you want to do is
 

3907
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:58,189
opposite of this what you want to do is
get essentially a rocket going out like

3908
01:12:58,189 --> 01:12:58,199
get essentially a rocket going out like
 

3909
01:12:58,199 --> 01:13:00,649
get essentially a rocket going out like
this and then what happens is that the

3910
01:13:00,649 --> 01:13:00,659
this and then what happens is that the
 

3911
01:13:00,659 --> 01:13:02,510
this and then what happens is that the
sphere like and this is happening in a

3912
01:13:02,510 --> 01:13:02,520
sphere like and this is happening in a
 

3913
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:04,310
sphere like and this is happening in a
billionth of a second or less actually

3914
01:13:04,310 --> 01:13:04,320
billionth of a second or less actually
 

3915
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:07,669
billionth of a second or less actually
this rapidly that that Force like so

3916
01:13:07,669 --> 01:13:07,679
this rapidly that that Force like so
 

3917
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:10,910
this rapidly that that Force like so
rapidly compresses the fuel that what

3918
01:13:10,910 --> 01:13:10,920
rapidly compresses the fuel that what
 

3919
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:12,709
rapidly compresses the fuel that what
happens is that you're squeezing down on

3920
01:13:12,709 --> 01:13:12,719
happens is that you're squeezing down on
 

3921
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:15,410
happens is that you're squeezing down on
it and and and you know it's like what

3922
01:13:15,410 --> 01:13:15,420
it and and and you know it's like what
 

3923
01:13:15,420 --> 01:13:18,229
it and and and you know it's like what
was the CBB that's bad actually B I

3924
01:13:18,229 --> 01:13:18,239
was the CBB that's bad actually B I
 

3925
01:13:18,239 --> 01:13:19,130
was the CBB that's bad actually B I
should have started with a basketball

3926
01:13:19,130 --> 01:13:19,140
should have started with a basketball
 

3927
01:13:19,140 --> 01:13:21,830
should have started with a basketball
basket goes from like a basketball down

3928
01:13:21,830 --> 01:13:21,840
basket goes from like a basketball down
 

3929
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:24,470
basket goes from like a basketball down
to something like like this and then

3930
01:13:24,470 --> 01:13:24,480
to something like like this and then
 

3931
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:25,970
to something like like this and then
billionth of a second

3932
01:13:25,970 --> 01:13:25,980
billionth of a second
 

3933
01:13:25,980 --> 01:13:28,610
billionth of a second
and when that when that happens I mean

3934
01:13:28,610 --> 01:13:28,620
and when that when that happens I mean
 

3935
01:13:28,620 --> 01:13:30,830
and when that when that happens I mean
you scale that in your mind so when that

3936
01:13:30,830 --> 01:13:30,840
you scale that in your mind so when that
 

3937
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:33,050
you scale that in your mind so when that
happens and in this this comes from

3938
01:13:33,050 --> 01:13:33,060
happens and in this this comes from
 

3939
01:13:33,060 --> 01:13:35,450
happens and in this this comes from
almost from classical physics so there's

3940
01:13:35,450 --> 01:13:35,460
almost from classical physics so there's
 

3941
01:13:35,460 --> 01:13:37,250
almost from classical physics so there's
some Quantum in it as well too but

3942
01:13:37,250 --> 01:13:37,260
some Quantum in it as well too but
 

3943
01:13:37,260 --> 01:13:39,530
some Quantum in it as well too but
basically if you can do this

3944
01:13:39,530 --> 01:13:39,540
basically if you can do this
 

3945
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:41,810
basically if you can do this
um like very uniformly and so-called

3946
01:13:41,810 --> 01:13:41,820
um like very uniformly and so-called
 

3947
01:13:41,820 --> 01:13:43,250
um like very uniformly and so-called
adiabatically like you're not actually

3948
01:13:43,250 --> 01:13:43,260
adiabatically like you're not actually
 

3949
01:13:43,260 --> 01:13:45,709
adiabatically like you're not actually
heating the fuel what happens is you get

3950
01:13:45,709 --> 01:13:45,719
heating the fuel what happens is you get
 

3951
01:13:45,719 --> 01:13:48,410
heating the fuel what happens is you get
adiabatic compression such that the very

3952
01:13:48,410 --> 01:13:48,420
adiabatic compression such that the very
 

3953
01:13:48,420 --> 01:13:49,970
adiabatic compression such that the very
center of this thing all of a sudden

3954
01:13:49,970 --> 01:13:49,980
center of this thing all of a sudden
 

3955
01:13:49,980 --> 01:13:52,250
center of this thing all of a sudden
just spikes up in temperature because

3956
01:13:52,250 --> 01:13:52,260
just spikes up in temperature because
 

3957
01:13:52,260 --> 01:13:55,729
just spikes up in temperature because
it's it's it's actually done so fast so

3958
01:13:55,729 --> 01:13:55,739
it's it's it's actually done so fast so
 

3959
01:13:55,739 --> 01:13:57,770
it's it's it's actually done so fast so
why is it called inertial Fusion it's

3960
01:13:57,770 --> 01:13:57,780
why is it called inertial Fusion it's
 

3961
01:13:57,780 --> 01:14:00,110
why is it called inertial Fusion it's
because you're doing this on such fast

3962
01:14:00,110 --> 01:14:00,120
because you're doing this on such fast
 

3963
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:02,090
because you're doing this on such fast
time scales that the inertia of the hot

3964
01:14:02,090 --> 01:14:02,100
time scales that the inertia of the hot
 

3965
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:04,910
time scales that the inertia of the hot
fuel basically is still finite so it

3966
01:14:04,910 --> 01:14:04,920
fuel basically is still finite so it
 

3967
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:07,189
fuel basically is still finite so it
can't like push itself apart before the

3968
01:14:07,189 --> 01:14:07,199
can't like push itself apart before the
 

3969
01:14:07,199 --> 01:14:08,450
can't like push itself apart before the
fusion happens

3970
01:14:08,450 --> 01:14:08,460
fusion happens
 

3971
01:14:08,460 --> 01:14:11,689
fusion happens
oh wow so how do you make it so how do

3972
01:14:11,689 --> 01:14:11,699
oh wow so how do you make it so how do
 

3973
01:14:11,699 --> 01:14:13,490
oh wow so how do you make it so how do
you make it so fast this is why you use

3974
01:14:13,490 --> 01:14:13,500
you make it so fast this is why you use
 

3975
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:16,490
you make it so fast this is why you use
lasers because you're applying this

3976
01:14:16,490 --> 01:14:16,500
lasers because you're applying this
 

3977
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:18,890
lasers because you're applying this
energy in very very short periods of

3978
01:14:18,890 --> 01:14:18,900
energy in very very short periods of
 

3979
01:14:18,900 --> 01:14:20,510
energy in very very short periods of
time like under a fraction of a

3980
01:14:20,510 --> 01:14:20,520
time like under a fraction of a
 

3981
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:22,669
time like under a fraction of a
billionth of a second and so basically

3982
01:14:22,669 --> 01:14:22,679
billionth of a second and so basically
 

3983
01:14:22,679 --> 01:14:24,470
billionth of a second and so basically
that and then the force which is coming

3984
01:14:24,470 --> 01:14:24,480
that and then the force which is coming
 

3985
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:26,390
that and then the force which is coming
from this comes from the energy of the

3986
01:14:26,390 --> 01:14:26,400
from this comes from the energy of the
 

3987
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:28,550
from this comes from the energy of the
lasers which which is basically the

3988
01:14:28,550 --> 01:14:28,560
lasers which which is basically the
 

3989
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:30,770
lasers which which is basically the
rocket action which does the compression

3990
01:14:30,770 --> 01:14:30,780
rocket action which does the compression
 

3991
01:14:30,780 --> 01:14:33,410
rocket action which does the compression
which is the force is the inward facing

3992
01:14:33,410 --> 01:14:33,420
which is the force is the inward facing
 

3993
01:14:33,420 --> 01:14:35,689
which is the force is the inward facing
Force is is that is that increasing the

3994
01:14:35,689 --> 01:14:35,699
Force is is that is that increasing the
 

3995
01:14:35,699 --> 01:14:37,490
Force is is that is that increasing the
temperature no exponential you want to

3996
01:14:37,490 --> 01:14:37,500
temperature no exponential you want to
 

3997
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:39,830
temperature no exponential you want to
keep the fuel cold

3998
01:14:39,830 --> 01:14:39,840
keep the fuel cold
 

3999
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:42,290
keep the fuel cold
and then and just literally just ideally

4000
01:14:42,290 --> 01:14:42,300
and then and just literally just ideally
 

4001
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:44,570
and then and just literally just ideally
compress it and then in something which

4002
01:14:44,570 --> 01:14:44,580
compress it and then in something which
 

4003
01:14:44,580 --> 01:14:46,610
compress it and then in something which
is at the very center of that compressed

4004
01:14:46,610 --> 01:14:46,620
is at the very center of that compressed
 

4005
01:14:46,620 --> 01:14:49,010
is at the very center of that compressed
sphere because you've compressed it so

4006
01:14:49,010 --> 01:14:49,020
sphere because you've compressed it so
 

4007
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:51,050
sphere because you've compressed it so
rapidly the laws of physics basically

4008
01:14:51,050 --> 01:14:51,060
rapidly the laws of physics basically
 

4009
01:14:51,060 --> 01:14:53,149
rapidly the laws of physics basically
require for it to increase in

4010
01:14:53,149 --> 01:14:53,159
require for it to increase in
 

4011
01:14:53,159 --> 01:14:55,910
require for it to increase in
temperature so the the effect is like if

4012
01:14:55,910 --> 01:14:55,920
temperature so the the effect is like if
 

4013
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:58,130
temperature so the the effect is like if
you know the thing so adiabatic cooling

4014
01:14:58,130 --> 01:14:58,140
you know the thing so adiabatic cooling
 

4015
01:14:58,140 --> 01:14:59,810
you know the thing so adiabatic cooling
were actually fairly familiar with if

4016
01:14:59,810 --> 01:14:59,820
were actually fairly familiar with if
 

4017
01:14:59,820 --> 01:15:02,209
were actually fairly familiar with if
you take a spray can right and you push

4018
01:15:02,209 --> 01:15:02,219
you take a spray can right and you push
 

4019
01:15:02,219 --> 01:15:04,430
you take a spray can right and you push
the button when it when it rapidly

4020
01:15:04,430 --> 01:15:04,440
the button when it when it rapidly
 

4021
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:06,950
the button when it when it rapidly
expands it cools this is the nature of a

4022
01:15:06,950 --> 01:15:06,960
expands it cools this is the nature of a
 

4023
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:08,390
expands it cools this is the nature of a
lot of cooling technology we use

4024
01:15:08,390 --> 01:15:08,400
lot of cooling technology we use
 

4025
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:10,490
lot of cooling technology we use
actually well the opposite is true that

4026
01:15:10,490 --> 01:15:10,500
actually well the opposite is true that
 

4027
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:12,169
actually well the opposite is true that
if you would take all of those particles

4028
01:15:12,169 --> 01:15:12,179
if you would take all of those particles
 

4029
01:15:12,179 --> 01:15:14,330
if you would take all of those particles
and jam them together very fast back in

4030
01:15:14,330 --> 01:15:14,340
and jam them together very fast back in
 

4031
01:15:14,340 --> 01:15:16,250
and jam them together very fast back in
they want to heat up

4032
01:15:16,250 --> 01:15:16,260
they want to heat up
 

4033
01:15:16,260 --> 01:15:18,169
they want to heat up
and that's what happens and then what

4034
01:15:18,169 --> 01:15:18,179
and that's what happens and then what
 

4035
01:15:18,179 --> 01:15:21,350
and that's what happens and then what
happens is you you basically have this

4036
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:21,360
happens is you you basically have this
 

4037
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:24,350
happens is you you basically have this
very cold compressed set of Fusion fuel

4038
01:15:24,350 --> 01:15:24,360
very cold compressed set of Fusion fuel
 

4039
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:26,990
very cold compressed set of Fusion fuel
and at the center of this it goes to

4040
01:15:26,990 --> 01:15:27,000
and at the center of this it goes to
 

4041
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:30,110
and at the center of this it goes to
this 100 million degrees Celsius and so

4042
01:15:30,110 --> 01:15:30,120
this 100 million degrees Celsius and so
 

4043
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:31,610
this 100 million degrees Celsius and so
if it gets to that 100 million degrees

4044
01:15:31,610 --> 01:15:31,620
if it gets to that 100 million degrees
 

4045
01:15:31,620 --> 01:15:33,950
if it gets to that 100 million degrees
Celsius the Fusion fuel starts to burn

4046
01:15:33,950 --> 01:15:33,960
Celsius the Fusion fuel starts to burn
 

4047
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:36,110
Celsius the Fusion fuel starts to burn
and when that Fusion fuel starts to burn

4048
01:15:36,110 --> 01:15:36,120
and when that Fusion fuel starts to burn
 

4049
01:15:36,120 --> 01:15:38,209
and when that Fusion fuel starts to burn
it wants to heat up the other cold fuel

4050
01:15:38,209 --> 01:15:38,219
it wants to heat up the other cold fuel
 

4051
01:15:38,219 --> 01:15:39,830
it wants to heat up the other cold fuel
around it and it just basically

4052
01:15:39,830 --> 01:15:39,840
around it and it just basically
 

4053
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:42,110
around it and it just basically
propagates out so fast that what you

4054
01:15:42,110 --> 01:15:42,120
propagates out so fast that what you
 

4055
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:44,689
propagates out so fast that what you
would do ideally you would actually burn

4056
01:15:44,689 --> 01:15:44,699
would do ideally you would actually burn
 

4057
01:15:44,699 --> 01:15:46,729
would do ideally you would actually burn
in a fusion sense most of the fuel

4058
01:15:46,729 --> 01:15:46,739
in a fusion sense most of the fuel
 

4059
01:15:46,739 --> 01:15:48,830
in a fusion sense most of the fuel
that's in the pellet so this was very

4060
01:15:48,830 --> 01:15:48,840
that's in the pellet so this was very
 

4061
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:50,630
that's in the pellet so this was very
exciting because what they had done was

4062
01:15:50,630 --> 01:15:50,640
exciting because what they had done was
 

4063
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:53,270
exciting because what they had done was
they it's clear that they propagated

4064
01:15:53,270 --> 01:15:53,280
they it's clear that they propagated
 

4065
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:55,910
they it's clear that they propagated
this they got this what they call a hot

4066
01:15:55,910 --> 01:15:55,920
this they got this what they call a hot
 

4067
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:58,070
this they got this what they call a hot
spot and in fact that this heating can

4068
01:15:58,070 --> 01:15:58,080
spot and in fact that this heating can
 

4069
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:00,410
spot and in fact that this heating can
propagate it out into the fuel

4070
01:16:00,410 --> 01:16:00,420
propagate it out into the fuel
 

4071
01:16:00,420 --> 01:16:02,209
propagate it out into the fuel
um and that's that's the science behind

4072
01:16:02,209 --> 01:16:02,219
um and that's that's the science behind
 

4073
01:16:02,219 --> 01:16:04,669
um and that's that's the science behind
inertial Fusion so the idea behind a

4074
01:16:04,669 --> 01:16:04,679
inertial Fusion so the idea behind a
 

4075
01:16:04,679 --> 01:16:05,930
inertial Fusion so the idea behind a
reactor is based on this kind of

4076
01:16:05,930 --> 01:16:05,940
reactor is based on this kind of
 

4077
01:16:05,940 --> 01:16:10,010
reactor is based on this kind of
inertial uh uh confinement is that you

4078
01:16:10,010 --> 01:16:10,020
inertial uh uh confinement is that you
 

4079
01:16:10,020 --> 01:16:13,610
inertial uh uh confinement is that you
would what have a new BB every like 10

4080
01:16:13,610 --> 01:16:13,620
would what have a new BB every like 10
 

4081
01:16:13,620 --> 01:16:15,050
would what have a new BB every like 10
times a second or something like and

4082
01:16:15,050 --> 01:16:15,060
times a second or something like and
 

4083
01:16:15,060 --> 01:16:16,610
times a second or something like and
then there's some kind of yeah so

4084
01:16:16,610 --> 01:16:16,620
then there's some kind of yeah so
 

4085
01:16:16,620 --> 01:16:18,590
then there's some kind of yeah so
there's a incredible device that you

4086
01:16:18,590 --> 01:16:18,600
there's a incredible device that you
 

4087
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:20,689
there's a incredible device that you
kind of implied that kind of has to

4088
01:16:20,689 --> 01:16:20,699
kind of implied that kind of has to
 

4089
01:16:20,699 --> 01:16:22,729
kind of implied that kind of has to
create one of those BBS that did so you

4090
01:16:22,729 --> 01:16:22,739
create one of those BBS that did so you
 

4091
01:16:22,739 --> 01:16:25,189
create one of those BBS that did so you
have to make the BBS very fast there's

4092
01:16:25,189 --> 01:16:25,199
have to make the BBS very fast there's
 

4093
01:16:25,199 --> 01:16:27,169
have to make the BBS very fast there's
reports on this but about what what does

4094
01:16:27,169 --> 01:16:27,179
reports on this but about what what does
 

4095
01:16:27,179 --> 01:16:28,970
reports on this but about what what does
it mean you know the starting point is

4096
01:16:28,970 --> 01:16:28,980
it mean you know the starting point is
 

4097
01:16:28,980 --> 01:16:30,890
it mean you know the starting point is
can you make this game

4098
01:16:30,890 --> 01:16:30,900
can you make this game
 

4099
01:16:30,900 --> 01:16:33,410
can you make this game
so this was a scientific achievement

4100
01:16:33,410 --> 01:16:33,420
so this was a scientific achievement
 

4101
01:16:33,420 --> 01:16:35,030
so this was a scientific achievement
primarily because and the rest is just

4102
01:16:35,030 --> 01:16:35,040
primarily because and the rest is just
 

4103
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:37,550
primarily because and the rest is just
engineering no no no the rest is

4104
01:16:37,550 --> 01:16:37,560
engineering no no no the rest is
 

4105
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:39,649
engineering no no no the rest is
incredibly complicated engineering well

4106
01:16:39,649 --> 01:16:39,659
incredibly complicated engineering well
 

4107
01:16:39,659 --> 01:16:41,510
incredibly complicated engineering well
in fact there's still physics hurdles to

4108
01:16:41,510 --> 01:16:41,520
in fact there's still physics hurdles to
 

4109
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:43,729
in fact there's still physics hurdles to
overcome so so where does this come from

4110
01:16:43,729 --> 01:16:43,739
overcome so so where does this come from
 

4111
01:16:43,739 --> 01:16:45,590
overcome so so where does this come from
and it's actually because if you want to

4112
01:16:45,590 --> 01:16:45,600
and it's actually because if you want to
 

4113
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:48,530
and it's actually because if you want to
make an energy source out of this

4114
01:16:48,530 --> 01:16:48,540
make an energy source out of this
 

4115
01:16:48,540 --> 01:16:50,810
make an energy source out of this
um this had a gain of around 1.5 that

4116
01:16:50,810 --> 01:16:50,820
um this had a gain of around 1.5 that
 

4117
01:16:50,820 --> 01:16:52,610
um this had a gain of around 1.5 that
namely the Fusion Energy was

4118
01:16:52,610 --> 01:16:52,620
namely the Fusion Energy was
 

4119
01:16:52,620 --> 01:16:55,430
namely the Fusion Energy was
approximately was 1.5 times the the

4120
01:16:55,430 --> 01:16:55,440
approximately was 1.5 times the the
 

4121
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:57,410
approximately was 1.5 times the the
laser input energy okay this is a fairly

4122
01:16:57,410 --> 01:16:57,420
laser input energy okay this is a fairly
 

4123
01:16:57,420 --> 01:17:00,229
laser input energy okay this is a fairly
significant threshold however from the

4124
01:17:00,229 --> 01:17:00,239
significant threshold however from the
 

4125
01:17:00,239 --> 01:17:01,910
significant threshold however from the
from the science of what I just told you

4126
01:17:01,910 --> 01:17:01,920
from the science of what I just told you
 

4127
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:03,530
from the science of what I just told you
is that there's two fundamental

4128
01:17:03,530 --> 01:17:03,540
is that there's two fundamental
 

4129
01:17:03,540 --> 01:17:05,209
is that there's two fundamental
efficiencies which come into it which

4130
01:17:05,209 --> 01:17:05,219
efficiencies which come into it which
 

4131
01:17:05,219 --> 01:17:07,310
efficiencies which come into it which
really come from physics really one of

4132
01:17:07,310 --> 01:17:07,320
really come from physics really one of
 

4133
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:09,350
really come from physics really one of
them is hydrodynamic efficiency what I

4134
01:17:09,350 --> 01:17:09,360
them is hydrodynamic efficiency what I
 

4135
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:11,570
them is hydrodynamic efficiency what I
mean by this is that it's a rocket so

4136
01:17:11,570 --> 01:17:11,580
mean by this is that it's a rocket so
 

4137
01:17:11,580 --> 01:17:13,550
mean by this is that it's a rocket so
this just has a fundamental

4138
01:17:13,550 --> 01:17:13,560
this just has a fundamental
 

4139
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:17,149
this just has a fundamental
uh efficiency built into it which comes

4140
01:17:17,149 --> 01:17:17,159
uh efficiency built into it which comes
 

4141
01:17:17,159 --> 01:17:19,550
uh efficiency built into it which comes
out to orders of like 10 percent so this

4142
01:17:19,550 --> 01:17:19,560
out to orders of like 10 percent so this
 

4143
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:21,709
out to orders of like 10 percent so this
means is that your your ability to do

4144
01:17:21,709 --> 01:17:21,719
means is that your your ability to do
 

4145
01:17:21,719 --> 01:17:24,770
means is that your your ability to do
work on the system is just limited by

4146
01:17:24,770 --> 01:17:24,780
work on the system is just limited by
 

4147
01:17:24,780 --> 01:17:26,570
work on the system is just limited by
that okay and then the other one is the

4148
01:17:26,570 --> 01:17:26,580
that okay and then the other one is the
 

4149
01:17:26,580 --> 01:17:28,250
that okay and then the other one is the
efficiency of laser systems themselves

4150
01:17:28,250 --> 01:17:28,260
efficiency of laser systems themselves
 

4151
01:17:28,260 --> 01:17:30,350
efficiency of laser systems themselves
which if they're wall plug efficiency is

4152
01:17:30,350 --> 01:17:30,360
which if they're wall plug efficiency is
 

4153
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:32,930
which if they're wall plug efficiency is
10 you've done spectacularly well in

4154
01:17:32,930 --> 01:17:32,940
10 you've done spectacularly well in
 

4155
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:34,970
10 you've done spectacularly well in
fact the wall plug efficiency of the

4156
01:17:34,970 --> 01:17:34,980
fact the wall plug efficiency of the
 

4157
01:17:34,980 --> 01:17:36,590
fact the wall plug efficiency of the
ones using experiments are like more

4158
01:17:36,590 --> 01:17:36,600
ones using experiments are like more
 

4159
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:38,810
ones using experiments are like more
like one percent right so when you go

4160
01:17:38,810 --> 01:17:38,820
like one percent right so when you go
 

4161
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:41,270
like one percent right so when you go
through all of this the approximate you

4162
01:17:41,270 --> 01:17:41,280
through all of this the approximate you
 

4163
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:43,310
through all of this the approximate you
know place that you're ordering this is

4164
01:17:43,310 --> 01:17:43,320
know place that you're ordering this is
 

4165
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:46,010
know place that you're ordering this is
for for fusion power plant would be a

4166
01:17:46,010 --> 01:17:46,020
for for fusion power plant would be a
 

4167
01:17:46,020 --> 01:17:48,649
for for fusion power plant would be a
gain of a hundred not 1.5 so you still

4168
01:17:48,649 --> 01:17:48,659
gain of a hundred not 1.5 so you still
 

4169
01:17:48,659 --> 01:17:49,850
gain of a hundred not 1.5 so you still
you know and hopefully we see

4170
01:17:49,850 --> 01:17:49,860
you know and hopefully we see
 

4171
01:17:49,860 --> 01:17:51,770
you know and hopefully we see
experiments that keep climbing up

4172
01:17:51,770 --> 01:17:51,780
experiments that keep climbing up
 

4173
01:17:51,780 --> 01:17:54,410
experiments that keep climbing up
towards higher and higher gain but then

4174
01:17:54,410 --> 01:17:54,420
towards higher and higher gain but then
 

4175
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:56,450
towards higher and higher gain but then
the whole fusion power plant is a

4176
01:17:56,450 --> 01:17:56,460
the whole fusion power plant is a
 

4177
01:17:56,460 --> 01:17:59,330
the whole fusion power plant is a
totally different thing so it's not one

4178
01:17:59,330 --> 01:17:59,340
totally different thing so it's not one
 

4179
01:17:59,340 --> 01:18:02,870
totally different thing so it's not one
it's not one BB and one laser pulse per

4180
01:18:02,870 --> 01:18:02,880
it's not one BB and one laser pulse per
 

4181
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:05,450
it's not one BB and one laser pulse per
day it's like ten times five or ten

4182
01:18:05,450 --> 01:18:05,460
day it's like ten times five or ten
 

4183
01:18:05,460 --> 01:18:08,110
day it's like ten times five or ten
times per second like

4184
01:18:08,110 --> 01:18:08,120
times per second like
 

4185
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:11,450
times per second like
that right so you're doing it there and

4186
01:18:11,450 --> 01:18:11,460
that right so you're doing it there and
 

4187
01:18:11,460 --> 01:18:13,130
that right so you're doing it there and
then then and then comes the other

4188
01:18:13,130 --> 01:18:13,140
then then and then comes the other
 

4189
01:18:13,140 --> 01:18:15,110
then then and then comes the other
aspects so it's making the targets

4190
01:18:15,110 --> 01:18:15,120
aspects so it's making the targets
 

4191
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:17,810
aspects so it's making the targets
delivering them being able to repeatedly

4192
01:18:17,810 --> 01:18:17,820
delivering them being able to repeatedly
 

4193
01:18:17,820 --> 01:18:20,390
delivering them being able to repeatedly
get them to burn and then we haven't

4194
01:18:20,390 --> 01:18:20,400
get them to burn and then we haven't
 

4195
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:22,010
get them to burn and then we haven't
even talked about like how do you then

4196
01:18:22,010 --> 01:18:22,020
even talked about like how do you then
 

4197
01:18:22,020 --> 01:18:24,110
even talked about like how do you then
get the Fusion Energy out which is

4198
01:18:24,110 --> 01:18:24,120
get the Fusion Energy out which is
 

4199
01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:26,090
get the Fusion Energy out which is
mainly because these things are

4200
01:18:26,090 --> 01:18:26,100
mainly because these things are
 

4201
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:28,550
mainly because these things are
basically micro you know implosions

4202
01:18:28,550 --> 01:18:28,560
basically micro you know implosions
 

4203
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:30,770
basically micro you know implosions
which are occurring so this energy is

4204
01:18:30,770 --> 01:18:30,780
which are occurring so this energy is
 

4205
01:18:30,780 --> 01:18:32,870
which are occurring so this energy is
coming out to some medium on the outside

4206
01:18:32,870 --> 01:18:32,880
coming out to some medium on the outside
 

4207
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:34,250
coming out to some medium on the outside
that you've got to figure out how to

4208
01:18:34,250 --> 01:18:34,260
that you've got to figure out how to
 

4209
01:18:34,260 --> 01:18:36,350
that you've got to figure out how to
extract the energy out of this thing how

4210
01:18:36,350 --> 01:18:36,360
extract the energy out of this thing how
 

4211
01:18:36,360 --> 01:18:37,430
extract the energy out of this thing how
do you convert that energy to

4212
01:18:37,430 --> 01:18:37,440
do you convert that energy to
 

4213
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:40,250
do you convert that energy to
electricity so in the end you have to

4214
01:18:40,250 --> 01:18:40,260
electricity so in the end you have to
 

4215
01:18:40,260 --> 01:18:42,169
electricity so in the end you have to
basically convert it into heat in some

4216
01:18:42,169 --> 01:18:42,179
basically convert it into heat in some
 

4217
01:18:42,179 --> 01:18:44,630
basically convert it into heat in some
way so most of the pro what you in the

4218
01:18:44,630 --> 01:18:44,640
way so most of the pro what you in the
 

4219
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:46,490
way so most of the pro what you in the
end what Fusion makes mostly is like

4220
01:18:46,490 --> 01:18:46,500
end what Fusion makes mostly is like
 

4221
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:48,830
end what Fusion makes mostly is like
very energetic particles from the fusion

4222
01:18:48,830 --> 01:18:48,840
very energetic particles from the fusion
 

4223
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:50,990
very energetic particles from the fusion
reaction so you have to slow those down

4224
01:18:50,990 --> 01:18:51,000
reaction so you have to slow those down
 

4225
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,870
reaction so you have to slow those down
in some way and then make heat out of it

4226
01:18:53,870 --> 01:18:53,880
in some way and then make heat out of it
 

4227
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:55,850
in some way and then make heat out of it
so basically the conversion of the

4228
01:18:55,850 --> 01:18:55,860
so basically the conversion of the
 

4229
01:18:55,860 --> 01:18:57,590
so basically the conversion of the
kinetic energy of the particles into

4230
01:18:57,590 --> 01:18:57,600
kinetic energy of the particles into
 

4231
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:00,169
kinetic energy of the particles into
heating some engineered material that's

4232
01:19:00,169 --> 01:19:00,179
heating some engineered material that's
 

4233
01:19:00,179 --> 01:19:02,930
heating some engineered material that's
on the outside of this and that's from a

4234
01:19:02,930 --> 01:19:02,940
on the outside of this and that's from a
 

4235
01:19:02,940 --> 01:19:05,270
on the outside of this and that's from a
physics perspective is a somewhat solved

4236
01:19:05,270 --> 01:19:05,280
physics perspective is a somewhat solved
 

4237
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:07,090
physics perspective is a somewhat solved
problem but from an engineering is is

4238
01:19:07,090 --> 01:19:07,100
problem but from an engineering is is
 

4239
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:10,370
problem but from an engineering is is
still it's still yeah physics I can draw

4240
01:19:10,370 --> 01:19:10,380
still it's still yeah physics I can draw
 

4241
01:19:10,380 --> 01:19:11,930
still it's still yeah physics I can draw
the I can show you all the equations

4242
01:19:11,930 --> 01:19:11,940
the I can show you all the equations
 

4243
01:19:11,940 --> 01:19:13,610
the I can show you all the equations
that tell you about how it slows down

4244
01:19:13,610 --> 01:19:13,620
that tell you about how it slows down
 

4245
01:19:13,620 --> 01:19:16,250
that tell you about how it slows down
and converts kinetic energy into heat

4246
01:19:16,250 --> 01:19:16,260
and converts kinetic energy into heat
 

4247
01:19:16,260 --> 01:19:18,590
and converts kinetic energy into heat
and then what that heat means you know

4248
01:19:18,590 --> 01:19:18,600
and then what that heat means you know
 

4249
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:20,270
and then what that heat means you know
you can write out like an ideal thermal

4250
01:19:20,270 --> 01:19:20,280
you can write out like an ideal thermal
 

4251
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:22,189
you can write out like an ideal thermal
cycle like a carnosis so the physics of

4252
01:19:22,189 --> 01:19:22,199
cycle like a carnosis so the physics of
 

4253
01:19:22,199 --> 01:19:23,689
cycle like a carnosis so the physics of
that yeah great the integrated

4254
01:19:23,689 --> 01:19:23,699
that yeah great the integrated
 

4255
01:19:23,699 --> 01:19:26,090
that yeah great the integrated
engineering of this is a whole other

4256
01:19:26,090 --> 01:19:26,100
engineering of this is a whole other
 

4257
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:27,950
engineering of this is a whole other
thing a last case of maybe talk about

4258
01:19:27,950 --> 01:19:27,960
thing a last case of maybe talk about
 

4259
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:29,570
thing a last case of maybe talk about
the difference between a natural

4260
01:19:29,570 --> 01:19:29,580
the difference between a natural
 

4261
01:19:29,580 --> 01:19:31,490
the difference between a natural
magnetic uh but first we'll talk about

4262
01:19:31,490 --> 01:19:31,500
magnetic uh but first we'll talk about
 

4263
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:33,110
magnetic uh but first we'll talk about
magnetic but let me just Linger on this

4264
01:19:33,110 --> 01:19:33,120
magnetic but let me just Linger on this
 

4265
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:34,430
magnetic but let me just Linger on this
breakthrough you know it's nice to have

4266
01:19:34,430 --> 01:19:34,440
breakthrough you know it's nice to have
 

4267
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:36,290
breakthrough you know it's nice to have
exciting things but

4268
01:19:36,290 --> 01:19:36,300
exciting things but
 

4269
01:19:36,300 --> 01:19:38,810
exciting things but
in a deep human sense there's no

4270
01:19:38,810 --> 01:19:38,820
in a deep human sense there's no
 

4271
01:19:38,820 --> 01:19:40,430
in a deep human sense there's no
competition in science and engineering

4272
01:19:40,430 --> 01:19:40,440
competition in science and engineering
 

4273
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:43,070
competition in science and engineering
well like you said we were broad first

4274
01:19:43,070 --> 01:19:43,080
well like you said we were broad first
 

4275
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:45,110
well like you said we were broad first
of all we are a Humanity all together

4276
01:19:45,110 --> 01:19:45,120
of all we are a Humanity all together
 

4277
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:46,790
of all we are a Humanity all together
and you talk about this it's a bunch of

4278
01:19:46,790 --> 01:19:46,800
and you talk about this it's a bunch of
 

4279
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:48,530
and you talk about this it's a bunch of
countries collaborating it's it's really

4280
01:19:48,530 --> 01:19:48,540
countries collaborating it's it's really
 

4281
01:19:48,540 --> 01:19:51,110
countries collaborating it's it's really
exciting uh there's a nuclear fusion

4282
01:19:51,110 --> 01:19:51,120
exciting uh there's a nuclear fusion
 

4283
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:53,209
exciting uh there's a nuclear fusion
Community broadly but then there's also

4284
01:19:53,209 --> 01:19:53,219
Community broadly but then there's also
 

4285
01:19:53,219 --> 01:19:55,550
Community broadly but then there's also
MIT there's colors and logos and it's

4286
01:19:55,550 --> 01:19:55,560
MIT there's colors and logos and it's
 

4287
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:58,189
MIT there's colors and logos and it's
exciting and there's a that you uh you

4288
01:19:58,189 --> 01:19:58,199
exciting and there's a that you uh you
 

4289
01:19:58,199 --> 01:19:59,930
exciting and there's a that you uh you
have uh friends and colleagues here that

4290
01:19:59,930 --> 01:19:59,940
have uh friends and colleagues here that
 

4291
01:19:59,940 --> 01:20:01,790
have uh friends and colleagues here that
that work extremely hard and done some

4292
01:20:01,790 --> 01:20:01,800
that work extremely hard and done some
 

4293
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:04,189
that work extremely hard and done some
incredible stuff is there some sort of

4294
01:20:04,189 --> 01:20:04,199
incredible stuff is there some sort of
 

4295
01:20:04,199 --> 01:20:07,430
incredible stuff is there some sort of
how do you feel seeing somebody else uh

4296
01:20:07,430 --> 01:20:07,440
how do you feel seeing somebody else uh
 

4297
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:09,290
how do you feel seeing somebody else uh
get a breakthrough and uh using a

4298
01:20:09,290 --> 01:20:09,300
get a breakthrough and uh using a
 

4299
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:11,750
get a breakthrough and uh using a
different technology is that exciting uh

4300
01:20:11,750 --> 01:20:11,760
different technology is that exciting uh
 

4301
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:14,510
different technology is that exciting uh
is this does the competitive fire uh get

4302
01:20:14,510 --> 01:20:14,520
is this does the competitive fire uh get
 

4303
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:18,110
is this does the competitive fire uh get
uh all of the above I mean I mean the

4304
01:20:18,110 --> 01:20:18,120
uh all of the above I mean I mean the
 

4305
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:20,149
uh all of the above I mean I mean the
ignition you know I have so uh you know

4306
01:20:20,149 --> 01:20:20,159
ignition you know I have so uh you know
 

4307
01:20:20,159 --> 01:20:22,430
ignition you know I have so uh you know
to you know just to wave the wave the

4308
01:20:22,430 --> 01:20:22,440
to you know just to wave the wave the
 

4309
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:24,530
to you know just to wave the wave the
flag a little bit so MIT was a central

4310
01:20:24,530 --> 01:20:24,540
flag a little bit so MIT was a central
 

4311
01:20:24,540 --> 01:20:28,430
flag a little bit so MIT was a central
player in in this in this accomplishment

4312
01:20:28,430 --> 01:20:28,440
player in in this in this accomplishment
 

4313
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:30,770
player in in this in this accomplishment
um interesting I would say it showed our

4314
01:20:30,770 --> 01:20:30,780
um interesting I would say it showed our
 

4315
01:20:30,780 --> 01:20:32,810
um interesting I would say it showed our
two some of our two best traits so one

4316
01:20:32,810 --> 01:20:32,820
two some of our two best traits so one
 

4317
01:20:32,820 --> 01:20:34,669
two some of our two best traits so one
of them was that the

4318
01:20:34,669 --> 01:20:34,679
of them was that the
 

4319
01:20:34,679 --> 01:20:37,729
of them was that the
like how do you know that this happened

4320
01:20:37,729 --> 01:20:37,739
like how do you know that this happened
 

4321
01:20:37,739 --> 01:20:40,070
like how do you know that this happened
this measurement right so one of the

4322
01:20:40,070 --> 01:20:40,080
this measurement right so one of the
 

4323
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:42,530
this measurement right so one of the
ways to do this is if I told you is that

4324
01:20:42,530 --> 01:20:42,540
ways to do this is if I told you is that
 

4325
01:20:42,540 --> 01:20:45,050
ways to do this is if I told you is that
the in the DT Fusion what it actually

4326
01:20:45,050 --> 01:20:45,060
the in the DT Fusion what it actually
 

4327
01:20:45,060 --> 01:20:48,050
the in the DT Fusion what it actually
the product that comes out is helium I

4328
01:20:48,050 --> 01:20:48,060
the product that comes out is helium I
 

4329
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:50,330
the product that comes out is helium I
would call an alpha but it's helium

4330
01:20:50,330 --> 01:20:50,340
would call an alpha but it's helium
 

4331
01:20:50,340 --> 01:20:52,729
would call an alpha but it's helium
um and a free Neutron right so the

4332
01:20:52,729 --> 01:20:52,739
um and a free Neutron right so the
 

4333
01:20:52,739 --> 01:20:54,709
um and a free Neutron right so the
neutron contains 80 percent of the

4334
01:20:54,709 --> 01:20:54,719
neutron contains 80 percent of the
 

4335
01:20:54,719 --> 01:20:56,270
neutron contains 80 percent of the
fusion of the energy released by the

4336
01:20:56,270 --> 01:20:56,280
fusion of the energy released by the
 

4337
01:20:56,280 --> 01:20:58,430
fusion of the energy released by the
fusion reaction and it also because it

4338
01:20:58,430 --> 01:20:58,440
fusion reaction and it also because it
 

4339
01:20:58,440 --> 01:21:00,649
fusion reaction and it also because it
has lack it lacks a charge it basically

4340
01:21:00,649 --> 01:21:00,659
has lack it lacks a charge it basically
 

4341
01:21:00,659 --> 01:21:02,689
has lack it lacks a charge it basically
tends to just escape and go flying out

4342
01:21:02,689 --> 01:21:02,699
tends to just escape and go flying out
 

4343
01:21:02,699 --> 01:21:04,490
tends to just escape and go flying out
so this is what we would use eventually

4344
01:21:04,490 --> 01:21:04,500
so this is what we would use eventually
 

4345
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:05,450
so this is what we would use eventually
for

4346
01:21:05,450 --> 01:21:05,460
for
 

4347
01:21:05,460 --> 01:21:07,370
for
that's mostly what Fusion Energy would

4348
01:21:07,370 --> 01:21:07,380
that's mostly what Fusion Energy would
 

4349
01:21:07,380 --> 01:21:10,669
that's mostly what Fusion Energy would
be but so what um my my colleagues my

4350
01:21:10,669 --> 01:21:10,679
be but so what um my my colleagues my
 

4351
01:21:10,679 --> 01:21:12,770
be but so what um my my colleagues my
scientific colleagues at uh at the plaza

4352
01:21:12,770 --> 01:21:12,780
scientific colleagues at uh at the plaza
 

4353
01:21:12,780 --> 01:21:14,330
scientific colleagues at uh at the plaza
science Infusion Center built were

4354
01:21:14,330 --> 01:21:14,340
science Infusion Center built were
 

4355
01:21:14,340 --> 01:21:16,790
science Infusion Center built were
extraordinary measurement tools of being

4356
01:21:16,790 --> 01:21:16,800
extraordinary measurement tools of being
 

4357
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:19,550
extraordinary measurement tools of being
able to see the exact details of not

4358
01:21:19,550 --> 01:21:19,560
able to see the exact details of not
 

4359
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:21,410
able to see the exact details of not
only the number of neutrons that were

4360
01:21:21,410 --> 01:21:21,420
only the number of neutrons that were
 

4361
01:21:21,420 --> 01:21:23,689
only the number of neutrons that were
coming out but actually what energy that

4362
01:21:23,689 --> 01:21:23,699
coming out but actually what energy that
 

4363
01:21:23,699 --> 01:21:25,790
coming out but actually what energy that
they're at and by looking at that that

4364
01:21:25,790 --> 01:21:25,800
they're at and by looking at that that
 

4365
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:28,310
they're at and by looking at that that
configuration it reveals enormous I'm

4366
01:21:28,310 --> 01:21:28,320
configuration it reveals enormous I'm
 

4367
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:29,810
configuration it reveals enormous I'm
not gonna I'm not gonna scoop them

4368
01:21:29,810 --> 01:21:29,820
not gonna I'm not gonna scoop them
 

4369
01:21:29,820 --> 01:21:31,070
not gonna I'm not gonna scoop them
because they need to publish the paper

4370
01:21:31,070 --> 01:21:31,080
because they need to publish the paper
 

4371
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:34,250
because they need to publish the paper
but it it reveals enormous amounts of

4372
01:21:34,250 --> 01:21:34,260
but it it reveals enormous amounts of
 

4373
01:21:34,260 --> 01:21:36,110
but it it reveals enormous amounts of
scientific information about what's

4374
01:21:36,110 --> 01:21:36,120
scientific information about what's
 

4375
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:37,790
scientific information about what's
happening in that process that I just

4376
01:21:37,790 --> 01:21:37,800
happening in that process that I just
 

4377
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:40,910
happening in that process that I just
described so exciting I mean and I there

4378
01:21:40,910 --> 01:21:40,920
described so exciting I mean and I there
 

4379
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:42,950
described so exciting I mean and I there
you know I have colleagues there that

4380
01:21:42,950 --> 01:21:42,960
you know I have colleagues there that
 

4381
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:44,930
you know I have colleagues there that
have worked like for 30 years on this

4382
01:21:44,930 --> 01:21:44,940
have worked like for 30 years on this
 

4383
01:21:44,940 --> 01:21:47,270
have worked like for 30 years on this
for that moment of course you're excited

4384
01:21:47,270 --> 01:21:47,280
for that moment of course you're excited
 

4385
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:49,070
for that moment of course you're excited
for them I mean and there's one of those

4386
01:21:49,070 --> 01:21:49,080
for them I mean and there's one of those
 

4387
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:52,070
for them I mean and there's one of those
like there's there's nothing it's hard

4388
01:21:52,070 --> 01:21:52,080
like there's there's nothing it's hard
 

4389
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:53,990
like there's there's nothing it's hard
to describe to people who aren't they

4390
01:21:53,990 --> 01:21:54,000
to describe to people who aren't they
 

4391
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,270
to describe to people who aren't they
haven't it's like almost addicting to be

4392
01:21:56,270 --> 01:21:56,280
haven't it's like almost addicting to be
 

4393
01:21:56,280 --> 01:21:58,370
haven't it's like almost addicting to be
a scientist when you get to be at the

4394
01:21:58,370 --> 01:21:58,380
a scientist when you get to be at the
 

4395
01:21:58,380 --> 01:22:00,590
a scientist when you get to be at the
Forefront of research of anything like

4396
01:22:00,590 --> 01:22:00,600
Forefront of research of anything like
 

4397
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:03,770
Forefront of research of anything like
when you see like an actual discovery of

4398
01:22:03,770 --> 01:22:03,780
when you see like an actual discovery of
 

4399
01:22:03,780 --> 01:22:04,970
when you see like an actual discovery of
some kind and you're looking at it

4400
01:22:04,970 --> 01:22:04,980
some kind and you're looking at it
 

4401
01:22:04,980 --> 01:22:06,110
some kind and you're looking at it
particularly when you're are the person

4402
01:22:06,110 --> 01:22:06,120
particularly when you're are the person
 

4403
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:08,450
particularly when you're are the person
who did it right and you go no human

4404
01:22:08,450 --> 01:22:08,460
who did it right and you go no human
 

4405
01:22:08,460 --> 01:22:10,430
who did it right and you go no human
being has ever seen this or understood

4406
01:22:10,430 --> 01:22:10,440
being has ever seen this or understood
 

4407
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:12,410
being has ever seen this or understood
this it's like it's pretty thrilling

4408
01:22:12,410 --> 01:22:12,420
this it's like it's pretty thrilling
 

4409
01:22:12,420 --> 01:22:15,649
this it's like it's pretty thrilling
right so even even in proxy it's it's

4410
01:22:15,649 --> 01:22:15,659
right so even even in proxy it's it's
 

4411
01:22:15,659 --> 01:22:17,870
right so even even in proxy it's it's
incredibly thrilling to see this it's

4412
01:22:17,870 --> 01:22:17,880
incredibly thrilling to see this it's
 

4413
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:20,270
incredibly thrilling to see this it's
not I don't know it's rivalry or

4414
01:22:20,270 --> 01:22:20,280
not I don't know it's rivalry or
 

4415
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:22,130
not I don't know it's rivalry or
jealousy it's like I can tell you

4416
01:22:22,130 --> 01:22:22,140
jealousy it's like I can tell you
 

4417
01:22:22,140 --> 01:22:24,169
jealousy it's like I can tell you
already Fusion is really hard so

4418
01:22:24,169 --> 01:22:24,179
already Fusion is really hard so
 

4419
01:22:24,179 --> 01:22:25,970
already Fusion is really hard so
anything that keeps pushing the needle

4420
01:22:25,970 --> 01:22:25,980
anything that keeps pushing the needle
 

4421
01:22:25,980 --> 01:22:28,250
anything that keeps pushing the needle
forward is a good thing but we also have

4422
01:22:28,250 --> 01:22:28,260
forward is a good thing but we also have
 

4423
01:22:28,260 --> 01:22:30,050
forward is a good thing but we also have
to be realistic about what it means you

4424
01:22:30,050 --> 01:22:30,060
to be realistic about what it means you
 

4425
01:22:30,060 --> 01:22:31,669
to be realistic about what it means you
know to making a Fusion Energy System

4426
01:22:31,669 --> 01:22:31,679
know to making a Fusion Energy System
 

4427
01:22:31,679 --> 01:22:33,770
know to making a Fusion Energy System
that's that's and then but that's the

4428
01:22:33,770 --> 01:22:33,780
that's that's and then but that's the
 

4429
01:22:33,780 --> 01:22:35,990
that's that's and then but that's the
fun I mean these are the are still the

4430
01:22:35,990 --> 01:22:36,000
fun I mean these are the are still the
 

4431
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,149
fun I mean these are the are still the
early steps you maybe you can say the

4432
01:22:38,149 --> 01:22:38,159
early steps you maybe you can say the
 

4433
01:22:38,159 --> 01:22:39,950
early steps you maybe you can say the
early leaps uh

4434
01:22:39,950 --> 01:22:39,960
early leaps uh
 

4435
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:41,810
early leaps uh
so let's talk about the magnetic

4436
01:22:41,810 --> 01:22:41,820
so let's talk about the magnetic
 

4437
01:22:41,820 --> 01:22:45,950
so let's talk about the magnetic
confinement uh what is how does uh

4438
01:22:45,950 --> 01:22:45,960
confinement uh what is how does uh
 

4439
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:47,330
confinement uh what is how does uh
magnetic confinement work what's the

4440
01:22:47,330 --> 01:22:47,340
magnetic confinement work what's the
 

4441
01:22:47,340 --> 01:22:50,390
magnetic confinement work what's the
takamak uh yeah how does it all work so

4442
01:22:50,390 --> 01:22:50,400
takamak uh yeah how does it all work so
 

4443
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:51,830
takamak uh yeah how does it all work so
go back to that so why inertial

4444
01:22:51,830 --> 01:22:51,840
go back to that so why inertial
 

4445
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:53,510
go back to that so why inertial
confinement works on the same principle

4446
01:22:53,510 --> 01:22:53,520
confinement works on the same principle
 

4447
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:56,689
confinement works on the same principle
that a star works so like what is the

4448
01:22:56,689 --> 01:22:56,699
that a star works so like what is the
 

4449
01:22:56,699 --> 01:22:59,450
that a star works so like what is the
confinement mechanism in the star is

4450
01:22:59,450 --> 01:22:59,460
confinement mechanism in the star is
 

4451
01:22:59,460 --> 01:23:00,709
confinement mechanism in the star is
gravity

4452
01:23:00,709 --> 01:23:00,719
gravity
 

4453
01:23:00,719 --> 01:23:02,990
gravity
because it's it's it's it's its own

4454
01:23:02,990 --> 01:23:03,000
because it's it's it's it's its own
 

4455
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,990
because it's it's it's it's its own
inertia of the something the size of the

4456
01:23:05,990 --> 01:23:06,000
inertia of the something the size of the
 

4457
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,930
inertia of the something the size of the
sun basically pushes a literally a force

4458
01:23:08,930 --> 01:23:08,940
sun basically pushes a literally a force
 

4459
01:23:08,940 --> 01:23:11,570
sun basically pushes a literally a force
by gravity against the center so the

4460
01:23:11,570 --> 01:23:11,580
by gravity against the center so the
 

4461
01:23:11,580 --> 01:23:14,149
by gravity against the center so the
center is is very very hot 20 million

4462
01:23:14,149 --> 01:23:14,159
center is is very very hot 20 million
 

4463
01:23:14,159 --> 01:23:16,010
center is is very very hot 20 million
degrees and literally outside the sun

4464
01:23:16,010 --> 01:23:16,020
degrees and literally outside the sun
 

4465
01:23:16,020 --> 01:23:17,330
degrees and literally outside the sun
it's essentially zero because it's

4466
01:23:17,330 --> 01:23:17,340
it's essentially zero because it's
 

4467
01:23:17,340 --> 01:23:19,550
it's essentially zero because it's
vacuum of space how the hell does that

4468
01:23:19,550 --> 01:23:19,560
vacuum of space how the hell does that
 

4469
01:23:19,560 --> 01:23:22,250
vacuum of space how the hell does that
do that it does that by and is out of

4470
01:23:22,250 --> 01:23:22,260
do that it does that by and is out of
 

4471
01:23:22,260 --> 01:23:24,110
do that it does that by and is out of
through like why doesn't just leak all

4472
01:23:24,110 --> 01:23:24,120
through like why doesn't just leak all
 

4473
01:23:24,120 --> 01:23:25,669
through like why doesn't just leak all
of its heat it doesn't leak its heat

4474
01:23:25,669 --> 01:23:25,679
of its heat it doesn't leak its heat
 

4475
01:23:25,679 --> 01:23:28,070
of its heat it doesn't leak its heat
because it all held together by the fact

4476
01:23:28,070 --> 01:23:28,080
because it all held together by the fact
 

4477
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:29,689
because it all held together by the fact
that it can't escape because of its own

4478
01:23:29,689 --> 01:23:29,699
that it can't escape because of its own
 

4479
01:23:29,699 --> 01:23:31,430
that it can't escape because of its own
gravity so this is why the fusion

4480
01:23:31,430 --> 01:23:31,440
gravity so this is why the fusion
 

4481
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:33,290
gravity so this is why the fusion
happens in the center of the Tsar like

4482
01:23:33,290 --> 01:23:33,300
happens in the center of the Tsar like
 

4483
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:34,790
happens in the center of the Tsar like
we think of the surface of the Sun as

4484
01:23:34,790 --> 01:23:34,800
we think of the surface of the Sun as
 

4485
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:36,290
we think of the surface of the Sun as
being hot that's the coldest part of the

4486
01:23:36,290 --> 01:23:36,300
being hot that's the coldest part of the
 

4487
01:23:36,300 --> 01:23:38,330
being hot that's the coldest part of the
star so if our own sudden this is about

4488
01:23:38,330 --> 01:23:38,340
star so if our own sudden this is about
 

4489
01:23:38,340 --> 01:23:40,729
star so if our own sudden this is about
in 5500 degrees a beautiful Symmetry by

4490
01:23:40,729 --> 01:23:40,739
in 5500 degrees a beautiful Symmetry by
 

4491
01:23:40,739 --> 01:23:42,350
in 5500 degrees a beautiful Symmetry by
the way it's like so how do we know all

4492
01:23:42,350 --> 01:23:42,360
the way it's like so how do we know all
 

4493
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:44,450
the way it's like so how do we know all
this because we can't of course see

4494
01:23:44,450 --> 01:23:44,460
this because we can't of course see
 

4495
01:23:44,460 --> 01:23:47,270
this because we can't of course see
directly into the interior of the Sun by

4496
01:23:47,270 --> 01:23:47,280
directly into the interior of the Sun by
 

4497
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:49,010
directly into the interior of the Sun by
knowing the volume and the temperature

4498
01:23:49,010 --> 01:23:49,020
knowing the volume and the temperature
 

4499
01:23:49,020 --> 01:23:50,510
knowing the volume and the temperature
of the surface of the Sun you know

4500
01:23:50,510 --> 01:23:50,520
of the surface of the Sun you know
 

4501
01:23:50,520 --> 01:23:52,010
of the surface of the Sun you know
exactly how much power it's putting out

4502
01:23:52,010 --> 01:23:52,020
exactly how much power it's putting out
 

4503
01:23:52,020 --> 01:23:54,229
exactly how much power it's putting out
and by this you you know that this is

4504
01:23:54,229 --> 01:23:54,239
and by this you you know that this is
 

4505
01:23:54,239 --> 01:23:55,910
and by this you you know that this is
coming from Fusion reactions occurring

4506
01:23:55,910 --> 01:23:55,920
coming from Fusion reactions occurring
 

4507
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:58,430
coming from Fusion reactions occurring
at exactly the same rate in the middle

4508
01:23:58,430 --> 01:23:58,440
at exactly the same rate in the middle
 

4509
01:23:58,440 --> 01:24:00,110
at exactly the same rate in the middle
of the Sun

4510
01:24:00,110 --> 01:24:00,120
of the Sun
 

4511
01:24:00,120 --> 01:24:03,110
of the Sun
is it possible as a small tangent to

4512
01:24:03,110 --> 01:24:03,120
is it possible as a small tangent to
 

4513
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:07,189
is it possible as a small tangent to
build uh an inertial confinement system

4514
01:24:07,189 --> 01:24:07,199
build uh an inertial confinement system
 

4515
01:24:07,199 --> 01:24:09,169
build uh an inertial confinement system
like the sun is it possible to create a

4516
01:24:09,169 --> 01:24:09,179
like the sun is it possible to create a
 

4517
01:24:09,179 --> 01:24:11,030
like the sun is it possible to create a
sun it is of course possible to make a

4518
01:24:11,030 --> 01:24:11,040
sun it is of course possible to make a
 

4519
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:13,130
sun it is of course possible to make a
sun although he's even have stars but it

4520
01:24:13,130 --> 01:24:13,140
sun although he's even have stars but it
 

4521
01:24:13,140 --> 01:24:15,410
sun although he's even have stars but it
is not impossible on Earth because for

4522
01:24:15,410 --> 01:24:15,420
is not impossible on Earth because for
 

4523
01:24:15,420 --> 01:24:17,570
is not impossible on Earth because for
the simple reason that it takes the

4524
01:24:17,570 --> 01:24:17,580
the simple reason that it takes the
 

4525
01:24:17,580 --> 01:24:19,610
the simple reason that it takes the
gravitational force is extremely weak

4526
01:24:19,610 --> 01:24:19,620
gravitational force is extremely weak
 

4527
01:24:19,620 --> 01:24:21,530
gravitational force is extremely weak
and so it takes something like the size

4528
01:24:21,530 --> 01:24:21,540
and so it takes something like the size
 

4529
01:24:21,540 --> 01:24:24,050
and so it takes something like the size
of a star to make fusion occur in the

4530
01:24:24,050 --> 01:24:24,060
of a star to make fusion occur in the
 

4531
01:24:24,060 --> 01:24:26,390
of a star to make fusion occur in the
center well I I didn't mean on Earth I

4532
01:24:26,390 --> 01:24:26,400
center well I I didn't mean on Earth I
 

4533
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:28,189
center well I I didn't mean on Earth I
mean if you had to build like a second

4534
01:24:28,189 --> 01:24:28,199
mean if you had to build like a second
 

4535
01:24:28,199 --> 01:24:30,350
mean if you had to build like a second
sun how did you do it you can't there's

4536
01:24:30,350 --> 01:24:30,360
sun how did you do it you can't there's
 

4537
01:24:30,360 --> 01:24:32,810
sun how did you do it you can't there's
not enough hydrogen around yeah so the

4538
01:24:32,810 --> 01:24:32,820
not enough hydrogen around yeah so the
 

4539
01:24:32,820 --> 01:24:35,390
not enough hydrogen around yeah so the
the limiting factor is the the just the

4540
01:24:35,390 --> 01:24:35,400
the limiting factor is the the just the
 

4541
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:38,030
the limiting factor is the the just the
hydrogen yeah I mean the the forces that

4542
01:24:38,030 --> 01:24:38,040
hydrogen yeah I mean the the forces that
 

4543
01:24:38,040 --> 01:24:39,890
hydrogen yeah I mean the the forces that
an energy that it takes to assemble that

4544
01:24:39,890 --> 01:24:39,900
an energy that it takes to assemble that
 

4545
01:24:39,900 --> 01:24:43,490
an energy that it takes to assemble that
is just mind-boggling all right so we

4546
01:24:43,490 --> 01:24:43,500
is just mind-boggling all right so we
 

4547
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:45,169
is just mind-boggling all right so we
would do that to be continued yeah to be

4548
01:24:45,169 --> 01:24:45,179
would do that to be continued yeah to be
 

4549
01:24:45,179 --> 01:24:46,610
would do that to be continued yeah to be
continuous so what are we doing it with

4550
01:24:46,610 --> 01:24:46,620
continuous so what are we doing it with
 

4551
01:24:46,620 --> 01:24:48,229
continuous so what are we doing it with
so in the one that I just described it's

4552
01:24:48,229 --> 01:24:48,239
so in the one that I just described it's
 

4553
01:24:48,239 --> 01:24:49,790
so in the one that I just described it's
like you say so you have to replace this

4554
01:24:49,790 --> 01:24:49,800
like you say so you have to replace this
 

4555
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:52,130
like you say so you have to replace this
with some Force which is better than

4556
01:24:52,130 --> 01:24:52,140
with some Force which is better than
 

4557
01:24:52,140 --> 01:24:54,770
with some Force which is better than
that and so what I'd mean by is it's

4558
01:24:54,770 --> 01:24:54,780
that and so what I'd mean by is it's
 

4559
01:24:54,780 --> 01:24:56,990
that and so what I'd mean by is it's
it's stronger than that so when I talked

4560
01:24:56,990 --> 01:24:57,000
it's stronger than that so when I talked
 

4561
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,209
it's stronger than that so when I talked
about the laser Fusion this is coming

4562
01:24:59,209 --> 01:24:59,219
about the laser Fusion this is coming
 

4563
01:24:59,219 --> 01:25:01,070
about the laser Fusion this is coming
from the force which is enormous

4564
01:25:01,070 --> 01:25:01,080
from the force which is enormous
 

4565
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:03,169
from the force which is enormous
compared to gravity like like from the

4566
01:25:03,169 --> 01:25:03,179
compared to gravity like like from the
 

4567
01:25:03,179 --> 01:25:05,209
compared to gravity like like from the
rocket action of pushing it together

4568
01:25:05,209 --> 01:25:05,219
rocket action of pushing it together
 

4569
01:25:05,219 --> 01:25:07,310
rocket action of pushing it together
so in magnetic confinement

4570
01:25:07,310 --> 01:25:07,320
so in magnetic confinement
 

4571
01:25:07,320 --> 01:25:09,290
so in magnetic confinement
we use another force of nature which is

4572
01:25:09,290 --> 01:25:09,300
we use another force of nature which is
 

4573
01:25:09,300 --> 01:25:11,990
we use another force of nature which is
the electromagnetic force and that's

4574
01:25:11,990 --> 01:25:12,000
the electromagnetic force and that's
 

4575
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,510
the electromagnetic force and that's
very it's orders and Orders of magnitude

4576
01:25:14,510 --> 01:25:14,520
very it's orders and Orders of magnitude
 

4577
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:17,390
very it's orders and Orders of magnitude
stronger than the gravitational force

4578
01:25:17,390 --> 01:25:17,400
stronger than the gravitational force
 

4579
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:19,550
stronger than the gravitational force
and the key force that matters here is

4580
01:25:19,550 --> 01:25:19,560
and the key force that matters here is
 

4581
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:21,530
and the key force that matters here is
that if you have a Charged particle that

4582
01:25:21,530 --> 01:25:21,540
that if you have a Charged particle that
 

4583
01:25:21,540 --> 01:25:23,149
that if you have a Charged particle that
namely it's a particle that has an

4584
01:25:23,149 --> 01:25:23,159
namely it's a particle that has an
 

4585
01:25:23,159 --> 01:25:25,669
namely it's a particle that has an
electric net electric charge and it's in

4586
01:25:25,669 --> 01:25:25,679
electric net electric charge and it's in
 

4587
01:25:25,679 --> 01:25:28,430
electric net electric charge and it's in
the proximity of a magnetic field then

4588
01:25:28,430 --> 01:25:28,440
the proximity of a magnetic field then
 

4589
01:25:28,440 --> 01:25:30,709
the proximity of a magnetic field then
there is a force which is exerted on

4590
01:25:30,709 --> 01:25:30,719
there is a force which is exerted on
 

4591
01:25:30,719 --> 01:25:32,149
there is a force which is exerted on
that particle

4592
01:25:32,149 --> 01:25:32,159
that particle
 

4593
01:25:32,159 --> 01:25:34,490
that particle
so this is called the Lowrance Force for

4594
01:25:34,490 --> 01:25:34,500
so this is called the Lowrance Force for
 

4595
01:25:34,500 --> 01:25:36,530
so this is called the Lowrance Force for
those who are keeping track so that is

4596
01:25:36,530 --> 01:25:36,540
those who are keeping track so that is
 

4597
01:25:36,540 --> 01:25:38,630
those who are keeping track so that is
the force that we use to replace

4598
01:25:38,630 --> 01:25:38,640
the force that we use to replace
 

4599
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:40,550
the force that we use to replace
physical containment

4600
01:25:40,550 --> 01:25:40,560
physical containment
 

4601
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:43,790
physical containment
so and so this again confuses how do you

4602
01:25:43,790 --> 01:25:43,800
so and so this again confuses how do you
 

4603
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:45,470
so and so this again confuses how do you
hold something at 100 million degrees

4604
01:25:45,470 --> 01:25:45,480
hold something at 100 million degrees
 

4605
01:25:45,480 --> 01:25:48,110
hold something at 100 million degrees
it's impossible in a physical container

4606
01:25:48,110 --> 01:25:48,120
it's impossible in a physical container
 

4607
01:25:48,120 --> 01:25:50,510
it's impossible in a physical container
this is not like you know it's not this

4608
01:25:50,510 --> 01:25:50,520
this is not like you know it's not this
 

4609
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:52,850
this is not like you know it's not this
plastic bottle holding in this liquid or

4610
01:25:52,850 --> 01:25:52,860
plastic bottle holding in this liquid or
 

4611
01:25:52,860 --> 01:25:55,310
plastic bottle holding in this liquid or
a gas chamber what you're doing is

4612
01:25:55,310 --> 01:25:55,320
a gas chamber what you're doing is
 

4613
01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:57,169
a gas chamber what you're doing is
they're using and you're immersing the

4614
01:25:57,169 --> 01:25:57,179
they're using and you're immersing the
 

4615
01:25:57,179 --> 01:26:00,110
they're using and you're immersing the
fuel in a magnetic field that it

4616
01:26:00,110 --> 01:26:00,120
fuel in a magnetic field that it
 

4617
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:02,270
fuel in a magnetic field that it
basically exerts a force at a distance

4618
01:26:02,270 --> 01:26:02,280
basically exerts a force at a distance
 

4619
01:26:02,280 --> 01:26:04,189
basically exerts a force at a distance
this comes back again to again like why

4620
01:26:04,189 --> 01:26:04,199
this comes back again to again like why
 

4621
01:26:04,199 --> 01:26:06,410
this comes back again to again like why
plazas are so strange it's the same

4622
01:26:06,410 --> 01:26:06,420
plazas are so strange it's the same
 

4623
01:26:06,420 --> 01:26:08,030
plazas are so strange it's the same
thing here and if it's immersed in this

4624
01:26:08,030 --> 01:26:08,040
thing here and if it's immersed in this
 

4625
01:26:08,040 --> 01:26:09,410
thing here and if it's immersed in this
magnetic field you're not actually

4626
01:26:09,410 --> 01:26:09,420
magnetic field you're not actually
 

4627
01:26:09,420 --> 01:26:11,689
magnetic field you're not actually
physically touching it but you're making

4628
01:26:11,689 --> 01:26:11,699
physically touching it but you're making
 

4629
01:26:11,699 --> 01:26:13,970
physically touching it but you're making
a force go onto it so that's the and

4630
01:26:13,970 --> 01:26:13,980
a force go onto it so that's the and
 

4631
01:26:13,980 --> 01:26:16,490
a force go onto it so that's the and
that's the inherent feature of of

4632
01:26:16,490 --> 01:26:16,500
that's the inherent feature of of
 

4633
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:19,610
that's the inherent feature of of
magnetic confinement and then magnetic

4634
01:26:19,610 --> 01:26:19,620
magnetic confinement and then magnetic
 

4635
01:26:19,620 --> 01:26:21,649
magnetic confinement and then magnetic
confinement devices are like a Toca Mac

4636
01:26:21,649 --> 01:26:21,659
confinement devices are like a Toca Mac
 

4637
01:26:21,659 --> 01:26:24,470
confinement devices are like a Toca Mac
are basically uh configurations which

4638
01:26:24,470 --> 01:26:24,480
are basically uh configurations which
 

4639
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:26,689
are basically uh configurations which
exploit the features of that magnetic

4640
01:26:26,689 --> 01:26:26,699
exploit the features of that magnetic
 

4641
01:26:26,699 --> 01:26:28,790
exploit the features of that magnetic
containment there's several features to

4642
01:26:28,790 --> 01:26:28,800
containment there's several features to
 

4643
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:31,070
containment there's several features to
it one is that the stronger the strength

4644
01:26:31,070 --> 01:26:31,080
it one is that the stronger the strength
 

4645
01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:32,689
it one is that the stronger the strength
of the magnetic field the stronger the

4646
01:26:32,689 --> 01:26:32,699
of the magnetic field the stronger the
 

4647
01:26:32,699 --> 01:26:33,950
of the magnetic field the stronger the
force

4648
01:26:33,950 --> 01:26:33,960
force
 

4649
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:36,110
force
and for this reason is that if you

4650
01:26:36,110 --> 01:26:36,120
and for this reason is that if you
 

4651
01:26:36,120 --> 01:26:38,090
and for this reason is that if you
increase the strength of magnetic fields

4652
01:26:38,090 --> 01:26:38,100
increase the strength of magnetic fields
 

4653
01:26:38,100 --> 01:26:40,669
increase the strength of magnetic fields
this means that the containment because

4654
01:26:40,669 --> 01:26:40,679
this means that the containment because
 

4655
01:26:40,679 --> 01:26:42,110
this means that the containment because
namely the force which you're pushing

4656
01:26:42,110 --> 01:26:42,120
namely the force which you're pushing
 

4657
01:26:42,120 --> 01:26:43,970
namely the force which you're pushing
against it is more effective

4658
01:26:43,970 --> 01:26:43,980
against it is more effective
 

4659
01:26:43,980 --> 01:26:46,729
against it is more effective
and the other feature is that there is

4660
01:26:46,729 --> 01:26:46,739
and the other feature is that there is
 

4661
01:26:46,739 --> 01:26:50,030
and the other feature is that there is
no Force so for those magnetic fields

4662
01:26:50,030 --> 01:26:50,040
no Force so for those magnetic fields
 

4663
01:26:50,040 --> 01:26:51,470
no Force so for those magnetic fields
what are these things they're also

4664
01:26:51,470 --> 01:26:51,480
what are these things they're also
 

4665
01:26:51,480 --> 01:26:53,870
what are these things they're also
invisible but you know if you think of a

4666
01:26:53,870 --> 01:26:53,880
invisible but you know if you think of a
 

4667
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:55,610
invisible but you know if you think of a
permanent magnets or your fridge magnet

4668
01:26:55,610 --> 01:26:55,620
permanent magnets or your fridge magnet
 

4669
01:26:55,620 --> 01:26:58,010
permanent magnets or your fridge magnet
there are there are field lines which we

4670
01:26:58,010 --> 01:26:58,020
there are there are field lines which we
 

4671
01:26:58,020 --> 01:26:59,450
there are there are field lines which we
actually designate as arrows which are

4672
01:26:59,450 --> 01:26:59,460
actually designate as arrows which are
 

4673
01:26:59,460 --> 01:27:01,430
actually designate as arrows which are
going around you sometimes see this in

4674
01:27:01,430 --> 01:27:01,440
going around you sometimes see this in
 

4675
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:03,590
going around you sometimes see this in
school when you have the you know the

4676
01:27:03,590 --> 01:27:03,600
school when you have the you know the
 

4677
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:05,570
school when you have the you know the
iron filings on a thing and you see the

4678
01:27:05,570 --> 01:27:05,580
iron filings on a thing and you see the
 

4679
01:27:05,580 --> 01:27:07,189
iron filings on a thing and you see the
directions of the magnetic field lines

4680
01:27:07,189 --> 01:27:07,199
directions of the magnetic field lines
 

4681
01:27:07,199 --> 01:27:09,950
directions of the magnetic field lines
or or when you use a compass right so

4682
01:27:09,950 --> 01:27:09,960
or or when you use a compass right so
 

4683
01:27:09,960 --> 01:27:11,810
or or when you use a compass right so
that's telling you nor because we're

4684
01:27:11,810 --> 01:27:11,820
that's telling you nor because we're
 

4685
01:27:11,820 --> 01:27:13,790
that's telling you nor because we're
living in an immersed magnetic field

4686
01:27:13,790 --> 01:27:13,800
living in an immersed magnetic field
 

4687
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:16,129
living in an immersed magnetic field
made by the Earth which is at very low

4688
01:27:16,129 --> 01:27:16,139
made by the Earth which is at very low
 

4689
01:27:16,139 --> 01:27:17,629
made by the Earth which is at very low
intensity magnetic but it's strong

4690
01:27:17,629 --> 01:27:17,639
intensity magnetic but it's strong
 

4691
01:27:17,639 --> 01:27:18,709
intensity magnetic but it's strong
enough we can actually see what

4692
01:27:18,709 --> 01:27:18,719
enough we can actually see what
 

4693
01:27:18,719 --> 01:27:20,750
enough we can actually see what
direction is so this is the arrow that

4694
01:27:20,750 --> 01:27:20,760
direction is so this is the arrow that
 

4695
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:22,430
direction is so this is the arrow that
the magnetic field is pointing it's

4696
01:27:22,430 --> 01:27:22,440
the magnetic field is pointing it's
 

4697
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:25,129
the magnetic field is pointing it's
always pointing North and for us is that

4698
01:27:25,129 --> 01:27:25,139
always pointing North and for us is that
 

4699
01:27:25,139 --> 01:27:27,169
always pointing North and for us is that
so an interesting feature of this force

4700
01:27:27,169 --> 01:27:27,179
so an interesting feature of this force
 

4701
01:27:27,179 --> 01:27:29,209
so an interesting feature of this force
is that there is no Force along the

4702
01:27:29,209 --> 01:27:29,219
is that there is no Force along the
 

4703
01:27:29,219 --> 01:27:31,250
is that there is no Force along the
direction of the magnetic field there's

4704
01:27:31,250 --> 01:27:31,260
direction of the magnetic field there's
 

4705
01:27:31,260 --> 01:27:33,410
direction of the magnetic field there's
only force in the directions orthogonal

4706
01:27:33,410 --> 01:27:33,420
only force in the directions orthogonal
 

4707
01:27:33,420 --> 01:27:35,990
only force in the directions orthogonal
to the magnetic field so this by the way

4708
01:27:35,990 --> 01:27:36,000
to the magnetic field so this by the way
 

4709
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:39,410
to the magnetic field so this by the way
is a huge deal in in in in in in a whole

4710
01:27:39,410 --> 01:27:39,420
is a huge deal in in in in in in a whole
 

4711
01:27:39,420 --> 01:27:41,209
is a huge deal in in in in in in a whole
other discipline of plasma physics which

4712
01:27:41,209 --> 01:27:41,219
other discipline of plasma physics which
 

4713
01:27:41,219 --> 01:27:43,189
other discipline of plasma physics which
is like that the study of like our near

4714
01:27:43,189 --> 01:27:43,199
is like that the study of like our near
 

4715
01:27:43,199 --> 01:27:45,350
is like that the study of like our near
atmosphere so the study of aurora

4716
01:27:45,350 --> 01:27:45,360
atmosphere so the study of aurora
 

4717
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:47,450
atmosphere so the study of aurora
borealis what's happening in the near

4718
01:27:47,450 --> 01:27:47,460
borealis what's happening in the near
 

4719
01:27:47,460 --> 01:27:49,010
borealis what's happening in the near
atmosphere what happens when solar

4720
01:27:49,010 --> 01:27:49,020
atmosphere what happens when solar
 

4721
01:27:49,020 --> 01:27:51,470
atmosphere what happens when solar
flares hit the magnetic in fact

4722
01:27:51,470 --> 01:27:51,480
flares hit the magnetic in fact
 

4723
01:27:51,480 --> 01:27:53,870
flares hit the magnetic in fact
remember I said Fusion is the reason

4724
01:27:53,870 --> 01:27:53,880
remember I said Fusion is the reason
 

4725
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:55,910
remember I said Fusion is the reason
that life is responsible

4726
01:27:55,910 --> 01:27:55,920
that life is responsible
 

4727
01:27:55,920 --> 01:27:57,709
that life is responsible
in the universe where you could also

4728
01:27:57,709 --> 01:27:57,719
in the universe where you could also
 

4729
01:27:57,719 --> 01:27:59,890
in the universe where you could also
argue so is magnetic confinement because

4730
01:27:59,890 --> 01:27:59,900
argue so is magnetic confinement because
 

4731
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:02,750
argue so is magnetic confinement because
the the charged particles which are

4732
01:28:02,750 --> 01:28:02,760
the the charged particles which are
 

4733
01:28:02,760 --> 01:28:05,570
the the charged particles which are
being emitted from from the Galaxy and

4734
01:28:05,570 --> 01:28:05,580
being emitted from from the Galaxy and
 

4735
01:28:05,580 --> 01:28:07,850
being emitted from from the Galaxy and
from our own star would be very very

4736
01:28:07,850 --> 01:28:07,860
from our own star would be very very
 

4737
01:28:07,860 --> 01:28:10,970
from our own star would be very very
damaging to on Earth so we get two

4738
01:28:10,970 --> 01:28:10,980
damaging to on Earth so we get two
 

4739
01:28:10,980 --> 01:28:12,410
damaging to on Earth so we get two
layers of protection one is the

4740
01:28:12,410 --> 01:28:12,420
layers of protection one is the
 

4741
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:14,450
layers of protection one is the
atmosphere itself but the other one is

4742
01:28:14,450 --> 01:28:14,460
atmosphere itself but the other one is
 

4743
01:28:14,460 --> 01:28:16,490
atmosphere itself but the other one is
the magnetic field which surrounds the

4744
01:28:16,490 --> 01:28:16,500
the magnetic field which surrounds the
 

4745
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:18,590
the magnetic field which surrounds the
Earth and basically traps these charged

4746
01:28:18,590 --> 01:28:18,600
Earth and basically traps these charged
 

4747
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:20,030
Earth and basically traps these charged
particles so they can't get away it's

4748
01:28:20,030 --> 01:28:20,040
particles so they can't get away it's
 

4749
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:21,530
particles so they can't get away it's
the same it's the same it's the same

4750
01:28:21,530 --> 01:28:21,540
the same it's the same it's the same
 

4751
01:28:21,540 --> 01:28:23,450
the same it's the same it's the same
deal how do you create a strong magnetic

4752
01:28:23,450 --> 01:28:23,460
deal how do you create a strong magnetic
 

4753
01:28:23,460 --> 01:28:27,410
deal how do you create a strong magnetic
field yeah so with a giant magnet giant

4754
01:28:27,410 --> 01:28:27,420
field yeah so with a giant magnet giant
 

4755
01:28:27,420 --> 01:28:30,470
field yeah so with a giant magnet giant
magnet yeah so it's it's basically true

4756
01:28:30,470 --> 01:28:30,480
magnet yeah so it's it's basically true
 

4757
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:32,149
magnet yeah so it's it's basically true
engineering there's essentially there's

4758
01:28:32,149 --> 01:28:32,159
engineering there's essentially there's
 

4759
01:28:32,159 --> 01:28:34,010
engineering there's essentially there's
essentially two ways to create a magnet

4760
01:28:34,010 --> 01:28:34,020
essentially two ways to create a magnet
 

4761
01:28:34,020 --> 01:28:35,810
essentially two ways to create a magnet
so one of them is that we're familiar

4762
01:28:35,810 --> 01:28:35,820
so one of them is that we're familiar
 

4763
01:28:35,820 --> 01:28:37,189
so one of them is that we're familiar
with like fridge magnets and so forth

4764
01:28:37,189 --> 01:28:37,199
with like fridge magnets and so forth
 

4765
01:28:37,199 --> 01:28:38,810
with like fridge magnets and so forth
these are so-called permanent magnets

4766
01:28:38,810 --> 01:28:38,820
these are so-called permanent magnets
 

4767
01:28:38,820 --> 01:28:41,390
these are so-called permanent magnets
and what it means is that Within These

4768
01:28:41,390 --> 01:28:41,400
and what it means is that Within These
 

4769
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:43,070
and what it means is that Within These
the atoms arranged in a particular way

4770
01:28:43,070 --> 01:28:43,080
the atoms arranged in a particular way
 

4771
01:28:43,080 --> 01:28:44,870
the atoms arranged in a particular way
that it produces the electrons basically

4772
01:28:44,870 --> 01:28:44,880
that it produces the electrons basically
 

4773
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:46,970
that it produces the electrons basically
arranged in a particular way that it

4774
01:28:46,970 --> 01:28:46,980
arranged in a particular way that it
 

4775
01:28:46,980 --> 01:28:49,129
arranged in a particular way that it
produces a permanent magnetic field that

4776
01:28:49,129 --> 01:28:49,139
produces a permanent magnetic field that
 

4777
01:28:49,139 --> 01:28:52,310
produces a permanent magnetic field that
is set by the material so those 10 those

4778
01:28:52,310 --> 01:28:52,320
is set by the material so those 10 those
 

4779
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:54,229
is set by the material so those 10 those
have a fundamental limitation how strong

4780
01:28:54,229 --> 01:28:54,239
have a fundamental limitation how strong
 

4781
01:28:54,239 --> 01:28:55,790
have a fundamental limitation how strong
they can be and they also tend to have

4782
01:28:55,790 --> 01:28:55,800
they can be and they also tend to have
 

4783
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:58,850
they can be and they also tend to have
this like circular shape like this so we

4784
01:28:58,850 --> 01:28:58,860
this like circular shape like this so we
 

4785
01:28:58,860 --> 01:29:00,530
this like circular shape like this so we
don't use we don't typically use those

4786
01:29:00,530 --> 01:29:00,540
don't use we don't typically use those
 

4787
01:29:00,540 --> 01:29:02,390
don't use we don't typically use those
so what we use are so-called

4788
01:29:02,390 --> 01:29:02,400
so what we use are so-called
 

4789
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:04,250
so what we use are so-called
electromagnets and what is this it's

4790
01:29:04,250 --> 01:29:04,260
electromagnets and what is this it's
 

4791
01:29:04,260 --> 01:29:06,590
electromagnets and what is this it's
like um so the other way to make a

4792
01:29:06,590 --> 01:29:06,600
like um so the other way to make a
 

4793
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:08,270
like um so the other way to make a
magnetic field also go back to your you

4794
01:29:08,270 --> 01:29:08,280
magnetic field also go back to your you
 

4795
01:29:08,280 --> 01:29:10,550
magnetic field also go back to your you
know your your Elementary School physics

4796
01:29:10,550 --> 01:29:10,560
know your your Elementary School physics
 

4797
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:13,669
know your your Elementary School physics
uh or science class is that you take a a

4798
01:29:13,669 --> 01:29:13,679
uh or science class is that you take a a
 

4799
01:29:13,679 --> 01:29:15,950
uh or science class is that you take a a
nail and you wrap a copper wire around

4800
01:29:15,950 --> 01:29:15,960
nail and you wrap a copper wire around
 

4801
01:29:15,960 --> 01:29:17,450
nail and you wrap a copper wire around
it and connect it to a battery then it

4802
01:29:17,450 --> 01:29:17,460
it and connect it to a battery then it
 

4803
01:29:17,460 --> 01:29:19,430
it and connect it to a battery then it
can pick up iron filings this is an

4804
01:29:19,430 --> 01:29:19,440
can pick up iron filings this is an
 

4805
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:21,050
can pick up iron filings this is an
electromagnet

4806
01:29:21,050 --> 01:29:21,060
electromagnet
 

4807
01:29:21,060 --> 01:29:23,030
electromagnet
at its simplest what it is it's an

4808
01:29:23,030 --> 01:29:23,040
at its simplest what it is it's an
 

4809
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:24,709
at its simplest what it is it's an
electric current which is going in a

4810
01:29:24,709 --> 01:29:24,719
electric current which is going in a
 

4811
01:29:24,719 --> 01:29:27,410
electric current which is going in a
pattern around and around and around and

4812
01:29:27,410 --> 01:29:27,420
pattern around and around and around and
 

4813
01:29:27,420 --> 01:29:29,209
pattern around and around and around and
what this does is it produces a magnetic

4814
01:29:29,209 --> 01:29:29,219
what this does is it produces a magnetic
 

4815
01:29:29,219 --> 01:29:30,770
what this does is it produces a magnetic
field which goes through it by the laws

4816
01:29:30,770 --> 01:29:30,780
field which goes through it by the laws
 

4817
01:29:30,780 --> 01:29:32,510
field which goes through it by the laws
of electromagnetism

4818
01:29:32,510 --> 01:29:32,520
of electromagnetism
 

4819
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:34,729
of electromagnetism
so that's what an electro that's so

4820
01:29:34,729 --> 01:29:34,739
so that's what an electro that's so
 

4821
01:29:34,739 --> 01:29:36,890
so that's what an electro that's so
that's how we make the magnetic field in

4822
01:29:36,890 --> 01:29:36,900
that's how we make the magnetic field in
 

4823
01:29:36,900 --> 01:29:39,530
that's how we make the magnetic field in
these in in these configurations and the

4824
01:29:39,530 --> 01:29:39,540
these in in these configurations and the
 

4825
01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:42,649
these in in these configurations and the
key there is that you it's not limited

4826
01:29:42,649 --> 01:29:42,659
key there is that you it's not limited
 

4827
01:29:42,659 --> 01:29:44,930
key there is that you it's not limited
by the magnetic property of the material

4828
01:29:44,930 --> 01:29:44,940
by the magnetic property of the material
 

4829
01:29:44,940 --> 01:29:47,930
by the magnetic property of the material
the magnetic field uh amplitude is set

4830
01:29:47,930 --> 01:29:47,940
the magnetic field uh amplitude is set
 

4831
01:29:47,940 --> 01:29:50,209
the magnetic field uh amplitude is set
by the amount of the the geometry of

4832
01:29:50,209 --> 01:29:50,219
by the amount of the the geometry of
 

4833
01:29:50,219 --> 01:29:51,530
by the amount of the the geometry of
this thing and the amount of electric

4834
01:29:51,530 --> 01:29:51,540
this thing and the amount of electric
 

4835
01:29:51,540 --> 01:29:53,390
this thing and the amount of electric
current that you're putting through and

4836
01:29:53,390 --> 01:29:53,400
current that you're putting through and
 

4837
01:29:53,400 --> 01:29:55,129
current that you're putting through and
the more electric current that you put

4838
01:29:55,129 --> 01:29:55,139
the more electric current that you put

cult he was a stunt man and one of his

4854
01:30:15,470 --> 01:30:15,480
cult he was a stunt man and one of his
 

4855
01:30:15,480 --> 01:30:17,510
cult he was a stunt man and one of his
tricks was that he was he gets into a

4856
01:30:17,510 --> 01:30:17,520
tricks was that he was he gets into a
 

4857
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:19,010
tricks was that he was he gets into a
car and then one of those things in the

4858
01:30:19,010 --> 01:30:19,020
car and then one of those things in the
 

4859
01:30:19,020 --> 01:30:20,930
car and then one of those things in the
junkyard comes down you know and picks

4860
01:30:20,930 --> 01:30:20,940
junkyard comes down you know and picks
 

4861
01:30:20,940 --> 01:30:22,370
junkyard comes down you know and picks
up the car and then puts it into the

4862
01:30:22,370 --> 01:30:22,380
up the car and then puts it into the
 

4863
01:30:22,380 --> 01:30:24,590
up the car and then puts it into the
into the crusher this is his stunt which

4864
01:30:24,590 --> 01:30:24,600
into the crusher this is his stunt which
 

4865
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:26,450
into the crusher this is his stunt which
is pretty hilarious anyway

4866
01:30:26,450 --> 01:30:26,460
is pretty hilarious anyway
 

4867
01:30:26,460 --> 01:30:28,790
is pretty hilarious anyway
um but that thing that picks him up like

4868
01:30:28,790 --> 01:30:28,800
um but that thing that picks him up like
 

4869
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:30,530
um but that thing that picks him up like
how does that work that's actually not a

4870
01:30:30,530 --> 01:30:30,540
how does that work that's actually not a
 

4871
01:30:30,540 --> 01:30:31,910
how does that work that's actually not a
permanent magnet it's a it's an

4872
01:30:31,910 --> 01:30:31,920
permanent magnet it's a it's an
 

4873
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:34,610
permanent magnet it's a it's an
electromagnet and so you can turn by

4874
01:30:34,610 --> 01:30:34,620
electromagnet and so you can turn by
 

4875
01:30:34,620 --> 01:30:36,470
electromagnet and so you can turn by
turning off and on the power supply it

4876
01:30:36,470 --> 01:30:36,480
turning off and on the power supply it
 

4877
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:38,629
turning off and on the power supply it
turns off and on the magnetic field so

4878
01:30:38,629 --> 01:30:38,639
turns off and on the magnetic field so
 

4879
01:30:38,639 --> 01:30:40,310
turns off and on the magnetic field so
this means you can pick it up and then

4880
01:30:40,310 --> 01:30:40,320
this means you can pick it up and then
 

4881
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:42,229
this means you can pick it up and then
when you switch it off the magnetic

4882
01:30:42,229 --> 01:30:42,239
when you switch it off the magnetic
 

4883
01:30:42,239 --> 01:30:44,030
when you switch it off the magnetic
field goes away and the car drops okay

4884
01:30:44,030 --> 01:30:44,040
field goes away and the car drops okay
 

4885
01:30:44,040 --> 01:30:46,430
field goes away and the car drops okay
so that's that's what it looks like

4886
01:30:46,430 --> 01:30:46,440
so that's that's what it looks like
 

4887
01:30:46,440 --> 01:30:49,149
so that's that's what it looks like

you please tell me about this magnet
yeah sure oh it was it's fun yeah

4906
01:31:12,649 --> 01:31:12,659
yeah sure oh it was it's fun yeah
 

4907

yeah sure oh it was it's fun yeah
there's a lot to parse there so maybe uh

4908
01:31:16,189 --> 01:31:16,199
there's a lot to parse there so maybe uh
 

4909
01:31:16,199 --> 01:31:17,810
there's a lot to parse there so maybe uh
we so we already explained an

4910
01:31:17,810 --> 01:31:17,820
we so we already explained an
 

4911
01:31:17,820 --> 01:31:19,550
we so we already explained an
electromagnet which

4912
01:31:19,550 --> 01:31:19,560
electromagnet which
 

4913
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:22,250
electromagnet which
in general is what you do is you take

4914
01:31:22,250 --> 01:31:22,260
in general is what you do is you take
 

4915
01:31:22,260 --> 01:31:24,410
in general is what you do is you take
electric current and you force it to to

4916
01:31:24,410 --> 01:31:24,420
electric current and you force it to to
 

4917
01:31:24,420 --> 01:31:26,390
electric current and you force it to to
follow a pattern of some kind typically

4918
01:31:26,390 --> 01:31:26,400
follow a pattern of some kind typically
 

4919
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:28,610
follow a pattern of some kind typically
like a circular pattern around and

4920
01:31:28,610 --> 01:31:28,620
like a circular pattern around and
 

4921
01:31:28,620 --> 01:31:30,110
like a circular pattern around and
around and around around it goes the

4922
01:31:30,110 --> 01:31:30,120
around and around around it goes the
 

4923
01:31:30,120 --> 01:31:31,610
around and around around it goes the
more time the more current and the more

4924
01:31:31,610 --> 01:31:31,620
more time the more current and the more
 

4925
01:31:31,620 --> 01:31:33,050
more time the more current and the more
times it goes around the stronger the

4926
01:31:33,050 --> 01:31:33,060
times it goes around the stronger the
 

4927
01:31:33,060 --> 01:31:35,270
times it goes around the stronger the
magnetic field that you make okay

4928
01:31:35,270 --> 01:31:35,280
magnetic field that you make okay
 

4929
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:37,310
magnetic field that you make okay
and as I pointed out it's like really

4930
01:31:37,310 --> 01:31:37,320
and as I pointed out it's like really
 

4931
01:31:37,320 --> 01:31:39,110
and as I pointed out it's like really
important in magnetic confinement

4932
01:31:39,110 --> 01:31:39,120
important in magnetic confinement
 

4933
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:41,030
important in magnetic confinement
because it is the the force that's

4934
01:31:41,030 --> 01:31:41,040
because it is the the force that's
 

4935
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:42,410
because it is the the force that's
produced by that magnet in fact

4936
01:31:42,410 --> 01:31:42,420
produced by that magnet in fact
 

4937
01:31:42,420 --> 01:31:44,270
produced by that magnet in fact
technically it goes like the magnetic

4938
01:31:44,270 --> 01:31:44,280
technically it goes like the magnetic
 

4939
01:31:44,280 --> 01:31:46,970
technically it goes like the magnetic
field squared because it's it's a

4940
01:31:46,970 --> 01:31:46,980
field squared because it's it's a
 

4941
01:31:46,980 --> 01:31:48,649
field squared because it's it's a
pressure which is actually being exerted

4942
01:31:48,649 --> 01:31:48,659
pressure which is actually being exerted
 

4943
01:31:48,659 --> 01:31:52,850
pressure which is actually being exerted
on the plasma to keep it contained uh

4944
01:31:52,850 --> 01:31:52,860
on the plasma to keep it contained uh
 

4945
01:31:52,860 --> 01:31:54,410
on the plasma to keep it contained uh
just just so we know for a magnetic

4946
01:31:54,410 --> 01:31:54,420
just just so we know for a magnetic
 

4947
01:31:54,420 --> 01:31:56,450
just just so we know for a magnetic
confinement what is usually the geometry

4948
01:31:56,450 --> 01:31:56,460
confinement what is usually the geometry
 

4949
01:31:56,460 --> 01:31:58,490
confinement what is usually the geometry
of the magnet what are we the geometry

4950
01:31:58,490 --> 01:31:58,500
of the magnet what are we the geometry
 

4951
01:31:58,500 --> 01:32:01,189
of the magnet what are we the geometry
yeah so the geometry is typically that

4952
01:32:01,189 --> 01:32:01,199
yeah so the geometry is typically that
 

4953
01:32:01,199 --> 01:32:04,129
yeah so the geometry is typically that
typically is what you do is you want to

4954
01:32:04,129 --> 01:32:04,139
typically is what you do is you want to
 

4955
01:32:04,139 --> 01:32:06,050
typically is what you do is you want to
produce a magnetic field that Loops back

4956
01:32:06,050 --> 01:32:06,060
produce a magnetic field that Loops back
 

4957
01:32:06,060 --> 01:32:09,310
produce a magnetic field that Loops back
on itself and the reason for this was

4958
01:32:09,310 --> 01:32:09,320
on itself and the reason for this was
 

4959
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:11,570
on itself and the reason for this was
goes down to the nature of the force

4960
01:32:11,570 --> 01:32:11,580
goes down to the nature of the force
 

4961
01:32:11,580 --> 01:32:13,669
goes down to the nature of the force
that I described

4962
01:32:13,669 --> 01:32:13,679
that I described
 

4963
01:32:13,679 --> 01:32:16,310
that I described
which is that there's no there's no

4964
01:32:16,310 --> 01:32:16,320
which is that there's no there's no
 

4965
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:18,470
which is that there's no there's no
containment or Force along the direction

4966
01:32:18,470 --> 01:32:18,480
containment or Force along the direction
 

4967
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:20,689
containment or Force along the direction
of the magnetic field so here's a

4968
01:32:20,689 --> 01:32:20,699
of the magnetic field so here's a
 

4969
01:32:20,699 --> 01:32:22,750
of the magnetic field so here's a
magnetic field in fact what what it's

4970
01:32:22,750 --> 01:32:22,760
magnetic field in fact what what it's
 

4971
01:32:22,760 --> 01:32:25,370
magnetic field in fact what what it's
more technically or more graphically

4972
01:32:25,370 --> 01:32:25,380
more technically or more graphically
 

4973
01:32:25,380 --> 01:32:27,410
more technically or more graphically
what it's doing is that when the when

4974
01:32:27,410 --> 01:32:27,420
what it's doing is that when the when
 

4975
01:32:27,420 --> 01:32:29,450
what it's doing is that when the when
the plasma is here's plasma particles

4976
01:32:29,450 --> 01:32:29,460
the plasma is here's plasma particles
 

4977
01:32:29,460 --> 01:32:31,729
the plasma is here's plasma particles
here there's a magnetic field what it

4978
01:32:31,729 --> 01:32:31,739
here there's a magnetic field what it
 

4979
01:32:31,739 --> 01:32:33,830
here there's a magnetic field what it
does is it forces all those because of

4980
01:32:33,830 --> 01:32:33,840
does is it forces all those because of
 

4981
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:36,950
does is it forces all those because of
this this Lorenz force it makes all of

4982
01:32:36,950 --> 01:32:36,960
this this Lorenz force it makes all of
 

4983
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:39,110
this this Lorenz force it makes all of
those charged particles execute circular

4984
01:32:39,110 --> 01:32:39,120
those charged particles execute circular
 

4985
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:41,810
those charged particles execute circular
orbits around the magnetic field and

4986
01:32:41,810 --> 01:32:41,820
orbits around the magnetic field and
 

4987
01:32:41,820 --> 01:32:43,970
orbits around the magnetic field and
they go around like this but they stream

4988
01:32:43,970 --> 01:32:43,980
they go around like this but they stream
 

4989
01:32:43,980 --> 01:32:47,090
they go around like this but they stream
freely along the magnetic field line so

4990
01:32:47,090 --> 01:32:47,100
freely along the magnetic field line so
 

4991
01:32:47,100 --> 01:32:48,709
freely along the magnetic field line so
this is why the nature of the

4992
01:32:48,709 --> 01:32:48,719
this is why the nature of the
 

4993
01:32:48,719 --> 01:32:50,450
this is why the nature of the
containment is that if you can get that

4994
01:32:50,450 --> 01:32:50,460
containment is that if you can get that
 

4995
01:32:50,460 --> 01:32:52,370
containment is that if you can get that
Circle smaller and smaller it stays

4996
01:32:52,370 --> 01:32:52,380
Circle smaller and smaller it stays
 

4997
01:32:52,380 --> 01:32:55,370
Circle smaller and smaller it stays
further away from Earth temperature

4998
01:32:55,370 --> 01:32:55,380
further away from Earth temperature
 

4999
01:32:55,380 --> 01:32:56,990
further away from Earth temperature
materials that's why the confinement

5000
01:32:56,990 --> 01:32:57,000
materials that's why the confinement
 

5001
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,209
materials that's why the confinement
gets better but the problem is is that

5002
01:32:59,209 --> 01:32:59,219
gets better but the problem is is that
 

5003
01:32:59,219 --> 01:33:01,010
gets better but the problem is is that
because it free streams along so we just

5004
01:33:01,010 --> 01:33:01,020
because it free streams along so we just
 

5005
01:33:01,020 --> 01:33:03,649
because it free streams along so we just
have a long straight magnetic field okay

5006
01:33:03,649 --> 01:33:03,659
have a long straight magnetic field okay
 

5007
01:33:03,659 --> 01:33:05,510
have a long straight magnetic field okay
it'll just keep leaking out the ends

5008
01:33:05,510 --> 01:33:05,520
it'll just keep leaking out the ends
 

5009
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:07,669
it'll just keep leaking out the ends
like really fast so you get rid of the

5010
01:33:07,669 --> 01:33:07,679
like really fast so you get rid of the
 

5011
01:33:07,679 --> 01:33:09,709
like really fast so you get rid of the
ends so you basically Loop it back

5012
01:33:09,709 --> 01:33:09,719
ends so you basically Loop it back
 

5013
01:33:09,719 --> 01:33:11,870
ends so you basically Loop it back
around so what these look like are

5014
01:33:11,870 --> 01:33:11,880
around so what these look like are
 

5015
01:33:11,880 --> 01:33:14,390
around so what these look like are
typically donut shaped or more

5016
01:33:14,390 --> 01:33:14,400
typically donut shaped or more
 

5017
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:16,669
typically donut shaped or more
technically toroidal shape but donut

5018
01:33:16,669 --> 01:33:16,679
technically toroidal shape but donut
 

5019
01:33:16,679 --> 01:33:19,729
technically toroidal shape but donut
shaped um things where this collection

5020
01:33:19,729 --> 01:33:19,739
shaped um things where this collection
 

5021
01:33:19,739 --> 01:33:21,830
shaped um things where this collection
of magnetic fields Loops back on itself

5022
01:33:21,830 --> 01:33:21,840
of magnetic fields Loops back on itself
 

5023
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:23,990
of magnetic fields Loops back on itself
and it also for reasons which are more

5024
01:33:23,990 --> 01:33:24,000
and it also for reasons which are more
 

5025
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,149
and it also for reasons which are more
complicated to explain basically it also

5026
01:33:26,149 --> 01:33:26,159
complicated to explain basically it also
 

5027
01:33:26,159 --> 01:33:29,090
complicated to explain basically it also
twists it also twists slowly around in

5028
01:33:29,090 --> 01:33:29,100
twists it also twists slowly around in
 

5029
01:33:29,100 --> 01:33:31,070
twists it also twists slowly around in
this direction as well too so that's

5030
01:33:31,070 --> 01:33:31,080
this direction as well too so that's
 

5031
01:33:31,080 --> 01:33:32,510
this direction as well too so that's
what it looks like that's what the

5032
01:33:32,510 --> 01:33:32,520
what it looks like that's what the
 

5033
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:34,189
what it looks like that's what the
plasma looks like because that's what

5034
01:33:34,189 --> 01:33:34,199
plasma looks like because that's what
 

5035
01:33:34,199 --> 01:33:36,229
plasma looks like because that's what
the fuel looks like so then this means

5036
01:33:36,229 --> 01:33:36,239
the fuel looks like so then this means
 

5037
01:33:36,239 --> 01:33:39,709
the fuel looks like so then this means
is that the um the electromagnets are

5038
01:33:39,709 --> 01:33:39,719
is that the um the electromagnets are
 

5039
01:33:39,719 --> 01:33:41,270
is that the um the electromagnets are
configured in such a way that it

5040
01:33:41,270 --> 01:33:41,280
configured in such a way that it
 

5041
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:43,669
configured in such a way that it
produces the desired magnetic fields

5042
01:33:43,669 --> 01:33:43,679
produces the desired magnetic fields
 

5043
01:33:43,679 --> 01:33:45,470
produces the desired magnetic fields
around this so they precise does this

5044
01:33:45,470 --> 01:33:45,480
around this so they precise does this
 

5045
01:33:45,480 --> 01:33:46,850
around this so they precise does this
have to be you were probably listening

5046
01:33:46,850 --> 01:33:46,860
have to be you were probably listening
 

5047
01:33:46,860 --> 01:33:48,410
have to be you were probably listening
to our conversation with some of my

5048
01:33:48,410 --> 01:33:48,420
to our conversation with some of my
 

5049
01:33:48,420 --> 01:33:50,270
to our conversation with some of my
colleagues yesterday so it's actually

5050
01:33:50,270 --> 01:33:50,280
colleagues yesterday so it's actually
 

5051
01:33:50,280 --> 01:33:52,970
colleagues yesterday so it's actually
it's it depends on the configuration uh

5052
01:33:52,970 --> 01:33:52,980
it's it depends on the configuration uh
 

5053
01:33:52,980 --> 01:33:54,350
it's it depends on the configuration uh
about how you're doing it the

5054
01:33:54,350 --> 01:33:54,360
about how you're doing it the
 

5055
01:33:54,360 --> 01:33:55,669
about how you're doing it the
configuration of the plasma the

5056
01:33:55,669 --> 01:33:55,679
configuration of the plasma the
 

5057
01:33:55,679 --> 01:33:57,290
configuration of the plasma the
configuration of the electromagnets and

5058
01:33:57,290 --> 01:33:57,300
configuration of the electromagnets and
 

5059
01:33:57,300 --> 01:33:58,790
configuration of the electromagnets and
about how you're achieving this this

5060
01:33:58,790 --> 01:33:58,800
about how you're achieving this this
 

5061
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:00,410
about how you're achieving this this
requirement

5062
01:34:00,410 --> 01:34:00,420
requirement
 

5063
01:34:00,420 --> 01:34:03,229
requirement
um it it's it's fairly precise but it

5064
01:34:03,229 --> 01:34:03,239
um it it's it's fairly precise but it
 

5065
01:34:03,239 --> 01:34:05,570
um it it's it's fairly precise but it
doesn't have to be in particularly in

5066
01:34:05,570 --> 01:34:05,580
doesn't have to be in particularly in
 

5067
01:34:05,580 --> 01:34:07,129
doesn't have to be in particularly in
something like a Tokamak what we do is

5068
01:34:07,129 --> 01:34:07,139
something like a Tokamak what we do is
 

5069
01:34:07,139 --> 01:34:09,410
something like a Tokamak what we do is
we produce planar coils that just mean

5070
01:34:09,410 --> 01:34:09,420
we produce planar coils that just mean
 

5071
01:34:09,420 --> 01:34:12,709
we produce planar coils that just mean
they're flat and we situate them so if

5072
01:34:12,709 --> 01:34:12,719
they're flat and we situate them so if
 

5073
01:34:12,719 --> 01:34:15,950
they're flat and we situate them so if
you think of a circle like this what

5074
01:34:15,950 --> 01:34:15,960
you think of a circle like this what
 

5075
01:34:15,960 --> 01:34:17,270
you think of a circle like this what
does it produce if you put current

5076
01:34:17,270 --> 01:34:17,280
does it produce if you put current
 

5077
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:19,129
does it produce if you put current
through it it produces a magnetic field

5078
01:34:19,129 --> 01:34:19,139
through it it produces a magnetic field
 

5079
01:34:19,139 --> 01:34:21,649
through it it produces a magnetic field
which goes through the circle like this

5080
01:34:21,649 --> 01:34:21,659
which goes through the circle like this
 

5081
01:34:21,659 --> 01:34:24,410
which goes through the circle like this
so if you align many of them like this

5082
01:34:24,410 --> 01:34:24,420
so if you align many of them like this
 

5083
01:34:24,420 --> 01:34:26,270
so if you align many of them like this
this this this this there's things

5084
01:34:26,270 --> 01:34:26,280
this this this this there's things
 

5085
01:34:26,280 --> 01:34:28,370
this this this this there's things
online you can go see the picture to to

5086
01:34:28,370 --> 01:34:28,380
online you can go see the picture to to
 

5087
01:34:28,380 --> 01:34:30,709
online you can go see the picture to to
you keep arranging these around in a

5088
01:34:30,709 --> 01:34:30,719
you keep arranging these around in a
 

5089
01:34:30,719 --> 01:34:32,870
you keep arranging these around in a
circle itself this forces the magnetic

5090
01:34:32,870 --> 01:34:32,880
circle itself this forces the magnetic
 

5091
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:34,010
circle itself this forces the magnetic
field lines to basically just keep

5092
01:34:34,010 --> 01:34:34,020
field lines to basically just keep
 

5093
01:34:34,020 --> 01:34:36,110
field lines to basically just keep
executing around like this so you tend

5094
01:34:36,110 --> 01:34:36,120
executing around like this so you tend
 

5095
01:34:36,120 --> 01:34:38,390
executing around like this so you tend
to align that one tends to re well it

5096
01:34:38,390 --> 01:34:38,400
to align that one tends to re well it
 

5097
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:41,570
to align that one tends to re well it
requires good confine or good alignment

5098
01:34:41,570 --> 01:34:41,580
requires good confine or good alignment
 

5099
01:34:41,580 --> 01:34:43,370
requires good confine or good alignment
it's not like in insane alignment

5100
01:34:43,370 --> 01:34:43,380
it's not like in insane alignment
 

5101
01:34:43,380 --> 01:34:45,110
it's not like in insane alignment
because you're you're actually

5102
01:34:45,110 --> 01:34:45,120
because you're you're actually
 

5103
01:34:45,120 --> 01:34:46,850
because you're you're actually
exploiting the symmetry of the situation

5104
01:34:46,850 --> 01:34:46,860
exploiting the symmetry of the situation
 

5105
01:34:46,860 --> 01:34:49,189
exploiting the symmetry of the situation
to to help it there's another kind of

01:34:49,189 --> 01:34:49,199
to to help it there's another kind of
 

5107
01:34:49,199 --> 01:34:51,229
to to help it there's another kind of
configuration of magnetic of this kind

5108
01:34:51,229 --> 01:34:51,239
configuration of magnetic of this kind
 

5109
01:34:51,239 --> 01:34:52,490
configuration of magnetic of this kind
of magnetic confinement called a

01:34:52,490 --> 01:34:52,500
of magnetic confinement called a
 

5111
01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:55,129
of magnetic confinement called a
stellarator which is we have these names

5112
01:34:55,129 --> 01:34:55,139
stellarator which is we have these names
 

5113
01:34:55,139 --> 01:34:57,229
stellarator which is we have these names
from for historic reasons which is

5114
01:34:57,229 --> 01:34:57,239
from for historic reasons which is
 

5115
01:34:57,239 --> 01:34:58,550
from for historic reasons which is
different than a Taco Mac it's different

01:34:58,560 --> 01:34:59,990
different than a Taco Mac it's different
than a token that actually works on the

the end it produces a plasma which Loops

5122
01:35:04,010 --> 01:35:04,020
the end it produces a plasma which Loops
 

5123
01:35:04,020 --> 01:35:06,050
the end it produces a plasma which Loops
in magnetic fields which loop back on

5124
01:35:06,050 --> 01:35:06,060
in magnetic fields which loop back on
 

5125
01:35:06,060 --> 01:35:08,750
in magnetic fields which loop back on
themselves as well but in that in that

01:35:08,750 --> 01:35:08,760
themselves as well but in that in that
 

5127
01:35:08,760 --> 01:35:11,629

case the totality basically the totality

5128
01:35:11,629 --> 01:35:11,639
case the totality basically the totality
 

5129
01:35:11,639 --> 01:35:13,070
case the totality basically the totality
of the confining magnetic field is

5130
01:35:13,070 --> 01:35:13,080
of the confining magnetic field is
 

5131
01:35:13,080 --> 01:35:15,649
of the confining magnetic field is
produced by external three-dimensional

5132
01:35:15,649 --> 01:35:15,659
produced by external three-dimensional
 

5133
01:35:15,659 --> 01:35:18,229
produced by external three-dimensional
magnets so they're Twisted

5134
01:35:18,229 --> 01:35:18,239
magnets so they're Twisted
 

5135
01:35:18,239 --> 01:35:20,209
magnets so they're Twisted
um and it turns out the Precision of

5136
01:35:20,209 --> 01:35:20,219
um and it turns out the Precision of
 

5137
01:35:20,219 --> 01:35:23,870
um and it turns out the Precision of
those is is more stringent yeah so are

5138
01:35:23,870 --> 01:35:23,880
those is is more stringent yeah so are
 

5139
01:35:23,880 --> 01:35:26,149
those is is more stringent yeah so are
taco Mac's by far more popular for

01:35:39,470 --> 01:35:39,480
um and thinking about how it would be
 

5153
01:35:39,480 --> 01:35:42,050
um and thinking about how it would be
applied in a Fusion Energy System in the

5154
01:35:42,050 --> 01:35:42,060
applied in a Fusion Energy System in the
 

5155
01:35:42,060 --> 01:35:43,729
applied in a Fusion Energy System in the
history of this was that many in fact

5156
01:35:43,729 --> 01:35:43,739
history of this was that many in fact
 

5157
01:35:43,739 --> 01:35:45,350
history of this was that many in fact
you asked about if we go back to the

5158
01:35:45,350 --> 01:35:45,360
you asked about if we go back to the
 

5159
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:46,729
you asked about if we go back to the
history of the Plato science infusion

5160
01:35:46,729 --> 01:35:46,739
history of the Plato science infusion
 

5161
01:35:46,739 --> 01:35:49,010
history of the Plato science infusion
center the history of fusion is that

5162
01:35:49,010 --> 01:35:49,020
center the history of fusion is that
 

5163
01:35:49,020 --> 01:35:50,410
center the history of fusion is that
people

5164
01:35:50,410 --> 01:35:50,420
people
 

5165
01:35:50,420 --> 01:35:52,550
people
scientists had started to work on this

5166
01:35:52,550 --> 01:35:52,560
scientists had started to work on this
 

5167
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:55,010
scientists had started to work on this
in the 1950s it was all hush-hush and

5168
01:35:55,010 --> 01:35:55,020
in the 1950s it was all hush-hush and
 

5169
01:35:55,020 --> 01:35:56,570
in the 1950s it was all hush-hush and
you know Cold War and all that kind of

5170
01:35:56,570 --> 01:35:56,580
you know Cold War and all that kind of
 

5171
01:35:56,580 --> 01:35:58,729
you know Cold War and all that kind of
stuff and and it's like they realized

5172
01:35:58,729 --> 01:35:58,739
stuff and and it's like they realized
 

5173
01:35:58,739 --> 01:36:00,470
stuff and and it's like they realized
holy cow they're like this is like

5174
01:36:00,470 --> 01:36:00,480
holy cow they're like this is like
 

5175
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:02,149
holy cow they're like this is like
really hard like we actually don't

5176
01:36:02,149 --> 01:36:02,159
really hard like we actually don't
 

5177
01:36:02,159 --> 01:36:03,830
really hard like we actually don't
really know like what we're doing in

5178
01:36:03,830 --> 01:36:03,840
really know like what we're doing in
 

5179
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:05,870
really know like what we're doing in
this because everything was at low

5180
01:36:05,870 --> 01:36:05,880
this because everything was at low
 

5181
01:36:05,880 --> 01:36:07,010
this because everything was at low
temperatures they couldn't get

5182
01:36:07,010 --> 01:36:07,020
temperatures they couldn't get
 

5183
01:36:07,020 --> 01:36:09,229
temperatures they couldn't get
confinement it was interesting and then

5184
01:36:09,229 --> 01:36:09,239
confinement it was interesting and then
 

5185
01:36:09,239 --> 01:36:11,750
confinement it was interesting and then
the the they Declassified it and this is

5186
01:36:11,750 --> 01:36:11,760
the the they Declassified it and this is
 

5187
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:14,510
the the they Declassified it and this is
one of the few places that the the west

5188
01:36:14,510 --> 01:36:14,520
one of the few places that the the west
 

5189
01:36:14,520 --> 01:36:16,250
one of the few places that the the west
and the Soviet Union actually

5190
01:36:16,250 --> 01:36:16,260
and the Soviet Union actually
 

5191
01:36:16,260 --> 01:36:18,169
and the Soviet Union actually
collaborated on was a science even

5192
01:36:18,169 --> 01:36:18,179
collaborated on was a science even
 

5193
01:36:18,179 --> 01:36:19,430
collaborated on was a science even
during the Cold War even during the

5194
01:36:19,430 --> 01:36:19,440
during the Cold War even during the
 

5195
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:21,530
during the Cold War even during the
middle of the Cold War it was really and

5196
01:36:21,530 --> 01:36:21,540
middle of the Cold War it was really and
 

5197
01:36:21,540 --> 01:36:23,510
middle of the Cold War it was really and
this actually perpetuates all the way

5198
01:36:23,510 --> 01:36:23,520
this actually perpetuates all the way
 

5199
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:26,270
this actually perpetuates all the way
till now for we we can talk about the

5200
01:36:26,270 --> 01:36:26,280
till now for we we can talk about the
 

5201
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:28,310
till now for we we can talk about the
the project that that is sort of

5202
01:36:28,310 --> 01:36:28,320
the project that that is sort of
 

5203
01:36:28,320 --> 01:36:30,410
the project that that is sort of
captured in now

5204
01:36:30,410 --> 01:36:30,420
captured in now
 

5205
01:36:30,420 --> 01:36:31,129
captured in now
um

5206
01:36:31,129 --> 01:36:31,139
um
 

5207
01:36:31,139 --> 01:36:33,890
um
uh but and and the reason they

5208
01:36:33,890 --> 01:36:33,900
uh but and and the reason they
 

5209
01:36:33,900 --> 01:36:35,629
uh but and and the reason they
Declassified it is because like

5210
01:36:35,629 --> 01:36:35,639
Declassified it is because like
 

5211
01:36:35,639 --> 01:36:38,090
Declassified it is because like
everything like kind of like sucked

5212
01:36:38,090 --> 01:36:38,100
everything like kind of like sucked
 

5213
01:36:38,100 --> 01:36:40,189
everything like kind of like sucked
basically you know about trying to make

5214
01:36:40,189 --> 01:36:40,199
basically you know about trying to make
 

5215
01:36:40,199 --> 01:36:41,570
basically you know about trying to make
this confinement in high temperature

5216
01:36:41,570 --> 01:36:41,580
this confinement in high temperature
 

5217
01:36:41,580 --> 01:36:45,350
this confinement in high temperature
plasma and then the Russians then the

5218
01:36:45,350 --> 01:36:45,360
plasma and then the Russians then the
 

5219
01:36:45,360 --> 01:36:47,149
plasma and then the Russians then the
Soviets right came along with this

5220
01:36:47,149 --> 01:36:47,159
Soviets right came along with this
 

5221
01:36:47,159 --> 01:36:49,370
Soviets right came along with this
device called the Tokamak which is a

5222
01:36:49,370 --> 01:36:49,380
device called the Tokamak which is a
 

5223
01:36:49,380 --> 01:36:52,010
device called the Tokamak which is a
Russian acronym which basically means

5224
01:36:52,010 --> 01:36:52,020
Russian acronym which basically means
 

5225
01:36:52,020 --> 01:36:54,649
Russian acronym which basically means
uh magnetic coils arranged in the shape

5226
01:36:54,649 --> 01:36:54,659
uh magnetic coils arranged in the shape
 

5227
01:36:54,659 --> 01:36:57,169
uh magnetic coils arranged in the shape
of a donut and

5228
01:36:57,169 --> 01:36:57,179
of a donut and
 

5229
01:36:57,179 --> 01:37:01,250
of a donut and
and um they said holy holy cow like

5230
01:37:01,250 --> 01:37:01,260
and um they said holy holy cow like
 

5231
01:37:01,260 --> 01:37:03,830
and um they said holy holy cow like
everyone was stuck at like a meager like

5232
01:37:03,830 --> 01:37:03,840
everyone was stuck at like a meager like
 

5233
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:06,350
everyone was stuck at like a meager like
half a million degrees or half a million

5234
01:37:06,350 --> 01:37:06,360
half a million degrees or half a million
 

5235
01:37:06,360 --> 01:37:08,390
half a million degrees or half a million
degrees which is like in Fusion terms of

5236
01:37:08,390 --> 01:37:08,400
degrees which is like in Fusion terms of
 

5237
01:37:08,400 --> 01:37:10,010
degrees which is like in Fusion terms of
zero basically

5238
01:37:10,010 --> 01:37:10,020
zero basically
 

5239
01:37:10,020 --> 01:37:11,570
zero basically
um and then they come along they say oh

5240
01:37:11,570 --> 01:37:11,580
um and then they come along they say oh
 

5241
01:37:11,580 --> 01:37:13,490
um and then they come along they say oh
we've actually achieved a temperature 20

5242
01:37:13,490 --> 01:37:13,500
we've actually achieved a temperature 20
 

5243
01:37:13,500 --> 01:37:15,649
we've actually achieved a temperature 20
times higher than everybody else and

5244
01:37:15,649 --> 01:37:15,659
times higher than everybody else and
 

5245
01:37:15,659 --> 01:37:16,910
times higher than everybody else and
it's actually started to make fusion

5246
01:37:16,910 --> 01:37:16,920
it's actually started to make fusion
 

5247
01:37:16,920 --> 01:37:19,370
it's actually started to make fusion
reactions and everyone just go oh you

5248
01:37:19,370 --> 01:37:19,380
reactions and everyone just go oh you
 

5249
01:37:19,380 --> 01:37:21,110
reactions and everyone just go oh you
know no way it's just hype from this

5250
01:37:21,110 --> 01:37:21,120
know no way it's just hype from this
 

5251
01:37:21,120 --> 01:37:22,550
know no way it's just hype from this
it's like there's no way because we

5252
01:37:22,550 --> 01:37:22,560
it's like there's no way because we
 

5253
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:24,530
it's like there's no way because we
failed at this

5254
01:37:24,530 --> 01:37:24,540
failed at this
 

5255
01:37:24,540 --> 01:37:26,450
failed at this
um it's a great story in the history of

5256
01:37:26,450 --> 01:37:26,460
um it's a great story in the history of
 

5257
01:37:26,460 --> 01:37:28,430
um it's a great story in the history of
fusion is that then but this insisters

5258
01:37:28,430 --> 01:37:28,440
fusion is that then but this insisters
 

5259
01:37:28,440 --> 01:37:29,930
fusion is that then but this insisters
said no look you can see this from our

5260
01:37:29,930 --> 01:37:29,940
said no look you can see this from our
 

5261
01:37:29,940 --> 01:37:31,669
said no look you can see this from our
data it's like this thing is really hot

5262
01:37:31,669 --> 01:37:31,679
data it's like this thing is really hot
 

5263
01:37:31,679 --> 01:37:33,709
data it's like this thing is really hot
and it seems to be working this is you

5264
01:37:33,709 --> 01:37:33,719
and it seems to be working this is you
 

5265
01:37:33,719 --> 01:37:38,030
and it seems to be working this is you
know late 1960s and there was a uh there

5266
01:37:38,030 --> 01:37:38,040
know late 1960s and there was a uh there
 

5267
01:37:38,040 --> 01:37:39,169
know late 1960s and there was a uh there
was a team that went from the United

5268
01:37:39,169 --> 01:37:39,179
was a team that went from the United
 

5269
01:37:39,179 --> 01:37:41,750
was a team that went from the United
Kingdom's Fusion development lab and

5270
01:37:41,750 --> 01:37:41,760
Kingdom's Fusion development lab and
 

5271
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:44,629
Kingdom's Fusion development lab and
they brought this very fancy amazing new

5272
01:37:44,629 --> 01:37:44,639
they brought this very fancy amazing new
 

5273
01:37:44,639 --> 01:37:47,590
they brought this very fancy amazing new
technology called a laser

5274
01:37:47,590 --> 01:37:47,600
technology called a laser
 

5275
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:50,330
technology called a laser
and they use this laser and they shot

5276
01:37:50,330 --> 01:37:50,340
and they use this laser and they shot
 

5277
01:37:50,340 --> 01:37:52,490
and they use this laser and they shot
the laser beam like through the plasma

5278
01:37:52,490 --> 01:37:52,500
the laser beam like through the plasma
 

5279
01:37:52,500 --> 01:37:54,290
the laser beam like through the plasma
and by looking at the scattered light

5280
01:37:54,290 --> 01:37:54,300
and by looking at the scattered light
 

5281
01:37:54,300 --> 01:37:56,270
and by looking at the scattered light
that came from the they go that

5282
01:37:56,270 --> 01:37:56,280
that came from the they go that
 

5283
01:37:56,280 --> 01:37:58,550
that came from the they go that
basically the scattered light gets more

5284
01:37:58,550 --> 01:37:58,560
basically the scattered light gets more
 

5285
01:37:58,560 --> 01:38:00,709
basically the scattered light gets more
broadened in its Spectrum if it gets

5286
01:38:00,709 --> 01:38:00,719
broadened in its Spectrum if it gets
 

5287
01:38:00,719 --> 01:38:02,930
broadened in its Spectrum if it gets
hotter so you could you could exactly

5288
01:38:02,930 --> 01:38:02,940
hotter so you could you could exactly
 

5289
01:38:02,940 --> 01:38:04,250
hotter so you could you could exactly
tell the temperature of this and even

5290
01:38:04,250 --> 01:38:04,260
tell the temperature of this and even
 

5291
01:38:04,260 --> 01:38:05,390
tell the temperature of this and even
though you're not physically touching

5292
01:38:05,390 --> 01:38:05,400
though you're not physically touching
 

5293
01:38:05,400 --> 01:38:07,189
though you're not physically touching
the plasma it's like holy cow you're

5294
01:38:07,189 --> 01:38:07,199
the plasma it's like holy cow you're
 

5295
01:38:07,199 --> 01:38:09,890
the plasma it's like holy cow you're
right it is like it is 10 million

5296
01:38:09,890 --> 01:38:09,900
right it is like it is 10 million
 

5297
01:38:09,900 --> 01:38:12,970
right it is like it is 10 million
degrees and so this was one of those

5298
01:38:12,970 --> 01:38:12,980
degrees and so this was one of those
 

5299
01:38:12,980 --> 01:38:16,310
degrees and so this was one of those
explosions of like everyone in the world

5300
01:38:16,310 --> 01:38:16,320
explosions of like everyone in the world
 

5301
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:18,290
explosions of like everyone in the world
then wanted to build a token back

5302
01:38:18,290 --> 01:38:18,300
then wanted to build a token back
 

5303
01:38:18,300 --> 01:38:21,709
then wanted to build a token back
because it was clearly like wow this is

5304
01:38:21,709 --> 01:38:21,719
because it was clearly like wow this is
 

5305
01:38:21,719 --> 01:38:23,270
because it was clearly like wow this is
like so far ahead of everything else

5306
01:38:23,270 --> 01:38:23,280
like so far ahead of everything else
 

5307
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:25,490
like so far ahead of everything else
that we tried before

5308
01:38:25,490 --> 01:38:25,500
that we tried before
 

5309
01:38:25,500 --> 01:38:26,750
that we tried before
um so that actually has a part of the

5310
01:38:26,750 --> 01:38:26,760
um so that actually has a part of the
 

5311
01:38:26,760 --> 01:38:28,490
um so that actually has a part of the
the story to MIT in the Plato science

5312
01:38:28,490 --> 01:38:28,500
the story to MIT in the Plato science
 

5313
01:38:28,500 --> 01:38:30,610
the story to MIT in the Plato science
infusion center was

5314
01:38:30,610 --> 01:38:30,620
infusion center was
 

5315
01:38:30,620 --> 01:38:33,530
infusion center was
why is there a strong Fusion in a major

5316
01:38:33,530 --> 01:38:33,540
why is there a strong Fusion in a major
 

5317
01:38:33,540 --> 01:38:36,890
why is there a strong Fusion in a major
Fusion program at MIT it was because we

5318
01:38:36,890 --> 01:38:36,900
Fusion program at MIT it was because we
 

5319
01:38:36,900 --> 01:38:38,810
Fusion program at MIT it was because we
were host to the Francis bitter magnet

5320
01:38:38,810 --> 01:38:38,820
were host to the Francis bitter magnet
 

5321
01:38:38,820 --> 01:38:40,310
were host to the Francis bitter magnet
laboratory which is also the National

5322
01:38:40,310 --> 01:38:40,320
laboratory which is also the National
 

5323
01:38:40,320 --> 01:38:42,830
laboratory which is also the National
High field magnet laboratory well you

5324
01:38:42,830 --> 01:38:42,840
High field magnet laboratory well you
 

5325
01:38:42,840 --> 01:38:44,570
High field magnet laboratory well you
can see where this goes right from this

5326
01:38:44,570 --> 01:38:44,580
can see where this goes right from this
 

5327
01:38:44,580 --> 01:38:45,890
can see where this goes right from this
you know we're kind of telling the

5328
01:38:45,890 --> 01:38:45,900
you know we're kind of telling the
 

5329
01:38:45,900 --> 01:38:48,229
you know we're kind of telling the
stories backwards almost but you know

5330
01:38:48,229 --> 01:38:48,239
stories backwards almost but you know
 

5331
01:38:48,239 --> 01:38:52,550
stories backwards almost but you know
the the the Advent of a Toca Mac along

5332
01:38:52,550 --> 01:38:52,560
the the the Advent of a Toca Mac along
 

5333
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:55,070
the the the Advent of a Toca Mac along
with the fact that you could makes very

5334
01:38:55,070 --> 01:38:55,080
with the fact that you could makes very
 

5335
01:38:55,080 --> 01:38:56,510
with the fact that you could makes very
strong magnetic fields with the

5336
01:38:56,510 --> 01:38:56,520
strong magnetic fields with the
 

5337
01:38:56,520 --> 01:38:57,950
strong magnetic fields with the
technology that had been developed at

5338
01:38:57,950 --> 01:38:57,960
technology that had been developed at
 

5339
01:38:57,960 --> 01:39:00,229
technology that had been developed at
that laboratory that was the origins of

5340
01:39:00,229 --> 01:39:00,239
that laboratory that was the origins of
 

5341
01:39:00,239 --> 01:39:02,570
that laboratory that was the origins of
sort of pushing together the physics of

5342
01:39:02,570 --> 01:39:02,580
sort of pushing together the physics of
 

5343
01:39:02,580 --> 01:39:04,850
sort of pushing together the physics of
the of the plasma containment and the

5344
01:39:04,850 --> 01:39:04,860
the of the plasma containment and the
 

5345
01:39:04,860 --> 01:39:07,310
the of the plasma containment and the
magnet technology and put them together

5346
01:39:07,310 --> 01:39:07,320
magnet technology and put them together
 

5347
01:39:07,320 --> 01:39:09,350
magnet technology and put them together
in a way that I would say is you know a

5348
01:39:09,350 --> 01:39:09,360
in a way that I would say is you know a
 

5349
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:11,870
in a way that I would say is you know a
very typical MIT success story right we

5350
01:39:11,870 --> 01:39:11,880
very typical MIT success story right we
 

5351
01:39:11,880 --> 01:39:14,270
very typical MIT success story right we
don't do just just pure science or pure

5352
01:39:14,270 --> 01:39:14,280
don't do just just pure science or pure
 

5353
01:39:14,280 --> 01:39:15,649
don't do just just pure science or pure
technology we sort of set up this

5354
01:39:15,649 --> 01:39:15,659
technology we sort of set up this
 

5355
01:39:15,659 --> 01:39:17,149
technology we sort of set up this
intersection between them and there were

5356
01:39:17,149 --> 01:39:17,159
intersection between them and there were
 

5357
01:39:17,159 --> 01:39:20,629
intersection between them and there were
several Pioneers that of of my of the of

5358
01:39:20,629 --> 01:39:20,639
several Pioneers that of of my of the of
 

5359
01:39:20,639 --> 01:39:22,729
several Pioneers that of of my of the of
people at MIT like Bruno copy who's a

5360
01:39:22,729 --> 01:39:22,739
people at MIT like Bruno copy who's a
 

5361
01:39:22,739 --> 01:39:24,350
people at MIT like Bruno copy who's a
professor in the physics department and

5362
01:39:24,350 --> 01:39:24,360
professor in the physics department and
 

5363
01:39:24,360 --> 01:39:26,450
professor in the physics department and
Ron Parker who was a professor in

5364
01:39:26,450 --> 01:39:26,460
Ron Parker who was a professor in
 

5365
01:39:26,460 --> 01:39:27,770
Ron Parker who was a professor in
electrical engineering and nuclear

5366
01:39:27,770 --> 01:39:27,780
electrical engineering and nuclear
 

5367
01:39:27,780 --> 01:39:29,510
electrical engineering and nuclear
engineering it's like even the makeup of

5368
01:39:29,510 --> 01:39:29,520
engineering it's like even the makeup of
 

5369
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:31,550
engineering it's like even the makeup of
the people right has got this blends of

5370
01:39:31,550 --> 01:39:31,560
the people right has got this blends of
 

5371
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:33,350
the people right has got this blends of
Science and Engineering in them and

5372
01:39:33,350 --> 01:39:33,360
Science and Engineering in them and
 

5373
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:34,610
Science and Engineering in them and
that's actually was the origin of the

5374
01:39:34,610 --> 01:39:34,620
that's actually was the origin of the
 

5375
01:39:34,620 --> 01:39:36,410
that's actually was the origin of the
Plato science infusion center was was

5376
01:39:36,410 --> 01:39:36,420
Plato science infusion center was was
 

5377
01:39:36,420 --> 01:39:38,090
Plato science infusion center was was
doing those things so anyway so back to

5378
01:39:38,090 --> 01:39:38,100
doing those things so anyway so back to
 

5379
01:39:38,100 --> 01:39:40,850
doing those things so anyway so back to
this so why so yes tokamax have been

5380
01:39:40,850 --> 01:39:40,860
this so why so yes tokamax have been
 

5381
01:39:40,860 --> 01:39:43,129
this so why so yes tokamax have been
have achieved the highest in magnetic

5382
01:39:43,129 --> 01:39:43,139
have achieved the highest in magnetic
 

5383
01:39:43,139 --> 01:39:45,830
have achieved the highest in magnetic
Fusion by far like the the the best

5384
01:39:45,830 --> 01:39:45,840
Fusion by far like the the the best
 

5385
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:47,750
Fusion by far like the the the best
amounts of these of these conditions

5386
01:39:47,750 --> 01:39:47,760
amounts of these of these conditions
 

5387
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:49,610
amounts of these of these conditions
that I had talked about and in fact

5388
01:39:49,610 --> 01:39:49,620
that I had talked about and in fact
 

5389
01:39:49,620 --> 01:39:51,830
that I had talked about and in fact
pushed right up to the point where they

5390
01:39:51,830 --> 01:39:51,840
pushed right up to the point where they
 

5391
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:54,590
pushed right up to the point where they
were near QP of one they just didn't

5392
01:39:54,590 --> 01:39:54,600
were near QP of one they just didn't
 

5393
01:39:54,600 --> 01:39:56,689
were near QP of one they just didn't
quite get over one so can we actually

5394
01:39:56,689 --> 01:39:56,699
quite get over one so can we actually
 

5395
01:39:56,699 --> 01:39:58,729
quite get over one so can we actually
just Linger on the uh on the

5396
01:39:58,729 --> 01:39:58,739
just Linger on the uh on the
 

5397
01:39:58,739 --> 01:40:00,530
just Linger on the uh on the
collaboration across different nations

5398
01:40:00,530 --> 01:40:00,540
collaboration across different nations
 

5399
01:40:00,540 --> 01:40:02,689
collaboration across different nations
just um yeah maybe looking at the

5400
01:40:02,689 --> 01:40:02,699
just um yeah maybe looking at the
 

5401
01:40:02,699 --> 01:40:05,470
just um yeah maybe looking at the
philosophical aspect of this

5402
01:40:05,470 --> 01:40:05,480
philosophical aspect of this
 

5403
01:40:05,480 --> 01:40:08,450
philosophical aspect of this
even in the Cold War

5404
01:40:08,450 --> 01:40:08,460
even in the Cold War
 

5405
01:40:08,460 --> 01:40:10,970
even in the Cold War
there's something hopeful to me besides

5406
01:40:10,970 --> 01:40:10,980
there's something hopeful to me besides
 

5407
01:40:10,980 --> 01:40:13,070
there's something hopeful to me besides
the energy that these giant

5408
01:40:13,070 --> 01:40:13,080
the energy that these giant
 

5409
01:40:13,080 --> 01:40:15,649
the energy that these giant
International projects

5410
01:40:15,649 --> 01:40:15,659
International projects
 

5411
01:40:15,659 --> 01:40:18,950
International projects
are a really powerful way to ease some

5412
01:40:18,950 --> 01:40:18,960
are a really powerful way to ease some
 

5413
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:20,450
are a really powerful way to ease some
of the geopolitical tension even

5414
01:40:20,450 --> 01:40:20,460
of the geopolitical tension even
 

5415
01:40:20,460 --> 01:40:23,450
of the geopolitical tension even
military conflict across Nations there's

5416
01:40:23,450 --> 01:40:23,460
military conflict across Nations there's
 

5417
01:40:23,460 --> 01:40:24,649
military conflict across Nations there's
a

5418
01:40:24,649 --> 01:40:24,659
a
 

5419
01:40:24,659 --> 01:40:27,470
a
war in Ukraine

5420
01:40:27,470 --> 01:40:27,480
war in Ukraine
 

5421
01:40:27,480 --> 01:40:28,790
war in Ukraine
and Russia

5422
01:40:28,790 --> 01:40:28,800
and Russia
 

5423
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:31,490
and Russia
there's a brewing tension and conflict

5424
01:40:31,490 --> 01:40:31,500
there's a brewing tension and conflict
 

5425
01:40:31,500 --> 01:40:36,169
there's a brewing tension and conflict
with China just the world is still

5426
01:40:36,169 --> 01:40:36,179
with China just the world is still
 

5427
01:40:36,179 --> 01:40:40,450
with China just the world is still
um seeking military conflict cold or hot

5428
01:40:40,450 --> 01:40:40,460
um seeking military conflict cold or hot
 

5429
01:40:40,460 --> 01:40:42,890
um seeking military conflict cold or hot
what can you say about sort of the

5430
01:40:42,890 --> 01:40:42,900
what can you say about sort of the
 

5431
01:40:42,900 --> 01:40:44,450
what can you say about sort of the
lessons of the 20th century and these

5432
01:40:44,450 --> 01:40:44,460
lessons of the 20th century and these
 

5433
01:40:44,460 --> 01:40:46,850
lessons of the 20th century and these
giant projects uh in their ability to

5434
01:40:46,850 --> 01:40:46,860
giant projects uh in their ability to
 

5435
01:40:46,860 --> 01:40:48,649
giant projects uh in their ability to
ease some of this tension

5436
01:40:48,649 --> 01:40:48,659
ease some of this tension
 

5437
01:40:48,659 --> 01:40:51,290
ease some of this tension
so it's it's a great question so as I

5438
01:40:51,290 --> 01:40:51,300
so it's it's a great question so as I
 

5439
01:40:51,300 --> 01:40:52,790
so it's it's a great question so as I
said there was a reason because it was

5440
01:40:52,790 --> 01:40:52,800
said there was a reason because it was
 

5441
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:54,550
said there was a reason because it was
so hard that was one of the reasons they

5442
01:40:54,550 --> 01:40:54,560
so hard that was one of the reasons they
 

5443
01:40:54,560 --> 01:40:57,350
so hard that was one of the reasons they
they Declassified it um and actually

5444
01:40:57,350 --> 01:40:57,360
they Declassified it um and actually
 

5445
01:40:57,360 --> 01:40:59,510
they Declassified it um and actually
they started working together in some

5446
01:40:59,510 --> 01:40:59,520
they started working together in some
 

5447
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:01,970
they started working together in some
sense on it as well too and I think it

5448
01:41:01,970 --> 01:41:01,980
sense on it as well too and I think it
 

5449
01:41:01,980 --> 01:41:05,090
sense on it as well too and I think it
was really there was

5450
01:41:05,090 --> 01:41:05,100

 

5451
01:41:05,100 --> 01:41:08,629

you know and are you ristic or or

5452
01:41:08,629 --> 01:41:08,639
you know and are you ristic or or
 

5453
01:41:08,639 --> 01:41:10,250
you know and are you ristic or or
altruistic

5454
01:41:10,250 --> 01:41:10,260
altruistic
 

5455
01:41:10,260 --> 01:41:12,290
altruistic
um aspect to this it's like this is

5456
01:41:12,290 --> 01:41:12,300
um aspect to this it's like this is
 

5457
01:41:12,300 --> 01:41:15,229
um aspect to this it's like this is
something that could change you know the

5458
01:41:15,229 --> 01:41:15,239
something that could change you know the
 

5459
01:41:15,239 --> 01:41:17,570
something that could change you know the
future of humanity and its nature and

5460
01:41:17,570 --> 01:41:17,580
future of humanity and its nature and
 

5461
01:41:17,580 --> 01:41:19,490
future of humanity and its nature and
its relationship with energy isn't this

5462
01:41:19,490 --> 01:41:19,500
its relationship with energy isn't this
 

5463
01:41:19,500 --> 01:41:20,570
its relationship with energy isn't this
something that we should work on

5464
01:41:20,570 --> 01:41:20,580
something that we should work on
 

5465
01:41:20,580 --> 01:41:24,410
something that we should work on
together right and and and that went

5466
01:41:24,410 --> 01:41:24,420
together right and and and that went
 

5467

that's important for all of us whether
 

5559
01:43:11,400 --> 01:43:14,209
that's important for all of us whether
they pick a fusion project

5560
01:43:14,209 --> 01:43:14,219
they pick a fusion project
 

5561
01:43:14,219 --> 01:43:17,510
they pick a fusion project
and that was in the mid-1980s and

5562
01:43:17,510 --> 01:43:17,520
and that was in the mid-1980s and
 

5563
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:20,930
and that was in the mid-1980s and
actually then after so they basically

5564
01:43:20,930 --> 01:43:20,940
actually then after so they basically
 

5565
01:43:20,940 --> 01:43:22,430
actually then after so they basically
signed an agreement that they would move

5566

signed an agreement that they would move
 

5567
01:43:22,440 --> 01:43:24,709
signed an agreement that they would move
forward to like literally collaborate on

5568
01:43:24,709 --> 01:43:24,719
forward to like literally collaborate on
 

5569
01:43:24,719 --> 01:43:27,109
forward to like literally collaborate on
on a project whose idea would be to show

5570
01:43:27,109 --> 01:43:27,119
on a project whose idea would be to show
 

5571
01:43:27,119 --> 01:43:29,689
on a project whose idea would be to show
large net energy gain infusions

5572
01:43:29,689 --> 01:43:29,699
large net energy gain infusions
 

5573
01:43:29,699 --> 01:43:32,209
large net energy gain infusions
commercial viability and work together

5574
01:43:32,209 --> 01:43:32,219
commercial viability and work together
 

5575
01:43:32,219 --> 01:43:34,550
commercial viability and work together
on that and very soon after that Japan

5576
01:43:34,550 --> 01:43:34,560
on that and very soon after that Japan
 

5577
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:38,450

joined as did the European Union and now
 

5579
01:43:38,460 --> 01:43:42,530
joined as did the European Union and now
um that project it evolved over a long

5580
01:43:42,530 --> 01:43:42,540
um that project it evolved over a long
 

5581
01:43:42,540 --> 01:43:43,970
um that project it evolved over a long
period of time and had some interesting

5582
01:43:43,970 --> 01:43:43,980
period of time and had some interesting
 

5583
01:43:43,980 --> 01:43:46,850
period of time and had some interesting
political ramifications to it but in the

5584
01:43:46,850 --> 01:43:46,860
political ramifications to it but in the
 

5585
01:43:46,860 --> 01:43:49,550
political ramifications to it but in the
end this actually also had South Korea

5586
01:43:49,550 --> 01:43:49,560
end this actually also had South Korea
 

5587
01:43:49,560 --> 01:43:53,450
end this actually also had South Korea
India and China join as well too so

5588
01:43:53,450 --> 01:43:53,460
India and China join as well too so
 

5589
01:43:53,460 --> 01:43:56,149
India and China join as well too so
you're talking about make major

5590
01:43:56,149 --> 01:43:56,159
you're talking about make major
 

5591
01:43:56,159 --> 01:44:00,050
you're talking about make major
a major fraction of and now Russian of

5592
01:44:00,050 --> 01:44:00,060
a major fraction of and now Russian of
 

5593
01:44:00,060 --> 01:44:01,850
a major fraction of and now Russian of
course instead of the Soviet Union

we return to the giant magnet and maybe

5610
01:44:17,330 --> 01:44:17,340
we return to the giant magnet and maybe
 

5611
01:44:17,340 --> 01:44:19,129
we return to the giant magnet and maybe
even talk about spark and this stuff

5612
01:44:19,129 --> 01:44:19,139
even talk about spark and this stuff

purpose is a worthy one then it's

5624
01:44:31,790 --> 01:44:31,800
purpose is a worthy one then it's
 

5625
01:44:31,800 --> 01:44:34,129
purpose is a worthy one then it's
essentially an any Fusion device

5626
01:44:34,129 --> 01:44:34,139
essentially an any Fusion device
 

5627
01:44:34,139 --> 01:44:36,350
essentially an any Fusion device
the thing that you want to see is more

5628
01:44:36,350 --> 01:44:36,360
the thing that you want to see is more
 

5629
01:44:36,360 --> 01:44:37,609
the thing that you want to see is more
and more relative amounts of

5630
01:44:37,609 --> 01:44:37,619
and more relative amounts of
 

5631
01:44:37,619 --> 01:44:39,590
and more relative amounts of
self-heating and this is something that

5632
01:44:39,590 --> 01:44:39,600
self-heating and this is something that
 

5633
01:44:39,600 --> 01:44:41,209
self-heating and this is something that
had not been seen although although we

5634
01:44:41,209 --> 01:44:41,219
had not been seen although although we
 

5635
01:44:41,219 --> 01:44:43,370
had not been seen although although we
have made Fusion reactions and we'd seen

5636
01:44:43,370 --> 01:44:43,380
have made Fusion reactions and we'd seen
 

5637
01:44:43,380 --> 01:44:45,649
have made Fusion reactions and we'd seen
small amounts of the self-heating we

5638
01:44:45,649 --> 01:44:45,659
small amounts of the self-heating we
 

5639
01:44:45,659 --> 01:44:47,090
small amounts of the self-heating we
never got to a dominant this actually

5640
01:44:47,090 --> 01:44:47,100
never got to a dominant this actually
 

5641
01:44:47,100 --> 01:44:50,209
never got to a dominant this actually
goes to this QP business okay the goal

5642
01:44:50,209 --> 01:44:50,219
goes to this QP business okay the goal
 

5643
01:44:50,219 --> 01:44:52,550
goes to this QP business okay the goal
of eater and it shifted around a little

5644
01:44:52,550 --> 01:44:52,560
of eater and it shifted around a little
 

5645
01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:53,810
of eater and it shifted around a little
bit historically but very you know

5646
01:44:53,810 --> 01:44:53,820
bit historically but very you know
 

5647
01:44:53,820 --> 01:44:56,090
bit historically but very you know
fairly quickly became we want to get to

5648
01:44:56,090 --> 01:44:56,100
fairly quickly became we want to get to
 

5649
01:44:56,100 --> 01:44:58,310
fairly quickly became we want to get to
a large amount of self-heating so this

5650
01:44:58,310 --> 01:44:58,320
a large amount of self-heating so this
 

5651
01:44:58,320 --> 01:45:00,950
a large amount of self-heating so this
is why it has a its primary feature is

5652
01:45:00,950 --> 01:45:00,960
is why it has a its primary feature is
 

5653
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:04,189
is why it has a its primary feature is
to get 2qp of around 10 and through this

5654
01:45:04,189 --> 01:45:04,199
to get 2qp of around 10 and through this
 

5655
01:45:04,199 --> 01:45:07,729
to get 2qp of around 10 and through this
this is a way to study this plasma that

5656
01:45:07,729 --> 01:45:07,739
this is a way to study this plasma that
 

5657
01:45:07,739 --> 01:45:09,649
this is a way to study this plasma that
has more higher levels of

5658
01:45:09,649 --> 01:45:09,659
has more higher levels of
 

5659
01:45:09,659 --> 01:45:12,229
has more higher levels of
self-determination around on it

5660
01:45:12,229 --> 01:45:12,239
self-determination around on it
 

5661
01:45:12,239 --> 01:45:14,810
self-determination around on it
but it also has another feature which

5662
01:45:14,810 --> 01:45:14,820
but it also has another feature which
 

5663
01:45:14,820 --> 01:45:17,930
but it also has another feature which
was let's produce fusion power at a you

5664
01:45:17,930 --> 01:45:17,940
was let's produce fusion power at a you
 

5665
01:45:17,940 --> 01:45:19,609
was let's produce fusion power at a you
know relevant scale

5666
01:45:19,609 --> 01:45:19,619
know relevant scale
 

5667
01:45:19,619 --> 01:45:21,590
know relevant scale
and and actually they're linked together

5668
01:45:21,590 --> 01:45:21,600
and and actually they're linked together
 

5669
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:23,090
and and actually they're linked together
which actually makes sense you think

5670
01:45:23,090 --> 01:45:23,100
which actually makes sense you think
 

5671
01:45:23,100 --> 01:45:24,830
which actually makes sense you think
about it is that because the fusion

5672
01:45:24,830 --> 01:45:24,840
about it is that because the fusion
 

5673
01:45:24,840 --> 01:45:27,770
about it is that because the fusion
power is the heating Source itself this

5674
01:45:27,770 --> 01:45:27,780
power is the heating Source itself this
 

5675
01:45:27,780 --> 01:45:29,689
power is the heating Source itself this
means that they're linked together and

5676
01:45:29,689 --> 01:45:29,699
means that they're linked together and
 

5677
01:45:29,699 --> 01:45:32,689
means that they're linked together and
so either makes it is projected to make

5678
01:45:32,689 --> 01:45:32,699
so either makes it is projected to make
 

5679
01:45:32,699 --> 01:45:36,590
so either makes it is projected to make
about 500 million watts of fusion power

5680
01:45:36,590 --> 01:45:36,600
about 500 million watts of fusion power
 

5681
01:45:36,600 --> 01:45:38,750
about 500 million watts of fusion power
so this is a significant amount like

5682
01:45:38,750 --> 01:45:38,760
so this is a significant amount like
 

5683
01:45:38,760 --> 01:45:40,250
so this is a significant amount like
this is what you would use

5684
01:45:40,250 --> 01:45:40,260
this is what you would use
 

5685
01:45:40,260 --> 01:45:42,530
this is what you would use
you know for powering cities so it's not

5686
01:45:42,530 --> 01:45:42,540
you know for powering cities so it's not
 

5687
01:45:42,540 --> 01:45:44,629
you know for powering cities so it's not
just the research that really it is the

5688
01:45:44,629 --> 01:45:44,639
just the research that really it is the
 

5689
01:45:44,639 --> 01:45:46,070
just the research that really it is the
development of really trying to achieve

5690
01:45:46,070 --> 01:45:46,080
development of really trying to achieve
 

5691
01:45:46,080 --> 01:45:48,169
development of really trying to achieve
scale here so self-heating and scale

5692
01:45:48,169 --> 01:45:48,179
scale here so self-heating and scale
 

5693
01:45:48,179 --> 01:45:52,250
scale here so self-heating and scale
yeah yes so this this meant then too is

5694
01:45:52,250 --> 01:45:52,260
yeah yes so this this meant then too is
 

5695
01:45:52,260 --> 01:45:54,950
yeah yes so this this meant then too is
the the development of an industrial

5696
01:45:54,950 --> 01:45:54,960
the the development of an industrial
 

5697
01:45:54,960 --> 01:45:56,629
the the development of an industrial
base that can actually produce the

5698
01:45:56,629 --> 01:45:56,639
base that can actually produce the
 

5699
01:45:56,639 --> 01:45:58,430
base that can actually produce the
Technologies like the electromagnets and

5700
01:45:58,430 --> 01:45:58,440
Technologies like the electromagnets and
 

5701
01:45:58,440 --> 01:46:00,410
Technologies like the electromagnets and
so forth and to do it with it is a

5702
01:46:00,410 --> 01:46:00,420
so forth and to do it with it is a
 

5703
01:46:00,420 --> 01:46:03,229
so forth and to do it with it is a
Tokamak it is it is one of these yes but

5704
01:46:03,229 --> 01:46:03,239
Tokamak it is it is one of these yes but
 

5705
01:46:03,239 --> 01:46:04,669
Tokamak it is it is one of these yes but
very interesting it also revealed

5706
01:46:04,669 --> 01:46:04,679
very interesting it also revealed
 

5707
01:46:04,679 --> 01:46:07,910
very interesting it also revealed
limitations of of this as well too well

5708
01:46:07,910 --> 01:46:07,920
limitations of of this as well too well
 

5709
01:46:07,920 --> 01:46:10,790
limitations of of this as well too well
it is it's interesting is that it is

5710
01:46:10,790 --> 01:46:10,800
it is it's interesting is that it is
 

5711
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:12,709
it is it's interesting is that it is
clearly a

5712
01:46:12,709 --> 01:46:12,719
clearly a
 

5713
01:46:12,719 --> 01:46:15,890
clearly a
um on paper and in fact in in practice

5714
01:46:15,890 --> 01:46:15,900
um on paper and in fact in in practice
 

5715
01:46:15,900 --> 01:46:18,709
um on paper and in fact in in practice
as well too the world the world you know

5716
01:46:18,709 --> 01:46:18,719
as well too the world the world you know
 

5717
01:46:18,719 --> 01:46:21,229
as well too the world the world you know
and very different political systems and

5718
01:46:21,229 --> 01:46:21,239
and very different political systems and
 

5719
01:46:21,239 --> 01:46:22,910
and very different political systems and
you caught you consider at least

5720
01:46:22,910 --> 01:46:22,920
you caught you consider at least
 

5721
01:46:22,920 --> 01:46:25,370
you caught you consider at least
geopolitical or economic rivals or

5722
01:46:25,370 --> 01:46:25,380
geopolitical or economic rivals or
 

5723
01:46:25,380 --> 01:46:27,169
geopolitical or economic rivals or
whatever you want to use like working

5724
01:46:27,169 --> 01:46:27,179
whatever you want to use like working
 

5725
01:46:27,179 --> 01:46:30,470
whatever you want to use like working
towards a common cause and one that we

5726
01:46:30,470 --> 01:46:30,480
towards a common cause and one that we
 

5727
01:46:30,480 --> 01:46:32,750
towards a common cause and one that we
all think is Worthy is is very like okay

5728
01:46:32,750 --> 01:46:32,760
all think is Worthy is is very like okay
 

5729
01:46:32,760 --> 01:46:35,270
all think is Worthy is is very like okay
that's very satisfying but it's also

5730
01:46:35,270 --> 01:46:35,280
that's very satisfying but it's also
 

5731
01:46:35,280 --> 01:46:37,609
that's very satisfying but it's also
interesting to see the limitations of

5732
01:46:37,609 --> 01:46:37,619
interesting to see the limitations of
 

5733
01:46:37,619 --> 01:46:40,189
interesting to see the limitations of
this it's because well you've got seven

5734
01:46:40,189 --> 01:46:40,199
this it's because well you've got seven
 

5735
01:46:40,199 --> 01:46:43,370
this it's because well you've got seven
you know chefs in the kitchen

5736
01:46:43,370 --> 01:46:43,380
you know chefs in the kitchen
 

5737
01:46:43,380 --> 01:46:45,410
you know chefs in the kitchen
so what is this what does this meant in

5738
01:46:45,410 --> 01:46:45,420
so what is this what does this meant in
 

5739
01:46:45,420 --> 01:46:48,109
so what is this what does this meant in
terms of the speed of the project and

5740
01:46:48,109 --> 01:46:48,119
terms of the speed of the project and
 

5741
01:46:48,119 --> 01:46:50,209
terms of the speed of the project and
the ability to to govern it and so forth

5742
01:46:50,209 --> 01:46:50,219
the ability to to govern it and so forth
 

5743
01:46:50,219 --> 01:46:52,430
the ability to to govern it and so forth
it's just been a challenge uh honestly

5744
01:46:52,430 --> 01:46:52,440
it's just been a challenge uh honestly
 

5745
01:46:52,440 --> 01:46:55,250
it's just been a challenge uh honestly
around this and this is I mean it's very

5746
01:46:55,250 --> 01:46:55,260
around this and this is I mean it's very
 

5747
01:46:55,260 --> 01:46:56,930
around this and this is I mean it's very
hard technically what's what's occurring

5748
01:46:56,930 --> 01:46:56,940
hard technically what's what's occurring
 

5749
01:46:56,940 --> 01:46:59,689
hard technically what's what's occurring
but when you also introduce such levels

5750
01:46:59,689 --> 01:46:59,699
but when you also introduce such levels
 

5751
01:46:59,699 --> 01:47:01,669
but when you also introduce such levels
of I mean this isn't just me saying it

5752
01:47:01,669 --> 01:47:01,679
of I mean this isn't just me saying it
 

5753
01:47:01,679 --> 01:47:03,590
of I mean this isn't just me saying it
there's like GAO reports from the US

5754
01:47:03,590 --> 01:47:03,600
there's like GAO reports from the US
 

5755
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:05,450
there's like GAO reports from the US
government and so on this is It's hard

5756
01:47:05,450 --> 01:47:05,460
government and so on this is It's hard
 

5757
01:47:05,460 --> 01:47:08,510
government and so on this is It's hard
to like steer all of this around

5758
01:47:08,510 --> 01:47:08,520
to like steer all of this around
 

5759
01:47:08,520 --> 01:47:10,910
to like steer all of this around
um and what that's tended to do is make

5760
01:47:10,910 --> 01:47:10,920
um and what that's tended to do is make
 

5761
01:47:10,920 --> 01:47:13,370
um and what that's tended to do is make
it it's it's not the fastest decision

5762
01:47:13,370 --> 01:47:13,380
it it's it's not the fastest decision
 

5763
01:47:13,380 --> 01:47:16,010
it it's it's not the fastest decision
making process you know my own personal

5764
01:47:16,010 --> 01:47:16,020
making process you know my own personal
 

5765
01:47:16,020 --> 01:47:17,810
making process you know my own personal
view of it was it was it was interesting

5766
01:47:17,810 --> 01:47:17,820
view of it was it was it was interesting
 

5767
01:47:17,820 --> 01:47:19,189
view of it was it was it was interesting
because you asked me you said about the

5768
01:47:19,189 --> 01:47:19,199
because you asked me you said about the
 

5769
01:47:19,199 --> 01:47:21,410
because you asked me you said about the
magnet and Commonwealth Fusion systems

5770
01:47:21,410 --> 01:47:21,420
magnet and Commonwealth Fusion systems
 

5771
01:47:21,420 --> 01:47:25,189
magnet and Commonwealth Fusion systems
it was I worked most of my career on

5772
01:47:25,189 --> 01:47:25,199
it was I worked most of my career on
 

5773
01:47:25,199 --> 01:47:27,169
it was I worked most of my career on
eater because when I came into the field

5774
01:47:27,169 --> 01:47:27,179
eater because when I came into the field
 

5775
01:47:27,179 --> 01:47:30,350
eater because when I came into the field
in the early 1990s when I completed my

5776
01:47:30,350 --> 01:47:30,360
in the early 1990s when I completed my
 

5777
01:47:30,360 --> 01:47:33,229
in the early 1990s when I completed my
PhD and started to work this was one of

5778
01:47:33,229 --> 01:47:33,239
PhD and started to work this was one of
 

5779
01:47:33,239 --> 01:47:35,030
PhD and started to work this was one of
the most like you can't imagine being

5780
01:47:35,030 --> 01:47:35,040
the most like you can't imagine being
 

5781
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:36,770
the most like you can't imagine being
more excited about something like we're

5782
01:47:36,770 --> 01:47:36,780
more excited about something like we're
 

5783
01:47:36,780 --> 01:47:38,270
more excited about something like we're
going to change the world with this

5784
01:47:38,270 --> 01:47:38,280
going to change the world with this
 

5785
01:47:38,280 --> 01:47:39,470
going to change the world with this
project we're going to do these things

5786
01:47:39,470 --> 01:47:39,480
project we're going to do these things
 

5787
01:47:39,480 --> 01:47:42,590
project we're going to do these things
and we just like Port like an entire

5788
01:47:42,590 --> 01:47:42,600
and we just like Port like an entire
 

5789
01:47:42,600 --> 01:47:44,930
and we just like Port like an entire
generation and afterwards as well too is

5790
01:47:44,930 --> 01:47:44,940
generation and afterwards as well too is
 

5791
01:47:44,940 --> 01:47:46,790
generation and afterwards as well too is
just poured their imagination and their

5792
01:47:46,790 --> 01:47:46,800
just poured their imagination and their
 

5793
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:48,530
just poured their imagination and their
creativity about making this thing work

5794
01:47:48,530 --> 01:47:48,540
creativity about making this thing work
 

5795
01:47:48,540 --> 01:47:51,109
creativity about making this thing work
very good but at also at some point

5796
01:47:51,109 --> 01:47:51,119
very good but at also at some point
 

5797
01:47:51,119 --> 01:47:53,390
very good but at also at some point
though when you know when it got to

5798
01:47:53,390 --> 01:47:53,400
though when you know when it got to
 

5799
01:47:53,400 --> 01:47:56,149
though when you know when it got to
being another five years of delay or a

5800
01:47:56,149 --> 01:47:56,159
being another five years of delay or a
 

5801
01:47:56,159 --> 01:47:57,830
being another five years of delay or a
decade of delay you start asking

5802
01:47:57,830 --> 01:47:57,840
decade of delay you start asking
 

5803
01:47:57,840 --> 01:48:00,050
decade of delay you start asking
yourself well is this what I want to do

5804
01:48:00,050 --> 01:48:00,060
yourself well is this what I want to do
 

5805
01:48:00,060 --> 01:48:02,930
yourself well is this what I want to do
right am I going to wait for for this so

5806
01:48:02,930 --> 01:48:02,940
right am I going to wait for for this so
 

5807
01:48:02,940 --> 01:48:05,030
right am I going to wait for for this so
it was a part of me starting to ask

5808
01:48:05,030 --> 01:48:05,040
it was a part of me starting to ask
 

5809
01:48:05,040 --> 01:48:08,510
it was a part of me starting to ask
questions with my students I was like

5810
01:48:08,510 --> 01:48:08,520
questions with my students I was like
 

5811
01:48:08,520 --> 01:48:11,149
questions with my students I was like
is there another way that we can get to

5812
01:48:11,149 --> 01:48:11,159
is there another way that we can get to
 

5813
01:48:11,159 --> 01:48:13,370
is there another way that we can get to
this extremely worthwhile goal that

5814
01:48:13,370 --> 01:48:13,380
this extremely worthwhile goal that
 

5815
01:48:13,380 --> 01:48:15,770
this extremely worthwhile goal that
maybe maybe it's not that that maybe

5816
01:48:15,770 --> 01:48:15,780
maybe maybe it's not that that maybe
 

5817
01:48:15,780 --> 01:48:17,689
maybe maybe it's not that that maybe
it's not that pathway and the other part

5818
01:48:17,689 --> 01:48:17,699
it's not that pathway and the other part
 

5819
01:48:17,699 --> 01:48:19,430
it's not that pathway and the other part
that was clearly frustrating to me

5820
01:48:19,430 --> 01:48:19,440
that was clearly frustrating to me
 

5821
01:48:19,440 --> 01:48:22,129
that was clearly frustrating to me
because I I'm an advocate of fusion you

5822
01:48:22,129 --> 01:48:22,139
because I I'm an advocate of fusion you
 

5823
01:48:22,139 --> 01:48:23,930
because I I'm an advocate of fusion you
asked me about was I you know I was like

5824
01:48:23,930 --> 01:48:23,940
asked me about was I you know I was like
 

5825
01:48:23,940 --> 01:48:26,330
asked me about was I you know I was like
well it's laser Fusion or inertia or

5826
01:48:26,330 --> 01:48:26,340
well it's laser Fusion or inertia or
 

5827
01:48:26,340 --> 01:48:28,490
well it's laser Fusion or inertia or
inertial Fusion or magnetic Fusion I

5828
01:48:28,490 --> 01:48:28,500
inertial Fusion or magnetic Fusion I
 

5829
01:48:28,500 --> 01:48:30,530
inertial Fusion or magnetic Fusion I
just want Fusion Energy okay because I

5830
01:48:30,530 --> 01:48:30,540
just want Fusion Energy okay because I
 

5831
01:48:30,540 --> 01:48:33,350
just want Fusion Energy okay because I
think it's so important to the world is

5832
01:48:33,350 --> 01:48:33,360
think it's so important to the world is
 

5833
01:48:33,360 --> 01:48:35,810
think it's so important to the world is
that but the other thing if that's the

5834
01:48:35,810 --> 01:48:35,820
that but the other thing if that's the
 

5835
01:48:35,820 --> 01:48:37,310
that but the other thing if that's the
case

5836
01:48:37,310 --> 01:48:37,320
case
 

5837
01:48:37,320 --> 01:48:41,510
case
then why do we have only one attempt at

5838
01:48:41,510 --> 01:48:41,520
then why do we have only one attempt at
 

5839
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:44,930
then why do we have only one attempt at
it on the entire planet which was either

5840
01:48:44,930 --> 01:48:44,940
it on the entire planet which was either
 

5841
01:48:44,940 --> 01:48:47,030
it on the entire planet which was either
it's like that makes no sense to me

5842
01:48:47,030 --> 01:48:47,040
it's like that makes no sense to me
 

5843
01:48:47,040 --> 01:48:49,669
it's like that makes no sense to me
right we should have multiple attempts

5844
01:48:49,669 --> 01:48:49,679
right we should have multiple attempts
 

5845
01:48:49,679 --> 01:48:52,490
right we should have multiple attempts
at this with different levels of

5846
01:48:52,490 --> 01:48:52,500
at this with different levels of
 

5847
01:48:52,500 --> 01:48:54,470
at this with different levels of
whatever you want to think about a

5848
01:48:54,470 --> 01:48:54,480
whatever you want to think about a
 

5849
01:48:54,480 --> 01:48:56,870
whatever you want to think about a
technical schedule scientific risk which

5850
01:48:56,870 --> 01:48:56,880
technical schedule scientific risk which
 

5851
01:48:56,880 --> 01:48:58,310
technical schedule scientific risk which
are Incorporated in them and that's

5852
01:48:58,310 --> 01:48:58,320
are Incorporated in them and that's
 

5853
01:48:58,320 --> 01:48:59,510
are Incorporated in them and that's
going to give us a better chance of

5854
01:48:59,510 --> 01:48:59,520
going to give us a better chance of
 

5855
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:01,729
going to give us a better chance of
actually getting to the goal line with

5856
01:49:01,729 --> 01:49:01,739
actually getting to the goal line with
 

5857
01:49:01,739 --> 01:49:03,890
actually getting to the goal line with
that Spirit your leading mit's effort to

5858
01:49:03,890 --> 01:49:03,900
that Spirit your leading mit's effort to
 

5859
01:49:03,900 --> 01:49:07,729
that Spirit your leading mit's effort to
design spark a compact High field DT

5860
01:49:07,729 --> 01:49:07,739
design spark a compact High field DT
 

5861
01:49:07,739 --> 01:49:09,530
design spark a compact High field DT
burning takamak

5862
01:49:09,530 --> 01:49:09,540
burning takamak
 

5863
01:49:09,540 --> 01:49:11,990
burning takamak
how does it work what is it what's the

5864
01:49:11,990 --> 01:49:12,000
how does it work what is it what's the
 

5865
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,390
how does it work what is it what's the
motivation uh what's the design what are

5866
01:49:14,390 --> 01:49:14,400
motivation uh what's the design what are
 

5867
01:49:14,400 --> 01:49:16,550
motivation uh what's the design what are
the ideas behind it yeah at its heart

5868
01:49:16,550 --> 01:49:16,560
the ideas behind it yeah at its heart
 

5869
01:49:16,560 --> 01:49:18,530
the ideas behind it yeah at its heart
it's exactly the same concept as eater

5870
01:49:18,530 --> 01:49:18,540
it's exactly the same concept as eater
 

5871
01:49:18,540 --> 01:49:20,990
it's exactly the same concept as eater
this is basically a configuration of

5872
01:49:20,990 --> 01:49:21,000
this is basically a configuration of
 

5873
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,270
this is basically a configuration of
electromagnets it's arranged in the

5874
01:49:23,270 --> 01:49:23,280
electromagnets it's arranged in the
 

5875
01:49:23,280 --> 01:49:25,550
electromagnets it's arranged in the
shape of a donut and within that we will

5876
01:49:25,550 --> 01:49:25,560
shape of a donut and within that we will
 

5877
01:49:25,560 --> 01:49:27,050
shape of a donut and within that we will
do we would do the same thing that

5878
01:49:27,050 --> 01:49:27,060
do we would do the same thing that
 

5879
01:49:27,060 --> 01:49:29,209
do we would do the same thing that
happens in all the other token Max and

5880
01:49:29,209 --> 01:49:29,219
happens in all the other token Max and
 

5881
01:49:29,219 --> 01:49:31,070
happens in all the other token Max and
including an eater and in this one is

5882
01:49:31,070 --> 01:49:31,080
including an eater and in this one is
 

5883
01:49:31,080 --> 01:49:32,930
including an eater and in this one is
that namely you put in gas make it into

5884
01:49:32,930 --> 01:49:32,940
that namely you put in gas make it into
 

5885
01:49:32,940 --> 01:49:35,270
that namely you put in gas make it into
a plasma you heat it up it gets about

5886
01:49:35,270 --> 01:49:35,280
a plasma you heat it up it gets about
 

5887
01:49:35,280 --> 01:49:37,070
a plasma you heat it up it gets about
100 million degrees

5888
01:49:37,070 --> 01:49:37,080
100 million degrees
 

5889
01:49:37,080 --> 01:49:40,370
100 million degrees
the differentiator in spark is that we

5890
01:49:40,370 --> 01:49:40,380
the differentiator in spark is that we
 

5891
01:49:40,380 --> 01:49:42,790
the differentiator in spark is that we
use the actual deuterium tritium Fuel

5892
01:49:42,790 --> 01:49:42,800
use the actual deuterium tritium Fuel
 

5893
01:49:42,800 --> 01:49:46,729
use the actual deuterium tritium Fuel
and because of the access to very high

5894
01:49:46,729 --> 01:49:46,739
and because of the access to very high
 

5895
01:49:46,739 --> 01:49:49,850
and because of the access to very high
magnetic fields it's in a very compact

5896
01:49:49,850 --> 01:49:49,860
magnetic fields it's in a very compact
 

5897
01:49:49,860 --> 01:49:53,810
magnetic fields it's in a very compact
space it's very very small

5898
01:49:53,810 --> 01:49:53,820
space it's very very small
 

5899
01:49:53,820 --> 01:49:57,169
space it's very very small
what I mean by small so it's 40 times

5900
01:49:57,169 --> 01:49:57,179
what I mean by small so it's 40 times
 

5901
01:49:57,179 --> 01:50:00,649
what I mean by small so it's 40 times
smaller in volume than either but it

5902
01:50:00,649 --> 01:50:00,659
smaller in volume than either but it
 

5903
01:50:00,659 --> 01:50:02,090
smaller in volume than either but it
uses exactly the same physical

5904
01:50:02,090 --> 01:50:02,100
uses exactly the same physical
 

5905
01:50:02,100 --> 01:50:04,250
uses exactly the same physical
principles so this comes from the high

5906
01:50:04,250 --> 01:50:04,260
principles so this comes from the high
 

5907
01:50:04,260 --> 01:50:06,470
principles so this comes from the high
magnetic field so in the end like what

5908
01:50:06,470 --> 01:50:06,480
magnetic field so in the end like what
 

5909
01:50:06,480 --> 01:50:08,149
magnetic field so in the end like what
is why does this matter what it does is

5910
01:50:08,149 --> 01:50:08,159
is why does this matter what it does is
 

5911
01:50:08,159 --> 01:50:10,490
is why does this matter what it does is
it does those things and it should get

5912
01:50:10,490 --> 01:50:10,500
it does those things and it should get
 

5913
01:50:10,500 --> 01:50:12,410
it does those things and it should get
to the point where it's producing over

5914
01:50:12,410 --> 01:50:12,420
to the point where it's producing over
 

5915
01:50:12,420 --> 01:50:15,770
to the point where it's producing over
100 million watts of fusion power

5916
01:50:15,770 --> 01:50:15,780
100 million watts of fusion power
 

5917
01:50:15,780 --> 01:50:18,169
100 million watts of fusion power
but remember it's 40 times smaller so

5918
01:50:18,169 --> 01:50:18,179
but remember it's 40 times smaller so
 

5919
01:50:18,179 --> 01:50:21,470
but remember it's 40 times smaller so
either was 500 megawatts technically our

5920
01:50:21,470 --> 01:50:21,480
either was 500 megawatts technically our
 

5921
01:50:21,480 --> 01:50:24,050
either was 500 megawatts technically our
design is around 150 megawatts so it's

5922
01:50:24,050 --> 01:50:24,060
design is around 150 megawatts so it's
 

5923
01:50:24,060 --> 01:50:25,310
design is around 150 megawatts so it's
only about a factor of three difference

5924
01:50:25,310 --> 01:50:25,320
only about a factor of three difference
 

5925
01:50:25,320 --> 01:50:28,729
only about a factor of three difference
despite being 40 times smaller

5926
01:50:28,729 --> 01:50:28,739
despite being 40 times smaller
 

5927
01:50:28,739 --> 01:50:30,950
despite being 40 times smaller
um and we see

5928
01:50:30,950 --> 01:50:30,960
um and we see
 

5929
01:50:30,960 --> 01:50:32,950
um and we see
um QP large

5930
01:50:32,950 --> 01:50:32,960
um QP large
 

5931
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:35,689
um QP large
order of 10 or something like this at

5932
01:50:35,689 --> 01:50:35,699
order of 10 or something like this at
 

5933
01:50:35,699 --> 01:50:38,090
order of 10 or something like this at
that at that at that state is very

5934
01:50:38,090 --> 01:50:38,100
that at that at that state is very
 

5935
01:50:38,100 --> 01:50:40,310
that at that at that state is very
important scientifically because this is

5936
01:50:40,310 --> 01:50:40,320
important scientifically because this is
 

5937
01:50:40,320 --> 01:50:42,050
important scientifically because this is
basically matches what eater is looking

5938
01:50:42,050 --> 01:50:42,060
basically matches what eater is looking
 

5939
01:50:42,060 --> 01:50:44,930
basically matches what eater is looking
to do the plasma is dominated by its own

5940
01:50:44,930 --> 01:50:44,940
to do the plasma is dominated by its own
 

5941
01:50:44,940 --> 01:50:47,689
to do the plasma is dominated by its own
heating that's very very important and

5942
01:50:47,689 --> 01:50:47,699
heating that's very very important and
 

5943
01:50:47,699 --> 01:50:50,570
heating that's very very important and
it does that for about 10 seconds

5944
01:50:50,570 --> 01:50:50,580
it does that for about 10 seconds
 

5945
01:50:50,580 --> 01:50:52,430
it does that for about 10 seconds
and the reason it's for 10 seconds is

5946
01:50:52,430 --> 01:50:52,440
and the reason it's for 10 seconds is
 

5947
01:50:52,440 --> 01:50:54,470
and the reason it's for 10 seconds is
that in terms of that that basically

5948
01:50:54,470 --> 01:50:54,480
that in terms of that that basically
 

5949
01:50:54,480 --> 01:50:56,570
that in terms of that that basically
allows everything to settle in terms of

5950
01:50:56,570 --> 01:50:56,580
allows everything to settle in terms of
 

5951
01:50:56,580 --> 01:50:59,149
allows everything to settle in terms of
the fusion in the plasma equilibrium

5952
01:50:59,149 --> 01:50:59,159
the fusion in the plasma equilibrium
 

5953
01:50:59,159 --> 01:51:01,790
the fusion in the plasma equilibrium
everything is nice and settled so you

5954
01:51:01,790 --> 01:51:01,800
everything is nice and settled so you
 

5955
01:51:01,800 --> 01:51:04,490
everything is nice and settled so you
know you have seen the physical state at

5956
01:51:04,490 --> 01:51:04,500
know you have seen the physical state at
 

5957
01:51:04,500 --> 01:51:06,649
know you have seen the physical state at
which you would expect a power plant to

5958
01:51:06,649 --> 01:51:06,659
which you would expect a power plant to
 

5959
01:51:06,659 --> 01:51:08,810
which you would expect a power plant to
operate basically for for magnetic

5960
01:51:08,810 --> 01:51:08,820
operate basically for for magnetic
 

5961
01:51:08,820 --> 01:51:11,209
operate basically for for magnetic
Fusion like wow right

5962
01:51:11,209 --> 01:51:11,219
Fusion like wow right
 

5963
01:51:11,219 --> 01:51:13,970
Fusion like wow right
but it's more than that and it's more

5964
01:51:13,970 --> 01:51:13,980
but it's more than that and it's more
 

5965
01:51:13,980 --> 01:51:15,649
but it's more than that and it's more
than that it's because about who's

5966
01:51:15,649 --> 01:51:15,659
than that it's because about who's
 

5967
01:51:15,659 --> 01:51:17,689
than that it's because about who's
building it and why and how it's being

5968
01:51:17,689 --> 01:51:17,699
building it and why and how it's being
 

5969
01:51:17,699 --> 01:51:19,430
building it and why and how it's being
financed

5970
01:51:19,430 --> 01:51:19,440
financed
 

5971
01:51:19,440 --> 01:51:22,370

um so that scientific pathway was made

5972
01:51:22,370 --> 01:51:22,380
um so that scientific pathway was made
 

5973
01:51:22,380 --> 01:51:24,350
um so that scientific pathway was made
possible by the fact that we had access

5974
01:51:24,350 --> 01:51:24,360
possible by the fact that we had access
 

5975
01:51:24,360 --> 01:51:27,709
possible by the fact that we had access
to a next generation of magnet

5976
01:51:27,709 --> 01:51:27,719
to a next generation of magnet
 

5977
01:51:27,719 --> 01:51:29,810
to a next generation of magnet
technology so to explain this real quick

5978
01:51:29,810 --> 01:51:29,820
technology so to explain this real quick
 

5979
01:51:29,820 --> 01:51:32,030
technology so to explain this real quick
why do we call it you you said it in the

5980
01:51:32,030 --> 01:51:32,040
why do we call it you you said it in the
 

5981
01:51:32,040 --> 01:51:33,830
why do we call it you you said it in the
words a superconducting magnet what does

5982
01:51:33,830 --> 01:51:33,840
words a superconducting magnet what does
 

5983
01:51:33,840 --> 01:51:34,669

this mean

5984
01:51:34,669 --> 01:51:34,679
this mean
 

5985
01:51:34,679 --> 01:51:36,470
this mean
superconducting magnet means that the

5986
01:51:36,470 --> 01:51:36,480
superconducting magnet means that the
 

5987
01:51:36,480 --> 01:51:38,270
superconducting magnet means that the
materials which are in the electromagnet

5988
01:51:38,270 --> 01:51:38,280
materials which are in the electromagnet
 

5989
01:51:38,280 --> 01:51:41,149
materials which are in the electromagnet
have no electrical resistance therefore

5990
01:51:41,149 --> 01:51:41,159
have no electrical resistance therefore
 

5991
01:51:41,159 --> 01:51:43,910
have no electrical resistance therefore
when the electric current is put into it

5992
01:51:43,910 --> 01:51:43,920
when the electric current is put into it
 

5993
01:51:43,920 --> 01:51:46,850
when the electric current is put into it
the current goes around unimpeded so it

5994
01:51:46,850 --> 01:51:46,860
the current goes around unimpeded so it
 

5995
01:51:46,860 --> 01:51:48,229
the current goes around unimpeded so it
could basically keep going around and

5996
01:51:48,229 --> 01:51:48,239
could basically keep going around and
 

5997
01:51:48,239 --> 01:51:49,629
could basically keep going around and
around you know technically for infinity

5998
01:51:49,629 --> 01:51:49,639
around you know technically for infinity
 

5999
01:51:49,639 --> 01:51:52,430
around you know technically for infinity
and what that means are for eternity and

6000
01:51:52,430 --> 01:51:52,440
and what that means are for eternity and
 

6001
01:51:52,440 --> 01:51:55,189
and what that means are for eternity and
what that means is that the um when you

6002
01:51:55,189 --> 01:51:55,199
what that means is that the um when you
 

6003
01:51:55,199 --> 01:51:57,109
what that means is that the um when you
energize these large electromagnets

6004
01:51:57,109 --> 01:51:57,119
energize these large electromagnets
 

6005
01:51:57,119 --> 01:51:59,330
energize these large electromagnets
they're they're using basically zero

6006
01:51:59,330 --> 01:51:59,340
they're they're using basically zero
 

6007
01:51:59,340 --> 01:52:01,250
they're they're using basically zero
electrical power to maintain them

whereas if you would do this in a normal

6010
01:52:03,770 --> 01:52:03,780
whereas if you would do this in a normal
 

6011
01:52:03,780 --> 01:52:06,890
whereas if you would do this in a normal
wire like copper you basically make an

6012
01:52:06,890 --> 01:52:06,900
wire like copper you basically make an
 

6013
01:52:06,900 --> 01:52:09,050
wire like copper you basically make an
enormous toaster oven that's consuming

6014
01:52:09,050 --> 01:52:09,060
enormous toaster oven that's consuming
 

6015
01:52:09,060 --> 01:52:10,729
enormous toaster oven that's consuming
enormous amounts of power and getting

01:52:10,729 --> 01:52:10,739
enormous amounts of power and getting
 

6017
01:52:10,739 --> 01:52:13,370
enormous amounts of power and getting
hot which is the problem that was the

01:52:19,430 --> 01:52:19,440
by myself and at the time my students
 

6023
01:52:19,440 --> 01:52:22,490
by myself and at the time my students
and postdocs and colleagues at MIT was

01:52:22,490 --> 01:52:22,500
and postdocs and colleagues at MIT was
 

6025
01:52:22,500 --> 01:52:25,970
and postdocs and colleagues at MIT was
that we we saw the Advent of this new

6026
01:52:25,970 --> 01:52:25,980
that we we saw the Advent of this new
 

6027
01:52:25,980 --> 01:52:28,010
that we we saw the Advent of this new
this new superconducting material which

6028
01:52:28,010 --> 01:52:28,020
this new superconducting material which
 

6029
01:52:28,020 --> 01:52:29,810
this new superconducting material which
would allow us to access much higher

6030
01:52:29,810 --> 01:52:29,820
would allow us to access much higher
 

6031
01:52:29,820 --> 01:52:31,490
would allow us to access much higher
magnetic fields is basically the next

6032
01:52:31,490 --> 01:52:31,500
magnetic fields is basically the next
 

6033
01:52:31,500 --> 01:52:34,550
magnetic fields is basically the next
generation of the technology and

6034
01:52:34,550 --> 01:52:34,560
generation of the technology and
 

6035
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:36,709
generation of the technology and
um and it was quite disruptive diffusion

6036
01:52:36,709 --> 01:52:36,719
um and it was quite disruptive diffusion
 

6037
01:52:36,719 --> 01:52:38,629
um and it was quite disruptive diffusion
that namely what it would allow that if

6038
01:52:38,629 --> 01:52:38,639
that namely what it would allow that if
 

6039
01:52:38,639 --> 01:52:40,070
that namely what it would allow that if
we could if we could get to this point

6040
01:52:40,070 --> 01:52:40,080
we could if we could get to this point
 

6041
01:52:40,080 --> 01:52:42,830
we could if we could get to this point
where we can make the round 20 Tesla We

6042
01:52:42,830 --> 01:52:42,840
where we can make the round 20 Tesla We
 

6043
01:52:42,840 --> 01:52:45,169
where we can make the round 20 Tesla We
Knew by the rules of tokamax that this

6044
01:52:45,169 --> 01:52:45,179
Knew by the rules of tokamax that this
 

6045
01:52:45,179 --> 01:52:47,450
Knew by the rules of tokamax that this
was going to be is going to allow us to

6046
01:52:47,450 --> 01:52:47,460
was going to be is going to allow us to
 

6047
01:52:47,460 --> 01:52:50,209
was going to be is going to allow us to
vastly shrink like the sizes of these

6048
01:52:50,209 --> 01:52:50,219
vastly shrink like the sizes of these
 

6049
01:52:50,219 --> 01:52:52,550
vastly shrink like the sizes of these
devices so it wouldn't take

6050
01:52:52,550 --> 01:52:52,560
devices so it wouldn't take
 

6051
01:52:52,560 --> 01:52:54,109
devices so it wouldn't take
um although although it's a worthy goal

6052
01:52:54,109 --> 01:52:54,119
um although although it's a worthy goal
 

6053
01:52:54,119 --> 01:52:55,970
um although although it's a worthy goal
it wouldn't take a seven nation

6054
01:52:55,970 --> 01:52:55,980
it wouldn't take a seven nation
 

6055
01:52:55,980 --> 01:52:58,189
it wouldn't take a seven nation
International you know treaty basically

6056
01:52:58,189 --> 01:52:58,199
International you know treaty basically
 

6057
01:52:58,199 --> 01:53:00,169
International you know treaty basically
to build it you could build it with a

6058
01:53:00,169 --> 01:53:00,179
to build it you could build it with a
 

6059
01:53:00,179 --> 01:53:02,450
to build it you could build it with a
company and a university it's the same

6060
01:53:02,450 --> 01:53:02,460
company and a university it's the same
 

6061
01:53:02,460 --> 01:53:04,310
company and a university it's the same
kind of design but now using the

6062
01:53:04,310 --> 01:53:04,320
kind of design but now using the
 

6063
01:53:04,320 --> 01:53:06,410
kind of design but now using the
superconducting magnets yeah and if in

6064
01:53:06,410 --> 01:53:06,420
superconducting magnets yeah and if in
 

6065
01:53:06,420 --> 01:53:08,629
superconducting magnets yeah and if in
fact if you look at it's like it's if

6066
01:53:08,629 --> 01:53:08,639
fact if you look at it's like it's if
 

6067
01:53:08,639 --> 01:53:11,030
fact if you look at it's like it's if
you just expand the size of it they're

6068
01:53:11,030 --> 01:53:11,040
you just expand the size of it they're
 

6069
01:53:11,040 --> 01:53:13,070
you just expand the size of it they're
like they look almost identical to each

6070
01:53:13,070 --> 01:53:13,080
like they look almost identical to each
 

6071
01:53:13,080 --> 01:53:14,629
like they look almost identical to each
other because it's based on the and

6072
01:53:14,629 --> 01:53:14,639
other because it's based on the and
 

6073
01:53:14,639 --> 01:53:15,950
other because it's based on the and
actually that comes for a Reason by the

6074
01:53:15,950 --> 01:53:15,960
actually that comes for a Reason by the
 

6075
01:53:15,960 --> 01:53:17,750
actually that comes for a Reason by the
way is that it also looks like a bigger

6076
01:53:17,750 --> 01:53:17,760
way is that it also looks like a bigger
 

6077
01:53:17,760 --> 01:53:20,090
way is that it also looks like a bigger
version of the Toca Mac that we ran at

6078
01:53:20,090 --> 01:53:20,100
version of the Toca Mac that we ran at
 

6079
01:53:20,100 --> 01:53:23,270
version of the Toca Mac that we ran at
MIT for 20 years where we established

6080
01:53:23,270 --> 01:53:23,280
MIT for 20 years where we established
 

6081
01:53:23,280 --> 01:53:25,669
MIT for 20 years where we established
the scientific benefits in fact of these

6082
01:53:25,669 --> 01:53:25,679
the scientific benefits in fact of these
 

6083
01:53:25,679 --> 01:53:28,370
the scientific benefits in fact of these
higher magnetic fields so that's the

6084
01:53:28,370 --> 01:53:28,380
higher magnetic fields so that's the
 

6085
01:53:28,380 --> 01:53:30,169
higher magnetic fields so that's the
pathway that runs so always say so what

6086
01:53:30,169 --> 01:53:30,179
pathway that runs so always say so what
 

6087
01:53:30,179 --> 01:53:33,530
pathway that runs so always say so what
does this mean the context is different

6088
01:53:33,530 --> 01:53:33,540
does this mean the context is different
 

6089
01:53:33,540 --> 01:53:35,090
does this mean the context is different
because

6090
01:53:35,090 --> 01:53:35,100
because
 

6091
01:53:35,100 --> 01:53:37,370
because
it was made because it's primarily being

6092
01:53:37,370 --> 01:53:37,380
it was made because it's primarily being
 

6093
01:53:37,380 --> 01:53:40,310
it was made because it's primarily being
made by a a private sector company spun

6094
01:53:40,310 --> 01:53:40,320
made by a a private sector company spun
 

6095
01:53:40,320 --> 01:53:43,250
made by a a private sector company spun
out of MIT because the way that it

6096
01:53:43,250 --> 01:53:43,260
out of MIT because the way that it
 

6097
01:53:43,260 --> 01:53:44,990
out of MIT because the way that it
raised money and the purpose of the

6098
01:53:44,990 --> 01:53:45,000
raised money and the purpose of the
 

6099
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:46,970
raised money and the purpose of the
entity which is there is to make

6100
01:53:46,970 --> 01:53:46,980
entity which is there is to make
 

6101
01:53:46,980 --> 01:53:49,370
entity which is there is to make
commercial fusion power plants not just

6102
01:53:49,370 --> 01:53:49,380
commercial fusion power plants not just
 

6103
01:53:49,380 --> 01:53:51,530
commercial fusion power plants not just
to make a scientific experiment this is

6104
01:53:51,530 --> 01:53:51,540
to make a scientific experiment this is
 

6105
01:53:51,540 --> 01:53:52,970
to make a scientific experiment this is
actually why we have

6106
01:53:52,970 --> 01:53:52,980
actually why we have
 

6107
01:53:52,980 --> 01:53:53,629
actually why we have
um

6108
01:53:53,629 --> 01:53:53,639
um
 

6109
01:53:53,639 --> 01:53:55,490
um
that's why we have a partnership right

6110
01:53:55,490 --> 01:53:55,500
that's why we have a partnership right
 

6111
01:53:55,500 --> 01:53:58,010
that's why we have a partnership right
is that our purpose at MIT is not to

6112
01:53:58,010 --> 01:53:58,020
is that our purpose at MIT is not to
 

6113
01:53:58,020 --> 01:54:00,290
is that our purpose at MIT is not to
commercialize directly but boy do we

6114
01:54:00,290 --> 01:54:00,300
commercialize directly but boy do we
 

6115
01:54:00,300 --> 01:54:01,910
commercialize directly but boy do we
want to advance the technology and the

6116
01:54:01,910 --> 01:54:01,920
want to advance the technology and the
 

6117
01:54:01,920 --> 01:54:03,590
want to advance the technology and the
science that comes along this and that's

6118
01:54:03,590 --> 01:54:03,600
science that comes along this and that's
 

6119
01:54:03,600 --> 01:54:05,149
science that comes along this and that's
the reason we're sort of doing it

6120
01:54:05,149 --> 01:54:05,159
the reason we're sort of doing it
 

6121
01:54:05,159 --> 01:54:06,890
the reason we're sort of doing it
together so it's MIT and Commonwealth

6122
01:54:06,890 --> 01:54:06,900
together so it's MIT and Commonwealth
 

6123
01:54:06,900 --> 01:54:08,629
together so it's MIT and Commonwealth
Fusion systems so what's what's

6124
01:54:08,629 --> 01:54:08,639
Fusion systems so what's what's
 

6125
01:54:08,639 --> 01:54:10,669
Fusion systems so what's what's
interesting to say about financing and

6126
01:54:10,669 --> 01:54:10,679
interesting to say about financing and
 

6127
01:54:10,679 --> 01:54:12,550
interesting to say about financing and
this seems like from a scientific

6128
01:54:12,550 --> 01:54:12,560
this seems like from a scientific
 

6129
01:54:12,560 --> 01:54:14,930
this seems like from a scientific
perspective maybe not an interesting

6130
01:54:14,930 --> 01:54:14,940
perspective maybe not an interesting
 

6131
01:54:14,940 --> 01:54:16,790
perspective maybe not an interesting
topic but it's perhaps an extremely

6132
01:54:16,790 --> 01:54:16,800
topic but it's perhaps an extremely
 

6133
01:54:16,800 --> 01:54:18,470
topic but it's perhaps an extremely
interesting topic I mean you can just

6134
01:54:18,470 --> 01:54:18,480
interesting topic I mean you can just
 

6135
01:54:18,480 --> 01:54:21,109
interesting topic I mean you can just
look at the testing between SpaceX and

6136
01:54:21,109 --> 01:54:21,119
look at the testing between SpaceX and
 

6137
01:54:21,119 --> 01:54:22,970
look at the testing between SpaceX and
NASA for example yes it's just clear

6138
01:54:22,970 --> 01:54:22,980
NASA for example yes it's just clear
 

6139
01:54:22,980 --> 01:54:24,530
NASA for example yes it's just clear
that there's different financing

6140
01:54:24,530 --> 01:54:24,540
that there's different financing
 

6141
01:54:24,540 --> 01:54:26,750
that there's different financing
mechanisms can actually significantly

6142
01:54:26,750 --> 01:54:26,760
mechanisms can actually significantly
 

6143
01:54:26,760 --> 01:54:28,729
mechanisms can actually significantly
accelerate

6144
01:54:28,729 --> 01:54:28,739
accelerate
 

6145
01:54:28,739 --> 01:54:30,890
accelerate
the development of Science and

6146
01:54:30,890 --> 01:54:30,900
the development of Science and
 

6147
01:54:30,900 --> 01:54:31,970
the development of Science and
Engineering

6148
01:54:31,970 --> 01:54:31,980
Engineering
 

6149
01:54:31,980 --> 01:54:33,830
Engineering
it's great that you brought that up we

6150
01:54:33,830 --> 01:54:33,840
it's great that you brought that up we
 

6151
01:54:33,840 --> 01:54:36,649
it's great that you brought that up we
use several historic analogs and one of

6152
01:54:36,649 --> 01:54:36,659
use several historic analogs and one of
 

6153
01:54:36,659 --> 01:54:38,209
use several historic analogs and one of
them is around SpaceX which is an

6154
01:54:38,209 --> 01:54:38,219
them is around SpaceX which is an
 

6155
01:54:38,219 --> 01:54:40,850
them is around SpaceX which is an
appropriate one because space you know

6156
01:54:40,850 --> 01:54:40,860
appropriate one because space you know
 

6157
01:54:40,860 --> 01:54:43,310
appropriate one because space you know
putting things into orbit has a just a

6158
01:54:43,310 --> 01:54:43,320
putting things into orbit has a just a
 

6159
01:54:43,320 --> 01:54:46,310
putting things into orbit has a just a
has a minimum size to it and integrated

6160
01:54:46,310 --> 01:54:46,320
has a minimum size to it and integrated
 

6161
01:54:46,320 --> 01:54:48,950
has a minimum size to it and integrated
technological complexity and budget and

6162
01:54:48,950 --> 01:54:48,960
technological complexity and budget and
 

6163
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:51,950
technological complexity and budget and
things like this so you know our point

6164
01:54:51,950 --> 01:54:51,960
things like this so you know our point
 

6165
01:54:51,960 --> 01:54:53,750
things like this so you know our point
when we were like talking about starting

6166
01:54:53,750 --> 01:54:53,760
when we were like talking about starting
 

6167
01:54:53,760 --> 01:54:55,850
when we were like talking about starting
like a fusion commercialization you know

6168
01:54:55,850 --> 01:54:55,860
like a fusion commercialization you know
 

6169
01:54:55,860 --> 01:54:58,250
like a fusion commercialization you know
company people look at you like like

6170
01:54:58,250 --> 01:54:58,260
company people look at you like like
 

6171
01:54:58,260 --> 01:54:59,750
company people look at you like like
isn't this still really just a science

6172
01:54:59,750 --> 01:54:59,760
isn't this still really just a science
 

6173
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:02,090
isn't this still really just a science
experiment you know but are one of the

6174
01:55:02,090 --> 01:55:02,100
experiment you know but are one of the
 

6175
01:55:02,100 --> 01:55:04,550
experiment you know but are one of the
things that we pointed to was SpaceX to

6176
01:55:04,550 --> 01:55:04,560
things that we pointed to was SpaceX to
 

6177
01:55:04,560 --> 01:55:07,250
things that we pointed to was SpaceX to
say well tell me like 25 years ago how

6178
01:55:07,250 --> 01:55:07,260
say well tell me like 25 years ago how
 

6179
01:55:07,260 --> 01:55:08,750
say well tell me like 25 years ago how
many people would have voted that you

6180
01:55:08,750 --> 01:55:08,760
many people would have voted that you
 

6181
01:55:08,760 --> 01:55:10,790
many people would have voted that you
know the the leading entity on the

6182
01:55:10,790 --> 01:55:10,800
know the the leading entity on the
 

6183
01:55:10,800 --> 01:55:12,410
know the the leading entity on the
planet to put things into orbit it's a

6184
01:55:12,410 --> 01:55:12,420
planet to put things into orbit it's a
 

6185
01:55:12,420 --> 01:55:13,790
planet to put things into orbit it's a
private company people would have

6186
01:55:13,790 --> 01:55:13,800
private company people would have
 

6187
01:55:13,800 --> 01:55:16,430
private company people would have
thought you were not so right it's like

6188
01:55:16,430 --> 01:55:16,440
thought you were not so right it's like
 

6189
01:55:16,440 --> 01:55:19,550
thought you were not so right it's like
and what is interesting about SpaceX was

6190
01:55:19,550 --> 01:55:19,560
and what is interesting about SpaceX was
 

6191
01:55:19,560 --> 01:55:21,649
and what is interesting about SpaceX was
that it proved it's more than actually

6192
01:55:21,649 --> 01:55:21,659
that it proved it's more than actually
 

6193
01:55:21,659 --> 01:55:23,450
that it proved it's more than actually
just financing

6194
01:55:23,450 --> 01:55:23,460
just financing
 

6195
01:55:23,460 --> 01:55:25,370
just financing
it's really the purpose of the

6196
01:55:25,370 --> 01:55:25,380
it's really the purpose of the
 

6197
01:55:25,380 --> 01:55:28,790
it's really the purpose of the
organization so the purpose of a gun and

6198
01:55:28,790 --> 01:55:28,800
organization so the purpose of a gun and
 

6199
01:55:28,800 --> 01:55:30,590
organization so the purpose of a gun and
I'm not against Public Finance or

6200
01:55:30,590 --> 01:55:30,600
I'm not against Public Finance or
 

6201
01:55:30,600 --> 01:55:32,270
I'm not against Public Finance or
anything like that but the purpose of a

6202
01:55:32,270 --> 01:55:32,280
anything like that but the purpose of a
 

6203
01:55:32,280 --> 01:55:35,450
anything like that but the purpose of a
public entity like in like NASA

6204
01:55:35,450 --> 01:55:35,460
public entity like in like NASA
 

6205
01:55:35,460 --> 01:55:37,609
public entity like in like NASA
correctly you know speaks to the

6206
01:55:37,609 --> 01:55:37,619
correctly you know speaks to the
 

6207
01:55:37,619 --> 01:55:38,810
correctly you know speaks to the
political

6208
01:55:38,810 --> 01:55:38,820
political
 

6209
01:55:38,820 --> 01:55:40,970
political
because because the cost comes from the

6210
01:55:40,970 --> 01:55:40,980
because because the cost comes from the
 

6211
01:55:40,980 --> 01:55:44,030
because because the cost comes from the
political you know uh assembly that is

6212
01:55:44,030 --> 01:55:44,040
political you know uh assembly that is
 

6213
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:46,129
political you know uh assembly that is
there and and I guess from us eventually

6214
01:55:46,129 --> 01:55:46,139
there and and I guess from us eventually
 

6215
01:55:46,139 --> 01:55:48,950
there and and I guess from us eventually
as well too but its purpose wasn't about

6216
01:55:48,950 --> 01:55:48,960
as well too but its purpose wasn't about
 

6217
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:52,790
as well too but its purpose wasn't about
like making a commercial product it's

6218
01:55:52,790 --> 01:55:52,800
like making a commercial product it's
 

6219
01:55:52,800 --> 01:55:54,649
like making a commercial product it's
about fundamental Discovery and so forth

6220
01:55:54,649 --> 01:55:54,659
about fundamental Discovery and so forth
 

6221
01:55:54,659 --> 01:55:56,090
about fundamental Discovery and so forth
which is all which is all really great

6222
01:55:56,090 --> 01:55:56,100
which is all which is all really great
 

6223
01:55:56,100 --> 01:55:59,390
which is all which is all really great
it's like why did why did SpaceX it's

6224
01:55:59,390 --> 01:55:59,400
it's like why did why did SpaceX it's
 

6225
01:55:59,400 --> 01:56:00,830
it's like why did why did SpaceX it's
interesting because why did SpaceX

6226
01:56:00,830 --> 01:56:00,840
interesting because why did SpaceX
 

6227
01:56:00,840 --> 01:56:03,830
interesting because why did SpaceX
succeed so well is because the idea was

6228
01:56:03,830 --> 01:56:03,840
succeed so well is because the idea was
 

6229
01:56:03,840 --> 01:56:06,950
succeed so well is because the idea was
it's like the the focus that comes in

6230
01:56:06,950 --> 01:56:06,960
it's like the the focus that comes in
 

6231
01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:08,510
it's like the the focus that comes in
the idea that you're going to

6232
01:56:08,510 --> 01:56:08,520
the idea that you're going to
 

6233
01:56:08,520 --> 01:56:11,629
the idea that you're going to
relentlessly like reduce cost and

6234
01:56:11,629 --> 01:56:11,639
relentlessly like reduce cost and
 

6235
01:56:11,639 --> 01:56:13,970
relentlessly like reduce cost and
increase efficiency is a drive that

6236
01:56:13,970 --> 01:56:13,980
increase efficiency is a drive that
 

6237
01:56:13,980 --> 01:56:16,490
increase efficiency is a drive that
comes from the commercial aspect of it

6238
01:56:16,490 --> 01:56:16,500
comes from the commercial aspect of it
 

6239
01:56:16,500 --> 01:56:19,550
comes from the commercial aspect of it
right and this also then changes

6240
01:56:19,550 --> 01:56:19,560
right and this also then changes
 

6241
01:56:19,560 --> 01:56:21,709
right and this also then changes
um the people in the teams which are

6242
01:56:21,709 --> 01:56:21,719
um the people in the teams which are
 

6243
01:56:21,719 --> 01:56:23,090
um the people in the teams which are
doing it as well too and in fact

6244
01:56:23,090 --> 01:56:23,100
doing it as well too and in fact
 

6245
01:56:23,100 --> 01:56:24,350
doing it as well too and in fact
trickles throughout the whole thing

6246
01:56:24,350 --> 01:56:24,360
trickles throughout the whole thing
 

6247
01:56:24,360 --> 01:56:27,649
trickles throughout the whole thing
because the purpose isn't while you're

6248
01:56:27,649 --> 01:56:27,659
because the purpose isn't while you're
 

6249
01:56:27,659 --> 01:56:29,750
because the purpose isn't while you're
while you're advancing things like it's

6250
01:56:29,750 --> 01:56:29,760
while you're advancing things like it's
 

6251
01:56:29,760 --> 01:56:31,189
while you're advancing things like it's
really good that we can put things in

6252
01:56:31,189 --> 01:56:31,199
really good that we can put things in
 

6253
01:56:31,199 --> 01:56:33,290
really good that we can put things in
orbit a lot less more cheaply like in

6254
01:56:33,290 --> 01:56:33,300
orbit a lot less more cheaply like in
 

6255
01:56:33,300 --> 01:56:34,490
orbit a lot less more cheaply like in
advance of science which is an

6256
01:56:34,490 --> 01:56:34,500
advance of science which is an
 

6257
01:56:34,500 --> 01:56:36,290
advance of science which is an
interesting Synergy right and it's the

6258
01:56:36,290 --> 01:56:36,300
interesting Synergy right and it's the
 

6259
01:56:36,300 --> 01:56:38,209
interesting Synergy right and it's the
same thing that that we think is going

6260
01:56:38,209 --> 01:56:38,219
same thing that that we think is going
 

6261
01:56:38,219 --> 01:56:40,490
same thing that that we think is going
to happen in fuse that namely these this

6262
01:56:40,490 --> 01:56:40,500
to happen in fuse that namely these this
 

6263
01:56:40,500 --> 01:56:43,010
to happen in fuse that namely these this
is a bootstrap effect that actually that

6264
01:56:43,010 --> 01:56:43,020
is a bootstrap effect that actually that
 

6265
01:56:43,020 --> 01:56:45,290
is a bootstrap effect that actually that
when you start to push yourself to think

6266
01:56:45,290 --> 01:56:45,300
when you start to push yourself to think
 

6267
01:56:45,300 --> 01:56:48,169
when you start to push yourself to think
about near-term commercialization it

6268
01:56:48,169 --> 01:56:48,179
about near-term commercialization it
 

6269
01:56:48,179 --> 01:56:51,109
about near-term commercialization it
like allows the size to get in hand

6270
01:56:51,109 --> 01:56:51,119
like allows the size to get in hand
 

6271
01:56:51,119 --> 01:56:52,430
like allows the size to get in hand
faster which then allows the

6272
01:56:52,430 --> 01:56:52,440
faster which then allows the
 

6273
01:56:52,440 --> 01:56:54,470
faster which then allows the
commercialization to go faster into an

6274
01:56:54,470 --> 01:56:54,480
commercialization to go faster into an
 

6275
01:56:54,480 --> 01:56:56,990
commercialization to go faster into an
up we go by the way we've seen this also

6276
01:56:56,990 --> 01:56:57,000
up we go by the way we've seen this also
 

6277
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,149
up we go by the way we've seen this also
in another like again it's a you have to

6278
01:56:59,149 --> 01:56:59,159
in another like again it's a you have to
 

6279
01:56:59,159 --> 01:57:00,830
in another like again it's a you have to
watch out with with analogies because

6280
01:57:00,830 --> 01:57:00,840
watch out with with analogies because
 

6281
01:57:00,840 --> 01:57:03,410
watch out with with analogies because
they only can go so far but like biotech

6282
01:57:03,410 --> 01:57:03,420
they only can go so far but like biotech
 

6283
01:57:03,420 --> 01:57:05,390
they only can go so far but like biotech
is another one like you look at the

6284
01:57:05,390 --> 01:57:05,400
is another one like you look at the
 

6285
01:57:05,400 --> 01:57:07,910
is another one like you look at the
Human Genome Project which was

6286
01:57:07,910 --> 01:57:07,920
Human Genome Project which was
 

6287
01:57:07,920 --> 01:57:10,370
Human Genome Project which was
it's sort of like it's it to me that's

6288
01:57:10,370 --> 01:57:10,380
it's sort of like it's it to me that's
 

6289
01:57:10,380 --> 01:57:12,410
it's sort of like it's it to me that's
like like mapping the human genome is

6290
01:57:12,410 --> 01:57:12,420
like like mapping the human genome is
 

6291
01:57:12,420 --> 01:57:14,510
like like mapping the human genome is
like like that we can make net energy

6292
01:57:14,510 --> 01:57:14,520
like like that we can make net energy
 

6293
01:57:14,520 --> 01:57:17,089
like like that we can make net energy
from Fusion like it's one of those like

6294
01:57:17,089 --> 01:57:17,099
from Fusion like it's one of those like
 

6295
01:57:17,099 --> 01:57:19,790
from Fusion like it's one of those like
in your drawer that you go this is a

6296
01:57:19,790 --> 01:57:19,800
in your drawer that you go this is a
 

6297
01:57:19,800 --> 01:57:21,649
in your drawer that you go this is a
significant achievement by Humanity

6298
01:57:21,649 --> 01:57:21,659
significant achievement by Humanity
 

6299
01:57:21,659 --> 01:57:24,229
significant achievement by Humanity
right in the century and there's the

6300
01:57:24,229 --> 01:57:24,239
right in the century and there's the
 

6301
01:57:24,239 --> 01:57:26,510
right in the century and there's the
Human Genome Project fully government

6302
01:57:26,510 --> 01:57:26,520
Human Genome Project fully government
 

6303
01:57:26,520 --> 01:57:29,510
Human Genome Project fully government
funded it's going to take 20 25 years

6304
01:57:29,510 --> 01:57:29,520
funded it's going to take 20 25 years
 

6305
01:57:29,520 --> 01:57:32,030
funded it's going to take 20 25 years
because we basically know the technology

6306
01:57:32,030 --> 01:57:32,040
because we basically know the technology
 

6307
01:57:32,040 --> 01:57:34,070
because we basically know the technology
we're just going to be really diligent

6308
01:57:34,070 --> 01:57:34,080
we're just going to be really diligent
 

6309
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:36,530
we're just going to be really diligent
keep going and then all of a sudden what

6310
01:57:36,530 --> 01:57:36,540
keep going and then all of a sudden what
 

6311
01:57:36,540 --> 01:57:40,070
keep going and then all of a sudden what
comes along disruptive technology right

6312
01:57:40,070 --> 01:57:40,080
comes along disruptive technology right
 

6313
01:57:40,080 --> 01:57:42,229
comes along disruptive technology right
you can sequence you you know shotgun

6314
01:57:42,229 --> 01:57:42,239
you can sequence you you know shotgun
 

6315
01:57:42,239 --> 01:57:44,689
you can sequence you you know shotgun
sequencing and computer you know

6316

sequencing and computer you know
 

6317
01:57:44,699 --> 01:57:47,089
sequencing and computer you know
recognition patterns and basically oh I

6318
01:57:47,089 --> 01:57:47,099
recognition patterns and basically oh I
 

6319
01:57:47,099 --> 01:57:49,129
recognition patterns and basically oh I
can do this a hundred times faster

6320
01:57:49,129 --> 01:57:49,139
can do this a hundred times faster
 

6321
01:57:49,139 --> 01:57:52,189
can do this a hundred times faster
like wow right and so so that's really

6322
01:57:52,189 --> 01:57:52,199
like wow right and so so that's really
 

6323
01:57:52,199 --> 01:57:55,729
like wow right and so so that's really
the uh you know to me that the story

6324
01:57:55,729 --> 01:57:55,739
the uh you know to me that the story
 

6325
01:57:55,739 --> 01:57:57,649
the uh you know to me that the story
about why we started why we launched

6326
01:57:57,649 --> 01:57:57,659
about why we started why we launched
 

6327
01:57:57,659 --> 01:57:59,450
about why we started why we launched
Commonwealth Fusion systems was more

6328
01:57:59,450 --> 01:57:59,460
Commonwealth Fusion systems was more
 

6329
01:57:59,460 --> 01:58:02,149
Commonwealth Fusion systems was more
than just about another source of

6330
01:58:02,149 --> 01:58:02,159
than just about another source of
 

6331
01:58:02,159 --> 01:58:04,430
than just about another source of
funding which is a different source of

6332
01:58:04,430 --> 01:58:04,440
funding which is a different source of
 

6333
01:58:04,440 --> 01:58:05,930
funding which is a different source of
fun because it comes it's also a

6334
01:58:05,930 --> 01:58:05,940
fun because it comes it's also a
 

6335
01:58:05,940 --> 01:58:07,550
fun because it comes it's also a
different purpose which is very

6336
01:58:07,550 --> 01:58:07,560
different purpose which is very
 

6337
01:58:07,560 --> 01:58:09,109
different purpose which is very
important but there's also something

6338
01:58:09,109 --> 01:58:09,119
important but there's also something
 

6339
01:58:09,119 --> 01:58:12,649
important but there's also something
about a mechanism that creates culture

6340
01:58:12,649 --> 01:58:12,659
about a mechanism that creates culture
 

6341
01:58:12,659 --> 01:58:16,010
about a mechanism that creates culture
so giving power to like a young student

6342
01:58:16,010 --> 01:58:16,020
so giving power to like a young student
 

6343

creates a culture that actually makes

6348
01:58:23,209 --> 01:58:23,219
creates a culture that actually makes
 

6349
01:58:23,219 --> 01:58:25,550
creates a culture that actually makes
progress more aggressively like like you

6350
01:58:25,550 --> 01:58:25,560
progress more aggressively like like you

gives more incentive to the bureaucracy

6354
01:58:29,870 --> 01:58:29,880
gives more incentive to the bureaucracy

let's have first have a discussion and
 

6359
01:58:33,960 --> 01:58:35,629
let's have first have a discussion and
certainly don't give voice to the young

ambitious Minds that are really pushing
 

6363
01:58:37,980 --> 01:58:39,530
ambitious Minds that are really pushing
stuff forward yeah and there's something

6364
01:58:39,530 --> 01:58:39,540
stuff forward yeah and there's something
 

6365
01:58:39,540 --> 01:58:42,910
stuff forward yeah and there's something
about like the private sector that

6366
01:58:42,910 --> 01:58:42,920
about like the private sector that
 

6367
01:58:42,920 --> 01:58:46,910
about like the private sector that

simpler we'll make it better we'll make
 

6379
01:58:57,540 --> 01:58:59,330
simpler we'll make it better we'll make
it cheaper yeah and sometimes that

6380
01:58:59,330 --> 01:58:59,340
it cheaper yeah and sometimes that

6383
01:59:01,320 --> 01:59:02,990
brashness doesn't bear out you know
that's an aspect that you just take a

6384
01:59:02,990 --> 01:59:03,000
that's an aspect that you just take a
 

6385
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:04,790
that's an aspect that you just take a
different risk profile as well too but

6386
01:59:04,790 --> 01:59:04,800
different risk profile as well too but
 

6387
01:59:04,800 --> 01:59:07,490
different risk profile as well too but
you're right it's this you know of them

6388
01:59:07,490 --> 01:59:07,500
you're right it's this you know of them
 

6389
01:59:07,500 --> 01:59:09,770
you're right it's this you know of them
I mean it was interesting our our own

6390
01:59:09,770 --> 01:59:09,780
I mean it was interesting our our own
 

6391
01:59:09,780 --> 01:59:11,570
I mean it was interesting our our own
trajectory at the at the fusion Center

6392
01:59:11,570 --> 01:59:11,580
trajectory at the at the fusion Center
 

6393
01:59:11,580 --> 01:59:14,450
trajectory at the at the fusion Center
was like we were pushed into this place

6394
01:59:14,450 --> 01:59:14,460
was like we were pushed into this place
 

6395
01:59:14,460 --> 01:59:17,510
was like we were pushed into this place
by necessity as well too because I told

6396
01:59:17,510 --> 01:59:17,520
by necessity as well too because I told
 

6397
01:59:17,520 --> 01:59:19,490
by necessity as well too because I told
you we have and we had operated for a

6398
01:59:19,490 --> 01:59:19,500
you we have and we had operated for a
 

6399
01:59:19,500 --> 01:59:22,850
you we have and we had operated for a
long time a Tokamak at uh on the MIT

6400
01:59:22,850 --> 01:59:22,860
long time a Tokamak at uh on the MIT
 

6401
01:59:22,860 --> 01:59:24,950
long time a Tokamak at uh on the MIT
campus achieve these World Records like

6402
01:59:24,950 --> 01:59:24,960
campus achieve these World Records like
 

6403
01:59:24,960 --> 01:59:26,990
campus achieve these World Records like
100 million degree plasma and so I was

6404
01:59:26,990 --> 01:59:27,000
100 million degree plasma and so I was
 

6405
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:30,109
100 million degree plasma and so I was
like wow this is fantastic but

6406
01:59:30,109 --> 01:59:30,119
like wow this is fantastic but
 

6407
01:59:30,119 --> 01:59:32,209
like wow this is fantastic but
you know somewhat ironically I have to

6408
01:59:32,209 --> 01:59:32,219
you know somewhat ironically I have to
 

6409
01:59:32,219 --> 01:59:34,490
you know somewhat ironically I have to
say is that it was like oh but we're not

6410
01:59:34,490 --> 01:59:34,500
say is that it was like oh but we're not
 

6411
01:59:34,500 --> 01:59:36,410
say is that it was like oh but we're not
this isn't the future of fusion anymore

6412
01:59:36,410 --> 01:59:36,420
this isn't the future of fusion anymore
 

6413
01:59:36,420 --> 01:59:38,030
this isn't the future of fusion anymore
like we're not we're just gonna stop

6414
01:59:38,030 --> 01:59:38,040
like we're not we're just gonna stop
 

6415
01:59:38,040 --> 01:59:39,709
like we're not we're just gonna stop
with small projects because it's too

6416
01:59:39,709 --> 01:59:39,719
with small projects because it's too
 

6417
01:59:39,719 --> 01:59:41,810
with small projects because it's too
small right so we should need we need to

6418
01:59:41,810 --> 01:59:41,820
small right so we should need we need to
 

6419
01:59:41,820 --> 01:59:43,370
small right so we should need we need to
really move on to these much bigger

6420
01:59:43,370 --> 01:59:43,380
really move on to these much bigger
 

6421
01:59:43,380 --> 01:59:44,689
really move on to these much bigger
projects because that's really the

6422
01:59:44,689 --> 01:59:44,699
projects because that's really the
 

6423
01:59:44,699 --> 01:59:48,050
projects because that's really the
future of fusion and so it was defunded

6424
01:59:48,050 --> 01:59:48,060
future of fusion and so it was defunded
 

6425
01:59:48,060 --> 01:59:50,089
future of fusion and so it was defunded
um and this basically put at risk like

6426
01:59:50,089 --> 01:59:50,099
um and this basically put at risk like
 

6427
01:59:50,099 --> 01:59:51,950
um and this basically put at risk like
like we were going to essentially lose

6428
01:59:51,950 --> 01:59:51,960
like we were going to essentially lose
 

6429
01:59:51,960 --> 01:59:55,010
like we were going to essentially lose
MIT in the ecosystem really a fusion

6430
01:59:55,010 --> 01:59:55,020
MIT in the ecosystem really a fusion
 

6431
01:59:55,020 --> 01:59:57,649
MIT in the ecosystem really a fusion
both from the research but also clearly

6432
01:59:57,649 --> 01:59:57,659
both from the research but also clearly
 

6433
01:59:57,659 --> 01:59:59,930
both from the research but also clearly
important from the educational part of

6434
01:59:59,930 --> 01:59:59,940
important from the educational part of
 

6435
01:59:59,940 --> 02:00:02,450
important from the educational part of
it so we you know we push back against

6436
02:00:02,450 --> 02:00:02,460
it so we you know we push back against
 

6437
02:00:02,460 --> 02:00:05,030
it so we you know we push back against
this we got a Lifeline we were able to

6438
02:00:05,030 --> 02:00:05,040
this we got a Lifeline we were able to
 

6439
02:00:05,040 --> 02:00:06,770
this we got a Lifeline we were able to
go it was in this it was in this time

6440
02:00:06,770 --> 02:00:06,780
go it was in this it was in this time
 

6441
02:00:06,780 --> 02:00:08,930
go it was in this it was in this time
scale that we basically came up with

6442
02:00:08,930 --> 02:00:08,940
scale that we basically came up with
 

6443
02:00:08,940 --> 02:00:10,729
scale that we basically came up with
this idea it's like we should do this

6444
02:00:10,729 --> 02:00:10,739
this idea it's like we should do this
 

6445
02:00:10,739 --> 02:00:14,510
this idea it's like we should do this
and in the end it was all of those the

6446
02:00:14,510 --> 02:00:14,520
and in the end it was all of those the
 

6447
02:00:14,520 --> 02:00:16,550
and in the end it was all of those the
the people who were in the sea level of

6448
02:00:16,550 --> 02:00:16,560
the people who were in the sea level of
 

6449
02:00:16,560 --> 02:00:18,589
the people who were in the sea level of
the company were all literally students

6450
02:00:18,589 --> 02:00:18,599
the company were all literally students
 

6451
02:00:18,599 --> 02:00:20,629
the company were all literally students
who got caught in that they were PhD

6452
02:00:20,629 --> 02:00:20,639
who got caught in that they were PhD
 

6453
02:00:20,639 --> 02:00:22,550
who got caught in that they were PhD
students at the time so you talk about

6454
02:00:22,550 --> 02:00:22,560
students at the time so you talk about
 

6455
02:00:22,560 --> 02:00:25,310
students at the time so you talk about
enabling another generation it's like

6456
02:00:25,310 --> 02:00:25,320
enabling another generation it's like
 

6457
02:00:25,320 --> 02:00:29,570
enabling another generation it's like
yeah there you go right so spark gave a

6458
02:00:29,570 --> 02:00:29,580
yeah there you go right so spark gave a
 

6459
02:00:29,580 --> 02:00:33,430
yeah there you go right so spark gave a
lifeline

6460
02:00:33,430 --> 02:00:33,440

 

6461
02:00:33,440 --> 02:00:35,930

but it's way more than that it was it

6462
02:00:35,930 --> 02:00:35,940
but it's way more than that it was it
 

6463
02:00:35,940 --> 02:00:38,149
but it's way more than that it was it
wasn't just about like surviving for the

6464
02:00:38,149 --> 02:00:38,159
wasn't just about like surviving for the
 

6465
02:00:38,159 --> 02:00:40,430
wasn't just about like surviving for the
sake of surviving it was like in the end

6466
02:00:40,430 --> 02:00:40,440
sake of surviving it was like in the end
 

6467
02:00:40,440 --> 02:00:42,649
sake of surviving it was like in the end
for me it became like this I remember

6468
02:00:42,649 --> 02:00:42,659
for me it became like this I remember
 

6469
02:00:42,659 --> 02:00:44,089
for me it became like this I remember
the moment when you talk about these

6470
02:00:44,089 --> 02:00:44,099
the moment when you talk about these
 

6471
02:00:44,099 --> 02:00:46,370
the moment when you talk about these
moments as a scientist and we were just

6472
02:00:46,370 --> 02:00:46,380
moments as a scientist and we were just
 

6473
02:00:46,380 --> 02:00:48,109
moments as a scientist and we were just
like we were working so hard about

6474
02:00:48,109 --> 02:00:48,119
like we were working so hard about
 

6475
02:00:48,119 --> 02:00:49,550
like we were working so hard about
figuring out like does this really would

6476
02:00:49,550 --> 02:00:49,560
figuring out like does this really would
 

6477
02:00:49,560 --> 02:00:51,470
figuring out like does this really would
this really work like in this it's

6478
02:00:51,470 --> 02:00:51,480
this really work like in this it's
 

6479
02:00:51,480 --> 02:00:53,750
this really work like in this it's
complex like does the magnet work does

6480
02:00:53,750 --> 02:00:53,760
complex like does the magnet work does
 

6481
02:00:53,760 --> 02:00:55,189
complex like does the magnet work does
the interaction with the plasma work

6482
02:00:55,189 --> 02:00:55,199
the interaction with the plasma work
 

6483
02:00:55,199 --> 02:00:56,750
the interaction with the plasma work
does all these things work and it was

6484
02:00:56,750 --> 02:00:56,760
does all these things work and it was
 

6485
02:00:56,760 --> 02:00:59,510
does all these things work and it was
just a grind push push push push and I

6486
02:00:59,510 --> 02:00:59,520
just a grind push push push push and I
 

6487
02:00:59,520 --> 02:01:00,890
just a grind push push push push and I
remember the moment because I was

6488
02:01:00,890 --> 02:01:00,900
remember the moment because I was
 

6489
02:01:00,900 --> 02:01:01,850
remember the moment because I was
sitting

6490
02:01:01,850 --> 02:01:01,860
sitting
 

6491
02:01:01,860 --> 02:01:04,729
sitting
in my office in Brookline and and and

6492
02:01:04,729 --> 02:01:04,739
in my office in Brookline and and and
 

6493
02:01:04,739 --> 02:01:06,649
in my office in Brookline and and and
and there was just like I read like and

6494
02:01:06,649 --> 02:01:06,659
and there was just like I read like and
 

6495
02:01:06,659 --> 02:01:08,870
and there was just like I read like and
I was in I don't know whatever the 20 or

6496
02:01:08,870 --> 02:01:08,880
I was in I don't know whatever the 20 or
 

6497
02:01:08,880 --> 02:01:11,450
I was in I don't know whatever the 20 or
40th slide or something into it and it

6498
02:01:11,450 --> 02:01:11,460
40th slide or something into it and it
 

6499
02:01:11,460 --> 02:01:12,830
40th slide or something into it and it
was sort of that moment like it just

6500
02:01:12,830 --> 02:01:12,840
was sort of that moment like it just
 

6501
02:01:12,840 --> 02:01:15,169
was sort of that moment like it just
came together and I like I I got I

6502
02:01:15,169 --> 02:01:15,179
came together and I like I I got I
 

6503
02:01:15,179 --> 02:01:17,089
came together and I like I I got I
couldn't even sit down because all I was

6504
02:01:17,089 --> 02:01:17,099
couldn't even sit down because all I was
 

6505
02:01:17,099 --> 02:01:18,530
couldn't even sit down because all I was
just like my wife was like why are you

6506
02:01:18,530 --> 02:01:18,540
just like my wife was like why are you
 

6507
02:01:18,540 --> 02:01:19,970
just like my wife was like why are you
walking around the apartment like this

6508
02:01:19,970 --> 02:01:19,980
walking around the apartment like this
 

6509
02:01:19,980 --> 02:01:21,350
walking around the apartment like this
like I just couldn't she I said it's

6510
02:01:21,350 --> 02:01:21,360
like I just couldn't she I said it's
 

6511
02:01:21,360 --> 02:01:23,450
like I just couldn't she I said it's
going to work like it's going to work

6512
02:01:23,450 --> 02:01:23,460
going to work like it's going to work
 

6513
02:01:23,460 --> 02:01:26,810
going to work like it's going to work
like holy that moment of realization is

6514
02:01:26,810 --> 02:01:26,820
like holy that moment of realization is
 

6515
02:01:26,820 --> 02:01:29,089
like holy that moment of realization is
like kind of amazing but it also brings

6516
02:01:29,089 --> 02:01:29,099
like kind of amazing but it also brings
 

6517
02:01:29,099 --> 02:01:31,669
like kind of amazing but it also brings
the responsibility of making it work as

6518
02:01:31,669 --> 02:01:31,679
the responsibility of making it work as
 

6519
02:01:31,679 --> 02:01:34,030
the responsibility of making it work as
well so you mean like that magic

6520
02:01:34,030 --> 02:01:34,040
well so you mean like that magic
 

6521
02:01:34,040 --> 02:01:36,709
well so you mean like that magic
realization that you could have this uh

6522
02:01:36,709 --> 02:01:36,719
realization that you could have this uh
 

6523
02:01:36,719 --> 02:01:39,470
realization that you could have this uh
this modern uh Magnum technology and you

6524
02:01:39,470 --> 02:01:39,480
this modern uh Magnum technology and you
 

6525
02:01:39,480 --> 02:01:41,510
this modern uh Magnum technology and you
can actually like why do we need to work

6526
02:01:41,510 --> 02:01:41,520
can actually like why do we need to work
 

6527
02:01:41,520 --> 02:01:43,370
can actually like why do we need to work
with either we can do it here yeah yeah

6528
02:01:43,370 --> 02:01:43,380
with either we can do it here yeah yeah
 

6529
02:01:43,380 --> 02:01:46,669
with either we can do it here yeah yeah
but it's interesting that eater is

6530
02:01:46,669 --> 02:01:46,679
but it's interesting that eater is
 

6531
02:01:46,679 --> 02:01:49,070
but it's interesting that eater is
um that one one of one of the reasons

6532
02:01:49,070 --> 02:01:49,080
um that one one of one of the reasons
 

6533
02:01:49,080 --> 02:01:50,870
um that one one of one of the reasons
that like that we started with a group

6534
02:01:50,870 --> 02:01:50,880
that like that we started with a group
 

6535
02:01:50,880 --> 02:01:53,390
that like that we started with a group
of six of us at MIT and then it's once

6536
02:01:53,390 --> 02:01:53,400
of six of us at MIT and then it's once
 

6537
02:01:53,400 --> 02:01:55,070
of six of us at MIT and then it's once
we got some funding through the through

6538
02:01:55,070 --> 02:01:55,080
we got some funding through the through
 

6539
02:01:55,080 --> 02:01:56,629
we got some funding through the through
the establishment of the company it

6540
02:01:56,629 --> 02:01:56,639
the establishment of the company it
 

6541
02:01:56,639 --> 02:01:58,669
the establishment of the company it
became a slightly larger but in the end

6542
02:01:58,669 --> 02:01:58,679
became a slightly larger but in the end
 

6543
02:01:58,679 --> 02:02:01,430
became a slightly larger but in the end
we had a rather small team like this was

6544
02:02:01,430 --> 02:02:01,440
we had a rather small team like this was
 

6545
02:02:01,440 --> 02:02:04,129
we had a rather small team like this was
like a a team of order of like 20 to 25

6546
02:02:04,129 --> 02:02:04,139
like a a team of order of like 20 to 25
 

6547
02:02:04,139 --> 02:02:07,189
like a a team of order of like 20 to 25
people design spark and like a like

6548
02:02:07,189 --> 02:02:07,199
people design spark and like a like
 

6549
02:02:07,199 --> 02:02:09,589
people design spark and like a like
about two years right how does that

6550
02:02:09,589 --> 02:02:09,599
about two years right how does that
 

6551
02:02:09,599 --> 02:02:12,169
about two years right how does that
happen well we're clever but you have to

6552
02:02:12,169 --> 02:02:12,179
happen well we're clever but you have to
 

6553
02:02:12,179 --> 02:02:14,149
happen well we're clever but you have to
give eater it's due here as well too

6554

the underlying basis that came from

6564
02:02:26,089 --> 02:02:26,099
the underlying basis that came from
 

6565
02:02:26,099 --> 02:02:28,430
the underlying basis that came from
setting that up it had to be there it

6566
02:02:28,430 --> 02:02:28,440
setting that up it had to be there it
 

6567
02:02:28,440 --> 02:02:30,109
setting that up it had to be there it
had to be curiosity driven public

6568
02:02:30,109 --> 02:02:30,119
had to be curiosity driven public
 

6569
02:02:30,119 --> 02:02:32,450
had to be curiosity driven public
program is the same with either but we

6570
02:02:32,450 --> 02:02:32,460
program is the same with either but we
 

6571
02:02:32,460 --> 02:02:34,729
program is the same with either but we
because we had the tools that were there

6572
02:02:34,729 --> 02:02:34,739
because we had the tools that were there
 

6573
02:02:34,739 --> 02:02:36,290
because we had the tools that were there
to understand either we also have the

6574
02:02:36,290 --> 02:02:36,300
to understand either we also have the
 

6575
02:02:36,300 --> 02:02:38,450
to understand either we also have the
tools to understand spark so we we

6576
02:02:38,450 --> 02:02:38,460
tools to understand spark so we we
 

6577
02:02:38,460 --> 02:02:40,729
tools to understand spark so we we
parlayed those in an extremely powerful

6578
02:02:40,729 --> 02:02:40,739
parlayed those in an extremely powerful
 

6579
02:02:40,739 --> 02:02:42,770
parlayed those in an extremely powerful
way to be able to tell us about what was

6580
02:02:42,770 --> 02:02:42,780
way to be able to tell us about what was
 

6581
02:02:42,780 --> 02:02:44,450
way to be able to tell us about what was
going to happen so these things are

6582
02:02:44,450 --> 02:02:44,460
going to happen so these things are
 

6583
02:02:44,460 --> 02:02:46,070
going to happen so these things are
never simple right it's like people look

6584
02:02:46,070 --> 02:02:46,080
never simple right it's like people look
 

6585
02:02:46,080 --> 02:02:48,109

at this go oh this means we should like

6586
02:02:48,109 --> 02:02:48,119
at this go oh this means we should like
 

6587
02:02:48,119 --> 02:02:49,669
at this go oh this means we should like
should we really have a public-based

6588
02:02:49,669 --> 02:02:49,679
should we really have a public-based
 

6589
02:02:49,679 --> 02:02:51,290
should we really have a public-based
program about Fusion or should we have

6590
02:02:51,290 --> 02:02:51,300
program about Fusion or should we have
 

6591
02:02:51,300 --> 02:02:53,330
program about Fusion or should we have
it all in the private it's like no no

6592
02:02:53,330 --> 02:02:53,340
it all in the private it's like no no
 

6593
02:02:53,340 --> 02:02:55,189
it all in the private it's like no no
the answer is neither way because in all

6594
02:02:55,189 --> 02:02:55,199
the answer is neither way because in all
 

6595
02:02:55,199 --> 02:02:57,109
the answer is neither way because in all
these complex Technologies you have to

6596
02:02:57,109 --> 02:02:57,119
these complex Technologies you have to
 

6597
02:02:57,119 --> 02:02:58,609
these complex Technologies you have to
keep pushing on all the fronts to

6598
02:02:58,609 --> 02:02:58,619
keep pushing on all the fronts to
 

6599
02:02:58,619 --> 02:02:59,990
keep pushing on all the fronts to
actually get it there

6600
02:02:59,990 --> 02:03:00,000
actually get it there
 

6601
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,030
actually get it there
so you know the natural question when

6602
02:03:02,030 --> 02:03:02,040
so you know the natural question when
 

6603
02:03:02,040 --> 02:03:04,189
so you know the natural question when
people hear breakthrough with the with

6604
02:03:04,189 --> 02:03:04,199
people hear breakthrough with the with
 

6605
02:03:04,199 --> 02:03:05,510
people hear breakthrough with the with
the inertial confinement with the

6606

the inertial confinement with the
 

6607
02:03:05,520 --> 02:03:07,910
the inertial confinement with the
magnetic confinement is so when will we

6608
02:03:07,910 --> 02:03:07,920
magnetic confinement is so when will we
 

6609
02:03:07,920 --> 02:03:09,950
magnetic confinement is so when will we
have commercial yeah

6610
02:03:09,950 --> 02:03:09,960
have commercial yeah
 

6611
02:03:09,960 --> 02:03:11,930

but it's so disruptive that it's like

6712
02:05:00,589 --> 02:05:00,599
but it's so disruptive that it's like
 

6713
02:05:00,599 --> 02:05:02,629
but it's so disruptive that it's like
there's there's a essentially a class of

6714
02:05:02,629 --> 02:05:02,639
there's there's a essentially a class of
 

6715
02:05:02,639 --> 02:05:04,970
there's there's a essentially a class of
investors and teams that are ready to go

6716
02:05:04,970 --> 02:05:04,980
investors and teams that are ready to go
 

6717
02:05:04,980 --> 02:05:07,070
investors and teams that are ready to go
after it as well too so what do they

6718
02:05:07,070 --> 02:05:07,080
after it as well too so what do they
 

6719
02:05:07,080 --> 02:05:10,550
after it as well too so what do they
share in this they typically share

6720
02:05:10,550 --> 02:05:10,560
share in this they typically share
 

6721
02:05:10,560 --> 02:05:12,530
share in this they typically share
um getting after Fusion on a time scale

6722
02:05:12,530 --> 02:05:12,540
um getting after Fusion on a time scale
 

6723
02:05:12,540 --> 02:05:14,750
um getting after Fusion on a time scale
so that could it have any relevance

6724
02:05:14,750 --> 02:05:14,760
so that could it have any relevance
 

6725
02:05:14,760 --> 02:05:17,209
so that could it have any relevance
towards climate change baling climate

6726
02:05:17,209 --> 02:05:17,219
towards climate change baling climate
 

6727
02:05:17,219 --> 02:05:20,089
towards climate change baling climate
change and I would say this is difficult

6728
02:05:20,089 --> 02:05:20,099
change and I would say this is difficult
 

6729
02:05:20,099 --> 02:05:22,250
change and I would say this is difficult
but it's it's fairly easy because it's

6730
02:05:22,250 --> 02:05:22,260
but it's it's fairly easy because it's
 

6731
02:05:22,260 --> 02:05:23,810
but it's it's fairly easy because it's
math so what you do is you actually go

6732
02:05:23,810 --> 02:05:23,820
math so what you do is you actually go
 

6733
02:05:23,820 --> 02:05:26,030
math so what you do is you actually go
to some Target like 20 50 or 2060

6734
02:05:26,030 --> 02:05:26,040
to some Target like 20 50 or 2060
 

6735
02:05:26,040 --> 02:05:28,250
to some Target like 20 50 or 2060
something like this and say I want to be

6736
02:05:28,250 --> 02:05:28,260
something like this and say I want to be
 

6737
02:05:28,260 --> 02:05:30,530
something like this and say I want to be
blank percent of the the world's market

6738
02:05:30,530 --> 02:05:30,540
blank percent of the the world's market
 

6739
02:05:30,540 --> 02:05:31,790
blank percent of the the world's market
of electricity or something like that

6740
02:05:31,790 --> 02:05:31,800
of electricity or something like that
 

6741
02:05:31,800 --> 02:05:34,490
of electricity or something like that
and you and we know historically what it

6742
02:05:34,490 --> 02:05:34,500
and you and we know historically what it
 

6743
02:05:34,500 --> 02:05:37,370
and you and we know historically what it
takes to evolve and distribute these

6744
02:05:37,370 --> 02:05:37,380
takes to evolve and distribute these
 

6745
02:05:37,380 --> 02:05:38,810
takes to evolve and distribute these
kinds of Technologies because every

6746
02:05:38,810 --> 02:05:38,820
kinds of Technologies because every
 

6747
02:05:38,820 --> 02:05:40,729
kinds of Technologies because every
technology takes some period of time

6748
02:05:40,729 --> 02:05:40,739
technology takes some period of time
 

6749
02:05:40,739 --> 02:05:42,530
technology takes some period of time
so-called s-curve it's basically

6750
02:05:42,530 --> 02:05:42,540
so-called s-curve it's basically
 

6751
02:05:42,540 --> 02:05:44,830
so-called s-curve it's basically
everything follows a logarithmic

6752
02:05:44,830 --> 02:05:44,840
everything follows a logarithmic
 

6753
02:05:44,840 --> 02:05:46,850
everything follows a logarithmic
exponential type curve it's a straight

6754
02:05:46,850 --> 02:05:46,860
exponential type curve it's a straight
 

6755
02:05:46,860 --> 02:05:49,609
exponential type curve it's a straight
line a log plot and um like you look at

6756
02:05:49,609 --> 02:05:49,619
line a log plot and um like you look at
 

6757
02:05:49,619 --> 02:05:52,370
line a log plot and um like you look at
winds solar fission they all follow the

6758
02:05:52,370 --> 02:05:52,380
winds solar fission they all follow the
 

6759
02:05:52,380 --> 02:05:53,870
winds solar fission they all follow the
same thing so it's easy you take that

6760
02:05:53,870 --> 02:05:53,880
same thing so it's easy you take that
 

6761
02:05:53,880 --> 02:05:55,970
same thing so it's easy you take that
curve and you go that slope and you work

6762
02:05:55,970 --> 02:05:55,980
curve and you go that slope and you work
 

6763
02:05:55,980 --> 02:05:57,830
curve and you go that slope and you work
backwards and you go if you don't start

6764
02:05:57,830 --> 02:05:57,840
backwards and you go if you don't start
 

6765
02:05:57,840 --> 02:06:00,169
backwards and you go if you don't start
in the early 2030s like

6766
02:06:00,169 --> 02:06:00,179
in the early 2030s like
 

6767
02:06:00,179 --> 02:06:02,270
in the early 2030s like
it's not going to have uh you know it's

6768
02:06:02,270 --> 02:06:02,280
it's not going to have uh you know it's
 

6769
02:06:02,280 --> 02:06:03,649
it's not going to have uh you know it's
not going to have a significant impact

6770
02:06:03,649 --> 02:06:03,659
not going to have a significant impact
 

6771
02:06:03,659 --> 02:06:06,709
not going to have a significant impact
by that time so all of them share this

6772
02:06:06,709 --> 02:06:06,719
by that time so all of them share this
 

6773
02:06:06,719 --> 02:06:08,330
by that time so all of them share this
idea and in fact it's not just the

6774
02:06:08,330 --> 02:06:08,340
idea and in fact it's not just the
 

6775
02:06:08,340 --> 02:06:10,430
idea and in fact it's not just the
companies now the U.S federal government

6776
02:06:10,430 --> 02:06:10,440
companies now the U.S federal government
 

6777
02:06:10,440 --> 02:06:13,310
companies now the U.S federal government
has a program that was started last year

6778
02:06:13,310 --> 02:06:13,320
has a program that was started last year
 

6779
02:06:13,320 --> 02:06:16,070
has a program that was started last year
that said we should be looking to try to

6780
02:06:16,070 --> 02:06:16,080
that said we should be looking to try to
 

6781
02:06:16,080 --> 02:06:17,750
that said we should be looking to try to
get like the first and what I mean by

6782
02:06:17,750 --> 02:06:17,760
get like the first and what I mean by
 

6783
02:06:17,760 --> 02:06:19,310
get like the first and what I mean by
like what does it mean to start that

6784
02:06:19,310 --> 02:06:19,320
like what does it mean to start that
 

6785
02:06:19,320 --> 02:06:20,629
like what does it mean to start that
you've got something that's putting

6786
02:06:20,629 --> 02:06:20,639
you've got something that's putting
 

6787
02:06:20,639 --> 02:06:22,850
you've got something that's putting
electricity on the grid a pilot what we

6788
02:06:22,850 --> 02:06:22,860
electricity on the grid a pilot what we
 

6789
02:06:22,860 --> 02:06:25,729
electricity on the grid a pilot what we
call it and if that can get started like

6790
02:06:25,729 --> 02:06:25,739
call it and if that can get started like
 

6791
02:06:25,739 --> 02:06:28,669
call it and if that can get started like
in the early 2030s you know the idea of

6792
02:06:28,669 --> 02:06:28,679
in the early 2030s you know the idea of
 

6793
02:06:28,679 --> 02:06:30,169
in the early 2030s you know the idea of
ramping it up you know makes sense

6794
02:06:30,169 --> 02:06:30,179
ramping it up you know makes sense
 

6795
02:06:30,179 --> 02:06:33,649
ramping it up you know makes sense
that's math right so that's the ambition

6796
02:06:33,649 --> 02:06:33,659
that's math right so that's the ambition
 

6797
02:06:33,659 --> 02:06:35,570
that's math right so that's the ambition
then the question is and and actually

6798
02:06:35,570 --> 02:06:35,580
then the question is and and actually
 

6799
02:06:35,580 --> 02:06:37,070
then the question is and and actually
this is different because the government

6800
02:06:37,070 --> 02:06:37,080
this is different because the government
 

6801
02:06:37,080 --> 02:06:39,770
this is different because the government
program and that they vary around in

6802
02:06:39,770 --> 02:06:39,780
program and that they vary around in
 

6803
02:06:39,780 --> 02:06:41,390
program and that they vary around in
this so for for example the United

6804
02:06:41,390 --> 02:06:41,400
this so for for example the United
 

6805
02:06:41,400 --> 02:06:43,430
this so for for example the United
Kingdom's government idea was to get the

6806
02:06:43,430 --> 02:06:43,440
Kingdom's government idea was to get the
 

6807
02:06:43,440 --> 02:06:45,350
Kingdom's government idea was to get the
first one on by 2040.

6808
02:06:45,350 --> 02:06:45,360
first one on by 2040.
 

6809
02:06:45,360 --> 02:06:48,910
first one on by 2040.
and China has Ambitions probably middle

6810
02:06:48,910 --> 02:06:48,920
and China has Ambitions probably middle
 

6811
02:06:48,920 --> 02:06:52,669
and China has Ambitions probably middle
2030s uh or maybe a little bit later and

6812
02:06:52,669 --> 02:06:52,679
2030s uh or maybe a little bit later and
 

6813
02:06:52,679 --> 02:06:55,790
2030s uh or maybe a little bit later and
Europe uh you know Continental Europe is

6814
02:06:55,790 --> 02:06:55,800
Europe uh you know Continental Europe is
 

6815
02:06:55,800 --> 02:06:57,830
Europe uh you know Continental Europe is
it's a little bit I'm not exactly sure

6816
02:06:57,830 --> 02:06:57,840
it's a little bit I'm not exactly sure
 

6817
02:06:57,840 --> 02:06:59,089
it's a little bit I'm not exactly sure
where it is but it's like later it's

6818
02:06:59,089 --> 02:06:59,099
where it is but it's like later it's
 

6819
02:06:59,099 --> 02:07:01,370
where it is but it's like later it's
like 2050 or 2060 because it's mostly

6820
02:07:01,370 --> 02:07:01,380
like 2050 or 2060 because it's mostly
 

6821
02:07:01,380 --> 02:07:04,370
like 2050 or 2060 because it's mostly
linked to the eater timeline as well too

6822
02:07:04,370 --> 02:07:04,380
linked to the eater timeline as well too
 

6823
02:07:04,380 --> 02:07:06,530
linked to the eater timeline as well too
um the fusion companies which makes

6824
02:07:06,530 --> 02:07:06,540
um the fusion companies which makes
 

6825
02:07:06,540 --> 02:07:07,850
um the fusion companies which makes
sense it's like of course they've got

6826
02:07:07,850 --> 02:07:07,860
sense it's like of course they've got
 

6827
02:07:07,860 --> 02:07:09,410
sense it's like of course they've got
the most aggressive timelines it's like

6828
02:07:09,410 --> 02:07:09,420
the most aggressive timelines it's like
 

6829
02:07:09,420 --> 02:07:10,550
the most aggressive timelines it's like
we're going to map the human genome

6830
02:07:10,550 --> 02:07:10,560
we're going to map the human genome
 

6831
02:07:10,560 --> 02:07:12,770
we're going to map the human genome
faster as well too right so it's

6832
02:07:12,770 --> 02:07:12,780
faster as well too right so it's
 

6833
02:07:12,780 --> 02:07:15,109
faster as well too right so it's
interesting about where we are and I

6834
02:07:15,109 --> 02:07:15,119
interesting about where we are and I
 

6835
02:07:15,119 --> 02:07:17,689
interesting about where we are and I
think you know my we're not all the way

6836
02:07:17,689 --> 02:07:17,699
think you know my we're not all the way
 

6837
02:07:17,699 --> 02:07:19,729
think you know my we're not all the way
there but my intuition tells me we're

6838
02:07:19,729 --> 02:07:19,739
there but my intuition tells me we're
 

6839
02:07:19,739 --> 02:07:20,930
there but my intuition tells me we're
probably going to have a couple of

6840
02:07:20,930 --> 02:07:20,940
probably going to have a couple of
 

6841
02:07:20,940 --> 02:07:22,970
probably going to have a couple of
cracks at it actually uh on that

6842
02:07:22,970 --> 02:07:22,980
cracks at it actually uh on that
 

6843
02:07:22,980 --> 02:07:25,729
cracks at it actually uh on that
timeline so this is where we have to be

6844
02:07:25,729 --> 02:07:25,739
timeline so this is where we have to be
 

6845
02:07:25,739 --> 02:07:27,830
timeline so this is where we have to be
careful though you say commercial Fusion

6846
02:07:27,830 --> 02:07:27,840
careful though you say commercial Fusion
 

6847
02:07:27,840 --> 02:07:29,810
careful though you say commercial Fusion
you know what does that mean commercial

6848
02:07:29,810 --> 02:07:29,820
you know what does that mean commercial
 

6849
02:07:29,820 --> 02:07:31,810
you know what does that mean commercial
Fusion to me means that you're actually

6850
02:07:31,810 --> 02:07:31,820
Fusion to me means that you're actually
 

6851
02:07:31,820 --> 02:07:35,570
Fusion to me means that you're actually
have a known quantity about what it

6852
02:07:35,570 --> 02:07:35,580
have a known quantity about what it
 

6853
02:07:35,580 --> 02:07:37,729
have a known quantity about what it
costs what it costs to build and what it

6854
02:07:37,729 --> 02:07:37,739
costs what it costs to build and what it
 

6855
02:07:37,739 --> 02:07:40,250
costs what it costs to build and what it
costs to operate the reliability of

6856
02:07:40,250 --> 02:07:40,260
costs to operate the reliability of
 

6857
02:07:40,260 --> 02:07:41,930
costs to operate the reliability of
putting energy on the grid that's

6858
02:07:41,930 --> 02:07:41,940
putting energy on the grid that's
 

6859
02:07:41,940 --> 02:07:44,750
putting energy on the grid that's
commercial Fusion it's like so it turns

6860
02:07:44,750 --> 02:07:44,760
commercial Fusion it's like so it turns
 

6861
02:07:44,760 --> 02:07:46,370
commercial Fusion it's like so it turns
out that that's not not necessarily

6862
02:07:46,370 --> 02:07:46,380
out that that's not not necessarily
 

6863
02:07:46,380 --> 02:07:48,589
out that that's not not necessarily
exactly the first Fusion devices that

6864
02:07:48,589 --> 02:07:48,599
exactly the first Fusion devices that
 

6865
02:07:48,599 --> 02:07:49,970
exactly the first Fusion devices that
put electricity on the grid because you

6866
02:07:49,970 --> 02:07:49,980
put electricity on the grid because you
 

6867
02:07:49,980 --> 02:07:51,470
put electricity on the grid because you
got it there's a learning curve to get

6868
02:07:51,470 --> 02:07:51,480
got it there's a learning curve to get
 

6869
02:07:51,480 --> 02:07:55,070
got it there's a learning curve to get
like better and better at it but that's

6870
02:07:55,070 --> 02:07:55,080
like better and better at it but that's
 

6871
02:07:55,080 --> 02:07:57,169
like better and better at it but that's
probably I would suspect the biggest

6872
02:07:57,169 --> 02:07:57,179
probably I would suspect the biggest
 

6873
02:07:57,179 --> 02:07:59,510
probably I would suspect the biggest
hurdle is to get to the first one the

6874
02:07:59,510 --> 02:07:59,520
hurdle is to get to the first one the
 

6875
02:07:59,520 --> 02:08:01,669
hurdle is to get to the first one the
work I've done uh the work I continue to

6876
02:08:01,669 --> 02:08:01,679
work I've done uh the work I continue to
 

6877
02:08:01,679 --> 02:08:02,930
work I've done uh the work I continue to
do with autonomous vehicles and

6878
02:08:02,930 --> 02:08:02,940
do with autonomous vehicles and
 

6879
02:08:02,940 --> 02:08:04,310
do with autonomous vehicles and
semi-autonomous vehicles there's an

6880
02:08:04,310 --> 02:08:04,320
semi-autonomous vehicles there's an
 

6881
02:08:04,320 --> 02:08:05,629
semi-autonomous vehicles there's an
interesting parallel there where a bunch

6882
02:08:05,629 --> 02:08:05,639
interesting parallel there where a bunch
 

6883
02:08:05,639 --> 02:08:08,510
interesting parallel there where a bunch
of companies announced a deadline for

6884
02:08:08,510 --> 02:08:08,520
of companies announced a deadline for
 

6885
02:08:08,520 --> 02:08:12,290
of companies announced a deadline for
themselves in 2020 21 22 and only a

6886
02:08:12,290 --> 02:08:12,300
themselves in 2020 21 22 and only a
 

6887
02:08:12,300 --> 02:08:13,790
themselves in 2020 21 22 and only a
small subset of those companies have

02:08:13,790 --> 02:08:13,800
small subset of those companies have
 

6889
02:08:13,800 --> 02:08:16,189
small subset of those companies have
actually really pushed that forward this

6890
02:08:16,189 --> 02:08:16,199
actually really pushed that forward this
 

6891
02:08:16,199 --> 02:08:19,970
actually really pushed that forward this
Google with waymo or alphabet rather uh

6892
02:08:19,970 --> 02:08:19,980
Google with waymo or alphabet rather uh
 

6893
02:08:19,980 --> 02:08:22,669
Google with waymo or alphabet rather uh
is do and and then there's uh

6894
02:08:22,669 --> 02:08:22,679
is do and and then there's uh
 

6895
02:08:22,679 --> 02:08:25,370
is do and and then there's uh
uh Tesla with semia Thomas driving in

6896
02:08:25,370 --> 02:08:25,380
uh Tesla with semia Thomas driving in
 

6897
02:08:25,380 --> 02:08:28,310
uh Tesla with semia Thomas driving in
their autopilot full self driving mode

6898
02:08:28,310 --> 02:08:28,320
their autopilot full self driving mode
 

6899
02:08:28,320 --> 02:08:30,950
their autopilot full self driving mode
and those are different approaches so

6900
02:08:30,950 --> 02:08:30,960
and those are different approaches so
 

6901
02:08:30,960 --> 02:08:32,930
and those are different approaches so
Tesla is achieving much much higher

6902
02:08:32,930 --> 02:08:32,940
Tesla is achieving much much higher
 

6903
02:08:32,940 --> 02:08:36,470
Tesla is achieving much much higher
scale but the sort of the quality of the

6904
02:08:36,470 --> 02:08:36,480
scale but the sort of the quality of the
 

6905
02:08:36,480 --> 02:08:39,109
scale but the sort of the quality of the
drive is semi-autonomous right I I don't

6906
02:08:39,109 --> 02:08:39,119
drive is semi-autonomous right I I don't
 

6907
02:08:39,119 --> 02:08:40,669
drive is semi-autonomous right I I don't
know if there's a metaphor or an analogy

6908
02:08:40,669 --> 02:08:40,679
know if there's a metaphor or an analogy
 

6909
02:08:40,679 --> 02:08:42,709
know if there's a metaphor or an analogy
here and then there's waymo that's

6910
02:08:42,709 --> 02:08:42,719
here and then there's waymo that's
 

6911
02:08:42,719 --> 02:08:44,570
here and then there's waymo that's
focusing on very specific cities but

6912
02:08:44,570 --> 02:08:44,580
focusing on very specific cities but
 

6913
02:08:44,580 --> 02:08:48,109
focusing on very specific cities but
achieving real full autonomy with actual

6914
02:08:48,109 --> 02:08:48,119
achieving real full autonomy with actual
 

6915
02:08:48,119 --> 02:08:49,970
achieving real full autonomy with actual
passengers but the scale is much smaller

6916
02:08:49,970 --> 02:08:49,980
passengers but the scale is much smaller
 

6917
02:08:49,980 --> 02:08:52,189
passengers but the scale is much smaller
so I wonder like just like you said

6918
02:08:52,189 --> 02:08:52,199
so I wonder like just like you said
 

6919
02:08:52,199 --> 02:08:53,689
so I wonder like just like you said
there would be these kinds of similar

6920
02:08:53,689 --> 02:08:53,699
there would be these kinds of similar
 

6921
02:08:53,699 --> 02:08:57,350
there would be these kinds of similar
kind of really hard pushes absolutely so

6922
02:08:57,350 --> 02:08:57,360
kind of really hard pushes absolutely so
 

6923
02:08:57,360 --> 02:08:59,390
kind of really hard pushes absolutely so
actually this is what I it's why I'm

6924
02:08:59,390 --> 02:08:59,400
actually this is what I it's why I'm
 

6925
02:08:59,400 --> 02:09:01,490
actually this is what I it's why I'm
encouraged about Fusion now so Fusion is

6926
02:09:01,490 --> 02:09:01,500
encouraged about Fusion now so Fusion is
 

6927
02:09:01,500 --> 02:09:03,290
encouraged about Fusion now so Fusion is
still hard let's let everyone be clear

6928
02:09:03,290 --> 02:09:03,300
still hard let's let everyone be clear
 

6929
02:09:03,300 --> 02:09:06,050
still hard let's let everyone be clear
because of the signs under underneath it

6930
02:09:06,050 --> 02:09:06,060
because of the signs under underneath it
 

6931
02:09:06,060 --> 02:09:07,970
because of the signs under underneath it
of us of achieving the right conditions

6932
02:09:07,970 --> 02:09:07,980
of us of achieving the right conditions
 

6933
02:09:07,980 --> 02:09:10,910
of us of achieving the right conditions
for the plasma basically is a is a is a

6934
02:09:10,910 --> 02:09:10,920
for the plasma basically is a is a is a
 

6935
02:09:10,920 --> 02:09:12,410
for the plasma basically is a is a is a
yardstick that you have to put up

6936
02:09:12,410 --> 02:09:12,420
yardstick that you have to put up
 

6937
02:09:12,420 --> 02:09:14,570
yardstick that you have to put up
against all of them what's encouraging

6938
02:09:14,570 --> 02:09:14,580
against all of them what's encouraging
 

6939
02:09:14,580 --> 02:09:16,550
against all of them what's encouraging
that I see in this and it's actually

6940
02:09:16,550 --> 02:09:16,560
that I see in this and it's actually
 

6941
02:09:16,560 --> 02:09:19,010
that I see in this and it's actually
what happens when you sort of let loose

6942
02:09:19,010 --> 02:09:19,020
what happens when you sort of let loose
 

6943
02:09:19,020 --> 02:09:22,790
what happens when you sort of let loose
the creativity of this is maybe I'll go

6944
02:09:22,790 --> 02:09:22,800
the creativity of this is maybe I'll go
 

6945
02:09:22,800 --> 02:09:24,950
the creativity of this is maybe I'll go
back to First principles so Fusion is a

6946
02:09:24,950 --> 02:09:24,960
back to First principles so Fusion is a
 

6947
02:09:24,960 --> 02:09:27,649
back to First principles so Fusion is a
also a fairly strange so if you think

6948
02:09:27,649 --> 02:09:27,659
also a fairly strange so if you think
 

6949
02:09:27,659 --> 02:09:30,229
also a fairly strange so if you think
about building a coal Point like burning

6950
02:09:30,229 --> 02:09:30,239
about building a coal Point like burning
 

6951
02:09:30,239 --> 02:09:32,510
about building a coal Point like burning
wood and coal and gas is actually not

6952
02:09:32,510 --> 02:09:32,520
wood and coal and gas is actually not
 

6953
02:09:32,520 --> 02:09:33,589
wood and coal and gas is actually not
that much different from each other

6954
02:09:33,589 --> 02:09:33,599
that much different from each other
 

6955
02:09:33,599 --> 02:09:35,570
that much different from each other
because they're kind of about the same

6956
02:09:35,570 --> 02:09:35,580
because they're kind of about the same
 

6957
02:09:35,580 --> 02:09:37,370
because they're kind of about the same
physical conditions and you get the fuel

6958
02:09:37,370 --> 02:09:37,380
physical conditions and you get the fuel
 

6959
02:09:37,380 --> 02:09:39,830
physical conditions and you get the fuel
and you light into the fusion is very

6960
02:09:39,830 --> 02:09:39,840
and you light into the fusion is very
 

6961
02:09:39,840 --> 02:09:41,450
and you light into the fusion is very
remember I told you that there's this

6962
02:09:41,450 --> 02:09:41,460
remember I told you that there's this
 

6963
02:09:41,460 --> 02:09:42,709
remember I told you that there's this
condition of the temperature which is

6964
02:09:42,709 --> 02:09:42,719
condition of the temperature which is
 

6965
02:09:42,719 --> 02:09:44,270
condition of the temperature which is
kind of universal

6966
02:09:44,270 --> 02:09:44,280
kind of universal
 

6967
02:09:44,280 --> 02:09:46,910
kind of universal
but if you take the density of the fuel

6968
02:09:46,910 --> 02:09:46,920
but if you take the density of the fuel
 

6969
02:09:46,920 --> 02:09:49,310
but if you take the density of the fuel
between magnetic fusion and inertial

6970
02:09:49,310 --> 02:09:49,320
between magnetic fusion and inertial
 

6971
02:09:49,320 --> 02:09:50,750
between magnetic fusion and inertial
fusion they're different by about a

6972
02:09:50,750 --> 02:09:50,760
fusion they're different by about a
 

6973
02:09:50,760 --> 02:09:52,330
fusion they're different by about a
factor of 10 billion

6974
02:09:52,330 --> 02:09:52,340
factor of 10 billion
 

6975
02:09:52,340 --> 02:09:55,189
factor of 10 billion
so this and the density fuel really

6976
02:09:55,189 --> 02:09:55,199
so this and the density fuel really
 

6977
02:09:55,199 --> 02:09:56,870
so this and the density fuel really
matters that actually so does the this

6978
02:09:56,870 --> 02:09:56,880
matters that actually so does the this
 

6979
02:09:56,880 --> 02:09:58,490
matters that actually so does the this
means energy confinement time is also

6980
02:09:58,490 --> 02:09:58,500
means energy confinement time is also
 

6981
02:09:58,500 --> 02:10:00,109
means energy confinement time is also
different by a factor of 10 billion as

6982
02:10:00,109 --> 02:10:00,119
different by a factor of 10 billion as
 

6983
02:10:00,119 --> 02:10:01,729
different by a factor of 10 billion as
well too because it's the product of

6984
02:10:01,729 --> 02:10:01,739
well too because it's the product of
 

6985
02:10:01,739 --> 02:10:03,770
well too because it's the product of
those two so one's really dense and

6986
02:10:03,770 --> 02:10:03,780
those two so one's really dense and
 

6987
02:10:03,780 --> 02:10:05,870
those two so one's really dense and
short lived and the other ones really

6988
02:10:05,870 --> 02:10:05,880
short lived and the other ones really
 

6989
02:10:05,880 --> 02:10:07,970
short lived and the other ones really
long-lived and and actually under dense

6990
02:10:07,970 --> 02:10:07,980
long-lived and and actually under dense
 

6991
02:10:07,980 --> 02:10:09,410
long-lived and and actually under dense
as well too

6992
02:10:09,410 --> 02:10:09,420
as well too
 

6993
02:10:09,420 --> 02:10:13,370
as well too
so what that means is that the way to to

6994
02:10:13,370 --> 02:10:13,380
so what that means is that the way to to
 

6995
02:10:13,380 --> 02:10:16,129
so what that means is that the way to to
the the way to the to get the underlying

6996
02:10:16,129 --> 02:10:16,139
the the way to the to get the underlying
 

6997
02:10:16,139 --> 02:10:18,350
the the way to the to get the underlying
physical state is so different among

6998
02:10:18,350 --> 02:10:18,360
physical state is so different among
 

6999
02:10:18,360 --> 02:10:20,570
physical state is so different among
these different approaches what it lends

7000
02:10:20,570 --> 02:10:20,580
these different approaches what it lends
 

7001
02:10:20,580 --> 02:10:23,270
these different approaches what it lends
itself to is does this mean that

7002
02:10:23,270 --> 02:10:23,280
itself to is does this mean that
 

7003
02:10:23,280 --> 02:10:25,790
itself to is does this mean that
eventual commercial products will

7004
02:10:25,790 --> 02:10:25,800
eventual commercial products will
 

7005
02:10:25,800 --> 02:10:28,310
eventual commercial products will
actually fill different needs in the

7006
02:10:28,310 --> 02:10:28,320
actually fill different needs in the
 

7007
02:10:28,320 --> 02:10:30,350
actually fill different needs in the
energy system so it sort of goes to your

7008
02:10:30,350 --> 02:10:30,360
energy system so it sort of goes to your
 

7009
02:10:30,360 --> 02:10:33,850
energy system so it sort of goes to your
comment about

7010
02:10:33,850 --> 02:10:33,860

 

7011
02:10:33,860 --> 02:10:37,189

because anything that is high tech and

7012
02:10:37,189 --> 02:10:37,199
because anything that is high tech and
 

7013
02:10:37,199 --> 02:10:39,109
because anything that is high tech and
is like a really important thing in our

7014
02:10:39,109 --> 02:10:39,119
is like a really important thing in our
 

7015
02:10:39,119 --> 02:10:42,109
is like a really important thing in our
economy tends to never find its way as

7016
02:10:42,109 --> 02:10:42,119
economy tends to never find its way as
 

7017
02:10:42,119 --> 02:10:44,990
economy tends to never find its way as
one only one manifestation like look at

7018
02:10:44,990 --> 02:10:45,000
one only one manifestation like look at
 

7019
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:47,089
one only one manifestation like look at
Transportation as well too we have

7020
02:10:47,089 --> 02:10:47,099
Transportation as well too we have
 

7021
02:10:47,099 --> 02:10:48,370
Transportation as well too we have
scooters

7022
02:10:48,370 --> 02:10:48,380
scooters
 

7023
02:10:48,380 --> 02:10:52,910
scooters
Vespas you know uh Overland trucks cars

7024
02:10:52,910 --> 02:10:52,920
Vespas you know uh Overland trucks cars
 

7025
02:10:52,920 --> 02:10:54,709
Vespas you know uh Overland trucks cars
electric cars of course we have these

7026
02:10:54,709 --> 02:10:54,719
electric cars of course we have these
 

7027
02:10:54,719 --> 02:10:56,390
electric cars of course we have these
because they meet different demands in

7028
02:10:56,390 --> 02:10:56,400
because they meet different demands in
 

7029
02:10:56,400 --> 02:10:58,970
because they meet different demands in
it so what's interesting you know that I

7030
02:10:58,970 --> 02:10:58,980
it so what's interesting you know that I
 

7031
02:10:58,980 --> 02:11:00,589
it so what's interesting you know that I
find fascinating now is that we have

7032
02:11:00,589 --> 02:11:00,599
find fascinating now is that we have
 

7033
02:11:00,599 --> 02:11:02,689
find fascinating now is that we have
infusion it's going to look like that

7034
02:11:02,689 --> 02:11:02,699
infusion it's going to look like that
 

7035
02:11:02,699 --> 02:11:05,750
infusion it's going to look like that
that probably there's the while the

7036
02:11:05,750 --> 02:11:05,760
that probably there's the while the
 

7037
02:11:05,760 --> 02:11:07,490
that probably there's the while the
near-term focuses on electricity

7038
02:11:07,490 --> 02:11:07,500
near-term focuses on electricity
 

7039
02:11:07,500 --> 02:11:09,649
near-term focuses on electricity
production there might even be different

7040
02:11:09,649 --> 02:11:09,659
production there might even be different
 

7041
02:11:09,659 --> 02:11:11,390
production there might even be different
kinds of markets that actually make

7042
02:11:11,390 --> 02:11:11,400
kinds of markets that actually make
 

7043
02:11:11,400 --> 02:11:14,390
kinds of markets that actually make
sense in some places less than others it

7044
02:11:14,390 --> 02:11:14,400
sense in some places less than others it
 

7045
02:11:14,400 --> 02:11:16,189
sense in some places less than others it
comes to trade-offs because we haven't

7046
02:11:16,189 --> 02:11:16,199
comes to trade-offs because we haven't
 

7047
02:11:16,199 --> 02:11:17,570
comes to trade-offs because we haven't
really talked about the engineering yet

7048
02:11:17,570 --> 02:11:17,580
really talked about the engineering yet
 

7049
02:11:17,580 --> 02:11:19,910
really talked about the engineering yet
but engineering really matters like to

7050
02:11:19,910 --> 02:11:19,920
but engineering really matters like to
 

7051
02:11:19,920 --> 02:11:22,609
but engineering really matters like to
them to the operation of the device and

7052
02:11:22,609 --> 02:11:22,619
them to the operation of the device and
 

7053
02:11:22,619 --> 02:11:24,169
them to the operation of the device and
so it could be

7054
02:11:24,169 --> 02:11:24,179
so it could be
 

7055
02:11:24,179 --> 02:11:26,149
so it could be
um that that you know I suspect what

7056
02:11:26,149 --> 02:11:26,159
um that that you know I suspect what
 

7057
02:11:26,159 --> 02:11:27,950
um that that you know I suspect what
we'll end up with is several different

7058
02:11:27,950 --> 02:11:27,960
we'll end up with is several different
 

7059
02:11:27,960 --> 02:11:29,570
we'll end up with is several different
configurations which have different

7060
02:11:29,570 --> 02:11:29,580
configurations which have different
 

7061
02:11:29,580 --> 02:11:31,430
configurations which have different
features which are trade-offs basically

7062
02:11:31,430 --> 02:11:31,440
features which are trade-offs basically
 

7063
02:11:31,440 --> 02:11:34,310
features which are trade-offs basically
in in the energy Market whether he says

7064
02:11:34,310 --> 02:11:34,320
in in the energy Market whether he says
 

7065
02:11:34,320 --> 02:11:35,930
in in the energy Market whether he says
the major engineering

7066
02:11:35,930 --> 02:11:35,940
the major engineering
 

7067
02:11:35,940 --> 02:11:38,930
the major engineering
or general hurdles yeah that are in the

7068
02:11:38,930 --> 02:11:38,940
or general hurdles yeah that are in the
 

7069
02:11:38,940 --> 02:11:40,609
or general hurdles yeah that are in the
way yeah

7070
02:11:40,609 --> 02:11:40,619
way yeah
 

7071
02:11:40,619 --> 02:11:43,729
way yeah
um so the first one is just the cost of

7072
02:11:43,729 --> 02:11:43,739
um so the first one is just the cost of
 

7073
02:11:43,739 --> 02:11:46,129
um so the first one is just the cost of
building a single unit

7074
02:11:46,129 --> 02:11:46,139
building a single unit
 

7075
02:11:46,139 --> 02:11:48,410
building a single unit
so Fusion has and is actually

7076
02:11:48,410 --> 02:11:48,420
so Fusion has and is actually
 

7077
02:11:48,420 --> 02:11:49,669
so Fusion has and is actually
interesting you talked about the about

7078
02:11:49,669 --> 02:11:49,679
interesting you talked about the about
 

7079
02:11:49,679 --> 02:11:51,169
interesting you talked about the about
the different models that you have so

7080
02:11:51,169 --> 02:11:51,179
the different models that you have so
 

7081
02:11:51,179 --> 02:11:53,390
the different models that you have so
Fusion has

7082
02:11:53,390 --> 02:11:53,400
Fusion has
 

7083
02:11:53,400 --> 02:11:56,149
Fusion has
um one of its interesting limitations is

7084
02:11:56,149 --> 02:11:56,159
um one of its interesting limitations is
 

7085
02:11:56,159 --> 02:11:57,970
um one of its interesting limitations is
that it's very hard

7086
02:11:57,970 --> 02:11:57,980
that it's very hard
 

7087
02:11:57,980 --> 02:12:00,169
that it's very hard
almost at some point becomes physically

7088
02:12:00,169 --> 02:12:00,179
almost at some point becomes physically
 

7089
02:12:00,179 --> 02:12:02,629
almost at some point becomes physically
impossible to actually make small power

7090
02:12:02,629 --> 02:12:02,639
impossible to actually make small power
 

7091
02:12:02,639 --> 02:12:04,070
impossible to actually make small power
units

7092
02:12:04,070 --> 02:12:04,080
units
 

7093
02:12:04,080 --> 02:12:06,709
units
like a kilowatt a thousand Watts you

7094
02:12:06,709 --> 02:12:06,719
like a kilowatt a thousand Watts you
 

7095
02:12:06,719 --> 02:12:08,390
like a kilowatt a thousand Watts you
know which is like a personal home like

7096
02:12:08,390 --> 02:12:08,400
know which is like a personal home like
 

7097
02:12:08,400 --> 02:12:10,129
know which is like a personal home like
you know this is about a thousand

7098
02:12:10,129 --> 02:12:10,139
you know this is about a thousand
 

7099
02:12:10,139 --> 02:12:11,870
you know this is about a thousand
dollars or your personal use of an

7100
02:12:11,870 --> 02:12:11,880
dollars or your personal use of an
 

7101
02:12:11,880 --> 02:12:13,790
dollars or your personal use of an
energy of electricities but like a

7102
02:12:13,790 --> 02:12:13,800
energy of electricities but like a
 

7103
02:12:13,800 --> 02:12:15,229
energy of electricities but like a
thousand Watts

7104
02:12:15,229 --> 02:12:15,239
thousand Watts
 

7105
02:12:15,239 --> 02:12:17,510
thousand Watts
um this is basically impossible and if

7106
02:12:17,510 --> 02:12:17,520
um this is basically impossible and if
 

7107
02:12:17,520 --> 02:12:20,810
um this is basically impossible and if
for a single you know unit to do this

7108
02:12:20,810 --> 02:12:20,820
for a single you know unit to do this
 

7109
02:12:20,820 --> 02:12:22,129
for a single you know unit to do this
um so like you're not gonna have a

7110
02:12:22,129 --> 02:12:22,139
um so like you're not gonna have a
 

7111
02:12:22,139 --> 02:12:24,290
um so like you're not gonna have a
fusion like power plant like is your

7112
02:12:24,290 --> 02:12:24,300
fusion like power plant like is your
 

7113
02:12:24,300 --> 02:12:26,510
fusion like power plant like is your
furnace in or your electric heater in

7114
02:12:26,510 --> 02:12:26,520
furnace in or your electric heater in
 

7115
02:12:26,520 --> 02:12:29,030
furnace in or your electric heater in
your home and the reason for this comes

7116
02:12:29,030 --> 02:12:29,040
your home and the reason for this comes
 

7117
02:12:29,040 --> 02:12:31,790
your home and the reason for this comes
from the fact that Fusion relies on it

7118
02:12:31,790 --> 02:12:31,800
from the fact that Fusion relies on it
 

7119
02:12:31,800 --> 02:12:33,709
from the fact that Fusion relies on it
being it's not just that it's very hot

7120
02:12:33,709 --> 02:12:33,719
being it's not just that it's very hot
 

7121
02:12:33,719 --> 02:12:36,169
being it's not just that it's very hot
it says that the fusion power is the

7122
02:12:36,169 --> 02:12:36,179
it says that the fusion power is the
 

7123
02:12:36,179 --> 02:12:38,510
it says that the fusion power is the
heating source to keep it hot so if if

7124
02:12:38,510 --> 02:12:38,520
heating source to keep it hot so if if
 

7125
02:12:38,520 --> 02:12:40,850
heating source to keep it hot so if if
you get if you go too small it basically

7126
02:12:40,850 --> 02:12:40,860
you get if you go too small it basically
 

7127
02:12:40,860 --> 02:12:43,490
you get if you go too small it basically
just cannot keep it hot that's

7128
02:12:43,490 --> 02:12:43,500
just cannot keep it hot that's
 

7129
02:12:43,500 --> 02:12:45,290
just cannot keep it hot that's
um so it's interesting is that this so

7130
02:12:45,290 --> 02:12:45,300
um so it's interesting is that this so
 

7131
02:12:45,300 --> 02:12:46,669
um so it's interesting is that this so
this is one of the hard parts so this

7132
02:12:46,669 --> 02:12:46,679
this is one of the hard parts so this
 

7133
02:12:46,679 --> 02:12:49,069
this is one of the hard parts so this
means that the individual units you know

7134
02:12:49,069 --> 02:12:49,079
means that the individual units you know
 

7135
02:12:49,079 --> 02:12:51,050
means that the individual units you know
and it's it varies from concept to

7136
02:12:51,050 --> 02:12:51,060
and it's it varies from concept to
 

7137
02:12:51,060 --> 02:12:53,510
and it's it varies from concept to
concept but the the national academies

7138
02:12:53,510 --> 02:12:53,520
concept but the the national academies
 

7139
02:12:53,520 --> 02:12:56,030
concept but the the national academies
report that came out last year sort of

7140
02:12:56,030 --> 02:12:56,040
report that came out last year sort of
 

7141
02:12:56,040 --> 02:12:59,209
report that came out last year sort of
put the Benchmark as being like probably

7142
02:12:59,209 --> 02:12:59,219
put the Benchmark as being like probably
 

7143
02:12:59,219 --> 02:13:01,609
put the Benchmark as being like probably
the minimum size looks like around 50

7144
02:13:01,609 --> 02:13:01,619
the minimum size looks like around 50
 

7145
02:13:01,619 --> 02:13:03,709
the minimum size looks like around 50
million watts of electricity which is

7146
02:13:03,709 --> 02:13:03,719
million watts of electricity which is
 

7147
02:13:03,719 --> 02:13:05,569
million watts of electricity which is
like another for like a meat like a

7148
02:13:05,569 --> 02:13:05,579
like another for like a meat like a
 

7149
02:13:05,579 --> 02:13:08,089
like another for like a meat like a
small to you know mid-sized City

7150
02:13:08,089 --> 02:13:08,099
small to you know mid-sized City
 

7151
02:13:08,099 --> 02:13:09,830
small to you know mid-sized City
actually

7152
02:13:09,830 --> 02:13:09,840
actually
 

7153
02:13:09,840 --> 02:13:12,649
actually
um so that is so that's sort of like a

7154
02:13:12,649 --> 02:13:12,659
um so that is so that's sort of like a
 

7155
02:13:12,659 --> 02:13:14,330
um so that is so that's sort of like a
scale Challenge and in fact it's one of

7156
02:13:14,330 --> 02:13:14,340
scale Challenge and in fact it's one of
 

7157
02:13:14,340 --> 02:13:16,850
scale Challenge and in fact it's one of
the reasons why in Commonwealth and

7158
02:13:16,850 --> 02:13:16,860
the reasons why in Commonwealth and
 

7159
02:13:16,860 --> 02:13:19,669
the reasons why in Commonwealth and
another private sector ones like we they

7160
02:13:19,669 --> 02:13:19,679
another private sector ones like we they
 

7161
02:13:19,679 --> 02:13:21,709
another private sector ones like we they
try to push this down actually of trying

7162
02:13:21,709 --> 02:13:21,719
try to push this down actually of trying
 

7163
02:13:21,719 --> 02:13:23,569
try to push this down actually of trying
to get to the to these smaller units

7164
02:13:23,569 --> 02:13:23,579
to get to the to these smaller units
 

7165
02:13:23,579 --> 02:13:26,330
to get to the to these smaller units
just because it reduces the cost of it

7166
02:13:26,330 --> 02:13:26,340
just because it reduces the cost of it
 

7167
02:13:26,340 --> 02:13:28,609
just because it reduces the cost of it
um then probably

7168
02:13:28,609 --> 02:13:28,619
um then probably
 

7169
02:13:28,619 --> 02:13:31,310
um then probably
um obviously I would say it's an obvious

7170
02:13:31,310 --> 02:13:31,320
um obviously I would say it's an obvious
 

7171
02:13:31,320 --> 02:13:32,990
um obviously I would say it's an obvious
one like achieving the fusion State

7172
02:13:32,990 --> 02:13:33,000
one like achieving the fusion State
 

7173
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:36,169
one like achieving the fusion State
itself and High Gain Is is a hard one

7174
02:13:36,169 --> 02:13:36,179
itself and High Gain Is is a hard one
 

7175
02:13:36,179 --> 02:13:37,729
itself and High Gain Is is a hard one
what we already talked about what kind

7176
02:13:37,729 --> 02:13:37,739
what we already talked about what kind
 

7177
02:13:37,739 --> 02:13:39,169
what we already talked about what kind
of harder what kind of challenges that

7178
02:13:39,169 --> 02:13:39,179
of harder what kind of challenges that
 

7179
02:13:39,179 --> 02:13:40,790
of harder what kind of challenges that
that's achieving the right temperature

7180
02:13:40,790 --> 02:13:40,800
that's achieving the right temperature
 

7181
02:13:40,800 --> 02:13:43,189
that's achieving the right temperature
density and energy confinement time in

7182
02:13:43,189 --> 02:13:43,199
density and energy confinement time in
 

7183
02:13:43,199 --> 02:13:45,770
density and energy confinement time in
the fuel itself in the plasma itself and

7184
02:13:45,770 --> 02:13:45,780
the fuel itself in the plasma itself and
 

7185
02:13:45,780 --> 02:13:47,990
the fuel itself in the plasma itself and
so some of the so some of the the

7186
02:13:47,990 --> 02:13:48,000
so some of the so some of the the
 

7187
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:49,970
so some of the so some of the the
configurations which are being chosen

7188
02:13:49,970 --> 02:13:49,980
configurations which are being chosen
 

7189
02:13:49,980 --> 02:13:52,910
configurations which are being chosen
have are actually uh I have quite a ways

7190
02:13:52,910 --> 02:13:52,920
have are actually uh I have quite a ways
 

7191
02:13:52,920 --> 02:13:55,669
have are actually uh I have quite a ways
to go in fact I've seen those but what

7192
02:13:55,669 --> 02:13:55,679
to go in fact I've seen those but what
 

7193
02:13:55,679 --> 02:13:57,950
to go in fact I've seen those but what
their their consideration is oh yes but

7194
02:13:57,950 --> 02:13:57,960
their their consideration is oh yes but
 

7195
02:13:57,960 --> 02:14:00,290
their their consideration is oh yes but
by our particular configuration the

7196
02:14:00,290 --> 02:14:00,300
by our particular configuration the
 

7197
02:14:00,300 --> 02:14:02,450
by our particular configuration the
engineering Simplicity confers like an

7198
02:14:02,450 --> 02:14:02,460
engineering Simplicity confers like an
 

7199
02:14:02,460 --> 02:14:03,950
engineering Simplicity confers like an
economic Advantage even if we're behind

7200
02:14:03,950 --> 02:14:03,960
economic Advantage even if we're behind
 

7201
02:14:03,960 --> 02:14:07,069
economic Advantage even if we're behind
in sort of an assigned sense okay which

7202
02:14:07,069 --> 02:14:07,079
in sort of an assigned sense okay which
 

7203
02:14:07,079 --> 02:14:09,050
in sort of an assigned sense okay which
is fine this is also what you get when

7204
02:14:09,050 --> 02:14:09,060
is fine this is also what you get when
 

7205
02:14:09,060 --> 02:14:11,510
is fine this is also what you get when
you get a an explosion in in the private

7206
02:14:11,510 --> 02:14:11,520
you get a an explosion in in the private
 

7207
02:14:11,520 --> 02:14:13,069
you get a an explosion in in the private
sector you basically are Distributing

7208
02:14:13,069 --> 02:14:13,079
sector you basically are Distributing
 

7209
02:14:13,079 --> 02:14:14,689
sector you basically are Distributing
risks in different ways right which

7210
02:14:14,689 --> 02:14:14,699
risks in different ways right which
 

7211
02:14:14,699 --> 02:14:16,550
risks in different ways right which
makes sense

7212
02:14:16,550 --> 02:14:16,560
makes sense
 

7213
02:14:16,560 --> 02:14:18,950
makes sense
um all of that good that so what I would

7214
02:14:18,950 --> 02:14:18,960
um all of that good that so what I would
 

7215
02:14:18,960 --> 02:14:21,290
um all of that good that so what I would
say is that the the next hurdle to

7216
02:14:21,290 --> 02:14:21,300
say is that the the next hurdle to
 

7217
02:14:21,300 --> 02:14:23,810
say is that the the next hurdle to
really overcome is is about making that

7218
02:14:23,810 --> 02:14:23,820
really overcome is is about making that
 

7219
02:14:23,820 --> 02:14:27,350
really overcome is is about making that
electricity so like we need to see a

7220
02:14:27,350 --> 02:14:27,360
electricity so like we need to see a
 

7221
02:14:27,360 --> 02:14:29,629
electricity so like we need to see a
unit or several units like put using

7222
02:14:29,629 --> 02:14:29,639
unit or several units like put using
 

7223
02:14:29,639 --> 02:14:31,790
unit or several units like put using
Fusion in some way to put a meaningful

7224
02:14:31,790 --> 02:14:31,800
Fusion in some way to put a meaningful
 

7225
02:14:31,800 --> 02:14:33,890
Fusion in some way to put a meaningful
amount of energy on the grid because

7226
02:14:33,890 --> 02:14:33,900
amount of energy on the grid because
 

7227
02:14:33,900 --> 02:14:38,089
amount of energy on the grid because
this starts giving us real answers

7228
02:14:38,089 --> 02:14:38,099
this starts giving us real answers
 

7229
02:14:38,099 --> 02:14:40,250
this starts giving us real answers
um as to like what this is going to look

7230
02:14:40,250 --> 02:14:40,260
um as to like what this is going to look
 

7231
02:14:40,260 --> 02:14:42,169
um as to like what this is going to look
like the full end to end the full

7232
02:14:42,169 --> 02:14:42,179
like the full end to end the full
 

7233
02:14:42,179 --> 02:14:44,330
like the full end to end the full
end-to-end thing so Commonwealth's goal

7234
02:14:44,330 --> 02:14:44,340
end-to-end thing so Commonwealth's goal
 

7235
02:14:44,340 --> 02:14:46,310
end-to-end thing so Commonwealth's goal
is that I'll I'll just comment to

7236
02:14:46,310 --> 02:14:46,320
is that I'll I'll just comment to
 

7237
02:14:46,320 --> 02:14:48,050
is that I'll I'll just comment to
Commonwealth because I'll take some you

7238
02:14:48,050 --> 02:14:48,060
Commonwealth because I'll take some you
 

7239
02:14:48,060 --> 02:14:50,270
Commonwealth because I'll take some you
know some I get some credit for this is

7240
02:14:50,270 --> 02:14:50,280
know some I get some credit for this is
 

7241
02:14:50,280 --> 02:14:53,149
know some I get some credit for this is
that the the origins of Commonwealth

7242
02:14:53,149 --> 02:14:53,159
that the the origins of Commonwealth
 

7243
02:14:53,159 --> 02:14:55,850
that the the origins of Commonwealth
were in fact in examining that like we

7244
02:14:55,850 --> 02:14:55,860
were in fact in examining that like we
 

7245
02:14:55,860 --> 02:14:57,589
were in fact in examining that like we
could see this new technology coming

7246
02:14:57,589 --> 02:14:57,599
could see this new technology coming
 

7247
02:14:57,599 --> 02:14:59,390
could see this new technology coming
forward this this new superconducting

7248
02:14:59,390 --> 02:14:59,400
forward this this new superconducting
 

7249
02:14:59,400 --> 02:15:01,729
forward this this new superconducting
material and the origins of our thought

7250
02:15:01,729 --> 02:15:01,739
material and the origins of our thought
 

7251
02:15:01,739 --> 02:15:03,890
material and the origins of our thought
process were really around designing

7252
02:15:03,890 --> 02:15:03,900
process were really around designing
 

7253
02:15:03,900 --> 02:15:05,990
process were really around designing
effectively the pilot plant or the

7254
02:15:05,990 --> 02:15:06,000
effectively the pilot plant or the
 

7255
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,270
effectively the pilot plant or the
commercial unit it's called Arc which is

7256
02:15:08,270 --> 02:15:08,280
commercial unit it's called Arc which is
 

7257
02:15:08,280 --> 02:15:10,370
commercial unit it's called Arc which is
actually the step forward after spark

7258
02:15:10,370 --> 02:15:10,380
actually the step forward after spark
 

7259
02:15:10,380 --> 02:15:12,830
actually the step forward after spark
and that was the orig the origins of it

7260
02:15:12,830 --> 02:15:12,840
and that was the orig the origins of it
 

7261
02:15:12,840 --> 02:15:14,330
and that was the orig the origins of it
so all the things that were other parts

7262
02:15:14,330 --> 02:15:14,340
so all the things that were other parts
 

7263
02:15:14,340 --> 02:15:16,250
so all the things that were other parts
of the plan like spark and the magnet

7264
02:15:16,250 --> 02:15:16,260
of the plan like spark and the magnet
 

7265
02:15:16,260 --> 02:15:19,729
of the plan like spark and the magnet
were actually all informed totally by

7266
02:15:19,729 --> 02:15:19,739
were actually all informed totally by
 

7267
02:15:19,739 --> 02:15:20,990
were actually all informed totally by
building something that's going to put

7268
02:15:20,990 --> 02:15:21,000
building something that's going to put
 

7269
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:23,149
building something that's going to put
net electricity on the grid and the

7270
02:15:23,149 --> 02:15:23,159
net electricity on the grid and the
 

7271
02:15:23,159 --> 02:15:24,770
net electricity on the grid and the
timing of that we still hope is actually

7272
02:15:24,770 --> 02:15:24,780
timing of that we still hope is actually
 

7273
02:15:24,780 --> 02:15:27,530
timing of that we still hope is actually
the early 2030s so spark is the design

7274
02:15:27,530 --> 02:15:27,540
the early 2030s so spark is the design
 

7275
02:15:27,540 --> 02:15:29,689
the early 2030s so spark is the design
of the takamakan arc as the actual full

7276
02:15:29,689 --> 02:15:29,699
of the takamakan arc as the actual full
 

7277
02:15:29,699 --> 02:15:31,310
of the takamakan arc as the actual full
and thing it's like a thing that

7278
02:15:31,310 --> 02:15:31,320
and thing it's like a thing that
 

7279
02:15:31,320 --> 02:15:32,990
and thing it's like a thing that
actually puts the energy on the grid so

7280
02:15:32,990 --> 02:15:33,000
actually puts the energy on the grid so
 

7281
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:35,030
actually puts the energy on the grid so
spark is named you know intentionally

7282
02:15:35,030 --> 02:15:35,040
spark is named you know intentionally
 

7283
02:15:35,040 --> 02:15:36,770
spark is named you know intentionally
that it's like it's on for a short

7284
02:15:36,770 --> 02:15:36,780
that it's like it's on for a short
 

7285
02:15:36,780 --> 02:15:38,870
that it's like it's on for a short
period period of time and it doesn't

7286
02:15:38,870 --> 02:15:38,880
period period of time and it doesn't
 

7287
02:15:38,880 --> 02:15:41,510
period period of time and it doesn't
have a it has yeah yeah you know it's

7288
02:15:41,510 --> 02:15:41,520
have a it has yeah yeah you know it's
 

7289
02:15:41,520 --> 02:15:43,129
have a it has yeah yeah you know it's
the spark of the fusion you know

7290
02:15:43,129 --> 02:15:43,139
the spark of the fusion you know
 

7291
02:15:43,139 --> 02:15:44,750
the spark of the fusion you know
Revolution or something like that I

7292
02:15:44,750 --> 02:15:44,760
Revolution or something like that I
 

7293
02:15:44,760 --> 02:15:46,790
Revolution or something like that I
guess we could call it um

7294
02:15:46,790 --> 02:15:46,800
guess we could call it um
 

7295
02:15:46,800 --> 02:15:49,669
guess we could call it um
yeah so those are those are so those are

7296
02:15:49,669 --> 02:15:49,679
yeah so those are those are so those are
 

7297
02:15:49,679 --> 02:15:51,589
yeah so those are those are so those are
sort of the programmatic challenges of

7298
02:15:51,589 --> 02:15:51,599
sort of the programmatic challenges of
 

7299
02:15:51,599 --> 02:15:53,089
sort of the programmatic challenges of
doing that and

7300
02:15:53,089 --> 02:15:53,099
doing that and
 

7301
02:15:53,099 --> 02:15:54,770
doing that and
um you know it's interesting you asked

7302
02:15:54,770 --> 02:15:54,780
um you know it's interesting you asked
 

7303
02:15:54,780 --> 02:15:56,810
um you know it's interesting you asked
about you talked about SpaceX so what

7304
02:15:56,810 --> 02:15:56,820
about you talked about SpaceX so what
 

7305
02:15:56,820 --> 02:15:59,689
about you talked about SpaceX so what
has evolved even in the last year or so

7306
02:15:59,689 --> 02:15:59,699
has evolved even in the last year or so
 

7307
02:15:59,699 --> 02:16:03,290
has evolved even in the last year or so
was in fact in March of 2022 the White

7308
02:16:03,290 --> 02:16:03,300
was in fact in March of 2022 the White
 

7309
02:16:03,300 --> 02:16:04,790
was in fact in March of 2022 the White
House announced that it was going to

7310
02:16:04,790 --> 02:16:04,800
House announced that it was going to
 

7311
02:16:04,800 --> 02:16:07,250
House announced that it was going to
start a program that kind of looks like

7312
02:16:07,250 --> 02:16:07,260
start a program that kind of looks like
 

7313
02:16:07,260 --> 02:16:10,850
start a program that kind of looks like
a SpaceX analogy that namely wow we've

7314
02:16:10,850 --> 02:16:10,860
a SpaceX analogy that namely wow we've
 

7315
02:16:10,860 --> 02:16:12,410
a SpaceX analogy that namely wow we've
got these things in the private sector

7316
02:16:12,410 --> 02:16:12,420
got these things in the private sector
 

7317
02:16:12,420 --> 02:16:14,209
got these things in the private sector
we should leverage the private sector

7318
02:16:14,209 --> 02:16:14,219
we should leverage the private sector
 

7319
02:16:14,219 --> 02:16:16,010
we should leverage the private sector
and the advantages of what they obtain

7320
02:16:16,010 --> 02:16:16,020
and the advantages of what they obtain
 

7321
02:16:16,020 --> 02:16:18,290
and the advantages of what they obtain
but also with the things like this is

7322
02:16:18,290 --> 02:16:18,300
but also with the things like this is
 

7323
02:16:18,300 --> 02:16:19,550
but also with the things like this is
going to be hard and it's going to cut

7324
02:16:19,550 --> 02:16:19,560
going to be hard and it's going to cut
 

7325
02:16:19,560 --> 02:16:21,229
going to be hard and it's going to cut
it's going to take quite a bit of

7326
02:16:21,229 --> 02:16:21,239
it's going to take quite a bit of
 

7327
02:16:21,239 --> 02:16:23,390
it's going to take quite a bit of
financing so why don't we set up a

7328
02:16:23,390 --> 02:16:23,400
financing so why don't we set up a
 

7329
02:16:23,400 --> 02:16:25,490
financing so why don't we set up a
program where we don't really get in the

7330
02:16:25,490 --> 02:16:25,500
program where we don't really get in the
 

7331
02:16:25,500 --> 02:16:27,050
program where we don't really get in the
way of the private sector Fusion

7332
02:16:27,050 --> 02:16:27,060
way of the private sector Fusion
 

7333
02:16:27,060 --> 02:16:28,850
way of the private sector Fusion
companies but we help them Finance these

7334
02:16:28,850 --> 02:16:28,860
companies but we help them Finance these
 

7335
02:16:28,860 --> 02:16:30,589
companies but we help them Finance these
difficult things which is how SpaceX

7336
02:16:30,589 --> 02:16:30,599
difficult things which is how SpaceX
 

7337
02:16:30,599 --> 02:16:32,690
difficult things which is how SpaceX
basically became successful through the

7338
02:16:32,690 --> 02:16:32,700
basically became successful through the
 

7339
02:16:32,700 --> 02:16:35,030
basically became successful through the
cots program fantastic right and that's

7340
02:16:35,030 --> 02:16:35,040
cots program fantastic right and that's
 

7341
02:16:35,040 --> 02:16:37,969
cots program fantastic right and that's
evolving as well too so like the fusion

7342
02:16:37,969 --> 02:16:37,979
evolving as well too so like the fusion
 

7343
02:16:37,979 --> 02:16:40,190
evolving as well too so like the fusion
ecosystem is almost unrecognizable from

7344
02:16:40,190 --> 02:16:40,200
ecosystem is almost unrecognizable from
 

7345
02:16:40,200 --> 02:16:42,110
ecosystem is almost unrecognizable from
where it was like five years ago around

7346
02:16:42,110 --> 02:16:42,120
where it was like five years ago around
 

7347
02:16:42,120 --> 02:16:44,990
where it was like five years ago around
those things how important is it for the

7348
02:16:44,990 --> 02:16:45,000
those things how important is it for the
 

7349
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:48,049
those things how important is it for the
heads of the companies that are working

7350
02:16:48,049 --> 02:16:48,059
heads of the companies that are working
 

7351
02:16:48,059 --> 02:16:49,549
heads of the companies that are working
on nuclear fusion to have a Twitter

7352
02:16:49,549 --> 02:16:49,559
on nuclear fusion to have a Twitter
 

7353
02:16:49,559 --> 02:16:52,190
on nuclear fusion to have a Twitter
account and to be quite you said you

7354
02:16:52,190 --> 02:16:52,200
account and to be quite you said you
 

7355
02:16:52,200 --> 02:16:54,070
account and to be quite you said you
don't use Twitter I don't use that much

7356
02:16:54,070 --> 02:16:54,080
don't use Twitter I don't use that much
 

7357
02:16:54,080 --> 02:16:56,990
don't use Twitter I don't use that much
I mean there there is some element to

7358
02:16:56,990 --> 02:16:57,000
I mean there there is some element to
 

7359
02:16:57,000 --> 02:16:58,250
I mean there there is some element to
and I don't think this should be

7360
02:16:58,250 --> 02:16:58,260
and I don't think this should be
 

7361
02:16:58,260 --> 02:17:00,770
and I don't think this should be
discounted whatever you think about uh

7362
02:17:00,770 --> 02:17:00,780
discounted whatever you think about uh
 

7363
02:17:00,780 --> 02:17:03,169
discounted whatever you think about uh
figures like Jeff Bezos uh with blue

7364
02:17:03,169 --> 02:17:03,179
figures like Jeff Bezos uh with blue
 

7365
02:17:03,179 --> 02:17:05,750
figures like Jeff Bezos uh with blue

origin or Elon Musk or SpaceX
 

7367
02:17:05,760 --> 02:17:07,429
origin or Elon Musk or SpaceX
there is

7368
02:17:07,429 --> 02:17:07,439
there is
 

7369
02:17:07,439 --> 02:17:10,429
there is
a science communication yeah to put it

7370
02:17:10,429 --> 02:17:10,439
a science communication yeah to put it
 

7371
02:17:10,439 --> 02:17:13,429
a science communication yeah to put it
uh in nice terms that's kind of required

7372
02:17:13,429 --> 02:17:13,439
uh in nice terms that's kind of required
 

7373
02:17:13,439 --> 02:17:15,709
uh in nice terms that's kind of required
to really educate the public and get

7374
02:17:15,709 --> 02:17:15,719
to really educate the public and get
 

7375
02:17:15,719 --> 02:17:17,929
to really educate the public and get
everybody excited and sell the sexiness

7376
02:17:17,929 --> 02:17:17,939
everybody excited and sell the sexiness
 

7377
02:17:17,939 --> 02:17:19,849
everybody excited and sell the sexiness
of it I mean just even the videos of

7378
02:17:19,849 --> 02:17:19,859
of it I mean just even the videos of
 

7379
02:17:19,859 --> 02:17:22,190
of it I mean just even the videos of
SpaceX just being able to kind of get

7380
02:17:22,190 --> 02:17:22,200
SpaceX just being able to kind of get
 

7381
02:17:22,200 --> 02:17:24,110
SpaceX just being able to kind of get
everybody excited about going out to

7382
02:17:24,110 --> 02:17:24,120
everybody excited about going out to
 

7383
02:17:24,120 --> 02:17:25,790
everybody excited about going out to
space once again I mean there's all

7384
02:17:25,790 --> 02:17:25,800
space once again I mean there's all
 

7385
02:17:25,800 --> 02:17:26,929
space once again I mean there's all
kinds of different ways of doing that

7386
02:17:26,929 --> 02:17:26,939
kinds of different ways of doing that
 

7387
02:17:26,939 --> 02:17:28,849
kinds of different ways of doing that
but part I mean I guess most of the

7388
02:17:28,849 --> 02:17:28,859
but part I mean I guess most of the
 

7389
02:17:28,859 --> 02:17:30,889
but part I mean I guess most of the
companies do well you know is is to

7390
02:17:30,889 --> 02:17:30,899
companies do well you know is is to
 

7391
02:17:30,899 --> 02:17:32,389
companies do well you know is is to
advertise themselves to really sell

7392
02:17:32,389 --> 02:17:32,399
advertise themselves to really sell
 

7393
02:17:32,399 --> 02:17:34,310
advertise themselves to really sell
themselves it is yeah well actually it's

7394
02:17:34,310 --> 02:17:34,320
themselves it is yeah well actually it's
 

7395
02:17:34,320 --> 02:17:36,830
themselves it is yeah well actually it's
like I feel like one of the reasons on

7396
02:17:36,830 --> 02:17:36,840
like I feel like one of the reasons on
 

7397
02:17:36,840 --> 02:17:40,070
like I feel like one of the reasons on
this podcast and so like I I don't have

7398
02:17:40,070 --> 02:17:40,080
this podcast and so like I I don't have
 

7399
02:17:40,080 --> 02:17:42,349
this podcast and so like I I don't have
an official role in the company and one

7400
02:17:42,349 --> 02:17:42,359
an official role in the company and one
 

7401
02:17:42,359 --> 02:17:45,650
an official role in the company and one
of the reasons for for this was also

7402
02:17:45,650 --> 02:17:45,660
of the reasons for for this was also
 

7403
02:17:45,660 --> 02:17:47,570
of the reasons for for this was also
that it's interesting because when you

7404
02:17:47,570 --> 02:17:47,580
that it's interesting because when you
 

7405
02:17:47,580 --> 02:17:49,190
that it's interesting because when you
come from like you're running a company

7406
02:17:49,190 --> 02:17:49,200
come from like you're running a company
 

7407
02:17:49,200 --> 02:17:51,410
come from like you're running a company
it's it makes sense they're promoting

7408
02:17:51,410 --> 02:17:51,420
it's it makes sense they're promoting
 

7409
02:17:51,420 --> 02:17:52,969
it's it makes sense they're promoting
their own product and their own Vision

7410
02:17:52,969 --> 02:17:52,979
their own product and their own Vision
 

7411
02:17:52,979 --> 02:17:55,370
their own product and their own Vision
which totally makes sense but there's

7412
02:17:55,370 --> 02:17:55,380
which totally makes sense but there's
 

7413
02:17:55,380 --> 02:17:58,070
which totally makes sense but there's
also a very important role for academics

7414
02:17:58,070 --> 02:17:58,080
also a very important role for academics
 

7415
02:17:58,080 --> 02:18:00,830
also a very important role for academics
who have knowledge about what's going on

7416
02:18:00,830 --> 02:18:00,840
who have knowledge about what's going on
 

7417
02:18:00,840 --> 02:18:03,589
who have knowledge about what's going on
but are sufficiently distant from it

7418
02:18:03,589 --> 02:18:03,599
but are sufficiently distant from it
 

7419
02:18:03,599 --> 02:18:05,330
but are sufficiently distant from it
that they're not fully only so

7420
02:18:05,330 --> 02:18:05,340
that they're not fully only so
 

7421
02:18:05,340 --> 02:18:07,669
that they're not fully only so
self-motivated just by their own you

7422
02:18:07,669 --> 02:18:07,679
self-motivated just by their own you
 

7423
02:18:07,679 --> 02:18:09,950
self-motivated just by their own you
know projects or so forth and for me

7424
02:18:09,950 --> 02:18:09,960
know projects or so forth and for me
 

7425
02:18:09,960 --> 02:18:13,490
know projects or so forth and for me
this is I mean we we see particularly

7426
02:18:13,490 --> 02:18:13,500
this is I mean we we see particularly
 

7427
02:18:13,500 --> 02:18:15,349
this is I mean we we see particularly
the problems of the distrust in

7428
02:18:15,349 --> 02:18:15,359
the problems of the distrust in
 

7429
02:18:15,359 --> 02:18:17,270
the problems of the distrust in
technology

7430
02:18:17,270 --> 02:18:17,280
technology
 

7431
02:18:17,280 --> 02:18:18,889
technology
um and then honestly in the scientific

7432
02:18:18,889 --> 02:18:18,899
um and then honestly in the scientific
 

7433
02:18:18,899 --> 02:18:22,549
um and then honestly in the scientific
Community as well too it will be that

7434
02:18:22,549 --> 02:18:22,559
Community as well too it will be that
 

7435
02:18:22,559 --> 02:18:24,530
Community as well too it will be that
one of the greatest tragedies I would

7436
02:18:24,530 --> 02:18:24,540
one of the greatest tragedies I would
 

7437
02:18:24,540 --> 02:18:26,750
one of the greatest tragedies I would
say that if we go through all of this

7438
02:18:26,750 --> 02:18:26,760
say that if we go through all of this
 

7439
02:18:26,760 --> 02:18:28,969
say that if we go through all of this
and almost pull off what looks like a

7440
02:18:28,969 --> 02:18:28,979
and almost pull off what looks like a
 

7441
02:18:28,979 --> 02:18:31,370
and almost pull off what looks like a
miracle like Technologic and scientific

7442
02:18:31,370 --> 02:18:31,380
miracle like Technologic and scientific
 

7443
02:18:31,380 --> 02:18:33,169
miracle like Technologic and scientific
wise which is to make a fusion power

7444
02:18:33,169 --> 02:18:33,179
wise which is to make a fusion power
 

7445
02:18:33,179 --> 02:18:35,929
wise which is to make a fusion power
plant and then nobody wants to use it

7446
02:18:35,929 --> 02:18:35,939
plant and then nobody wants to use it
 

7447
02:18:35,939 --> 02:18:38,389
plant and then nobody wants to use it
because they feel that they don't trust

7448
02:18:38,389 --> 02:18:38,399
because they feel that they don't trust
 

7449
02:18:38,399 --> 02:18:40,429
because they feel that they don't trust
the people who are doing it or the

7450
02:18:40,429 --> 02:18:40,439
the people who are doing it or the
 

7451
02:18:40,439 --> 02:18:43,429
the people who are doing it or the
technology so we have to get so far out

7452
02:18:43,429 --> 02:18:43,439
technology so we have to get so far out
 

7453
02:18:43,439 --> 02:18:46,129
technology so we have to get so far out
ahead of this like so I give lots of

7454
02:18:46,129 --> 02:18:46,139
ahead of this like so I give lots of
 

7455
02:18:46,139 --> 02:18:48,530
ahead of this like so I give lots of
public lectures or things like this of

7456
02:18:48,530 --> 02:18:48,540
public lectures or things like this of
 

7457
02:18:48,540 --> 02:18:51,230
public lectures or things like this of
of accessing a larger range of people

7458
02:18:51,230 --> 02:18:51,240
of accessing a larger range of people
 

7459
02:18:51,240 --> 02:18:53,629
of accessing a larger range of people

7463
02:18:55,859 --> 02:18:57,889
can come and see you know come do tours
of our laboratory in fact I want to set

7464
02:18:57,889 --> 02:18:57,899
of our laboratory in fact I want to set
 

7465
02:18:57,899 --> 02:18:59,509
of our laboratory in fact I want to set
those up virtually as well too you might

7466
02:18:59,509 --> 02:18:59,519
those up virtually as well too you might
 

7467
02:18:59,519 --> 02:19:02,150
those up virtually as well too you might
look at our plasma size infusion center

7468
02:19:02,150 --> 02:19:02,160
look at our plasma size infusion center
 

7469
02:19:02,160 --> 02:19:03,889
look at our plasma size infusion center
YouTube channel so we are reaching out

7470
02:19:03,889 --> 02:19:03,899
YouTube channel so we are reaching out
 

7471
02:19:03,899 --> 02:19:05,629
YouTube channel so we are reaching out
through those meetings and it's really

7472
02:19:05,629 --> 02:19:05,639
through those meetings and it's really
 

7473
02:19:05,639 --> 02:19:07,790
through those meetings and it's really
important that we do those things but

7474
02:19:07,790 --> 02:19:07,800
important that we do those things but
 

7475
02:19:07,800 --> 02:19:09,709
important that we do those things but
it's also but also then realizing

7476
02:19:09,709 --> 02:19:09,719
it's also but also then realizing
 

7477
02:19:09,719 --> 02:19:11,870
it's also but also then realizing
setting up the realistic expectations of

7478
02:19:11,870 --> 02:19:11,880
setting up the realistic expectations of
 

7479
02:19:11,880 --> 02:19:14,450
setting up the realistic expectations of
what we need to do you know we're not

7480
02:19:14,450 --> 02:19:14,460
what we need to do you know we're not
 

7481
02:19:14,460 --> 02:19:16,190
what we need to do you know we're not
there like we don't have commercial

7482
02:19:16,190 --> 02:19:16,200
there like we don't have commercial
 

7483
02:19:16,200 --> 02:19:18,169
there like we don't have commercial
Fusion devices yet and you ask like what

7484
02:19:18,169 --> 02:19:18,179
Fusion devices yet and you ask like what
 

7485
02:19:18,179 --> 02:19:19,669
Fusion devices yet and you ask like what
are the challenges

7486
02:19:19,669 --> 02:19:19,679
are the challenges
 

7487
02:19:19,679 --> 02:19:21,530
are the challenges
I'm not going to get in into any deep

7488
02:19:21,530 --> 02:19:21,540
I'm not going to get in into any deep
 

7489
02:19:21,540 --> 02:19:23,270
I'm not going to get in into any deep
technical you know questions about what

7490
02:19:23,270 --> 02:19:23,280
technical you know questions about what
 

7491
02:19:23,280 --> 02:19:27,230
technical you know questions about what
the challenges are but it is it the

7492
02:19:27,230 --> 02:19:27,240
the challenges are but it is it the
 

7493
02:19:27,240 --> 02:19:30,650
the challenges are but it is it the
pathway not just to make fusion work

7494
02:19:30,650 --> 02:19:30,660
pathway not just to make fusion work
 

7495
02:19:30,660 --> 02:19:33,049
pathway not just to make fusion work
technically but to make it economically

7496
02:19:33,049 --> 02:19:33,059
technically but to make it economically
 

7497
02:19:33,059 --> 02:19:35,089
technically but to make it economically
competitive and viable so it is actually

7498
02:19:35,089 --> 02:19:35,099
competitive and viable so it is actually
 

7499
02:19:35,099 --> 02:19:37,429
competitive and viable so it is actually
used out in the private sector is a

7500
02:19:37,429 --> 02:19:37,439
used out in the private sector is a
 

7501
02:19:37,439 --> 02:19:40,610
used out in the private sector is a
non-trivial task and it's because of the

7502
02:19:40,610 --> 02:19:40,620
non-trivial task and it's because of the
 

7503
02:19:40,620 --> 02:19:43,669
non-trivial task and it's because of the
newness of it like we're simultaneously

7504
02:19:43,669 --> 02:19:43,679
newness of it like we're simultaneously
 

7505
02:19:43,679 --> 02:19:46,790
newness of it like we're simultaneously
trying to evolve the technology and make

7506
02:19:46,790 --> 02:19:46,800
trying to evolve the technology and make
 

7507
02:19:46,800 --> 02:19:48,889
trying to evolve the technology and make
it economically viable at the same time

7508
02:19:48,889 --> 02:19:48,899
it economically viable at the same time
 

7509
02:19:48,899 --> 02:19:53,389
it economically viable at the same time
those are two difficult couple tasks so

7510
02:19:53,389 --> 02:19:53,399
those are two difficult couple tasks so
 

7511
02:19:53,399 --> 02:19:56,510
those are two difficult couple tasks so
my own my own research and my own drive

7512
02:19:56,510 --> 02:19:56,520
my own my own research and my own drive
 

7513

Fusion systems is set up we have a

7516
02:20:01,070 --> 02:20:01,080
Fusion systems is set up we have a
 

7517
02:20:01,080 --> 02:20:02,870
Fusion systems is set up we have a
commercialization unit of that

7518
02:20:02,870 --> 02:20:02,880

kinds of challenges and economic

7532
02:20:15,770 --> 02:20:15,780
kinds of challenges and economic
 

7533
02:20:15,780 --> 02:20:18,230
kinds of challenges and economic
advantages but what we have to I know

7534
02:20:18,230 --> 02:20:18,240
advantages but what we have to I know
 

7535
02:20:18,240 --> 02:20:19,610
advantages but what we have to I know
what we have to have what we have to

7536
02:20:19,610 --> 02:20:19,620
what we have to have what we have to
 

7537
02:20:19,620 --> 02:20:23,870
what we have to have what we have to
have is a new generation of integrated

7538
02:20:23,870 --> 02:20:23,880
have is a new generation of integrated
 

7539
02:20:23,880 --> 02:20:26,150
have is a new generation of integrated
scientists technologists and Engineers

7540
02:20:26,150 --> 02:20:26,160
scientists technologists and Engineers
 

7541
02:20:26,160 --> 02:20:28,670
scientists technologists and Engineers
that understand like how what needs to

7542
02:20:28,670 --> 02:20:28,680
that understand like how what needs to
 

7543
02:20:28,680 --> 02:20:30,590
that understand like how what needs to
get done to get all the way to the goal

7544
02:20:30,590 --> 02:20:30,600
get done to get all the way to the goal
 

7545
02:20:30,600 --> 02:20:32,330
get done to get all the way to the goal
line because we don't we don't have them

7546
02:20:32,330 --> 02:20:32,340
line because we don't we don't have them
 

7547
02:20:32,340 --> 02:20:33,889
line because we don't we don't have them
now like a multi-disciplinary yeah

7548
02:20:33,889 --> 02:20:33,899
now like a multi-disciplinary yeah
 

7549
02:20:33,899 --> 02:20:35,929
now like a multi-disciplinary yeah
exactly what's required I mean you've

7550
02:20:35,929 --> 02:20:35,939
exactly what's required I mean you've
 

7551
02:20:35,939 --> 02:20:39,349
exactly what's required I mean you've
spoken about uh you've said that Fusion

7552
02:20:39,349 --> 02:20:39,359
spoken about uh you've said that Fusion
 

7553
02:20:39,359 --> 02:20:41,650
spoken about uh you've said that Fusion
is quote the most

7554
02:20:41,650 --> 02:20:41,660
is quote the most
 

7555
02:20:41,660 --> 02:20:43,730
is quote the most
multi-disciplinary field you can imagine

7556
02:20:43,730 --> 02:20:43,740
multi-disciplinary field you can imagine
 

7557
02:20:43,740 --> 02:20:46,429
multi-disciplinary field you can imagine
yes yeah why why is that what are the

7558
02:20:46,429 --> 02:20:46,439
yes yeah why why is that what are the
 

7559
02:20:46,439 --> 02:20:48,349
yes yeah why why is that what are the
yeah well because because most of our

7560
02:20:48,349 --> 02:20:48,359
yeah well because because most of our
 

7561
02:20:48,359 --> 02:20:50,090
yeah well because because most of our
discussion that we've had so far is

7562
02:20:50,090 --> 02:20:50,100
discussion that we've had so far is
 

7563
02:20:50,100 --> 02:20:52,130
discussion that we've had so far is
really like a physics discussion really

7564
02:20:52,130 --> 02:20:52,140
really like a physics discussion really
 

7565
02:20:52,140 --> 02:20:53,889
really like a physics discussion really
so which don't don't

7566
02:20:53,889 --> 02:20:53,899
so which don't don't
 

7567
02:20:53,899 --> 02:20:56,570
so which don't don't
neglect physics is at the for origin of

7568
02:20:56,570 --> 02:20:56,580
neglect physics is at the for origin of
 

7569
02:20:56,580 --> 02:20:58,910
neglect physics is at the for origin of
this but I've already we touched on

7570
02:20:58,910 --> 02:20:58,920
this but I've already we touched on
 

7571
02:20:58,920 --> 02:21:01,490
this but I've already we touched on
plasma physics and nuclear physics which

7572
02:21:01,490 --> 02:21:01,500
plasma physics and nuclear physics which
 

7573
02:21:01,500 --> 02:21:03,889
plasma physics and nuclear physics which
are basically two you know somewhat

7574
02:21:03,889 --> 02:21:03,899
are basically two you know somewhat
 

7575
02:21:03,899 --> 02:21:06,349
are basically two you know somewhat
overlap but independent disciplines then

7576
02:21:06,349 --> 02:21:06,359
overlap but independent disciplines then
 

7577
02:21:06,359 --> 02:21:08,630
overlap but independent disciplines then
when it comes to the engineering it's

7578
02:21:08,630 --> 02:21:08,640
when it comes to the engineering it's
 

7579
02:21:08,640 --> 02:21:11,150
when it comes to the engineering it's
almost everything so so why is this well

7580
02:21:11,150 --> 02:21:11,160
almost everything so so why is this well
 

7581
02:21:11,160 --> 02:21:13,070
almost everything so so why is this well
let's build let's build an electromagnet

7582
02:21:13,070 --> 02:21:13,080
let's build let's build an electromagnet
 

7583
02:21:13,080 --> 02:21:14,990
let's build let's build an electromagnet
together okay what is this going to take

7584
02:21:14,990 --> 02:21:15,000
together okay what is this going to take
 

7585
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:16,309
together okay what is this going to take
it's going to take

7586
02:21:16,309 --> 02:21:16,319
it's going to take
 

7587
02:21:16,319 --> 02:21:18,170
it's going to take
um it's basically electrical engineering

7588
02:21:18,170 --> 02:21:18,180
um it's basically electrical engineering
 

7589
02:21:18,180 --> 02:21:19,849
um it's basically electrical engineering
computer and so you under understand

7590
02:21:19,849 --> 02:21:19,859
computer and so you under understand
 

7591
02:21:19,859 --> 02:21:22,010
computer and so you under understand
what how it goes together and what

7592
02:21:22,010 --> 02:21:22,020
what how it goes together and what
 

7593
02:21:22,020 --> 02:21:24,830
what how it goes together and what
happens computational engineering to

7594
02:21:24,830 --> 02:21:24,840
happens computational engineering to
 

7595
02:21:24,840 --> 02:21:27,110
happens computational engineering to
model this very complex integrated thing

7596
02:21:27,110 --> 02:21:27,120
model this very complex integrated thing
 

7597
02:21:27,120 --> 02:21:29,929
model this very complex integrated thing
materials engineering because it's this

7598
02:21:29,929 --> 02:21:29,939
materials engineering because it's this
 

7599
02:21:29,939 --> 02:21:32,090
materials engineering because it's this
you're pushing materials to their limit

7600
02:21:32,090 --> 02:21:32,100
you're pushing materials to their limit
 

7601
02:21:32,100 --> 02:21:33,889
you're pushing materials to their limit
with respect to stress and so forth

7602
02:21:33,889 --> 02:21:33,899
with respect to stress and so forth
 

7603
02:21:33,899 --> 02:21:35,929
with respect to stress and so forth
takes cryogenic engineering which is

7604
02:21:35,929 --> 02:21:35,939
takes cryogenic engineering which is
 

7605
02:21:35,939 --> 02:21:37,490
takes cryogenic engineering which is
sort of a sub-discipline but cooling

7606
02:21:37,490 --> 02:21:37,500
sort of a sub-discipline but cooling
 

7607
02:21:37,500 --> 02:21:38,870
sort of a sub-discipline but cooling
things to extremely low temperatures

7608
02:21:38,870 --> 02:21:38,880
things to extremely low temperatures
 

7609
02:21:38,880 --> 02:21:40,910
things to extremely low temperatures
probably some kind of chemistry thing in

7610
02:21:40,910 --> 02:21:40,920
probably some kind of chemistry thing in
 

7611
02:21:40,920 --> 02:21:43,190
probably some kind of chemistry thing in
there too well actually yeah which tends

7612
02:21:43,190 --> 02:21:43,200
there too well actually yeah which tends
 

7613
02:21:43,200 --> 02:21:44,630
there too well actually yeah which tends
to show up in the materials and that's

7614
02:21:44,630 --> 02:21:44,640
to show up in the materials and that's
 

7615
02:21:44,640 --> 02:21:46,370
to show up in the materials and that's
just one of the sub components of it

7616
02:21:46,370 --> 02:21:46,380
just one of the sub components of it
 

7617
02:21:46,380 --> 02:21:49,070
just one of the sub components of it
like almost everything gets hit in this

7618
02:21:49,070 --> 02:21:49,080
like almost everything gets hit in this
 

7619
02:21:49,080 --> 02:21:51,230
like almost everything gets hit in this
right so you're and you're also in a

7620
02:21:51,230 --> 02:21:51,240
right so you're and you're also in a
 

7621
02:21:51,240 --> 02:21:53,330
right so you're and you're also in a
very integrated environment because in

7622
02:21:53,330 --> 02:21:53,340
very integrated environment because in
 

7623
02:21:53,340 --> 02:21:55,490
very integrated environment because in
the end all these things while you

7624
02:21:55,490 --> 02:21:55,500
the end all these things while you
 

7625
02:21:55,500 --> 02:21:57,349
the end all these things while you
isolate them from each other in a

7626
02:21:57,349 --> 02:21:57,359
isolate them from each other in a
 

7627
02:21:57,359 --> 02:21:59,150
isolate them from each other in a
physics sense in an engineering sense

7628
02:21:59,150 --> 02:21:59,160
physics sense in an engineering sense
 

7629
02:21:59,160 --> 02:22:01,370
physics sense in an engineering sense
they all have to work like seamlessly

7630
02:22:01,370 --> 02:22:01,380
they all have to work like seamlessly
 

7631
02:22:01,380 --> 02:22:05,450
they all have to work like seamlessly
together so it's one of those I mean in

7632
02:22:05,450 --> 02:22:05,460
together so it's one of those I mean in
 

7633
02:22:05,460 --> 02:22:07,550
together so it's one of those I mean in
my own career I've basically done Atomic

7634
02:22:07,550 --> 02:22:07,560
my own career I've basically done Atomic
 

7635
02:22:07,560 --> 02:22:08,650
my own career I've basically done Atomic
physics

7636
02:22:08,650 --> 02:22:08,660
physics
 

7637
02:22:08,660 --> 02:22:12,469
physics
spectroscopy you know plasma physics uh

7638
02:22:12,469 --> 02:22:12,479
spectroscopy you know plasma physics uh
 

7639
02:22:12,479 --> 02:22:14,450
spectroscopy you know plasma physics uh
iron etching

7640
02:22:14,450 --> 02:22:14,460
iron etching
 

7641
02:22:14,460 --> 02:22:15,070
iron etching
um

7642
02:22:15,070 --> 02:22:15,080
um
 

7643
02:22:15,080 --> 02:22:18,650

Fusion you're not paying attention

7662
02:22:37,610 --> 02:22:37,620
Fusion you're not paying attention
 

7663
02:22:37,620 --> 02:22:39,170
Fusion you're not paying attention
because there's always something

7664
02:22:39,170 --> 02:22:39,180
because there's always something
 

7665
02:22:39,180 --> 02:22:42,650
because there's always something
interesting to go and and do so that's a

interesting to go and and do so that's a
 

7667
02:22:42,660 --> 02:22:44,690
interesting to go and and do so that's a
really important uh part of what we're

02:22:44,690 --> 02:22:44,700
really important uh part of what we're
 

7669
02:22:44,700 --> 02:22:46,429
really important uh part of what we're
what we're doing which isn't new in

what we're doing which isn't new in
 

7671
02:22:46,439 --> 02:22:48,530
what we're doing which isn't new in
Fusion actually and in fact is in the

Fusion actually and in fact is in the
 

7673
02:22:48,540 --> 02:22:51,170

holy cow like the proximity

7676
02:22:53,570 --> 02:22:53,580
holy cow like the proximity
 

7677
02:22:53,580 --> 02:22:56,270
holy cow like the proximity
of of possibility of commercial Fusion

7678
02:22:56,270 --> 02:22:56,280
of of possibility of commercial Fusion
 

7679
02:22:56,280 --> 02:22:58,250
of of possibility of commercial Fusion
is the new thing you know so my

7680
02:22:58,250 --> 02:22:58,260
is the new thing you know so my
 

7681
02:22:58,260 --> 02:23:00,770
is the new thing you know so my
catchphrases like you might be wondering

catchphrases like you might be wondering
 

7683
02:23:00,780 --> 02:23:02,150
catchphrases like you might be wondering
like why aren't we doing all these

7684
02:23:02,150 --> 02:23:02,160
like why aren't we doing all these
 

7685
02:23:02,160 --> 02:23:03,590
like why aren't we doing all these
things like why weren't we pushing

02:23:03,590 --> 02:23:03,600
things like why weren't we pushing
 

7687
02:23:03,600 --> 02:23:05,210
things like why weren't we pushing
towards economic fusion and new

7688
02:23:05,210 --> 02:23:05,220
towards economic fusion and new
 

7689
02:23:05,220 --> 02:23:07,309
towards economic fusion and new
materials and new methods of heat

7690
02:23:07,309 --> 02:23:07,319
materials and new methods of heat
 

7691
02:23:07,319 --> 02:23:08,870

everybody knew Fusion was 40 years away

7694
02:23:11,870 --> 02:23:11,880
everybody knew Fusion was 40 years away
 

7695
02:23:11,880 --> 02:23:15,110
everybody knew Fusion was 40 years away
and now it's four years away there is a

7696
02:23:15,110 --> 02:23:15,120
and now it's four years away there is a
 

7697
02:23:15,120 --> 02:23:17,030
and now it's four years away there is a
history like you said 40 30 whatever

7698
02:23:17,030 --> 02:23:17,040
history like you said 40 30 whatever
 

7699
02:23:17,040 --> 02:23:20,690
history like you said 40 30 whatever
that kind of old joke uh there's a

7700
02:23:20,690 --> 02:23:20,700
that kind of old joke uh there's a
 

7701
02:23:20,700 --> 02:23:22,389
that kind of old joke uh there's a
history of fusion projects

7702
02:23:22,389 --> 02:23:22,399
history of fusion projects
 

7703
02:23:22,399 --> 02:23:25,190
history of fusion projects
that you know are characterized by cost

7704
02:23:25,190 --> 02:23:25,200
that you know are characterized by cost
 

7705
02:23:25,200 --> 02:23:27,710

overruns and delays

7706
02:23:27,710 --> 02:23:27,720
overruns and delays
 

7707
02:23:27,720 --> 02:23:29,270
overruns and delays
um how do you avoid this how do you

7708
02:23:29,270 --> 02:23:29,280
um how do you avoid this how do you
 

7709
02:23:29,280 --> 02:23:31,010
um how do you avoid this how do you
minimize the chance of this you have to

7710
02:23:31,010 --> 02:23:31,020
minimize the chance of this you have to
 

7711
02:23:31,020 --> 02:23:32,929
minimize the chance of this you have to
build great teams

7712
02:23:32,929 --> 02:23:32,939
build great teams
 

7713
02:23:32,939 --> 02:23:35,929
build great teams
um uh is one of them it tends to be that

7714
02:23:35,929 --> 02:23:35,939
um uh is one of them it tends to be that
 

7715
02:23:35,939 --> 02:23:38,929
um uh is one of them it tends to be that
the smaller the there's sort of like I'm

7716
02:23:38,929 --> 02:23:38,939
the smaller the there's sort of like I'm
 

7717
02:23:38,939 --> 02:23:40,910
the smaller the there's sort of like I'm
not an expert in this but I've seen this

7718
02:23:40,910 --> 02:23:40,920
not an expert in this but I've seen this
 

7719
02:23:40,920 --> 02:23:42,950
not an expert in this but I've seen this
enough integrated certain equations yeah

7720
02:23:42,950 --> 02:23:42,960
enough integrated certain equations yeah
 

7721
02:23:42,960 --> 02:23:45,050
enough integrated certain equations yeah
well there's almost there's there's I've

7722
02:23:45,050 --> 02:23:45,060
well there's almost there's there's I've
 

7723
02:23:45,060 --> 02:23:46,309
well there's almost there's there's I've
seen this from enough teams like I've

7724
02:23:46,309 --> 02:23:46,319
seen this from enough teams like I've
 

7725
02:23:46,319 --> 02:23:48,830
seen this from enough teams like I've
seen also the futility of Lone Geniuses

7726
02:23:48,830 --> 02:23:48,840
seen also the futility of Lone Geniuses
 

7727
02:23:48,840 --> 02:23:50,330
seen also the futility of Lone Geniuses
trying to solve everything by themselves

7728
02:23:50,330 --> 02:23:50,340
trying to solve everything by themselves
 

7729
02:23:50,340 --> 02:23:53,090
trying to solve everything by themselves
like no but also organizations that have

7730
02:23:53,090 --> 02:23:53,100
like no but also organizations that have
 

7731
02:23:53,100 --> 02:23:55,490
like no but also organizations that have
10 000 people in them is is just not

7732
02:23:55,490 --> 02:23:55,500
10 000 people in them is is just not
 

7733
02:23:55,500 --> 02:23:57,530
10 000 people in them is is just not
doesn't lend itself at all to Innovation

7734
02:23:57,530 --> 02:23:57,540
doesn't lend itself at all to Innovation
 

7735
02:23:57,540 --> 02:24:00,290
doesn't lend itself at all to Innovation
so like one of our original sponsors and

7736
02:24:00,290 --> 02:24:00,300
so like one of our original sponsors and
 

7737
02:24:00,300 --> 02:24:01,730
so like one of our original sponsors and
a good friend vinod Coast I don't know

7738
02:24:01,730 --> 02:24:01,740
a good friend vinod Coast I don't know
 

7739
02:24:01,740 --> 02:24:02,750
a good friend vinod Coast I don't know
if you've ever talked to the node

7740
02:24:02,750 --> 02:24:02,760
if you've ever talked to the node
 

7741
02:24:02,760 --> 02:24:04,969
if you've ever talked to the node
Coastal he's a venture guy he's got

7742
02:24:04,969 --> 02:24:04,979
Coastal he's a venture guy he's got
 

7743
02:24:04,979 --> 02:24:07,190
Coastal he's a venture guy he's got
fantastic ideas about like the right

7744
02:24:07,190 --> 02:24:07,200
fantastic ideas about like the right
 

7745
02:24:07,200 --> 02:24:09,469
fantastic ideas about like the right
sizes of teams and things that really

7746
02:24:09,469 --> 02:24:09,479
sizes of teams and things that really
 

7747
02:24:09,479 --> 02:24:11,870
sizes of teams and things that really
innovate right and and there is an

7748
02:24:11,870 --> 02:24:11,880
innovate right and and there is an
 

7749
02:24:11,880 --> 02:24:13,670
innovate right and and there is an
Optimum place in there is that you get

7750
02:24:13,670 --> 02:24:13,680
Optimum place in there is that you get
 

7751
02:24:13,680 --> 02:24:16,010
Optimum place in there is that you get
enough cross-discipline and ideas but it

7752
02:24:16,010 --> 02:24:16,020
enough cross-discipline and ideas but it
 

7753
02:24:16,020 --> 02:24:17,750
enough cross-discipline and ideas but it
doesn't become so overly bureaucratic

7754
02:24:17,750 --> 02:24:17,760
doesn't become so overly bureaucratic
 

7755
02:24:17,760 --> 02:24:20,990
doesn't become so overly bureaucratic
that you can't execute on it so so one

7756
02:24:20,990 --> 02:24:21,000
that you can't execute on it so so one
 

7757
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:22,250
that you can't execute on it so so one
of the ways and this was one of the

7758
02:24:22,250 --> 02:24:22,260
of the ways and this was one of the
 

7759
02:24:22,260 --> 02:24:24,170
of the ways and this was one of the
challenges of fusion is that everything

7760
02:24:24,170 --> 02:24:24,180
challenges of fusion is that everything
 

7761
02:24:24,180 --> 02:24:27,230
challenges of fusion is that everything
was leading towards like I have to have

7762
02:24:27,230 --> 02:24:27,240
was leading towards like I have to have
 

7763
02:24:27,240 --> 02:24:30,590
was leading towards like I have to have
like ex enormously large like teams just

7764
02:24:30,590 --> 02:24:30,600
like ex enormously large like teams just
 

7765
02:24:30,600 --> 02:24:32,389
like ex enormously large like teams just
to execute because of the scale of the

7766
02:24:32,389 --> 02:24:32,399
to execute because of the scale of the
 

7767
02:24:32,399 --> 02:24:35,090
to execute because of the scale of the
project the fact that now through

7768
02:24:35,090 --> 02:24:35,100
project the fact that now through
 

7769
02:24:35,100 --> 02:24:37,250
project the fact that now through
technology through both technology and

7770
02:24:37,250 --> 02:24:37,260
technology through both technology and
 

7771
02:24:37,260 --> 02:24:40,429
technology through both technology and
the argue financing Innovation we're

7772
02:24:40,429 --> 02:24:40,439
the argue financing Innovation we're
 

7773
02:24:40,439 --> 02:24:42,530
the argue financing Innovation we're
driving to the point where it's smaller

7774
02:24:42,530 --> 02:24:42,540
driving to the point where it's smaller
 

7775
02:24:42,540 --> 02:24:44,389
driving to the point where it's smaller
focused teams about doing those things

7776
02:24:44,389 --> 02:24:44,399
focused teams about doing those things
 

7777
02:24:44,399 --> 02:24:46,910
focused teams about doing those things
so that's one way to make it faster the

7778
02:24:46,910 --> 02:24:46,920
so that's one way to make it faster the
 

7779
02:24:46,920 --> 02:24:48,230
so that's one way to make it faster the
other way to make it faster is

7780
02:24:48,230 --> 02:24:48,240
other way to make it faster is
 

7781
02:24:48,240 --> 02:24:50,809
other way to make it faster is
modularize the problem or parse the

7782
02:24:50,809 --> 02:24:50,819
modularize the problem or parse the
 

7783
02:24:50,819 --> 02:24:52,969
modularize the problem or parse the
problem so this is the other difficulty

7784
02:24:52,969 --> 02:24:52,979
problem so this is the other difficulty
 

7785
02:24:52,979 --> 02:24:55,849
problem so this is the other difficulty
infusion is that it you know you tend to

7786
02:24:55,849 --> 02:24:55,859
infusion is that it you know you tend to
 

7787
02:24:55,859 --> 02:24:57,230
infusion is that it you know you tend to
look at this that's like oh it's it's

7788
02:24:57,230 --> 02:24:57,240
look at this that's like oh it's it's
 

7789
02:24:57,240 --> 02:24:59,389
look at this that's like oh it's it's
really just about making the plasma into

7790
02:24:59,389 --> 02:24:59,399
really just about making the plasma into
 

7791
02:24:59,399 --> 02:25:01,190
really just about making the plasma into
this state you know here that you get

7792
02:25:01,190 --> 02:25:01,200
this state you know here that you get
 

7793
02:25:01,200 --> 02:25:04,490
this state you know here that you get
this energy gain no because in the end

7794
02:25:04,490 --> 02:25:04,500
this energy gain no because in the end
 

7795
02:25:04,500 --> 02:25:06,469
this energy gain no because in the end
if you can parse out the different

7796
02:25:06,469 --> 02:25:06,479
if you can parse out the different
 

7797
02:25:06,479 --> 02:25:08,809
if you can parse out the different
problems of making that and then make it

7798
02:25:08,809 --> 02:25:08,819
problems of making that and then make it
 

7799
02:25:08,819 --> 02:25:10,490
problems of making that and then make it
as separate as possible from extracting

7800
02:25:10,490 --> 02:25:10,500
as separate as possible from extracting
 

7801
02:25:10,500 --> 02:25:12,050
as separate as possible from extracting
the energy and then converting it into

7802
02:25:12,050 --> 02:25:12,060
the energy and then converting it into
 

7803
02:25:12,060 --> 02:25:13,670
the energy and then converting it into
electricity the more separate those are

7804
02:25:13,670 --> 02:25:13,680
electricity the more separate those are
 

7805
02:25:13,680 --> 02:25:15,410
electricity the more separate those are
the better they are because you get

7806
02:25:15,410 --> 02:25:15,420
the better they are because you get
 

7807
02:25:15,420 --> 02:25:17,330
the better they are because you get
parallel pass that basically mitigate

7808
02:25:17,330 --> 02:25:17,340
parallel pass that basically mitigate
 

7809
02:25:17,340 --> 02:25:19,370
parallel pass that basically mitigate
risk this is not new infusion by the way

7810
02:25:19,370 --> 02:25:19,380
risk this is not new infusion by the way
 

7811
02:25:19,380 --> 02:25:21,410
risk this is not new infusion by the way
and this is the way that we attack most

7812
02:25:21,410 --> 02:25:21,420
and this is the way that we attack most
 

7813
02:25:21,420 --> 02:25:23,750
and this is the way that we attack most

for controlling nuclear fusion yeah um
do you find those kinds of I guess you

7834
02:25:45,469 --> 02:25:45,479
do you find those kinds of I guess you
 

7835
02:25:45,479 --> 02:25:46,670
do you find those kinds of I guess you
throw them under the umbrella of

7836
02:25:46,670 --> 02:25:46,680
throw them under the umbrella of
 

7837
02:25:46,680 --> 02:25:48,889
throw them under the umbrella of
computational modeling do you find those

7838
02:25:48,889 --> 02:25:48,899
computational modeling do you find those
 

7839
02:25:48,899 --> 02:25:51,110
computational modeling do you find those
interesting promising directions they're

7840
02:25:51,110 --> 02:25:51,120
interesting promising directions they're
 

7841
02:25:51,120 --> 02:25:52,429
interesting promising directions they're
all they're all interesting so when

7842
02:25:52,429 --> 02:25:52,439
all they're all interesting so when
 

7843
02:25:52,439 --> 02:25:56,389
all they're all interesting so when
people you know I'll pull back maybe a a

7844
02:25:56,389 --> 02:25:56,399
people you know I'll pull back maybe a a
 

7845
02:25:56,399 --> 02:25:58,190
people you know I'll pull back maybe a a
natural question is like why is it

7846
02:25:58,190 --> 02:25:58,200
natural question is like why is it
 

7847
02:25:58,200 --> 02:25:59,570
natural question is like why is it
different in Fusion like there's a long

7848
02:25:59,570 --> 02:25:59,580
different in Fusion like there's a long
 

7849
02:25:59,580 --> 02:26:01,490
different in Fusion like there's a long
history diffusion right it was going on

7850
02:26:01,490 --> 02:26:01,500
history diffusion right it was going on
 

7851
02:26:01,500 --> 02:26:03,170
history diffusion right it was going on
for like I told you like stories from

7852
02:26:03,170 --> 02:26:03,180
for like I told you like stories from
 

7853
02:26:03,180 --> 02:26:05,690
for like I told you like stories from
the late 1960s like what's different now

7854
02:26:05,690 --> 02:26:05,700
the late 1960s like what's different now
 

7855
02:26:05,700 --> 02:26:08,990
the late 1960s like what's different now
right so I I think from the from the

7856
02:26:08,990 --> 02:26:09,000
right so I I think from the from the
 

7857
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:10,730
right so I I think from the from the
technology point of view there's two

7858
02:26:10,730 --> 02:26:10,740
technology point of view there's two
 

7859
02:26:10,740 --> 02:26:12,230
technology point of view there's two
massive things which are different so

7860
02:26:12,230 --> 02:26:12,240
massive things which are different so
 

7861
02:26:12,240 --> 02:26:13,969
massive things which are different so
one of them you know I'll be parochial

7862
02:26:13,969 --> 02:26:13,979
one of them you know I'll be parochial
 

7863
02:26:13,979 --> 02:26:15,469
one of them you know I'll be parochial
it's the Advent of this new

7864
02:26:15,469 --> 02:26:15,479
it's the Advent of this new
 

7865
02:26:15,479 --> 02:26:17,809
it's the Advent of this new
superconducting materials because the

7866
02:26:17,809 --> 02:26:17,819
superconducting materials because the
 

7867
02:26:17,819 --> 02:26:19,849
superconducting materials because the
most mature ways that we understand

7868
02:26:19,849 --> 02:26:19,859
most mature ways that we understand
 

7869
02:26:19,859 --> 02:26:21,349
most mature ways that we understand
about how we're gonna get the fusion

7870
02:26:21,349 --> 02:26:21,359
about how we're gonna get the fusion
 

7871
02:26:21,359 --> 02:26:22,969
about how we're gonna get the fusion
power plants or magnetic fusion and by

7872
02:26:22,969 --> 02:26:22,979
power plants or magnetic fusion and by
 

7873
02:26:22,979 --> 02:26:24,950
power plants or magnetic fusion and by
the fact that you've got access to

7874
02:26:24,950 --> 02:26:24,960
the fact that you've got access to
 

7875
02:26:24,960 --> 02:26:26,870
the fact that you've got access to
something which like changes the

7876
02:26:26,870 --> 02:26:26,880
something which like changes the
 

7877
02:26:26,880 --> 02:26:29,210
something which like changes the
economic equation by an over and Order

7878
02:26:29,210 --> 02:26:29,220
economic equation by an over and Order
 

7879
02:26:29,220 --> 02:26:31,849
economic equation by an over and Order
magnitude is just a totally you know and

7880
02:26:31,849 --> 02:26:31,859
magnitude is just a totally you know and
 

7881
02:26:31,859 --> 02:26:33,650
magnitude is just a totally you know and
that that wasn't that long ago was only

7882
02:26:33,650 --> 02:26:33,660
that that wasn't that long ago was only
 

7883
02:26:33,660 --> 02:26:35,510
that that wasn't that long ago was only
September of 2021 we actually

7884
02:26:35,510 --> 02:26:35,520
September of 2021 we actually
 

7885
02:26:35,520 --> 02:26:37,670
September of 2021 we actually
demonstrated the technology that changes

7886
02:26:37,670 --> 02:26:37,680
demonstrated the technology that changes
 

7887
02:26:37,680 --> 02:26:40,070
demonstrated the technology that changes
the the prospects there and the other

7888
02:26:40,070 --> 02:26:40,080
the the prospects there and the other
 

7889
02:26:40,080 --> 02:26:42,410
the the prospects there and the other
one is Computing and it's across the

7890
02:26:42,410 --> 02:26:42,420
one is Computing and it's across the
 

7891
02:26:42,420 --> 02:26:44,630
one is Computing and it's across the
whole Spectrum it's not just in control

7892
02:26:44,630 --> 02:26:44,640
whole Spectrum it's not just in control
 

7893
02:26:44,640 --> 02:26:46,969
whole Spectrum it's not just in control
of the fusion device it's actually in in

7894
02:26:46,969 --> 02:26:46,979
of the fusion device it's actually in in
 

7895
02:26:46,979 --> 02:26:48,950
of the fusion device it's actually in in
the we actually use machine learning and

7896
02:26:48,950 --> 02:26:48,960
the we actually use machine learning and
 

7897
02:26:48,960 --> 02:26:50,389
the we actually use machine learning and
things like this in the design of the

7898
02:26:50,389 --> 02:26:50,399
things like this in the design of the
 

7899
02:26:50,399 --> 02:26:52,370
things like this in the design of the
magnet itself it's an incredibly complex

7900
02:26:52,370 --> 02:26:52,380
magnet itself it's an incredibly complex
 

7901
02:26:52,380 --> 02:26:55,969
magnet itself it's an incredibly complex
design space so you use those tools the

7902
02:26:55,969 --> 02:26:55,979
design space so you use those tools the
 

7903
02:26:55,979 --> 02:26:58,130
design space so you use those tools the
simulation of the plasma itself is

7904
02:26:58,130 --> 02:26:58,140
simulation of the plasma itself is
 

7905
02:26:58,140 --> 02:27:00,469
simulation of the plasma itself is
actually we're at a totally different

7906
02:27:00,469 --> 02:27:00,479
actually we're at a totally different
 

7907
02:27:00,479 --> 02:27:02,750
actually we're at a totally different
place than we were because of those

7908
02:27:02,750 --> 02:27:02,760
place than we were because of those
 

7909
02:27:02,760 --> 02:27:05,270
place than we were because of those
things so those are the two big drivers

7910
02:27:05,270 --> 02:27:05,280
things so those are the two big drivers
 

7911
02:27:05,280 --> 02:27:07,250
things so those are the two big drivers
that I see actually that make it

7912
02:27:07,250 --> 02:27:07,260
that I see actually that make it
 

7913
02:27:07,260 --> 02:27:09,650
that I see actually that make it
different uh and actually and it's

7914
02:27:09,650 --> 02:27:09,660
different uh and actually and it's
 

7915
02:27:09,660 --> 02:27:12,110
different uh and actually and it's
interesting both those things self

7916
02:27:12,110 --> 02:27:12,120
interesting both those things self
 

7917
02:27:12,120 --> 02:27:13,670
interesting both those things self
enforce about what you asked about

7918
02:27:13,670 --> 02:27:13,680
enforce about what you asked about
 

7919
02:27:13,680 --> 02:27:15,650
enforce about what you asked about
before like how do you avoid delays and

7920
02:27:15,650 --> 02:27:15,660
before like how do you avoid delays and
 

7921
02:27:15,660 --> 02:27:17,809
before like how do you avoid delays and
things well it's by having smaller teams

7922
02:27:17,809 --> 02:27:17,819
things well it's by having smaller teams
 

7923
02:27:17,819 --> 02:27:20,510
things well it's by having smaller teams
that can actually execute on those but

7924
02:27:20,510 --> 02:27:20,520
that can actually execute on those but
 

7925
02:27:20,520 --> 02:27:23,630
that can actually execute on those but
now you can do this because the new

7926
02:27:23,630 --> 02:27:23,640
now you can do this because the new
 

7927
02:27:23,640 --> 02:27:26,450
now you can do this because the new
magnets make the devices all smaller and

7928
02:27:26,450 --> 02:27:26,460
magnets make the devices all smaller and
 

7929
02:27:26,460 --> 02:27:28,490
magnets make the devices all smaller and
the Computing means your Cuban

7930
02:27:28,490 --> 02:27:28,500
the Computing means your Cuban
 

7931
02:27:28,500 --> 02:27:30,710
the Computing means your Cuban
Effectiveness about exploring the

7932
02:27:30,710 --> 02:27:30,720
Effectiveness about exploring the
 

7933
02:27:30,720 --> 02:27:32,570
Effectiveness about exploring the
optimization space is way better it's

7934
02:27:32,570 --> 02:27:32,580
optimization space is way better it's
 

7935
02:27:32,580 --> 02:27:34,370
optimization space is way better it's
like they're all Interlink to each other

7936
02:27:34,370 --> 02:27:34,380
like they're all Interlink to each other
 

7937
02:27:34,380 --> 02:27:36,050
like they're all Interlink to each other
plus the modularization like you said

7938
02:27:36,050 --> 02:27:36,060
plus the modularization like you said
 

7939
02:27:36,060 --> 02:27:37,490
plus the modularization like you said
and so everything just kind of works

7940
02:27:37,490 --> 02:27:37,500
and so everything just kind of works
 

7941
02:27:37,500 --> 02:27:39,170
and so everything just kind of works
together to make smaller teams more

7942
02:27:39,170 --> 02:27:39,180
together to make smaller teams more
 

7943
02:27:39,180 --> 02:27:40,849
together to make smaller teams more
effective move faster and it's actually

7944
02:27:40,849 --> 02:27:40,859
effective move faster and it's actually
 

7945
02:27:40,859 --> 02:27:42,770
effective move faster and it's actually
and it's through that learned experience

7946
02:27:42,770 --> 02:27:42,780
and it's through that learned experience
 

7947
02:27:42,780 --> 02:27:44,990
and it's through that learned experience
I mean you know of the things that I'm

7948
02:27:44,990 --> 02:27:45,000
I mean you know of the things that I'm
 

7949
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:47,030
I mean you know of the things that I'm
the most proud of about what came out in

7950
02:27:47,030 --> 02:27:47,040
the most proud of about what came out in
 

7951
02:27:47,040 --> 02:27:49,190
the most proud of about what came out in
fact the origins of thinking about how

7952
02:27:49,190 --> 02:27:49,200
fact the origins of thinking about how
 

7953
02:27:49,200 --> 02:27:51,530
fact the origins of thinking about how
we would use the the the high

02:27:51,530 --> 02:27:51,540
we would use the the the high
 

7955
02:27:51,540 --> 02:27:53,570
we would use the the the high
temperature superconducting magnets came

7956
02:27:53,570 --> 02:27:53,580
temperature superconducting magnets came
 

7957
02:27:53,580 --> 02:27:57,230
temperature superconducting magnets came
out of my design class at MIT and in the

7958
02:27:57,230 --> 02:27:57,240
out of my design class at MIT and in the
 

7959
02:27:57,240 --> 02:27:58,910
out of my design class at MIT and in the
design class like one of the features

7960
02:27:58,910 --> 02:27:58,920
design class like one of the features
 

7961
02:27:58,920 --> 02:28:00,650
design class like one of the features
that I kept I mean it was interesting I

7962
02:28:00,650 --> 02:28:00,660
that I kept I mean it was interesting I
 

7963
02:28:00,660 --> 02:28:02,389
that I kept I mean it was interesting I
actually learned I really learned along

7964
02:28:02,389 --> 02:28:02,399
actually learned I really learned along
 

7965
02:28:02,399 --> 02:28:04,429
actually learned I really learned along
with the students about this but like

7966
02:28:04,429 --> 02:28:04,439
with the students about this but like
 

7967
02:28:04,439 --> 02:28:06,710
with the students about this but like
this insistence on the features like we

7968
02:28:06,710 --> 02:28:06,720
this insistence on the features like we
 

7969
02:28:06,720 --> 02:28:09,290
this insistence on the features like we
can't have so many coupled integrated

7970
02:28:09,290 --> 02:28:09,300
can't have so many coupled integrated
 

7971
02:28:09,300 --> 02:28:11,330
can't have so many coupled integrated
hard technology developments like we

7972
02:28:11,330 --> 02:28:11,340
hard technology developments like we
 

7973
02:28:11,340 --> 02:28:13,429
hard technology developments like we
have to separate these somehow so we

7974
02:28:13,429 --> 02:28:13,439
have to separate these somehow so we
 

7975
02:28:13,439 --> 02:28:14,929
have to separate these somehow so we
worked and worked and worked at this and

7976
02:28:14,929 --> 02:28:14,939
worked and worked and worked at this and
 

7977
02:28:14,939 --> 02:28:17,330
worked and worked and worked at this and
in fact that that's what really in in my

7978
02:28:17,330 --> 02:28:17,340
in fact that that's what really in in my
 

7979
02:28:17,340 --> 02:28:19,490
in fact that that's what really in in my
opinion the greatest advantage of the

7980
02:28:19,490 --> 02:28:19,500
opinion the greatest advantage of the
 

7981
02:28:19,500 --> 02:28:21,530
opinion the greatest advantage of the
arc design and when it com you know and

7982
02:28:21,530 --> 02:28:21,540
arc design and when it com you know and
 

7983
02:28:21,540 --> 02:28:23,270
arc design and when it com you know and
and built into the Commonwealth Fusion

7984
02:28:23,270 --> 02:28:23,280
and built into the Commonwealth Fusion
 

7985
02:28:23,280 --> 02:28:25,969
and built into the Commonwealth Fusion
system idea is like to parse out the

7986
02:28:25,969 --> 02:28:25,979
system idea is like to parse out the
 

7987
02:28:25,979 --> 02:28:28,130
system idea is like to parse out the
problems like how can we attack these in

7988
02:28:28,130 --> 02:28:28,140
problems like how can we attack these in
 

7989
02:28:28,140 --> 02:28:29,330
problems like how can we attack these in
parallel

7990
02:28:29,330 --> 02:28:29,340
parallel
 

7991
02:28:29,340 --> 02:28:32,330
parallel
um yeah and so it really comes to we

7992
02:28:32,330 --> 02:28:32,340
um yeah and so it really comes to we
 

7993
02:28:32,340 --> 02:28:34,010
um yeah and so it really comes to we
talked about philosophy it's like a

7994
02:28:34,010 --> 02:28:34,020
talked about philosophy it's like a
 

7995
02:28:34,020 --> 02:28:35,929
talked about philosophy it's like a
design philosophy like how do you attack

7996
02:28:35,929 --> 02:28:35,939
design philosophy like how do you attack
 

7997
02:28:35,939 --> 02:28:38,270
design philosophy like how do you attack
these these kinds of problems and you

7998
02:28:38,270 --> 02:28:38,280
these these kinds of problems and you
 

7999
02:28:38,280 --> 02:28:40,309
these these kinds of problems and you
know you do it like that and also like

8000
02:28:40,309 --> 02:28:40,319
know you do it like that and also like
 

8001
02:28:40,319 --> 02:28:41,750
know you do it like that and also like
you mentioned Offline that there's a

8002
02:28:41,750 --> 02:28:41,760
you mentioned Offline that there's a
 

8003
02:28:41,760 --> 02:28:43,370
you mentioned Offline that there's a
power to

8004
02:28:43,370 --> 02:28:43,380
power to
 

8005
02:28:43,380 --> 02:28:45,650
power to
you know as part of a class

8006
02:28:45,650 --> 02:28:45,660
you know as part of a class
 

8007
02:28:45,660 --> 02:28:52,450
you know as part of a class
yeah to decide a nuclear fusion uh

8008
02:28:52,450 --> 02:28:52,460

 

8009
02:28:52,460 --> 02:28:55,550

and it's it's hard to imagine a more

8010
02:28:55,550 --> 02:28:55,560
and it's it's hard to imagine a more
 

8011
02:28:55,560 --> 02:28:58,190
and it's it's hard to imagine a more
powerful force than like 15 MIT PhD

8012
02:28:58,190 --> 02:28:58,200
powerful force than like 15 MIT PhD
 

8013
02:28:58,200 --> 02:29:00,590
powerful force than like 15 MIT PhD
students like working together towards

8014
02:29:00,590 --> 02:29:00,600
students like working together towards
 

8015
02:29:00,600 --> 02:29:03,830
students like working together towards
solving a problem and what I always in

8016
02:29:03,830 --> 02:29:03,840
solving a problem and what I always in
 

8017
02:29:03,840 --> 02:29:06,290
solving a problem and what I always in
fact we just we recently just taught the

8018
02:29:06,290 --> 02:29:06,300
fact we just we recently just taught the
 

8019
02:29:06,300 --> 02:29:08,630
fact we just we recently just taught the
the most recent you know I say I teach

8020
02:29:08,630 --> 02:29:08,640
the most recent you know I say I teach
 

8021
02:29:08,640 --> 02:29:11,330
the most recent you know I say I teach
it I mean I I guide it actually the most

8022
02:29:11,330 --> 02:29:11,340
it I mean I I guide it actually the most
 

8023
02:29:11,340 --> 02:29:12,710
it I mean I I guide it actually the most
recent version of this where they

8024
02:29:12,710 --> 02:29:12,720
recent version of this where they
 

8025
02:29:12,720 --> 02:29:14,570
recent version of this where they
actually designed you know based on this

8026
02:29:14,570 --> 02:29:14,580
actually designed you know based on this
 

8027
02:29:14,580 --> 02:29:16,370
actually designed you know based on this
National academies report they actually

8028
02:29:16,370 --> 02:29:16,380
National academies report they actually
 

8029
02:29:16,380 --> 02:29:19,309
National academies report they actually
designed like the pilot plant that has

8030
02:29:19,309 --> 02:29:19,319
designed like the pilot plant that has
 

8031
02:29:19,319 --> 02:29:21,349
designed like the pilot plant that has
bases and similarities to what we had

8032
02:29:21,349 --> 02:29:21,359
bases and similarities to what we had
 

8033
02:29:21,359 --> 02:29:23,389
bases and similarities to what we had
done before but you know I kept wanting

8034
02:29:23,389 --> 02:29:23,399
done before but you know I kept wanting
 

8035
02:29:23,399 --> 02:29:24,889
done before but you know I kept wanting
to like push the envelope and where they

8036
02:29:24,889 --> 02:29:24,899
to like push the envelope and where they
 

8037
02:29:24,899 --> 02:29:28,309
to like push the envelope and where they
are it's like the creativity and the uh

8038
02:29:28,309 --> 02:29:28,319
are it's like the creativity and the uh
 

8039
02:29:28,319 --> 02:29:31,309
are it's like the creativity and the uh
and the the energy that they bring to

8040
02:29:31,309 --> 02:29:31,319
and the the energy that they bring to
 

8041
02:29:31,319 --> 02:29:33,290
and the the energy that they bring to
these things is kind of like it keeps me

8042
02:29:33,290 --> 02:29:33,300
these things is kind of like it keeps me
 

8043
02:29:33,300 --> 02:29:34,910
these things is kind of like it keeps me
going like us you know I'm not gonna

8044
02:29:34,910 --> 02:29:34,920
going like us you know I'm not gonna
 

8045
02:29:34,920 --> 02:29:36,889
going like us you know I'm not gonna
retire anytime soon when I keep seeing

8046
02:29:36,889 --> 02:29:36,899
retire anytime soon when I keep seeing
 

8047
02:29:36,899 --> 02:29:38,389
retire anytime soon when I keep seeing
that kind of dedication and it's

8048
02:29:38,389 --> 02:29:38,399
that kind of dedication and it's
 

8049
02:29:38,399 --> 02:29:41,090
that kind of dedication and it's
wonderful around on that um it almost

02:30:52,610 --> 02:30:52,620
wasn't really a disaster because nothing
 

8113
02:30:52,620 --> 02:30:55,210
wasn't really a disaster because nothing
escaped from the thing but Chernobyl and

8114
02:30:55,210 --> 02:30:55,220
escaped from the thing but Chernobyl and
 

8115
02:30:55,220 --> 02:30:57,290
escaped from the thing but Chernobyl and
Fukushima were have been you know had

8116
02:30:57,290 --> 02:30:57,300
Fukushima were have been you know had
 

8117
02:30:57,300 --> 02:30:59,330
Fukushima were have been you know had
obvious consequences in the populations

8118
02:30:59,330 --> 02:30:59,340
obvious consequences in the populations
 

8119
02:30:59,340 --> 02:31:02,630
obvious consequences in the populations
and that live nearby what lesson do you

8120
02:31:02,630 --> 02:31:02,640
and that live nearby what lesson do you
 

8121
02:31:02,640 --> 02:31:04,610
and that live nearby what lesson do you
draw from those that you can carry

8122
02:31:04,610 --> 02:31:04,620
draw from those that you can carry
 

8123
02:31:04,620 --> 02:31:07,250
draw from those that you can carry
forward to Fusion now I know there's you

8124
02:31:07,250 --> 02:31:07,260
forward to Fusion now I know there's you
 

8125
02:31:07,260 --> 02:31:08,450
forward to Fusion now I know there's you
can say that you're not going to have

8126
02:31:08,450 --> 02:31:08,460
can say that you're not going to have
 

8127
02:31:08,460 --> 02:31:09,830
can say that you're not going to have
the same kind of issues but it's

8128
02:31:09,830 --> 02:31:09,840
the same kind of issues but it's
 

8129
02:31:09,840 --> 02:31:12,710
the same kind of issues but it's
possible that the same folks also said

8130
02:31:12,710 --> 02:31:12,720
possible that the same folks also said
 

8131
02:31:12,720 --> 02:31:14,270
possible that the same folks also said
they're not going to be have those same

8132
02:31:14,270 --> 02:31:14,280
they're not going to be have those same
 

8133
02:31:14,280 --> 02:31:16,309
they're not going to be have those same
kind of issues yeah we humans the human

8134
02:31:16,309 --> 02:31:16,319
kind of issues yeah we humans the human
 

8135
02:31:16,319 --> 02:31:18,710
kind of issues yeah we humans the human
factor we haven't talked about that one

8136
02:31:18,710 --> 02:31:18,720
factor we haven't talked about that one
 

8137
02:31:18,720 --> 02:31:20,990
factor we haven't talked about that one
quite as much but it's still there so to

8138
02:31:20,990 --> 02:31:21,000
quite as much but it's still there so to
 

8139
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:23,450
quite as much but it's still there so to
be clear it's so Fusion has the

8140
02:31:23,450 --> 02:31:23,460
be clear it's so Fusion has the
 

8141
02:31:23,460 --> 02:31:26,150
be clear it's so Fusion has the
intrinsic safety with respect to it

8142
02:31:26,150 --> 02:31:26,160
intrinsic safety with respect to it
 

8143
02:31:26,160 --> 02:31:29,330
intrinsic safety with respect to it
can't run away those are physics bases

8144
02:31:29,330 --> 02:31:29,340
can't run away those are physics bases
 

8145
02:31:29,340 --> 02:31:31,490
can't run away those are physics bases
Technology and Engineering basis of

8146
02:31:31,490 --> 02:31:31,500
Technology and Engineering basis of
 

8147
02:31:31,500 --> 02:31:33,410
Technology and Engineering basis of
running a complex again anything that

8148
02:31:33,410 --> 02:31:33,420
running a complex again anything that
 

8149
02:31:33,420 --> 02:31:35,389
running a complex again anything that
makes large amounts of power and heats

8150
02:31:35,389 --> 02:31:35,399
makes large amounts of power and heats
 

8151
02:31:35,399 --> 02:31:37,370
makes large amounts of power and heats
things up is got intrinsic safety in it

8152
02:31:37,370 --> 02:31:37,380
things up is got intrinsic safety in it
 

8153
02:31:37,380 --> 02:31:40,130
things up is got intrinsic safety in it
and by the fact that we actually produce

8154
02:31:40,130 --> 02:31:40,140
and by the fact that we actually produce
 

8155
02:31:40,140 --> 02:31:42,170
and by the fact that we actually produce
very energetic particles this doesn't

8156
02:31:42,170 --> 02:31:42,180
very energetic particles this doesn't
 

8157
02:31:42,180 --> 02:31:44,570
very energetic particles this doesn't
mean that there's no radiation involved

8158
02:31:44,570 --> 02:31:44,580
mean that there's no radiation involved
 

8159
02:31:44,580 --> 02:31:46,730
mean that there's no radiation involved
in ionizing radiation to be more

8160
02:31:46,730 --> 02:31:46,740
in ionizing radiation to be more
 

8161
02:31:46,740 --> 02:31:49,790
in ionizing radiation to be more
accurate infusion it's just that it's in

8162
02:31:49,790 --> 02:31:49,800
accurate infusion it's just that it's in
 

8163
02:31:49,800 --> 02:31:52,130
accurate infusion it's just that it's in
a very different order of magnitude

8164
02:31:52,130 --> 02:31:52,140
a very different order of magnitude
 

8165
02:31:52,140 --> 02:31:56,210
a very different order of magnitude
basically so what are the lessons uh in

8166
02:31:56,210 --> 02:31:56,220
basically so what are the lessons uh in
 

8167
02:31:56,220 --> 02:31:59,650
basically so what are the lessons uh in
in Fusion so so one of them is

8168
02:31:59,650 --> 02:31:59,660
in Fusion so so one of them is
 

8169
02:31:59,660 --> 02:32:02,990
in Fusion so so one of them is
make sure that you're looking at aspects

8170
02:32:02,990 --> 02:32:03,000
make sure that you're looking at aspects
 

8171
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:06,410
make sure that you're looking at aspects
of the holistic environmental and

8172
02:32:06,410 --> 02:32:06,420
of the holistic environmental and
 

8173
02:32:06,420 --> 02:32:08,690
of the holistic environmental and
societal footprint that the technology

8174
02:32:08,690 --> 02:32:08,700
societal footprint that the technology
 

8175
02:32:08,700 --> 02:32:11,570
societal footprint that the technology
will have as technologists we tend not

8176
02:32:11,570 --> 02:32:11,580
will have as technologists we tend not
 

8177
02:32:11,580 --> 02:32:14,150
will have as technologists we tend not
to focus on these and particularly in

8178
02:32:14,150 --> 02:32:14,160
to focus on these and particularly in
 

8179
02:32:14,160 --> 02:32:16,370
to focus on these and particularly in
early stages of development like we just

8180
02:32:16,370 --> 02:32:16,380
early stages of development like we just
 

8181
02:32:16,380 --> 02:32:19,070
early stages of development like we just
want something that works right but if

8182
02:32:19,070 --> 02:32:19,080
want something that works right but if
 

8183
02:32:19,080 --> 02:32:20,750
want something that works right but if
we if we come with just something that

8184
02:32:20,750 --> 02:32:20,760
we if we come with just something that
 

8185
02:32:20,760 --> 02:32:23,510
we if we come with just something that
works but doesn't actually satisfy the

8186
02:32:23,510 --> 02:32:23,520
works but doesn't actually satisfy the
 

8187
02:32:23,520 --> 02:32:26,090
works but doesn't actually satisfy the
societal demands for safety and for

8188
02:32:26,090 --> 02:32:26,100
societal demands for safety and for
 

8189
02:32:26,100 --> 02:32:28,070
societal demands for safety and for
dispose I mean we will have materials

8190
02:32:28,070 --> 02:32:28,080
dispose I mean we will have materials
 

8191
02:32:28,080 --> 02:32:29,929
dispose I mean we will have materials
that we have to dispose of out of fusion

8192
02:32:29,929 --> 02:32:29,939
that we have to dispose of out of fusion
 

8193
02:32:29,939 --> 02:32:32,630
that we have to dispose of out of fusion
just this is but there's technological

8194
02:32:32,630 --> 02:32:32,640
just this is but there's technological
 

8195
02:32:32,640 --> 02:32:35,150
just this is but there's technological
questions about what that looks like so

8196
02:32:35,150 --> 02:32:35,160
questions about what that looks like so
 

8197
02:32:35,160 --> 02:32:36,889
questions about what that looks like so
will this look like something that you

8198
02:32:36,889 --> 02:32:36,899
will this look like something that you
 

8199
02:32:36,899 --> 02:32:38,690
will this look like something that you
have to you know put in the ground for

8200
02:32:38,690 --> 02:32:38,700
have to you know put in the ground for
 

8201
02:32:38,700 --> 02:32:41,750
have to you know put in the ground for
100 years or five years like and the

8202
02:32:41,750 --> 02:32:41,760
100 years or five years like and the
 

8203
02:32:41,760 --> 02:32:44,150
100 years or five years like and the
consequences of those are both economic

8204
02:32:44,150 --> 02:32:44,160
consequences of those are both economic
 

8205
02:32:44,160 --> 02:32:46,670
consequences of those are both economic
and societal acceptance and so forth but

8206
02:32:46,670 --> 02:32:46,680
and societal acceptance and so forth but
 

8207
02:32:46,680 --> 02:32:48,710
and societal acceptance and so forth but
don't bury those like put the bring

8208
02:32:48,710 --> 02:32:48,720
don't bury those like put the bring
 

8209
02:32:48,720 --> 02:32:50,870
don't bury those like put the bring
these up front talk to people about them

8210
02:32:50,870 --> 02:32:50,880
these up front talk to people about them
 

8211
02:32:50,880 --> 02:32:52,790
these up front talk to people about them
and make people realize that you're

8212
02:32:52,790 --> 02:32:52,800
and make people realize that you're
 

8213
02:32:52,800 --> 02:32:54,469
and make people realize that you're
actually you know the way I would look

8214
02:32:54,469 --> 02:32:54,479
actually you know the way I would look
 

8215
02:32:54,479 --> 02:32:56,150
actually you know the way I would look
is that you're making Fusion more

8216
02:32:56,150 --> 02:32:56,160
is that you're making Fusion more
 

8217
02:32:56,160 --> 02:32:58,070
is that you're making Fusion more
economically attractive by making it

8218
02:32:58,070 --> 02:32:58,080
economically attractive by making it
 

8219
02:32:58,080 --> 02:33:01,150
economically attractive by making it
more societally except as well too

8220
02:33:01,150 --> 02:33:01,160
more societally except as well too
 

8221
02:33:01,160 --> 02:33:03,889
more societally except as well too
and then realize is that you know I

8222
02:33:03,889 --> 02:33:03,899
and then realize is that you know I
 

8223
02:33:03,899 --> 02:33:05,630
and then realize is that you know I
think there's a few interesting you know

8224
02:33:05,630 --> 02:33:05,640
think there's a few interesting you know
 

8225
02:33:05,640 --> 02:33:07,730
think there's a few interesting you know
boundaries basically this so one of them

8226
02:33:07,730 --> 02:33:07,740
boundaries basically this so one of them
 

8227
02:33:07,740 --> 02:33:10,309
boundaries basically this so one of them
speaking of boundaries that successful

8228
02:33:10,309 --> 02:33:10,319
speaking of boundaries that successful
 

8229
02:33:10,319 --> 02:33:13,190
speaking of boundaries that successful
Fusion devices I'm pretty sure will

8230
02:33:13,190 --> 02:33:13,200
Fusion devices I'm pretty sure will
 

8231
02:33:13,200 --> 02:33:15,710
Fusion devices I'm pretty sure will
require that you don't have to re have

8232
02:33:15,710 --> 02:33:15,720
require that you don't have to re have
 

8233
02:33:15,720 --> 02:33:17,929
require that you don't have to re have
an evacuation plan for anybody who lives

8234
02:33:17,929 --> 02:33:17,939
an evacuation plan for anybody who lives
 

8235
02:33:17,939 --> 02:33:20,090
an evacuation plan for anybody who lives
at the site boundary

8236
02:33:20,090 --> 02:33:20,100
at the site boundary
 

8237
02:33:20,100 --> 02:33:22,670
at the site boundary
so this has this has implications for

8238
02:33:22,670 --> 02:33:22,680
so this has this has implications for
 

8239
02:33:22,680 --> 02:33:25,130
so this has this has implications for
what we build from a fusion engineering

8240
02:33:25,130 --> 02:33:25,140
what we build from a fusion engineering
 

8241
02:33:25,140 --> 02:33:27,469
what we build from a fusion engineering
point of view but has major implications

8242
02:33:27,469 --> 02:33:27,479
point of view but has major implications
 

8243
02:33:27,479 --> 02:33:29,870
point of view but has major implications
for where you can cite Fusion devices

8244
02:33:29,870 --> 02:33:29,880
for where you can cite Fusion devices
 

8245
02:33:29,880 --> 02:33:32,270
for where you can cite Fusion devices
right so in many ways it becomes more

8246
02:33:32,270 --> 02:33:32,280
right so in many ways it becomes more
 

8247
02:33:32,280 --> 02:33:34,010
right so in many ways it becomes more
like well you know we have fences around

8248
02:33:34,010 --> 02:33:34,020
like well you know we have fences around
 

8249
02:33:34,020 --> 02:33:36,050
like well you know we have fences around
you know industrial heat sources and

8250
02:33:36,050 --> 02:33:36,060
you know industrial heat sources and
 

8251
02:33:36,060 --> 02:33:37,309
you know industrial heat sources and
things like this for a reason right for

8252
02:33:37,309 --> 02:33:37,319
things like this for a reason right for
 

8253
02:33:37,319 --> 02:33:39,590
things like this for a reason right for
personal safety it looks more like that

8254
02:33:39,590 --> 02:33:39,600
personal safety it looks more like that
 

8255
02:33:39,600 --> 02:33:41,450
personal safety it looks more like that
right it's not quite as simple as that

8256
02:33:41,450 --> 02:33:41,460
right it's not quite as simple as that
 

8257
02:33:41,460 --> 02:33:43,370
right it's not quite as simple as that
but that's what it should look like and

8258
02:33:43,370 --> 02:33:43,380
but that's what it should look like and
 

8259
02:33:43,380 --> 02:33:45,170
but that's what it should look like and
in fact we have research projects going

8260
02:33:45,170 --> 02:33:45,180
in fact we have research projects going
 

8261
02:33:45,180 --> 02:33:47,450
in fact we have research projects going
on right now at MIT that are like trying

8262
02:33:47,450 --> 02:33:47,460
on right now at MIT that are like trying
 

8263
02:33:47,460 --> 02:33:49,490
on right now at MIT that are like trying
to push the Technologies to make it more

8264
02:33:49,490 --> 02:33:49,500
to push the Technologies to make it more
 

8265
02:33:49,500 --> 02:33:51,830
to push the Technologies to make it more
look like that I think that those are

8266
02:33:51,830 --> 02:33:51,840
look like that I think that those are
 

8267
02:33:51,840 --> 02:33:52,849
look like that I think that those are
key

8268
02:33:52,849 --> 02:33:52,859
key
 

8269
02:33:52,859 --> 02:33:55,429
key
and then in the end as I said like so

8270
02:33:55,429 --> 02:33:55,439
and then in the end as I said like so
 

8271
02:33:55,439 --> 02:33:57,110
and then in the end as I said like so
Chernobyl is physically impossible

8272
02:33:57,110 --> 02:33:57,120
Chernobyl is physically impossible
 

8273
02:33:57,120 --> 02:34:00,110
Chernobyl is physically impossible
actually in an effusion system I'm a

8274
02:34:00,110 --> 02:34:00,120
actually in an effusion system I'm a
 

8275
02:34:00,120 --> 02:34:02,030
actually in an effusion system I'm a
physics from a physics perspective you

8276
02:34:02,030 --> 02:34:02,040
physics from a physics perspective you
 

8277
02:34:02,040 --> 02:34:04,010
physics from a physics perspective you
can't run away like it did at Chernobyl

8278
02:34:04,010 --> 02:34:04,020
can't run away like it did at Chernobyl
 

8279
02:34:04,020 --> 02:34:05,990
can't run away like it did at Chernobyl
which was basically human error that you

8280
02:34:05,990 --> 02:34:06,000
which was basically human error that you
 

8281
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:07,730
which was basically human error that you
know of letting letting the reactors

8282
02:34:07,730 --> 02:34:07,740
know of letting letting the reactors
 

8283
02:34:07,740 --> 02:34:10,190
know of letting letting the reactors
like run out of control essentially the

8284
02:34:10,190 --> 02:34:10,200
like run out of control essentially the
 

8285
02:34:10,200 --> 02:34:11,870
like run out of control essentially the
human error can still happen nuclear

8286
02:34:11,870 --> 02:34:11,880
human error can still happen nuclear
 

8287
02:34:11,880 --> 02:34:14,090
human error can still happen nuclear
with Fusion basically yeah so but in

8288
02:34:14,090 --> 02:34:14,100
with Fusion basically yeah so but in
 

8289
02:34:14,100 --> 02:34:15,950
with Fusion basically yeah so but in
that one if human error occurs then it

8290
02:34:15,950 --> 02:34:15,960
that one if human error occurs then it
 

8291
02:34:15,960 --> 02:34:18,889
that one if human error occurs then it
just stops and this is done and all of

8292
02:34:18,889 --> 02:34:18,899
just stops and this is done and all of
 

8293
02:34:18,899 --> 02:34:20,750
just stops and this is done and all of
those things this is the requirement of

8294
02:34:20,750 --> 02:34:20,760
those things this is the requirement of
 

8295
02:34:20,760 --> 02:34:22,610
those things this is the requirement of
of us as technologists and and

8296
02:34:22,610 --> 02:34:22,620
of us as technologists and and
 

8297
02:34:22,620 --> 02:34:25,490
of us as technologists and and
developers of this technology to not

8298
02:34:25,490 --> 02:34:25,500
developers of this technology to not
 

8299
02:34:25,500 --> 02:34:28,130
developers of this technology to not
ignore that dimension in fact of the

8300
02:34:28,130 --> 02:34:28,140
ignore that dimension in fact of the
 

8301
02:34:28,140 --> 02:34:30,469
ignore that dimension in fact of the
design and that's why me personally I'm

8302
02:34:30,469 --> 02:34:30,479
design and that's why me personally I'm
 

8303
02:34:30,479 --> 02:34:31,270
design and that's why me personally I'm
actually

8304
02:34:31,270 --> 02:34:31,280
actually
 

8305
02:34:31,280 --> 02:34:33,889
actually
pouring myself more and more into that

8306
02:34:33,889 --> 02:34:33,899
pouring myself more and more into that
 

8307
02:34:33,899 --> 02:34:35,990
pouring myself more and more into that
area because this is going to be I

8308
02:34:35,990 --> 02:34:36,000
area because this is going to be I
 

8309
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:37,969
area because this is going to be I
actually really think it is an aspect of

8310
02:34:37,969 --> 02:34:37,979
actually really think it is an aspect of
 

8311
02:34:37,979 --> 02:34:40,070
actually really think it is an aspect of
the economic viability of fusion because

8312
02:34:40,070 --> 02:34:40,080
the economic viability of fusion because
 

8313
02:34:40,080 --> 02:34:42,889
the economic viability of fusion because
it clearly differentiates ourselves and

8314
02:34:42,889 --> 02:34:42,899
it clearly differentiates ourselves and
 

8315
02:34:42,899 --> 02:34:44,630
it clearly differentiates ourselves and
also sets this up to be about what we

8316
02:34:44,630 --> 02:34:44,640
also sets this up to be about what we
 

8317
02:34:44,640 --> 02:34:46,670
also sets this up to be about what we
want Fusion to be is that again on paper

8318
02:34:46,670 --> 02:34:46,680
want Fusion to be is that again on paper
 

8319
02:34:46,680 --> 02:34:49,910
want Fusion to be is that again on paper
Fusion can supply all of our energy like

8320
02:34:49,910 --> 02:34:49,920
Fusion can supply all of our energy like
 

8321
02:34:49,920 --> 02:34:52,429
Fusion can supply all of our energy like
all of it so this means I want it to be

8322
02:34:52,429 --> 02:34:52,439
all of it so this means I want it to be
 

8323
02:34:52,439 --> 02:34:55,010
all of it so this means I want it to be
like like really environmentally benign

8324
02:34:55,010 --> 02:34:55,020
like like really environmentally benign
 

8325
02:34:55,020 --> 02:34:57,230
like like really environmentally benign
but this takes engineering Ingenuity

8326
02:34:57,230 --> 02:34:57,240
but this takes engineering Ingenuity
 

8327
02:34:57,240 --> 02:35:00,050
but this takes engineering Ingenuity
basically to do that let me ask you some

8328
02:35:00,050 --> 02:35:00,060
basically to do that let me ask you some
 

8329
02:35:00,060 --> 02:35:02,870
basically to do that let me ask you some
wild out there questions sure so first

8330
02:35:02,870 --> 02:35:02,880
wild out there questions sure so first
 

8331
02:35:02,880 --> 02:35:04,400
wild out there questions sure so first
we've been talking too much you know

8332
02:35:04,400 --> 02:35:04,410
we've been talking too much you know
 

8333
02:35:04,410 --> 02:35:07,389
we've been talking too much you know
[Laughter]

8334
02:35:07,389 --> 02:35:07,399
[Laughter]
 

8335
02:35:07,399 --> 02:35:10,730
[Laughter]
simple uh practical things in everyday

8336
02:35:10,730 --> 02:35:10,740
simple uh practical things in everyday
 

8337
02:35:10,740 --> 02:35:13,070
simple uh practical things in everyday
life no the only revolutionizing the

8338
02:35:13,070 --> 02:35:13,080
life no the only revolutionizing the
 

8339
02:35:13,080 --> 02:35:14,690
life no the only revolutionizing the
entire energy infrastructure of human

8340
02:35:14,690 --> 02:35:14,700
entire energy infrastructure of human
 

8341
02:35:14,700 --> 02:35:17,150
entire energy infrastructure of human
civilization yes but

8342
02:35:17,150 --> 02:35:17,160
civilization yes but
 

8343
02:35:17,160 --> 02:35:20,330
civilization yes but
um so cold fusion yeah this this idea

8344
02:35:20,330 --> 02:35:20,340
um so cold fusion yeah this this idea
 

8345
02:35:20,340 --> 02:35:24,050
um so cold fusion yeah this this idea
this dream uh this interesting physical

8346
02:35:24,050 --> 02:35:24,060
this dream uh this interesting physical
 

8347
02:35:24,060 --> 02:35:27,650
this dream uh this interesting physical
goals seemed to be impossible uh but

8348
02:35:27,650 --> 02:35:27,660
goals seemed to be impossible uh but
 

8349
02:35:27,660 --> 02:35:29,150
goals seemed to be impossible uh but
perhaps it's possible do you think it is

8350
02:35:29,150 --> 02:35:29,160
perhaps it's possible do you think it is
 

8351
02:35:29,160 --> 02:35:31,070
perhaps it's possible do you think it is
possible do you think down the line

8352
02:35:31,070 --> 02:35:31,080
possible do you think down the line
 

8353
02:35:31,080 --> 02:35:32,570
possible do you think down the line
somewhere in

8354
02:35:32,570 --> 02:35:32,580
somewhere in
 

8355
02:35:32,580 --> 02:35:33,230
somewhere in
um

8356
02:35:33,230 --> 02:35:33,240
um
 

8357
02:35:33,240 --> 02:35:35,150
um
in the far distance as possible to

8358
02:35:35,150 --> 02:35:35,160
in the far distance as possible to
 

8359
02:35:35,160 --> 02:35:38,990
in the far distance as possible to
achieve Fusion at a low temperature

8360
02:35:38,990 --> 02:35:39,000
achieve Fusion at a low temperature
 

8361
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:42,830
achieve Fusion at a low temperature
it's very very very unlikely and this

8362
02:35:42,830 --> 02:35:42,840
it's very very very unlikely and this
 

8363
02:35:42,840 --> 02:35:47,030
it's very very very unlikely and this
comes from so this would require a

8364
02:35:47,030 --> 02:35:47,040
comes from so this would require a
 

8365
02:35:47,040 --> 02:35:49,010
comes from so this would require a
pretty fundamental shift in our

8366
02:35:49,010 --> 02:35:49,020
pretty fundamental shift in our
 

8367
02:35:49,020 --> 02:35:52,130
pretty fundamental shift in our
understanding of of physics like as we

8368
02:35:52,130 --> 02:35:52,140
understanding of of physics like as we
 

8369
02:35:52,140 --> 02:35:54,950
understanding of of physics like as we
know it now and we know a heck of a lot

8370
02:35:54,950 --> 02:35:54,960
know it now and we know a heck of a lot
 

8371
02:35:54,960 --> 02:35:58,309
know it now and we know a heck of a lot
about how nuclear reactions occur

8372
02:35:58,309 --> 02:35:58,319
about how nuclear reactions occur
 

8373
02:35:58,319 --> 02:35:59,990
about how nuclear reactions occur
um but by the way what's interesting is

8374
02:35:59,990 --> 02:36:00,000
um but by the way what's interesting is
 

8375
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:01,370
um but by the way what's interesting is
that there's they actually have a

8376
02:36:01,370 --> 02:36:01,380
that there's they actually have a
 

8377
02:36:01,380 --> 02:36:02,690
that there's they actually have a
different name for it they call it

8378
02:36:02,690 --> 02:36:02,700
different name for it they call it
 

8379
02:36:02,700 --> 02:36:05,030
different name for it they call it
leaner like low energy nuclear reactions

8380
02:36:05,030 --> 02:36:05,040
leaner like low energy nuclear reactions
 

8381
02:36:05,040 --> 02:36:07,010
leaner like low energy nuclear reactions
but we do have low energy nuclear

8382
02:36:07,010 --> 02:36:07,020
but we do have low energy nuclear
 

8383
02:36:07,020 --> 02:36:08,330
but we do have low energy nuclear
reactions we know these it's because

8384
02:36:08,330 --> 02:36:08,340
reactions we know these it's because
 

8385
02:36:08,340 --> 02:36:11,290
reactions we know these it's because
these come from particularly the weak

8386
02:36:11,290 --> 02:36:11,300
these come from particularly the weak
 

8387
02:36:11,300 --> 02:36:15,050
these come from particularly the weak
interaction the weak Force nuclear force

8388
02:36:15,050 --> 02:36:15,060
interaction the weak Force nuclear force
 

8389
02:36:15,060 --> 02:36:18,650
interaction the weak Force nuclear force
and so it's at this point

8390
02:36:18,650 --> 02:36:18,660
and so it's at this point
 

8391
02:36:18,660 --> 02:36:19,250
and so it's at this point
um

8392
02:36:19,250 --> 02:36:19,260
um
 

8393
02:36:19,260 --> 02:36:21,230
um
you know as a scientist you always keep

8394
02:36:21,230 --> 02:36:21,240
you know as a scientist you always keep
 

8395
02:36:21,240 --> 02:36:23,090
you know as a scientist you always keep
yourself open because but you also

8396
02:36:23,090 --> 02:36:23,100
yourself open because but you also
 

8397
02:36:23,100 --> 02:36:24,889
yourself open because but you also
demand proof right and that's the thing

8398
02:36:24,889 --> 02:36:24,899
demand proof right and that's the thing
 

8399
02:36:24,899 --> 02:36:26,929
demand proof right and that's the thing
it almost requires a breakdown on the

8400
02:36:26,929 --> 02:36:26,939
it almost requires a breakdown on the
 

8401
02:36:26,939 --> 02:36:28,730
it almost requires a breakdown on the
theoretical physics side so something

8402
02:36:28,730 --> 02:36:28,740
theoretical physics side so something
 

8403
02:36:28,740 --> 02:36:30,710
theoretical physics side so something
some deeper understanding about quantum

8404
02:36:30,710 --> 02:36:30,720
some deeper understanding about quantum
 

8405
02:36:30,720 --> 02:36:32,150
some deeper understanding about quantum
mechanics something so the quantum

8406
02:36:32,150 --> 02:36:32,160
mechanics something so the quantum
 

8407
02:36:32,160 --> 02:36:34,190
mechanics something so the quantum
tunneling some some weird yeah and that

8408
02:36:34,190 --> 02:36:34,200
tunneling some some weird yeah and that
 

8409
02:36:34,200 --> 02:36:36,170
tunneling some some weird yeah and that
and and people have looked at that but

8410
02:36:36,170 --> 02:36:36,180
and and people have looked at that but
 

8411
02:36:36,180 --> 02:36:37,849
and and people have looked at that but
even like something like Quantum

8412
02:36:37,849 --> 02:36:37,859
even like something like Quantum
 

8413
02:36:37,859 --> 02:36:39,770
even like something like Quantum
tunneling has a limit as to what it can

8414
02:36:39,770 --> 02:36:39,780
tunneling has a limit as to what it can
 

8415
02:36:39,780 --> 02:36:41,270
tunneling has a limit as to what it can
actually do so there there are people

8416
02:36:41,270 --> 02:36:41,280
actually do so there there are people
 

8417
02:36:41,280 --> 02:36:44,330
actually do so there there are people
who are genuine you know that really

8418
02:36:44,330 --> 02:36:44,340
who are genuine you know that really
 

8419
02:36:44,340 --> 02:36:46,370
who are genuine you know that really
want to see it make it but you know sort

8420
02:36:46,370 --> 02:36:46,380
want to see it make it but you know sort
 

8421
02:36:46,380 --> 02:36:49,010
want to see it make it but you know sort
of goes to the extraordinary I mean we

8422
02:36:49,010 --> 02:36:49,020
of goes to the extraordinary I mean we
 

8423
02:36:49,020 --> 02:36:51,349
of goes to the extraordinary I mean we
know Fusion happens at these high

8424
02:36:51,349 --> 02:36:51,359
know Fusion happens at these high
 

8425
02:36:51,359 --> 02:36:54,170
know Fusion happens at these high
energies like this when we know this

8426
02:36:54,170 --> 02:36:54,180
energies like this when we know this
 

8427
02:36:54,180 --> 02:36:55,730
energies like this when we know this
extremely accurately and I can show you

8428
02:36:55,730 --> 02:36:55,740
extremely accurately and I can show you
 

8429
02:36:55,740 --> 02:36:58,010
extremely accurately and I can show you
a plot that shows that as you go to

8430
02:36:58,010 --> 02:36:58,020
a plot that shows that as you go to
 

8431
02:36:58,020 --> 02:36:59,750
a plot that shows that as you go to
lower lower energy it basically becomes

8432
02:36:59,750 --> 02:36:59,760
lower lower energy it basically becomes
 

8433
02:36:59,760 --> 02:37:02,450
lower lower energy it basically becomes
immeasurable so if you're going down

8434
02:37:02,450 --> 02:37:02,460
immeasurable so if you're going down
 

8435
02:37:02,460 --> 02:37:04,190
immeasurable so if you're going down
this other pathway it means there's

8436
02:37:04,190 --> 02:37:04,200
this other pathway it means there's
 

8437
02:37:04,200 --> 02:37:06,230
this other pathway it means there's
really a very

8438
02:37:06,230 --> 02:37:06,240
really a very
 

8439
02:37:06,240 --> 02:37:10,090
really a very
different physical mechanism involved so

8440
02:37:10,090 --> 02:37:10,100
different physical mechanism involved so
 

8441
02:37:10,100 --> 02:37:13,250
different physical mechanism involved so
all I would say is that I I actually

8442
02:37:13,250 --> 02:37:13,260
all I would say is that I I actually
 

8443
02:37:13,260 --> 02:37:15,830
all I would say is that I I actually
poke in my head once in a while to see

8444
02:37:15,830 --> 02:37:15,840
poke in my head once in a while to see
 

8445
02:37:15,840 --> 02:37:18,469
poke in my head once in a while to see
what's going on and that area

8446
02:37:18,469 --> 02:37:18,479
what's going on and that area
 

8447
02:37:18,479 --> 02:37:20,090
what's going on and that area
um and as scientists we should always

8448
02:37:20,090 --> 02:37:20,100
um and as scientists we should always
 

8449
02:37:20,100 --> 02:37:22,670
um and as scientists we should always
try to make ourselves open

8450
02:37:22,670 --> 02:37:22,680
try to make ourselves open
 

8451
02:37:22,680 --> 02:37:25,429
try to make ourselves open
um and uh but in this one it's like but

8452
02:37:25,429 --> 02:37:25,439
um and uh but in this one it's like but
 

8453
02:37:25,439 --> 02:37:28,849
um and uh but in this one it's like but
show me something that I can measure and

8454
02:37:28,849 --> 02:37:28,859
show me something that I can measure and
 

8455
02:37:28,859 --> 02:37:30,770
show me something that I can measure and
that it's repeatable and then and then

8456
02:37:30,770 --> 02:37:30,780
that it's repeatable and then and then
 

8457
02:37:30,780 --> 02:37:32,090
that it's repeatable and then and then
it then it's going to take more

8458
02:37:32,090 --> 02:37:32,100
it then it's going to take more
 

8459
02:37:32,100 --> 02:37:34,370
it then it's going to take more
extraordinary effort and to date this

8460
02:37:34,370 --> 02:37:34,380
extraordinary effort and to date this
 

8461
02:37:34,380 --> 02:37:36,590
extraordinary effort and to date this
has not met that threshold in my opinion

8462
02:37:36,590 --> 02:37:36,600
has not met that threshold in my opinion
 

8463
02:37:36,600 --> 02:37:40,490
has not met that threshold in my opinion
so I'm even more so than just mentioning

8464
02:37:40,490 --> 02:37:40,500
so I'm even more so than just mentioning
 

8465
02:37:40,500 --> 02:37:42,830
so I'm even more so than just mentioning
or in that question thinking about

8466
02:37:42,830 --> 02:37:42,840
or in that question thinking about
 

8467
02:37:42,840 --> 02:37:44,330
or in that question thinking about
people that are claiming to have

8468
02:37:44,330 --> 02:37:44,340
people that are claiming to have
 

8469
02:37:44,340 --> 02:37:46,370
people that are claiming to have
achieved cold fusion I'm more thinking

8470
02:37:46,370 --> 02:37:46,380
achieved cold fusion I'm more thinking
 

8471
02:37:46,380 --> 02:37:47,750
achieved cold fusion I'm more thinking
even about

8472
02:37:47,750 --> 02:37:47,760
even about
 

8473
02:37:47,760 --> 02:37:50,210
even about
people who are studying black holes and

8474
02:37:50,210 --> 02:37:50,220
people who are studying black holes and
 

8475
02:37:50,220 --> 02:37:51,889
people who are studying black holes and
they're they're basically trying to

8476
02:37:51,889 --> 02:37:51,899
they're they're basically trying to
 

8477
02:37:51,899 --> 02:37:53,030
they're they're basically trying to
understand

8478
02:37:53,030 --> 02:37:53,040
understand
 

8479
02:37:53,040 --> 02:37:55,429
understand
the function of you know theoretical

8480
02:37:55,429 --> 02:37:55,439
the function of you know theoretical
 

8481
02:37:55,439 --> 02:37:58,550
the function of you know theoretical
physicists that are doing the Long Haul

8482
02:37:58,550 --> 02:37:58,560
physicists that are doing the Long Haul
 

8483
02:37:58,560 --> 02:38:01,130
physicists that are doing the Long Haul
yeah trying to investigate like okay

8484
02:38:01,130 --> 02:38:01,140
yeah trying to investigate like okay
 

8485
02:38:01,140 --> 02:38:02,630
yeah trying to investigate like okay
what is happening at the singularity

8486
02:38:02,630 --> 02:38:02,640
what is happening at the singularity
 

8487
02:38:02,640 --> 02:38:05,870
what is happening at the singularity
what is uh this kind of

8488
02:38:05,870 --> 02:38:05,880
what is uh this kind of
 

8489
02:38:05,880 --> 02:38:08,450
what is uh this kind of
uh holographic projections on a plate

8490
02:38:08,450 --> 02:38:08,460
uh holographic projections on a plate
 

8491
02:38:08,460 --> 02:38:10,670
uh holographic projections on a plate
these weird freaking things that are out

8492
02:38:10,670 --> 02:38:10,680
these weird freaking things that are out
 

8493
02:38:10,680 --> 02:38:12,290
these weird freaking things that are out
there in the universe and like somehow

8494
02:38:12,290 --> 02:38:12,300
there in the universe and like somehow
 

8495
02:38:12,300 --> 02:38:14,270
there in the universe and like somehow
accidentally they start to figure out

8496
02:38:14,270 --> 02:38:14,280
accidentally they start to figure out
 

8497
02:38:14,280 --> 02:38:17,389
accidentally they start to figure out
something weird yeah and then all of a

8498
02:38:17,389 --> 02:38:17,399
something weird yeah and then all of a
 

8499
02:38:17,399 --> 02:38:19,010
something weird yeah and then all of a
sudden there's weirdness all over the

8500
02:38:19,010 --> 02:38:19,020
sudden there's weirdness all over the
 

8501
02:38:19,020 --> 02:38:20,929
sudden there's weirdness all over the
place already yeah somehow that

8502
02:38:20,929 --> 02:38:20,939
place already yeah somehow that
 

8503
02:38:20,939 --> 02:38:22,910
place already yeah somehow that
weirdness will yeah I think in a time

8504
02:38:22,910 --> 02:38:22,920
weirdness will yeah I think in a time
 

8505
02:38:22,920 --> 02:38:24,650
weirdness will yeah I think in a time
scale probably of a hundred years or so

8506
02:38:24,650 --> 02:38:24,660
scale probably of a hundred years or so
 

8507
02:38:24,660 --> 02:38:26,650
scale probably of a hundred years or so
that weirdness will open

8508
02:38:26,650 --> 02:38:26,660
that weirdness will open
 

8509
02:38:26,660 --> 02:38:30,950
that weirdness will open
uh it just seems like nuclear fusion and

8510
02:38:30,950 --> 02:38:30,960
uh it just seems like nuclear fusion and
 

8511
02:38:30,960 --> 02:38:32,990
uh it just seems like nuclear fusion and
black holes and all of this are two

8512
02:38:32,990 --> 02:38:33,000
black holes and all of this are two
 

8513
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:34,910
black holes and all of this are two
they're next door neighbors a little bit

8514
02:38:34,910 --> 02:38:34,920
they're next door neighbors a little bit
 

8515
02:38:34,920 --> 02:38:36,830
they're next door neighbors a little bit
too much for like you'll find something

8516
02:38:36,830 --> 02:38:36,840
too much for like you'll find something
 

8517
02:38:36,840 --> 02:38:38,870
too much for like you'll find something
yeah interesting let me tell you a story

8518
02:38:38,870 --> 02:38:38,880
yeah interesting let me tell you a story
 

8519
02:38:38,880 --> 02:38:41,090
yeah interesting let me tell you a story
about this yes okay it's a real story

8520
02:38:41,090 --> 02:38:41,100
about this yes okay it's a real story
 

8521
02:38:41,100 --> 02:38:42,410
about this yes okay it's a real story
okay

8522
02:38:42,410 --> 02:38:42,420
okay
 

8523
02:38:42,420 --> 02:38:45,790
okay
so they're a really really clever

8524
02:38:45,790 --> 02:38:45,800
so they're a really really clever
 

8525
02:38:45,800 --> 02:38:48,650
so they're a really really clever
scientists in the in the end of the late

8526
02:38:48,650 --> 02:38:48,660
scientists in the in the end of the late
 

8527
02:38:48,660 --> 02:38:51,650
scientists in the in the end of the late
1800s in the world you talk about like

8528
02:38:51,650 --> 02:38:51,660
1800s in the world you talk about like
 

8529
02:38:51,660 --> 02:38:53,570
1800s in the world you talk about like
James cork Maxwell when you talk about

8530
02:38:53,570 --> 02:38:53,580
James cork Maxwell when you talk about
 

8531
02:38:53,580 --> 02:38:56,090
James cork Maxwell when you talk about
Lord Calvin and you talk about Lawrence

8532
02:38:56,090 --> 02:38:56,100
Lord Calvin and you talk about Lawrence
 

8533
02:38:56,100 --> 02:38:57,830
Lord Calvin and you talk about Lawrence
actually who named after these other

8534
02:38:57,830 --> 02:38:57,840
actually who named after these other
 

8535
02:38:57,840 --> 02:39:00,950
actually who named after these other
ones and you on and on and on and like

8536
02:39:00,950 --> 02:39:00,960
ones and you on and on and on and like
 

8537
02:39:00,960 --> 02:39:02,110
ones and you on and on and on and like
Faraday and they discovered

8538
02:39:02,110 --> 02:39:02,120
Faraday and they discovered
 

8539
02:39:02,120 --> 02:39:04,910
Faraday and they discovered
electromagnetism holy cow and it's like

8540
02:39:04,910 --> 02:39:04,920
electromagnetism holy cow and it's like
 

8541
02:39:04,920 --> 02:39:08,389
electromagnetism holy cow and it's like
they figure out all these things and yet

8542
02:39:08,389 --> 02:39:08,399
they figure out all these things and yet
 

8543
02:39:08,399 --> 02:39:11,150
they figure out all these things and yet
there were these weird

8544
02:39:11,150 --> 02:39:11,160
there were these weird
 

8545
02:39:11,160 --> 02:39:13,790
there were these weird
things going on that you couldn't quite

8546
02:39:13,790 --> 02:39:13,800
things going on that you couldn't quite
 

8547
02:39:13,800 --> 02:39:15,830
things going on that you couldn't quite
figure out it's like what the heck is

8548
02:39:15,830 --> 02:39:15,840
figure out it's like what the heck is
 

8549
02:39:15,840 --> 02:39:18,830
figure out it's like what the heck is
going on with us right but we teach this

8550
02:39:18,830 --> 02:39:18,840
going on with us right but we teach this
 

8551
02:39:18,840 --> 02:39:20,929
going on with us right but we teach this
all the time in in physics classes right

8552
02:39:20,929 --> 02:39:20,939
all the time in in physics classes right
 

8553
02:39:20,939 --> 02:39:23,630
all the time in in physics classes right
so what was going on well there's just a

8554
02:39:23,630 --> 02:39:23,640
so what was going on well there's just a
 

8555
02:39:23,640 --> 02:39:24,650
so what was going on well there's just a
few

8556
02:39:24,650 --> 02:39:24,660
few
 

8557
02:39:24,660 --> 02:39:27,290
few
there's just a few kind of things things

8558
02:39:27,290 --> 02:39:27,300
there's just a few kind of things things
 

8559
02:39:27,300 --> 02:39:29,210
there's just a few kind of things things
unchecked but basically we're at the end

8560
02:39:29,210 --> 02:39:29,220
unchecked but basically we're at the end
 

8561
02:39:29,220 --> 02:39:30,770
unchecked but basically we're at the end
of Discovery because we figured out how

8562
02:39:30,770 --> 02:39:30,780
of Discovery because we figured out how
 

8563
02:39:30,780 --> 02:39:32,870
of Discovery because we figured out how
everything works because we've got we've

8564
02:39:32,870 --> 02:39:32,880
everything works because we've got we've
 

8565
02:39:32,880 --> 02:39:34,969
everything works because we've got we've
got basically Newtonian mechanics and

8566
02:39:34,969 --> 02:39:34,979
got basically Newtonian mechanics and
 

8567
02:39:34,979 --> 02:39:36,710
got basically Newtonian mechanics and
we've got Maxwell's equations which

8568
02:39:36,710 --> 02:39:36,720
we've got Maxwell's equations which
 

8569
02:39:36,720 --> 02:39:38,750
we've got Maxwell's equations which
describe basically how matter gets

8570
02:39:38,750 --> 02:39:38,760
describe basically how matter gets
 

8571
02:39:38,760 --> 02:39:40,790
describe basically how matter gets
pushed around and how electromagnetism

8572
02:39:40,790 --> 02:39:40,800
pushed around and how electromagnetism
 

8573
02:39:40,800 --> 02:39:43,010
pushed around and how electromagnetism
Works holy cow what a feat

8574
02:39:43,010 --> 02:39:43,020
Works holy cow what a feat
 

8575
02:39:43,020 --> 02:39:45,410
Works holy cow what a feat
there are these few nagging things

8576
02:39:45,410 --> 02:39:45,420
there are these few nagging things
 

8577
02:39:45,420 --> 02:39:48,110
there are these few nagging things
like for instance there's certain kinds

8578
02:39:48,110 --> 02:39:48,120
like for instance there's certain kinds
 

8579
02:39:48,120 --> 02:39:50,030
like for instance there's certain kinds
of rocks that for some reason like if

8580
02:39:50,030 --> 02:39:50,040
of rocks that for some reason like if
 

8581
02:39:50,040 --> 02:39:51,830
of rocks that for some reason like if
you put a photographic plate around it

8582
02:39:51,830 --> 02:39:51,840
you put a photographic plate around it
 

8583
02:39:51,840 --> 02:39:54,230
you put a photographic plate around it
it like it's burned or it gets an image

8584
02:39:54,230 --> 02:39:54,240
it like it's burned or it gets an image
 

8585
02:39:54,240 --> 02:39:56,750
it like it's burned or it gets an image
on it like well where's the

8586
02:39:56,750 --> 02:39:56,760
on it like well where's the
 

8587
02:39:56,760 --> 02:39:58,670
on it like well where's the
electromagnetism in that there's no

8588
02:39:58,670 --> 02:39:58,680
electromagnetism in that there's no
 

8589
02:39:58,680 --> 02:40:01,610
electromagnetism in that there's no
electromagnetic properties of this rock

8590
02:40:01,610 --> 02:40:01,620
electromagnetic properties of this rock
 

8591
02:40:01,620 --> 02:40:03,469
electromagnetic properties of this rock
oh yeah and the other thing too is that

8592
02:40:03,469 --> 02:40:03,479
oh yeah and the other thing too is that
 

8593
02:40:03,479 --> 02:40:05,929
oh yeah and the other thing too is that
if I if I take this wonderful classical

8594
02:40:05,929 --> 02:40:05,939
if I if I take this wonderful classical
 

8595
02:40:05,939 --> 02:40:09,050
if I if I take this wonderful classical
derivation of how a a something that is

8596
02:40:09,050 --> 02:40:09,060
derivation of how a a something that is
 

8597
02:40:09,060 --> 02:40:12,469
derivation of how a a something that is
hot about how it releases radiation

8598
02:40:12,469 --> 02:40:12,479
hot about how it releases radiation
 

8599
02:40:12,479 --> 02:40:14,690
hot about how it releases radiation
everything looks fantastic perfect match

8600
02:40:14,690 --> 02:40:14,700
everything looks fantastic perfect match
 

8601
02:40:14,700 --> 02:40:18,889
everything looks fantastic perfect match
oh until I get to high frequencies

8602
02:40:18,889 --> 02:40:18,899
oh until I get to high frequencies
 

8603
02:40:18,899 --> 02:40:21,170
oh until I get to high frequencies
of the light and then it basically just

8604
02:40:21,170 --> 02:40:21,180
of the light and then it basically just
 

8605
02:40:21,180 --> 02:40:23,330
of the light and then it basically just
the whole thing falls apart in fact it

8606
02:40:23,330 --> 02:40:23,340
the whole thing falls apart in fact it
 

8607
02:40:23,340 --> 02:40:25,190
the whole thing falls apart in fact it
gives a physical explanation which is

8608
02:40:25,190 --> 02:40:25,200
gives a physical explanation which is
 

8609
02:40:25,200 --> 02:40:27,349
gives a physical explanation which is
total nonsense it tells you that every

8610
02:40:27,349 --> 02:40:27,359
total nonsense it tells you that every
 

8611
02:40:27,359 --> 02:40:29,870
total nonsense it tells you that every
object should basically be producing an

8612
02:40:29,870 --> 02:40:29,880
object should basically be producing an
 

8613
02:40:29,880 --> 02:40:32,570
object should basically be producing an
infinite amount of heat and by the way

8614
02:40:32,570 --> 02:40:32,580
infinite amount of heat and by the way
 

8615
02:40:32,580 --> 02:40:35,330
infinite amount of heat and by the way
here's the Sun and we can look at the

8616
02:40:35,330 --> 02:40:35,340
here's the Sun and we can look at the
 

8617
02:40:35,340 --> 02:40:37,309
here's the Sun and we can look at the
Sun and we can figure out it's made out

8618
02:40:37,309 --> 02:40:37,319
Sun and we can figure out it's made out
 

8619
02:40:37,319 --> 02:40:39,110
Sun and we can figure out it's made out
of hydrogen and Lord Kelvin actually

8620
02:40:39,110 --> 02:40:39,120
of hydrogen and Lord Kelvin actually
 

8621
02:40:39,120 --> 02:40:41,270
of hydrogen and Lord Kelvin actually
made a very famous you know calculation

8622
02:40:41,270 --> 02:40:41,280
made a very famous you know calculation
 

8623
02:40:41,280 --> 02:40:42,889
made a very famous you know calculation
who was basically one of the founders of

8624
02:40:42,889 --> 02:40:42,899
who was basically one of the founders of
 

8625
02:40:42,899 --> 02:40:45,110
who was basically one of the founders of
thermodynamics so you look at the

8626
02:40:45,110 --> 02:40:45,120
thermodynamics so you look at the
 

8627
02:40:45,120 --> 02:40:47,389
thermodynamics so you look at the
hydrogen hydrogen has a certain energy

8628
02:40:47,389 --> 02:40:47,399
hydrogen hydrogen has a certain energy
 

8629
02:40:47,399 --> 02:40:49,010
hydrogen hydrogen has a certain energy
content that you know the latent heat

8630
02:40:49,010 --> 02:40:49,020
content that you know the latent heat
 

8631
02:40:49,020 --> 02:40:51,050
content that you know the latent heat
basically of hydrogen we know the mass

8632
02:40:51,050 --> 02:40:51,060
basically of hydrogen we know the mass
 

8633
02:40:51,060 --> 02:40:52,790
basically of hydrogen we know the mass
of the sun because we knew the size of

8634
02:40:52,790 --> 02:40:52,800
of the sun because we knew the size of
 

8635
02:40:52,800 --> 02:40:55,010
of the sun because we knew the size of
it and he conclusively proved that

8636
02:40:55,010 --> 02:40:55,020
it and he conclusively proved that
 

8637
02:40:55,020 --> 02:40:57,469
it and he conclusively proved that
basically there could only the the sun

8638
02:40:57,469 --> 02:40:57,479
basically there could only the the sun
 

8639
02:40:57,479 --> 02:40:59,510
basically there could only the the sun
could only make net energy for about two

8640
02:40:59,510 --> 02:40:59,520
could only make net energy for about two
 

8641
02:40:59,520 --> 02:41:01,070
could only make net energy for about two
or three thousand years

8642
02:41:01,070 --> 02:41:01,080
or three thousand years
 

8643
02:41:01,080 --> 02:41:02,990
or three thousand years
so therefore all this nonsense about

8644
02:41:02,990 --> 02:41:03,000
so therefore all this nonsense about
 

8645
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:05,030
so therefore all this nonsense about
like deep is like because clearly the

8646
02:41:05,030 --> 02:41:05,040
like deep is like because clearly the
 

8647
02:41:05,040 --> 02:41:06,590
like deep is like because clearly the
sun can only last for two or three

8648
02:41:06,590 --> 02:41:06,600
sun can only last for two or three
 

8649
02:41:06,600 --> 02:41:08,270
sun can only last for two or three
thousand years if you think about the

8650
02:41:08,270 --> 02:41:08,280
thousand years if you think about the
 

8651
02:41:08,280 --> 02:41:09,650
thousand years if you think about the
captain this is basically the chemical

8652
02:41:09,650 --> 02:41:09,660
captain this is basically the chemical
 

8653
02:41:09,660 --> 02:41:11,809
captain this is basically the chemical
energy content of hydrogen and what

8654
02:41:11,809 --> 02:41:11,819
energy content of hydrogen and what
 

8655
02:41:11,819 --> 02:41:14,389
energy content of hydrogen and what
comes along in one decade

8656
02:41:14,389 --> 02:41:14,399
comes along in one decade
 

8657
02:41:14,399 --> 02:41:16,790
comes along in one decade
basically one guy sitting in a postal

8658
02:41:16,790 --> 02:41:16,800
basically one guy sitting in a postal
 

8659
02:41:16,800 --> 02:41:19,370
basically one guy sitting in a postal
office you know in Switzerland figures

8660
02:41:19,370 --> 02:41:19,380

this create like took these these

8666
02:41:26,389 --> 02:41:26,399
this create like took these these
 

8667
02:41:26,399 --> 02:41:28,370
this create like took these these
seemingly unconnected things and it's

8668
02:41:28,370 --> 02:41:28,380
seemingly unconnected things and it's
 

8669
02:41:28,380 --> 02:41:30,290
seemingly unconnected things and it's
like boom there it is this is what it

8670
02:41:30,290 --> 02:41:30,300
like boom there it is this is what it
 

8671
02:41:30,300 --> 02:41:31,670
like boom there it is this is what it
was interest him but it was like there's

8672
02:41:31,670 --> 02:41:31,680
was interest him but it was like there's
 

8673
02:41:31,680 --> 02:41:33,770
was interest him but it was like there's
quantum physics like this explains this

8674
02:41:33,770 --> 02:41:33,780
quantum physics like this explains this
 

8675
02:41:33,780 --> 02:41:35,870
quantum physics like this explains this
other disaster and then this other guy

8676
02:41:35,870 --> 02:41:35,880
other disaster and then this other guy
 

8677
02:41:35,880 --> 02:41:37,130

Ernest Rutherford experimentalist
 

8681
02:41:39,720 --> 02:41:41,870
Ernest Rutherford experimentalist
did the most extraordinary experiment

8682
02:41:41,870 --> 02:41:41,880
did the most extraordinary experiment
 

8683
02:41:41,880 --> 02:41:44,809
did the most extraordinary experiment
which is like which was that okay they

8684
02:41:44,809 --> 02:41:44,819
which is like which was that okay they
 

8685
02:41:44,819 --> 02:41:46,550
which is like which was that okay they
had these funny rocks they emitted these

8686
02:41:46,550 --> 02:41:46,560
had these funny rocks they emitted these
 

8687
02:41:46,560 --> 02:41:48,050
had these funny rocks they emitted these
particles in fact they called them alpha

8688
02:41:48,050 --> 02:41:48,060
particles in fact they called them alpha
 

8689
02:41:48,060 --> 02:41:50,270
particles in fact they called them alpha
particles Alpha just a in the alphabet

8690
02:41:50,270 --> 02:41:50,280
particles Alpha just a in the alphabet
 

8691
02:41:50,280 --> 02:41:51,410
particles Alpha just a in the alphabet
right because it was the first thing

8692
02:41:51,410 --> 02:41:51,420
right because it was the first thing
 

8693
02:41:51,420 --> 02:41:52,730
right because it was the first thing
that they discovered

8694
02:41:52,730 --> 02:41:52,740
that they discovered
 

8695
02:41:52,740 --> 02:41:54,410
that they discovered
and what were they doing so they were

8696
02:41:54,410 --> 02:41:54,420
and what were they doing so they were
 

8697
02:41:54,420 --> 02:41:56,809
and what were they doing so they were
they were taking these alpha particles

8698
02:41:56,809 --> 02:41:56,819
they were taking these alpha particles
 

8699
02:41:56,819 --> 02:41:58,490
they were taking these alpha particles
and I by the way I do this to all my

8700
02:41:58,490 --> 02:41:58,500
and I by the way I do this to all my
 

8701
02:41:58,500 --> 02:42:00,230
and I by the way I do this to all my
students because it's a demonstration of

8702
02:42:00,230 --> 02:42:00,240
students because it's a demonstration of
 

8703
02:42:00,240 --> 02:42:02,090
students because it's a demonstration of
what you should be as a good scientist

8704
02:42:02,090 --> 02:42:02,100
what you should be as a good scientist
 

8705
02:42:02,100 --> 02:42:04,250
what you should be as a good scientist
so he took these Alpha things and he was

8706
02:42:04,250 --> 02:42:04,260
so he took these Alpha things and he was
 

8707
02:42:04,260 --> 02:42:05,990
so he took these Alpha things and he was
classically trained physicists knew

8708
02:42:05,990 --> 02:42:06,000
classically trained physicists knew
 

8709
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:07,849
classically trained physicists knew
everything about momentum scattering and

8710
02:42:07,849 --> 02:42:07,859
everything about momentum scattering and
 

8711
02:42:07,859 --> 02:42:10,309
everything about momentum scattering and
so forth like that and he took this and

8712
02:42:10,309 --> 02:42:10,319
so forth like that and he took this and
 

8713
02:42:10,319 --> 02:42:12,710
so forth like that and he took this and
these Alpha which clearly were some kind

8714
02:42:12,710 --> 02:42:12,720
these Alpha which clearly were some kind
 

8715
02:42:12,720 --> 02:42:14,150
these Alpha which clearly were some kind
of energy but they couldn't quite figure

8716
02:42:14,150 --> 02:42:14,160
of energy but they couldn't quite figure
 

8717
02:42:14,160 --> 02:42:15,710
of energy but they couldn't quite figure
out what it was so so let's try to

8718
02:42:15,710 --> 02:42:15,720
out what it was so so let's try to
 

8719
02:42:15,720 --> 02:42:16,969
out what it was so so let's try to
figure that we'll actually use this to

8720
02:42:16,969 --> 02:42:16,979
figure that we'll actually use this to
 

8721
02:42:16,979 --> 02:42:19,070
figure that we'll actually use this to
try to probe the nature matter so he

8722
02:42:19,070 --> 02:42:19,080
try to probe the nature matter so he
 

8723
02:42:19,080 --> 02:42:20,030
try to probe the nature matter so he
took this

8724
02:42:20,030 --> 02:42:20,040
took this
 

8725
02:42:20,040 --> 02:42:23,030
took this
to these alpha particles and a very very

8726
02:42:23,030 --> 02:42:23,040
to these alpha particles and a very very
 

8727
02:42:23,040 --> 02:42:25,490
to these alpha particles and a very very
thin gold foil and so what you wanted to

8728
02:42:25,490 --> 02:42:25,500
thin gold foil and so what you wanted to
 

8729
02:42:25,500 --> 02:42:27,110
thin gold foil and so what you wanted to
see was that as they were going through

8730
02:42:27,110 --> 02:42:27,120
see was that as they were going through
 

8731
02:42:27,120 --> 02:42:29,210
see was that as they were going through
the way that they would scatter based on

8732
02:42:29,210 --> 02:42:29,220
the way that they would scatter based on
 

8733
02:42:29,220 --> 02:42:30,950
the way that they would scatter based on
classical in fact a coulomb collision

8734
02:42:30,950 --> 02:42:30,960
classical in fact a coulomb collision
 

8735
02:42:30,960 --> 02:42:33,410
classical in fact a coulomb collision
based on classical mechanics this will

8736
02:42:33,410 --> 02:42:33,420
based on classical mechanics this will
 

8737
02:42:33,420 --> 02:42:36,590
based on classical mechanics this will
tell me reveal something about what the

8738
02:42:36,590 --> 02:42:36,600
tell me reveal something about what the
 

8739
02:42:36,600 --> 02:42:38,510
tell me reveal something about what the
nature of the charge distribution is in

8740
02:42:38,510 --> 02:42:38,520
nature of the charge distribution is in
 

8741
02:42:38,520 --> 02:42:40,370
nature of the charge distribution is in
matter because they didn't know like

8742
02:42:40,370 --> 02:42:40,380
matter because they didn't know like
 

8743
02:42:40,380 --> 02:42:41,870
matter because they didn't know like
where the hell is this stuff coming from

8744
02:42:41,870 --> 02:42:41,880
where the hell is this stuff coming from
 

8745
02:42:41,880 --> 02:42:43,010
where the hell is this stuff coming from
even though they solved that

8746
02:42:43,010 --> 02:42:43,020
even though they solved that
 

8747
02:42:43,020 --> 02:42:45,110
even though they solved that
electromagnetism they didn't know like

8748
02:42:45,110 --> 02:42:45,120
electromagnetism they didn't know like
 

8749
02:42:45,120 --> 02:42:47,510
electromagnetism they didn't know like
what made up charges okay very

8750
02:42:47,510 --> 02:42:47,520
what made up charges okay very
 

8751
02:42:47,520 --> 02:42:49,929
what made up charges okay very
interesting on through it goes

8752
02:42:49,929 --> 02:42:49,939
interesting on through it goes
 

8753
02:42:49,939 --> 02:42:52,490
interesting on through it goes
and so what did you set up so it turns

8754
02:42:52,490 --> 02:42:52,500
and so what did you set up so it turns
 

8755
02:42:52,500 --> 02:42:54,110
and so what did you set up so it turns
out in the in these experiments what you

8756
02:42:54,110 --> 02:42:54,120
out in the in these experiments what you
 

8757
02:42:54,120 --> 02:42:56,690
out in the in these experiments what you
did was because if these out these

8758
02:42:56,690 --> 02:42:56,700
did was because if these out these
 

8759
02:42:56,700 --> 02:42:58,910
did was because if these out these
so-called Alphas which actually now we

8760
02:42:58,910 --> 02:42:58,920
so-called Alphas which actually now we
 

8761
02:42:58,920 --> 02:43:01,429
so-called Alphas which actually now we
know is something else as they go

8762
02:43:01,429 --> 02:43:01,439
know is something else as they go
 

8763
02:43:01,439 --> 02:43:03,349
know is something else as they go
through they would deflect how much they

8764
02:43:03,349 --> 02:43:03,359
through they would deflect how much they
 

8765
02:43:03,359 --> 02:43:04,849
through they would deflect how much they
deflect tells you how strong an electric

8766
02:43:04,849 --> 02:43:04,859
deflect tells you how strong an electric
 

8767
02:43:04,859 --> 02:43:07,250
deflect tells you how strong an electric
field they saw so you put detectors

8768
02:43:07,250 --> 02:43:07,260
field they saw so you put detectors
 

8769
02:43:07,260 --> 02:43:08,690
field they saw so you put detectors
because if you put if you put like a

8770
02:43:08,690 --> 02:43:08,700
because if you put if you put like a
 

8771
02:43:08,700 --> 02:43:10,730
because if you put if you put like a
piece of glass in front of this what

8772
02:43:10,730 --> 02:43:10,740
piece of glass in front of this what
 

8773
02:43:10,740 --> 02:43:11,929
piece of glass in front of this what
will happen is that when the alpha

8774
02:43:11,929 --> 02:43:11,939
will happen is that when the alpha
 

8775
02:43:11,939 --> 02:43:13,370
will happen is that when the alpha
particle hits it literally gives a

8776
02:43:13,370 --> 02:43:13,380
particle hits it literally gives a
 

8777
02:43:13,380 --> 02:43:15,530
particle hits it literally gives a
little a little bit of light like this

8778
02:43:15,530 --> 02:43:15,540
little a little bit of light like this
 

8779
02:43:15,540 --> 02:43:18,410
little a little bit of light like this
it's scintillates a little blue flash so

8780
02:43:18,410 --> 02:43:18,420
it's scintillates a little blue flash so
 

8781
02:43:18,420 --> 02:43:20,330
it's scintillates a little blue flash so
he would train his students or post like

8782
02:43:20,330 --> 02:43:20,340
he would train his students or post like
 

8783
02:43:20,340 --> 02:43:21,590
he would train his students or post like
whatever the heck they were at the time

8784
02:43:21,590 --> 02:43:21,600
whatever the heck they were at the time
 

8785
02:43:21,600 --> 02:43:23,150
whatever the heck they were at the time
you have to train yourself because you

8786
02:43:23,150 --> 02:43:23,160
you have to train yourself because you
 

8787
02:43:23,160 --> 02:43:24,710
you have to train yourself because you
have to put yourself in the dark for

8788
02:43:24,710 --> 02:43:24,720
have to put yourself in the dark for
 

8789
02:43:24,720 --> 02:43:27,290
have to put yourself in the dark for
like hours to get your eyes adjusted and

8790
02:43:27,290 --> 02:43:27,300
like hours to get your eyes adjusted and
 

8791
02:43:27,300 --> 02:43:28,610
like hours to get your eyes adjusted and
then they would start the experiment and

8792
02:43:28,610 --> 02:43:28,620
then they would start the experiment and
 

8793
02:43:28,620 --> 02:43:29,870
then they would start the experiment and
they would sit there and literally count

8794
02:43:29,870 --> 02:43:29,880
they would sit there and literally count
 

8795
02:43:29,880 --> 02:43:31,790
they would sit there and literally count
the things and they could see this

8796
02:43:31,790 --> 02:43:31,800
the things and they could see this
 

8797
02:43:31,800 --> 02:43:33,410
the things and they could see this
pattern developing which was revealing

8798
02:43:33,410 --> 02:43:33,420
pattern developing which was revealing
 

8799
02:43:33,420 --> 02:43:35,929
pattern developing which was revealing
about what was going on but there was

8800
02:43:35,929 --> 02:43:35,939
about what was going on but there was
 

8801
02:43:35,939 --> 02:43:37,309
about what was going on but there was
also another part to the experiment

8802
02:43:37,309 --> 02:43:37,319
also another part to the experiment
 

8803
02:43:37,319 --> 02:43:38,870
also another part to the experiment
which was that

8804
02:43:38,870 --> 02:43:38,880
which was that
 

8805
02:43:38,880 --> 02:43:41,690
which was that
it's like here's the alphas here's the

8806
02:43:41,690 --> 02:43:41,700
it's like here's the alphas here's the
 

8807
02:43:41,700 --> 02:43:43,610
it's like here's the alphas here's the
source they're going this way they could

8808
02:43:43,610 --> 02:43:43,620
source they're going this way they could
 

8809
02:43:43,620 --> 02:43:44,630
source they're going this way they could
tell they were going in One Direction

8810
02:43:44,630 --> 02:43:44,640
tell they were going in One Direction
 

8811
02:43:44,640 --> 02:43:45,950
tell they were going in One Direction
only basically they're going in this

8812
02:43:45,950 --> 02:43:45,960
only basically they're going in this
 

8813
02:43:45,960 --> 02:43:47,210
only basically they're going in this
direction

8814
02:43:47,210 --> 02:43:47,220
direction
 

8815
02:43:47,220 --> 02:43:48,770
direction
and you put all these over here because

8816
02:43:48,770 --> 02:43:48,780
and you put all these over here because
 

8817
02:43:48,780 --> 02:43:49,969
and you put all these over here because
you want to see how they deflect and

8818
02:43:49,969 --> 02:43:49,979
you want to see how they deflect and
 

8819
02:43:49,979 --> 02:43:51,950
you want to see how they deflect and
bend through it but you put a control in

8820
02:43:51,950 --> 02:43:51,960
bend through it but you put a control in
 

8821
02:43:51,960 --> 02:43:54,170
bend through it but you put a control in
the experiment but you basically put

8822
02:43:54,170 --> 02:43:54,180
the experiment but you basically put
 

8823
02:43:54,180 --> 02:43:57,530
the experiment but you basically put
glass particle glass glass plates back

8824
02:43:57,530 --> 02:43:57,540
glass particle glass glass plates back
 

8825
02:43:57,540 --> 02:44:00,349
glass particle glass glass plates back
here because obviously everything should

8826
02:44:00,349 --> 02:44:00,359
here because obviously everything should
 

8827
02:44:00,359 --> 02:44:01,849
here because obviously everything should
just deflect but nothing should bounce

8828
02:44:01,849 --> 02:44:01,859
just deflect but nothing should bounce
 

8829
02:44:01,859 --> 02:44:05,210
just deflect but nothing should bounce
back so it's a controlling experiment

8830
02:44:05,210 --> 02:44:05,220
back so it's a controlling experiment
 

8831
02:44:05,220 --> 02:44:07,670
back so it's a controlling experiment
but what did they see

8832
02:44:07,670 --> 02:44:07,680
but what did they see
 

8833
02:44:07,680 --> 02:44:10,969
but what did they see
they saw things bouncing back

8834
02:44:10,969 --> 02:44:10,979
they saw things bouncing back
 

8835
02:44:10,979 --> 02:44:12,650
they saw things bouncing back
like what the hell

8836
02:44:12,650 --> 02:44:12,660
like what the hell
 

8837
02:44:12,660 --> 02:44:16,370
like what the hell
like that fit no model of any idea right

8838
02:44:16,370 --> 02:44:16,380
like that fit no model of any idea right
 

8839
02:44:16,380 --> 02:44:19,309
like that fit no model of any idea right
but Rutherford like refused to like

8840
02:44:19,309 --> 02:44:19,319
but Rutherford like refused to like
 

8841
02:44:19,319 --> 02:44:22,010
but Rutherford like refused to like
ignore what was a clear like they

8842
02:44:22,010 --> 02:44:22,020
ignore what was a clear like they
 

8843
02:44:22,020 --> 02:44:24,650
ignore what was a clear like they
validated it and he sat down and based

8844
02:44:24,650 --> 02:44:24,660
validated it and he sat down and based
 

8845
02:44:24,660 --> 02:44:26,630
validated it and he sat down and based
on classical physics he made the most

8846
02:44:26,630 --> 02:44:26,640
on classical physics he made the most
 

8847
02:44:26,640 --> 02:44:29,090
on classical physics he made the most
extraordinary discovery which was the

8848
02:44:29,090 --> 02:44:29,100
extraordinary discovery which was the
 

8849
02:44:29,100 --> 02:44:30,349
extraordinary discovery which was the
nucleus

8850
02:44:30,349 --> 02:44:30,359
nucleus
 

8851
02:44:30,359 --> 02:44:32,929
nucleus
which is a very very strange Discovery

8852
02:44:32,929 --> 02:44:32,939
which is a very very strange Discovery
 

8853
02:44:32,939 --> 02:44:35,090
which is a very very strange Discovery
what what I mean by that because what he

8854
02:44:35,090 --> 02:44:35,100
what what I mean by that because what he
 

8855
02:44:35,100 --> 02:44:36,590
what what I mean by that because what he
could figure out from this is that in

8856
02:44:36,590 --> 02:44:36,600
could figure out from this is that in
 

8857
02:44:36,600 --> 02:44:39,290
could figure out from this is that in
order for these particles to bounce back

8858
02:44:39,290 --> 02:44:39,300
order for these particles to bounce back
 

8859
02:44:39,300 --> 02:44:41,630
order for these particles to bounce back
and hit this plate they were hitting

8860
02:44:41,630 --> 02:44:41,640
and hit this plate they were hitting
 

8861
02:44:41,640 --> 02:44:44,510
and hit this plate they were hitting
something that must be heavier than them

8862
02:44:44,510 --> 02:44:44,520
something that must be heavier than them
 

8863
02:44:44,520 --> 02:44:47,710
something that must be heavier than them
and that that basically something like

8864
02:44:47,710 --> 02:44:47,720
and that that basically something like
 

8865
02:44:47,720 --> 02:44:51,410
and that that basically something like
99.999 of the mass of the matter that

8866
02:44:51,410 --> 02:44:51,420
99.999 of the mass of the matter that
 

8867
02:44:51,420 --> 02:44:53,389
99.999 of the mass of the matter that
was in this gold foil was in something

8868
02:44:53,389 --> 02:44:53,399
was in this gold foil was in something
 

8869
02:44:53,399 --> 02:44:56,510
was in this gold foil was in something
that contained about one trillionth of

8870
02:44:56,510 --> 02:44:56,520
that contained about one trillionth of
 

8871
02:44:56,520 --> 02:44:58,370
that contained about one trillionth of
the volume of it

8872
02:44:58,370 --> 02:44:58,380
the volume of it
 

8873
02:44:58,380 --> 02:45:00,590
the volume of it
and that's called the nucleus

8874
02:45:00,590 --> 02:45:00,600
and that's called the nucleus
 

8875
02:45:00,600 --> 02:45:03,110
and that's called the nucleus
and until and you talk about so how

8876
02:45:03,110 --> 02:45:03,120
and until and you talk about so how
 

8877
02:45:03,120 --> 02:45:05,630
and until and you talk about so how
revealing is this is like this totally

8878
02:45:05,630 --> 02:45:05,640
revealing is this is like this totally
 

8879
02:45:05,640 --> 02:45:07,730
revealing is this is like this totally
changes your idea of the universe

8880
02:45:07,730 --> 02:45:07,740
changes your idea of the universe
 

8881
02:45:07,740 --> 02:45:10,429
changes your idea of the universe
because a nucleus is a very unintuitive

8882
02:45:10,429 --> 02:45:10,439
because a nucleus is a very unintuitive
 

8883
02:45:10,439 --> 02:45:12,889
because a nucleus is a very unintuitive
non-intuitive thing it's like why is all

8884
02:45:12,889 --> 02:45:12,899
non-intuitive thing it's like why is all
 

8885
02:45:12,899 --> 02:45:15,650
non-intuitive thing it's like why is all
the mass in something that is like zero

8886
02:45:15,650 --> 02:45:15,660
the mass in something that is like zero
 

8887
02:45:15,660 --> 02:45:17,450
the mass in something that is like zero
like it basically is the realization

8888
02:45:17,450 --> 02:45:17,460
like it basically is the realization
 

8889
02:45:17,460 --> 02:45:20,150
like it basically is the realization
that matter is empty it's all empty

8890
02:45:20,150 --> 02:45:20,160
that matter is empty it's all empty
 

8891
02:45:20,160 --> 02:45:22,670
that matter is empty it's all empty
space and that changes everything and it

8892
02:45:22,670 --> 02:45:22,680
space and that changes everything and it
 

8893
02:45:22,680 --> 02:45:25,070
space and that changes everything and it
changes everything until you had that

8894
02:45:25,070 --> 02:45:25,080
changes everything until you had that
 

8895
02:45:25,080 --> 02:45:26,690
changes everything until you had that
like you had steam engines by the way

8896
02:45:26,690 --> 02:45:26,700
like you had steam engines by the way
 

8897
02:45:26,700 --> 02:45:28,190
like you had steam engines by the way
you had Telegraph wires you had all

8898
02:45:28,190 --> 02:45:28,200
you had Telegraph wires you had all
 

8899
02:45:28,200 --> 02:45:30,710
you had Telegraph wires you had all
those things but that that realization

8900
02:45:30,710 --> 02:45:30,720
those things but that that realization
 

8901
02:45:30,720 --> 02:45:32,570
those things but that that realization
like opened up those two realization

8902
02:45:32,570 --> 02:45:32,580
like opened up those two realization
 

8903
02:45:32,580 --> 02:45:35,870
like opened up those two realization
opened up everything like lasers every

8904
02:45:35,870 --> 02:45:35,880
opened up everything like lasers every
 

8905
02:45:35,880 --> 02:45:37,370
opened up everything like lasers every
all you think about the modern world of

8906
02:45:37,370 --> 02:45:37,380
all you think about the modern world of
 

8907
02:45:37,380 --> 02:45:38,410
all you think about the modern world of
what we use

8908
02:45:38,410 --> 02:45:38,420
what we use
 

8909
02:45:38,420 --> 02:45:41,030
what we use
and that set it up so all I would point

8910
02:45:41,030 --> 02:45:41,040
and that set it up so all I would point
 

8911
02:45:41,040 --> 02:45:43,070
and that set it up so all I would point
out is that there's a story already that

8912
02:45:43,070 --> 02:45:43,080
out is that there's a story already that
 

8913
02:45:43,080 --> 02:45:44,690
out is that there's a story already that
sometimes there's these nagging things

8914
02:45:44,690 --> 02:45:44,700
sometimes there's these nagging things
 

8915
02:45:44,700 --> 02:45:47,389
sometimes there's these nagging things
at the edge of science that you know we

8916
02:45:47,389 --> 02:45:47,399
at the edge of science that you know we
 

8917
02:45:47,399 --> 02:45:49,730
at the edge of science that you know we
seem we Pat ourselves on the back and we

8918
02:45:49,730 --> 02:45:49,740
seem we Pat ourselves on the back and we
 

8919
02:45:49,740 --> 02:45:50,990
seem we Pat ourselves on the back and we
think we got everything under control

8920
02:45:50,990 --> 02:45:51,000
think we got everything under control
 

8921
02:45:51,000 --> 02:45:53,450
think we got everything under control
and of course that by the way that was

8922
02:45:53,450 --> 02:45:53,460
and of course that by the way that was
 

8923
02:45:53,460 --> 02:45:55,849
and of course that by the way that was
the origin of also that that it think

8924
02:45:55,849 --> 02:45:55,859
the origin of also that that it think
 

8925
02:45:55,859 --> 02:45:58,010
the origin of also that that it think
about this that was 1908 it took like

8926
02:45:58,010 --> 02:45:58,020
about this that was 1908 it took like
 

8927
02:45:58,020 --> 02:46:00,889
about this that was 1908 it took like
another 20 some years

8928
02:46:00,889 --> 02:46:00,899
another 20 some years
 

8929
02:46:00,899 --> 02:46:02,990
another 20 some years
before people put that together with

8930
02:46:02,990 --> 02:46:03,000
before people put that together with
 

8931
02:46:03,000 --> 02:46:06,530
before people put that together with
that's the process that's powering Stars

8932
02:46:06,530 --> 02:46:06,540
that's the process that's powering Stars
 

8933
02:46:06,540 --> 02:46:08,750
that's the process that's powering Stars
is the rearrangement of those nuclei not

8934
02:46:08,750 --> 02:46:08,760
is the rearrangement of those nuclei not
 

8935
02:46:08,760 --> 02:46:11,809
is the rearrangement of those nuclei not
atoms that's why Kelvin wasn't wrong he

8936
02:46:11,809 --> 02:46:11,819
atoms that's why Kelvin wasn't wrong he
 

8937
02:46:11,819 --> 02:46:13,010
atoms that's why Kelvin wasn't wrong he
just he was working with the wrong

8938
02:46:13,010 --> 02:46:13,020
just he was working with the wrong
 

8939
02:46:13,020 --> 02:46:15,530
just he was working with the wrong
assumptions right so of the fast forward

8940
02:46:15,530 --> 02:46:15,540
assumptions right so of the fast forward
 

8941
02:46:15,540 --> 02:46:17,330
assumptions right so of the fast forward
to today like what would this mean right

8942
02:46:17,330 --> 02:46:17,340
to today like what would this mean right
 

8943
02:46:17,340 --> 02:46:18,830
to today like what would this mean right
well there's a couple of things like

8944
02:46:18,830 --> 02:46:18,840
well there's a couple of things like
 

8945
02:46:18,840 --> 02:46:20,809
well there's a couple of things like
this that sit out there in physics and

8946
02:46:20,809 --> 02:46:20,819
this that sit out there in physics and
 

8947
02:46:20,819 --> 02:46:22,250
this that sit out there in physics and
I'll point out one of them which is very

8948
02:46:22,250 --> 02:46:22,260
I'll point out one of them which is very
 

8949
02:46:22,260 --> 02:46:24,050
I'll point out one of them which is very
interesting we don't know what the hell

8950
02:46:24,050 --> 02:46:24,060
interesting we don't know what the hell
 

8951
02:46:24,060 --> 02:46:26,389
interesting we don't know what the hell
makes up 90 of the mass in the universe

8952
02:46:26,389 --> 02:46:26,399
makes up 90 of the mass in the universe
 

8953
02:46:26,399 --> 02:46:28,550
makes up 90 of the mass in the universe
so that you know the search for dark

8954
02:46:28,550 --> 02:46:28,560
so that you know the search for dark
 

8955
02:46:28,560 --> 02:46:30,889
so that you know the search for dark
matter right what is it we still haven't

8956
02:46:30,889 --> 02:46:30,899
matter right what is it we still haven't
 

8957
02:46:30,899 --> 02:46:33,410
matter right what is it we still haven't
discovered it yeah ninety percent of the

8958
02:46:33,410 --> 02:46:33,420
discovered it yeah ninety percent of the
 

8959
02:46:33,420 --> 02:46:36,950
discovered it yeah ninety percent of the
mass of the universe is undetectable

8960
02:46:36,950 --> 02:46:36,960
mass of the universe is undetectable
 

8961
02:46:36,960 --> 02:46:39,530
mass of the universe is undetectable
like what and then you know then dark

8962
02:46:39,530 --> 02:46:39,540
like what and then you know then dark
 

8963
02:46:39,540 --> 02:46:41,750
like what and then you know then dark
energy and again black holes are the the

8964
02:46:41,750 --> 02:46:41,760
energy and again black holes are the the
 

8965
02:46:41,760 --> 02:46:44,150
energy and again black holes are the the
window into this as well then black hole

8966
02:46:44,150 --> 02:46:44,160
window into this as well then black hole
 

8967
02:46:44,160 --> 02:46:45,830
window into this as well then black hole
I mean sometimes black holes are way

8968
02:46:45,830 --> 02:46:45,840
I mean sometimes black holes are way
 

8969
02:46:45,840 --> 02:46:48,349
I mean sometimes black holes are way
better understood than those things as

8970
02:46:48,349 --> 02:46:48,359
better understood than those things as
 

8971
02:46:48,359 --> 02:46:50,570
better understood than those things as
well too so all it tells us is that we

8972
02:46:50,570 --> 02:46:50,580
well too so all it tells us is that we
 

8973
02:46:50,580 --> 02:46:52,370
well too so all it tells us is that we
shouldn't have hubris about the ideas

8974
02:46:52,370 --> 02:46:52,380
shouldn't have hubris about the ideas
 

8975
02:46:52,380 --> 02:46:54,770
shouldn't have hubris about the ideas
that we understand everything and when

8976
02:46:54,770 --> 02:46:54,780
that we understand everything and when
 

8977
02:46:54,780 --> 02:46:56,750
that we understand everything and when
we you know who knows what other the

8978
02:46:56,750 --> 02:46:56,760
we you know who knows what other the
 

8979
02:46:56,760 --> 02:46:59,809
we you know who knows what other the
next major intellectual Insight will be

8980
02:46:59,809 --> 02:46:59,819
next major intellectual Insight will be
 

8981
02:46:59,819 --> 02:47:01,370
next major intellectual Insight will be
about how the universe you know

8982
02:47:01,370 --> 02:47:01,380
about how the universe you know
 

8983
02:47:01,380 --> 02:47:03,770
about how the universe you know
functions and actually I think

8984
02:47:03,770 --> 02:47:03,780
functions and actually I think
 

8985
02:47:03,780 --> 02:47:06,710
functions and actually I think
Rutherford is the one who's attributed

8986
02:47:06,710 --> 02:47:06,720
Rutherford is the one who's attributed
 

8987
02:47:06,720 --> 02:47:08,690
Rutherford is the one who's attributed
at least that uh that quote that physics

8988
02:47:08,690 --> 02:47:08,700
at least that uh that quote that physics
 

8989
02:47:08,700 --> 02:47:10,910
at least that uh that quote that physics
is the only real science everything else

8990
02:47:10,910 --> 02:47:10,920
is the only real science everything else
 

8991
02:47:10,920 --> 02:47:13,670
is the only real science everything else
is stamp collecting right so uh there's

8992
02:47:13,670 --> 02:47:13,680
is stamp collecting right so uh there's
 

8993
02:47:13,680 --> 02:47:15,469
is stamp collecting right so uh there's
I'm so he's my hero but I'll slightly

8994
02:47:15,469 --> 02:47:15,479
I'm so he's my hero but I'll slightly
 

8995
02:47:15,479 --> 02:47:17,710
I'm so he's my hero but I'll slightly
disagree with that yes

8996
02:47:17,710 --> 02:47:17,720
disagree with that yes
 

8997
02:47:17,720 --> 02:47:20,270
disagree with that yes
well no off has a stamp collected that's

8998
02:47:20,270 --> 02:47:20,280
well no off has a stamp collected that's
 

8999
02:47:20,280 --> 02:47:21,490
well no off has a stamp collected that's
very important too

9000
02:47:21,490 --> 02:47:21,500
very important too
 

9001
02:47:21,500 --> 02:47:23,450
very important too
but you know that you have to have

9002
02:47:23,450 --> 02:47:23,460
but you know that you have to have
 

9003
02:47:23,460 --> 02:47:25,550
but you know that you have to have
humility about the kind of disciplines

9004
02:47:25,550 --> 02:47:25,560
humility about the kind of disciplines
 

9005
02:47:25,560 --> 02:47:27,770
humility about the kind of disciplines
that make progress at every stage in in

9006
02:47:27,770 --> 02:47:27,780
that make progress at every stage in in
 

9007
02:47:27,780 --> 02:47:30,590
that make progress at every stage in in
science in in science yeah that physics

9008
02:47:30,590 --> 02:47:30,600
science in in science yeah that physics
 

9009
02:47:30,600 --> 02:47:32,389
science in in science yeah that physics
did make a huge amount of progress in

9010
02:47:32,389 --> 02:47:32,399
did make a huge amount of progress in
 

9011
02:47:32,399 --> 02:47:34,309
did make a huge amount of progress in
the 20th century but it's possible that

9012
02:47:34,309 --> 02:47:34,319
the 20th century but it's possible that
 

9013
02:47:34,319 --> 02:47:35,990
the 20th century but it's possible that
other disciplines start to step in yeah

9014
02:47:35,990 --> 02:47:36,000
other disciplines start to step in yeah
 

9015
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:37,910
other disciplines start to step in yeah
but Rutherford couldn't imagine like

9016
02:47:37,910 --> 02:47:37,920
but Rutherford couldn't imagine like
 

9017
02:47:37,920 --> 02:47:39,590
but Rutherford couldn't imagine like
mapping the human genome because we

9018
02:47:39,590 --> 02:47:39,600
mapping the human genome because we
 

9019
02:47:39,600 --> 02:47:41,630
mapping the human genome because we
didn't even know about DNA yeah or

9020
02:47:41,630 --> 02:47:41,640
didn't even know about DNA yeah or
 

9021
02:47:41,640 --> 02:47:43,429
didn't even know about DNA yeah or
computers really or computer you really

9022
02:47:43,429 --> 02:47:43,439
computers really or computer you really
 

9023
02:47:43,439 --> 02:47:44,690
computers really or computer you really
probably didn't think deeply about

9024
02:47:44,690 --> 02:47:44,700
probably didn't think deeply about
 

9025
02:47:44,700 --> 02:47:46,790
probably didn't think deeply about
computation it's like is it here's

9026
02:47:46,790 --> 02:47:46,800
computation it's like is it here's
 

9027
02:47:46,800 --> 02:47:48,650
computation it's like is it here's
here's a wild one what if like the next

9028
02:47:48,650 --> 02:47:48,660
here's a wild one what if like the next
 

9029
02:47:48,660 --> 02:47:49,790
here's a wild one what if like the next
great

9030
02:47:49,790 --> 02:47:49,800
great
 

9031
02:47:49,800 --> 02:47:52,490
great
Revelation to humanity about the

9032
02:47:52,490 --> 02:47:52,500
Revelation to humanity about the
 

9033
02:47:52,500 --> 02:47:54,469
Revelation to humanity about the
universe is not done by the human mind

9034
02:47:54,469 --> 02:47:54,479
universe is not done by the human mind
 

9035
02:47:54,479 --> 02:47:58,130
universe is not done by the human mind
that seems increasingly like more likely

9036
02:47:58,130 --> 02:47:58,140
that seems increasingly like more likely
 

9037
02:47:58,140 --> 02:47:59,870
that seems increasingly like more likely
and then you start to ask deep questions

9038
02:47:59,870 --> 02:47:59,880
and then you start to ask deep questions
 

9039
02:47:59,880 --> 02:48:02,389
and then you start to ask deep questions
about what is the purpose of science for

9040
02:48:02,389 --> 02:48:02,399
about what is the purpose of science for
 

9041
02:48:02,399 --> 02:48:03,410
about what is the purpose of science for
example

9042
02:48:03,410 --> 02:48:03,420
example
 

9043
02:48:03,420 --> 02:48:05,330
example
if

9044
02:48:05,330 --> 02:48:05,340
if
 

9045
02:48:05,340 --> 02:48:08,570
if
um AI system will design a nuclear

9046
02:48:08,570 --> 02:48:08,580
um AI system will design a nuclear
 

9047
02:48:08,580 --> 02:48:11,150
um AI system will design a nuclear
fusion reactor better than humans do but

9048
02:48:11,150 --> 02:48:11,160
fusion reactor better than humans do but
 

9049
02:48:11,160 --> 02:48:12,650
fusion reactor better than humans do but
we don't quite understand how it works

9050
02:48:12,650 --> 02:48:12,660
we don't quite understand how it works
 

9051
02:48:12,660 --> 02:48:15,590
we don't quite understand how it works
and they AI can't we know that it works

9052
02:48:15,590 --> 02:48:15,600
and they AI can't we know that it works
 

9053
02:48:15,600 --> 02:48:17,809
and they AI can't we know that it works
we can test it very thoroughly but we

9054
02:48:17,809 --> 02:48:17,819
we can test it very thoroughly but we
 

9055
02:48:17,819 --> 02:48:20,450
we can test it very thoroughly but we
don't know exactly what the control

9056
02:48:20,450 --> 02:48:20,460
don't know exactly what the control
 

9057
02:48:20,460 --> 02:48:22,190
don't know exactly what the control
mechanism is maybe what the chemistry

9058
02:48:22,190 --> 02:48:22,200
mechanism is maybe what the chemistry
 

9059
02:48:22,200 --> 02:48:24,770
mechanism is maybe what the chemistry
the physics is uh AI can't quite explain

9060
02:48:24,770 --> 02:48:24,780
the physics is uh AI can't quite explain
 

9061
02:48:24,780 --> 02:48:26,210
the physics is uh AI can't quite explain
it they just can't it's it's

9062
02:48:26,210 --> 02:48:26,220
it they just can't it's it's
 

9063
02:48:26,220 --> 02:48:28,130
it they just can't it's it's
impenetrable to our Consciousness

9064
02:48:28,130 --> 02:48:28,140
impenetrable to our Consciousness
 

9065
02:48:28,140 --> 02:48:29,990
impenetrable to our Consciousness
basically trying to hold it all together

9066
02:48:29,990 --> 02:48:30,000
basically trying to hold it all together
 

9067
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:31,730
basically trying to hold it all together
and then and then okay so now we're

9068
02:48:31,730 --> 02:48:31,740
and then and then okay so now we're
 

9069
02:48:31,740 --> 02:48:33,950
and then and then okay so now we're
living in that world where many of the

9070
02:48:33,950 --> 02:48:33,960
living in that world where many of the
 

9071
02:48:33,960 --> 02:48:35,809
living in that world where many of the
biggest discoveries are made by AI

9072
02:48:35,809 --> 02:48:35,819
biggest discoveries are made by AI
 

9073
02:48:35,819 --> 02:48:37,849
biggest discoveries are made by AI
systems yeah

9074
02:48:37,849 --> 02:48:37,859
systems yeah
 

9075
02:48:37,859 --> 02:48:41,389
systems yeah
uh as if we weren't going big yeah I I

9076
02:48:41,389 --> 02:48:41,399
uh as if we weren't going big yeah I I
 

9077
02:48:41,399 --> 02:48:43,250
uh as if we weren't going big yeah I I
say you know it's again another point

9078
02:48:43,250 --> 02:48:43,260
say you know it's again another point
 

9079
02:48:43,260 --> 02:48:45,290
say you know it's again another point
out like when my when when my godmother

9080
02:48:45,290 --> 02:48:45,300
out like when my when when my godmother
 

9081
02:48:45,300 --> 02:48:47,389
out like when my when when my godmother
was born like none of this was in front

9082
02:48:47,389 --> 02:48:47,399
was born like none of this was in front
 

9083
02:48:47,399 --> 02:48:49,309
was born like none of this was in front
of us right it's like we live in an

9084
02:48:49,309 --> 02:48:49,319
of us right it's like we live in an
 

9085
02:48:49,319 --> 02:48:52,010
of us right it's like we live in an
amazing time it's like right like my

9086
02:48:52,010 --> 02:48:52,020
amazing time it's like right like my
 

9087
02:48:52,020 --> 02:48:53,990
amazing time it's like right like my
grandfather you know plowed you know

9088
02:48:53,990 --> 02:48:54,000
grandfather you know plowed you know
 

9089
02:48:54,000 --> 02:48:55,969
grandfather you know plowed you know
feels with a horse

9090
02:48:55,969 --> 02:48:55,979
feels with a horse
 

9091
02:48:55,979 --> 02:48:57,530
feels with a horse
I get to work on designing Fusion

9092
02:48:57,530 --> 02:48:57,540
I get to work on designing Fusion
 

9093
02:48:57,540 --> 02:48:59,570
I get to work on designing Fusion
reactors yeah yeah

9094
02:48:59,570 --> 02:48:59,580
reactors yeah yeah
 

9095
02:48:59,580 --> 02:49:01,790
reactors yeah yeah
pretty amazing time but still there's

9096
02:49:01,790 --> 02:49:01,800
pretty amazing time but still there's
 

9097
02:49:01,800 --> 02:49:03,530
pretty amazing time but still there's
humans so we'll see we'll see we'll see

9098
02:49:03,530 --> 02:49:03,540
humans so we'll see we'll see we'll see
 

9099
02:49:03,540 --> 02:49:05,690
humans so we'll see we'll see we'll see
if that's around 100 years maybe it'll

9100
02:49:05,690 --> 02:49:05,700
if that's around 100 years maybe it'll
 

9101
02:49:05,700 --> 02:49:08,450
if that's around 100 years maybe it'll
be yeah I think we're pretty resilient

9102
02:49:08,450 --> 02:49:08,460
be yeah I think we're pretty resilient
 

9103
02:49:08,460 --> 02:49:11,330
be yeah I think we're pretty resilient
actually yeah no that's that's one

9104
02:49:11,330 --> 02:49:11,340
actually yeah no that's that's one
 

9105
02:49:11,340 --> 02:49:13,969
actually yeah no that's that's one
lesson from life is it uh finds a way

9106
02:49:13,969 --> 02:49:13,979
lesson from life is it uh finds a way
 

9107
02:49:13,979 --> 02:49:15,950
lesson from life is it uh finds a way
yeah let me ask you in a bigger question

9108
02:49:15,950 --> 02:49:15,960
yeah let me ask you in a bigger question
 

9109
02:49:15,960 --> 02:49:18,290
yeah let me ask you in a bigger question
if is it as if those weren't big enough

9110
02:49:18,290 --> 02:49:18,300
if is it as if those weren't big enough
 

9111
02:49:18,300 --> 02:49:20,389
if is it as if those weren't big enough
let's look out

9112
02:49:20,389 --> 02:49:20,399
let's look out
 

9113
02:49:20,399 --> 02:49:22,610
let's look out
maybe a few hundred years maybe a few

9114
02:49:22,610 --> 02:49:22,620
maybe a few hundred years maybe a few
 

9115
02:49:22,620 --> 02:49:23,929
maybe a few hundred years maybe a few
thousand years out

9116
02:49:23,929 --> 02:49:23,939
thousand years out
 

9117
02:49:23,939 --> 02:49:25,670
thousand years out
there's something called the kardashev

9118
02:49:25,670 --> 02:49:25,680
there's something called the kardashev
 

9119
02:49:25,680 --> 02:49:27,290
there's something called the kardashev
scale it's a method of measuring

9120
02:49:27,290 --> 02:49:27,300
scale it's a method of measuring
 

9121
02:49:27,300 --> 02:49:29,030
scale it's a method of measuring
civilization's level of technological

9122
02:49:29,030 --> 02:49:29,040
civilization's level of technological
 

9123
02:49:29,040 --> 02:49:31,070
civilization's level of technological
advancement based on the amount of

9124
02:49:31,070 --> 02:49:31,080
advancement based on the amount of
 

9125
02:49:31,080 --> 02:49:33,170
advancement based on the amount of
energy it's able to use so type 1

9126
02:49:33,170 --> 02:49:33,180
energy it's able to use so type 1
 

9127
02:49:33,180 --> 02:49:36,050
energy it's able to use so type 1
civilization and this might be given all

9128
02:49:36,050 --> 02:49:36,060
civilization and this might be given all
 

9129
02:49:36,060 --> 02:49:38,990
civilization and this might be given all
your work is not no longer a scale that

9130
02:49:38,990 --> 02:49:39,000
your work is not no longer a scale that
 

9131
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:42,590
your work is not no longer a scale that
makes quite make sense but it very much

9132
02:49:42,590 --> 02:49:42,600
makes quite make sense but it very much
 

9133
02:49:42,600 --> 02:49:45,230
makes quite make sense but it very much
focuses on the source of fusion natural

9134
02:49:45,230 --> 02:49:45,240
focuses on the source of fusion natural
 

9135
02:49:45,240 --> 02:49:47,750
focuses on the source of fusion natural
source of fusion which is for us the Sun

9136
02:49:47,750 --> 02:49:47,760
source of fusion which is for us the Sun
 

9137
02:49:47,760 --> 02:49:50,030
source of fusion which is for us the Sun
and type 1 civilizations are able to

9138
02:49:50,030 --> 02:49:50,040
and type 1 civilizations are able to
 

9139
02:49:50,040 --> 02:49:51,290
and type 1 civilizations are able to
Leverage

9140
02:49:51,290 --> 02:49:51,300
Leverage
 

9141
02:49:51,300 --> 02:49:54,170
Leverage
uh sort of collect all the energy that

9142
02:49:54,170 --> 02:49:54,180
uh sort of collect all the energy that
 

9143
02:49:54,180 --> 02:49:57,530
uh sort of collect all the energy that
hits Earth and then type 2 civilizations

9144
02:49:57,530 --> 02:49:57,540
hits Earth and then type 2 civilizations
 

9145
02:49:57,540 --> 02:49:59,929
hits Earth and then type 2 civilizations
are the ones that are able to Leverage

9146
02:49:59,929 --> 02:49:59,939
are the ones that are able to Leverage
 

9147
02:49:59,939 --> 02:50:02,570
are the ones that are able to Leverage
the entirety of the energy that comes

9148
02:50:02,570 --> 02:50:02,580
the entirety of the energy that comes
 

9149
02:50:02,580 --> 02:50:05,410
the entirety of the energy that comes
from the Sun by maybe building something

9150
02:50:05,410 --> 02:50:05,420
from the Sun by maybe building something
 

9151
02:50:05,420 --> 02:50:09,050
from the Sun by maybe building something
yeah so when will we reach type 1 status

9152
02:50:09,050 --> 02:50:09,060
yeah so when will we reach type 1 status
 

9153
02:50:09,060 --> 02:50:12,410
yeah so when will we reach type 1 status
is get to the level which were I think

9154
02:50:12,410 --> 02:50:12,420
is get to the level which were I think
 

9155
02:50:12,420 --> 02:50:14,330
is get to the level which were I think
maybe a few orders of magnitude away

9156
02:50:14,330 --> 02:50:14,340
maybe a few orders of magnitude away
 

9157
02:50:14,340 --> 02:50:16,730
maybe a few orders of magnitude away
from currently and in general do you

9158
02:50:16,730 --> 02:50:16,740
from currently and in general do you
 

9159
02:50:16,740 --> 02:50:17,929
from currently and in general do you
think about this kind of stuff because

9160
02:50:17,929 --> 02:50:17,939
think about this kind of stuff because
 

9161
02:50:17,939 --> 02:50:20,690
think about this kind of stuff because
where energy is so fundamental to this

9162
02:50:20,690 --> 02:50:20,700
where energy is so fundamental to this
 

9163
02:50:20,700 --> 02:50:23,750
where energy is so fundamental to this
like of life on Earth but also the

9164
02:50:23,750 --> 02:50:23,760
like of life on Earth but also the
 

9165
02:50:23,760 --> 02:50:26,270
like of life on Earth but also the
expansion of life into the universe oh

9166
02:50:26,270 --> 02:50:26,280
expansion of life into the universe oh
 

9167
02:50:26,280 --> 02:50:29,750
expansion of life into the universe oh
yeah so what one of the fun you know on

9168
02:50:29,750 --> 02:50:29,760
yeah so what one of the fun you know on
 

9169
02:50:29,760 --> 02:50:32,090
yeah so what one of the fun you know on
the on a weekend one I I sat down and

9170
02:50:32,090 --> 02:50:32,100
the on a weekend one I I sat down and
 

9171
02:50:32,100 --> 02:50:33,469
the on a weekend one I I sat down and
figured out what would it mean for

9172
02:50:33,469 --> 02:50:33,479
figured out what would it mean for
 

9173
02:50:33,479 --> 02:50:36,590
figured out what would it mean for
Interstellar travel like to have a DT

9174
02:50:36,590 --> 02:50:36,600
Interstellar travel like to have a DT
 

9175
02:50:36,600 --> 02:50:39,050
Interstellar travel like to have a DT
Fusion in fact one of the I talked about

9176
02:50:39,050 --> 02:50:39,060
Fusion in fact one of the I talked about
 

9177
02:50:39,060 --> 02:50:41,090
Fusion in fact one of the I talked about
my design class one of my design classes

9178
02:50:41,090 --> 02:50:41,100
my design class one of my design classes
 

9179
02:50:41,100 --> 02:50:43,490
my design class one of my design classes
was how you use

9180
02:50:43,490 --> 02:50:43,500
was how you use
 

9181
02:50:43,500 --> 02:50:45,950
was how you use
um essentially a special configuration

9182
02:50:45,950 --> 02:50:45,960
um essentially a special configuration
 

9183
02:50:45,960 --> 02:50:48,110
um essentially a special configuration
of a fusion device for not only

9184
02:50:48,110 --> 02:50:48,120
of a fusion device for not only
 

9185
02:50:48,120 --> 02:50:50,990
of a fusion device for not only
traveling to but colonizing Mars so

9186
02:50:50,990 --> 02:50:51,000
traveling to but colonizing Mars so
 

9187
02:50:51,000 --> 02:50:53,630
traveling to but colonizing Mars so
because what would you talk about energy

9188
02:50:53,630 --> 02:50:53,640
because what would you talk about energy
 

9189
02:50:53,640 --> 02:50:55,969
because what would you talk about energy
use being at the heart of civilizations

9190
02:50:55,969 --> 02:50:55,979
use being at the heart of civilizations
 

9191
02:50:55,979 --> 02:50:57,889
use being at the heart of civilizations
like so what if you want to go to Mars

9192
02:50:57,889 --> 02:50:57,899
like so what if you want to go to Mars
 

9193
02:50:57,899 --> 02:50:59,809
like so what if you want to go to Mars
not to just visit it but actually like

9194
02:50:59,809 --> 02:50:59,819
not to just visit it but actually like
 

9195
02:50:59,819 --> 02:51:01,790
not to just visit it but actually like
leave people there and make it something

9196
02:51:01,790 --> 02:51:01,800
leave people there and make it something
 

9197
02:51:01,800 --> 02:51:03,950
leave people there and make it something
happen and these massive amounts of

9198
02:51:03,950 --> 02:51:03,960
happen and these massive amounts of
 

9199
02:51:03,960 --> 02:51:05,990
happen and these massive amounts of
energy so what would that look like and

9200
02:51:05,990 --> 02:51:06,000
energy so what would that look like and
 

9201
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:07,969
energy so what would that look like and
it actually transforms what how you're

9202
02:51:07,969 --> 02:51:07,979
it actually transforms what how you're
 

9203
02:51:07,979 --> 02:51:10,190
it actually transforms what how you're
thinking about doing that as well too oh

9204
02:51:10,190 --> 02:51:10,200
thinking about doing that as well too oh
 

9205
02:51:10,200 --> 02:51:11,750
thinking about doing that as well too oh
yeah so we we do all those kinds of fun

9206
02:51:11,750 --> 02:51:11,760
yeah so we we do all those kinds of fun
 

9207
02:51:11,760 --> 02:51:13,630
yeah so we we do all those kinds of fun
and actually it was a fairly you know

9208
02:51:13,630 --> 02:51:13,640
and actually it was a fairly you know
 

9209
02:51:13,640 --> 02:51:16,309
and actually it was a fairly you know
quasi-realistic actually so do you think

9210
02:51:16,309 --> 02:51:16,319
quasi-realistic actually so do you think
 

9211
02:51:16,319 --> 02:51:19,130
quasi-realistic actually so do you think
it'll be nuclear fusion that powers the

9212
02:51:19,130 --> 02:51:19,140
it'll be nuclear fusion that powers the
 

9213
02:51:19,140 --> 02:51:21,230
it'll be nuclear fusion that powers the
civilization on Mars well what we

9214
02:51:21,230 --> 02:51:21,240
civilization on Mars well what we
 

9215
02:51:21,240 --> 02:51:23,090
civilization on Mars well what we
considered was something so it turns out

9216
02:51:23,090 --> 02:51:23,100
considered was something so it turns out
 

9217
02:51:23,100 --> 02:51:24,950
considered was something so it turns out
that there's thorium

9218
02:51:24,950 --> 02:51:24,960
that there's thorium
 

9219
02:51:24,960 --> 02:51:27,290
that there's thorium
which is a heavy element so it's a

9220
02:51:27,290 --> 02:51:27,300
which is a heavy element so it's a
 

9221
02:51:27,300 --> 02:51:29,630
which is a heavy element so it's a
so-called fertile element that we know

9222
02:51:29,630 --> 02:51:29,640
so-called fertile element that we know
 

9223
02:51:29,640 --> 02:51:32,450
so-called fertile element that we know
what we still know fairly little about

9224
02:51:32,450 --> 02:51:32,460
what we still know fairly little about
 

9225
02:51:32,460 --> 02:51:35,809
what we still know fairly little about
the the geology of Mars and in the Deep

9226
02:51:35,809 --> 02:51:35,819
the the geology of Mars and in the Deep
 

9227
02:51:35,819 --> 02:51:37,790
the the geology of Mars and in the Deep
sense and we know that there's a lot of

9228
02:51:37,790 --> 02:51:37,800
sense and we know that there's a lot of
 

9229
02:51:37,800 --> 02:51:39,650
sense and we know that there's a lot of
this on the surface of Mars so one of

9230
02:51:39,650 --> 02:51:39,660
this on the surface of Mars so one of
 

9231
02:51:39,660 --> 02:51:40,969
this on the surface of Mars so one of
the things we considered was what would

9232
02:51:40,969 --> 02:51:40,979
the things we considered was what would
 

9233
02:51:40,979 --> 02:51:43,309
the things we considered was what would
happen that it's basically a combination

9234
02:51:43,309 --> 02:51:43,319
happen that it's basically a combination
 

9235
02:51:43,319 --> 02:51:46,550
happen that it's basically a combination
of a fusion device that actually makes

9236
02:51:46,550 --> 02:51:46,560
of a fusion device that actually makes
 

9237
02:51:46,560 --> 02:51:48,710
of a fusion device that actually makes
fuel from the thorium

9238
02:51:48,710 --> 02:51:48,720
fuel from the thorium
 

9239
02:51:48,720 --> 02:51:50,690
fuel from the thorium
oh but the under but the underlying

9240
02:51:50,690 --> 02:51:50,700
oh but the under but the underlying
 

9241
02:51:50,700 --> 02:51:53,690
oh but the under but the underlying
energy one was was Fusion itself as well

9242
02:51:53,690 --> 02:51:53,700
energy one was was Fusion itself as well
 

9243
02:51:53,700 --> 02:51:55,790
energy one was was Fusion itself as well
too so this is one of the examples of

9244
02:51:55,790 --> 02:51:55,800
too so this is one of the examples of
 

9245
02:51:55,800 --> 02:51:57,710
too so this is one of the examples of
being trying to be clever right around

9246
02:51:57,710 --> 02:51:57,720
being trying to be clever right around
 

9247
02:51:57,720 --> 02:51:59,690
being trying to be clever right around
those things or what is it you know this

9248
02:51:59,690 --> 02:51:59,700
those things or what is it you know this
 

9249
02:51:59,700 --> 02:52:01,250
those things or what is it you know this
also means it's like an Interstellar

9250
02:52:01,250 --> 02:52:01,260
also means it's like an Interstellar
 

9251
02:52:01,260 --> 02:52:02,809
also means it's like an Interstellar
travel it's like oh yeah that looks

9252
02:52:02,809 --> 02:52:02,819
travel it's like oh yeah that looks
 

9253
02:52:02,819 --> 02:52:05,030
travel it's like oh yeah that looks
almost like impossible basically from an

9254
02:52:05,030 --> 02:52:05,040
almost like impossible basically from an
 

9255
02:52:05,040 --> 02:52:06,530
almost like impossible basically from an
energy balance point of view it's just

9256
02:52:06,530 --> 02:52:06,540
energy balance point of view it's just
 

9257
02:52:06,540 --> 02:52:08,990
energy balance point of view it's just
because like the energy required to that

9258
02:52:08,990 --> 02:52:09,000
because like the energy required to that
 

9259
02:52:09,000 --> 02:52:10,370
because like the energy required to that
you have to transport to get there

9260
02:52:10,370 --> 02:52:10,380
you have to transport to get there
 

9261
02:52:10,380 --> 02:52:12,469
you have to transport to get there
almost the only things that would work

9262
02:52:12,469 --> 02:52:12,479
almost the only things that would work
 

9263
02:52:12,479 --> 02:52:15,530
almost the only things that would work
are DT fusion and basically um

9264
02:52:15,530 --> 02:52:15,540
are DT fusion and basically um
 

9265
02:52:15,540 --> 02:52:18,110
are DT fusion and basically um
Annihilation It's like Star Trek right

9266
02:52:18,110 --> 02:52:18,120
Annihilation It's like Star Trek right
 

9267
02:52:18,120 --> 02:52:19,630
Annihilation It's like Star Trek right
absolutely

9268
02:52:19,630 --> 02:52:19,640
absolutely
 

9269
02:52:19,640 --> 02:52:22,309
absolutely
your sense is that Interstellar travel

9270
02:52:22,309 --> 02:52:22,319
your sense is that Interstellar travel
 

9271
02:52:22,319 --> 02:52:25,309
your sense is that Interstellar travel
will require fusion power oh it's it's

9272
02:52:25,309 --> 02:52:25,319
will require fusion power oh it's it's
 

9273
02:52:25,319 --> 02:52:27,410
will require fusion power oh it's it's
almost even impossible with fusion power

9274
02:52:27,410 --> 02:52:27,420
almost even impossible with fusion power
 

9275
02:52:27,420 --> 02:52:29,210
almost even impossible with fusion power
actually it's so hard

9276
02:52:29,210 --> 02:52:29,220
actually it's so hard
 

9277
02:52:29,220 --> 02:52:31,790
actually it's so hard
it's so hard because you have to carry

9278
02:52:31,790 --> 02:52:31,800
it's so hard because you have to carry
 

9279
02:52:31,800 --> 02:52:34,250
it's so hard because you have to carry
the fuel with you and the rocket

9280
02:52:34,250 --> 02:52:34,260
the fuel with you and the rocket
 

9281
02:52:34,260 --> 02:52:35,990
the fuel with you and the rocket
equation tells you about how much fuel

9282
02:52:35,990 --> 02:52:36,000
equation tells you about how much fuel
 

9283
02:52:36,000 --> 02:52:39,110
equation tells you about how much fuel
you use to take so what you end up with

9284
02:52:39,110 --> 02:52:39,120
you use to take so what you end up with
 

9285
02:52:39,120 --> 02:52:40,849
you use to take so what you end up with
is like how long does it take to go to

9286
02:52:40,849 --> 02:52:40,859
is like how long does it take to go to
 

9287
02:52:40,859 --> 02:52:43,130
is like how long does it take to go to
these places and it's like staggering

9288
02:52:43,130 --> 02:52:43,140
these places and it's like staggering
 

9289
02:52:43,140 --> 02:52:46,010
these places and it's like staggering
you know periods of time so I I tend to

9290
02:52:46,010 --> 02:52:46,020
you know periods of time so I I tend to
 

9291
02:52:46,020 --> 02:52:47,330
you know periods of time so I I tend to
believe that there is alien

9292
02:52:47,330 --> 02:52:47,340
believe that there is alien
 

9293
02:52:47,340 --> 02:52:49,969
believe that there is alien
civilizations dispersed all throughout

9294
02:52:49,969 --> 02:52:49,979
civilizations dispersed all throughout
 

9295
02:52:49,979 --> 02:52:52,130
civilizations dispersed all throughout
yeah but we might have totally isolated

9296
02:52:52,130 --> 02:52:52,140
yeah but we might have totally isolated
 

9297
02:52:52,140 --> 02:52:53,809
yeah but we might have totally isolated
from them so you think we're not there's

9298
02:52:53,809 --> 02:52:53,819
from them so you think we're not there's
 

9299
02:52:53,819 --> 02:52:55,969
from them so you think we're not there's
none in this galaxy

9300
02:52:55,969 --> 02:52:55,979
none in this galaxy
 

9301
02:52:55,979 --> 02:52:58,429
none in this galaxy
so like and I guess and the question I

9302
02:52:58,429 --> 02:52:58,439
so like and I guess and the question I
 

9303
02:52:58,439 --> 02:53:00,110
so like and I guess and the question I
also have is what kind of do you think

9304
02:53:00,110 --> 02:53:00,120
also have is what kind of do you think
 

9305
02:53:00,120 --> 02:53:02,570
also have is what kind of do you think
they have nuclear fusion I was like is

9306
02:53:02,570 --> 02:53:02,580
they have nuclear fusion I was like is
 

9307
02:53:02,580 --> 02:53:04,309
they have nuclear fusion I was like is
it all yes the physics all the same yeah

9308
02:53:04,309 --> 02:53:04,319
it all yes the physics all the same yeah
 

9309
02:53:04,319 --> 02:53:05,870
it all yes the physics all the same yeah
oh the physics is all the same yeah

9310
02:53:05,870 --> 02:53:05,880
oh the physics is all the same yeah
 

9311
02:53:05,880 --> 02:53:07,429
oh the physics is all the same yeah
right so this is the and this is the

9312
02:53:07,429 --> 02:53:07,439
right so this is the and this is the
 

9313
02:53:07,439 --> 02:53:09,410
right so this is the and this is the
Fermi Paradox like where where the hell

9314
02:53:09,410 --> 02:53:09,420
Fermi Paradox like where where the hell
 

9315
02:53:09,420 --> 02:53:12,349
Fermi Paradox like where where the hell
is everybody in the universe right

9316
02:53:12,349 --> 02:53:12,359
is everybody in the universe right
 

9317
02:53:12,359 --> 02:53:13,670
is everybody in the universe right
um well there's some so you know the

9318
02:53:13,670 --> 02:53:13,680
um well there's some so you know the
 

9319
02:53:13,680 --> 02:53:16,910
um well there's some so you know the
scariest one of those is that I would

9320
02:53:16,910 --> 02:53:16,920
scariest one of those is that I would
 

9321
02:53:16,920 --> 02:53:18,410
scariest one of those is that I would
point out that there's been you know

9322
02:53:18,410 --> 02:53:18,420
point out that there's been you know
 

9323
02:53:18,420 --> 02:53:21,050
point out that there's been you know
there's you know order of many tens of

9324
02:53:21,050 --> 02:53:21,060
there's you know order of many tens of
 

9325
02:53:21,060 --> 02:53:23,330
there's you know order of many tens of
millions of species on the planet Earth

9326
02:53:23,330 --> 02:53:23,340
millions of species on the planet Earth
 

9327
02:53:23,340 --> 02:53:26,150
millions of species on the planet Earth
and only one ever got to the point of

9328
02:53:26,150 --> 02:53:26,160
and only one ever got to the point of
 

9329
02:53:26,160 --> 02:53:28,610
and only one ever got to the point of
sophisticated tool use that we could

9330
02:53:28,610 --> 02:53:28,620
sophisticated tool use that we could
 

9331
02:53:28,620 --> 02:53:30,590
sophisticated tool use that we could
actually start essentially leveraging

9332
02:53:30,590 --> 02:53:30,600
actually start essentially leveraging
 

9333
02:53:30,600 --> 02:53:34,250
actually start essentially leveraging
the power of what what's in nature to

9334
02:53:34,250 --> 02:53:34,260
the power of what what's in nature to
 

9335
02:53:34,260 --> 02:53:36,530
the power of what what's in nature to
our own will does this mean that

9336
02:53:36,530 --> 02:53:36,540
our own will does this mean that
 

9337
02:53:36,540 --> 02:53:38,389
our own will does this mean that
basically this means so almost look

9338
02:53:38,389 --> 02:53:38,399
basically this means so almost look
 

9339
02:53:38,399 --> 02:53:41,510
basically this means so almost look
there is almost certainly life or DNA

9340
02:53:41,510 --> 02:53:41,520
there is almost certainly life or DNA
 

9341
02:53:41,520 --> 02:53:42,830
there is almost certainly life or DNA
equivalence or whatever would be

9342
02:53:42,830 --> 02:53:42,840
equivalence or whatever would be
 

9343
02:53:42,840 --> 02:53:44,450
equivalence or whatever would be
somewhere I mean just because you just

9344
02:53:44,450 --> 02:53:44,460
somewhere I mean just because you just
 

9345
02:53:44,460 --> 02:53:46,610
somewhere I mean just because you just
need to soup and you need energy and you

9346
02:53:46,610 --> 02:53:46,620
need to soup and you need energy and you
 

9347
02:53:46,620 --> 02:53:49,190
need to soup and you need energy and you
get Organics and whatever the equivalent

9348
02:53:49,190 --> 02:53:49,200
get Organics and whatever the equivalent
 

9349
02:53:49,200 --> 02:53:51,950
get Organics and whatever the equivalent
of amino acids are but you know most of

9350
02:53:51,950 --> 02:53:51,960
of amino acids are but you know most of
 

9351
02:53:51,960 --> 02:53:53,870
of amino acids are but you know most of
life on Earth has been that those are

9352
02:53:53,870 --> 02:53:53,880
life on Earth has been that those are
 

9353
02:53:53,880 --> 02:53:56,030
life on Earth has been that those are
still amazing but it's still it's not

9354
02:53:56,030 --> 02:53:56,040
still amazing but it's still it's not
 

9355
02:53:56,040 --> 02:53:58,490
still amazing but it's still it's not
very interesting are we are we actually

9356
02:53:58,490 --> 02:53:58,500
very interesting are we are we actually
 

9357
02:53:58,500 --> 02:54:00,469
very interesting are we are we actually
the accident of History this is a very

9358
02:54:00,469 --> 02:54:00,479
the accident of History this is a very
 

9359
02:54:00,479 --> 02:54:03,530
the accident of History this is a very
interesting one they're super rare super

9360
02:54:03,530 --> 02:54:03,540
interesting one they're super rare super
 

9361
02:54:03,540 --> 02:54:05,389
interesting one they're super rare super
rare and then of course the other part

9362
02:54:05,389 --> 02:54:05,399
rare and then of course the other part
 

9363
02:54:05,399 --> 02:54:08,750
rare and then of course the other part
is that also just the other scary part

9364
02:54:08,750 --> 02:54:08,760
is that also just the other scary part
 

9365
02:54:08,760 --> 02:54:10,250
is that also just the other scary part
of it which is if you look at the fairy

9366
02:54:10,250 --> 02:54:10,260
of it which is if you look at the fairy
 

9367
02:54:10,260 --> 02:54:13,070
of it which is if you look at the fairy
paradoxes good good we got to this point

9368
02:54:13,070 --> 02:54:13,080
paradoxes good good we got to this point
 

9369
02:54:13,080 --> 02:54:16,849
paradoxes good good we got to this point
how long has it been in humans so humans

9370
02:54:16,849 --> 02:54:16,859
how long has it been in humans so humans
 

9371
02:54:16,859 --> 02:54:18,530
how long has it been in humans so humans
Homo Sapien has been around for whatever

9372
02:54:18,530 --> 02:54:18,540
Homo Sapien has been around for whatever
 

9373
02:54:18,540 --> 02:54:21,650
Homo Sapien has been around for whatever
100 000 years 200 000 years

9374
02:54:21,650 --> 02:54:21,660
100 000 years 200 000 years
 

9375
02:54:21,660 --> 02:54:24,230
100 000 years 200 000 years
um our ability in in that timeline to

9376
02:54:24,230 --> 02:54:24,240
um our ability in in that timeline to
 

9377
02:54:24,240 --> 02:54:26,450
um our ability in in that timeline to
actually make an imprint on the universe

9378
02:54:26,450 --> 02:54:26,460
actually make an imprint on the universe
 

9379
02:54:26,460 --> 02:54:29,030
actually make an imprint on the universe
like for by emitting radio waves or by

9380
02:54:29,030 --> 02:54:29,040
like for by emitting radio waves or by
 

9381
02:54:29,040 --> 02:54:30,830
like for by emitting radio waves or by
modifying you know in nature in a

9382
02:54:30,830 --> 02:54:30,840
modifying you know in nature in a
 

9383
02:54:30,840 --> 02:54:33,170
modifying you know in nature in a
significant way has only been for about

9384
02:54:33,170 --> 02:54:33,180
significant way has only been for about
 

9385
02:54:33,180 --> 02:54:34,790
significant way has only been for about
a hundred of those hundred thousand

9386
02:54:34,790 --> 02:54:34,800
a hundred of those hundred thousand
 

9387
02:54:34,800 --> 02:54:35,750
a hundred of those hundred thousand
years

9388
02:54:35,750 --> 02:54:35,760
years
 

9389
02:54:35,760 --> 02:54:38,210
years
and you know are we it's a good question

9390
02:54:38,210 --> 02:54:38,220
and you know are we it's a good question
 

9391
02:54:38,220 --> 02:54:41,389
and you know are we it's a good question
so is it by definition that by the fact

9392
02:54:41,389 --> 02:54:41,399
so is it by definition that by the fact
 

9393
02:54:41,399 --> 02:54:43,010
so is it by definition that by the fact
that when you are able to reach that

9394
02:54:43,010 --> 02:54:43,020
that when you are able to reach that
 

9395
02:54:43,020 --> 02:54:46,010
that when you are able to reach that
level of being able to manipulate nature

9396
02:54:46,010 --> 02:54:46,020
level of being able to manipulate nature
 

9397
02:54:46,020 --> 02:54:49,429
level of being able to manipulate nature
and for example discover you know

9398
02:54:49,429 --> 02:54:49,439
and for example discover you know
 

9399
02:54:49,439 --> 02:54:53,030
and for example discover you know
discover like fission or or or other or

9400
02:54:53,030 --> 02:54:53,040
discover like fission or or or other or
 

9401
02:54:53,040 --> 02:54:56,030
discover like fission or or or other or
or burning fossil fuels and all this is

9402
02:54:56,030 --> 02:54:56,040
or burning fossil fuels and all this is
 

9403
02:54:56,040 --> 02:54:57,769
or burning fossil fuels and all this is
that what it says oh you're doomed

9404
02:54:57,769 --> 02:54:57,779
that what it says oh you're doomed
 

9405
02:54:57,779 --> 02:55:00,769
that what it says oh you're doomed
because by definition any species that

9406
02:55:00,769 --> 02:55:00,779
because by definition any species that
 

9407
02:55:00,779 --> 02:55:02,389
because by definition any species that
gets to that point that can modify their

9408
02:55:02,389 --> 02:55:02,399
gets to that point that can modify their
 

9409
02:55:02,399 --> 02:55:04,250
gets to that point that can modify their
environment like that they'll actually

9410
02:55:04,250 --> 02:55:04,260
environment like that they'll actually
 

9411
02:55:04,260 --> 02:55:05,929
environment like that they'll actually
push themselves

9412
02:55:05,929 --> 02:55:05,939
push themselves
 

9413
02:55:05,939 --> 02:55:07,490
push themselves
you know past that's that's one of the

9414
02:55:07,490 --> 02:55:07,500
you know past that's that's one of the
 

9415
02:55:07,500 --> 02:55:08,990
you know past that's that's one of the
most depressing scenarios that I can

9416
02:55:08,990 --> 02:55:09,000
most depressing scenarios that I can
 

9417
02:55:09,000 --> 02:55:10,849
most depressing scenarios that I can
imagine yeah so the the so basically

9418
02:55:10,849 --> 02:55:10,859
imagine yeah so the the so basically
 

9419
02:55:10,859 --> 02:55:13,370
imagine yeah so the the so basically
we're we will never line up in time

9420
02:55:13,370 --> 02:55:13,380
we're we will never line up in time
 

9421
02:55:13,380 --> 02:55:15,170
we're we will never line up in time
because you get this little teeny window

9422
02:55:15,170 --> 02:55:15,180
because you get this little teeny window
 

9423
02:55:15,180 --> 02:55:17,690
because you get this little teeny window
in time over civilization might occur

9424
02:55:17,690 --> 02:55:17,700
in time over civilization might occur
 

9425
02:55:17,700 --> 02:55:19,790
in time over civilization might occur
and you you can never see it because you

9426
02:55:19,790 --> 02:55:19,800
and you you can never see it because you
 

9427
02:55:19,800 --> 02:55:22,309
and you you can never see it because you
never these these sort of like scatter

9428
02:55:22,309 --> 02:55:22,319
never these these sort of like scatter
 

9429
02:55:22,319 --> 02:55:24,590
never these these sort of like scatter
like like fireflies around the Galaxy

9430
02:55:24,590 --> 02:55:24,600
like like fireflies around the Galaxy
 

9431
02:55:24,600 --> 02:55:26,290
like like fireflies around the Galaxy
and you never yeah yeah

9432
02:55:26,290 --> 02:55:26,300
and you never yeah yeah
 

9433
02:55:26,300 --> 02:55:28,849
and you never yeah yeah
and then explodes it destroys itself

9434
02:55:28,849 --> 02:55:28,859
and then explodes it destroys itself
 

9435
02:55:28,859 --> 02:55:30,889
and then explodes it destroys itself
because of the potential and when we say

9436
02:55:30,889 --> 02:55:30,899
because of the potential and when we say
 

9437
02:55:30,899 --> 02:55:32,630
because of the potential and when we say
destroy ourselves all we would have to

9438
02:55:32,630 --> 02:55:32,640
destroy ourselves all we would have to
 

9439
02:55:32,640 --> 02:55:35,690
destroy ourselves all we would have to
do is that we basically go if you humans

9440
02:55:35,690 --> 02:55:35,700
do is that we basically go if you humans
 

9441
02:55:35,700 --> 02:55:37,130
do is that we basically go if you humans
are all left and we're still living on

9442
02:55:37,130 --> 02:55:37,140
are all left and we're still living on
 

9443
02:55:37,140 --> 02:55:39,230
are all left and we're still living on
the planet and but all we have to do is

9444
02:55:39,230 --> 02:55:39,240
the planet and but all we have to do is
 

9445
02:55:39,240 --> 02:55:41,990
the planet and but all we have to do is
go to the technology of like you know

9446
02:55:41,990 --> 02:55:42,000
go to the technology of like you know
 

9447
02:55:42,000 --> 02:55:44,570
go to the technology of like you know
1800 yeah and we're invisible in the

9448
02:55:44,570 --> 02:55:44,580
1800 yeah and we're invisible in the
 

9449
02:55:44,580 --> 02:55:46,190
1800 yeah and we're invisible in the
universe again

9450
02:55:46,190 --> 02:55:46,200
universe again
 

9451
02:55:46,200 --> 02:55:48,590
universe again
yeah he so it was when I when I listened

9452
02:55:48,590 --> 02:55:48,600
yeah he so it was when I when I listened
 

9453
02:55:48,600 --> 02:55:50,269
yeah he so it was when I when I listened
to the part I I thought I wanted to talk

9454
02:55:50,269 --> 02:55:50,279
to the part I I thought I wanted to talk
 

9455
02:55:50,279 --> 02:55:51,950
to the part I I thought I wanted to talk
about this as well too because this it

9456
02:55:51,950 --> 02:55:51,960
about this as well too because this it
 

9457
02:55:51,960 --> 02:55:53,150
about this as well too because this it
comes from well it comes from a science

9458
02:55:53,150 --> 02:55:53,160
comes from well it comes from a science
 

9459
02:55:53,160 --> 02:55:54,830
comes from well it comes from a science
point of view actually of what it means

9460
02:55:54,830 --> 02:55:54,840
point of view actually of what it means
 

9461
02:55:54,840 --> 02:55:56,630
point of view actually of what it means
but also to me it's like another

9462
02:55:56,630 --> 02:55:56,640
but also to me it's like another
 

9463
02:55:56,640 --> 02:55:58,550
but also to me it's like another
compelling driver of telling us it's

9464
02:55:58,550 --> 02:55:58,560
compelling driver of telling us it's
 

9465
02:55:58,560 --> 02:56:01,070
compelling driver of telling us it's
like why we should try really hard not

9466
02:56:01,070 --> 02:56:01,080
like why we should try really hard not
 

9467
02:56:01,080 --> 02:56:03,469
like why we should try really hard not
to screw this up like we're in this

9468
02:56:03,469 --> 02:56:03,479
to screw this up like we're in this
 

9469
02:56:03,479 --> 02:56:05,809
to screw this up like we're in this
unique place of our ability to discover

9470
02:56:05,809 --> 02:56:05,819
unique place of our ability to discover
 

9471
02:56:05,819 --> 02:56:08,809
unique place of our ability to discover
and make it and I just don't want to

9472
02:56:08,809 --> 02:56:08,819
and make it and I just don't want to
 

9473
02:56:08,819 --> 02:56:10,490
and make it and I just don't want to
give up about thinking that we can get

9474
02:56:10,490 --> 02:56:10,500
give up about thinking that we can get
 

9475
02:56:10,500 --> 02:56:13,130
give up about thinking that we can get
through yeah I tend to see that there is

9476
02:56:13,130 --> 02:56:13,140
through yeah I tend to see that there is
 

9477
02:56:13,140 --> 02:56:14,809
through yeah I tend to see that there is
some kind of game theoretic Force like

9478
02:56:14,809 --> 02:56:14,819
some kind of game theoretic Force like
 

9479
02:56:14,819 --> 02:56:17,030
some kind of game theoretic Force like
with Demetrius shared destruction that

9480
02:56:17,030 --> 02:56:17,040
with Demetrius shared destruction that
 

9481
02:56:17,040 --> 02:56:20,510
with Demetrius shared destruction that
ultimately in each human being there's a

9482
02:56:20,510 --> 02:56:20,520
ultimately in each human being there's a
 

9483
02:56:20,520 --> 02:56:23,929
ultimately in each human being there's a
desire to survive and a willingness to

9484
02:56:23,929 --> 02:56:23,939
desire to survive and a willingness to
 

9485
02:56:23,939 --> 02:56:26,330
desire to survive and a willingness to
cooperate to have compassion for each

9486
02:56:26,330 --> 02:56:26,340
cooperate to have compassion for each
 

9487
02:56:26,340 --> 02:56:28,429
cooperate to have compassion for each
other in order to survive and I think

9488
02:56:28,429 --> 02:56:28,439
other in order to survive and I think
 

9489
02:56:28,439 --> 02:56:32,450
other in order to survive and I think
that I mean maybe not in humans but I

9490
02:56:32,450 --> 02:56:32,460
that I mean maybe not in humans but I
 

9491
02:56:32,460 --> 02:56:34,610
that I mean maybe not in humans but I
can imagine nearly infinite number of

9492
02:56:34,610 --> 02:56:34,620
can imagine nearly infinite number of
 

9493
02:56:34,620 --> 02:56:36,110
can imagine nearly infinite number of
species in which

9494
02:56:36,110 --> 02:56:36,120
species in which
 

9495
02:56:36,120 --> 02:56:38,330
species in which
that overpowers

9496
02:56:38,330 --> 02:56:38,340
that overpowers
 

9497
02:56:38,340 --> 02:56:41,510
that overpowers
any uh technological advancement that

9498
02:56:41,510 --> 02:56:41,520
any uh technological advancement that
 

9499
02:56:41,520 --> 02:56:44,510
any uh technological advancement that
can destroy or rewind the species so I

9500
02:56:44,510 --> 02:56:44,520
can destroy or rewind the species so I
 

9501
02:56:44,520 --> 02:56:46,610
can destroy or rewind the species so I
think if humans fail

9502
02:56:46,610 --> 02:56:46,620
think if humans fail
 

9503
02:56:46,620 --> 02:56:48,170
think if humans fail
I hope they don't

9504
02:56:48,170 --> 02:56:48,180
I hope they don't
 

9505
02:56:48,180 --> 02:56:50,570
I hope they don't
I see a lot of evidence for them not but

9506
02:56:50,570 --> 02:56:50,580
I see a lot of evidence for them not but
 

9507
02:56:50,580 --> 02:56:52,670
I see a lot of evidence for them not but
it seems like somebody will survive and

9508
02:56:52,670 --> 02:56:52,680
it seems like somebody will survive and
 

9509
02:56:52,680 --> 02:56:54,230
it seems like somebody will survive and
there you start to ask questions about

9510
02:56:54,230 --> 02:56:54,240
there you start to ask questions about
 

9511
02:56:54,240 --> 02:56:56,870
there you start to ask questions about
why why we haven't met yet maybe it's

9512
02:56:56,870 --> 02:56:56,880
why why we haven't met yet maybe it's
 

9513
02:56:56,880 --> 02:57:01,130
why why we haven't met yet maybe it's
just space is large oh spaces it's I I

9514
02:57:01,130 --> 02:57:01,140
just space is large oh spaces it's I I
 

9515
02:57:01,140 --> 02:57:03,070
just space is large oh spaces it's I I
think in logarithms and I can't even

9516
02:57:03,070 --> 02:57:03,080
think in logarithms and I can't even
 

9517
02:57:03,080 --> 02:57:05,870
think in logarithms and I can't even
fathom you know space this is

9518
02:57:05,870 --> 02:57:05,880
fathom you know space this is
 

9519
02:57:05,880 --> 02:57:07,969

time yeah and there's so many other
places I haven't visited there's so many

9530
02:57:16,070 --> 02:57:16,080
places I haven't visited there's so many
 

9531

places I haven't visited there's so many
other places well I like to you know

other places well I like to you know
it's interesting that we have this

9534
02:57:19,849 --> 02:57:19,859
it's interesting that we have this
 

9535
02:57:19,859 --> 02:57:23,450
it's interesting that we have this
fascination with alien life we have what

9536
02:57:23,450 --> 02:57:23,460
fascination with alien life we have what
 

9537
02:57:23,460 --> 02:57:25,429
fascination with alien life we have what
is essentially alien life on Earth

9538
02:57:25,429 --> 02:57:25,439
is essentially alien life on Earth
 

9539
02:57:25,439 --> 02:57:27,170
is essentially alien life on Earth
already like you think about the

9540
02:57:27,170 --> 02:57:27,180
already like you think about the
 

9541
02:57:27,180 --> 02:57:29,990
already like you think about the
organisms that develop around deep sea

9542
02:57:29,990 --> 02:57:30,000
organisms that develop around deep sea
 

9543
02:57:30,000 --> 02:57:31,849
organisms that develop around deep sea
like thermal vents one of my favorite

9544

of blows your mind it's about the
 

9551
02:57:38,460 --> 02:57:41,030
of blows your mind it's about the
Cambrian explosion of life and it's like

9552
02:57:41,030 --> 02:57:41,040
Cambrian explosion of life and it's like
 

9553
02:57:41,040 --> 02:57:43,010
Cambrian explosion of life and it's like
oh you look at these things and it's

9554
02:57:43,010 --> 02:57:43,020
oh you look at these things and it's
 

9555
02:57:43,020 --> 02:57:46,070
oh you look at these things and it's
like our the chance of us existing as a

9556
02:57:46,070 --> 02:57:46,080
like our the chance of us existing as a
 

9557
02:57:46,080 --> 02:57:48,110
like our the chance of us existing as a
species like the the genetic diverse

9558
02:57:48,110 --> 02:57:48,120
species like the the genetic diverse
 

9559
02:57:48,120 --> 02:57:50,690
species like the the genetic diverse
city was larger back then you know this

9560
02:57:50,690 --> 02:57:50,700
city was larger back then you know this
 

9561
02:57:50,700 --> 02:57:52,429
city was larger back then you know this
is about five about 500 million years

9562
02:57:52,429 --> 02:57:52,439
is about five about 500 million years
 

9563
02:57:52,439 --> 02:57:54,290
is about five about 500 million years
ago or something like that it is a

9564
02:57:54,290 --> 02:57:54,300
ago or something like that it is a
 

9565
02:57:54,300 --> 02:57:57,290
ago or something like that it is a
mind-altering trip of thinking about our

9566
02:57:57,290 --> 02:57:57,300
mind-altering trip of thinking about our
 

9567
02:57:57,300 --> 02:57:59,150
mind-altering trip of thinking about our
place in the universe I have to say plus

9568
02:57:59,150 --> 02:57:59,160
place in the universe I have to say plus
 

9569
02:57:59,160 --> 02:58:01,790
place in the universe I have to say plus
the Mind itself yeah is the kind of

9570
02:58:01,790 --> 02:58:01,800
the Mind itself yeah is the kind of
 

9571
02:58:01,800 --> 02:58:03,830
the Mind itself yeah is the kind of
alien but almost

9572
02:58:03,830 --> 02:58:03,840
alien but almost
 

9573
02:58:03,840 --> 02:58:04,550
alien but almost
um

9574
02:58:04,550 --> 02:58:04,560
um
 

9575
02:58:04,560 --> 02:58:06,710
um
almost a mystery to ourselves we still

9576
02:58:06,710 --> 02:58:06,720
almost a mystery to ourselves we still
 

9577
02:58:06,720 --> 02:58:08,210
almost a mystery to ourselves we still
don't understand it the very the very

9578
02:58:08,210 --> 02:58:08,220
don't understand it the very the very
 

9579
02:58:08,220 --> 02:58:10,309
don't understand it the very the very
mechanism that helps us explore the

9580
02:58:10,309 --> 02:58:10,319
mechanism that helps us explore the
 

9581
02:58:10,319 --> 02:58:13,370
mechanism that helps us explore the
world is still a mystery yeah so that

9582
02:58:13,370 --> 02:58:13,380
world is still a mystery yeah so that
 

9583
02:58:13,380 --> 02:58:16,730
world is still a mystery yeah so that
like understanding that will also unlock

9584
02:58:16,730 --> 02:58:16,740
like understanding that will also unlock
 

9585
02:58:16,740 --> 02:58:19,910
like understanding that will also unlock
um a quite quite possibly unlock our

9586
02:58:19,910 --> 02:58:19,920
um a quite quite possibly unlock our
 

9587
02:58:19,920 --> 02:58:21,530
um a quite quite possibly unlock our
ability to understand the world and

9588
02:58:21,530 --> 02:58:21,540
ability to understand the world and
 

9589
02:58:21,540 --> 02:58:22,969
ability to understand the world and
maybe build machines that help us

9590
02:58:22,969 --> 02:58:22,979
maybe build machines that help us
 

9591
02:58:22,979 --> 02:58:25,070
maybe build machines that help us
entertain the world build tools then I

9592
02:58:25,070 --> 02:58:25,080
entertain the world build tools then I
 

9593
02:58:25,080 --> 02:58:26,809
entertain the world build tools then I
mean it already has I mean our ability

9594
02:58:26,809 --> 02:58:26,819
mean it already has I mean our ability
 

9595
02:58:26,819 --> 02:58:29,809
mean it already has I mean our ability
to understand the world is is ridiculous

9596
02:58:29,809 --> 02:58:29,819
to understand the world is is ridiculous
 

9597
02:58:29,819 --> 02:58:30,450
to understand the world is is ridiculous

we're we're not there we're we're in a

9628
02:59:12,590 --> 02:59:12,600
we're we're not there we're we're in a
 

9629
02:59:12,600 --> 02:59:15,950
we're we're not there we're we're in a
place that you know in in you know you

9630
02:59:15,950 --> 02:59:15,960
place that you know in in you know you
 

9631
02:59:15,960 --> 02:59:17,389
place that you know in in you know you
know don't say the world's going to end

9632
02:59:17,389 --> 02:59:17,399
know don't say the world's going to end
 

9633
02:59:17,399 --> 02:59:19,610
know don't say the world's going to end
in 300 days or something it's not okay

9634
02:59:19,610 --> 02:59:19,620
in 300 days or something it's not okay
 

9635
02:59:19,620 --> 02:59:22,910
in 300 days or something it's not okay
and when we mean by this is that we have

9636
02:59:22,910 --> 02:59:22,920
and when we mean by this is that we have
 

9637
02:59:22,920 --> 02:59:25,010
and when we mean by this is that we have
a robust Society that's figured out how

9638
02:59:25,010 --> 02:59:25,020
a robust Society that's figured out how
 

9639
02:59:25,020 --> 02:59:26,690
a robust Society that's figured out how
to do like amazing things and we're

9640
02:59:26,690 --> 02:59:26,700
to do like amazing things and we're
 

9641
02:59:26,700 --> 02:59:29,389
to do like amazing things and we're
gonna keep doing amazing things but that

9642
02:59:29,389 --> 02:59:29,399
gonna keep doing amazing things but that
 

9643
02:59:29,399 --> 02:59:31,190
gonna keep doing amazing things but that
shouldn't be complacency

9644
02:59:31,190 --> 02:59:31,200
shouldn't be complacency
 

9645
02:59:31,200 --> 02:59:33,349
shouldn't be complacency
about what our future is and the future

9646
02:59:33,349 --> 02:59:33,359
about what our future is and the future
 

9647
02:59:33,359 --> 02:59:36,170
about what our future is and the future
for their children as well too and in

9648
02:59:36,170 --> 02:59:36,180
for their children as well too and in
 

9649
02:59:36,180 --> 02:59:38,450
for their children as well too and in
the end I mean it's a very it's a

9650
02:59:38,450 --> 02:59:38,460
the end I mean it's a very it's a
 

9651
02:59:38,460 --> 02:59:40,550
the end I mean it's a very it's a
staggering Legacy to think of what we've

9652
02:59:40,550 --> 02:59:40,560
staggering Legacy to think of what we've
 

9653
02:59:40,560 --> 02:59:43,010
staggering Legacy to think of what we've
built up primarily by basically using

9654
02:59:43,010 --> 02:59:43,020
built up primarily by basically using
 

9655
02:59:43,020 --> 02:59:44,870
built up primarily by basically using
carbon fuels like people almost tend to

9656
02:59:44,870 --> 02:59:44,880
carbon fuels like people almost tend to
 

9657
02:59:44,880 --> 02:59:46,370
carbon fuels like people almost tend to
think of this as an evil thing that

9658
02:59:46,370 --> 02:59:46,380
think of this as an evil thing that
 

9659
02:59:46,380 --> 02:59:48,530
think of this as an evil thing that
we've done I think it's an amazing thing

9660
02:59:48,530 --> 02:59:48,540
we've done I think it's an amazing thing
 

9661
02:59:48,540 --> 02:59:50,750
we've done I think it's an amazing thing
that we've done but we owe it to

9662
02:59:50,750 --> 02:59:50,760
that we've done but we owe it to
 

9663
02:59:50,760 --> 02:59:53,929
that we've done but we owe it to
ourselves and um and and to this thing

9664
02:59:53,929 --> 02:59:53,939
ourselves and um and and to this thing
 

9665
02:59:53,939 --> 02:59:55,250
ourselves and um and and to this thing
that we've built let me talk about the

9666
02:59:55,250 --> 02:59:55,260
that we've built let me talk about the
 

9667
02:59:55,260 --> 02:59:57,050
that we've built let me talk about the
end of the world is this nonsense what

9668
02:59:57,050 --> 02:59:57,060
end of the world is this nonsense what
 

9669
02:59:57,060 --> 02:59:59,450
end of the world is this nonsense what
it is is it's the end of this kind of

9670
02:59:59,450 --> 02:59:59,460
it is is it's the end of this kind of
 

9671
02:59:59,460 --> 03:00:02,690
it is is it's the end of this kind of
lifestyle and civilization at this scale

9672
03:00:02,690 --> 03:00:02,700
lifestyle and civilization at this scale
 

9673
03:00:02,700 --> 03:00:04,730
lifestyle and civilization at this scale
and the ability to execute on these

9674
03:00:04,730 --> 03:00:04,740
and the ability to execute on these
 

9675
03:00:04,740 --> 03:00:05,870
and the ability to execute on these
kinds of things that we were talking

9676
03:00:05,870 --> 03:00:05,880
kinds of things that we were talking
 

9677
03:00:05,880 --> 03:00:08,570
kinds of things that we were talking
about today like we are extraordinarily

9678
03:00:08,570 --> 03:00:08,580
about today like we are extraordinarily
 

9679
03:00:08,580 --> 03:00:11,090
about today like we are extraordinarily
privileged we are in a place where it's

9680
03:00:11,090 --> 03:00:11,100
privileged we are in a place where it's
 

9681
03:00:11,100 --> 03:00:13,429
privileged we are in a place where it's
just it's it's almost unfathomable

9682
03:00:13,429 --> 03:00:13,439
just it's it's almost unfathomable
 

9683
03:00:13,439 --> 03:00:15,710
just it's it's almost unfathomable
compared to most of the the misery that

9684
03:00:15,710 --> 03:00:15,720
compared to most of the the misery that
 

9685
03:00:15,720 --> 03:00:17,690
compared to most of the the misery that
humans have lived in for our history so

9686
03:00:17,690 --> 03:00:17,700
humans have lived in for our history so
 

9687
03:00:17,700 --> 03:00:20,450
humans have lived in for our history so
don't give up about this okay but also

9688
03:00:20,450 --> 03:00:20,460
don't give up about this okay but also
 

9689
03:00:20,460 --> 03:00:22,910
don't give up about this okay but also
roll up your sleeves and let's get going

9690
03:00:22,910 --> 03:00:22,920
roll up your sleeves and let's get going
 

9691
03:00:22,920 --> 03:00:25,370
roll up your sleeves and let's get going
at solving and getting real solutions to

9692
03:00:25,370 --> 03:00:25,380
at solving and getting real solutions to
 

9693
03:00:25,380 --> 03:00:26,570
at solving and getting real solutions to
the problems that are in front of us

9694
03:00:26,570 --> 03:00:26,580
the problems that are in front of us
 

9695
03:00:26,580 --> 03:00:29,929
the problems that are in front of us
which are significant you know it's I

9696
03:00:29,929 --> 03:00:29,939
which are significant you know it's I
 

9697
03:00:29,939 --> 03:00:32,210
which are significant you know it's I
would most of them are linked to how

9698
03:00:32,210 --> 03:00:32,220
would most of them are linked to how
 

9699
03:00:32,220 --> 03:00:34,309
would most of them are linked to how
what we use in energy but it's not just

9700
03:00:34,309 --> 03:00:34,319
what we use in energy but it's not just
 

9701
03:00:34,319 --> 03:00:36,410
what we use in energy but it's not just
that it's it's around all the aspects of

9702
03:00:36,410 --> 03:00:36,420
that it's it's around all the aspects of
 

9703
03:00:36,420 --> 03:00:38,090
that it's it's around all the aspects of
like what does it mean

9704
03:00:38,090 --> 03:00:38,100
like what does it mean
 

9705
03:00:38,100 --> 03:00:39,950
like what does it mean
like what does it mean to have a

9706
03:00:39,950 --> 03:00:39,960
like what does it mean to have a
 

9707
03:00:39,960 --> 03:00:41,630
like what does it mean to have a
distributed energy source that lifts

9708
03:00:41,630 --> 03:00:41,640
distributed energy source that lifts
 

9709
03:00:41,640 --> 03:00:43,790
distributed energy source that lifts
billions of people out of poverty you

9710
03:00:43,790 --> 03:00:43,800
billions of people out of poverty you
 

9711
03:00:43,800 --> 03:00:45,410
billions of people out of poverty you
know particularly outside of like the

9712
03:00:45,410 --> 03:00:45,420
know particularly outside of like the
 

9713
03:00:45,420 --> 03:00:48,050
know particularly outside of like the
Western Nations right that seems to me a

9714
03:00:48,050 --> 03:00:48,060
Western Nations right that seems to me a
 

9715
03:00:48,060 --> 03:00:51,170
Western Nations right that seems to me a
pretty compelling you know moral goal

9716
03:00:51,170 --> 03:00:51,180
pretty compelling you know moral goal
 

9717
03:00:51,180 --> 03:00:53,389
pretty compelling you know moral goal
for our for all of us

03:00:53,389 --> 03:00:53,399
for our for all of us
 

9719
03:00:53,399 --> 03:00:55,550

you know uh generation and then the

9722
03:00:58,070 --> 03:00:58,080
you know uh generation and then the
 

9723
03:00:58,080 --> 03:00:59,990
you know uh generation and then the
other part is that is that we've got

9724
03:00:59,990 --> 03:01:00,000
other part is that is that we've got
 

9725
03:01:00,000 --> 03:01:02,929
other part is that is that we've got
possible solutions in front of us apply

9726
03:01:02,929 --> 03:01:02,939
possible solutions in front of us apply
 

9727
03:01:02,939 --> 03:01:05,870
possible solutions in front of us apply
your talents in a way that that that

9728
03:01:05,870 --> 03:01:05,880
your talents in a way that that that
 

9729
03:01:05,880 --> 03:01:09,110

you're passionate about and is going to
 

9731
03:01:09,120 --> 03:01:10,610
you're passionate about and is going to
make a difference

9732
03:01:10,610 --> 03:01:10,620
make a difference
 

9733
03:01:10,620 --> 03:01:12,950
make a difference
and that's only possible with the

9734
03:01:12,950 --> 03:01:12,960
and that's only possible with the
 

9735
03:01:12,960 --> 03:01:16,910
and that's only possible with the
optimism hope and hard work yeah what uh

9736
03:01:16,910 --> 03:01:16,920
optimism hope and hard work yeah what uh
 

9737
03:01:16,920 --> 03:01:18,889
optimism hope and hard work yeah what uh
easy question

9738
03:01:18,889 --> 03:01:18,899
easy question
 

9739
03:01:18,899 --> 03:01:21,050
easy question
certainly easier than nuclear fusion

9740
03:01:21,050 --> 03:01:21,060
certainly easier than nuclear fusion
 

9741
03:01:21,060 --> 03:01:23,510
certainly easier than nuclear fusion
what's the meaning of life why are we

9742
03:01:23,510 --> 03:01:23,520
what's the meaning of life why are we
 

9743
03:01:23,520 --> 03:01:27,650
what's the meaning of life why are we
here 42 is it 42 no no

9744
03:01:27,650 --> 03:01:27,660
here 42 is it 42 no no
 

9745
03:01:27,660 --> 03:01:29,809
here 42 is it 42 no no
um we already discussed about the beauty

9746
03:01:29,809 --> 03:01:29,819
um we already discussed about the beauty
 

9747
03:01:29,819 --> 03:01:31,370
um we already discussed about the beauty
of physics that there's almost a desire

9748
03:01:31,370 --> 03:01:31,380
of physics that there's almost a desire
 

9749
03:01:31,380 --> 03:01:32,990
of physics that there's almost a desire
to ask a why question about why the

9750
03:01:32,990 --> 03:01:33,000
to ask a why question about why the
 

9751
03:01:33,000 --> 03:01:35,389
to ask a why question about why the
parameters have these values yeah

9752
03:01:35,389 --> 03:01:35,399
parameters have these values yeah
 

9753
03:01:35,399 --> 03:01:38,269
parameters have these values yeah
it's very tempting yeah it's it's an

9754
03:01:38,269 --> 03:01:38,279
it's very tempting yeah it's it's an
 

9755
03:01:38,279 --> 03:01:39,410
it's very tempting yeah it's it's an
interesting

9756
03:01:39,410 --> 03:01:39,420
interesting
 

9757
03:01:39,420 --> 03:01:41,929
interesting
hole to go down as a scientist because

9758
03:01:41,929 --> 03:01:41,939
hole to go down as a scientist because
 

9759
03:01:41,939 --> 03:01:45,410
hole to go down as a scientist because
we're a part of what people have a hard

9760
03:01:45,410 --> 03:01:45,420
we're a part of what people have a hard
 

9761
03:01:45,420 --> 03:01:47,330
we're a part of what people have a hard
time people who aren't scientists have a

9762
03:01:47,330 --> 03:01:47,340
time people who aren't scientists have a
 

9763
03:01:47,340 --> 03:01:48,710
time people who aren't scientists have a
hard time understanding what scientists

9764
03:01:48,710 --> 03:01:48,720
hard time understanding what scientists
 

9765
03:01:48,720 --> 03:01:51,290
hard time understanding what scientists
do to themselves and a great scientist

9766
03:01:51,290 --> 03:01:51,300
do to themselves and a great scientist
 

9767
03:01:51,300 --> 03:01:54,290
do to themselves and a great scientist
does a very non-intuitive or non-human

9768
03:01:54,290 --> 03:01:54,300
does a very non-intuitive or non-human
 

9769
03:01:54,300 --> 03:01:56,510
does a very non-intuitive or non-human
thing what we do is we train ourselves

9770
03:01:56,510 --> 03:01:56,520
thing what we do is we train ourselves
 

9771
03:01:56,520 --> 03:01:58,849
thing what we do is we train ourselves
to doubt ourselves like hell like that's

9772
03:01:58,849 --> 03:01:58,859
to doubt ourselves like hell like that's
 

9773
03:01:58,859 --> 03:02:01,070
to doubt ourselves like hell like that's
a great scientist we doubt everything we

9774
03:02:01,070 --> 03:02:01,080
a great scientist we doubt everything we
 

9775
03:02:01,080 --> 03:02:03,050
a great scientist we doubt everything we
see we doubt everything that we think

9776
03:02:03,050 --> 03:02:03,060
see we doubt everything that we think
 

9777
03:02:03,060 --> 03:02:07,130
see we doubt everything that we think
because we we try to we we basically try

9778
03:02:07,130 --> 03:02:07,140
because we we try to we we basically try
 

9779
03:02:07,140 --> 03:02:10,190
because we we try to we we basically try
to turn off the belief valve right that

9780
03:02:10,190 --> 03:02:10,200
to turn off the belief valve right that
 

9781
03:02:10,200 --> 03:02:13,309
to turn off the belief valve right that
humans just naturally have

9782
03:02:13,309 --> 03:02:13,319
humans just naturally have
 

9783
03:02:13,319 --> 03:02:15,349
humans just naturally have
um so when it comes to these things like

9784
03:02:15,349 --> 03:02:15,359
um so when it comes to these things like
 

9785
03:02:15,359 --> 03:02:17,389
um so when it comes to these things like
I can I can make my own comments to this

9786
03:02:17,389 --> 03:02:17,399
I can I can make my own comments to this
 

9787
03:02:17,399 --> 03:02:19,790
I can I can make my own comments to this
is like personally you see these things

9788
03:02:19,790 --> 03:02:19,800
is like personally you see these things
 

9789
03:02:19,800 --> 03:02:21,469
is like personally you see these things
about the ratios of life and I made a

9790
03:02:21,469 --> 03:02:21,479
about the ratios of life and I made a
 

9791
03:02:21,479 --> 03:02:22,910
about the ratios of life and I made a
comment where I said well you know a

9792
03:02:22,910 --> 03:02:22,920
comment where I said well you know a
 

9793
03:02:22,920 --> 03:02:25,010
comment where I said well you know a
wrap my some part of my brain that just

9794
03:02:25,010 --> 03:02:25,020
wrap my some part of my brain that just
 

9795
03:02:25,020 --> 03:02:27,710
wrap my some part of my brain that just
goes Yeah well yeah because we're the

9796
03:02:27,710 --> 03:02:27,720
goes Yeah well yeah because we're the
 

9797
03:02:27,720 --> 03:02:29,389
goes Yeah well yeah because we're the
only interesting you know Multiverse

9798
03:02:29,389 --> 03:02:29,399
only interesting you know Multiverse
 

9799
03:02:29,399 --> 03:02:31,370
only interesting you know Multiverse
because by definition it has to look

9800
03:02:31,370 --> 03:02:31,380
because by definition it has to look
 

9801
03:02:31,380 --> 03:02:33,230
because by definition it has to look
like this you know

9802
03:02:33,230 --> 03:02:33,240
like this you know
 

9803
03:02:33,240 --> 03:02:34,910
like this you know
but there's I have to say there's other

9804
03:02:34,910 --> 03:02:34,920
but there's I have to say there's other
 

9805
03:02:34,920 --> 03:02:37,070
but there's I have to say there's other
times I can say in the history of the

9806
03:02:37,070 --> 03:02:37,080
times I can say in the history of the
 

9807
03:02:37,080 --> 03:02:39,170
times I can say in the history of the
whole of what has happened over the last

9808
03:02:39,170 --> 03:02:39,180
whole of what has happened over the last
 

9809
03:02:39,180 --> 03:02:41,150
whole of what has happened over the last
10 years there have been some pretty

9810
03:02:41,150 --> 03:02:41,160
10 years there have been some pretty
 

9811
03:02:41,160 --> 03:02:43,550
10 years there have been some pretty
weird coincidences like coincidences

9812
03:02:43,550 --> 03:02:43,560
weird coincidences like coincidences
 

9813
03:02:43,560 --> 03:02:46,190
weird coincidences like coincidences
that like you look at it and just go is

9814
03:02:46,190 --> 03:02:46,200
that like you look at it and just go is
 

9815
03:02:46,200 --> 03:02:48,050
that like you look at it and just go is
that really was that really a

9816
03:02:48,050 --> 03:02:48,060
that really was that really a
 

9817
03:02:48,060 --> 03:02:49,269
that really was that really a
coincidence

9818
03:02:49,269 --> 03:02:49,279
coincidence
 

9819
03:02:49,279 --> 03:02:52,610
coincidence
is something like pushing us toward

9820
03:02:52,610 --> 03:02:52,620
is something like pushing us toward
 

9821
03:02:52,620 --> 03:02:55,070
is something like pushing us toward
towards these things and it's a natural

9822
03:02:55,070 --> 03:02:55,080
towards these things and it's a natural
 

9823
03:02:55,080 --> 03:02:56,929
towards these things and it's a natural
it's a human instinct because you know

9824
03:02:56,929 --> 03:02:56,939
it's a human instinct because you know
 

9825
03:02:56,939 --> 03:02:59,150
it's a human instinct because you know
since the beginnings of humanity we've

9826
03:02:59,150 --> 03:02:59,160
since the beginnings of humanity we've
 

9827
03:02:59,160 --> 03:03:02,389
since the beginnings of humanity we've
always assigned you know you know human

you said the antithesis to sort of
 

9847
03:03:25,319 --> 03:03:28,429
you said the antithesis to sort of
scientific doubt is is having a faith in

silly when uh looked at from a
 

9853
03:03:33,660 --> 03:03:35,570
silly when uh looked at from a
scientific perspective but just even the

9854
03:03:35,570 --> 03:03:35,580
scientific perspective but just even the
 

9855
03:03:35,580 --> 03:03:38,090
scientific perspective but just even the
feelings of it seems that love is a

03:03:40,389 --> 03:03:40,399
fundamental fabric of human uh condition
 

9859
03:03:40,399 --> 03:03:44,950
fundamental fabric of human uh condition
and what the hell is that

9860
03:03:44,950 --> 03:03:44,960

 

9861
03:03:44,960 --> 03:03:48,830

as the physicist I go it's you know this

9862
03:03:48,830 --> 03:03:48,840
as the physicist I go it's you know this
 

9863
03:03:48,840 --> 03:03:51,230
as the physicist I go it's you know this
is this is a repeatable thing that's due

9864
03:03:51,230 --> 03:03:51,240
is this is a repeatable thing that's due
 

9865
03:03:51,240 --> 03:03:53,330
is this is a repeatable thing that's due
to a set of synapses that fire in a

9866
03:03:53,330 --> 03:03:53,340
to a set of synapses that fire in a
 

9867
03:03:53,340 --> 03:03:54,950
to a set of synapses that fire in a
particular pattern and all this yes you

9868
03:03:54,950 --> 03:03:54,960
particular pattern and all this yes you
 

9869
03:03:54,960 --> 03:03:56,809
particular pattern and all this yes you
know that's kind of like okay man what a

9870
03:03:56,809 --> 03:03:56,819
know that's kind of like okay man what a
 

9871
03:03:56,819 --> 03:03:58,309
know that's kind of like okay man what a
you know what a drag that is right to

9872
03:03:58,309 --> 03:03:58,319
you know what a drag that is right to
 

9873
03:03:58,319 --> 03:03:59,750
you know what a drag that is right to
think of it this way and you can have an

9874
03:03:59,750 --> 03:03:59,760
think of it this way and you can have an
 

9875
03:03:59,760 --> 03:04:01,910
think of it this way and you can have an
evolutionary biology explanation but

9876
03:04:01,910 --> 03:04:01,920
evolutionary biology explanation but
 

9877
03:04:01,920 --> 03:04:03,650
evolutionary biology explanation but
there's still a magic to it I mean I see

9878
03:04:03,650 --> 03:04:03,660
there's still a magic to it I mean I see
 

9879
03:04:03,660 --> 03:04:05,450
there's still a magic to it I mean I see
scientists I have some of my colleagues

9880
03:04:05,450 --> 03:04:05,460
scientists I have some of my colleagues
 

9881
03:04:05,460 --> 03:04:07,610
scientists I have some of my colleagues
you know do this as well too like where

9882
03:04:07,610 --> 03:04:07,620
you know do this as well too like where
 

9883
03:04:07,620 --> 03:04:10,370
you know do this as well too like where
what what is spirituality compared to

what what is spirituality compared to
 

9885
03:04:10,380 --> 03:04:13,670
what what is spirituality compared to
science and so forth I my own my own

9886
03:04:13,670 --> 03:04:13,680
science and so forth I my own my own
 

9887
03:04:13,680 --> 03:04:16,130
science and so forth I my own my own
feeling in this is that

9888
03:04:16,130 --> 03:04:16,140
feeling in this is that
 

9889
03:04:16,140 --> 03:04:18,170
feeling in this is that
you know as a scientist because I've had

9890
03:04:18,170 --> 03:04:18,180
you know as a scientist because I've had
 

9891
03:04:18,180 --> 03:04:20,630
you know as a scientist because I've had
the pleasure of being able to like both

9892
03:04:20,630 --> 03:04:20,640
the pleasure of being able to like both
 

9893
03:04:20,640 --> 03:04:23,030
the pleasure of being able to like both
understand what my predecessors did but

9894
03:04:23,030 --> 03:04:23,040
understand what my predecessors did but
 

9895
03:04:23,040 --> 03:04:24,710
understand what my predecessors did but
I also had the privilege of being able

9896
03:04:24,710 --> 03:04:24,720
I also had the privilege of being able
 

9897
03:04:24,720 --> 03:04:26,929
I also had the privilege of being able
to discover things right as a scientist

9898
03:04:26,929 --> 03:04:26,939
to discover things right as a scientist
 

9899
03:04:26,939 --> 03:04:27,889
to discover things right as a scientist
and

9900
03:04:27,889 --> 03:04:27,899
and
 

9901
03:04:27,899 --> 03:04:30,769
and
and I see that and you just in just in

9902
03:04:30,769 --> 03:04:30,779
and I see that and you just in just in
 

9903

just the range of our conversations like
 

9905
03:04:32,939 --> 03:04:36,410
just the range of our conversations like
that is my in a weird way my it's the

that is my in a weird way my it's the
 

9907
03:04:36,420 --> 03:04:39,710
that is my in a weird way my it's the
awe that comes from looking at that that

9908
03:04:39,710 --> 03:04:39,720
awe that comes from looking at that that
 

9909
03:04:39,720 --> 03:04:43,010
awe that comes from looking at that that
is if you're not in awe of the universe

9910
03:04:43,010 --> 03:04:43,020
is if you're not in awe of the universe
 

9911
03:04:43,020 --> 03:04:44,750
is if you're not in awe of the universe
and nature you haven't been paying

9912
03:04:44,750 --> 03:04:44,760
and nature you haven't been paying
 

9913
03:04:44,760 --> 03:04:46,550
and nature you haven't been paying
attention I mean my own personal feeling

9914
03:04:46,550 --> 03:04:46,560
attention I mean my own personal feeling
 

9915
03:04:46,560 --> 03:04:48,410
attention I mean my own personal feeling
is that I feel

9916
03:04:48,410 --> 03:04:48,420
is that I feel
 

9917
03:04:48,420 --> 03:04:53,090
is that I feel
uh if I go if I go snorkeling on a coral

9918
03:04:53,090 --> 03:04:53,100
uh if I go if I go snorkeling on a coral
 

9919
03:04:53,100 --> 03:04:55,309
uh if I go if I go snorkeling on a coral
reef I feel more awe than I could ever

9920
03:04:55,309 --> 03:04:55,319
reef I feel more awe than I could ever
 

9921
03:04:55,319 --> 03:04:57,590
reef I feel more awe than I could ever
feel like in a in a church you kind of

9922
03:04:57,590 --> 03:04:57,600
feel like in a in a church you kind of
 

9923
03:04:57,600 --> 03:05:00,290
feel like in a in a church you kind of
notice some kind of magic there there's

9924
03:05:00,290 --> 03:05:00,300
notice some kind of magic there there's
 

9925
03:05:00,300 --> 03:05:02,389
notice some kind of magic there there's
something about the way the whole darn

9926
03:05:02,389 --> 03:05:02,399
something about the way the whole darn
 

9927
03:05:02,399 --> 03:05:05,389
something about the way the whole darn
thing holds together that just sort of

9928
03:05:05,389 --> 03:05:05,399
thing holds together that just sort of
 

9929
03:05:05,399 --> 03:05:08,090
thing holds together that just sort of
escapes your imagination and that's to

9930
03:05:08,090 --> 03:05:08,100
escapes your imagination and that's to
 

9931
03:05:08,100 --> 03:05:10,429
escapes your imagination and that's to
me the this thing of and then we have

9932
03:05:10,429 --> 03:05:10,439
me the this thing of and then we have
 

9933
03:05:10,439 --> 03:05:12,650
me the this thing of and then we have
different words we call them holistic or

9934
03:05:12,650 --> 03:05:12,660
different words we call them holistic or
 

9935
03:05:12,660 --> 03:05:14,990
different words we call them holistic or
spiritual the way that it all hangs

9936
03:05:14,990 --> 03:05:15,000
spiritual the way that it all hangs
 

9937
03:05:15,000 --> 03:05:16,370
spiritual the way that it all hangs
together in fact one of the interesting

9938
03:05:16,370 --> 03:05:16,380
together in fact one of the interesting
 

9939
03:05:16,380 --> 03:05:17,809
together in fact one of the interesting
things you asked about like what I think

9940
03:05:17,809 --> 03:05:17,819
things you asked about like what I think
 

9941
03:05:17,819 --> 03:05:20,090
things you asked about like what I think
about well the craziest things that I

9942
03:05:20,090 --> 03:05:20,100
about well the craziest things that I
 

9943
03:05:20,100 --> 03:05:21,710
about well the craziest things that I
think that how does it hold together is

9944
03:05:21,710 --> 03:05:21,720
think that how does it hold together is
 

9945
03:05:21,720 --> 03:05:24,889
think that how does it hold together is
like our society like how does oh look

9946
03:05:24,889 --> 03:05:24,899
like our society like how does oh look
 

9947
03:05:24,899 --> 03:05:28,070
like our society like how does oh look
what yeah like how because there's no

9948
03:05:28,070 --> 03:05:28,080
what yeah like how because there's no
 

9949
03:05:28,080 --> 03:05:29,570
what yeah like how because there's no
way like you just think of the United

9950
03:05:29,570 --> 03:05:29,580
way like you just think of the United
 

9951
03:05:29,580 --> 03:05:33,290
way like you just think of the United
States there's 330 million people kind

9952
03:05:33,290 --> 03:05:33,300
States there's 330 million people kind
 

9953
03:05:33,300 --> 03:05:36,230
States there's 330 million people kind
of working like this engine about going

9954
03:05:36,230 --> 03:05:36,240
of working like this engine about going
 

9955
03:05:36,240 --> 03:05:38,150
of working like this engine about going
towards making all these things happen

9956
03:05:38,150 --> 03:05:38,160
towards making all these things happen
 

9957
03:05:38,160 --> 03:05:40,070
towards making all these things happen
but there's like no one in charge of

9958
03:05:40,070 --> 03:05:40,080
but there's like no one in charge of
 

9959
03:05:40,080 --> 03:05:42,769
but there's like no one in charge of
this really not really yeah how the how

9960
03:05:42,769 --> 03:05:42,779
this really not really yeah how the how
 

9961
03:05:42,779 --> 03:05:44,690
this really not really yeah how the how
the heck does this happen it's kind of

9962
03:05:44,690 --> 03:05:44,700
the heck does this happen it's kind of
 

9963
03:05:44,700 --> 03:05:47,510
the heck does this happen it's kind of
like it's so the these things these are

9964
03:05:47,510 --> 03:05:47,520
like it's so the these things these are
 

9965
03:05:47,520 --> 03:05:48,349
like it's so the these things these are
the kinds of things mathematics

9966
03:05:48,349 --> 03:05:48,359
the kinds of things mathematics
 

9967
03:05:48,359 --> 03:05:50,570
the kinds of things mathematics
automatically and organization wise that

9968
03:05:50,570 --> 03:05:50,580
automatically and organization wise that
 

9969
03:05:50,580 --> 03:05:53,030
automatically and organization wise that
I think of just because they're they're

9970
03:05:53,030 --> 03:05:53,040
I think of just because they're they're
 

9971
03:05:53,040 --> 03:05:54,889
I think of just because they're they're
sort of they're awe-inspiring and

9972
03:05:54,889 --> 03:05:54,899
sort of they're awe-inspiring and
 

9973
03:05:54,899 --> 03:05:55,910
sort of they're awe-inspiring and
there's different

9974
03:05:55,910 --> 03:05:55,920
there's different
 

9975
03:05:55,920 --> 03:05:58,010
there's different
ideas that would come up together we

9976
03:05:58,010 --> 03:05:58,020
ideas that would come up together we
 

9977
03:05:58,020 --> 03:06:00,290
ideas that would come up together we
share them and then there's uh there's

9978
03:06:00,290 --> 03:06:00,300
share them and then there's uh there's
 

9979
03:06:00,300 --> 03:06:01,610
share them and then there's uh there's
teams of people that share different

9980
03:06:01,610 --> 03:06:01,620
teams of people that share different
 

9981
03:06:01,620 --> 03:06:03,349
teams of people that share different
ideas and those ideas compete like

9982
03:06:03,349 --> 03:06:03,359
ideas and those ideas compete like
 

9983
03:06:03,359 --> 03:06:05,269
ideas and those ideas compete like
there's the ideas themselves are these

9984
03:06:05,269 --> 03:06:05,279
there's the ideas themselves are these
 

9985
03:06:05,279 --> 03:06:06,530
there's the ideas themselves are these
kinds of different organisms and

9986
03:06:06,530 --> 03:06:06,540
kinds of different organisms and
 

9987
03:06:06,540 --> 03:06:08,929
kinds of different organisms and
ultimately somehow we build Bridges and

9988
03:06:08,929 --> 03:06:08,939
ultimately somehow we build Bridges and
 

9989
03:06:08,939 --> 03:06:10,910
ultimately somehow we build Bridges and
and nuclear reactors and do those things

9990
03:06:10,910 --> 03:06:10,920
and nuclear reactors and do those things
 

9991
03:06:10,920 --> 03:06:12,769
and nuclear reactors and do those things
well I have to give a shout out to my

9992
03:06:12,769 --> 03:06:12,779
well I have to give a shout out to my
 

9993
03:06:12,779 --> 03:06:13,849
well I have to give a shout out to my
daughter by the way who's who's

9994
03:06:13,849 --> 03:06:13,859
daughter by the way who's who's
 

9995
03:06:13,859 --> 03:06:16,010
daughter by the way who's who's
interested she's an applied math major

9996
03:06:16,010 --> 03:06:16,020
interested she's an applied math major
 

9997
03:06:16,020 --> 03:06:18,290
interested she's an applied math major
and she's she's amazing at math and over

9998
03:06:18,290 --> 03:06:18,300
and she's she's amazing at math and over
 

9999
03:06:18,300 --> 03:06:19,670
and she's she's amazing at math and over
the break she was showing she's doing

10000
03:06:19,670 --> 03:06:19,680
the break she was showing she's doing
 

10001
03:06:19,680 --> 03:06:22,250
the break she was showing she's doing
researches it's basically about how

10002
03:06:22,250 --> 03:06:22,260
researches it's basically about how
 

10003
03:06:22,260 --> 03:06:26,150
researches it's basically about how
ideas and Ethos are transmitted within a

10004
03:06:26,150 --> 03:06:26,160
ideas and Ethos are transmitted within a
 

10005
03:06:26,160 --> 03:06:27,950
ideas and Ethos are transmitted within a
society nice so she's building an

10006
03:06:27,950 --> 03:06:27,960
society nice so she's building an
 

10007
03:06:27,960 --> 03:06:30,670
society nice so she's building an
applied math model who's explaining like

10008
03:06:30,670 --> 03:06:30,680
applied math model who's explaining like
 

10009
03:06:30,680 --> 03:06:32,870
applied math model who's explaining like
she was showing me on this like the

10010
03:06:32,870 --> 03:06:32,880
she was showing me on this like the
 

10011
03:06:32,880 --> 03:06:34,730
she was showing me on this like the
simulation she goes oh look look at this

10012
03:06:34,730 --> 03:06:34,740
simulation she goes oh look look at this
 

10013
03:06:34,740 --> 03:06:36,830
simulation she goes oh look look at this
and I said oh oh that's like how

10014
03:06:36,830 --> 03:06:36,840
and I said oh oh that's like how
 

10015
03:06:36,840 --> 03:06:39,349
and I said oh oh that's like how
political parties like evolve right yeah

10016
03:06:39,349 --> 03:06:39,359
political parties like evolve right yeah
 

10017
03:06:39,359 --> 03:06:40,730
political parties like evolve right yeah
and even though it was a rather you know

10018
03:06:40,730 --> 03:06:40,740
and even though it was a rather you know
 

10019
03:06:40,740 --> 03:06:43,010
and even though it was a rather you know
quote-unquote simple math mathematical

10020
03:06:43,010 --> 03:06:43,020
quote-unquote simple math mathematical
 

10021
03:06:43,020 --> 03:06:46,570
quote-unquote simple math mathematical
model it wasn't really it's like oh wow

10022
03:06:46,570 --> 03:06:46,580
model it wasn't really it's like oh wow
 

10023
03:06:46,580 --> 03:06:49,190
model it wasn't really it's like oh wow
well maybe she has a chance to derive

10024
03:06:49,190 --> 03:06:49,200
well maybe she has a chance to derive
 

10025
03:06:49,200 --> 03:06:51,110
well maybe she has a chance to derive
mathematically the the answer to the

10026
03:06:51,110 --> 03:06:51,120
mathematically the the answer to the
 

10027
03:06:51,120 --> 03:06:52,910
mathematically the the answer to the
what's the meaning of life there we go

10028
03:06:52,910 --> 03:06:52,920
what's the meaning of life there we go
 

10029
03:06:52,920 --> 03:06:55,550
what's the meaning of life there we go
and maybe it is indeed 42. well

10030
03:06:55,550 --> 03:06:55,560
and maybe it is indeed 42. well
 

10031
03:06:55,560 --> 03:06:57,590
and maybe it is indeed 42. well

ideas in all of uh human endeavor which
 

10043
03:07:09,300 --> 03:07:11,929
ideas in all of uh human endeavor which
is nuclear fusion I mean that's so

10044
03:07:11,929 --> 03:07:11,939
is nuclear fusion I mean that's so
 

10045
03:07:11,939 --> 03:07:14,330
is nuclear fusion I mean that's so
interesting you know it's almost like my

10046
03:07:14,330 --> 03:07:14,340
interesting you know it's almost like my
 

10047
