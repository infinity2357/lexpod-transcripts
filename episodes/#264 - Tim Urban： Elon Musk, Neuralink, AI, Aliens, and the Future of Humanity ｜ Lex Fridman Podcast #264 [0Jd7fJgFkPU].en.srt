get enough of the bigness of space and

89
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:39,270
mystery that we don't know what's out
there we know how it works perhaps like

90
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:39,280
there we know how it works perhaps like
 

91
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,270
there we know how it works perhaps like
general relativity can tell us how the

born all that kind of things
 

97
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,749
born all that kind of things
but like how many lit how many

98
00:01:47,749 --> 00:01:47,759
but like how many lit how many
 

99
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,590

civilizations are out there how many
 

101
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,109

like what are the weird things that are

102
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:51,119
like what are the weird things that are
 

103
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,270
like what are the weird things that are
also yeah life well extraterrestrial

104
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:53,280
also yeah life well extraterrestrial
 

105
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,870
also yeah life well extraterrestrial
life is a true mystery the most

106

tantalizing mystery of all um

108
00:01:57,749 --> 00:01:57,759
tantalizing mystery of all um
 

109
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,990
tantalizing mystery of all um
uh but that that's like our size so

110
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:00,000
uh but that that's like our size so
 

111
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,389
uh but that that's like our size so
that's maybe it's that the the actual uh

112
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:02,399
that's maybe it's that the the actual uh
 

113
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:03,910
that's maybe it's that the the actual uh
the big and the small are really cool

114
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:03,920
the big and the small are really cool
 

115
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,270
the big and the small are really cool
but it's actually the things that are

116
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:05,280
but it's actually the things that are
 

117
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,870
but it's actually the things that are
potentially our size that are the most

118
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:06,880
potentially our size that are the most
 

119
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,109
potentially our size that are the most
tantalizing potentially our size is

120
00:02:09,109 --> 00:02:09,119
tantalizing potentially our size is
 

121
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,949
tantalizing potentially our size is
probably the key word yeah i mean i

122
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:10,959
probably the key word yeah i mean i
 

123
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,550
probably the key word yeah i mean i
wonder how small intelligent life could

124
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:12,560
wonder how small intelligent life could
 

125
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,830
wonder how small intelligent life could
get probably not that small um and i

126
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:15,840
get probably not that small um and i
 

127
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,750
get probably not that small um and i
assume that there's a limit that you're

128
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:17,760
assume that there's a limit that you're
 

129
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,110
assume that there's a limit that you're
not gonna i mean you might have like a

130
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:19,120
not gonna i mean you might have like a
 

131
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,589
not gonna i mean you might have like a
whale blue whale sized intelligent being

132
00:02:21,589 --> 00:02:21,599
whale blue whale sized intelligent being
 

133
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,550
whale blue whale sized intelligent being
that would be kind of cool um but i i

134
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:24,560
that would be kind of cool um but i i
 

135
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,070
that would be kind of cool um but i i
feel like it's we're in the range of

136
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:26,080
feel like it's we're in the range of
 

137
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,670
feel like it's we're in the range of
order of magnitude smaller and bigger

order of magnitude smaller and bigger
 

139
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,430
order of magnitude smaller and bigger
than us for life but maybe maybe not

of self-assembling
organisms and they just get bigger and

166
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:53,200
organisms and they just get bigger and
 

167
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,710
organisms and they just get bigger and
bigger and bigger like there's no such

168
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:54,720
bigger and bigger like there's no such
 

169
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,470
bigger and bigger like there's no such
thing as a human being a human being is

170
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:56,480
thing as a human being a human being is
 

171
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,630
thing as a human being a human being is
made up of a bunch of tiny organisms

172
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:58,640
made up of a bunch of tiny organisms
 

173
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,630
made up of a bunch of tiny organisms
like working together and we somehow

174
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:00,640
like working together and we somehow
 

175
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,229
like working together and we somehow
envision that as one

176
00:03:02,229 --> 00:03:02,239
envision that as one
 

177
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,550
envision that as one
entity because it has consciousness but

178
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:04,560
entity because it has consciousness but
 

179
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,630
entity because it has consciousness but
maybe it's just organisms on top of

180
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:06,640
maybe it's just organisms on top of
 

181
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,910
maybe it's just organisms on top of
organisms

182
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:07,920
organisms
 

183
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,910
organisms
organisms all the way down turtles all

184
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:09,920
organisms all the way down turtles all
 

185
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,149
organisms all the way down turtles all
the way down so like earth can be seen

186
00:03:12,149 --> 00:03:12,159
the way down so like earth can be seen
 

187
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,350
the way down so like earth can be seen
as an organism for people for um

188
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:15,360
as an organism for people for um
 

189
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,229
as an organism for people for um
alien species that's very different

190
00:03:18,229 --> 00:03:18,239
alien species that's very different
 

191
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,869
alien species that's very different
like why is the human the fundamental

192
00:03:20,869 --> 00:03:20,879
like why is the human the fundamental
 

193
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,430
like why is the human the fundamental
entity that is living

194
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:23,440
entity that is living
 

195
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,190
entity that is living
and then every everything else is just

196
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:25,200
and then every everything else is just
 

197
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,030
and then every everything else is just
either a collection of humans or

198
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:27,040
either a collection of humans or
 

199
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,110
either a collection of humans or
components of humans i think if it kind

200
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:29,120
components of humans i think if it kind
 

201
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,789
components of humans i think if it kind
of is if you think about i think of like

202
00:03:30,789 --> 00:03:30,799
of is if you think about i think of like
 

203
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,470
of is if you think about i think of like
an emergence elevator

204
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:32,480
an emergence elevator
 

205
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,550
an emergence elevator
and so you've got

206
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:34,560
and so you've got
 

207
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,190
and so you've got
an ant is on one floor and then the ant

208
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:37,200
an ant is on one floor and then the ant
 

209
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,350
an ant is on one floor and then the ant
colonies you know a floor above

210
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:39,360
colonies you know a floor above
 

211
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,789
colonies you know a floor above
or maybe there's even units within the

212
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:40,799
or maybe there's even units within the
 

213
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,149
or maybe there's even units within the
colony that's one floor above and the

214
00:03:42,149 --> 00:03:42,159
colony that's one floor above and the
 

215
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,869
colony that's one floor above and the
full colonies of two floors above and to

216
00:03:44,869 --> 00:03:44,879
full colonies of two floors above and to
 

217
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,110
full colonies of two floors above and to
me i think that it's the colony that is

218
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:47,120
me i think that it's the colony that is
 

219
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,430
me i think that it's the colony that is
the closest to being the animal uh it's

220
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:49,440
the closest to being the animal uh it's
 

221
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,270
the closest to being the animal uh it's
like the the individual thing where that

222
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:51,280
like the the individual thing where that
 

223
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,550
like the the individual thing where that
competes

224
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:52,560
competes
 

225
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,270
competes
with others um while the

226
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:55,280
with others um while the
 

227
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,589
with others um while the
the individual ants are like cells in

228
00:03:57,589 --> 00:03:57,599
the individual ants are like cells in
 

229
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,229
the individual ants are like cells in
the animal's body we are more like a

230
00:04:00,229 --> 00:04:00,239
the animal's body we are more like a
 

231
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,470
the animal's body we are more like a
colony in that regard but the the humans

232
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:02,480
colony in that regard but the the humans
 

233
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,710
colony in that regard but the the humans
are weird because we kind of we i think

234
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:04,720
are weird because we kind of we i think
 

235
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,630
are weird because we kind of we i think
of it if emergence happens in an

236
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:06,640
of it if emergence happens in an
 

237
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,990
of it if emergence happens in an
emergency tower

238
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,000
emergency tower
 

239
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,270
emergency tower
where you've got kind of you know as i

240
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:09,280
where you've got kind of you know as i
 

241
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,589
where you've got kind of you know as i
said cells and then humans and

242
00:04:11,589 --> 00:04:11,599
said cells and then humans and
 

243
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,830
said cells and then humans and
communities and societies ants are very

244
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:13,840
communities and societies ants are very
 

245
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,670
communities and societies ants are very
specific you know the individual ants

246
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:15,680
specific you know the individual ants
 

247
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,590
specific you know the individual ants
are always cooperating with each other

248
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:17,600
are always cooperating with each other
 

249
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,349
are always cooperating with each other
uh for the sake of the colony so the

250
00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:19,359
uh for the sake of the colony so the
 

251
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,189
uh for the sake of the colony so the
colony is this unit that is that is the

252
00:04:21,189 --> 00:04:21,199
colony is this unit that is that is the
 

253
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,710
colony is this unit that is that is the
competitive unit

254
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:22,720
competitive unit
 

255
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,629
competitive unit
humans can kind of go we take the

256
00:04:24,629 --> 00:04:24,639
humans can kind of go we take the
 

257
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,390
humans can kind of go we take the
elevator up and down emergence tower

258
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:26,400
elevator up and down emergence tower
 

259
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,070
elevator up and down emergence tower
psychologically sometimes we are

260
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:28,080
psychologically sometimes we are
 

261
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,070
psychologically sometimes we are
individuals that are

262
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:30,080
individuals that are
 

263
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,749
individuals that are
uh competing with other individuals and

264
00:04:31,749 --> 00:04:31,759
uh competing with other individuals and
 

265
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,030
uh competing with other individuals and
that that's where our mindset is and

266
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:33,040
that that's where our mindset is and
 

267
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,189
that that's where our mindset is and
then other times we get in this crazy

268
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:35,199
then other times we get in this crazy
 

269
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,030
then other times we get in this crazy
zone you know a protest or a sporting

270
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:37,040
zone you know a protest or a sporting
 

271
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,790
zone you know a protest or a sporting
event and you're just you know you're

272
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:38,800
event and you're just you know you're
 

273
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,150
event and you're just you know you're
just chanting and screaming and doing

274
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:40,160
just chanting and screaming and doing
 

275
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,670
just chanting and screaming and doing
the same hand motions with all these

276
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:41,680
the same hand motions with all these
 

277
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,830
the same hand motions with all these
other people and you feel like one you

278
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:43,840
other people and you feel like one you
 

279
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,270
other people and you feel like one you
feel like one you know and you sacrifice

280
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:45,280
feel like one you know and you sacrifice
 

281
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,230
feel like one you know and you sacrifice
yourself you know that's what you know

282
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:46,240
yourself you know that's what you know
 

283
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,590
yourself you know that's what you know
soldiers and so our brains can kind of

284
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:49,600
soldiers and so our brains can kind of
 

285
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,110
soldiers and so our brains can kind of
psychologically go up and down this

286
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:51,120
psychologically go up and down this
 

287
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,510
psychologically go up and down this
elevator in an interesting way

288
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:53,520
elevator in an interesting way
 

289
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,510
elevator in an interesting way
yeah i wonder how much of that is just a

290
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:55,520
yeah i wonder how much of that is just a
 

291
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,510
yeah i wonder how much of that is just a
narrative we tell ourselves maybe it's

292
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:57,520
narrative we tell ourselves maybe it's
 

293
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,110
narrative we tell ourselves maybe it's
we are just like an ant colony we're

294
00:04:59,110 --> 00:04:59,120
we are just like an ant colony we're
 

295
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,350
we are just like an ant colony we're
just collaborating always even in our

296
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:01,360
just collaborating always even in our
 

297
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,990
just collaborating always even in our
stories of individualism

298
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:04,000
stories of individualism
 

299
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,670
stories of individualism
of like the freedom of the individual

300
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:05,680
of like the freedom of the individual
 

301
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,350
of like the freedom of the individual
like this kind of

302
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:07,360
like this kind of
 

303
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,189
like this kind of
isolation

304
00:05:09,189 --> 00:05:09,199
isolation
 

305
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,270
isolation
alone man on an island kind of thing

306
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:11,280
alone man on an island kind of thing
 

307
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,189
alone man on an island kind of thing
we're actually all part of this giant

308
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:13,199
we're actually all part of this giant
 

309
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,510
we're actually all part of this giant
network of maybe one of the things that

310
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:15,520
network of maybe one of the things that
 

311
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,110
network of maybe one of the things that
makes humans who we are is probably

312
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:19,120
makes humans who we are is probably
 

313
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,390
makes humans who we are is probably
deeply

314
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:20,400
deeply
 

315
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,870
deeply
social the ability to maintain not just

316
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:22,880
social the ability to maintain not just
 

317
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,870
social the ability to maintain not just
a single human intelligence but like a

318
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:24,880
a single human intelligence but like a
 

319
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,749
a single human intelligence but like a
collective intelligence and so this

320
00:05:27,749 --> 00:05:27,759
collective intelligence and so this
 

321
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,909
collective intelligence and so this
feeling like individual is just because

322
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:29,919
feeling like individual is just because
 

323
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,350
feeling like individual is just because
we woke up at this level of the

324
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:31,360
we woke up at this level of the
 

325
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,950
we woke up at this level of the
hierarchy

326
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:32,960
hierarchy
 

327
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,310
hierarchy
so we make it special but we we very

328

this whole conversation i'm either going
to be doing a

statements that you've made so
 

343
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,510
statements that you've made so
you've written answers to uh a mailbag

344
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:53,520
you've written answers to uh a mailbag
 

345
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,870
you've written answers to uh a mailbag
of questions

346
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:54,880
of questions
 

347
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,230
of questions
the questions are amazing the ones

348
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:56,240
the questions are amazing the ones
 

349
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,830
the questions are amazing the ones
you've chosen and your answers are

350
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:57,840
you've chosen and your answers are
 

351
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,670
you've chosen and your answers are
amazing so on this topic of the big and

352
00:05:59,670 --> 00:05:59,680
amazing so on this topic of the big and
 

353
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,590
amazing so on this topic of the big and
the small somebody asked are we bigger

354
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:01,600
the small somebody asked are we bigger
 

355
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,270
the small somebody asked are we bigger
than we are small

356
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:03,280
than we are small
 

357
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,510
than we are small
or smaller than we are big who's asking

358
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:05,520
or smaller than we are big who's asking
 

359
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,830
or smaller than we are big who's asking
these questions this is really good

360
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:07,840
these questions this is really good
 

361
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,909
these questions this is really good
you have amazing fans okay uh so

362
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:11,919
you have amazing fans okay uh so
 

363
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,309
you have amazing fans okay uh so
where do we sit

364
00:06:14,309 --> 00:06:14,319
where do we sit
 

365
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,029
where do we sit
um at this level of the very small to

366
00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:17,039
um at this level of the very small to
 

367
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,309
um at this level of the very small to
the very big

368
00:06:18,309 --> 00:06:18,319
the very big
 

369
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,150
the very big
so are we bigger or are we small are we

370
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:20,160
so are we bigger or are we small are we
 

371
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,070
so are we bigger or are we small are we
bigger than we are small i think it

372
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:22,080
bigger than we are small i think it
 

373
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,230
bigger than we are small i think it
depends on what we're asking here so if

374
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:24,240
depends on what we're asking here so if
 

375
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,309
depends on what we're asking here so if
we're talking about the the the biggest

376
00:06:26,309 --> 00:06:26,319
we're talking about the the the biggest
 

377
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,749
we're talking about the the the biggest
thing that we

378
00:06:27,749 --> 00:06:27,759
thing that we
 

379
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,110
thing that we
kind of

380
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:29,120
kind of
 

381
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,909
kind of
can talk about without just imagining is

382
00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:31,919
can talk about without just imagining is
 

383
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,510
can talk about without just imagining is
the observable universe the hubble

384
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:33,520
the observable universe the hubble
 

385
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,590
the observable universe the hubble
sphere

386
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:35,600
sphere
 

387
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,550
sphere
and

388
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:36,560
and
 

389
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,390
and
that's about 10 to the 26th meters in

390
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:40,400
that's about 10 to the 26th meters in
 

391
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,590
that's about 10 to the 26th meters in
diameter

392
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:41,600
diameter
 

393
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,950
diameter
the smallest thing we talk about is a

394
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:42,960
the smallest thing we talk about is a
 

395
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,029
the smallest thing we talk about is a
planck length but you could argue that

396
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:45,039
planck length but you could argue that
 

397
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,189
planck length but you could argue that
that's kind of an imaginary thing but

398
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:47,199
that's kind of an imaginary thing but
 

399
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,749
that's kind of an imaginary thing but
that's 10 to the negative 35. now we're

400
00:06:49,749 --> 00:06:49,759
that's 10 to the negative 35. now we're
 

401
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,390
that's 10 to the negative 35. now we're
about conveniently about 10 to the 1.

402
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:52,400
about conveniently about 10 to the 1.
 

403
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,990
about conveniently about 10 to the 1.
not not quite 10 to the zero we're about

404
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:54,000
not not quite 10 to the zero we're about
 

405
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,110
not not quite 10 to the zero we're about
10 to the zero um meters long so we're

406
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:57,120
10 to the zero um meters long so we're
 

407
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,390
10 to the zero um meters long so we're
writing so it's easy because you can

408
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:58,400
writing so it's easy because you can
 

409
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,909
writing so it's easy because you can
just look and say okay well

410
00:06:59,909 --> 00:06:59,919
just look and say okay well
 

411
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,589
just look and say okay well
uh for example uh atoms are like 10 to

412
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:03,599
uh for example uh atoms are like 10 to
 

413
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,309
uh for example uh atoms are like 10 to
the negative 15 or 10 to the negative 16

414
00:07:06,309 --> 00:07:06,319
the negative 15 or 10 to the negative 16
 

415
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,390
the negative 15 or 10 to the negative 16
meters across right

416
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:08,400
meters across right
 

417
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,070
meters across right
if you go 10 to the 15th or 10 to the

418
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:10,080
if you go 10 to the 15th or 10 to the
 

419
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,230
if you go 10 to the 15th or 10 to the
16th which is right that's now so an

420
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:12,240
16th which is right that's now so an
 

421
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,309
16th which is right that's now so an
atom to us is us to this you get to like

422
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:14,319
atom to us is us to this you get to like
 

423
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,430
atom to us is us to this you get to like
nebulas

424
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:15,440
nebulas
 

425
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,029
nebulas
smaller than a galaxy and bigger than

426
00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:17,039
smaller than a galaxy and bigger than
 

427
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,390
smaller than a galaxy and bigger than
the biggest star

428
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:18,400
the biggest star
 

429
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,830
the biggest star
so we're right in between nebula and an

430
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:21,840
so we're right in between nebula and an
 

431
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,670
so we're right in between nebula and an
atom now if you want to go down to quark

432
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:23,680
atom now if you want to go down to quark
 

433
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,870
atom now if you want to go down to quark
level you might be able to get up to

434
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:24,880
level you might be able to get up to
 

435
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,230
level you might be able to get up to
galaxy level

436
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:26,240
galaxy level
 

437
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,350
galaxy level
um

438
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:27,360
um
 

439
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,629
um
when you go up to the observable

440
00:07:28,629 --> 00:07:28,639
when you go up to the observable
 

441
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,309
when you go up to the observable
universe you're getting down on the

442
00:07:30,309 --> 00:07:30,319
universe you're getting down on the
 

443
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,110
universe you're getting down on the
small side to things that we i think are

444
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:33,120
small side to things that we i think are
 

445
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,029
small side to things that we i think are
mostly theoretically

446
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:35,039
mostly theoretically
 

447
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,790
mostly theoretically
um imagining are there and and and

448
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:37,800
um imagining are there and and and
 

449
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,710
um imagining are there and and and
hypothesizing are there so i think

450
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:40,720
hypothesizing are there so i think
 

451
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,830
hypothesizing are there so i think
um

452
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:41,840
um
 

453
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,510
um
as far as real world objects that we

454
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:43,520
as far as real world objects that we
 

455
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,909
as far as real world objects that we
really know a lot about i would say we

456
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:45,919
really know a lot about i would say we
 

457
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,869
really know a lot about i would say we
are smaller than we are big uh but if

458
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:48,879
are smaller than we are big uh but if
 

459
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,230
are smaller than we are big uh but if
you want to go down to the plank length

460
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:50,240
you want to go down to the plank length
 

461
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,510
you want to go down to the plank length
we're very quickly we're bigger than we

462
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:51,520
we're very quickly we're bigger than we
 

463
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,950
we're very quickly we're bigger than we
are small if you're if you think about

464
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:52,960
are small if you're if you think about
 

465
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,990
are small if you're if you think about
strings

466
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:54,000
strings
 

467
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,390
strings
yeah string exactly with string theory

468
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:56,400
yeah string exactly with string theory
 

469
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,869
yeah string exactly with string theory
and so on that's interesting but i think

470
00:07:58,869 --> 00:07:58,879
and so on that's interesting but i think
 

471
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,869
and so on that's interesting but i think
like you answer no matter what we're

472
00:08:00,869 --> 00:08:00,879
like you answer no matter what we're
 

473
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,510
like you answer no matter what we're
kind of middle-ish yeah i mean

474
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:03,520
kind of middle-ish yeah i mean
 

475
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,430
kind of middle-ish yeah i mean
here's something cool if if human is a

476
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:05,440
here's something cool if if human is a
 

477
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,350
here's something cool if if human is a
neutrino and again neutrino the size

478
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:07,360
neutrino and again neutrino the size
 

479
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,710
neutrino and again neutrino the size
doesn't really make sense it's not

480
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:08,720
doesn't really make sense it's not
 

481
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,790
doesn't really make sense it's not
really a size but when we talk about

482
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:10,800
really a size but when we talk about
 

483
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,990
really a size but when we talk about
some of these neutrinos i mean if

484
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:12,000
some of these neutrinos i mean if
 

485
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,270
some of these neutrinos i mean if
neutrinos are human a proton is the sun

486
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:15,280
neutrinos are human a proton is the sun
 

487
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,550
neutrinos are human a proton is the sun
so that's like

488
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:16,560
so that's like
 

489
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,550
so that's like
i mean a proton is real small

490
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:18,560
i mean a proton is real small
 

491
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,550
i mean a proton is real small
like really small um

492
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:20,560
like really small um
 

493
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,230
like really small um
and uh

494
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:22,240
and uh
 

495
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,589
and uh
and so

496
00:08:23,589 --> 00:08:23,599
and so
 

497
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,589
and so
yeah the small gets like crazy small

498
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:25,599
yeah the small gets like crazy small
 

499
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,990
yeah the small gets like crazy small
very quickly

500
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:28,000
very quickly
 

501
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,309
very quickly
let's talk about aliens

502
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:30,319
let's talk about aliens
 

503
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,630
let's talk about aliens
we already mentioned it

504
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:32,640
we already mentioned it
 

505
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,990
we already mentioned it
let's start just by with the basic

00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:34,000
let's start just by with the basic
 

507
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,070
let's start just by with the basic
what's your intuition as of today this

508
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:36,080
what's your intuition as of today this
 

509
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,230
what's your intuition as of today this
is a thing that could change day by day

510
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:38,240
is a thing that could change day by day
 

511
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,230
is a thing that could change day by day
but how many alien civilizations out

512
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:40,240
but how many alien civilizations out
 

513
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,230
but how many alien civilizations out
there is it zero

514
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:42,240
there is it zero
 

515
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,909
there is it zero
is it

516
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:43,919
is it
 

517
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,949
is it
a handful is it almost endless like the

the you know the observable universe or
 

523
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,509
the you know the observable universe or
the universe is teeming with life

524
00:08:53,509 --> 00:08:53,519
the universe is teeming with life
 

525
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,190
the universe is teeming with life

529
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,910

um and so then if you go outside the

566
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:31,200
um and so then if you go outside the
 

567
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,269
um and so then if you go outside the
milky way that would turn into trillions

that's the that's the mean now what's

570
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:35,680
that's the that's the mean now what's
 

571
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,070
that's the that's the mean now what's
interesting is that there's a long tail

572
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:38,080
interesting is that there's a long tail
 

573
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,310
interesting is that there's a long tail
because they believe some of these

574
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:40,320
because they believe some of these

577
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,070
multipliers in the drake equation so for
example the

578
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:44,080
example the
 

579
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,990
example the
probability that life

580
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:46,000
probability that life
 

581
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,070

starts in the first place

582
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:48,080
starts in the first place
 

583
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,949
starts in the first place
they think that the uh the kind of range

584
00:09:50,949 --> 00:09:50,959
they think that the uh the kind of range
 

585
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,550
they think that the uh the kind of range
that we use

586
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:52,560
that we use
 

587
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,350
that we use
is for that variable or is way too small

588
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:55,360
is for that variable or is way too small
 

589
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,910
is for that variable or is way too small
and that's constraining our

590
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:57,920
and that's constraining our
 

591
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,430
and that's constraining our
possibilities and if you actually extend

592
00:09:59,430 --> 00:09:59,440
possibilities and if you actually extend
 

593
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,829
possibilities and if you actually extend
it to you know you know some some crazy

594
00:10:01,829 --> 00:10:01,839
it to you know you know some some crazy
 

595
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,990

they think should that that variable
 

599
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,670

should be uh
 

601
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,430

you get this long tail where

602
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:09,440
you get this long tail where
 

603
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,030
you get this long tail where
i forget the exact number but it's like

604
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:11,040
i forget the exact number but it's like
 

605
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,829
i forget the exact number but it's like
a third or a quarter of the total

606
00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:13,839
a third or a quarter of the total
 

607
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,470
a third or a quarter of the total
outcomes have us alone like so you know

608
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:16,480
outcomes have us alone like so you know
 

609
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,470
outcomes have us alone like so you know
i think it's like i think it's a a

610
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:18,480
i think it's like i think it's a a
 

611
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,310
i think it's like i think it's a a
sizable percentage has us as the only

life in the galaxy but you can keep

616
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:23,440
life in the galaxy but you can keep
 

617
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,110
life in the galaxy but you can keep
going and i think there's like you know

618
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:25,120
going and i think there's like you know
 

619
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,310
going and i think there's like you know
a non-zero like legitimate amount of

00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:28,320
a non-zero like legitimate amount of
 

621
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,230
a non-zero like legitimate amount of

outcomes there that have us as the only
 

623
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,790
outcomes there that have us as the only

624
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:32,800
life in the observable universe at all
 

625
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,430
life in the observable universe at all
is on earth i mean it seems incredibly

626
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:35,440
is on earth i mean it seems incredibly
 

627
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,030
is on earth i mean it seems incredibly
counter-intuitive it seems like you know

628
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:37,040
counter-intuitive it seems like you know
 

629
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,710
counter-intuitive it seems like you know
you mentioned that people think um

630
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:38,720
you mentioned that people think um
 

631
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,069
you mentioned that people think um
you're you know you must be an idiot

632
00:10:40,069 --> 00:10:40,079
you're you know you must be an idiot
 

633
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,069
you're you know you must be an idiot
because um you know if you picked up one

634
00:10:42,069 --> 00:10:42,079
because um you know if you picked up one
 

635
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:43,670
because um you know if you picked up one
grain of sand on the beach and examined

636
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:43,680
grain of sand on the beach and examined
 

637
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,870
grain of sand on the beach and examined
it and you found all these little things

638
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:44,880
it and you found all these little things
 

639
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,829
it and you found all these little things
on it

it's like saying well maybe this is the

642
00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:47,279
it's like saying well maybe this is the
 

643
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,190
it's like saying well maybe this is the
only one that has that and it's like

644
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:49,200
only one that has that and it's like
 

645
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,949
only one that has that and it's like
probably not they're probably

646
00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:50,959
probably not they're probably
 

647
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,069
probably not they're probably
most of the sand probably hear a lot of

most of the sand probably hear a lot of
 

649
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,350
most of the sand probably hear a lot of
the sand right

so and then the other hand we don't see

652
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:55,040
so and then the other hand we don't see
 

653
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,710
so and then the other hand we don't see
anything we don't see any evidence you

654
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:56,720
anything we don't see any evidence you
 

655
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,310
anything we don't see any evidence you
know which of course people would say

656
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:58,320
know which of course people would say
 

657
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,350
know which of course people would say
that the people who scoff at the concept

658
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:01,360
that the people who scoff at the concept
 

659
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,829
that the people who scoff at the concept
that we're potentially alone

660
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:03,839
that we're potentially alone
 

661
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,069
that we're potentially alone
um they say well of course there's lots

662
00:11:06,069 --> 00:11:06,079
um they say well of course there's lots
 

663
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,110
um they say well of course there's lots
of reasons we wouldn't have seen

664
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:07,120
of reasons we wouldn't have seen
 

665
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,910
of reasons we wouldn't have seen
anything and they can go list them

666
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:09,920
anything and they can go list them
 

667
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,230
anything and they can go list them
and they're very compelling but

668
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:12,240
and they're very compelling but
 

669
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,829
and they're very compelling but
we don't know and the truth is if there

670
00:11:13,829 --> 00:11:13,839
we don't know and the truth is if there
 

671
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,350
we don't know and the truth is if there
were if this were a freak thing i mean

672
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:15,360
were if this were a freak thing i mean
 

673
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,590
were if this were a freak thing i mean
we don't if this were a completely freak

674
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:17,600
we don't if this were a completely freak
 

675
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,350
we don't if this were a completely freak
thing that happened here whether it's

676
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:19,360
thing that happened here whether it's
 

677
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,870
thing that happened here whether it's
life at all or just getting to this

678
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:20,880
life at all or just getting to this
 

679
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,230
life at all or just getting to this
level intelligence

680
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:24,240

 

681
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,630

that species whoever it was would think

682
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:26,640
that species whoever it was would think
 

683
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,069
that species whoever it was would think
there must be lots of us out there and

684
00:11:28,069 --> 00:11:28,079
there must be lots of us out there and
 

685
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,350
there must be lots of us out there and
they'd be wrong

686
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:29,360
they'd be wrong
 

687
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,069
they'd be wrong
so

688
00:11:30,069 --> 00:11:30,079
so
 

689
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,269
so
just being again using the same

690
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:31,279
just being again using the same
 

691
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:32,870
just being again using the same
intuition that most people would use i'd

692
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:32,880
intuition that most people would use i'd
 

693
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,310
intuition that most people would use i'd
say there's probably lots of other

694
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:34,320
say there's probably lots of other
 

695
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,470
say there's probably lots of other
things out there yeah and you wrote a

696
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:36,480
things out there yeah and you wrote a
 

697
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,310
things out there yeah and you wrote a
great blog post about it but to me the

698
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:38,320
great blog post about it but to me the
 

699
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,230
great blog post about it but to me the
two interesting

700
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:40,240
two interesting
 

701
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,509
two interesting
reasons

702
00:11:41,509 --> 00:11:41,519
reasons
 

703
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,670
reasons
that uh we haven't been in contact i i

704
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:43,680
that uh we haven't been in contact i i
 

705
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,990
that uh we haven't been in contact i i
too have an intuition that the universe

706
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:46,000
too have an intuition that the universe
 

707
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,430
too have an intuition that the universe
is teaming with life

708
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:47,440
is teaming with life
 

709
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,509
is teaming with life
so one interesting is around the great

710
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:49,519
so one interesting is around the great
 

711
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:50,629
so one interesting is around the great
filter

712
00:11:50,629 --> 00:11:50,639
filter
 

713
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:53,190
filter
so we're either the grade filters either

714
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:53,200
so we're either the grade filters either
 

715
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,389
so we're either the grade filters either
behind us or in front of us so the

716
00:11:56,389 --> 00:11:56,399
behind us or in front of us so the
 

717
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:57,829
behind us or in front of us so the
reason that's interesting is you get to

718
00:11:57,829 --> 00:11:57,839
reason that's interesting is you get to
 

719
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,550
reason that's interesting is you get to
think about what kind of things

720
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:00,560
think about what kind of things
 

721
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,710
think about what kind of things
ensure or

722
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:02,720
ensure or
 

723
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,629
ensure or
ensure the survival of an intelligent

724
00:12:04,629 --> 00:12:04,639
ensure the survival of an intelligent
 

725
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,949
ensure the survival of an intelligent
civilization or lead to the destruction

726
00:12:06,949 --> 00:12:06,959
civilization or lead to the destruction
 

727
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,629
civilization or lead to the destruction
of intelligent civilization that's a

728
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:08,639
of intelligent civilization that's a
 

729
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,389
of intelligent civilization that's a
very pragmatic very important question

730
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:10,399
very pragmatic very important question
 

731
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,389
very pragmatic very important question
to always be asking and we'll talk about

732
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:12,399
to always be asking and we'll talk about
 

733
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,110
to always be asking and we'll talk about
some of those and then um the other one

734
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:15,120
some of those and then um the other one
 

735
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,790
some of those and then um the other one
is

736
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:16,800
is
 

737
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,550
is
i'm saddened by the possibility that

738
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:18,560
i'm saddened by the possibility that
 

739
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,389
i'm saddened by the possibility that
there could be aliens communicate with

740
00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:20,399
there could be aliens communicate with
 

741
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,870
there could be aliens communicate with
us all the time in fact they may have

742
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:22,880
us all the time in fact they may have
 

743
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,030
us all the time in fact they may have
visited

744
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:25,040
visited
 

745
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,269
visited
and we're just too dumb

746
00:12:27,269 --> 00:12:27,279
and we're just too dumb
 

747
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,470
and we're just too dumb
to hear it to see it like the

748
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:30,480
to hear it to see it like the
 

749
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,430
to hear it to see it like the
um

750
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:31,440
um
 

751
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,350
um
the idea that the kind of life that can

752
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:33,360
the idea that the kind of life that can
 

753
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,389
the idea that the kind of life that can
evolve

754
00:12:34,389 --> 00:12:34,399
evolve
 

755
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,069
evolve
is just the range of life that can

756
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:36,079
is just the range of life that can
 

757
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:39,269
is just the range of life that can
evolve is so large that our narrow view

758
00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:39,279
evolve is so large that our narrow view
 

759
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,350
evolve is so large that our narrow view
of what is life

760
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:41,360
of what is life
 

761
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,870
of what is life
and what is intelligent life is

762
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:42,880
and what is intelligent life is
 

763
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,030
and what is intelligent life is
preventing us from having communication

764
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:45,040
preventing us from having communication
 

765
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,949
preventing us from having communication
with them but that then they don't seem

766
00:12:46,949 --> 00:12:46,959
with them but that then they don't seem
 

767
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,190
with them but that then they don't seem
very smart because if they were trying

768
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:49,200
very smart because if they were trying
 

769
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,269
very smart because if they were trying
to communicate with us they would surely

770
00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:51,279
to communicate with us they would surely
 

771
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,430
to communicate with us they would surely
if they were super intelligent they

772
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:53,440
if they were super intelligent they
 

773
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,790
if they were super intelligent they
would be very

774
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:54,800
would be very
 

775
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,389
would be very
i'm sure if there's lots of life we're

776
00:12:56,389 --> 00:12:56,399
i'm sure if there's lots of life we're
 

777
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,710
i'm sure if there's lots of life we're
not that rare we're not some crazy weird

778
00:12:58,710 --> 00:12:58,720
not that rare we're not some crazy weird
 

779
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,470
not that rare we're not some crazy weird
species that hears and

780
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:00,480
species that hears and
 

781
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,150
species that hears and
you know has different kinds of ways of

782
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:02,160
you know has different kinds of ways of
 

783
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,030
you know has different kinds of ways of
of

784
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:03,040
of
 

785
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,590
of
perceiving signals so they would

786
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:05,600
perceiving signals so they would
 

787
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,030
perceiving signals so they would
probably be able to see you know if you

788
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:07,040
probably be able to see you know if you
 

789
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,230
probably be able to see you know if you
really wanted to communicate with an

790
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:08,240
really wanted to communicate with an
 

791
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,829
really wanted to communicate with an
earth-like species

792
00:13:09,829 --> 00:13:09,839
earth-like species
 

793
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,389
earth-like species
with a human-like species um you would

794
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:12,399
with a human-like species um you would
 

795
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,389
with a human-like species um you would
send out all kinds of things you'd send

796
00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:14,399
send out all kinds of things you'd send
 

797
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,069
send out all kinds of things you'd send
out you know radio

798
00:13:16,069 --> 00:13:16,079
out you know radio
 

799
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,389
out you know radio
radio waves and and you send out gravity

800
00:13:18,389 --> 00:13:18,399
radio waves and and you send out gravity
 

801
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,790
radio waves and and you send out gravity
waves and and lots of things so if

802
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:20,800
waves and and lots of things so if
 

803
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,230
waves and and lots of things so if
they're communicating in a way they're

804
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:22,240
they're communicating in a way they're
 

805
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,310
they're communicating in a way they're
trying to communicate with us and it's

806
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:24,320
trying to communicate with us and it's
 

807
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,509
trying to communicate with us and it's
just we're too dumb to perceive the

808
00:13:25,509 --> 00:13:25,519
just we're too dumb to perceive the
 

809
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,030
just we're too dumb to perceive the
signals it's like well they're not doing

810
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:27,040
signals it's like well they're not doing
 

811
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,310
signals it's like well they're not doing
a great job

812
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:28,320
a great job
 

813
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,509
a great job
of uh considering the primitive

814

species we might be so i i don't know i

816
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:33,680
species we might be so i i don't know i
 

817
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,269
species we might be so i i don't know i
think i think if a super intelligent

818
00:13:35,269 --> 00:13:35,279
think i think if a super intelligent
 

819
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,069
think i think if a super intelligent
species wanted to get in touch with us

820
00:13:38,069 --> 00:13:38,079
species wanted to get in touch with us
 

821
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:39,189
species wanted to get in touch with us
um

822
00:13:39,189 --> 00:13:39,199
um
 

823
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,189
um
uh and had the capability of i think

824
00:13:41,189 --> 00:13:41,199
uh and had the capability of i think
 

825
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:42,389
uh and had the capability of i think
probably

826
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:42,399
probably
 

827
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:43,430
probably
they would

828
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:43,440
they would
 

829
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,069
they would
well that

830
00:13:46,069 --> 00:13:46,079

 

831
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,470

they may be getting in touch with us

832
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:48,480
they may be getting in touch with us
 

833
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,750
they may be getting in touch with us
they're just getting in touch with the

834
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:49,760
they're just getting in touch with the
 

835
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,509
they're just getting in touch with the
thing that we humans are not

836
00:13:51,509 --> 00:13:51,519
thing that we humans are not
 

837
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:52,629
thing that we humans are not
understanding that they're getting in

838
00:13:52,629 --> 00:13:52,639
understanding that they're getting in
 

839
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,150
understanding that they're getting in
touch with us with that i guess that's

840
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:54,160
touch with us with that i guess that's
 

841
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,910
touch with us with that i guess that's
what i was trying to say is

842
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:55,920
what i was trying to say is
 

843
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,430
what i was trying to say is

00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:57,440
there could be something about earth
 

845
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,069
there could be something about earth
that's much more special than us humans

846
00:14:00,069 --> 00:14:00,079
that's much more special than us humans
 

847
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,670
that's much more special than us humans
like the nature of the intelligence

848
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:01,680
like the nature of the intelligence

00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,269
it's a whole different way to view
organisms and view life that could be

are just a tiny fingertip on top of that

of earth versus us humans that seem to
 

903
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,470

treat ourselves as super important
 

905
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,550
treat ourselves as super important
and we're missing the big picture i mean

906
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:00,560
and we're missing the big picture i mean
 

907
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,870
and we're missing the big picture i mean
it sounds crazy but

908
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:02,880
it sounds crazy but
 

909
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,550
it sounds crazy but
our understanding of what is intelligent

910
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:04,560
our understanding of what is intelligent
 

911
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,870
our understanding of what is intelligent
of what is life what is consciousness is

912
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:06,880
of what is life what is consciousness is
 

913
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,829
of what is life what is consciousness is
very limited and it seems to be

914
00:15:09,829 --> 00:15:09,839
very limited and it seems to be
 

915
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,069
very limited and it seems to be
and just being very suspicious it seems

916
00:15:12,069 --> 00:15:12,079
and just being very suspicious it seems
 

917
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:14,230
and just being very suspicious it seems
to be awfully human-centric

918
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:14,240
to be awfully human-centric
 

919
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,470
to be awfully human-centric
like this story it seems like the

920
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:16,480
like this story it seems like the
 

921
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,269
like this story it seems like the
progress of science is

922
00:15:19,269 --> 00:15:19,279
progress of science is
 

923
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:22,150
progress of science is
you know um constantly

924
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:22,160
you know um constantly
 

925
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,670
you know um constantly
putting humans down on the importance

926
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:25,680
putting humans down on the importance
 

927
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,310
putting humans down on the importance
like on the cosmic importance the

928
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:28,320
like on the cosmic importance the
 

929
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,030
like on the cosmic importance the
ranking of how big we are how important

930
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:31,040
ranking of how big we are how important
 

931
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:31,990
ranking of how big we are how important
we are

932
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:32,000
we are
 

933
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,430
we are
that that seems to be the more we

934
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:33,440
that that seems to be the more we
 

935
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,030
that that seems to be the more we
discover that's what's happening and i

936
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:35,040
discover that's what's happening and i
 

937
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,110
discover that's what's happening and i
think science is very young

938
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:37,120
think science is very young
 

939
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,189
think science is very young
and so i think eventually we might

940
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:39,199
and so i think eventually we might
 

941
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:40,629
and so i think eventually we might
figure out that there's something much

942
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:40,639
figure out that there's something much
 

943
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,470
figure out that there's something much
much bigger going on that humans are

944
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:42,480
much bigger going on that humans are
 

945
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,110
much bigger going on that humans are
just a curious little side effect of the

946
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:45,120
just a curious little side effect of the
 

947
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,910
just a curious little side effect of the
much bigger thing that's what i mean

948
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:47,920
much bigger thing that's what i mean
 

949
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,150
much bigger thing that's what i mean
that as i'm saying it just sounds insane

950
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:50,160
that as i'm saying it just sounds insane
 

951
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,790
that as i'm saying it just sounds insane
but well it just it sounds a little um

952
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:52,800
but well it just it sounds a little um
 

953
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,710
but well it just it sounds a little um
like religious it sounds like a

954
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:54,720
like religious it sounds like a
 

955
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,350
like religious it sounds like a
spiritual um

956
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:57,360
spiritual um
 

957
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,030
spiritual um
you know it gets to that realm where

958
00:15:59,030 --> 00:15:59,040
you know it gets to that realm where
 

959
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,949
you know it gets to that realm where
there's something that more than meets

960
00:16:00,949 --> 00:16:00,959
there's something that more than meets
 

961
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:01,910
there's something that more than meets
the eye

962
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:01,920
the eye
 

963
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,269
the eye
well

00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:16,720
i
 

981
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,629
i
i mean more like it's possible that

982
00:16:18,629 --> 00:16:18,639
i mean more like it's possible that
 

983
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:19,990
i mean more like it's possible that
collective intelligence is more

984
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:20,000
collective intelligence is more
 

985
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,990
collective intelligence is more
important than individual intelligence

986
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:22,000
important than individual intelligence
 

987
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,749
important than individual intelligence
right it's the ant colony what's the

988
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:23,759
right it's the ant colony what's the
 

989
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,590
right it's the ant colony what's the
primal organism is it the ant colony or

990
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:25,600
primal organism is it the ant colony or
 

991
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,710
primal organism is it the ant colony or
is it the ant

992
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:26,720
is it the ant
 

993
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,310
is it the ant
yeah i mean i mean humans just like you

994
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:28,320
yeah i mean i mean humans just like you
 

995
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,790

know any individual ant can't do [\h__\h]

996
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:30,800
know any individual ant can't do [\h__\h]
 

997
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,310
know any individual ant can't do [\h__\h]
but the colony can do make this

998
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:32,320
but the colony can do make this
 

999
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,310
but the colony can do make this
incredible structures and and has this

1000
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:34,320
incredible structures and and has this
 

1001
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,710
incredible structures and and has this
intelligence and we're exactly the same

1002
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:36,720
intelligence and we're exactly the same
 

1003
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,030
intelligence and we're exactly the same
i mean yeah you know you know the famous

incredible infrastructure that's in
place for that's for that quickly ages

1408
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:52,400
place for that's for that quickly ages
 

1409

place for that's for that quickly ages
the internet to you know the electricity

1410
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:54,240
the internet to you know the electricity
 

1411
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,350
the internet to you know the electricity
first of all that's just powering the

1412
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:55,360
first of all that's just powering the
 

1413
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,029
first of all that's just powering the
things you know how the h where the the

1414
00:22:57,029 --> 00:22:57,039
things you know how the h where the the
 

1415
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:58,310
things you know how the h where the the
amount of structures that have to be

1416
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:58,320
amount of structures that have to be
 

1417
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,390
amount of structures that have to be
created and for that electricity to be

1418
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:00,400
created and for that electricity to be
 

1419
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,990
created and for that electricity to be
there and then you've got the of course

1420
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:02,000
there and then you've got the of course
 

1421
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,190
there and then you've got the of course
the internet and then you have this

1422
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:03,200
the internet and then you have this
 

1423
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,510
the internet and then you have this
system um where delivery drivers and

1424
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:05,520
system um where delivery drivers and
 

1425
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,549
system um where delivery drivers and
they have they're running bikes that

1426
00:23:06,549 --> 00:23:06,559
they have they're running bikes that
 

1427
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:07,750
they have they're running bikes that
were made by someone else and they're

1428
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:07,760
were made by someone else and they're

again just like incredible gratitude
like ah uh yeah and the question is how

1572
00:25:25,909 --> 00:25:25,919
like ah uh yeah and the question is how
 

1573
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:27,510
like ah uh yeah and the question is how
resilient is this whole thing i mean

1574
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:27,520
resilient is this whole thing i mean
 

1575
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,470
resilient is this whole thing i mean
this is

1576
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:28,480
this is
 

1577
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,710
this is
another darker version of your question

1578
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:30,720
another darker version of your question
 

1579
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,750
another darker version of your question
is

1580
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:31,760
is
 

1581
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,310
is
if we keep all the material possessions

1582
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:34,320
if we keep all the material possessions
 

1583
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,630
if we keep all the material possessions
we have but we start

1584
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:36,640
we have but we start
 

1585
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,070
we have but we start
knocking out some percent of the

1586
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:38,080
knocking out some percent of the
 

1587
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,430

population
 

1589
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,350
population
how resilient is the system that we

1590
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:41,360
how resilient is the system that we
 

1591
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,830
how resilient is the system that we
built up or if we rely on other humans

1592
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:43,840
built up or if we rely on other humans

this number a million in mind as the

1612
00:26:03,909 --> 00:26:03,919
this number a million in mind as the
 

1613
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:05,830
this number a million in mind as the
order of ma right or magnitude of people

1614
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:05,840
order of ma right or magnitude of people
 

1615
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,830
order of ma right or magnitude of people
you need to

1616
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:07,840
you need to
 

1617
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,350
you need to
be on mars to truly be multi-planetary

1618
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:11,360
be on mars to truly be multi-planetary
 

1619
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,950
be on mars to truly be multi-planetary
yeah multi-planetary doesn't mean you

1620
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:12,960
yeah multi-planetary doesn't mean you
 

1621
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,669
yeah multi-planetary doesn't mean you
know

1622
00:26:13,669 --> 00:26:13,679
know
 

1623
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:14,950
know
uh

1624
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:14,960
uh
 

1625
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,149
uh
like

1626
00:26:16,149 --> 00:26:16,159
like
 

1627
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,549
like
when when neil armstrong you know goes

1628
00:26:18,549 --> 00:26:18,559
when when neil armstrong you know goes
 

1629
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:20,070
when when neil armstrong you know goes
to the moon that's they call it a great

1630
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:20,080
to the moon that's they call it a great
 

1631
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,470
to the moon that's they call it a great
leap for mankind yeah it's not a great

1632
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:22,480
leap for mankind yeah it's not a great
 

1633
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,870
leap for mankind yeah it's not a great
leap for anything it is a great

1634
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:24,880
leap for anything it is a great
 

1635
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,950
leap for anything it is a great
achievement for mankind and i always

1636
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:26,960
achievement for mankind and i always
 

1637
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,149
achievement for mankind and i always
like think about

1638
00:26:28,149 --> 00:26:28,159
like think about
 

1639
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:30,630
like think about
if the first fish to kind of

1640
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:30,640
if the first fish to kind of
 

1641
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,149
if the first fish to kind of
go on land just kind of went up and gave

1642
00:26:32,149 --> 00:26:32,159
go on land just kind of went up and gave
 

1643
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:33,669
go on land just kind of went up and gave
the shore high five and goes back into

1644
00:26:33,669 --> 00:26:33,679
the shore high five and goes back into
 

1645
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,190
the shore high five and goes back into
the water that's not a great leap for

1646
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:35,200
the water that's not a great leap for
 

1647
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,789
the water that's not a great leap for
life that's a great achievement for that

1648
00:26:36,789 --> 00:26:36,799
life that's a great achievement for that
 

1649
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:37,909
life that's a great achievement for that
fish and there should be a little statue

1650
00:26:37,909 --> 00:26:37,919
fish and there should be a little statue
 

1651
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:39,190
fish and there should be a little statue
of that fish and it's you know in the

1652
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:39,200
of that fish and it's you know in the
 

1653
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,029
of that fish and it's you know in the
water and everyone should celebrate the

1654
00:26:41,029 --> 00:26:41,039
water and everyone should celebrate the
 

1655
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,390
water and everyone should celebrate the
fish but it's um

1656
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:42,400
fish but it's um
 

1657
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,710
fish but it's um
but we talk about a great leap for life

1658
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:44,720
but we talk about a great leap for life
 

1659
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,870
but we talk about a great leap for life
it's permanent it's something that now

1660
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:46,880
it's permanent it's something that now
 

1661
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,029
it's permanent it's something that now
from now on this is how things are so

1662
00:26:49,029 --> 00:26:49,039
from now on this is how things are so
 

1663
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:50,390
from now on this is how things are so
this is part of why i get so excited

1664
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:50,400
this is part of why i get so excited
 

1665
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,390
this is part of why i get so excited
about mars by the way is because

1666
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:52,400
about mars by the way is because
 

1667
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,390
about mars by the way is because
you can count on one hand like the

1668
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:54,400
you can count on one hand like the
 

1669
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,029
you can count on one hand like the
number of great leaps that we've had you

1670
00:26:57,029 --> 00:26:57,039
number of great leaps that we've had you
 

1671
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:58,390
number of great leaps that we've had you
know like

1672
00:26:58,390 --> 00:26:58,400
know like
 

1673
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,789
know like
no life to life and single cell or

1674
00:27:00,789 --> 00:27:00,799
no life to life and single cell or
 

1675
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:03,430
no life to life and single cell or
simple cell to complex cell and

1676
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:03,440
simple cell to complex cell and
 

1677
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,830
simple cell to complex cell and
single cell organisms to animals to come

1678
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:05,840
single cell organisms to animals to come
 

1679
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,750
single cell organisms to animals to come
you know multi-cell animals um

1680
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:07,760
you know multi-cell animals um
 

1681
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,230
you know multi-cell animals um
and then ocean to land and then

1682
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:10,240
and then ocean to land and then
 

1683
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,990
and then ocean to land and then
one planet to two planets anyway

1684
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:12,000
one planet to two planets anyway
 

1685
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,230
one planet to two planets anyway
diversion but the point is that

1686
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:14,240
diversion but the point is that
 

1687
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,430
diversion but the point is that
um

1688
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:15,440
um
 

1689
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,590
um
we are officially that leap for all of

1690
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:17,600
we are officially that leap for all of
 

1691
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,750
we are officially that leap for all of
life you know has happened

1692
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:19,760
life you know has happened
 

1693
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,789
life you know has happened
once

1694
00:27:20,789 --> 00:27:20,799
once
 

1695
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,549
once
the ships could stop coming from earth

1696
00:27:22,549 --> 00:27:22,559
the ships could stop coming from earth
 

1697
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:23,430
the ships could stop coming from earth
because there's some horrible

1698
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:23,440
because there's some horrible
 

1699
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,710
because there's some horrible
catastrophic world war three and

1700
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:24,720
catastrophic world war three and
 

1701
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,070
catastrophic world war three and
everyone dies on earth and they're fine

1702
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:26,080
everyone dies on earth and they're fine
 

1703
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,630
everyone dies on earth and they're fine
and they can turn that certain x number

1704
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:28,640
and they can turn that certain x number
 

1705
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,630
and they can turn that certain x number
of people into seven billion

1706
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:30,640
of people into seven billion
 

1707
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,470
of people into seven billion
you know population that's thriving just

1708
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:32,480
you know population that's thriving just
 

1709
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,909
you know population that's thriving just
like earth they can build ships that can

1710
00:27:33,909 --> 00:27:33,919
like earth they can build ships that can
 

1711
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:35,190
like earth they can build ships that can
come back and recolonize earth because

1712
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:35,200
come back and recolonize earth because
 

1713
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,950
come back and recolonize earth because
now we are officially multi-planetary

1714
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:36,960
now we are officially multi-planetary
 

1715
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,870
now we are officially multi-planetary
where it's it's a self-sustaining he

1716
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:38,880
where it's it's a self-sustaining he
 

1717
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,470
where it's it's a self-sustaining he
says a million people is about what he

1718
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:40,480
says a million people is about what he
 

1719
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,909
says a million people is about what he
thinks now that might be a specialized

1720
00:27:41,909 --> 00:27:41,919
thinks now that might be a specialized
 

1721
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:43,990
thinks now that might be a specialized
group that's that's a very specifically

1722
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:44,000
group that's that's a very specifically
 

1723
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,029
group that's that's a very specifically
you know selected million that

1724
00:27:47,029 --> 00:27:47,039
you know selected million that
 

1725
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:47,430
you know selected million that
um has

1726
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:47,440
um has
 

1727
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,430
um has
very skilled million people not just

1728
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:49,440
very skilled million people not just
 

1729
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,669
very skilled million people not just
maybe the average million on earth but i

1730
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:51,679
maybe the average million on earth but i
 

1731
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:52,789
maybe the average million on earth but i
think it depends what you're talking

1732
00:27:52,789 --> 00:27:52,799
think it depends what you're talking
 

1733
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:54,389
think it depends what you're talking
about but i don't think you know so one

1734
00:27:54,389 --> 00:27:54,399
about but i don't think you know so one
 

1735
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:56,389
about but i don't think you know so one
million is one seven thousand one eight

1736
00:27:56,389 --> 00:27:56,399
million is one seven thousand one eight
 

1737
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,389
million is one seven thousand one eight
thousandth of the current population i

1738
00:27:58,389 --> 00:27:58,399
thousandth of the current population i
 

1739
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,950
thousandth of the current population i
think you need a very very very small

1740
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:00,960
think you need a very very very small
 

1741
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,310
think you need a very very very small
fraction of humans on earth to get by

1742
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:04,320
fraction of humans on earth to get by
 

1743
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,269
fraction of humans on earth to get by
obviously you're not going to have the

1744
00:28:05,269 --> 00:28:05,279
obviously you're not going to have the
 

1745
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,269
obviously you're not going to have the
same thriving civilization if you get to

1746
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:07,279
same thriving civilization if you get to
 

1747
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:09,430
same thriving civilization if you get to
a too small a number but it depends who

1748
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:09,440
a too small a number but it depends who
 

1749
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,029
a too small a number but it depends who
you're killing off i guess is part of

1750
00:28:11,029 --> 00:28:11,039
you're killing off i guess is part of
 

1751
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:12,789
you're killing off i guess is part of
the question yeah

1752
00:28:12,789 --> 00:28:12,799
the question yeah
 

1753
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:14,070
the question yeah
if you killed all half of the people

1754
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:14,080
if you killed all half of the people
 

1755
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,269
if you killed all half of the people
just randomly right now i think we'd be

1756
00:28:15,269 --> 00:28:15,279
just randomly right now i think we'd be
 

1757
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:17,190
just randomly right now i think we'd be
fine it would be obviously a great awful

1758
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:17,200
fine it would be obviously a great awful
 

1759
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,269
fine it would be obviously a great awful
tragedy um i think if you killed off

1760
00:28:19,269 --> 00:28:19,279
tragedy um i think if you killed off
 

1761
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:20,549
tragedy um i think if you killed off
three quarters of all people randomly

1762
00:28:20,549 --> 00:28:20,559
three quarters of all people randomly
 

1763
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:21,590
three quarters of all people randomly
just three out of every four people

1764
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:21,600
just three out of every four people
 

1765
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,190
just three out of every four people
dropped dead i think we'd have obviously

1766
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:23,200
dropped dead i think we'd have obviously
 

1767
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,789
dropped dead i think we'd have obviously
the stock market would crash uh we'd

1768
00:28:24,789 --> 00:28:24,799
the stock market would crash uh we'd
 

1769
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:28,549
the stock market would crash uh we'd
have a a rough patch but um i almost can

1770
00:28:28,549 --> 00:28:28,559
have a a rough patch but um i almost can
 

1771
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,149
have a a rough patch but um i almost can
assure you that the species would be

1772
00:28:30,149 --> 00:28:30,159
assure you that the species would be
 

1773
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:31,590
assure you that the species would be
fine well because the million number you

1774
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:31,600
fine well because the million number you
 

1775
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,750
fine well because the million number you
like you said it is specialized

1776
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:33,760
like you said it is specialized
 

1777
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,510
like you said it is specialized
so

1778
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:35,520
so
 

1779
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,669
so
i i think um

1780
00:28:37,669 --> 00:28:37,679
i i think um
 

1781
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:39,350
i i think um
because you have to do this you have to

1782
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:39,360
because you have to do this you have to
 

1783
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,830
because you have to do this you have to
basically do the iphone experiment like

1784
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:41,840
basically do the iphone experiment like
 

1785
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,590
basically do the iphone experiment like
literally you have to be able to

1786
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:43,600
literally you have to be able to
 

1787
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,149
literally you have to be able to
be able to manufacture computers yeah

1788
00:28:46,149 --> 00:28:46,159
be able to manufacture computers yeah
 

1789
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:47,510
be able to manufacture computers yeah
everything if you're going to have the

1790
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:47,520
everything if you're going to have the
 

1791
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,029
everything if you're going to have the
self-sustaining means you can you can

1792
00:28:49,029 --> 00:28:49,039
self-sustaining means you can you can
 

1793
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:50,950
self-sustaining means you can you can
you know any major important skill any

1794
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:50,960
you know any major important skill any
 

1795
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,310
you know any major important skill any
important piece of inverse you know kind

1796
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:52,320
important piece of inverse you know kind
 

1797
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,990
important piece of inverse you know kind
of infrastructure on earth can be built

1798
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:54,000
of infrastructure on earth can be built
 

1799
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,350
of infrastructure on earth can be built
there in this you know just as well

1800
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:57,360
there in this you know just as well
 

1801
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,430
there in this you know just as well
it'd be interesting to uh

1802
00:28:59,430 --> 00:28:59,440
it'd be interesting to uh
 

1803
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,750
it'd be interesting to uh
list out what are the important things

1804
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:01,760
list out what are the important things
 

1805
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,070
list out what are the important things
what are the important skills yeah i

1806
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:04,080
what are the important skills yeah i
 

1807
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,230
what are the important skills yeah i
mean if you have to feed everyone so you

1808
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:06,240
mean if you have to feed everyone so you
 

1809
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,789
mean if you have to feed everyone so you
know mass farming things like that um

1810
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:08,799
know mass farming things like that um
 

1811
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,470
know mass farming things like that um
you have to um

1812
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:10,480
you have to um
 

1813
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,070
you have to um
you have to you have mining these

1814
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:12,080
you have to you have mining these
 

1815
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,269
you have to you have mining these
questions it's like

1816
00:29:13,269 --> 00:29:13,279
questions it's like
 

1817
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,590
questions it's like
the materials might be i don't know i

1818
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:15,600
the materials might be i don't know i
 

1819
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,110
the materials might be i don't know i
don't know five mile two miles

1820
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:17,120
don't know five mile two miles
 

1821
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,470
don't know five mile two miles
underground i don't know with the actual

1822
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:18,480
underground i don't know with the actual
 

1823
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,310
underground i don't know with the actual
but like

1824
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:20,320
but like
 

1825
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,669
but like
it's amazing to me just that these

1826
00:29:21,669 --> 00:29:21,679
it's amazing to me just that these
 

1827
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:22,950
it's amazing to me just that these
things got built in the first place and

1828
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:22,960
things got built in the first place and
 

1829
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,470
things got built in the first place and
you know they never got no one built the

1830
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:24,480
you know they never got no one built the
 

1831
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,950
you know they never got no one built the
first the mine that we're getting uh

1832
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:26,960
first the mine that we're getting uh
 

1833
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,710
first the mine that we're getting uh
stuff for the iphone for probably wasn't

1834
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:28,720
stuff for the iphone for probably wasn't
 

1835
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,470
stuff for the iphone for probably wasn't
built for the iphone you know

1836
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:30,480
built for the iphone you know
 

1837
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,630
built for the iphone you know
or in general early mining you know was

1838
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:32,640
or in general early mining you know was
 

1839
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,230
or in general early mining you know was
for you know i think obviously i assume

1840
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:34,240
for you know i think obviously i assume
 

1841
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,669
for you know i think obviously i assume
the industrial revolution when we

1842
00:29:35,669 --> 00:29:35,679
the industrial revolution when we
 

1843
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:37,590
the industrial revolution when we
realized oh fossil fuels we want to

1844
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:37,600
realized oh fossil fuels we want to
 

1845
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,990
realized oh fossil fuels we want to
extract this magical energy source i

1846
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:40,000
extract this magical energy source i
 

1847
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,990
extract this magical energy source i
assume that like manny took a huge leap

1848
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:42,000
assume that like manny took a huge leap
 

1849
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,269
assume that like manny took a huge leap
without knowing very much about this i

1850
00:29:43,269 --> 00:29:43,279
without knowing very much about this i
 

1851
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:44,389
without knowing very much about this i
think you know you're gonna need you

1852
00:29:44,389 --> 00:29:44,399
think you know you're gonna need you
 

1853
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:45,190
think you know you're gonna need you
need

1854
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:45,200
need
 

1855
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,870
need
mining you're gonna need like heart a

1856
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:46,880
mining you're gonna need like heart a
 

1857
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,549
mining you're gonna need like heart a
lot of electrical engineers if you're

1858
00:29:48,549 --> 00:29:48,559
lot of electrical engineers if you're
 

1859
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:49,990
lot of electrical engineers if you're
gonna have a civilization like ours and

1860
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:50,000
gonna have a civilization like ours and
 

1861
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,350
gonna have a civilization like ours and
of course you could have oil and

1862
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:51,360
of course you could have oil and
 

1863
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,190
of course you could have oil and
lanterns we could go way back but if

1864
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:53,200
lanterns we could go way back but if
 

1865
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,110
lanterns we could go way back but if
you're trying to build our today thing

1866
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:55,120
you're trying to build our today thing
 

1867
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,389
you're trying to build our today thing
you're gonna need

1868
00:29:56,389 --> 00:29:56,399
you're gonna need
 

1869
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,310
you're gonna need
uh you know energy and electricity and

1870
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:58,320
uh you know energy and electricity and
 

1871
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,470
uh you know energy and electricity and
then and mines that can bring materials

1872
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:00,480
then and mines that can bring materials
 

1873
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,549
then and mines that can bring materials
and then you're gonna need a ton of

1874
00:30:02,549 --> 00:30:02,559
and then you're gonna need a ton of
 

1875
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:04,389
and then you're gonna need a ton of
plumbing and everything that entails

1876
00:30:04,389 --> 00:30:04,399
plumbing and everything that entails
 

1877
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:05,190
plumbing and everything that entails
yeah

1878
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:05,200
yeah
 

1879
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,710
yeah
and like i said food but also the

1880
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:06,720
and like i said food but also the
 

1881
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,549
and like i said food but also the
manufacturer so like turning raw

1882
00:30:08,549 --> 00:30:08,559
manufacturer so like turning raw
 

1883
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,630
manufacturer so like turning raw
materials into something useful yeah

1884
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:10,640
materials into something useful yeah
 

1885
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,029
materials into something useful yeah
that whole thing like factories

1886
00:30:13,029 --> 00:30:13,039
that whole thing like factories
 

1887
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:15,510
that whole thing like factories
some supply chain transportation

1888
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:15,520
some supply chain transportation
 

1889
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,269
some supply chain transportation
right you know i mean you think about

1890
00:30:17,269 --> 00:30:17,279
right you know i mean you think about
 

1891
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:18,549
right you know i mean you think about
when we talk about world hunger one of

1892
00:30:18,549 --> 00:30:18,559
when we talk about world hunger one of
 

1893
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:20,310
when we talk about world hunger one of
the major problems is

1894
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:20,320
the major problems is
 

1895
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,830
the major problems is
you know there's plenty of food and by

1896
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:21,840
you know there's plenty of food and by
 

1897
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,190
you know there's plenty of food and by
the time it arrives most of it's gone

1898
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:23,200
the time it arrives most of it's gone
 

1899
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,430
the time it arrives most of it's gone
bad in the truck you know in in a kind

1900
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:25,440
bad in the truck you know in in a kind
 

1901
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,909
bad in the truck you know in in a kind
of an impoverished place so it's like

1902
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:27,919
of an impoverished place so it's like
 

1903
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:29,269
of an impoverished place so it's like
you know we take again we take it so for

1904
00:30:29,269 --> 00:30:29,279
you know we take again we take it so for
 

1905
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:31,029
you know we take again we take it so for
granted all the food in the in the

1906
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:31,039
granted all the food in the in the
 

1907
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:34,470
granted all the food in the in the
supermarket is fresh it's all there and

1908
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:34,480
supermarket is fresh it's all there and
 

1909
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,510
supermarket is fresh it's all there and
which always stresses me if i were

1910
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:35,520
which always stresses me if i were
 

1911
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,870
which always stresses me if i were
running a supermarket i would always be

1912
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:36,880
running a supermarket i would always be
 

1913
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,110
running a supermarket i would always be
so like miserable about like

1914
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:39,120
so like miserable about like
 

1915
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,830
so like miserable about like
things going bad on the shelves um or if

1916
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:41,840
things going bad on the shelves um or if
 

1917
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,870
things going bad on the shelves um or if
you don't have enough that's not good

1918
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:42,880
you don't have enough that's not good
 

1919
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,990
you don't have enough that's not good
but if you have too much it goes bad

1920
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:44,000
but if you have too much it goes bad
 

1921
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,029
but if you have too much it goes bad
anyway of course there would be

1922
00:30:45,029 --> 00:30:45,039

think about the 1500s
when it was suddenly like a race to like

you know colonize or capture or land or
 

2001
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:02,070
you know colonize or capture or land or
discover new land that hasn't been you

discover new land that hasn't been you
 

2003
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,509
discover new land that hasn't been you
know so it was like this this new

know so it was like this this new
 

2005
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:04,950
know so it was like this this new
frontiers and there's not really you

2006
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:04,960
frontiers and there's not really you
 

2007
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,269
frontiers and there's not really you
know the land is not you know the thing

2008
00:32:07,269 --> 00:32:07,279
know the land is not you know the thing
 

2009
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:09,029

about crimea was like this huge thing

2010
00:32:09,029 --> 00:32:09,039
about crimea was like this huge thing
 

2011

00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,630
because this tiny peninsula switched
that's how like

2014
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:12,640
that's how like
 

2015
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,830
that's how like
optimized everything has become

2016
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:13,840

know territory funding for naming things

2022
00:32:20,389 --> 00:32:20,399
know territory funding for naming things
 

2023
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:21,350
know territory funding for naming things
and you know

2024
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:21,360
and you know
 

2025
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,230
and you know
um

2026
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:22,240
um
 

2027
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,149
um
and it's a chance for new kind of

2028
00:32:24,149 --> 00:32:24,159
and it's a chance for new kind of
 

2029
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:26,070
and it's a chance for new kind of
governments maybe or maybe it's just the

2030
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:26,080
governments maybe or maybe it's just the
 

2031
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,509
governments maybe or maybe it's just the
colonies of these governments so we

2032
00:32:27,509 --> 00:32:27,519
colonies of these governments so we
 

2033
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:28,789
colonies of these governments so we
don't get that opportunity i think it'd

2034
00:32:28,789 --> 00:32:28,799
don't get that opportunity i think it'd
 

2035
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,230
don't get that opportunity i think it'd
be cool if there's new countries being

2036
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:30,240
be cool if there's new countries being
 

2037
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,990
be cool if there's new countries being
you know totally new experiments yeah

2038
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:32,000
you know totally new experiments yeah
 

2039
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,750
you know totally new experiments yeah
and that's fascinating because elon

2040
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:33,760
and that's fascinating because elon
 

2041
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,750
and that's fascinating because elon
talks exactly about that and i i believe

2042
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:35,760
talks exactly about that and i i believe
 

2043
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,389
talks exactly about that and i i believe
that very much like that should be

2044
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:38,399
that very much like that should be
 

2045
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,630
that very much like that should be
like from from the start they should

2046
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:40,640
like from from the start they should
 

2047
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,470
like from from the start they should
determine their own

2048
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:42,480
determine their own
 

2049
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,470
determine their own
sovereignty like they

2050
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:44,480
sovereignty like they
 

2051
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,149
sovereignty like they
they should determine their own thing

2052
00:32:46,149 --> 00:32:46,159
they should determine their own thing
 

2053
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:49,269
they should determine their own thing
there was one modern democracy in the

2054
00:32:49,269 --> 00:32:49,279
there was one modern democracy in the
 

2055
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:51,190
there was one modern democracy in the
late 1700s the u.s i mean it was the

2056
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:51,200
late 1700s the u.s i mean it was the
 

2057
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,230
late 1700s the u.s i mean it was the
only

2058
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:52,240
only
 

2059
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,310
only
modern democracy and now

2060
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:54,320
modern democracy and now
 

2061
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,509
modern democracy and now
of course that's there's there's

2062
00:32:55,509 --> 00:32:55,519
of course that's there's there's
 

2063
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:57,669
of course that's there's there's
hundreds or doesn't many dozens but i

2064
00:32:57,669 --> 00:32:57,679
hundreds or doesn't many dozens but i
 

2065
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,110
hundreds or doesn't many dozens but i
think part of the reason that was able

2066
00:32:59,110 --> 00:32:59,120
think part of the reason that was able
 

2067
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,310
think part of the reason that was able
to start i mean it's not the people

2068
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:00,320
to start i mean it's not the people
 

2069
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,830
to start i mean it's not the people
didn't have the idea people had the idea

2070
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:01,840
didn't have the idea people had the idea
 

2071
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,909
didn't have the idea people had the idea
it was that it was uh they had of clean

2072
00:33:03,909 --> 00:33:03,919
it was that it was uh they had of clean
 

2073
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:05,430
it was that it was uh they had of clean
slate new place

2074
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:05,440
slate new place
 

2075
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,549
slate new place
you know and they suddenly were you know

2076
00:33:06,549 --> 00:33:06,559
you know and they suddenly were you know
 

2077
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:07,990
you know and they suddenly were you know
so i think it's it would be a great

2078
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:08,000
so i think it's it would be a great
 

2079
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,389
so i think it's it would be a great
opportunity to have there's a lot of

2080
00:33:10,389 --> 00:33:10,399

and it makes us somehow like thinking
about civilization on mars is um

2134
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:00,320
about civilization on mars is um
 

2135
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,990
about civilization on mars is um
helping us think about the civilization

2136
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:02,000

00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:11,040
that goes to mars
 

2145
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,589
that goes to mars
the goal is in this decade do you think

2146
00:34:13,589 --> 00:34:13,599
the goal is in this decade do you think
 

2147
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:15,430
the goal is in this decade do you think
uh that's actually gonna be achieved i

an argument um this is great that the

2154
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:22,800
an argument um this is great that the
 

2155
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,470
an argument um this is great that the
neil armstrong of mars whoever he or she

2156
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:24,480
neil armstrong of mars whoever he or she
 

2157
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,629
neil armstrong of mars whoever he or she
may be will set foot

2158
00:34:26,629 --> 00:34:26,639
may be will set foot
 

2159
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,470
may be will set foot
by the end of 2030.

2160
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:28,480
by the end of 2030.
 

2161
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,230
by the end of 2030.
now this was probably 2018 when i had

2162
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:30,240
now this was probably 2018 when i had
 

2163
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,389
now this was probably 2018 when i had
this argument so like what a human has

2164
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:32,399
this argument so like what a human has
 

2165
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:34,869
this argument so like what a human has
to touch mars by 20 and by the end of

2166
00:34:34,869 --> 00:34:34,879
to touch mars by 20 and by the end of
 

2167
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:37,990
to touch mars by 20 and by the end of
30. oh by the year 30 yeah by january

2168
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:38,000
30. oh by the year 30 yeah by january
 

2169
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,389
30. oh by the year 30 yeah by january
1st 2031. yeah so um did you agree on

2170
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:42,399
1st 2031. yeah so um did you agree on
 

2171
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:44,790
1st 2031. yeah so um did you agree on
the time zone or whatever no no yeah

2172
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:44,800
the time zone or whatever no no yeah
 

2173
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,149
the time zone or whatever no no yeah
it's coming on that exact day that's

2174
00:34:46,149 --> 00:34:46,159
it's coming on that exact day that's
 

2175
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:48,710
it's coming on that exact day that's
going to be really stressful but um

2176
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:48,720
going to be really stressful but um
 

2177
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,909
going to be really stressful but um
but anyway i i think that there will be

2178
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:51,919
but anyway i i think that there will be
 

2179
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:54,550
but anyway i i think that there will be
that was 2018 i was more confident then

2180
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:54,560
that was 2018 i was more confident then
 

2181
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,909
that was 2018 i was more confident then
um i think it's going to be around this

2182
00:34:55,909 --> 00:34:55,919
um i think it's going to be around this
 

2183
00:34:55,919 --> 00:34:58,069
um i think it's going to be around this
time i mean i still won the general bet

2184
00:34:58,069 --> 00:34:58,079
time i mean i still won the general bet
 

2185
00:34:58,079 --> 00:34:59,670
time i mean i still won the general bet
because his point was you are crazy this

2186
00:34:59,670 --> 00:34:59,680
because his point was you are crazy this
 

2187
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,950
because his point was you are crazy this
is not going to happen in our lifetimes

2188
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:00,960
is not going to happen in our lifetimes
 

2189
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,790
is not going to happen in our lifetimes
or not for many many decades and i said

2190
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:02,800
or not for many many decades and i said
 

2191
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,150
or not for many many decades and i said
you're wrong you don't know what's going

2192
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:04,160
you're wrong you don't know what's going
 

2193
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,710
you're wrong you don't know what's going
on in spacex i think if the world

2194
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:06,720
on in spacex i think if the world
 

2195
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,069
on in spacex i think if the world
depended on it

2196
00:35:08,069 --> 00:35:08,079
depended on it
 

2197
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:10,390
depended on it
i think probably spacex could probably i

2198
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:10,400
i think probably spacex could probably i
 

2199
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,390
i think probably spacex could probably i
mean i don't know this but

2200
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:12,400
mean i don't know this but
 

2201
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,870
mean i don't know this but
i think the tech is almost there like i

2202
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:14,880
i think the tech is almost there like i
 

2203
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,030
i think the tech is almost there like i
don't think of course it's it's delayed

2204
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:17,040
don't think of course it's it's delayed
 

2205
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,630
don't think of course it's it's delayed
many years by safety so they first want

2206
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:18,640
many years by safety so they first want
 

2207
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,230
many years by safety so they first want
to send a ship you know around mars and

2208
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:20,240
to send a ship you know around mars and
 

2209
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,910
to send a ship you know around mars and
they want to land a cargo ship on mars

2210
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:21,920
they want to land a cargo ship on mars
 

2211
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,430
they want to land a cargo ship on mars
and there's the moon on the way too yeah

2212
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:23,440
and there's the moon on the way too yeah
 

2213
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,910
and there's the moon on the way too yeah
there's there's but i think the moon

2214
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:25,920
there's there's but i think the moon
 

2215
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,550
there's there's but i think the moon
a decade before seemed like magical tech

2216
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:28,560
a decade before seemed like magical tech
 

2217
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,870
a decade before seemed like magical tech
that we that humans didn't have this is

2218
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:30,880
that we that humans didn't have this is
 

2219
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,950
that we that humans didn't have this is
like no we we can

2220
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:32,960
like no we we can
 

2221
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,870
like no we we can
it's it's it is it's totally conceivable

2222
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:34,880
it's it's it is it's totally conceivable
 

2223
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,510
it's it's it is it's totally conceivable
that this you've seen starship like it's

2224
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:37,520
that this you've seen starship like it's
 

2225
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,630
that this you've seen starship like it's
um

2226
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:38,640
um
 

2227
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,910
um
it is a

2228
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:39,920
it is a
 

2229
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,829
it is a
interplanetary colonial or

2230
00:35:41,829 --> 00:35:41,839
interplanetary colonial or
 

2231
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:43,750
interplanetary colonial or
interplanetary transport like system

2232
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:43,760
interplanetary transport like system
 

2233
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,190
interplanetary transport like system
that's what they used to call it

2234
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:45,200
that's what they used to call it
 

2235
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,510
that's what they used to call it
the spacex the way they do it is every

2236
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:47,520
the spacex the way they do it is every
 

2237
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,870
the spacex the way they do it is every
time they do a launch

2238
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:48,880
time they do a launch
 

2239
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,790
time they do a launch
something fails usually you know uh when

2240
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:50,800
something fails usually you know uh when
 

2241
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,190
something fails usually you know uh when
they're testing and they learn a

2242
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:53,200
they're testing and they learn a
 

2243
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,190
they're testing and they learn a
thousand things the amount of data they

2244
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:55,200
thousand things the amount of data they
 

2245
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,950
thousand things the amount of data they
get and they improve so each one has is

2246
00:35:58,950 --> 00:35:58,960
get and they improve so each one has is
 

2247
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,069
get and they improve so each one has is
you know it's like they've moved up like

2248
00:36:00,069 --> 00:36:00,079
you know it's like they've moved up like
 

2249
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:02,870
you know it's like they've moved up like
eight generations in each one anyway so

2250
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:02,880
eight generations in each one anyway so
 

2251
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,310
eight generations in each one anyway so
it's not inconceivable that pretty soon

2252
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:04,320
it's not inconceivable that pretty soon
 

2253
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,230
it's not inconceivable that pretty soon
they could send a starship to mars and

2254
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:06,240
they could send a starship to mars and
 

2255
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,470
they could send a starship to mars and
land it uh there's just no good reason i

2256
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:08,480
land it uh there's just no good reason i
 

2257
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,670
land it uh there's just no good reason i
don't think that they couldn't do that

2258
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:09,680
don't think that they couldn't do that
 

2259
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,030
don't think that they couldn't do that
and so if they could do that they could

2260
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:11,040
and so if they could do that they could
 

2261
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,109
and so if they could do that they could
in theory send a person to mars pretty

2262
00:36:13,109 --> 00:36:13,119
in theory send a person to mars pretty
 

2263
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:15,270
in theory send a person to mars pretty
soon now taking off from mars and coming

2264
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:15,280
soon now taking off from mars and coming
 

2265
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,510
soon now taking off from mars and coming
back again i think i don't think anyone

2266
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:17,520
back again i think i don't think anyone
 

2267
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,270
back again i think i don't think anyone
wants to be on that voyage today because

2268
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:19,280
wants to be on that voyage today because
 

2269
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,030
wants to be on that voyage today because
there's just you know there's still it's

2270
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:21,040
there's just you know there's still it's
 

2271
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,030
there's just you know there's still it's
still amateur hour here i mean getting

2272
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:23,040
still amateur hour here i mean getting
 

2273
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,470
still amateur hour here i mean getting
that perfect

2274
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:24,480
that perfect
 

2275
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,910
that perfect
i don't think we're too far away now the

2276
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:25,920
i don't think we're too far away now the
 

2277
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,109
i don't think we're too far away now the
question is

2278
00:36:27,109 --> 00:36:27,119
question is
 

2279
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:29,030
question is
so every so every 26

2280
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:29,040
so every so every 26
 

2281
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,750
so every so every 26
months earth laps mars right it's like

2282
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:31,760
months earth laps mars right it's like
 

2283
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,310
months earth laps mars right it's like
the sinocidal soil or orbit or whatever

2284
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:34,320
the sinocidal soil or orbit or whatever
 

2285
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,030
the sinocidal soil or orbit or whatever
it's called the period 26 months

2286
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:37,040
it's called the period 26 months
 

2287
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,109
it's called the period 26 months
so it's right now like in the evens like

2288
00:36:39,109 --> 00:36:39,119
so it's right now like in the evens like
 

2289
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:41,750
so it's right now like in the evens like
2022 is gonna have one of these 20 20

2290
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:41,760
2022 is gonna have one of these 20 20
 

2291
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,069
2022 is gonna have one of these 20 20
late 2024 so people could this was the

2292
00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:44,079
late 2024 so people could this was the
 

2293
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:46,069
late 2024 so people could this was the
earliest estimate i heard elon said

2294
00:36:46,069 --> 00:36:46,079
earliest estimate i heard elon said
 

2295
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:48,710
earliest estimate i heard elon said
maybe we can send people to mars in 2024

2296
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:48,720
maybe we can send people to mars in 2024
 

2297
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,589
maybe we can send people to mars in 2024
you know to land in 2020 early 2025.

2298
00:36:51,589 --> 00:36:51,599
you know to land in 2020 early 2025.
 

2299
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:53,030
you know to land in 2020 early 2025.
that is not going to happen because that

2300
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:53,040
that is not going to happen because that
 

2301
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,349
that is not going to happen because that
included 2022 sending a cargo ship to

2302
00:36:55,349 --> 00:36:55,359
included 2022 sending a cargo ship to
 

2303
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:58,550
included 2022 sending a cargo ship to
mars uh maybe even a one in 2020 and so

2304
00:36:58,550 --> 00:36:58,560
mars uh maybe even a one in 2020 and so
 

2305
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,510
mars uh maybe even a one in 2020 and so
i think they're not quite on that

2306
00:36:59,510 --> 00:36:59,520
i think they're not quite on that
 

2307
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,630
i think they're not quite on that
schedule but to win my bet uh 2027 i

2308
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:02,640
schedule but to win my bet uh 2027 i
 

2309
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,390
schedule but to win my bet uh 2027 i
have a chance in 2029 i have another

2310
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:04,400
have a chance in 2029 i have another
 

2311
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,230
have a chance in 2029 i have another
chance nice we're not very good at like

2312
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:06,240
chance nice we're not very good at like
 

2313
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,510
chance nice we're not very good at like
backing up and seeing the big picture

2314
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:07,520
backing up and seeing the big picture
 

2315
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,710
backing up and seeing the big picture
we're very distracted by what's going on

2316
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:08,720
we're very distracted by what's going on
 

2317
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,550
we're very distracted by what's going on
today and what's what we can believe

2318
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:10,560
today and what's what we can believe
 

2319
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,750
today and what's what we can believe
because it's happening in front of our

2320
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:11,760
because it's happening in front of our
 

2321
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,550
because it's happening in front of our
face there's no way that humans gonna be

2322
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:14,560
face there's no way that humans gonna be
 

2323
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,990
face there's no way that humans gonna be
landing on mars and it's not gonna be

2324
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:16,000
landing on mars and it's not gonna be
 

2325
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,470
landing on mars and it's not gonna be
the only thing everyone is talking about

2326
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:18,480
the only thing everyone is talking about
 

2327
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,670
the only thing everyone is talking about
right i mean it's gonna it's it's gonna

2328
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:19,680
right i mean it's gonna it's it's gonna
 

2329
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,190
right i mean it's gonna it's it's gonna
be the moon landing but even bigger deal

2330
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:21,200
be the moon landing but even bigger deal
 

2331
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,430
be the moon landing but even bigger deal
going to another planet right and and

2332
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:23,440
going to another planet right and and
 

2333
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,430
going to another planet right and and
for to start a colony not just again

2334
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:25,440
for to start a colony not just again
 

2335
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,030
for to start a colony not just again
high five and come back

2336
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:27,040
high five and come back
 

2337
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,030
high five and come back
so this is like

2338
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:29,040
so this is like
 

2339
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,510
so this is like
the 2020s maybe the 2030s

2340
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:31,520
the 2020s maybe the 2030s
 

2341
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,190
the 2020s maybe the 2030s
is gonna be the new 1960s we're gonna

2342
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:33,200
is gonna be the new 1960s we're gonna
 

2343
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,030
is gonna be the new 1960s we're gonna
have a space decade i'm so excited about

2344
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:35,040
have a space decade i'm so excited about
 

2345
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,630
have a space decade i'm so excited about
it yeah uh and it's again it's one of

2346
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:36,640
it yeah uh and it's again it's one of
 

2347
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,910
it yeah uh and it's again it's one of
the great leaps for all of life

2348
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:37,920
the great leaps for all of life
 

2349
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,589
the great leaps for all of life
happening in our lifetimes like that's

2350
00:37:39,589 --> 00:37:39,599
happening in our lifetimes like that's
 

2351
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:41,589
happening in our lifetimes like that's
wild to paint

2352
00:37:41,589 --> 00:37:41,599
wild to paint
 

2353
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:43,910
wild to paint
a slightly cynical possibility which i

2354
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:43,920
a slightly cynical possibility which i
 

2355
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,069
a slightly cynical possibility which i
don't see happening

2356
00:37:46,069 --> 00:37:46,079
don't see happening
 

2357
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:47,510
don't see happening
but i just want to put sort of value

2358
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:47,520
but i just want to put sort of value
 

2359
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,109
but i just want to put sort of value
into leadership

2360
00:37:49,109 --> 00:37:49,119
into leadership
 

2361
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:50,790
into leadership
i think um

2362
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:50,800
i think um
 

2363
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,390
i think um
it wasn't obvious that the moon landing

2364
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:52,400
it wasn't obvious that the moon landing
 

2365
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,990
it wasn't obvious that the moon landing
would be so exciting for all of human

2366
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:54,000
would be so exciting for all of human
 

2367
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,829
would be so exciting for all of human
civilization some of that have to do

2368
00:37:55,829 --> 00:37:55,839
civilization some of that have to do
 

2369
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:57,430
civilization some of that have to do
with the right speeches with a space

2370
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:57,440
with the right speeches with a space
 

2371
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,790
with the right speeches with a space
race

2372
00:37:58,790 --> 00:37:58,800
race
 

2373
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,390
race
like space

2374
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:00,400
like space
 

2375
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,829
like space
depending on how it's presented can be

2376
00:38:01,829 --> 00:38:01,839
depending on how it's presented can be
 

2377
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:03,190
depending on how it's presented can be
boring

2378
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:03,200
boring
 

2379
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,630
boring
i don't i don't

2380
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:04,640
i don't i don't
 

2381
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,310
i don't i don't
i i don't think it's been that so far

2382
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:06,320
i i don't think it's been that so far
 

2383
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,150
i i don't think it's been that so far
but i've actually i i think space is

2384
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:08,160
but i've actually i i think space is
 

2385
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,310
but i've actually i i think space is

00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:33,520
that like you're not you know that that
 

2853
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,270
that like you're not you know that that
comes from the accumulation of life

2854
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:35,280
comes from the accumulation of life
 

2855
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,870
comes from the accumulation of life
experience accumulation of observation

2856
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:36,880
experience accumulation of observation
 

2857
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:40,069
experience accumulation of observation
and experience over many generations and

2858
00:45:40,069 --> 00:45:40,079
and experience over many generations and
 

2859
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:41,750
and experience over many generations and
that's a little mini version of the

2860
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:41,760
that's a little mini version of the
 

2861
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,750
that's a little mini version of the
collective super intelligence it's like

2862
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:43,760
collective super intelligence it's like
 

2863
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,829
collective super intelligence it's like
you know it's equivalent of like making

2864
00:45:45,829 --> 00:45:45,839
you know it's equivalent of like making
 

2865
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:47,589
you know it's equivalent of like making
a pencil today like

2866
00:45:47,589 --> 00:45:47,599
a pencil today like
 

2867
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:48,630
a pencil today like
um

2868
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:48,640
um
 

2869
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,870
um
people back then like the the

2870
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:50,880
people back then like the the
 

2871
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,870
people back then like the the
conventional wisdom like had this super

2872
00:45:52,870 --> 00:45:52,880
conventional wisdom like had this super
 

2873
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,790
conventional wisdom like had this super
this this knowledge that no human could

2874
00:45:54,790 --> 00:45:54,800
this this knowledge that no human could
 

2875
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,190
this this knowledge that no human could
ever accumulate so we're very wired to

2876
00:45:57,190 --> 00:45:57,200
ever accumulate so we're very wired to
 

2877
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,430
ever accumulate so we're very wired to
trust it plus the secondary thing is

2878
00:45:59,430 --> 00:45:59,440
trust it plus the secondary thing is
 

2879
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:00,950
trust it plus the secondary thing is
that the people who you know just say

2880
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:00,960
that the people who you know just say
 

2881
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,710
that the people who you know just say
that they believe the mountain is they

2882
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:02,720
that they believe the mountain is they
 

2883
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,150
that they believe the mountain is they
worship the mountain is their god right

worship the mountain is their god right
 

2885
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,430
worship the mountain is their god right
and they go and the mountain determines

2886
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:05,440
and they go and the mountain determines
 

2887
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,270
and they go and the mountain determines
their fate that's not true right and the

2888
00:46:07,270 --> 00:46:07,280
their fate that's not true right and the
 

2889
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,190
their fate that's not true right and the
conventional wisdom is wrong there but

2890
00:46:09,190 --> 00:46:09,200
conventional wisdom is wrong there but
 

2891
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:12,630
conventional wisdom is wrong there but
um believing it was helpful to survival

2892
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:12,640
um believing it was helpful to survival
 

2893
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,470
um believing it was helpful to survival
because you were one you you you were

2894
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:14,480
because you were one you you you were
 

2895

because you were one you you you were
part of the crowd and you stayed in the

part of the crowd and you stayed in the
 

2897
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:17,670
part of the crowd and you stayed in the
tribe and if you started to you know you

2898
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:17,680
tribe and if you started to you know you
 

2899
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:20,150
tribe and if you started to you know you
know insult their the mountain god and

2900
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:20,160
know insult their the mountain god and
 

2901

2903
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,270
say that's just a mountain it's not you
know you didn't fare very well right so

2904
00:46:23,270 --> 00:46:23,280
know you didn't fare very well right so
 

2905
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,550
know you didn't fare very well right so
it would for a lot of reasons it was a

2906
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:24,560
it would for a lot of reasons it was a
 

2907
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:26,710
it would for a lot of reasons it was a
great survival trait to just trust what

2908
00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:26,720
great survival trait to just trust what
 

2909
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,349
great survival trait to just trust what
other people said uh and believe it and

2910
00:46:29,349 --> 00:46:29,359
other people said uh and believe it and
 

2911
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:31,190
other people said uh and believe it and
truly obviously you know the more you

2912
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:31,200
truly obviously you know the more you
 

2913
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,790
truly obviously you know the more you
really believed it the better

2914
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:32,800
really believed it the better
 

2915
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:33,990
really believed it the better
today

2916
00:46:33,990 --> 00:46:34,000
today
 

2917
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,710
today
um conventional wisdom

2918
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:36,720
um conventional wisdom
 

2919
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:39,030
um conventional wisdom
in a rapidly changing world

2920
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:39,040
in a rapidly changing world
 

2921
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,030
in a rapidly changing world
um and a huge

2922
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:41,040
um and a huge
 

2923
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,349
um and a huge
giant society our brains are not built

2924
00:46:43,349 --> 00:46:43,359
giant society our brains are not built
 

2925
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:44,470
giant society our brains are not built
to understand that they have a few

2926
00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:44,480
to understand that they have a few
 

2927
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,270
to understand that they have a few
settings you know and none of them is uh

2928
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:47,280
settings you know and none of them is uh
 

2929
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,750
settings you know and none of them is uh
you know 300 million person society so

2930
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:49,760
you know 300 million person society so
 

2931
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:52,550
you know 300 million person society so
they're so your brain is basically

2932
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:52,560
they're so your brain is basically
 

2933
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,670
they're so your brain is basically
um

2934
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:53,680
um
 

2935
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:54,710
um
uh

2936
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:54,720
uh
 

2937
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:57,190
uh
is treating a lot of things like a small

2938
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:57,200
is treating a lot of things like a small
 

2939
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,790
is treating a lot of things like a small
tribe even though they're not they're tr

2940
00:46:58,790 --> 00:46:58,800
tribe even though they're not they're tr
 

2941
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,069
tribe even though they're not they're tr
and and they're treating conventional

2942
00:47:00,069 --> 00:47:00,079
and and they're treating conventional
 

2943
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:02,790
and and they're treating conventional
wisdom as as you know very wise

2944
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:02,800
wisdom as as you know very wise
 

2945
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:03,910
wisdom as as you know very wise
in a way that it's not you think about

2946
00:47:03,910 --> 00:47:03,920
in a way that it's not you think about
 

2947
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,910
in a way that it's not you think about
it this way it's like a picture a like a

2948
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:05,920
it this way it's like a picture a like a
 

2949
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:08,069
it this way it's like a picture a like a
bucket that's not moving very much

2950
00:47:08,069 --> 00:47:08,079
bucket that's not moving very much
 

2951
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:09,589
bucket that's not moving very much
moving like a millimeter a year and so

2952
00:47:09,589 --> 00:47:09,599
moving like a millimeter a year and so
 

2953
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:10,870
moving like a millimeter a year and so
it has time to collect a lot of water

2954
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:10,880
it has time to collect a lot of water
 

2955
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:11,910
it has time to collect a lot of water
and it that's like conventional wisdom

2956
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:11,920
and it that's like conventional wisdom
 

2957
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,270
and it that's like conventional wisdom
in the old days when very few things

2958
00:47:13,270 --> 00:47:13,280
in the old days when very few things
 

2959
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,750
in the old days when very few things
change like your your ten your

2960
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:14,760
change like your your ten your
 

2961
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:15,990
change like your your ten your
great-great-great-grandmother probably

2962
00:47:15,990 --> 00:47:16,000
great-great-great-grandmother probably
 

2963
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,270
great-great-great-grandmother probably
lived a similar life to you maybe on the

2964
00:47:17,270 --> 00:47:17,280
lived a similar life to you maybe on the
 

2965
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,109
lived a similar life to you maybe on the
same piece of land

2966
00:47:19,109 --> 00:47:19,119
same piece of land
 

2967
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:20,390
same piece of land
and so old people really knew what they

2968
00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:20,400
and so old people really knew what they
 

2969
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:21,750
and so old people really knew what they
were talking about today the bucket's

2970
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:21,760
were talking about today the bucket's
 

2971
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,190
were talking about today the bucket's
moving really quickly

2972
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:23,200
moving really quickly
 

2973
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,470
moving really quickly
and so you know the wisdom doesn't

2974
00:47:24,470 --> 00:47:24,480
and so you know the wisdom doesn't
 

2975
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,309
and so you know the wisdom doesn't
accumulate but we think it does because

2976
00:47:26,309 --> 00:47:26,319
accumulate but we think it does because
 

2977
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:27,990
accumulate but we think it does because
our brain settings doesn't have the oh

2978
00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:28,000
our brain settings doesn't have the oh
 

2979
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,710
our brain settings doesn't have the oh
move you know quickly moving bucket uh

2980
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:30,720
move you know quickly moving bucket uh
 

2981
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:33,910
move you know quickly moving bucket uh
setting on it so um my grandmother

2982
00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:33,920
setting on it so um my grandmother
 

2983
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,470
setting on it so um my grandmother
gives me advice all the time and

2984
00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:36,480
gives me advice all the time and
 

2985
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,710
gives me advice all the time and
i have to decide is this so there are

2986
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:38,720
i have to decide is this so there are
 

2987
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,069
i have to decide is this so there are
certain things that are not changing

2988
00:47:40,069 --> 00:47:40,079
certain things that are not changing
 

2989
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:42,630
certain things that are not changing
like relationships and love and loyalty

2990
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:42,640
like relationships and love and loyalty
 

2991
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:43,910
like relationships and love and loyalty
and things like this

2992
00:47:43,910 --> 00:47:43,920
and things like this
 

2993
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,190
and things like this
her advice on those things i'll listen

2994
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:45,200
her advice on those things i'll listen
 

2995
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,390
her advice on those things i'll listen
to it all day she's one of the people

2996
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:46,400
to it all day she's one of the people
 

2997
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:47,910
to it all day she's one of the people
who said you got to live near you people

2998
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:47,920

you love live near your family right i
think that is like tremendous wisdom

3002
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:52,480
think that is like tremendous wisdom
 

3003
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:53,589
think that is like tremendous wisdom
right that is wisdom because that

3004
00:47:53,589 --> 00:47:53,599
right that is wisdom because that
 

3005
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:54,710
right that is wisdom because that
happens to be something that hasn't

3006
00:47:54,710 --> 00:47:54,720
happens to be something that hasn't
 

3007
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:55,829
happens to be something that hasn't
doesn't change from generation to

3008
00:47:55,829 --> 00:47:55,839
doesn't change from generation to
 

3009

3169
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,349
it was that day and not what it you know
not people conventional wisdom was still

not people conventional wisdom was still
 

3171
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:21,270

up to show him this is not a good idea

3182
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:32,000
up to show him this is not a good idea
 

3183
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,309
up to show him this is not a good idea
and if but just even the bigger picture

00:50:39,589 --> 00:50:39,599
start launching rockets and you know the
 

3191
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:42,390
start launching rockets and you know the
amount that failed i mean it's it's not

3192
00:50:42,390 --> 00:50:42,400
amount that failed i mean it's it's not

landing rockets was another thing you

3200
00:50:49,190 --> 00:50:49,200
landing rockets was another thing you
 

3201
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,109
landing rockets was another thing you
know well if you know here's the classic

3202
00:50:51,109 --> 00:50:51,119
know well if you know here's the classic
 

3203
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:54,230
know well if you know here's the classic
kind of way we are we reason which is if

this could be done nasa would have done

3206
00:50:56,069 --> 00:50:56,079
this could be done nasa would have done
 

3207
00:50:56,079 --> 00:50:57,750
this could be done nasa would have done
it a long time ago because of the money

3208
00:50:57,750 --> 00:50:57,760
it a long time ago because of the money
 

3209
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:59,109
it a long time ago because of the money
it would save this could be done the

3210
00:50:59,109 --> 00:50:59,119
it would save this could be done the
 

3211
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:00,309
it would save this could be done the
soviet union would have done it back in

3212
00:51:00,309 --> 00:51:00,319
soviet union would have done it back in
 

3213
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:02,710
soviet union would have done it back in
the 60s uh it's obviously something that

3214
00:51:02,710 --> 00:51:02,720
the 60s uh it's obviously something that
 

3215
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:04,230
the 60s uh it's obviously something that
can't be done and

3216
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:04,240
can't be done and
 

3217
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,309
can't be done and
the math on his envelope said well i

3218
00:51:06,309 --> 00:51:06,319
the math on his envelope said well i
 

3219
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:07,670
the math on his envelope said well i
think it can be done and so he just did

3220
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:07,680
think it can be done and so he just did
 

3221
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,589
think it can be done and so he just did
it so in each of these cases i think

3222
00:51:09,589 --> 00:51:09,599
it so in each of these cases i think
 

3223
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:11,109
it so in each of these cases i think
actually in some ways elon gets too much

3224
00:51:11,109 --> 00:51:11,119
actually in some ways elon gets too much
 

3225
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:12,790
actually in some ways elon gets too much
credit as you know people think it's

3226
00:51:12,790 --> 00:51:12,800
credit as you know people think it's
 

3227
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,230
credit as you know people think it's
it's that he's you know it's that his

it's that he's you know it's that his
 

3229
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,150
it's that he's you know it's that his
einstein intelligence or he can see the

3230
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:16,160
einstein intelligence or he can see the
 

3231
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,710
einstein intelligence or he can see the
future he has incredible uh he has

00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:18,720
future he has incredible uh he has
 

3233
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:20,069
future he has incredible uh he has
incredible guts he's so you know

3234
00:51:20,069 --> 00:51:20,079
incredible guts he's so you know
 

3235
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:21,910
incredible guts he's so you know
courageous i think if you actually are

3236
00:51:21,910 --> 00:51:21,920
courageous i think if you actually are
 

3237

looking at reality
 

3239
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:25,430
looking at reality
uh and you're just assessing

3240
00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:25,440
uh and you're just assessing
 

3241
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,670
uh and you're just assessing
probabilities and you're ignoring all

3242
00:51:27,670 --> 00:51:27,680
probabilities and you're ignoring all
 

3243
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:30,150
probabilities and you're ignoring all
the noise which is wrong so wrong right

3244
00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:30,160
the noise which is wrong so wrong right
 

3245
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,349
the noise which is wrong so wrong right
and you just

3246
00:51:31,349 --> 00:51:31,359
and you just
 

3247

you know part of it is that we see that
 

3261
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,750
you know part of it is that we see that
we can't build a pencil we can't build

00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,309
were doing their kind of motowny chord
patterns in the early 60s and they they

3280
00:52:04,309 --> 00:52:04,319
patterns in the early 60s and they they
 

3281
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:05,589
patterns in the early 60s and they they
were doing what was normal they were

3282

00:52:07,349 --> 00:52:07,359
doing what was clearly this kind of
 

3285
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:08,710
doing what was clearly this kind of
sound is a hit

3286
00:52:08,710 --> 00:52:08,720
sound is a hit
 

3287
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,150
sound is a hit
then they started getting weird because

3288
00:52:10,150 --> 00:52:10,160
then they started getting weird because
 

3289
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,589
then they started getting weird because
they had they were so popular they had

they had they were so popular they had
this confidence to say let's just we're

3292
00:52:13,030 --> 00:52:13,040
this confidence to say let's just we're
 

3293
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:15,030
this confidence to say let's just we're
going to start just experimenting

3294
00:52:15,030 --> 00:52:15,040
going to start just experimenting
 

3295
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:17,270
going to start just experimenting
and it turns out that like if you're

3296
00:52:17,270 --> 00:52:17,280
and it turns out that like if you're
 

3297
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:18,549
and it turns out that like if you're
just all these people are in this like

3298
00:52:18,549 --> 00:52:18,559
just all these people are in this like
 

3299
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:20,390
just all these people are in this like
one groove together doing music and it's

one groove together doing music and it's
 

3301
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:21,990
one groove together doing music and it's
just like there's a lot of land over

3302
00:52:21,990 --> 00:52:22,000
just like there's a lot of land over
 

3303

there
 

3305
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,710
there
and it seems like you know i'm sure the

3306
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:24,720
and it seems like you know i'm sure the
 

3307
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,710
and it seems like you know i'm sure the
managers would say and that the the the

all the record exactly say no you have
to be here this is what sells and it's

3312
00:52:30,549 --> 00:52:30,559
to be here this is what sells and it's
 

3313

this that actually elon likes to use is
 

3319
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:38,470
this that actually elon likes to use is
reasoning from first principles the

3320
00:52:38,470 --> 00:52:38,480
reasoning from first principles the
 

3321
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,470
reasoning from first principles the
physics term uh first principles are

3322
00:52:40,470 --> 00:52:40,480
physics term uh first principles are
 

3323
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,470
physics term uh first principles are
your axioms and physicists they don't

3324
00:52:42,470 --> 00:52:42,480
your axioms and physicists they don't
 

3325
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,069
your axioms and physicists they don't
say well what's you know what what's

00:52:44,069 --> 00:52:44,079
say well what's you know what what's

what do people think no they say what

3328
00:52:45,430 --> 00:52:45,440
what do people think no they say what
 

3329
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:46,790
what do people think no they say what
are the axioms those are the puzzle

3330
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:46,800
are the axioms those are the puzzle
 

3331
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,390
are the axioms those are the puzzle
pieces let's use those to build a

00:52:48,390 --> 00:52:48,400
pieces let's use those to build a
 

3333
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,230
pieces let's use those to build a
conclusion that's our hypothesis now

00:52:50,230 --> 00:52:50,240
conclusion that's our hypothesis now
 

3335
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:51,670
conclusion that's our hypothesis now
let's test it right and and they they

3336
00:52:51,670 --> 00:52:51,680
let's test it right and and they they
 

3337
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,190
let's test it right and and they they
come up with all kinds of new things

3338
00:52:53,190 --> 00:52:53,200
come up with all kinds of new things
 

3339
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,870
come up with all kinds of new things
constantly by doing that

if einstein was was assuming

00:52:56,390 --> 00:52:56,400
if einstein was was assuming
 

3343
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:57,589
if einstein was was assuming
conventional wisdom was right he never

3344
00:52:57,589 --> 00:52:57,599
conventional wisdom was right he never
 

3345
00:52:57,599 --> 00:52:59,030
conventional wisdom was right he never
would have even tried to create

3346
00:52:59,030 --> 00:52:59,040
would have even tried to create
 

3347
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:01,190
would have even tried to create
something that really disproved newton's

3348
00:53:01,190 --> 00:53:01,200
something that really disproved newton's
 

3349
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,910
something that really disproved newton's
laws and the other way to reason is

3350
00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:03,920
laws and the other way to reason is
 

3351
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,630
laws and the other way to reason is
reasoning by analogy which is a

3352
00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:06,640
reasoning by analogy which is a
 

3353
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,870
reasoning by analogy which is a
uh great shortcut it's it's when we look

3354
00:53:08,870 --> 00:53:08,880
uh great shortcut it's it's when we look
 

3355
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,710
uh great shortcut it's it's when we look
at other people's reasoning and we kind

3356
00:53:10,710 --> 00:53:10,720
at other people's reasoning and we kind
 

3357
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,470
at other people's reasoning and we kind
of photocopy it into our head we steal

3358
00:53:12,470 --> 00:53:12,480
of photocopy it into our head we steal
 

3359
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,190
of photocopy it into our head we steal
it

3360
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:13,200
it
 

3361
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,510
it
so uh reasoning by analogy we do all the

3362
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:15,520
so uh reasoning by analogy we do all the
 

3363
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:16,870
so uh reasoning by analogy we do all the
time and it's usually a good thing i

3364
00:53:16,870 --> 00:53:16,880
time and it's usually a good thing i
 

3365
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:18,549
time and it's usually a good thing i
mean we don't if you it takes a lot of

3366
00:53:18,549 --> 00:53:18,559
mean we don't if you it takes a lot of
 

3367
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:19,910
mean we don't if you it takes a lot of
mental energy and time to reason from

3368
00:53:19,910 --> 00:53:19,920
mental energy and time to reason from
 

3369
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,270
mental energy and time to reason from
first principles it's actually you know

3370
00:53:21,270 --> 00:53:21,280
first principles it's actually you know
 

3371
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,470
first principles it's actually you know
you don't want to reinvent the wheel

3372
00:53:22,470 --> 00:53:22,480
you don't want to reinvent the wheel
 

3373
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:25,109
you don't want to reinvent the wheel
every time right you want to often copy

3374
00:53:25,109 --> 00:53:25,119
every time right you want to often copy
 

3375
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:26,630
every time right you want to often copy
uh other people's reasoning most of the

3376
00:53:26,630 --> 00:53:26,640
uh other people's reasoning most of the
 

3377
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:28,069
uh other people's reasoning most of the
time and i you know most of us do it

3378
00:53:28,069 --> 00:53:28,079
time and i you know most of us do it
 

3379
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:29,109
time and i you know most of us do it
most of the time and that's good but

3380
00:53:29,109 --> 00:53:29,119
most of the time and that's good but
 

3381
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:30,549
most of the time and that's good but
there's certain moments when you forget

3382
00:53:30,549 --> 00:53:30,559
there's certain moments when you forget
 

3383
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:32,630
there's certain moments when you forget
just for a second like succeeding in

00:53:32,630 --> 00:53:32,640
just for a second like succeeding in
 

3385
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:34,309
just for a second like succeeding in

your life those should not be reasoned
 

3409
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:53,670
your life those should not be reasoned
by analogy you should absolutely try to

3410
00:53:53,670 --> 00:53:53,680
by analogy you should absolutely try to
 

3411
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:56,309
by analogy you should absolutely try to
reason from first principles and elon

3412
00:53:56,309 --> 00:53:56,319
reason from first principles and elon
 

3413
00:53:56,319 --> 00:53:58,390
reason from first principles and elon
not just by the way in his work but in

00:53:58,390 --> 00:53:58,400
not just by the way in his work but in
 

3415
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:59,670
not just by the way in his work but in
his personal life i mean if you just

3416
00:53:59,670 --> 00:53:59,680
his personal life i mean if you just
 

3417
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:01,750
his personal life i mean if you just
look at the way he's on twitter he's not

3418
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:01,760
look at the way he's on twitter he's not

i think uh

3440
00:54:19,510 --> 00:54:19,520
i think uh
 

3441
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:21,670
i think uh
it has taken him where it has taken yeah

3442
00:54:21,670 --> 00:54:21,680
it has taken him where it has taken yeah
 

3443
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:23,349
it has taken him where it has taken yeah
i mean i probably wouldn't describe his

3444
00:54:23,349 --> 00:54:23,359
i mean i probably wouldn't describe his
 

3445
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:25,030
i mean i probably wouldn't describe his
approach to twitter as first

3446
00:54:25,030 --> 00:54:25,040
approach to twitter as first
 

3447
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:26,549
approach to twitter as first
first principles but i guess that's the

3448
00:54:26,549 --> 00:54:26,559
first principles but i guess that's the
 

3449
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:28,790
first principles but i guess that's the
same i think it is well first of all i

3450
00:54:28,790 --> 00:54:28,800
same i think it is well first of all i
 

3451
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,069
same i think it is well first of all i
will say that a lot of tweets people

3452
00:54:30,069 --> 00:54:30,079
will say that a lot of tweets people
 

3453
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:31,750
will say that a lot of tweets people
think oh like he's gonna be done after

3454
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:31,760
think oh like he's gonna be done after
 

3455
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,510
think oh like he's gonna be done after
that he's fine he's on you know he's

3456
00:54:33,510 --> 00:54:33,520
that he's fine he's on you know he's
 

3457
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,109
that he's fine he's on you know he's
just he's just one man time man of the

3458
00:54:35,109 --> 00:54:35,119
just he's just one man time man of the
 

3459
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:36,069
just he's just one man time man of the
year like

3460
00:54:36,069 --> 00:54:36,079
year like
 

3461
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:38,390
year like
it's something is it's not syncing him

3462
00:54:38,390 --> 00:54:38,400
it's something is it's not syncing him
 

3463
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,990
it's something is it's not syncing him
and i think you know it's not that it's

3464
00:54:39,990 --> 00:54:40,000
and i think you know it's not that it's
 

3465
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,030
and i think you know it's not that it's
not that i think this is like super

3466
00:54:41,030 --> 00:54:41,040
not that i think this is like super
 

3467
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,230
not that i think this is like super
reasoned out i think that you know

3468
00:54:42,230 --> 00:54:42,240
reasoned out i think that you know
 

3469
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:43,990
reasoned out i think that you know
twitter is his silly side but

3470
00:54:43,990 --> 00:54:44,000
twitter is his silly side but
 

3471
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,430
twitter is his silly side but
i think that

3472
00:54:45,430 --> 00:54:45,440
i think that
 

3473
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:47,030
i think that
he

3474
00:54:47,030 --> 00:54:47,040
he
 

3475
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:49,510
he
saw he would his reasoning did not feel

3476
00:54:49,510 --> 00:54:49,520
saw he would his reasoning did not feel
 

3477
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:50,870
saw he would his reasoning did not feel
like there was a giant risk and just

3478
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:50,880
like there was a giant risk and just
 

3479
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,549
like there was a giant risk and just
being his silly self on twitter when a

3480
00:54:52,549 --> 00:54:52,559
being his silly self on twitter when a
 

3481
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:53,750
being his silly self on twitter when a
lot of billionaires would say well no

3482
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:53,760
lot of billionaires would say well no
 

3483
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:56,230
lot of billionaires would say well no
one else is doing that yes so it must be

3484
00:54:56,230 --> 00:54:56,240
one else is doing that yes so it must be
 

3485
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:57,990
one else is doing that yes so it must be
a good reason right

3486
00:54:57,990 --> 00:54:58,000
a good reason right
 

3487
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,950
a good reason right
well i gotta say that he inspires me too

3488
00:55:00,950 --> 00:55:00,960
well i gotta say that he inspires me too
 

3489
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,710
well i gotta say that he inspires me too
that it's okay to be silly

3490
00:55:02,710 --> 00:55:02,720
that it's okay to be silly
 

3491
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:05,430
that it's okay to be silly
totally on twitter and um

3492
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:05,440
totally on twitter and um
 

3493
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:06,950
totally on twitter and um
but yeah you're right the big

3494
00:55:06,950 --> 00:55:06,960
but yeah you're right the big
 

3495
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:08,630
but yeah you're right the big
inspiration is the willingness to do

3496
00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:08,640
inspiration is the willingness to do
 

3497
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:10,789
inspiration is the willingness to do
that when nobody else is doing it

3498
00:55:10,789 --> 00:55:10,799
that when nobody else is doing it
 

3499
00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:12,470
that when nobody else is doing it
yeah and i think about all the great

3500
00:55:12,470 --> 00:55:12,480
yeah and i think about all the great
 

3501
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,870
yeah and i think about all the great
artists you know all the great inventors

3502
00:55:14,870 --> 00:55:14,880
artists you know all the great inventors
 

3503
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:17,589
artists you know all the great inventors
and entrepreneurs almost all of them

3504
00:55:17,589 --> 00:55:17,599
and entrepreneurs almost all of them
 

3505
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:18,870
and entrepreneurs almost all of them
they had a moment when they trusted

3506
00:55:18,870 --> 00:55:18,880
they had a moment when they trusted
 

3507
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:21,109
they had a moment when they trusted
their reasoning i mean airbnb

3508
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:21,119
their reasoning i mean airbnb
 

3509
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:22,470
their reasoning i mean airbnb
was

3510
00:55:22,470 --> 00:55:22,480
was
 

3511
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,710
was
over 60 with vcs

3512
00:55:24,710 --> 00:55:24,720
over 60 with vcs
 

3513
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:27,030
over 60 with vcs
a lot of people say obviously

3514
00:55:27,030 --> 00:55:27,040
a lot of people say obviously
 

3515
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:28,870
a lot of people say obviously
they know something we done right but

3516
00:55:28,870 --> 00:55:28,880
they know something we done right but
 

3517
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,150
they know something we done right but
they didn't they said i think they're

3518
00:55:30,150 --> 00:55:30,160
they didn't they said i think they're
 

3519
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:31,589
they didn't they said i think they're
all wrong i mean that's that takes some

3520
00:55:31,589 --> 00:55:31,599
all wrong i mean that's that takes some
 

3521
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:34,069
all wrong i mean that's that takes some
kind of different wiring in your brain

3522
00:55:34,069 --> 00:55:34,079
kind of different wiring in your brain
 

3523
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:37,030
kind of different wiring in your brain
and then that's both for big picture and

3524
00:55:37,030 --> 00:55:37,040
and then that's both for big picture and
 

3525
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:39,349
and then that's both for big picture and
details like engineering problems

3526
00:55:39,349 --> 00:55:39,359
details like engineering problems
 

3527
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:41,510
details like engineering problems
it's fun to talk to him it's fun to talk

3528
00:55:41,510 --> 00:55:41,520
it's fun to talk to him it's fun to talk
 

3529
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,190
it's fun to talk to him it's fun to talk
jim keller who's a good example of this

3530
00:55:43,190 --> 00:55:43,200
jim keller who's a good example of this
 

3531
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:44,390
jim keller who's a good example of this
kind of thinking

3532
00:55:44,390 --> 00:55:44,400
kind of thinking
 

3533
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,710
kind of thinking
about like manufacturing how to get

3534
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:46,720
about like manufacturing how to get
 

3535
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,870
about like manufacturing how to get
costs down they always talk about like

3536
00:55:48,870 --> 00:55:48,880
costs down they always talk about like
 

3537
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:51,990
costs down they always talk about like
they talk about spacex rockets this way

3538
00:55:51,990 --> 00:55:52,000
they talk about spacex rockets this way
 

3539
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,750
they talk about spacex rockets this way
they talk about manufacturing this way

3540
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:53,760
they talk about manufacturing this way
 

3541
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:54,710
they talk about manufacturing this way
like

3542
00:55:54,710 --> 00:55:54,720
like
 

3543
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:55,829
like
um

3544
00:55:55,829 --> 00:55:55,839
um
 

3545
00:55:55,839 --> 00:55:58,309
um
cost per pound or

3546
00:55:58,309 --> 00:55:58,319
cost per pound or
 

3547
00:55:58,319 --> 00:56:00,069
cost per pound or
per ton

3548
00:56:00,069 --> 00:56:00,079
per ton
 

3549
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:02,390
per ton
to get to orbit or something like that

3550
00:56:02,390 --> 00:56:02,400
to get to orbit or something like that
 

3551
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,829
to get to orbit or something like that
this is other reason we need to get the

3552
00:56:03,829 --> 00:56:03,839
this is other reason we need to get the
 

3553
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:05,910
this is other reason we need to get the
cost down it's a very kind of raw

3554
00:56:05,910 --> 00:56:05,920
cost down it's a very kind of raw
 

3555
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:07,750
cost down it's a very kind of raw
materials yeah

3556
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:07,760
materials yeah
 

3557
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:10,230
materials yeah
like just very basic way of thinking

3558
00:56:10,230 --> 00:56:10,240
like just very basic way of thinking
 

3559
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:11,589
like just very basic way of thinking
first principles

3560
00:56:11,589 --> 00:56:11,599
first principles
 

3561
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:13,109
first principles
it's really yeah and the first

3562
00:56:13,109 --> 00:56:13,119
it's really yeah and the first
 

3563
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:15,030
it's really yeah and the first
principles of rocket are like the price

3564
00:56:15,030 --> 00:56:15,040
principles of rocket are like the price
 

3565
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:17,829
principles of rocket are like the price
of raw materials and gravity

3566
00:56:17,829 --> 00:56:17,839
of raw materials and gravity
 

3567
00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:19,270
of raw materials and gravity
you know and

3568
00:56:19,270 --> 00:56:19,280
you know and
 

3569
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:20,789
you know and
wind i mean these are your first

the assembly line right i mean he did

3578
00:56:32,549 --> 00:56:32,559
the assembly line right i mean he did
 

3579
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:34,950
the assembly line right i mean he did
that he he thought for a second and said

3580
00:56:34,950 --> 00:56:34,960
that he he thought for a second and said
 

3581
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,870
that he he thought for a second and said
this isn't how manufacturing is normally

3582
00:56:36,870 --> 00:56:36,880
this isn't how manufacturing is normally
 

3583
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:38,309
this isn't how manufacturing is normally
you know it's normally done this way but

3584
00:56:38,309 --> 00:56:38,319
you know it's normally done this way but
 

3585
00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:39,829
you know it's normally done this way but
i think this is a different kind of

3586
00:56:39,829 --> 00:56:39,839
i think this is a different kind of
 

3587
00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:41,430
i think this is a different kind of
product and that's what changed it

3588
00:56:41,430 --> 00:56:41,440
product and that's what changed it
 

3589
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:42,549
product and that's what changed it
because you know and then what happens

3590
00:56:42,549 --> 00:56:42,559
because you know and then what happens
 

3591
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:43,829
because you know and then what happens
is when someone reasons from first

3592
00:56:43,829 --> 00:56:43,839
is when someone reasons from first
 

3593
00:56:43,839 --> 00:56:45,589

he just said you know if i think this is

3616
00:57:04,390 --> 00:57:04,400
he just said you know if i think this is
 

3617
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:05,750
he just said you know if i think this is
right like everyone and that i mean i

3618
00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:05,760
right like everyone and that i mean i
 

3619
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,190
right like everyone and that i mean i
don't know how i don't know how he does

that and and i don't think apple can do
 

3623
00:57:08,799 --> 00:57:10,549
that and and i don't think apple can do
that anymore i mean they lost that that

3624

the amount of americans that hate other
americans is on the rise

3788
00:59:46,710 --> 00:59:46,720
americans is on the rise

00:59:49,839 --> 00:59:52,710
president is on the rise all these
things like on the very steep rise

3794
00:59:52,710 --> 00:59:52,720
things like on the very steep rise
 

3795
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:54,549
things like on the very steep rise
so what the hell what's going on like

3796
00:59:54,549 --> 00:59:54,559
so what the hell what's going on like
 

3797
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:55,510
so what the hell what's going on like
there's something there's something

3798
00:59:55,510 --> 00:59:55,520
there's something there's something
 

3799
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:56,950
there's something there's something
causing that it's not that we know a

3800
00:59:56,950 --> 00:59:56,960
causing that it's not that we know a
 

3801
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:58,390
causing that it's not that we know a
bunch of new people were born who were

3802
00:59:58,390 --> 00:59:58,400
bunch of new people were born who were
 

3803
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:00,470
bunch of new people were born who were
just dicks it's that

3804
01:00:00,470 --> 01:00:00,480
just dicks it's that
 

3805
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:02,069
just dicks it's that
something is going on so i think of it

3806
01:00:02,069 --> 01:00:02,079
something is going on so i think of it
 

3807
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:03,190
something is going on so i think of it
as

3808
01:00:03,190 --> 01:00:03,200
as
 

3809
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:06,470
as
a very simple oversimplified equation um

3810
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:06,480
a very simple oversimplified equation um
 

3811
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:09,750
a very simple oversimplified equation um
human behavior uh and it's the output

3812
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:09,760
human behavior uh and it's the output
 

3813
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:11,109
human behavior uh and it's the output
that i think the two inputs are human

3814
01:00:11,109 --> 01:00:11,119
that i think the two inputs are human
 

3815
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:13,589
that i think the two inputs are human
nature and environment right and this is

3816
01:00:13,589 --> 01:00:13,599
nature and environment right and this is
 

3817
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:15,750
nature and environment right and this is
basic you know super super kindergarten

3818
01:00:15,750 --> 01:00:15,760
basic you know super super kindergarten
 

3819
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:18,309
basic you know super super kindergarten
level like you know uh animal behavior

3820
01:00:18,309 --> 01:00:18,319
level like you know uh animal behavior
 

3821
01:00:18,319 --> 01:00:19,910
level like you know uh animal behavior
but i think it's worth thinking about

3822
01:00:19,910 --> 01:00:19,920
but i think it's worth thinking about
 

3823
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:21,829
but i think it's worth thinking about
you've got human nature which is not

3824
01:00:21,829 --> 01:00:21,839
you've got human nature which is not
 

3825
01:00:21,839 --> 01:00:23,910
you've got human nature which is not
changing very much right

3826
01:00:23,910 --> 01:00:23,920
changing very much right
 

3827
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:24,870
changing very much right
and

3828
01:00:24,870 --> 01:00:24,880
and
 

3829
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:27,430
and
then you got you throw that nature

3830
01:00:27,430 --> 01:00:27,440
then you got you throw that nature
 

3831
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:29,510
then you got you throw that nature
into a certain environment and it reacts

3832
01:00:29,510 --> 01:00:29,520
into a certain environment and it reacts
 

3833
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:31,750
into a certain environment and it reacts
to the environment right it's shaped by

3834
01:00:31,750 --> 01:00:31,760
to the environment right it's shaped by
 

3835
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:33,670
to the environment right it's shaped by
the environment and then eventually what

3836
01:00:33,670 --> 01:00:33,680
the environment and then eventually what
 

3837
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:35,589
the environment and then eventually what
what comes out is behavior

3838
01:00:35,589 --> 01:00:35,599
what comes out is behavior
 

3839
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:37,589
what comes out is behavior
right human nature is not changing very

3840
01:00:37,589 --> 01:00:37,599
right human nature is not changing very
 

3841
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:39,270
right human nature is not changing very
much but suddenly we're behaving

3842
01:00:39,270 --> 01:00:39,280
much but suddenly we're behaving
 

3843
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:41,109
much but suddenly we're behaving
differently right we are

3844
01:00:41,109 --> 01:00:41,119
differently right we are
 

3845
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:43,030
differently right we are
again you know look at the polls like it

3846
01:00:43,030 --> 01:00:43,040
again you know look at the polls like it
 

3847
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:44,950
again you know look at the polls like it
used to be that the president you know

3848
01:00:44,950 --> 01:00:44,960
used to be that the president you know
 

3849
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:46,549
used to be that the president you know
was liked by i don't remember the exact

3850
01:00:46,549 --> 01:00:46,559
was liked by i don't remember the exact
 

3851
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:47,910
was liked by i don't remember the exact
numbers but you know

3852
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:47,920
numbers but you know
 

3853
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:50,710
numbers but you know
80 or 70 percent of of the their own

3854
01:00:50,710 --> 01:00:50,720
80 or 70 percent of of the their own
 

3855
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:52,789
80 or 70 percent of of the their own
party and you know 50 of the other party

3856
01:00:52,789 --> 01:00:52,799
party and you know 50 of the other party
 

3857
01:00:52,799 --> 01:00:54,470
party and you know 50 of the other party
and now it's like 40 of their own party

3858
01:00:54,470 --> 01:00:54,480
and now it's like 40 of their own party
 

3859
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:56,470
and now it's like 40 of their own party
and 10 of the other party you know it's

3860
01:00:56,470 --> 01:00:56,480
and 10 of the other party you know it's
 

3861
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:58,470
and 10 of the other party you know it's
it's and it's not that the presidents

3862
01:00:58,470 --> 01:00:58,480
it's and it's not that the presidents
 

3863
01:00:58,480 --> 01:00:59,510
it's and it's not that the presidents
are getting worse since maybe some

3864
01:00:59,510 --> 01:00:59,520
are getting worse since maybe some
 

3865
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:01,510
are getting worse since maybe some
people would argue that they are but

3866
01:01:01,510 --> 01:01:01,520
people would argue that they are but
 

3867
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:04,150
people would argue that they are but
more so there's a lot of you know idiot

3868
01:01:04,150 --> 01:01:04,160
more so there's a lot of you know idiot
 

3869
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:06,069
more so there's a lot of you know idiot
presidents throughout the what's going

3870
01:01:06,069 --> 01:01:06,079
presidents throughout the what's going
 

3871
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:07,670
presidents throughout the what's going
on is something in the environment is

3872
01:01:07,670 --> 01:01:07,680
on is something in the environment is
 

3873
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:09,510
on is something in the environment is
changing and that's that you're seeing

3874
01:01:09,510 --> 01:01:09,520
changing and that's that you're seeing
 

3875
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:11,910
changing and that's that you're seeing
is a change in behavior a easy example

3876
01:01:11,910 --> 01:01:11,920
is a change in behavior a easy example
 

3877
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,190
is a change in behavior a easy example
here is that you know by a lot of

3878
01:01:13,190 --> 01:01:13,200
here is that you know by a lot of
 

3879
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:16,230
here is that you know by a lot of
metrics racism is getting

3880
01:01:16,230 --> 01:01:16,240
metrics racism is getting
 

3881
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:18,230
metrics racism is getting
is becoming less and less of a problem

3882
01:01:18,230 --> 01:01:18,240
is becoming less and less of a problem
 

3883
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,950
is becoming less and less of a problem
um you know the this hard to measure but

3884
01:01:20,950 --> 01:01:20,960
um you know the this hard to measure but
 

3885
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:22,549
um you know the this hard to measure but
there's metrics like you know how upset

3886
01:01:22,549 --> 01:01:22,559
there's metrics like you know how upset
 

3887
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:24,549
there's metrics like you know how upset
would you be if your kid married someone

3888
01:01:24,549 --> 01:01:24,559
would you be if your kid married someone
 

3889
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:26,390
would you be if your kid married someone
of another race

3890
01:01:26,390 --> 01:01:26,400
of another race
 

3891
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:28,309
of another race
and that number is plummeting but racial

3892
01:01:28,309 --> 01:01:28,319
and that number is plummeting but racial
 

3893
01:01:28,319 --> 01:01:30,870
and that number is plummeting but racial
grievance is skyrocketing right there's

3894
01:01:30,870 --> 01:01:30,880
grievance is skyrocketing right there's
 

3895
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:32,470
grievance is skyrocketing right there's
a lot of examples like this so i wanted

3896
01:01:32,470 --> 01:01:32,480
a lot of examples like this so i wanted
 

3897
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:34,069
a lot of examples like this so i wanted
to look around and say and the reason i

3898
01:01:34,069 --> 01:01:34,079
to look around and say and the reason i
 

3899
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:35,349
to look around and say and the reason i
took it on the reason i don't think this

3900
01:01:35,349 --> 01:01:35,359
took it on the reason i don't think this
 

3901
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:37,270
took it on the reason i don't think this
is just an unfortunate trend unpleasant

3902
01:01:37,270 --> 01:01:37,280
is just an unfortunate trend unpleasant
 

3903
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:38,870
is just an unfortunate trend unpleasant
trend that hopefully we come out of is

3904
01:01:38,870 --> 01:01:38,880
trend that hopefully we come out of is
 

3905
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:39,910
trend that hopefully we come out of is
that all this other stuff i like to

3906
01:01:39,910 --> 01:01:39,920
that all this other stuff i like to
 

3907
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:41,990
that all this other stuff i like to
write about all this future stuff right

3908
01:01:41,990 --> 01:01:42,000
write about all this future stuff right
 

3909
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,670
write about all this future stuff right
is this magical i always think of this

3910
01:01:43,670 --> 01:01:43,680
is this magical i always think of this
 

3911
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:45,190
is this magical i always think of this
i'm very optimistic in a lot of ways and

3912
01:01:45,190 --> 01:01:45,200
i'm very optimistic in a lot of ways and
 

3913
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:46,309
i'm very optimistic in a lot of ways and
i think that

3914
01:01:46,309 --> 01:01:46,319
i think that
 

3915
01:01:46,319 --> 01:01:48,549
i think that
our world would be a utopia it would

3916
01:01:48,549 --> 01:01:48,559
our world would be a utopia it would
 

3917
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:50,789
our world would be a utopia it would
seem like actual heaven like whatever

3918
01:01:50,789 --> 01:01:50,799
seem like actual heaven like whatever
 

3919
01:01:50,799 --> 01:01:53,430
seem like actual heaven like whatever
thomas jefferson was picturing as heaven

3920
01:01:53,430 --> 01:01:53,440
thomas jefferson was picturing as heaven
 

3921
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:55,270
thomas jefferson was picturing as heaven
other than maybe the eternal life aspect

3922
01:01:55,270 --> 01:01:55,280
other than maybe the eternal life aspect
 

3923
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:58,150
other than maybe the eternal life aspect
i think that if he came to 2021 u.s it

3924
01:01:58,150 --> 01:01:58,160
i think that if he came to 2021 u.s it
 

3925
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:00,710
i think that if he came to 2021 u.s it
would be better it's cooler than heaven

3926
01:02:00,710 --> 01:02:00,720
would be better it's cooler than heaven
 

3927
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:02,069
would be better it's cooler than heaven
but we live in a place that's cooler

3928
01:02:02,069 --> 01:02:02,079
but we live in a place that's cooler
 

3929
01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:04,549
but we live in a place that's cooler
than 1707 yeah again other than the fact

3930
01:02:04,549 --> 01:02:04,559
than 1707 yeah again other than the fact
 

3931
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:06,470
than 1707 yeah again other than the fact
that we still die now i think the future

3932
01:02:06,470 --> 01:02:06,480
that we still die now i think the future
 

3933
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:08,549
that we still die now i think the future
world actually probably would have

3934
01:02:08,549 --> 01:02:08,559
world actually probably would have
 

3935
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:09,990
world actually probably would have
quote eternal life i don't think anyone

3936
01:02:09,990 --> 01:02:10,000
quote eternal life i don't think anyone
 

3937
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,150
quote eternal life i don't think anyone
wants eternal life actually if people

3938
01:02:12,150 --> 01:02:12,160
wants eternal life actually if people
 

3939
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:14,549
wants eternal life actually if people
think they do eternal is a long time but

3940
01:02:14,549 --> 01:02:14,559
think they do eternal is a long time but
 

3941
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:16,549
think they do eternal is a long time but
i think the true the choice to die when

3942
01:02:16,549 --> 01:02:16,559
i think the true the choice to die when
 

3943
01:02:16,559 --> 01:02:17,990
i think the true the choice to die when
you want maybe we're uploaded maybe

3944
01:02:17,990 --> 01:02:18,000
you want maybe we're uploaded maybe
 

3945
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,430
you want maybe we're uploaded maybe
maybe we can refresh our bodies i don't

3946
01:02:19,430 --> 01:02:19,440
maybe we can refresh our bodies i don't
 

3947
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:21,990
maybe we can refresh our bodies i don't
know what it is but the point is i think

3948
01:02:21,990 --> 01:02:22,000
know what it is but the point is i think
 

3949
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,390
know what it is but the point is i think
about that utopia uh and i do believe

3950
01:02:24,390 --> 01:02:24,400
about that utopia uh and i do believe
 

3951
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:26,069
about that utopia uh and i do believe
that like if we don't botch this we'd be

3952
01:02:26,069 --> 01:02:26,079
that like if we don't botch this we'd be
 

3953
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:27,270
that like if we don't botch this we'd be
heading towards somewhere that would

3954
01:02:27,270 --> 01:02:27,280
heading towards somewhere that would
 

3955
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:29,910
heading towards somewhere that would
seem like heaven maybe in our lifetimes

3956
01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:29,920
seem like heaven maybe in our lifetimes
 

3957
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:31,670
seem like heaven maybe in our lifetimes
of course if we

3958
01:02:31,670 --> 01:02:31,680
of course if we
 

3959
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:33,430
of course if we
if things go wrong now think about the

3960
01:02:33,430 --> 01:02:33,440
if things go wrong now think about the
 

3961
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:34,789
if things go wrong now think about the
trends here

3962
01:02:34,789 --> 01:02:34,799
trends here
 

3963
01:02:34,799 --> 01:02:36,630
trends here
just like the 20th century would seem

3964
01:02:36,630 --> 01:02:36,640
just like the 20th century would seem
 

3965
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:38,390
just like the 20th century would seem
like some magical utopia to someone from

3966
01:02:38,390 --> 01:02:38,400
like some magical utopia to someone from
 

3967
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:40,390
like some magical utopia to someone from
the 16th century

3968
01:02:40,390 --> 01:02:40,400
the 16th century
 

3969
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:41,510
the 16th century
um

3970
01:02:41,510 --> 01:02:41,520
um
 

3971
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:43,670
um
the the bad things in the 20th century

3972
01:02:43,670 --> 01:02:43,680
the the bad things in the 20th century
 

3973
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:45,349
the the bad things in the 20th century
were kind of the worst things

3974
01:02:45,349 --> 01:02:45,359
were kind of the worst things
 

3975
01:02:45,359 --> 01:02:47,589
were kind of the worst things
ever in terms of just absolute magnitude

3976
01:02:47,589 --> 01:02:47,599
ever in terms of just absolute magnitude
 

3977
01:02:47,599 --> 01:02:49,670
ever in terms of just absolute magnitude
you know world war ii you know the

3978
01:02:49,670 --> 01:02:49,680
you know world war ii you know the
 

3979
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:53,510
you know world war ii you know the
biggest genocides ever um you've got uh

3980
01:02:53,510 --> 01:02:53,520
biggest genocides ever um you've got uh
 

3981
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,670
biggest genocides ever um you've got uh
you know maybe climate change if it is

3982
01:02:55,670 --> 01:02:55,680
you know maybe climate change if it is
 

3983
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:57,589
you know maybe climate change if it is
the existential threat that many people

3984
01:02:57,589 --> 01:02:57,599
the existential threat that many people
 

3985
01:02:57,599 --> 01:02:58,870
the existential threat that many people
think it is i mean we never had an

3986
01:02:58,870 --> 01:02:58,880
think it is i mean we never had an
 

3987
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:00,390
think it is i mean we never had an
existential threat on that level before

3988
01:03:00,390 --> 01:03:00,400
existential threat on that level before
 

3989
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:02,390
existential threat on that level before
i mean so the good is getting better and

3990
01:03:02,390 --> 01:03:02,400
i mean so the good is getting better and
 

3991
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:04,309
i mean so the good is getting better and
the bad's getting worse and so what i

3992
01:03:04,309 --> 01:03:04,319
the bad's getting worse and so what i
 

3993
01:03:04,319 --> 01:03:06,069
the bad's getting worse and so what i
think about the future i think of us in

3994
01:03:06,069 --> 01:03:06,079
think about the future i think of us in
 

3995
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:07,349
think about the future i think of us in
some kind of

3996
01:03:07,349 --> 01:03:07,359
some kind of
 

3997
01:03:07,359 --> 01:03:10,789
some kind of
big you know long canoe as a species uh

3998
01:03:10,789 --> 01:03:10,799
big you know long canoe as a species uh
 

3999
01:03:10,799 --> 01:03:14,150
big you know long canoe as a species uh
five million mile long canoe uh each of

4000
01:03:14,150 --> 01:03:14,160
five million mile long canoe uh each of
 

4001
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:15,589
five million mile long canoe uh each of
us sitting in a row we have a we each

4002
01:03:15,589 --> 01:03:15,599
us sitting in a row we have a we each
 

4003
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:16,950
us sitting in a row we have a we each
have one or we can paddle on the left

4004
01:03:16,950 --> 01:03:16,960
have one or we can paddle on the left
 

4005
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:18,309
have one or we can paddle on the left
side of the right side

4006
01:03:18,309 --> 01:03:18,319
side of the right side
 

4007
01:03:18,319 --> 01:03:20,309
side of the right side
and what we know is there's a fork up

4008
01:03:20,309 --> 01:03:20,319
and what we know is there's a fork up
 

4009
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:21,829
and what we know is there's a fork up
there somewhere

4010
01:03:21,829 --> 01:03:21,839
there somewhere
 

4011
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:24,150
there somewhere
and at the river forks

4012
01:03:24,150 --> 01:03:24,160
and at the river forks
 

4013
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:25,990
and at the river forks
and there's a utopia on one side and a

4014
01:03:25,990 --> 01:03:26,000
and there's a utopia on one side and a
 

4015
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,430
and there's a utopia on one side and a
dystopia on the other side and i really

4016
01:03:27,430 --> 01:03:27,440
dystopia on the other side and i really
 

4017
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:28,870
dystopia on the other side and i really
believe that that's we're probably not

4018
01:03:28,870 --> 01:03:28,880
believe that that's we're probably not
 

4019
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:30,870
believe that that's we're probably not
headed for just an okay future it's just

4020
01:03:30,870 --> 01:03:30,880
headed for just an okay future it's just
 

4021
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:32,470
headed for just an okay future it's just
the way tech is exploding like it's

4022
01:03:32,470 --> 01:03:32,480
the way tech is exploding like it's
 

4023
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:33,430
the way tech is exploding like it's
probably gonna be really good or really

4024
01:03:33,430 --> 01:03:33,440
probably gonna be really good or really
 

4025
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:35,190
probably gonna be really good or really
bad the question is which side should we

4026
01:03:35,190 --> 01:03:35,200
bad the question is which side should we
 

4027
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:37,510
bad the question is which side should we
be rowing on we can't see up there right

4028
01:03:37,510 --> 01:03:37,520
be rowing on we can't see up there right
 

4029
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:38,870
be rowing on we can't see up there right
but it really matters so i'm writing all

4030
01:03:38,870 --> 01:03:38,880
but it really matters so i'm writing all
 

4031
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:39,990
but it really matters so i'm writing all
this future stuff and i'm saying none of

4032
01:03:39,990 --> 01:03:40,000
this future stuff and i'm saying none of
 

4033
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,829
this future stuff and i'm saying none of
this matters if we're squabbling our way

4034
01:03:41,829 --> 01:03:41,839
this matters if we're squabbling our way
 

4035
01:03:41,839 --> 01:03:44,230
this matters if we're squabbling our way
into kind of like a civil war right now

4036
01:03:44,230 --> 01:03:44,240
into kind of like a civil war right now
 

4037
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:46,150
into kind of like a civil war right now
so what's going on so it's a really

4038
01:03:46,150 --> 01:03:46,160
so what's going on so it's a really
 

4039
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:48,470
so what's going on so it's a really
important problem to solve

4040
01:03:48,470 --> 01:03:48,480
important problem to solve
 

4041
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:50,789
important problem to solve
what what are your your sources of hope

4042
01:03:50,789 --> 01:03:50,799
what what are your your sources of hope
 

4043
01:03:50,799 --> 01:03:51,670
what what are your your sources of hope
in this

4044
01:03:51,670 --> 01:03:51,680
in this
 

4045
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:54,789
in this
so like how do you steer the the canoe

4046
01:03:54,789 --> 01:03:54,799
so like how do you steer the the canoe
 

4047
01:03:54,799 --> 01:03:56,390
so like how do you steer the the canoe
one of my big sources of hope and this

4048
01:03:56,390 --> 01:03:56,400
one of my big sources of hope and this
 

4049
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:57,990
one of my big sources of hope and this
is my i thing my answer to what i

4050
01:03:57,990 --> 01:03:58,000
is my i thing my answer to what i
 

4051
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,750
is my i thing my answer to what i
changed my mind on

4052
01:03:59,750 --> 01:03:59,760
changed my mind on
 

4053
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:01,829
changed my mind on
is i i think i always knew this but i

4054
01:04:01,829 --> 01:04:01,839
is i i think i always knew this but i
 

4055
01:04:01,839 --> 01:04:03,589
is i i think i always knew this but i
for it's easy to forget it

4056
01:04:03,589 --> 01:04:03,599
for it's easy to forget it
 

4057
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:05,029
for it's easy to forget it
our primitive brain does not remember

4058
01:04:05,029 --> 01:04:05,039
our primitive brain does not remember
 

4059
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:06,549
our primitive brain does not remember
this fact which is that i don't think

4060
01:04:06,549 --> 01:04:06,559
this fact which is that i don't think
 

4061
01:04:06,559 --> 01:04:07,910
this fact which is that i don't think
there are

4062
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:07,920
there are
 

4063
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:08,870
there are
um

4064
01:04:08,870 --> 01:04:08,880
um
 

4065
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:11,029
um
very many bad people

4066
01:04:11,029 --> 01:04:11,039
very many bad people
 

4067
01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:12,630
very many bad people
now you say bad you know there are there

4068
01:04:12,630 --> 01:04:12,640
now you say bad you know there are there
 

4069
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:14,309
now you say bad you know there are there
selfish people most of us i think if you

4070
01:04:14,309 --> 01:04:14,319
selfish people most of us i think if you
 

4071
01:04:14,319 --> 01:04:16,069
selfish people most of us i think if you
know i think that if you think of people

4072
01:04:16,069 --> 01:04:16,079
know i think that if you think of people
 

4073
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:18,069
know i think that if you think of people
uh if you know

4074
01:04:18,069 --> 01:04:18,079
uh if you know
 

4075
01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:19,670
uh if you know
there's there's you know digital

4076
01:04:19,670 --> 01:04:19,680
there's there's you know digital
 

4077
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:21,430
there's there's you know digital
languages ones and zeros

4078
01:04:21,430 --> 01:04:21,440
languages ones and zeros
 

4079
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:23,190
languages ones and zeros
and our primitive brain very quickly can

4080
01:04:23,190 --> 01:04:23,200
and our primitive brain very quickly can
 

4081
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:24,470
and our primitive brain very quickly can
get into the land where everyone's a one

4082
01:04:24,470 --> 01:04:24,480
get into the land where everyone's a one
 

4083
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:26,069
get into the land where everyone's a one
or a zero our tribe we're all ones you

4084
01:04:26,069 --> 01:04:26,079
or a zero our tribe we're all ones you
 

4085
01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:27,829
or a zero our tribe we're all ones you
know we're perfect i'm perfect my family

is that other family it's that other
 

4089
01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:31,349
is that other family it's that other
tribe there are zeros and you dehumanize

4090
01:04:31,349 --> 01:04:31,359
tribe there are zeros and you dehumanize
 

4091
01:04:31,359 --> 01:04:32,710
tribe there are zeros and you dehumanize
them right these people's these people

4092
01:04:32,710 --> 01:04:32,720
them right these people's these people
 

4093
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:35,190
them right these people's these people
are awful so d you know zero is not a

4094
01:04:35,190 --> 01:04:35,200
are awful so d you know zero is not a
 

4095
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:36,950
are awful so d you know zero is not a

know we it felt so good to just give a

4250
01:06:57,510 --> 01:06:57,520
know we it felt so good to just give a
 

4251
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:59,589
know we it felt so good to just give a
huge cheer to this guy we hate because

4252
01:06:59,589 --> 01:06:59,599
huge cheer to this guy we hate because
 

4253
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:01,430
huge cheer to this guy we hate because
it's like this moment of like a little

4254
01:07:01,430 --> 01:07:01,440
it's like this moment of like a little
 

4255
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:02,789
it's like this moment of like a little
fist pound being like of course we all

4256
01:07:02,789 --> 01:07:02,799
fist pound being like of course we all
 

4257
01:07:02,799 --> 01:07:04,390
fist pound being like of course we all
actually love each other and i think

4258
01:07:04,390 --> 01:07:04,400
actually love each other and i think
 

4259
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:06,470
actually love each other and i think
there's so much of that yeah and so the

4260
01:07:06,470 --> 01:07:06,480
there's so much of that yeah and so the
 

4261
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:07,990
there's so much of that yeah and so the
thing that i think i've come around on

4262
01:07:07,990 --> 01:07:08,000
thing that i think i've come around on
 

4263
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,670
thing that i think i've come around on
is i just i don't i think that we are in

4264
01:07:09,670 --> 01:07:09,680
is i just i don't i think that we are in
 

4265
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:12,230
is i just i don't i think that we are in
an environment that's bringing out

4266
01:07:12,230 --> 01:07:12,240
an environment that's bringing out
 

4267
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:13,990
an environment that's bringing out
really bad stuff i don't think it's if i

4268
01:07:13,990 --> 01:07:14,000
really bad stuff i don't think it's if i
 

4269
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,670
really bad stuff i don't think it's if i
thought it was the people

4270
01:07:15,670 --> 01:07:15,680
thought it was the people
 

4271
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:16,789
thought it was the people
i would be more hopeful like if i

4272
01:07:16,789 --> 01:07:16,799
i would be more hopeful like if i
 

4273
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:17,990
i would be more hopeful like if i
thought it was human nature i'd be you

4274
01:07:17,990 --> 01:07:18,000
thought it was human nature i'd be you
 

4275
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,789
thought it was human nature i'd be you
know i'd be more upset it's the two

4276
01:07:20,789 --> 01:07:20,799
know i'd be more upset it's the two
 

4277
01:07:20,799 --> 01:07:23,190
know i'd be more upset it's the two
independent variables here um or that

4278
01:07:23,190 --> 01:07:23,200
independent variables here um or that
 

4279
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:24,549
independent variables here um or that
there's a fixed variable there's a

4280
01:07:24,549 --> 01:07:24,559
there's a fixed variable there's a
 

4281
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:25,750
there's a fixed variable there's a
constant which is human nature and

4282
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:25,760
constant which is human nature and
 

4283
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:26,789
constant which is human nature and
there's the independent variable

4284
01:07:26,789 --> 01:07:26,799
there's the independent variable
 

4285
01:07:26,799 --> 01:07:28,390
there's the independent variable
environment and the behavior is the

4286
01:07:28,390 --> 01:07:28,400
environment and the behavior is the
 

4287
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:30,309
environment and the behavior is the
dependent variable

4288
01:07:30,309 --> 01:07:30,319
dependent variable
 

4289
01:07:30,319 --> 01:07:31,910
dependent variable
i like that the thing that i think is

4290
01:07:31,910 --> 01:07:31,920
i like that the thing that i think is
 

4291
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:33,910
i like that the thing that i think is
bad is the independent variable the

4292
01:07:33,910 --> 01:07:33,920
bad is the independent variable the
 

4293
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:35,589
bad is the independent variable the
environment which means i think we can

4294
01:07:35,589 --> 01:07:35,599
environment which means i think we can
 

4295
01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:36,789
environment which means i think we can
the environment can get better and

4296
01:07:36,789 --> 01:07:36,799
the environment can get better and
 

4297
01:07:36,799 --> 01:07:37,910
the environment can get better and
there's a lot of things i can go into

4298
01:07:37,910 --> 01:07:37,920
there's a lot of things i can go into
 

4299
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:39,670
there's a lot of things i can go into
about why the environment i think is bad

4300
01:07:39,670 --> 01:07:39,680
about why the environment i think is bad
 

4301
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:41,670
about why the environment i think is bad
but i have hope because i think the

4302
01:07:41,670 --> 01:07:41,680
but i have hope because i think the
 

4303
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:42,950
but i have hope because i think the
thing that's bad for us is something

4304
01:07:42,950 --> 01:07:42,960
thing that's bad for us is something
 

4305
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:44,390
thing that's bad for us is something
that can change

4306
01:07:44,390 --> 01:07:44,400
that can change
 

4307
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:46,870
that can change
the first principles idea here is that

4308
01:07:46,870 --> 01:07:46,880
the first principles idea here is that
 

4309
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:49,430
the first principles idea here is that
most people have the capacity to be uh a

4310
01:07:49,430 --> 01:07:49,440
most people have the capacity to be uh a
 

4311
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:51,510
most people have the capacity to be uh a
0.7 to a 0.9

4312
01:07:51,510 --> 01:07:51,520
0.7 to a 0.9
 

4313
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:53,349
0.7 to a 0.9
if the environment

4314
01:07:53,349 --> 01:07:53,359
if the environment
 

4315
01:07:53,359 --> 01:07:55,029
if the environment
is uh

4316
01:07:55,029 --> 01:07:55,039
is uh
 

4317
01:07:55,039 --> 01:07:57,910
is uh
is properly calibrated with incentives i

4318
01:07:57,910 --> 01:07:57,920
is properly calibrated with incentives i
 

4319
01:07:57,920 --> 01:07:58,950
is properly calibrated with incentives i
think that well i think that i think

4320
01:07:58,950 --> 01:07:58,960
think that well i think that i think
 

4321
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:00,710
think that well i think that i think
maybe if we're all yeah if we're all

4322
01:08:00,710 --> 01:08:00,720
maybe if we're all yeah if we're all
 

4323
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:03,430
maybe if we're all yeah if we're all
point fives i think that that uh that

4324
01:08:03,430 --> 01:08:03,440
point fives i think that that uh that
 

4325
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:05,109
point fives i think that that uh that
environments can bring out our good side

4326
01:08:05,109 --> 01:08:05,119
environments can bring out our good side
 

4327
01:08:05,119 --> 01:08:06,630
environments can bring out our good side
you know yeah so maybe we're all on uh

4328
01:08:06,630 --> 01:08:06,640
you know yeah so maybe we're all on uh
 

4329
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:08,789
you know yeah so maybe we're all on uh
some kind of distribution

4330
01:08:08,789 --> 01:08:08,799
some kind of distribution
 

4331
01:08:08,799 --> 01:08:09,750
some kind of distribution
and

4332
01:08:09,750 --> 01:08:09,760
and
 

4333
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:11,270
and
the right environment can yes can bring

4334
01:08:11,270 --> 01:08:11,280
the right environment can yes can bring
 

4335
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:13,190
the right environment can yes can bring
out our higher sides and i think a lot

4336
01:08:13,190 --> 01:08:13,200
out our higher sides and i think a lot
 

4337
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:14,950
out our higher sides and i think a lot
of in a lot of ways you could say it has

4338
01:08:14,950 --> 01:08:14,960
of in a lot of ways you could say it has
 

4339
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:16,390
of in a lot of ways you could say it has
i mean

4340
01:08:16,390 --> 01:08:16,400
i mean
 

4341
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:18,870
i mean
the us environment we take for granted

4342
01:08:18,870 --> 01:08:18,880
the us environment we take for granted
 

4343
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:21,349
the us environment we take for granted
how the liberal laws and liberal

4344
01:08:21,349 --> 01:08:21,359
how the liberal laws and liberal
 

4345
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:22,870
how the liberal laws and liberal
environment that we live in

4346
01:08:22,870 --> 01:08:22,880
environment that we live in
 

4347
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:24,709
environment that we live in
i mean like

4348
01:08:24,709 --> 01:08:24,719
i mean like
 

4349
01:08:24,719 --> 01:08:26,870
i mean like
in new york city right if you walk down

4350
01:08:26,870 --> 01:08:26,880
in new york city right if you walk down
 

4351
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:29,189
in new york city right if you walk down
the street and you like assault someone

4352
01:08:29,189 --> 01:08:29,199
the street and you like assault someone
 

4353
01:08:29,199 --> 01:08:30,390
the street and you like assault someone
hey if anyone sees you they're probably

4354
01:08:30,390 --> 01:08:30,400
hey if anyone sees you they're probably
 

4355
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:31,510
hey if anyone sees you they're probably
going to yell you might get your ass

4356
01:08:31,510 --> 01:08:31,520
going to yell you might get your ass
 

4357
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:32,950
going to yell you might get your ass
kicked by someone for doing that you

4358
01:08:32,950 --> 01:08:32,960
kicked by someone for doing that you
 

4359
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:35,510
kicked by someone for doing that you
also might uh end up in jail um you know

4360
01:08:35,510 --> 01:08:35,520
also might uh end up in jail um you know
 

4361
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:37,349
also might uh end up in jail um you know
if it's security cameras and there's

4362
01:08:37,349 --> 01:08:37,359
if it's security cameras and there's
 

4363
01:08:37,359 --> 01:08:38,630
if it's security cameras and there's
just norms you know we're all trained

4364
01:08:38,630 --> 01:08:38,640
just norms you know we're all trained
 

4365
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:40,470
just norms you know we're all trained
that's what awful people do right so

4366
01:08:40,470 --> 01:08:40,480
that's what awful people do right so
 

4367
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:42,070
that's what awful people do right so
there's it's not that human nature

4368
01:08:42,070 --> 01:08:42,080
there's it's not that human nature
 

4369
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:44,149
there's it's not that human nature
doesn't have it in it to to be like that

4370
01:08:44,149 --> 01:08:44,159
doesn't have it in it to to be like that
 

4371
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:46,390
doesn't have it in it to to be like that
it's that this environment we're in has

4372
01:08:46,390 --> 01:08:46,400
it's that this environment we're in has
 

4373
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:48,470
it's that this environment we're in has
has made that a much much much smaller

4374
01:08:48,470 --> 01:08:48,480
has made that a much much much smaller
 

4375
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:50,550
has made that a much much much smaller
experience for people there's so many

4376
01:08:50,550 --> 01:08:50,560
experience for people there's so many
 

4377
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:51,990
experience for people there's so many
examples like that where it's like man

4378
01:08:51,990 --> 01:08:52,000
examples like that where it's like man
 

4379
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,749
examples like that where it's like man
you don't realize how much of the worst

4380
01:08:53,749 --> 01:08:53,759
you don't realize how much of the worst
 

4381
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:55,510
you don't realize how much of the worst
human nature is is contained by our

4382
01:08:55,510 --> 01:08:55,520
human nature is is contained by our
 

4383
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:58,070
human nature is is contained by our
environment and um but i think that you

4384
01:08:58,070 --> 01:08:58,080
environment and um but i think that you
 

4385
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:00,229
environment and um but i think that you
know rapidly changing environment which

4386
01:09:00,229 --> 01:09:00,239
know rapidly changing environment which
 

4387
01:09:00,239 --> 01:09:01,829
know rapidly changing environment which
is what we have right now social media

4388
01:09:01,829 --> 01:09:01,839
is what we have right now social media
 

4389
01:09:01,839 --> 01:09:03,590
is what we have right now social media
starts i mean what a seismic change to

4390
01:09:03,590 --> 01:09:03,600
starts i mean what a seismic change to
 

4391
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:04,950
starts i mean what a seismic change to
the environment there's a lot of

4392
01:09:04,950 --> 01:09:04,960
the environment there's a lot of
 

4393
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:06,390
the environment there's a lot of
examples like that rapidly changing

4394
01:09:06,390 --> 01:09:06,400
examples like that rapidly changing
 

4395
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:08,149
examples like that rapidly changing
environment can create rapidly changing

4396
01:09:08,149 --> 01:09:08,159
environment can create rapidly changing
 

4397
01:09:08,159 --> 01:09:09,189
environment can create rapidly changing
behavior

4398
01:09:09,189 --> 01:09:09,199
behavior
 

4399
01:09:09,199 --> 01:09:11,910
behavior
and wisdom sometimes can't keep up and

4400
01:09:11,910 --> 01:09:11,920
and wisdom sometimes can't keep up and
 

4401
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:14,550
and wisdom sometimes can't keep up and
so we you know uh we can we can really

4402
01:09:14,550 --> 01:09:14,560
so we you know uh we can we can really
 

4403
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:16,229
so we you know uh we can we can really

done my deep dive on this yeah but it's

4422
01:09:38,149 --> 01:09:38,159
done my deep dive on this yeah but it's
 

4423
01:09:38,159 --> 01:09:38,870
done my deep dive on this yeah but it's
here's

4424
01:09:38,870 --> 01:09:38,880
here's
 

4425
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:40,309
here's
in this case this is this is reasoning

4426
01:09:40,309 --> 01:09:40,319
in this case this is this is reasoning
 

4427
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:42,550
in this case this is this is reasoning
by analogy here

4428
01:09:42,550 --> 01:09:42,560
by analogy here
 

4429
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:44,309
by analogy here
the amount of really smart people i

4430
01:09:44,309 --> 01:09:44,319
the amount of really smart people i
 

4431
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:46,789
the amount of really smart people i

good option it's obviously emission free

4436
01:09:50,950 --> 01:09:50,960
good option it's obviously emission free
 

4437
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:52,950
good option it's obviously emission free
but you know the the concerns about

4438
01:09:52,950 --> 01:09:52,960
but you know the the concerns about
 

4439
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:54,550
but you know the the concerns about
meltdowns and wastes they see that

4440
01:09:54,550 --> 01:09:54,560
meltdowns and wastes they see that
 

4441
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:56,709
meltdowns and wastes they see that
they're completely overblown

4442
01:09:56,709 --> 01:09:56,719
they're completely overblown
 

4443
01:09:56,719 --> 01:09:57,510
they're completely overblown
so

4444
01:09:57,510 --> 01:09:57,520
so
 

4445
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:59,590
so

judging from those people secondary

i haven't done my own deep dive yet but

4452
01:10:04,229 --> 01:10:04,239
i haven't done my own deep dive yet but
 

4453
01:10:04,239 --> 01:10:06,470
i haven't done my own deep dive yet but
it does seem like a little bit odd

4454
01:10:06,470 --> 01:10:06,480
it does seem like a little bit odd
 

4455
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:08,630
it does seem like a little bit odd
that you've got people who are so

4456
01:10:08,630 --> 01:10:08,640
that you've got people who are so
 

4457
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:10,550
that you've got people who are so
concerned about climate change

4458

concerned about climate change
 

4459
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:11,830
concerned about climate change
um

4460
01:10:11,830 --> 01:10:11,840
um
 

4461
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:13,510
um
who have it seems like it's kind of an

4462
01:10:13,510 --> 01:10:13,520
who have it seems like it's kind of an
 

4463
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:15,430
who have it seems like it's kind of an

4464
01:10:15,430 --> 01:10:15,440
ideology
 

4465
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:17,270
ideology
where nuclear power doesn't fit rather

4466
01:10:17,270 --> 01:10:17,280
where nuclear power doesn't fit rather
 

4467
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:19,430
where nuclear power doesn't fit rather
than rational you know fear of climate

4468
01:10:19,430 --> 01:10:19,440

power it just yeah i i personally am

4472
01:10:24,310 --> 01:10:24,320
power it just yeah i i personally am
 

4473
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:26,470

uncomfortably reasoning about analogy

4474
01:10:26,470 --> 01:10:26,480
uncomfortably reasoning about analogy
 

4475
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:28,390
uncomfortably reasoning about analogy
with climate change i've actually have

4476
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:28,400
with climate change i've actually have
 

4477
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:30,390
with climate change i've actually have
not done a deep dive me neither because

4478
01:10:30,390 --> 01:10:30,400
not done a deep dive me neither because
 

4479
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:33,189
not done a deep dive me neither because
it's so uh man it seems like a deep dive

4480
01:10:33,189 --> 01:10:33,199
it's so uh man it seems like a deep dive
 

4481
01:10:33,199 --> 01:10:34,709
it's so uh man it seems like a deep dive
and yeah

4482
01:10:34,709 --> 01:10:34,719
and yeah
 

4483
01:10:34,719 --> 01:10:37,110
and yeah
and uh my reasoning by analogy there

4484
01:10:37,110 --> 01:10:37,120
and uh my reasoning by analogy there
 

4485
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:39,270
and uh my reasoning by analogy there
currently has me thinking it's a

4486
01:10:39,270 --> 01:10:39,280
currently has me thinking it's a
 

4487
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:40,950
currently has me thinking it's a
truly existential thing but feeling

01:10:40,950 --> 01:10:40,960
truly existential thing but feeling

hopeful so let me this is me speaking

4490
01:10:44,229 --> 01:10:44,239
hopeful so let me this is me speaking
 

4491
01:10:44,239 --> 01:10:45,750
hopeful so let me this is me speaking
and this is speaking from a person who's

4492
01:10:45,750 --> 01:10:45,760
and this is speaking from a person who's
 

4493
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:48,310
and this is speaking from a person who's
not done the deep dive

4494
01:10:48,310 --> 01:10:48,320
not done the deep dive
 

4495
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:51,189
not done the deep dive
i'm a little suspicious of the amount of

4496
01:10:51,189 --> 01:10:51,199
i'm a little suspicious of the amount of
 

4497
01:10:51,199 --> 01:10:53,270
i'm a little suspicious of the amount of
fear-mongering going on i've especially

4498
01:10:53,270 --> 01:10:53,280
fear-mongering going on i've especially
 

4499
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:55,030
fear-mongering going on i've especially
over the past couple years i've gotten

4500
01:10:55,030 --> 01:10:55,040
over the past couple years i've gotten
 

4501
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:57,270
over the past couple years i've gotten
uncomfortable with fear-mongering in all

4502
01:10:57,270 --> 01:10:57,280
uncomfortable with fear-mongering in all
 

4503
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:59,030
uncomfortable with fear-mongering in all
walks of life

4504
01:10:59,030 --> 01:10:59,040
walks of life
 

4505
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:01,350
walks of life
there's way too many people interested

4506
01:11:01,350 --> 01:11:01,360
there's way too many people interested
 

4507
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:04,070
there's way too many people interested
in manipulating the populace with fear

4508
01:11:04,070 --> 01:11:04,080
in manipulating the populace with fear
 

4509
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:05,990
in manipulating the populace with fear
and so i don't like it i should probably

4510
01:11:05,990 --> 01:11:06,000
and so i don't like it i should probably
 

4511
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,990
and so i don't like it i should probably
do a deep dive because to me it's at the

4512
01:11:07,990 --> 01:11:08,000
do a deep dive because to me it's at the
 

4513
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:11,350
do a deep dive because to me it's at the
well the the big problem

4514
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:11,360
well the the big problem
 

4515
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:13,189
well the the big problem
with the opposition to climate change or

4516
01:11:13,189 --> 01:11:13,199
with the opposition to climate change or
 

4517
01:11:13,199 --> 01:11:16,390
with the opposition to climate change or
whatever the fear-mongering is that

4518
01:11:16,390 --> 01:11:16,400
whatever the fear-mongering is that
 

4519
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:18,709
whatever the fear-mongering is that
it also grows the skepticism in science

4520
01:11:18,709 --> 01:11:18,719
it also grows the skepticism in science
 

4521
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:21,750
it also grows the skepticism in science
broadly it's like and that so i need to

4522
01:11:21,750 --> 01:11:21,760
broadly it's like and that so i need to
 

4523
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:23,750
broadly it's like and that so i need to
make sure i do that deep dive i have

4524
01:11:23,750 --> 01:11:23,760
make sure i do that deep dive i have
 

4525
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:26,470
make sure i do that deep dive i have
listened to a few folks who kind of

4526
01:11:26,470 --> 01:11:26,480
listened to a few folks who kind of
 

4527
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:27,910
listened to a few folks who kind of
criticize the fear-mongering and all

4528
01:11:27,910 --> 01:11:27,920
criticize the fear-mongering and all
 

4529
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:29,669
criticize the fear-mongering and all
those kinds of things but they're few

4530
01:11:29,669 --> 01:11:29,679
those kinds of things but they're few
 

4531
01:11:29,679 --> 01:11:32,070
those kinds of things but they're few
and far between and so it's like

4532
01:11:32,070 --> 01:11:32,080
and far between and so it's like
 

4533
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:34,070
and far between and so it's like
all right what is the truth here and it

4534
01:11:34,070 --> 01:11:34,080
all right what is the truth here and it
 

4535
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:36,149
all right what is the truth here and it
feels lazy but it also feels like it's

4536
01:11:36,149 --> 01:11:36,159
feels lazy but it also feels like it's
 

4537
01:11:36,159 --> 01:11:38,390
feels lazy but it also feels like it's
hard to get to the

4538
01:11:38,390 --> 01:11:38,400
hard to get to the
 

4539
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:41,030
hard to get to the
like there's a lot of kind of activists

4540
01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:41,040
like there's a lot of kind of activists
 

4541
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:43,030

01:12:06,470 --> 01:12:06,480
see really great deep analysis of what
 

4563
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:09,510
see really great deep analysis of what
that looks like in 10 20 30 years

4564
01:12:09,510 --> 01:12:09,520
that looks like in 10 20 30 years
 

4565
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:12,390
that looks like in 10 20 30 years
raising rising sea levels

4566
01:12:12,390 --> 01:12:12,400
raising rising sea levels
 

4567
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:15,110
raising rising sea levels
what are the models of

4568
01:12:15,110 --> 01:12:15,120
what are the models of
 

4569
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:17,510
what are the models of
how that changes human behavior society

4570
01:12:17,510 --> 01:12:17,520
how that changes human behavior society
 

4571
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:19,270
how that changes human behavior society
what are the things that happen

4572
01:12:19,270 --> 01:12:19,280
what are the things that happen
 

4573
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:20,950
what are the things that happen
there's going to be constraints on the

4574
01:12:20,950 --> 01:12:20,960
there's going to be constraints on the
 

4575
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:22,229
there's going to be constraints on the
resources and people are gonna have to

4576
01:12:22,229 --> 01:12:22,239
resources and people are gonna have to
 

4577
01:12:22,239 --> 01:12:24,709
resources and people are gonna have to
move around this is happening gradually

4578
01:12:24,709 --> 01:12:24,719
move around this is happening gradually
 

4579
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:26,550
move around this is happening gradually
are we gonna be able to respond to this

4580
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:26,560
are we gonna be able to respond to this
 

4581
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:27,910
are we gonna be able to respond to this
how would we respond to this what are

4582
01:12:27,910 --> 01:12:27,920
how would we respond to this what are
 

4583
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:29,910
how would we respond to this what are
the best ma like what are the best

4584
01:12:29,910 --> 01:12:29,920
the best ma like what are the best
 

4585
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:32,310
the best ma like what are the best
models for how everything goes wrong

4586
01:12:32,310 --> 01:12:32,320
models for how everything goes wrong
 

4587
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:35,590
models for how everything goes wrong
again i was uh this is a question i keep

4588
01:12:35,590 --> 01:12:35,600
again i was uh this is a question i keep
 

4589
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:37,830
again i was uh this is a question i keep
starting to ask myself without doing any

4590
01:12:37,830 --> 01:12:37,840
starting to ask myself without doing any
 

4591
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:41,110
starting to ask myself without doing any
research uh with like motivating myself

4592
01:12:41,110 --> 01:12:41,120
research uh with like motivating myself
 

4593
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:43,669
research uh with like motivating myself
to get up to the this deep dive that i

4594
01:12:43,669 --> 01:12:43,679
to get up to the this deep dive that i
 

4595
01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:45,110
to get up to the this deep dive that i
feel is deep

4596
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:45,120
feel is deep
 

4597
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:47,030
feel is deep
just watching people not do a great job

4598
01:12:47,030 --> 01:12:47,040
just watching people not do a great job
 

4599
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:48,229
just watching people not do a great job
with that kind of modeling with the

4600
01:12:48,229 --> 01:12:48,239
with that kind of modeling with the
 

4601
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:51,270
with that kind of modeling with the
pandemic and so sort of being caught off

4602
01:12:51,270 --> 01:12:51,280
pandemic and so sort of being caught off
 

4603
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:53,430
pandemic and so sort of being caught off
guard and wondering okay if we're not

4604
01:12:53,430 --> 01:12:53,440
guard and wondering okay if we're not
 

4605
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:55,510
guard and wondering okay if we're not
good with this pandemic how are we going

4606
01:12:55,510 --> 01:12:55,520
good with this pandemic how are we going
 

4607
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:57,350
good with this pandemic how are we going
to respond to other kinds of tragedies

4608
01:12:57,350 --> 01:12:57,360
to respond to other kinds of tragedies
 

4609
01:12:57,360 --> 01:12:58,950
to respond to other kinds of tragedies
well this so this is part of why i wrote

4610
01:12:58,950 --> 01:12:58,960
well this so this is part of why i wrote
 

4611
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:00,229
well this so this is part of why i wrote
the book because i said

4612
01:13:00,229 --> 01:13:00,239
the book because i said
 

4613
01:13:00,239 --> 01:13:02,790
the book because i said
we're going to have

4614
01:13:02,790 --> 01:13:02,800
we're going to have
 

4615
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,950
we're going to have
more and more of these like yeah big

4616
01:13:04,950 --> 01:13:04,960
more and more of these like yeah big
 

4617
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:06,630
more and more of these like yeah big
collective what should we do here

4618
01:13:06,630 --> 01:13:06,640
collective what should we do here
 

4619
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:08,550
collective what should we do here
situations you know whether it's how

4620
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:08,560
situations you know whether it's how
 

4621
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:09,830
situations you know whether it's how
about when you know uh we're probably

4622
01:13:09,830 --> 01:13:09,840
about when you know uh we're probably
 

4623
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:11,430
about when you know uh we're probably
not that far away from people being able

4624
01:13:11,430 --> 01:13:11,440
not that far away from people being able
 

4625
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:12,149
not that far away from people being able
to

4626
01:13:12,149 --> 01:13:12,159
to
 

4627
01:13:12,159 --> 01:13:14,470
to
um go and decide the iq of their kid or

4628
01:13:14,470 --> 01:13:14,480
um go and decide the iq of their kid or
 

4629
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:15,830
um go and decide the iq of their kid or
like you know make a bunch of embryos

4630
01:13:15,830 --> 01:13:15,840
like you know make a bunch of embryos
 

4631
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:17,430
like you know make a bunch of embryos
and actually you know you know pick the

4632
01:13:17,430 --> 01:13:17,440
and actually you know you know pick the
 

4633
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:19,430
and actually you know you know pick the
high highest like you can possibly go

4634
01:13:19,430 --> 01:13:19,440
high highest like you can possibly go
 

4635
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:21,669
high highest like you can possibly go
wrong yeah and also like imagine the

4636
01:13:21,669 --> 01:13:21,679
wrong yeah and also like imagine the
 

4637
01:13:21,679 --> 01:13:23,510
wrong yeah and also like imagine the
political sides of that and like that's

4638
01:13:23,510 --> 01:13:23,520
political sides of that and like that's
 

4639
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:24,950
political sides of that and like that's
something only wealthy people can afford

4640
01:13:24,950 --> 01:13:24,960
something only wealthy people can afford
 

4641
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:27,110
something only wealthy people can afford
at first and just a nightmare right

4642
01:13:27,110 --> 01:13:27,120
at first and just a nightmare right
 

4643
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:28,310
at first and just a nightmare right
we need to be able to have our wits

4644
01:13:28,310 --> 01:13:28,320
we need to be able to have our wits
 

4645
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:30,149
we need to be able to have our wits
about us as a species where we can

4646
01:13:30,149 --> 01:13:30,159
about us as a species where we can
 

4647
01:13:30,159 --> 01:13:32,950
about us as a species where we can
actually get into a topic like that and

4648
01:13:32,950 --> 01:13:32,960
actually get into a topic like that and
 

4649
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:34,630
actually get into a topic like that and
and come up with where the collective

4650
01:13:34,630 --> 01:13:34,640
and come up with where the collective
 

4651
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:36,550
and come up with where the collective
brain can be smart

4652
01:13:36,550 --> 01:13:36,560
brain can be smart
 

4653
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:39,270
brain can be smart
i think that there are certain topics

4654
01:13:39,270 --> 01:13:39,280
i think that there are certain topics
 

4655
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:40,630
i think that there are certain topics
where i think of i think of this and

4656
01:13:40,630 --> 01:13:40,640
where i think of i think of this and
 

4657
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:42,229
where i think of i think of this and
this is again another simplistic model

4658
01:13:42,229 --> 01:13:42,239
this is again another simplistic model
 

4659
01:13:42,239 --> 01:13:43,430
this is again another simplistic model
but i think it works is that there's a

4660
01:13:43,430 --> 01:13:43,440
but i think it works is that there's a
 

4661
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:45,030
but i think it works is that there's a
higher mind and a primitive mind right

4662
01:13:45,030 --> 01:13:45,040
higher mind and a primitive mind right
 

4663
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:47,030
higher mind and a primitive mind right
you can you know in your head

4664
01:13:47,030 --> 01:13:47,040
you can you know in your head
 

4665
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:49,110
you can you know in your head
and these team up with others so when

4666
01:13:49,110 --> 01:13:49,120
and these team up with others so when
 

4667
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:50,870
and these team up with others so when
the higher minds are in a higher mind is

4668
01:13:50,870 --> 01:13:50,880
the higher minds are in a higher mind is
 

4669
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:52,950
the higher minds are in a higher mind is
is more rational and puts out ideas that

4670
01:13:52,950 --> 01:13:52,960
is more rational and puts out ideas that
 

4671
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:54,870
is more rational and puts out ideas that
it's not attached to and so it can arg

4672
01:13:54,870 --> 01:13:54,880
it's not attached to and so it can arg
 

4673
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:56,390
it's not attached to and so it can arg
it can change its mind easily because

4674
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:56,400
it can change its mind easily because
 

4675
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:58,070
it can change its mind easily because
it's just an idea and and the higher

4676
01:13:58,070 --> 01:13:58,080
it's just an idea and and the higher
 

4677
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:00,709
it's just an idea and and the higher
mind can uh get criticized their ideas

4678
01:14:00,709 --> 01:14:00,719
mind can uh get criticized their ideas
 

4679
01:14:00,719 --> 01:14:02,709
mind can uh get criticized their ideas
can get criticized and it's no big deal

4680
01:14:02,709 --> 01:14:02,719
can get criticized and it's no big deal
 

4681
01:14:02,719 --> 01:14:04,870
can get criticized and it's no big deal
and so when the higher minds team up

4682
01:14:04,870 --> 01:14:04,880
and so when the higher minds team up
 

4683
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:06,310
and so when the higher minds team up
it's like all these people in the room

4684
01:14:06,310 --> 01:14:06,320
it's like all these people in the room
 

4685
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:07,750
it's like all these people in the room
like throwing out ideas and kicking them

4686
01:14:07,750 --> 01:14:07,760
like throwing out ideas and kicking them
 

4687
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:09,270
like throwing out ideas and kicking them
and and one idea goes out and everyone

4688
01:14:09,270 --> 01:14:09,280
and and one idea goes out and everyone
 

4689
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:10,550
and and one idea goes out and everyone
criticizes it which is like you know

4690
01:14:10,550 --> 01:14:10,560
criticizes it which is like you know
 

4691
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:12,149
criticizes it which is like you know
shooting bows and arrows at it and the

4692
01:14:12,149 --> 01:14:12,159
shooting bows and arrows at it and the
 

4693
01:14:12,159 --> 01:14:14,070
shooting bows and arrows at it and the
the truth the true idea is you know the

4694
01:14:14,070 --> 01:14:14,080
the truth the true idea is you know the
 

4695
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:15,910
the truth the true idea is you know the
boat the arrows bounce off and it's okay

4696
01:14:15,910 --> 01:14:15,920
boat the arrows bounce off and it's okay
 

4697
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:17,910
boat the arrows bounce off and it's okay
it rises up and the other ones get shot

4698
01:14:17,910 --> 01:14:17,920
it rises up and the other ones get shot
 

4699
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:19,430
it rises up and the other ones get shot
down so it's this incredible system this

4700
01:14:19,430 --> 01:14:19,440
down so it's this incredible system this
 

4701
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:21,189
down so it's this incredible system this
is what you know this is what a good

4702
01:14:21,189 --> 01:14:21,199
is what you know this is what a good
 

4703
01:14:21,199 --> 01:14:22,630
is what you know this is what a good
science institution is is you know

4704
01:14:22,630 --> 01:14:22,640
science institution is is you know
 

4705
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:24,390
science institution is is you know
someone puts out a thing criticism

4706
01:14:24,390 --> 01:14:24,400
someone puts out a thing criticism
 

4707
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:26,390
someone puts out a thing criticism
arrows come at it and you know most of

4708
01:14:26,390 --> 01:14:26,400
arrows come at it and you know most of
 

4709
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:28,390
arrows come at it and you know most of
them fall and the needle is in the

4710
01:14:28,390 --> 01:14:28,400
them fall and the needle is in the
 

4711
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:29,910
them fall and the needle is in the
haystack end up rising up right

4712
01:14:29,910 --> 01:14:29,920
haystack end up rising up right
 

4713
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:31,189
haystack end up rising up right
incredible mechanism so what that's

4714
01:14:31,189 --> 01:14:31,199
incredible mechanism so what that's
 

4715
01:14:31,199 --> 01:14:32,550
incredible mechanism so what that's
happening is a bunch of people a bunch

4716
01:14:32,550 --> 01:14:32,560
happening is a bunch of people a bunch
 

4717
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:35,189
happening is a bunch of people a bunch
of flawed medium scientists are creating

4718
01:14:35,189 --> 01:14:35,199
of flawed medium scientists are creating
 

4719
01:14:35,199 --> 01:14:38,709
of flawed medium scientists are creating
super intelligence

4720
01:14:38,709 --> 01:14:38,719

 

4721
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:40,790

then there's the primitive mind which

4722
01:14:40,790 --> 01:14:40,800
then there's the primitive mind which
 

4723
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:42,790
then there's the primitive mind which
you know is the the the more limbic

4724
01:14:42,790 --> 01:14:42,800
you know is the the the more limbic
 

4725
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:45,110
you know is the the the more limbic
systemy part of our brain it's the

4726
01:14:45,110 --> 01:14:45,120
systemy part of our brain it's the
 

4727
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:47,270
systemy part of our brain it's the
it's a part of us that is very much not

4728
01:14:47,270 --> 01:14:47,280
it's a part of us that is very much not
 

4729
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:50,229
it's a part of us that is very much not
living in 2021 it's living many tens of

4730
01:14:50,229 --> 01:14:50,239
living in 2021 it's living many tens of
 

4731
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:52,630
living in 2021 it's living many tens of
thousands of years ago and it does not

4732
01:14:52,630 --> 01:14:52,640
thousands of years ago and it does not
 

4733
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:54,310
thousands of years ago and it does not
treat ideas like this separate thing it

4734
01:14:54,310 --> 01:14:54,320
treat ideas like this separate thing it
 

4735
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:57,189
treat ideas like this separate thing it
identifies with its ideas it only gets

4736
01:14:57,189 --> 01:14:57,199
identifies with its ideas it only gets
 

4737
01:14:57,199 --> 01:14:59,830
identifies with its ideas it only gets
involved when it finds an idea sacred it

4738
01:14:59,830 --> 01:14:59,840
involved when it finds an idea sacred it
 

4739
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:01,350
involved when it finds an idea sacred it
starts holding an idea sacred and starts

4740
01:15:01,350 --> 01:15:01,360
starts holding an idea sacred and starts
 

4741
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:03,590
starts holding an idea sacred and starts
identifying so what happens is they team

4742
01:15:03,590 --> 01:15:03,600
identifying so what happens is they team
 

4743
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:06,709
identifying so what happens is they team
up too and so when you have a topic uh

4744
01:15:06,709 --> 01:15:06,719
up too and so when you have a topic uh
 

4745
01:15:06,719 --> 01:15:08,630
up too and so when you have a topic uh
that a bunch of primitive that really

4746
01:15:08,630 --> 01:15:08,640
that a bunch of primitive that really
 

4747
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:12,229
that a bunch of primitive that really
rouses a bunch of primitive minds um it

4748
01:15:12,229 --> 01:15:12,239
rouses a bunch of primitive minds um it
 

4749
01:15:12,239 --> 01:15:14,550
rouses a bunch of primitive minds um it
uh it quickly the primitive minds team

4750
01:15:14,550 --> 01:15:14,560
uh it quickly the primitive minds team
 

4751
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:16,709
uh it quickly the primitive minds team
up and they create an echo chamber where

4752
01:15:16,709 --> 01:15:16,719
up and they create an echo chamber where
 

4753
01:15:16,719 --> 01:15:18,390
up and they create an echo chamber where
suddenly no one can criticize this and

4754
01:15:18,390 --> 01:15:18,400
suddenly no one can criticize this and
 

4755
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:20,550
suddenly no one can criticize this and
in fact if the idea is powerful enough

4756
01:15:20,550 --> 01:15:20,560
in fact if the idea is powerful enough
 

4757
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:21,990
in fact if the idea is powerful enough
people outside the community you can no

4758
01:15:21,990 --> 01:15:22,000
people outside the community you can no
 

4759
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,110
people outside the community you can no
one can criticize it we will get your

4760
01:15:23,110 --> 01:15:23,120
one can criticize it we will get your
 

4761
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:25,350
one can criticize it we will get your
paper attracted we will get you fired

4762
01:15:25,350 --> 01:15:25,360
paper attracted we will get you fired
 

4763
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:26,950
paper attracted we will get you fired
right that's not higher mind behavior

4764
01:15:26,950 --> 01:15:26,960
right that's not higher mind behavior
 

4765
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:28,950
right that's not higher mind behavior
that is crazy primitive mind and so now

4766
01:15:28,950 --> 01:15:28,960
that is crazy primitive mind and so now
 

4767
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:30,790
that is crazy primitive mind and so now
what happens is the collective becomes

4768
01:15:30,790 --> 01:15:30,800
what happens is the collective becomes
 

4769
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:33,030
what happens is the collective becomes
dumber than an individual a dumber than

4770
01:15:33,030 --> 01:15:33,040
dumber than an individual a dumber than
 

4771
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:34,790
dumber than an individual a dumber than
a reason a single reasoning individual

4772
01:15:34,790 --> 01:15:34,800
a reason a single reasoning individual
 

4773
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:36,550
a reason a single reasoning individual
you have this collective is suddenly

4774
01:15:36,550 --> 01:15:36,560
you have this collective is suddenly
 

4775
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:39,430
you have this collective is suddenly
attached to this sacred scripture

4776
01:15:39,430 --> 01:15:39,440
attached to this sacred scripture
 

4777
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:40,630
attached to this sacred scripture
with the idea

4778
01:15:40,630 --> 01:15:40,640
with the idea
 

4779
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:42,709
with the idea
and they and they will not change their

4780
01:15:42,709 --> 01:15:42,719
and they and they will not change their
 

4781
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:44,229
and they and they will not change their
mind and they get dumber and dumber and

4782
01:15:44,229 --> 01:15:44,239
mind and they get dumber and dumber and
 

4783
01:15:44,239 --> 01:15:47,110
mind and they get dumber and dumber and
so climate change which what's worrisome

4784
01:15:47,110 --> 01:15:47,120
so climate change which what's worrisome
 

4785
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:49,350
so climate change which what's worrisome
is that climate change has in many ways

4786
01:15:49,350 --> 01:15:49,360
is that climate change has in many ways
 

4787
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:51,669
is that climate change has in many ways
become a sacred topic where if you come

4788
01:15:51,669 --> 01:15:51,679
become a sacred topic where if you come
 

4789
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:52,790
become a sacred topic where if you come
up with a nuanced thing you might get

4790
01:15:52,790 --> 01:15:52,800
up with a nuanced thing you might get
 

4791
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:55,030
up with a nuanced thing you might get
called branded a denier yes so there

4792
01:15:55,030 --> 01:15:55,040
called branded a denier yes so there
 

4793
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:56,550
called branded a denier yes so there
goes this there goes the super

4794
01:15:56,550 --> 01:15:56,560
goes this there goes the super
 

4795
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:58,709
goes this there goes the super
intelligence all the arrows no arrows

4796
01:15:58,709 --> 01:15:58,719
intelligence all the arrows no arrows
 

4797
01:15:58,719 --> 01:16:00,550
intelligence all the arrows no arrows
can be fired but if you get called a

4798
01:16:00,550 --> 01:16:00,560
can be fired but if you get called a
 

4799
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:01,990
can be fired but if you get called a
denier that's a social penalty for

4800
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:02,000
denier that's a social penalty for
 

4801
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,709
denier that's a social penalty for
firing an arrow at a certain orthodoxy

4802
01:16:04,709 --> 01:16:04,719
firing an arrow at a certain orthodoxy
 

4803
01:16:04,719 --> 01:16:06,470
firing an arrow at a certain orthodoxy
right and so what's happening is the big

4804
01:16:06,470 --> 01:16:06,480
right and so what's happening is the big
 

4805
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:07,990
right and so what's happening is the big
brain gets like frozen right and it

4806
01:16:07,990 --> 01:16:08,000
brain gets like frozen right and it
 

4807
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,149
brain gets like frozen right and it
becomes very stupid now you can also say

4808
01:16:10,149 --> 01:16:10,159
becomes very stupid now you can also say
 

4809
01:16:10,159 --> 01:16:11,990
becomes very stupid now you can also say
that about a lot of other topics right

4810
01:16:11,990 --> 01:16:12,000
that about a lot of other topics right
 

4811
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,870
that about a lot of other topics right
now uh you know you you know um uh you

4812
01:16:14,870 --> 01:16:14,880
now uh you know you you know um uh you
 

4813
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:16,149
now uh you know you you know um uh you
just mentioned another one i forget what

4814
01:16:16,149 --> 01:16:16,159
just mentioned another one i forget what
 

4815
01:16:16,159 --> 01:16:18,870
just mentioned another one i forget what
it was but that's also kind of like

4816
01:16:18,870 --> 01:16:18,880
it was but that's also kind of like
 

4817
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:21,030
it was but that's also kind of like
the world of vaccines yeah yeah covet

4818
01:16:21,030 --> 01:16:21,040
the world of vaccines yeah yeah covet
 

4819
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:22,870
the world of vaccines yeah yeah covet
okay and here's my point earlier is that

4820
01:16:22,870 --> 01:16:22,880
okay and here's my point earlier is that
 

4821
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:24,550
okay and here's my point earlier is that
we what i see is that the political

4822
01:16:24,550 --> 01:16:24,560
we what i see is that the political
 

4823
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:25,590
we what i see is that the political
divide

4824
01:16:25,590 --> 01:16:25,600
divide
 

4825
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:27,430
divide
has is like a whirlpool that's pulling

4826
01:16:27,430 --> 01:16:27,440
has is like a whirlpool that's pulling
 

4827
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:30,790
has is like a whirlpool that's pulling
everything into it and in that whirlpool

4828
01:16:30,790 --> 01:16:30,800
everything into it and in that whirlpool
 

4829
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:32,470
everything into it and in that whirlpool
uh thinking is done with the primitive

4830
01:16:32,470 --> 01:16:32,480
uh thinking is done with the primitive
 

4831
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:33,430
uh thinking is done with the primitive
mind

4832
01:16:33,430 --> 01:16:33,440
mind
 

4833
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:34,709
mind
tribes

4834
01:16:34,709 --> 01:16:34,719
tribes
 

4835
01:16:34,719 --> 01:16:36,229
tribes
and so

4836
01:16:36,229 --> 01:16:36,239
and so
 

4837
01:16:36,239 --> 01:16:37,510
and so
i get you know okay obviously something

4838
01:16:37,510 --> 01:16:37,520
i get you know okay obviously something
 

4839
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:39,270
i get you know okay obviously something
like race right that makes sense that

4840
01:16:39,270 --> 01:16:39,280
like race right that makes sense that
 

4841
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:40,950
like race right that makes sense that
that also right now the topic of race

4842
01:16:40,950 --> 01:16:40,960
that also right now the topic of race
 

4843
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:42,630
that also right now the topic of race
for example or gender these things are

4844
01:16:42,630 --> 01:16:42,640
for example or gender these things are
 

4845
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:44,709
for example or gender these things are
in the whirlpool but that at least is

4846
01:16:44,709 --> 01:16:44,719
in the whirlpool but that at least is
 

4847
01:16:44,719 --> 01:16:46,229
in the whirlpool but that at least is
like okay that's something that the

4848
01:16:46,229 --> 01:16:46,239
like okay that's something that the
 

4849
01:16:46,239 --> 01:16:47,990
like okay that's something that the
primitive mind would always get really

4850
01:16:47,990 --> 01:16:48,000
primitive mind would always get really
 

4851
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,830
primitive mind would always get really
worked up about you know it taps into

4852
01:16:49,830 --> 01:16:49,840
worked up about you know it taps into
 

4853
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:51,750
worked up about you know it taps into
like our deepest kind of like primal

4854
01:16:51,750 --> 01:16:51,760
like our deepest kind of like primal
 

4855
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:52,550
like our deepest kind of like primal
selves

4856
01:16:52,550 --> 01:16:52,560
selves
 

4857
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:53,910
selves
um

4858
01:16:53,910 --> 01:16:53,920
um
 

4859
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:55,830
um
covet you know make this cove in a way

4860
01:16:55,830 --> 01:16:55,840
covet you know make this cove in a way
 

4861
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:57,189
covet you know make this cove in a way
too you know climate change like that

4862
01:16:57,189 --> 01:16:57,199
too you know climate change like that
 

4863
01:16:57,199 --> 01:16:57,990
too you know climate change like that
should just be something that our

4864
01:16:57,990 --> 01:16:58,000
should just be something that our
 

4865
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,189
should just be something that our
rational brains are like let's solve

4866
01:16:59,189 --> 01:16:59,199
rational brains are like let's solve
 

4867
01:16:59,199 --> 01:17:00,950
rational brains are like let's solve
this complex problem but the problem is

4868
01:17:00,950 --> 01:17:00,960
this complex problem but the problem is
 

4869
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:02,950
this complex problem but the problem is
that it's all gotten sucked into the red

4870
01:17:02,950 --> 01:17:02,960
that it's all gotten sucked into the red
 

4871
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:04,630
that it's all gotten sucked into the red
versus blue whirlpool and once that

4872
01:17:04,630 --> 01:17:04,640
versus blue whirlpool and once that
 

4873
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:05,669
versus blue whirlpool and once that
happens it's in the hands of the

4874
01:17:05,669 --> 01:17:05,679

4875
01:17:05,679 --> 01:17:07,189
happens it's in the hands of the
primitive minds and we we're losing our

primitive minds and we we're losing our
 

4877
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:09,430

decisions uh where it's like it's like
 

4881
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:13,189
decisions uh where it's like it's like
it's like the big species brain is like

4882
01:17:13,189 --> 01:17:13,199
it's like the big species brain is like
 

4883
01:17:13,199 --> 01:17:15,350
it's like the big species brain is like
or the big american brain is like drunk

or the big american brain is like drunk
 

4885
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:17,110
or the big american brain is like drunk
at the wheel right now and we're about

4886
01:17:17,110 --> 01:17:17,120
at the wheel right now and we're about
 

4887
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:18,950
at the wheel right now and we're about
to go into her future with more and more

4888
01:17:18,950 --> 01:17:18,960
to go into her future with more and more
 

4889
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:21,910
to go into her future with more and more
big technologies uh scary things but to

4890
01:17:21,910 --> 01:17:21,920
big technologies uh scary things but to
 

4891
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:23,430
big technologies uh scary things but to
make big right decisions and not you

4892
01:17:23,430 --> 01:17:23,440
make big right decisions and not you
 

4893
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:25,430
make big right decisions and not you
know we're getting dumber as a

4894
01:17:25,430 --> 01:17:25,440
know we're getting dumber as a
 

4895
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:27,110
know we're getting dumber as a
collective and that that's part of this

4896
01:17:27,110 --> 01:17:27,120
collective and that that's part of this
 

4897
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:28,870
collective and that that's part of this
environmental problem so within the

4898
01:17:28,870 --> 01:17:28,880
environmental problem so within the
 

4899
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:30,790
environmental problem so within the
space of technologists and the space of

4900
01:17:30,790 --> 01:17:30,800
space of technologists and the space of
 

4901
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:33,110
space of technologists and the space of
scientists we should allow the arrows

4902
01:17:33,110 --> 01:17:33,120
scientists we should allow the arrows
 

4903
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:34,550
scientists we should allow the arrows
that's one of the saddest things to me

4904
01:17:34,550 --> 01:17:34,560
that's one of the saddest things to me
 

4905
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:35,990
that's one of the saddest things to me
about is like

4906
01:17:35,990 --> 01:17:36,000
about is like
 

4907
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,709
about is like
the scientists like i

4908
01:17:38,709 --> 01:17:38,719
the scientists like i
 

4909
01:17:38,719 --> 01:17:40,390
the scientists like i
i've seen arrogance there's a lot of

4910
01:17:40,390 --> 01:17:40,400
i've seen arrogance there's a lot of
 

4911
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:42,470
i've seen arrogance there's a lot of
mechanisms that maintain the tribe it's

mechanisms that maintain the tribe it's
 

4913
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:44,709
mechanisms that maintain the tribe it's
the arrogance it's it's a it's how you

the arrogance it's it's a it's how you
 

4915
01:17:44,719 --> 01:17:47,750
the arrogance it's it's a it's how you
build up the this mechanism that defends

4916
01:17:47,750 --> 01:17:47,760
build up the this mechanism that defends
 

4917
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:49,270
build up the this mechanism that defends
this wall that defends against the

this wall that defends against the
 

4919
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:51,510
this wall that defends against the
arrows it's uh

4920
01:17:51,510 --> 01:17:51,520
arrows it's uh
 

4921
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:54,229

your own ideas this ideal of science
 

4933
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:05,590
your own ideas this ideal of science
that makes science beautiful

4934
01:18:05,590 --> 01:18:05,600
that makes science beautiful
 

4935
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:08,070
that makes science beautiful
in in a time of fear

4936
01:18:08,070 --> 01:18:08,080
in in a time of fear
 

4937
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:09,990
in in a time of fear
and in a time of division created by

and in a time of division created by
 

4939

system dumber
 

4945
01:18:16,159 --> 01:18:18,550
system dumber
the science system dumber

the science system dumber
 

4947
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:21,910
the science system dumber
uh the the the tech developer system

4948
01:18:21,910 --> 01:18:21,920
uh the the the tech developer system
 

4949
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:23,510
uh the the the tech developer system
dumber if they don't allow the

4950

dumber if they don't allow the
 

4951
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:25,669
dumber if they don't allow the
challenging of ideas what's really bad

4952
01:18:25,669 --> 01:18:25,679
challenging of ideas what's really bad
 

4953
01:18:25,679 --> 01:18:27,189
challenging of ideas what's really bad
is that like

4954
01:18:27,189 --> 01:18:27,199
is that like
 

4955
01:18:27,199 --> 01:18:28,870
is that like
in a normal environment you're always

4956
01:18:28,870 --> 01:18:28,880
in a normal environment you're always
 

4957
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:30,630
in a normal environment you're always
going to have echo chambers and so

4958
01:18:30,630 --> 01:18:30,640
going to have echo chambers and so
 

4959
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:32,390
going to have echo chambers and so
what's the opposite of an echo chamber i

4960
01:18:32,390 --> 01:18:32,400
what's the opposite of an echo chamber i
 

4961
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:33,750
what's the opposite of an echo chamber i
i created a term for because i think we

4962
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:33,760
i created a term for because i think we
 

4963
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:35,669
i created a term for because i think we
need it which is called an ideal lab an

4964
01:18:35,669 --> 01:18:35,679
need it which is called an ideal lab an
 

4965
01:18:35,679 --> 01:18:37,510
need it which is called an ideal lab an
idea lab right it's like people treat

4966
01:18:37,510 --> 01:18:37,520
idea lab right it's like people treat
 

4967
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:38,870
idea lab right it's like people treat
it's like people act like scientists

4968
01:18:38,870 --> 01:18:38,880
it's like people act like scientists
 

4969
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:40,470
it's like people act like scientists
even if they're not doing science they

4970
01:18:40,470 --> 01:18:40,480
even if they're not doing science they
 

4971
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:42,870
even if they're not doing science they
just treat their ideas like science

4972
01:18:42,870 --> 01:18:42,880
just treat their ideas like science
 

4973
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:44,149
just treat their ideas like science
experiments and they toss them out there

4974
01:18:44,149 --> 01:18:44,159
experiments and they toss them out there
 

4975
01:18:44,159 --> 01:18:45,830
experiments and they toss them out there
and everyone disagrees and disagreement

4976
01:18:45,830 --> 01:18:45,840
and everyone disagrees and disagreement
 

4977
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:47,350
and everyone disagrees and disagreement
is like the game everyone likes to

becomes smarter you're always going to
 

5009
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:12,709
becomes smarter you're always going to
have idea labs and echo chambers right

5010
01:19:12,709 --> 01:19:12,719
have idea labs and echo chambers right
 

5011
01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:14,070
have idea labs and echo chambers right
in different communities and most of us

5012
01:19:14,070 --> 01:19:14,080
in different communities and most of us
 

5013
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:15,910
in different communities and most of us
participate in both of them you know and

5031
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:31,510
happens her bullying is forcing the
whole room to be an echo chamber

5032
01:19:31,510 --> 01:19:31,520
whole room to be an echo chamber
 

5033
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:33,830

an
 

5045
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:43,830
an
echo chamber person stays in their echo

5046
01:19:43,830 --> 01:19:43,840
echo chamber person stays in their echo
 

5047
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:45,030
echo chamber person stays in their echo
chamber they don't like they they will

5048
01:19:45,030 --> 01:19:45,040
chamber they don't like they they will
 

5049
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:46,310
chamber they don't like they they will
cut you out they don't they don't like

5050

5053
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:48,550
to be friends with people who disagree
with them you notice that they will cut

5054
01:19:48,550 --> 01:19:48,560
with them you notice that they will cut
 

5055
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:50,149
with them you notice that they will cut
you out they'll cut out their parents if

that's how they do it they will say i'm
 

5065
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:56,630
that's how they do it they will say i'm
gonna stay inside of an echo chamber

5066
01:19:56,630 --> 01:19:56,640
gonna stay inside of an echo chamber
 

5067
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:59,669
gonna stay inside of an echo chamber
safely so my ideas which i identify with

5068
01:19:59,669 --> 01:19:59,679
safely so my ideas which i identify with
 

5069
01:19:59,679 --> 01:20:00,470
safely so my ideas which i identify with
um

5070

um
 

5071
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:01,830
um
because my primitive mind is doing the

[\h__\h] right so the echo chamber uh
 

5099
01:20:20,719 --> 01:20:23,110
[\h__\h] right so the echo chamber uh
person uh it doesn't have much power

person uh it doesn't have much power
 

5101
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:24,470
person uh it doesn't have much power
once they leave the echo chamber

5102
01:20:24,470 --> 01:20:24,480
once they leave the echo chamber
 

5103
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:26,390
once they leave the echo chamber
likewise the idea lab person they have

01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:27,510
likewise the idea lab person they have
this great environment but if they go

5106

this great environment but if they go
 

5107
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:29,030
this great environment but if they go
into an echo chamber where everyone else

that the echo chambers have
 

5125
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:46,870

found ways to forcefully expand

5126

against echo chambers like universities
 

5135
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:55,510

01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:45,430
the question goes why do we prefer to
watch a film we haven't watched before

5188
01:21:45,430 --> 01:21:45,440
watch a film we haven't watched before
 

5189
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:47,669
watch a film we haven't watched before
but we want to listen to songs that we

5190
01:21:47,669 --> 01:21:47,679
but we want to listen to songs that we
 

5191
01:21:47,679 --> 01:21:49,910
but we want to listen to songs that we
have heard hundreds of times

5192
01:21:49,910 --> 01:21:49,920
have heard hundreds of times
 

5193
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:51,910
have heard hundreds of times
this question and your answer really

5194
01:21:51,910 --> 01:21:51,920
this question and your answer really
 

5195
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:53,430
this question and your answer really
started to make me think like yeah

5196
01:21:53,430 --> 01:21:53,440
started to make me think like yeah
 

5197
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:55,510
started to make me think like yeah
that's true that's really interesting

5198
01:21:55,510 --> 01:21:55,520
that's true that's really interesting
 

5199
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:57,910
that's true that's really interesting
like we draw that line

5200
01:21:57,910 --> 01:21:57,920
like we draw that line
 

5201
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:00,790
like we draw that line
somehow so what's the answer so i think

5202
01:22:00,790 --> 01:22:00,800
somehow so what's the answer so i think
 

5203
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:02,950
somehow so what's the answer so i think
let's use these two minds again i think

5204
01:22:02,950 --> 01:22:02,960
let's use these two minds again i think
 

5205
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:04,790
let's use these two minds again i think
that when your higher mind is the one

5206
01:22:04,790 --> 01:22:04,800
that when your higher mind is the one
 

5207
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:06,229
that when your higher mind is the one
who's taking something in and they're

5208
01:22:06,229 --> 01:22:06,239
who's taking something in and they're
 

5209
01:22:06,239 --> 01:22:07,430
who's taking something in and they're
really interested in you know what are

5210
01:22:07,430 --> 01:22:07,440
really interested in you know what are
 

5211
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:08,390
really interested in you know what are
the lyrics or i'm going to learn

5212
01:22:08,390 --> 01:22:08,400
the lyrics or i'm going to learn
 

5213
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:09,669
the lyrics or i'm going to learn
something or what

5214
01:22:09,669 --> 01:22:09,679
something or what
 

5215
01:22:09,679 --> 01:22:10,470
something or what
you know

5216
01:22:10,470 --> 01:22:10,480
you know
 

5217
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:11,510
you know
reading a book or whatever and the

5218
01:22:11,510 --> 01:22:11,520
reading a book or whatever and the
 

5219
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:13,189
reading a book or whatever and the
higher mind is um

5220
01:22:13,189 --> 01:22:13,199
higher mind is um
 

5221
01:22:13,199 --> 01:22:14,629
higher mind is um
is

5222
01:22:14,629 --> 01:22:14,639
is
 

5223
01:22:14,639 --> 01:22:15,990
is
trying to get information and once it

5224
01:22:15,990 --> 01:22:16,000
trying to get information and once it
 

5225
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,350
trying to get information and once it
has it there's no point in listening to

5226
01:22:17,350 --> 01:22:17,360
has it there's no point in listening to
 

5227
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:19,669
has it there's no point in listening to
it again it has the information um you

5228
01:22:19,669 --> 01:22:19,679
it again it has the information um you
 

5229
01:22:19,679 --> 01:22:21,270
it again it has the information um you
know your rational brain is like i got

5230
01:22:21,270 --> 01:22:21,280
know your rational brain is like i got
 

5231
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:23,430
know your rational brain is like i got
it

5232
01:22:23,430 --> 01:22:23,440
it
 

5233
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:26,310
it
but when you eat a good meal or have sex

5234
01:22:26,310 --> 01:22:26,320
but when you eat a good meal or have sex
 

5235
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:27,750
but when you eat a good meal or have sex
or whatever you're that's something you

5236
01:22:27,750 --> 01:22:27,760
or whatever you're that's something you
 

5237
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:29,189
or whatever you're that's something you
can do again and again because it

5238
01:22:29,189 --> 01:22:29,199
can do again and again because it
 

5239
01:22:29,199 --> 01:22:32,229
can do again and again because it
actually your primitive brain loves it

5240
01:22:32,229 --> 01:22:32,239
actually your primitive brain loves it
 

5241
01:22:32,239 --> 01:22:34,229
actually your primitive brain loves it
right and it never gets sport of things

5242
01:22:34,229 --> 01:22:34,239
right and it never gets sport of things
 

5243
01:22:34,239 --> 01:22:36,870
right and it never gets sport of things
that it loves so i think music is a very

5244
01:22:36,870 --> 01:22:36,880
that it loves so i think music is a very
 

5245
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:39,030
that it loves so i think music is a very
primal thing i think music goes right

5246
01:22:39,030 --> 01:22:39,040
primal thing i think music goes right
 

5247
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:41,189
primal thing i think music goes right
into our primitive brain a lot you know

5248
01:22:41,189 --> 01:22:41,199
into our primitive brain a lot you know
 

5249
01:22:41,199 --> 01:22:42,790
into our primitive brain a lot you know
um you know i think it's of course it's

5250
01:22:42,790 --> 01:22:42,800
um you know i think it's of course it's
 

5251
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:44,310
um you know i think it's of course it's
a collaboration you're you know your

5252
01:22:44,310 --> 01:22:44,320
a collaboration you're you know your
 

5253
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:45,910
a collaboration you're you know your
your rational brain is absorbing the

5254
01:22:45,910 --> 01:22:45,920
your rational brain is absorbing the
 

5255
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:48,070
your rational brain is absorbing the
actual message and but i think it's all

5256
01:22:48,070 --> 01:22:48,080
actual message and but i think it's all
 

5257
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:49,510
actual message and but i think it's all
about emotions and and even more than

5258
01:22:49,510 --> 01:22:49,520
about emotions and and even more than
 

5259
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:51,350
about emotions and and even more than
emotions it literally like the you know

5260
01:22:51,350 --> 01:22:51,360
emotions it literally like the you know
 

5261
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:54,550
emotions it literally like the you know
music taps into like some very very

5262
01:22:54,550 --> 01:22:54,560
music taps into like some very very
 

5263
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:55,350
music taps into like some very very
deep

5264
01:22:55,350 --> 01:22:55,360
deep
 

5265
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:56,390
deep
um

5266
01:22:56,390 --> 01:22:56,400
um
 

5267
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:57,750
um
you know

5268
01:22:57,750 --> 01:22:57,760
you know
 

5269
01:22:57,760 --> 01:23:00,390
you know
primal part of us and so when you hear a

5270
01:23:00,390 --> 01:23:00,400
primal part of us and so when you hear a
 

5271
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:01,830
primal part of us and so when you hear a
song once

5272
01:23:01,830 --> 01:23:01,840
song once
 

5273
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:03,110
song once
even you're some of your favorite songs

5274
01:23:03,110 --> 01:23:03,120
even you're some of your favorite songs
 

5275
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:04,070
even you're some of your favorite songs
the first time you heard it you were

5276
01:23:04,070 --> 01:23:04,080
the first time you heard it you were
 

5277
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:07,189
the first time you heard it you were
like i guess that's kind of catchy yeah

5278
01:23:07,189 --> 01:23:07,199
like i guess that's kind of catchy yeah
 

5279
01:23:07,199 --> 01:23:08,870
like i guess that's kind of catchy yeah
and then some and and then you end up

5280
01:23:08,870 --> 01:23:08,880
and then some and and then you end up
 

5281
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:10,149
and then some and and then you end up
loving it on the 10th listen but

5282
01:23:10,149 --> 01:23:10,159
loving it on the 10th listen but
 

5283
01:23:10,159 --> 01:23:11,430
loving it on the 10th listen but
sometimes you even don't eat like a song

5284
01:23:11,430 --> 01:23:11,440
sometimes you even don't eat like a song
 

5285
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:12,709
sometimes you even don't eat like a song
you're like oh this song sucks but you

5286
01:23:12,709 --> 01:23:12,719
you're like oh this song sucks but you
 

5287
01:23:12,719 --> 01:23:14,790
you're like oh this song sucks but you
suddenly you find yourself on the 40th

5288
01:23:14,790 --> 01:23:14,800
suddenly you find yourself on the 40th
 

5289
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:15,910
suddenly you find yourself on the 40th
time because it's on the radio all the

5290
01:23:15,910 --> 01:23:15,920
time because it's on the radio all the
 

5291
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:16,870
time because it's on the radio all the
time just kind of being like oh i love

5292
01:23:16,870 --> 01:23:16,880
time just kind of being like oh i love
 

5293
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:18,470
time just kind of being like oh i love
this song and you're like wait i i don't

5297
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:21,110
i hated this song and what's happening
is that

5298
01:23:21,110 --> 01:23:21,120
is that
 

5299
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:23,270
is that
the sound is actually the music's

5300
01:23:23,270 --> 01:23:23,280
the sound is actually the music's
 

5301
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:25,350
the sound is actually the music's
actually carving a

5302
01:23:25,350 --> 01:23:25,360
actually carving a
 

5303
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:27,110
actually carving a
pathway in your brain

5304
01:23:27,110 --> 01:23:27,120
pathway in your brain
 

5305
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:29,910
pathway in your brain
and it's a dance and when your brain

5306
01:23:29,910 --> 01:23:29,920
and it's a dance and when your brain
 

5307
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:31,830
and it's a dance and when your brain
knows what's coming it can dance it

5308
01:23:31,830 --> 01:23:31,840
knows what's coming it can dance it
 

5309
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:33,910
knows what's coming it can dance it
knows the steps so your brain is your

5310
01:23:33,910 --> 01:23:33,920
knows the steps so your brain is your
 

5311
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:35,510
knows the steps so your brain is your
internal kind of

5312
01:23:35,510 --> 01:23:35,520
internal kind of
 

5313
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:37,030
internal kind of
your brain is actually dancing with the

5314
01:23:37,030 --> 01:23:37,040
your brain is actually dancing with the
 

5315
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:38,790
your brain is actually dancing with the
music and it knows the steps and it can

5316
01:23:38,790 --> 01:23:38,800
music and it knows the steps and it can
 

5317
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:41,750
music and it knows the steps and it can
anticipate um and it and it

5318
01:23:41,750 --> 01:23:41,760
anticipate um and it and it
 

5319
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:44,070
anticipate um and it and it
and so there's something about

5320
01:23:44,070 --> 01:23:44,080
and so there's something about
 

5321
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:46,070
and so there's something about
knowing having memorized the song that

5322
01:23:46,070 --> 01:23:46,080
knowing having memorized the song that
 

5323
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:48,709
knowing having memorized the song that
makes it incredibly enjoyable to us um

5324
01:23:48,709 --> 01:23:48,719
makes it incredibly enjoyable to us um
 

5325
01:23:48,719 --> 01:23:49,830
makes it incredibly enjoyable to us um
but when we hear it for the first time

5326
01:23:49,830 --> 01:23:49,840
but when we hear it for the first time
 

5327
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:50,550
but when we hear it for the first time
we don't know where it's going to go

5328
01:23:50,550 --> 01:23:50,560
we don't know where it's going to go
 

5329
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:51,750
we don't know where it's going to go
we're like an awkward dancer we don't

5330
01:23:51,750 --> 01:23:51,760
we're like an awkward dancer we don't
 

5331
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:53,270
we're like an awkward dancer we don't
know the steps and your primitive brain

5332
01:23:53,270 --> 01:23:53,280
know the steps and your primitive brain
 

5333
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:55,030
know the steps and your primitive brain
can't really have that much fun yet

5334
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:55,040
can't really have that much fun yet
 

5335
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:57,270
can't really have that much fun yet
that's how i feel and then in the movies

5336
01:23:57,270 --> 01:23:57,280
that's how i feel and then in the movies
 

5337
01:23:57,280 --> 01:24:00,070
that's how i feel and then in the movies
that's more that's less primitive that's

5338
01:24:00,070 --> 01:24:00,080
that's more that's less primitive that's
 

5339
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:01,350
that's more that's less primitive that's
the story

5340
01:24:01,350 --> 01:24:01,360
the story
 

5341
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:03,510
the story
you're you're you're taking in

5342
01:24:03,510 --> 01:24:03,520

that many but versus if you're watching
 

5351
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:12,550
that many but versus if you're watching
a talk show right listening to if you're

5361
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:20,629
podcasts no matter how good it is 12
times because it's you once you've got

5362
01:24:20,629 --> 01:24:20,639
times because it's you once you've got
 

5363
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:23,510
times because it's you once you've got
it you got it it's a form of

5364
01:24:23,510 --> 01:24:23,520
it you got it it's a form of
 

5365
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:24,790
it you got it it's a form of
information that's very higher mind

5366
01:24:24,790 --> 01:24:24,800
information that's very higher mind
 

5367
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:26,790
information that's very higher mind
focused that's that's how it is well you

5368
01:24:26,790 --> 01:24:26,800
focused that's that's how it is well you
 

5369
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:28,629
focused that's that's how it is well you
know the funny thing is there's people

5370
01:24:28,629 --> 01:24:28,639
know the funny thing is there's people
 

5371
01:24:28,639 --> 01:24:31,270
know the funny thing is there's people
that listen to a podcast episode many

5372
01:24:31,270 --> 01:24:31,280
that listen to a podcast episode many
 

5373
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:33,430
that listen to a podcast episode many
many times and often i think the reason

5374
01:24:33,430 --> 01:24:33,440
many times and often i think the reason
 

5375
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:35,189
many times and often i think the reason
for that is not because the information

5376
01:24:35,189 --> 01:24:35,199
for that is not because the information
 

5377
01:24:35,199 --> 01:24:36,950
for that is not because the information
is the chemistry is the music of the

5378
01:24:36,950 --> 01:24:36,960
is the chemistry is the music of the
 

5379
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:38,790
is the chemistry is the music of the
conversation yeah so it's not the action

writing you did that like
 

5413
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:10,390

the new link is um
 

5435
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:34,070
the new link is um
somehow it was a really powerful way to

5436
01:25:34,070 --> 01:25:34,080
somehow it was a really powerful way to
 

5437
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:36,070
somehow it was a really powerful way to
to explain that you actually propose

5438
01:25:36,070 --> 01:25:36,080
to explain that you actually propose
 

5439

that the the man of the year cover of

5440
01:25:38,229 --> 01:25:38,239
that the the man of the year cover of
 

5441
01:25:38,239 --> 01:25:40,550
that the the man of the year cover of
time should be um one of my drawings why

5442
01:25:40,550 --> 01:25:40,560
time should be um one of my drawings why
 

5443
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:42,149
time should be um one of my drawings why
are your drawings yes yes there's an

5444

uh what are your thoughts about like all
 

5453
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:50,629
uh what are your thoughts about like all
those years later about your link

5454
01:25:50,629 --> 01:25:50,639
those years later about your link
 

5455
01:25:50,639 --> 01:25:53,669
those years later about your link
do you find this idea like what excites

5456
01:25:53,669 --> 01:25:53,679
do you find this idea like what excites
 

5457
01:25:53,679 --> 01:25:55,270
do you find this idea like what excites
you about is the big long term

5458
01:25:55,270 --> 01:25:55,280
you about is the big long term
 

5459
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:57,430
you about is the big long term
philosophical things is it the the

5460
01:25:57,430 --> 01:25:57,440
philosophical things is it the the
 

5461
01:25:57,440 --> 01:25:59,110
philosophical things is it the the
practical things do you think is super

5462
01:25:59,110 --> 01:25:59,120
practical things do you think is super
 

5463
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:01,990
practical things do you think is super
difficult to do on the neurosurgery side

5464
01:26:01,990 --> 01:26:02,000
difficult to do on the neurosurgery side
 

5465
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,590
difficult to do on the neurosurgery side
and the material engineering the

5466
01:26:03,590 --> 01:26:03,600
and the material engineering the
 

5467
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:04,950
and the material engineering the
robotics side

5468
01:26:04,950 --> 01:26:04,960
robotics side
 

5469
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:07,669
robotics side
or do you think um the machine learning

5470
01:26:07,669 --> 01:26:07,679
or do you think um the machine learning
 

5471
01:26:07,679 --> 01:26:09,350
or do you think um the machine learning
side for the brain computer interfaces

5472
01:26:09,350 --> 01:26:09,360
side for the brain computer interfaces
 

5473
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:11,030
side for the brain computer interfaces
where they get to learn about each other

5474
01:26:11,030 --> 01:26:11,040
where they get to learn about each other
 

5475
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:12,390

studied it okay on computer interfaces i

5484
01:26:19,510 --> 01:26:19,520
studied it okay on computer interfaces i
 

5485
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:21,990
studied it okay on computer interfaces i
mean i'm super excited about it um it's

even though it's somewhere far
neuralink is changing what a person is

5500
01:26:36,310 --> 01:26:36,320
neuralink is changing what a person is
 

5501
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:38,390
neuralink is changing what a person is
um eventually now

5502
01:26:38,390 --> 01:26:38,400
um eventually now
 

5503
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:40,790
um eventually now
i i think that neuralink

5504
01:26:40,790 --> 01:26:40,800
i i think that neuralink
 

5505
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:43,110
i i think that neuralink
engineers and elon himself would all be

5506
01:26:43,110 --> 01:26:43,120
engineers and elon himself would all be
 

5507
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:44,950
engineers and elon himself would all be
the first to admit that it is a maybe

5508
01:26:44,950 --> 01:26:44,960
the first to admit that it is a maybe
 

5509
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:46,310
the first to admit that it is a maybe
that when they whether they can do their

5510
01:26:46,310 --> 01:26:46,320
that when they whether they can do their
 

5511
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:48,709
that when they whether they can do their
goals here i mean it is so crazy

5512
01:26:48,709 --> 01:26:48,719
goals here i mean it is so crazy
 

5513
01:26:48,719 --> 01:26:50,470
goals here i mean it is so crazy
ambitious to try to you know their

5514
01:26:50,470 --> 01:26:50,480
ambitious to try to you know their
 

5515
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:52,550
ambitious to try to you know their
eventual goals are you know of course in

5516
01:26:52,550 --> 01:26:52,560
eventual goals are you know of course in
 

5517
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:54,390
eventual goals are you know of course in
the in the interim they have a higher

5518
01:26:54,390 --> 01:26:54,400
the in the interim they have a higher
 

5519
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:55,830
the in the interim they have a higher
probability of accomplishing smaller

5520
01:26:55,830 --> 01:26:55,840
probability of accomplishing smaller
 

5521
01:26:55,840 --> 01:26:57,590
probability of accomplishing smaller
things which are still huge like

5522
01:26:57,590 --> 01:26:57,600
things which are still huge like
 

5523
01:26:57,600 --> 01:26:59,830
things which are still huge like
basically solving paralysis

5524
01:26:59,830 --> 01:26:59,840
basically solving paralysis
 

5525
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:02,229
basically solving paralysis
uh you know strokes parkinson things

5526
01:27:02,229 --> 01:27:02,239
uh you know strokes parkinson things
 

5527
01:27:02,239 --> 01:27:03,750
uh you know strokes parkinson things
like that i mean it can be unbelievable

5528
01:27:03,750 --> 01:27:03,760
like that i mean it can be unbelievable
 

5529
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:04,790
like that i mean it can be unbelievable
and you know

5530
01:27:04,790 --> 01:27:04,800
and you know
 

5531
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:05,990
and you know
anyone who doesn't have one of these

5532
01:27:05,990 --> 01:27:06,000
anyone who doesn't have one of these
 

5533
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:07,669
anyone who doesn't have one of these
things like we might you know everyone

5534
01:27:07,669 --> 01:27:07,679
things like we might you know everyone
 

5535
01:27:07,679 --> 01:27:10,629
things like we might you know everyone
should be very happy about um

5536
01:27:10,629 --> 01:27:10,639
should be very happy about um
 

5537
01:27:10,639 --> 01:27:12,709
should be very happy about um
this kind of um helping with different

5538
01:27:12,709 --> 01:27:12,719
this kind of um helping with different
 

5539
01:27:12,719 --> 01:27:14,390
this kind of um helping with different
disabilities

5540
01:27:14,390 --> 01:27:14,400
disabilities
 

5541
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:15,270
disabilities
um

5542
01:27:15,270 --> 01:27:15,280
um
 

5543
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:19,430
um
but the thing that is like so the grand

5544
01:27:19,430 --> 01:27:19,440
but the thing that is like so the grand
 

5545
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:22,229
but the thing that is like so the grand
goal is this augmentation where it's you

5546
01:27:22,229 --> 01:27:22,239
goal is this augmentation where it's you
 

5547
01:27:22,239 --> 01:27:23,510
goal is this augmentation where it's you
take someone who's totally healthy and

5548
01:27:23,510 --> 01:27:23,520
take someone who's totally healthy and
 

5549
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:25,510
take someone who's totally healthy and
you put a pre-machine interface in any

5550
01:27:25,510 --> 01:27:25,520
you put a pre-machine interface in any
 

5551
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:27,910
you put a pre-machine interface in any
way to give them super powers

5552
01:27:27,910 --> 01:27:27,920
way to give them super powers
 

5553
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:28,870
way to give them super powers
um

5554
01:27:28,870 --> 01:27:28,880
um
 

5555
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:31,510
um
you know it's the the possibilities that

5556
01:27:31,510 --> 01:27:31,520
you know it's the the possibilities that
 

5557
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:33,430
you know it's the the possibilities that
they can do this if they can really so

5558
01:27:33,430 --> 01:27:33,440
they can do this if they can really so
 

5559
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:35,830
they can do this if they can really so
you know they've already shown that they

5560
01:27:35,830 --> 01:27:35,840
you know they've already shown that they
 

5561
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:36,870
you know they've already shown that they
are for real but you know they've

5562
01:27:36,870 --> 01:27:36,880
are for real but you know they've
 

5563
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:38,390
are for real but you know they've
created this robot

5564
01:27:38,390 --> 01:27:38,400
created this robot
 

5565
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:39,750
created this robot
elon talks about like it should be like

5566
01:27:39,750 --> 01:27:39,760
elon talks about like it should be like
 

5567
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:41,830
elon talks about like it should be like
lasik where it's not

5568
01:27:41,830 --> 01:27:41,840
lasik where it's not
 

5569
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:43,350
lasik where it's not
it shouldn't be something that needs a

5570
01:27:43,350 --> 01:27:43,360
it shouldn't be something that needs a
 

5571
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:46,070
it shouldn't be something that needs a
surgeon this shouldn't just be for rich

5572
01:27:46,070 --> 01:27:46,080
surgeon this shouldn't just be for rich
 

5573
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:47,510
surgeon this shouldn't just be for rich
people who have waited in line for six

5574
01:27:47,510 --> 01:27:47,520
people who have waited in line for six
 

5575
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:49,510
people who have waited in line for six
months it should be for anyone who can

5576
01:27:49,510 --> 01:27:49,520
months it should be for anyone who can
 

5577
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:51,590
months it should be for anyone who can
afford lasik and eventually hopefully

5578
01:27:51,590 --> 01:27:51,600
afford lasik and eventually hopefully
 

5579
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:53,510
afford lasik and eventually hopefully
something that isn't covered by

5580
01:27:53,510 --> 01:27:53,520
something that isn't covered by
 

5581
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:54,629
something that isn't covered by
insurance or you know something that

5582
01:27:54,629 --> 01:27:54,639
insurance or you know something that
 

5583
01:27:54,639 --> 01:27:56,790
insurance or you know something that
anyone can do um something this big a

5584
01:27:56,790 --> 01:27:56,800
anyone can do um something this big a
 

5585
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:58,229
anyone can do um something this big a
deal should be something that anyone can

5586
01:27:58,229 --> 01:27:58,239
deal should be something that anyone can
 

5587
01:27:58,239 --> 01:28:01,510
deal should be something that anyone can
afford eventually and

5588
01:28:01,510 --> 01:28:01,520
afford eventually and
 

5589
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:03,430
afford eventually and
when we have this again i'm talking

5590
01:28:03,430 --> 01:28:03,440
when we have this again i'm talking
 

5591
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:05,270
when we have this again i'm talking
about a very advanced phase down the

5592
01:28:05,270 --> 01:28:05,280
about a very advanced phase down the
 

5593
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:07,669
about a very advanced phase down the
road so maybe a less advanced phase just

5594
01:28:07,669 --> 01:28:07,679
road so maybe a less advanced phase just
 

5595
01:28:07,679 --> 01:28:09,510
road so maybe a less advanced phase just
to just there

5596
01:28:09,510 --> 01:28:09,520
to just there
 

5597
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:11,350
to just there
maybe right now uh if you think about

5598
01:28:11,350 --> 01:28:11,360
maybe right now uh if you think about
 

5599
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:12,470
maybe right now uh if you think about
when you listen to a mute when you

5600
01:28:12,470 --> 01:28:12,480
when you listen to a mute when you
 

5601
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:14,390
when you listen to a mute when you
listen to a song what's happening

5602
01:28:14,390 --> 01:28:14,400
listen to a song what's happening
 

5603
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:17,669
listen to a song what's happening
is do you actually hear the sound well

5604
01:28:17,669 --> 01:28:17,679
is do you actually hear the sound well
 

5605
01:28:17,679 --> 01:28:20,790
is do you actually hear the sound well
not really it's that the sound

5606
01:28:20,790 --> 01:28:20,800
not really it's that the sound
 

5607
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:22,709
not really it's that the sound
is coming out of the speaker the speaker

5608
01:28:22,709 --> 01:28:22,719
is coming out of the speaker the speaker
 

5609
01:28:22,719 --> 01:28:24,310
is coming out of the speaker the speaker
is vibrating it's vibrating air

5610
01:28:24,310 --> 01:28:24,320
is vibrating it's vibrating air
 

5611
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:26,629
is vibrating it's vibrating air
molecules those air molecules you know

5612
01:28:26,629 --> 01:28:26,639
molecules those air molecules you know
 

5613
01:28:26,639 --> 01:28:29,750
molecules those air molecules you know
get vibrated all the way to your head um

5614
01:28:29,750 --> 01:28:29,760
get vibrated all the way to your head um
 

5615
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:32,629
get vibrated all the way to your head um
uh the pressure wave and then

5616
01:28:32,629 --> 01:28:32,639
uh the pressure wave and then
 

5617
01:28:32,639 --> 01:28:35,030
uh the pressure wave and then
it vibrates your eardrum your eardrum is

5618
01:28:35,030 --> 01:28:35,040
it vibrates your eardrum your eardrum is
 

5619
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:37,189
it vibrates your eardrum your eardrum is
really the speaker now in your head that

5620
01:28:37,189 --> 01:28:37,199
really the speaker now in your head that
 

5621
01:28:37,199 --> 01:28:41,830
really the speaker now in your head that
then vibrates bones and fluid which then

5622
01:28:41,830 --> 01:28:41,840
then vibrates bones and fluid which then
 

5623
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:43,990
then vibrates bones and fluid which then
it stimulates neurons in your auditory

5624
01:28:43,990 --> 01:28:44,000
it stimulates neurons in your auditory
 

5625
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:45,990
it stimulates neurons in your auditory
cortex which

5626
01:28:45,990 --> 01:28:46,000
cortex which
 

5627
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,070
cortex which
give you the perception that you're

5628
01:28:48,070 --> 01:28:48,080
give you the perception that you're
 

5629
01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:49,669
give you the perception that you're
hearing sound

5630
01:28:49,669 --> 01:28:49,679
hearing sound
 

5631
01:28:49,679 --> 01:28:52,070
hearing sound
now if you think about that

5632
01:28:52,070 --> 01:28:52,080
now if you think about that
 

5633
01:28:52,080 --> 01:28:53,990
now if you think about that
do we really need to have a speaker to

5634
01:28:53,990 --> 01:28:54,000
do we really need to have a speaker to
 

5635
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,070
do we really need to have a speaker to
do that you could just somehow if you

5636
01:28:56,070 --> 01:28:56,080
do that you could just somehow if you
 

5637
01:28:56,080 --> 01:28:56,950
do that you could just somehow if you
had a little tiny thing that could

5638
01:28:56,950 --> 01:28:56,960
had a little tiny thing that could
 

5639
01:28:56,960 --> 01:28:58,629
had a little tiny thing that could
vibrate ear drums you could do it that

5640
01:28:58,629 --> 01:28:58,639
vibrate ear drums you could do it that
 

5641
01:28:58,639 --> 01:29:01,750
vibrate ear drums you could do it that
way that seems very hard but really what

5642
01:29:01,750 --> 01:29:01,760
way that seems very hard but really what
 

5643
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:03,189
way that seems very hard but really what
you need if you go to the very end but

5644
01:29:03,189 --> 01:29:03,199
you need if you go to the very end but
 

5645
01:29:03,199 --> 01:29:05,030
you need if you go to the very end but
the thing that really needs to happen is

5646
01:29:05,030 --> 01:29:05,040
the thing that really needs to happen is
 

5647
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:07,350
the thing that really needs to happen is
your auditory cortex neurons need to be

5648
01:29:07,350 --> 01:29:07,360
your auditory cortex neurons need to be
 

5649
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:09,510
your auditory cortex neurons need to be
stimulated in a certain way

5650
01:29:09,510 --> 01:29:09,520
stimulated in a certain way
 

5651
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:11,590
stimulated in a certain way
if you have a ton of knurling things in

5652
01:29:11,590 --> 01:29:11,600
if you have a ton of knurling things in
 

5653
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:13,830
if you have a ton of knurling things in
there neural link electrodes and then

5654
01:29:13,830 --> 01:29:13,840
there neural link electrodes and then
 

5655
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:15,110
there neural link electrodes and then
they'll get really good at stimulating

5656
01:29:15,110 --> 01:29:15,120
they'll get really good at stimulating
 

5657

5725
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:15,830
one of the examples elon uses is that
the low bandwidth of speech

5726

the low bandwidth of speech
 

5727
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:17,350
the low bandwidth of speech

and
 

5747
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:34,950
and
i had a much more nuanced experience

5748
01:30:34,950 --> 01:30:34,960
i had a much more nuanced experience
 

5749
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:36,070
i had a much more nuanced experience
than that

5750
01:30:36,070 --> 01:30:36,080
than that
 

5751
01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:38,629
than that
and i don't all i have is you know these

these words right and so instead i just
 

5755
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:41,750
these words right and so instead i just
hand you the bucket

hand you the bucket
 

5757
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:42,870
hand you the bucket
i put the stuff in the head in the

5763
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:47,510
have is the bucket you just have to
guess what what i put into that bucket

5764
01:30:47,510 --> 01:30:47,520
guess what what i put into that bucket
 

5765
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:48,709
guess what what i put into that bucket
all you can do is look at the label of

5766
01:30:48,709 --> 01:30:48,719
all you can do is look at the label of
 

5767
01:30:48,719 --> 01:30:50,870
all you can do is look at the label of
the bucket and say i'll us when i say

01:30:50,870 --> 01:30:50,880
the bucket and say i'll us when i say
 

5769
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:53,350
the bucket and say i'll us when i say
terrifying here's what i mean so the

5770
01:30:53,350 --> 01:30:53,360
terrifying here's what i mean so the
 

5771
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:55,830
terrifying here's what i mean so the
point is it's very lossy i had this all

5772
01:30:55,830 --> 01:30:55,840
point is it's very lossy i had this all
 

5773
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:57,350
point is it's very lossy i had this all
this nuanced information of what i

5774
01:30:57,350 --> 01:30:57,360
this nuanced information of what i
 

5775
01:30:57,360 --> 01:30:58,950
this nuanced information of what i
thought of the movie and i'm sending you

5776
01:30:58,950 --> 01:30:58,960

a very low res package that you're gonna
 

5779
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:03,030
a very low res package that you're gonna
now guess what the high-res thing looked

5780
01:31:03,030 --> 01:31:03,040
now guess what the high-res thing looked
 

5781
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:03,910
now guess what the high-res thing looked
like

5782
01:31:03,910 --> 01:31:03,920
like
 

5783
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:05,910
like
that's language in general our thoughts

5784
01:31:05,910 --> 01:31:05,920
that's language in general our thoughts
 

5785
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:07,750
that's language in general our thoughts
are much more nuanced we can think to

5786
01:31:07,750 --> 01:31:07,760
are much more nuanced we can think to
 

5787
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:09,669
are much more nuanced we can think to
each other we can do amazing things we

like have they joined epiphany and now
how about eight people in a room doing

5816
01:31:31,030 --> 01:31:31,040
how about eight people in a room doing
 

5817
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:33,110
how about eight people in a room doing
it right so it gets you know there's

5818
01:31:33,110 --> 01:31:33,120
it right so it gets you know there's
 

5819
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:34,870
it right so it gets you know there's
other examples how about when you're a

5820
01:31:34,870 --> 01:31:34,880
other examples how about when you're a
 

5821
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:37,510
other examples how about when you're a
dress designer or a bridge designer and

well right now you got to sketch it for

5828
01:31:41,750 --> 01:31:41,760
well right now you got to sketch it for
 

5829
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:43,430
well right now you got to sketch it for
a long time here just beam it onto the

5830
01:31:43,430 --> 01:31:43,440
a long time here just beam it onto the
 

5831
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:44,870
a long time here just beam it onto the
screen from your head so you can picture

5832
01:31:44,870 --> 01:31:44,880
screen from your head so you can picture
 

5833
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:46,390
screen from your head so you can picture
it if you know if you can picture a tree

5834
01:31:46,390 --> 01:31:46,400
it if you know if you can picture a tree
 

5835
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:48,629
it if you know if you can picture a tree
in your head well you can just suddenly

5836
01:31:48,629 --> 01:31:48,639
in your head well you can just suddenly
 

5837
01:31:48,639 --> 01:31:49,590
in your head well you can just suddenly
whatever's in your head you can be

5838
01:31:49,590 --> 01:31:49,600
whatever's in your head you can be
 

5839
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:51,430
whatever's in your head you can be
pictured so we'll have to get very good

5840
01:31:51,430 --> 01:31:51,440
pictured so we'll have to get very good
 

5841
01:31:51,440 --> 01:31:52,790
pictured so we'll have to get very good
at it right and take a skill right you

5842
01:31:52,790 --> 01:31:52,800
at it right and take a skill right you
 

5843
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:54,709
at it right and take a skill right you
know you're gonna have to but the

5844
01:31:54,709 --> 01:31:54,719
know you're gonna have to but the
 

5845
01:31:54,719 --> 01:31:57,430
know you're gonna have to but the
possibilities my god talk about like i

5846
01:31:57,430 --> 01:31:57,440
possibilities my god talk about like i
 

5847
01:31:57,440 --> 01:31:59,669
possibilities my god talk about like i
feel like if that works if we really do

5848
01:31:59,669 --> 01:31:59,679
feel like if that works if we really do
 

5849
01:31:59,679 --> 01:32:01,750
feel like if that works if we really do
have that uh as something i think it'll

5850
01:32:01,750 --> 01:32:01,760
have that uh as something i think it'll
 

5851
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:04,390
have that uh as something i think it'll
almost be like a new adbc line it's such

5852
01:32:04,390 --> 01:32:04,400
almost be like a new adbc line it's such
 

5853
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:06,470
almost be like a new adbc line it's such
a big change that the idea of like

5854
01:32:06,470 --> 01:32:06,480
a big change that the idea of like
 

5855
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:08,310
a big change that the idea of like
anyone living before everyone had brain

5856
01:32:08,310 --> 01:32:08,320
anyone living before everyone had brain
 

5857
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:10,950
anyone living before everyone had brain
machine interfaces is living in

5858
01:32:10,950 --> 01:32:10,960
machine interfaces is living in
 

5859
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:13,110
machine interfaces is living in
like before the common era it's that

5860
01:32:13,110 --> 01:32:13,120
like before the common era it's that
 

5861
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:15,910
like before the common era it's that
level of like big change if it can work

5862
01:32:15,910 --> 01:32:15,920
level of like big change if it can work
 

5863
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:17,830
level of like big change if it can work
yeah and the like replay of memories

5864
01:32:17,830 --> 01:32:17,840
yeah and the like replay of memories
 

5865
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:19,430
yeah and the like replay of memories
just replaying stuff in your head oh my

5866
01:32:19,430 --> 01:32:19,440
just replaying stuff in your head oh my
 

5867
01:32:19,440 --> 01:32:21,590
just replaying stuff in your head oh my
god yeah and and copying you know you

5868
01:32:21,590 --> 01:32:21,600
god yeah and and copying you know you
 

5869
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:23,430
god yeah and and copying you know you
can hopefully copy memories onto other

5870
01:32:23,430 --> 01:32:23,440
can hopefully copy memories onto other
 

5871
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:24,709
can hopefully copy memories onto other
things and you don't have to just rely

5872
01:32:24,709 --> 01:32:24,719
things and you don't have to just rely
 

5873
01:32:24,719 --> 01:32:27,830
things and you don't have to just rely
on your you know your wet circuitry it

5874
01:32:27,830 --> 01:32:27,840
on your you know your wet circuitry it
 

5875
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:29,430
on your you know your wet circuitry it
does make me sad because you're right

5876
01:32:29,430 --> 01:32:29,440
does make me sad because you're right
 

5877
01:32:29,440 --> 01:32:32,149
does make me sad because you're right
the brain is incredibly neuroplastic and

5878
01:32:32,149 --> 01:32:32,159
the brain is incredibly neuroplastic and
 

5879
01:32:32,159 --> 01:32:34,229
the brain is incredibly neuroplastic and
so it can adjust it can learn how to do

5880
01:32:34,229 --> 01:32:34,239
so it can adjust it can learn how to do
 

5881
01:32:34,239 --> 01:32:36,070
so it can adjust it can learn how to do
this i think it'll be a skill but

5882
01:32:36,070 --> 01:32:36,080
this i think it'll be a skill but
 

5883
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:37,990
this i think it'll be a skill but
probably you and i will be too old to

5884
01:32:37,990 --> 01:32:38,000
probably you and i will be too old to

5891
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:44,790
the next three months in like a you know
in one of the neural link trainings but

5892
01:32:44,790 --> 01:32:44,800
in one of the neural link trainings but
 

5893
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:47,430
in one of the neural link trainings but
it'll still be a bit of like grandpa can

all old school yeah once you have the
 

6059
01:35:17,280 --> 01:35:19,910
all old school yeah once you have the
brain interface it'll just be projection

6060
01:35:19,910 --> 01:35:19,920
brain interface it'll just be projection
 

6061
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:20,709

it'll take over my visual cortex my
visual cortex will get put into a

6066
01:35:24,310 --> 01:35:24,320
visual cortex will get put into a
 

6067
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:25,830
visual cortex will get put into a
virtual room and so will yours so we

6068
01:35:25,830 --> 01:35:25,840
virtual room and so will yours so we
 

6069
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:26,870
virtual room and so will yours so we
will see

6070
01:35:26,870 --> 01:35:26,880
will see
 

6071
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:29,350

i'm sure there'll be things where you

6122
01:36:18,950 --> 01:36:18,960
i'm sure there'll be things where you
 

6123
01:36:18,960 --> 01:36:20,229
i'm sure there'll be things where you
can actually smell what's in the room

6124
01:36:20,229 --> 01:36:20,239
can actually smell what's in the room
 

6125
01:36:20,239 --> 01:36:22,470
can actually smell what's in the room
and you can yeah and touch yeah but i

6126
01:36:22,470 --> 01:36:22,480
and you can yeah and touch yeah but i
 

6127
01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:23,750
and you can yeah and touch yeah but i
think that'll be one of the last things

6128
01:36:23,750 --> 01:36:23,760
think that'll be one of the last things
 

6129
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:24,950
think that'll be one of the last things
to go i think there'll be there's

6130
01:36:24,950 --> 01:36:24,960
to go i think there'll be there's
 

6131
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:26,709
to go i think there'll be there's
something

something
 

6133

something
that to me seems like something that'll

6134
01:36:28,149 --> 01:36:28,159
that to me seems like something that'll
 

6135
01:36:28,159 --> 01:36:30,629
that to me seems like something that'll
be um it'd be a while before people feel

6136
01:36:30,629 --> 01:36:30,639
be um it'd be a while before people feel
 

6137
01:36:30,639 --> 01:36:32,550
be um it'd be a while before people feel
like there's nothing lost by not being

6138
01:36:32,550 --> 01:36:32,560
like there's nothing lost by not being
 

6139
01:36:32,560 --> 01:36:34,390
like there's nothing lost by not being
the same it's it's very difficult to

6140
01:36:34,390 --> 01:36:34,400
the same it's it's very difficult to
 

6141
01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:35,990
the same it's it's very difficult to
replicate the human interaction although

6142
01:36:35,990 --> 01:36:36,000
replicate the human interaction although
 

6143
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,470

01:36:42,950 --> 01:36:42,960
have a thing where you you basically um
 

6149
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:44,629
have a thing where you you basically um
you know or you know you're let's just

6150

right you do it and it goes everywhere

6184
01:37:15,590 --> 01:37:15,600
right you do it and it goes everywhere
 

6185
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:17,350
right you do it and it goes everywhere
so it'll be the same idea

6186
01:37:17,350 --> 01:37:17,360
so it'll be the same idea
 

6187
01:37:17,360 --> 01:37:19,669
so it'll be the same idea
uh you've written and thought a lot

6188
01:37:19,669 --> 01:37:19,679
uh you've written and thought a lot
 

6189
01:37:19,679 --> 01:37:21,590
uh you've written and thought a lot
about ai

6190
01:37:21,590 --> 01:37:21,600
about ai
 

6191
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:22,950
about ai
so

6192
01:37:22,950 --> 01:37:22,960
so
 

6193
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:25,590
so
uh ai safety specifically you've uh

6194
01:37:25,590 --> 01:37:25,600
uh ai safety specifically you've uh
 

6195
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:26,790
uh ai safety specifically you've uh
mentioned you're actually starting a

6196
01:37:26,790 --> 01:37:26,800
mentioned you're actually starting a
 

6197
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:28,709
mentioned you're actually starting a
podcast which is awesome you're so good

podcast which is awesome you're so good
at talking so good at thinking so good

6200
01:37:30,790 --> 01:37:30,800
at talking so good at thinking so good
 

6201
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:33,270
at talking so good at thinking so good
at being weird in the most beautiful of

6202
01:37:33,270 --> 01:37:33,280
at being weird in the most beautiful of
 

6203
01:37:33,280 --> 01:37:36,629
at being weird in the most beautiful of
ways uh but you've been thinking about

6204
01:37:36,629 --> 01:37:36,639
ways uh but you've been thinking about
 

6205
01:37:36,639 --> 01:37:38,550
ways uh but you've been thinking about
this ai safety question

6206
01:37:38,550 --> 01:37:38,560
this ai safety question
 

6207
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:39,350
this ai safety question
where

6208
01:37:39,350 --> 01:37:39,360
where
 

6209
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:42,070
where
today does your concern lie for the for

6210
01:37:42,070 --> 01:37:42,080
today does your concern lie for the for
 

6211
01:37:42,080 --> 01:37:43,750
today does your concern lie for the for
the near future for the long term future

like
 

6215
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:46,790
like
quite a bit of stuff happened including

01:38:49,270 --> 01:38:49,280
yeah our emotions can be pulled like
 

6279
01:38:49,280 --> 01:38:50,870
yeah our emotions can be pulled like
puppet strings i mean again i look at

6280
01:38:50,870 --> 01:38:50,880
puppet strings i mean again i look at
 

6281
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:52,149
puppet strings i mean again i look at
like i do look at what's going on

6282
01:38:52,149 --> 01:38:52,159
like i do look at what's going on
 

6283
01:38:52,159 --> 01:38:53,830
like i do look at what's going on
political polarization now and i see a

6284
01:38:53,830 --> 01:38:53,840
political polarization now and i see a
 

6285
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:56,390
political polarization now and i see a
lot of puppet string emotions happening

6286
01:38:56,390 --> 01:38:56,400
lot of puppet string emotions happening
 

6287
01:38:56,400 --> 01:38:58,070
lot of puppet string emotions happening
so yeah there's a lot to be scared of

6288
01:38:58,070 --> 01:38:58,080
so yeah there's a lot to be scared of
 

6289
01:38:58,080 --> 01:39:01,350
so yeah there's a lot to be scared of
for sure like very scared of um i i i

6290
01:39:01,350 --> 01:39:01,360
for sure like very scared of um i i i
 

6291
01:39:01,360 --> 01:39:03,350
for sure like very scared of um i i i
get excited about a lot of very specific

6292
01:39:03,350 --> 01:39:03,360
get excited about a lot of very specific
 

6293
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:04,709
get excited about a lot of very specific
things like one of the things i get

6294
01:39:04,709 --> 01:39:04,719
things like one of the things i get
 

6295
01:39:04,719 --> 01:39:06,790
things like one of the things i get
excited about is i like um so the future

6296
01:39:06,790 --> 01:39:06,800
excited about is i like um so the future
 

6297
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:09,270
excited about is i like um so the future
of wearables right again i think that

6298
01:39:09,270 --> 01:39:09,280
of wearables right again i think that
 

6299
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:10,870
of wearables right again i think that
we're like oh the wrist the fitbit

6300
01:39:10,870 --> 01:39:10,880
we're like oh the wrist the fitbit
 

6301
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:12,229
we're like oh the wrist the fitbit
around my wrist is going to see you know

6302
01:39:12,229 --> 01:39:12,239
around my wrist is going to see you know
 

6303
01:39:12,239 --> 01:39:13,270
around my wrist is going to see you know
the whoop

6304
01:39:13,270 --> 01:39:13,280
the whoop
 

6305
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:14,990
the whoop
is going to seem really

6306
01:39:14,990 --> 01:39:15,000
is going to seem really
 

6307
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:18,790
is going to seem really
hilariously old school in 20 years

6308
01:39:18,790 --> 01:39:18,800
hilariously old school in 20 years
 

6309
01:39:18,800 --> 01:39:21,270
hilariously old school in 20 years
like a big bracelet right it's going to

6310
01:39:21,270 --> 01:39:21,280
like a big bracelet right it's going to
 

6311
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:23,430
like a big bracelet right it's going to
turn into little sensors in our blood

6312
01:39:23,430 --> 01:39:23,440
turn into little sensors in our blood
 

6313
01:39:23,440 --> 01:39:25,109
turn into little sensors in our blood
probably or you know

6314
01:39:25,109 --> 01:39:25,119
probably or you know
 

6315
01:39:25,119 --> 01:39:26,470
probably or you know
even you know infrared we're you know

6316
01:39:26,470 --> 01:39:26,480
even you know infrared we're you know
 

6317
01:39:26,480 --> 01:39:28,390
even you know infrared we're you know
just just just things that are going to

6318
01:39:28,390 --> 01:39:28,400
just just just things that are going to
 

6319
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:30,470
just just just things that are going to
be it's going to be collecting 100 times

6320
01:39:30,470 --> 01:39:30,480
be it's going to be collecting 100 times
 

6321
01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:31,750
be it's going to be collecting 100 times
more data than it collects now more

6322
01:39:31,750 --> 01:39:31,760
more data than it collects now more
 

6323
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:34,310
more data than it collects now more
nuanced data more specific to our body

6324
01:39:34,310 --> 01:39:34,320
nuanced data more specific to our body
 

6325
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:36,070
nuanced data more specific to our body
and it's going to be you know super

6326
01:39:36,070 --> 01:39:36,080
and it's going to be you know super
 

6327
01:39:36,080 --> 01:39:37,990
and it's going to be you know super
reliable but that's the hardware side

6328
01:39:37,990 --> 01:39:38,000
reliable but that's the hardware side
 

6329
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,229
reliable but that's the hardware side
and then the software is going to be

6330
01:39:40,229 --> 01:39:40,239
and then the software is going to be
 

6331
01:39:40,239 --> 01:39:41,590
and then the software is going to be
this is i've not done my deep dive this

6332
01:39:41,590 --> 01:39:41,600
this is i've not done my deep dive this
 

6333
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:43,510
this is i've not done my deep dive this
is all speculation but

6334
01:39:43,510 --> 01:39:43,520
is all speculation but
 

6335
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:44,870
is all speculation but
the software is going to get really good

6336
01:39:44,870 --> 01:39:44,880
the software is going to get really good
 

6337
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:46,709
the software is going to get really good
and this is the ai component

6338
01:39:46,709 --> 01:39:46,719
and this is the ai component
 

6339
01:39:46,719 --> 01:39:48,550
and this is the ai component
and so i get excited about specific

6340
01:39:48,550 --> 01:39:48,560
and so i get excited about specific
 

6341
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:50,470
and so i get excited about specific
things like that like think about if if

6342
01:39:50,470 --> 01:39:50,480
things like that like think about if if
 

6343
01:39:50,480 --> 01:39:52,070
things like that like think about if if
you're if

6344
01:39:52,070 --> 01:39:52,080
you're if
 

6345
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:54,550
you're if
if hardware were able to collect

6346
01:39:54,550 --> 01:39:54,560
if hardware were able to collect
 

6347
01:39:54,560 --> 01:39:55,590
if hardware were able to collect
first of all the hardware knows your

6348
01:39:55,590 --> 01:39:55,600
first of all the hardware knows your
 

6349
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:57,350
first of all the hardware knows your
whole genome and

6350
01:39:57,350 --> 01:39:57,360
whole genome and
 

6351
01:39:57,360 --> 01:39:59,590
whole genome and
we know a lot more about what a genome

6352
01:39:59,590 --> 01:39:59,600
we know a lot more about what a genome
 

6353
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:01,430
we know a lot more about what a genome
sequence means because you can collect

6354
01:40:01,430 --> 01:40:01,440
sequence means because you can collect
 

6355
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:04,149
sequence means because you can collect
your genome now and we just don't know

6356
01:40:04,149 --> 01:40:04,159
your genome now and we just don't know
 

6357
01:40:04,159 --> 01:40:05,350
your genome now and we just don't know
we okay we don't have much to do with

6358
01:40:05,350 --> 01:40:05,360
we okay we don't have much to do with
 

6359
01:40:05,360 --> 01:40:06,870
we okay we don't have much to do with
that information

6360
01:40:06,870 --> 01:40:06,880
that information
 

6361
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:09,030
that information
as ai gets so now you have your genome

6362
01:40:09,030 --> 01:40:09,040
as ai gets so now you have your genome
 

6363
01:40:09,040 --> 01:40:10,550
as ai gets so now you have your genome
you've got what's in your blood at any

6364
01:40:10,550 --> 01:40:10,560
you've got what's in your blood at any
 

6365
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:11,830
you've got what's in your blood at any
given moment all the levels of

that ever visited your body because
 

6379
01:40:22,880 --> 01:40:24,629
that ever visited your body because
there's a trace of it so you have all

6380
01:40:24,629 --> 01:40:24,639
there's a trace of it so you have all
 

6381
01:40:24,639 --> 01:40:27,430
there's a trace of it so you have all
the pathogens all the things that like

01:40:27,430 --> 01:40:27,440
the pathogens all the things that like
 

6383
01:40:27,440 --> 01:40:28,470

you should be concerned about

6384
01:40:28,470 --> 01:40:28,480
you should be concerned about
 

6385
01:40:28,480 --> 01:40:29,910
you should be concerned about
health-wise and might might have

01:40:29,910 --> 01:40:29,920
health-wise and might might have
 

6387
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:31,750
health-wise and might might have
threatened you you might be immune from

threatened you you might be immune from
 

6389
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:33,510
threatened you you might be immune from
all that kind of stuff also of course it

6390
01:40:33,510 --> 01:40:33,520
all that kind of stuff also of course it
 

6391
01:40:33,520 --> 01:40:35,590
all that kind of stuff also of course it
knows how fast your heart is beating and

6392
01:40:35,590 --> 01:40:35,600
knows how fast your heart is beating and
 

6393
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:37,590
knows how fast your heart is beating and
it knows how much you you know exactly

6394
01:40:37,590 --> 01:40:37,600
it knows how much you you know exactly
 

6395
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:39,669
it knows how much you you know exactly
the amount of exercise uh it knows your

6396
01:40:39,669 --> 01:40:39,679
the amount of exercise uh it knows your
 

6397
01:40:39,679 --> 01:40:40,950
the amount of exercise uh it knows your
muscle mass and your weight and all that

6398
01:40:40,950 --> 01:40:40,960
muscle mass and your weight and all that
 

6399
01:40:40,960 --> 01:40:42,310
muscle mass and your weight and all that
but it also maybe you can even know your

6400
01:40:42,310 --> 01:40:42,320
but it also maybe you can even know your
 

6401
01:40:42,320 --> 01:40:44,070
but it also maybe you can even know your
emotions i mean make if emotions you

6402
01:40:44,070 --> 01:40:44,080
emotions i mean make if emotions you
 

6403
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:45,030
emotions i mean make if emotions you
know what are they you know where do

6404
01:40:45,030 --> 01:40:45,040
know what are they you know where do
 

6405
01:40:45,040 --> 01:40:46,950
know what are they you know where do
they come from probably pretty obvious

6406
01:40:46,950 --> 01:40:46,960
they come from probably pretty obvious
 

6407
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:48,790
they come from probably pretty obvious
chemicals once we get in there um so

6408
01:40:48,790 --> 01:40:48,800
chemicals once we get in there um so
 

6409
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:50,229
chemicals once we get in there um so
again neuralink can be involved here

6410
01:40:50,229 --> 01:40:50,239
again neuralink can be involved here
 

6411
01:40:50,239 --> 01:40:52,229
again neuralink can be involved here
maybe in collecting information

6412
01:40:52,229 --> 01:40:52,239
maybe in collecting information
 

6413
01:40:52,239 --> 01:40:53,510
maybe in collecting information
um you know because right now you have

6414
01:40:53,510 --> 01:40:53,520
um you know because right now you have
 

6415
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:54,629
um you know because right now you have
to do the thing what's your mood right

6416
01:40:54,629 --> 01:40:54,639
to do the thing what's your mood right
 

6417
01:40:54,639 --> 01:40:55,990
to do the thing what's your mood right
now and it's hard to even assess you

6418
01:40:55,990 --> 01:40:56,000
now and it's hard to even assess you
 

6419
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:57,350
now and it's hard to even assess you
know you're in a bad mood it's hard to

6420
01:40:57,350 --> 01:40:57,360
know you're in a bad mood it's hard to
 

6421
01:40:57,360 --> 01:40:59,990
know you're in a bad mood it's hard to
even but uh by the way just as a shout

01:40:59,990 --> 01:41:00,000
even but uh by the way just as a shout

who does none of that right
so that that is a massive loss a massive

7718
02:01:26,950 --> 02:01:26,960
so that that is a massive loss a massive
 

7719
02:01:26,960 --> 02:01:29,109
so that that is a massive loss a massive
loss and it's because

7720
02:01:29,109 --> 02:01:29,119
loss and it's because
 

7721
02:01:29,119 --> 02:01:31,990
loss and it's because
um the internal mechanism in their brain

7722
02:01:31,990 --> 02:01:32,000
um the internal mechanism in their brain
 

7723
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:33,910
um the internal mechanism in their brain
is not doing what the other person's is

7724
02:01:33,910 --> 02:01:33,920
is not doing what the other person's is
 

7725
02:01:33,920 --> 02:01:35,990
is not doing what the other person's is
they don't have the respect for the the

7726
02:01:35,990 --> 02:01:36,000
they don't have the respect for the the
 

7727
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:37,990
they don't have the respect for the the
part of them that made the choice they

7728
02:01:37,990 --> 02:01:38,000
part of them that made the choice they
 

7729
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:38,870
part of them that made the choice they
feel like it's someone they can

7730
02:01:38,870 --> 02:01:38,880
feel like it's someone they can
 

7731
02:01:38,880 --> 02:01:41,669
feel like it's someone they can
disregard and so to me is this in the

7732
02:01:41,669 --> 02:01:41,679
disregard and so to me is this in the
 

7733
02:01:41,679 --> 02:01:44,709
disregard and so to me is this in the
same boat as someone who

7734
02:01:44,709 --> 02:01:44,719
same boat as someone who
 

7735
02:01:44,719 --> 02:01:47,109
same boat as someone who
is obese because their eating habits

7736
02:01:47,109 --> 02:01:47,119
is obese because their eating habits
 

7737
02:01:47,119 --> 02:01:48,310
is obese because their eating habits
make them

7738
02:01:48,310 --> 02:01:48,320
make them
 

7739
02:01:48,320 --> 02:01:50,950
make them
obese over time or their exercise habits

7740
02:01:50,950 --> 02:01:50,960
obese over time or their exercise habits
 

7741
02:01:50,960 --> 02:01:52,070
obese over time or their exercise habits
um

7742
02:01:52,070 --> 02:01:52,080

7743
02:01:52,080 --> 02:01:53,830
um
that you know that's a huge loss for

02:01:53,830 --> 02:01:53,840
that you know that's a huge loss for
 

7745

that you know that's a huge loss for
that person that person is is is you

7746
02:01:55,510 --> 02:01:55,520
that person that person is is is you
 

7747
02:01:55,520 --> 02:01:57,189
that person that person is is is you
know the health problems and it's just

7748
02:01:57,189 --> 02:01:57,199
know the health problems and it's just
 

7749
02:01:57,199 --> 02:01:59,910
know the health problems and it's just
probably making them miserable um and

7750
02:01:59,910 --> 02:01:59,920
probably making them miserable um and
 

7751
02:01:59,920 --> 02:02:02,070
probably making them miserable um and
it's and it's self-inflicted right it's

7752
02:02:02,070 --> 02:02:02,080
it's and it's self-inflicted right it's
 

7753
02:02:02,080 --> 02:02:03,750
it's and it's self-inflicted right it's
it's self-defeating but

7754
02:02:03,750 --> 02:02:03,760
it's self-defeating but
 

7755
02:02:03,760 --> 02:02:05,990
it's self-defeating but
that doesn't make an easy problem to fix

7756
02:02:05,990 --> 02:02:06,000
that doesn't make an easy problem to fix
 

7757
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:07,350
that doesn't make an easy problem to fix
just because you're doing it to yourself

7758
02:02:07,350 --> 02:02:07,360
just because you're doing it to yourself

there's duct tape things you know you
 

7989
02:05:37,599 --> 02:05:38,950
there's duct tape things you know you
can do things you know people do there's

8003
02:05:49,360 --> 02:05:51,350
that's you would put that in the
category of duct tape solutions

8004
02:05:51,350 --> 02:05:51,360
category of duct tape solutions
 

8005
02:05:51,360 --> 02:05:53,669

yeah because it because it's not

8029
02:06:12,719 --> 02:06:14,069
won't have done it something weird is
going on there's some resistance there's

8030
02:06:14,069 --> 02:06:14,079
going on there's some resistance there's
 

8031
02:06:14,079 --> 02:06:16,390
going on there's some resistance there's
some force that is prevent that is in my

8032
02:06:16,390 --> 02:06:16,400
some force that is prevent that is in my
 

8033
02:06:16,400 --> 02:06:17,669
some force that is prevent that is in my
own way right

8034
02:06:17,669 --> 02:06:17,679
own way right
 

8035
02:06:17,679 --> 02:06:19,030
own way right
and so

8036
02:06:19,030 --> 02:06:19,040
and so
 

8037

this money okay now i'll panic and i'll

8040
02:06:22,069 --> 02:06:22,079
this money okay now i'll panic and i'll
 

8041
02:06:22,079 --> 02:06:23,750
this money okay now i'll panic and i'll
do it so that's duct tape

8042
02:06:23,750 --> 02:06:23,760
do it so that's duct tape
 

8043
02:06:23,760 --> 02:06:25,589
do it so that's duct tape

in some ways i've gotten really
 

8063
02:06:41,040 --> 02:06:42,870
in some ways i've gotten really
successful at solving it in other ways

8064
02:06:42,870 --> 02:06:42,880
successful at solving it in other ways

we're supposed to you know conserve
energy and like fulfill our needs as we

8360
02:11:04,470 --> 02:11:04,480
energy and like fulfill our needs as we
 

8361
02:11:04,480 --> 02:11:06,550
energy and like fulfill our needs as we
need them and like do immediate things

8362
02:11:06,550 --> 02:11:06,560
need them and like do immediate things
 

8363
02:11:06,560 --> 02:11:07,510
need them and like do immediate things
and

8364
02:11:07,510 --> 02:11:07,520
and
 

8365
02:11:07,520 --> 02:11:10,149
and
um we're overriding our natural ways

8366
02:11:10,149 --> 02:11:10,159
um we're overriding our natural ways
 

8367
02:11:10,159 --> 02:11:12,069
um we're overriding our natural ways
when we wake up and get to it and i

8368
02:11:12,069 --> 02:11:12,079
when we wake up and get to it and i
 

8369
02:11:12,079 --> 02:11:14,310
when we wake up and get to it and i
think sometimes because the the pain i

8370
02:11:14,310 --> 02:11:14,320
think sometimes because the the pain i
 

8371
02:11:14,320 --> 02:11:15,430
think sometimes because the the pain i
think a lot of times we're just avoiding

8372
02:11:15,430 --> 02:11:15,440
think a lot of times we're just avoiding
 

8373
02:11:15,440 --> 02:11:16,709
think a lot of times we're just avoiding
suffering and a lot for a lot of people

8374
02:11:16,709 --> 02:11:16,719
suffering and a lot for a lot of people
 

8375
02:11:16,719 --> 02:11:18,870
suffering and a lot for a lot of people
the pain of not doing it is actually

8376
02:11:18,870 --> 02:11:18,880
the pain of not doing it is actually
 

8377
02:11:18,880 --> 02:11:20,870
the pain of not doing it is actually
worse because they feel shame so if they

8378
02:11:20,870 --> 02:11:20,880
worse because they feel shame so if they
 

8379
02:11:20,880 --> 02:11:22,390
worse because they feel shame so if they
don't get up and take a jog and get up

8380
02:11:22,390 --> 02:11:22,400
don't get up and take a jog and get up
 

8381
02:11:22,400 --> 02:11:24,310
don't get up and take a jog and get up
early and get to work i'll feel like a

8382
02:11:24,310 --> 02:11:24,320
early and get to work i'll feel like a
 

8383
02:11:24,320 --> 02:11:25,669
early and get to work i'll feel like a
bad person

8384
02:11:25,669 --> 02:11:25,679
bad person
 

8385
02:11:25,679 --> 02:11:27,510
bad person
and that is worse than doing those

8386
02:11:27,510 --> 02:11:27,520
and that is worse than doing those
 

8387
02:11:27,520 --> 02:11:28,950
and that is worse than doing those
things and then it becomes a habit

8388
02:11:28,950 --> 02:11:28,960
things and then it becomes a habit
 

8389
02:11:28,960 --> 02:11:30,310
things and then it becomes a habit
eventually and it becomes just easy

8390
02:11:30,310 --> 02:11:30,320
eventually and it becomes just easy
 

8391
02:11:30,320 --> 02:11:32,229
eventually and it becomes just easy
automatic it becomes i do it because

8392
02:11:32,229 --> 02:11:32,239
automatic it becomes i do it because
 

8393
02:11:32,239 --> 02:11:33,990
automatic it becomes i do it because
that's what i do but i think that if you

8394
02:11:33,990 --> 02:11:34,000
that's what i do but i think that if you
 

8395
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,629
that's what i do but i think that if you
don't have a lot of shame necessarily

8396
02:11:36,629 --> 02:11:36,639
don't have a lot of shame necessarily
 

8397
02:11:36,639 --> 02:11:38,470
don't have a lot of shame necessarily
the pain of doing those things is worse

8398
02:11:38,470 --> 02:11:38,480
the pain of doing those things is worse
 

8399
02:11:38,480 --> 02:11:41,030
the pain of doing those things is worse
in that in the immediate moment than

8400
02:11:41,030 --> 02:11:41,040
in that in the immediate moment than
 

8401
02:11:41,040 --> 02:11:42,870
in that in the immediate moment than
not doing it and yeah but i think that

8402
02:11:42,870 --> 02:11:42,880
not doing it and yeah but i think that
 

8403
02:11:42,880 --> 02:11:45,109
not doing it and yeah but i think that
there's this feeling that you captured

8404
02:11:45,109 --> 02:11:45,119
there's this feeling that you captured
 

8405
02:11:45,119 --> 02:11:47,750
there's this feeling that you captured
with your body language and so on

8406
02:11:47,750 --> 02:11:47,760
with your body language and so on
 

8407
02:11:47,760 --> 02:11:49,990
with your body language and so on
like the i don't want to do another set

8408
02:11:49,990 --> 02:11:50,000
like the i don't want to do another set
 

8409
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:51,589
like the i don't want to do another set
that feeling

8410
02:11:51,589 --> 02:11:51,599
that feeling
 

8411
02:11:51,599 --> 02:11:53,750
that feeling
the people i've seen that are good at

8412
02:11:53,750 --> 02:11:53,760
the people i've seen that are good at
 

8413
02:11:53,760 --> 02:11:55,589
the people i've seen that are good at
not procrastinating are the ones that

8414
02:11:55,589 --> 02:11:55,599
not procrastinating are the ones that
 

8415
02:11:55,599 --> 02:11:57,589
not procrastinating are the ones that
have trained themselves to like the

8416
02:11:57,589 --> 02:11:57,599
have trained themselves to like the
 

8417
02:11:57,599 --> 02:11:59,910
have trained themselves to like the
moment they would be having that feeling

8418
02:11:59,910 --> 02:11:59,920
moment they would be having that feeling
 

8419
02:11:59,920 --> 02:12:02,310

running an algorithm like you know this
 

8441
02:12:22,880 --> 02:12:24,870
running an algorithm like you know this
you should be doing this not because

8442

you should be doing this not because
 

8443
02:12:24,880 --> 02:12:26,709
you should be doing this not because

the thing you want to do like look at
 

8447
02:12:28,800 --> 02:12:30,550
the thing you want to do like look at
the big picture of your life and just

8448
02:12:30,550 --> 02:12:30,560
the big picture of your life and just
 

8449
02:12:30,560 --> 02:12:32,229
the big picture of your life and just
run the algorithm like ignore your

8450
02:12:32,229 --> 02:12:32,239
run the algorithm like ignore your
 

8451
02:12:32,239 --> 02:12:34,229
run the algorithm like ignore your
feelings just run as if it's framing

8452
02:12:34,229 --> 02:12:34,239
feelings just run as if it's framing
 

8453
02:12:34,239 --> 02:12:36,390
feelings just run as if it's framing
frame it differently yeah you know yeah

8454
02:12:36,390 --> 02:12:36,400
frame it differently yeah you know yeah
 

8455
02:12:36,400 --> 02:12:38,310
frame it differently yeah you know yeah
you can frame it as like it can feel

8456
02:12:38,310 --> 02:12:38,320
you can frame it as like it can feel
 

8457
02:12:38,320 --> 02:12:40,870
you can frame it as like it can feel
like homework or it can feel like you're

8458
02:12:40,870 --> 02:12:40,880
like homework or it can feel like you're
 

8459
02:12:40,880 --> 02:12:42,390
like homework or it can feel like you're
like you're living your best life or

8460
02:12:42,390 --> 02:12:42,400
like you're living your best life or
 

8461
02:12:42,400 --> 02:12:43,830
like you're living your best life or
something when you're doing your work

8462
02:12:43,830 --> 02:12:43,840
something when you're doing your work
 

8463
02:12:43,840 --> 02:12:46,470
something when you're doing your work
yeah um and maybe you reframe it but i

8464
02:12:46,470 --> 02:12:46,480
yeah um and maybe you reframe it but i
 

8465
02:12:46,480 --> 02:12:48,550
yeah um and maybe you reframe it but i
think ultimately is whatever reframing

8466
02:12:48,550 --> 02:12:48,560
think ultimately is whatever reframing
 

8467
02:12:48,560 --> 02:12:50,550
think ultimately is whatever reframing
you need to do you just need to do it

8468
02:12:50,550 --> 02:12:50,560
you need to do you just need to do it
 

8469
02:12:50,560 --> 02:12:52,229
you need to do you just need to do it
for a few weeks

8470
02:12:52,229 --> 02:12:52,239
for a few weeks
 

8471
02:12:52,239 --> 02:12:53,510
for a few weeks
and

8472
02:12:53,510 --> 02:12:53,520
and
 

8473
02:12:53,520 --> 02:12:55,589
and
that's how the habit is formed and you

8474
02:12:55,589 --> 02:12:55,599
that's how the habit is formed and you
 

8475
02:12:55,599 --> 02:12:58,470
that's how the habit is formed and you
stick with it like um

8476
02:12:58,470 --> 02:12:58,480
stick with it like um
 

8477
02:12:58,480 --> 02:12:59,830
stick with it like um
i've

become way way easier
 

8493
02:13:14,239 --> 02:13:17,270
become way way easier
because of the habit and i just um

8494
02:13:17,270 --> 02:13:17,280
because of the habit and i just um
 

8495
02:13:17,280 --> 02:13:19,510
because of the habit and i just um
and i don't like at least with exercise

and i don't like at least with exercise
 

8497
02:13:19,520 --> 02:13:21,430
and i don't like at least with exercise
because it's easier to replicate that

8498
02:13:21,430 --> 02:13:21,440
because it's easier to replicate that
 

8499
02:13:21,440 --> 02:13:24,149
because it's easier to replicate that
feeling i don't allow myself to go like

instant gratification monkey now that's
 

8555
02:14:08,400 --> 02:14:09,830
instant gratification monkey now that's
what i've labeled him right and um

8556
02:14:09,830 --> 02:14:09,840
what i've labeled him right and um
 

8557
02:14:09,840 --> 02:14:11,189
what i've labeled him right and um
there's the rational decision maker and

8558
02:14:11,189 --> 02:14:11,199
there's the rational decision maker and
 

8559
02:14:11,199 --> 02:14:12,470

the instant gratification monkey and
 

8561
02:14:12,480 --> 02:14:15,189
the instant gratification monkey and
these battle with each other um but the

these battle with each other um but the
 

8563
02:14:15,199 --> 02:14:16,790
these battle with each other um but the
for procrastinator the

monkey wins yeah i think the monkeys you
 

8567
02:14:19,599 --> 02:14:21,270
monkey wins yeah i think the monkeys you
know if we you know you read about this

8568
02:14:21,270 --> 02:14:21,280
know if we you know you read about this
 

8569
02:14:21,280 --> 02:14:22,950
know if we you know you read about this
kind of stuff i think that the

8570
02:14:22,950 --> 02:14:22,960
kind of stuff i think that the
 

8571
02:14:22,960 --> 02:14:25,750
kind of stuff i think that the
this kind of more primitive brain

8572
02:14:25,750 --> 02:14:25,760
this kind of more primitive brain
 

8573
02:14:25,760 --> 02:14:27,189
this kind of more primitive brain
is always winning and in the

8574
02:14:27,189 --> 02:14:27,199
is always winning and in the
 

8575
02:14:27,199 --> 02:14:28,870
is always winning and in the
non-procrastinators that primitive brain

8576
02:14:28,870 --> 02:14:28,880
non-procrastinators that primitive brain
 

8577
02:14:28,880 --> 02:14:30,790
non-procrastinators that primitive brain
is on board for some reason

8578
02:14:30,790 --> 02:14:30,800
is on board for some reason
 

8579
02:14:30,800 --> 02:14:31,589
is on board for some reason
um

8580
02:14:31,589 --> 02:14:31,599
um
 

8581
02:14:31,599 --> 02:14:33,430
um
and isn't resisting so but but when i

02:14:33,430 --> 02:14:33,440
and isn't resisting so but but when i
 

8583
02:14:33,440 --> 02:14:35,189
and isn't resisting so but but when i
think about brushing my teeth it's like

8584
02:14:35,189 --> 02:14:35,199
think about brushing my teeth it's like
 

8585
02:14:35,199 --> 02:14:37,109
think about brushing my teeth it's like
the monkey doesn't even think there's an

8586

the monkey doesn't even think there's an
 

8587
02:14:37,119 --> 02:14:38,950
the monkey doesn't even think there's an
option to not do it so it doesn't even

8588
02:14:38,950 --> 02:14:38,960
option to not do it so it doesn't even
 

8589
02:14:38,960 --> 02:14:40,629
option to not do it so it doesn't even
like get there's no hope the monkey has

8590
02:14:40,629 --> 02:14:40,639
like get there's no hope the monkey has
 

8591
02:14:40,639 --> 02:14:42,310
like get there's no hope the monkey has
no hope there so it doesn't even like

8592
02:14:42,310 --> 02:14:42,320
no hope there so it doesn't even like
 

8593
02:14:42,320 --> 02:14:43,830
no hope there so it doesn't even like
get involved and it's just like yeah now

we have to just like kind of like
 

8597
02:14:44,719 --> 02:14:46,310
we have to just like kind of like
robotically just like

8598
02:14:46,310 --> 02:14:46,320
robotically just like
 

8599
