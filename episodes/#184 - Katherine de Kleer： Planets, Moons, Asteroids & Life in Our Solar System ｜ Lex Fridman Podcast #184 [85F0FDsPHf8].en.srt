99
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,789

so i get asked this all the time i think

100
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:38,799
so i get asked this all the time i think
 

101
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,789
so i get asked this all the time i think
all planetary scientists get asked about

102
00:01:40,789 --> 00:01:40,799
all planetary scientists get asked about
 

103
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,030
all planetary scientists get asked about
pluto especially by kids who

104
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:43,040
pluto especially by kids who
 

105
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,710
pluto especially by kids who
would just love for pluto to still be a

106
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:44,720
would just love for pluto to still be a
 

107
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,149
would just love for pluto to still be a
planet um

108
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:46,159
planet um
 

109
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,469
planet um
but the the reality is um when we first

110
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:50,479
but the the reality is um when we first
 

111
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,870
but the the reality is um when we first
discovered pluto it was it was a unique

112
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:52,880
discovered pluto it was it was a unique
 

113
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,550
discovered pluto it was it was a unique
object in the outer solar system and we

114
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:54,560
object in the outer solar system and we
 

115
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,109
object in the outer solar system and we
thought

116
00:01:55,109 --> 00:01:55,119
thought
 

117
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,270
thought
you know we were adding a planet to the

118
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:57,280
you know we were adding a planet to the
 

119
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,950
you know we were adding a planet to the
inventory of planets that we had and

120
00:01:58,950 --> 00:01:58,960
inventory of planets that we had and
 

121
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,270
inventory of planets that we had and
then

122
00:01:59,270 --> 00:01:59,280
then
 

123
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,830
then
over time it became clear that pluto was

124
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:01,840
over time it became clear that pluto was
 

125
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,030
over time it became clear that pluto was
not

126
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:03,040
not
 

127
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,270
not
a unique large object in the outer solar

128
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:05,280
a unique large object in the outer solar
 

129
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,870
a unique large object in the outer solar
system that there were actually

130
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:06,880
system that there were actually
 

131
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,510
system that there were actually
many of these and as we started

132
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:09,520
many of these and as we started
 

133
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,869
many of these and as we started
discovering more and more of them we

134
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:10,879
discovering more and more of them we
 

135
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:12,869
discovering more and more of them we
realized that the concept of pluto being

136
00:02:12,869 --> 00:02:12,879
realized that the concept of pluto being
 

137
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,150
realized that the concept of pluto being
a planet

138
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:14,160
a planet
 

139
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,190
a planet
um didn't make sense unless maybe we

140
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:17,200
um didn't make sense unless maybe we
 

141
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,949
um didn't make sense unless maybe we
added all the rest of them as planets so

142
00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:18,959
added all the rest of them as planets so
 

143
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,070
added all the rest of them as planets so
you know you could have imagined

144
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:20,080
you know you could have imagined
 

145
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,430
you know you could have imagined
actually a different direction that this

146
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:21,440
actually a different direction that this
 

147
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:21,990
actually a different direction that this
could have gone

148
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,000
could have gone
 

149
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,229
could have gone
where all the other objects that were

150
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:24,239
where all the other objects that were
 

151
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:25,510
where all the other objects that were
discovered in that belt

152
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:25,520
discovered in that belt
 

153
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,350
discovered in that belt
or at least all the ones let's say above

154
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:27,360
or at least all the ones let's say above
 

155
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,869
or at least all the ones let's say above
above a certain size

156
00:02:28,869 --> 00:02:28,879
above a certain size
 

157
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,030
above a certain size
became planets instead of pluto being

158
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:31,040
became planets instead of pluto being
 

159

00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:35,920
but we were now aware of many objects
 

163
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,430

of the same size or in some cases even
larger than pluto

170
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:43,360
larger than pluto
 

171
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,309
larger than pluto
um so the the declassification was

172
00:02:46,309 --> 00:02:46,319
um so the the declassification was
 

173
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,070
um so the the declassification was
really just a realization that it was

174
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:48,080
really just a realization that it was
 

175
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,350
really just a realization that it was
not

176
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:49,360
not
 

177
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,190
not
in the same category as the other

178
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:51,200
in the same category as the other
 

179
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,790
in the same category as the other
planets in the solar system and we

180
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:52,800
planets in the solar system and we
 

181
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,550
planets in the solar system and we
basically needed to refine our

182
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:54,560
basically needed to refine our
 

183
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,670
basically needed to refine our
definition

184
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:55,680
definition
 

185
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,270
definition
in such a way that took into account

186
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:57,280
in such a way that took into account
 

187
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,869
in such a way that took into account
that there's this this

188
00:02:58,869 --> 00:02:58,879
that there's this this
 

189
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,750
that there's this this
belt of debris out there in the outer

190
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:01,760
belt of debris out there in the outer
 

191
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,270
belt of debris out there in the outer
solar system of things with a range of

192
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:03,280
solar system of things with a range of
 

193
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,229
solar system of things with a range of
sizes

194
00:03:04,229 --> 00:03:04,239
sizes
 

195
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,630
sizes
um is there a hope for clear

196
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:06,640
um is there a hope for clear
 

197
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,830
um is there a hope for clear
categorization

198
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:07,840
categorization
 

199
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,149
categorization
of what is a planet and not give us or

200
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:10,159
of what is a planet and not give us or
 

201
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,670
of what is a planet and not give us or
is it all just gray area

202
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:11,680
is it all just gray area
 

203
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,430
is it all just gray area
when you study planets when you study

204
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:13,440
when you study planets when you study
 

205
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,509
when you study planets when you study
moons satellites of those planets

206
00:03:15,509 --> 00:03:15,519
moons satellites of those planets
 

207
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,390
moons satellites of those planets
is there lines that are cl that could be

208
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:18,400
is there lines that are cl that could be
 

209
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,190
is there lines that are cl that could be
cleanly drawn or is it just a giant mess

210
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:21,200
cleanly drawn or is it just a giant mess
 

211
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,589
cleanly drawn or is it just a giant mess
this is all like a fluid let's say not

212
00:03:23,589 --> 00:03:23,599
this is all like a fluid let's say not
 

213
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,670
this is all like a fluid let's say not
mess but it's like fluid

214
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:25,680
mess but it's like fluid
 

215
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,670
mess but it's like fluid
uh of what is a planet what is the moon

216
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:27,680
uh of what is a planet what is the moon
 

217
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,430
uh of what is a planet what is the moon
of a planet what is debris

218
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:29,440
of a planet what is debris
 

219
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,630
of a planet what is debris
what is asteroids all that kind of so

220
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:32,640
what is asteroids all that kind of so
 

221
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,030
what is asteroids all that kind of so
there

222
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:33,040
there
 

223
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,270
there
are technically clear definitions that

224
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:35,280
are technically clear definitions that
 

225
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,190
are technically clear definitions that
were set down by the iau

226
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:37,200
were set down by the iau
 

227
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,229
were set down by the iau
the international astronomy union

228
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:40,239
the international astronomy union
 

229
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,430
the international astronomy union
um is it size related like what are the

230
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:43,440
um is it size related like what are the
 

231
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,270
um is it size related like what are the
parameters based on so the parameters

232
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:45,280
parameters based on so the parameters
 

233
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:45,589
parameters based on so the parameters
are

234
00:03:45,589 --> 00:03:45,599
are
 

235
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,910
are
that it has to orbit the sun which was

236
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:47,920
that it has to orbit the sun which was
 

237
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,670
that it has to orbit the sun which was
essentially to rule out satellites of

238
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:49,680
essentially to rule out satellites of
 

239
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,789
essentially to rule out satellites of
course this was a

240
00:03:50,789 --> 00:03:50,799
course this was a
 

241
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,550
course this was a
not very forward-thinking definition

242
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:52,560
not very forward-thinking definition
 

243
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,990
not very forward-thinking definition
because it technically means that all

244
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:54,000
because it technically means that all
 

245
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,589
because it technically means that all
extrasolar planets according to that

246
00:03:55,589 --> 00:03:55,599
extrasolar planets according to that
 

247
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,429
extrasolar planets according to that
definition are not planets

248
00:03:57,429 --> 00:03:57,439
definition are not planets
 

249
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,149
definition are not planets
um so it has to order uh orbit the sun

250
00:04:00,149 --> 00:04:00,159
um so it has to order uh orbit the sun
 

251
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:00,949
um so it has to order uh orbit the sun
it has to be

252
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:00,959
it has to be
 

253
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,949
it has to be
large enough that its gravity has caused

254
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:02,959
large enough that its gravity has caused
 

255
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,589
large enough that its gravity has caused
it to become spherical in shape

256
00:04:05,589 --> 00:04:05,599
it to become spherical in shape
 

257
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,110
it to become spherical in shape
which also applies to satellites and

258
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:07,120
which also applies to satellites and
 

259
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,110
which also applies to satellites and
also applies to pluto the third part of

260
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:09,120
also applies to pluto the third part of
 

261
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,550
also applies to pluto the third part of
the definition is the thing that really

262
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:10,560
the definition is the thing that really
 

263
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,830
the definition is the thing that really
rules out everything else which is that

264
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:11,840
rules out everything else which is that
 

265
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,630
rules out everything else which is that
it has to has

266
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:12,640
it has to has
 

267
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,670
it has to has
have cleared out its orbital path um

268
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:15,680
have cleared out its orbital path um
 

269
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,830
have cleared out its orbital path um
and because pluto orbits in a belt of

270
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:17,840
and because pluto orbits in a belt of
 

271
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,509
and because pluto orbits in a belt of
material it doesn't satisfy

272
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:19,519
material it doesn't satisfy
 

273
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,230
material it doesn't satisfy
that stipulation why didn't it clear out

274
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:22,240
that stipulation why didn't it clear out
 

275
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,590
that stipulation why didn't it clear out
the path it's not big enough

276
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:23,600
the path it's not big enough
 

277
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,310
the path it's not big enough
right knock everybody out of the way um

278
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:26,320
right knock everybody out of the way um
 

279
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,070
right knock everybody out of the way um
and this actually is not the first time

280
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:28,080
and this actually is not the first time
 

281
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,270
and this actually is not the first time
it has happened so

282
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:29,280
it has happened so
 

283
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,270
it has happened so
series when it was discovered ceres is

284
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:31,280
series when it was discovered ceres is
 

285
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,629
series when it was discovered ceres is
the largest asteroid in the asteroid

286
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:32,639
the largest asteroid in the asteroid
 

287
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,189
the largest asteroid in the asteroid
belt

288
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:33,199
belt
 

289
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,710
belt
and it was originally considered a

290
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:34,720
and it was originally considered a
 

291
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,710
and it was originally considered a
planet when it was first discovered and

292
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:36,720
planet when it was first discovered and
 

293
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,510
planet when it was first discovered and
it went through

294
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:37,520
it went through
 

295
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,189
it went through
exactly the same story history where

296
00:04:41,189 --> 00:04:41,199
exactly the same story history where
 

297
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,110
exactly the same story history where
people actually realized that it was

298
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:43,120
people actually realized that it was
 

299
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,710
people actually realized that it was
just one of many asteroids in the

300
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:44,720
just one of many asteroids in the
 

301
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,469
just one of many asteroids in the
asteroid belt region and then it got

302
00:04:46,469 --> 00:04:46,479
asteroid belt region and then it got
 

303
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,310
asteroid belt region and then it got
declassified to an asteroid and now it's

304
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:48,320
declassified to an asteroid and now it's
 

305
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,990
declassified to an asteroid and now it's
back to a dwarf planet

306
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:50,000
back to a dwarf planet
 

307
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,310
back to a dwarf planet
so there is a lot of reclassification so

308
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:52,320
so there is a lot of reclassification so
 

309
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,469
so there is a lot of reclassification so
to me as somebody who studies

310
00:04:54,469 --> 00:04:54,479
to me as somebody who studies
 

311
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,909
to me as somebody who studies
solar system objects i

312
00:04:57,909 --> 00:04:57,919
solar system objects i
 

313
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,390
solar system objects i
just personally don't care my level of

314
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:00,400
just personally don't care my level of
 

315
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,070
just personally don't care my level of
interest and something has nothing to do

316
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:02,080
interest and something has nothing to do
 

317
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:02,469
interest and something has nothing to do
with

318
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:02,479
with
 

319
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,189
with
what it's classified as so my favorite

320
00:05:05,189 --> 00:05:05,199
what it's classified as so my favorite
 

321
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,469
what it's classified as so my favorite
objects in the solar system are all

322
00:05:06,469 --> 00:05:06,479
objects in the solar system are all
 

323
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,150
objects in the solar system are all
moons and frequently when i

324
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:08,160
moons and frequently when i
 

325
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,590
moons and frequently when i
talk about them i refer to them as

326
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:09,600
talk about them i refer to them as
 

327
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,749
talk about them i refer to them as
planets because to me they are

328
00:05:11,749 --> 00:05:11,759
planets because to me they are
 

329
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,590
planets because to me they are
planets they have volcanoes they have

330
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:13,600
planets they have volcanoes they have
 

331
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,430
planets they have volcanoes they have
geology they have atmospheres they're

332
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:15,440
geology they have atmospheres they're
 

333
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,390
geology they have atmospheres they're

planet-like
worlds and so the distinction is not

336
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:18,800
worlds and so the distinction is not
 

337
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,990
worlds and so the distinction is not
super meaningful to me

338
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:20,000
super meaningful to me
 

339
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,870
super meaningful to me
but i it is important just for having a

but i it is important just for having a
 

341
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,990
but i it is important just for having a

general framework
 

343
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,790
general framework
for for understanding and talking about

for for understanding and talking about
 

345
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,550
for for understanding and talking about
things to have a precise definition

things to have a precise definition
 

347

things to have a precise definition
so you don't have a special romantic

348
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:30,880
so you don't have a special romantic
 

349

we've spent a lot of time sending

we've spent a lot of time sending
spacecraft missions to planets we had a

i think that exploration of the moons in

00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:30,560
i think that exploration of the moons in
 

411
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,070
i think that exploration of the moons in
the outer solar system is

412
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:32,080
the outer solar system is
 

413
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,830
the outer solar system is
the next frontier of solar system

414
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:33,840
the next frontier of solar system

the belt of debris just real quick

418
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:37,680
the belt of debris just real quick
 

419
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,189
the belt of debris just real quick
that's out there

420
00:06:39,189 --> 00:06:39,199
that's out there
 

421
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,550
that's out there
is there something incredible to be

422
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:40,560
is there something incredible to be
 

423
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,550
is there something incredible to be
discovered there

424
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:42,560
discovered there
 

425
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,550

again we tend to focus on the planets

426
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:44,560
again we tend to focus on the planets
 

427
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,950
again we tend to focus on the planets
and the moons but it feels like

428
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:46,960
and the moons but it feels like
 

429
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,309
and the moons but it feels like
there's probably a lot of stuff out

430
00:06:48,309 --> 00:06:48,319
there's probably a lot of stuff out
 

431
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,870
there's probably a lot of stuff out
there and it probably

432
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:50,880
there and it probably
 

433
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,110
there and it probably
what is it it's like a garbage collector

434
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:53,120
what is it it's like a garbage collector
 

435
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,390
what is it it's like a garbage collector
from

436
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:54,400
from
 

437
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,629
from
outside of the solar system isn't it

438
00:06:56,629 --> 00:06:56,639
outside of the solar system isn't it
 

439
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,230
outside of the solar system isn't it
like doesn't it protect

440
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:58,240
like doesn't it protect
 

441
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,990
like doesn't it protect
from other objects that kind of fly in

442
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:00,000
from other objects that kind of fly in
 

443
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,390
from other objects that kind of fly in
and what it just feels like

444
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:02,400
and what it just feels like
 

445
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,830
and what it just feels like
it's a cool you know you know when you

446
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:05,840
it's a cool you know you know when you
 

447
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,350
it's a cool you know you know when you
like walk along the beach and look for

448
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:07,360
like walk along the beach and look for
 

449
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,150
like walk along the beach and look for
stuff

stuff
 

451
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,589
stuff
and like look for sure it feels like

452
00:07:09,589 --> 00:07:09,599
and like look for sure it feels like
 

453
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,430
and like look for sure it feels like
that's that kind of place where you can

454
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:11,440
that's that kind of place where you can
 

455
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,230
that's that kind of place where you can
find cool

456
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:12,240
find cool
 

457
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,510
find cool
cool weird things or it i guess

458
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:15,520
cool weird things or it i guess
 

459
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,189
cool weird things or it i guess
in our conversation today when we think

460
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:17,199
in our conversation today when we think
 

461
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,510
in our conversation today when we think
about tools and what science is

462
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:19,520
about tools and what science is
 

463
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,350
about tools and what science is
studying is there something to be

464
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:21,360
studying is there something to be
 

465
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,029
studying is there something to be
studied out there or we just don't have

466
00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:23,039
studied out there or we just don't have
 

467
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,870
studied out there or we just don't have
maybe the tools yet or there's nothing

468
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:24,880
maybe the tools yet or there's nothing
 

469
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,150
maybe the tools yet or there's nothing
to be found

470
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:26,160
to be found
 

471
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,909
to be found
there's there's absolutely a lot to be

472
00:07:27,909 --> 00:07:27,919
there's there's absolutely a lot to be
 

473
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,270
there's there's absolutely a lot to be
found so the material that's out there

474
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:29,280
found so the material that's out there
 

475
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:29,990
found so the material that's out there
is remnant

476
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:30,000
is remnant
 

477
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,749
is remnant
material from the formation of our solar

478
00:07:31,749 --> 00:07:31,759
material from the formation of our solar
 

479
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,749
material from the formation of our solar
system it's we don't think it comes from

480
00:07:33,749 --> 00:07:33,759
system it's we don't think it comes from
 

481
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,510
system it's we don't think it comes from
outside the solar system at least not

482
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:35,520
outside the solar system at least not
 

483
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,309
outside the solar system at least not
most of it

484
00:07:38,309 --> 00:07:38,319

 

485
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,350

but there are so many

486
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:41,360
but there are so many
 

487
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,270
but there are so many
fascinating objects out there and i i

think what you fit on is exactly right

490
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:44,960
think what you fit on is exactly right
 

491
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,790
think what you fit on is exactly right
that we just don't have the tools to

492
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:46,800
that we just don't have the tools to
 

493
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,550
that we just don't have the tools to
study them in detail

494
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:48,560
study them in detail
 

495
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,390
study them in detail
but we we can look out there and we can

496
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:50,400
but we we can look out there and we can
 

497
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,469
but we we can look out there and we can
see there are different species of ice

00:07:52,469 --> 00:07:52,479
see there are different species of ice
 

499
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,469
see there are different species of ice
on their surface that tells us about

500
00:07:54,469 --> 00:07:54,479
on their surface that tells us about
 

501
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,029
on their surface that tells us about
you know the chemical composition of the

502
00:07:57,029 --> 00:07:57,039
you know the chemical composition of the
 

503
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,790
you know the chemical composition of the
disc that formed our solar system

some of these objects are way brighter

506
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:00,560
some of these objects are way brighter
 

507
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,629
some of these objects are way brighter
than they should be meaning they have

00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:02,639
than they should be meaning they have
 

509
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,309
than they should be meaning they have
some kind of geological activity people

510
00:08:04,309 --> 00:08:04,319
some kind of geological activity people
 

511
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,830
some kind of geological activity people
have hypothesized that some of these

512
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:05,840
have hypothesized that some of these
 

513
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,830
have hypothesized that some of these
objects have subsurface oceans

514
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:07,840
objects have subsurface oceans
 

515
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,510
objects have subsurface oceans
you could even stretch your imagination

516
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:09,520
you could even stretch your imagination
 

517
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,869
you could even stretch your imagination
and say some of those oceans could be

518
00:08:10,869 --> 00:08:10,879
and say some of those oceans could be
 

519
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,230
and say some of those oceans could be
habitable

520
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:12,240
habitable
 

521
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,950
habitable
but we can't get very detailed

522
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:14,960
but we can't get very detailed
 

523
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,150
but we can't get very detailed
information about them because they're

524
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:16,160
information about them because they're
 

525
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,070
information about them because they're
so far away and so i think

526
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:18,080
so far away and so i think
 

527
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,510
so far away and so i think
if any of those objects were in the

528
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:19,520
if any of those objects were in the
 

529
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,510
if any of those objects were in the
inner solar system it would be studied

530
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:21,520
inner solar system it would be studied
 

531
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,830
inner solar system it would be studied
intently and would be very interesting

532
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:23,840
intently and would be very interesting
 

533
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,710
intently and would be very interesting
so would you be able to design a probe

534
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:26,720
so would you be able to design a probe
 

535
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,749
so would you be able to design a probe
in that like very dense debris field

536
00:08:29,749 --> 00:08:29,759
in that like very dense debris field
 

537
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,350
in that like very dense debris field
be able to like hop from one place to

538
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:31,360
be able to like hop from one place to
 

539
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,149
be able to like hop from one place to
another is that just outside the

540
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:34,159
another is that just outside the
 

541
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,630
another is that just outside the
realm of like how would you even design

542
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:36,640
realm of like how would you even design
 

543
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,110
realm of like how would you even design
devices or sensors that go out there

544
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:39,120
devices or sensors that go out there
 

545
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,310
devices or sensors that go out there
and take pictures and and land do you

546
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:42,320
and take pictures and and land do you
 

547
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,470
and take pictures and and land do you
have to land to truly understand

548
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:44,480
have to land to truly understand
 

549
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,710
have to land to truly understand
a little piece of rock or can you

550
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:46,720
a little piece of rock or can you
 

551
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,590
a little piece of rock or can you
understand it from

552
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:47,600
understand it from
 

553
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,630
understand it from
remotely like fly up close and remotely

554
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:50,640
remotely like fly up close and remotely
 

555
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,389

00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:54,560
you can learn quite a lot from just a
 

559
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,230
you can learn quite a lot from just a
flyby and that's all we're currently

560
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:56,240
flyby and that's all we're currently
 

561
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,670
flyby and that's all we're currently
capable of doing in the outer solar

562
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:57,680
capable of doing in the outer solar

um the new horizons mission is a recent

566
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:01,360
um the new horizons mission is a recent
 

567
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,990
um the new horizons mission is a recent
example which flew by pluto and then

568
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:04,000
example which flew by pluto and then
 

569
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,389
example which flew by pluto and then
they had searched for another object

570
00:09:06,389 --> 00:09:06,399
they had searched for another object
 

571
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:07,829
they had searched for another object
that was out there in the kuiper belt

572
00:09:07,829 --> 00:09:07,839
that was out there in the kuiper belt
 

573
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,990
that was out there in the kuiper belt
any object that was basically

574
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:10,000
any object that was basically
 

575
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,070
any object that was basically
somewhere that they could deflect their

576
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:12,080
somewhere that they could deflect their
 

577
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,990
somewhere that they could deflect their
trajectory to actually fly by and so

578
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:14,000
trajectory to actually fly by and so
 

579
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,269
trajectory to actually fly by and so
they did fly by

580
00:09:15,269 --> 00:09:15,279
they did fly by
 

581
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,870
they did fly by
another object out there in the kuiper

582
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:16,880
another object out there in the kuiper
 

583
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,870
another object out there in the kuiper
belt and they take pictures and they do

584
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:18,880
belt and they take pictures and they do
 

585
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,630
belt and they take pictures and they do
what they can do and if you've seen the

586
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:20,640
what they can do and if you've seen the
 

587
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,509
what they can do and if you've seen the
images from

588
00:09:21,509 --> 00:09:21,519
images from
 

589
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,310
images from
that mission of pluto you can see just

590
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:24,320
that mission of pluto you can see just
 

591
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,470
that mission of pluto you can see just
how much detail we have compared to just

592
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:26,480
how much detail we have compared to just
 

593
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,389
how much detail we have compared to just
the sort of reddish dot that we knew of

594
00:09:28,389 --> 00:09:28,399
the sort of reddish dot that we knew of
 

595
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:29,430
the sort of reddish dot that we knew of
before

596
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:29,440
before
 

597
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,590
before
so you do get an amazing amount of

598
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:31,600
so you do get an amazing amount of
 

599
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,030
so you do get an amazing amount of
information actually from just

600
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:33,040
information actually from just
 

601
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,509
information actually from just
essentially a high speed flyby it always

602
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:35,519
essentially a high speed flyby it always
 

603
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:36,150
essentially a high speed flyby it always
makes me

604
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:36,160
makes me
 

605
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,630
makes me
sad to think about flybys that we might

606
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:38,640
sad to think about flybys that we might
 

607
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,509
sad to think about flybys that we might
be able to

608
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:39,519
be able to
 

609
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,389
be able to
we might fly by a piece of rock take a

610
00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:42,399
we might fly by a piece of rock take a
 

611
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,829
we might fly by a piece of rock take a
picture

612
00:09:43,829 --> 00:09:43,839
picture
 

613
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,509
picture
and think oh that looks pretty and cool

614
00:09:45,509 --> 00:09:45,519
and think oh that looks pretty and cool
 

615
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:46,870
and think oh that looks pretty and cool
whatever and that you could study

616
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:46,880
whatever and that you could study
 

617
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,710
whatever and that you could study
certain like composition of the surface

618
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:48,720
certain like composition of the surface
 

619
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,790
certain like composition of the surface
and so on but it's actually

620
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:50,800
and so on but it's actually
 

621
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,110
and so on but it's actually
teeming with life and we won't be able

622
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:53,120
teeming with life and we won't be able
 

623
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,230
teeming with life and we won't be able
to see it

624
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:54,240
to see it
 

625
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,269
to see it
at first it's sad because

626
00:09:57,269 --> 00:09:57,279
at first it's sad because
 

627
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,550
at first it's sad because
you know like when you're on a deserted

628
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:58,560
you know like when you're on a deserted
 

629
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,310
you know like when you're on a deserted
island you wave your hands and the thing

630
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:00,320
island you wave your hands and the thing
 

631
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,590
island you wave your hands and the thing
flies by and you're

632
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:01,600
flies by and you're
 

633
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,590
flies by and you're
trying to get their attention and they

634
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:03,600
trying to get their attention and they
 

635
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,630
trying to get their attention and they
probably do the same

636
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:04,640
probably do the same
 

637
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,430
probably do the same
well in their own way bacteria probably

638
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:07,440
well in their own way bacteria probably
 

639
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,470
well in their own way bacteria probably
right but

640
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:08,480
right but
 

641
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,509
right but
and we we miss it i don't know some

642
00:10:11,509 --> 00:10:11,519
and we we miss it i don't know some
 

643
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:12,710
and we we miss it i don't know some
reason it makes me it's a

644
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:12,720
reason it makes me it's a
 

645
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,150
reason it makes me it's a
it's the fomo it's fear of missing out

646
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:16,160
it's the fomo it's fear of missing out
 

647
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,150
it's the fomo it's fear of missing out
it makes me sad that there might be life

648
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:18,160
it makes me sad that there might be life
 

649
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,990
it makes me sad that there might be life
out there

650
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:20,000
out there
 

651
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,269
out there
and we don't we're not in touch with it

652
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:23,279
and we don't we're not in touch with it
 

653
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,550
and we don't we're not in touch with it
we're not talking yeah well

654
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:26,560
we're not talking yeah well
 

655
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,150
we're not talking yeah well
okay uh a sad uh

656
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:30,160
okay uh a sad uh

00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,389
okay uh a sad uh
pause uh russian philosophical pause

00:10:32,389 --> 00:10:32,399
pause uh russian philosophical pause
 

659
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,550

okay what are the tools available to us

660
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:34,560
okay what are the tools available to us
 

661
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,670
okay what are the tools available to us
to study planets and their moons

662
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:37,680
to study planets and their moons
 

663
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,509
to study planets and their moons
oh my goodness that is such a big

664
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:39,519
oh my goodness that is such a big
 

665
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,350
oh my goodness that is such a big
question um

666
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:41,360
question um
 

667
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,310
question um
so among the fields of astronomy so

668
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:44,320
so among the fields of astronomy so
 

669
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,389
so among the fields of astronomy so
planetary science broadly speaking

670
00:10:46,389 --> 00:10:46,399
planetary science broadly speaking
 

671
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,870
planetary science broadly speaking
well it falls kind of at the border of

672
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:48,880
well it falls kind of at the border of
 

673
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,230
well it falls kind of at the border of
astronomy

674
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:50,240
astronomy
 

675
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,949
astronomy
geology climate science chemistry and

676
00:10:52,949 --> 00:10:52,959
geology climate science chemistry and
 

677
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,310
geology climate science chemistry and
even biology so it's kind of on the

678
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:54,320
even biology so it's kind of on the
 

679
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,389
even biology so it's kind of on the
border of many things but

680
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:56,399
border of many things but
 

681
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:57,829
border of many things but
part of it falls under the heading of

00:10:57,829 --> 00:10:57,839
part of it falls under the heading of
 

683
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,430
part of it falls under the heading of
astronomy and among the things that you

684
00:10:59,430 --> 00:10:59,440
astronomy and among the things that you
 

685
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,389
astronomy and among the things that you
can study

686
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:00,399
can study
 

687
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,389
can study
with telescopes like solar system moons

688
00:11:02,389 --> 00:11:02,399
with telescopes like solar system moons
 

689
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,310
with telescopes like solar system moons
um and planets

690
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:04,320
um and planets
 

691
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,069
um and planets
the solar system is really unique in

692
00:11:06,069 --> 00:11:06,079
the solar system is really unique in
 

693
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,389
the solar system is really unique in
that we can actually send

694
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:08,399
that we can actually send
 

695
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,310
that we can actually send
spacecraft missions to the objects and

696
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:10,320
spacecraft missions to the objects and
 

697
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,990
spacecraft missions to the objects and
study them in detail and so i think

698
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:12,000
study them in detail and so i think
 

699
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,150
study them in detail and so i think
that's that's the kind of type of tool

700
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:14,160
that's that's the kind of type of tool
 

701
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,990
that's that's the kind of type of tool
that is that people are most aware of

702
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:16,000
that is that people are most aware of
 

703
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,269
that is that people are most aware of
this most popular eyes

704
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:17,279
this most popular eyes
 

705
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,870
this most popular eyes
these amazing nasa missions that either

706
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:20,880
these amazing nasa missions that either
 

707
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,949
these amazing nasa missions that either
you fly by the object you orbit the

708
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:22,959
you fly by the object you orbit the
 

709
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,550
you fly by the object you orbit the
object you land on the object

710
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:24,560
object you land on the object
 

711
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,389
object you land on the object
potentially you can

712
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:26,399
potentially you can
 

713
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,230
potentially you can
talk about digging into it drilling um

714
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:30,240
talk about digging into it drilling um
 

715
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,110
talk about digging into it drilling um
trying to detect tectonic tremors on its

716
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:33,120
trying to detect tectonic tremors on its
 

717
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:33,829
trying to detect tectonic tremors on its
surface

718
00:11:33,829 --> 00:11:33,839
surface
 

719
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,870
surface
um the types of tools that i use

720
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:36,880
um the types of tools that i use
 

721
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,750
um the types of tools that i use
are primarily telescopes and so i my

722
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:39,760
are primarily telescopes and so i my
 

723
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,350
are primarily telescopes and so i my
background is in

724
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:41,360
background is in
 

725
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,350
background is in
astrophysics and so i actually got into

726
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:43,360
astrophysics and so i actually got into
 

727
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,190
astrophysics and so i actually got into
solar system science from

728
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:45,200
solar system science from
 

729
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,670
solar system science from
astronomy not from you know a childhood

730
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:47,680
astronomy not from you know a childhood
 

731
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,190
astronomy not from you know a childhood
fascination with spacecraft missions

732
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:49,200
fascination with spacecraft missions
 

733
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,710
fascination with spacecraft missions
which is actually what

734
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:50,720
which is actually what
 

735
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,629
which is actually what
a lot of planetary scientists became

736
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:52,639
a lot of planetary scientists became
 

737
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,069
a lot of planetary scientists became
planetary scientists because of

738
00:11:54,069 --> 00:11:54,079
planetary scientists because of
 

739
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,750
planetary scientists because of
childhood fascination with spacecraft

740
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:55,760
childhood fascination with spacecraft
 

741
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,910
childhood fascination with spacecraft
missions which is kind of interesting

742
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:57,920
missions which is kind of interesting
 

743
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,829
missions which is kind of interesting
for me to talk to people and see that

744
00:11:59,829 --> 00:11:59,839
for me to talk to people and see that
 

745
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,670
for me to talk to people and see that
trajectory i kind of came at it from the

746
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:01,680
trajectory i kind of came at it from the
 

747
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,590
trajectory i kind of came at it from the
fascination with telescope's angle

748
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:03,600
fascination with telescope's angle
 

749
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,590
fascination with telescope's angle
do you like telescopes not rockets or at

750
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:05,600
do you like telescopes not rockets or at
 

751
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,110
do you like telescopes not rockets or at
least when i was a

752
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:07,120
least when i was a
 

753
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,670
least when i was a
kid it was looking at the stars and

754
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:09,680
kid it was looking at the stars and
 

755
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,949
kid it was looking at the stars and
playing with telescopes that really

756
00:12:10,949 --> 00:12:10,959
playing with telescopes that really
 

757
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,550
playing with telescopes that really
fascinated me and that's how i got into

758
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:12,560
fascinated me and that's how i got into
 

759
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,910
fascinated me and that's how i got into
this

760
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:13,920
this
 

761
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,110
this
but telescopes it's

762
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:17,120
but telescopes it's
 

763
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,350
but telescopes it's
amazing how much detail and how much

764
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:19,360
amazing how much detail and how much
 

765
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,190
amazing how much detail and how much
information you can get from

766
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:21,200
information you can get from
 

767
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,269
information you can get from
telescopes today you can resolve

768
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:25,279
telescopes today you can resolve
 

769
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,829
telescopes today you can resolve
individual cloud features and watch them

770
00:12:27,829 --> 00:12:27,839
individual cloud features and watch them
 

771
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,150
individual cloud features and watch them
kind of sheer out in the atmosphere of

772
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:30,160
kind of sheer out in the atmosphere of
 

773
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,509
kind of sheer out in the atmosphere of
titan you can

774
00:12:31,509 --> 00:12:31,519
titan you can
 

775
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,470
titan you can
literally watch volcanoes on io change

776
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:34,480
literally watch volcanoes on io change
 

777
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,550
literally watch volcanoes on io change
from day to day as the the lava flows

778
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:36,560
from day to day as the the lava flows
 

779
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,470
from day to day as the the lava flows
expand

780
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:38,480
expand
 

781
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,269
expand
so and then you know with spectroscopy

782
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:41,279
so and then you know with spectroscopy
 

783
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,949
so and then you know with spectroscopy
you get compositional information on all

784
00:12:42,949 --> 00:12:42,959
you get compositional information on all
 

785
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:43,910
you get compositional information on all
these things and

786
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:43,920
these things and
 

787
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,069
these things and
it's when i started doing solar system

788
00:12:48,069 --> 00:12:48,079
it's when i started doing solar system
 

789
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:49,430
it's when i started doing solar system
astronomy i was

790
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:49,440
astronomy i was
 

791
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,350
astronomy i was
surprised by how much detail and how

792
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:51,360
surprised by how much detail and how
 

793
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,870
surprised by how much detail and how
much information you can get

794
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:52,880
much information you can get
 

795
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,350
much information you can get
even from earth and then as well as from

796
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:55,360
even from earth and then as well as from
 

797
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,110
even from earth and then as well as from
orbit like the hubble space telescope or

798
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:57,120
orbit like the hubble space telescope or
 

799
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,430
orbit like the hubble space telescope or
the james webb

800
00:12:59,430 --> 00:12:59,440
the james webb
 

801
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,949
the james webb
so with the telescope you can

802
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:02,959
so with the telescope you can
 

803
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,190
so with the telescope you can
i mean how much information can you get

804
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:05,200
i mean how much information can you get
 

805
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,870
i mean how much information can you get
about volcanoes about

806
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:06,880
about volcanoes about
 

807
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,910
about volcanoes about
storms about sort of weather

808
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:09,920
storms about sort of weather
 

809
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,030
storms about sort of weather
just so we kind of get a sense like what

810
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:13,040
just so we kind of get a sense like what
 

811
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,269
just so we kind of get a sense like what
a resolution we're talking about

812
00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:15,279
a resolution we're talking about
 

813
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:18,230
a resolution we're talking about
well in terms of resolution so at a you

814
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:18,240
well in terms of resolution so at a you
 

815
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,990
well in terms of resolution so at a you
know on a given night if i go and take a

816
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:20,000
know on a given night if i go and take a
 

817
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,990
know on a given night if i go and take a
picture of io and it's volcanoes you can

818
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:22,000
picture of io and it's volcanoes you can
 

819
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,310
picture of io and it's volcanoes you can
sometimes see

820
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:24,320
sometimes see
 

821
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,389
sometimes see
at least a dozen different volcanoes you

822
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:26,399
at least a dozen different volcanoes you
 

823
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,990
at least a dozen different volcanoes you
can see the infrared emission coming off

824
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:28,000
can see the infrared emission coming off
 

825
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,710
can see the infrared emission coming off
of them and

826
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:28,720
of them and
 

827
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,389
of them and
resolve them separate them from one

828
00:13:30,389 --> 00:13:30,399
resolve them separate them from one
 

829
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,710
resolve them separate them from one
another on the surface

830
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:32,720
another on the surface
 

831
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,629
another on the surface
and and actually watch how how the heat

832
00:13:34,629 --> 00:13:34,639
and and actually watch how how the heat
 

833
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,350
and and actually watch how how the heat
coming off of them changes with time

834
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:37,360
coming off of them changes with time
 

835
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,269
coming off of them changes with time
and i think this time variability aspect

836
00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:39,279
and i think this time variability aspect
 

837
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:40,949
and i think this time variability aspect
is one of the big advantages we get from

838
00:13:40,949 --> 00:13:40,959
is one of the big advantages we get from
 

839
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,629
is one of the big advantages we get from
telescopes so you send a spacecraft

840
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:42,639
telescopes so you send a spacecraft
 

841
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:43,670
telescopes so you send a spacecraft
mission there

842
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:43,680
mission there
 

843
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,350
mission there
and you get an incredible amount of

844
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:45,360
and you get an incredible amount of
 

845
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,949
and you get an incredible amount of
information over a very short time

846
00:13:46,949 --> 00:13:46,959
information over a very short time
 

847
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:47,990
information over a very short time
period but for some

848
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:48,000
period but for some
 

849
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,230
period but for some
science questions you need to observe

850
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:50,240
science questions you need to observe
 

851
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,910
science questions you need to observe
something for

852
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:51,920
something for
 

853
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,550
something for
30 years 40 years like let's say you

854
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:54,560
30 years 40 years like let's say you
 

855
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,670
30 years 40 years like let's say you
want to look at the moon

856
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:55,680
want to look at the moon
 

857
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,030
want to look at the moon
titan which has one of the most

858
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:57,040
titan which has one of the most
 

859
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,030
titan which has one of the most
interesting atmospheres in the solar

860
00:13:59,030 --> 00:13:59,040
interesting atmospheres in the solar
 

861
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,310
interesting atmospheres in the solar
system

862
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:00,320
system
 

863
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,670
system
it's orbital period is 29

864
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:03,680
it's orbital period is 29
 

865
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,910
it's orbital period is 29
30 years and so if you want to look at

866
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:05,920
30 years and so if you want to look at
 

867
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,030
30 years and so if you want to look at
how

868
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:07,040
how
 

869
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,030
how
its atmospheric seasons work you have to

870
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:09,040
its atmospheric seasons work you have to
 

871
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,629
its atmospheric seasons work you have to
observe it over that long of a time

872
00:14:10,629 --> 00:14:10,639
observe it over that long of a time
 

873
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:11,990
observe it over that long of a time
period and you're not going to do that

874
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:12,000
period and you're not going to do that
 

875
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,110
period and you're not going to do that
with a spacecraft

876
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:13,120
with a spacecraft
 

877
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,590
with a spacecraft
but you can do it with telescopes can we

878
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:15,600
but you can do it with telescopes can we
 

879
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,310
but you can do it with telescopes can we
uh just

880
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:16,320
uh just
 

881
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,069
uh just
zoom in on certain things like let's

882
00:14:18,069 --> 00:14:18,079
zoom in on certain things like let's
 

883
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,230
zoom in on certain things like let's
talk about io which is the moon of

884
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:20,240
talk about io which is the moon of
 

885
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,750
talk about io which is the moon of
uh jupiter right okay it's like epic

886
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:23,760
uh jupiter right okay it's like epic
 

887
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,829
uh jupiter right okay it's like epic
there's like volcanoes all over the

888
00:14:25,829 --> 00:14:25,839
there's like volcanoes all over the
 

889
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:27,110
there's like volcanoes all over the
place

890
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:27,120
place
 

891
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,870
place
it's um from a distance it's awesome

892
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:30,880
it's um from a distance it's awesome
 

893
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,509
it's um from a distance it's awesome
so can you tell me about this moon and

894
00:14:33,509 --> 00:14:33,519
so can you tell me about this moon and
 

895
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:33,990
so can you tell me about this moon and
you're

896
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:34,000
you're
 

897
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,030
you're
sort of uh a scholar of many planets and

898
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:37,040
sort of uh a scholar of many planets and
 

899
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:37,509
sort of uh a scholar of many planets and
moons

900
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:37,519
moons
 

901
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,150
moons
but that one kind of stood out to me so

902
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:40,160
but that one kind of stood out to me so
 

903
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,230
but that one kind of stood out to me so
why is that an interesting one

904
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:42,240
why is that an interesting one
 

905
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,189
why is that an interesting one
for so many reasons but uh io is it is

906
00:14:45,189 --> 00:14:45,199
for so many reasons but uh io is it is
 

907
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:46,870
for so many reasons but uh io is it is
the most volcanically active object in

908
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:46,880
the most volcanically active object in
 

909
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,389
the most volcanically active object in
the solar system it has hundreds of

910
00:14:48,389 --> 00:14:48,399
the solar system it has hundreds of
 

911
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:49,990
the solar system it has hundreds of
active volcanoes on it

912
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:50,000
active volcanoes on it
 

913
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,350
active volcanoes on it
um it has volcanic plumes that go

914
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:53,360
um it has volcanic plumes that go
 

915
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,110
um it has volcanic plumes that go
hundreds of kilometers up above its

916
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:55,120
hundreds of kilometers up above its
 

917
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,949
hundreds of kilometers up above its
surface it puts out

918
00:14:56,949 --> 00:14:56,959
surface it puts out
 

919
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:00,710
surface it puts out
more volume of magma per volcano than

920
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:00,720
more volume of magma per volcano than
 

921
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,150
more volume of magma per volcano than
volcanoes on earth today um but

922
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:04,160
volcanoes on earth today um but
 

923
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,710
volcanoes on earth today um but
i think to me the reason that it's most

924
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:06,720
i think to me the reason that it's most
 

925
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,910
i think to me the reason that it's most
interesting is be

926
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:07,920
interesting is be
 

927
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,230
interesting is be
is as a laboratory for understanding

928
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:10,240
is as a laboratory for understanding
 

929
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,629
is as a laboratory for understanding
planetary processes

930
00:15:12,629 --> 00:15:12,639
planetary processes
 

931
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,269
planetary processes
so one of the broad goals of planetary

932
00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:15,279
so one of the broad goals of planetary
 

933
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,710
so one of the broad goals of planetary
science is to put together

934
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:16,720
science is to put together
 

935
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,710
science is to put together
a sort of more general and coherent

936
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:20,720
a sort of more general and coherent
 

937
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,910
a sort of more general and coherent
framework for how planets work in

938
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:23,920
framework for how planets work in

00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:26,160
our current framework you know it
 

943
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,910
our current framework you know it
started out very earth-centric we start

944
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:27,920
started out very earth-centric we start
 

945
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,150
started out very earth-centric we start
to understand how earth volcanoes work

946
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:30,160
to understand how earth volcanoes work
 

947
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,150
to understand how earth volcanoes work
um but then when you try to transport

948
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:32,160
um but then when you try to transport
 

949
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,910
um but then when you try to transport
that to somewhere like io that doesn't

950
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:33,920
that to somewhere like io that doesn't
 

951
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,389
that to somewhere like io that doesn't
have an atmosphere which makes it

952
00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:36,399
have an atmosphere which makes it
 

953
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:37,910
have an atmosphere which makes it
has a very tenuous atmosphere which

has a very tenuous atmosphere which
 

955
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,269
has a very tenuous atmosphere which
makes a big difference for how the the

the kind of intuition we have from earth

968
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:49,360
the kind of intuition we have from earth
 

969
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,829
the kind of intuition we have from earth
doesn't apply and so broadly

970
00:15:51,829 --> 00:15:51,839
doesn't apply and so broadly
 

971
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,949
doesn't apply and so broadly
planetary sciences is trying to broaden

972
00:15:54,949 --> 00:15:54,959
planetary sciences is trying to broaden
 

973
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:55,829
planetary sciences is trying to broaden
that framework

974
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:55,839
that framework
 

975
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,509
that framework
so that you have a kind of narrative

976
00:15:57,509 --> 00:15:57,519
so that you have a kind of narrative
 

977
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,509
so that you have a kind of narrative
that all you can understand how each

978
00:15:59,509 --> 00:15:59,519
that all you can understand how each
 

979
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,030
that all you can understand how each
planet became different from

980
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:01,040
planet became different from
 

981
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,269
planet became different from
every other planet and i'm already

982
00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:03,279
every other planet and i'm already
 

983
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,870
every other planet and i'm already
making a mistake when i say planet i

984
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:04,880
making a mistake when i say planet i
 

985
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,150
making a mistake when i say planet i
mean planets and moons

986
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:06,160
mean planets and moons
 

987
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,269
mean planets and moons
like i said i see the moons as planets

988
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:09,279
like i said i see the moons as planets
 

989
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,430
like i said i see the moons as planets
yeah i actually already noticed that you

990
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:11,440
yeah i actually already noticed that you
 

991
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,749
yeah i actually already noticed that you
didn't introduce io as the moon of

992
00:16:13,749 --> 00:16:13,759
didn't introduce io as the moon of
 

993
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:14,389
didn't introduce io as the moon of
jupiter

994
00:16:14,389 --> 00:16:14,399
jupiter
 

995
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,430
jupiter
you you completely you uh you kind of

996
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:17,440
you you completely you uh you kind of
 

997
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,269
you you completely you uh you kind of
ignored the fact that jupiter exists

998
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:19,279
ignored the fact that jupiter exists
 

999
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,710
ignored the fact that jupiter exists
it's like let's focus on this

1000
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:22,720
it's like let's focus on this
 

1001
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,110
it's like let's focus on this
yeah okay so uh and you also didn't

1002
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:25,120
yeah okay so uh and you also didn't
 

1003
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,389
yeah okay so uh and you also didn't
mention europa

1004
00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:26,399
mention europa
 

1005
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,069
mention europa
which i think is the is that the most

1006
00:16:28,069 --> 00:16:28,079
which i think is the is that the most
 

1007
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,949
which i think is the is that the most
famous moon of jupiter

1008
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:30,959
famous moon of jupiter
 

1009
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,389
famous moon of jupiter
it's like no one gets attention because

1010
00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:32,399
it's like no one gets attention because
 

1011
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:33,990
it's like no one gets attention because
it might have life exactly

1012
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:34,000
it might have life exactly
 

1013
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,710
it might have life exactly
yeah but you're but to you i o is also

1014
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:36,720
yeah but you're but to you i o is also
 

1015
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,430
yeah but you're but to you i o is also
beautiful

1016
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:37,440
beautiful
 

1017
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,870
beautiful
i what's the difference between

1018
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:38,880
i what's the difference between
 

1019
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,949
i what's the difference between
volcanoes on io

1020
00:16:40,949 --> 00:16:40,959
volcanoes on io
 

1021
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,269
volcanoes on io
versus earth you said atmosphere makes a

1022
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:43,279
versus earth you said atmosphere makes a
 

1023
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,710
versus earth you said atmosphere makes a
difference

1024
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:44,720
difference
 

1025
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,829
difference
what uh yeah um the heat source plays a

1026
00:16:47,829 --> 00:16:47,839
what uh yeah um the heat source plays a
 

1027
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,350
what uh yeah um the heat source plays a
big role so

1028
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:49,360
big role so
 

1029
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,749
big role so
um many of the moons in the outer solar

1030
00:16:51,749 --> 00:16:51,759
um many of the moons in the outer solar
 

1031
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:52,629
um many of the moons in the outer solar
system are heated

1032
00:16:52,629 --> 00:16:52,639
system are heated
 

1033
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,670
system are heated
from gravitationally by tidal heating um

1034
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:55,680
from gravitationally by tidal heating um
 

1035
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,150
from gravitationally by tidal heating um
and i'm

1036
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:56,160
and i'm
 

1037
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,629
and i'm
happy to describe what that is or well

1038
00:16:58,629 --> 00:16:58,639
happy to describe what that is or well
 

1039
00:16:58,639 --> 00:16:59,350
happy to describe what that is or well
yeah please

1040
00:16:59,350 --> 00:16:59,360
yeah please
 

1041
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,389
yeah please
okay um yes so tidal heating

1042
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:02,399
okay um yes so tidal heating
 

1043
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,909
okay um yes so tidal heating
is it's if you want to understand and

1044
00:17:05,909 --> 00:17:05,919
is it's if you want to understand and
 

1045
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:06,870
is it's if you want to understand and
contextualize

1046
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:06,880
contextualize
 

1047
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,309
contextualize
planets and moons you have to understand

1048
00:17:08,309 --> 00:17:08,319
planets and moons you have to understand
 

1049
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,909
planets and moons you have to understand
their heat sources

1050
00:17:09,909 --> 00:17:09,919
their heat sources
 

1051
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,789
their heat sources
um so for earth we have radioactive

1052
00:17:12,789 --> 00:17:12,799
um so for earth we have radioactive
 

1053
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,390
um so for earth we have radioactive
decay in our interior as well as

1054
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:14,400
decay in our interior as well as
 

1055
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,230
decay in our interior as well as
residual heat of formation

1056
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:16,240
residual heat of formation
 

1057
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,350
residual heat of formation
but for satellites tidal heating plays a

1058
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:19,360
but for satellites tidal heating plays a
 

1059
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,710
but for satellites tidal heating plays a
really significant role and in

1060
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:20,720
really significant role and in
 

1061
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,750
really significant role and in
particular in

1062
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:21,760
particular in
 

1063
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,350
particular in
driving geological activity on

1064
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:23,360
driving geological activity on
 

1065
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,949
driving geological activity on
satellites

1066
00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:24,959
satellites
 

1067
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,949
satellites
and potentially making those subsurface

1068
00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:26,959
and potentially making those subsurface
 

1069
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,350
and potentially making those subsurface
oceans in places like europa enceladus

1070
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:29,360
oceans in places like europa enceladus
 

1071
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,549
oceans in places like europa enceladus
habitable and so the way that that works

1072
00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:32,559
habitable and so the way that that works
 

1073
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,549
habitable and so the way that that works
is if you have multiple moons

1074
00:17:34,549 --> 00:17:34,559
is if you have multiple moons
 

1075
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,830
is if you have multiple moons
and their orbital periods are integer

1076
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:37,840
and their orbital periods are integer
 

1077
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,510
and their orbital periods are integer
multiples of one another

1078
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:39,520
multiples of one another
 

1079
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,350
multiples of one another
that means that they're always

1080
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:41,360
that means that they're always
 

1081
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,549
that means that they're always
encountering each other

1082
00:17:42,549 --> 00:17:42,559
encountering each other
 

1083
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:46,230
encountering each other
at the same point in the orbit

1084
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:46,240
at the same point in the orbit
 

1085
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,230
at the same point in the orbit
so if they were on just random orbits

1086
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:48,240
so if they were on just random orbits
 

1087
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,350
so if they were on just random orbits
they'd be encountering each other at

1088
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:49,360
they'd be encountering each other at
 

1089
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,190
they'd be encountering each other at
random places and the gravitational

1090
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:51,200
random places and the gravitational
 

1091
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,270
random places and the gravitational
effect between the two moons would be

1092
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:53,280
effect between the two moons would be
 

1093
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,350
effect between the two moons would be
canceling out over time but because

1094
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:55,360
canceling out over time but because
 

1095
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,950
canceling out over time but because
they're always meeting each other at the

1096
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:56,960
they're always meeting each other at the
 

1097
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,029
they're always meeting each other at the
same point in the orbit

1098
00:17:59,029 --> 00:17:59,039
same point in the orbit
 

1099
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,270
same point in the orbit
those gravitational interactions add up

1100
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:01,280
those gravitational interactions add up
 

1101
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,230
those gravitational interactions add up
coherently

1102
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:02,240
coherently
 

1103
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,789
coherently
um and so that tweaks them into

1104
00:18:04,789 --> 00:18:04,799
um and so that tweaks them into
 

1105
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,909
um and so that tweaks them into
eccentric orbits

1106
00:18:07,909 --> 00:18:07,919

 

1107
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,390

so eccentric orbit or elliptical orbit

1108
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:10,400
so eccentric orbit or elliptical orbit
 

1109
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,029
so eccentric orbit or elliptical orbit
it just means

1110
00:18:11,029 --> 00:18:11,039
it just means
 

1111
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,029
it just means
non-circular so a deviation from a

1112
00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:13,039
non-circular so a deviation from a
 

1113
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,870
non-circular so a deviation from a
circular orbit and that means that you

1114
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:14,880
circular orbit and that means that you
 

1115
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,710
circular orbit and that means that you
know for io or europa

1116
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:16,720
know for io or europa
 

1117
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,230
know for io or europa
it's some points in their orbit they're

1118
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:18,240
it's some points in their orbit they're
 

1119
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,070
it's some points in their orbit they're
closer to jupiter and at some points in

1120
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:20,080
closer to jupiter and at some points in
 

1121
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,150
closer to jupiter and at some points in
the orbit they're farther away

1122
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:22,160
the orbit they're farther away
 

1123
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,190
the orbit they're farther away
and so when they're closer they're

1124
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:25,200
and so when they're closer they're
 

1125
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,310
and so when they're closer they're
stretched out in a sense but but

1126
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:28,320
stretched out in a sense but but
 

1127
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,150
stretched out in a sense but but
literally just not very stretched out

1128
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:30,160
literally just not very stretched out
 

1129
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,430
literally just not very stretched out
like a couple hundred meters something

1130
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:31,440
like a couple hundred meters something
 

1131
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,070
like a couple hundred meters something
like that

1132
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:32,080
like that
 

1133
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,909
like that
and then when they're farthest away

1134
00:18:33,909 --> 00:18:33,919
and then when they're farthest away
 

1135
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,590
and then when they're farthest away
they're less stretched out and so you

1136
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:35,600
they're less stretched out and so you
 

1137
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,990
they're less stretched out and so you
actually have the shape of the object

1138
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:38,000
actually have the shape of the object
 

1139
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,990
actually have the shape of the object
deforming over the course of the orbit

1140
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:40,000
deforming over the course of the orbit
 

1141
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,430
deforming over the course of the orbit
and these orbits are like just a couple

1142
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:41,440
and these orbits are like just a couple
 

1143
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,390
and these orbits are like just a couple
of days

1144
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:42,400
of days
 

1145
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,029
of days
and so that in the case of io that is

1146
00:18:45,029 --> 00:18:45,039
and so that in the case of io that is
 

1147
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,150
and so that in the case of io that is
literally

1148
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:46,160
literally
 

1149
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,870
literally
sufficient friction in its mantle to

1150
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:48,880
sufficient friction in its mantle to
 

1151
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,710
sufficient friction in its mantle to
melt the rock of its mantle

1152
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:50,720
melt the rock of its mantle
 

1153
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,070
melt the rock of its mantle
and that's what generates the magma

1154
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:52,080
and that's what generates the magma
 

1155
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,830
and that's what generates the magma
that's that's the source of the

1156
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:53,840
that's that's the source of the
 

1157
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:58,150
that's that's the source of the
the okay so why is your so europa

1158
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:58,160
the okay so why is your so europa
 

1159
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,029
the okay so why is your so europa
is i thought there was like ice and

1160
00:19:01,029 --> 00:19:01,039
is i thought there was like ice and
 

1161
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,950
is i thought there was like ice and
oceans underneath kind of thing

1162
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:02,960
oceans underneath kind of thing
 

1163
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,310
oceans underneath kind of thing
so why is europe and not getting the

1164
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:04,320
so why is europe and not getting the
 

1165
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,390
so why is europe and not getting the
friction it is it's just a little bit

1166
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:06,400
friction it is it's just a little bit
 

1167
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,909
friction it is it's just a little bit
farther away from jupiter and then

1168
00:19:07,909 --> 00:19:07,919
farther away from jupiter and then
 

1169
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:09,029
farther away from jupiter and then
ganymede is also

1170
00:19:09,029 --> 00:19:09,039
ganymede is also
 

1171
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,590
ganymede is also
in the orbital resonance so it's a three

1172
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:11,600
in the orbital resonance so it's a three
 

1173
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,950
in the orbital resonance so it's a three
object orbital resonance

1174
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:12,960
object orbital resonance
 

1175
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,590
object orbital resonance
in the jupiter system but we have these

1176
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:15,600
in the jupiter system but we have these
 

1177
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,590
in the jupiter system but we have these
sorts of orbital resonances all over the

1178
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:17,600
sorts of orbital resonances all over the
 

1179
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,470
sorts of orbital resonances all over the
solar system and also in exoplanets

1180
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:20,480
solar system and also in exoplanets
 

1181
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,549
solar system and also in exoplanets
so for europa basically because it's

1182
00:19:22,549 --> 00:19:22,559
so for europa basically because it's
 

1183
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,710
so for europa basically because it's
farther from jupiter the effect is not

1184
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:24,720
farther from jupiter the effect is not
 

1185
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,270
farther from jupiter the effect is not
as extreme but you do still have heat

1186
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:27,280
as extreme but you do still have heat
 

1187
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,270
as extreme but you do still have heat
generated in its interior in this way

1188
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:29,280
generated in its interior in this way
 

1189
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,350
generated in its interior in this way
and that may be driving

1190
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:31,360
and that may be driving
 

1191
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,270
and that may be driving
could be driving hydrothermal activity

1192
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:33,280
could be driving hydrothermal activity
 

1193
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,710
could be driving hydrothermal activity
at the base of its ocean

1194
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:34,720
at the base of its ocean
 

1195
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,110
at the base of its ocean
which obviously would be a really

1196
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:37,120
which obviously would be a really
 

1197
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,549
which obviously would be a really
valuable thing for life

1198
00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:38,559
valuable thing for life
 

1199
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,789
valuable thing for life
cool so it's like heating up the ocean a

1200
00:19:40,789 --> 00:19:40,799
cool so it's like heating up the ocean a
 

1201
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:41,750
cool so it's like heating up the ocean a
little bit

1202
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:41,760
little bit
 

1203
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,830
little bit
heating up the ocean a little bit and

1204
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:43,840
heating up the ocean a little bit and
 

1205
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,830
heating up the ocean a little bit and
specifically in these like hydrothermal

1206
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:45,840
specifically in these like hydrothermal
 

1207
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,909
specifically in these like hydrothermal
vents where we see really interesting

1208
00:19:47,909 --> 00:19:47,919
vents where we see really interesting
 

1209
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,470
vents where we see really interesting
uh life evolve in the bottom of earth's

1210
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:50,480
uh life evolve in the bottom of earth's
 

1211
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,029
uh life evolve in the bottom of earth's
oceans

1212
00:19:51,029 --> 00:19:51,039
oceans
 

1213
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:54,470
oceans
that's cool okay so what's uh what's io

1214
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:54,480
that's cool okay so what's uh what's io
 

1215
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,470
that's cool okay so what's uh what's io
um what else so we know the source is

1216
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:56,480
um what else so we know the source is
 

1217
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,909
um what else so we know the source is
this friction

1218
00:19:57,909 --> 00:19:57,919
this friction
 

1219
00:19:57,919 --> 00:19:59,990
this friction
but there's no atmosphere i'm trying to

1220
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:00,000
but there's no atmosphere i'm trying to
 

1221
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,830
but there's no atmosphere i'm trying to
get a sense of what it's like if

1222
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:01,840
get a sense of what it's like if
 

1223
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,950
get a sense of what it's like if
if you and i were to visit io

1224
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:04,960
if you and i were to visit io
 

1225
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,470
if you and i were to visit io
like what would that look like what

1226
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:06,480
like what would that look like what
 

1227
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,630
like what would that look like what
would it feel like

1228
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:08,640
would it feel like
 

1229
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,789
would it feel like
is it is the entire thing covered in

1230
00:20:10,789 --> 00:20:10,799
is it is the entire thing covered in
 

1231
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,310
is it is the entire thing covered in
basically

1232
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:12,320
basically
 

1233
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,350
basically
uh volcanoes um

1234
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:15,360
uh volcanoes um
 

1235
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,430
uh volcanoes um
so it's it's interesting because there's

1236
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:17,440
so it's it's interesting because there's
 

1237
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,350
so it's it's interesting because there's
very little atmosphere the surface is

1238
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:19,360
very little atmosphere the surface is
 

1239
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,789
very little atmosphere the surface is
actually really cold

1240
00:20:20,789 --> 00:20:20,799
actually really cold
 

1241
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,870
actually really cold
very far below freezing on the surface

1242
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:22,880
very far below freezing on the surface
 

1243
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,470
very far below freezing on the surface
when you're away from a volcano but the

1244
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:24,480
when you're away from a volcano but the
 

1245
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,070
when you're away from a volcano but the
volcanoes themselves

1246
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:26,080
volcanoes themselves
 

1247
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,390
volcanoes themselves
are over a thousand degrees or the the

1248
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:28,400
are over a thousand degrees or the the
 

1249
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,750
are over a thousand degrees or the the
magma when it comes out is over a

1250
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:29,760
magma when it comes out is over a
 

1251
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,669
magma when it comes out is over a
thousand degrees and so

1252
00:20:31,669 --> 00:20:31,679
thousand degrees and so
 

1253
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,190
thousand degrees and so
but it does come to the surface the

1254
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:33,200
but it does come to the surface the
 

1255
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,510
but it does come to the surface the
magma it does yeah

1256
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:35,520
magma it does yeah
 

1257
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,149
magma it does yeah
in particular places oh that probably

1258
00:20:38,149 --> 00:20:38,159
in particular places oh that probably
 

1259
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:38,950
in particular places oh that probably
looks beautiful

1260
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:38,960
looks beautiful
 

1261
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,710
looks beautiful
so like so it's frozen not ice like what

1262
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:42,720
so like so it's frozen not ice like what
 

1263
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,029
so like so it's frozen not ice like what
is

1264
00:20:43,029 --> 00:20:43,039
is
 

1265
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:46,149
is
uh is rock it's really cold rock

1266
00:20:46,149 --> 00:20:46,159
uh is rock it's really cold rock
 

1267
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,350
uh is rock it's really cold rock
and then you just have this like uh

1268
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:49,360
and then you just have this like uh
 

1269
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,950
and then you just have this like uh
what is what does that look what would

1270
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:50,960
what is what does that look what would
 

1271
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,270
what is what does that look what would
that look like with no atmosphere

1272
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:53,280
that look like with no atmosphere
 

1273
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,870
that look like with no atmosphere
would that uh would it be smoke

1274
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:56,880
would that uh would it be smoke
 

1275
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,789
would that uh would it be smoke
what does it look like was it's just

1276
00:20:58,789 --> 00:20:58,799
what does it look like was it's just
 

1277
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,310
what does it look like was it's just
magma like just red

1278
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:00,320
magma like just red
 

1279
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,830
magma like just red
yellow like liquidy things uh it's

1280
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:03,840
yellow like liquidy things uh it's
 

1281
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,310
yellow like liquidy things uh it's
it's black it's black and red i guess

1282
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:06,320
it's black it's black and red i guess
 

1283
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,510
it's black it's black and red i guess
like think of

1284
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:07,520
like think of
 

1285
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,230
like think of
the type of magma that you see in hawaii

1286
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:10,240
the type of magma that you see in hawaii
 

1287
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,590
the type of magma that you see in hawaii
so different types of magma

1288
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:11,600
so different types of magma
 

1289
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,230
so different types of magma
flow in different ways for example so in

1290
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:14,240
flow in different ways for example so in
 

1291
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,149
flow in different ways for example so in
somewhere like io the magma is really

1292
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:16,159
somewhere like io the magma is really
 

1293
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,630
somewhere like io the magma is really
hot and so it will flow out in

1294
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:18,640
hot and so it will flow out in
 

1295
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,630
hot and so it will flow out in
sheets because it has really low

1296
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:20,640
sheets because it has really low
 

1297
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,990
sheets because it has really low
viscosity

1298
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:22,000
viscosity
 

1299
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,350
viscosity
um and i think the the lava flows that

1300
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:25,360
um and i think the the lava flows that
 

1301
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,070
um and i think the the lava flows that
we've been having

1302
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:26,080
we've been having
 

1303
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,669
we've been having
in hawaii over the past couple years are

1304
00:21:27,669 --> 00:21:27,679
in hawaii over the past couple years are
 

1305
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,710
in hawaii over the past couple years are
probably a decent analogy although um

1306
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:30,720
probably a decent analogy although um
 

1307
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,070
probably a decent analogy although um
ios magmas lavas are even more fluid and

1308
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:34,080
ios magmas lavas are even more fluid and
 

1309
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,270
ios magmas lavas are even more fluid and
and faster moving like what uh how fat

1310
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:37,280
and faster moving like what uh how fat
 

1311
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,149
and faster moving like what uh how fat
like

1312
00:21:38,149 --> 00:21:38,159
like
 

1313
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:39,909
like
if you oh by the way sorry through the

1314
00:21:39,909 --> 00:21:39,919
if you oh by the way sorry through the
 

1315
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:41,190
if you oh by the way sorry through the
telescope

1316
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:41,200
telescope
 

1317
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,590
telescope
are you tracking at what time scale like

1318
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:43,600
are you tracking at what time scale like
 

1319
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,669
are you tracking at what time scale like
what the for every frame

1320
00:21:45,669 --> 00:21:45,679
what the for every frame
 

1321
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,310
what the for every frame
is how far apart if you're looking for a

1322
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:48,320
is how far apart if you're looking for a
 

1323
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,909
is how far apart if you're looking for a
telescope are we talking about

1324
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:49,919
telescope are we talking about
 

1325
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,390
telescope are we talking about
seconds or we're talking about days

1326
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:52,400
seconds or we're talking about days
 

1327
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,110
seconds or we're talking about days
months

1328
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:53,120
months
 

1329
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,270
months
when you kind of track try to get a

1330
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:55,280
when you kind of track try to get a
 

1331
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,710
when you kind of track try to get a
picture of what the surface might look

1332
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:56,720
picture of what the surface might look
 

1333
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,669
picture of what the surface might look
like

1334
00:21:57,669 --> 00:21:57,679
like
 

1335
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:00,230
like
what's the frequency so it depends a

1336
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:00,240
what's the frequency so it depends a
 

1337
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,390
what's the frequency so it depends a
little bit on what you want to do

1338
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:02,400
little bit on what you want to do
 

1339
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,230
little bit on what you want to do
i ideally every night

1340
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:06,240
i ideally every night
 

1341
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,549
i ideally every night
but you could take a frame every second

1342
00:22:08,549 --> 00:22:08,559
but you could take a frame every second
 

1343
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,310
but you could take a frame every second
and see how things are changing

1344
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:10,320
and see how things are changing
 

1345
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,470
and see how things are changing
the the problem with that is that for

1346
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:12,480
the the problem with that is that for
 

1347
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,830
the the problem with that is that for
things to change on a one

1348
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:13,840
things to change on a one
 

1349
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,870
things to change on a one
second time scale you to actually see

1350
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:16,880
second time scale you to actually see
 

1351
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,149
second time scale you to actually see
something change that fast you have to

1352
00:22:18,149 --> 00:22:18,159
something change that fast you have to
 

1353
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,149
something change that fast you have to
have super high resolution the spatial

1354
00:22:20,149 --> 00:22:20,159
have super high resolution the spatial
 

1355
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:21,590
have super high resolution the spatial
resolution we have is a couple hundred

1356
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:21,600
resolution we have is a couple hundred
 

1357
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,110
resolution we have is a couple hundred
kilometers and so

1358
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:23,120
kilometers and so
 

1359
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,830
kilometers and so
okay things are not changing on those

1360
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:25,840
okay things are not changing on those
 

1361
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,909
okay things are not changing on those
scales over one second unless you have

1362
00:22:27,909 --> 00:22:27,919
scales over one second unless you have
 

1363
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,549
scales over one second unless you have
something really crazy happening

1364
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:30,559
something really crazy happening
 

1365
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,549
something really crazy happening
so if you get you if you get a telescope

1366
00:22:32,549 --> 00:22:32,559
so if you get you if you get a telescope
 

1367
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,149
so if you get you if you get a telescope
closer to io

1368
00:22:34,149 --> 00:22:34,159
closer to io
 

1369
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:37,190
closer to io
if you get uh or a camera closer to io

1370
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:37,200
if you get uh or a camera closer to io
 

1371
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,390
if you get uh or a camera closer to io
would you be able to understand

1372
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:38,400
would you be able to understand
 

1373
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,630
would you be able to understand
something is that something of interest

1374
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:40,640
something is that something of interest
 

1375
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,110
something is that something of interest
to you

1376
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:41,120
to you
 

1377
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,630
to you
it would you be able to understand

1378
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:42,640
it would you be able to understand
 

1379
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,310
it would you be able to understand
something deeper about

1380
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:44,320
something deeper about
 

1381
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,270
something deeper about
these volcanic eruptions and how magma

1382
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:47,280
these volcanic eruptions and how magma
 

1383
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,470
these volcanic eruptions and how magma
flows and

1384
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:48,480
flows and
 

1385
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,669
flows and
just the like the rate of the magmas or

1386
00:22:51,669 --> 00:22:51,679
just the like the rate of the magmas or
 

1387
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:52,549
just the like the rate of the magmas or
is it basically

1388
00:22:52,549 --> 00:22:52,559
is it basically
 

1389
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,190
is it basically
enough to have the kilometer resolution

1390
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:55,200
enough to have the kilometer resolution
 

1391
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:55,990
enough to have the kilometer resolution
no way

1392
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:56,000
no way
 

1393
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,390
no way
we want to go there you want to go you

1394
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:58,400
we want to go there you want to go you
 

1395
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,669
we want to go there you want to go you
want to go to iowa i mean i don't want

1396
00:22:59,669 --> 00:22:59,679
want to go to iowa i mean i don't want
 

1397
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,110
want to go to iowa i mean i don't want
to go there personally but i want to

1398
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:01,120
to go there personally but i want to
 

1399
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,310
to go there personally but i want to
send a spacecraft mission there

1400
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:02,320
send a spacecraft mission there
 

1401
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:02,950
send a spacecraft mission there
absolutely

1402
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:02,960
absolutely
 

1403
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,830
absolutely
why why are you scared why am i scared

1404
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:05,840
why why are you scared why am i scared
 

1405
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,310
why why are you scared why am i scared
oh you mean you don't

1406
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:08,320
oh you mean you don't
 

1407
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,110
oh you mean you don't
like i don't want to go there as a human

1408
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:11,120
like i don't want to go there as a human
 

1409
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:11,510
like i don't want to go there as a human
human

1410
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:11,520
human
 

1411
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,190
human
i want to send a robot there to look at

1412
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:13,200
i want to send a robot there to look at
 

1413
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,630
i want to send a robot there to look at
it this is again everybody's

1414
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:14,640
it this is again everybody's
 

1415
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,470
it this is again everybody's
discriminating against robots this is

1416
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:16,480
discriminating against robots this is
 

1417
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,029
discriminating against robots this is
not but it's fine uh but it's not

1418
00:23:19,029 --> 00:23:19,039
not but it's fine uh but it's not
 

1419
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,390
not but it's fine uh but it's not
hospitable to uh

1420
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:20,400
hospitable to uh
 

1421
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,470
hospitable to uh
humans in any way right so it's very

1422
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:22,480
humans in any way right so it's very
 

1423
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,549
humans in any way right so it's very
cold and very hot

1424
00:23:24,549 --> 00:23:24,559
cold and very hot
 

1425
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:28,149
cold and very hot
it's very cold um the atmosphere is

1426
00:23:28,149 --> 00:23:28,159
it's very cold um the atmosphere is
 

1427
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:30,070
it's very cold um the atmosphere is
composed of sulfur dioxide

1428
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:30,080
composed of sulfur dioxide
 

1429
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,909
composed of sulfur dioxide
so you couldn't breathe it there's no

1430
00:23:31,909 --> 00:23:31,919
so you couldn't breathe it there's no
 

1431
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:33,350
so you couldn't breathe it there's no
pressure i mean it's kind of all the

1432
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:33,360
pressure i mean it's kind of all the
 

1433
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,630
pressure i mean it's kind of all the
same things you talk about

1434
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:34,640
same things you talk about
 

1435
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,510
same things you talk about
one talks about about mars only worse

1436
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:37,520
one talks about about mars only worse
 

1437
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,190
one talks about about mars only worse
the atmosphere is still a thousand times

1438
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:39,200
the atmosphere is still a thousand times
 

1439
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,549
the atmosphere is still a thousand times
less dense than mars's

1440
00:23:42,549 --> 00:23:42,559
less dense than mars's
 

1441
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,390
less dense than mars's
and the radiation environment is

1442
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:44,400
and the radiation environment is
 

1443
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,830
and the radiation environment is
terrible because you're embedded

1444
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:45,840
terrible because you're embedded
 

1445
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,470
terrible because you're embedded
deep within jupiter's magnetic field and

1446
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:48,480
deep within jupiter's magnetic field and
 

1447
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,070
deep within jupiter's magnetic field and
jupiter's magnetic field is

1448
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:50,080
jupiter's magnetic field is
 

1449
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,110
jupiter's magnetic field is
full of charged particles that have all

1450
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:53,120
full of charged particles that have all
 

1451
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:53,510
full of charged particles that have all
come

1452
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:53,520
come
 

1453
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,950
come
out of ios volcanoes actually um so

1454
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:56,960
out of ios volcanoes actually um so
 

1455
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,630
out of ios volcanoes actually um so
juveder's magnetic field strips all this

1456
00:23:58,630 --> 00:23:58,640
juveder's magnetic field strips all this
 

1457
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,909
juveder's magnetic field strips all this
material out of ios atmosphere

1458
00:24:01,909 --> 00:24:01,919
material out of ios atmosphere
 

1459
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,510
material out of ios atmosphere
and that populates its entire

1460
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:03,520
and that populates its entire
 

1461
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,190
and that populates its entire
magnetosphere and then that material

1462
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:05,200
magnetosphere and then that material
 

1463
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,110
magnetosphere and then that material
comes back around and hits io and

1464
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:07,120
comes back around and hits io and
 

1465
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,710
comes back around and hits io and
spreads throughout the system actually

1466
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:08,720
spreads throughout the system actually
 

1467
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,430
spreads throughout the system actually
it's just

1468
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:09,440
it's just
 

1469
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,830
it's just
it's like a io is the massive polluter

1470
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:11,840
it's like a io is the massive polluter
 

1471
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,390
it's like a io is the massive polluter
of the jupiter system

1472
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:14,400
of the jupiter system
 

1473
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,430
of the jupiter system
okay cool uh so what uh what is studying

1474
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:17,440
okay cool uh so what uh what is studying
 

1475
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,630
okay cool uh so what uh what is studying
io

1476
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:18,640
io
 

1477
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,590
io
uh teach you about volcanoes on earth or

1478
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:21,600
uh teach you about volcanoes on earth or
 

1479
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,110
uh teach you about volcanoes on earth or
vice versa

1480
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:23,120
vice versa
 

1481
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,630
vice versa
is in the difference of the two

1482
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:26,640
is in the difference of the two
 

1483
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:32,630
is in the difference of the two
what uh insights can you mine out

1484
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:32,640
what uh insights can you mine out
 

1485
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,630
what uh insights can you mine out
that might be interesting in some way

1486
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:34,640
that might be interesting in some way
 

1487
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,149
that might be interesting in some way
yeah it's

1488
00:24:36,149 --> 00:24:36,159
yeah it's
 

1489
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:39,510
yeah it's
we try to port the tools that we use to

1490
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:39,520
we try to port the tools that we use to
 

1491
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,510
we try to port the tools that we use to
study earth volcanism to io and it works

1492
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:41,520
study earth volcanism to io and it works
 

1493
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,789
study earth volcanism to io and it works
to some extent but

1494
00:24:42,789 --> 00:24:42,799
to some extent but
 

1495
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:46,390
to some extent but
it is challenging because the

1496
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:46,400
it is challenging because the
 

1497
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,470
it is challenging because the
situations are so different and the

1498
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:48,480
situations are so different and the
 

1499
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,909
situations are so different and the
compositions are really different when

1500
00:24:49,909 --> 00:24:49,919
compositions are really different when
 

1501
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:50,630
compositions are really different when
you talk about

1502
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:50,640
you talk about
 

1503
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,870
you talk about
outgassing you know earth volcanoes

1504
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:52,880
outgassing you know earth volcanoes
 

1505
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,710
outgassing you know earth volcanoes
outgas primarily

1506
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:54,720
outgas primarily
 

1507
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,870
outgas primarily
water and carbon dioxide and then sulfur

1508
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:56,880
water and carbon dioxide and then sulfur
 

1509
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,630
water and carbon dioxide and then sulfur
dioxide is the the third

1510
00:24:58,630 --> 00:24:58,640
dioxide is the the third
 

1511
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,909
dioxide is the the third
most abundant gas and and on io the

1512
00:25:01,909 --> 00:25:01,919
most abundant gas and and on io the
 

1513
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:05,590
most abundant gas and and on io the
water and carbon dioxide are not there

1514
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:05,600
water and carbon dioxide are not there
 

1515
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,230
water and carbon dioxide are not there
either it didn't form with them or it

1516
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:08,240
either it didn't form with them or it
 

1517
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,230
either it didn't form with them or it
lost them we don't know and so so the

1518
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:10,240
lost them we don't know and so so the
 

1519
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,230
lost them we don't know and so so the
chemistry of how the magma outgasses is

1520
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:12,240
chemistry of how the magma outgasses is
 

1521
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,669
chemistry of how the magma outgasses is
completely different

1522
00:25:13,669 --> 00:25:13,679
completely different
 

1523
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:17,750
completely different
um but the the kind of one to me

1524
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:17,760
um but the the kind of one to me
 

1525
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,390
um but the the kind of one to me
most interesting analogy to earth is

1526
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:20,400
most interesting analogy to earth is
 

1527
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,190
most interesting analogy to earth is
that

1528
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:21,200
that
 

1529
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,789
that
um so io as i've said it has these

1530
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:24,799
um so io as i've said it has these
 

1531
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:26,710
um so io as i've said it has these
really low viscosity magmas the

1532
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:26,720
really low viscosity magmas the
 

1533
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,269
really low viscosity magmas the
the lava spreads really quickly across

1534
00:25:29,269 --> 00:25:29,279
the lava spreads really quickly across
 

1535
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:29,990
the lava spreads really quickly across
its surface

1536
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:30,000
its surface
 

1537
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,470
its surface
it can put out massive volumes of magma

1538
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:32,480
it can put out massive volumes of magma
 

1539
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,230
it can put out massive volumes of magma
in relatively short periods of time

1540
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:34,240
in relatively short periods of time
 

1541
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,310
in relatively short periods of time
and that sort of volcanism is not

1542
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:36,320
and that sort of volcanism is not
 

1543
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,750
and that sort of volcanism is not
happening anywhere else in the solar

1544
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:37,760
happening anywhere else in the solar
 

1545
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,870
happening anywhere else in the solar
system today

1546
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:38,880
system today
 

1547
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,909
system today
but literally every terrestrial planet

1548
00:25:41,909 --> 00:25:41,919
but literally every terrestrial planet
 

1549
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:42,789
but literally every terrestrial planet
and the moon

1550
00:25:42,789 --> 00:25:42,799
and the moon
 

1551
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:46,549
and the moon
um had this what we call very effusive

1552
00:25:46,549 --> 00:25:46,559
um had this what we call very effusive
 

1553
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:49,029
um had this what we call very effusive
volcanism early in their history okay so

1554
00:25:49,029 --> 00:25:49,039
volcanism early in their history okay so
 

1555
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:50,549
volcanism early in their history okay so
this is almost like a little glimpse

1556
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:50,559
this is almost like a little glimpse
 

1557
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,390
this is almost like a little glimpse
into the early history of earth yeah

1558
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:52,400
into the early history of earth yeah
 

1559
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,029
into the early history of earth yeah
okay cool so uh what are the chances

1560
00:25:55,029 --> 00:25:55,039
okay cool so uh what are the chances
 

1561
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:57,350
okay cool so uh what are the chances
that uh a volcano on earth destroys all

1562
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:57,360
that uh a volcano on earth destroys all
 

1563
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,909
that uh a volcano on earth destroys all
of human civilization

1564
00:25:59,909 --> 00:25:59,919
of human civilization
 

1565
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:01,669
of human civilization
maybe i wanted to sneak in that question

1566
00:26:01,669 --> 00:26:01,679
maybe i wanted to sneak in that question
 

1567
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,350
maybe i wanted to sneak in that question
yeah a volcano on earth

1568
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:03,360
yeah a volcano on earth
 

1569
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:07,110
yeah a volcano on earth
um do you think about that kind of stuff

1570
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:07,120
um do you think about that kind of stuff
 

1571
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:07,830
um do you think about that kind of stuff
when you just

1572
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:07,840
when you just
 

1573
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,029
when you just
study volcanoes elsewhere because in it

1574
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:11,039
study volcanoes elsewhere because in it
 

1575
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:12,630
study volcanoes elsewhere because in it
kind of humbling to see something so

1576
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:12,640
kind of humbling to see something so
 

1577
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,269
kind of humbling to see something so
powerful

1578
00:26:13,269 --> 00:26:13,279
powerful
 

1579
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:16,310
powerful
and so hot like so unpleasant for humans

1580
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:16,320
and so hot like so unpleasant for humans
 

1581
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,750
and so hot like so unpleasant for humans
and then you realize we're sitting on

1582
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:17,760
and then you realize we're sitting on
 

1583
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,510
and then you realize we're sitting on
many of them here right

1584
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:19,520
many of them here right
 

1585
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,230
many of them here right
yeah yellowstone as a classic example i

1586
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:22,240
yeah yellowstone as a classic example i
 

1587
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,510
yeah yellowstone as a classic example i
i don't

1588
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:23,520
i don't
 

1589
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,070
i don't
know what the chances are of that

1590
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:26,080
know what the chances are of that
 

1591
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,070
know what the chances are of that
happening my intuition would be that the

1592
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:28,080
happening my intuition would be that the
 

1593
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,669
happening my intuition would be that the
chances of that are lower than the

1594
00:26:29,669 --> 00:26:29,679
chances of that are lower than the
 

1595
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:30,870
chances of that are lower than the
chances of

1596
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:30,880
chances of
 

1597
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,190
chances of
us getting wiped out by some other means

1598
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:33,200
us getting wiped out by some other means
 

1599
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,950
us getting wiped out by some other means
so that in the time

1600
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:34,960
so that in the time
 

1601
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,630
so that in the time
you know that maybe it'll happen

1602
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:36,640
you know that maybe it'll happen
 

1603
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,830
you know that maybe it'll happen
eventually that there will be one of

1604
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:37,840
eventually that there will be one of
 

1605
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,269
eventually that there will be one of
these massive volcanoes on earth but

1606
00:26:39,269 --> 00:26:39,279
these massive volcanoes on earth but
 

1607
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:40,950
these massive volcanoes on earth but
we'll probably be gone by then by some

1608
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:40,960
we'll probably be gone by then by some
 

1609
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,990
we'll probably be gone by then by some
other means

1610
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:42,000
other means
 

1611
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,710
other means
not to sound bleak but it's very

1612
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:44,720
not to sound bleak but it's very
 

1613
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,590
not to sound bleak but it's very
comforting

1614
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:45,600
comforting
 

1615
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:50,950
comforting
okay so can we talk about um europa

1616
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:50,960
okay so can we talk about um europa
 

1617
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:55,350
okay so can we talk about um europa
is there um so maybe can you talk about

1618
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:55,360
is there um so maybe can you talk about
 

1619
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,430
is there um so maybe can you talk about
the intuition the hope that people have

1620
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:57,440
the intuition the hope that people have
 

1621
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,830
the intuition the hope that people have
about life being in europa

1622
00:26:59,830 --> 00:26:59,840
about life being in europa
 

1623
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,710
about life being in europa
maybe also what are the things we know

1624
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:02,720
maybe also what are the things we know
 

1625
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,510
maybe also what are the things we know
about it

1626
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:03,520
about it
 

1627
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,870
about it
what are things to you that are

1628
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:04,880
what are things to you that are
 

1629
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,870
what are things to you that are
interesting about that particular moon

1630
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:06,880
interesting about that particular moon
 

1631
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,470
interesting about that particular moon
of jupiter

1632
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:08,480
of jupiter
 

1633
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,750
of jupiter
sure yeah europa is from many

1634
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:11,760
sure yeah europa is from many
 

1635
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,110
sure yeah europa is from many
perspectives one of the really

1636
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:13,120
perspectives one of the really
 

1637
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,310
perspectives one of the really
interesting

1638
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:14,320
interesting
 

1639
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,909
interesting
places in the solar system among the

1640
00:27:15,909 --> 00:27:15,919
places in the solar system among the
 

1641
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:19,190
places in the solar system among the
solar system moons so there are a few

1642
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:19,200
solar system moons so there are a few
 

1643
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,310
solar system moons so there are a few
there has there's a lot of interest in

1644
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:22,320
there has there's a lot of interest in
 

1645
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,710
there has there's a lot of interest in
looking for or understanding the

1646
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:24,720
looking for or understanding the
 

1647
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,149
looking for or understanding the
potential for life to evolve in the

1648
00:27:26,149 --> 00:27:26,159
potential for life to evolve in the
 

1649
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:27,590
potential for life to evolve in the
subsurface oceans

1650
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:27,600
subsurface oceans
 

1651
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,230
subsurface oceans
i think it's fairly widely accepted that

1652
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:30,240
i think it's fairly widely accepted that
 

1653
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,149
i think it's fairly widely accepted that
the chances of life evolving on the

1654
00:27:32,149 --> 00:27:32,159
the chances of life evolving on the
 

1655
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:35,110
the chances of life evolving on the
surfaces of really anything in the solar

1656
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:35,120
surfaces of really anything in the solar
 

1657
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,510
surfaces of really anything in the solar
system is very low

1658
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:37,520
system is very low
 

1659
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:42,789
system is very low
the radiation environment is too harsh

1660
00:27:42,789 --> 00:27:42,799
the radiation environment is too harsh
 

1661
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:44,710
the radiation environment is too harsh
and there's there's just not liquids on

1662
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:44,720
and there's there's just not liquids on
 

1663
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,830
and there's there's just not liquids on
the surface of most of these things and

1664
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:46,840
the surface of most of these things and
 

1665
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,669
the surface of most of these things and
it's canonically accepted that liquids

1666
00:27:49,669 --> 00:27:49,679
it's canonically accepted that liquids
 

1667
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,029
it's canonically accepted that liquids
are required for life

1668
00:27:51,029 --> 00:27:51,039
are required for life
 

1669
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:53,350
are required for life
um and so the subsurface oceans in

1670
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:53,360
um and so the subsurface oceans in
 

1671
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,110
um and so the subsurface oceans in
addition to maybe titan's atmosphere the

1672
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:55,120
addition to maybe titan's atmosphere the
 

1673
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,830
addition to maybe titan's atmosphere the
subsurface oceans of the icy satellites

1674
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:57,840
subsurface oceans of the icy satellites
 

1675
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,470
subsurface oceans of the icy satellites
uh are one of the most plausible places

1676
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:00,480
uh are one of the most plausible places
 

1677
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,269
uh are one of the most plausible places
in the solar system for life to evolve

1678
00:28:03,269 --> 00:28:03,279
in the solar system for life to evolve
 

1679
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,430
in the solar system for life to evolve
europa and enceladus are interesting

1680
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:05,440
europa and enceladus are interesting
 

1681
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,510
europa and enceladus are interesting
because for many of the big satellites

1682
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:07,520
because for many of the big satellites
 

1683
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,230
because for many of the big satellites
so

1684
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:08,240
so
 

1685
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,549
so
ganymede and callisto also satellites of

1686
00:28:10,549 --> 00:28:10,559
ganymede and callisto also satellites of
 

1687
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:11,830
ganymede and callisto also satellites of
jupiter also are thought to have

1688
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:11,840
jupiter also are thought to have
 

1689
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,430
jupiter also are thought to have
subsurface oceans

1690
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:13,440
subsurface oceans
 

1691
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,789
subsurface oceans
but um they are so they have these ice

1692
00:28:16,789 --> 00:28:16,799
but um they are so they have these ice
 

1693
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,070
but um they are so they have these ice
shells and then there's an ocean

1694
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:18,080
shells and then there's an ocean
 

1695
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,190
shells and then there's an ocean
underneath the ice shell

1696
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:19,200
underneath the ice shell
 

1697
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,350
underneath the ice shell
but on those moons around ganymede we

1698
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:21,360
but on those moons around ganymede we
 

1699
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,710
but on those moons around ganymede we
think that there's another ice shell

1700
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:22,720
think that there's another ice shell
 

1701
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,510
think that there's another ice shell
underneath

1702
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:23,520
underneath
 

1703
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,149
underneath
and then there's rock and the reason

1704
00:28:26,149 --> 00:28:26,159
and then there's rock and the reason
 

1705
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:28,870
and then there's rock and the reason
that that is a problem for life is that

1706
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:28,880
that that is a problem for life is that
 

1707
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,950
that that is a problem for life is that
your ocean is probably just pure water

1708
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:30,960
your ocean is probably just pure water
 

1709
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,470
your ocean is probably just pure water
because it's trapped between two

1710
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:32,480
because it's trapped between two
 

1711
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,909
because it's trapped between two
big shells of ice uh so europa

1712
00:28:35,909 --> 00:28:35,919
big shells of ice uh so europa
 

1713
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,149
big shells of ice uh so europa
doesn't have this ice shell at the

1714
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:38,159
doesn't have this ice shell at the
 

1715
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:39,750
doesn't have this ice shell at the
bottom of the ocean we think

1716
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:39,760
bottom of the ocean we think
 

1717
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,070
bottom of the ocean we think
and so the water and rock are in direct

1718
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:42,080
and so the water and rock are in direct
 

1719
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,070
and so the water and rock are in direct
interaction and so that means that you

1720
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:44,080
interaction and so that means that you
 

1721
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,230
interaction and so that means that you
can basically dissolve a lot of material

1722
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:46,240
can basically dissolve a lot of material
 

1723
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,750
can basically dissolve a lot of material
out of the rock you potentially have

1724
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:47,760
out of the rock you potentially have
 

1725
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,510
out of the rock you potentially have
this hydrothermal activity that's

1726
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:49,520
this hydrothermal activity that's
 

1727
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,789
this hydrothermal activity that's
injecting

1728
00:28:50,789 --> 00:28:50,799
injecting
 

1729
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:53,750
injecting
energy and nutrients for life to survive

1730
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:53,760
energy and nutrients for life to survive
 

1731
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,950
energy and nutrients for life to survive
and so this

1732
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:54,960
and so this
 

1733
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,430
and so this
water interface is is considered really

1734
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:57,440
water interface is is considered really
 

1735
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,470
water interface is is considered really
important

1736
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:58,480
important
 

1737
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,310
important
for the potential habitability

1738
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:02,320
for the potential habitability
 

1739
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,789
for the potential habitability
as a small aside you kind of said that

1740
00:29:04,789 --> 00:29:04,799
as a small aside you kind of said that
 

1741
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,470
as a small aside you kind of said that
it's canonically assumed that

1742
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:06,480
it's canonically assumed that
 

1743
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,510
it's canonically assumed that
uh light water is required for life

1744
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:09,520
uh light water is required for life
 

1745
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,389
uh light water is required for life
is it possible to have life uh like in

1746
00:29:12,389 --> 00:29:12,399
is it possible to have life uh like in
 

1747
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:13,830
is it possible to have life uh like in
the volcano

1748
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:13,840
the volcano
 

1749
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,789
the volcano
i remember people are at that like in

1750
00:29:16,789 --> 00:29:16,799
i remember people are at that like in
 

1751
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:17,830
i remember people are at that like in
that

1752
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:17,840
that
 

1753
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,470
that
national geographic program or something

1754
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:20,480
national geographic program or something
 

1755
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,149
national geographic program or something
kind of hypothesizing that you can

1756
00:29:22,149 --> 00:29:22,159
kind of hypothesizing that you can
 

1757
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:24,070
kind of hypothesizing that you can
really have life anywhere so as long as

1758
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:24,080
really have life anywhere so as long as
 

1759
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,590
really have life anywhere so as long as
there's a source of heat

1760
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:25,600
there's a source of heat
 

1761
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,430
there's a source of heat
a source of energy do you think it's

1762
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:27,440
a source of energy do you think it's
 

1763
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,710
a source of energy do you think it's
possible to have

1764
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:28,720
possible to have
 

1765
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:34,470
possible to have
life in a volcano like no water

1766
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:34,480

 

1767
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,750

i think anything's possible

1768
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:37,760
i think anything's possible
 

1769
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,389
i think anything's possible
i think it's so water it doesn't have to

1770
00:29:40,389 --> 00:29:40,399
i think it's so water it doesn't have to
 

1771
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:41,110
i think it's so water it doesn't have to
be

1772
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:41,120
be
 

1773
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,070
be
water that's sort of you can tell as you

1774
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:44,080
water that's sort of you can tell as you
 

1775
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,430
water that's sort of you can tell as you
identified i phrased that really

1776
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:45,440
identified i phrased that really
 

1777
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,669
identified i phrased that really
carefully it's canonically accepted that

1778
00:29:47,669 --> 00:29:47,679
carefully it's canonically accepted that
 

1779
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:50,389
carefully it's canonically accepted that
um because we recognize that you know

1780
00:29:50,389 --> 00:29:50,399
um because we recognize that you know
 

1781
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:51,990
um because we recognize that you know
scientists recognize that we have no

1782
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:52,000
scientists recognize that we have no
 

1783
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,789
scientists recognize that we have no
idea

1784
00:29:52,789 --> 00:29:52,799
idea
 

1785
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,549
idea
what broad range of life could be out

1786
00:29:54,549 --> 00:29:54,559
what broad range of life could be out
 

1787
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,070
what broad range of life could be out
there and all we really have is our

1788
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:56,080
there and all we really have is our
 

1789
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,070
there and all we really have is our
biases of life as we know it

1790
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:58,080
biases of life as we know it
 

1791
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,669
biases of life as we know it
but for life as we know it it's very

1792
00:29:59,669 --> 00:29:59,679
but for life as we know it it's very
 

1793
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:01,990
but for life as we know it it's very
helpful to have or even necessary to

1794
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:02,000
helpful to have or even necessary to
 

1795
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,430
helpful to have or even necessary to
have some kind of

1796
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:03,440
have some kind of
 

1797
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:07,510
have some kind of
liquid and preferably a polar solvent

1798
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:07,520

1831
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,230

so on
 

1839
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:49,190
so on
or do we need to send robots and do some

1840
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:49,200
or do we need to send robots and do some
 

1841
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,029
or do we need to send robots and do some

i think realistically you need to do the

there's so europa also has these long

00:30:58,389 --> 00:30:58,399
there's so europa also has these long

ocean to be somehow making its way
 

1857
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,950
ocean to be somehow making its way
up onto the surface and you could

1858
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:08,960
up onto the surface and you could
 

1859
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,789
up onto the surface and you could
imagine some out there scenario where

1860
00:31:10,789 --> 00:31:10,799
imagine some out there scenario where
 

1861
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:12,389
imagine some out there scenario where
there's bacteria in the ocean it's

1862
00:31:12,389 --> 00:31:12,399
there's bacteria in the ocean it's
 

1863
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:13,830
there's bacteria in the ocean it's
somehow working its way up through the

ice shell
 

1867
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,230
ice shell
it's spilling out on the surface it's

00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:16,240
it's spilling out on the surface it's
 

1869
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,549
it's spilling out on the surface it's
being killed by the radiation

1870
00:31:18,549 --> 00:31:18,559
being killed by the radiation
 

1871
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,950
being killed by the radiation
but your instrument could detect some

1872
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:20,960
but your instrument could detect some
 

1873
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,350
but your instrument could detect some
spectroscopic signature of that

1874

spectroscopic signature of that
 

1875
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,870
spectroscopic signature of that
dead bacterium but that's you know

1876
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:24,880
dead bacterium but that's you know
 

1877
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,789
dead bacterium but that's you know
that's many ifs and assumptions

1878
00:31:26,789 --> 00:31:26,799
that's many ifs and assumptions
 

1879
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:28,549
that's many ifs and assumptions
that's a hope because then you don't

1880
00:31:28,549 --> 00:31:28,559
that's a hope because then you don't
 

1881
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:29,909
that's a hope because then you don't
have to do that much drilling you can

1882
00:31:29,909 --> 00:31:29,919
have to do that much drilling you can
 

1883
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:32,710
have to do that much drilling you can
collect from the surface right or even

1884
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:32,720
collect from the surface right or even
 

1885
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,230
collect from the surface right or even
i'm thinking even remotely oh remotely

1886
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:36,240
i'm thinking even remotely oh remotely
 

1887
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,909
i'm thinking even remotely oh remotely
yeah that's sad that there's a

1888
00:31:39,909 --> 00:31:39,919
yeah that's sad that there's a
 

1889
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:42,230
yeah that's sad that there's a
single cell civilization living

1890
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:42,240
single cell civilization living
 

1891
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,070
single cell civilization living
underneath all that ice

1892
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:44,080
underneath all that ice

00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,710
underneath all that ice
trying trying trying to get up trying to

1894
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:46,720
trying trying trying to get up trying to
 

1895
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,269
trying trying trying to get up trying to
get out

1896
00:31:47,269 --> 00:31:47,279
get out
 

1897
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:51,110
get out
so enceladus gives you a slightly better

1898
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:51,120
so enceladus gives you a slightly better
 

1899
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:51,909
so enceladus gives you a slightly better
chance of that

1900
00:31:51,909 --> 00:31:51,919
chance of that
 

1901
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:54,230
chance of that
because enceladus is a is a moon of

1902
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:54,240
because enceladus is a is a moon of
 

1903
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,190
because enceladus is a is a moon of
saturn

1904
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:55,200
saturn
 

1905
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,029
saturn
and it's broadly similar to europa in

1906
00:31:59,029 --> 00:31:59,039
and it's broadly similar to europa in
 

1907
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:00,710
and it's broadly similar to europa in
some ways it's an icy satellite it has a

1908
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:00,720
some ways it's an icy satellite it has a
 

1909
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,549
some ways it's an icy satellite it has a
subsurface ocean that's probably

1910
00:32:02,549 --> 00:32:02,559
subsurface ocean that's probably
 

1911
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:05,590
subsurface ocean that's probably
in touch with the rocky interior but it

1912
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:05,600
in touch with the rocky interior but it
 

1913
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,710
in touch with the rocky interior but it
has these massive

1914
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:06,720
has these massive
 

1915
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,310
has these massive
geysers at its south pole where it's

1916
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:08,320
geysers at its south pole where it's
 

1917
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,389
geysers at its south pole where it's
spewing out material that appears to be

1918
00:32:10,389 --> 00:32:10,399
spewing out material that appears to be
 

1919
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:12,710
spewing out material that appears to be
originating all the way from the ocean

1920
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:12,720
originating all the way from the ocean
 

1921
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,990
originating all the way from the ocean
and so in that case you could

1922
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:16,000
and so in that case you could
 

1923
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,870
and so in that case you could
potentially fly through that plume and

1924
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:18,880
potentially fly through that plume and
 

1925
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,870
potentially fly through that plume and
scoop up that material and hope that at

1926
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:20,880
scoop up that material and hope that at
 

1927
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,470
scoop up that material and hope that at
the velocities you'd be scooping it up

1928
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:22,480
the velocities you'd be scooping it up
 

1929
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,149
the velocities you'd be scooping it up
you're not destroying any signature of

1930
00:32:24,149 --> 00:32:24,159
you're not destroying any signature of
 

1931
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:26,710
you're not destroying any signature of
the life you're looking for

1932
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:26,720
the life you're looking for
 

1933
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,870
the life you're looking for
but let's say that you have some

1934
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:28,880
but let's say that you have some
 

1935
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,549
but let's say that you have some
ingenuity and can come up with a way to

1936
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:30,559
ingenuity and can come up with a way to
 

1937
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:31,029
ingenuity and can come up with a way to
do that

1938
00:32:31,029 --> 00:32:31,039
do that
 

1939
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:33,590
do that
you know it potentially gives you a more

1940
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:33,600
you know it potentially gives you a more
 

1941
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,149
you know it potentially gives you a more
direct opportunity at least to try to

1942
00:32:36,149 --> 00:32:36,159
direct opportunity at least to try to
 

1943
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:39,430
direct opportunity at least to try to
measure those bacteria directly

1944
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:39,440
measure those bacteria directly
 

1945
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,470
measure those bacteria directly
can you tell me a little more on uh how

1946
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:42,480
can you tell me a little more on uh how
 

1947
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,029
can you tell me a little more on uh how
do you pronounce it

1948
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:45,039
do you pronounce it
 

1949
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:47,990
do you pronounce it
enceladus enceladus can you tell me a

1950
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:48,000
enceladus enceladus can you tell me a
 

1951
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,590
enceladus enceladus can you tell me a
little bit more about enceladus

1952
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:49,600
little bit more about enceladus
 

1953
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,230
little bit more about enceladus
like uh we've been talking about way too

1954
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:52,240
like uh we've been talking about way too
 

1955
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,070
like uh we've been talking about way too
much about jupiter

1956
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:54,080
much about jupiter
 

1957
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:57,430
much about jupiter
saturn doesn't get enough

00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:57,440

 

1959
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,669

uh saturn doesn't get as much love so

1960
00:32:59,669 --> 00:32:59,679
uh saturn doesn't get as much love so
 

1961
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:01,830
uh saturn doesn't get as much love so
what's what's enceladus uh

1962
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:01,840
what's what's enceladus uh
 

1963
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,070
what's what's enceladus uh
is that the most exciting moon of uh

1964
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:04,080
is that the most exciting moon of uh
 

1965
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:04,870
is that the most exciting moon of uh
saturn

1966
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:04,880
saturn
 

1967
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,750
saturn
depends on your perspective um it's it's

1968
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:07,760
depends on your perspective um it's it's
 

1969
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,350
depends on your perspective um it's it's
very exciting from a

1970
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:09,360
very exciting from a
 

1971
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,669
very exciting from a
astrobiology perspective i think

1972
00:33:11,669 --> 00:33:11,679
astrobiology perspective i think
 

1973
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:12,789
astrobiology perspective i think
enceladus and

1974
00:33:12,789 --> 00:33:12,799
enceladus and
 

1975
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:15,269
enceladus and
titan are the two most unique and

1976
00:33:15,269 --> 00:33:15,279
titan are the two most unique and
 

1977
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:16,789
titan are the two most unique and
interesting moons of saturn that

1978
00:33:16,789 --> 00:33:16,799
interesting moons of saturn that
 

1979
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:18,549
interesting moons of saturn that
definitely both get the most

1980
00:33:18,549 --> 00:33:18,559
definitely both get the most
 

1981
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:21,430
definitely both get the most
attention also from the life perspective

1982
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:21,440
attention also from the life perspective
 

1983
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,230
attention also from the life perspective
um

1984
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:22,240
um
 

1985
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,870
um
so what's more likely uh titan or

1986
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:24,880
so what's more likely uh titan or
 

1987
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,310
so what's more likely uh titan or
enceladus for life

1988
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:28,320

 

1989
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,389

if you were to uh bet all your money in

1990
00:33:30,389 --> 00:33:30,399
if you were to uh bet all your money in
 

1991
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:32,149
if you were to uh bet all your money in
terms of like investing

1992
00:33:32,149 --> 00:33:32,159
terms of like investing
 

1993
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:33,750
terms of like investing
wish to investigate what what are the

1994
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:33,760
wish to investigate what what are the
 

1995
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,350
wish to investigate what what are the
difference between the two

1996
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:35,360
difference between the two
 

1997
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,470
difference between the two
that are interesting to you yeah so

1998
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:38,480
that are interesting to you yeah so
 

1999
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,870
that are interesting to you yeah so
the potential for life in each of those

2000
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:40,880
the potential for life in each of those
 

2001
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,549
the potential for life in each of those
two places is very

2002
00:33:42,549 --> 00:33:42,559
two places is very
 

2003
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:45,269
two places is very
different so titan is the the one place

2004
00:33:45,269 --> 00:33:45,279
different so titan is the the one place
 

2005
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:47,509
different so titan is the the one place
in the solar system where you might

2006
00:33:47,509 --> 00:33:47,519
in the solar system where you might
 

2007
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:49,110
in the solar system where you might
imagine again all of this is so

2008
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:49,120
imagine again all of this is so
 

2009
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,870
imagine again all of this is so
speculative but you might imagine

2010
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:50,880
speculative but you might imagine
 

2011
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,669
speculative but you might imagine
life evolving in the atmosphere so the

2012
00:33:53,669 --> 00:33:53,679
life evolving in the atmosphere so the
 

2013
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:54,630
life evolving in the atmosphere so the
from

2014
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:54,640
from
 

2015
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,470
from
a biology perspective titan is

2016
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:56,480
a biology perspective titan is
 

2017
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,909
a biology perspective titan is
interesting because

2018
00:33:57,909 --> 00:33:57,919
interesting because
 

2019
00:33:57,919 --> 00:33:59,990
interesting because
it forms complex organic molecules in

2020
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:00,000
it forms complex organic molecules in
 

2021
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,509
it forms complex organic molecules in
its atmosphere

2022
00:34:01,509 --> 00:34:01,519
its atmosphere
 

2023
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:03,110
its atmosphere
it has a dense atmosphere it's actually

2024
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:03,120
it has a dense atmosphere it's actually
 

2025
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,110
it has a dense atmosphere it's actually
denser than earth's it's the only moon

2026
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:05,120
denser than earth's it's the only moon
 

2027
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,070
denser than earth's it's the only moon
that has what

2028
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:06,080
that has what
 

2029
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,869
that has what
an atmosphere denser than earth it's got

2030
00:34:08,869 --> 00:34:08,879
an atmosphere denser than earth it's got
 

2031
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:10,470
an atmosphere denser than earth it's got
tons of methane in it what happens is

2032
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:10,480
tons of methane in it what happens is
 

2033
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,149
tons of methane in it what happens is
that methane gets irradiated it breaks

2034
00:34:12,149 --> 00:34:12,159
that methane gets irradiated it breaks
 

2035
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,990
that methane gets irradiated it breaks
up and it reforms with other things in

2036
00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:14,000
up and it reforms with other things in
 

2037
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,270
up and it reforms with other things in
the atmosphere

2038
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:15,280
the atmosphere
 

2039
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,389
the atmosphere
it makes these complex organic molecules

2040
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:18,399
it makes these complex organic molecules
 

2041
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:21,109
it makes these complex organic molecules
and it's effectively doing prebiotic

2042
00:34:21,109 --> 00:34:21,119
and it's effectively doing prebiotic
 

2043
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,190
and it's effectively doing prebiotic
chemistry in the atmosphere

2044
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:23,200
chemistry in the atmosphere
 

2045
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,230
chemistry in the atmosphere
while still being freezing cold uh

2046
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:26,240
while still being freezing cold uh
 

2047
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:29,510
while still being freezing cold uh
yes okay what what would that be like

2048
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:29,520
yes okay what what would that be like
 

2049
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,990
yes okay what what would that be like
would that be pleasant for humans to

2050
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:32,000
would that be pleasant for humans to
 

2051
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,030
would that be pleasant for humans to
hang out there

2052
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:33,040
hang out there
 

2053
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,710
hang out there
it's just really cold there's nowhere in

2054
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:34,720
it's just really cold there's nowhere in
 

2055
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,310
it's just really cold there's nowhere in
the solar system that would be pleasant

2056
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:36,320
the solar system that would be pleasant
 

2057
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,030
the solar system that would be pleasant
for humans

2058
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:37,040
for humans
 

2059
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,109
for humans
um it would be cold you couldn't breathe

2060
00:34:39,109 --> 00:34:39,119
um it would be cold you couldn't breathe
 

2061
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,389
um it would be cold you couldn't breathe
the air um

2062
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:40,399
the air um
 

2063
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:42,629
the air um
but colonization wise if there's an

2064
00:34:42,629 --> 00:34:42,639
but colonization wise if there's an
 

2065
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,710
but colonization wise if there's an
atmosphere isn't that a big plus

2066
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:44,720
atmosphere isn't that a big plus
 

2067
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:48,149
atmosphere isn't that a big plus
or still a ton of radiation

2068
00:34:48,149 --> 00:34:48,159
or still a ton of radiation
 

2069
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:51,990
or still a ton of radiation
so okay so titan

2070
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:52,000
so okay so titan
 

2071
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,349
so okay so titan
that that's a really nice feature that

2072
00:34:53,349 --> 00:34:53,359
that that's a really nice feature that
 

2073
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:54,629
that that's a really nice feature that
the light could be in the atmosphere

2074
00:34:54,629 --> 00:34:54,639
the light could be in the atmosphere
 

2075
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:56,230
the light could be in the atmosphere
because then it's it's that might be

2076
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:56,240
because then it's it's that might be
 

2077
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:59,030
because then it's it's that might be
remotely observable or certainly is more

2078
00:34:59,030 --> 00:34:59,040
remotely observable or certainly is more
 

2079
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,550
remotely observable or certainly is more
accessible if you visit okay

2080
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:02,560
accessible if you visit okay
 

2081
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,589
accessible if you visit okay
so uh what about enceladus so that would

2082
00:35:05,589 --> 00:35:05,599
so uh what about enceladus so that would
 

2083
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:06,630
so uh what about enceladus so that would
be

2084
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:06,640
be
 

2085
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,030
be
still in the ocean right and enceladus

2086
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:09,040
still in the ocean right and enceladus
 

2087
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:09,670
still in the ocean right and enceladus
has

2088
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:09,680
has
 

2089
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,990
has
the advantage like i said of spewing

2090
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:12,000
the advantage like i said of spewing
 

2091
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,510
the advantage like i said of spewing
material out of its south pole so you

2092
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:13,520
material out of its south pole so you
 

2093
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,109
material out of its south pole so you
could collect it but it has

2094
00:35:15,109 --> 00:35:15,119
could collect it but it has
 

2095
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:16,950
could collect it but it has
the disadvantage of the fact that we

2096
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:16,960
the disadvantage of the fact that we
 

2097
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,190
the disadvantage of the fact that we
don't actually really understand

2098
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:19,200
don't actually really understand
 

2099
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,230
don't actually really understand
how its ocean could

2100
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:22,240
how its ocean could
 

2101
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,190
how its ocean could
stay froze or sorry could stay globally

2102
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:25,200
stay froze or sorry could stay globally
 

2103
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:25,990
stay froze or sorry could stay globally
liquid

2104
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:26,000
liquid
 

2105
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,230
liquid
over the age of the solar system and so

2106
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:28,240
over the age of the solar system and so
 

2107
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,230
over the age of the solar system and so
there are some models that say

2108
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:30,240
there are some models that say
 

2109
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,750
there are some models that say
that it's going through this um cyclical

2110
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:33,760
that it's going through this um cyclical
 

2111
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,790
that it's going through this um cyclical
evolution

2112
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:34,800
evolution
 

2113
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,109
evolution
where the ocean freezes completely and

2114
00:35:37,109 --> 00:35:37,119
where the ocean freezes completely and
 

2115
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:39,510
where the ocean freezes completely and
thaws completely and the orbit sort of

2116
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:39,520
thaws completely and the orbit sort of
 

2117
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,829
thaws completely and the orbit sort of
um oscillates in and out of these

2118
00:35:42,829 --> 00:35:42,839
um oscillates in and out of these
 

2119
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:45,829
um oscillates in and out of these
eccentricities um and in that case

2120
00:35:45,829 --> 00:35:45,839
eccentricities um and in that case
 

2121
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:48,230
eccentricities um and in that case
the potential for life ever occurring

2122
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:48,240
the potential for life ever occurring
 

2123
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,990
the potential for life ever occurring
there in the first place is a lot lower

2124
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:50,000
there in the first place is a lot lower
 

2125
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,270
there in the first place is a lot lower
because if you only have an ocean for

2126
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:51,280
because if you only have an ocean for
 

2127
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,310
because if you only have an ocean for
100 million years

2128
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:52,320
100 million years
 

2129
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,750
100 million years
is that enough time and it also

2130
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:55,760
is that enough time and it also
 

2131
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,430
is that enough time and it also
means there might be mass extinction

2132
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:57,440
means there might be mass extinction
 

2133
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,790
means there might be mass extinction
events if it does occur

2134
00:35:58,790 --> 00:35:58,800
events if it does occur
 

2135
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,910
events if it does occur
right it just freezes again very sad man

2136
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:01,920
right it just freezes again very sad man
 

2137
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,829
right it just freezes again very sad man
this is very depressing all the like

2138
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:03,839
this is very depressing all the like
 

2139
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:04,950
this is very depressing all the like
slaughter of

2140
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:04,960
slaughter of
 

2141
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:09,030
slaughter of
life elsewhere how unlikely do you think

2142
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:09,040
life elsewhere how unlikely do you think
 

2143
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,790
life elsewhere how unlikely do you think
life is on earth so when you look

2144
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:12,800
life is on earth so when you look
 

2145
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,950
life is on earth so when you look
when you study other planets and you

2146
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:14,960
when you study other planets and you
 

2147
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,150
when you study other planets and you
study the contents of other planets

2148
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:18,160
study the contents of other planets
 

2149
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:21,190
study the contents of other planets
does that give you a perspective on

2150
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:21,200
does that give you a perspective on
 

2151
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,750
does that give you a perspective on
the origin of life on earth which again

2152
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:23,760
the origin of life on earth which again
 

2153
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,030
the origin of life on earth which again
is full of mystery

2154
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:25,040
is full of mystery
 

2155
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,950
is full of mystery
in itself not the evolution but the

2156
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:26,960
in itself not the evolution but the
 

2157
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,069
in itself not the evolution but the
origin

2158
00:36:28,069 --> 00:36:28,079
origin
 

2159
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:31,510
origin
the first springing to life like from

2160
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:31,520
the first springing to life like from
 

2161
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,310
the first springing to life like from
from nothing to life from the basic

2162
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:34,320
from nothing to life from the basic
 

2163
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,950
from nothing to life from the basic
ingredients to life

2164
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:36,960
ingredients to life
 

2165
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,950
ingredients to life
and i guess another way of asking it is

2166
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:38,960
and i guess another way of asking it is
 

2167
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,710
and i guess another way of asking it is
how unique are we

2168
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:40,720
how unique are we
 

2169
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,990
how unique are we
yeah it's a great question and it's one

2170
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:44,000
yeah it's a great question and it's one
 

2171
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:44,310
yeah it's a great question and it's one
that

2172
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:44,320
that
 

2173
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,150
that
just scientifically we don't have an

2174
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:46,160
just scientifically we don't have an
 

2175
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,430
just scientifically we don't have an
answer to

2176
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:47,440
answer to
 

2177
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,069
answer to
we don't even know how many times life

2178
00:36:50,069 --> 00:36:50,079
we don't even know how many times life
 

2179
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:52,390
we don't even know how many times life
evolved on earth if it was only once or

2180
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:52,400
evolved on earth if it was only once or
 

2181
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,150
evolved on earth if it was only once or
if it happened independently a thousand

2182
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:54,160
if it happened independently a thousand
 

2183
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,150
if it happened independently a thousand
times in different places

2184
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:56,160
times in different places
 

2185
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,670
times in different places
uh we don't know whether it's happened

2186
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:57,680
uh we don't know whether it's happened
 

2187
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,430
uh we don't know whether it's happened
anywhere else

2188
00:36:59,430 --> 00:36:59,440
anywhere else
 

2189
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,750
anywhere else
in the universe although it feels absurd

2190
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:01,760
in the universe although it feels absurd
 

2191
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,550
in the universe although it feels absurd
to believe

2192
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:02,560
to believe
 

2193
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:05,270
to believe
that we are the only life that evolved

2194
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:05,280
that we are the only life that evolved
 

2195
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,630
that we are the only life that evolved
in the entire universe but

2196
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:06,640
in the entire universe but
 

2197
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:11,030
in the entire universe but
it's conceivable we just have just no

2198
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:11,040
it's conceivable we just have just no
 

2199
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,109
it's conceivable we just have just no
real information we don't understand

2200
00:37:13,109 --> 00:37:13,119
real information we don't understand
 

2201
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:14,710
real information we don't understand
really how life came about in the first

2202
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:14,720
really how life came about in the first
 

2203
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,069
really how life came about in the first
place on earth

2204
00:37:16,069 --> 00:37:16,079
place on earth
 

2205
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:17,990
place on earth
i mean so if you look at the drake

2206
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:18,000
i mean so if you look at the drake
 

2207
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,510
i mean so if you look at the drake
equation

2208
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:19,520
equation
 

2209
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,870
equation
that tries to estimate how many alien

2210
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:22,880
that tries to estimate how many alien
 

2211
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,349
that tries to estimate how many alien
civilizations are out there

2212
00:37:25,349 --> 00:37:25,359
civilizations are out there
 

2213
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:28,150
civilizations are out there
planets have a big part to play in that

2214
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:28,160
planets have a big part to play in that
 

2215
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,510
planets have a big part to play in that
equation

2216
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:29,520
equation
 

2217
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,550
equation
if you were to bet money uh

2218
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:32,560
if you were to bet money uh
 

2219
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,270
if you were to bet money uh
in terms of the odds of origins of life

2220
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:35,280
in terms of the odds of origins of life
 

2221
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,069
in terms of the odds of origins of life
on earth

on earth
 

2223
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:37,510
on earth
i mean this all has to do with how

2224
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:37,520
i mean this all has to do with how
 

2225
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,990
i mean this all has to do with how
special and unique is earth

2226
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:40,000
special and unique is earth
 

2227
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,589
special and unique is earth
what you land in terms of the number of

what you land in terms of the number of
 

2229
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:43,910
what you land in terms of the number of
civilizations has to do with

2230
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:43,920
civilizations has to do with
 

2231
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,550
civilizations has to do with
how unique their rare earth hypothesis

2232
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:46,560
how unique their rare earth hypothesis
 

2233
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,510
how unique their rare earth hypothesis
is how

2234
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:47,520
is how
 

2235
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,150
is how
rare special is earth how rare and

2236
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:50,160
rare special is earth how rare and
 

2237
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,470
rare special is earth how rare and
special is the solar system

00:37:58,790 --> 00:37:58,800
well no actually it's actually
 

2247
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,470
well no actually it's actually
rigorously scientific we just don't know

00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:00,480
rigorously scientific we just don't know
 

2249
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,670
rigorously scientific we just don't know
a lot of things

2250
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:01,680
a lot of things
 

2251
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,589
a lot of things
in that equation there's a lot of

2252
00:38:03,589 --> 00:38:03,599
in that equation there's a lot of
 

2253
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:04,870
in that equation there's a lot of
mysteries about that

2254

mysteries about that
 

2255
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,270
mysteries about that
and it's slowly becoming better and

2256
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:07,280
and it's slowly becoming better and
 

2257
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,109
and it's slowly becoming better and
better understood in terms of exoplanets

2258
00:38:09,109 --> 00:38:09,119
better understood in terms of exoplanets

how many solar systems are out there
where there's planets their earth-like

getting better and better understood
 

2269
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,630
getting better and better understood
what's your sense

2270
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:18,640
what's your sense
 

2271
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,510
what's your sense
from that perspective um how many alien

2272
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:21,520
from that perspective um how many alien
 

2273
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,670
from that perspective um how many alien
civilizations out there

2274
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:23,680
civilizations out there
 

2275
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,150
civilizations out there
so zero or one you're right that the

2276
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:26,160
so zero or one you're right that the
 

2277
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,030
so zero or one you're right that the
equation

2278

equation
 

2279
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,589

is is being better understood but you're

2280
00:38:29,589 --> 00:38:29,599
is is being better understood but you're
 

2281
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,030
is is being better understood but you're
really only talking about the first

2282
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:31,040
really only talking about the first
 

2283
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,710
really only talking about the first

there how many planets per star
 

2289
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,310
there how many planets per star
and then we're just barely scratching

2290
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:38,320
and then we're just barely scratching
 

2291
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,750
and then we're just barely scratching
the surface of what fraction of those

2292
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:39,760
the surface of what fraction of those
 

2293
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,589

is it to survive all these things
 

2303
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:52,790
is it to survive all these things
um they're all these huge unknowns

2304
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:52,800
um they're all these huge unknowns
 

2305
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,109
um they're all these huge unknowns
actually i i remember when i first

2306
00:38:55,109 --> 00:38:55,119
actually i i remember when i first
 

2307
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:57,670
actually i i remember when i first
saw that equation i think i was i think

2308
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:57,680
saw that equation i think i was i think
 

2309
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,710
saw that equation i think i was i think
it was my first year

2310
00:38:58,710 --> 00:38:58,720
it was my first year
 

2311
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,550
it was my first year
of college and i thought this is

2312
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:00,560
of college and i thought this is
 

2313
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,310
of college and i thought this is
ridiculous this is

2314
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:02,320
ridiculous this is
 

2315
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,710
ridiculous this is
a common sense that didn't need to give

2316
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:04,720
a common sense that didn't need to give
 

2317
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,670
a common sense that didn't need to give
a given name

2318
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:05,680
a given name
 

2319
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,790
a given name
you know um and b just a bunch of

2320
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:08,800
you know um and b just a bunch of
 

2321
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,990
you know um and b just a bunch of
unknowns it's like

2322
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:10,000
unknowns it's like
 

2323
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,589
unknowns it's like
putting our ignorance together in one

2324
00:39:11,589 --> 00:39:11,599
putting our ignorance together in one
 

2325
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,270
putting our ignorance together in one
equation but i've actually

2326
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:13,280
equation but i've actually
 

2327
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,510
equation but i've actually
now i understand this equation you know

2328
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:15,520
now i understand this equation you know
 

2329
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,310
now i understand this equation you know
it's not

2330
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:16,320
it's not
 

2331
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,390
it's not
something we ever necessarily have the

2332
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:18,400
something we ever necessarily have the
 

2333
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,589
something we ever necessarily have the
answer to it's

2334
00:39:19,589 --> 00:39:19,599
answer to it's
 

2335
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:21,430
answer to it's
it just gives us a framework for having

2336
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:21,440
it just gives us a framework for having
 

2337
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,870
it just gives us a framework for having
the exact conversation we're having

2338
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:22,880
the exact conversation we're having
 

2339
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,670
the exact conversation we're having
right now

2340
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:23,680
right now
 

2341
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,510
right now
and i think that's how it was intended

2342
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:25,520
and i think that's how it was intended
 

2343
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,109
and i think that's how it was intended
in the first place when it was was put

2344
00:39:27,109 --> 00:39:27,119
in the first place when it was was put
 

2345
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:28,790
in the first place when it was was put
into writing was to to give people a

2346
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:28,800
into writing was to to give people a
 

2347
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,710
into writing was to to give people a
language to communicate about

2348
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:30,720
language to communicate about
 

2349
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,030
language to communicate about
the factors that go into the potential

2350
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:33,040
the factors that go into the potential
 

2351
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,270
the factors that go into the potential
for aliens to

2352
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:35,280
for aliens to
 

2353
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,589
for aliens to
be out there and for us to find them um

2354
00:39:37,589 --> 00:39:37,599
be out there and for us to find them um
 

2355
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:39,030
be out there and for us to find them um
i i would

2356
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:39,040
i i would
 

2357
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,230
i i would
put money on there being aliens i

2358
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:42,240
put money on there being aliens i
 

2359
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,510
put money on there being aliens i
would not put money on

2360
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:45,520
would not put money on
 

2361
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,910
would not put money on
us having definitive evidence of them in

2362
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:47,920
us having definitive evidence of them in
 

2363
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,550
us having definitive evidence of them in
my lifetime

2364
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:50,560
my lifetime
 

2365
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,190
my lifetime
well definitive is a funny is a funny

2366
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:53,200
well definitive is a funny is a funny
 

2367
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:53,750
well definitive is a funny is a funny
word

2368
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:53,760
word
 

2369
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,630
word
because uh my sense is this is the

2370
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:56,640
because uh my sense is this is the
 

2371
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,670
because uh my sense is this is the
saddest part

2372
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:57,680
saddest part
 

2373
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,470
saddest part
for me is my sense in terms of

2374
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:00,480
for me is my sense in terms of
 

2375
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,589
for me is my sense in terms of
intelligent alien civilizations

2376
00:40:03,589 --> 00:40:03,599
intelligent alien civilizations
 

2377
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:07,430
intelligent alien civilizations
i feel like we're so

2378
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:07,440
i feel like we're so
 

2379
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,710
i feel like we're so
we're so self-obsessed that we literally

2380
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:10,720
we're so self-obsessed that we literally
 

2381
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,030
we're so self-obsessed that we literally
would not be able to detect them

2382
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:13,040
would not be able to detect them
 

2383
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,430
would not be able to detect them
even when they're like in front of us

2384
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:15,440
even when they're like in front of us
 

2385
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,309
even when they're like in front of us
like like

2386
00:40:16,309 --> 00:40:16,319
like like
 

2387
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:19,430
like like
trees could be aliens but just their

2388
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:19,440
trees could be aliens but just their
 

2389
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,750
trees could be aliens but just their
intelligence could be

2390
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:21,760
intelligence could be
 

2391
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,430
intelligence could be
realized on a scale on a time scale

2392
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:25,440
realized on a scale on a time scale
 

2393
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,270
realized on a scale on a time scale
or physical scale that we're not

2394
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:27,280
or physical scale that we're not
 

2395
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,550
or physical scale that we're not
appreciating

2396
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:28,560
appreciating
 

2397
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,870
appreciating
like trees could be way more intelligent

2398
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:30,880
like trees could be way more intelligent
 

2399
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,589
like trees could be way more intelligent
than us

2400
00:40:31,589 --> 00:40:31,599
than us
 

2401
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:33,430
than us
i don't know it's just a dumb example it

2402
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:33,440
i don't know it's just a dumb example it
 

2403
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,190
i don't know it's just a dumb example it
could be rocks rock

2404
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:35,200
could be rocks rock
 

2405
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,710
could be rocks rock
or it could be things like

2406
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:38,720
or it could be things like
 

2407
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,390
or it could be things like
this i love this this is the dawkins

2408
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:40,400
this i love this this is the dawkins
 

2409
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,550
this i love this this is the dawkins
memes it could be that ideas

2410
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:42,560
memes it could be that ideas
 

2411
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,510
memes it could be that ideas
are the like ideas we have like where do

2412
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:45,520
are the like ideas we have like where do
 

2413
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,109
are the like ideas we have like where do
ideas come from where do thoughts come

2414
00:40:47,109 --> 00:40:47,119
ideas come from where do thoughts come
 

2415
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:47,750
ideas come from where do thoughts come
from

2416
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:47,760
from
 

2417
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:51,270
from
maybe thoughts are the aliens or

2418
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:51,280
maybe thoughts are the aliens or
 

2419
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,990
maybe thoughts are the aliens or
maybe thoughts is the actual mechanisms

2420
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:54,000
maybe thoughts is the actual mechanisms
 

2421
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,829
maybe thoughts is the actual mechanisms
of communication

2422
00:40:55,829 --> 00:40:55,839
of communication
 

2423
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:58,390
of communication
in uh physics right this is like we

2424
00:40:58,390 --> 00:40:58,400
in uh physics right this is like we
 

2425
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,670
in uh physics right this is like we
think of thoughts as something that

2426
00:40:59,670 --> 00:40:59,680
think of thoughts as something that
 

2427
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,829
think of thoughts as something that
springs up from neurons

2428
00:41:01,829 --> 00:41:01,839
springs up from neurons
 

2429
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:05,109
springs up from neurons
firing where the hell they come from

2430
00:41:05,109 --> 00:41:05,119
firing where the hell they come from
 

2431
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:08,230
firing where the hell they come from
and now what about consciousness maybe

2432
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:08,240
and now what about consciousness maybe
 

2433
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,390
and now what about consciousness maybe
consciousness is the communication

2434
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:10,400
consciousness is the communication
 

2435
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,510
consciousness is the communication
it sounds like ridiculous but like

2436
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:13,520
it sounds like ridiculous but like
 

2437
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,069
it sounds like ridiculous but like
we're so self-centered on this uh

2438
00:41:16,069 --> 00:41:16,079
we're so self-centered on this uh
 

2439
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:17,829
we're so self-centered on this uh
space-time

2440
00:41:17,829 --> 00:41:17,839
space-time
 

2441
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:20,150
space-time
communication and physical space using

2442
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:20,160
communication and physical space using
 

2443
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,230
communication and physical space using
like written language

2444
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:22,240
like written language
 

2445
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,670
like written language
like spoken with audio

2446
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:25,680
like spoken with audio
 

2447
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,670
like spoken with audio
on a time scale that's very specific on

2448
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:27,680
on a time scale that's very specific on
 

2449
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,910
on a time scale that's very specific on
a physical scale it's very specific

2450
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:29,920
a physical scale it's very specific
 

2451
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:34,150
a physical scale it's very specific
uh so so i i tend to think that uh but

2452
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:34,160
uh so so i i tend to think that uh but
 

2453
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,230
uh so so i i tend to think that uh but
bacteria will probably recognize like

2454
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:36,240
bacteria will probably recognize like
 

2455
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,990
bacteria will probably recognize like
like moving organisms will probably

2456
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:38,000
like moving organisms will probably
 

2457
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,150
like moving organisms will probably
recognize but when that forms itself

2458
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:40,160
recognize but when that forms itself
 

2459
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,430
recognize but when that forms itself
into intelligence

2460
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:41,440
into intelligence
 

2461
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,349
into intelligence
most likely it'll be robots of some kind

2462
00:41:43,349 --> 00:41:43,359
most likely it'll be robots of some kind
 

2463
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:44,790
most likely it'll be robots of some kind
because we won't be making

2464
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:44,800
because we won't be making
 

2465
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,230
because we won't be making
the origins we'll be meeting the

2466
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:46,240
the origins we'll be meeting the
 

2467
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,910
the origins we'll be meeting the
creations of those

2468
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:47,920
creations of those
 

2469
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,910
creations of those
intelligences we just would not be able

2470
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:49,920
intelligences we just would not be able
 

2471
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,670
intelligences we just would not be able
to to appreciate it and that's the

2472
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:51,680
to to appreciate it and that's the
 

2473
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,109
to to appreciate it and that's the
saddest thing to me

2474
00:41:53,109 --> 00:41:53,119
saddest thing to me
 

2475
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:56,309
saddest thing to me
that uh we we

2476
00:41:56,309 --> 00:41:56,319
that uh we we
 

2477
00:41:56,319 --> 00:42:00,550
that uh we we
yeah we when we're too dumb

2478
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:00,560
yeah we when we're too dumb
 

2479
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,750
yeah we when we're too dumb
to see aliens uh like we're two

2480
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:03,760
to see aliens uh like we're two
 

2481
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,670
to see aliens uh like we're two
we kind of think like look at the

2482
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:05,680
we kind of think like look at the
 

2483
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,270
we kind of think like look at the
progress of science we've accomplished

2484
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:07,280
progress of science we've accomplished
 

2485
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,309
progress of science we've accomplished
so much

2486
00:42:08,309 --> 00:42:08,319
so much
 

2487
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:09,750
so much
the sad thing it could be that we're

2488
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:09,760
the sad thing it could be that we're
 

2489
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,230
the sad thing it could be that we're
just like in the first point zero zero

2490
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:12,240
just like in the first point zero zero
 

2491
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,670
just like in the first point zero zero
zero one percent of understanding

2492
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:13,680
zero one percent of understanding
 

2493
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,670
zero one percent of understanding
anything it's humbling i hope that's

2494
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:15,680
anything it's humbling i hope that's
 

2495
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:16,390
anything it's humbling i hope that's
true

2496
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:16,400
true
 

2497
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,510
true
because i feel like we're very ignorant

2498
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:19,520
because i feel like we're very ignorant
 

2499
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,150
because i feel like we're very ignorant
as a species and i hope that our current

2500
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:22,160
as a species and i hope that our current
 

2501
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,829
as a species and i hope that our current
level of knowledge only represents the

2502
00:42:23,829 --> 00:42:23,839
level of knowledge only represents the
 

2503
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:25,190
level of knowledge only represents the

of what we will someday achieve that

2506
00:42:27,349 --> 00:42:27,359
of what we will someday achieve that
 

2507
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:29,589
of what we will someday achieve that
actually feels optimistic to me

2508
00:42:29,589 --> 00:42:29,599
actually feels optimistic to me
 

2509
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:31,910
actually feels optimistic to me
well that i feel like that's easier for

2510
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:31,920
well that i feel like that's easier for
 

2511
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,470
well that i feel like that's easier for
us to comprehend in the space of biology

2512
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:34,480
us to comprehend in the space of biology
 

2513
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,309
us to comprehend in the space of biology
and not as easy to comprehend in the

2514
00:42:36,309 --> 00:42:36,319
and not as easy to comprehend in the
 

2515
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:38,069
and not as easy to comprehend in the
space of physics for example

2516
00:42:38,069 --> 00:42:38,079
space of physics for example
 

2517
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:39,750
space of physics for example
because we have a sense that like we

2518
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:39,760
because we have a sense that like we
 

2519
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,109
because we have a sense that like we
have

2520
00:42:41,109 --> 00:42:41,119
have
 

2521
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:42,950
have
it like if you if you talk to

2522
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:42,960
it like if you if you talk to
 

2523
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,790
it like if you if you talk to
theoretical physicists

2524
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:44,800
theoretical physicists
 

2525
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,550
theoretical physicists
they have a sense that we understand the

2526
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:46,560
they have a sense that we understand the
 

2527
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,069
they have a sense that we understand the
basic laws

2528
00:42:48,069 --> 00:42:48,079
basic laws
 

2529
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:52,069
basic laws
that form the nature of reality

2530
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:52,079
that form the nature of reality
 

2531
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:55,349
that form the nature of reality
of our universe but so there's much more

2532
00:42:55,349 --> 00:42:55,359
of our universe but so there's much more
 

2533
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,630
of our universe but so there's much more
complex physicists and much more

2534
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:56,640
complex physicists and much more
 

2535
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,750
complex physicists and much more
confident

2536
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:57,760
confident
 

2537
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:01,750
confident
biologists are like uh

2538
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:01,760

 

2539
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,750

this is a squishy mess we're doing our

2540
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:03,760
this is a squishy mess we're doing our
 

2541
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,790
this is a squishy mess we're doing our
best

2542
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:04,800
best
 

2543
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,510
best
uh physicists but i would be it'd be

2544
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:07,520
uh physicists but i would be it'd be
 

2545
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,030
uh physicists but i would be it'd be
fascinating to see if physicists

2546
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:09,040
fascinating to see if physicists
 

2547
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,550
fascinating to see if physicists
themselves would also be humble

2548
00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:10,560
themselves would also be humble
 

2549
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,510
themselves would also be humble
by their being like what the hell is

2550
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:13,520
by their being like what the hell is
 

2551
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,510
by their being like what the hell is
dark matter in dark energy

2552
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:15,520
dark matter in dark energy
 

2553
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:18,390
dark matter in dark energy
what what the hell is the not just the

2554
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:18,400
what what the hell is the not just the
 

2555
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,190
what what the hell is the not just the
origin of the

2556
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:19,200
origin of the
 

2557
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,910
origin of the
not just the big bang but uh everything

2558
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:21,920
not just the big bang but uh everything
 

2559
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,069
not just the big bang but uh everything
that happened since the big bang

2560
00:43:24,069 --> 00:43:24,079
that happened since the big bang
 

2561
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:25,349
that happened since the big bang
a lot of things that happened since the

2562
00:43:25,349 --> 00:43:25,359
a lot of things that happened since the
 

2563
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:26,950
a lot of things that happened since the
big bang we have no ideas about except

2564
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:26,960
big bang we have no ideas about except
 

2565
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,710
big bang we have no ideas about except
basic models of physics right

2566
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:28,720
basic models of physics right
 

2567
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,950
basic models of physics right
what happened before the big bang yeah

2568
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:30,960
what happened before the big bang yeah
 

2569
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,309
what happened before the big bang yeah
yeah what happened before

2570
00:43:32,309 --> 00:43:32,319
yeah what happened before
 

2571
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:33,589
yeah what happened before
or what's happening inside the black

2572
00:43:33,589 --> 00:43:33,599
or what's happening inside the black
 

2573
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:35,109
or what's happening inside the black
hole why is there a black hole at the

2574
00:43:35,109 --> 00:43:35,119
hole why is there a black hole at the
 

2575
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:36,230
hole why is there a black hole at the
center of our galaxy

2576
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:36,240
center of our galaxy
 

2577
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,069
center of our galaxy
can somebody answer this a super massive

2578
00:43:38,069 --> 00:43:38,079
can somebody answer this a super massive
 

2579
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:39,270
can somebody answer this a super massive
black hole

2580
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:39,280
black hole
 

2581
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,510
black hole
nobody knows how it started and they

2582
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:41,520
nobody knows how it started and they
 

2583
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,109
nobody knows how it started and they
seem to be like in the middle of all

2584
00:43:43,109 --> 00:43:43,119
seem to be like in the middle of all
 

2585
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:44,550
seem to be like in the middle of all
galaxies

2586
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:44,560
galaxies
 

2587
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,950
galaxies
um so that could be a portal for aliens

2588
00:43:46,950 --> 00:43:46,960
um so that could be a portal for aliens
 

2589
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,950
um so that could be a portal for aliens
to communicate through conscious okay

2590
00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:48,960
to communicate through conscious okay
 

2591
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:53,030
to communicate through conscious okay
um all right back to planets how um

2592
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:53,040
um all right back to planets how um
 

2593
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,030
um all right back to planets how um
what's your favorite outside of earth

2594
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:55,040
what's your favorite outside of earth
 

2595
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,430
what's your favorite outside of earth
what's your favorite planet or moon

2596
00:43:57,430 --> 00:43:57,440
what's your favorite planet or moon
 

2597
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,990
what's your favorite planet or moon
maybe outside of the ones well first

2598
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:00,000
maybe outside of the ones well first
 

2599
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,670
maybe outside of the ones well first
have we talked about it already

2600
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:01,680
have we talked about it already
 

2601
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,790
have we talked about it already
or and then if we did mention it what's

2602
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:04,800
or and then if we did mention it what's
 

2603
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:05,990
or and then if we did mention it what's
the one outside of that

2604
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:06,000
the one outside of that
 

2605
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,670
the one outside of that
oh gosh and to come up with another

2606
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:07,680
oh gosh and to come up with another
 

2607
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,670
oh gosh and to come up with another

2615
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,870
i mean basically everything i've i've
already said it's just such an amazing

2616
00:44:16,870 --> 00:44:16,880
already said it's just such an amazing
 

2617
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:17,910
already said it's just such an amazing
and unique

2618
00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:17,920
and unique
 

2619
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,950
and unique
object um but

2620
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:20,960
object um but
 

2621
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,230
object um but
on i guess a personal note it's probably

2622
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:24,240
on i guess a personal note it's probably
 

2623
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,670
on i guess a personal note it's probably
the object that

2624
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:25,680
the object that
 

2625
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:28,470
the object that
made me become a planetary scientist

2626
00:44:28,470 --> 00:44:28,480
made me become a planetary scientist
 

2627
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:28,790
made me become a planetary scientist
it's

2628
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:28,800
it's
 

2629
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,790
it's
the first thing in the solar system that

2630
00:44:30,790 --> 00:44:30,800
the first thing in the solar system that
 

2631
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,309
the first thing in the solar system that
really deeply captured my interest

2632
00:44:34,309 --> 00:44:34,319
really deeply captured my interest
 

2633
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:39,109
really deeply captured my interest
um and when i started my phd i wanted to

2634
00:44:39,109 --> 00:44:39,119
um and when i started my phd i wanted to
 

2635
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:39,430
um and when i started my phd i wanted to
be

2636
00:44:39,430 --> 00:44:39,440
be
 

2637
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:42,630
be
an astrophysicist working on things like

2638
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:42,640
an astrophysicist working on things like
 

2639
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,230
an astrophysicist working on things like
galaxy evolution

2640
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:44,240
galaxy evolution
 

2641
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,030
galaxy evolution
um and sort of slowly i had done some

2642
00:44:47,030 --> 00:44:47,040
um and sort of slowly i had done some
 

2643
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,870
um and sort of slowly i had done some
projects in the solar system but io was

2644
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:48,880
projects in the solar system but io was
 

2645
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,790
projects in the solar system but io was
the thing that like really caught me

2646
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:50,800
the thing that like really caught me
 

2647
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,750
the thing that like really caught me
in to doing solar system science okay

2648
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:53,760
in to doing solar system science okay
 

2649
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:54,790
in to doing solar system science okay
let's let's leave

2650
00:44:54,790 --> 00:44:54,800
let's let's leave
 

2651
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,430
let's let's leave
uh moons aside what's your favorite

2652
00:44:57,430 --> 00:44:57,440
uh moons aside what's your favorite
 

2653
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:58,710
uh moons aside what's your favorite
planet

2654
00:44:58,710 --> 00:44:58,720
planet
 

2655
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,150
planet
it sounds like you like moons better

2656
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:00,160
it sounds like you like moons better
 

2657
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,069
it sounds like you like moons better
than planets so it's uh

2658
00:45:02,069 --> 00:45:02,079
than planets so it's uh
 

2659
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:05,030
than planets so it's uh
that's accurate but the planets are are

2660
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:05,040
that's accurate but the planets are are
 

2661
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,349
that's accurate but the planets are are
fascinating i think

2662
00:45:07,349 --> 00:45:07,359
fascinating i think
 

2663
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:09,190
fascinating i think
you know i find the planets in the solar

2664
00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:09,200
you know i find the planets in the solar
 

2665
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,109
you know i find the planets in the solar
system really fascinating what i like

2666
00:45:11,109 --> 00:45:11,119
system really fascinating what i like
 

2667
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:12,230
system really fascinating what i like
about the moons

2668
00:45:12,230 --> 00:45:12,240
about the moons
 

2669
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:15,829
about the moons
is that they there's so much less that

2670
00:45:15,829 --> 00:45:15,839
is that they there's so much less that
 

2671
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:16,390
is that they there's so much less that
is

2672
00:45:16,390 --> 00:45:16,400
is
 

2673
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,309
is
known there's still a lot more discovery

2674
00:45:18,309 --> 00:45:18,319
known there's still a lot more discovery
 

2675
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:20,390
known there's still a lot more discovery
space and the questions that we can ask

2676
00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:20,400
space and the questions that we can ask
 

2677
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,349
space and the questions that we can ask
are still the the bigger questions

2678
00:45:23,349 --> 00:45:23,359
are still the the bigger questions
 

2679
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:25,990
are still the the bigger questions
which you know i and maybe i'm being

2680
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:26,000
which you know i and maybe i'm being
 

2681
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,589
which you know i and maybe i'm being
unfair to the planets because we're

2682
00:45:27,589 --> 00:45:27,599
unfair to the planets because we're
 

2683
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:27,990
unfair to the planets because we're
still

2684
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:28,000
still
 

2685
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,069
still
trying to understand things like was

2686
00:45:30,069 --> 00:45:30,079
trying to understand things like was
 

2687
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:31,430
trying to understand things like was
there ever life on mars

2688
00:45:31,430 --> 00:45:31,440
there ever life on mars
 

2689
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,589
there ever life on mars
and that is a huge question and one that

2690
00:45:33,589 --> 00:45:33,599
and that is a huge question and one that
 

2691
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:34,790
and that is a huge question and one that
we've sent numerous

2692
00:45:34,790 --> 00:45:34,800
we've sent numerous
 

2693
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,990
we've sent numerous
robots to mars to try to answer so maybe

2694
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:38,000
robots to mars to try to answer so maybe
 

2695
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,670
robots to mars to try to answer so maybe
i'm being unfair to the planets but but

2696
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:39,680
i'm being unfair to the planets but but
 

2697
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:40,150
i'm being unfair to the planets but but
there is

2698
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:40,160
there is
 

2699
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,390
there is
certainly quite a bit more information

2700
00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:42,400
certainly quite a bit more information
 

2701
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,910
certainly quite a bit more information
that we have about the planets than the

2702
00:45:43,910 --> 00:45:43,920
that we have about the planets than the
 

2703
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:44,870
that we have about the planets than the
moons

2704
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:44,880
moons
 

2705
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,589
moons
but i mean venus is is a fascinating

2706
00:45:47,589 --> 00:45:47,599
but i mean venus is is a fascinating
 

2707
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:49,190
but i mean venus is is a fascinating
object so

2708
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:49,200
object so
 

2709
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,990
object so
i like the objects that lie at the

2710
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:52,000
i like the objects that lie at the
 

2711
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,190
i like the objects that lie at the
extremes

2712
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:53,200
extremes
 

2713
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:57,030
extremes
i think that if we can make a sort of

2714
00:45:57,030 --> 00:45:57,040
i think that if we can make a sort of
 

2715
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:57,910
i think that if we can make a sort of
theory or

2716
00:45:57,910 --> 00:45:57,920
theory or
 

2717
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,430
theory or
like i've been saying framework for

2718
00:45:59,430 --> 00:45:59,440
like i've been saying framework for
 

2719
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,430
like i've been saying framework for
understanding planets and moons that can

2720
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:01,440
understanding planets and moons that can
 

2721
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,430
understanding planets and moons that can
incorporate even the most extreme ones

2722
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:03,440
incorporate even the most extreme ones
 

2723
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:04,870
incorporate even the most extreme ones
then you know those are the things that

2724
00:46:04,870 --> 00:46:04,880
then you know those are the things that
 

2725
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:05,910
then you know those are the things that
really test your

2726
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:05,920
really test your
 

2727
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:08,150
really test your
theory and test your understanding and

2728
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:08,160
theory and test your understanding and
 

2729
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,150
theory and test your understanding and
so they've always really fascinated me

2730
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:10,160
so they've always really fascinated me
 

2731
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,990
so they've always really fascinated me
not so much the nice habitable places

2732
00:46:11,990 --> 00:46:12,000
not so much the nice habitable places
 

2733
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,109
not so much the nice habitable places
like earth but

2734
00:46:13,109 --> 00:46:13,119
like earth but
 

2735
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:15,430
like earth but
these extreme places like venus that

2736
00:46:15,430 --> 00:46:15,440
these extreme places like venus that
 

2737
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,390
these extreme places like venus that
have

2738
00:46:16,390 --> 00:46:16,400
have
 

2739
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:20,390
have
um sulfuric acid clouds and

2740
00:46:20,390 --> 00:46:20,400
um sulfuric acid clouds and
 

2741
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:23,349
um sulfuric acid clouds and
just incredibly hot and dense surfaces

2742
00:46:23,349 --> 00:46:23,359
just incredibly hot and dense surfaces
 

2743
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:24,470
just incredibly hot and dense surfaces
and venus of course

2744
00:46:24,470 --> 00:46:24,480
and venus of course
 

2745
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:27,510
and venus of course
i love volcanism for some reason and

2746
00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:27,520
i love volcanism for some reason and
 

2747
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:28,069
i love volcanism for some reason and
venus

2748
00:46:28,069 --> 00:46:28,079
venus
 

2749
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:31,349
venus
has probably has volcanic activity

2750
00:46:31,349 --> 00:46:31,359
has probably has volcanic activity
 

2751
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:33,990
has probably has volcanic activity
definitely has in the recent past maybe

2752
00:46:33,990 --> 00:46:34,000
definitely has in the recent past maybe
 

2753
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,510
definitely has in the recent past maybe
has ongoing today what do you

2754
00:46:37,510 --> 00:46:37,520
has ongoing today what do you
 

2755
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,910
has ongoing today what do you
make of the news maybe you can update it

2756
00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:39,920
make of the news maybe you can update it
 

2757
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,150
make of the news maybe you can update it
in terms of life being discovered in the

2758
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:42,160
in terms of life being discovered in the
 

2759
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,030
in terms of life being discovered in the
atmosphere of

2760
00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:43,040
atmosphere of
 

2761
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:46,150
atmosphere of
venus is that sorry okay

2762
00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:46,160
venus is that sorry okay
 

2763
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,589
venus is that sorry okay
you have opinion i can already tell you

2764
00:46:47,589 --> 00:46:47,599
you have opinion i can already tell you
 

2765
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:50,470
you have opinion i can already tell you
have opinions was that fake news

2766
00:46:50,470 --> 00:46:50,480
have opinions was that fake news
 

2767
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:53,190
have opinions was that fake news
i got excited i saw that what's the

2768
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:53,200
i got excited i saw that what's the
 

2769
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,870
i got excited i saw that what's the
what's the final uh

2770
00:46:54,870 --> 00:46:54,880
what's the final uh
 

2771
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,790
what's the final uh
is there a life on venus so the

2772
00:46:56,790 --> 00:46:56,800
is there a life on venus so the
 

2773
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,630
is there a life on venus so the
detection that was reported was the

2774
00:46:58,630 --> 00:46:58,640
detection that was reported was the
 

2775
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,030
detection that was reported was the
detection of the molecule phosphine

2776
00:47:01,030 --> 00:47:01,040
detection of the molecule phosphine
 

2777
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:04,950
detection of the molecule phosphine
um and they said

2778
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:04,960
um and they said
 

2779
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,589
um and they said
that they tried every other mechanism

2780
00:47:07,589 --> 00:47:07,599
that they tried every other mechanism
 

2781
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:10,390
that they tried every other mechanism
they could think of to produce phosphine

2782
00:47:10,390 --> 00:47:10,400
they could think of to produce phosphine
 

2783
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,430
they could think of to produce phosphine
and they none of no mechanism worked

2784
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:13,440
and they none of no mechanism worked
 

2785
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:14,790
and they none of no mechanism worked
and then they said well we know that

2786
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:14,800
and then they said well we know that
 

2787
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,190
and then they said well we know that
life produces phosphine and so that was

2788
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:17,200
life produces phosphine and so that was
 

2789
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:17,670
life produces phosphine and so that was
sort of

2790
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:17,680
sort of
 

2791
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:21,910
sort of
the train of logic and um

2792
00:47:21,910 --> 00:47:21,920
the train of logic and um
 

2793
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,750
the train of logic and um
i don't personally believe that

2794
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:23,760
i don't personally believe that
 

2795
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,349
i don't personally believe that
phosphene was detected in the first

2796
00:47:25,349 --> 00:47:25,359
phosphene was detected in the first
 

2797
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:26,150
phosphene was detected in the first
place

2798
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:26,160
place
 

2799
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,630
place
okay so i mean this is just one study

2800
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:28,640
okay so i mean this is just one study
 

2801
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:29,510
okay so i mean this is just one study
but i

2802
00:47:29,510 --> 00:47:29,520
but i
 

2803
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:32,950
but i
as a layman i'm skeptical

2804
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:32,960
as a layman i'm skeptical
 

2805
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:36,390
as a layman i'm skeptical
a little bit about tools that

2806
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:36,400
a little bit about tools that
 

2807
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,829
a little bit about tools that
sense the contents of an atmosphere like

2808
00:47:39,829 --> 00:47:39,839
sense the contents of an atmosphere like
 

2809
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:43,910
sense the contents of an atmosphere like
contents of an atmosphere from remotely

2810
00:47:43,910 --> 00:47:43,920
contents of an atmosphere from remotely
 

2811
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,829
contents of an atmosphere from remotely
and making conclusive statements about

2812
00:47:45,829 --> 00:47:45,839
and making conclusive statements about
 

2813
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:47,109
and making conclusive statements about
life

2814
00:47:47,109 --> 00:47:47,119
life
 

2815
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:49,030
life
oh yeah well that connection that you

2816
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:49,040
oh yeah well that connection that you
 

2817
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,710
oh yeah well that connection that you
just made the contents of the atmosphere

2818
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:50,720
just made the contents of the atmosphere
 

2819
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:51,670
just made the contents of the atmosphere
to the life

2820
00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:51,680
to the life
 

2821
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:54,710
to the life
yeah is is a tricky one and

2822
00:47:54,710 --> 00:47:54,720
yeah is is a tricky one and
 

2823
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,510
yeah is is a tricky one and
yeah i know that that claim received a

2824
00:47:57,510 --> 00:47:57,520
yeah i know that that claim received a
 

2825
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,109
yeah i know that that claim received a
lot of criticism for

2826
00:47:59,109 --> 00:47:59,119
lot of criticism for
 

2827
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:01,510
lot of criticism for
the lines of logic that went from

2828
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:01,520
the lines of logic that went from
 

2829
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:02,710
the lines of logic that went from
detection to

2830
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:02,720
detection to
 

2831
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:05,910
detection to
uh to claim of life even the detection

2832
00:48:05,910 --> 00:48:05,920
uh to claim of life even the detection
 

2833
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,270
uh to claim of life even the detection
itself though

2834
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:07,280
itself though
 

2835
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:10,069
itself though
did doesn't doesn't meet the sort of

2836
00:48:10,069 --> 00:48:10,079
did doesn't doesn't meet the sort of
 

2837
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:11,030
did doesn't doesn't meet the sort of
historical

2838
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:11,040
historical
 

2839
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:14,470
historical
scientific standards of of a detection

2840
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:14,480
scientific standards of of a detection
 

2841
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:17,910
scientific standards of of a detection
um the it was a very tenuous detection

2842
00:48:17,910 --> 00:48:17,920
um the it was a very tenuous detection
 

2843
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,670
um the it was a very tenuous detection
and only one line of the species was

2844
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:19,680
and only one line of the species was
 

2845
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:20,470
and only one line of the species was
detected

2846
00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:20,480
detected
 

2847
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,349
detected
and a lot of really complicated data

2848
00:48:23,349 --> 00:48:23,359
and a lot of really complicated data
 

2849
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:24,790
and a lot of really complicated data
analysis methods had to be

2850
00:48:24,790 --> 00:48:24,800
analysis methods had to be
 

2851
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,750
analysis methods had to be
applied to even make that weak detection

2852
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:27,760
applied to even make that weak detection
 

2853
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:28,230
applied to even make that weak detection
yeah

2854
00:48:28,230 --> 00:48:28,240
yeah
 

2855
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,870
yeah
um so it could be it could be noise it

2856
00:48:30,870 --> 00:48:30,880
um so it could be it could be noise it
 

2857
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,549
um so it could be it could be noise it
could be polluted data it could be all

2858
00:48:32,549 --> 00:48:32,559
could be polluted data it could be all
 

2859
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:34,309
could be polluted data it could be all
those things and so it doesn't have it

2860
00:48:34,309 --> 00:48:34,319
those things and so it doesn't have it
 

2861
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:35,750
those things and so it doesn't have it
doesn't meet the

2862
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:35,760
doesn't meet the
 

2863
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,990
doesn't meet the
the level of rigor that you would hope

2864
00:48:37,990 --> 00:48:38,000
the level of rigor that you would hope
 

2865
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:38,950
the level of rigor that you would hope
but of course

2866
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:38,960
but of course
 

2867
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:41,190
but of course
i mean we're doing our best and it's

2868
00:48:41,190 --> 00:48:41,200
i mean we're doing our best and it's
 

2869
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,349
i mean we're doing our best and it's
clear that uh

2870
00:48:43,349 --> 00:48:43,359
clear that uh
 

2871
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:46,069
clear that uh
the human species are hopeful to find

2872
00:48:46,069 --> 00:48:46,079
the human species are hopeful to find
 

2873
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:46,950
the human species are hopeful to find
life

2874
00:48:46,950 --> 00:48:46,960
life
 

2875
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,589
life
clearly yes everyone is so excited about

2876
00:48:49,589 --> 00:48:49,599
clearly yes everyone is so excited about
 

2877
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:51,030
clearly yes everyone is so excited about
that possibility

2878
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:51,040
that possibility
 

2879
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,589
that possibility
all right let's uh let me ask you about

2880
00:48:53,589 --> 00:48:53,599
all right let's uh let me ask you about
 

2881
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:56,230
all right let's uh let me ask you about
mars

2882
00:48:56,230 --> 00:48:56,240

 

2883
00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:02,790

so um there's a guy named elon musk

2884
00:49:02,790 --> 00:49:02,800
so um there's a guy named elon musk
 

2885
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,270
so um there's a guy named elon musk
and uh he seems to want to take

2886
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:05,280
and uh he seems to want to take
 

2887
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,190
and uh he seems to want to take
something called dogecoin there

2888
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:07,200
something called dogecoin there
 

2889
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,990
something called dogecoin there
first of the moon i'm just i'm just

2890
00:49:09,990 --> 00:49:10,000
first of the moon i'm just i'm just
 

2891
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,750
first of the moon i'm just i'm just
kidding about the tushcoin i

2892
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:11,760
kidding about the tushcoin i
 

2893
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,630
kidding about the tushcoin i
i even know what the what the heck is uh

2894
00:49:14,630 --> 00:49:14,640
i even know what the what the heck is uh
 

2895
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:16,230
i even know what the what the heck is uh
up with that whole uh

2896
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:16,240
up with that whole uh
 

2897
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:20,150
up with that whole uh
i think uh i think humor

2898
00:49:20,150 --> 00:49:20,160
i think uh i think humor
 

2899
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:24,069
i think uh i think humor
has power in the 21st century

2900
00:49:24,069 --> 00:49:24,079
has power in the 21st century
 

2901
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:27,109
has power in the 21st century
in a way to spread ideas in the most

2902
00:49:27,109 --> 00:49:27,119
in a way to spread ideas in the most
 

2903
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:28,829
in a way to spread ideas in the most
positive way

2904
00:49:28,829 --> 00:49:28,839
positive way
 

2905
00:49:28,839 --> 00:49:32,470
positive way
so i love that kind of humor

2906
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:32,480
so i love that kind of humor
 

2907
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:35,750
so i love that kind of humor
because it makes people smile but it

2908
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:35,760
because it makes people smile but it
 

2909
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:36,790
because it makes people smile but it
also kind of

2910
00:49:36,790 --> 00:49:36,800
also kind of
 

2911
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,870
also kind of
sneak it's like a trojan horse for cool

2912
00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:38,880
sneak it's like a trojan horse for cool
 

2913
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,549
sneak it's like a trojan horse for cool
ideas

2914
00:49:40,549 --> 00:49:40,559
ideas
 

2915
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:43,510
ideas
you you open with humor and you uh like

2916
00:49:43,510 --> 00:49:43,520
you you open with humor and you uh like
 

2917
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,910
you you open with humor and you uh like
the humor is the appetizer and then the

2918
00:49:45,910 --> 00:49:45,920
the humor is the appetizer and then the
 

2919
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:47,430
the humor is the appetizer and then the
main meal is the science and the

2920
00:49:47,430 --> 00:49:47,440
main meal is the science and the
 

2921
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:48,870
main meal is the science and the
engineering

2922
00:49:48,870 --> 00:49:48,880
engineering
 

2923
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:52,630
engineering
anyway uh do you think

2924
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:52,640
anyway uh do you think
 

2925
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:56,829
anyway uh do you think
it's possible to colonize

2926
00:49:56,829 --> 00:49:56,839
it's possible to colonize
 

2927
00:49:56,839 --> 00:50:00,069
it's possible to colonize
mars or other planets in the solar

2928
00:50:00,069 --> 00:50:00,079
mars or other planets in the solar
 

2929
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:01,510
mars or other planets in the solar
system but we're

2930
00:50:01,510 --> 00:50:01,520
system but we're
 

2931
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:04,630
system but we're
especially uh looking to mars is there

2932
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:04,640
especially uh looking to mars is there
 

2933
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,870
especially uh looking to mars is there
something about planets that make them

2934
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:06,880
something about planets that make them
 

2935
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,790
something about planets that make them
very harsh to humans

2936
00:50:08,790 --> 00:50:08,800
very harsh to humans
 

2937
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,150
very harsh to humans
is there something in particular you

2938
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:10,160
is there something in particular you
 

2939
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:11,990
is there something in particular you
think about and maybe

2940
00:50:11,990 --> 00:50:12,000
think about and maybe
 

2941
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,470
think about and maybe
in a high like big picture perspective

2942
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:14,480
in a high like big picture perspective
 

2943
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:15,829
in a high like big picture perspective
do you have a hope we

2944
00:50:15,829 --> 00:50:15,839
do you have a hope we
 

2945
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:18,069
do you have a hope we
we do in fact become a multi-planetary

2946
00:50:18,069 --> 00:50:18,079
we do in fact become a multi-planetary
 

2947
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:19,670
we do in fact become a multi-planetary
species

2948
00:50:19,670 --> 00:50:19,680
species
 

2949
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:23,349
species
i do think that if our species

2950
00:50:23,349 --> 00:50:23,359
i do think that if our species
 

2951
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:25,990
i do think that if our species
survives long enough and we don't wipe

2952
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:26,000
survives long enough and we don't wipe
 

2953
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,750
survives long enough and we don't wipe
ourselves out or get wiped out by some

2954
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:27,760
ourselves out or get wiped out by some
 

2955
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:28,549
ourselves out or get wiped out by some
other means

2956
00:50:28,549 --> 00:50:28,559
other means
 

2957
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:32,230
other means
that we will eventually be able to

2958
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:32,240
that we will eventually be able to
 

2959
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:33,589
that we will eventually be able to
colonize other planets

2960
00:50:33,589 --> 00:50:33,599
colonize other planets
 

2961
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,430
colonize other planets
i do not expect that to happen in my

2962
00:50:35,430 --> 00:50:35,440
i do not expect that to happen in my
 

2963
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:36,950
i do not expect that to happen in my
lifetime i mean

2964
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:36,960
lifetime i mean
 

2965
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:39,190
lifetime i mean
tourists may go to mars tourists people

2966
00:50:39,190 --> 00:50:39,200
tourists may go to mars tourists people
 

2967
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,069
tourists may go to mars tourists people
who commit

2968
00:50:40,069 --> 00:50:40,079
who commit
 

2969
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:41,990
who commit
years of their life to going to mars as

2970
00:50:41,990 --> 00:50:42,000
years of their life to going to mars as
 

2971
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,910
years of their life to going to mars as
a tourist may go to mars

2972
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:43,920
a tourist may go to mars
 

2973
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,309
a tourist may go to mars
um i don't think that we will colonize

2974
00:50:46,309 --> 00:50:46,319
um i don't think that we will colonize
 

2975
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:47,349
um i don't think that we will colonize
it um

2976
00:50:47,349 --> 00:50:47,359
it um
 

2977
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:49,589
it um
is there a sense why it's just too harsh

2978
00:50:49,589 --> 00:50:49,599
is there a sense why it's just too harsh
 

2979
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:51,589
is there a sense why it's just too harsh
of an environment

2980
00:50:51,589 --> 00:50:51,599
of an environment
 

2981
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:54,549
of an environment
to uh to to like it's too costly to

2982
00:50:54,549 --> 00:50:54,559
to uh to to like it's too costly to
 

2983
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:56,870
to uh to to like it's too costly to
build something habitable there

2984
00:50:56,870 --> 00:50:56,880
build something habitable there
 

2985
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:00,230
build something habitable there
for a large population

2986
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:00,240
for a large population
 

2987
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:03,270
for a large population
i think that we need to do a lot of work

2988
00:51:03,270 --> 00:51:03,280
i think that we need to do a lot of work
 

2989
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,829
i think that we need to do a lot of work
and learning how to use the resources

2990
00:51:05,829 --> 00:51:05,839
and learning how to use the resources
 

2991
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:07,030
and learning how to use the resources
that are

2992
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:07,040
that are
 

2993
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,870
that are
on the planet already to do the things

2994
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:08,880
on the planet already to do the things
 

2995
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,309
on the planet already to do the things
we need so if you're talking about

2996
00:51:10,309 --> 00:51:10,319
we need so if you're talking about
 

2997
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:12,790
we need so if you're talking about
someone going there for a few months

2998
00:51:12,790 --> 00:51:12,800
someone going there for a few months
 

2999
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:17,349
someone going there for a few months
um so back up a little bit

3000
00:51:17,349 --> 00:51:17,359
um so back up a little bit
 

3001
00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:19,589
um so back up a little bit
there are many things that make mars not

3002
00:51:19,589 --> 00:51:19,599
there are many things that make mars not
 

3003
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:20,630
there are many things that make mars not
hospitable

3004
00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:20,640
hospitable
 

3005
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,710
hospitable
temperature you can't breathe air you

3006
00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:22,720
temperature you can't breathe air you
 

3007
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,069
temperature you can't breathe air you
need a pressure suit

3008
00:51:24,069 --> 00:51:24,079
need a pressure suit
 

3009
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:25,510
need a pressure suit
even if you're on the surface the

3010
00:51:25,510 --> 00:51:25,520
even if you're on the surface the
 

3011
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,750
even if you're on the surface the
radiation environment is you know even

3012
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:27,760
radiation environment is you know even
 

3013
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:28,950
radiation environment is you know even
in all those things the radiation

3014
00:51:28,950 --> 00:51:28,960
in all those things the radiation
 

3015
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,630
in all those things the radiation
environment is too harsh for the human

3016
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:30,640
environment is too harsh for the human
 

3017
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:31,510
environment is too harsh for the human
body

3018
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:31,520
body
 

3019
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,990
body
um all of those things seem like they

3020
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:34,000
um all of those things seem like they
 

3021
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,990
um all of those things seem like they
could eventually have

3022
00:51:35,990 --> 00:51:36,000
could eventually have
 

3023
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,190
could eventually have
technological solutions

3024
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:39,200
technological solutions
 

3025
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:42,230
technological solutions
the challenge the the real

3026
00:51:42,230 --> 00:51:42,240
the challenge the the real
 

3027
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:44,790
the challenge the the real
significant challenge to me seems to be

3028
00:51:44,790 --> 00:51:44,800
significant challenge to me seems to be
 

3029
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,150
significant challenge to me seems to be
the the creation

3030
00:51:46,150 --> 00:51:46,160
the the creation
 

3031
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:49,349
the the creation
of a self-sustaining civilization there

3032
00:51:49,349 --> 00:51:49,359
of a self-sustaining civilization there
 

3033
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:49,990
of a self-sustaining civilization there
you know you

3034
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:50,000
you know you
 

3035
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,390
you know you
can bring pressure suits you can bring

3036
00:51:52,390 --> 00:51:52,400
can bring pressure suits you can bring
 

3037
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,150
can bring pressure suits you can bring
oxygen to breathe but those are all in

3038
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:54,160
oxygen to breathe but those are all in
 

3039
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,589
oxygen to breathe but those are all in
limited supply and if we're going to

3040
00:51:55,589 --> 00:51:55,599
limited supply and if we're going to
 

3041
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:57,670
limited supply and if we're going to
colonize it we need to find

3042
00:51:57,670 --> 00:51:57,680
colonize it we need to find
 

3043
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:00,069
colonize it we need to find
ways to make use of the resources that

3044
00:52:00,069 --> 00:52:00,079
ways to make use of the resources that
 

3045
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:01,910
ways to make use of the resources that
are there to do things like

3046
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:01,920
are there to do things like
 

3047
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:04,309
are there to do things like
produce food produce the air the humans

3048
00:52:04,309 --> 00:52:04,319
produce food produce the air the humans
 

3049
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:05,910
produce food produce the air the humans
need to keep breathing just in order to

3050
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:05,920
need to keep breathing just in order to
 

3051
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,190
need to keep breathing just in order to
make it self-sustaining there's a

3052
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:07,200
make it self-sustaining there's a
 

3053
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,870
make it self-sustaining there's a
tremendous amount of work that has to be

3054
00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:08,880
tremendous amount of work that has to be
 

3055
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:09,430
tremendous amount of work that has to be
done

3056
00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:09,440
done
 

3057
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:11,829
done
and people are working on these problems

3058
00:52:11,829 --> 00:52:11,839
and people are working on these problems
 

3059
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:12,790
and people are working on these problems
but

3060
00:52:12,790 --> 00:52:12,800
but
 

3061
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,950
but
i think that's going to be a major

3062
00:52:14,950 --> 00:52:14,960
i think that's going to be a major
 

3063
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:16,630
i think that's going to be a major
obstacle in going from

3064
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:16,640
obstacle in going from
 

3065
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,230
obstacle in going from
visiting where we can bring everything

3066
00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:18,240
visiting where we can bring everything
 

3067
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:20,309
visiting where we can bring everything
we need to survive in the short term to

3068
00:52:20,309 --> 00:52:20,319
we need to survive in the short term to
 

3069
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:22,710
we need to survive in the short term to
actually colonizing

3070
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:22,720
actually colonizing
 

3071
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:26,549
actually colonizing
yeah i find that whole project

3072
00:52:26,549 --> 00:52:26,559
yeah i find that whole project
 

3073
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:29,190
yeah i find that whole project
of the human species quite inspiring

3074
00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:29,200
of the human species quite inspiring
 

3075
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,390
of the human species quite inspiring
these like huge

3076
00:52:30,390 --> 00:52:30,400
these like huge
 

3077
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:34,950
these like huge
moonshot projects somebody i was reading

3078
00:52:34,950 --> 00:52:34,960
moonshot projects somebody i was reading
 

3079
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,190
moonshot projects somebody i was reading
something um in terms of the source of

3080
00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:37,200
something um in terms of the source of
 

3081
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,790
something um in terms of the source of
food that's that may be the most

3082
00:52:38,790 --> 00:52:38,800
food that's that may be the most
 

3083
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,470
food that's that may be the most
effective on mars

3084
00:52:40,470 --> 00:52:40,480
effective on mars
 

3085
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,950
effective on mars
is you could farm insects that's the

3086
00:52:42,950 --> 00:52:42,960
is you could farm insects that's the
 

3087
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,710
is you could farm insects that's the
easiest thing to farm

3088
00:52:44,710 --> 00:52:44,720
easiest thing to farm
 

3089
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:47,990
easiest thing to farm
so would be eating like cockroaches

3090
00:52:47,990 --> 00:52:48,000
so would be eating like cockroaches
 

3091
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,230
so would be eating like cockroaches
if we're living on mars because that's

3092
00:52:50,230 --> 00:52:50,240
if we're living on mars because that's
 

3093
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:51,750
if we're living on mars because that's
the easiest thing to actually

3094
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:51,760
the easiest thing to actually
 

3095
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:55,109
the easiest thing to actually
um as a source of protein so growing a

limits of the human mind and the human
 

3201
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,470
limits of the human mind and the human
body are it's like what the hell else is

scientist
 

3223
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:18,069
scientist
i think i've i've loved the idea of

3224
00:55:18,069 --> 00:55:18,079
i think i've i've loved the idea of
 

3225
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:19,349
i think i've i've loved the idea of
humans striving

3226

humans striving
 

3227
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:22,150
humans striving
out towards the stars always like from

3228
00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:22,160
out towards the stars always like from
 

3229
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:23,750
out towards the stars always like from
the engineering perspective

3230
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:23,760
the engineering perspective
 

3231
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,109
the engineering perspective
has been really exciting i don't know if

3232
00:55:25,109 --> 00:55:25,119
has been really exciting i don't know if
 

3233
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:26,549
has been really exciting i don't know if
people love that as much in america

3234
00:55:26,549 --> 00:55:26,559
people love that as much in america
 

3235
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:27,510
people love that as much in america
anymore i think

3236
00:55:27,510 --> 00:55:27,520
anymore i think
 

3237
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:30,309
anymore i think
elon is bringing that back a little bit

3238
00:55:30,309 --> 00:55:30,319
elon is bringing that back a little bit
 

3239
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:32,390
elon is bringing that back a little bit
that excitement about rockets and

3240
00:55:32,390 --> 00:55:32,400
that excitement about rockets and
 

3241
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:35,670
that excitement about rockets and
going out there but uh so that's that's

3242
00:55:35,670 --> 00:55:35,680
going out there but uh so that's that's
 

3243
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:37,109
going out there but uh so that's that's
hopeful but for me i always loved that

3244
00:55:37,109 --> 00:55:37,119
hopeful but for me i always loved that
 

3245
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:37,910
hopeful but for me i always loved that
idea

3246
00:55:37,910 --> 00:55:37,920
idea
 

3247
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:40,950
idea
from uh alien scientist perspective if

3248
00:55:40,950 --> 00:55:40,960
from uh alien scientist perspective if
 

3249
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:42,069
from uh alien scientist perspective if
you were to look

3250
00:55:42,069 --> 00:55:42,079
you were to look
 

3251
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:46,230
you were to look
back on earth

3252
00:55:46,230 --> 00:55:46,240

 

3253
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,230

is there something interesting you could

3254
00:55:48,230 --> 00:55:48,240
is there something interesting you could
 

3255
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:49,829
is there something interesting you could
say about earth like how would you

3256
00:55:49,829 --> 00:55:49,839
say about earth like how would you
 

3257
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:51,589
say about earth like how would you
summarize earth

3258
00:55:51,589 --> 00:55:51,599
summarize earth
 

3259
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:53,190
summarize earth
like in a report you know like uh

3260
00:55:53,190 --> 00:55:53,200
like in a report you know like uh
 

3261
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:54,870
like in a report you know like uh
hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy

3262
00:55:54,870 --> 00:55:54,880
hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy
 

3263
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:57,589
hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy
like if you had to report like write a

3264
00:55:57,589 --> 00:55:57,599
like if you had to report like write a
 

3265
00:55:57,599 --> 00:55:58,789
like if you had to report like write a
paper on earth

3266
00:55:58,789 --> 00:55:58,799
paper on earth
 

3267
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:02,390
paper on earth
or like a letter like a like a one pager

3268
00:56:02,390 --> 00:56:02,400
or like a letter like a like a one pager
 

3269
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,390
or like a letter like a like a one pager
um summarizing the contents of the

3270
00:56:04,390 --> 00:56:04,400
um summarizing the contents of the
 

3271
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:05,910
um summarizing the contents of the
surface and the atmosphere is there is

3272
00:56:05,910 --> 00:56:05,920
surface and the atmosphere is there is
 

3273
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:07,030
surface and the atmosphere is there is
there something interesting

3274
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:07,040
there something interesting
 

3275
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:08,069
there something interesting
like do you ever take that kind of

3276
00:56:08,069 --> 00:56:08,079
like do you ever take that kind of
 

3277
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:11,030
like do you ever take that kind of
perspective on it

3278
00:56:11,030 --> 00:56:11,040

 

3279
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:13,430

i know you like volcanism so volcanoes

3280
00:56:13,430 --> 00:56:13,440
i know you like volcanism so volcanoes
 

3281
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:14,870
i know you like volcanism so volcanoes
that will probably be in the report

3282
00:56:14,870 --> 00:56:14,880
that will probably be in the report
 

3283
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,390
that will probably be in the report
and i was gonna say that's where i was

3284
00:56:16,390 --> 00:56:16,400
and i was gonna say that's where i was
 

3285
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,069
and i was gonna say that's where i was
gonna go first uh there are a few things

3286
00:56:18,069 --> 00:56:18,079
gonna go first uh there are a few things
 

3287
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:19,670
gonna go first uh there are a few things
to say about the atmosphere but in terms

3288
00:56:19,670 --> 00:56:19,680
to say about the atmosphere but in terms
 

3289
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:20,789
to say about the atmosphere but in terms
of the volcano so

3290
00:56:20,789 --> 00:56:20,799
of the volcano so
 

3291
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:24,069
of the volcano so
one of the really interesting

3292
00:56:24,069 --> 00:56:24,079
one of the really interesting
 

3293
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:27,430
one of the really interesting
puzzles to me in planetary sciences

3294
00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:27,440
puzzles to me in planetary sciences
 

3295
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:28,789
puzzles to me in planetary sciences
so we can we can look out there and

3296
00:56:28,789 --> 00:56:28,799
so we can we can look out there and
 

3297
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:31,030
so we can we can look out there and
we've been talking about surfaces and

3298
00:56:31,030 --> 00:56:31,040
we've been talking about surfaces and
 

3299
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:32,789
we've been talking about surfaces and
volcanoes and atmospheres and things

3300
00:56:32,789 --> 00:56:32,799
volcanoes and atmospheres and things
 

3301
00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:33,670
volcanoes and atmospheres and things
like that

3302
00:56:33,670 --> 00:56:33,680
like that
 

3303
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:35,910
like that
but that is just you know this tiny

3304
00:56:35,910 --> 00:56:35,920
but that is just you know this tiny
 

3305
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,270
but that is just you know this tiny
little veneer on the outside of the

3306
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:37,280
little veneer on the outside of the
 

3307
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:39,270
little veneer on the outside of the
planet and most of the planet is

3308
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:39,280
planet and most of the planet is
 

3309
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:41,430
planet and most of the planet is
completely sort of inaccessible to

3310
00:56:41,430 --> 00:56:41,440
completely sort of inaccessible to
 

3311
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,270
completely sort of inaccessible to
telescopes or to spacecraft missions you

3312
00:56:43,270 --> 00:56:43,280
telescopes or to spacecraft missions you
 

3313
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:45,030
telescopes or to spacecraft missions you
can drill a meter into the surface but

3314
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:45,040
can drill a meter into the surface but
 

3315
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:47,270
can drill a meter into the surface but
you know that's still really the veneer

3316
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:47,280
you know that's still really the veneer
 

3317
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:50,549
you know that's still really the veneer
um and one of the cool puzzles is

3318
00:56:50,549 --> 00:56:50,559
um and one of the cool puzzles is
 

3319
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:52,069
um and one of the cool puzzles is
looking at what's going on

3320
00:56:52,069 --> 00:56:52,079
looking at what's going on
 

3321
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:54,789
looking at what's going on
on the surface and trying to figure out

3322
00:56:54,789 --> 00:56:54,799
on the surface and trying to figure out
 

3323
00:56:54,799 --> 00:56:55,670
on the surface and trying to figure out
what's happening

3324
00:56:55,670 --> 00:56:55,680
what's happening
 

3325
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:58,710
what's happening
underneath or just any kind of indirect

3326
00:56:58,710 --> 00:56:58,720
underneath or just any kind of indirect
 

3327
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,230
underneath or just any kind of indirect
means that you have to study the

3328
00:57:00,230 --> 00:57:00,240
means that you have to study the
 

3329
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:02,150
means that you have to study the
interior because you can't

3330
00:57:02,150 --> 00:57:02,160
interior because you can't
 

3331
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:03,990
interior because you can't
dig into it directly even on earth you

3332
00:57:03,990 --> 00:57:04,000
dig into it directly even on earth you
 

3333
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,549
dig into it directly even on earth you
can't dig deep into earth

3334
00:57:06,549 --> 00:57:06,559
can't dig deep into earth
 

3335
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:09,030
can't dig deep into earth
so from that perspective looking at

3336
00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:09,040
so from that perspective looking at
 

3337
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:11,190
so from that perspective looking at
earth

3338
00:57:11,190 --> 00:57:11,200
earth
 

3339
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:13,270
earth
one thing that you would be able to tell

3340
00:57:13,270 --> 00:57:13,280
one thing that you would be able to tell
 

3341
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:15,589
one thing that you would be able to tell
from orbit given enough time

3342
00:57:15,589 --> 00:57:15,599
from orbit given enough time
 

3343
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:18,950
from orbit given enough time
is that earth has tectonic plates so you

3344
00:57:18,950 --> 00:57:18,960
is that earth has tectonic plates so you
 

3345
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:19,990
is that earth has tectonic plates so you
would see

3346
00:57:19,990 --> 00:57:20,000
would see
 

3347
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,030
would see
that volcanoes follow the edges if you

3348
00:57:23,030 --> 00:57:23,040
that volcanoes follow the edges if you
 

3349
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,470
that volcanoes follow the edges if you
trace where all the volcanoes are on

3350
00:57:24,470 --> 00:57:24,480
trace where all the volcanoes are on
 

3351
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,150
trace where all the volcanoes are on
earth they follow these

3352
00:57:26,150 --> 00:57:26,160
earth they follow these
 

3353
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:28,150
earth they follow these
lines that trace the edges of the plates

3354
00:57:28,150 --> 00:57:28,160
lines that trace the edges of the plates
 

3355
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:29,670
lines that trace the edges of the plates
and similarly you would see

3356
00:57:29,670 --> 00:57:29,680
and similarly you would see
 

3357
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:32,789
and similarly you would see
things like the hawaiian string of

3358
00:57:32,789 --> 00:57:32,799
things like the hawaiian string of
 

3359
00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:34,390
things like the hawaiian string of
volcanoes that

3360
00:57:34,390 --> 00:57:34,400
volcanoes that
 

3361
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,789
volcanoes that
you could infer just like you know we

3362
00:57:36,789 --> 00:57:36,799
you could infer just like you know we
 

3363
00:57:36,799 --> 00:57:37,510
you could infer just like you know we
did

3364
00:57:37,510 --> 00:57:37,520
did
 

3365
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:39,109
did
as people actually living on earth that

3366
00:57:39,109 --> 00:57:39,119
as people actually living on earth that
 

3367
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:41,270
as people actually living on earth that
the plates are moving over some plume

3368
00:57:41,270 --> 00:57:41,280
the plates are moving over some plume
 

3369
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:43,030
the plates are moving over some plume
that's coming up through the mantle

3370
00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:43,040
that's coming up through the mantle
 

3371
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:45,829
that's coming up through the mantle
and so you could use that to say if the

3372
00:57:45,829 --> 00:57:45,839
and so you could use that to say if the
 

3373
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:47,589
and so you could use that to say if the
aliens could look at where the volcanoes

3374
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:47,599
aliens could look at where the volcanoes
 

3375
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:47,990
aliens could look at where the volcanoes
are

3376
00:57:47,990 --> 00:57:48,000
are
 

3377
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,750
are
are happening on earth and say something

3378
00:57:49,750 --> 00:57:49,760
are happening on earth and say something
 

3379
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,030
are happening on earth and say something
about the fact that earth has plate

3380
00:57:51,030 --> 00:57:51,040
about the fact that earth has plate
 

3381
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:53,190
about the fact that earth has plate
tectonics which makes it really unique

3382
00:57:53,190 --> 00:57:53,200
tectonics which makes it really unique
 

3383
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,829
tectonics which makes it really unique
in the solar system okay so the other

3384
00:57:55,829 --> 00:57:55,839
in the solar system okay so the other
 

3385
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:56,630
in the solar system okay so the other
plants don't have

3386
00:57:56,630 --> 00:57:56,640
plants don't have
 

3387
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:57,829
plants don't have
it's the only one that has plate

3388
00:57:57,829 --> 00:57:57,839
it's the only one that has plate
 

3389
00:57:57,839 --> 00:58:00,549
it's the only one that has plate
tectonics yeah what about io

3390
00:58:00,549 --> 00:58:00,559
tectonics yeah what about io
 

3391
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:02,710
tectonics yeah what about io
and the the friction and all that that's

3392
00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:02,720
and the the friction and all that that's
 

3393
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:04,150
and the the friction and all that that's
not play tech what's the difference

3394
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:04,160
not play tech what's the difference
 

3395
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:05,829
not play tech what's the difference
between

3396
00:58:05,829 --> 00:58:05,839
between
 

3397
00:58:05,839 --> 00:58:07,750
between
so oh it's plate tectonics like another

3398
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:07,760
so oh it's plate tectonics like another
 

3399
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:08,950
so oh it's plate tectonics like another
layer of like

3400
00:58:08,950 --> 00:58:08,960
layer of like
 

3401
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:11,589
layer of like
solid rock that moves around and there's

3402
00:58:11,589 --> 00:58:11,599
solid rock that moves around and there's
 

3403
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:12,630
solid rock that moves around and there's
cracks

3404
00:58:12,630 --> 00:58:12,640
cracks
 

3405
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:15,910
cracks
yeah so so earth has plates of solid

3406
00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:15,920
yeah so so earth has plates of solid
 

3407
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:16,309
yeah so so earth has plates of solid
rock

3408
00:58:16,309 --> 00:58:16,319
rock
 

3409
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:18,470
rock
sitting on top of a partially molten

3410
00:58:18,470 --> 00:58:18,480
sitting on top of a partially molten
 

3411
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,710
sitting on top of a partially molten
layer and those plates are kind of

3412
00:58:20,710 --> 00:58:20,720
layer and those plates are kind of
 

3413
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:24,630
layer and those plates are kind of
shifting around on io

3414
00:58:24,630 --> 00:58:24,640
shifting around on io
 

3415
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:26,710
shifting around on io
it doesn't have that and the volcanism

3416
00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:26,720
it doesn't have that and the volcanism
 

3417
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:27,910
it doesn't have that and the volcanism
is what we call heat pipe

3418
00:58:27,910 --> 00:58:27,920
is what we call heat pipe
 

3419
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:30,230
is what we call heat pipe
volcanism it's the magma just punches a

3420
00:58:30,230 --> 00:58:30,240
volcanism it's the magma just punches a
 

3421
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,150
volcanism it's the magma just punches a
hole through the crust and comes out on

3422
00:58:32,150 --> 00:58:32,160
hole through the crust and comes out on
 

3423
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,190
hole through the crust and comes out on
the surface i mean that's a

3424
00:58:33,190 --> 00:58:33,200
the surface i mean that's a
 

3425
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:34,950
the surface i mean that's a
simplification but that's effectively

3426
00:58:34,950 --> 00:58:34,960
simplification but that's effectively
 

3427
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:35,990
simplification but that's effectively
what's happening

3428
00:58:35,990 --> 00:58:36,000
what's happening
 

3429
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,270
what's happening
through the freezing cold crust yes very

3430
00:58:39,270 --> 00:58:39,280
through the freezing cold crust yes very
 

3431
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:39,910
through the freezing cold crust yes very
cold

3432
00:58:39,910 --> 00:58:39,920
cold
 

3433
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:42,630
cold
very rigid crust yeah how do you how

3434
00:58:42,630 --> 00:58:42,640
very rigid crust yeah how do you how
 

3435
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:45,190
very rigid crust yeah how do you how
does that look like by the way

3436
00:58:45,190 --> 00:58:45,200
does that look like by the way
 

3437
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:47,109
does that look like by the way
i don't think we've mentioned so the gas

3438
00:58:47,109 --> 00:58:47,119
i don't think we've mentioned so the gas
 

3439
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:48,309
i don't think we've mentioned so the gas
that's expelled

3440
00:58:48,309 --> 00:58:48,319
that's expelled
 

3441
00:58:48,319 --> 00:58:49,829
that's expelled
like if we were to look at it does it

3442
00:58:49,829 --> 00:58:49,839
like if we were to look at it does it
 

3443
00:58:49,839 --> 00:58:51,750
like if we were to look at it does it
look beautiful does it look boring

3444
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:51,760
look beautiful does it look boring
 

3445
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:54,549
look beautiful does it look boring
the gas like the whole thing like the

3446
00:58:54,549 --> 00:58:54,559
the gas like the whole thing like the
 

3447
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:55,910
the gas like the whole thing like the
the magma punching through

3448
00:58:55,910 --> 00:58:55,920
the magma punching through
 

3449
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:58,230
the magma punching through
oh my gosh i see yes i'm sure it would

3450
00:58:58,230 --> 00:58:58,240
oh my gosh i see yes i'm sure it would
 

3451
00:58:58,240 --> 00:58:59,670
oh my gosh i see yes i'm sure it would
be beautiful and the pictures we've seen

3452
00:58:59,670 --> 00:58:59,680
be beautiful and the pictures we've seen
 

3453
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:00,549
be beautiful and the pictures we've seen
of it are beautiful

3454
00:59:00,549 --> 00:59:00,559
of it are beautiful
 

3455
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:03,510
of it are beautiful
you have so the the magma will come out

3456
00:59:03,510 --> 00:59:03,520
you have so the the magma will come out
 

3457
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:03,990
you have so the the magma will come out
of

3458
00:59:03,990 --> 00:59:04,000
of
 

3459
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,470
of
the lava will come out of these fissures

3460
00:59:06,470 --> 00:59:06,480
the lava will come out of these fissures
 

3461
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:07,430
the lava will come out of these fissures
and

3462
00:59:07,430 --> 00:59:07,440
and
 

3463
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:11,430
and
you have these curtains of lava that are

3464
00:59:11,430 --> 00:59:11,440
you have these curtains of lava that are
 

3465
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:13,750
you have these curtains of lava that are
maybe even a kilometer high so if you

3466
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:13,760
maybe even a kilometer high so if you
 

3467
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:14,870
maybe even a kilometer high so if you
looked at videos

3468
00:59:14,870 --> 00:59:14,880
looked at videos
 

3469
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:16,630
looked at videos
i don't know how many volcano videos

3470
00:59:16,630 --> 00:59:16,640
i don't know how many volcano videos
 

3471
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:17,750
i don't know how many volcano videos
you've looked at on earth but you

3472
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:17,760
you've looked at on earth but you
 

3473
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,670
you've looked at on earth but you
sometimes see a tiny tiny version of

3474
00:59:19,670 --> 00:59:19,680
sometimes see a tiny tiny version of
 

3475
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:21,109
sometimes see a tiny tiny version of
this in iceland you see just these

3476
00:59:21,109 --> 00:59:21,119
this in iceland you see just these
 

3477
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:23,349
this in iceland you see just these
sheets of magma coming out of a fissure

3478
00:59:23,349 --> 00:59:23,359
sheets of magma coming out of a fissure
 

3479
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:26,390
sheets of magma coming out of a fissure
when you have this really low viscosity

3480
00:59:26,390 --> 00:59:26,400
when you have this really low viscosity
 

3481
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:27,910
when you have this really low viscosity
magma sort of water-like

3482
00:59:27,910 --> 00:59:27,920
magma sort of water-like
 

3483
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:29,990
magma sort of water-like
coming out at these sheets and the

3484
00:59:29,990 --> 00:59:30,000
coming out at these sheets and the
 

3485
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,270
coming out at these sheets and the
plumes that come out

3486
00:59:31,270 --> 00:59:31,280
plumes that come out
 

3487
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:33,910
plumes that come out
because there's no atmosphere all the

3488
00:59:33,910 --> 00:59:33,920
because there's no atmosphere all the
 

3489
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:34,470
because there's no atmosphere all the
plume

3490
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:34,480
plume
 

3491
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:38,309
plume
molecules are just plume particles

3492
00:59:38,309 --> 00:59:38,319
molecules are just plume particles
 

3493
00:59:38,319 --> 00:59:40,630
molecules are just plume particles
where they end up is is just a function

3494
00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:40,640
where they end up is is just a function
 

3495
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:41,990
where they end up is is just a function
of the

3496
00:59:41,990 --> 00:59:42,000
of the
 

3497
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,750
of the
direction that they left the vent so

3498
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:43,760
direction that they left the vent so
 

3499
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:45,190
direction that they left the vent so
they're all following ballistic

3500
00:59:45,190 --> 00:59:45,200
they're all following ballistic
 

3501
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:46,390
they're all following ballistic
trajectories

3502
00:59:46,390 --> 00:59:46,400
trajectories
 

3503
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,309
trajectories
um and you end up with these umbrella

3504
00:59:48,309 --> 00:59:48,319
um and you end up with these umbrella
 

3505
00:59:48,319 --> 00:59:49,670
um and you end up with these umbrella
plumes you don't get these sort of

3506
00:59:49,670 --> 00:59:49,680
plumes you don't get these sort of
 

3507
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:51,190
plumes you don't get these sort of
complicated plumes that you have on

3508
00:59:51,190 --> 00:59:51,200
complicated plumes that you have on
 

3509
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:51,990
complicated plumes that you have on
earth

3510
00:59:51,990 --> 00:59:52,000
earth
 

3511
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,150
earth
that are occurring because of how that

3512
00:59:54,150 --> 00:59:54,160
that are occurring because of how that
 

3513
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:55,349
that are occurring because of how that
material is interacting with the

3514
00:59:55,349 --> 00:59:55,359
material is interacting with the
 

3515
00:59:55,359 --> 00:59:56,549
material is interacting with the
atmosphere that's there

3516
00:59:56,549 --> 00:59:56,559
atmosphere that's there
 

3517
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:58,549
atmosphere that's there
you just have these huge umbrellas and

3518
00:59:58,549 --> 00:59:58,559
you just have these huge umbrellas and
 

3519
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:00,710
you just have these huge umbrellas and
it's been hypothesized actually that

3520
01:00:00,710 --> 01:00:00,720
it's been hypothesized actually that
 

3521
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:03,109
it's been hypothesized actually that
the atmosphere is made of sulfur dioxide

3522
01:00:03,109 --> 01:00:03,119
the atmosphere is made of sulfur dioxide
 

3523
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:05,510
the atmosphere is made of sulfur dioxide
and

3524
01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:05,520

 

3525
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:06,950

that you could have these kind of ash

3526
01:00:06,950 --> 01:00:06,960
that you could have these kind of ash
 

3527
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:08,309
that you could have these kind of ash
particles from the volcano and the

3528
01:00:08,309 --> 01:00:08,319
particles from the volcano and the
 

3529
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:09,829
particles from the volcano and the
sulfur dioxide

3530
01:00:09,829 --> 01:00:09,839
sulfur dioxide
 

3531
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:13,030
sulfur dioxide
would condense onto these particles and

3532
01:00:13,030 --> 01:00:13,040
would condense onto these particles and
 

3533
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:15,190
would condense onto these particles and
you'd have sulfur dioxide snow coming

3534
01:00:15,190 --> 01:00:15,200
you'd have sulfur dioxide snow coming
 

3535
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:17,829
you'd have sulfur dioxide snow coming
out of these volcanic plumes

3536
01:00:17,829 --> 01:00:17,839
out of these volcanic plumes
 

3537
01:00:17,839 --> 01:00:20,630
out of these volcanic plumes
and uh there's not much light though

3538
01:00:20,630 --> 01:00:20,640
and uh there's not much light though
 

3539
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:21,190
and uh there's not much light though
right

3540
01:00:21,190 --> 01:00:21,200
right
 

3541
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:22,549
right
so you wouldn't be able to like it would

3542
01:00:22,549 --> 01:00:22,559
so you wouldn't be able to like it would
 

3543
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:23,910
so you wouldn't be able to like it would
make a good it would not make a good

3544
01:00:23,910 --> 01:00:23,920
make a good it would not make a good
 

3545
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:26,470
make a good it would not make a good
instagram photo because you have to

3546
01:00:26,470 --> 01:00:26,480
instagram photo because you have to
 

3547
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:29,510
instagram photo because you have to
would you see the snow sure there's

3548
01:00:29,510 --> 01:00:29,520
would you see the snow sure there's
 

3549
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:30,069
would you see the snow sure there's
light

3550
01:00:30,069 --> 01:00:30,079
light
 

3551
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:32,309
light
it depends okay so you could you could

3552
01:00:32,309 --> 01:00:32,319
it depends okay so you could you could
 

3553
01:00:32,319 --> 01:00:33,750
it depends okay so you could you could
still okay it depends what angle you're

3554
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:33,760
still okay it depends what angle you're
 

3555
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:35,510
still okay it depends what angle you're
looking at it where the sun is all the

3556
01:00:35,510 --> 01:00:35,520
looking at it where the sun is all the
 

3557
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:36,230
looking at it where the sun is all the
things like that

3558
01:00:36,230 --> 01:00:36,240
things like that
 

3559
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:37,829
things like that
you know the sunlight is much weaker but

3560
01:00:37,829 --> 01:00:37,839
you know the sunlight is much weaker but
 

3561
01:00:37,839 --> 01:00:40,789
you know the sunlight is much weaker but
it's still there it's still there

3562
01:00:40,789 --> 01:00:40,799
it's still there it's still there
 

3563
01:00:40,799 --> 01:00:43,829
it's still there it's still there
and uh how big is io in terms of gravity

3564
01:00:43,829 --> 01:00:43,839
and uh how big is io in terms of gravity
 

3565
01:00:43,839 --> 01:00:45,670
and uh how big is io in terms of gravity
is is it smaller is it a pretty small

3566
01:00:45,670 --> 01:00:45,680
is is it smaller is it a pretty small
 

3567
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:47,510
is is it smaller is it a pretty small
moon

3568
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:47,520
moon
 

3569
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:49,349
moon
it's quite a bit smaller than earth

3570
01:00:49,349 --> 01:00:49,359
it's quite a bit smaller than earth
 

3571
01:00:49,359 --> 01:00:51,750
it's quite a bit smaller than earth
anyway it's smaller than earth okay

3572
01:00:51,750 --> 01:00:51,760
anyway it's smaller than earth okay
 

3573
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:53,990
anyway it's smaller than earth okay
okay cool so they float out for a little

3574
01:00:53,990 --> 01:00:54,000
okay cool so they float out for a little
 

3575
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,069
okay cool so they float out for a little
bit so it floats well then yeah

3576
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:56,079
bit so it floats well then yeah
 

3577
01:00:56,079 --> 01:00:57,430
bit so it floats well then yeah
no you're right that would be that would

3578
01:00:57,430 --> 01:00:57,440
no you're right that would be that would
 

3579
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:59,190
no you're right that would be that would
be that'll be gorgeous

3580
01:00:59,190 --> 01:00:59,200
be that'll be gorgeous
 

3581
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:02,309
be that'll be gorgeous
um yeah what else about earth

3582
01:01:02,309 --> 01:01:02,319
um yeah what else about earth
 

3583
01:01:02,319 --> 01:01:03,990
um yeah what else about earth
is interesting besides volcanic so plate

3584
01:01:03,990 --> 01:01:04,000
is interesting besides volcanic so plate
 

3585
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,829
is interesting besides volcanic so plate
tectonics and i didn't realize that that

3586
01:01:05,829 --> 01:01:05,839
tectonics and i didn't realize that that
 

3587
01:01:05,839 --> 01:01:06,789
tectonics and i didn't realize that that
was the unique

3588
01:01:06,789 --> 01:01:06,799
was the unique
 

3589
01:01:06,799 --> 01:01:12,069
was the unique
element of a planet in the solar system

3590
01:01:12,069 --> 01:01:12,079

 

3591
01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:14,950

because that i wonder what i mean we

3592
01:01:14,950 --> 01:01:14,960
because that i wonder what i mean we
 

3593
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:16,630
because that i wonder what i mean we
experience it as human beings it's quite

3594
01:01:16,630 --> 01:01:16,640
experience it as human beings it's quite
 

3595
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:18,069
experience it as human beings it's quite
painful because of earthquakes and all

3596
01:01:18,069 --> 01:01:18,079
painful because of earthquakes and all
 

3597
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:19,589
painful because of earthquakes and all
those kinds of things but

3598
01:01:19,589 --> 01:01:19,599
those kinds of things but
 

3599
01:01:19,599 --> 01:01:22,710
those kinds of things but
i wonder if there's nice features to it

3600
01:01:22,710 --> 01:01:22,720
i wonder if there's nice features to it
 

3601
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:25,270
i wonder if there's nice features to it
yeah so coming back to habitability

3602
01:01:25,270 --> 01:01:25,280
yeah so coming back to habitability
 

3603
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:25,829
yeah so coming back to habitability
again

3604
01:01:25,829 --> 01:01:25,839
again
 

3605
01:01:25,839 --> 01:01:28,390
again
um things like tectonics and plate

3606
01:01:28,390 --> 01:01:28,400
um things like tectonics and plate
 

3607
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:29,190
um things like tectonics and plate
tectonics

3608
01:01:29,190 --> 01:01:29,200
tectonics
 

3609
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:31,190
tectonics
are are thought to play an important

3610
01:01:31,190 --> 01:01:31,200
are are thought to play an important
 

3611
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:33,109
are are thought to play an important
role in the surface being habitable and

3612
01:01:33,109 --> 01:01:33,119
role in the surface being habitable and
 

3613
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:34,470
role in the surface being habitable and
that's because

3614
01:01:34,470 --> 01:01:34,480
that's because
 

3615
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:37,589
that's because
you have a way of recycling material so

3616
01:01:37,589 --> 01:01:37,599
you have a way of recycling material so
 

3617
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:39,349
you have a way of recycling material so
if you have a stagnant surface

3618
01:01:39,349 --> 01:01:39,359
if you have a stagnant surface
 

3619
01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:40,950
if you have a stagnant surface
everything you know you use up all the

3620
01:01:40,950 --> 01:01:40,960
everything you know you use up all the
 

3621
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:42,950
everything you know you use up all the
free oxygen everything reacts until you

3622
01:01:42,950 --> 01:01:42,960
free oxygen everything reacts until you
 

3623
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:44,390
free oxygen everything reacts until you
no longer have

3624
01:01:44,390 --> 01:01:44,400
no longer have
 

3625
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:47,270
no longer have
reactants that life can extract energy

3626
01:01:47,270 --> 01:01:47,280
reactants that life can extract energy
 

3627
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:47,829
reactants that life can extract energy
from

3628
01:01:47,829 --> 01:01:47,839
from
 

3629
01:01:47,839 --> 01:01:49,190
from
and so if nothing's changing on your

3630
01:01:49,190 --> 01:01:49,200
and so if nothing's changing on your
 

3631
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:50,630
and so if nothing's changing on your
surface you kind of reach this

3632
01:01:50,630 --> 01:01:50,640
surface you kind of reach this
 

3633
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:52,309
surface you kind of reach this
stagnation point

3634
01:01:52,309 --> 01:01:52,319
stagnation point
 

3635
01:01:52,319 --> 01:01:55,910
stagnation point
um but something like plate tectonics

3636
01:01:55,910 --> 01:01:55,920
um but something like plate tectonics
 

3637
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:58,230
um but something like plate tectonics
recycles material you bring up new fresh

3638
01:01:58,230 --> 01:01:58,240
recycles material you bring up new fresh
 

3639
01:01:58,240 --> 01:01:59,829
recycles material you bring up new fresh
material from the interior you bring

3640
01:01:59,829 --> 01:01:59,839
material from the interior you bring
 

3641
01:01:59,839 --> 01:02:00,630
material from the interior you bring
down

3642
01:02:00,630 --> 01:02:00,640
down
 

3643
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:02,789
down
material that's up on the surface and

3644
01:02:02,789 --> 01:02:02,799
material that's up on the surface and
 

3645
01:02:02,799 --> 01:02:03,829
material that's up on the surface and
and that can

3646
01:02:03,829 --> 01:02:03,839
and that can
 

3647
01:02:03,839 --> 01:02:06,230
and that can
kind of refresh your your nutrient

3648
01:02:06,230 --> 01:02:06,240
kind of refresh your your nutrient
 

3649
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:08,390
kind of refresh your your nutrient
supply in a sense or the the sort of raw

3650
01:02:08,390 --> 01:02:08,400
supply in a sense or the the sort of raw
 

3651
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,630
supply in a sense or the the sort of raw
materials that the surface has to work

3652
01:02:10,630 --> 01:02:10,640
materials that the surface has to work
 

3653
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:11,829
materials that the surface has to work
with

3654
01:02:11,829 --> 01:02:11,839
with
 

3655
01:02:11,839 --> 01:02:16,230
with
so um from a kind of astrobiologist's

3656
01:02:16,230 --> 01:02:16,240
so um from a kind of astrobiologist's
 

3657
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:17,910
so um from a kind of astrobiologist's
perspective looking at earth you would

3658
01:02:17,910 --> 01:02:17,920
perspective looking at earth you would
 

3659
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:18,710
perspective looking at earth you would
see

3660
01:02:18,710 --> 01:02:18,720
see
 

3661
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:20,549
see
that recycling of material because the

3662
01:02:20,549 --> 01:02:20,559
that recycling of material because the
 

3663
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:22,710
that recycling of material because the
plate tectonics you would also see

3664
01:02:22,710 --> 01:02:22,720
plate tectonics you would also see
 

3665
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:24,950
plate tectonics you would also see
how much oxygen is in earth's atmosphere

3666
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:24,960
how much oxygen is in earth's atmosphere
 

3667
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:26,630
how much oxygen is in earth's atmosphere
and between those two things you would

3668
01:02:26,630 --> 01:02:26,640
and between those two things you would
 

3669
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:28,470
and between those two things you would
identify earth as a

3670
01:02:28,470 --> 01:02:28,480
identify earth as a
 

3671
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,870
identify earth as a
reasonable candidate for a habitable

3672
01:02:30,870 --> 01:02:30,880
reasonable candidate for a habitable
 

3673
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:31,910
reasonable candidate for a habitable
environment

3674
01:02:31,910 --> 01:02:31,920
environment
 

3675
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:33,910
environment
in addition to of course the you know

3676
01:02:33,910 --> 01:02:33,920
in addition to of course the you know
 

3677
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:36,069
in addition to of course the you know
pleasant temperature and liquid water

3678
01:02:36,069 --> 01:02:36,079
pleasant temperature and liquid water
 

3679
01:02:36,079 --> 01:02:38,789
pleasant temperature and liquid water
um but the abundance of oxygen and the

3680
01:02:38,789 --> 01:02:38,799
um but the abundance of oxygen and the
 

3681
01:02:38,799 --> 01:02:40,230
um but the abundance of oxygen and the
the plate tectonics both

3682
01:02:40,230 --> 01:02:40,240
the plate tectonics both
 

3683
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:42,789
the plate tectonics both
play a role as well and also see like

3684
01:02:42,789 --> 01:02:42,799
play a role as well and also see like
 

3685
01:02:42,799 --> 01:02:44,870
play a role as well and also see like
tiny dot satellites flying around

3686
01:02:44,870 --> 01:02:44,880
tiny dot satellites flying around
 

3687
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:47,510
tiny dot satellites flying around
well sure yes i wonder if they would be

3688
01:02:47,510 --> 01:02:47,520
well sure yes i wonder if they would be
 

3689
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:49,109
well sure yes i wonder if they would be
able to i really think about that like

3690
01:02:49,109 --> 01:02:49,119
able to i really think about that like
 

3691
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:50,870
able to i really think about that like
if they if aliens were to

3692
01:02:50,870 --> 01:02:50,880
if they if aliens were to
 

3693
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:54,789
if they if aliens were to
visit and would they really see humans

3694
01:02:54,789 --> 01:02:54,799
visit and would they really see humans
 

3695
01:02:54,799 --> 01:02:57,829
visit and would they really see humans
as the thing they should be focusing on

3696
01:02:57,829 --> 01:02:57,839
as the thing they should be focusing on
 

3697
01:02:57,839 --> 01:03:00,950
as the thing they should be focusing on
i think it would take a while right

3698
01:03:00,950 --> 01:03:00,960
i think it would take a while right
 

3699
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:03,829
i think it would take a while right
because it's so obvious that that should

3700
01:03:03,829 --> 01:03:03,839
because it's so obvious that that should
 

3701
01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:05,829
because it's so obvious that that should
because there's like so much incredible

3702
01:03:05,829 --> 01:03:05,839
because there's like so much incredible
 

3703
01:03:05,839 --> 01:03:08,230
because there's like so much incredible
in terms of biomass humans are a tiny

3704
01:03:08,230 --> 01:03:08,240
in terms of biomass humans are a tiny
 

3705
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:09,910
in terms of biomass humans are a tiny
tiny tiny fraction

3706
01:03:09,910 --> 01:03:09,920
tiny tiny fraction
 

3707
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:12,549
tiny tiny fraction
there's like ants they would probably

3708
01:03:12,549 --> 01:03:12,559
there's like ants they would probably
 

3709
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:14,549
there's like ants they would probably
detect ants

3710
01:03:14,549 --> 01:03:14,559
detect ants
 

3711
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:15,990
detect ants
right or they probably would focus on

3712
01:03:15,990 --> 01:03:16,000
right or they probably would focus on
 

3713
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,750
right or they probably would focus on
the water and the fish

3714
01:03:17,750 --> 01:03:17,760
the water and the fish
 

3715
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:19,910
the water and the fish
because there's like a lot of water i

3716
01:03:19,910 --> 01:03:19,920
because there's like a lot of water i
 

3717
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:21,270
because there's like a lot of water i
don't i was surprised to learn that

3718
01:03:21,270 --> 01:03:21,280
don't i was surprised to learn that
 

3719
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:22,549
don't i was surprised to learn that
there's more species

3720
01:03:22,549 --> 01:03:22,559
there's more species
 

3721
01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:25,109
there's more species
on land than there is in the sea like

3722
01:03:25,109 --> 01:03:25,119
on land than there is in the sea like
 

3723
01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:25,990
on land than there is in the sea like
there's 90

3724
01:03:25,990 --> 01:03:26,000
there's 90
 

3725
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,309
there's 90
i think 90 to 95 percent of the species

3726
01:03:28,309 --> 01:03:28,319
i think 90 to 95 percent of the species
 

3727
01:03:28,319 --> 01:03:29,349
i think 90 to 95 percent of the species
are on

3728
01:03:29,349 --> 01:03:29,359
are on
 

3729
01:03:29,359 --> 01:03:31,670
are on
or on land on land not in the sea not in

3730
01:03:31,670 --> 01:03:31,680
or on land on land not in the sea not in
 

3731
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:32,549
or on land on land not in the sea not in
the sea

3732
01:03:32,549 --> 01:03:32,559
the sea
 

3733
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:34,150
the sea
i i thought like there's so much going

3734
01:03:34,150 --> 01:03:34,160
i i thought like there's so much going
 

3735
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:36,230
i i thought like there's so much going
on in the sea but no the

3736
01:03:36,230 --> 01:03:36,240
on in the sea but no the
 

3737
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:38,309
on in the sea but no the
the variety that like the branches

3738
01:03:38,309 --> 01:03:38,319
the variety that like the branches
 

3739
01:03:38,319 --> 01:03:39,750
the variety that like the branches
created by evolution

3740
01:03:39,750 --> 01:03:39,760
created by evolution
 

3741
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:42,150
created by evolution
apparently it's probably a good answer

3742
01:03:42,150 --> 01:03:42,160
apparently it's probably a good answer
 

3743
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:43,829
apparently it's probably a good answer
from evolutionary biology perspective

3744
01:03:43,829 --> 01:03:43,839
from evolutionary biology perspective
 

3745
01:03:43,839 --> 01:03:44,150
from evolutionary biology perspective
why

3746
01:03:44,150 --> 01:03:44,160
why
 

3747
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:45,990
why
land created so much diversity but it

3748
01:03:45,990 --> 01:03:46,000
land created so much diversity but it
 

3749
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,910
land created so much diversity but it
did so like the sea

3750
01:03:47,910 --> 01:03:47,920
did so like the sea
 

3751
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:50,630
did so like the sea
there's so much not known about the sea

3752
01:03:50,630 --> 01:03:50,640
there's so much not known about the sea
 

3753
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:53,349
there's so much not known about the sea
about the oceans but

3754
01:03:53,349 --> 01:03:53,359
about the oceans but
 

3755
01:03:53,359 --> 01:03:57,190
about the oceans but
it's not um it's not diversity friendly

3756
01:03:57,190 --> 01:03:57,200
it's not um it's not diversity friendly
 

3757
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:59,829
it's not um it's not diversity friendly
what can i say he's uh it needs to he

3758
01:03:59,829 --> 01:03:59,839
what can i say he's uh it needs to he
 

3759
01:03:59,839 --> 01:04:01,270
what can i say he's uh it needs to he
needs to improve his diversity

3760
01:04:01,270 --> 01:04:01,280
needs to improve his diversity
 

3761
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:02,710
needs to improve his diversity
what can you do do you think the aliens

3762
01:04:02,710 --> 01:04:02,720
what can you do do you think the aliens
 

3763
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:03,910
what can you do do you think the aliens
would come i mean the first thing they

3764
01:04:03,910 --> 01:04:03,920
would come i mean the first thing they
 

3765
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:04,549
would come i mean the first thing they
would see is

3766
01:04:04,549 --> 01:04:04,559
would see is
 

3767
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:06,470
would see is
i suppose our cities assuming that they

3768
01:04:06,470 --> 01:04:06,480
i suppose our cities assuming that they
 

3769
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:09,270
i suppose our cities assuming that they
had some idea of what a natural world

3770
01:04:09,270 --> 01:04:09,280
had some idea of what a natural world
 

3771
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:11,990
had some idea of what a natural world
looked like they would see cities and

3772
01:04:11,990 --> 01:04:12,000
looked like they would see cities and
 

3773
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,270
looked like they would see cities and
say these don't belong

3774
01:04:13,270 --> 01:04:13,280
say these don't belong
 

3775
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:15,190
say these don't belong
which of these many species created

3776
01:04:15,190 --> 01:04:15,200
which of these many species created
 

3777
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:17,109
which of these many species created
these yeah i mean there's

3778
01:04:17,109 --> 01:04:17,119
these yeah i mean there's
 

3779
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:20,549
these yeah i mean there's
i if i were to guess it would

3780
01:04:20,549 --> 01:04:20,559
i if i were to guess it would
 

3781
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:23,190
i if i were to guess it would
it's a good question i don't know if you

3782
01:04:23,190 --> 01:04:23,200
it's a good question i don't know if you
 

3783
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:24,870
it's a good question i don't know if you
do this when you look at the telescope

3784
01:04:24,870 --> 01:04:24,880
do this when you look at the telescope
 

3785
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:25,990
do this when you look at the telescope
whether you look at

3786
01:04:25,990 --> 01:04:26,000
whether you look at
 

3787
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:29,910
whether you look at
uh geometric shapes like

3788
01:04:29,910 --> 01:04:29,920
uh geometric shapes like
 

3789
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:33,029
uh geometric shapes like
if it's uh good because to me like

3790
01:04:33,029 --> 01:04:33,039
if it's uh good because to me like
 

3791
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:35,750
if it's uh good because to me like
hard corners like what do we think is

3792
01:04:35,750 --> 01:04:35,760
hard corners like what do we think is
 

3793
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:37,829
hard corners like what do we think is
engineered

3794
01:04:37,829 --> 01:04:37,839
engineered
 

3795
01:04:37,839 --> 01:04:39,589
engineered
things that are like have kind of

3796
01:04:39,589 --> 01:04:39,599
things that are like have kind of
 

3797
01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:41,750
things that are like have kind of
straight lines and corners and so on

3798
01:04:41,750 --> 01:04:41,760
straight lines and corners and so on
 

3799
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:43,430
straight lines and corners and so on
they will probably detect those in terms

3800
01:04:43,430 --> 01:04:43,440
they will probably detect those in terms
 

3801
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:45,430
they will probably detect those in terms
of buildings would stand out to them

3802
01:04:45,430 --> 01:04:45,440
of buildings would stand out to them
 

3803
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:47,589
of buildings would stand out to them
because that's that goes against the

3804
01:04:47,589 --> 01:04:47,599
because that's that goes against the
 

3805
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:49,190
because that's that goes against the
basic natural

3806
01:04:49,190 --> 01:04:49,200
basic natural
 

3807
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:53,990
basic natural
physics of the world but

3808
01:04:53,990 --> 01:04:54,000
physics of the world but
 

3809
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,670
physics of the world but
i don't know if the electricity and

3810
01:04:55,670 --> 01:04:55,680
i don't know if the electricity and
 

3811
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:57,589
i don't know if the electricity and
lights and so on it could be i

3812
01:04:57,589 --> 01:04:57,599
lights and so on it could be i
 

3813
01:04:57,599 --> 01:05:01,029
lights and so on it could be i
honestly it could be the plate tectonics

3814
01:05:01,029 --> 01:05:01,039
honestly it could be the plate tectonics
 

3815
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:03,430
honestly it could be the plate tectonics
it could be like that uh the like the

3816
01:05:03,430 --> 01:05:03,440
it could be like that uh the like the
 

3817
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:05,029
it could be like that uh the like the
volcanoes that'd be okay that's the

3818
01:05:05,029 --> 01:05:05,039
volcanoes that'd be okay that's the
 

3819
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:07,029
volcanoes that'd be okay that's the
source of heat and then they would focus

3820
01:05:07,029 --> 01:05:07,039
source of heat and then they would focus
 

3821
01:05:07,039 --> 01:05:09,510
source of heat and then they would focus
they might literally i mean depending on

3822
01:05:09,510 --> 01:05:09,520
they might literally i mean depending on
 

3823
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:11,270
they might literally i mean depending on
how alien life forms are

3824
01:05:11,270 --> 01:05:11,280
how alien life forms are
 

3825
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:14,549
how alien life forms are
they might notice the microorganisms

3826
01:05:14,549 --> 01:05:14,559
they might notice the microorganisms
 

3827
01:05:14,559 --> 01:05:17,589
they might notice the microorganisms
before they notice the big like notice

3828
01:05:17,589 --> 01:05:17,599
before they notice the big like notice
 

3829
01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:19,990
before they notice the big like notice
the ant before the elephant

3830
01:05:19,990 --> 01:05:20,000
the ant before the elephant
 

3831
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,549
the ant before the elephant
because like there's a lot more of them

3832
01:05:22,549 --> 01:05:22,559
because like there's a lot more of them
 

3833
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:23,990
because like there's a lot more of them
depending what they're measuring device

3834
01:05:23,990 --> 01:05:24,000
depending what they're measuring device
 

3835
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,630
depending what they're measuring device
we think like size matters but maybe

3836
01:05:26,630 --> 01:05:26,640
we think like size matters but maybe
 

3837
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:28,789
we think like size matters but maybe
with their tools of measurement they

3838
01:05:28,789 --> 01:05:28,799
with their tools of measurement they
 

3839
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:29,990
with their tools of measurement they
would look for

3840
01:05:29,990 --> 01:05:30,000
would look for
 

3841
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,029
would look for
quantity versus size like why focus on

3842
01:05:33,029 --> 01:05:33,039
quantity versus size like why focus on
 

3843
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:34,470
quantity versus size like why focus on
the big thing

3844
01:05:34,470 --> 01:05:34,480
the big thing
 

3845
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:36,710
the big thing
focus on the thing that there's a lot of

3846
01:05:36,710 --> 01:05:36,720
focus on the thing that there's a lot of
 

3847
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:38,309
focus on the thing that there's a lot of
and when they see humans depending on

3848
01:05:38,309 --> 01:05:38,319
and when they see humans depending on
 

3849
01:05:38,319 --> 01:05:40,390
and when they see humans depending on
their measurement devices they might see

3850
01:05:40,390 --> 01:05:40,400
their measurement devices they might see
 

3851
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:43,510
their measurement devices they might see
we're made up of billions of organisms

3852
01:05:43,510 --> 01:05:43,520
we're made up of billions of organisms
 

3853
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:45,589
we're made up of billions of organisms
like the fact that we have we're very

3854
01:05:45,589 --> 01:05:45,599
like the fact that we have we're very
 

3855
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:46,630
like the fact that we have we're very
human centered we think

3856
01:05:46,630 --> 01:05:46,640
human centered we think
 

3857
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:49,029
human centered we think
we're one organism but that may not be

3858
01:05:49,029 --> 01:05:49,039
we're one organism but that may not be
 

3859
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:49,750
we're one organism but that may not be
the case

3860
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:49,760
the case
 

3861
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:51,430
the case
they might see in fact they might also

3862
01:05:51,430 --> 01:05:51,440
they might see in fact they might also
 

3863
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:54,150
they might see in fact they might also
see like a human city

3864
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:54,160
see like a human city
 

3865
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:57,670
see like a human city
as one organism like what is this thing

3866
01:05:57,670 --> 01:05:57,680
as one organism like what is this thing
 

3867
01:05:57,680 --> 01:05:58,950
as one organism like what is this thing
that like

3868
01:05:58,950 --> 01:05:58,960
that like
 

3869
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:02,309
that like
clearly this organism gets um

3870
01:06:02,309 --> 01:06:02,319
clearly this organism gets um
 

3871
01:06:02,319 --> 01:06:04,470
clearly this organism gets um
aroused at night because the lights go

3872
01:06:04,470 --> 01:06:04,480
aroused at night because the lights go
 

3873
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:05,990
aroused at night because the lights go
on

3874
01:06:05,990 --> 01:06:06,000
on
 

3875
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,190
on
and then uh and then it like it sleeps

3876
01:06:09,190 --> 01:06:09,200
and then uh and then it like it sleeps
 

3877
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:11,349
and then uh and then it like it sleeps
during the day

3878
01:06:11,349 --> 01:06:11,359
during the day
 

3879
01:06:11,359 --> 01:06:13,910
during the day
i don't know how like what perspective

3880
01:06:13,910 --> 01:06:13,920
i don't know how like what perspective
 

3881
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:16,150
i don't know how like what perspective
you take on the city

3882
01:06:16,150 --> 01:06:16,160
you take on the city
 

3883
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:17,990
you take on the city
is there something interesting about

3884
01:06:17,990 --> 01:06:18,000
is there something interesting about
 

3885
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,589
is there something interesting about
earth or other planets in terms of

3886
01:06:19,589 --> 01:06:19,599
earth or other planets in terms of
 

3887
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:20,630
earth or other planets in terms of
weather patterns

3888
01:06:20,630 --> 01:06:20,640
weather patterns
 

3889
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:24,789
weather patterns
so we talked a lot about volcanic

3890
01:06:24,789 --> 01:06:24,799
so we talked a lot about volcanic
 

3891
01:06:24,799 --> 01:06:27,589
so we talked a lot about volcanic
patterns is there something else about

3892
01:06:27,589 --> 01:06:27,599
patterns is there something else about
 

3893
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:29,109
patterns is there something else about
weather

3894
01:06:29,109 --> 01:06:29,119
weather
 

3895
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:32,150
weather
that's interesting like storms or

3896
01:06:32,150 --> 01:06:32,160
that's interesting like storms or
 

3897
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:34,309
that's interesting like storms or
variations in temperature

3898
01:06:34,309 --> 01:06:34,319
variations in temperature
 

3899
01:06:34,319 --> 01:06:37,990
variations in temperature
all those kinds of things

3900
01:06:37,990 --> 01:06:38,000

 

3901
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:41,029

yeah so there's sort of every

3902
01:06:41,029 --> 01:06:41,039
yeah so there's sort of every
 

3903
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:42,549
yeah so there's sort of every
planet and moon has a kind of

3904
01:06:42,549 --> 01:06:42,559
planet and moon has a kind of
 

3905
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:44,829
planet and moon has a kind of
interesting and unique weather pattern

3906
01:06:44,829 --> 01:06:44,839
interesting and unique weather pattern
 

3907
01:06:44,839 --> 01:06:48,390
interesting and unique weather pattern
and those weather patterns are really

3908
01:06:48,390 --> 01:06:48,400
and those weather patterns are really
 

3909
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:50,470
and those weather patterns are really
we don't have a good understanding of

3910
01:06:50,470 --> 01:06:50,480
we don't have a good understanding of
 

3911
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:51,510
we don't have a good understanding of
them we don't even have a good

3912
01:06:51,510 --> 01:06:51,520
them we don't even have a good
 

3913
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:52,630
them we don't even have a good
understanding of the

3914
01:06:52,630 --> 01:06:52,640
understanding of the
 

3915
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:55,910
understanding of the
the global circulation patterns

3916
01:06:55,910 --> 01:06:55,920
the global circulation patterns
 

3917
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:59,029
the global circulation patterns
of many of these atmospheres why the

3918
01:06:59,029 --> 01:06:59,039
of many of these atmospheres why the
 

3919
01:06:59,039 --> 01:07:00,390
of many of these atmospheres why the
storm systems occur

3920
01:07:00,390 --> 01:07:00,400
storm systems occur
 

3921
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:04,390
storm systems occur
so the the

3922
01:07:04,390 --> 01:07:04,400
so the the
 

3923
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:06,630
so the the
composition and occurrence of storms and

3924
01:07:06,630 --> 01:07:06,640
composition and occurrence of storms and
 

3925
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:08,710
composition and occurrence of storms and
clouds and these objects is another one

3926
01:07:08,710 --> 01:07:08,720
clouds and these objects is another one
 

3927
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:09,990
clouds and these objects is another one
of these

3928
01:07:09,990 --> 01:07:10,000
of these
 

3929
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,990
of these
kind of windows into the interior that i

3930
01:07:11,990 --> 01:07:12,000
kind of windows into the interior that i
 

3931
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,829
kind of windows into the interior that i
was talking about with surfaces one of

3932
01:07:13,829 --> 01:07:13,839
was talking about with surfaces one of
 

3933
01:07:13,839 --> 01:07:15,029
was talking about with surfaces one of
these

3934
01:07:15,029 --> 01:07:15,039
these
 

3935
01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:16,470
these
ways that we can get perspective and

3936
01:07:16,470 --> 01:07:16,480
ways that we can get perspective and
 

3937
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:18,390
ways that we can get perspective and
what the composition is of the interior

3938
01:07:18,390 --> 01:07:18,400
what the composition is of the interior
 

3939
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:18,630
what the composition is of the interior
and

3940
01:07:18,630 --> 01:07:18,640
and
 

3941
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:20,390
and
how the circulation is working so

3942
01:07:20,390 --> 01:07:20,400
how the circulation is working so
 

3943
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:22,150
how the circulation is working so
circulation will

3944
01:07:22,150 --> 01:07:22,160
circulation will
 

3945
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:25,510
circulation will
bring some species up from deeper in the

3946
01:07:25,510 --> 01:07:25,520
bring some species up from deeper in the
 

3947
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:27,190
bring some species up from deeper in the
atmosphere of the planet to some

3948
01:07:27,190 --> 01:07:27,200
atmosphere of the planet to some
 

3949
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:28,789
atmosphere of the planet to some
altitude that's a little bit colder and

3950
01:07:28,789 --> 01:07:28,799
altitude that's a little bit colder and
 

3951
01:07:28,799 --> 01:07:30,630
altitude that's a little bit colder and
that species will condense out and form

3952
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:30,640
that species will condense out and form
 

3953
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:32,390
that species will condense out and form
a cloud at that altitude

3954
01:07:32,390 --> 01:07:32,400
a cloud at that altitude
 

3955
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:35,589
a cloud at that altitude
and we can detect in some cases what

3956
01:07:35,589 --> 01:07:35,599
and we can detect in some cases what
 

3957
01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:38,789
and we can detect in some cases what
those clouds are composed of

3958
01:07:38,789 --> 01:07:38,799
those clouds are composed of
 

3959
01:07:38,799 --> 01:07:42,870
those clouds are composed of
and looking at where those occur

3960
01:07:42,870 --> 01:07:42,880
and looking at where those occur
 

3961
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:45,349
and looking at where those occur
can tell you how the circulation cells

3962
01:07:45,349 --> 01:07:45,359
can tell you how the circulation cells
 

3963
01:07:45,359 --> 01:07:46,150
can tell you how the circulation cells
are whether

3964
01:07:46,150 --> 01:07:46,160
are whether
 

3965
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:47,990
are whether
the atmospheric circulation is say

3966
01:07:47,990 --> 01:07:48,000
the atmospheric circulation is say
 

3967
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,829
the atmospheric circulation is say
coming up at the equator and going down

3968
01:07:49,829 --> 01:07:49,839
coming up at the equator and going down
 

3969
01:07:49,839 --> 01:07:50,789
coming up at the equator and going down
at the poles

3970
01:07:50,789 --> 01:07:50,799
at the poles
 

3971
01:07:50,799 --> 01:07:52,309
at the poles
or whether you have multiple cells in

3972
01:07:52,309 --> 01:07:52,319
or whether you have multiple cells in
 

3973
01:07:52,319 --> 01:07:53,910
or whether you have multiple cells in
the atmosphere and

3974
01:07:53,910 --> 01:07:53,920
the atmosphere and
 

3975
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:56,950
the atmosphere and
i mean jupiter's atmosphere is is

3976
01:07:56,950 --> 01:07:56,960
i mean jupiter's atmosphere is is
 

3977
01:07:56,960 --> 01:07:58,870
i mean jupiter's atmosphere is is
just insane there's so much going on you

3978
01:07:58,870 --> 01:07:58,880
just insane there's so much going on you
 

3979
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:00,309
just insane there's so much going on you
look at these pictures and there's all

3980
01:08:00,309 --> 01:08:00,319
look at these pictures and there's all
 

3981
01:08:00,319 --> 01:08:02,630
look at these pictures and there's all
these vortices and anti-vortices and you

3982
01:08:02,630 --> 01:08:02,640
these vortices and anti-vortices and you
 

3983
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:04,150
these vortices and anti-vortices and you
have these different bands that are

3984
01:08:04,150 --> 01:08:04,160
have these different bands that are
 

3985
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:05,109
have these different bands that are
moving in

3986
01:08:05,109 --> 01:08:05,119
moving in
 

3987
01:08:05,119 --> 01:08:07,670
moving in
in opposite directions that may be

3988
01:08:07,670 --> 01:08:07,680
in opposite directions that may be
 

3989
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:08,549
in opposite directions that may be
giving you

3990
01:08:08,549 --> 01:08:08,559
giving you
 

3991
01:08:08,559 --> 01:08:11,990
giving you
information about the the deep

3992
01:08:11,990 --> 01:08:12,000
information about the the deep
 

3993
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,470
information about the the deep
proper like deep in the atmosphere um

3994
01:08:14,470 --> 01:08:14,480
proper like deep in the atmosphere um
 

3995
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:16,070
proper like deep in the atmosphere um
physically deep properties

3996
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:16,080
physically deep properties
 

3997
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:19,110
physically deep properties
of um jupiter's

3998
01:08:19,110 --> 01:08:19,120
of um jupiter's
 

3999
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:22,550
of um jupiter's
interior and in circulation

4000
01:08:22,550 --> 01:08:22,560
interior and in circulation
 

4001
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:24,870
interior and in circulation
what are the these vortices wha what's

4002
01:08:24,870 --> 01:08:24,880
what are the these vortices wha what's
 

4003
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:27,590
what are the these vortices wha what's
the basic material of the storms

4004
01:08:27,590 --> 01:08:27,600
the basic material of the storms
 

4005
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:29,430
the basic material of the storms
it's condensed molecules from the

4006
01:08:29,430 --> 01:08:29,440
it's condensed molecules from the
 

4007
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:31,749
it's condensed molecules from the
atmosphere so ammonia ice particles

4008
01:08:31,749 --> 01:08:31,759
atmosphere so ammonia ice particles
 

4009
01:08:31,759 --> 01:08:34,309
atmosphere so ammonia ice particles
um in the case of jupiter it's methane

4010
01:08:34,309 --> 01:08:34,319
um in the case of jupiter it's methane
 

4011
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:35,990
um in the case of jupiter it's methane
ice in the case of let's say

4012
01:08:35,990 --> 01:08:36,000
ice in the case of let's say
 

4013
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,309
ice in the case of let's say
uranus and neptune and other species you

4014
01:08:38,309 --> 01:08:38,319
uranus and neptune and other species you
 

4015
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:39,910
uranus and neptune and other species you
can kind of construct

4016
01:08:39,910 --> 01:08:39,920
can kind of construct
 

4017
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:41,829
can kind of construct
a chemical model for which species can

4018
01:08:41,829 --> 01:08:41,839
a chemical model for which species can
 

4019
01:08:41,839 --> 01:08:43,990
a chemical model for which species can
condense where and so you see a cloud at

4020
01:08:43,990 --> 01:08:44,000
condense where and so you see a cloud at
 

4021
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:44,870
condense where and so you see a cloud at
a certain

4022
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:44,880
a certain
 

4023
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:46,470
a certain
altitude within the atmosphere and you

4024
01:08:46,470 --> 01:08:46,480
altitude within the atmosphere and you
 

4025
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:48,070
altitude within the atmosphere and you
can make a guess at what that cloud is

4026
01:08:48,070 --> 01:08:48,080
can make a guess at what that cloud is
 

4027
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:48,870
can make a guess at what that cloud is
made of

4028
01:08:48,870 --> 01:08:48,880
made of
 

4029
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:50,789
made of
and sometimes measure it directly and

4030
01:08:50,789 --> 01:08:50,799
and sometimes measure it directly and
 

4031
01:08:50,799 --> 01:08:52,070
and sometimes measure it directly and
you know different species make

4032
01:08:52,070 --> 01:08:52,080
you know different species make
 

4033
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:53,910
you know different species make
different colors as well

4034
01:08:53,910 --> 01:08:53,920
different colors as well
 

4035
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:57,110
different colors as well
oh cool ice storms okay

4036
01:08:57,110 --> 01:08:57,120
oh cool ice storms okay
 

4037
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:59,189
oh cool ice storms okay
i mean the climate of uranus has always

4038
01:08:59,189 --> 01:08:59,199
i mean the climate of uranus has always
 

4039
01:08:59,199 --> 01:09:01,269
i mean the climate of uranus has always
been fascinating to me because

4040
01:09:01,269 --> 01:09:01,279
been fascinating to me because
 

4041
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:04,829
been fascinating to me because
it orbits on its side and it has a

4042
01:09:04,829 --> 01:09:04,839
it orbits on its side and it has a
 

4043
01:09:04,839 --> 01:09:07,910
it orbits on its side and it has a
42-year orbital period and so

4044
01:09:07,910 --> 01:09:07,920
42-year orbital period and so
 

4045
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:09,510
42-year orbital period and so
you know with earth our seasons are

4046
01:09:09,510 --> 01:09:09,520
you know with earth our seasons are
 

4047
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:11,349
you know with earth our seasons are
because our equator is tipped just a

4048
01:09:11,349 --> 01:09:11,359
because our equator is tipped just a
 

4049
01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:13,030
because our equator is tipped just a
little bit to the plane that we orbit in

4050
01:09:13,030 --> 01:09:13,040
little bit to the plane that we orbit in
 

4051
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:14,550
little bit to the plane that we orbit in
so sometimes the sun lights a little bit

4052
01:09:14,550 --> 01:09:14,560
so sometimes the sun lights a little bit
 

4053
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:15,829
so sometimes the sun lights a little bit
above the equator and sometimes it's a

4054
01:09:15,829 --> 01:09:15,839
above the equator and sometimes it's a
 

4055
01:09:15,839 --> 01:09:17,189
above the equator and sometimes it's a
little bit below the equator

4056
01:09:17,189 --> 01:09:17,199
little bit below the equator
 

4057
01:09:17,199 --> 01:09:20,789
little bit below the equator
but on uranus it's like for for 10 years

4058
01:09:20,789 --> 01:09:20,799
but on uranus it's like for for 10 years
 

4059
01:09:20,799 --> 01:09:22,470
but on uranus it's like for for 10 years
the sunlight is directly on the north

4060
01:09:22,470 --> 01:09:22,480
the sunlight is directly on the north
 

4061
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:23,829
the sunlight is directly on the north
pole and then it's directly on the

4062
01:09:23,829 --> 01:09:23,839
pole and then it's directly on the
 

4063
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:25,269
pole and then it's directly on the
equator and then it's directly on the

4064
01:09:25,269 --> 01:09:25,279
equator and then it's directly on the
 

4065
01:09:25,279 --> 01:09:26,470
equator and then it's directly on the
south pole

4066
01:09:26,470 --> 01:09:26,480
south pole
 

4067
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:29,110
south pole
and it's it's actually kind of amazing

4068
01:09:29,110 --> 01:09:29,120
and it's it's actually kind of amazing
 

4069
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:31,110
and it's it's actually kind of amazing
that the atmosphere doesn't look crazier

4070
01:09:31,110 --> 01:09:31,120
that the atmosphere doesn't look crazier
 

4071
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:31,910
that the atmosphere doesn't look crazier
than

4072
01:09:31,910 --> 01:09:31,920
than
 

4073
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:35,189
than
it does but understanding how taking

4074
01:09:35,189 --> 01:09:35,199
it does but understanding how taking
 

4075
01:09:35,199 --> 01:09:37,269
it does but understanding how taking
again like one of these extreme examples

4076
01:09:37,269 --> 01:09:37,279
again like one of these extreme examples
 

4077
01:09:37,279 --> 01:09:38,470
again like one of these extreme examples
if we can understand

4078
01:09:38,470 --> 01:09:38,480
if we can understand
 

4079
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:40,550
if we can understand
why that atmosphere behaves in the way

4080
01:09:40,550 --> 01:09:40,560
why that atmosphere behaves in the way
 

4081
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:41,510
why that atmosphere behaves in the way
it does

4082
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:41,520
it does
 

4083
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:43,030
it does
it's kind of a test of our our

4084
01:09:43,030 --> 01:09:43,040
it's kind of a test of our our
 

4085
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:44,870
it's kind of a test of our our
understanding of how

4086
01:09:44,870 --> 01:09:44,880
understanding of how
 

4087
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:47,669
understanding of how
how atmospheres so like heats up one

4088
01:09:47,669 --> 01:09:47,679
how atmospheres so like heats up one
 

4089
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:47,990
how atmospheres so like heats up one
side

4090
01:09:47,990 --> 01:09:48,000
side
 

4091
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,269
side
of the planet for 10 years and then

4092
01:09:51,269 --> 01:09:51,279
of the planet for 10 years and then
 

4093
01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:55,270
of the planet for 10 years and then
freezes it the next like

4094
01:09:55,270 --> 01:09:55,280
freezes it the next like
 

4095
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:57,270
freezes it the next like
and that you're saying would should

4096
01:09:57,270 --> 01:09:57,280
and that you're saying would should
 

4097
01:09:57,280 --> 01:10:00,229
and that you're saying would should
probably lead to some chaos

4098
01:10:00,229 --> 01:10:00,239
probably lead to some chaos
 

4099
01:10:00,239 --> 01:10:02,709
probably lead to some chaos
and it doesn't the fact that it doesn't

4100
01:10:02,709 --> 01:10:02,719
and it doesn't the fact that it doesn't
 

4101
01:10:02,719 --> 01:10:04,630
and it doesn't the fact that it doesn't
tells you something about the atmosphere

4102
01:10:04,630 --> 01:10:04,640
tells you something about the atmosphere
 

4103
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:06,149
tells you something about the atmosphere
so atmospheres have a property that

4104
01:10:06,149 --> 01:10:06,159
so atmospheres have a property that
 

4105
01:10:06,159 --> 01:10:07,590
so atmospheres have a property that
surfaces don't have which is that they

4106
01:10:07,590 --> 01:10:07,600
surfaces don't have which is that they
 

4107
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:09,110
surfaces don't have which is that they
can redistribute heat a lot more

4108
01:10:09,110 --> 01:10:09,120
can redistribute heat a lot more
 

4109
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:10,550
can redistribute heat a lot more
effectively right

4110
01:10:10,550 --> 01:10:10,560
effectively right
 

4111
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:12,510
effectively right
so they're a stabilizing like

4112
01:10:12,510 --> 01:10:12,520
so they're a stabilizing like
 

4113
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:13,750
so they're a stabilizing like
self-regulating

4114
01:10:13,750 --> 01:10:13,760
self-regulating
 

4115
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:15,590
self-regulating
aspect to them that they're able to deal

4116
01:10:15,590 --> 01:10:15,600
aspect to them that they're able to deal
 

4117
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:19,430
aspect to them that they're able to deal
with extreme conditions

4118
01:10:19,430 --> 01:10:19,440

 

4119
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:23,270

but predicting how that complex system

4120
01:10:23,270 --> 01:10:23,280
but predicting how that complex system
 

4121
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:26,550
but predicting how that complex system
unrolls is is very difficult as we know

4122
01:10:26,550 --> 01:10:26,560
unrolls is is very difficult as we know
 

4123
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:27,990
unrolls is is very difficult as we know
about predicting the weather on earth

4124
01:10:27,990 --> 01:10:28,000
about predicting the weather on earth
 

4125
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:28,390
about predicting the weather on earth
even

4126
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:28,400
even
 

4127
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:30,550
even
oh my goodness yeah the little variation

4128
01:10:30,550 --> 01:10:30,560
oh my goodness yeah the little variation
 

4129
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:31,990
oh my goodness yeah the little variation
we have on earth you know people have

4130
01:10:31,990 --> 01:10:32,000
we have on earth you know people have
 

4131
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:32,870
we have on earth you know people have
tried to

4132
01:10:32,870 --> 01:10:32,880
tried to
 

4133
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:34,790
tried to
put together global circulation models

4134
01:10:34,790 --> 01:10:34,800
put together global circulation models
 

4135
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:35,990
put together global circulation models
so you know we've done this for earth

4136
01:10:35,990 --> 01:10:36,000
so you know we've done this for earth
 

4137
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,270
so you know we've done this for earth
people have tried to do these for other

4138
01:10:37,270 --> 01:10:37,280
people have tried to do these for other
 

4139
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:38,470
people have tried to do these for other
planets as well

4140
01:10:38,470 --> 01:10:38,480
planets as well
 

4141
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:41,590
planets as well
and it is a really hard problem um

4142
01:10:41,590 --> 01:10:41,600
and it is a really hard problem um
 

4143
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:43,590
and it is a really hard problem um
so titan for example like i said it's

4144
01:10:43,590 --> 01:10:43,600
so titan for example like i said it's
 

4145
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:45,350
so titan for example like i said it's
it's one of the best studied atmospheres

4146
01:10:45,350 --> 01:10:45,360
it's one of the best studied atmospheres
 

4147
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:47,510
it's one of the best studied atmospheres
in the solar system and people have

4148
01:10:47,510 --> 01:10:47,520
in the solar system and people have
 

4149
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:49,110
in the solar system and people have
tried to make these global circulation

4150
01:10:49,110 --> 01:10:49,120
tried to make these global circulation
 

4151
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:51,030
tried to make these global circulation
models and actually predict what's going

4152
01:10:51,030 --> 01:10:51,040
models and actually predict what's going
 

4153
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:51,590
models and actually predict what's going
to

4154
01:10:51,590 --> 01:10:51,600
to
 

4155
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:53,990
to
to happen moving into sort of the next

4156
01:10:53,990 --> 01:10:54,000
to happen moving into sort of the next
 

4157
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,750
to happen moving into sort of the next
season of titan and those predictions

4158
01:10:55,750 --> 01:10:55,760
season of titan and those predictions
 

4159
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:57,830
season of titan and those predictions
have ended up being wrong and so then

4160
01:10:57,830 --> 01:10:57,840
have ended up being wrong and so then
 

4161
01:10:57,840 --> 01:10:58,390
have ended up being wrong and so then
you know

4162
01:10:58,390 --> 01:10:58,400
you know
 

4163
01:10:58,400 --> 01:10:59,910
you know
i i don't know it's always exciting when

4164
01:10:59,910 --> 01:10:59,920
i i don't know it's always exciting when
 

4165
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:01,510
i i don't know it's always exciting when
a prediction is wrong because it means

4166
01:11:01,510 --> 01:11:01,520
a prediction is wrong because it means
 

4167
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:02,149
a prediction is wrong because it means
that

4168
01:11:02,149 --> 01:11:02,159
that
 

4169
01:11:02,159 --> 01:11:03,510
that
there's something more to learn like

4170
01:11:03,510 --> 01:11:03,520
there's something more to learn like
 

4171
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:05,750
there's something more to learn like
your theory wasn't sufficient

4172
01:11:05,750 --> 01:11:05,760
your theory wasn't sufficient
 

4173
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:07,110
your theory wasn't sufficient
and then you get to go back and learn

4174
01:11:07,110 --> 01:11:07,120
and then you get to go back and learn
 

4175
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:08,870
and then you get to go back and learn
something by how you have to modify the

4176
01:11:08,870 --> 01:11:08,880
something by how you have to modify the
 

4177
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:11,990
something by how you have to modify the
theory to make it fit

4178
01:11:11,990 --> 01:11:12,000
theory to make it fit
 

4179
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,669
theory to make it fit
excited by the possibility of one day

4180
01:11:13,669 --> 01:11:13,679
excited by the possibility of one day
 

4181
01:11:13,679 --> 01:11:15,350
excited by the possibility of one day
there'll be for various moons and

4182
01:11:15,350 --> 01:11:15,360
there'll be for various moons and
 

4183
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:17,750
there'll be for various moons and
planets there'll be uh

4184
01:11:17,750 --> 01:11:17,760
planets there'll be uh
 

4185
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:20,470
planets there'll be uh
like news programs reporting the weather

4186
01:11:20,470 --> 01:11:20,480
like news programs reporting the weather
 

4187
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:22,229
like news programs reporting the weather
with the fake confidence of

4188
01:11:22,229 --> 01:11:22,239
with the fake confidence of
 

4189
01:11:22,239 --> 01:11:25,350
with the fake confidence of
like as if you can predict the weather

4190
01:11:25,350 --> 01:11:25,360
like as if you can predict the weather
 

4191
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:27,189
like as if you can predict the weather
uh we talked quite a bit about plants

4192
01:11:27,189 --> 01:11:27,199
uh we talked quite a bit about plants
 

4193
01:11:27,199 --> 01:11:29,270
uh we talked quite a bit about plants
and moons can we talk

4194
01:11:29,270 --> 01:11:29,280
and moons can we talk
 

4195
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:32,229
and moons can we talk
a little bit about asteroids for sure

4196
01:11:32,229 --> 01:11:32,239
a little bit about asteroids for sure
 

4197
01:11:32,239 --> 01:11:34,229
a little bit about asteroids for sure
what is uh what's an asteroid

4198
01:11:34,229 --> 01:11:34,239
what is uh what's an asteroid
 

4199
01:11:34,239 --> 01:11:36,950
what is uh what's an asteroid
and what kind of asteroids are there so

4200
01:11:36,950 --> 01:11:36,960
and what kind of asteroids are there so
 

4201
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:37,830
and what kind of asteroids are there so
the asteroids

4202
01:11:37,830 --> 01:11:37,840
the asteroids
 

4203
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:40,149
the asteroids
let's talk about just the restricted to

4204
01:11:40,149 --> 01:11:40,159
let's talk about just the restricted to
 

4205
01:11:40,159 --> 01:11:42,149
let's talk about just the restricted to
the main asteroid belt which is the

4206
01:11:42,149 --> 01:11:42,159
the main asteroid belt which is the
 

4207
01:11:42,159 --> 01:11:42,870
the main asteroid belt which is the
region

region
 

4209
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:46,070
region
it's a region of debris basically

4210
01:11:46,070 --> 01:11:46,080
it's a region of debris basically
 

4211
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:46,709
it's a region of debris basically
between

4212

4215
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:55,430

the these sort of belts of debris

4216
01:11:55,430 --> 01:11:55,440
the these sort of belts of debris
 

4217
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:56,790
the these sort of belts of debris
throughout the solar system the outer

solar system
you know the kuiper belt that we talked

4222
01:11:59,669 --> 01:11:59,679
you know the kuiper belt that we talked
 

4223
01:11:59,679 --> 01:12:01,270
you know the kuiper belt that we talked
about the asteroid belt as well as

4224
01:12:01,270 --> 01:12:01,280
about the asteroid belt as well as
 

4225
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:03,030
about the asteroid belt as well as
certain other populations where they

accumulate because they're

4228
01:12:04,310 --> 01:12:04,320
accumulate because they're
 

4229
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:07,350
accumulate because they're
gravitationally more favored

4230
01:12:07,350 --> 01:12:07,360
gravitationally more favored
 

4231
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:10,709
gravitationally more favored
our remnant objects from the origin of

4232
01:12:10,709 --> 01:12:10,719
our remnant objects from the origin of
 

4233
01:12:10,719 --> 01:12:12,229
our remnant objects from the origin of
the solar system and so one of the

4234
01:12:12,229 --> 01:12:12,239
the solar system and so one of the
 

4235
01:12:12,239 --> 01:12:13,110
the solar system and so one of the
reasons

4236
01:12:13,110 --> 01:12:13,120
reasons
 

4237
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:16,229
reasons
that we are so interested in them aside

4238
01:12:16,229 --> 01:12:16,239
that we are so interested in them aside
 

4239
01:12:16,239 --> 01:12:17,590
that we are so interested in them aside
from potentially the fact that they

4240
01:12:17,590 --> 01:12:17,600
from potentially the fact that they
 

4241
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:19,910
from potentially the fact that they
could come hit earth but

4242
01:12:19,910 --> 01:12:19,920
could come hit earth but
 

4243
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:23,270
could come hit earth but
scientifically it's

4244
01:12:23,270 --> 01:12:23,280
scientifically it's
 

4245
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:26,950
scientifically it's
um it gives us a window into

4246
01:12:26,950 --> 01:12:26,960
um it gives us a window into
 

4247
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:28,229
um it gives us a window into
understanding the

4248
01:12:28,229 --> 01:12:28,239
understanding the
 

4249
01:12:28,239 --> 01:12:31,830
understanding the
composition uh of the material from

4250
01:12:31,830 --> 01:12:31,840
composition uh of the material from
 

4251
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:33,430
composition uh of the material from
which earth and the other plant is

4252
01:12:33,430 --> 01:12:33,440
which earth and the other plant is
 

4253
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:34,229
which earth and the other plant is
formed

4254
01:12:34,229 --> 01:12:34,239
formed
 

4255
01:12:34,239 --> 01:12:36,390
formed
and how that material was kind of

4256
01:12:36,390 --> 01:12:36,400
and how that material was kind of
 

4257
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:38,149
and how that material was kind of
redistributed over the

4258
01:12:38,149 --> 01:12:38,159
redistributed over the
 

4259
01:12:38,159 --> 01:12:40,390
redistributed over the
the history of the solar system so the

4260
01:12:40,390 --> 01:12:40,400
the history of the solar system so the
 

4261
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:41,750
the history of the solar system so the
asteroids

4262
01:12:41,750 --> 01:12:41,760
asteroids
 

4263
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:43,669
asteroids
one could classify them in two different

4264
01:12:43,669 --> 01:12:43,679
one could classify them in two different
 

4265
01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:46,149
one could classify them in two different
ways some of them are ancient objects so

4266
01:12:46,149 --> 01:12:46,159
ways some of them are ancient objects so
 

4267
01:12:46,159 --> 01:12:49,669
ways some of them are ancient objects so
they accreted

4268
01:12:49,669 --> 01:12:49,679
they accreted
 

4269
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:52,950
they accreted
out of the the sort of disk of material

4270
01:12:52,950 --> 01:12:52,960
out of the the sort of disk of material
 

4271
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:54,709
out of the the sort of disk of material
that the whole solar system formed out

4272
01:12:54,709 --> 01:12:54,719
that the whole solar system formed out
 

4273
01:12:54,719 --> 01:12:57,590
that the whole solar system formed out
of um and have kind of

4274
01:12:57,590 --> 01:12:57,600
of um and have kind of
 

4275
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:01,430
of um and have kind of
remained ever since more or less the

4276
01:13:01,430 --> 01:13:01,440
remained ever since more or less the
 

4277
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:01,910
remained ever since more or less the
same

4278
01:13:01,910 --> 01:13:01,920
same
 

4279
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:03,830
same
um they've probably collided with each

4280
01:13:03,830 --> 01:13:03,840
um they've probably collided with each
 

4281
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:05,270
um they've probably collided with each
other and we see the all these

4282
01:13:05,270 --> 01:13:05,280
other and we see the all these
 

4283
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:06,630
other and we see the all these
collisional fragments and you can

4284
01:13:06,630 --> 01:13:06,640
collisional fragments and you can
 

4285
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:07,750
collisional fragments and you can
actually

4286
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:07,760
actually
 

4287
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:10,870
actually
look and um based on their orbits say

4288
01:13:10,870 --> 01:13:10,880
look and um based on their orbits say
 

4289
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:13,110
look and um based on their orbits say
you know like these 50 objects

4290
01:13:13,110 --> 01:13:13,120
you know like these 50 objects
 

4291
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:16,149
you know like these 50 objects
originated as the same object

4292
01:13:16,149 --> 01:13:16,159
originated as the same object
 

4293
01:13:16,159 --> 01:13:17,590
originated as the same object
you can see them kind of dynamically

4294
01:13:17,590 --> 01:13:17,600
you can see them kind of dynamically
 

4295
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:20,310
you can see them kind of dynamically
moving apart after some big collision

4296
01:13:20,310 --> 01:13:20,320
moving apart after some big collision
 

4297
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:23,910
moving apart after some big collision
um and so some of them are these ancient

4298
01:13:23,910 --> 01:13:23,920
um and so some of them are these ancient
 

4299
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:25,350
um and so some of them are these ancient
objects maybe that have undergone

4300
01:13:25,350 --> 01:13:25,360
objects maybe that have undergone
 

4301
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:26,470
objects maybe that have undergone
collisions and then

4302
01:13:26,470 --> 01:13:26,480
collisions and then
 

4303
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:28,070
collisions and then
there's this other category of object

4304
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:28,080
there's this other category of object
 

4305
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:30,229
there's this other category of object
that is the one that i personally find

4306
01:13:30,229 --> 01:13:30,239
that is the one that i personally find
 

4307
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:32,370
that is the one that i personally find
really interesting which is um

4308
01:13:32,370 --> 01:13:32,380
really interesting which is um
 

4309
01:13:32,380 --> 01:13:33,430
really interesting which is um

remnants of objects that could have been

4312
01:13:36,550 --> 01:13:36,560
remnants of objects that could have been
 

4313
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:39,750
remnants of objects that could have been
planets so

4314
01:13:39,750 --> 01:13:39,760
planets so
 

4315
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:42,390
planets so
early on a bunch of potential planets

4316
01:13:42,390 --> 01:13:42,400
early on a bunch of potential planets
 

4317
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:43,669
early on a bunch of potential planets
secreted that we call

4318
01:13:43,669 --> 01:13:43,679
secreted that we call
 

4319
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:45,830
secreted that we call
planetesimals and they formed and they

4320
01:13:45,830 --> 01:13:45,840
planetesimals and they formed and they
 

4321
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:47,270
planetesimals and they formed and they
formed with a lot of energy and they had

4322
01:13:47,270 --> 01:13:47,280
formed with a lot of energy and they had
 

4323
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:49,110
formed with a lot of energy and they had
enough time to actually differentiate so

4324
01:13:49,110 --> 01:13:49,120
enough time to actually differentiate so
 

4325
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:50,709
enough time to actually differentiate so
some of these objects differentiated

4326
01:13:50,709 --> 01:13:50,719
some of these objects differentiated
 

4327
01:13:50,719 --> 01:13:53,350
some of these objects differentiated
into cores and mantles and crests

4328
01:13:53,350 --> 01:13:53,360
into cores and mantles and crests
 

4329
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:55,990
into cores and mantles and crests
and then they were subsequently

4330
01:13:55,990 --> 01:13:56,000
and then they were subsequently
 

4331
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,590
and then they were subsequently
disrupted in these

4332
01:13:57,590 --> 01:13:57,600
disrupted in these
 

4333
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:01,189
disrupted in these
massive collisions and they now we have

4334
01:14:01,189 --> 01:14:01,199
massive collisions and they now we have
 

4335
01:14:01,199 --> 01:14:01,750
massive collisions and they now we have
these

4336
01:14:01,750 --> 01:14:01,760
these
 

4337
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:03,750
these
fragments we think fragments floating

4338
01:14:03,750 --> 01:14:03,760
fragments we think fragments floating
 

4339
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:05,669
fragments we think fragments floating
around the asteroid belt that are like

4340
01:14:05,669 --> 01:14:05,679
around the asteroid belt that are like
 

4341
01:14:05,679 --> 01:14:07,750
around the asteroid belt that are like
bits of mantle bits of core bits of

4342
01:14:07,750 --> 01:14:07,760
bits of mantle bits of core bits of
 

4343
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:09,350
bits of mantle bits of core bits of
crust basically

4344
01:14:09,350 --> 01:14:09,360
crust basically
 

4345
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:11,510
crust basically
um so it's like puzzle pieces you might

4346
01:14:11,510 --> 01:14:11,520
um so it's like puzzle pieces you might
 

4347
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:13,350
um so it's like puzzle pieces you might
be able to stitch together

4348
01:14:13,350 --> 01:14:13,360
be able to stitch together
 

4349
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:16,790
be able to stitch together
or i guess it's it's all uh

4350
01:14:16,790 --> 01:14:16,800
or i guess it's it's all uh
 

4351
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:18,630
or i guess it's it's all uh
it's all mixed up so you can't stitch

4352
01:14:18,630 --> 01:14:18,640
it's all mixed up so you can't stitch
 

4353
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:20,870
it's all mixed up so you can't stitch
together the original planet

4354
01:14:20,870 --> 01:14:20,880
together the original planet
 

4355
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:24,070
together the original planet
candidates or is that possible to try to

4356
01:14:24,070 --> 01:14:24,080
candidates or is that possible to try to
 

4357
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:25,910
candidates or is that possible to try to
see if they kind of

4358
01:14:25,910 --> 01:14:25,920
see if they kind of
 

4359
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:27,590
see if they kind of
i mean there's too many there's too many

4360
01:14:27,590 --> 01:14:27,600
i mean there's too many there's too many
 

4361
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:29,510
i mean there's too many there's too many
objects in there too i think that there

4362
01:14:29,510 --> 01:14:29,520
objects in there too i think that there
 

4363
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:31,110
objects in there too i think that there
are cases where people have

4364
01:14:31,110 --> 01:14:31,120
are cases where people have
 

4365
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:33,430
are cases where people have
have kind of looked at objects and by

4366
01:14:33,430 --> 01:14:33,440
have kind of looked at objects and by
 

4367
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:35,110
have kind of looked at objects and by
looking at their orbits they say these

4368
01:14:35,110 --> 01:14:35,120
looking at their orbits they say these
 

4369
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:36,870
looking at their orbits they say these
objects should have originated together

4370
01:14:36,870 --> 01:14:36,880
objects should have originated together
 

4371
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:37,910
objects should have originated together
but they have very different

4372
01:14:37,910 --> 01:14:37,920
but they have very different
 

4373
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:40,709
but they have very different
compositions and so then you can

4374
01:14:40,709 --> 01:14:40,719
compositions and so then you can
 

4375
01:14:40,719 --> 01:14:42,630
compositions and so then you can
hypothesize maybe they were different

4376
01:14:42,630 --> 01:14:42,640
hypothesize maybe they were different
 

4377
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:44,630
hypothesize maybe they were different
fragments of a differentiated object

4378
01:14:44,630 --> 01:14:44,640
fragments of a differentiated object
 

4379
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:46,229
fragments of a differentiated object
but one of the really cool things about

4380
01:14:46,229 --> 01:14:46,239
but one of the really cool things about
 

4381
01:14:46,239 --> 01:14:47,830
but one of the really cool things about
this is you know we've been talking

4382
01:14:47,830 --> 01:14:47,840
this is you know we've been talking
 

4383
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:49,350
this is you know we've been talking
about

4384
01:14:49,350 --> 01:14:49,360
about
 

4385
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:51,510
about
getting clues into the interiors of

4386
01:14:51,510 --> 01:14:51,520
getting clues into the interiors of
 

4387
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:52,390
getting clues into the interiors of
planets

4388
01:14:52,390 --> 01:14:52,400
planets
 

4389
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:55,910
planets
we've never seen a planetary core or

4390
01:14:55,910 --> 01:14:55,920
we've never seen a planetary core or
 

4391
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:56,870
we've never seen a planetary core or
deep mantle

4392
01:14:56,870 --> 01:14:56,880
deep mantle
 

4393
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:58,550
deep mantle
directly some mantle material comes up

4394
01:14:58,550 --> 01:14:58,560
directly some mantle material comes up
 

4395
01:14:58,560 --> 01:14:59,910
directly some mantle material comes up
on earth's surface and then we can see

4396
01:14:59,910 --> 01:14:59,920
on earth's surface and then we can see
 

4397
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:00,470
on earth's surface and then we can see
it but

4398
01:15:00,470 --> 01:15:00,480
it but
 

4399
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:03,590
it but
you know in sort of in bulk um

4400
01:15:03,590 --> 01:15:03,600
you know in sort of in bulk um
 

4401
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:05,030
you know in sort of in bulk um
we haven't seen these things directly

4402
01:15:05,030 --> 01:15:05,040
we haven't seen these things directly
 

4403
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:07,669
we haven't seen these things directly
and these asteroids potentially give us

4404
01:15:07,669 --> 01:15:07,679
and these asteroids potentially give us
 

4405
01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:09,110
and these asteroids potentially give us
a chance to like

4406
01:15:09,110 --> 01:15:09,120
a chance to like
 

4407
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:11,350
a chance to like
look at what our own core and mantle is

4408
01:15:11,350 --> 01:15:11,360
look at what our own core and mantle is
 

4409
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:12,950
look at what our own core and mantle is
like or at least

4410
01:15:12,950 --> 01:15:12,960
like or at least
 

4411
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:14,550
like or at least
would be like if it had been also

4412
01:15:14,550 --> 01:15:14,560
would be like if it had been also
 

4413
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:16,390
would be like if it had been also
floating through space for a few billion

4414
01:15:16,390 --> 01:15:16,400
floating through space for a few billion
 

4415
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:17,030
floating through space for a few billion
years and

4416
01:15:17,030 --> 01:15:17,040
years and
 

4417
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:19,910
years and
and getting irradiated and all that uh

4418
01:15:19,910 --> 01:15:19,920
and getting irradiated and all that uh
 

4419
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:20,390
and getting irradiated and all that uh
but it's

4420
01:15:20,390 --> 01:15:20,400
but it's
 

4421
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:23,189
but it's
it's a cool potential window or like

4422
01:15:23,189 --> 01:15:23,199
it's a cool potential window or like
 

4423
01:15:23,199 --> 01:15:25,350
it's a cool potential window or like
analogy into the interior of our own

4424
01:15:25,350 --> 01:15:25,360
analogy into the interior of our own
 

4425
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:26,310
analogy into the interior of our own

4427
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:28,149
planet
well how do you begin studying some of

4428
01:15:28,149 --> 01:15:28,159
well how do you begin studying some of
 

4429
01:15:28,159 --> 01:15:30,390
well how do you begin studying some of
these asteroids

4430
01:15:30,390 --> 01:15:30,400
these asteroids
 

4431
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:32,070
these asteroids
what uh if you were to put together a

4432
01:15:32,070 --> 01:15:32,080
what uh if you were to put together a
 

4433
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:33,510
what uh if you were to put together a
study like what are the interesting

4434
01:15:33,510 --> 01:15:33,520
study like what are the interesting
 

4435
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:35,430
study like what are the interesting
questions to ask

4436
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:35,440
questions to ask
 

4437
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:37,270
questions to ask
that a little bit more specific do you

4438
01:15:37,270 --> 01:15:37,280
that a little bit more specific do you
 

4439
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:39,030
that a little bit more specific do you
find a favorite

4440
01:15:39,030 --> 01:15:39,040
find a favorite
 

4441
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:41,110
find a favorite
asteroid that could be tracked and try

4442
01:15:41,110 --> 01:15:41,120
asteroid that could be tracked and try
 

4443
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:44,630
asteroid that could be tracked and try
to try to track it through telescopes

4444
01:15:44,630 --> 01:15:44,640
to try to track it through telescopes
 

4445
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:47,910
to try to track it through telescopes
or do you uh is it has to be

4446
01:15:47,910 --> 01:15:47,920
or do you uh is it has to be
 

4447
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:50,550
or do you uh is it has to be
you have to land on those things to

4448
01:15:50,550 --> 01:15:50,560
you have to land on those things to
 

4449
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:51,590
you have to land on those things to
study it

4450
01:15:51,590 --> 01:15:51,600
study it
 

4451
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:53,590
study it
so when it comes to the asteroids

4452
01:15:53,590 --> 01:15:53,600
so when it comes to the asteroids
 

4453
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:55,430
so when it comes to the asteroids
there's so many of them and the big

4454
01:15:55,430 --> 01:15:55,440
there's so many of them and the big
 

4455
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:58,870
there's so many of them and the big
pictures or the the big questions

4456
01:15:58,870 --> 01:15:58,880
pictures or the the big questions
 

4457
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:02,229
pictures or the the big questions
are answered

4458
01:16:02,229 --> 01:16:02,239
are answered
 

4459
01:16:02,239 --> 01:16:06,709
are answered
um so some questions can be answered by

4460
01:16:06,709 --> 01:16:06,719
um so some questions can be answered by
 

4461
01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:08,709
um so some questions can be answered by
zooming in in detail on individual

4462
01:16:08,709 --> 01:16:08,719
zooming in in detail on individual
 

4463
01:16:08,719 --> 01:16:10,630
zooming in in detail on individual
object but mostly you're trying to do a

4464
01:16:10,630 --> 01:16:10,640
object but mostly you're trying to do a
 

4465
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:14,390
object but mostly you're trying to do a
statistical study so you want to look at

4466
01:16:14,390 --> 01:16:14,400
statistical study so you want to look at
 

4467
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:16,470
statistical study so you want to look at
thousands of objects even hundreds of

4468
01:16:16,470 --> 01:16:16,480
thousands of objects even hundreds of
 

4469
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:18,070
thousands of objects even hundreds of
thousands of objects

4470
01:16:18,070 --> 01:16:18,080
thousands of objects
 

4471
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:21,270
thousands of objects
and figure out what their composition is

4472
01:16:21,270 --> 01:16:21,280
and figure out what their composition is
 

4473
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:24,630
and figure out what their composition is
and look at you know how many

4474
01:16:24,630 --> 01:16:24,640
and look at you know how many
 

4475
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:25,990
and look at you know how many
big asteroids there are of this

4476
01:16:25,990 --> 01:16:26,000
big asteroids there are of this
 

4477
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,750
big asteroids there are of this
composition versus how many small

4478
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:27,760
composition versus how many small
 

4479
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:29,189
composition versus how many small
asteroids of this other composition and

4480
01:16:29,189 --> 01:16:29,199
asteroids of this other composition and
 

4481
01:16:29,199 --> 01:16:30,709
asteroids of this other composition and
put together these kind of

4482
01:16:30,709 --> 01:16:30,719
put together these kind of
 

4483
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:33,430
put together these kind of
statistical properties of the asteroid

4484
01:16:33,430 --> 01:16:33,440
statistical properties of the asteroid
 

4485
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:35,430
statistical properties of the asteroid
belt and those properties can be

4486
01:16:35,430 --> 01:16:35,440
belt and those properties can be
 

4487
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:38,229
belt and those properties can be
directly compared with the results of

4488
01:16:38,229 --> 01:16:38,239
directly compared with the results of
 

4489
01:16:38,239 --> 01:16:40,310
directly compared with the results of
simulations for the the formation of the

4490
01:16:40,310 --> 01:16:40,320
simulations for the the formation of the
 

4491
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:42,070
simulations for the the formation of the
solar system

4492
01:16:42,070 --> 01:16:42,080
solar system
 

4493
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:43,590
solar system
what do we know about the surfaces of

4494
01:16:43,590 --> 01:16:43,600
what do we know about the surfaces of
 

4495
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:45,430
what do we know about the surfaces of
asteroids or the con

4496
01:16:45,430 --> 01:16:45,440
asteroids or the con
 

4497
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:48,390
asteroids or the con
the the contents of the insides of

4498
01:16:48,390 --> 01:16:48,400
the the contents of the insides of
 

4499
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:50,310
the the contents of the insides of
asteroids

4500
01:16:50,310 --> 01:16:50,320
asteroids
 

4501
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:53,510
asteroids
and what are still open questions so

4502
01:16:53,510 --> 01:16:53,520
and what are still open questions so
 

4503
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:56,310
and what are still open questions so
i would say that we don't know a whole

4504
01:16:56,310 --> 01:16:56,320
i would say that we don't know a whole
 

4505
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:57,350
i would say that we don't know a whole
lot about their

4506
01:16:57,350 --> 01:16:57,360
lot about their
 

4507
01:16:57,360 --> 01:17:01,189
lot about their
compositions um most of them are small

4508
01:17:01,189 --> 01:17:01,199
compositions um most of them are small
 

4509
01:17:01,199 --> 01:17:04,149
compositions um most of them are small
and so you can't study them in such

4510
01:17:04,149 --> 01:17:04,159
and so you can't study them in such
 

4511
01:17:04,159 --> 01:17:05,590
and so you can't study them in such
detail with

4512
01:17:05,590 --> 01:17:05,600
detail with
 

4513
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:07,910
detail with
telescopes as as you could you know a

4514
01:17:07,910 --> 01:17:07,920
telescopes as as you could you know a
 

4515
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:08,870
telescopes as as you could you know a
planet or moon

4516
01:17:08,870 --> 01:17:08,880
planet or moon
 

4517
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:10,550
planet or moon
and at the same time because there are

4518
01:17:10,550 --> 01:17:10,560
and at the same time because there are
 

4519
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:12,149
and at the same time because there are
so many of them you could send a

4520
01:17:12,149 --> 01:17:12,159
so many of them you could send a
 

4521
01:17:12,159 --> 01:17:13,669
so many of them you could send a
spacecraft to a few

4522
01:17:13,669 --> 01:17:13,679
spacecraft to a few
 

4523
01:17:13,679 --> 01:17:16,070
spacecraft to a few
uh but you can't really like get a

4524
01:17:16,070 --> 01:17:16,080
uh but you can't really like get a
 

4525
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:17,430
uh but you can't really like get a
statistical survey

4526
01:17:17,430 --> 01:17:17,440
statistical survey
 

4527
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:20,709
statistical survey
with spacecraft and so a lot of

4528
01:17:20,709 --> 01:17:20,719
with spacecraft and so a lot of
 

4529
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:22,310
with spacecraft and so a lot of
what we a lot of what has been done

4530
01:17:22,310 --> 01:17:22,320
what we a lot of what has been done
 

4531
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:24,310
what we a lot of what has been done
comes down to sort of classification you

4532
01:17:24,310 --> 01:17:24,320
comes down to sort of classification you
 

4533
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:25,110
comes down to sort of classification you
look at

4534
01:17:25,110 --> 01:17:25,120
look at
 

4535
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:27,750
look at
how bright they are you look at uh

4536
01:17:27,750 --> 01:17:27,760
how bright they are you look at uh
 

4537
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:28,470
how bright they are you look at uh
whether

4538
01:17:28,470 --> 01:17:28,480
whether
 

4539
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:31,110
whether
they're red or blue simply you know

4540
01:17:31,110 --> 01:17:31,120
they're red or blue simply you know
 

4541
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:33,110
they're red or blue simply you know
whether their spectrum is sloped towards

4542
01:17:33,110 --> 01:17:33,120
whether their spectrum is sloped towards
 

4543
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:34,950
whether their spectrum is sloped towards
long wavelengths or short wavelengths

4544
01:17:34,950 --> 01:17:34,960
long wavelengths or short wavelengths
 

4545
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:38,550
long wavelengths or short wavelengths
there are certain uh if you if you

4546
01:17:38,550 --> 01:17:38,560
there are certain uh if you if you
 

4547
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:40,709
there are certain uh if you if you
point a spectrograph at their surfaces

4548
01:17:40,709 --> 01:17:40,719
point a spectrograph at their surfaces
 

4549
01:17:40,719 --> 01:17:42,149
point a spectrograph at their surfaces
there are certain features you can see

4550
01:17:42,149 --> 01:17:42,159
there are certain features you can see
 

4551
01:17:42,159 --> 01:17:43,590
there are certain features you can see
so you can tell that some of them have

4552
01:17:43,590 --> 01:17:43,600
so you can tell that some of them have
 

4553
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:45,350
so you can tell that some of them have
silicates on them

4554
01:17:45,350 --> 01:17:45,360
silicates on them
 

4555
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:48,550
silicates on them
um and but these are the sort of

4556
01:17:48,550 --> 01:17:48,560
um and but these are the sort of
 

4557
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:50,149
um and but these are the sort of
they're pretty basic questions we're

4558
01:17:50,149 --> 01:17:50,159
they're pretty basic questions we're
 

4559
01:17:50,159 --> 01:17:52,390
they're pretty basic questions we're
still trying to classify them based on

4560
01:17:52,390 --> 01:17:52,400
still trying to classify them based on
 

4561
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:54,709
still trying to classify them based on
fairly basic information in kind of

4562
01:17:54,709 --> 01:17:54,719
fairly basic information in kind of
 

4563
01:17:54,719 --> 01:17:56,229
fairly basic information in kind of
combination with our general

4564
01:17:56,229 --> 01:17:56,239
combination with our general
 

4565
01:17:56,239 --> 01:17:57,590
combination with our general
understanding of

4566
01:17:57,590 --> 01:17:57,600
understanding of
 

4567
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:59,110
understanding of
the material the solar system formed

4568
01:17:59,110 --> 01:17:59,120
the material the solar system formed
 

4569
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:01,030
the material the solar system formed
from and so you're sort of you can't

4570
01:18:01,030 --> 01:18:01,040
from and so you're sort of you can't
 

4571
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:02,390
from and so you're sort of you can't
you're coming in with prior knowledge

4572
01:18:02,390 --> 01:18:02,400
you're coming in with prior knowledge
 

4573
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:04,070
you're coming in with prior knowledge
which is that you more or less know what

4574
01:18:04,070 --> 01:18:04,080
which is that you more or less know what
 

4575
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:05,350
which is that you more or less know what
the materials are the solar system

4576
01:18:05,350 --> 01:18:05,360
the materials are the solar system
 

4577
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:06,950
the materials are the solar system
formed from and then you're trying to

4578
01:18:06,950 --> 01:18:06,960
formed from and then you're trying to
 

4579
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:09,270
formed from and then you're trying to
classify them into these categories

4580
01:18:09,270 --> 01:18:09,280
classify them into these categories
 

4581
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:11,189
classify them into these categories
there's still

4582
01:18:11,189 --> 01:18:11,199
there's still
 

4583
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:13,510
there's still
a huge amount of room for for

4584
01:18:13,510 --> 01:18:13,520
a huge amount of room for for
 

4585
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:15,110
a huge amount of room for for
understanding them better

4586
01:18:15,110 --> 01:18:15,120
understanding them better
 

4587
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:17,189
understanding them better
um and for understanding how their

4588
01:18:17,189 --> 01:18:17,199
um and for understanding how their
 

4589
01:18:17,199 --> 01:18:18,390
um and for understanding how their
surfaces are changing

4590
01:18:18,390 --> 01:18:18,400
surfaces are changing
 

4591
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:20,790
surfaces are changing
in the space environment is it hard to

4592
01:18:20,790 --> 01:18:20,800
in the space environment is it hard to
 

4593
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:22,950
in the space environment is it hard to
land on an asteroid

4594
01:18:22,950 --> 01:18:22,960
land on an asteroid
 

4595
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:26,070
land on an asteroid
is this uh is this a dumb question it

4596
01:18:26,070 --> 01:18:26,080
is this uh is this a dumb question it
 

4597
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:27,189
is this uh is this a dumb question it
feels like uh

4598
01:18:27,189 --> 01:18:27,199
feels like uh
 

4599
01:18:27,199 --> 01:18:30,470
feels like uh
it would be quite difficult

4600
01:18:30,470 --> 01:18:30,480
it would be quite difficult
 

4601
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:33,669
it would be quite difficult
to actually operate a spacecraft

4602
01:18:33,669 --> 01:18:33,679
to actually operate a spacecraft
 

4603
01:18:33,679 --> 01:18:39,350
to actually operate a spacecraft
in such a uh dense field of debris

4604
01:18:39,350 --> 01:18:39,360
in such a uh dense field of debris
 

4605
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:41,830
in such a uh dense field of debris
oh the asteroid belt um there's a ton of

4606
01:18:41,830 --> 01:18:41,840
oh the asteroid belt um there's a ton of
 

4607
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:43,510
oh the asteroid belt um there's a ton of
material there but it's actually not

4608
01:18:43,510 --> 01:18:43,520
material there but it's actually not
 

4609
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:45,590
material there but it's actually not
that dense it is mostly open space

4610
01:18:45,590 --> 01:18:45,600
that dense it is mostly open space
 

4611
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:48,390
that dense it is mostly open space
okay uh so so mentally do picture like

4612
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:48,400
okay uh so so mentally do picture like
 

4613
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:49,669
okay uh so so mentally do picture like
mostly open space with

4614
01:18:49,669 --> 01:18:49,679
mostly open space with
 

4615
01:18:49,679 --> 01:18:52,390
mostly open space with
with some rocks uh the problem is some

4616
01:18:52,390 --> 01:18:52,400
with some rocks uh the problem is some
 

4617
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:53,110
with some rocks uh the problem is some
of them are not

4618
01:18:53,110 --> 01:18:53,120
of them are not
 

4619
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:55,110
of them are not
thought to be solid so some of these

4620
01:18:55,110 --> 01:18:55,120
thought to be solid so some of these
 

4621
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:57,030
thought to be solid so some of these
asteroids especially these these core

4622
01:18:57,030 --> 01:18:57,040
asteroids especially these these core
 

4623
01:18:57,040 --> 01:18:58,709
asteroids especially these these core
mantle fragments you can think of as

4624
01:18:58,709 --> 01:18:58,719
mantle fragments you can think of as
 

4625
01:18:58,719 --> 01:19:00,470
mantle fragments you can think of as
sort of solid like a planet

4626
01:19:00,470 --> 01:19:00,480
sort of solid like a planet
 

4627
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:02,310
sort of solid like a planet
but some of them are just kind of

4628
01:19:02,310 --> 01:19:02,320
but some of them are just kind of
 

4629
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:03,750
but some of them are just kind of
aggregates of

4630
01:19:03,750 --> 01:19:03,760
aggregates of
 

4631
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:06,630
aggregates of
material we call them rubble piles and

4632
01:19:06,630 --> 01:19:06,640
material we call them rubble piles and
 

4633
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:09,510
material we call them rubble piles and
so there's not necessarily

4634
01:19:09,510 --> 01:19:09,520
so there's not necessarily
 

4635
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:11,830
so there's not necessarily
might look like a rock but do a lot of

4636
01:19:11,830 --> 01:19:11,840
might look like a rock but do a lot of
 

4637
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:13,669
might look like a rock but do a lot of
them have kind of

4638
01:19:13,669 --> 01:19:13,679
them have kind of
 

4639
01:19:13,679 --> 01:19:16,149
them have kind of
clouds around them like a dust cloud

4640
01:19:16,149 --> 01:19:16,159
clouds around them like a dust cloud
 

4641
01:19:16,159 --> 01:19:16,950
clouds around them like a dust cloud
thing

4642
01:19:16,950 --> 01:19:16,960
thing
 

4643
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:19,669
thing
or like do you know what you're stepping

4644
01:19:19,669 --> 01:19:19,679
or like do you know what you're stepping
 

4645
01:19:19,679 --> 01:19:22,709
or like do you know what you're stepping
on when you try to land on it

4646
01:19:22,709 --> 01:19:22,719
on when you try to land on it
 

4647
01:19:22,719 --> 01:19:25,110
on when you try to land on it
like what are we supposed to be

4648
01:19:25,110 --> 01:19:25,120
like what are we supposed to be
 

4649
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:27,030
like what are we supposed to be
visualizing here this is like very few

4650
01:19:27,030 --> 01:19:27,040
visualizing here this is like very few
 

4651
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:28,870
visualizing here this is like very few
have water right

4652
01:19:28,870 --> 01:19:28,880
have water right
 

4653
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:30,390
have water right
there's some water in the outer part of

4654
01:19:30,390 --> 01:19:30,400
there's some water in the outer part of
 

4655
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:32,310
there's some water in the outer part of
the asteroid belt but they're not

4656
01:19:32,310 --> 01:19:32,320
the asteroid belt but they're not
 

4657
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:35,430
the asteroid belt but they're not
quite like comets okay um

4658
01:19:35,430 --> 01:19:35,440
quite like comets okay um
 

4659
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:36,790
quite like comets okay um
in the in the sense of having clouds

4660
01:19:36,790 --> 01:19:36,800
in the in the sense of having clouds
 

4661
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:38,630
in the in the sense of having clouds
around them there are some crazy

4662
01:19:38,630 --> 01:19:38,640
around them there are some crazy
 

4663
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:40,470
around them there are some crazy
asteroids that do become active like

4664
01:19:40,470 --> 01:19:40,480
asteroids that do become active like
 

4665
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:42,390
asteroids that do become active like
comets that's the whole other

4666
01:19:42,390 --> 01:19:42,400
comets that's the whole other
 

4667
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:43,830
comets that's the whole other
category of thing that we don't

4668
01:19:43,830 --> 01:19:43,840
category of thing that we don't
 

4669
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:45,590
category of thing that we don't
understand um

4670
01:19:45,590 --> 01:19:45,600
understand um
 

4671
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:47,270
understand um
but they're surfaces i mean we have

4672
01:19:47,270 --> 01:19:47,280
but they're surfaces i mean we have
 

4673
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:48,870
but they're surfaces i mean we have
visited some you can

4674
01:19:48,870 --> 01:19:48,880
visited some you can
 

4675
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:50,470
visited some you can
you know find pictures that spacecraft

4676
01:19:50,470 --> 01:19:50,480
you know find pictures that spacecraft
 

4677
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:51,590
you know find pictures that spacecraft
have taken of them we've actually

4678
01:19:51,590 --> 01:19:51,600
have taken of them we've actually
 

4679
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:52,709
have taken of them we've actually
scooped up material

4680
01:19:52,709 --> 01:19:52,719
scooped up material
 

4681
01:19:52,719 --> 01:19:54,149
scooped up material
off of the surface of some of these

4682
01:19:54,149 --> 01:19:54,159
off of the surface of some of these
 

4683
01:19:54,159 --> 01:19:56,070
off of the surface of some of these
objects we're bringing it back

4684
01:19:56,070 --> 01:19:56,080
objects we're bringing it back
 

4685
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:58,950
objects we're bringing it back
to analyze it in the lab um and there's

4686
01:19:58,950 --> 01:19:58,960
to analyze it in the lab um and there's
 

4687
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:00,870
to analyze it in the lab um and there's
a mission that's launching

4688
01:20:00,870 --> 01:20:00,880
a mission that's launching
 

4689
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:02,950
a mission that's launching
next year to land on one of these

4690
01:20:02,950 --> 01:20:02,960
next year to land on one of these
 

4691
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:04,149
next year to land on one of these
supposedly

4692
01:20:04,149 --> 01:20:04,159
supposedly
 

4693
01:20:04,159 --> 01:20:06,709
supposedly
core fragment objects to try to figure

4694
01:20:06,709 --> 01:20:06,719
core fragment objects to try to figure
 

4695
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:07,590
core fragment objects to try to figure
out what the heck

4696
01:20:07,590 --> 01:20:07,600
out what the heck
 

4697
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:10,070
out what the heck
it is and what's going on with it but

4698
01:20:10,070 --> 01:20:10,080
it is and what's going on with it but
 

4699
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:11,430
it is and what's going on with it but
the surfaces

4700
01:20:11,430 --> 01:20:11,440
the surfaces
 

4701
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:14,629
the surfaces
you know they're they're you can picture

4702
01:20:14,629 --> 01:20:14,639
you know they're they're you can picture
 

4703
01:20:14,639 --> 01:20:17,430
you know they're they're you can picture
a solid surface with some little grains

4704
01:20:17,430 --> 01:20:17,440
a solid surface with some little grains
 

4705
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:17,990
a solid surface with some little grains
of sand

4706
01:20:17,990 --> 01:20:18,000
of sand
 

4707
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:21,270
of sand
or pebbles on it and occasional boulders

4708
01:20:21,270 --> 01:20:21,280
or pebbles on it and occasional boulders
 

4709
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:24,550
or pebbles on it and occasional boulders
maybe some fine dusty regions dust kind

4710
01:20:24,550 --> 01:20:24,560
maybe some fine dusty regions dust kind
 

4711
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:26,149
maybe some fine dusty regions dust kind
of collecting in certain places

4712
01:20:26,149 --> 01:20:26,159
of collecting in certain places
 

4713
01:20:26,159 --> 01:20:30,149
of collecting in certain places
but is is there does do you worry about

4714
01:20:30,149 --> 01:20:30,159
but is is there does do you worry about
 

4715
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:32,870
but is is there does do you worry about
this is there any chance

4716
01:20:32,870 --> 01:20:32,880
this is there any chance
 

4717
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:36,629
this is there any chance
that one of these fellas destroys all of

4718
01:20:36,629 --> 01:20:36,639
that one of these fellas destroys all of
 

4719
01:20:36,639 --> 01:20:38,070
that one of these fellas destroys all of
human civilization

4720
01:20:38,070 --> 01:20:38,080
human civilization
 

4721
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:42,070
human civilization
by um an asteroid kind of

4722
01:20:42,070 --> 01:20:42,080
by um an asteroid kind of
 

4723
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:43,669
by um an asteroid kind of
colliding with something changing his

01:20:43,669 --> 01:20:43,679
colliding with something changing his
 

4725
01:20:43,679 --> 01:20:45,830
colliding with something changing his
trajectory and heading its way towards

earth
 

4729
01:20:47,199 --> 01:20:49,430
earth
that is definitely possible and it

4730
01:20:49,430 --> 01:20:49,440
that is definitely possible and it
 

4731
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:50,629
that is definitely possible and it
doesn't even

4732
01:20:50,629 --> 01:20:50,639
doesn't even
 

4733
01:20:50,639 --> 01:20:52,790
doesn't even
have to necessarily collide and change

4734
01:20:52,790 --> 01:20:52,800
have to necessarily collide and change
 

4735
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:53,990
have to necessarily collide and change
its trajectory

4736
01:20:53,990 --> 01:20:54,000
its trajectory
 

4737
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,550
its trajectory
we're not tracking all of them we can't

4738
01:20:56,550 --> 01:20:56,560
we're not tracking all of them we can't
 

4739
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:58,830
we're not tracking all of them we can't
track all of them yet you know they're

4740
01:20:58,830 --> 01:20:58,840
track all of them yet you know they're
 

4741
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:00,790
track all of them yet you know they're
still

4742
01:21:00,790 --> 01:21:00,800
still
 

4743
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:02,470
still
a lot of them people are people are

4744
01:21:02,470 --> 01:21:02,480
a lot of them people are people are
 

4745
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:04,070
a lot of them people are people are
tracking a lot of them and we are doing

4746
01:21:04,070 --> 01:21:04,080
tracking a lot of them and we are doing
 

4747
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:05,590
tracking a lot of them and we are doing
our best to track more of them but there

4748
01:21:05,590 --> 01:21:05,600
our best to track more of them but there
 

4749
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:06,790
our best to track more of them but there
are a lot of them out there

4750
01:21:06,790 --> 01:21:06,800
are a lot of them out there
 

4751
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:09,270
are a lot of them out there
and it would be potentially catastrophic

4752
01:21:09,270 --> 01:21:09,280
and it would be potentially catastrophic
 

4753
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:09,910
and it would be potentially catastrophic
if one of them

4754
01:21:09,910 --> 01:21:09,920
if one of them
 

4755
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:13,510
if one of them
impacted earth um have you are you aware

4756
01:21:13,510 --> 01:21:13,520
impacted earth um have you are you aware
 

4757
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:15,189
impacted earth um have you are you aware
of this um

4758
01:21:15,189 --> 01:21:15,199
of this um
 

4759
01:21:15,199 --> 01:21:18,470
of this um
apophis object so there's an asteroid a

4760
01:21:18,470 --> 01:21:18,480
apophis object so there's an asteroid a
 

4761
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:19,350
apophis object so there's an asteroid a
near-earth

4762
01:21:19,350 --> 01:21:19,360
near-earth
 

4763
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:21,430
near-earth
object called apophis that people

4764
01:21:21,430 --> 01:21:21,440
object called apophis that people
 

4765
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:23,830
object called apophis that people
thought had a decent probability of

4766
01:21:23,830 --> 01:21:23,840
thought had a decent probability of
 

4767
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:24,629
thought had a decent probability of
hitting

4768
01:21:24,629 --> 01:21:24,639
hitting
 

4769
01:21:24,639 --> 01:21:27,750
hitting
earth in 2029 and then potentially again

4770
01:21:27,750 --> 01:21:27,760
earth in 2029 and then potentially again
 

4771
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:29,750
earth in 2029 and then potentially again
in 2036 so they did a lot of studies

4772
01:21:29,750 --> 01:21:29,760
in 2036 so they did a lot of studies
 

4773
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:31,590
in 2036 so they did a lot of studies
it's not actually going to hit earth

4774
01:21:31,590 --> 01:21:31,600
it's not actually going to hit earth
 

4775
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:34,870
it's not actually going to hit earth
but it is going to come very close

4776
01:21:34,870 --> 01:21:34,880
but it is going to come very close
 

4777
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:37,350
but it is going to come very close
it's going to be visible in the sky and

4778
01:21:37,350 --> 01:21:37,360
it's going to be visible in the sky and
 

4779
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:38,550
it's going to be visible in the sky and
a relatively dark

4780
01:21:38,550 --> 01:21:38,560
a relatively dark
 

4781
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:40,950
a relatively dark
i mean not even that dark probably not

4782
01:21:40,950 --> 01:21:40,960
i mean not even that dark probably not
 

4783
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:42,070
i mean not even that dark probably not
visible from los

4784
01:21:42,070 --> 01:21:42,080
visible from los
 

4785
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:45,110
visible from los
angeles but um

4786
01:21:45,110 --> 01:21:45,120
angeles but um
 

4787
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:48,709
angeles but um
and it's gonna come a tenth of

4788
01:21:48,709 --> 01:21:48,719
and it's gonna come a tenth of
 

4789
01:21:48,719 --> 01:21:51,590
and it's gonna come a tenth of
the way between the earth and the moon

4790
01:21:51,590 --> 01:21:51,600
the way between the earth and the moon
 

4791
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:52,709
the way between the earth and the moon
it's going to come closer

4792
01:21:52,709 --> 01:21:52,719
it's going to come closer
 

4793
01:21:52,719 --> 01:21:54,390
it's going to come closer
apparently than some geosynchronous

4794
01:21:54,390 --> 01:21:54,400
apparently than some geosynchronous
 

4795
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:55,990
apparently than some geosynchronous
communication satellites

4796
01:21:55,990 --> 01:21:56,000
communication satellites
 

4797
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:59,030
communication satellites
oh wow so that is a close call

4798
01:21:59,030 --> 01:21:59,040
oh wow so that is a close call
 

4799
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:01,270
oh wow so that is a close call
but people have studied it and then

4800
01:22:01,270 --> 01:22:01,280
but people have studied it and then
 

4801
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:02,629
but people have studied it and then
apparently you're very confident it's

4802
01:22:02,629 --> 01:22:02,639
apparently you're very confident it's
 

4803
01:22:02,639 --> 01:22:04,229
apparently you're very confident it's
not actually going to hit us but it was

4804
01:22:04,229 --> 01:22:04,239
not actually going to hit us but it was
 

4805
01:22:04,239 --> 01:22:04,870
not actually going to hit us but it was
gonna have to look

4806
01:22:04,870 --> 01:22:04,880
gonna have to look
 

4807
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:07,510
gonna have to look
into this because i i'm very sure i'm

4808
01:22:07,510 --> 01:22:07,520
into this because i i'm very sure i'm
 

4809
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:09,350
into this because i i'm very sure i'm
very sure what's gonna happen

4810
01:22:09,350 --> 01:22:09,360
very sure what's gonna happen
 

4811
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:12,709
very sure what's gonna happen
if an asteroid actually hits earth

4812
01:22:12,709 --> 01:22:12,719
if an asteroid actually hits earth
 

4813
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:16,070
if an asteroid actually hits earth
that the scientific community

4814
01:22:16,070 --> 01:22:16,080
that the scientific community
 

4815
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:21,669
that the scientific community
and government will confidently say

4816
01:22:21,669 --> 01:22:21,679
and government will confidently say
 

4817
01:22:21,679 --> 01:22:23,990
and government will confidently say
that we have nothing to worry about it's

4818
01:22:23,990 --> 01:22:24,000
that we have nothing to worry about it's
 

4819
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,149
that we have nothing to worry about it's
going to be a close call

4820
01:22:26,149 --> 01:22:26,159
going to be a close call
 

4821
01:22:26,159 --> 01:22:27,910
going to be a close call
and then last minute they'd be like

4822
01:22:27,910 --> 01:22:27,920
and then last minute they'd be like
 

4823
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:30,229
and then last minute they'd be like
there was a miscalculation

4824
01:22:30,229 --> 01:22:30,239
there was a miscalculation
 

4825
01:22:30,239 --> 01:22:31,990
there was a miscalculation
they're not lying it's just like the

4826
01:22:31,990 --> 01:22:32,000
they're not lying it's just like the
 

4827
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,910
they're not lying it's just like the
space of possibilities

4828
01:22:33,910 --> 01:22:33,920
space of possibilities
 

4829
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:35,110
space of possibilities
because it's very difficult to track

4830
01:22:35,110 --> 01:22:35,120
because it's very difficult to track
 

4831
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:37,110
because it's very difficult to track
these kinds of things and there's a lot

4832
01:22:37,110 --> 01:22:37,120
these kinds of things and there's a lot
 

4833
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:38,709
these kinds of things and there's a lot
of kind of

4834
01:22:38,709 --> 01:22:38,719
of kind of
 

4835
01:22:38,719 --> 01:22:40,310
of kind of
there's complexities involved in this

4836
01:22:40,310 --> 01:22:40,320
there's complexities involved in this
 

4837
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:41,830
there's complexities involved in this
there's a lot of uncertainties

i just something tells me that

4840
01:22:45,350 --> 01:22:45,360
i just something tells me that
 

4841
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:47,590
i just something tells me that
human civilization will end with we'll

4842
01:22:47,590 --> 01:22:47,600
human civilization will end with we'll
 

4843
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:49,350
human civilization will end with we'll
see it coming

4844
01:22:49,350 --> 01:22:49,360
see it coming
 

4845
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:51,669
see it coming
and then last minute there will be uh

4846
01:22:51,669 --> 01:22:51,679
and then last minute there will be uh
 

4847
01:22:51,679 --> 01:22:52,470
and then last minute there will be uh
oops

4848
01:22:52,470 --> 01:22:52,480
oops
 

4849
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:54,149
oops
well like we'll see it coming and we'll

4850
01:22:54,149 --> 01:22:54,159
well like we'll see it coming and we'll
 

4851
01:22:54,159 --> 01:22:55,830
well like we'll see it coming and we'll
be like no it's this is

4852
01:22:55,830 --> 01:22:55,840
be like no it's this is
 

4853
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:57,750
be like no it's this is
this is threatening but no problem no

4854
01:22:57,750 --> 01:22:57,760
this is threatening but no problem no
 

4855
01:22:57,760 --> 01:22:59,270
this is threatening but no problem no
problem and last minute it would be like

4856
01:22:59,270 --> 01:22:59,280
problem and last minute it would be like
 

4857
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:00,950
problem and last minute it would be like
oops that was a miscalculation

4858
01:23:00,950 --> 01:23:00,960
oops that was a miscalculation
 

4859
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:02,870
oops that was a miscalculation
and then it's all over in a matter of

4860
01:23:02,870 --> 01:23:02,880
and then it's all over in a matter of
 

4861
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:05,590
and then it's all over in a matter of
like a week

4862
01:23:05,590 --> 01:23:05,600

 

4863
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:09,189

uh is we're just very positive and

4864
01:23:09,189 --> 01:23:09,199
uh is we're just very positive and
 

4865
01:23:09,199 --> 01:23:10,229
uh is we're just very positive and
optimistic today

4866
01:23:10,229 --> 01:23:10,239
optimistic today

is there any chance that bruce willis

4868
01:23:12,070 --> 01:23:12,080
is there any chance that bruce willis
 

4869
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:13,510
is there any chance that bruce willis
can save us

4870
01:23:13,510 --> 01:23:13,520
can save us
 

4871
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:16,390
can save us
in the sense that from what you know

4872
01:23:16,390 --> 01:23:16,400
in the sense that from what you know
 

4873
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:18,830
in the sense that from what you know
about asteroids is there something that

4874
01:23:18,830 --> 01:23:18,840
about asteroids is there something that
 

4875
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:20,149
about asteroids is there something that
um

4876
01:23:20,149 --> 01:23:20,159
um
 

4877
01:23:20,159 --> 01:23:23,990
um
you can catch them early enough to uh

4878
01:23:23,990 --> 01:23:24,000
you can catch them early enough to uh
 

4879
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:28,709
you can catch them early enough to uh
change volcanic eruptions right

4880
01:23:28,709 --> 01:23:28,719
change volcanic eruptions right
 

4881
01:23:28,719 --> 01:23:30,950
change volcanic eruptions right
sort of drill put a nuclear weapon

4882
01:23:30,950 --> 01:23:30,960
sort of drill put a nuclear weapon
 

4883
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:32,149
sort of drill put a nuclear weapon
inside and

4884
01:23:32,149 --> 01:23:32,159
inside and
 

4885
01:23:32,159 --> 01:23:34,390
inside and
break up the asteroid or change its

4886
01:23:34,390 --> 01:23:34,400
break up the asteroid or change its
 

4887
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:36,950
break up the asteroid or change its
trajectory

4889
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:39,669

there is potential for that if you catch

4890
01:23:39,669 --> 01:23:39,679
there is potential for that if you catch
 

4891
01:23:39,679 --> 01:23:40,790
there is potential for that if you catch
it early enough

4892
01:23:40,790 --> 01:23:40,800
it early enough
 

4893
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:44,310
it early enough
in advance i think

4894
01:23:44,310 --> 01:23:44,320
in advance i think
 

4895
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:47,510
in advance i think
in theory if you knew

4896
01:23:47,510 --> 01:23:47,520
in theory if you knew
 

4897
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:52,709
in theory if you knew
five years in advance ibm um

4898
01:23:52,709 --> 01:23:52,719

 

4899
01:23:52,719 --> 01:23:54,950

depending on the object and how close

4900
01:23:54,950 --> 01:23:54,960
depending on the object and how close
 

4901
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:56,709
depending on the object and how close
how much you would need to deflect it

4902
01:23:56,709 --> 01:23:56,719
how much you would need to deflect it
 

4903
01:23:56,719 --> 01:24:00,550
how much you would need to deflect it
um you could deflect it a little bit

4904
01:24:00,550 --> 01:24:00,560
um you could deflect it a little bit
 

4905
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:02,950
um you could deflect it a little bit
i don't know that it would be sufficient

4906
01:24:02,950 --> 01:24:02,960
i don't know that it would be sufficient
 

4907
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:04,070
i don't know that it would be sufficient
in all cases

4908
01:24:04,070 --> 01:24:04,080
in all cases
 

4909
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:06,390
in all cases
um and this is definitely not my

4910
01:24:06,390 --> 01:24:06,400
um and this is definitely not my
 

4911
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:08,550
um and this is definitely not my
specific area of expertise but

4912
01:24:08,550 --> 01:24:08,560
specific area of expertise but
 

4913
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:10,470
specific area of expertise but
my understanding is that there is

4914
01:24:10,470 --> 01:24:10,480
my understanding is that there is
 

4915
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:12,390
my understanding is that there is
something you could do

4916
01:24:12,390 --> 01:24:12,400
something you could do
 

4917
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:15,189
something you could do
but it also how you would carry that out

4918
01:24:15,189 --> 01:24:15,199
but it also how you would carry that out
 

4919
01:24:15,199 --> 01:24:16,070
but it also how you would carry that out
depends a lot

4920
01:24:16,070 --> 01:24:16,080
depends a lot
 

4921
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:17,510
depends a lot
on the properties of the asteroid if

4922
01:24:17,510 --> 01:24:17,520
on the properties of the asteroid if
 

4923
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:19,990
on the properties of the asteroid if
it's a solid object versus a rubble pile

4924
01:24:19,990 --> 01:24:20,000
it's a solid object versus a rubble pile
 

4925
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:23,430
it's a solid object versus a rubble pile
so let's say you planted some bomb

4926
01:24:23,430 --> 01:24:23,440
so let's say you planted some bomb
 

4927
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:26,470
so let's say you planted some bomb
in the middle of it and it blew up but

4928
01:24:26,470 --> 01:24:26,480
in the middle of it and it blew up but
 

4929
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:28,229
in the middle of it and it blew up but
it was just kind of a pile of material

4930
01:24:28,229 --> 01:24:28,239
it was just kind of a pile of material
 

4931
01:24:28,239 --> 01:24:30,070
it was just kind of a pile of material
anyway and then that material comes back

4932
01:24:30,070 --> 01:24:30,080
anyway and then that material comes back
 

4933
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:31,669
anyway and then that material comes back
together and then you kind of just have

4934
01:24:31,669 --> 01:24:31,679
together and then you kind of just have
 

4935
01:24:31,679 --> 01:24:33,189
together and then you kind of just have
the same thing

4936
01:24:33,189 --> 01:24:33,199
the same thing
 

4937
01:24:33,199 --> 01:24:34,870
the same thing
presumably its trajectory would be

4938
01:24:34,870 --> 01:24:34,880
presumably its trajectory would be
 

4939
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:36,550
presumably its trajectory would be
altered but

4940
01:24:36,550 --> 01:24:36,560
altered but
 

4941
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:38,709
altered but
it's it's like terminator 2 when it's

4942
01:24:38,709 --> 01:24:38,719
it's it's like terminator 2 when it's
 

4943
01:24:38,719 --> 01:24:40,390
it's it's like terminator 2 when it's
like the thing that's just like

4944
01:24:40,390 --> 01:24:40,400
like the thing that's just like
 

4945
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:42,390
like the thing that's just like
you shoot it and splashes and then comes

4946
01:24:42,390 --> 01:24:42,400
you shoot it and splashes and then comes
 

4947
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:44,629
you shoot it and splashes and then comes
back together will be very useless

4948
01:24:44,629 --> 01:24:44,639
back together will be very useless
 

4949
01:24:44,639 --> 01:24:46,149
back together will be very useless
that's fascinating and what's

4950
01:24:46,149 --> 01:24:46,159
that's fascinating and what's
 

4951
01:24:46,159 --> 01:24:48,470
that's fascinating and what's
fascinating

4952
01:24:48,470 --> 01:24:48,480
fascinating
 

4953
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:51,669

millions of dollars and the final thing

5044
01:26:27,669 --> 01:26:27,679
millions of dollars and the final thing
 

5045
01:26:27,679 --> 01:26:29,430
millions of dollars and the final thing
is a highlight video on youtube of

5046
01:26:29,430 --> 01:26:29,440
is a highlight video on youtube of
 

5047
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:30,470
is a highlight video on youtube of
robots falling

5048
01:26:30,470 --> 01:26:30,480
robots falling
 

5049
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:32,629
robots falling
but they had a lot of trouble with

5050
01:26:32,629 --> 01:26:32,639
but they had a lot of trouble with
 

5051
01:26:32,639 --> 01:26:34,229
but they had a lot of trouble with
uneven surfaces that's basically you

5052
01:26:34,229 --> 01:26:34,239
uneven surfaces that's basically you
 

5053
01:26:34,239 --> 01:26:35,910
uneven surfaces that's basically you
have to do

5054
01:26:35,910 --> 01:26:35,920
have to do
 

5055
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:37,830
have to do
the challenge involves you're mostly

5056
01:26:37,830 --> 01:26:37,840
the challenge involves you're mostly
 

5057
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:39,189
the challenge involves you're mostly
autonomous with some

5058
01:26:39,189 --> 01:26:39,199
autonomous with some
 

5059
01:26:39,199 --> 01:26:41,350
autonomous with some
partial human communication but that

5060
01:26:41,350 --> 01:26:41,360
partial human communication but that
 

5061
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:43,110
partial human communication but that
human communication is broken up

5062
01:26:43,110 --> 01:26:43,120
human communication is broken up
 

5063
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:45,430
human communication is broken up
like you don't get a you get a noisy

5064
01:26:45,430 --> 01:26:45,440
like you don't get a you get a noisy
 

5065
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:46,550
like you don't get a you get a noisy
channel so you can

5066
01:26:46,550 --> 01:26:46,560
channel so you can
 

5067
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:48,950
channel so you can
humans can which is very similar to what

5068
01:26:48,950 --> 01:26:48,960
humans can which is very similar to what
 

5069
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:49,590
humans can which is very similar to what
it would be

5070
01:26:49,590 --> 01:26:49,600
it would be
 

5071
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:52,470
it would be
like in humans remotely operating a

5072
01:26:52,470 --> 01:26:52,480
like in humans remotely operating a
 

5073
01:26:52,480 --> 01:26:52,870
like in humans remotely operating a
thing

5074
01:26:52,870 --> 01:26:52,880
thing
 

5075
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:56,149
thing
on an asteroid and so with that robots

5076
01:26:56,149 --> 01:26:56,159
on an asteroid and so with that robots
 

5077
01:26:56,159 --> 01:26:57,110
on an asteroid and so with that robots
really struggle

5078
01:26:57,110 --> 01:26:57,120
really struggle
 

5079
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:59,750
really struggle
there's some hilarious painful videos of

5080
01:26:59,750 --> 01:26:59,760
there's some hilarious painful videos of
 

5081
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:00,870
there's some hilarious painful videos of
like a robot

5082
01:27:00,870 --> 01:27:00,880
like a robot
 

5083
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:03,350
like a robot
not able to like open the door and then

5084
01:27:03,350 --> 01:27:03,360
not able to like open the door and then
 

5085
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:05,590
not able to like open the door and then
it tries to open the door without like

5086
01:27:05,590 --> 01:27:05,600
it tries to open the door without like
 

5087
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:07,910
it tries to open the door without like
misses the handle and in doing so like

5088
01:27:07,910 --> 01:27:07,920
misses the handle and in doing so like
 

5089
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:09,430
misses the handle and in doing so like
falls

5090
01:27:09,430 --> 01:27:09,440
falls
 

5091
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:12,709
falls
it's um it's painful to watch so

5092
01:27:12,709 --> 01:27:12,719
it's um it's painful to watch so
 

5093
01:27:12,719 --> 01:27:14,709
it's um it's painful to watch so
like that there's that and then there's

5094
01:27:14,709 --> 01:27:14,719
like that there's that and then there's
 

5095
01:27:14,719 --> 01:27:17,669
like that there's that and then there's
spacex so i have hope from spacex

5096
01:27:17,669 --> 01:27:17,679
spacex so i have hope from spacex
 

5097
01:27:17,679 --> 01:27:19,270
spacex so i have hope from spacex
and then i have less hope from bipeda

5098
01:27:19,270 --> 01:27:19,280
and then i have less hope from bipeda
 

5099
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:21,350
and then i have less hope from bipeda
robotics

5100

robotics
 

5101
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:23,669
robotics
but it's fun it's fun to kind of imagine

5102
01:27:23,669 --> 01:27:23,679
but it's fun it's fun to kind of imagine
 

5103
01:27:23,679 --> 01:27:25,189
but it's fun it's fun to kind of imagine
and i think the planetary

5104
01:27:25,189 --> 01:27:25,199
and i think the planetary
 

5105
01:27:25,199 --> 01:27:27,030
and i think the planetary
side of it comes into play in

5106
01:27:27,030 --> 01:27:27,040
side of it comes into play in
 

5107
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:28,470
side of it comes into play in
understanding the surfaces of these

5108
01:27:28,470 --> 01:27:28,480
understanding the surfaces of these
 

5109
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:30,390
understanding the surfaces of these
asteroids more and more

because it feels like we're working with
 

5151

sure i i do see exploration going
 

5155
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:15,990
sure i i do see exploration going
that way i think um

5156

very low rate of failure but
 

5173
01:28:31,199 --> 01:28:35,189
very low rate of failure but
now that these sort of cubesat

they're they're very cheap and you know
 

5181
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:43,750
they're they're very cheap and you know
nasa is getting involved in this as well

nasa is getting involved in this as well
 

5183
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:45,030
nasa is getting involved in this as well
there's there's

5184
01:28:45,030 --> 01:28:45,040
there's there's
 

5185
01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:47,030
there's there's
a lot of interest in these missions that

5186
01:28:47,030 --> 01:28:47,040
a lot of interest in these missions that
 

5187
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:48,470
a lot of interest in these missions that
are relatively small

5188
01:28:48,470 --> 01:28:48,480
are relatively small
 

5189
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:50,470
are relatively small
relatively cheap and just do one thing

5190
01:28:50,470 --> 01:28:50,480
relatively cheap and just do one thing
 

5191
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:53,030
relatively cheap and just do one thing
so you can really optimize it to

5192
01:28:53,030 --> 01:28:53,040
so you can really optimize it to
 

5193
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:54,550
so you can really optimize it to
just do this one thing and maybe you

5194
01:28:54,550 --> 01:28:54,560
just do this one thing and maybe you
 

5195
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:56,149
just do this one thing and maybe you
could build 100 of them and send them to

5196
01:28:56,149 --> 01:28:56,159
could build 100 of them and send them to
 

5197
01:28:56,159 --> 01:28:57,510
could build 100 of them and send them to
different asteroids and they would just

5198
01:28:57,510 --> 01:28:57,520
different asteroids and they would just
 

5199
01:28:57,520 --> 01:28:59,270
different asteroids and they would just
collect this one piece of information

5200
01:28:59,270 --> 01:28:59,280
collect this one piece of information
 

5201

collect this one piece of information
from each asteroid

5202
01:29:00,870 --> 01:29:00,880
from each asteroid
 

5203
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:03,590
from each asteroid
it's a kind of different more

5204
01:29:03,590 --> 01:29:03,600
it's a kind of different more
 

5205
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:05,830
it's a kind of different more
distributed way of doing science i guess

5206
01:29:05,830 --> 01:29:05,840
distributed way of doing science i guess
 

5207
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:08,390
distributed way of doing science i guess
um and there's a ton of potential there

5208
01:29:08,390 --> 01:29:08,400
um and there's a ton of potential there
 

5209
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:10,950
um and there's a ton of potential there
i agree

5210
01:29:10,950 --> 01:29:10,960
i agree
 

5211
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:13,750
i agree
let me ask you about objects or one

5212
01:29:13,750 --> 01:29:13,760
let me ask you about objects or one
 

5213
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:15,110
let me ask you about objects or one
particular object from

5214
01:29:15,110 --> 01:29:15,120
particular object from
 

5215
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:17,750
particular object from
outside our solar system we don't get to

5216
01:29:17,750 --> 01:29:17,760
outside our solar system we don't get to
 

5217
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:19,510
outside our solar system we don't get to
study many of these right

5218
01:29:19,510 --> 01:29:19,520
study many of these right
 

5219
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:21,510
study many of these right
they don't we don't get stuff that just

5220
01:29:21,510 --> 01:29:21,520
they don't we don't get stuff that just
 

5221
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:23,110
they don't we don't get stuff that just
flies in out of nowhere

5222
01:29:23,110 --> 01:29:23,120
flies in out of nowhere
 

5223
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:25,030
flies in out of nowhere
from outside the solar system and flies

5224
01:29:25,030 --> 01:29:25,040
from outside the solar system and flies
 

5225
01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:27,830
from outside the solar system and flies
through apparently there's been two

5226
01:29:27,830 --> 01:29:27,840
through apparently there's been two
 

5227
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:30,550
through apparently there's been two
recently in the past few years one of

5228
01:29:30,550 --> 01:29:30,560
recently in the past few years one of
 

5229
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:31,510
recently in the past few years one of
them

is amor more what are your thoughts

5232
01:29:35,110 --> 01:29:35,120
is amor more what are your thoughts
 

5233
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:35,510
is amor more what are your thoughts
about

5234
01:29:35,510 --> 01:29:35,520
about
 

5235
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:39,189
about
amor more so fun to say

5236
01:29:39,189 --> 01:29:39,199
amor more so fun to say
 

5237
01:29:39,199 --> 01:29:41,270
amor more so fun to say
could it could it be space junk from a

5238
01:29:41,270 --> 01:29:41,280
could it could it be space junk from a
 

5239
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:43,510
could it could it be space junk from a
distant alien civilization or is it just

5240
01:29:43,510 --> 01:29:43,520
distant alien civilization or is it just
 

5241
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:47,590
distant alien civilization or is it just
a weird shaped comet

5242
01:29:47,590 --> 01:29:47,600

 

5243
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:50,709

i like the way that's freezed um so

5244
01:29:50,709 --> 01:29:50,719
i like the way that's freezed um so
 

5245
01:29:50,719 --> 01:29:53,590
i like the way that's freezed um so
umua is is a fascinating object just the

5246
01:29:53,590 --> 01:29:53,600
umua is is a fascinating object just the
 

5247
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:55,270
umua is is a fascinating object just the
fact that we have started discovering

5248
01:29:55,270 --> 01:29:55,280
fact that we have started discovering
 

5249
01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:56,070
fact that we have started discovering
things

5250
01:29:56,070 --> 01:29:56,080
things
 

5251
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:57,350
things
that are coming in from outside our

5252
01:29:57,350 --> 01:29:57,360
that are coming in from outside our
 

5253
01:29:57,360 --> 01:29:59,189
that are coming in from outside our
solar system is amazing

5254
01:29:59,189 --> 01:29:59,199
solar system is amazing
 

5255
01:29:59,199 --> 01:30:01,910
solar system is amazing
uh and can can start to study them and

5256
01:30:01,910 --> 01:30:01,920
uh and can can start to study them and
 

5257
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:02,870
uh and can can start to study them and
now that we have seen

5258
01:30:02,870 --> 01:30:02,880
now that we have seen
 

5259
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:06,390
now that we have seen
some we can

5260
01:30:06,390 --> 01:30:06,400
some we can
 

5261
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:09,110
some we can
design now kind of thinking in advance

5262
01:30:09,110 --> 01:30:09,120
design now kind of thinking in advance
 

5263
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:11,110
design now kind of thinking in advance
the next time we see one we will be much

5264
01:30:11,110 --> 01:30:11,120
the next time we see one we will be much
 

5265
01:30:11,120 --> 01:30:12,470
the next time we see one we will be much
more ready for it we will know which

5266
01:30:12,470 --> 01:30:12,480
more ready for it we will know which
 

5267
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:14,149
more ready for it we will know which
telescopes we want to point at it we

5268
01:30:14,149 --> 01:30:14,159
telescopes we want to point at it we
 

5269
01:30:14,159 --> 01:30:16,470
telescopes we want to point at it we
will have explored whether we could even

5270
01:30:16,470 --> 01:30:16,480
will have explored whether we could even
 

5271
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:18,310
will have explored whether we could even
launch a fast turnaround mission to

5272
01:30:18,310 --> 01:30:18,320
launch a fast turnaround mission to
 

5273
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:20,790
launch a fast turnaround mission to
actually like get to it before it leaves

5274
01:30:20,790 --> 01:30:20,800
actually like get to it before it leaves
 

5275
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:22,550
actually like get to it before it leaves
the solar system

5276
01:30:22,550 --> 01:30:22,560
the solar system
 

5277
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:26,709
the solar system
um in terms of a muammua yeah it's

5278
01:30:26,709 --> 01:30:26,719
um in terms of a muammua yeah it's
 

5279
01:30:26,719 --> 01:30:28,390
um in terms of a muammua yeah it's
for an object in our solar system it's

5280
01:30:28,390 --> 01:30:28,400
for an object in our solar system it's
 

5281
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:30,310
for an object in our solar system it's
really unusual

5282
01:30:30,310 --> 01:30:30,320
really unusual
 

5283
01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:33,510
really unusual
in two particular ways

5284
01:30:33,510 --> 01:30:33,520
in two particular ways
 

5285
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:36,310
in two particular ways
one is the dimensions that we don't see

5286
01:30:36,310 --> 01:30:36,320
one is the dimensions that we don't see
 

5287
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:37,830
one is the dimensions that we don't see
natural things in our solar system that

5288
01:30:37,830 --> 01:30:37,840
natural things in our solar system that
 

5289
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:38,390
natural things in our solar system that
are

5290
01:30:38,390 --> 01:30:38,400
are
 

5291
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:40,470
are
kind of long and skinny we see the

5292
01:30:40,470 --> 01:30:40,480
kind of long and skinny we see the
 

5293
01:30:40,480 --> 01:30:41,830
kind of long and skinny we see the
things we see in our solar system don't

5294
01:30:41,830 --> 01:30:41,840
things we see in our solar system don't
 

5295
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:43,750
things we see in our solar system don't
deviate from spherical by

5296
01:30:43,750 --> 01:30:43,760
deviate from spherical by
 

5297
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:46,870
deviate from spherical by
that much um and then that it showed

5298
01:30:46,870 --> 01:30:46,880
that much um and then that it showed
 

5299
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:48,310
that much um and then that it showed
these strange properties

5300
01:30:48,310 --> 01:30:48,320
these strange properties
 

5301
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:50,229
these strange properties
of accelerating as it was leaving the

5302
01:30:50,229 --> 01:30:50,239
of accelerating as it was leaving the
 

5303
01:30:50,239 --> 01:30:51,990
of accelerating as it was leaving the
solar system which was not understood at

5304
01:30:51,990 --> 01:30:52,000
solar system which was not understood at
 

5305
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:53,189
solar system which was not understood at
first

5306
01:30:53,189 --> 01:30:53,199
first
 

5307
01:30:53,199 --> 01:30:57,030
first
so in terms of the

5308
01:30:57,030 --> 01:30:57,040
so in terms of the
 

5309
01:30:57,040 --> 01:31:00,149
so in terms of the
alien space junk you know as a scientist

5310
01:31:00,149 --> 01:31:00,159
alien space junk you know as a scientist
 

5311
01:31:00,159 --> 01:31:03,270
alien space junk you know as a scientist
i cannot rule out that possibility i

5312
01:31:03,270 --> 01:31:03,280
i cannot rule out that possibility i
 

5313
01:31:03,280 --> 01:31:03,830
i cannot rule out that possibility i
have no

5314
01:31:03,830 --> 01:31:03,840
have no
 

5315
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:06,950
have no
evidence to the contrary um

5316
01:31:06,950 --> 01:31:06,960
evidence to the contrary um
 

5317
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:09,030
evidence to the contrary um
however so you're saying there's a

5318
01:31:09,030 --> 01:31:09,040
however so you're saying there's a
 

5319
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:10,470
however so you're saying there's a
chance

5320
01:31:10,470 --> 01:31:10,480
chance
 

5321
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:13,110
chance
i cannot i cannot as a scientist

5322
01:31:13,110 --> 01:31:13,120
i cannot i cannot as a scientist
 

5323
01:31:13,120 --> 01:31:15,510
i cannot i cannot as a scientist
honestly say that i can rule out

5324
01:31:15,510 --> 01:31:15,520
honestly say that i can rule out
 

5325
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:18,550
honestly say that i can rule out
that it's alien space junk however i i

5326
01:31:18,550 --> 01:31:18,560
that it's alien space junk however i i
 

5327
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:19,270
that it's alien space junk however i i
see

5328
01:31:19,270 --> 01:31:19,280
see
 

5329
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:22,470
see
the kind of alien explanation

5330
01:31:22,470 --> 01:31:22,480
the kind of alien explanation
 

5331
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:26,070
the kind of alien explanation
as following this uh the sagan's

5332
01:31:26,070 --> 01:31:26,080
as following this uh the sagan's
 

5333
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:27,350
as following this uh the sagan's
extraordinary claims

5334
01:31:27,350 --> 01:31:27,360
extraordinary claims
 

5335
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:29,350
extraordinary claims
require extraordinary evidence if you

5336
01:31:29,350 --> 01:31:29,360
require extraordinary evidence if you
 

5337
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:31,350
require extraordinary evidence if you
are going to actually claim that

5338
01:31:31,350 --> 01:31:31,360
are going to actually claim that
 

5339
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:32,709
are going to actually claim that
something is

5340
01:31:32,709 --> 01:31:32,719
something is
 

5341
01:31:32,719 --> 01:31:37,270
something is
aliens um you need to carefully evaluate

5342
01:31:37,270 --> 01:31:37,280
aliens um you need to carefully evaluate
 

5343
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:38,790
aliens um you need to carefully evaluate
one needs to carefully evaluate the

5344
01:31:38,790 --> 01:31:38,800
one needs to carefully evaluate the
 

5345
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:41,030
one needs to carefully evaluate the
other options and see whether

5346
01:31:41,030 --> 01:31:41,040
other options and see whether
 

5347
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:43,750
other options and see whether
it could just be something that we know

5348
01:31:43,750 --> 01:31:43,760
it could just be something that we know
 

5349
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:45,030
it could just be something that we know
exists that makes sense

5350
01:31:45,030 --> 01:31:45,040
exists that makes sense
 

5351
01:31:45,040 --> 01:31:48,470
exists that makes sense
in the case of a muammua

5352
01:31:48,470 --> 01:31:48,480

 

5353
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:51,510

there are explanations that fit well

5354
01:31:51,510 --> 01:31:51,520
there are explanations that fit well
 

5355
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:52,070
there are explanations that fit well
within

5356
01:31:52,070 --> 01:31:52,080
within
 

5357
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:54,229
within
our our understanding of how things work

5358
01:31:54,229 --> 01:31:54,239
our our understanding of how things work
 

5359
01:31:54,239 --> 01:31:55,669
our our understanding of how things work
so there are a couple

5360
01:31:55,669 --> 01:31:55,679
so there are a couple
 

5361
01:31:55,679 --> 01:31:58,390
so there are a couple
there are two hypotheses for what it

5362
01:31:58,390 --> 01:31:58,400
there are two hypotheses for what it
 

5363
01:31:58,400 --> 01:31:59,910
there are two hypotheses for what it
could be made of they're both

5364
01:31:59,910 --> 01:31:59,920
could be made of they're both
 

5365
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:02,310
could be made of they're both
both basically just ice shards in one

5366
01:32:02,310 --> 01:32:02,320
both basically just ice shards in one
 

5367
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:04,310
both basically just ice shards in one
case it's a nitrogen ice shard that came

5368
01:32:04,310 --> 01:32:04,320
case it's a nitrogen ice shard that came
 

5369
01:32:04,320 --> 01:32:05,910
case it's a nitrogen ice shard that came
off of something like pluto in another

5370
01:32:05,910 --> 01:32:05,920
off of something like pluto in another
 

5371
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:07,270
off of something like pluto in another
solar system

5372
01:32:07,270 --> 01:32:07,280
solar system
 

5373
01:32:07,280 --> 01:32:09,510
solar system
that pluto got hit with something and

5374
01:32:09,510 --> 01:32:09,520
that pluto got hit with something and
 

5375
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:11,030
that pluto got hit with something and
broke up into pieces and one of those

5376
01:32:11,030 --> 01:32:11,040
broke up into pieces and one of those
 

5377
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:13,189
broke up into pieces and one of those
pieces came through our solar system

5378
01:32:13,189 --> 01:32:13,199
pieces came through our solar system
 

5379
01:32:13,199 --> 01:32:17,110
pieces came through our solar system
in the other scenario it's a bit of a

5380
01:32:17,110 --> 01:32:17,120
in the other scenario it's a bit of a
 

5381
01:32:17,120 --> 01:32:20,550
in the other scenario it's a bit of a
failed solar system so our solar system

5382
01:32:20,550 --> 01:32:20,560
failed solar system so our solar system
 

5383
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:21,430
failed solar system so our solar system
formed out of a

5384
01:32:21,430 --> 01:32:21,440
formed out of a
 

5385
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:24,709
formed out of a
collapsing molecular cloud sometimes

5386
01:32:24,709 --> 01:32:24,719
collapsing molecular cloud sometimes
 

5387
01:32:24,719 --> 01:32:26,310
collapsing molecular cloud sometimes
those molecular clouds are not massive

5388
01:32:26,310 --> 01:32:26,320
those molecular clouds are not massive
 

5389
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:26,870
those molecular clouds are not massive
enough

5390
01:32:26,870 --> 01:32:26,880
enough
 

5391
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:29,590
enough
and they sort of collapse into bits but

5392
01:32:29,590 --> 01:32:29,600
and they sort of collapse into bits but
 

5393
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:31,270
and they sort of collapse into bits but
they don't actually form a solar system

5394
01:32:31,270 --> 01:32:31,280
they don't actually form a solar system
 

5395
01:32:31,280 --> 01:32:33,030
they don't actually form a solar system
but you end up with these kind of chunks

5396
01:32:33,030 --> 01:32:33,040
but you end up with these kind of chunks
 

5397
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:34,870
but you end up with these kind of chunks
of hydrogen ice apparently

5398
01:32:34,870 --> 01:32:34,880
of hydrogen ice apparently
 

5399
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:37,430
of hydrogen ice apparently
and so one of those chunks of hydrogen

5400
01:32:37,430 --> 01:32:37,440
and so one of those chunks of hydrogen
 

5401
01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:38,629
and so one of those chunks of hydrogen
ice could have got ejected and passed

5402
01:32:38,629 --> 01:32:38,639
ice could have got ejected and passed
 

5403
01:32:38,639 --> 01:32:39,669
ice could have got ejected and passed
through our solar system

5404
01:32:39,669 --> 01:32:39,679
through our solar system
 

5405
01:32:39,679 --> 01:32:43,189
through our solar system
so both cases explain

5406
01:32:43,189 --> 01:32:43,199
so both cases explain
 

5407
01:32:43,199 --> 01:32:45,590
so both cases explain
these properties in about the same way

5408
01:32:45,590 --> 01:32:45,600
these properties in about the same way
 

5409
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:46,390
these properties in about the same way
so

5410
01:32:46,390 --> 01:32:46,400
so
 

5411
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:48,950
so
those ices will sublimate once they've

5412
01:32:48,950 --> 01:32:48,960
those ices will sublimate once they've
 

5413
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:50,550
those ices will sublimate once they've
passed the sun and so as they're moving

5414
01:32:50,550 --> 01:32:50,560
passed the sun and so as they're moving
 

5415
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:52,229
passed the sun and so as they're moving
away from the sun you have the hydrogen

5416
01:32:52,229 --> 01:32:52,239
away from the sun you have the hydrogen
 

5417
01:32:52,239 --> 01:32:54,629
away from the sun you have the hydrogen
or nitrogen ice sublimating off

5418
01:32:54,629 --> 01:32:54,639
or nitrogen ice sublimating off
 

5419
01:32:54,639 --> 01:32:56,550
or nitrogen ice sublimating off
the sunward part of it and so that is

5420
01:32:56,550 --> 01:32:56,560
the sunward part of it and so that is
 

5421
01:32:56,560 --> 01:32:58,790
the sunward part of it and so that is
responsible for the acceleration

5422
01:32:58,790 --> 01:32:58,800
responsible for the acceleration
 

5423
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:01,510
responsible for the acceleration
the shape also because you have all this

5424
01:33:01,510 --> 01:33:01,520
the shape also because you have all this
 

5425
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:03,750
the shape also because you have all this
ice sublimating off the surface

5426
01:33:03,750 --> 01:33:03,760
ice sublimating off the surface
 

5427
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:06,550
ice sublimating off the surface
uh if you take something the the analogy

5428
01:33:06,550 --> 01:33:06,560
uh if you take something the the analogy
 

5429
01:33:06,560 --> 01:33:08,629
uh if you take something the the analogy
that um

5430
01:33:08,629 --> 01:33:08,639
that um
 

5431
01:33:08,639 --> 01:33:10,390
that um
works pretty well here is for a bar of

5432
01:33:10,390 --> 01:33:10,400
works pretty well here is for a bar of
 

5433
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:12,470
works pretty well here is for a bar of
soap your bar of soap

5434
01:33:12,470 --> 01:33:12,480
soap your bar of soap
 

5435
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:14,310
soap your bar of soap
starts out sort of close to spherical at

5436
01:33:14,310 --> 01:33:14,320
starts out sort of close to spherical at
 

5437
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:16,950
starts out sort of close to spherical at
least from a physicist's perspective

5438
01:33:16,950 --> 01:33:16,960
least from a physicist's perspective
 

5439
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:18,550
least from a physicist's perspective
and as you use it over time you

5440
01:33:18,550 --> 01:33:18,560
and as you use it over time you
 

5441
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:20,709
and as you use it over time you
eventually end up with this long thin

5442
01:33:20,709 --> 01:33:20,719
eventually end up with this long thin
 

5443
01:33:20,719 --> 01:33:23,510
eventually end up with this long thin
shard because it's been just by sort of

5444
01:33:23,510 --> 01:33:23,520
shard because it's been just by sort of
 

5445
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:24,229
shard because it's been just by sort of
weathering

5446
01:33:24,229 --> 01:33:24,239
weathering
 

5447
01:33:24,239 --> 01:33:26,000
weathering
as we would call it um

5448
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:26,010
as we would call it um
 

5449
01:33:26,010 --> 01:33:27,830
as we would call it um
[Music]

5450
01:33:27,830 --> 01:33:27,840
[Music]
 

5451
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:29,430
[Music]
and so in the same way if you just

5452
01:33:29,430 --> 01:33:29,440
and so in the same way if you just
 

5453
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:31,510
and so in the same way if you just
sublimate material off of one of these

5454
01:33:31,510 --> 01:33:31,520
sublimate material off of one of these
 

5455
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:33,110
sublimate material off of one of these
ice shards it ends up

5456
01:33:33,110 --> 01:33:33,120
ice shards it ends up
 

5457
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:35,030
ice shards it ends up
long and thin and it ends up

5458
01:33:35,030 --> 01:33:35,040
long and thin and it ends up
 

5459
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:36,790
long and thin and it ends up
accelerating out of the solar system

5460
01:33:36,790 --> 01:33:36,800
accelerating out of the solar system
 

5461
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:38,470
accelerating out of the solar system
and so given that these properties can

5462
01:33:38,470 --> 01:33:38,480
and so given that these properties can
 

5463
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:40,470
and so given that these properties can
be reasonably well explained that way

5464
01:33:40,470 --> 01:33:40,480
be reasonably well explained that way
 

5465
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:44,149
be reasonably well explained that way
um you know we should be

5466
01:33:44,149 --> 01:33:44,159
um you know we should be
 

5467
01:33:44,159 --> 01:33:45,910
um you know we should be
extremely skeptical about attributing

5468
01:33:45,910 --> 01:33:45,920
extremely skeptical about attributing
 

5469
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:47,189
extremely skeptical about attributing
things to

5470
01:33:47,189 --> 01:33:47,199
things to
 

5471
01:33:47,199 --> 01:33:49,990
things to
yeah aliens see the reason i like to

5472
01:33:49,990 --> 01:33:50,000
yeah aliens see the reason i like to
 

5473
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:51,990
yeah aliens see the reason i like to
think that it's aliens

5474
01:33:51,990 --> 01:33:52,000
think that it's aliens
 

5475
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,149
think that it's aliens
is because it puts a lot of priority on

5476
01:33:54,149 --> 01:33:54,159
is because it puts a lot of priority on
 

5477
01:33:54,159 --> 01:33:55,990
is because it puts a lot of priority on
us not being lazy

5478
01:33:55,990 --> 01:33:56,000
us not being lazy
 

5479
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,470
us not being lazy
and we need to catch this thing next

5480
01:33:58,470 --> 01:33:58,480
and we need to catch this thing next
 

5481
01:33:58,480 --> 01:33:59,910
and we need to catch this thing next
time it comes around

5482
01:33:59,910 --> 01:33:59,920
time it comes around
 

5483
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:02,310
time it comes around
i like the idea that there's objects not

5484
01:34:02,310 --> 01:34:02,320
i like the idea that there's objects not
 

5485
01:34:02,320 --> 01:34:03,350
i like the idea that there's objects not
like i

5486
01:34:03,350 --> 01:34:03,360
like i
 

5487
01:34:03,360 --> 01:34:05,350
like i
it's almost saddens me they they come

5488
01:34:05,350 --> 01:34:05,360
it's almost saddens me they they come
 

5489
01:34:05,360 --> 01:34:06,390
it's almost saddens me they they come
out of the darkness

5490
01:34:06,390 --> 01:34:06,400
out of the darkness
 

5491
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:09,110
out of the darkness
really fast they just fly by and go and

5492
01:34:09,110 --> 01:34:09,120
really fast they just fly by and go and
 

5493
01:34:09,120 --> 01:34:10,390
really fast they just fly by and go and
leave

5494
01:34:10,390 --> 01:34:10,400
leave
 

5495
01:34:10,400 --> 01:34:12,310
leave
it just seems like a wasted opportunity

5496
01:34:12,310 --> 01:34:12,320
it just seems like a wasted opportunity
 

5497
01:34:12,320 --> 01:34:14,310
it just seems like a wasted opportunity
not to study them

5498
01:34:14,310 --> 01:34:14,320
not to study them
 

5499
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:19,030
not to study them
it's like uh it's the easiest ways to do

5500
01:34:19,030 --> 01:34:19,040
it's like uh it's the easiest ways to do
 

5501
01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:21,430
it's like uh it's the easiest ways to do
space travel outside of the solar system

5502
01:34:21,430 --> 01:34:21,440
space travel outside of the solar system
 

5503
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:23,270
space travel outside of the solar system
it's having the things come to us

5504
01:34:23,270 --> 01:34:23,280
it's having the things come to us
 

5505
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:25,510
it's having the things come to us
right i like that way of putting it and

5506
01:34:25,510 --> 01:34:25,520
right i like that way of putting it and
 

5507
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:26,709
right i like that way of putting it and
like it would be nice to just

5508
01:34:26,709 --> 01:34:26,719
like it would be nice to just
 

5509
01:34:26,719 --> 01:34:29,990
like it would be nice to just
land on it like and first of all

5510
01:34:29,990 --> 01:34:30,000
land on it like and first of all
 

5511
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,950
land on it like and first of all
really importantly detect it early yes

5512
01:34:32,950 --> 01:34:32,960
really importantly detect it early yes
 

5513
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:34,870
really importantly detect it early yes
and then land on it

5514
01:34:34,870 --> 01:34:34,880
and then land on it
 

5515
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:37,990
and then land on it
like with a really nice

5516
01:34:37,990 --> 01:34:38,000
like with a really nice
 

5517
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,950
like with a really nice
like spacecraft and study the hell out

5518
01:34:40,950 --> 01:34:40,960
like spacecraft and study the hell out
 

5519
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:42,550
like spacecraft and study the hell out
of it

5520
01:34:42,550 --> 01:34:42,560
of it
 

5521
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:45,910
of it
and you know i because

5522
01:34:45,910 --> 01:34:45,920
and you know i because
 

5523
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:48,390
and you know i because
yeah it uh if there's a chance it's

5524
01:34:48,390 --> 01:34:48,400
yeah it uh if there's a chance it's
 

5525
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:49,669
yeah it uh if there's a chance it's
aliens

5526
01:34:49,669 --> 01:34:49,679
aliens
 

5527
01:34:49,679 --> 01:34:53,510
aliens
alien life it just feels like

5528
01:34:53,510 --> 01:34:53,520
alien life it just feels like
 

5529
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:57,270
alien life it just feels like
such a cheap way inexpensive way

5530
01:34:57,270 --> 01:34:57,280
such a cheap way inexpensive way
 

5531
01:34:57,280 --> 01:35:00,709
such a cheap way inexpensive way
to get information about alien life or

5532
01:35:00,709 --> 01:35:00,719
to get information about alien life or
 

5533
01:35:00,719 --> 01:35:01,270
to get information about alien life or
something

5534
01:35:01,270 --> 01:35:01,280
something
 

5535
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:03,350
something
interesting that's out there and i'm not

5536
01:35:03,350 --> 01:35:03,360
interesting that's out there and i'm not
 

5537
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:05,350
interesting that's out there and i'm not
sure if a nice shard from another

5538
01:35:05,350 --> 01:35:05,360
sure if a nice shard from another
 

5539
01:35:05,360 --> 01:35:08,229
sure if a nice shard from another
planetary system will be interesting but

5540
01:35:08,229 --> 01:35:08,239
planetary system will be interesting but
 

5541
01:35:08,239 --> 01:35:09,350
planetary system will be interesting but
it very well could be

5542
01:35:09,350 --> 01:35:09,360
it very well could be
 

5543
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:10,790
it very well could be
it could be totally new sets of

5544
01:35:10,790 --> 01:35:10,800
it could be totally new sets of
 

5545
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:12,470
it could be totally new sets of
materials it could be to tell us about

5546
01:35:12,470 --> 01:35:12,480
materials it could be to tell us about
 

5547
01:35:12,480 --> 01:35:13,350
materials it could be to tell us about
composition of

5548
01:35:13,350 --> 01:35:13,360
composition of
 

5549
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:16,390
composition of
of planets we don't quite understand

5550
01:35:16,390 --> 01:35:16,400
of planets we don't quite understand
 

5551
01:35:16,400 --> 01:35:17,990
of planets we don't quite understand
and it's just nice one especially in the

5552
01:35:17,990 --> 01:35:18,000
and it's just nice one especially in the
 

5553
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:19,669
and it's just nice one especially in the
case of a momoi i guess it was pretty

5554
01:35:19,669 --> 01:35:19,679
case of a momoi i guess it was pretty
 

5555
01:35:19,679 --> 01:35:20,790
case of a momoi i guess it was pretty
close to earth

5556
01:35:20,790 --> 01:35:20,800
close to earth
 

5557
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:23,510
close to earth
it would have been nice to uh to uh you

5558
01:35:23,510 --> 01:35:23,520
it would have been nice to uh to uh you
 

5559
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:25,510
it would have been nice to uh to uh you
know it's like

5560
01:35:25,510 --> 01:35:25,520
know it's like
 

5561
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:27,430
know it's like
don't go there they come to us i don't

5562
01:35:27,430 --> 01:35:27,440
don't go there they come to us i don't
 

5563
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:29,189
don't go there they come to us i don't
know that's what makes me

5564
01:35:29,189 --> 01:35:29,199
know that's what makes me
 

5565
01:35:29,199 --> 01:35:31,189
know that's what makes me
uh that that's what makes me quite a sad

5566
01:35:31,189 --> 01:35:31,199
uh that that's what makes me quite a sad
 

5567
01:35:31,199 --> 01:35:33,030
uh that that's what makes me quite a sad
it's a missed opportunity

5568
01:35:33,030 --> 01:35:33,040
it's a missed opportunity
 

5569
01:35:33,040 --> 01:35:35,270
it's a missed opportunity
well yeah and whether whether you think

5570
01:35:35,270 --> 01:35:35,280
well yeah and whether whether you think
 

5571
01:35:35,280 --> 01:35:36,629
well yeah and whether whether you think
it's aliens or not it's

5572
01:35:36,629 --> 01:35:36,639
it's aliens or not it's
 

5573
01:35:36,639 --> 01:35:38,709
it's aliens or not it's
it's a missed opportunity but you know

5574
01:35:38,709 --> 01:35:38,719
it's a missed opportunity but you know
 

5575
01:35:38,719 --> 01:35:40,149
it's a missed opportunity but you know
we weren't prepared and we will be

5576
01:35:40,149 --> 01:35:40,159
we weren't prepared and we will be
 

5577
01:35:40,159 --> 01:35:40,950
we weren't prepared and we will be
prepared for

5578
01:35:40,950 --> 01:35:40,960
prepared for
 

5579
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:44,229
prepared for
the next ones and um as

5580
01:35:44,229 --> 01:35:44,239
the next ones and um as
 

5581
01:35:44,239 --> 01:35:46,629
the next ones and um as
so there's been a movement in astronomy

5582
01:35:46,629 --> 01:35:46,639
so there's been a movement in astronomy
 

5583
01:35:46,639 --> 01:35:48,470
so there's been a movement in astronomy
more towards what's called time domain

5584
01:35:48,470 --> 01:35:48,480
more towards what's called time domain
 

5585
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:50,629
more towards what's called time domain
astronomy so kind of monitoring

5586
01:35:50,629 --> 01:35:50,639
astronomy so kind of monitoring
 

5587
01:35:50,639 --> 01:35:52,229
astronomy so kind of monitoring
the whole sky all the time at all

5588
01:35:52,229 --> 01:35:52,239
the whole sky all the time at all
 

5589
01:35:52,239 --> 01:35:53,830
the whole sky all the time at all
wavelengths that's kind of the goal and

5590
01:35:53,830 --> 01:35:53,840
wavelengths that's kind of the goal and
 

5591
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:55,669
wavelengths that's kind of the goal and
so we expect to detect

5592
01:35:55,669 --> 01:35:55,679
so we expect to detect
 

5593
01:35:55,679 --> 01:35:57,430
so we expect to detect
many more of these in the future even

5594
01:35:57,430 --> 01:35:57,440
many more of these in the future even
 

5595
01:35:57,440 --> 01:35:59,189
many more of these in the future even
though these were the first two we saw

5596
01:35:59,189 --> 01:35:59,199
though these were the first two we saw
 

5597
01:35:59,199 --> 01:36:00,950
though these were the first two we saw
our potential to detect them is only

5598
01:36:00,950 --> 01:36:00,960
our potential to detect them is only
 

5599
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:02,550
our potential to detect them is only
increasing with time and so there will

5600
01:36:02,550 --> 01:36:02,560
increasing with time and so there will
 

5601
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:03,590
increasing with time and so there will
be more

5602
01:36:03,590 --> 01:36:03,600
be more
 

5603
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:06,229
be more
opportunities and you know based on

5604
01:36:06,229 --> 01:36:06,239
opportunities and you know based on
 

5605
01:36:06,239 --> 01:36:08,470
opportunities and you know based on
these two we now can

5606
01:36:08,470 --> 01:36:08,480
these two we now can
 

5607
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:10,070
these two we now can
actually sit and think about what we'll

5608
01:36:10,070 --> 01:36:10,080
actually sit and think about what we'll
 

5609
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:11,750
actually sit and think about what we'll
do when the next one shows up

5610
01:36:11,750 --> 01:36:11,760
do when the next one shows up
 

5611
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:14,310
do when the next one shows up
i also what it made me realize i i know

5612
01:36:14,310 --> 01:36:14,320
i also what it made me realize i i know
 

5613
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:14,870
i also what it made me realize i i know
i didn't

5614
01:36:14,870 --> 01:36:14,880
i didn't
 

5615
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:16,790
i didn't
really think through this but it made me

5616
01:36:16,790 --> 01:36:16,800
really think through this but it made me
 

5617
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:19,350
really think through this but it made me
realize if there is alien civilizations

5618
01:36:19,350 --> 01:36:19,360
realize if there is alien civilizations
 

5619
01:36:19,360 --> 01:36:20,470
realize if there is alien civilizations
out there

5620
01:36:20,470 --> 01:36:20,480
out there
 

5621
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:22,790
out there
the thing we're most likely to see first

5622
01:36:22,790 --> 01:36:22,800
the thing we're most likely to see first
 

5623
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:24,550
the thing we're most likely to see first
would be space junk

5624
01:36:24,550 --> 01:36:24,560
would be space junk
 

5625
01:36:24,560 --> 01:36:28,149
would be space junk
my stupid understanding of it

5626
01:36:28,149 --> 01:36:28,159
my stupid understanding of it
 

5627
01:36:28,159 --> 01:36:32,629
my stupid understanding of it
the second would be really dumb kind of

5628
01:36:32,629 --> 01:36:32,639

 

5629
01:36:32,639 --> 01:36:33,990

you could think of maybe like relay

5630
01:36:33,990 --> 01:36:34,000
you could think of maybe like relay
 

5631
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,629
you could think of maybe like relay
nodes or something objects

5632
01:36:36,629 --> 01:36:36,639
nodes or something objects
 

5633
01:36:36,639 --> 01:36:40,229
nodes or something objects
that you need to have a whole lot of

5634
01:36:40,229 --> 01:36:40,239
that you need to have a whole lot of
 

5635
01:36:40,239 --> 01:36:42,629
that you need to have a whole lot of
for particular purposes of like space

5636
01:36:42,629 --> 01:36:42,639
for particular purposes of like space
 

5637
01:36:42,639 --> 01:36:44,070
for particular purposes of like space
travel and so on

5638
01:36:44,070 --> 01:36:44,080
travel and so on
 

5639
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:45,990
travel and so on
like uh speed limit signs or something i

5640
01:36:45,990 --> 01:36:46,000
like uh speed limit signs or something i
 

5641
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,990
like uh speed limit signs or something i
don't know whatever we have on earth a

5642
01:36:47,990 --> 01:36:48,000
don't know whatever we have on earth a
 

5643
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:49,109
don't know whatever we have on earth a
lot of

5644
01:36:49,109 --> 01:36:49,119
lot of
 

5645
01:36:49,119 --> 01:36:51,669
lot of
that's dumb it's not alien aliens in

5646
01:36:51,669 --> 01:36:51,679
that's dumb it's not alien aliens in
 

5647
01:36:51,679 --> 01:36:52,390
that's dumb it's not alien aliens in
themselves

5648
01:36:52,390 --> 01:36:52,400
themselves
 

5649
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:55,189
themselves
it's like artifacts that are useful to

5650
01:36:55,189 --> 01:36:55,199
it's like artifacts that are useful to
 

5651
01:36:55,199 --> 01:36:56,149
it's like artifacts that are useful to
the engineering

5652
01:36:56,149 --> 01:36:56,159
the engineering
 

5653
01:36:56,159 --> 01:36:57,590
the engineering
in the systems that are engineered by

5654
01:36:57,590 --> 01:36:57,600
in the systems that are engineered by
 

5655
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:00,550
in the systems that are engineered by
alien civilizations so like

5656
01:37:00,550 --> 01:37:00,560
alien civilizations so like
 

5657
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:03,750
alien civilizations so like
it would we would see a lot of stuff

5658
01:37:03,750 --> 01:37:03,760
it would we would see a lot of stuff
 

5659
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:05,350
it would we would see a lot of stuff
in terms of setting in terms of looking

5660
01:37:05,350 --> 01:37:05,360
in terms of setting in terms of looking
 

5661
01:37:05,360 --> 01:37:06,950
in terms of setting in terms of looking
for alien life and trying to communicate

5662
01:37:06,950 --> 01:37:06,960
for alien life and trying to communicate
 

5663
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:07,750
for alien life and trying to communicate
with it

5664
01:37:07,750 --> 01:37:07,760
with it
 

5665
01:37:07,760 --> 01:37:11,990
with it
maybe we should be looking not for like

5666
01:37:11,990 --> 01:37:12,000
maybe we should be looking not for like
 

5667
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:15,109
maybe we should be looking not for like
smart creatures

5668
01:37:15,109 --> 01:37:15,119
smart creatures
 

5669
01:37:15,119 --> 01:37:17,669
smart creatures
or systems to communicate with maybe we

5670
01:37:17,669 --> 01:37:17,679
or systems to communicate with maybe we
 

5671
01:37:17,679 --> 01:37:18,550
or systems to communicate with maybe we
should be

5672
01:37:18,550 --> 01:37:18,560
should be
 

5673
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:22,149
should be
looking for artifacts or even as dumb as

5674
01:37:22,149 --> 01:37:22,159
looking for artifacts or even as dumb as
 

5675
01:37:22,159 --> 01:37:25,350
looking for artifacts or even as dumb as
like space junk it just kind of reframed

5676
01:37:25,350 --> 01:37:25,360
like space junk it just kind of reframed
 

5677
01:37:25,360 --> 01:37:25,750
like space junk it just kind of reframed
my

5678
01:37:25,750 --> 01:37:25,760
my
 

5679
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:27,750
my
perspective of like what are we looking

5680
01:37:27,750 --> 01:37:27,760
perspective of like what are we looking
 

5681
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:28,790
perspective of like what are we looking
for as signs

5682
01:37:28,790 --> 01:37:28,800
for as signs
 

5683
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:31,590
for as signs
is there there could be a lot of stuff

5684
01:37:31,590 --> 01:37:31,600
is there there could be a lot of stuff
 

5685
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:33,350
is there there could be a lot of stuff
that doesn't have intelligence but gives

5686
01:37:33,350 --> 01:37:33,360
that doesn't have intelligence but gives
 

5687
01:37:33,360 --> 01:37:34,149
that doesn't have intelligence but gives
us really strong

5688
01:37:34,149 --> 01:37:34,159
us really strong
 

5689
01:37:34,159 --> 01:37:36,229
us really strong
signs that there's somewhere is life or

5690
01:37:36,229 --> 01:37:36,239
signs that there's somewhere is life or
 

5691
01:37:36,239 --> 01:37:37,510
signs that there's somewhere is life or
intelligent life

5692
01:37:37,510 --> 01:37:37,520
intelligent life
 

5693
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:41,350
intelligent life
and um yeah that made me kind of

5694
01:37:41,350 --> 01:37:41,360
and um yeah that made me kind of
 

5695
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:43,510
and um yeah that made me kind of
i know it might be dumb to say but

5696
01:37:43,510 --> 01:37:43,520
i know it might be dumb to say but
 

5697
01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:45,109
i know it might be dumb to say but
reframe the kind of thing that we should

5698
01:37:45,109 --> 01:37:45,119
reframe the kind of thing that we should
 

5699
01:37:45,119 --> 01:37:47,189
reframe the kind of thing that we should
be looking for

5700
01:37:47,189 --> 01:37:47,199
be looking for
 

5701
01:37:47,199 --> 01:37:50,310
be looking for
yeah it's so the the benefit of looking

5702
01:37:50,310 --> 01:37:50,320
yeah it's so the the benefit of looking
 

5703
01:37:50,320 --> 01:37:52,310
yeah it's so the the benefit of looking
for intelligent life is that we perhaps

5704
01:37:52,310 --> 01:37:52,320
for intelligent life is that we perhaps
 

5705
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:55,030
for intelligent life is that we perhaps
have a better chance of recognizing it

5706
01:37:55,030 --> 01:37:55,040
have a better chance of recognizing it
 

5707
01:37:55,040 --> 01:37:57,109
have a better chance of recognizing it
um yeah we couldn't necessarily

5708
01:37:57,109 --> 01:37:57,119
um yeah we couldn't necessarily
 

5709
01:37:57,119 --> 01:37:58,950
um yeah we couldn't necessarily
recognize what an alien stop sign look

5710
01:37:58,950 --> 01:37:58,960
recognize what an alien stop sign look
 

5711
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:00,470
recognize what an alien stop sign look
like

5712
01:38:00,470 --> 01:38:00,480
like
 

5713
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:02,629
like
um that's true and maybe you know the

5714
01:38:02,629 --> 01:38:02,639
um that's true and maybe you know the
 

5715
01:38:02,639 --> 01:38:03,830
um that's true and maybe you know the
the theorists are

5716
01:38:03,830 --> 01:38:03,840
the theorists are
 

5717
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:05,350
the theorists are
the people who sort of model and try to

5718
01:38:05,350 --> 01:38:05,360
the people who sort of model and try to
 

5719
01:38:05,360 --> 01:38:07,750
the people who sort of model and try to
understand solar system objects are

5720
01:38:07,750 --> 01:38:07,760
understand solar system objects are
 

5721
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:09,510
understand solar system objects are
are pretty good at coming up with models

5722
01:38:09,510 --> 01:38:09,520
are pretty good at coming up with models
 

5723
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:11,669
are pretty good at coming up with models
for anything i mean if maybe umua was a

5724
01:38:11,669 --> 01:38:11,679
for anything i mean if maybe umua was a
 

5725
01:38:11,679 --> 01:38:12,790
for anything i mean if maybe umua was a
stop sign

5726
01:38:12,790 --> 01:38:12,800
stop sign
 

5727
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:15,109
stop sign
but we're clever enough that we could

5728
01:38:15,109 --> 01:38:15,119
but we're clever enough that we could
 

5729
01:38:15,119 --> 01:38:16,070
but we're clever enough that we could
come up with

5730
01:38:16,070 --> 01:38:16,080
come up with
 

5731
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:18,149
come up with
some physical explanations for it and

5732
01:38:18,149 --> 01:38:18,159
some physical explanations for it and
 

5733
01:38:18,159 --> 01:38:19,830
some physical explanations for it and
then you know we all want to go with the

5734
01:38:19,830 --> 01:38:19,840
then you know we all want to go with the
 

5735
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:21,189
then you know we all want to go with the
simplest possible

5736
01:38:21,189 --> 01:38:21,199
simplest possible
 

5737
01:38:21,199 --> 01:38:22,870
simplest possible
we all want to believe the sort of most

5738
01:38:22,870 --> 01:38:22,880
we all want to believe the sort of most
 

5739
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:25,669
we all want to believe the sort of most
skeptical uh possible explanation and so

5740
01:38:25,669 --> 01:38:25,679
skeptical uh possible explanation and so
 

5741
01:38:25,679 --> 01:38:27,510
skeptical uh possible explanation and so
we missed it because we're too good at

5742
01:38:27,510 --> 01:38:27,520
we missed it because we're too good at
 

5743
01:38:27,520 --> 01:38:29,109
we missed it because we're too good at
coming up with alternate explanations

5744
01:38:29,109 --> 01:38:29,119
coming up with alternate explanations
 

5745
01:38:29,119 --> 01:38:31,510
coming up with alternate explanations
for things and it's such an outlier such

5746
01:38:31,510 --> 01:38:31,520
for things and it's such an outlier such
 

5747
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:33,590
for things and it's such an outlier such
a rare phenomenon that we can't

5748
01:38:33,590 --> 01:38:33,600
a rare phenomenon that we can't
 

5749
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:35,350
a rare phenomenon that we can't
we can't study you know a hundred or a

5750
01:38:35,350 --> 01:38:35,360
we can't study you know a hundred or a
 

5751
01:38:35,360 --> 01:38:37,030
we can't study you know a hundred or a
thousand of these objects we have

5752
01:38:37,030 --> 01:38:37,040
thousand of these objects we have
 

5753
01:38:37,040 --> 01:38:39,590
thousand of these objects we have
we had just one and so the science

5754
01:38:39,590 --> 01:38:39,600
we had just one and so the science
 

5755
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:41,350
we had just one and so the science
almost destroys uh

5756
01:38:41,350 --> 01:38:41,360
almost destroys uh
 

5757
01:38:41,360 --> 01:38:42,870
almost destroys uh
the possibility of something special

5758
01:38:42,870 --> 01:38:42,880
the possibility of something special
 

5759
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:44,790
the possibility of something special
being there it's like a

5760
01:38:44,790 --> 01:38:44,800
being there it's like a
 

5761
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:46,790
being there it's like a

uh johnny ive this designer of apple i
 

5763
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:48,470
uh johnny ive this designer of apple i
don't know if you know who that is he's

5764
01:38:48,470 --> 01:38:48,480
don't know if you know who that is he's
 

5765
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:50,070
don't know if you know who that is he's
the lead designer he's the

5766
01:38:50,070 --> 01:38:50,080
the lead designer he's the
 

5767
01:38:50,080 --> 01:38:52,149
the lead designer he's the
person who designed the iphone and all

5768
01:38:52,149 --> 01:38:52,159
person who designed the iphone and all
 

5769
01:38:52,159 --> 01:38:53,430
person who designed the iphone and all
the major things

5770
01:38:53,430 --> 01:38:53,440
the major things
 

5771
01:38:53,440 --> 01:38:55,750
the major things
and he talked about he's brilliant one

5772
01:38:55,750 --> 01:38:55,760
and he talked about he's brilliant one
 

5773
01:38:55,760 --> 01:38:57,510
and he talked about he's brilliant one
of my favorite humans on earth

5774
01:38:57,510 --> 01:38:57,520
of my favorite humans on earth
 

5775
01:38:57,520 --> 01:38:59,189
of my favorite humans on earth
and one of the best designers in the

5776
01:38:59,189 --> 01:38:59,199
and one of the best designers in the
 

5777
01:38:59,199 --> 01:39:01,910
and one of the best designers in the
history of earth

5778
01:39:01,910 --> 01:39:01,920
history of earth
 

5779
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:04,070
history of earth
he talked about like when he had this

5780
01:39:04,070 --> 01:39:04,080
he talked about like when he had this
 

5781
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:05,350
he talked about like when he had this
origins of an idea

5782
01:39:05,350 --> 01:39:05,360
origins of an idea
 

5783
01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:07,510
origins of an idea
like in his baby stages he would not

5784
01:39:07,510 --> 01:39:07,520
like in his baby stages he would not
 

5785
01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:09,590
like in his baby stages he would not
tell steve jobs because steve would

5786
01:39:09,590 --> 01:39:09,600
tell steve jobs because steve would
 

5787
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:11,830
tell steve jobs because steve would
usually like trample all over it he

5788
01:39:11,830 --> 01:39:11,840
usually like trample all over it he
 

5789
01:39:11,840 --> 01:39:13,830
usually like trample all over it he
would say this is dumb idea

5790
01:39:13,830 --> 01:39:13,840
would say this is dumb idea
 

5791
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:15,030
would say this is dumb idea
and so i sometimes think of the

5792
01:39:15,030 --> 01:39:15,040
and so i sometimes think of the
 

5793
01:39:15,040 --> 01:39:16,790
and so i sometimes think of the
scientific community in that sense

5794
01:39:16,790 --> 01:39:16,800
scientific community in that sense
 

5795
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:17,990
scientific community in that sense
because

5796
01:39:17,990 --> 01:39:18,000
because
 

5797
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:21,189
because
the the weapon of the scientific method

5798
01:39:21,189 --> 01:39:21,199
the the weapon of the scientific method
 

5799
01:39:21,199 --> 01:39:22,550
the the weapon of the scientific method
is so strong

5800
01:39:22,550 --> 01:39:22,560
is so strong
 

5801
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:25,910
is so strong
at its best that it sometimes crushes

5802
01:39:25,910 --> 01:39:25,920
at its best that it sometimes crushes
 

5803
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:26,229
at its best that it sometimes crushes
the

5804
01:39:26,229 --> 01:39:26,239
the
 

5805
01:39:26,239 --> 01:39:30,149
the
out of the box outlier evidence

5806
01:39:30,149 --> 01:39:30,159
out of the box outlier evidence
 

5807
01:39:30,159 --> 01:39:31,590
out of the box outlier evidence
you know we don't get a lot of that

5808
01:39:31,590 --> 01:39:31,600
you know we don't get a lot of that
 

5809
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:33,910
you know we don't get a lot of that
evidence because we don't have um

5810
01:39:33,910 --> 01:39:33,920
evidence because we don't have um
 

5811
01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:35,430
evidence because we don't have um
we're not lucky enough to have a lot of

5812
01:39:35,430 --> 01:39:35,440
we're not lucky enough to have a lot of
 

5813
01:39:35,440 --> 01:39:36,950
we're not lucky enough to have a lot of
evidence so we have to deal with just

5814
01:39:36,950 --> 01:39:36,960
evidence so we have to deal with just
 

5815
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:40,070
evidence so we have to deal with just
special cases and special cases could

5816
01:39:40,070 --> 01:39:40,080
special cases and special cases could
 

5817
01:39:40,080 --> 01:39:43,510
special cases and special cases could
present an inkling of something much

5818
01:39:43,510 --> 01:39:43,520
present an inkling of something much
 

5819
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:44,310
present an inkling of something much
bigger

5820
01:39:44,310 --> 01:39:44,320
bigger
 

5821
01:39:44,320 --> 01:39:46,229
bigger
but the scientific method user tramples

5822
01:39:46,229 --> 01:39:46,239
but the scientific method user tramples
 

5823
01:39:46,239 --> 01:39:47,990
but the scientific method user tramples
all over and it's hard to know what to

5824
01:39:47,990 --> 01:39:48,000
all over and it's hard to know what to
 

5825
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:48,629
all over and it's hard to know what to
do

5826
01:39:48,629 --> 01:39:48,639
do
 

5827
01:39:48,639 --> 01:39:51,109
do
with that because the scientific method

5828
01:39:51,109 --> 01:39:51,119
with that because the scientific method
 

5829
01:39:51,119 --> 01:39:51,910
with that because the scientific method
works

5830
01:39:51,910 --> 01:39:51,920
works
 

5831
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:53,510
works
but at the same time every once in a

5832
01:39:53,510 --> 01:39:53,520
but at the same time every once in a
 

5833
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:55,030
but at the same time every once in a
while it's like a balance

5834
01:39:55,030 --> 01:39:55,040
while it's like a balance
 

5835
01:39:55,040 --> 01:39:57,109
while it's like a balance
you have to do 99 of the time you have

5836
01:39:57,109 --> 01:39:57,119
you have to do 99 of the time you have
 

5837
01:39:57,119 --> 01:39:59,510
you have to do 99 of the time you have
to do like scientific rigor

5838
01:39:59,510 --> 01:39:59,520
to do like scientific rigor
 

5839
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:01,030
to do like scientific rigor
but every once in a while this is not

5840
01:40:01,030 --> 01:40:01,040
but every once in a while this is not
 

5841
01:40:01,040 --> 01:40:02,550
but every once in a while this is not

smoke some weed and sit back and think

01:40:05,830 --> 01:40:05,840
smoke some weed and sit back and think
 

5845
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:08,870
smoke some weed and sit back and think
i wonder you know it's the joe rogan

01:40:08,870 --> 01:40:08,880
i wonder you know it's the joe rogan
 

5847
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:11,350
i wonder you know it's the joe rogan
thing it's entirely possible

5848
01:40:11,350 --> 01:40:11,360
thing it's entirely possible
 

5849
01:40:11,360 --> 01:40:14,390
thing it's entirely possible
that it's alien space junk

5850
01:40:14,390 --> 01:40:14,400
that it's alien space junk
 

5851
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:17,830
that it's alien space junk
anyway yeah i think so i i completely

5852
01:40:17,830 --> 01:40:17,840
anyway yeah i think so i i completely
 

5853
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:19,350
anyway yeah i think so i i completely
agree and i think that

5854
01:40:19,350 --> 01:40:19,360
agree and i think that
 

5855
01:40:19,360 --> 01:40:22,950
agree and i think that
most scientists do speculate about these

5856
01:40:22,950 --> 01:40:22,960
most scientists do speculate about these
 

5857
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:23,430
most scientists do speculate about these
things

5858
01:40:23,430 --> 01:40:23,440
things
 

5859
01:40:23,440 --> 01:40:26,070
things
it's just at what point do you act on

5860
01:40:26,070 --> 01:40:26,080
it's just at what point do you act on
 

5861
01:40:26,080 --> 01:40:27,189
it's just at what point do you act on
those things

5862
01:40:27,189 --> 01:40:27,199
those things
 

5863
01:40:27,199 --> 01:40:30,149
those things
um so you're right that the scientific

5864
01:40:30,149 --> 01:40:30,159
um so you're right that the scientific
 

5865
01:40:30,159 --> 01:40:32,149
um so you're right that the scientific
method has inherent skepticism and

5866
01:40:32,149 --> 01:40:32,159
method has inherent skepticism and
 

5867
01:40:32,159 --> 01:40:35,430
method has inherent skepticism and
for the most part that's a good thing

5868
01:40:35,430 --> 01:40:35,440
for the most part that's a good thing
 

5869
01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:37,030
for the most part that's a good thing
because it means that we're not just

5870
01:40:37,030 --> 01:40:37,040
because it means that we're not just
 

5871
01:40:37,040 --> 01:40:38,229
because it means that we're not just
believing

5872
01:40:38,229 --> 01:40:38,239
believing
 

5873
01:40:38,239 --> 01:40:42,790
believing
crazy things all the time but

5874
01:40:42,790 --> 01:40:42,800
crazy things all the time but
 

5875
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:45,990
crazy things all the time but
it's an interesting point that

5876
01:40:45,990 --> 01:40:46,000
it's an interesting point that
 

5877
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:49,109
it's an interesting point that
requiring that high level of of rigor

5878
01:40:49,109 --> 01:40:49,119
requiring that high level of of rigor
 

5879
01:40:49,119 --> 01:40:51,830
requiring that high level of of rigor
occasionally means that you will miss

5880
01:40:51,830 --> 01:40:51,840
occasionally means that you will miss
 

5881
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:53,030
occasionally means that you will miss
something that is

5882
01:40:53,030 --> 01:40:53,040
something that is
 

5883
01:40:53,040 --> 01:40:55,430
something that is
truly interesting because you needed to

5884
01:40:55,430 --> 01:40:55,440
truly interesting because you needed to
 

5885
01:40:55,440 --> 01:40:56,470
truly interesting because you needed to
verify it

5886
01:40:56,470 --> 01:40:56,480
verify it
 

5887
01:40:56,480 --> 01:40:58,709
verify it
three times and it wasn't verifiable i

5888
01:40:58,709 --> 01:40:58,719
three times and it wasn't verifiable i

something i don't talk much about

something i don't talk much about
 

5967
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,070
something i don't talk much about
because i don't like politics

because i don't like politics
 

5969

because i don't like politics
but we don't know if masks work but

5970
01:42:20,950 --> 01:42:20,960
but we don't know if masks work but
 

5971
01:42:20,960 --> 01:42:22,470
but we don't know if masks work but
there's a lot of evidence to show that

there's a lot of evidence to show that

there's a lot of evidence to show that
they work for this particular

the transmission of the virus is

the transmission of the virus is
fascinating actually the

fascinating actually the

but it's it's inspiring to to apply the
 

5991
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:40,470
but it's it's inspiring to to apply the

scientific message
 

5993

scientific message
to the best of our ability but also to

to the best of our ability but also to
 

5995
01:42:42,960 --> 01:42:44,229
to the best of our ability but also to
show that you don't always know

5996
01:42:44,229 --> 01:42:44,239
show that you don't always know
 

5997

as much but

as much but

01:42:55,990 --> 01:42:56,000
the best case
 

6009
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,390
the best case
and um because that's ultimately what we

6010
01:42:58,390 --> 01:42:58,400
and um because that's ultimately what we
 

6011
01:42:58,400 --> 01:42:59,830
and um because that's ultimately what we
are descendants of apes that are just

6012
01:42:59,830 --> 01:42:59,840
are descendants of apes that are just
 

6013
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:02,229
are descendants of apes that are just
curious about the world around us

6014
01:43:02,229 --> 01:43:02,239
curious about the world around us
 

6015
01:43:02,239 --> 01:43:05,030
curious about the world around us
yeah i uh i'll just add to that not on

6016
01:43:05,030 --> 01:43:05,040
yeah i uh i'll just add to that not on
 

6017
01:43:05,040 --> 01:43:07,189
yeah i uh i'll just add to that not on
the topic of masks but on the topic of

6018
01:43:07,189 --> 01:43:07,199
the topic of masks but on the topic of
 

6019
01:43:07,199 --> 01:43:09,189
the topic of masks but on the topic of
curiosity that's

6020
01:43:09,189 --> 01:43:09,199
curiosity that's
 

6021
01:43:09,199 --> 01:43:13,510
curiosity that's
um i mean i think that's

6022
01:43:13,510 --> 01:43:13,520
um i mean i think that's
 

6023
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:16,470
um i mean i think that's
astronomy and planetary sciences a field

6024
01:43:16,470 --> 01:43:16,480
astronomy and planetary sciences a field
 

6025
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:17,910
astronomy and planetary sciences a field
are

6026
01:43:17,910 --> 01:43:17,920
are
 

6027
01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:20,070
are
a little are are unique because for

6028
01:43:20,070 --> 01:43:20,080
a little are are unique because for
 

6029
01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:21,030
a little are are unique because for
better and

6030
01:43:21,030 --> 01:43:21,040
better and
 

6031
01:43:21,040 --> 01:43:23,990
better and
for worse they don't directly impact

6032
01:43:23,990 --> 01:43:24,000
for worse they don't directly impact
 

6033
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,229
for worse they don't directly impact
humanity

6034
01:43:26,229 --> 01:43:26,239
humanity
 

6035
01:43:26,239 --> 01:43:28,950
humanity
so you know we're not studying virology

6036
01:43:28,950 --> 01:43:28,960
so you know we're not studying virology
 

6037
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:29,350
so you know we're not studying virology
to

6038
01:43:29,350 --> 01:43:29,360
to
 

6039
01:43:29,360 --> 01:43:33,030
to
to prevent transmission of um

6040
01:43:33,030 --> 01:43:33,040
to prevent transmission of um
 

6041
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:35,430
to prevent transmission of um
you know illness amongst humans we're

6042
01:43:35,430 --> 01:43:35,440
you know illness amongst humans we're
 

6043
01:43:35,440 --> 01:43:36,830
you know illness amongst humans we're
not

6044
01:43:36,830 --> 01:43:36,840
not
 

6045
01:43:36,840 --> 01:43:38,709
not
characterizing volcanoes on earth that

6046
01:43:38,709 --> 01:43:38,719
characterizing volcanoes on earth that
 

6047
01:43:38,719 --> 01:43:42,470
characterizing volcanoes on earth that
could destroy cities we and it really is

6048
01:43:42,470 --> 01:43:42,480
could destroy cities we and it really is
 

6049
01:43:42,480 --> 01:43:46,070
could destroy cities we and it really is
a more curious and in my opinion playful

6050
01:43:46,070 --> 01:43:46,080
a more curious and in my opinion playful
 

6051
01:43:46,080 --> 01:43:49,189
a more curious and in my opinion playful
scientific field than many um

6052
01:43:49,189 --> 01:43:49,199
scientific field than many um
 

6053
01:43:49,199 --> 01:43:51,030
scientific field than many um
yeah so for better and worse we can kind

6054
01:43:51,030 --> 01:43:51,040
yeah so for better and worse we can kind
 

6055
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:52,870
yeah so for better and worse we can kind
of afford to pursue some of the

6056
01:43:52,870 --> 01:43:52,880
of afford to pursue some of the
 

6057
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:54,870
of afford to pursue some of the
speculation more because

6058
01:43:54,870 --> 01:43:54,880
speculation more because
 

6059
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:57,270
speculation more because
human lives are not in danger if we

6060
01:43:57,270 --> 01:43:57,280
human lives are not in danger if we
 

6061
01:43:57,280 --> 01:43:59,270
human lives are not in danger if we
speculate a little bit too freely

6062
01:43:59,270 --> 01:43:59,280
speculate a little bit too freely
 

6063
01:43:59,280 --> 01:44:03,350
speculate a little bit too freely
and get something wrong yeah definitely

6064
01:44:03,350 --> 01:44:03,360
and get something wrong yeah definitely
 

6065
01:44:03,360 --> 01:44:05,669
and get something wrong yeah definitely
in the space of ai i am worried that

6066
01:44:05,669 --> 01:44:05,679
in the space of ai i am worried that
 

6067
01:44:05,679 --> 01:44:08,149
in the space of ai i am worried that
we're sometimes too eager

6068
01:44:08,149 --> 01:44:08,159
we're sometimes too eager
 

6069
01:44:08,159 --> 01:44:11,430
we're sometimes too eager
speaking for myself to uh like flip

6070
01:44:11,430 --> 01:44:11,440
speaking for myself to uh like flip
 

6071
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:13,669
speaking for myself to uh like flip
the switch to on just to see like what

6072
01:44:13,669 --> 01:44:13,679
the switch to on just to see like what
 

6073
01:44:13,679 --> 01:44:15,830
the switch to on just to see like what
happens uh maybe sometimes we want to be

6074
01:44:15,830 --> 01:44:15,840
happens uh maybe sometimes we want to be
 

6075
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:17,510
happens uh maybe sometimes we want to be
a little bit careful about that

6076
01:44:17,510 --> 01:44:17,520
a little bit careful about that
 

6077
01:44:17,520 --> 01:44:21,030
a little bit careful about that
because uh bad things might happen

6078
01:44:21,030 --> 01:44:21,040
because uh bad things might happen
 

6079

and you get part way through it before
 

6165
01:45:59,920 --> 01:46:01,350
and you get part way through it before
realizing that the whole thing is

system and i love
 

6495
01:52:20,080 --> 01:52:22,070
system and i love
telescopes and i love doing data

6496
01:52:22,070 --> 01:52:22,080
telescopes and i love doing data
 

6497
01:52:22,080 --> 01:52:23,350
telescopes and i love doing data
analysis playing with data from

6498
01:52:23,350 --> 01:52:23,360
analysis playing with data from
 

6499
01:52:23,360 --> 01:52:24,870
analysis playing with data from
telescopes coming up with new ways to

6500
01:52:24,870 --> 01:52:24,880
telescopes coming up with new ways to
 

6501
01:52:24,880 --> 01:52:26,390
telescopes coming up with new ways to
use telescopes and so that's where i

6502
01:52:26,390 --> 01:52:26,400
use telescopes and so that's where i
 

6503
01:52:26,400 --> 01:52:27,589
use telescopes and so that's where i
have found that

6504
01:52:27,589 --> 01:52:27,599
have found that
 

6505
01:52:27,599 --> 01:52:30,470
have found that
mesh but if i was interested in you know

6506
01:52:30,470 --> 01:52:30,480
mesh but if i was interested in you know
 

6507
01:52:30,480 --> 01:52:32,229
mesh but if i was interested in you know
the dynamical evolution of the solar

6508
01:52:32,229 --> 01:52:32,239
the dynamical evolution of the solar
 

6509
01:52:32,239 --> 01:52:33,830
the dynamical evolution of the solar
system how the orbits of things evolve

6510
01:52:33,830 --> 01:52:33,840
system how the orbits of things evolve
 

6511
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:35,589
system how the orbits of things evolve
then i would need to do a different

6512
01:52:35,589 --> 01:52:35,599
then i would need to do a different
 

6513
01:52:35,599 --> 01:52:37,589
then i would need to do a different
type of work that i would just not find

6514
01:52:37,589 --> 01:52:37,599
type of work that i would just not find
 

6515
01:52:37,599 --> 01:52:39,109
type of work that i would just not find
as appealing and so it just wouldn't be

6516
01:52:39,109 --> 01:52:39,119
as appealing and so it just wouldn't be
 

6517
01:52:39,119 --> 01:52:40,390
as appealing and so it just wouldn't be
a good fit and so

6518
01:52:40,390 --> 01:52:40,400
a good fit and so
 

6519
01:52:40,400 --> 01:52:42,950
a good fit and so
it sort of is seems like an unromantic

6520
01:52:42,950 --> 01:52:42,960
it sort of is seems like an unromantic
 

6521
01:52:42,960 --> 01:52:44,470
it sort of is seems like an unromantic
thing to have to think about the

techniques being the thing you want to
 

6525
01:52:45,760 --> 01:52:47,750
techniques being the thing you want to
work on also but it really makes

david foster wallace said that uh the
 

6543
01:53:02,719 --> 01:53:06,229
david foster wallace said that uh the
key to life is to be unborable

6544
01:53:06,229 --> 01:53:06,239
key to life is to be unborable
 

6545
01:53:06,239 --> 01:53:08,550
key to life is to be unborable
so basically everything should be

6546
01:53:08,550 --> 01:53:08,560
so basically everything should be
 

6547

6551
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:13,109
i don't think that's feasible but you
should find an area where

6552
01:53:13,109 --> 01:53:13,119
should find an area where
 

6553
01:53:13,119 --> 01:53:15,750
should find an area where
everything is exciting i mean depending

6554
01:53:15,750 --> 01:53:15,760

the like activity of it
 

6669
01:55:23,440 --> 01:55:26,229
the like activity of it
endows it with more like meaning to me

6670
01:55:26,229 --> 01:55:26,239
endows it with more like meaning to me
