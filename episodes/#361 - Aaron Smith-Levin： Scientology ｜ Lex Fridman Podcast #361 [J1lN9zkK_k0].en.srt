the non-confidential levels there's just

168
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:15,180
the non-confidential levels there's just
 

169
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,330
the non-confidential levels there's just
one thing in per body

170
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:17,340
one thing in per body
 

171
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,190
one thing in per body
well I mean it's an interesting idea I

172
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:19,200
well I mean it's an interesting idea I
 

173
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,369
well I mean it's an interesting idea I
just would like to kind of explore

174
00:03:21,369 --> 00:03:21,379
just would like to kind of explore
 

175
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:23,809
just would like to kind of explore
the philosophy of that so there's a

176
00:03:23,809 --> 00:03:23,819
the philosophy of that so there's a
 

177
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:25,309
the philosophy of that so there's a
being that's all powerful that's

178
00:03:25,309 --> 00:03:25,319
being that's all powerful that's
 

179
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:26,570
being that's all powerful that's
immortal

180
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:26,580
immortal
 

181
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,570
immortal
and its projectionist manifestation on

182
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:29,580
and its projectionist manifestation on
 

183
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,830
and its projectionist manifestation on
this Earth is

184
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:30,840
this Earth is
 

185
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,630
this Earth is
fundamentally Limited

186
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:32,640
fundamentally Limited
 

187
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,970
fundamentally Limited
and you're trying to uh the process of

188
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:34,980
and you're trying to uh the process of
 

189
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:38,089
and you're trying to uh the process of
Scientology is the process of letting go

190
00:03:38,089 --> 00:03:38,099
Scientology is the process of letting go
 

191
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:39,589
Scientology is the process of letting go
of those limitations

192
00:03:39,589 --> 00:03:39,599
of those limitations
 

193
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,570
of those limitations
you know that's an interesting idea I

194
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:41,580
you know that's an interesting idea I
 

195
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,130
you know that's an interesting idea I
mean a lot of religions have this kind

196
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:43,140
mean a lot of religions have this kind
 

197
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,410
mean a lot of religions have this kind
of idea that there's a not just

198
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:45,420
of idea that there's a not just
 

199
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:48,289
of idea that there's a not just
religions but like we have the capacity

200
00:03:48,289 --> 00:03:48,299
religions but like we have the capacity
 

201
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:50,809
religions but like we have the capacity
as human beings to do to achieve

202
00:03:50,809 --> 00:03:50,819
as human beings to do to achieve
 

203
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:52,729
as human beings to do to achieve
greatness in all kinds of ways yeah and

204
00:03:52,729 --> 00:03:52,739
greatness in all kinds of ways yeah and
 

205
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:54,289
greatness in all kinds of ways yeah and
that's the question we have with our

206
00:03:54,289 --> 00:03:54,299
that's the question we have with our
 

207
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:55,789
that's the question we have with our
cognitive abilities we start with the

208
00:03:55,789 --> 00:03:55,799
cognitive abilities we start with the
 

209
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:57,410
cognitive abilities we start with the
embryo and build up and into this

210
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:57,420
embryo and build up and into this
 

211
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,449
embryo and build up and into this
organism and like this world of

212
00:03:59,449 --> 00:03:59,459
organism and like this world of
 

213
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:01,190
organism and like this world of
opportunities before us what are we

214
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:01,200
opportunities before us what are we
 

215
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,890
opportunities before us what are we
capable of and the idea that we're

216
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:03,900
capable of and the idea that we're
 

217
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,449
capable of and the idea that we're
capable of almost anything is a really

218
00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:05,459
capable of almost anything is a really
 

219
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:06,770
capable of almost anything is a really
powerful one and there's a lot of

220
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:06,780
powerful one and there's a lot of
 

221
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,570
powerful one and there's a lot of
religions there's a lot of philosophies

222
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:08,580
religions there's a lot of philosophies
 

223
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:12,170
religions there's a lot of philosophies
there's a lot of advice self-help that

224
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:12,180
there's a lot of advice self-help that
 

225
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,750
there's a lot of advice self-help that
kind of explores those ideas and so in

226
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:14,760
kind of explores those ideas and so in
 

227
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,789
kind of explores those ideas and so in
it seems like with Scientology this the

228
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:16,799
it seems like with Scientology this the
 

229
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:18,050
it seems like with Scientology this the
application of these religious

230
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:18,060
application of these religious
 

231
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,449
application of these religious
philosophy means that there's we're

232
00:04:20,449 --> 00:04:20,459
philosophy means that there's we're
 

233
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:22,490
philosophy means that there's we're
limited and we have to break through

234
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:22,500
limited and we have to break through
 

235
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,350
limited and we have to break through
those limitations and there's a process

236
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:24,360
those limitations and there's a process
 

237
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,150
those limitations and there's a process
to break through those limitations that

238
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:26,160
to break through those limitations that
 

239
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,730
to break through those limitations that
would be correct so what can make it

240
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:28,740
would be correct so what can make it
 

241
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,469
would be correct so what can make it
challenging to

242
00:04:30,469 --> 00:04:30,479
challenging to
 

243
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,710
challenging to
adequately and completely describe

244
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:33,720
adequately and completely describe
 

245
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,629
adequately and completely describe
Scientology in the beginning is what

246
00:04:35,629 --> 00:04:35,639
Scientology in the beginning is what
 

247
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:37,790
Scientology in the beginning is what
scientologists believe actually changes

248
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:37,800
scientologists believe actually changes
 

249
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,390
scientologists believe actually changes
as they progress further into or further

250
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:41,400
as they progress further into or further
 

251
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,730
as they progress further into or further
up in Scientology

252
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:43,740
up in Scientology
 

253
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,110
up in Scientology
so

254
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:45,120
so
 

255
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,670
so
um the explanation is I've given it is

256
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:46,680
um the explanation is I've given it is
 

257
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,810
um the explanation is I've given it is
pretty consistent with what you would

258
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:47,820
pretty consistent with what you would
 

259
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,790
pretty consistent with what you would
get at the lowest levels right

260
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:49,800
get at the lowest levels right
 

261
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,189
get at the lowest levels right
urethane I'm a thetan everyone's a

and we have a reactive mind

and we have a reactive mind
I'll run Hubbard would say the reactive

00:04:59,390 --> 00:04:59,400
I'll run Hubbard would say the reactive
 

269
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,909
I'll run Hubbard would say the reactive

the subconscious mind
 

279
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,610
the subconscious mind
uh it's always recording in moments of

280
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:13,620
uh it's always recording in moments of
 

281
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,890
uh it's always recording in moments of
pain and unconsciousness and that these

282
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:15,900
pain and unconsciousness and that these
 

283
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,810
pain and unconsciousness and that these
are called these recordings are Ron

284
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:17,820
are called these recordings are Ron
 

285
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,969
are called these recordings are Ron
Hubbard called them engrams now when L

286
00:05:19,969 --> 00:05:19,979
Hubbard called them engrams now when L
 

287
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:21,590
Hubbard called them engrams now when L
Ron Hubbard first wrote Dianetics in

288
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:21,600
Ron Hubbard first wrote Dianetics in
 

289
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,570
Ron Hubbard first wrote Dianetics in
1950 this was before Scientology came

290
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:23,580
1950 this was before Scientology came
 

291
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,790
1950 this was before Scientology came
along a couple years later right so in

292
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:25,800
along a couple years later right so in
 

293
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,890
along a couple years later right so in
1950 when he wrote Dianetics

294
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:27,900
1950 when he wrote Dianetics
 

295
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,490
1950 when he wrote Dianetics
it wasn't a spiritual Endeavor it was

296
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:31,500
it wasn't a spiritual Endeavor it was
 

297
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,290
it wasn't a spiritual Endeavor it was
supposed to be a mental health a science

298
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:33,300
supposed to be a mental health a science
 

299
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,909
supposed to be a mental health a science
of Mental Health

300
00:05:34,909 --> 00:05:34,919
of Mental Health
 

301
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:36,770
of Mental Health
so

302
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:36,780
so
 

303
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,350
so
as of that time the earliest engram you

304
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:39,360
as of that time the earliest engram you
 

305
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,050
as of that time the earliest engram you
could have was the incident of birth

306
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:42,060
could have was the incident of birth
 

307
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:45,110
could have was the incident of birth
being born was an engram

308
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:45,120
being born was an engram
 

309
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,510
being born was an engram
and technically in Dianetics they said

310
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:47,520
and technically in Dianetics they said
 

311
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,430
and technically in Dianetics they said
you could have prenatal n grams like

312
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:49,440
you could have prenatal n grams like
 

313
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,350
you could have prenatal n grams like
when you're still in the womb but there

314
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:51,360
when you're still in the womb but there
 

315
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,110
when you're still in the womb but there
was no concept of past lives as of 1950

316
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:54,120
was no concept of past lives as of 1950
 

317
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,510
was no concept of past lives as of 1950
version of Dianetics right

318
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:56,520
version of Dianetics right
 

319
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:00,950
version of Dianetics right
and so the idea there was that

320
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:00,960
and so the idea there was that
 

321
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,110
and so the idea there was that
uh the reactive mind is essentially a

322
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:03,120
uh the reactive mind is essentially a
 

323
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,210
uh the reactive mind is essentially a
stimulus response mechanism

324
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:05,220
stimulus response mechanism
 

325
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,610
stimulus response mechanism
uh created through Evolution millions of

326
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:07,620
uh created through Evolution millions of
 

327
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,590
uh created through Evolution millions of
years ago to protect the individual from

328
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:09,600
years ago to protect the individual from
 

329
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,969
years ago to protect the individual from
things that would harm them in other

330
00:06:10,969 --> 00:06:10,979
things that would harm them in other
 

331

words things that would bring about pain
 

333
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,270
words things that would bring about pain
and unconsciousness so you have these

334
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:14,280
and unconsciousness so you have these
 

335
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,590
and unconsciousness so you have these
recordings of things that hurt you

336
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:15,600
recordings of things that hurt you
 

337
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,870
recordings of things that hurt you
created pain and unconsciousness and in

338
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:17,880
created pain and unconsciousness and in
 

339
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,129
created pain and unconsciousness and in
present time these things will react

340
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:19,139
present time these things will react
 

341
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:23,450

get back to the moment of birth and
erase the earliest engram all the other

erase the earliest engram all the other
 

377
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:00,110
erase the earliest engram all the other
subsequent engrams on the Chain would

00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:00,120
subsequent engrams on the Chain would
 

379
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,870
subsequent engrams on the Chain would
vanish oh nice so there's a change

00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:02,759
Dynex auditing was there too so if we
 

437
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:04,909
Dynex auditing was there too so if we
just before Scientology what what are

438
00:08:04,909 --> 00:08:04,919
just before Scientology what what are
 

439
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:08,629
just before Scientology what what are
the ideas that formed what we know as

440
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:08,639
the ideas that formed what we know as
 

441
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,909
the ideas that formed what we know as
Dianetics as I've just described that is

much the nuts and bolts of dinetics was
 

447
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:17,029

no that's what diet next in the early

450
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:18,300
no that's what diet next in the early
 

451
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,730
no that's what diet next in the early
days was all about was just auditing

459
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,610
pain and unconsciousness run through the
engram over and over and over again find

460
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:25,620
engram over and over and over again find
 

461
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:26,869
engram over and over and over again find
something earlier similar that is

00:08:26,869 --> 00:08:26,879
something earlier similar that is

00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,490
something earlier similar that is
dianetics auditing one of the main

464
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:28,500
dianetics auditing one of the main
 

465
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,469
dianetics auditing one of the main
things that changed with Scientology is

466
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:30,479
things that changed with Scientology is
 

467
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,930
things that changed with Scientology is
that birth or prenatal ingrams were no

468
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:32,940
that birth or prenatal ingrams were no
 

469
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,670
that birth or prenatal ingrams were no
longer the earliest engrams on the Chain

470
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:34,680
longer the earliest engrams on the Chain
 

471
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,469
longer the earliest engrams on the Chain
yeah the idea is you have to get the

472
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:36,479
yeah the idea is you have to get the
 

473
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:37,670
yeah the idea is you have to get the
earliest engram on the chain for the

474
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:37,680
earliest engram on the chain for the
 

475
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,149
earliest engram on the chain for the
later ones to blow which is a race

476
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:40,159
later ones to blow which is a race
 

477
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,690
later ones to blow which is a race
and so but all of a sudden now with the

478
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:44,700
and so but all of a sudden now with the
 

479
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,670
and so but all of a sudden now with the
uh addition of an immortal spiritual

480
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:46,680
uh addition of an immortal spiritual
 

481
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,769
uh addition of an immortal spiritual
being into the equation well now the

482
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:48,779
being into the equation well now the
 

483
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:50,389
being into the equation well now the
earliest incident could be trillions of

484
00:08:50,389 --> 00:08:50,399
earliest incident could be trillions of
 

485
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:51,710
earliest incident could be trillions of
years ago in other galaxies and

486
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:51,720

origin of this universe yes is there a
 

491
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:57,769
origin of this universe yes is there a
model of physics integrated in any of

492
00:08:57,769 --> 00:08:57,779
model of physics integrated in any of
 

493
00:08:57,779 --> 00:08:58,850
model of physics integrated in any of
this no

494
00:08:58,850 --> 00:08:58,860
this no
 

495
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,889
this no
the model is you have the physical

496
00:09:00,889 --> 00:09:00,899
the model is you have the physical
 

497
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:02,750
the model is you have the physical
universe

498
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:02,760
universe
 

499
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,490
universe
and then above that you have the Theta

500
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:04,500
and then above that you have the Theta
 

501
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,170
and then above that you have the Theta
universe so we use the word thing

502
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:06,180
universe so we use the word thing
 

503
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,630
universe so we use the word thing
earlier so in Scientology let's use word

504
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:08,640
earlier so in Scientology let's use word
 

505
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,670
earlier so in Scientology let's use word
Theta

506
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:10,680
Theta
 

507
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,290
Theta
I don't know theta's just basically

508
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:12,300
I don't know theta's just basically
 

509
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,530
I don't know theta's just basically
thetan power Satan's collectively

510
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:15,540
thetan power Satan's collectively
 

511
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,810
thetan power Satan's collectively
so Hubbard would say you have the Theta

512
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:17,820
so Hubbard would say you have the Theta
 

513
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,030
so Hubbard would say you have the Theta
Universe which is senior to the physical

514
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:20,040
Universe which is senior to the physical
 

515
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,530
Universe which is senior to the physical
universe and creates the physical

516
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:21,540
universe and creates the physical
 

517
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,509
universe and creates the physical
universe and remember I said I said

518
00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:23,519
universe and remember I said I said
 

519
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,910
universe and remember I said I said
native god-like potentials so we're not

520
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:25,920
native god-like potentials so we're not
 

521
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,350
native god-like potentials so we're not
talking about the God who created the

522
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:27,360
talking about the God who created the
 

523
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,210
talking about the God who created the
Earth we're just like scientologists

524
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:29,220
Earth we're just like scientologists
 

525
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,410
Earth we're just like scientologists
don't believe in a God but we'll get

526
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:30,420
don't believe in a God but we'll get
 

527
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,550
don't believe in a God but we'll get
into that later

528
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:31,560
into that later
 

529
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,769
into that later
uh we're talking about CR just creating

530
00:09:33,769 --> 00:09:33,779
uh we're talking about CR just creating
 

531
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:36,050
uh we're talking about CR just creating
universes like just think like Matrix

532
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:36,060
universes like just think like Matrix
 

533
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,850
universes like just think like Matrix
like just when I say creating a universe

534
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:37,860
like just when I say creating a universe
 

535
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:38,870
like just when I say creating a universe
essentially just creating different

536
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:38,880
essentially just creating different
 

537
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,310
essentially just creating different
things simulations

538
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:40,320
things simulations
 

539
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,650
things simulations
but it sounds like a little bit more

540
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:42,660
but it sounds like a little bit more
 

541
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,810
but it sounds like a little bit more
like the ideas of Plato which is there's

542
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:44,820
like the ideas of Plato which is there's
 

543
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,030
like the ideas of Plato which is there's
these platonic forms there's abstract

544
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:47,040
these platonic forms there's abstract
 

545
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,470
these platonic forms there's abstract
forms that are

546
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:48,480
forms that are
 

547
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,949
forms that are
bigger more General than our particular

548
00:09:51,949 --> 00:09:51,959
bigger more General than our particular
 

549
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:54,710
bigger more General than our particular
reality here and those forms are used to

550
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:54,720
reality here and those forms are used to
 

551
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,750
reality here and those forms are used to
construct the reality well I grew up in

552
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:56,760
construct the reality well I grew up in
 

553
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,769
construct the reality well I grew up in
a call so I'm not familiar with the

554
00:09:57,769 --> 00:09:57,779
a call so I'm not familiar with the
 

555
00:09:57,779 --> 00:09:58,310
a call so I'm not familiar with the
works of Plato

556
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:58,320
works of Plato
 

557
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,650
works of Plato
[Laughter]

558
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:00,660
[Laughter]
 

559
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,570
[Laughter]
you can't use that as an excuse for

560
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:02,580
you can't use that as an excuse for
 

561
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,590
you can't use that as an excuse for
everything

562
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:03,600
everything
 

563
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,410
everything
I would like to you know non-jokingly

564
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:06,420
I would like to you know non-jokingly
 

565
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,750
I would like to you know non-jokingly
yeah Steel Man the case because a lot of

566
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:08,760
yeah Steel Man the case because a lot of
 

567
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,509
yeah Steel Man the case because a lot of
philosophies a lot of religions a lot

568
00:10:11,509 --> 00:10:11,519
philosophies a lot of religions a lot
 

569
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,570
philosophies a lot of religions a lot
even scientific endeavors

570
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:13,580
even scientific endeavors
 

571
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:18,170
even scientific endeavors
are a little bit full of uncertainty you

572
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:18,180
are a little bit full of uncertainty you
 

573
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,449
are a little bit full of uncertainty you
can call it [\h__\h] but they're you're

574
00:10:20,449 --> 00:10:20,459
can call it [\h__\h] but they're you're
 

575
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:21,949
can call it [\h__\h] but they're you're
on on sturdy ground because we're

576
00:10:21,949 --> 00:10:21,959
on on sturdy ground because we're
 

577
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:23,870
on on sturdy ground because we're
surrounded by mystery and you have to

578
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:23,880
surrounded by mystery and you have to
 

579
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,430
surrounded by mystery and you have to
take these ideas

580
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:25,440
take these ideas
 

581
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,130
take these ideas
somewhat seriously and see where those

582
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:28,140
somewhat seriously and see where those
 

583
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,470
somewhat seriously and see where those
ideas go wrong this happens with

584
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:30,480
ideas go wrong this happens with
 

585
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,269
ideas go wrong this happens with
Communism this happens with capitalism

586
00:10:32,269 --> 00:10:32,279
Communism this happens with capitalism
 

587
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:35,210
Communism this happens with capitalism
these ideas sound beautiful in their

588
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:35,220
these ideas sound beautiful in their
 

589
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,370
these ideas sound beautiful in their
ideal forms and then they somehow go

590
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:37,380
ideal forms and then they somehow go
 

591
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,170
ideal forms and then they somehow go
wrong and some go more wrong than others

592
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:39,180
wrong and some go more wrong than others
 

593
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,410
wrong and some go more wrong than others
and so I don't think sort of it's easy

594
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:42,420
and so I don't think sort of it's easy
 

595
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,690
and so I don't think sort of it's easy
to

596
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:44,700
to
 

597
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,210
to
sort of caricature and make fun of the

598
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:47,220
sort of caricature and make fun of the
 

599
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,190
sort of caricature and make fun of the
ideas I think if we take them seriously

600
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:49,200
ideas I think if we take them seriously
 

601
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,590
ideas I think if we take them seriously
you'll start to understand like when

602
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:51,600
you'll start to understand like when
 

603
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,930
you'll start to understand like when
you're in it it was serious uh it can be

604
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:53,940
you're in it it was serious uh it can be
 

605
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,970
you're in it it was serious uh it can be
very convincing it's you know the the

606
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:55,980
very convincing it's you know the the
 

607
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,769
very convincing it's you know the the
devil is going to be a charismatic

608
00:10:57,769 --> 00:10:57,779
devil is going to be a charismatic
 

609
00:10:57,779 --> 00:10:59,329
devil is going to be a charismatic
person he's not going to be a caricature

610
00:10:59,329 --> 00:10:59,339
person he's not going to be a caricature
 

611
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:01,430
person he's not going to be a caricature
of ridiculous person so that that helps

612
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:01,440
of ridiculous person so that that helps
 

613
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,590
of ridiculous person so that that helps
us understand which ideas

614
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:03,600
us understand which ideas
 

615
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,050
us understand which ideas
uh will sound appealing but will become

616
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:06,060
uh will sound appealing but will become
 

617
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,850
uh will sound appealing but will become
dangerous I totally agree in fact it's

618
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:07,860
dangerous I totally agree in fact it's
 

619
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,090
dangerous I totally agree in fact it's
one of the

620
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:10,100
one of the
 

621
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,949
one of the
thrusts uh I have on my channel is

622
00:11:12,949 --> 00:11:12,959
thrusts uh I have on my channel is
 

623
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,750
thrusts uh I have on my channel is
wanting to talk about scientology in a

624
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:14,760
wanting to talk about scientology in a
 

625
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,970
wanting to talk about scientology in a
way that would actually resonate with

626
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:16,980
way that would actually resonate with
 

627
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:20,329
way that would actually resonate with
current scientologists not just resonate

628
00:11:20,329 --> 00:11:20,339
current scientologists not just resonate
 

629
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:22,370
current scientologists not just resonate
with former scientologists I want people

630
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:22,380
with former scientologists I want people
 

631
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,930
with former scientologists I want people
who are still in to be able to hear how

632
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:23,940
who are still in to be able to hear how

640
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:33,180
look at the you know let's take one of
 

641
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,569
look at the you know let's take one of
the worst places on Earth is North Korea

general journalists in these kinds of
 

813
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,590
general journalists in these kinds of
situations can be

814
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:39,600
situations can be
 

815
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,189

um

816
00:14:40,189 --> 00:14:40,199

can attack
in a way that doesn't empathize and

820
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:43,920
in a way that doesn't empathize and
 

821
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,410
in a way that doesn't empathize and
doesn't come from a place of deep

822
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:45,420
doesn't come from a place of deep
 

823
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,150
doesn't come from a place of deep
knowledge and understanding and I think

824
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:47,160
knowledge and understanding and I think
 

825
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,889
knowledge and understanding and I think
it's possible to have serious

826
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:48,899
it's possible to have serious
 

827
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:51,829
it's possible to have serious

00:14:51,829 --> 00:14:51,839
conversations with people like that in
 

829
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,449
conversations with people like that in
an empathetic way but it's also in a

830
00:14:53,449 --> 00:14:53,459
an empathetic way but it's also in a
 

831
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,430
an empathetic way but it's also in a
challenging way I think there's a huge

832
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:55,440
challenging way I think there's a huge
 

833
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,530
challenging way I think there's a huge
amount of trust required and obviously

834
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:57,540
amount of trust required and obviously
 

835
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:01,009
amount of trust required and obviously
for us a very secretive organization the

836
00:15:01,009 --> 00:15:01,019
for us a very secretive organization the
 

837
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:03,550
for us a very secretive organization the
amount of trust yes might be too much

838
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:03,560
amount of trust yes might be too much
 

839
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,569
amount of trust yes might be too much
required anyone over there if they've

00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:07,250
required anyone over there if they've
done their homework knows you're going

845
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,069
to be as Fair as anyone in the world is
going to be

of power but let's just explore the
 

973
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,909
of power but let's just explore the
ideas a little bit more

974
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:22,919
ideas a little bit more
 

975
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:25,189
ideas a little bit more
um so the the public facing three

976
00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:25,199
um so the the public facing three
 

977
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,230
um so the the public facing three
fundamental truths of

978
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:27,240
fundamental truths of
 

979
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,450
fundamental truths of
Scientology maybe correct me if I'm

980
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:29,460
Scientology maybe correct me if I'm

being like with said with Satan's his

984
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:34,320
being like with said with Satan's his
 

985

00:17:36,169 --> 00:17:36,179
experience extends well beyond a single
 

987
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:38,450
experience extends well beyond a single
lifetime so infinite memory backwards

988
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:38,460
lifetime so infinite memory backwards
 

989
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:41,029
lifetime so infinite memory backwards
his capabilities are unlimited even if

not presently realized
 

993
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,830
not presently realized
the capabilities are unlimited yeah so

994
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:45,840
the capabilities are unlimited yeah so
 

995
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,390
the capabilities are unlimited yeah so
that when I say god-like I really just

996
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:47,400
that when I say god-like I really just

00:18:08,029 --> 00:18:08,039
space or time ethane does not actually
 

1013
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:10,610
space or time ethane does not actually
exist in the physical Universe it might

1014
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:10,620
exist in the physical Universe it might
 

1015
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:13,130
exist in the physical Universe it might
choose to locate itself in the physical

1016
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:13,140
choose to locate itself in the physical
 

1017
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,470
choose to locate itself in the physical
Universe right and then forget that it

1018
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:15,480
Universe right and then forget that it
 

1019
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,970
Universe right and then forget that it
made that decision and then sort of get

1020
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:16,980
made that decision and then sort of get
 

1021
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,110
made that decision and then sort of get
caught and trapped in the physical

1022
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:18,120
caught and trapped in the physical
 

1023
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,350
caught and trapped in the physical
universe but that once the thing is uh

1024
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:21,360
universe but that once the thing is uh
 

1025
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,490
universe but that once the thing is uh
restored to its native powers

1026
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:25,500
restored to its native powers
 

1027
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,570
restored to its native powers
um everything you see here in the

1028
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:26,580
um everything you see here in the
 

1029
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:27,890
um everything you see here in the
physical universe is just a thing

1030
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:27,900
physical universe is just a thing
 

1031
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,390
physical universe is just a thing
playing a game

1032
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:29,400
playing a game
 

1033
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,250
playing a game
like later we are in a simulation right

1034
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:31,260
like later we are in a simulation right
 

1035
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,710
like later we are in a simulation right
now of something so like physics doesn't

1036
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:33,720
now of something so like physics doesn't
 

1037
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,909
now of something so like physics doesn't
have to make sense when we're talking

1038
00:18:34,909 --> 00:18:34,919
have to make sense when we're talking
 

1039
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:36,590
have to make sense when we're talking
about it this way like technically

1040
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:36,600
about it this way like technically
 

1041
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,510
about it this way like technically
urethane imatha and we're here but

1042
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:38,520
urethane imatha and we're here but
 

1043
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,770
urethane imatha and we're here but
because this could also all just be

1044
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:39,780
because this could also all just be
 

1045
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,870
because this could also all just be
another thing's game so Satan's all the

1046
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:41,880
another thing's game so Satan's all the
 

1047
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,850
another thing's game so Satan's all the
way down yeah it's just Dayton's

1048
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:43,860
way down yeah it's just Dayton's
 

1049
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,590
way down yeah it's just Dayton's
everywhere things it all comes down to

1050
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:45,600
everywhere things it all comes down to
 

1051
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,930
everywhere things it all comes down to

1053
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,669
the thing is there an idea of a God
because I've read there's a kind of

example of sort of the fundamental baked
 

1227
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,750

I wonder how do you do you know the
process of what it takes to prove that

1236
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:56,640
process of what it takes to prove that
 

1237
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,970
process of what it takes to prove that
some an organization is a religion while

00:21:58,970 --> 00:21:58,980
some an organization is a religion while
 

1239
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,890
some an organization is a religion while
going through that process with the IRS

1240
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:00,900
going through that process with the IRS
 

1241
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,390
going through that process with the IRS

for the second time by the way
Scientology actually had tax exemption

1244
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:04,020
Scientology actually had tax exemption
 

1245
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,690
Scientology actually had tax exemption
in the early days and the IRS pulled it

1246
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:05,700
in the early days and the IRS pulled it
 

1247
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,510
in the early days and the IRS pulled it
and then they got it back in 1993. while

1248
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:08,520
and then they got it back in 1993. while
 

1249
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,970
and then they got it back in 1993. while
going through that process again the IRS

1250
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:10,980
going through that process again the IRS
 

1251
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:13,789
going through that process again the IRS
actually took issue with the fact that

1252
00:22:13,789 --> 00:22:13,799
actually took issue with the fact that
 

1253
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:15,710
actually took issue with the fact that
Scientology was claiming you could be a

1283
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:46,970
mentioned survival so that seems to be a
core principle that that human existence

1284
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:46,980
core principle that that human existence
 

1285
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:49,730
core principle that that human existence
is about survival can you elaborate what

1286
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:49,740
is about survival can you elaborate what
 

1287
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:50,990
is about survival can you elaborate what
is meant by survival are we talking

1288
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:51,000
is meant by survival are we talking
 

1289
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,430
is meant by survival are we talking
about the survival of the human species

1290
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:52,440
about the survival of the human species
 

1291
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,310
about the survival of the human species
survival of the individual humans

1292
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:54,320
survival of the individual humans
 

1293
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,970
survival of the individual humans
survival of the manifestation of Satan's

1294
00:22:58,970 --> 00:22:58,980
survival of the manifestation of Satan's
 

1295
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:01,130
survival of the manifestation of Satan's
in human form what what do we what's

1296
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:01,140
in human form what what do we what's
 

1297
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,750
in human form what what do we what's
survival so it would be all of that

1298
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:02,760
survival so it would be all of that
 

1299
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:06,110
survival so it would be all of that
because survival is the the dominant

1300
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:06,120
because survival is the the dominant
 

1301
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,850
because survival is the the dominant

1303
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:10,190

that I mean L Ron Hubbard it was either

1304
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:10,200
that I mean L Ron Hubbard it was either
 

1305
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,190
that I mean L Ron Hubbard it was either
Dianetics or science of survival he

1306
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:13,200
Dianetics or science of survival he
 

1307
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,730
Dianetics or science of survival he
he says he discovered the principle upon

1308
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:16,740
he says he discovered the principle upon
 

1309
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:19,850
he says he discovered the principle upon
which all life exists and that is all

1310
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:19,860
which all life exists and that is all
 

1311
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:22,010
which all life exists and that is all
life no matter what it is trying to do

1312
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:22,020
life no matter what it is trying to do
 

1313
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,230

1393
00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:47,090
if you just set a little bit of the ego
behind that aside there's actually

1394
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:47,100
behind that aside there's actually
 

1395
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,130
behind that aside there's actually
beautiful ideas in there they have of

1396
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:49,140
beautiful ideas in there they have of
 

1397
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,630
beautiful ideas in there they have of
course been done before and explored

1398
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:50,640
course been done before and explored
 

1399
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,930
course been done before and explored
before but sometimes people declare the

1400
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:53,940
before but sometimes people declare the
 

1401
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,010
before but sometimes people declare the
coolest that's the only thing I'm really

1402
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:55,020
coolest that's the only thing I'm really
 

1403
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:57,289
coolest that's the only thing I'm really
mocking is yes this discovery that life

1404
00:24:57,289 --> 00:24:57,299
mocking is yes this discovery that life
 

1405
00:24:57,299 --> 00:24:59,450
mocking is yes this discovery that life
is trying to survive is greater than the

1406
00:24:59,450 --> 00:24:59,460
is trying to survive is greater than the
 

1407
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,370
is trying to survive is greater than the
discovery of fire okay I mean it gets a

1408
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:01,380
discovery of fire okay I mean it gets a
 

1409
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:02,750
discovery of fire okay I mean it gets a
little silly but that's fine we can

1410
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:02,760
little silly but that's fine we can
 

1411
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,730
little silly but that's fine we can
agree that the fact that life is trying

1412
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:04,740
agree that the fact that life is trying
 

1413
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,649
agree that the fact that life is trying
to survive has meaning and is Meaningful

1414
00:25:06,649 --> 00:25:06,659
to survive has meaning and is Meaningful
 

1415
00:25:06,659 --> 00:25:09,289
to survive has meaning and is Meaningful
and can be is valuable and it's true I

1416
00:25:09,289 --> 00:25:09,299
and can be is valuable and it's true I
 

1417
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:11,090
and can be is valuable and it's true I
mean life is trying to survive also

1418
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:11,100
mean life is trying to survive also
 

1419
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,529
mean life is trying to survive also
there's a non-trivial definition of what

1420
00:25:12,529 --> 00:25:12,539
there's a non-trivial definition of what
 

1421
00:25:12,539 --> 00:25:15,710
there's a non-trivial definition of what
is life here so this idea of a thing the

1422
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:15,720
is life here so this idea of a thing the
 

1423
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,090
is life here so this idea of a thing the
thing that permeates

1424
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:17,100
thing that permeates
 

1425
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,250
thing that permeates
through lifetimes yeah through people

1426
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:19,260
through lifetimes yeah through people
 

1427
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:22,070
through lifetimes yeah through people
there's some some fabric that is bigger

1428
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:22,080
there's some some fabric that is bigger
 

1429
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,649
there's some some fabric that is bigger
than the individual biological bags of

1430
00:25:24,649 --> 00:25:24,659
than the individual biological bags of
 

1431
00:25:24,659 --> 00:25:27,529
than the individual biological bags of
meat that's a philosophically

1432
00:25:27,529 --> 00:25:27,539
meat that's a philosophically
 

1433
00:25:27,539 --> 00:25:28,970
meat that's a philosophically
interesting idea of course if it's not

1434
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:28,980
interesting idea of course if it's not
 

1435
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:32,510
interesting idea of course if it's not
grounded in a little bit more uh a

1436
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:32,520
grounded in a little bit more uh a
 

1437
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,310
grounded in a little bit more uh a
physical reality then it becomes a

1438

the resistance to a small electrical
 

1851
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:55,010

pull up Mark eight e-meter Mark eight so
 

1887
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:39,049
pull up Mark eight e-meter Mark eight so
there's a few dials you know there's a

1888
00:33:39,049 --> 00:33:39,059
there's a few dials you know there's a
 

1889
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:41,450
there's a few dials you know there's a
basic information about time and

1890
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:41,460
basic information about time and
 

1891
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:43,370
basic information about time and
duration I'm presuming then a dial that

1892
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:43,380
duration I'm presuming then a dial that
 

1893
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:45,830
duration I'm presuming then a dial that
just goes zero to something okay so

1894
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:45,840
just goes zero to something okay so
 

1895
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,750
just goes zero to something okay so

00:33:56,690 --> 00:33:56,700
beginning of an auditing session when
 

1907
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:57,830
beginning of an auditing session when
you're calibrating the sensitivity

1908
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:57,840
you're calibrating the sensitivity
 

1909
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,990
you're calibrating the sensitivity
sensitivity of the emitter you do like a

1910
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:00,000
sensitivity of the emitter you do like a
 

1911
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,370
sensitivity of the emitter you do like a
can squeeze so I go squeeze the cans

1912
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:01,380
can squeeze so I go squeeze the cans
 

1913
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,110
can squeeze so I go squeeze the cans
please okay so I'm just like squeezing

1914
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:03,120
please okay so I'm just like squeezing
 

1915
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,070
please okay so I'm just like squeezing
yeah and I'm just changing the

1916
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:04,080
yeah and I'm just changing the
 

1917
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,389
yeah and I'm just changing the
sensitivity because when you squeeze the

1918
00:34:05,389 --> 00:34:05,399
sensitivity because when you squeeze the
 

1919
00:34:05,399 --> 00:34:06,830
sensitivity because when you squeeze the
cans I want to get about a one-third of

1920
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:06,840
cans I want to get about a one-third of
 

1921
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,930
cans I want to get about a one-third of
a dial drop on the needle the idea is

1922
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:08,940
a dial drop on the needle the idea is
 

1923
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:10,129
a dial drop on the needle the idea is
you don't want if the needle's too

1924
00:34:10,129 --> 00:34:10,139
you don't want if the needle's too
 

1925
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:11,930
you don't want if the needle's too
sensitive then every time you shift

1926
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:11,940
sensitive then every time you shift
 

1927
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,129
sensitive then every time you shift
around in your chair the needle is going

1928
00:34:13,129 --> 00:34:13,139
around in your chair the needle is going
 

1929
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:14,210
around in your chair the needle is going
to bounce all over the place so you're

1930
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:14,220
to bounce all over the place so you're
 

1931
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,530
to bounce all over the place so you're
trying to set the sensitivity to this

1932
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:15,540
trying to set the sensitivity to this
 

1933
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:18,290
trying to set the sensitivity to this
thing and that's all the the knob there

1934
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:18,300
thing and that's all the the knob there
 

1935
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,510
thing and that's all the the knob there
on the bottom to the left that's the

1936
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:20,520
on the bottom to the left that's the
 

1937
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,770
on the bottom to the left that's the
sensitivity knob

1938
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:21,780
sensitivity knob
 

1939
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:24,649
sensitivity knob
and that determines just uh how much how

1940
00:34:24,649 --> 00:34:24,659
and that determines just uh how much how
 

1941
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:26,629
and that determines just uh how much how
sensitive the needle is going to be and

1942
00:34:26,629 --> 00:34:26,639
sensitive the needle is going to be and
 

1943
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,270
sensitive the needle is going to be and
the the bigger dial is called the tone

1944
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:29,280
the the bigger dial is called the tone
 

1945
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,530
the the bigger dial is called the tone
arm and that is changing uh I want to

1946
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:33,540
arm and that is changing uh I want to
 

1947
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:34,909
arm and that is changing uh I want to
say voltage or current but I'm not

1948
00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:34,919
say voltage or current but I'm not
 

1949
00:34:34,919 --> 00:34:35,930
say voltage or current but I'm not
intending I'm going to get one of those

1950
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:35,940
intending I'm going to get one of those
 

1951
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,490
intending I'm going to get one of those
words that's wrong right but it is a

1952
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:37,500
words that's wrong right but it is a
 

1953
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,470
words that's wrong right but it is a
real device it's a real device so you

1954
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:39,480
real device it's a real device so you
 

1955
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:44,570
real device it's a real device so you
can actually calibrate uh to probably

1956
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:44,580
can actually calibrate uh to probably
 

1957
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:46,730
can actually calibrate uh to probably
you know get an outcome that you want

1958
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:46,740
you know get an outcome that you want
 

1959
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:48,589
you know get an outcome that you want
yeah so here's even how just how a

1960
00:34:48,589 --> 00:34:48,599
yeah so here's even how just how a
 

1961
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:51,290
yeah so here's even how just how a
Scientology auditor believes it works

1962
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:51,300
Scientology auditor believes it works
 

1963
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,849
Scientology auditor believes it works
you're holding the cans there's a tiny

1964
00:34:52,849 --> 00:34:52,859
you're holding the cans there's a tiny
 

1965
00:34:52,859 --> 00:34:54,050
you're holding the cans there's a tiny
little battery in that emitter that's

1966
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:54,060
little battery in that emitter that's
 

1967
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,490
little battery in that emitter that's
sending you're completing the circuit

1968
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:55,500
sending you're completing the circuit
 

1969
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,930
sending you're completing the circuit
when you pick up the cans right so you

1970
00:34:56,930 --> 00:34:56,940
when you pick up the cans right so you
 

1971
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:59,450
when you pick up the cans right so you
got a little thing going there and that

1972
00:34:59,450 --> 00:34:59,460
got a little thing going there and that
 

1973
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,670
got a little thing going there and that
needle will respond to your physical

1974
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:01,680
needle will respond to your physical
 

1975
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,349
needle will respond to your physical
movement but that's not what we want we

1976
00:35:03,349 --> 00:35:03,359
movement but that's not what we want we
 

1977
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:04,790
movement but that's not what we want we
want you to sit the hell still so that

1978
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:04,800
want you to sit the hell still so that
 

1979
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,170
want you to sit the hell still so that
we can read this thing when I'm asking

1980
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:06,180
we can read this thing when I'm asking
 

1981
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,130
we can read this thing when I'm asking
you questions

1982
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:07,140
you questions
 

1983
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:09,650
you questions
okay so you're sitting there still very

1984
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:09,660
okay so you're sitting there still very
 

1985
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:12,050
okay so you're sitting there still very
still as still as you can comfortable

1986
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:12,060
still as still as you can comfortable
 

1987
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,790
still as still as you can comfortable
right and I'm gonna go is there

1988
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:13,800
right and I'm gonna go is there
 

1989
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,530
right and I'm gonna go is there
something you're withholding from me and

1990
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:15,540
something you're withholding from me and
 

1991
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,270
something you're withholding from me and
what I'm looking for is right when I say

1992
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:17,280
what I'm looking for is right when I say
 

1993
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,650
what I'm looking for is right when I say
at the end of me I'm looking for the

1994
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:18,660
at the end of me I'm looking for the
 

1995
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,569
at the end of me I'm looking for the
needle to dip to the right having a

1996
00:35:20,569 --> 00:35:20,579
needle to dip to the right having a
 

1997
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:22,970
needle to dip to the right having a
needle even if it's kind of random

1998
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:22,980
needle even if it's kind of random
 

1999
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:26,569
needle even if it's kind of random
can really be like um a catalyst for a

2000
00:35:26,569 --> 00:35:26,579
can really be like um a catalyst for a
 

2001
00:35:26,579 --> 00:35:28,730
can really be like um a catalyst for a
conversation that's what it's used for

2002
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:28,740
conversation that's what it's used for
 

2003
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:30,950
conversation that's what it's used for
except it's an enforced conversation so

2004
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:30,960
except it's an enforced conversation so
 

2005
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,329
except it's an enforced conversation so
I'll give you a really good example of

2006
00:35:32,329 --> 00:35:32,339
I'll give you a really good example of
 

2007
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:34,430
I'll give you a really good example of
this so

2008
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:34,440
this so
 

2009
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,710
this so
you're holding the cans say is there

2010
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:36,720
you're holding the cans say is there
 

2011
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,690
you're holding the cans say is there
anything you're withholding from me

2012
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:38,700
anything you're withholding from me
 

2013
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,730
anything you're withholding from me
and I get an instant read

2014
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:40,740
and I get an instant read
 

2015
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,109
and I get an instant read
and I go is there anything you're

2016
00:35:42,109 --> 00:35:42,119
and I go is there anything you're
 

2017
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:43,849
and I go is there anything you're
worthholding for me you're gonna go I

2018
00:35:43,849 --> 00:35:43,859
worthholding for me you're gonna go I
 

2019
00:35:43,859 --> 00:35:45,530
worthholding for me you're gonna go I
don't think so and I don't see the

2020
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:45,540
don't think so and I don't see the
 

2021
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,510
don't think so and I don't see the
needle no you don't see the needle okay

2022
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:47,520
needle no you don't see the needle okay
 

2023
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,970
needle no you don't see the needle okay
I go well what did you think of when I

2024
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:49,980
I go well what did you think of when I
 

2025
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,349
I go well what did you think of when I
asked you the question now if you've

2026
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:51,359
asked you the question now if you've
 

2027
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:52,550
asked you the question now if you've
already had a lot of auditing you know

2028
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:52,560
already had a lot of auditing you know
 

2029
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,109
already had a lot of auditing you know
how this goes it means I got an instant

2030
00:35:54,109 --> 00:35:54,119
how this goes it means I got an instant
 

2031
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:56,750
how this goes it means I got an instant
read and we're not going to move on

2032
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:56,760
read and we're not going to move on
 

2033
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,730
read and we're not going to move on
until this question gets resolved okay

2034
00:35:58,730 --> 00:35:58,740
until this question gets resolved okay
 

2035
00:35:58,740 --> 00:35:59,870
until this question gets resolved okay
so you're gonna go I don't know what I

2036
00:35:59,870 --> 00:35:59,880
so you're gonna go I don't know what I
 

2037
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,910
so you're gonna go I don't know what I
was thinking of and then I'm gonna I'll

2038
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:01,920
was thinking of and then I'm gonna I'll
 

2039
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,170
was thinking of and then I'm gonna I'll
be like you know take a look and I'll

2040
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:03,180
be like you know take a look and I'll
 

2041
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,670
be like you know take a look and I'll
help you out here I'll try to steer you

2042
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:04,680
help you out here I'll try to steer you
 

2043
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,650
help you out here I'll try to steer you
okay so I'm looking to get roughly the

2044
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:06,660
okay so I'm looking to get roughly the
 

2045
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,450
okay so I'm looking to get roughly the
same read while you're thinking about

2046
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:08,460
same read while you're thinking about
 

2047
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,790
same read while you're thinking about
whatever I mean what was that what was

2048
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:10,800
whatever I mean what was that what was
 

2049
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,349
whatever I mean what was that what was
that right there and you can start

2050
00:36:12,349 --> 00:36:12,359
that right there and you can start
 

2051
00:36:12,359 --> 00:36:14,750
that right there and you can start
digging to what you can start I just

2052
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:14,760
digging to what you can start I just
 

2053
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,849
digging to what you can start I just
want an answer to the question okay and

2054
00:36:16,849 --> 00:36:16,859
want an answer to the question okay and
 

2055
00:36:16,859 --> 00:36:19,190
want an answer to the question okay and
I can go to memory yeah and you can give

2056
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:19,200
I can go to memory yeah and you can give
 

2057

the way I'm writing all this down so I'm

2080
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:38,880
the way I'm writing all this down so I'm
 

2081
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,829
the way I'm writing all this down so I'm

okay so I'm keeping notes
 

2089
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,069
okay so I'm keeping notes
when you represent to me that you've

2090
00:36:46,069 --> 00:36:46,079
when you represent to me that you've
 

2091
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,810
when you represent to me that you've
told me everything there is to tell I'm

2093
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:50,690
told me everything there is to tell I'm
looking for the needle to give like a

2094
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:50,700
looking for the needle to give like a
 

2095
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,550
looking for the needle to give like a
smooth back and forth motion like this

2096
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:52,560
smooth back and forth motion like this
 

2097
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,650
smooth back and forth motion like this
and Scientology calls that a floating

2098
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:54,660
and Scientology calls that a floating
 

2099
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:57,349
and Scientology calls that a floating
needle that means in Scientology land

2100
00:36:57,349 --> 00:36:57,359
needle that means in Scientology land
 

2101
00:36:57,359 --> 00:36:59,450
needle that means in Scientology land
we're done with that

2102
00:36:59,450 --> 00:36:59,460
we're done with that
 

2103
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:00,950
we're done with that
so now I might go back to check the

2104
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:00,960
so now I might go back to check the
 

2105
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:01,970
so now I might go back to check the
question okay good I'll check the

2106
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:01,980
question okay good I'll check the
 

2107
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:02,930
question okay good I'll check the
question again is there anything you're

2108
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:02,940
question again is there anything you're
 

2109
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:04,910
question again is there anything you're
withholding from me oh if I get another

withholding from me oh if I get another
 

2111
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,050
withholding from me oh if I get another
read we got to go through the process

2112
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:06,060
read we got to go through the process
 

2113
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:09,230
read we got to go through the process
again okay if you tell me I've told you

2114
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:09,240
again okay if you tell me I've told you
 

2115
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,550
again okay if you tell me I've told you
everything and I don't get a floating

2116
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:10,560
everything and I don't get a floating
 

2117
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,370
everything and I don't get a floating
needle I've got to go okay is there an

2118
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:13,380
needle I've got to go okay is there an
 

2119
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,410
needle I've got to go okay is there an

thing that you did the thing that you
just told me

2132
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:23,460
just told me
 

2133
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:25,250
just told me
we're going to keep going earlier

2134
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:25,260
we're going to keep going earlier
 

2135
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,230
we're going to keep going earlier
similar earlier similar earlier similar

2136
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:27,240
similar earlier similar earlier similar
 

2137
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,390
similar earlier similar earlier similar
until I get a floating needle and that's

2138
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:29,400
until I get a floating needle and that's
 

2139
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,730
until I get a floating needle and that's
where I'm explaining it this way you can

2140
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:31,740
where I'm explaining it this way you can
 

2141
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,770
where I'm explaining it this way you can
see how no matter what the specific

2142
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:33,780
see how no matter what the specific
 

2143
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,650
see how no matter what the specific
auditing session happens to be about

2144
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:35,660
auditing session happens to be about
 

2145
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,550
auditing session happens to be about
there's still the potential in any

2146
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:37,560
there's still the potential in any
 

2147
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,690
there's still the potential in any
auditing session that you're going into

2148
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:38,700
auditing session that you're going into
 

2149
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:41,990
auditing session that you're going into
past lives yeah just because you have to

2150
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:42,000
past lives yeah just because you have to
 

2151
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,310
past lives yeah just because you have to
go earlier similar until you get a

2152
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:43,320
go earlier similar until you get a
 

2153
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:46,310
go earlier similar until you get a
floating needle okay now here's how

2154
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:46,320
floating needle okay now here's how
 

2155
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,230
floating needle okay now here's how
scientologists think the emitter

2156
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:48,240
scientologists think the emitter
 

2157
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,390
scientologists think the emitter
actually works meaning why does the

2158
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:50,400
actually works meaning why does the
 

2159
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,250
actually works meaning why does the
emitter work so we talked before about

2160
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:52,260
emitter work so we talked before about
 

2161
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:55,130
emitter work so we talked before about
these um these mental pictures right

2162
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:55,140
these um these mental pictures right
 

2163
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:57,530
these um these mental pictures right
these recordings okay well we spoke

2164
00:37:57,530 --> 00:37:57,540
these recordings okay well we spoke
 

2165
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,630
these recordings okay well we spoke
about engrams just recordings of pain

2166
00:37:59,630 --> 00:37:59,640
about engrams just recordings of pain
 

2167
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,010
about engrams just recordings of pain
and unconsciousness

2168
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:01,020
and unconsciousness
 

2169
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:04,910
and unconsciousness
well Scientology would hold the the bad

2170
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:04,920
well Scientology would hold the the bad
 

2171
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,470
well Scientology would hold the the bad
recordings aren't the only recordings

2172
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:06,480
recordings aren't the only recordings
 

2173
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,150
recordings aren't the only recordings
that you have those are just the

2174
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:08,160
that you have those are just the
 

2175
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,950
that you have those are just the
recordings in your reactive mind you

2176
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:09,960
recordings in your reactive mind you
 

2177
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,870
recordings in your reactive mind you
also have an analytical mind which is

2178
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:11,880
also have an analytical mind which is
 

2179
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,329
also have an analytical mind which is
just your conscious memory conscious

2180
00:38:14,329 --> 00:38:14,339
just your conscious memory conscious
 

2181
00:38:14,339 --> 00:38:15,470
just your conscious memory conscious
recording of everything from present

2182
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:15,480
recording of everything from present
 

2183
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:18,170
recording of everything from present
time to the last 76 trillion years yeah

2184
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:18,180
time to the last 76 trillion years yeah
 

2185
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:20,270
time to the last 76 trillion years yeah
and Hubbard would say that these

2186
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:20,280
and Hubbard would say that these
 

2187
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,250
and Hubbard would say that these
memories are actually a perfectly

2188
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:22,260
memories are actually a perfectly
 

2189
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,170
memories are actually a perfectly
detailed recording and these does like

2190
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:24,180
detailed recording and these does like
 

2191
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:26,510
detailed recording and these does like
56 perceptions or something and that

2192
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:26,520
56 perceptions or something and that
 

2193
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,829
56 perceptions or something and that
it's perfect

2194
00:38:27,829 --> 00:38:27,839
it's perfect
 

2195
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:31,849
it's perfect
and you can access that information you

2196
00:38:31,849 --> 00:38:31,859
and you can access that information you
 

2197
00:38:31,859 --> 00:38:34,310
and you can access that information you
just have trouble doing so okay so he

2198
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:34,320
just have trouble doing so okay so he
 

2199
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,930
just have trouble doing so okay so he
says that these recordings these mental

2200
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:35,940
says that these recordings these mental
 

2201
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,790
says that these recordings these mental
pictures have actual electrical charge

2202
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:37,800
pictures have actual electrical charge
 

2203
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,410
pictures have actual electrical charge
and Mass

2204
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:39,420
and Mass
 

2205
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:41,030
and Mass
now you asked before is there any actual

2206
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:41,040
now you asked before is there any actual
 

2207
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,010
now you asked before is there any actual
physics in this I don't know where are

2208
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:43,020
physics in this I don't know where are
 

2209
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,450
physics in this I don't know where are
you supposed to store the pictures of

2210
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:44,460
you supposed to store the pictures of
 

2211
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:46,250
you supposed to store the pictures of
your last 76 trillion years that have

2212
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:46,260
your last 76 trillion years that have
 

2213
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,690
your last 76 trillion years that have
charge in Mass

2214
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:47,700
charge in Mass
 

2215
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,609
charge in Mass
I don't see it but Hubbard says it's

2216
00:38:49,609 --> 00:38:49,619
I don't see it but Hubbard says it's
 

2217
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:51,770
I don't see it but Hubbard says it's
there okay

2218
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:51,780
there okay
 

2219
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:54,410
there okay
so he says that these things have mass

2220
00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:54,420
so he says that these things have mass
 

2221
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:56,750
so he says that these things have mass
and when you recall them or put

2222
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:56,760
and when you recall them or put
 

2223
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,010
and when you recall them or put
attention on them

2224
00:38:58,010 --> 00:38:58,020
attention on them
 

2225
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:00,170
attention on them
you create an electrical flow

2226
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:00,180
you create an electrical flow
 

2227
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,270
you create an electrical flow
which maybe through magnetic fields or

2228
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:02,280
which maybe through magnetic fields or
 

2229
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:05,210
which maybe through magnetic fields or
whatever impinges upon the electrical

2230
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:05,220
whatever impinges upon the electrical
 

2231
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:08,690
whatever impinges upon the electrical
flow of the emitter and it shows up as a

2232
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:08,700
flow of the emitter and it shows up as a
 

2233
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,670
flow of the emitter and it shows up as a
read on the needle that's how

2234
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:10,680
read on the needle that's how
 

2235
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,349
read on the needle that's how
Scientology that's how scientologists

2236
00:39:12,349 --> 00:39:12,359
Scientology that's how scientologists
 

2237
00:39:12,359 --> 00:39:15,650
Scientology that's how scientologists
believe that's why the needle reads now

2238
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:15,660
believe that's why the needle reads now
 

2239
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,750
believe that's why the needle reads now
cynics would say the needle only reads

2240
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:17,760
cynics would say the needle only reads
 

2241
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,109
cynics would say the needle only reads
on Palm sweat and movement well I know

00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:21,119
on Palm sweat and movement well I know
 

2243
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:22,329
on Palm sweat and movement well I know
that's not true

2244
00:39:22,329 --> 00:39:22,339
that's not true
 

2245
00:39:22,339 --> 00:39:24,950
that's not true
right I can't tell you everything the

2246
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:24,960
right I can't tell you everything the
 

2247
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,349
right I can't tell you everything the
needle does read on but I can tell you

2248
00:39:27,349 --> 00:39:27,359
needle does read on but I can tell you
 

2249
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:30,109
needle does read on but I can tell you
it's not just moving your hands in

2250
00:39:30,109 --> 00:39:30,119
it's not just moving your hands in
 

2251
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:32,210
it's not just moving your hands in
sweaty hands it does correlate to

2252
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:32,220
sweaty hands it does correlate to
 

2253
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:34,609
sweaty hands it does correlate to
thoughts probably some way somehow

2254
00:39:34,609 --> 00:39:34,619
thoughts probably some way somehow
 

2255
00:39:34,619 --> 00:39:36,109
thoughts probably some way somehow
because if it didn't correlate to

2256
00:39:36,109 --> 00:39:36,119
because if it didn't correlate to
 

2257
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:38,270
because if it didn't correlate to
thoughts that this process would be way

2258
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:38,280
thoughts that this process would be way
 

2259
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:41,390
thoughts that this process would be way
way too inefficient because it would it

2260
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:41,400
way too inefficient because it would it
 

2261
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,250
way too inefficient because it would it
would be 200 there there's going to be a

2262
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:43,260
would be 200 there there's going to be a
 

2263
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:45,109
would be 200 there there's going to be a
bunch of people who are just not you're

2264
00:39:45,109 --> 00:39:45,119
bunch of people who are just not you're
 

2265
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:46,730
bunch of people who are just not you're
not going to get the what is it called

2266
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:46,740
not going to get the what is it called
 

2267
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:49,370
not going to get the what is it called
the floating needle like no matter what

2268
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:49,380
the floating needle like no matter what
 

2269
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:51,530
the floating needle like no matter what
I can't explain to you how you get a

2270
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:51,540
I can't explain to you how you get a
 

2271
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:53,089
I can't explain to you how you get a
floating needle but it sure as hell

2272
00:39:53,089 --> 00:39:53,099
floating needle but it sure as hell
 

2273
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:54,890
floating needle but it sure as hell
isn't hand sweat and it sure as hell

2274
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:54,900
isn't hand sweat and it sure as hell
 

2275
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,750
isn't hand sweat and it sure as hell
isn't squeezing the cans right so you

2276
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:56,760
isn't squeezing the cans right so you
 

2277
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,430
isn't squeezing the cans right so you
eventually most people will get to the

2278
00:39:58,430 --> 00:39:58,440
eventually most people will get to the
 

2279
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,050
eventually most people will get to the
floating needle and some you get

2280
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:00,060
floating needle and some you get
 

2281
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:01,550
floating needle and some you get
floating needles there's like a feed

2282
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:01,560
floating needles there's like a feed
 

2283
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,109
floating needles there's like a feed
there probably is a feedback mechanism

2284
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:03,119
there probably is a feedback mechanism
 

2285
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:06,470
there probably is a feedback mechanism
that you will each person realizes how

2286
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:06,480
that you will each person realizes how
 

2287
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,930
that you will each person realizes how
their mind and body yeah because you

2288
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:08,940
their mind and body yeah because you
 

2289
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,609
their mind and body yeah because you
want a resolution right it's probably

2290
00:40:10,609 --> 00:40:10,619
want a resolution right it's probably
 

2291
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:12,290
want a resolution right it's probably
you want your needle to float for both

2292
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:12,300
you want your needle to float for both
 

2293
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,450
you want your needle to float for both
people yes and it's probably a great

2294
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:14,460
people yes and it's probably a great
 

2295
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:16,370
people yes and it's probably a great
experience when you're like yes it's a

2296
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:16,380
experience when you're like yes it's a
 

2297
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,170
experience when you're like yes it's a
gamified feeling right well when you're

2298
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:18,180
gamified feeling right well when you're
 

2299
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,790
gamified feeling right well when you're
training on how to use the e-meter there

2300
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:19,800
training on how to use the e-meter there
 

2301
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,670
training on how to use the e-meter there
are drills where you practice generating

2302
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:22,680
are drills where you practice generating
 

2303
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:25,250
are drills where you practice generating
with your mind various needle reactions

2304
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:25,260
with your mind various needle reactions
 

2305
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,990
with your mind various needle reactions
so you know there is a drill where you

2306
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:27,000
so you know there is a drill where you
 

2307
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,310
so you know there is a drill where you
sit there and you consciously try to

2308
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:28,320
sit there and you consciously try to
 

2309
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,050
sit there and you consciously try to
create a floating needle by recalling

2310
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:30,060
create a floating needle by recalling
 

2311
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:32,810
create a floating needle by recalling

and at the end of every auditing session
 

2315
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,349
and at the end of every auditing session
you actually have to go to an a third

every single auditing session not only
 

2323
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,310
every single auditing session not only
has to end on a floating needle but then

2324
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:43,320
has to end on a floating needle but then
 

2325
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,510
has to end on a floating needle but then
you have to go to someone else and have

you have to go to someone else and have
 

2327
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,370
you have to go to someone else and have
the floating needle verified any

impasse in an auditing session where I
 

2433
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:32,390
impasse in an auditing session where I
was being asked for something I couldn't

was being asked for something I couldn't
 

2435
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,250
was being asked for something I couldn't
provide because I knew this auditing

2436

session has to end on a good point but
 

2439
00:42:36,359 --> 00:42:38,870
session has to end on a good point but
scientologists enjoy for the most part

2440
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:38,880
scientologists enjoy for the most part
 

2441
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,370
scientologists enjoy for the most part
going they call it whole track whole

2442
00:42:40,370 --> 00:42:40,380
going they call it whole track whole
 

2443
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:42,530
going they call it whole track whole
track is past life going whole track

2444
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:42,540
track is past life going whole track
 

2445
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:44,150
track is past life going whole track
your time track they call it the time

2446
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:44,160
your time track they call it the time
 

2447
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,310
your time track they call it the time
track is your whole memory but whole

2448
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:46,320
track is your whole memory but whole
 

2449
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,410
track is your whole memory but whole
track refers to anything past life okay

2450
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:48,420
track refers to anything past life okay
 

2451
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:50,750
track refers to anything past life okay
so going whole track or deep hole track

2452
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:50,760
so going whole track or deep hole track
 

2453
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,849
so going whole track or deep hole track
with high reality meaning it's not like

2454
00:42:52,849 --> 00:42:52,859
with high reality meaning it's not like
 

2455
00:42:52,859 --> 00:42:54,230
with high reality meaning it's not like
oh I have a fuzzy memory and I'm not

2456
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:54,240
oh I have a fuzzy memory and I'm not
 

2457
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,050
oh I have a fuzzy memory and I'm not
sure if it's real like your real season

2458
00:42:56,050 --> 00:42:56,060
sure if it's real like your real season
 

2459
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:58,970
sure if it's real like your real season
scientologists are like oh yeah I was on

2460
00:42:58,970 --> 00:42:58,980
scientologists are like oh yeah I was on
 

2461
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:00,890
scientologists are like oh yeah I was on
this planet oh this time circling this

2462
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:00,900
this planet oh this time circling this
 

2463
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:02,089
this planet oh this time circling this
before that I was eating for breakfast

2464
00:43:02,089 --> 00:43:02,099
before that I was eating for breakfast
 

2465
00:43:02,099 --> 00:43:04,910
before that I was eating for breakfast
fascinating before the origin of life on

2466
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:04,920
fascinating before the origin of life on
 

2467
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:08,930
fascinating before the origin of life on
Earth so so billions of years ago on a

2468
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:08,940
Earth so so billions of years ago on a
 

2469
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:10,550
Earth so so billions of years ago on a
distant planet what you were eating for

2470
00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:10,560
distant planet what you were eating for
 

2471
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,069
distant planet what you were eating for
breakfast or other universes I wonder if

2472
00:43:13,069 --> 00:43:13,079
breakfast or other universes I wonder if
 

2473
00:43:13,079 --> 00:43:16,069
breakfast or other universes I wonder if
that's a nice shortcut

2474
00:43:16,069 --> 00:43:16,079
that's a nice shortcut
 

2475
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:18,230
that's a nice shortcut
to sneak up to actual trauma that

2476
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:18,240
to sneak up to actual trauma that
 

2477
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,569
to sneak up to actual trauma that
happened to you as a therapy device I

2478
00:43:20,569 --> 00:43:20,579
happened to you as a therapy device I
 

2479
00:43:20,579 --> 00:43:22,970
happened to you as a therapy device I
just so putting Scientology aside I just

2480
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:22,980
just so putting Scientology aside I just
 

2481
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:25,250
just so putting Scientology aside I just
I'm thinking about as a technique for

2482
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:25,260
I'm thinking about as a technique for
 

2483
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:28,370
I'm thinking about as a technique for
therapy discussing basically you know

2484
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:28,380
therapy discussing basically you know
 

2485
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:30,050
therapy discussing basically you know
some people have trauma and one of the

2486
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:30,060
some people have trauma and one of the
 

2487
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:31,550
some people have trauma and one of the
things you do with therapy is like bring

2488
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:31,560
things you do with therapy is like bring
 

2489
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,109
things you do with therapy is like bring
the trauma to the surface that's the

2490
00:43:33,109 --> 00:43:33,119
the trauma to the surface that's the
 

2491
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:34,309
the trauma to the surface that's the
stuff that happened to your childhood

2492
00:43:34,309 --> 00:43:34,319
stuff that happened to your childhood
 

2493
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:36,770
stuff that happened to your childhood
maybe it's a more convenient thing to do

2494
00:43:36,770 --> 00:43:36,780
maybe it's a more convenient thing to do
 

2495
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:40,190
maybe it's a more convenient thing to do
to kind of map that indirectly onto a

2496
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:40,200
to kind of map that indirectly onto a
 

2497
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:43,490
to kind of map that indirectly onto a
fictitious telling of what happened to

2498
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:43,500
fictitious telling of what happened to
 

2499
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:44,210
fictitious telling of what happened to
you

2500
00:43:44,210 --> 00:43:44,220
you
 

2501
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:46,309
you
something like that trauma on a distant

2502
00:43:46,309 --> 00:43:46,319
something like that trauma on a distant
 

2503
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:48,349
something like that trauma on a distant
planet elsewhere it could be it could be

2504
00:43:48,349 --> 00:43:48,359
planet elsewhere it could be it could be
 

2505
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:50,450
planet elsewhere it could be it could be
a nice way to sneak up to it yeah and it

2506
00:43:50,450 --> 00:43:50,460
a nice way to sneak up to it yeah and it
 

2507
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:51,770
a nice way to sneak up to it yeah and it
goes both flows there not just things

2508
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:51,780
goes both flows there not just things
 

2509
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:52,670
goes both flows there not just things
that have happened to you but things

2510
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:52,680
that have happened to you but things
 

2511
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:55,309
that have happened to you but things
that you've done so you know you could

2512
00:43:55,309 --> 00:43:55,319
that you've done so you know you could
 

2513
00:43:55,319 --> 00:43:57,470
that you've done so you know you could
be being asked for you know you'd be

going back to I wiped out a civilization
 

2517

going back to I wiped out a civilization
I don't know this race on this planet oh

2518
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:03,540
I don't know this race on this planet oh
 

2519
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,030
I don't know this race on this planet oh
wow oh yeah

2520

horrible person so imagine though if you

00:44:38,930 --> 00:44:38,940
horrible person so imagine though if you
 

2553
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:40,730
horrible person so imagine though if you
had not only are you looking at you know

2554
00:44:40,730 --> 00:44:40,740
had not only are you looking at you know
 

2555
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:42,470
had not only are you looking at you know
if someone's being self-critical trying

2556
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:42,480
if someone's being self-critical trying
 

2557
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,270
if someone's being self-critical trying
to identify destructive patterns of

2558
00:44:44,270 --> 00:44:44,280
to identify destructive patterns of
 

2559
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:45,710
to identify destructive patterns of
behavior in your present life but what

2560
00:44:45,710 --> 00:44:45,720
behavior in your present life but what
 

2561
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,450
behavior in your present life but what
if you really internalize the fact that

2562
00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:47,460
if you really internalize the fact that
 

2563
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:49,790
if you really internalize the fact that
I haven't only been this way

2564
00:44:49,790 --> 00:44:49,800
I haven't only been this way
 

2565
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:52,370
I haven't only been this way
for 40 years I've been this way for 40

2566
00:44:52,370 --> 00:44:52,380
for 40 years I've been this way for 40
 

2567
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:54,470
for 40 years I've been this way for 40
trillion years yeah

2568
00:44:54,470 --> 00:44:54,480
trillion years yeah
 

2569
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:57,710
trillion years yeah
but Scientology would argue

2570
00:44:57,710 --> 00:44:57,720
but Scientology would argue
 

2571
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:01,430
but Scientology would argue
that as a Satan you're inherently good

2572
00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:01,440
that as a Satan you're inherently good
 

2573
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,130
that as a Satan you're inherently good
all things are basically good so the the

2574
00:45:04,130 --> 00:45:04,140
all things are basically good so the the
 

2575
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:05,990
all things are basically good so the the
goal of the auditing procedure there

2576
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:06,000
goal of the auditing procedure there
 

2577
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,730
goal of the auditing procedure there
would be essentially to figure out find

2578
00:45:07,730 --> 00:45:07,740
would be essentially to figure out find
 

2579
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:10,130
would be essentially to figure out find
the moment find what it was that caused

2580
00:45:10,130 --> 00:45:10,140
the moment find what it was that caused
 

2581
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:10,970
the moment find what it was that caused
you

2582
00:45:10,970 --> 00:45:10,980
you
 

2583
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:14,569
you
to make that shift as a being

2584
00:45:14,569 --> 00:45:14,579
to make that shift as a being
 

2585
00:45:14,579 --> 00:45:17,270
to make that shift as a being
to dramatize you know evil intentions

2586
00:45:17,270 --> 00:45:17,280
to dramatize you know evil intentions
 

2587
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,250
to dramatize you know evil intentions
and stuff like that so even if you're

2588
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:19,260
and stuff like that so even if you're
 

2589
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:20,809
and stuff like that so even if you're
going whole track

2590
00:45:20,809 --> 00:45:20,819
going whole track
 

2591
00:45:20,819 --> 00:45:22,430
going whole track
looking at all the horrible things

2592
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:22,440
looking at all the horrible things
 

2593
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,710
looking at all the horrible things
you've done the goal is to find like

2594
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:24,720
you've done the goal is to find like
 

2595
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,450
you've done the goal is to find like
well what happened just prior to that

2596
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:26,460
well what happened just prior to that
 

2597
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:28,370
well what happened just prior to that
what was like the prior confusion and

2598
00:45:28,370 --> 00:45:28,380
what was like the prior confusion and
 

2599
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:29,930
what was like the prior confusion and
what what did you misunderstand just

2600
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:29,940
what what did you misunderstand just
 

2601
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:32,270
what what did you misunderstand just
before that and whatnot so the goal is

2602
00:45:32,270 --> 00:45:32,280
before that and whatnot so the goal is
 

2603
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:34,069
before that and whatnot so the goal is
basically so scientologists after a lot

2604
00:45:34,069 --> 00:45:34,079
basically so scientologists after a lot
 

2605
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,290
basically so scientologists after a lot
of auditing are also convinced that they

2606
00:45:36,290 --> 00:45:36,300
of auditing are also convinced that they
 

2607
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:39,470
of auditing are also convinced that they
have fixed the reason

2608
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:39,480
have fixed the reason
 

2609
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,569
have fixed the reason
for any non-optimum

2610
00:45:41,569 --> 00:45:41,579
for any non-optimum
 

2611
00:45:41,579 --> 00:45:44,089
for any non-optimum
conduct and underlying this is a belief

2612
00:45:44,089 --> 00:45:44,099
conduct and underlying this is a belief
 

2613
00:45:44,099 --> 00:45:47,030
conduct and underlying this is a belief
that at the core we're all good yes

2614
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:47,040
that at the core we're all good yes
 

2615
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,770
that at the core we're all good yes
there's a lot of really powerful ideas

2616
00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:48,780
there's a lot of really powerful ideas

2683
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:02,690
applied 100 correctly well that's kind
of unfalsifiable right yeah because

2684
00:47:02,690 --> 00:47:02,700
of unfalsifiable right yeah because
 

2685

00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:08,640
that's a nice little uh escape hatch to
 

2691
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,970
that's a nice little uh escape hatch to
pull on having a crisis of faith it

go through these motions and
 

2787
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,069
go through these motions and
scientologists one of the reasons

2788
00:48:43,069 --> 00:48:43,079
scientologists one of the reasons

00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:34,609
um this almost just sounds like a
template of a toxic relationship you

2954

template of a toxic relationship you
 

2955

template of a toxic relationship you
know there's a bunch of stuff in this

2956
00:51:35,870 --> 00:51:35,880
know there's a bunch of stuff in this

blocking you off from those negative
 

2965
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,549
blocking you off from those negative
things and they're probably they are

2966
00:51:46,549 --> 00:51:46,559
things and they're probably they are
 

2967
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:48,410
things and they're probably they are
probably negative things but then this

2968
00:51:48,410 --> 00:51:48,420
probably negative things but then this
 

2969
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:51,650
probably negative things but then this
like uh this Freedom starts closing in

2970
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:51,660
like uh this Freedom starts closing in
 

2971
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:54,290
like uh this Freedom starts closing in
to where you can't no longer speak

2972
00:51:54,290 --> 00:51:54,300
to where you can't no longer speak
 

2973
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:57,170

freely think freely act freely and
 

2975
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:58,849
freely think freely act freely and
there's some I mean that's why sort of

2976
00:51:58,849 --> 00:51:58,859
there's some I mean that's why sort of
 

2977
00:51:58,859 --> 00:52:00,890
there's some I mean that's why sort of
power corrupts and absolute power

2978
00:52:00,890 --> 00:52:00,900
power corrupts and absolute power
 

2979
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:02,990
power corrupts and absolute power
corrupts absolutely that person doing

2980
00:52:02,990 --> 00:52:03,000
corrupts absolutely that person doing
 

2981
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,370
corrupts absolutely that person doing
the controlling

2982
00:52:04,370 --> 00:52:04,380
the controlling
 

2983
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:07,130
the controlling
actually starts getting that like

2984
00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:07,140
actually starts getting that like
 

2985
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:09,710
actually starts getting that like
dopamine Rush of the controller that's

2986
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:09,720
dopamine Rush of the controller that's
 

2987
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:12,349
dopamine Rush of the controller that's
exciting and it's a vicious negative

2988
00:52:12,349 --> 00:52:12,359
exciting and it's a vicious negative
 

2989
00:52:12,359 --> 00:52:15,530
exciting and it's a vicious negative
cycle so you start out as it it starts

2990
00:52:15,530 --> 00:52:15,540
cycle so you start out as it it starts
 

2991
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:17,270
cycle so you start out as it it starts
out good because you're trying to do

the math there doesn't make sense if you

00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:35,390
because they traveled that path and they
got the correct information so they

3066
00:53:35,390 --> 00:53:35,400
got the correct information so they
 

3067
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:36,829
got the correct information so they
still create this on they try to create

3068
00:53:36,829 --> 00:53:36,839
still create this on they try to create
 

3069

too much about scientology I was doing a
bunch of reading and the Wikipedia page

3112
00:54:21,829 --> 00:54:21,839
you know you have to be a little bit
 

3113
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:23,150

3115
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:25,309
careful how you consume stuff from
Wikipedia you have to consider because

3116
00:54:25,309 --> 00:54:25,319
Wikipedia you have to consider because
 

3117

3121
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:31,010
there's certain special interests and so
on but like it made me wonder like like

3122
00:54:31,010 --> 00:54:31,020
on but like it made me wonder like like
 

3123
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:33,410
on but like it made me wonder like like
with a lot of controversial topics what

3124
00:54:33,410 --> 00:54:33,420

I go for truth so like how much sort of

3128
00:54:38,270 --> 00:54:38,280
I go for truth so like how much sort of
 

3129
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:40,430
I go for truth so like how much sort of
deliberate action is there to control

3130
00:54:40,430 --> 00:54:40,440
deliberate action is there to control
 

3131
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:42,170
deliberate action is there to control
what is true on the internet by

the way Scientology treats people just a
 

5193
01:31:52,440 --> 01:31:54,770
the way Scientology treats people just a
little bit and you'd probably stop

5194
01:31:54,770 --> 01:31:54,780
little bit and you'd probably stop
 

5195
01:31:54,780 --> 01:31:57,229
little bit and you'd probably stop
losing anyone because scientologists

5196
01:31:57,229 --> 01:31:57,239
losing anyone because scientologists
 

5197
01:31:57,239 --> 01:31:59,810
losing anyone because scientologists
already believed to such a strong degree

5198
01:31:59,810 --> 01:31:59,820
already believed to such a strong degree
 

5199
01:31:59,820 --> 01:32:01,669

to people to make them leave and that's

5202
01:32:03,649 --> 01:32:03,659
to people to make them leave and that's
 

5203
01:32:03,659 --> 01:32:05,570
to people to make them leave and that's
where you go well does miscavich even

5204
01:32:05,570 --> 01:32:05,580
where you go well does miscavich even
 

5205
01:32:05,580 --> 01:32:07,790
where you go well does miscavich even
want Scientology to expand because if he

5206
01:32:07,790 --> 01:32:07,800
want Scientology to expand because if he
 

5207
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:09,050
want Scientology to expand because if he
was really being clever about it it

5208
01:32:09,050 --> 01:32:09,060
was really being clever about it it
 

5209
01:32:09,060 --> 01:32:10,430
was really being clever about it it
seems like he could at least stop the

5210
01:32:10,430 --> 01:32:10,440
seems like he could at least stop the
 

5211
01:32:10,440 --> 01:32:12,770
seems like he could at least stop the
bleeding and yet he doesn't so that's

5212
01:32:12,770 --> 01:32:12,780
bleeding and yet he doesn't so that's
 

5213
01:32:12,780 --> 01:32:13,970
bleeding and yet he doesn't so that's
where you make the argument well if he

5214
01:32:13,970 --> 01:32:13,980
where you make the argument well if he
 

5215
01:32:13,980 --> 01:32:15,649
where you make the argument well if he
doesn't then he must not want to

5216
01:32:15,649 --> 01:32:15,659
doesn't then he must not want to
 

5217
01:32:15,659 --> 01:32:17,750
doesn't then he must not want to
so his mind is corrupted to the point

5218
01:32:17,750 --> 01:32:17,760
so his mind is corrupted to the point
 

5219
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:20,330
so his mind is corrupted to the point
where he's not able to actually be a

5220
01:32:20,330 --> 01:32:20,340
where he's not able to actually be a
 

5221
01:32:20,340 --> 01:32:22,310
where he's not able to actually be a
good businessman essentially it seems

that way

5224
01:32:25,669 --> 01:32:25,679

01:32:33,770 --> 01:32:33,780
very difficult to get to this number but
 

5233
01:32:33,780 --> 01:32:35,930
very difficult to get to this number but
is there a good estimate of what the

5234
01:32:35,930 --> 01:32:35,940
is there a good estimate of what the
 

5235
01:32:35,940 --> 01:32:37,610

and that wasn't even considered
 

5811
01:42:49,020 --> 01:42:51,109
and that wasn't even considered
and I go like

they created this monster
and that's a fact

5816
01:42:56,930 --> 01:42:56,940
and that's a fact
 

5817
01:42:56,940 --> 01:42:59,209
and that's a fact
and that's why I take joy in it

5818
01:42:59,209 --> 01:42:59,219
and that's why I take joy in it
 

5819

and it doesn't have to be that way right
 

5839
01:43:23,460 --> 01:43:25,550

and why is it that way
 

5841
01:43:25,560 --> 01:43:27,890
and why is it that way
I mean it started with L Ron Hubbard

5853
01:43:41,460 --> 01:43:43,129
judgment can be abused in that way I
would make the argument

5854
01:43:43,129 --> 01:43:43,139
would make the argument
 

5855
01:43:43,139 --> 01:43:46,310
would make the argument
that if an anti-broker had taken over

5856

little
 

5861
01:43:51,060 --> 01:43:53,689
little
um caveats baked into it that even the

01:43:53,689 --> 01:43:53,699
um caveats baked into it that even the
 

5863

policies about disconnection could be
 

5865
01:43:55,260 --> 01:43:59,229
policies about disconnection could be
interpreted and implemented in a

there is room for judgment and

5870
01:44:03,050 --> 01:44:03,060
there is room for judgment and
 

5871
01:44:03,060 --> 01:44:04,669
there is room for judgment and

discretion
 

5873
01:44:04,679 --> 01:44:07,430
discretion
and miscavige has just created the worst

5874
01:44:07,430 --> 01:44:07,440
and miscavige has just created the worst
 

5875
01:44:07,440 --> 01:44:09,590
and miscavige has just created the worst
possible version of Scientology and

5876
01:44:09,590 --> 01:44:09,600
possible version of Scientology and
 

5877
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:11,090
possible version of Scientology and
that's that's where you sort of get that

5878
01:44:11,090 --> 01:44:11,100
that's that's where you sort of get that
 

5879
01:44:11,100 --> 01:44:13,070
that's that's where you sort of get that
argument of does he even want

5880
01:44:13,070 --> 01:44:13,080
argument of does he even want
 

5881
01:44:13,080 --> 01:44:14,689
argument of does he even want
scientologies to succeed because he

5882
01:44:14,689 --> 01:44:14,699
scientologies to succeed because he
 

5883
01:44:14,699 --> 01:44:16,609
scientologies to succeed because he
seems to be hell-bent

5884
01:44:16,609 --> 01:44:16,619
seems to be hell-bent
 

5885
01:44:16,619 --> 01:44:20,149
seems to be hell-bent
on making sure that he doesn't

5886
01:44:20,149 --> 01:44:20,159

 

5887
01:44:20,159 --> 01:44:22,490

yeah and and I don't want to see him

5888
01:44:22,490 --> 01:44:22,500
yeah and and I don't want to see him
 

5889
01:44:22,500 --> 01:44:24,770
yeah and and I don't want to see him
make it succeed but it does bring that

5890
01:44:24,770 --> 01:44:24,780
make it succeed but it does bring that
 

5891
01:44:24,780 --> 01:44:26,689
make it succeed but it does bring that
question up of like what are his

5892
01:44:26,689 --> 01:44:26,699
question up of like what are his
 

5893
01:44:26,699 --> 01:44:27,830
question up of like what are his
motivations

5894
01:44:27,830 --> 01:44:27,840
motivations
 

5895
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:29,930
motivations
can he not see that he's destroying the

5896
01:44:29,930 --> 01:44:29,940
can he not see that he's destroying the
 

5897
01:44:29,940 --> 01:44:31,970
can he not see that he's destroying the
thing he's supposed to be expanding

5898
01:44:31,970 --> 01:44:31,980
thing he's supposed to be expanding
 

5899
01:44:31,980 --> 01:44:33,890
thing he's supposed to be expanding
that's also you know there's ways to

5900
01:44:33,890 --> 01:44:33,900
that's also you know there's ways to
 

5901
01:44:33,900 --> 01:44:37,189
that's also you know there's ways to
measure cost

5902
01:44:37,189 --> 01:44:37,199
measure cost
 

5903
01:44:37,199 --> 01:44:40,250
measure cost
and that would probably be the most

5904
01:44:40,250 --> 01:44:40,260
and that would probably be the most
 

5905
01:44:40,260 --> 01:44:43,550
and that would probably be the most
costly aspect of Scientology is the

5906
01:44:43,550 --> 01:44:43,560
costly aspect of Scientology is the
 

5907
01:44:43,560 --> 01:44:45,290
costly aspect of Scientology is the
suffering associated with the separating

5908
01:44:45,290 --> 01:44:45,300
suffering associated with the separating
 

5909
01:44:45,300 --> 01:44:47,390
suffering associated with the separating
of families yeah I mean that's actually

5910
01:44:47,390 --> 01:44:47,400
of families yeah I mean that's actually
 

5911
01:44:47,400 --> 01:44:50,270
of families yeah I mean that's actually
just puts make it's a very concrete what

5912
01:44:50,270 --> 01:44:50,280
just puts make it's a very concrete what
 

5913
01:44:50,280 --> 01:44:52,250
just puts make it's a very concrete what
we value in human life

5914
01:44:52,250 --> 01:44:52,260
we value in human life
 

5915
01:44:52,260 --> 01:44:54,890
we value in human life
is the connection to our loved ones like

5916
01:44:54,890 --> 01:44:54,900
is the connection to our loved ones like
 

5917
01:44:54,900 --> 01:44:56,090
is the connection to our loved ones like
everything else doesn't matter like

5918
01:44:56,090 --> 01:44:56,100
everything else doesn't matter like
 

5919
01:44:56,100 --> 01:44:58,609
everything else doesn't matter like
getting 50 bucks a week

5920
01:44:58,609 --> 01:44:58,619
getting 50 bucks a week
 

5921
01:44:58,619 --> 01:45:00,290
getting 50 bucks a week
uh

5922
01:45:00,290 --> 01:45:00,300
uh
 

5923
01:45:00,300 --> 01:45:03,950
uh
like that like uh getting money stolen

5924
01:45:03,950 --> 01:45:03,960
like that like uh getting money stolen
 

5925
01:45:03,960 --> 01:45:06,830
like that like uh getting money stolen
from you getting the truth stolen from

5926
01:45:06,830 --> 01:45:06,840
from you getting the truth stolen from
 

5927
01:45:06,840 --> 01:45:09,530
from you getting the truth stolen from
you none of that compares

5928
01:45:09,530 --> 01:45:09,540
you none of that compares
 

5929
01:45:09,540 --> 01:45:11,510
you none of that compares
uh you can even frame that as the good

5930
01:45:11,510 --> 01:45:11,520
uh you can even frame that as the good
 

5931
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:13,250
uh you can even frame that as the good
there could be a lot of positives

5932
01:45:13,250 --> 01:45:13,260
there could be a lot of positives
 

5933
01:45:13,260 --> 01:45:15,890
there could be a lot of positives
whatever in the tribe but separating

5934
01:45:15,890 --> 01:45:15,900
whatever in the tribe but separating
 

5935
01:45:15,900 --> 01:45:17,750
whatever in the tribe but separating
families separating loved ones that's

5936
01:45:17,750 --> 01:45:17,760
families separating loved ones that's
 

5937
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:19,910
families separating loved ones that's
the destructive thing

5938
01:45:19,910 --> 01:45:19,920
the destructive thing
 

5939
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:22,850
the destructive thing
so no hate though no I genuinely don't

5940

02:02:42,360 --> 02:02:44,689
that there's some you know it's like uh
it's it's a feedback loop where if you

6912
02:02:44,689 --> 02:02:44,699
it's it's a feedback loop where if you
 

6913
02:02:44,699 --> 02:02:46,310
it's it's a feedback loop where if you
have the confidence and you push on

not let fear see pen and affect you it

6918

not let fear see pen and affect you it

it might be a very difficult stuff to
 

6927
02:03:01,020 --> 02:03:05,089
it might be a very difficult stuff to
take to talk about publicly the fear was

6928
02:03:05,089 --> 02:03:05,099
take to talk about publicly the fear was
 

6929
02:03:05,099 --> 02:03:06,950
take to talk about publicly the fear was
knowing how the family was going to be

6930
