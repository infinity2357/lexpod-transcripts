171
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:57,670
like their signals are on a totally
different time scale

172
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:57,680
different time scale
 

173
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,149
different time scale
or like a totally different kind of

174
00:03:00,149 --> 00:03:00,159
or like a totally different kind of
 

175
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,750
or like a totally different kind of
medium communication

176
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:01,760
medium communication
 

177
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,790
medium communication
it could be it could be our own it could

178
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:04,800
it could be it could be our own it could
 

179
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,670
it could be it could be our own it could
be the birth

180
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:05,680
be the birth
 

181
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,430
be the birth
of like human beings like

182
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:09,440
of like human beings like
 

183
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,149
of like human beings like
that the whatever the magic that makes

184
00:03:12,149 --> 00:03:12,159
that the whatever the magic that makes
 

185
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:12,710
that the whatever the magic that makes
us

186
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:12,720
us
 

187
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,390
us
who we are the collective intelligence

188
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:14,400
who we are the collective intelligence
 

189
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,070
who we are the collective intelligence
thing that could be

190
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:16,080
thing that could be
 

191
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,070
thing that could be
aliens themselves that could be the

192
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:18,080
aliens themselves that could be the
 

193
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,430
aliens themselves that could be the
medium communication

194
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:19,440
medium communication
 

195
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,350
medium communication
like the nature of our consciousness and

196
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:21,360
like the nature of our consciousness and
 

197
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,949
like the nature of our consciousness and
intelligence itself is the medium of

198
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:22,959
intelligence itself is the medium of
 

199
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,070
intelligence itself is the medium of
communication

200
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:24,080
communication
 

201
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,509
communication
and like being able to ask the questions

202
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:27,519
and like being able to ask the questions
 

203
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,910
and like being able to ask the questions
themselves i've never thought of it that

204
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:29,920
themselves i've never thought of it that
 

205
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,430
themselves i've never thought of it that
way like actually yeah

206
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:31,440
way like actually yeah
 

207
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,430
way like actually yeah
asking the question whether aliens exist

208
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:33,440
asking the question whether aliens exist
 

209
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,030
asking the question whether aliens exist
might be the very medium by which they

210
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:35,040
might be the very medium by which they
 

211
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,750
might be the very medium by which they
communicate

212
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:35,760
communicate
 

213
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,789
communicate
it's like they they send questions so

214
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:38,799
it's like they they send questions so
 

215
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,750
it's like they they send questions so
some this like collective emergent

216
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:41,760
some this like collective emergent
 

217
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,630
some this like collective emergent
behavior

218
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:42,640
behavior
 

219
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,470
behavior
is is the signal is the signal yeah

220
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:46,480
is is the signal is the signal yeah
 

221
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,190
is is the signal is the signal yeah
so interesting yeah because maybe that's

222
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:49,200
so interesting yeah because maybe that's
 

223
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,710
so interesting yeah because maybe that's
how we would communicate with if you

224
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:50,720
how we would communicate with if you
 

225
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,229
how we would communicate with if you
think about if we were way way way

226
00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:52,239
think about if we were way way way
 

227
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:53,270
think about if we were way way way
smarter

228
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:53,280
smarter
 

229
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,710
smarter
like a thousand years from now we

230
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:54,720
like a thousand years from now we
 

231
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,949
like a thousand years from now we
somehow survive like how would we

232
00:03:56,949 --> 00:03:56,959
somehow survive like how would we
 

233
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,110
somehow survive like how would we
actually communicate

234
00:03:59,110 --> 00:03:59,120
actually communicate
 

235
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,390
actually communicate
in a way that's like if we broadcast the

236
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:02,400
in a way that's like if we broadcast the
 

237
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,830
in a way that's like if we broadcast the
signal

238
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:03,840
signal
 

239
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,030
signal
you know and then it could somehow like

240
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,040
you know and then it could somehow like
 

241
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,869
you know and then it could somehow like
percolate throughout the universe

242
00:04:08,869 --> 00:04:08,879
percolate throughout the universe
 

243
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,670
percolate throughout the universe
like that signal having an impact

244
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:11,680
like that signal having an impact
 

245
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,309
like that signal having an impact
multiverse of course

246
00:04:14,309 --> 00:04:14,319
multiverse of course
 

247
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,509
multiverse of course
uh that would have a signal an effect on

248
00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:17,519
uh that would have a signal an effect on
 

249
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,550
uh that would have a signal an effect on
the most possible

250
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:18,560
the most possible
 

251
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,069
the most possible
the most the highest number of possible

252
00:04:20,069 --> 00:04:20,079
the most the highest number of possible
 

253
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,390
the most the highest number of possible
civilizations what would that signal be

254
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:22,400
civilizations what would that signal be
 

255
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,990
civilizations what would that signal be
it might not be like sending a few like

256
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:26,000
it might not be like sending a few like
 

257
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,150
it might not be like sending a few like
stupid little hello world messages it

258
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:28,160
stupid little hello world messages it
 

259
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,310
stupid little hello world messages it
might be something more

260
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:30,320
might be something more
 

261
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,550
might be something more
impactful what it's almost like

262
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:34,560
impactful what it's almost like
 

263
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,270
impactful what it's almost like
impactful in a way where they don't have

264
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:37,280
impactful in a way where they don't have
 

265
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,150
impactful in a way where they don't have
to

266
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:38,160
to
 

267
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,469
to
have the capability to hear it it like

268
00:04:40,469 --> 00:04:40,479
have the capability to hear it it like
 

269
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,629
have the capability to hear it it like
forces the message to have an impact

270
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:42,639
forces the message to have an impact
 

271
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,990
forces the message to have an impact
right my train of thought has never gone

272
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:46,000
right my train of thought has never gone
 

273
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,030
right my train of thought has never gone
gone there but i like it and

274
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:49,040
gone there but i like it and
 

275
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,790
gone there but i like it and
also somewhere in there i think it's

276
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:50,800
also somewhere in there i think it's
 

277
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,550
also somewhere in there i think it's
implied that

278
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:52,560
implied that
 

279
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,230
implied that
something travels faster than the speed

280
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:54,240
something travels faster than the speed
 

281
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,469
something travels faster than the speed
of light which i'm also

282
00:04:56,469 --> 00:04:56,479
of light which i'm also
 

283
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,430
of light which i'm also
really hopeful for oh you're hopeful are

284
00:04:59,430 --> 00:04:59,440
really hopeful for oh you're hopeful are
 

285
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,390
really hopeful for oh you're hopeful are
you excited

286
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:00,400
you excited
 

287
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,230
you excited
by the possibility that there's

288
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:02,240
by the possibility that there's
 

289
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,909
by the possibility that there's
intelligent life out there

290
00:05:03,909 --> 00:05:03,919
intelligent life out there
 

291
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,110
intelligent life out there
sort of you work on on the engineering

292
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:07,120
sort of you work on on the engineering
 

293
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:07,909
sort of you work on on the engineering
side of things

294
00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:07,919
side of things
 

295
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,790
side of things
it's this very kind of focused pursuit

296
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:10,800
it's this very kind of focused pursuit
 

297
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,110
it's this very kind of focused pursuit
of

298
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:11,120
of
 

299
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,070
of
uh moving things through space

300
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:14,080
uh moving things through space
 

301
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,749
uh moving things through space
efficiently

302
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:15,759
efficiently
 

303
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,790
efficiently
but you know if you zoom out one of the

304
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:18,800
but you know if you zoom out one of the
 

305
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,550
but you know if you zoom out one of the
cool things that this enables us to do

306
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:20,560
cool things that this enables us to do
 

307
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,430
cool things that this enables us to do
is

308
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:21,440
is
 

309
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,909
is
find or get even intelligent life just

310
00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:23,919
find or get even intelligent life just
 

311
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:24,710
find or get even intelligent life just
life

312
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:24,720
life
 

313
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,990
life
on mars on europa or something like that

314
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:28,000
on mars on europa or something like that
 

315
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,510
on mars on europa or something like that
does that excite you does that scare you

316
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:31,520
does that excite you does that scare you
 

317
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,350
does that excite you does that scare you
oh it's very exciting i mean it's the

318
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:33,360
oh it's very exciting i mean it's the
 

319
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,029
oh it's very exciting i mean it's the
whole reason i

320
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:35,039
whole reason i
 

321
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,310
whole reason i
went into the field i'm in is

322
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:38,320
went into the field i'm in is
 

323
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,590
went into the field i'm in is
to contribute to building the body of

324
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:41,600
to contribute to building the body of
 

325
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,590
to contribute to building the body of
knowledge that we have as a species

326
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:45,600
knowledge that we have as a species
 

327
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,990
knowledge that we have as a species
um so very exciting do you think there's

328
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:48,000
um so very exciting do you think there's
 

329
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,310
um so very exciting do you think there's
life on mars

330
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:50,320
life on mars
 

331
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,430
life on mars
i like uh no longer well

332
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:53,440
i like uh no longer well
 

333
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,590
i like uh no longer well
already living but at currently living

334
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:55,600
already living but at currently living
 

335
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,189
already living but at currently living
but also no longer living

336
00:05:57,189 --> 00:05:57,199
but also no longer living
 

337
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,510
but also no longer living
like that we might be able to find life

338
00:05:59,510 --> 00:05:59,520
like that we might be able to find life
 

339
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,950
like that we might be able to find life
as some people suspect

340
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:00,960
as some people suspect
 

341
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,990
as some people suspect
basic microbial life i'm not

342
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:04,000
basic microbial life i'm not
 

343
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,189
basic microbial life i'm not
so sure about in our own solar system

344
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:07,199
so sure about in our own solar system
 

345
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,510
so sure about in our own solar system
and and i do think it might be hard to

346
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:09,520
and and i do think it might be hard to
 

347
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,230
and and i do think it might be hard to
untangle

348
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:10,240
untangle
 

349
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,670
untangle
if we somehow contaminated other things

350
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:13,680
if we somehow contaminated other things
 

351
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,270
if we somehow contaminated other things
as well uh so i'm not sure about

352
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:17,280
as well uh so i'm not sure about
 

353
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,510
as well uh so i'm not sure about
this close to home that would be really

354
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:19,520
this close to home that would be really
 

355
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,390
this close to home that would be really
exciting

356
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:20,400
exciting
 

357
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,230
exciting
yes like do you think about the drake

358
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:22,240
yes like do you think about the drake
 

359
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,629
yes like do you think about the drake
equation much of what that was what

360
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:24,639
equation much of what that was what
 

361
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,390
equation much of what that was what
yeah what got me into all of this yeah

362
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:28,400
yeah what got me into all of this yeah
 

363
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,550
yeah what got me into all of this yeah
yeah because uh one of the questions is

364
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:30,560
yeah because uh one of the questions is
 

365
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,430
yeah because uh one of the questions is
how hard is it

366
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:31,440
how hard is it
 

367
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,070
how hard is it
for life to start on a habitable planet

368
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:34,080
for life to start on a habitable planet
 

369
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,590
for life to start on a habitable planet
like if you have a lot of the basic

370
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:35,600
like if you have a lot of the basic
 

371
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,230
like if you have a lot of the basic
conditions

372
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:36,240
conditions
 

373
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,629
conditions
not exactly like earth but basic

374
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:38,639
not exactly like earth but basic
 

375
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,390
not exactly like earth but basic
earth-like conditions how hard is it for

376
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:40,400
earth-like conditions how hard is it for
 

377
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,430
earth-like conditions how hard is it for
life to start

378
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:41,440
life to start
 

379
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,749
life to start
and if you find life on mars or find

380
00:06:43,749 --> 00:06:43,759
and if you find life on mars or find
 

381
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,070
and if you find life on mars or find
life on europa

382
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:46,080
life on europa
 

383
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,029
life on europa
that means it's way easier that's a good

384
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:49,039
that means it's way easier that's a good
 

385
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,870
that means it's way easier that's a good
thing to confirm that

386
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:50,880
thing to confirm that
 

387
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,749
thing to confirm that
if you have a habitable planet then

388
00:06:53,749 --> 00:06:53,759
if you have a habitable planet then
 

389
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,430
if you have a habitable planet then
there's going to be life

390
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:55,440
there's going to be life
 

391
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,670
there's going to be life
and that like immediately that's that

392
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:57,680
and that like immediately that's that
 

393
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,950
and that like immediately that's that
would be super exciting because that

394
00:06:58,950 --> 00:06:58,960
would be super exciting because that
 

395
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,830
would be super exciting because that
means

396
00:06:59,830 --> 00:06:59,840
means
 

397
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,550
means
there's like trillions of planets yeah

398
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:02,560
there's like trillions of planets yeah
 

399
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,550
there's like trillions of planets yeah
basic life out there

400
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:04,560
basic life out there
 

401
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,790
basic life out there
though of all the planets in our solar

402
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:06,800
though of all the planets in our solar
 

403
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,550
though of all the planets in our solar
system earth is clearly the most

404
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:08,560
system earth is clearly the most
 

405
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,309
system earth is clearly the most
habitable so i would not be discouraged

406
00:07:12,309 --> 00:07:12,319
habitable so i would not be discouraged
 

407
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,270
habitable so i would not be discouraged
if we didn't find it on another planet

408
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:15,280
if we didn't find it on another planet
 

409
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,749
if we didn't find it on another planet
in our solar system true and again that

410
00:07:17,749 --> 00:07:17,759
in our solar system true and again that
 

411
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,110
in our solar system true and again that
life could look very different it's

412
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:19,120
life could look very different it's
 

413
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,870
life could look very different it's
habitable for earth-like life right

414
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:20,880
habitable for earth-like life right
 

415
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,589
habitable for earth-like life right
but it could be totally different i

416
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:23,599
but it could be totally different i
 

417
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:24,950
but it could be totally different i
still think that trees

418
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:24,960
still think that trees
 

419
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,469
still think that trees
are quite possibly more intelligent than

420
00:07:26,469 --> 00:07:26,479
are quite possibly more intelligent than
 

421
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,550
are quite possibly more intelligent than
humans but their intelligence

422
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:28,560
humans but their intelligence
 

423
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,189
humans but their intelligence
is carried out over time scale that

424
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:31,199
is carried out over time scale that
 

425
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,870
is carried out over time scale that
we're just not able to appreciate

426
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:32,880
we're just not able to appreciate
 

427
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,469
we're just not able to appreciate
like they might be running the entirety

428
00:07:34,469 --> 00:07:34,479
like they might be running the entirety
 

429
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,150
like they might be running the entirety
of human civilization

430
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:36,160
of human civilization
 

431
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,390
of human civilization
and we're just like too dumb to realize

432
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:38,400
and we're just like too dumb to realize
 

433
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,230
and we're just like too dumb to realize
that they're they're the smart ones

434
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:40,240
that they're they're the smart ones
 

435
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,430
that they're they're the smart ones
maybe that's the alien message

436
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:43,440
maybe that's the alien message
 

437
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,790
maybe that's the alien message
it's in the trees the trees

438
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:46,800
it's in the trees the trees
 

439
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,510
it's in the trees the trees
uh yeah it's not in the uh monolith in

440
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:49,520
uh yeah it's not in the uh monolith in
 

441
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,869
uh yeah it's not in the uh monolith in
the utah deserts and the trees

442
00:07:50,869 --> 00:07:50,879
the utah deserts and the trees
 

443
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,670
the utah deserts and the trees
right yeah so let's go to space

444
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:53,680
right yeah so let's go to space
 

445
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,950
right yeah so let's go to space
exploration

446
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:54,960
exploration
 

447
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,309
exploration
how do you think it would get humans to

448
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:56,319
how do you think it would get humans to
 

449
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,950
how do you think it would get humans to
mars i i think spacex and

450
00:07:58,950 --> 00:07:58,960
mars i i think spacex and
 

451
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,990
mars i i think spacex and
and elon musk will be the ones that

452
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:02,000
and elon musk will be the ones that
 

453
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,110
and elon musk will be the ones that
get the first human setting foot on

454
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:05,120
get the first human setting foot on
 

455
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,510
get the first human setting foot on
mars uh and probably not that long from

456
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:09,520
mars uh and probably not that long from
 

457
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,309
mars uh and probably not that long from
now from us having this conversation you

458
00:08:12,309 --> 00:08:12,319
now from us having this conversation you
 

459
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,390
now from us having this conversation you
know maybe we'll inflate his timeline a

460
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:14,400
know maybe we'll inflate his timeline a
 

461
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,070
know maybe we'll inflate his timeline a
little bit but i tend to

462
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:16,080
little bit but i tend to
 

463
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,350
little bit but i tend to
believe um the goals he sets so

464
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:19,360
believe um the goals he sets so
 

465
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,830
believe um the goals he sets so
i think that will happen relatively soon

466
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:21,840
i think that will happen relatively soon
 

467
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,189
i think that will happen relatively soon
um as far as

468
00:08:23,189 --> 00:08:23,199
um as far as
 

469
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,029
um as far as
you know when and what it will take to

470
00:08:25,029 --> 00:08:25,039
you know when and what it will take to
 

471
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,110
you know when and what it will take to
get humans living there

472
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:27,120
get humans living there
 

473
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,390
get humans living there
in a more permanent way um

474
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:30,400
in a more permanent way um
 

475
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,389
in a more permanent way um
you know i have a glib answer which is

476
00:08:32,389 --> 00:08:32,399
you know i have a glib answer which is
 

477
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,670
you know i have a glib answer which is
you know when we can

478
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:33,680
you know when we can
 

479
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,790
you know when we can
invent a time machine to go back to

480
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:36,800
invent a time machine to go back to
 

481
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,990
invent a time machine to go back to
the early cold war and instead of

482
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:40,000
the early cold war and instead of
 

483
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,750
the early cold war and instead of
uniting around sending people to the

484
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:41,760
uniting around sending people to the
 

485
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,469
uniting around sending people to the
moon

486
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:42,479
moon
 

487
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,590
moon
um we pick mars as the destination

488
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:45,600
um we pick mars as the destination
 

489
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,750
um we pick mars as the destination
so really you know i say that because

490
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:47,760
so really you know i say that because
 

491
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,829
so really you know i say that because
there's nothing

492
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:49,839
there's nothing
 

493
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,750
there's nothing
truly scientifically or technologically

494
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:53,760
truly scientifically or technologically
 

495
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,590
truly scientifically or technologically
impossible about doing that soon

496
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:57,600
impossible about doing that soon
 

497
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,829
impossible about doing that soon
it's more you know politically and

498
00:08:59,829 --> 00:08:59,839
it's more you know politically and
 

499
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:00,790
it's more you know politically and
financially

500
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:00,800
financially

private sector can
 

599
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,550
private sector can
support that and but i don't

we'll talk about satellites there's
 

615
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,389

probably a lot of

probably a lot of
 

617
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,790
probably a lot of
business models around satellites but

618
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:14,800
business models around satellites but
 

619
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,310
business models around satellites but
there's not enough

620
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:16,320
there's not enough
 

621
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,710
there's not enough
short-term business i guess that's how

622
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:18,720
short-term business i guess that's how
 

623
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,110
short-term business i guess that's how
business works like you should have

business works like you should have
 

625
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,870

you should have a path to making money
 

627
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,030
you should have a path to making money
in like the next 10 years

00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:25,040
in like the next 10 years
 

629
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,710
in like the next 10 years
well and maybe even

630
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:28,720
well and maybe even
 

631
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,710
well and maybe even
more broadly and and looping back to

i don't know that getting humans off

00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:36,720
i don't know that getting humans off
 

637
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,310
i don't know that getting humans off
this planet and you know spreading

this planet and you know spreading
 

639
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,590

um like bacteria is what we're supposed

640
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:43,600
um like bacteria is what we're supposed
 

641
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,230
um like bacteria is what we're supposed
to be

642
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:44,240
to be
 

643
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,430
to be
doing in the first place so maybe we can

644
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:47,440
doing in the first place so maybe we can
 

645
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,069
doing in the first place so maybe we can
go but

646
00:11:48,069 --> 00:11:48,079
go but
 

647
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:52,069
go but
should we and and i'm probably a an

648
00:11:52,069 --> 00:11:52,079
should we and and i'm probably a an
 

649
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,509
should we and and i'm probably a an
unusual person for thinking that in my

650
00:11:55,509 --> 00:11:55,519
unusual person for thinking that in my
 

651
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,150
unusual person for thinking that in my
industry

652
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:56,160
industry
 

653
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,190
industry
because humans want to explore

654
00:11:59,190 --> 00:11:59,200
because humans want to explore
 

655
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,910
because humans want to explore
but i almost wonder you know are we

656
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:01,920
but i almost wonder you know are we
 

657
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,750
but i almost wonder you know are we
putting unnecessary obstacles

658
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:03,760
putting unnecessary obstacles
 

659
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,870
putting unnecessary obstacles
like uh we're very finicky biological

660
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:06,880
like uh we're very finicky biological
 

661
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,069
like uh we're very finicky biological
things in the way of some more robotic

662
00:12:10,069 --> 00:12:10,079
things in the way of some more robotic
 

663
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,110
things in the way of some more robotic
or you know more silicon based

664
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:13,120
or you know more silicon based
 

665
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,350
or you know more silicon based
exploration um and yeah do we need to

666
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:17,360
exploration um and yeah do we need to
 

667
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,470
exploration um and yeah do we need to
colonize and spread i'm not sure what do

668
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:20,480
colonize and spread i'm not sure what do
 

669
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,790
colonize and spread i'm not sure what do
you think is the role of ai in space

670
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:22,800
you think is the role of ai in space
 

671
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,110
you think is the role of ai in space
do you uh in your work again we'll talk

672
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:25,120
do you uh in your work again we'll talk
 

673
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,629
do you uh in your work again we'll talk
about it but

674
00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:26,639
about it but
 

675
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,990
about it but
do you see more and more of the

676
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:30,000
do you see more and more of the
 

677
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,590
do you see more and more of the
space vehicles spacecraft

678
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:33,600
space vehicles spacecraft
 

679
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,829
space vehicles spacecraft
being run by artificial intelligence

680
00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:35,839
being run by artificial intelligence
 

681
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,350
being run by artificial intelligence
systems

682
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:37,360
systems
 

683
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,030
systems
more than just like the flight control

684
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:39,040
more than just like the flight control
 

685
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,870
more than just like the flight control
but like the management

686
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:40,880
but like the management
 

687
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,350
but like the management
yeah i don't have a lot of color to the

688
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:43,360
yeah i don't have a lot of color to the
 

689
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,350
yeah i don't have a lot of color to the
dreams i have about way in the future

690
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:45,360
dreams i have about way in the future
 

691
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,710
dreams i have about way in the future
and ai but i do think

692
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:48,720
and ai but i do think
 

693
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,990
and ai but i do think
that removing you know it's hard

694
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:52,000
that removing you know it's hard
 

695
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,629
that removing you know it's hard
for humans to even make a trip to mars

696
00:12:54,629 --> 00:12:54,639
for humans to even make a trip to mars
 

697
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,310
for humans to even make a trip to mars
much less go anywhere

698
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:56,320
much less go anywhere
 

699
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,910
much less go anywhere
farther than that and i think

700
00:12:59,910 --> 00:12:59,920
farther than that and i think
 

701
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,269
farther than that and i think
we'll have you know more this

702
00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:03,279
we'll have you know more this
 

703
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,350
we'll have you know more this
again i'm probably unusual in having

704
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:05,360
again i'm probably unusual in having
 

705
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,790
again i'm probably unusual in having
these thoughts but

706
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:06,800
these thoughts but
 

707
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,870
these thoughts but
perhaps be able to to generate more

708
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:08,880
perhaps be able to to generate more
 

709
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,389
perhaps be able to to generate more
knowledge and understand more

710
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:10,399
knowledge and understand more
 

711
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,110
knowledge and understand more
if we stop trying to send humans and

712
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:13,120
if we stop trying to send humans and
 

713
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:13,829
if we stop trying to send humans and
instead

714
00:13:13,829 --> 00:13:13,839
instead
 

715
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,350
instead
you know i don't know if we're talking

716
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:15,360
you know i don't know if we're talking
 

717
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,670
you know i don't know if we're talking
about ai

718
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:17,680
about ai
 

719
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,750
about ai
in a truly you know artificial

720
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:19,760
in a truly you know artificial
 

721
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,430
in a truly you know artificial
intelligence way or ai as

722
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:21,440
intelligence way or ai as
 

723
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,710
intelligence way or ai as
as we kind of use it today but maybe

724
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:24,720
as we kind of use it today but maybe
 

725
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,590
as we kind of use it today but maybe
sending a

726
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:25,600
sending a
 

727
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,949
sending a
petri dish or two of like stem cells

728
00:13:28,949 --> 00:13:28,959
petri dish or two of like stem cells
 

729
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,150
petri dish or two of like stem cells
and some robotic handlers instead if we

730
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:32,160
and some robotic handlers instead if we
 

731
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,190
and some robotic handlers instead if we
still need to send

732
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:33,200
still need to send
 

733
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,870
still need to send
our dna because we're really stuck on

734
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:34,880
our dna because we're really stuck on
 

735
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,030
our dna because we're really stuck on
that but if not

736
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:37,040
that but if not
 

737
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,910
that but if not
you know maybe not even that petri dish

738
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:39,920
you know maybe not even that petri dish
 

739
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,870
you know maybe not even that petri dish
so i see

740
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:40,880
so i see
 

741
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,470
so i see
i think what i'm saying is you know i

742
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:42,480
i think what i'm saying is you know i
 

743
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,870
i think what i'm saying is you know i
see a much bigger role in the future of

744
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:44,880
see a much bigger role in the future of
 

745
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,949
see a much bigger role in the future of
ai for space exploration

746
00:13:46,949 --> 00:13:46,959
ai for space exploration
 

747
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,150
ai for space exploration
it's kind of sad to think that uh i mean

748
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:50,160
it's kind of sad to think that uh i mean
 

749
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,350
it's kind of sad to think that uh i mean
i'm sure we'll eventually

750
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:51,360
i'm sure we'll eventually
 

751
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,470
i'm sure we'll eventually
send a spacecraft with uh

752
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:54,480
send a spacecraft with uh
 

753
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,910
send a spacecraft with uh
efficient propulsion like some of the

754
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:55,920
efficient propulsion like some of the
 

755
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,550
efficient propulsion like some of the
stuff you work on out that travels just

756
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:58,560
stuff you work on out that travels just
 

757
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,350
stuff you work on out that travels just
really far

758
00:13:59,350 --> 00:13:59,360
really far
 

759
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,829
really far
with some robots on it and with some

760
00:14:01,829 --> 00:14:01,839
with some robots on it and with some
 

761
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:03,110
with some robots on it and with some
with some dna

762
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:03,120
with some dna
 

763
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,910
with some dna
in a petri dish and then human

764
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:05,920
in a petri dish and then human
 

765
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,470
in a petri dish and then human
civilization destroys itself

766
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:08,480
civilization destroys itself
 

767
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,230
civilization destroys itself
and then they'll just be this floating

768
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:10,240
and then they'll just be this floating
 

769
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,189
and then they'll just be this floating
spacecraft that eventually get somewhere

770
00:14:13,189 --> 00:14:13,199
spacecraft that eventually get somewhere
 

771
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,350
spacecraft that eventually get somewhere
or not that's a sad thought like this

772
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:15,360
or not that's a sad thought like this
 

773
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,269
or not that's a sad thought like this
lonely spacecraft just kind of traveling

774
00:14:17,269 --> 00:14:17,279
lonely spacecraft just kind of traveling
 

775
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,470
lonely spacecraft just kind of traveling
through space

776
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:18,480
through space
 

777
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,750
through space
and humans are all dead well

778
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:21,760
and humans are all dead well
 

779
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,030
and humans are all dead well
it depends on what the what the goal is

780
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:25,040
it depends on what the what the goal is
 

781
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,870
it depends on what the what the goal is
right another way to look at it is we've

782
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:28,880
right another way to look at it is we've
 

783
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,470
right another way to look at it is we've
preserved it's like a little time

784
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:30,480
preserved it's like a little time
 

785
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,350
preserved it's like a little time
capsule of

786
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:31,360
capsule of
 

787
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,389
capsule of
knowledge dna you know that we've

788
00:14:34,389 --> 00:14:34,399
knowledge dna you know that we've
 

789
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,110
knowledge dna you know that we've
that will outlive us that's beautiful

790
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:37,120
that will outlive us that's beautiful
 

791
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,670
that will outlive us that's beautiful
yeah

792
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:39,680

 

793
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,750

that's how i sleep at night so you also

794
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:41,760
that's how i sleep at night so you also
 

795
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,870
that's how i sleep at night so you also
mentioned that you wanted to be an

796
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:42,880
mentioned that you wanted to be an
 

797
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,670
mentioned that you wanted to be an
astronaut

798
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:43,680
astronaut
 

799
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,870
astronaut
yes so even though you said you're

800
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:46,880
yes so even though you said you're
 

801
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,629
yes so even though you said you're
unusual and thinking like

802
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:48,639
unusual and thinking like
 

803
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,110
unusual and thinking like
it's nice here on earth and then we

804
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:51,120
it's nice here on earth and then we
 

805
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,829
it's nice here on earth and then we
might want to be sending robots up there

806
00:14:53,829 --> 00:14:53,839
might want to be sending robots up there
 

807
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,829
might want to be sending robots up there
you wanted to be a human that goes out

808
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:56,839
you wanted to be a human that goes out
 

809
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:58,069
you wanted to be a human that goes out
there

810
00:14:58,069 --> 00:14:58,079
there
 

811
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,350
there
would you like to one day travel to mars

812
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:01,360
would you like to one day travel to mars
 

813
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,150
would you like to one day travel to mars
you know if it's if it becomes sort of

814
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:04,160
you know if it's if it becomes sort of
 

815
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,030
you know if it's if it becomes sort of
more open to

816
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:05,040
more open to
 

817
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,110
more open to
civilian travel and that kind of thing

818
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:07,120
civilian travel and that kind of thing
 

819
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,629
civilian travel and that kind of thing
like are you uh

820
00:15:08,629 --> 00:15:08,639
like are you uh
 

821
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,790
like are you uh
like vacation wise like if you talk if

822
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:10,800
like vacation wise like if you talk if
 

823
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,230
like vacation wise like if you talk if
we're talking vacations

824
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:12,240
we're talking vacations
 

825
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,829
we're talking vacations
would you like to vocation on earth or

826
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:13,839
would you like to vocation on earth or
 

827
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:15,269
would you like to vocation on earth or
vacation on mars

828
00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:15,279
vacation on mars
 

829
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:20,150
vacation on mars
i wish that i had a better answer but no

830
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:20,160
i wish that i had a better answer but no
 

831
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,550
i wish that i had a better answer but no
i wanted to be an astronaut because i

832
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:24,560
i wanted to be an astronaut because i
 

833
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,189
i wanted to be an astronaut because i
first of all i like working in labs and

834
00:15:27,189 --> 00:15:27,199
first of all i like working in labs and
 

835
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,350
first of all i like working in labs and
doing experiments and

836
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:29,360
doing experiments and
 

837
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,150
doing experiments and
um i wanted to go to like the coolest

838
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:32,160
um i wanted to go to like the coolest
 

839
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,470
um i wanted to go to like the coolest
lab the iss

840
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:34,480
lab the iss
 

841
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,110
lab the iss
and do some experiments there uh that's

842
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:37,120
and do some experiments there uh that's
 

843
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,509
and do some experiments there uh that's
being decommissioned which is sad

844
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:39,519
being decommissioned which is sad
 

845
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,749
being decommissioned which is sad
but you know there will be others i'm

846
00:15:41,749 --> 00:15:41,759
but you know there will be others i'm
 

847
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,189
but you know there will be others i'm
sure um

848
00:15:43,189 --> 00:15:43,199
sure um
 

849
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,189
sure um
the iss is being decommissioned yes i

850
00:15:45,189 --> 00:15:45,199
the iss is being decommissioned yes i
 

851
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:46,790
the iss is being decommissioned yes i
think by 2025

852
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:46,800
think by 2025
 

853
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,350
think by 2025
it's not going to be in use anymore but

854
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:49,360
it's not going to be in use anymore but
 

855
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:49,829
it's not going to be in use anymore but
i think

856
00:15:49,829 --> 00:15:49,839
i think
 

857
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,430
i think
um there are other there are private

858
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:51,440
um there are other there are private
 

859
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,110
um there are other there are private
companies that are going to be putting

860
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:53,120
companies that are going to be putting
 

861
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,069
companies that are going to be putting
up

862
00:15:54,069 --> 00:15:54,079
up
 

863
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,749
up
stations and things so it's primarily

864
00:15:55,749 --> 00:15:55,759
stations and things so it's primarily
 

865
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,670
stations and things so it's primarily
like a research lab essentially yes

866
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:57,680
like a research lab essentially yes
 

867
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,350
like a research lab essentially yes
research lab in space that's a cool way

868
00:15:59,350 --> 00:15:59,360
research lab in space that's a cool way
 

869
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,110
research lab in space that's a cool way
to say it's like the coolest possible

870
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:01,120
to say it's like the coolest possible
 

871
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,230
to say it's like the coolest possible
research lobby

872
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:02,240
research lobby
 

873
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,030
research lobby
that's where i wanted to go and now

874
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:05,040
that's where i wanted to go and now
 

875
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:05,509
that's where i wanted to go and now
though

876
00:16:05,509 --> 00:16:05,519
though
 

877
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,550
though
my you know risk profile has changed a

878
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:08,560
my you know risk profile has changed a
 

879
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,350
my you know risk profile has changed a
little bit i've

880
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:09,360
little bit i've
 

881
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:14,150
little bit i've
three little ones and um i won't

882
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:14,160
three little ones and um i won't
 

883
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,470
three little ones and um i won't
i won't be in the first thousand people

884
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:16,480
i won't be in the first thousand people
 

885
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,470
i won't be in the first thousand people
to go to mars let's put it that way

886
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:18,480
to go to mars let's put it that way
 

887
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,790
to go to mars let's put it that way
yeah earth is kind of nice we have our

888
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:20,800
yeah earth is kind of nice we have our
 

889
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,069
yeah earth is kind of nice we have our
troubles but overall

890
00:16:22,069 --> 00:16:22,079
troubles but overall
 

891
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:25,829
troubles but overall
it's pretty nice again it's the netflix

892
00:16:25,829 --> 00:16:25,839
it's pretty nice again it's the netflix
 

893
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,949
it's pretty nice again it's the netflix
okay let's talk rockets uh how does a

894
00:16:28,949 --> 00:16:28,959
okay let's talk rockets uh how does a
 

895
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,310
okay let's talk rockets uh how does a
rocket engine work

896
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:30,320
rocket engine work
 

897
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,430
rocket engine work
or any kind of engine that can

898
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:33,440
or any kind of engine that can
 

899
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,829
or any kind of engine that can
get us the space or float around in

900
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:35,839
get us the space or float around in
 

901
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,710
get us the space or float around in
space

902
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:36,720
space
 

903
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,670
space
the basic principle is conservation of

904
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:39,680
the basic principle is conservation of
 

905
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,389
the basic principle is conservation of
momentum

906
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:40,399
momentum
 

907
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,829
momentum
so um you throw stuff

908
00:16:43,829 --> 00:16:43,839
so um you throw stuff
 

909
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,430
so um you throw stuff
out the back of the engine and

910
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:47,440
out the back of the engine and
 

911
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,350
out the back of the engine and
and that pushes the rocket and the

912
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:49,360
and that pushes the rocket and the
 

913
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,949
and that pushes the rocket and the
spacecraft in the other direction

914
00:16:50,949 --> 00:16:50,959
spacecraft in the other direction
 

915
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:55,030
spacecraft in the other direction
so there are two main types of

916
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:55,040
so there are two main types of
 

917
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,790
so there are two main types of
of rocket propulsion the one

918
00:16:58,790 --> 00:16:58,800
of rocket propulsion the one
 

919
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,069
of rocket propulsion the one
people are more familiar with is

920
00:17:00,069 --> 00:17:00,079
people are more familiar with is
 

921
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,829
people are more familiar with is
chemical because it's loud and there's

922
00:17:02,829 --> 00:17:02,839
chemical because it's loud and there's
 

923
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:04,390
chemical because it's loud and there's
fire

924
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:04,400
fire
 

925
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,870
fire
and that's what's used for launch and is

926
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:06,880
and that's what's used for launch and is
 

927
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,949
and that's what's used for launch and is
more televised so

928
00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:08,959
more televised so
 

929
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,029
more televised so
um in in those types of systems you

930
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:11,039
um in in those types of systems you
 

931
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,230
um in in those types of systems you
usually have a

932
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:12,240
usually have a
 

933
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,270
usually have a
fuel on an oxidizer and they react and

934
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:15,280
fuel on an oxidizer and they react and
 

935
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,590
fuel on an oxidizer and they react and
combust and release stored chemical

936
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:17,600
combust and release stored chemical
 

937
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,549
combust and release stored chemical
energy

938
00:17:18,549 --> 00:17:18,559
energy
 

939
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,990
energy
um and and that energy heats um

940
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:22,000
um and and that energy heats um
 

941
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,309
um and and that energy heats um
heats the resultant gas and and that's

942
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:24,319
heats the resultant gas and and that's
 

943
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,630
heats the resultant gas and and that's
funneled out the back through a nozzle

944
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:26,640
funneled out the back through a nozzle
 

945
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,549
funneled out the back through a nozzle
directed out the back and and then that

946
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:28,559
directed out the back and and then that
 

947
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,630
directed out the back and and then that
momentum exchange

948
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:30,640
momentum exchange
 

949
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,470
momentum exchange
pushes the spacecraft forward is there

950
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:32,480
pushes the spacecraft forward is there
 

951
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,909
pushes the spacecraft forward is there
an interesting difference between liquid

952
00:17:33,909 --> 00:17:33,919
an interesting difference between liquid
 

953
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:34,950
an interesting difference between liquid
and solid

954
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:34,960
and solid
 

955
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,029
and solid
fuel in those contexts they're both

956
00:17:37,029 --> 00:17:37,039
fuel in those contexts they're both
 

957
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,630
fuel in those contexts they're both
lumped in the same

958
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:38,640
lumped in the same
 

959
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,830
lumped in the same
so uh chemical just means that the

960
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:41,840
so uh chemical just means that the
 

961
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,990
so uh chemical just means that the
release of energy from

962
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:44,000
release of energy from
 

963
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,710
release of energy from
from those bonds essentially so a solid

964
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:46,720
from those bonds essentially so a solid
 

965
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,830
from those bonds essentially so a solid
fuel works the same way

966
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:49,840
fuel works the same way
 

967
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,070
fuel works the same way
and the other main category is electric

968
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:52,080
and the other main category is electric
 

969
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,510
and the other main category is electric
propulsion so instead of

970
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:53,520
propulsion so instead of
 

971
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,430
propulsion so instead of
chemical energy you're using electrical

972
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:55,440
chemical energy you're using electrical
 

973
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,710
chemical energy you're using electrical
energy

974
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:56,720
energy
 

975
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,510
energy
usually from you know batteries or solar

976
00:17:59,510 --> 00:17:59,520
usually from you know batteries or solar
 

977
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,630
usually from you know batteries or solar
panels

978
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:00,640
panels
 

979
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,470
panels
and uh in this case the stuff you're

980
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:04,480
and uh in this case the stuff you're
 

981
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,830
and uh in this case the stuff you're
pushing out the back

982
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:05,840
pushing out the back
 

983
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,270
pushing out the back
would be charged particles so um

984
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:09,280
would be charged particles so um
 

985
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,310
would be charged particles so um
instead of combustion and heat you you

986
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:12,320
instead of combustion and heat you you
 

987
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,150
instead of combustion and heat you you
end up with charged particles and you

988
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:14,160
end up with charged particles and you
 

989
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,510
end up with charged particles and you
force them out the back of the

990
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:15,520
force them out the back of the
 

991
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,870
force them out the back of the
spacecraft using

992
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:16,880
spacecraft using
 

993
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,789
spacecraft using
either an electrostatic field or

994
00:18:18,789 --> 00:18:18,799
either an electrostatic field or
 

995
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,310
either an electrostatic field or
electromagnetic

996
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:20,320
electromagnetic
 

997
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,870
electromagnetic
um and but it's the same momentum

998
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:22,880
um and but it's the same momentum
 

999
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,950
um and but it's the same momentum
exchange and same idea stuff out the

1000
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:24,960
exchange and same idea stuff out the
 

1001
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,350
exchange and same idea stuff out the

00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:25,360
back
 

1003
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,990
back
and everything else goes forward cool so

1004
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:28,000
and everything else goes forward cool so
 

1005
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,029
and everything else goes forward cool so
those are the big two

1006
00:18:29,029 --> 00:18:29,039
those are the big two
 

1007
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:33,350
those are the big two
categories what what's the

1008
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:33,360
categories what what's the
 

1009
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,510
categories what what's the
difference maybe in like

1010
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:37,520
difference maybe in like
 

1011
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,150
difference maybe in like
the challenges of each the use cases of

1012
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:40,160
the challenges of each the use cases of
 

1013
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,430
the challenges of each the use cases of
each

1014
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:41,440
each
 

1015
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,230
each
and how they're used today the physics

1016
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:44,240
and how they're used today the physics
 

1017
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,750
and how they're used today the physics
of each

1018
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:45,760
of each
 

1019
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,669
of each
and where they're used all that kind of

1020
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:47,679
and where they're used all that kind of
 

1021
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,270
and where they're used all that kind of
stuff anything interesting about the two

1022
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:49,280
stuff anything interesting about the two
 

1023
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,350
stuff anything interesting about the two
categories that distinguishes them

1024
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:51,360
categories that distinguishes them
 

1025
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,789
categories that distinguishes them
besides the the chemical one being

1026
00:18:54,789 --> 00:18:54,799
besides the the chemical one being
 

1027
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,789
besides the the chemical one being
the big sexy flames and yeah fire fire

1028
00:18:58,789 --> 00:18:58,799
the big sexy flames and yeah fire fire
 

1029
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:02,150
the big sexy flames and yeah fire fire
yeah chemical is very well understood

1030
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:02,160
yeah chemical is very well understood
 

1031
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,830
yeah chemical is very well understood
um you know uh in its simplest form it's

1032
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:05,840
um you know uh in its simplest form it's
 

1033
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,870
um you know uh in its simplest form it's
like a firework

1034
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:06,880
like a firework
 

1035
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,990
like a firework
so it's been around since 400 bc

1036
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:10,000
so it's been around since 400 bc
 

1037
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,029
so it's been around since 400 bc
or something like that um so that even

1038
00:19:13,029 --> 00:19:13,039
or something like that um so that even
 

1039
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,310
or something like that um so that even
the big engines are quite well

1040
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:14,320
the big engines are quite well
 

1041
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,430
the big engines are quite well
understood i think

1042
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:15,440
understood i think
 

1043
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,549
understood i think
you know one of the one of the

1044
00:19:18,549 --> 00:19:18,559
you know one of the one of the
 

1045
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:23,590
you know one of the one of the
last gaps there is probably um

1046
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:23,600
last gaps there is probably um
 

1047
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,590
last gaps there is probably um
what exactly are the products of

1048
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:25,600
what exactly are the products of
 

1049
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,630
what exactly are the products of
combustion

1050
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:26,640
combustion
 

1051
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,669
combustion
um our modeling abilities kind of fall

1052
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:29,679
um our modeling abilities kind of fall
 

1053
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:30,630
um our modeling abilities kind of fall
apart

1054
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:30,640
apart
 

1055
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,630
apart
there um because it's hot and gases are

1056
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:34,640
there um because it's hot and gases are
 

1057
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,510
there um because it's hot and gases are
moving

1058
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:35,520
moving
 

1059
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,029
moving
and you end up kind of

1060
00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:39,039
and you end up kind of
 

1061
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,390
and you end up kind of
you know having to venture into

1062
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:42,400
you know having to venture into
 

1063
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,909
you know having to venture into
um lots of different interdisciplinary

1064
00:19:45,909 --> 00:19:45,919
um lots of different interdisciplinary
 

1065
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,750
um lots of different interdisciplinary
fields of science to try to solve that

1066
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:47,760
fields of science to try to solve that
 

1067
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,669
fields of science to try to solve that
and that's quite complex but we have

1068
00:19:49,669 --> 00:19:49,679
and that's quite complex but we have
 

1069
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,270
and that's quite complex but we have
pretty good

1070
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:51,280
pretty good
 

1071
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,950
pretty good
models for some of the more like

1072
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:52,960
models for some of the more like
 

1073
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,549
models for some of the more like
emergent behaviors of that system

1074
00:19:54,549 --> 00:19:54,559
emergent behaviors of that system
 

1075
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,150
emergent behaviors of that system
anyways but that's i think one of the

1076
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:56,160
anyways but that's i think one of the
 

1077
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,630
anyways but that's i think one of the
last

1078
00:19:58,630 --> 00:19:58,640

 

1079
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,909

unsolved pieces um and really the

1080
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:01,919
unsolved pieces um and really the
 

1081
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,630
unsolved pieces um and really the
the kind of what people care about there

1082
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:04,640
the kind of what people care about there
 

1083
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,029
the kind of what people care about there
is

1084
00:20:05,029 --> 00:20:05,039
is
 

1085
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:08,310
is
is making it more fuel efficient so

1086
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:08,320
is making it more fuel efficient so
 

1087
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,310
is making it more fuel efficient so
the chemical stuff you can get a lot of

1088
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:12,320
the chemical stuff you can get a lot of
 

1089
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,230
the chemical stuff you can get a lot of
instantaneous thrust but it's not very

1090
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:14,240
instantaneous thrust but it's not very
 

1091
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,070
instantaneous thrust but it's not very
fuel efficient it's much more fuel

1092
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:16,080
fuel efficient it's much more fuel
 

1093
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,270
fuel efficient it's much more fuel
efficient to go with the

1094
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:17,280
efficient to go with the
 

1095
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,230
efficient to go with the
electric type of propulsion um so that's

1096
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:20,240
electric type of propulsion um so that's
 

1097
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,710
electric type of propulsion um so that's
where people spend a lot of their time

1098
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:22,720
where people spend a lot of their time
 

1099
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,710
where people spend a lot of their time
um is trying to make that more efficient

1100
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:24,720
um is trying to make that more efficient
 

1101
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,230
um is trying to make that more efficient
in terms of thrust per

1102
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:26,240
in terms of thrust per
 

1103
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,430
in terms of thrust per
unit of fuel and then

1104
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:29,440
unit of fuel and then
 

1105
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,310
unit of fuel and then
um there's always considerations like

1106
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:32,320
um there's always considerations like
 

1107
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,070
um there's always considerations like
heating and cooling it's very

1108
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:34,080
heating and cooling it's very
 

1109
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,149
heating and cooling it's very
hot which is good if it heats the gases

1110
00:20:36,149 --> 00:20:36,159
hot which is good if it heats the gases
 

1111
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,710
hot which is good if it heats the gases
but you know bad if it melts the

1112
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:38,720
but you know bad if it melts the
 

1113
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,549
but you know bad if it melts the
rocket and and things like that so

1114
00:20:40,549 --> 00:20:40,559
rocket and and things like that so
 

1115
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:41,909
rocket and and things like that so
there's always a lot of work on heating

1116
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:41,919
there's always a lot of work on heating
 

1117
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:42,549
there's always a lot of work on heating
and cooling

1118
00:20:42,549 --> 00:20:42,559
and cooling
 

1119
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,789
and cooling
and the engine cycles and things like

1120
00:20:44,789 --> 00:20:44,799
and the engine cycles and things like
 

1121
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,390
and the engine cycles and things like
that

1122
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:46,400
that
 

1123
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,510
that
and then on electric propulsion i

1124
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:49,520
and then on electric propulsion i
 

1125
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,350
and then on electric propulsion i
find it like much more refreshingly

1126
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:53,360
find it like much more refreshingly
 

1127
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,110
find it like much more refreshingly
poorly understood uh lots more mysteries

1128
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:57,120
poorly understood uh lots more mysteries
 

1129
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,750
poorly understood uh lots more mysteries
yeah i think so one of the classes i

1130
00:20:59,750 --> 00:20:59,760
yeah i think so one of the classes i
 

1131
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,310
yeah i think so one of the classes i
took

1132
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:00,320
took
 

1133
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,909
took
in college spent we spent 90 percent of

1134
00:21:03,909 --> 00:21:03,919
in college spent we spent 90 percent of
 

1135
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:05,909
in college spent we spent 90 percent of
the class on chemical propulsion

1136
00:21:05,909 --> 00:21:05,919
the class on chemical propulsion
 

1137
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,990
the class on chemical propulsion
and then the last 10 on electric and the

1138
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:08,000
and then the last 10 on electric and the
 

1139
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,350
and then the last 10 on electric and the
professor said like

1140
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:09,360
professor said like
 

1141
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,070
professor said like
we only sort of understand how it works

1142
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:12,080
we only sort of understand how it works
 

1143
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:12,470
we only sort of understand how it works
but

1144
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:12,480
but
 

1145
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,270
but
it works kind of and it's like that's

1146
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:15,280
it works kind of and it's like that's
 

1147
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,789
it works kind of and it's like that's
that's interesting

1148
00:21:16,789 --> 00:21:16,799
that's interesting
 

1149
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,990
that's interesting
yeah and you know even uh an ion engine

1150
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:20,000
yeah and you know even uh an ion engine
 

1151
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,870
yeah and you know even uh an ion engine
which is

1152
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:20,880
which is
 

1153
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,630
which is
probably one of the most straightforward

1154
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:22,640
probably one of the most straightforward
 

1155
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,029
probably one of the most straightforward
because it's it has just an

1156
00:21:25,029 --> 00:21:25,039
because it's it has just an
 

1157
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:27,590
because it's it has just an
it's just an electrostatic engine but it

1158
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:27,600
it's just an electrostatic engine but it
 

1159
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,110
it's just an electrostatic engine but it
has this really awesome

1160
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:29,120
has this really awesome
 

1161
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,750
has this really awesome
combination of like quantum mechanics

1162
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:31,760
combination of like quantum mechanics
 

1163
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,710
combination of like quantum mechanics
and

1164
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:32,720
and
 

1165
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,990
and
material science and fluid dynamics and

1166
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:37,000
material science and fluid dynamics and
 

1167
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,310
material science and fluid dynamics and
electrostatics and and it's just very

1168
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:40,320
electrostatics and and it's just very
 

1169
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,190
electrostatics and and it's just very
intriguing to me um first of all can you

1170
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:43,200
intriguing to me um first of all can you
 

1171
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,630
intriguing to me um first of all can you
actually zoom out even more

1172
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:44,640
actually zoom out even more
 

1173
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,789
actually zoom out even more
like because you mentioned ion

1174
00:21:46,789 --> 00:21:46,799
like because you mentioned ion
 

1175
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:47,909
like because you mentioned ion
propulsion engine

1176
00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:47,919
propulsion engine
 

1177
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,270
propulsion engine
is a subset of electrolytes so like

1178
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:51,280
is a subset of electrolytes so like
 

1179
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,029
is a subset of electrolytes so like
maybe is there a categories of electric

1180
00:21:53,029 --> 00:21:53,039
maybe is there a categories of electric
 

1181
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,549
maybe is there a categories of electric
engines and then we can zoom in on

1182
00:21:54,549 --> 00:21:54,559
engines and then we can zoom in on
 

1183
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:57,669
engines and then we can zoom in on
ion propulsion yes so sure

1184
00:21:57,669 --> 00:21:57,679
ion propulsion yes so sure
 

1185
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:00,230
ion propulsion yes so sure
there's um the two most kind of

1186
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:00,240
there's um the two most kind of
 

1187
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,029
there's um the two most kind of
conventional

1188
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:01,039
conventional
 

1189
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,789
conventional
types that have been around since the

1190
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:02,799
types that have been around since the
 

1191
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:06,630
types that have been around since the
60s are ion engines and hall thrusters

1192
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:06,640
60s are ion engines and hall thrusters
 

1193
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,710
60s are ion engines and hall thrusters
and ion engines are a little bit simpler

1194
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:08,720
and ion engines are a little bit simpler
 

1195
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,310
and ion engines are a little bit simpler
because they don't use a

1196
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:10,320
because they don't use a
 

1197
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,070
because they don't use a
magnetic field for generating thrust

1198
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:14,080
magnetic field for generating thrust
 

1199
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,510
magnetic field for generating thrust
and then there are also

1200
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:17,520

 

1201
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,990

some other types of plasma engines but

1202
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:20,000
some other types of plasma engines but
 

1203
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,830
some other types of plasma engines but
that don't fit into those two categories

1204
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:21,840
that don't fit into those two categories
 

1205
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,149
that don't fit into those two categories
so

1206
00:22:22,149 --> 00:22:22,159
so
 

1207
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,710
so
just kind of other plasma like a

1208
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:24,720
just kind of other plasma like a
 

1209
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,510
just kind of other plasma like a
vasomere

1210
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:25,520
vasomere
 

1211
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,549
vasomere
engine which we could get into um

1212
00:22:28,549 --> 00:22:28,559
engine which we could get into um
 

1213
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:31,350
engine which we could get into um
and then those are probably the main

1214
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:31,360
and then those are probably the main
 

1215
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:31,830
and then those are probably the main
three

1216
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:31,840
three
 

1217
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,510
three
categories that would be fun to talk

1218
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:33,520
categories that would be fun to talk
 

1219
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,909
categories that would be fun to talk
about oh and then of course the category

1220
00:22:35,909 --> 00:22:35,919
about oh and then of course the category
 

1221
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,470
about oh and then of course the category
of engine that i work on which is has a

1222
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:38,480
of engine that i work on which is has a
 

1223
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,630
of engine that i work on which is has a
lot of similarities to an ion engine but

1224
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:40,640
lot of similarities to an ion engine but
 

1225
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,710
lot of similarities to an ion engine but
could be considered its own class called

1226
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:42,720
could be considered its own class called
 

1227
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,470
could be considered its own class called
a colloid thruster

1228
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:44,480
a colloid thruster
 

1229
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,190
a colloid thruster
colloid cool okay so what is an ion

1230
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:47,200
colloid cool okay so what is an ion
 

1231
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:47,990
colloid cool okay so what is an ion
propulsion

1232
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:48,000
propulsion
 

1233
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,270
propulsion
i imagine okay so in an ion engine you

1234
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:51,280
i imagine okay so in an ion engine you
 

1235
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:51,909
i imagine okay so in an ion engine you
have

1236
00:22:51,909 --> 00:22:51,919
have
 

1237
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:55,190
have
an ionization chamber and you

1238
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:55,200
an ionization chamber and you
 

1239
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,510
an ionization chamber and you
inject the propellant into that chamber

1240
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:57,520
inject the propellant into that chamber
 

1241
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,510
inject the propellant into that chamber
and this is usually

1242
00:22:59,510 --> 00:22:59,520
and this is usually
 

1243
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,430
and this is usually
a neutral gas like xenon or argon

1244
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:03,440
a neutral gas like xenon or argon
 

1245
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,029
a neutral gas like xenon or argon
so you inject that into the chamber and

1246
00:23:05,029 --> 00:23:05,039
so you inject that into the chamber and
 

1247
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:08,070
so you inject that into the chamber and
you also inject

1248
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:08,080
you also inject
 

1249
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,870
you also inject
a stream of really hot high-energy

1250
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:10,880
a stream of really hot high-energy
 

1251
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,230
a stream of really hot high-energy
electrons

1252
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:12,240
electrons
 

1253
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,350
electrons
and everything's just moving around

1254
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:15,360
and everything's just moving around
 

1255
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,070
and everything's just moving around
very randomly in there and the the whole

1256
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:18,080
very randomly in there and the the whole
 

1257
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,149
very randomly in there and the the whole
goal is to have

1258
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:20,159
goal is to have
 

1259
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:21,909
goal is to have
one of those electrons collide with one

1260
00:23:21,909 --> 00:23:21,919
one of those electrons collide with one
 

1261
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:24,070
one of those electrons collide with one
of those neutral atoms

1262
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:24,080
of those neutral atoms
 

1263
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,549
of those neutral atoms
and turn it into an ion so kick off a

1264
00:23:26,549 --> 00:23:26,559
and turn it into an ion so kick off a
 

1265
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,070
and turn it into an ion so kick off a
secondary electron

1266
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:28,080
secondary electron
 

1267
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,350
secondary electron
and now you have plasma yes okay

1268
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:31,360
and now you have plasma yes okay
 

1269
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,870
and now you have plasma yes okay
and now you have um

1270
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:34,880
and now you have um
 

1271
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,590
and now you have um
and now you have a charged you know

1272
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:37,600
and now you have a charged you know
 

1273
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,870
and now you have a charged you know
xenon or argon

1274
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:38,880
xenon or argon
 

1275
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,909
xenon or argon
ion and and more electrons and so on

1276
00:23:41,909 --> 00:23:41,919
ion and and more electrons and so on
 

1277
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,510
ion and and more electrons and so on
um and then uh some fraction of those

1278
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:45,520
um and then uh some fraction of those
 

1279
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,830
um and then uh some fraction of those
ions will happen to make it to this

1280
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:47,840
ions will happen to make it to this
 

1281
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,590
ions will happen to make it to this
downstream

1282
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:49,600
downstream
 

1283
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,750
downstream
electric field that we set up between

1284
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:51,760
electric field that we set up between
 

1285
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,830
electric field that we set up between
two grids with holes in them

1286
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:53,840
two grids with holes in them
 

1287
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,950
two grids with holes in them
and you know in terms of area the same

1288
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:56,960
and you know in terms of area the same
 

1289
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,510
and you know in terms of area the same
amount of those ions also makes runs

1290
00:23:59,510 --> 00:23:59,520
amount of those ions also makes runs
 

1291
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,390
amount of those ions also makes runs
into the walls and lose their charge and

1292
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:02,400
into the walls and lose their charge and
 

1293
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,990
into the walls and lose their charge and
that's where some of the inefficiencies

1294
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:04,000
that's where some of the inefficiencies
 

1295
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,149
that's where some of the inefficiencies
come in but the very lucky

1296
00:24:06,149 --> 00:24:06,159
come in but the very lucky
 

1297
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:08,470
come in but the very lucky
few make it to those holes and in that

1298
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:08,480
few make it to those holes and in that
 

1299
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,350
few make it to those holes and in that
grid and

1300
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:09,360
grid and
 

1301
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,990
grid and
they're two grids actually and you apply

1302
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:12,000
they're two grids actually and you apply
 

1303
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,110
they're two grids actually and you apply
a voltage

1304
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:13,120
a voltage
 

1305
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,029
a voltage
differential between them and and that

1306
00:24:15,029 --> 00:24:15,039
differential between them and and that
 

1307
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:16,950
differential between them and and that
sets up an electric field

1308
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:16,960
sets up an electric field
 

1309
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,029
sets up an electric field
and a charged particle in an electric

1310
00:24:19,029 --> 00:24:19,039
and a charged particle in an electric
 

1311
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:21,350
and a charged particle in an electric
field creates a force

1312
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:21,360
field creates a force
 

1313
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,669
field creates a force
and so those ions are accelerated out

1314
00:24:23,669 --> 00:24:23,679
and so those ions are accelerated out
 

1315
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:24,789
and so those ions are accelerated out
the back of the engine

1316
00:24:24,789 --> 00:24:24,799
the back of the engine
 

1317
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:28,390
the back of the engine
and the reaction force is is what pushes

1318
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:28,400
and the reaction force is is what pushes
 

1319
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,110
and the reaction force is is what pushes
the spacecraft forward

1320
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:31,120
the spacecraft forward
 

1321
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,750
the spacecraft forward
if you're you know following along and

1322
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:33,760
if you're you know following along and
 

1323
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,789
if you're you know following along and
tallying these

1324
00:24:34,789 --> 00:24:34,799
tallying these
 

1325
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:38,630
tallying these
charges now we've just sent a positive

1326
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:38,640
charges now we've just sent a positive
 

1327
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,230
charges now we've just sent a positive
beam of ions out the back of the

1328
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:40,240
beam of ions out the back of the
 

1329
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,909
beam of ions out the back of the
spacecraft um

1330
00:24:41,909 --> 00:24:41,919
spacecraft um
 

1331
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:43,990
spacecraft um
and and for our purposes here the

1332
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:44,000
and and for our purposes here the
 

1333
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,510
and and for our purposes here the
spacecraft is neutral

1334
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:45,520
spacecraft is neutral
 

1335
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,870
spacecraft is neutral
so eventually those ions will come back

1336
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:48,880
so eventually those ions will come back
 

1337
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,710
so eventually those ions will come back
and hit the spacecraft because it's a

1338
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:50,720
and hit the spacecraft because it's a
 

1339
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,909
and hit the spacecraft because it's a
positive beam so

1340
00:24:51,909 --> 00:24:51,919
positive beam so
 

1341
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:54,310
positive beam so
you also have to have an external

1342
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:54,320
you also have to have an external
 

1343
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,590
you also have to have an external
cathode

1344
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:55,600
cathode
 

1345
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,710
cathode
producer of electrons outside the engine

1346
00:24:58,710 --> 00:24:58,720
producer of electrons outside the engine
 

1347
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,269
producer of electrons outside the engine
that pumps electrons into that beam and

1348
00:25:01,269 --> 00:25:01,279
that pumps electrons into that beam and
 

1349
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,510
that pumps electrons into that beam and
neutralizes that so now it's net neutral

1350
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:03,520
neutralizes that so now it's net neutral
 

1351
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,710
neutralizes that so now it's net neutral
everywhere and it won't come back to the

1352
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:04,720
everywhere and it won't come back to the
 

1353
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,830
everywhere and it won't come back to the
spacecraft so

1354
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:05,840
spacecraft so
 

1355
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,909
spacecraft so
that's that's an ion engine what

1356
00:25:07,909 --> 00:25:07,919
that's that's an ion engine what
 

1357
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:09,669
that's that's an ion engine what
temperature we're talking about here

1358
00:25:09,669 --> 00:25:09,679
temperature we're talking about here
 

1359
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:12,070
temperature we're talking about here
so in terms of like the the chemical

1360
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:12,080
so in terms of like the the chemical
 

1361
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:12,870
so in terms of like the the chemical
based engines

1362
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:12,880
based engines
 

1363
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,590
based engines
those are super hot uh you mentioned

1364
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:15,600
those are super hot uh you mentioned
 

1365
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,630
those are super hot uh you mentioned
plasma here

1366
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:16,640
plasma here
 

1367
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,990
plasma here
how hot does this thing get um

1368
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:20,000
how hot does this thing get um
 

1369
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,430
how hot does this thing get um
i mean is that an interesting thing to

1370
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:21,440
i mean is that an interesting thing to
 

1371
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,750
i mean is that an interesting thing to
talk about in a sense that is that a

1372
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:23,760
talk about in a sense that is that a
 

1373
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,470
talk about in a sense that is that a
interesting distinction or is the heat i

1374
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:26,480
interesting distinction or is the heat i
 

1375
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,230
interesting distinction or is the heat i
mean it's all going to be hot

1376
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:28,240
mean it's all going to be hot
 

1377
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,269
mean it's all going to be hot
no so it's important especially for some

1378
00:25:31,269 --> 00:25:31,279
no so it's important especially for some
 

1379
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,430
no so it's important especially for some
of these smaller satellites people are

1380
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:33,440
of these smaller satellites people are
 

1381
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,029
of these smaller satellites people are
into launching these days so the

1382
00:25:37,029 --> 00:25:37,039
into launching these days so the
 

1383
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,549
into launching these days so the
it's important because you have the

1384
00:25:38,549 --> 00:25:38,559
it's important because you have the
 

1385
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:40,870
it's important because you have the
plasma but also those high energy

1386
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:40,880
plasma but also those high energy
 

1387
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,630
plasma but also those high energy
electrons are hot and if you have

1388
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:44,640
electrons are hot and if you have
 

1389
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,149
electrons are hot and if you have
a lot of those that are going into the

1390
00:25:46,149 --> 00:25:46,159
a lot of those that are going into the
 

1391
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:47,510
a lot of those that are going into the
walls you do have to care about the

1392
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:47,520
walls you do have to care about the
 

1393
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,710
walls you do have to care about the
temperature so

1394
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:48,720
temperature so
 

1395
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,830
temperature so
um i am having trouble remembering off

1396
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:51,840
um i am having trouble remembering off
 

1397
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,190
um i am having trouble remembering off
the top of my head i think they're at

1398
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:53,200
the top of my head i think they're at
 

1399
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,590
the top of my head i think they're at
like 100 electron volts in terms of the

1400
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:55,600
like 100 electron volts in terms of the
 

1401
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,310
like 100 electron volts in terms of the
electron energy and then i'd have to

1402
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:58,320
electron energy and then i'd have to
 

1403
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,549
electron energy and then i'd have to
remember how to convert that into kelvin

1404
00:26:00,549 --> 00:26:00,559
remember how to convert that into kelvin
 

1405
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,070
remember how to convert that into kelvin
can you stick your hand in it

1406
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:02,080
can you stick your hand in it
 

1407
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,750
can you stick your hand in it
is that no no temperature not

1408
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:03,760
is that no no temperature not
 

1409
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,510
is that no no temperature not
recommended yeah okay

1410
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:05,520
recommended yeah okay
 

1411
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,750
recommended yeah okay
so what's a colloid engine so the same

1412
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:09,760
so what's a colloid engine so the same
 

1413
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,870
so what's a colloid engine so the same
rocket people that um

1414
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:12,880
rocket people that um
 

1415
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,149
rocket people that um
came up with with these ideas for

1416
00:26:16,149 --> 00:26:16,159
came up with with these ideas for
 

1417
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:17,510
came up with with these ideas for
electric propulsion

1418
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:17,520
electric propulsion
 

1419
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,549
electric propulsion
um probably in the middle of of last

1420
00:26:20,549 --> 00:26:20,559
um probably in the middle of of last
 

1421
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:23,669
um probably in the middle of of last
century also realized that

1422
00:26:23,669 --> 00:26:23,679
century also realized that
 

1423
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:26,390
century also realized that
there's one more place to get charged

1424
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:26,400
there's one more place to get charged
 

1425
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,669
there's one more place to get charged
particles from

1426
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:27,679
particles from
 

1427
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:29,669
particles from
um if you're going to be using electric

1428
00:26:29,669 --> 00:26:29,679
um if you're going to be using electric
 

1429
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:31,990
um if you're going to be using electric
propulsion so you can take a gas and you

1430
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:32,000
propulsion so you can take a gas and you
 

1431
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,110
propulsion so you can take a gas and you
can ionize it

1432
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:33,120
can ionize it
 

1433
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,669
can ionize it
but there are also some liquids

1434
00:26:35,669 --> 00:26:35,679
but there are also some liquids
 

1435
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:36,470
but there are also some liquids
particularly

1436
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:36,480
particularly
 

1437
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,029
particularly
ionic liquids which is what we use that

1438
00:26:39,029 --> 00:26:39,039
ionic liquids which is what we use that
 

1439
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,630
ionic liquids which is what we use that
you also can

1440
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:40,640
you also can
 

1441
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,110
you also can
use as a source of ions and if you have

1442
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:43,120
use as a source of ions and if you have
 

1443
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,710
use as a source of ions and if you have
ions and you put them in a field you

1444
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:44,720
ions and you put them in a field you
 

1445
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,390
ions and you put them in a field you
generate a force so

1446
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:46,400
generate a force so
 

1447
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,070
generate a force so
they recognize that but

1448
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:50,080
they recognize that but
 

1449
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,909
they recognize that but
part of being able to leverage that

1450
00:26:51,909 --> 00:26:51,919
part of being able to leverage that
 

1451
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:54,630
part of being able to leverage that
technique is being able to

1452
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:54,640
technique is being able to
 

1453
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,789
technique is being able to
kind of manipulate those liquids on a

1454
00:26:56,789 --> 00:26:56,799
kind of manipulate those liquids on a
 

1455
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,710
kind of manipulate those liquids on a
scale of nanometers

1456
00:26:58,710 --> 00:26:58,720
scale of nanometers
 

1457
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,830
scale of nanometers
or or you know very few microns so you

1458
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:01,840
or or you know very few microns so you
 

1459
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,789
or or you know very few microns so you
know the

1460
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:02,799
know the
 

1461
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,789
know the
diameter of a human hair or something

1462
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:04,799
diameter of a human hair or something
 

1463
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,789
diameter of a human hair or something
like that and in the 50s

1464
00:27:06,789 --> 00:27:06,799
like that and in the 50s
 

1465
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,950
like that and in the 50s
there was no way to do that so they

1466
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:08,960
there was no way to do that so they
 

1467
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,870
there was no way to do that so they
wrote about it in some books and then

1468
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:10,880
wrote about it in some books and then
 

1469
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,950
wrote about it in some books and then
it kind of died for a little bit and

1470
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:12,960
it kind of died for a little bit and
 

1471
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,149
it kind of died for a little bit and
then

1472
00:27:14,149 --> 00:27:14,159
then
 

1473
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:17,830
then
with um silicon mems computer processors

1474
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:17,840
with um silicon mems computer processors
 

1475
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,149
with um silicon mems computer processors
and

1476
00:27:18,149 --> 00:27:18,159
and
 

1477
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,230
and
and when foundry started becoming more

1478
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:20,240
and when foundry started becoming more
 

1479
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,350
and when foundry started becoming more
ubiquitous

1480
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:21,360
ubiquitous
 

1481
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,549
ubiquitous
and my advisor started at

1482
00:27:24,549 --> 00:27:24,559
and my advisor started at
 

1483
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:27,590
and my advisor started at
mit uh kind of put those

1484
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:27,600
mit uh kind of put those
 

1485
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,149
mit uh kind of put those
ideas back together and was like hey

1486
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:30,159
ideas back together and was like hey
 

1487
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:32,630
ideas back together and was like hey
actually there's now a way to build this

1488
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:32,640
actually there's now a way to build this
 

1489
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,430
actually there's now a way to build this
and bring this other technique to life

1490
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:35,440
and bring this other technique to life
 

1491
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,070
and bring this other technique to life
um

1492
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:36,080
um
 

1493
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,269
um
and so the way that the way that you

1494
00:27:39,269 --> 00:27:39,279
and so the way that the way that you
 

1495
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:40,149
and so the way that the way that you
actually get the

1496
00:27:40,149 --> 00:27:40,159
actually get the
 

1497
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:43,029
actually get the
the ions out of those liquids um is you

1498
00:27:43,029 --> 00:27:43,039
the ions out of those liquids um is you
 

1499
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:43,909
the ions out of those liquids um is you
put the liquid

1500
00:27:43,909 --> 00:27:43,919
put the liquid
 

1501
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:47,190
put the liquid
in a in again a strong electric field

1502
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:47,200
in a in again a strong electric field
 

1503
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,350
in a in again a strong electric field
and the electric field stresses the

1504
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:49,360
and the electric field stresses the
 

1505
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,669
and the electric field stresses the
liquid and you keep increasing the field

1506
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:51,679
liquid and you keep increasing the field
 

1507
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:53,750
liquid and you keep increasing the field
and eventually the liquid will assume

1508
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:53,760
and eventually the liquid will assume
 

1509
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,950
and eventually the liquid will assume
uh this way a conical shape um

1510
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:56,960
uh this way a conical shape um
 

1511
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,750
uh this way a conical shape um
it's the it's when the electric field

1512
00:27:59,750 --> 00:27:59,760
it's the it's when the electric field
 

1513
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,830
it's the it's when the electric field
pressure that's pulling on it exactly

1514
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:01,840
pressure that's pulling on it exactly
 

1515
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,630
pressure that's pulling on it exactly
balances

1516
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:02,640
balances
 

1517
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,789
balances
the liquid's own restoring force which

1518
00:28:04,789 --> 00:28:04,799
the liquid's own restoring force which
 

1519
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,789
the liquid's own restoring force which
is its surface tension

1520
00:28:06,789 --> 00:28:06,799
is its surface tension
 

1521
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,549
is its surface tension
so you have this balance and the liquid

1522
00:28:08,549 --> 00:28:08,559
so you have this balance and the liquid
 

1523
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,310
so you have this balance and the liquid
assumes a cone

1524
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:10,320
assumes a cone
 

1525
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,310
assumes a cone
when it's perfectly balanced like that

1526
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:12,320
when it's perfectly balanced like that
 

1527
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,630
when it's perfectly balanced like that
and at the tip of a cone

1528
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:14,640
and at the tip of a cone
 

1529
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,950
and at the tip of a cone
the radius of curvature goes to zero

1530
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:16,960
the radius of curvature goes to zero
 

1531
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,070
the radius of curvature goes to zero
right at the tip

1532
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:18,080
right at the tip
 

1533
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,190
right at the tip
um and uh the radius

1534
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:21,200
um and uh the radius
 

1535
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,190
um and uh the radius
sorry the electric field um right at the

1536
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:23,200
sorry the electric field um right at the
 

1537
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,070
sorry the electric field um right at the
tip of a sharp object would go to

1538
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:26,080
tip of a sharp object would go to
 

1539
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,430
tip of a sharp object would go to
infinity uh because it goes

1540
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:29,440
infinity uh because it goes
 

1541
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,070
infinity uh because it goes
is one over the radius and one over the

1542
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:32,080
is one over the radius and one over the
 

1543
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,110
is one over the radius and one over the
radius squared

1544
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:33,120
radius squared
 

1545
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,070
radius squared
and instead of the electric field going

1546
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:36,080
and instead of the electric field going
 

1547
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:36,710
and instead of the electric field going
to

1548
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:36,720
to
 

1549
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,190
to
infinity and maybe like generating a

1550
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:39,200
infinity and maybe like generating a
 

1551
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,789
infinity and maybe like generating a
wormhole or something

1552
00:28:40,789 --> 00:28:40,799
wormhole or something
 

1553
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:43,669
wormhole or something
a jet of ions instead starts you know

1554
00:28:43,669 --> 00:28:43,679
a jet of ions instead starts you know
 

1555
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:45,269
a jet of ions instead starts you know
issuing from the tip of

1556
00:28:45,269 --> 00:28:45,279
issuing from the tip of
 

1557
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:46,870
issuing from the tip of
of that liquid so the field becomes

1558
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:46,880
of that liquid so the field becomes
 

1559
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,389
of that liquid so the field becomes
strong enough there that you can pull

1560
00:28:48,389 --> 00:28:48,399
strong enough there that you can pull
 

1561
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:49,110
strong enough there that you can pull
ions

1562
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:49,120
ions
 

1563
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,430
ions
um out of the liquid what is the liquid

1564
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:51,440
um out of the liquid what is the liquid
 

1565
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,149
um out of the liquid what is the liquid
we're talking about

1566
00:28:52,149 --> 00:28:52,159
we're talking about
 

1567
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:54,630
we're talking about
so there's a bunch of different ones you

1568
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:54,640
so there's a bunch of different ones you
 

1569
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,669
so there's a bunch of different ones you
can do it with

1570
00:28:55,669 --> 00:28:55,679
can do it with
 

1571
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:58,470
can do it with
um with different types of liquids it

1572
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:58,480
um with different types of liquids it
 

1573
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,549
um with different types of liquids it
depends on you know how easily you can

1574
00:29:00,549 --> 00:29:00,559
depends on you know how easily you can
 

1575
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:01,269
depends on you know how easily you can
free

1576
00:29:01,269 --> 00:29:01,279
free
 

1577
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:04,630
free
ions from their neighbors and if it has

1578
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:04,640
ions from their neighbors and if it has
 

1579
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,389
ions from their neighbors and if it has
enough surface tension

1580
00:29:06,389 --> 00:29:06,399
enough surface tension
 

1581
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:07,909
enough surface tension
so that you can build up a high enough

1582
00:29:07,909 --> 00:29:07,919
so that you can build up a high enough
 

1583
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:09,510
so that you can build up a high enough
electric field but

1584
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:09,520
electric field but
 

1585
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,389
electric field but
what we use are called ionic liquids and

1586
00:29:12,389 --> 00:29:12,399
what we use are called ionic liquids and
 

1587
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:13,830
what we use are called ionic liquids and
they're really just positive

1588
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:13,840
they're really just positive
 

1589
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,830
they're really just positive
they're they're very similar to salts

1590
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:15,840
they're they're very similar to salts
 

1591
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,350
they're they're very similar to salts
but they happen to be liquid over a

1592
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:17,360
but they happen to be liquid over a
 

1593
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,269
but they happen to be liquid over a
really wide range of temperatures

1594
00:29:19,269 --> 00:29:19,279
really wide range of temperatures
 

1595
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:22,149
really wide range of temperatures
this sounds like really cool okay so how

1596
00:29:22,149 --> 00:29:22,159
this sounds like really cool okay so how
 

1597
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:22,789
this sounds like really cool okay so how
big is the

1598
00:29:22,789 --> 00:29:22,799
big is the
 

1599
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:25,029
big is the
uh how big is the kona we talk what

1600
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:25,039
uh how big is the kona we talk what
 

1601
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:25,990
uh how big is the kona we talk what
what's the size of

1602
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:26,000
what's the size of
 

1603
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,750
what's the size of
this cone that generates that if you

1604
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:27,760
this cone that generates that if you
 

1605
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,310
this cone that generates that if you
have a cone that's emitting pure ions

1606
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:30,320
have a cone that's emitting pure ions
 

1607
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,909
have a cone that's emitting pure ions
um the i can't remember if it's the

1608
00:29:33,909 --> 00:29:33,919
um the i can't remember if it's the
 

1609
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:35,430
um the i can't remember if it's the
radius or diameter but

1610
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:35,440
radius or diameter but
 

1611
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,029
radius or diameter but
um that emission is happening from

1612
00:29:39,029 --> 00:29:39,039
um that emission is happening from
 

1613
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:40,549
um that emission is happening from
of that cone is something like 20

1614
00:29:40,549 --> 00:29:40,559
of that cone is something like 20
 

1615
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:43,510
of that cone is something like 20
nanometers oh

1616
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:43,520
nanometers oh
 

1617
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,870
nanometers oh
i was imagining something slightly

1618
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:44,880
i was imagining something slightly
 

1619
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,630
i was imagining something slightly
bigger but so like this is

1620
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:46,640
bigger but so like this is
 

1621
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,149
bigger but so like this is
so this is tiny tiny yes hence the

1622
00:29:50,149 --> 00:29:50,159
so this is tiny tiny yes hence the
 

1623
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:52,230
so this is tiny tiny yes hence the
only being able to do it recently yeah

1624
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:52,240
only being able to do it recently yeah
 

1625
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,830
only being able to do it recently yeah
that's right so this is all controlled

1626
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:53,840
that's right so this is all controlled
 

1627
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,590
that's right so this is all controlled
by a computer i guess

1628
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:55,600
by a computer i guess
 

1629
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,190
by a computer i guess
like or like how do you control

1630
00:29:59,190 --> 00:29:59,200
like or like how do you control
 

1631
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,950
like or like how do you control
how do you create a cone that generates

1632
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:00,960
how do you create a cone that generates
 

1633
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,190
how do you create a cone that generates
ions on a scale of nanometers

1634
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:03,200
ions on a scale of nanometers
 

1635
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,789
ions on a scale of nanometers
exactly so the kind of main

1636
00:30:06,789 --> 00:30:06,799
exactly so the kind of main
 

1637
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:09,750
exactly so the kind of main
trick to making this work is that

1638
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:09,760
trick to making this work is that
 

1639
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,070
trick to making this work is that
physically we manufacture

1640
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:12,080
physically we manufacture
 

1641
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,750
physically we manufacture
hundreds or thousands of sharp

1642
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:13,760
hundreds or thousands of sharp
 

1643
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,389
hundreds or thousands of sharp
structures and then supply the liquid to

1644
00:30:16,389 --> 00:30:16,399
structures and then supply the liquid to
 

1645
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:17,830
structures and then supply the liquid to
the tips so

1646
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:17,840
the tips so
 

1647
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,789
the tips so
that does a few things it makes sure

1648
00:30:20,789 --> 00:30:20,799
that does a few things it makes sure
 

1649
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:22,470
that does a few things it makes sure
that we know where the ion beams are

1650
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:22,480
that we know where the ion beams are
 

1651
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,630
that we know where the ion beams are
forming so we can put holes in the grid

1652
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:24,640
forming so we can put holes in the grid
 

1653
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,310
forming so we can put holes in the grid
above them to let them actually leave

1654
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:26,320
above them to let them actually leave
 

1655
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,590
above them to let them actually leave
instead of hitting

1656
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:27,600
instead of hitting
 

1657
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,870
instead of hitting
right cool um but it also reduces

1658
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:30,880
right cool um but it also reduces
 

1659
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,430
right cool um but it also reduces
the actual field we have to the voltage

1660
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:33,440
the actual field we have to the voltage
 

1661
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,110
the actual field we have to the voltage
we have to apply to create that field

1662
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:35,120
we have to apply to create that field
 

1663
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,630
we have to apply to create that field
because the field will be much stronger

1664
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:36,640
because the field will be much stronger
 

1665
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,190
because the field will be much stronger
if we can

1666
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:37,200
if we can
 

1667
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,789
if we can
already give the liquid a tip to form

1668
00:30:40,789 --> 00:30:40,799
already give the liquid a tip to form
 

1669
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:44,230
already give the liquid a tip to form
on and those tips we form have radii of

1670
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:44,240
on and those tips we form have radii of
 

1671
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,230
on and those tips we form have radii of
curvature

1672
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:46,240
curvature
 

1673
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,750
curvature
on the order of probably like single

1674
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:49,760
on the order of probably like single
 

1675
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,230
on the order of probably like single
microns so we are working at a little

1676
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:52,240
microns so we are working at a little
 

1677
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,389
microns so we are working at a little
bit larger scale but once we

1678
00:30:54,389 --> 00:30:54,399
bit larger scale but once we
 

1679
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,230
bit larger scale but once we
create that support and the electric

1680
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:56,240
create that support and the electric
 

1681
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,830
create that support and the electric
field can be focused at that tip

1682
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:57,840
field can be focused at that tip
 

1683
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,149
field can be focused at that tip
then the tiny little cone can form so

1684
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:00,159
then the tiny little cone can form so
 

1685
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:01,830
then the tiny little cone can form so
wait so there's something in them

1686
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:01,840
wait so there's something in them
 

1687
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,549
wait so there's something in them
there's an already like a hard material

1688
00:31:04,549 --> 00:31:04,559
there's an already like a hard material
 

1689
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:05,190
there's an already like a hard material
that like

1690
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:05,200
that like
 

1691
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,110
that like
gives you the base for the cone and

1692
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:07,120
gives you the base for the cone and
 

1693
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,470
gives you the base for the cone and
you're pouring like liquid over it

1694
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:08,480
you're pouring like liquid over it
 

1695
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,590
you're pouring like liquid over it
whatever from the bottom

1696
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:09,600
whatever from the bottom
 

1697
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,830
whatever from the bottom
yeah it's porous so we actually supply

1698
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:11,840
yeah it's porous so we actually supply
 

1699
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,110
yeah it's porous so we actually supply
it from the back of the chip

1700
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:13,120
it from the back of the chip
 

1701
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,430
it from the back of the chip
and then liquid forms on top yeah on

1702
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:15,440
and then liquid forms on top yeah on
 

1703
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,870
and then liquid forms on top yeah on
that structure yeah

1704
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:16,880
that structure yeah
 

1705
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,710
that structure yeah
and then you somehow make it like super

1706
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:18,720
and then you somehow make it like super
 

1707
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,389
and then you somehow make it like super
sharp the liquid

1708
00:31:20,389 --> 00:31:20,399
sharp the liquid
 

1709
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:24,789
sharp the liquid
so the ions can leave

1710
00:31:24,789 --> 00:31:24,799

 

1711
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:27,590

and then we've applied that field to get

1712
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:27,600
and then we've applied that field to get
 

1713
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,830
and then we've applied that field to get
those ions and that same field then

1714
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:29,840
those ions and that same field then
 

1715
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,310
those ions and that same field then
accelerates them that's awesome and

1716
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:32,320
accelerates them that's awesome and
 

1717
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,830
accelerates them that's awesome and
there's like a bunch of these

1718
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:33,840
there's like a bunch of these
 

1719
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,549
there's like a bunch of these
yeah i should have i should have brought

1720
00:31:36,549 --> 00:31:36,559
yeah i should have i should have brought
 

1721
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:38,230
yeah i should have i should have brought
something um so

1722
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:38,240
something um so
 

1723
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,830
something um so
well you could just pretend that you

1724
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:39,840
well you could just pretend that you
 

1725
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,509
well you could just pretend that you
have some nanometer cones on

1726
00:31:41,509 --> 00:31:41,519
have some nanometer cones on
 

1727
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:43,830
have some nanometer cones on
so actually you know kind of about this

1728
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:43,840
so actually you know kind of about this
 

1729
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,870
so actually you know kind of about this
scale um

1730
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:44,880
scale um
 

1731
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,990
scale um
we build we call them thruster chips and

1732
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:48,000
we build we call them thruster chips and
 

1733
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,909
we build we call them thruster chips and
it's just a convenient form factor and

1734
00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:49,919
it's just a convenient form factor and
 

1735
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:51,669
it's just a convenient form factor and
it's a square centimeter

1736
00:31:51,669 --> 00:31:51,679
it's a square centimeter
 

1737
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:53,750
it's a square centimeter
and on each square centimeter today we

1738
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:53,760
and on each square centimeter today we
 

1739
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,470
and on each square centimeter today we
have about 500 of the actual physical

1740
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:56,480
have about 500 of the actual physical
 

1741
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,830
have about 500 of the actual physical
we call them emitters those physical

1742
00:31:58,830 --> 00:31:58,840
we call them emitters those physical
 

1743
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,389
we call them emitters those physical
cones um

1744
00:32:00,389 --> 00:32:00,399
cones um
 

1745
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:03,269
cones um
and we're working on increasing that by

1746
00:32:03,269 --> 00:32:03,279
and we're working on increasing that by
 

1747
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:04,310
and we're working on increasing that by
a factor of four

1748
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:04,320
a factor of four
 

1749
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,430
a factor of four
in the coming months in size or in in

1750
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:07,440
in the coming months in size or in in
 

1751
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:07,990
in the coming months in size or in in
number

1752
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:08,000
number
 

1753
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,230
number
and the density the number of emitters

1754
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:10,240
and the density the number of emitters
 

1755
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,230
and the density the number of emitters
within the same square centimeter chip

1756
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:12,240
within the same square centimeter chip
 

1757
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,590
within the same square centimeter chip
so that thing because i think i've seen

1758
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:13,600
so that thing because i think i've seen
 

1759
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,350
so that thing because i think i've seen
pictures of you with like a tiny thing

1760
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:15,360
pictures of you with like a tiny thing
 

1761
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,990
pictures of you with like a tiny thing
yeah and that must be the thing okay so

1762
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:18,000
yeah and that must be the thing okay so
 

1763
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,470
yeah and that must be the thing okay so
that's an

1764
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:18,480
that's an
 

1765
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,590
that's an
engine um so that is

1766
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:21,600
engine um so that is
 

1767
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,549
engine um so that is
kind of the ionization chamber and

1768
00:32:24,549 --> 00:32:24,559
kind of the ionization chamber and
 

1769
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:26,870
kind of the ionization chamber and
thrust producing part of it what's not

1770
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:26,880
thrust producing part of it what's not
 

1771
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,149
thrust producing part of it what's not
shown you know in that picture um is

1772
00:32:30,149 --> 00:32:30,159
shown you know in that picture um is
 

1773
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:32,630
shown you know in that picture um is
the propellant tank so we can keep

1774
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:32,640
the propellant tank so we can keep
 

1775
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,470
the propellant tank so we can keep
supplying more and more of the liquid to

1776
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:34,480
supplying more and more of the liquid to
 

1777
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,909
supplying more and more of the liquid to
those

1778
00:32:35,909 --> 00:32:35,919
those
 

1779
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:38,630
those
emission sites and then we also provide

1780
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:38,640
emission sites and then we also provide
 

1781
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,389
emission sites and then we also provide
a power electronic system

1782
00:32:40,389 --> 00:32:40,399
a power electronic system
 

1783
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:42,470
a power electronic system
that talks to the spacecraft and turns

1784
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:42,480
that talks to the spacecraft and turns
 

1785
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,669
that talks to the spacecraft and turns
our device on and off

1786
00:32:43,669 --> 00:32:43,679
our device on and off
 

1787
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:46,070
our device on and off
so that's the colloid engine that's the

1788
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:46,080
so that's the colloid engine that's the
 

1789
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,789
so that's the colloid engine that's the
core of the coolidge um it's

1790
00:32:48,789 --> 00:32:48,799
core of the coolidge um it's
 

1791
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,630
core of the coolidge um it's
the way i've been talking about it it's

1792
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:50,640
the way i've been talking about it it's
 

1793
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,909
the way i've been talking about it it's
um more of

1794
00:32:51,909 --> 00:32:51,919
um more of
 

1795
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:55,590
um more of
ion electrospray colloid um

1796
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:55,600
ion electrospray colloid um
 

1797
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,950
ion electrospray colloid um
tends to mean like liquid droplets

1798
00:32:58,950 --> 00:32:58,960
tends to mean like liquid droplets
 

1799
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,389
tends to mean like liquid droplets
coming off of the jet

1800
00:33:00,389 --> 00:33:00,399
coming off of the jet
 

1801
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:02,789
coming off of the jet
but if you make smaller and smaller

1802
00:33:02,789 --> 00:33:02,799
but if you make smaller and smaller
 

1803
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:04,789
but if you make smaller and smaller
cones you get pure ions

1804
00:33:04,789 --> 00:33:04,799
cones you get pure ions
 

1805
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:06,230
cones you get pure ions
so we're kind of like a subset of

1806
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:06,240
so we're kind of like a subset of
 

1807
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,830
so we're kind of like a subset of
colloid yes what

1808
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:07,840
colloid yes what
 

1809
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,070
colloid yes what
uh aspects of this you said that it's

1810
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:10,080
uh aspects of this you said that it's
 

1811
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,909
uh aspects of this you said that it's
been full of mystery from the physics

1812
00:33:11,909 --> 00:33:11,919
been full of mystery from the physics
 

1813
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:13,190
been full of mystery from the physics
perspective

1814
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:13,200
perspective
 

1815
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,630
perspective
what aspects of this are understood and

1816
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:16,640
what aspects of this are understood and
 

1817
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,070
what aspects of this are understood and
what are still full of mystery yeah

1818
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:20,080
what are still full of mystery yeah
 

1819
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,190
what are still full of mystery yeah
recently um we've been

1820
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:23,200
recently um we've been
 

1821
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,870
recently um we've been
understanding the kind of instabilities

1822
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:26,880
understanding the kind of instabilities
 

1823
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,070
understanding the kind of instabilities
and and stable regimes of

1824
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:30,080
and and stable regimes of
 

1825
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,830
and and stable regimes of
um you know how much liquid do you

1826
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:31,840
um you know how much liquid do you
 

1827
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,470
um you know how much liquid do you
supply and and what field do you apply

1828
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:34,480
supply and and what field do you apply
 

1829
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,830
supply and and what field do you apply
and um why is it flickering on and off

1830
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:37,840
and um why is it flickering on and off
 

1831
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,110
and um why is it flickering on and off
or why does it have these weird

1832
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:39,120
or why does it have these weird
 

1833
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,470
or why does it have these weird
behaviors so that's

1834
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:40,480
behaviors so that's
 

1835
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,110
behaviors so that's
in the past just couple years that's

1836
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:43,120
in the past just couple years that's
 

1837
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,870
in the past just couple years that's
become much more

1838
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:44,880
become much more
 

1839
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,909
become much more
understood um i think the two

1840
00:33:47,909 --> 00:33:47,919
understood um i think the two
 

1841
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:51,269
understood um i think the two
areas that come to mind as far as um

1842
00:33:51,269 --> 00:33:51,279
areas that come to mind as far as um
 

1843
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:54,549
areas that come to mind as far as um
not as well understood are um

1844
00:33:54,549 --> 00:33:54,559
not as well understood are um
 

1845
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:57,750
not as well understood are um
the boundary between you know you have

1846
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:57,760
the boundary between you know you have
 

1847
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,789
the boundary between you know you have
um we we actually use kind of big

1848
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:00,799
um we we actually use kind of big
 

1849
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:01,750

1851
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:05,110
molecular
ions and if you're looking at

1852
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:05,120
ions and if you're looking at
 

1853
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,470
ions and if you're looking at
the molecular scale you have

1854
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:08,480
the molecular scale you have
 

1855
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,310
the molecular scale you have
you know some ions that you've extracted

00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:10,320
you know some ions that you've extracted
 

1857
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,790
you know some ions that you've extracted
and they're in this electric field

1858
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:12,800
and they're in this electric field
 

1859
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,069
and they're in this electric field
one ion you know it's a big molecule

1860
00:34:16,069 --> 00:34:16,079
one ion you know it's a big molecule
 

1861
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:18,790
one ion you know it's a big molecule
it's getting energy from the electric

1862
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:18,800
it's getting energy from the electric
 

1863
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,069
it's getting energy from the electric
field and some of that energy

1864
00:34:20,069 --> 00:34:20,079
field and some of that energy
 

1865
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:22,310
field and some of that energy
is going into the bonds and making it

1866
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:22,320
is going into the bonds and making it
 

1867
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,149
is going into the bonds and making it
vibrate and doing weird things to it

1868
00:34:24,149 --> 00:34:24,159
vibrate and doing weird things to it
 

1869
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:26,389
vibrate and doing weird things to it
sometimes it breaks them apart

1870
00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:26,399
sometimes it breaks them apart

and then zooming out to the whole beam

1872
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:30,320
and then zooming out to the whole beam
 

1873
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,190
and then zooming out to the whole beam
the beam has some behaviors as this beam

nano yeah i mean you're it's if you look

1972
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:20,240
nano yeah i mean you're it's if you look
 

1973
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,589
nano yeah i mean you're it's if you look
further it's quantum

1974
00:36:21,589 --> 00:36:21,599
further it's quantum
 

1975
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:24,790
further it's quantum
too but it it all is

1976
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:24,800
too but it it all is
 

1977
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,870
too but it it all is
you capillary action at the quantum

1978
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:26,880
you capillary action at the quantum
 

1979
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,109
you capillary action at the quantum
level yeah so i would

1980
00:36:29,109 --> 00:36:29,119
level yeah so i would
 

1981
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:32,230
level yeah so i would
i i it all comes back to me to

1982
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:32,240
i i it all comes back to me to
 

1983
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,910
i i it all comes back to me to
you know material science there's so

1984
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:33,920
you know material science there's so
 

1985
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,349

much we don't understand

1986
00:36:35,349 --> 00:36:35,359
much we don't understand
 

1987
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,790
much we don't understand
at these sizes um and i

1988
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:38,800
at these sizes um and i
 

1989
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:43,190
at these sizes um and i
i find that inspiring and exciting

1990
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:43,200
i find that inspiring and exciting
 

1991
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,990
i find that inspiring and exciting
and then more broadly you know i

1992
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:46,000
and then more broadly you know i
 

1993
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,109
and then more broadly you know i
remember when i learned that the same

1994
00:36:49,109 --> 00:36:49,119
remember when i learned that the same
 

1995
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:52,310
remember when i learned that the same

00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:11,680
same but you know what i mean this
 

2015
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,230
same but you know what i mean this
connectedness i find really

2016

conclusion is using
 

2037
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:34,230
conclusion is using
is using like shortcuts to program it

2038
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:34,240
is using like shortcuts to program it
 

2039
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,910
is using like shortcuts to program it
like they didn't they just copy and

2040
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:35,920
like they didn't they just copy and
 

2041
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,069
like they didn't they just copy and
pasted some code for the different parts

2042
00:37:38,069 --> 00:37:38,079
pasted some code for the different parts
 

2043
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:40,310
pasted some code for the different parts
yeah think of something new or just

2044
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:40,320
yeah think of something new or just
 

2045
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,430
yeah think of something new or just
paste from over there

2046
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:41,440
paste from over there
 

2047
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,910
paste from over there
they won't notice my conclusion from

2048
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:43,920
they won't notice my conclusion from
 

2049
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,550
they won't notice my conclusion from
that was

2050
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:44,560
that was
 

2051
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,950
that was
i'm gonna go interview for finance jobs

2052
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:46,960
i'm gonna go interview for finance jobs
 

2053
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,349
i'm gonna go interview for finance jobs
so i had like a little detour

2054
00:37:49,349 --> 00:37:49,359
so i had like a little detour
 

2055
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:51,670
so i had like a little detour
that's the back that's the backup option

2056
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:51,680
that's the back that's the backup option
 

2057
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,550
that's the back that's the backup option
so

2058
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:52,560
so
 

2059
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,990
so
in terms of using uh kohler engines

2060
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:56,000
in terms of using uh kohler engines
 

2061
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,829
in terms of using uh kohler engines
what's what's an interesting difference

2062
00:37:57,829 --> 00:37:57,839
what's what's an interesting difference
 

2063
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:00,550
what's what's an interesting difference
between a propulsion of a rocket

2064
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:00,560
between a propulsion of a rocket
 

2065
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,470
between a propulsion of a rocket
from earth when you're standing in the

2066
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:02,480
from earth when you're standing in the
 

2067
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,069
from earth when you're standing in the
ground to orbit

2068
00:38:04,069 --> 00:38:04,079
ground to orbit
 

2069
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:05,990
ground to orbit
and then the kind of propulsion

2070
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:06,000
and then the kind of propulsion
 

2071
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,910
and then the kind of propulsion
necessary for once you get out

2072
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:07,920
necessary for once you get out
 

2073
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,270
necessary for once you get out
or better to like deep space to

2074
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:11,280
or better to like deep space to
 

2075
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:15,910
or better to like deep space to
to move around yes the reason

2076
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:15,920
to move around yes the reason
 

2077
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,589
to move around yes the reason
you can't use an engine like mine

2078
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:19,599
you can't use an engine like mine
 

2079
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:23,030
you can't use an engine like mine
to get off the ground is

2080
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:23,040
to get off the ground is
 

2081
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,670
to get off the ground is
you know the thrust it generates is

2082
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:25,680
you know the thrust it generates is
 

2083
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,990
you know the thrust it generates is
instantaneous thrust is very small but

2084
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:28,000
instantaneous thrust is very small but
 

2085
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,349
instantaneous thrust is very small but
if you

2086
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:29,359
if you
 

2087
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:31,430
if you
if you have the time and and can

2088
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:31,440
if you have the time and and can
 

2089
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,430
if you have the time and and can
accumulate that acceleration you can

2090
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:33,440
accumulate that acceleration you can
 

2091
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,750
accumulate that acceleration you can
still reach speeds that are

2092
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:35,760
still reach speeds that are
 

2093
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,069
still reach speeds that are
very interesting for exploration and and

2094
00:38:38,069 --> 00:38:38,079
very interesting for exploration and and
 

2095
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:39,670
very interesting for exploration and and
even for missions with

2096
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:39,680
even for missions with
 

2097
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:44,390
even for missions with
humans on them um an interesting

2098
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:44,400
humans on them um an interesting
 

2099
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,589
humans on them um an interesting
direction i think we need to go as as

2100
00:38:47,589 --> 00:38:47,599
direction i think we need to go as as
 

2101
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:48,310

00:38:51,589 --> 00:38:51,599
exploring space is um the power supplies
 

2105
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:53,589
exploring space is um the power supplies
for electric propulsion are

2106
00:38:53,589 --> 00:38:53,599
for electric propulsion are
 

2107
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:56,710
for electric propulsion are
are limiting us in that

2108
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:56,720
are limiting us in that
 

2109
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,150
are limiting us in that
you know solar panels are really

2110
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:58,160
you know solar panels are really
 

2111
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,230
you know solar panels are really
inefficient and bulky and

2112
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:00,240
inefficient and bulky and
 

2113
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,990
inefficient and bulky and
batteries i don't know when anybody's

2114
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:02,000
batteries i don't know when anybody's
 

2115
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,829
batteries i don't know when anybody's
ever going to

2116
00:39:03,829 --> 00:39:03,839
ever going to
 

2117
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:06,069
ever going to
improve battery technology i know a lot

2118
00:39:06,069 --> 00:39:06,079
improve battery technology i know a lot
 

2119
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:09,109
improve battery technology i know a lot
of people that work on that

2120
00:39:09,109 --> 00:39:09,119

 

2121
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:12,390

and nuclear power you

2122
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:12,400
and nuclear power you
 

2123
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,230
and nuclear power you
we could have a lot more powerful

2124
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:14,240
we could have a lot more powerful
 

2125
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,829
we could have a lot more powerful
electric propulsion systems so they

2126
00:39:15,829 --> 00:39:15,839
electric propulsion systems so they
 

2127
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:16,470
electric propulsion systems so they
would be

2128
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:16,480
would be
 

2129
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,870
would be
extremely fuel efficient but more

2130
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:18,880
extremely fuel efficient but more
 

2131
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,390
extremely fuel efficient but more
instantaneous for us to do more

2132
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:20,400
instantaneous for us to do more
 

2133
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,430
instantaneous for us to do more
interesting missions

2134
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:21,440
interesting missions
 

2135
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,030
interesting missions
um if we could start launching more

2136
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:23,040
um if we could start launching more
 

2137
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,109
um if we could start launching more
nuclear systems but

2138
00:39:25,109 --> 00:39:25,119
nuclear systems but
 

2139
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:27,829
nuclear systems but
so like so something that's powered

2140
00:39:27,829 --> 00:39:27,839
so like so something that's powered
 

2141
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:29,430
so like so something that's powered
nuclear-powered

2142
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:29,440
nuclear-powered
 

2143
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,630
nuclear-powered
that's the right way to say it yeah

2144
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:32,640
that's the right way to say it yeah
 

2145
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,109
that's the right way to say it yeah
but is it a small enough container that

2146
00:39:35,109 --> 00:39:35,119
but is it a small enough container that
 

2147
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:36,310
but is it a small enough container that
could be launched

2148
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:36,320
could be launched
 

2149
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,390
could be launched
yeah so um i mean as a world we do

2150
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:40,400
yeah so um i mean as a world we do
 

2151
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,750
yeah so um i mean as a world we do
launch spacecraft with nuclear power

2152
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:43,760
launch spacecraft with nuclear power
 

2153
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,950
launch spacecraft with nuclear power
systems on board but size is is one

2154
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:46,960
systems on board but size is is one
 

2155
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,950
systems on board but size is is one
consideration it hasn't been a big focus

2156
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:48,960
consideration it hasn't been a big focus
 

2157
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,150
consideration it hasn't been a big focus
so the

2158
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:50,160
so the
 

2159
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,310
so the
the reactors and the heaters and

2160
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:52,320
the reactors and the heaters and
 

2161
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,349
the reactors and the heaters and
everything are

2162
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:53,359
everything are
 

2163
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:54,710
everything are
bulky and so they're really only

2164
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:54,720
bulky and so they're really only
 

2165
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,430
bulky and so they're really only
suitable for some of the much bigger

2166
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:57,440
suitable for some of the much bigger
 

2167
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,310
suitable for some of the much bigger
interplanetary stuff um so that's one

2168
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:00,320
interplanetary stuff um so that's one
 

2169
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,470
interplanetary stuff um so that's one
issue but then it's a whole like

2170
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:02,480
issue but then it's a whole like
 

2171
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,069
issue but then it's a whole like
rat's nest of political stuff as well

2172
00:40:06,069 --> 00:40:06,079
rat's nest of political stuff as well
 

2173
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:09,109
rat's nest of political stuff as well
i i heard i think elon described or

2174
00:40:09,109 --> 00:40:09,119
i i heard i think elon described or
 

2175
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:09,670
i i heard i think elon described or
somebody

2176
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:09,680
somebody
 

2177
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,349
somebody
i think i think it was elon described

2178
00:40:11,349 --> 00:40:11,359
i think i think it was elon described
 

2179
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:13,510
i think i think it was elon described
the uh ev tall like

2180
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:13,520
the uh ev tall like
 

2181
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:17,109
the uh ev tall like
electrical vertical takeoff and landing

2182
00:40:17,109 --> 00:40:17,119
electrical vertical takeoff and landing
 

2183
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:18,870
electrical vertical takeoff and landing
vehicles so basically saying rockets

2184
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:18,880
vehicles so basically saying rockets
 

2185
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,109
vehicles so basically saying rockets
i'm obviously elon is interested in

2186
00:40:21,109 --> 00:40:21,119
i'm obviously elon is interested in
 

2187
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,390
i'm obviously elon is interested in
electric vehicles right

2188
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:22,400
electric vehicles right
 

2189
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,430
electric vehicles right
but he said that rockets can't

2190
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:25,440
but he said that rockets can't
 

2191
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,150
but he said that rockets can't
uh in the in the near term it doesn't

2192
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:28,160
uh in the in the near term it doesn't
 

2193
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,430
uh in the in the near term it doesn't
make sense for them to be electrical

2194
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:31,440
make sense for them to be electrical
 

2195
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,470
make sense for them to be electrical
uh what do you see a world with the

2196
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:34,480
uh what do you see a world with the
 

2197
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,190
uh what do you see a world with the
rockets

2198
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:35,200
rockets
 

2199
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,390
rockets
that we use to get into orbit are also

2200
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:38,400
that we use to get into orbit are also
 

2201
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,750
that we use to get into orbit are also
electric based uh it's possible you can

2202
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:41,760
electric based uh it's possible you can
 

2203
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,670
electric based uh it's possible you can
produce the thrust levels you need but

2204
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:43,680
produce the thrust levels you need but
 

2205
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,109
produce the thrust levels you need but
you need this

2206
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:45,119
you need this
 

2207
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:47,589
you need this
uh a much bigger power supply and i

2208
00:40:47,589 --> 00:40:47,599
uh a much bigger power supply and i
 

2209
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:49,109
uh a much bigger power supply and i
think that would be nuclear

2210
00:40:49,109 --> 00:40:49,119
think that would be nuclear
 

2211
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:51,270
think that would be nuclear
and the only way people have been able

2212
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:51,280
and the only way people have been able
 

2213
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,309
and the only way people have been able
to launch them at all

2214
00:40:52,309 --> 00:40:52,319
to launch them at all
 

2215
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:55,109
to launch them at all
is that they're in a you know 100 times

2216
00:40:55,109 --> 00:40:55,119
is that they're in a you know 100 times
 

2217
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,069
is that they're in a you know 100 times
redundancy

2218
00:40:56,069 --> 00:40:56,079
redundancy
 

2219
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:57,990
redundancy
safe mode while they're being launched

2220
00:40:57,990 --> 00:40:58,000
safe mode while they're being launched
 

2221
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,750
safe mode while they're being launched
and they're not turned on until

2222
00:40:59,750 --> 00:40:59,760
and they're not turned on until
 

2223
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,349
and they're not turned on until
they're farther off so if you were to

2224
00:41:01,349 --> 00:41:01,359
they're farther off so if you were to
 

2225
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:02,790
they're farther off so if you were to
actually try to use it on

2226
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:02,800
actually try to use it on
 

2227
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,349
actually try to use it on
launch i think a lot of people would

2228
00:41:05,349 --> 00:41:05,359
launch i think a lot of people would
 

2229
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:07,190
launch i think a lot of people would
still have an issue with that but

2230
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:07,200
still have an issue with that but
 

2231
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,109
still have an issue with that but
someday it's a it's an interesting

2232
00:41:09,109 --> 00:41:09,119
someday it's a it's an interesting
 

2233
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:10,870
someday it's a it's an interesting
concept nuclear

2234
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:10,880
concept nuclear
 

2235
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,030
concept nuclear
it seems like people like everybody that

2236
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:13,040
it seems like people like everybody that
 

2237
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,710
it seems like people like everybody that
works on nuclear power

2238
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:14,720
works on nuclear power
 

2239
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,109
works on nuclear power
has shown how safe it is as a source of

2240
00:41:17,109 --> 00:41:17,119
has shown how safe it is as a source of
 

2241
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:18,230
has shown how safe it is as a source of

2243
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:22,150
value
and uh and yet we are seem to be

2244
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:22,160
and uh and yet we are seem to be
 

2245
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,069
and uh and yet we are seem to be
i mean based on the history based on the

00:41:24,069 --> 00:41:24,079
i mean based on the history based on the
 

2247
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:25,430
i mean based on the history based on the
excellent hbo

2248
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:25,440
excellent hbo
 

2249
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,230
excellent hbo
series russian with the chernobyl it

2250
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:28,240
series russian with the chernobyl it
 

2251
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,270
series russian with the chernobyl it
seems like we have

2252
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:29,280
seems like we have
 

2253
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,510
seems like we have
our risk estimation about this

2254
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:31,520
our risk estimation about this
 

2255
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,829
our risk estimation about this
particular power

2256
00:41:33,829 --> 00:41:33,839
particular power
 

2257
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:36,470
particular power
drastically inaccurate but that's that's

2258
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:36,480
drastically inaccurate but that's that's
 

2259
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,710
drastically inaccurate but that's that's
a fascinating idea that we would

2260
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:38,720
a fascinating idea that we would
 

2261
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:42,069
a fascinating idea that we would
use nuclear as a source for our vehicles

2262
00:41:42,069 --> 00:41:42,079
use nuclear as a source for our vehicles
 

2263
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:44,230
use nuclear as a source for our vehicles
uh and not just in outer space that's

2264
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:44,240
uh and not just in outer space that's
 

2265
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,750
uh and not just in outer space that's
cool i'm going to look into that

2266
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:45,760
cool i'm going to look into that
 

2267
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,069
cool i'm going to look into that
that's super interesting well um just

2268
00:41:48,069 --> 00:41:48,079
that's super interesting well um just
 

2269
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:49,270
that's super interesting well um just
last year

2270
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:49,280
last year
 

2271
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,109

starting to
 

2279
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,950
starting to
pick up on the development so now is a

2280
00:41:58,950 --> 00:41:58,960
pick up on the development so now is a
 

2281
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,230
pick up on the development so now is a
good time to look into it because

2282
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:00,240
good time to look into it because
 

2283
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,150
good time to look into it because
there's actually some movement

2284
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:02,160
there's actually some movement
 

2285
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,069
there's actually some movement
is that a hope for you to to explore

2286
00:42:04,069 --> 00:42:04,079
is that a hope for you to to explore
 

2287
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:05,510
is that a hope for you to to explore
different energy sources

2288
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:05,520
different energy sources

00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:09,200
something
 

2293
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,910
something
like uh like the entirety of the

2294
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:11,920
like uh like the entirety of the
 

2295
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,069
like uh like the entirety of the
propulsion systems for all aspects of

2296
00:42:14,069 --> 00:42:14,079
propulsion systems for all aspects of
 

2297
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:15,589
propulsion systems for all aspects of
the vehicle's

2298
00:42:15,589 --> 00:42:15,599
the vehicle's
 

2299
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:18,950
the vehicle's
life travel is the same or electric is

2300
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:18,960
life travel is the same or electric is
 

2301
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,790
life travel is the same or electric is
it possible for it to be the same like

2302
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:20,800
it possible for it to be the same like
 

2303
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,870
it possible for it to be the same like
the cool load engine being used for

2304
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:22,880
the cool load engine being used for
 

2305
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,230
the cool load engine being used for
everything

2306
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:24,240
everything
 

2307
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,470
everything
you could and you would have to do it in

2308
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:26,480
you could and you would have to do it in
 

2309
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,270
you could and you would have to do it in
the same way

2310
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:27,280
the same way
 

2311
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,349
the same way
we do different stages of rockets now

2312
00:42:29,349 --> 00:42:29,359
we do different stages of rockets now
 

2313
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:30,950
we do different stages of rockets now
where once you've

2314
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:30,960
where once you've
 

2315
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,990
where once you've
used up an engine

2316
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:34,000
used up an engine
 

2317
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,990
used up an engine
or a stage you let it go because there's

2318
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:36,000
or a stage you let it go because there's
 

2319
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,430
or a stage you let it go because there's
really no point in holding onto it so i

2320
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:37,440
really no point in holding onto it so i
 

2321
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,109
really no point in holding onto it so i
wouldn't necessarily want to use

2322
00:42:39,109 --> 00:42:39,119
wouldn't necessarily want to use
 

2323
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:41,510
wouldn't necessarily want to use
the the same engine for the whole thing

2324
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:41,520
the the same engine for the whole thing
 

2325
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,430
the the same engine for the whole thing
but the same technology i think would be

2326
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:43,440
but the same technology i think would be
 

2327
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,870
but the same technology i think would be
interesting

2328
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:44,880
interesting
 

2329
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,589
interesting
okay so it's possible all right but uh

2330
00:42:47,589 --> 00:42:47,599
okay so it's possible all right but uh
 

2331
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:47,910
okay so it's possible all right but uh
yeah

2332
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:47,920
yeah
 

2333
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,349
yeah
it turns down to the power source the

2334
00:42:49,349 --> 00:42:49,359
it turns down to the power source the
 

2335
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:50,630
it turns down to the power source the
power source it's that's really

2336
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:50,640
power source it's that's really
 

2337
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:51,910
power source it's that's really
interesting but for the current power

2338
00:42:51,910 --> 00:42:51,920
interesting but for the current power
 

2339
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,990
interesting but for the current power
sources and its current use cases

2340
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:54,000
sources and its current use cases
 

2341
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,670
sources and its current use cases
what's the use case for electric like

2342
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:55,680
what's the use case for electric like
 

2343
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,790
what's the use case for electric like
the the the corallite engine

2344
00:42:58,790 --> 00:42:58,800
the the the corallite engine
 

2345
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,390
the the the corallite engine
can you talk about where they're used

2346
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:00,400
can you talk about where they're used
 

2347
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,230
can you talk about where they're used
today sure

2348
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:02,240
today sure
 

2349
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:05,510
today sure
so chemical engines are still used

2350
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:05,520
so chemical engines are still used
 

2351
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,990
so chemical engines are still used
um quite a bit once you're in orbit but

2352
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:08,000
um quite a bit once you're in orbit but
 

2353
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:08,550
um quite a bit once you're in orbit but
that's

2354
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:08,560
that's
 

2355
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,030
that's
also where you might choose instead to

2356
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:11,040
also where you might choose instead to
 

2357
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,470
also where you might choose instead to
use an electric system

2358
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:12,480
use an electric system
 

2359
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,670
use an electric system
and what people do with them and

2360
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:15,680
and what people do with them and
 

2361
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,109
and what people do with them and
and this includes you know the ion

2362
00:43:17,109 --> 00:43:17,119
and this includes you know the ion
 

2363
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:19,030
and this includes you know the ion
engines and health thrusters and orange

2364
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:19,040
engines and health thrusters and orange
 

2365
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:19,750
engines and health thrusters and orange
and

2366
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:19,760
and
 

2367
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,990
and
um there's basically any maneuvering you

2368
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:22,000
um there's basically any maneuvering you
 

2369
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,910
um there's basically any maneuvering you
need to do once you're dropped off

2370
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:23,920
need to do once you're dropped off
 

2371
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:27,829
need to do once you're dropped off
um there's even if your only goal was to

2372
00:43:27,829 --> 00:43:27,839
um there's even if your only goal was to
 

2373
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:28,870
um there's even if your only goal was to
just

2374
00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:28,880
just
 

2375
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,190
just
stay in your orbit and not move for the

2376
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:31,200
stay in your orbit and not move for the
 

2377
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,390
stay in your orbit and not move for the
life of your mission

2378
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:32,400
life of your mission
 

2379
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,470
life of your mission
you need propulsion to accomplish that

2380
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:34,480
you need propulsion to accomplish that
 

2381
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,230
you need propulsion to accomplish that
because the

2382
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:36,240
because the
 

2383
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,550
because the
earth's gravity field changes as you go

2384
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:38,560
earth's gravity field changes as you go
 

2385
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,390
earth's gravity field changes as you go
around in orbit and pulls you out of

2386
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:40,400
around in orbit and pulls you out of
 

2387
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,109
around in orbit and pulls you out of
your

2388
00:43:41,109 --> 00:43:41,119
your
 

2389
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,470
your
little box um there are other

2390
00:43:43,470 --> 00:43:43,480
little box um there are other
 

2391
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:44,630
little box um there are other
perturbations

2392
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:44,640
perturbations
 

2393
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:48,069
perturbations
um that that can throw you off a bit

2394
00:43:48,069 --> 00:43:48,079
um that that can throw you off a bit
 

2395
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:50,309
um that that can throw you off a bit
and then you know most people want to do

2396
00:43:50,309 --> 00:43:50,319
and then you know most people want to do
 

2397
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:51,910
and then you know most people want to do
things a little bit more interesting

2398
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:51,920
things a little bit more interesting
 

2399
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:52,790
things a little bit more interesting
like

2400
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:52,800
like
 

2401
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,270
like
maneuver to avoid being hit by space

2402
00:43:55,270 --> 00:43:55,280
maneuver to avoid being hit by space
 

2403
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:55,910
maneuver to avoid being hit by space
debris

2404
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:55,920
debris
 

2405
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,270
debris
or perhaps lower their orbit to take a

2406
00:43:59,270 --> 00:43:59,280
or perhaps lower their orbit to take a
 

2407
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,190
or perhaps lower their orbit to take a
higher resolution image of something and

2408
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:01,200
higher resolution image of something and
 

2409
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,870
higher resolution image of something and
then return

2410
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:02,880
then return
 

2411
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,910
then return
at the end of your mission you're

2412
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:05,920
at the end of your mission you're
 

2413
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:08,870
at the end of your mission you're
supposed to responsibly get rid of your

2414
00:44:08,870 --> 00:44:08,880
supposed to responsibly get rid of your
 

2415
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,870
supposed to responsibly get rid of your
satellite whether that's

2416
00:44:10,870 --> 00:44:10,880
satellite whether that's
 

2417
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,510
satellite whether that's
burning it up but if you're in geo you

2418
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:13,520
burning it up but if you're in geo you
 

2419
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,349
burning it up but if you're in geo you
want to push it higher into graveyard

2420
00:44:15,349 --> 00:44:15,359
want to push it higher into graveyard
 

2421
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:16,230
want to push it higher into graveyard
orbit

2422
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:16,240
orbit
 

2423
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:19,910
orbit
um what's geo what's um so low earth

2424
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:19,920
um what's geo what's um so low earth
 

2425
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,910
um what's geo what's um so low earth
orbit and then geosynchronous orbit or

2426
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:21,920
orbit and then geosynchronous orbit or
 

2427
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,109
orbit and then geosynchronous orbit or
geostationary orbit

2428
00:44:23,109 --> 00:44:23,119
geostationary orbit
 

2429
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:25,829
geostationary orbit
and there's a graveyard yeah so those

2430
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:25,839
and there's a graveyard yeah so those
 

2431
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:26,870
and there's a graveyard yeah so those
satellites are at

2432
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:26,880
satellites are at
 

2433
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,750
satellites are at
um like 40 000 kilometers so if they

2434
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:29,760
um like 40 000 kilometers so if they
 

2435
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,109
um like 40 000 kilometers so if they
were to try to push

2436
00:44:31,109 --> 00:44:31,119
were to try to push
 

2437
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:34,309
were to try to push
their satellites back down to burn up in

2438
00:44:34,309 --> 00:44:34,319
their satellites back down to burn up in
 

2439
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:35,270
their satellites back down to burn up in
the atmosphere

2440
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:35,280
the atmosphere
 

2441
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,870
the atmosphere
they would need you know even more

2442
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:36,880
they would need you know even more
 

2443
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,790
they would need you know even more
propulsion than they've had for the

2444
00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:38,800
propulsion than they've had for the
 

2445
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,390
propulsion than they've had for the
whole lifetime of their mission

2446
00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:40,400
whole lifetime of their mission
 

2447
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,470
whole lifetime of their mission
so instead they push them higher where

2448
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:42,480
so instead they push them higher where
 

2449
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,230
so instead they push them higher where
it'll take you know a million years for

2450
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:44,240
it'll take you know a million years for
 

2451
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,670
it'll take you know a million years for
it to naturally

2452
00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:45,680
it to naturally
 

2453
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:48,630
it to naturally
deorbit so we're also cluttering that

2454
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:48,640
deorbit so we're also cluttering that
 

2455
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:49,430
deorbit so we're also cluttering that
higher bit

2456
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:49,440
higher bit
 

2457
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,990
higher bit
up as well but it's not as pressing as

2458
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:52,000
up as well but it's not as pressing as
 

2459
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:52,550
up as well but it's not as pressing as
as

2460
00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:52,560

of these commercial missions are going

2464
00:44:55,829 --> 00:44:55,839
of these commercial missions are going
 

2465
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:56,150
of these commercial missions are going
now

2466
00:44:56,150 --> 00:44:56,160
now
 

2467
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,069
now
cool so how hard is the collision

2468
00:44:58,069 --> 00:44:58,079
cool so how hard is the collision
 

2469
00:44:58,079 --> 00:44:59,750
cool so how hard is the collision
avoidance problem there you said some

2470
00:44:59,750 --> 00:44:59,760
avoidance problem there you said some
 

2471
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,510
avoidance problem there you said some
debris and stuff so like

2472
00:45:01,510 --> 00:45:01,520
debris and stuff so like
 

2473
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,910
debris and stuff so like
how much propulsion is needed like how

2474
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:03,920
how much propulsion is needed like how
 

2475
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,750
how much propulsion is needed like how
much is the the life of a satellite is

2476
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:05,760
much is the the life of a satellite is
 

2477
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:06,470
much is the the life of a satellite is
just like

2478
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:06,480
just like
 

2479
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,390
just like
oh crap trying trying to avoid like

2480
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:08,400
oh crap trying trying to avoid like
 

2481
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,069
oh crap trying trying to avoid like
literally i think

2482
00:45:10,069 --> 00:45:10,079
literally i think
 

2483
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:13,589
literally i think
one of the recent um you know rules of

2484
00:45:13,589 --> 00:45:13,599
one of the recent um you know rules of
 

2485
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:13,990
one of the recent um you know rules of
thumb

2486
00:45:13,990 --> 00:45:14,000
thumb
 

2487
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,870
thumb
i heard was per year some of these small

2488
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:16,880
i heard was per year some of these small
 

2489
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,710
i heard was per year some of these small
satellites are doing like three

2490
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:18,720
satellites are doing like three
 

2491
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,829
satellites are doing like three
collision avoidance maneuvers um so

2492
00:45:21,829 --> 00:45:21,839
collision avoidance maneuvers um so
 

2493
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:22,309
collision avoidance maneuvers um so
that's

2494
00:45:22,309 --> 00:45:22,319
that's
 

2495
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:25,589
that's
that's not yeah but it's not zero um

2496
00:45:25,589 --> 00:45:25,599
that's not yeah but it's not zero um
 

2497
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:28,710
that's not yeah but it's not zero um
and it yeah it takes a lot of um

2498
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:28,720
and it yeah it takes a lot of um
 

2499
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,950
and it yeah it takes a lot of um
planning and people on the ground and

2500
00:45:30,950 --> 00:45:30,960
planning and people on the ground and
 

2501
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,150
planning and people on the ground and
you know

2502
00:45:32,150 --> 00:45:32,160
you know
 

2503
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,309
you know
none of that really i don't think right

2504
00:45:34,309 --> 00:45:34,319
none of that really i don't think right
 

2505
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:36,069
none of that really i don't think right
now is autonomous

2506
00:45:36,069 --> 00:45:36,079
now is autonomous
 

2507
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:38,630
now is autonomous
oh that's not good yeah and then we have

2508
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:38,640
oh that's not good yeah and then we have
 

2509
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:39,750
oh that's not good yeah and then we have
a lot of folks

2510
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:39,760
a lot of folks
 

2511
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,510
a lot of folks
taking advantage of you know moore's

2512
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:41,520
taking advantage of you know moore's
 

2513
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,190
taking advantage of you know moore's
lawn cheaper spacecraft so they're

2514
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:43,200
lawn cheaper spacecraft so they're
 

2515
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:44,870
lawn cheaper spacecraft so they're
launching them up without the ability to

2516
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:44,880
launching them up without the ability to
 

2517
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,150
launching them up without the ability to
maneuver themselves and they're like

2518
00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:46,160
maneuver themselves and they're like
 

2519
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:46,950
maneuver themselves and they're like
well

2520
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:46,960
well
 

2521
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,430
well
i don't know just don't hit me and three

2522
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:49,440
i don't know just don't hit me and three
 

2523
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,870
i don't know just don't hit me and three
times a year that could be become

2524
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:50,880
times a year that could be become
 

2525
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,109
times a year that could be become
affordable if it's like

2526
00:45:53,109 --> 00:45:53,119
affordable if it's like
 

2527
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:55,510
affordable if it's like
if it gets hit maybe it won't be damaged

2528
00:45:55,510 --> 00:45:55,520
if it gets hit maybe it won't be damaged
 

2529
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:56,150
if it gets hit maybe it won't be damaged
kind of thing

2530
00:45:56,150 --> 00:45:56,160
kind of thing
 

2531
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:59,270
kind of thing
that kind of logic affordable in that

2532
00:45:59,270 --> 00:45:59,280
that kind of logic affordable in that
 

2533
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,710
that kind of logic affordable in that
instead of launching one satellite

2534
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:00,720
instead of launching one satellite
 

2535
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,550
instead of launching one satellite
they'll launch you know 20 small ones

2536
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:02,560
they'll launch you know 20 small ones
 

2537
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,390
they'll launch you know 20 small ones
yeah so if one gets taken out

2538
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:04,400
yeah so if one gets taken out
 

2539
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,230
yeah so if one gets taken out
that's okay but the problem is that you

2540
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:06,240
that's okay but the problem is that you
 

2541
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,230
that's okay but the problem is that you
know one good-sized satellite getting

2542
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:08,240
know one good-sized satellite getting
 

2543
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,030
know one good-sized satellite getting
hit

2544
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:09,040
hit
 

2545
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,750
hit
um that's like a ballistic event that

2546
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:11,760
um that's like a ballistic event that
 

2547
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,230
um that's like a ballistic event that
turns into 10 000 pieces of debris that

2548
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:14,240
turns into 10 000 pieces of debris that
 

2549
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,390
turns into 10 000 pieces of debris that
then are the things that go and hit the

2550
00:46:16,390 --> 00:46:16,400
then are the things that go and hit the
 

2551
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,349
then are the things that go and hit the
other satellites

2552
00:46:17,349 --> 00:46:17,359
other satellites
 

2553
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:20,390
other satellites
yeah so do you see a world where

2554
00:46:20,390 --> 00:46:20,400
yeah so do you see a world where
 

2555
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:23,510
yeah so do you see a world where
like in your sense in your own work and

2556
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:23,520
like in your sense in your own work and
 

2557
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,670
like in your sense in your own work and
just in the space industry in general do

2558
00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:25,680
just in the space industry in general do
 

2559
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,270
just in the space industry in general do
you see that people are moving towards

2560
00:46:27,270 --> 00:46:27,280
you see that people are moving towards
 

2561
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,589
you see that people are moving towards
bigger satellites or smaller satellites

2562
00:46:29,589 --> 00:46:29,599
bigger satellites or smaller satellites
 

2563
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:31,670
bigger satellites or smaller satellites
is there going to be a mix like what's

2564
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:31,680
is there going to be a mix like what's
 

2565
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,030
is there going to be a mix like what's
and what do we talk what what does it

2566
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:33,040
and what do we talk what what does it
 

2567
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:33,589
and what do we talk what what does it
mean

2568
00:46:33,589 --> 00:46:33,599
mean
 

2569
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:36,069
mean
for satellite to be big most and small

2570
00:46:36,069 --> 00:46:36,079
for satellite to be big most and small
 

2571
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:36,790
for satellite to be big most and small
what's that so

2572
00:46:36,790 --> 00:46:36,800
what's that so
 

2573
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:40,069
what's that so
big the space industry

2574
00:46:40,069 --> 00:46:40,079
big the space industry
 

2575
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:43,990
big the space industry
prior to i don't know 1990

2576
00:46:43,990 --> 00:46:44,000
prior to i don't know 1990
 

2577
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,510
prior to i don't know 1990
you know i guess the bulk of the

2578
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:45,520
you know i guess the bulk of the
 

2579
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,270
you know i guess the bulk of the
majority of satellites were

2580
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:47,280
majority of satellites were
 

2581
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:50,550
majority of satellites were
the size of a school bus and cost

2582
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:50,560
the size of a school bus and cost
 

2583
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:54,710
the size of a school bus and cost
a couple billion dollars and now

2584
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:54,720
a couple billion dollars and now
 

2585
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:58,870
a couple billion dollars and now
you know our first launches were on

2586
00:46:58,870 --> 00:46:58,880
you know our first launches were on
 

2587
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,109
you know our first launches were on
um satellites the size of shoe boxes

2588
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:01,119
um satellites the size of shoe boxes
 

2589
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,950
um satellites the size of shoe boxes
that were built by high school students

2590
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:02,960
that were built by high school students
 

2591
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,790
that were built by high school students
so that's a very different

2592
00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:04,800
so that's a very different
 

2593
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,550
so that's a very different
you know to give you the two ends of the

2594
00:47:06,550 --> 00:47:06,560
you know to give you the two ends of the
 

2595
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:08,630
you know to give you the two ends of the
spectrum

2596
00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:08,640
spectrum
 

2597
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:11,589
spectrum
big satellites will i think they're here

2598
00:47:11,589 --> 00:47:11,599
big satellites will i think they're here
 

2599
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:12,790
big satellites will i think they're here
to stay at least

2600
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:12,800
to stay at least
 

2601
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,510
to stay at least
as far as i can see into the future um

2602
00:47:15,510 --> 00:47:15,520
as far as i can see into the future um
 

2603
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:16,430
as far as i can see into the future um
for things like

2604
00:47:16,430 --> 00:47:16,440
for things like
 

2605
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:20,710
for things like
broadcasting um you want to be able to

2606
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:20,720
broadcasting um you want to be able to
 

2607
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:23,030
broadcasting um you want to be able to
you know broadcast to as many people as

2608
00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:23,040
you know broadcast to as many people as
 

2609
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,069
you know broadcast to as many people as
possible

2610
00:47:24,069 --> 00:47:24,079
possible
 

2611
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:27,829
possible
um there you also can't just go to small

2612
00:47:27,829 --> 00:47:27,839
um there you also can't just go to small
 

2613
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:29,109
um there you also can't just go to small
satellites

2614
00:47:29,109 --> 00:47:29,119
satellites
 

2615
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:31,030
satellites
and say moore's law for things like

2616
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:31,040
and say moore's law for things like
 

2617
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,790
and say moore's law for things like
optics so if you have an

2618
00:47:32,790 --> 00:47:32,800
optics so if you have an
 

2619
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,549
optics so if you have an
an aperture on your satellite you know

2620
00:47:34,549 --> 00:47:34,559
an aperture on your satellite you know
 

2621
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:36,549
an aperture on your satellite you know
that just that doesn't follow morris law

2622
00:47:36,549 --> 00:47:36,559
that just that doesn't follow morris law
 

2623
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:36,950
that just that doesn't follow morris law
that's

2624
00:47:36,950 --> 00:47:36,960
that's
 

2625
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,470
that's
that's different so it's always going to

2626
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:38,480
that's different so it's always going to
 

2627
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,069
that's different so it's always going to
be the size it it will be

2628
00:47:40,069 --> 00:47:40,079
be the size it it will be
 

2629
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:41,910
be the size it it will be
you know unless there's some new physics

2630
00:47:41,910 --> 00:47:41,920
you know unless there's some new physics
 

2631
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:44,069
you know unless there's some new physics
that comes out that i'm not aware of

2632
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:44,079
that comes out that i'm not aware of
 

2633
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:45,670
that comes out that i'm not aware of
but if you need a resolution and you're

2634
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:45,680
but if you need a resolution and you're
 

2635
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,910
but if you need a resolution and you're
at an altitude that kind of sets your

2636
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:47,920
at an altitude that kind of sets your
 

2637
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:51,430
at an altitude that kind of sets your
size of your telescope but

2638
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:51,440
size of your telescope but
 

2639
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,990
size of your telescope but
because of moore's law we we are able to

2640
00:47:53,990 --> 00:47:54,000
because of moore's law we we are able to
 

2641
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:54,549
because of moore's law we we are able to
do

2642
00:47:54,549 --> 00:47:54,559
do
 

2643
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:57,190
do
a lot more with smaller packages and and

2644
00:47:57,190 --> 00:47:57,200
a lot more with smaller packages and and
 

2645
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,390
a lot more with smaller packages and and
with that

2646
00:47:58,390 --> 00:47:58,400
with that
 

2647
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,390
with that
you know comes more affordability and

2648
00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:00,400
you know comes more affordability and
 

2649
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,549
you know comes more affordability and
opening up access to space to more and

2650
00:48:02,549 --> 00:48:02,559
opening up access to space to more and
 

2651
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:03,589
opening up access to space to more and
more people

2652
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:03,599
more people
 

2653
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:04,950
more people
well what's the smallest satellite

2654
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:04,960
well what's the smallest satellite
 

2655
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,950
well what's the smallest satellite
you've seen go up there like what

2656
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:06,960
you've seen go up there like what
 

2657
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,630
you've seen go up there like what
what are the smallest kind you said shoe

2658
00:48:08,630 --> 00:48:08,640
what are the smallest kind you said shoe
 

2659
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:09,990
what are the smallest kind you said shoe
boxes yeah so

2660
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:10,000
boxes yeah so
 

2661
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,790
boxes yeah so
i think you know the smallest their uh

2662
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:12,800
i think you know the smallest their uh
 

2663
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:13,510
i think you know the smallest their uh
smallest

2664
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:13,520
smallest
 

2665
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,910
smallest
common form factor can fit a softball

2666
00:48:15,910 --> 00:48:15,920
common form factor can fit a softball
 

2667
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:16,790
common form factor can fit a softball
inside

2668
00:48:16,790 --> 00:48:16,800
inside
 

2669
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,990
inside
wow so that's 10 centimeters on each

2670
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:20,000
wow so that's 10 centimeters on each
 

2671
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,230
wow so that's 10 centimeters on each
side um but then there are some

2672
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:22,240
side um but then there are some
 

2673
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,069
side um but then there are some
companies working on

2674
00:48:24,069 --> 00:48:24,079
companies working on
 

2675
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:26,309
companies working on
you know fractions of that even and

2676
00:48:26,309 --> 00:48:26,319
you know fractions of that even and
 

2677
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:28,390
you know fractions of that even and
they're doing things like

2678
00:48:28,390 --> 00:48:28,400
they're doing things like
 

2679
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:31,430
they're doing things like
iot type application so it's very low

2680
00:48:31,430 --> 00:48:31,440
iot type application so it's very low
 

2681
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34,470
iot type application so it's very low
you know bandwidth type things but

2682
00:48:34,470 --> 00:48:34,480
you know bandwidth type things but
 

2683
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:35,589
you know bandwidth type things but
they're finding some

2684
00:48:35,589 --> 00:48:35,599
they're finding some
 

2685
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:37,990
they're finding some
niches for those you mean like there's a

2686
00:48:37,990 --> 00:48:38,000
niches for those you mean like there's a
 

2687
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,309
niches for those you mean like there's a
business there's a thing to do with them

2688
00:48:40,309 --> 00:48:40,319
business there's a thing to do with them
 

2689
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:42,230
business there's a thing to do with them
yes what do you do with a small

2690
00:48:42,230 --> 00:48:42,240
yes what do you do with a small
 

2691
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,430
yes what do you do with a small
satellite like that

2692
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:43,440
satellite like that
 

2693
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:47,030
satellite like that
um you can you know track a ship going

2694
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:47,040
um you can you know track a ship going
 

2695
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:47,990
um you can you know track a ship going
across the ocean

2696
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:48,000
across the ocean
 

2697
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,829
across the ocean
is like if you need to if you're just

2698
00:48:49,829 --> 00:48:49,839
is like if you need to if you're just
 

2699
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:51,270
is like if you need to if you're just
pinging something you know you can

2700
00:48:51,270 --> 00:48:51,280
pinging something you know you can
 

2701
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:52,150
pinging something you know you can
handle that

2702
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:52,160
handle that
 

2703
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,630
handle that
that amount of data um and those

2704
00:48:54,630 --> 00:48:54,640
that amount of data um and those
 

2705
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:55,990
that amount of data um and those
latencies and

2706
00:48:55,990 --> 00:48:56,000
latencies and
 

2707
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,349
latencies and
you have to have propulsion on that you

2708
00:48:57,349 --> 00:48:57,359
you have to have propulsion on that you
 

2709
00:48:57,359 --> 00:48:59,030
you have to have propulsion on that you
have to have a little engine no

2710
00:48:59,030 --> 00:48:59,040
have to have a little engine no
 

2711
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,109
have to have a little engine no
those are just you know letting fall out

2712
00:49:01,109 --> 00:49:01,119
those are just you know letting fall out
 

2713
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:02,549
those are just you know letting fall out
of the sky

2714
00:49:02,549 --> 00:49:02,559
of the sky
 

2715
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:05,349
of the sky
um okay yeah but what uh so what kind of

2716
00:49:05,349 --> 00:49:05,359
um okay yeah but what uh so what kind of
 

2717
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:05,829
um okay yeah but what uh so what kind of
solid

2718
00:49:05,829 --> 00:49:05,839
solid
 

2719
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:08,309
solid
lights would you equip a colloid engine

2720
00:49:08,309 --> 00:49:08,319
lights would you equip a colloid engine
 

2721
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:10,549
lights would you equip a colloid engine
on anything that's bigger than

2722
00:49:10,549 --> 00:49:10,559
on anything that's bigger than
 

2723
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:13,270
on anything that's bigger than
probably about 20 kilograms anything

2724
00:49:13,270 --> 00:49:13,280
probably about 20 kilograms anything
 

2725
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:15,430
probably about 20 kilograms anything
that needs to stay up for more than

2726
00:49:15,430 --> 00:49:15,440
that needs to stay up for more than
 

2727
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:18,470
that needs to stay up for more than
a year or anything somebody spent more

2728
00:49:18,470 --> 00:49:18,480
a year or anything somebody spent more
 

2729
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,710
a year or anything somebody spent more
than like 100k to build are kind of the

2730
00:49:20,710 --> 00:49:20,720
than like 100k to build are kind of the
 

2731
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:21,829
than like 100k to build are kind of the
ways i would think about it

2732
00:49:21,829 --> 00:49:21,839
ways i would think about it
 

2733
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:24,150
ways i would think about it
that's a lot of use cases what's this

2734
00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:24,160
that's a lot of use cases what's this
 

2735
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,829
that's a lot of use cases what's this
what's the small set

2736
00:49:25,829 --> 00:49:25,839
what's the small set
 

2737
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:27,750
what's the small set
like what what's category it's actually

2738
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:27,760
like what what's category it's actually
 

2739
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,510
like what what's category it's actually
very big i think it's like

2740
00:49:29,510 --> 00:49:29,520
very big i think it's like
 

2741
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,390
very big i think it's like
700 kilograms or keep hitting my

2742
00:49:32,390 --> 00:49:32,400
700 kilograms or keep hitting my
 

2743
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:33,109
700 kilograms or keep hitting my
microphone

2744
00:49:33,109 --> 00:49:33,119
microphone
 

2745
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:37,510
microphone
um maybe a thousand kilograms down to

2746
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:37,520
um maybe a thousand kilograms down to
 

2747
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:40,549
um maybe a thousand kilograms down to
200 kilograms or people

2748
00:49:40,549 --> 00:49:40,559
200 kilograms or people
 

2749
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:42,309
200 kilograms or people
have their own kind of definitions of

2750
00:49:42,309 --> 00:49:42,319
have their own kind of definitions of
 

2751
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:43,990
have their own kind of definitions of
how they break them up but small

2752
00:49:43,990 --> 00:49:44,000
how they break them up but small
 

2753
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,589
how they break them up but small
sat is still quite large and then um

2754
00:49:47,589 --> 00:49:47,599
sat is still quite large and then um
 

2755
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:49,430
sat is still quite large and then um
it's kind of also applied as a blanket

2756
00:49:49,430 --> 00:49:49,440
it's kind of also applied as a blanket
 

2757
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,109
it's kind of also applied as a blanket
term for anything that's not a school

2758
00:49:51,109 --> 00:49:51,119
term for anything that's not a school
 

2759
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:52,710
term for anything that's not a school
bus size satellite

2760
00:49:52,710 --> 00:49:52,720
bus size satellite
 

2761
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:55,030
bus size satellite
so we need to get our jargon straight

2762
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:55,040
so we need to get our jargon straight
 

2763
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,230
so we need to get our jargon straight
industry

2764
00:49:56,230 --> 00:49:56,240
industry
 

2765
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,630
industry
so what do you see do you see a possible

2766
00:49:58,630 --> 00:49:58,640
so what do you see do you see a possible
 

2767
00:49:58,640 --> 00:49:59,990
so what do you see do you see a possible
future where

2768
00:49:59,990 --> 00:50:00,000
future where
 

2769
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,190
future where
you know there's a few thousand

2770
00:50:01,190 --> 00:50:01,200
you know there's a few thousand
 

2771
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,950
you know there's a few thousand
satellites up there now a couple of

2772
00:50:02,950 --> 00:50:02,960
satellites up there now a couple of
 

2773
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:03,670
satellites up there now a couple of
thousands of them

2774
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:03,680
thousands of them
 

2775
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:06,309
thousands of them
functioning do you see a future where

2776
00:50:06,309 --> 00:50:06,319
functioning do you see a future where
 

2777
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:08,630
functioning do you see a future where
there's like millions of satellites up

2778
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:08,640
there's like millions of satellites up
 

2779
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:11,190
there's like millions of satellites up
up in orbit or if we get millions tens

2780
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:11,200
up in orbit or if we get millions tens
 

2781
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,870
up in orbit or if we get millions tens
of thousands

2782
00:50:12,870 --> 00:50:12,880
of thousands
 

2783
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,510
of thousands
which just seems like where the natural

2784
00:50:15,510 --> 00:50:15,520
which just seems like where the natural
 

2785
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,589
which just seems like where the natural
trajectory of the way

2786
00:50:17,589 --> 00:50:17,599
trajectory of the way
 

2787
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:20,470
trajectory of the way
things are going now is going tens of

2788
00:50:20,470 --> 00:50:20,480
things are going now is going tens of
 

2789
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:21,670
things are going now is going tens of
thousands yes

2790
00:50:21,670 --> 00:50:21,680
thousands yes
 

2791
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:25,430
thousands yes
uh the two you know buckets of

2792
00:50:25,430 --> 00:50:25,440
uh the two you know buckets of
 

2793
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:26,870
uh the two you know buckets of
applications one is

2794
00:50:26,870 --> 00:50:26,880
applications one is
 

2795
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:30,309
applications one is
imaging and the other is communication

2796
00:50:30,309 --> 00:50:30,319
imaging and the other is communication
 

2797
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:33,589
imaging and the other is communication
so imaging uh i think that will

2798
00:50:33,589 --> 00:50:33,599
so imaging uh i think that will
 

2799
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:37,109
so imaging uh i think that will
plateau because one

2800
00:50:37,109 --> 00:50:37,119
plateau because one
 

2801
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:39,430
plateau because one
satellite or one constellation can take

2802
00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:39,440
satellite or one constellation can take
 

2803
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,510
satellite or one constellation can take
an image or a video and sell it to

2804
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:41,520
an image or a video and sell it to
 

2805
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:44,549
an image or a video and sell it to
you know infinity customers but if

2806
00:50:44,549 --> 00:50:44,559
you know infinity customers but if
 

2807
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:45,670
you know infinity customers but if
you're

2808
00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:45,680
you're
 

2809
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:48,710
you're
providing communications like broadband

2810
00:50:48,710 --> 00:50:48,720
providing communications like broadband
 

2811
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:51,910
providing communications like broadband
internet or satellite cell or something

2812
00:50:51,910 --> 00:50:51,920
internet or satellite cell or something
 

2813
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:52,470
internet or satellite cell or something
like that

2814
00:50:52,470 --> 00:50:52,480
like that
 

2815
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,870
like that
satellite phone um you know you're

2816
00:50:54,870 --> 00:50:54,880
satellite phone um you know you're
 

2817
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,470
satellite phone um you know you're
you're limited by your

2818
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:56,480
you're limited by your
 

2819
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:59,430
you're limited by your
transponders and and so on so to serve

2820
00:50:59,430 --> 00:50:59,440
transponders and and so on so to serve
 

2821
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:01,270
transponders and and so on so to serve
more people you actually need more

2822
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:01,280
more people you actually need more
 

2823
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:04,630
more people you actually need more
satellites and and perhaps at the rate

2824
00:51:04,630 --> 00:51:04,640
satellites and and perhaps at the rate
 

2825
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,309
satellites and and perhaps at the rate
you know our data consumption

2826
00:51:06,309 --> 00:51:06,319
you know our data consumption
 

2827
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:08,870
you know our data consumption
and things are going these days um yeah

2828
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:08,880
and things are going these days um yeah
 

2829
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,309
and things are going these days um yeah
i can see tens of thousands of

2830
00:51:10,309 --> 00:51:10,319
i can see tens of thousands of
 

2831
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:12,470
i can see tens of thousands of

can i ask you a ridiculous question yes

2834
00:51:15,270 --> 00:51:15,280
can i ask you a ridiculous question yes
 

2835

00:51:20,470 --> 00:51:20,480
about
 

2841
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:23,349
about
flat earthers that bel you know the

2842
00:51:23,349 --> 00:51:23,359
flat earthers that bel you know the
 

2843
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:25,750
flat earthers that bel you know the
people that believe in a flat earth

2844
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:25,760
people that believe in a flat earth
 

2845
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:28,309
people that believe in a flat earth
as somebody as somebody who develops

spacecraft
 

2853
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,790
spacecraft
what's uh to use the most convincing

2854
00:51:36,790 --> 00:51:36,800
what's uh to use the most convincing
 

2855
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:37,430
what's uh to use the most convincing
evidence

2856
00:51:37,430 --> 00:51:37,440
evidence
 

2857
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:40,630
evidence
that the earth is around

2858
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:40,640

 

2859
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:45,109

probably some of the

2860
00:51:45,109 --> 00:51:45,119

 

2861
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:48,630

photos taken from the moon

00:51:48,630 --> 00:51:48,640
photos taken from the moon
 

2863
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,950
photos taken from the moon
photos on the moon okay so it's not from

2864
00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:50,960
photos on the moon okay so it's not from
 

2865
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:53,030
photos on the moon okay so it's not from
from the satellite space

2866
00:51:53,030 --> 00:51:53,040
from the satellite space
 

2867
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,549
from the satellite space
yeah i think seeing though that

2868
00:51:54,549 --> 00:51:54,559
yeah i think seeing though that
 

2869
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:56,870
yeah i think seeing though that
perspective

2870
00:51:56,870 --> 00:51:56,880
perspective
 

2871
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,750
perspective
i maybe i'm just i'm answering to

2872
00:51:59,750 --> 00:51:59,760
i maybe i'm just i'm answering to
 

2873
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,270
i maybe i'm just i'm answering to
personally because i really

2874
00:52:01,270 --> 00:52:01,280
personally because i really
 

2875
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,910
personally because i really
love those photos they're beautiful yeah

2876
00:52:03,910 --> 00:52:03,920
love those photos they're beautiful yeah
 

2877
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,750
love those photos they're beautiful yeah
i really like the ones that show the

2878
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:05,760
i really like the ones that show the
 

2879
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:06,390
i really like the ones that show the
moon

2880
00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:06,400
moon
 

2881
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,870
moon
and um the lunar lander and they're

2882
00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:08,880
and um the lunar lander and they're
 

2883
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:09,750
and um the lunar lander and they're
taken

2884
00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:09,760
taken
 

2885
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:12,069
taken
a little bit farther back so you see

2886
00:52:12,069 --> 00:52:12,079
a little bit farther back so you see
 

2887
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:13,670
a little bit farther back so you see
earth and first you're like wow that's

2888
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:13,680
earth and first you're like wow that's
 

2889
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,109
earth and first you're like wow that's
tiny and we're

2890
00:52:15,109 --> 00:52:15,119
tiny and we're
 

2891
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:17,750
tiny and we're
insignificant and that's kind of sad but

2892
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:17,760
insignificant and that's kind of sad but
 

2893
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:18,630
insignificant and that's kind of sad but
then you see

2894
00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:18,640
then you see
 

2895
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:20,390
then you see
this really cool thing that we landed on

2896
00:52:20,390 --> 00:52:20,400
this really cool thing that we landed on
 

2897
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:21,910
this really cool thing that we landed on
another

2898
00:52:21,910 --> 00:52:21,920
another
 

2899
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:24,069
another
you know planetary body and you're like

2900
00:52:24,069 --> 00:52:24,079
you know planetary body and you're like
 

2901
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:26,390
you know planetary body and you're like
oh okay can you actually see her i i

2902
00:52:26,390 --> 00:52:26,400
oh okay can you actually see her i i
 

2903
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:27,990
oh okay can you actually see her i i
don't i don't know yeah i'll send you

2904
00:52:27,990 --> 00:52:28,000
don't i don't know yeah i'll send you
 

2905
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,270
don't i don't know yeah i'll send you
i'll send you that picture because i

2906
00:52:29,270 --> 00:52:29,280
i'll send you that picture because i
 

2907
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:30,309
i'll send you that picture because i
love the pictures

2908
00:52:30,309 --> 00:52:30,319
love the pictures
 

2909
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:33,109
love the pictures
or videos of just earth from more from

2910
00:52:33,109 --> 00:52:33,119
or videos of just earth from more from
 

2911
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:33,990
or videos of just earth from more from
orbit and so on

2912
00:52:33,990 --> 00:52:34,000
orbit and so on
 

2913
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,069
orbit and so on
right yeah those that's really beautiful

2914
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:36,079
right yeah those that's really beautiful
 

2915
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:37,910
right yeah those that's really beautiful
that's like a perspective shifter

2916
00:52:37,910 --> 00:52:37,920
that's like a perspective shifter
 

2917
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,829
that's like a perspective shifter
that's the pale blue dot right it

2918
00:52:39,829 --> 00:52:39,839
that's the pale blue dot right it
 

2919
00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:41,349
that's the pale blue dot right it
probably appears tiny

2920
00:52:41,349 --> 00:52:41,359
probably appears tiny
 

2921
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:43,309
probably appears tiny
yeah and just that you know

2922
00:52:43,309 --> 00:52:43,319
yeah and just that you know
 

2923
00:52:43,319 --> 00:52:44,870
yeah and just that you know
juxtaposition of

2924
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:44,880
juxtaposition of
 

2925
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:47,030
juxtaposition of
the insignificance but you're not going

2926
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:47,040
the insignificance but you're not going
 

2927
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:49,109
the insignificance but you're not going
to build this really cool thing

2928
00:52:49,109 --> 00:52:49,119
to build this really cool thing
 

2929
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:51,349
to build this really cool thing
i just love that yeah that'd be cool i

2930
00:52:51,349 --> 00:52:51,359
i just love that yeah that'd be cool i
 

2931
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:52,950
i just love that yeah that'd be cool i
can't i personally love the idea of

2932
00:52:52,950 --> 00:52:52,960
can't i personally love the idea of
 

2933
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,870
can't i personally love the idea of
humans stepping out of mars i'm such a

2934
00:52:54,870 --> 00:52:54,880
humans stepping out of mars i'm such a
 

2935
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:57,270
humans stepping out of mars i'm such a
sucker for the romantic notion of

2936
00:52:57,270 --> 00:52:57,280
sucker for the romantic notion of
 

2937

you said
 

2947
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:09,750
you said
you wouldn't be not in the first

2948
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:09,760
you wouldn't be not in the first
 

2949
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,670
you wouldn't be not in the first
thousand

2950
00:53:11,670 --> 00:53:11,680
thousand
 

2951
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:14,630
thousand
which it's funny because to me that's

2952
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:14,640
which it's funny because to me that's
 

2953
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:17,030
which it's funny because to me that's
that's brave to be in the first million

2954
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:17,040
that's brave to be in the first million
 

2955
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:20,470
that's brave to be in the first million
i think when the declaration of

2956
00:53:20,470 --> 00:53:20,480
i think when the declaration of
 

2957
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:21,670
i think when the declaration of
independence was signed

2958
00:53:21,670 --> 00:53:21,680
independence was signed
 

2959
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:24,069
independence was signed
in the united states that was like two

2960
00:53:24,069 --> 00:53:24,079
in the united states that was like two
 

2961
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:25,510
in the united states that was like two
million people

2962
00:53:25,510 --> 00:53:25,520
million people
 

2963
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:27,430
million people
so i would like to show up when they're

2964
00:53:27,430 --> 00:53:27,440
so i would like to show up when they're
 

2965
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,030
so i would like to show up when they're
signing those documents

2966
00:53:29,030 --> 00:53:29,040
signing those documents
 

2967
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,270
signing those documents
okay so maybe the two million oh that's

2968
00:53:31,270 --> 00:53:31,280
okay so maybe the two million oh that's
 

2969
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:32,710
okay so maybe the two million oh that's
an interesting way to think about it

2970
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:32,720
an interesting way to think about it
 

2971
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:34,150
an interesting way to think about it
because like then we're like

2972
00:53:34,150 --> 00:53:34,160
because like then we're like
 

2973
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:36,470
because like then we're like
participating as citizenry and defining

2974
00:53:36,470 --> 00:53:36,480
participating as citizenry and defining
 

2975
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:36,870
participating as citizenry and defining
the

2976
00:53:36,870 --> 00:53:36,880
the
 

2977
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:40,390
the
direction so it's not the technical

2978
00:53:40,390 --> 00:53:40,400
direction so it's not the technical
 

2979
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,630
direction so it's not the technical
risk you just don't want to show up

2980
00:53:42,630 --> 00:53:42,640
risk you just don't want to show up
 

2981
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:44,150
risk you just don't want to show up
somewhere that's

2982
00:53:44,150 --> 00:53:44,160
somewhere that's
 

2983
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:47,510
somewhere that's
like america before yeah

2984
00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:47,520
like america before yeah
 

2985
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:50,470
like america before yeah
because it's i from a psychological

2986
00:53:50,470 --> 00:53:50,480
because it's i from a psychological
 

2987
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:51,430
because it's i from a psychological
perspective

2988
00:53:51,430 --> 00:53:51,440
perspective
 

2989
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:53,990
perspective
it's just going to be a stressful mess

2990
00:53:53,990 --> 00:53:54,000
it's just going to be a stressful mess
 

2991
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,270
it's just going to be a stressful mess
as people have

2992
00:53:55,270 --> 00:53:55,280
as people have
 

2993
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:58,549
as people have
studied right it's like it's

2994
00:53:58,549 --> 00:53:58,559
studied right it's like it's
 

2995
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:02,069
studied right it's like it's
people most likely the process of

2996
00:54:02,069 --> 00:54:02,079
people most likely the process of
 

2997
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:04,069
people most likely the process of
colonization

2998
00:54:04,069 --> 00:54:04,079
colonization
 

2999
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:07,109
colonization
like looks like basically a prison

3000
00:54:07,109 --> 00:54:07,119
like looks like basically a prison
 

3001
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:09,270
like looks like basically a prison
like you're in a very tight enclosed

3002
00:54:09,270 --> 00:54:09,280
like you're in a very tight enclosed
 

3003
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:10,470
like you're in a very tight enclosed
space with people

3004
00:54:10,470 --> 00:54:10,480
space with people
 

3005
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,990
space with people
and it's just a really stressful

3006
00:54:11,990 --> 00:54:12,000
and it's just a really stressful
 

3007
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,510
and it's just a really stressful
environment you know

3008
00:54:13,510 --> 00:54:13,520
environment you know
 

3009
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:14,710
environment you know
how do you select the kind of people

3010
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:14,720
how do you select the kind of people
 

3011
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,390
how do you select the kind of people
that will go and then there'll be drama

3012
00:54:16,390 --> 00:54:16,400
that will go and then there'll be drama
 

3013
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,069
that will go and then there'll be drama
there's always drama

3014
00:54:18,069 --> 00:54:18,079
there's always drama
 

3015
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:19,829
there's always drama
and i just want to show up when there's

3016
00:54:19,829 --> 00:54:19,839
and i just want to show up when there's
 

3017
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:21,190
and i just want to show up when there's
some rules

3018
00:54:21,190 --> 00:54:21,200
some rules
 

3019
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:23,030
some rules
but i mean you know it depends so i'm

3020
00:54:23,030 --> 00:54:23,040
but i mean you know it depends so i'm
 

3021
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:24,230
but i mean you know it depends so i'm
not worried about the health

3022
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:24,240
not worried about the health
 

3023
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:26,069
not worried about the health
and the technical difficulties yeah i'm

3024
00:54:26,069 --> 00:54:26,079
and the technical difficulties yeah i'm
 

3025
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:27,349
and the technical difficulties yeah i'm
more worried about the

3026
00:54:27,349 --> 00:54:27,359
more worried about the
 

3027
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:30,150
more worried about the
psychological difficulties and also just

3028
00:54:30,150 --> 00:54:30,160
psychological difficulties and also just
 

3029
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:31,589
psychological difficulties and also just
not being able to tweet like what are

3030
00:54:31,589 --> 00:54:31,599
not being able to tweet like what are
 

3031
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:32,150
not being able to tweet like what are
you gonna

3032
00:54:32,150 --> 00:54:32,160
you gonna
 

3033
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:35,349
you gonna
how are you yeah there's no netflix so

3034
00:54:35,349 --> 00:54:35,359
how are you yeah there's no netflix so
 

3035
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:37,349
how are you yeah there's no netflix so
yeah maybe not in the first million but

3036
00:54:37,349 --> 00:54:37,359
yeah maybe not in the first million but
 

3037
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:38,950
yeah maybe not in the first million but
the first hundred uh

3038
00:54:38,950 --> 00:54:38,960
the first hundred uh
 

3039
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:41,270
the first hundred uh
thousand it's exciting to define the

3040
00:54:41,270 --> 00:54:41,280
thousand it's exciting to define the
 

3041
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,470
thousand it's exciting to define the
direction of a new

3042
00:54:42,470 --> 00:54:42,480
direction of a new
 

3043
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:45,349
direction of a new
like how often do we not just have a

3044
00:54:45,349 --> 00:54:45,359
like how often do we not just have a
 

3045
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:47,990
like how often do we not just have a
revolution to redefine our government

3046
00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:48,000
revolution to redefine our government
 

3047
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,910
revolution to redefine our government
as you know smaller countries are still

3048
00:54:49,910 --> 00:54:49,920
as you know smaller countries are still
 

3049
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,069
as you know smaller countries are still
doing to this day

3050
00:54:52,069 --> 00:54:52,079
doing to this day
 

3051
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:55,270
doing to this day
start over from scratch there's uh

3052
00:54:55,270 --> 00:54:55,280
start over from scratch there's uh
 

3053
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:57,109
start over from scratch there's uh
just our financial system it could be

3054
00:54:57,109 --> 00:54:57,119
just our financial system it could be
 

3055
00:54:57,119 --> 00:54:59,589
just our financial system it could be
like based on cryptocurrency

3056
00:54:59,589 --> 00:54:59,599
like based on cryptocurrency
 

3057
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:01,750
like based on cryptocurrency
you could think about like how democrat

3058
00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:01,760
you could think about like how democrat
 

3059
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:02,950
you could think about like how democrat
you know we have

3060
00:55:02,950 --> 00:55:02,960
you know we have
 

3061
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:05,430
you know we have
we have now the technology that can

3062
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:05,440
we have now the technology that can
 

3063
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:07,510
we have now the technology that can
enable pure democracy for example

3064
00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:07,520
enable pure democracy for example
 

3065
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:10,150
enable pure democracy for example
if we choose to do that yeah as opposed

3066
00:55:10,150 --> 00:55:10,160
if we choose to do that yeah as opposed
 

3067
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:11,750
if we choose to do that yeah as opposed
to representative democracy all those

3068
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:11,760
to representative democracy all those
 

3069
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:12,630
to representative democracy all those
kinds of things

3070
00:55:12,630 --> 00:55:12,640
kinds of things
 

3071
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:15,430
kinds of things
so we talked about two uh different

3072
00:55:15,430 --> 00:55:15,440
so we talked about two uh different
 

3073
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,030
so we talked about two uh different
forms of propulsion which are

3074
00:55:17,030 --> 00:55:17,040
forms of propulsion which are
 

3075
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,430
forms of propulsion which are
super exciting so the chemical based

3076
00:55:19,430 --> 00:55:19,440
super exciting so the chemical based
 

3077
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:21,430
super exciting so the chemical based
that's doing pretty well and then the

3078
00:55:21,430 --> 00:55:21,440
that's doing pretty well and then the
 

3079
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:25,349
that's doing pretty well and then the
electric base is um are there types of

3080
00:55:25,349 --> 00:55:25,359
electric base is um are there types of
 

3081
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:26,789
electric base is um are there types of
propulsion

3082
00:55:26,789 --> 00:55:26,799
propulsion
 

3083
00:55:26,799 --> 00:55:28,549
propulsion
that might sound like science fiction

3084
00:55:28,549 --> 00:55:28,559
that might sound like science fiction
 

3085
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:30,309
that might sound like science fiction
right now but are actually within the

3086
00:55:30,309 --> 00:55:30,319
right now but are actually within the
 

3087
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:32,230
right now but are actually within the
reach of science in the next

3088
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:32,240
reach of science in the next
 

3089
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:35,030
reach of science in the next
10 20 30 50 years that you kind of think

3090
00:55:35,030 --> 00:55:35,040
10 20 30 50 years that you kind of think
 

3091
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:35,750
10 20 30 50 years that you kind of think
about

3092
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:35,760
about
 

3093
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:38,230
about
or maybe even within the space of even

3094
00:55:38,230 --> 00:55:38,240
or maybe even within the space of even
 

3095
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:41,270
or maybe even within the space of even
just like

3096
00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:41,280

 

3097
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:44,390

like even ion engines is there like

3098
00:55:44,390 --> 00:55:44,400
like even ion engines is there like
 

3099
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,549
like even ion engines is there like
breakthroughs that might 10x the thing

3100
00:55:46,549 --> 00:55:46,559
breakthroughs that might 10x the thing
 

3101
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:47,990
breakthroughs that might 10x the thing
like really improve

3102
00:55:47,990 --> 00:55:48,000
like really improve
 

3103
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,750
like really improve
it so you know the real game changer

3104
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:51,760
it so you know the real game changer
 

3105
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:52,829
it so you know the real game changer
would be

3106
00:55:52,829 --> 00:55:52,839
would be
 

3107
00:55:52,839 --> 00:55:55,990
would be
propellant-less propulsion and so

3108
00:55:55,990 --> 00:55:56,000
propellant-less propulsion and so
 

3109
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,270
propellant-less propulsion and so
every couple years you see a new now a

3110
00:55:59,270 --> 00:55:59,280
every couple years you see a new now a
 

3111
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:00,710
every couple years you see a new now a
startup or

3112
00:56:00,710 --> 00:56:00,720
startup or
 

3113
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:03,190
startup or
a researcher comes up with some

3114
00:56:03,190 --> 00:56:03,200
a researcher comes up with some
 

3115
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:04,150
a researcher comes up with some
contraption

3116
00:56:04,150 --> 00:56:04,160
contraption
 

3117
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:07,030
contraption
for producing thrust that didn't require

3118
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:07,040
for producing thrust that didn't require
 

3119
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:07,990
for producing thrust that didn't require
you know we've been talking about

3120
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:08,000
you know we've been talking about
 

3121
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,589
you know we've been talking about
conservation of momentum

3122
00:56:09,589 --> 00:56:09,599
conservation of momentum
 

3123
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:13,829
conservation of momentum
mass times velocity out the back um

3124
00:56:13,829 --> 00:56:13,839
mass times velocity out the back um
 

3125
00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:18,230
mass times velocity out the back um
forward yes exactly and you have to

3126
00:56:18,230 --> 00:56:18,240
forward yes exactly and you have to
 

3127
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:19,990
forward yes exactly and you have to
you know carry that up with you or find

3128
00:56:19,990 --> 00:56:20,000
you know carry that up with you or find
 

3129
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,309
you know carry that up with you or find
it on an asteroid or harvest it from

3130
00:56:22,309 --> 00:56:22,319
it on an asteroid or harvest it from
 

3131
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:23,670
it on an asteroid or harvest it from
somewhere if you didn't bring it with

3132
00:56:23,670 --> 00:56:23,680
somewhere if you didn't bring it with
 

3133
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:24,470
somewhere if you didn't bring it with
you so

3134
00:56:24,470 --> 00:56:24,480
you so
 

3135
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:26,950
you so
not having to do that would be you know

3136
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:26,960
not having to do that would be you know
 

3137
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:28,390
not having to do that would be you know
one of the ultimate

3138
00:56:28,390 --> 00:56:28,400
one of the ultimate
 

3139
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:31,510
one of the ultimate
game changers um and and i

3140
00:56:31,510 --> 00:56:31,520
game changers um and and i
 

3141
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:34,870
game changers um and and i
you know unless there are new types of

3142
00:56:34,870 --> 00:56:34,880
you know unless there are new types of
 

3143
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:35,670
you know unless there are new types of
physics

3144
00:56:35,670 --> 00:56:35,680
physics
 

3145
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:37,990
physics
um i don't know how we do it but it

3146
00:56:37,990 --> 00:56:38,000
um i don't know how we do it but it
 

3147
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,829
um i don't know how we do it but it
comes up often so it's something i

3148
00:56:39,829 --> 00:56:39,839
comes up often so it's something i
 

3149
00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:42,630
comes up often so it's something i
i do think about and um you know the one

3150
00:56:42,630 --> 00:56:42,640
i do think about and um you know the one
 

3151
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:43,990
i do think about and um you know the one
i think it's called the casmir

3152
00:56:43,990 --> 00:56:44,000
i think it's called the casmir
 

3153
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,030
i think it's called the casmir
effect um if you can if you have two

3154
00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:47,040
effect um if you can if you have two
 

3155
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:47,829
effect um if you can if you have two
plates and

3156
00:56:47,829 --> 00:56:47,839
plates and
 

3157
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:49,589
plates and
and the space between them is on the

3158
00:56:49,589 --> 00:56:49,599
and the space between them is on the
 

3159
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:51,190
and the space between them is on the
order of these like

3160
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:51,200
order of these like
 

3161
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,910
order of these like
the wavelength of these ephemeral vacuum

3162
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:53,920
the wavelength of these ephemeral vacuum
 

3163
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,030
the wavelength of these ephemeral vacuum
particles that pop

3164
00:56:55,030 --> 00:56:55,040
particles that pop
 

3165
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:57,270
particles that pop
into and out of existence or something

3166
00:56:57,270 --> 00:56:57,280
into and out of existence or something
 

3167
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:58,630
into and out of existence or something
um

3168
00:56:58,630 --> 00:56:58,640
um
 

3169
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:00,870
um
i may be confusing multiple types of

3170
00:57:00,870 --> 00:57:00,880
i may be confusing multiple types of
 

3171
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:01,829
i may be confusing multiple types of
propellant-less

3172
00:57:01,829 --> 00:57:01,839
propellant-less
 

3173
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:05,750
propellant-less
forces but um that

3174
00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:05,760
forces but um that
 

3175
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:08,069
forces but um that
that could be real and could be

3176
00:57:08,069 --> 00:57:08,079
that could be real and could be
 

3177
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:09,030
that could be real and could be
something that

3178
00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:09,040
something that
 

3179
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:11,829
something that
that we use eventually what would be the

3180
00:57:11,829 --> 00:57:11,839
that we use eventually what would be the
 

3181
00:57:11,839 --> 00:57:12,950
that we use eventually what would be the
power source

3182
00:57:12,950 --> 00:57:12,960
power source
 

3183
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:15,829
power source
yeah the most recent engine like this

3184
00:57:15,829 --> 00:57:15,839
yeah the most recent engine like this
 

3185
00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:16,470
yeah the most recent engine like this
that

3186
00:57:16,470 --> 00:57:16,480
that
 

3187
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:19,750
that
has was just debunked this year

3188
00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:19,760
has was just debunked this year
 

3189
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:21,829
has was just debunked this year
i think in in march or something was

3190
00:57:21,829 --> 00:57:21,839
i think in in march or something was
 

3191
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:23,750
i think in in march or something was
called the m drive and

3192
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:23,760
called the m drive and
 

3193
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:27,190
called the m drive and
um supposedly you used a power source so

3194
00:57:27,190 --> 00:57:27,200
um supposedly you used a power source so
 

3195
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,430
um supposedly you used a power source so
you know batteries or solar panels to

3196
00:57:29,430 --> 00:57:29,440
you know batteries or solar panels to
 

3197
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,589
you know batteries or solar panels to
generate microwaves into this resonant

3198
00:57:31,589 --> 00:57:31,599
generate microwaves into this resonant
 

3199
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:33,270
generate microwaves into this resonant
cavity

3200
00:57:33,270 --> 00:57:33,280
cavity
 

3201
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:36,150
cavity
and people claimed it produced thrust so

3202
00:57:36,150 --> 00:57:36,160
and people claimed it produced thrust so
 

3203
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:36,549
and people claimed it produced thrust so
they

3204
00:57:36,549 --> 00:57:36,559
they
 

3205
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:38,390
they
they went straight from this really

3206
00:57:38,390 --> 00:57:38,400
they went straight from this really
 

3207
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:40,309
they went straight from this really
loose concept to building a device and

3208
00:57:40,309 --> 00:57:40,319
loose concept to building a device and
 

3209
00:57:40,319 --> 00:57:41,750
loose concept to building a device and
testing it and they said

3210
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:41,760
testing it and they said
 

3211
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,670
testing it and they said
we've measured thrust and sure on their

3212
00:57:43,670 --> 00:57:43,680
we've measured thrust and sure on their
 

3213
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:46,230
we've measured thrust and sure on their
thrust balance they saw thrust and

3214
00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:46,240
thrust balance they saw thrust and
 

3215
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:47,990
thrust balance they saw thrust and
different researchers built it and

3216
00:57:47,990 --> 00:57:48,000
different researchers built it and
 

3217
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,750
different researchers built it and
tested it and got the same measurements

3218
00:57:49,750 --> 00:57:49,760
tested it and got the same measurements
 

3219
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,349
tested it and got the same measurements
and so it was looking actually pretty

3220
00:57:51,349 --> 00:57:51,359
and so it was looking actually pretty
 

3221
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:52,549
and so it was looking actually pretty
good

3222
00:57:52,549 --> 00:57:52,559
good
 

3223
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:54,069
good
no one could explain how it worked but

3224
00:57:54,069 --> 00:57:54,079
no one could explain how it worked but
 

3225
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:55,750
no one could explain how it worked but
what they said was that

3226
00:57:55,750 --> 00:57:55,760
what they said was that
 

3227
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:59,190
what they said was that
um this inside the cavity

3228
00:57:59,190 --> 00:57:59,200
um this inside the cavity
 

3229
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:01,430
um this inside the cavity
um the microwaves themselves didn't

3230
00:58:01,430 --> 00:58:01,440
um the microwaves themselves didn't
 

3231
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,430
um the microwaves themselves didn't
change but the speed of light changed

3232
00:58:03,430 --> 00:58:03,440
change but the speed of light changed
 

3233
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:06,069
change but the speed of light changed
inside the cavity so relative to that

3234
00:58:06,069 --> 00:58:06,079
inside the cavity so relative to that
 

3235
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:08,630
inside the cavity so relative to that
um you know there their momentum was

3236
00:58:08,630 --> 00:58:08,640
um you know there their momentum was
 

3237
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:09,589
um you know there their momentum was
conserved

3238
00:58:09,589 --> 00:58:09,599
conserved
 

3239
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:13,829
conserved
um and i don't you know i

3240
00:58:13,829 --> 00:58:13,839
um and i don't you know i
 

3241
00:58:13,839 --> 00:58:16,549
um and i don't you know i
whatever um but finally someone i think

3242
00:58:16,549 --> 00:58:16,559
whatever um but finally someone i think
 

3243
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:18,309
whatever um but finally someone i think
at nasa built the device

3244
00:58:18,309 --> 00:58:18,319
at nasa built the device
 

3245
00:58:18,319 --> 00:58:20,230
at nasa built the device
tested it got the same thrust then

3246
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:20,240
tested it got the same thrust then
 

3247
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:22,150
tested it got the same thrust then
unhooked it flipped it backwards and

3248
00:58:22,150 --> 00:58:22,160
unhooked it flipped it backwards and
 

3249
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:23,990
unhooked it flipped it backwards and
turned it on but got the same thrust

3250
00:58:23,990 --> 00:58:24,000
turned it on but got the same thrust
 

3251
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,510
turned it on but got the same thrust
in the same direction again and so

3252
00:58:25,510 --> 00:58:25,520
in the same direction again and so
 

3253
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:27,190
in the same direction again and so
they're like this is just an interaction

3254
00:58:27,190 --> 00:58:27,200
they're like this is just an interaction
 

3255
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:28,630
they're like this is just an interaction
with the test setup or

3256
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:28,640
with the test setup or
 

3257
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:29,829
with the test setup or
you know some of the chamber or

3258
00:58:29,829 --> 00:58:29,839
you know some of the chamber or
 

3259
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:32,069
you know some of the chamber or
something like that so um

3260
00:58:32,069 --> 00:58:32,079
something like that so um
 

3261
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:35,190
something like that so um
forward it again um but you know it

3262
00:58:35,190 --> 00:58:35,200
forward it again um but you know it
 

3263
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:37,190
forward it again um but you know it
would be so wonderful for everybody if

3264
00:58:37,190 --> 00:58:37,200
would be so wonderful for everybody if
 

3265
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:39,109
would be so wonderful for everybody if
we could figure out how to do it but i

3266
00:58:39,109 --> 00:58:39,119
we could figure out how to do it but i
 

3267
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:39,990
we could figure out how to do it but i
don't know

3268
00:58:39,990 --> 00:58:40,000
don't know
 

3269
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,990
don't know
that's an interesting twist on it

3270
00:58:41,990 --> 00:58:42,000
that's an interesting twist on it
 

3271
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,670
that's an interesting twist on it
because that's more about

3272
00:58:43,670 --> 00:58:43,680
because that's more about
 

3273
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:46,390
because that's more about
efficient travel long distance travel

3274
00:58:46,390 --> 00:58:46,400
efficient travel long distance travel
 

3275
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:49,589
efficient travel long distance travel
right that's not necessarily about speed

3276
00:58:49,589 --> 00:58:49,599
right that's not necessarily about speed
 

3277
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:52,549
right that's not necessarily about speed
that's more about enabling like yeah so

3278
00:58:52,549 --> 00:58:52,559
that's more about enabling like yeah so
 

3279
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:54,309
that's more about enabling like yeah so
hook that up to the nuclear

3280
00:58:54,309 --> 00:58:54,319
hook that up to the nuclear
 

3281
00:58:54,319 --> 00:58:57,990
hook that up to the nuclear
power supply there you go okay yeah

3282
00:58:57,990 --> 00:58:58,000
power supply there you go okay yeah
 

3283
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,870
power supply there you go okay yeah
but still in terms of speed in terms of

3284
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:00,880
but still in terms of speed in terms of
 

3285
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:01,829
but still in terms of speed in terms of
trying to

3286
00:59:01,829 --> 00:59:01,839
trying to
 

3287
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:05,670
trying to
so there's recently us already i think

3288
00:59:05,670 --> 00:59:05,680
so there's recently us already i think
 

3289
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:07,589
so there's recently us already i think
been debunked or close to being debunked

3290
00:59:07,589 --> 00:59:07,599
been debunked or close to being debunked
 

3291
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:08,950
been debunked or close to being debunked
but the

3292
00:59:08,950 --> 00:59:08,960
but the
 

3293
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:12,069
but the
uh signal a weird signal from

3294
00:59:12,069 --> 00:59:12,079
uh signal a weird signal from
 

3295
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:15,190
uh signal a weird signal from
our nearby friends nearby exoplanets

3296
00:59:15,190 --> 00:59:15,200
our nearby friends nearby exoplanets
 

3297
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:15,750
our nearby friends nearby exoplanets
from

3298
00:59:15,750 --> 00:59:15,760
from
 

3299
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:18,870
from
proxima centauri

3300
00:59:18,870 --> 00:59:18,880
proxima centauri
 

3301
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:22,390
proxima centauri
a signal that's 4.2 light years away

3302
00:59:22,390 --> 00:59:22,400
a signal that's 4.2 light years away
 

3303
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:26,390
a signal that's 4.2 light years away
so you know the the thought is uh

3304
00:59:26,390 --> 00:59:26,400
so you know the the thought is uh
 

3305
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,309
so you know the the thought is uh
it'd be it'd be kind of cool if there's

3306
00:59:28,309 --> 00:59:28,319
it'd be it'd be kind of cool if there's
 

3307
00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:30,950
it'd be it'd be kind of cool if there's
life out there alien life

3308
00:59:30,950 --> 00:59:30,960
life out there alien life
 

3309
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:32,710
life out there alien life
uh but it'd be really cool if you could

3310
00:59:32,710 --> 00:59:32,720
uh but it'd be really cool if you could
 

3311
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:34,230
uh but it'd be really cool if you could
fly out there and check

3312
00:59:34,230 --> 00:59:34,240
fly out there and check
 

3313
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:37,430
fly out there and check
and so what kind of propulsion and did

3314
00:59:37,430 --> 00:59:37,440
and so what kind of propulsion and did
 

3315
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:38,309
and so what kind of propulsion and did
you think about

3316
00:59:38,309 --> 00:59:38,319
you think about
 

3317
00:59:38,319 --> 00:59:39,670
you think about
what kind of propulsion will allow us to

3318
00:59:39,670 --> 00:59:39,680
what kind of propulsion will allow us to
 

3319
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:41,910
what kind of propulsion will allow us to
travel close to the speed of light

3320
00:59:41,910 --> 00:59:41,920
travel close to the speed of light
 

3321
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:43,670
travel close to the speed of light
or you know half the speed of light all

3322
00:59:43,670 --> 00:59:43,680
or you know half the speed of light all
 

3323
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,270
or you know half the speed of light all
those kinds of things that would allow

3324
00:59:45,270 --> 00:59:45,280
those kinds of things that would allow
 

3325
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:47,190
those kinds of things that would allow
us to get to proxima centauri and have

3326
00:59:47,190 --> 00:59:47,200
us to get to proxima centauri and have
 

3327
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:48,230
us to get to proxima centauri and have
reasonable

3328
00:59:48,230 --> 00:59:48,240
reasonable
 

3329
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:51,270
reasonable
in a lifetime you know there's the

3330
00:59:51,270 --> 00:59:51,280
in a lifetime you know there's the
 

3331
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:52,150
in a lifetime you know there's the
project

3332
00:59:52,150 --> 00:59:52,160
project
 

3333
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:55,430
project
breakthrough star shot yeah um

3334
00:59:55,430 --> 00:59:55,440
breakthrough star shot yeah um
 

3335
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,430
breakthrough star shot yeah um
that's looking at sending those tiny

3336
00:59:57,430 --> 00:59:57,440
that's looking at sending those tiny
 

3337
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:58,870
that's looking at sending those tiny
little chip sets

3338
00:59:58,870 --> 00:59:58,880
little chip sets
 

3339
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:02,069
little chip sets
um accelerating really fast yeah

3340
01:00:02,069 --> 01:00:02,079
um accelerating really fast yeah
 

3341
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:04,309
um accelerating really fast yeah
using a laser so launching them and then

3342
01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:04,319
using a laser so launching them and then
 

3343
01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:05,109
using a laser so launching them and then
while they're still

3344
01:00:05,109 --> 01:00:05,119
while they're still
 

3345
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:06,950
while they're still
relatively close to the earth you know

3346
01:00:06,950 --> 01:00:06,960
relatively close to the earth you know
 

3347
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:08,950
relatively close to the earth you know
blasting them with some

3348
01:00:08,950 --> 01:00:08,960
blasting them with some
 

3349
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:12,309
blasting them with some
i forget what even what power level you

3350
01:00:12,309 --> 01:00:12,319
i forget what even what power level you
 

3351
01:00:12,319 --> 01:00:13,270
i forget what even what power level you
needed to

3352
01:00:13,270 --> 01:00:13,280
needed to
 

3353
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:14,789
needed to
to accelerate them fast enough to get

3354
01:00:14,789 --> 01:00:14,799
to accelerate them fast enough to get
 

3355
01:00:14,799 --> 01:00:16,630
to accelerate them fast enough to get
there in 20 years crazy sounding

3356
01:00:16,630 --> 01:00:16,640
there in 20 years crazy sounding
 

3357
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:18,710
there in 20 years crazy sounding
but uh a lot of people say that's a

3358
01:00:18,710 --> 01:00:18,720
but uh a lot of people say that's a
 

3359
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:20,870
but uh a lot of people say that's a
legitimate like it's crazy sounding but

3360
01:00:20,870 --> 01:00:20,880
legitimate like it's crazy sounding but
 

3361
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:23,349
legitimate like it's crazy sounding but
it can actually pull it off yeah i love

3362
01:00:23,349 --> 01:00:23,359
it can actually pull it off yeah i love
 

3363
01:00:23,359 --> 01:00:25,030
it can actually pull it off yeah i love
that project because there are a lot of

3364
01:00:25,030 --> 01:00:25,040
that project because there are a lot of
 

3365
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:26,549
that project because there are a lot of
different aspects you know there's the

3366
01:00:26,549 --> 01:00:26,559
different aspects you know there's the
 

3367
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:27,190
different aspects you know there's the
laser

3368
01:00:27,190 --> 01:00:27,200
laser
 

3369
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:30,390
laser
there's how do you then um

3370
01:00:30,390 --> 01:00:30,400
there's how do you then um
 

3371
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:31,750
there's how do you then um
get enough power when you're there to

3372
01:00:31,750 --> 01:00:31,760
get enough power when you're there to
 

3373
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:33,910
get enough power when you're there to
send a signal back no part of that

3374
01:00:33,910 --> 01:00:33,920
send a signal back no part of that
 

3375
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:35,910
send a signal back no part of that
project is possible right now but i

3376
01:00:35,910 --> 01:00:35,920
project is possible right now but i
 

3377
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:38,150
project is possible right now but i
think it's really exciting

3378
01:00:38,150 --> 01:00:38,160
think it's really exciting
 

3379
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:41,510
think it's really exciting
but do you uh do you see like human

3380
01:00:41,510 --> 01:00:41,520
but do you uh do you see like human
 

3381
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:43,670
but do you uh do you see like human
uh like a spacecraft with a human on it

3382
01:00:43,670 --> 01:00:43,680
uh like a spacecraft with a human on it
 

3383
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:45,430
uh like a spacecraft with a human on it
so it's like a heavy one

3384
01:00:45,430 --> 01:00:45,440
so it's like a heavy one
 

3385
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:47,750
so it's like a heavy one
being like us inventing new propulsion

3386
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:47,760
being like us inventing new propulsion
 

3387
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:48,870
being like us inventing new propulsion

3389
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:51,270
systems entirely
like do you ever see that in the on the

3390
01:00:51,270 --> 01:00:51,280
like do you ever see that in the on the
 

3391
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:52,230
like do you ever see that in the on the
radar

3392
01:00:52,230 --> 01:00:52,240
radar
 

3393
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:54,150

of propulsion systems like that or are

3394
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:54,160
of propulsion systems like that or are
 

3395
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:55,750
of propulsion systems like that or are
they completely out there

3396
01:00:55,750 --> 01:00:55,760
they completely out there
 

3397
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:58,069
they completely out there
in the impossible well we're going to

3398
01:00:58,069 --> 01:00:58,079
in the impossible well we're going to
 

3399
01:00:58,079 --> 01:00:58,870
in the impossible well we're going to
quickly

3400

leave the realm of what i can describe

3402
01:01:01,270 --> 01:01:01,280
leave the realm of what i can describe
 

3403
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:02,390
leave the realm of what i can describe

01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:05,430
with any
credibility but i think

3406
01:01:05,430 --> 01:01:05,440
credibility but i think
 

3407
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:08,069
credibility but i think
i think because of special relativity if

3408
01:01:08,069 --> 01:01:08,079
i think because of special relativity if
 

3409
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:09,750
i think because of special relativity if
we try to accelerate

3410
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:09,760
we try to accelerate
 

3411
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:12,230
we try to accelerate
some mass to close to the speed of light

3412
01:01:12,230 --> 01:01:12,240
some mass to close to the speed of light
 

3413
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:13,349
some mass to close to the speed of light
it becomes

3414
01:01:13,349 --> 01:01:13,359
it becomes
 

3415
01:01:13,359 --> 01:01:16,870
it becomes
infinitely heavy and then we just don't

3416
01:01:16,870 --> 01:01:16,880
infinitely heavy and then we just don't
 

3417
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:19,510
infinitely heavy and then we just don't
we'd have to like harness a lot of suns

3418
01:01:19,510 --> 01:01:19,520
we'd have to like harness a lot of suns
 

3419
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:21,670
we'd have to like harness a lot of suns
to do that or you know it's just

3420
01:01:21,670 --> 01:01:21,680
to do that or you know it's just
 

3421
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:24,950
to do that or you know it's just
that that math doesn't quite work out

3422
01:01:24,950 --> 01:01:24,960
that that math doesn't quite work out
 

3423
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:28,230
that that math doesn't quite work out
but you know in in my

3424
01:01:28,230 --> 01:01:28,240
but you know in in my
 

3425
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:31,030
but you know in in my
child's my childlike heart i believe

3426
01:01:31,030 --> 01:01:31,040
child's my childlike heart i believe
 

3427
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:31,510
child's my childlike heart i believe
that

3428
01:01:31,510 --> 01:01:31,520
that
 

3429
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:33,990
that
you know we're missing something um

3430
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:34,000
you know we're missing something um
 

3431
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:34,950
you know we're missing something um
whether it's

3432
01:01:34,950 --> 01:01:34,960
whether it's
 

3433
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:38,150
whether it's
you know dark matter or other dimensions

3434
01:01:38,150 --> 01:01:38,160
you know dark matter or other dimensions
 

3435
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:39,670
you know dark matter or other dimensions
and if you can just

3436
01:01:39,670 --> 01:01:39,680
and if you can just
 

3437
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:43,430
and if you can just
have some anti-matter and a

3438
01:01:43,430 --> 01:01:43,440
have some anti-matter and a
 

3439
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:46,630
have some anti-matter and a
black hole and then ride that around and

3440
01:01:46,630 --> 01:01:46,640
black hole and then ride that around and
 

3441
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:47,589
black hole and then ride that around and
somehow

3442
01:01:47,589 --> 01:01:47,599
somehow
 

3443
01:01:47,599 --> 01:01:49,910
somehow
you know turn that into some mess with

3444
01:01:49,910 --> 01:01:49,920
you know turn that into some mess with
 

3445
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:51,109
you know turn that into some mess with
gravity somehow

3446
01:01:51,109 --> 01:01:51,119
gravity somehow
 

3447
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:54,390
gravity somehow
yeah i i feel like we're missing

3448
01:01:54,390 --> 01:01:54,400
yeah i i feel like we're missing
 

3449
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:57,829
yeah i i feel like we're missing
lots of things in this puzzle and

3450
01:01:57,829 --> 01:01:57,839
lots of things in this puzzle and
 

3451
01:01:57,839 --> 01:02:00,710
lots of things in this puzzle and
that you know i wonder how is that

3452
01:02:00,710 --> 01:02:00,720
that you know i wonder how is that
 

3453
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:01,190
that you know i wonder how is that
puzzle

3454
01:02:01,190 --> 01:02:01,200
puzzle
 

3455
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:02,710
puzzle
yeah right well i can speak with

3456
01:02:02,710 --> 01:02:02,720
yeah right well i can speak with
 

3457
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:04,710
yeah right well i can speak with
confidence as a descendant of

3458
01:02:04,710 --> 01:02:04,720
confidence as a descendant of
 

3459
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:07,670
confidence as a descendant of
uh apes that we don't know what the hell

3460
01:02:07,670 --> 01:02:07,680
uh apes that we don't know what the hell
 

3461
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:08,390
uh apes that we don't know what the hell
we're doing

3462
01:02:08,390 --> 01:02:08,400
we're doing
 

3463
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:12,150
we're doing
yeah so there's uh we're like really

3464
01:02:12,150 --> 01:02:12,160
yeah so there's uh we're like really
 

3465
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:13,990
yeah so there's uh we're like really
confident like physicists are really

3466
01:02:13,990 --> 01:02:14,000
confident like physicists are really
 

3467
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,349
confident like physicists are really
confident that we've like

3468
01:02:15,349 --> 01:02:15,359
confident that we've like
 

3469
01:02:15,359 --> 01:02:17,910
confident that we've like
got most of the picture down right it

3470
01:02:17,910 --> 01:02:17,920
got most of the picture down right it
 

3471
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:19,670
got most of the picture down right it
feels like

3472
01:02:19,670 --> 01:02:19,680
feels like
 

3473
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:22,710
feels like
oh boy it feels like that we might not

3474
01:02:22,710 --> 01:02:22,720
oh boy it feels like that we might not
 

3475
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:23,430
oh boy it feels like that we might not
even

3476
01:02:23,430 --> 01:02:23,440
even
 

3477
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:25,829
even
be getting started on some of the

3478
01:02:25,829 --> 01:02:25,839
be getting started on some of the
 

3479
01:02:25,839 --> 01:02:26,789
be getting started on some of the
essential things

3480
01:02:26,789 --> 01:02:26,799
essential things
 

3481
01:02:26,799 --> 01:02:30,549
essential things
that um that would allow us to engineer

3482
01:02:30,549 --> 01:02:30,559
that um that would allow us to engineer
 

3483
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:31,670
that um that would allow us to engineer
systems that

3484
01:02:31,670 --> 01:02:31,680
systems that
 

3485
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:35,190
systems that
would allows to travel to space much

3486
01:02:35,190 --> 01:02:35,200
would allows to travel to space much
 

3487
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:36,630
would allows to travel to space much
much faster

3488
01:02:36,630 --> 01:02:36,640
much faster
 

3489
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:39,430
much faster
yeah and there's even things that are

3490
01:02:39,430 --> 01:02:39,440
yeah and there's even things that are
 

3491
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:40,150
yeah and there's even things that are
much more

3492
01:02:40,150 --> 01:02:40,160
much more
 

3493
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:42,470
much more
commonplace that we can't explain but

3494
01:02:42,470 --> 01:02:42,480
commonplace that we can't explain but
 

3495
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:44,710
commonplace that we can't explain but
we've started to take for granted like

3496
01:02:44,710 --> 01:02:44,720
we've started to take for granted like
 

3497
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:48,230
we've started to take for granted like
um quantum tunneling you know um

3498
01:02:48,230 --> 01:02:48,240
um quantum tunneling you know um
 

3499
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:50,309
um quantum tunneling you know um
just things like oh the electron was

3500
01:02:50,309 --> 01:02:50,319
just things like oh the electron was
 

3501
01:02:50,319 --> 01:02:52,230
just things like oh the electron was
here with this energy and now it's here

3502
01:02:52,230 --> 01:02:52,240
here with this energy and now it's here
 

3503
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:53,430
here with this energy and now it's here
with this energy and

3504
01:02:53,430 --> 01:02:53,440
with this energy and
 

3505
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:56,549
with this energy and
it's just tunneling um but so i you know

3506
01:02:56,549 --> 01:02:56,559
it's just tunneling um but so i you know
 

3507
01:02:56,559 --> 01:02:58,710
it's just tunneling um but so i you know
we're missing a lot of the picture so

3508
01:02:58,710 --> 01:02:58,720
we're missing a lot of the picture so
 

3509
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:01,750
we're missing a lot of the picture so
yeah i don't know to

3510
01:03:01,750 --> 01:03:01,760
yeah i don't know to
 

3511
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:03,029
yeah i don't know to
you know use your same question from

3512
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:03,039
you know use your same question from
 

3513
01:03:03,039 --> 01:03:04,870
you know use your same question from
earlier i don't know if you and i will

3514
01:03:04,870 --> 01:03:04,880
earlier i don't know if you and i will
 

3515
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:07,910
earlier i don't know if you and i will
see it but um yeah someday

3516
01:03:07,910 --> 01:03:07,920
see it but um yeah someday
 

3517
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:09,750
see it but um yeah someday
you uh you're the co-founder of just

3518
01:03:09,750 --> 01:03:09,760
you uh you're the co-founder of just
 

3519
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:11,109
you uh you're the co-founder of just
like we've been talking about axion

3520
01:03:11,109 --> 01:03:11,119
like we've been talking about axion
 

3521
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:11,670
like we've been talking about axion
systems

3522
01:03:11,670 --> 01:03:11,680
systems
 

3523
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:14,710
systems
uh yeah this is would you say space

3524
01:03:14,710 --> 01:03:14,720
uh yeah this is would you say space
 

3525
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:15,829
uh yeah this is would you say space
propulsion company

3526

01:03:20,150 --> 01:03:20,160
yes broadly speaking um so
 

3529
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:23,430
yes broadly speaking um so
how do you big question how do you uh

3530
01:03:23,430 --> 01:03:23,440
how do you big question how do you uh
 

3531
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:27,510
how do you big question how do you uh
build a rocket company from like

3532
01:03:27,510 --> 01:03:27,520
build a rocket company from like
 

3533
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:30,789
build a rocket company from like
a propulsion company from one person

3534
01:03:30,789 --> 01:03:30,799
a propulsion company from one person
 

3535
01:03:30,799 --> 01:03:32,230
a propulsion company from one person
from two people

3536
01:03:32,230 --> 01:03:32,240
from two people
 

3537
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:36,630
from two people
to ten people plus and actually

3538
01:03:36,630 --> 01:03:36,640
to ten people plus and actually
 

3539
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:41,190
to ten people plus and actually
you know take it to a successful product

3540
01:03:41,190 --> 01:03:41,200
you know take it to a successful product
 

3541
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:43,670
you know take it to a successful product
yeah well i think the early stage is

3542
01:03:43,670 --> 01:03:43,680
yeah well i think the early stage is
 

3543
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:45,510
yeah well i think the early stage is
quite

3544
01:03:45,510 --> 01:03:45,520
quite
 

3545
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:48,309
quite
uh i'm not supposed to use the word easy

3546
01:03:48,309 --> 01:03:48,319
uh i'm not supposed to use the word easy
 

3547
01:03:48,319 --> 01:03:50,150
uh i'm not supposed to use the word easy
when you work in rocket science but

3548
01:03:50,150 --> 01:03:50,160
when you work in rocket science but
 

3549
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,309
when you work in rocket science but
straightforward um when you're working

3550
01:03:52,309 --> 01:03:52,319
straightforward um when you're working
 

3551
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:54,630
straightforward um when you're working
on something you know sexy like an ion

3552
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:54,640
on something you know sexy like an ion

it's more straightforward to raise money

3556
01:03:58,150 --> 01:03:58,160
it's more straightforward to raise money
 

3557
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:00,069
it's more straightforward to raise money
and get people to come

3558
01:04:00,069 --> 01:04:00,079
and get people to come
 

3559
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:01,750
and get people to come
work for you because the vision's really

3560
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:01,760
work for you because the vision's really
 

3561
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:03,670
work for you because the vision's really
exciting and actually that's

3562
01:04:03,670 --> 01:04:03,680
exciting and actually that's
 

3563
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:05,430
exciting and actually that's
something i would say is very important

3564
01:04:05,430 --> 01:04:05,440
something i would say is very important
 

3565
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:07,750
something i would say is very important
throughout is

3566
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:07,760
throughout is
 

3567
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:10,470
throughout is
a really exciting vision because when

3568
01:04:10,470 --> 01:04:10,480
a really exciting vision because when
 

3569
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:11,510
a really exciting vision because when
everything

3570
01:04:11,510 --> 01:04:11,520
everything
 

3571
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:13,829
everything
you know goes to crap um you need that

3572
01:04:13,829 --> 01:04:13,839
you know goes to crap um you need that
 

3573
01:04:13,839 --> 01:04:15,190
you know goes to crap um you need that
to get people

3574
01:04:15,190 --> 01:04:15,200
to get people
 

3575
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:16,630
to get people
getting themselves out of bed in the

3576
01:04:16,630 --> 01:04:16,640
getting themselves out of bed in the
 

3577
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:18,789
getting themselves out of bed in the
morning and thinking of the

3578
01:04:18,789 --> 01:04:18,799
morning and thinking of the
 

3579
01:04:18,799 --> 01:04:21,910
morning and thinking of the
the higher purpose there um and

3580
01:04:21,910 --> 01:04:21,920
the higher purpose there um and
 

3581
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:24,069
the higher purpose there um and
you know another thing along the way

3582
01:04:24,069 --> 01:04:24,079
you know another thing along the way
 

3583
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:26,630
you know another thing along the way
that i think is key in in building

01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:06,390
later because of that um and i think
that's it's

3664
01:06:06,390 --> 01:06:06,400
that's it's
 

3665
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:09,190
that's it's
that's been because i'm introverted and

3666
01:06:09,190 --> 01:06:09,200
that's been because i'm introverted and
 

3667
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:10,390
that's been because i'm introverted and
i

3668

01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:14,789
you know want to poke my eyes out
instead of go and do small talk and so i

3672
01:06:14,789 --> 01:06:14,799
instead of go and do small talk and so i
 

3673
01:06:14,799 --> 01:06:16,950
instead of go and do small talk and so i
huddle in a corner with one person and

3674
01:06:16,950 --> 01:06:16,960
huddle in a corner with one person and
 

3675

like that and
um so you know that's all to say that

3680
01:06:22,870 --> 01:06:22,880
um so you know that's all to say that

genuine one
 

3687
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:30,549
genuine one
and let's see other ways to build a

3688
01:06:30,549 --> 01:06:30,559
and let's see other ways to build a
 

3689
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:32,230
and let's see other ways to build a
rocket company kind of

3690
01:06:32,230 --> 01:06:32,240
rocket company kind of
 

3691
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:33,510
rocket company kind of
making sure you're paying attention to

3692
01:06:33,510 --> 01:06:33,520
making sure you're paying attention to
 

3693
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:35,910
making sure you're paying attention to
the sweeping trends of the industry so

3694
01:06:35,910 --> 01:06:35,920
the sweeping trends of the industry so
 

3695
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:37,270
the sweeping trends of the industry so
everybody just cares about

3696
01:06:37,270 --> 01:06:37,280
everybody just cares about
 

3697
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:40,549
everybody just cares about
cost and um being able to get out

3698
01:06:40,549 --> 01:06:40,559
cost and um being able to get out
 

3699
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:43,109
cost and um being able to get out
ahead of that and even more than we ever

3700
01:06:43,109 --> 01:06:43,119
ahead of that and even more than we ever
 

3701
01:06:43,119 --> 01:06:44,710
ahead of that and even more than we ever
thought we'd need to as far as

3702
01:06:44,710 --> 01:06:44,720
thought we'd need to as far as
 

3703
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:46,789
thought we'd need to as far as
what we needed to price our systems at

3704
01:06:46,789 --> 01:06:46,799
what we needed to price our systems at
 

3705
01:06:46,799 --> 01:06:48,950
what we needed to price our systems at
you know people

3706
01:06:48,950 --> 01:06:48,960
you know people
 

3707
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:52,470
you know people
for since the start of the the us space

3708
01:06:52,470 --> 01:06:52,480
for since the start of the the us space
 

3709
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:53,589
for since the start of the the us space
industry they've been paying

3710
01:06:53,589 --> 01:06:53,599
industry they've been paying
 

3711
01:06:53,599 --> 01:06:57,270
industry they've been paying
20 25 million in adjusted dollars for an

3712
01:06:57,270 --> 01:06:57,280
20 25 million in adjusted dollars for an
 

3713
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:58,950
20 25 million in adjusted dollars for an
ion engine and

3714
01:06:58,950 --> 01:06:58,960
ion engine and
 

3715
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:02,230
ion engine and
seeing that now people are going to want

3716
01:07:02,230 --> 01:07:02,240
seeing that now people are going to want
 

3717
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:03,109
seeing that now people are going to want
to pay

3718
01:07:03,109 --> 01:07:03,119
to pay
 

3719
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:06,309
to pay
10k for an ion engine um

3720
01:07:06,309 --> 01:07:06,319
10k for an ion engine um
 

3721
01:07:06,319 --> 01:07:08,950
10k for an ion engine um
and just staying out ahead of that and

3722
01:07:08,950 --> 01:07:08,960
and just staying out ahead of that and
 

3723
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:10,150
and just staying out ahead of that and
those kinds of things

3724
01:07:10,150 --> 01:07:10,160
those kinds of things
 

3725
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:12,309
those kinds of things
um so you know being out in the industry

3726
01:07:12,309 --> 01:07:12,319
um so you know being out in the industry
 

3727
01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:14,470
um so you know being out in the industry
and talking to as many people as

3728
01:07:14,470 --> 01:07:14,480
and talking to as many people as
 

3729
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:15,829
and talking to as many people as
possible so there's a drive

3730
01:07:15,829 --> 01:07:15,839
possible so there's a drive
 

3731
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:18,230
possible so there's a drive
i mean yeah spacex really pushed that

3732
01:07:18,230 --> 01:07:18,240
i mean yeah spacex really pushed that
 

3733
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:19,430
i mean yeah spacex really pushed that
frustrating for me

3734
01:07:19,430 --> 01:07:19,440
frustrating for me
 

3735
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:23,109
frustrating for me
yeah so uh spacex really pushed this

3736
01:07:23,109 --> 01:07:23,119
yeah so uh spacex really pushed this
 

3737
01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:26,230
yeah so uh spacex really pushed this
uh yeah the application of uh i guess

3738
01:07:26,230 --> 01:07:26,240
uh yeah the application of uh i guess
 

3739
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:28,390
uh yeah the application of uh i guess
capitalism of driving the price down

3740
01:07:28,390 --> 01:07:28,400
capitalism of driving the price down
 

3741
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:31,190
capitalism of driving the price down
of um basically forcing people to ask

3742
01:07:31,190 --> 01:07:31,200
of um basically forcing people to ask
 

3743
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:32,230
of um basically forcing people to ask
the question can be

3744
01:07:32,230 --> 01:07:32,240
the question can be
 

3745

the in terms of the technology in it
 

3801
01:08:31,199 --> 01:08:33,269
the in terms of the technology in it
it's really boringly the same thing and

3802
01:08:33,269 --> 01:08:33,279
it's really boringly the same thing and
 

3803
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:34,789
it's really boringly the same thing and
they're really afraid to have taken

3804
01:08:34,789 --> 01:08:34,799
they're really afraid to have taken
 

3805
01:08:34,799 --> 01:08:35,749
they're really afraid to have taken
risks

3806
01:08:35,749 --> 01:08:35,759
risks
 

3807
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:37,749
risks
and that's a big problem for rocket

3808
01:08:37,749 --> 01:08:37,759
and that's a big problem for rocket
 

3809
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:39,349
and that's a big problem for rocket
space too is like

3810
01:08:39,349 --> 01:08:39,359
space too is like
 

3811
01:08:39,359 --> 01:08:41,269
space too is like
you if you're cutting out costs you

3812
01:08:41,269 --> 01:08:41,279
you if you're cutting out costs you
 

3813
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:42,630
you if you're cutting out costs you
can't afford to innovate

3814
01:08:42,630 --> 01:08:42,640
can't afford to innovate
 

3815
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:45,110
can't afford to innovate
to try out new things and then yeah

3816
01:08:45,110 --> 01:08:45,120
to try out new things and then yeah
 

3817
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:46,789
to try out new things and then yeah
that's definitely true with i

3818
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:46,799
that's definitely true with i
 

3819
01:08:46,799 --> 01:08:49,990
that's definitely true with i
ion engine then right so but what

3820
01:08:49,990 --> 01:08:50,000
ion engine then right so but what
 

3821
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:53,189
ion engine then right so but what
um so how do you compete in this

3822
01:08:53,189 --> 01:08:53,199
um so how do you compete in this
 

3823
01:08:53,199 --> 01:08:55,590
um so how do you compete in this
uh in this space do you by the way see

3824
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:55,600
uh in this space do you by the way see
 

3825
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:58,070
uh in this space do you by the way see
spacex as a competitor

3826
01:08:58,070 --> 01:08:58,080
spacex as a competitor
 

3827
01:08:58,080 --> 01:08:59,910
spacex as a competitor
uh and what do you say in general about

3828
01:08:59,910 --> 01:08:59,920
uh and what do you say in general about
 

3829
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:02,309
uh and what do you say in general about
the competition in the space is it

3830
01:09:02,309 --> 01:09:02,319
the competition in the space is it
 

3831
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:04,470
the competition in the space is it
really difficult as a as a business to

3832
01:09:04,470 --> 01:09:04,480
really difficult as a as a business to
 

3833
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:06,709
really difficult as a as a business to
compete here no i

3834
01:09:06,709 --> 01:09:06,719
compete here no i
 

3835
01:09:06,719 --> 01:09:09,349
compete here no i
i don't see spacex as a competitor um

3836
01:09:09,349 --> 01:09:09,359
i don't see spacex as a competitor um
 

3837
01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:10,789
i don't see spacex as a competitor um
and i see them

3838
01:09:10,789 --> 01:09:10,799
and i see them
 

3839
01:09:10,799 --> 01:09:13,030
and i see them
as one day not too long from now a

3840
01:09:13,030 --> 01:09:13,040
as one day not too long from now a
 

3841
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:13,829
as one day not too long from now a
customer

3842
01:09:13,829 --> 01:09:13,839
customer
 

3843
01:09:13,839 --> 01:09:17,990
customer
hopefully um i mean to compete against

3844
01:09:17,990 --> 01:09:18,000
hopefully um i mean to compete against
 

3845
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:18,630
hopefully um i mean to compete against
that

3846
01:09:18,630 --> 01:09:18,640
that
 

3847
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:21,910
that
i think you just have to do things in an

3848
01:09:21,910 --> 01:09:21,920
i think you just have to do things in an
 

3849
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:25,269
i think you just have to do things in an
unconventional way so bringing silicon

3850
01:09:25,269 --> 01:09:25,279
unconventional way so bringing silicon
 

3851
01:09:25,279 --> 01:09:27,910
unconventional way so bringing silicon

people to the space station and
 

4015
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:31,669

private sector
 

4019
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:34,310
private sector
stepping up to fill in where the

4020
01:12:34,310 --> 01:12:34,320
stepping up to fill in where the
 

4021
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:36,070
stepping up to fill in where the
government has pulled back in the u.s

4022
01:12:36,070 --> 01:12:36,080
government has pulled back in the u.s
 

4023
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:38,390
government has pulled back in the u.s
and i think pulled back way too soon as

4024
01:12:38,390 --> 01:12:38,400
and i think pulled back way too soon as
 

4025
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:39,430
and i think pulled back way too soon as
far as

4026
01:12:39,430 --> 01:12:39,440
far as
 

4027
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:42,709
far as
exploration and science goes probably

4028
01:12:42,709 --> 01:12:42,719
exploration and science goes probably
 

4029
01:12:42,719 --> 01:12:43,990
exploration and science goes probably
pulled back at the right time

4030
01:12:43,990 --> 01:12:44,000
pulled back at the right time
 

4031
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:47,350
pulled back at the right time
for commercial things and getting that

4032
01:12:47,350 --> 01:12:47,360
for commercial things and getting that
 

4033
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:49,110
for commercial things and getting that
started but

4034
01:12:49,110 --> 01:12:49,120
started but
 

4035
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:51,750
started but
i'm really happy that it's even possible

4036
01:12:51,750 --> 01:12:51,760
i'm really happy that it's even possible
 

4037
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:52,950
i'm really happy that it's even possible
to do that with

4038
01:12:52,950 --> 01:12:52,960
to do that with
 

4039
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:55,830
to do that with
private money and and companies do you

4040
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:55,840
private money and and companies do you
 

4041
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:57,270
private money and and companies do you
like the the kind of the model of

4042
01:12:57,270 --> 01:12:57,280
like the the kind of the model of
 

4043
01:12:57,280 --> 01:12:58,470
like the the kind of the model of
competition

4044
01:12:58,470 --> 01:12:58,480
competition
 

4045
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:01,990
competition
of uh nasa funding i guess that's how it

4046
01:13:01,990 --> 01:13:02,000
of uh nasa funding i guess that's how it
 

4047
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,669
of uh nasa funding i guess that's how it
works is like they're providing quite a

4048
01:13:03,669 --> 01:13:03,679
works is like they're providing quite a
 

4049
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:05,350
works is like they're providing quite a
bit of money from the government

4050
01:13:05,350 --> 01:13:05,360
bit of money from the government
 

4051
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:08,070
bit of money from the government
and then then private companies compete

4052
01:13:08,070 --> 01:13:08,080
and then then private companies compete
 

4053
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:08,630
and then then private companies compete
to be

4054
01:13:08,630 --> 01:13:08,640
to be
 

4055
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:11,750
to be
uh to be the delivery vehicles for

4056
01:13:11,750 --> 01:13:11,760
uh to be the delivery vehicles for
 

4057
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:15,110
uh to be the delivery vehicles for
whichever the the the government

4058
01:13:15,110 --> 01:13:15,120
whichever the the the government
 

4059
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:15,750

missions

4060
01:13:15,750 --> 01:13:15,760
missions
 

4061
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:19,590
missions
like nasa missions yes i think for

4062
01:13:19,590 --> 01:13:19,600
like nasa missions yes i think for
 

4063
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:21,350
like nasa missions yes i think for
this type of mission is a little bit

4064
01:13:21,350 --> 01:13:21,360
this type of mission is a little bit
 

4065
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:22,790
this type of mission is a little bit
kind of straddles

4066
01:13:22,790 --> 01:13:22,800
kind of straddles
 

4067
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:26,310
kind of straddles
um commercial and and science so

4068
01:13:26,310 --> 01:13:26,320
um commercial and and science so
 

4069
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:29,110
um commercial and and science so

starting point of
 

4121
01:14:24,159 --> 01:14:27,430
starting point of
space exploration and science and and

4122
01:14:27,430 --> 01:14:27,440
space exploration and science and and
 

4123
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:30,149

4239
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:26,709
how to move something forward is more
important than

4240
01:16:26,709 --> 01:16:26,719
important than
 

4241
01:16:26,719 --> 01:16:28,950

taking all of the entrepreneurship

4242

01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:30,310
taking all of the entrepreneurship
classes

4244
01:16:30,310 --> 01:16:30,320
classes
 

4245
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:32,390
classes
in undergrad so being able to think

4246
01:16:32,390 --> 01:16:32,400
in undergrad so being able to think
 

4247
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:34,950
in undergrad so being able to think
deeply yeah yeah exactly

4248
01:16:34,950 --> 01:16:34,960
deeply yeah yeah exactly
 

4249
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:37,189
deeply yeah yeah exactly
yeah have you been surprised about how

4250
01:16:37,189 --> 01:16:37,199
yeah have you been surprised about how
 

4251
01:16:37,199 --> 01:16:39,189
yeah have you been surprised about how
much like pivoting is involved

4252
01:16:39,189 --> 01:16:39,199
much like pivoting is involved
 

4253
01:16:39,199 --> 01:16:41,350
much like pivoting is involved
like basically rethinking what you

4254
01:16:41,350 --> 01:16:41,360
like basically rethinking what you
 

4255
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:42,790
like basically rethinking what you
thought initially would be the right

4256
01:16:42,790 --> 01:16:42,800
thought initially would be the right
 

4257
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:44,070
thought initially would be the right
direction to go

4258
01:16:44,070 --> 01:16:44,080
direction to go
 

4259
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:46,390
direction to go
or is there if you think deeply enough

4260
01:16:46,390 --> 01:16:46,400
or is there if you think deeply enough
 

4261
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:47,590
or is there if you think deeply enough
that

4262
01:16:47,590 --> 01:16:47,600
that
 

4263
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:49,510
that
you can stick in the same direction for

4264
01:16:49,510 --> 01:16:49,520
you can stick in the same direction for
 

4265
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:50,709
you can stick in the same direction for
long enough so

4266
01:16:50,709 --> 01:16:50,719
long enough so
 

4267
01:16:50,719 --> 01:16:54,070
long enough so
our you know our guiding star

4268
01:16:54,070 --> 01:16:54,080
our you know our guiding star
 

4269
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:56,790
our you know our guiding star
hasn't changed at all um so that's been

4270
01:16:56,790 --> 01:16:56,800
hasn't changed at all um so that's been
 

4271
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:57,189
hasn't changed at all um so that's been
pretty

4272
01:16:57,189 --> 01:16:57,199
pretty
 

4273
01:16:57,199 --> 01:17:00,630
pretty
consistent but we within that we flip

4274
01:17:00,630 --> 01:17:00,640
consistent but we within that we flip
 

4275
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:01,669
consistent but we within that we flip
flop on

4276
01:17:01,669 --> 01:17:01,679
flop on
 

4277
01:17:01,679 --> 01:17:04,550
flop on
so many things um all the time and you

4278
01:17:04,550 --> 01:17:04,560
so many things um all the time and you
 

4279
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:06,550
so many things um all the time and you
know to give you one example it's

product that's well suited to
maybe a smaller less exciting segment of

4295
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:27,830
hit it out of the park right away and
we've flip-flopped between that and

we've flip-flopped between that and
 

4297
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:29,510
we've flip-flopped between that and
there's not a blanket

4298
01:17:29,510 --> 01:17:29,520
there's not a blanket
 

4299
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:31,590
there's not a blanket
answer and there are a lot of factors

4300
01:17:31,590 --> 01:17:31,600
answer and there are a lot of factors
 

4301
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:32,550
answer and there are a lot of factors
but

4302
01:17:32,550 --> 01:17:32,560
but
 

4303
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:35,669
but
that's a hard one and i think one

4304
01:17:35,669 --> 01:17:35,679
that's a hard one and i think one

but he does it in a
such a creative way i remember that one

such a creative way i remember that one
 

4573
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:28,390
such a creative way i remember that one
in particular because it

4574
01:22:28,390 --> 01:22:28,400

you know i read a ton as a kid too but
 

4577
01:22:30,719 --> 01:22:32,390
you know i read a ton as a kid too but
it kind of set me

4578
01:22:32,390 --> 01:22:32,400
it kind of set me
 

4579
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:34,390
it kind of set me
it was like the beginning of my adult

4580
01:22:34,390 --> 01:22:34,400
it was like the beginning of my adult
 

4581
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:35,430
it was like the beginning of my adult
reading life

4582
01:22:35,430 --> 01:22:35,440
reading life
 

4583
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:39,750
reading life
and um getting into classics and

4584

and um getting into classics and
 

4585
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:43,270
and um getting into classics and
um i kind of i do feel like i they seem

4586
01:22:43,270 --> 01:22:43,280
um i kind of i do feel like i they seem
 

4587
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:45,990
um i kind of i do feel like i they seem
intimidating maybe and then i realize

4588
01:22:45,990 --> 01:22:46,000
intimidating maybe and then i realize
 

4589
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,390
intimidating maybe and then i realize
that they're all just like love stories

4590
01:22:48,390 --> 01:22:48,400
that they're all just like love stories
 

4591
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:51,669
that they're all just like love stories
um uh so

4592
01:22:51,669 --> 01:22:51,679
um uh so
 

4593
01:22:51,679 --> 01:22:54,870
um uh so
yeah isn't everything yeah it's really

4594
01:22:54,870 --> 01:22:54,880
yeah isn't everything yeah it's really
 

4595
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:57,590
yeah isn't everything yeah it's really
at the bottom even you know i don't know

4596
01:22:57,590 --> 01:22:57,600
at the bottom even you know i don't know
 

4597
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:57,910
at the bottom even you know i don't know
i

4598
01:22:57,910 --> 01:22:57,920
i
 

4599
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:00,709
i
i was surprised that even like a lot of

4600
01:23:00,709 --> 01:23:00,719
i was surprised that even like a lot of
 

4601
01:23:00,719 --> 01:23:02,070
i was surprised that even like a lot of
the russian authors

4602
01:23:02,070 --> 01:23:02,080
the russian authors
 

4603
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:03,510
the russian authors
um you know that's all they're all just

4604
01:23:03,510 --> 01:23:03,520
um you know that's all they're all just
 

4605
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:05,110
um you know that's all they're all just
love stories

4606
01:23:05,110 --> 01:23:05,120
love stories
 

4607
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:06,470
love stories
are pretty simple there's not much to

4608
01:23:06,470 --> 01:23:06,480
are pretty simple there's not much to
 

4609
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:08,310
are pretty simple there's not much to
worry there's not much to work with so

4610
01:23:08,310 --> 01:23:08,320
worry there's not much to work with so
 

4611
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:10,070
worry there's not much to work with so
so i think maybe that was it it made

4612
01:23:10,070 --> 01:23:10,080
so i think maybe that was it it made
 

4613
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:12,229
so i think maybe that was it it made
like that whole world less intimidating

4614
01:23:12,229 --> 01:23:12,239
like that whole world less intimidating
 

4615
01:23:12,239 --> 01:23:13,189
like that whole world less intimidating
to me and

4616
01:23:13,189 --> 01:23:13,199
to me and
 

4617
01:23:13,199 --> 01:23:16,950
to me and
and cemented my love that's for reading

4618
01:23:16,950 --> 01:23:16,960
and cemented my love that's for reading
 

4619
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:18,149
and cemented my love that's for reading
people should have just approached the

4620
01:23:18,149 --> 01:23:18,159
people should have just approached the
 

4621
01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:20,070
people should have just approached the
classics like there's probably a lot of

4622
01:23:20,070 --> 01:23:20,080
classics like there's probably a lot of
 

4623
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:20,709
classics like there's probably a lot of
chick flicks

4624
01:23:20,709 --> 01:23:20,719
chick flicks
 

4625
01:23:20,719 --> 01:23:24,229
chick flicks
yeah so it somehow boils down to a chick

4626
01:23:24,229 --> 01:23:24,239
yeah so it somehow boils down to a chick
 

4627
01:23:24,239 --> 01:23:24,790
yeah so it somehow boils down to a chick
flight so

4628
01:23:24,790 --> 01:23:24,800
flight so
 

4629
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:28,229
flight so
just relax and enjoy the ride and then

4630
01:23:28,229 --> 01:23:28,239
just relax and enjoy the ride and then
 

4631
01:23:28,239 --> 01:23:32,709
just relax and enjoy the ride and then
so what else um changing gears

4632
01:23:32,709 --> 01:23:32,719
so what else um changing gears
 

4633
01:23:32,719 --> 01:23:35,189
so what else um changing gears
quite a bit um the beginning of infinity

4634
01:23:35,189 --> 01:23:35,199
quite a bit um the beginning of infinity
 

4635
01:23:35,199 --> 01:23:36,950
quite a bit um the beginning of infinity
do you know what by david deutsch

4636
01:23:36,950 --> 01:23:36,960
do you know what by david deutsch
 

4637
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:39,830
do you know what by david deutsch
um so he's a physicist um i think at

4638
01:23:39,830 --> 01:23:39,840
um so he's a physicist um i think at
 

4639
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:41,270
um so he's a physicist um i think at
cambridge or oxford

4640
01:23:41,270 --> 01:23:41,280
cambridge or oxford
 

4641
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:44,390
cambridge or oxford
and so i was introduced like more

4642
01:23:44,390 --> 01:23:44,400
and so i was introduced like more
 

4643
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:46,550
and so i was introduced like more
formally to a lot of the ideas like a

4644
01:23:46,550 --> 01:23:46,560
formally to a lot of the ideas like a
 

4645
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:47,030
formally to a lot of the ideas like a
lot of

4646
01:23:47,030 --> 01:23:47,040
lot of
 

4647
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:50,070
lot of
the things we've talked about he um

4648
01:23:50,070 --> 01:23:50,080
the things we've talked about he um
 

4649
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:53,430
the things we've talked about he um
has a lot more like formalism and

4650
01:23:53,430 --> 01:23:53,440
has a lot more like formalism and
 

4651
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:55,910
has a lot more like formalism and
physics rigor around and so i got

4652
01:23:55,910 --> 01:23:55,920
physics rigor around and so i got
 

4653
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:57,510
physics rigor around and so i got
introduced to you know

4654
01:23:57,510 --> 01:23:57,520
introduced to you know
 

4655
01:23:57,520 --> 01:23:59,590
introduced to you know
more like jargon of how to think about

4656
01:23:59,590 --> 01:23:59,600
more like jargon of how to think about
 

4657
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:02,629
more like jargon of how to think about
some of these ideas um

4658
01:24:02,629 --> 01:24:02,639
some of these ideas um
 

4659
01:24:02,639 --> 01:24:06,070
some of these ideas um
you know like memes and you know dna

4660
01:24:06,070 --> 01:24:06,080
you know like memes and you know dna
 

4661
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:10,470
you know like memes and you know dna
as as ultimate meme um

4662
01:24:10,470 --> 01:24:10,480
as as ultimate meme um
 

4663
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:13,750
as as ultimate meme um
the concept of infinity and um

4664
01:24:13,750 --> 01:24:13,760
the concept of infinity and um
 

4665
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:17,110
the concept of infinity and um
objective beauty um but he has a really

4666
01:24:17,110 --> 01:24:17,120
objective beauty um but he has a really
 

4667
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:19,430
objective beauty um but he has a really
strong grounding in in physics um and

4668
01:24:19,430 --> 01:24:19,440
strong grounding in in physics um and
 

4669
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:21,110
strong grounding in in physics um and
then there's a rigorous way of talking

4670
01:24:21,110 --> 01:24:21,120
then there's a rigorous way of talking
 

4671
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:22,550
then there's a rigorous way of talking
about these like big

4672
01:24:22,550 --> 01:24:22,560
about these like big
 

4673
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:25,750
about these like big
yeah so that was very mind

4674
01:24:25,750 --> 01:24:25,760
yeah so that was very mind
 

4675
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:29,030
yeah so that was very mind
opening to me to read that but it also

4676
01:24:29,030 --> 01:24:29,040
opening to me to read that but it also
 

4677
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:31,110
opening to me to read that but it also
i think is probably part of why i ended

4678
01:24:31,110 --> 01:24:31,120
i think is probably part of why i ended
 

4679
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:32,390
i think is probably part of why i ended

01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:45,590
able to answer these ask those questions
um that's maybe the turning point

5038
01:30:45,590 --> 01:30:45,600
um that's maybe the turning point
 

5039
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:48,629
um that's maybe the turning point
um and instead i i think it's really the

5040
01:30:48,629 --> 01:30:48,639
um and instead i i think it's really the
 

5041
01:30:48,639 --> 01:30:52,229
um and instead i i think it's really the
the pursuit and generation of knowledge

5042
01:30:52,229 --> 01:30:52,239
the pursuit and generation of knowledge
 

5043
01:30:52,239 --> 01:30:55,830
the pursuit and generation of knowledge
and and so if if we're taken out by an

5044
01:30:55,830 --> 01:30:55,840
and and so if if we're taken out by an
 

5045
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:57,910
and and so if if we're taken out by an
asteroid or something

5046
01:30:57,910 --> 01:30:57,920
asteroid or something
 

5047
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:00,950
asteroid or something
i think that it will have been a

5048
01:31:00,950 --> 01:31:00,960
i think that it will have been a
 

5049
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:04,870
i think that it will have been a
you know meaningful endeavor if somehow

5050
01:31:04,870 --> 01:31:04,880
you know meaningful endeavor if somehow
 

5051
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:07,910
you know meaningful endeavor if somehow
our knowledge about the universe is

5052
01:31:07,910 --> 01:31:07,920
our knowledge about the universe is
 

5053
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:09,430
our knowledge about the universe is
preserved somehow

5054
01:31:09,430 --> 01:31:09,440
preserved somehow
 

5055
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:12,790
preserved somehow
um and the next civilization isn't

5056
01:31:12,790 --> 01:31:12,800
um and the next civilization isn't
 

5057
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:13,430
um and the next civilization isn't
starting

5058
01:31:13,430 --> 01:31:13,440
starting
 

5059
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:17,189
starting
over again um so that that's

5060
01:31:17,189 --> 01:31:17,199
over again um so that that's
 

5061
01:31:17,199 --> 01:31:20,709
over again um so that that's
that's i always yeah i

5062
01:31:20,709 --> 01:31:20,719
that's i always yeah i
 

5063
01:31:20,719 --> 01:31:22,550
that's i always yeah i
resonated with that that i always loved

5064
01:31:22,550 --> 01:31:22,560
resonated with that that i always loved
 

5065
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:24,149
resonated with that that i always loved

today i'm sure there's a wikipedia page
 

5099
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:58,310
today i'm sure there's a wikipedia page
about ion engines and i'm sure it's

5100
01:31:58,310 --> 01:31:58,320
about ion engines and i'm sure it's
 

5101
01:31:58,320 --> 01:31:59,189
about ion engines and i'm sure it's
pretty good

5102
01:31:59,189 --> 01:31:59,199
pretty good
 

5103
01:31:59,199 --> 01:32:01,030
pretty good
yeah like it's i don't know that's

5104
01:32:01,030 --> 01:32:01,040
yeah like it's i don't know that's
 

5105
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:02,229
yeah like it's i don't know that's
that's incredible

that's incredible
and obviously that can be preserved

01:32:03,750 --> 01:32:03,760
and obviously that can be preserved
 

5109
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:06,390
and obviously that can be preserved
pretty efficiently at least wikipedia

5110

and then it will have been a

5130
01:32:26,550 --> 01:32:26,560
and then it will have been a
 

5131
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:28,149
and then it will have been a
civilization well spent

5132
01:32:28,149 --> 01:32:28,159
civilization well spent
 

5133
01:32:28,159 --> 01:32:31,110
civilization well spent
um so pushing that knowledge along yeah

5134
01:32:31,110 --> 01:32:31,120
um so pushing that knowledge along yeah
 

5135
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:31,430
um so pushing that knowledge along yeah
through

5136
01:32:31,430 --> 01:32:31,440
through
 

5137
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:34,950
through
like one little discovery at a time

5138
01:32:34,950 --> 01:32:34,960
like one little discovery at a time
 

5139
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:37,189
like one little discovery at a time
is is one of is a core aspect to the

5140
01:32:37,189 --> 01:32:37,199
is is one of is a core aspect to the
 

5141
01:32:37,199 --> 01:32:38,149
is is one of is a core aspect to the
meaning of it

5142
01:32:38,149 --> 01:32:38,159
meaning of it
 

5143
01:32:38,159 --> 01:32:41,350
meaning of it
of it all yes and i also i

5144
01:32:41,350 --> 01:32:41,360
of it all yes and i also i
 

5145
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:44,550
of it all yes and i also i
i haven't yet figured out what the

5146
01:32:44,550 --> 01:32:44,560
i haven't yet figured out what the
 

5147
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:46,790
i haven't yet figured out what the
connection you know an explanation i'm

5148
01:32:46,790 --> 01:32:46,800
connection you know an explanation i'm
 

5149
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:48,790
connection you know an explanation i'm
happy with yet for how it's connected

5150
01:32:48,790 --> 01:32:48,800
happy with yet for how it's connected
 

5151
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:49,510
happy with yet for how it's connected
but

5152
01:32:49,510 --> 01:32:49,520
but
 

5153
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:52,870
but
um evolving beyond

5154
01:32:52,870 --> 01:32:52,880
um evolving beyond
 

5155
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:55,669
um evolving beyond
just the the survival piece too i think

5156
01:32:55,669 --> 01:32:55,679
just the the survival piece too i think
 

5157
01:32:55,679 --> 01:32:57,590
just the the survival piece too i think
like we touched on the

5158
01:32:57,590 --> 01:32:57,600
like we touched on the
 

5159
01:32:57,600 --> 01:33:00,229
like we touched on the
the emotional aspect something in there

5160
01:33:00,229 --> 01:33:00,239
the emotional aspect something in there
 

5161
01:33:00,239 --> 01:33:01,709
the emotional aspect something in there
about

5162
01:33:01,709 --> 01:33:01,719
about
 

5163
01:33:01,719 --> 01:33:04,629
about
cooperation and you know love and

5164
01:33:04,629 --> 01:33:04,639
cooperation and you know love and
 

5165
01:33:04,639 --> 01:33:07,750
cooperation and you know love and
so i in my day-to-day that just boils

5166
01:33:07,750 --> 01:33:07,760
so i in my day-to-day that just boils
 

5167
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:08,149
so i in my day-to-day that just boils
down

5168
01:33:08,149 --> 01:33:08,159
down
 

5169
01:33:08,159 --> 01:33:11,189
down
to you know the pursuit of knowledge

5170
01:33:11,189 --> 01:33:11,199
to you know the pursuit of knowledge
 

5171
01:33:11,199 --> 01:33:14,310
to you know the pursuit of knowledge
or improving the human condition

5172
01:33:14,310 --> 01:33:14,320
or improving the human condition
 

5173
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:17,990
or improving the human condition
and being kind love and knowledge

5174
01:33:17,990 --> 01:33:18,000
and being kind love and knowledge
 

5175
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:21,189
and being kind love and knowledge
yeah exactly so i'm pretty at peace with

5176
01:33:21,189 --> 01:33:21,199
yeah exactly so i'm pretty at peace with
 

5177
01:33:21,199 --> 01:33:21,990
yeah exactly so i'm pretty at peace with
that as the

5178
01:33:21,990 --> 01:33:22,000
that as the
 

5179
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,390
that as the
meaning right now makes sense while you

5180
01:33:24,390 --> 01:33:24,400
meaning right now makes sense while you
 

5181
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:25,270
meaning right now makes sense while you
work on

5182
01:33:25,270 --> 01:33:25,280
work on
 

5183
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:28,310
work on
yeah spacecraft propulsion yes

5184
01:33:28,310 --> 01:33:28,320
yeah spacecraft propulsion yes
 

5185
01:33:28,320 --> 01:33:31,910
yeah spacecraft propulsion yes
exactly like literal rocket science

5186
01:33:31,910 --> 01:33:31,920
exactly like literal rocket science
 

5187
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:34,070
exactly like literal rocket science
natalia this is amazing conversation you

5188
01:33:34,070 --> 01:33:34,080
natalia this is amazing conversation you
 

5189
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:35,430
natalia this is amazing conversation you
work on such an exciting

5190
01:33:35,430 --> 01:33:35,440
work on such an exciting
 

5191
01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:38,550
work on such an exciting
engineering field and i think this is

5192
01:33:38,550 --> 01:33:38,560
engineering field and i think this is
 

5193
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:39,750
engineering field and i think this is
like what 20th

5194
01:33:39,750 --> 01:33:39,760
like what 20th
 

5195
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:41,830
like what 20th
uh 21st century will be remembered for

5196
01:33:41,830 --> 01:33:41,840
uh 21st century will be remembered for
 

5197
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:43,590
uh 21st century will be remembered for
as space exploration so

5198
01:33:43,590 --> 01:33:43,600
as space exploration so
 

5199
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:46,070
as space exploration so
