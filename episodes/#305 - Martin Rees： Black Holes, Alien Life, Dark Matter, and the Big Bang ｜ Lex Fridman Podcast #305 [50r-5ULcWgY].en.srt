there's no reason to think that the

00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:01,599
there's no reason to think that the
 

3
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:03,909
there's no reason to think that the
ocean ends just beyond your horizon and

ocean ends just beyond your horizon and

00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:06,710
ocean ends just beyond your horizon and
likewise there's no reason to think that

likewise there's no reason to think that

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,950
likewise there's no reason to think that
the aftermath of our big bang

the aftermath of our big bang

00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,310
the aftermath of our big bang
um ends

um ends
just

00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:11,120
just

00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,870
just
at the boundary for we can see indeed

at the boundary for we can see indeed

00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,030
at the boundary for we can see indeed
there are quite strong arguments

16
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:15,040
there are quite strong arguments
 

17
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,710
there are quite strong arguments
that it probably goes on about a hundred

18
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:16,720
that it probably goes on about a hundred
 

19
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,150
that it probably goes on about a hundred

times further
 

21
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,470

it may even go on so much further

it may even go on so much further
 

23
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,189
it may even go on so much further
that uh all combinatorials are

101
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,789
last 20 years mainly the last 10 has
been the realization that most of the

102
00:01:52,789 --> 00:01:52,799
been the realization that most of the
 

103
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,670
been the realization that most of the
stars in the sky are orbited by retinues

104
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:55,680
stars in the sky are orbited by retinues
 

105
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,789
stars in the sky are orbited by retinues
of planets

106
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:56,799
of planets
 

107
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,749
of planets
just as the sun is orbited by the earth

108
00:01:59,749 --> 00:01:59,759
just as the sun is orbited by the earth
 

109
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,149
just as the sun is orbited by the earth
and the other familiar planets and this

110
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:02,159
and the other familiar planets and this
 

111
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,749
and the other familiar planets and this
of course makes the night sky far more

112
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:03,759
of course makes the night sky far more
 

113
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,749
of course makes the night sky far more
interesting what you see up there aren't

114
00:02:05,749 --> 00:02:05,759
interesting what you see up there aren't
 

115
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,910
interesting what you see up there aren't
just points of light but they're

116
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:07,920
just points of light but they're
 

117
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,990
just points of light but they're
planetary systems and that raises the

118
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:10,000
planetary systems and that raises the
 

119
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,830
planetary systems and that raises the
question could there be life out there

120
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:11,840
question could there be life out there
 

121
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,270
question could there be life out there
and so that

122
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:13,280
and so that
 

123
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,190
and so that
is an exciting problem for the 21st

124
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:15,200
is an exciting problem for the 21st
 

125
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,190
is an exciting problem for the 21st
century so when you see all those lights

126
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:17,200
century so when you see all those lights
 

127
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,750
century so when you see all those lights
out there you immediately imagine all

128
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:19,760
out there you immediately imagine all
 

129
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,790
out there you immediately imagine all
the planetary worlds that are

130
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:22,800
the planetary worlds that are
 

131
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,790
the planetary worlds that are
around them and they potentially have

00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:24,800
around them and they potentially have
 

133
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,710
around them and they potentially have
all kinds of different

they have masses and um

149
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,190

if there's any life on any of them i

153
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,790
if there's any life on any of them i
mean it's entirely logically possible

154
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:46,800
mean it's entirely logically possible
 

155
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,869
mean it's entirely logically possible
that life is unique to this earth

156
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:48,879
that life is unique to this earth
 

157
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,350
that life is unique to this earth
doesn't exist anywhere on the other hand

158
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:51,360
doesn't exist anywhere on the other hand
 

159
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,270
doesn't exist anywhere on the other hand
uh it could be that the origin of life

160
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:53,280
uh it could be that the origin of life
 

161
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,030
uh it could be that the origin of life
is something which happens

162
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:55,040
is something which happens
 

163
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,869
is something which happens
routinely given conditions like the

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,390
of nature i think that may be a
limitation of the human brains

limitation of the human brains
 

337
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,990
limitation of the human brains
but i also

338
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:56,000
but i also
 

339
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,270
but i also
think that

340
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:57,280
think that
 

341
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,990
think that
we can perhaps aided by computer

342
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:00,000
we can perhaps aided by computer
 

343
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,749
we can perhaps aided by computer
simulations

344
00:06:01,749 --> 00:06:01,759

understand a bit more of the complexity

understand a bit more of the complexity
 

347
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,590
understand a bit more of the complexity
of nature but even understanding a

00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:07,600
of nature but even understanding a
 

349
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,189
of nature but even understanding a

from the atom up is very very difficult

from the atom up is very very difficult
 

353
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,430
from the atom up is very very difficult
and i think extreme reductionists

00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:15,440
and i think extreme reductionists
 

355
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,390
and i think extreme reductionists
have a very misleading perception they

have a very misleading perception they
 

357
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,189
have a very misleading perception they
tend to think that uh in a sense we are

but that
 

363
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,790

isn't the way we ever understand

that we

00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:30,560
that we
 

369
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,189

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,950
you can understand quite a lot
about how water behaves and how waves

even if you could solve that which you

even if you could solve that which you

clearly can't would not give you any
 

423
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,430
clearly can't would not give you any
insight so the important thing is that

insight so the important thing is that
 

425
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,909
insight so the important thing is that
every science has its own irreducible

so it may be in chemistry it's things

so it may be in chemistry it's things
 

433
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,830
so it may be in chemistry it's things

right so uh if you're interested in um
birds and how they fly uh then things

668
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:50,240
workings of it to the extent that we do
 

669
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,430
workings of it to the extent that we do
more or less

670
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:51,440
more or less
 

671
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,949
more or less
understand

672
00:11:52,949 --> 00:11:52,959
understand
 

673
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,870
understand
how

674
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:54,880
how
 

675
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,269
how
most phenomena can be explained in a

676
00:11:57,269 --> 00:11:57,279
most phenomena can be explained in a
 

677
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,949
most phenomena can be explained in a
fatal way because in case of quantum

678
00:11:58,949 --> 00:11:58,959
fatal way because in case of quantum
 

679
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,110
fatal way because in case of quantum
theory many people would say

680
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:01,120
theory many people would say
 

681
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,790
theory many people would say
understandably there's some mystery if

682
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:02,800
understandably there's some mystery if
 

683
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,629
understandably there's some mystery if
you don't quite understand why it works

684
00:12:04,629 --> 00:12:04,639
you don't quite understand why it works
 

685
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,550
you don't quite understand why it works
but there could be deeper mysteries when

686
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:06,560
but there could be deeper mysteries when
 

687
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,550
but there could be deeper mysteries when
we get to these unified theories where

688
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:08,560
we get to these unified theories where
 

689
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,389
we get to these unified theories where
there's a big gap between

690
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:10,399
there's a big gap between
 

691
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,389
there's a big gap between
what a computer can

692
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:12,399
what a computer can
 

693
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,150
what a computer can
print out for us at the end

694
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:14,160
print out for us at the end
 

695
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,550
print out for us at the end
and what we can actually grasp and think

696
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:16,560
and what we can actually grasp and think
 

697
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,230
and what we can actually grasp and think
through in our heads yeah it's

698
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:18,240
through in our heads yeah it's
 

699
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,430
through in our heads yeah it's
interesting that

700
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:19,440
interesting that
 

701
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,870
interesting that
the idea that there could be things a

702
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:20,880
the idea that there could be things a
 

703
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,910
the idea that there could be things a
computer could tell us that it's true

704
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:23,920
computer could tell us that it's true
 

705
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,190
computer could tell us that it's true
and maybe you can even help us

706
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:25,200
and maybe you can even help us
 

707
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,030
and maybe you can even help us
understand

708
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:27,040
understand
 

709
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,269
understand
why it's true a little bit but

710
00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:29,279
why it's true a little bit but
 

711
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,590
why it's true a little bit but
ultimately it's still a long journey to

712
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:31,600
ultimately it's still a long journey to
 

713
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,550
ultimately it's still a long journey to
really deeply understand the whys of it

714
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:34,560
really deeply understand the whys of it
 

715
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,509
really deeply understand the whys of it
uh

716
00:12:35,509 --> 00:12:35,519
uh
 

717
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,750
uh
yes that's the limitation of our brain

718
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:37,760
yes that's the limitation of our brain
 

719
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,750
yes that's the limitation of our brain
we can try to sneak up to it in

720
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:39,760
we can try to sneak up to it in
 

721
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,990
we can try to sneak up to it in
different ways given the limitations of

722
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:42,000
different ways given the limitations of
 

723
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,829
different ways given the limitations of
our brain have you i've gotten a chance

he's one of my heroes certainly
 

741
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,829
he's one of my heroes certainly
and i remember i'm sure he would say

742
00:13:01,829 --> 00:13:01,839
and i remember i'm sure he would say
 

743
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,230
and i remember i'm sure he would say
this and i remember the first time i met

744
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:04,240
this and i remember the first time i met
 

745
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,389
this and i remember the first time i met
him he said that he was like me he

746
00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:06,399
him he said that he was like me he
 

747
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,310
him he said that he was like me he
wanted to understand the universe

748
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:08,320
wanted to understand the universe
 

749
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,230
wanted to understand the universe
but he thought the best thing to do was

750
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:10,240
but he thought the best thing to do was
 

751
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,550
but he thought the best thing to do was
to try and develop ai and then with the

752
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:12,560
to try and develop ai and then with the
 

753
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,310
to try and develop ai and then with the
help of ai he'd stand more chance of

754
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:14,320
help of ai he'd stand more chance of
 

755
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,990
help of ai he'd stand more chance of
understanding the universe yeah and i

756
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:16,000
understanding the universe yeah and i
 

757
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,310
understanding the universe yeah and i
think he's right about that so and of

758
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:18,320
think he's right about that so and of
 

759
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,750
think he's right about that so and of
course um although we're

760
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:21,760
course um although we're
 

761
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,710
course um although we're
familiar with the way his uh computers

762
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:24,720
familiar with the way his uh computers
 

763
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,829
familiar with the way his uh computers
play go and uh chess um

764
00:13:27,829 --> 00:13:27,839
play go and uh chess um
 

765
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,350
play go and uh chess um
he's already made contributions to

00:13:35,269 --> 00:13:35,279
than the best human chemists and so
 

773
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,389
than the best human chemists and so
already he's on the path to showing

774
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:38,399
already he's on the path to showing
 

775
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,949
already he's on the path to showing
ways in which computers have the power

776
00:13:40,949 --> 00:13:40,959
ways in which computers have the power
 

777
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,829

to do better than humans and so um i

784
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:49,760
to do better than humans and so um i
 

785
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,030
to do better than humans and so um i
think he would resonate for what i've

786
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:51,040
think he would resonate for what i've
 

787
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,430
think he would resonate for what i've
just said that it may be that uh in

788
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:53,440
just said that it may be that uh in
 

789
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,590
just said that it may be that uh in
these other fundamental questions the

790
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:55,600
these other fundamental questions the
 

791
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,069
these other fundamental questions the
computers will play a crucial role

792
00:13:58,069 --> 00:13:58,079
computers will play a crucial role
 

793
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,990
computers will play a crucial role
yeah and they're also doing quantum

794
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:00,000
yeah and they're also doing quantum
 

795
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,150
yeah and they're also doing quantum
mechanical simulation of electrons

796
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:02,160
mechanical simulation of electrons
 

797
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,350

they're doing

798
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:03,360
they're doing
 

799
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,790
they're doing
uh control of of high temperature plasma

800
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:06,800
uh control of of high temperature plasma
 

801
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,629
uh control of of high temperature plasma
fusion reactors yes that's a new thing

802
00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:08,639
fusion reactors yes that's a new thing
 

803
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,750
fusion reactors yes that's a new thing
which is very interesting they can

804
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:09,760
which is very interesting they can
 

805
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,069
which is very interesting they can
suppress the instabilities in these

806
00:14:12,069 --> 00:14:12,079
suppress the instabilities in these
 

807
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,710
suppress the instabilities in these
tokamaks um better than any other way

808
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:14,720
tokamaks um better than any other way
 

809
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,750
tokamaks um better than any other way
yeah and it's just the march of progress

810
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:17,760
yeah and it's just the march of progress
 

811
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,150
yeah and it's just the march of progress
by ais and science

812
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:20,160
by ais and science
 

813
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,590
by ais and science
is

814
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:21,600
is
 

815
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,870
is
is making uh big strides do you think an

816
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:24,880
is making uh big strides do you think an
 

817
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,509
is making uh big strides do you think an
ai system will win a nobel prize in this

818
00:14:27,509 --> 00:14:27,519
ai system will win a nobel prize in this
 

819
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,590
ai system will win a nobel prize in this
century what do you think

820
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:31,600
century what do you think
 

821
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,790
century what do you think
does that make you sad if i can digress

822
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:34,800
does that make you sad if i can digress
 

823
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,870
does that make you sad if i can digress
and put in a plug for my next book yes

824
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:36,880
and put in a plug for my next book yes
 

825
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,350
and put in a plug for my next book yes
it has a chapter saying why nobel prizes

826
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:39,360
it has a chapter saying why nobel prizes
 

827
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,990
it has a chapter saying why nobel prizes
do more harm than good yes so

828
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:42,000
do more harm than good yes so
 

829
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,310
do more harm than good yes so

00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:51,360
one can

00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,389
one can
do simulations like that and

892
00:15:54,389 --> 00:15:54,399
do simulations like that and
 

893
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:55,910
do simulations like that and
the power of computers is such that

894
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:55,920
the power of computers is such that
 

895
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,949
the power of computers is such that
these simulations uh can

00:15:58,949 --> 00:15:58,959
these simulations uh can
 

897
00:15:58,959 --> 00:15:59,910
these simulations uh can
yield

00:15:59,910 --> 00:15:59,920
yield
 

899
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,269
yield
a phenomena

900
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:01,279
a phenomena
 

901
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,269
a phenomena
and insights which we wouldn't have

902
00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:03,279
and insights which we wouldn't have
 

903
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:06,550
and insights which we wouldn't have
guessed beforehand and the way we

904
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:06,560
guessed beforehand and the way we
 

905
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,470
guessed beforehand and the way we
can feel we're making progress and

906
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:08,480
can feel we're making progress and
 

907
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,150
can feel we're making progress and
trying to understand some of these

908
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:10,160
trying to understand some of these
 

909
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,910
trying to understand some of these
phenomena why galaxies have the size and

910
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:11,920
phenomena why galaxies have the size and
 

911
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,150
phenomena why galaxies have the size and
shape they do and all that is because we

912
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:14,160
shape they do and all that is because we
 

913
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,350
shape they do and all that is because we
can do simulations um tweaking different

914
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:17,360
can do simulations um tweaking different
 

915
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,389
can do simulations um tweaking different
initial conditions and seeing which

916
00:16:20,389 --> 00:16:20,399
initial conditions and seeing which
 

917
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:21,910
initial conditions and seeing which
gives the best fit to what we actually

918
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:21,920
gives the best fit to what we actually
 

919
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,910
gives the best fit to what we actually
observe and so that's

920
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:23,920
observe and so that's
 

921
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,990
observe and so that's
a way in which we've made progress

922
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:26,000
a way in which we've made progress
 

923
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,189
a way in which we've made progress
in using

924
00:16:27,189 --> 00:16:27,199
in using
 

925
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,069
in using
computers and incidentally uh we also

926
00:16:30,069 --> 00:16:30,079
computers and incidentally uh we also
 

927
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,230
computers and incidentally uh we also
now need them to analyze data because

928
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:32,240
now need them to analyze data because
 

929
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,829
now need them to analyze data because

00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:06,480
yeah well indeed because the reason they
 

963
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,630
yeah well indeed because the reason they
really have a benefit over us is that

964
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:08,640
really have a benefit over us is that
 

965
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,909
really have a benefit over us is that
they can

00:17:09,909 --> 00:17:09,919
they can
 

967
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,829
they can
learn and think so much faster that's

968
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:11,839
learn and think so much faster that's
 

969
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,870
learn and think so much faster that's
how they can learn to play chess and go

how they can learn to play chess and go
 

971
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,789
how they can learn to play chess and go
that's how they can learn to diagnose

972
00:17:16,789 --> 00:17:16,799
that's how they can learn to diagnose
 

973
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,189
that's how they can learn to diagnose
lung cancer better than the radiologist

lung cancer better than the radiologist
 

975
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:20,470
lung cancer better than the radiologist
because they can look at a hundred

for now what what's what is the new book
that you mentioned the book is called

998
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:42,240
that you mentioned the book is called
 

999
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,230
that you mentioned the book is called
if science is to save us it's coming out

1000
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:44,240
if science is to save us it's coming out
 

1001
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,590
if science is to save us it's coming out
in september

1002
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:45,600
in september
 

1003
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,630
in september
and it's on the um well

1004
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:48,640
and it's on the um well
 

1005
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,430
and it's on the um well
the big challenges of science um you

1006
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:51,440
the big challenges of science um you
 

1007
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,430
the big challenges of science um you
know um climate dealing with uh bio bio

1008
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:55,440
know um climate dealing with uh bio bio
 

1009
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,070
know um climate dealing with uh bio bio
safety and dealing with cyber safety and

1010
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:58,080
safety and dealing with cyber safety and
 

1011
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,430
safety and dealing with cyber safety and
also it's got chapters on the um uh way

1012
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:01,440
also it's got chapters on the um uh way
 

1013
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,190
also it's got chapters on the um uh way
science is organized you know

1014
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:03,200
science is organized you know
 

1015
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,950
science is organized you know
universities and academies et cetera

1016
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:04,960
universities and academies et cetera
 

1017
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,110
universities and academies et cetera
institutions and the the ethics of

1018
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:07,120
institutions and the the ethics of
 

1019
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,669
institutions and the the ethics of

1020
00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:09,679
science and um
 

1021
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,430
science and um
and perhaps

1022
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:11,440
and perhaps
 

1023
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,750
and perhaps
and the limits yes yeah well let me

1024
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:13,760
and the limits yes yeah well let me
 

1025
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,070
and the limits yes yeah well let me
actually just stroll around the the

1026
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:16,080
actually just stroll around the the
 

1027
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,669
actually just stroll around the the
beautiful and the strange of the

1028
00:18:17,669 --> 00:18:17,679
beautiful and the strange of the
 

1029
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,390
beautiful and the strange of the
universe uh over 20 years ago you

1030
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:20,400
universe uh over 20 years ago you
 

1031
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,390
universe uh over 20 years ago you
hypothesized that

1032
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:22,400
hypothesized that
 

1033
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,990
hypothesized that
we would solve the mystery of dark

1034
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:24,000
we would solve the mystery of dark
 

1035
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,750
we would solve the mystery of dark
matter by now

1036
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:25,760
matter by now
 

1037
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:30,230
matter by now
so unfortunately we didn't yet

1038
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:30,240

 

1039
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,789

first what is dark matter and

1040
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:32,799
first what is dark matter and
 

1041
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,110
first what is dark matter and
why has it been so tough to figure out

1042
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:35,120
why has it been so tough to figure out
 

1043
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,070
why has it been so tough to figure out
well i mean we learned that galaxies and

1044
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:38,080
well i mean we learned that galaxies and
 

1045
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,150
well i mean we learned that galaxies and
other large-scale structures

1046
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:40,160
other large-scale structures
 

1047
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,350
other large-scale structures
which are moving around but uh um

1048
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:43,360
which are moving around but uh um
 

1049
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,789
which are moving around but uh um
prevent them flying apart by by gravity

1050
00:18:46,789 --> 00:18:46,799
prevent them flying apart by by gravity
 

1051
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:50,070
prevent them flying apart by by gravity
um would be flying apart

1052
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:50,080
um would be flying apart
 

1053
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,870
um would be flying apart
if they only contain the stuff we see

1054
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:52,880
if they only contain the stuff we see
 

1055
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,029
if they only contain the stuff we see
if everything in them was shining

1056
00:18:55,029 --> 00:18:55,039
if everything in them was shining
 

1057
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:58,710
if everything in them was shining
and to understand how galaxies formed

1058
00:18:58,710 --> 00:18:58,720
and to understand how galaxies formed
 

1059
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,070
and to understand how galaxies formed
and why they

1060
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:00,080
and why they
 

1061
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,430
and why they
do remain confined the same size

1062
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:03,440
do remain confined the same size
 

1063
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,110
do remain confined the same size
one has to infer

1064
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:05,120
one has to infer
 

1065
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,710
one has to infer
that there's about five times as much

1066
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:06,720
that there's about five times as much
 

1067
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,909
that there's about five times as much
stuff

1068
00:19:07,909 --> 00:19:07,919
stuff
 

1069
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,350
stuff
producing gravitational forces than the

1070
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:11,360
producing gravitational forces than the
 

1071
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,110
producing gravitational forces than the
total amount of stuff in the gas and

1072
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:13,120
total amount of stuff in the gas and
 

1073
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,270
total amount of stuff in the gas and
stars that we see and that stuff is

1074
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:15,280
stars that we see and that stuff is
 

1075
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,029
stars that we see and that stuff is
called dark matter

1076
00:19:17,029 --> 00:19:17,039
called dark matter
 

1077
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,669
called dark matter
um that's his leading name it's not dark

1078
00:19:19,669 --> 00:19:19,679
um that's his leading name it's not dark
 

1079
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,110
um that's his leading name it's not dark
it's just transparent etc um and the uh

1080
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:23,120
it's just transparent etc um and the uh
 

1081
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,390
it's just transparent etc um and the uh
most likely

1082
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:24,400
most likely
 

1083
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,990
most likely
interpretation

1084
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:26,000
interpretation
 

1085
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,789
interpretation
is that it's a swarm of

1086
00:19:28,789 --> 00:19:28,799
is that it's a swarm of
 

1087
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,870
is that it's a swarm of
microscopic particles

1088
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:30,880
microscopic particles
 

1089
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,029
microscopic particles
which have no electric charge

1090
00:19:33,029 --> 00:19:33,039
which have no electric charge
 

1091
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,549
which have no electric charge
and the very small cross sections are

1092
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:34,559
and the very small cross sections are
 

1093
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,310
and the very small cross sections are
hitting each other and hitting anything

1094
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:36,320
hitting each other and hitting anything
 

1095
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,390
hitting each other and hitting anything
else so they swarm around

1096
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:38,400
else so they swarm around
 

1097
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,150
else so they swarm around
and we can detect their collective

1098
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:40,160
and we can detect their collective
 

1099
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,070
and we can detect their collective
effects and when we do computer

1100
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:42,080
effects and when we do computer
 

1101
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,470
effects and when we do computer
simulations of how galaxies form and

1102
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:44,480
simulations of how galaxies form and
 

1103
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,669
simulations of how galaxies form and
evolve

1104
00:19:45,669 --> 00:19:45,679
evolve
 

1105
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,990
evolve
and how they emerge from the big bang

1106
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:48,000
and how they emerge from the big bang
 

1107
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,870
and how they emerge from the big bang
then

1108
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:48,880
then
 

1109
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,430
then
we get a nice consistent picture

1110
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:51,440
we get a nice consistent picture
 

1111
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,669
we get a nice consistent picture
if we put in

1112
00:19:53,669 --> 00:19:53,679
if we put in
 

1113
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,190
if we put in
five times as much

1114
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:55,200
five times as much
 

1115
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,990
five times as much
mass in the form of these

1116
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:58,000
mass in the form of these
 

1117
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,870
mass in the form of these
mysterious dark particles and for

1118
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:00,880
mysterious dark particles and for
 

1119
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,710
mysterious dark particles and for
instance it works better if we think

1120
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:02,720
instance it works better if we think
 

1121
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,630
instance it works better if we think
they're non-interacting particles than

1122
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:04,640
they're non-interacting particles than
 

1123
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,909
they're non-interacting particles than
if you think they're a gas which would

1124
00:20:05,909 --> 00:20:05,919
if you think they're a gas which would
 

1125
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:07,669
if you think they're a gas which would
have shock waves and things so we know

1126
00:20:07,669 --> 00:20:07,679
have shock waves and things so we know
 

1127
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,510
have shock waves and things so we know
something about the properties of these

1128
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:09,520
something about the properties of these
 

1129
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,830
something about the properties of these
but we don't know what they are and um

1130
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:11,840
but we don't know what they are and um
 

1131
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,230
but we don't know what they are and um
the disappointment compared to my

1132
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:14,240
the disappointment compared to my
 

1133
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,110
the disappointment compared to my
guess 20 years ago um is that

1134
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:17,120
guess 20 years ago um is that
 

1135
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,950
guess 20 years ago um is that

hadron collider that cern was the
 

1143
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,110

world's biggest might have found a new

00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:27,120
world's biggest might have found a new
 

1145
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,029
world's biggest might have found a new
class of particles which would have been

1146
00:20:29,029 --> 00:20:29,039
class of particles which would have been
 

1147
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,909
class of particles which would have been
the obvious candidates and it hasn't

1148
00:20:31,909 --> 00:20:31,919
the obvious candidates and it hasn't
 

1149
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,669
the obvious candidates and it hasn't
and uh um

1150
00:20:33,669 --> 00:20:33,679
and uh um
 

1151
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,990
and uh um
some people say well dark matter can't

1152
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:36,000
some people say well dark matter can't
 

1153
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,310
some people say well dark matter can't
be there etc but what i would argue is

1154
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:38,320
be there etc but what i would argue is
 

1155
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,470
be there etc but what i would argue is
that there's a huge amount of

1156
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:40,480
that there's a huge amount of
 

1157
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,470
that there's a huge amount of
parameter space that hasn't been

1158
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:42,480
parameter space that hasn't been

wouldn't be able to text so easily so um
the fact that we've got new constraints

00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,470
one point which perhaps you'd like to
discuss more is about the

discuss more is about the
 

1227
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,470
discuss more is about the

very early stages of the big bang
 

1229
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,029
very early stages of the big bang
um and uh the situation now is that we

1230
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:01,039
um and uh the situation now is that we
 

1231
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:01,990
um and uh the situation now is that we
have a

1232
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:02,000
have a
 

1233
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,990

that's going to remain speculative so um

1328
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:43,440
that's going to remain speculative so um
 

1329
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,669
that's going to remain speculative so um
there's a big gap and to say how big the

there's a big gap and to say how big the
 

1331
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:48,230
there's a big gap and to say how big the
gap is um if we take the observable

1332
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:48,240
gap is um if we take the observable
 

1333
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,870

1337
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,549
billion light years um then when the
universe was a nanosecond old

1338

that would have been squeezed down to
 

1341
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,070
that would have been squeezed down to

microscopic so it's a huge extrapolation

1360
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:21,600
microscopic so it's a huge extrapolation
 

1361
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,990
microscopic so it's a huge extrapolation
and it's not surprising that

and it's not surprising that
 

1363
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,470
and it's not surprising that
since it's so far from our experimental

we are still groping for ideas

we are still groping for ideas
 

1369
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,950
we are still groping for ideas
but you think first theory will reach

00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:34,960
but you think first theory will reach
 

1371
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,830
but you think first theory will reach
into that place and then experiment will

1372
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:37,840
into that place and then experiment will
 

1373
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,390
into that place and then experiment will
perhaps one day catch up well i think

1374
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:40,400
perhaps one day catch up well i think
 

1375
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,310
perhaps one day catch up well i think
simulation in a sense it's a combination

i think

00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,029
i think
what we hope for

00:24:45,029 --> 00:24:45,039
what we hope for
 

1381
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:46,789
what we hope for
is that um

1382
00:24:46,789 --> 00:24:46,799
is that um
 

1383
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,390
is that um
there'll be a theory

1384
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:48,400
there'll be a theory
 

1385
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,430
there'll be a theory
which applies to the early universe

1386
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:51,440
which applies to the early universe
 

1387
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,070
which applies to the early universe
but which also has consequences which we

1388
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:54,080
but which also has consequences which we
 

1389
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,590
but which also has consequences which we
can test in our present day universe

1390
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:57,600
can test in our present day universe
 

1391
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,350
can test in our present day universe
like um

1392
00:24:59,350 --> 00:24:59,360
like um
 

1393
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,390
like um
discovering

1394
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:00,400

1395
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,710
discovering
my neutrinos exist or things like that

1396
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:02,720
my neutrinos exist or things like that
 

1397
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,149
my neutrinos exist or things like that
and that's the thing which

1398
00:25:04,149 --> 00:25:04,159
and that's the thing which
 

1399
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:06,710
and that's the thing which
as i mentioned we may perhaps need a bit

1400
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:06,720
as i mentioned we may perhaps need a bit
 

1401
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,870
as i mentioned we may perhaps need a bit
of ai to help us to calculate but yeah

1402
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:08,880
of ai to help us to calculate but yeah
 

1403
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,750
of ai to help us to calculate but yeah
but i think um the hope would be

1404
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:11,760
but i think um the hope would be
 

1405
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,350
but i think um the hope would be
that we will have a theory which applies

1406
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:15,360
that we will have a theory which applies
 

1407
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,110
that we will have a theory which applies
under the very very extreme early stage

1408
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:17,120
under the very very extreme early stage
 

1409
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,789
under the very very extreme early stage
of the universe but which gains

1410
00:25:18,789 --> 00:25:18,799
of the universe but which gains
 

1411
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:21,029
of the universe but which gains
credibility and gains confidence because

1412
00:25:21,029 --> 00:25:21,039
credibility and gains confidence because
 

1413
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:23,510
credibility and gains confidence because
it also manages to account for otherwise

1414
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:23,520
it also manages to account for otherwise

00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,990
it also manages to account for otherwise
unexplained features of

00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:26,000
unexplained features of
 

1417
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,669
unexplained features of
the low energy world of what people call

1418
00:25:27,669 --> 00:25:27,679
the low energy world of what people call
 

1419
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:29,990
the low energy world of what people call
the standard model of particle physics

1420
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:30,000
the standard model of particle physics
 

1421
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,669
the standard model of particle physics
where there are lots of undetermined

1422
00:25:31,669 --> 00:25:31,679
where there are lots of undetermined
 

1423
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:35,029
where there are lots of undetermined
numbers so it may help with that

1424
00:25:35,029 --> 00:25:35,039
numbers so it may help with that
 

1425
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,190
numbers so it may help with that
so we're dancing between physics and

1426
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:37,200
so we're dancing between physics and
 

1427
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,110
so we're dancing between physics and
philosophy a little bit but what do you

1428
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:39,120
philosophy a little bit but what do you
 

1429
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,190
philosophy a little bit but what do you
think

1430
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:41,200
think
 

1431
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,630
think
what do you think happened before the

1432
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:42,640
what do you think happened before the
 

1433
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,230
what do you think happened before the
big bang

1434
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:44,240
big bang
 

1435
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,230
big bang
so this seems this feels like something

1436
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:46,240
so this seems this feels like something
 

1437
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,310
so this seems this feels like something
that's out of the reach of science

1438
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:48,320
that's out of the reach of science
 

1439
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,149
that's out of the reach of science
it's out of the reach of present science

1440
00:25:50,149 --> 00:25:50,159
it's out of the reach of present science
 

1441
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,390
it's out of the reach of present science
because science develops and

1442
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:52,400
because science develops and
 

1443
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,630
because science develops and
as the front is advanced

1444
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:54,640
as the front is advanced
 

1445
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,630
as the front is advanced
then new problems come into focus that

1446
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:56,640
then new problems come into focus that
 

1447
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,830
then new problems come into focus that
couldn't even have been postulated

1448
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:57,840
couldn't even have been postulated
 

1449
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,590
couldn't even have been postulated
before i mean if i think of my own

1450
00:25:59,590 --> 00:25:59,600
before i mean if i think of my own
 

1451
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,230
before i mean if i think of my own
career when i was a student

1452
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:02,240
career when i was a student
 

1453
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,630
career when i was a student
the evidence for the big bang

1454
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:04,640
the evidence for the big bang
 

1455
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,549
the evidence for the big bang
was pretty weak whereas now it's

1456
00:26:06,549 --> 00:26:06,559
was pretty weak whereas now it's
 

1457
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:08,149
was pretty weak whereas now it's
extremely strong

1458
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:08,159
extremely strong
 

1459
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,350
extremely strong
but we are now thinking about the

1460
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:11,360
but we are now thinking about the
 

1461
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,190
but we are now thinking about the
reason why the universe is the way it is

1462
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:13,200
reason why the universe is the way it is
 

1463
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,870
reason why the universe is the way it is
and all that um so uh i i would put all

1464
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:16,880
and all that um so uh i i would put all
 

1465
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,350
and all that um so uh i i would put all
these things we've just mentioned in the

1466
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:19,360
these things we've just mentioned in the
 

1467
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,669
these things we've just mentioned in the
category of speculative science

1468
00:26:21,669 --> 00:26:21,679
category of speculative science
 

1469
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:24,390
category of speculative science
um and i don't see a bifurcation between

1470
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:24,400
um and i don't see a bifurcation between
 

1471
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,870
um and i don't see a bifurcation between
that and philosophy um but of course to

1472
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:26,880
that and philosophy um but of course to
 

1473
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,190
that and philosophy um but of course to
answer your question um

1474
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:29,200
answer your question um
 

1475
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,950
answer your question um
if we do want to understand the very

1476
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:30,960
if we do want to understand the very
 

1477
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,269
if we do want to understand the very
early universe then we've got to realize

1478
00:26:33,269 --> 00:26:33,279
early universe then we've got to realize
 

1479
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:34,070
early universe then we've got to realize
that

1480
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:34,080
that

that
it may involve even more

1482
00:26:35,549 --> 00:26:35,559
it may involve even more
 

1483
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:38,470
it may involve even more
counterintuitive concepts than quantum

1484
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:38,480
counterintuitive concepts than quantum
 

1485
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,669
counterintuitive concepts than quantum
theory does

1486
00:26:39,669 --> 00:26:39,679
theory does
 

1487
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:41,830
theory does
because it's a condition even further

1488
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:41,840
because it's a condition even further
 

1489
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,149
because it's a condition even further

00:26:44,149 --> 00:26:44,159
away from everyday
 

1491
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,230
away from everyday
world than quantum theory is and

00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:46,240
world than quantum theory is and

00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,149
world than quantum theory is and
remember our lives

1494
00:26:48,149 --> 00:26:48,159
remember our lives
 

1495
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:49,430
remember our lives
our brains

1496
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:49,440
our brains
 

1497
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,630
our brains
evolved

1498
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:50,640
evolved
 

1499
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,630
evolved
and haven't changed much since

1500
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:52,640
and haven't changed much since

our ancestors roamed the african

1502
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:54,320
our ancestors roamed the african
 

1503
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,070
our ancestors roamed the african
savannah and looked at the everyday

1504
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:56,080
savannah and looked at the everyday
 

1505
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,870
savannah and looked at the everyday
world um and uh it's rather amazing that

1506
00:26:58,870 --> 00:26:58,880
world um and uh it's rather amazing that
 

1507
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,310
world um and uh it's rather amazing that
we've been able to make some sense of

1508
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:00,320
we've been able to make some sense of
 

1509
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,149
we've been able to make some sense of
the quantum micro world and of the

1510
00:27:02,149 --> 00:27:02,159
the quantum micro world and of the
 

1511
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:03,990
the quantum micro world and of the
cosmos but uh

1512
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:04,000
cosmos but uh
 

1513
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,430
cosmos but uh
there may be some things which are

1514
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:05,440
there may be some things which are
 

1515
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,350
there may be some things which are
beyond us and certainly as we implied

1516
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:07,360
beyond us and certainly as we implied
 

1517
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,950
beyond us and certainly as we implied
they're things that we don't yet

1518
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:08,960
they're things that we don't yet
 

1519
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,990
they're things that we don't yet
understand at all and of course one

1520
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:12,000
understand at all and of course one
 

1521
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,230
understand at all and of course one
concept we might have to jettison

1522
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:14,240
concept we might have to jettison
 

1523
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,110
concept we might have to jettison
is the idea of three dimensions of space

1524
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:17,120
is the idea of three dimensions of space
 

1525
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,830
is the idea of three dimensions of space
and time just ticking

1526
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:18,840
and time just ticking
 

1527
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,630
and time just ticking
away a lot of ideas i mean i think

1528
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:22,640
away a lot of ideas i mean i think
 

1529
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,630
away a lot of ideas i mean i think
stephen hawking had an idea that talking

1530
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:24,640
stephen hawking had an idea that talking
 

1531
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,590
stephen hawking had an idea that talking
about

1532
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:25,600
about
 

1533
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,950
about
what's

1534
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:26,960
what's
 

1535
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,950
what's
what happened before the big bang it's

1536
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:28,960
what happened before the big bang it's
 

1537
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,789
what happened before the big bang it's
like asking what happens if you go north

1538
00:27:30,789 --> 00:27:30,799
like asking what happens if you go north
 

1539
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:33,110
like asking what happens if you go north
from the north pole you know it somehow

1540
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:33,120
from the north pole you know it somehow
 

1541
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,269
from the north pole you know it somehow
closes off that's just one idea

1542
00:27:35,269 --> 00:27:35,279
closes off that's just one idea
 

1543
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,029
closes off that's just one idea
um i don't like that idea but that's a

1544
00:27:37,029 --> 00:27:37,039
um i don't like that idea but that's a
 

1545
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:39,430
um i don't like that idea but that's a
possible one um and uh

1546
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:39,440
possible one um and uh
 

1547
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,870
possible one um and uh
and so we just don't know um

1548
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:42,880
and so we just don't know um
 

1549
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,230
and so we just don't know um
what happened at the very beginning of

1550
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:44,240
what happened at the very beginning of
 

1551
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,430
what happened at the very beginning of
the big bang

1552
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:45,440
the big bang
 

1553
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,029
the big bang
were there many big bangs rather than

1554
00:27:47,029 --> 00:27:47,039
were there many big bangs rather than
 

1555
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,710
were there many big bangs rather than
one etc

1556
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:48,720
one etc
 

1557
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,510
one etc
and

1558
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:49,520
and
 

1559
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,230
and
those are issues which

1560
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:52,240
those are issues which
 

1561
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,830
those are issues which
we may be able to

1562
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:53,840
we may be able to
 

1563
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,830
we may be able to
get some

1564
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:55,840
get some
 

1565
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,110
get some
foothold on

1566
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:57,120
foothold on
 

1567
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,669
foothold on
from some new theory

1568
00:27:59,669 --> 00:27:59,679
from some new theory
 

1569
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:01,190
from some new theory
but

1570
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:01,200
but
 

1571
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,590
but
even then um we won't be able to

1572
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:03,600
even then um we won't be able to
 

1573
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,070
even then um we won't be able to
directly test the theories but i think

1574
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:06,080
directly test the theories but i think
 

1575
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:06,870
directly test the theories but i think
um

1576
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:06,880
um
 

1577
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,549
um
it's a heritage i think you have to be

1578
00:28:08,549 --> 00:28:08,559
it's a heritage i think you have to be
 

1579
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:11,110
it's a heritage i think you have to be
able to test every prediction of a

1580
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:11,120
able to test every prediction of a
 

1581
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,190
able to test every prediction of a
theory let me give you another example

1582
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:13,200
theory let me give you another example
 

1583
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,070
theory let me give you another example
um

1584
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:14,080
um
 

1585
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,710
um
we take seriously what einstein's theory

1586
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:16,720
we take seriously what einstein's theory
 

1587
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,430
we take seriously what einstein's theory
says about the inside of black holes

1588
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:19,440
says about the inside of black holes
 

1589
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,029
says about the inside of black holes
even though we can't observe them

1590
00:28:21,029 --> 00:28:21,039
even though we can't observe them
 

1591
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:22,389
even though we can't observe them
because

1592
00:28:22,389 --> 00:28:22,399
because
 

1593
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:24,070
because
that theory has been vindicated in many

1594
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:24,080
that theory has been vindicated in many
 

1595
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,430
that theory has been vindicated in many
other places

1596
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:25,440
other places
 

1597
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,590
other places
in cosmology and black holes

1598
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:27,600
in cosmology and black holes
 

1599
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,990
in cosmology and black holes
gravitational waves and all those things

1600
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:30,000
gravitational waves and all those things
 

1601
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,470
gravitational waves and all those things
likewise if we had a theory

1602
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:32,480
likewise if we had a theory
 

1603
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,830
likewise if we had a theory
which

1604
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:33,840
which
 

1605
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,909
which
explains some things about the early

1606
00:28:35,909 --> 00:28:35,919
explains some things about the early
 

1607
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:37,430
explains some things about the early
history of our big bang and the present

1608
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:37,440
history of our big bang and the present
 

1609
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,549
history of our big bang and the present
universe

1610
00:28:38,549 --> 00:28:38,559
universe
 

1611
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:42,470
universe
then we would take seriously

1612
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:42,480

 

1613
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,549

the inference if it predicted many big

1614
00:28:44,549 --> 00:28:44,559
the inference if it predicted many big
 

1615
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:45,990
the inference if it predicted many big
bangs not one even though we can't

1616
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:46,000
bangs not one even though we can't
 

1617
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,549
bangs not one even though we can't
predict the other ones so the example is

1618
00:28:48,549 --> 00:28:48,559
predict the other ones so the example is
 

1619
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:51,029
predict the other ones so the example is
that we can uh take seriously a

1620
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:51,039
that we can uh take seriously a
 

1621
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:52,310
that we can uh take seriously a
prediction

1622
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:52,320
prediction
 

1623
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,909
prediction
if it's the consequence of a theory that

1624
00:28:53,909 --> 00:28:53,919
if it's the consequence of a theory that
 

1625
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:56,470
if it's the consequence of a theory that
we believe on other grounds we don't

1626
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:56,480
we believe on other grounds we don't
 

1627
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,269
we believe on other grounds we don't
need to be able to uh detect

1628
00:28:59,269 --> 00:28:59,279
need to be able to uh detect
 

1629
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,870
need to be able to uh detect
another big bang in order to take it

1630
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:00,880
another big bang in order to take it
 

1631
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,590
another big bang in order to take it
seriously it may not be a proof

1632
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:03,600
seriously it may not be a proof
 

1633
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,950
seriously it may not be a proof
but it's a good indication that uh

1634
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:06,960
but it's a good indication that uh
 

1635
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,029
but it's a good indication that uh
this is the direction where the truth

1636
00:29:09,029 --> 00:29:09,039
this is the direction where the truth
 

1637
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:11,029
this is the direction where the truth
lies yeah if the theory is gain

1638
00:29:11,029 --> 00:29:11,039
lies yeah if the theory is gain
 

1639
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:13,269
lies yeah if the theory is gain
confidence in other ways yes

1640
00:29:13,269 --> 00:29:13,279
confidence in other ways yes
 

1641
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,430
confidence in other ways yes
where do you sense do you think there's

1642
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:15,440
where do you sense do you think there's
 

1643
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,870
where do you sense do you think there's
other universes

1644
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:16,880

that's based on specific assumptions

00:29:53,269 --> 00:29:53,279
that's based on specific assumptions
 

1675
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,269
that's based on specific assumptions
about the physics but those assumptions

1676
00:29:55,269 --> 00:29:55,279
about the physics but those assumptions
 

1677
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:57,350
about the physics but those assumptions
of course are just hypotheses which

1678
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:57,360
of course are just hypotheses which
 

1679
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,909
of course are just hypotheses which
aren't vindicated but there are other

1680
00:29:59,909 --> 00:29:59,919
aren't vindicated but there are other
 

1681
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:01,190
aren't vindicated but there are other
theories which

1682
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:01,200
theories which
 

1683
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,909
theories which
only predict one big bang so i think

1684
00:30:03,909 --> 00:30:03,919
only predict one big bang so i think
 

1685
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:05,830
only predict one big bang so i think
we should be open-minded and not

1686
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:05,840
we should be open-minded and not
 

1687
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,870
we should be open-minded and not
dogmatic about these these options until

1688
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:08,880
dogmatic about these these options until
 

1689
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,710
dogmatic about these these options until
we do understand the relevant physics

1690
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:10,720
we do understand the relevant physics
 

1691
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,590
we do understand the relevant physics
but there are these different scenarios

1692
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:13,600
but there are these different scenarios
 

1693
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,590
but there are these different scenarios
are very different ideas about

1694
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:15,600
are very different ideas about
 

1695
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,350
are very different ideas about
about this but i think all of them have

1696
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:17,360
about this but i think all of them have
 

1697
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,470
about this but i think all of them have
the

00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:27,520
conservative astronomers would say that
 

1709
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,549
conservative astronomers would say that
because

1710
00:30:28,549 --> 00:30:28,559
because
 

1711
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:31,269
because
we can see out with our telescopes to a

we can see out with our telescopes to a
 

1713
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:32,950
we can see out with our telescopes to a
sort of horizon

00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:32,960
sort of horizon
 

1715
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,110
sort of horizon
which is about

is no more physical reality
 

1727
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,830
is no more physical reality
than the horizon around you if you're in

and look at looking out at

00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:51,600
and look at looking out at
 

1733
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,990
and look at looking out at
your horizon there's no reason to think

your horizon there's no reason to think
 

1735
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,430
your horizon there's no reason to think

00:30:59,350 --> 00:30:59,360
to think that
 

1741
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,070
to think that
the aftermath of our big bang

00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:02,080
the aftermath of our big bang
 

1743

the aftermath of our big bang
ends

1745
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,750
ends
just

1746
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:03,760
just
 

1747
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,590
just
at the boundary what we can see indeed

1748
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:05,600
at the boundary what we can see indeed
 

1749
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,430
at the boundary what we can see indeed
they're quite strong arguments

1750
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:07,440
they're quite strong arguments
 

1751
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,430
they're quite strong arguments
um that it probably goes on about 100

1752
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:09,440
um that it probably goes on about 100
 

1753
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,789
um that it probably goes on about 100
times further

1754
00:31:10,789 --> 00:31:10,799
times further
 

1755
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:13,269
times further
they may even go on so much further

1756
00:31:13,269 --> 00:31:13,279
they may even go on so much further
 

1757
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:15,909
they may even go on so much further
that uh all combinatorials are

1758
00:31:15,909 --> 00:31:15,919
that uh all combinatorials are
 

1759
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:17,350
that uh all combinatorials are
replicated and

1760
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:17,360
replicated and
 

1761
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,190
replicated and
there's another set of people like us

1762
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:19,200
there's another set of people like us
 

1763
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,110
there's another set of people like us
sitting in a in a room like this every

1764
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:21,120
sitting in a in a room like this every
 

1765
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,110
sitting in a in a room like this every
possible combination of yeah

1766
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:23,120
possible combination of yeah
 

1767
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,950
possible combination of yeah
that could happen

1768
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:24,960
that could happen
 

1769
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,190
that could happen
well that's not logically impossible um

1770
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:27,200
well that's not logically impossible um
 

1771
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,590
well that's not logically impossible um
but but i think many people would accept

1772
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:29,600
but but i think many people would accept
 

1773
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,509
but but i think many people would accept
that it does go on

1774
00:31:31,509 --> 00:31:31,519
that it does go on
 

1775
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:34,070
that it does go on
and contain

1776
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:34,080
and contain
 

1777
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,909
and contain
probably a million times as much stuff

1778
00:31:35,909 --> 00:31:35,919
probably a million times as much stuff
 

1779
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:38,470
probably a million times as much stuff
as what we can see within the horizon

1780
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:38,480
as what we can see within the horizon
 

1781
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,870
as what we can see within the horizon
the reason for that incidentally is that

1782
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:40,880
the reason for that incidentally is that
 

1783
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,389
the reason for that incidentally is that
if we look as far as we can in one

1784
00:31:42,389 --> 00:31:42,399
if we look as far as we can in one
 

1785
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:44,950
if we look as far as we can in one
direction and in the opposite direction

1786
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:44,960
direction and in the opposite direction
 

1787
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,350
direction and in the opposite direction
then the conditions don't differ by more

1788
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:47,360
then the conditions don't differ by more
 

1789
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,269
then the conditions don't differ by more
than one part in a hundred thousand so

1790
00:31:49,269 --> 00:31:49,279
than one part in a hundred thousand so
 

1791
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:50,950
than one part in a hundred thousand so
that means that if we're part of some

1792
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:50,960
that means that if we're part of some
 

1793
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,789
that means that if we're part of some
finite structure

1794
00:31:52,789 --> 00:31:52,799
finite structure
 

1795
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,870
finite structure
the gradient across the part we can see

1796
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:54,880
the gradient across the part we can see
 

1797
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,950
the gradient across the part we can see
is very small and so that suggests that

1798
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:56,960
is very small and so that suggests that
 

1799
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,070
is very small and so that suggests that
it probably does go on a lot further and

1800
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:00,080
it probably does go on a lot further and
 

1801
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,669
it probably does go on a lot further and
the best estimates say it must go on at

1802
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:01,679
the best estimates say it must go on at
 

1803
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,990
the best estimates say it must go on at
least 20 times further

1804
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:04,000
least 20 times further
 

1805
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,269
least 20 times further
is that

1806
00:32:05,269 --> 00:32:05,279
is that
 

1807
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:08,149
is that
exciting or terrifying to you just the

1808
00:32:08,149 --> 00:32:08,159
exciting or terrifying to you just the
 

1809
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:11,509
exciting or terrifying to you just the
spans of it all the wide

1810
00:32:11,509 --> 00:32:11,519
spans of it all the wide
 

1811
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:15,190
spans of it all the wide
everything that lies beyond the horizon

1812
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:15,200
everything that lies beyond the horizon
 

1813
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,870
everything that lies beyond the horizon
that that example doesn't even hold for

1814
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:16,880
that that example doesn't even hold for
 

1815
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,269
that that example doesn't even hold for
earth so it goes way way farther and on

1816
00:32:19,269 --> 00:32:19,279
earth so it goes way way farther and on
 

1817
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:21,430
earth so it goes way way farther and on
top of that just to take your metaphor

1818
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:21,440
top of that just to take your metaphor
 

1819
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,549
top of that just to take your metaphor
further with the on the ocean yeah while

1820
00:32:24,549 --> 00:32:24,559
further with the on the ocean yeah while
 

1821
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:26,470
further with the on the ocean yeah while
we're on top of this ocean

1822
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:26,480
we're on top of this ocean
 

1823
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,990
we're on top of this ocean
not only can we not see beyond the

1824
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:28,000
not only can we not see beyond the
 

1825
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,190
not only can we not see beyond the
horizon

1826
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:29,200
horizon
 

1827
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,590
horizon
we also don't know much about the depth

1828
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:31,600
we also don't know much about the depth
 

1829
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,669
we also don't know much about the depth
of the ocean

1830
00:32:33,669 --> 00:32:33,679
of the ocean
 

1831
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:36,230

00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,630

that's in our head yes

1834
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:38,640
that's in our head yes
 

1835
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,230
that's in our head yes
no i think there's another is all those

1836
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:40,240
no i think there's another is all those
 

1837
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,870
no i think there's another is all those
points you make yes yes but but i think

1838
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:42,880
points you make yes yes but but i think
 

1839
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,750
points you make yes yes but but i think
um

1840
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:45,760

 

1841
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,669

even the solar system is pretty vast by

1842
00:32:47,669 --> 00:32:47,679
even the solar system is pretty vast by
 

1843
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:51,909
even the solar system is pretty vast by
human standards and so uh i don't think

1844
00:32:51,909 --> 00:32:51,919
human standards and so uh i don't think
 

1845
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:54,470
human standards and so uh i don't think
the perception of this utterly vast

1846
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:54,480
the perception of this utterly vast
 

1847
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,630
the perception of this utterly vast

1849
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,310

need have any

1850
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:58,320
need have any
 

1851
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,549
need have any
deeper impact on us than just realizing

1852
00:33:00,549 --> 00:33:00,559
deeper impact on us than just realizing
 

1853
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:01,669
deeper impact on us than just realizing
that we are

1854
00:33:01,669 --> 00:33:01,679
that we are
 

1855
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,669
that we are
very small on the scale of the external

1856
00:33:03,669 --> 00:33:03,679
very small on the scale of the external
 

1857
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:05,110
very small on the scale of the external
world

world
 

1859
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,230
world
yeah

1860
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:06,240
yeah
 

1861
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,070
yeah
it's humbling though

1862
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:08,080
it's humbling though
 

1863
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,029
it's humbling though
it's it's humbling in in uh depending

1864
00:33:11,029 --> 00:33:11,039
it's it's humbling in in uh depending
 

1865
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:13,590
it's it's humbling in in uh depending
where your ego is it's humbling and well

1866
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:13,600
where your ego is it's humbling and well
 

1867
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,750
where your ego is it's humbling and well
if you could be very unhumble indeed it

1868
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:15,760
if you could be very unhumble indeed it
 

1869
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,750
if you could be very unhumble indeed it
may make a difference but for most of us

1870
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:17,760
may make a difference but for most of us
 

1871
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,950
may make a difference but for most of us
i don't think it might be

1872
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:18,960
i don't think it might be
 

1873
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,269
i don't think it might be
much difference and uh well there's a

1874
00:33:21,269 --> 00:33:21,279
much difference and uh well there's a
 

1875
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:24,230
much difference and uh well there's a
more general question of course about

1876
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:24,240
more general question of course about
 

1877
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,070
more general question of course about
whether um the human race as such

1878
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:28,080
whether um the human race as such
 

1879
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,549
whether um the human race as such
is something which is

1880
00:33:30,549 --> 00:33:30,559
is something which is
 

1881
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:32,149
is something which is
very special

1882
00:33:32,149 --> 00:33:32,159
very special
 

1883
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:35,110
very special
or if on the other hand um it's just one

1884
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:35,120
or if on the other hand um it's just one
 

1885
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,070
or if on the other hand um it's just one
of

1886
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:36,080
of
 

1887
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,909
of
many such species elsewhere in the

1888
00:33:39,909 --> 00:33:39,919
many such species elsewhere in the
 

1889
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:42,070
many such species elsewhere in the
universe or indeed existing at different

1890
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:42,080
universe or indeed existing at different
 

1891
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,630
universe or indeed existing at different
times in our universe

1892
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:44,640
times in our universe
 

1893
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,389
times in our universe
it to me it feels

1894
00:33:46,389 --> 00:33:46,399
it to me it feels
 

1895
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:47,350
it to me it feels
uh

1896
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:47,360
uh
 

1897
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,029
uh
almost obvious that the universe should

1898
00:33:49,029 --> 00:33:49,039
almost obvious that the universe should
 

1899
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:51,350
almost obvious that the universe should
be full of alien life

1900
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:51,360
be full of alien life
 

1901
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,470
be full of alien life
perhaps dead alien civilizations but

1902
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:54,480
perhaps dead alien civilizations but
 

1903
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,269
perhaps dead alien civilizations but
just

1904
00:33:55,269 --> 00:33:55,279
just
 

1905
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:58,070
just
the the vastness of space

1906
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:58,080
the the vastness of space
 

1907
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,110
the the vastness of space
and

1908
00:33:59,110 --> 00:33:59,120
and
 

1909
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,789
and
it just feels

1910
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:00,799
it just feels
 

1911
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:01,990
it just feels
wrong

1912
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:02,000
wrong
 

1913
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,149
wrong
to think of earth as somehow special it

1914
00:34:04,149 --> 00:34:04,159
to think of earth as somehow special it
 

1915
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:06,149
to think of earth as somehow special it
sure as heck doesn't look that special

1916
00:34:06,149 --> 00:34:06,159
sure as heck doesn't look that special
 

1917
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:08,629
sure as heck doesn't look that special
when you the more we learn the less

1918
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:08,639
when you the more we learn the less
 

1919
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,230
when you the more we learn the less
special it seems

1920
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:10,240
special it seems
 

1921
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,389
special it seems
well i mean i don't agree with that as

1922
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:12,399
well i mean i don't agree with that as
 

1923
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:15,909
well i mean i don't agree with that as
far as life is concerned because uh

1924
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:15,919
far as life is concerned because uh
 

1925
00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:17,669
far as life is concerned because uh
remember that we don't understand how

1926
00:34:17,669 --> 00:34:17,679
remember that we don't understand how
 

1927
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,909
remember that we don't understand how
life began here on earth yes we don't

1928
00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:19,919
life began here on earth yes we don't
 

1929
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:21,510
life began here on earth yes we don't
understand

1930
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:21,520
understand
 

1931
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,790
understand
although we know there are any evolution

1932
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:22,800
although we know there are any evolution
 

1933
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,950
although we know there are any evolution
of simple life to complex life we don't

1934
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:24,960
of simple life to complex life we don't
 

1935
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,149
of simple life to complex life we don't
understand uh what caused the transition

1936
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:28,159
understand uh what caused the transition
 

1937
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:31,750
understand uh what caused the transition
between complex chemistry and the first

1938
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:31,760
between complex chemistry and the first
 

1939
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,470
between complex chemistry and the first
replicating metabolizing entity we call

1940
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:34,480
replicating metabolizing entity we call
 

1941
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,950
replicating metabolizing entity we call
alive yes that's a mystery um and uh

1942
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:38,960
alive yes that's a mystery um and uh
 

1943
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,629
alive yes that's a mystery um and uh
serious physicists

1944
00:34:40,629 --> 00:34:40,639
serious physicists
 

1945
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:42,710
serious physicists
and chemists are now thinking about it

1946
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:42,720
and chemists are now thinking about it
 

1947
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,550
and chemists are now thinking about it
but we that we don't know so we

1948
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:44,560
but we that we don't know so we
 

1949
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,510
but we that we don't know so we
therefore can't say was it a rare fluke

1950
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:47,520
therefore can't say was it a rare fluke
 

1951
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,389
therefore can't say was it a rare fluke
yeah which would not have happened

1952
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:50,399
yeah which would not have happened
 

1953
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:53,109
yeah which would not have happened
anywhere else or was it something which

1954
00:34:53,109 --> 00:34:53,119
anywhere else or was it something which
 

1955
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:55,030
anywhere else or was it something which
uh involves the processes would have

1956
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:55,040
uh involves the processes would have
 

1957
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,829
uh involves the processes would have
happened in any other planet where

1958
00:34:57,829 --> 00:34:57,839
happened in any other planet where
 

1959
00:34:57,839 --> 00:34:59,190
happened in any other planet where
conditions were like they were on the

1960
00:34:59,190 --> 00:34:59,200
conditions were like they were on the
 

1961
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,230
conditions were like they were on the
young earth

1962
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:00,240
young earth
 

1963
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,829
young earth
um so we can't say that now um

1964
00:35:03,829 --> 00:35:03,839
um so we can't say that now um
 

1965
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:04,870
um so we can't say that now um
i think

1966
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:04,880
i think
 

1967
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,710
i think
many of us would indeed bet

1968
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:06,720
many of us would indeed bet
 

1969
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,069
many of us would indeed bet
that probably

1970
00:35:08,069 --> 00:35:08,079
that probably
 

1971
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:10,390
that probably
some kind of life exists elsewhere but

1972
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:10,400
some kind of life exists elsewhere but
 

1973
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,670
some kind of life exists elsewhere but
even if um you accept that then um there

1974
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:13,680
even if um you accept that then um there
 

1975
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,589
even if um you accept that then um there
are many contingencies going from simple

1976
00:35:15,589 --> 00:35:15,599
are many contingencies going from simple
 

1977
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:17,430
are many contingencies going from simple
life to

1978
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:17,440
life to
 

1979
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,990
life to
present day life and some

1980
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:20,000
present day life and some
 

1981
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,390
present day life and some
biologists like stephen j gould

1982
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:22,400
biologists like stephen j gould
 

1983
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,710
biologists like stephen j gould
thought that if you reround evolution

1984
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:24,720
thought that if you reround evolution
 

1985
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,829
thought that if you reround evolution
you'd end up with something quite

1986
00:35:25,829 --> 00:35:25,839
you'd end up with something quite
 

1987
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:26,710
you'd end up with something quite
different

1988
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:26,720
different
 

1989
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,910
different
and maybe not with an intelligent

1990
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:27,920
and maybe not with an intelligent
 

1991
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,910
and maybe not with an intelligent
species so the contingencies in

1992
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:29,920
species so the contingencies in
 

1993
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,430
species so the contingencies in
evolution

1994
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:31,440
evolution
 

1995
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,630

may

1996
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:32,640
may
 

1997
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,230
may
militate against the emergence of

00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:34,240
militate against the emergence of
 

1999
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,109
militate against the emergence of
intelligence even if life gets started

2000
00:35:37,109 --> 00:35:37,119
intelligence even if life gets started
 

2001
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:38,790
intelligence even if life gets started
in lots of places so i think these are

2002
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:38,800
in lots of places so i think these are
 

2003
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,390
in lots of places so i think these are
still completely open questions and

2004
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:40,400
still completely open questions and
 

2005
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,069
still completely open questions and
that's why it's such an exciting time

2006
00:35:42,069 --> 00:35:42,079
that's why it's such an exciting time
 

2007
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:42,950
that's why it's such an exciting time
now

2008
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:42,960
now
 

2009
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,310
now
that we are starting to be able to

2010
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:44,320
that we are starting to be able to
 

2011
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,550
that we are starting to be able to
address these i mean i mentioned the uh

2012
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:46,560
address these i mean i mentioned the uh
 

2013
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,950
address these i mean i mentioned the uh
the fact that the origin of life

2014
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:48,960
the fact that the origin of life
 

2015
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,030
the fact that the origin of life
is a question that we may be able to

2016
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:51,040
is a question that we may be able to
 

2017
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,589
is a question that we may be able to
understand um and serious people are

2018
00:35:53,589 --> 00:35:53,599
understand um and serious people are
 

2019
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:55,190
understand um and serious people are
working on it it's usually put in the

2020
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:55,200
working on it it's usually put in the
 

2021
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,790
working on it it's usually put in the
sort of too difficult box everyone knew

2022
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:56,800
sort of too difficult box everyone knew
 

2023
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,550
sort of too difficult box everyone knew
was important but they didn't know how

2024
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:58,560
was important but they didn't know how
 

2025
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,390
was important but they didn't know how
to tackle it or what exposed to do but

2026
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:00,400
to tackle it or what exposed to do but
 

2027
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,069
to tackle it or what exposed to do but
it's not like that now

2028
00:36:02,069 --> 00:36:02,079
it's not like that now
 

2029
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:04,310
it's not like that now
and um that's partly because of clever

2030
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:04,320
and um that's partly because of clever
 

2031
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,950
and um that's partly because of clever
experiments but i think most importantly

2032
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:06,960
experiments but i think most importantly
 

2033
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,069
experiments but i think most importantly
because um we are aware that we can look

2034
00:36:10,069 --> 00:36:10,079
because um we are aware that we can look
 

2035
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:13,030
because um we are aware that we can look
for life in other places other places in

2036
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:13,040
for life in other places other places in
 

2037
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,510
for life in other places other places in
our solar system and of course on the

2038
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:15,520
our solar system and of course on the
 

2039
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,470
our solar system and of course on the
exoplanets around other stars and uh

2040
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:18,480
exoplanets around other stars and uh
 

2041
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,790
exoplanets around other stars and uh
within 10 or 20 years

2042
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:20,800
within 10 or 20 years
 

2043
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,790
within 10 or 20 years
i think two things could happen which

2044
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:22,800
i think two things could happen which
 

2045
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,870
i think two things could happen which
would be really really important

2046
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:24,880
would be really really important
 

2047
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,630
would be really really important
we might with the next big telescope

2048
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:28,640
we might with the next big telescope
 

2049
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,510
we might with the next big telescope
be able to image some of the earth-like

2050
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:31,520
be able to image some of the earth-like
 

2051
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,069
be able to image some of the earth-like
planets around other stars

2052
00:36:34,069 --> 00:36:34,079
planets around other stars
 

2053
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:37,030
planets around other stars
image right get a picture well actually

2054
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:37,040
image right get a picture well actually
 

2055
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,589
image right get a picture well actually
let me caveat that it take 50 years to

2056
00:36:39,589 --> 00:36:39,599
let me caveat that it take 50 years to
 

2057
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:42,230
let me caveat that it take 50 years to
get a resolved image but but try to

2058
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:42,240
get a resolved image but but try to
 

2059
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,270
get a resolved image but but try to
detect the light because now of course

2060
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:45,280
detect the light because now of course
 

2061
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,349
detect the light because now of course
these exoplanets are detected by their

2062
00:36:47,349 --> 00:36:47,359
these exoplanets are detected by their
 

2063
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:49,829
these exoplanets are detected by their
effects on the parent star they either

2064
00:36:49,829 --> 00:36:49,839
effects on the parent star they either
 

2065
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:51,589
effects on the parent star they either
cause their parents start to dim

2066
00:36:51,589 --> 00:36:51,599
cause their parents start to dim
 

2067
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:53,670
cause their parents start to dim
slightly when they transit across in

2068
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:53,680
slightly when they transit across in
 

2069
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,710
slightly when they transit across in
front of it and so we see the dips or

2070
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:56,720
front of it and so we see the dips or
 

2071
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,870
front of it and so we see the dips or
their gravitational pull makes the star

2072
00:36:58,870 --> 00:36:58,880
their gravitational pull makes the star
 

2073
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,150
their gravitational pull makes the star
wobble a bit

2074
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:00,160
wobble a bit
 

2075
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,950
wobble a bit
so most of the the 5 000 plus planets

2076
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:02,960
so most of the the 5 000 plus planets
 

2077
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,270
so most of the the 5 000 plus planets
that have been found around other stars

2078
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:05,280
that have been found around other stars

they've been found indirectly by their
 

2081
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,109
they've been found indirectly by their
effects yes in one of those two ways on

2082
00:37:09,109 --> 00:37:09,119
effects yes in one of those two ways on
 

2083
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:10,310
effects yes in one of those two ways on
the page you can still do a pretty good

2084
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:10,320
the page you can still do a pretty good
 

2085
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,550
the page you can still do a pretty good
job of estimating size

2086
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:12,560
job of estimating size
 

2087
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,630
job of estimating size
all those kinds of subjects the size and

2088
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:14,640
all those kinds of subjects the size and
 

2089
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,589
all those kinds of subjects the size and
the mass you can estimate um but uh um

2090
00:37:17,589 --> 00:37:17,599
the mass you can estimate um but uh um
 

2091
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:18,870
the mass you can estimate um but uh um
but

2092
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:18,880
but
 

2093
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,670
but
detecting the the actual light from

one of these exoplanets hasn't really
 

2097
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,150
one of these exoplanets hasn't really
built on yet exactly one or two very

built on yet exactly one or two very
 

2099
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,150
built on yet exactly one or two very
very very bright big planets so maybe

2100
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:28,160
very very bright big planets so maybe
 

2101
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,150
very very bright big planets so maybe
like james webb telescope well james

and see if it's got oxygen or
 

2133
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,790
and see if it's got oxygen or

00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,550
that will come um james webb may may
make some some steps there um but

2138
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:12,560
make some some steps there um but
 

2139
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,790
make some some steps there um but
i think we can look forward to learning

2140
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:14,800
i think we can look forward to learning
 

2141
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,870
i think we can look forward to learning
quite a bit um in the next 20 years

2142
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:16,880
quite a bit um in the next 20 years
 

2143
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,069
quite a bit um in the next 20 years
because i like to say um supposing the

00:38:20,069 --> 00:38:20,079
because i like to say um supposing the

aliens looking at the solar system
 

2147
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,310
aliens looking at the solar system
then they see the sun as an ordinary

2148
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:24,320
then they see the sun as an ordinary
 

2149
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,750
then they see the sun as an ordinary
star they'd see

much fainter but if they could
 

2161
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,950

00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:40,560
they could learn quite a bit
 

2165
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,750

they could

2166
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:41,760
they could
 

2167
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,990
they could
perhaps get the spectre of the light and

2168
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:44,000
perhaps get the spectre of the light and
 

2169
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,510
perhaps get the spectre of the light and
find the atmosphere

2170
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:45,520
find the atmosphere
 

2171
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,790

they'd find the shade of blue was

00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:46,800
they'd find the shade of blue was
 

2173
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,950
they'd find the shade of blue was
slightly different depending on whether

slightly different depending on whether

slightly different depending on whether
the pacific ocean or lamas of asia was

the pacific ocean or lamas of asia was
 

2177
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,589
the pacific ocean or lamas of asia was
facing them so they could infer the

00:38:53,589 --> 00:38:53,599
facing them so they could infer the
 

2179
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:55,670
facing them so they could infer the
length of the day and the oceans and

length of the day and the oceans and
 

2181
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,670
length of the day and the oceans and

continents and maybe something about the
 

2183
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:01,030
continents and maybe something about the

seasons and the climate and uh that's
 

2185
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,310
seasons and the climate and uh that's
the kind of

the kind of
 

2187
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,510
the kind of

00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:11,920
and um
 

2197
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,390
and um
and evidence of some sort of

00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:14,400
and evidence of some sort of
 

2199
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,550
and evidence of some sort of

00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:16,560
biosphere on one of them would of course
 

2201
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,510
biosphere on one of them would of course
be crucial and it would rule out the uh

00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:19,520
be crucial and it would rule out the uh
 

2203
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,430
be crucial and it would rule out the uh
still logical possibilities that life is

still logical possibilities that life is
 

2205
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,109
still logical possibilities that life is
unique but there's another way in which

unique but there's another way in which

people think there could be something

00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,190

being sent
 

2217
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,950
being sent
to maybe not quite go under the ice but

00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:34,960
to maybe not quite go under the ice but
 

2219
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,030
to maybe not quite go under the ice but
detect the spray coming coming out to

00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:37,040
detect the spray coming coming out to
 

2221
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,349
detect the spray coming coming out to
see if there's evidence for organics in

00:39:39,349 --> 00:39:39,359
see if there's evidence for organics in
 

2223
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:41,190
see if there's evidence for organics in
that and

2224
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:41,200
that and
 

2225
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,910
that and
if we found any evidence for

2226
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:43,920
if we found any evidence for
 

2227
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,550
if we found any evidence for
an origin of life that happened

2228
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:46,560
an origin of life that happened
 

2229
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,630
an origin of life that happened
in either of those places that would

2230
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:48,640
in either of those places that would
 

2231
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,589
in either of those places that would
immediately be important because if

2232
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:51,599
immediately be important because if
 

2233
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:53,829
immediately be important because if
life has originated twice

2234
00:39:53,829 --> 00:39:53,839
life has originated twice
 

2235
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:56,230
life has originated twice
independently in one planetary system

2236
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:56,240
independently in one planetary system
 

2237
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,150
independently in one planetary system
the solar system that would tell us

2238
00:39:58,150 --> 00:39:58,160
the solar system that would tell us
 

2239
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,150
the solar system that would tell us
straight away it wasn't a rare accident

2240
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:00,160
straight away it wasn't a rare accident
 

2241
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,390
straight away it wasn't a rare accident
and must have happened billions of times

2242
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:02,400
and must have happened billions of times
 

2243
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,910
and must have happened billions of times
in the galaxy

2244
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:03,920
in the galaxy
 

2245
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,109
in the galaxy
at the moment

2246
00:40:05,109 --> 00:40:05,119
at the moment
 

2247
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:07,109
at the moment
we can't rule out it being unique and

2248
00:40:07,109 --> 00:40:07,119
we can't rule out it being unique and
 

2249
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:09,430
we can't rule out it being unique and
incidentally if we found life on mars

2250
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:09,440
incidentally if we found life on mars
 

2251
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,589
incidentally if we found life on mars
then that would still be ambiguous

2252
00:40:11,589 --> 00:40:11,599
then that would still be ambiguous
 

2253
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:14,069
then that would still be ambiguous
because uh um people have realized that

2254
00:40:14,069 --> 00:40:14,079
because uh um people have realized that
 

2255
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:16,470
because uh um people have realized that
this early life could have got from mars

2256
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:16,480
this early life could have got from mars
 

2257
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,349
this early life could have got from mars
to earth or vice versa on meteorites so

2258
00:40:19,349 --> 00:40:19,359
to earth or vice versa on meteorites so
 

2259
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:21,829
to earth or vice versa on meteorites so
um if you found life on mars then some

2260
00:40:21,829 --> 00:40:21,839
um if you found life on mars then some
 

2261
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:24,150
um if you found life on mars then some
skeptics could still say if it's a

2262
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:24,160
skeptics could still say if it's a
 

2263
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,510
skeptics could still say if it's a
single origin

2264
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:25,520
single origin
 

2265
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,670
single origin
but i think europa is far enough that's

2266
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:27,680
but i think europa is far enough that's
 

2267
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,950
but i think europa is far enough that's
far enough away

2268
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:28,960
far enough away
 

2269
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,190
far enough away
because yes so so that's why that would

2270
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:31,200
because yes so so that's why that would
 

2271
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,069
because yes so so that's why that would
be especially it's always the skeptics

2272
00:40:34,069 --> 00:40:34,079
be especially it's always the skeptics
 

2273
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:37,190
be especially it's always the skeptics
that ruin a good party but

2274
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:37,200
that ruin a good party but
 

2275
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,790
that ruin a good party but
but we need them of course we need them

2276
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:38,800
but we need them of course we need them
 

2277
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,550
but we need them of course we need them
at the party we need some skeptics at

2278
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:40,560
at the party we need some skeptics at
 

2279
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,349
at the party we need some skeptics at
the party yeah um but boy would that be

2280
00:40:43,349 --> 00:40:43,359
the party yeah um but boy would that be
 

2281
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:46,230
the party yeah um but boy would that be
so exciting to find life mm-hmm on one

2282
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:46,240
so exciting to find life mm-hmm on one
 

2283
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,630
so exciting to find life mm-hmm on one
of the moons yes

2284
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:48,640
of the moons yes
 

2285
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,670
of the moons yes
because

2286
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:49,680
because
 

2287
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,790
because
that's

2288
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:50,800
that's
 

2289
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,790
that's
that'll just be any kind of vegetation

2290
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:52,800
that'll just be any kind of vegetation
 

2291

that'll just be any kind of vegetation
or life um the question of the um aliens

or life um the question of the um aliens
of science fiction is a different matter

00:40:58,630 --> 00:40:58,640
of science fiction is a different matter
 

2295
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,230

intelligent aliens

2296
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:00,240
intelligent aliens
 

2297

yeah but if you

2298
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:01,760
yeah but if you
 

2299
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,630
yeah but if you
have a good indication that there's life

2300
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:04,640
have a good indication that there's life
 

2301
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,870
have a good indication that there's life
elsewhere in the solar system

2302
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:06,880
elsewhere in the solar system
 

2303
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,470
elsewhere in the solar system
that means life is everywhere

2304
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:10,480
that means life is everywhere
 

2305
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,710
that means life is everywhere
yep and that yep

2306
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:12,720
yep and that yep
 

2307
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,390
yep and that yep
i don't know if that's terrifying or

2308
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:14,400
i don't know if that's terrifying or
 

2309
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,910
i don't know if that's terrifying or
what that is because if life is

2310
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:15,920
what that is because if life is
 

2311
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,190
what that is because if life is
everywhere

2312
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:17,200
everywhere
 

2313
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,309
everywhere
why is intelligent life not everywhere

2314
00:41:20,309 --> 00:41:20,319
why is intelligent life not everywhere
 

2315
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:22,309
why is intelligent life not everywhere
why i mean you've talked about that most

2316
00:41:22,309 --> 00:41:22,319
why i mean you've talked about that most
 

2317
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:23,430
why i mean you've talked about that most
likely

2318
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:23,440
likely
 

2319
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,910
likely
alien civilizations if they are out

alien civilizations if they are out
there

2322
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:26,960
there
 

2323
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,750
there
they would likely be far ahead of us

2324
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:29,760
they would likely be far ahead of us
 

2325
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,230
they would likely be far ahead of us
the ones that would actually communicate

2326
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:32,240
the ones that would actually communicate
 

2327
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:36,069
the ones that would actually communicate
with us yes and that

2328
00:41:36,069 --> 00:41:36,079
with us yes and that

um
again one of those things is both

00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:38,880
again one of those things is both
 

2333
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,710
again one of those things is both
exciting and terrifying you you've

2334
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:40,720
exciting and terrifying you you've
 

2335

well i think

00:41:45,589 --> 00:41:45,599
well i think
 

2341
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:47,589
well i think
that's important of course again it's a

on telescopes to do this and so i think

2362
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:10,960
on telescopes to do this and so i think
 

2363
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,430
on telescopes to do this and so i think
it's worthwhile even though i i don't

2364
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:13,440
it's worthwhile even though i i don't

00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:19,760
leave me to wonder what
 

2371
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,230
leave me to wonder what
might be detected and um

2372
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:22,240
might be detected and um
 

2373
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,430
might be detected and um
i think

2374
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:23,440
i think
 

2375
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,550
i think
well we don't know we've got to be

2376
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:24,560
well we don't know we've got to be
 

2377
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,990
well we don't know we've got to be

what it will be and so any anomalous

2380
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:28,160
what it will be and so any anomalous
 

2381
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,470
what it will be and so any anomalous
objects or even some strange shiny

2382

we've got to keep our eyes open for but

2386
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:35,280
we've got to keep our eyes open for but
 

2387
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,510
we've got to keep our eyes open for but
i think um if we

2388
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:37,520
i think um if we
 

2389
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,550
i think um if we
ask

2390
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:38,560
ask
 

2391
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:39,430
ask
what

2392
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:39,440
what
 

2393
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,190
what
about a um

2394
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:41,200
about a um
 

2395
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,670
about a um
planet like the earth where evolution

2396
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:43,680

had taken more of the same track

2398
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:45,680
had taken more of the same track
 

2399
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,710
had taken more of the same track
then as you say it wouldn't be

2400
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:46,720
then as you say it wouldn't be
 

2401
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,829
then as you say it wouldn't be
synchronized um if it uh had

2402
00:42:49,829 --> 00:42:49,839
synchronized um if it uh had
 

2403
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:51,670
synchronized um if it uh had
lagged behind then of course it would

2404
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:51,680
lagged behind then of course it would
 

2405
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,430
lagged behind then of course it would
not have got too

2406
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:53,440
not have got too
 

2407
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,950
not have got too
advanced life

2408
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:54,960
advanced life
 

2409
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,550
advanced life
but it may

2410
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:56,560
but it may
 

2411
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,309
but it may
have had a head start it may have formed

2412
00:42:58,309 --> 00:42:58,319
have had a head start it may have formed
 

2413
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:01,430
have had a head start it may have formed
on a plant around an older star okay but

2414
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:01,440
on a plant around an older star okay but
 

2415
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,470
on a plant around an older star okay but
then let's ask what would see um

2416
00:43:04,470 --> 00:43:04,480
then let's ask what would see um
 

2417
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,230
then let's ask what would see um
it's taken nearly four billion years

2418
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:06,240
it's taken nearly four billion years
 

2419
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,309
it's taken nearly four billion years
from the first life to us

2420
00:43:08,309 --> 00:43:08,319
from the first life to us
 

2421
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:09,990
from the first life to us
and we've now got this technological

2422
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:10,000
and we've now got this technological
 

2423
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,589
and we've now got this technological
civilization

2424
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:11,599
civilization
 

2425
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:12,950
civilization
which

2426
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:12,960
which
 

2427
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,550
which
could make itself

2428
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:14,560
could make itself
 

2429
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,910
could make itself
detectable um to any alien live

2430
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:17,920
detectable um to any alien live
 

2431
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,150
detectable um to any alien live
aliens out there

2432
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:20,160
aliens out there
 

2433
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,470
aliens out there
but i think most people would say

2434
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:22,480
but i think most people would say
 

2435
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,990
but i think most people would say
that this

2436
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:24,000
that this
 

2437
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,349
that this
civilization

2438
00:43:25,349 --> 00:43:25,359
civilization
 

2439
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:27,270
civilization
of flesh and blood creatures in the

2440
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:27,280
of flesh and blood creatures in the
 

2441
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,589
of flesh and blood creatures in the
collective civilization may not last

2442
00:43:29,589 --> 00:43:29,599
collective civilization may not last
 

2443
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:31,589
collective civilization may not last
more than a few hundred years more

2444
00:43:31,589 --> 00:43:31,599
more than a few hundred years more
 

2445
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:33,190
more than a few hundred years more
i think that the

2446
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:33,200
i think that the
 

2447
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,750
i think that the
bad people may some people say

2448
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:35,760
bad people may some people say
 

2449
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:39,349
bad people may some people say
it will um kill itself off um but i'm

2450
00:43:39,349 --> 00:43:39,359
it will um kill itself off um but i'm
 

2451
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:41,510
it will um kill itself off um but i'm
more optimistic and i would say

2452
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:41,520
more optimistic and i would say
 

2453
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,790
more optimistic and i would say
that sir

2454
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:42,800
that sir
 

2455
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,109
that sir
what we're going to have in future

2456
00:43:45,109 --> 00:43:45,119
what we're going to have in future
 

2457
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:46,630
what we're going to have in future
is um

2458
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:46,640
is um
 

2459
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,510
is um
no longer the slow darwinian selection

2460
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:49,520
no longer the slow darwinian selection
 

2461
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,349
no longer the slow darwinian selection
but we're going to have what i call

2462
00:43:51,349 --> 00:43:51,359
but we're going to have what i call
 

2463
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:53,750
but we're going to have what i call
secular intelligent design which would

2464
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:53,760
secular intelligent design which would
 

2465
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:54,630
secular intelligent design which would
be

2466
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:54,640
be
 

2467
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:55,910
be
humans

2468
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:55,920
humans
 

2469
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,710
humans
designing um

2470
00:43:58,710 --> 00:43:58,720
designing um
 

2471
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:01,109
designing um
their progeny to be better adapted to

2472
00:44:01,109 --> 00:44:01,119
their progeny to be better adapted to
 

2473
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:02,630
their progeny to be better adapted to
where they are

2474
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:02,640
where they are
 

2475
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,150
where they are
and

2476
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:04,160
and
 

2477
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,829
and
if they go to mars or something

2478
00:44:05,829 --> 00:44:05,839
if they go to mars or something
 

2479
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:07,910
if they go to mars or something
somewhere they're badly adapted they

2480
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:07,920
somewhere they're badly adapted they
 

2481
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:10,230
somewhere they're badly adapted they
want to adapt a lot and so

2482
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:10,240
want to adapt a lot and so
 

2483
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,309
want to adapt a lot and so
they will adapt

2484
00:44:12,309 --> 00:44:12,319
they will adapt
 

2485
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:14,069
they will adapt
but there may be some limits to what

2486
00:44:14,069 --> 00:44:14,079
but there may be some limits to what
 

2487
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:15,910
but there may be some limits to what
could be done with flesh and blood and

2488
00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:15,920
could be done with flesh and blood and
 

2489
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,990
could be done with flesh and blood and
so they may become

2490
00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:18,000
so they may become
 

2491
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,829
so they may become
largely electronic

2492
00:44:19,829 --> 00:44:19,839
largely electronic
 

2493
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:20,790
largely electronic
um

2494
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:20,800
um
 

2495
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,630
um
download their brains and have and be

2496
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:22,640
download their brains and have and be
 

2497
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,390
download their brains and have and be
exonic entities and if they're

2498
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:24,400
exonic entities and if they're
 

2499
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,550
exonic entities and if they're
electronic

2500
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:26,560
electronic
 

2501
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,309
electronic
then what's important is that they're

2502
00:44:28,309 --> 00:44:28,319
then what's important is that they're
 

2503
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:30,630
then what's important is that they're
near immortal

2504
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:30,640
near immortal
 

2505
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,510
near immortal
and also they won't unless they want to

2506
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:33,520
and also they won't unless they want to
 

2507
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,109
and also they won't unless they want to
be on a planet with an atmosphere or

2508
00:44:35,109 --> 00:44:35,119
be on a planet with an atmosphere or
 

2509
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:37,109
be on a planet with an atmosphere or
gravity they may go off into the blue

2510
00:44:37,109 --> 00:44:37,119
gravity they may go off into the blue
 

2511
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:39,109
gravity they may go off into the blue
yonder and they and if they're near

2512
00:44:39,109 --> 00:44:39,119
yonder and they and if they're near
 

2513
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:40,550
yonder and they and if they're near
immortal they won't be daunted by

2514
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:40,560
immortal they won't be daunted by
 

2515
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,950
immortal they won't be daunted by
interstellar travel taking a long time

2516
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:42,960
interstellar travel taking a long time
 

2517
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,109
interstellar travel taking a long time
and so um

2518
00:44:45,109 --> 00:44:45,119
and so um
 

2519
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:45,990
and so um
if

2520
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:46,000
if
 

2521
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,349
if
if we

2522
00:44:47,349 --> 00:44:47,359
if we
 

2523
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:50,630
if we
looked at what would happen on the earth

2524
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:50,640
looked at what would happen on the earth
 

2525
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,190
looked at what would happen on the earth
in the next millions of years

2526
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:53,200
in the next millions of years
 

2527
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,750
in the next millions of years
then there may be these electronic

2528
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:55,760
then there may be these electronic
 

2529
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:58,470
then there may be these electronic
entities which have been sent out and

2530
00:44:58,470 --> 00:44:58,480
entities which have been sent out and
 

2531
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,790
entities which have been sent out and
are now far away from the earth

2532
00:45:00,790 --> 00:45:00,800
are now far away from the earth
 

2533
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,790
are now far away from the earth
but still sort of burping away in some

2534
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:02,800
but still sort of burping away in some
 

2535
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,910
but still sort of burping away in some
in some fashion to be detected um and so

2536
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:05,920
in some fashion to be detected um and so
 

2537
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,309
in some fashion to be detected um and so
uh this um this therefore leads me to

2538
00:45:08,309 --> 00:45:08,319
uh this um this therefore leads me to
 

2539
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:09,990
uh this um this therefore leads me to
think that um

2540
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:10,000
think that um
 

2541
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,270
think that um
if there

2542
00:45:11,270 --> 00:45:11,280
if there
 

2543
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,550
if there
was another

2544
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:12,560
was another
 

2545
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,470
was another
planet which had evolved like the earth

2546
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:14,480
planet which had evolved like the earth
 

2547
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,150
planet which had evolved like the earth
and was ahead of us

2548
00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:16,160
and was ahead of us
 

2549
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,870
and was ahead of us
uh it wouldn't be synchronized so he

2550
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:18,880
uh it wouldn't be synchronized so he
 

2551
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:19,910
uh it wouldn't be synchronized so he
wouldn't see a flesh and blood

2552
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:19,920
wouldn't see a flesh and blood
 

2553
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,069
wouldn't see a flesh and blood
civilization but we would see

2554
00:45:22,069 --> 00:45:22,079
civilization but we would see
 

2555
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:25,430
civilization but we would see
these electronic progeny as it were um

2556
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:25,440
these electronic progeny as it were um
 

2557
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,349
these electronic progeny as it were um
and then this raises another question

2558
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:27,359
and then this raises another question
 

2559
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:29,190
and then this raises another question
because um

2560
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:29,200
because um
 

2561
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,430
because um
there's the famous argument against

2562
00:45:31,430 --> 00:45:31,440
there's the famous argument against
 

2563
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,230
there's the famous argument against
there being um uh lots of aliens out

2564
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:34,240
there being um uh lots of aliens out
 

2565
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,550
there being um uh lots of aliens out
there which is that they would um come

2566
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:36,560
there which is that they would um come
 

2567
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,309
there which is that they would um come
and invade us and eat us or something

2568
00:45:38,309 --> 00:45:38,319
and invade us and eat us or something
 

2569
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:39,589
and invade us and eat us or something
like that you know

2570
00:45:39,589 --> 00:45:39,599
like that you know
 

2571
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:42,950
like that you know
that's a common idea uh which so fairly

2572
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:42,960
that's a common idea uh which so fairly
 

2573
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,030
that's a common idea uh which so fairly
is attributed to i've been the first to

2574
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:45,040
is attributed to i've been the first to
 

2575
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:48,470
is attributed to i've been the first to
say um and i think there's a um escape

2576
00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:48,480
say um and i think there's a um escape
 

2577
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:52,309
say um and i think there's a um escape
clause to that because these um entities

2578
00:45:52,309 --> 00:45:52,319
clause to that because these um entities
 

2579
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:53,829
clause to that because these um entities
yeah would be

2580
00:45:53,829 --> 00:45:53,839
yeah would be
 

2581
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:55,990
yeah would be
say that they evolved by secular

2582
00:45:55,990 --> 00:45:56,000
say that they evolved by secular
 

2583
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,910
say that they evolved by secular
intellectual design designed by their

2584
00:45:57,910 --> 00:45:57,920
intellectual design designed by their
 

2585
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,790
intellectual design designed by their
predecessors and then designed by us

2586
00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:00,800
predecessors and then designed by us
 

2587
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,950
predecessors and then designed by us
and

2588
00:46:02,950 --> 00:46:02,960
and
 

2589
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,190
and
whereas darwinian selection requires two

2590
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:05,200
whereas darwinian selection requires two
 

2591
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,470
whereas darwinian selection requires two
things

2592
00:46:06,470 --> 00:46:06,480
things
 

2593
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,390
things
it requires aggression

2594
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:08,400
it requires aggression
 

2595
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,470
it requires aggression
and intelligence

2596
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:10,480
and intelligence
 

2597
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:14,630
and intelligence
this future intel design um uh may favor

2598
00:46:14,630 --> 00:46:14,640
this future intel design um uh may favor
 

2599
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:15,910
this future intel design um uh may favor
intelligence because that's what they

2600
00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:15,920
intelligence because that's what they
 

2601
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,990
intelligence because that's what they
were designed for but it may not favor

2602
00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:18,000
were designed for but it may not favor
 

2603
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,349
were designed for but it may not favor
aggression

2604
00:46:19,349 --> 00:46:19,359
aggression
 

2605
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:21,589
aggression
and so these future entities they they

2606
00:46:21,589 --> 00:46:21,599
and so these future entities they they
 

2607
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:22,790
and so these future entities they they
may be um

2608
00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:22,800
may be um
 

2609
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,390
may be um

um
 

2615
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,390
um
and uh not

2616
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:28,400
and uh not
 

2617
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,309
and uh not
being at all expansionists so they could

2618
00:46:30,309 --> 00:46:30,319
being at all expansionists so they could
 

2619
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:31,510
being at all expansionists so they could
be out there

2620
00:46:31,510 --> 00:46:31,520
be out there
 

2621
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,990
be out there
yeah um and we can't refute their

2622
00:46:33,990 --> 00:46:34,000
yeah um and we can't refute their
 

2623
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,550
yeah um and we can't refute their
existence in the way the fermi paradox

2624
00:46:36,550 --> 00:46:36,560
existence in the way the fermi paradox
 

2625
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,630
existence in the way the fermi paradox
is supposed to refute their existence

2626
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:38,640
is supposed to refute their existence
 

2627
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,710
is supposed to refute their existence
because um these would not be aggressive

2628
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:40,720
because um these would not be aggressive
 

2629
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:43,349
because um these would not be aggressive
or expansionist well maybe evolution

2630
00:46:43,349 --> 00:46:43,359
or expansionist well maybe evolution
 

2631
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:45,829
or expansionist well maybe evolution
requires competition not aggression and

2632
00:46:45,829 --> 00:46:45,839
requires competition not aggression and
 

2633
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:48,069
requires competition not aggression and
i wonder if competition can take forms

2634
00:46:48,069 --> 00:46:48,079
i wonder if competition can take forms
 

2635
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:49,990
i wonder if competition can take forms
that are non-expansionary

2636
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:50,000
that are non-expansionary
 

2637
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,550
that are non-expansionary
so you can still have fun competing yeah

2638
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:52,560
so you can still have fun competing yeah
 

2639
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,470
so you can still have fun competing yeah
in the space of ideas

2640
00:46:54,470 --> 00:46:54,480
in the space of ideas
 

2641
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:57,270
in the space of ideas
which maybe primarily adobe philosophers

2642
00:46:57,270 --> 00:46:57,280
which maybe primarily adobe philosophers
 

2643
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:57,940
which maybe primarily adobe philosophers
perhaps yeah

2644
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:57,950
perhaps yeah
 

2645
00:46:57,950 --> 00:46:59,510
perhaps yeah
[Laughter]

2646
00:46:59,510 --> 00:46:59,520
[Laughter]
 

2647
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,990
[Laughter]
in in a way right it's a

2648
00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:02,000
in in a way right it's a
 

2649
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,630
in in a way right it's a
it's an intellectual exercise versus a

2650
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:04,640
it's an intellectual exercise versus a
 

2651
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:05,750
it's an intellectual exercise versus a
sort of

2652
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:05,760
sort of
 

2653
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,829
sort of
violent exercise

2654
00:47:07,829 --> 00:47:07,839
violent exercise
 

2655
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:08,870
violent exercise
so

2656
00:47:08,870 --> 00:47:08,880
so
 

2657
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,670
so
what does this civilization on mars look

2658
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:11,680
what does this civilization on mars look
 

2659
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,589
what does this civilization on mars look
like so do you think

2660
00:47:13,589 --> 00:47:13,599
like so do you think
 

2661
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:15,670
like so do you think
we would more and more you know maybe

2662
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:15,680
we would more and more you know maybe
 

2663
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,829
we would more and more you know maybe
start with some genetic modification and

robots 50 years ago couldn't do anything

2702
00:48:03,990 --> 00:48:04,000
robots 50 years ago couldn't do anything
 

2703
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,990
robots 50 years ago couldn't do anything
very much but now they could assemble

2704
00:48:05,990 --> 00:48:06,000
very much but now they could assemble
 

2705
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,230
very much but now they could assemble
big structures on space or

2706
00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:08,240
big structures on space or
 

2707
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:10,790
big structures on space or
um in space or on the moon and they

2708
00:48:10,790 --> 00:48:10,800
um in space or on the moon and they
 

2709
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,589
um in space or on the moon and they
could probably do exploration

2710
00:48:13,589 --> 00:48:13,599
could probably do exploration
 

2711
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,510
could probably do exploration
well present ones

well present ones
 

2713
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:19,270
well present ones
uh on mars um can't actually um

2714
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:19,280
uh on mars um can't actually um
 

2715
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,589
uh on mars um can't actually um
do the geology but future ai will be

2716
00:48:21,589 --> 00:48:21,599
do the geology but future ai will be
 

2717
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:23,990
do the geology but future ai will be
able to do the geology and already they

2718
00:48:23,990 --> 00:48:24,000
able to do the geology and already they
 

2719
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,430
able to do the geology and already they
can dig on mars and so if you want to do

2720
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:27,440
can dig on mars and so if you want to do
 

2721
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,790
can dig on mars and so if you want to do
exploration of mars and of course

2722
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:30,800
exploration of mars and of course
 

2723
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,630
exploration of mars and of course
even more of them

2724
00:48:32,630 --> 00:48:32,640
even more of them
 

2725
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:33,510

of those are necessary for robots so the

00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:36,640
killed the seven people in the crew
 

2785
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:37,510
killed the seven people in the crew
and

2786
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:37,520
and
 

2787
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:40,790
and
it had been mistakenly presented as safe

2788
00:49:40,790 --> 00:49:40,800
it had been mistakenly presented as safe
 

2789
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,790
it had been mistakenly presented as safe
for civilians and there was a woman

2790
00:49:42,790 --> 00:49:42,800
for civilians and there was a woman
 

2791
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,390
for civilians and there was a woman
school teacher killed in one of them it

2792
00:49:44,390 --> 00:49:44,400
school teacher killed in one of them it
 

2793
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,549
school teacher killed in one of them it
was a big national trauma and they tried

2794
00:49:46,549 --> 00:49:46,559
was a big national trauma and they tried
 

2795
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:50,309
was a big national trauma and they tried
to make it safer still um but

2796
00:49:50,309 --> 00:49:50,319
to make it safer still um but
 

2797
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:52,710
to make it safer still um but
if you launch into space

2798
00:49:52,710 --> 00:49:52,720
if you launch into space
 

2799
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,309
if you launch into space
just the kind of people prepared to

2800
00:49:54,309 --> 00:49:54,319
just the kind of people prepared to
 

2801
00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:56,069
just the kind of people prepared to
accept that sort of risk and of course

2802
00:49:56,069 --> 00:49:56,079
accept that sort of risk and of course
 

2803
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:58,150
accept that sort of risk and of course
test pilots and people who go hang

2804
00:49:58,150 --> 00:49:58,160
test pilots and people who go hang
 

2805
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,670
test pilots and people who go hang
gliding and

2806
00:49:59,670 --> 00:49:59,680
gliding and
 

2807
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,910
gliding and
go to the south pole etc are prepared to

2808
00:50:01,910 --> 00:50:01,920
go to the south pole etc are prepared to
 

2809
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,950
go to the south pole etc are prepared to
accept uh a two percent risk at least

2810
00:50:04,950 --> 00:50:04,960
accept uh a two percent risk at least
 

2811
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,950
accept uh a two percent risk at least
for a big challenge then of course you

2812
00:50:06,950 --> 00:50:06,960
for a big challenge then of course you
 

2813
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,870
for a big challenge then of course you
do it more cheaply and that's why um uh

2814
00:50:10,870 --> 00:50:10,880
do it more cheaply and that's why um uh
 

2815
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:13,349
do it more cheaply and that's why um uh
i think um human space flies should be

2816
00:50:13,349 --> 00:50:13,359
i think um human space flies should be
 

2817
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:15,270
i think um human space flies should be
left to the billionaires

2818
00:50:15,270 --> 00:50:15,280
left to the billionaires
 

2819
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,230
left to the billionaires
um

2820
00:50:16,230 --> 00:50:16,240
um
 

2821
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:18,630
um
and their sponsors um because then the

2822
00:50:18,630 --> 00:50:18,640
and their sponsors um because then the
 

2823
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,349
and their sponsors um because then the
taxpayers aren't paying and they can

2824
00:50:21,349 --> 00:50:21,359
taxpayers aren't paying and they can
 

2825
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:22,390
taxpayers aren't paying and they can
launch

2826
00:50:22,390 --> 00:50:22,400
launch
 

2827
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,950
launch
simply those people who are prepared

2828
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:24,960
simply those people who are prepared
 

2829
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,390
simply those people who are prepared
to accept

2830
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:26,400
to accept
 

2831
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:27,750
to accept
high risks

2832
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:27,760
high risks
 

2833
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:30,309
high risks
space adventure not space tourism yeah

2834
00:50:30,309 --> 00:50:30,319
space adventure not space tourism yeah
 

2835
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:33,109
space adventure not space tourism yeah
and and we should cheer them on um and

2836
00:50:33,109 --> 00:50:33,119
and and we should cheer them on um and
 

2837
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:34,230
and and we should cheer them on um and
um

2838
00:50:34,230 --> 00:50:34,240
um
 

2839
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:37,030
um
as regards where they would go

2840
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:37,040
as regards where they would go
 

2841
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:38,390
as regards where they would go
then um

2842
00:50:38,390 --> 00:50:38,400
then um
 

2843
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,390
then um
low earth orbit i suspect can be done

2844
00:50:40,390 --> 00:50:40,400
low earth orbit i suspect can be done
 

2845
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,950
low earth orbit i suspect can be done
quite cheaply in future but going to

2846
00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:42,960
quite cheaply in future but going to
 

2847
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,230
quite cheaply in future but going to
mars

2848
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:44,240
mars
 

2849
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,990
mars
which is very very expensive and

2850
00:50:45,990 --> 00:50:46,000
which is very very expensive and
 

2851
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,790
which is very very expensive and
dangerous for humans um the only people

2852
00:50:48,790 --> 00:50:48,800
dangerous for humans um the only people
 

2853
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:51,190
dangerous for humans um the only people
who would go would be um these um

2854
00:50:51,190 --> 00:50:51,200
who would go would be um these um
 

2855
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:54,470
who would go would be um these um
adventurers um maybe

2856
00:50:54,470 --> 00:50:54,480
adventurers um maybe
 

2857
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,150
adventurers um maybe
on a one-way trip like some of the early

2858
00:50:56,150 --> 00:50:56,160
on a one-way trip like some of the early
 

2859
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:58,230
on a one-way trip like some of the early
polar explorers and magellan and people

2860
00:50:58,230 --> 00:50:58,240
polar explorers and magellan and people
 

2861
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,390
polar explorers and magellan and people
like that you know and we would cheer

2862
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:00,400
like that you know and we would cheer
 

2863
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,790
like that you know and we would cheer
them on um and

2864
00:51:02,790 --> 00:51:02,800
them on um and
 

2865
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:03,750
them on um and
i

2866
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:03,760
i
 

2867
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,589
i
expect and i've ever hoped that by the

2868
00:51:05,589 --> 00:51:05,599
expect and i've ever hoped that by the
 

2869
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:07,190
expect and i've ever hoped that by the
end of a century

2870
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:07,200
end of a century
 

2871
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,430
end of a century
there will be a small community

2872
00:51:09,430 --> 00:51:09,440
there will be a small community
 

2873
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:12,630
there will be a small community
of such people on mars

2874
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:12,640
of such people on mars
 

2875
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:15,030
of such people on mars
um living they uncomfortably far less

2876
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:15,040
um living they uncomfortably far less
 

2877
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,950
um living they uncomfortably far less
comfortably than at the south pole or

2878
00:51:16,950 --> 00:51:16,960
comfortably than at the south pole or
 

2879
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,309
comfortably than at the south pole or
the bottom of the ocean or the top of

2880
00:51:18,309 --> 00:51:18,319
the bottom of the ocean or the top of
 

2881
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:21,510
the bottom of the ocean or the top of
everest but they will be there

2882
00:51:21,510 --> 00:51:21,520
everest but they will be there
 

2883
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,430
everest but they will be there
and they won't have a

2884
00:51:23,430 --> 00:51:23,440
and they won't have a
 

2885
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:26,150
and they won't have a
certain ticket um but they'll be there

2886
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:26,160
certain ticket um but they'll be there
 

2887
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,270
certain ticket um but they'll be there
um

2888
00:51:27,270 --> 00:51:27,280
um
 

2889
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,950
um
incidentally i think it's a dangerous

2890
00:51:28,950 --> 00:51:28,960
incidentally i think it's a dangerous
 

2891
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:32,390
incidentally i think it's a dangerous
delusion to think as uh elon musk

2892
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:32,400
delusion to think as uh elon musk
 

2893
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,470
delusion to think as uh elon musk
has said that we can have mass

2894
00:51:34,470 --> 00:51:34,480
has said that we can have mass
 

2895
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,549
has said that we can have mass
emigration

2896
00:51:36,549 --> 00:51:36,559
emigration
 

2897
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:39,270
emigration
from the earth to mars to escape the

2898
00:51:39,270 --> 00:51:39,280
from the earth to mars to escape the
 

2899
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,349
from the earth to mars to escape the
earth's problems

2900
00:51:41,349 --> 00:51:41,359
earth's problems
 

2901
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:42,870
earth's problems
it's a dangerous illusion because it's

2902
00:51:42,870 --> 00:51:42,880
it's a dangerous illusion because it's
 

2903
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:43,750
it's a dangerous illusion because it's
far

2904
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:43,760
far
 

2905
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,910
far
easier to deal with climate change on

2906
00:51:45,910 --> 00:51:45,920
easier to deal with climate change on
 

2907
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:47,030
easier to deal with climate change on
earth

2908
00:51:47,030 --> 00:51:47,040
earth
 

2909
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:49,589
earth
than to terraform mars to make it

2910
00:51:49,589 --> 00:51:49,599
than to terraform mars to make it
 

2911
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:51,829
than to terraform mars to make it
properly habitable to humans and so

2912
00:51:51,829 --> 00:51:51,839
properly habitable to humans and so
 

2913
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:53,829
properly habitable to humans and so
there's no planet beef or risk-averse

2914
00:51:53,829 --> 00:51:53,839
there's no planet beef or risk-averse
 

2915
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:56,230
there's no planet beef or risk-averse
people but for these crazy adventurers

2916
00:51:56,230 --> 00:51:56,240
people but for these crazy adventurers
 

2917
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:58,069
people but for these crazy adventurers
then you can imagine that

2918
00:51:58,069 --> 00:51:58,079
then you can imagine that
 

2919
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:01,030
then you can imagine that
they would be trying to live on mars as

2920
00:52:01,030 --> 00:52:01,040
they would be trying to live on mars as
 

2921
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:04,150
they would be trying to live on mars as
um as great pioneers and by the end of

2922
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:04,160
um as great pioneers and by the end of
 

2923
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:05,270
um as great pioneers and by the end of
century

2924
00:52:05,270 --> 00:52:05,280
century
 

2925
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:06,950
century
then there will be huge advances

2926
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:06,960
then there will be huge advances
 

2927
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,430
then there will be huge advances
compared to the present in two things

2928
00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:09,440
compared to the present in two things
 

2929
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:12,710
compared to the present in two things
first in in understanding genetics

2930
00:52:12,710 --> 00:52:12,720
first in in understanding genetics
 

2931
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:14,790
first in in understanding genetics
so is to genetically redesign one's

2932
00:52:14,790 --> 00:52:14,800
so is to genetically redesign one's

00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:31,670
one hopes be heavily regulated on earth
on potentials

2948
00:52:31,670 --> 00:52:31,680
on potentials
 

2949
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:34,069
on potentials
and ethical grounds and of course we are

2950
00:52:34,069 --> 00:52:34,079
and ethical grounds and of course we are
 

2951
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:35,990
and ethical grounds and of course we are
pretty well adapted to the earth so we

2952
00:52:35,990 --> 00:52:36,000
pretty well adapted to the earth so we
 

2953
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,430
pretty well adapted to the earth so we
don't have the incentive to do these

2954
00:52:37,430 --> 00:52:37,440
don't have the incentive to do these
 

2955
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:40,470
don't have the incentive to do these
things in the way they were there so um

2956
00:52:40,470 --> 00:52:40,480
things in the way they were there so um
 

2957
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:43,990
things in the way they were there so um
our argument is that um it'll be

2958
00:52:43,990 --> 00:52:44,000
our argument is that um it'll be
 

2959
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,270
our argument is that um it'll be
those

2960
00:52:45,270 --> 00:52:45,280
those
 

2961
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:47,589
those
crazy pioneers on mars

2962
00:52:47,589 --> 00:52:47,599
crazy pioneers on mars
 

2963
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:49,109
crazy pioneers on mars
using all these

2964
00:52:49,109 --> 00:52:49,119
using all these
 

2965
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:50,950
using all these
scientific advances which will be

2966
00:52:50,950 --> 00:52:50,960
scientific advances which will be
 

2967
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,549
scientific advances which will be
controlled here

2968
00:52:52,549 --> 00:52:52,559
controlled here
 

2969
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:54,230
controlled here
away from the regulators

2970
00:52:54,230 --> 00:52:54,240
away from the regulators
 

2971
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:55,430
away from the regulators
they will

2972
00:52:55,430 --> 00:52:55,440
they will
 

2973
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:58,630
they will
transition into a new post-human species

2974
00:52:58,630 --> 00:52:58,640
transition into a new post-human species
 

2975
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:02,549
transition into a new post-human species
and so um if they do that and if they

2976
00:53:02,549 --> 00:53:02,559
and so um if they do that and if they
 

2977
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:04,069
and so um if they do that and if they
transition into something which is

2978
00:53:04,069 --> 00:53:04,079
transition into something which is
 

2979
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:05,349
transition into something which is
electronic

2980
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:05,359
electronic
 

2981
00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:07,109
electronic
eventually because there may be some

2982
00:53:07,109 --> 00:53:07,119
eventually because there may be some
 

2983
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:09,030
eventually because there may be some
limits to the capacity of flesh and

2984
00:53:09,030 --> 00:53:09,040
limits to the capacity of flesh and
 

2985
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:12,069
limits to the capacity of flesh and
blood brains anyways um then um those

2986
00:53:12,069 --> 00:53:12,079
blood brains anyways um then um those
 

2987
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:14,790
blood brains anyways um then um those
electronic entities um may not want to

2988
00:53:14,790 --> 00:53:14,800
electronic entities um may not want to
 

2989
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,309
electronic entities um may not want to
stay on the planet like mars they may

2990
00:53:16,309 --> 00:53:16,319
stay on the planet like mars they may
 

2991
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:18,950
stay on the planet like mars they may
want to go go away and so they'll be the

2992
00:53:18,950 --> 00:53:18,960
want to go go away and so they'll be the
 

2993
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:21,750
want to go go away and so they'll be the
precursors of the future

2994
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:21,760
precursors of the future
 

2995
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:24,710
precursors of the future
um evolution of life and intelligence

2996
00:53:24,710 --> 00:53:24,720
um evolution of life and intelligence
 

2997
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,150
um evolution of life and intelligence
coming from the earth

2998
00:53:26,150 --> 00:53:26,160
coming from the earth
 

2999
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,549
coming from the earth
and of course there's one point which

3000
00:53:28,549 --> 00:53:28,559
and of course there's one point which
 

3001
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:30,309
and of course there's one point which
perhaps astronomers are more aware of

00:53:30,309 --> 00:53:30,319
perhaps astronomers are more aware of
 

3003
00:53:30,319 --> 00:53:31,829
perhaps astronomers are more aware of

00:53:31,829 --> 00:53:31,839
than most people
 

3005
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:34,230
than most people
most people are aware that we are the

00:53:34,230 --> 00:53:34,240
most people are aware that we are the
 

3007
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:35,829
most people are aware that we are the
outcome of four billion years of

most of them nonetheless probably think

00:53:39,349 --> 00:53:39,359
most of them nonetheless probably think
 

3013
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:41,030
most of them nonetheless probably think
that we humans

3014
00:53:41,030 --> 00:53:41,040
that we humans
 

3015
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,430
that we humans
are somehow the culmination

3016
00:53:43,430 --> 00:53:43,440
are somehow the culmination

00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,670
are somehow the culmination
the top of the tree

00:53:45,670 --> 00:53:45,680
the top of the tree
 

3019
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:46,950
the top of the tree
but yes

3020
00:53:46,950 --> 00:53:46,960
but yes
 

3021
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,710
but yes
no astronomers can believe that because

3022
00:53:48,710 --> 00:53:48,720
no astronomers can believe that because
 

3023
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,309
no astronomers can believe that because
astronomers know

3024
00:53:50,309 --> 00:53:50,319
astronomers know
 

3025
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:51,829
astronomers know
that the earth

3026
00:53:51,829 --> 00:53:51,839
that the earth
 

3027
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:54,950
that the earth
is four and a half billion years old

3028
00:53:54,950 --> 00:53:54,960
is four and a half billion years old
 

3029
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,710
is four and a half billion years old
the sun has been shining for that length

3030
00:53:56,710 --> 00:53:56,720
the sun has been shining for that length
 

3031
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:59,270
the sun has been shining for that length
of time but the sun has got six billion

3032
00:53:59,270 --> 00:53:59,280
of time but the sun has got six billion
 

3033
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,829
of time but the sun has got six billion
years more to go before it flares up and

3034
00:54:01,829 --> 00:54:01,839
years more to go before it flares up and
 

3035
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:03,670
years more to go before it flares up and
engulfs the inner planet so science

3036
00:54:03,670 --> 00:54:03,680
engulfs the inner planet so science
 

3037
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:05,829
engulfs the inner planet so science
doesn't halfway through its life um and

3038
00:54:05,829 --> 00:54:05,839
doesn't halfway through its life um and
 

3039
00:54:05,839 --> 00:54:08,069
doesn't halfway through its life um and
uh the expanding universe

3040
00:54:08,069 --> 00:54:08,079
uh the expanding universe
 

3041
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:10,549
uh the expanding universe
goes on far longer still maybe forever

3042
00:54:10,549 --> 00:54:10,559
goes on far longer still maybe forever
 

3043
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:12,309
goes on far longer still maybe forever
and i like to quote woody allen who said

3044
00:54:12,309 --> 00:54:12,319
and i like to quote woody allen who said
 

3045
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:14,549
and i like to quote woody allen who said
eternity is very long especially towards

3046
00:54:14,549 --> 00:54:14,559
eternity is very long especially towards
 

3047
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:16,870
eternity is very long especially towards
the end uh so uh

3048
00:54:16,870 --> 00:54:16,880
the end uh so uh
 

3049
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,790
the end uh so uh
so we shouldn't think of ourselves as

3050
00:54:18,790 --> 00:54:18,800
so we shouldn't think of ourselves as
 

3051
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,870
so we shouldn't think of ourselves as
maybe even the halfway stage

3052
00:54:20,870 --> 00:54:20,880
maybe even the halfway stage
 

3053
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:24,150
maybe even the halfway stage
in the emergence of uh cosmic complexity

3054
00:54:24,150 --> 00:54:24,160
in the emergence of uh cosmic complexity
 

3055
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:27,910
in the emergence of uh cosmic complexity
and so these entities who are postcurses

3056
00:54:27,910 --> 00:54:27,920
and so these entities who are postcurses
 

3057
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:31,270
and so these entities who are postcurses
they will go beyond the solar system and

3058
00:54:31,270 --> 00:54:31,280
they will go beyond the solar system and
 

3059
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:32,549
they will go beyond the solar system and
of course even if there's nothing else

3060
00:54:32,549 --> 00:54:32,559
of course even if there's nothing else
 

3061
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:34,230
of course even if there's nothing else
out there already

3062
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:34,240
out there already
 

3063
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:35,589
out there already
then they could

3064
00:54:35,589 --> 00:54:35,599
then they could
 

3065
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:38,630
then they could
populate the rest of the galaxy

3066
00:54:38,630 --> 00:54:38,640
populate the rest of the galaxy
 

3067
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:40,789
populate the rest of the galaxy
and maybe eventually meet the others who

3068
00:54:40,789 --> 00:54:40,799
and maybe eventually meet the others who
 

3069
00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:42,710
and maybe eventually meet the others who
are out there expanding as well yeah

3070
00:54:42,710 --> 00:54:42,720
are out there expanding as well yeah
 

3071
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:44,710
are out there expanding as well yeah
expanding and populating yes with

3072
00:54:44,710 --> 00:54:44,720
expanding and populating yes with
 

3073
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,309
expanding and populating yes with
expanded

expanded
 

3075
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:49,430
expanded
uh capacity for life and intelligence

3076
00:54:49,430 --> 00:54:49,440
uh capacity for life and intelligence
 

3077
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,270
uh capacity for life and intelligence
all those kinds of things well they

3078
00:54:51,270 --> 00:54:51,280
all those kinds of things well they
 

3079
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:53,750
all those kinds of things well they
might um but um uh

3080
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:53,760
might um but um uh
 

3081
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:54,710

all better off because i can't conceive

what they'd be like
 

3087
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,710
what they'd be like
they won't they won't be uh um

green men and women with eyes on stalks
 

3093
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:04,870
green men and women with eyes on stalks
you know maybe something quite different

3094
00:55:04,870 --> 00:55:04,880
you know maybe something quite different
 

3095
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:05,750
you know maybe something quite different
um

3096
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:05,760
um
 

3097
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,910
um
we just don't know um but there is an

3098
00:55:07,910 --> 00:55:07,920
we just don't know um but there is an
 

3099
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:09,349
we just don't know um but there is an
interesting question actually which

3100
00:55:09,349 --> 00:55:09,359
interesting question actually which
 

3101
00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:11,109
interesting question actually which
comes up when i've sometimes spoken to

3102
00:55:11,109 --> 00:55:11,119
comes up when i've sometimes spoken to
 

3103
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:13,109
comes up when i've sometimes spoken to
audiences about this topic but the

3104
00:55:13,109 --> 00:55:13,119
audiences about this topic but the
 

3105
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:14,230
audiences about this topic but the
question of consciousness and

3106
00:55:14,230 --> 00:55:14,240
question of consciousness and
 

3107
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:16,710
question of consciousness and
self-awareness because you know going

3108
00:55:16,710 --> 00:55:16,720
self-awareness because you know going
 

3109
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,870
self-awareness because you know going
back to philosophical questions i mean

3110
00:55:18,870 --> 00:55:18,880
back to philosophical questions i mean
 

3111
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:22,630
back to philosophical questions i mean
whether an electronic robot

3112
00:55:22,630 --> 00:55:22,640
whether an electronic robot
 

3113
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:25,430
whether an electronic robot
would uh be a zombie or would it be

3114
00:55:25,430 --> 00:55:25,440
would uh be a zombie or would it be
 

3115
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,270
would uh be a zombie or would it be
conscious and self-aware

3116
00:55:27,270 --> 00:55:27,280
conscious and self-aware
 

3117
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:28,549
conscious and self-aware
and um

3118
00:55:28,549 --> 00:55:28,559
and um
 

3119
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:30,069
and um
i think there's no way of answering this

3120
00:55:30,069 --> 00:55:30,079
i think there's no way of answering this
 

3121
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:31,910
i think there's no way of answering this
empirically

3122
00:55:31,910 --> 00:55:31,920
empirically
 

3123
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:33,270
empirically
and

3124
00:55:33,270 --> 00:55:33,280
and
 

3125
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,589
and
some people think that consciousness and

3126
00:55:35,589 --> 00:55:35,599
some people think that consciousness and
 

3127
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:37,589
some people think that consciousness and
self-awareness is an emerging property

3128
00:55:37,589 --> 00:55:37,599
self-awareness is an emerging property
 

3129
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:39,670
self-awareness is an emerging property
in any sufficiently complicated networks

3130
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:39,680
in any sufficiently complicated networks
 

3131
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:42,069
in any sufficiently complicated networks
and they would be others say well maybe

3132
00:55:42,069 --> 00:55:42,079
and they would be others say well maybe
 

3133
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:44,150
and they would be others say well maybe
it's something special to the flesh and

3134
00:55:44,150 --> 00:55:44,160
it's something special to the flesh and
 

3135
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,150
it's something special to the flesh and
blood that we're made of we don't know

3136
00:55:46,150 --> 00:55:46,160
blood that we're made of we don't know
 

3137
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:47,190
blood that we're made of we don't know
um and

3138
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:47,200
um and
 

3139
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,910
um and
in a sense this may not matter um to the

3140
00:55:49,910 --> 00:55:49,920
in a sense this may not matter um to the
 

3141
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:52,710
in a sense this may not matter um to the
way peop things behave because we

3142
00:55:52,710 --> 00:55:52,720
way peop things behave because we
 

3143
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:54,630
way peop things behave because we
they could be zombies and still

3144
00:55:54,630 --> 00:55:54,640
they could be zombies and still
 

3145
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,230
they could be zombies and still
behave as though they were intelligent

3146
00:55:56,230 --> 00:55:56,240
behave as though they were intelligent
 

3147
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:59,030
behave as though they were intelligent
um but um i remember

3148
00:55:59,030 --> 00:55:59,040
um but um i remember
 

3149
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,789
um but um i remember
after one of my talks someone came up

3150
00:56:00,789 --> 00:56:00,799
after one of my talks someone came up
 

3151
00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:04,069
after one of my talks someone came up
and said wouldn't it be sad

3152
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:04,079
and said wouldn't it be sad
 

3153
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:05,430
and said wouldn't it be sad
if

3154
00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:05,440
if
 

3155
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,430
if
these future entities which were the

3156
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:07,440
these future entities which were the
 

3157
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:10,069
these future entities which were the
main intelligence universe um had no

3158
00:56:10,069 --> 00:56:10,079
main intelligence universe um had no
 

3159
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:12,309
main intelligence universe um had no
self-awareness so there was nothing

3160
00:56:12,309 --> 00:56:12,319
self-awareness so there was nothing
 

3161
00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:14,630
self-awareness so there was nothing
which could appreciate the wonder and

3162
00:56:14,630 --> 00:56:14,640
which could appreciate the wonder and
 

3163
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:16,390
which could appreciate the wonder and
mystery of the universe

3164
00:56:16,390 --> 00:56:16,400
mystery of the universe
 

3165
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,069
mystery of the universe
and the beauty of the universe in the

3166
00:56:18,069 --> 00:56:18,079
and the beauty of the universe in the
 

3167
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:19,430
and the beauty of the universe in the
way that we do

3168
00:56:19,430 --> 00:56:19,440
way that we do
 

3169
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:22,150
way that we do
um and so it does perhaps affect one's

3170
00:56:22,150 --> 00:56:22,160
um and so it does perhaps affect one's
 

3171
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,470
um and so it does perhaps affect one's
perspective of whether

3172
00:56:24,470 --> 00:56:24,480
perspective of whether
 

3173
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:27,030
perspective of whether
you welcome or deplore

3174
00:56:27,030 --> 00:56:27,040
you welcome or deplore
 

3175
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:29,109
you welcome or deplore
this possible future scenario depending

3176
00:56:29,109 --> 00:56:29,119
this possible future scenario depending
 

3177
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:31,270
this possible future scenario depending
on whether you think the the future

3178
00:56:31,270 --> 00:56:31,280
on whether you think the the future
 

3179
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:33,349
on whether you think the the future
post-human entities are

3180
00:56:33,349 --> 00:56:33,359
post-human entities are
 

3181
00:56:33,359 --> 00:56:36,069
post-human entities are
conscious and have an aesthetic sense or

3182
00:56:36,069 --> 00:56:36,079
conscious and have an aesthetic sense or
 

3183
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:38,069
conscious and have an aesthetic sense or
whether they're just zombies

3184
00:56:38,069 --> 00:56:38,079
whether they're just zombies
 

3185
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:41,270
whether they're just zombies
and uh of course you have to be humble

3186
00:56:41,270 --> 00:56:41,280
and uh of course you have to be humble
 

3187
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:42,870
and uh of course you have to be humble
to realize that

3188
00:56:42,870 --> 00:56:42,880
to realize that
 

3189
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:45,349
to realize that
self-awareness may not be the

3190
00:56:45,349 --> 00:56:45,359
self-awareness may not be the
 

3191
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:47,829
self-awareness may not be the
highest form of being

3192
00:56:47,829 --> 00:56:47,839
highest form of being
 

3193
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:48,870
highest form of being
that

3194
00:56:48,870 --> 00:56:48,880
that
 

3195
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:51,829
that
humans have a very strong ego

3196
00:56:51,829 --> 00:56:51,839
humans have a very strong ego
 

3197
00:56:51,839 --> 00:56:54,470
humans have a very strong ego
and a very strong sense of identity

3198
00:56:54,470 --> 00:56:54,480
and a very strong sense of identity
 

3199
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,549
and a very strong sense of identity
like personal identity connected to this

3200
00:56:56,549 --> 00:56:56,559
like personal identity connected to this
 

3201
00:56:56,559 --> 00:56:59,589
like personal identity connected to this
particular brain yeah uh it's not so

3202
00:56:59,589 --> 00:56:59,599
particular brain yeah uh it's not so
 

3203
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:01,910
particular brain yeah uh it's not so
obvious to me that that is somehow

3204
00:57:01,910 --> 00:57:01,920
obvious to me that that is somehow
 

3205
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:03,030
obvious to me that that is somehow
the

3206
00:57:03,030 --> 00:57:03,040
the
 

3207
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:05,270
the
the highest achievement

3208
00:57:05,270 --> 00:57:05,280
the highest achievement
 

3209
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:07,190
the highest achievement
of a life form

3210
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:07,200
of a life form
 

3211
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,349
of a life form
that maybe this kind of thing something

3212
00:57:09,349 --> 00:57:09,359
that maybe this kind of thing something
 

3213
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:11,829
that maybe this kind of thing something
collective would be it's possible that

3214
00:57:11,829 --> 00:57:11,839
collective would be it's possible that
 

3215
00:57:11,839 --> 00:57:12,950
collective would be it's possible that
uh

3216
00:57:12,950 --> 00:57:12,960
uh
 

3217
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:13,750
uh
well

3218
00:57:13,750 --> 00:57:13,760
well
 

3219
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,430
well
i think from an alien perspective when

3220
00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:15,440
i think from an alien perspective when
 

3221
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:17,190
i think from an alien perspective when
you look at earth

3222
00:57:17,190 --> 00:57:17,200
you look at earth
 

3223
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,710
you look at earth
it's not so obvious to me that

3224
00:57:18,710 --> 00:57:18,720
it's not so obvious to me that
 

3225
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:22,230
it's not so obvious to me that
individual humans are the atoms of

3226
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:22,240
individual humans are the atoms of
 

3227
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:24,549
individual humans are the atoms of
intelligence it could be the entire

3228
00:57:24,549 --> 00:57:24,559
intelligence it could be the entire
 

3229
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:26,150
intelligence it could be the entire
organism together the collective

3230
00:57:26,150 --> 00:57:26,160
organism together the collective
 

3231
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:28,309
organism together the collective
intelligence and so we humans think of

3232
00:57:28,309 --> 00:57:28,319
intelligence and so we humans think of
 

3233
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:30,230
intelligence and so we humans think of
ourselves as individuals we dress up we

3234
00:57:30,230 --> 00:57:30,240
ourselves as individuals we dress up we
 

3235
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,470
ourselves as individuals we dress up we
wear ties and suits and we give each

3236
00:57:32,470 --> 00:57:32,480
wear ties and suits and we give each
 

3237
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:35,270
wear ties and suits and we give each
other prizes but in reality

3238
00:57:35,270 --> 00:57:35,280
other prizes but in reality
 

3239
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,910
other prizes but in reality
the intelligence the things we create

3240
00:57:37,910 --> 00:57:37,920
the intelligence the things we create
 

3241
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:39,910
the intelligence the things we create
that are beautiful emerges from our

3242
00:57:39,910 --> 00:57:39,920
that are beautiful emerges from our
 

3243
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:42,230
that are beautiful emerges from our
interaction with each other and that may

3244
00:57:42,230 --> 00:57:42,240
interaction with each other and that may
 

3245
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:44,470
interaction with each other and that may
be where the intelligence is ideas

3246
00:57:44,470 --> 00:57:44,480
be where the intelligence is ideas
 

3247
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:46,470
be where the intelligence is ideas
jumping from one person to another over

3248
00:57:46,470 --> 00:57:46,480
jumping from one person to another over
 

3249
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:49,430
jumping from one person to another over
generations yes but we have experiences

3250
00:57:49,430 --> 00:57:49,440
generations yes but we have experiences
 

3251
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:50,950
generations yes but we have experiences
where we

3252
00:57:50,950 --> 00:57:50,960
where we
 

3253
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:53,910
where we
can appreciate yes beauty and wonder and

3254
00:57:53,910 --> 00:57:53,920
can appreciate yes beauty and wonder and
 

3255
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:56,150
can appreciate yes beauty and wonder and
all that and uh

3256
00:57:56,150 --> 00:57:56,160
all that and uh
 

3257
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:59,829
all that and uh
a zombie may not have those experiences

3258
00:57:59,829 --> 00:57:59,839
a zombie may not have those experiences
 

3259
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:01,910
a zombie may not have those experiences
yeah or it may have a very different

3260
00:58:01,910 --> 00:58:01,920
yeah or it may have a very different
 

3261
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:03,190
yeah or it may have a very different
they do have a very

3262
00:58:03,190 --> 00:58:03,200
they do have a very
 

3263
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:05,430
they do have a very
black and white harsh description of z

3264
00:58:05,430 --> 00:58:05,440
black and white harsh description of z
 

3265
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,910
black and white harsh description of z
like a philosophical zombie zombie that

3266
00:58:07,910 --> 00:58:07,920
like a philosophical zombie zombie that
 

3267
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:09,430
like a philosophical zombie zombie that
could be just a very different way to

3268
00:58:09,430 --> 00:58:09,440
could be just a very different way to
 

3269
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:13,910
could be just a very different way to
experience

3270
00:58:13,910 --> 00:58:13,920

 

3271
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:15,349

and you know

3272
00:58:15,349 --> 00:58:15,359
and you know
 

3273
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:18,390
and you know
in terms of the explorers that colonize

3274
00:58:18,390 --> 00:58:18,400
in terms of the explorers that colonize
 

3275
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:21,589
in terms of the explorers that colonize
mars

3276
00:58:21,589 --> 00:58:21,599

 

3277
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:22,710

i

3278
00:58:22,710 --> 00:58:22,720
i
 

3279
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:24,549
i
um i mean there's several things i want

3280
00:58:24,549 --> 00:58:24,559
um i mean there's several things i want
 

3281
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:26,630
um i mean there's several things i want
to mention one

3282
00:58:26,630 --> 00:58:26,640
to mention one
 

3283
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:28,390
to mention one
it's just at a high level to me that's

3284
00:58:28,390 --> 00:58:28,400
it's just at a high level to me that's
 

3285
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,309
it's just at a high level to me that's
one of the most inspiring things humans

3286
00:58:30,309 --> 00:58:30,319
one of the most inspiring things humans
 

3287
00:58:30,319 --> 00:58:31,349
one of the most inspiring things humans
can do

3288
00:58:31,349 --> 00:58:31,359
can do
 

3289
00:58:31,359 --> 00:58:34,150
can do
is reach out into the unknown that's in

3290
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:34,160
is reach out into the unknown that's in
 

3291
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:35,910
is reach out into the unknown that's in
the space of ideas in the space of

3292
00:58:35,910 --> 00:58:35,920
the space of ideas in the space of
 

3293
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:38,950
the space of ideas in the space of
science but also the explorers yes

3294
00:58:38,950 --> 00:58:38,960
science but also the explorers yes
 

3295
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:39,910
science but also the explorers yes
and that

3296
00:58:39,910 --> 00:58:39,920
and that
 

3297
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:43,030
and that
inspires people here on earth more

3298
00:58:43,030 --> 00:58:43,040
inspires people here on earth more
 

3299
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,549
inspires people here on earth more
i mean it did

3300
00:58:44,549 --> 00:58:44,559
i mean it did
 

3301
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:46,309
i mean it did
in their you know when going to the moon

3302
00:58:46,309 --> 00:58:46,319
in their you know when going to the moon
 

3303
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:48,069
in their you know when going to the moon
or going out to space in the 20th

3304
00:58:48,069 --> 00:58:48,079
or going out to space in the 20th
 

3305
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:49,910
or going out to space in the 20th
century that inspired a generation of

3306
00:58:49,910 --> 00:58:49,920
century that inspired a generation of
 

3307
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:51,030
century that inspired a generation of
scientists

3308
00:58:51,030 --> 00:58:51,040
scientists
 

3309
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:54,150
scientists
i think that also

3310
00:58:54,150 --> 00:58:54,160
i think that also
 

3311
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:56,870
i think that also
could be used to inspire a generation of

3312
00:58:56,870 --> 00:58:56,880
could be used to inspire a generation of
 

3313
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,870
could be used to inspire a generation of
new scientists in the 21st century by

3314
00:58:58,870 --> 00:58:58,880
new scientists in the 21st century by
 

3315
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:01,109
new scientists in the 21st century by
reaching authors mars so

3316
00:59:01,109 --> 00:59:01,119
reaching authors mars so
 

3317
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:03,750
reaching authors mars so
in that sense i think what elon musk and

3318
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:03,760
in that sense i think what elon musk and
 

3319
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:05,670
in that sense i think what elon musk and
others are doing is actually quite

3320
00:59:05,670 --> 00:59:05,680
others are doing is actually quite
 

3321
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:07,750
others are doing is actually quite
inspiring it's not well i agree

3322
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:07,760
inspiring it's not well i agree
 

3323
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:10,230
inspiring it's not well i agree
it's not a recreational thing it's

3324
00:59:10,230 --> 00:59:10,240
it's not a recreational thing it's
 

3325
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:13,030
it's not a recreational thing it's
actually has a deep humanitarian purpose

3326
00:59:13,030 --> 00:59:13,040
actually has a deep humanitarian purpose
 

3327
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:14,069
actually has a deep humanitarian purpose
of really

3328
00:59:14,069 --> 00:59:14,079
of really
 

3329
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:15,990
of really
inspiring the world

3330
00:59:15,990 --> 00:59:16,000
inspiring the world
 

3331
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,069
inspiring the world
and then on the other one to push back

3332
00:59:18,069 --> 00:59:18,079
and then on the other one to push back
 

3333
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:20,309
and then on the other one to push back
and your thought you know i don't think

3334
00:59:20,309 --> 00:59:20,319
and your thought you know i don't think
 

3335
00:59:20,319 --> 00:59:23,109
and your thought you know i don't think
elon says

3336
00:59:23,109 --> 00:59:23,119

 

3337
00:59:23,119 --> 00:59:26,390

we want to escape earth's problems

3338
00:59:26,390 --> 00:59:26,400
we want to escape earth's problems
 

3339
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,950
we want to escape earth's problems
it's more that we should allocate some

3340
00:59:28,950 --> 00:59:28,960
it's more that we should allocate some
 

3341
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:32,150
it's more that we should allocate some
small percentage of resources to have a

3342
00:59:32,150 --> 00:59:32,160
small percentage of resources to have a
 

3343
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:34,069
small percentage of resources to have a
back-up plan

3344
00:59:34,069 --> 00:59:34,079
back-up plan
 

3345
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:36,950
back-up plan
and because yes you yourself have spoken

3346
00:59:36,950 --> 00:59:36,960
and because yes you yourself have spoken
 

3347
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:38,950
and because yes you yourself have spoken
about and written about

3348
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:38,960
about and written about
 

3349
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:41,190
about and written about
all the ways we clever humans could

3350
00:59:41,190 --> 00:59:41,200
all the ways we clever humans could
 

3351
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:43,430
all the ways we clever humans could
destroy ourselves

3352
00:59:43,430 --> 00:59:43,440
destroy ourselves
 

3353
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:45,349
destroy ourselves
and i'm not sure

3354
00:59:45,349 --> 00:59:45,359
and i'm not sure
 

3355
00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:47,750
and i'm not sure
it does seem when you look at the long

3356
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:47,760
it does seem when you look at the long
 

3357
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:48,950
it does seem when you look at the long
arc

3358
00:59:48,950 --> 00:59:48,960
arc
 

3359
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,710
arc
of human history

3360
00:59:50,710 --> 00:59:50,720
of human history
 

3361
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:51,990
of human history
it seems

3362
00:59:51,990 --> 00:59:52,000
it seems
 

3363
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,990
it seems
almost obvious that we need to become a

3364
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:54,000
almost obvious that we need to become a
 

3365
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,190
almost obvious that we need to become a
multi-planetary species over a period if

3366
00:59:57,190 --> 00:59:57,200
multi-planetary species over a period if
 

3367
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:00,230
multi-planetary species over a period if
we are to survive many centuries

3368
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:00,240
we are to survive many centuries
 

3369
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:02,549
we are to survive many centuries
it seems that

3370
01:00:02,549 --> 01:00:02,559
it seems that
 

3371
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:04,630
it seems that
as we get clever and clever with the

3372
01:00:04,630 --> 01:00:04,640
as we get clever and clever with the
 

3373
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:06,630
as we get clever and clever with the
ways we can destroy ourselves

3374
01:00:06,630 --> 01:00:06,640
ways we can destroy ourselves
 

3375
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:08,309
ways we can destroy ourselves
earth is going to become less and less

3376
01:00:08,309 --> 01:00:08,319
earth is going to become less and less
 

3377
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:11,430
earth is going to become less and less
safe

3378
01:00:11,430 --> 01:00:11,440

 

3379
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:13,829

so in that sense

3380
01:00:13,829 --> 01:00:13,839
so in that sense
 

3381
01:00:13,839 --> 01:00:15,910
so in that sense
this is one of the things you know

3382
01:00:15,910 --> 01:00:15,920
this is one of the things you know
 

3383
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:18,150
this is one of the things you know
people talk about climate change

3384
01:00:18,150 --> 01:00:18,160
people talk about climate change
 

3385
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:19,670
people talk about climate change
and then we need to respond to climate

3386
01:00:19,670 --> 01:00:19,680
and then we need to respond to climate
 

3387
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:21,910
and then we need to respond to climate
change and that's a long-term investment

3388
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:21,920
change and that's a long-term investment
 

3389
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:24,150
change and that's a long-term investment
we need to make but it's not really long

3390
01:00:24,150 --> 01:00:24,160
we need to make but it's not really long
 

3391
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:27,030
we need to make but it's not really long
term it's a span of decades i think what

3392
01:00:27,030 --> 01:00:27,040
term it's a span of decades i think what
 

3393
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,349
term it's a span of decades i think what
elon is doing is a really long-term

3394
01:00:29,349 --> 01:00:29,359
elon is doing is a really long-term
 

3395
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:30,470
elon is doing is a really long-term
investment

3396
01:00:30,470 --> 01:00:30,480
investment
 

3397
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:32,950
investment
we should be working on multi-planetary

3398
01:00:32,950 --> 01:00:32,960
we should be working on multi-planetary
 

3399
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:35,589
we should be working on multi-planetary
colonization now if we were to have it

3400
01:00:35,589 --> 01:00:35,599
colonization now if we were to have it
 

3401
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:36,549
colonization now if we were to have it
ready

3402
01:00:36,549 --> 01:00:36,559
ready
 

3403
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:39,270
ready
five centuries from now and so taking

3404
01:00:39,270 --> 01:00:39,280
five centuries from now and so taking
 

3405
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:41,030
five centuries from now and so taking
those early steps

3406
01:00:41,030 --> 01:00:41,040
those early steps
 

3407
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:43,190
those early steps
and then also there's something happens

3408
01:00:43,190 --> 01:00:43,200
and then also there's something happens
 

3409
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:45,750
and then also there's something happens
when you're caught when you

3410
01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:45,760
when you're caught when you
 

3411
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:47,670
when you're caught when you
go into the unknown and do this really

3412
01:00:47,670 --> 01:00:47,680
go into the unknown and do this really
 

3413
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:50,230
go into the unknown and do this really
difficult thing you discover something

3414
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:50,240
difficult thing you discover something
 

3415
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:52,390
difficult thing you discover something
very new you discover something about

3416
01:00:52,390 --> 01:00:52,400
very new you discover something about
 

3417
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,829
very new you discover something about
robotics or materials engineering or

3418
01:00:54,829 --> 01:00:54,839
robotics or materials engineering or
 

3419
01:00:54,839 --> 01:00:57,589
robotics or materials engineering or
nutrition or neuroscience or human

3420
01:00:57,589 --> 01:00:57,599
nutrition or neuroscience or human
 

3421
01:00:57,599 --> 01:00:59,349
nutrition or neuroscience or human
relations or political systems that

3422
01:00:59,349 --> 01:00:59,359
relations or political systems that
 

3423
01:00:59,359 --> 01:01:01,270
relations or political systems that
actually work well with humans you

3424
01:01:01,270 --> 01:01:01,280
actually work well with humans you
 

3425
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:03,510
actually work well with humans you
discover all those things and so it's a

3426
01:01:03,510 --> 01:01:03,520
discover all those things and so it's a
 

3427
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:06,069
discover all those things and so it's a
it's worthy effort to go out there

3428
01:01:06,069 --> 01:01:06,079
it's worthy effort to go out there
 

3429
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:07,349
it's worthy effort to go out there
and uh

3430
01:01:07,349 --> 01:01:07,359
and uh
 

3431
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:09,990
and uh
try to become cyborgs

3432
01:01:09,990 --> 01:01:10,000
try to become cyborgs
 

3433
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,470
try to become cyborgs
yeah no i agree with that i think the

3434
01:01:12,470 --> 01:01:12,480
yeah no i agree with that i think the
 

3435
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:16,390
yeah no i agree with that i think the
only different point i'd make is that um

3436
01:01:16,390 --> 01:01:16,400
only different point i'd make is that um
 

3437
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:19,190
only different point i'd make is that um
this is going to be very expensive

3438
01:01:19,190 --> 01:01:19,200
this is going to be very expensive
 

3439
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:21,670
this is going to be very expensive
if it's done in a risk-averse way and

3440
01:01:21,670 --> 01:01:21,680
if it's done in a risk-averse way and
 

3441
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:23,750
if it's done in a risk-averse way and
that's why i think we should be grateful

3442
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:23,760
that's why i think we should be grateful
 

3443
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:26,390
that's why i think we should be grateful
to uh the billionaires if they're going

3444
01:01:26,390 --> 01:01:26,400
to uh the billionaires if they're going
 

3445
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:28,789
to uh the billionaires if they're going
to sort of foster um

3446
01:01:28,789 --> 01:01:28,799
to sort of foster um
 

3447
01:01:28,799 --> 01:01:31,829
to sort of foster um
these opportunities uh for uh

3448
01:01:31,829 --> 01:01:31,839
these opportunities uh for uh
 

3449
01:01:31,839 --> 01:01:34,710
these opportunities uh for uh
thrill-seeking uh risk-takers who we can

3450
01:01:34,710 --> 01:01:34,720
thrill-seeking uh risk-takers who we can
 

3451
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:37,030
thrill-seeking uh risk-takers who we can
all admire yeah by the way i should push

3452
01:01:37,030 --> 01:01:37,040
all admire yeah by the way i should push
 

3453
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:38,470
all admire yeah by the way i should push
back on the billionaires because there's

3454
01:01:38,470 --> 01:01:38,480
back on the billionaires because there's
 

3455
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:40,069
back on the billionaires because there's
sometimes a negative connotation to the

3456
01:01:40,069 --> 01:01:40,079
sometimes a negative connotation to the
 

3457
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:41,750
sometimes a negative connotation to the
world billionaire it's not a billionaire

3458
01:01:41,750 --> 01:01:41,760
world billionaire it's not a billionaire
 

3459
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:43,910
world billionaire it's not a billionaire
it's a company versus government because

3460
01:01:43,910 --> 01:01:43,920
it's a company versus government because
 

3461
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:45,670
it's a company versus government because
governments are billionaires and

3462
01:01:45,670 --> 01:01:45,680
governments are billionaires and
 

3463
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:47,750
governments are billionaires and
trillionaires yeah it's not it's not the

3464
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:47,760
trillionaires yeah it's not it's not the
 

3465
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:50,950
trillionaires yeah it's not it's not the
wealth it's the the capitalist

3466
01:01:50,950 --> 01:01:50,960
wealth it's the the capitalist
 

3467
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:52,710
wealth it's the the capitalist
uh imperative

3468
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:52,720
uh imperative
 

3469
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:54,150
uh imperative
so uh

3470
01:01:54,150 --> 01:01:54,160
so uh
 

3471
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:58,230
so uh
which i think

3472
01:01:58,230 --> 01:01:58,240

 

3473
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:00,309

deserves a lot more praise than people

3474
01:02:00,309 --> 01:02:00,319
deserves a lot more praise than people
 

3475
01:02:00,319 --> 01:02:01,510
deserves a lot more praise than people
are giving it

3476
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:01,520
are giving it
 

3477
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:03,349
are giving it
i'm i'm troubled by the sort of

3478
01:02:03,349 --> 01:02:03,359
i'm i'm troubled by the sort of
 

3479
01:02:03,359 --> 01:02:05,270
i'm i'm troubled by the sort of
criticism like it's billionaires playing

3480
01:02:05,270 --> 01:02:05,280
criticism like it's billionaires playing
 

3481
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:06,789
criticism like it's billionaires playing
with toys

3482
01:02:06,789 --> 01:02:06,799
with toys
 

3483
01:02:06,799 --> 01:02:08,789
with toys
for their own pleasure

3484
01:02:08,789 --> 01:02:08,799
for their own pleasure
 

3485
01:02:08,799 --> 01:02:09,750
for their own pleasure
i think

3486
01:02:09,750 --> 01:02:09,760
i think
 

3487
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:12,950
i think
what some of these companies like spacex

3488
01:02:12,950 --> 01:02:12,960
what some of these companies like spacex
 

3489
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:14,950
what some of these companies like spacex
and blue origin are doing

3490
01:02:14,950 --> 01:02:14,960
and blue origin are doing
 

3491
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:17,750
and blue origin are doing
is some of the most inspiring

3492
01:02:17,750 --> 01:02:17,760
is some of the most inspiring
 

3493
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:20,309
is some of the most inspiring
engineering and even scientific work

3494
01:02:20,309 --> 01:02:20,319
engineering and even scientific work
 

3495
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:23,670
engineering and even scientific work
ever done in human history no no i agree

3496
01:02:23,670 --> 01:02:23,680
ever done in human history no no i agree
 

3497
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:25,190
ever done in human history no no i agree
i think the people who've made the

3498
01:02:25,190 --> 01:02:25,200
i think the people who've made the
 

3499
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:27,510
i think the people who've made the
greatest wealth are people who've really

3500
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:27,520
greatest wealth are people who've really
 

3501
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:29,910
greatest wealth are people who've really
been mega benefactors i mean i think you

3504
01:02:31,109 --> 01:02:31,119
know
 

3505
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:33,109
know
some of them some of you yeah yeah some

3506
01:02:33,109 --> 01:02:33,119
some of them some of you yeah yeah some
 

3507

some of them some of you yeah yeah some
of them but but those who've

3508
01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:34,960
of them but but those who've
 

3509
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,230
of them but but those who've
founded um

3510
01:02:36,230 --> 01:02:36,240
founded um
 

3511
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:38,470
founded um
google and all that and uh and even

3512
01:02:38,470 --> 01:02:38,480
google and all that and uh and even
 

3513
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:40,230
google and all that and uh and even
amazon they're

3514
01:02:40,230 --> 01:02:40,240
amazon they're
 

3515
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:42,150
amazon they're
they're they're beneficiaries then

3516
01:02:42,150 --> 01:02:42,160
they're they're beneficiaries then
 

3517
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:44,069
they're they're beneficiaries then
they're quite different category in my

3518
01:02:44,069 --> 01:02:44,079
they're quite different category in my
 

3519
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:45,910
they're quite different category in my
view from those who just shuffle around

3520
01:02:45,910 --> 01:02:45,920
view from those who just shuffle around
 

3521
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:48,789
view from those who just shuffle around
money um or or

3522
01:02:48,789 --> 01:02:48,799
money um or or
 

3523
01:02:48,799 --> 01:02:51,510
money um or or
or um or crypto coins and things like

3524
01:02:51,510 --> 01:02:51,520
or um or crypto coins and things like
 

3525
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:53,270
or um or crypto coins and things like
that who are

3526
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:53,280
that who are
 

3527
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:55,670
that who are
now you're really talking trash yes

3528
01:02:55,670 --> 01:02:55,680
now you're really talking trash yes
 

3529
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:57,190
now you're really talking trash yes
but

3530
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:57,200
but
 

3531
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:58,309
but
but i think

3532
01:02:58,309 --> 01:02:58,319
but i think
 

3533
01:02:58,319 --> 01:02:59,990
but i think
if they use their money in these ways

3534
01:02:59,990 --> 01:03:00,000
if they use their money in these ways
 

3535
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,230
if they use their money in these ways
that's fine but but i think um it's true

3536
01:03:02,230 --> 01:03:02,240
that's fine but but i think um it's true
 

3537
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:03,829
that's fine but but i think um it's true
that the far more money is owned by us

3538
01:03:03,829 --> 01:03:03,839
that the far more money is owned by us
 

3539
01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:05,910
that the far more money is owned by us
collectively as taxpayers but i think

3540
01:03:05,910 --> 01:03:05,920
collectively as taxpayers but i think
 

3541
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:09,910
collectively as taxpayers but i think
the fact is it's in a democracy um

3542
01:03:09,910 --> 01:03:09,920
the fact is it's in a democracy um
 

3543
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:12,150
the fact is it's in a democracy um
to be big resistance

3544
01:03:12,150 --> 01:03:12,160
to be big resistance
 

3545
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:14,950
to be big resistance
to exposing human beings to very high

3546
01:03:14,950 --> 01:03:14,960
to exposing human beings to very high
 

3547
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:16,870
to exposing human beings to very high
risks if in a sense we share

3548
01:03:16,870 --> 01:03:16,880
risks if in a sense we share
 

3549
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:19,109
risks if in a sense we share
responsibility for it yeah i don't know

3550
01:03:19,109 --> 01:03:19,119
responsibility for it yeah i don't know
 

3551
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:20,470
responsibility for it yeah i don't know
and that's that's the reason i think

3552
01:03:20,470 --> 01:03:20,480
and that's that's the reason i think
 

3553
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:22,710
and that's that's the reason i think
it'll be done much more cheaply by

3554
01:03:22,710 --> 01:03:22,720
it'll be done much more cheaply by
 

3555
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:24,870
it'll be done much more cheaply by
by these private funders that's an

3556
01:03:24,870 --> 01:03:24,880
by these private funders that's an
 

3557
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:26,630
by these private funders that's an
interesting hypothesis but i have to

3558
01:03:26,630 --> 01:03:26,640
interesting hypothesis but i have to
 

3559
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:27,750
interesting hypothesis but i have to
push back

3560
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:27,760
push back
 

3561
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:30,390
push back
i don't know if it's obvious why nasa

3562
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:30,400
i don't know if it's obvious why nasa
 

3563
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:32,710
i don't know if it's obvious why nasa
spends so much money

3564
01:03:32,710 --> 01:03:32,720
spends so much money
 

3565
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:36,309
spends so much money
and takes such a long time

3566
01:03:36,309 --> 01:03:36,319
and takes such a long time
 

3567
01:03:36,319 --> 01:03:38,470
and takes such a long time
to develop the things he was doing so

3568
01:03:38,470 --> 01:03:38,480
to develop the things he was doing so

elon is able to do this
 

3589
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,470
elon is able to do this
much cheaper much faster

01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:04,710
much cheaper much faster
it could have to be do with risk

3592
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:04,720
it could have to be do with risk
 

3593
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:07,270
it could have to be do with risk

01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:13,109
it's it's the uh
it's that it's that he had all the um uh

3598
01:04:13,109 --> 01:04:13,119
it's that it's that he had all the um uh
 

3599
01:04:13,119 --> 01:04:14,710
it's that it's that he had all the um uh
the whole assembly within this one

3600
01:04:14,710 --> 01:04:14,720
the whole assembly within this one
 

3601
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:16,230
the whole assembly within this one
building as it were rather than

3602
01:04:16,230 --> 01:04:16,240
building as it were rather than
 

3603
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:18,390
building as it were rather than
depending on a supply chain um but i

3604
01:04:18,390 --> 01:04:18,400
depending on a supply chain um but i
 

3605
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:21,349
depending on a supply chain um but i
think it's also uh that he um had a

3606
01:04:21,349 --> 01:04:21,359
think it's also uh that he um had a
 

3607
01:04:21,359 --> 01:04:22,950
think it's also uh that he um had a
silicon valley culture and a younger

3608
01:04:22,950 --> 01:04:22,960
silicon valley culture and a younger
 

3609
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:25,510
silicon valley culture and a younger
people whereas um the the big aerospace

3610
01:04:25,510 --> 01:04:25,520
people whereas um the the big aerospace
 

3611
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:28,710
people whereas um the the big aerospace
companies boeing and lockheed martin um

3612
01:04:28,710 --> 01:04:28,720
companies boeing and lockheed martin um
 

3613
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:30,390
companies boeing and lockheed martin um
they had people who were left over from

3614
01:04:30,390 --> 01:04:30,400
they had people who were left over from
 

3615
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:32,950
they had people who were left over from
the apollo program in some cases and and

3616
01:04:32,950 --> 01:04:32,960
the apollo program in some cases and and
 

3617
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:35,270
the apollo program in some cases and and
so they weren't quite quite so lively

3618
01:04:35,270 --> 01:04:35,280
so they weren't quite quite so lively
 

3619
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:38,069
so they weren't quite quite so lively
and indeed um quite apart from the

3620
01:04:38,069 --> 01:04:38,079
and indeed um quite apart from the
 

3621
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:39,670
and indeed um quite apart from the
controversial issues of the future of

3622
01:04:39,670 --> 01:04:39,680
controversial issues of the future of
 

3623
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:43,109
controversial issues of the future of
human space flights um in terms of the

3624
01:04:43,109 --> 01:04:43,119
human space flights um in terms of the
 

3625
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:45,430
human space flights um in terms of the
next generation of big rockets

3626
01:04:45,430 --> 01:04:45,440
next generation of big rockets
 

3627
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:47,990
next generation of big rockets
then uh the one that uh musk is going to

3628
01:04:47,990 --> 01:04:48,000
then uh the one that uh musk is going to
 

3629
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,390
then uh the one that uh musk is going to
launch for the first time this year

3630
01:04:50,390 --> 01:04:50,400
launch for the first time this year
 

3631
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:53,430
launch for the first time this year
um the huge one um it's going to be far

3632
01:04:53,430 --> 01:04:53,440
um the huge one um it's going to be far
 

3633
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:54,870
um the huge one um it's going to be far
far cheaper

3634
01:04:54,870 --> 01:04:54,880
far cheaper
 

3635
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:57,910
far cheaper
than the one that nasa's been working on

3636
01:04:57,910 --> 01:04:57,920
than the one that nasa's been working on
 

3637
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:00,470
than the one that nasa's been working on
at the same time um and that's because

3638
01:05:00,470 --> 01:05:00,480
at the same time um and that's because
 

3639
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:03,270
at the same time um and that's because
it will have a reusable first stage

3640
01:05:03,270 --> 01:05:03,280
it will have a reusable first stage
 

3641
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:05,670
it will have a reusable first stage
and it's going to be great it can launch

3642
01:05:05,670 --> 01:05:05,680
and it's going to be great it can launch
 

3643
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:07,589
and it's going to be great it can launch
over 100 tons

3644
01:05:07,589 --> 01:05:07,599
over 100 tons
 

3645
01:05:07,599 --> 01:05:09,190
over 100 tons
into earth orbit

3646
01:05:09,190 --> 01:05:09,200
into earth orbit
 

3647
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:11,190
into earth orbit
and instead that's going to be

3648
01:05:11,190 --> 01:05:11,200
and instead that's going to be
 

3649
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:13,349
and instead that's going to be
make it feasible to do things that i

3650
01:05:13,349 --> 01:05:13,359
make it feasible to do things that i
 

3651
01:05:13,359 --> 01:05:14,789
make it feasible to do things that i
used to think were crazy like having

3652
01:05:14,789 --> 01:05:14,799
used to think were crazy like having
 

3653
01:05:14,799 --> 01:05:17,349
used to think were crazy like having
solar energy from space that's no longer

3654
01:05:17,349 --> 01:05:17,359
solar energy from space that's no longer
 

3655
01:05:17,359 --> 01:05:19,829
solar energy from space that's no longer
so crazy if you can do that

3656
01:05:19,829 --> 01:05:19,839
so crazy if you can do that
 

3657
01:05:19,839 --> 01:05:21,270
so crazy if you can do that
and also

3658
01:05:21,270 --> 01:05:21,280
and also
 

3659
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:24,630
and also
for science because um its nose cone

3660
01:05:24,630 --> 01:05:24,640
for science because um its nose cone
 

3661
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:25,990
for science because um its nose cone
could

3662
01:05:25,990 --> 01:05:26,000
could
 

3663
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,589
could
contain within it

3664
01:05:27,589 --> 01:05:27,599
contain within it
 

3665
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:30,390
contain within it
something uh as big as the entire

3666
01:05:30,390 --> 01:05:30,400
something uh as big as the entire
 

3667
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:33,670
something uh as big as the entire
unfurled james webb telescope mirror

3668
01:05:33,670 --> 01:05:33,680
unfurled james webb telescope mirror
 

3669
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:35,190
unfurled james webb telescope mirror
and therefore you can

3670
01:05:35,190 --> 01:05:35,200
and therefore you can
 

3671
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:37,190
and therefore you can
have a big telescope much more cheaply

3672
01:05:37,190 --> 01:05:37,200
have a big telescope much more cheaply
 

3673
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:39,109
have a big telescope much more cheaply
if you can launch it all in one piece

3674
01:05:39,109 --> 01:05:39,119
if you can launch it all in one piece
 

3675
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:41,190
if you can launch it all in one piece
and so it's going to be hugely

3676
01:05:41,190 --> 01:05:41,200
and so it's going to be hugely
 

3677
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:43,430
and so it's going to be hugely
beneficial to science and to any

3678
01:05:43,430 --> 01:05:43,440
beneficial to science and to any
 

3679
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:45,750
beneficial to science and to any
practical use of space to have these

3680
01:05:45,750 --> 01:05:45,760
practical use of space to have these
 

3681
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:47,990
practical use of space to have these
cheaper rockets that are far more

3682
01:05:47,990 --> 01:05:48,000
cheaper rockets that are far more
 

3683
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,069
cheaper rockets that are far more
completely reusable than anyways nasa

3684
01:05:50,069 --> 01:05:50,079
completely reusable than anyways nasa
 

3685
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:52,950
completely reusable than anyways nasa
had so i think mosques are a tremendous

3686
01:05:52,950 --> 01:05:52,960
had so i think mosques are a tremendous
 

3687
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:56,309
had so i think mosques are a tremendous
service to the space exploration and the

3688
01:05:56,309 --> 01:05:56,319
service to the space exploration and the
 

3689
01:05:56,319 --> 01:05:58,150
service to the space exploration and the
whole space technology through these

3690
01:05:58,150 --> 01:05:58,160
whole space technology through these
 

3691
01:05:58,160 --> 01:05:59,750
whole space technology through these
rockets certainly

3692
01:05:59,750 --> 01:05:59,760
rockets certainly
 

3693
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:03,510
rockets certainly
plus it's some big sexy rocket it's just

3694
01:06:03,510 --> 01:06:03,520
plus it's some big sexy rocket it's just
 

3695
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:05,750
plus it's some big sexy rocket it's just
great engineering of course yeah it's

3696
01:06:05,750 --> 01:06:05,760
great engineering of course yeah it's
 

3697
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:08,150
great engineering of course yeah it's
like looking at a beautiful big bridge

3698
01:06:08,150 --> 01:06:08,160
like looking at a beautiful big bridge
 

3699
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:10,309
like looking at a beautiful big bridge
that humans are capable us descendants

3700
01:06:10,309 --> 01:06:10,319
that humans are capable us descendants
 

3701
01:06:10,319 --> 01:06:12,150
that humans are capable us descendants
of apes are capable to do something so

3702
01:06:12,150 --> 01:06:12,160
of apes are capable to do something so
 

3703
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:14,470
of apes are capable to do something so
majestic yes uh and also the way they

3704
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:14,480
majestic yes uh and also the way they
 

3705
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:16,150
majestic yes uh and also the way they
land coming down on this bar that's

3706
01:06:16,150 --> 01:06:16,160
land coming down on this bar that's
 

3707
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:18,549
land coming down on this bar that's
amazing it's both controls engineering

3708
01:06:18,549 --> 01:06:18,559
amazing it's both controls engineering
 

3709
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:19,510
amazing it's both controls engineering
it's

3710
01:06:19,510 --> 01:06:19,520
it's
 

3711
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:20,630
it's
um

3712
01:06:20,630 --> 01:06:20,640
um
 

3713
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:22,710
um
increasing sort of intelligence in these

3714
01:06:22,710 --> 01:06:22,720
increasing sort of intelligence in these
 

3715
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:24,230
increasing sort of intelligence in these
rockets but also

3716
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:24,240
rockets but also
 

3717
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:27,430
rockets but also
great propulsion engineering materials

3718
01:06:27,430 --> 01:06:27,440
great propulsion engineering materials
 

3719
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:29,270
great propulsion engineering materials
uh enough in your ship and it just

3720
01:06:29,270 --> 01:06:29,280
uh enough in your ship and it just
 

3721
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:30,470
uh enough in your ship and it just
inspires

3722
01:06:30,470 --> 01:06:30,480
inspires
 

3723
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:32,390
inspires
it just inspires so many people no i'm

3724
01:06:32,390 --> 01:06:32,400
it just inspires so many people no i'm
 

3725
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:35,029
it just inspires so many people no i'm
entirely with you on that yeah

3726
01:06:35,029 --> 01:06:35,039
entirely with you on that yeah
 

3727
01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:35,990
entirely with you on that yeah
so

3728
01:06:35,990 --> 01:06:36,000
so
 

3729
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,990
so
would it be exciting to you to see a

3730
01:06:37,990 --> 01:06:38,000
would it be exciting to you to see a
 

3731
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,150
would it be exciting to you to see a
human being step foot on mars in your

3732
01:06:40,150 --> 01:06:40,160
human being step foot on mars in your
 

3733
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:41,430
human being step foot on mars in your
lifetime

3734
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:41,440
lifetime
 

3735
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:43,270
lifetime
yes i think it's unlikely in my lifetime

3736
01:06:43,270 --> 01:06:43,280
yes i think it's unlikely in my lifetime
 

3737
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:45,990
yes i think it's unlikely in my lifetime
since i'm i'm so ancient but uh but i

3738
01:06:45,990 --> 01:06:46,000
since i'm i'm so ancient but uh but i
 

3739
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,750
since i'm i'm so ancient but uh but i
think this this century is going to

3740
01:06:47,750 --> 01:06:47,760
think this this century is going to
 

3741
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:50,309
think this this century is going to
happen and i think that that will indeed

3742
01:06:50,309 --> 01:06:50,319
happen and i think that that will indeed
 

3743
01:06:50,319 --> 01:06:52,549
happen and i think that that will indeed
be exciting and uh uh i hope there will

3744
01:06:52,549 --> 01:06:52,559
be exciting and uh uh i hope there will
 

3745
01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:54,230
be exciting and uh uh i hope there will
be a small community by the end of a

3746
01:06:54,230 --> 01:06:54,240
be a small community by the end of a
 

3747
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:57,029
be a small community by the end of a
century but as as i say i think they

3748
01:06:57,029 --> 01:06:57,039
century but as as i say i think they
 

3749
01:06:57,039 --> 01:06:58,470
century but as as i say i think they
they may

3750
01:06:58,470 --> 01:06:58,480
they may
 

3751
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:01,029
they may
go with one-way tickets or accepting the

3752
01:07:01,029 --> 01:07:01,039
go with one-way tickets or accepting the
 

3753
01:07:01,039 --> 01:07:04,390
go with one-way tickets or accepting the
risk of of uh of no return and so

3754
01:07:04,390 --> 01:07:04,400
risk of of uh of no return and so
 

3755
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:06,870
risk of of uh of no return and so
they've got to be people like that and

3756
01:07:06,870 --> 01:07:06,880
they've got to be people like that and
 

3757
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:09,349
they've got to be people like that and
uh i still think it's going to be

3758
01:07:09,349 --> 01:07:09,359
uh i still think it's going to be
 

3759
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:11,750
uh i still think it's going to be
hard to persuade the public

3760
01:07:11,750 --> 01:07:11,760
hard to persuade the public
 

3761
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:14,390
hard to persuade the public
to send people when you say straight out

3762
01:07:14,390 --> 01:07:14,400
to send people when you say straight out
 

3763
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:16,710
to send people when you say straight out
that they may never come back

3764
01:07:16,710 --> 01:07:16,720
that they may never come back
 

3765
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:19,349
that they may never come back
um but uh of course the apollo

um but uh of course the apollo
 

3767
01:07:19,359 --> 01:07:21,109
um but uh of course the apollo
astronauts they took a high risk and in

you know
about

3786
01:07:40,870 --> 01:07:40,880
about
 

3787
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:43,190
about
how they would have come to a noble end

3788

etc um but of course there was a genuine
 

3791
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:48,710
etc um but of course there was a genuine
risk at that time um but

3792
01:07:48,710 --> 01:07:48,720
risk at that time um but
 

3793
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:50,230
risk at that time um but
but

3794
01:07:50,230 --> 01:07:50,240
but
 

3795
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:51,270
but
that

3796
01:07:51,270 --> 01:07:51,280
that
 

3797
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:53,190
that
may have been accepted but

may have been accepted but
 

3799
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:54,950
may have been accepted but
um clearly the

3800
01:07:54,950 --> 01:07:54,960
um clearly the
 

3801
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:57,190
um clearly the
crashes of the shuttle

3802
01:07:57,190 --> 01:07:57,200
crashes of the shuttle
 

3803
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:59,190
crashes of the shuttle
were not acceptable to the american

3804
01:07:59,190 --> 01:07:59,200
were not acceptable to the american
 

3805
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,230
were not acceptable to the american
public

3806
01:08:00,230 --> 01:08:00,240
public
 

3807
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:01,829
public
even when they were told that this was

3808
01:08:01,829 --> 01:08:01,839
even when they were told that this was
 

3809
01:08:01,839 --> 01:08:04,390
even when they were told that this was
only a two percent risk given how often

3810
01:08:04,390 --> 01:08:04,400
only a two percent risk given how often
 

3811
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:06,630
only a two percent risk given how often
they launched it and so that's what

3812
01:08:06,630 --> 01:08:06,640
they launched it and so that's what
 

3813
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:09,750
they launched it and so that's what
leads me to think that um

3814
01:08:09,750 --> 01:08:09,760
leads me to think that um
 

3815
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:12,710
leads me to think that um
it's got to be left to the kind of

3816
01:08:12,710 --> 01:08:12,720
it's got to be left to the kind of
 

3817
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:15,190
it's got to be left to the kind of
um people who are prepared to take these

3818
01:08:15,190 --> 01:08:15,200
um people who are prepared to take these
 

3819
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:18,229
um people who are prepared to take these
risks and i think um uh think of america

3820
01:08:18,229 --> 01:08:18,239
risks and i think um uh think of america
 

3821
01:08:18,239 --> 01:08:19,990
risks and i think um uh think of america

for something that's
i would i might want to be even older

3872

than i am now
 

3875
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:18,950

01:09:18,950 --> 01:09:18,960
but then i would go i guess what i'm
 

3877

01:09:24,149 --> 01:09:24,159
the nice feature and i'm sure there's
 

3883
01:09:24,159 --> 01:09:26,309
the nice feature and i'm sure there's
going to be a significant percentage or

3884
01:09:26,309 --> 01:09:26,319
going to be a significant percentage or
 

3885
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:28,309

01:09:36,149 --> 01:09:36,159
so and i i particularly love that that
 

3891
01:09:36,159 --> 01:09:37,990
so and i i particularly love that that

especially among the young minds is uh

3898
01:09:43,910 --> 01:09:43,920
especially among the young minds is uh
 

3899
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:45,669
especially among the young minds is uh
perhaps immeasurable

3900
01:09:45,669 --> 01:09:45,679
perhaps immeasurable
 

3901
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:46,470
perhaps immeasurable
but

3902
01:09:46,470 --> 01:09:46,480
but
 

3903
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:50,309
but
you're thinking um

3904
01:09:50,309 --> 01:09:50,319

 

3905
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:51,269

that

3906
01:09:51,269 --> 01:09:51,279
that
 

3907
01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:53,349
that
sending humans

3908
01:09:53,349 --> 01:09:53,359
sending humans
 

3909
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:55,270
sending humans
should be something we do less and less

3910
01:09:55,270 --> 01:09:55,280
should be something we do less and less
 

3911
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:57,350
should be something we do less and less
sending humans to space that it should

3912
01:09:57,350 --> 01:09:57,360
sending humans to space that it should
 

3913
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:59,910
sending humans to space that it should
be primarily an effort

3914
01:09:59,910 --> 01:09:59,920
be primarily an effort
 

3915
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:00,630
be primarily an effort
the

3916
01:10:00,630 --> 01:10:00,640
the
 

3917
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:02,790
the
the work of space exploration should be

3918
01:10:02,790 --> 01:10:02,800
the work of space exploration should be
 

3919
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:05,189
the work of space exploration should be
done primarily by robots well i think it

3920
01:10:05,189 --> 01:10:05,199
done primarily by robots well i think it
 

3921
01:10:05,199 --> 01:10:06,709
done primarily by robots well i think it
it can be done much more cheaply

3922
01:10:06,709 --> 01:10:06,719
it can be done much more cheaply
 

3923
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:09,510
it can be done much more cheaply
obviously on on mars and uh

3924
01:10:09,510 --> 01:10:09,520
obviously on on mars and uh
 

3925
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:11,430
obviously on on mars and uh
no one's thinking of sending humans to

3926
01:10:11,430 --> 01:10:11,440
no one's thinking of sending humans to
 

3927
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:13,750
no one's thinking of sending humans to
enceladus or europa

3928
01:10:13,750 --> 01:10:13,760
enceladus or europa
 

3929
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:16,709
enceladus or europa
the outer planets um and uh

3930
01:10:16,709 --> 01:10:16,719
the outer planets um and uh
 

3931
01:10:16,719 --> 01:10:18,630
the outer planets um and uh
and the point is we'll have much better

3932
01:10:18,630 --> 01:10:18,640
and the point is we'll have much better
 

3933
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:20,550
and the point is we'll have much better
uh robots because um

3934
01:10:20,550 --> 01:10:20,560
uh robots because um
 

3935
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:23,189
uh robots because um
let's take an example um uh you see

3936
01:10:23,189 --> 01:10:23,199
let's take an example um uh you see
 

3937
01:10:23,199 --> 01:10:25,910
let's take an example um uh you see
these pictures of um

3938
01:10:25,910 --> 01:10:25,920
these pictures of um
 

3939
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:28,229
these pictures of um
the moons of saturn and the picture of

3940
01:10:28,229 --> 01:10:28,239
the moons of saturn and the picture of
 

3941
01:10:28,239 --> 01:10:29,350
the moons of saturn and the picture of
pluto

3942
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:29,360
pluto
 

3943
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:32,149
pluto
and the comet taken by uh

3944
01:10:32,149 --> 01:10:32,159
and the comet taken by uh
 

3945
01:10:32,159 --> 01:10:35,990
and the comet taken by uh
probes and cassini spent 13 years

3946
01:10:35,990 --> 01:10:36,000
probes and cassini spent 13 years
 

3947
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,470
probes and cassini spent 13 years
going around saturn and his moons after

3948
01:10:38,470 --> 01:10:38,480
going around saturn and his moons after
 

3949
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:40,229
going around saturn and his moons after
seven year voyage and those are all

3950
01:10:40,229 --> 01:10:40,239
seven year voyage and those are all
 

3951
01:10:40,239 --> 01:10:42,870
seven year voyage and those are all
based on 1990s technology and if you

3952
01:10:42,870 --> 01:10:42,880
based on 1990s technology and if you
 

3953
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:44,630
based on 1990s technology and if you
think of how smartphones have advanced

3954
01:10:44,630 --> 01:10:44,640
think of how smartphones have advanced
 

3955
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:46,790
think of how smartphones have advanced
in 20 years since then does think how

3956
01:10:46,790 --> 01:10:46,800
in 20 years since then does think how
 

3957
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:48,550
in 20 years since then does think how
much better one could do

3958
01:10:48,550 --> 01:10:48,560
much better one could do
 

3959
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:50,310
much better one could do
instrumenting some very small

3960
01:10:50,310 --> 01:10:50,320
instrumenting some very small
 

3961
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:52,470
instrumenting some very small
sophisticated probe and could send

3962
01:10:52,470 --> 01:10:52,480
sophisticated probe and could send
 

3963
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:54,630
sophisticated probe and could send
dozens of them to explore the outer

3964
01:10:54,630 --> 01:10:54,640
dozens of them to explore the outer
 

3965
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:56,229
dozens of them to explore the outer
planets and that's that's the way to do

3966
01:10:56,229 --> 01:10:56,239
planets and that's that's the way to do
 

3967
01:10:56,239 --> 01:10:58,149
planets and that's that's the way to do
that because no one thinks you could

3968
01:10:58,149 --> 01:10:58,159
that because no one thinks you could
 

3969
01:10:58,159 --> 01:11:01,030
that because no one thinks you could
send humans that far um and uh but i

3970
01:11:01,030 --> 01:11:01,040
send humans that far um and uh but i
 

3971
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:02,950
send humans that far um and uh but i
would apply the same argument to

3972
01:11:02,950 --> 01:11:02,960
would apply the same argument to
 

3973
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:04,470
would apply the same argument to
to uh mars

3974
01:11:04,470 --> 01:11:04,480
to uh mars
 

3975
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:06,149
to uh mars
and if you want to assemble big

3976
01:11:06,149 --> 01:11:06,159
and if you want to assemble big
 

3977
01:11:06,159 --> 01:11:07,830
and if you want to assemble big
structures like um

3978
01:11:07,830 --> 01:11:07,840
structures like um
 

3979
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:09,030
structures like um
for instance radio astronomers would

3980
01:11:09,030 --> 01:11:09,040
for instance radio astronomers would
 

3981
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:10,870
for instance radio astronomers would
like to have a big radio telescope on

3982
01:11:10,870 --> 01:11:10,880
like to have a big radio telescope on
 

3983
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:12,950
like to have a big radio telescope on
the far side of the moon so it's away

3984
01:11:12,950 --> 01:11:12,960
the far side of the moon so it's away
 

3985
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:13,910
the far side of the moon so it's away
from the

3986
01:11:13,910 --> 01:11:13,920
from the
 

3987
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:15,669
from the
earth's

3988
01:11:15,669 --> 01:11:15,679
earth's
 

3989
01:11:15,679 --> 01:11:19,350
earth's
background artificial radio waves um and

3990
01:11:19,350 --> 01:11:19,360
background artificial radio waves um and
 

3991
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:20,630
background artificial radio waves um and
that could be

3992
01:11:20,630 --> 01:11:20,640
that could be
 

3993
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:22,630
that could be
done by assembling

3994
01:11:22,630 --> 01:11:22,640
done by assembling
 

3995
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:25,350
done by assembling
using robots without people so

3996
01:11:25,350 --> 01:11:25,360
using robots without people so
 

3997
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:27,350
using robots without people so
on the moon and on mars

3998
01:11:27,350 --> 01:11:27,360
on the moon and on mars
 

3999
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:29,510
on the moon and on mars
um i think

4000
01:11:29,510 --> 01:11:29,520
um i think
 

4001
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:32,070
um i think
everything that's useful can be done by

4002
01:11:32,070 --> 01:11:32,080
everything that's useful can be done by
 

4003
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:33,910
everything that's useful can be done by
machines much more cheaply than by

4004
01:11:33,910 --> 01:11:33,920
machines much more cheaply than by
 

4005
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:35,830
machines much more cheaply than by
humans

4006
01:11:35,830 --> 01:11:35,840
humans
 

4007
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:38,229
humans
do you know the movie 2001 a space

4008
01:11:38,229 --> 01:11:38,239
do you know the movie 2001 a space
 

4009
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:40,470
do you know the movie 2001 a space
odyssey of course yes

4010
01:11:40,470 --> 01:11:40,480
odyssey of course yes
 

4011
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:42,709
odyssey of course yes
uh you must be too young to see that

4012
01:11:42,709 --> 01:11:42,719
uh you must be too young to see that
 

4013
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:44,790
uh you must be too young to see that
when he came out obviously uh yeah i

4014
01:11:44,790 --> 01:11:44,800
when he came out obviously uh yeah i
 

4015
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,790
when he came out obviously uh yeah i
remember seeing when it came out

4016
01:11:46,790 --> 01:11:46,800
remember seeing when it came out
 

4017
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:48,790
remember seeing when it came out
you saw when he came out

4018
01:11:48,790 --> 01:11:48,800
you saw when he came out
 

4019
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:51,750
you saw when he came out
yeah yeah fifty years ago sixty what was

4020
01:11:51,750 --> 01:11:51,760
yeah yeah fifty years ago sixty what was
 

4021
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:55,110
yeah yeah fifty years ago sixty what was
the 60 yeah it was in the 60s yeah

4022
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:55,120
the 60 yeah it was in the 60s yeah
 

4023
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:56,149
the 60 yeah it was in the 60s yeah
that's right

4024
01:11:56,149 --> 01:11:56,159
that's right
 

4025
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:58,310
that's right
and still classic

4026
01:11:58,310 --> 01:11:58,320
and still classic
 

4027
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:00,070
and still classic
it's still probably

4028
01:12:00,070 --> 01:12:00,080
it's still probably
 

4029
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:01,030
it's still probably
i don't know

4030
01:12:01,030 --> 01:12:01,040
i don't know
 

4031
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:03,990
i don't know
the greatest ai movie ever made yes yes

4032
01:12:03,990 --> 01:12:04,000
the greatest ai movie ever made yes yes
 

4033
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,229
the greatest ai movie ever made yes yes
i agree one of the great space movies

4034
01:12:06,229 --> 01:12:06,239
i agree one of the great space movies
 

4035
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:08,950
i agree one of the great space movies
ever made yes so

4036
01:12:08,950 --> 01:12:08,960
ever made yes so
 

4037
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:10,470
ever made yes so
well let me ask you a philosophical

4038
01:12:10,470 --> 01:12:10,480
well let me ask you a philosophical
 

4039
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:11,750
well let me ask you a philosophical
question since we're talking about

4040
01:12:11,750 --> 01:12:11,760
question since we're talking about
 

4041
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:14,149
question since we're talking about
robots exploring space do you think hal

4042
01:12:14,149 --> 01:12:14,159

4062
01:12:36,470 --> 01:12:36,480
of the mission um do you think hal is
 

4063
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:38,149
of the mission um do you think hal is
good or evil

if you ask me probably in that context
 

4067
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:42,229
if you ask me probably in that context
it was probably good but i think you're

01:12:42,229 --> 01:12:42,239
it was probably good but i think you're

any important decision

4078
01:12:54,470 --> 01:12:54,480
any important decision
 

4079
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:57,270
any important decision
uh to a machine and there again i'm very

4080
01:12:57,270 --> 01:12:57,280
uh to a machine and there again i'm very
 

4081
01:12:57,280 --> 01:13:00,390
uh to a machine and there again i'm very
worried because i think um if you are

4082
01:13:00,390 --> 01:13:00,400
worried because i think um if you are
 

4083
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:03,110
worried because i think um if you are
recommended for an operation

4084
01:13:03,110 --> 01:13:03,120
recommended for an operation
 

4085
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:06,070

you feel you

4090
01:13:10,709 --> 01:13:10,719
you feel you
 

4091
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:13,030
you feel you
should be entitled to an explanation

4092
01:13:13,030 --> 01:13:13,040
should be entitled to an explanation
 

4093
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:14,709
should be entitled to an explanation
it's not enough to be told that the

4094
01:13:14,709 --> 01:13:14,719
it's not enough to be told that the
 

4095
01:13:14,719 --> 01:13:15,669
it's not enough to be told that the
machine

4096
01:13:15,669 --> 01:13:15,679
machine
 

4097
01:13:15,679 --> 01:13:18,790
machine
has a more reliable record um on the

4098
01:13:18,790 --> 01:13:18,800
has a more reliable record um on the
 

4099
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:20,550
has a more reliable record um on the
whole than humans have of making these

4100
01:13:20,550 --> 01:13:20,560
whole than humans have of making these
 

4101
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:22,310
whole than humans have of making these
decisions you

4102
01:13:22,310 --> 01:13:22,320
decisions you
 

4103
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:23,510
decisions you
think you should be given reasons you

4104
01:13:23,510 --> 01:13:23,520
think you should be given reasons you
 

4105
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:25,430
think you should be given reasons you
could understand and and that's why i

4106
01:13:25,430 --> 01:13:25,440
could understand and and that's why i
 

4107
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:26,310
could understand and and that's why i
think

4108
01:13:26,310 --> 01:13:26,320
think
 

4109
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:28,870
think
the present societal trend

4110
01:13:28,870 --> 01:13:28,880
the present societal trend
 

4111
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:30,790
the present societal trend
to um uh

4112
01:13:30,790 --> 01:13:30,800
to um uh
 

4113
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:34,470
to um uh
take away the humans and uh leave us um

4114
01:13:34,470 --> 01:13:34,480
take away the humans and uh leave us um
 

4115
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:37,350
take away the humans and uh leave us um
in the hands of decisions that we can't

4116
01:13:37,350 --> 01:13:37,360
in the hands of decisions that we can't
 

4117
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:40,070
in the hands of decisions that we can't
contest uh is a very dangerous one i

4118
01:13:40,070 --> 01:13:40,080
contest uh is a very dangerous one i
 

4119
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:42,310
contest uh is a very dangerous one i
think we've got to be very careful of

4120
01:13:42,310 --> 01:13:42,320
think we've got to be very careful of
 

4121
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:45,110
think we've got to be very careful of
the extent to which ai which can handle

4122
01:13:45,110 --> 01:13:45,120
the extent to which ai which can handle
 

4123
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:47,030
the extent to which ai which can handle
lots of information actually makes the

4124
01:13:47,030 --> 01:13:47,040
lots of information actually makes the
 

4125
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:49,990
lots of information actually makes the
decisions without oversight and i think

4126
01:13:49,990 --> 01:13:50,000
decisions without oversight and i think
 

4127
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,110
decisions without oversight and i think
we can

4128
01:13:51,110 --> 01:13:51,120
we can
 

4129
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:53,750
we can
use them as a supplement

4130
01:13:53,750 --> 01:13:53,760
use them as a supplement
 

4131
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:56,550
use them as a supplement
but to take the case of um uh

4132
01:13:56,550 --> 01:13:56,560
but to take the case of um uh
 

4133
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:59,189
but to take the case of um uh
radiology and cancer um i mean it's true

4134
01:13:59,189 --> 01:13:59,199
radiology and cancer um i mean it's true
 

4135
01:13:59,199 --> 01:14:00,630
radiology and cancer um i mean it's true
that the

4136
01:14:00,630 --> 01:14:00,640
that the
 

4137
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:01,590
that the
red

4138
01:14:01,590 --> 01:14:01,600
red
 

4139
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:04,390
red
radiologist hasn't seen as many uh uh

4140
01:14:04,390 --> 01:14:04,400
radiologist hasn't seen as many uh uh
 

4141
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:05,830
radiologist hasn't seen as many uh uh
x-rays of

4142
01:14:05,830 --> 01:14:05,840
x-rays of
 

4143
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:08,310
x-rays of
cancer lungs as the machine so the

4144
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:08,320
cancer lungs as the machine so the
 

4145
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:09,669
cancer lungs as the machine so the
machine could certainly help but you

4146
01:14:09,669 --> 01:14:09,679
machine could certainly help but you
 

4147
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:11,510
machine could certainly help but you
want the human to make the final

4148
01:14:11,510 --> 01:14:11,520
want the human to make the final
 

4149
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:13,189
want the human to make the final
decision and i think that's true in most

4150
01:14:13,189 --> 01:14:13,199
decision and i think that's true in most
 

4151
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:16,470
decision and i think that's true in most
of these instances but if we turn a bit

4152
01:14:16,470 --> 01:14:16,480
of these instances but if we turn a bit
 

4153
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:17,990
of these instances but if we turn a bit
to the short-term

4154
01:14:17,990 --> 01:14:18,000
to the short-term
 

4155
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,189
to the short-term
concerns with uh robotics i think the

4156
01:14:21,189 --> 01:14:21,199
concerns with uh robotics i think the
 

4157
01:14:21,199 --> 01:14:23,990
concerns with uh robotics i think the
the big worry of course is the

4158
01:14:23,990 --> 01:14:24,000
the big worry of course is the
 

4159
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,149
the big worry of course is the
effect it has on um people's

4160
01:14:26,149 --> 01:14:26,159
effect it has on um people's
 

4161
01:14:26,159 --> 01:14:28,470
effect it has on um people's
self-respect and their labor market

4162
01:14:28,470 --> 01:14:28,480
self-respect and their labor market
 

4163
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:30,550
self-respect and their labor market
and i think um

4164
01:14:30,550 --> 01:14:30,560
and i think um
 

4165
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:32,070
and i think um
my solution would be

4166
01:14:32,070 --> 01:14:32,080
my solution would be
 

4167
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:34,709
my solution would be
that we should um arrange to tax more

4168
01:14:34,709 --> 01:14:34,719
that we should um arrange to tax more
 

4169
01:14:34,719 --> 01:14:36,070
that we should um arrange to tax more
heavily

4170
01:14:36,070 --> 01:14:36,080
heavily
 

4171
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:37,350
heavily
than big

4172
01:14:37,350 --> 01:14:37,360
than big
 

4173
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:40,229
than big
international conglomerates which uh use

4174
01:14:40,229 --> 01:14:40,239
international conglomerates which uh use
 

4175
01:14:40,239 --> 01:14:42,709
international conglomerates which uh use
the robots um and

4176
01:14:42,709 --> 01:14:42,719
the robots um and
 

4177
01:14:42,719 --> 01:14:44,470
the robots um and
use that tax

4178
01:14:44,470 --> 01:14:44,480
use that tax
 

4179
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:45,590
use that tax
to uh

4180
01:14:45,590 --> 01:14:45,600

of the kind where being a human being is
 

4187
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:54,630
of the kind where being a human being is
important

4195
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:03,510
in public parks and things like that and
if the people who are now

4196
01:15:03,510 --> 01:15:03,520
if the people who are now
 

4197
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:05,750
if the people who are now
working in mind-numbing jobs

working in mind-numbing jobs
 

4199
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:09,270
working in mind-numbing jobs
in amazon warehouses uh or in

01:15:09,270 --> 01:15:09,280
in amazon warehouses uh or in
 

4201
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:12,070
in amazon warehouses uh or in
telephone call centers

4202
01:15:12,070 --> 01:15:12,080
telephone call centers
 

4203
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:15,189
telephone call centers
are automated but those same people

4204
01:15:15,189 --> 01:15:15,199
are automated but those same people
 

4205
01:15:15,199 --> 01:15:16,310
are automated but those same people
are given

4206
01:15:16,310 --> 01:15:16,320
are given
 

4207
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:19,110
are given
jobs where being a human is an asset

4208
01:15:19,110 --> 01:15:19,120
jobs where being a human is an asset
 

4209
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:21,669
jobs where being a human is an asset
um then that's a plus plus situation and

4210
01:15:21,669 --> 01:15:21,679
um then that's a plus plus situation and
 

4211
01:15:21,679 --> 01:15:22,470
um then that's a plus plus situation and
so

4212
01:15:22,470 --> 01:15:22,480
so
 

4213
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:23,430
so
that's

4214
01:15:23,430 --> 01:15:23,440
that's
 

4215
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:25,350
that's
the way i think that we should

4216
01:15:25,350 --> 01:15:25,360
the way i think that we should
 

4217
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:28,870
the way i think that we should
benefit from these these technologies um

4218
01:15:28,870 --> 01:15:28,880
benefit from these these technologies um
 

4219
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:31,110
benefit from these these technologies um
take over the mind-numbing jobs

4220
01:15:31,110 --> 01:15:31,120
take over the mind-numbing jobs
 

4221
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:33,910
take over the mind-numbing jobs
um and uh you use machines to make them

4222
01:15:33,910 --> 01:15:33,920
um and uh you use machines to make them
 

4223
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:35,990
um and uh you use machines to make them
more efficient but um

4224
01:15:35,990 --> 01:15:36,000
more efficient but um
 

4225
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:39,110
more efficient but um
enable um the people

4226
01:15:39,110 --> 01:15:39,120
enable um the people
 

4227
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:41,830
enable um the people
so displaced to do jobs where we do want

4228
01:15:41,830 --> 01:15:41,840
so displaced to do jobs where we do want
 

4229
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:43,270
so displaced to do jobs where we do want
a human being i mean most people when

01:15:43,270 --> 01:15:43,280
a human being i mean most people when
 

4231
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:45,990

the rich people if they have the choice
 

4235
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,750
the rich people if they have the choice
they want human carers and all that

4236
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:49,760
they want human carers and all that
 

4237
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:51,590
they want human carers and all that
don't they they may want have robots to

4238
01:15:51,590 --> 01:15:51,600
don't they they may want have robots to
 

4239
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:53,189
don't they they may want have robots to
help with some things

4240

help with some things
 

4241
01:15:53,199 --> 01:15:54,870
help with some things
empty bed pounds and things like that

4242
01:15:54,870 --> 01:15:54,880
empty bed pounds and things like that
 

4243
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:55,590
empty bed pounds and things like that
but

4244
01:15:55,590 --> 01:15:55,600
but
 

4245
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:59,030
but
but they they want real people and uh

4246
01:15:59,030 --> 01:15:59,040
but they they want real people and uh
 

4247
01:15:59,040 --> 01:15:59,750
but they they want real people and uh
and

4248
01:15:59,750 --> 01:15:59,760
and
 

4249
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:01,270
and
certainly in this country i think even

4250
01:16:01,270 --> 01:16:01,280
certainly in this country i think even
 

4251
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:04,550
certainly in this country i think even
worse in america um the the care of old

4252
01:16:04,550 --> 01:16:04,560
worse in america um the the care of old
 

4253
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:05,590
worse in america um the the care of old
people

4254
01:16:05,590 --> 01:16:05,600
people
 

4255
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:07,669
people
is completely inadequate and it needs us

4256
01:16:07,669 --> 01:16:07,679
is completely inadequate and it needs us
 

4257
01:16:07,679 --> 01:16:10,149
is completely inadequate and it needs us
more human beings to help them cope with

4258
01:16:10,149 --> 01:16:10,159
more human beings to help them cope with
 

4259
01:16:10,159 --> 01:16:11,990
more human beings to help them cope with
everyday life and look after them when

4260
01:16:11,990 --> 01:16:12,000
everyday life and look after them when
 

4261
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,910
everyday life and look after them when
they're sick and um

4262
01:16:13,910 --> 01:16:13,920
they're sick and um
 

4263
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:15,030
they're sick and um
and so

4264
01:16:15,030 --> 01:16:15,040
and so
 

4265
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:16,870
and so
that seems to me the

4266
01:16:16,870 --> 01:16:16,880
that seems to me the
 

4267
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:18,149
that seems to me the
way in which

4268
01:16:18,149 --> 01:16:18,159
way in which
 

4269
01:16:18,159 --> 01:16:19,750
way in which
the money raised in tax on these big

4270
01:16:19,750 --> 01:16:19,760
the money raised in tax on these big
 

4271
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:21,750
the money raised in tax on these big
companies should be deployed so that's

4272
01:16:21,750 --> 01:16:21,760
companies should be deployed so that's
 

4273
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:23,270
companies should be deployed so that's
in the short term but if you actually

4274
01:16:23,270 --> 01:16:23,280
in the short term but if you actually
 

4275
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:26,310
in the short term but if you actually
just look the fact is where we are today

4276
01:16:26,310 --> 01:16:26,320
just look the fact is where we are today
 

4277
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:27,430
just look the fact is where we are today
to

4278
01:16:27,430 --> 01:16:27,440
to
 

4279
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:29,590
to
long-term future in a hundred years it

4280
01:16:29,590 --> 01:16:29,600
long-term future in a hundred years it
 

4281
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:31,510
long-term future in a hundred years it
does seem that

4282
01:16:31,510 --> 01:16:31,520
does seem that
 

4283
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:34,390
does seem that
there is some significant chance

4284
01:16:34,390 --> 01:16:34,400
there is some significant chance
 

4285
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:36,550
there is some significant chance
that the human species is coming to an

4286
01:16:36,550 --> 01:16:36,560
that the human species is coming to an
 

4287
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:37,430
that the human species is coming to an

4288

4289
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:39,189
end
in its

01:16:39,189 --> 01:16:39,199

pure biological form
 

4293
01:16:41,199 --> 01:16:42,709
pure biological form
there's going to be greater and greater

4294
01:16:42,709 --> 01:16:42,719
there's going to be greater and greater
 

4295
01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:45,430
there's going to be greater and greater
integration to genetic modification than

integration to genetic modification than

4300
01:16:49,830 --> 01:16:49,840
cyborg type of creatures and so
 

4301
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:51,110
cyborg type of creatures and so
you have to think all right well we're

4302
01:16:51,110 --> 01:16:51,120
you have to think all right well we're
 

4303
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:53,669
you have to think all right well we're
going to have to get from here to there

4304
01:16:53,669 --> 01:16:53,679
going to have to get from here to there
 

4305
01:16:53,679 --> 01:16:56,149
going to have to get from here to there
and that process is going to be painful

4306
01:16:56,149 --> 01:16:56,159
and that process is going to be painful
 

4307
01:16:56,159 --> 01:16:57,590
and that process is going to be painful
and

4308
01:16:57,590 --> 01:16:57,600
and
 

4309
01:16:57,600 --> 01:16:59,430
and
that you know how there's so many

4310
01:16:59,430 --> 01:16:59,440
that you know how there's so many
 

4311
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:00,790
that you know how there's so many
different trajectories that take us from

01:17:00,790 --> 01:17:00,800
different trajectories that take us from
 

4313
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:02,390
different trajectories that take us from
one place to another

4314
01:17:02,390 --> 01:17:02,400
one place to another
 

4315
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:04,790
one place to another
it does seem that we need to deeply

4316
01:17:04,790 --> 01:17:04,800
it does seem that we need to deeply
 

4317
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:06,070
it does seem that we need to deeply
respect

respect
 

4319
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:08,470

humanness and humanity

humanness and humanity
 

4321
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:10,870
humanness and humanity
basic human rights

4322
01:17:10,870 --> 01:17:10,880
basic human rights
 

4323
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:14,149
basic human rights
human welfare like happiness and

4324
01:17:14,149 --> 01:17:14,159
human welfare like happiness and
 

4325
01:17:14,159 --> 01:17:15,910
human welfare like happiness and
all that kind of no absolutely and

4326
01:17:15,910 --> 01:17:15,920
all that kind of no absolutely and
 

4327
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:17,830
all that kind of no absolutely and
that's why i think we ought to try and

4328
01:17:17,830 --> 01:17:17,840
that's why i think we ought to try and
 

4329
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:20,550
that's why i think we ought to try and
slow down the application of these human

4330
01:17:20,550 --> 01:17:20,560
slow down the application of these human
 

4331
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:22,950
slow down the application of these human
enhancement techniques and cyborg

4332

enhancement techniques and cyborg
 

4333
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:24,790
enhancement techniques and cyborg
techniques for humans for just that

4334
01:17:24,790 --> 01:17:24,800
techniques for humans for just that
 

4335
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:26,550
techniques for humans for just that
reason i mean uh

4336
01:17:26,550 --> 01:17:26,560
reason i mean uh
 

4337
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:28,070
reason i mean uh
that's why i want to lead into the

4338
01:17:28,070 --> 01:17:28,080
that's why i want to lead into the
 

4339
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:30,790
that's why i want to lead into the
people on mars let them do it but but uh

4340
01:17:30,790 --> 01:17:30,800
people on mars let them do it but but uh
 

4341
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:31,669
people on mars let them do it but but uh
but

4342
01:17:31,669 --> 01:17:31,679
but
 

4343
01:17:31,679 --> 01:17:33,590
but
just not reason but they're people too

4344
01:17:33,590 --> 01:17:33,600
just not reason but they're people too
 

4345
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:35,990
just not reason but they're people too
okay people mars are people too yeah i i

4346
01:17:35,990 --> 01:17:36,000
okay people mars are people too yeah i i
 

4347
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,709
okay people mars are people too yeah i i
tend to you know but they are very

4348
01:17:38,709 --> 01:17:38,719
tend to you know but they are very
 

4349
01:17:38,719 --> 01:17:40,950
tend to you know but they are very
poorly adapted to where they are

4350
01:17:40,950 --> 01:17:40,960
poorly adapted to where they are
 

4351
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:42,790
poorly adapted to where they are
right that's why they need spotification

4352
01:17:42,790 --> 01:17:42,800
right that's why they need spotification
 

4353
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:45,430
right that's why they need spotification
whereas we're adapted

4354
01:17:45,430 --> 01:17:45,440
whereas we're adapted
 

4355
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:47,510
whereas we're adapted
to the earth quite well so we don't need

4356
01:17:47,510 --> 01:17:47,520
to the earth quite well so we don't need
 

4357
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:49,669
to the earth quite well so we don't need
these modifications we're we're happy to

4358
01:17:49,669 --> 01:17:49,679
these modifications we're we're happy to
 

4359
01:17:49,679 --> 01:17:51,430
these modifications we're we're happy to
be humans living in

4360
01:17:51,430 --> 01:17:51,440
be humans living in
 

4361
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:53,189
be humans living in
in the environment where our ancestors

4362
01:17:53,189 --> 01:17:53,199
in the environment where our ancestors
 

4363
01:17:53,199 --> 01:17:55,510
in the environment where our ancestors
lived so we don't have the same same

4364
01:17:55,510 --> 01:17:55,520
lived so we don't have the same same
 

4365
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:56,950
lived so we don't have the same same
motive so i think there's a difference

4366
01:17:56,950 --> 01:17:56,960
motive so i think there's a difference
 

4367
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:59,030
motive so i think there's a difference
but i agree with it we don't want uh

4368
01:17:59,030 --> 01:17:59,040
but i agree with it we don't want uh
 

4369
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:01,189
but i agree with it we don't want uh
drastic changes probably in in our

4370
01:18:01,189 --> 01:18:01,199
drastic changes probably in in our
 

4371
01:18:01,199 --> 01:18:03,030
drastic changes probably in in our
lifestyle um and

4372
01:18:03,030 --> 01:18:03,040
lifestyle um and
 

4373
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:04,630
lifestyle um and
that indeed is a worry because some

4374
01:18:04,630 --> 01:18:04,640
that indeed is a worry because some
 

4375
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:06,709
that indeed is a worry because some
things are changing so fast um but i

4376
01:18:06,709 --> 01:18:06,719
things are changing so fast um but i
 

4377
01:18:06,719 --> 01:18:09,030
things are changing so fast um but i
think um i'd like to inject a note of

4378
01:18:09,030 --> 01:18:09,040
think um i'd like to inject a note of
 

4379
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:10,630
think um i'd like to inject a note of
caution um

4380
01:18:10,630 --> 01:18:10,640
caution um
 

4381
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:12,870
caution um
if you think of the way uh progress in

4382
01:18:12,870 --> 01:18:12,880
if you think of the way uh progress in
 

4383
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:16,229
if you think of the way uh progress in
one technology goes um it goes in a sort

4384
01:18:16,229 --> 01:18:16,239
one technology goes um it goes in a sort
 

4385
01:18:16,239 --> 01:18:18,550
one technology goes um it goes in a sort
of spurt it goes up very fast and then

4386
01:18:18,550 --> 01:18:18,560
of spurt it goes up very fast and then
 

4387
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:21,990
of spurt it goes up very fast and then
it levels off um let me give you

4388
01:18:21,990 --> 01:18:22,000
it levels off um let me give you
 

4389
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,830
it levels off um let me give you
two examples well the one we've had

4390
01:18:23,830 --> 01:18:23,840
two examples well the one we've had
 

4391
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:26,550
two examples well the one we've had
already a human space flight

4392
01:18:26,550 --> 01:18:26,560
already a human space flight
 

4393
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:28,630
already a human space flight
at the time of the apollo program which

4394
01:18:28,630 --> 01:18:28,640
at the time of the apollo program which
 

4395
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:31,030
at the time of the apollo program which
was only 12 years after

4396
01:18:31,030 --> 01:18:31,040
was only 12 years after
 

4397
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:34,950
was only 12 years after
sputnik won um i i was alive then and i

4398
01:18:34,950 --> 01:18:34,960
sputnik won um i i was alive then and i
 

4399
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:36,630
sputnik won um i i was alive then and i
thought it would only be 10 or 20 years

4400
01:18:36,630 --> 01:18:36,640
thought it would only be 10 or 20 years
 

4401
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:38,550
thought it would only be 10 or 20 years
further before there were footprints on

4402
01:18:38,550 --> 01:18:38,560
further before there were footprints on
 

4403
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:41,430
further before there were footprints on
mars but as we know for reasons we could

4404
01:18:41,430 --> 01:18:41,440
mars but as we know for reasons we could
 

4405
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:43,510
mars but as we know for reasons we could
all understand um

4406
01:18:43,510 --> 01:18:43,520
all understand um
 

4407
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:45,430
all understand um
that was and still remains the high

4408
01:18:45,430 --> 01:18:45,440
that was and still remains the high
 

4409
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:49,270
that was and still remains the high
point of human space exploration um

4410
01:18:49,270 --> 01:18:49,280
point of human space exploration um
 

4411
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:52,149
point of human space exploration um
that's because it was funded for

4412
01:18:52,149 --> 01:18:52,159
that's because it was funded for
 

4413
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:53,990
that's because it was funded for
reason of superpower rivalry issues

4414
01:18:53,990 --> 01:18:54,000
reason of superpower rivalry issues
 

4415
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,709
reason of superpower rivalry issues
public expense um but uh let me give you

4416
01:18:56,709 --> 01:18:56,719
public expense um but uh let me give you
 

4417
01:18:56,719 --> 01:18:59,110
public expense um but uh let me give you
an another case um

4418
01:18:59,110 --> 01:18:59,120
an another case um
 

4419
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:01,830
an another case um
civil aviation um if you think of the

4420
01:19:01,830 --> 01:19:01,840
civil aviation um if you think of the
 

4421
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:05,270
civil aviation um if you think of the
change between uh 1919 when that was all

4422
01:19:05,270 --> 01:19:05,280
change between uh 1919 when that was all
 

4423
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:06,950
change between uh 1919 when that was all
 and brown's first transatlantic

4424
01:19:06,950 --> 01:19:06,960
and brown's first transatlantic
 

4425
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:10,229
and brown's first transatlantic
fight to 1979 the first flight of the

4426
01:19:10,229 --> 01:19:10,239
fight to 1979 the first flight of the
 

4427
01:19:10,239 --> 01:19:13,030
fight to 1979 the first flight of the
jumbo jet was a big change

4428
01:19:13,030 --> 01:19:13,040
jumbo jet was a big change
 

4429
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:15,669
jumbo jet was a big change
but it's more than 50 years since 1969

4430
01:19:15,669 --> 01:19:15,679
but it's more than 50 years since 1969
 

4431
01:19:15,679 --> 01:19:17,030
but it's more than 50 years since 1969
and we still have jumbo just more or

4432
01:19:17,030 --> 01:19:17,040
and we still have jumbo just more or
 

4433
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:18,470
and we still have jumbo just more or
less the same so that's an example of

4434
01:19:18,470 --> 01:19:18,480
less the same so that's an example of
 

4435
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:20,550
less the same so that's an example of
something which developed fast and

4436
01:19:20,550 --> 01:19:20,560
something which developed fast and
 

4437
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:23,030
something which developed fast and
change ever and to take another analogy

4438
01:19:23,030 --> 01:19:23,040
change ever and to take another analogy
 

4439
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:26,630
change ever and to take another analogy
um we've had huge developments in uh

4440
01:19:26,630 --> 01:19:26,640
um we've had huge developments in uh
 

4441
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:29,110
um we've had huge developments in uh
mobile phones but uh i suspect the

4442
01:19:29,110 --> 01:19:29,120
mobile phones but uh i suspect the
 

4443
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:31,510
mobile phones but uh i suspect the
iphone the iphone 24 may not be too

4444
01:19:31,510 --> 01:19:31,520
iphone the iphone 24 may not be too
 

4445
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:33,669
iphone the iphone 24 may not be too
different from the iphone 13.

4446
01:19:33,669 --> 01:19:33,679
different from the iphone 13.
 

4447
01:19:33,679 --> 01:19:35,669
different from the iphone 13.
um because you know

4448
01:19:35,669 --> 01:19:35,679
um because you know
 

4449
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:36,390
um because you know
they

4450
01:19:36,390 --> 01:19:36,400
they
 

4451
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:38,310
they
develop but then

4452
01:19:38,310 --> 01:19:38,320
develop but then
 

4453
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:40,390
develop but then
they saturate and then maybe some new

4454
01:19:40,390 --> 01:19:40,400
they saturate and then maybe some new
 

4455
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:42,550
they saturate and then maybe some new
innovation takes over in stimulating

4456
01:19:42,550 --> 01:19:42,560
innovation takes over in stimulating
 

4457
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:44,229
innovation takes over in stimulating
economic growth

4458
01:19:44,229 --> 01:19:44,239
economic growth
 

4459
01:19:44,239 --> 01:19:46,229
economic growth
yeah so it's that

4460
01:19:46,229 --> 01:19:46,239
yeah so it's that
 

4461
01:19:46,239 --> 01:19:48,310
yeah so it's that
we have to be cautious about being too

4462
01:19:48,310 --> 01:19:48,320
we have to be cautious about being too
 

4463
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:49,750
we have to be cautious about being too
optimistic

4464
01:19:49,750 --> 01:19:49,760
optimistic
 

4465
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:51,669
optimistic
and we have to be cautious about being

4466
01:19:51,669 --> 01:19:51,679
and we have to be cautious about being
 

4467
01:19:51,679 --> 01:19:54,950
and we have to be cautious about being
too cynical i think that is well

4468
01:19:54,950 --> 01:19:54,960
too cynical i think that is well
 

4469
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:56,550
too cynical i think that is well
optimistic is begging the question i

4470
01:19:56,550 --> 01:19:56,560
optimistic is begging the question i
 

4471
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:59,189
optimistic is begging the question i
mean do we want this very rapid change

4472
01:19:59,189 --> 01:19:59,199
mean do we want this very rapid change
 

4473
01:19:59,199 --> 01:20:00,870
mean do we want this very rapid change
right so first of all there's some

4474
01:20:00,870 --> 01:20:00,880
right so first of all there's some
 

4475
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:02,790
right so first of all there's some
degree to which technological

4476
01:20:02,790 --> 01:20:02,800
degree to which technological
 

4477
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:05,189
degree to which technological
advancement is is something is a force

4478
01:20:05,189 --> 01:20:05,199
advancement is is something is a force
 

4479
01:20:05,199 --> 01:20:07,350
advancement is is something is a force
that can't be stopped and so the

4480
01:20:07,350 --> 01:20:07,360
that can't be stopped and so the
 

4481
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:09,430
that can't be stopped and so the
question is about directing it versus

4482
01:20:09,430 --> 01:20:09,440
question is about directing it versus
 

4483
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:11,110
question is about directing it versus
stopping it

4484
01:20:11,110 --> 01:20:11,120
stopping it
 

4485
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:12,390
stopping it
can be sort of

4486
01:20:12,390 --> 01:20:12,400
can be sort of
 

4487
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:14,310
can be sort of
slow we'll take human space flight there

4488
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:14,320
slow we'll take human space flight there
 

4489
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:15,910
slow we'll take human space flight there
could be have been

4490
01:20:15,910 --> 01:20:15,920
could be have been
 

4491
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:18,390
could be have been
footprints on mars if um if america had

4492
01:20:18,390 --> 01:20:18,400
footprints on mars if um if america had
 

4493
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:19,750
footprints on mars if um if america had
gone on spending four percent of the

4494
01:20:19,750 --> 01:20:19,760
gone on spending four percent of the
 

4495
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:21,110
gone on spending four percent of the
federal budget

4496
01:20:21,110 --> 01:20:21,120

01:20:22,950 --> 01:20:22,960
on the project after
 

4499
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:24,629
on the project after
yes upon uh

4500
01:20:24,629 --> 01:20:24,639
yes upon uh
 

4501
01:20:24,639 --> 01:20:26,390
yes upon uh
the reason

4502
01:20:26,390 --> 01:20:26,400
the reason
 

4503
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:29,189
the reason
there were very good reasons but um

4504
01:20:29,189 --> 01:20:29,199
there were very good reasons but um
 

4505
01:20:29,199 --> 01:20:30,470
there were very good reasons but um
and we could we could have had

4506
01:20:30,470 --> 01:20:30,480
and we could we could have had
 

4507
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:32,950
and we could we could have had
supersonic flight but concorde came and

4508
01:20:32,950 --> 01:20:32,960
supersonic flight but concorde came and
 

4509
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:35,510
supersonic flight but concorde came and
went during the 50 years

4510
01:20:35,510 --> 01:20:35,520
went during the 50 years
 

4511
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:36,790
went during the 50 years
but the reason

4512
01:20:36,790 --> 01:20:36,800
but the reason
 

4513
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:39,590
but the reason
it didn't progress it's not because

4514
01:20:39,590 --> 01:20:39,600
it didn't progress it's not because
 

4515
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:41,189
it didn't progress it's not because
we realize it's not good for human

4516
01:20:41,189 --> 01:20:41,199
we realize it's not good for human
 

4517
01:20:41,199 --> 01:20:43,430
we realize it's not good for human
society the reason it didn't progress is

4518
01:20:43,430 --> 01:20:43,440
society the reason it didn't progress is
 

4519
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:47,270
society the reason it didn't progress is
because it could make uh

4520
01:20:47,270 --> 01:20:47,280
because it could make uh
 

4521
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:49,030
because it could make uh
sort of from a capitalist perspective it

4522
01:20:49,030 --> 01:20:49,040
sort of from a capitalist perspective it
 

4523
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:50,310
sort of from a capitalist perspective it
couldn't make

4524
01:20:50,310 --> 01:20:50,320
couldn't make
 

4525
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:52,470
couldn't make
uh there there was no short-term or

4526
01:20:52,470 --> 01:20:52,480
uh there there was no short-term or
 

4527
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:54,550
uh there there was no short-term or
long-term way for it to make money so

4528
01:20:54,550 --> 01:20:54,560
long-term way for it to make money so
 

4529
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:55,990
long-term way for it to make money so
for me

4530
01:20:55,990 --> 01:20:56,000
for me
 

4531
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,189
for me
but that's the same as saying it's not

4532
01:20:57,189 --> 01:20:57,199
but that's the same as saying it's not
 

4533
01:20:57,199 --> 01:20:59,510
but that's the same as saying it's not
good for society

4534
01:20:59,510 --> 01:20:59,520
good for society
 

4535
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:01,350
good for society
i don't think

4536
01:21:01,350 --> 01:21:01,360
i don't think
 

4537
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:03,030
i don't think
everything that makes money is good for

4538
01:21:03,030 --> 01:21:03,040
everything that makes money is good for
 

4539
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:04,950
everything that makes money is good for
society and everything that doesn't make

4540
01:21:04,950 --> 01:21:04,960
society and everything that doesn't make
 

4541
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:07,270
society and everything that doesn't make
money is bad for society right that's a

4542
01:21:07,270 --> 01:21:07,280
money is bad for society right that's a
 

4543
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:09,910
money is bad for society right that's a
that's a difficult

4544
01:21:09,910 --> 01:21:09,920
that's a difficult
 

4545
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:11,189
that's a difficult
that's a difficult thing we're always

4546
01:21:11,189 --> 01:21:11,199
that's a difficult thing we're always
 

4547
01:21:11,199 --> 01:21:12,870
that's a difficult thing we're always
contending with when we look at social

4548
01:21:12,870 --> 01:21:12,880
contending with when we look at social
 

4549
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:15,669
contending with when we look at social
networks it's not obvious even though

4550
01:21:15,669 --> 01:21:15,679
networks it's not obvious even though
 

4551
01:21:15,679 --> 01:21:17,270
networks it's not obvious even though
they make a tremendous amount of money

4552
01:21:17,270 --> 01:21:17,280
they make a tremendous amount of money
 

4553
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:19,510
they make a tremendous amount of money
that they're good for society especially

4554
01:21:19,510 --> 01:21:19,520
that they're good for society especially
 

4555
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:21,110
that they're good for society especially
how they're currently implemented with

4556
01:21:21,110 --> 01:21:21,120
how they're currently implemented with
 

4557
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:22,629
how they're currently implemented with
advertisement and engagement

4558
01:21:22,629 --> 01:21:22,639
advertisement and engagement
 

4559
01:21:22,639 --> 01:21:24,149
advertisement and engagement
maximization

4560
01:21:24,149 --> 01:21:24,159
maximization
 

4561
01:21:24,159 --> 01:21:27,189
maximization
so that's the constant struggle

4562
01:21:27,189 --> 01:21:27,199
so that's the constant struggle
 

4563
01:21:27,199 --> 01:21:29,189
so that's the constant struggle
you know i agree with you as many

4564
01:21:29,189 --> 01:21:29,199
you know i agree with you as many
 

4565
01:21:29,199 --> 01:21:31,510
you know i agree with you as many
innovations are damaging yes yeah

4566
01:21:31,510 --> 01:21:31,520
innovations are damaging yes yeah
 

4567
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:33,590
innovations are damaging yes yeah
yes uh well

4568
01:21:33,590 --> 01:21:33,600
yes uh well
 

4569
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:35,189
yes uh well
but i would have thought that supersonic

4570
01:21:35,189 --> 01:21:35,199
but i would have thought that supersonic
 

4571
01:21:35,199 --> 01:21:36,310
but i would have thought that supersonic
flight was

4572
01:21:36,310 --> 01:21:36,320
flight was
 

4573
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:38,310
flight was
uh something that would benefit only a

4574
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:38,320
uh something that would benefit only a
 

4575
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:41,350
uh something that would benefit only a
tiny elite sure huge expense and

4576
01:21:41,350 --> 01:21:41,360
tiny elite sure huge expense and
 

4577
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:43,590
tiny elite sure huge expense and
environmental damage that was obviously

4578
01:21:43,590 --> 01:21:43,600
environmental damage that was obviously
 

4579
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:45,030
environmental damage that was obviously
something which they're very glad not to

4580
01:21:45,030 --> 01:21:45,040
something which they're very glad not to
 

4581
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:46,709
something which they're very glad not to
have in my opinion

4582
01:21:46,709 --> 01:21:46,719
have in my opinion
 

4583
01:21:46,719 --> 01:21:47,590
have in my opinion
yeah

4584
01:21:47,590 --> 01:21:47,600
yeah
 

4585
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:49,669
yeah
but perhaps there was a way to do it

4586
01:21:49,669 --> 01:21:49,679
but perhaps there was a way to do it
 

4587
01:21:49,679 --> 01:21:51,110
but perhaps there was a way to do it
where it could benefit the general

4588
01:21:51,110 --> 01:21:51,120
where it could benefit the general
 

4589
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:52,790
where it could benefit the general
populace if you were to think about

4590
01:21:52,790 --> 01:21:52,800
populace if you were to think about
 

4591
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:54,950
populace if you were to think about
airplanes wouldn't you think that in the

4592
01:21:54,950 --> 01:21:54,960
airplanes wouldn't you think that in the
 

4593
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:57,110
airplanes wouldn't you think that in the
early days airplanes would have been

4594
01:21:57,110 --> 01:21:57,120
early days airplanes would have been
 

4595
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:59,510
early days airplanes would have been
seen as something that can surely only

4596
01:21:59,510 --> 01:21:59,520
seen as something that can surely only
 

4597
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:00,709
seen as something that can surely only
benefit

4598
01:22:00,709 --> 01:22:00,719
benefit
 

4599
01:22:00,719 --> 01:22:03,750
benefit
one percent at most of the population as

4600
01:22:03,750 --> 01:22:03,760
one percent at most of the population as
 

4601
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:06,390
one percent at most of the population as
opposed to a much larger percentage

4602
01:22:06,390 --> 01:22:06,400
opposed to a much larger percentage
 

4603
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:08,310
opposed to a much larger percentage
there's there's another aspect of

4604
01:22:08,310 --> 01:22:08,320
there's there's another aspect of
 

4605
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:09,910
there's there's another aspect of
capital a system that's able to drive

4606
01:22:09,910 --> 01:22:09,920
capital a system that's able to drive
 

4607
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:11,750
capital a system that's able to drive
down cost once you get the thing kind of

4608
01:22:11,750 --> 01:22:11,760
down cost once you get the thing kind of
 

4609
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:14,790
down cost once you get the thing kind of
going so the you know we get together

4610
01:22:14,790 --> 01:22:14,800
going so the you know we get together
 

4611
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:16,629
going so the you know we get together
maybe with taxpayer money and get the

4612
01:22:16,629 --> 01:22:16,639
maybe with taxpayer money and get the
 

4613
01:22:16,639 --> 01:22:18,950
maybe with taxpayer money and get the
thing going at first and once it gets

4614
01:22:18,950 --> 01:22:18,960
thing going at first and once it gets
 

4615
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:21,189
thing going at first and once it gets
going companies step up and drive down

4616
01:22:21,189 --> 01:22:21,199
going companies step up and drive down
 

4617
01:22:21,199 --> 01:22:23,910
going companies step up and drive down
the cost and actually make it so that

4618
01:22:23,910 --> 01:22:23,920
the cost and actually make it so that
 

4619
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:25,750
the cost and actually make it so that
blue collar folks can actually start

4620
01:22:25,750 --> 01:22:25,760
blue collar folks can actually start
 

4621
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:27,590
blue collar folks can actually start
using the stuff yeah sometimes that does

4622
01:22:27,590 --> 01:22:27,600
using the stuff yeah sometimes that does
 

4623
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:29,350
using the stuff yeah sometimes that does
happen that's good

4624
01:22:29,350 --> 01:22:29,360
happen that's good
 

4625
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:32,070
happen that's good
yeah so it's that's again the the

4626
01:22:32,070 --> 01:22:32,080
yeah so it's that's again the the
 

4627
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:34,629
yeah so it's that's again the the
double-edged sword of human civilization

4628
01:22:34,629 --> 01:22:34,639
double-edged sword of human civilization
 

4629
01:22:34,639 --> 01:22:35,830
double-edged sword of human civilization
that

4630
01:22:35,830 --> 01:22:35,840
that
 

4631
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:38,790
that
some technology hurts us some benefits

4632
01:22:38,790 --> 01:22:38,800
some technology hurts us some benefits
 

4633
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:40,709
some technology hurts us some benefits
us and we don't know ahead of time we

4634
01:22:40,709 --> 01:22:40,719
us and we don't know ahead of time we
 

4635
01:22:40,719 --> 01:22:42,550
us and we don't know ahead of time we
can just do our best and

4636
01:22:42,550 --> 01:22:42,560
can just do our best and
 

4637
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:44,310
can just do our best and
there's a gap between what could be done

4638
01:22:44,310 --> 01:22:44,320
there's a gap between what could be done
 

4639
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:46,310
there's a gap between what could be done
and what

4640
01:22:46,310 --> 01:22:46,320
and what
 

4641
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:49,110
and what
we can actually decide to do

4642
01:22:49,110 --> 01:22:49,120
we can actually decide to do
 

4643
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:51,430
we can actually decide to do
yes in the term you could push forward

4644
01:22:51,430 --> 01:22:51,440
yes in the term you could push forward
 

4645
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:53,590
yes in the term you could push forward
some developments um

4646
01:22:53,590 --> 01:22:53,600
some developments um
 

4647
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:57,110
some developments um
faster than we do let me ask you

4648
01:22:57,110 --> 01:22:57,120
faster than we do let me ask you
 

4649
01:22:57,120 --> 01:22:59,110
faster than we do let me ask you
in your book on the future prospects for

4650
01:22:59,110 --> 01:22:59,120
in your book on the future prospects for
 

4651
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:01,270
in your book on the future prospects for
humanity

4652
01:23:01,270 --> 01:23:01,280
humanity
 

4653
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:03,110
humanity
you imagine a time machine that allows

4654
01:23:03,110 --> 01:23:03,120
you imagine a time machine that allows
 

4655
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:04,870
you imagine a time machine that allows
you to send a tweet-length message to

4656
01:23:04,870 --> 01:23:04,880
you to send a tweet-length message to
 

4657
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:07,030
you to send a tweet-length message to
scientists in the past like to newton

4658
01:23:07,030 --> 01:23:07,040
scientists in the past like to newton
 

4659
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:10,550
scientists in the past like to newton
yes um what tweet would you send

4660
01:23:10,550 --> 01:23:10,560
yes um what tweet would you send
 

4661
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:12,149
yes um what tweet would you send
it's an interesting thought experiment

4662
01:23:12,149 --> 01:23:12,159
it's an interesting thought experiment
 

4663
01:23:12,159 --> 01:23:14,390
it's an interesting thought experiment
what message would you send to newton

4664
01:23:14,390 --> 01:23:14,400
what message would you send to newton
 

4665
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:16,390
what message would you send to newton
about what we know today

4666
01:23:16,390 --> 01:23:16,400
about what we know today
 

4667
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:17,830
about what we know today
well i think he'd love to know that

4668
01:23:17,830 --> 01:23:17,840
well i think he'd love to know that
 

4669
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:20,790
well i think he'd love to know that
there were planets around other stars um

4670
01:23:20,790 --> 01:23:20,800
there were planets around other stars um
 

4671
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:23,189
there were planets around other stars um
he'd like to know that that would really

4672
01:23:23,189 --> 01:23:23,199
he'd like to know that that would really
 

4673
01:23:23,199 --> 01:23:24,470
he'd like to know that that would really
blow his mind he'd like to know that

4674
01:23:24,470 --> 01:23:24,480
blow his mind he'd like to know that
 

4675
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:26,310
blow his mind he'd like to know that
everything was made of atoms

4676
01:23:26,310 --> 01:23:26,320
everything was made of atoms
 

4677
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:28,149
everything was made of atoms
uh he'd like to know that if he looked a

4678
01:23:28,149 --> 01:23:28,159
uh he'd like to know that if he looked a
 

4679
01:23:28,159 --> 01:23:32,310
uh he'd like to know that if he looked a
bit more carefully through his prisms

4680
01:23:32,310 --> 01:23:32,320
bit more carefully through his prisms
 

4681
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:33,110
bit more carefully through his prisms
and

4682
01:23:33,110 --> 01:23:33,120
and
 

4683
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:34,709
and
looked at light not just from the sun

4684
01:23:34,709 --> 01:23:34,719
looked at light not just from the sun
 

4685
01:23:34,719 --> 01:23:37,030
looked at light not just from the sun
but from

4686
01:23:37,030 --> 01:23:37,040
but from
 

4687
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:39,669
but from
from some flames he might get the idea

4688
01:23:39,669 --> 01:23:39,679
from some flames he might get the idea
 

4689
01:23:39,679 --> 01:23:41,830
from some flames he might get the idea
that uh different substances emitted

4690
01:23:41,830 --> 01:23:41,840
that uh different substances emitted
 

4691
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:43,910
that uh different substances emitted
light of different different colors and

4692
01:23:43,910 --> 01:23:43,920
light of different different colors and
 

4693
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:44,950
light of different different colors and
he might have

4694
01:23:44,950 --> 01:23:44,960
he might have
 

4695
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:45,830
he might have
been

4696
01:23:45,830 --> 01:23:45,840
been
 

4697
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:48,790
been
twigged to discover some things that had

4698
01:23:48,790 --> 01:23:48,800
twigged to discover some things that had
 

4699
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:51,270
twigged to discover some things that had
to wait two or three hundred years

4700
01:23:51,270 --> 01:23:51,280
to wait two or three hundred years
 

4701
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:53,910
to wait two or three hundred years
could have given him those clues i think

4702
01:23:53,910 --> 01:23:53,920
could have given him those clues i think
 

4703
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:55,910
could have given him those clues i think
it's kind of it's fascinating to think

4704
01:23:55,910 --> 01:23:55,920
it's kind of it's fascinating to think
 

4705
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:59,430
it's kind of it's fascinating to think
to look back at how little

4706
01:23:59,430 --> 01:23:59,440
to look back at how little
 

4707
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:00,790
to look back at how little
he understood

4708
01:24:00,790 --> 01:24:00,800
he understood
 

4709
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:02,790
he understood
people at that time understood about our

4710
01:24:02,790 --> 01:24:02,800
people at that time understood about our
 

4711
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:04,790
people at that time understood about our
world

4712
01:24:04,790 --> 01:24:04,800
world
 

4713
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:06,149
world
yes

4714
01:24:06,149 --> 01:24:06,159
yes
 

4715
01:24:06,159 --> 01:24:07,590
yes
and certainly about the cosmos because

4716
01:24:07,590 --> 01:24:07,600
and certainly about the cosmos because
 

4717
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:08,870
and certainly about the cosmos because
of both

4718
01:24:08,870 --> 01:24:08,880
of both
 

4719
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:11,430
of both
well if you think about astronomy um

4720
01:24:11,430 --> 01:24:11,440
well if you think about astronomy um
 

4721
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:14,830
well if you think about astronomy um
then until about 1850

4722
01:24:14,830 --> 01:24:14,840
then until about 1850
 

4723
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:19,189
then until about 1850

would he be able to make sense of

4804
01:25:40,070 --> 01:25:40,080
would he be able to make sense of
 

4805
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:42,229
would he be able to make sense of
space-time and the curvature of

4806
01:25:42,229 --> 01:25:42,239
space-time and the curvature of
 

4807
01:25:42,239 --> 01:25:45,189
space-time and the curvature of
space-time and well i think

4808
01:25:45,189 --> 01:25:45,199
space-time and well i think
 

4809
01:25:45,199 --> 01:25:47,030
space-time and well i think
given a quick course i mean he was sort

4810
01:25:47,030 --> 01:25:47,040
given a quick course i mean he was sort
 

4811
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:50,149
given a quick course i mean he was sort
of uh if it looks back he he was really

4812
01:25:50,149 --> 01:25:50,159
of uh if it looks back he he was really
 

4813
01:25:50,159 --> 01:25:52,870
of uh if it looks back he he was really
a unique intellect in a way you know and

4814
01:25:52,870 --> 01:25:52,880
a unique intellect in a way you know and
 

4815
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:54,390
a unique intellect in a way you know and
uh

4816
01:25:54,390 --> 01:25:54,400
uh
 

4817
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:56,229
uh
he said that he

4818
01:25:56,229 --> 01:25:56,239
he said that he
 

4819
01:25:56,239 --> 01:25:58,149
he said that he
thought better than everything everyone

4820
01:25:58,149 --> 01:25:58,159
thought better than everything everyone
 

4821
01:25:58,159 --> 01:26:00,629
thought better than everything everyone
else by thinking on things continually

4822
01:26:00,629 --> 01:26:00,639
else by thinking on things continually
 

4823
01:26:00,639 --> 01:26:03,030
else by thinking on things continually
and thinking very deep thoughts and um

4824
01:26:03,030 --> 01:26:03,040
and thinking very deep thoughts and um
 

4825
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:05,669
and thinking very deep thoughts and um
so he was a utterly remarkable intellect

4826
01:26:05,669 --> 01:26:05,679
so he was a utterly remarkable intellect
 

4827
01:26:05,679 --> 01:26:07,510
so he was a utterly remarkable intellect
obviously but of course scientists

aren't all like that i think it's the

4830
01:26:09,350 --> 01:26:09,360
aren't all like that i think it's the
 

4831
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:10,790
aren't all like that i think it's the
one thing that interests me having spent

4832
01:26:10,790 --> 01:26:10,800
one thing that interests me having spent
 

4833

one thing that interests me having spent
a life among scientists is what a

4834
01:26:12,709 --> 01:26:12,719
a life among scientists is what a
 

4835
01:26:12,719 --> 01:26:16,070
a life among scientists is what a
variety of uh mindsets and mental styles

4836
01:26:16,070 --> 01:26:16,080
variety of uh mindsets and mental styles
 

4837
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:19,430
variety of uh mindsets and mental styles
they have yes um and um um

4838
01:26:19,430 --> 01:26:19,440
they have yes um and um um
 

4839
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:20,149
they have yes um and um um
well

4840
01:26:20,149 --> 01:26:20,159
well

just to contrast newton and darwin um

4842
01:26:24,790 --> 01:26:24,800
just to contrast newton and darwin um
 

4843
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:28,229
just to contrast newton and darwin um
darwin uh uh said uh uh and he felt

4844
01:26:28,229 --> 01:26:28,239
darwin uh uh said uh uh and he felt
 

4845
01:26:28,239 --> 01:26:29,750
darwin uh uh said uh uh and he felt
correct as he

4846
01:26:29,750 --> 01:26:29,760
correct as he
 

4847
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:32,709
correct as he
that he thought he just had a um as much

4848
01:26:32,709 --> 01:26:32,719
that he thought he just had a um as much
 

4849
01:26:32,719 --> 01:26:33,830
that he thought he just had a um as much
sort of a

4850
01:26:33,830 --> 01:26:33,840
sort of a
 

4851
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:35,669
sort of a
common sense and reasoning power is the

4852
01:26:35,669 --> 01:26:35,679
common sense and reasoning power is the
 

4853
01:26:35,679 --> 01:26:37,910
common sense and reasoning power is the

average lawyer
 

4855
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:39,750
average lawyer
and that's probably true because his

4856
01:26:39,750 --> 01:26:39,760
and that's probably true because his
 

4857
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:42,229
and that's probably true because his
ability was to sort of uh collect data

ability was to sort of uh collect data
 

4859
01:26:42,239 --> 01:26:44,790
ability was to sort of uh collect data
and think through things deeply um

4860
01:26:44,790 --> 01:26:44,800
and think through things deeply um
 

4861
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:46,149
and think through things deeply um
that's a quite different kind of

01:27:13,199 --> 01:27:15,830
have emerged from obviously i agree it's
an amazing story that uh um

4886
01:27:15,830 --> 01:27:15,840
an amazing story that uh um
 

4887
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:17,510
an amazing story that uh um
well of course

4888
01:27:17,510 --> 01:27:17,520
well of course
 

4889
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:19,110
well of course
what's interesting is einstein's

4890
01:27:19,110 --> 01:27:19,120
what's interesting is einstein's
 

4891
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:21,750
what's interesting is einstein's
reaction because of course although as

4892
01:27:21,750 --> 01:27:21,760
reaction because of course although as
 

4893
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:23,510
reaction because of course although as
you know we now accept this as one of

4894
01:27:23,510 --> 01:27:23,520
you know we now accept this as one of
 

4895
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:24,870
you know we now accept this as one of
the most remarkable predictions of

4896
01:27:24,870 --> 01:27:24,880
the most remarkable predictions of
 

4897
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:27,590
the most remarkable predictions of
einstein's theory uh he never took it

4898
01:27:27,590 --> 01:27:27,600
einstein's theory uh he never took it
 

4899
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:30,310
einstein's theory uh he never took it
seriously even believed it um although

4900
01:27:30,310 --> 01:27:30,320
seriously even believed it um although
 

4901
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:33,189
seriously even believed it um although
it was a consequence of uh

4902
01:27:33,189 --> 01:27:33,199
it was a consequence of uh
 

4903
01:27:33,199 --> 01:27:35,189
it was a consequence of uh
seuss of his equations which someone

4904
01:27:35,189 --> 01:27:35,199
seuss of his equations which someone
 

4905
01:27:35,199 --> 01:27:36,390
seuss of his equations which someone
discovered

4906
01:27:36,390 --> 01:27:36,400
discovered
 

4907
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:37,510
discovered
just a year after his theory

4908
01:27:37,510 --> 01:27:37,520
just a year after his theory
 

4909
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:40,550
just a year after his theory
schwarzschild um but he never took it

4910
01:27:40,550 --> 01:27:40,560
schwarzschild um but he never took it
 

4911
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:42,950
schwarzschild um but he never took it
seriously and others did but then of

4912
01:27:42,950 --> 01:27:42,960
seriously and others did but then of
 

4913
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:45,189
seriously and others did but then of
course

4914
01:27:45,189 --> 01:27:45,199
course
 

4915
01:27:45,199 --> 01:27:47,189
course
well this is something that i've been

4916
01:27:47,189 --> 01:27:47,199
well this is something that i've been
 

4917
01:27:47,199 --> 01:27:48,550
well this is something that i've been
involved in actually finding evidence

4918
01:27:48,550 --> 01:27:48,560
involved in actually finding evidence
 

4919
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:50,550
involved in actually finding evidence
for black holes and that's coming last

4920
01:27:50,550 --> 01:27:50,560
for black holes and that's coming last
 

4921
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:52,550
for black holes and that's coming last
50 years and um

4922
01:27:52,550 --> 01:27:52,560
50 years and um
 

4923
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:54,070
50 years and um
so now there's pretty compelling

4924
01:27:54,070 --> 01:27:54,080
so now there's pretty compelling
 

4925
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:55,830
so now there's pretty compelling
evidence that they exist

4926
01:27:55,830 --> 01:27:55,840
evidence that they exist
 

4927
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:58,709
evidence that they exist
um as the remnants of stars or big ones

4928
01:27:58,709 --> 01:27:58,719
um as the remnants of stars or big ones
 

4929
01:27:58,719 --> 01:28:01,110
um as the remnants of stars or big ones
in the centers of galaxies and beyond we

4930
01:28:01,110 --> 01:28:01,120
in the centers of galaxies and beyond we
 

4931
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:03,030
in the centers of galaxies and beyond we
understand uh

4932
01:28:03,030 --> 01:28:03,040
understand uh
 

4933
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:05,590
understand uh
what's the what's going on we have ideas

4934
01:28:05,590 --> 01:28:05,600
what's the what's going on we have ideas
 

4935
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:07,830
what's the what's going on we have ideas
vaguely how they form

4936
01:28:07,830 --> 01:28:07,840
vaguely how they form
 

4937
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:09,510
vaguely how they form
and of course uh

4938
01:28:09,510 --> 01:28:09,520
and of course uh
 

4939
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:12,390
and of course uh
gravitational waves have been detected

4940
01:28:12,390 --> 01:28:12,400
gravitational waves have been detected
 

4941
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:13,590
gravitational waves have been detected
and that's an amazing piece of

4942
01:28:13,590 --> 01:28:13,600
and that's an amazing piece of
 

4943
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:15,669
and that's an amazing piece of
technology ligo is one of the most

4944
01:28:15,669 --> 01:28:15,679
technology ligo is one of the most
 

4945
01:28:15,679 --> 01:28:17,910
technology ligo is one of the most
incredible engineering efforts of all

4946
01:28:17,910 --> 01:28:17,920
incredible engineering efforts of all
 

4947
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:19,270
incredible engineering efforts of all
time that's an example where the

4948
01:28:19,270 --> 01:28:19,280
time that's an example where the
 

4949
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:21,990
time that's an example where the
engineers deserve the most of the credit

4950
01:28:21,990 --> 01:28:22,000
engineers deserve the most of the credit
 

4951
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:23,990
engineers deserve the most of the credit
because the precision is well as they

4952
01:28:23,990 --> 01:28:24,000
because the precision is well as they
 

4953
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:25,350
because the precision is well as they
said it's like

4954
01:28:25,350 --> 01:28:25,360
said it's like
 

4955
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:27,510
said it's like
measuring the thickness of a hair at the

4956
01:28:27,510 --> 01:28:27,520
measuring the thickness of a hair at the
 

4957
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:29,669
measuring the thickness of a hair at the
distance of alpha centauri yeah it's

4958
01:28:29,669 --> 01:28:29,679
distance of alpha centauri yeah it's
 

4959
01:28:29,679 --> 01:28:31,910
distance of alpha centauri yeah it's
incredible 10 to the minus 21. so maybe

4960
01:28:31,910 --> 01:28:31,920
incredible 10 to the minus 21. so maybe
 

4961
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:33,669
incredible 10 to the minus 21. so maybe
actually if we step back what are black

4962
01:28:33,669 --> 01:28:33,679
actually if we step back what are black
 

4963
01:28:33,679 --> 01:28:36,310
actually if we step back what are black
holes what do we humans understand about

4964
01:28:36,310 --> 01:28:36,320
holes what do we humans understand about
 

4965
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:39,030
holes what do we humans understand about
black holes and what's still

4966
01:28:39,030 --> 01:28:39,040
black holes and what's still
 

4967
01:28:39,040 --> 01:28:42,470
black holes and what's still
unknown einstein's theory extended by

4968
01:28:42,470 --> 01:28:42,480
unknown einstein's theory extended by
 

4969
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:45,110
unknown einstein's theory extended by
people like roger penrose tells us that

4970
01:28:45,110 --> 01:28:45,120
people like roger penrose tells us that
 

4971
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:47,910
people like roger penrose tells us that
um black holes are in a sense rather

4972
01:28:47,910 --> 01:28:47,920
um black holes are in a sense rather
 

4973
01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:52,390
um black holes are in a sense rather
simple things basically because they are

4974
01:28:52,390 --> 01:28:52,400
simple things basically because they are
 

4975
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:54,870
simple things basically because they are
solutions of einstein's equations

4976
01:28:54,870 --> 01:28:54,880
solutions of einstein's equations
 

4977
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:56,390
solutions of einstein's equations
and the thing that was shown in the

4978
01:28:56,390 --> 01:28:56,400
and the thing that was shown in the
 

4979
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:59,830
and the thing that was shown in the
1960s by roger penrose in particular

4980
01:28:59,830 --> 01:28:59,840
1960s by roger penrose in particular
 

4981
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:03,510
1960s by roger penrose in particular
um and by a few other people was that um

4982
01:29:03,510 --> 01:29:03,520
um and by a few other people was that um
 

4983
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:05,590
um and by a few other people was that um
a black hole when it forms and settles

4984
01:29:05,590 --> 01:29:05,600
a black hole when it forms and settles
 

4985
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:06,629
a black hole when it forms and settles
down

4986
01:29:06,629 --> 01:29:06,639
down
 

4987
01:29:06,639 --> 01:29:09,189
down
is defined just by two quantities it's

4988
01:29:09,189 --> 01:29:09,199
is defined just by two quantities it's
 

4989
01:29:09,199 --> 01:29:10,950
is defined just by two quantities it's
mass and it's spin

4990
01:29:10,950 --> 01:29:10,960
mass and it's spin
 

4991
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:12,229
mass and it's spin
so they're actually

4992
01:29:12,229 --> 01:29:12,239
so they're actually
 

4993
01:29:12,239 --> 01:29:14,070
so they're actually
based standardized objects it's amazing

4994
01:29:14,070 --> 01:29:14,080
based standardized objects it's amazing
 

4995
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:16,149
based standardized objects it's amazing
those objects are standardized as that

4996
01:29:16,149 --> 01:29:16,159
those objects are standardized as that
 

4997
01:29:16,159 --> 01:29:19,110
those objects are standardized as that
um can be so big and can lurk in the

4998
01:29:19,110 --> 01:29:19,120
um can be so big and can lurk in the
 

4999
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:21,669
um can be so big and can lurk in the
vessel solar system and so

5000
01:29:21,669 --> 01:29:21,679
vessel solar system and so
 

5001
01:29:21,679 --> 01:29:25,110
vessel solar system and so
that's the situation for a really formed

5002
01:29:25,110 --> 01:29:25,120
that's the situation for a really formed
 

5003
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:26,629
that's the situation for a really formed
black hole but the way they form

5004
01:29:26,629 --> 01:29:26,639
black hole but the way they form
 

5005
01:29:26,639 --> 01:29:30,149
black hole but the way they form
obviously is very messy and complicated

5006
01:29:30,149 --> 01:29:30,159
obviously is very messy and complicated
 

5007
01:29:30,159 --> 01:29:31,990
obviously is very messy and complicated
and

5008
01:29:31,990 --> 01:29:32,000
and
 

5009
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,910
and
one of the things that i've worked on a

5010
01:29:33,910 --> 01:29:33,920
one of the things that i've worked on a
 

5011
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:35,669
one of the things that i've worked on a
lot is

5012
01:29:35,669 --> 01:29:35,679
lot is
 

5013
01:29:35,679 --> 01:29:37,590
lot is
what the phenomena are

5014
01:29:37,590 --> 01:29:37,600
what the phenomena are
 

5015
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:39,510
what the phenomena are
which are best attributed to black holes

5016
01:29:39,510 --> 01:29:39,520
which are best attributed to black holes
 

5017
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:41,669
which are best attributed to black holes
and what may lead to them and all that

5018
01:29:41,669 --> 01:29:41,679
and what may lead to them and all that
 

5019
01:29:41,679 --> 01:29:44,390
and what may lead to them and all that
and um uh which can you explain to that

5020
01:29:44,390 --> 01:29:44,400
and um uh which can you explain to that
 

5021
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:45,830
and um uh which can you explain to that
so what what what are the different

5022
01:29:45,830 --> 01:29:45,840
so what what what are the different
 

5023
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:47,750
so what what what are the different
phenomena that lead to a black hole okay

5024
01:29:47,750 --> 01:29:47,760
phenomena that lead to a black hole okay
 

5025
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:49,830
phenomena that lead to a black hole okay
let's let's talk about it this is okay

5026
01:29:49,830 --> 01:29:49,840
let's let's talk about it this is okay
 

5027
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:53,030
let's let's talk about it this is okay
well that's so cool yes okay okay

5028
01:29:53,030 --> 01:29:53,040
well that's so cool yes okay okay
 

5029
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:55,510
well that's so cool yes okay okay
well i mean i think one thing that

5030
01:29:55,510 --> 01:29:55,520
well i mean i think one thing that
 

5031
01:29:55,520 --> 01:29:57,149
well i mean i think one thing that
only became understood really in the

5032
01:29:57,149 --> 01:29:57,159
only became understood really in the
 

5033
01:29:57,159 --> 01:30:01,830
only became understood really in the
1950s i suppose and beyond was

5034
01:30:01,830 --> 01:30:01,840
1950s i suppose and beyond was
 

5035
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:04,709
1950s i suppose and beyond was
how stars evolve differently depending

5036
01:30:04,709 --> 01:30:04,719
how stars evolve differently depending
 

5037
01:30:04,719 --> 01:30:07,669
how stars evolve differently depending
on how heavy they are yeah this the sun

5038
01:30:07,669 --> 01:30:07,679
on how heavy they are yeah this the sun
 

5039
01:30:07,679 --> 01:30:10,470
on how heavy they are yeah this the sun
um burns highs into helium and then when

5040
01:30:10,470 --> 01:30:10,480
um burns highs into helium and then when
 

5041
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:12,470
um burns highs into helium and then when
it's run out of that it contracts to be

5042
01:30:12,470 --> 01:30:12,480
it's run out of that it contracts to be
 

5043
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:14,950
it's run out of that it contracts to be
a white dwarf and we know how long that

5044
01:30:14,950 --> 01:30:14,960
a white dwarf and we know how long that
 

5045
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:16,470
a white dwarf and we know how long that
will take to take about 10 billion years

5046
01:30:16,470 --> 01:30:16,480
will take to take about 10 billion years
 

5047
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:19,110
will take to take about 10 billion years
altogether for its lifetime but big

5048
01:30:19,110 --> 01:30:19,120
altogether for its lifetime but big
 

5049
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:20,870
altogether for its lifetime but big
stars

5050
01:30:20,870 --> 01:30:20,880
stars
 

5051
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:23,189
stars
burn up their fuel more quickly

5052
01:30:23,189 --> 01:30:23,199
burn up their fuel more quickly
 

5053
01:30:23,199 --> 01:30:24,310
burn up their fuel more quickly
and more interestingly because when

5054
01:30:24,310 --> 01:30:24,320
and more interestingly because when
 

5055
01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:26,470
and more interestingly because when
they've turned highs into helium

5056
01:30:26,470 --> 01:30:26,480
they've turned highs into helium
 

5057
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:28,070
they've turned highs into helium
they then get even hotter so they can

5058
01:30:28,070 --> 01:30:28,080
they then get even hotter so they can
 

5059
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:30,390
they then get even hotter so they can
fuse helium into carbon and go up the

5060
01:30:30,390 --> 01:30:30,400
fuse helium into carbon and go up the
 

5061
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:31,910
fuse helium into carbon and go up the
periodic table

5062
01:30:31,910 --> 01:30:31,920
periodic table
 

5063
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:34,470
periodic table
and then they eventually explode

5064
01:30:34,470 --> 01:30:34,480
and then they eventually explode
 

5065
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:36,470
and then they eventually explode
when they have an energy crisis and they

5066
01:30:36,470 --> 01:30:36,480
when they have an energy crisis and they
 

5067
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:39,030
when they have an energy crisis and they
blow out that process material which as

5068
01:30:39,030 --> 01:30:39,040
blow out that process material which as
 

5069
01:30:39,040 --> 01:30:40,709
blow out that process material which as
a digression is crucially important

5070
01:30:40,709 --> 01:30:40,719
a digression is crucially important
 

5071
01:30:40,719 --> 01:30:43,510
a digression is crucially important
because um all the atoms inside our

5072
01:30:43,510 --> 01:30:43,520
because um all the atoms inside our
 

5073
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:44,870
because um all the atoms inside our
bodies

5074
01:30:44,870 --> 01:30:44,880
bodies
 

5075
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:47,669
bodies
were synthesized inside a star

5076
01:30:47,669 --> 01:30:47,679
were synthesized inside a star
 

5077
01:30:47,679 --> 01:30:49,350
were synthesized inside a star
a star that lived and died more than

5078
01:30:49,350 --> 01:30:49,360
a star that lived and died more than
 

5079
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:51,030
a star that lived and died more than
five billion years ago before our

5080
01:30:51,030 --> 01:30:51,040
five billion years ago before our
 

5081
01:30:51,040 --> 01:30:53,430
five billion years ago before our
services and formed and so we each have

5082
01:30:53,430 --> 01:30:53,440
services and formed and so we each have
 

5083
01:30:53,440 --> 01:30:55,590
services and formed and so we each have
inside us atoms made in thousands of

5084
01:30:55,590 --> 01:30:55,600
inside us atoms made in thousands of
 

5085
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:57,590
inside us atoms made in thousands of
different stars all over the milky way

5086
01:30:57,590 --> 01:30:57,600
different stars all over the milky way
 

5087
01:30:57,600 --> 01:30:59,189
different stars all over the milky way
and that's an amazing idea in my

5088
01:30:59,189 --> 01:30:59,199
and that's an amazing idea in my
 

5089
01:30:59,199 --> 01:31:02,229
and that's an amazing idea in my
predecessor fred hoyle in 1946 was the

5090
01:31:02,229 --> 01:31:02,239
predecessor fred hoyle in 1946 was the
 

5091
01:31:02,239 --> 01:31:04,149
predecessor fred hoyle in 1946 was the
first person to suggest that idea and

5092
01:31:04,149 --> 01:31:04,159
first person to suggest that idea and
 

5093
01:31:04,159 --> 01:31:05,590
first person to suggest that idea and
that's been borne out that's a wonderful

5094
01:31:05,590 --> 01:31:05,600
that's been borne out that's a wonderful
 

5095
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:06,550
that's been borne out that's a wonderful
idea

5096
01:31:06,550 --> 01:31:06,560
idea
 

5097
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:07,270
idea
so

5098
01:31:07,270 --> 01:31:07,280
so
 

5099
01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:10,709
so
that's how massive stars explode and

5100
01:31:10,709 --> 01:31:10,719
that's how massive stars explode and
 

5101
01:31:10,719 --> 01:31:12,709
that's how massive stars explode and
they leave behind

5102
01:31:12,709 --> 01:31:12,719
they leave behind
 

5103
01:31:12,719 --> 01:31:14,229
they leave behind
something which

5104
01:31:14,229 --> 01:31:14,239
something which
 

5105
01:31:14,239 --> 01:31:16,790
something which
is very exotic and of two kinds one

5106
01:31:16,790 --> 01:31:16,800
is very exotic and of two kinds one
 

5107
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:19,030
is very exotic and of two kinds one
possibility is a neutron star and these

5108
01:31:19,030 --> 01:31:19,040
possibility is a neutron star and these
 

5109
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:21,750
possibility is a neutron star and these
were first discovered in 1967

5110
01:31:21,750 --> 01:31:21,760
were first discovered in 1967
 

5111
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:24,790
were first discovered in 1967
68. um these are stars a bit heavier

5112
01:31:24,790 --> 01:31:24,800
68. um these are stars a bit heavier
 

5113
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:26,070
68. um these are stars a bit heavier
than the sun

5114
01:31:26,070 --> 01:31:26,080
than the sun
 

5115
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:28,470
than the sun
uh which are compressed to an amazing

5116
01:31:28,470 --> 01:31:28,480
uh which are compressed to an amazing
 

5117
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:31,350
uh which are compressed to an amazing
density so the whole mass of more than

5118
01:31:31,350 --> 01:31:31,360
density so the whole mass of more than
 

5119
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:33,990
density so the whole mass of more than
the sun's mass is in something about 10

5120
01:31:33,990 --> 01:31:34,000
the sun's mass is in something about 10
 

5121
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,070
the sun's mass is in something about 10
miles across

5122
01:31:36,070 --> 01:31:36,080
miles across
 

5123
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:37,270
miles across
so

5124
01:31:37,270 --> 01:31:37,280
so
 

5125
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:39,430
so
they're extraordinarily dense

5126
01:31:39,430 --> 01:31:39,440
they're extraordinarily dense
 

5127
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:41,830
they're extraordinarily dense
the exotic physics

5128
01:31:41,830 --> 01:31:41,840
the exotic physics
 

5129
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:43,830
the exotic physics
and

5130
01:31:43,830 --> 01:31:43,840
and
 

5131
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:45,590
and
and they they've

5132
01:31:45,590 --> 01:31:45,600
and they they've
 

5133
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:47,910
and they they've
they've been studied in immense detail

5134
01:31:47,910 --> 01:31:47,920
they've been studied in immense detail
 

5135
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:49,430
they've been studied in immense detail
and they've been real laboratories

5136
01:31:49,430 --> 01:31:49,440
and they've been real laboratories
 

5137
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:50,870
and they've been real laboratories
because the good thing about astronomy

5138
01:31:50,870 --> 01:31:50,880
because the good thing about astronomy
 

5139
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:51,910
because the good thing about astronomy
apart from

5140
01:31:51,910 --> 01:31:51,920
apart from
 

5141
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:54,310
apart from
exploring what's out there is to use the

5142
01:31:54,310 --> 01:31:54,320
exploring what's out there is to use the
 

5143
01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:55,910
exploring what's out there is to use the
fact that the cosmos has provided us

5144
01:31:55,910 --> 01:31:55,920
fact that the cosmos has provided us
 

5145
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:57,910
fact that the cosmos has provided us
with a lab with far more extreme

5146
01:31:57,910 --> 01:31:57,920
with a lab with far more extreme
 

5147
01:31:57,920 --> 01:31:59,910
with a lab with far more extreme
conditions that we could ever simulate

5148
01:31:59,910 --> 01:31:59,920
conditions that we could ever simulate
 

5149
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:01,350
conditions that we could ever simulate
and so we learned lots of basic physics

5150
01:32:01,350 --> 01:32:01,360
and so we learned lots of basic physics
 

5151
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:03,430
and so we learned lots of basic physics
from looking at these objects um and

5152
01:32:03,430 --> 01:32:03,440
from looking at these objects um and
 

5153
01:32:03,440 --> 01:32:05,350
from looking at these objects um and
that's been true neutrons but for black

5154
01:32:05,350 --> 01:32:05,360
that's been true neutrons but for black
 

5155
01:32:05,360 --> 01:32:06,310
that's been true neutrons but for black
holes

5156
01:32:06,310 --> 01:32:06,320
holes
 

5157
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:09,350
holes
that's even more true because the um

5158
01:32:09,350 --> 01:32:09,360
that's even more true because the um
 

5159
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:10,870
that's even more true because the um
bigger stars

5160
01:32:10,870 --> 01:32:10,880
bigger stars
 

5161
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:12,470
bigger stars
when they collapse they

5162
01:32:12,470 --> 01:32:12,480
when they collapse they
 

5163
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:13,750
when they collapse they
leave something

5164
01:32:13,750 --> 01:32:13,760
leave something
 

5165
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:16,070
leave something
behind in the center which is too big to

5166
01:32:16,070 --> 01:32:16,080
behind in the center which is too big to
 

5167
01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:18,070
behind in the center which is too big to
be a stable by two or four neutron star

5168
01:32:18,070 --> 01:32:18,080
be a stable by two or four neutron star
 

5169
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:19,590
be a stable by two or four neutron star
becomes a black hole

5170
01:32:19,590 --> 01:32:19,600
becomes a black hole
 

5171
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:21,750
becomes a black hole
and we know that there are lots of black

5172
01:32:21,750 --> 01:32:21,760
and we know that there are lots of black
 

5173
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:23,430
and we know that there are lots of black
holes weighing about

5174
01:32:23,430 --> 01:32:23,440
holes weighing about
 

5175
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:26,950
holes weighing about
10 or up to 50 times as much as the sun

5176
01:32:26,950 --> 01:32:26,960
10 or up to 50 times as much as the sun
 

5177
01:32:26,960 --> 01:32:29,669
10 or up to 50 times as much as the sun
which are the remnants of stars they

5178
01:32:29,669 --> 01:32:29,679
which are the remnants of stars they
 

5179
01:32:29,679 --> 01:32:32,550
which are the remnants of stars they
were detected first 50 years ago

5180
01:32:32,550 --> 01:32:32,560
were detected first 50 years ago
 

5181
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:35,110
were detected first 50 years ago
when a black hole was orbiting around

5182
01:32:35,110 --> 01:32:35,120
when a black hole was orbiting around
 

5183
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:36,470
when a black hole was orbiting around
another star

5184
01:32:36,470 --> 01:32:36,480
another star
 

5185
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:38,950
another star
and grabbing material from the other

5186
01:32:38,950 --> 01:32:38,960
and grabbing material from the other
 

5187
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:41,510
and grabbing material from the other
star which swirled into it and gave us

5188
01:32:41,510 --> 01:32:41,520
star which swirled into it and gave us
 

5189
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:44,470
star which swirled into it and gave us
x-rays so the x-rays astronomers found

5190
01:32:44,470 --> 01:32:44,480
x-rays so the x-rays astronomers found
 

5191
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:46,709
x-rays so the x-rays astronomers found
these um

5192
01:32:46,709 --> 01:32:46,719
these um
 

5193
01:32:46,719 --> 01:32:49,990
these um
objects orbiting around an ordinary star

5194
01:32:49,990 --> 01:32:50,000
objects orbiting around an ordinary star
 

5195
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,390
objects orbiting around an ordinary star
and emitting x-ray radiation very

5196
01:32:52,390 --> 01:32:52,400
and emitting x-ray radiation very
 

5197
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:53,669
and emitting x-ray radiation very
intensely

5198
01:32:53,669 --> 01:32:53,679
intensely
 

5199
01:32:53,679 --> 01:32:55,910
intensely
varying on the baseball time scale so

5200
01:32:55,910 --> 01:32:55,920
varying on the baseball time scale so
 

5201
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:57,590
varying on the baseball time scale so
something very small and dense was

5202
01:32:57,590 --> 01:32:57,600
something very small and dense was
 

5203
01:32:57,600 --> 01:32:59,350
something very small and dense was
giving that radiation that was the first

5204
01:32:59,350 --> 01:32:59,360
giving that radiation that was the first
 

5205
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:01,350
giving that radiation that was the first
evidence for black holes but then the

5206
01:33:01,350 --> 01:33:01,360
evidence for black holes but then the
 

5207
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:03,510
evidence for black holes but then the
other thing that happened was realizing

5208
01:33:03,510 --> 01:33:03,520
other thing that happened was realizing
 

5209
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:04,950
other thing that happened was realizing
that there was a

5210
01:33:04,950 --> 01:33:04,960
that there was a
 

5211
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:07,350
that there was a
different class of monster black holes

5212
01:33:07,350 --> 01:33:07,360
different class of monster black holes
 

5213
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:09,830
different class of monster black holes
in the center of galaxies

5214
01:33:09,830 --> 01:33:09,840
in the center of galaxies
 

5215
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:11,030
in the center of galaxies
and um

5216
01:33:11,030 --> 01:33:11,040
and um
 

5217
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:12,470
and um
these are responsible what's called

5218
01:33:12,470 --> 01:33:12,480
these are responsible what's called
 

5219
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:14,790
these are responsible what's called
quasars which is when uh

5220
01:33:14,790 --> 01:33:14,800
quasars which is when uh
 

5221
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:16,790
quasars which is when uh
something in the center of a galaxy

5222
01:33:16,790 --> 01:33:16,800
something in the center of a galaxy
 

5223
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:19,669
something in the center of a galaxy
is grabbing some fuel and outshines all

5224
01:33:19,669 --> 01:33:19,679
is grabbing some fuel and outshines all
 

5225
01:33:19,679 --> 01:33:20,629
is grabbing some fuel and outshines all
the

5226
01:33:20,629 --> 01:33:20,639
the
 

5227
01:33:20,639 --> 01:33:22,950
the
100 billion stars or so in the rest of

5228
01:33:22,950 --> 01:33:22,960
100 billion stars or so in the rest of
 

5229
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:25,110
100 billion stars or so in the rest of
the galaxy giant beam

5230
01:33:25,110 --> 01:33:25,120
the galaxy giant beam
 

5231
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:25,830
the galaxy giant beam
yeah

5232
01:33:25,830 --> 01:33:25,840
yeah
 

5233
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:27,510
yeah
white and in many cases it should be it

5234
01:33:27,510 --> 01:33:27,520
white and in many cases it should be it
 

5235
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:28,950
white and in many cases it should be it
should be it should be

5236
01:33:28,950 --> 01:33:28,960
should be it should be
 

5237
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:29,830
should be it should be
is that

5238
01:33:29,830 --> 01:33:29,840
is that
 

5239
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:31,830
is that
yeah that's got to be the most epic

5240
01:33:31,830 --> 01:33:31,840
yeah that's got to be the most epic
 

5241
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:34,830
yeah that's got to be the most epic
thing the universe produces is quasars

5242
01:33:34,830 --> 01:33:34,840
thing the universe produces is quasars
 

5243
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:36,950
thing the universe produces is quasars
um well it's a it's a debate about the

5244
01:33:36,950 --> 01:33:36,960
um well it's a it's a debate about the
 

5245
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:38,310
um well it's a it's a debate about the
most epic but uh

5246
01:33:38,310 --> 01:33:38,320
most epic but uh
 

5247
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:40,470
most epic but uh
quasars maybe or maybe gamma ray bursts

5248
01:33:40,470 --> 01:33:40,480
quasars maybe or maybe gamma ray bursts
 

5249
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:42,070
quasars maybe or maybe gamma ray bursts
or something but but they're they are

5250
01:33:42,070 --> 01:33:42,080
or something but but they're they are
 

5251
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:44,470
or something but but they're they are
remarkable and they were a mystery for a

5252
01:33:44,470 --> 01:33:44,480
remarkable and they were a mystery for a
 

5253
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:46,390
remarkable and they were a mystery for a
long time and there weren't things i

5254
01:33:46,390 --> 01:33:46,400
long time and there weren't things i
 

5255
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:47,990
long time and there weren't things i
worked on in my

5256
01:33:47,990 --> 01:33:48,000
worked on in my
 

5257
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:49,830
worked on in my
younger days so even though they're so

5258
01:33:49,830 --> 01:33:49,840
younger days so even though they're so
 

5259
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:52,229
younger days so even though they're so
bright they're still a mystery and but

5260
01:33:52,229 --> 01:33:52,239
bright they're still a mystery and but
 

5261
01:33:52,239 --> 01:33:53,990
bright they're still a mystery and but
well i wouldn't say i can only see them

5262
01:33:53,990 --> 01:33:54,000
well i wouldn't say i can only see them
 

5263
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:55,270
well i wouldn't say i can only see them
they're a little mystery now i think we

5264
01:33:55,270 --> 01:33:55,280
they're a little mystery now i think we
 

5265
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:58,070
they're a little mystery now i think we
do understand basically what's going on

5266
01:33:58,070 --> 01:33:58,080
do understand basically what's going on
 

5267
01:33:58,080 --> 01:34:00,390
do understand basically what's going on
how were quasars discovered

5268
01:34:00,390 --> 01:34:00,400
how were quasars discovered
 

5269
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:02,390
how were quasars discovered
well they were discovered when

5270
01:34:02,390 --> 01:34:02,400
well they were discovered when
 

5271
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:04,149
well they were discovered when
astronomers found things that looked

5272
01:34:04,149 --> 01:34:04,159
astronomers found things that looked
 

5273
01:34:04,159 --> 01:34:06,070
astronomers found things that looked
like stars and that they were small

5274
01:34:06,070 --> 01:34:06,080
like stars and that they were small
 

5275
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:08,070
like stars and that they were small
enough to be a point-like and not

5276
01:34:08,070 --> 01:34:08,080
enough to be a point-like and not
 

5277
01:34:08,080 --> 01:34:10,870
enough to be a point-like and not
resolved by a telescope but uh uh

5278
01:34:10,870 --> 01:34:10,880
resolved by a telescope but uh uh
 

5279
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:13,430
resolved by a telescope but uh uh
outshone an entire galaxy

5280
01:34:13,430 --> 01:34:13,440
outshone an entire galaxy
 

5281
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:16,629
outshone an entire galaxy
yeah and uh that is suspicious yes

5282
01:34:16,629 --> 01:34:16,639
yeah and uh that is suspicious yes
 

5283
01:34:16,639 --> 01:34:24,229
yeah and uh that is suspicious yes
but uh

5284
01:34:24,229 --> 01:34:24,239

 

5285
01:34:24,239 --> 01:34:26,310

which you now know are black holes

5286
01:34:26,310 --> 01:34:26,320
which you now know are black holes
 

5287
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:28,470
which you now know are black holes
and they were um

5288
01:34:28,470 --> 01:34:28,480
and they were um
 

5289
01:34:28,480 --> 01:34:30,790
and they were um
black holes were capturing gas

5290
01:34:30,790 --> 01:34:30,800
black holes were capturing gas
 

5291
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:33,030
black holes were capturing gas
and that gas was getting very hot but it

5292
01:34:33,030 --> 01:34:33,040
and that gas was getting very hot but it
 

5293
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:35,030
and that gas was getting very hot but it
was producing um

5294
01:34:35,030 --> 01:34:35,040
was producing um
 

5295
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:37,910
was producing um
far more energy than all the stars added

5296
01:34:37,910 --> 01:34:37,920
far more energy than all the stars added
 

5297
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:41,590
far more energy than all the stars added
together and it was the energy of the

5298
01:34:41,590 --> 01:34:41,600
together and it was the energy of the
 

5299
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:42,870
together and it was the energy of the
black hole

5300
01:34:42,870 --> 01:34:42,880
black hole
 

5301
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:45,030
black hole
that was um lighting up all the gas in

5302
01:34:45,030 --> 01:34:45,040
that was um lighting up all the gas in
 

5303
01:34:45,040 --> 01:34:46,709
that was um lighting up all the gas in
the galaxy so you've got a spectrum of

5304
01:34:46,709 --> 01:34:46,719
the galaxy so you've got a spectrum of
 

5305
01:34:46,719 --> 01:34:47,590
the galaxy so you've got a spectrum of
it

5306
01:34:47,590 --> 01:34:47,600
it
 

5307
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:48,870
it
there so so

5308
01:34:48,870 --> 01:34:48,880
there so so
 

5309
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:50,870
there so so
this was something which was realized

5310
01:34:50,870 --> 01:34:50,880
this was something which was realized
 

5311
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:53,510
this was something which was realized
from the 1970s onwards

5312
01:34:53,510 --> 01:34:53,520
from the 1970s onwards
 

5313
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:55,510
from the 1970s onwards
and uh as you say the other thing we've

5314
01:34:55,510 --> 01:34:55,520
and uh as you say the other thing we've
 

5315
01:34:55,520 --> 01:34:57,430
and uh as you say the other thing we've
learned is that they often do produce

5316
01:34:57,430 --> 01:34:57,440
learned is that they often do produce
 

5317
01:34:57,440 --> 01:35:00,149
learned is that they often do produce
these jets squirting out um which could

5318
01:35:00,149 --> 01:35:00,159
these jets squirting out um which could
 

5319
01:35:00,159 --> 01:35:03,750
these jets squirting out um which could
be detected in in all wave bands so um

5320
01:35:03,750 --> 01:35:03,760
be detected in in all wave bands so um
 

5321
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:05,430
be detected in in all wave bands so um
there's now a standard picture yeah

5322
01:35:05,430 --> 01:35:05,440
there's now a standard picture yeah
 

5323
01:35:05,440 --> 01:35:08,390
there's now a standard picture yeah
black hole generating jets of light yeah

5324
01:35:08,390 --> 01:35:08,400
black hole generating jets of light yeah
 

5325
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:09,990
black hole generating jets of light yeah
the center of most

5326
01:35:09,990 --> 01:35:10,000
the center of most
 

5327
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,470
the center of most
galaxies yes that's right do we know

5328
01:35:12,470 --> 01:35:12,480
galaxies yes that's right do we know
 

5329
01:35:12,480 --> 01:35:14,629
galaxies yes that's right do we know
do you ever sense if every galaxy has

5330
01:35:14,629 --> 01:35:14,639
do you ever sense if every galaxy has
 

5331
01:35:14,639 --> 01:35:16,149
do you ever sense if every galaxy has
one of these big

5332
01:35:16,149 --> 01:35:16,159
one of these big
 

5333
01:35:16,159 --> 01:35:17,350
one of these big
big boys

5334
01:35:17,350 --> 01:35:17,360
big boys
 

5335
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:20,070
big boys
big black holes most galaxies have big

5336
01:35:20,070 --> 01:35:20,080
big black holes most galaxies have big
 

5337
01:35:20,080 --> 01:35:21,910
big black holes most galaxies have big
black holes they vary in size the one in

5338
01:35:21,910 --> 01:35:21,920
black holes they vary in size the one in
 

5339
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:22,629
black holes they vary in size the one in
our

5340
01:35:22,629 --> 01:35:22,639
our
 

5341
01:35:22,639 --> 01:35:24,790
our
galactic center do we know much about

5342
01:35:24,790 --> 01:35:24,800
galactic center do we know much about
 

5343
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:25,750
galactic center do we know much about
ours

5344
01:35:25,750 --> 01:35:25,760
ours
 

5345
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:29,510
ours
we we do yes we um we know um uh it

5346
01:35:29,510 --> 01:35:29,520
we we do yes we um we know um uh it
 

5347
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:31,750
we we do yes we um we know um uh it
weighs about as much as four million

5348
01:35:31,750 --> 01:35:31,760
weighs about as much as four million
 

5349
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:32,950
weighs about as much as four million
suns

5350
01:35:32,950 --> 01:35:32,960
suns
 

5351
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:34,790
suns
uh which is less than some is there

5352
01:35:34,790 --> 01:35:34,800
uh which is less than some is there
 

5353
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:37,669
uh which is less than some is there
several billion in other galaxies um and

5354
01:35:37,669 --> 01:35:37,679
several billion in other galaxies um and
 

5355
01:35:37,679 --> 01:35:39,990
several billion in other galaxies um and
but we know this um the one narcotic

5356
01:35:39,990 --> 01:35:40,000
but we know this um the one narcotic
 

5357
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:41,510
but we know this um the one narcotic
center isn't

5358
01:35:41,510 --> 01:35:41,520
center isn't
 

5359
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:44,310
center isn't
very bright or conspicuous and that's

5360
01:35:44,310 --> 01:35:44,320
very bright or conspicuous and that's
 

5361
01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:45,830
very bright or conspicuous and that's
because not much is falling into it at

5362
01:35:45,830 --> 01:35:45,840
because not much is falling into it at
 

5363
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:47,669
because not much is falling into it at
the moment if if a black hole is

5364
01:35:47,669 --> 01:35:47,679
the moment if if a black hole is
 

5365
01:35:47,679 --> 01:35:49,590
the moment if if a black hole is
isolated then of course it doesn't

5366
01:35:49,590 --> 01:35:49,600
isolated then of course it doesn't
 

5367
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:51,510
isolated then of course it doesn't
radiate it only

5368
01:35:51,510 --> 01:35:51,520
radiate it only
 

5369
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:53,669
radiate it only
all that radiates is gas

5370
01:35:53,669 --> 01:35:53,679
all that radiates is gas
 

5371
01:35:53,679 --> 01:35:55,430
all that radiates is gas
swirling into it

5372
01:35:55,430 --> 01:35:55,440
swirling into it
 

5373
01:35:55,440 --> 01:35:57,430
swirling into it
which is very hot or has magnetic space

5374
01:35:57,430 --> 01:35:57,440
which is very hot or has magnetic space
 

5375
01:35:57,440 --> 01:35:58,950
which is very hot or has magnetic space
it's only radiating the thing it's

5376
01:35:58,950 --> 01:35:58,960
it's only radiating the thing it's
 

5377
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:01,270
it's only radiating the thing it's
murdering or consuming right or however

5378
01:36:01,270 --> 01:36:01,280
murdering or consuming right or however
 

5379
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:03,750
murdering or consuming right or however
you put it yeah that's right and so so

5380
01:36:03,750 --> 01:36:03,760
you put it yeah that's right and so so
 

5381
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:05,910
you put it yeah that's right and so so
um it's thought that our galaxy may have

5382
01:36:05,910 --> 01:36:05,920
um it's thought that our galaxy may have
 

5383
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:07,669
um it's thought that our galaxy may have
been bright bright at some time in the

5384
01:36:07,669 --> 01:36:07,679
been bright bright at some time in the
 

5385
01:36:07,679 --> 01:36:11,350
been bright bright at some time in the
past but now uh and that's when the

5386
01:36:11,350 --> 01:36:11,360
past but now uh and that's when the
 

5387
01:36:11,360 --> 01:36:14,149
past but now uh and that's when the
black hole formed or grew um but but now

5388
01:36:14,149 --> 01:36:14,159
black hole formed or grew um but but now
 

5389
01:36:14,159 --> 01:36:17,510
black hole formed or grew um but but now
it's uh not um capturing very much gas

5390
01:36:17,510 --> 01:36:17,520
it's uh not um capturing very much gas
 

5391
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:19,750
it's uh not um capturing very much gas
and so it's it's rather it's one of the

5392
01:36:19,750 --> 01:36:19,760
and so it's it's rather it's one of the
 

5393
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:22,550
and so it's it's rather it's one of the
faints and only detected indirectly and

5394
01:36:22,550 --> 01:36:22,560
faints and only detected indirectly and
 

5395
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:25,510
faints and only detected indirectly and
by fairly weak radio mission and uh and

5396
01:36:25,510 --> 01:36:25,520
by fairly weak radio mission and uh and
 

5397
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:27,270
by fairly weak radio mission and uh and
so i think the answer to your question

5398
01:36:27,270 --> 01:36:27,280
so i think the answer to your question
 

5399
01:36:27,280 --> 01:36:29,510
so i think the answer to your question
is that um

5400
01:36:29,510 --> 01:36:29,520
is that um
 

5401
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:31,830
is that um
we suspect that most galaxies have a

5402
01:36:31,830 --> 01:36:31,840
we suspect that most galaxies have a
 

5403
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:33,270
we suspect that most galaxies have a
black hole in them

5404
01:36:33,270 --> 01:36:33,280
black hole in them
 

5405
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:34,950
black hole in them
so that means at some stage in their

5406
01:36:34,950 --> 01:36:34,960
so that means at some stage in their
 

5407
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:36,310
so that means at some stage in their
lives

5408
01:36:36,310 --> 01:36:36,320
lives
 

5409
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:38,390
lives
or maybe one or more stages they went

5410
01:36:38,390 --> 01:36:38,400
or maybe one or more stages they went
 

5411
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:40,229
or maybe one or more stages they went
through a phase of being like a quasar

5412
01:36:40,229 --> 01:36:40,239
through a phase of being like a quasar
 

5413
01:36:40,239 --> 01:36:43,430
through a phase of being like a quasar
where that black hole um captured gas

5414
01:36:43,430 --> 01:36:43,440
where that black hole um captured gas
 

5415
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:45,189
where that black hole um captured gas
and became very very bright

5416
01:36:45,189 --> 01:36:45,199
and became very very bright
 

5417
01:36:45,199 --> 01:36:47,510
and became very very bright
but for the rest of their the lives the

5418
01:36:47,510 --> 01:36:47,520
but for the rest of their the lives the
 

5419
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:49,270
but for the rest of their the lives the
black holes are fairly questioned

5420
01:36:49,270 --> 01:36:49,280
black holes are fairly questioned
 

5421
01:36:49,280 --> 01:36:51,430
black holes are fairly questioned
because there's not much gas

5422
01:36:51,430 --> 01:36:51,440
because there's not much gas
 

5423
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:53,109
because there's not much gas
falling into them

5424
01:36:53,109 --> 01:36:53,119
falling into them
 

5425
01:36:53,119 --> 01:36:55,270
falling into them
and so this universe of ours is

5426
01:36:55,270 --> 01:36:55,280
and so this universe of ours is
 

5427
01:36:55,280 --> 01:36:57,510
and so this universe of ours is
sprinkled a bunch of galaxies and giant

5428
01:36:57,510 --> 01:36:57,520
sprinkled a bunch of galaxies and giant
 

5429
01:36:57,520 --> 01:37:00,550
sprinkled a bunch of galaxies and giant
black holes it was

5430
01:37:00,550 --> 01:37:00,560
black holes it was
 

5431
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:01,830
black holes it was
like

5432
01:37:01,830 --> 01:37:01,840
like
 

5433
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:04,229
like
very large number of stars

5434
01:37:04,229 --> 01:37:04,239
very large number of stars
 

5435
01:37:04,239 --> 01:37:07,270
very large number of stars
uh orbiting these black holes and then

5436
01:37:07,270 --> 01:37:07,280
uh orbiting these black holes and then
 

5437
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:09,109
uh orbiting these black holes and then
planets orbiting

5438
01:37:09,109 --> 01:37:09,119
planets orbiting
 

5439
01:37:09,119 --> 01:37:11,189
planets orbiting
likely it seems like

5440
01:37:11,189 --> 01:37:11,199
likely it seems like
 

5441
01:37:11,199 --> 01:37:13,270
likely it seems like
planets orbiting almost every one of

5442
01:37:13,270 --> 01:37:13,280
planets orbiting almost every one of
 

5443
01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:16,070
planets orbiting almost every one of
those stars

5444
01:37:16,070 --> 01:37:16,080

 

5445
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:19,030

and just this beautiful universe of ours

5446
01:37:19,030 --> 01:37:19,040
and just this beautiful universe of ours
 

5447
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:21,669
and just this beautiful universe of ours
well what happens when galaxies collide

5448
01:37:21,669 --> 01:37:21,679
well what happens when galaxies collide
 

5449
01:37:21,679 --> 01:37:24,550
well what happens when galaxies collide
when these two big black holes

5450
01:37:24,550 --> 01:37:24,560
when these two big black holes
 

5451
01:37:24,560 --> 01:37:26,070
when these two big black holes
collide is that

5452
01:37:26,070 --> 01:37:26,080
collide is that
 

5453
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:26,950
collide is that
is

5454
01:37:26,950 --> 01:37:26,960
is
 

5455
01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:30,070
is
well um what would happen is that uh

5456
01:37:30,070 --> 01:37:30,080
well um what would happen is that uh
 

5457
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:32,229
well um what would happen is that uh
well and i should say that um this is

5458
01:37:32,229 --> 01:37:32,239
well and i should say that um this is
 

5459
01:37:32,239 --> 01:37:34,550
well and i should say that um this is
going to happen near us one day but not

5460
01:37:34,550 --> 01:37:34,560
going to happen near us one day but not
 

5461
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:35,830
going to happen near us one day but not
for four billion years because the

5462
01:37:35,830 --> 01:37:35,840
for four billion years because the
 

5463
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:38,229
for four billion years because the
andromeda galaxy which is the biggest

5464
01:37:38,229 --> 01:37:38,239
andromeda galaxy which is the biggest
 

5465
01:37:38,239 --> 01:37:39,590
andromeda galaxy which is the biggest
galaxy

5466
01:37:39,590 --> 01:37:39,600
galaxy
 

5467
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:41,750
galaxy
near to us which is about

5468
01:37:41,750 --> 01:37:41,760
near to us which is about
 

5469
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:44,149
near to us which is about
three million light years away which is

5470
01:37:44,149 --> 01:37:44,159
three million light years away which is
 

5471
01:37:44,159 --> 01:37:46,629
three million light years away which is
a big disc galaxy with a black hole is

5472
01:37:46,629 --> 01:37:46,639
a big disc galaxy with a black hole is
 

5473
01:37:46,639 --> 01:37:49,590
a big disc galaxy with a black hole is
hub rather like our milky way and um

5474
01:37:49,590 --> 01:37:49,600
hub rather like our milky way and um
 

5475
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:52,229
hub rather like our milky way and um
that's uh um in

5476
01:37:52,229 --> 01:37:52,239
that's uh um in
 

5477
01:37:52,239 --> 01:37:53,910
that's uh um in
falling towards us because they're both

5478
01:37:53,910 --> 01:37:53,920
falling towards us because they're both
 

5479
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:56,709
falling towards us because they're both
in a common gravitational potential well

5480
01:37:56,709 --> 01:37:56,719
in a common gravitational potential well
 

5481
01:37:56,719 --> 01:37:57,750
in a common gravitational potential well
and um

5482
01:37:57,750 --> 01:37:57,760
and um
 

5483
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:59,750
and um
that will collide with our galaxy in

5484
01:37:59,750 --> 01:37:59,760
that will collide with our galaxy in
 

5485
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:01,510
that will collide with our galaxy in
about four billion years but it'll be

5486
01:38:01,510 --> 01:38:01,520
about four billion years but it'll be
 

5487
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:02,790
about four billion years but it'll be
it'll be

5488
01:38:02,790 --> 01:38:02,800
it'll be
 

5489
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:04,470
it'll be
maybe it'll be less a collision and more

5490
01:38:04,470 --> 01:38:04,480
maybe it'll be less a collision and more
 

5491
01:38:04,480 --> 01:38:06,229
maybe it'll be less a collision and more
of a dance because it'll be like a

5492
01:38:06,229 --> 01:38:06,239
of a dance because it'll be like a
 

5493
01:38:06,239 --> 01:38:08,070
of a dance because it'll be like a
swirling situation

5494
01:38:08,070 --> 01:38:08,080
swirling situation
 

5495
01:38:08,080 --> 01:38:10,390
swirling situation
but eventually it'll be to be a merger

5496
01:38:10,390 --> 01:38:10,400
but eventually it'll be to be a merger
 

5497
01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:12,149
but eventually it'll be to be a merger
they'll go through each other and then

5498
01:38:12,149 --> 01:38:12,159
they'll go through each other and then
 

5499
01:38:12,159 --> 01:38:15,350
they'll go through each other and then
merge in fact uh um the nice movies to

5500
01:38:15,350 --> 01:38:15,360
merge in fact uh um the nice movies to
 

5501
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:17,270
merge in fact uh um the nice movies to
be made of this you know computer

5502
01:38:17,270 --> 01:38:17,280
be made of this you know computer
 

5503
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:20,550
be made of this you know computer
simulations yes and it'll go through um

5504
01:38:20,550 --> 01:38:20,560
simulations yes and it'll go through um
 

5505
01:38:20,560 --> 01:38:21,590
simulations yes and it'll go through um
and um

5506
01:38:21,590 --> 01:38:21,600
and um
 

5507
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:23,830
and um
and then um

5508
01:38:23,830 --> 01:38:23,840
and then um
 

5509
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:25,990
and then um
there's a black hole in the sense of

5510
01:38:25,990 --> 01:38:26,000
there's a black hole in the sense of
 

5511
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,870
there's a black hole in the sense of
andromeda and our galaxy and the galax

5512
01:38:28,870 --> 01:38:28,880
andromeda and our galaxy and the galax
 

5513
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:31,109
andromeda and our galaxy and the galax
the black holes will uh

5514
01:38:31,109 --> 01:38:31,119
the black holes will uh
 

5515
01:38:31,119 --> 01:38:34,390
the black holes will uh
settle towards the center yes then they

5516
01:38:34,390 --> 01:38:34,400
settle towards the center yes then they
 

5517
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:36,550
settle towards the center yes then they
will orbit around each other very fast

5518
01:38:36,550 --> 01:38:36,560
will orbit around each other very fast
 

5519
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:38,790
will orbit around each other very fast
and then they will eventually merge

5520
01:38:38,790 --> 01:38:38,800
and then they will eventually merge
 

5521
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:40,229
and then they will eventually merge
and that will produce a big burst of

5522
01:38:40,229 --> 01:38:40,239
and that will produce a big burst of
 

5523
01:38:40,239 --> 01:38:42,870
and that will produce a big burst of
gravitational waves yes um very big

5524
01:38:42,870 --> 01:38:42,880
gravitational waves yes um very big
 

5525
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:45,109
gravitational waves yes um very big
burst that an alien civilization with a

5526
01:38:45,109 --> 01:38:45,119
burst that an alien civilization with a
 

5527
01:38:45,119 --> 01:38:46,870
burst that an alien civilization with a
ligo-like detector would be able to

5528
01:38:46,870 --> 01:38:46,880
ligo-like detector would be able to
 

5529
01:38:46,880 --> 01:38:47,910
ligo-like detector would be able to
detect

5530
01:38:47,910 --> 01:38:47,920
detect
 

5531
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:49,510
detect
yes well in fact we will but we can

5532
01:38:49,510 --> 01:38:49,520
yes well in fact we will but we can
 

5533
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:52,149
yes well in fact we will but we can
detect these with them

5534
01:38:52,149 --> 01:38:52,159
detect these with them
 

5535
01:38:52,159 --> 01:38:54,390
detect these with them
they're lower frequencies than the uh

5536
01:38:54,390 --> 01:38:54,400
they're lower frequencies than the uh
 

5537
01:38:54,400 --> 01:38:55,990
they're lower frequencies than the uh
the waves that have been detected by

5538
01:38:55,990 --> 01:38:56,000
the waves that have been detected by
 

5539
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:59,350
the waves that have been detected by
ligo so there's a space interferometer

5540
01:38:59,350 --> 01:38:59,360
ligo so there's a space interferometer
 

5541
01:38:59,360 --> 01:39:01,510
ligo so there's a space interferometer
which can detect these they're about

5542
01:39:01,510 --> 01:39:01,520
which can detect these they're about
 

5543
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:03,910
which can detect these they're about
it's about one cycle per hour rather

5544
01:39:03,910 --> 01:39:03,920
it's about one cycle per hour rather
 

5545
01:39:03,920 --> 01:39:05,990
it's about one cycle per hour rather
than about a hundred cycles per second

5546
01:39:05,990 --> 01:39:06,000
than about a hundred cycles per second
 

5547
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,550
than about a hundred cycles per second
yes it's the ones that detect it um but

5548
01:39:08,550 --> 01:39:08,560
yes it's the ones that detect it um but
 

5549
01:39:08,560 --> 01:39:10,950
yes it's the ones that detect it um but
that that would happen but um uh

5550
01:39:10,950 --> 01:39:10,960
that that would happen but um uh
 

5551
01:39:10,960 --> 01:39:12,550
that that would happen but um uh
thinking back to what will happen in

5552
01:39:12,550 --> 01:39:12,560
thinking back to what will happen in
 

5553
01:39:12,560 --> 01:39:14,950
thinking back to what will happen in
four billion years to uh any of our

5554
01:39:14,950 --> 01:39:14,960
four billion years to uh any of our
 

5555
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:17,910
four billion years to uh any of our
descendants they'll be okay because the

5556
01:39:17,910 --> 01:39:17,920
descendants they'll be okay because the
 

5557
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:18,629
descendants they'll be okay because the
um

5558
01:39:18,629 --> 01:39:18,639
um
 

5559
01:39:18,639 --> 01:39:20,709
um
the the two disc galaxies were merged

5560
01:39:20,709 --> 01:39:20,719
the the two disc galaxies were merged
 

5561
01:39:20,719 --> 01:39:22,950
the the two disc galaxies were merged
it'll end up as a sort of amorphous

5562
01:39:22,950 --> 01:39:22,960
it'll end up as a sort of amorphous
 

5563
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:26,310
it'll end up as a sort of amorphous
elliptical galaxy but um the stars won't

5564
01:39:26,310 --> 01:39:26,320
elliptical galaxy but um the stars won't
 

5565
01:39:26,320 --> 01:39:27,830
elliptical galaxy but um the stars won't
be much closer together than they are

5566
01:39:27,830 --> 01:39:27,840
be much closer together than they are
 

5567
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:28,790
be much closer together than they are
now

5568
01:39:28,790 --> 01:39:28,800
now
 

5569
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:30,310
now
it'll it'll still be

5570
01:39:30,310 --> 01:39:30,320
it'll it'll still be
 

5571
01:39:30,320 --> 01:39:32,310
it'll it'll still be
just twice as many stars in the

5572
01:39:32,310 --> 01:39:32,320
just twice as many stars in the
 

5573
01:39:32,320 --> 01:39:35,350
just twice as many stars in the
structure almost as big and so um

5574
01:39:35,350 --> 01:39:35,360
structure almost as big and so um
 

5575
01:39:35,360 --> 01:39:37,750
structure almost as big and so um
the chance of another star colliding

5576
01:39:37,750 --> 01:39:37,760
the chance of another star colliding
 

5577
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:40,550
the chance of another star colliding
with our sun would still be very small

5578
01:39:40,550 --> 01:39:40,560
with our sun would still be very small
 

5579
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:42,229
with our sun would still be very small
and yeah because there's actually a lot

5580
01:39:42,229 --> 01:39:42,239
and yeah because there's actually a lot
 

5581
01:39:42,239 --> 01:39:44,550
and yeah because there's actually a lot
of space between indeed stars and

5582
01:39:44,550 --> 01:39:44,560
of space between indeed stars and
 

5583
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:46,390
of space between indeed stars and
planets yes the chance of a star getting

5584
01:39:46,390 --> 01:39:46,400
planets yes the chance of a star getting
 

5585
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:48,149
planets yes the chance of a star getting
close enough to affect our solar

5586
01:39:48,149 --> 01:39:48,159
close enough to affect our solar
 

5587
01:39:48,159 --> 01:39:50,470
close enough to affect our solar
system's orbit it's small and it won't

5588
01:39:50,470 --> 01:39:50,480
system's orbit it's small and it won't
 

5589
01:39:50,480 --> 01:39:52,149
system's orbit it's small and it won't
change that very much so

5590
01:39:52,149 --> 01:39:52,159
change that very much so
 

5591
01:39:52,159 --> 01:39:55,430
change that very much so
we could be reassured a heck of a starry

5592
01:39:55,430 --> 01:39:55,440
we could be reassured a heck of a starry
 

5593
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:57,030
we could be reassured a heck of a starry
sky though

5594
01:39:57,030 --> 01:39:57,040
sky though
 

5595
01:39:57,040 --> 01:39:58,229
sky though
what would that look well it won't make

5596
01:39:58,229 --> 01:39:58,239
what would that look well it won't make
 

5597
01:39:58,239 --> 01:39:59,510
what would that look well it won't make
much difference even to that actually

5598
01:39:59,510 --> 01:39:59,520
much difference even to that actually
 

5599
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:01,590
much difference even to that actually
it'll just be um

5600
01:40:01,590 --> 01:40:01,600
it'll just be um
 

5601
01:40:01,600 --> 01:40:02,870
it'll just be um
wouldn't that look kind of beautiful

5602
01:40:02,870 --> 01:40:02,880
wouldn't that look kind of beautiful
 

5603
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:04,390
wouldn't that look kind of beautiful
when you're swirling or is oh because

5604
01:40:04,390 --> 01:40:04,400
when you're swirling or is oh because
 

5605
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:06,709
when you're swirling or is oh because
it's scrolling so slowly yeah

5606
01:40:06,709 --> 01:40:06,719
it's scrolling so slowly yeah
 

5607
01:40:06,719 --> 01:40:08,629
it's scrolling so slowly yeah
but they're far away so we just retwise

5608
01:40:08,629 --> 01:40:08,639
but they're far away so we just retwise
 

5609
01:40:08,639 --> 01:40:11,189
but they're far away so we just retwise
as many stars in the sky yeah and but

5610
01:40:11,189 --> 01:40:11,199
as many stars in the sky yeah and but
 

5611
01:40:11,199 --> 01:40:12,870
as many stars in the sky yeah and but
the pattern changes

5612
01:40:12,870 --> 01:40:12,880
the pattern changes
 

5613
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:14,709
the pattern changes
yeah the pattern will change a bit and

5614
01:40:14,709 --> 01:40:14,719
yeah the pattern will change a bit and
 

5615
01:40:14,719 --> 01:40:16,550
yeah the pattern will change a bit and
uh there won't be the milky way because

5616
01:40:16,550 --> 01:40:16,560
uh there won't be the milky way because
 

5617
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:18,470
uh there won't be the milky way because
the milky way uh

5618
01:40:18,470 --> 01:40:18,480
the milky way uh
 

5619
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:20,229
the milky way uh
across the sky is because we are looking

5620
01:40:20,229 --> 01:40:20,239
across the sky is because we are looking
 

5621
01:40:20,239 --> 01:40:23,109
across the sky is because we are looking
in the disk of our galaxy and you lose

5622
01:40:23,109 --> 01:40:23,119
in the disk of our galaxy and you lose
 

5623
01:40:23,119 --> 01:40:23,990
in the disk of our galaxy and you lose
that

5624
01:40:23,990 --> 01:40:24,000
that
 

5625
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:25,990
that
because the um the disc will be so

5626
01:40:25,990 --> 01:40:26,000
because the um the disc will be so
 

5627
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:29,030
because the um the disc will be so
disrupted and uh it will be more so the

5628
01:40:29,030 --> 01:40:29,040
disrupted and uh it will be more so the
 

5629
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:30,550
disrupted and uh it will be more so the
spherical distribution and of course

5630
01:40:30,550 --> 01:40:30,560
spherical distribution and of course
 

5631
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:32,950
spherical distribution and of course
many galaxies are like that um and

5632
01:40:32,950 --> 01:40:32,960
many galaxies are like that um and
 

5633
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:34,310
many galaxies are like that um and
that's probably because they have been

5634
01:40:34,310 --> 01:40:34,320
that's probably because they have been
 

5635
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:36,470
that's probably because they have been
through mergers of this kind if we

5636
01:40:36,470 --> 01:40:36,480
through mergers of this kind if we
 

5637
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:38,390
through mergers of this kind if we
survive four billion years we would

5638
01:40:38,390 --> 01:40:38,400
survive four billion years we would
 

5639
01:40:38,400 --> 01:40:40,550
survive four billion years we would
likely be able to survive beyond that oh

5640
01:40:40,550 --> 01:40:40,560
likely be able to survive beyond that oh
 

5641
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:42,470
likely be able to survive beyond that oh
yeah

5642
01:40:42,470 --> 01:40:42,480
yeah
 

5643
01:40:42,480 --> 01:40:43,750
yeah
what what's the other thing on the

5644
01:40:43,750 --> 01:40:43,760
what what's the other thing on the
 

5645
01:40:43,760 --> 01:40:47,189
what what's the other thing on the
horizon for humans uh in terms of the

5646
01:40:47,189 --> 01:40:47,199
horizon for humans uh in terms of the
 

5647
01:40:47,199 --> 01:40:49,270
horizon for humans uh in terms of the
sun burning out all those kinds of

5648
01:40:49,270 --> 01:40:49,280
sun burning out all those kinds of
 

5649
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:51,910
sun burning out all those kinds of
interesting cosmological

5650
01:40:51,910 --> 01:40:51,920
interesting cosmological
 

5651
01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:53,430
interesting cosmological
threats to our

5652
01:40:53,430 --> 01:40:53,440
threats to our
 

5653
01:40:53,440 --> 01:40:55,350
threats to our
civilization well i think

5654
01:40:55,350 --> 01:40:55,360
civilization well i think
 

5655
01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:56,310
civilization well i think
on the

5656
01:40:56,310 --> 01:40:56,320
on the
 

5657
01:40:56,320 --> 01:40:57,750
on the
cosmological times together because it

5658
01:40:57,750 --> 01:40:57,760
cosmological times together because it
 

5659
01:40:57,760 --> 01:40:59,910
cosmological times together because it
won't be humans because uh

5660
01:40:59,910 --> 01:40:59,920
won't be humans because uh
 

5661
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:01,590
won't be humans because uh
something else even if evolution has

5662
01:41:01,590 --> 01:41:01,600
something else even if evolution has
 

5663
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:04,149
something else even if evolution has
gone no faster than darwinian and i

5664
01:41:04,149 --> 01:41:04,159
gone no faster than darwinian and i
 

5665
01:41:04,159 --> 01:41:05,910
gone no faster than darwinian and i
would like it will be fast and darwin in

5666
01:41:05,910 --> 01:41:05,920
would like it will be fast and darwin in
 

5667
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:08,550
would like it will be fast and darwin in
the future uh then um we're thinking

5668
01:41:08,550 --> 01:41:08,560
the future uh then um we're thinking
 

5669
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:09,669
the future uh then um we're thinking
about

5670
01:41:09,669 --> 01:41:09,679
about
 

5671
01:41:09,679 --> 01:41:12,229
about
six billion years before the sun dies so

5672
01:41:12,229 --> 01:41:12,239
six billion years before the sun dies so
 

5673
01:41:12,239 --> 01:41:14,950
six billion years before the sun dies so
any entities watching the death of the

5674
01:41:14,950 --> 01:41:14,960
any entities watching the death of the
 

5675
01:41:14,960 --> 01:41:16,950
any entities watching the death of the
sun if they're still around maybe it's

5676
01:41:16,950 --> 01:41:16,960
sun if they're still around maybe it's
 

5677
01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:19,430
sun if they're still around maybe it's
different much as we are from slime mold

5678
01:41:19,430 --> 01:41:19,440
different much as we are from slime mold
 

5679
01:41:19,440 --> 01:41:21,109
different much as we are from slime mold
or something you know

5680
01:41:21,109 --> 01:41:21,119
or something you know
 

5681
01:41:21,119 --> 01:41:23,030
or something you know
and uh far more different still if they

5682
01:41:23,030 --> 01:41:23,040
and uh far more different still if they
 

5683
01:41:23,040 --> 01:41:25,510
and uh far more different still if they
become electronic so on that time scale

5684
01:41:25,510 --> 01:41:25,520
become electronic so on that time scale
 

5685
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:27,669
become electronic so on that time scale
we just can't predict anything but i

5686
01:41:27,669 --> 01:41:27,679
we just can't predict anything but i
 

5687
01:41:27,679 --> 01:41:29,990
we just can't predict anything but i
think going back to um

5688
01:41:29,990 --> 01:41:30,000
think going back to um
 

5689
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:35,109
think going back to um
uh to the human time scale um then um uh

5690
01:41:35,109 --> 01:41:35,119
uh to the human time scale um then um uh
 

5691
01:41:35,119 --> 01:41:36,470
uh to the human time scale um then um uh
we've talked about

5692
01:41:36,470 --> 01:41:36,480
we've talked about
 

5693
01:41:36,480 --> 01:41:37,910
we've talked about
whether there'll be people on mars by

5694
01:41:37,910 --> 01:41:37,920
whether there'll be people on mars by
 

5695
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:39,510
whether there'll be people on mars by
the end of a century

5696
01:41:39,510 --> 01:41:39,520
the end of a century
 

5697
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:41,990
the end of a century
and uh even in these long perspectives

5698
01:41:41,990 --> 01:41:42,000
and uh even in these long perspectives
 

5699
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:42,870
and uh even in these long perspectives
then

5700
01:41:42,870 --> 01:41:42,880
then
 

5701
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:45,270
then
indeed this century is very special

5702
01:41:45,270 --> 01:41:45,280
indeed this century is very special
 

5703
01:41:45,280 --> 01:41:47,030
indeed this century is very special
because it may see the transition

5704
01:41:47,030 --> 01:41:47,040
because it may see the transition
 

5705
01:41:47,040 --> 01:41:49,830
because it may see the transition
between purely flesh and blood entities

5706
01:41:49,830 --> 01:41:49,840
between purely flesh and blood entities
 

5707
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:52,310
between purely flesh and blood entities
to those which are sort of cyborgs and

5708
01:41:52,310 --> 01:41:52,320
to those which are sort of cyborgs and
 

5709
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:54,550
to those which are sort of cyborgs and
that'll be a an important transition in

5710
01:41:54,550 --> 01:41:54,560
that'll be a an important transition in
 

5711
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:56,070
that'll be a an important transition in
um

5712
01:41:56,070 --> 01:41:56,080
um
 

5713
01:41:56,080 --> 01:41:56,950
um
in in

5714
01:41:56,950 --> 01:41:56,960
in in
 

5715
01:41:56,960 --> 01:41:58,870
in in
biology and complexity

5716
01:41:58,870 --> 01:41:58,880
biology and complexity
 

5717
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:00,709
biology and complexity
in this century but of course the other

5718
01:42:00,709 --> 01:42:00,719
in this century but of course the other
 

5719
01:42:00,719 --> 01:42:02,470
in this century but of course the other
importance and this has been the theme

5720
01:42:02,470 --> 01:42:02,480
importance and this has been the theme
 

5721
01:42:02,480 --> 01:42:05,510
importance and this has been the theme
of a couple of my older books is that um

5722
01:42:05,510 --> 01:42:05,520
of a couple of my older books is that um
 

5723
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:07,189
of a couple of my older books is that um
this is the first century when one

5724
01:42:07,189 --> 01:42:07,199
this is the first century when one
 

5725
01:42:07,199 --> 01:42:08,390
this is the first century when one
species

5726
01:42:08,390 --> 01:42:08,400
species
 

5727
01:42:08,400 --> 01:42:10,229
species
namely our species

5728
01:42:10,229 --> 01:42:10,239
namely our species
 

5729
01:42:10,239 --> 01:42:11,669
namely our species
has the future of the planet in his

5730
01:42:11,669 --> 01:42:11,679
has the future of the planet in his
 

5731
01:42:11,679 --> 01:42:12,709
has the future of the planet in his
hands

5732
01:42:12,709 --> 01:42:12,719
hands
 

5733
01:42:12,719 --> 01:42:14,709
hands
and that's because of

5734
01:42:14,709 --> 01:42:14,719
and that's because of
 

5735
01:42:14,719 --> 01:42:16,550
and that's because of
two types of

5736
01:42:16,550 --> 01:42:16,560
two types of
 

5737
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:17,669
two types of
concerns

5738
01:42:17,669 --> 01:42:17,679
concerns
 

5739
01:42:17,679 --> 01:42:20,229
concerns
one is that there are more of us

5740
01:42:20,229 --> 01:42:20,239
one is that there are more of us
 

5741
01:42:20,239 --> 01:42:22,390
one is that there are more of us
we're more demanding of energy and

5742
01:42:22,390 --> 01:42:22,400
we're more demanding of energy and
 

5743
01:42:22,400 --> 01:42:24,550
we're more demanding of energy and
resources and therefore we are for the

5744
01:42:24,550 --> 01:42:24,560
resources and therefore we are for the
 

5745
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:27,270
resources and therefore we are for the
first time

5746
01:42:27,270 --> 01:42:27,280
first time
 

5747
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:29,510
first time
changing the whole planet

5748
01:42:29,510 --> 01:42:29,520
changing the whole planet
 

5749
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:32,229
changing the whole planet
through um um climate change loss of

5750
01:42:32,229 --> 01:42:32,239
through um um climate change loss of
 

5751
01:42:32,239 --> 01:42:34,390
through um um climate change loss of
biodiversity and all those issues this

5752
01:42:34,390 --> 01:42:34,400
biodiversity and all those issues this
 

5753
01:42:34,400 --> 01:42:35,750
biodiversity and all those issues this
has never happened in the past because

5754
01:42:35,750 --> 01:42:35,760
has never happened in the past because
 

5755
01:42:35,760 --> 01:42:37,590
has never happened in the past because
having enough humans have been much in

5756
01:42:37,590 --> 01:42:37,600
having enough humans have been much in
 

5757
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:40,229
having enough humans have been much in
power so this is a um

5758
01:42:40,229 --> 01:42:40,239
power so this is a um
 

5759
01:42:40,239 --> 01:42:42,790
power so this is a um
an effect that's obviously is high in

5760
01:42:42,790 --> 01:42:42,800
an effect that's obviously is high in
 

5761
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:44,629
an effect that's obviously is high in
everyone's agenda now and rightly so

5762
01:42:44,629 --> 01:42:44,639
everyone's agenda now and rightly so
 

5763
01:42:44,639 --> 01:42:46,149
everyone's agenda now and rightly so
because um

5764
01:42:46,149 --> 01:42:46,159
because um
 

5765
01:42:46,159 --> 01:42:48,870
because um
we've got to ensure that we leave a

5766
01:42:48,870 --> 01:42:48,880
we've got to ensure that we leave a
 

5767
01:42:48,880 --> 01:42:51,910
we've got to ensure that we leave a
heritage that isn't eroded or damaged to

5768
01:42:51,910 --> 01:42:51,920
heritage that isn't eroded or damaged to
 

5769
01:42:51,920 --> 01:42:54,709
heritage that isn't eroded or damaged to
future generations um and so that's one

5770
01:42:54,709 --> 01:42:54,719
future generations um and so that's one
 

5771
01:42:54,719 --> 01:42:57,990
future generations um and so that's one
class of threats but there's another

5772
01:42:57,990 --> 01:42:58,000
class of threats but there's another
 

5773
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,070
class of threats but there's another
thing that worries me

5774
01:43:00,070 --> 01:43:00,080
thing that worries me
 

5775
01:43:00,080 --> 01:43:02,070
thing that worries me
perhaps more than many people seem to

5776
01:43:02,070 --> 01:43:02,080
perhaps more than many people seem to
 

5777
01:43:02,080 --> 01:43:04,229
perhaps more than many people seem to
worry and that's the

5778
01:43:04,229 --> 01:43:04,239
worry and that's the
 

5779
01:43:04,239 --> 01:43:07,430
worry and that's the
threat of misuse of technology

5780
01:43:07,430 --> 01:43:07,440
threat of misuse of technology
 

5781
01:43:07,440 --> 01:43:10,629
threat of misuse of technology
and so this is particularly because um

5782
01:43:10,629 --> 01:43:10,639
and so this is particularly because um
 

5783
01:43:10,639 --> 01:43:12,550
and so this is particularly because um
technologies

5784
01:43:12,550 --> 01:43:12,560
technologies
 

5785
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:15,270
technologies
empower even small groups

5786
01:43:15,270 --> 01:43:15,280
empower even small groups
 

5787
01:43:15,280 --> 01:43:17,910
empower even small groups
of uh malevolent people or

5788
01:43:17,910 --> 01:43:17,920
of uh malevolent people or
 

5789
01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:20,310
of uh malevolent people or
indeed even careless people

5790
01:43:20,310 --> 01:43:20,320
indeed even careless people
 

5791
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:21,669
indeed even careless people
to create

5792
01:43:21,669 --> 01:43:21,679
to create
 

5793
01:43:21,679 --> 01:43:24,390
to create
some effect which could cascade globally

5794
01:43:24,390 --> 01:43:24,400
some effect which could cascade globally
 

5795
01:43:24,400 --> 01:43:25,750
some effect which could cascade globally
and um

5796
01:43:25,750 --> 01:43:25,760
and um
 

5797
01:43:25,760 --> 01:43:29,189
and um
to take an example um a uh a dangerous

5798
01:43:29,189 --> 01:43:29,199
to take an example um a uh a dangerous
 

5799
01:43:29,199 --> 01:43:30,950
to take an example um a uh a dangerous
pathogen or pandemic

5800
01:43:30,950 --> 01:43:30,960
pathogen or pandemic
 

5801
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:34,550
pathogen or pandemic
um i mean my worst nightmare is that

5802
01:43:34,550 --> 01:43:34,560
um i mean my worst nightmare is that
 

5803
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:36,709
um i mean my worst nightmare is that
there could be

5804
01:43:36,709 --> 01:43:36,719
there could be
 

5805
01:43:36,719 --> 01:43:37,669
there could be
some

5806
01:43:37,669 --> 01:43:37,679
some
 

5807
01:43:37,679 --> 01:43:41,189
some
small group that uh can engineer a

5808
01:43:41,189 --> 01:43:41,199
small group that uh can engineer a
 

5809
01:43:41,199 --> 01:43:43,590
small group that uh can engineer a
virus to make it more virulent or more

5810
01:43:43,590 --> 01:43:43,600
virus to make it more virulent or more
 

5811
01:43:43,600 --> 01:43:46,229
virus to make it more virulent or more
transmissible than the natural virus

5812
01:43:46,229 --> 01:43:46,239
transmissible than the natural virus
 

5813
01:43:46,239 --> 01:43:47,590
transmissible than the natural virus
this is so called gain of function

5814
01:43:47,590 --> 01:43:47,600
this is so called gain of function
 

5815
01:43:47,600 --> 01:43:49,669
this is so called gain of function
experiments which were done on the flu

5816
01:43:49,669 --> 01:43:49,679
experiments which were done on the flu
 

5817
01:43:49,679 --> 01:43:51,510
experiments which were done on the flu
virus 10 years ago and can be done for

5818
01:43:51,510 --> 01:43:51,520
virus 10 years ago and can be done for
 

5819
01:43:51,520 --> 01:43:52,550
virus 10 years ago and can be done for
others

5820
01:43:52,550 --> 01:43:52,560
others
 

5821
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:56,870
others
and of course we now know from covet 19

5822
01:43:56,870 --> 01:43:56,880
and of course we now know from covet 19
 

5823
01:43:56,880 --> 01:43:58,709
and of course we now know from covet 19
that um

5824
01:43:58,709 --> 01:43:58,719
that um
 

5825
01:43:58,719 --> 01:44:01,109
that um
our world is so interconnected

5826
01:44:01,109 --> 01:44:01,119
our world is so interconnected
 

5827
01:44:01,119 --> 01:44:03,590
our world is so interconnected
that a disaster in one part of the world

5828
01:44:03,590 --> 01:44:03,600
that a disaster in one part of the world
 

5829
01:44:03,600 --> 01:44:05,350
that a disaster in one part of the world
can't be confined to that path and was

5830
01:44:05,350 --> 01:44:05,360
can't be confined to that path and was
 

5831
01:44:05,360 --> 01:44:08,470
can't be confined to that path and was
spread globally so it's possible for a

5832
01:44:08,470 --> 01:44:08,480
spread globally so it's possible for a
 

5833
01:44:08,480 --> 01:44:11,590
spread globally so it's possible for a
few dissidents with expertise in biotech

5834
01:44:11,590 --> 01:44:11,600
few dissidents with expertise in biotech
 

5835
01:44:11,600 --> 01:44:13,430
few dissidents with expertise in biotech
could create a global catastrophe of

5836
01:44:13,430 --> 01:44:13,440
could create a global catastrophe of
 

5837
01:44:13,440 --> 01:44:16,790
could create a global catastrophe of
that kind and also i think um

5838
01:44:16,790 --> 01:44:16,800
that kind and also i think um
 

5839
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:19,189
that kind and also i think um
we need to worry about very large scale

5840
01:44:19,189 --> 01:44:19,199
we need to worry about very large scale
 

5841
01:44:19,199 --> 01:44:22,709
we need to worry about very large scale

american pentagon
 

5849
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:32,629
american pentagon
about the um possibility of a state

5850
01:44:32,629 --> 01:44:32,639
about the um possibility of a state
 

5851
01:44:32,639 --> 01:44:35,430
about the um possibility of a state
level cyber attack on the electricity

5852
01:44:35,430 --> 01:44:35,440
level cyber attack on the electricity
 

5853
01:44:35,440 --> 01:44:37,990
level cyber attack on the electricity
grid in the eastern united states

5854
01:44:37,990 --> 01:44:38,000
grid in the eastern united states
 

5855
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,390
grid in the eastern united states
which is it could happen and it says at

5856
01:44:40,390 --> 01:44:40,400
which is it could happen and it says at
 

5857
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:43,270
which is it could happen and it says at
the end of this chapter that this would

5858
01:44:43,270 --> 01:44:43,280
the end of this chapter that this would
 

5859
01:44:43,280 --> 01:44:45,510
the end of this chapter that this would
merit the nuclear response

5860
01:44:45,510 --> 01:44:45,520
merit the nuclear response
 

5861
01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:47,270
merit the nuclear response
it's a pretty scary possibility that was

5862
01:44:47,270 --> 01:44:47,280
it's a pretty scary possibility that was
 

5863
01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:48,550
it's a pretty scary possibility that was
10 years ago

5864
01:44:48,550 --> 01:44:48,560
10 years ago
 

5865
01:44:48,560 --> 01:44:50,070
10 years ago
and i think now

5866
01:44:50,070 --> 01:44:50,080
and i think now
 

5867
01:44:50,080 --> 01:44:52,390
and i think now
what would have needed a state actor

5868
01:44:52,390 --> 01:44:52,400
what would have needed a state actor
 

5869
01:44:52,400 --> 01:44:53,750
what would have needed a state actor
then

5870
01:44:53,750 --> 01:44:53,760
then
 

5871
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:55,350
then
could be done perhaps by a small group

5872
01:44:55,350 --> 01:44:55,360
could be done perhaps by a small group
 

5873
01:44:55,360 --> 01:44:57,910
could be done perhaps by a small group
empowered by ai and so there's obviously

5874
01:44:57,910 --> 01:44:57,920
empowered by ai and so there's obviously
 

5875
01:44:57,920 --> 01:44:59,910
empowered by ai and so there's obviously
been a

5876
01:44:59,910 --> 01:44:59,920
been a
 

5877
01:44:59,920 --> 01:45:03,109
been a
an arms race between the uh um the cyber

5878
01:45:03,109 --> 01:45:03,119
an arms race between the uh um the cyber
 

5879
01:45:03,119 --> 01:45:05,830
an arms race between the uh um the cyber
criminals and the cyber security people

5880
01:45:05,830 --> 01:45:05,840
criminals and the cyber security people
 

5881
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:07,669
criminals and the cyber security people
luckily which side is winning but the

5882
01:45:07,669 --> 01:45:07,679
luckily which side is winning but the
 

5883
01:45:07,679 --> 01:45:10,229
luckily which side is winning but the
main point is that as we become

5884
01:45:10,229 --> 01:45:10,239
main point is that as we become
 

5885
01:45:10,239 --> 01:45:12,310
main point is that as we become
more dependent on more

5886
01:45:12,310 --> 01:45:12,320
more dependent on more
 

5887
01:45:12,320 --> 01:45:15,669
more dependent on more
integrated systems

5888
01:45:15,669 --> 01:45:15,679
integrated systems
 

5889
01:45:15,679 --> 01:45:18,470
integrated systems
uh we could get more vulnerable and uh

5890
01:45:18,470 --> 01:45:18,480
uh we could get more vulnerable and uh
 

5891
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:19,350
uh we could get more vulnerable and uh
um

5892
01:45:19,350 --> 01:45:19,360
um
 

5893
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:21,270
um
and and so we have the knowledge

5894
01:45:21,270 --> 01:45:21,280
and and so we have the knowledge
 

5895
01:45:21,280 --> 01:45:23,270
and and so we have the knowledge
then the misuse of that knowledge

5896
01:45:23,270 --> 01:45:23,280
then the misuse of that knowledge
 

5897
01:45:23,280 --> 01:45:25,669
then the misuse of that knowledge
becomes um uh more and more of a threat

5898
01:45:25,669 --> 01:45:25,679
becomes um uh more and more of a threat
 

5899
01:45:25,679 --> 01:45:29,109
becomes um uh more and more of a threat
and i say bio and cyber are the the two

5900
01:45:29,109 --> 01:45:29,119
and i say bio and cyber are the the two
 

5901
01:45:29,119 --> 01:45:32,470
and i say bio and cyber are the the two
biggest concerns um and uh if we depend

5902
01:45:32,470 --> 01:45:32,480
biggest concerns um and uh if we depend
 

5903
01:45:32,480 --> 01:45:36,310
biggest concerns um and uh if we depend
too much on ai and complex systems then

5904
01:45:36,310 --> 01:45:36,320
too much on ai and complex systems then
 

5905
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:38,790
too much on ai and complex systems then
um just breakdowns it may be that they

5906
01:45:38,790 --> 01:45:38,800
um just breakdowns it may be that they
 

5907
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:41,590
um just breakdowns it may be that they
they break down and um um even if it's

5908
01:45:41,590 --> 01:45:41,600
they break down and um um even if it's
 

5909
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:43,270
they break down and um um even if it's
an innocent breakdown then maybe pretty

5910
01:45:43,270 --> 01:45:43,280
an innocent breakdown then maybe pretty
 

5911
01:45:43,280 --> 01:45:45,270
an innocent breakdown then maybe pretty
hard to mend it and just think how much

5912
01:45:45,270 --> 01:45:45,280
hard to mend it and just think how much
 

5913
01:45:45,280 --> 01:45:47,750
hard to mend it and just think how much
worse the pandemic would have been

5914
01:45:47,750 --> 01:45:47,760
worse the pandemic would have been
 

5915
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:49,270
worse the pandemic would have been
if we'd lost the internet in the middle

5916
01:45:49,270 --> 01:45:49,280
if we'd lost the internet in the middle
 

5917
01:45:49,280 --> 01:45:50,149
if we'd lost the internet in the middle
of it

5918
01:45:50,149 --> 01:45:50,159
of it
 

5919
01:45:50,159 --> 01:45:52,629
of it
and it would be dependent more than ever

5920
01:45:52,629 --> 01:45:52,639
and it would be dependent more than ever
 

5921
01:45:52,639 --> 01:45:55,030
and it would be dependent more than ever
for communication everything else on on

5922
01:45:55,030 --> 01:45:55,040
for communication everything else on on
 

5923
01:45:55,040 --> 01:45:57,669
for communication everything else on on
on the internet and zooms and all that

5924
01:45:57,669 --> 01:45:57,679
on the internet and zooms and all that
 

5925
01:45:57,679 --> 01:45:59,910
on the internet and zooms and all that
um and if that had broken down that

5926
01:45:59,910 --> 01:45:59,920
um and if that had broken down that
 

5927
01:45:59,920 --> 01:46:01,990
um and if that had broken down that
would have made things far worse and

5928
01:46:01,990 --> 01:46:02,000
would have made things far worse and
 

5929
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:03,590
would have made things far worse and
those are the kinds of

5930
01:46:03,590 --> 01:46:03,600
those are the kinds of
 

5931
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:06,470
those are the kinds of
threats that we i think need to be more

5932
01:46:06,470 --> 01:46:06,480
threats that we i think need to be more
 

5933
01:46:06,480 --> 01:46:08,310
threats that we i think need to be more
energized and politicians need to be

5934
01:46:08,310 --> 01:46:08,320
energized and politicians need to be
 

5935
01:46:08,320 --> 01:46:11,750
energized and politicians need to be
more energized um to uh minimize and um

5936
01:46:11,750 --> 01:46:11,760
more energized um to uh minimize and um
 

5937
01:46:11,760 --> 01:46:12,790
more energized um to uh minimize and um
one of the things i've been doing the

5938
01:46:12,790 --> 01:46:12,800
one of the things i've been doing the
 

5939
01:46:12,800 --> 01:46:15,109
one of the things i've been doing the
last year um through being a member of

5940
01:46:15,109 --> 01:46:15,119
last year um through being a member of
 

5941
01:46:15,119 --> 01:46:18,390
last year um through being a member of
our part of our parliament is sort of um

5942
01:46:18,390 --> 01:46:18,400
our part of our parliament is sort of um
 

5943
01:46:18,400 --> 01:46:20,550
our part of our parliament is sort of um
i have to instigate a committee to think

5944
01:46:20,550 --> 01:46:20,560
i have to instigate a committee to think
 

5945
01:46:20,560 --> 01:46:23,750
i have to instigate a committee to think
more on better preparedness for

5946
01:46:23,750 --> 01:46:23,760
more on better preparedness for
 

5947
01:46:23,760 --> 01:46:25,430
more on better preparedness for
extreme technological risks and things

5948
01:46:25,430 --> 01:46:25,440
extreme technological risks and things
 

5949
01:46:25,440 --> 01:46:28,470
extreme technological risks and things
like that so they're a big concern in my

5950
01:46:28,470 --> 01:46:28,480
like that so they're a big concern in my
 

5951
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:31,030
like that so they're a big concern in my
my mind that uh we've got to make sure

5952
01:46:31,030 --> 01:46:31,040
my mind that uh we've got to make sure
 

5953
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:35,430
my mind that uh we've got to make sure
that we um can benefit from these um

5954
01:46:35,430 --> 01:46:35,440
that we um can benefit from these um
 

5955
01:46:35,440 --> 01:46:39,270
that we um can benefit from these um
advances um but safely because

5956
01:46:39,270 --> 01:46:39,280
advances um but safely because
 

5957
01:46:39,280 --> 01:46:41,030
advances um but safely because
the states are getting higher you know

5958
01:46:41,030 --> 01:46:41,040
the states are getting higher you know
 

5959
01:46:41,040 --> 01:46:42,550
the states are getting higher you know
the benefits are getting great as we

5960
01:46:42,550 --> 01:46:42,560
the benefits are getting great as we
 

5961
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:45,270
the benefits are getting great as we
know huge benefits from computers but

5962
01:46:45,270 --> 01:46:45,280
know huge benefits from computers but
 

5963
01:46:45,280 --> 01:46:47,750
know huge benefits from computers but
but also huge downsides as well

5964
01:46:47,750 --> 01:46:47,760
but also huge downsides as well
 

5965
01:46:47,760 --> 01:46:50,070
but also huge downsides as well
and one of the things this war

5966
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:50,080
and one of the things this war
 

5967
01:46:50,080 --> 01:46:52,550
and one of the things this war
in ukraine has shown

5968
01:46:52,550 --> 01:46:52,560
in ukraine has shown
 

5969
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:54,950
in ukraine has shown
one of the most terrifying things

5970
01:46:54,950 --> 01:46:54,960
one of the most terrifying things
 

5971
01:46:54,960 --> 01:46:58,229
one of the most terrifying things
outside of the humanitarian crisis

5972
01:46:58,229 --> 01:46:58,239
outside of the humanitarian crisis
 

5973
01:46:58,239 --> 01:47:03,830
outside of the humanitarian crisis
is that at least for me i realized

5974
01:47:03,830 --> 01:47:03,840

 

5975
01:47:03,840 --> 01:47:06,470

that the human capacity to initiate

5976
01:47:06,470 --> 01:47:06,480
that the human capacity to initiate
 

5977
01:47:06,480 --> 01:47:08,629
that the human capacity to initiate
nuclear war

5978
01:47:08,629 --> 01:47:08,639
nuclear war
 

5979
01:47:08,639 --> 01:47:09,669
nuclear war
is

5980
01:47:09,669 --> 01:47:09,679
is
 

5981
01:47:09,679 --> 01:47:11,669
is
greater than i thought

5982
01:47:11,669 --> 01:47:11,679
greater than i thought
 

5983
01:47:11,679 --> 01:47:13,590
greater than i thought
i thought the lessons of the past have

5984
01:47:13,590 --> 01:47:13,600
i thought the lessons of the past have
 

5985
01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:15,270
i thought the lessons of the past have
been learned

5986
01:47:15,270 --> 01:47:15,280
been learned
 

5987
01:47:15,280 --> 01:47:17,669
been learned
it seems that we hang on the brink of

5988
01:47:17,669 --> 01:47:17,679
it seems that we hang on the brink of
 

5989
01:47:17,679 --> 01:47:19,030
it seems that we hang on the brink of
nuclear war

5990
01:47:19,030 --> 01:47:19,040
nuclear war
 

5991
01:47:19,040 --> 01:47:22,390
nuclear war
with this conflict like every single day

5992
01:47:22,390 --> 01:47:22,400
with this conflict like every single day
 

5993
01:47:22,400 --> 01:47:23,990
with this conflict like every single day
with just one

5994
01:47:23,990 --> 01:47:24,000
with just one
 

5995
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:25,350
with just one
mistake

5996
01:47:25,350 --> 01:47:25,360
mistake
 

5997
01:47:25,360 --> 01:47:27,590
mistake
or bad actor

5998
01:47:27,590 --> 01:47:27,600
or bad actor
 

5999
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:28,950
or bad actor
or

6000
01:47:28,950 --> 01:47:28,960
or
 

6001
01:47:28,960 --> 01:47:31,430
or
the actual leaders of the particular

6002
01:47:31,430 --> 01:47:31,440
the actual leaders of the particular
 

6003
01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:33,910
the actual leaders of the particular
nations launching a nuclear strike and

6004
01:47:33,910 --> 01:47:33,920
nations launching a nuclear strike and
 

6005
01:47:33,920 --> 01:47:36,070
nations launching a nuclear strike and
all hell broke breaks loose

6006
01:47:36,070 --> 01:47:36,080
all hell broke breaks loose
 

6007
01:47:36,080 --> 01:47:37,350
all hell broke breaks loose
so then

6008
01:47:37,350 --> 01:47:37,360
so then
 

6009
01:47:37,360 --> 01:47:39,189
so then
adding to that picture cyber attacks and

6010
01:47:39,189 --> 01:47:39,199
adding to that picture cyber attacks and
 

6011
01:47:39,199 --> 01:47:40,870
adding to that picture cyber attacks and
so on that can

6012
01:47:40,870 --> 01:47:40,880
so on that can
 

6013
01:47:40,880 --> 01:47:44,229
so on that can
lead to to confusion and chaos and then

6014
01:47:44,229 --> 01:47:44,239
lead to to confusion and chaos and then
 

6015
01:47:44,239 --> 01:47:46,149
lead to to confusion and chaos and then
out of that confusion

6016
01:47:46,149 --> 01:47:46,159
out of that confusion
 

6017
01:47:46,159 --> 01:47:47,590
out of that confusion
um

6018
01:47:47,590 --> 01:47:47,600
um
 

6019
01:47:47,600 --> 01:47:50,470
um
calculations are made such that uh a

6020
01:47:50,470 --> 01:47:50,480
calculations are made such that uh a
 

6021
01:47:50,480 --> 01:47:53,669
calculations are made such that uh a
nuclear launch is

6022
01:47:53,669 --> 01:47:53,679

 

6023
01:47:53,679 --> 01:47:56,390

a nuclear weapon is launched and it's

6024
01:47:56,390 --> 01:47:56,400
a nuclear weapon is launched and it's
 

6025
01:47:56,400 --> 01:47:59,350
a nuclear weapon is launched and it's
and then you're talking about

6026
01:47:59,350 --> 01:47:59,360
and then you're talking about
 

6027
01:47:59,360 --> 01:48:02,629
and then you're talking about
i mean i don't it directs probably 60 70

6028
01:48:02,629 --> 01:48:02,639
i mean i don't it directs probably 60 70
 

6029
01:48:02,639 --> 01:48:03,750
i mean i don't it directs probably 60 70
percent

6030
01:48:03,750 --> 01:48:03,760
percent
 

6031
01:48:03,760 --> 01:48:06,550
percent
of humans on earth are dead instantly

6032
01:48:06,550 --> 01:48:06,560
of humans on earth are dead instantly
 

6033
01:48:06,560 --> 01:48:09,430
of humans on earth are dead instantly
and then the rest

6034
01:48:09,430 --> 01:48:09,440
and then the rest
 

6035
01:48:09,440 --> 01:48:12,070
and then the rest
i mean it's uh basically 99 percent of

6036
01:48:12,070 --> 01:48:12,080
i mean it's uh basically 99 percent of
 

6037
01:48:12,080 --> 01:48:13,910
i mean it's uh basically 99 percent of
the human population is wiped out in the

6038
01:48:13,910 --> 01:48:13,920
the human population is wiped out in the
 

6039
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:16,070
the human population is wiped out in the
period of well five years that's that

6040
01:48:16,070 --> 01:48:16,080
period of well five years that's that
 

6041
01:48:16,080 --> 01:48:18,790
period of well five years that's that
was real devastation for civilization of

6042
01:48:18,790 --> 01:48:18,800
was real devastation for civilization of
 

6043
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:20,870
was real devastation for civilization of
course and of course we're quite right

6044
01:48:20,870 --> 01:48:20,880
course and of course we're quite right
 

6045
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:23,430
course and of course we're quite right
that this could happen very quickly um

6046
01:48:23,430 --> 01:48:23,440
that this could happen very quickly um
 

6047
01:48:23,440 --> 01:48:25,270
that this could happen very quickly um
because of uh um

6048
01:48:25,270 --> 01:48:25,280
because of uh um
 

6049
01:48:25,280 --> 01:48:26,229
because of uh um
you know

6050
01:48:26,229 --> 01:48:26,239
you know
 

6051
01:48:26,239 --> 01:48:28,470
you know
information coming in and there's a

6052
01:48:28,470 --> 01:48:28,480
information coming in and there's a
 

6053
01:48:28,480 --> 01:48:31,510
information coming in and there's a
there's hardly enough time for human

6054
01:48:31,510 --> 01:48:31,520
there's hardly enough time for human
 

6055
01:48:31,520 --> 01:48:33,510
there's hardly enough time for human
um collected and

6056
01:48:33,510 --> 01:48:33,520
um collected and
 

6057
01:48:33,520 --> 01:48:35,910
um collected and
careful thought and there had have been

6058
01:48:35,910 --> 01:48:35,920
careful thought and there had have been
 

6059
01:48:35,920 --> 01:48:38,950
careful thought and there had have been
uh recorded cases of false alarms

6060
01:48:38,950 --> 01:48:38,960
uh recorded cases of false alarms
 

6061
01:48:38,960 --> 01:48:40,870
uh recorded cases of false alarms
several where um

6062
01:48:40,870 --> 01:48:40,880
several where um
 

6063
01:48:40,880 --> 01:48:42,870
several where um
where there have been suspected um

6064
01:48:42,870 --> 01:48:42,880
where there have been suspected um
 

6065
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:45,590
where there have been suspected um
attacks from the other side and

6066
01:48:45,590 --> 01:48:45,600
attacks from the other side and
 

6067
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:47,510
attacks from the other side and
fortunately they've been realized to be

6068
01:48:47,510 --> 01:48:47,520
fortunately they've been realized to be
 

6069
01:48:47,520 --> 01:48:49,510
fortunately they've been realized to be
false alarm soon enough but but this

6070
01:48:49,510 --> 01:48:49,520
false alarm soon enough but but this
 

6071
01:48:49,520 --> 01:48:51,590
false alarm soon enough but but this
could happen and there's a new class of

6072
01:48:51,590 --> 01:48:51,600
could happen and there's a new class of
 

6073
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:53,109
could happen and there's a new class of
threats actually which

6074
01:48:53,109 --> 01:48:53,119
threats actually which
 

6075
01:48:53,119 --> 01:48:54,709
threats actually which
in our center in cambridge people are

6076
01:48:54,709 --> 01:48:54,719
in our center in cambridge people are
 

6077
01:48:54,719 --> 01:48:58,390
in our center in cambridge people are
thinking about which is that um

6078
01:48:58,390 --> 01:48:58,400
thinking about which is that um
 

6079
01:48:58,400 --> 01:49:01,350
thinking about which is that um
the commander control system

6080
01:49:01,350 --> 01:49:01,360
the commander control system
 

6081
01:49:01,360 --> 01:49:02,550
the commander control system
of

6082
01:49:02,550 --> 01:49:02,560
of
 

6083
01:49:02,560 --> 01:49:03,990
of
the nuclear

6084
01:49:03,990 --> 01:49:04,000
the nuclear
 

6085
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,070
the nuclear
weapons and the submarine fleet and all

6086
01:49:06,070 --> 01:49:06,080
weapons and the submarine fleet and all
 

6087
01:49:06,080 --> 01:49:09,350
weapons and the submarine fleet and all
that um is now more automated and uh

6088
01:49:09,350 --> 01:49:09,360
that um is now more automated and uh
 

6089
01:49:09,360 --> 01:49:11,669
that um is now more automated and uh
could be subject to cyber attacks and

6090
01:49:11,669 --> 01:49:11,679
could be subject to cyber attacks and
 

6091
01:49:11,679 --> 01:49:14,149
could be subject to cyber attacks and
that's a new threat which didn't exist

6092
01:49:14,149 --> 01:49:14,159
that's a new threat which didn't exist
 

6093
01:49:14,159 --> 01:49:17,750
that's a new threat which didn't exist
um 30 years ago and so um i think

6094
01:49:17,750 --> 01:49:17,760
um 30 years ago and so um i think
 

6095
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:20,790
um 30 years ago and so um i think
indeed it it's it's we're in a sort of

6096
01:49:20,790 --> 01:49:20,800
indeed it it's it's we're in a sort of
 

6097
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:23,430
indeed it it's it's we're in a sort of
scary world i think

6098
01:49:23,430 --> 01:49:23,440
scary world i think
 

6099
01:49:23,440 --> 01:49:24,390
scary world i think
and uh

6100
01:49:24,390 --> 01:49:24,400
and uh
 

6101
01:49:24,400 --> 01:49:27,030
and uh
it's because things happen faster

6102
01:49:27,030 --> 01:49:27,040
it's because things happen faster
 

6103
01:49:27,040 --> 01:49:29,430
it's because things happen faster
and human beings aren't in such direct

6104
01:49:29,430 --> 01:49:29,440
and human beings aren't in such direct
 

6105
01:49:29,440 --> 01:49:31,430
and human beings aren't in such direct
and immediate control because someone is

6106
01:49:31,430 --> 01:49:31,440
and immediate control because someone is
 

6107
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:34,229
and immediate control because someone is
delegated to machines um and also

6108
01:49:34,229 --> 01:49:34,239
delegated to machines um and also
 

6109
01:49:34,239 --> 01:49:35,750
delegated to machines um and also
because the world is so much more

6110
01:49:35,750 --> 01:49:35,760
because the world is so much more
 

6111
01:49:35,760 --> 01:49:37,350
because the world is so much more
interconnected

6112
01:49:37,350 --> 01:49:37,360
interconnected
 

6113
01:49:37,360 --> 01:49:38,470
interconnected
then

6114
01:49:38,470 --> 01:49:38,480
then
 

6115
01:49:38,480 --> 01:49:39,669
then
some

6116
01:49:39,669 --> 01:49:39,679
some
 

6117
01:49:39,679 --> 01:49:42,629
some
local event can cascade globally

6118
01:49:42,629 --> 01:49:42,639
local event can cascade globally
 

6119
01:49:42,639 --> 01:49:44,310
local event can cascade globally
in a way it never could in the past and

6120
01:49:44,310 --> 01:49:44,320
in a way it never could in the past and
 

6121
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:45,750
in a way it never could in the past and
much faster

6122
01:49:45,750 --> 01:49:45,760
much faster
 

6123
01:49:45,760 --> 01:49:47,510
much faster
yeah it's a double-edged sword because

6124
01:49:47,510 --> 01:49:47,520
yeah it's a double-edged sword because
 

6125
01:49:47,520 --> 01:49:50,149
yeah it's a double-edged sword because
the interco interconnectedness

6126
01:49:50,149 --> 01:49:50,159
the interco interconnectedness
 

6127
01:49:50,159 --> 01:49:53,430
the interco interconnectedness
brings

6128
01:49:53,430 --> 01:49:53,440

 

6129
01:49:53,440 --> 01:49:56,149

brings a higher quality of life across a

6130
01:49:56,149 --> 01:49:56,159
brings a higher quality of life across a
 

6131
01:49:56,159 --> 01:49:58,470
brings a higher quality of life across a
lot of metrics yeah it can do but of

6132
01:49:58,470 --> 01:49:58,480
lot of metrics yeah it can do but of
 

6133
01:49:58,480 --> 01:50:00,950
lot of metrics yeah it can do but of
course there again i mean if you think

6134
01:50:00,950 --> 01:50:00,960
course there again i mean if you think
 

6135
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:03,189
course there again i mean if you think
of supply chains where we get stuff from

6136
01:50:03,189 --> 01:50:03,199
of supply chains where we get stuff from
 

6137
01:50:03,199 --> 01:50:05,589
of supply chains where we get stuff from
around the world and um one lesson we've

6138
01:50:05,589 --> 01:50:05,599
around the world and um one lesson we've
 

6139
01:50:05,599 --> 01:50:06,870
around the world and um one lesson we've
learned is that there's a trade-off

6140
01:50:06,870 --> 01:50:06,880
learned is that there's a trade-off
 

6141
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:09,750
learned is that there's a trade-off
between resilience and efficiency and

6142
01:50:09,750 --> 01:50:09,760
between resilience and efficiency and
 

6143
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:12,310
between resilience and efficiency and
it's resilient

6144
01:50:12,310 --> 01:50:12,320
it's resilient
 

6145
01:50:12,320 --> 01:50:13,830
it's resilient
to have

6146
01:50:13,830 --> 01:50:13,840
to have
 

6147
01:50:13,840 --> 01:50:16,470
to have
an inventory in stock and to depend on

6148
01:50:16,470 --> 01:50:16,480
an inventory in stock and to depend on
 

6149
01:50:16,480 --> 01:50:18,950
an inventory in stock and to depend on
local supplies where it's more efficient

6150
01:50:18,950 --> 01:50:18,960
local supplies where it's more efficient
 

6151
01:50:18,960 --> 01:50:20,070
local supplies where it's more efficient
to have

6152
01:50:20,070 --> 01:50:20,080
to have
 

6153
01:50:20,080 --> 01:50:21,990
to have
a long supply chain

6154
01:50:21,990 --> 01:50:22,000
a long supply chain
 

6155
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:23,030
a long supply chain
but the

6156
01:50:23,030 --> 01:50:23,040
but the
 

6157
01:50:23,040 --> 01:50:25,270
but the
risk there is that a

6158
01:50:25,270 --> 01:50:25,280
risk there is that a
 

6159
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:28,149
risk there is that a
break in one link in one chain

6160
01:50:28,149 --> 01:50:28,159
break in one link in one chain
 

6161
01:50:28,159 --> 01:50:29,830
break in one link in one chain
can screw up car production this has

6162
01:50:29,830 --> 01:50:29,840
can screw up car production this has
 

6163
01:50:29,840 --> 01:50:31,750
can screw up car production this has
already happened in the pandemic so so

6164
01:50:31,750 --> 01:50:31,760
already happened in the pandemic so so
 

6165
01:50:31,760 --> 01:50:33,910
already happened in the pandemic so so
there's a trade-off and there are

6166
01:50:33,910 --> 01:50:33,920
there's a trade-off and there are
 

6167
01:50:33,920 --> 01:50:35,669
there's a trade-off and there are
examples i mean for instance the other

6168
01:50:35,669 --> 01:50:35,679
examples i mean for instance the other
 

6169
01:50:35,679 --> 01:50:38,709
examples i mean for instance the other
thing we learned was that uh it may be

6170
01:50:38,709 --> 01:50:38,719
thing we learned was that uh it may be
 

6171
01:50:38,719 --> 01:50:41,189
thing we learned was that uh it may be
efficient to have 95 percent of your

6172
01:50:41,189 --> 01:50:41,199
efficient to have 95 percent of your
 

6173
01:50:41,199 --> 01:50:43,030
efficient to have 95 percent of your
hospital intensive care beds occupied

6174
01:50:43,030 --> 01:50:43,040
hospital intensive care beds occupied
 

6175
01:50:43,040 --> 01:50:45,030
hospital intensive care beds occupied
all the time which would be in the uk

6176
01:50:45,030 --> 01:50:45,040
all the time which would be in the uk
 

6177
01:50:45,040 --> 01:50:47,189
all the time which would be in the uk
situation whereas to do what the germans

6178
01:50:47,189 --> 01:50:47,199
situation whereas to do what the germans
 

6179
01:50:47,199 --> 01:50:49,669
situation whereas to do what the germans
do and always keep 20 of them free for

6180
01:50:49,669 --> 01:50:49,679
do and always keep 20 of them free for
 

6181
01:50:49,679 --> 01:50:51,990
do and always keep 20 of them free for
an emergency is really a sense of a

6182
01:50:51,990 --> 01:50:52,000
an emergency is really a sense of a
 

6183
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:55,109
an emergency is really a sense of a
precaution and so i think um

6184
01:50:55,109 --> 01:50:55,119
precaution and so i think um
 

6185
01:50:55,119 --> 01:50:56,950
precaution and so i think um
we've probably learned a lot of lessons

6186
01:50:56,950 --> 01:50:56,960
we've probably learned a lot of lessons
 

6187
01:50:56,960 --> 01:51:00,790
we've probably learned a lot of lessons
from kobit 19 and they would include um

6188
01:51:00,790 --> 01:51:00,800
from kobit 19 and they would include um
 

6189
01:51:00,800 --> 01:51:02,870
from kobit 19 and they would include um
rebalancing the trade-off between

6190
01:51:02,870 --> 01:51:02,880
rebalancing the trade-off between
 

6191
01:51:02,880 --> 01:51:04,390
rebalancing the trade-off between
resilience

6192
01:51:04,390 --> 01:51:04,400
resilience
 

6193
01:51:04,400 --> 01:51:06,470
resilience
and efficiency

6194
01:51:06,470 --> 01:51:06,480
and efficiency
 

6195
01:51:06,480 --> 01:51:09,270
and efficiency
boy the the fact that coven 19 a

6196
01:51:09,270 --> 01:51:09,280
boy the the fact that coven 19 a
 

6197
01:51:09,280 --> 01:51:11,189
boy the the fact that coven 19 a
pandemic that could have been a lot a

6198
01:51:11,189 --> 01:51:11,199
pandemic that could have been a lot a
 

6199
01:51:11,199 --> 01:51:12,790
pandemic that could have been a lot a
lot worse

6200
01:51:12,790 --> 01:51:12,800
lot worse
 

6201
01:51:12,800 --> 01:51:15,270
lot worse
brought the world to its knees anyway

6202
01:51:15,270 --> 01:51:15,280
brought the world to its knees anyway
 

6203
01:51:15,280 --> 01:51:17,750
brought the world to its knees anyway
it could be far worse in terms of its uh

6204
01:51:17,750 --> 01:51:17,760
it could be far worse in terms of its uh
 

6205
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:20,790
it could be far worse in terms of its uh
fatality rate or fatality right yeah

6206
01:51:20,790 --> 01:51:20,800
fatality rate or fatality right yeah
 

6207
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:23,510
fatality rate or fatality right yeah
so the fact that that i mean it revealed

6208
01:51:23,510 --> 01:51:23,520
so the fact that that i mean it revealed
 

6209
01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:26,229
so the fact that that i mean it revealed
so many flaws in our human institutions

6210
01:51:26,229 --> 01:51:26,239
so many flaws in our human institutions
 

6211
01:51:26,239 --> 01:51:27,669
so many flaws in our human institutions
yeah yeah

6212
01:51:27,669 --> 01:51:27,679
yeah yeah
 

6213
01:51:27,679 --> 01:51:29,669
yeah yeah
yes and i think you know i'm rather

6214
01:51:29,669 --> 01:51:29,679
yes and i think you know i'm rather
 

6215
01:51:29,679 --> 01:51:33,510
yes and i think you know i'm rather
pessimistic because um

6216
01:51:33,510 --> 01:51:33,520

 

6217
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:36,229

uh i do worry about the uh

6218
01:51:36,229 --> 01:51:36,239
uh i do worry about the uh
 

6219
01:51:36,239 --> 01:51:37,030
uh i do worry about the uh
the

6220
01:51:37,030 --> 01:51:37,040
the
 

6221
01:51:37,040 --> 01:51:39,990
the
bad actual a small group who can produce

6222
01:51:39,990 --> 01:51:40,000
bad actual a small group who can produce
 

6223
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:43,350
bad actual a small group who can produce
catastrophe um and um uh uh if you

6224
01:51:43,350 --> 01:51:43,360
catastrophe um and um uh uh if you
 

6225
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:45,030
catastrophe um and um uh uh if you
imagine someone

6226
01:51:45,030 --> 01:51:45,040
imagine someone
 

6227
01:51:45,040 --> 01:51:46,550
imagine someone
with access to the kind of equipment

6228
01:51:46,550 --> 01:51:46,560
with access to the kind of equipment
 

6229
01:51:46,560 --> 01:51:48,310
with access to the kind of equipment
that's available in university labs or

6230
01:51:48,310 --> 01:51:48,320
that's available in university labs or
 

6231
01:51:48,320 --> 01:51:51,109
that's available in university labs or
industrial labs and they could create

6232
01:51:51,109 --> 01:51:51,119
industrial labs and they could create
 

6233
01:51:51,119 --> 01:51:54,870
industrial labs and they could create
some dangerous pathogen um then even one

6234
01:51:54,870 --> 01:51:54,880
some dangerous pathogen um then even one
 

6235
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:57,109
some dangerous pathogen um then even one
such person is too many

6236
01:51:57,109 --> 01:51:57,119
such person is too many
 

6237
01:51:57,119 --> 01:51:59,350
such person is too many
and how can we stop that because uh

6238
01:51:59,350 --> 01:51:59,360
and how can we stop that because uh
 

6239
01:51:59,360 --> 01:52:01,430
and how can we stop that because uh
it's true that you can

6240
01:52:01,430 --> 01:52:01,440
it's true that you can
 

6241
01:52:01,440 --> 01:52:03,350
it's true that you can
have regulations i mean academies are

6242
01:52:03,350 --> 01:52:03,360
have regulations i mean academies are
 

6243
01:52:03,360 --> 01:52:05,589
have regulations i mean academies are
having meetings etc about

6244
01:52:05,589 --> 01:52:05,599
having meetings etc about
 

6245
01:52:05,599 --> 01:52:08,629
having meetings etc about
how to regulate these new biological

6246
01:52:08,629 --> 01:52:08,639
how to regulate these new biological
 

6247
01:52:08,639 --> 01:52:11,030
how to regulate these new biological
experiments etc make them safe but even

6248
01:52:11,030 --> 01:52:11,040
experiments etc make them safe but even
 

6249
01:52:11,040 --> 01:52:13,270
experiments etc make them safe but even
if you have all these regulations

6250
01:52:13,270 --> 01:52:13,280
if you have all these regulations
 

6251
01:52:13,280 --> 01:52:16,390
if you have all these regulations
then enforcing regulations

6252
01:52:16,390 --> 01:52:16,400
then enforcing regulations
 

6253
01:52:16,400 --> 01:52:18,550
then enforcing regulations
is yeah pretty hopeless we can't enforce

6254
01:52:18,550 --> 01:52:18,560
is yeah pretty hopeless we can't enforce
 

6255
01:52:18,560 --> 01:52:21,270
is yeah pretty hopeless we can't enforce
the tax laws globally we can't enforce

6256
01:52:21,270 --> 01:52:21,280
the tax laws globally we can't enforce
 

6257
01:52:21,280 --> 01:52:24,149
the tax laws globally we can't enforce
the drug laws globally and so similarly

6258
01:52:24,149 --> 01:52:24,159
the drug laws globally and so similarly
 

6259
01:52:24,159 --> 01:52:27,270
the drug laws globally and so similarly
we can't readily enforce the um

6260
01:52:27,270 --> 01:52:27,280
we can't readily enforce the um
 

6261
01:52:27,280 --> 01:52:29,430
we can't readily enforce the um
laws against people doing these danish

6262
01:52:29,430 --> 01:52:29,440
laws against people doing these danish
 

6263
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:30,470
laws against people doing these danish
experiments

6264
01:52:30,470 --> 01:52:30,480
experiments
 

6265
01:52:30,480 --> 01:52:32,470
experiments
even if all the governments say they

6266
01:52:32,470 --> 01:52:32,480
even if all the governments say they
 

6267
01:52:32,480 --> 01:52:35,510
even if all the governments say they
should be prohibited and so my my line

6268
01:52:35,510 --> 01:52:35,520
should be prohibited and so my my line
 

6269
01:52:35,520 --> 01:52:36,950
should be prohibited and so my my line
on this is that

6270
01:52:36,950 --> 01:52:36,960
on this is that
 

6271
01:52:36,960 --> 01:52:37,910
on this is that
uh

6272
01:52:37,910 --> 01:52:37,920
uh
 

6273
01:52:37,920 --> 01:52:39,350
uh
all nations are going to face a big

6274
01:52:39,350 --> 01:52:39,360
all nations are going to face a big
 

6275
01:52:39,360 --> 01:52:42,070
all nations are going to face a big
trade-off between three things we value

6276
01:52:42,070 --> 01:52:42,080
trade-off between three things we value
 

6277
01:52:42,080 --> 01:52:42,870
trade-off between three things we value
um

6278
01:52:42,870 --> 01:52:42,880
um
 

6279
01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:44,390
um
freedom

6280
01:52:44,390 --> 01:52:44,400
freedom
 

6281
01:52:44,400 --> 01:52:47,510
freedom
security and privacy

6282
01:52:47,510 --> 01:52:47,520
security and privacy
 

6283
01:52:47,520 --> 01:52:49,750
security and privacy
and i think uh um

6284
01:52:49,750 --> 01:52:49,760
and i think uh um
 

6285
01:52:49,760 --> 01:52:51,430
and i think uh um
different nations will

6286
01:52:51,430 --> 01:52:51,440
different nations will
 

6287
01:52:51,440 --> 01:52:54,470
different nations will
uh make that choice differently um the

6288
01:52:54,470 --> 01:52:54,480
uh make that choice differently um the
 

6289
01:52:54,480 --> 01:52:55,589
uh make that choice differently um the
chinese

6290
01:52:55,589 --> 01:52:55,599
chinese
 

6291
01:52:55,599 --> 01:52:56,830
chinese
would give a

6292
01:52:56,830 --> 01:52:56,840
would give a
 

6293
01:52:56,840 --> 01:52:59,430
would give a
privacy and have more certainly more

6294
01:52:59,430 --> 01:52:59,440
privacy and have more certainly more
 

6295
01:52:59,440 --> 01:53:02,229
privacy and have more certainly more
security if not more liberty um but i

6296
01:53:02,229 --> 01:53:02,239
security if not more liberty um but i
 

6297
01:53:02,239 --> 01:53:04,310
security if not more liberty um but i
think uh um

6298
01:53:04,310 --> 01:53:04,320
think uh um
 

6299
01:53:04,320 --> 01:53:05,430
think uh um
in

6300
01:53:05,430 --> 01:53:05,440
in
 

6301
01:53:05,440 --> 01:53:07,910
in
in our countries um i think we're going

6302
01:53:07,910 --> 01:53:07,920
in our countries um i think we're going
 

6303
01:53:07,920 --> 01:53:10,390
in our countries um i think we're going
to have to give up more privacy

6304
01:53:10,390 --> 01:53:10,400
to have to give up more privacy
 

6305
01:53:10,400 --> 01:53:12,149
to have to give up more privacy
in the same way that's a really

6306
01:53:12,149 --> 01:53:12,159
in the same way that's a really
 

6307
01:53:12,159 --> 01:53:14,790
in the same way that's a really
interesting trade-off um but

6308
01:53:14,790 --> 01:53:14,800
interesting trade-off um but
 

6309
01:53:14,800 --> 01:53:16,550
interesting trade-off um but
there's also something about human

6310
01:53:16,550 --> 01:53:16,560
there's also something about human
 

6311
01:53:16,560 --> 01:53:18,229
there's also something about human
nature here where

6312
01:53:18,229 --> 01:53:18,239
nature here where
 

6313
01:53:18,239 --> 01:53:20,229
nature here where
i personally believe that all humans are

6314
01:53:20,229 --> 01:53:20,239
i personally believe that all humans are
 

6315
01:53:20,239 --> 01:53:22,550
i personally believe that all humans are
capable of good and evil

6316
01:53:22,550 --> 01:53:22,560
capable of good and evil
 

6317
01:53:22,560 --> 01:53:24,629
capable of good and evil
and there's some aspect to which we can

6318
01:53:24,629 --> 01:53:24,639
and there's some aspect to which we can
 

6319
01:53:24,639 --> 01:53:25,750
and there's some aspect to which we can
fight

6320
01:53:25,750 --> 01:53:25,760
fight
 

6321
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:28,870
fight
this by encouraging

6322
01:53:28,870 --> 01:53:28,880
this by encouraging
 

6323
01:53:28,880 --> 01:53:30,390
this by encouraging
people

6324
01:53:30,390 --> 01:53:30,400
people
 

6325
01:53:30,400 --> 01:53:33,510
people
incentivizing people towards the better

6326
01:53:33,510 --> 01:53:33,520
incentivizing people towards the better
 

6327
01:53:33,520 --> 01:53:35,510
incentivizing people towards the better
angels of their nature

6328
01:53:35,510 --> 01:53:35,520
angels of their nature
 

6329
01:53:35,520 --> 01:53:36,550
angels of their nature
so

6330
01:53:36,550 --> 01:53:36,560
so
 

6331
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:38,390
so
in order for a small group of people to

6332
01:53:38,390 --> 01:53:38,400
in order for a small group of people to
 

6333
01:53:38,400 --> 01:53:41,669
in order for a small group of people to
create to engineer deadly pathogens

6334
01:53:41,669 --> 01:53:41,679
create to engineer deadly pathogens
 

6335
01:53:41,679 --> 01:53:44,550
create to engineer deadly pathogens
you have to have people

01:56:46,800 --> 01:56:48,070
that could have been done to improve
people's

6496
01:56:48,070 --> 01:56:48,080
people's
 

6497
01:56:48,080 --> 01:56:50,229
people's
lot in life because of lack of knowledge

6498
01:56:50,229 --> 01:56:50,239
lot in life because of lack of knowledge
 

6499
01:56:50,239 --> 01:56:52,870
lot in life because of lack of knowledge
and lack of science etc um so the gap

6500
01:56:52,870 --> 01:56:52,880
and lack of science etc um so the gap
 

6501
01:56:52,880 --> 01:56:55,189
and lack of science etc um so the gap
between the way the world was

6502
01:56:55,189 --> 01:56:55,199
between the way the world was
 

6503
01:56:55,199 --> 01:56:56,790
between the way the world was
which is pretty miserable and the way

6504
01:56:56,790 --> 01:56:56,800
which is pretty miserable and the way
 

6505
01:56:56,800 --> 01:56:58,550
which is pretty miserable and the way
the world could have been

6506
01:56:58,550 --> 01:56:58,560
the world could have been
 

6507
01:56:58,560 --> 01:57:00,310
the world could have been
which wasn't all that much better it was

6508
01:57:00,310 --> 01:57:00,320
which wasn't all that much better it was
 

6509
01:57:00,320 --> 01:57:01,589
which wasn't all that much better it was
fairly narrow

6510
01:57:01,589 --> 01:57:01,599
fairly narrow
 

6511
01:57:01,599 --> 01:57:03,109
fairly narrow
whereas now

6512
01:57:03,109 --> 01:57:03,119
whereas now
 

6513
01:57:03,119 --> 01:57:04,790
whereas now
the gap between the way the world is and

6514
01:57:04,790 --> 01:57:04,800
the gap between the way the world is and
 

6515
01:57:04,800 --> 01:57:06,470
the gap between the way the world is and
the way the world could be

6516
01:57:06,470 --> 01:57:06,480
the way the world could be
 

6517
01:57:06,480 --> 01:57:08,790
the way the world could be
is far far wider

6518
01:57:08,790 --> 01:57:08,800
is far far wider
 

6519
01:57:08,800 --> 01:57:10,790
is far far wider
and therefore i think we are ethically

6520
01:57:10,790 --> 01:57:10,800
and therefore i think we are ethically
 

6521
01:57:10,800 --> 01:57:11,830
and therefore i think we are ethically
um

6522
01:57:11,830 --> 01:57:11,840
um
 

6523
01:57:11,840 --> 01:57:14,709
um
more uh um at fault

6524
01:57:14,709 --> 01:57:14,719
more uh um at fault
 

6525
01:57:14,719 --> 01:57:16,790
more uh um at fault
uh in allowing this gap to get wider

6526
01:57:16,790 --> 01:57:16,800
uh in allowing this gap to get wider
 

6527
01:57:16,800 --> 01:57:19,669
uh in allowing this gap to get wider
than it was in medieval times and so i i

6528
01:57:19,669 --> 01:57:19,679
than it was in medieval times and so i i
 

6529
01:57:19,679 --> 01:57:22,390
than it was in medieval times and so i i
would very much question and dispute the

6530
01:57:22,390 --> 01:57:22,400
would very much question and dispute the
 

6531
01:57:22,400 --> 01:57:25,589
would very much question and dispute the
idea that we are um ethically um in

6532
01:57:25,589 --> 01:57:25,599
idea that we are um ethically um in
 

6533
01:57:25,599 --> 01:57:27,510
idea that we are um ethically um in
advance of our predecessors that's

6534
01:57:27,510 --> 01:57:27,520
advance of our predecessors that's
 

6535
01:57:27,520 --> 01:57:28,790
advance of our predecessors that's
collectively a lot of interesting

6536
01:57:28,790 --> 01:57:28,800
collectively a lot of interesting
 

6537
01:57:28,800 --> 01:57:31,189
collectively a lot of interesting
hypotheses in there and i don't

6538
01:57:31,189 --> 01:57:31,199
hypotheses in there and i don't
 

6539
01:57:31,199 --> 01:57:33,270
hypotheses in there and i don't
they're it's a it's a fascinating

6540
01:57:33,270 --> 01:57:33,280
they're it's a it's a fascinating
 

6541
01:57:33,280 --> 01:57:35,430
they're it's a it's a fascinating
question of how much

6542
01:57:35,430 --> 01:57:35,440
question of how much
 

6543
01:57:35,440 --> 01:57:37,589
question of how much
is the size of that gap between the way

6544
01:57:37,589 --> 01:57:37,599
is the size of that gap between the way
 

6545
01:57:37,599 --> 01:57:39,270
is the size of that gap between the way
the world is and the way the world could

6546
01:57:39,270 --> 01:57:39,280
the world is and the way the world could
 

6547
01:57:39,280 --> 01:57:41,830
the world is and the way the world could
be is a reflection of our ethics or

6548
01:57:41,830 --> 01:57:41,840
be is a reflection of our ethics or
 

6549
01:57:41,840 --> 01:57:43,910
be is a reflection of our ethics or
maybe sometimes it's just a reflection

6550
01:57:43,910 --> 01:57:43,920
maybe sometimes it's just a reflection
 

6551
01:57:43,920 --> 01:57:46,070
maybe sometimes it's just a reflection
of a very large number of people

6552
01:57:46,070 --> 01:57:46,080
of a very large number of people
 

6553
01:57:46,080 --> 01:57:48,629
of a very large number of people
uh like maybe it's a a technical

6554
01:57:48,629 --> 01:57:48,639
uh like maybe it's a a technical
 

6555
01:57:48,639 --> 01:57:50,790
uh like maybe it's a a technical
challenge too it's not just well about

6556
01:57:50,790 --> 01:57:50,800
challenge too it's not just well about
 

6557
01:57:50,800 --> 01:57:52,870
challenge too it's not just well about
political systems political systems like

6558
01:57:52,870 --> 01:57:52,880
political systems political systems like
 

6559
01:57:52,880 --> 01:57:53,990
political systems political systems like
how many

6560
01:57:53,990 --> 01:57:54,000
how many
 

6561
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:55,350
how many
and we're trying to figure this thing

6562
01:57:55,350 --> 01:57:55,360
and we're trying to figure this thing
 

6563
01:57:55,360 --> 01:57:57,830
and we're trying to figure this thing
out like there's 20th century

6564
01:57:57,830 --> 01:57:57,840
out like there's 20th century
 

6565
01:57:57,840 --> 01:57:59,669
out like there's 20th century
tried this thing that sounded really

6566
01:57:59,669 --> 01:57:59,679
tried this thing that sounded really
 

6567
01:57:59,679 --> 01:58:01,270
tried this thing that sounded really
good on paper

6568
01:58:01,270 --> 01:58:01,280
good on paper
 

6569
01:58:01,280 --> 01:58:03,510
good on paper
of collective the communism type of

6570
01:58:03,510 --> 01:58:03,520
of collective the communism type of
 

6571
01:58:03,520 --> 01:58:04,629
of collective the communism type of
things

6572
01:58:04,629 --> 01:58:04,639
things
 

6573
01:58:04,639 --> 01:58:06,470
things
and it's like turned out at least the

6574
01:58:06,470 --> 01:58:06,480
and it's like turned out at least the
 

6575
01:58:06,480 --> 01:58:08,550
and it's like turned out at least the
way that was done there

6576
01:58:08,550 --> 01:58:08,560
way that was done there
 

6577
01:58:08,560 --> 01:58:10,550
way that was done there
at least atrocities and the suffering

6578
01:58:10,550 --> 01:58:10,560
at least atrocities and the suffering
 

6579
01:58:10,560 --> 01:58:12,709
at least atrocities and the suffering
and the murder of tens of millions of

6580
01:58:12,709 --> 01:58:12,719
and the murder of tens of millions of
 

6581
01:58:12,719 --> 01:58:14,790
and the murder of tens of millions of
people okay so that didn't work let's

6582
01:58:14,790 --> 01:58:14,800
people okay so that didn't work let's
 

6583
01:58:14,800 --> 01:58:16,390
people okay so that didn't work let's
try democracy

6584
01:58:16,390 --> 01:58:16,400
try democracy
 

6585
01:58:16,400 --> 01:58:18,629
try democracy
and that seems to have a lot of flaws

6586
01:58:18,629 --> 01:58:18,639
and that seems to have a lot of flaws
 

6587
01:58:18,639 --> 01:58:20,310
and that seems to have a lot of flaws
but it seems to be the best thing we've

6588
01:58:20,310 --> 01:58:20,320
but it seems to be the best thing we've
 

6589
01:58:20,320 --> 01:58:21,669
but it seems to be the best thing we've
got so far so we're trying to figure

6590
01:58:21,669 --> 01:58:21,679
got so far so we're trying to figure
 

6591
01:58:21,679 --> 01:58:24,070
got so far so we're trying to figure
this out as our technologies become more

6592
01:58:24,070 --> 01:58:24,080
this out as our technologies become more
 

6593
01:58:24,080 --> 01:58:26,470
this out as our technologies become more
and more powerful have the capacity to

6594
01:58:26,470 --> 01:58:26,480
and more powerful have the capacity to
 

6595
01:58:26,480 --> 01:58:28,629
and more powerful have the capacity to
do a lot of good to the world but also

6596
01:58:28,629 --> 01:58:28,639
do a lot of good to the world but also
 

6597
01:58:28,639 --> 01:58:30,310
do a lot of good to the world but also
unfortunately have the capacity to

6598
01:58:30,310 --> 01:58:30,320
unfortunately have the capacity to
 

6599
01:58:30,320 --> 01:58:32,470
unfortunately have the capacity to
destroy the entirety of the human

6600
01:58:32,470 --> 01:58:32,480
destroy the entirety of the human
 

6601
01:58:32,480 --> 01:58:34,229
destroy the entirety of the human
civilization and i think it's social

6602
01:58:34,229 --> 01:58:34,239
civilization and i think it's social
 

6603
01:58:34,239 --> 01:58:35,750
civilization and i think it's social
media generally

6604
01:58:35,750 --> 01:58:35,760
media generally
 

6605
01:58:35,760 --> 01:58:37,109

which

6606
01:58:37,109 --> 01:58:37,119

makes it

01:58:38,070 --> 01:58:38,080
makes it
 

6609
01:58:38,080 --> 01:58:40,070
makes it
harder to get a

6610
01:58:40,070 --> 01:58:40,080
harder to get a
 

6611
01:58:40,080 --> 01:58:42,390
harder to get a
a sort of moderate consensus because in

6612
01:58:42,390 --> 01:58:42,400
a sort of moderate consensus because in
 

6613
01:58:42,400 --> 01:58:44,790
a sort of moderate consensus because in
the old days when people got their

01:58:44,790 --> 01:58:44,800
the old days when people got their

filtered through responsible journalists
in this country the bbc and they made

6620
01:58:49,830 --> 01:58:49,840
in this country the bbc and they made
 

6621
01:58:49,840 --> 01:58:52,870
in this country the bbc and they made
newspapers etc and they would muffle the

6622
01:58:52,870 --> 01:58:52,880
newspapers etc and they would muffle the
 

6623
01:58:52,880 --> 01:58:56,229
newspapers etc and they would muffle the
crazy extremes whereas now of course um

6624
01:58:56,229 --> 01:58:56,239
crazy extremes whereas now of course um
 

6625
01:58:56,239 --> 01:58:58,629
crazy extremes whereas now of course um
they're there on the internet and if you

6626
01:58:58,629 --> 01:58:58,639
they're there on the internet and if you
 

6627
01:58:58,639 --> 01:59:00,070
they're there on the internet and if you
click on them you get to understand more

6628
01:59:00,070 --> 01:59:00,080
click on them you get to understand more
 

6629
01:59:00,080 --> 01:59:02,629
click on them you get to understand more
extreme and so i think we are

6630
01:59:02,629 --> 01:59:02,639
extreme and so i think we are
 

6631
01:59:02,639 --> 01:59:05,109
extreme and so i think we are
seeing a sort of dangerous polarization

6632
01:59:05,109 --> 01:59:05,119
seeing a sort of dangerous polarization
 

6633
01:59:05,119 --> 01:59:06,149
seeing a sort of dangerous polarization
which i think is going to make all

6634
01:59:06,149 --> 01:59:06,159
which i think is going to make all
 

6635
01:59:06,159 --> 01:59:08,070
which i think is going to make all
countries harder to govern and not

6636
01:59:08,070 --> 01:59:08,080
countries harder to govern and not
 

6637
01:59:08,080 --> 01:59:10,550

01:59:26,550 --> 01:59:26,560
it's not like they're creating it
 

6657
01:59:26,560 --> 01:59:28,950
it's not like they're creating it
they're revealing it in part

6658
01:59:28,950 --> 01:59:28,960
they're revealing it in part
 

6659
01:59:28,960 --> 01:59:30,950
they're revealing it in part
and so that puts a lot of

6660
01:59:30,950 --> 01:59:30,960
and so that puts a lot of
 

6661
01:59:30,960 --> 01:59:32,390
and so that puts a lot of
uh

6662
01:59:32,390 --> 01:59:32,400
uh
 

6663
01:59:32,400 --> 01:59:34,550
uh
that puts the responsibility into the

6664
01:59:34,550 --> 01:59:34,560
that puts the responsibility into the
 

6665
01:59:34,560 --> 01:59:36,229
that puts the responsibility into the
hands of social media and the

6666
01:59:36,229 --> 01:59:36,239
hands of social media and the
 

6667
01:59:36,239 --> 01:59:38,470
hands of social media and the
opportunity in the hands of social media

6668
01:59:38,470 --> 01:59:38,480
opportunity in the hands of social media
 

6669
01:59:38,480 --> 01:59:41,189
opportunity in the hands of social media
to alleviate some of that division so it

6670
01:59:41,189 --> 01:59:41,199
to alleviate some of that division so it
 

6671
01:59:41,199 --> 01:59:43,830
to alleviate some of that division so it
could in the long arc of human history

6672
01:59:43,830 --> 01:59:43,840
could in the long arc of human history
 

6673
01:59:43,840 --> 01:59:46,629
could in the long arc of human history
result so bringing some of those

6674
01:59:46,629 --> 01:59:46,639
result so bringing some of those
 

6675
01:59:46,639 --> 01:59:49,510
result so bringing some of those
divisions and the anger and the hatred

6676
01:59:49,510 --> 01:59:49,520
divisions and the anger and the hatred
 

6677
01:59:49,520 --> 01:59:51,990
divisions and the anger and the hatred
to the surface so that we can talk about

6678
01:59:51,990 --> 01:59:52,000
to the surface so that we can talk about
 

6679
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,629
to the surface so that we can talk about
it and as opposed to disproportionately

6680
01:59:54,629 --> 01:59:54,639
it and as opposed to disproportionately
 

6681
01:59:54,639 --> 01:59:56,950
it and as opposed to disproportionately
promoting it actually just surfacing it

6682
01:59:56,950 --> 01:59:56,960
promoting it actually just surfacing it
 

6683
01:59:56,960 --> 01:59:58,470
promoting it actually just surfacing it
so we can get over well you're assuming

6684
01:59:58,470 --> 01:59:58,480
so we can get over well you're assuming
 

6685
01:59:58,480 --> 02:00:00,870
so we can get over well you're assuming
that the uh the fat cats are more public

6686
02:00:00,870 --> 02:00:00,880
that the uh the fat cats are more public
 

6687

02:00:04,310 --> 02:00:04,320
not sure about that
 

6691
02:00:04,320 --> 02:00:06,310
not sure about that
i think there's a lot of money to be

6692
02:00:06,310 --> 02:00:06,320
i think there's a lot of money to be
 

6693
02:00:06,320 --> 02:00:08,149
i think there's a lot of money to be
made in being

6713
02:00:25,679 --> 02:00:28,310
i think
that may be true but i just personally

6714
02:00:28,310 --> 02:00:28,320
that may be true but i just personally
 

6715

believe people being happy
 

6717
02:00:31,760 --> 02:00:34,229
believe people being happy
is a hell of a good business model

6718
02:00:34,229 --> 02:00:34,239
is a hell of a good business model
 

6719
02:00:34,239 --> 02:00:35,830
is a hell of a good business model
and so making

6720
02:00:35,830 --> 02:00:35,840
and so making
 

6721
02:00:35,840 --> 02:00:37,669
and so making
as many people happy

6722
02:00:37,669 --> 02:00:37,679
as many people happy

helping them flourish in a long-term way
 

6725
02:00:39,679 --> 02:00:41,270
helping them flourish in a long-term way
that's a lot of way to make people

on the other hand i think guilt and

6730
02:00:44,550 --> 02:00:44,560
on the other hand i think guilt and
 

6731
02:00:44,560 --> 02:00:46,550
on the other hand i think guilt and
shame are good motives to make you

6732
02:00:46,550 --> 02:00:46,560
shame are good motives to make you
 

6733
02:00:46,560 --> 02:00:48,470
shame are good motives to make you
behave better in future okay so that's

6734
02:00:48,470 --> 02:00:48,480
behave better in future okay so that's
 

6735
02:00:48,480 --> 02:00:50,050
behave better in future okay so that's
my experience

6736
02:00:50,050 --> 02:00:50,060
my experience
 

6737
02:00:50,060 --> 02:00:51,510
my experience
[Laughter]

6738
02:00:51,510 --> 02:00:51,520
[Laughter]
 

6739
02:00:51,520 --> 02:00:53,430
[Laughter]
from maybe in the political perspective

6740
02:00:53,430 --> 02:00:53,440
from maybe in the political perspective
 

6741
02:00:53,440 --> 02:00:55,830
from maybe in the political perspective
of certainness in case yeah but it does

6742
02:00:55,830 --> 02:00:55,840
of certainness in case yeah but it does
 

6743
02:00:55,840 --> 02:00:57,669
of certainness in case yeah but it does
make sense now that we can destroy

6744
02:00:57,669 --> 02:00:57,679
make sense now that we can destroy
 

6745
02:00:57,679 --> 02:01:00,310
make sense now that we can destroy
ourselves with nuclear weapons with

6746
02:01:00,310 --> 02:01:00,320
ourselves with nuclear weapons with
 

6747
02:01:00,320 --> 02:01:03,030
ourselves with nuclear weapons with
engineered pandemics and so on

6748
02:01:03,030 --> 02:01:03,040
engineered pandemics and so on
 

6749
02:01:03,040 --> 02:01:05,669
engineered pandemics and so on
that the aliens would show up

6750
02:01:05,669 --> 02:01:05,679
that the aliens would show up
 

6751
02:01:05,679 --> 02:01:06,709
that the aliens would show up
that

6752
02:01:06,709 --> 02:01:06,719
that
 

6753
02:01:06,719 --> 02:01:08,550
that
like if i was

6754
02:01:08,550 --> 02:01:08,560
like if i was
 

6755
02:01:08,560 --> 02:01:09,510
like if i was
the

6756
02:01:09,510 --> 02:01:09,520
the
 

6757
02:01:09,520 --> 02:01:13,669
the
um you know had a leadership position

6758
02:01:13,669 --> 02:01:13,679
um you know had a leadership position
 

6759
02:01:13,679 --> 02:01:16,390
um you know had a leadership position
maybe as a scientist or otherwise in an

6760
02:01:16,390 --> 02:01:16,400
maybe as a scientist or otherwise in an
 

6761
02:01:16,400 --> 02:01:18,310
maybe as a scientist or otherwise in an
alien civilization

6762
02:01:18,310 --> 02:01:18,320
alien civilization
 

6763
02:01:18,320 --> 02:01:20,709
alien civilization
and i would come upon earth

6764
02:01:20,709 --> 02:01:20,719
and i would come upon earth
 

6765
02:01:20,719 --> 02:01:25,350
and i would come upon earth
i would try to watch from a distance

6766
02:01:25,350 --> 02:01:25,360
i would try to watch from a distance
 

6767
02:01:25,360 --> 02:01:27,189
i would try to watch from a distance
do not interfere

6768
02:01:27,189 --> 02:01:27,199
do not interfere
 

6769
02:01:27,199 --> 02:01:29,830
do not interfere
and i would start interfering

6770
02:01:29,830 --> 02:01:29,840
and i would start interfering
 

6771
02:01:29,840 --> 02:01:33,030
and i would start interfering
when these life forms start becoming

6772
02:01:33,030 --> 02:01:33,040
when these life forms start becoming
 

6773
02:01:33,040 --> 02:01:35,189
when these life forms start becoming
quite they have the capacity to be

6774
02:01:35,189 --> 02:01:35,199
quite they have the capacity to be
 

6775
02:01:35,199 --> 02:01:36,709
quite they have the capacity to be
destructive

6776
02:01:36,709 --> 02:01:36,719
destructive
 

6777
02:01:36,719 --> 02:01:37,669
destructive
and so

6778
02:01:37,669 --> 02:01:37,679
and so
 

6779
02:01:37,679 --> 02:01:39,270
and so
i mean it's a it is an interesting

6780
02:01:39,270 --> 02:01:39,280
i mean it's a it is an interesting
 

6781
02:01:39,280 --> 02:01:40,709
i mean it's a it is an interesting
question when people talk about your

6782
02:01:40,709 --> 02:01:40,719
question when people talk about your
 

6783
02:01:40,719 --> 02:01:42,229
question when people talk about your
full sightings on all those kinds of

6784
02:01:42,229 --> 02:01:42,239
full sightings on all those kinds of
 

6785
02:01:42,239 --> 02:01:43,589
full sightings on all those kinds of
things

6786
02:01:43,589 --> 02:01:43,599
things
 

6787
02:01:43,599 --> 02:01:45,430
things
that at least these are benign aliens

6788
02:01:45,430 --> 02:01:45,440
that at least these are benign aliens
 

6789
02:01:45,440 --> 02:01:46,629
that at least these are benign aliens
you're thinking

6790
02:01:46,629 --> 02:01:46,639
you're thinking
 

6791
02:01:46,639 --> 02:01:49,270
you're thinking
benign yes i mean they

6792
02:01:49,270 --> 02:01:49,280

6795
02:01:54,159 --> 02:01:56,310

partially as with all curiosity

6796
02:01:56,310 --> 02:01:56,320
partially as with all curiosity
 

6797
02:01:56,320 --> 02:01:58,550
partially as with all curiosity
partially selfish to try to observe is

6798
02:01:58,550 --> 02:01:58,560
partially selfish to try to observe is
 

6799
02:01:58,560 --> 02:02:00,550
partially selfish to try to observe is
there something interesting about this

6800
02:02:00,550 --> 02:02:00,560
there something interesting about this
 

6801
02:02:00,560 --> 02:02:03,109
there something interesting about this
particular evolutionary system

6802
02:02:03,109 --> 02:02:03,119
particular evolutionary system
 

6803
02:02:03,119 --> 02:02:05,910
particular evolutionary system
um because i'm sure even to aliens earth

6804
02:02:05,910 --> 02:02:05,920
um because i'm sure even to aliens earth
 

6805
02:02:05,920 --> 02:02:07,990
um because i'm sure even to aliens earth
is a curiosity yeah

6806
02:02:07,990 --> 02:02:08,000
is a curiosity yeah
 

6807
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:09,750
is a curiosity yeah
but it's in this very special

6808
02:02:09,750 --> 02:02:09,760
but it's in this very special
 

6809
02:02:09,760 --> 02:02:10,709
but it's in this very special
stage

6810
02:02:10,709 --> 02:02:10,719
stage
 

6811
02:02:10,719 --> 02:02:12,790
stage
in this question especially perhaps this

6812
02:02:12,790 --> 02:02:12,800
in this question especially perhaps this
 

6813
02:02:12,800 --> 02:02:15,510
in this question especially perhaps this
century is very special yes among the 45

6814
02:02:15,510 --> 02:02:15,520
century is very special yes among the 45
 

6815
02:02:15,520 --> 02:02:17,270
century is very special yes among the 45
million centuries the earth experienced

6816
02:02:17,270 --> 02:02:17,280
million centuries the earth experienced
 

6817
02:02:17,280 --> 02:02:19,270
million centuries the earth experienced
already so it is a very special time

6818
02:02:19,270 --> 02:02:19,280
already so it is a very special time
 

6819
02:02:19,280 --> 02:02:20,709
already so it is a very special time

02:08:11,910 --> 02:08:11,920
about offering any any wisdom but uh
 

7145
02:08:11,920 --> 02:08:12,870
about offering any any wisdom but uh
i think

7146
02:08:12,870 --> 02:08:12,880
i think
 

7147
02:08:12,880 --> 02:08:14,069
i think
i think

7148
02:08:14,069 --> 02:08:14,079
i think
 

7149
02:08:14,079 --> 02:08:15,270
i think
they they should

7150
02:08:15,270 --> 02:08:15,280
they they should
 

7151
02:08:15,280 --> 02:08:19,189
they they should
they should realize that um uh um

7152
02:08:19,189 --> 02:08:19,199
they should realize that um uh um
 

7153
02:08:19,199 --> 02:08:20,550
they should realize that um uh um
the choices

7154
02:08:20,550 --> 02:08:20,560
the choices
 

7155
02:08:20,560 --> 02:08:21,669
the choices
they make

7156
02:08:21,669 --> 02:08:21,679
they make
 

7157
02:08:21,679 --> 02:08:25,430
they make
at that time are um important and um

7158
02:08:25,430 --> 02:08:25,440
at that time are um important and um
 

7159
02:08:25,440 --> 02:08:27,430
at that time are um important and um
from the experience of

7160
02:08:27,430 --> 02:08:27,440
from the experience of
 

7161
02:08:27,440 --> 02:08:29,750
from the experience of
i've had and with many friends um many

7162
02:08:29,750 --> 02:08:29,760
i've had and with many friends um many
 

7163
02:08:29,760 --> 02:08:31,750
i've had and with many friends um many
people don't realize that opportunities

7164
02:08:31,750 --> 02:08:31,760
people don't realize that opportunities
 

7165
02:08:31,760 --> 02:08:32,790
people don't realize that opportunities
open

7166
02:08:32,790 --> 02:08:32,800
open
 

7167
02:08:32,800 --> 02:08:34,629
open
until it's too late

7168
02:08:34,629 --> 02:08:34,639
until it's too late
 

7169
02:08:34,639 --> 02:08:35,750
until it's too late
they somehow think that some

7170
02:08:35,750 --> 02:08:35,760
they somehow think that some
 

7171
02:08:35,760 --> 02:08:37,109
they somehow think that some
opportunities are only open to a few

7172
02:08:37,109 --> 02:08:37,119
opportunities are only open to a few
 

7173
02:08:37,119 --> 02:08:38,470
opportunities are only open to a few
privileged people

7174
02:08:38,470 --> 02:08:38,480
privileged people
 

7175
02:08:38,480 --> 02:08:40,629
privileged people
and they don't even try and then that

7176
02:08:40,629 --> 02:08:40,639
and they don't even try and then that
 

7177
02:08:40,639 --> 02:08:43,350
and they don't even try and then that
they could succeed um but um

7178
02:08:43,350 --> 02:08:43,360
they could succeed um but um
 

7179
02:08:43,360 --> 02:08:45,430
they could succeed um but um
if i focus on people

7180
02:08:45,430 --> 02:08:45,440
if i focus on people
 

7181
02:08:45,440 --> 02:08:47,589
if i focus on people
working in um

7182
02:08:47,589 --> 02:08:47,599
working in um
 

7183
02:08:47,599 --> 02:08:49,589
working in um
some profession i know about like

7184
02:08:49,589 --> 02:08:49,599
some profession i know about like
 

7185
02:08:49,599 --> 02:08:52,390
some profession i know about like
science i would say

7186
02:08:52,390 --> 02:08:52,400
science i would say
 

7187
02:08:52,400 --> 02:08:54,629
science i would say
pick an area to work in

7188
02:08:54,629 --> 02:08:54,639
pick an area to work in
 

7189
02:08:54,639 --> 02:08:57,030
pick an area to work in
where new things are happening

7190
02:08:57,030 --> 02:08:57,040
where new things are happening
 

7191
02:08:57,040 --> 02:08:59,270
where new things are happening
uh where uh you can

7192
02:08:59,270 --> 02:08:59,280
uh where uh you can
 

7193
02:08:59,280 --> 02:09:01,270
uh where uh you can
do something that the old guys never had

7194
02:09:01,270 --> 02:09:01,280
do something that the old guys never had
 

7195
02:09:01,280 --> 02:09:03,350
do something that the old guys never had
a chance to think about

7196
02:09:03,350 --> 02:09:03,360
a chance to think about
 

7197
02:09:03,360 --> 02:09:05,189
a chance to think about
don't go into a field that's fairly

7198
02:09:05,189 --> 02:09:05,199
don't go into a field that's fairly
 

7199
02:09:05,199 --> 02:09:07,589
don't go into a field that's fairly
stagnant because then um there will be

7200
02:09:07,589 --> 02:09:07,599
stagnant because then um there will be
 

7201
02:09:07,599 --> 02:09:09,910
stagnant because then um there will be
much to do or you'll be trying to tackle

7202
02:09:09,910 --> 02:09:09,920
much to do or you'll be trying to tackle
 

7203
02:09:09,920 --> 02:09:11,589
much to do or you'll be trying to tackle
the problems that the old guys got stuck

7204
02:09:11,589 --> 02:09:11,599
the problems that the old guys got stuck
 

7205
02:09:11,599 --> 02:09:14,790
the problems that the old guys got stuck
on and so i think in science um i can

7206
02:09:14,790 --> 02:09:14,800
on and so i think in science um i can
 

7207
02:09:14,800 --> 02:09:16,830
on and so i think in science um i can
give people good advice that they should

7208
02:09:16,830 --> 02:09:16,840
give people good advice that they should
 

7209
02:09:16,840 --> 02:09:19,750
give people good advice that they should
um pick a subject where there are

7210
02:09:19,750 --> 02:09:19,760
um pick a subject where there are
 

7211
02:09:19,760 --> 02:09:22,149
um pick a subject where there are
exciting new developments and also of

02:09:22,149 --> 02:09:22,159
exciting new developments and also of
 

7213
02:09:22,159 --> 02:09:24,149
exciting new developments and also of
course something which uh suits their

7214
02:09:24,149 --> 02:09:24,159
course something which uh suits their
 

7215
02:09:24,159 --> 02:09:26,229
course something which uh suits their
style because even within science which

7216
02:09:26,229 --> 02:09:26,239
style because even within science which
 

7217
02:09:26,239 --> 02:09:28,310
style because even within science which
is just one profession um there's a big

7218
02:09:28,310 --> 02:09:28,320
is just one profession um there's a big
 

7219
02:09:28,320 --> 02:09:30,069
is just one profession um there's a big
range of style between the sort of

work the person who works in a big team
 

7225
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:37,510
work the person who works in a big team
etc and whether you like computing or

7226
02:09:37,510 --> 02:09:37,520
etc and whether you like computing or
 

7227
02:09:37,520 --> 02:09:40,950
etc and whether you like computing or
mathematical thought etc so pick some

7228
02:09:40,950 --> 02:09:40,960

opportunity throughout like you said go
 

7239
02:09:52,320 --> 02:09:54,550
opportunity throughout like you said go
to a new field go to a field where new

students but i think most of us and i

7246
02:10:00,709 --> 02:10:00,719
students but i think most of us and i
 

7247
02:10:00,719 --> 02:10:02,790
students but i think most of us and i
include myself in this didn't realize

7248
02:10:02,790 --> 02:10:02,800
include myself in this didn't realize
 

7249
02:10:02,800 --> 02:10:06,709
include myself in this didn't realize
this sort of thing as too late

yeah i think this applies way beyond
 

7253
02:10:08,480 --> 02:10:11,350
yeah i think this applies way beyond

and to have been fairly lucky in um
 

7273
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,229
and to have been fairly lucky in um
in my life in many respects compared to

7274

in my life in many respects compared to
 

7275
02:10:34,239 --> 02:10:37,030
in my life in many respects compared to
to most people so i feel very fortunate

7276

this reminds me of this
 

7281
02:10:40,880 --> 02:10:42,390
this reminds me of this

emphasis on uh living much longer than
 

7285
02:10:45,119 --> 02:10:47,830
emphasis on uh living much longer than
the so-called altos laboratories

7286
02:10:47,830 --> 02:10:47,840
the so-called altos laboratories
 

7287
02:10:47,840 --> 02:10:49,589
the so-called altos laboratories
which have been set up by

which have been set up by
 

7289
02:10:49,599 --> 02:10:51,430
which have been set up by
billionaires

billionaires
 

7291
02:10:51,440 --> 02:10:52,709
billionaires
there's one in

7292
02:10:52,709 --> 02:10:52,719
there's one in
 

7293
02:10:52,719 --> 02:10:55,430
there's one in
san francisco one in
