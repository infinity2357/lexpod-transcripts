in your lifetime will we be able to
 

49
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,830
in your lifetime will we be able to

00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:09,200
further question is
 

63
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,550
further question is
are we close

64
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:10,560
are we close
 

65
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,230
are we close
will we be able to build a system that

66
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:12,240
will we be able to build a system that
 

67
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,750
will we be able to build a system that
replaces you

68

conversation how far away are we do you

74
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:19,200
conversation how far away are we do you
 

75
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,390

think it's a good question um i think

76
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:22,400
think it's a good question um i think
 

77
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,270
think it's a good question um i think
partly i would say do we want that i

78
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:25,280
partly i would say do we want that i
 

79
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,990
partly i would say do we want that i
i really like when we start now with

80
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:28,000
i really like when we start now with
 

81
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,069
i really like when we start now with
very powerful models interacting with

82
00:01:30,069 --> 00:01:30,079
very powerful models interacting with
 

83
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:30,870
very powerful models interacting with
them

84
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:30,880
them
 

85
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,910
them
and thinking of them more closer to us

86
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:33,920
and thinking of them more closer to us
 

87
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,550
and thinking of them more closer to us
the question is if you remove the human

88
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:36,560
the question is if you remove the human
 

89
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,830
the question is if you remove the human
side of the conversation is that an

90
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:38,840
side of the conversation is that an
 

91
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,550
side of the conversation is that an
interesting you know is that an

92
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:40,560
interesting you know is that an
 

93
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,190
interesting you know is that an
interesting artifact and i would say

94
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:43,200
interesting artifact and i would say
 

95
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,389
interesting artifact and i would say
probably not i've seen for instance um

96
00:01:46,389 --> 00:01:46,399
probably not i've seen for instance um
 

97
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,069
probably not i've seen for instance um
last time we spoke like was we were

98
00:01:48,069 --> 00:01:48,079
last time we spoke like was we were
 

99
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,510
last time we spoke like was we were
talking about starcraft um and creating

100
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:51,520
talking about starcraft um and creating
 

101
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,910
talking about starcraft um and creating
you know agents that play games involves

102
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:53,920
you know agents that play games involves
 

103
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,990
you know agents that play games involves
self-play but ultimately what people

104
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:56,000
self-play but ultimately what people
 

105
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,510
self-play but ultimately what people
care about was

106
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:57,520
care about was
 

107
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,670
care about was
how does this agent behave when the

108
00:01:59,670 --> 00:01:59,680
how does this agent behave when the
 

109
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,630
how does this agent behave when the
opposite side is is a human

110
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:02,640
opposite side is is a human
 

111
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,749
opposite side is is a human
so

112
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:03,759
so
 

113
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,389
so
without a doubt we will probably be more

114
00:02:06,389 --> 00:02:06,399
without a doubt we will probably be more
 

115
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,150
without a doubt we will probably be more
empowered by ai um maybe you can

116
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:10,160
empowered by ai um maybe you can
 

117
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,309
empowered by ai um maybe you can
source some questions from an ai system

118
00:02:12,309 --> 00:02:12,319
source some questions from an ai system
 

119
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,150
source some questions from an ai system
i mean that even today i would say it's

120
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:14,160
i mean that even today i would say it's
 

121
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,830
i mean that even today i would say it's
quite plausible that with your

00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:15,840
quite plausible that with your
 

123
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,229
quite plausible that with your
creativity you might actually find very

124
00:02:18,229 --> 00:02:18,239
creativity you might actually find very
 

125
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,750
creativity you might actually find very
interesting questions that you can

126
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:19,760
interesting questions that you can

from this answer i like the words chosen

from this answer i like the words chosen

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,350
from this answer i like the words chosen
by this particular system that created a

not exactly exciting to me um although

not exactly exciting to me um although
 

147
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,470
not exactly exciting to me um although
in my lifetime i think way i mean given

148
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:44,480
in my lifetime i think way i mean given
 

149
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,710

00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:46,720
the trajectory i think it's possible
 

151
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,430
the trajectory i think it's possible
that perhaps there could be interesting

152
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:49,440
that perhaps there could be interesting
 

153
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,070
that perhaps there could be interesting
um maybe self-play interviews as you

154
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:52,080
um maybe self-play interviews as you
 

155
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,229
um maybe self-play interviews as you
you're suggesting that would look look

156
00:02:54,229 --> 00:02:54,239
you're suggesting that would look look
 

157
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,550
you're suggesting that would look look
or sound kind of quite interesting and

00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:56,560
or sound kind of quite interesting and
 

159
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,390
or sound kind of quite interesting and
probably would advocate or you could

160
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:58,400
probably would advocate or you could
 

161
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,470
probably would advocate or you could
learn a topic through listening to one

of these interviews at a basic level at
 

165
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,070
of these interviews at a basic level at

least so you said it doesn't seem
 

167
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,910

00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:07,760
part of the objective function the thing
 

171
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,670
part of the objective function the thing
is optimized over so you can there's

172
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:09,680
is optimized over so you can there's
 

173
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,830
is optimized over so you can there's
probably a huge amount of data

174
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:11,840
probably a huge amount of data
 

175
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,070
probably a huge amount of data
of humans if you look correctly of

00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:14,080
of humans if you look correctly of
 

177
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,390
of humans if you look correctly of
humans communicating online and there's

00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:16,400
humans communicating online and there's
 

179
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,190
humans communicating online and there's
probably ways to measure the degree of

00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:19,200
probably ways to measure the degree of

00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,830
probably ways to measure the degree of
you know as they talk about engagement

182
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:21,840
you know as they talk about engagement
 

183
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,589
you know as they talk about engagement
so you can probably optimize the

184
00:03:23,589 --> 00:03:23,599
so you can probably optimize the
 

185
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,509
so you can probably optimize the
question that's most

186
00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:25,519
question that's most

00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:28,000
created an engaging conversation in the
 

189
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,149
created an engaging conversation in the
past so actually if you strictly use the

190
00:03:30,149 --> 00:03:30,159
past so actually if you strictly use the
 

191
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,270
past so actually if you strictly use the
word exciting

192
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:33,280
word exciting
 

193
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,509

there is probably

194
00:03:35,509 --> 00:03:35,519
there is probably
 

195
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,030
there is probably
a way to create a optimally exciting

00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:39,040
a way to create a optimally exciting
 

197
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,309
a way to create a optimally exciting
conversations

198
00:03:40,309 --> 00:03:40,319
conversations
 

199
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,470

that are involved ai systems at least

200
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:42,480
that are involved ai systems at least
 

201
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,670
that are involved ai systems at least
one side is ai yeah that makes sense i

202
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:45,680
one side is ai yeah that makes sense i
 

203
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,470
one side is ai yeah that makes sense i
think

204
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:46,480
think
 

205
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,869
think
maybe looping back a bit to to games and

206
00:03:48,869 --> 00:03:48,879
maybe looping back a bit to to games and
 

207
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,430
maybe looping back a bit to to games and
the game industry when you design

00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:51,440
the game industry when you design
 

209
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,750
the game industry when you design
algorithms um you're thinking about

210
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:53,760
algorithms um you're thinking about
 

211
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,910
algorithms um you're thinking about
winning as the objective right or the

212
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:55,920
winning as the objective right or the
 

213
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,550
winning as the objective right or the
reward function but in fact when we

00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:58,560
reward function but in fact when we
 

215
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,630

discuss this with blizzard the creators

216
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:00,640
discuss this with blizzard the creators
 

217
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,030
discuss this with blizzard the creators
of starcraft in this case i think

218
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,040
of starcraft in this case i think
 

219
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,869
of starcraft in this case i think
what's exciting fun um if you could

220
00:04:06,869 --> 00:04:06,879
what's exciting fun um if you could
 

221
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,110
what's exciting fun um if you could
measure that and optimize for that

222
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:09,120
measure that and optimize for that
 

223
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,589
measure that and optimize for that
that's probably why we play video games

224
00:04:11,589 --> 00:04:11,599
that's probably why we play video games
 

225
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,750
that's probably why we play video games
or why we interact or listen or look at

226
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:13,760
or why we interact or listen or look at
 

227
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,390
or why we interact or listen or look at
cat videos or whatever on the internet

228
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:16,400
cat videos or whatever on the internet
 

229
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,830
cat videos or whatever on the internet
so it's true that modeling reward beyond

230
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:19,840
so it's true that modeling reward beyond
 

231
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,749
so it's true that modeling reward beyond
the obvious reward functions we've used

232
00:04:21,749 --> 00:04:21,759
the obvious reward functions we've used
 

233
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,830
the obvious reward functions we've used
to in reinforcement learning is

234
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:23,840
to in reinforcement learning is
 

235
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,950
to in reinforcement learning is
definitely very exciting and again there

236
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:26,960
definitely very exciting and again there
 

237
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,670
definitely very exciting and again there
is some progress actually into um a

238
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:29,680
is some progress actually into um a
 

239
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,510
is some progress actually into um a
particular aspect of ai which is quite

240
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:31,520
particular aspect of ai which is quite
 

241
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,550
particular aspect of ai which is quite
critical which is um for instance is a

242
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:34,560
critical which is um for instance is a
 

243
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,350
critical which is um for instance is a
conversation that or is the information

244
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:37,360
conversation that or is the information
 

245
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,749
conversation that or is the information
truthful right so you could start trying

246
00:04:39,749 --> 00:04:39,759
truthful right so you could start trying
 

247
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,629
truthful right so you could start trying
to evaluate um these from

248
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:42,639
to evaluate um these from
 

249
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,629
to evaluate um these from
except from the internet right that has

250
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:44,639
except from the internet right that has
 

251
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,590
except from the internet right that has
lots of information and then if you can

252
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:47,600
lots of information and then if you can
 

253
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,310
lots of information and then if you can
learn a function automated ideally so

254
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:50,320
learn a function automated ideally so
 

255
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,710
learn a function automated ideally so
you can also optimize it more easily

256
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:52,720
you can also optimize it more easily
 

257
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,909
you can also optimize it more easily
then you could actually have

258
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:53,919
then you could actually have
 

259
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,230
then you could actually have
conversations that optimize for

260
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:56,240
conversations that optimize for
 

261
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,270
conversations that optimize for
non-obvious things such as excitement

262
00:04:59,270 --> 00:04:59,280
non-obvious things such as excitement
 

263
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,510
non-obvious things such as excitement
so yeah that's quite possible and then i

264
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:01,520
so yeah that's quite possible and then i
 

265
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,749
so yeah that's quite possible and then i
would say in that case it would

266
00:05:03,749 --> 00:05:03,759
would say in that case it would
 

267
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,909
would say in that case it would
definitely be fun a fun exercise and

268
00:05:05,909 --> 00:05:05,919
definitely be fun a fun exercise and
 

269
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,909
definitely be fun a fun exercise and
quite unique to have at least one site

270
00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:07,919
quite unique to have at least one site
 

271
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,029
quite unique to have at least one site
that is fully driven by an excitement

272
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:11,039
that is fully driven by an excitement
 

273
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,629
that is fully driven by an excitement
reward function um but obviously

274
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:14,639
reward function um but obviously
 

275
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,230
reward function um but obviously
there would be still quite a lot of

276
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:16,240
there would be still quite a lot of
 

277
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,590
there would be still quite a lot of
humanity in the system both from who

278
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:19,600
humanity in the system both from who
 

279
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,350
humanity in the system both from who
who is building the system of course and

280
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:21,360
who is building the system of course and
 

281
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,870
who is building the system of course and
also

282
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:22,880
also
 

283
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,950
also
ultimately if we think of labeling for

284
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:24,960
ultimately if we think of labeling for
 

285
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,830
ultimately if we think of labeling for
excitement that those labels must come

286
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:27,840
excitement that those labels must come
 

287
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,990
excitement that those labels must come
from us because it's just

288
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:30,000
from us because it's just
 

289
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,029
from us because it's just
hard to

290
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:31,039
hard to
 

291
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,629
hard to
have a computational measure of

00:05:32,629 --> 00:05:32,639
have a computational measure of
 

293
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,469
have a computational measure of
excitement as far as i understand

294
00:05:34,469 --> 00:05:34,479
excitement as far as i understand
 

295
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,830
excitement as far as i understand
there's no such thing

296
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:37,840

 

297
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,430

you mentioned truth also i would

298
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:39,440
you mentioned truth also i would
 

299
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,230
you mentioned truth also i would
actually

300
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:40,240
actually
 

301
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,230
actually
venture to say that excitement is easier

302
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:42,240
venture to say that excitement is easier
 

303
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,150
venture to say that excitement is easier
to label than truth

304
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:44,160
to label than truth
 

305
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,749
to label than truth
or is perhaps uh has lower consequences

306
00:05:47,749 --> 00:05:47,759
or is perhaps uh has lower consequences
 

307
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,830
or is perhaps uh has lower consequences
of failure

308
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:49,840
of failure
 

309
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,590
of failure
but there is

310
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:51,600
but there is
 

311
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,270
but there is
perhaps

00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:53,280
perhaps
 

313
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,830
perhaps
the humanness that you mentioned that's

314
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:55,840
the humanness that you mentioned that's
 

315
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,590
the humanness that you mentioned that's
perhaps part of a thing that could be

316
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:57,600
perhaps part of a thing that could be
 

317
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,749
perhaps part of a thing that could be
labeled and that could mean

318
00:05:59,749 --> 00:05:59,759
labeled and that could mean
 

319
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,309
labeled and that could mean
an ai system that's doing dialogue

320
00:06:02,309 --> 00:06:02,319
an ai system that's doing dialogue
 

321
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,230
an ai system that's doing dialogue
that's doing conversations

that's doing conversations
 

323
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,590
that's doing conversations
should be

324
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:05,600
should be
 

325
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,510
should be
flawed for example

326
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:07,520
flawed for example
 

327
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,350
flawed for example
like that's the thing you optimize for

like that's the thing you optimize for
which is uh have inherent contradictions

00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:16,960
maybe it also needs to have a strong
 

335
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,710
maybe it also needs to have a strong
sense of identity

336
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:18,720
sense of identity
 

337
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,350
sense of identity
so it has a backstory it told itself

338
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:21,360
so it has a backstory it told itself
 

339
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,469
so it has a backstory it told itself
that it sticks to it has memories

340
00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:24,479
that it sticks to it has memories
 

341
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,309
that it sticks to it has memories
not in terms of the how the system is

342
00:06:26,309 --> 00:06:26,319
not in terms of the how the system is
 

343
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,309
not in terms of the how the system is
designed but it's able to tell stories

344
00:06:28,309 --> 00:06:28,319
designed but it's able to tell stories
 

345
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,390
designed but it's able to tell stories
about its past

346
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:30,400
about its past
 

347
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,270
about its past
it's

348
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:31,280
it's
 

349
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,830
it's
able to have

350
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:32,840
able to have
 

351
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,990
able to have
um mortality and fear of mortality in

352
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:36,000
um mortality and fear of mortality in
 

353
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,909
um mortality and fear of mortality in
the following way that it has an

354
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:37,919
the following way that it has an
 

355
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,029
the following way that it has an
identity

356
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:39,039
identity
 

357
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,270
identity
and like if it says something stupid and

358
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:41,280
and like if it says something stupid and
 

359
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,430
and like if it says something stupid and
gets cancelled on twitter that's the end

360
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:43,440
gets cancelled on twitter that's the end
 

361
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,430
gets cancelled on twitter that's the end
of that system so it's not like you get

362
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:45,440
of that system so it's not like you get
 

363
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,230
of that system so it's not like you get
to rebrand yourself that system is

364
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:48,240
to rebrand yourself that system is
 

365
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,469
to rebrand yourself that system is
that's it so maybe that the the

366
00:06:50,469 --> 00:06:50,479
that's it so maybe that the the
 

367
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,469
that's it so maybe that the the
high-stakes nature of it because like

368
00:06:52,469 --> 00:06:52,479
high-stakes nature of it because like
 

369
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,950
high-stakes nature of it because like
you can't say anything stupid now or oil

370
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:54,960
you can't say anything stupid now or oil
 

371
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,830
you can't say anything stupid now or oil
because

372
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:55,840
because
 

373
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,749
because
uh you'll be canceled on twitter and

374
00:06:57,749 --> 00:06:57,759
uh you'll be canceled on twitter and
 

375
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,749
uh you'll be canceled on twitter and
that there's there's stakes to that and

376
00:06:59,749 --> 00:06:59,759
that there's there's stakes to that and
 

377
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,110
that there's there's stakes to that and
that i think part of the reason that

378
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:01,120
that i think part of the reason that
 

379
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,629
that i think part of the reason that
makes it uh

380
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:02,639
makes it uh
 

381
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:03,990
makes it uh
interesting and then you have a

382
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:04,000
interesting and then you have a
 

383
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,749
interesting and then you have a
perspective like you've built up over

384
00:07:05,749 --> 00:07:05,759
perspective like you've built up over
 

385
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,990
perspective like you've built up over
time that you stick with and then people

386
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:08,000
time that you stick with and then people
 

387
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,909
time that you stick with and then people
can disagree with you so holding that

388
00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:09,919
can disagree with you so holding that
 

389
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,749
can disagree with you so holding that
perspective strongly

390
00:07:11,749 --> 00:07:11,759
perspective strongly
 

391
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,909
perspective strongly
holding sort of a maybe a controversial

392
00:07:13,909 --> 00:07:13,919
holding sort of a maybe a controversial
 

393
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,710
holding sort of a maybe a controversial
at least a strong opinion all of those

394
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:16,720
at least a strong opinion all of those
 

395
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,390
at least a strong opinion all of those
elements it feels like they can be

396
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:18,400
elements it feels like they can be
 

397
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,390
elements it feels like they can be
learned because it feels like there's a

398
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:20,400
learned because it feels like there's a
 

399
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,670
learned because it feels like there's a
lot of data

400
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:21,680
lot of data
 

401
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,830
lot of data
on the internet of people having an

402
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:23,840
on the internet of people having an
 

403
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,270
on the internet of people having an
opinion

404
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:25,280
opinion
 

405
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,029
opinion
and then combine that with a metric of

406
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:27,039
and then combine that with a metric of
 

407
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,710
and then combine that with a metric of
excitement you can start to create

408
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:28,720
excitement you can start to create
 

409
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,870
excitement you can start to create
something that as opposed to trying to

410
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:30,880
something that as opposed to trying to
 

411
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,510
something that as opposed to trying to
optimize for uh

412
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:33,520
optimize for uh
 

413
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,469
optimize for uh
sort of

414
00:07:34,469 --> 00:07:34,479
sort of
 

415
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,990
sort of
grammatical clarity and truthfulness

416
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:38,000
grammatical clarity and truthfulness
 

417
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,909
grammatical clarity and truthfulness
the the factual

418
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:39,919
the the factual
 

419
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,070
the the factual
consistency over many sentences you're

420
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:42,080
consistency over many sentences you're
 

421
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,670
consistency over many sentences you're
optimized for

422
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:43,680
optimized for
 

423
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,189
optimized for
the humanness

424
00:07:45,189 --> 00:07:45,199
the humanness
 

425
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,270
the humanness
and there's obviously data for humanness

426
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:47,280
and there's obviously data for humanness
 

427
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,710
and there's obviously data for humanness
on the internet

428
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:48,720
on the internet
 

429
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,070
on the internet
so i wonder

430
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:50,080
so i wonder
 

431
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,670
so i wonder
i wonder if there's a future where

432
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:51,680
i wonder if there's a future where
 

433
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,589
i wonder if there's a future where
that's part

434
00:07:53,589 --> 00:07:53,599
that's part
 

435
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,749
that's part
or i mean i i i sometimes wonder that

436
00:07:55,749 --> 00:07:55,759
or i mean i i i sometimes wonder that
 

437
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,990
or i mean i i i sometimes wonder that
about myself i'm a huge fan of podcasts

438
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:58,000
about myself i'm a huge fan of podcasts
 

439
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,790
about myself i'm a huge fan of podcasts
and i listen to poc some podcasts and i

440
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:00,800
and i listen to poc some podcasts and i
 

441
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,869
and i listen to poc some podcasts and i
think like what is interesting about

442
00:08:02,869 --> 00:08:02,879
think like what is interesting about
 

443
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,510
think like what is interesting about
this what is compelling

444
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:05,520
this what is compelling
 

445
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,270
this what is compelling
uh the same way you watch other games

446
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:07,280
uh the same way you watch other games
 

447
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,629
uh the same way you watch other games
like you said watch play starcraft or

448
00:08:10,629 --> 00:08:10,639
like you said watch play starcraft or
 

449
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,950
like you said watch play starcraft or
have magnus carlsen play chess

450
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:12,960
have magnus carlsen play chess
 

451
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,029
have magnus carlsen play chess
so i'm not a chess player so but it's

452
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:15,039
so i'm not a chess player so but it's
 

453
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,629
so i'm not a chess player so but it's
still interesting to me and what is that

454
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:16,639
still interesting to me and what is that
 

455
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,830
still interesting to me and what is that
that's the

456
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:17,840
that's the
 

457
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,029
that's the
uh the stakes of it maybe um the end of

458
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:21,039
uh the stakes of it maybe um the end of
 

459
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,430
uh the stakes of it maybe um the end of
a domination of a series of wins i don't

460
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:23,440
a domination of a series of wins i don't
 

461
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,350
a domination of a series of wins i don't
know there's all those elements

462
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:25,360
know there's all those elements
 

463
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,110
know there's all those elements
somehow connect to a compelling

464
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:27,120
somehow connect to a compelling
 

465
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,029
somehow connect to a compelling
conversation and i wonder how hard is

466
00:08:29,029 --> 00:08:29,039
conversation and i wonder how hard is
 

467
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,950
conversation and i wonder how hard is
that to replace because ultimately all

468
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:30,960
that to replace because ultimately all
 

469
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,509
that to replace because ultimately all
of that connects the initial proposition

470
00:08:33,509 --> 00:08:33,519
of that connects the initial proposition
 

471
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,269
of that connects the initial proposition
of how to test

472
00:08:35,269 --> 00:08:35,279
of how to test
 

473
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,110
of how to test
whether an ai is intelligent or not with

474
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:37,120
whether an ai is intelligent or not with
 

475
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,709
whether an ai is intelligent or not with
the turing test

476
00:08:38,709 --> 00:08:38,719
the turing test
 

477
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,430
the turing test
which i guess my question comes from a

478
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:41,440
which i guess my question comes from a
 

479
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,589
which i guess my question comes from a
place of the spirit of that test

480
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:43,599
place of the spirit of that test
 

481
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,910
place of the spirit of that test
yes um i actually recall i was just

482
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:45,920
yes um i actually recall i was just
 

483
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,150
yes um i actually recall i was just
listening to our first podcast where we

484
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:48,160
listening to our first podcast where we
 

485
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,269
listening to our first podcast where we
discussed turing tests um so

486
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:51,279
discussed turing tests um so
 

487
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,470
discussed turing tests um so
i would say

488
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:52,480
i would say
 

489
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,430
i would say
from a

490
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:53,440
from a
 

491
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,070
from a
neural network you know ai builder

492
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:56,080
neural network you know ai builder
 

493
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,790
neural network you know ai builder
perspective um there's

494
00:08:58,790 --> 00:08:58,800
perspective um there's
 

495
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,750
perspective um there's
you know usually you try to map many of

496
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:01,760
you know usually you try to map many of
 

497
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,990
you know usually you try to map many of
these interesting topics you discuss to

498
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:04,000
these interesting topics you discuss to
 

499
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,870
these interesting topics you discuss to
to benchmarks and then also to actual

500
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:06,880
to benchmarks and then also to actual
 

501
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,670
to benchmarks and then also to actual
architectures on the how these systems

502
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:09,680
architectures on the how these systems
 

503
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,829
architectures on the how these systems
are currently built how they learn what

504
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:11,839
are currently built how they learn what
 

505
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,590
are currently built how they learn what
data they learn from what are they

506
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:13,600
data they learn from what are they
 

507
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,269
data they learn from what are they
learning right we're talking about

508
00:09:15,269 --> 00:09:15,279
learning right we're talking about
 

509
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,829
learning right we're talking about
weights of a mathematical function and

510
00:09:17,829 --> 00:09:17,839
weights of a mathematical function and
 

511
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,110
weights of a mathematical function and
then looking at the current state of the

512
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:21,120
then looking at the current state of the
 

513
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,710
then looking at the current state of the
game maybe

514
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:22,720
game maybe
 

515
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,389
game maybe
what do we

516
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:24,399
what do we
 

517
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,870
what do we
need leaps forward to get to the

518
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:26,880
need leaps forward to get to the
 

519
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,070
need leaps forward to get to the
ultimate stage of all these experiences

520
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:30,080
ultimate stage of all these experiences
 

521
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,030
ultimate stage of all these experiences
um lifetime experience of fears like

522
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:33,040
um lifetime experience of fears like
 

523
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,790
um lifetime experience of fears like
words that currently

524
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:34,800
words that currently
 

525
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,910
words that currently
barely we're we're seeing um progress

526
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:37,920
barely we're we're seeing um progress
 

527
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,630
barely we're we're seeing um progress
just because what's happening today is

528
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:40,640
just because what's happening today is
 

529
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,670
just because what's happening today is
you take

530
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:41,680
you take
 

531
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,150
you take
all these human interactions um it's a

532
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:44,160
all these human interactions um it's a
 

533
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,389
all these human interactions um it's a
large bust of variety of human

534
00:09:46,389 --> 00:09:46,399
large bust of variety of human
 

535
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,389
large bust of variety of human
interactions online and then you're

536
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:48,399
interactions online and then you're
 

537
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,630
interactions online and then you're
distilling these

538
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:50,640
distilling these
 

539
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,870
distilling these
sequences right going back to my passion

540
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:52,880
sequences right going back to my passion
 

541
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,750
sequences right going back to my passion
like sequences of words letters um

542
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:55,760
like sequences of words letters um
 

543
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,829
like sequences of words letters um
images sound there's more modalities

544
00:09:57,829 --> 00:09:57,839
images sound there's more modalities
 

545
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,389
images sound there's more modalities
here to be to be at play and then you're

546
00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:00,399
here to be to be at play and then you're
 

547
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,230
here to be to be at play and then you're
trying to

548
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:02,240
trying to
 

549
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,310
trying to
just learn a function that will be happy

550
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:04,320
just learn a function that will be happy
 

551
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,110
just learn a function that will be happy
that maximizes the the likelihood of

552
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:07,120
that maximizes the the likelihood of
 

553
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,430
that maximizes the the likelihood of
seeing all these um through a neural

554
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:09,440
seeing all these um through a neural
 

555
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,910
seeing all these um through a neural
network um now

556
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:11,920
network um now
 

557
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,670
network um now
i think there's a few

558
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:13,680
i think there's a few
 

559
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,150
i think there's a few
places where the way currently we train

560
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:16,160
places where the way currently we train
 

561
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,949
places where the way currently we train
these models would clearly like to be

562
00:10:18,949 --> 00:10:18,959
these models would clearly like to be
 

563
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,389
these models would clearly like to be
able to develop the kinds of

564
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:20,399
able to develop the kinds of
 

565
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,710
able to develop the kinds of
capabilities you save i'll tell you

566
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:22,720
capabilities you save i'll tell you
 

567
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,710
capabilities you save i'll tell you
maybe a couple one is

568
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:24,720
maybe a couple one is
 

569
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,509
maybe a couple one is
the lifetime of an agent or a model

570
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:27,519
the lifetime of an agent or a model
 

571
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:28,870
the lifetime of an agent or a model
so you

572
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:28,880
so you
 

573
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,710
so you
you learn from this data offline right

574
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:30,720
you learn from this data offline right
 

575
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,389
you learn from this data offline right
so you're just passively observing and

576
00:10:32,389 --> 00:10:32,399
so you're just passively observing and
 

577
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,150
so you're just passively observing and
maximizing this you know it's almost

578
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:34,160
maximizing this you know it's almost
 

579
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,710
maximizing this you know it's almost
like a mountains like a landscape of

00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:36,720
like a mountains like a landscape of
 

581
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,710
like a mountains like a landscape of
mountains and then everywhere there's

582
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:38,720
mountains and then everywhere there's
 

583
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,870
mountains and then everywhere there's
data that humans interacted in this way

584
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:40,880
data that humans interacted in this way
 

585
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,030
data that humans interacted in this way
you're trying to make that higher and

586
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:43,040
you're trying to make that higher and
 

587
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,790
you're trying to make that higher and
then you know lower where there's no

588
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:44,800
then you know lower where there's no
 

589
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,550
then you know lower where there's no
data and then these models generally

590
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:48,560
data and then these models generally
 

591
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,430
data and then these models generally
don't

592
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:49,440
don't
 

593
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,190
don't
then experience themselves these they

594
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:51,200
then experience themselves these they
 

595
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,949
then experience themselves these they
just are observers right they're passive

596
00:10:52,949 --> 00:10:52,959
just are observers right they're passive
 

597
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,190
just are observers right they're passive
observers of the data and then we're

598
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:55,200
observers of the data and then we're
 

599
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,670
observers of the data and then we're
putting them to then generate data when

600
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:57,680
putting them to then generate data when
 

601
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,910
putting them to then generate data when
we interact with them but that's very

602
00:10:59,910 --> 00:10:59,920
we interact with them but that's very
 

603
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,990
we interact with them but that's very
limiting the experience they actually

604
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:02,000
limiting the experience they actually
 

605
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,710
limiting the experience they actually
experience um when they could maybe be

606
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:04,720
experience um when they could maybe be
 

607
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,949

has a hard drive that has a lot of
information you have access to the

662
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:03,519
information you have access to the
 

663
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,269
information you have access to the
internet which has probably all the

664
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:05,279
internet which has probably all the
 

665
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,509
internet which has probably all the
information but there's also a working

666
00:12:07,509 --> 00:12:07,519
information but there's also a working
 

667
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,470
information but there's also a working
memory

668
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:08,480
memory
 

669
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,949
memory
where the these agents as we call them

670
00:12:10,949 --> 00:12:10,959
where the these agents as we call them
 

671
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,829
where the these agents as we call them
or start calling them build upon

672
00:12:13,829 --> 00:12:13,839
or start calling them build upon
 

673
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,550
or start calling them build upon
now this memory is very limited um i

674
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:16,560
now this memory is very limited um i
 

675
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,629
now this memory is very limited um i
mean right now we're talking to be

676
00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:18,639
mean right now we're talking to be
 

677
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,670
mean right now we're talking to be
concrete about 2 000 words that we hold

678
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:21,680
concrete about 2 000 words that we hold
 

679
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,670
concrete about 2 000 words that we hold
and then beyond that we start forgetting

680
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:23,680
and then beyond that we start forgetting
 

681
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,389
and then beyond that we start forgetting
what we've seen so you can see that

682
00:12:26,389 --> 00:12:26,399
what we've seen so you can see that
 

683
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:27,990
what we've seen so you can see that
there's some short-term coherence

684
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:28,000
there's some short-term coherence
 

685
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,990
there's some short-term coherence
already right with when you said i mean

686
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:30,000
already right with when you said i mean
 

687
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,629
already right with when you said i mean
it's a very interesting topic um having

688
00:12:32,629 --> 00:12:32,639
it's a very interesting topic um having
 

689
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,550
it's a very interesting topic um having
sort of a mapping

690
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:34,560
sort of a mapping
 

691
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,269
sort of a mapping
um an agent to like have consistency

692
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:37,279
um an agent to like have consistency
 

693
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,350
um an agent to like have consistency
then you know if if you say oh what's

694
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:39,360
then you know if if you say oh what's
 

695
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,310
then you know if if you say oh what's
your name um it could remember that but

696
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:42,320
your name um it could remember that but
 

697
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,870
your name um it could remember that but
then it might forget beyond 2000 words

698
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:44,880
then it might forget beyond 2000 words
 

699
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,069
then it might forget beyond 2000 words
which is not

700
00:12:46,069 --> 00:12:46,079
which is not
 

701
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,150
which is not
that long of context if we think even of

702
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:48,160
that long of context if we think even of
 

703
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,670
that long of context if we think even of
these podcast um books are much longer

704
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:51,680
these podcast um books are much longer
 

705
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,710
these podcast um books are much longer
so

706
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:52,720
so
 

707
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,910
so
technically speaking there's a

708
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:53,920
technically speaking there's a
 

709
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,150
technically speaking there's a
limitation there super exciting from

710
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:56,160
limitation there super exciting from
 

711
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,550
limitation there super exciting from
people that work on deep learning to be

712
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:58,560
people that work on deep learning to be
 

713
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,910
people that work on deep learning to be
working on

714
00:12:59,910 --> 00:12:59,920
working on
 

715
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,949
working on
but

716
00:13:00,949 --> 00:13:00,959
but
 

717
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,110
but
i would say we lack maybe benchmarks and

718
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:03,120
i would say we lack maybe benchmarks and
 

719
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,790
i would say we lack maybe benchmarks and
the technology to have

720
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:04,800
the technology to have
 

721
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,710
the technology to have
this lifetime

722
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:06,720
this lifetime
 

723
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,269
this lifetime
like experience of memory that keeps

724
00:13:09,269 --> 00:13:09,279
like experience of memory that keeps
 

725
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,470
like experience of memory that keeps
building up

726
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:10,480
building up
 

727
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,269
building up
um however the way it learns offline is

728
00:13:13,269 --> 00:13:13,279
um however the way it learns offline is
 

729
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,750
um however the way it learns offline is
clearly very powerful right so

730
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:15,760
clearly very powerful right so
 

731
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,269
clearly very powerful right so
i you know you asked me three years ago

732
00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:17,279
i you know you asked me three years ago
 

733
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,190
i you know you asked me three years ago
i would say oh we're very far i think

734
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:19,200
i would say oh we're very far i think
 

735
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,150
i would say oh we're very far i think
we've seen the power of this imitation

736
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:22,160
we've seen the power of this imitation
 

737
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,190
we've seen the power of this imitation
again

738
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:23,200
again
 

739
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,350
again
on the internet scale that has enabled

740
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:25,360
on the internet scale that has enabled
 

741
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,030
on the internet scale that has enabled
this um to

742
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:27,040
this um to
 

743
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,790
this um to
feel like at least the knowledge the

744
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:28,800
feel like at least the knowledge the
 

745
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,790
feel like at least the knowledge the
basic knowledge about the world now is

746
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:30,800
basic knowledge about the world now is
 

747
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,030
basic knowledge about the world now is
incorporated into the weights

748
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:33,040
incorporated into the weights
 

749
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,389
incorporated into the weights
but then this

750
00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:34,399
but then this
 

751
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,430
but then this
experience is lacking and in fact as i

752
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:37,440
experience is lacking and in fact as i
 

753
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,829
experience is lacking and in fact as i
said we don't even train them when you

754
00:13:39,829 --> 00:13:39,839
said we don't even train them when you
 

755
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,430
said we don't even train them when you
know when we're talking to them other

756
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:41,440
know when we're talking to them other
 

757
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,150
know when we're talking to them other
than

758
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:42,160
than
 

759
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,069
than
their working memory of course is

760
00:13:44,069 --> 00:13:44,079
their working memory of course is
 

761
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,870
their working memory of course is
affected so that's the dynamic part but

762
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:46,880
affected so that's the dynamic part but
 

763
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,310
affected so that's the dynamic part but
they don't learn in the same way that

764
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:48,320
they don't learn in the same way that
 

765
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,550
they don't learn in the same way that
you and i have learned right when

766
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:50,560
you and i have learned right when
 

767
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,470
you and i have learned right when
from basically when we were born and

768
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:52,480
from basically when we were born and
 

769
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,910
from basically when we were born and
probably before

770
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:53,920
probably before
 

771
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,990
probably before
so lots of fascinating interesting

772
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:56,000
so lots of fascinating interesting
 

773
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,030
so lots of fascinating interesting
questions you asked there i think um

774
00:13:59,030 --> 00:13:59,040
questions you asked there i think um
 

775
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,030
questions you asked there i think um
the one i mentioned is this idea of

776
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:01,040
the one i mentioned is this idea of
 

777
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,910
the one i mentioned is this idea of
memory and experience versus just kind

778
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:03,920
memory and experience versus just kind
 

779
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,230
memory and experience versus just kind
of observe the world and learn its

780
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:06,240
of observe the world and learn its
 

781
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,230
of observe the world and learn its
knowledge which i think for that i would

782
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:08,240
knowledge which i think for that i would
 

783
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,710
knowledge which i think for that i would
argue lots of recent advancements that

784
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:10,720
argue lots of recent advancements that
 

785
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,269
argue lots of recent advancements that
make me very excited about the field

786
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:13,279
make me very excited about the field
 

787
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,110
make me very excited about the field
and then the second

788
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:15,120
and then the second
 

789
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,069
and then the second
maybe issue that i see is

790
00:14:18,069 --> 00:14:18,079
maybe issue that i see is
 

791
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,590
maybe issue that i see is
all these models

792
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:19,600
all these models
 

793
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,750
all these models
we train them from scratch that's

794
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:21,760
we train them from scratch that's
 

795
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,350
we train them from scratch that's
something i would have complained three

796
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:23,360
something i would have complained three
 

797
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,430
something i would have complained three
years ago or six years ago or 10 years

798
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:25,440
years ago or six years ago or 10 years
 

799
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,310
years ago or six years ago or 10 years
ago

800
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:26,320
ago
 

801
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,829
ago
and it feels

802
00:14:27,829 --> 00:14:27,839
and it feels
 

803
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,790
and it feels
if we take inspiration from how we got

804
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:30,800
if we take inspiration from how we got
 

805
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,670
if we take inspiration from how we got
here how the universe evolved us

806
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:33,680
here how the universe evolved us
 

807
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,389
here how the universe evolved us
and we keep evolving it feels

808
00:14:36,389 --> 00:14:36,399
and we keep evolving it feels
 

809
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:38,389
and we keep evolving it feels
that is a missing piece that we should

810
00:14:38,389 --> 00:14:38,399
that is a missing piece that we should
 

811
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,269
that is a missing piece that we should
not be training models from scratch um

812
00:14:41,269 --> 00:14:41,279
not be training models from scratch um
 

813
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,430
not be training models from scratch um
every few months that there should be

814
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:43,440
every few months that there should be
 

815
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,870
every few months that there should be
some sort of

816
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:44,880
some sort of
 

817
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,670
some sort of
way in which we can grow models um much

818
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:47,680
way in which we can grow models um much
 

819
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,150
way in which we can grow models um much
like as a species and many other

820
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:50,160
like as a species and many other
 

821
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,069
like as a species and many other
elements in the universe is building

822
00:14:52,069 --> 00:14:52,079
elements in the universe is building
 

823
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,949
elements in the universe is building
from the previous sort of iterations

824
00:14:54,949 --> 00:14:54,959
from the previous sort of iterations
 

825
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,670
from the previous sort of iterations
and that from uh just purely neural

826
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:57,680
and that from uh just purely neural
 

827
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,430
and that from uh just purely neural
network perspective

828
00:14:59,430 --> 00:14:59,440
network perspective
 

829
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,750
network perspective
even though we we would like to make it

830
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:01,760
even though we we would like to make it
 

831
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,189
even though we we would like to make it
work it's proven very hard to not

832
00:15:05,189 --> 00:15:05,199
work it's proven very hard to not
 

833
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,269
work it's proven very hard to not
you know throw away the previous weights

834
00:15:07,269 --> 00:15:07,279
you know throw away the previous weights
 

835
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,189
you know throw away the previous weights
right this landscape we learn from the

836
00:15:09,189 --> 00:15:09,199
right this landscape we learn from the
 

837
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,509
right this landscape we learn from the
data and you know refresh it with a

838
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:11,519
data and you know refresh it with a
 

839
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,150
data and you know refresh it with a
brand new set of weights um given

840
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:14,160
brand new set of weights um given
 

841
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,110
brand new set of weights um given
maybe a

842
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:15,120
maybe a
 

843
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,030
maybe a
recent snapshot of these data sets we

844
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:17,040
recent snapshot of these data sets we
 

845
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,110
recent snapshot of these data sets we
train on etc or even a new game we're

846
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:19,120
train on etc or even a new game we're
 

847
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,949
train on etc or even a new game we're
learning so that's

848
00:15:20,949 --> 00:15:20,959
learning so that's
 

849
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,189
learning so that's
that feels like something is missing

850
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:23,199
that feels like something is missing
 

851
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:26,150
that feels like something is missing
fundamentally we might find it but it's

852
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:26,160
fundamentally we might find it but it's
 

853
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,310
fundamentally we might find it but it's
not very clear how it will look like

854
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:28,320
not very clear how it will look like
 

855
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,829
not very clear how it will look like
there's many ideas and it's super

856
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:29,839
there's many ideas and it's super
 

857
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,749
there's many ideas and it's super
exciting as well yes just for people who

858
00:15:31,749 --> 00:15:31,759
exciting as well yes just for people who
 

859
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,430
exciting as well yes just for people who
don't know when you approach a new

860
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:33,440
don't know when you approach a new
 

861
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,670
don't know when you approach a new
problem in machine learning

862
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:35,680
problem in machine learning
 

863
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,030
problem in machine learning
you're going to come up with an

864
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:37,040
you're going to come up with an
 

865
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,310
you're going to come up with an
architecture that has a a bunch of

866
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:40,320
architecture that has a a bunch of
 

867
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,389
architecture that has a a bunch of
weights and then you initialize them

868
00:15:42,389 --> 00:15:42,399
weights and then you initialize them
 

869
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,310
weights and then you initialize them
somehow which

870
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:44,320
somehow which
 

871
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,189
somehow which
in most cases is some version of random

872
00:15:47,189 --> 00:15:47,199
in most cases is some version of random
 

873
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,550
in most cases is some version of random
so that's what you mean by starting from

874
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:48,560
so that's what you mean by starting from
 

875
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,230
so that's what you mean by starting from
scratch and it seems like it's a it's a

876
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:50,240
scratch and it seems like it's a it's a
 

877
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,189
scratch and it seems like it's a it's a
waste

878
00:15:51,189 --> 00:15:51,199
waste
 

879
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:52,829

to be
and throw away the other stuff

912
00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:27,279
and throw away the other stuff
 

913
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,430
and throw away the other stuff
uh and maybe the neural network itself

914
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:29,440
uh and maybe the neural network itself
 

915
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,509
uh and maybe the neural network itself
should be able to tell you that

916
00:16:31,509 --> 00:16:31,519
should be able to tell you that
 

917
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:32,790
should be able to tell you that
like what

918
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:32,800
like what
 

919
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,269
like what
um yeah how do you what ideas do you

920
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:35,279
um yeah how do you what ideas do you
 

921
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,710
um yeah how do you what ideas do you
have for better initialization of

00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:36,720
have for better initialization of
 

923
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,189
have for better initialization of
weights maybe stepping back if we look

00:16:39,189 --> 00:16:39,199
weights maybe stepping back if we look
 

925
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,749
weights maybe stepping back if we look
at the field of machine learning but

926
00:16:41,749 --> 00:16:41,759
at the field of machine learning but
 

927
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,509
at the field of machine learning but
especially deep learning

928
00:16:43,509 --> 00:16:43,519
especially deep learning
 

929
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,110
especially deep learning
right at the core of deep learning

930
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:45,120
right at the core of deep learning
 

931
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,670
right at the core of deep learning
there's this beautiful idea that is

932
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:47,680
there's this beautiful idea that is
 

933
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,550
there's this beautiful idea that is
a single algorithm can solve any task

934
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:50,560
a single algorithm can solve any task
 

935
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,990
a single algorithm can solve any task
right so

936
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:52,000
right so
 

937
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,790
right so
it's been proven over and over with more

938
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:54,800
it's been proven over and over with more
 

939
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,030
it's been proven over and over with more
increasing set of benchmarks and things

941
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,269
increasing set of benchmarks and things
that were thought impossible that are

942
00:16:59,269 --> 00:16:59,279
that were thought impossible that are

being cracked by this basic principle
 

945
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:02,870
being cracked by this basic principle
that is

946
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:02,880
that is
 

947
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,549
that is
you take a neural network of

948
00:17:04,549 --> 00:17:04,559
you take a neural network of
 

949
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,270
you take a neural network of
uninitialized ways so like a blank

950
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:07,280
uninitialized ways so like a blank
 

951

um then you give it
 

955
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,110
um then you give it
in the case of supervised learning a lot

956
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:13,120
in the case of supervised learning a lot
 

957
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,990

is like but many many if not all

970
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:28,559
is like but many many if not all
 

971
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,549
is like but many many if not all
problems can be mapped this way

972
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:30,559
problems can be mapped this way
 

973
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:31,750
problems can be mapped this way
and then

974
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:31,760
and then
 

975
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,990
and then
there's a generic recipe right that you

976
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:34,000
there's a generic recipe right that you
 

977
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,029
there's a generic recipe right that you
can use

978
00:17:35,029 --> 00:17:35,039
can use
 

979
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,590
can use
um and this recipe with

980
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:37,600
um and this recipe with
 

981
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,190
um and this recipe with
very little change and i think that's

982
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:39,200
very little change and i think that's
 

983
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,430
very little change and i think that's
the core of deep learning research right

the core of deep learning research right
 

985
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,669
the core of deep learning research right
that what is the recipe that is

986
00:17:43,669 --> 00:17:43,679
that what is the recipe that is
 

987
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,230
that what is the recipe that is
universal that for any new given task

988
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:46,240
universal that for any new given task
 

989
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,310
universal that for any new given task
i'll be able to use without thinking

two three years
 

1077
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,430
two three years
and when we last spoke i mentioned this

1078
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:25,440
and when we last spoke i mentioned this
 

1079
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,270
and when we last spoke i mentioned this
area of metal learning which is the idea

the language domain only in which you

1088
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:38,400
the language domain only in which you
 

1089
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,110
the language domain only in which you
could conceive a model that is trained

00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:41,120
could conceive a model that is trained
 

1091
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,070
could conceive a model that is trained
once and then this model is not narrow

you could teach it by a prompting is

1102
00:19:55,029 --> 00:19:55,039
you could teach it by a prompting is
 

1103
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,710
you could teach it by a prompting is
called and this prompting is essentially

1104
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:56,720
called and this prompting is essentially
 

1105
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,750
called and this prompting is essentially
just showing it a few more examples um

1106
00:19:59,750 --> 00:19:59,760
just showing it a few more examples um
 

1107
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,750
just showing it a few more examples um
almost like you do show examples input

1108
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:01,760
almost like you do show examples input
 

1109
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,909

but now you're doing it through language

1114
00:20:07,669 --> 00:20:07,679
but now you're doing it through language
 

1115
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,830
but now you're doing it through language
which is very natural way for us to

00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:09,840
which is very natural way for us to
 

1117
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,830
which is very natural way for us to
learn from one another i tell you hey

1118
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:11,840
learn from one another i tell you hey
 

1119
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,590
learn from one another i tell you hey
you should do this new task i'll tell

1120
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:13,600
you should do this new task i'll tell
 

1121
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,270
you should do this new task i'll tell
you a bit more maybe you asked me some

1122
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:15,280
you a bit more maybe you asked me some
 

1123
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,430
you a bit more maybe you asked me some
questions and now you know the task

1124
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:17,440
questions and now you know the task
 

1125
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,350
questions and now you know the task
right you didn't need to retrain it from

1126
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:19,360
right you didn't need to retrain it from
 

1127
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,990
right you didn't need to retrain it from
scratch and we've seen these magical

1128
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:22,000
scratch and we've seen these magical
 

1129
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,270
scratch and we've seen these magical
moments almost um in this way to do

1130
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:25,280
moments almost um in this way to do
 

1131
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,950
moments almost um in this way to do

language only domain and then in the

1134
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:28,960

1135
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,230

00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:30,240
last
 

1137
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,789

00:20:32,789 --> 00:20:32,799
two years we've seen these expanded to
 

1139
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,470
two years we've seen these expanded to
beyond language

1140

we going to crack this problem this is
 

1149
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,390
we going to crack this problem this is
perhaps one way in which you have a

00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:46,400
perhaps one way in which you have a
 

1151
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,549
perhaps one way in which you have a
single model

1152
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:48,559
single model
 

1153
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,549
single model
the problem of this model is it's hard

1154
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:50,559
the problem of this model is it's hard
 

1155
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,070
the problem of this model is it's hard
to grow

1156
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:52,080
to grow
 

1157
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,110
to grow
in weights or capacity but the model is

1158
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:55,120
in weights or capacity but the model is
 

1159
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,110
in weights or capacity but the model is
certainly so powerful that you can teach

1160
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:57,120
certainly so powerful that you can teach
 

1161
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,830
certainly so powerful that you can teach
it some tasks right in this way that i

1162
00:20:59,830 --> 00:20:59,840
it some tasks right in this way that i
 

1163
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,590
it some tasks right in this way that i
teach you i could teach you a new task

1164
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:01,600
teach you i could teach you a new task
 

1165
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,070
teach you i could teach you a new task
now if we were oh let's a text a

1166
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:04,080
now if we were oh let's a text a
 

1167
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,070
now if we were oh let's a text a
text-based task or a classification a

1168
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:06,080
text-based task or a classification a
 

1169
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,230
text-based task or a classification a
vision style task

1170
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:08,240
vision style task
 

1171
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,470
vision style task
but it still feels like more

1172
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:10,480
but it still feels like more
 

1173
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,110
but it still feels like more
breakthroughs should be hot but it's a

1174
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:13,120
breakthroughs should be hot but it's a
 

1175
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,390
breakthroughs should be hot but it's a
great beginning right we have a good

1176
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:14,400
great beginning right we have a good
 

1177
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,190
great beginning right we have a good
baseline we have an idea that this maybe

1178
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:17,200
baseline we have an idea that this maybe
 

1179
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,270
baseline we have an idea that this maybe
is the way we want to benchmark progress

1180
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:19,280
is the way we want to benchmark progress
 

1181
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,990
is the way we want to benchmark progress
towards agi and i think in my view

1182
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:22,000
towards agi and i think in my view
 

1183
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,909
towards agi and i think in my view
that's critical to always have a way to

1184
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:23,919
that's critical to always have a way to
 

1185
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:25,990
that's critical to always have a way to
benchmark the community sort of

1186
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:26,000
benchmark the community sort of
 

1187
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,230
benchmark the community sort of
converging to this overall which is good

1188
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:28,240
converging to this overall which is good
 

1189
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,110
converging to this overall which is good
to see

1190
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:29,120
to see
 

1191
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,310
to see
and then this is actually

1192
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:32,320
and then this is actually
 

1193
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,470
and then this is actually
what excites me in terms of also next

1194
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:34,480
what excites me in terms of also next
 

1195
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,350
what excites me in terms of also next
steps um for deep learning is how to

1196
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:37,360
steps um for deep learning is how to
 

1197
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,270
steps um for deep learning is how to
make these models more powerful how do

1198
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:39,280
make these models more powerful how do
 

1199
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,909
make these models more powerful how do
you train them how to grow them if they

1200
00:21:41,909 --> 00:21:41,919
you train them how to grow them if they
 

1201
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:43,909
you train them how to grow them if they
must grow should they change their

1202
00:21:43,909 --> 00:21:43,919
must grow should they change their
 

1203
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,909
must grow should they change their
weights as you teach it the task or not

1204
00:21:45,909 --> 00:21:45,919
weights as you teach it the task or not
 

1205
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:47,669
weights as you teach it the task or not
there's some interesting questions many

1206
00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:47,679
there's some interesting questions many
 

1207
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,110
there's some interesting questions many
to be answered yeah you've opened the

1208
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:49,120
to be answered yeah you've opened the
 

1209
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,630
to be answered yeah you've opened the
door about

1210
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:50,640
door about
 

1211
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,070
door about
to a bunch of questions i want to ask

1212
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:52,080
to a bunch of questions i want to ask
 

1213
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,310
to a bunch of questions i want to ask
but let's first return to the

1214
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:54,320
but let's first return to the
 

1215
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,390
but let's first return to the
uh to your tweet and read it like a

1216
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:56,400
uh to your tweet and read it like a
 

1217
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,270
uh to your tweet and read it like a
shakespeare you wrote gato is not the

1218
00:21:59,270 --> 00:21:59,280
shakespeare you wrote gato is not the
 

1219
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,990
shakespeare you wrote gato is not the
end it's the beginning and then he wrote

1220
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:02,000
end it's the beginning and then he wrote
 

1221
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,590
end it's the beginning and then he wrote
meow and then an emoji of a cat

1222
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:05,600
meow and then an emoji of a cat
 

1223
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,070
meow and then an emoji of a cat
uh so first two questions first can you

1224
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:08,080
uh so first two questions first can you
 

1225
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,070
uh so first two questions first can you
explain the meow and the cat emoji and

1226
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:10,080
explain the meow and the cat emoji and
 

1227
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,470
explain the meow and the cat emoji and
second can you explain what gatto is and

1228
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:12,480
second can you explain what gatto is and
 

1229
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,350
second can you explain what gatto is and
how it works right indeed i mean thanks

1230
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:15,360
how it works right indeed i mean thanks
 

1231
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,830
how it works right indeed i mean thanks
thanks for reminding me that we're all

1232
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:17,840
thanks for reminding me that we're all
 

1233
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,830
thanks for reminding me that we're all
exposing on twitter and

1234
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:19,840
exposing on twitter and
 

1235
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,990
exposing on twitter and
permanently there yes permanently one of

1236
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:22,000
permanently there yes permanently one of
 

1237
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,029
permanently there yes permanently one of
the greatest ai researchers of all time

1238
00:22:25,029 --> 00:22:25,039
the greatest ai researchers of all time
 

1239
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:28,149
the greatest ai researchers of all time
meow and cat emoji yes there you go

1240
00:22:28,149 --> 00:22:28,159
meow and cat emoji yes there you go
 

1241
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,789
meow and cat emoji yes there you go
right so can you imagine like touring uh

1242
00:22:30,789 --> 00:22:30,799
right so can you imagine like touring uh
 

1243
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:31,750
right so can you imagine like touring uh
tweeting

1244
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:31,760
tweeting
 

1245
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,830
tweeting
meow and cat probably he would probably

1246
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:33,840
meow and cat probably he would probably
 

1247
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,070
meow and cat probably he would probably
would probably so yeah the tweet

1248
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:36,080
would probably so yeah the tweet
 

1249
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,630
would probably so yeah the tweet
is important actually um you know i put

1250
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:38,640
is important actually um you know i put
 

1251
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,630
is important actually um you know i put
thought on the tweets i hope people

1252
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:40,640
thought on the tweets i hope people
 

1253
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,870
thought on the tweets i hope people
which part you think okay

1254
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:42,880
which part you think okay
 

1255
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,789
which part you think okay
so there's three sentences

1256
00:22:44,789 --> 00:22:44,799
so there's three sentences
 

1257
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,630
so there's three sentences
gato is not the end

1258
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:46,640
gato is not the end
 

1259
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,630
gato is not the end
gato is the beginning

1260
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:48,640
gato is the beginning
 

1261
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,870
gato is the beginning
meow cat emoji okay which is the

1262
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:50,880
meow cat emoji okay which is the
 

1263
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,029
meow cat emoji okay which is the
important part the meow no no

1264
00:22:53,029 --> 00:22:53,039
important part the meow no no
 

1265
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,990
important part the meow no no
definitely um that it is the beginning i

1266
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:56,000
definitely um that it is the beginning i
 

1267
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,270
definitely um that it is the beginning i
mean i i probably was just explaining um

1268
00:22:59,270 --> 00:22:59,280
mean i i probably was just explaining um
 

1269
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,230
mean i i probably was just explaining um
a bit

1270
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:00,240
a bit
 

1271
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,470
a bit
where the field is going but um let me

1272
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:02,480
where the field is going but um let me
 

1273
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,390
where the field is going but um let me
tell you about gato so

1274
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:04,400
tell you about gato so
 

1275
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,470
tell you about gato so
first the name gato

1276
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:06,480
first the name gato
 

1277
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,630
first the name gato
comes from maybe a sequence of releases

1278
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:08,640
comes from maybe a sequence of releases
 

1279
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,470
comes from maybe a sequence of releases
that deepmind had that

1280
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:10,480
that deepmind had that
 

1281
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,430
that deepmind had that
named uh like used animal names to name

1282
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:13,440
named uh like used animal names to name
 

1283
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,909
named uh like used animal names to name
some of their models that are based on

1284
00:23:15,909 --> 00:23:15,919
some of their models that are based on
 

1285
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,029
some of their models that are based on
this idea of large sequence models

1286
00:23:19,029 --> 00:23:19,039
this idea of large sequence models
 

1287
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,029
this idea of large sequence models
initially their only language but we're

1288
00:23:21,029 --> 00:23:21,039
initially their only language but we're
 

1289
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:24,310
initially their only language but we're
expanding to other modalities so we had

1290
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:24,320
expanding to other modalities so we had
 

1291
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,310
expanding to other modalities so we had
a you know we had

1292
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:26,320
a you know we had
 

1293
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,590
a you know we had
gopher

1294
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:27,600
gopher
 

1295
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,990
gopher
chinchilla these were language only and

1296
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:30,000
chinchilla these were language only and
 

1297
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,549
chinchilla these were language only and
then more recently we released flamingo

1298
00:23:32,549 --> 00:23:32,559
then more recently we released flamingo
 

1299
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:35,430
then more recently we released flamingo
which adds vision to the equation and

1300
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:35,440
which adds vision to the equation and
 

1301

00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:47,440
like up down left right
 

1311
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,029
like up down left right
i just told you the actions but they're

1312
00:23:49,029 --> 00:23:49,039
i just told you the actions but they're
 

1313
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,909
i just told you the actions but they're
words so you can kind of see how actions

1314
00:23:51,909 --> 00:23:51,919
words so you can kind of see how actions
 

1315
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:53,750
words so you can kind of see how actions
naturally map to sequence modeling of

1316
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:53,760
naturally map to sequence modeling of
 

1317
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,830
naturally map to sequence modeling of
words which these models are very

1318
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:55,840
words which these models are very
 

1319
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,950
words which these models are very
powerful

1320
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:56,960
powerful
 

1321
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,310
powerful
so

1322
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:58,320
so
 

1323
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,909
so
gato was named after i believe i can

1324
00:24:01,909 --> 00:24:01,919
gato was named after i believe i can
 

1325
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,710
gato was named after i believe i can
only from memory right this you know

1326
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:04,720
only from memory right this you know
 

1327
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,549
only from memory right this you know
these things always happen with an

1328
00:24:06,549 --> 00:24:06,559
these things always happen with an
 

1329
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:09,110
these things always happen with an
amazing team of researchers behind so

1330
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:09,120
amazing team of researchers behind so
 

1331
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,510
amazing team of researchers behind so
before the release yeah um we had a

1332
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:11,520
before the release yeah um we had a
 

1333
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,430
before the release yeah um we had a
discussion about which animal would we

1334
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:13,440
discussion about which animal would we
 

1335
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,990
discussion about which animal would we
pick right and i think because of the

1336
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:16,000
pick right and i think because of the
 

1337
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,190
pick right and i think because of the
word general agent right and and this is

1338
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:19,200
word general agent right and and this is
 

1339
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,310
word general agent right and and this is
a property quite unique to gato um we we

1340
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:22,320
a property quite unique to gato um we we
 

1341
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,630
a property quite unique to gato um we we
kind of were playing with the ga words

1342
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:24,640
kind of were playing with the ga words
 

1343
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,950
kind of were playing with the ga words
and then you know gato and rice of cat

1344
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:26,960
and then you know gato and rice of cat
 

1345
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,430
and then you know gato and rice of cat
yes um and gato is obviously a spanish

1346
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:29,440
yes um and gato is obviously a spanish
 

1347
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,190
yes um and gato is obviously a spanish
version of cat i had nothing to do with

1348
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:31,200
version of cat i had nothing to do with
 

1349
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,630
version of cat i had nothing to do with
it although i'm from spain

1350
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:32,640
it although i'm from spain
 

1351
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,630
it although i'm from spain
wait sorry how do you say cat in spanish

1352
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:34,640
wait sorry how do you say cat in spanish
 

1353
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,190
wait sorry how do you say cat in spanish
gato oh god okay yeah no okay okay i see

1354
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:37,200
gato oh god okay yeah no okay okay i see
 

1355
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,029
gato oh god okay yeah no okay okay i see
i see i see you now it all makes sense

1356
00:24:39,029 --> 00:24:39,039
i see i see you now it all makes sense
 

1357
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:40,870
i see i see you now it all makes sense
okay how do you say meow in spanish no

1358
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:40,880
okay how do you say meow in spanish no
 

1359
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,909
okay how do you say meow in spanish no
that's

1360
00:24:41,909 --> 00:24:41,919
that's
 

1361
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,230
that's
i think you you say it the same way

1362
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:44,240
i think you you say it the same way
 

1363
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,669
i think you you say it the same way
but you write it uh is

1364
00:24:46,669 --> 00:24:46,679
but you write it uh is
 

1365
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:49,350
but you write it uh is
m-i-a-u okay it's universal yeah all

1366
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:49,360
m-i-a-u okay it's universal yeah all
 

1367
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,669
m-i-a-u okay it's universal yeah all
right so then how does the thing work so

1368
00:24:51,669 --> 00:24:51,679
right so then how does the thing work so
 

1369
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:53,190
right so then how does the thing work so
you said general is

1370
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:53,200
you said general is
 

1371
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,310
you said general is
so you said uh language

1372
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:56,320
so you said uh language
 

1373
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,350
so you said uh language
vision

1374
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:57,360
vision
 

1375
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,190
vision
and action action

1376
00:24:59,190 --> 00:24:59,200
and action action
 

1377
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,789
and action action
how does this

1378
00:25:00,789 --> 00:25:00,799
how does this
 

1379
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,549
how does this
can you explain what kind of neural

1380
00:25:02,549 --> 00:25:02,559
can you explain what kind of neural
 

1381
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,710
can you explain what kind of neural
networks are involved what does the

1382
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:04,720
networks are involved what does the
 

1383
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,390
networks are involved what does the
training look like

1384
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:06,400
training look like
 

1385
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,630
training look like
maybe um

1386
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:08,640
maybe um
 

1387
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,110
maybe um
what you are some beautiful ideas within

1388
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:11,120
what you are some beautiful ideas within
 

1389
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,510
what you are some beautiful ideas within
the system yeah so

1390
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:13,520
the system yeah so
 

1391
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,190
the system yeah so
maybe the basics of gato are not that

1392
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:17,200
maybe the basics of gato are not that
 

1393
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,510
maybe the basics of gato are not that
dissimilar from many many work that

1394
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:19,520
dissimilar from many many work that
 

1395
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,590
dissimilar from many many work that
comes so here is where the the sort of

1396
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:21,600
comes so here is where the the sort of
 

1397
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,750
comes so here is where the the sort of
the recipe i mean hasn't changed too

1398
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:23,760
the recipe i mean hasn't changed too
 

1399
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,669
the recipe i mean hasn't changed too
much there is a transformer model that's

1400
00:25:25,669 --> 00:25:25,679
much there is a transformer model that's
 

1401
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,590
much there is a transformer model that's
just the kind of recurrent neural

1402
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:27,600
just the kind of recurrent neural
 

1403
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,549
just the kind of recurrent neural
network

1404
00:25:28,549 --> 00:25:28,559
network
 

1405
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:32,390
network
that essentially takes a sequence of

1406
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:32,400
that essentially takes a sequence of
 

1407
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,830
that essentially takes a sequence of
modalities observations that could be

1408
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:35,840
modalities observations that could be
 

1409
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,909
modalities observations that could be
words could be vision or could be

1410
00:25:37,909 --> 00:25:37,919
words could be vision or could be
 

1411
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:39,590
words could be vision or could be
actions and then

1412
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:39,600
actions and then
 

1413
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,669
actions and then
its own objective that you train it to

1414
00:25:41,669 --> 00:25:41,679
its own objective that you train it to
 

1415
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:44,230
its own objective that you train it to
do when you train it is to predict what

1416
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:44,240
do when you train it is to predict what
 

1417
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,510
do when you train it is to predict what
the next

1418
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:45,520
the next
 

1419
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,669
the next
anything is and anything means what's

1420
00:25:47,669 --> 00:25:47,679
anything is and anything means what's
 

1421
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,070
anything is and anything means what's
the next action if this sequence that

1422
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:50,080
the next action if this sequence that
 

1423
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,750
the next action if this sequence that
i'm showing you to train is a sequence

1424
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:51,760
i'm showing you to train is a sequence
 

1425
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,750
i'm showing you to train is a sequence
of actions and observations then you're

1426
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:53,760
of actions and observations then you're
 

1427
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,669
of actions and observations then you're
predicting what's the next action and

1428
00:25:55,669 --> 00:25:55,679
predicting what's the next action and
 

1429
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,590
predicting what's the next action and
the next observation right so you you

1430
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:57,600
the next observation right so you you
 

1431
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,990
the next observation right so you you
think of of this really as a sequence of

1432
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:00,000
think of of this really as a sequence of
 

1433
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,350
think of of this really as a sequence of
bytes right so take any sequence um of

1434
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:03,360
bytes right so take any sequence um of
 

1435
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,750
bytes right so take any sequence um of
words a sequence of interleaved words

1436
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:05,760
words a sequence of interleaved words
 

1437
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,430
words a sequence of interleaved words
and images a sequence of um maybe um

1438
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:09,440
and images a sequence of um maybe um
 

1439
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,149
and images a sequence of um maybe um
observations that are images and moves

1440
00:26:12,149 --> 00:26:12,159
observations that are images and moves
 

1441
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:14,870
observations that are images and moves
in atari up down left right and these

1442
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:14,880
in atari up down left right and these
 

1443
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,990
in atari up down left right and these
you just

1444
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:16,000
you just
 

1445
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,909
you just
think of them as bytes and you're

1446
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:17,919
think of them as bytes and you're
 

1447
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:19,909
think of them as bytes and you're
modeling what's the next byte gonna be

1448
00:26:19,909 --> 00:26:19,919
modeling what's the next byte gonna be
 

1449
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,230
modeling what's the next byte gonna be
like and you might interpret that as an

1450
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:22,240
like and you might interpret that as an
 

1451
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,029
like and you might interpret that as an
action as an action and then play it in

1452
00:26:25,029 --> 00:26:25,039
action as an action and then play it in
 

1453
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,110
action as an action and then play it in
a game or you could interpret it as a

1454
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:27,120
a game or you could interpret it as a
 

1455
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,430
a game or you could interpret it as a
word and then write it down if you're

1456
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:29,440
word and then write it down if you're
 

1457
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,310
word and then write it down if you're
chatting with the system and so on um

1458
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:32,320
chatting with the system and so on um
 

1459
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,070
chatting with the system and so on um
so gato basically

1460
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:34,080
so gato basically
 

1461
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,549
so gato basically
can be but can be thought as inputs

1462
00:26:36,549 --> 00:26:36,559
can be but can be thought as inputs
 

1463
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:37,750
can be but can be thought as inputs

actions
 

1471
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,149
actions
it also actually inputs some sort of

1472
00:26:44,149 --> 00:26:44,159
it also actually inputs some sort of
 

1473
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,390
it also actually inputs some sort of
proprioception sensors from robotics

1474
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:46,400
proprioception sensors from robotics
 

1475
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,149
proprioception sensors from robotics
because robotics is one of the tasks

1476
00:26:48,149 --> 00:26:48,159
because robotics is one of the tasks
 

1477
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:50,149
because robotics is one of the tasks
that it's been trained to do and then at

1478
00:26:50,149 --> 00:26:50,159
that it's been trained to do and then at
 

1479
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:52,789
that it's been trained to do and then at
the output similarly it outputs words

1480
00:26:52,789 --> 00:26:52,799
the output similarly it outputs words
 

1481
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:55,590
the output similarly it outputs words
actions it does not output images um

1482
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:55,600
actions it does not output images um
 

1483
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,549
actions it does not output images um
that's just by design we decided not to

1484
00:26:58,549 --> 00:26:58,559
that's just by design we decided not to
 

1485
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:01,510
that's just by design we decided not to
go that way for now um that's also in

1486
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:01,520
go that way for now um that's also in
 

1487
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,870
go that way for now um that's also in
part why it's the beginning because

1488
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:02,880
part why it's the beginning because
 

1489
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,710
part why it's the beginning because
there's more to do clearly

1490
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:04,720
there's more to do clearly
 

1491
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,470
there's more to do clearly
but that's kind of what the gato is is

1492
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:06,480
but that's kind of what the gato is is
 

1493
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,390
but that's kind of what the gato is is
this brain that essentially you give it

1494
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:08,400
this brain that essentially you give it
 

1495
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,029
this brain that essentially you give it
any sequence of these observations and

1496
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:11,039
any sequence of these observations and
 

1497
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:13,029
any sequence of these observations and
and modalities and it outputs the next

1498
00:27:13,029 --> 00:27:13,039
and modalities and it outputs the next
 

1499
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:15,830
and modalities and it outputs the next
step and then you off you go you fit the

1500
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:15,840
step and then you off you go you fit the
 

1501
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,230
step and then you off you go you fit the
next the next step into and predict the

1502
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:18,240
next the next step into and predict the
 

1503
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,190
next the next step into and predict the
next one and so on now

1504
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:21,200
next one and so on now
 

1505
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,549
next one and so on now
it is

1506
00:27:22,549 --> 00:27:22,559
it is
 

1507
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:25,110
it is
more than a language model because even

1508
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:25,120
more than a language model because even
 

1509
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,950
more than a language model because even
though you can chat with gato like you

1510
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:26,960
though you can chat with gato like you
 

1511
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,389
though you can chat with gato like you
can chat with chinchilla or flamingo um

1512
00:27:30,389 --> 00:27:30,399
can chat with chinchilla or flamingo um
 

1513
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:31,909
can chat with chinchilla or flamingo um
it also

1514
00:27:31,909 --> 00:27:31,919
it also
 

1515
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,389
it also
is an agent right so that's

1516
00:27:34,389 --> 00:27:34,399
is an agent right so that's
 

1517
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:37,669
is an agent right so that's
why we call it a of gato like the the

1518
00:27:37,669 --> 00:27:37,679
why we call it a of gato like the the
 

1519
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:39,990
why we call it a of gato like the the
word uh the letter a and also it's

1520
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:40,000
word uh the letter a and also it's
 

1521
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,389
word uh the letter a and also it's
general um it's not an agent that's been

1522
00:27:42,389 --> 00:27:42,399
general um it's not an agent that's been
 

1523
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:45,669
general um it's not an agent that's been
trained to be good at only starcraft or

1524
00:27:45,669 --> 00:27:45,679
trained to be good at only starcraft or
 

1525
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:48,389
trained to be good at only starcraft or
only atari or only go it's been trained

1526
00:27:48,389 --> 00:27:48,399
only atari or only go it's been trained
 

1527
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:51,510
only atari or only go it's been trained
on a vast variety of data sets so

1528
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:51,520
on a vast variety of data sets so
 

1529
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,669
on a vast variety of data sets so
what makes an agent if i may interrupt

1530
00:27:53,669 --> 00:27:53,679
what makes an agent if i may interrupt
 

1531
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:55,909
what makes an agent if i may interrupt
the fact that it can generate actions

1532
00:27:55,909 --> 00:27:55,919
the fact that it can generate actions
 

1533
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:57,190
the fact that it can generate actions
yes so

1534
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:57,200
yes so
 

1535
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,029
yes so
when we call it i mean it's a it's a

1536
00:27:59,029 --> 00:27:59,039
when we call it i mean it's a it's a
 

1537
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:01,350
when we call it i mean it's a it's a
good question right what why when do we

1538
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:01,360
good question right what why when do we
 

1539
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,350
good question right what why when do we
call a model i mean everything is a

1540
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:03,360
call a model i mean everything is a
 

1541
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,230
call a model i mean everything is a
model but what is an agent in my view is

1542
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:06,240
model but what is an agent in my view is
 

1543
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,389
model but what is an agent in my view is
indeed the capacity to take actions in

1544
00:28:08,389 --> 00:28:08,399
indeed the capacity to take actions in
 

1545
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:11,510
indeed the capacity to take actions in
an environment that you then send to it

1546
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:11,520
an environment that you then send to it
 

1547
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,350
an environment that you then send to it
and then the environment might return

1548
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:13,360
and then the environment might return
 

1549
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,990
and then the environment might return
with a new observation um and then you

1550
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:16,000
with a new observation um and then you
 

1551
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,669
with a new observation um and then you
generate the next action this this

1552
00:28:17,669 --> 00:28:17,679
generate the next action this this
 

1553
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:20,230
generate the next action this this
actually this reminds me of the question

1554
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:20,240
actually this reminds me of the question
 

1555
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,789
actually this reminds me of the question
from the side of biology what is life

1556
00:28:22,789 --> 00:28:22,799
from the side of biology what is life
 

1557
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:24,230
from the side of biology what is life
which is actually a very difficult

1558
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:24,240
which is actually a very difficult
 

1559
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,630
which is actually a very difficult
question as well what is living

1560
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:26,640
question as well what is living
 

1561
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,110
question as well what is living
what is living when you think about life

1562
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:29,120
what is living when you think about life
 

1563
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,430
what is living when you think about life
here on this planet earth and a question

1564
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:31,440
here on this planet earth and a question
 

1565
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,750
here on this planet earth and a question
interesting to me about aliens what is

1566
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:33,760
interesting to me about aliens what is
 

1567
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,750
interesting to me about aliens what is
life when we visit another planet would

1568
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:35,760
life when we visit another planet would
 

1569
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,430
life when we visit another planet would
we be able to recognize it and this

1570
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:37,440
we be able to recognize it and this
 

1571
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,310
we be able to recognize it and this
feels like it sounds perhaps silly but i

1572
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:40,320
feels like it sounds perhaps silly but i
 

1573
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,149
feels like it sounds perhaps silly but i
don't think it is at which point is the

1574
00:28:42,149 --> 00:28:42,159
don't think it is at which point is the
 

1575
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:43,669
don't think it is at which point is the
neural network

1576
00:28:43,669 --> 00:28:43,679
neural network
 

1577
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:45,269
neural network
a being

1578
00:28:45,269 --> 00:28:45,279
a being
 

1579
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:48,149
a being
versus a tool

1580
00:28:48,149 --> 00:28:48,159
versus a tool
 

1581
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,630
versus a tool
and it feels like action ability to

1582
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:50,640
and it feels like action ability to
 

1583
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,630
and it feels like action ability to
modify its environment as that

1584
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:52,640
modify its environment as that
 

1585
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,389
modify its environment as that
fundamental leap

1586
00:28:54,389 --> 00:28:54,399
fundamental leap
 

1587
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,630
fundamental leap
yeah i think it's it certainly feels

1588
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:56,640
yeah i think it's it certainly feels
 

1589
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,149
yeah i think it's it certainly feels
like action is a necessary condition to

1590
00:29:00,149 --> 00:29:00,159
like action is a necessary condition to
 

1591
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:01,110
like action is a necessary condition to
to be

1592
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:01,120
to be
 

1593
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,269
to be
more alive but probably not sufficient

1594
00:29:03,269 --> 00:29:03,279
more alive but probably not sufficient
 

1595
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:06,070
more alive but probably not sufficient
either um yeah so sadly consciousness

1596
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:06,080
either um yeah so sadly consciousness
 

1597
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,830
either um yeah so sadly consciousness
thing whatever yeah yeah we can get back

1598
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:07,840
thing whatever yeah yeah we can get back
 

1599
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,149
thing whatever yeah yeah we can get back
to that later but anyways going back to

1600
00:29:10,149 --> 00:29:10,159
to that later but anyways going back to
 

1601
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:13,029
to that later but anyways going back to
the meow and the legato right so

1602
00:29:13,029 --> 00:29:13,039
the meow and the legato right so
 

1603
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:13,909
the meow and the legato right so
um

1604
00:29:13,909 --> 00:29:13,919
um
 

1605
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,190
um
one of the

1606
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:15,200
one of the
 

1607
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,269
one of the
leaps forward and what took the team a

1608
00:29:17,269 --> 00:29:17,279
leaps forward and what took the team a
 

1609
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:19,350
leaps forward and what took the team a
lot of effort and time was

1610
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:19,360
lot of effort and time was
 

1611
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,190
lot of effort and time was
um as you were asking

1612
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:21,200
um as you were asking
 

1613
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,669
um as you were asking
how has gato been trained so i told you

1614
00:29:23,669 --> 00:29:23,679
how has gato been trained so i told you
 

1615
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,909
how has gato been trained so i told you
gato is this transformer neural network

1616
00:29:25,909 --> 00:29:25,919
gato is this transformer neural network
 

1617
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:27,750
gato is this transformer neural network
models actions um

1618
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:27,760
models actions um
 

1619
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,710
models actions um
sequences of actions words etc

1620
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:30,720
sequences of actions words etc
 

1621
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,149
sequences of actions words etc
and then the way we train it is by

1622
00:29:34,149 --> 00:29:34,159
and then the way we train it is by
 

1623
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:36,710
and then the way we train it is by
essentially pulling data sets

1624
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:36,720
essentially pulling data sets
 

1625
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,750
essentially pulling data sets
of

1626
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:37,760
of
 

1627
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,070
of
um observations right so it's a massive

1628
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:40,080
um observations right so it's a massive
 

1629
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,110
um observations right so it's a massive
imitation learning algorithm that it it

1630
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:43,120
imitation learning algorithm that it it
 

1631
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,870
imitation learning algorithm that it it
imitates obviously to

1632
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:44,880
imitates obviously to
 

1633
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,269
imitates obviously to
what is the next word that comes next

1634
00:29:47,269 --> 00:29:47,279
what is the next word that comes next
 

1635
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:49,750
what is the next word that comes next
from the usual data sets we used before

1636
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:49,760
from the usual data sets we used before
 

1637
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,990
from the usual data sets we used before
right so these these are these web scale

1638
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:52,000
right so these these are these web scale
 

1639
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,110
right so these these are these web scale
style data sets of people um writing you

1640
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:55,120
style data sets of people um writing you
 

1641
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:55,830
style data sets of people um writing you
know

1642
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:55,840
know
 

1643
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,310
know
on on webs or chatting or whatnot right

1644
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:58,320
on on webs or chatting or whatnot right
 

1645
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,389
on on webs or chatting or whatnot right
so that's an obvious source that we use

1646
00:30:00,389 --> 00:30:00,399
so that's an obvious source that we use
 

1647
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,870
so that's an obvious source that we use
on all language work but then

1648
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:02,880
on all language work but then
 

1649
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,830
on all language work but then
we also took a lot of agents that we

1650
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:05,840
we also took a lot of agents that we
 

1651
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,110
we also took a lot of agents that we
have at deepmind i mean as you know

1652
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:07,120
have at deepmind i mean as you know
 

1653
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,430
have at deepmind i mean as you know
deepmind we're quite um

1654
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:09,440
deepmind we're quite um
 

1655
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,029
deepmind we're quite um
you know we're quite interested in

1656
00:30:11,029 --> 00:30:11,039
you know we're quite interested in
 

1657
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:13,669
you know we're quite interested in
learning um reinforcement learning and

1658
00:30:13,669 --> 00:30:13,679
learning um reinforcement learning and
 

1659
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,990
learning um reinforcement learning and
learning agents that play in different

1660
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:16,000
learning agents that play in different
 

1661
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,789
learning agents that play in different
environments so we kind of created a

1662
00:30:18,789 --> 00:30:18,799
environments so we kind of created a
 

1663
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:20,870
environments so we kind of created a
data set of these trajectories as we

1664
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:20,880
data set of these trajectories as we
 

1665
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,430
data set of these trajectories as we
call them or asian experiences so in a

1666
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:23,440
call them or asian experiences so in a
 

1667
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,909
call them or asian experiences so in a
way there are other agents we train for

1668
00:30:25,909 --> 00:30:25,919
way there are other agents we train for
 

1669
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:29,110
way there are other agents we train for
a single mind purpose to let's say um

1670
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:29,120
a single mind purpose to let's say um
 

1671
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,830
a single mind purpose to let's say um
you know control a 3d game environment

1672
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:31,840
you know control a 3d game environment
 

1673
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,230
you know control a 3d game environment
and navigate a maze so we had all the

1674
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:34,240
and navigate a maze so we had all the
 

1675
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,950
and navigate a maze so we had all the
experience that was created through the

1676
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:36,960
experience that was created through the
 

1677
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,389
experience that was created through the
one agent interacting with that

1678
00:30:38,389 --> 00:30:38,399
one agent interacting with that
 

1679
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:40,470
one agent interacting with that
environment and we added this to the

1680
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:40,480
environment and we added this to the
 

1681
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,510
environment and we added this to the
data set right and as i said we just see

1682
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:43,520
data set right and as i said we just see
 

1683
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,350
data set right and as i said we just see
all the data all these sequences of

1684
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:45,360
all the data all these sequences of
 

1685
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,430
all the data all these sequences of
words or sequences of this agent

1686
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:47,440
words or sequences of this agent
 

1687
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,590
words or sequences of this agent
interacting with that environment

1688
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:49,600
interacting with that environment
 

1689
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,830
interacting with that environment
or you know agents playing atari and so

1690
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:51,840
or you know agents playing atari and so
 

1691
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,710
or you know agents playing atari and so
on we see this as the same kind of data

1692
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:54,720
on we see this as the same kind of data
 

1693
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,350
on we see this as the same kind of data
and so we mix these data sets together

1694
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:57,360
and so we mix these data sets together
 

1695
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,070
and so we mix these data sets together
and we train gato

1696
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:00,080
and we train gato
 

1697
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,070
and we train gato
that's the g part right it's general

1698
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:02,080
that's the g part right it's general
 

1699
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,190
that's the g part right it's general
because it really has mixed it it

1700
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:05,200
because it really has mixed it it
 

1701
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,710
because it really has mixed it it
doesn't have different brains for each

1702
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:06,720
doesn't have different brains for each
 

1703
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,430
doesn't have different brains for each
modality or each narrow task it has a

1704
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:09,440
modality or each narrow task it has a
 

1705
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,190
modality or each narrow task it has a
single brain it's not that big of a

1706
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:11,200
single brain it's not that big of a
 

1707
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,029
single brain it's not that big of a
brain compared to most of the neural

1708
00:31:13,029 --> 00:31:13,039
brain compared to most of the neural
 

1709
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:15,669
brain compared to most of the neural
networks we see these days it has one

1710
00:31:15,669 --> 00:31:15,679
networks we see these days it has one
 

1711
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:18,149
networks we see these days it has one
billion parameters

1712
00:31:18,149 --> 00:31:18,159
billion parameters
 

1713
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:19,909
billion parameters
some models we're seeing get in the

1714
00:31:19,909 --> 00:31:19,919
some models we're seeing get in the
 

1715
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,149
some models we're seeing get in the
trillions these days and certainly 100

1716
00:31:22,149 --> 00:31:22,159
trillions these days and certainly 100
 

1717
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,470
trillions these days and certainly 100
billion feels like um

1718
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:24,480
billion feels like um
 

1719
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,190
billion feels like um
a size that is very common from from

1720
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:27,200
a size that is very common from from
 

1721
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,669
a size that is very common from from
when you train this this job so the

1722
00:31:29,669 --> 00:31:29,679
when you train this this job so the
 

1723
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:30,710
when you train this this job so the
actual

1724
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:30,720
actual
 

1725
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,029
actual
agent is relatively small but it's been

1726
00:31:33,029 --> 00:31:33,039
agent is relatively small but it's been
 

1727
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:35,509
agent is relatively small but it's been
trained on on a very challenging diverse

1728
00:31:35,509 --> 00:31:35,519
trained on on a very challenging diverse
 

1729
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,350
trained on on a very challenging diverse
data set not only containing all of

1730
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:37,360
data set not only containing all of
 

1731
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,350
data set not only containing all of
internet but containing all these asian

1732
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:39,360
internet but containing all these asian
 

1733
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,269
internet but containing all these asian
experience playing very different

1734
00:31:41,269 --> 00:31:41,279
experience playing very different
 

1735
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,029
experience playing very different
distinct environments

1736
00:31:43,029 --> 00:31:43,039
distinct environments
 

1737
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:44,470
distinct environments
so this

1738
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:44,480
so this
 

1739
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,310
so this
brings us to the part of the tweet of

1740
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:46,320
brings us to the part of the tweet of
 

1741
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,110
brings us to the part of the tweet of
this is not the end is the beginning it

1742
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:49,120
this is not the end is the beginning it
 

1743
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,149
this is not the end is the beginning it
it feels very cool to see gato

1744
00:31:52,149 --> 00:31:52,159
it feels very cool to see gato
 

1745
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:54,710
it feels very cool to see gato
in principle is able to control

1746
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:54,720
in principle is able to control
 

1747
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,710
in principle is able to control
any sort of environments um that

1748
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:56,720
any sort of environments um that
 

1749
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,070
any sort of environments um that
especially the ones that it's been

1750
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:58,080
especially the ones that it's been
 

1751
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,710
especially the ones that it's been
trained to do these 3d games atari games

1752
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:00,720
trained to do these 3d games atari games
 

1753
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,350
trained to do these 3d games atari games
and all sorts of robotics tasks and so

1754
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:03,360
and all sorts of robotics tasks and so
 

1755
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,149
and all sorts of robotics tasks and so
on

1756
00:32:04,149 --> 00:32:04,159
on
 

1757
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:05,430
on
um but

1758
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:05,440
um but
 

1759
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,389
um but
obviously it's not as proficient as the

1760
00:32:08,389 --> 00:32:08,399
obviously it's not as proficient as the
 

1761
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:10,070
obviously it's not as proficient as the
teachers it learned from on these

1762
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:10,080
teachers it learned from on these
 

1763
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,830
teachers it learned from on these
environments not obvious

1764
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:11,840
environments not obvious
 

1765
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,509
environments not obvious
it's not obvious that it wouldn't be

1766
00:32:13,509 --> 00:32:13,519
it's not obvious that it wouldn't be
 

1767
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:15,029
it's not obvious that it wouldn't be
more proficient

1768
00:32:15,029 --> 00:32:15,039
more proficient
 

1769
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:17,590
more proficient
it's just the current beginning part

1770
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:17,600
it's just the current beginning part
 

1771
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,190
it's just the current beginning part
right is that

1772
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:19,200
right is that
 

1773
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,430
right is that
the performance is such that it's not as

1774
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:21,440
the performance is such that it's not as
 

1775
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,350
the performance is such that it's not as
good as if it's specialized to that task

1776
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:23,360
good as if it's specialized to that task
 

1777
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,389
good as if it's specialized to that task
right so

1778
00:32:24,389 --> 00:32:24,399
right so
 

1779
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:26,870
right so
it's not as good although i would argue

1780
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:26,880
it's not as good although i would argue
 

1781
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,110
it's not as good although i would argue
size matters here so the fact that i

1782
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:29,120
size matters here so the fact that i
 

1783
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,110
size matters here so the fact that i
would argue always size always matter

1784
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:31,120
would argue always size always matter
 

1785
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,269
would argue always size always matter
yeah that's a different color

1786
00:32:33,269 --> 00:32:33,279
yeah that's a different color
 

1787
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:35,110
yeah that's a different color
but but for neural networks certainly

1788
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:35,120
but but for neural networks certainly
 

1789
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,590
but but for neural networks certainly
size does matter so um it's the

1790
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:37,600
size does matter so um it's the
 

1791
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,590
size does matter so um it's the
beginning because it's relatively small

1792
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:39,600
beginning because it's relatively small
 

1793
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,710
beginning because it's relatively small
so obviously scaling this idea up um

1794
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:42,720
so obviously scaling this idea up um
 

1795
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,149
so obviously scaling this idea up um
might make

1796
00:32:44,149 --> 00:32:44,159
might make
 

1797
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:45,029
might make
the

1798
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:45,039
the
 

1799
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:47,509
the
connections that exist between

1800
00:32:47,509 --> 00:32:47,519
connections that exist between
 

1801
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:48,950
connections that exist between
you know text on the internet and

1802
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:48,960
you know text on the internet and
 

1803
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,509
you know text on the internet and
playing atari and so on more

1804
00:32:51,509 --> 00:32:51,519
playing atari and so on more
 

1805
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:53,590
playing atari and so on more
synergistic with one another and you

1806
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:53,600
synergistic with one another and you
 

1807
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,669
synergistic with one another and you
might gain and that moment we didn't

1808
00:32:55,669 --> 00:32:55,679
might gain and that moment we didn't
 

1809
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:58,070
might gain and that moment we didn't
quite see but obviously that's why it's

1810
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:58,080
quite see but obviously that's why it's
 

1811
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,070
quite see but obviously that's why it's
the beginning that synergy might emerge

1812
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:00,080
the beginning that synergy might emerge
 

1813
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,070
the beginning that synergy might emerge
with scale right my emerge with scale

1814
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:02,080
with scale right my emerge with scale
 

1815
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,830
with scale right my emerge with scale
and also i believe there's some new

1816
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:03,840
and also i believe there's some new
 

1817
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,909
and also i believe there's some new
research or ways in which you prepare

1818
00:33:05,909 --> 00:33:05,919
research or ways in which you prepare
 

1819
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:09,190
research or ways in which you prepare
the data um that might you might need to

1820
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:09,200
the data um that might you might need to
 

1821
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,509
the data um that might you might need to
sort of make it more clear to the model

1822
00:33:11,509 --> 00:33:11,519
sort of make it more clear to the model
 

1823
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:12,389
sort of make it more clear to the model
that

1824
00:33:12,389 --> 00:33:12,399
that
 

1825
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:14,549
that
you're not only playing atari and it's

1826
00:33:14,549 --> 00:33:14,559
you're not only playing atari and it's
 

1827
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:17,029
you're not only playing atari and it's
just you start from a screen and here is

1828
00:33:17,029 --> 00:33:17,039
just you start from a screen and here is
 

1829
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,430
just you start from a screen and here is
up and a screen and down maybe you can

1830
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:19,440
up and a screen and down maybe you can
 

1831
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,430
up and a screen and down maybe you can
think of playing atari as there's some

1832
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:21,440
think of playing atari as there's some
 

1833
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,269
think of playing atari as there's some
sort of context that is needed for the

1834
00:33:23,269 --> 00:33:23,279
sort of context that is needed for the
 

1835
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:25,750
sort of context that is needed for the
agent before it starts seeing oh i'm

1836
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:25,760
agent before it starts seeing oh i'm
 

1837
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,110
agent before it starts seeing oh i'm
this is an entire screen i'm going to

1838
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:27,120
this is an entire screen i'm going to
 

1839
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,230
this is an entire screen i'm going to
start playing

1840
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:28,240
start playing
 

1841
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,110
start playing
um you might require for instance to to

1842
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:31,120
um you might require for instance to to
 

1843
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,269
um you might require for instance to to
be told in words

1844
00:33:33,269 --> 00:33:33,279
be told in words
 

1845
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:35,750
be told in words
hey this is the in this in this sequence

1846
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:35,760
hey this is the in this in this sequence
 

1847
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,190
hey this is the in this in this sequence
that i'm showing you're going to be

1848
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:37,200
that i'm showing you're going to be
 

1849
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,029
that i'm showing you're going to be
playing an entire game

1850
00:33:39,029 --> 00:33:39,039
playing an entire game
 

1851
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:41,909
playing an entire game
so text might actually be a good driver

1852
00:33:41,909 --> 00:33:41,919
so text might actually be a good driver
 

1853
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:42,630
so text might actually be a good driver
to

1854
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:42,640
to
 

1855
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,950
to
enhance the data right so then these

1856
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:44,960
enhance the data right so then these
 

1857
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,630
enhance the data right so then these
connections might be made more easily

1858
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:46,640
connections might be made more easily
 

1859
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,029
connections might be made more easily
right that's that's an idea that we

1860
00:33:49,029 --> 00:33:49,039
right that's that's an idea that we
 

1861
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:50,230
right that's that's an idea that we
start seeing

1862
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:50,240
start seeing
 

1863
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,870
start seeing
in language but you know obviously

1864
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:52,880
in language but you know obviously
 

1865
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,710
in language but you know obviously
beyond this is going to be effective

1866
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:54,720
beyond this is going to be effective
 

1867
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,630
beyond this is going to be effective
right it's not like i don't show you a

1868
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:56,640
right it's not like i don't show you a
 

1869
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,669
right it's not like i don't show you a
screen and and you from from scratch you

1870
00:33:59,669 --> 00:33:59,679
screen and and you from from scratch you
 

1871
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:01,190
screen and and you from from scratch you
you're supposed to learn a game there is

1872
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:01,200
you're supposed to learn a game there is
 

1873
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,669
you're supposed to learn a game there is
a lot of context we might set so there

1874
00:34:03,669 --> 00:34:03,679
a lot of context we might set so there
 

1875
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:05,430
a lot of context we might set so there
are there might be some work needed as

1876
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:05,440
are there might be some work needed as
 

1877
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,950
are there might be some work needed as
well to set that context um but

1878
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:08,960
well to set that context um but
 

1879
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,710
well to set that context um but
anyways there's a lot of work yeah so

1880
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:10,720
anyways there's a lot of work yeah so
 

1881
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,710
anyways there's a lot of work yeah so
that context puts all the different

1882
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:12,720
that context puts all the different
 

1883
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,869
that context puts all the different
modalities on the same level ground

1884
00:34:14,869 --> 00:34:14,879
modalities on the same level ground
 

1885
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:16,629
modalities on the same level ground
exactly provide the context best so

1886
00:34:16,629 --> 00:34:16,639
exactly provide the context best so
 

1887
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:20,069
exactly provide the context best so
maybe on that point uh so there's this

1888
00:34:20,069 --> 00:34:20,079
maybe on that point uh so there's this
 

1889
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:21,349
maybe on that point uh so there's this
task which

1890
00:34:21,349 --> 00:34:21,359
task which
 

1891
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,990
task which
may not seem trivial of

1892
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:24,000
may not seem trivial of
 

1893
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,230
may not seem trivial of
tokenizing the data of converting the

1894
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:26,240
tokenizing the data of converting the
 

1895
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,430
tokenizing the data of converting the
data into

1896
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:27,440
data into
 

1897
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,270
data into
pieces into basic atomic elements

1898
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:31,280
pieces into basic atomic elements
 

1899
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,270
pieces into basic atomic elements
that then could uh

1900
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:33,280
that then could uh
 

1901
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,230
that then could uh
cross modalities somehow so what's

1902
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:36,240
cross modalities somehow so what's
 

1903
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,750
cross modalities somehow so what's
tokenization

1904
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:37,760
tokenization
 

1905
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,990
tokenization
how do you tokenize text how do you

1906
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:40,000
how do you tokenize text how do you
 

1907
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,589
how do you tokenize text how do you
tokenize images how do you tokenize

1908
00:34:43,589 --> 00:34:43,599
tokenize images how do you tokenize
 

1909
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:46,470
tokenize images how do you tokenize
games and actions and robotics

1910
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:46,480
games and actions and robotics
 

1911
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:50,069
games and actions and robotics
tasks yeah that's a great question so

1912
00:34:50,069 --> 00:34:50,079
tasks yeah that's a great question so
 

1913
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:51,669
tasks yeah that's a great question so
tokenization is

1914
00:34:51,669 --> 00:34:51,679
tokenization is
 

1915
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:54,230
tokenization is
the entry point to actually make all the

1916
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:54,240
the entry point to actually make all the
 

1917
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,389
the entry point to actually make all the
data look like a sequence because tokens

1918
00:34:56,389 --> 00:34:56,399
data look like a sequence because tokens
 

1919
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:58,150
data look like a sequence because tokens
then are just kind of these little

1920
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:58,160
then are just kind of these little
 

1921
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,470
then are just kind of these little
puzzle pieces we break down anything

1922
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:00,480
puzzle pieces we break down anything
 

1923
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,310
puzzle pieces we break down anything
into these puzzle pieces and then we

1924
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:02,320
into these puzzle pieces and then we
 

1925
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,630
into these puzzle pieces and then we
just model what's the what's this puzzle

1926
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:04,640
just model what's the what's this puzzle
 

1927
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,550
just model what's the what's this puzzle
look like right when you make it you

1928
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:06,560
look like right when you make it you
 

1929
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,390
look like right when you make it you
know lay down in a line so to speak in a

1930
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:08,400
know lay down in a line so to speak in a
 

1931
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,430
know lay down in a line so to speak in a
sequence

1932
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:09,440
sequence
 

1933
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,230
sequence
so

1934
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:10,240
so
 

1935
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:13,109
so
in gato um

1936
00:35:13,109 --> 00:35:13,119
in gato um
 

1937
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:15,510
in gato um
the text there's a lot of work you

1938
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:15,520
the text there's a lot of work you
 

1939
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,430
the text there's a lot of work you
tokenize text usually by looking at

1940
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:17,440
tokenize text usually by looking at
 

1941
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,910
tokenize text usually by looking at
common commonly used sub strings right

1942
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:19,920
common commonly used sub strings right
 

1943
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,550
common commonly used sub strings right
so there's you know ing in english is a

1944
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:22,560
so there's you know ing in english is a
 

1945
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,310
so there's you know ing in english is a
very common substring so that becomes a

1946
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:24,320
very common substring so that becomes a
 

1947
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,950
very common substring so that becomes a
token um there's quite well studied

1948
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:26,960
token um there's quite well studied
 

1949
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,510
token um there's quite well studied
problem on tokenizing text text and gato

1950
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:29,520
problem on tokenizing text text and gato
 

1951
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,670
problem on tokenizing text text and gato
just used the standard techniques that

1952
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:31,680
just used the standard techniques that
 

1953
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,550
just used the standard techniques that
have been developed from many years even

1954
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:34,560
have been developed from many years even
 

1955
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,349
have been developed from many years even
starting from engram models in the 1950s

1956
00:35:37,349 --> 00:35:37,359
starting from engram models in the 1950s
 

1957
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:39,190
starting from engram models in the 1950s
and so on just for context how many

1958
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:39,200
and so on just for context how many
 

1959
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,990
and so on just for context how many
tokens like what order magnitude number

1960
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:42,000
tokens like what order magnitude number
 

1961
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,390
tokens like what order magnitude number
of tokens is required for a word

1962
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:44,400
of tokens is required for a word
 

1963
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,150
of tokens is required for a word
yeah actually what are we talking about

1964
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:46,160
yeah actually what are we talking about
 

1965
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,550
yeah actually what are we talking about
yeah for a word in in english right i

1966
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:48,560
yeah for a word in in english right i
 

1967
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,030
yeah for a word in in english right i
mean every language is very different um

1968
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:51,040
mean every language is very different um
 

1969
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,870
mean every language is very different um
the current level or granularity of

1970
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:52,880
the current level or granularity of
 

1971
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,950
the current level or granularity of
tokenization generally

1972
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:54,960
tokenization generally
 

1973
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,950
tokenization generally
means is maybe

1974
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:56,960
means is maybe
 

1975
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,030
means is maybe
two to five i mean i i don't know the

1976
00:35:59,030 --> 00:35:59,040
two to five i mean i i don't know the
 

1977
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,030
two to five i mean i i don't know the
statistics exactly but to give you an

1978
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:01,040
statistics exactly but to give you an
 

1979
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,349
statistics exactly but to give you an
idea um we don't tokenize at the level

1980
00:36:03,349 --> 00:36:03,359
idea um we don't tokenize at the level
 

1981
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:05,190
idea um we don't tokenize at the level
of letters then it would probably be

1982
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:05,200
of letters then it would probably be
 

1983
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,310
of letters then it would probably be
like i don't know what the average

1984
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:06,320
like i don't know what the average
 

1985
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,069
like i don't know what the average
length of of a word is in english but

1986
00:36:08,069 --> 00:36:08,079
length of of a word is in english but
 

1987
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:09,990
length of of a word is in english but
that would be you know the the minimum

1988
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:10,000
that would be you know the the minimum
 

1989
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,750
that would be you know the the minimum
set of tokens you could use was bigger

1990
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:11,760
set of tokens you could use was bigger
 

1991
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,829
set of tokens you could use was bigger
than letters smaller than words yes yes

1992
00:36:13,829 --> 00:36:13,839
than letters smaller than words yes yes
 

1993
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:15,670
than letters smaller than words yes yes
and you could think of very very common

1994
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:15,680
and you could think of very very common
 

1995
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,510
and you could think of very very common
words like v i mean that would be a

1996
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:17,520
words like v i mean that would be a
 

1997
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,990
words like v i mean that would be a
single token but very quickly you you're

1998
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:20,000
single token but very quickly you you're
 

1999
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,310
single token but very quickly you you're
talking two three four four tokens have

2000
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:22,320
talking two three four four tokens have
 

2001
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,349
talking two three four four tokens have
you ever tried to tokenize emojis emojis

2002
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:25,359
you ever tried to tokenize emojis emojis
 

2003
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:27,190
you ever tried to tokenize emojis emojis
are actually just

2004
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:27,200
are actually just
 

2005
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:27,990
are actually just
um

2006
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:28,000
um
 

2007
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,030
um
sequences of letters so maybe to you but

2008
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:31,040
sequences of letters so maybe to you but
 

2009
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,270
sequences of letters so maybe to you but
to me they mean so much more yeah you

2010
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:33,280
to me they mean so much more yeah you
 

2011
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,349
to me they mean so much more yeah you
can render the emoji but you you might

2012
00:36:35,349 --> 00:36:35,359
can render the emoji but you you might
 

2013
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,430
can render the emoji but you you might
if you actually just yeah this is a

2014
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:37,440
if you actually just yeah this is a
 

2015
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,470
if you actually just yeah this is a
philosophical question is emojis an

2016
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:40,480
philosophical question is emojis an
 

2017
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,270
philosophical question is emojis an
image or a text

2018
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:43,280
image or a text
 

2019
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,470
image or a text
the way

2020
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:44,480
the way
 

2021
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,910
the way
we do these things these things is

2022
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:45,920
we do these things these things is
 

2023
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,829
we do these things these things is
they're actually mapped to seek small

2024
00:36:47,829 --> 00:36:47,839
they're actually mapped to seek small
 

2025
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:50,390
they're actually mapped to seek small
sequences of characters yeah so

2026
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:50,400
sequences of characters yeah so
 

2027
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,550
sequences of characters yeah so
you can actually play with these models

2028
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:52,560
you can actually play with these models
 

2029
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,710
you can actually play with these models
and input emojis it will output emojis

2030
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:54,720
and input emojis it will output emojis
 

2031
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,109
and input emojis it will output emojis
back um which is actually quite a fun

2032
00:36:57,109 --> 00:36:57,119
back um which is actually quite a fun
 

2033
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:59,030
back um which is actually quite a fun
exercise you probably can find other

2034
00:36:59,030 --> 00:36:59,040
exercise you probably can find other
 

2035
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,310
exercise you probably can find other
tweets about this um out there um but

2036
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:02,320
tweets about this um out there um but
 

2037
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,550
tweets about this um out there um but
yeah so anyways tex there's like it's

2038
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:04,560
yeah so anyways tex there's like it's
 

2039
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,270
yeah so anyways tex there's like it's
very clear how this is done and then in

2040
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:07,280
very clear how this is done and then in
 

2041
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,550
very clear how this is done and then in
gato

2042
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:08,560
gato
 

2043
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,390
gato
what we did for images is we map images

2044
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:12,400
what we did for images is we map images
 

2045
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,870
what we did for images is we map images
to essentially we compressed images so

2046
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:14,880
to essentially we compressed images so
 

2047
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,950
to essentially we compressed images so
to speak into something that looks more

2048
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:16,960
to speak into something that looks more
 

2049
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,710
to speak into something that looks more
like um

2050
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:18,720
like um
 

2051
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,630
like um
less like every pixel with every

2052
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:20,640
less like every pixel with every
 

2053
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,790
less like every pixel with every
intensity that would mean we have a very

2054
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:22,800
intensity that would mean we have a very
 

2055
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,550
intensity that would mean we have a very
long sequence right like if we were

2056
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:24,560
long sequence right like if we were
 

2057
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,190
long sequence right like if we were
talking about 100 by 100 pixel images

2058
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:27,200
talking about 100 by 100 pixel images
 

2059
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,109
talking about 100 by 100 pixel images
that would make the sequences far too

2060
00:37:29,109 --> 00:37:29,119
that would make the sequences far too
 

2061
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:32,390
that would make the sequences far too
long so what was done there is you just

2062
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:32,400
long so what was done there is you just
 

2063
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,150
long so what was done there is you just
use a technique that essentially

2064
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:34,160
use a technique that essentially
 

2065
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:38,550
use a technique that essentially
compresses an image into maybe 16 by 16

2066
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:38,560
compresses an image into maybe 16 by 16
 

2067
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,670
compresses an image into maybe 16 by 16
patches of pixels and then that is map

2068
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:41,680
patches of pixels and then that is map
 

2069
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,910
patches of pixels and then that is map
again tokenize you just essentially

2070
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:43,920
again tokenize you just essentially
 

2071
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,950
again tokenize you just essentially
quantize this space into

2072
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:46,960
quantize this space into
 

2073
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,950
quantize this space into
a special word that actually maps to

2074
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:48,960
a special word that actually maps to
 

2075
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,990
a special word that actually maps to
these little sequence of pixels and then

2076
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:52,000
these little sequence of pixels and then
 

2077
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,150
these little sequence of pixels and then
you put the pixels together in some

2078
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:54,160
you put the pixels together in some
 

2079
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,710
you put the pixels together in some
raster order and then that's how you get

2080
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:56,720
raster order and then that's how you get
 

2081
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,750
raster order and then that's how you get
out um or in or in the image that your

2082
00:37:59,750 --> 00:37:59,760
out um or in or in the image that your
 

2083
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,270
out um or in or in the image that your
your your process but there's no

2084
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:01,280
your your process but there's no
 

2085
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,710
your your process but there's no
semantic

2086
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:02,720
semantic
 

2087
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,270
semantic
aspect to that so you're doing some kind

2088
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:05,280
aspect to that so you're doing some kind
 

2089
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,950
aspect to that so you're doing some kind
of you don't need to understand anything

2090
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:06,960
of you don't need to understand anything
 

2091
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,790
of you don't need to understand anything
about the image in order to tokenize it

2092
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:08,800
about the image in order to tokenize it
 

2093
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,349
about the image in order to tokenize it
currently no you you're only using this

2094
00:38:11,349 --> 00:38:11,359
currently no you you're only using this
 

2095
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:13,109
currently no you you're only using this
notion of compression so you're trying

2096
00:38:13,109 --> 00:38:13,119
notion of compression so you're trying
 

2097
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:13,910
notion of compression so you're trying
to

2098
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:13,920
to
 

2099
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,870
to
find common it's like jpg or all these

2100
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:16,880
find common it's like jpg or all these
 

2101
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,190
find common it's like jpg or all these
algorithms it's actually very similar at

2102
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:19,200
algorithms it's actually very similar at
 

2103
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,030
algorithms it's actually very similar at
the tokenization level all we're doing

2104
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:21,040
the tokenization level all we're doing
 

2105
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,589
the tokenization level all we're doing
is finding common patterns and then

2106
00:38:23,589 --> 00:38:23,599
is finding common patterns and then
 

2107
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:24,790
is finding common patterns and then
making sure

2108
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:24,800
making sure
 

2109
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,030
making sure
in a lossy way we compress these images

2110
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:27,040
in a lossy way we compress these images
 

2111
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,510
in a lossy way we compress these images
given the statistics of the images that

2112
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:29,520
given the statistics of the images that
 

2113
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,349
given the statistics of the images that
are contained in all the data we deal

that jpeg
 

2119
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,710
that jpeg
does have some understanding of images

does have some understanding of images
 

2121
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,710

compressing based crudely based on color
 

2129
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,870
compressing based crudely based on color
does capture some

00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:48,880
does capture some
 

2131
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,030
does capture some
something important about an image

00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:51,040
something important about an image
 

2133
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,030
something important about an image
that's about its meaning not just about

00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:53,040
that's about its meaning not just about
 

2135
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,470
that's about its meaning not just about
some statistics

2136
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:54,480
some statistics
 

2137
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,630
some statistics
yeah i mean jp as i said is very the

2138
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:56,640
yeah i mean jp as i said is very the
 

2139

yeah i mean jp as i said is very the
algorithms look actually very similar to

algorithms look actually very similar to
 

2141
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,790
algorithms look actually very similar to
they use this the the

00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:00,800
they use this the the
 

2143
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,950
they use this the the

um the the approach we usually do in

2146
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:06,240
um the the approach we usually do in
 

2147
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,670
um the the approach we usually do in
machine learning when we deal with

2148
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:07,680
machine learning when we deal with
 

2149
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,990
machine learning when we deal with
images and we do this quantization step

2150
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:10,000
images and we do this quantization step
 

2151
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,310
images and we do this quantization step
is a bit more data driven so rather than

2152
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:12,320
is a bit more data driven so rather than
 

2153
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,790
is a bit more data driven so rather than
have some sort of fourier basis for how

2154
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:14,800
have some sort of fourier basis for how
 

2155
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,870
have some sort of fourier basis for how
you know frequencies appear in natural

2156
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:16,880
you know frequencies appear in natural
 

2157
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,790
you know frequencies appear in natural
in the natural world

2158
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:18,800
in the natural world
 

2159
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,910
in the natural world
we actually just use

2160
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:21,920
we actually just use
 

2161
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,150
we actually just use
the statistics of the images and then

2162
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:24,160
the statistics of the images and then
 

2163
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,870
the statistics of the images and then
quantize them based on the statistics

2164
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:26,880
quantize them based on the statistics
 

2165
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,390
quantize them based on the statistics
much like you do in words right so

2166
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:28,400
much like you do in words right so
 

2167
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,150
much like you do in words right so
common subscript sub strings are

2168
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:30,160
common subscript sub strings are
 

2169
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,510
common subscript sub strings are
allocated a token um and images is very

2170
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:33,520
allocated a token um and images is very
 

2171
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,670
allocated a token um and images is very
similar but there's no

2172
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:35,680
similar but there's no
 

2173
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,109
similar but there's no
connection

2174
00:39:37,109 --> 00:39:37,119

the token space if you think of oh like

2176
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:39,520
the token space if you think of oh like
 

2177
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,589
the token space if you think of oh like
the tokens are an integer and in the end

2178
00:39:41,589 --> 00:39:41,599
the tokens are an integer and in the end
 

2179
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:44,710
the tokens are an integer and in the end
of the day so now like we work on

2180
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:44,720
of the day so now like we work on
 

2181
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,950
of the day so now like we work on
maybe we have about let's say i don't

2182
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:46,960
maybe we have about let's say i don't
 

2183
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,710
maybe we have about let's say i don't
know the exact numbers but let's say 10

2184
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:48,720
know the exact numbers but let's say 10
 

2185
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,670
know the exact numbers but let's say 10
000 tokens for text right certainly more

2186
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:51,680
000 tokens for text right certainly more
 

2187
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,670
000 tokens for text right certainly more
than characters because we have groups

2188
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:53,680
than characters because we have groups
 

2189
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,069
than characters because we have groups
of characters and so on so from one to

2190
00:39:56,069 --> 00:39:56,079
of characters and so on so from one to
 

2191
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:58,470
of characters and so on so from one to
ten thousand those are representing all

2192
00:39:58,470 --> 00:39:58,480
ten thousand those are representing all
 

2193
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,950
ten thousand those are representing all
the language and the words we'll see and

2194
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:00,960
the language and the words we'll see and
 

2195
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,510
the language and the words we'll see and
then images occupy the next set of

2196
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:03,520
then images occupy the next set of
 

2197
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,950
then images occupy the next set of
integers so they're completely

2198
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:04,960
integers so they're completely
 

2199
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,190
integers so they're completely
independent right so from ten thousand

2200
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:07,200
independent right so from ten thousand
 

2201
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,270
independent right so from ten thousand
one to twenty thousand those are the

2202
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:09,280
one to twenty thousand those are the
 

2203
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,950
one to twenty thousand those are the
tokens that represent these other

2204
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:10,960
tokens that represent these other

and
 

2209
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,309
and
that is an interesting

2210
00:40:16,309 --> 00:40:16,319
that is an interesting
 

2211
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:19,109
that is an interesting

the pixels and that will start making
 

2229
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,790
the pixels and that will start making
the connections between the tokens so

00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,030
this sequence of integers but they
occupy different space and what connects

2266
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:23,040
occupy different space and what connects
 

2267
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,710
occupy different space and what connects
them is then the learning algorithm

2268
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:24,720
them is then the learning algorithm
 

2269
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,390
them is then the learning algorithm
that's where the magic happens so the

2270
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:26,400
that's where the magic happens so the
 

2271
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,910
that's where the magic happens so the
modalities are

2272
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:27,920
modalities are
 

2273
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,230
modalities are
orthogonal to each other in token space

2274
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:30,240
orthogonal to each other in token space
 

2275
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,309
orthogonal to each other in token space
right so in the input

2276
00:41:32,309 --> 00:41:32,319
right so in the input
 

2277
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:35,190
right so in the input
everything you add you add extra tokens

2278
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:35,200
everything you add you add extra tokens
 

2279
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,030
everything you add you add extra tokens
right and then

2280
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:37,040
right and then
 

2281
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,750
right and then
you're shoving all of that into one

2282
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:39,760
you're shoving all of that into one
 

2283
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,910
you're shoving all of that into one
place yes the transformer and that

2284
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:41,920
place yes the transformer and that
 

2285
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,109
place yes the transformer and that
transformer that transformer

2286
00:41:45,109 --> 00:41:45,119
transformer that transformer
 

2287
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:46,150
transformer that transformer
tries

00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:46,160
tries
 

2289
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,430
tries
to look at this gigantic token space and

00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,630
like what
if you were to ask questions is it

00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:34,640
if you were to ask questions is it
 

2335
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,030
if you were to ask questions is it
schizophrenic or is it uh does it is it

of one mind
 

2339
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,670
of one mind
i mean it is it is one mind um and it's

2340
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:41,680
i mean it is it is one mind um and it's
 

2341
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,309
i mean it is it is one mind um and it's
actually the very the simplest algorithm

00:42:44,309 --> 00:42:44,319
actually the very the simplest algorithm
 

2343
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:47,109
actually the very the simplest algorithm
which um that's kind of in a way how it

2344
00:42:47,109 --> 00:42:47,119
which um that's kind of in a way how it
 

2345
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:48,870
which um that's kind of in a way how it
feels like the field

2346
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:48,880
feels like the field
 

2347
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,589
feels like the field
hasn't changed since back propagation

00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:54,069
hasn't changed since back propagation
and gradient descent was purpose for

00:42:54,069 --> 00:42:54,079
and gradient descent was purpose for
 

2351
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:56,390
and gradient descent was purpose for
learning neural networks so

2352
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:56,400
learning neural networks so
 

2353
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,910
learning neural networks so
there is obviously details on the

00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,670
there is obviously details on the

2356
00:42:59,670 --> 00:42:59,680
architecture this has evolved the
 

2357
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,510

current iteration

2358
00:43:01,510 --> 00:43:01,520
current iteration
 

2359
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,910
current iteration
is still the transformer which is

2360
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:03,920
is still the transformer which is
 

2361
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,349
is still the transformer which is
a powerful

2362
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:05,359
a powerful
 

2363
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:08,950
a powerful
sequence modeling architecture but then

2364
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:08,960
sequence modeling architecture but then
 

2365
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,630
sequence modeling architecture but then
the goal of this

2366
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:10,640
the goal of this
 

2367
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,870
the goal of this
you know setting these weights to

2368
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:12,880
you know setting these weights to
 

2369
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,349
you know setting these weights to
predict the data is essentially the same

2370
00:43:15,349 --> 00:43:15,359
predict the data is essentially the same
 

2371
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:17,430
predict the data is essentially the same
as basically i could describe i mean we

2372
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:17,440
as basically i could describe i mean we
 

2373
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,589
as basically i could describe i mean we
described a few years ago alpha star

2374
00:43:19,589 --> 00:43:19,599

language modeling and so on right we we

2376
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:22,400
language modeling and so on right we we
 

2377
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,870
language modeling and so on right we we
take let's say an atari game um we map

2378
00:43:24,870 --> 00:43:24,880
take let's say an atari game um we map
 

2379
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:28,230
take let's say an atari game um we map
it to a string of numbers that will all

2380
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:28,240
it to a string of numbers that will all
 

2381
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:31,270
it to a string of numbers that will all
be probably image space and action space

2382
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:31,280
be probably image space and action space
 

2383
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,670
be probably image space and action space
interleaved and all we're gonna do is

2384
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:33,680
interleaved and all we're gonna do is
 

2385
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,030
interleaved and all we're gonna do is
say okay

2386
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:35,040
say okay
 

2387
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,990
say okay

00:43:47,349 --> 00:43:47,359
and you're just
 

2399
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:49,750

00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:49,760
optimizing these weights be a very
 

2401
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,870
optimizing these weights be a very
simple

2402
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:50,880
simple
 

2403
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,109

gradient like you know mathematical is

2404
00:43:53,109 --> 00:43:53,119
gradient like you know mathematical is
 

2405
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:54,630

almost the most boring algorithm you

2406
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:54,640
almost the most boring algorithm you
 

2407
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:57,109
almost the most boring algorithm you
could imagine we settle the weights so

2408
00:43:57,109 --> 00:43:57,119
could imagine we settle the weights so
 

2409
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:00,069
could imagine we settle the weights so
that given this particular instance

2410
00:44:00,069 --> 00:44:00,079
that given this particular instance
 

2411
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:03,190
that given this particular instance
these weights are set to maximize the

2412
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:03,200
these weights are set to maximize the
 

2413
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,190
these weights are set to maximize the
probability of having seen this

2414
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:05,200
probability of having seen this
 

2415
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,510
probability of having seen this
particular sequence of integers for this

2416
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:07,520
particular sequence of integers for this
 

2417
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:08,950
particular sequence of integers for this
particular game

2418
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:08,960
particular game
 

2419
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:09,990
particular game
and then

2420
00:44:09,990 --> 00:44:10,000
and then
 

2421
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,790
and then
the algorithm does this for many many

2422
00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:12,800
the algorithm does this for many many
 

2423
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:16,069
the algorithm does this for many many
many iterations um looking at different

2424
00:44:16,069 --> 00:44:16,079
many iterations um looking at different
 

2425
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:17,990
many iterations um looking at different
modalities different games right that's

2426
00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:18,000
modalities different games right that's
 

2427
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,390
modalities different games right that's
the mixture of the data set we discuss

2428
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:20,400
the mixture of the data set we discuss
 

2429
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,910
the mixture of the data set we discuss
so in a way it's a very simple algorithm

2430
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:23,920
so in a way it's a very simple algorithm
 

2431
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:24,710
so in a way it's a very simple algorithm
and

2432
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:24,720
and
 

2433
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:27,190
and
the weights right they're all shared

2434
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:27,200
the weights right they're all shared
 

2435
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,510
the weights right they're all shared
right so in terms of is it focusing on

00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:29,520
right so in terms of is it focusing on
 

2437
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,670
right so in terms of is it focusing on
one modality or not the intermediate

actions in certain space
 

2537
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:22,870
actions in certain space
i'm defining actions by words right so

2538
00:46:22,870 --> 00:46:22,880
i'm defining actions by words right so
 

2539
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,109
i'm defining actions by words right so
you could imagine a world in which i'm

2540
00:46:25,109 --> 00:46:25,119
you could imagine a world in which i'm

that the action app in atari is its own

2544
00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:29,839
that the action app in atari is its own
 

2545
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:31,030
that the action app in atari is its own
number

2546
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:31,040
number
 

2547
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,870
number
the action app in atari maybe is

2548
00:46:32,870 --> 00:46:32,880
the action app in atari maybe is
 

2549
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,750
the action app in atari maybe is
literally the word or the sentence app

2550
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:35,760
literally the word or the sentence app
 

2551
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,550
literally the word or the sentence app
in atari right and that would mean we

2552
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:38,560
in atari right and that would mean we
 

2553
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,870
in atari right and that would mean we
now leverage much more from the language

2554
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:40,880
now leverage much more from the language
 

2555
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,630
now leverage much more from the language
this is not what we did here but

2556
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:42,640
this is not what we did here but
 

2557
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,630
this is not what we did here but
certainly it might make these

2558
00:46:44,630 --> 00:46:44,640
certainly it might make these
 

2559
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:47,430
certainly it might make these
connections much easier to learn and

2560
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:47,440
connections much easier to learn and
 

2561
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,750
connections much easier to learn and
also to teach the model to correct its

2562
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:49,760
also to teach the model to correct its
 

2563
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:52,550
also to teach the model to correct its
own actions and so on right so all these

2564
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:52,560
own actions and so on right so all these
 

2565
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,950
own actions and so on right so all these

00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,470
one of the paths that you might take
next is

2592
00:47:22,470 --> 00:47:22,480

 

2593
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,270

doing the tokenization fundamentally as

2594
00:47:25,270 --> 00:47:25,280
doing the tokenization fundamentally as
 

2595
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,710
doing the tokenization fundamentally as
a kind of uh

2596
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:26,720
a kind of uh
 

2597
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,790
a kind of uh
linguistic communication so like you

2598
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:28,800
linguistic communication so like you
 

2599
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,349
linguistic communication so like you
convert even images into language so

2600
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:31,359
convert even images into language so
 

2601
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:33,510
convert even images into language so
doing something like a crude

2602
00:47:33,510 --> 00:47:33,520
doing something like a crude
 

2603
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,430
doing something like a crude
semantic segmentation

2604
00:47:35,430 --> 00:47:35,440
semantic segmentation
 

2605
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,270
semantic segmentation
trying to just assign a bunch of words

2606
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:37,280
trying to just assign a bunch of words
 

2607
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,030
trying to just assign a bunch of words
to an image that

2608
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:39,040
to an image that
 

2609
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,309
to an image that
like have

2610
00:47:40,309 --> 00:47:40,319
like have
 

2611
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:42,790
like have
almost like a dumb entity explaining as

2612
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:42,800
almost like a dumb entity explaining as
 

2613
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:45,349
almost like a dumb entity explaining as
much as you can about the the image and

2614
00:47:45,349 --> 00:47:45,359
much as you can about the the image and
 

2615
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:47,030
much as you can about the the image and
so you convert that into words and then

2616
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:47,040
so you convert that into words and then
 

2617
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,910
so you convert that into words and then
you convert games into words and and you

2618
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:49,920
you convert games into words and and you
 

2619
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,670
you convert games into words and and you
provide the context and words and all of

2620
00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:51,680
provide the context and words and all of
 

2621
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,430
provide the context and words and all of
it

2622
00:47:53,430 --> 00:47:53,440
it
 

2623
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,349
it
and eventually

2624
00:47:55,349 --> 00:47:55,359
and eventually
 

2625
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:56,710
and eventually
getting to a point where everybody

2626
00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:56,720
getting to a point where everybody
 

2627
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,710
getting to a point where everybody
agrees with noam chomsky that language

2628
00:47:58,710 --> 00:47:58,720
agrees with noam chomsky that language
 

2629
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,790
agrees with noam chomsky that language
is actually at the core of everything

2630
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:00,800
is actually at the core of everything
 

2631
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,349
is actually at the core of everything
that's it's the base layer of

2632
00:48:03,349 --> 00:48:03,359
that's it's the base layer of
 

2633
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:05,030
that's it's the base layer of
intelligence and consciousness and all

2634
00:48:05,030 --> 00:48:05,040
intelligence and consciousness and all
 

2635
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,109
intelligence and consciousness and all
that kind of stuff okay

2636
00:48:07,109 --> 00:48:07,119
that kind of stuff okay
 

2637
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:09,990
that kind of stuff okay
uh you mentioned early on like psy it's

2638
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:10,000
uh you mentioned early on like psy it's
 

2639
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,630
uh you mentioned early on like psy it's
hard to grow what did you mean by that

2640
00:48:12,630 --> 00:48:12,640
hard to grow what did you mean by that
 

2641
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,710
hard to grow what did you mean by that
because we're talking about scale might

2642
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:14,720
because we're talking about scale might
 

2643
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,230
because we're talking about scale might
change

2644
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:16,240
change
 

2645
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,230
change
uh there might be and we'll talk about

2646
00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:18,240
uh there might be and we'll talk about
 

2647
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,710
uh there might be and we'll talk about
this too like there's a

2648
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:20,720
this too like there's a
 

2649
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,790
this too like there's a
emergent

2650
00:48:22,790 --> 00:48:22,800
emergent
 

2651
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,230
emergent
there's certain things about these

2652
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:24,240
there's certain things about these
 

2653
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,670
there's certain things about these
neural networks that are emerging so

2654
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:25,680
neural networks that are emerging so
 

2655
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:27,910
neural networks that are emerging so
certain like performance we can see only

2656
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:27,920
certain like performance we can see only
 

2657
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,750
certain like performance we can see only
with scale and there's some kind of

2658
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:29,760
with scale and there's some kind of
 

2659
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,910
with scale and there's some kind of
threshold of scale so it

2660
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:31,920
threshold of scale so it
 

2661
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:34,549
threshold of scale so it
why is it hard to grow something like

2662
00:48:34,549 --> 00:48:34,559
why is it hard to grow something like
 

2663
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:36,549
why is it hard to grow something like
this meow network

2664
00:48:36,549 --> 00:48:36,559
this meow network
 

2665
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:37,270
this meow network
so

2666
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:37,280
so
 

2667
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:38,790
so
the meow network

2668
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:38,800
the meow network
 

2669
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,349
the meow network
is is not it's not hard to grow if you

2670
00:48:41,349 --> 00:48:41,359
is is not it's not hard to grow if you
 

2671
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:43,990
is is not it's not hard to grow if you
retrain it yeah what's hard is well we

2672
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:44,000
retrain it yeah what's hard is well we
 

2673
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,870
retrain it yeah what's hard is well we
have now one billion parameters um we

2674
00:48:46,870 --> 00:48:46,880
have now one billion parameters um we
 

2675
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,349
have now one billion parameters um we
train them for a while we we spend some

2676
00:48:49,349 --> 00:48:49,359
train them for a while we we spend some
 

2677
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:52,230
train them for a while we we spend some
amount of work towards building these

2678
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:52,240
amount of work towards building these
 

2679
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,870
amount of work towards building these
these weights that are an amazing

2680
00:48:54,870 --> 00:48:54,880
these weights that are an amazing
 

2681
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,870
these weights that are an amazing
initial brain for doing this kind of

2682
00:48:56,870 --> 00:48:56,880
initial brain for doing this kind of
 

2683
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,710
initial brain for doing this kind of
tasks we care about

2684
00:48:58,710 --> 00:48:58,720
tasks we care about
 

2685
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:01,030
tasks we care about
could we reuse the weights

2686
00:49:01,030 --> 00:49:01,040
could we reuse the weights
 

2687
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:05,349
could we reuse the weights
and expand to a larger brain and that is

2688
00:49:05,349 --> 00:49:05,359
and expand to a larger brain and that is
 

2689
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:08,150
and expand to a larger brain and that is
extraordinarily hard but also

2690
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:08,160
extraordinarily hard but also
 

2691
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,150
extraordinarily hard but also
exciting from a research perspective and

2692
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:10,160
exciting from a research perspective and
 

2693
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:11,910
exciting from a research perspective and
a practical perspective point of view

2694
00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:11,920
a practical perspective point of view
 

2695
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,349
a practical perspective point of view
right so

2696
00:49:13,349 --> 00:49:13,359
right so
 

2697
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:15,190
right so
there's this notion of

2698
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:15,200
there's this notion of
 

2699
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:18,549
there's this notion of
modularity in software engineering and

2700
00:49:18,549 --> 00:49:18,559
modularity in software engineering and
 

2701
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:20,549
modularity in software engineering and
we're starting to see some examples and

2702
00:49:20,549 --> 00:49:20,559
we're starting to see some examples and
 

2703
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:23,910
we're starting to see some examples and
work that leverages modularity in fact

2704
00:49:23,910 --> 00:49:23,920
work that leverages modularity in fact
 

2705
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:26,630
work that leverages modularity in fact
if we go back one step from gato to a

2706
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:26,640
if we go back one step from gato to a
 

2707
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:29,589
if we go back one step from gato to a
work that i would say train much larger

2708
00:49:29,589 --> 00:49:29,599
work that i would say train much larger
 

2709
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,349
work that i would say train much larger
much more capable network called

2710
00:49:31,349 --> 00:49:31,359
much more capable network called
 

2711
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:33,829
much more capable network called
flamingo flamingo did not deal with

2712
00:49:33,829 --> 00:49:33,839
flamingo flamingo did not deal with
 

2713
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:35,430
flamingo flamingo did not deal with
actions but it definitely dealt with

2714
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:35,440
actions but it definitely dealt with
 

2715
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:38,309
actions but it definitely dealt with
images in in a in an interesting way

2716
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:38,319
images in in a in an interesting way
 

2717
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:40,549
images in in a in an interesting way
kind of akin to what agato did but

2718
00:49:40,549 --> 00:49:40,559
kind of akin to what agato did but
 

2719
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:41,750
kind of akin to what agato did but
slightly different technique for

2720
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:41,760
slightly different technique for
 

2721
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:44,390
slightly different technique for
tokenizing but we don't need to go into

2722
00:49:44,390 --> 00:49:44,400
tokenizing but we don't need to go into
 

2723
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,470
tokenizing but we don't need to go into
that detail but

2724
00:49:46,470 --> 00:49:46,480
that detail but
 

2725
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:49,030
that detail but
what flamingo also did which gato didn't

2726
00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:49,040
what flamingo also did which gato didn't
 

2727
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,109
what flamingo also did which gato didn't
do and that just happens because these

2728
00:49:51,109 --> 00:49:51,119
do and that just happens because these
 

2729
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:52,549
do and that just happens because these
projects you know they're they're

2730
00:49:52,549 --> 00:49:52,559
projects you know they're they're
 

2731
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:54,309
projects you know they're they're
they're different you know it's a bit of

2732
00:49:54,309 --> 00:49:54,319
they're different you know it's a bit of
 

2733
00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:56,309
they're different you know it's a bit of
like the exploratory nature of research

2734
00:49:56,309 --> 00:49:56,319
like the exploratory nature of research
 

2735
00:49:56,319 --> 00:49:58,630
like the exploratory nature of research
which is great the research behind these

2736
00:49:58,630 --> 00:49:58,640
which is great the research behind these
 

2737
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:01,670
which is great the research behind these
projects is also modular yes exactly um

2738
00:50:01,670 --> 00:50:01,680
projects is also modular yes exactly um
 

2739
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,349
projects is also modular yes exactly um
and it has to be right we need we need

2740
00:50:03,349 --> 00:50:03,359
and it has to be right we need we need
 

2741
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:06,710
and it has to be right we need we need
to have creativity um and sometimes you

2742
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:06,720
to have creativity um and sometimes you
 

2743
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,790
to have creativity um and sometimes you
need to protect pockets of you know

2744
00:50:08,790 --> 00:50:08,800
need to protect pockets of you know
 

2745
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,470
need to protect pockets of you know
people researchers and so on but we

2746
00:50:10,470 --> 00:50:10,480
people researchers and so on but we
 

2747
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:13,349
people researchers and so on but we
believe in humans yes okay and also in

2748
00:50:13,349 --> 00:50:13,359
believe in humans yes okay and also in
 

2749
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:15,589
believe in humans yes okay and also in
particular researchers and maybe even

2750
00:50:15,589 --> 00:50:15,599
particular researchers and maybe even
 

2751
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:17,990
particular researchers and maybe even
further you know deep mine or or other

2752
00:50:17,990 --> 00:50:18,000
further you know deep mine or or other
 

2753
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,750
further you know deep mine or or other
such labs and then they act the neural

2754
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:19,760
such labs and then they act the neural
 

2755
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:22,309
such labs and then they act the neural
networks themselves so it's modularity

2756
00:50:22,309 --> 00:50:22,319
networks themselves so it's modularity
 

2757
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:24,150
networks themselves so it's modularity
all the way down okay all the way down

2758
00:50:24,150 --> 00:50:24,160
all the way down okay all the way down
 

2759
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,390
all the way down okay all the way down
so the way that we did modularity very

2760
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:26,400
so the way that we did modularity very
 

2761
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:29,190
so the way that we did modularity very
beautifully in flamingo is we took

2762
00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:29,200
beautifully in flamingo is we took
 

2763
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:32,150
beautifully in flamingo is we took
chinchilla which is a language only

2764
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:32,160
chinchilla which is a language only
 

2765
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,230
chinchilla which is a language only
model not an agent if we think of

2766
00:50:34,230 --> 00:50:34,240
model not an agent if we think of
 

2767
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,950
model not an agent if we think of
actions being necessary for agency so we

2768
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:36,960
actions being necessary for agency so we
 

2769
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:39,510
actions being necessary for agency so we
took chinchilla we took the weights of

2770
00:50:39,510 --> 00:50:39,520
took chinchilla we took the weights of
 

2771
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:40,870
took chinchilla we took the weights of
chinchilla

2772
00:50:40,870 --> 00:50:40,880
chinchilla
 

2773
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:43,910
chinchilla
and then we froze them we said these

2774
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:43,920
and then we froze them we said these
 

2775
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,750
and then we froze them we said these
don't change we train them to be very

2776
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:45,760
don't change we train them to be very
 

2777
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,670
don't change we train them to be very
good at predicting the next word is a

2778
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:47,680
good at predicting the next word is a
 

2779
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:49,910
good at predicting the next word is a
very good language model state of the

2780
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:49,920
very good language model state of the
 

2781
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:53,109
very good language model state of the
art at the time you release it etc etc

2782
00:50:53,109 --> 00:50:53,119
art at the time you release it etc etc
 

2783
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:55,510
art at the time you release it etc etc
going to add a capability to c right we

2784
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:55,520
going to add a capability to c right we
 

2785
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,030
going to add a capability to c right we
are going to add the ability to see to

2786
00:50:57,030 --> 00:50:57,040
are going to add the ability to see to
 

2787
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,870
are going to add the ability to see to
this language model so we're going to

2788
00:50:58,870 --> 00:50:58,880
this language model so we're going to
 

2789
00:50:58,880 --> 00:50:59,829
this language model so we're going to
attach

2790
00:50:59,829 --> 00:50:59,839
attach
 

2791
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:01,990
attach
um small pieces of neural networks at

2792
00:51:01,990 --> 00:51:02,000
um small pieces of neural networks at
 

2793
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,990
um small pieces of neural networks at
the right places in the model it's

2794
00:51:03,990 --> 00:51:04,000
the right places in the model it's
 

2795
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,190
the right places in the model it's
almost like

2796
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:05,200
almost like
 

2797
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,030
almost like
injecting

2798
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:07,040
injecting
 

2799
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:09,109
injecting
the network with some weights and some

2800
00:51:09,109 --> 00:51:09,119
the network with some weights and some
 

2801
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:10,710
the network with some weights and some
substructures

2802
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:10,720
substructures
 

2803
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,950
substructures
in the ways in a good way right so you

2804
00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:12,960
in the ways in a good way right so you
 

2805
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,710
in the ways in a good way right so you
need the research to say what is

2806
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:14,720
need the research to say what is
 

2807
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:16,630
need the research to say what is
effective how do you add this capability

2808
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:16,640
effective how do you add this capability
 

2809
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:20,390
effective how do you add this capability
without destroying others etc so we

2810
00:51:20,390 --> 00:51:20,400
without destroying others etc so we
 

2811
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:23,430
without destroying others etc so we
created a small sub network

2812
00:51:23,430 --> 00:51:23,440
created a small sub network
 

2813
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,829
created a small sub network
initialized not from random but actually

2814
00:51:25,829 --> 00:51:25,839
initialized not from random but actually
 

2815
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:28,950
initialized not from random but actually
from um self-supervised learning that

2816
00:51:28,950 --> 00:51:28,960
from um self-supervised learning that
 

2817
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,430
from um self-supervised learning that
you know a model that understands vision

2818
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:31,440
you know a model that understands vision
 

2819
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,829
you know a model that understands vision
um in general and then

2820
00:51:33,829 --> 00:51:33,839
um in general and then
 

2821
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:36,309
um in general and then
we took data sets that connect the two

2822
00:51:36,309 --> 00:51:36,319
we took data sets that connect the two
 

2823
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:39,589
we took data sets that connect the two
modalities vision and language and then

2824
00:51:39,589 --> 00:51:39,599
modalities vision and language and then
 

2825
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:41,750
modalities vision and language and then
we froze the main part the largest

2826
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:41,760
we froze the main part the largest
 

2827
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,109
we froze the main part the largest
portion of the network which was

2828
00:51:43,109 --> 00:51:43,119
portion of the network which was
 

2829
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:45,910
portion of the network which was
chinchilla that is 70 billion parameters

2830
00:51:45,910 --> 00:51:45,920
chinchilla that is 70 billion parameters
 

2831
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:48,230
chinchilla that is 70 billion parameters
and then we added a few more parameters

2832
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:48,240
and then we added a few more parameters
 

2833
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,470
and then we added a few more parameters
on top train from scratch

2834
00:51:50,470 --> 00:51:50,480
on top train from scratch
 

2835
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:51,829
on top train from scratch
and then some others that were

2836
00:51:51,829 --> 00:51:51,839
and then some others that were
 

2837
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:54,230
and then some others that were
pre-trained from like from with the

2838
00:51:54,230 --> 00:51:54,240
pre-trained from like from with the
 

2839
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:56,630
pre-trained from like from with the
capacity to see like it was a it was not

2840
00:51:56,630 --> 00:51:56,640
capacity to see like it was a it was not
 

2841
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:58,230
capacity to see like it was a it was not
tokenization in the way i described

2842
00:51:58,230 --> 00:51:58,240
tokenization in the way i described
 

2843
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:01,349
tokenization in the way i described
forgato but it's a similar idea

2844
00:52:01,349 --> 00:52:01,359
forgato but it's a similar idea
 

2845
00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:03,829
forgato but it's a similar idea
and then we train the whole system parts

2846
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:03,839
and then we train the whole system parts
 

2847
00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:06,549
and then we train the whole system parts
of it were frozen parts of it were new

2848
00:52:06,549 --> 00:52:06,559
of it were frozen parts of it were new
 

2849
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:09,190
of it were frozen parts of it were new
and all of a sudden we developed

2850
00:52:09,190 --> 00:52:09,200
and all of a sudden we developed
 

2851
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,589
and all of a sudden we developed
flamingo which is an amazing model that

2852
00:52:11,589 --> 00:52:11,599
flamingo which is an amazing model that
 

2853
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:14,309
flamingo which is an amazing model that
is essentially i mean describing it is

2854
00:52:14,309 --> 00:52:14,319
is essentially i mean describing it is
 

2855
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:16,470
is essentially i mean describing it is
a chat bot where you can also upload

2856
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:16,480
a chat bot where you can also upload
 

2857
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:19,430
a chat bot where you can also upload
images and start conversing about images

2858
00:52:19,430 --> 00:52:19,440
images and start conversing about images
 

2859
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,430
images and start conversing about images
um but it's also kind of a dialogue

2860
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:21,440
um but it's also kind of a dialogue
 

2861
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:22,710
um but it's also kind of a dialogue
style um

2862
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:22,720
style um
 

2863
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:25,430
style um
uh chatbot so the input is images and

2864
00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:25,440
uh chatbot so the input is images and
 

2865
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,589
uh chatbot so the input is images and
text and the output is text exactly

2866
00:52:27,589 --> 00:52:27,599
text and the output is text exactly
 

2867
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:29,910
text and the output is text exactly
um and how many parameters you said 70

2868
00:52:29,910 --> 00:52:29,920
um and how many parameters you said 70
 

2869
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:31,990
um and how many parameters you said 70
billion 70 billion for chinchilla yeah

2870
00:52:31,990 --> 00:52:32,000
billion 70 billion for chinchilla yeah
 

2871
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,670
billion 70 billion for chinchilla yeah
chinchilla is 70 billion and then the

2872
00:52:33,670 --> 00:52:33,680
chinchilla is 70 billion and then the
 

2873
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,990
chinchilla is 70 billion and then the
ones we add on top which kind of almost

2874
00:52:35,990 --> 00:52:36,000
ones we add on top which kind of almost
 

2875
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,670
ones we add on top which kind of almost
is almost like um a way to overwrite its

2876
00:52:39,670 --> 00:52:39,680
is almost like um a way to overwrite its
 

2877
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,670
is almost like um a way to overwrite its
its little activations so that when it

2878
00:52:41,670 --> 00:52:41,680
its little activations so that when it
 

2879
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,910
its little activations so that when it
sees vision it does kind of a correct

2880
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:43,920
sees vision it does kind of a correct
 

2881
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:45,670
sees vision it does kind of a correct
computation of what it's seeing mapping

2882
00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:45,680
computation of what it's seeing mapping
 

2883
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:48,309
computation of what it's seeing mapping
it back towards so to speak um that adds

2884
00:52:48,309 --> 00:52:48,319
it back towards so to speak um that adds
 

2885
00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:50,950
it back towards so to speak um that adds
an extra 10 billion parameters right so

2886
00:52:50,950 --> 00:52:50,960
an extra 10 billion parameters right so
 

2887
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,109
an extra 10 billion parameters right so
it's total 80 billion the largest one we

2888
00:52:53,109 --> 00:52:53,119
it's total 80 billion the largest one we
 

2889
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:54,950
it's total 80 billion the largest one we
released and then

2890
00:52:54,950 --> 00:52:54,960
released and then
 

2891
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,390
released and then
you train it on

2892
00:52:56,390 --> 00:52:56,400
you train it on
 

2893
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,549
you train it on
a few data sets that contain vision and

2894
00:52:58,549 --> 00:52:58,559
a few data sets that contain vision and
 

2895
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:00,710
a few data sets that contain vision and
language and once you interact with the

2896
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:00,720
language and once you interact with the
 

2897
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:03,030
language and once you interact with the
model you start seeing that you can

2898
00:53:03,030 --> 00:53:03,040
model you start seeing that you can
 

2899
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:05,349
model you start seeing that you can
upload an image and start sort of having

2900
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:05,359
upload an image and start sort of having
 

2901
00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:08,470
upload an image and start sort of having
a dialogue about the image um which is

2902
00:53:08,470 --> 00:53:08,480
a dialogue about the image um which is
 

2903
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,309
a dialogue about the image um which is
actually not something it's it's very

2904
00:53:10,309 --> 00:53:10,319
actually not something it's it's very
 

2905
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:11,829
actually not something it's it's very
similar and akin to what we saw in

2906
00:53:11,829 --> 00:53:11,839
similar and akin to what we saw in
 

2907
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:14,150
similar and akin to what we saw in
language only this prompting abilities

2908
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:14,160

so what we try to do and it's very

2958
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:08,880
so what we try to do and it's very
 

2959
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,710
so what we try to do and it's very
anecdotally i mean this is not a proof

2960
00:54:10,710 --> 00:54:10,720
anecdotally i mean this is not a proof
 

2961
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,870
anecdotally i mean this is not a proof
that we solved this issue but

2962
00:54:12,870 --> 00:54:12,880
that we solved this issue but
 

2963
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:15,030
that we solved this issue but
it just shows that you can upload now

2964
00:54:15,030 --> 00:54:15,040
it just shows that you can upload now
 

2965
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:16,870
it just shows that you can upload now
this image and start conversing with the

2966
00:54:16,870 --> 00:54:16,880
this image and start conversing with the
 

2967
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:19,270
this image and start conversing with the
model trying to make out if it if it

2968
00:54:19,270 --> 00:54:19,280
model trying to make out if it if it
 

2969
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:21,829
model trying to make out if it if it
gets that there's a joke um because the

2970
00:54:21,829 --> 00:54:21,839
gets that there's a joke um because the
 

2971
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:23,510
gets that there's a joke um because the
person waiting themselves don't see that

2972
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:23,520
person waiting themselves don't see that
 

2973
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,670
person waiting themselves don't see that
doesn't see that someone behind is

2974
00:54:25,670 --> 00:54:25,680
doesn't see that someone behind is
 

2975
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,190
doesn't see that someone behind is
making the weight higher and so on and

2976
00:54:27,190 --> 00:54:27,200
making the weight higher and so on and
 

2977
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,030
making the weight higher and so on and
so forth so it's a fascinating

2978
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:29,040
so forth so it's a fascinating
 

2979
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,390
so forth so it's a fascinating
capability

2980
00:54:30,390 --> 00:54:30,400
capability
 

2981
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,390
capability
um and it comes from this key idea of

2982
00:54:32,390 --> 00:54:32,400
um and it comes from this key idea of
 

2983
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,790
um and it comes from this key idea of
modularity where we took a frozen brain

2984
00:54:34,790 --> 00:54:34,800
modularity where we took a frozen brain
 

2985
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:35,990
modularity where we took a frozen brain
and we just

2986
00:54:35,990 --> 00:54:36,000
and we just
 

2987
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,630
and we just
added a new capability so

2988
00:54:38,630 --> 00:54:38,640
added a new capability so
 

2989
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:40,069
added a new capability so
the question is

2990
00:54:40,069 --> 00:54:40,079
the question is
 

2991
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:42,150
the question is
should we so in a way you can see even

2992
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:42,160
should we so in a way you can see even
 

2993
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:44,150
should we so in a way you can see even
from deepmind we have flamingo that this

2994
00:54:44,150 --> 00:54:44,160
from deepmind we have flamingo that this
 

2995
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:47,109
from deepmind we have flamingo that this
this moderate approach um and thus could

2996
00:54:47,109 --> 00:54:47,119
this moderate approach um and thus could
 

2997
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:49,109
this moderate approach um and thus could
leverage the scale a bit more reasonably

2998
00:54:49,109 --> 00:54:49,119
leverage the scale a bit more reasonably
 

2999
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:50,549
leverage the scale a bit more reasonably
because we didn't need to retrain a

3000
00:54:50,549 --> 00:54:50,559
because we didn't need to retrain a
 

3001
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:53,030
because we didn't need to retrain a
system from scratch and the other on the

3002
00:54:53,030 --> 00:54:53,040
system from scratch and the other on the
 

3003
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,030
system from scratch and the other on the
other hand we had gato which used the

3004
00:54:55,030 --> 00:54:55,040
other hand we had gato which used the
 

3005
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:56,630
other hand we had gato which used the
same data sets but then it trained it

3006
00:54:56,630 --> 00:54:56,640
same data sets but then it trained it
 

3007
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:59,030
same data sets but then it trained it
from scratch right and so i guess

3008
00:54:59,030 --> 00:54:59,040
from scratch right and so i guess
 

3009
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:01,510
from scratch right and so i guess
big question for the community is

3010
00:55:01,510 --> 00:55:01,520
big question for the community is
 

3011
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:03,270
big question for the community is
should we train from scratch or should

3012
00:55:03,270 --> 00:55:03,280
should we train from scratch or should
 

3013
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:05,990
should we train from scratch or should
we embrace modularity and this lies like

3014
00:55:05,990 --> 00:55:06,000
we embrace modularity and this lies like
 

3015
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,510
we embrace modularity and this lies like
this goes back to

3016
00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:07,520
this goes back to
 

3017
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:11,030
this goes back to
modularity as a way to grow but reuse

3018
00:55:11,030 --> 00:55:11,040
modularity as a way to grow but reuse
 

3019
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,190
modularity as a way to grow but reuse
seems like natural and it was very

3020
00:55:13,190 --> 00:55:13,200
seems like natural and it was very
 

3021
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:16,230
seems like natural and it was very
effective certainly the next question is

3022
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:16,240
effective certainly the next question is
 

3023
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:18,950
effective certainly the next question is
if you go the way of modularity

3024
00:55:18,950 --> 00:55:18,960
if you go the way of modularity
 

3025
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,190
if you go the way of modularity
is there a systematic way

3026
00:55:21,190 --> 00:55:21,200
is there a systematic way
 

3027
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,349
is there a systematic way
of freezing weights and joining

3028
00:55:23,349 --> 00:55:23,359
of freezing weights and joining
 

3029
00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:25,349
of freezing weights and joining

you know not just two or three or four
 

3035
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:31,030
you know not just two or three or four
networks but hundreds of networks from

00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:31,040
networks but hundreds of networks from
 

3037
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:32,870
networks but hundreds of networks from
all different kinds of places maybe open

3038
00:55:32,870 --> 00:55:32,880
all different kinds of places maybe open
 

3039
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:35,109
all different kinds of places maybe open
source network that looks at weather

3040

and you shove that in somehow and then

3044
00:55:38,069 --> 00:55:38,079
and you shove that in somehow and then
 

3045
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:40,309
and you shove that in somehow and then
you have networks that uh i don't know

3046
00:55:40,309 --> 00:55:40,319
you have networks that uh i don't know
 

3047
00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:42,069
you have networks that uh i don't know
do all kinds of to play starcraft and

3048
00:55:42,069 --> 00:55:42,079
do all kinds of to play starcraft and
 

3049
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:44,630
do all kinds of to play starcraft and
play all the other video games and they

3050
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:44,640
play all the other video games and they
 

3051
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:47,030
play all the other video games and they
you can keep adding them in

3052
00:55:47,030 --> 00:55:47,040
you can keep adding them in
 

3053
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:49,589
you can keep adding them in
without significant effort

3054
00:55:49,589 --> 00:55:49,599
without significant effort
 

3055
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:51,829
without significant effort
like that maybe the effort scales

3056
00:55:51,829 --> 00:55:51,839
like that maybe the effort scales
 

3057
00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:53,270
like that maybe the effort scales
linearly or something like that as

3058
00:55:53,270 --> 00:55:53,280
linearly or something like that as
 

3059
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:54,870
linearly or something like that as
opposed to like the more network you add

3060
00:55:54,870 --> 00:55:54,880
opposed to like the more network you add
 

3061
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:56,390
opposed to like the more network you add
the more you have to worry about the

3062
00:55:56,390 --> 00:55:56,400
the more you have to worry about the
 

3063
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,630
the more you have to worry about the
instabilities created yeah so that that

3064
00:55:58,630 --> 00:55:58,640
instabilities created yeah so that that
 

3065
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,829
instabilities created yeah so that that
vision is beautiful i think

00:56:00,839 --> 00:56:03,829
vision is beautiful i think
um there's still the question about

3068
00:56:03,829 --> 00:56:03,839
um there's still the question about
 

3069
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:06,069
um there's still the question about
within single modalities like chinchilla

3070
00:56:06,069 --> 00:56:06,079
within single modalities like chinchilla
 

3071
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:08,470
within single modalities like chinchilla
was reused but now if we train a next

3072
00:56:08,470 --> 00:56:08,480
was reused but now if we train a next
 

3073
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:10,390
was reused but now if we train a next
iteration of language models are we

3074
00:56:10,390 --> 00:56:10,400
iteration of language models are we
 

3075
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:11,990
iteration of language models are we
going to use chinchilla or not yeah how

3076
00:56:11,990 --> 00:56:12,000
going to use chinchilla or not yeah how
 

3077
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,390
going to use chinchilla or not yeah how
do you swap out chinch right so

3078
00:56:14,390 --> 00:56:14,400
do you swap out chinch right so
 

3079
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:15,990
do you swap out chinch right so
there's there's still big questions but

3080
00:56:15,990 --> 00:56:16,000
there's there's still big questions but
 

3081
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,470
there's there's still big questions but
that idea is is actually really akin to

3082
00:56:18,470 --> 00:56:18,480
that idea is is actually really akin to
 

3083
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,230
that idea is is actually really akin to
software engineering which we're not

3084
00:56:20,230 --> 00:56:20,240
software engineering which we're not
 

3085
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:21,990
software engineering which we're not
re-implementing you know libraries from

3086
00:56:21,990 --> 00:56:22,000
re-implementing you know libraries from
 

3087
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,150
re-implementing you know libraries from
scratch we're reusing and then building

3088
00:56:24,150 --> 00:56:24,160
scratch we're reusing and then building
 

3089
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:25,750
scratch we're reusing and then building
ever more amazing things including

3090
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:25,760
ever more amazing things including
 

3091
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:28,549
ever more amazing things including
neural networks with software that we're

3092
00:56:28,549 --> 00:56:28,559
neural networks with software that we're
 

3093
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:31,510
neural networks with software that we're
using so i think this idea of modularity

3094
00:56:31,510 --> 00:56:31,520
using so i think this idea of modularity
 

3095
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:34,390
using so i think this idea of modularity
i like it i think it's here to stay and

3096
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:34,400
i like it i think it's here to stay and
 

3097
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,309
i like it i think it's here to stay and
that's also why i mentioned it's just

3098
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:36,319
that's also why i mentioned it's just
 

3099
00:56:36,319 --> 00:56:38,230
that's also why i mentioned it's just
the beginning not the end

3100
00:56:38,230 --> 00:56:38,240
the beginning not the end
 

3101
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:40,150
the beginning not the end
you mentioned metal learning so given

this promise of gatto
 

3105
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:45,910
this promise of gatto
can we try to redefine this term

3106
00:56:45,910 --> 00:56:45,920
can we try to redefine this term
 

3107
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:47,670
can we try to redefine this term
that's almost akin to consciousness

3108
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:47,680
that's almost akin to consciousness
 

3109
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:49,510
that's almost akin to consciousness
because it means different things to

do you think great with all the wisdom

3128
00:57:09,109 --> 00:57:09,119
do you think great with all the wisdom
 

3129
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:11,270
do you think great with all the wisdom
we've learned so far yeah great great

meta learning

3144
00:57:24,390 --> 00:57:24,400
meta learning
 

3145
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:27,030
meta learning
meant something that has changed mostly

3146
00:57:27,030 --> 00:57:27,040
meant something that has changed mostly
 

3147
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:28,069
meant something that has changed mostly
through the

through the
 

3149
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:32,150
through the
revolution of gpt3 and beyond so what

3150
00:57:32,150 --> 00:57:32,160
revolution of gpt3 and beyond so what
 

3151
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:35,030
revolution of gpt3 and beyond so what
meta-learning meant at the time um

3152
00:57:35,030 --> 00:57:35,040
meta-learning meant at the time um
 

3153
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,190
meta-learning meant at the time um
was driven by what benchmarks people

3154
00:57:37,190 --> 00:57:37,200
was driven by what benchmarks people
 

3155
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,270
was driven by what benchmarks people
care about in metal learning and the

3156
00:57:39,270 --> 00:57:39,280
care about in metal learning and the
 

3157
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:41,750
care about in metal learning and the
benchmarks were about

3158
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:41,760
benchmarks were about
 

3159
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:44,230
benchmarks were about
a capability to learn about object

3160
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:44,240
a capability to learn about object
 

3161
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:47,030
a capability to learn about object
identities so it was very much over

3162
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:47,040
identities so it was very much over
 

3163
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:49,109

00:57:53,589 --> 00:57:53,599
about that was that oh we're not just
 

3169
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:55,589
about that was that oh we're not just
learning a thousand categories that

object categories that can be defined
 

3177
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:04,789
object categories that can be defined
when we interact with the model so

3178
00:58:04,789 --> 00:58:04,799
when we interact with the model so
 

3179
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:06,470
when we interact with the model so
it's interesting to see the evolution

3180
00:58:06,470 --> 00:58:06,480
it's interesting to see the evolution
 

3181
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:09,109
it's interesting to see the evolution
right the way the way this started was

3182
00:58:09,109 --> 00:58:09,119
right the way the way this started was
 

3183
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:11,750
right the way the way this started was
we have a special language that was a

3184
00:58:11,750 --> 00:58:11,760
we have a special language that was a
 

3185
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:13,990
we have a special language that was a
data set a small data set that we

3186
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:14,000
data set a small data set that we
 

3187
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,549
data set a small data set that we
prompted the model with saying hey here

3188
00:58:16,549 --> 00:58:16,559
prompted the model with saying hey here
 

3189
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:18,950

is a new classification task

3190
00:58:18,950 --> 00:58:18,960
is a new classification task
 

3191
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:21,750
is a new classification task
i'll give you one image and the name

3192
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:21,760
i'll give you one image and the name
 

3193
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,750
i'll give you one image and the name
which was an integer at the time of the

3194
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:23,760
which was an integer at the time of the
 

3195
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:26,150
which was an integer at the time of the
image and a different image and so on so

3196
00:58:26,150 --> 00:58:26,160
image and a different image and so on so
 

3197
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:29,430
image and a different image and so on so
you have a small prompt in the form of a

3198
00:58:29,430 --> 00:58:29,440
you have a small prompt in the form of a
 

3199
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:31,829
you have a small prompt in the form of a
data set a machine learning data set and

3200
00:58:31,829 --> 00:58:31,839
data set a machine learning data set and
 

3201
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:34,630
data set a machine learning data set and
then you got then a system that could

3202
00:58:34,630 --> 00:58:34,640
then you got then a system that could
 

3203
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:36,950
then you got then a system that could
then predict or classify these objects

3204
00:58:36,950 --> 00:58:36,960
then predict or classify these objects
 

3205
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:40,390
then predict or classify these objects
that you just defined kind of on the fly

3206
00:58:40,390 --> 00:58:40,400
that you just defined kind of on the fly
 

3207
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:41,589
that you just defined kind of on the fly
so

3208
00:58:41,589 --> 00:58:41,599
so
 

3209
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:43,109
so
fast forward

3210
00:58:43,109 --> 00:58:43,119
fast forward
 

3211
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:44,230
fast forward
it was

3212
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:44,240
it was
 

3213
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:45,750
it was
revealed that

3214
00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:45,760
revealed that
 

3215
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:47,430
revealed that
language models are future learners

3216
00:58:47,430 --> 00:58:47,440
language models are future learners
 

3217
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,510
language models are future learners
that's the title of the paper so very

3218
00:58:49,510 --> 00:58:49,520
that's the title of the paper so very
 

3219
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:51,270
that's the title of the paper so very
good title sometimes titles are really

3220
00:58:51,270 --> 00:58:51,280
good title sometimes titles are really
 

3221
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,589
good title sometimes titles are really
good so this one is really really good

3222
00:58:53,589 --> 00:58:53,599
good so this one is really really good
 

3223
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:56,150
good so this one is really really good
because that's that's the point of gpt3

3224
00:58:56,150 --> 00:58:56,160
because that's that's the point of gpt3
 

3225
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:58,549
because that's that's the point of gpt3
that showed that look

3226
00:58:58,549 --> 00:58:58,559

before imagenet and so on so there's a

3238
00:59:10,390 --> 00:59:10,400
before imagenet and so on so there's a
 

3239
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,870
before imagenet and so on so there's a
few benchmarks to now all of a sudden

3240
00:59:12,870 --> 00:59:12,880
few benchmarks to now all of a sudden
 

3241
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:15,430
few benchmarks to now all of a sudden
we're a bit unlocked from benchmarks and

3242
00:59:15,430 --> 00:59:15,440
we're a bit unlocked from benchmarks and
 

3243
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:17,589
we're a bit unlocked from benchmarks and
through language we can define tasks

3244
00:59:17,589 --> 00:59:17,599
through language we can define tasks
 

3245
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:19,750
through language we can define tasks
right so we're literally telling the

3246
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:19,760
right so we're literally telling the
 

3247
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:22,309
right so we're literally telling the
model some logical task or little thing

3248
00:59:22,309 --> 00:59:22,319
model some logical task or little thing
 

3249
00:59:22,319 --> 00:59:23,829
model some logical task or little thing
that we wanted to do

3250
00:59:23,829 --> 00:59:23,839
that we wanted to do
 

3251
00:59:23,839 --> 00:59:25,990
that we wanted to do
we prompted much like we did before but

3252
00:59:25,990 --> 00:59:26,000
we prompted much like we did before but
 

3253
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,510
we prompted much like we did before but
now we prompt it through natural

3254
00:59:27,510 --> 00:59:27,520
now we prompt it through natural
 

3255
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:29,510
now we prompt it through natural
language and then

3256
00:59:29,510 --> 00:59:29,520
language and then
 

3257
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:31,510
language and then
not perfectly i mean these models have

3258
00:59:31,510 --> 00:59:31,520
not perfectly i mean these models have
 

3259
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:34,069
not perfectly i mean these models have
failure modes and that's fine but

3260
00:59:34,069 --> 00:59:34,079
failure modes and that's fine but
 

3261
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:36,309
failure modes and that's fine but
no but these models then are now doing a

3262
00:59:36,309 --> 00:59:36,319
no but these models then are now doing a
 

3263
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:38,630
no but these models then are now doing a
new task right so they met to learn um

3264
00:59:38,630 --> 00:59:38,640
new task right so they met to learn um
 

3265
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:41,510
new task right so they met to learn um
these new capabilities now

3266
00:59:41,510 --> 00:59:41,520
these new capabilities now
 

3267
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:44,549
these new capabilities now
now that's where we are now uh flamingo

3268
00:59:44,549 --> 00:59:44,559
now that's where we are now uh flamingo
 

3269
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:47,430
now that's where we are now uh flamingo
expanded this to visual and language but

3270
00:59:47,430 --> 00:59:47,440
expanded this to visual and language but
 

3271
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:49,430
expanded this to visual and language but
it basically has the same abilities you

3272
00:59:49,430 --> 00:59:49,440
it basically has the same abilities you
 

3273
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:51,510
it basically has the same abilities you
can teach it for instance

3274
00:59:51,510 --> 00:59:51,520
can teach it for instance
 

3275
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:53,589
can teach it for instance
an emergent property was that you can

3276
00:59:53,589 --> 00:59:53,599
an emergent property was that you can
 

3277
00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:56,150
an emergent property was that you can
take pictures of numbers and then do do

3278
00:59:56,150 --> 00:59:56,160
take pictures of numbers and then do do
 

3279
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:58,390
take pictures of numbers and then do do
arithmetic with the numbers just by

3280
00:59:58,390 --> 00:59:58,400
arithmetic with the numbers just by
 

3281
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:00,470
arithmetic with the numbers just by
teaching it oh that's i mean when when i

3282
01:00:00,470 --> 01:00:00,480
teaching it oh that's i mean when when i
 

3283
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:02,309
teaching it oh that's i mean when when i
show you three plus six you know i want

3284
01:00:02,309 --> 01:00:02,319
show you three plus six you know i want
 

3285
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:05,030
show you three plus six you know i want
you to output nine and and you show it a

3286
01:00:05,030 --> 01:00:05,040
you to output nine and and you show it a
 

3287
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:07,349
you to output nine and and you show it a
few examples and now it does that so it

3288
01:00:07,349 --> 01:00:07,359
few examples and now it does that so it
 

3289
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:10,150
few examples and now it does that so it
went way beyond the oh this image net

3290
01:00:10,150 --> 01:00:10,160
went way beyond the oh this image net
 

3291
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:12,230
went way beyond the oh this image net
sort of category categorization of

3292
01:00:12,230 --> 01:00:12,240
sort of category categorization of
 

3293
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:14,150
sort of category categorization of
images that we were a bit stuck maybe

3294
01:00:14,150 --> 01:00:14,160
images that we were a bit stuck maybe
 

3295
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:16,150
images that we were a bit stuck maybe
before um this

3296
01:00:16,150 --> 01:00:16,160
before um this
 

3297
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:18,470
before um this
revelation moment that happened uh in

3298
01:00:18,470 --> 01:00:18,480
revelation moment that happened uh in
 

3299
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:21,190
revelation moment that happened uh in
2000 i believe it was 19 but it was

3300
01:00:21,190 --> 01:00:21,200
2000 i believe it was 19 but it was
 

3301
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,349
2000 i believe it was 19 but it was
after we chat and that way it has solved

3302
01:00:23,349 --> 01:00:23,359
after we chat and that way it has solved
 

3303
01:00:23,359 --> 01:00:25,990
after we chat and that way it has solved
metal learning as was previously defined

3304

yes it expanded what it meant so that's

3306
01:00:28,150 --> 01:00:28,160
yes it expanded what it meant so that's
 

3307
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:29,750
yes it expanded what it meant so that's
what you say what does it mean so it's

3308
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:29,760
what you say what does it mean so it's
 

3309
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:32,630
what you say what does it mean so it's
an evolving term um but here is

3310
01:00:32,630 --> 01:00:32,640
an evolving term um but here is
 

3311
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:35,670
an evolving term um but here is
maybe now looking forward looking at

3312
01:00:35,670 --> 01:00:35,680
maybe now looking forward looking at
 

3313
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:37,910
maybe now looking forward looking at
what's happening um you know obviously

3314
01:00:37,910 --> 01:00:37,920
what's happening um you know obviously
 

3315
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:41,349
what's happening um you know obviously
in the community with more modalities um

3316
01:00:41,349 --> 01:00:41,359
in the community with more modalities um
 

3317
01:00:41,359 --> 01:00:43,670
in the community with more modalities um
what we can expect and i would certainly

3318
01:00:43,670 --> 01:00:43,680
what we can expect and i would certainly
 

3319
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:45,430
what we can expect and i would certainly
hope to see the following and this is a

3320
01:00:45,430 --> 01:00:45,440
hope to see the following and this is a
 

3321
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:47,510
hope to see the following and this is a
pretty drastic

3322
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:47,520
pretty drastic
 

3323
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:50,309
pretty drastic
hope but in five years maybe we chat

3324
01:00:50,309 --> 01:00:50,319
hope but in five years maybe we chat
 

3325
01:00:50,319 --> 01:00:51,190
hope but in five years maybe we chat
again

3326
01:00:51,190 --> 01:00:51,200
again
 

3327
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:52,789
again
and

3328
01:00:52,789 --> 01:00:52,799
and
 

3329
01:00:52,799 --> 01:00:55,910
and
we have a system right a set of weights

3330
01:00:55,910 --> 01:00:55,920
we have a system right a set of weights
 

3331
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:56,870
we have a system right a set of weights
that

3332
01:00:56,870 --> 01:00:56,880
that
 

3333
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:59,750
that
we can teach it to play starcraft

3334
01:00:59,750 --> 01:00:59,760
we can teach it to play starcraft
 

3335
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:01,990
we can teach it to play starcraft
maybe not at the level of alpha star but

3336
01:01:01,990 --> 01:01:02,000
maybe not at the level of alpha star but
 

3337
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,990
maybe not at the level of alpha star but
play starcraft a complex game we teach

3338
01:01:03,990 --> 01:01:04,000
play starcraft a complex game we teach

01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,950
play starcraft a complex game we teach
it through interactions to prompting you

3340

it through interactions to prompting you
 

3341
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:08,630
it through interactions to prompting you
can certainly prompt a system that's

01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:10,630
can certainly prompt a system that's

this user did something good maybe the
 

3355
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:24,870
this user did something good maybe the
system can even play and ask you

01:01:24,870 --> 01:01:24,880
system can even play and ask you
 

3357

you teach me more so

3362
01:01:31,109 --> 01:01:31,119
you teach me more so
 

3363
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:33,190
you teach me more so
five maybe to ten years these

or what meta learning means will be much
more interactive much more rich and

specializing right so you see the
 

3375
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:44,230
specializing right so you see the
difference right we built alpha star

3376
01:01:44,230 --> 01:01:44,240
difference right we built alpha star
 

3377

to play starcraft the algorithms were
 

3381
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:50,309
to play starcraft the algorithms were
general but the weights were specialized

can teach a network to play games to

3386
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:55,760
can teach a network to play games to
 

3387
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:57,510
can teach a network to play games to
play any game just using games as an

01:01:57,510 --> 01:01:57,520
play any game just using games as an

3399
01:02:09,359 --> 01:02:11,349
details need to be to be filled and
research need to be done but that's how

01:02:11,349 --> 01:02:11,359
research need to be done but that's how
 

3401
01:02:11,359 --> 01:02:13,430

01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:15,670
i see metal learning above which is
gonna be beyond prompting it's gonna be

3404
01:02:15,670 --> 01:02:15,680
gonna be beyond prompting it's gonna be
 

3405
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:17,670
gonna be beyond prompting it's gonna be
a bit more interactive it's gonna you

3406
01:02:17,670 --> 01:02:17,680
a bit more interactive it's gonna you
 

3407
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:20,150
a bit more interactive it's gonna you
know the system might tell us to give it

3408
01:02:20,150 --> 01:02:20,160
know the system might tell us to give it
 

3409
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:22,150
know the system might tell us to give it
feedback after it maybe makes mistakes

nonetheless very exciting because if you

3414
01:02:27,270 --> 01:02:27,280
nonetheless very exciting because if you
 

3415
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:29,750
nonetheless very exciting because if you
think about this this way the benchmarks

3416
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:29,760
think about this this way the benchmarks
 

3417
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:31,670
think about this this way the benchmarks
are already there we just repurpose them

3418
01:02:31,670 --> 01:02:31,680
are already there we just repurpose them
 

3419
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:34,950
are already there we just repurpose them
the benchmarks right so in a way

3420
01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:34,960
the benchmarks right so in a way
 

3421
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:37,910
the benchmarks right so in a way
i like to map the space of

tasks
 

3435
01:02:54,319 --> 01:02:55,990
tasks
right and even if it's not as good it's

3436
01:02:55,990 --> 01:02:56,000
right and even if it's not as good it's
 

3437
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,789
right and even if it's not as good it's
fine we we actually we have ways to also

3438
01:02:58,789 --> 01:02:58,799
fine we we actually we have ways to also
 

3439
01:02:58,799 --> 01:03:00,710
fine we we actually we have ways to also
measure progress because we have those

3440
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:00,720
measure progress because we have those

special agents specialized agents um and

3442
01:03:03,670 --> 01:03:03,680
special agents specialized agents um and
 

3443
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:07,190
special agents specialized agents um and
so on so this is to me very exciting and

3444
01:03:07,190 --> 01:03:07,200
so on so this is to me very exciting and
 

3445
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:09,589
so on so this is to me very exciting and
these next iteration models are

3446
01:03:09,589 --> 01:03:09,599
these next iteration models are
 

3447
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:11,990
these next iteration models are
definitely hinting at that direction of

3448
01:03:11,990 --> 01:03:12,000
definitely hinting at that direction of
 

3449
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,630
definitely hinting at that direction of
progress um which hopefully we can have

3450
01:03:14,630 --> 01:03:14,640
progress um which hopefully we can have
 

3451
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:16,309
progress um which hopefully we can have
there are obviously some things that

3452
01:03:16,309 --> 01:03:16,319
there are obviously some things that
 

3453
01:03:16,319 --> 01:03:18,710
there are obviously some things that
could go wrong in terms of we might not

3454
01:03:18,710 --> 01:03:18,720
could go wrong in terms of we might not
 

3455
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:21,029
could go wrong in terms of we might not
have the tools maybe transformers are

3456
01:03:21,029 --> 01:03:21,039
have the tools maybe transformers are
 

3457
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:22,950
have the tools maybe transformers are
not enough then we must there's some

3458
01:03:22,950 --> 01:03:22,960
not enough then we must there's some
 

3459
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:25,270
not enough then we must there's some
breakthroughs to come which makes the

3460
01:03:25,270 --> 01:03:25,280
breakthroughs to come which makes the
 

3461
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:27,190
breakthroughs to come which makes the
field more exciting to people like me as

3462
01:03:27,190 --> 01:03:27,200
field more exciting to people like me as
 

3463
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:28,549
field more exciting to people like me as
well of course

3464
01:03:28,549 --> 01:03:28,559
well of course
 

3465
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:31,109
well of course
but that's if i if you ask me five to

3466
01:03:31,109 --> 01:03:31,119
but that's if i if you ask me five to
 

3467
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:33,190
but that's if i if you ask me five to
ten years you might see these models

01:03:33,190 --> 01:03:33,200
ten years you might see these models
 

3469
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:35,190
ten years you might see these models
that start to look more like

3470
01:03:35,190 --> 01:03:35,200
that start to look more like
 

3471
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:36,950
that start to look more like
weights that are already trained and

01:03:36,950 --> 01:03:36,960
weights that are already trained and
 

3473
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:37,829
weights that are already trained and
then

3474
01:03:37,829 --> 01:03:37,839
then
 

3475
01:03:37,839 --> 01:03:40,390
then
it's more about teaching are or make

3476
01:03:40,390 --> 01:03:40,400
it's more about teaching are or make

01:03:43,109 --> 01:03:43,119
you're trying um
 

3481
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:45,829
you're trying um
uh you're trying to to induce in terms

3482
01:03:45,829 --> 01:03:45,839
uh you're trying to to induce in terms
 

3483
01:03:45,839 --> 01:03:48,390
uh you're trying to to induce in terms
of tasks and so on well beyond the

3484
01:03:48,390 --> 01:03:48,400
of tasks and so on well beyond the
 

3485
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:50,470
of tasks and so on well beyond the
simple now tasks we're starting to see

3486
01:03:50,470 --> 01:03:50,480
simple now tasks we're starting to see
 

3487
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:52,630
simple now tasks we're starting to see
emerge like you know small arithmetic

3488
01:03:52,630 --> 01:03:52,640
emerge like you know small arithmetic
 

3489
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:55,029
emerge like you know small arithmetic
tasks and so on so a few questions

3490
01:03:55,029 --> 01:03:55,039
tasks and so on so a few questions
 

3491
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:58,950
tasks and so on so a few questions
around that this is fascinating uh so

3492
01:03:58,950 --> 01:03:58,960
around that this is fascinating uh so
 

3493
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:01,510
around that this is fascinating uh so
that kind of teaching interactive not so

3494
01:04:01,510 --> 01:04:01,520
that kind of teaching interactive not so
 

3495
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:03,589
that kind of teaching interactive not so
it's beyond prompting says interacting

3496
01:04:03,589 --> 01:04:03,599
it's beyond prompting says interacting
 

3497
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:05,109
it's beyond prompting says interacting
with the neural network

3498
01:04:05,109 --> 01:04:05,119
with the neural network
 

3499
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:06,950
with the neural network
that's different than the training

3500
01:04:06,950 --> 01:04:06,960
that's different than the training
 

3501
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:08,230
that's different than the training
process

3502
01:04:08,230 --> 01:04:08,240
process
 

3503
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:11,430
process
so it's different than the

3504
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:11,440

 

3505
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:14,470

optimization over differentiable

01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:17,280
uh functions this is already trained and
 

3509
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:19,750
uh functions this is already trained and
now you're teaching

3510
01:04:19,750 --> 01:04:19,760
now you're teaching
 

3511
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:21,510
now you're teaching
i mean um

3512
01:04:21,510 --> 01:04:21,520
i mean um
 

3513
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:24,150
i mean um
it's almost like akin to the brain then

3514
01:04:24,150 --> 01:04:24,160
it's almost like akin to the brain then
 

3515
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:26,150
it's almost like akin to the brain then
the the neurons already set with their

3516
01:04:26,150 --> 01:04:26,160
the the neurons already set with their
 

3517
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:28,630
the the neurons already set with their
connections on top of that you know

3518
01:04:28,630 --> 01:04:28,640
connections on top of that you know
 

3519
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:30,710
connections on top of that you know
using that infrastructure to build up

3520
01:04:30,710 --> 01:04:30,720
using that infrastructure to build up
 

3521
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:32,549
using that infrastructure to build up
further knowledge

3522
01:04:32,549 --> 01:04:32,559
further knowledge
 

3523
01:04:32,559 --> 01:04:33,589
further knowledge
okay

3524
01:04:33,589 --> 01:04:33,599
okay
 

3525
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:34,950
okay
so

3526
01:04:34,950 --> 01:04:34,960
so
 

3527
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:36,549
so
that's a really interesting distinction

3528
01:04:36,549 --> 01:04:36,559
that's a really interesting distinction
 

3529
01:04:36,559 --> 01:04:38,150
that's a really interesting distinction
that's actually not obvious from a

01:04:38,150 --> 01:04:38,160
that's actually not obvious from a
 

3531
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:40,309
that's actually not obvious from a
software engineering perspective that

3532
01:04:40,309 --> 01:04:40,319
software engineering perspective that
 

3533
01:04:40,319 --> 01:04:42,630
software engineering perspective that
there's a line to be drawn

3534
01:04:42,630 --> 01:04:42,640
there's a line to be drawn
 

3535
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:43,910
there's a line to be drawn
because you always think for a neural

trained and retrained

3540
01:04:48,230 --> 01:04:48,240
trained and retrained
 

3541
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:49,829
trained and retrained
but maybe

teaching and you'll now work a little

3546
01:04:54,950 --> 01:04:54,960
teaching and you'll now work a little
 

3547
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:56,710
teaching and you'll now work a little
bit of context about whatever the heck

3548
01:04:56,710 --> 01:04:56,720
bit of context about whatever the heck
 

3549
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:58,549
bit of context about whatever the heck
you're trying it to do so you can maybe

3550
01:04:58,549 --> 01:04:58,559
you're trying it to do so you can maybe
 

3551
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:01,270
you're trying it to do so you can maybe
expand this prompting capability by

3552
01:05:01,270 --> 01:05:01,280
expand this prompting capability by
 

3553
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:03,829
expand this prompting capability by
um making it interact that's really

3554
01:05:03,829 --> 01:05:03,839
um making it interact that's really
 

3555
01:05:03,839 --> 01:05:06,390
um making it interact that's really
really yeah by the way this is not if

3556
01:05:06,390 --> 01:05:06,400
really yeah by the way this is not if
 

3557
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:08,789
really yeah by the way this is not if
you look at way back um at different

3558
01:05:08,789 --> 01:05:08,799
you look at way back um at different
 

3559
01:05:08,799 --> 01:05:11,750
you look at way back um at different
ways to tackle even classification tasks

3560
01:05:11,750 --> 01:05:11,760
ways to tackle even classification tasks
 

3561
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:14,789
ways to tackle even classification tasks
so this this is this comes from from

3562
01:05:14,789 --> 01:05:14,799
so this this is this comes from from
 

3563
01:05:14,799 --> 01:05:16,789
so this this is this comes from from
like long-standing literature in machine

3564
01:05:16,789 --> 01:05:16,799
like long-standing literature in machine
 

3565
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:19,829
like long-standing literature in machine
learning um what i'm suggesting could

3566
01:05:19,829 --> 01:05:19,839
learning um what i'm suggesting could
 

3567
01:05:19,839 --> 01:05:22,710
learning um what i'm suggesting could
sound to some like a bit like um nearest

3568
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:22,720
sound to some like a bit like um nearest
 

3569
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:24,630
sound to some like a bit like um nearest
neighbor so nida's neighbor is almost

3570
01:05:24,630 --> 01:05:24,640
neighbor so nida's neighbor is almost
 

3571
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:26,470
neighbor so nida's neighbor is almost
the simplest algorithm

3572
01:05:26,470 --> 01:05:26,480
the simplest algorithm
 

3573
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:28,309
the simplest algorithm
uh that you can

3574
01:05:28,309 --> 01:05:28,319
uh that you can
 

3575
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:30,630
uh that you can
that does not require learning so it has

3576
01:05:30,630 --> 01:05:30,640
that does not require learning so it has
 

3577
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:33,029
that does not require learning so it has
this interesting like you don't need to

3578
01:05:33,029 --> 01:05:33,039
this interesting like you don't need to
 

3579
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:34,950
this interesting like you don't need to
compute gradients and what nearest

3580
01:05:34,950 --> 01:05:34,960
compute gradients and what nearest
 

3581
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:37,670
compute gradients and what nearest
neighbor does is you quote unquote have

3582
01:05:37,670 --> 01:05:37,680
neighbor does is you quote unquote have
 

3583
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:40,549
neighbor does is you quote unquote have
a data set or upload a data set and then

3584
01:05:40,549 --> 01:05:40,559
a data set or upload a data set and then
 

3585
01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:42,470
a data set or upload a data set and then
all you need to do is a way to measure

3586
01:05:42,470 --> 01:05:42,480
all you need to do is a way to measure
 

3587
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:45,430
all you need to do is a way to measure
distance between points and then to

3588
01:05:45,430 --> 01:05:45,440
distance between points and then to
 

3589
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:47,510
distance between points and then to
classify a new point you're just simply

3590
01:05:47,510 --> 01:05:47,520
classify a new point you're just simply
 

3591
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:49,270
classify a new point you're just simply
computing what's the closest point in

3592
01:05:49,270 --> 01:05:49,280
computing what's the closest point in
 

3593
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:51,589
computing what's the closest point in
this massive amount of data and that's

3594
01:05:51,589 --> 01:05:51,599
this massive amount of data and that's
 

3595
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:54,470
this massive amount of data and that's
my answer so you can think of prompting

3596
01:05:54,470 --> 01:05:54,480
my answer so you can think of prompting
 

3597
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:57,589
my answer so you can think of prompting
in a way as you're uploading not not

3598
01:05:57,589 --> 01:05:57,599
in a way as you're uploading not not
 

3599
01:05:57,599 --> 01:06:00,309
in a way as you're uploading not not
just simple points and and you know the

3600
01:06:00,309 --> 01:06:00,319
just simple points and and you know the
 

3601
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:01,990
just simple points and and you know the
metric is not the distance between the

3602
01:06:01,990 --> 01:06:02,000
metric is not the distance between the
 

3603
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,510
metric is not the distance between the
images or something simple it's

3604
01:06:03,510 --> 01:06:03,520
images or something simple it's
 

3605
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:05,270
images or something simple it's
something that you compute that's much

3606
01:06:05,270 --> 01:06:05,280
something that you compute that's much
 

3607
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:07,589
something that you compute that's much
more advanced but in a way it's very

3608
01:06:07,589 --> 01:06:07,599
more advanced but in a way it's very
 

3609
01:06:07,599 --> 01:06:10,390
more advanced but in a way it's very
similar right you you simply are

3610
01:06:10,390 --> 01:06:10,400
similar right you you simply are
 

3611
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:11,829
similar right you you simply are
uploading some

3612
01:06:11,829 --> 01:06:11,839
uploading some
 

3613
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:14,150
uploading some
knowledge to this pre-trained system in

3614
01:06:14,150 --> 01:06:14,160
knowledge to this pre-trained system in
 

3615
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:16,390
knowledge to this pre-trained system in
nearest neighbor maybe the metric is

3616
01:06:16,390 --> 01:06:16,400
nearest neighbor maybe the metric is
 

3617
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:18,230
nearest neighbor maybe the metric is
learned or not but you don't need to

3618
01:06:18,230 --> 01:06:18,240
learned or not but you don't need to
 

3619
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:20,309
learned or not but you don't need to
further train it and then now you

3620
01:06:20,309 --> 01:06:20,319
further train it and then now you
 

3621
01:06:20,319 --> 01:06:22,309
further train it and then now you
immediately get a classifier

3622
01:06:22,309 --> 01:06:22,319
immediately get a classifier
 

3623
01:06:22,319 --> 01:06:24,390
immediately get a classifier
out of this right now it's just an

3624
01:06:24,390 --> 01:06:24,400
out of this right now it's just an
 

3625
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:26,549
out of this right now it's just an
evolution of that concept very classical

3626
01:06:26,549 --> 01:06:26,559
evolution of that concept very classical
 

3627
01:06:26,559 --> 01:06:29,270
evolution of that concept very classical
concept in machine learning which is um

3628
01:06:29,270 --> 01:06:29,280
concept in machine learning which is um
 

3629
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:31,270
concept in machine learning which is um
yeah just learning through what's the

3630
01:06:31,270 --> 01:06:31,280
yeah just learning through what's the
 

3631
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:33,589
yeah just learning through what's the
closest point closes by some distance

3632
01:06:33,589 --> 01:06:33,599
closest point closes by some distance
 

3633
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:35,829
closest point closes by some distance
and that's it yeah it's an evolution of

3634
01:06:35,829 --> 01:06:35,839
and that's it yeah it's an evolution of
 

3635
01:06:35,839 --> 01:06:37,270
and that's it yeah it's an evolution of
that and i will say

3636
01:06:37,270 --> 01:06:37,280
that and i will say
 

3637
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:39,589
that and i will say
how how i saw metal learning when we

3638
01:06:39,589 --> 01:06:39,599
how how i saw metal learning when we
 

3639
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:44,150
how how i saw metal learning when we
worked um on a few ideas in in 2016 was

3640
01:06:44,150 --> 01:06:44,160
worked um on a few ideas in in 2016 was
 

3641
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:46,470
worked um on a few ideas in in 2016 was
precisely through the lens of

3642
01:06:46,470 --> 01:06:46,480
precisely through the lens of
 

3643
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:48,309
precisely through the lens of
nearest neighbor which is very common in

3644
01:06:48,309 --> 01:06:48,319
nearest neighbor which is very common in
 

3645
01:06:48,319 --> 01:06:50,230
nearest neighbor which is very common in
computer vision community right there's

3646
01:06:50,230 --> 01:06:50,240
computer vision community right there's
 

3647
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:52,870
computer vision community right there's
a very active area of research about how

3648
01:06:52,870 --> 01:06:52,880
a very active area of research about how
 

3649
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:54,950
a very active area of research about how
do you compute the distance between two

3650
01:06:54,950 --> 01:06:54,960
do you compute the distance between two
 

3651
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:56,710
do you compute the distance between two
images but if you have a good distance

3652
01:06:56,710 --> 01:06:56,720
images but if you have a good distance
 

3653
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:58,630
images but if you have a good distance
metric you you also have a good

3654
01:06:58,630 --> 01:06:58,640
metric you you also have a good
 

3655
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:00,710
metric you you also have a good
classifier right all i'm saying is now

3656
01:07:00,710 --> 01:07:00,720
classifier right all i'm saying is now
 

3657
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:02,710
classifier right all i'm saying is now
these distances and and the points are

3658
01:07:02,710 --> 01:07:02,720
these distances and and the points are
 

3659
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:04,789
these distances and and the points are
not just images they're like

3660
01:07:04,789 --> 01:07:04,799
not just images they're like
 

3661
01:07:04,799 --> 01:07:07,190
not just images they're like
words or sequences of

3662
01:07:07,190 --> 01:07:07,200
words or sequences of
 

3663
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:09,589
words or sequences of
words and images and actions that teach

3664
01:07:09,589 --> 01:07:09,599
words and images and actions that teach
 

3665
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:11,029
words and images and actions that teach
you something new but

3666
01:07:11,029 --> 01:07:11,039
you something new but
 

3667
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:13,270
you something new but
it might be that technique wise

3668
01:07:13,270 --> 01:07:13,280
it might be that technique wise
 

3669
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:16,950
it might be that technique wise
those come back and i will say that it's

3670
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:16,960
those come back and i will say that it's
 

3671
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:19,430
those come back and i will say that it's
not necessarily true that you might not

3672
01:07:19,430 --> 01:07:19,440
not necessarily true that you might not
 

3673
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:21,829
not necessarily true that you might not
ever train the weights a bit further

3674
01:07:21,829 --> 01:07:21,839
ever train the weights a bit further
 

3675
01:07:21,839 --> 01:07:24,069
ever train the weights a bit further
some aspect of metal learning some

3676
01:07:24,069 --> 01:07:24,079
some aspect of metal learning some
 

3677
01:07:24,079 --> 01:07:26,069
some aspect of metal learning some
techniques in metal learning

3678
01:07:26,069 --> 01:07:26,079
techniques in metal learning
 

3679
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:28,309
techniques in metal learning
do actually do a bit of fine tuning as

3680
01:07:28,309 --> 01:07:28,319
do actually do a bit of fine tuning as
 

3681
01:07:28,319 --> 01:07:30,309
do actually do a bit of fine tuning as
it's called right they train the weights

3682
01:07:30,309 --> 01:07:30,319
it's called right they train the weights
 

3683
01:07:30,319 --> 01:07:33,910
it's called right they train the weights
a little bit when they get a new task so

3684
01:07:33,910 --> 01:07:33,920
a little bit when they get a new task so
 

3685
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:36,069
a little bit when they get a new task so
as i call the how or or how we're gonna

3686
01:07:36,069 --> 01:07:36,079
as i call the how or or how we're gonna
 

3687
01:07:36,079 --> 01:07:37,510
as i call the how or or how we're gonna
achieve this

3688
01:07:37,510 --> 01:07:37,520
achieve this
 

3689
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:39,670
achieve this
um as a deep learner i'm very skeptic

3690
01:07:39,670 --> 01:07:39,680
um as a deep learner i'm very skeptic
 

3691
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:41,430
um as a deep learner i'm very skeptic
we're gonna try a few things whether

3692
01:07:41,430 --> 01:07:41,440
we're gonna try a few things whether
 

3693
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:43,109
we're gonna try a few things whether
it's a bit of training adding a few

3694
01:07:43,109 --> 01:07:43,119
it's a bit of training adding a few
 

3695
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:45,270
it's a bit of training adding a few
parameters thinking of this as nearest

3696
01:07:45,270 --> 01:07:45,280
parameters thinking of this as nearest
 

3697
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:46,870
parameters thinking of this as nearest
neighbor or just

3698
01:07:46,870 --> 01:07:46,880
neighbor or just
 

3699
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:48,630
neighbor or just
simply thinking of there's a sequence of

3700
01:07:48,630 --> 01:07:48,640
simply thinking of there's a sequence of
 

3701
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:50,390
simply thinking of there's a sequence of
words it's a prefix

3702
01:07:50,390 --> 01:07:50,400
words it's a prefix
 

3703
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,870
words it's a prefix
and that's the new classifier

3704
01:07:52,870 --> 01:07:52,880
and that's the new classifier
 

3705
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:54,470
and that's the new classifier
we'll see right there's there's the

3706
01:07:54,470 --> 01:07:54,480
we'll see right there's there's the
 

3707
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:56,870
we'll see right there's there's the
beauty of research but um but what's

3708
01:07:56,870 --> 01:07:56,880
beauty of research but um but what's
 

3709
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:59,430
beauty of research but um but what's
what's important is that is a good goal

3710
01:07:59,430 --> 01:07:59,440
what's important is that is a good goal
 

3711
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:02,150
what's important is that is a good goal
in itself that i see as very worthwhile

3712
01:08:02,150 --> 01:08:02,160
in itself that i see as very worthwhile
 

3713
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:04,630
in itself that i see as very worthwhile
pursuing for the next stages of

3714
01:08:04,630 --> 01:08:04,640
pursuing for the next stages of
 

3715
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:06,309
pursuing for the next stages of
not only meta learning i think this is

3716
01:08:06,309 --> 01:08:06,319
not only meta learning i think this is
 

3717
01:08:06,319 --> 01:08:07,589
not only meta learning i think this is
basically

3718
01:08:07,589 --> 01:08:07,599
basically
 

3719
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:10,069
basically
what's exciting about machine learning

3720
01:08:10,069 --> 01:08:10,079
what's exciting about machine learning
 

3721
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:12,390
what's exciting about machine learning
period to me well the and then the

3722
01:08:12,390 --> 01:08:12,400
period to me well the and then the
 

3723
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:14,390
period to me well the and then the
interactive aspect of that is also very

3724
01:08:14,390 --> 01:08:14,400
interactive aspect of that is also very
 

3725
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:16,309
interactive aspect of that is also very
interesting the interactive version of

3726
01:08:16,309 --> 01:08:16,319
interesting the interactive version of
 

3727
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:18,309
interesting the interactive version of
nearest neighbor

3728
01:08:18,309 --> 01:08:18,319
nearest neighbor
 

3729
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:20,149
nearest neighbor
yeah to help you uh

3730
01:08:20,149 --> 01:08:20,159
yeah to help you uh
 

3731
01:08:20,159 --> 01:08:21,349
yeah to help you uh
pull out the

3732
01:08:21,349 --> 01:08:21,359
pull out the
 

3733
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:23,669
pull out the
classifier from this giant thing

3734
01:08:23,669 --> 01:08:23,679
classifier from this giant thing
 

3735
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:24,390
classifier from this giant thing
okay

3736
01:08:24,390 --> 01:08:24,400
okay
 

3737
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:27,910
okay
uh is is this the way we can go in five

3738
01:08:27,910 --> 01:08:27,920
uh is is this the way we can go in five
 

3739
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:28,789
uh is is this the way we can go in five
ten

3740
01:08:28,789 --> 01:08:28,799
ten
 

3741
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:30,630
ten
plus years

3742
01:08:30,630 --> 01:08:30,640
plus years
 

3743
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:34,070
plus years
uh from any task so sorry from many

3744
01:08:34,070 --> 01:08:34,080
uh from any task so sorry from many
 

3745
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:36,829
uh from any task so sorry from many
tasks to any task

3746
01:08:36,829 --> 01:08:36,839
tasks to any task
 

3747
01:08:36,839 --> 01:08:39,510
tasks to any task
so and what does that mean like what

3748
01:08:39,510 --> 01:08:39,520
so and what does that mean like what
 

3749
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:42,709
so and what does that mean like what
does it need to be actually trained on

3750
01:08:42,709 --> 01:08:42,719
does it need to be actually trained on
 

3751
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:45,349
does it need to be actually trained on
which point is the network had enough

3752
01:08:45,349 --> 01:08:45,359
which point is the network had enough
 

3753
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:47,590
which point is the network had enough
so what um

3754
01:08:47,590 --> 01:08:47,600
so what um
 

3755
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:49,669
so what um
what does a network need to learn about

3756
01:08:49,669 --> 01:08:49,679
what does a network need to learn about
 

3757
01:08:49,679 --> 01:08:51,189
what does a network need to learn about
this world in order to be able to

3758
01:08:51,189 --> 01:08:51,199
this world in order to be able to
 

3759
01:08:51,199 --> 01:08:54,470
this world in order to be able to
perform any task is it just as simple as

3760
01:08:54,470 --> 01:08:54,480
perform any task is it just as simple as
 

3761
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:55,829
perform any task is it just as simple as
language

3762
01:08:55,829 --> 01:08:55,839
language
 

3763
01:08:55,839 --> 01:08:58,870
language
image and action or do you need

3764
01:08:58,870 --> 01:08:58,880
image and action or do you need
 

3765
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:02,229
image and action or do you need
some set of representative images

3766
01:09:02,229 --> 01:09:02,239
some set of representative images
 

3767
01:09:02,239 --> 01:09:03,349
some set of representative images
uh like

3768
01:09:03,349 --> 01:09:03,359
uh like
 

3769
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:05,269
uh like
if you only see land images will you

3770
01:09:05,269 --> 01:09:05,279
if you only see land images will you
 

3771
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:06,950
if you only see land images will you
know anything about underwater is that

3772
01:09:06,950 --> 01:09:06,960
know anything about underwater is that
 

3773
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:08,870
know anything about underwater is that
somehow fundamentally different i don't

3774
01:09:08,870 --> 01:09:08,880
somehow fundamentally different i don't
 

3775
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:10,870
somehow fundamentally different i don't
know those i mean those are upward

3776
01:09:10,870 --> 01:09:10,880
know those i mean those are upward
 

3777
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,709
know those i mean those are upward
questions i would say i mean the way you

3778
01:09:12,709 --> 01:09:12,719
questions i would say i mean the way you
 

3779
01:09:12,719 --> 01:09:14,950
questions i would say i mean the way you
put let me maybe further your example

3780
01:09:14,950 --> 01:09:14,960
put let me maybe further your example
 

3781
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:18,229
put let me maybe further your example
right if if all you see is land images

3782
01:09:18,229 --> 01:09:18,239
right if if all you see is land images
 

3783
01:09:18,239 --> 01:09:20,709
right if if all you see is land images
but you're reading all about land and

3784
01:09:20,709 --> 01:09:20,719
but you're reading all about land and
 

3785
01:09:20,719 --> 01:09:23,030
but you're reading all about land and
water worlds but in books right imagine

3786
01:09:23,030 --> 01:09:23,040
water worlds but in books right imagine
 

3787
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:23,749
water worlds but in books right imagine
like

3788
01:09:23,749 --> 01:09:23,759
like
 

3789
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:25,510
like
would that be enough i mean good

3790
01:09:25,510 --> 01:09:25,520
would that be enough i mean good
 

3791
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:28,550
would that be enough i mean good
question we don't know but i guess maybe

3792
01:09:28,550 --> 01:09:28,560
question we don't know but i guess maybe
 

3793
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:30,470
question we don't know but i guess maybe
you can you can you can join us if you

3794
01:09:30,470 --> 01:09:30,480
you can you can you can join us if you
 

3795
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:32,229
you can you can you can join us if you
want in our quest to find this that's

3796
01:09:32,229 --> 01:09:32,239
want in our quest to find this that's
 

3797
01:09:32,239 --> 01:09:34,550
want in our quest to find this that's
that's precisely water world yeah yes

3798
01:09:34,550 --> 01:09:34,560
that's precisely water world yeah yes
 

3799
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:36,950
that's precisely water world yeah yes
that's precisely i mean the beauty of

3800
01:09:36,950 --> 01:09:36,960
that's precisely i mean the beauty of
 

3801
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:38,470
that's precisely i mean the beauty of
research and and

3802
01:09:38,470 --> 01:09:38,480
research and and
 

3803
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:41,189
research and and
that's the the the the

3804
01:09:41,189 --> 01:09:41,199
that's the the the the
 

3805
01:09:41,199 --> 01:09:42,870
that's the the the the
the research business we're in i guess

3806
01:09:42,870 --> 01:09:42,880
the research business we're in i guess
 

3807
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:45,189
the research business we're in i guess
is to figure this out and ask the right

3808
01:09:45,189 --> 01:09:45,199
is to figure this out and ask the right
 

3809
01:09:45,199 --> 01:09:47,749
is to figure this out and ask the right
questions and then iterate with with the

3810
01:09:47,749 --> 01:09:47,759
questions and then iterate with with the
 

3811
01:09:47,759 --> 01:09:49,030
questions and then iterate with with the
whole community

3812
01:09:49,030 --> 01:09:49,040
whole community
 

3813
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:50,870
whole community
um publishing like

3814
01:09:50,870 --> 01:09:50,880
um publishing like
 

3815
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:53,269
um publishing like
findings and so on uh but yeah these are

3816
01:09:53,269 --> 01:09:53,279
findings and so on uh but yeah these are
 

3817
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:55,590
findings and so on uh but yeah these are
this is a question it's not the only

3818
01:09:55,590 --> 01:09:55,600
this is a question it's not the only
 

3819
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:57,430
this is a question it's not the only
question but it's certainly as you ask

3820
01:09:57,430 --> 01:09:57,440
question but it's certainly as you ask
 

3821
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:00,310
question but it's certainly as you ask
is is on my mind constantly right and so

3822
01:10:00,310 --> 01:10:00,320
is is on my mind constantly right and so
 

3823
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:02,390
is is on my mind constantly right and so
we'll we'll need to wait for

3824
01:10:02,390 --> 01:10:02,400
we'll we'll need to wait for
 

3825
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:04,390
we'll we'll need to wait for
maybe the let's say five years let's

3826
01:10:04,390 --> 01:10:04,400
maybe the let's say five years let's
 

3827
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:07,030
maybe the let's say five years let's
hope it's it's not 10 to to see what

3828
01:10:07,030 --> 01:10:07,040
hope it's it's not 10 to to see what
 

3829
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:09,270
hope it's it's not 10 to to see what
what are the answers um

3830
01:10:09,270 --> 01:10:09,280
what are the answers um
 

3831
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:11,750
what are the answers um
some people will largely believe in

3832
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:11,760
some people will largely believe in
 

3833
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:13,750
some people will largely believe in
unsupervised or self-supervised learning

3834
01:10:13,750 --> 01:10:13,760
unsupervised or self-supervised learning
 

3835
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:15,510
unsupervised or self-supervised learning
of single modalities

3836
01:10:15,510 --> 01:10:15,520
of single modalities
 

3837
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:17,910
of single modalities
and then crossing them

3838
01:10:17,910 --> 01:10:17,920
and then crossing them
 

3839
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:19,590
and then crossing them
some people might think end-to-end

3840
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:19,600
some people might think end-to-end
 

3841
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:22,709
some people might think end-to-end
learning is the answer um modularity is

3842
01:10:22,709 --> 01:10:22,719
learning is the answer um modularity is
 

3843
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:25,590
learning is the answer um modularity is
maybe the answer so we don't know but

3844
01:10:25,590 --> 01:10:25,600
maybe the answer so we don't know but
 

3845
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:27,270
maybe the answer so we don't know but
we're just definitely excited to find

3846
01:10:27,270 --> 01:10:27,280
we're just definitely excited to find
 

3847
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:28,709
we're just definitely excited to find
out but it feels like this is the right

3848
01:10:28,709 --> 01:10:28,719
out but it feels like this is the right
 

3849
01:10:28,719 --> 01:10:31,030
out but it feels like this is the right
time and we're at the beginning of this

3850
01:10:31,030 --> 01:10:31,040
time and we're at the beginning of this
 

3851
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:32,870
time and we're at the beginning of this
yeah we're finally ready to do these

3852
01:10:32,870 --> 01:10:32,880
yeah we're finally ready to do these
 

3853
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:34,709
yeah we're finally ready to do these
kind of general

3854
01:10:34,709 --> 01:10:34,719
kind of general

what do you sort of specific technical

3858
01:10:41,830 --> 01:10:41,840
what do you sort of specific technical
 

3859
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:45,189
what do you sort of specific technical
thing about gato flamingo

chinchilla

3862
01:10:46,550 --> 01:10:46,560
chinchilla
 

3863
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:48,870
chinchilla
gopher any of these that is especially

3864
01:10:48,870 --> 01:10:48,880
gopher any of these that is especially
 

3865
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:51,030
gopher any of these that is especially
beautiful that was surprising

3866
01:10:51,030 --> 01:10:51,040
beautiful that was surprising
 

3867
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:53,270
beautiful that was surprising
maybe is there something that just jumps

3868
01:10:53,270 --> 01:10:53,280
maybe is there something that just jumps
 

3869
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:55,110
maybe is there something that just jumps
out at you

3870
01:10:55,110 --> 01:10:55,120
out at you
 

3871
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:56,709
out at you
of course there's the general thing of

3872
01:10:56,709 --> 01:10:56,719
of course there's the general thing of
 

3873
01:10:56,719 --> 01:10:58,790
of course there's the general thing of
like you didn't think it was possible

3874
01:10:58,790 --> 01:10:58,800
like you didn't think it was possible
 

3875
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:00,310
like you didn't think it was possible
and then

3876
01:11:00,310 --> 01:11:00,320
and then
 

3877
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:02,390
and then
you realize it's possible in terms of

3878
01:11:02,390 --> 01:11:02,400
you realize it's possible in terms of
 

3879
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:04,310
you realize it's possible in terms of
the generalizability across modalities

3880
01:11:04,310 --> 01:11:04,320
the generalizability across modalities
 

3881
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:06,390
the generalizability across modalities
and all that kind of stuff or maybe the

3882
01:11:06,390 --> 01:11:06,400
and all that kind of stuff or maybe the
 

3883
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:08,390
and all that kind of stuff or maybe the
how small of a network relatively

3884
01:11:08,390 --> 01:11:08,400
how small of a network relatively
 

3885
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:10,310
how small of a network relatively
speaking god was all that kind of stuff

3886
01:11:10,310 --> 01:11:10,320
speaking god was all that kind of stuff
 

3887
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:12,790
speaking god was all that kind of stuff
but is there some weird

3888
01:11:12,790 --> 01:11:12,800
but is there some weird
 

3889
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:15,110
but is there some weird
little things that were surprising

3890
01:11:15,110 --> 01:11:15,120
little things that were surprising
 

3891
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:16,310
little things that were surprising
look i

3892
01:11:16,310 --> 01:11:16,320
look i
 

3893
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:17,590
look i
i'll give you an answer that's very

3894
01:11:17,590 --> 01:11:17,600
i'll give you an answer that's very
 

3895
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:19,189
i'll give you an answer that's very
important because

3896
01:11:19,189 --> 01:11:19,199
important because
 

3897
01:11:19,199 --> 01:11:21,189
important because
maybe people

3898
01:11:21,189 --> 01:11:21,199
maybe people
 

3899
01:11:21,199 --> 01:11:23,669
maybe people
don't quite realize this but

3900
01:11:23,669 --> 01:11:23,679
don't quite realize this but
 

3901
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:25,750
don't quite realize this but
the teams behind these efforts the

3902
01:11:25,750 --> 01:11:25,760
the teams behind these efforts the
 

3903
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:27,910
the teams behind these efforts the
actual humans yeah that's maybe the

3904
01:11:27,910 --> 01:11:27,920
actual humans yeah that's maybe the
 

3905
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:29,189
actual humans yeah that's maybe the
surprising

3906
01:11:29,189 --> 01:11:29,199
surprising
 

3907
01:11:29,199 --> 01:11:32,550
surprising
um you know obviously positive way so

3908
01:11:32,550 --> 01:11:32,560
um you know obviously positive way so
 

3909
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:33,910
um you know obviously positive way so
anytime you see these these

3910
01:11:33,910 --> 01:11:33,920
anytime you see these these
 

3911
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:35,750
anytime you see these these
breakthroughs i mean it's easy to map it

3912
01:11:35,750 --> 01:11:35,760
breakthroughs i mean it's easy to map it
 

3913
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:37,910
breakthroughs i mean it's easy to map it
to a few people there's people that are

3914
01:11:37,910 --> 01:11:37,920
to a few people there's people that are
 

3915
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:39,750
to a few people there's people that are
great at explaining things and so on

3916
01:11:39,750 --> 01:11:39,760
great at explaining things and so on
 

3917
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:41,590
great at explaining things and so on
that's very nice but

3918
01:11:41,590 --> 01:11:41,600
that's very nice but
 

3919
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:43,830
that's very nice but
maybe the the the learnings or the

3920
01:11:43,830 --> 01:11:43,840
maybe the the the learnings or the
 

3921
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:45,830
maybe the the the learnings or the
method learnings that i get as a human

3922
01:11:45,830 --> 01:11:45,840
method learnings that i get as a human
 

3923
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:48,229
method learnings that i get as a human
about this is um sure we can move

3924
01:11:48,229 --> 01:11:48,239
about this is um sure we can move
 

3925
01:11:48,239 --> 01:11:49,990
about this is um sure we can move
forward um

3926
01:11:49,990 --> 01:11:50,000
forward um
 

3927
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,830
forward um
and but the surprising bit is

3928
01:11:52,830 --> 01:11:52,840
and but the surprising bit is
 

3929
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:54,709
and but the surprising bit is
how

3930
01:11:54,709 --> 01:11:54,719
how
 

3931
01:11:54,719 --> 01:11:57,189
how
how important are all the pieces of of

3932
01:11:57,189 --> 01:11:57,199
how important are all the pieces of of
 

3933
01:11:57,199 --> 01:11:58,630
how important are all the pieces of of
these projects

3934
01:11:58,630 --> 01:11:58,640
these projects
 

3935
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:00,630
these projects
how do they come together so i'll give

3936
01:12:00,630 --> 01:12:00,640
how do they come together so i'll give
 

3937
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:01,430
how do they come together so i'll give
you

3938
01:12:01,430 --> 01:12:01,440
you
 

3939
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:03,750
you
uh maybe some of the ingredients of

3940
01:12:03,750 --> 01:12:03,760
uh maybe some of the ingredients of
 

3941
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:06,310
uh maybe some of the ingredients of
success that are common across these um

3942
01:12:06,310 --> 01:12:06,320
success that are common across these um
 

3943
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:07,990
success that are common across these um
but not the obvious ones and machine

3944
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:08,000
but not the obvious ones and machine
 

3945
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,709
but not the obvious ones and machine
learning i i can always always also give

3946
01:12:10,709 --> 01:12:10,719
learning i i can always always also give
 

3947
01:12:10,719 --> 01:12:12,229
learning i i can always always also give
you those but

3948
01:12:12,229 --> 01:12:12,239
you those but
 

3949
01:12:12,239 --> 01:12:13,510
you those but
basically

3950
01:12:13,510 --> 01:12:13,520
basically
 

3951
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:15,270
basically
there is

3952
01:12:15,270 --> 01:12:15,280
there is
 

3953
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:18,310
there is
engineering is critical so so very good

3954
01:12:18,310 --> 01:12:18,320
engineering is critical so so very good
 

3955
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:21,030
engineering is critical so so very good
engineering uh because ultimately we're

3956
01:12:21,030 --> 01:12:21,040
engineering uh because ultimately we're
 

3957
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:24,470
engineering uh because ultimately we're
collecting um data sets right so the the

3958
01:12:24,470 --> 01:12:24,480
collecting um data sets right so the the
 

3959
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:26,870
collecting um data sets right so the the
engineering of data and then of

3960
01:12:26,870 --> 01:12:26,880
engineering of data and then of
 

3961
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:29,910
engineering of data and then of
deploying the models at scale um into

3962
01:12:29,910 --> 01:12:29,920
deploying the models at scale um into
 

3963
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:31,990
deploying the models at scale um into
some compute cluster that cannot go

3964
01:12:31,990 --> 01:12:32,000
some compute cluster that cannot go
 

3965
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,950
some compute cluster that cannot go
understated that is a huge factor of

3966
01:12:34,950 --> 01:12:34,960
understated that is a huge factor of
 

3967
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:36,709
understated that is a huge factor of
success

3968
01:12:36,709 --> 01:12:36,719
success
 

3969
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:38,870
success
and it's hard to believe that

3970
01:12:38,870 --> 01:12:38,880
and it's hard to believe that
 

3971
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:41,669
and it's hard to believe that
details matter so much

3972
01:12:41,669 --> 01:12:41,679
details matter so much
 

3973
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:43,910
details matter so much
we would like to believe that it's true

3974
01:12:43,910 --> 01:12:43,920
we would like to believe that it's true
 

3975
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:46,310
we would like to believe that it's true
that there is more and more of a

3976
01:12:46,310 --> 01:12:46,320
that there is more and more of a
 

3977
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:48,310
that there is more and more of a
standard formula as i was saying like

3978
01:12:48,310 --> 01:12:48,320
standard formula as i was saying like
 

3979
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:50,390
standard formula as i was saying like
this recipe that works for everything

3980
01:12:50,390 --> 01:12:50,400
this recipe that works for everything
 

3981
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:52,870
this recipe that works for everything
but then when you zoom into this each of

3982
01:12:52,870 --> 01:12:52,880
but then when you zoom into this each of
 

3983
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:55,750
but then when you zoom into this each of
these projects then you realize the the

3984
01:12:55,750 --> 01:12:55,760
these projects then you realize the the
 

3985
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:57,830
these projects then you realize the the
the devil is indeed in the details and

3986
01:12:57,830 --> 01:12:57,840
the devil is indeed in the details and
 

3987
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:59,669
the devil is indeed in the details and
then the teams

3988
01:12:59,669 --> 01:12:59,679
then the teams
 

3989
01:12:59,679 --> 01:13:01,750
then the teams
have to work kind of together towards

3990
01:13:01,750 --> 01:13:01,760
have to work kind of together towards
 

3991
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:05,430
have to work kind of together towards
these goals um so engineering of data

3992
01:13:05,430 --> 01:13:05,440
these goals um so engineering of data
 

3993
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:08,070
these goals um so engineering of data
and obviously clusters and large scale

3994
01:13:08,070 --> 01:13:08,080
and obviously clusters and large scale
 

3995
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:10,149
and obviously clusters and large scale
is very important and then

3996
01:13:10,149 --> 01:13:10,159
is very important and then
 

3997
01:13:10,159 --> 01:13:12,550
is very important and then
one that is often

3998
01:13:12,550 --> 01:13:12,560
one that is often
 

3999
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:15,030
one that is often
not maybe nowadays it is more more clear

4000
01:13:15,030 --> 01:13:15,040
not maybe nowadays it is more more clear
 

4001
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:15,750
not maybe nowadays it is more more clear
is

4002
01:13:15,750 --> 01:13:15,760
is
 

4003
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:17,510
is
benchmark progress right so we're

4004
01:13:17,510 --> 01:13:17,520
benchmark progress right so we're
 

4005
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:20,070
benchmark progress right so we're
talking here about multiple months of

4006
01:13:20,070 --> 01:13:20,080
talking here about multiple months of
 

4007
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:23,510
talking here about multiple months of
you know tens of researchers um and and

4008
01:13:23,510 --> 01:13:23,520
you know tens of researchers um and and
 

4009
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:25,510
you know tens of researchers um and and
and people that are trying to organize

4010
01:13:25,510 --> 01:13:25,520
and people that are trying to organize
 

4011
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:27,990
and people that are trying to organize
the research and so on working together

4012
01:13:27,990 --> 01:13:28,000
the research and so on working together
 

4013
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,830
the research and so on working together
and

4014
01:13:29,830 --> 01:13:29,840
and
 

4015
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:32,070
and
you don't know that you can get there i

4016
01:13:32,070 --> 01:13:32,080
you don't know that you can get there i
 

4017
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:33,910
you don't know that you can get there i
mean it is this this is this is the

4018
01:13:33,910 --> 01:13:33,920
mean it is this this is this is the
 

4019
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:36,229
mean it is this this is this is the
beauty like if you're not risking to

4020
01:13:36,229 --> 01:13:36,239
beauty like if you're not risking to
 

4021
01:13:36,239 --> 01:13:37,669
beauty like if you're not risking to
trying to do something that feels

4022
01:13:37,669 --> 01:13:37,679

impossible you're not gonna get there um

4024
01:13:41,510 --> 01:13:41,520
impossible you're not gonna get there um
 

4025
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:43,830
impossible you're not gonna get there um
but you need the way to measure progress

4026
01:13:43,830 --> 01:13:43,840
but you need the way to measure progress
 

4027
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:45,990
but you need the way to measure progress
so the benchmarks that you build are

4028
01:13:45,990 --> 01:13:46,000
so the benchmarks that you build are
 

4029
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,790
so the benchmarks that you build are
critical um i've seen this beautifully

4030
01:13:48,790 --> 01:13:48,800

4033
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:52,709

which means we we established the metric

4038
01:13:56,790 --> 01:13:56,800
which means we we established the metric
 

4039
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:58,950
which means we we established the metric
actually the community did and then we

on a philosophical or technical level
 

4137
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:44,229
on a philosophical or technical level
introspect what is the magic of

01:15:44,229 --> 01:15:44,239
introspect what is the magic of

01:15:44,239 --> 01:15:45,350
introspect what is the magic of
attention

4140
01:15:45,350 --> 01:15:45,360
attention
 

4141
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:47,189
attention
what is what is the tension

4142
01:15:47,189 --> 01:15:47,199
what is what is the tension
 

4143
01:15:47,199 --> 01:15:49,350
what is what is the tension
that's attention in people that study

4144
01:15:49,350 --> 01:15:49,360
that's attention in people that study
 

4145
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:52,310
that's attention in people that study
cognition so human attention i think

4146
01:15:52,310 --> 01:15:52,320
cognition so human attention i think
 

4147
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:54,709
cognition so human attention i think
there's giant wars over what attention

4148
01:15:54,709 --> 01:15:54,719
there's giant wars over what attention
 

4149
01:15:54,719 --> 01:15:55,669
there's giant wars over what attention
means

4150
01:15:55,669 --> 01:15:55,679
means
 

4151
01:15:55,679 --> 01:15:58,709
means
how it works in the human mind so what

4152
01:15:58,709 --> 01:15:58,719
how it works in the human mind so what
 

4153
01:15:58,719 --> 01:16:00,870
how it works in the human mind so what
this very simple looks at what attention

4154
01:16:00,870 --> 01:16:00,880
this very simple looks at what attention
 

4155
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:02,470
this very simple looks at what attention
is in your network

4156
01:16:02,470 --> 01:16:02,480
is in your network
 

4157
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:04,070
is in your network
from the days of attention is all you

4158
01:16:04,070 --> 01:16:04,080
from the days of attention is all you
 

4159
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:05,830
from the days of attention is all you
need but broad do you think there's a

4160
01:16:05,830 --> 01:16:05,840
need but broad do you think there's a
 

4161
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:07,669
need but broad do you think there's a
general principle that's that's really

4162
01:16:07,669 --> 01:16:07,679
general principle that's that's really
 

4163
01:16:07,679 --> 01:16:10,390
general principle that's that's really
powerful here yeah so a distinction

4164
01:16:10,390 --> 01:16:10,400
powerful here yeah so a distinction
 

4165
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:13,669
powerful here yeah so a distinction
between transformers and lstms which

4166
01:16:13,669 --> 01:16:13,679
between transformers and lstms which
 

4167
01:16:13,679 --> 01:16:16,390
between transformers and lstms which
were what came before and and you know

4168
01:16:16,390 --> 01:16:16,400
were what came before and and you know
 

4169
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:17,990
were what came before and and you know
there was a transitional period where

4170
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:18,000
there was a transitional period where
 

4171
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,470
there was a transitional period where
you could you could use both in fact

4172
01:16:20,470 --> 01:16:20,480
you could you could use both in fact
 

4173
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:22,229
you could you could use both in fact
when we talked about alpha star we used

4174
01:16:22,229 --> 01:16:22,239
when we talked about alpha star we used
 

4175
01:16:22,239 --> 01:16:25,030
when we talked about alpha star we used
transformers and lstms so it was still

4176
01:16:25,030 --> 01:16:25,040
transformers and lstms so it was still
 

4177
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:26,550
transformers and lstms so it was still
the beginning of transformers they were

4178
01:16:26,550 --> 01:16:26,560
the beginning of transformers they were
 

4179
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:29,110
the beginning of transformers they were
very powerful but lstms were still very

4180
01:16:29,110 --> 01:16:29,120
very powerful but lstms were still very
 

4181
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:31,430
very powerful but lstms were still very
also very powerful sequence models

4182
01:16:31,430 --> 01:16:31,440
also very powerful sequence models
 

4183
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:32,550
also very powerful sequence models
so

4184
01:16:32,550 --> 01:16:32,560
so
 

4185
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:35,030
so
the power of the transformer

4186
01:16:35,030 --> 01:16:35,040
the power of the transformer
 

4187
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:37,669
the power of the transformer
is that it has built in

4188
01:16:37,669 --> 01:16:37,679
is that it has built in
 

4189
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:39,830
is that it has built in
what we call an inductive bias of

4190
01:16:39,830 --> 01:16:39,840
what we call an inductive bias of
 

4191
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:41,030
what we call an inductive bias of
attention

4192
01:16:41,030 --> 01:16:41,040
attention
 

4193
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:43,830
attention
that makes the model when when you think

4194
01:16:43,830 --> 01:16:43,840
that makes the model when when you think
 

4195
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:45,830
that makes the model when when you think
of a sequence of integers right like we

4196
01:16:45,830 --> 01:16:45,840
of a sequence of integers right like we
 

4197
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:47,669
of a sequence of integers right like we
discussed this before right this is the

4198
01:16:47,669 --> 01:16:47,679
discussed this before right this is the
 

4199
01:16:47,679 --> 01:16:49,189
discussed this before right this is the
sequence of words

4200
01:16:49,189 --> 01:16:49,199
sequence of words
 

4201
01:16:49,199 --> 01:16:50,310
sequence of words
um

4202
01:16:50,310 --> 01:16:50,320
um
 

4203
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:53,030
um
when you when you have to do very hard

4204
01:16:53,030 --> 01:16:53,040
when you when you have to do very hard
 

4205
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:55,270
when you when you have to do very hard
tasks over these words this could be

4206
01:16:55,270 --> 01:16:55,280
tasks over these words this could be
 

4207
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:57,750
tasks over these words this could be
we're gonna translate a whole paragraph

4208
01:16:57,750 --> 01:16:57,760
we're gonna translate a whole paragraph
 

4209
01:16:57,760 --> 01:16:59,189
we're gonna translate a whole paragraph
or we're gonna predict the next

4210
01:16:59,189 --> 01:16:59,199
or we're gonna predict the next
 

4211
01:16:59,199 --> 01:17:04,149
or we're gonna predict the next
paragraph given ten paragraphs before

4212
01:17:04,149 --> 01:17:04,159

 

4213
01:17:04,159 --> 01:17:05,669

there's some

4214
01:17:05,669 --> 01:17:05,679
there's some
 

4215
01:17:05,679 --> 01:17:07,510
there's some
loose

4216
01:17:07,510 --> 01:17:07,520
loose
 

4217
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:10,149
loose
intuition from how we do it as a human

4218
01:17:10,149 --> 01:17:10,159
intuition from how we do it as a human
 

4219
01:17:10,159 --> 01:17:11,430
intuition from how we do it as a human
that is very

4220
01:17:11,430 --> 01:17:11,440
that is very
 

4221
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:14,709
that is very
nicely mimicked and re like replicated

4222
01:17:14,709 --> 01:17:14,719
nicely mimicked and re like replicated
 

4223
01:17:14,719 --> 01:17:16,390
nicely mimicked and re like replicated
structurally speaking in the transformer

4224
01:17:16,390 --> 01:17:16,400
structurally speaking in the transformer
 

4225
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:18,950
structurally speaking in the transformer
which is this idea of

4226
01:17:18,950 --> 01:17:18,960
which is this idea of
 

4227
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:20,790
which is this idea of
you're looking for something

4228
01:17:20,790 --> 01:17:20,800
you're looking for something
 

4229
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:24,070
you're looking for something
right so you're sort of when you're

4230
01:17:24,070 --> 01:17:24,080
right so you're sort of when you're
 

4231
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:25,750
right so you're sort of when you're
you you just read a piece of text now

4232
01:17:25,750 --> 01:17:25,760
you you just read a piece of text now
 

4233
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:27,750
you you just read a piece of text now
you're thinking what comes next

4234
01:17:27,750 --> 01:17:27,760
you're thinking what comes next
 

4235
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:30,470
you're thinking what comes next
you might want to re-look at the text

4236
01:17:30,470 --> 01:17:30,480
you might want to re-look at the text
 

4237
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:32,470
you might want to re-look at the text
or look it from scratch i mean

4238
01:17:32,470 --> 01:17:32,480
or look it from scratch i mean
 

4239
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:34,070
or look it from scratch i mean
literally is is because there's no

4240
01:17:34,070 --> 01:17:34,080
literally is is because there's no
 

4241
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:35,990
literally is is because there's no
recurrence you're just thinking what

4242
01:17:35,990 --> 01:17:36,000
recurrence you're just thinking what
 

4243
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,070
recurrence you're just thinking what
comes next and

4244
01:17:38,070 --> 01:17:38,080
comes next and
 

4245
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:40,229
comes next and
it's almost hypothesis driven right so

4246
01:17:40,229 --> 01:17:40,239
it's almost hypothesis driven right so
 

4247
01:17:40,239 --> 01:17:42,870
it's almost hypothesis driven right so
if if i'm thinking the next word that

4248
01:17:42,870 --> 01:17:42,880
if if i'm thinking the next word that
 

4249
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:46,470
if if i'm thinking the next word that
i'll write is cat or dog okay um

4250
01:17:46,470 --> 01:17:46,480
i'll write is cat or dog okay um
 

4251
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:48,630
i'll write is cat or dog okay um
the way the transformer works

4252
01:17:48,630 --> 01:17:48,640
the way the transformer works
 

4253
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:51,270
the way the transformer works
almost philosophically is it

4254
01:17:51,270 --> 01:17:51,280
almost philosophically is it
 

4255
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:53,510
almost philosophically is it
has these two hypotheses is it is it

4256
01:17:53,510 --> 01:17:53,520
has these two hypotheses is it is it
 

4257
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:55,750
has these two hypotheses is it is it
gonna be cat or is it gonna be dark and

4258
01:17:55,750 --> 01:17:55,760
gonna be cat or is it gonna be dark and
 

4259
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:56,630
gonna be cat or is it gonna be dark and
then

4260
01:17:56,630 --> 01:17:56,640
then
 

4261
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:58,870
then
it says okay if it's cat i'm gonna look

4262
01:17:58,870 --> 01:17:58,880
it says okay if it's cat i'm gonna look
 

4263
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:00,550
it says okay if it's cat i'm gonna look
for certain words not necessarily cat

4264
01:18:00,550 --> 01:18:00,560
for certain words not necessarily cat
 

4265
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:01,910
for certain words not necessarily cat
although cud is an obvious word you

4266
01:18:01,910 --> 01:18:01,920
although cud is an obvious word you
 

4267
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:03,750
although cud is an obvious word you
would look in the past to see whether it

4268
01:18:03,750 --> 01:18:03,760
would look in the past to see whether it
 

4269
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:05,910
would look in the past to see whether it
makes more sense to output cut or dog

4270
01:18:05,910 --> 01:18:05,920
makes more sense to output cut or dog
 

4271
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:08,310
makes more sense to output cut or dog
and then it does some very

4272
01:18:08,310 --> 01:18:08,320
and then it does some very
 

4273
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:10,709
and then it does some very
deep computation over the words and

4274
01:18:10,709 --> 01:18:10,719
deep computation over the words and
 

4275
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:12,950
deep computation over the words and
beyond right so it combines the words

4276
01:18:12,950 --> 01:18:12,960
beyond right so it combines the words
 

4277
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:14,070
beyond right so it combines the words
and

4278
01:18:14,070 --> 01:18:14,080
and
 

4279
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:15,030
and
but

4280
01:18:15,030 --> 01:18:15,040
but
 

4281
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:17,189
but
but it has the query as we call it that

4282
01:18:17,189 --> 01:18:17,199
but it has the query as we call it that
 

4283
01:18:17,199 --> 01:18:18,390
but it has the query as we call it that
is cat

4284
01:18:18,390 --> 01:18:18,400
is cat
 

4285
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:20,790
is cat
and then similarly for doc right and so

4286
01:18:20,790 --> 01:18:20,800
and then similarly for doc right and so
 

4287
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:22,630
and then similarly for doc right and so
it's it's very it's a very computational

4288
01:18:22,630 --> 01:18:22,640
it's it's very it's a very computational
 

4289
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:24,310
it's it's very it's a very computational
way to think about

4290
01:18:24,310 --> 01:18:24,320
way to think about
 

4291
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:26,390
way to think about
look if i'm if i'm thinking deeply about

4292
01:18:26,390 --> 01:18:26,400
look if i'm if i'm thinking deeply about
 

4293
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:28,870
look if i'm if i'm thinking deeply about
text i need to go back to to look at all

4294
01:18:28,870 --> 01:18:28,880
text i need to go back to to look at all
 

4295
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:30,950
text i need to go back to to look at all
the texts attend over it but it's not

4296
01:18:30,950 --> 01:18:30,960
the texts attend over it but it's not
 

4297
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:33,189
the texts attend over it but it's not
just attention like what what is guiding

4298
01:18:33,189 --> 01:18:33,199
just attention like what what is guiding
 

4299
01:18:33,199 --> 01:18:34,630
just attention like what what is guiding
the attention and that was the key

4300
01:18:34,630 --> 01:18:34,640
the attention and that was the key
 

4301
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:37,910
the attention and that was the key
insight from an earlier paper is not

4302
01:18:37,910 --> 01:18:37,920
insight from an earlier paper is not
 

4303
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:39,830
insight from an earlier paper is not
how far away is it i mean how far away

4304
01:18:39,830 --> 01:18:39,840
how far away is it i mean how far away
 

4305
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:41,830
how far away is it i mean how far away
is it is important what what what did i

4306
01:18:41,830 --> 01:18:41,840
is it is important what what what did i
 

4307
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:44,149
is it is important what what what did i
just write about that's critical but

4308
01:18:44,149 --> 01:18:44,159
just write about that's critical but
 

4309
01:18:44,159 --> 01:18:45,590
just write about that's critical but
what you wrote about

4310
01:18:45,590 --> 01:18:45,600
what you wrote about
 

4311
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:48,310
what you wrote about
10 pages ago might also be critical

4312
01:18:48,310 --> 01:18:48,320
10 pages ago might also be critical
 

4313
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:49,030
10 pages ago might also be critical
so

4314
01:18:49,030 --> 01:18:49,040
so
 

4315
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:51,750
so
you're looking not positionally but

4316
01:18:51,750 --> 01:18:51,760
you're looking not positionally but
 

4317
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:54,870
you're looking not positionally but
content-wise right and you transformers

4318
01:18:54,870 --> 01:18:54,880
content-wise right and you transformers
 

4319
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:56,870
content-wise right and you transformers
have this beautiful way to query for

4320
01:18:56,870 --> 01:18:56,880
have this beautiful way to query for
 

4321
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:59,510
have this beautiful way to query for
certain content and pull it out com in a

4322
01:18:59,510 --> 01:18:59,520
certain content and pull it out com in a
 

4323
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:01,430
certain content and pull it out com in a
compressed way so then you can make a

4324
01:19:01,430 --> 01:19:01,440
compressed way so then you can make a
 

4325
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:03,750
compressed way so then you can make a
more informed decision i mean that's one

4326
01:19:03,750 --> 01:19:03,760
more informed decision i mean that's one
 

4327
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:06,149
more informed decision i mean that's one
way to explain transformers um but i

4328
01:19:06,149 --> 01:19:06,159
way to explain transformers um but i
 

4329
01:19:06,159 --> 01:19:07,910
way to explain transformers um but i
think it's it's very it's a very

4330
01:19:07,910 --> 01:19:07,920
think it's it's very it's a very
 

4331
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:09,910
think it's it's very it's a very
powerful inductive bias

4332
01:19:09,910 --> 01:19:09,920
powerful inductive bias
 

4333
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:11,270
powerful inductive bias
there might be some details that might

4334
01:19:11,270 --> 01:19:11,280
there might be some details that might
 

4335
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:13,350
there might be some details that might
change over time but

4336
01:19:13,350 --> 01:19:13,360
change over time but
 

4337
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:15,030
change over time but
i think that is

4338
01:19:15,030 --> 01:19:15,040
i think that is
 

4339
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:17,270
i think that is
what makes transformers so much more

4340
01:19:17,270 --> 01:19:17,280
what makes transformers so much more
 

4341
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:19,830
what makes transformers so much more
powerful than the recurrent networks

4342
01:19:19,830 --> 01:19:19,840
powerful than the recurrent networks
 

4343
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:22,310
powerful than the recurrent networks
that were more recently biased based

4344
01:19:22,310 --> 01:19:22,320

what i think goes well beyond the

4380
01:19:59,669 --> 01:19:59,679
what i think goes well beyond the
 

4381
01:19:59,679 --> 01:20:02,229
what i think goes well beyond the
current capabilities um so the question

4382
01:20:02,229 --> 01:20:02,239
current capabilities um so the question
 

4383
01:20:02,239 --> 01:20:04,390
current capabilities um so the question
is how do we benchmark this and

4384
01:20:04,390 --> 01:20:04,400
is how do we benchmark this and
 

4385
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:06,390
is how do we benchmark this and
then how do we change the structure of

4386
01:20:06,390 --> 01:20:06,400
then how do we change the structure of
 

4387
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:08,070
then how do we change the structure of
the architectures i think there's ideas

4388
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:08,080
the architectures i think there's ideas
 

4389
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:09,430
the architectures i think there's ideas
on both sides but

4390
01:20:09,430 --> 01:20:09,440
on both sides but
 

4391
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:11,189
on both sides but
we'll have to see empirically right

4392
01:20:11,189 --> 01:20:11,199
we'll have to see empirically right
 

4393
01:20:11,199 --> 01:20:13,270
we'll have to see empirically right
obviously what ends up working

4394
01:20:13,270 --> 01:20:13,280
obviously what ends up working
 

4395
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:14,870
obviously what ends up working
and as as you talked about some of the

4396
01:20:14,870 --> 01:20:14,880
and as as you talked about some of the
 

4397
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:16,830
and as as you talked about some of the
ideas could be you know keeping the

4398
01:20:16,830 --> 01:20:16,840
ideas could be you know keeping the
 

4399
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:19,510
ideas could be you know keeping the
constraint of that length in place but

4400
01:20:19,510 --> 01:20:19,520
constraint of that length in place but
 

4401
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:21,430
constraint of that length in place but
then forming like hierarchical

4402
01:20:21,430 --> 01:20:21,440
then forming like hierarchical
 

4403
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:22,950
then forming like hierarchical
representations

4404
01:20:22,950 --> 01:20:22,960
representations
 

4405
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:26,149
representations
to where you can start being much clever

4406
01:20:26,149 --> 01:20:26,159
to where you can start being much clever
 

4407
01:20:26,159 --> 01:20:31,110
to where you can start being much clever
in how you use those thousand tokens

4408
01:20:31,110 --> 01:20:31,120

 

4409
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:32,390

yeah that's really interesting but it

4410
01:20:32,390 --> 01:20:32,400
yeah that's really interesting but it
 

4411
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:34,149
yeah that's really interesting but it
also is possible that this attention

4412
01:20:34,149 --> 01:20:34,159
also is possible that this attention
 

4413
01:20:34,159 --> 01:20:36,390
also is possible that this attention
mechanism where you basically you don't

4414
01:20:36,390 --> 01:20:36,400
mechanism where you basically you don't
 

4415
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:38,870
mechanism where you basically you don't
have a recency bias but you you you look

4416
01:20:38,870 --> 01:20:38,880
have a recency bias but you you you look
 

4417
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:41,830
have a recency bias but you you you look
more generally you you make it learnable

4418
01:20:41,830 --> 01:20:41,840
more generally you you make it learnable
 

4419
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:43,910
more generally you you make it learnable
the mechanism in which way you look back

4420
01:20:43,910 --> 01:20:43,920
the mechanism in which way you look back
 

4421
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:46,629
the mechanism in which way you look back
into the past you make that learnable

4422
01:20:46,629 --> 01:20:46,639
into the past you make that learnable
 

4423
01:20:46,639 --> 01:20:48,310
into the past you make that learnable
it's also possible where at the very

4424
01:20:48,310 --> 01:20:48,320
it's also possible where at the very
 

4425
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:50,070
it's also possible where at the very
beginning of that

4426
01:20:50,070 --> 01:20:50,080
beginning of that
 

4427
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:51,590
beginning of that
because

4428
01:20:51,590 --> 01:20:51,600
because
 

4429
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:52,390
because
that

4430
01:20:52,390 --> 01:20:52,400
that
 

4431
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:54,390
that
you might become smarter and smarter in

4432
01:20:54,390 --> 01:20:54,400
you might become smarter and smarter in
 

4433
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:55,350
you might become smarter and smarter in
the way

4434
01:20:55,350 --> 01:20:55,360
the way
 

4435
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:58,310
the way
you query the past

4436
01:20:58,310 --> 01:20:58,320
you query the past
 

4437
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:00,550
you query the past
so recent past and distant past and

4438
01:21:00,550 --> 01:21:00,560
so recent past and distant past and
 

4439
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:02,870
so recent past and distant past and
maybe very very distant path so almost

4440
01:21:02,870 --> 01:21:02,880
maybe very very distant path so almost
 

4441
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:04,870
maybe very very distant path so almost
like the attention mechanism

4442
01:21:04,870 --> 01:21:04,880
like the attention mechanism
 

4443
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:06,070
like the attention mechanism
will have to

4444
01:21:06,070 --> 01:21:06,080
will have to
 

4445
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:09,030
will have to
improve and evolve as good as the

4446
01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:09,040
improve and evolve as good as the
 

4447
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:10,310
improve and evolve as good as the
uh the

4448
01:21:10,310 --> 01:21:10,320
uh the
 

4449
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:12,629
uh the
tokenization mechanism where so you can

4450
01:21:12,629 --> 01:21:12,639
tokenization mechanism where so you can
 

4451
01:21:12,639 --> 01:21:15,990
tokenization mechanism where so you can
represent long-term memory somehow yes

4452
01:21:15,990 --> 01:21:16,000
represent long-term memory somehow yes
 

4453
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,149
represent long-term memory somehow yes
and i mean hierarchies are are very i

4454
01:21:18,149 --> 01:21:18,159
and i mean hierarchies are are very i
 

4455
01:21:18,159 --> 01:21:20,709
and i mean hierarchies are are very i
mean it's a very nice word that sounds

4456
01:21:20,709 --> 01:21:20,719
mean it's a very nice word that sounds
 

4457
01:21:20,719 --> 01:21:23,350
mean it's a very nice word that sounds
appealing um there's lots of work adding

4458
01:21:23,350 --> 01:21:23,360
appealing um there's lots of work adding
 

4459
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:27,110
appealing um there's lots of work adding
hierarchy to the memories um in practice

4460
01:21:27,110 --> 01:21:27,120
hierarchy to the memories um in practice
 

4461
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:29,510
hierarchy to the memories um in practice
it does seem like we keep coming back to

4462
01:21:29,510 --> 01:21:29,520
it does seem like we keep coming back to
 

4463
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:31,990
it does seem like we keep coming back to
the main formula or main

4467
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:35,430
architecture
that sometimes tells us something

4468
01:21:35,430 --> 01:21:35,440
that sometimes tells us something
 

4469
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:37,910
that sometimes tells us something
there's such a sentence that a friend of

4470
01:21:37,910 --> 01:21:37,920
there's such a sentence that a friend of
 

4471
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:39,990
there's such a sentence that a friend of
mine told me like whether it wants to

01:21:39,990 --> 01:21:40,000
mine told me like whether it wants to
 

4473
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:43,110
mine told me like whether it wants to
work or not so transformer was clearly

4474
01:21:43,110 --> 01:21:43,120
work or not so transformer was clearly
 

4475
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:45,990
work or not so transformer was clearly
an idea that wanted to work and then

4476
01:21:45,990 --> 01:21:46,000
an idea that wanted to work and then
 

4477
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,590
an idea that wanted to work and then
i think there's some principles we

4478
01:21:47,590 --> 01:21:47,600
i think there's some principles we
 

4479
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:50,070
i think there's some principles we
believe will be needed but finding the

4480
01:21:50,070 --> 01:21:50,080
believe will be needed but finding the
 

4481
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:52,229
believe will be needed but finding the
exact details details matter so much

4482
01:21:52,229 --> 01:21:52,239
exact details details matter so much
 

4483
01:21:52,239 --> 01:21:54,550
exact details details matter so much
right that's gonna be tricky i love the

4484
01:21:54,550 --> 01:21:54,560
right that's gonna be tricky i love the
 

4485
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:56,870
right that's gonna be tricky i love the
idea that there's like

4486
01:21:56,870 --> 01:21:56,880
idea that there's like
 

4487
01:21:56,880 --> 01:21:58,070
idea that there's like
you as a

4488
01:21:58,070 --> 01:21:58,080
you as a
 

4489
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:00,709
you as a
human being you want you want some ideas

4490
01:22:00,709 --> 01:22:00,719
human being you want you want some ideas
 

4491
01:22:00,719 --> 01:22:02,870
human being you want you want some ideas
to work and then there's the model that

4492
01:22:02,870 --> 01:22:02,880
to work and then there's the model that
 

4493
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:04,950
to work and then there's the model that
wants some ideas to work and you get to

4494
01:22:04,950 --> 01:22:04,960
wants some ideas to work and you get to
 

4495
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:07,270
wants some ideas to work and you get to
have a conversation to see which

4496
01:22:07,270 --> 01:22:07,280
have a conversation to see which
 

4497
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:09,110
have a conversation to see which
more likely the model will win in the

more likely the model will win in the

because it's the one you don't have to
 

4503

because it's the one you don't have to
do any work the model is the one that

do any work the model is the one that
has to do the work so you should listen

4506
01:22:14,870 --> 01:22:14,880
has to do the work so you should listen
 

4507
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:17,110
has to do the work so you should listen
to the model and i really love this idea

4508
01:22:17,110 --> 01:22:17,120
to the model and i really love this idea
 

4509
01:22:17,120 --> 01:22:18,470
to the model and i really love this idea
that you talked about the humans in this

4510
01:22:18,470 --> 01:22:18,480
that you talked about the humans in this
 

4511
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:21,110
that you talked about the humans in this
picture if i could just briefly ask um

4512
01:22:21,110 --> 01:22:21,120
picture if i could just briefly ask um
 

4513
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:22,790
picture if i could just briefly ask um
one is you're saying

4514
01:22:22,790 --> 01:22:22,800
one is you're saying
 

4515
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:25,110
one is you're saying
the benchmarks

4516
01:22:25,110 --> 01:22:25,120
the benchmarks
 

4517
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:28,550
the benchmarks
about the modular humans working on this

4518
01:22:28,550 --> 01:22:28,560
about the modular humans working on this
 

4519
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:31,110
about the modular humans working on this
uh the benchmarks providing a sturdy

4520
01:22:31,110 --> 01:22:31,120
uh the benchmarks providing a sturdy
 

4521
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:33,110
uh the benchmarks providing a sturdy
ground of a wish to do these things that

4522
01:22:33,110 --> 01:22:33,120
ground of a wish to do these things that
 

4523
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:34,629
ground of a wish to do these things that
seem impossible

4524
01:22:34,629 --> 01:22:34,639
seem impossible
 

4525
01:22:34,639 --> 01:22:36,550
seem impossible
they they give you

4526
01:22:36,550 --> 01:22:36,560
they they give you
 

4527
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:38,950
they they give you
in the darkest of times give you hope

4528
01:22:38,950 --> 01:22:38,960
in the darkest of times give you hope
 

4529
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:40,790
in the darkest of times give you hope
because little signs of improvement you

4530
01:22:40,790 --> 01:22:40,800
because little signs of improvement you
 

4531
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:43,990
because little signs of improvement you
get you could yes like you're not you're

4532
01:22:43,990 --> 01:22:44,000
get you could yes like you're not you're
 

4533
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,910
get you could yes like you're not you're
somehow you're not lost if you have

4534
01:22:45,910 --> 01:22:45,920
somehow you're not lost if you have
 

4535
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:48,629
somehow you're not lost if you have
metrics to measure your your improvement

4536
01:22:48,629 --> 01:22:48,639
metrics to measure your your improvement
 

4537
01:22:48,639 --> 01:22:50,629
metrics to measure your your improvement
and then there's other aspect

4538
01:22:50,629 --> 01:22:50,639
and then there's other aspect
 

4539
01:22:50,639 --> 01:22:54,470
and then there's other aspect
you said elsewhere and here today like

4540
01:22:54,470 --> 01:22:54,480
you said elsewhere and here today like
 

4541
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:56,470
you said elsewhere and here today like
titles matter

4542
01:22:56,470 --> 01:22:56,480
titles matter
 

4543
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:59,110
titles matter
i wonder

4544
01:22:59,110 --> 01:22:59,120

 

4545
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:01,110

how much humans matter in the evolution

4546
01:23:01,110 --> 01:23:01,120
how much humans matter in the evolution
 

4547
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:02,310
how much humans matter in the evolution
of all this

4548
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:02,320
of all this
 

4549
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:06,229
of all this
meaning individual humans

4550
01:23:06,229 --> 01:23:06,239
meaning individual humans
 

4551
01:23:06,239 --> 01:23:07,430
meaning individual humans
you know something about their

4552
01:23:07,430 --> 01:23:07,440
you know something about their
 

4553
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:09,030
you know something about their
interaction something about their ideas

4554
01:23:09,030 --> 01:23:09,040
interaction something about their ideas
 

4555
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:10,709
interaction something about their ideas
how much they

4556
01:23:10,709 --> 01:23:10,719
how much they
 

4557
01:23:10,719 --> 01:23:13,189
how much they
change the direction of all this like if

4558
01:23:13,189 --> 01:23:13,199
change the direction of all this like if
 

4559
01:23:13,199 --> 01:23:15,030
change the direction of all this like if
you change the humans in this picture

4560
01:23:15,030 --> 01:23:15,040
you change the humans in this picture
 

4561
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:17,110
you change the humans in this picture
like is is it that the model is sitting

4562
01:23:17,110 --> 01:23:17,120
like is is it that the model is sitting
 

4563
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:18,070
like is is it that the model is sitting
there

4564
01:23:18,070 --> 01:23:18,080
there
 

4565
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:21,590
there
and it wants you it wants some idea to

4566
01:23:21,590 --> 01:23:21,600
and it wants you it wants some idea to
 

4567
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:24,550
and it wants you it wants some idea to
work or is it the humans or maybe the

4568
01:23:24,550 --> 01:23:24,560
work or is it the humans or maybe the
 

4569
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:26,229
work or is it the humans or maybe the
model is providing you 20 ideas that

4570
01:23:26,229 --> 01:23:26,239
model is providing you 20 ideas that
 

4571
01:23:26,239 --> 01:23:28,070
model is providing you 20 ideas that
could work and depending on the humans

4572
01:23:28,070 --> 01:23:28,080
could work and depending on the humans
 

4573
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:29,910
could work and depending on the humans
you pick they're they're going to be

4574
01:23:29,910 --> 01:23:29,920
you pick they're they're going to be
 

4575
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:31,910
you pick they're they're going to be
able to hear some of those ideas like in

4576
01:23:31,910 --> 01:23:31,920
able to hear some of those ideas like in
 

4577
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:34,550
able to hear some of those ideas like in
in all the because you're now directing

4578
01:23:34,550 --> 01:23:34,560
in all the because you're now directing
 

4579
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:35,990
in all the because you're now directing
all of deep learning at deepmind you get

4580
01:23:35,990 --> 01:23:36,000
all of deep learning at deepmind you get
 

4581
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:37,510
all of deep learning at deepmind you get
to interact with a lot of projects a lot

4582
01:23:37,510 --> 01:23:37,520
to interact with a lot of projects a lot
 

4583
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:39,430
to interact with a lot of projects a lot
of brilliant researchers

4584
01:23:39,430 --> 01:23:39,440
of brilliant researchers
 

4585
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:40,550
of brilliant researchers
um

4586
01:23:40,550 --> 01:23:40,560
um
 

4587
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:42,550
um
how much variability is created by the

4588
01:23:42,550 --> 01:23:42,560
how much variability is created by the
 

4589
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:45,350
how much variability is created by the
humans in all of this yeah i mean you i

4590
01:23:45,350 --> 01:23:45,360
humans in all of this yeah i mean you i
 

4591
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:47,590
humans in all of this yeah i mean you i
do believe humans matter a lot at the

4592
01:23:47,590 --> 01:23:47,600
do believe humans matter a lot at the
 

4593
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:50,229
do believe humans matter a lot at the
very least at the

4594
01:23:50,229 --> 01:23:50,239
very least at the
 

4595
01:23:50,239 --> 01:23:53,350
very least at the
you know time scale of years

4596
01:23:53,350 --> 01:23:53,360
you know time scale of years
 

4597
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:55,189
you know time scale of years
on when things are happening and what's

4598
01:23:55,189 --> 01:23:55,199
on when things are happening and what's
 

4599
01:23:55,199 --> 01:23:58,070
on when things are happening and what's
the sequencing of it right so you get to

4600
01:23:58,070 --> 01:23:58,080
the sequencing of it right so you get to
 

4601
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:59,350
the sequencing of it right so you get to
interact with

4602
01:23:59,350 --> 01:23:59,360
interact with
 

4603
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:02,149
interact with
people that i mean you mentioned this um

4604
01:24:02,149 --> 01:24:02,159
people that i mean you mentioned this um
 

4605
01:24:02,159 --> 01:24:03,590
people that i mean you mentioned this um
some people really

4606
01:24:03,590 --> 01:24:03,600
some people really
 

4607
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:05,590
some people really
want some idea to work and they'll

4608
01:24:05,590 --> 01:24:05,600
want some idea to work and they'll
 

4609
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:07,990
want some idea to work and they'll
persist um and then some other people

4610
01:24:07,990 --> 01:24:08,000
persist um and then some other people
 

4611
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,910
persist um and then some other people
might be more practical like i don't

4612
01:24:09,910 --> 01:24:09,920
might be more practical like i don't
 

4613
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:11,430
might be more practical like i don't
care

4614
01:24:11,430 --> 01:24:11,440
care
 

4615
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:14,229
care
what idea works i care about you know

4616
01:24:14,229 --> 01:24:14,239
what idea works i care about you know
 

4617
01:24:14,239 --> 01:24:17,590
what idea works i care about you know
cracking protein folding yes um and

4618
01:24:17,590 --> 01:24:17,600
cracking protein folding yes um and
 

4619
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:19,830
cracking protein folding yes um and
these at least these two kind of seem

4620
01:24:19,830 --> 01:24:19,840
these at least these two kind of seem
 

4621
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:22,950
these at least these two kind of seem
opposite sides we need both and we've

4622
01:24:22,950 --> 01:24:22,960
opposite sides we need both and we've
 

4623
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:24,470
opposite sides we need both and we've
clearly had both

4624
01:24:24,470 --> 01:24:24,480
clearly had both
 

4625
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:26,790
clearly had both
um historically and that made certain

4626
01:24:26,790 --> 01:24:26,800
um historically and that made certain
 

4627
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:30,070
um historically and that made certain
things happen earlier or later so

4628
01:24:30,070 --> 01:24:30,080
things happen earlier or later so
 

4629
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:32,149
things happen earlier or later so
definitely humans involved in all of

4630
01:24:32,149 --> 01:24:32,159
definitely humans involved in all of
 

4631
01:24:32,159 --> 01:24:35,030
definitely humans involved in all of
this endeavor have had

4632
01:24:35,030 --> 01:24:35,040
this endeavor have had
 

4633
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:37,990
this endeavor have had
i would say years of change or of

4634
01:24:37,990 --> 01:24:38,000
i would say years of change or of
 

4635
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,390
i would say years of change or of
ordering how how things have happened

4636
01:24:40,390 --> 01:24:40,400
ordering how how things have happened
 

4637
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:41,910
ordering how how things have happened
which breakthroughs came before which

4638
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:41,920
which breakthroughs came before which
 

4639
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:43,430
which breakthroughs came before which
other breakthroughs and so on so

4640
01:24:43,430 --> 01:24:43,440
other breakthroughs and so on so
 

4641
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:45,669
other breakthroughs and so on so
certainly that does happen

4642
01:24:45,669 --> 01:24:45,679
certainly that does happen
 

4643
01:24:45,679 --> 01:24:47,030
certainly that does happen
and so

4644
01:24:47,030 --> 01:24:47,040
and so
 

4645
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:49,830
and so
one other maybe one other axis of

4646
01:24:49,830 --> 01:24:49,840
one other maybe one other axis of
 

4647
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:51,189
one other maybe one other axis of
distinction is

4648
01:24:51,189 --> 01:24:51,199
distinction is
 

4649
01:24:51,199 --> 01:24:53,510
distinction is
what i called and this is most commonly

4650
01:24:53,510 --> 01:24:53,520
what i called and this is most commonly
 

4651
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:55,110
what i called and this is most commonly
used in reinforcement learning is the

4652
01:24:55,110 --> 01:24:55,120
used in reinforcement learning is the
 

4653
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:57,430
used in reinforcement learning is the
exploration exploitation trade-off as

4654
01:24:57,430 --> 01:24:57,440
exploration exploitation trade-off as
 

4655
01:24:57,440 --> 01:24:58,950
exploration exploitation trade-off as
well it's not exactly what i meant

4656
01:24:58,950 --> 01:24:58,960
well it's not exactly what i meant
 

4657
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:02,310
well it's not exactly what i meant
although quite related so

4658
01:25:02,310 --> 01:25:02,320
although quite related so
 

4659
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:03,510
although quite related so
when you

4660
01:25:03,510 --> 01:25:03,520
when you
 

4661
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:04,950
when you
start

start
 

4663
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:07,430
start
trying to help others right like you

4664
01:25:07,430 --> 01:25:07,440
trying to help others right like you
 

4665

01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:12,070
you're you're you know you're you become
a bit more of a mentor to a large group

4668
01:25:12,070 --> 01:25:12,080
a bit more of a mentor to a large group
 

4669
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:14,470
a bit more of a mentor to a large group
of people beat a project or the deep

4670
01:25:14,470 --> 01:25:14,480
of people beat a project or the deep
 

4671
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:16,709
of people beat a project or the deep
learning team or something um or even in

4672
01:25:16,709 --> 01:25:16,719
learning team or something um or even in
 

4673
01:25:16,719 --> 01:25:18,070
learning team or something um or even in
the community when you interact with

4674
01:25:18,070 --> 01:25:18,080
the community when you interact with
 

4675
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:20,310
the community when you interact with
people in conferences and so on

4676
01:25:20,310 --> 01:25:20,320
people in conferences and so on
 

4677
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:22,550
people in conferences and so on
um you're identifying

4678
01:25:22,550 --> 01:25:22,560
um you're identifying
 

4679
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:24,950
um you're identifying
quickly right um some some things that

4680
01:25:24,950 --> 01:25:24,960
quickly right um some some things that
 

4681
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:27,669
quickly right um some some things that
are explorative or exploitative and

4682
01:25:27,669 --> 01:25:27,679
are explorative or exploitative and
 

4683
01:25:27,679 --> 01:25:30,149
are explorative or exploitative and
it's tempting to try to guide people

4684
01:25:30,149 --> 01:25:30,159
it's tempting to try to guide people
 

4685
01:25:30,159 --> 01:25:32,310
it's tempting to try to guide people
obviously i mean that's what makes like

4686
01:25:32,310 --> 01:25:32,320
obviously i mean that's what makes like
 

4687
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:34,470
obviously i mean that's what makes like
our experience we bring it and we try to

4688
01:25:34,470 --> 01:25:34,480
our experience we bring it and we try to
 

4689
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:37,110
our experience we bring it and we try to
shape things um sometimes wrongly and

4690
01:25:37,110 --> 01:25:37,120
shape things um sometimes wrongly and
 

4691
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:38,870
shape things um sometimes wrongly and
there's many times that i've been wrong

4692
01:25:38,870 --> 01:25:38,880
there's many times that i've been wrong
 

4693
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:40,790
there's many times that i've been wrong
in the past that's great

4694
01:25:40,790 --> 01:25:40,800
in the past that's great
 

4695
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:42,070
in the past that's great
but

4696
01:25:42,070 --> 01:25:42,080
but
 

4697
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:44,470
but
it would be wrong to

4698
01:25:44,470 --> 01:25:44,480
it would be wrong to
 

4699
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:46,709
it would be wrong to
dismiss any sort of

4700
01:25:46,709 --> 01:25:46,719
dismiss any sort of
 

4701
01:25:46,719 --> 01:25:48,550
dismiss any sort of
of the research styles that i'm

4702
01:25:48,550 --> 01:25:48,560
of the research styles that i'm
 

4703
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:51,510
of the research styles that i'm
observing um and i often get asked well

4704
01:25:51,510 --> 01:25:51,520
observing um and i often get asked well
 

4705
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:53,350
observing um and i often get asked well
you're in industry right so we do have

4706
01:25:53,350 --> 01:25:53,360
you're in industry right so we do have
 

4707
01:25:53,360 --> 01:25:55,510
you're in industry right so we do have
access to large compute scale and so on

4708
01:25:55,510 --> 01:25:55,520
access to large compute scale and so on
 

4709
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:57,510
access to large compute scale and so on
so there's certain kinds of research i

4710
01:25:57,510 --> 01:25:57,520
so there's certain kinds of research i
 

4711
01:25:57,520 --> 01:25:59,990
so there's certain kinds of research i
almost feel like we need to do

4712
01:25:59,990 --> 01:26:00,000
almost feel like we need to do
 

4713
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,629
almost feel like we need to do
responsibly and so on but it is kind of

4714
01:26:02,629 --> 01:26:02,639
responsibly and so on but it is kind of
 

4715
01:26:02,639 --> 01:26:05,270
responsibly and so on but it is kind of
we have the particle accelerator here so

4716
01:26:05,270 --> 01:26:05,280
we have the particle accelerator here so
 

4717
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:07,350
we have the particle accelerator here so
to speak in physics so we need to use it

4718
01:26:07,350 --> 01:26:07,360
to speak in physics so we need to use it
 

4719
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:09,110
to speak in physics so we need to use it
we need to answer the questions that we

4720
01:26:09,110 --> 01:26:09,120
we need to answer the questions that we
 

4721
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:10,709
we need to answer the questions that we
should be answering right now for the

4722
01:26:10,709 --> 01:26:10,719
should be answering right now for the
 

4723
01:26:10,719 --> 01:26:13,110
should be answering right now for the
scientific progress but then at the same

4724
01:26:13,110 --> 01:26:13,120
scientific progress but then at the same
 

4725
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:15,750
scientific progress but then at the same
time i look at many advances including

4726
01:26:15,750 --> 01:26:15,760
time i look at many advances including
 

4727
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:18,310
time i look at many advances including
attention which was discovered

4728
01:26:18,310 --> 01:26:18,320
attention which was discovered
 

4729
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:21,510
attention which was discovered
in montreal initially because of lack of

4730
01:26:21,510 --> 01:26:21,520
in montreal initially because of lack of
 

4731
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:23,189
in montreal initially because of lack of
compute right so we were working on

4732
01:26:23,189 --> 01:26:23,199
compute right so we were working on
 

4733
01:26:23,199 --> 01:26:25,590
compute right so we were working on
sequence to sequence um with with my

4734
01:26:25,590 --> 01:26:25,600
sequence to sequence um with with my
 

4735
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:27,830
sequence to sequence um with with my
friends over at google brain at the time

4736
01:26:27,830 --> 01:26:27,840
friends over at google brain at the time
 

4737
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:30,310
friends over at google brain at the time
and we were using i think eight gpus

4738
01:26:30,310 --> 01:26:30,320
and we were using i think eight gpus
 

4739
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:32,470
and we were using i think eight gpus
which was somehow a lot at the time and

4740
01:26:32,470 --> 01:26:32,480
which was somehow a lot at the time and
 

4741
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:34,709
which was somehow a lot at the time and
then i think montreal was a bit more

4742
01:26:34,709 --> 01:26:34,719
then i think montreal was a bit more
 

4743
01:26:34,719 --> 01:26:36,629
then i think montreal was a bit more
limited in the scale but then they

4744
01:26:36,629 --> 01:26:36,639
limited in the scale but then they
 

4745
01:26:36,639 --> 01:26:38,709
limited in the scale but then they
discovered this content-based attention

4746
01:26:38,709 --> 01:26:38,719
discovered this content-based attention
 

4747
01:26:38,719 --> 01:26:41,030
discovered this content-based attention
concept that then has obviously

4748
01:26:41,030 --> 01:26:41,040
concept that then has obviously
 

4749
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:43,590
concept that then has obviously
triggered things like transformer not

4750
01:26:43,590 --> 01:26:43,600
triggered things like transformer not
 

4751
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:45,910
triggered things like transformer not
everything obviously starts transformer

4752
01:26:45,910 --> 01:26:45,920
everything obviously starts transformer
 

4753
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:48,149
everything obviously starts transformer
there's there's always a history that is

4754
01:26:48,149 --> 01:26:48,159
there's there's always a history that is
 

4755
01:26:48,159 --> 01:26:50,709
there's there's always a history that is
is important to recognize because then

4756
01:26:50,709 --> 01:26:50,719
is important to recognize because then
 

4757
01:26:50,719 --> 01:26:53,110
is important to recognize because then
you can make sure that then those who

you can make sure that then those who
 

4759
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:54,870
you can make sure that then those who
might feel now well we don't have so

4760
01:26:54,870 --> 01:26:54,880
might feel now well we don't have so
 

4761
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:56,229
might feel now well we don't have so
much compute

4762
01:26:56,229 --> 01:26:56,239
much compute
 

4763
01:26:56,239 --> 01:26:57,669

you need to then
 

4765
01:26:57,679 --> 01:26:59,110
you need to then
help them

4766
01:26:59,110 --> 01:26:59,120
help them
 

4767
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:00,229
help them
optimize

advancements or perhaps it's a different
 

4779
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:11,750
advancements or perhaps it's a different
time scale but um the people and the

4780
01:27:11,750 --> 01:27:11,760
time scale but um the people and the
 

4781
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:13,750
time scale but um the people and the
diversity of the field is quite critical

4782
01:27:13,750 --> 01:27:13,760
diversity of the field is quite critical
 

4783
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:16,550
diversity of the field is quite critical
to that we maintain it and at times

01:27:16,550 --> 01:27:16,560
to that we maintain it and at times
 

4785
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:19,110
to that we maintain it and at times
especially mixed a bit with hype or

01:27:19,110 --> 01:27:19,120
especially mixed a bit with hype or
 

4787
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:21,510
especially mixed a bit with hype or
other things it's it's a bit tricky to

4788
01:27:21,510 --> 01:27:21,520
other things it's it's a bit tricky to
 

4789
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:24,629
other things it's it's a bit tricky to
be observing um maybe too much of the

4790
01:27:24,629 --> 01:27:24,639
be observing um maybe too much of the
 

4791
01:27:24,639 --> 01:27:28,149
be observing um maybe too much of the
same thinking across the board um but

4792
01:27:28,149 --> 01:27:28,159
same thinking across the board um but
 

4793
01:27:28,159 --> 01:27:31,110
same thinking across the board um but
the humans definitely are critical and i

4794
01:27:31,110 --> 01:27:31,120
the humans definitely are critical and i
 

4795
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:33,350
the humans definitely are critical and i
can think of yeah quite a few personal

4796
01:27:33,350 --> 01:27:33,360
can think of yeah quite a few personal
 

4797
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:35,350
can think of yeah quite a few personal
examples where also

4798
01:27:35,350 --> 01:27:35,360
examples where also
 

4799
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:37,110
examples where also
someone told me something that had a

4800
01:27:37,110 --> 01:27:37,120
someone told me something that had a
 

4801
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:39,750
someone told me something that had a
huge you know huge effect on on to some

4802
01:27:39,750 --> 01:27:39,760
huge you know huge effect on on to some
 

4803
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:41,430
huge you know huge effect on on to some
idea and then that's why i'm saying at

4804
01:27:41,430 --> 01:27:41,440
idea and then that's why i'm saying at
 

4805
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:43,189
idea and then that's why i'm saying at
least at the temp in terms of years

4806
01:27:43,189 --> 01:27:43,199
least at the temp in terms of years
 

4807
01:27:43,199 --> 01:27:45,990
least at the temp in terms of years
probably some things do happen yeah and

4808
01:27:45,990 --> 01:27:46,000
probably some things do happen yeah and
 

4809
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,590
probably some things do happen yeah and
it's also fascinating how constraints

4810
01:27:47,590 --> 01:27:47,600
it's also fascinating how constraints
 

4811
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:50,149
it's also fascinating how constraints
somehow are essential for innovation

4812
01:27:50,149 --> 01:27:50,159
somehow are essential for innovation
 

4813
01:27:50,159 --> 01:27:51,030
somehow are essential for innovation
um

um
 

4815
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:52,550
um
and the other thing you mentioned about

4816
01:27:52,550 --> 01:27:52,560
and the other thing you mentioned about
 

4817
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:54,790
and the other thing you mentioned about
engineering i have a sneaking suspicion

4818
01:27:54,790 --> 01:27:54,800
engineering i have a sneaking suspicion
 

4819
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:55,830
engineering i have a sneaking suspicion
maybe i

4820
01:27:55,830 --> 01:27:55,840
maybe i
 

4821
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:57,110
maybe i
over

4822
01:27:57,110 --> 01:27:57,120
over
 

4823
01:27:57,120 --> 01:28:01,030
over
you know my love is with engineering so

4824
01:28:01,030 --> 01:28:01,040
you know my love is with engineering so
 

4825
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:03,350
you know my love is with engineering so
i have a sneaking suspicion that all the

4826
01:28:03,350 --> 01:28:03,360
i have a sneaking suspicion that all the
 

4827
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:04,470
i have a sneaking suspicion that all the
genius

4828
01:28:04,470 --> 01:28:04,480
genius
 

4829
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:06,629
genius
a large percentage of the genius is in

4830
01:28:06,629 --> 01:28:06,639
a large percentage of the genius is in
 

4831
01:28:06,639 --> 01:28:09,189
a large percentage of the genius is in
the tiny details of engineering

4832
01:28:09,189 --> 01:28:09,199
the tiny details of engineering
 

4833
01:28:09,199 --> 01:28:11,510
the tiny details of engineering
so like i think

4834
01:28:11,510 --> 01:28:11,520
so like i think
 

4835
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:14,070
so like i think
we like to think our genius our the

4836
01:28:14,070 --> 01:28:14,080
we like to think our genius our the
 

4837
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:16,790
we like to think our genius our the
genius is in the big ideas

4838
01:28:16,790 --> 01:28:16,800
genius is in the big ideas
 

4839
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:19,350
genius is in the big ideas
there's i have a sneaking suspicion that

4840
01:28:19,350 --> 01:28:19,360
there's i have a sneaking suspicion that
 

4841
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:21,669
there's i have a sneaking suspicion that
like because i've seen the genius of

4842
01:28:21,669 --> 01:28:21,679
like because i've seen the genius of
 

4843
01:28:21,679 --> 01:28:24,470
like because i've seen the genius of
details of engineering details

4844
01:28:24,470 --> 01:28:24,480
details of engineering details
 

4845
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:26,709
details of engineering details
make uh

4846
01:28:26,709 --> 01:28:26,719
make uh
 

4847
01:28:26,719 --> 01:28:27,910
make uh
like the make the night and day

4848
01:28:27,910 --> 01:28:27,920
like the make the night and day
 

4849
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:30,149
like the make the night and day
difference and i wonder if those kind of

4850
01:28:30,149 --> 01:28:30,159
difference and i wonder if those kind of
 

4851
01:28:30,159 --> 01:28:32,870
difference and i wonder if those kind of
have a ripple effect over time

4852
01:28:32,870 --> 01:28:32,880
have a ripple effect over time
 

4853
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:35,110
have a ripple effect over time
so that that too so that's that's sort

4854
01:28:35,110 --> 01:28:35,120
so that that too so that's that's sort
 

4855
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:36,229
so that that too so that's that's sort
of the taking the engineering

4856
01:28:36,229 --> 01:28:36,239
of the taking the engineering
 

4857
01:28:36,239 --> 01:28:38,709
of the taking the engineering
perspective that sometimes that quiet

4858
01:28:38,709 --> 01:28:38,719
perspective that sometimes that quiet
 

4859
01:28:38,719 --> 01:28:40,790
perspective that sometimes that quiet
innovation at the level of an individual

4860
01:28:40,790 --> 01:28:40,800
innovation at the level of an individual
 

4861
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:43,350
innovation at the level of an individual
engineer or maybe at the small scale of

4862
01:28:43,350 --> 01:28:43,360
engineer or maybe at the small scale of
 

4863
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:45,110
engineer or maybe at the small scale of
a few engineers can make all the

4864
01:28:45,110 --> 01:28:45,120
a few engineers can make all the
 

4865
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:46,709
a few engineers can make all the
difference that scales

4866
01:28:46,709 --> 01:28:46,719
difference that scales
 

4867
01:28:46,719 --> 01:28:48,310
difference that scales
because we're doing

4868
01:28:48,310 --> 01:28:48,320
because we're doing
 

4869
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:50,790
because we're doing
we're working on computers that are

4870
01:28:50,790 --> 01:28:50,800
we're working on computers that are
 

4871
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:53,350
we're working on computers that are
scaled across large groups

4872
01:28:53,350 --> 01:28:53,360
scaled across large groups
 

4873
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:55,430
scaled across large groups
that one engineering decision can lead

4874
01:28:55,430 --> 01:28:55,440
that one engineering decision can lead
 

4875
01:28:55,440 --> 01:28:57,669
that one engineering decision can lead
to ripple effects yes it's interesting

4876
01:28:57,669 --> 01:28:57,679
to ripple effects yes it's interesting
 

4877
01:28:57,679 --> 01:29:00,709
to ripple effects yes it's interesting
to think about yeah i mean engineering

4878
01:29:00,709 --> 01:29:00,719
to think about yeah i mean engineering
 

4879
01:29:00,719 --> 01:29:01,830
to think about yeah i mean engineering
there's also

4880
01:29:01,830 --> 01:29:01,840
there's also
 

4881
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:04,149
there's also
kind of a historical

4882
01:29:04,149 --> 01:29:04,159
kind of a historical
 

4883
01:29:04,159 --> 01:29:06,229
kind of a historical
it might be a bit random

4884
01:29:06,229 --> 01:29:06,239
it might be a bit random
 

4885
01:29:06,239 --> 01:29:08,950
it might be a bit random
because if you think of the history of

4886
01:29:08,950 --> 01:29:08,960
because if you think of the history of
 

4887
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:10,950
because if you think of the history of
how especially deep learning and neural

4888
01:29:10,950 --> 01:29:10,960
how especially deep learning and neural
 

4889
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:13,830
how especially deep learning and neural
networks took off feels like

4890
01:29:13,830 --> 01:29:13,840
networks took off feels like
 

4891
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:16,709
networks took off feels like
a bit random because gpus happened to be

4892
01:29:16,709 --> 01:29:16,719
a bit random because gpus happened to be
 

4893
01:29:16,719 --> 01:29:18,390
a bit random because gpus happened to be
there at the right time for a different

4894
01:29:18,390 --> 01:29:18,400
there at the right time for a different
 

4895
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:21,510
there at the right time for a different
purpose which was to play video games so

4896
01:29:21,510 --> 01:29:21,520
purpose which was to play video games so
 

4897
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:23,669
purpose which was to play video games so
even the engineering that goes into the

4898
01:29:23,669 --> 01:29:23,679
even the engineering that goes into the
 

4899
01:29:23,679 --> 01:29:24,790
even the engineering that goes into the
hardware

4900
01:29:24,790 --> 01:29:24,800
hardware
 

4901
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:26,950
hardware
and it might have a time like the time

4902
01:29:26,950 --> 01:29:26,960
and it might have a time like the time
 

4903
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:28,149
and it might have a time like the time
frame might be very different i mean

4904
01:29:28,149 --> 01:29:28,159
frame might be very different i mean
 

4905
01:29:28,159 --> 01:29:30,950
frame might be very different i mean
these the gpus were evolved throughout

4906
01:29:30,950 --> 01:29:30,960
these the gpus were evolved throughout
 

4907
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:32,790
these the gpus were evolved throughout
many years where we didn't even were

4908
01:29:32,790 --> 01:29:32,800
many years where we didn't even were
 

4909
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:34,950
many years where we didn't even were
looking at that right so even at that

4910
01:29:34,950 --> 01:29:34,960
looking at that right so even at that
 

4911
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:37,510
looking at that right so even at that
level right that revolution so to speak

4912
01:29:37,510 --> 01:29:37,520
level right that revolution so to speak
 

4913
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:38,550
level right that revolution so to speak
um

4914
01:29:38,550 --> 01:29:38,560
um
 

4915
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:40,790
um
the ripples are like like

4916
01:29:40,790 --> 01:29:40,800
the ripples are like like
 

4917
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:42,790
the ripples are like like
we'll see when they stop right but in

4918
01:29:42,790 --> 01:29:42,800
we'll see when they stop right but in
 

4919
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:45,110
we'll see when they stop right but in
terms of thinking of why is this

4920
01:29:45,110 --> 01:29:45,120
terms of thinking of why is this
 

4921
01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:47,189
terms of thinking of why is this
happening right there's there's i think

4922
01:29:47,189 --> 01:29:47,199
happening right there's there's i think
 

4923
01:29:47,199 --> 01:29:50,070
happening right there's there's i think
that when i try to categorize it in sort

4924
01:29:50,070 --> 01:29:50,080
that when i try to categorize it in sort
 

4925
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:51,030
that when i try to categorize it in sort
of

4926
01:29:51,030 --> 01:29:51,040
of
 

4927
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:52,629
of
things that might not be so obvious i

4928
01:29:52,629 --> 01:29:52,639
things that might not be so obvious i
 

4929
01:29:52,639 --> 01:29:53,830
things that might not be so obvious i
mean clearly there's a hardware

4930
01:29:53,830 --> 01:29:53,840
mean clearly there's a hardware
 

4931
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:55,830
mean clearly there's a hardware
revolution we are

4932
01:29:55,830 --> 01:29:55,840
revolution we are
 

4933
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:59,110
revolution we are
surfing thanks to that um data centers

4934
01:29:59,110 --> 01:29:59,120
surfing thanks to that um data centers
 

4935
01:29:59,120 --> 01:30:01,189
surfing thanks to that um data centers
as well i mean data centers

4936
01:30:01,189 --> 01:30:01,199
as well i mean data centers
 

4937
01:30:01,199 --> 01:30:02,709
as well i mean data centers
are where like i mean at google for

4938
01:30:02,709 --> 01:30:02,719
are where like i mean at google for
 

4939
01:30:02,719 --> 01:30:04,310
are where like i mean at google for
instance obviously they're serving

4940
01:30:04,310 --> 01:30:04,320
instance obviously they're serving
 

4941
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:06,550
instance obviously they're serving
google but there's also now thanks to

4942
01:30:06,550 --> 01:30:06,560
google but there's also now thanks to
 

4943
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:09,189
google but there's also now thanks to
that and to have built such amazing data

4944
01:30:09,189 --> 01:30:09,199
that and to have built such amazing data
 

4945
01:30:09,199 --> 01:30:11,669
that and to have built such amazing data
centers we can train these models um

4946
01:30:11,669 --> 01:30:11,679
centers we can train these models um
 

4947
01:30:11,679 --> 01:30:14,870
centers we can train these models um
software is an important one i think

4948
01:30:14,870 --> 01:30:14,880
software is an important one i think
 

4949
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:17,669
software is an important one i think
if i look at the state of how i had to

4950
01:30:17,669 --> 01:30:17,679
if i look at the state of how i had to
 

4951
01:30:17,679 --> 01:30:19,910
if i look at the state of how i had to
implement things to implement my ideas

4952
01:30:19,910 --> 01:30:19,920
implement things to implement my ideas
 

4953
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:21,669
implement things to implement my ideas
how i discarded ideas because they were

4954
01:30:21,669 --> 01:30:21,679
how i discarded ideas because they were
 

4955
01:30:21,679 --> 01:30:23,030
how i discarded ideas because they were
too hard to implement

4956
01:30:23,030 --> 01:30:23,040
too hard to implement
 

4957
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:24,870
too hard to implement
yeah clearly the chat the times have

4958
01:30:24,870 --> 01:30:24,880
yeah clearly the chat the times have
 

4959
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:27,189
yeah clearly the chat the times have
changed and thankfully we are in a much

4960
01:30:27,189 --> 01:30:27,199
changed and thankfully we are in a much
 

4961
01:30:27,199 --> 01:30:29,270
changed and thankfully we are in a much
better software position as well

4962
01:30:29,270 --> 01:30:29,280
better software position as well
 

4963
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:30,709
better software position as well
and then

4964
01:30:30,709 --> 01:30:30,719
and then
 

4965
01:30:30,719 --> 01:30:32,310
and then
i mean obviously there's research that

4966
01:30:32,310 --> 01:30:32,320
i mean obviously there's research that
 

4967
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:34,550
i mean obviously there's research that
happens at scale and more people enter

4968
01:30:34,550 --> 01:30:34,560
happens at scale and more people enter
 

4969
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:36,310
happens at scale and more people enter
the field that's great to see but it's

4970
01:30:36,310 --> 01:30:36,320
the field that's great to see but it's
 

4971
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:38,229
the field that's great to see but it's
almost enabled by these other things and

4972
01:30:38,229 --> 01:30:38,239
almost enabled by these other things and
 

4973
01:30:38,239 --> 01:30:40,470
almost enabled by these other things and
last but not least is also data right

4974
01:30:40,470 --> 01:30:40,480
last but not least is also data right
 

4975
01:30:40,480 --> 01:30:42,950
last but not least is also data right
curating data sets labeling data sets

4976
01:30:42,950 --> 01:30:42,960
curating data sets labeling data sets
 

4977
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:45,189
curating data sets labeling data sets
these benchmarks we think about maybe

4978
01:30:45,189 --> 01:30:45,199
these benchmarks we think about maybe
 

4979
01:30:45,199 --> 01:30:47,430
these benchmarks we think about maybe
we'll we'll want to have all the

4980
01:30:47,430 --> 01:30:47,440
we'll we'll want to have all the
 

4981
01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:49,430
we'll we'll want to have all the
benchmarks in one system but it's still

4982
01:30:49,430 --> 01:30:49,440
benchmarks in one system but it's still
 

4983
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:51,510
benchmarks in one system but it's still
very valuable that someone put the

4984
01:30:51,510 --> 01:30:51,520
very valuable that someone put the
 

4985
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:53,590
very valuable that someone put the

4987
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:55,510
thought and the time and the vision to
build certain benchmarks we've we've

4988
01:30:55,510 --> 01:30:55,520
build certain benchmarks we've we've
 

4989
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:57,590
build certain benchmarks we've we've
seen progress thanks to but

4990
01:30:57,590 --> 01:30:57,600
seen progress thanks to but
 

4991
01:30:57,600 --> 01:30:59,189
seen progress thanks to but
we're gonna repurpose the benchmarks

4992
01:30:59,189 --> 01:30:59,199
we're gonna repurpose the benchmarks
 

4993
01:30:59,199 --> 01:31:01,510
we're gonna repurpose the benchmarks
that's the beauty of atari

4994
01:31:01,510 --> 01:31:01,520
that's the beauty of atari
 

4995
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:02,870
that's the beauty of atari
is like

4996
01:31:02,870 --> 01:31:02,880
is like
 

4997
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:04,870
is like
we solved it in a way but

4998
01:31:04,870 --> 01:31:04,880
we solved it in a way but
 

4999
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:06,870
we solved it in a way but
we use it in gato it was critical and

5000
01:31:06,870 --> 01:31:06,880
we use it in gato it was critical and
 

5001
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:08,550
we use it in gato it was critical and
i'm sure it's there's there's still a

5002
01:31:08,550 --> 01:31:08,560
i'm sure it's there's there's still a
 

5003
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:10,310
i'm sure it's there's there's still a
lot more to do thanks to that amazing

5004
01:31:10,310 --> 01:31:10,320
lot more to do thanks to that amazing
 

5005
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:12,790
lot more to do thanks to that amazing

oh you have to think what's the next

5010
01:31:17,270 --> 01:31:17,280
oh you have to think what's the next

you know iteration of architectures

5012
01:31:19,350 --> 01:31:19,360
you know iteration of architectures
 

5013
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:21,350
you know iteration of architectures
that's what maybe the field recognizes

5014
01:31:21,350 --> 01:31:21,360
that's what maybe the field recognizes
 

5015
01:31:21,360 --> 01:31:23,189
that's what maybe the field recognizes
but we need to that's another thing we

5016
01:31:23,189 --> 01:31:23,199
but we need to that's another thing we
 

5017
01:31:23,199 --> 01:31:24,950
but we need to that's another thing we
need to balance in terms of humans

5018
01:31:24,950 --> 01:31:24,960

5021
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:29,750

01:33:34,870 --> 01:33:34,880
romantic or is there literally some
 

5147
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:36,470
romantic or is there literally some
level of which we start to see

5148
01:33:36,470 --> 01:33:36,480
level of which we start to see
 

5149
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:38,070
level of which we start to see
breakthrough performance

5150
01:33:38,070 --> 01:33:38,080
breakthrough performance
 

5151
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:40,550
breakthrough performance
yeah i mean this is a property that we

5152
01:33:40,550 --> 01:33:40,560
yeah i mean this is a property that we
 

5153
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:41,910
yeah i mean this is a property that we
start seeing

5154
01:33:41,910 --> 01:33:41,920
start seeing
 

5155
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:45,030
start seeing
um in systems that actually

5156
01:33:45,030 --> 01:33:45,040
um in systems that actually
 

5157
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:46,790
um in systems that actually
tend to be

5158
01:33:46,790 --> 01:33:46,800
tend to be
 

5159
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:50,149
tend to be
so in machine learning traditionally

5160
01:33:50,149 --> 01:33:50,159
so in machine learning traditionally
 

5161
01:33:50,159 --> 01:33:52,310
so in machine learning traditionally
again going to benchmarks i mean if if

5162
01:33:52,310 --> 01:33:52,320
again going to benchmarks i mean if if
 

5163
01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:54,870
again going to benchmarks i mean if if
you have a some input outputs right like

5164
01:33:54,870 --> 01:33:54,880
you have a some input outputs right like
 

5165
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:55,830
you have a some input outputs right like
that is

5166
01:33:55,830 --> 01:33:55,840
that is
 

5167
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:58,149
that is
just a single input and a single output

5168
01:33:58,149 --> 01:33:58,159
just a single input and a single output
 

5169
01:33:58,159 --> 01:33:59,590
just a single input and a single output
you generally

5170
01:33:59,590 --> 01:33:59,600
you generally
 

5171
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:02,070
you generally
um when you train these systems you see

5172
01:34:02,070 --> 01:34:02,080
um when you train these systems you see
 

5173
01:34:02,080 --> 01:34:03,750
um when you train these systems you see
reasonably smooth

5174
01:34:03,750 --> 01:34:03,760
reasonably smooth
 

5175
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:06,790
reasonably smooth
curves when you analyze how

5176
01:34:06,790 --> 01:34:06,800
curves when you analyze how
 

5177
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:08,709
curves when you analyze how
how much the data

5178
01:34:08,709 --> 01:34:08,719
how much the data
 

5179
01:34:08,719 --> 01:34:11,110
how much the data
set size affects the performance or how

5180
01:34:11,110 --> 01:34:11,120
set size affects the performance or how
 

5181
01:34:11,120 --> 01:34:13,030
set size affects the performance or how
the model size affect the performance or

5182
01:34:13,030 --> 01:34:13,040
the model size affect the performance or
 

5183
01:34:13,040 --> 01:34:15,750
the model size affect the performance or
how much you long train you how how long

5184
01:34:15,750 --> 01:34:15,760
how much you long train you how how long
 

5185
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:17,750
how much you long train you how how long
you train the system for

5186
01:34:17,750 --> 01:34:17,760
you train the system for
 

5187
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:20,149
you train the system for
affects the performance right so

5188
01:34:20,149 --> 01:34:20,159
affects the performance right so
 

5189
01:34:20,159 --> 01:34:22,070
affects the performance right so
you know if we think of imagenet like

5190
01:34:22,070 --> 01:34:22,080
you know if we think of imagenet like
 

5191
01:34:22,080 --> 01:34:23,750
you know if we think of imagenet like
the train curves look

5192
01:34:23,750 --> 01:34:23,760
the train curves look
 

5193
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:26,790
the train curves look
fairly smooth and predictable in a way

5194
01:34:26,790 --> 01:34:26,800
fairly smooth and predictable in a way
 

5195
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:27,990
fairly smooth and predictable in a way
um

5196
01:34:27,990 --> 01:34:28,000
um
 

5197
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:28,790
um
and

5198
01:34:28,790 --> 01:34:28,800
and
 

5199
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:30,550
and
i would say that's probably because of

5200
01:34:30,550 --> 01:34:30,560
i would say that's probably because of
 

5201
01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:31,189
i would say that's probably because of
the

5202
01:34:31,189 --> 01:34:31,199
the
 

5203
01:34:31,199 --> 01:34:32,709
the
it's kind of a one

5204
01:34:32,709 --> 01:34:32,719
it's kind of a one
 

5205
01:34:32,719 --> 01:34:34,229
it's kind of a one
a one hop

5206
01:34:34,229 --> 01:34:34,239
a one hop
 

5207
01:34:34,239 --> 01:34:35,350
a one hop
um

5208
01:34:35,350 --> 01:34:35,360
um
 

5209
01:34:35,360 --> 01:34:37,350
um
reasoning task right it's like here is

5210
01:34:37,350 --> 01:34:37,360
reasoning task right it's like here is
 

5211
01:34:37,360 --> 01:34:39,910
reasoning task right it's like here is
an input and you think for a few

5212
01:34:39,910 --> 01:34:39,920
an input and you think for a few
 

5213
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:42,790
an input and you think for a few
milliseconds or 100 milliseconds 300 as

5214
01:34:42,790 --> 01:34:42,800
milliseconds or 100 milliseconds 300 as
 

5215
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:44,709
milliseconds or 100 milliseconds 300 as
a human and then you tell me yeah

5216
01:34:44,709 --> 01:34:44,719
a human and then you tell me yeah
 

5217
01:34:44,719 --> 01:34:45,510
a human and then you tell me yeah
there's

5218
01:34:45,510 --> 01:34:45,520
there's
 

5219
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:47,830
there's
there's an alpaca in this image

5220
01:34:47,830 --> 01:34:47,840
there's an alpaca in this image
 

5221
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:49,669
there's an alpaca in this image
so

5222
01:34:49,669 --> 01:34:49,679
so
 

5223
01:34:49,679 --> 01:34:51,030
so
in language

5224
01:34:51,030 --> 01:34:51,040
in language
 

5225
01:34:51,040 --> 01:34:55,189
in language
we are seeing benchmarks that require

5226
01:34:55,189 --> 01:34:55,199
we are seeing benchmarks that require
 

5227
01:34:55,199 --> 01:34:57,030
we are seeing benchmarks that require
more pondering and more

5228
01:34:57,030 --> 01:34:57,040
more pondering and more
 

5229
01:34:57,040 --> 01:34:58,709
more pondering and more
thought in a way right this is just kind

5230
01:34:58,709 --> 01:34:58,719
thought in a way right this is just kind
 

5231
01:34:58,719 --> 01:35:00,790
thought in a way right this is just kind
of you you you need to look for some

5232
01:35:00,790 --> 01:35:00,800
of you you you need to look for some
 

5233
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:02,149
of you you you need to look for some
subtleties

5234
01:35:02,149 --> 01:35:02,159
subtleties
 

5235
01:35:02,159 --> 01:35:03,750
subtleties
that it involves

5236
01:35:03,750 --> 01:35:03,760
that it involves
 

5237
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:05,750
that it involves
inputs that you you might think of or if

5238
01:35:05,750 --> 01:35:05,760
inputs that you you might think of or if
 

5239
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:07,750
inputs that you you might think of or if
even if the input is a sentence

5240
01:35:07,750 --> 01:35:07,760
even if the input is a sentence
 

5241
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:10,790
even if the input is a sentence
describing a mathematical problem um

5242
01:35:10,790 --> 01:35:10,800
describing a mathematical problem um
 

5243
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:13,030
describing a mathematical problem um
there is there is a bit more processing

5244
01:35:13,030 --> 01:35:13,040
there is there is a bit more processing
 

5245
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:14,390
there is there is a bit more processing
required as a human and more

5246
01:35:14,390 --> 01:35:14,400
required as a human and more
 

5247
01:35:14,400 --> 01:35:16,390
required as a human and more
introspection so

5248
01:35:16,390 --> 01:35:16,400
introspection so
 

5249
01:35:16,400 --> 01:35:17,270
introspection so
i think

5250
01:35:17,270 --> 01:35:17,280
i think
 

5251
01:35:17,280 --> 01:35:18,550
i think
the

5252
01:35:18,550 --> 01:35:18,560
the
 

5253
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:20,550
the
how these benchmarks work

5254
01:35:20,550 --> 01:35:20,560
how these benchmarks work
 

5255
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:23,669
how these benchmarks work
means that there is actually a threshold

5256
01:35:23,669 --> 01:35:23,679
means that there is actually a threshold
 

5257
01:35:23,679 --> 01:35:24,629
means that there is actually a threshold
um

5258
01:35:24,629 --> 01:35:24,639
um
 

5259
01:35:24,639 --> 01:35:26,629
um
just going back to how transformers work

5260
01:35:26,629 --> 01:35:26,639
just going back to how transformers work
 

5261
01:35:26,639 --> 01:35:28,870
just going back to how transformers work
in this way of querying for the right

5262
01:35:28,870 --> 01:35:28,880
in this way of querying for the right
 

5263
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:31,430
in this way of querying for the right
questions to get the right answers that

5264
01:35:31,430 --> 01:35:31,440
questions to get the right answers that
 

5265
01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:32,709
questions to get the right answers that
might mean that

5266
01:35:32,709 --> 01:35:32,719
might mean that
 

5267
01:35:32,719 --> 01:35:35,430
might mean that
performance becomes random

5268
01:35:35,430 --> 01:35:35,440
performance becomes random
 

5269
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:38,229
performance becomes random
until the right question is asked by the

5270
01:35:38,229 --> 01:35:38,239
until the right question is asked by the
 

5271
01:35:38,239 --> 01:35:40,470
until the right question is asked by the
querying system of a transformer or of a

5272
01:35:40,470 --> 01:35:40,480
querying system of a transformer or of a
 

5273
01:35:40,480 --> 01:35:42,950
querying system of a transformer or of a
language model like a transformer and

5274
01:35:42,950 --> 01:35:42,960
language model like a transformer and
 

5275
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:44,070
language model like a transformer and
then

5276
01:35:44,070 --> 01:35:44,080
then
 

5277
01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:47,030
then
only only then you might start seeing

5278
01:35:47,030 --> 01:35:47,040
only only then you might start seeing
 

5279
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:48,790
only only then you might start seeing
performance going from random to

5280
01:35:48,790 --> 01:35:48,800
performance going from random to
 

5281
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:49,990
performance going from random to
non-random

5282
01:35:49,990 --> 01:35:50,000
non-random
 

5283
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:51,189
non-random
and

5284
01:35:51,189 --> 01:35:51,199
and
 

5285
01:35:51,199 --> 01:35:53,270
and
this is more empirical there's there's

5286
01:35:53,270 --> 01:35:53,280
this is more empirical there's there's
 

5287
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:56,149
this is more empirical there's there's
no formalism or theory behind this yet

5288
01:35:56,149 --> 01:35:56,159
no formalism or theory behind this yet
 

5289
01:35:56,159 --> 01:35:58,470
no formalism or theory behind this yet
although it might be quite important but

5290
01:35:58,470 --> 01:35:58,480
although it might be quite important but
 

5291
01:35:58,480 --> 01:36:00,790
although it might be quite important but
we're seeing these phase transitions of

5292
01:36:00,790 --> 01:36:00,800
we're seeing these phase transitions of
 

5293
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:03,350
we're seeing these phase transitions of
random performance and until some let's

5294
01:36:03,350 --> 01:36:03,360
random performance and until some let's
 

5295
01:36:03,360 --> 01:36:05,669
random performance and until some let's
say scale of a model and then it goes

5296
01:36:05,669 --> 01:36:05,679
say scale of a model and then it goes
 

5297
01:36:05,679 --> 01:36:08,870
say scale of a model and then it goes
beyond that and it might be that

5298
01:36:08,870 --> 01:36:08,880
beyond that and it might be that
 

5299
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:10,390
beyond that and it might be that
you need to fit

5300
01:36:10,390 --> 01:36:10,400
you need to fit
 

5301
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:11,510
you need to fit
a few

5302
01:36:11,510 --> 01:36:11,520
a few
 

5303
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:13,990
a few
low order bits of thought

5304
01:36:13,990 --> 01:36:14,000
low order bits of thought
 

5305
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,149
low order bits of thought
before you can make progress on the

5306
01:36:16,149 --> 01:36:16,159
before you can make progress on the
 

5307
01:36:16,159 --> 01:36:18,470
before you can make progress on the
whole task and if you could measure

5308
01:36:18,470 --> 01:36:18,480
whole task and if you could measure
 

5309
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:19,669
whole task and if you could measure
actually

5310
01:36:19,669 --> 01:36:19,679
actually
 

5311
01:36:19,679 --> 01:36:22,070
actually
those breakdown of the task maybe you

5312
01:36:22,070 --> 01:36:22,080
those breakdown of the task maybe you
 

5313
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:24,390
those breakdown of the task maybe you
would see more smooth oh like yeah these

5314
01:36:24,390 --> 01:36:24,400
would see more smooth oh like yeah these
 

5315
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:26,229
would see more smooth oh like yeah these
you know once once you get these and

5316
01:36:26,229 --> 01:36:26,239
you know once once you get these and
 

5317
01:36:26,239 --> 01:36:27,990
you know once once you get these and
these and these and this and these then

5318
01:36:27,990 --> 01:36:28,000
these and these and this and these then
 

5319
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,149
these and these and this and these then
you start making progress in the task

5320
01:36:30,149 --> 01:36:30,159
you start making progress in the task
 

5321
01:36:30,159 --> 01:36:32,149
you start making progress in the task
but it's somehow

5322
01:36:32,149 --> 01:36:32,159
but it's somehow
 

5323
01:36:32,159 --> 01:36:34,950
but it's somehow
um a bit annoying because then

5324
01:36:34,950 --> 01:36:34,960
um a bit annoying because then
 

5325
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:36,870
um a bit annoying because then
it means that certain

5326
01:36:36,870 --> 01:36:36,880
it means that certain
 

5327
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:38,390
it means that certain
questions we might ask about

5328
01:36:38,390 --> 01:36:38,400
questions we might ask about
 

5329
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:40,149
questions we might ask about
architectures

5330
01:36:40,149 --> 01:36:40,159
architectures
 

5331
01:36:40,159 --> 01:36:42,229
architectures
possibly cannot only be done at certain

5332
01:36:42,229 --> 01:36:42,239
possibly cannot only be done at certain
 

5333
01:36:42,239 --> 01:36:43,830
possibly cannot only be done at certain
scale and

5334
01:36:43,830 --> 01:36:43,840
scale and
 

5335
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:45,350
scale and
one thing that

5336
01:36:45,350 --> 01:36:45,360
one thing that
 

5337
01:36:45,360 --> 01:36:47,510
one thing that
conversely i've seen great progress on

5338
01:36:47,510 --> 01:36:47,520
conversely i've seen great progress on
 

5339
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:50,310
conversely i've seen great progress on
in the last couple years is this notion

5340
01:36:50,310 --> 01:36:50,320
in the last couple years is this notion
 

5341
01:36:50,320 --> 01:36:52,390
in the last couple years is this notion
of science of deep learning

5342
01:36:52,390 --> 01:36:52,400
of science of deep learning
 

5343
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:54,950
of science of deep learning
and science of scale in particular right

5344
01:36:54,950 --> 01:36:54,960
and science of scale in particular right
 

5345
01:36:54,960 --> 01:36:55,990
and science of scale in particular right
so

5346
01:36:55,990 --> 01:36:56,000
so
 

5347
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:57,669
so
on the negative is that there's some

5348
01:36:57,669 --> 01:36:57,679
on the negative is that there's some
 

5349
01:36:57,679 --> 01:37:01,030
on the negative is that there's some
benchmarks for which progress might need

5350
01:37:01,030 --> 01:37:01,040
benchmarks for which progress might need
 

5351
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:03,109
benchmarks for which progress might need
to be measured at at minimum at a

5352
01:37:03,109 --> 01:37:03,119
to be measured at at minimum at a
 

5353
01:37:03,119 --> 01:37:05,990
to be measured at at minimum at a
certain scale until you see then what

5354
01:37:05,990 --> 01:37:06,000
certain scale until you see then what
 

5355
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,229
certain scale until you see then what
details of the model matter to make that

5356
01:37:08,229 --> 01:37:08,239
details of the model matter to make that
 

5357
01:37:08,239 --> 01:37:10,870
details of the model matter to make that
performance better right so that's a bit

5358
01:37:10,870 --> 01:37:10,880
performance better right so that's a bit
 

5359
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:13,030
performance better right so that's a bit
of a con but

5360
01:37:13,030 --> 01:37:13,040
of a con but
 

5361
01:37:13,040 --> 01:37:16,149
of a con but
what we've also seen is that you can

5362
01:37:16,149 --> 01:37:16,159
what we've also seen is that you can
 

5363
01:37:16,159 --> 01:37:18,550
what we've also seen is that you can
you can sort of empirically analyze

5364
01:37:18,550 --> 01:37:18,560
you can sort of empirically analyze
 

5365
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:21,910
you can sort of empirically analyze
behavior of models at scales that are

5366
01:37:21,910 --> 01:37:21,920
behavior of models at scales that are
 

5367
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:24,229
behavior of models at scales that are
smaller right so let's say to put an

5368
01:37:24,229 --> 01:37:24,239
smaller right so let's say to put an
 

5369
01:37:24,239 --> 01:37:27,750
smaller right so let's say to put an
example um we had this chinchilla paper

5370
01:37:27,750 --> 01:37:27,760
example um we had this chinchilla paper
 

5371
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:30,229
example um we had this chinchilla paper
that revised the so-called scaling laws

5372
01:37:30,229 --> 01:37:30,239
that revised the so-called scaling laws
 

5373
01:37:30,239 --> 01:37:33,109
that revised the so-called scaling laws
of models and that whole study is done

5374
01:37:33,109 --> 01:37:33,119
of models and that whole study is done
 

5375
01:37:33,119 --> 01:37:35,350
of models and that whole study is done
at a reasonably small scale right maybe

5376
01:37:35,350 --> 01:37:35,360
at a reasonably small scale right maybe
 

5377
01:37:35,360 --> 01:37:37,350
at a reasonably small scale right maybe
hundreds of millions up to one billion

5378
01:37:37,350 --> 01:37:37,360
hundreds of millions up to one billion
 

5379
01:37:37,360 --> 01:37:39,669
hundreds of millions up to one billion
parameters and then the cool thing is

5380
01:37:39,669 --> 01:37:39,679
parameters and then the cool thing is
 

5381
01:37:39,679 --> 01:37:41,990
parameters and then the cool thing is
that you create some loss right some

5382
01:37:41,990 --> 01:37:42,000
that you create some loss right some
 

5383
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:43,910
that you create some loss right some
loss that some trends right you you

5384
01:37:43,910 --> 01:37:43,920
loss that some trends right you you
 

5385
01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:46,229
loss that some trends right you you
extract trends from data that you see

5386
01:37:46,229 --> 01:37:46,239
extract trends from data that you see
 

5387
01:37:46,239 --> 01:37:48,550
extract trends from data that you see
okay like it looks like the amount of

5388
01:37:48,550 --> 01:37:48,560
okay like it looks like the amount of
 

5389
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:50,870
okay like it looks like the amount of
data required to train now a 10x larger

5390
01:37:50,870 --> 01:37:50,880
data required to train now a 10x larger
 

5391
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:53,189
data required to train now a 10x larger
model would be this and these laws so

5392
01:37:53,189 --> 01:37:53,199
model would be this and these laws so
 

5393
01:37:53,199 --> 01:37:56,149
model would be this and these laws so
far these extrapolations have helped us

5394
01:37:56,149 --> 01:37:56,159
far these extrapolations have helped us
 

5395
01:37:56,159 --> 01:37:59,510
far these extrapolations have helped us
save compute and just get to a better

sorts of questions we start asking

01:38:08,470 --> 01:38:08,480
sorts of questions we start asking
 

5405
01:38:08,480 --> 01:38:10,870

extrapolating from small scale but then

5406
01:38:10,870 --> 01:38:10,880
extrapolating from small scale but then
 

5407
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:13,189
extrapolating from small scale but then
this emergence is sadly that not

5408
01:38:13,189 --> 01:38:13,199
this emergence is sadly that not
 

5409
01:38:13,199 --> 01:38:15,189
this emergence is sadly that not
everything can be extrapolated from

01:38:15,189 --> 01:38:15,199
everything can be extrapolated from
 

5411
01:38:15,199 --> 01:38:16,950
everything can be extrapolated from
scale depending on the benchmark and

scale depending on the benchmark and
 

5413
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:19,910

maybe the harder benchmarks are not so

5414
01:38:19,910 --> 01:38:19,920
maybe the harder benchmarks are not so
 

5415
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:22,470
maybe the harder benchmarks are not so
good for extracting these laws but we

5416
01:38:22,470 --> 01:38:22,480
good for extracting these laws but we
 

5417
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:24,229
good for extracting these laws but we
have a variety of benchmarks at least so

5418
01:38:24,229 --> 01:38:24,239
have a variety of benchmarks at least so
 

5419
01:38:24,239 --> 01:38:25,350
have a variety of benchmarks at least so
i wonder

5420
01:38:25,350 --> 01:38:25,360
i wonder
 

5421
01:38:25,360 --> 01:38:26,870
i wonder
to which degree

5422
01:38:26,870 --> 01:38:26,880
to which degree
 

5423
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:29,350
to which degree

the threshold the phase shift
 

5425
01:38:29,360 --> 01:38:32,390
the threshold the phase shift
scale is a function of the benchmark

5426
01:38:32,390 --> 01:38:32,400
scale is a function of the benchmark
 

5427
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:34,310

some some of that some of the science

5428
01:38:34,310 --> 01:38:34,320
some some of that some of the science
 

5429
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:35,990
some some of that some of the science
the scale might be

5430
01:38:35,990 --> 01:38:36,000
the scale might be
 

5431
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,070
the scale might be
engineering benchmarks

5432
01:38:38,070 --> 01:38:38,080
engineering benchmarks
 

5433
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:40,310
engineering benchmarks
where that threshold is low

5434
01:38:40,310 --> 01:38:40,320
where that threshold is low
 

5435
01:38:40,320 --> 01:38:41,830
where that threshold is low
sort of taking

5436
01:38:41,830 --> 01:38:41,840
sort of taking
 

5437
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:43,750
sort of taking
a main benchmark

5438
01:38:43,750 --> 01:38:43,760
a main benchmark
 

5439
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:46,390
a main benchmark
and uh reducing it somehow or the

5440
01:38:46,390 --> 01:38:46,400
and uh reducing it somehow or the
 

5441
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:49,030
and uh reducing it somehow or the
essential difficulties left but the

5442
01:38:49,030 --> 01:38:49,040
essential difficulties left but the
 

5443
01:38:49,040 --> 01:38:50,709
essential difficulties left but the
emergent the scale at which the

5444
01:38:50,709 --> 01:38:50,719
emergent the scale at which the
 

5445
01:38:50,719 --> 01:38:53,030
emergent the scale at which the
emergence happens is lower just for the

5446
01:38:53,030 --> 01:38:53,040
emergence happens is lower just for the
 

5447
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:55,669
emergence happens is lower just for the
science aspect of it versus the actual

5448
01:38:55,669 --> 01:38:55,679
science aspect of it versus the actual
 

5449
01:38:55,679 --> 01:38:57,750
science aspect of it versus the actual
real world aspect yeah so luckily we

5450
01:38:57,750 --> 01:38:57,760
real world aspect yeah so luckily we
 

5451
01:38:57,760 --> 01:38:59,510
real world aspect yeah so luckily we
have quite a few benchmarks some of

5452
01:38:59,510 --> 01:38:59,520
have quite a few benchmarks some of
 

5453
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:01,270
have quite a few benchmarks some of
which are simpler or maybe they're more

5454
01:39:01,270 --> 01:39:01,280
which are simpler or maybe they're more
 

5455
01:39:01,280 --> 01:39:03,030
which are simpler or maybe they're more
like i think people might call this

5456
01:39:03,030 --> 01:39:03,040
like i think people might call this
 

5457
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:07,109
like i think people might call this
systems one versus systems2 style um so

5458
01:39:07,109 --> 01:39:07,119
systems one versus systems2 style um so
 

5459
01:39:07,119 --> 01:39:09,990
systems one versus systems2 style um so
i think what we're not seeing luckily is

5460
01:39:09,990 --> 01:39:10,000
i think what we're not seeing luckily is
 

5461
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:10,870
i think what we're not seeing luckily is
that

5462
01:39:10,870 --> 01:39:10,880
that
 

5463
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:13,590
that
extrapolations from maybe slightly more

5464
01:39:13,590 --> 01:39:13,600
extrapolations from maybe slightly more
 

5465
01:39:13,600 --> 01:39:15,910
extrapolations from maybe slightly more
smooth or simpler benchmarks are

5466
01:39:15,910 --> 01:39:15,920
smooth or simpler benchmarks are
 

5467
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:18,470
smooth or simpler benchmarks are
translating to the harder harder ones

5468
01:39:18,470 --> 01:39:18,480
translating to the harder harder ones
 

5469
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:20,310
translating to the harder harder ones
but that is not to say that this

5470
01:39:20,310 --> 01:39:20,320
but that is not to say that this
 

5471
01:39:20,320 --> 01:39:22,709
but that is not to say that this
extrapolation will hit its limits and

5472
01:39:22,709 --> 01:39:22,719
extrapolation will hit its limits and
 

5473
01:39:22,719 --> 01:39:24,149
extrapolation will hit its limits and
when it does

5474
01:39:24,149 --> 01:39:24,159
when it does
 

5475
01:39:24,159 --> 01:39:25,109
when it does
then

5476
01:39:25,109 --> 01:39:25,119
then
 

5477
01:39:25,119 --> 01:39:27,830
then
how much we scale or how we scale will

5478
01:39:27,830 --> 01:39:27,840
how much we scale or how we scale will
 

5479
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:30,070
how much we scale or how we scale will
sadly be a bit suboptimal until we find

5480
01:39:30,070 --> 01:39:30,080
sadly be a bit suboptimal until we find
 

5481
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:32,310
sadly be a bit suboptimal until we find
better loss right um and these laws

5482
01:39:32,310 --> 01:39:32,320
better loss right um and these laws
 

5483
01:39:32,320 --> 01:39:33,830
better loss right um and these laws
again are very empirical loss they're

5484
01:39:33,830 --> 01:39:33,840
again are very empirical loss they're
 

5485
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:35,830
again are very empirical loss they're
not like physical loss of models

5486
01:39:35,830 --> 01:39:35,840
not like physical loss of models
 

5487
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:37,270
not like physical loss of models
although i wish

5488
01:39:37,270 --> 01:39:37,280
although i wish
 

5489
01:39:37,280 --> 01:39:39,350
although i wish
there would be better theory about these

5490
01:39:39,350 --> 01:39:39,360
there would be better theory about these
 

5491
01:39:39,360 --> 01:39:41,669
there would be better theory about these
things as well but so far i would say

5492
01:39:41,669 --> 01:39:41,679
things as well but so far i would say
 

5493
01:39:41,679 --> 01:39:43,910
things as well but so far i would say
empirical theory as i call it is way

5494
01:39:43,910 --> 01:39:43,920
empirical theory as i call it is way
 

5495
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:46,310
empirical theory as i call it is way
ahead than actual theory of machine

5496
01:39:46,310 --> 01:39:46,320
ahead than actual theory of machine
 

5497
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:47,669
ahead than actual theory of machine
learning

5498
01:39:47,669 --> 01:39:47,679
learning
 

5499
01:39:47,679 --> 01:39:49,030
learning
let me ask you

5500
01:39:49,030 --> 01:39:49,040
let me ask you
 

5501
01:39:49,040 --> 01:39:52,390
let me ask you
almost for fun so this is not auriel as

5502
01:39:52,390 --> 01:39:52,400
almost for fun so this is not auriel as
 

5503
01:39:52,400 --> 01:39:55,830
almost for fun so this is not auriel as
a as a deep mind person or anything to

5504
01:39:55,830 --> 01:39:55,840
a as a deep mind person or anything to
 

5505
01:39:55,840 --> 01:39:57,669

01:39:57,669 --> 01:39:57,679
do with deep mind or google just as a
 

5507
01:39:57,679 --> 01:40:00,629
do with deep mind or google just as a
human being and looking at these news of

5508
01:40:00,629 --> 01:40:00,639
human being and looking at these news of
 

5509
01:40:00,639 --> 01:40:03,430
human being and looking at these news of
a google engineer who claimed

5510
01:40:03,430 --> 01:40:03,440
a google engineer who claimed
 

5511
01:40:03,440 --> 01:40:04,229
a google engineer who claimed
uh

5512
01:40:04,229 --> 01:40:04,239
uh
 

5513
01:40:04,239 --> 01:40:05,189
uh
that

5514
01:40:05,189 --> 01:40:05,199
that
 

5515
01:40:05,199 --> 01:40:08,790
that
uh i guess the lambda language model was

5516
01:40:08,790 --> 01:40:08,800
uh i guess the lambda language model was
 

5517
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:10,470
uh i guess the lambda language model was
sentient or

5518
01:40:10,470 --> 01:40:10,480
sentient or
 

5519
01:40:10,480 --> 01:40:12,709
sentient or
had the i still need to look into the

5520
01:40:12,709 --> 01:40:12,719
had the i still need to look into the
 

5521
01:40:12,719 --> 01:40:14,070
had the i still need to look into the
details of this

5522
01:40:14,070 --> 01:40:14,080
details of this
 

5523
01:40:14,080 --> 01:40:14,870
details of this
but

5524
01:40:14,870 --> 01:40:14,880
but
 

5525
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:16,070
but
sort of

5526
01:40:16,070 --> 01:40:16,080
sort of
 

5527
01:40:16,080 --> 01:40:18,550
sort of
making an official report

5528
01:40:18,550 --> 01:40:18,560
making an official report
 

5529
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:20,390
making an official report
and the claim that he believes there's

5530
01:40:20,390 --> 01:40:20,400
and the claim that he believes there's
 

5531
01:40:20,400 --> 01:40:21,590
and the claim that he believes there's
evidence

5532
01:40:21,590 --> 01:40:21,600
evidence
 

5533
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:24,149
evidence
that this system is has achieved

5534
01:40:24,149 --> 01:40:24,159
that this system is has achieved
 

5535
01:40:24,159 --> 01:40:27,030
that this system is has achieved
sentience and i think

5536
01:40:27,030 --> 01:40:27,040
sentience and i think
 

5537
01:40:27,040 --> 01:40:29,430
sentience and i think
this is a really interesting case

5538
01:40:29,430 --> 01:40:29,440
this is a really interesting case
 

5539
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:31,189
this is a really interesting case
on a human level and a psychological

5540
01:40:31,189 --> 01:40:31,199
on a human level and a psychological
 

5541
01:40:31,199 --> 01:40:33,910
on a human level and a psychological
level on a

5542
01:40:33,910 --> 01:40:33,920
level on a
 

5543
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:36,390
level on a
technical machine learning level of how

5544
01:40:36,390 --> 01:40:36,400
technical machine learning level of how
 

5545
01:40:36,400 --> 01:40:38,310
technical machine learning level of how
language models transform our world and

5546
01:40:38,310 --> 01:40:38,320
language models transform our world and
 

5547
01:40:38,320 --> 01:40:39,910
language models transform our world and
also just philosophical level of the

5548
01:40:39,910 --> 01:40:39,920
also just philosophical level of the
 

5549
01:40:39,920 --> 01:40:41,990
also just philosophical level of the
role of ai systems

5550
01:40:41,990 --> 01:40:42,000
role of ai systems
 

5551
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:45,510
role of ai systems
in um in a human world so

5552
01:40:45,510 --> 01:40:45,520
in um in a human world so
 

5553
01:40:45,520 --> 01:40:46,790
in um in a human world so
what did you what do you find

5554
01:40:46,790 --> 01:40:46,800
what did you what do you find
 

5555
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:47,990
what did you what do you find
interesting

5556
01:40:47,990 --> 01:40:48,000
interesting
 

5557
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,229
interesting
what's your take on all of this as

5558
01:40:50,229 --> 01:40:50,239
what's your take on all of this as
 

5559
01:40:50,239 --> 01:40:51,669
what's your take on all of this as
a machine learning engineer and a

5560
01:40:51,669 --> 01:40:51,679
a machine learning engineer and a
 

5561
01:40:51,679 --> 01:40:54,149
a machine learning engineer and a
researcher and also as a human being

5562
01:40:54,149 --> 01:40:54,159
researcher and also as a human being
 

5563
01:40:54,159 --> 01:40:56,709
researcher and also as a human being
yeah i mean a few reactions

5564
01:40:56,709 --> 01:40:56,719
yeah i mean a few reactions
 

5565
01:40:56,719 --> 01:41:00,629
yeah i mean a few reactions
um quite a few actually have you ever

5566
01:41:00,629 --> 01:41:00,639
um quite a few actually have you ever
 

5567
01:41:00,639 --> 01:41:02,470
um quite a few actually have you ever
briefly thought is this thing sanctuary

5568
01:41:02,470 --> 01:41:02,480
briefly thought is this thing sanctuary
 

5569
01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:05,270
briefly thought is this thing sanctuary
right so never absolutely like even with

5570
01:41:05,270 --> 01:41:05,280
right so never absolutely like even with
 

5571
01:41:05,280 --> 01:41:07,990
right so never absolutely like even with
like alpha star wait a minute what uh

5572
01:41:07,990 --> 01:41:08,000
like alpha star wait a minute what uh
 

5573
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,790
like alpha star wait a minute what uh
sadly though i think yeah sadly i i have

5574
01:41:10,790 --> 01:41:10,800
sadly though i think yeah sadly i i have
 

5575
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:13,350
sadly though i think yeah sadly i i have
not um yeah i think i think the current

5576
01:41:13,350 --> 01:41:13,360
not um yeah i think i think the current
 

5577
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:16,070
not um yeah i think i think the current
any of the current models although very

5578
01:41:16,070 --> 01:41:16,080
any of the current models although very
 

5579
01:41:16,080 --> 01:41:18,870
any of the current models although very
useful and very good um

5580
01:41:18,870 --> 01:41:18,880
useful and very good um
 

5581
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:22,310
useful and very good um
yeah i think we're quite far from that

5582
01:41:22,310 --> 01:41:22,320
yeah i think we're quite far from that
 

5583
01:41:22,320 --> 01:41:24,550
yeah i think we're quite far from that
and there's kind of a converse

5584
01:41:24,550 --> 01:41:24,560
and there's kind of a converse
 

5585
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:27,350
and there's kind of a converse
side story so one of one of the my

5586
01:41:27,350 --> 01:41:27,360
side story so one of one of the my
 

5587
01:41:27,360 --> 01:41:30,390
side story so one of one of the my
passions is about science in general and

5588
01:41:30,390 --> 01:41:30,400
passions is about science in general and
 

5589
01:41:30,400 --> 01:41:31,270
passions is about science in general and
i think

5590
01:41:31,270 --> 01:41:31,280
i think
 

5591
01:41:31,280 --> 01:41:33,189
i think
i feel i'm a bit of like a failed

5592
01:41:33,189 --> 01:41:33,199
i feel i'm a bit of like a failed
 

5593
01:41:33,199 --> 01:41:36,070
i feel i'm a bit of like a failed
scientist that's why i came to machine

5594
01:41:36,070 --> 01:41:36,080
scientist that's why i came to machine
 

5595
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:38,790
scientist that's why i came to machine
learning because you always feel and you

5596
01:41:38,790 --> 01:41:38,800
learning because you always feel and you
 

5597
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:41,189
learning because you always feel and you
start seeing this that machine learning

5598
01:41:41,189 --> 01:41:41,199
start seeing this that machine learning
 

5599
01:41:41,199 --> 01:41:42,390
start seeing this that machine learning
is maybe

5600
01:41:42,390 --> 01:41:42,400
is maybe
 

5601
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:44,470
is maybe
the science that can help other sciences

5602
01:41:44,470 --> 01:41:44,480
the science that can help other sciences
 

5603
01:41:44,480 --> 01:41:46,310
the science that can help other sciences
as we've seen right like you you know

5604
01:41:46,310 --> 01:41:46,320
as we've seen right like you you know
 

5605
01:41:46,320 --> 01:41:49,350
as we've seen right like you you know
it's such a powerful tool um so

5606
01:41:49,350 --> 01:41:49,360
it's such a powerful tool um so
 

5607
01:41:49,360 --> 01:41:51,750
it's such a powerful tool um so
thanks to that angle right that okay i

5608
01:41:51,750 --> 01:41:51,760
thanks to that angle right that okay i
 

5609
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:53,189
thanks to that angle right that okay i
love science i love i mean i love

5610
01:41:53,189 --> 01:41:53,199
love science i love i mean i love
 

5611
01:41:53,199 --> 01:41:55,430
love science i love i mean i love
astronomy i love biology but i'm not an

5612
01:41:55,430 --> 01:41:55,440
astronomy i love biology but i'm not an
 

5613
01:41:55,440 --> 01:41:57,590
astronomy i love biology but i'm not an
expert and i decided well the thing i

5614
01:41:57,590 --> 01:41:57,600
expert and i decided well the thing i
 

5615
01:41:57,600 --> 01:42:00,709
expert and i decided well the thing i
can do better at these computers but

5616
01:42:00,709 --> 01:42:00,719
can do better at these computers but
 

5617
01:42:00,719 --> 01:42:03,669
can do better at these computers but
having especially with when i was a bit

5618
01:42:03,669 --> 01:42:03,679
having especially with when i was a bit
 

5619
01:42:03,679 --> 01:42:05,750
having especially with when i was a bit
more involved in alpha fault learning a

5620
01:42:05,750 --> 01:42:05,760
more involved in alpha fault learning a
 

5621
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:08,790
more involved in alpha fault learning a
bit about proteins and about biology and

5622
01:42:08,790 --> 01:42:08,800
bit about proteins and about biology and
 

5623
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:09,669
bit about proteins and about biology and
about

5624
01:42:09,669 --> 01:42:09,679
about
 

5625
01:42:09,679 --> 01:42:10,550
about
life

5626
01:42:10,550 --> 01:42:10,560
life
 

5627
01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:11,350
life
um

5628
01:42:11,350 --> 01:42:11,360
um
 

5629
01:42:11,360 --> 01:42:12,950
um
the complexity

5630
01:42:12,950 --> 01:42:12,960
the complexity
 

5631
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:14,870
the complexity
it feels like it really is like i mean

5632
01:42:14,870 --> 01:42:14,880
it feels like it really is like i mean
 

5633
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:16,550
it feels like it really is like i mean
if you start looking at

5634
01:42:16,550 --> 01:42:16,560
if you start looking at
 

5635
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:19,109
if you start looking at
the things that are going on um

5636
01:42:19,109 --> 01:42:19,119
the things that are going on um
 

5637
01:42:19,119 --> 01:42:22,629
the things that are going on um
at you know at that atomic level um

5638
01:42:22,629 --> 01:42:22,639
at you know at that atomic level um
 

5639
01:42:22,639 --> 01:42:24,229
at you know at that atomic level um
and and also i mean there's there's

5640
01:42:24,229 --> 01:42:24,239
and and also i mean there's there's
 

5641
01:42:24,239 --> 01:42:26,310
and and also i mean there's there's
obviously that

5642
01:42:26,310 --> 01:42:26,320
obviously that
 

5643
01:42:26,320 --> 01:42:28,390
obviously that
we are maybe inclined to try to think of

5644
01:42:28,390 --> 01:42:28,400
we are maybe inclined to try to think of
 

5645
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:30,550
we are maybe inclined to try to think of
neural networks as like the brain but

5646
01:42:30,550 --> 01:42:30,560
neural networks as like the brain but
 

5647
01:42:30,560 --> 01:42:32,149
neural networks as like the brain but
the complexities

5648
01:42:32,149 --> 01:42:32,159
the complexities
 

5649
01:42:32,159 --> 01:42:34,950
the complexities
and the amount of magic that it feels

5650
01:42:34,950 --> 01:42:34,960
and the amount of magic that it feels
 

5651
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:37,109
and the amount of magic that it feels
when i mean i don't i'm not an expert so

5652
01:42:37,109 --> 01:42:37,119
when i mean i don't i'm not an expert so
 

5653
01:42:37,119 --> 01:42:38,870
when i mean i don't i'm not an expert so
it naturally feels more magic but

5654
01:42:38,870 --> 01:42:38,880
it naturally feels more magic but
 

5655
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:41,270
it naturally feels more magic but
looking at biological systems as opposed

5656
01:42:41,270 --> 01:42:41,280
looking at biological systems as opposed
 

5657
01:42:41,280 --> 01:42:43,990
looking at biological systems as opposed

01:42:46,639 --> 01:42:49,109
computational brains
just makes me like wow this there's such

5662
01:42:49,109 --> 01:42:49,119
just makes me like wow this there's such
 

5663
01:42:49,119 --> 01:42:51,109
just makes me like wow this there's such
level of complexity different still

5664
01:42:51,109 --> 01:42:51,119
level of complexity different still
 

5665
01:42:51,119 --> 01:42:52,629
level of complexity different still
right like orders of magnitude

5666
01:42:52,629 --> 01:42:52,639
right like orders of magnitude
 

5667
01:42:52,639 --> 01:42:54,790
right like orders of magnitude
complexity that um

5668
01:42:54,790 --> 01:42:54,800
complexity that um
 

5669
01:42:54,800 --> 01:42:56,550
complexity that um
sure these weights i mean we train them

5670
01:42:56,550 --> 01:42:56,560
sure these weights i mean we train them
 

5671
01:42:56,560 --> 01:42:58,709
sure these weights i mean we train them
and they do nice things but they're not

5672
01:42:58,709 --> 01:42:58,719
and they do nice things but they're not
 

5673
01:42:58,719 --> 01:42:59,990
and they do nice things but they're not
at the level

01:42:59,990 --> 01:43:00,000
at the level

01:43:08,229 --> 01:43:08,239
it just feels like it's just not
 

5683
01:43:08,239 --> 01:43:10,390
it just feels like it's just not
possible to achieve the same level of

to other beings is certainly shaped by
 

5691
01:43:18,239 --> 01:43:21,270
to other beings is certainly shaped by
this amazement of biology that maybe

01:43:21,270 --> 01:43:21,280
this amazement of biology that maybe
 

5693
01:43:21,280 --> 01:43:22,709
this amazement of biology that maybe
because i know too much i don't have

5694
01:43:22,709 --> 01:43:22,719
because i know too much i don't have
 

5695
01:43:22,719 --> 01:43:24,870
because i know too much i don't have
about machine learning but i certainly

5696
01:43:24,870 --> 01:43:24,880
about machine learning but i certainly
 

5697
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:27,030
about machine learning but i certainly
feel it's very far

5698
01:43:27,030 --> 01:43:27,040
feel it's very far
 

5699
01:43:27,040 --> 01:43:28,950
feel it's very far
fetched and far in the future to be

5700
01:43:28,950 --> 01:43:28,960

mathematical function that is

5706
01:43:34,709 --> 01:43:34,719
mathematical function that is
 

5707
01:43:34,719 --> 01:43:37,990
mathematical function that is
differentiable is is um is in fact

01:43:37,990 --> 01:43:38,000
differentiable is is um is in fact
 

5709
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:39,590
differentiable is is um is in fact
sentient and so on so there's something

5710
01:43:39,590 --> 01:43:39,600
sentient and so on so there's something
 

5711
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:42,070
sentient and so on so there's something
on that point it's very interesting so

5712
01:43:42,070 --> 01:43:42,080
on that point it's very interesting so
 

5713
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:43,910
on that point it's very interesting so
you know enough

5714
01:43:43,910 --> 01:43:43,920
you know enough
 

5715
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:46,870
you know enough
about machines and enough about biology

5716
01:43:46,870 --> 01:43:46,880
about machines and enough about biology
 

5717
01:43:46,880 --> 01:43:48,310
about machines and enough about biology
to know that there's many orders of

5718
01:43:48,310 --> 01:43:48,320
to know that there's many orders of
 

5719
01:43:48,320 --> 01:43:50,830
to know that there's many orders of
magnitude of difference in

5720
01:43:50,830 --> 01:43:50,840
magnitude of difference in
 

5721
01:43:50,840 --> 01:43:53,030
magnitude of difference in
complexity but

5722
01:43:53,030 --> 01:43:53,040
complexity but
 

5723
01:43:53,040 --> 01:43:55,910
complexity but
you know how machine learning works

5724
01:43:55,910 --> 01:43:55,920
you know how machine learning works
 

5725
01:43:55,920 --> 01:43:57,590
you know how machine learning works
so the interesting question from human

5726
01:43:57,590 --> 01:43:57,600
so the interesting question from human
 

5727
01:43:57,600 --> 01:43:58,950
so the interesting question from human
beings that are interacting with the

5728
01:43:58,950 --> 01:43:58,960
beings that are interacting with the
 

5729
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:00,229
beings that are interacting with the
system that don't know about the

5730
01:44:00,229 --> 01:44:00,239
system that don't know about the
 

5731
01:44:00,239 --> 01:44:02,149
system that don't know about the
underlying complexity

5732
01:44:02,149 --> 01:44:02,159
underlying complexity
 

5733
01:44:02,159 --> 01:44:04,629
underlying complexity
and i've seen people probably including

5734
01:44:04,629 --> 01:44:04,639
and i've seen people probably including
 

5735
01:44:04,639 --> 01:44:06,149
and i've seen people probably including
myself that have fallen in love with

5736
01:44:06,149 --> 01:44:06,159
myself that have fallen in love with
 

5737
01:44:06,159 --> 01:44:07,750
myself that have fallen in love with
things that are quite simple

5738
01:44:07,750 --> 01:44:07,760
things that are quite simple
 

5739
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:10,149
things that are quite simple
yeah so and and so maybe the complexity

5740
01:44:10,149 --> 01:44:10,159
yeah so and and so maybe the complexity
 

5741
01:44:10,159 --> 01:44:11,910
yeah so and and so maybe the complexity
is one part of the picture but maybe

5742
01:44:11,910 --> 01:44:11,920
is one part of the picture but maybe
 

5743
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:14,149
is one part of the picture but maybe
that's not a necessary

5744
01:44:14,149 --> 01:44:14,159
that's not a necessary
 

5745
01:44:14,159 --> 01:44:15,750
that's not a necessary
um

5746
01:44:15,750 --> 01:44:15,760
um
 

5747
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:17,990
um
that's not a necessary condition for

5748
01:44:17,990 --> 01:44:18,000
that's not a necessary condition for
 

5749
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:22,310
that's not a necessary condition for
sentience for um perception

5750
01:44:22,310 --> 01:44:22,320
sentience for um perception
 

5751
01:44:22,320 --> 01:44:25,430
sentience for um perception
uh or emulation of sentience right so i

5752
01:44:25,430 --> 01:44:25,440
uh or emulation of sentience right so i
 

5753
01:44:25,440 --> 01:44:27,990
uh or emulation of sentience right so i
mean i guess the other side of this is

5754
01:44:27,990 --> 01:44:28,000
mean i guess the other side of this is
 

5755
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:29,750
mean i guess the other side of this is
that's how i feel personally i mean you

5756
01:44:29,750 --> 01:44:29,760
that's how i feel personally i mean you
 

5757
01:44:29,760 --> 01:44:32,550
that's how i feel personally i mean you
asked me about the person right um now

5758
01:44:32,550 --> 01:44:32,560
asked me about the person right um now
 

5759
01:44:32,560 --> 01:44:34,390
asked me about the person right um now
it's very interesting to see how other

5760
01:44:34,390 --> 01:44:34,400
it's very interesting to see how other
 

5761
01:44:34,400 --> 01:44:36,629
it's very interesting to see how other
humans feel about things right this is

5762
01:44:36,629 --> 01:44:36,639
humans feel about things right this is
 

5763
01:44:36,639 --> 01:44:39,750
humans feel about things right this is
this we are like um again like i'm i'm

5764
01:44:39,750 --> 01:44:39,760
this we are like um again like i'm i'm
 

5765
01:44:39,760 --> 01:44:41,910
this we are like um again like i'm i'm
not as amazed about things that i feel

5766
01:44:41,910 --> 01:44:41,920
not as amazed about things that i feel
 

5767
01:44:41,920 --> 01:44:43,590
not as amazed about things that i feel
like this is not as magical as this

5768
01:44:43,590 --> 01:44:43,600
like this is not as magical as this
 

5769
01:44:43,600 --> 01:44:45,990
like this is not as magical as this
other thing because of maybe yeah how i

5770
01:44:45,990 --> 01:44:46,000
other thing because of maybe yeah how i
 

5771
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:49,189
other thing because of maybe yeah how i
got to learn about it and how i see the

5772
01:44:49,189 --> 01:44:49,199
got to learn about it and how i see the
 

5773
01:44:49,199 --> 01:44:51,030
got to learn about it and how i see the
curve a bit more smooth because i you

5774
01:44:51,030 --> 01:44:51,040
curve a bit more smooth because i you
 

5775
01:44:51,040 --> 01:44:53,109
curve a bit more smooth because i you
know like just seen the progress of

5776
01:44:53,109 --> 01:44:53,119
know like just seen the progress of
 

5777
01:44:53,119 --> 01:44:55,910
know like just seen the progress of
language models since shannon in the 50s

5778
01:44:55,910 --> 01:44:55,920
language models since shannon in the 50s
 

5779
01:44:55,920 --> 01:44:56,550
language models since shannon in the 50s
and

5780
01:44:56,550 --> 01:44:56,560
and
 

5781
01:44:56,560 --> 01:44:58,790
and
actually looking at that time scale

5782
01:44:58,790 --> 01:44:58,800
actually looking at that time scale
 

5783
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:00,790
actually looking at that time scale
we're not that fast progress right i

5784
01:45:00,790 --> 01:45:00,800
we're not that fast progress right i
 

5785
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:02,950
we're not that fast progress right i
mean it's what what we were thinking at

5786
01:45:02,950 --> 01:45:02,960
mean it's what what we were thinking at
 

5787
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:05,990
mean it's what what we were thinking at
the time like almost 100 years ago

5788
01:45:05,990 --> 01:45:06,000
the time like almost 100 years ago
 

5789
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:07,910
the time like almost 100 years ago
is not that dissimilar to what we're

5790
01:45:07,910 --> 01:45:07,920
is not that dissimilar to what we're
 

5791
01:45:07,920 --> 01:45:10,390
is not that dissimilar to what we're
doing now but at the same time yeah

5792
01:45:10,390 --> 01:45:10,400
doing now but at the same time yeah
 

5793
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:12,470
doing now but at the same time yeah
obviously others my experience right

5794
01:45:12,470 --> 01:45:12,480
obviously others my experience right
 

5795
01:45:12,480 --> 01:45:14,390
obviously others my experience right
that the personal experience

5796
01:45:14,390 --> 01:45:14,400
that the personal experience
 

5797
01:45:14,400 --> 01:45:17,350
that the personal experience
i think no one should um you know i

5798
01:45:17,350 --> 01:45:17,360
i think no one should um you know i
 

5799
01:45:17,360 --> 01:45:18,629
i think no one should um you know i
think no one should

5800
01:45:18,629 --> 01:45:18,639
think no one should
 

5801
01:45:18,639 --> 01:45:20,149
think no one should
should should tell others how they

5802
01:45:20,149 --> 01:45:20,159
should should tell others how they
 

5803
01:45:20,159 --> 01:45:22,149
should should tell others how they
should feel i mean the feelings are very

5804
01:45:22,149 --> 01:45:22,159
should feel i mean the feelings are very
 

5805
01:45:22,159 --> 01:45:24,310
should feel i mean the feelings are very
personal right so how others might feel

5806
01:45:24,310 --> 01:45:24,320
personal right so how others might feel
 

5807
01:45:24,320 --> 01:45:26,790
personal right so how others might feel
about the models and so on that's one

5808
01:45:26,790 --> 01:45:26,800
about the models and so on that's one
 

5809
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:28,790
about the models and so on that's one
part of the story that is important to

5810
01:45:28,790 --> 01:45:28,800
part of the story that is important to
 

5811
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:30,950
part of the story that is important to
understand for me personally as a

5812
01:45:30,950 --> 01:45:30,960
understand for me personally as a
 

5813
01:45:30,960 --> 01:45:33,189
understand for me personally as a
researcher and then

5814
01:45:33,189 --> 01:45:33,199
researcher and then
 

5815
01:45:33,199 --> 01:45:35,510
researcher and then
when i maybe disagree or i don't

5816
01:45:35,510 --> 01:45:35,520
when i maybe disagree or i don't
 

5817
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:37,590
when i maybe disagree or i don't
understand or see that yeah maybe this

5818
01:45:37,590 --> 01:45:37,600
understand or see that yeah maybe this
 

5819
01:45:37,600 --> 01:45:39,189
understand or see that yeah maybe this
this is not something i think right now

5820
01:45:39,189 --> 01:45:39,199
this is not something i think right now
 

5821
01:45:39,199 --> 01:45:41,510
this is not something i think right now
is reasonable knowing all that i know

5822
01:45:41,510 --> 01:45:41,520
is reasonable knowing all that i know
 

5823
01:45:41,520 --> 01:45:43,750
is reasonable knowing all that i know
one of the other things and perhaps

5824
01:45:43,750 --> 01:45:43,760
one of the other things and perhaps
 

5825
01:45:43,760 --> 01:45:45,910
one of the other things and perhaps
partly why it's great to be talking to

5826
01:45:45,910 --> 01:45:45,920
partly why it's great to be talking to
 

5827
01:45:45,920 --> 01:45:48,390
partly why it's great to be talking to
you and reaching out to the world about

5828
01:45:48,390 --> 01:45:48,400
you and reaching out to the world about
 

5829
01:45:48,400 --> 01:45:50,790
you and reaching out to the world about
machine learning is hey

5830
01:45:50,790 --> 01:45:50,800
machine learning is hey
 

5831
01:45:50,800 --> 01:45:52,950
machine learning is hey
let's make let's demystify a bit the

5832
01:45:52,950 --> 01:45:52,960
let's make let's demystify a bit the
 

5833
01:45:52,960 --> 01:45:55,669
let's make let's demystify a bit the
magic and try to see a bit more of the

5834
01:45:55,669 --> 01:45:55,679
magic and try to see a bit more of the
 

5835
01:45:55,679 --> 01:45:58,629
magic and try to see a bit more of the
math and the fact that literally to

5836
01:45:58,629 --> 01:45:58,639
math and the fact that literally to
 

5837
01:45:58,639 --> 01:46:00,950
math and the fact that literally to
create these models if we had the right

5838
01:46:00,950 --> 01:46:00,960
create these models if we had the right
 

5839
01:46:00,960 --> 01:46:03,510
create these models if we had the right
software it would be 10 lines of code um

5840
01:46:03,510 --> 01:46:03,520
software it would be 10 lines of code um
 

5841
01:46:03,520 --> 01:46:06,709
software it would be 10 lines of code um
and then just a dump of the internet so

5842
01:46:06,709 --> 01:46:06,719
and then just a dump of the internet so
 

5843
01:46:06,719 --> 01:46:08,870
and then just a dump of the internet so
versus like then the complexity of like

5844
01:46:08,870 --> 01:46:08,880
versus like then the complexity of like
 

5845
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:09,669
versus like then the complexity of like
the

5846
01:46:09,669 --> 01:46:09,679
the
 

5847
01:46:09,679 --> 01:46:12,550
the
creation of humans um from from their

5848
01:46:12,550 --> 01:46:12,560
creation of humans um from from their
 

5849
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:14,870
creation of humans um from from their
inception right and also the complexity

5850
01:46:14,870 --> 01:46:14,880
inception right and also the complexity
 

5851
01:46:14,880 --> 01:46:17,750
inception right and also the complexity
of evolution of the whole universe to

5852
01:46:17,750 --> 01:46:17,760
of evolution of the whole universe to
 

5853
01:46:17,760 --> 01:46:20,470
of evolution of the whole universe to
where we are um that is feels orders of

5854
01:46:20,470 --> 01:46:20,480
where we are um that is feels orders of
 

5855
01:46:20,480 --> 01:46:22,629
where we are um that is feels orders of
magnitude more complex and fascinating

5856
01:46:22,629 --> 01:46:22,639
magnitude more complex and fascinating
 

5857
01:46:22,639 --> 01:46:24,790
magnitude more complex and fascinating
to me so i think

5858
01:46:24,790 --> 01:46:24,800
to me so i think
 

5859
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:26,870
to me so i think
yeah maybe part of the only thing i'm

5860
01:46:26,870 --> 01:46:26,880
yeah maybe part of the only thing i'm
 

5861
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:28,390
yeah maybe part of the only thing i'm
thinking about

5862
01:46:28,390 --> 01:46:28,400
thinking about
 

5863
01:46:28,400 --> 01:46:30,229
thinking about
trying to tell you is yeah i i think

5864
01:46:30,229 --> 01:46:30,239
trying to tell you is yeah i i think
 

5865
01:46:30,239 --> 01:46:32,790
trying to tell you is yeah i i think
explaining a bit of the magic there is a

5866
01:46:32,790 --> 01:46:32,800
explaining a bit of the magic there is a
 

5867
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:34,709
explaining a bit of the magic there is a
bit of magic it's good to be in love

5868
01:46:34,709 --> 01:46:34,719
bit of magic it's good to be in love
 

5869
01:46:34,719 --> 01:46:37,030
bit of magic it's good to be in love
obviously with what you do at work and

5870
01:46:37,030 --> 01:46:37,040
obviously with what you do at work and
 

5871
01:46:37,040 --> 01:46:39,350
obviously with what you do at work and
i'm certainly fascinated and surprised

5872
01:46:39,350 --> 01:46:39,360
i'm certainly fascinated and surprised
 

5873
01:46:39,360 --> 01:46:42,149
i'm certainly fascinated and surprised
quite quite often as well but i think

5874
01:46:42,149 --> 01:46:42,159
quite quite often as well but i think
 

5875
01:46:42,159 --> 01:46:43,910
quite quite often as well but i think
hopefully as

5876
01:46:43,910 --> 01:46:43,920
hopefully as
 

5877
01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:45,590
hopefully as
experts in biology hopefully will tell

5878
01:46:45,590 --> 01:46:45,600
experts in biology hopefully will tell
 

5879
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:47,910
experts in biology hopefully will tell
me this is not as magic and i'm happy to

5880
01:46:47,910 --> 01:46:47,920
me this is not as magic and i'm happy to
 

5881
01:46:47,920 --> 01:46:50,149
me this is not as magic and i'm happy to
learn that um through through

5882
01:46:50,149 --> 01:46:50,159
learn that um through through
 

5883
01:46:50,159 --> 01:46:52,149
learn that um through through
interactions with the larger community

5884
01:46:52,149 --> 01:46:52,159
interactions with the larger community
 

5885
01:46:52,159 --> 01:46:53,270
interactions with the larger community
we can

5886
01:46:53,270 --> 01:46:53,280
we can
 

5887
01:46:53,280 --> 01:46:55,910
we can
also have a certain level of education

5888
01:46:55,910 --> 01:46:55,920
also have a certain level of education
 

5889
01:46:55,920 --> 01:46:56,870
also have a certain level of education
that

5890
01:46:56,870 --> 01:46:56,880
that
 

5891
01:46:56,880 --> 01:46:58,629
that
in practice also will matter because i

5892
01:46:58,629 --> 01:46:58,639
in practice also will matter because i
 

5893
01:46:58,639 --> 01:47:00,390
in practice also will matter because i
mean one question is how you feel about

5894
01:47:00,390 --> 01:47:00,400
mean one question is how you feel about
 

5895
01:47:00,400 --> 01:47:02,229
mean one question is how you feel about
this but then the other very important

5896
01:47:02,229 --> 01:47:02,239
this but then the other very important
 

5897
01:47:02,239 --> 01:47:02,950
this but then the other very important
is

5898
01:47:02,950 --> 01:47:02,960
is
 

5899
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:05,030
is
you starting to interact with this in

5900
01:47:05,030 --> 01:47:05,040
you starting to interact with this in
 

5901
01:47:05,040 --> 01:47:07,510
you starting to interact with this in
products and so on um it's good to

5902
01:47:07,510 --> 01:47:07,520
products and so on um it's good to
 

5903
01:47:07,520 --> 01:47:09,270
products and so on um it's good to
understand a bit what's going on what's

5904
01:47:09,270 --> 01:47:09,280
understand a bit what's going on what's
 

5905
01:47:09,280 --> 01:47:11,830
understand a bit what's going on what's
not going on and what's safe what's not

5906
01:47:11,830 --> 01:47:11,840
not going on and what's safe what's not
 

5907
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:13,990
not going on and what's safe what's not
safe and so on right otherwise um the

5908
01:47:13,990 --> 01:47:14,000
safe and so on right otherwise um the
 

5909
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,629
safe and so on right otherwise um the
technology will not be used properly for

5910
01:47:16,629 --> 01:47:16,639
technology will not be used properly for
 

5911
01:47:16,639 --> 01:47:18,790
technology will not be used properly for
good which is obviously the goal of all

5912
01:47:18,790 --> 01:47:18,800
good which is obviously the goal of all
 

5913
01:47:18,800 --> 01:47:20,470
good which is obviously the goal of all
of us i hope

5914
01:47:20,470 --> 01:47:20,480
of us i hope
 

5915
01:47:20,480 --> 01:47:22,950
of us i hope
so let me then ask the next question do

5916
01:47:22,950 --> 01:47:22,960
so let me then ask the next question do
 

5917
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:25,669
so let me then ask the next question do
you think in order to solve intelligence

5918
01:47:25,669 --> 01:47:25,679
you think in order to solve intelligence
 

5919
01:47:25,679 --> 01:47:28,229
you think in order to solve intelligence
or to do to replace the lex bot that

5920
01:47:28,229 --> 01:47:28,239
or to do to replace the lex bot that
 

5921
01:47:28,239 --> 01:47:30,470
or to do to replace the lex bot that
does interviews as we started this

5922
01:47:30,470 --> 01:47:30,480
does interviews as we started this
 

5923
01:47:30,480 --> 01:47:32,550
does interviews as we started this
conversation with do you think

5924
01:47:32,550 --> 01:47:32,560
conversation with do you think
 

5925
01:47:32,560 --> 01:47:34,229
conversation with do you think
the system needs to be

5926
01:47:34,229 --> 01:47:34,239
the system needs to be
 

5927
01:47:34,239 --> 01:47:35,750
the system needs to be
sentient do you think he needs to

5928
01:47:35,750 --> 01:47:35,760
sentient do you think he needs to
 

5929
01:47:35,760 --> 01:47:37,189
sentient do you think he needs to
achieve something

5930
01:47:37,189 --> 01:47:37,199
achieve something
 

5931
01:47:37,199 --> 01:47:39,350
achieve something
like consciousness and do you think

5932
01:47:39,350 --> 01:47:39,360
like consciousness and do you think
 

5933
01:47:39,360 --> 01:47:42,229
like consciousness and do you think
about what consciousness is in the human

5934
01:47:42,229 --> 01:47:42,239
about what consciousness is in the human
 

5935
01:47:42,239 --> 01:47:43,109
about what consciousness is in the human
mind

5936
01:47:43,109 --> 01:47:43,119
mind
 

5937
01:47:43,119 --> 01:47:44,870
mind
that could be instructive for creating

5938
01:47:44,870 --> 01:47:44,880
that could be instructive for creating
 

5939
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:46,629
that could be instructive for creating
ai systems

5940
01:47:46,629 --> 01:47:46,639
ai systems
 

5941
01:47:46,639 --> 01:47:47,590
ai systems
yeah

5942
01:47:47,590 --> 01:47:47,600
yeah
 

5943
01:47:47,600 --> 01:47:50,950
yeah
honestly i think probably not

5944
01:47:50,950 --> 01:47:50,960
honestly i think probably not
 

5945
01:47:50,960 --> 01:47:54,790
honestly i think probably not
to to the degree of intelligence that

5946
01:47:54,790 --> 01:47:54,800
to to the degree of intelligence that
 

5947
01:47:54,800 --> 01:47:55,830
to to the degree of intelligence that
there's

5948
01:47:55,830 --> 01:47:55,840
there's
 

5949
01:47:55,840 --> 01:47:57,750
there's
this brain that

5950
01:47:57,750 --> 01:47:57,760
this brain that
 

5951
01:47:57,760 --> 01:48:00,470
this brain that
can learn can be extremely useful can

5952
01:48:00,470 --> 01:48:00,480
can learn can be extremely useful can
 

5953
01:48:00,480 --> 01:48:02,390
can learn can be extremely useful can
challenge you can teach you

5954
01:48:02,390 --> 01:48:02,400
challenge you can teach you
 

5955
01:48:02,400 --> 01:48:04,390
challenge you can teach you
um converse you can teach

these insights
 

5989
01:48:34,719 --> 01:48:36,870
these insights
are very important right so there's a

01:48:36,870 --> 01:48:36,880
are very important right so there's a
 

5991
01:48:36,880 --> 01:48:38,310
are very important right so there's a

computation um i think

5998
01:48:44,070 --> 01:48:44,080
computation um i think
 

5999
01:48:44,080 --> 01:48:46,470

my understanding is sure there's neurons
 

6001
01:48:46,480 --> 01:48:47,910
my understanding is sure there's neurons
and there's some resemblance to neural

and there's some resemblance to neural
 

6003
01:48:47,920 --> 01:48:50,310
and there's some resemblance to neural
networks but we don't quite understand

6004
01:48:50,310 --> 01:48:50,320
networks but we don't quite understand
 

6005
01:48:50,320 --> 01:48:52,870
networks but we don't quite understand
enough of the brain in detail right to

6006
01:48:52,870 --> 01:48:52,880
enough of the brain in detail right to
 

6007
01:48:52,880 --> 01:48:56,149
enough of the brain in detail right to
to be able to replicate it but then

6008
01:48:56,149 --> 01:48:56,159
to be able to replicate it but then
 

6009
01:48:56,159 --> 01:48:56,950
to be able to replicate it but then
more

6010
01:48:56,950 --> 01:48:56,960
more

01:48:56,960 --> 01:49:00,229
more
if you if you zoom out a bit how we then

6012
01:49:00,229 --> 01:49:00,239
if you if you zoom out a bit how we then
 

6013
01:49:00,239 --> 01:49:03,270

our thought process how memory works um
 

6015
01:49:03,280 --> 01:49:05,510
our thought process how memory works um
maybe even how evolution got us here

6016
01:49:05,510 --> 01:49:05,520
maybe even how evolution got us here
 

6017
01:49:05,520 --> 01:49:07,430
maybe even how evolution got us here
what's exploration exploitation like all

6018
01:49:07,430 --> 01:49:07,440
what's exploration exploitation like all
 

6019
01:49:07,440 --> 01:49:09,270
what's exploration exploitation like all
the how these things happen i think this

6020
01:49:09,270 --> 01:49:09,280
the how these things happen i think this
 

6021
01:49:09,280 --> 01:49:11,990
the how these things happen i think this
clearly can inform algorithmic level

6044
01:49:37,430 --> 01:49:37,440
the chain hopefully but
 

6045
01:49:37,440 --> 01:49:39,669

but consciousness in particular i don't

6046
01:49:39,669 --> 01:49:39,679
but consciousness in particular i don't
 

6047
01:49:39,679 --> 01:49:41,910
but consciousness in particular i don't
i don't myself at least think too hard

6048
01:49:41,910 --> 01:49:41,920
i don't myself at least think too hard
 

6049
01:49:41,920 --> 01:49:42,870
i don't myself at least think too hard
about

6050
01:49:42,870 --> 01:49:42,880
about
 

6051
01:49:42,880 --> 01:49:44,870
about
how to add that to to the system but

6052
01:49:44,870 --> 01:49:44,880
how to add that to to the system but
 

6053
01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:47,109
how to add that to to the system but
maybe maybe my understanding is also

6054
01:49:47,109 --> 01:49:47,119
maybe maybe my understanding is also
 

6055
01:49:47,119 --> 01:49:48,709
maybe maybe my understanding is also
very personal about what it means right

6056
01:49:48,709 --> 01:49:48,719
very personal about what it means right
 

6057
01:49:48,719 --> 01:49:50,870
very personal about what it means right
i think this even even that in itself is

6058
01:49:50,870 --> 01:49:50,880
i think this even even that in itself is
 

6059
01:49:50,880 --> 01:49:53,270
i think this even even that in itself is
a long debate that i know people uh

6060
01:49:53,270 --> 01:49:53,280
a long debate that i know people uh
 

6061
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:55,189
a long debate that i know people uh
people have often

6062
01:49:55,189 --> 01:49:55,199
people have often
 

6063
01:49:55,199 --> 01:49:57,669
people have often
and maybe i should learn more about this

6064
01:49:57,669 --> 01:49:57,679
and maybe i should learn more about this
 

6065
01:49:57,679 --> 01:49:59,669
and maybe i should learn more about this
yeah and i personally

6066
01:49:59,669 --> 01:49:59,679
yeah and i personally
 

6067
01:49:59,679 --> 01:50:02,310
yeah and i personally
i notice the magic often on a personal

6068
01:50:02,310 --> 01:50:02,320
i notice the magic often on a personal
 

6069
01:50:02,320 --> 01:50:04,790
i notice the magic often on a personal
level especially with physical systems

anthropomorphization
 

6083
01:50:18,480 --> 01:50:20,149
anthropomorphization
and you notice the magic and you start

6084
01:50:20,149 --> 01:50:20,159
and you notice the magic and you start
 

6085
01:50:20,159 --> 01:50:22,830
and you notice the magic and you start
to think about things like sanctions

6086
01:50:22,830 --> 01:50:22,840
to think about things like sanctions
 

6087
01:50:22,840 --> 01:50:25,189
to think about things like sanctions
that has to do more with effective

kind of dramatic things
 

6093
01:50:28,560 --> 01:50:29,990
kind of dramatic things
it um

6094
01:50:29,990 --> 01:50:30,000

6095
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:31,350

it seems like a useful part of

6103
01:50:36,480 --> 01:50:38,870

seems like useful for us humans we we

6104
01:50:38,870 --> 01:50:38,880
seems like useful for us humans we we
 

6105
01:50:38,880 --> 01:50:41,109
seems like useful for us humans we we
treat each other more seriously we are

treat each other more seriously we are
 

6107
01:50:41,119 --> 01:50:44,550
treat each other more seriously we are

6112
01:50:48,950 --> 01:50:48,960
correctly all that kind of stuff seems
 

6113
01:50:48,960 --> 01:50:51,270
correctly all that kind of stuff seems
useful at least to fake it even if you

6114
01:50:51,270 --> 01:50:51,280
useful at least to fake it even if you
 

6115
01:50:51,280 --> 01:50:53,910
useful at least to fake it even if you
never make it so maybe like yeah

6116
01:50:53,910 --> 01:50:53,920
never make it so maybe like yeah

and since you talk to a few people do

6120
01:50:57,189 --> 01:50:57,199
and since you talk to a few people do
 

6121
01:50:57,199 --> 01:50:59,270
and since you talk to a few people do
you then you do think that

6122
01:50:59,270 --> 01:50:59,280
you then you do think that
 

6123
01:50:59,280 --> 01:51:01,669
you then you do think that
we'll need to figure something out

6124
01:51:01,669 --> 01:51:01,679
we'll need to figure something out
 

6125
01:51:01,679 --> 01:51:03,750
we'll need to figure something out
in order to achieve

6126
01:51:03,750 --> 01:51:03,760
in order to achieve
 

6127
01:51:03,760 --> 01:51:05,910
in order to achieve
intelligence in a grander sense of the

6128
01:51:05,910 --> 01:51:05,920
intelligence in a grander sense of the
 

6129
01:51:05,920 --> 01:51:08,070
intelligence in a grander sense of the
world yeah i i personally believe yes

6130
01:51:08,070 --> 01:51:08,080
world yeah i i personally believe yes
 

6131
01:51:08,080 --> 01:51:11,270
world yeah i i personally believe yes
but i don't even think it'll be like a

6132
01:51:11,270 --> 01:51:11,280
but i don't even think it'll be like a
 

6133
01:51:11,280 --> 01:51:14,070
but i don't even think it'll be like a
separate island we'll have to travel to

6134
01:51:14,070 --> 01:51:14,080
separate island we'll have to travel to
 

6135
01:51:14,080 --> 01:51:15,430
separate island we'll have to travel to
i think it will emerge very quite

6136
01:51:15,430 --> 01:51:15,440
i think it will emerge very quite
 

6137
01:51:15,440 --> 01:51:18,790
i think it will emerge very quite
naturally okay that's easier than for us

6138
01:51:18,790 --> 01:51:18,800
naturally okay that's easier than for us
 

6139
01:51:18,800 --> 01:51:21,589
naturally okay that's easier than for us
then thank you but the reason i think

6140
01:51:21,589 --> 01:51:21,599
then thank you but the reason i think
 

6141
01:51:21,599 --> 01:51:23,270
then thank you but the reason i think
it's important to think about is you

6142
01:51:23,270 --> 01:51:23,280
it's important to think about is you
 

6143
01:51:23,280 --> 01:51:25,430
it's important to think about is you
will start i believe like with this

6144
01:51:25,430 --> 01:51:25,440
will start i believe like with this
 

6145
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:27,270
will start i believe like with this
google engineer you'll start seeing this

6146
01:51:27,270 --> 01:51:27,280
google engineer you'll start seeing this
 

6147
01:51:27,280 --> 01:51:29,990
google engineer you'll start seeing this
a lot more especially when you have ai

6148
01:51:29,990 --> 01:51:30,000
a lot more especially when you have ai
 

6149
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:31,510
a lot more especially when you have ai
systems that are actually interacting

6150
01:51:31,510 --> 01:51:31,520
systems that are actually interacting
 

6151
01:51:31,520 --> 01:51:33,430
systems that are actually interacting
with human beings that don't have an

6152
01:51:33,430 --> 01:51:33,440
with human beings that don't have an
 

6153
01:51:33,440 --> 01:51:35,109
with human beings that don't have an
engineering background

6154
01:51:35,109 --> 01:51:35,119
engineering background
 

6155
01:51:35,119 --> 01:51:38,390
engineering background
and we have to prepare for that

6156
01:51:38,390 --> 01:51:38,400
and we have to prepare for that
 

6157
01:51:38,400 --> 01:51:40,070
and we have to prepare for that
because there will be i do believe there

6158
01:51:40,070 --> 01:51:40,080
because there will be i do believe there
 

6159
01:51:40,080 --> 01:51:41,589
because there will be i do believe there
will be a civil rights movement for

6160
01:51:41,589 --> 01:51:41,599
will be a civil rights movement for
 

6161
01:51:41,599 --> 01:51:44,390
will be a civil rights movement for
robots as silly as as it is to say

6162
01:51:44,390 --> 01:51:44,400
robots as silly as as it is to say
 

6163
01:51:44,400 --> 01:51:46,390
robots as silly as as it is to say
there's going to be a large number of

6164
01:51:46,390 --> 01:51:46,400
there's going to be a large number of
 

6165
01:51:46,400 --> 01:51:47,830
there's going to be a large number of
people that realize there's these

6166
01:51:47,830 --> 01:51:47,840
people that realize there's these
 

6167
01:51:47,840 --> 01:51:50,470
people that realize there's these
intelligent entities with whom i have a

6168
01:51:50,470 --> 01:51:50,480
intelligent entities with whom i have a
 

6169
01:51:50,480 --> 01:51:52,229
intelligent entities with whom i have a
deep relationship and i don't want to

6170
01:51:52,229 --> 01:51:52,239
deep relationship and i don't want to
 

6171
01:51:52,239 --> 01:51:54,229
deep relationship and i don't want to
lose them they've come to be a part of

6172
01:51:54,229 --> 01:51:54,239
lose them they've come to be a part of
 

6173
01:51:54,239 --> 01:51:56,310
lose them they've come to be a part of
my life and they mean a lot they have a

6174
01:51:56,310 --> 01:51:56,320
my life and they mean a lot they have a
 

6175
01:51:56,320 --> 01:51:58,310
my life and they mean a lot they have a
name they have a story they have a

6176
01:51:58,310 --> 01:51:58,320
name they have a story they have a
 

6177
01:51:58,320 --> 01:52:00,390
name they have a story they have a
memory and we start to ask questions

6178
01:52:00,390 --> 01:52:00,400
memory and we start to ask questions
 

6179
01:52:00,400 --> 01:52:02,390
memory and we start to ask questions
about ourselves well

6180
01:52:02,390 --> 01:52:02,400
about ourselves well
 

6181
01:52:02,400 --> 01:52:05,669
about ourselves well
what uh this thing sure seems like it's

6182
01:52:05,669 --> 01:52:05,679
what uh this thing sure seems like it's
 

6183
01:52:05,679 --> 01:52:07,510
what uh this thing sure seems like it's
capable of suffering

6184
01:52:07,510 --> 01:52:07,520
capable of suffering
 

6185
01:52:07,520 --> 01:52:09,270
capable of suffering
because it tells all these stories of

6186
01:52:09,270 --> 01:52:09,280
because it tells all these stories of
 

6187
01:52:09,280 --> 01:52:10,790
because it tells all these stories of
suffering it doesn't want to die and all

6188
01:52:10,790 --> 01:52:10,800
suffering it doesn't want to die and all
 

6189
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:12,470
suffering it doesn't want to die and all
those kinds of things and we have to

6190
01:52:12,470 --> 01:52:12,480
those kinds of things and we have to
 

6191
01:52:12,480 --> 01:52:14,870
those kinds of things and we have to
start to ask ourselves questions what is

6192
01:52:14,870 --> 01:52:14,880
start to ask ourselves questions what is
 

6193
01:52:14,880 --> 01:52:16,229
start to ask ourselves questions what is
the difference between a human being in

6194
01:52:16,229 --> 01:52:16,239
the difference between a human being in
 

6195
01:52:16,239 --> 01:52:18,470
the difference between a human being in
this thing and wait so when you engineer

6196
01:52:18,470 --> 01:52:18,480
this thing and wait so when you engineer
 

6197
01:52:18,480 --> 01:52:19,990
this thing and wait so when you engineer
i believe

6198
01:52:19,990 --> 01:52:20,000
i believe
 

6199
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:21,750
i believe
from an engineering perspective like a

6200
01:52:21,750 --> 01:52:21,760
from an engineering perspective like a
 

6201
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:24,790
from an engineering perspective like a
deep mind or anybody that builds systems

6202
01:52:24,790 --> 01:52:24,800
deep mind or anybody that builds systems
 

6203
01:52:24,800 --> 01:52:27,109
deep mind or anybody that builds systems
there might be laws in the future where

6204
01:52:27,109 --> 01:52:27,119
there might be laws in the future where
 

6205
01:52:27,119 --> 01:52:29,030
there might be laws in the future where
you're not allowed to engineer systems

6206
01:52:29,030 --> 01:52:29,040
you're not allowed to engineer systems
 

6207
01:52:29,040 --> 01:52:29,750
you're not allowed to engineer systems
with

6208
01:52:29,750 --> 01:52:29,760
with
 

6209
01:52:29,760 --> 01:52:32,070
with
displays of sentience

6210
01:52:32,070 --> 01:52:32,080
displays of sentience
 

6211
01:52:32,080 --> 01:52:33,589
displays of sentience
unless

6212
01:52:33,589 --> 01:52:33,599
unless
 

6213
01:52:33,599 --> 01:52:34,470
unless
they're

6214
01:52:34,470 --> 01:52:34,480
they're
 

6215
01:52:34,480 --> 01:52:36,229
they're
explicitly designed to be that unless

6216
01:52:36,229 --> 01:52:36,239
explicitly designed to be that unless
 

6217
01:52:36,239 --> 01:52:38,550
explicitly designed to be that unless
it's a pet so if you if you have a

6218
01:52:38,550 --> 01:52:38,560
it's a pet so if you if you have a
 

6219
01:52:38,560 --> 01:52:40,070
it's a pet so if you if you have a
system that's just doing customer

6220
01:52:40,070 --> 01:52:40,080
system that's just doing customer
 

6221

system that's just doing customer
support

6222
01:52:41,109 --> 01:52:41,119
support
 

6223
01:52:41,119 --> 01:52:43,350
support
you're legally not allowed to display

6224
01:52:43,350 --> 01:52:43,360
you're legally not allowed to display
 

6225
01:52:43,360 --> 01:52:45,510
you're legally not allowed to display
sentience we'll start to like ask

6226
01:52:45,510 --> 01:52:45,520
sentience we'll start to like ask
 

6227
01:52:45,520 --> 01:52:47,189
sentience we'll start to like ask
ourselves that question

6228
01:52:47,189 --> 01:52:47,199
ourselves that question
 

6229
01:52:47,199 --> 01:52:48,950
ourselves that question
and then so that that's that's going to

6230
01:52:48,950 --> 01:52:48,960
and then so that that's that's going to
 

6231
01:52:48,960 --> 01:52:50,310
and then so that that's that's going to
be part of the software engineering

6232
01:52:50,310 --> 01:52:50,320
be part of the software engineering
 

6233
01:52:50,320 --> 01:52:53,030
be part of the software engineering
process do we do we which features do we

6234
01:52:53,030 --> 01:52:53,040
process do we do we which features do we
 

6235
01:52:53,040 --> 01:52:54,790
process do we do we which features do we
have in one of them as

6236
01:52:54,790 --> 01:52:54,800
have in one of them as
 

6237
01:52:54,800 --> 01:52:57,109
have in one of them as
communications essentials but it's

6238
01:52:57,109 --> 01:52:57,119
communications essentials but it's
 

6239
01:52:57,119 --> 01:52:58,310
communications essentials but it's
important to start thinking about that

6240
01:52:58,310 --> 01:52:58,320
important to start thinking about that
 

6241
01:52:58,320 --> 01:53:00,149
important to start thinking about that
stuff especially how much it captivates

6242
01:53:00,149 --> 01:53:00,159
stuff especially how much it captivates
 

6243
01:53:00,159 --> 01:53:01,510
stuff especially how much it captivates
public attention

6244
01:53:01,510 --> 01:53:01,520
public attention
 

6245
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:03,270
public attention
yeah absolutely absolutely it's a it's

6246
01:53:03,270 --> 01:53:03,280
yeah absolutely absolutely it's a it's
 

6247
01:53:03,280 --> 01:53:05,430
yeah absolutely absolutely it's a it's
definitely a topic that

6248
01:53:05,430 --> 01:53:05,440
definitely a topic that
 

6249
01:53:05,440 --> 01:53:07,109
definitely a topic that
is important we

6250
01:53:07,109 --> 01:53:07,119
is important we
 

6251
01:53:07,119 --> 01:53:09,910
is important we
think about and i think in a way i i

6252
01:53:09,910 --> 01:53:09,920
think about and i think in a way i i
 

6253
01:53:09,920 --> 01:53:11,910
think about and i think in a way i i
always see not not i mean not not every

6254
01:53:11,910 --> 01:53:11,920
always see not not i mean not not every
 

6255
01:53:11,920 --> 01:53:14,550
always see not not i mean not not every
movie is is is equally

6256
01:53:14,550 --> 01:53:14,560
movie is is is equally
 

6257
01:53:14,560 --> 01:53:16,149
movie is is is equally
on point with certain things but

6258
01:53:16,149 --> 01:53:16,159
on point with certain things but
 

6259
01:53:16,159 --> 01:53:18,950
on point with certain things but
certainly science fiction in this sense

6260
01:53:18,950 --> 01:53:18,960
certainly science fiction in this sense
 

6261
01:53:18,960 --> 01:53:21,669
certainly science fiction in this sense
at least has prepared society to to

6262
01:53:21,669 --> 01:53:21,679
at least has prepared society to to
 

6263
01:53:21,679 --> 01:53:24,629
at least has prepared society to to
start thinking about certain topics that

6264
01:53:24,629 --> 01:53:24,639
start thinking about certain topics that
 

6265
01:53:24,639 --> 01:53:26,470
start thinking about certain topics that
even if it's too early to talk about as

6266
01:53:26,470 --> 01:53:26,480
even if it's too early to talk about as
 

6267
01:53:26,480 --> 01:53:29,750
even if it's too early to talk about as
long as we are like reasonable um it's

6268
01:53:29,750 --> 01:53:29,760
long as we are like reasonable um it's
 

6269
01:53:29,760 --> 01:53:32,709
long as we are like reasonable um it's
certainly gonna prepare us for for both

6270
01:53:32,709 --> 01:53:32,719
certainly gonna prepare us for for both
 

6271
01:53:32,719 --> 01:53:34,950
certainly gonna prepare us for for both
um the research to come and how to i

6272
01:53:34,950 --> 01:53:34,960
um the research to come and how to i
 

6273
01:53:34,960 --> 01:53:36,950
um the research to come and how to i
mean there's many important challenges

6274
01:53:36,950 --> 01:53:36,960
mean there's many important challenges
 

6275
01:53:36,960 --> 01:53:40,550
mean there's many important challenges
and and topics that um come with with

6276
01:53:40,550 --> 01:53:40,560
and and topics that um come with with
 

6277
01:53:40,560 --> 01:53:43,030
and and topics that um come with with
building an intelligent system many of

6278
01:53:43,030 --> 01:53:43,040
building an intelligent system many of
 

6279
01:53:43,040 --> 01:53:45,350
building an intelligent system many of
which you just mentioned right so

6280
01:53:45,350 --> 01:53:45,360
which you just mentioned right so
 

6281
01:53:45,360 --> 01:53:46,709
which you just mentioned right so
i think

6282
01:53:46,709 --> 01:53:46,719
i think
 

6283
01:53:46,719 --> 01:53:49,189
i think
being we're never going to be

6284
01:53:49,189 --> 01:53:49,199
being we're never going to be
 

6285
01:53:49,199 --> 01:53:51,270
being we're never going to be
fully ready unless we talk about this

6286
01:53:51,270 --> 01:53:51,280
fully ready unless we talk about this
 

6287
01:53:51,280 --> 01:53:53,350
fully ready unless we talk about this
and we start also

6288
01:53:53,350 --> 01:53:53,360
and we start also
 

6289
01:53:53,360 --> 01:53:55,750
and we start also
as i said just kind of expanding

6290
01:53:55,750 --> 01:53:55,760
as i said just kind of expanding
 

6291
01:53:55,760 --> 01:53:56,709
as i said just kind of expanding
the

6292
01:53:56,709 --> 01:53:56,719
the
 

6293
01:53:56,719 --> 01:53:58,229
the
the

6294
01:53:58,229 --> 01:53:58,239
the
 

6295
01:53:58,239 --> 01:54:00,390
the
the people we talk to to not include

6296
01:54:00,390 --> 01:54:00,400
the people we talk to to not include
 

6297
01:54:00,400 --> 01:54:03,030
the people we talk to to not include
only our our own researchers and so on

6298
01:54:03,030 --> 01:54:03,040
only our our own researchers and so on
 

6299
01:54:03,040 --> 01:54:05,270
only our our own researchers and so on
and in fact places like deepmind but

6300
01:54:05,270 --> 01:54:05,280
and in fact places like deepmind but
 

6301
01:54:05,280 --> 01:54:06,390
and in fact places like deepmind but
elsewhere

6302
01:54:06,390 --> 01:54:06,400
elsewhere
 

6303
01:54:06,400 --> 01:54:09,109
elsewhere
there's more interdisciplinary

6304
01:54:09,109 --> 01:54:09,119
there's more interdisciplinary
 

6305
01:54:09,119 --> 01:54:12,070
there's more interdisciplinary
groups forming up to start asking and

6306
01:54:12,070 --> 01:54:12,080
groups forming up to start asking and
 

6307
01:54:12,080 --> 01:54:13,510
groups forming up to start asking and
really working with us on these

6308
01:54:13,510 --> 01:54:13,520
really working with us on these
 

6309
01:54:13,520 --> 01:54:16,550
really working with us on these
questions um because obviously this is

6310
01:54:16,550 --> 01:54:16,560
questions um because obviously this is
 

6311
01:54:16,560 --> 01:54:18,390
questions um because obviously this is
not initially what your passion is when

6312
01:54:18,390 --> 01:54:18,400
not initially what your passion is when
 

6313
01:54:18,400 --> 01:54:20,709
not initially what your passion is when
you do your phd but certainly it is

6314
01:54:20,709 --> 01:54:20,719
you do your phd but certainly it is
 

6315
01:54:20,719 --> 01:54:22,709
you do your phd but certainly it is
coming right so it's it's fascinating

6316
01:54:22,709 --> 01:54:22,719
coming right so it's it's fascinating
 

6317
01:54:22,719 --> 01:54:24,470
coming right so it's it's fascinating
kind of it's it's the the thing that

6318
01:54:24,470 --> 01:54:24,480
kind of it's it's the the thing that
 

6319
01:54:24,480 --> 01:54:25,990
kind of it's it's the the thing that
brings me to

6320
01:54:25,990 --> 01:54:26,000
brings me to
 

6321
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,390
brings me to
one of my passions that is learning so

6322
01:54:28,390 --> 01:54:28,400
one of my passions that is learning so
 

6323
01:54:28,400 --> 01:54:31,030
one of my passions that is learning so
the in this sense this is kind of a new

6324
01:54:31,030 --> 01:54:31,040
the in this sense this is kind of a new
 

6325
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:33,430
the in this sense this is kind of a new
area that

6326
01:54:33,430 --> 01:54:33,440
area that
 

6327
01:54:33,440 --> 01:54:35,669
area that
as a learning system myself i want to

6328
01:54:35,669 --> 01:54:35,679
as a learning system myself i want to
 

6329
01:54:35,679 --> 01:54:37,510
as a learning system myself i want to
keep exploring and i think it's it's

6330
01:54:37,510 --> 01:54:37,520
keep exploring and i think it's it's
 

6331
01:54:37,520 --> 01:54:40,310
keep exploring and i think it's it's
great that um to see you know parts of

6332
01:54:40,310 --> 01:54:40,320
great that um to see you know parts of
 

6333
01:54:40,320 --> 01:54:43,030
great that um to see you know parts of
the debate and and even i seen a level

6334
01:54:43,030 --> 01:54:43,040
the debate and and even i seen a level
 

6335
01:54:43,040 --> 01:54:45,270
the debate and and even i seen a level
of maturity in the conferences that deal

6336
01:54:45,270 --> 01:54:45,280
of maturity in the conferences that deal
 

6337
01:54:45,280 --> 01:54:49,030
of maturity in the conferences that deal
with ai if you look five years ago um

6338
01:54:49,030 --> 01:54:49,040
with ai if you look five years ago um
 

6339
01:54:49,040 --> 01:54:51,589
with ai if you look five years ago um
to now just the amount of workshops and

6340
01:54:51,589 --> 01:54:51,599
to now just the amount of workshops and
 

6341
01:54:51,599 --> 01:54:53,669
to now just the amount of workshops and
so on has changed so much is is

6342
01:54:53,669 --> 01:54:53,679
so on has changed so much is is
 

6343
01:54:53,679 --> 01:54:57,270
so on has changed so much is is
impressive to see how much topics of um

6344
01:54:57,270 --> 01:54:57,280
impressive to see how much topics of um
 

6345
01:54:57,280 --> 01:54:59,589
impressive to see how much topics of um
you know safety ethics and so on come to

you know safety ethics and so on come to
 

6347
01:54:59,599 --> 01:55:01,910
you know safety ethics and so on come to
to the surface which is great and if you

6348
01:55:01,910 --> 01:55:01,920
to the surface which is great and if you
 

6349
01:55:01,920 --> 01:55:04,629
to the surface which is great and if you
were too early clearly it's fine i mean

so in that sense like i think it's great
 

6361
01:55:16,320 --> 01:55:18,149
so in that sense like i think it's great
that we're doing this already it's

6362
01:55:18,149 --> 01:55:18,159
that we're doing this already it's
 

6363
01:55:18,159 --> 01:55:20,070
that we're doing this already it's
better be too early than yeah too late

6364
01:55:20,070 --> 01:55:20,080
better be too early than yeah too late
 

6365
01:55:20,080 --> 01:55:21,910
better be too early than yeah too late

does not surprise me right so i think
 

6447
01:56:41,360 --> 01:56:43,430
does not surprise me right so i think
knowing ilia from before social media

6448
01:56:43,430 --> 01:56:43,440
knowing ilia from before social media
 

6449
01:56:43,440 --> 01:56:45,830
knowing ilia from before social media
and before ai was so prevalent i

6450
01:56:45,830 --> 01:56:45,840
and before ai was so prevalent i
 

6451
01:56:45,840 --> 01:56:47,510
and before ai was so prevalent i
recognized a lot of his characters so

6452
01:56:47,510 --> 01:56:47,520
recognized a lot of his characters so
 

6453
01:56:47,520 --> 01:56:49,910
recognized a lot of his characters so
that's something for me that i feel good

6454
01:56:49,910 --> 01:56:49,920
that's something for me that i feel good
 

6455
01:56:49,920 --> 01:56:52,629
that's something for me that i feel good
about a friend that hasn't changed or

6456
01:56:52,629 --> 01:56:52,639
about a friend that hasn't changed or
 

6457
01:56:52,639 --> 01:56:55,830
about a friend that hasn't changed or
like is still true to himself right um

6458
01:56:55,830 --> 01:56:55,840
like is still true to himself right um
 

6459
01:56:55,840 --> 01:56:58,550
like is still true to himself right um
obviously there is there is though a

6460
01:56:58,550 --> 01:56:58,560
obviously there is there is though a
 

6461
01:56:58,560 --> 01:56:59,589
obviously there is there is though a
fact that

6462
01:56:59,589 --> 01:56:59,599
fact that
 

6463
01:56:59,599 --> 01:57:02,790
fact that
your field becomes more popular and he

6464
01:57:02,790 --> 01:57:02,800
your field becomes more popular and he
 

6465
01:57:02,800 --> 01:57:04,709
your field becomes more popular and he
is obviously one of the main figures in

6466
01:57:04,709 --> 01:57:04,719
is obviously one of the main figures in
 

6467
01:57:04,719 --> 01:57:06,229
is obviously one of the main figures in
the field having done a lot of

6468
01:57:06,229 --> 01:57:06,239
the field having done a lot of
 

6469
01:57:06,239 --> 01:57:08,470
the field having done a lot of
advancement so i think that the tricky

6470
01:57:08,470 --> 01:57:08,480
advancement so i think that the tricky
 

6471
01:57:08,480 --> 01:57:10,709
advancement so i think that the tricky
bit here is how to balance your true

6472
01:57:10,709 --> 01:57:10,719
bit here is how to balance your true
 

6473
01:57:10,719 --> 01:57:12,390
bit here is how to balance your true
self with the responsibility that your

6474
01:57:12,390 --> 01:57:12,400
self with the responsibility that your
 

6475
01:57:12,400 --> 01:57:14,550
self with the responsibility that your
words carry so

6476
01:57:14,550 --> 01:57:14,560
words carry so
 

6477
01:57:14,560 --> 01:57:17,189
words carry so
in this sense i think yeah like i i i

6478
01:57:17,189 --> 01:57:17,199
in this sense i think yeah like i i i
 

6479
01:57:17,199 --> 01:57:19,270
in this sense i think yeah like i i i
appreciate the style and i understand it

6480
01:57:19,270 --> 01:57:19,280
appreciate the style and i understand it
 

6481
01:57:19,280 --> 01:57:20,629
appreciate the style and i understand it
but um

6482
01:57:20,629 --> 01:57:20,639
but um
 

6483
01:57:20,639 --> 01:57:23,189
but um
it created debates on like some some of

6484
01:57:23,189 --> 01:57:23,199
it created debates on like some some of
 

6485
01:57:23,199 --> 01:57:25,270
it created debates on like some some of
his tweets right that maybe it's good we

6486
01:57:25,270 --> 01:57:25,280
his tweets right that maybe it's good we
 

6487
01:57:25,280 --> 01:57:27,990
his tweets right that maybe it's good we
have them early anyways right but um but

6488
01:57:27,990 --> 01:57:28,000
have them early anyways right but um but
 

6489
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:29,910
have them early anyways right but um but
yeah it's it's then the reactions are

6490
01:57:29,910 --> 01:57:29,920
yeah it's it's then the reactions are
 

6491
01:57:29,920 --> 01:57:31,669
yeah it's it's then the reactions are
usually polarizing i think we're just

6492
01:57:31,669 --> 01:57:31,679
usually polarizing i think we're just
 

6493
01:57:31,679 --> 01:57:33,589
usually polarizing i think we're just
seeing kind of the reality of social

6494
01:57:33,589 --> 01:57:33,599
seeing kind of the reality of social
 

6495
01:57:33,599 --> 01:57:35,910
seeing kind of the reality of social
media a bit there as well reflected on

6496
01:57:35,910 --> 01:57:35,920
media a bit there as well reflected on
 

6497
01:57:35,920 --> 01:57:38,390
media a bit there as well reflected on
on that on that particular topic or set

6498
01:57:38,390 --> 01:57:38,400
on that on that particular topic or set
 

6499
01:57:38,400 --> 01:57:40,390
on that on that particular topic or set
of topics he's tweeting about yeah i

6500
01:57:40,390 --> 01:57:40,400
of topics he's tweeting about yeah i
 

6501
01:57:40,400 --> 01:57:42,390
of topics he's tweeting about yeah i
mean it's funny that he speak to this

6502
01:57:42,390 --> 01:57:42,400
mean it's funny that he speak to this
 

6503
01:57:42,400 --> 01:57:45,189
mean it's funny that he speak to this
tension he was one of the early

6504
01:57:45,189 --> 01:57:45,199
tension he was one of the early
 

6505
01:57:45,199 --> 01:57:46,790
tension he was one of the early
seminal figures in the field of deep

6506
01:57:46,790 --> 01:57:46,800
seminal figures in the field of deep
 

6507
01:57:46,800 --> 01:57:48,470
seminal figures in the field of deep
learning and so there's a responsibility

6508
01:57:48,470 --> 01:57:48,480
learning and so there's a responsibility
 

6509
01:57:48,480 --> 01:57:50,390
learning and so there's a responsibility
with that but he's also

6510
01:57:50,390 --> 01:57:50,400
with that but he's also
 

6511
01:57:50,400 --> 01:57:52,149
with that but he's also
from having interacted with him quite a

6512
01:57:52,149 --> 01:57:52,159
from having interacted with him quite a
 

6513
01:57:52,159 --> 01:57:53,030
from having interacted with him quite a
bit

6514
01:57:53,030 --> 01:57:53,040
bit
 

6515
01:57:53,040 --> 01:57:55,750
bit
he's just a brilliant thinker about

6516
01:57:55,750 --> 01:57:55,760
he's just a brilliant thinker about
 

6517
01:57:55,760 --> 01:57:57,350
he's just a brilliant thinker about
ideas

6518
01:57:57,350 --> 01:57:57,360
ideas
 

6519
01:57:57,360 --> 01:57:58,950
ideas
and um

6520
01:57:58,950 --> 01:57:58,960
and um
 

6521
01:57:58,960 --> 01:57:59,830
and um
which

6522
01:57:59,830 --> 01:57:59,840
which
 

6523
01:57:59,840 --> 01:58:02,149
which
as as are you and that there's a tension

6524
01:58:02,149 --> 01:58:02,159
as as are you and that there's a tension
 

6525
01:58:02,159 --> 01:58:04,950
as as are you and that there's a tension
between becoming the manager versus like

6526
01:58:04,950 --> 01:58:04,960
between becoming the manager versus like
 

6527
01:58:04,960 --> 01:58:08,070
between becoming the manager versus like
the actual thinking through very novel

6528
01:58:08,070 --> 01:58:08,080
the actual thinking through very novel
 

6529
01:58:08,080 --> 01:58:09,350
the actual thinking through very novel
ideas

6530
01:58:09,350 --> 01:58:09,360
ideas
 

6531
01:58:09,360 --> 01:58:10,550
ideas
the

6532
01:58:10,550 --> 01:58:10,560
the
 

6533
01:58:10,560 --> 01:58:12,390
the
yeah the the scientist versus the

6534
01:58:12,390 --> 01:58:12,400
yeah the the scientist versus the
 

6535
01:58:12,400 --> 01:58:13,510
yeah the the scientist versus the
manager

6536
01:58:13,510 --> 01:58:13,520
manager
 

6537
01:58:13,520 --> 01:58:15,030
manager
and he's

6538
01:58:15,030 --> 01:58:15,040
and he's
 

6539
01:58:15,040 --> 01:58:17,109
and he's
uh he's one of the great scientists of

6540
01:58:17,109 --> 01:58:17,119
uh he's one of the great scientists of
 

6541
01:58:17,119 --> 01:58:18,950
uh he's one of the great scientists of
our time this was quite interesting and

6542
01:58:18,950 --> 01:58:18,960
our time this was quite interesting and
 

6543
01:58:18,960 --> 01:58:20,950
our time this was quite interesting and
also people tell me quite silly which i

6544
01:58:20,950 --> 01:58:20,960
also people tell me quite silly which i
 

6545
01:58:20,960 --> 01:58:24,310
also people tell me quite silly which i
haven't quite detected yet but um in

6546
01:58:24,310 --> 01:58:24,320
haven't quite detected yet but um in
 

6547
01:58:24,320 --> 01:58:25,910
haven't quite detected yet but um in
private we'll have to see about that

6548
01:58:25,910 --> 01:58:25,920
private we'll have to see about that
 

6549
01:58:25,920 --> 01:58:27,030
private we'll have to see about that
yeah

6550
01:58:27,030 --> 01:58:27,040
yeah
 

6551
01:58:27,040 --> 01:58:29,589
yeah
yeah i mean just just on the point of i

6552
01:58:29,589 --> 01:58:29,599
yeah i mean just just on the point of i
 

6553
01:58:29,599 --> 01:58:31,350
yeah i mean just just on the point of i
mean ilia has been a

6554
01:58:31,350 --> 01:58:31,360
mean ilia has been a
 

6555
01:58:31,360 --> 01:58:32,790
mean ilia has been a
inspiration

6556
01:58:32,790 --> 01:58:32,800
inspiration
 

6557
01:58:32,800 --> 01:58:35,030
inspiration
um i mean quite a few colleagues i can

6558
01:58:35,030 --> 01:58:35,040
um i mean quite a few colleagues i can
 

6559
01:58:35,040 --> 01:58:37,910
um i mean quite a few colleagues i can
think shaped you know the person you are

6560
01:58:37,910 --> 01:58:37,920
think shaped you know the person you are
 

6561
01:58:37,920 --> 01:58:40,550
think shaped you know the person you are
like ilia certainly

6562
01:58:40,550 --> 01:58:40,560
like ilia certainly
 

6563
01:58:40,560 --> 01:58:42,709
like ilia certainly
gets probably the top spot if not close

6564
01:58:42,709 --> 01:58:42,719
gets probably the top spot if not close
 

6565
01:58:42,719 --> 01:58:44,550
gets probably the top spot if not close
to the top and

6566
01:58:44,550 --> 01:58:44,560
to the top and
 

6567
01:58:44,560 --> 01:58:46,790
to the top and
if we go back to the question about

6568
01:58:46,790 --> 01:58:46,800
if we go back to the question about
 

6569
01:58:46,800 --> 01:58:49,830
if we go back to the question about
people in the fields like how the role

6570
01:58:49,830 --> 01:58:49,840
people in the fields like how the role
 

6571
01:58:49,840 --> 01:58:51,750
people in the fields like how the role
would have changed the field or not i

6572
01:58:51,750 --> 01:58:51,760
would have changed the field or not i
 

6573
01:58:51,760 --> 01:58:55,189
would have changed the field or not i
think ilia's case is interesting because

6574
01:58:55,189 --> 01:58:55,199
think ilia's case is interesting because
 

6575
01:58:55,199 --> 01:58:57,990
think ilia's case is interesting because
he really has a deep belief in the

6576
01:58:57,990 --> 01:58:58,000
he really has a deep belief in the
 

6577
01:58:58,000 --> 01:58:59,830
he really has a deep belief in the
scaling up of neural networks there was

6578
01:58:59,830 --> 01:58:59,840
scaling up of neural networks there was
 

6579
01:58:59,840 --> 01:59:02,550
scaling up of neural networks there was
a talk that that that is still famous to

6580
01:59:02,550 --> 01:59:02,560
a talk that that that is still famous to
 

6581
01:59:02,560 --> 01:59:04,310
a talk that that that is still famous to
this day um from the sequence to

6582
01:59:04,310 --> 01:59:04,320
this day um from the sequence to
 

6583
01:59:04,320 --> 01:59:07,350
this day um from the sequence to
sequence paper um where where he was

6584
01:59:07,350 --> 01:59:07,360
sequence paper um where where he was
 

6585
01:59:07,360 --> 01:59:09,430
sequence paper um where where he was
just claiming just give me

6586
01:59:09,430 --> 01:59:09,440
just claiming just give me
 

6587
01:59:09,440 --> 01:59:11,669
just claiming just give me
supervised data and large neural network

6588
01:59:11,669 --> 01:59:11,679
supervised data and large neural network
 

6589
01:59:11,679 --> 01:59:13,589
supervised data and large neural network
and then you know you'll solve basically

6590
01:59:13,589 --> 01:59:13,599
and then you know you'll solve basically
 

6591
01:59:13,599 --> 01:59:16,470
and then you know you'll solve basically
all the problems right that that that

6592
01:59:16,470 --> 01:59:16,480
all the problems right that that that
 

6593
01:59:16,480 --> 01:59:18,709
all the problems right that that that
vision right was already already there

6594
01:59:18,709 --> 01:59:18,719
vision right was already already there
 

6595
01:59:18,719 --> 01:59:20,950
vision right was already already there
many years ago so it's it's good to see

6596
01:59:20,950 --> 01:59:20,960
many years ago so it's it's good to see
 

6597
01:59:20,960 --> 01:59:23,189
many years ago so it's it's good to see
like someone who's in this case very

6598
01:59:23,189 --> 01:59:23,199
like someone who's in this case very
 

6599
01:59:23,199 --> 01:59:24,149
like someone who's in this case very
deeply

6600
01:59:24,149 --> 01:59:24,159
deeply
 

6601
01:59:24,159 --> 01:59:28,070
deeply
into this style of research um and

6602
01:59:28,070 --> 01:59:28,080
into this style of research um and
 

6603
01:59:28,080 --> 01:59:31,109
into this style of research um and
clearly has had a tremendous

6604
01:59:31,109 --> 01:59:31,119
clearly has had a tremendous
 

6605
01:59:31,119 --> 01:59:33,990
clearly has had a tremendous
track record of successes and so on um

6606
01:59:33,990 --> 01:59:34,000
track record of successes and so on um
 

6607
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,550
track record of successes and so on um
the funny bit about that talk is that we

6608
01:59:36,550 --> 01:59:36,560
the funny bit about that talk is that we
 

6609
01:59:36,560 --> 01:59:38,149
the funny bit about that talk is that we
rehearsed the talk in a hotel room

6610
01:59:38,149 --> 01:59:38,159
rehearsed the talk in a hotel room
 

6611
01:59:38,159 --> 01:59:40,390
rehearsed the talk in a hotel room
before and

6612
01:59:40,390 --> 01:59:40,400
before and
 

6613
01:59:40,400 --> 01:59:42,070
before and
the original version of that talk would

6614
01:59:42,070 --> 01:59:42,080
the original version of that talk would
 

6615
01:59:42,080 --> 01:59:44,870
the original version of that talk would
have been even more controversial so

6616
01:59:44,870 --> 01:59:44,880
have been even more controversial so
 

6617
01:59:44,880 --> 01:59:46,870
have been even more controversial so
maybe i'm i'm the only person that has

6618
01:59:46,870 --> 01:59:46,880
maybe i'm i'm the only person that has
 

6619
01:59:46,880 --> 01:59:49,109
maybe i'm i'm the only person that has
seen the unfiltered version of the talk

6620
01:59:49,109 --> 01:59:49,119
seen the unfiltered version of the talk
 

6621
01:59:49,119 --> 01:59:51,270
seen the unfiltered version of the talk
um and you know maybe when the time

6622
01:59:51,270 --> 01:59:51,280
um and you know maybe when the time
 

6623
01:59:51,280 --> 01:59:53,270
um and you know maybe when the time
comes maybe we should revisit some of

6624
01:59:53,270 --> 01:59:53,280
comes maybe we should revisit some of
 

6625
01:59:53,280 --> 01:59:53,990
comes maybe we should revisit some of
the

6626
01:59:53,990 --> 01:59:54,000
the
 

6627
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,390
the
the skip slides from from the from from

6628
01:59:56,390 --> 01:59:56,400
the skip slides from from the from from
 

6629
01:59:56,400 --> 01:59:59,030
the skip slides from from the from from
the talk from emilia but i really think

6630
01:59:59,030 --> 01:59:59,040
the talk from emilia but i really think
 

6631
01:59:59,040 --> 02:00:00,149
the talk from emilia but i really think
um

6632
02:00:00,149 --> 02:00:00,159
um
 

6633
02:00:00,159 --> 02:00:02,550
um
the deep belief into some certain style

6634
02:00:02,550 --> 02:00:02,560
the deep belief into some certain style
 

6635
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:05,030
the deep belief into some certain style
of research pays out right is is is good

6636
02:00:05,030 --> 02:00:05,040
of research pays out right is is is good
 

6637
02:00:05,040 --> 02:00:06,950
of research pays out right is is is good
to be practical sometimes and i actually

6638
02:00:06,950 --> 02:00:06,960
to be practical sometimes and i actually
 

6639
02:00:06,960 --> 02:00:09,270
to be practical sometimes and i actually
think ilya and myself are like practical

6640
02:00:09,270 --> 02:00:09,280
think ilya and myself are like practical
 

6641
02:00:09,280 --> 02:00:11,350
think ilya and myself are like practical
but it's also good there's some sort of

6642
02:00:11,350 --> 02:00:11,360
but it's also good there's some sort of
 

6643
02:00:11,360 --> 02:00:12,709
but it's also good there's some sort of
long-term

6644
02:00:12,709 --> 02:00:12,719
long-term
 

6645
02:00:12,719 --> 02:00:15,350
long-term
belief and trajectory um obviously

6646
02:00:15,350 --> 02:00:15,360
belief and trajectory um obviously
 

6647
02:00:15,360 --> 02:00:17,030
belief and trajectory um obviously
there's a bit of luck involved but it

6648
02:00:17,030 --> 02:00:17,040
there's a bit of luck involved but it
 

6649
02:00:17,040 --> 02:00:18,950
there's a bit of luck involved but it
might be that that's the right path then

6650
02:00:18,950 --> 02:00:18,960
might be that that's the right path then
 

6651
02:00:18,960 --> 02:00:21,030
might be that that's the right path then

on the one hand we want to be data

6708
02:01:19,750 --> 02:01:19,760
on the one hand we want to be data
 

6709
02:01:19,760 --> 02:01:21,430
on the one hand we want to be data
agnostic we don't want to pre-process

6713
02:01:23,280 --> 02:01:25,830
data sets we want to see the bytes right
like the true data as it is and then

6714
02:01:25,830 --> 02:01:25,840
like the true data as it is and then
 

6715
02:01:25,840 --> 02:01:28,070
like the true data as it is and then
learn everything on top so

6716
02:01:28,070 --> 02:01:28,080
learn everything on top so
 

6717
02:01:28,080 --> 02:01:29,910
learn everything on top so
very much agree with that

6718
02:01:29,910 --> 02:01:29,920
very much agree with that
 

6719
02:01:29,920 --> 02:01:32,310
very much agree with that
and i think scaling up feels at the very

6720
02:01:32,310 --> 02:01:32,320
and i think scaling up feels at the very
 

6721
02:01:32,320 --> 02:01:35,109
and i think scaling up feels at the very
least again necessary for

02:01:35,109 --> 02:01:35,119
least again necessary for
 

6723
02:01:35,119 --> 02:01:38,870
least again necessary for
building incredible complex systems um

6724
02:01:38,870 --> 02:01:38,880
building incredible complex systems um
 

6725
02:01:38,880 --> 02:01:41,990
building incredible complex systems um
it's possibly not sufficient

6726
02:01:41,990 --> 02:01:42,000
it's possibly not sufficient
 

6727
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:43,510
it's possibly not sufficient
bearing that we need a couple of

02:01:43,510 --> 02:01:43,520
bearing that we need a couple of

breakthroughs um i think rich saturn

6730
02:01:46,310 --> 02:01:46,320
breakthroughs um i think rich saturn
 

6731
02:01:46,320 --> 02:01:47,270
breakthroughs um i think rich saturn
mentioned

6732
02:01:47,270 --> 02:01:47,280
mentioned
 

6733
02:01:47,280 --> 02:01:49,910
mentioned
search being part of the equation of

6734
02:01:49,910 --> 02:01:49,920
search being part of the equation of
 

6735
02:01:49,920 --> 02:01:53,669
search being part of the equation of
skill skill and search i think search

6736
02:01:53,669 --> 02:01:53,679
skill skill and search i think search
 

6737
02:01:53,679 --> 02:01:55,270
skill skill and search i think search
i've seen it

6738
02:01:55,270 --> 02:01:55,280
i've seen it
 

6739
02:01:55,280 --> 02:01:57,109
i've seen it
that's been more mixed in my experience

6740
02:01:57,109 --> 02:01:57,119
that's been more mixed in my experience
 

6741
02:01:57,119 --> 02:01:59,830
that's been more mixed in my experience
so from that lesson in particular search

6742
02:01:59,830 --> 02:01:59,840
so from that lesson in particular search
 

6743
02:01:59,840 --> 02:02:02,149
so from that lesson in particular search
is a bit more tricky because

6744
02:02:02,149 --> 02:02:02,159
is a bit more tricky because
 

6745
02:02:02,159 --> 02:02:03,669
is a bit more tricky because
it is very appealing to search in

6746
02:02:03,669 --> 02:02:03,679
it is very appealing to search in
 

6747
02:02:03,679 --> 02:02:06,470
it is very appealing to search in
domains like go where you have a clear

6748
02:02:06,470 --> 02:02:06,480
domains like go where you have a clear
 

6749
02:02:06,480 --> 02:02:07,990
domains like go where you have a clear
reward function that you can then

6750
02:02:07,990 --> 02:02:08,000
reward function that you can then
 

6751
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,470
reward function that you can then
discard some search traces

6752
02:02:10,470 --> 02:02:10,480
discard some search traces
 

6753
02:02:10,480 --> 02:02:11,510
discard some search traces
but then

6754
02:02:11,510 --> 02:02:11,520
but then
 

6755
02:02:11,520 --> 02:02:13,830
but then
in some other tasks it's not very clear

6756
02:02:13,830 --> 02:02:13,840
in some other tasks it's not very clear
 

6757
02:02:13,840 --> 02:02:16,310

how you would do that although recently

02:02:32,070 --> 02:02:32,080
the bitter lesson how scale of the

02:02:32,080 --> 02:02:33,750
the bitter lesson how scale of the
models and then a massive amount of

models and then a massive amount of
 

6777
02:02:33,760 --> 02:02:35,669
models and then a massive amount of
search yielded this kind of very

6778
02:02:35,669 --> 02:02:35,679
search yielded this kind of very
 

6779
02:02:35,679 --> 02:02:38,470
search yielded this kind of very
interesting result of being able to

6780
02:02:38,470 --> 02:02:38,480
interesting result of being able to
 

6781
02:02:38,480 --> 02:02:41,669
interesting result of being able to
have human level code competition so

i've seen examples of it being literally

02:02:44,070 --> 02:02:44,080
i've seen examples of it being literally
 

6785
02:02:44,080 --> 02:02:46,709
i've seen examples of it being literally
mapped to search and scale um i'm not so

6786
02:02:46,709 --> 02:02:46,719
mapped to search and scale um i'm not so
 

6787
02:02:46,719 --> 02:02:48,310
mapped to search and scale um i'm not so
convinced about the search bit but

6788
02:02:48,310 --> 02:02:48,320
convinced about the search bit but
 

6789
02:02:48,320 --> 02:02:50,470
convinced about the search bit but
certainly i'm convinced skill will be

6790
02:02:50,470 --> 02:02:50,480
certainly i'm convinced skill will be
 

6791
02:02:50,480 --> 02:02:52,629
certainly i'm convinced skill will be
needed so we need general methods we

6792
02:02:52,629 --> 02:02:52,639
needed so we need general methods we
 

6793
02:02:52,639 --> 02:02:54,229
needed so we need general methods we
need to test them and maybe we need to

6794
02:02:54,229 --> 02:02:54,239
need to test them and maybe we need to
 

6795
02:02:54,239 --> 02:02:56,310
need to test them and maybe we need to
make sure that we can scale them given

6796
02:02:56,310 --> 02:02:56,320
make sure that we can scale them given
 

6797
02:02:56,320 --> 02:02:58,950
make sure that we can scale them given
the hardware that we have in practice

6798
02:02:58,950 --> 02:02:58,960
the hardware that we have in practice
 

6799
02:02:58,960 --> 02:03:00,950
the hardware that we have in practice
but then maybe we should also shape how

6800
02:03:00,950 --> 02:03:00,960
but then maybe we should also shape how
 

6801
02:03:00,960 --> 02:03:03,350
but then maybe we should also shape how
the hardware looks like um based on

6802
02:03:03,350 --> 02:03:03,360
the hardware looks like um based on
 

6803
02:03:03,360 --> 02:03:05,510
the hardware looks like um based on
which methods might be needed to scale

6804
02:03:05,510 --> 02:03:05,520
which methods might be needed to scale
 

6805
02:03:05,520 --> 02:03:08,070
which methods might be needed to scale
and that's an interesting

6806
02:03:08,070 --> 02:03:08,080
and that's an interesting
 

6807
02:03:08,080 --> 02:03:11,030
and that's an interesting

is a bit tricky to define
 

6873
02:04:16,480 --> 02:04:19,350
is a bit tricky to define
especially when we look at the current

especially when we look at the current

02:04:19,360 --> 02:04:20,709
especially when we look at the current
formula of

starting from this imitation learning
 

6879
02:04:22,800 --> 02:04:25,189
starting from this imitation learning
standpoint right so we can certainly

6887
02:04:30,639 --> 02:04:32,709

so getting at human level through

6888
02:04:32,709 --> 02:04:32,719
so getting at human level through
 

6889
02:04:32,719 --> 02:04:34,870

um human level yes and i mean that in
itself is already quite powerful i think

6922
02:05:11,270 --> 02:05:11,280
itself is already quite powerful i think
 

6923
02:05:11,280 --> 02:05:13,589
itself is already quite powerful i think
so um going beyond i think it's

6924
02:05:13,589 --> 02:05:13,599
so um going beyond i think it's
 

6925
02:05:13,599 --> 02:05:15,750
so um going beyond i think it's
obviously not we're not gonna not try

6926
02:05:15,750 --> 02:05:15,760
obviously not we're not gonna not try
 

6927
02:05:15,760 --> 02:05:18,390
obviously not we're not gonna not try
that if if if it then we get to

6928
02:05:18,390 --> 02:05:18,400
that if if if it then we get to
 

6929
02:05:18,400 --> 02:05:19,830
that if if if it then we get to
superhuman

6930
02:05:19,830 --> 02:05:19,840
superhuman
 

6931
02:05:19,840 --> 02:05:22,069
superhuman
and discovery and advancing the world

6932
02:05:22,069 --> 02:05:22,079
and discovery and advancing the world
 

6933
02:05:22,079 --> 02:05:24,950
and discovery and advancing the world
but um but at least human level is also

6934
02:05:24,950 --> 02:05:24,960
but um but at least human level is also
 

6935
02:05:24,960 --> 02:05:27,510
but um but at least human level is also
in general is also very very powerful

6936
02:05:27,510 --> 02:05:27,520
in general is also very very powerful
 

6937
02:05:27,520 --> 02:05:30,550
in general is also very very powerful
well especially if human level or

6938
02:05:30,550 --> 02:05:30,560
well especially if human level or
 

6939
02:05:30,560 --> 02:05:32,709
well especially if human level or
slightly beyond is integrated deeply

6940
02:05:32,709 --> 02:05:32,719
slightly beyond is integrated deeply
 

6941
02:05:32,719 --> 02:05:34,310
slightly beyond is integrated deeply
with human society and there's billions

6942
02:05:34,310 --> 02:05:34,320
with human society and there's billions
 

6943
02:05:34,320 --> 02:05:36,149
with human society and there's billions
of agents like that

6944
02:05:36,149 --> 02:05:36,159
of agents like that
 

6945
02:05:36,159 --> 02:05:37,830
of agents like that
uh do you think there's a singularity

6946
02:05:37,830 --> 02:05:37,840
uh do you think there's a singularity
 

6947
02:05:37,840 --> 02:05:39,910
uh do you think there's a singularity
moment beyond which

6948
02:05:39,910 --> 02:05:39,920
moment beyond which
 

6949
02:05:39,920 --> 02:05:42,310
moment beyond which
our world will be just

6950
02:05:42,310 --> 02:05:42,320
our world will be just
 

6951
02:05:42,320 --> 02:05:44,709
our world will be just
very deeply transformed by these kinds

6952
02:05:44,709 --> 02:05:44,719
very deeply transformed by these kinds
 

6953
02:05:44,719 --> 02:05:46,470
very deeply transformed by these kinds
of systems because now you're talking

6954
02:05:46,470 --> 02:05:46,480
of systems because now you're talking
 

6955
02:05:46,480 --> 02:05:49,350
of systems because now you're talking
about intelligence systems that are

6956
02:05:49,350 --> 02:05:49,360
about intelligence systems that are
 

6957
02:05:49,360 --> 02:05:52,629
about intelligence systems that are
just i mean this is no longer just a

6958
02:05:52,629 --> 02:05:52,639
just i mean this is no longer just a
 

6959
02:05:52,639 --> 02:05:53,750
just i mean this is no longer just a
going from

6960
02:05:53,750 --> 02:05:53,760
going from
 

6961
02:05:53,760 --> 02:05:56,390
going from
horse and buggy to to the car

6962
02:05:56,390 --> 02:05:56,400
horse and buggy to to the car
 

6963
02:05:56,400 --> 02:05:58,790
horse and buggy to to the car
it feels like a very different kind of

6964
02:05:58,790 --> 02:05:58,800
it feels like a very different kind of
 

6965
02:05:58,800 --> 02:05:59,669
it feels like a very different kind of
shift

6966
02:05:59,669 --> 02:05:59,679
shift
 

6967
02:05:59,679 --> 02:06:01,830
shift
and what it means to be a living entity

6968
02:06:01,830 --> 02:06:01,840
and what it means to be a living entity
 

6969
02:06:01,840 --> 02:06:03,189
and what it means to be a living entity
on earth

6970
02:06:03,189 --> 02:06:03,199
on earth
 

6971
02:06:03,199 --> 02:06:05,589
on earth
are you afraid are you excited of this

6972
02:06:05,589 --> 02:06:05,599
are you afraid are you excited of this
 

6973
02:06:05,599 --> 02:06:09,270
are you afraid are you excited of this
world i'm afraid if there's a lot more

6974
02:06:09,270 --> 02:06:09,280
world i'm afraid if there's a lot more
 

6975
02:06:09,280 --> 02:06:11,750
world i'm afraid if there's a lot more
so i think maybe we'll need to think

6976
02:06:11,750 --> 02:06:11,760
so i think maybe we'll need to think
 

6977
02:06:11,760 --> 02:06:12,950
so i think maybe we'll need to think
about

6978
02:06:12,950 --> 02:06:12,960
about
 

6979
02:06:12,960 --> 02:06:14,870
about
if we truly get there

6980
02:06:14,870 --> 02:06:14,880
if we truly get there
 

6981
02:06:14,880 --> 02:06:15,830
if we truly get there
just

6982
02:06:15,830 --> 02:06:15,840
just
 

6983
02:06:15,840 --> 02:06:17,189
just
thinking of

6984
02:06:17,189 --> 02:06:17,199
thinking of
 

6985
02:06:17,199 --> 02:06:19,910
thinking of
limited resources like you know humanity

6986
02:06:19,910 --> 02:06:19,920
limited resources like you know humanity
 

6987
02:06:19,920 --> 02:06:21,750
limited resources like you know humanity
clearly hits some limits and then

6988
02:06:21,750 --> 02:06:21,760
clearly hits some limits and then
 

6989
02:06:21,760 --> 02:06:23,510
clearly hits some limits and then
there's some balance hopefully that

6990
02:06:23,510 --> 02:06:23,520
there's some balance hopefully that
 

6991
02:06:23,520 --> 02:06:26,229
there's some balance hopefully that
biologically um the planet is imposing

6992
02:06:26,229 --> 02:06:26,239
biologically um the planet is imposing
 

6993
02:06:26,239 --> 02:06:27,750
biologically um the planet is imposing
and we we should actually try to get

6994
02:06:27,750 --> 02:06:27,760
and we we should actually try to get
 

6995
02:06:27,760 --> 02:06:29,270
and we we should actually try to get
better at this as we know there's

6996
02:06:29,270 --> 02:06:29,280
better at this as we know there's
 

6997
02:06:29,280 --> 02:06:30,709
better at this as we know there's
there's quite a few

6998
02:06:30,709 --> 02:06:30,719
there's quite a few
 

6999
02:06:30,719 --> 02:06:33,750
there's quite a few
you know issues with having too many

7000
02:06:33,750 --> 02:06:33,760
you know issues with having too many
 

7001
02:06:33,760 --> 02:06:36,550
you know issues with having too many
people um coexisting in a resource

7002
02:06:36,550 --> 02:06:36,560
people um coexisting in a resource
 

7003
02:06:36,560 --> 02:06:39,189
people um coexisting in a resource
limited way so for digital entities it's

7004
02:06:39,189 --> 02:06:39,199
limited way so for digital entities it's
 

7005
02:06:39,199 --> 02:06:41,109
limited way so for digital entities it's
an interesting question i think such a

7006
02:06:41,109 --> 02:06:41,119
an interesting question i think such a
 

7007
02:06:41,119 --> 02:06:43,430
an interesting question i think such a
limit maybe should exist

7008
02:06:43,430 --> 02:06:43,440
limit maybe should exist
 

7009
02:06:43,440 --> 02:06:45,830
limit maybe should exist
but maybe it's going to be imposed by

7010
02:06:45,830 --> 02:06:45,840
but maybe it's going to be imposed by
 

7011
02:06:45,840 --> 02:06:46,870
but maybe it's going to be imposed by
energy

7012
02:06:46,870 --> 02:06:46,880
energy
 

7013
02:06:46,880 --> 02:06:49,350
energy
availability because this also consumes

7014
02:06:49,350 --> 02:06:49,360
availability because this also consumes
 

7015
02:06:49,360 --> 02:06:50,550
availability because this also consumes
energy in fact

7016
02:06:50,550 --> 02:06:50,560
energy in fact
 

7017
02:06:50,560 --> 02:06:52,629
energy in fact
most systems are

7018
02:06:52,629 --> 02:06:52,639
most systems are
 

7019
02:06:52,639 --> 02:06:54,709
most systems are
more inefficient than we are in terms of

7020
02:06:54,709 --> 02:06:54,719
more inefficient than we are in terms of
 

7021
02:06:54,719 --> 02:06:56,709
more inefficient than we are in terms of
energy required

7022
02:06:56,709 --> 02:06:56,719
energy required
 

7023
02:06:56,719 --> 02:06:59,430
energy required
but definitely i think as a society

7024
02:06:59,430 --> 02:06:59,440
but definitely i think as a society
 

7025
02:06:59,440 --> 02:07:01,030
but definitely i think as a society
we'll need to

7026
02:07:01,030 --> 02:07:01,040
we'll need to
 

7027
02:07:01,040 --> 02:07:03,510
we'll need to
just work together to find

7028
02:07:03,510 --> 02:07:03,520
just work together to find
 

7029
02:07:03,520 --> 02:07:05,830
just work together to find
what would be reasonable in terms of

7030
02:07:05,830 --> 02:07:05,840
what would be reasonable in terms of
 

7031
02:07:05,840 --> 02:07:09,750
what would be reasonable in terms of
growth or how we coexist if that is

7032
02:07:09,750 --> 02:07:09,760
growth or how we coexist if that is
 

7033
02:07:09,760 --> 02:07:11,270
growth or how we coexist if that is
to happen

7034
02:07:11,270 --> 02:07:11,280
to happen
 

7035
02:07:11,280 --> 02:07:14,069
to happen
i am very excited about

7036
02:07:14,069 --> 02:07:14,079
i am very excited about
 

7037
02:07:14,079 --> 02:07:16,550
i am very excited about
obviously the aspects of automation that

7038
02:07:16,550 --> 02:07:16,560
obviously the aspects of automation that
 

7039
02:07:16,560 --> 02:07:18,629
obviously the aspects of automation that
make people that obviously don't have

7040
02:07:18,629 --> 02:07:18,639
make people that obviously don't have
 

7041
02:07:18,639 --> 02:07:21,109
make people that obviously don't have
access to certain resources or knowledge

7042
02:07:21,109 --> 02:07:21,119
access to certain resources or knowledge
 

7043
02:07:21,119 --> 02:07:21,990
access to certain resources or knowledge
um

7044
02:07:21,990 --> 02:07:22,000
um
 

7045
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:23,910
um
for them to have those that access i

7046
02:07:23,910 --> 02:07:23,920
for them to have those that access i
 

7047
02:07:23,920 --> 02:07:25,990
for them to have those that access i
think those are the applications in a

7048
02:07:25,990 --> 02:07:26,000
think those are the applications in a
 

7049
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,629
think those are the applications in a
way that i'm most exciting to see

7050
02:07:28,629 --> 02:07:28,639
way that i'm most exciting to see
 

7051
02:07:28,639 --> 02:07:30,950
way that i'm most exciting to see
um and to personally work towards yeah

7052
02:07:30,950 --> 02:07:30,960
um and to personally work towards yeah
 

7053
02:07:30,960 --> 02:07:32,149
um and to personally work towards yeah
there's going to be significant

7054
02:07:32,149 --> 02:07:32,159
there's going to be significant
 

7055
02:07:32,159 --> 02:07:33,510
there's going to be significant
improvements in productivity and the

7056
02:07:33,510 --> 02:07:33,520
improvements in productivity and the
 

7057
02:07:33,520 --> 02:07:34,950
improvements in productivity and the
quality of life across the whole

7058
02:07:34,950 --> 02:07:34,960
quality of life across the whole
 

7059
02:07:34,960 --> 02:07:37,030
quality of life across the whole
population which is very interesting but

7060
02:07:37,030 --> 02:07:37,040
population which is very interesting but
 

7061
02:07:37,040 --> 02:07:39,350
population which is very interesting but
i'm looking even far beyond

7062
02:07:39,350 --> 02:07:39,360
i'm looking even far beyond
 

7063
02:07:39,360 --> 02:07:42,629
i'm looking even far beyond
us becoming a multi-planetary species

7064
02:07:42,629 --> 02:07:42,639
us becoming a multi-planetary species
 

7065
02:07:42,639 --> 02:07:45,270
us becoming a multi-planetary species
and uh just as a quick bet last question

7066
02:07:45,270 --> 02:07:45,280
and uh just as a quick bet last question
 

7067
02:07:45,280 --> 02:07:46,310
and uh just as a quick bet last question
do you think

7068
02:07:46,310 --> 02:07:46,320
do you think
 

7069
02:07:46,320 --> 02:07:49,109
do you think
as humans become multi-planetary species

7070
02:07:49,109 --> 02:07:49,119
as humans become multi-planetary species
 

7071
02:07:49,119 --> 02:07:51,109
as humans become multi-planetary species
go outside our solar system

7072
02:07:51,109 --> 02:07:51,119
go outside our solar system
 

7073
02:07:51,119 --> 02:07:52,709
go outside our solar system
all that kind of stuff do you think

7074
02:07:52,709 --> 02:07:52,719
all that kind of stuff do you think
 

7075
02:07:52,719 --> 02:07:55,589
all that kind of stuff do you think
there will be more humans or more robots

7076
02:07:55,589 --> 02:07:55,599
there will be more humans or more robots
 

7077
02:07:55,599 --> 02:08:00,149
there will be more humans or more robots
in that future world so will humans be

7078
02:08:00,149 --> 02:08:00,159
in that future world so will humans be
 

7079
02:08:00,159 --> 02:08:01,910
in that future world so will humans be
the quirky

7080
02:08:01,910 --> 02:08:01,920
the quirky
 

7081
02:08:01,920 --> 02:08:04,629
the quirky
uh intelligent being of the past or is

7082
02:08:04,629 --> 02:08:04,639
uh intelligent being of the past or is
 

7083
02:08:04,639 --> 02:08:07,109
uh intelligent being of the past or is

7091
02:08:13,840 --> 02:08:16,709
planets not just ai systems
i think we'll we're all excited to

7092
02:08:16,709 --> 02:08:16,719
i think we'll we're all excited to

or make us more powerful as human

7100
02:08:24,069 --> 02:08:24,079
or make us more powerful as human

species not to say there might be some

7102
02:08:26,470 --> 02:08:26,480
species not to say there might be some
 

7103
02:08:26,480 --> 02:08:28,870
species not to say there might be some
hybridization i mean this is obviously

7104
02:08:28,870 --> 02:08:28,880
hybridization i mean this is obviously
 

7105
02:08:28,880 --> 02:08:31,030
hybridization i mean this is obviously
speculation but there are companies also

7106
02:08:31,030 --> 02:08:31,040
speculation but there are companies also
 

7107
02:08:31,040 --> 02:08:31,990
speculation but there are companies also
trying to

7108
02:08:31,990 --> 02:08:32,000
trying to
 

7109
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,629
trying to
um the same way medicine is is making us

7110
02:08:34,629 --> 02:08:34,639
um the same way medicine is is making us
 

7111
02:08:34,639 --> 02:08:36,790
um the same way medicine is is making us
better maybe there are other other

7112
02:08:36,790 --> 02:08:36,800
better maybe there are other other
 

7113
02:08:36,800 --> 02:08:39,030
better maybe there are other other
things that are yet to happen on that

7114
02:08:39,030 --> 02:08:39,040
things that are yet to happen on that
 

7115
02:08:39,040 --> 02:08:40,390
things that are yet to happen on that
but

7116
02:08:40,390 --> 02:08:40,400
but
 

7117
02:08:40,400 --> 02:08:43,430
but
if the ratio is not at most one to one i

7118
02:08:43,430 --> 02:08:43,440
if the ratio is not at most one to one i
 

7119
02:08:43,440 --> 02:08:46,470
if the ratio is not at most one to one i
would not be happy so i would hope that

7120
02:08:46,470 --> 02:08:46,480
would not be happy so i would hope that
 

7121
02:08:46,480 --> 02:08:49,990
would not be happy so i would hope that
we are part of the equation um but maybe

7122
02:08:49,990 --> 02:08:50,000
we are part of the equation um but maybe
 

7123
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:51,350
we are part of the equation um but maybe
there's

7124
02:08:51,350 --> 02:08:51,360
there's
 

7125
02:08:51,360 --> 02:08:53,510
there's
maybe a one-to-one ratio feels like

7126
02:08:53,510 --> 02:08:53,520
maybe a one-to-one ratio feels like
 

7127
02:08:53,520 --> 02:08:56,310
maybe a one-to-one ratio feels like
possible um constructive and so on but

7128
02:08:56,310 --> 02:08:56,320
possible um constructive and so on but
 

7129
02:08:56,320 --> 02:08:58,310
possible um constructive and so on but
it would not be good to have a

7130
02:08:58,310 --> 02:08:58,320
it would not be good to have a
 

7131
02:08:58,320 --> 02:09:01,350
it would not be good to have a
misbalance at least from my core beliefs

7132
02:09:01,350 --> 02:09:01,360
misbalance at least from my core beliefs
 

7133
02:09:01,360 --> 02:09:01,990
misbalance at least from my core beliefs
and

7134
02:09:01,990 --> 02:09:02,000
and
 

7135
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,470
and
the why i'm doing what i'm doing when i

7136
02:09:04,470 --> 02:09:04,480
the why i'm doing what i'm doing when i
 

7137
02:09:04,480 --> 02:09:05,910
the why i'm doing what i'm doing when i
go to work and i research what i

02:09:05,910 --> 02:09:05,920
go to work and i research what i

test

7146

test
 

7147
02:09:12,639 --> 02:09:14,870

speak again maybe once before the
 

7155
02:09:21,119 --> 02:09:23,910
speak again maybe once before the
singularity once after and see how our

7156
02:09:23,910 --> 02:09:23,920
singularity once after and see how our
 

7157
02:09:23,920 --> 02:09:25,589
singularity once after and see how our
view of the world changes thank you
