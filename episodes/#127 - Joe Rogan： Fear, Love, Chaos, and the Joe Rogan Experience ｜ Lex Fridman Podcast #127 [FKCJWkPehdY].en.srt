and this
 

211
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:20,069
and this
and it's a small thing like in terms of

212
00:04:20,069 --> 00:04:20,079
and it's a small thing like in terms of
 

213
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,990
and it's a small thing like in terms of
the like the possibilities of things

214
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:22,000
the like the possibilities of things
 

215
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,270
the like the possibilities of things
that could happen to the world like a

216
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:23,280
that could happen to the world like a
 

217
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:23,909
that could happen to the world like a
pandemic

218
00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:23,919
pandemic
 

219
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,590
pandemic
like the one we've experienced it really

220
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:25,600
like the one we've experienced it really
 

221
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,510
like the one we've experienced it really
just doubles the amount of deaths

222
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:27,520
just doubles the amount of deaths
 

223
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,310
just doubles the amount of deaths
on a bad flu year so it relatively

224
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:30,320
on a bad flu year so it relatively
 

225
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:30,950
on a bad flu year so it relatively
speaking

226
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:30,960
speaking
 

227
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,230
speaking
is a small thing comparison to

00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:34,240
is a small thing comparison to
 

229
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,150
is a small thing comparison to

our society really is that something
like this can come along some

248
00:04:57,189 --> 00:04:57,199
like this can come along some
 

249
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,469

and uh
the images that you can see you know

268
00:05:12,469 --> 00:05:12,479
the images that you can see you know
 

269
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,990
the images that you can see you know
with the videos of

275
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,270
are an all-time high
to a point where like if you asked me

276
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:21,280
to a point where like if you asked me
 

277
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,029
to a point where like if you asked me
just five or six years ago

278
00:05:23,029 --> 00:05:23,039
just five or six years ago
 

279
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,469
just five or six years ago
like are have racial problems in this

283
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,070
country largely been alleviated i'd
probably say yeah it's way better than

284
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:30,080
probably say yeah it's way better than
 

285
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,110
probably say yeah it's way better than
it's ever been before

it's ever been before
 

287
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,710
it's ever been before
but now you could argue that it's not

288
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:32,720
but now you could argue that it's not
 

289
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,990
but now you could argue that it's not
now you could argue it's no it's way

290
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:34,000
now you could argue it's no it's way
 

291
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,469
now you could argue it's no it's way
worse

292
00:05:34,469 --> 00:05:34,479
worse
 

293
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,790
worse
in just a small amount of time it's way

294
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:36,800
in just a small amount of time it's way
 

295
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,390
in just a small amount of time it's way
worse than it's ever been during

296
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:38,400
worse than it's ever been during
 

297
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,110
worse than it's ever been during
my lifetime you cut well while i'm aware

298
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:41,120
my lifetime you cut well while i'm aware
 

299
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,950
my lifetime you cut well while i'm aware
of it you know obviously when i was a

300
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:42,960
of it you know obviously when i was a
 

301
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,790
of it you know obviously when i was a
young boy in the 60s they were still

302
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:44,800
young boy in the 60s they were still
 

303
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,870
young boy in the 60s they were still
going through the civil rights movement

304
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:46,880
going through the civil rights movement
 

305
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,990
going through the civil rights movement
but now uh it just seems

306
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:50,000
but now uh it just seems
 

307
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,230
but now uh it just seems
very fever-pitched and i think a lot of

308
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:52,240
very fever-pitched and i think a lot of
 

309
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,990
very fever-pitched and i think a lot of
that is because of the pandemic and is

310
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:54,000
that is because of the pandemic and is
 

311
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,029
that is because of the pandemic and is
because of all the

312
00:05:55,029 --> 00:05:55,039
because of all the
 

313
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,230
because of all the
the heightened uh just tension

314
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:58,240
the heightened uh just tension
 

315
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,350
the heightened uh just tension
the one i liken it to is

316
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:01,360
the one i liken it to is
 

317
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,230
the one i liken it to is
um road rage because you know people

318
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:04,240
um road rage because you know people
 

319
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,430
um road rage because you know people
have road rage

320
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:05,440
have road rage
 

321
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,870
have road rage
not just because they're in the car no

322
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:06,880
not just because they're in the car no
 

323
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,710
not just because they're in the car no
one can get to them but also because

324
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:08,720
one can get to them but also because
 

325
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,469
one can get to them but also because
you're at a heightened state

326
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:10,479
you're at a heightened state
 

327
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,230
you're at a heightened state
because you're driving fast and you know

328
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:12,240
because you're driving fast and you know
 

329
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,590
because you're driving fast and you know
you're driving fast you know you have to

330
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:13,600
you're driving fast you know you have to
 

331
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,189
you're driving fast you know you have to
make split-second movements and so

332

00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:45,110
what's your a game
what would you go from standing up how

1684
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:45,120
what would you go from standing up how
 

1685
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,870
what would you go from standing up how
would you go to submission would you

1686
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:46,880
would you go to submission would you
 

1687
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,029
would you go to submission would you
pull guard would you take down

1688
00:27:49,029 --> 00:27:49,039
pull guard would you take down
 

1689
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:51,669
pull guard would you take down
what how would you pass guard what's i

1690
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:51,679
what how would you pass guard what's i
 

1691
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:53,029
what how would you pass guard what's i
don't have good takedowns i mean i was

1692
00:27:53,029 --> 00:27:53,039
don't have good takedowns i mean i was
