185
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,920
general in your eyes well the biggest
thing that happened was the invention of

186
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:41,930
thing that happened was the invention of
 

187
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,410
thing that happened was the invention of
the microprocessor so computers that

188
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:44,420
the microprocessor so computers that
 

189
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,930
the microprocessor so computers that
used to fill up several rooms could fit

190
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:46,940
used to fill up several rooms could fit
 

191
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:51,789
used to fill up several rooms could fit
inside your cell phone and not only and

192
00:03:51,789 --> 00:03:51,799
inside your cell phone and not only and
 

193
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:53,860
inside your cell phone and not only and
how do they get smaller they got a lot

194
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:53,870
how do they get smaller they got a lot
 

195
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:56,949
how do they get smaller they got a lot
faster so they're million times faster

196
00:03:56,949 --> 00:03:56,959
faster so they're million times faster
 

197
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,009
faster so they're million times faster
than they were 50 years ago and they're

198
00:04:00,009 --> 00:04:00,019
than they were 50 years ago and they're
 

199
00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:02,199
than they were 50 years ago and they're
much cheaper and they're RIBA covetous

200
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:02,209
much cheaper and they're RIBA covetous
 

201

it's probably more micro processors than

210
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:14,170
it's probably more micro processors than
 

211
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,199
it's probably more micro processors than
there are people sure I don't know what

00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:16,209
there are people sure I don't know what
 

213
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:18,560
there are people sure I don't know what
the ratio is but I'm sure it's above one

214
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:18,570
the ratio is but I'm sure it's above one
 

215
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:21,060
the ratio is but I'm sure it's above one
maybe it's ten to one or some number

216
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:21,070
maybe it's ten to one or some number
 

217
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:25,320
maybe it's ten to one or some number
like that what is a microprocessor so a

218
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:25,330
like that what is a microprocessor so a
 

219
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:27,870
like that what is a microprocessor so a
way to say what a microprocessor is to

220
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:27,880
way to say what a microprocessor is to
 

221
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,940
way to say what a microprocessor is to
tell you what's inside a computer so a

222
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:29,950
tell you what's inside a computer so a
 

223
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:32,250
tell you what's inside a computer so a
computer forever has classically had

224
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:32,260
computer forever has classically had
 

225
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:35,250
computer forever has classically had
five pieces there's input and output

226
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:35,260
five pieces there's input and output
 

227
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,230
five pieces there's input and output
which kind of naturally as you'd expect

228
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:37,240
which kind of naturally as you'd expect
 

229
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,650
which kind of naturally as you'd expect
is input is like speech or typing and

230
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:40,660
is input is like speech or typing and
 

231
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:46,080
is input is like speech or typing and
output is displays there's a memory and

232
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:46,090
output is displays there's a memory and
 

233
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:49,470
output is displays there's a memory and
like the name sounds it it remembers

234
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:49,480
like the name sounds it it remembers
 

235
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,470
like the name sounds it it remembers
things so it's integrated circuits whose

236
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:52,480
things so it's integrated circuits whose
 

237
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,660
things so it's integrated circuits whose
job is you put information in and when

238
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:54,670
job is you put information in and when
 

239
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,040
job is you put information in and when
you ask for it it comes back out that's

240
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,050
you ask for it it comes back out that's
 

241
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:58,230
you ask for it it comes back out that's
memory and the third part is the

242
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:58,240
memory and the third part is the
 

243
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,110
memory and the third part is the
processor where the team microprocessor

244
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:01,120
processor where the team microprocessor
 

245
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,750
processor where the team microprocessor
comes from and that has two pieces as

246
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:03,760
comes from and that has two pieces as
 

247
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,330
comes from and that has two pieces as
well and that is the control which is

248
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:06,340
well and that is the control which is
 

249
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:09,890
well and that is the control which is
kind of the brain of the processor and

250
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:09,900
kind of the brain of the processor and
 

251
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,620
kind of the brain of the processor and
the what's called the arithmetic unit

252
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:13,630
the what's called the arithmetic unit
 

253
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,360
the what's called the arithmetic unit
it's kind of the Brawn of the computer

254
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:15,370
it's kind of the Brawn of the computer
 

255
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:17,340
it's kind of the Brawn of the computer
so if you think of the as a human body

256
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:17,350
so if you think of the as a human body
 

257
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,650
so if you think of the as a human body
the arithmetic unit the thing that does

258
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:19,660
the arithmetic unit the thing that does
 

259
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,630
the arithmetic unit the thing that does
the number crunching is the is the body

260
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:21,640
the number crunching is the is the body
 

261
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,700
the number crunching is the is the body
and the control is the brain so those

262
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:23,710
and the control is the brain so those
 

263
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:27,530
and the control is the brain so those
five pieces input/output memory

264
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:27,540
five pieces input/output memory
 

265
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:30,840
five pieces input/output memory
arithmetic unit and control are have

266
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:30,850
arithmetic unit and control are have
 

267
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:33,390
arithmetic unit and control are have
been in computers since the very dawn in

268
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:33,400
been in computers since the very dawn in
 

269
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,270
been in computers since the very dawn in
the last two are considered the

270
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:35,280
the last two are considered the
 

271
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,800
the last two are considered the
processor so a microprocessor simply

272
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:37,810
processor so a microprocessor simply
 

273
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:39,870
processor so a microprocessor simply
means a process of the fits on a

274
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:39,880
means a process of the fits on a
 

275
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,210
means a process of the fits on a
microchip and that was invented at about

276
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:42,220
microchip and that was invented at about
 

277
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,910
microchip and that was invented at about
you know 40 years ago was the first

278
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:44,920
you know 40 years ago was the first
 

279
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,160
you know 40 years ago was the first
microprocessor it's interesting that you

280
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:47,170
microprocessor it's interesting that you
 

281
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:50,040
microprocessor it's interesting that you
refer to the arithmetic unit as the like

282
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,050
refer to the arithmetic unit as the like
 

283
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:52,530
refer to the arithmetic unit as the like
he connected to the body and the

284
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:52,540
he connected to the body and the
 

285
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,900
he connected to the body and the
controller's of the brain so I guess I

286
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:54,910
controller's of the brain so I guess I
 

287
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:57,300
controller's of the brain so I guess I
never thought of it that was a nice way

288
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:57,310
never thought of it that was a nice way
 

289
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,560
never thought of it that was a nice way
to think of it because most of the

290
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:58,570
to think of it because most of the
 

291
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:02,160
to think of it because most of the
actions the microprocessor does in terms

292
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,170
actions the microprocessor does in terms
 

293
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:05,400
actions the microprocessor does in terms
of literally sort of computation with

294
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:05,410
of literally sort of computation with
 

295
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:07,530
of literally sort of computation with
the microprocessor does computation it

296
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:07,540
the microprocessor does computation it
 

297
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,840
the microprocessor does computation it
processes information and most of the

298
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:09,850
processes information and most of the
 

299
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:12,780
processes information and most of the
thing it does is basically earth net

300
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:12,790
thing it does is basically earth net
 

301
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:15,090
thing it does is basically earth net
arithmetic operations what what are the

302
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:15,100
arithmetic operations what what are the
 

303
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,950
arithmetic operations what what are the
operations by the way it's a lot like a

304
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:16,960
operations by the way it's a lot like a
 

305
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,070
operations by the way it's a lot like a
calculator you know so there are add

306
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:20,080
calculator you know so there are add
 

307
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,590
calculator you know so there are add
instructions a subtractive Stressless

kind of the brilliance of the invention

312
00:06:28,599 --> 00:06:28,609
kind of the brilliance of the invention
 

313
00:06:28,609 --> 00:06:32,489
kind of the brilliance of the invention
of the my computer or the processor is

314
00:06:32,489 --> 00:06:32,499
of the my computer or the processor is
 

315
00:06:32,499 --> 00:06:35,769
of the my computer or the processor is
that it performs very trivial operations

316
00:06:35,769 --> 00:06:35,779
that it performs very trivial operations
 

317
00:06:35,779 --> 00:06:37,779
that it performs very trivial operations
but it just performs billions of them

318
00:06:37,779 --> 00:06:37,789
but it just performs billions of them
 

319
00:06:37,789 --> 00:06:40,929
but it just performs billions of them
per second and what we're capable of

320
00:06:40,929 --> 00:06:40,939
per second and what we're capable of

00:06:40,939 --> 00:06:43,269
per second and what we're capable of
doing is writing software that can take

322
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:43,279
doing is writing software that can take
 

323
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:45,939
doing is writing software that can take
these very trivial instructions and have

324
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:45,949
these very trivial instructions and have
 

325
00:06:45,949 --> 00:06:47,919
these very trivial instructions and have
them create tasks that can do things

326
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:47,929
them create tasks that can do things
 

327
00:06:47,929 --> 00:06:49,769
them create tasks that can do things
better than human beings can do today

328
00:06:49,769 --> 00:06:49,779
better than human beings can do today
 

329
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:52,419
better than human beings can do today

did you anticipate the kind of how good

332
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:54,769
did you anticipate the kind of how good
 

333
00:06:54,769 --> 00:06:56,739
did you anticipate the kind of how good
we would be able to get at doing these

334
00:06:56,739 --> 00:06:56,749
we would be able to get at doing these
 

335
00:06:56,749 --> 00:07:01,329
we would be able to get at doing these
small basic operations I think what how

336
00:07:01,329 --> 00:07:01,339
small basic operations I think what how
 

337
00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:03,369
small basic operations I think what how
many surprises along the way we just

338
00:07:03,369 --> 00:07:03,379
many surprises along the way we just
 

339
00:07:03,379 --> 00:07:07,299
many surprises along the way we just
kind of set back and said wow I didn't

340
00:07:07,299 --> 00:07:07,309
kind of set back and said wow I didn't
 

341
00:07:07,309 --> 00:07:09,999
kind of set back and said wow I didn't
expect it to go this fast this good well

00:07:09,999 --> 00:07:10,009
expect it to go this fast this good well

what scored Moore's law which was named

346
00:07:16,029 --> 00:07:16,039
what scored Moore's law which was named
 

347
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:18,579
what scored Moore's law which was named
after Gordon Moore who's a Berkeley

348
00:07:18,579 --> 00:07:18,589
after Gordon Moore who's a Berkeley
 

349
00:07:18,589 --> 00:07:21,059
after Gordon Moore who's a Berkeley
alumnus and he made this observation

350
00:07:21,059 --> 00:07:21,069
alumnus and he made this observation
 

351
00:07:21,069 --> 00:07:23,739
alumnus and he made this observation
very early in what are called semi

352
00:07:23,739 --> 00:07:23,749
very early in what are called semi
 

353
00:07:23,749 --> 00:07:25,719
very early in what are called semi
conductors and semiconductors are these

354
00:07:25,719 --> 00:07:25,729
conductors and semiconductors are these
 

355
00:07:25,729 --> 00:07:28,059
conductors and semiconductors are these
ideas you can build these very simple

356
00:07:28,059 --> 00:07:28,069
ideas you can build these very simple
 

357
00:07:28,069 --> 00:07:30,369
ideas you can build these very simple
switches and you can put them on these

358
00:07:30,369 --> 00:07:30,379
switches and you can put them on these
 

359
00:07:30,379 --> 00:07:32,679
switches and you can put them on these
microchips and he made his observation

360
00:07:32,679 --> 00:07:32,689
microchips and he made his observation
 

361
00:07:32,689 --> 00:07:35,139
microchips and he made his observation
over 50 years ago he looked at a few

362
00:07:35,139 --> 00:07:35,149
over 50 years ago he looked at a few
 

363
00:07:35,149 --> 00:07:36,819
over 50 years ago he looked at a few
years and said I think what's going to

364
00:07:36,819 --> 00:07:36,829
years and said I think what's going to
 

365
00:07:36,829 --> 00:07:38,469
years and said I think what's going to
happen is the number of these little

366
00:07:38,469 --> 00:07:38,479
happen is the number of these little
 

367
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,109
happen is the number of these little
switches called transistors is going to

368
00:07:41,109 --> 00:07:41,119
switches called transistors is going to
 

369
00:07:41,119 --> 00:07:43,659
switches called transistors is going to
double every year for the next decade

370
00:07:43,659 --> 00:07:43,669
double every year for the next decade
 

371
00:07:43,669 --> 00:07:47,109
double every year for the next decade
and he said this in 1965 and in 1975 he

372
00:07:47,109 --> 00:07:47,119
and he said this in 1965 and in 1975 he
 

373
00:07:47,119 --> 00:07:49,509
and he said this in 1965 and in 1975 he
said well maybe he's gonna double every

374
00:07:49,509 --> 00:07:49,519
said well maybe he's gonna double every
 

375
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:52,439
said well maybe he's gonna double every
two years and that I would other people

376
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:52,449
two years and that I would other people
 

377
00:07:52,449 --> 00:07:56,289
two years and that I would other people
since named that Moore's Law guided the

378
00:07:56,289 --> 00:07:56,299
since named that Moore's Law guided the
 

379
00:07:56,299 --> 00:07:58,600
since named that Moore's Law guided the
industry and when Gordon Moore makes

380
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:58,610
industry and when Gordon Moore makes
 

381
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:02,919
industry and when Gordon Moore makes
that prediction he he wrote a paper back

382
00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:02,929
that prediction he he wrote a paper back
 

383
00:08:02,929 --> 00:08:06,189
that prediction he he wrote a paper back
in I think in the in the 70s and said

384
00:08:06,189 --> 00:08:06,199
in I think in the in the 70s and said
 

385
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:09,009
in I think in the in the 70s and said
not only did this going to happen he

386
00:08:09,009 --> 00:08:09,019
not only did this going to happen he
 

387
00:08:09,019 --> 00:08:10,449
not only did this going to happen he
wrote what would be the implications of

388
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:10,459
wrote what would be the implications of
 

389
00:08:10,459 --> 00:08:14,139
wrote what would be the implications of
that and in this article from 1965 he he

390
00:08:14,139 --> 00:08:14,149
that and in this article from 1965 he he
 

391
00:08:14,149 --> 00:08:17,350
that and in this article from 1965 he he
shows ideas like computers being in cars

392
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:17,360
shows ideas like computers being in cars
 

393
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,189
shows ideas like computers being in cars
and computers being in something that

394
00:08:21,189 --> 00:08:21,199
and computers being in something that
 

395
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,449
and computers being in something that
you would buy in the grocery store and

396
00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:22,459
you would buy in the grocery store and
 

397
00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:24,429
you would buy in the grocery store and
stuff like that so he kind of not only

398
00:08:24,429 --> 00:08:24,439
stuff like that so he kind of not only
 

399
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:26,979
stuff like that so he kind of not only
called his shot he called the

400
00:08:26,979 --> 00:08:26,989
called his shot he called the
 

401
00:08:26,989 --> 00:08:29,769
called his shot he called the
implications of it so if you were in in

402
00:08:29,769 --> 00:08:29,779
implications of it so if you were in in
 

403
00:08:29,779 --> 00:08:31,629
implications of it so if you were in in
the computing field and a few believed

404
00:08:31,629 --> 00:08:31,639
the computing field and a few believed
 

405
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:34,299
the computing field and a few believed
Moore's prediction he kind of said what

406
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:34,309
Moore's prediction he kind of said what
 

407
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:35,889
Moore's prediction he kind of said what
the what would be happening in the

408
00:08:35,889 --> 00:08:35,899
the what would be happening in the
 

409
00:08:35,899 --> 00:08:36,339
the what would be happening in the
future

410
00:08:36,339 --> 00:08:36,349
future
 

411
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:39,420
future
so so it's not kind of

412
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:39,430
so so it's not kind of
 

413
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:42,310
so so it's not kind of
it's at one sense this is what was

414
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:42,320
it's at one sense this is what was
 

415
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,100
it's at one sense this is what was
predicted and you could imagine it was

416
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:45,110
predicted and you could imagine it was
 

417
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,300
predicted and you could imagine it was
easily believed that Moore's law was

418
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:46,310
easily believed that Moore's law was
 

419
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:47,890
easily believed that Moore's law was
going to continue and so this would be

420
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:47,900
going to continue and so this would be
 

421
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,620
going to continue and so this would be
the implications on the other side there

422
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:50,630
the implications on the other side there
 

423
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,170
the implications on the other side there
are these shocking events in your life

424
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:53,180
are these shocking events in your life
 

425
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:57,820
are these shocking events in your life
like I remember driving in meriem across

426
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:57,830
like I remember driving in meriem across
 

427
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:00,280
like I remember driving in meriem across
the bay in San Francisco and seeing a

428
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:00,290
the bay in San Francisco and seeing a
 

429
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:03,610
the bay in San Francisco and seeing a
bulletin board at a local Civic Center

430
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:03,620
bulletin board at a local Civic Center
 

431
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:06,580

00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:26,480
writing on it so for the lay people is
 

449
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,300
writing on it so for the lay people is
like what the hell is going on here and

early days of the personal computer when
 

465
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,790
early days of the personal computer when
we started seeing advertisements in

we started seeing advertisements in
 

467
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,250
we started seeing advertisements in
magazines for personal computers like

Gordon Moore predicted it and you kind

474
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:54,740
Gordon Moore predicted it and you kind
 

475
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,320
Gordon Moore predicted it and you kind
of expected it to happen but when it

476
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:56,330
of expected it to happen but when it
 

477
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,970
of expected it to happen but when it
really hit and you saw it affecting

478
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:57,980
really hit and you saw it affecting
 

479
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:02,830
really hit and you saw it affecting
society it was it was shocking so maybe

480
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:02,840
society it was it was shocking so maybe
 

481
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,580
society it was it was shocking so maybe
taking a step back and looking both the

482
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:05,590
taking a step back and looking both the
 

483
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:07,390
taking a step back and looking both the
engineering and philosophical

484
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:07,400
engineering and philosophical
 

485
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,390
engineering and philosophical
perspective what what do you see as the

486
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:10,400
perspective what what do you see as the
 

487
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,580
perspective what what do you see as the
layers of abstraction in the computer do

488
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:12,590
layers of abstraction in the computer do
 

489
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:15,340
layers of abstraction in the computer do
you see a computer as a set of layers of

490
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:15,350
you see a computer as a set of layers of
 

491
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:17,320
you see a computer as a set of layers of
abstractions yeah and I think that's one

492
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:17,330
abstractions yeah and I think that's one
 

493
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:20,160
abstractions yeah and I think that's one
of the things that computer science

494
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:20,170
of the things that computer science
 

495
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:23,230
of the things that computer science
fundamentals is the these things are

496
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:23,240
fundamentals is the these things are
 

497
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,270
fundamentals is the these things are
really complicated in the way we cope

498
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:25,280
really complicated in the way we cope
 

499
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,520
really complicated in the way we cope
with complicated software and

500
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:27,530
with complicated software and
 

501
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:28,900
with complicated software and
complicated hardware is these layers of

502
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:28,910
complicated hardware is these layers of
 

503
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:31,980
complicated hardware is these layers of
abstraction and that simply means that

504
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:31,990
abstraction and that simply means that
 

505
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:35,740
abstraction and that simply means that
we you know suspend disbelief and

506
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:35,750
we you know suspend disbelief and
 

507
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:38,500
we you know suspend disbelief and
pretend that the only thing you know is

508
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:38,510
pretend that the only thing you know is
 

509
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:40,540
pretend that the only thing you know is
that layer and you don't know anything

510
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:40,550
that layer and you don't know anything
 

511
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,760
that layer and you don't know anything
about the layer below it and that's the

512
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:42,770
about the layer below it and that's the
 

513
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:44,500
about the layer below it and that's the
way we can make very complicated things

514
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:44,510
way we can make very complicated things
 

515
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:47,860
way we can make very complicated things
and probably it started with hardware

516
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:47,870
and probably it started with hardware
 

517
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:50,260
and probably it started with hardware
that's the way it was done but it's been

518
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:50,270
that's the way it was done but it's been
 

519
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:52,809
that's the way it was done but it's been
proven extremely useful and

520
00:10:52,809 --> 00:10:52,819
proven extremely useful and
 

521
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,129
proven extremely useful and
you know I would think in a modern

522
00:10:54,129 --> 00:10:54,139
you know I would think in a modern
 

523
00:10:54,139 --> 00:10:57,460
you know I would think in a modern
computer today there might be 10 or 20

00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:57,470
computer today there might be 10 or 20
 

525
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:59,650
computer today there might be 10 or 20
layers of abstraction and they're all

526
00:10:59,650 --> 00:10:59,660
layers of abstraction and they're all
 

527
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,090
layers of abstraction and they're all
trying to kind of enforce this contract

528
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:01,100
trying to kind of enforce this contract
 

529
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:04,689
trying to kind of enforce this contract
is all you know is this interface

530
00:11:04,689 --> 00:11:04,699
is all you know is this interface
 

531
00:11:04,699 --> 00:11:08,829
is all you know is this interface
there's a set of commands that you can

532
00:11:08,829 --> 00:11:08,839
there's a set of commands that you can
 

533
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:10,629
there's a set of commands that you can
allow to use and you stick to those

534
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:10,639
allow to use and you stick to those
 

535
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:11,949
allow to use and you stick to those
commands that we will faithfully execute

536
00:11:11,949 --> 00:11:11,959
commands that we will faithfully execute
 

537
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:14,199
commands that we will faithfully execute
that and it's like peeling the air

538
00:11:14,199 --> 00:11:14,209
that and it's like peeling the air
 

539
00:11:14,209 --> 00:11:16,779

you can keep peeling those layers you
 

549
00:11:28,489 --> 00:11:30,609
you can keep peeling those layers you
you take your first course and you might

550
00:11:30,609 --> 00:11:30,619
you take your first course and you might
 

551
00:11:30,619 --> 00:11:33,129
you take your first course and you might
learn to program in Python and then you

00:12:11,259 --> 00:12:11,269
years and recently in hardware there's
 

585
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:13,119

getting to be open sourced versions of

586
00:12:13,119 --> 00:12:13,129
getting to be open sourced versions of
 

587
00:12:13,129 --> 00:12:14,889
getting to be open sourced versions of
all of these things so what open source

588
00:12:14,889 --> 00:12:14,899
all of these things so what open source
 

589
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:18,039
all of these things so what open source
means is what the engineer the

590
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:18,049
means is what the engineer the
 

591
00:12:18,049 --> 00:12:22,509
means is what the engineer the
programmer designs it's not secret the

592
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:22,519
programmer designs it's not secret the

00:12:25,059 --> 00:12:25,069
belonging to a company it's up there on
 

595
00:12:25,069 --> 00:12:27,489
belonging to a company it's up there on
the World Wide Web so you can see it so

596
00:12:27,489 --> 00:12:27,499
the World Wide Web so you can see it so
 

597
00:12:27,499 --> 00:12:31,659
the World Wide Web so you can see it so
you can look at for lots of pieces of

00:12:31,659 --> 00:12:31,669
you can look at for lots of pieces of
 

599
00:12:31,669 --> 00:12:33,519
you can look at for lots of pieces of
software that you use you can see

600
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:33,529
software that you use you can see
 

601
00:12:33,529 --> 00:12:35,499
software that you use you can see
exactly what the programmer does if you

602
00:12:35,499 --> 00:12:35,509
exactly what the programmer does if you
 

603
00:12:35,509 --> 00:12:38,590
exactly what the programmer does if you
want to get involved that used to stop

604
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:38,600
want to get involved that used to stop
 

605
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,889
want to get involved that used to stop
at the hardware recently there's been an

606
00:12:41,889 --> 00:12:41,899
at the hardware recently there's been an
 

607
00:12:41,899 --> 00:12:44,919
at the hardware recently there's been an
efforts to make open-source hardware and

608
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:44,929
efforts to make open-source hardware and
 

609
00:12:44,929 --> 00:12:46,869
efforts to make open-source hardware and
those interfaces open so you can see

610
00:12:46,869 --> 00:12:46,879
those interfaces open so you can see
 

611
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:48,609
those interfaces open so you can see
that so instead of before you had to

612
00:12:48,609 --> 00:12:48,619
that so instead of before you had to
 

613
00:12:48,619 --> 00:12:49,749
that so instead of before you had to
stop at the hardware you can now start

614
00:12:49,749 --> 00:12:49,759
stop at the hardware you can now start
 

615
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:52,869
stop at the hardware you can now start
going layer by layer below that and see

616
00:12:52,869 --> 00:12:52,879
going layer by layer below that and see
 

617
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:54,639
going layer by layer below that and see
what's inside there so it's it's a

618
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:54,649
what's inside there so it's it's a
 

619
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:57,239
what's inside there so it's it's a
remarkable time that for the interested

620
00:12:57,239 --> 00:12:57,249
remarkable time that for the interested
 

621
00:12:57,249 --> 00:12:59,949
remarkable time that for the interested

00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:01,999
what's really going on and the computers
 

625
00:13:01,999 --> 00:13:04,419
what's really going on and the computers
that power everything that we see around

00:13:04,419 --> 00:13:04,429
that power everything that we see around
 

627
00:13:04,429 --> 00:13:06,639
that power everything that we see around
us are you thinking also

00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:06,649
us are you thinking also
 

629
00:13:06,649 --> 00:13:08,230
us are you thinking also
when you say open source at the hardware

630
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:08,240
when you say open source at the hardware
 

631
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,319
when you say open source at the hardware
level is this going to the design

632
00:13:11,319 --> 00:13:11,329
level is this going to the design
 

633
00:13:11,329 --> 00:13:14,139
level is this going to the design
architecture instruction set level or is

634
00:13:14,139 --> 00:13:14,149
architecture instruction set level or is
 

635
00:13:14,149 --> 00:13:19,210
architecture instruction set level or is

00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:19,220
it going to literally the the you know

00:13:26,149 --> 00:13:28,869
that's a six specialized a particular
domain or the general yeah so let's talk

644
00:13:28,869 --> 00:13:28,879
domain or the general yeah so let's talk
 

645
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:31,059
domain or the general yeah so let's talk
about that a little bit so when you get

646
00:13:31,059 --> 00:13:31,069
about that a little bit so when you get
 

647
00:13:31,069 --> 00:13:35,799
about that a little bit so when you get
down to the bottom layer of software the

648
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:35,809
down to the bottom layer of software the
 

649
00:13:35,809 --> 00:13:39,489
down to the bottom layer of software the
way software talks to hardware is in a

650
00:13:39,489 --> 00:13:39,499
way software talks to hardware is in a
 

651
00:13:39,499 --> 00:13:41,980
way software talks to hardware is in a
vocabulary and what we call that

652
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:41,990
vocabulary and what we call that
 

653
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:45,160
vocabulary and what we call that
vocabulary we call that the words of

654
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:45,170
vocabulary we call that the words of
 

655
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:47,530
vocabulary we call that the words of
that vocabulary called instructions in

656
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:47,540
that vocabulary called instructions in
 

657
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:50,169
that vocabulary called instructions in
the technical term for the vocabulary is

658
00:13:50,169 --> 00:13:50,179
the technical term for the vocabulary is
 

659
00:13:50,179 --> 00:13:51,280
the technical term for the vocabulary is
instruction set

660
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:51,290
instruction set
 

661
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:53,290
instruction set
so those instructions are likely we

662
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:53,300
so those instructions are likely we
 

663
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,699
so those instructions are likely we
talked about earlier that can be

664
00:13:54,699 --> 00:13:54,709
talked about earlier that can be
 

665
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:56,710
talked about earlier that can be
instructions like add subtract and

666
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:56,720
instructions like add subtract and
 

667
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,199
instructions like add subtract and
multiply divide there's instructions to

668
00:13:59,199 --> 00:13:59,209
multiply divide there's instructions to
 

669
00:13:59,209 --> 00:14:02,470
multiply divide there's instructions to
put data into memory which is called a

670
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:02,480
put data into memory which is called a
 

671
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,179
put data into memory which is called a
store instruction and to get data back

672
00:14:04,179 --> 00:14:04,189
store instruction and to get data back
 

673
00:14:04,189 --> 00:14:05,530
store instruction and to get data back
which is called the load instructions

674
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:05,540
which is called the load instructions
 

675
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:08,919
which is called the load instructions
and those simple instructions go back to

676
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:08,929
and those simple instructions go back to
 

677
00:14:08,929 --> 00:14:10,629
and those simple instructions go back to
the very dawn of computing in you know

678
00:14:10,629 --> 00:14:10,639
the very dawn of computing in you know
 

679
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,519
the very dawn of computing in you know
in 1950 the commercial commercial

680
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:12,529
in 1950 the commercial commercial
 

681
00:14:12,529 --> 00:14:14,889
in 1950 the commercial commercial
computer had these instructions so

682
00:14:14,889 --> 00:14:14,899
computer had these instructions so
 

683
00:14:14,899 --> 00:14:16,449
computer had these instructions so
that's the instruction set that we're

684
00:14:16,449 --> 00:14:16,459
that's the instruction set that we're
 

685
00:14:16,459 --> 00:14:19,989
that's the instruction set that we're
talking about so up until I'd say ten

686
00:14:19,989 --> 00:14:19,999
talking about so up until I'd say ten
 

687
00:14:19,999 --> 00:14:21,879
talking about so up until I'd say ten
years ago these instruction sets are all

688
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:21,889
years ago these instruction sets are all
 

689
00:14:21,889 --> 00:14:25,139
years ago these instruction sets are all
proprietary so a very popular one is

690
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:25,149
proprietary so a very popular one is

referred to as the x86 there have been a

698
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:35,870
referred to as the x86 there have been a
 

699
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:38,350
referred to as the x86 there have been a
sequence of ones that the first number

700
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:38,360
sequence of ones that the first number
 

701
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,669
sequence of ones that the first number
was called 8086

702
00:14:39,669 --> 00:14:39,679
was called 8086
 

703
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:41,259
was called 8086
and since then there's been a lot of

704
00:14:41,259 --> 00:14:41,269
and since then there's been a lot of
 

705
00:14:41,269 --> 00:14:43,419
and since then there's been a lot of
numbers but they all end in 86 so

706
00:14:43,419 --> 00:14:43,429
numbers but they all end in 86 so
 

707
00:14:43,429 --> 00:14:46,960
numbers but they all end in 86 so
there's then that kind of family of

there's then that kind of family of
 

709
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,579
there's then that kind of family of
instruction sets and that's proprietary

710
00:14:48,579 --> 00:14:48,589
instruction sets and that's proprietary

in early in my career we pioneered a way

734
00:15:22,439 --> 00:15:22,449
in early in my career we pioneered a way
 

735
00:15:22,449 --> 00:15:25,410
in early in my career we pioneered a way
to do of these vocabularies instruction

736
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:25,420
to do of these vocabularies instruction
 

737
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,119
to do of these vocabularies instruction
sets that was very controversial at the

738
00:15:27,119 --> 00:15:27,129
sets that was very controversial at the
 

739
00:15:27,129 --> 00:15:29,809
sets that was very controversial at the
time at the time in the 1980s

740
00:15:29,809 --> 00:15:29,819
time at the time in the 1980s
 

741
00:15:29,819 --> 00:15:32,119
time at the time in the 1980s
conventional wisdom was these

742
00:15:32,119 --> 00:15:32,129
conventional wisdom was these
 

743
00:15:32,129 --> 00:15:33,960
conventional wisdom was these
vocabularies instruction sets should

744
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:33,970
vocabularies instruction sets should
 

745
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:36,629
vocabularies instruction sets should
have you know powerful instructions so

746
00:15:36,629 --> 00:15:36,639
have you know powerful instructions so
 

747
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,299
have you know powerful instructions so
polysyllabic kind of words you can think

748
00:15:39,299 --> 00:15:39,309
polysyllabic kind of words you can think
 

749
00:15:39,309 --> 00:15:42,030
polysyllabic kind of words you can think
of that and and so that instead of just

750
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:42,040
of that and and so that instead of just
 

751
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,889
of that and and so that instead of just
add subtract and multiply they would

752
00:15:43,889 --> 00:15:43,899
add subtract and multiply they would
 

753
00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:47,610
add subtract and multiply they would
have polynomial vied or sort a list and

754
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:47,620
have polynomial vied or sort a list and
 

755
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:50,309
have polynomial vied or sort a list and
the hope was of those powerful

756
00:15:50,309 --> 00:15:50,319
the hope was of those powerful
 

757
00:15:50,319 --> 00:15:52,019
the hope was of those powerful
vocabularies that make it easier for

758
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:52,029
vocabularies that make it easier for
 

759
00:15:52,029 --> 00:15:56,220
vocabularies that make it easier for
software so we thought that didn't make

760
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:56,230
software so we thought that didn't make
 

761
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:58,350
software so we thought that didn't make
sense for microprocessors servers people

Moore is changing really fast we think

780
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:20,680
Moore is changing really fast we think
 

781
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:24,119
Moore is changing really fast we think
it's better to have a pretty simple set

782
00:16:24,119 --> 00:16:24,129
it's better to have a pretty simple set
 

783
00:16:24,129 --> 00:16:25,470
it's better to have a pretty simple set
of instructions reduce set of

00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:25,480
of instructions reduce set of
 

785
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:28,350
of instructions reduce set of
instructions that that would be a better

786
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:28,360
instructions that that would be a better

00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,819
instructions that that would be a better
way to build microprocessors since

00:16:29,819 --> 00:16:29,829
way to build microprocessors since

way to build microprocessors since
they're going to be changing so fast due

00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:31,360
they're going to be changing so fast due
 

791
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,480
they're going to be changing so fast due
to Moore's law and then we'll just use

792
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:33,490
to Moore's law and then we'll just use
 

793
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:38,730
to Moore's law and then we'll just use
standard software to cover the used

794
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:38,740

00:16:40,209 --> 00:16:42,720
generate more of those simple
instructions and one of the pieces of

798
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:42,730
instructions and one of the pieces of
 

799
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:44,669
instructions and one of the pieces of

00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:46,420
going between these layers of
 

803
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,660
going between these layers of
abstractions is called a compiler and it

basically translates it's a translator

806
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:50,769
basically translates it's a translator
 

807
00:16:50,769 --> 00:16:52,230
basically translates it's a translator
between levels we said the translator

808
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:52,240
between levels we said the translator
 

809
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,569
between levels we said the translator
will handle it so the technical question

810
00:16:54,569 --> 00:16:54,579
will handle it so the technical question
 

811
00:16:54,579 --> 00:16:58,739
will handle it so the technical question
was well since there are these reduced

812
00:16:58,739 --> 00:16:58,749
was well since there are these reduced
 

813
00:16:58,749 --> 00:17:00,509
was well since there are these reduced
instructions you have to execute more of

814
00:17:00,509 --> 00:17:00,519
instructions you have to execute more of
 

815
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:03,090
instructions you have to execute more of
them yeah that's right but maybe they

816
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:03,100
them yeah that's right but maybe they
 

817
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,649
them yeah that's right but maybe they
execute them faster yeah that's right

818
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:04,659
execute them faster yeah that's right
 

819
00:17:04,659 --> 00:17:06,269
execute them faster yeah that's right
there's simpler so they could go faster

820
00:17:06,269 --> 00:17:06,279
there's simpler so they could go faster
 

821
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:07,529
there's simpler so they could go faster
but you have to do more of them so

822
00:17:07,529 --> 00:17:07,539
but you have to do more of them so
 

823
00:17:07,539 --> 00:17:09,720
but you have to do more of them so
what's what's that trade-off look like

824
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:09,730
what's what's that trade-off look like
 

825
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:12,210
what's what's that trade-off look like
and it ended up that we ended up

826
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:12,220
and it ended up that we ended up
 

827
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:15,179
and it ended up that we ended up
executing maybe 50 percent more

828
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:15,189
executing maybe 50 percent more
 

829
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:17,610
executing maybe 50 percent more
instructions maybe 1/3 more instructions

830
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:17,620
instructions maybe 1/3 more instructions
 

831
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:20,639
instructions maybe 1/3 more instructions
but they ran four times faster so so

832
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:20,649
but they ran four times faster so so
 

833
00:17:20,649 --> 00:17:23,309
but they ran four times faster so so
this risk controversial risk ideas

834
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:23,319
this risk controversial risk ideas
 

835
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:25,559
this risk controversial risk ideas
proved to be maybe factors of three or

836
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:25,569
proved to be maybe factors of three or
 

837
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:28,919
proved to be maybe factors of three or
four better I love that this idea was

838
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:28,929
four better I love that this idea was
 

839
00:17:28,929 --> 00:17:30,630
four better I love that this idea was
controversial and

840
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:30,640
controversial and
 

841
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,940
controversial and
most kind of like a rebellious so that's

most kind of like a rebellious so that's
 

843
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:35,540
most kind of like a rebellious so that's

00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,980
gonna make software worse by making
death instructions simpler and they're

00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:07,900
fierce debates at several conferences in
 

869
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,920
fierce debates at several conferences in
the 1980s and then later in the eighties

870
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:10,930
the 1980s and then later in the eighties
 

871
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:13,770
the 1980s and then later in the eighties
that kind of settled to these benefits

872
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:13,780
that kind of settled to these benefits
 

873
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:16,260
that kind of settled to these benefits
it's not completely intuitive to me why

874
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:16,270
it's not completely intuitive to me why
 

875
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:20,070
it's not completely intuitive to me why
risk has for the most part one yes so

876
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:20,080
risk has for the most part one yes so
 

877
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,620
risk has for the most part one yes so
why do that happen yeah yeah and maybe I

878
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:22,630
why do that happen yeah yeah and maybe I
 

879
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:23,940
why do that happen yeah yeah and maybe I
can sort of say a bunch of dumb things

880
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:23,950
can sort of say a bunch of dumb things
 

881
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:26,310
can sort of say a bunch of dumb things
that could lay the land for further

882
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:26,320
that could lay the land for further
 

883
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,730
that could lay the land for further
commentary so to me and this is a this

884
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:29,740
commentary so to me and this is a this
 

885
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,050
commentary so to me and this is a this
is kind of interesting thing if you look

886
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:31,060
is kind of interesting thing if you look
 

887
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,780
is kind of interesting thing if you look
at C++ was just see with modern

888
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:33,790
at C++ was just see with modern
 

889
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:36,720
at C++ was just see with modern
compilers you really could write faster

890
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:36,730
compilers you really could write faster
 

891
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:40,500
compilers you really could write faster
code with C++ so relying on the compiler

892
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:40,510
code with C++ so relying on the compiler
 

893
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:43,260
code with C++ so relying on the compiler
to reduce your complicated code into

894
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:43,270
to reduce your complicated code into
 

895
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:45,440
to reduce your complicated code into
something simple and fast so to me

896
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:45,450
something simple and fast so to me
 

897
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:49,440
something simple and fast so to me
comparing risk maybe this is a dumb

898
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:49,450
comparing risk maybe this is a dumb
 

899
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:53,460
comparing risk maybe this is a dumb
question but why is it that focusing the

900
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:53,470
question but why is it that focusing the
 

901
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:55,230
question but why is it that focusing the
definition the design of the instruction

versus coming up with like I said a ton

908
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:06,880
versus coming up with like I said a ton
 

909
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,680
versus coming up with like I said a ton
of complicated instructions then over

910
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:10,690
of complicated instructions then over
 

911
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:14,070
of complicated instructions then over
time you know years maybe decades you

912
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:14,080
time you know years maybe decades you
 

913
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,780
time you know years maybe decades you
come up with compilers that can reduce

914
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:15,790
come up with compilers that can reduce
 

915
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:18,870
come up with compilers that can reduce
those into simple instructions for you

916
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:18,880
those into simple instructions for you
 

917
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,030
those into simple instructions for you
yeah some let's try and split that into

918
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:21,040
yeah some let's try and split that into
 

919
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:25,500
yeah some let's try and split that into
two pieces so if the compiler can do

920
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:25,510
two pieces so if the compiler can do
 

921
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:27,720
two pieces so if the compiler can do
that for you if the pilot can take you

922
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:27,730
that for you if the pilot can take you
 

923
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:30,480
that for you if the pilot can take you
know a complicated program and produce

924
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:30,490
know a complicated program and produce
 

925
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:34,650
know a complicated program and produce
simpler instructions then the programmer

926
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:34,660
simpler instructions then the programmer
 

927
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,870
simpler instructions then the programmer
doesn't care right programmer yeah yeah

928
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:36,880
doesn't care right programmer yeah yeah
 

929
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,480
doesn't care right programmer yeah yeah
I don't care just how how fast is the

930
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:39,490
I don't care just how how fast is the
 

931
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:40,890
I don't care just how how fast is the
computer I'm using how much does it cost

932
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:40,900
computer I'm using how much does it cost
 

933
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,590
computer I'm using how much does it cost
and so what we what

934
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:43,600
and so what we what
 

935
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,130
and so what we what
and kind of in the software industry is

936
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:46,140
and kind of in the software industry is
 

937
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:49,140
and kind of in the software industry is
right around before the 1980s critical

938
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:49,150
right around before the 1980s critical
 

939
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:51,029
right around before the 1980s critical
pieces of software we're still written

computer can understand so they were
writing add subtract multiply you know

954
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:09,520
writing add subtract multiply you know
 

955
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,539
writing add subtract multiply you know
instructions it's very tedious but the

956
00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:12,549
instructions it's very tedious but the
 

957
00:20:12,549 --> 00:20:14,909
instructions it's very tedious but the
belief was to write this lowest level of

958
00:20:14,909 --> 00:20:14,919
belief was to write this lowest level of
 

959
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:17,789
belief was to write this lowest level of
software that the people use which are

960
00:20:17,789 --> 00:20:17,799
software that the people use which are
 

961
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,620
software that the people use which are
called operating systems they had to be

962
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:19,630
called operating systems they had to be
 

963
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:21,299
called operating systems they had to be
written in assembly language because

964
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:21,309
written in assembly language because
 

965
00:20:21,309 --> 00:20:23,010
written in assembly language because
these high-level languages were just too

966
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:23,020
these high-level languages were just too
 

967
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:26,100
these high-level languages were just too
inefficient they were too slow or the

968
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:26,110
inefficient they were too slow or the
 

969
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:29,909
inefficient they were too slow or the
the programs would be too big so that

970
00:20:29,909 --> 00:20:29,919
the programs would be too big so that
 

971
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:33,210
the programs would be too big so that
changed with a famous operating system

972
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:33,220
changed with a famous operating system
 

973
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,940
changed with a famous operating system
called UNIX which is kind of the

974
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:34,950
called UNIX which is kind of the
 

975
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:37,200
called UNIX which is kind of the
grandfather of all the operating systems

976
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:37,210
grandfather of all the operating systems
 

977
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:40,590
grandfather of all the operating systems
today so the UNIX demonstrated that you

978
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:40,600
today so the UNIX demonstrated that you
 

979
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,990
today so the UNIX demonstrated that you
could write something as complicated as

980
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:43,000
could write something as complicated as
 

981
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,140
could write something as complicated as
an operating system in a language like C

982
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:45,150
an operating system in a language like C
 

983
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:49,830
an operating system in a language like C
so once that was true then that meant we

984
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:49,840
so once that was true then that meant we
 

985
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,350
so once that was true then that meant we
could hide the instruction set from the

986
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:52,360
could hide the instruction set from the
 

987
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,169
could hide the instruction set from the
programmer and so that meant then it

988
00:20:55,169 --> 00:20:55,179
programmer and so that meant then it
 

989
00:20:55,179 --> 00:20:57,659
programmer and so that meant then it
didn't really matter the programmer

990
00:20:57,659 --> 00:20:57,669
didn't really matter the programmer
 

991
00:20:57,669 --> 00:20:59,850
didn't really matter the programmer
didn't have to write lots of these

992
00:20:59,850 --> 00:20:59,860
didn't have to write lots of these
 

993
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,409
didn't have to write lots of these
simple instructions so that was up to

994
00:21:01,409 --> 00:21:01,419
simple instructions so that was up to
 

995
00:21:01,419 --> 00:21:03,090
simple instructions so that was up to
the compiler so that was part of our

996
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:03,100
the compiler so that was part of our
 

997
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,490
the compiler so that was part of our
arguments for risk is if you were still

998
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:05,500
arguments for risk is if you were still
 

999
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,960
arguments for risk is if you were still
writing assembly languages maybe a

1000
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:06,970
writing assembly languages maybe a
 

1001
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:09,720
writing assembly languages maybe a
better case for sis constructions but if

1002
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:09,730
better case for sis constructions but if
 

1003
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:11,940
better case for sis constructions but if
the compiler can do that it's gonna be

1004
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:11,950
the compiler can do that it's gonna be
 

1005
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:14,909
the compiler can do that it's gonna be
you know that's done once the computer

1006
00:21:14,909 --> 00:21:14,919
you know that's done once the computer
 

1007
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:16,470
you know that's done once the computer
translates it once and then every time

1008
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:16,480
translates it once and then every time
 

1009
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,450
translates it once and then every time
you run the program it runs that this

1010
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:18,460
you run the program it runs that this
 

1011
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,659
you run the program it runs that this
this potentially simpler instructions

1012
00:21:20,659 --> 00:21:20,669
this potentially simpler instructions
 

1013
00:21:20,669 --> 00:21:24,270
this potentially simpler instructions
and so that that was the debate right is

1014
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:24,280
and so that that was the debate right is
 

1015
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,220
and so that that was the debate right is
because and people would acknowledge

1016
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:26,230
because and people would acknowledge
 

1017
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:29,520
because and people would acknowledge
that these simpler instructions could

1018
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:29,530
that these simpler instructions could
 

1019
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:31,409
that these simpler instructions could
lead to a faster computer you can think

1020
00:21:31,409 --> 00:21:31,419
lead to a faster computer you can think
 

1021
00:21:31,419 --> 00:21:33,779
lead to a faster computer you can think
of mono syllabic constructions you could

1022
00:21:33,779 --> 00:21:33,789
of mono syllabic constructions you could
 

1023
00:21:33,789 --> 00:21:34,860
of mono syllabic constructions you could
say them you know if you think of

1024
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:34,870
say them you know if you think of
 

1025
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:36,990
say them you know if you think of
reading you probably read them faster or

1026
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:37,000
reading you probably read them faster or
 

1027
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
reading you probably read them faster or
say them faster than long instructions

1028
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,010
say them faster than long instructions
 

1029
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:40,950
say them faster than long instructions
the same thing that analogy works pretty

1030
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:40,960
the same thing that analogy works pretty
 

1031
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,289
the same thing that analogy works pretty
well for hardware and as long as you

1032
00:21:43,289 --> 00:21:43,299
well for hardware and as long as you
 

1033
00:21:43,299 --> 00:21:45,480
well for hardware and as long as you
didn't have to read a lot more of those

1034
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:45,490
didn't have to read a lot more of those
 

1035
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:47,220
didn't have to read a lot more of those
instructions you could win so that's

1036
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:47,230
instructions you could win so that's
 

1037
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:49,440
instructions you could win so that's
that's kind of that's the basic idea for

1038
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:49,450
that's kind of that's the basic idea for
 

1039
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:52,110
that's kind of that's the basic idea for
risk but it's interesting that the in

1040
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:52,120
risk but it's interesting that the in
 

1041
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,419
risk but it's interesting that the in
that discussion of UNIX to see that

1042
00:21:54,419 --> 00:21:54,429
that discussion of UNIX to see that
 

1043
00:21:54,429 --> 00:21:56,200
that discussion of UNIX to see that
there's only one step

1044
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:56,210
there's only one step
 

1045
00:21:56,210 --> 00:22:00,250
there's only one step
of levels of abstraction from the code

1046
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:00,260
of levels of abstraction from the code
 

1047
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,560
of levels of abstraction from the code
that's really the closest to the machine

1048
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:02,570
that's really the closest to the machine
 

1049
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:05,680
that's really the closest to the machine
to the code that's written by human it's

1050
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:05,690
to the code that's written by human it's
 

1051
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:08,910
to the code that's written by human it's
uh at least to me again perhaps a dumb

1052
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:08,920
uh at least to me again perhaps a dumb
 

1053
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,170
uh at least to me again perhaps a dumb
intuition but it feels like there might

1054
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:11,180
intuition but it feels like there might
 

1055
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:14,170
intuition but it feels like there might
have been more layers sort of different

1056
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:14,180
have been more layers sort of different
 

1057
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:16,360
have been more layers sort of different
kinds of humans stacked as well of each

1058
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:16,370
kinds of humans stacked as well of each
 

1059
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:19,450
kinds of humans stacked as well of each
other so what's true and not true about

1060
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:19,460
other so what's true and not true about
 

1061
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:24,760
other so what's true and not true about
what you said is several of the layers

1062
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:24,770
what you said is several of the layers
 

1063
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:29,740
what you said is several of the layers
of software like so the if you hear two

1064
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:29,750
of software like so the if you hear two
 

1065
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,990
of software like so the if you hear two
layers would be suppose we just talked

1066
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:32,000
layers would be suppose we just talked
 

1067
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,100
layers would be suppose we just talked
about two layers that would be the

1068
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:33,110
about two layers that would be the
 

1069
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:35,680
about two layers that would be the
operating system like you get from from

1070
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:35,690
operating system like you get from from
 

1071
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:39,250
operating system like you get from from
Microsoft or from Apple like iOS or the

1072
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:39,260
Microsoft or from Apple like iOS or the
 

1073
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:41,890
Microsoft or from Apple like iOS or the
Windows operating system and let's say

1074
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:41,900
Windows operating system and let's say
 

1075
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,540
Windows operating system and let's say
applications that run on top of it like

1076
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:43,550
applications that run on top of it like
 

1077
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:48,430
applications that run on top of it like
Word or Excel so both the operating

1078
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:48,440
Word or Excel so both the operating
 

1079
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:51,370
Word or Excel so both the operating
system could be written in C and the

1080
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:51,380
system could be written in C and the
 

1081
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,620
system could be written in C and the
application could be written in C so but

1082
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:53,630
application could be written in C so but
 

1083
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:56,260
application could be written in C so but
you could construct those two layers and

1084
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:56,270
you could construct those two layers and
 

1085
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:58,870
you could construct those two layers and
the applications absolutely do call upon

1086
00:22:58,870 --> 00:22:58,880
the applications absolutely do call upon
 

1087
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,990
the applications absolutely do call upon
the operating system and the change was

1088
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:02,000
the operating system and the change was
 

1089
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,490
the operating system and the change was
that both of them could be written in

1090
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:03,500
that both of them could be written in
 

1091
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,800
that both of them could be written in
higher-level languages so it's one step

1092
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:05,810
higher-level languages so it's one step
 

1093
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:07,870
higher-level languages so it's one step
of a translation but you can still build

1094
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:07,880
of a translation but you can still build
 

1095
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,840
of a translation but you can still build
many layers of abstraction of software

1096
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:10,850
many layers of abstraction of software
 

1097
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:12,910
many layers of abstraction of software
on top of that and that's how how things

1098
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:12,920
on top of that and that's how how things
 

1099
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:17,950
on top of that and that's how how things
are done today so still today many of

1100
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:17,960
are done today so still today many of
 

1101
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,350
are done today so still today many of
the layers that you'll you'll deep deal

1102
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:20,360
the layers that you'll you'll deep deal
 

1103
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,600
the layers that you'll you'll deep deal
with you may deal with debuggers you may

1104
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:22,610
with you may deal with debuggers you may
 

1105
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:27,340
with you may deal with debuggers you may
deal with linkers there's libraries many

1106
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:27,350
deal with linkers there's libraries many
 

1107
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:30,880
deal with linkers there's libraries many
of those today will be written in c++

1108
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:30,890
of those today will be written in c++
 

1109
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:34,390
of those today will be written in c++
say even though that language is pretty

1110
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:34,400
say even though that language is pretty
 

1111
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,940
say even though that language is pretty
ancient and even the Python interpreter

1112
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:36,950
ancient and even the Python interpreter
 

1113
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:40,990
ancient and even the Python interpreter
is probably written in C or C++ so lots

1114
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:41,000
is probably written in C or C++ so lots
 

1115
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,090
is probably written in C or C++ so lots
of layers there are probably written in

1116
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:43,100
of layers there are probably written in
 

1117
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:46,570
of layers there are probably written in
these some old fashioned efficient

1118
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:46,580
these some old fashioned efficient
 

1119
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:49,840
these some old fashioned efficient
languages that still take one step to

1120
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:49,850
languages that still take one step to
 

1121
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:54,010
languages that still take one step to
produce these instructions produce RISC

1122
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:54,020
produce these instructions produce RISC
 

1123
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:56,440
produce these instructions produce RISC
instructions but they're composed each

layer of software invokes one another

1126
00:23:59,140 --> 00:23:59,150
layer of software invokes one another
 

1127
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:01,570
layer of software invokes one another
through these interfaces and you can get

1128
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:01,580
through these interfaces and you can get
 

1129
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:04,570
through these interfaces and you can get
ten layers of software that way so in

1130
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:04,580
ten layers of software that way so in
 

1131
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,430
ten layers of software that way so in
general the risk was developed here

Berkeley it was kind of the three places

1134
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:09,620
Berkeley it was kind of the three places
 

1135
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,240
Berkeley it was kind of the three places
that were

1136
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:10,250
that were
 

1137
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:13,480
that were
these radicals that advocated for this

1138
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:13,490
these radicals that advocated for this
 

1139
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:15,130
these radicals that advocated for this
against the rest of community where IBM

Berkeley and Stanford you're one of

1142
00:24:18,909 --> 00:24:18,919
Berkeley and Stanford you're one of
 

1143
00:24:18,919 --> 00:24:23,830
Berkeley and Stanford you're one of
these radicals and how radical did you

1144
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:23,840
these radicals and how radical did you
 

1145
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,419
these radicals and how radical did you
feel how confident did you feel how

1146
00:24:27,419 --> 00:24:27,429
feel how confident did you feel how
 

1147
00:24:27,429 --> 00:24:30,850
feel how confident did you feel how
doubtful were you that risk might be the

1148
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:30,860
doubtful were you that risk might be the
 

1149
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,470
doubtful were you that risk might be the
right approach because it may you can

1150
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:32,480
right approach because it may you can
 

1151
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,870

also Intuit that is kind of taking a

1152
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:34,880
also Intuit that is kind of taking a
 

1153
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,299
also Intuit that is kind of taking a
step back into simplicity not forward

1154
00:24:37,299 --> 00:24:37,309
step back into simplicity not forward
 

1155
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:40,270
step back into simplicity not forward
into simplicity yeah no it was easy to

1156
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:40,280
into simplicity yeah no it was easy to
 

1157
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:43,270
into simplicity yeah no it was easy to
make yeah it was easy to make the

1158
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:43,280
make yeah it was easy to make the
 

1159
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,760
make yeah it was easy to make the
argument against it well this was my

1160
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:45,770
argument against it well this was my
 

1161
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:48,130
argument against it well this was my
colleague John Hennessy at Stanford and

1162
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:48,140
colleague John Hennessy at Stanford and
 

1163
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:49,950
colleague John Hennessy at Stanford and
I we were both assistant professors and

1164
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:49,960
I we were both assistant professors and
 

1165
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:53,860
I we were both assistant professors and
for me I just believed in the power of

1166
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:53,870
for me I just believed in the power of
 

1167
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:56,470
for me I just believed in the power of
our ideas I thought what we were saying

1168
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:56,480
our ideas I thought what we were saying
 

1169
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,060
our ideas I thought what we were saying
made sense Moore's Law is going to move

1170
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:58,070
made sense Moore's Law is going to move
 

1171
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:01,060
made sense Moore's Law is going to move
fast the other thing that I didn't

1172
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:01,070
fast the other thing that I didn't
 

1173
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:03,430
fast the other thing that I didn't
mention is one of the surprises of these

1174
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:03,440
mention is one of the surprises of these
 

1175
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,039
mention is one of the surprises of these
complex instruction sets you could

1176
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:06,049
complex instruction sets you could
 

1177
00:25:06,049 --> 00:25:07,750
complex instruction sets you could
certainly write these complex

1178
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:07,760
certainly write these complex
 

1179
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,130
certainly write these complex
instructions if the programmer is

1180
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:09,140
instructions if the programmer is
 

1181
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:11,500
instructions if the programmer is
writing them in themselves it turned out

1182
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:11,510
writing them in themselves it turned out
 

1183
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,930
writing them in themselves it turned out
to be kind of difficult for the compiler

1184
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:13,940
to be kind of difficult for the compiler
 

1185
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,730
to be kind of difficult for the compiler
to generate those complex instructions

1186
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:15,740
to generate those complex instructions
 

1187
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,919
to generate those complex instructions
kind of ironically you'd have to find

1188
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:17,929
kind of ironically you'd have to find
 

1189
00:25:17,929 --> 00:25:20,289
kind of ironically you'd have to find
the right circumstances that that just

1190
00:25:20,289 --> 00:25:20,299
the right circumstances that that just
 

1191
00:25:20,299 --> 00:25:22,029
the right circumstances that that just
exactly fit this complex instruction it

1192
00:25:22,029 --> 00:25:22,039
exactly fit this complex instruction it
 

1193
00:25:22,039 --> 00:25:23,470
exactly fit this complex instruction it
was actually easier for the compiler to

1194
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:23,480
was actually easier for the compiler to
 

1195
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,649
was actually easier for the compiler to
generate these simple instructions so

1196
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:25,659
generate these simple instructions so
 

1197
00:25:25,659 --> 00:25:28,390
generate these simple instructions so
not only did these complex instructions

1198
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:28,400
not only did these complex instructions
 

1199
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,520
not only did these complex instructions
make the hard work more difficult to

1200
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:30,530
make the hard work more difficult to
 

1201
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:33,010
make the hard work more difficult to
build often the compiler wouldn't even

1202
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:33,020
build often the compiler wouldn't even
 

1203
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:36,730
build often the compiler wouldn't even
use them and so it's harder to build the

1204
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:36,740
use them and so it's harder to build the
 

1205
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:39,279
use them and so it's harder to build the
compiler doesn't use them that much the

1206
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:39,289
compiler doesn't use them that much the
 

1207
00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:40,630
compiler doesn't use them that much the
simple instructions go better with

1208
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:40,640
simple instructions go better with
 

1209
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,789
simple instructions go better with
Moore's Law that's you know the number

1210
00:25:42,789 --> 00:25:42,799
Moore's Law that's you know the number
 

1211
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,890
Moore's Law that's you know the number
of transistors is doubling every every

1212
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:44,900
of transistors is doubling every every
 

1213
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,720
of transistors is doubling every every
two years so we're gonna have you know

1214
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:46,730
two years so we're gonna have you know
 

1215
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:49,060
two years so we're gonna have you know
the you want to reduce the time to

1216
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:49,070
the you want to reduce the time to
 

1217
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:50,620
the you want to reduce the time to
design the microprocessor that may be

1218
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:50,630
design the microprocessor that may be
 

1219
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:52,029
design the microprocessor that may be
more important than these number

1220
00:25:52,029 --> 00:25:52,039
more important than these number
 

1221
00:25:52,039 --> 00:25:54,730
more important than these number
instructions so I think we believed in

1222
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:54,740
instructions so I think we believed in
 

1223
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:58,390
instructions so I think we believed in
the that we were right that this was the

1224
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:58,400
the that we were right that this was the
 

1225
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,970
the that we were right that this was the
best idea then the question became in

1226
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:00,980
best idea then the question became in
 

1227
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,560
best idea then the question became in
these debates well yeah that's a good

1228
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:02,570
these debates well yeah that's a good
 

1229
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:05,140
these debates well yeah that's a good
technical idea but in the business world

1230
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:05,150
technical idea but in the business world
 

1231
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:06,909
technical idea but in the business world
this doesn't matter there's other things

1232
00:26:06,909 --> 00:26:06,919
this doesn't matter there's other things
 

1233
00:26:06,919 --> 00:26:10,570
this doesn't matter there's other things
that matter it's like arguing that if

1234
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:10,580
that matter it's like arguing that if
 

1235
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:12,460
that matter it's like arguing that if
there's a standard with the railroad

1236
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:12,470
there's a standard with the railroad
 

1237
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:14,649
there's a standard with the railroad
tracks and you've come up with a better

1238
00:26:14,649 --> 00:26:14,659
tracks and you've come up with a better
 

1239
00:26:14,659 --> 00:26:16,539
tracks and you've come up with a better
with but the whole world has covered

1240
00:26:16,539 --> 00:26:16,549
with but the whole world has covered
 

1241
00:26:16,549 --> 00:26:18,970
with but the whole world has covered
railroad tracks so you'll your ideas

1242
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:18,980
railroad tracks so you'll your ideas
 

1243
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:21,330
railroad tracks so you'll your ideas
have no chance of success

1244
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:21,340
have no chance of success
 

1245
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,739
have no chance of success
commercial success it was technically

1246
00:26:22,739 --> 00:26:22,749
commercial success it was technically
 

1247
00:26:22,749 --> 00:26:24,509
commercial success it was technically
right but commercially it'll be

1248
00:26:24,509 --> 00:26:24,519
right but commercially it'll be
 

1249
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:26,879
right but commercially it'll be
insignificant yeah this it's kind of sad

1250
00:26:26,879 --> 00:26:26,889
insignificant yeah this it's kind of sad
 

1251
00:26:26,889 --> 00:26:29,430
insignificant yeah this it's kind of sad
that this world the history of human

1252
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:29,440
that this world the history of human
 

1253
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,570
that this world the history of human
civilization is full of good ideas that

1254
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:32,580
civilization is full of good ideas that
 

1255
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,919
civilization is full of good ideas that
lost because somebody else came along

1256
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:34,929
lost because somebody else came along
 

1257
00:26:34,929 --> 00:26:38,460
lost because somebody else came along
first with a worse idea and it's good

1258
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:38,470
first with a worse idea and it's good
 

1259
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:39,989
first with a worse idea and it's good
that in the computing world at least

1260
00:26:39,989 --> 00:26:39,999
that in the computing world at least
 

1261
00:26:39,999 --> 00:26:41,999
that in the computing world at least
some of these have well well you could

1262
00:26:41,999 --> 00:26:42,009
some of these have well well you could
 

1263
00:26:42,009 --> 00:26:43,980
some of these have well well you could
are I mean it's probably still sisk

1264
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:43,990
are I mean it's probably still sisk
 

1265
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:47,970
are I mean it's probably still sisk
people that say yeah still are but and

1266
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:47,980
people that say yeah still are but and
 

1267
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,590
people that say yeah still are but and
what happened was what was interesting

1268
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:49,600
what happened was what was interesting
 

1269
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,220
what happened was what was interesting
Intel a bunch of the system companies

1270
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:53,230
Intel a bunch of the system companies
 

1271
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:55,609
Intel a bunch of the system companies
with Sisk instruction sets of vocabulary

1272
00:26:55,609 --> 00:26:55,619
with Sisk instruction sets of vocabulary
 

1273
00:26:55,619 --> 00:26:59,100
with Sisk instruction sets of vocabulary
they gave up but not Intel what Intel

1274
00:26:59,100 --> 00:26:59,110
they gave up but not Intel what Intel
 

1275
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:02,659
they gave up but not Intel what Intel
did to its credit because Intel's

1276
00:27:02,659 --> 00:27:02,669
did to its credit because Intel's
 

1277
00:27:02,669 --> 00:27:06,389
did to its credit because Intel's
vocabulary was in the in the personal

1278
00:27:06,389 --> 00:27:06,399
vocabulary was in the in the personal
 

1279
00:27:06,399 --> 00:27:08,489
vocabulary was in the in the personal
computer and so that was a very valuable

1280
00:27:08,489 --> 00:27:08,499
computer and so that was a very valuable
 

1281
00:27:08,499 --> 00:27:10,680
computer and so that was a very valuable
vocabulary because the way we distribute

1282
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:10,690
vocabulary because the way we distribute
 

1283
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:14,039
vocabulary because the way we distribute
software is in those actual instructions

1284
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:14,049
software is in those actual instructions
 

1285
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:15,480
software is in those actual instructions
it's in the instructions of that

1286
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:15,490
it's in the instructions of that
 

1287
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:18,239
it's in the instructions of that
instruction set so they then you don't

1288
00:27:18,239 --> 00:27:18,249
instruction set so they then you don't
 

1289
00:27:18,249 --> 00:27:19,560
instruction set so they then you don't
get that source code what the

1290
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:19,570
get that source code what the
 

1291
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:22,049
get that source code what the
programmers wrote you get after it's

1292
00:27:22,049 --> 00:27:22,059
programmers wrote you get after it's
 

1293
00:27:22,059 --> 00:27:23,789
programmers wrote you get after it's
been translated into the last level

1294
00:27:23,789 --> 00:27:23,799
been translated into the last level
 

1295
00:27:23,799 --> 00:27:26,159
been translated into the last level
that's if you were to get a floppy disk

1296
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:26,169
that's if you were to get a floppy disk
 

1297
00:27:26,169 --> 00:27:28,019
that's if you were to get a floppy disk
or download software it's in the

1298
00:27:28,019 --> 00:27:28,029
or download software it's in the
 

1299
00:27:28,029 --> 00:27:30,330
or download software it's in the
instructions that instruction set so the

1300
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:30,340
instructions that instruction set so the
 

1301
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:33,690
instructions that instruction set so the
x86 instruction set was very valuable so

1302
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:33,700
x86 instruction set was very valuable so
 

1303
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:36,840
x86 instruction set was very valuable so
what Intel did cleverly and amazingly is

1304
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:36,850
what Intel did cleverly and amazingly is
 

1305
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:40,350
what Intel did cleverly and amazingly is
they had their chips in hardware do a

1306
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:40,360
they had their chips in hardware do a
 

1307
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,779
they had their chips in hardware do a
translation step they would take these

1308
00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:42,789
translation step they would take these
 

1309
00:27:42,789 --> 00:27:44,789
translation step they would take these
complex instructions and translate them

1310
00:27:44,789 --> 00:27:44,799
complex instructions and translate them
 

1311
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:46,470
complex instructions and translate them
into essentially in RISC instructions in

1312
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:46,480
into essentially in RISC instructions in
 

1313
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,159
into essentially in RISC instructions in
Hardware on the fly you know at at

1314
00:27:49,159 --> 00:27:49,169
Hardware on the fly you know at at
 

1315
00:27:49,169 --> 00:27:52,289
Hardware on the fly you know at at
gigahertz clock speeds and then any good

1316
00:27:52,289 --> 00:27:52,299
gigahertz clock speeds and then any good
 

1317
00:27:52,299 --> 00:27:54,480

idea that risk people had they could use

1318
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:54,490
idea that risk people had they could use
 

1319
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:56,549
idea that risk people had they could use
and they could still be compatible with

00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:56,559
and they could still be compatible with
 

1321
00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:00,590
and they could still be compatible with
us with this really valuable PC software

1322
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:00,600
us with this really valuable PC software
 

1323
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,749

software base and which also had very

1324
00:28:03,749 --> 00:28:03,759
software base and which also had very
 

1325
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:05,430

high volumes you know a hundred million

1326
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:05,440
high volumes you know a hundred million
 

1327
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,879
high volumes you know a hundred million
personal computers per year so the sisk

1328
00:28:08,879 --> 00:28:08,889
personal computers per year so the sisk
 

1329
00:28:08,889 --> 00:28:11,580
personal computers per year so the sisk
architecture in the business world was

1330
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:11,590
architecture in the business world was
 

1331
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:17,970
architecture in the business world was
actually one in in this PC era so just

1332
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:17,980
actually one in in this PC era so just
 

1333
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:21,810
actually one in in this PC era so just
going back to the the time of designing

1334
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:21,820
going back to the the time of designing
 

1335
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:26,269
going back to the the time of designing
risk when you design an instruction set

1336
00:28:26,269 --> 00:28:26,279
risk when you design an instruction set
 

1337
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:27,930
risk when you design an instruction set
architecture do you think like a

1338
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:27,940
architecture do you think like a
 

1339
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,720

programmer do you think like a

1340
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:29,730
programmer do you think like a
 

1341
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:32,789
programmer do you think like a
microprocessor engineer do you think

1342
00:28:32,789 --> 00:28:32,799
microprocessor engineer do you think
 

1343
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:37,080
microprocessor engineer do you think
like a artist a philosopher do you think

1344
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:37,090
like a artist a philosopher do you think
 

1345
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,330
like a artist a philosopher do you think
in software and hardware I mean is it

1346
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:39,340
in software and hardware I mean is it
 

1347
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:43,080
in software and hardware I mean is it
art I see science yeah I'd say I think

1348
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:43,090
art I see science yeah I'd say I think
 

1349
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:44,519
art I see science yeah I'd say I think
designing a goods instruction set as an

1350
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:44,529
designing a goods instruction set as an
 

1351
00:28:44,529 --> 00:28:49,820
designing a goods instruction set as an
art and I think you're trying to balance

1352
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:49,830
art and I think you're trying to balance
 

1353
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:52,919
art and I think you're trying to balance
the the simplicity and speed of

1354
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:52,929
the the simplicity and speed of
 

1355
00:28:52,929 --> 00:28:56,399
the the simplicity and speed of
execution with how well easy it will be

1356
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:56,409
execution with how well easy it will be
 

1357
00:28:56,409 --> 00:28:58,740
execution with how well easy it will be
for compilers to use it alright you're

1358
00:28:58,740 --> 00:28:58,750
for compilers to use it alright you're
 

1359
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:00,980
for compilers to use it alright you're
trying to create an instruction set that

1360
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:00,990
trying to create an instruction set that
 

1361
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:03,149
trying to create an instruction set that
everything in there can be used by

1362
00:29:03,149 --> 00:29:03,159
everything in there can be used by
 

1363
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:06,090
everything in there can be used by
compilers there's not things that are

1364
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:06,100
compilers there's not things that are
 

1365
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,139
compilers there's not things that are
missing

1366
00:29:07,139 --> 00:29:07,149
missing
 

1367
00:29:07,149 --> 00:29:08,609
missing
that'll make it difficult for the

1368
00:29:08,609 --> 00:29:08,619
that'll make it difficult for the
 

1369
00:29:08,619 --> 00:29:11,909
that'll make it difficult for the
program to run they run efficiently but

1370
00:29:11,909 --> 00:29:11,919
program to run they run efficiently but
 

1371
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:13,590
program to run they run efficiently but
you want it to be easy to build as well

1372
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:13,600
you want it to be easy to build as well
 

1373
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,509
you want it to be easy to build as well
so it's that kind of so you're thinking

1374
00:29:15,509 --> 00:29:15,519
so it's that kind of so you're thinking
 

1375
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:16,590
so it's that kind of so you're thinking
I'd say you're thinking hard we're

1376
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:16,600
I'd say you're thinking hard we're
 

1377
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,299
I'd say you're thinking hard we're
trying to find a hardware software

1378
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:18,309
trying to find a hardware software
 

1379
00:29:18,309 --> 00:29:21,149
trying to find a hardware software
compromise that'll work well and and

1380
00:29:21,149 --> 00:29:21,159
compromise that'll work well and and
 

1381
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:24,090
compromise that'll work well and and
it's you know it's you know it's a

1382
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:24,100
it's you know it's you know it's a
 

1383
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,549
it's you know it's you know it's a
matter of taste right it's it's kind of

1384
00:29:26,549 --> 00:29:26,559
matter of taste right it's it's kind of
 

1385
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:29,519
matter of taste right it's it's kind of
fun to build instruction sets it's not

1386
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:29,529
fun to build instruction sets it's not
 

1387
00:29:29,529 --> 00:29:31,109
fun to build instruction sets it's not
that hard to build an instruction set

1388
00:29:31,109 --> 00:29:31,119
that hard to build an instruction set
 

1389
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:33,960
that hard to build an instruction set
but to build one that catches on and

1390
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:33,970
but to build one that catches on and
 

1391
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:36,810
but to build one that catches on and
people use you know you have to be you

1392
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:36,820
people use you know you have to be you
 

1393
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:38,700
people use you know you have to be you
know fortunate to be the right place at

1394
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:38,710
know fortunate to be the right place at
 

1395
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,710
know fortunate to be the right place at
the right time or have a design that

1396
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:40,720
the right time or have a design that
 

1397
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,049
the right time or have a design that
people really like are using metrics

1398
00:29:43,049 --> 00:29:43,059
people really like are using metrics
 

1399
00:29:43,059 --> 00:29:46,799
people really like are using metrics
says is it quantifiable because you kind

1400
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:46,809
says is it quantifiable because you kind
 

1401
00:29:46,809 --> 00:29:48,389
says is it quantifiable because you kind
of have to anticipate the kind of

1402
00:29:48,389 --> 00:29:48,399
of have to anticipate the kind of
 

1403
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:49,889
of have to anticipate the kind of
programs that people will write yet

1404
00:29:49,889 --> 00:29:49,899
programs that people will write yet
 

1405
00:29:49,899 --> 00:29:52,499
programs that people will write yet
ahead of time so is that can you use

1406
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:52,509
ahead of time so is that can you use
 

1407
00:29:52,509 --> 00:29:54,840
ahead of time so is that can you use
numbers can use metrics can you quantify

1408
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:54,850
numbers can use metrics can you quantify
 

1409
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:57,359
numbers can use metrics can you quantify
something ahead of time or is this again

1410
00:29:57,359 --> 00:29:57,369
something ahead of time or is this again
 

1411
00:29:57,369 --> 00:29:58,919
something ahead of time or is this again
that's the art part where you're kind of

1412
00:29:58,919 --> 00:29:58,929
that's the art part where you're kind of
 

1413
00:29:58,929 --> 00:30:01,919
that's the art part where you're kind of
knows it's a a big a big change kind of

1414
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:01,929
knows it's a a big a big change kind of
 

1415
00:30:01,929 --> 00:30:04,710
knows it's a a big a big change kind of
what happened I think from Hennessey's

1416
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:04,720
what happened I think from Hennessey's
 

1417
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,289
what happened I think from Hennessey's
and my perspective in the 1980s what

1418
00:30:07,289 --> 00:30:07,299
and my perspective in the 1980s what
 

1419
00:30:07,299 --> 00:30:11,180
and my perspective in the 1980s what
happened was going from kind of really

1420
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:11,190
happened was going from kind of really
 

1421
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:15,109
happened was going from kind of really
you know taste and hunches to

1422
00:30:15,109 --> 00:30:15,119
you know taste and hunches to
 

1423
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:18,840
you know taste and hunches to
quantifiable in in fact he and I wrote a

1424
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:18,850
quantifiable in in fact he and I wrote a
 

1425
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:21,149
quantifiable in in fact he and I wrote a
textbook at the end of the 1980s called

1426
00:30:21,149 --> 00:30:21,159
textbook at the end of the 1980s called
 

1427
00:30:21,159 --> 00:30:22,769
textbook at the end of the 1980s called
computer architecture a quantitative

1428
00:30:22,769 --> 00:30:22,779
computer architecture a quantitative
 

1429
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:25,830
computer architecture a quantitative
approach I heard of that and and it's

1430
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:25,840
approach I heard of that and and it's
 

1431
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,799
approach I heard of that and and it's
it's the thing it it had a pretty big

1432
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:28,809
it's the thing it it had a pretty big
 

1433
00:30:28,809 --> 00:30:30,599
it's the thing it it had a pretty big
big impact in the field because we went

1434
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:30,609
big impact in the field because we went
 

1435
00:30:30,609 --> 00:30:34,049
big impact in the field because we went
from textbooks that kind of listed so

1436
00:30:34,049 --> 00:30:34,059
from textbooks that kind of listed so
 

1437
00:30:34,059 --> 00:30:35,820
from textbooks that kind of listed so
here's what this computer does and

1438
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:35,830
here's what this computer does and
 

1439
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:37,259
here's what this computer does and
here's the pros and cons and here's what

1440
00:30:37,259 --> 00:30:37,269
here's the pros and cons and here's what
 

1441
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:38,700
here's the pros and cons and here's what
this computer doesn't pros and cons to

1442
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:38,710
this computer doesn't pros and cons to
 

1443
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:40,590
this computer doesn't pros and cons to
something where there were formulas

1444
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:40,600
something where there were formulas
 

1445
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,970
something where there were formulas
in equations where you could measure

1446
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:41,980
in equations where you could measure
 

1447
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,980
in equations where you could measure
things so specifically for instruction

1448
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:43,990
things so specifically for instruction
 

1449
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:49,409
things so specifically for instruction
sets what we do in some other fields do

1450
00:30:49,409 --> 00:30:49,419
sets what we do in some other fields do
 

1451
00:30:49,419 --> 00:30:52,049
sets what we do in some other fields do
is we agree upon a set of programs which

1452
00:30:52,049 --> 00:30:52,059
is we agree upon a set of programs which
 

1453
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:55,499
is we agree upon a set of programs which
we call benchmarks and a suite of

1454
00:30:55,499 --> 00:30:55,509
we call benchmarks and a suite of
 

1455
00:30:55,509 --> 00:30:57,919
we call benchmarks and a suite of
programs and then you develop both the

1456
00:30:57,919 --> 00:30:57,929
programs and then you develop both the
 

1457
00:30:57,929 --> 00:31:00,870
programs and then you develop both the
hardware and the compiler and you get

1458
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:00,880
hardware and the compiler and you get
 

1459
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:05,490
hardware and the compiler and you get
numbers on how well your your computer

1460
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:05,500
numbers on how well your your computer
 

1461
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:08,190
numbers on how well your your computer
does given its instruction set and how

1462
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:08,200
does given its instruction set and how
 

1463
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,570
does given its instruction set and how
well you implemented it in your

1464
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:09,580
well you implemented it in your
 

1465
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:11,100
well you implemented it in your
microprocessor and how good your

1466
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:11,110
microprocessor and how good your
 

1467
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:13,470
microprocessor and how good your
compilers are and in computer

1468
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:13,480
compilers are and in computer
 

1469
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,320
compilers are and in computer
architecture we you know using

1470
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:15,330
architecture we you know using
 

1471
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:17,460
architecture we you know using
professors terms we grade on a curve

1472
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:17,470
professors terms we grade on a curve
 

1473
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:19,049
professors terms we grade on a curve
rather than greater than absolute scale

1474
00:31:19,049 --> 00:31:19,059
rather than greater than absolute scale
 

1475
00:31:19,059 --> 00:31:21,600
rather than greater than absolute scale
so when you say you know this these

1476
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:21,610
so when you say you know this these
 

1477
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:23,220
so when you say you know this these
programs run this fast well that's kind

1478
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:23,230
programs run this fast well that's kind
 

1479
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:24,779
programs run this fast well that's kind
of interesting but how do you know it's

1480
00:31:24,779 --> 00:31:24,789
of interesting but how do you know it's
 

1481
00:31:24,789 --> 00:31:26,600
of interesting but how do you know it's
better while you compare it to other

1482
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:26,610
better while you compare it to other
 

1483
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:29,549
better while you compare it to other
computers at the same time so the best

1484
00:31:29,549 --> 00:31:29,559
computers at the same time so the best
 

1485
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:32,490
computers at the same time so the best
way we know how to make turned it into a

1486
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:32,500
way we know how to make turned it into a
 

1487
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:35,340
way we know how to make turned it into a
kind of more science and experimental

1488
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:35,350
kind of more science and experimental
 

1489
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:38,100
kind of more science and experimental
and quantitative is to compare yourself

1490
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:38,110
and quantitative is to compare yourself
 

1491
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:39,899
and quantitative is to compare yourself
to other computers or the same era that

1492
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:39,909
to other computers or the same era that
 

1493
00:31:39,909 --> 00:31:41,369
to other computers or the same era that
have the same access the same kind of

1494
00:31:41,369 --> 00:31:41,379
have the same access the same kind of
 

1495
00:31:41,379 --> 00:31:44,249
have the same access the same kind of
technology on commonly agreed benchmark

1496
00:31:44,249 --> 00:31:44,259
technology on commonly agreed benchmark
 

1497
00:31:44,259 --> 00:31:47,610
technology on commonly agreed benchmark
programs so maybe two toss-up two

1498
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:47,620
programs so maybe two toss-up two
 

1499
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:49,560
programs so maybe two toss-up two
possible directions we can go one is

1500
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:49,570
possible directions we can go one is
 

1501
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:51,509
possible directions we can go one is
what are the different trade-offs in

1502
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:51,519
what are the different trade-offs in
 

1503
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:54,659
what are the different trade-offs in
designing architectures Ubben are you

1504
00:31:54,659 --> 00:31:54,669
designing architectures Ubben are you
 

1505
00:31:54,669 --> 00:31:56,430
designing architectures Ubben are you
talking about Siskin risk but maybe a

1506
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:56,440
talking about Siskin risk but maybe a
 

1507
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:59,399
talking about Siskin risk but maybe a
little bit more detail in terms of

1508
00:31:59,399 --> 00:31:59,409
little bit more detail in terms of
 

1509
00:31:59,409 --> 00:32:01,230
little bit more detail in terms of
specific features that you were thinking

1510
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:01,240
specific features that you were thinking
 

1511
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:04,259
specific features that you were thinking
about and the other side is what are the

1512
00:32:04,259 --> 00:32:04,269
about and the other side is what are the
 

1513
00:32:04,269 --> 00:32:06,419
about and the other side is what are the
metrics that you're thinking about when

1514
00:32:06,419 --> 00:32:06,429
metrics that you're thinking about when
 

1515
00:32:06,429 --> 00:32:08,519
metrics that you're thinking about when
looking at these trade-offs yeah well

1516
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:08,529
looking at these trade-offs yeah well
 

1517
00:32:08,529 --> 00:32:12,090
looking at these trade-offs yeah well
let's talk about the metrics so during

1518
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:12,100
let's talk about the metrics so during
 

1519
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,860
let's talk about the metrics so during
these debates we actually had kind of a

1520
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:13,870
these debates we actually had kind of a
 

1521
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:16,259
these debates we actually had kind of a
hard time explaining convincing people

1522
00:32:16,259 --> 00:32:16,269
hard time explaining convincing people
 

1523
00:32:16,269 --> 00:32:18,180
hard time explaining convincing people
the ideas and partly we didn't have a

1524
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:18,190
the ideas and partly we didn't have a
 

1525
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:21,419
the ideas and partly we didn't have a
formula to explain it and a few years

1526
00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:21,429
formula to explain it and a few years
 

1527
00:32:21,429 --> 00:32:23,999
formula to explain it and a few years
into it we hit upon the formula that

1528
00:32:23,999 --> 00:32:24,009
into it we hit upon the formula that
 

1529
00:32:24,009 --> 00:32:27,240
into it we hit upon the formula that
helped explain what was going on and I

1530
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:27,250
helped explain what was going on and I
 

1531
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:29,310
helped explain what was going on and I
think if we can do this see how it works

1532
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:29,320
think if we can do this see how it works
 

1533
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:33,180
think if we can do this see how it works
orally just is this so the yes if I can

1534
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:33,190
orally just is this so the yes if I can
 

1535
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:36,570
orally just is this so the yes if I can
do a formula or Li L C so the so

1536
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:36,580
do a formula or Li L C so the so
 

1537
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,970
do a formula or Li L C so the so
fundamentally the way you measure

1538
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:38,980
fundamentally the way you measure
 

1539
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,799
fundamentally the way you measure
performance is how long does it take a

1540
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:40,809
performance is how long does it take a
 

1541
00:32:40,809 --> 00:32:44,340
performance is how long does it take a
program to run a program if you have ten

1542
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:44,350
program to run a program if you have ten
 

1543
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:46,680
program to run a program if you have ten
programs and typically these benchmarks

1544
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:46,690
programs and typically these benchmarks
 

1545
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:47,970
programs and typically these benchmarks
were sweet because you'd want to have

1546
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:47,980
were sweet because you'd want to have
 

1547
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,710
were sweet because you'd want to have
ten programs so they could represents

1548
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:49,720
ten programs so they could represents
 

1549
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,570
ten programs so they could represents
lots of different applications so for

1550
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:51,580
lots of different applications so for
 

1551
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:53,490
lots of different applications so for
these ten programs how long they take to

1552
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:53,500
these ten programs how long they take to
 

1553
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,109
these ten programs how long they take to
run

1554
00:32:54,109 --> 00:32:54,119
run
 

1555
00:32:54,119 --> 00:32:56,089
run
now when you're trying to explain why it

1556
00:32:56,089 --> 00:32:56,099
now when you're trying to explain why it
 

1557
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:58,759
now when you're trying to explain why it
took so long you could factor how long

1558
00:32:58,759 --> 00:32:58,769
took so long you could factor how long
 

1559
00:32:58,769 --> 00:33:00,529
took so long you could factor how long
it takes a program to run into three

1560
00:33:00,529 --> 00:33:00,539
it takes a program to run into three
 

1561
00:33:00,539 --> 00:33:05,329
it takes a program to run into three
factors one of the first one is how many

1562
00:33:05,329 --> 00:33:05,339
factors one of the first one is how many
 

1563
00:33:05,339 --> 00:33:07,339
factors one of the first one is how many
instructions did it take to execute so

1564
00:33:07,339 --> 00:33:07,349
instructions did it take to execute so
 

1565
00:33:07,349 --> 00:33:09,169
instructions did it take to execute so
that's the that's the what we've been

1566
00:33:09,169 --> 00:33:09,179
that's the that's the what we've been
 

1567
00:33:09,179 --> 00:33:10,519
that's the that's the what we've been
talking about you know the instructions

1568
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:10,529
talking about you know the instructions
 

1569
00:33:10,529 --> 00:33:11,089
talking about you know the instructions
of Academy

1570
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:11,099
of Academy
 

1571
00:33:11,099 --> 00:33:14,269
of Academy
how many did it take all right the next

1572
00:33:14,269 --> 00:33:14,279
how many did it take all right the next
 

1573
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:16,579
how many did it take all right the next
question is how long did each

1574
00:33:16,579 --> 00:33:16,589
question is how long did each
 

1575
00:33:16,589 --> 00:33:18,949
question is how long did each
instruction take to run on average so

1576
00:33:18,949 --> 00:33:18,959
instruction take to run on average so
 

1577
00:33:18,959 --> 00:33:21,139
instruction take to run on average so
you multiply the number instructions

1578
00:33:21,139 --> 00:33:21,149
you multiply the number instructions
 

1579
00:33:21,149 --> 00:33:23,719
you multiply the number instructions
times how long it took to run and that

1580
00:33:23,719 --> 00:33:23,729
times how long it took to run and that
 

1581
00:33:23,729 --> 00:33:25,759
times how long it took to run and that
gets you help okay so that's but now

1582
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:25,769
gets you help okay so that's but now
 

1583
00:33:25,769 --> 00:33:28,609
gets you help okay so that's but now
let's look at this metric of how long

1584
00:33:28,609 --> 00:33:28,619
let's look at this metric of how long
 

1585
00:33:28,619 --> 00:33:30,109
let's look at this metric of how long
did it take the instruction to run well

1586
00:33:30,109 --> 00:33:30,119
did it take the instruction to run well
 

1587
00:33:30,119 --> 00:33:32,569
did it take the instruction to run well
it turns out the way we could build

1588
00:33:32,569 --> 00:33:32,579
it turns out the way we could build
 

1589
00:33:32,579 --> 00:33:34,759
it turns out the way we could build
computers today is they all have a clock

1590
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:34,769
computers today is they all have a clock
 

1591
00:33:34,769 --> 00:33:36,979
computers today is they all have a clock
and you've seen this when you if you buy

1592
00:33:36,979 --> 00:33:36,989
and you've seen this when you if you buy
 

1593
00:33:36,989 --> 00:33:40,339
and you've seen this when you if you buy
a microprocessor it'll say 3.1 gigahertz

1594
00:33:40,339 --> 00:33:40,349
a microprocessor it'll say 3.1 gigahertz
 

1595
00:33:40,349 --> 00:33:43,249
a microprocessor it'll say 3.1 gigahertz
or 2.5 gigahertz and more gigahertz is

1596
00:33:43,249 --> 00:33:43,259
or 2.5 gigahertz and more gigahertz is
 

1597
00:33:43,259 --> 00:33:45,679
or 2.5 gigahertz and more gigahertz is
good well what that is is the speed of

1598
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:45,689
good well what that is is the speed of
 

1599
00:33:45,689 --> 00:33:49,519
good well what that is is the speed of
the clock so 2.5 gigahertz turns out to

1600
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:49,529
the clock so 2.5 gigahertz turns out to
 

1601
00:33:49,529 --> 00:33:52,219
the clock so 2.5 gigahertz turns out to
be 4 billions of instruction or 4

1602
00:33:52,219 --> 00:33:52,229
be 4 billions of instruction or 4
 

1603
00:33:52,229 --> 00:33:54,619
be 4 billions of instruction or 4
nanoseconds so that's the clock cycle

1604
00:33:54,619 --> 00:33:54,629
nanoseconds so that's the clock cycle
 

1605
00:33:54,629 --> 00:33:57,259
nanoseconds so that's the clock cycle
time but there's another factor which is

1606
00:33:57,259 --> 00:33:57,269
time but there's another factor which is
 

1607
00:33:57,269 --> 00:33:59,419
time but there's another factor which is
what's the average number of clock

1608
00:33:59,419 --> 00:33:59,429
what's the average number of clock
 

1609
00:33:59,429 --> 00:34:01,459
what's the average number of clock
cycles that takes per instructions so

1610
00:34:01,459 --> 00:34:01,469
cycles that takes per instructions so
 

1611
00:34:01,469 --> 00:34:03,679
cycles that takes per instructions so
it's number of instructions average

1612
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:03,689
it's number of instructions average
 

1613
00:34:03,689 --> 00:34:05,089
it's number of instructions average
number of clock cycles in the clock

1614
00:34:05,089 --> 00:34:05,099
number of clock cycles in the clock
 

1615
00:34:05,099 --> 00:34:05,869
number of clock cycles in the clock
cycle time

1616
00:34:05,869 --> 00:34:05,879
cycle time
 

1617
00:34:05,879 --> 00:34:08,659
cycle time
so in these risks ist's debates we would

1618
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:08,669
so in these risks ist's debates we would
 

1619
00:34:08,669 --> 00:34:11,450
so in these risks ist's debates we would
we they would concentrate on but wrist

1620
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:11,460
we they would concentrate on but wrist
 

1621
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,249
we they would concentrate on but wrist
makes needs to take more instructions

1622
00:34:13,249 --> 00:34:13,259
makes needs to take more instructions
 

1623
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:15,889
makes needs to take more instructions
and we'd argue what maybe the clock

1624
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:15,899
and we'd argue what maybe the clock
 

1625
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:17,989
and we'd argue what maybe the clock
cycle is faster but what the real big

1626
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:17,999
cycle is faster but what the real big
 

1627
00:34:17,999 --> 00:34:20,089
cycle is faster but what the real big
difference was was the number of clock

1628
00:34:20,089 --> 00:34:20,099
difference was was the number of clock
 

1629
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:22,039
difference was was the number of clock
cycles per instruction or instruction as

1630
00:34:22,039 --> 00:34:22,049
cycles per instruction or instruction as
 

1631
00:34:22,049 --> 00:34:24,200
cycles per instruction or instruction as
fascinating what about the mess up the

1632
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:24,210
fascinating what about the mess up the
 

1633
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:26,029
fascinating what about the mess up the
beautiful mess of parallelism in the

1634
00:34:26,029 --> 00:34:26,039
beautiful mess of parallelism in the
 

1635
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:28,159
beautiful mess of parallelism in the
whole picture parallelism which has to

1636
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:28,169
whole picture parallelism which has to
 

1637
00:34:28,169 --> 00:34:30,409
whole picture parallelism which has to
do was say how many instructions could

1638
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:30,419
do was say how many instructions could
 

1639
00:34:30,419 --> 00:34:31,960
do was say how many instructions could
execute in parallel and things like that

1640
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:31,970
execute in parallel and things like that
 

1641
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:34,430
execute in parallel and things like that
you could think of that as affecting the

1642
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:34,440
you could think of that as affecting the
 

1643
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,720
you could think of that as affecting the
clock cycles per instruction because

1644
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:35,730
clock cycles per instruction because
 

1645
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:37,129
clock cycles per instruction because
it's the average clock cycles per

1646
00:34:37,129 --> 00:34:37,139
it's the average clock cycles per
 

1647
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:38,809
it's the average clock cycles per
instruction so when you're running a

1648
00:34:38,809 --> 00:34:38,819
instruction so when you're running a
 

1649
00:34:38,819 --> 00:34:41,539
instruction so when you're running a
program if it took a hundred billion

1650
00:34:41,539 --> 00:34:41,549
program if it took a hundred billion
 

1651
00:34:41,549 --> 00:34:44,629
program if it took a hundred billion
instructions and on average it took two

1652
00:34:44,629 --> 00:34:44,639
instructions and on average it took two
 

1653
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,190
instructions and on average it took two
clock cycles per instruction and they

1654
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:46,200
clock cycles per instruction and they
 

1655
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,599
clock cycles per instruction and they
were four nanoseconds you could multiply

1656
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:47,609
were four nanoseconds you could multiply
 

1657
00:34:47,609 --> 00:34:49,339
were four nanoseconds you could multiply
that out and see how long it took to run

1658
00:34:49,339 --> 00:34:49,349
that out and see how long it took to run
 

1659
00:34:49,349 --> 00:34:51,499
that out and see how long it took to run
and there's all kinds of tricks to try

1660
00:34:51,499 --> 00:34:51,509
and there's all kinds of tricks to try
 

1661
00:34:51,509 --> 00:34:52,909
and there's all kinds of tricks to try
and reduce the number of clock cycles

1662
00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:52,919
and reduce the number of clock cycles
 

1663
00:34:52,919 --> 00:34:56,749
and reduce the number of clock cycles
per instruction but it turned out that

1664
00:34:56,749 --> 00:34:56,759
per instruction but it turned out that
 

1665
00:34:56,759 --> 00:34:58,759
per instruction but it turned out that
the way they would do these complex

1666
00:34:58,759 --> 00:34:58,769
the way they would do these complex
 

1667
00:34:58,769 --> 00:35:00,499
the way they would do these complex
instructions is they would actually

1668
00:35:00,499 --> 00:35:00,509
instructions is they would actually
 

1669
00:35:00,509 --> 00:35:02,120
instructions is they would actually
build what we would call an interpreter

1670
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:02,130
build what we would call an interpreter
 

1671
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:05,089
build what we would call an interpreter
in a simpler a very simple hardware

1672
00:35:05,089 --> 00:35:05,099
in a simpler a very simple hardware
 

1673
00:35:05,099 --> 00:35:07,450
in a simpler a very simple hardware
interpreter but it turned out that for

1674
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:07,460
interpreter but it turned out that for
 

1675
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:09,910
interpreter but it turned out that for
sis constructions if you had to use one

1676
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:09,920
sis constructions if you had to use one
 

1677
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,410
sis constructions if you had to use one
of those interpreters it would be like

1678
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:11,420
of those interpreters it would be like
 

1679
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:13,480
of those interpreters it would be like
10 clock cycles per instruction where

1680
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:13,490
10 clock cycles per instruction where
 

1681
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:16,270
10 clock cycles per instruction where
the risk instructions could be too so

1682
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:16,280
the risk instructions could be too so
 

1683
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,190
the risk instructions could be too so
there'd be this factor of five advantage

1684
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:18,200
there'd be this factor of five advantage
 

1685
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,530
there'd be this factor of five advantage
in clock cycles per instruction we have

1686
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:20,540
in clock cycles per instruction we have
 

1687
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:23,079
in clock cycles per instruction we have
to execute say 25 or 50 percent more

1688
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:23,089
to execute say 25 or 50 percent more
 

1689
00:35:23,089 --> 00:35:24,370
to execute say 25 or 50 percent more
instructions so that's where the wind

1690
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:24,380
instructions so that's where the wind
 

1691
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,780
instructions so that's where the wind
would come and then you could make an

1692
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:25,790
would come and then you could make an
 

1693
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,370
would come and then you could make an
argument whether the clock cycle times

1694
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:27,380
argument whether the clock cycle times
 

1695
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:29,740
argument whether the clock cycle times
are the same or not but pointing out

1696
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:29,750
are the same or not but pointing out
 

1697
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:32,470
are the same or not but pointing out
that we could divide the benchmark

1698
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:32,480
that we could divide the benchmark
 

1699
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,480
that we could divide the benchmark
results time per program into three

1700
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:34,490
results time per program into three
 

1701
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:36,460
results time per program into three
factors and the biggest difference

1702
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:36,470
factors and the biggest difference
 

1703
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:38,349
factors and the biggest difference
between risk consists was the clock

1704
00:35:38,349 --> 00:35:38,359
between risk consists was the clock
 

1705
00:35:38,359 --> 00:35:40,210
between risk consists was the clock
cycles per you execute a few more

1706
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:40,220
cycles per you execute a few more
 

1707
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,650
cycles per you execute a few more
instructions but the clock cycles per

1708
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:41,660
instructions but the clock cycles per
 

1709
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:43,900
instructions but the clock cycles per
instruction is much less and that was

1710
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:43,910
instruction is much less and that was
 

1711
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:46,329
instruction is much less and that was
what this debate once we made that

1712
00:35:46,329 --> 00:35:46,339
what this debate once we made that
 

1713
00:35:46,339 --> 00:35:49,660
what this debate once we made that
argument then people say okay I get it

1714
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:49,670
argument then people say okay I get it
 

1715
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:53,290
argument then people say okay I get it
and so we went from it was outrageously

1716
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:53,300
and so we went from it was outrageously
 

1717
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:56,349
and so we went from it was outrageously
controversial in you know 1982 that

1718
00:35:56,349 --> 00:35:56,359
controversial in you know 1982 that
 

1719
00:35:56,359 --> 00:35:59,380
controversial in you know 1982 that
maybe probably by 1984 so people said oh

1720
00:35:59,380 --> 00:35:59,390
maybe probably by 1984 so people said oh
 

1721
00:35:59,390 --> 00:35:59,890
maybe probably by 1984 so people said oh
yeah

1722
00:35:59,890 --> 00:35:59,900
yeah
 

1723
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,620
yeah
technically they've got a good argument

1724
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:01,630
technically they've got a good argument
 

1725
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:05,109
technically they've got a good argument
what are the instructions in the RISC

1726
00:36:05,109 --> 00:36:05,119
what are the instructions in the RISC
 

1727
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:07,890
what are the instructions in the RISC
instruction set just to get an intuition

1728
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:07,900
instruction set just to get an intuition
 

1729
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,540
instruction set just to get an intuition
okay

1730
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:09,550
okay
 

1731
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:13,270
okay
1995 I was asked scientific the future

1732
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:13,280
1995 I was asked scientific the future
 

1733
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,450
1995 I was asked scientific the future
of what microprocessor so I and that

1734
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:16,460
of what microprocessor so I and that
 

1735
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:18,310
of what microprocessor so I and that
well as I'd seen these predictions and

1736
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:18,320
well as I'd seen these predictions and
 

1737
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,230
well as I'd seen these predictions and
usually people predict something

1738
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:20,240
usually people predict something
 

1739
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,750
usually people predict something
outrageous just to be entertaining right

1740
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:22,760
outrageous just to be entertaining right
 

1741
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,780
outrageous just to be entertaining right
and so my prediction for 2020 was you

1742
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:25,790
and so my prediction for 2020 was you
 

1743
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:27,099
and so my prediction for 2020 was you
know things are gonna be pretty much

1744
00:36:27,099 --> 00:36:27,109
know things are gonna be pretty much
 

1745
00:36:27,109 --> 00:36:29,410
know things are gonna be pretty much
they're gonna look very familiar to what

1746
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:29,420
they're gonna look very familiar to what
 

1747
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,570
they're gonna look very familiar to what
they are and they are in if you were to

1748
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:31,580
they are and they are in if you were to
 

1749
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:33,609
they are and they are in if you were to
read the article you know the things I

1750
00:36:33,609 --> 00:36:33,619
read the article you know the things I
 

1751
00:36:33,619 --> 00:36:34,900
read the article you know the things I
said are pretty much true the

1752
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:34,910
said are pretty much true the
 

1753
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:36,820
said are pretty much true the
instructions that have been around

1754
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:36,830
instructions that have been around
 

1755
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:38,589
instructions that have been around
forever are kind of the same and that's

1756
00:36:38,589 --> 00:36:38,599
forever are kind of the same and that's
 

1757
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:40,540
forever are kind of the same and that's
the outrageous prediction actually yeah

1758
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:40,550
the outrageous prediction actually yeah
 

1759
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:42,310
the outrageous prediction actually yeah
given how fast computers and well you

1760
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:42,320
given how fast computers and well you
 

1761
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,170
given how fast computers and well you
know Moore's law was gonna go on we

1762
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:44,180
know Moore's law was gonna go on we
 

1763
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:46,870
know Moore's law was gonna go on we
thought for 25 more years you know who

1764
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:46,880
thought for 25 more years you know who
 

1765
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,300
thought for 25 more years you know who
knows but kind of the surprising thing

1766
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:49,310
knows but kind of the surprising thing
 

1767
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:51,670
knows but kind of the surprising thing
in fact you know Hennessy and I you know

1768
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:51,680
in fact you know Hennessy and I you know
 

1769
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:55,329
in fact you know Hennessy and I you know
won the the ACM a.m. Turing award for

1770
00:36:55,329 --> 00:36:55,339
won the the ACM a.m. Turing award for
 

1771
00:36:55,339 --> 00:36:57,190
won the the ACM a.m. Turing award for
both the RISC instruction set

1772
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:57,200
both the RISC instruction set
 

1773
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,750
both the RISC instruction set
contributions and for that textbook I

1774
00:36:58,750 --> 00:36:58,760
contributions and for that textbook I
 

1775
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,970
contributions and for that textbook I
mentioned but you know we are surprised

1776
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:00,980
mentioned but you know we are surprised
 

1777
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:06,280
mentioned but you know we are surprised
that here we are 35 40 years later after

1778
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:06,290
that here we are 35 40 years later after
 

1779
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:09,849
that here we are 35 40 years later after
we did our work and the the conventional

1780
00:37:09,849 --> 00:37:09,859
we did our work and the the conventional
 

1781
00:37:09,859 --> 00:37:11,560
we did our work and the the conventional
wisdom of the best way to do instruction

1782
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:11,570
wisdom of the best way to do instruction
 

1783
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:13,660
wisdom of the best way to do instruction
sets is still those RISC instruction

1784
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:13,670
sets is still those RISC instruction
 

1785
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:16,180
sets is still those RISC instruction
sets that look very similar to what we

1786
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:16,190
sets that look very similar to what we
 

1787
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:17,980
sets that look very similar to what we
look like you know we did in the 1980s

1788
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:17,990
look like you know we did in the 1980s
 

1789
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:21,400
look like you know we did in the 1980s
so those surprisingly there hasn't

1790
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:21,410
so those surprisingly there hasn't
 

1791
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:24,190
so those surprisingly there hasn't
some radical new idea even though we

1792
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:24,200
some radical new idea even though we
 

1793
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,990
some radical new idea even though we
have you know a million times as many

1794
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:26,000
have you know a million times as many
 

1795
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,310
have you know a million times as many
transistors as we had back then but what

1796
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:30,320
transistors as we had back then but what
 

1797
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,110
transistors as we had back then but what
are the basic constructions and how did

1798
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:32,120
are the basic constructions and how did
 

1799
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,760
are the basic constructions and how did
they change over the years so we're

1800
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:33,770
they change over the years so we're
 

1801
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:35,410
they change over the years so we're
talking about addition subtract these

1802
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:35,420
talking about addition subtract these
 

1803
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:38,530
talking about addition subtract these
are the specific so the the to get so

1804
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:38,540
are the specific so the the to get so
 

1805
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:40,060
are the specific so the the to get so
the things that are in a calculator you

1806
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:40,070
the things that are in a calculator you
 

1807
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:42,760
the things that are in a calculator you
are in a computer so any of the buttons

1808
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:42,770
are in a computer so any of the buttons
 

1809
00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:44,230
are in a computer so any of the buttons
that are in the calculator in the crater

1810
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:44,240
that are in the calculator in the crater
 

1811
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,050
that are in the calculator in the crater
so the little button so if there's a

1812
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:47,060
so the little button so if there's a
 

1813
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:48,790
so the little button so if there's a
memory function key and like I said

1814
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:48,800
memory function key and like I said
 

1815
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,500
memory function key and like I said
those are turns into putting something

1816
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:50,510
those are turns into putting something
 

1817
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:51,850
those are turns into putting something
in memories called a store bring

1818
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:51,860
in memories called a store bring
 

1819
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:53,440
in memories called a store bring
something back Scott load just as a

1820
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:53,450
something back Scott load just as a
 

1821
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:55,900
something back Scott load just as a
quick tangent when you say memory what

1822
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:55,910
quick tangent when you say memory what
 

1823
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:58,750
quick tangent when you say memory what
does memory mean well I told you there

1824
00:37:58,750 --> 00:37:58,760
does memory mean well I told you there
 

1825
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,820
does memory mean well I told you there
were five pieces of a computer and if

1826
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:00,830
were five pieces of a computer and if
 

1827
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:02,620
were five pieces of a computer and if
you remember in a calculator there's a

1828
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:02,630
you remember in a calculator there's a
 

1829
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:04,360
you remember in a calculator there's a
memory key so you you want to have

1830
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:04,370
memory key so you you want to have
 

1831
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:05,800
memory key so you you want to have
intermediate calculation and bring it

1832
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:05,810
intermediate calculation and bring it
 

1833
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:06,310
intermediate calculation and bring it
back later

1834
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:06,320
back later
 

1835
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,950
back later
so you'd hit the memory plus key M plus

1836
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:08,960
so you'd hit the memory plus key M plus
 

1837
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,780
so you'd hit the memory plus key M plus
maybe and it would put that into memory

1838
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:10,790
maybe and it would put that into memory
 

1839
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:13,090
maybe and it would put that into memory
and then you'd hit an REM like return

1840
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:13,100
and then you'd hit an REM like return
 

1841
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,590
and then you'd hit an REM like return
instruction and it bring it back in the

1842
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:14,600
instruction and it bring it back in the
 

1843
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,300
instruction and it bring it back in the
display so you don't have to type it you

1844
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:16,310
display so you don't have to type it you
 

1845
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:17,230
display so you don't have to type it you
don't have to write it down bring it

1846
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:17,240
don't have to write it down bring it
 

1847
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,360
don't have to write it down bring it
back again so that's exactly what memory

1848
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:19,370
back again so that's exactly what memory
 

1849
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:21,880
back again so that's exactly what memory
is if you can put things into it as

1850
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:21,890
is if you can put things into it as
 

1851
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:23,440
is if you can put things into it as
temporary storage and bring it back when

1852
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:23,450
temporary storage and bring it back when
 

1853
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:25,210
temporary storage and bring it back when
you need it later

1854
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:25,220
you need it later
 

1855
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:27,130
you need it later
so that's memory and loads and stores

1856
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:27,140
so that's memory and loads and stores
 

1857
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:28,990
so that's memory and loads and stores
but the big thing the difference between

1858
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:29,000
but the big thing the difference between
 

1859
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,770
but the big thing the difference between
a computer and a calculator is that the

1860
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:32,780
a computer and a calculator is that the
 

1861
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:35,230
a computer and a calculator is that the
computer can make decisions and in

1862
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:35,240
computer can make decisions and in
 

1863
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,660
computer can make decisions and in
amazingly the decisions are as simple is

1864
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:37,670
amazingly the decisions are as simple is
 

1865
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:40,900
amazingly the decisions are as simple is
is this value less than zero or is this

1866
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:40,910
is this value less than zero or is this
 

1867
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:43,390
is this value less than zero or is this
value bigger than that value so there's

1868
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:43,400
value bigger than that value so there's
 

1869
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,910
value bigger than that value so there's
and those instructions which are called

1870
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:45,920
and those instructions which are called
 

1871
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,890
and those instructions which are called
conditional branch instructions is what

1872
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:47,900
conditional branch instructions is what
 

1873
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:50,650
conditional branch instructions is what
give computers all its power if you were

1874
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:50,660
give computers all its power if you were
 

1875
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:52,510
give computers all its power if you were
in the early days of computing before

1876
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:52,520
in the early days of computing before
 

1877
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,100
in the early days of computing before
the what's called the general-purpose

1878
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:54,110
the what's called the general-purpose
 

1879
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:56,800
the what's called the general-purpose
microprocessor people would write these

1880
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:56,810
microprocessor people would write these
 

1881
00:38:56,810 --> 00:39:00,430
microprocessor people would write these
instructions kind of in hardware and but

1882
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:00,440
instructions kind of in hardware and but
 

1883
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,140
instructions kind of in hardware and but
it couldn't make decisions it would just

1884
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:02,150
it couldn't make decisions it would just
 

1885
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:04,120
it couldn't make decisions it would just
it would do the same thing over and over

1886
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:04,130
it would do the same thing over and over
 

1887
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:07,300
it would do the same thing over and over
again with the power of having branch

1888
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:07,310
again with the power of having branch
 

1889
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:09,100
again with the power of having branch
instructions that can look at things and

1890
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:09,110
instructions that can look at things and
 

1891
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:11,110
instructions that can look at things and
make decisions automatically and it can

1892
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:11,120
make decisions automatically and it can
 

1893
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,700
make decisions automatically and it can
make these decisions you know billions

1894
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:12,710
make these decisions you know billions
 

1895
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:15,280
make these decisions you know billions
of times per second and amazingly enough

1896
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:15,290
of times per second and amazingly enough
 

1897
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:17,350
of times per second and amazingly enough
we can get you know thanks to advances

1898
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:17,360
we can get you know thanks to advances
 

1899
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,300
we can get you know thanks to advances
machine learning we can we can create

1900
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:19,310
machine learning we can we can create
 

1901
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:21,550
machine learning we can we can create
programs that can do something smarter

1902
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:21,560
programs that can do something smarter
 

1903
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,350
programs that can do something smarter
than human beings can do but if you go

1904
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:23,360
than human beings can do but if you go
 

1905
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,200
than human beings can do but if you go
down that very basic level it's the

1906
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:25,210
down that very basic level it's the
 

1907
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:27,220
down that very basic level it's the
instructions are the keys on the

1908
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:27,230
instructions are the keys on the
 

1909
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:29,380
instructions are the keys on the
calculator plus the ability to make

00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:29,390
calculator plus the ability to make
 

1911
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:31,330
calculator plus the ability to make
decisions of these conditional branch

1912
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:31,340
decisions of these conditional branch
 

1913
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:33,100
decisions of these conditional branch
instructions you know and all decisions

1914
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:33,110
instructions you know and all decisions
 

1915
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:35,380

fundamental can be reduced down to these

1916
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:35,390
fundamental can be reduced down to these
 

1917
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:38,790
fundamental can be reduced down to these
- assumptions yeah so in in fact and so

1918
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:38,800
- assumptions yeah so in in fact and so
 

1919
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,710

you know going way back in the sack back

1920
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:41,720
you know going way back in the sack back
 

1921
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,720
you know going way back in the sack back
to you know we did for risk projects at

1922
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:43,730
to you know we did for risk projects at
 

1923
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:46,000
to you know we did for risk projects at
Berkeley in the 1980s they did a couple

1924
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:46,010
Berkeley in the 1980s they did a couple
 

1925
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:50,740
Berkeley in the 1980s they did a couple
at Stanford in the 1980s in 2010 we

1926
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:50,750
at Stanford in the 1980s in 2010 we
 

1927
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:52,930
at Stanford in the 1980s in 2010 we
decided we wanted to do a new

1928
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:52,940
decided we wanted to do a new
 

1929
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:54,460
decided we wanted to do a new
instruction set learning from the

1930
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:54,470
instruction set learning from the
 

1931
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:56,530
instruction set learning from the
mistakes of those RISC architectures of

1932
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:56,540
mistakes of those RISC architectures of
 

1933
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:59,380
mistakes of those RISC architectures of
1980s and that was done here at Berkeley

1934
00:39:59,380 --> 00:39:59,390
1980s and that was done here at Berkeley
 

1935
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:02,890
1980s and that was done here at Berkeley
almost exactly 10 years ago in the the

1936
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:02,900
almost exactly 10 years ago in the the
 

1937
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,780
almost exactly 10 years ago in the the
people who did it I participated but

1938
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:04,790
people who did it I participated but
 

1939
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:06,970
people who did it I participated but
other Christos Sanne [\h__\h] and others

1940
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:06,980
other Christos Sanne [\h__\h] and others
 

1941
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:07,840
other Christos Sanne [\h__\h] and others
drove it

1942
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:07,850
drove it
 

1943
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:10,180
drove it
they called it risk 5 to honor those

1944
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:10,190
they called it risk 5 to honor those
 

1945
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:14,110
they called it risk 5 to honor those
risk the four risk projects of 1980s so

1946
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:14,120
risk the four risk projects of 1980s so
 

1947
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,840
risk the four risk projects of 1980s so
what is risk 5 involved so leaders 5 is

1948
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:16,850
what is risk 5 involved so leaders 5 is
 

1949
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:19,390
what is risk 5 involved so leaders 5 is
another instruction set of vocabulary

1950
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:19,400
another instruction set of vocabulary
 

1951
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,880
another instruction set of vocabulary
it's learned from the mistakes of the

1952
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:21,890
it's learned from the mistakes of the
 

1953
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:24,070
it's learned from the mistakes of the
past but it still has if you look at the

1954
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:24,080
past but it still has if you look at the
 

1955
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,900
past but it still has if you look at the
there's a core set of instructions it's

1956
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:25,910
there's a core set of instructions it's
 

1957
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:27,760
there's a core set of instructions it's
very similar to the simplest

1958
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:27,770
very similar to the simplest
 

1959
00:40:27,770 --> 00:40:30,460
very similar to the simplest
architectures from the 1980s and the big

1960
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:30,470
architectures from the 1980s and the big
 

1961
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:33,520
architectures from the 1980s and the big
difference about risk 5 is it's open so

1962
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:33,530
difference about risk 5 is it's open so
 

1963
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:35,880
difference about risk 5 is it's open so
I talked early about proprietary versus

1964
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:35,890
I talked early about proprietary versus
 

1965
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:40,930
I talked early about proprietary versus
open and kind of sauce software so this

1966
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:40,940
open and kind of sauce software so this
 

1967
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,730
open and kind of sauce software so this
is an instruction set so it's a

1968
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:42,740
is an instruction set so it's a
 

1969
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,620
is an instruction set so it's a
vocabulary it's not it's not hardware

1970
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:44,630
vocabulary it's not it's not hardware
 

1971
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:47,410
vocabulary it's not it's not hardware
but by having an open instruction set we

1972
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:47,420
but by having an open instruction set we
 

1973
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:49,750
but by having an open instruction set we
can have open source implementations

1974
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:49,760
can have open source implementations
 

1975
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,240
can have open source implementations
open source processors that people can

1976
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:52,250
open source processors that people can
 

1977
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:56,590
open source processors that people can
use where do you see that going says

1978
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:56,600
use where do you see that going says
 

1979
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,000
use where do you see that going says
it's the really exciting possibilities

1980
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:58,010
it's the really exciting possibilities
 

1981
00:40:58,010 --> 00:40:59,710
it's the really exciting possibilities
but she's just like in the Scientific

1982
00:40:59,710 --> 00:40:59,720
but she's just like in the Scientific
 

1983
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:02,320
but she's just like in the Scientific
American if you were to predict 10 20 30

1984
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:02,330
American if you were to predict 10 20 30
 

1985
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:05,350
American if you were to predict 10 20 30
years from now that kind of ability to

1986
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:05,360
years from now that kind of ability to
 

1987
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:08,560
years from now that kind of ability to
utilize open source instruction set

1988
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:08,570
utilize open source instruction set
 

1989
00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:11,950
utilize open source instruction set
architectures like risk 5 what kind of

1990
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:11,960
architectures like risk 5 what kind of
 

1991
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:14,050
architectures like risk 5 what kind of
possibilities might that unlock yeah and

1992
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:14,060
possibilities might that unlock yeah and
 

1993
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:16,840
possibilities might that unlock yeah and
so just to make it clear because this is

1994
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:16,850
so just to make it clear because this is
 

1995
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:20,410
so just to make it clear because this is
confusing the specification of risk 5 is

1996
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:20,420
confusing the specification of risk 5 is
 

1997
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:22,060
confusing the specification of risk 5 is
something that's like in a text book

1998
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:22,070
something that's like in a text book
 

1999
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:24,640
something that's like in a text book
there's books about it so that's what

2000
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:24,650
there's books about it so that's what
 

2001
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:26,790
there's books about it so that's what
that's kind of defining an interface

2002
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:26,800
that's kind of defining an interface
 

2003
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,680
that's kind of defining an interface
there's also the way you build hardware

2004
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:29,690
there's also the way you build hardware
 

2005
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:32,080
there's also the way you build hardware
is you write it in languages they're

2006
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:32,090
is you write it in languages they're
 

2007
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:34,510
is you write it in languages they're
kind of like sea but they're specialized

2008
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:34,520
kind of like sea but they're specialized
 

2009
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,780
kind of like sea but they're specialized
for hardware that gets translated into

2010
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:36,790
for hardware that gets translated into
 

2011
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:40,660
for hardware that gets translated into
hardware and so these implementations of

2012
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:40,670
hardware and so these implementations of
 

2013
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:43,240
hardware and so these implementations of
this specification are what are the open

2014
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:43,250
this specification are what are the open
 

2015
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:45,070
this specification are what are the open
source so they're written in something

2016
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:45,080
source so they're written in something
 

2017
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,830
source so they're written in something
that's called Verilog or VHDL but it's

2018
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:47,840
that's called Verilog or VHDL but it's
 

2019
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,210
that's called Verilog or VHDL but it's
put up on the web

2020
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:49,220
put up on the web
 

2021
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:52,720
put up on the web
like that you can see the C++ code for

2022
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:52,730
like that you can see the C++ code for
 

2023
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:56,050
like that you can see the C++ code for
Linux on the web so that's the open

2024
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:56,060
Linux on the web so that's the open
 

2025
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:59,200
Linux on the web so that's the open
instruction set enables open source

2026
00:41:59,200 --> 00:41:59,210
instruction set enables open source
 

2027
00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:00,970
instruction set enables open source
implementations at risk five so you can

2028
00:42:00,970 --> 00:42:00,980
implementations at risk five so you can
 

2029
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:02,740
implementations at risk five so you can
literally build a processor using this

2030
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:02,750
literally build a processor using this
 

2031
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:05,320
literally build a processor using this
instruction set people are and people

2032
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:05,330
instruction set people are and people
 

2033
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:07,030
instruction set people are and people
are so what happened to us that the

2034
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:07,040
are so what happened to us that the
 

2035
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,460
are so what happened to us that the
story was this was developed here for

2036
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:09,470
story was this was developed here for
 

2037
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:12,880
story was this was developed here for
our use to do our research and we made

2038
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:12,890
our use to do our research and we made
 

2039
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:14,589
our use to do our research and we made
it we licensed under the berkeley

2040
00:42:14,589 --> 00:42:14,599
it we licensed under the berkeley
 

2041
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:16,570
it we licensed under the berkeley
software distribution license like a lot

2042
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:16,580
software distribution license like a lot
 

2043
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:18,310
software distribution license like a lot
of things get licensed here so other

2044
00:42:18,310 --> 00:42:18,320
of things get licensed here so other
 

2045
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,780
of things get licensed here so other
academics use it they wouldn't be afraid

2046
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:19,790
academics use it they wouldn't be afraid
 

2047
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:24,130
academics use it they wouldn't be afraid
to use it and then about 2014 we started

2048
00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:24,140
to use it and then about 2014 we started
 

2049
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:26,620
to use it and then about 2014 we started
getting complaints that we were using it

2050
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:26,630
getting complaints that we were using it
 

2051
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:29,020
getting complaints that we were using it
in our research in our courses and we

2052
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:29,030
in our research in our courses and we
 

2053
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:30,730
in our research in our courses and we
got complaints from people in industries

2054
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:30,740
got complaints from people in industries
 

2055
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:33,040
got complaints from people in industries
why did you change your instruction set

2056
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:33,050
why did you change your instruction set
 

2057
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:36,640
why did you change your instruction set
between the fall and the spring semester

2058
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:36,650
between the fall and the spring semester
 

2059
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:38,290
between the fall and the spring semester
and well we get complaints of additional

2060
00:42:38,290 --> 00:42:38,300
and well we get complaints of additional
 

2061
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:40,930
and well we get complaints of additional
time why the hell do you care what we do

2062
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:40,940
time why the hell do you care what we do
 

2063
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:42,400
time why the hell do you care what we do
with our instruction set and then when

2064
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:42,410
with our instruction set and then when
 

2065
00:42:42,410 --> 00:42:44,320
with our instruction set and then when
we talked to him we found out there was

2066
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:44,330
we talked to him we found out there was
 

2067
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:46,300
we talked to him we found out there was
this thirst for this idea of an open

2068
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:46,310
this thirst for this idea of an open
 

2069
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:47,890
this thirst for this idea of an open
instruction set architecture and they

2070
00:42:47,890 --> 00:42:47,900
instruction set architecture and they
 

2071
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,900
instruction set architecture and they
had been looking for one they stumbled

2072
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:49,910
had been looking for one they stumbled
 

2073
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:52,839
had been looking for one they stumbled
upon ours at Berkeley thought it was boy

2074
00:42:52,839 --> 00:42:52,849
upon ours at Berkeley thought it was boy
 

2075
00:42:52,849 --> 00:42:54,820
upon ours at Berkeley thought it was boy
this looks great we should use this one

2076
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:54,830
this looks great we should use this one
 

2077
00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:57,970
this looks great we should use this one
and so once we realize there is this

2078
00:42:57,970 --> 00:42:57,980
and so once we realize there is this
 

2079
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:59,890
and so once we realize there is this
need for an open instruction set

2080
00:42:59,890 --> 00:42:59,900
need for an open instruction set
 

2081
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:01,570
need for an open instruction set
architecture we thought that's a great

2082
00:43:01,570 --> 00:43:01,580
architecture we thought that's a great
 

2083
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:03,640
architecture we thought that's a great
idea and then we started supporting it

2084
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:03,650
idea and then we started supporting it
 

2085
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:05,829
idea and then we started supporting it
and tried to make it happen so this was

2086
00:43:05,829 --> 00:43:05,839
and tried to make it happen so this was
 

2087
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:08,380
and tried to make it happen so this was
you know kind we accidentally stumbled

2088
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:08,390
you know kind we accidentally stumbled
 

2089
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:11,230
you know kind we accidentally stumbled
into this and to this need in our timing

2090
00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:11,240
into this and to this need in our timing
 

2091
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,930
into this and to this need in our timing
was good and so it's really taking off

2092
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:13,940
was good and so it's really taking off
 

2093
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:17,890
was good and so it's really taking off
there's a you know universities are good

2094
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:17,900
there's a you know universities are good
 

2095
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:19,120
there's a you know universities are good
at starting things but the not good it's

2096
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:19,130
at starting things but the not good it's
 

2097
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:21,550
at starting things but the not good it's
sustaining things so like Linux has the

2098
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:21,560
sustaining things so like Linux has the
 

2099
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,230
sustaining things so like Linux has the
Linux Foundation there's a risk 5

2100
00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:23,240
Linux Foundation there's a risk 5
 

2101
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:25,570
Linux Foundation there's a risk 5
foundation that we started there's

2102
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:25,580
foundation that we started there's
 

2103
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:28,000
foundation that we started there's
there's an annual conferences and the

2104
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:28,010
there's an annual conferences and the
 

2105
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:31,510
there's an annual conferences and the
first one was done I think January 2015

2106
00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:31,520
first one was done I think January 2015
 

2107
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:32,829
first one was done I think January 2015
and the one that was just last December

2108
00:43:32,829 --> 00:43:32,839
and the one that was just last December
 

2109
00:43:32,839 --> 00:43:35,290
and the one that was just last December
in it you know it had 50 people at it

2110
00:43:35,290 --> 00:43:35,300
in it you know it had 50 people at it
 

2111
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:38,020
in it you know it had 50 people at it
and the last one last December had kind

2112
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:38,030
and the last one last December had kind
 

2113
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:41,410
and the last one last December had kind
of 1,700 people were at it and the

2114
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:41,420
of 1,700 people were at it and the
 

2115
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:43,630
of 1,700 people were at it and the
companies excited all over the world

2116
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:43,640
companies excited all over the world
 

2117
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:46,420
companies excited all over the world
so if predicting into the future you

2118
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:46,430
so if predicting into the future you
 

2119
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:48,250
so if predicting into the future you
know if we were doing 25 years I would

2120
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:48,260
know if we were doing 25 years I would
 

2121
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:50,890
know if we were doing 25 years I would
predict that risk 5 will be you know

2122
00:43:50,890 --> 00:43:50,900
predict that risk 5 will be you know
 

2123
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:54,099
predict that risk 5 will be you know
possibly the most popular instruction

2124
00:43:54,099 --> 00:43:54,109
possibly the most popular instruction
 

2125
00:43:54,109 --> 00:43:56,920
possibly the most popular instruction
set architecture out there because it's

2126
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:56,930
set architecture out there because it's
 

2127
00:43:56,930 --> 00:43:58,000
set architecture out there because it's
a pretty good instruction set

2128
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:58,010
a pretty good instruction set
 

2129
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:59,859
a pretty good instruction set
architecture and it's open and free and

2130
00:43:59,859 --> 00:43:59,869
architecture and it's open and free and
 

2131
00:43:59,869 --> 00:44:02,260
architecture and it's open and free and
there's no reason

2132
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:02,270
there's no reason
 

2133
00:44:02,270 --> 00:44:04,810
there's no reason
lots of people shouldn't use it and

2134
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:04,820
lots of people shouldn't use it and
 

2135
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:08,170
lots of people shouldn't use it and
there's benefits just like Linux is so

2136
00:44:08,170 --> 00:44:08,180
there's benefits just like Linux is so
 

2137
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:11,460
there's benefits just like Linux is so
popular today compared to 20 years ago I

2138
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:11,470
popular today compared to 20 years ago I
 

2139
00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:14,890
popular today compared to 20 years ago I
and you know the fact that you can get

2140
00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:14,900
and you know the fact that you can get
 

2141
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:17,080
and you know the fact that you can get
access to it for free you can modify it

2142
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:17,090
access to it for free you can modify it
 

2143
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:18,730
access to it for free you can modify it
you can improve it for all those same

2144
00:44:18,730 --> 00:44:18,740
you can improve it for all those same
 

2145
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:21,550
you can improve it for all those same
arguments and so people collaborate to

2146
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:21,560
arguments and so people collaborate to
 

2147
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:22,840
arguments and so people collaborate to
make it a better system for all

2148
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:22,850
make it a better system for all
 

2149
00:44:22,850 --> 00:44:24,430
make it a better system for all
everybody to use and that works in

2150
00:44:24,430 --> 00:44:24,440
everybody to use and that works in
 

2151
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:26,260
everybody to use and that works in
software and I expect the same thing

2152
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:26,270
software and I expect the same thing
 

2153
00:44:26,270 --> 00:44:28,600
software and I expect the same thing
will happen in hardware so if you look

2154
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:28,610
will happen in hardware so if you look
 

2155
00:44:28,610 --> 00:44:32,170
will happen in hardware so if you look
at arm Intel mips if you look at just

2156
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:32,180
at arm Intel mips if you look at just
 

2157
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:35,650
at arm Intel mips if you look at just
the lay of the land and what do you

2158
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:35,660
the lay of the land and what do you
 

2159
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:39,330
the lay of the land and what do you
think just for me because I'm not

2160
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:39,340
think just for me because I'm not
 

2161
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:41,620
think just for me because I'm not
familiar how difficult this kind of

2162
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:41,630
familiar how difficult this kind of
 

2163
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:45,760
familiar how difficult this kind of
transition would how much challenges

2164
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:45,770
transition would how much challenges
 

2165
00:44:45,770 --> 00:44:48,220
transition would how much challenges
this kind of transition would entail do

2166
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:48,230
this kind of transition would entail do
 

2167
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:51,910
this kind of transition would entail do
you see let me ask my dumb question

2168
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:51,920
you see let me ask my dumb question
 

2169
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,800
you see let me ask my dumb question
another one no that's I know where

2170
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:53,810
another one no that's I know where
 

2171
00:44:53,810 --> 00:44:56,320
another one no that's I know where
you're headed well there's a budget I

2172
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:56,330
you're headed well there's a budget I
 

2173
00:44:56,330 --> 00:44:57,550
you're headed well there's a budget I
think the thing you point out there's

2174
00:44:57,550 --> 00:44:57,560
think the thing you point out there's
 

2175
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:59,470
think the thing you point out there's
there's these proprietary popular

there's these proprietary popular
 

2177
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:02,290
there's these proprietary popular
proprietary instruction sets the x86 and

proprietary instruction sets the x86 and
so how do we move to risk five

2180
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:04,370
so how do we move to risk five
 

2181
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:07,480
so how do we move to risk five

2193
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:27,220
part of it a big piece of it is the
software stack and what right now

2194
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:27,230
software stack and what right now
 

2195
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:28,690
software stack and what right now
looking forward there seem to be three

2196
00:45:28,690 --> 00:45:28,700
looking forward there seem to be three
 

2197
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:33,460
looking forward there seem to be three
important markets there's the cloud and

2198
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:33,470
important markets there's the cloud and
 

2199
00:45:33,470 --> 00:45:36,820
important markets there's the cloud and
then the cloud is simply companies like

2200
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:36,830
then the cloud is simply companies like
 

2201
00:45:36,830 --> 00:45:41,100
then the cloud is simply companies like
Alibaba and Amazon and Google Microsoft

2202
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:41,110
Alibaba and Amazon and Google Microsoft
 

2203
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:43,960
Alibaba and Amazon and Google Microsoft
having these giant data centers with

2204
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:43,970
having these giant data centers with
 

2205
00:45:43,970 --> 00:45:46,960
having these giant data centers with
tens of thousands of servers in maybe a

2206
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:46,970
tens of thousands of servers in maybe a
 

2207
00:45:46,970 --> 00:45:48,970
tens of thousands of servers in maybe a
hunt maybe a hundred of these data

2208
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:48,980
hunt maybe a hundred of these data
 

2209
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:50,590
hunt maybe a hundred of these data
centers all over the world and that's

2210
00:45:50,590 --> 00:45:50,600
centers all over the world and that's
 

2211
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,450
centers all over the world and that's
what the cloud is so the computer that

2212
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:52,460
what the cloud is so the computer that
 

2213
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:54,750
what the cloud is so the computer that
dominates the cloud is the x86

2214
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:54,760
dominates the cloud is the x86
 

2215
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:57,100
dominates the cloud is the x86
instruction set so the instructions are

2216
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:57,110
instruction set so the instructions are
 

2217
00:45:57,110 --> 00:45:58,630
instruction set so the instructions are
the vocal instructor sets using the

2218
00:45:58,630 --> 00:45:58,640
the vocal instructor sets using the
 

2219
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:02,140
the vocal instructor sets using the
cloud of the x86 almost almost 100% of

2220
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:02,150
cloud of the x86 almost almost 100% of
 

2221
00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:06,250
cloud of the x86 almost almost 100% of
that today is x86 the other big thing

2222
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:06,260
that today is x86 the other big thing
 

2223
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:10,000
that today is x86 the other big thing
are cell phones and laptops those are

2224
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:10,010
are cell phones and laptops those are
 

2225
00:46:10,010 --> 00:46:12,490
are cell phones and laptops those are
the big things today I mean the PC is

2226
00:46:12,490 --> 00:46:12,500
the big things today I mean the PC is
 

2227
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,830
the big things today I mean the PC is
also dominated by the x86 instruction

2228
00:46:14,830 --> 00:46:14,840
also dominated by the x86 instruction
 

2229
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:15,700
also dominated by the x86 instruction
set but those

2230
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:15,710
set but those
 

2231
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:17,829
set but those
sales are dwindling you know there's

2232
00:46:17,829 --> 00:46:17,839
sales are dwindling you know there's
 

2233
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:20,650
sales are dwindling you know there's
maybe 200 million pcs a year and there's

2234
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:20,660
maybe 200 million pcs a year and there's
 

2235
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:23,230
maybe 200 million pcs a year and there's
I serve one and a half billion phones a

2236
00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:23,240
I serve one and a half billion phones a
 

2237
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:25,960
I serve one and a half billion phones a
year there's numbers like that so for

2238
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:25,970
year there's numbers like that so for
 

2239
00:46:25,970 --> 00:46:29,430
year there's numbers like that so for
the phones that's dominated by arm and

2240
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:29,440
the phones that's dominated by arm and
 

2241
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:34,570
the phones that's dominated by arm and
now and a reason that I talked about the

2242
00:46:34,570 --> 00:46:34,580
now and a reason that I talked about the
 

2243
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:36,670
now and a reason that I talked about the
software stacks and then the third

2244
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:36,680
software stacks and then the third
 

2245
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:38,440
software stacks and then the third
category is Internet of Things which is

2246
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:38,450
category is Internet of Things which is
 

2247
00:46:38,450 --> 00:46:39,940
category is Internet of Things which is
basically embedded devices things in

2248
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:39,950
basically embedded devices things in
 

2249
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:42,300
basically embedded devices things in
your cars and your microwaves everywhere

2250
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:42,310
your cars and your microwaves everywhere
 

2251
00:46:42,310 --> 00:46:44,890
your cars and your microwaves everywhere
so what's different about those three

2252
00:46:44,890 --> 00:46:44,900
so what's different about those three
 

2253
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:48,609
so what's different about those three
categories is for the cloud the software

2254
00:46:48,609 --> 00:46:48,619
categories is for the cloud the software
 

2255
00:46:48,619 --> 00:46:50,050
categories is for the cloud the software
that runs in the cloud is determined by

2256
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:50,060
that runs in the cloud is determined by
 

2257
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:53,109
that runs in the cloud is determined by
these companies Alibaba Amazon Google

2258
00:46:53,109 --> 00:46:53,119
these companies Alibaba Amazon Google
 

2259
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:55,420
these companies Alibaba Amazon Google
Microsoft so that they control that

2260
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:55,430
Microsoft so that they control that
 

2261
00:46:55,430 --> 00:46:57,730
Microsoft so that they control that
software stack for the cell phones

2262
00:46:57,730 --> 00:46:57,740
software stack for the cell phones
 

2263
00:46:57,740 --> 00:47:01,210
software stack for the cell phones
there's both for Android and Apple the

2264
00:47:01,210 --> 00:47:01,220
there's both for Android and Apple the
 

2265
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:03,099
there's both for Android and Apple the
software they supply but both of them

2266
00:47:03,099 --> 00:47:03,109
software they supply but both of them
 

2267
00:47:03,109 --> 00:47:04,990
software they supply but both of them
have marketplaces where anybody in the

2268
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:05,000
have marketplaces where anybody in the
 

2269
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,300
have marketplaces where anybody in the
world can build software and that

2270
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:07,310
world can build software and that
 

2271
00:47:07,310 --> 00:47:10,630
world can build software and that
software is translated or you know

2272
00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:10,640
software is translated or you know
 

2273
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:13,480
software is translated or you know
compiled down and shipped in the

2274
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:13,490
compiled down and shipped in the
 

2275
00:47:13,490 --> 00:47:16,270
compiled down and shipped in the
vocabulary of arm so that's the the

2276
00:47:16,270 --> 00:47:16,280
vocabulary of arm so that's the the
 

2277
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:18,280
vocabulary of arm so that's the the
what's referred to as binary compatible

2278
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:18,290
what's referred to as binary compatible
 

2279
00:47:18,290 --> 00:47:21,220
what's referred to as binary compatible
because the actual it's the instructions

2280
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:21,230
because the actual it's the instructions
 

2281
00:47:21,230 --> 00:47:23,920
because the actual it's the instructions
are turned into numbers binary numbers

2282
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:23,930
are turned into numbers binary numbers
 

2283
00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:25,599
are turned into numbers binary numbers
and shipped around the world so and the

2284
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:25,609
and shipped around the world so and the
 

2285
00:47:25,609 --> 00:47:27,700
and shipped around the world so and the
size just a quick interruption so arm

2286
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:27,710
size just a quick interruption so arm
 

2287
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:31,450
size just a quick interruption so arm
what is arm as arm is an instructions

2288
00:47:31,450 --> 00:47:31,460
what is arm as arm is an instructions
 

2289
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:33,400
what is arm as arm is an instructions
like a risk-based yeah it's a risk-based

2290
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:33,410
like a risk-based yeah it's a risk-based
 

2291
00:47:33,410 --> 00:47:35,500
like a risk-based yeah it's a risk-based
instruction as a proprietary one arm

the name where the company is so it's a

2296
00:47:42,849 --> 00:47:42,859
the name where the company is so it's a
 

2297
00:47:42,859 --> 00:47:46,390
the name where the company is so it's a
proprietary RISC architecture so and

2298
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:46,400
proprietary RISC architecture so and
 

2299
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,880
proprietary RISC architecture so and
it's been around for a while and you

2300
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:48,890
it's been around for a while and you

using the arm design in this post PC era

2308
00:47:57,820 --> 00:47:57,830
using the arm design in this post PC era
 

2309
00:47:57,830 --> 00:48:00,190
using the arm design in this post PC era
is what it was the one of the early risk

2310
00:48:00,190 --> 00:48:00,200
is what it was the one of the early risk
 

2311
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:03,099
is what it was the one of the early risk
adopters of the risk yeah yeah the first

2312
00:48:03,099 --> 00:48:03,109
adopters of the risk yeah yeah the first
 

2313
00:48:03,109 --> 00:48:05,740
adopters of the risk yeah yeah the first
arm goes back I don't know 86 or so so

2314
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:05,750
arm goes back I don't know 86 or so so
 

2315
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:07,570
arm goes back I don't know 86 or so so
Berkeley instead did their work in the

2316
00:48:07,570 --> 00:48:07,580
Berkeley instead did their work in the
 

2317
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:10,870
Berkeley instead did their work in the
early 80s their arm guys needed an

2318
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:10,880
early 80s their arm guys needed an
 

2319
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:13,150
early 80s their arm guys needed an
instruction set and they read our papers

2320
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:13,160
instruction set and they read our papers
 

2321
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:17,380
instruction set and they read our papers
and it heavily influenced them so

2322
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:17,390
and it heavily influenced them so
 

2323
00:48:17,390 --> 00:48:18,400
and it heavily influenced them so
getting back my story what about

the embedded device people control that
 

2331
00:48:25,550 --> 00:48:28,870
the embedded device people control that
software stack so you would the

sense why risk five our arm is dominated

2384
00:49:27,609 --> 00:49:27,619
sense why risk five our arm is dominated
 

2385
00:49:27,619 --> 00:49:29,230
sense why risk five our arm is dominated
you mentioned these three categories why

2386
00:49:29,230 --> 00:49:29,240
you mentioned these three categories why
 

2387
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:31,870
you mentioned these three categories why
has why did arm dominate why does it

2388
00:49:31,870 --> 00:49:31,880
has why did arm dominate why does it
 

2389
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:33,789
has why did arm dominate why does it
dominate the mobile device base and

2390
00:49:33,789 --> 00:49:33,799
dominate the mobile device base and
 

2391
00:49:33,799 --> 00:49:38,140
dominate the mobile device base and
maybe the my naive intuition is that

2392
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:38,150
maybe the my naive intuition is that
 

2393
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:39,400
maybe the my naive intuition is that
there are some aspects of power

2394
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:39,410
there are some aspects of power
 

2395
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:41,349
there are some aspects of power
efficiency that are important yeah that

2396
00:49:41,349 --> 00:49:41,359
efficiency that are important yeah that
 

2397
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:43,630
efficiency that are important yeah that
somehow come along with risk well part

00:49:53,470 --> 00:49:53,480
that's like in the x86 it it was more
 

2403
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:57,520
that's like in the x86 it it was more
expensive to these for the you know

2463
00:51:01,970 --> 00:51:05,290
phones too so it I think it's believed
that there's a energy disadvantage of

you know will license use to do that or

2504
00:51:58,120 --> 00:51:58,130
you know will license use to do that or
 

2505
00:51:58,130 --> 00:52:00,820
you know will license use to do that or
you could design your own and so we're

2506
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:00,830
you could design your own and so we're
 

2507
00:52:00,830 --> 00:52:03,190
you could design your own and so we're
talking about numbers like tens of

2508
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:03,200
talking about numbers like tens of
 

2509
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,690
talking about numbers like tens of
millions of dollars to have the right to

2510
00:52:04,690 --> 00:52:04,700
millions of dollars to have the right to
 

2511
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:06,910
millions of dollars to have the right to
design your own since they it's the

2512
00:52:06,910 --> 00:52:06,920
design your own since they it's the
 

2513
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:09,460
design your own since they it's the
instruction set belongs to them so Apple

2514
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:09,470
instruction set belongs to them so Apple
 

2515
00:52:09,470 --> 00:52:12,280
instruction set belongs to them so Apple
got one of those the right to build

2516
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:12,290
got one of those the right to build
 

2517
00:52:12,290 --> 00:52:14,410
got one of those the right to build
their own most of the other people who

2518
00:52:14,410 --> 00:52:14,420
their own most of the other people who
 

2519
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:17,500
their own most of the other people who
build like Android phones just get one

2520
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:17,510
build like Android phones just get one
 

2521
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:20,530
build like Android phones just get one
of the designs from arm and to do it

2522
00:52:20,530 --> 00:52:20,540
of the designs from arm and to do it
 

2523
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:21,250
of the designs from arm and to do it
themselves

2524
00:52:21,250 --> 00:52:21,260
themselves
 

2525
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:24,330
themselves
so Apple developed a really good

2526
00:52:24,330 --> 00:52:24,340
so Apple developed a really good
 

2527
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:28,060
so Apple developed a really good
microprocessor design team they you know

2528
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:28,070
microprocessor design team they you know
 

2529
00:52:28,070 --> 00:52:31,330
microprocessor design team they you know
acquired a very good team that had was a

2530
00:52:31,330 --> 00:52:31,340
acquired a very good team that had was a
 

2531
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:33,340
acquired a very good team that had was a
building other microprocessors and

2532
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:33,350
building other microprocessors and
 

2533
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:34,840
building other microprocessors and
brought them into the company to build

2534
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:34,850
brought them into the company to build
 

2535
00:52:34,850 --> 00:52:37,570
brought them into the company to build
their designs so the instruction sets

2536
00:52:37,570 --> 00:52:37,580
their designs so the instruction sets
 

2537
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:39,130
their designs so the instruction sets
are the same the specifications are the

2538
00:52:39,130 --> 00:52:39,140
are the same the specifications are the
 

2539
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:42,010
are the same the specifications are the
same but their hardware design is much

2540
00:52:42,010 --> 00:52:42,020
same but their hardware design is much
 

2541
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:43,630
same but their hardware design is much
more efficient than I think everybody

2542
00:52:43,630 --> 00:52:43,640
more efficient than I think everybody
 

2543
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:48,010
more efficient than I think everybody
else's and that's given Apple an

2544
00:52:48,010 --> 00:52:48,020
else's and that's given Apple an
 

2545
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:49,859
else's and that's given Apple an
advantage in the marketplace and that

2546
00:52:49,859 --> 00:52:49,869
advantage in the marketplace and that
 

2547
00:52:49,869 --> 00:52:54,340
advantage in the marketplace and that
the iPhones tend to be the faster than

2548
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:54,350
the iPhones tend to be the faster than
 

2549
00:52:54,350 --> 00:52:56,530
the iPhones tend to be the faster than
most everybody else's phones that are

2550
00:52:56,530 --> 00:52:56,540
most everybody else's phones that are
 

2551
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:56,980
most everybody else's phones that are
they

2552
00:52:56,980 --> 00:52:56,990
they
 

2553
00:52:56,990 --> 00:52:59,720
they
it'd be nice to be able to jump around

2554
00:52:59,720 --> 00:52:59,730
it'd be nice to be able to jump around
 

2555
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:01,760
it'd be nice to be able to jump around
and kind of explore different little

2556
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:01,770
and kind of explore different little
 

2557
00:53:01,770 --> 00:53:04,340
and kind of explore different little
sides of this but let me ask one sort of

2558
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:04,350
sides of this but let me ask one sort of
 

2559
00:53:04,350 --> 00:53:06,490
sides of this but let me ask one sort of
romanticized question what to you is the

2560
00:53:06,490 --> 00:53:06,500
romanticized question what to you is the
 

2561
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:10,190
romanticized question what to you is the
most beautiful aspect or idea of risk

2562
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:10,200
most beautiful aspect or idea of risk
 

2563
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:12,560
most beautiful aspect or idea of risk
instruction set or instruction sets for

I I'm you know I I was always attracted
 

2569
00:53:18,330 --> 00:53:20,420
I I'm you know I I was always attracted
to the idea of you know smallest

00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:20,430
to the idea of you know smallest
 

2571
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:23,900
to the idea of you know smallest
beautiful why is that the temptation in

2572
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:23,910
beautiful why is that the temptation in
 

2573
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:26,420
beautiful why is that the temptation in
engineering it's kind of easy to make

2574
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:26,430
engineering it's kind of easy to make
 

2575
00:53:26,430 --> 00:53:28,880
engineering it's kind of easy to make
things more complicated it's harder to

2576
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:28,890
things more complicated it's harder to
 

2577
00:53:28,890 --> 00:53:30,950
things more complicated it's harder to
come up with a it's more difficult

2578
00:53:30,950 --> 00:53:30,960
come up with a it's more difficult
 

2579
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:32,810
come up with a it's more difficult
surprising they come up with a simple

2580
00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:32,820
surprising they come up with a simple
 

2581
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:35,330
surprising they come up with a simple
elegant solution and I think that

2582
00:53:35,330 --> 00:53:35,340
elegant solution and I think that
 

2583
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:37,430
elegant solution and I think that
there's a bunch of small features of of

2584
00:53:37,430 --> 00:53:37,440
there's a bunch of small features of of
 

2585
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:41,120
there's a bunch of small features of of
risk in general that you know where you

00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:41,130
risk in general that you know where you
 

2587
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:43,640
risk in general that you know where you
can see this examples of keeping it

2588
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:43,650
can see this examples of keeping it
 

2589
00:53:43,650 --> 00:53:45,340
can see this examples of keeping it
simpler makes it more elegant

2590
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:45,350
simpler makes it more elegant
 

2591
00:53:45,350 --> 00:53:47,930
simpler makes it more elegant
specifically in risk five which you know

2592
00:53:47,930 --> 00:53:47,940
specifically in risk five which you know

00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:49,580
specifically in risk five which you know
I'm I was kind of the mentor in the

I'm I was kind of the mentor in the
 

2595
00:53:49,590 --> 00:53:50,840
I'm I was kind of the mentor in the
program but it was really driven by

they hit upon this idea of having a

2602
00:54:00,290 --> 00:54:00,300
they hit upon this idea of having a
 

2603
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:04,130
they hit upon this idea of having a
subset of instructions a nice simple

2604
00:54:04,130 --> 00:54:04,140
subset of instructions a nice simple
 

2605
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:05,420
subset of instructions a nice simple
instruction subset instructions like

2606
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:05,430
instruction subset instructions like
 

2607
00:54:05,430 --> 00:54:09,460
instruction subset instructions like
40-ish instructions that all software

2608
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:09,470
40-ish instructions that all software
 

2609
00:54:09,470 --> 00:54:12,440
40-ish instructions that all software
the software status v can run just on

2610
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:12,450
the software status v can run just on
 

2611
00:54:12,450 --> 00:54:14,480
the software status v can run just on
those forty instructions and then they

2612
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:14,490
those forty instructions and then they
 

2613
00:54:14,490 --> 00:54:17,450
those forty instructions and then they
provide optional features that could

2614
00:54:17,450 --> 00:54:17,460
provide optional features that could
 

2615
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:20,660
provide optional features that could
accelerate the performance instructions

2616
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:20,670
accelerate the performance instructions
 

2617
00:54:20,670 --> 00:54:22,310
accelerate the performance instructions
that if you needed them could be very

2618
00:54:22,310 --> 00:54:22,320
that if you needed them could be very
 

2619
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:24,170
that if you needed them could be very
helpful but you don't need to have them

2620
00:54:24,170 --> 00:54:24,180
helpful but you don't need to have them
 

2621
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:26,690
helpful but you don't need to have them
and that that's a new really a new idea

2622
00:54:26,690 --> 00:54:26,700
and that that's a new really a new idea
 

2623
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:29,840
and that that's a new really a new idea
so risk five has right now maybe five

2624
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:29,850
so risk five has right now maybe five
 

2625
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:32,750
so risk five has right now maybe five
optional subsets that you can pull in

2626
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:32,760
optional subsets that you can pull in
 

2627
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:34,610
optional subsets that you can pull in
but the software runs without them if

2628
00:54:34,610 --> 00:54:34,620
but the software runs without them if
 

2629
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:37,310
but the software runs without them if
you just want to build the just the core

2630
00:54:37,310 --> 00:54:37,320
you just want to build the just the core
 

2631
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:39,380
you just want to build the just the core
forty instructions that's fine you can

2632
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:39,390
forty instructions that's fine you can
 

2633
00:54:39,390 --> 00:54:42,220
forty instructions that's fine you can
do that so this is fantastic

2634
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:42,230
do that so this is fantastic
 

2635
00:54:42,230 --> 00:54:44,210
do that so this is fantastic
educationally is so you can explain

2636
00:54:44,210 --> 00:54:44,220
educationally is so you can explain
 

2637
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:45,980
educationally is so you can explain
computers you only have to explain forty

2638

computers you only have to explain forty
 

2639
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:48,440
computers you only have to explain forty
instructions and not thousands of them

2640
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:48,450
instructions and not thousands of them
 

2641
00:54:48,450 --> 00:54:50,990
instructions and not thousands of them
also if you invent some wild and crazy

2642
00:54:50,990 --> 00:54:51,000
also if you invent some wild and crazy
 

2643
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,320
also if you invent some wild and crazy
new technology like you know biological

2647
00:54:57,090 --> 00:55:00,560
computing you'd like a nice simple
instruction set and you can risk 5e if

2648
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:00,570
instruction set and you can risk 5e if
 

2649
00:55:00,570 --> 00:55:01,970

you implement those core instructions

2650
00:55:01,970 --> 00:55:01,980
you implement those core instructions
 

2651
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:03,640
you implement those core instructions
you can run you know really interesting

you can run you know really interesting
 

2653
00:55:03,650 --> 00:55:06,050
you can run you know really interesting
programs on top of that so this idea of

2654
00:55:06,050 --> 00:55:06,060
programs on top of that so this idea of
 

2655
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:08,120
programs on top of that so this idea of
a core set of instructions that the

00:55:12,769 --> 00:55:12,779
and then optional features that if you
 

2661
00:55:12,779 --> 00:55:14,359
and then optional features that if you
turn them on the compilers where used

2662
00:55:14,359 --> 00:55:14,369
turn them on the compilers where used
 

2663
00:55:14,369 --> 00:55:16,009
turn them on the compilers where used
but you don't have to I think is a

2664
00:55:16,009 --> 00:55:16,019
but you don't have to I think is a
 

2665
00:55:16,019 --> 00:55:18,979
but you don't have to I think is a
powerful idea what's happened in the

2666
00:55:18,979 --> 00:55:18,989
powerful idea what's happened in the
 

2667
00:55:18,989 --> 00:55:21,289
powerful idea what's happened in the
past if for the proprietary instruction

2668
00:55:21,289 --> 00:55:21,299
past if for the proprietary instruction
 

2669
00:55:21,299 --> 00:55:24,950
past if for the proprietary instruction
sets is when they add new instructions

2670
00:55:24,950 --> 00:55:24,960
sets is when they add new instructions
 

2671
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:28,370
sets is when they add new instructions
it becomes required piece and so that

2672
00:55:28,370 --> 00:55:28,380
it becomes required piece and so that
 

2673
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:31,579
it becomes required piece and so that
all all microprocessors in the future

2674
00:55:31,579 --> 00:55:31,589
all all microprocessors in the future
 

2675
00:55:31,589 --> 00:55:33,799
all all microprocessors in the future
have to use those instructions so it's

2676
00:55:33,799 --> 00:55:33,809
have to use those instructions so it's
 

2677
00:55:33,809 --> 00:55:35,749
have to use those instructions so it's
kind of like is for a lot of people as

2678
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:35,759
kind of like is for a lot of people as
 

2679
00:55:35,759 --> 00:55:37,460
kind of like is for a lot of people as
they get older they gain weight

2680
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:37,470
they get older they gain weight
 

2681
00:55:37,470 --> 00:55:40,279
they get older they gain weight
all right is it that weight and age are

2682
00:55:40,279 --> 00:55:40,289
all right is it that weight and age are
 

2683
00:55:40,289 --> 00:55:42,229
all right is it that weight and age are
correlated and so you can see these

2684
00:55:42,229 --> 00:55:42,239
correlated and so you can see these
 

2685
00:55:42,239 --> 00:55:44,089
correlated and so you can see these
instruction sets get getting bigger and

2686
00:55:44,089 --> 00:55:44,099
instruction sets get getting bigger and
 

2687
00:55:44,099 --> 00:55:46,039
instruction sets get getting bigger and
bigger as they get older so risk five

2688
00:55:46,039 --> 00:55:46,049
bigger as they get older so risk five
 

2689
00:55:46,049 --> 00:55:49,370
bigger as they get older so risk five
you know let's you be as slim as your as

2690
00:55:49,370 --> 00:55:49,380
you know let's you be as slim as your as
 

2691
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:50,900
you know let's you be as slim as your as
a teenager and you only have to add

2692
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:50,910
a teenager and you only have to add
 

2693
00:55:50,910 --> 00:55:53,180
a teenager and you only have to add
these extra features if you're really

2694
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:53,190
these extra features if you're really
 

2695
00:55:53,190 --> 00:55:54,890
these extra features if you're really
gonna use them rather than every you

2696
00:55:54,890 --> 00:55:54,900
gonna use them rather than every you
 

2697
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:56,479
gonna use them rather than every you
have no choice you have to keep growing

2698
00:55:56,479 --> 00:55:56,489
have no choice you have to keep growing
 

2699
00:55:56,489 --> 00:55:58,700
have no choice you have to keep growing
with the instruction set I don't know if

2700
00:55:58,700 --> 00:55:58,710
with the instruction set I don't know if
 

2701
00:55:58,710 --> 00:56:00,049
with the instruction set I don't know if
the analogy holds out but that's a

2702
00:56:00,049 --> 00:56:00,059
the analogy holds out but that's a
 

2703
00:56:00,059 --> 00:56:03,259
the analogy holds out but that's a
beautiful notion that there's it's

2704
00:56:03,259 --> 00:56:03,269
beautiful notion that there's it's
 

2705
00:56:03,269 --> 00:56:04,970
beautiful notion that there's it's
almost like a nudge towards here's the

almost like a nudge towards here's the
 

2707
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:07,880
almost like a nudge towards here's the
simple core that's the essential yeah I

2708
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:07,890

2709
00:56:07,890 --> 00:56:10,249

think the surprising thing is still if

2710
00:56:10,249 --> 00:56:10,259
think the surprising thing is still if
 

2711
00:56:10,259 --> 00:56:12,259
think the surprising thing is still if
we if we brought back you know the

00:56:12,259 --> 00:56:12,269
we if we brought back you know the
 

2713
00:56:12,269 --> 00:56:14,359
we if we brought back you know the
pioneers from the 1950s and showed them

2714
00:56:14,359 --> 00:56:14,369
pioneers from the 1950s and showed them
 

2715
00:56:14,369 --> 00:56:16,160
pioneers from the 1950s and showed them
the instruction set architectures they'd

that different well you know I'm
 

2721
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:23,359
that different well you know I'm
surprised and it's if there's it may be

2722
00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:23,369
surprised and it's if there's it may be
 

2723
00:56:23,369 --> 00:56:24,799
surprised and it's if there's it may be
something you know to talk about

00:56:26,890 --> 00:56:26,900
philosophical things I mean there may be
 

2727
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:31,819
philosophical things I mean there may be
something powerful about those you know

2728
00:56:31,819 --> 00:56:31,829
something powerful about those you know
 

2729
00:56:31,829 --> 00:56:34,400
something powerful about those you know
forty or fifty instructions that all you

2730
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:34,410
forty or fifty instructions that all you
 

2731
00:56:34,410 --> 00:56:37,099
forty or fifty instructions that all you
need is these commands like these

2732
00:56:37,099 --> 00:56:37,109
need is these commands like these
 

2733
00:56:37,109 --> 00:56:38,539
need is these commands like these
instructions that we talked about and

2734
00:56:38,539 --> 00:56:38,549
instructions that we talked about and
 

2735
00:56:38,549 --> 00:56:42,229
instructions that we talked about and
that is sufficient to build to bring

2736
00:56:42,229 --> 00:56:42,239
that is sufficient to build to bring
 

2737
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:45,019
that is sufficient to build to bring
upon you know artificial intelligence

2738
00:56:45,019 --> 00:56:45,029
upon you know artificial intelligence
 

2739
00:56:45,029 --> 00:56:48,890
upon you know artificial intelligence
and so it's a remarkable surprising to

2740
00:56:48,890 --> 00:56:48,900
and so it's a remarkable surprising to
 

2741
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:54,220
and so it's a remarkable surprising to
me that is complicated

in you know his 25 years in the future
 

2779
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:42,059
in you know his 25 years in the future
and his turned out about when I was a

2780
00:57:42,059 --> 00:57:42,069
and his turned out about when I was a
 

2781
00:57:42,069 --> 00:57:43,739
and his turned out about when I was a
young professor and he said yep

2782
00:57:43,739 --> 00:57:43,749
young professor and he said yep
 

2783
00:57:43,749 --> 00:57:45,539
young professor and he said yep
I checked it I was interest to see how

2784
00:57:45,539 --> 00:57:45,549
I checked it I was interest to see how
 

2785
00:57:45,549 --> 00:57:48,239
I checked it I was interest to see how
that was going to turn out for me and

2786
00:57:48,239 --> 00:57:48,249
that was going to turn out for me and
 

2787
00:57:48,249 --> 00:57:51,420
that was going to turn out for me and
it's pretty held up pretty well but yeah

2788
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:51,430
it's pretty held up pretty well but yeah
 

2789
00:57:51,430 --> 00:57:52,890
it's pretty held up pretty well but yeah
so there's there's probably there's

00:57:52,890 --> 00:57:52,900
so there's there's probably there's
 

2791
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:55,200
so there's there's probably there's

00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:55,210
something I you know there's there must

00:57:55,210 --> 00:57:57,630
something I you know there's there must
be something fundamental about those

2794
00:57:57,630 --> 00:57:57,640
be something fundamental about those

00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:10,210
doing them really fast you kind of
 

2803
00:58:10,210 --> 00:58:12,690
doing them really fast you kind of

there's other ideas so there's a lot of
 

2809
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:20,849
there's other ideas so there's a lot of

00:58:26,190 --> 00:58:26,200
different mediums and types of
 

2817
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:28,200
different mediums and types of
computation what's the connection

2818
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:28,210
computation what's the connection
 

2819
00:58:28,210 --> 00:58:32,849
computation what's the connection
between swapping out different Hardware

2820
00:58:32,849 --> 00:58:32,859
between swapping out different Hardware
 

2821
00:58:32,859 --> 00:58:34,920
between swapping out different Hardware
systems and the instruction set do you

2822
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:34,930
systems and the instruction set do you
 

2823
00:58:34,930 --> 00:58:36,269
systems and the instruction set do you
see those as disjoint or they

2824
00:58:36,269 --> 00:58:36,279
see those as disjoint or they
 

2825
00:58:36,279 --> 00:58:38,819
see those as disjoint or they
fundamentally coupled yeah so what's so

2826
00:58:38,819 --> 00:58:38,829
fundamentally coupled yeah so what's so
 

2827
00:58:38,829 --> 00:58:42,799
fundamentally coupled yeah so what's so
kind of if we go back to the history you

2828
00:58:42,799 --> 00:58:42,809
kind of if we go back to the history you
 

2829
00:58:42,809 --> 00:58:45,029
kind of if we go back to the history you
know when Moore's Law is in full effect

2830
00:58:45,029 --> 00:58:45,039
know when Moore's Law is in full effect
 

2831
00:58:45,039 --> 00:58:47,039
know when Moore's Law is in full effect
and you're getting twice as many

2832
00:58:47,039 --> 00:58:47,049
and you're getting twice as many
 

2833
00:58:47,049 --> 00:58:49,920
and you're getting twice as many
transistors every couple of years you

2834
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:49,930
transistors every couple of years you
 

2835
00:58:49,930 --> 00:58:52,499
transistors every couple of years you
know kind of the challenge for computer

2836
00:58:52,499 --> 00:58:52,509
know kind of the challenge for computer
 

2837
00:58:52,509 --> 00:58:54,059
know kind of the challenge for computer
designers is how can we take advantage

2838
00:58:54,059 --> 00:58:54,069
designers is how can we take advantage
 

2839
00:58:54,069 --> 00:58:55,410
designers is how can we take advantage
of that how can we turn those

2840
00:58:55,410 --> 00:58:55,420
of that how can we turn those
 

2841
00:58:55,420 --> 00:58:58,529
of that how can we turn those
transistors into better computers faster

2842
00:58:58,529 --> 00:58:58,539
transistors into better computers faster
 

2843
00:58:58,539 --> 00:59:01,069
transistors into better computers faster
typically and so there was an era I

2844
00:59:01,069 --> 00:59:01,079
typically and so there was an era I
 

2845
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:05,039
typically and so there was an era I
guess in the 80s and 90s where computers

2846
00:59:05,039 --> 00:59:05,049
guess in the 80s and 90s where computers
 

2847
00:59:05,049 --> 00:59:08,130
guess in the 80s and 90s where computers
were doubling performance every 18

2848
00:59:08,130 --> 00:59:08,140
were doubling performance every 18
 

2849
00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:10,950
were doubling performance every 18
months and if you weren't around then

2850
00:59:10,950 --> 00:59:10,960
months and if you weren't around then
 

2851
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:14,220
months and if you weren't around then
what would happen is you had your

2852
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:14,230
what would happen is you had your
 

2853
00:59:14,230 --> 00:59:16,890
what would happen is you had your
computer and your friend's computer

2854
00:59:16,890 --> 00:59:16,900
computer and your friend's computer
 

2855
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:19,170
computer and your friend's computer
which was like a year year and a half

2856
00:59:19,170 --> 00:59:19,180
which was like a year year and a half
 

2857
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:21,479
which was like a year year and a half
newer and it was much faster than your

2858
00:59:21,479 --> 00:59:21,489
newer and it was much faster than your
 

2859
00:59:21,489 --> 00:59:23,700
newer and it was much faster than your
computer and you he he or she could get

2860
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:23,710
computer and you he he or she could get
 

2861
00:59:23,710 --> 00:59:25,650
computer and you he he or she could get
their work done much faster than your

2862
00:59:25,650 --> 00:59:25,660
their work done much faster than your
 

2863
00:59:25,660 --> 00:59:27,239
their work done much faster than your
typical user so people took their

2864
00:59:27,239 --> 00:59:27,249
typical user so people took their
 

2865
00:59:27,249 --> 00:59:29,069
typical user so people took their
computers perfectly good computers and

2866
00:59:29,069 --> 00:59:29,079
computers perfectly good computers and
 

2867
00:59:29,079 --> 00:59:32,519
computers perfectly good computers and
threw them away to buy a newer computer

2868
00:59:32,519 --> 00:59:32,529
threw them away to buy a newer computer
 

2869
00:59:32,529 --> 00:59:34,710
threw them away to buy a newer computer
because the computer one or two years

2870
00:59:34,710 --> 00:59:34,720
because the computer one or two years
 

2871
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:37,289
because the computer one or two years
later was so much faster so that's what

2872
00:59:37,289 --> 00:59:37,299
later was so much faster so that's what
 

2873
00:59:37,299 --> 00:59:37,470
later was so much faster so that's what
the

2874
00:59:37,470 --> 00:59:37,480
the
 

2875
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:40,830
the
world was like in 80s and 90s well with

00:59:40,830 --> 00:59:40,840
world was like in 80s and 90s well with
 

2877
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:43,710
world was like in 80s and 90s well with
the slowing down of Moore's law that's

2878
00:59:43,710 --> 00:59:43,720
the slowing down of Moore's law that's
 

2879
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:46,050
the slowing down of Moore's law that's
no longer true right he not now with you

2880
00:59:46,050 --> 00:59:46,060
no longer true right he not now with you

laptops I only get a new laptop when it

2884
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:51,130
laptops I only get a new laptop when it
 

2885
00:59:51,130 --> 00:59:53,760
laptops I only get a new laptop when it
breaks right well damn the disk broke or

2886
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:53,770
breaks right well damn the disk broke or
 

2887
00:59:53,770 --> 00:59:55,530
breaks right well damn the disk broke or
this display broke I got to buy a new

2888
00:59:55,530 --> 00:59:55,540
this display broke I got to buy a new
 

2889
00:59:55,540 --> 00:59:57,330
this display broke I got to buy a new
computer but before you would throw them

2890
00:59:57,330 --> 00:59:57,340
computer but before you would throw them
 

2891
00:59:57,340 --> 00:59:59,760
computer but before you would throw them
away because it just they were just so

2892
00:59:59,760 --> 00:59:59,770
away because it just they were just so
 

2893
00:59:59,770 --> 01:00:01,620
away because it just they were just so
sluggish compared to the latest

2894
01:00:01,620 --> 01:00:01,630
sluggish compared to the latest
 

2895
01:00:01,630 --> 01:00:06,000
sluggish compared to the latest
computers so that's you know that's a

2896
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:06,010
computers so that's you know that's a
 

2897
01:00:06,010 --> 01:00:11,250
computers so that's you know that's a
huge change of what's gone on so but yes

2898
01:00:11,250 --> 01:00:11,260
huge change of what's gone on so but yes
 

2899
01:00:11,260 --> 01:00:13,800
huge change of what's gone on so but yes
since this lasted for decades kind of

2900
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:13,810
since this lasted for decades kind of
 

2901
01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:16,560
since this lasted for decades kind of
programmers and maybe all society is

2902
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:16,570
programmers and maybe all society is
 

2903
01:00:16,570 --> 01:00:18,720
programmers and maybe all society is
used to computers getting faster

2904
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:18,730
used to computers getting faster
 

2905
01:00:18,730 --> 01:00:22,440
used to computers getting faster
regularly it we now now believe those of

2906
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:22,450
regularly it we now now believe those of
 

2907
01:00:22,450 --> 01:00:24,120
regularly it we now now believe those of
us who are in computer design it's

2908
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:24,130
us who are in computer design it's
 

2909
01:00:24,130 --> 01:00:26,190
us who are in computer design it's
called computer architecture that the

2910
01:00:26,190 --> 01:00:26,200
called computer architecture that the
 

2911
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:29,240
called computer architecture that the
path forward is instead is to add

2912
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:29,250
path forward is instead is to add
 

2913
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:33,300
path forward is instead is to add
accelerators that only work well for

2914
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:33,310
accelerators that only work well for
 

2915
01:00:33,310 --> 01:00:35,420
accelerators that only work well for
certain applications

2916
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:35,430
certain applications
 

2917
01:00:35,430 --> 01:00:39,290
certain applications
so since Moore's law is slowing down

2918
01:00:39,290 --> 01:00:39,300
so since Moore's law is slowing down
 

2919
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:42,120
so since Moore's law is slowing down
we don't think general-purpose computers

2920
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:42,130
we don't think general-purpose computers
 

2921
01:00:42,130 --> 01:00:44,609
we don't think general-purpose computers
are gonna get a lot faster so the Intel

2922
01:00:44,609 --> 01:00:44,619
are gonna get a lot faster so the Intel
 

2923
01:00:44,619 --> 01:00:46,530
are gonna get a lot faster so the Intel
processors of the world are not going to

01:00:47,980 --> 01:00:51,030
haven't been getting a lot faster
they've been barely improving like a few

2928
01:00:51,030 --> 01:00:51,040
they've been barely improving like a few
 

2929
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:51,570
they've been barely improving like a few
percent a year

2930
01:00:51,570 --> 01:00:51,580
percent a year
 

2931
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:53,910

it used to be doubling your 18 months

2932
01:00:53,910 --> 01:00:53,920
it used to be doubling your 18 months
 

2933
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:56,190
it used to be doubling your 18 months
and now it's doubling every 20 years so

2934
01:00:56,190 --> 01:00:56,200
and now it's doubling every 20 years so
 

2935
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:58,440
and now it's doubling every 20 years so
it was just shocking so to be able to

2936
01:00:58,440 --> 01:00:58,450
it was just shocking so to be able to
 

2937
01:00:58,450 --> 01:01:00,630
it was just shocking so to be able to
deliver on what Moore's law used to do

we think what's going to happen what is
 

2941
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:05,870
we think what's going to happen what is
happening right now is people adding

happening right now is people adding
 

2943
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:08,250
happening right now is people adding

what's happened in the last decade or
eight years this machine learning has

2972
01:01:45,990 --> 01:01:46,000
eight years this machine learning has
 

2973
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,080
eight years this machine learning has
won and it turns out that machine

2974
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:49,090
won and it turns out that machine
 

2975
01:01:49,090 --> 01:01:51,540

01:05:50,730 --> 01:05:50,740
even though we're still going to have
 

3175
01:05:50,740 --> 01:05:53,670
even though we're still going to have
that same basic risk instructions to run

3176
01:05:53,670 --> 01:05:53,680
that same basic risk instructions to run

01:05:55,980 --> 01:05:55,990
a big pieces of the software stack like
 

3179
01:05:55,990 --> 01:05:58,349
a big pieces of the software stack like
user interfaces and stuff like that we

3180
01:05:58,349 --> 01:05:58,359
user interfaces and stuff like that we
 

3181
01:05:58,359 --> 01:06:00,630
user interfaces and stuff like that we
can accelerate the the kind of the small

01:06:00,630 --> 01:06:00,640
can accelerate the the kind of the small
 

3183
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:02,250
can accelerate the the kind of the small
piece that's computationally intensive

3184
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:02,260
piece that's computationally intensive
 

3185
01:06:02,260 --> 01:06:04,470
piece that's computationally intensive
it's not lots of lines of code but there

3186
01:06:04,470 --> 01:06:04,480
it's not lots of lines of code but there
 

3187
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:06,450
it's not lots of lines of code but there
it takes a lot of cycles to run that

3188
01:06:06,450 --> 01:06:06,460
it takes a lot of cycles to run that
 

3189
01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:08,280
it takes a lot of cycles to run that
code that that's going to be the

3190
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:08,290
code that that's going to be the
 

3191
01:06:08,290 --> 01:06:10,200
code that that's going to be the
accelerator piece and so this that's

3192
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:10,210
accelerator piece and so this that's
 

3193
01:06:10,210 --> 01:06:12,710
accelerator piece and so this that's
what makes this from a computer

3194
01:06:12,710 --> 01:06:12,720
what makes this from a computer
 

3195

3198
01:06:17,490 --> 01:06:17,500
interesting decade but Hennessy and I
 

3199
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:18,440
interesting decade but Hennessy and I
talked about

3200
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:18,450
talked about
 

3201
01:06:18,450 --> 01:06:19,819
talked about
that the title of our Turing warrant

01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:26,660
this as a very exciting decade much like
 

3207
01:06:26,660 --> 01:06:29,000
this as a very exciting decade much like
when we were assistant professors and

very exciting time was where we were
 

3213
01:06:32,490 --> 01:06:34,040
very exciting time was where we were

stuff with the TPU sort of there's a

3232
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:54,089
stuff with the TPU sort of there's a
 

3233
01:06:54,089 --> 01:06:56,089
stuff with the TPU sort of there's a
closer to the hardware that could be

3234
01:06:56,089 --> 01:06:56,099
closer to the hardware that could be
 

3235
01:06:56,099 --> 01:06:59,630
closer to the hardware that could be
optimizations around the IROC closer to

mean if you think about the old risks

3246
01:07:09,290 --> 01:07:09,300
mean if you think about the old risks

mean if you think about the old risks
this debate it was both

3248
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:11,250
this debate it was both
 

3249
01:07:11,250 --> 01:07:13,430
this debate it was both
it was software hardware it was the

3250
01:07:13,430 --> 01:07:13,440
it was software hardware it was the
 

3251
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:16,660
it was software hardware it was the
compilers improving as well as the

compilers improving as well as the
 

3253
01:07:16,670 --> 01:07:18,710
compilers improving as well as the
architecture improving and that that's

3254
01:07:18,710 --> 01:07:18,720
architecture improving and that that's
 

3255
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:21,859
architecture improving and that that's
likely to be the way things are now

01:07:27,260 --> 01:07:27,270
domain-specific languages the languages
 

3261
01:07:27,270 --> 01:07:30,950
domain-specific languages the languages
like tensorflow and pi torch are very

01:07:30,950 --> 01:07:30,960
like tensorflow and pi torch are very
 

3263
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:32,569
like tensorflow and pi torch are very
popular with the machine learning people

3264
01:07:32,569 --> 01:07:32,579
popular with the machine learning people
 

3265
01:07:32,579 --> 01:07:34,880
popular with the machine learning people
that those are the raising the level of

that those are the raising the level of
abstraction it's easier for people to

3268
01:07:36,530 --> 01:07:36,540
abstraction it's easier for people to
 

3269
01:07:36,540 --> 01:07:38,109
abstraction it's easier for people to
write machine learning in these

3270
01:07:38,109 --> 01:07:38,119
write machine learning in these
 

3271
01:07:38,119 --> 01:07:41,690
write machine learning in these
domain-specific languages like like a PI

so where the most of the optimization

3276
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:45,690
so where the most of the optimization
 

3277
01:07:45,690 --> 01:07:47,870
so where the most of the optimization
but yeah and so that and so there'll be

3278
01:07:47,870 --> 01:07:47,880
but yeah and so that and so there'll be
 

3279
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:50,359
but yeah and so that and so there'll be
both the compiler piece and the hardware

3280
01:07:50,359 --> 01:07:50,369
both the compiler piece and the hardware
 

3281
01:07:50,369 --> 01:07:52,849
both the compiler piece and the hardware
piece underneath it so as you kind of

3282
01:07:52,849 --> 01:07:52,859
piece underneath it so as you kind of
 

3283
01:07:52,859 --> 01:07:54,920
piece underneath it so as you kind of
the fatal flaw for hardware people is to

3284

you know what we thought it was you know
we I was involved in the start you know

we I was involved in the start you know
 

3393

we I was involved in the start you know
we that Peter Matson is leading the

we that Peter Matson is leading the
 

3395

we that Peter Matson is leading the
effort from Google Google got it off the

effort from Google Google got it off the
 

3397
01:10:00,659 --> 01:10:02,149
effort from Google Google got it off the
ground but we had to reach out to

ground but we had to reach out to
 

3399
01:10:02,159 --> 01:10:05,660
ground but we had to reach out to
competitors and say there's no

3400
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:05,670
competitors and say there's no

this is bad for the field it'll be much
 

3405
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:10,459
this is bad for the field it'll be much
better if we look at examples like in

01:10:10,459 --> 01:10:10,469
better if we look at examples like in

01:10:10,469 --> 01:10:12,319
better if we look at examples like in
the wrist days there was an effort to

01:10:12,329 --> 01:10:15,049
the wrist days there was an effort to
create a for the the people in the risk

01:10:17,219 --> 01:10:18,529
community got together competitors got
together a building risk microprocessors

3414
01:10:18,529 --> 01:10:18,539
together a building risk microprocessors
 

3415
01:10:18,539 --> 01:10:20,569
together a building risk microprocessors
to agree on a set of benchmarks that we

3416
01:10:20,569 --> 01:10:20,579
to agree on a set of benchmarks that we
 

3417
01:10:20,579 --> 01:10:22,729
to agree on a set of benchmarks that we
called spec and that was good for the

3418
01:10:22,729 --> 01:10:22,739
called spec and that was good for the
 

3419
01:10:22,739 --> 01:10:25,430
called spec and that was good for the
industry is rather before the different

risk architectures were arguing well you

3422
01:10:27,049 --> 01:10:27,059
risk architectures were arguing well you
 

3423
01:10:27,059 --> 01:10:28,490
risk architectures were arguing well you
can believe my performance others but

3424
01:10:28,490 --> 01:10:28,500
can believe my performance others but
 

3425
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:31,220
can believe my performance others but
those other guys are liars and that

3426
01:10:31,220 --> 01:10:31,230
those other guys are liars and that
 

3427
01:10:31,230 --> 01:10:33,379
those other guys are liars and that
didn't do any good so we agreed on a set

3428
01:10:33,379 --> 01:10:33,389
didn't do any good so we agreed on a set
 

3429
01:10:33,389 --> 01:10:35,270
didn't do any good so we agreed on a set
of benchmarks and then we could figure

3430
01:10:35,270 --> 01:10:35,280
of benchmarks and then we could figure
 

3431
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:37,220
of benchmarks and then we could figure
out who is faster between the various

3432
01:10:37,220 --> 01:10:37,230
out who is faster between the various
 

3433
01:10:37,230 --> 01:10:38,540
out who is faster between the various
risk architectures but it was a little

3434
01:10:38,540 --> 01:10:38,550
risk architectures but it was a little
 

3435
01:10:38,550 --> 01:10:41,149
risk architectures but it was a little
bit faster but that drew the market

3436
01:10:41,149 --> 01:10:41,159
bit faster but that drew the market
 

3437
01:10:41,159 --> 01:10:42,589
bit faster but that drew the market
rather than you know people were afraid

3438
01:10:42,589 --> 01:10:42,599
rather than you know people were afraid
 

3439
01:10:42,599 --> 01:10:44,120
rather than you know people were afraid
to buy anything so we argued the same

3440
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:44,130

we all got together to create a set of

3450
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:53,510
we all got together to create a set of
 

3451
01:10:53,510 --> 01:10:55,930
we all got together to create a set of
benchmarks and do the right thing right

3452
01:10:55,930 --> 01:10:55,940
benchmarks and do the right thing right
 

3453
01:10:55,940 --> 01:10:59,080
benchmarks and do the right thing right
and we agree on the results and so we

and we agree on the results and so we
 

3455
01:10:59,090 --> 01:11:03,520
and we agree on the results and so we
can see whether TP use or GPUs or CPUs

3456
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:03,530
can see whether TP use or GPUs or CPUs
 

3457
01:11:03,530 --> 01:11:04,840
can see whether TP use or GPUs or CPUs
are really faster than how much the

01:11:04,850 --> 01:11:06,550
are really faster than how much the
faster and I think from an engineer's

01:11:06,550 --> 01:11:06,560
faster and I think from an engineer's
 

3461
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:09,310
faster and I think from an engineer's
perspective as long as the results are

that's been happening in terms of
starting off engineers it's just in the

starting off engineers it's just in the
 

3565
01:13:10,889 --> 01:13:12,790

back when he did his dissertation
figured out a way to do benchmarks he

3664
01:15:11,419 --> 01:15:11,429
figured out a way to do benchmarks he
 

3665

01:15:18,239 --> 01:15:20,209
to see which algorithms run well and
that was as far as I know kind of the

3672
01:15:20,209 --> 01:15:20,219
that was as far as I know kind of the
 

3673
01:15:20,219 --> 01:15:23,600
that was as far as I know kind of the
first time people did benchmarks in

all you know the things that eventually

3678
01:15:27,830 --> 01:15:27,840
all you know the things that eventually

01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:29,540
all you know the things that eventually
led to imagenet himself like that but

3680
01:15:29,540 --> 01:15:29,550
led to imagenet himself like that but
 

3681
01:15:29,550 --> 01:15:31,310
led to imagenet himself like that but
then you know the vision community got

3682
01:15:31,310 --> 01:15:31,320
then you know the vision community got
 

3683
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:33,200
then you know the vision community got
religion and then once we got as far as

01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:42,350
Toronto be able to win the image net
competition and then you know that

3690
01:15:42,350 --> 01:15:42,360
competition and then you know that
 

3691
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:44,330
competition and then you know that
changed the whole world it's a scary

3692
01:15:44,330 --> 01:15:44,340
changed the whole world it's a scary

01:15:47,390 --> 01:15:47,400
step actually because when you enter the
 

3695
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:48,770

yeah you can just you just believe

3700
01:15:54,470 --> 01:15:54,480
yeah you can just you just believe
 

3701
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:57,620
yeah you can just you just believe
you're the best in the world and I think

3702
01:15:57,620 --> 01:15:57,630
you're the best in the world and I think
 

3703
01:15:57,630 --> 01:15:59,479
you're the best in the world and I think
the people I think they weren't

3704
01:15:59,479 --> 01:15:59,489
the people I think they weren't
 

3705
01:15:59,489 --> 01:16:02,060
the people I think they weren't
purposely misleading I think if you

3706
01:16:02,060 --> 01:16:02,070
purposely misleading I think if you
 

3707
01:16:02,070 --> 01:16:03,500
purposely misleading I think if you
don't have benchmarks I mean how do you

3708
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:03,510
don't have benchmarks I mean how do you
 

3709
01:16:03,510 --> 01:16:05,660
don't have benchmarks I mean how do you
know you know you could have your

3710
01:16:05,660 --> 01:16:05,670
know you know you could have your
 

3711
01:16:05,670 --> 01:16:07,220
know you know you could have your
intuition it's kind of like the way we

3712
01:16:07,220 --> 01:16:07,230
intuition it's kind of like the way we
 

3713
01:16:07,230 --> 01:16:08,360
intuition it's kind of like the way we
did used to do computer architecture

3714
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:08,370
did used to do computer architecture
 

3715
01:16:08,370 --> 01:16:10,490
did used to do computer architecture
your intuition is that this is the right

3716
01:16:10,490 --> 01:16:10,500
your intuition is that this is the right
 

3717
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:12,680
your intuition is that this is the right
instruction set to do this job I believe

3718
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:12,690
instruction set to do this job I believe
 

3719
01:16:12,690 --> 01:16:16,060
instruction set to do this job I believe
in my experience my hunch is that's true

3720
01:16:16,060 --> 01:16:16,070
in my experience my hunch is that's true
 

3721
01:16:16,070 --> 01:16:18,530
in my experience my hunch is that's true
we had to get to make things more

3722
01:16:18,530 --> 01:16:18,540
we had to get to make things more
 

3723
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:21,770
we had to get to make things more
quantitative to make progress and so I

3724
01:16:21,770 --> 01:16:21,780
quantitative to make progress and so I
 

3725
01:16:21,780 --> 01:16:24,649
quantitative to make progress and so I
just don't know how you know in fields

3726
01:16:24,649 --> 01:16:24,659
just don't know how you know in fields
 

3727
01:16:24,659 --> 01:16:26,030
just don't know how you know in fields
that don't have benchmarks I don't

3728
01:16:26,030 --> 01:16:26,040
that don't have benchmarks I don't
 

3729
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:27,709
that don't have benchmarks I don't
understand how they figure out how

3730
01:16:27,709 --> 01:16:27,719
understand how they figure out how
 

3731
01:16:27,719 --> 01:16:31,160
understand how they figure out how
they're making progress we're kind of in

3732
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:31,170
they're making progress we're kind of in
 

3733
01:16:31,170 --> 01:16:33,439
they're making progress we're kind of in

have to start teaching this I'd say

3748
01:16:51,110 --> 01:16:51,120
have to start teaching this I'd say
 

3749
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:53,120
have to start teaching this I'd say

quantum computing is a something that

3802
01:17:52,399 --> 01:17:52,409
quantum computing is a something that
 

3803
01:17:52,409 --> 01:17:55,970
quantum computing is a something that
could happen and when it does happen you

3804
01:17:55,970 --> 01:17:55,980
could happen and when it does happen you
 

3805
01:17:55,980 --> 01:17:57,500
could happen and when it does happen you
know this is going to be big science

3806
01:17:57,500 --> 01:17:57,510
know this is going to be big science
 

3807
01:17:57,510 --> 01:18:00,140
know this is going to be big science
stuff this is you know microkelvin

right so this will be in data center

3814
01:18:07,790 --> 01:18:07,800
right so this will be in data center
 

3815
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:09,169
right so this will be in data center
stuff we're not gonna have a quantum

3819
01:18:12,929 --> 01:18:15,169

kind of thing so I'm happy that other

3820
01:18:15,169 --> 01:18:15,179
kind of thing so I'm happy that other
 

3821
01:18:15,179 --> 01:18:17,060
kind of thing so I'm happy that other
people are working on it but just you

3822
01:18:17,060 --> 01:18:17,070
people are working on it but just you
 

3823
01:18:17,070 --> 01:18:19,129
people are working on it but just you
know it's hard with all the news about

3824
01:18:19,129 --> 01:18:19,139
know it's hard with all the news about
 

3825
01:18:19,139 --> 01:18:20,899
know it's hard with all the news about
it not to think that it's right around

01:18:20,899 --> 01:18:20,909
it not to think that it's right around
 

3827
01:18:20,909 --> 01:18:24,080
it not to think that it's right around
the corner and that's why we need to do

3828
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:24,090
the corner and that's why we need to do
 

3829
01:18:24,090 --> 01:18:25,939
the corner and that's why we need to do
something as Moore's Law is slowing down

3830
01:18:25,939 --> 01:18:25,949
something as Moore's Law is slowing down
 

3831
01:18:25,949 --> 01:18:29,060
something as Moore's Law is slowing down
to provide the computing keep improving

getting better for this next decade and
 

3835
01:18:30,809 --> 01:18:33,200
getting better for this next decade and
and you know we shouldn't be betting on

great if quantum computing is gonna

3846
01:18:45,229 --> 01:18:45,239
great if quantum computing is gonna

general-purpose computation so it's
 

3853
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:53,689
general-purpose computation so it's
gonna do some amazing things but

such a fast-moving field I just don't
know how to I'm

so maybe if it's possible to untangle
 

3901
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:44,930
so maybe if it's possible to untangle
your intuition a little bit

01:19:44,940 --> 01:19:46,910
your intuition a little bit
I spoke with Jim Keller I don't know if

3904
01:19:46,910 --> 01:19:46,920
I spoke with Jim Keller I don't know if
 

3905
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:50,120
I spoke with Jim Keller I don't know if
you're familiar with Jim and he he is

3906
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:50,130
you're familiar with Jim and he he is
 

3907
01:19:50,130 --> 01:19:52,250
you're familiar with Jim and he he is
trying to sort of be a little bit

3908
01:19:52,250 --> 01:19:52,260
trying to sort of be a little bit
 

3909
01:19:52,260 --> 01:19:54,560
trying to sort of be a little bit
rebellious and to try to think that he

3910
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:54,570
rebellious and to try to think that he
 

3911
01:19:54,570 --> 01:19:58,820
rebellious and to try to think that he
quotes me as being wrong yeah so what

3912
01:19:58,820 --> 01:19:58,830
quotes me as being wrong yeah so what
 

3913
01:19:58,830 --> 01:20:01,750
quotes me as being wrong yeah so what
are your the relationship for the record

3914
01:20:01,750 --> 01:20:01,760
are your the relationship for the record
 

3915
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:05,150
are your the relationship for the record
Jim talks about that he has an intuition

3916
01:20:05,150 --> 01:20:05,160
Jim talks about that he has an intuition
 

3917
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:07,520
Jim talks about that he has an intuition
that Moore's law is not in fact in fact

3918
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:07,530
that Moore's law is not in fact in fact
 

3919
01:20:07,530 --> 01:20:10,040
that Moore's law is not in fact in fact
dead yet and then it may continue for

3920
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:10,050
dead yet and then it may continue for
 

3921
01:20:10,050 --> 01:20:11,210
dead yet and then it may continue for
some time to come

3922
01:20:11,210 --> 01:20:11,220
some time to come
 

3923
01:20:11,220 --> 01:20:13,910
some time to come
what are your thoughts about Jim's ideas

3924
01:20:13,910 --> 01:20:13,920
what are your thoughts about Jim's ideas
 

3925
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:16,220
what are your thoughts about Jim's ideas
in this space yeah this is just this is

3926
01:20:16,220 --> 01:20:16,230
in this space yeah this is just this is
 

3927
01:20:16,230 --> 01:20:19,190
in this space yeah this is just this is
just marketing so but Gordon Moore said

3928
01:20:19,190 --> 01:20:19,200
just marketing so but Gordon Moore said
 

3929
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:22,370
just marketing so but Gordon Moore said
is a quantitative prediction if we can

3930
01:20:22,370 --> 01:20:22,380
is a quantitative prediction if we can
 

3931
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:24,380
is a quantitative prediction if we can
check the facts right which is doubling

3932
01:20:24,380 --> 01:20:24,390
check the facts right which is doubling
 

3933
01:20:24,390 --> 01:20:26,900
check the facts right which is doubling
the number of transistors every two

3934
01:20:26,900 --> 01:20:26,910
the number of transistors every two
 

3935
01:20:26,910 --> 01:20:29,720
the number of transistors every two
years so we can look back at Intel for

3936
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:29,730
years so we can look back at Intel for
 

3937
01:20:29,730 --> 01:20:32,090
years so we can look back at Intel for
the last five years and ask him let's

3938
01:20:32,090 --> 01:20:32,100
the last five years and ask him let's
 

3939
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:37,010
the last five years and ask him let's
look at DRAM chips six years ago so that

3940
01:20:37,010 --> 01:20:37,020
look at DRAM chips six years ago so that
 

3941
01:20:37,020 --> 01:20:40,490
look at DRAM chips six years ago so that
would be three two-year periods so then

3942
01:20:40,490 --> 01:20:40,500
would be three two-year periods so then
 

3943
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:43,280
would be three two-year periods so then
our DRAM chips have eight times as many

3944
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:43,290
our DRAM chips have eight times as many
 

3945
01:20:43,290 --> 01:20:46,130
our DRAM chips have eight times as many
transistors as they did six years ago we

3946
01:20:46,130 --> 01:20:46,140
transistors as they did six years ago we
 

3947
01:20:46,140 --> 01:20:48,710
transistors as they did six years ago we
can look up Intel microprocessors six

3948
01:20:48,710 --> 01:20:48,720
can look up Intel microprocessors six
 

3949
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:49,160
can look up Intel microprocessors six
years ago

3950
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:49,170
years ago
 

3951
01:20:49,170 --> 01:20:51,830
years ago
if Moore's law is continuing it should

3952
01:20:51,830 --> 01:20:51,840
if Moore's law is continuing it should
 

3953
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:54,680
if Moore's law is continuing it should
have eight times as many transistors as

3954
01:20:54,680 --> 01:20:54,690
have eight times as many transistors as
 

3955
01:20:54,690 --> 01:20:57,680
have eight times as many transistors as
six years ago the answers in both those

3956
01:20:57,680 --> 01:20:57,690
six years ago the answers in both those
 

3957
01:20:57,690 --> 01:21:02,330
six years ago the answers in both those
cases is no the problem has been because

3958
01:21:02,330 --> 01:21:02,340
cases is no the problem has been because
 

3959
01:21:02,340 --> 01:21:05,480
cases is no the problem has been because
Moore's law was kind of genuinely

3960
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:05,490
Moore's law was kind of genuinely
 

3961
01:21:05,490 --> 01:21:07,700
Moore's law was kind of genuinely
embraced by the semiconductor industries

3962
01:21:07,700 --> 01:21:07,710
embraced by the semiconductor industries
 

3963
01:21:07,710 --> 01:21:09,980
embraced by the semiconductor industries
they would make investments in severe

3964
01:21:09,980 --> 01:21:09,990
they would make investments in severe
 

3965
01:21:09,990 --> 01:21:13,480
they would make investments in severe
equipment to make Moore's Law come true

3966
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:13,490
equipment to make Moore's Law come true
 

3967
01:21:13,490 --> 01:21:16,370
equipment to make Moore's Law come true
semiconductor improving in Moore's law

3968
01:21:16,370 --> 01:21:16,380
semiconductor improving in Moore's law
 

3969
01:21:16,380 --> 01:21:18,920
semiconductor improving in Moore's law
in many people's mind are the same thing

3970
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:18,930
in many people's mind are the same thing
 

3971
01:21:18,930 --> 01:21:22,240
in many people's mind are the same thing
so when I say and I'm factually correct

3972
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:22,250
so when I say and I'm factually correct
 

3973
01:21:22,250 --> 01:21:26,510
so when I say and I'm factually correct
that Moore's law is no longer holds we

3974
01:21:26,510 --> 01:21:26,520
that Moore's law is no longer holds we
 

3975
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:28,010
that Moore's law is no longer holds we
are not doubling transistors every years

3976
01:21:28,010 --> 01:21:28,020
are not doubling transistors every years
 

3977
01:21:28,020 --> 01:21:31,100
are not doubling transistors every years
years the downside for a company like

3978
01:21:31,100 --> 01:21:31,110
years the downside for a company like
 

3979
01:21:31,110 --> 01:21:34,460
years the downside for a company like
Intel is people think that means it

3980
01:21:34,460 --> 01:21:34,470
Intel is people think that means it
 

3981
01:21:34,470 --> 01:21:36,980
Intel is people think that means it
stopped that technology has no longer

improved and so Jim is trying to react

3984
01:21:42,470 --> 01:21:42,480
improved and so Jim is trying to react
 

3985
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:45,430
improved and so Jim is trying to react
at AraC the impression that

3986
01:21:45,430 --> 01:21:45,440
at AraC the impression that
 

3987
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:49,160
at AraC the impression that
semiconductors are frozen in 2000

nineteen are never gonna get better so I

3990
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:51,750
nineteen are never gonna get better so I
 

3991
01:21:51,750 --> 01:21:55,400
nineteen are never gonna get better so I
never said that I said was Moore's law

3992
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:55,410
never said that I said was Moore's law
 

3993
01:21:55,410 --> 01:21:58,100
never said that I said was Moore's law
is no more and I'm strictly looking at a

3994
01:21:58,100 --> 01:21:58,110
is no more and I'm strictly looking at a
 

3995
01:21:58,110 --> 01:21:59,810
is no more and I'm strictly looking at a
number of transistors because that's

3996
01:21:59,810 --> 01:21:59,820
number of transistors because that's
 

3997
01:21:59,820 --> 01:22:01,610
number of transistors because that's
what more that's what Moore's law is

3998
01:22:01,610 --> 01:22:01,620
what more that's what Moore's law is
 

3999
01:22:01,620 --> 01:22:04,460
what more that's what Moore's law is
there's the I don't know there's been

4000
01:22:04,460 --> 01:22:04,470
there's the I don't know there's been
 

4001
01:22:04,470 --> 01:22:07,400
there's the I don't know there's been
this aura associated with Moore's law

4002
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:07,410
this aura associated with Moore's law
 

4003
01:22:07,410 --> 01:22:09,970
this aura associated with Moore's law
that they've enjoyed for fifty years

4004
01:22:09,970 --> 01:22:09,980
that they've enjoyed for fifty years
 

4005
01:22:09,980 --> 01:22:12,500
that they've enjoyed for fifty years
about look at the field we're in we're

4006
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:12,510
about look at the field we're in we're
 

4007
01:22:12,510 --> 01:22:14,180
about look at the field we're in we're
doubling transistors every two years

4008
01:22:14,180 --> 01:22:14,190
doubling transistors every two years
 

4009
01:22:14,190 --> 01:22:15,830
doubling transistors every two years
what an amazing field which is an

4010
01:22:15,830 --> 01:22:15,840
what an amazing field which is an
 

4011
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:17,270
what an amazing field which is an
amazing thing that they were able to

4012
01:22:17,270 --> 01:22:17,280
amazing thing that they were able to
 

4013
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:19,370
amazing thing that they were able to
pull off but even as Gordon Moore said

4014
01:22:19,370 --> 01:22:19,380
pull off but even as Gordon Moore said
 

4015
01:22:19,380 --> 01:22:21,080
pull off but even as Gordon Moore said
you know no exponential can last forever

4016
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:21,090
you know no exponential can last forever
 

4017
01:22:21,090 --> 01:22:23,090
you know no exponential can last forever
it's lasted for 50 years which is

it's lasted for 50 years which is
 

4019
01:22:23,100 --> 01:22:25,880
it's lasted for 50 years which is
amazing and this is a huge impact on the

amazing and this is a huge impact on the
 

4021
01:22:25,890 --> 01:22:27,830
amazing and this is a huge impact on the
industry because of these changes that

you know Patterson says Moore's laws

4028
01:22:35,540 --> 01:22:35,550
you know Patterson says Moore's laws
 

4029
01:22:35,550 --> 01:22:37,460
you know Patterson says Moore's laws
know more and look at all look at it

01:22:37,460 --> 01:22:37,470
know more and look at all look at it
 

4031
01:22:37,470 --> 01:22:40,580
know more and look at all look at it
it's still controlling and tsmc to say

4032
01:22:40,580 --> 01:22:40,590
it's still controlling and tsmc to say
 

4033
01:22:40,590 --> 01:22:43,220
it's still controlling and tsmc to say
it's as no longer but there but there's

4034
01:22:43,220 --> 01:22:43,230
it's as no longer but there but there's
 

4035
01:22:43,230 --> 01:22:44,540
it's as no longer but there but there's
quantitative evidence that Moore's law

4036
01:22:44,540 --> 01:22:44,550
quantitative evidence that Moore's law
 

4037
01:22:44,550 --> 01:22:46,940
quantitative evidence that Moore's law
is not continuing so what I say now to

4038
01:22:46,940 --> 01:22:46,950
is not continuing so what I say now to
 

4039
01:22:46,950 --> 01:22:50,360
is not continuing so what I say now to
try and okay I understand the perception

4040
01:22:50,360 --> 01:22:50,370
try and okay I understand the perception
 

4041
01:22:50,370 --> 01:22:52,160
try and okay I understand the perception
problem when I say Moore's law is

4042
01:22:52,160 --> 01:22:52,170
problem when I say Moore's law is
 

4043
01:22:52,170 --> 01:22:55,160
problem when I say Moore's law is
stopped okay so now I say Moore's law

4044
01:22:55,160 --> 01:22:55,170
stopped okay so now I say Moore's law
 

4045
01:22:55,170 --> 01:22:58,580
stopped okay so now I say Moore's law
slowing down and I think Jim which is

4046
01:22:58,580 --> 01:22:58,590
slowing down and I think Jim which is
 

4047
01:22:58,590 --> 01:23:01,220
slowing down and I think Jim which is
another way if he's if it's predicting

4048
01:23:01,220 --> 01:23:01,230
another way if he's if it's predicting
 

4049
01:23:01,230 --> 01:23:02,510
another way if he's if it's predicting
every two years and I say it's slowing

4050
01:23:02,510 --> 01:23:02,520
every two years and I say it's slowing
 

4051
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:04,550
every two years and I say it's slowing
down then that's another way of saying

4052
01:23:04,550 --> 01:23:04,560
down then that's another way of saying
 

4053
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:06,650
down then that's another way of saying
it doesn't hold anymore and and I think

4054
01:23:06,650 --> 01:23:06,660
it doesn't hold anymore and and I think
 

4055
01:23:06,660 --> 01:23:09,890
it doesn't hold anymore and and I think
Jim wouldn't disagree that it's slowing

4056
01:23:09,890 --> 01:23:09,900
Jim wouldn't disagree that it's slowing
 

4057
01:23:09,900 --> 01:23:11,930
Jim wouldn't disagree that it's slowing
down because that sounds like it's

4058
01:23:11,930 --> 01:23:11,940
down because that sounds like it's
 

4059
01:23:11,940 --> 01:23:13,970
down because that sounds like it's
things are still getting better just not

4060
01:23:13,970 --> 01:23:13,980
things are still getting better just not
 

4061
01:23:13,980 --> 01:23:16,340
things are still getting better just not
as fast which is another way of saying

4062
01:23:16,340 --> 01:23:16,350
as fast which is another way of saying
 

4063
01:23:16,350 --> 01:23:18,140
as fast which is another way of saying
Moore's law isn't working anymore

4064
01:23:18,140 --> 01:23:18,150
Moore's law isn't working anymore

it's still good for marketing but uh but

4066
01:23:21,410 --> 01:23:21,420
it's still good for marketing but uh but
 

4067
01:23:21,420 --> 01:23:23,330
it's still good for marketing but uh but
what's your you're not you don't like

4068
01:23:23,330 --> 01:23:23,340
what's your you're not you don't like
 

4069
01:23:23,340 --> 01:23:25,280
what's your you're not you don't like
expanding the definition of Moore's law

4070
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:25,290
expanding the definition of Moore's law
 

4071
01:23:25,290 --> 01:23:27,860
expanding the definition of Moore's law
sort of uh well yeah that's really yeah

4072
01:23:27,860 --> 01:23:27,870
sort of uh well yeah that's really yeah
 

4073
01:23:27,870 --> 01:23:30,650
sort of uh well yeah that's really yeah
it's an educator you know are you know

01:24:10,850 --> 01:24:10,860
but they reinterpreted it because they
 

4109
01:24:10,860 --> 01:24:13,520
but they reinterpreted it because they
believed that the that the cost of

people industry have told me that's not
 

4117
01:24:20,580 --> 01:24:22,780
people industry have told me that's not

01:24:35,959 --> 01:24:35,969
certainly you know Moore's law that was
 

4129
01:24:35,969 --> 01:24:37,700
certainly you know Moore's law that was
the beauty of Moore's law it was a very

the beauty of Moore's law it was a very
 

4131
01:24:37,710 --> 01:24:40,100
the beauty of Moore's law it was a very
simple it's like equals mc-squared right

the implications are amazing and that's
 

4139
01:24:46,860 --> 01:24:48,919
the implications are amazing and that's
why it was so famous as a as a

Moore's law they're not saying by the
 

4153
01:25:04,469 --> 01:25:07,310
Moore's law they're not saying by the
way it's instead of every two years it's

4154
01:25:07,310 --> 01:25:07,320
way it's instead of every two years it's
 

4155
01:25:07,320 --> 01:25:09,770
way it's instead of every two years it's
every three years I don't think the I

4156
01:25:09,770 --> 01:25:09,780
every three years I don't think the I
 

4157
01:25:09,780 --> 01:25:11,090
every three years I don't think the I
don't think they want to say that I

4158
01:25:11,090 --> 01:25:11,100
don't think they want to say that I
 

4159
01:25:11,100 --> 01:25:12,709
don't think they want to say that I
think what's going to happen is the new

4160
01:25:12,709 --> 01:25:12,719
think what's going to happen is the new
 

4161
01:25:12,719 --> 01:25:14,450
think what's going to happen is the new
technology Commission's H ones get a

4162
01:25:14,450 --> 01:25:14,460
technology Commission's H ones get a
 

4163
01:25:14,460 --> 01:25:17,629
technology Commission's H ones get a
little bit slower so it it is slowing

4164
01:25:17,629 --> 01:25:17,639
little bit slower so it it is slowing
 

4165
01:25:17,639 --> 01:25:20,510
little bit slower so it it is slowing
down the improvements will won't be as

4166
01:25:20,510 --> 01:25:20,520
down the improvements will won't be as
 

4167
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:22,490
down the improvements will won't be as
great and that's why we need to do new

4168
01:25:22,490 --> 01:25:22,500
great and that's why we need to do new
 

4169
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:25,250
great and that's why we need to do new
things yeah I don't like that the the

4170
01:25:25,250 --> 01:25:25,260
things yeah I don't like that the the
 

4171
01:25:25,260 --> 01:25:26,629
things yeah I don't like that the the

01:25:29,870 --> 01:25:29,880
marketing I it would be nice if it's
 

4175
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:33,169
marketing I it would be nice if it's
whether it's marketing or it's it's well

it could be affecting business but they
 

4179
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:36,649
it could be affecting business but they
could also be infecting the imagination

4180
01:25:36,649 --> 01:25:36,659
could also be infecting the imagination

01:25:45,050 --> 01:25:45,060
2019 well that's that would be bad for
 

4187
01:25:45,060 --> 01:25:47,899
2019 well that's that would be bad for
Intel they not just Intel but everybody

if the Intel if you're using cloud stuff
and servers that you get next year are

4212
01:26:20,420 --> 01:26:20,430
and servers that you get next year are
 

4213
01:26:20,430 --> 01:26:22,280
and servers that you get next year are
basically only a little bit faster than

basically only a little bit faster than
 

4215
01:26:22,290 --> 01:26:24,440
basically only a little bit faster than
the servers you got this year you need

01:26:24,440 --> 01:26:24,450
the servers you got this year you need
 

4217
01:26:24,450 --> 01:26:25,820
the servers you got this year you need
to know that and we need to start

4218
01:26:25,820 --> 01:26:25,830
to know that and we need to start
 

4219
01:26:25,830 --> 01:26:29,900
to know that and we need to start
innovating to start delivery blow on it

4220
01:26:29,900 --> 01:26:29,910
innovating to start delivery blow on it
 

4221
01:26:29,910 --> 01:26:31,790
innovating to start delivery blow on it
if you're counting on your software your

4222
01:26:31,790 --> 01:26:31,800
if you're counting on your software your
 

4223
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:32,570
if you're counting on your software your
software going to add a lot more

4224
01:26:32,570 --> 01:26:32,580
software going to add a lot more
 

4225
01:26:32,580 --> 01:26:34,460
software going to add a lot more
features assuming the computers can get

4226
01:26:34,460 --> 01:26:34,470
features assuming the computers can get
 

4227
01:26:34,470 --> 01:26:36,350
features assuming the computers can get
faster that's not true so are you gonna

4228
01:26:36,350 --> 01:26:36,360
faster that's not true so are you gonna
 

4229
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:38,000
faster that's not true so are you gonna
have to start making your software stack

4230
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:38,010
have to start making your software stack
 

4231
01:26:38,010 --> 01:26:39,530
have to start making your software stack
more efficient or are you gonna have to

4232
01:26:39,530 --> 01:26:39,540
more efficient or are you gonna have to
 

4233
01:26:39,540 --> 01:26:41,270
more efficient or are you gonna have to
start learning about machine learning so

4234
01:26:41,270 --> 01:26:41,280
start learning about machine learning so
 

4235
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:44,420
start learning about machine learning so
it's you know it's kind of a it's a

4236
01:26:44,420 --> 01:26:44,430
it's you know it's kind of a it's a
 

4237
01:26:44,430 --> 01:26:46,640
it's you know it's kind of a it's a
morning or call for arms that the world

4238
01:26:46,640 --> 01:26:46,650
morning or call for arms that the world
 

4239
01:26:46,650 --> 01:26:48,620
morning or call for arms that the world
is changing right now and a lot of

4240
01:26:48,620 --> 01:26:48,630
is changing right now and a lot of
 

4241
01:26:48,630 --> 01:26:50,480
is changing right now and a lot of
people a lot of computer science PhDs

4242
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:50,490
people a lot of computer science PhDs
 

4243
01:26:50,490 --> 01:26:53,540
people a lot of computer science PhDs
are unaware of that so a way to try and

4244
01:26:53,540 --> 01:26:53,550
are unaware of that so a way to try and
 

4245
01:26:53,550 --> 01:26:55,400
are unaware of that so a way to try and
get their attention is to say that

4246
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:55,410
get their attention is to say that
 

4247
01:26:55,410 --> 01:26:57,050
get their attention is to say that
Moore's law is slowing down and that's

4248
01:26:57,050 --> 01:26:57,060
Moore's law is slowing down and that's
 

4249
01:26:57,060 --> 01:27:00,260
Moore's law is slowing down and that's
gonna affect your assumptions and you

4250
01:27:00,260 --> 01:27:00,270
gonna affect your assumptions and you
 

4251
01:27:00,270 --> 01:27:01,340
gonna affect your assumptions and you
know we're trying to get the word out

4252
01:27:01,340 --> 01:27:01,350
know we're trying to get the word out
 

4253
01:27:01,350 --> 01:27:04,130
know we're trying to get the word out
and when companies like TSMC and Intel

4254
01:27:04,130 --> 01:27:04,140
and when companies like TSMC and Intel
 

4255
01:27:04,140 --> 01:27:06,710
and when companies like TSMC and Intel
say oh no no no Moore's law is fine then

4256
01:27:06,710 --> 01:27:06,720
say oh no no no Moore's law is fine then
 

4257
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:08,360
say oh no no no Moore's law is fine then
people think okay that I don't have to

4258
01:27:08,360 --> 01:27:08,370
people think okay that I don't have to
 

4259
01:27:08,370 --> 01:27:10,520
people think okay that I don't have to
change my behavior I'll just get the

4260
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:10,530
change my behavior I'll just get the
 

4261
01:27:10,530 --> 01:27:12,860
change my behavior I'll just get the
next servers and you know if they start

4262
01:27:12,860 --> 01:27:12,870
next servers and you know if they start
 

4263
01:27:12,870 --> 01:27:14,570
next servers and you know if they start
doing measurements though realize what's

4264
01:27:14,570 --> 01:27:14,580
doing measurements though realize what's
 

4265
01:27:14,580 --> 01:27:16,100
doing measurements though realize what's
going on it'd be nice to have some

4266
01:27:16,100 --> 01:27:16,110
going on it'd be nice to have some
 

4267
01:27:16,110 --> 01:27:18,590
going on it'd be nice to have some
transparency and metrics for for the

4268
01:27:18,590 --> 01:27:18,600
transparency and metrics for for the
 

4269
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:19,810
transparency and metrics for for the
layperson

to be able to know if computers are

4272
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:22,410
to be able to know if computers are
 

4273
01:27:22,410 --> 01:27:25,100
to be able to know if computers are
getting faster and there are yeah there

4274
01:27:25,100 --> 01:27:25,110
getting faster and there are yeah there
 

4275
01:27:25,110 --> 01:27:26,990
getting faster and there are yeah there
are there are a bunch of most people

4276
01:27:26,990 --> 01:27:27,000
are there are a bunch of most people
 

4277
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:30,980
are there are a bunch of most people
kind of use clock rate as a measure

4278
01:27:30,980 --> 01:27:30,990
kind of use clock rate as a measure
 

4279
01:27:30,990 --> 01:27:32,600
kind of use clock rate as a measure
performance you know it's not a perfect

4280
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:32,610
performance you know it's not a perfect
 

4281
01:27:32,610 --> 01:27:35,000
performance you know it's not a perfect
one but if you've noticed clock rates

4282
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:35,010
one but if you've noticed clock rates
 

4283
01:27:35,010 --> 01:27:36,530
one but if you've noticed clock rates
are more or less the same as they were

4284
01:27:36,530 --> 01:27:36,540
are more or less the same as they were
 

4285
01:27:36,540 --> 01:27:39,440

five years ago computers are a little

4286
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:39,450
five years ago computers are a little
 

4287
01:27:39,450 --> 01:27:42,320
five years ago computers are a little
better than they aren't they haven't

01:27:43,460 --> 01:27:43,470
made zero progress but they've made
 

4291
01:27:43,470 --> 01:27:45,680
made zero progress but they've made
small progress so you there's some

4292
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:45,690
small progress so you there's some
 

4293
01:27:45,690 --> 01:27:46,790
small progress so you there's some
indications out there and in our

the new ones announced the cameras are
 

4307
01:28:03,210 --> 01:28:03,920
the new ones announced the cameras are
better but that's kind of

4308
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:03,930
better but that's kind of
 

4309
01:28:03,930 --> 01:28:05,510
better but that's kind of
domain-specific right they're putting

01:29:19,540 --> 01:29:19,550
everything was done with floppy disks
 

4363
01:29:19,550 --> 01:29:25,460
everything was done with floppy disks
which are old technologies that to could

4364
01:29:25,460 --> 01:29:25,470
which are old technologies that to could
 

4365
01:29:25,470 --> 01:29:26,420
which are old technologies that to could
store things that didn't have much

4366
01:29:26,420 --> 01:29:26,430
store things that didn't have much
 

4367
01:29:26,430 --> 01:29:29,510
store things that didn't have much
capacity and you had to to get any work

4368
01:29:29,510 --> 01:29:29,520
capacity and you had to to get any work
 

4369
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:30,710
capacity and you had to to get any work
done you're always sticking in your

4370
01:29:30,710 --> 01:29:30,720
done you're always sticking in your
 

4371
01:29:30,720 --> 01:29:32,540
done you're always sticking in your
little floppy disk in and out because

4372
01:29:32,540 --> 01:29:32,550
little floppy disk in and out because
 

4373
01:29:32,550 --> 01:29:34,130
little floppy disk in and out because
they didn't have much capacity but they

4374
01:29:34,130 --> 01:29:34,140
they didn't have much capacity but they
 

4375
01:29:34,140 --> 01:29:36,290
they didn't have much capacity but they
started building what are called hard

4376
01:29:36,290 --> 01:29:36,300
started building what are called hard
 

4377
01:29:36,300 --> 01:29:39,320
started building what are called hard
disk drives which is magnetic material

4378
01:29:39,320 --> 01:29:39,330
disk drives which is magnetic material
 

4379
01:29:39,330 --> 01:29:41,890
disk drives which is magnetic material
that can remember information storage

4380
01:29:41,890 --> 01:29:41,900
that can remember information storage
 

4381
01:29:41,900 --> 01:29:45,320
that can remember information storage
for the Mac and Randy asked the question

4382
01:29:45,320 --> 01:29:45,330
for the Mac and Randy asked the question
 

4383
01:29:45,330 --> 01:29:50,060
for the Mac and Randy asked the question
when he saw this disk next to his Mac

4384
01:29:50,060 --> 01:29:50,070
when he saw this disk next to his Mac
 

4385
01:29:50,070 --> 01:29:51,830
when he saw this disk next to his Mac
jeez he's a brand-new small things

4386
01:29:51,830 --> 01:29:51,840
jeez he's a brand-new small things
 

4387
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:54,350
jeez he's a brand-new small things
before that for the big computers that

4388
01:29:54,350 --> 01:29:54,360
before that for the big computers that
 

4389
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:57,170
before that for the big computers that
the disk would be the size of washing

4390
01:29:57,170 --> 01:29:57,180
the disk would be the size of washing
 

4391
01:29:57,180 --> 01:29:59,090
the disk would be the size of washing
machines and here's something the size

4392
01:29:59,090 --> 01:29:59,100
machines and here's something the size
 

4393
01:29:59,100 --> 01:30:01,580
machines and here's something the size
of a kind of the size of a book or so

4394
01:30:01,580 --> 01:30:01,590
of a kind of the size of a book or so
 

4395
01:30:01,590 --> 01:30:03,410
of a kind of the size of a book or so
this is I wonder what we could do with

4396
01:30:03,410 --> 01:30:03,420
this is I wonder what we could do with
 

4397
01:30:03,420 --> 01:30:07,340
this is I wonder what we could do with
that well we the Randy was involved in

4398
01:30:07,340 --> 01:30:07,350
that well we the Randy was involved in
 

4399
01:30:07,350 --> 01:30:10,220
that well we the Randy was involved in
the in the fourth generation risk

4400
01:30:10,220 --> 01:30:10,230
the in the fourth generation risk
 

4401
01:30:10,230 --> 01:30:11,960
the in the fourth generation risk
project here at Berkeley 80s so we

4402
01:30:11,960 --> 01:30:11,970
project here at Berkeley 80s so we
 

4403
01:30:11,970 --> 01:30:13,640
project here at Berkeley 80s so we
figured out a way how to make the

4404
01:30:13,640 --> 01:30:13,650
figured out a way how to make the
 

4405
01:30:13,650 --> 01:30:15,620
figured out a way how to make the
computation part the processor part go a

4406
01:30:15,620 --> 01:30:15,630
computation part the processor part go a
 

4407
01:30:15,630 --> 01:30:17,750
computation part the processor part go a
lot faster but what about the storage

4408
01:30:17,750 --> 01:30:17,760
lot faster but what about the storage
 

4409
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:20,300
lot faster but what about the storage
part can we do something to make it

4410
01:30:20,300 --> 01:30:20,310
part can we do something to make it
 

4411
01:30:20,310 --> 01:30:24,050
part can we do something to make it
faster so we hit upon the idea of taking

4412
01:30:24,050 --> 01:30:24,060
faster so we hit upon the idea of taking
 

4413
01:30:24,060 --> 01:30:25,850
faster so we hit upon the idea of taking
a lot of these disks developed for

4414
01:30:25,850 --> 01:30:25,860
a lot of these disks developed for
 

4415
01:30:25,860 --> 01:30:27,470
a lot of these disks developed for
personal computers and mackintoshes and

4416
01:30:27,470 --> 01:30:27,480
personal computers and mackintoshes and
 

4417
01:30:27,480 --> 01:30:29,690
personal computers and mackintoshes and
putting many of them together instead of

4418
01:30:29,690 --> 01:30:29,700
putting many of them together instead of
 

4419
01:30:29,700 --> 01:30:31,160
putting many of them together instead of
one of these washing machine sized

4420
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:31,170
one of these washing machine sized
 

4421
01:30:31,170 --> 01:30:33,770
one of these washing machine sized
things and so we were to rub the first

4422
01:30:33,770 --> 01:30:33,780
things and so we were to rub the first
 

4423
01:30:33,780 --> 01:30:35,570
things and so we were to rub the first
draft of the paper and we'd have 40 of

4424
01:30:35,570 --> 01:30:35,580
draft of the paper and we'd have 40 of
 

4425
01:30:35,580 --> 01:30:36,890
draft of the paper and we'd have 40 of
these little PC DOS

4426
01:30:36,890 --> 01:30:36,900
these little PC DOS
 

4427
01:30:36,900 --> 01:30:39,830
these little PC DOS
instead of one of these washing machine

4428
01:30:39,830 --> 01:30:39,840
instead of one of these washing machine
 

4429
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:41,419
instead of one of these washing machine
size things and they would be much

4430
01:30:41,419 --> 01:30:41,429
size things and they would be much
 

4431
01:30:41,429 --> 01:30:43,490
size things and they would be much
cheaper because they're made for PCs and

4432
01:30:43,490 --> 01:30:43,500
cheaper because they're made for PCs and
 

4433
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:45,380
cheaper because they're made for PCs and
they could actually kind of be faster

4434
01:30:45,380 --> 01:30:45,390
they could actually kind of be faster
 

4435
01:30:45,390 --> 01:30:46,790
they could actually kind of be faster
because there was 40 of them rather than

4436
01:30:46,790 --> 01:30:46,800
because there was 40 of them rather than
 

4437
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:49,130
because there was 40 of them rather than
one of them and so he wrote a paper like

4438
01:30:49,130 --> 01:30:49,140
one of them and so he wrote a paper like
 

4439
01:30:49,140 --> 01:30:50,990
one of them and so he wrote a paper like
that and send it to one of a former

4440
01:30:50,990 --> 01:30:51,000
that and send it to one of a former
 

4441
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,760
that and send it to one of a former
Berkeley students at IBM and he said

4442
01:30:52,760 --> 01:30:52,770
Berkeley students at IBM and he said
 

4443
01:30:52,770 --> 01:30:54,080
Berkeley students at IBM and he said
well this is all great and good but what

4444
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:54,090
well this is all great and good but what
 

4445
01:30:54,090 --> 01:30:55,729
well this is all great and good but what
about the reliability of these things

4446
01:30:55,729 --> 01:30:55,739
about the reliability of these things
 

4447
01:30:55,739 --> 01:30:59,330
about the reliability of these things
now you have 40 of these devices each of

4448
01:30:59,330 --> 01:30:59,340
now you have 40 of these devices each of
 

4449
01:30:59,340 --> 01:31:01,490
now you have 40 of these devices each of
which are kind of PC quality so they're

4450
01:31:01,490 --> 01:31:01,500
which are kind of PC quality so they're
 

4451
01:31:01,500 --> 01:31:03,590
which are kind of PC quality so they're
not as good as these IBM washing

4452
01:31:03,590 --> 01:31:03,600
not as good as these IBM washing
 

4453
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:06,370
not as good as these IBM washing
machines IBM dominated the the the

4454
01:31:06,370 --> 01:31:06,380
machines IBM dominated the the the
 

4455
01:31:06,380 --> 01:31:08,840
machines IBM dominated the the the
storage Genesis so you

4456
01:31:08,840 --> 01:31:08,850
storage Genesis so you
 

4457
01:31:08,850 --> 01:31:11,209
storage Genesis so you
reliably gonna be awful and so when we

4458
01:31:11,209 --> 01:31:11,219
reliably gonna be awful and so when we
 

4459
01:31:11,219 --> 01:31:13,669
reliably gonna be awful and so when we
calculated it out instead of you know it

4460
01:31:13,669 --> 01:31:13,679
calculated it out instead of you know it
 

4461
01:31:13,679 --> 01:31:15,740
calculated it out instead of you know it
breaking on average once a year it would

4462
01:31:15,740 --> 01:31:15,750
breaking on average once a year it would
 

4463
01:31:15,750 --> 01:31:18,590
breaking on average once a year it would
break every two weeks so we thought

4464
01:31:18,590 --> 01:31:18,600
break every two weeks so we thought
 

4465
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:21,410
break every two weeks so we thought
about the idea and said well we got to

4466
01:31:21,410 --> 01:31:21,420
about the idea and said well we got to
 

4467
01:31:21,420 --> 01:31:23,240
about the idea and said well we got to
address the reliability so we did it

4468
01:31:23,240 --> 01:31:23,250
address the reliability so we did it
 

4469
01:31:23,250 --> 01:31:24,979
address the reliability so we did it
originally performance but we had do

4470
01:31:24,979 --> 01:31:24,989
originally performance but we had do
 

4471
01:31:24,989 --> 01:31:27,890
originally performance but we had do
reliability so the name redundant array

4472
01:31:27,890 --> 01:31:27,900
reliability so the name redundant array
 

4473
01:31:27,900 --> 01:31:30,320
reliability so the name redundant array
of inexpensive disks is array of these

4474
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:30,330
of inexpensive disks is array of these
 

4475
01:31:30,330 --> 01:31:33,229
of inexpensive disks is array of these
disks inexpensive life for pcs but we

4476
01:31:33,229 --> 01:31:33,239
disks inexpensive life for pcs but we
 

4477
01:31:33,239 --> 01:31:36,979
disks inexpensive life for pcs but we
have extra copies so if one breaks we

4478
01:31:36,979 --> 01:31:36,989
have extra copies so if one breaks we
 

4479
01:31:36,989 --> 01:31:38,810
have extra copies so if one breaks we
won't lose all the information will have

4480
01:31:38,810 --> 01:31:38,820
won't lose all the information will have
 

4481
01:31:38,820 --> 01:31:41,270
won't lose all the information will have
enough redundancy that we could let some

4482
01:31:41,270 --> 01:31:41,280
enough redundancy that we could let some
 

4483
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:42,680
enough redundancy that we could let some
break and we can still preserve the

4484
01:31:42,680 --> 01:31:42,690
break and we can still preserve the
 

4485
01:31:42,690 --> 01:31:44,689
break and we can still preserve the
information so the name is an array of

4486
01:31:44,689 --> 01:31:44,699
information so the name is an array of
 

4487
01:31:44,699 --> 01:31:47,209
information so the name is an array of
inexpensive discs this is a collection

4488
01:31:47,209 --> 01:31:47,219
inexpensive discs this is a collection
 

4489
01:31:47,219 --> 01:31:49,340
inexpensive discs this is a collection
of these pcs and the are part of the

4490
01:31:49,340 --> 01:31:49,350
of these pcs and the are part of the
 

4491
01:31:49,350 --> 01:31:51,709
of these pcs and the are part of the
name was the redundancy so they'd be

4492
01:31:51,709 --> 01:31:51,719
name was the redundancy so they'd be
 

4493
01:31:51,719 --> 01:31:53,570
name was the redundancy so they'd be
reliable and it turns out if you put a

4494
01:31:53,570 --> 01:31:53,580
reliable and it turns out if you put a
 

4495
01:31:53,580 --> 01:31:55,880
reliable and it turns out if you put a
modest number of extra disks in one of

4496
01:31:55,880 --> 01:31:55,890
modest number of extra disks in one of
 

4497
01:31:55,890 --> 01:31:57,860
modest number of extra disks in one of
these arrays it could actually not only

4498
01:31:57,860 --> 01:31:57,870
these arrays it could actually not only
 

4499
01:31:57,870 --> 01:32:00,410
these arrays it could actually not only
be as faster and cheaper that one of

4500
01:32:00,410 --> 01:32:00,420
be as faster and cheaper that one of
 

4501
01:32:00,420 --> 01:32:01,820
be as faster and cheaper that one of
these washing machine discs it could be

4502
01:32:01,820 --> 01:32:01,830
these washing machine discs it could be
 

4503
01:32:01,830 --> 01:32:04,220
these washing machine discs it could be
actually more reliable because you could

4504
01:32:04,220 --> 01:32:04,230
actually more reliable because you could
 

4505
01:32:04,230 --> 01:32:05,689
actually more reliable because you could
have a couple of breaks even with these

4506
01:32:05,689 --> 01:32:05,699
have a couple of breaks even with these
 

4507
01:32:05,699 --> 01:32:08,120
have a couple of breaks even with these
cheap discs whereas one failure with the

4508
01:32:08,120 --> 01:32:08,130
cheap discs whereas one failure with the
 

4509
01:32:08,130 --> 01:32:09,770
cheap discs whereas one failure with the
washing machine thing would knock it out

4510
01:32:09,770 --> 01:32:09,780
washing machine thing would knock it out
 

4511
01:32:09,780 --> 01:32:11,990
washing machine thing would knock it out
did you did you have a sense just like

01:32:11,990 --> 01:32:12,000
did you did you have a sense just like
 

4513
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:16,250
did you did you have a sense just like
with risk that in the 30 years that

4514
01:32:16,250 --> 01:32:16,260

4515
01:32:16,260 --> 01:32:20,060

naturally an optimist but I thought our

4520
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:29,370
naturally an optimist but I thought our
 

4521
01:32:29,370 --> 01:32:30,410
naturally an optimist but I thought our
ideas were right

4522
01:32:30,410 --> 01:32:30,420
ideas were right
 

4523
01:32:30,420 --> 01:32:32,990

I thought kind of like Moore's law it

4524
01:32:32,990 --> 01:32:33,000
I thought kind of like Moore's law it
 

4525
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:34,610
I thought kind of like Moore's law it
seemed to me if you looked at the

4526
01:32:34,610 --> 01:32:34,620
seemed to me if you looked at the
 

4527
01:32:34,620 --> 01:32:35,810
seemed to me if you looked at the
history of the disk drives

4528
01:32:35,810 --> 01:32:35,820
history of the disk drives
 

4529
01:32:35,820 --> 01:32:37,610
history of the disk drives
they went from washing machine size

4530
01:32:37,610 --> 01:32:37,620
they went from washing machine size
 

4531
01:32:37,620 --> 01:32:38,930
they went from washing machine size
things than they were getting smaller

4532
01:32:38,930 --> 01:32:38,940
things than they were getting smaller
 

4533
01:32:38,940 --> 01:32:41,689
things than they were getting smaller
and smaller and the volumes were with

4534
01:32:41,689 --> 01:32:41,699
and smaller and the volumes were with
 

4535
01:32:41,699 --> 01:32:43,669
and smaller and the volumes were with
the smaller disk drives because that's

4536
01:32:43,669 --> 01:32:43,679
the smaller disk drives because that's
 

4537
01:32:43,679 --> 01:32:46,070
the smaller disk drives because that's
where the PCs were so we thought that

4538
01:32:46,070 --> 01:32:46,080
where the PCs were so we thought that
 

4539
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:49,040
where the PCs were so we thought that
was a technological trend that disk

4540
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:49,050
was a technological trend that disk
 

4541
01:32:49,050 --> 01:32:49,580
was a technological trend that disk
drives

4543
01:32:49,590 --> 01:32:50,840
drives
the volume

4544
01:32:50,840 --> 01:32:50,850
the volume
 

4545
01:32:50,850 --> 01:32:52,760
the volume
disk drives was going to be small

4546
01:32:52,760 --> 01:32:52,770
disk drives was going to be small
 

4547
01:32:52,770 --> 01:32:53,840
disk drives was going to be small
getting smaller and smaller devices

4548
01:32:53,840 --> 01:32:53,850
getting smaller and smaller devices
 

4549
01:32:53,850 --> 01:32:55,910
getting smaller and smaller devices
which were true they were the size of

4550
01:32:55,910 --> 01:32:55,920
which were true they were the size of
 

4551
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:58,160
which were true they were the size of
the I don't know eight inches diameter

4552
01:32:58,160 --> 01:32:58,170
the I don't know eight inches diameter
 

4553
01:32:58,170 --> 01:33:00,290
the I don't know eight inches diameter
than five inches than three inches of

4554
01:33:00,290 --> 01:33:00,300
than five inches than three inches of
 

4555
01:33:00,300 --> 01:33:03,500
than five inches than three inches of
diameters and so that it made sense to

4556
01:33:03,500 --> 01:33:03,510
diameters and so that it made sense to
 

4557
01:33:03,510 --> 01:33:05,210
diameters and so that it made sense to
figure out how to deal things with an

4558
01:33:05,210 --> 01:33:05,220
figure out how to deal things with an
 

4559
01:33:05,220 --> 01:33:07,100
figure out how to deal things with an
array of disks so I think it was one of

4560
01:33:07,100 --> 01:33:07,110
array of disks so I think it was one of
 

4561
01:33:07,110 --> 01:33:09,560
array of disks so I think it was one of
those things where logically we think

4562
01:33:09,560 --> 01:33:09,570
those things where logically we think
 

4563
01:33:09,570 --> 01:33:12,230
those things where logically we think
the technological forces were on our

4564
01:33:12,230 --> 01:33:12,240
the technological forces were on our
 

4565
01:33:12,240 --> 01:33:15,890
the technological forces were on our
side that it made sense so we expected

4566
01:33:15,890 --> 01:33:15,900
side that it made sense so we expected
 

4567
01:33:15,900 --> 01:33:17,960
side that it made sense so we expected
it to catch on but there was that same

4568
01:33:17,960 --> 01:33:17,970
it to catch on but there was that same
 

4569
01:33:17,970 --> 01:33:20,150
it to catch on but there was that same
kind of business question you know IBM

4570
01:33:20,150 --> 01:33:20,160
kind of business question you know IBM
 

4571
01:33:20,160 --> 01:33:22,370
kind of business question you know IBM
was the big pusher of these disk drives

4572
01:33:22,370 --> 01:33:22,380
was the big pusher of these disk drives
 

4573
01:33:22,380 --> 01:33:25,400
was the big pusher of these disk drives
in the real world where the technical

4574
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:25,410
in the real world where the technical
 

4575
01:33:25,410 --> 01:33:26,840
in the real world where the technical
advantage get turned into a business

4576

sound technically and it was unclear
 

4583
01:33:35,100 --> 01:33:37,280
sound technically and it was unclear
worth of the business side but we kind

4584
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:37,290
worth of the business side but we kind
 

4585
01:33:37,290 --> 01:33:38,930
worth of the business side but we kind
of as academics we believe the

4586
01:33:38,930 --> 01:33:38,940
of as academics we believe the
 

4587
01:33:38,940 --> 01:33:42,350

technology should win and and it did and
 

4589
01:33:42,360 --> 01:33:44,020

and if you look at those thirty years

4590
01:33:44,020 --> 01:33:44,030
and if you look at those thirty years
 

4591
01:33:44,030 --> 01:33:46,160
and if you look at those thirty years
just from your perspective are there

interesting developments in the space of
storage that have happened in that time

4596
01:33:50,180 --> 01:33:50,190
storage that have happened in that time
 

4597
01:33:50,190 --> 01:33:53,090
storage that have happened in that time
yeah the big thing that happened both a

4598
01:33:53,090 --> 01:33:53,100
yeah the big thing that happened both a
 

4599
01:33:53,100 --> 01:33:54,860
yeah the big thing that happened both a
couple of things that happened what we

4600
01:33:54,860 --> 01:33:54,870
couple of things that happened what we
 

4601
01:33:54,870 --> 01:33:57,670
couple of things that happened what we
did had a modest amount of storage so as

4602
01:33:57,670 --> 01:33:57,680
did had a modest amount of storage so as
 

4603
01:33:57,680 --> 01:34:00,920
did had a modest amount of storage so as
redundancy as people built bigger and

4604
01:34:00,920 --> 01:34:00,930
redundancy as people built bigger and
 

4605
01:34:00,930 --> 01:34:03,380
redundancy as people built bigger and
bigger storage systems they've added

4606
01:34:03,380 --> 01:34:03,390
bigger storage systems they've added
 

4607
01:34:03,390 --> 01:34:04,820
bigger storage systems they've added
more we doesn't see so they could have

4608
01:34:04,820 --> 01:34:04,830
more we doesn't see so they could have
 

4609
01:34:04,830 --> 01:34:06,530
more we doesn't see so they could have
more failures and they have biggest

4610
01:34:06,530 --> 01:34:06,540
more failures and they have biggest
 

4611
01:34:06,540 --> 01:34:08,990
more failures and they have biggest
thing that happened in storage is for

4612
01:34:08,990 --> 01:34:09,000
thing that happened in storage is for
 

4613
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:12,200
thing that happened in storage is for
decades it was based on things

4614
01:34:12,200 --> 01:34:12,210
decades it was based on things
 

4615
01:34:12,210 --> 01:34:15,170
decades it was based on things
physically spinning called hard disk

01:34:16,700 --> 01:34:16,710
drives where you used to turn on your
 

4619
01:34:16,710 --> 01:34:18,680
drives where you used to turn on your
computer and it would make a noise what

4620
01:34:18,680 --> 01:34:18,690
computer and it would make a noise what
 

4621
01:34:18,690 --> 01:34:20,750
computer and it would make a noise what
that noise was was the disk drive

4622
01:34:20,750 --> 01:34:20,760
that noise was was the disk drive
 

4623
01:34:20,760 --> 01:34:22,820
that noise was was the disk drive
spinning and they were rotating it in

4624
01:34:22,820 --> 01:34:22,830
spinning and they were rotating it in
 

4625
01:34:22,830 --> 01:34:26,000
spinning and they were rotating it in
like 60 revolutions per second and it's

4626
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:26,010
like 60 revolutions per second and it's
 

4627
01:34:26,010 --> 01:34:29,440
like 60 revolutions per second and it's
like if you remember the vinyl vinyl

4628
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:29,450
like if you remember the vinyl vinyl
 

4629
01:34:29,450 --> 01:34:31,940
like if you remember the vinyl vinyl
records if you've ever seen those that's

4630
01:34:31,940 --> 01:34:31,950
records if you've ever seen those that's
 

4631
01:34:31,950 --> 01:34:33,560
records if you've ever seen those that's
what it looked like and there was like a

4632
01:34:33,560 --> 01:34:33,570
what it looked like and there was like a
 

4633
01:34:33,570 --> 01:34:35,420
what it looked like and there was like a
needle like on a vinyl record that was

4634
01:34:35,420 --> 01:34:35,430
needle like on a vinyl record that was
 

4635
01:34:35,430 --> 01:34:37,940
needle like on a vinyl record that was
reading it so the big drive a change is

4636
01:34:37,940 --> 01:34:37,950
reading it so the big drive a change is
 

4637
01:34:37,950 --> 01:34:39,590
reading it so the big drive a change is
switching that over to a similar

individual discs but still the raid

4676
01:35:30,350 --> 01:35:30,360
individual discs but still the raid
 

4677
01:35:30,360 --> 01:35:32,270
individual discs but still the raid
mechanism applies to those different

4678
01:35:32,270 --> 01:35:32,280
mechanism applies to those different
 

4679
01:35:32,280 --> 01:35:34,490
mechanism applies to those different
kinds of yes the the people will still

4680
01:35:34,490 --> 01:35:34,500
kinds of yes the the people will still
 

4681
01:35:34,500 --> 01:35:37,340
kinds of yes the the people will still
use raid ideas because it's kind of

4682
01:35:37,340 --> 01:35:37,350
use raid ideas because it's kind of
 

4683
01:35:37,350 --> 01:35:39,010
use raid ideas because it's kind of
what's different you know kind of

4684
01:35:39,010 --> 01:35:39,020
what's different you know kind of
 

4685
01:35:39,020 --> 01:35:41,359
what's different you know kind of
interesting kind of psychologically if

4686
01:35:41,359 --> 01:35:41,369
interesting kind of psychologically if
 

4687
01:35:41,369 --> 01:35:44,240
interesting kind of psychologically if
you think about it people have always

4688
01:35:44,240 --> 01:35:44,250
you think about it people have always
 

4689
01:35:44,250 --> 01:35:45,320
you think about it people have always
worried about the reliability of

4690
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:45,330
worried about the reliability of
 

4691
01:35:45,330 --> 01:35:47,270
worried about the reliability of
computing since the earliest days so

4692
01:35:47,270 --> 01:35:47,280
computing since the earliest days so
 

4693
01:35:47,280 --> 01:35:49,180
computing since the earliest days so
kind of but if we're talking about

4694
01:35:49,180 --> 01:35:49,190
kind of but if we're talking about
 

4695
01:35:49,190 --> 01:35:52,310
kind of but if we're talking about
computation if your computer makes a

4696
01:35:52,310 --> 01:35:52,320
computation if your computer makes a
 

4697
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:56,090
computation if your computer makes a
mistake and the computer says the

4698
01:35:56,090 --> 01:35:56,100
mistake and the computer says the
 

4699
01:35:56,100 --> 01:35:58,250
mistake and the computer says the
computer has worries to check and say we

4700
01:35:58,250 --> 01:35:58,260
computer has worries to check and say we
 

4701
01:35:58,260 --> 01:36:00,859
computer has worries to check and say we
screwed up we made a mistake what

4702
01:36:00,859 --> 01:36:00,869
screwed up we made a mistake what
 

4703
01:36:00,869 --> 01:36:02,780
screwed up we made a mistake what
happens is that program that was running

4704
01:36:02,780 --> 01:36:02,790
happens is that program that was running
 

4705
01:36:02,790 --> 01:36:04,910
happens is that program that was running
you have to redo it which is a hassle

4706
01:36:04,910 --> 01:36:04,920
you have to redo it which is a hassle
 

4707
01:36:04,920 --> 01:36:09,859
you have to redo it which is a hassle
for storage if you've sent important

4708
01:36:09,859 --> 01:36:09,869
for storage if you've sent important
 

4709
01:36:09,869 --> 01:36:12,410
for storage if you've sent important
information away and it loses that

4710
01:36:12,410 --> 01:36:12,420
information away and it loses that
 

4711
01:36:12,420 --> 01:36:14,870
information away and it loses that
information you go nuts yeah yeah this

4712
01:36:14,870 --> 01:36:14,880
information you go nuts yeah yeah this
 

4713
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:17,240
information you go nuts yeah yeah this
is the worst I oh my god so if you have

4714
01:36:17,240 --> 01:36:17,250
is the worst I oh my god so if you have
 

4715
01:36:17,250 --> 01:36:19,790
is the worst I oh my god so if you have
a laptop and you're not backing it up on

4716
01:36:19,790 --> 01:36:19,800
a laptop and you're not backing it up on
 

4717
01:36:19,800 --> 01:36:21,200
a laptop and you're not backing it up on
the cloud or something like this and

4718
01:36:21,200 --> 01:36:21,210
the cloud or something like this and
 

4719
01:36:21,210 --> 01:36:24,350
the cloud or something like this and
your disk drive breaks which it can do

4720
01:36:24,350 --> 01:36:24,360
your disk drive breaks which it can do
 

4721
01:36:24,360 --> 01:36:26,689
your disk drive breaks which it can do
you'll lose all that information and you

4722
01:36:26,689 --> 01:36:26,699
you'll lose all that information and you
 

4723
01:36:26,699 --> 01:36:28,729
you'll lose all that information and you
just go crazy right so the importance of

4724
01:36:28,729 --> 01:36:28,739
just go crazy right so the importance of
 

4725
01:36:28,739 --> 01:36:31,399
just go crazy right so the importance of
reliability for storage is tremendously

4726
01:36:31,399 --> 01:36:31,409
reliability for storage is tremendously
 

4727
01:36:31,409 --> 01:36:32,720
reliability for storage is tremendously
higher than the importance of

4728
01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:32,730
higher than the importance of
 

4729
01:36:32,730 --> 01:36:34,790
higher than the importance of
reliability for computation because of

4730
01:36:34,790 --> 01:36:34,800
reliability for computation because of
 

4731
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:37,129
reliability for computation because of
the consequences of it so yes so raid

4732
01:36:37,129 --> 01:36:37,139
the consequences of it so yes so raid
 

4733
01:36:37,139 --> 01:36:39,590
the consequences of it so yes so raid
ideas are still very popular even with

4734
01:36:39,590 --> 01:36:39,600
ideas are still very popular even with
 

4735
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:41,270
ideas are still very popular even with
the switch of the technology although

4736
01:36:41,270 --> 01:36:41,280
the switch of the technology although
 

4737
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:43,479
the switch of the technology although
you know flash drives are more reliable

4738
01:36:43,479 --> 01:36:43,489
you know flash drives are more reliable
 

4739
01:36:43,489 --> 01:36:45,470
you know flash drives are more reliable
you know if you're not doing anything

4740
01:36:45,470 --> 01:36:45,480
you know if you're not doing anything
 

4741
01:36:45,480 --> 01:36:47,689
you know if you're not doing anything
like backing it up to get some

4742
01:36:47,689 --> 01:36:47,699
like backing it up to get some
 

4743
01:36:47,699 --> 01:36:49,250
like backing it up to get some
redundancy so they handle it you're

4744
01:36:49,250 --> 01:36:49,260
redundancy so they handle it you're
 

4745
01:36:49,260 --> 01:36:53,959
redundancy so they handle it you're
you're you're taking great risks you

4746
01:36:53,959 --> 01:36:53,969
you're you're taking great risks you
 

4747
01:36:53,969 --> 01:36:56,000
you're you're taking great risks you
said that for you and possibly from any

4748
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:56,010
said that for you and possibly from any

others teaching and research don't

4750
01:36:58,240 --> 01:36:58,250
others teaching and research don't
 

4751
01:36:58,250 --> 01:37:00,649
others teaching and research don't
conflict with each other as right one

4752
01:37:00,649 --> 01:37:00,659
conflict with each other as right one
 

4753
01:37:00,659 --> 01:37:02,359
conflict with each other as right one
might suspect and in fact they kind of

4754
01:37:02,359 --> 01:37:02,369
might suspect and in fact they kind of
 

4755
01:37:02,369 --> 01:37:04,609
might suspect and in fact they kind of
complement each other so maybe a

4756
01:37:04,609 --> 01:37:04,619
complement each other so maybe a
 

4757
01:37:04,619 --> 01:37:06,680
complement each other so maybe a
question I have is how is teaching

4758
01:37:06,680 --> 01:37:06,690
question I have is how is teaching
 

4759
01:37:06,690 --> 01:37:08,750
question I have is how is teaching
helped you in your research or just in

4760
01:37:08,750 --> 01:37:08,760
helped you in your research or just in
 

4761
01:37:08,760 --> 01:37:10,370

entirety as a person who both teaches
 

4765
01:37:13,030 --> 01:37:16,260
entirety as a person who both teaches
and does research and just thinks and

4766
01:37:16,260 --> 01:37:16,270
and does research and just thinks and
 

4767
01:37:16,270 --> 01:37:18,510
and does research and just thinks and
creates new ideas in this world yes I

4768
01:37:18,510 --> 01:37:18,520
creates new ideas in this world yes I
 

4769
01:37:18,520 --> 01:37:20,820
creates new ideas in this world yes I
think I think what happens is is when

4770
01:37:20,820 --> 01:37:20,830
think I think what happens is is when
 

4771
01:37:20,830 --> 01:37:22,590
think I think what happens is is when
you're a college student you know

4772
01:37:22,590 --> 01:37:22,600
you're a college student you know
 

4773
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:24,150
you're a college student you know
there's this kind of tenure system and

4774
01:37:24,150 --> 01:37:24,160
there's this kind of tenure system and
 

4775
01:37:24,160 --> 01:37:26,520
there's this kind of tenure system and
doing research so kind of this model

4776
01:37:26,520 --> 01:37:26,530
doing research so kind of this model
 

4777
01:37:26,530 --> 01:37:30,270
doing research so kind of this model
that you know is popular in America I

4778
01:37:30,270 --> 01:37:30,280
that you know is popular in America I
 

4779
01:37:30,280 --> 01:37:31,830
that you know is popular in America I
think America really made it happen is

4780
01:37:31,830 --> 01:37:31,840
think America really made it happen is
 

4781
01:37:31,840 --> 01:37:33,600

we can attract these really great

4782
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:33,610
we can attract these really great

01:37:33,610 --> 01:37:36,390
we can attract these really great
faculty to research universities because

4784
01:37:36,390 --> 01:37:36,400
faculty to research universities because
 

4785
01:37:36,400 --> 01:37:38,070
faculty to research universities because
they get to do research as well as teach

4786
01:37:38,070 --> 01:37:38,080
they get to do research as well as teach
 

4787
01:37:38,080 --> 01:37:40,020
they get to do research as well as teach
and that especially in fast-moving

4788
01:37:40,020 --> 01:37:40,030
and that especially in fast-moving
 

4789
01:37:40,030 --> 01:37:41,850
and that especially in fast-moving
fields this means people are up-to-date

4790
01:37:41,850 --> 01:37:41,860
fields this means people are up-to-date
 

4791
01:37:41,860 --> 01:37:43,140
fields this means people are up-to-date
and they're teaching those kind of

4792
01:37:43,140 --> 01:37:43,150
and they're teaching those kind of
 

4793
01:37:43,150 --> 01:37:45,390
and they're teaching those kind of
things so but when you run into a really

4794
01:37:45,390 --> 01:37:45,400
things so but when you run into a really
 

4795
01:37:45,400 --> 01:37:47,760
things so but when you run into a really
bad professor a really bad teacher I

4796
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:47,770
bad professor a really bad teacher I
 

4797
01:37:47,770 --> 01:37:49,560
bad professor a really bad teacher I
think the students think well this guy

4798
01:37:49,560 --> 01:37:49,570
think the students think well this guy
 

4799
01:37:49,570 --> 01:37:52,470
think the students think well this guy
must be a great researcher because why

4800
01:37:52,470 --> 01:37:52,480
must be a great researcher because why
 

4801
01:37:52,480 --> 01:37:55,080
must be a great researcher because why
else could he be here so is I you know I

4802
01:37:55,080 --> 01:37:55,090
else could he be here so is I you know I
 

4803

I after 40 years at Berkeley we had a

4804
01:37:57,360 --> 01:37:57,370
I after 40 years at Berkeley we had a
 

4805
01:37:57,370 --> 01:37:58,920
I after 40 years at Berkeley we had a
retirement party and I got a chance to

4806
01:37:58,920 --> 01:37:58,930
retirement party and I got a chance to
 

4807
01:37:58,930 --> 01:38:00,530
retirement party and I got a chance to
reflect and I looked back to some things

4808
01:38:00,530 --> 01:38:00,540
reflect and I looked back to some things
 

4809
01:38:00,540 --> 01:38:04,020
reflect and I looked back to some things
that is not my experience there's a I

4810
01:38:04,020 --> 01:38:04,030
that is not my experience there's a I
 

4811
01:38:04,030 --> 01:38:07,680
that is not my experience there's a I
saw a photograph of five of us in the

already all of us are in the National
 

4831
01:38:27,580 --> 01:38:29,850
already all of us are in the National
Academy of Engineering we've all run the

4832
01:38:29,850 --> 01:38:29,860
Academy of Engineering we've all run the
 

4833
01:38:29,860 --> 01:38:33,180
Academy of Engineering we've all run the
distinguished Teaching Award Blum Karp

4834
01:38:33,180 --> 01:38:33,190
distinguished Teaching Award Blum Karp
 

4835
01:38:33,190 --> 01:38:34,950
distinguished Teaching Award Blum Karp
and I are all have turing award just

4836
01:38:34,950 --> 01:38:34,960
and I are all have turing award just
 

4837
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:37,080
and I are all have turing award just
going away that's right you know the

4838
01:38:37,080 --> 01:38:37,090
going away that's right you know the
 

4839
01:38:37,090 --> 01:38:41,190
going away that's right you know the
highest award in computing so the

4840
01:38:41,190 --> 01:38:41,200
highest award in computing so the
 

4841
01:38:41,200 --> 01:38:44,070
highest award in computing so the
opposite right it's what happens if you

4842
01:38:44,070 --> 01:38:44,080
opposite right it's what happens if you
 

4843
01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:46,140
opposite right it's what happens if you
it's it's they're highly correlated so

4844
01:38:46,140 --> 01:38:46,150
it's it's they're highly correlated so
 

4845
01:38:46,150 --> 01:38:48,300
it's it's they're highly correlated so
probably the other way to think of it if

4846
01:38:48,300 --> 01:38:48,310
probably the other way to think of it if
 

4847
01:38:48,310 --> 01:38:51,180
probably the other way to think of it if
you're very successful people may be

4848
01:38:51,180 --> 01:38:51,190
you're very successful people may be
 

4849
01:38:51,190 --> 01:38:52,920
you're very successful people may be
successful at everything they do it's

4850
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:52,930
successful at everything they do it's
 

4851
01:38:52,930 --> 01:38:55,410
successful at everything they do it's
not an either/or and but it's an

4852
01:38:55,410 --> 01:38:55,420
not an either/or and but it's an
 

4853
01:38:55,420 --> 01:38:56,480
not an either/or and but it's an
interesting question whether

4854
01:38:56,480 --> 01:38:56,490
interesting question whether
 

4855
01:38:56,490 --> 01:38:58,530
interesting question whether
specifically that's probably true but

4856
01:38:58,530 --> 01:38:58,540
specifically that's probably true but
 

4857
01:38:58,540 --> 01:39:00,480
specifically that's probably true but
specifically for teaching if there's

4858
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:00,490
specifically for teaching if there's
 

4859
01:39:00,490 --> 01:39:02,910
specifically for teaching if there's
something in teaching that it's the

4860
01:39:02,910 --> 01:39:02,920
something in teaching that it's the
 

4861
01:39:02,920 --> 01:39:04,830
something in teaching that it's the
Richard Fineman right right yeah is

4862
01:39:04,830 --> 01:39:04,840
Richard Fineman right right yeah is
 

4863
01:39:04,840 --> 01:39:06,360
Richard Fineman right right yeah is
there something about teaching that

4864
01:39:06,360 --> 01:39:06,370
there something about teaching that
 

4865
01:39:06,370 --> 01:39:08,760
there something about teaching that
actually makes your research makes you

4866
01:39:08,760 --> 01:39:08,770
actually makes your research makes you
 

4867
01:39:08,770 --> 01:39:11,040
actually makes your research makes you
think deeper and more outside the box

4868
01:39:11,040 --> 01:39:11,050
think deeper and more outside the box
 

4869
01:39:11,050 --> 01:39:13,440
think deeper and more outside the box
and yeah absolutely so yeah I was going

4870
01:39:13,440 --> 01:39:13,450
and yeah absolutely so yeah I was going
 

4871
01:39:13,450 --> 01:39:15,540
and yeah absolutely so yeah I was going
to bring up Fineman I mean he criticized

4872
01:39:15,540 --> 01:39:15,550
to bring up Fineman I mean he criticized
 

4873
01:39:15,550 --> 01:39:17,040
to bring up Fineman I mean he criticized
the Institute of Advanced Studies

4874
01:39:17,040 --> 01:39:17,050
the Institute of Advanced Studies
 

4875
01:39:17,050 --> 01:39:20,070

would support each other rather than
 

5121
01:44:11,380 --> 01:44:12,690
would support each other rather than
everybody you know in wrestling it's

5122
01:44:12,690 --> 01:44:12,700
everybody you know in wrestling it's
 

5123
01:44:12,700 --> 01:44:14,700
everybody you know in wrestling it's
one-on-one and you could be everybody's

one-on-one and you could be everybody's
 

5125
01:44:14,710 --> 01:44:16,890
one-on-one and you could be everybody's
on their own but he felt if we bonded as

5126
01:44:16,890 --> 01:44:16,900
on their own but he felt if we bonded as
 

5127
01:44:16,900 --> 01:44:19,560
on their own but he felt if we bonded as
a team we'd succeed so I kind of picked

5128
01:44:19,560 --> 01:44:19,570
a team we'd succeed so I kind of picked
 

5129
01:44:19,570 --> 01:44:21,240
a team we'd succeed so I kind of picked
up those skills of how to form

5130
01:44:21,240 --> 01:44:21,250
up those skills of how to form
 

5131
01:44:21,250 --> 01:44:23,820
up those skills of how to form
successful teams and how do you from
