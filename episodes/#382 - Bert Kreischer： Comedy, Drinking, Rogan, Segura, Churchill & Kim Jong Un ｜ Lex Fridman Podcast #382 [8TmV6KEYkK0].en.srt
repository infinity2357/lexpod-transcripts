how this will sound but there was a
 

1625
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,350
how this will sound but there was a
moment that information got leaked about

3309
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:18,049
some coffee and let's see if we can do
like five miles and then know that we

3310
00:59:18,049 --> 00:59:18,059
like five miles and then know that we
 

3311
00:59:18,059 --> 00:59:21,049
like five miles and then know that we
started there and that was really fun

3312
00:59:21,049 --> 00:59:21,059
started there and that was really fun
 

3313
00:59:21,059 --> 00:59:22,970
started there and that was really fun
because like

3314
00:59:22,970 --> 00:59:22,980
because like
 

3315
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:24,470
because like
um cam Haines does that too where he

3316
00:59:24,470 --> 00:59:24,480
um cam Haines does that too where he
 

3317
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:25,549
um cam Haines does that too where he
goes like

3318
00:59:25,549 --> 00:59:25,559
goes like
 

3319
00:59:25,559 --> 00:59:27,710
goes like
he almost just sets the limit and then

3320
00:59:27,710 --> 00:59:27,720
he almost just sets the limit and then
 

3321
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:30,289
he almost just sets the limit and then
and then achieves that his son Truitt is

3322
00:59:30,289 --> 00:59:30,299
and then achieves that his son Truitt is
 

3323
00:59:30,299 --> 00:59:32,270
and then achieves that his son Truitt is
really fascinating because it's untrue

3324
00:59:32,270 --> 00:59:32,280
really fascinating because it's untrue
 

3325
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:33,890
really fascinating because it's untrue
it's right now is trying to get the and

3326
00:59:33,890 --> 00:59:33,900
it's right now is trying to get the and
