always I started trying to think of a
 

131
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,170
always I started trying to think of a
counter example

132
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:20,180

with generalizations of that kind like
always is always a really bold for a

tears but if it's truly novel that means

140
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:28,020
tears but if it's truly novel that means
 

141
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,750
tears but if it's truly novel that means
you don't really understand it's outside

142
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:29,760
you don't really understand it's outside
 

143
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,550
you don't really understand it's outside
your distribution so therefore it's

144
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:31,560
your distribution so therefore it's
 

145
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,750
your distribution so therefore it's
going to have a bunch of uncertainty but

146

going to have a bunch of uncertainty but
 

147
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,369
going to have a bunch of uncertainty but
you don't think of it as uncertainty you

148

you don't think of it as uncertainty you
 

149
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:35,570
you don't think of it as uncertainty you
think about his

151
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,130
think about his
something new

152
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:37,140
something new

like a lot less capable than I am I'm

198
00:03:20,089 --> 00:03:20,099
like a lot less capable than I am I'm

00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:24,410
like really afraid of being perceived as
stupid or something I was also thinking

00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:24,420
stupid or something I was also thinking
 

203
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,670
stupid or something I was also thinking
about this on the way over like I'm kind

204
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:25,680
about this on the way over like I'm kind
 

205
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,110
about this on the way over like I'm kind
of risk-averse in some ways like I don't

206
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:27,120
of risk-averse in some ways like I don't
 

207
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,910
of risk-averse in some ways like I don't
driving fat like driving fast in cars

208
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:28,920
driving fat like driving fast in cars
 

209
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,990
driving fat like driving fast in cars
because I was driving very carefully

210
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:30,000
because I was driving very carefully
 

211
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,850
because I was driving very carefully
here because the roads are bad yeah and

212
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:31,860
here because the roads are bad yeah and
 

213
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,770
here because the roads are bad yeah and
then I think I'm very like pro-risk in

214
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:33,780
then I think I'm very like pro-risk in
 

215
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,229
then I think I'm very like pro-risk in
other ways like being really exposed to

216
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:36,239
other ways like being really exposed to
 

217
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,550
other ways like being really exposed to
like a wide variety of people who might

218
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:37,560
like a wide variety of people who might
 

219
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,009
like a wide variety of people who might
hate you and I think like from the

220
00:03:40,009 --> 00:03:40,019
hate you and I think like from the
 

221
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:41,330
hate you and I think like from the
outside that might look fine but I think

222
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:41,340
outside that might look fine but I think
 

223
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,070
outside that might look fine but I think
the monkey brain is really sensitive to

224
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:43,080
the monkey brain is really sensitive to
 

225
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,809
the monkey brain is really sensitive to
lots of people yelling at you

226
00:03:44,809 --> 00:03:44,819
lots of people yelling at you
 

227
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:47,690
lots of people yelling at you
for whatever problems that you seem to

for whatever problems that you seem to
 

229
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,949
for whatever problems that you seem to
have so that's the big risk you're

00:03:48,949 --> 00:03:48,959
have so that's the big risk you're
 

231
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,309
have so that's the big risk you're
taking is putting yourself out there as

00:03:52,309 --> 00:03:52,319
taking is putting yourself out there as
 

233
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,869
taking is putting yourself out there as
an intellectual like through your

an intellectual like through your
 

235
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:55,850
an intellectual like through your
writing and then a lot of people yelling

236
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:55,860
writing and then a lot of people yelling
 

237
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,289
writing and then a lot of people yelling
at you is that is that the worst

241
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,070
embarrassment it's pretty bad yeah I
think I think the worst embarrassment is

242
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:01,080
think I think the worst embarrassment is
 

243
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,690
think I think the worst embarrassment is
if I put something out there that I

244
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:02,700
if I put something out there that I
 

245
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,309
if I put something out there that I
failed to like be properly skeptical of

in myself
 

249
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:07,729
in myself
and then people are like oh we just

worried about being good scientists yeah
 

263
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:22,250
worried about being good scientists yeah
definitely well you're like methodology

264
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:22,260
definitely well you're like methodology
 

265
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,670
definitely well you're like methodology
yes and funny enough you get attacked on

yes and funny enough you get attacked on
 

267
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,790
yes and funny enough you get attacked on
that methodology even though

00:04:58,969 --> 00:04:58,979
sample size is often gigantic
 

293
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:01,129
sample size is often gigantic
the methodology is right there the data

294
00:05:01,129 --> 00:05:01,139
the methodology is right there the data
 

295
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:03,409
the methodology is right there the data
is right there you provide the data and

criticize it I think this is what peop
 

311
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,390
criticize it I think this is what peop
this is what psychologists are probably

312
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:17,400
this is what psychologists are probably
 

313
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,890
this is what psychologists are probably
terrified about being transparent and

314
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:20,900
terrified about being transparent and
 

315
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,490
terrified about being transparent and
transparent in that way is because

316
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:22,500
transparent in that way is because
 

317
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,749
transparent in that way is because
they'll get attacked for their

they'll get attacked for their
 

319
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,870
they'll get attacked for their
methodology so they want to cloak it in

00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:26,880
methodology so they want to cloak it in
 

321
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,890

from this institution it was peer

326
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:33,000
from this institution it was peer
 

327
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,390
from this institution it was peer
reviewed this kind of all these layers

328
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:35,400
reviewed this kind of all these layers
 

329
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,490
reviewed this kind of all these layers
and I'm also not going to share the data

330
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:37,500
and I'm also not going to share the data
 

331
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,810
and I'm also not going to share the data
with you and I'm also going to pretend

332
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:38,820
with you and I'm also going to pretend
 

333
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,490
with you and I'm also going to pretend
like most psychology studies are not

334
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:40,500
like most psychology studies are not
 

335
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,170
like most psychology studies are not
replicable I'm just going to pretend

336
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:42,180
replicable I'm just going to pretend
 

337
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,150
replicable I'm just going to pretend
there's authority to it I think it works

338
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:44,160
there's authority to it I think it works
 

339
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,469
there's authority to it I think it works
a lot of people like from the outside

340
00:05:45,469 --> 00:05:45,479
a lot of people like from the outside
 

341
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:47,150
a lot of people like from the outside
you're like ah the scientists with the

342
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:47,160
you're like ah the scientists with the
 

343
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,710
you're like ah the scientists with the
white lab coats with credentials those

344
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:48,720
white lab coats with credentials those
 

345
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,610
white lab coats with credentials those
are the people who are like doing

346
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:49,620
are the people who are like doing
 

347
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,070
are the people who are like doing
science and like doing science is you

348
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:52,080
science and like doing science is you
 

349
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,870
science and like doing science is you
know you have like fancy terms that

350
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:53,880
know you have like fancy terms that
 

351
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,270
know you have like fancy terms that
other people are don't really understand

352
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:55,280
other people are don't really understand
 

353
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,070
other people are don't really understand
and to be fair like I I have a lot to

354
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,080
and to be fair like I I have a lot to
 

355
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,810
and to be fair like I I have a lot to
learn I'm still like I'm self-teaching

356
00:05:59,810 --> 00:05:59,820
learn I'm still like I'm self-teaching
 

357
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:00,710
learn I'm still like I'm self-teaching
I'm like learning through people

358
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:00,720
I'm like learning through people
 

359
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,870
I'm like learning through people
learning as I go I'm definitely not

360
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:02,880
learning as I go I'm definitely not
 

361
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,150
learning as I go I'm definitely not
super knowledgeable about this stuff

362
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:05,160
super knowledgeable about this stuff
 

363
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,710
super knowledgeable about this stuff
um but a lot of what those people are

364
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:06,720
um but a lot of what those people are
 

365
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,830
um but a lot of what those people are
doing in science is not that hard

366
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:09,840
doing in science is not that hard
 

367
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,990
doing in science is not that hard
um and a lot of people like don't try to

368
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:12,000
um and a lot of people like don't try to
 

369
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,909
um and a lot of people like don't try to
learn it because it seems so like

370
00:06:13,909 --> 00:06:13,919
learn it because it seems so like
 

371
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,830
learn it because it seems so like
elevated and this is one thing that

372
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:15,840
elevated and this is one thing that
 

373
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,230
elevated and this is one thing that
really bothers me I think like everybody

374
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:18,240
really bothers me I think like everybody
 

375
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,090
really bothers me I think like everybody
can do science like if you just have

376
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:20,100
can do science like if you just have
 

377
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,830
can do science like if you just have
this aspect of curiosity and like you

378
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:21,840
this aspect of curiosity and like you
 

379
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,270
this aspect of curiosity and like you
just really want to figure something out

380
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:23,280
just really want to figure something out
 

381
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,129
just really want to figure something out
you can go and start you know asking

00:06:25,129 --> 00:06:25,139
you can go and start you know asking
 

383
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:26,390
you can go and start you know asking
people questions doing surveys like

384
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:26,400
people questions doing surveys like
 

385
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,490
people questions doing surveys like
writing down the answers and the you go

386
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:28,500
writing down the answers and the you go
 

387
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,170
writing down the answers and the you go
learn how to look at that data in a way

388
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:30,180
learn how to look at that data in a way
 

389
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,790
learn how to look at that data in a way
that gives you more information about

390
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:31,800
that gives you more information about
 

391
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,230
that gives you more information about

00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:37,860
please let's look let's figure this out
 

399
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,710
please let's look let's figure this out
together but people like are think

400
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:39,720
together but people like are think
 

401
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,590
together but people like are think
self-crippled in this because uh they

402
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:42,600

relegated to the domain of the experts
 

407
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,890
relegated to the domain of the experts
and you know the fancy scientists and I

408
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:48,900
and you know the fancy scientists and I
 

409
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,029
and you know the fancy scientists and I
think that makes me feel really sad

410
00:06:50,029 --> 00:06:50,039
think that makes me feel really sad
 

411
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:52,550
think that makes me feel really sad
you're almost attracted to the questions

412
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:52,560
you're almost attracted to the questions
 

413
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,309
you're almost attracted to the questions
you're not supposed to ask oh yeah also

what is some of the most controversial
 

427
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,409
what is some of the most controversial
questions are like around sex it's like

I mean it's it's the driver of human
 

433
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,029
I mean it's it's the driver of human
civilization and yet there's so little

434
00:07:20,029 --> 00:07:20,039
civilization and yet there's so little
 

435
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:22,189
civilization and yet there's so little
like a rigorous discussion about the

436
00:07:22,189 --> 00:07:22,199
like a rigorous discussion about the
 

437
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:23,510
like a rigorous discussion about the
like the philosophical and the

438
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:23,520
like the philosophical and the
 

439
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,370
like the philosophical and the
scientific questions around it it's like

440
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:25,380
scientific questions around it it's like
 

441
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,350
scientific questions around it it's like
it gets really weird

442
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:27,360
it gets really weird
 

443
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,689
it gets really weird
to be able to discuss them it becomes

444
00:07:29,689 --> 00:07:29,699
to be able to discuss them it becomes
 

445
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,909
to be able to discuss them it becomes
tricky to discuss them yeah supercharged

446
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:31,919
tricky to discuss them yeah supercharged
 

447
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,230
tricky to discuss them yeah supercharged
super because everybody has a really

448
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:33,240
super because everybody has a really
 

449
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,850
super because everybody has a really
strong opinion like whether or not you

450
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:34,860
strong opinion like whether or not you
 

451
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,469
strong opinion like whether or not you
know pornography is damaging to society

452

like what kind of sexuality is

456
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:40,020
like what kind of sexuality is
 

457
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,469
like what kind of sexuality is
acceptable like do can you have sexual

458
00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:42,479
acceptable like do can you have sexual
 

459
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,390
acceptable like do can you have sexual
preferences that in them in themselves

460
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:44,400
preferences that in them in themselves
 

461
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,210
preferences that in them in themselves
are immoral uh people get very angry

462
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:47,220
are immoral uh people get very angry
 

463
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,610
are immoral uh people get very angry
about it well the sad part

464
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:49,620
about it well the sad part
 

465
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:52,309
about it well the sad part
is they're not just opinionated but most

466
00:07:52,309 --> 00:07:52,319
is they're not just opinionated but most
 

467
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,730
is they're not just opinionated but most
of us our relationship with sex is a

00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:55,740
of us our relationship with sex is a
 

469
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,710
of us our relationship with sex is a
I think I guess I want to say not

470
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:57,720
I think I guess I want to say not
 

471
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,850
I think I guess I want to say not
rigorous

472
00:07:58,850 --> 00:07:58,860
rigorous
 

473
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,290
rigorous
I think it's very difficult to be

474
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:00,300
I think it's very difficult to be
 

475
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,230
I think it's very difficult to be
rigorous about sex like and I I would

476
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:03,240
rigorous about sex like and I I would
 

477
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,930
rigorous about sex like and I I would
consider uh sexual urges to be kind of

478
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:05,940
consider uh sexual urges to be kind of
 

479
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,730
consider uh sexual urges to be kind of
elusive to introspection in a way that's

480
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:07,740
elusive to introspection in a way that's
 

481
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,050
elusive to introspection in a way that's
a little bit disproportionate to a lot

482
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:09,060
a little bit disproportionate to a lot
 

483
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,670
a little bit disproportionate to a lot
of other things like you could like you

484
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:10,680
of other things like you could like you

of other things like you could like you
know introspect about you know how I

486
00:08:11,689 --> 00:08:11,699
know introspect about you know how I
 

487
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,670
know introspect about you know how I
want other people to like me and

488
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:13,680
want other people to like me and
 

489
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,129
want other people to like me and
um how where my insecurities lie but sex

490
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:16,139
um how where my insecurities lie but sex
 

491
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:18,290
um how where my insecurities lie but sex
is one of those black box things a

492
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:18,300
is one of those black box things a
 

493
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,029
is one of those black box things a
really common thing is for people to if

494
00:08:20,029 --> 00:08:20,039
really common thing is for people to if
 

495
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:21,710
really common thing is for people to if
you have a fetish you sort of check back

496
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:21,720
you have a fetish you sort of check back
 

497
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,050
you have a fetish you sort of check back
in your childhood to see an event that

498
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:24,060
in your childhood to see an event that
 

499
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,309
in your childhood to see an event that
corresponds to that fetish and then you

500
00:08:25,309 --> 00:08:25,319
corresponds to that fetish and then you
 

501
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:26,749
corresponds to that fetish and then you
like develop a narrative like ah this

502
00:08:26,749 --> 00:08:26,759
like develop a narrative like ah this
 

503
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:28,249
like develop a narrative like ah this
event in my childhood must have caused

504
00:08:28,249 --> 00:08:28,259
event in my childhood must have caused
 

505
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:30,050
event in my childhood must have caused
this fetish and so I think this causes

506
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:30,060
this fetish and so I think this causes
 

507
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,670
this fetish and so I think this causes
people to be biased towards like a like

508
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:31,680
people to be biased towards like a like
 

509
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,610
people to be biased towards like a like
a concrete coherent causative way that

510
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:34,620
a concrete coherent causative way that
 

511
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,350
a concrete coherent causative way that
events happen or there's that sexual

512
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:36,360
events happen or there's that sexual
 

513
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,909
events happen or there's that sexual
fetishes happen

514
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:37,919
fetishes happen
 

515
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,230
fetishes happen
um this is just like one example of like

516
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:39,240
um this is just like one example of like
 

517
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,850
um this is just like one example of like
why I think it's really hard to be

518
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:40,860
why I think it's really hard to be
 

519
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,769
why I think it's really hard to be
rigorous with introspection because we

520
00:08:42,769 --> 00:08:42,779
rigorous with introspection because we
 

521
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:44,870
rigorous with introspection because we
can't avoid you just want to tend

522
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:44,880
can't avoid you just want to tend
 

523
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,730
can't avoid you just want to tend
towards making like coherent narratives

524
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:46,740
towards making like coherent narratives
 

525
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,350
towards making like coherent narratives
which I think is not always the correct

526
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:48,360
which I think is not always the correct
 

527
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,269
which I think is not always the correct
way to explain it the narratives that

528
00:08:50,269 --> 00:08:50,279
way to explain it the narratives that
 

529
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,949
way to explain it the narratives that
are connected to Childhood and soil and

530
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:51,959
are connected to Childhood and soil and
 

531
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:54,110
are connected to Childhood and soil and
so on yeah they origin is yeah you've uh

532
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:54,120
so on yeah they origin is yeah you've uh
 

533
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,850
so on yeah they origin is yeah you've uh
I mean we'll talk about fetishes because

534
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:55,860
I mean we'll talk about fetishes because
 

535
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:56,870
I mean we'll talk about fetishes because
you have a lot of really interesting

536

you have a lot of really interesting
 

537
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,269
you have a lot of really interesting
writing on that just actually zooming

538
00:08:59,269 --> 00:08:59,279
writing on that just actually zooming
 

539
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,910
writing on that just actually zooming
out I should mention you tweeted I wrote

540
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:01,920
out I should mention you tweeted I wrote
 

541
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,350
out I should mention you tweeted I wrote
this down you tweeted I do not

542
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:03,360
this down you tweeted I do not
 

543
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,550
this down you tweeted I do not
understand how to have normal

544
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:04,560
understand how to have normal
 

545
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,610
understand how to have normal
conversations with people in person

546
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:07,620
conversations with people in person
 

547
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,829
conversations with people in person
if I'm not on drugs

548
00:09:09,829 --> 00:09:09,839
if I'm not on drugs
 

549
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,449
if I'm not on drugs
so I guess

550
00:09:11,449 --> 00:09:11,459
so I guess
 

551
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:13,430
so I guess
so let's both agree to not have a normal

552
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:13,440
so let's both agree to not have a normal
 

553
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,590
so let's both agree to not have a normal
conversation I guess assuming you're not

554
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:15,600
conversation I guess assuming you're not
 

555
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,449
conversation I guess assuming you're not
on drugs now or if you are Duke you

556
00:09:17,449 --> 00:09:17,459
on drugs now or if you are Duke you
 

557
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:18,829
on drugs now or if you are Duke you
don't have to talk I feel like a very

558
00:09:18,829 --> 00:09:18,839
don't have to talk I feel like a very
 

559
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:20,570
don't have to talk I feel like a very
small amount of fun a bit okay which is

560
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:20,580
small amount of fun a bit okay which is
 

561
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,769
small amount of fun a bit okay which is
a nootropic

562
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:21,779
a nootropic
 

563
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:23,030
a nootropic
I don't know if that counts instead of

564
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:23,040
I don't know if that counts instead of
 

565
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,190
I don't know if that counts instead of
drug well I guess I'm on caffeine yeah

566
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:25,200
drug well I guess I'm on caffeine yeah
 

567
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,509
drug well I guess I'm on caffeine yeah
so we're both

568
00:09:26,509 --> 00:09:26,519
so we're both
 

569
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:28,730
so we're both
drugged up good enough to have a normal

570
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:28,740
drugged up good enough to have a normal
 

571
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,949
drugged up good enough to have a normal
conversation

572
00:09:29,949 --> 00:09:29,959
conversation
 

573
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:32,509
conversation
uh we don't have to

574
00:09:32,509 --> 00:09:32,519
uh we don't have to
 

575
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:35,090
uh we don't have to
what is normal anyway uh what do you

576
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:35,100
what is normal anyway uh what do you
 

577
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,530
what is normal anyway uh what do you
think is the primary driver of human

578
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:36,540
think is the primary driver of human
 

579
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:39,050
think is the primary driver of human
civilization is it the desire for sex

580
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:39,060
civilization is it the desire for sex
 

581
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:43,130
civilization is it the desire for sex
love power or immortality like avoiding

582
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:43,140
love power or immortality like avoiding
 

583
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,930
love power or immortality like avoiding
uh the fear of death constructing

584
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:44,940
uh the fear of death constructing
 

585
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,910
uh the fear of death constructing
illusions that make us forget about our

586
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:46,920
illusions that make us forget about our
 

587
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,870
illusions that make us forget about our
Terror over mortality so sex love power

588
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:50,880
Terror over mortality so sex love power
 

589
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,889
Terror over mortality so sex love power
death is this a Twitter poll it's a poor

590
00:09:54,889 --> 00:09:54,899
death is this a Twitter poll it's a poor
 

591
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:57,949
death is this a Twitter poll it's a poor
option this is reality not everything it

592
00:09:57,949 --> 00:09:57,959
option this is reality not everything it
 

593
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:00,050
option this is reality not everything it
Maps perfectly into a Twitter poll but

594
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:00,060
Maps perfectly into a Twitter poll but
 

595
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,370
Maps perfectly into a Twitter poll but
in this case because there's four

596
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:01,380
in this case because there's four
 

597
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,470
in this case because there's four
options and it is a small number of

598
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:03,480
options and it is a small number of
 

599
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,690
options and it is a small number of
characters it does but I'd like to think

600
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:05,700
characters it does but I'd like to think
 

601
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,269
characters it does but I'd like to think
I'm more interested you know what

602
00:10:08,269 --> 00:10:08,279
I'm more interested you know what
 

603
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:10,250
I'm more interested you know what
I think your Twitter polls are

604
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:10,260
I think your Twitter polls are
 

605
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,750
I think your Twitter polls are
fundamentally interesting there's

606
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:11,760
fundamentally interesting there's
 

607
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,090
fundamentally interesting there's
something about the the brevity of a

608
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:14,100
something about the the brevity of a
 

609
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,850
something about the the brevity of a
poll limiting to a set of choices and

610
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:16,860
poll limiting to a set of choices and
 

611
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,350
poll limiting to a set of choices and
having an existential crisis and

612
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:18,360
having an existential crisis and
 

613
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,850
having an existential crisis and
searching for the answer

614
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:19,860
searching for the answer
 

615
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,430
searching for the answer
that's beautiful that combination well

616
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:22,440
that's beautiful that combination well
 

617
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,690
that's beautiful that combination well
this one's a big one like what do you

618
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:23,700
this one's a big one like what do you
 

619
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,130
this one's a big one like what do you
think is behind it do you believe that

620
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:25,140
think is behind it do you believe that
 

621
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,810
think is behind it do you believe that
there is one primary driver like do you

622
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:26,820
there is one primary driver like do you
 

623
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,130
there is one primary driver like do you
think that it can be understood in the

624
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:28,140
think that it can be understood in the
 

625
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,769
think that it can be understood in the
terms of primary drivers

626
00:10:30,769 --> 00:10:30,779
terms of primary drivers
 

627
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:32,750
terms of primary drivers
yeah I think well maybe it's an

628
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:32,760
yeah I think well maybe it's an
 

629
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,850
yeah I think well maybe it's an
engineering perspective like trying to

630
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:34,860
engineering perspective like trying to
 

631
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,769
engineering perspective like trying to
reverse engineer the brain I don't think

632
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:36,779
reverse engineer the brain I don't think
 

633
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:38,870
reverse engineer the brain I don't think
we're equipped or understanding enough

634
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:38,880
we're equipped or understanding enough
 

635
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,670
we're equipped or understanding enough
about the mind to get there yeah like

636
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:40,680
about the mind to get there yeah like
 

637
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,670
about the mind to get there yeah like
what's the primary driver of a tree

638
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:43,680
what's the primary driver of a tree
 

639
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,650
what's the primary driver of a tree
yeah well then it gets the question of

640
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:45,660
yeah well then it gets the question of
 

641
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,389
yeah well then it gets the question of
what is life what is a living organism

642
00:10:47,389 --> 00:10:47,399
what is life what is a living organism
 

643
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:50,509
what is life what is a living organism

motivated by our trying to escape the
 

851
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,329

00:14:53,329 --> 00:14:53,339
the cold harsh reality that we're going
 

853
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:55,490
the cold harsh reality that we're going
to die and we're terrified of it one of

854
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:55,500
to die and we're terrified of it one of
 

855
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:59,030
to die and we're terrified of it one of
the gifts and burdens

856
00:14:59,030 --> 00:14:59,040
the gifts and burdens
 

857
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,790
the gifts and burdens
for human beings is that we are

858
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:01,800
for human beings is that we are
 

859
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,590
for human beings is that we are
cognizant of our own death

860
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:03,600
cognizant of our own death
 

861
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,870
cognizant of our own death
and that terrifies us that's the theory

862
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:05,880
and that terrifies us that's the theory
 

863
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,449
and that terrifies us that's the theory
and because of that we do everything we

864
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:08,459
and because of that we do everything we
 

865
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:11,810
and because of that we do everything we
can we build we build Empires to escape

866
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:11,820
can we build we build Empires to escape
 

867
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,389
can we build we build Empires to escape
the fact that we're mortal wouldn't this

868
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:14,399
the fact that we're mortal wouldn't this
 

869
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,250

change quite a bit for religious people
 

871
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,870
change quite a bit for religious people
then who don't believe that they're

872
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:17,880
then who don't believe that they're
 

873
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,150
then who don't believe that they're
going to die well they created religion

874
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:20,160
going to die well they created religion
 

875
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,370
going to die well they created religion
the idea there to create myths religions

876
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:22,380
the idea there to create myths religions
 

877
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,769
the idea there to create myths religions
you can create religions of all kinds

878
00:15:24,769 --> 00:15:24,779
you can create religions of all kinds
 

879
00:15:24,779 --> 00:15:27,530
you can create religions of all kinds
like yeah but if this is like one of the

880
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:27,540
like yeah but if this is like one of the
 

881
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,329
like yeah but if this is like one of the
defining things that

882
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:29,339
defining things that
 

883
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:31,310
defining things that
Define civilization then we should

884
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:31,320
Define civilization then we should
 

885
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,810
Define civilization then we should
expect to see like massive differences

886
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:32,820
expect to see like massive differences
 

887
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,009

Terror management Theory where they do

898
00:15:42,769 --> 00:15:42,779
Terror management Theory where they do
 

899
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:45,230
Terror management Theory where they do
type write psychology type papers and

900
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:45,240
type write psychology type papers and
 

901
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,670
type write psychology type papers and
they do actual experiments I can mention

902
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:46,680
they do actual experiments I can mention
 

903
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,910
they do actual experiments I can mention
how their methodology is interesting

904
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:49,920
how their methodology is interesting
 

905
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,769
how their methodology is interesting
um they Prime with the discussion of

906
00:15:51,769 --> 00:15:51,779
um they Prime with the discussion of
 

907
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:53,810
um they Prime with the discussion of
death like they take one certain set of

908
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:53,820
death like they take one certain set of
 

909
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,370
death like they take one certain set of
people and have a conversation with them

910
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:55,380
people and have a conversation with them
 

911
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,930
people and have a conversation with them
another set of people they mentioned

912
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:56,940
another set of people they mentioned
 

913
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,730
another set of people they mentioned
death to them before the conversation

914
00:15:58,730 --> 00:15:58,740
death to them before the conversation
 

915
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:01,550
death to them before the conversation
and see how that affects their uh the

916
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:01,560
and see how that affects their uh the
 

917
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,629
and see how that affects their uh the
nature of the conversation it's really

918
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:02,639
nature of the conversation it's really
 

919
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,850
nature of the conversation it's really
interesting because death fundamentally

920
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:04,860

921
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,050

discussion then you have to get rigorous

970
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:50,940
discussion then you have to get rigorous
 

971
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,730
discussion then you have to get rigorous
with it for sure

972
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:52,740

988
00:17:13,309 --> 00:17:13,319
that makes it easier for them to forget
 

989
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:16,010
that makes it easier for them to forget
to escape that Terror but everybody else

990
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:16,020
to escape that Terror but everybody else
 

991
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,510

00:17:25,549 --> 00:17:25,559
itself like the rat race for getting
 

1001
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:26,990

more and more material possessions and
 

1003
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,210
more and more material possessions and
so on and couldn't you argue in the

00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:29,220
so on and couldn't you argue in the
 

1005
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,190
so on and couldn't you argue in the
opposite direction like let's say assume

1006
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:31,200
opposite direction like let's say assume
 

1007
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,150
opposite direction like let's say assume
that we're Christians here and we're

1008
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:32,160
that we're Christians here and we're
 

1009
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,530
that we're Christians here and we're
like oh the atheists you know everybody

1010
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:33,540
like oh the atheists you know everybody
 

1011
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,210
like oh the atheists you know everybody
has Terror of hell and the atheists

1012
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:35,220
has Terror of hell and the atheists
 

1013
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,950
has Terror of hell and the atheists
invent this mythology where you know

1014
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:36,960
invent this mythology where you know
 

1015
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,810
invent this mythology where you know
actually evolution is true in order to

1016
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:38,820
actually evolution is true in order to
 

1017
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,990
actually evolution is true in order to
escape their Terror of hell so it

1018
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:42,000
escape their Terror of hell so it
 

1019
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,490
escape their Terror of hell so it
doesn't feel like a persuasive argument

1020
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:43,500
doesn't feel like a persuasive argument
 

1021
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,409
doesn't feel like a persuasive argument
to me but I used to be very very

1022
00:17:45,409 --> 00:17:45,419
to me but I used to be very very
 

1023
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:48,470
to me but I used to be very very
Christian and I did not have a terror of

1024
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:48,480
Christian and I did not have a terror of
 

1025
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,150
Christian and I did not have a terror of
death and then I lost my faith and then

1026
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:50,160
death and then I lost my faith and then
 

1027
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,190
death and then I lost my faith and then
I had a deep Terror of death set in for

1028
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:52,200
I had a deep Terror of death set in for
 

1029
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,870
I had a deep Terror of death set in for
a few years and it felt very different

1030
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:53,880
a few years and it felt very different
 

1031
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,110
a few years and it felt very different
to me so for denial of death I don't

1032
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:57,120
to me so for denial of death I don't
 

1033
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,909
to me so for denial of death I don't
know if he says that it's actually

1034
00:17:58,909 --> 00:17:58,919
know if he says that it's actually
 

1035
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:00,710
know if he says that it's actually
possible without

1036
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:00,720
possible without
 

1037
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,110
possible without
really a lot of work to get to the

1038
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:03,120
really a lot of work to get to the
 

1039
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,690
really a lot of work to get to the
actual Terror like I think his claims

1040
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:05,700
actual Terror like I think his claims
 

1041
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,090
actual Terror like I think his claims
that in early early early childhood

1042
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:08,100
that in early early early childhood
 

1043
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,110
that in early early early childhood
development

1044
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:09,120
development
 

1045
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,330
development
that's when the terror is real

1046
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:11,340
that's when the terror is real
 

1047
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,789
that's when the terror is real
and then we come aggressively construct

1048
00:18:13,789 --> 00:18:13,799
and then we come aggressively construct
 

1049
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:16,610
and then we come aggressively construct
systems around it of social interaction

1050
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:16,620
systems around it of social interaction
 

1051
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,350
systems around it of social interaction
to to um

1052
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:18,360
to to um
 

1053
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,970
to to um
to support to sort of construct

1054
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:19,980
to support to sort of construct
 

1055
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,310
to support to sort of construct
illusions at the top of it I'm doing a

1056
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:22,320
illusions at the top of it I'm doing a
 

1057
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,930
illusions at the top of it I'm doing a
half-assed description of this

1058
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:23,940
half-assed description of this
 

1059
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:27,470
half-assed description of this
philosophy but there is like it isn't

1060
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:27,480
philosophy but there is like it isn't
 

1061
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,210
philosophy but there is like it isn't
interesting to simplify

1062
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:29,220
interesting to simplify
 

1063
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:32,770
interesting to simplify
the human mind into underlying

1064
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:32,780
the human mind into underlying
 

1065
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:35,150
the human mind into underlying
mechanisms that drive it

1066
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:35,160
mechanisms that drive it
 

1067
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,830
mechanisms that drive it
yeah I was gonna say your thinking seems

1068
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:36,840
yeah I was gonna say your thinking seems
 

1069
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,630
yeah I was gonna say your thinking seems
kind of poetic like the way that you're

1070
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:38,640
kind of poetic like the way that you're
 

1071
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,430
kind of poetic like the way that you're
sort of handling these yeah these

1072
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:40,440
sort of handling these yeah these
 

1073
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,110
sort of handling these yeah these
Concepts feel like more like

1074
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:42,120
Concepts feel like more like
 

1075
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,970
Concepts feel like more like
aesthetically driven I think this theme

1076
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:43,980
aesthetically driven I think this theme
 

1077
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,169
aesthetically driven I think this theme
is going to continue throughout this

1078
00:18:45,169 --> 00:18:45,179
is going to continue throughout this
 

1079
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:46,310
is going to continue throughout this
conversation as we talk about

1080
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:46,320
conversation as we talk about
 

1081
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,130
conversation as we talk about
relationships and sex yes for sure I

1082
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:49,140
relationships and sex yes for sure I
 

1083
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:52,130
relationships and sex yes for sure I
think so and I think you're thinking

1084
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:52,140
think so and I think you're thinking
 

1085
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,529
think so and I think you're thinking
seems to be very driven by how can I

1086
00:18:54,529 --> 00:18:54,539
seems to be very driven by how can I
 

1087
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:56,210
seems to be very driven by how can I
construct an experiment

1088
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:56,220
construct an experiment
 

1089
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:59,510
construct an experiment
to test this hypothesis yeah something

1090
00:18:59,510 --> 00:18:59,520
to test this hypothesis yeah something
 

1091
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,529
to test this hypothesis yeah something
like that yeah but aren't there's some

1092
00:19:03,529 --> 00:19:03,539
like that yeah but aren't there's some
 

1093
00:19:03,539 --> 00:19:04,850
like that yeah but aren't there's some
things especially that have to do with

1094
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:04,860
things especially that have to do with
 

1095
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:07,250
things especially that have to do with
the human mind that are really messy

1096
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:07,260
the human mind that are really messy
 

1097
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,450
the human mind that are really messy
really difficult to understand there's

1098
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:08,460
really difficult to understand there's
 

1099
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,950
really difficult to understand there's
so many uncertainties and Mysteries

1100
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:09,960
so many uncertainties and Mysteries
 

1101
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,289
so many uncertainties and Mysteries
around that we don't yet have the tools

1102
00:19:12,289 --> 00:19:12,299
around that we don't yet have the tools
 

1103
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:14,510
around that we don't yet have the tools
to collect the data like one of your

1104
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:14,520
to collect the data like one of your
 

1105
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,510
to collect the data like one of your
favorite tools is the survey is asking

1106
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:17,520
favorite tools is the survey is asking
 

1107
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,710
favorite tools is the survey is asking
people questions

1108
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:18,720
people questions
 

1109
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,930
people questions
and then figuring out different ways to

1110
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:20,940
and then figuring out different ways to
 

1111
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:23,150
and then figuring out different ways to
indirectly get at the truth because

1112
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:23,160
indirectly get at the truth because
 

1113
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,890
indirectly get at the truth because
there's flaws to the survey and you you

1114
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:24,900
there's flaws to the survey and you you
 

1115
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,270
there's flaws to the survey and you you
kind of learn about those flaws and you

1116
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:26,280
kind of learn about those flaws and you
 

1117
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,650
kind of learn about those flaws and you
get better and better asking the right

1118
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:27,660
get better and better asking the right
 

1119
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,750
get better and better asking the right
questions and so on but that's not

1120
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:29,760
questions and so on but that's not
 

1121
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,909
questions and so on but that's not
that's indirect access to the human mind

1122
00:19:31,909 --> 00:19:31,919
that's indirect access to the human mind
 

1123
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,130
that's indirect access to the human mind
but do you think like Poetic narratives

1124
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:34,140
but do you think like Poetic narratives
 

1125
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,529
but do you think like Poetic narratives
are I'm not like saying poetic

1126
00:19:36,529 --> 00:19:36,539
are I'm not like saying poetic
 

1127
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:37,610
are I'm not like saying poetic
narratives are bad like I think it's

1128
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:37,620
narratives are bad like I think it's
 

1129
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,289
narratives are bad like I think it's
like a cool way of like handling

1130
00:19:39,289 --> 00:19:39,299
like a cool way of like handling
 

1131
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:41,210
like a cool way of like handling
Concepts but I'm not sure that they are

1132
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:41,220
Concepts but I'm not sure that they are
 

1133
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:44,870
Concepts but I'm not sure that they are
more rigorous no no no okay no but like

1134
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:44,880
more rigorous no no no okay no but like
 

1135
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,250
more rigorous no no no okay no but like
they might be

1136
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:46,260
they might be
 

1137
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,650
they might be
the more correct like philosophy might

1138
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:48,660
the more correct like philosophy might
 

1139
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,270
the more correct like philosophy might
be the right way to discuss things that

1140
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:50,280
be the right way to discuss things that
 

1141
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,490
be the right way to discuss things that
were really far from understanding yeah

1142
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:52,500
were really far from understanding yeah
 

1143
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,570
were really far from understanding yeah
I mean they might be more useful

1144
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:53,580
I mean they might be more useful
 

1145
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:56,210
I mean they might be more useful
shorthand yeah like morality like I

1146
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:56,220
shorthand yeah like morality like I
 

1147
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,350
shorthand yeah like morality like I
don't think morality makes any sense but

1148
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:57,360
don't think morality makes any sense but
 

1149
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,210
don't think morality makes any sense but
it's really useful shorthand to use when

1150
00:19:59,210 --> 00:19:59,220
it's really useful shorthand to use when
 

1151
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:02,029
it's really useful shorthand to use when
handling Concepts and a lot of the time

1152
00:20:02,029 --> 00:20:02,039
handling Concepts and a lot of the time
 

1153
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:04,010
handling Concepts and a lot of the time
right like ethics and morality you could

1154
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:04,020
right like ethics and morality you could
 

1155
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,450
right like ethics and morality you could
construct studies that ask different

1156
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:05,460
construct studies that ask different
 

1157
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,669
construct studies that ask different
questions like uh you know just having

1158
00:20:07,669 --> 00:20:07,679
questions like uh you know just having
 

1159
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,529
questions like uh you know just having
worked with the autonomous vehicles a

1160
00:20:09,529 --> 00:20:09,539
worked with the autonomous vehicles a
 

1161
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:11,990
worked with the autonomous vehicles a
lot the uh the trolley problem gets

1162
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:12,000
lot the uh the trolley problem gets
 

1163
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,490
lot the uh the trolley problem gets
brought up and I don't know you can

1164
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:13,500
brought up and I don't know you can
 

1165
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,010
brought up and I don't know you can
construct all kinds of interesting

1166
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:15,020
construct all kinds of interesting
 

1167
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,090
construct all kinds of interesting
surveys about the trolley problem but

1168
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:17,100
surveys about the trolley problem but
 

1169
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:20,150
surveys about the trolley problem but
does that really get at some deep

1170
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:20,160
does that really get at some deep
 

1171
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:24,110
does that really get at some deep
moral calculus that humans do it's sexy

1172
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:24,120
moral calculus that humans do it's sexy
 

1173
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,450
moral calculus that humans do it's sexy
because people like write clickbait

1174
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:26,460
because people like write clickbait
 

1175
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,549
because people like write clickbait
articles about it but does it really get

1176
00:20:28,549 --> 00:20:28,559
articles about it but does it really get
 

1177
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:31,490
articles about it but does it really get
to like what you value more five

1178
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:31,500
to like what you value more five
 

1179
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,730
to like what you value more five
grandmas or like three children or

1180
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:34,740
grandmas or like three children or
 

1181
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,950
grandmas or like three children or
whatever like they construct these

1182
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:36,960
whatever like they construct these
 

1183
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,289
whatever like they construct these
arguments of like if you could steer a

1184
00:20:39,289 --> 00:20:39,299
arguments of like if you could steer a
 

1185
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:40,789
arguments of like if you could steer a
train if you could steer an autonomous

1186
00:20:40,789 --> 00:20:40,799
train if you could steer an autonomous
 

1187
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,289
train if you could steer an autonomous
car which do you choose

1188
00:20:42,289 --> 00:20:42,299
car which do you choose
 

1189
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:44,390
car which do you choose
yeah I don't know I don't know if it's

1190
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:44,400
yeah I don't know I don't know if it's
 

1191
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,610
yeah I don't know I don't know if it's
possible with some of those to construct

1192
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:46,620
possible with some of those to construct
 

1193
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,890
possible with some of those to construct
like sometimes the fuzzy area

1194
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:48,900
like sometimes the fuzzy area
 

1195
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,630
like sometimes the fuzzy area
there's some topics that are fuzzing

1196
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:50,640
there's some topics that are fuzzing
 

1197
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,850
there's some topics that are fuzzing
will forever be fuzzy

1198
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:52,860
will forever be fuzzy
 

1199
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,890
will forever be fuzzy
given our limited cognitive capabilities

1200
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:54,900
given our limited cognitive capabilities
 

1201
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,570
given our limited cognitive capabilities
I don't know there's a way of looking at

1202
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:56,580
I don't know there's a way of looking at
 

1203
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,010
I don't know there's a way of looking at
things where it's like for example the

1204
00:20:58,010 --> 00:20:58,020
things where it's like for example the
 

1205
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,630
things where it's like for example the
childhood fetish thing that I was

1206
00:20:59,630 --> 00:20:59,640
childhood fetish thing that I was
 

1207
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,529
childhood fetish thing that I was
talking about like departed your

1208
00:21:00,529 --> 00:21:00,539
talking about like departed your
 

1209
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:01,610
talking about like departed your
footages come from like you can develop

1210
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:01,620
footages come from like you can develop
 

1211
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,110
footages come from like you can develop
a narrative where it's like you know I

1212
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:03,120
a narrative where it's like you know I
 

1213
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,970
a narrative where it's like you know I
think like this kind of thing is you

1214
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:04,980
think like this kind of thing is you
 

1215
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,230
think like this kind of thing is you
know you're surrounded by feet when

1216
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:06,240
know you're surrounded by feet when
 

1217
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,510
know you're surrounded by feet when
you're a child this causes foot fetishes

1218
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:08,520
you're a child this causes foot fetishes
 

1219
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,890
you're a child this causes foot fetishes
um and this is like kind of a cool

1220
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:09,900
um and this is like kind of a cool
 

1221
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,110
um and this is like kind of a cool
narrative uh and I think a lot of

1222
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:12,120
narrative uh and I think a lot of
 

1223
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,970
narrative uh and I think a lot of
people's ideas about philosophy follow

1224
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:13,980
people's ideas about philosophy follow
 

1225
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,890
people's ideas about philosophy follow
the same sort of thing like what is the

1226
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:15,900
the same sort of thing like what is the
 

1227
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,210
the same sort of thing like what is the
narrative that is cool and I think this

1228
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:17,220
narrative that is cool and I think this
 

1229
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,710
narrative that is cool and I think this
is useful for meaning making like I'm

1230
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:18,720
is useful for meaning making like I'm
 

1231
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,810
is useful for meaning making like I'm
very Pro meaning making like when you're

1232
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:20,820
very Pro meaning making like when you're
 

1233
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:23,270
very Pro meaning making like when you're
talking about everything is uh fun

1234
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:23,280
talking about everything is uh fun
 

1235
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,090
talking about everything is uh fun
because you know the contrast or

1236
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:26,100
because you know the contrast or
 

1237
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,950
because you know the contrast or
whatever I've very much just ascribed to

1238
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:27,960
whatever I've very much just ascribed to
 

1239
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,049
whatever I've very much just ascribed to
that I really enjoy that that philosophy

1240
00:21:30,049 --> 00:21:30,059
that I really enjoy that that philosophy
 

1241
00:21:30,059 --> 00:21:31,850
that I really enjoy that that philosophy
I also find everything to be very

1242
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:31,860
I also find everything to be very
 

1243
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,890
I also find everything to be very
delightful uh but and this isn't like a

1244
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:33,900
delightful uh but and this isn't like a
 

1245
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,210
delightful uh but and this isn't like a
question of truth right we're not like

1246
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:35,220
question of truth right we're not like
 

1247
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,649
question of truth right we're not like
where is the true Delight that we're

1248
00:21:36,649 --> 00:21:36,659
where is the true Delight that we're
 

1249
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:38,330
where is the true Delight that we're
objectively measuring I guess there's a

1250
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:38,340
objectively measuring I guess there's a
 

1251
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,830
objectively measuring I guess there's a
frame a poetic frame that you're using

1252
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:39,840
frame a poetic frame that you're using
 

1253
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,570
frame a poetic frame that you're using
to like sort of change the way the light

1254
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:41,580
to like sort of change the way the light
 

1255
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,909
to like sort of change the way the light
hits the world around you and that's

1256
00:21:43,909 --> 00:21:43,919
hits the world around you and that's
 

1257
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:46,070
hits the world around you and that's
super useful because it like makes you

1258
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:46,080
super useful because it like makes you
 

1259
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,149
super useful because it like makes you
happier

1260
00:21:47,149 --> 00:21:47,159
happier
 

1261
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:49,370
happier
or something

1262
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:49,380
or something
 

1263
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,649
or something
yeah but also gets

1264
00:21:51,649 --> 00:21:51,659
yeah but also gets
 

1265
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:53,870
yeah but also gets
to the truth or something

1266
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:53,880
to the truth or something
 

1267
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:58,730
to the truth or something
yeah I guess what is the truth

1268
00:21:58,730 --> 00:21:58,740

 

1269
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:01,490

um yet another question what is truth

1270
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:01,500
um yet another question what is truth
 

1271
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,649
um yet another question what is truth
you've uh

1272
00:22:03,649 --> 00:22:03,659
you've uh
 

1273
00:22:03,659 --> 00:22:06,529
you've uh
actually to jump back you don't you

1274
00:22:06,529 --> 00:22:06,539
actually to jump back you don't you
 

1275
00:22:06,539 --> 00:22:09,649
actually to jump back you don't you
believe that Free Will is an illusion um

1276
00:22:09,649 --> 00:22:09,659
believe that Free Will is an illusion um
 

1277
00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:11,630
believe that Free Will is an illusion um
so uh

1278
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:11,640
so uh
 

1279
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,330
so uh
why does it feel like

1280
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:14,340
why does it feel like
 

1281
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:17,870
why does it feel like
I'm free to make any decision I want

1282
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:17,880
I'm free to make any decision I want
 

1283
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,270
I'm free to make any decision I want
well it's a cool illusion I think it's

1284
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:20,280
well it's a cool illusion I think it's
 

1285
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,549
well it's a cool illusion I think it's
probably like where a sense of identity

1286
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:21,559
probably like where a sense of identity
 

1287
00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:24,230
probably like where a sense of identity
oh like when you really meditate on your

1288
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:24,240
oh like when you really meditate on your
 

1289
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,090
oh like when you really meditate on your
sense of identity for at least for me it

1290
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:26,100
sense of identity for at least for me it
 

1291
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,409
sense of identity for at least for me it
seems like it comes down to the sense of

1292
00:22:27,409 --> 00:22:27,419
seems like it comes down to the sense of
 

1293
00:22:27,419 --> 00:22:29,630
seems like it comes down to the sense of
choice like oh I am doing the thinking

1294
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:29,640
choice like oh I am doing the thinking
 

1295
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,649
choice like oh I am doing the thinking
like what does it mean to do with

1296
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:30,659
like what does it mean to do with
 

1297
00:22:30,659 --> 00:22:32,450
like what does it mean to do with
thinking it's like ah something in me

1298
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:32,460
thinking it's like ah something in me
 

1299
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,470
thinking it's like ah something in me
has

1300
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:33,480
has
 

1301
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,570
has
exerted agency over having this thought

1302
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:35,580
exerted agency over having this thought
 

1303
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,190
exerted agency over having this thought
or not having this thought

1304
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:37,200
or not having this thought
 

1305
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,230
or not having this thought
like the sense of self really comes down

1306
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:39,240
like the sense of self really comes down
 

1307
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,970
like the sense of self really comes down
to choice and so when I say that like

1308
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:40,980
to choice and so when I say that like
 

1309
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,350
to choice and so when I say that like
free will listen illusion I also mean

1310
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:42,360
free will listen illusion I also mean
 

1311
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,850
free will listen illusion I also mean
there's something like the selfish

1312
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:43,860
there's something like the selfish
 

1313
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,710
there's something like the selfish
illusion identity is

1314
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:45,720
illusion identity is
 

1315
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,630
illusion identity is
a trick of the light

1316
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:47,640
a trick of the light
 

1317
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,789
a trick of the light
but it's a really fun one yeah you think

1318
00:22:49,789 --> 00:22:49,799
but it's a really fun one yeah you think
 

1319
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:52,010
but it's a really fun one yeah you think
a lot about your identity

1320
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:52,020
a lot about your identity
 

1321
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:55,549
a lot about your identity
I have occasionally yeah like you really

delight in it I used to be very into
 

1331
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,529
delight in it I used to be very into
like deconstructing it like you probably

1332
00:23:06,529 --> 00:23:06,539
like deconstructing it like you probably
 

1333
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:08,570
like deconstructing it like you probably
you know I did a bunch of like way too

much LSD for a while and at that point
 

1337
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:14,090
much LSD for a while and at that point

more than you do it's interesting that's
 

1347
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:24,710
more than you do it's interesting that's
fascinating wait could you could you

1348
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:24,720
fascinating wait could you could you
 

1349
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,450
fascinating wait could you could you
solve my problems yes all of them I've

1350
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:26,460
solve my problems yes all of them I've
 

1351
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,970
solve my problems yes all of them I've
did thorough research okay

1352
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:28,980
did thorough research okay
 

1353
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:29,690
did thorough research okay
um

1354
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:29,700
um
 

1355
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,270
um
what is consciousness then

1356
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:32,280
what is consciousness then
 

1357
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,950
what is consciousness then
I actually wrote that as a question what

1358
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:33,960
I actually wrote that as a question what
 

1359
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,350
I actually wrote that as a question what
is consciousness

1360
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:36,360
is consciousness
 

1361
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,770
is consciousness
to remind myself so like uh how's that

1362
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:39,780
to remind myself so like uh how's that
 

1363
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,090
to remind myself so like uh how's that
tie in together with Free Will and

1364
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:41,100
tie in together with Free Will and
 

1365
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,490
tie in together with Free Will and
identity and all of that it doesn't mean

1366
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:43,500
identity and all of that it doesn't mean
 

1367
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,990
identity and all of that it doesn't mean
what his Consciousness is like one of

1368
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:45,000
what his Consciousness is like one of
 

1369
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,330
what his Consciousness is like one of
the biggest questions ever I think I I

1370
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:47,340
the biggest questions ever I think I I
 

1371
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,830
the biggest questions ever I think I I
do think that people often get confused

1372
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:48,840
do think that people often get confused
 

1373
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,850
do think that people often get confused
when talking about Consciousness because

1374
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:49,860
when talking about Consciousness because
 

1375
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,289
when talking about Consciousness because
I think people are referring to two

1376
00:23:51,289 --> 00:23:51,299
I think people are referring to two
 

1377
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:52,789
I think people are referring to two
separate Concepts and often like

1378
00:23:52,789 --> 00:23:52,799
separate Concepts and often like
 

1379
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,649
separate Concepts and often like
combining them into one thing like we

1380
00:23:54,649 --> 00:23:54,659
combining them into one thing like we
 

1381
00:23:54,659 --> 00:23:56,270
combining them into one thing like we
asked the question you know is AI going

1382
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:56,280
asked the question you know is AI going
 

1383
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,890
asked the question you know is AI going
to be conscious

1384
00:23:57,890 --> 00:23:57,900
to be conscious
 

1385
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,029
to be conscious
um I think this is kind of the wrong

1386
00:23:59,029 --> 00:23:59,039
um I think this is kind of the wrong
 

1387
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:02,390
um I think this is kind of the wrong
question like uh like like we can

1388
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:02,400
question like uh like like we can
 

1389
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,250
question like uh like like we can
identify signs of Consciousness like ah

1390
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:04,260
identify signs of Consciousness like ah
 

1391
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,289
identify signs of Consciousness like ah
they seem to refer to themselves but

1392
00:24:06,289 --> 00:24:06,299
they seem to refer to themselves but
 

1393
00:24:06,299 --> 00:24:07,430
they seem to refer to themselves but
this is not necessarily proof of

1394
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:07,440
this is not necessarily proof of
 

1395
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,810
this is not necessarily proof of
Consciousness in the same way that like

1396
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:08,820
Consciousness in the same way that like
 

1397
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,370
Consciousness in the same way that like
dream characters

1398
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:10,380
dream characters
 

1399
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,350
dream characters
acting exactly the way normal human do

1400
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:12,360
acting exactly the way normal human do
 

1401
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,090
acting exactly the way normal human do
people do in your dream is not evidence

1402
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:14,100
people do in your dream is not evidence
 

1403
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,490
people do in your dream is not evidence
that they themselves are conscious so

1404
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:16,500
that they themselves are conscious so
 

1405
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,049
that they themselves are conscious so
like signs of Consciousness are not

1406
00:24:18,049 --> 00:24:18,059
like signs of Consciousness are not
 

1407
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:19,310
like signs of Consciousness are not
proof of Consciousness but there is

1408
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:19,320
proof of Consciousness but there is
 

1409
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,049
proof of Consciousness but there is
something that we definitely know which

1410
00:24:21,049 --> 00:24:21,059
something that we definitely know which
 

1411
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:22,909
something that we definitely know which
is like I currently am conscious I can

1412
00:24:22,909 --> 00:24:22,919
is like I currently am conscious I can
 

1413
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:24,590
is like I currently am conscious I can
tell because

1414
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:24,600
tell because
 

1415
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,049
tell because
right like I'm like just directly

1416
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:27,059
right like I'm like just directly
 

1417
00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:29,210
right like I'm like just directly
observing my experience yeah uh and so

1418
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:29,220
observing my experience yeah uh and so
 

1419
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,350
observing my experience yeah uh and so
like there's one kind of Consciousness

1420
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:30,360
like there's one kind of Consciousness
 

1421
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,669
like there's one kind of Consciousness
which is I am directly observing my

1422
00:24:31,669 --> 00:24:31,679
which is I am directly observing my
 

1423
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,590
which is I am directly observing my
experience and that you cannot replicate

1424
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:33,600
experience and that you cannot replicate
 

1425
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,330
experience and that you cannot replicate
it like there I cannot observe two

1426
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:35,340
it like there I cannot observe two
 

1427
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,370
it like there I cannot observe two
experiences uh it is necessarily

1428
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:37,380
experiences uh it is necessarily
 

1429
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,169
experiences uh it is necessarily
singular and it is necessarily certain

1430
00:24:39,169 --> 00:24:39,179
singular and it is necessarily certain
 

1431
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:40,909
singular and it is necessarily certain
like you can make all the arguments you

1432
00:24:40,909 --> 00:24:40,919
like you can make all the arguments you
 

1433
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:43,430
like you can make all the arguments you
want like I'm still directly observing

1434
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:43,440
want like I'm still directly observing
 

1435
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,870
want like I'm still directly observing
it's not a thing that's subject to

1436
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:44,880
it's not a thing that's subject to
 

1437
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,610
it's not a thing that's subject to
reason whereas are other things

1438
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:46,620
reason whereas are other things
 

1439
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:47,810
reason whereas are other things
conscious this is something that's

1440
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:47,820
conscious this is something that's
 

1441
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,789
conscious this is something that's
replicable like you can apply it to

1442
00:24:49,789 --> 00:24:49,799
replicable like you can apply it to
 

1443
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:50,990
replicable like you can apply it to
multiple people

1444
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:51,000
multiple people
 

1445
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,850
multiple people
um it's something that's not certain uh

1446
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:52,860
um it's something that's not certain uh
 

1447
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,289
um it's something that's not certain uh
like almost definitionally not certain

1448
00:24:54,289 --> 00:24:54,299
like almost definitionally not certain
 

1449
00:24:54,299 --> 00:24:55,789
like almost definitionally not certain
like we don't actually know if there is

1450
00:24:55,789 --> 00:24:55,799
like we don't actually know if there is
 

1451
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:58,010
like we don't actually know if there is
you know an internal experience so my

1452
00:24:58,010 --> 00:24:58,020
you know an internal experience so my
 

1453
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,090
you know an internal experience so my
argument is that like when people are

1454
00:24:59,090 --> 00:24:59,100
argument is that like when people are
 

1455
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,590
argument is that like when people are
talking about other things having

1456
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:00,600
talking about other things having
 

1457
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,909
talking about other things having
experienced they're using a different

1458
00:25:01,909 --> 00:25:01,919
experienced they're using a different
 

1459
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:03,649
experienced they're using a different
concept than the thing that they're

1460
00:25:03,649 --> 00:25:03,659
concept than the thing that they're
 

1461
00:25:03,659 --> 00:25:05,210
concept than the thing that they're
actually looking at when they look at

1462
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:05,220
actually looking at when they look at
 

1463
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,649
actually looking at when they look at
their own experience I think they're two

1464
00:25:06,649 --> 00:25:06,659
their own experience I think they're two
 

1465
00:25:06,659 --> 00:25:08,409
their own experience I think they're two
different things

1466
00:25:08,409 --> 00:25:08,419
different things
 

1467
00:25:08,419 --> 00:25:11,810
different things
definitionally not possible no if you

1468
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:11,820
definitionally not possible no if you
 

1469
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:12,770
definitionally not possible no if you
understand the mechanism of

1470
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:12,780
understand the mechanism of
 

1471
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,149
understand the mechanism of
Consciousness you'll be able to measure

1472
00:25:14,149 --> 00:25:14,159
Consciousness you'll be able to measure
 

1473
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:15,830
Consciousness you'll be able to measure
it probably right yeah but what are you

1474
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:15,840
it probably right yeah but what are you
 

1475
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,510
it probably right yeah but what are you
measuring like I think this is like a

1476
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:17,520
measuring like I think this is like a
 

1477
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,070
measuring like I think this is like a
subtle difference like when you're

1478
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:19,080
subtle difference like when you're
 

1479
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,510
subtle difference like when you're
asking the quest is other thing

1480
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:20,520
asking the quest is other thing
 

1481
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,830
asking the quest is other thing
conscious

1482
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:21,840
conscious
 

1483
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,169
conscious
yeah the easy thing to measure is like a

1484
00:25:24,169 --> 00:25:24,179
yeah the easy thing to measure is like a
 

1485
00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:26,269
yeah the easy thing to measure is like a
survey does this thing appear conscious

1486
00:25:26,269 --> 00:25:26,279
survey does this thing appear conscious
 

1487
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:28,430
survey does this thing appear conscious
yeah and then the hard thing is you

1488
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:28,440
yeah and then the hard thing is you
 

1489
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,010
yeah and then the hard thing is you
understand the actual mechanism of how

1490
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:31,020
understand the actual mechanism of how
 

1491
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,990
understand the actual mechanism of how
Consciousness arises

1492
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:33,000
Consciousness arises
 

1493
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,450
Consciousness arises
in the physics of the people do that in

1494
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:35,460
in the physics of the people do that in
 

1495
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,010
in the physics of the people do that in
a dream presumably like if you had a

1496
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:37,020
a dream presumably like if you had a
 

1497
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:37,970
a dream presumably like if you had a
very good dream or a very good

1498
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:37,980
very good dream or a very good
 

1499
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:40,730
very good dream or a very good
simulation yeah but we could then have

1500
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:40,740
simulation yeah but we could then have
 

1501
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,049
simulation yeah but we could then have
somebody in a simulation or a dream

1502
00:25:42,049 --> 00:25:42,059
somebody in a simulation or a dream
 

1503
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:43,250
somebody in a simulation or a dream
where they go through and they fully

1504
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:43,260
where they go through and they fully
 

1505
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:44,690
where they go through and they fully
understand you know they do all the

1506
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:44,700
understand you know they do all the
 

1507
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,010
understand you know they do all the
tests and the tests come back exactly

1508
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:46,020
tests and the tests come back exactly
 

1509
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:48,590
tests and the tests come back exactly
they'd expect them to uh but from the

1510
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:48,600
they'd expect them to uh but from the
 

1511
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,549
they'd expect them to uh but from the
outside we're like well this is

1512
00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:49,559
outside we're like well this is
 

1513
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:50,450
outside we're like well this is
misleading they're not actually

1514
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:50,460
misleading they're not actually
 

1515
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,590
misleading they're not actually
conscious

1516
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:51,600
conscious
 

1517
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,970
conscious
like your dream characters aren't

1518
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:52,980
like your dream characters aren't
 

1519
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,769
like your dream characters aren't
conscious right probably I don't know

1520
00:25:54,769 --> 00:25:54,779
conscious right probably I don't know
 

1521
00:25:54,779 --> 00:25:56,690
conscious right probably I don't know
are you asking are you telling I'm like

1522
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:56,700
are you asking are you telling I'm like
 

1523
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,630
are you asking are you telling I'm like
appealing to an intuition

1524
00:25:58,630 --> 00:25:58,640
appealing to an intuition
 

1525
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,470
appealing to an intuition
but it sounds like you're driving

1526
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:00,480
but it sounds like you're driving
 

1527
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,090
but it sounds like you're driving
towards a narrative I don't you you did

1528
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:02,100
towards a narrative I don't you you did
 

1529
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,830
towards a narrative I don't you you did
a poll about men and women and Dreams

1530
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:03,840
a poll about men and women and Dreams
 

1531
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,169
a poll about men and women and Dreams
yeah those are some kind of difference I

1532
00:26:06,169 --> 00:26:06,179
yeah those are some kind of difference I
 

1533
00:26:06,179 --> 00:26:07,310
yeah those are some kind of difference I
couldn't tell what the difference was

1534
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:07,320
couldn't tell what the difference was
 

1535
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,289
couldn't tell what the difference was
except that more men than women quite a

1536
00:26:09,289 --> 00:26:09,299
except that more men than women quite a
 

1537
00:26:09,299 --> 00:26:12,169
except that more men than women quite a
lot more women dream vividly than men oh

1538
00:26:12,169 --> 00:26:12,179
lot more women dream vividly than men oh
 

1539
00:26:12,179 --> 00:26:13,730
lot more women dream vividly than men oh
which I actually found my chaos survey

1540
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:13,740
which I actually found my chaos survey
 

1541
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,710
which I actually found my chaos survey
it's like I did a survey maybe you know

1542
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:15,720
it's like I did a survey maybe you know
 

1543
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,289
it's like I did a survey maybe you know
that I said I don't know everything you

1544
00:26:18,289 --> 00:26:18,299
that I said I don't know everything you
 

1545
00:26:18,299 --> 00:26:20,029
that I said I don't know everything you
do know yes I'm sorry so as you clearly

1546
00:26:20,029 --> 00:26:20,039
do know yes I'm sorry so as you clearly
 

1547
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:21,890
do know yes I'm sorry so as you clearly
know I'll try not to talk down to this

1548
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:21,900
know I'll try not to talk down to this
 

1549
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,450
know I'll try not to talk down to this
conversation because I don't know and I

1550
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:23,460
conversation because I don't know and I
 

1551
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:26,390
conversation because I don't know and I
not only know everything I know how your

1552
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:26,400
not only know everything I know how your
 

1553
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,909
not only know everything I know how your
future looks like really and every how

1554
00:26:28,909 --> 00:26:28,919
future looks like really and every how
 

1555
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:30,350
future looks like really and every how
everything ends yeah so you could

1556
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:30,360
everything ends yeah so you could
 

1557
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,669
everything ends yeah so you could
probably win all the prediction markets

1558
00:26:31,669 --> 00:26:31,679
probably win all the prediction markets
 

1559
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,310
probably win all the prediction markets
on my life yeah cool so well we should

1560
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:34,320
on my life yeah cool so well we should
 

1561
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,210
on my life yeah cool so well we should
also mention that you have like

1562
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:35,220
also mention that you have like
 

1563
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,490
also mention that you have like
prediction markets uh you have like

1564
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:37,500
prediction markets uh you have like
 

1565
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,890
prediction markets uh you have like
votes that you what what's the site

1566
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:39,900
votes that you what what's the site
 

1567
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,529
votes that you what what's the site
called again manifold manifold and one

1568
00:26:42,529 --> 00:26:42,539
called again manifold manifold and one
 

1569
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:44,330
called again manifold manifold and one
of them was will I be on the Lex

1570
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:44,340
of them was will I be on the Lex
 

1571
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:47,510
of them was will I be on the Lex
Friedman podcast yeah and I voted I

1572
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:47,520
Friedman podcast yeah and I voted I
 

1573
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,850
Friedman podcast yeah and I voted I
invested everything I own into the yes

1574
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:49,860
invested everything I own into the yes
 

1575
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:52,669
invested everything I own into the yes
is there such thing as Fighters radio on

1576
00:26:52,669 --> 00:26:52,679
is there such thing as Fighters radio on
 

1577
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:54,409
is there such thing as Fighters radio on
there is that it goes against the terms

1578
00:26:54,409 --> 00:26:54,419
there is that it goes against the terms
 

1579
00:26:54,419 --> 00:26:57,110
there is that it goes against the terms
no I think inside attorney is part of

1580
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:57,120
no I think inside attorney is part of
 

1581
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,970
no I think inside attorney is part of
the information so it's supposed to be

1582
00:26:58,970 --> 00:26:58,980
the information so it's supposed to be
 

1583
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,590
the information so it's supposed to be
and then I realized it's actually public

1584
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:00,600
and then I realized it's actually public
 

1585
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,810
and then I realized it's actually public
information that I voted because like I

1586
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:02,820
information that I voted because like I
 

1587
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,789
information that I voted because like I
think my face shows up there's like damn

1588
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:04,799
think my face shows up there's like damn
 

1589
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:07,850
think my face shows up there's like damn
it it's gonna influence

1590
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:07,860
it it's gonna influence
 

1591
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,529
it it's gonna influence
you could make the fake account or I

1592
00:27:09,529 --> 00:27:09,539
you could make the fake account or I
 

1593
00:27:09,539 --> 00:27:12,110
you could make the fake account or I
could be lying right yeah and then dump

1594
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:12,120
could be lying right yeah and then dump
 

1595
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,850
could be lying right yeah and then dump
the stuff you know I try to manipulate

1596
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:13,860

00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:04,740
functioning properly but then you would
 

1753
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:06,110
functioning properly but then you would
probably if you wanted to keep them

1754
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:06,120
probably if you wanted to keep them
 

1755
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,870
probably if you wanted to keep them
functioning properly yeah then it would

1756
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:07,880
functioning properly yeah then it would
 

1757
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,889
functioning properly yeah then it would
rapidly like you would never experience

1758
00:30:09,889 --> 00:30:09,899
rapidly like you would never experience
 

1759
00:30:09,899 --> 00:30:11,450
rapidly like you would never experience
a time where you're like oh no that was

1760
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:11,460
a time where you're like oh no that was
 

1761
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,610
a time where you're like oh no that was
a mistake because as soon you like

1762
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:13,620
a mistake because as soon you like
 

1763
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:14,930
a mistake because as soon you like
before you even experience that the

1764
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:14,940
before you even experience that the
 

1765
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:17,510
before you even experience that the
world would shift to to match it oh

1766
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:17,520
world would shift to to match it oh
 

1767
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,130
world would shift to to match it oh
interesting now I think I would actually

1768
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:19,140
interesting now I think I would actually
 

1769
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:21,110
interesting now I think I would actually
I take it back I think I would regret

1770
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:21,120
I take it back I think I would regret
 

1771
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,110
I take it back I think I would regret
the first time I hurt somebody

1772
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:24,120
the first time I hurt somebody
 

1773
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,210
the first time I hurt somebody
see in my visualization was like a video

1774
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:26,220
see in my visualization was like a video
 

1775
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:28,370
see in my visualization was like a video
game where everybody's like NPC really

1776
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:28,380
game where everybody's like NPC really
 

1777
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:30,830
game where everybody's like NPC really
dumb no I think the first time I I

1778
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:30,840
dumb no I think the first time I I
 

1779
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,649
dumb no I think the first time I I
witnessed paying from anybody that's

1780
00:30:33,649 --> 00:30:33,659
witnessed paying from anybody that's
 

1781
00:30:33,659 --> 00:30:35,570
witnessed paying from anybody that's
when I would stop and I would probably

1782
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:35,580
when I would stop and I would probably
 

1783
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:38,210
when I would stop and I would probably
run into that very quickly

1784
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:38,220
run into that very quickly
 

1785
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:41,029
run into that very quickly
like even just the hovering make a

1786
00:30:41,029 --> 00:30:41,039
like even just the hovering make a
 

1787
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,590
like even just the hovering make a
person hover and they're gonna be

1788
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:42,600
person hover and they're gonna be
 

1789
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,330
person hover and they're gonna be
probably really upset with the hovering

1790
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:44,340
probably really upset with the hovering
 

1791
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:46,310
probably really upset with the hovering
right and so I'm gonna be like no don't

1792
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:46,320
right and so I'm gonna be like no don't
 

1793
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,590
right and so I'm gonna be like no don't
do that anymore and then I'll probably

1794
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:48,600
do that anymore and then I'll probably
 

1795
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,269
do that anymore and then I'll probably
go to honestly I'll just return back to

1796
00:30:50,269 --> 00:30:50,279
go to honestly I'll just return back to
 

1797
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:52,310
go to honestly I'll just return back to
my normal life

1798
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:52,320
my normal life
 

1799
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,590
my normal life
uh yeah that's kind of what I feel like

1800
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:54,600
uh yeah that's kind of what I feel like
 

1801
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,630
uh yeah that's kind of what I feel like
like if I had the power to do anything I

1802
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:56,640
like if I had the power to do anything I
 

1803
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,210
like if I had the power to do anything I
think I would probably want to have a

1804
00:30:59,210 --> 00:30:59,220
think I would probably want to have a
 

1805
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:02,389
think I would probably want to have a
life very similar to where I am now yeah

1806
00:31:02,389 --> 00:31:02,399
life very similar to where I am now yeah
 

1807
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,190
life very similar to where I am now yeah
yeah I mean there's it's like with Uber

1808
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:04,200
yeah I mean there's it's like with Uber
 

1809
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,990
yeah I mean there's it's like with Uber
like it'd be probably more convenient to

1810
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:06,000
like it'd be probably more convenient to
 

1811
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,610
like it'd be probably more convenient to
do certain things

1812
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:07,620
do certain things
 

1813
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,289
do certain things
but even then

1814
00:31:09,289 --> 00:31:09,299
but even then
 

1815
00:31:09,299 --> 00:31:11,269
but even then
like the struggle like I got a flat tire

1816
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:11,279
like the struggle like I got a flat tire
 

1817

so I have to fix that I kind of the flat
 

1819
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,590
so I have to fix that I kind of the flat
tire makes

1820
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:15,600
tire makes
 

1821
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,649
tire makes
makes everything more beautiful was that

1822
00:31:18,649 --> 00:31:18,659
makes everything more beautiful was that
 

1823
00:31:18,659 --> 00:31:20,930
makes everything more beautiful was that
cool I could do like a normal manual

1824
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:20,940
cool I could do like a normal manual
 

1825
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:21,950
cool I could do like a normal manual
thing

1826
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:21,960

transportation all of it I I know some
 

1835
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,490
transportation all of it I I know some
people who would like call this a bunch

1836
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:31,500
people who would like call this a bunch
 

1837
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,409
people who would like call this a bunch
of copium like you're just sort of

1838
00:31:33,409 --> 00:31:33,419
of copium like you're just sort of
 

1839
00:31:33,419 --> 00:31:35,029
of copium like you're just sort of
making do with what you have like we

1840
00:31:35,029 --> 00:31:35,039
making do with what you have like we
 

1841
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:37,909
making do with what you have like we
wouldn't go back to Amish times or like

1842
00:31:37,909 --> 00:31:37,919
wouldn't go back to Amish times or like
 

1843
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:40,250
wouldn't go back to Amish times or like
pre-technology because to like in order

1844
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:40,260
pre-technology because to like in order
 

1845
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:42,409
pre-technology because to like in order
to make ourselves appreciate things more

1846
00:31:42,409 --> 00:31:42,419
to make ourselves appreciate things more
 

1847
00:31:42,419 --> 00:31:44,029
to make ourselves appreciate things more
and so it seems like a hindsight

1848
00:31:44,029 --> 00:31:44,039
and so it seems like a hindsight
 

1849
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:46,850
and so it seems like a hindsight
reasoning uh which like I can appreciate

1850
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:46,860
reasoning uh which like I can appreciate
 

1851
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:49,490
reasoning uh which like I can appreciate
that argument but I don't know I'm like

1852
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:49,500
that argument but I don't know I'm like
 

1853
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,889
that argument but I don't know I'm like
anyone who uses sorry to interrupt the

1854
00:31:51,889 --> 00:31:51,899
anyone who uses sorry to interrupt the
 

1855
00:31:51,899 --> 00:31:54,049
anyone who uses sorry to interrupt the
word copium in their um in their

1856
00:31:54,049 --> 00:31:54,059
word copium in their um in their
 

1857
00:31:54,059 --> 00:31:55,370
word copium in their um in their
argumentation

1858
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:55,380
argumentation
 

1859
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:58,210
argumentation
um uh I think it's sauce

1860
00:31:58,210 --> 00:31:58,220
um uh I think it's sauce
 

1861
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:01,430
um uh I think it's sauce
yeah it's that's my entire argument is

1862
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:01,440
yeah it's that's my entire argument is
 

1863
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,010
yeah it's that's my entire argument is
now no I'm just kidding I'm sorry go

1864
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:04,020
now no I'm just kidding I'm sorry go
 

1865
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,169
now no I'm just kidding I'm sorry go
ahead sorry I interrupted rudely the

1866
00:32:06,169 --> 00:32:06,179
ahead sorry I interrupted rudely the
 

1867
00:32:06,179 --> 00:32:09,710
ahead sorry I interrupted rudely the
flow of thought uh but you you so you

1868
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:09,720
flow of thought uh but you you so you
 

1869
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,690
flow of thought uh but you you so you
don't think so in part you disagree with

1870
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:11,700
don't think so in part you disagree with
 

1871
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,070
don't think so in part you disagree with
that kind of argument

1872
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:13,080
that kind of argument
 

1873
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:13,750
that kind of argument
um

1874
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:13,760
um
 

1875
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,730
um
yeah because I I think people have this

1876
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:16,740
yeah because I I think people have this
 

1877
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:19,669
yeah because I I think people have this
idea that if you uh like come to accept

1878
00:32:19,669 --> 00:32:19,679
idea that if you uh like come to accept
 

1879
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,350
idea that if you uh like come to accept
or like Find meaning in what you have

1880
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:21,360
or like Find meaning in what you have
 

1881
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,210
or like Find meaning in what you have
now this is sort of at odds with trying

1882
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:23,220
now this is sort of at odds with trying
 

1883
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,649
now this is sort of at odds with trying
to improve it

1884
00:32:24,649 --> 00:32:24,659
to improve it
 

1885
00:32:24,659 --> 00:32:26,810
to improve it
and all right I don't find this to be

1886
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:26,820
and all right I don't find this to be
 

1887
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,010
and all right I don't find this to be
the case I find like the attempt to

1888
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:28,020
the case I find like the attempt to
 

1889
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:31,190
the case I find like the attempt to
improve it to also be part of it like I

1890
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:31,200
improve it to also be part of it like I
 

1891
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,570
improve it to also be part of it like I
enjoy the fact that there's something

1892
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:32,580
enjoy the fact that there's something
 

1893
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:34,850
enjoy the fact that there's something
like problematic going on because now I

1894
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:34,860
like problematic going on because now I
 

1895
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,769
like problematic going on because now I
get the experience of like striving to

1896
00:32:36,769 --> 00:32:36,779
get the experience of like striving to
 

1897
00:32:36,779 --> 00:32:38,990
get the experience of like striving to
make it go away and like that in itself

1898
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:39,000
make it go away and like that in itself
 

1899
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,430
make it go away and like that in itself
is where the meaning lies it's not just

1900
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:40,440
is where the meaning lies it's not just
 

1901
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,510
is where the meaning lies it's not just
that things are bad it's that there's

1902
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:41,520
that things are bad it's that there's
 

1903
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,830
that things are bad it's that there's
things are bad and we're trying to stop

1904
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:42,840
things are bad and we're trying to stop
 

1905
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:46,190
things are bad and we're trying to stop
it and also exactly there's if you

1906
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:46,200
it and also exactly there's if you
 

1907
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,750
it and also exactly there's if you

the amount of questions the answer
 

1939
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,289
the amount of questions the answer
successfully versus not like polls yeah

1940
00:33:24,289 --> 00:33:24,299
successfully versus not like polls yeah
 

1941
00:33:24,299 --> 00:33:26,090
successfully versus not like polls yeah

00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:38,720
so it's that that was I think the most
 

2199
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:43,849
so it's that that was I think the most
annoying part of the my upbringing

2200
00:37:43,849 --> 00:37:43,859

 

2201
00:37:43,859 --> 00:37:46,310

would you classify it as like suffering

2202
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:46,320
would you classify it as like suffering
 

2203
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,710
would you classify it as like suffering
at the time yeah definitely well it's

2204
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:48,720
at the time yeah definitely well it's
 

2205
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,569
at the time yeah definitely well it's
confusing because like when when I was a

2206
00:37:50,569 --> 00:37:50,579
confusing because like when when I was a
 

2207
00:37:50,579 --> 00:37:52,910
confusing because like when when I was a
child it was it was just painful in the

2208
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:52,920
child it was it was just painful in the
 

2209
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,589
child it was it was just painful in the
sense that like things suck but it was

2210
00:37:54,589 --> 00:37:54,599
sense that like things suck but it was
 

2211
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:56,450
sense that like things suck but it was
placed in a meaning framework right like

2212
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:56,460
placed in a meaning framework right like
 

2213
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:58,790
placed in a meaning framework right like
it is good it is virtuous to submit to

2214
00:37:58,790 --> 00:37:58,800
it is good it is virtuous to submit to

them again you go do that without

2222
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:04,200
them again you go do that without
 

2223
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,410
them again you go do that without
complaining and so like I would go do

2224
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:06,420
complaining and so like I would go do
 

2225
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:08,510
complaining and so like I would go do
something like that and I would like it

2226
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:08,520
something like that and I would like it
 

2227
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,730
something like that and I would like it
would suck it really was like concretely

2228
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:10,740
would suck it really was like concretely
 

2229
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,589
would suck it really was like concretely
painful but it was also placed in this

2230
00:38:12,589 --> 00:38:12,599
painful but it was also placed in this
 

2231
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:14,150
painful but it was also placed in this
narrative where I was like fulfilling

2232
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:14,160
narrative where I was like fulfilling
 

2233
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,670
narrative where I was like fulfilling
some sort of Greater purpose sure uh and

2234
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:16,680
some sort of Greater purpose sure uh and
 

2235
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:19,310
some sort of Greater purpose sure uh and
so so it's very confusing to refer to it

2236
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:19,320
so so it's very confusing to refer to it
 

2237
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,450
so so it's very confusing to refer to it
as suffering because there's so many

2238
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:20,460
as suffering because there's so many
 

2239
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:21,950
as suffering because there's so many
painful things we do today that are

2240
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:21,960
painful things we do today that are
 

2241
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,150
painful things we do today that are
placed in The Narrative of a greater

2242
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:23,160
placed in The Narrative of a greater
 

2243
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,829
placed in The Narrative of a greater
purpose that like I think I would agree

2244
00:38:24,829 --> 00:38:24,839
purpose that like I think I would agree
 

2245
00:38:24,839 --> 00:38:26,270
purpose that like I think I would agree
with like I go get a medical procedure

2246
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:26,280
with like I go get a medical procedure
 

2247
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,490
with like I go get a medical procedure

2248
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:28,500

helping me in the long run but like say

2250
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:30,720
helping me in the long run but like say
 

2251
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,329
helping me in the long run but like say
if I got abducted to an alien planet and

2252
00:38:32,329 --> 00:38:32,339
if I got abducted to an alien planet and
 

2253
00:38:32,339 --> 00:38:33,410
if I got abducted to an alien planet and
they're like by the way all of those

2254
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:33,420
they're like by the way all of those
 

2255
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:35,690
they're like by the way all of those
medical procedures you got done like you

2256
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:35,700
medical procedures you got done like you
 

2257
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,069
medical procedures you got done like you
didn't have to get them done those are

2258
00:38:37,069 --> 00:38:37,079
didn't have to get them done those are
 

2259
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:38,390
didn't have to get them done those are
totally unnecessary then I might get

2260
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:38,400
totally unnecessary then I might get
 

2261
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,770
totally unnecessary then I might get
really upset about it yeah I wouldn't

00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:39,780
really upset about it yeah I wouldn't
 

2263
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:41,270
really upset about it yeah I wouldn't
trust those aliens though because they

2264
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:41,280
trust those aliens though because they
 

2265
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,349
trust those aliens though because they
probably want to do different medical

it's genetic that you're able to notice

2332
00:39:58,490 --> 00:39:58,500
it's genetic that you're able to notice
 

2333

the beauty in the world and some of it
 

2335
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:03,470
the beauty in the world and some of it
is practiced where you realize focusing

2336
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:03,480
is practiced where you realize focusing
 

2337
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:06,829
is practiced where you realize focusing
on the negative things in life

2338
00:40:06,829 --> 00:40:06,839
on the negative things in life
 

2339
00:40:06,839 --> 00:40:10,730
on the negative things in life
like unproductively is uh

2340
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:10,740
like unproductively is uh
 

2341
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,770
like unproductively is uh
it's it just doesn't help your mind

flourish so like you just notice that
 

2345
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,010
flourish so like you just notice that
and it's like

2346
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:16,020
and it's like
 

2347
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,510
and it's like
I mean I think people with like

2348
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:17,520
I mean I think people with like
 

2349
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,089
I mean I think people with like
depression uh learn that or like

2350
00:40:20,089 --> 00:40:20,099
depression uh learn that or like
 

2351
00:40:20,099 --> 00:40:22,609
depression uh learn that or like
probably with trauma too is like there's

2352
00:40:22,609 --> 00:40:22,619
probably with trauma too is like there's
 

2353
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:24,710
probably with trauma too is like there's
certain triggers like if you're if you

2354
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:24,720
certain triggers like if you're if you
 

2355
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,870
certain triggers like if you're if you
suffer from depression you have to kind

2356
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:26,880
suffer from depression you have to kind
 

2357
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,130
suffer from depression you have to kind
of consciously know there's going to be

2358
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:28,140
of consciously know there's going to be
 

2359
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:30,349
of consciously know there's going to be
triggers that will expire like force you

2360
00:40:30,349 --> 00:40:30,359
triggers that will expire like force you
 

2361
00:40:30,359 --> 00:40:32,390
triggers that will expire like force you
to spiral down and so just avoid those

2362
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:32,400
to spiral down and so just avoid those
 

2363
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,829
to spiral down and so just avoid those
triggers some people have that with diet

2364
00:40:33,829 --> 00:40:33,839
triggers some people have that with diet
 

2365
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:36,170
triggers some people have that with diet
with food and so on and so I just don't

was not conscious at the time this was
my hindsight story but I believe that

my hindsight story but I believe that
 

2405
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:22,730
my hindsight story but I believe that
like being exposed to a culture in which

actually had the capacity to seriously
question my faith even though I thought

question my faith even though I thought
 

2459
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,950
question my faith even though I thought
that I was questioning it quite hard

2460
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:09,960
that I was questioning it quite hard
 

2461
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,170
that I was questioning it quite hard
until I got into an environment where it

2462
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:12,180
until I got into an environment where it
 

2463
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:14,150
until I got into an environment where it
was safe to do so and once I started

2464
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:14,160
was safe to do so and once I started
 

2465
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,589
was safe to do so and once I started
being able to make friends who were not

2466
00:42:15,589 --> 00:42:15,599
being able to make friends who were not
 

2467
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:17,569
being able to make friends who were not
religious I'm like oh if I lose my faith

2470
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:19,140
I'm still going to have some sort of
 

2471
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,510
I'm still going to have some sort of
community

2472
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:20,520
community
 

2473
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,310
community
um and then at that time I went through

2474
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:22,320
um and then at that time I went through
 

2475
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,630
um and then at that time I went through
some questioning and then I lost my

2476
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:23,640
some questioning and then I lost my
 

2477
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:24,770
some questioning and then I lost my
faith and

2478
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:24,780
faith and
 

2479
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:27,230
faith and
so in that given your friends giving you

2480
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:27,240
so in that given your friends giving you
 

2481
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,690
so in that given your friends giving you
a situation you have you you now have

2482
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:29,700
a situation you have you you now have
 

2483
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:32,390
a situation you have you you now have
the freedom to think essentially or at

2484
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:32,400
the freedom to think essentially or at
 

2485
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,710
the freedom to think essentially or at
least the ability to think of something

2486
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:33,720
least the ability to think of something
 

2487
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,210
least the ability to think of something
that was acceptable in the new culture

2488
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:35,220
that was acceptable in the new culture
 

2489
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,890
that was acceptable in the new culture
yeah

2490
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:36,900
yeah
 

2491
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:38,510
yeah
without

2492
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:38,520
without
 

2493
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,010
without
I mean is there a danger of like

2494
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:40,020
I mean is there a danger of like
 

2495
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:43,310
I mean is there a danger of like
adopting the beliefs of the new culture

2496
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:43,320
adopting the beliefs of the new culture
 

2497
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,530
adopting the beliefs of the new culture
so like there's some aspect of just

2498
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:45,540
so like there's some aspect of just
 

2499
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:48,109
so like there's some aspect of just
being able to think freely which you

2500
00:42:48,109 --> 00:42:48,119
being able to think freely which you
 

2501
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:49,430
being able to think freely which you
weren't able to do when you were growing

2502
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:49,440
weren't able to do when you were growing
 

2503
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,310
weren't able to do when you were growing
up just to think like look at the world

2504
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:52,320
up just to think like look at the world
 

2505
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,530
up just to think like look at the world
and wonder how it works that kind of

2506
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:54,540
and wonder how it works that kind of
 

2507
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:56,870
and wonder how it works that kind of
thing but I mean you rip it within

2508
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:56,880
thing but I mean you rip it within
 

2509
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,490
thing but I mean you rip it within
certain boundaries like there's certain

2510
00:42:58,490 --> 00:42:58,500
certain boundaries like there's certain
 

2511
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:59,750
certain boundaries like there's certain
basic assumptions

2512
00:42:59,750 --> 00:42:59,760
basic assumptions
 

2513
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,309
basic assumptions
and as long as you're following those

2514
00:43:01,309 --> 00:43:01,319
and as long as you're following those
 

2515
00:43:01,319 --> 00:43:03,470
and as long as you're following those
basic assumptions which is to be fair

2516
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:03,480
basic assumptions which is to be fair
 

2517
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,550
basic assumptions which is to be fair
it's like kind of what we're doing now

2518
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:04,560
it's like kind of what we're doing now
 

2519
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,890
it's like kind of what we're doing now
like we have I have I gone and done the

2520
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:06,900
like we have I have I gone and done the
 

2521
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:08,569
like we have I have I gone and done the
personal research that like evolution is

2522
00:43:08,569 --> 00:43:08,579
personal research that like evolution is
 

2523
00:43:08,579 --> 00:43:09,710
personal research that like evolution is
the thing that's going on have I looked

2524
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:09,720
the thing that's going on have I looked
 

2525
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,030
the thing that's going on have I looked
at like the age of the stones no I

2526
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:11,040
at like the age of the stones no I
 

2527

you're assuming a lot of things

2544
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:32,220

 

2545
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:33,589

I'm aware of the assumptions you're

2546
00:43:33,589 --> 00:43:33,599
I'm aware of the assumptions you're
 

2547
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:35,030
I'm aware of the assumptions you're
making like as opposed to not making

2548
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:35,040
making like as opposed to not making
 

2549
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,770
making like as opposed to not making
those assumptions at all like you have

2550
00:43:36,770 --> 00:43:36,780
those assumptions at all like you have
 

2551
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,990
those assumptions at all like you have
to assume something and I did it's very

2552
00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:39,000
to assume something and I did it's very
 

2553
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,670
to assume something and I did it's very
suspicious right that I went out of this

2554
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:40,680
suspicious right that I went out of this
 

2555
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,290
suspicious right that I went out of this
very conservative culture and now I well

2556
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:42,300
very conservative culture and now I well
 

2557
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:43,970
very conservative culture and now I well
I guess I don't believe things that are

2558
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:43,980
I guess I don't believe things that are
 

2559
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:45,650
I guess I don't believe things that are
super in line with the current culture I

2560
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:45,660
super in line with the current culture I

super in line with the current culture I
think this is why I feel a little bit

think this is why I feel a little bit
safer right now because like when I was

it seems like a great conversation more
emerges from it than the sum of its

2706
00:46:14,210 --> 00:46:14,220
emerges from it than the sum of its
 

2707
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:16,730
emerges from it than the sum of its
parts right like somehow two people

2708
00:46:16,730 --> 00:46:16,740
parts right like somehow two people
 

2709
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:18,349

00:46:18,349 --> 00:46:18,359
together can do
 

2711
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:20,210
together can do
like that dance of ideas can somehow

attention you have to understand the
 

2739
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:50,150
attention you have to understand the
mechanics of how two bodies move when

2740

it's a rapid puzzle and that's so

2762
00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:12,660
it's a rapid puzzle and that's so
 

2763

2771
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:20,210
background you can come and you just
kind of mix those together speaking

2772
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:20,220
kind of mix those together speaking
 

2773
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:21,530

about people like ballet with people

2774
00:47:21,530 --> 00:47:21,540
about people like ballet with people

doing ballroom with people doing Blues
 

2777
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,010
doing ballroom with people doing Blues
cool and then there's an interesting

2778
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:25,020
cool and then there's an interesting
 

2779
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:26,390
cool and then there's an interesting
dynamic because there's I don't know

2780
00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:26,400
dynamic because there's I don't know
 

2781
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:29,210
dynamic because there's I don't know
maybe you can correct me but there's uh

2782
00:47:29,210 --> 00:47:29,220
maybe you can correct me but there's uh
 

2783
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:31,309
maybe you can correct me but there's uh
that's very meta there's usually a lead

2784
00:47:31,309 --> 00:47:31,319
that's very meta there's usually a lead
 

2785
00:47:31,319 --> 00:47:32,809
that's very meta there's usually a lead
in the follow

2786
00:47:32,809 --> 00:47:32,819
in the follow
 

2787
00:47:32,819 --> 00:47:35,210
in the follow
I guess most dances have that yeah yeah

2788
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:35,220
I guess most dances have that yeah yeah
 

2789
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:37,490
I guess most dances have that yeah yeah
and so that but both have a different

2790
00:47:37,490 --> 00:47:37,500
and so that but both have a different
 

2791
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,170
and so that but both have a different
like you both have to be quite sensitive

2792
00:47:39,170 --> 00:47:39,180
like you both have to be quite sensitive
 

2793
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:41,089
like you both have to be quite sensitive
to the other human being but in a

2794
00:47:41,089 --> 00:47:41,099
to the other human being but in a
 

2795
00:47:41,099 --> 00:47:42,349
to the other human being but in a
different way

2796
00:47:42,349 --> 00:47:42,359
different way
 

2797
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:46,490
different way
yeah it's interesting yes so I like both

2798
00:47:46,490 --> 00:47:46,500
yeah it's interesting yes so I like both
 

2799
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:50,630
yeah it's interesting yes so I like both
that there is that definitive role

2800
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:50,640
that there is that definitive role
 

2801
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,550
that there is that definitive role
but also

2802
00:47:52,550 --> 00:47:52,560
but also
 

2803
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:55,010
but also
like it's not somehow that one is better

2804
00:47:55,010 --> 00:47:55,020
like it's not somehow that one is better
 

2805
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:56,510
like it's not somehow that one is better
than the other there's an interesting

2806
00:47:56,510 --> 00:47:56,520
than the other there's an interesting
 

2807
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:59,089
than the other there's an interesting
tension between the two yeah yeah it's

2808
00:47:59,089 --> 00:47:59,099
tension between the two yeah yeah it's
 

2809
00:47:59,099 --> 00:48:00,770
tension between the two yeah yeah it's
cool because it's like a basic rule set

2810
00:48:00,770 --> 00:48:00,780
cool because it's like a basic rule set
 

2811
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:03,170
cool because it's like a basic rule set
that allows for a ton of expression I've

2812
00:48:03,170 --> 00:48:03,180
that allows for a ton of expression I've
 

2813
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:04,490
that allows for a ton of expression I've
recently started to experience

2814
00:48:04,490 --> 00:48:04,500
recently started to experience
 

2815
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,410
recently started to experience
experiment with like reverse leading

2816
00:48:06,410 --> 00:48:06,420
experiment with like reverse leading
 

2817
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:08,630
experiment with like reverse leading
it's not like back leading it's like I

2818
00:48:08,630 --> 00:48:08,640
it's not like back leading it's like I
 

2819
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:13,089
it's not like back leading it's like I
don't know like sometimes I was like

2820
00:48:13,089 --> 00:48:13,099

 

2821
00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:15,890

what I'm typically following I'll like

2822
00:48:15,890 --> 00:48:15,900
what I'm typically following I'll like
 

2823
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:17,390
what I'm typically following I'll like
occasionally throw in a little lead here

2824
00:48:17,390 --> 00:48:17,400
occasionally throw in a little lead here
 

2825
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,309
occasionally throw in a little lead here
and there but don't but don't you kind

2826
00:48:19,309 --> 00:48:19,319
and there but don't but don't you kind
 

2827
00:48:19,319 --> 00:48:22,730
and there but don't but don't you kind
of always oh I see but don't you hit

2828
00:48:22,730 --> 00:48:22,740
of always oh I see but don't you hit
 

2829
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:24,470
of always oh I see but don't you hit
hint at

2830
00:48:24,470 --> 00:48:24,480
hint at
 

2831
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,569
hint at
a lead when you're following

2832
00:48:26,569 --> 00:48:26,579
a lead when you're following
 

2833
00:48:26,579 --> 00:48:28,670
a lead when you're following
I can't don't you just by the the

2834
00:48:28,670 --> 00:48:28,680
I can't don't you just by the the
 

2835
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:30,349
I can't don't you just by the the
Dynamics of your movement you're not

2836
00:48:30,349 --> 00:48:30,359
Dynamics of your movement you're not
 

2837
00:48:30,359 --> 00:48:32,450
Dynamics of your movement you're not
perfectly following I mean because there

2838
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:32,460
perfectly following I mean because there
 

2839
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:35,450
perfectly following I mean because there
is like the lead is listening to your

2840
00:48:35,450 --> 00:48:35,460
is like the lead is listening to your
 

2841
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:38,089
is like the lead is listening to your
body right yeah so like

2842
00:48:38,089 --> 00:48:38,099
body right yeah so like
 

2843
00:48:38,099 --> 00:48:40,730
body right yeah so like

00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:43,069
maybe it's the filter I see like did the
couple in the notebook also have sex

3460
00:58:43,069 --> 00:58:43,079
couple in the notebook also have sex
 

3461
00:58:43,079 --> 00:58:45,170
couple in the notebook also have sex
because maybe for romantic movies I

3462
00:58:45,170 --> 00:58:45,180
because maybe for romantic movies I
 

3463
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:47,630
because maybe for romantic movies I
focus on the romance

3464
00:58:47,630 --> 00:58:47,640
focus on the romance
 

3465
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:50,150
focus on the romance
maybe right and the sex scenes are

3466
00:58:50,150 --> 00:58:50,160
maybe right and the sex scenes are
 

3467
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:52,370
maybe right and the sex scenes are
always like weirdly filmed in these yeah

3468
00:58:52,370 --> 00:58:52,380
always like weirdly filmed in these yeah
 

3469
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:55,010
always like weirdly filmed in these yeah
because it's never I mean

3470
00:58:55,010 --> 00:58:55,020
because it's never I mean
 

3471
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:56,870
because it's never I mean
it doesn't it feels more like romance

3472
00:58:56,870 --> 00:58:56,880
it doesn't it feels more like romance
 

3473
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,190
it doesn't it feels more like romance
and sex

3474
00:58:58,190 --> 00:58:58,200
and sex
 

3475
00:58:58,200 --> 00:58:59,930
and sex
I guess that's the main focus of this

3476
00:58:59,930 --> 00:58:59,940
I guess that's the main focus of this
 

3477
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:02,329
I guess that's the main focus of this
right yeah yeah that makes sense yeah

3478
00:59:02,329 --> 00:59:02,339
right yeah yeah that makes sense yeah
 

3479
00:59:02,339 --> 00:59:04,430
right yeah yeah that makes sense yeah
anyway so they had sex it's good to know

3480
00:59:04,430 --> 00:59:04,440
anyway so they had sex it's good to know
 

3481
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:06,829
anyway so they had sex it's good to know
they did I'll go back and and watch you

3482
00:59:06,829 --> 00:59:06,839
they did I'll go back and and watch you
 

3483
00:59:06,839 --> 00:59:08,569
they did I'll go back and and watch you
have your own effects filter on your

3484
00:59:08,569 --> 00:59:08,579
have your own effects filter on your
 

3485
00:59:08,579 --> 00:59:10,490
have your own effects filter on your
brain and once you realize that there

3486
00:59:10,490 --> 00:59:10,500
brain and once you realize that there
 

3487
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:12,950
brain and once you realize that there
are some uh like the foundation of your

3488
00:59:12,950 --> 00:59:12,960
are some uh like the foundation of your
 

3489
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:13,970
are some uh like the foundation of your
beliefs

3490
00:59:13,970 --> 00:59:13,980
beliefs
 

3491
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:15,829
beliefs
were wrong then everything might be

3492
00:59:15,829 --> 00:59:15,839
were wrong then everything might be
 

3493
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:17,770
were wrong then everything might be
wrong and you're kind of just doing yeah

3494
00:59:17,770 --> 00:59:17,780
wrong and you're kind of just doing yeah
 

3495
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:20,030
wrong and you're kind of just doing yeah
principles basically and again like not

3496
00:59:20,030 --> 00:59:20,040
principles basically and again like not
 

3497
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:22,370
principles basically and again like not
totally separate from culture but also I

3498
00:59:22,370 --> 00:59:22,380
totally separate from culture but also I
 

3499
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:23,390
totally separate from culture but also I
think in general I also have a

3500
00:59:23,390 --> 00:59:23,400
think in general I also have a
 

3501
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:25,250
think in general I also have a
predisposition to just be like you know

3502
00:59:25,250 --> 00:59:25,260
predisposition to just be like you know
 

3503
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:26,870
predisposition to just be like you know
[\h__\h] what culture tells you just figure

3504
00:59:26,870 --> 00:59:26,880
[\h__\h] what culture tells you just figure
 

3505
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:28,970
[\h__\h] what culture tells you just figure
out what's right for you and do it and

3506
00:59:28,970 --> 00:59:28,980
out what's right for you and do it and
 

3507
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:31,010
out what's right for you and do it and
so that mixed with you know the figuring

3508
00:59:31,010 --> 00:59:31,020
so that mixed with you know the figuring
 

3509
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:32,150
so that mixed with you know the figuring
things out from first principles I did

3510
00:59:32,150 --> 00:59:32,160
things out from first principles I did
 

3511
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:33,950
things out from first principles I did
eventually figure out that I didn't like

3512
00:59:33,950 --> 00:59:33,960
eventually figure out that I didn't like
 

3513
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:36,049
eventually figure out that I didn't like
having casual sex with just anybody

3514
00:59:36,049 --> 00:59:36,059
having casual sex with just anybody
 

3515
00:59:36,059 --> 00:59:38,150
having casual sex with just anybody
quite as much so I stopped that but it

3516
00:59:38,150 --> 00:59:38,160
quite as much so I stopped that but it
 

3517
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:39,109
quite as much so I stopped that but it
took me a while to figure that out

3518
00:59:39,109 --> 00:59:39,119
took me a while to figure that out
 

3519
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:40,970
took me a while to figure that out
what's the negative of casual sex it's

3520
00:59:40,970 --> 00:59:40,980
what's the negative of casual sex it's
 

3521

what's the negative of casual sex it's
just like not good I mean the

00:59:43,849 --> 00:59:43,859
just like not good I mean the
 

3523
00:59:43,859 --> 00:59:45,349
just like not good I mean the
you're at the chemistry you have with

3524
00:59:45,349 --> 00:59:45,359
you're at the chemistry you have with
 

3525
00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:46,849
you're at the chemistry you have with
someone better then then it can be a lot

3526
00:59:46,849 --> 00:59:46,859
someone better then then it can be a lot
 

3527
00:59:46,859 --> 00:59:48,770
someone better then then it can be a lot
nicer but I wasn't doing that I was just

3528
00:59:48,770 --> 00:59:48,780
nicer but I wasn't doing that I was just
 

3529
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:50,930
nicer but I wasn't doing that I was just
like somebody I met and I'm like you

3534
00:59:55,789 --> 00:59:55,799
bother to try and develop just any
 

3535
00:59:55,799 --> 00:59:57,170
bother to try and develop just any
chemistry I mean I didn't chemistry even

3536
00:59:57,170 --> 00:59:57,180
chemistry I mean I didn't chemistry even
 

3537
00:59:57,180 --> 00:59:58,730
chemistry I mean I didn't chemistry even
outside of sex just chemistry like human

3538
00:59:58,730 --> 00:59:58,740
outside of sex just chemistry like human
 

3539
00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:01,970
outside of sex just chemistry like human
chemistry conversation yeah okay I would

3540
01:00:01,970 --> 01:00:01,980

for my sort of outside of perspective
 

3793
01:04:13,319 --> 01:04:14,750
for my sort of outside of perspective
that seems to be still the case like

3794
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:14,760
that seems to be still the case like
 

3795

uh but yes I think you have that engine
 

3843
01:05:00,119 --> 01:05:02,270
uh but yes I think you have that engine
in your head I guess of creativity like

3844
01:05:02,270 --> 01:05:02,280
in your head I guess of creativity like
 

3845
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:03,950
in your head I guess of creativity like
yeah the way you ask questions which is

3846
01:05:03,950 --> 01:05:03,960
yeah the way you ask questions which is

01:05:29,510 --> 01:05:29,520
where they don't misinterpret the
 

3871
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:32,089
where they don't misinterpret the
question because it's amazing how you

3872
01:05:32,089 --> 01:05:32,099
question because it's amazing how you
 

3873
01:05:32,099 --> 01:05:33,349
question because it's amazing how you
any question you think oh this is the

3874
01:05:33,349 --> 01:05:33,359
any question you think oh this is the
 

3875
01:05:33,359 --> 01:05:34,789
any question you think oh this is the
clearest question possible no you're

3876
01:05:34,789 --> 01:05:34,799
clearest question possible no you're
 

3877
01:05:34,799 --> 01:05:36,890
clearest question possible no you're
wrong it has to be even clearer right

3878
01:05:36,890 --> 01:05:36,900
wrong it has to be even clearer right
 

3879
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:38,569
wrong it has to be even clearer right
willingly or unwillingly because like

3880
01:05:38,569 --> 01:05:38,579
willingly or unwillingly because like
 

3881
01:05:38,579 --> 01:05:40,549
willingly or unwillingly because like
you also have to defend against that

3882
01:05:40,549 --> 01:05:40,559
you also have to defend against that
 

3883
01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:42,109
you also have to defend against that
question being criticized later when you

3884
01:05:42,109 --> 01:05:42,119
question being criticized later when you
 

3885
01:05:42,119 --> 01:05:43,970
question being criticized later when you
publish about it all that you have to

3886
01:05:43,970 --> 01:05:43,980
publish about it all that you have to
 

3887
01:05:43,980 --> 01:05:45,349
publish about it all that you have to
think about it all I think this might be

3888
01:05:45,349 --> 01:05:45,359
think about it all I think this might be
 

3889
01:05:45,359 --> 01:05:46,430
think about it all I think this might be
my greatest strength so I'm not very

3890
01:05:46,430 --> 01:05:46,440
my greatest strength so I'm not very
 

3891
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:47,930
my greatest strength so I'm not very
good at statistics I'm not like great at

3892
01:05:47,930 --> 01:05:47,940
good at statistics I'm not like great at
 

3893
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:49,549
good at statistics I'm not like great at
presenting data but I think probably my

3894
01:05:49,549 --> 01:05:49,559
presenting data but I think probably my
 

3895
01:05:49,559 --> 01:05:50,990
presenting data but I think probably my
greatest strength is in fact survey

3896
01:05:50,990 --> 01:05:51,000
greatest strength is in fact survey
 

3897
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,549
greatest strength is in fact survey
design and like a question phrasing

3898
01:05:52,549 --> 01:05:52,559
design and like a question phrasing
 

3899
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:55,309
design and like a question phrasing
because I've I've I have treated so many

3900
01:05:55,309 --> 01:05:55,319
because I've I've I have treated so many
 

3901
01:05:55,319 --> 01:05:57,289
because I've I've I have treated so many
thousands of polls and every single one

3902
01:05:57,289 --> 01:05:57,299
thousands of polls and every single one
 

3903
01:05:57,299 --> 01:05:58,670
thousands of polls and every single one
I get people telling me like the way

3904
01:05:58,670 --> 01:05:58,680
I get people telling me like the way
 

3905
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:00,349
I get people telling me like the way
that they misinterpreted the poll so

3906
01:06:00,349 --> 01:06:00,359
that they misinterpreted the poll so
 

3907
01:06:00,359 --> 01:06:01,789
that they misinterpreted the poll so
it's like it's like you've become gone

3908
01:06:01,789 --> 01:06:01,799
it's like it's like you've become gone
 

3909
01:06:01,799 --> 01:06:04,549
it's like it's like you've become gone
through fire and then again I I'm

3910
01:06:04,549 --> 01:06:04,559
through fire and then again I I'm
 

3911
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:05,870
through fire and then again I I'm
testing the phrasings all the time like

3912
01:06:05,870 --> 01:06:05,880
testing the phrasings all the time like
 

3913
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:07,069
testing the phrasings all the time like
what happens if you slightly shift

3914
01:06:07,069 --> 01:06:07,079
what happens if you slightly shift
 

3915
01:06:07,079 --> 01:06:08,329
what happens if you slightly shift
phrasings and so I'll do the same

3916
01:06:08,329 --> 01:06:08,339
phrasings and so I'll do the same
 

3917
01:06:08,339 --> 01:06:10,370
phrasings and so I'll do the same
question test over time to see how it

3918

the site that I was on the way that it

3934
01:06:27,529 --> 01:06:27,539
the site that I was on the way that it
 

3935
01:06:27,539 --> 01:06:28,910
the site that I was on the way that it
structured is that you're ranking on the

3936
01:06:28,910 --> 01:06:28,920
structured is that you're ranking on the

01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:42,890
into like a warehouse and then they have
set up a little like things that

4074
01:08:42,890 --> 01:08:42,900
set up a little like things that
 

4075
01:08:42,900 --> 01:08:44,510
set up a little like things that
replicate bedrooms yeah but they're just

4076
01:08:44,510 --> 01:08:44,520
replicate bedrooms yeah but they're just
 

4077
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:45,950
replicate bedrooms yeah but they're just
like stalls

4078
01:08:45,950 --> 01:08:45,960
like stalls
 

4079
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:47,689
like stalls
and then you give you rent out or you

4080
01:08:47,689 --> 01:08:47,699
and then you give you rent out or you
 

4081
01:08:47,699 --> 01:08:49,669
and then you give you rent out or you
pay the studio percentage of your income

4082
01:08:49,669 --> 01:08:49,679
pay the studio percentage of your income
 

4083
01:08:49,679 --> 01:08:51,110
pay the studio percentage of your income
and you can tell when something looks

4084
01:08:51,110 --> 01:08:51,120
and you can tell when something looks
 

4085
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:52,189
and you can tell when something looks
like a studio it's like a type of

4086
01:08:52,189 --> 01:08:52,199
like a studio it's like a type of
 

4087
01:08:52,199 --> 01:08:53,510
like a studio it's like a type of
background yeah that if you're like

4088
01:08:53,510 --> 01:08:53,520
background yeah that if you're like
 

4089
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:55,309
background yeah that if you're like
watching enough it kind of starts to you

4090
01:08:55,309 --> 01:08:55,319
watching enough it kind of starts to you
 

4091
01:08:55,319 --> 01:08:57,410
watching enough it kind of starts to you
notice the patterns so like the

4092
01:08:57,410 --> 01:08:57,420
notice the patterns so like the
 

4093
01:08:57,420 --> 01:08:59,630
notice the patterns so like the
standards are lower there in the ethical

4094
01:08:59,630 --> 01:08:59,640
standards are lower there in the ethical
 

4095
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:02,450
standards are lower there in the ethical
boundaries are a little looser yeah I

4096
01:09:02,450 --> 01:09:02,460
boundaries are a little looser yeah I
 

4097
01:09:02,460 --> 01:09:03,890
boundaries are a little looser yeah I
thought people are treated it's Uncle we

4098
01:09:03,890 --> 01:09:03,900
thought people are treated it's Uncle we
 

4099
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:05,150
thought people are treated it's Uncle we
didn't I never heard anything about the

4100
01:09:05,150 --> 01:09:05,160
didn't I never heard anything about the
 

4101
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:07,189
didn't I never heard anything about the
ethical site I just knew that it was

4102
01:09:07,189 --> 01:09:07,199
ethical site I just knew that it was
 

4103
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:09,650
ethical site I just knew that it was
like lower quality like the girls seemed

4104
01:09:09,650 --> 01:09:09,660
like lower quality like the girls seemed
 

4105
01:09:09,660 --> 01:09:11,930
like lower quality like the girls seemed
like they were less into it and like

4106
01:09:11,930 --> 01:09:11,940
like they were less into it and like
 

4107
01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:13,910
like they were less into it and like
Carriage less how does this all

4108
01:09:13,910 --> 01:09:13,920
Carriage less how does this all
 

4109
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:16,189
Carriage less how does this all
interplay with like sex trafficking so

4110
01:09:16,189 --> 01:09:16,199
interplay with like sex trafficking so
 

4111
01:09:16,199 --> 01:09:18,110
interplay with like sex trafficking so
consensual versus non-consensual I would

4112
01:09:18,110 --> 01:09:18,120
consensual versus non-consensual I would
 

4113
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:20,150
consensual versus non-consensual I would
be strong ER never any non-consensual

4114
01:09:20,150 --> 01:09:20,160
be strong ER never any non-consensual
 

4115
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:22,309
be strong ER never any non-consensual
camming

4116
01:09:22,309 --> 01:09:22,319
camming
 

4117
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:23,450
camming
um I mean I guess it's like if it were

4118
01:09:23,450 --> 01:09:23,460
um I mean I guess it's like if it were
 

4119
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:24,530
um I mean I guess it's like if it were
going to happen to that point be

4120
01:09:24,530 --> 01:09:24,540
going to happen to that point be
 

4121
01:09:24,540 --> 01:09:25,789
going to happen to that point be
surprised if it were in fact Eastern

4122
01:09:25,789 --> 01:09:25,799
surprised if it were in fact Eastern
 

4123
01:09:25,799 --> 01:09:27,289
surprised if it were in fact Eastern
European models based on this is

4124
01:09:27,289 --> 01:09:27,299
European models based on this is
 

4125
01:09:27,299 --> 01:09:28,789
European models based on this is
outdated this is I'm just thinking of my

4126
01:09:28,789 --> 01:09:28,799
outdated this is I'm just thinking of my
 

4127
01:09:28,799 --> 01:09:30,229
outdated this is I'm just thinking of my
stereotypes back what I cammed a lot

4128
01:09:30,229 --> 01:09:30,239
stereotypes back what I cammed a lot
 

4129
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:31,849
stereotypes back what I cammed a lot
sure so some of that is stereotyped

4130
01:09:31,849 --> 01:09:31,859
sure so some of that is stereotyped
 

4131
01:09:31,859 --> 01:09:33,289
sure so some of that is stereotyped
versus like collecting good data right

4132
01:09:33,289 --> 01:09:33,299
versus like collecting good data right
 

4133
01:09:33,299 --> 01:09:35,749
versus like collecting good data right
yeah I haven't done data on cam girl

4134
01:09:35,749 --> 01:09:35,759
yeah I haven't done data on cam girl
 

4135
01:09:35,759 --> 01:09:38,030
yeah I haven't done data on cam girl
it's hard I mean it's hard it's even

4136
01:09:38,030 --> 01:09:38,040
it's hard I mean it's hard it's even
 

4137
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:40,669
it's hard I mean it's hard it's even
hard to get that data right

4138
01:09:40,669 --> 01:09:40,679
hard to get that data right
 

4139
01:09:40,679 --> 01:09:42,530
hard to get that data right
um yeah and obviously a really important

4140
01:09:42,530 --> 01:09:42,540
um yeah and obviously a really important
 

4141
01:09:42,540 --> 01:09:43,849
um yeah and obviously a really important
problem there's a method that I'm trying

4142
01:09:43,849 --> 01:09:43,859
problem there's a method that I'm trying
 

4143
01:09:43,859 --> 01:09:45,890
problem there's a method that I'm trying
that I really like I designed a survey

4144
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:45,900
that I really like I designed a survey
 

4145
01:09:45,900 --> 01:09:47,269
that I really like I designed a survey
type which is like asking people who you

4146
01:09:47,269 --> 01:09:47,279
type which is like asking people who you
 

4147
01:09:47,279 --> 01:09:49,189
type which is like asking people who you
know yeah like who do you who do you

4148
01:09:49,189 --> 01:09:49,199
know yeah like who do you who do you
 

4149
01:09:49,199 --> 01:09:50,329
know yeah like who do you who do you
know who's done this and you tell me

4150
01:09:50,329 --> 01:09:50,339
know who's done this and you tell me
 

4151
01:09:50,339 --> 01:09:51,349
know who's done this and you tell me
like oh do you know anybody who's a

4152
01:09:51,349 --> 01:09:51,359
like oh do you know anybody who's a
 

4153
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:52,610
like oh do you know anybody who's a
doctor do you know anybody who you know

4154
01:09:52,610 --> 01:09:52,620
doctor do you know anybody who you know
 

4155
01:09:52,620 --> 01:09:54,590
doctor do you know anybody who you know
has had cancer or like smokes or

4156
01:09:54,590 --> 01:09:54,600
has had cancer or like smokes or
 

4157
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:56,570
has had cancer or like smokes or
personally I mean yeah personally just

4158
01:09:56,570 --> 01:09:56,580
personally I mean yeah personally just
 

4159
01:09:56,580 --> 01:09:58,490
personally I mean yeah personally just
do you know anybody yeah um and then if

4160
01:09:58,490 --> 01:09:58,500
do you know anybody yeah um and then if
 

4161
01:09:58,500 --> 01:09:59,870
do you know anybody yeah um and then if
you ask about a whole bunch of things

4162
01:09:59,870 --> 01:09:59,880
you ask about a whole bunch of things
 

4163
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:03,290
you ask about a whole bunch of things
you can calibrate the responses so like

4164
01:10:03,290 --> 01:10:03,300
you can calibrate the responses so like
 

4165
01:10:03,300 --> 01:10:04,430
you can calibrate the responses so like
that's really interesting if you're if

4166
01:10:04,430 --> 01:10:04,440
that's really interesting if you're if
 

4167
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:06,110
that's really interesting if you're if
your population you know 20 of them know

4168
01:10:06,110 --> 01:10:06,120
your population you know 20 of them know
 

4169
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:07,310
your population you know 20 of them know
doctors and then you know the actual

4170
01:10:07,310 --> 01:10:07,320
doctors and then you know the actual
 

4171
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:09,290
doctors and then you know the actual
amount of doctors then you can tell like

4172
01:10:09,290 --> 01:10:09,300
amount of doctors then you can tell like
 

4173
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:10,729
amount of doctors then you can tell like
how this is corresponding like what is

4174
01:10:10,729 --> 01:10:10,739
how this is corresponding like what is
 

4175
01:10:10,739 --> 01:10:12,169
how this is corresponding like what is
the visibility of doctors so you can

4176
01:10:12,169 --> 01:10:12,179
the visibility of doctors so you can
 

4177
01:10:12,179 --> 01:10:14,450
the visibility of doctors so you can
reconstruct the graph basically yeah and

4178
01:10:14,450 --> 01:10:14,460
reconstruct the graph basically yeah and
 

4179
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:15,650
reconstruct the graph basically yeah and
and we can do this with sex trafficking

4180
01:10:15,650 --> 01:10:15,660
and we can do this with sex trafficking
 

4181
01:10:15,660 --> 01:10:16,430
and we can do this with sex trafficking
and of course people are going to be

4182
01:10:16,430 --> 01:10:16,440
and of course people are going to be
 

4183
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:17,689
and of course people are going to be
like well sex traffic is not visible

4184
01:10:17,689 --> 01:10:17,699
like well sex traffic is not visible
 

4185
01:10:17,699 --> 01:10:19,250
like well sex traffic is not visible
people you don't know those I'm like

4186
01:10:19,250 --> 01:10:19,260
people you don't know those I'm like
 

4187
01:10:19,260 --> 01:10:20,390
people you don't know those I'm like
well then we can ask about other

4188
01:10:20,390 --> 01:10:20,400
well then we can ask about other
 

4189
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:21,590
well then we can ask about other
non-visible things that other people

4190
01:10:21,590 --> 01:10:21,600
non-visible things that other people
 

4191
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:23,810
non-visible things that other people
don't know that we do have data for like

4192
01:10:23,810 --> 01:10:23,820
don't know that we do have data for like
 

4193
01:10:23,820 --> 01:10:26,270
don't know that we do have data for like
homelessness or being in jail or like uh

4194
01:10:26,270 --> 01:10:26,280
homelessness or being in jail or like uh
 

4195
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:27,649
homelessness or being in jail or like uh
if you have been like sexually assaulted

4196
01:10:27,649 --> 01:10:27,659
if you have been like sexually assaulted
 

4197
01:10:27,659 --> 01:10:28,790
if you have been like sexually assaulted
a lot of people don't like talking about

4198
01:10:28,790 --> 01:10:28,800
a lot of people don't like talking about
 

4199
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:30,350
a lot of people don't like talking about
if they've been sexually assaulted so

4200
01:10:30,350 --> 01:10:30,360
if they've been sexually assaulted so
 

4201
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:31,790
if they've been sexually assaulted so
you can do a whole bunch of things that

4202
01:10:31,790 --> 01:10:31,800
you can do a whole bunch of things that
 

4203
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:33,649
you can do a whole bunch of things that
are like similarly suppressed in

4204
01:10:33,649 --> 01:10:33,659
are like similarly suppressed in
 

4205
01:10:33,659 --> 01:10:35,090
are like similarly suppressed in
knowledge in some way that we do

4206
01:10:35,090 --> 01:10:35,100
knowledge in some way that we do
 

4207
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:37,370
knowledge in some way that we do
actually have rates for and then compare

4208
01:10:37,370 --> 01:10:37,380
actually have rates for and then compare
 

4209
01:10:37,380 --> 01:10:38,990
actually have rates for and then compare
that to the graph when we ask people do

4210
01:10:38,990 --> 01:10:39,000
that to the graph when we ask people do
 

4211
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,490
that to the graph when we ask people do
you know anybody who's in sex trafficked

4212
01:10:40,490 --> 01:10:40,500
you know anybody who's in sex trafficked
 

4213
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:42,530
you know anybody who's in sex trafficked
yeah so again this is not perfect I'm

4214
01:10:42,530 --> 01:10:42,540
yeah so again this is not perfect I'm
 

4215
01:10:42,540 --> 01:10:45,950
yeah so again this is not perfect I'm
not saying this is for things you can

4216
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:45,960
not saying this is for things you can
 

4217
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:48,470
not saying this is for things you can
infer things about that graph but let's

4218
01:10:48,470 --> 01:10:48,480
infer things about that graph but let's
 

4219
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:50,149
infer things about that graph but let's
say we don't have good ways of measuring

4220
01:10:50,149 --> 01:10:50,159
say we don't have good ways of measuring
 

4221
01:10:50,159 --> 01:10:51,950
say we don't have good ways of measuring
sex trafficking right now anyway I did a

4222
01:10:51,950 --> 01:10:51,960
sex trafficking right now anyway I did a
 

4223
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:53,270
sex trafficking right now anyway I did a
big deep dive into the research that we

4224
01:10:53,270 --> 01:10:53,280
big deep dive into the research that we
 

4225
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:54,530
big deep dive into the research that we
have and sex trafficking in the western

4226
01:10:54,530 --> 01:10:54,540
have and sex trafficking in the western
 

4227

studies and it's really pitiful we have
 

4233
01:11:00,780 --> 01:11:03,229
studies and it's really pitiful we have
terrible data it's like there's just

4234
01:11:03,229 --> 01:11:03,239
terrible data it's like there's just
 

4235
01:11:03,239 --> 01:11:05,270
terrible data it's like there's just
like vague estimations made from one guy

4236
01:11:05,270 --> 01:11:05,280
like vague estimations made from one guy
 

4237
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:07,370
like vague estimations made from one guy
in a basement in the 80s that's like the

4238
01:11:07,370 --> 01:11:07,380
in a basement in the 80s that's like the
 

4239
01:11:07,380 --> 01:11:09,350
in a basement in the 80s that's like the
basis for like one big study that like a

4240
01:11:09,350 --> 01:11:09,360
basis for like one big study that like a
 

4241
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:11,870
basis for like one big study that like a
lot of people report on it was and so

4242
01:11:11,870 --> 01:11:11,880
lot of people report on it was and so
 

4243
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:13,669
lot of people report on it was and so
I'm like okay so the the method I'm

4244
01:11:13,669 --> 01:11:13,679
I'm like okay so the the method I'm
 

4245
01:11:13,679 --> 01:11:15,649
I'm like okay so the the method I'm
proposing obviously is not perfect but

4246
01:11:15,649 --> 01:11:15,659
proposing obviously is not perfect but
 

4247
01:11:15,659 --> 01:11:17,630
proposing obviously is not perfect but
like the bar is so low at this point

4248
01:11:17,630 --> 01:11:17,640
like the bar is so low at this point
 

4249
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:20,390
like the bar is so low at this point
well I wonder also if there's a ways to

4250
01:11:20,390 --> 01:11:20,400
well I wonder also if there's a ways to
 

4251
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:23,510
well I wonder also if there's a ways to
design a survey that gets at the um at

4252
01:11:23,510 --> 01:11:23,520
design a survey that gets at the um at
 

4253
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:25,970
design a survey that gets at the um at
the victims of sex trafficking also

4254
01:11:25,970 --> 01:11:25,980
the victims of sex trafficking also
 

4255
01:11:25,980 --> 01:11:28,610
the victims of sex trafficking also
which is they presumably have public

4256
01:11:28,610 --> 01:11:28,620
which is they presumably have public
 

4257
01:11:28,620 --> 01:11:32,270
which is they presumably have public
access to the internet and

4258
01:11:32,270 --> 01:11:32,280
access to the internet and
 

4259
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:34,729
access to the internet and
I wonder how many of them are distinctly

4260
01:11:34,729 --> 01:11:34,739
I wonder how many of them are distinctly
 

4261
01:11:34,739 --> 01:11:37,729
I wonder how many of them are distinctly
aware that they're victims like it's

4262
01:11:37,729 --> 01:11:37,739
aware that they're victims like it's
 

4263
01:11:37,739 --> 01:11:39,350
aware that they're victims like it's
asking the question

4264
01:11:39,350 --> 01:11:39,360
asking the question
 

4265
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:40,850
asking the question
when you're inside of a toxic

4266
01:11:40,850 --> 01:11:40,860
when you're inside of a toxic
 

4267
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:42,709

4277
01:11:51,719 --> 01:11:53,930
you're not you don't even know what's
true yeah so it's interesting if you can

4278
01:11:53,930 --> 01:11:53,940
true yeah so it's interesting if you can
 

4279
01:11:53,940 --> 01:11:56,450
true yeah so it's interesting if you can
design surveys actively sex drive yeah

4280
01:11:56,450 --> 01:11:56,460
design surveys actively sex drive yeah
 

4281
01:11:56,460 --> 01:11:58,729
design surveys actively sex drive yeah
who could break through that so

4282
01:11:58,729 --> 01:11:58,739
who could break through that so
 

4283
01:11:58,739 --> 01:12:01,310
who could break through that so
basically get data on how many people

4284
01:12:01,310 --> 01:12:01,320
basically get data on how many people
 

4285
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:03,830
basically get data on how many people
are getting sex trafficked directly oh

4286
01:12:03,830 --> 01:12:03,840
are getting sex trafficked directly oh
 

4287
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:05,390
are getting sex trafficked directly oh
yeah like if you don't frame it like if

4288
01:12:05,390 --> 01:12:05,400
yeah like if you don't frame it like if
 

4289
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:06,590
yeah like if you don't frame it like if
you don't say the word sex trafficking

4290
01:12:06,590 --> 01:12:06,600

4293
01:12:07,860 --> 01:12:10,370
you're like are you just in a situation
where you'd and maybe through the survey

4294
01:12:10,370 --> 01:12:10,380
where you'd and maybe through the survey
 

4295
01:12:10,380 --> 01:12:12,110
where you'd and maybe through the survey
I mean that's very meta but through the

4296
01:12:12,110 --> 01:12:12,120
I mean that's very meta but through the
 

4297
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:14,209
I mean that's very meta but through the
survey help them you know I did this

4298
01:12:14,209 --> 01:12:14,219
survey help them you know I did this
 

4299
01:12:14,219 --> 01:12:15,770
survey help them you know I did this
this is what started my relationship

4300
01:12:15,770 --> 01:12:15,780
this is what started my relationship
 

4301
01:12:15,780 --> 01:12:17,090
this is what started my relationship
surveys so I've done a series of

4302
01:12:17,090 --> 01:12:17,100
surveys so I've done a series of
 

4303
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:18,290
surveys so I've done a series of
relationship surveys and that was

4304
01:12:18,290 --> 01:12:18,300
relationship surveys and that was
 

4305
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:19,430
relationship surveys and that was
because I knew somebody in a terrible

4306
01:12:19,430 --> 01:12:19,440
because I knew somebody in a terrible
 

4307
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:21,350
because I knew somebody in a terrible
relationship and I was like I bet if she

4308
01:12:21,350 --> 01:12:21,360
relationship and I was like I bet if she
 

4309
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:22,729
relationship and I was like I bet if she
took a survey where she answered

4310
01:12:22,729 --> 01:12:22,739
took a survey where she answered
 

4311
01:12:22,739 --> 01:12:23,870
took a survey where she answered
questions about her relationship and at

4312
01:12:23,870 --> 01:12:23,880
questions about her relationship and at
 

4313
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:25,370
questions about her relationship and at
the end got a score that compared her to

4314
01:12:25,370 --> 01:12:25,380
the end got a score that compared her to
 

4315
01:12:25,380 --> 01:12:27,169
the end got a score that compared her to
everybody else she'd be like oh wait

4316
01:12:27,169 --> 01:12:27,179
everybody else she'd be like oh wait
 

4317
01:12:27,179 --> 01:12:28,729
everybody else she'd be like oh wait
everybody else has much better

4318
01:12:28,729 --> 01:12:28,739
everybody else has much better
 

4319
01:12:28,739 --> 01:12:30,709
everybody else has much better
relationships than I do so that's why I

4320
01:12:30,709 --> 01:12:30,719
relationships than I do so that's why I
 

4321
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:32,090
relationships than I do so that's why I
started making the relationship surveys

4322
01:12:32,090 --> 01:12:32,100
started making the relationship surveys
 

4323
01:12:32,100 --> 01:12:33,770
started making the relationship surveys
was exactly for that reason yeah that's

4324
01:12:33,770 --> 01:12:33,780
was exactly for that reason yeah that's
 

4325
01:12:33,780 --> 01:12:35,689
was exactly for that reason yeah that's
really really powerful to know that like

4326
01:12:35,689 --> 01:12:35,699
really really powerful to know that like
 

4327
01:12:35,699 --> 01:12:37,370
really really powerful to know that like
you're not

4328
01:12:37,370 --> 01:12:37,380
you're not
 

4329
01:12:37,380 --> 01:12:39,770
you're not
you're not crazy for thinking this is a

4330
01:12:39,770 --> 01:12:39,780
you're not crazy for thinking this is a
 

4331
01:12:39,780 --> 01:12:42,169
you're not crazy for thinking this is a
bad relationship right or I think like

4332
01:12:42,169 --> 01:12:42,179
bad relationship right or I think like
 

4333
01:12:42,179 --> 01:12:43,850
bad relationship right or I think like
the actual question is like could you do

4334
01:12:43,850 --> 01:12:43,860
the actual question is like could you do
 

4335
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:46,490
the actual question is like could you do
better if you broke up I think that the

4336
01:12:46,490 --> 01:12:46,500
better if you broke up I think that the
 

4337
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:47,510
better if you broke up I think that the
thing that keeps most people in their

4338
01:12:47,510 --> 01:12:47,520
thing that keeps most people in their
 

4339
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:48,649
thing that keeps most people in their
relationships is like this is the best

4340
01:12:48,649 --> 01:12:48,659
relationships is like this is the best
 

4341
01:12:48,659 --> 01:12:50,990
relationships is like this is the best
that I can do like this is normal and if

4342
01:12:50,990 --> 01:12:51,000
that I can do like this is normal and if
 

4343
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,790
that I can do like this is normal and if
if it were normal I would say that they

4344
01:12:52,790 --> 01:12:52,800
if it were normal I would say that they
 

4345
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:54,050
if it were normal I would say that they
are right like if you live in a culture

4346
01:12:54,050 --> 01:12:54,060
are right like if you live in a culture
 

4347
01:12:54,060 --> 01:12:56,450
are right like if you live in a culture
where everybody is abusing there there

4348
01:12:56,450 --> 01:12:56,460
where everybody is abusing there there
 

4349
01:12:56,460 --> 01:12:57,890
where everybody is abusing there there
are people in the relationships then

4350
01:12:57,890 --> 01:12:57,900
are people in the relationships then
 

4351
01:12:57,900 --> 01:12:59,689
are people in the relationships then
yeah you I mean what are you gonna do

4352
01:12:59,689 --> 01:12:59,699
yeah you I mean what are you gonna do
 

4353
01:12:59,699 --> 01:13:00,950
yeah you I mean what are you gonna do
break up and then just be alone for the

4354
01:13:00,950 --> 01:13:00,960
break up and then just be alone for the
 

4355

4365
01:13:11,219 --> 01:13:13,010
understand it because you know being
normal is not always like this

4366
01:13:13,010 --> 01:13:13,020
normal is not always like this
 

4367
01:13:13,020 --> 01:13:16,250
normal is not always like this
conversation is not always great

4368
01:13:16,250 --> 01:13:16,260
conversation is not always great
 

4369
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:17,030
conversation is not always great
um

4370
01:13:17,030 --> 01:13:17,040
um
 

4371
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:18,950
um
meaning this this conversation is

4372
01:13:18,950 --> 01:13:18,960
meaning this this conversation is
 

4373
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:23,750
meaning this this conversation is
anything but normal okay and uh

4374
01:13:23,750 --> 01:13:23,760

 

4375
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:26,090

that was a tangent on a tangent about a

4376
01:13:26,090 --> 01:13:26,100
that was a tangent on a tangent about a
 

4377
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:27,709
that was a tangent on a tangent about a
niche passion which is really

4378
01:13:27,709 --> 01:13:27,719
niche passion which is really
 

4379
01:13:27,719 --> 01:13:29,030
niche passion which is really
fascinating that you're playing with

4380
01:13:29,030 --> 01:13:29,040
fascinating that you're playing with
 

4381
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:30,770
fascinating that you're playing with

like maybe I do but I'm interpreting it
 

4427
01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:11,390
like maybe I do but I'm interpreting it
differently I don't know the thing is I

4428
01:14:11,390 --> 01:14:11,400
differently I don't know the thing is I
 

4429
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:13,130
differently I don't know the thing is I
don't know what causes me to have such a

01:14:19,140 --> 01:14:20,990
hostile towards men and my guess is that
there's some sort of like very subtle

4438

there's some sort of like very subtle
 

4439
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,250
there's some sort of like very subtle
signaling that we're accidentally doing

signaling that we're accidentally doing
 

4441
01:14:22,260 --> 01:14:23,750
signaling that we're accidentally doing
be like no fault of our own I'm not

4442
01:14:23,750 --> 01:14:23,760
be like no fault of our own I'm not
 

4443

be like no fault of our own I'm not
saying this is a virtue I'm saying like

4444
01:14:25,070 --> 01:14:25,080
saying this is a virtue I'm saying like
 

4445
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:26,810
saying this is a virtue I'm saying like
maybe it's just genetic or the fact that

4446
01:14:26,810 --> 01:14:26,820
maybe it's just genetic or the fact that
 

4447
01:14:26,820 --> 01:14:28,910
maybe it's just genetic or the fact that
women are doing yeah that the women are

01:14:34,310 --> 01:14:34,320
accidentally through no intention like
 

4455
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:36,110
accidentally through no intention like
happening to Signal the thing that is

4456
01:14:36,110 --> 01:14:36,120
happening to Signal the thing that is
 

4457
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:38,330

thing to think about I mean they've done
 

4639
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:42,709
thing to think about I mean they've done
some studies but again like again I'm

4640
01:17:42,709 --> 01:17:42,719
some studies but again like again I'm
 

4641
01:17:42,719 --> 01:17:43,729
some studies but again like again I'm
not sure I haven't actually read the

4642
01:17:43,729 --> 01:17:43,739
not sure I haven't actually read the
 

4643
01:17:43,739 --> 01:17:44,870
not sure I haven't actually read the
study so maybe they didn't replicate

4644
01:17:44,870 --> 01:17:44,880
study so maybe they didn't replicate
 

4645
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:46,430
study so maybe they didn't replicate
where like they measured people before

4646
01:17:46,430 --> 01:17:46,440
where like they measured people before
 

4647
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:48,709
where like they measured people before
and after winning a bunch of money to

4648
01:17:48,709 --> 01:17:48,719
and after winning a bunch of money to

4653
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:54,290
think like it's by some measures it
wasn't by some it wasn't no I mean like

wasn't by some it wasn't no I mean like
 

4655
01:17:54,300 --> 01:17:56,270
wasn't by some it wasn't no I mean like
basically almost genetically so nature

4656
01:17:56,270 --> 01:17:56,280
basically almost genetically so nature
 

4657
01:17:56,280 --> 01:17:57,590
basically almost genetically so nature
nurture but

4658
01:17:57,590 --> 01:17:57,600
nurture but
 

4659
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:00,470

that all the environmental genetic
factors combine to create so that

01:28:40,679 --> 01:28:42,290
option
because like statistically speaking but

5292
01:28:42,290 --> 01:28:42,300
because like statistically speaking but
 

5293
01:28:42,300 --> 01:28:43,370
because like statistically speaking but
I feel like we can apply it to like a

5294
01:28:43,370 --> 01:28:43,380
I feel like we can apply it to like a
 

5295
01:28:43,380 --> 01:28:45,169
I feel like we can apply it to like a
bunch of other things yeah and I'm just

01:28:45,169 --> 01:28:45,179
bunch of other things yeah and I'm just

01:28:46,669 --> 01:28:46,679
this is just a problem if you have like
 

5299
01:28:46,679 --> 01:28:48,350
this is just a problem if you have like
high if you have a high volume to filter

5300
01:28:48,350 --> 01:28:48,360
high if you have a high volume to filter
 

5301
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:49,490
high if you have a high volume to filter
through and you're like you don't know

5302
01:28:49,490 --> 01:28:49,500
through and you're like you don't know
 

5303
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:51,709
through and you're like you don't know
like it's a good like initial filter

5304
01:28:51,709 --> 01:28:51,719
like it's a good like initial filter
 

5305
01:28:51,719 --> 01:28:53,390
like it's a good like initial filter
like you can take it from like a

5306
01:28:53,390 --> 01:28:53,400
like you can take it from like a
 

5307
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:54,890
like you can take it from like a
thousand people to 20 people and then go

5308
01:28:54,890 --> 01:28:54,900
thousand people to 20 people and then go
 

5309
01:28:54,900 --> 01:28:56,570

01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:30,709
but there's like out of the the Giant
pool of different preferences you

5466
01:31:30,709 --> 01:31:30,719
pool of different preferences you
 

5467
01:31:30,719 --> 01:31:32,629
pool of different preferences you
haven't like a subset that's clearly

5468
01:31:32,629 --> 01:31:32,639
haven't like a subset that's clearly
 

5469
01:31:32,639 --> 01:31:34,010
haven't like a subset that's clearly
defined for you

5470
01:31:34,010 --> 01:31:34,020
defined for you
 

5471
01:31:34,020 --> 01:31:37,490
defined for you
okay like like dominant submissive yeah

5472
01:31:37,490 --> 01:31:37,500
okay like like dominant submissive yeah
 

5473
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:39,050
okay like like dominant submissive yeah
Power Dynamic stuff hard to announce

5474
01:31:39,050 --> 01:31:39,060
Power Dynamic stuff hard to announce
 

5475
01:31:39,060 --> 01:31:40,729
Power Dynamic stuff hard to announce
that

5476
01:31:40,729 --> 01:31:40,739
that
 

5477
01:31:40,739 --> 01:31:43,430
that
okay in the not just sexual blend

5478
01:31:43,430 --> 01:31:43,440
okay in the not just sexual blend
 

5479
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:44,930
okay in the not just sexual blend
relationship too like that was that in a

5480
01:31:44,930 --> 01:31:44,940
relationship too like that was that in a
 

5481
01:31:44,940 --> 01:31:46,729
relationship too like that was that in a
survey I don't like paradigms in

5482
01:31:46,729 --> 01:31:46,739
survey I don't like paradigms in
 

5483
01:31:46,739 --> 01:31:48,709
survey I don't like paradigms in
relationships I'm not defining them in

5484
01:31:48,709 --> 01:31:48,719
relationships I'm not defining them in
 

5485
01:31:48,719 --> 01:31:50,689
relationships I'm not defining them in
like making it clear in a survey like

5486
01:31:50,689 --> 01:31:50,699
like making it clear in a survey like
 

5487
01:31:50,699 --> 01:31:52,669
like making it clear in a survey like
asking a question about power dynamics

5488
01:31:52,669 --> 01:31:52,679
asking a question about power dynamics
 

5489
01:31:52,679 --> 01:31:55,129
asking a question about power dynamics
in a relationship I don't think I asked

5490
01:31:55,129 --> 01:31:55,139
in a relationship I don't think I asked
 

5491
01:31:55,139 --> 01:31:56,629
in a relationship I don't think I asked
about power dynamics in relationships

5492
01:31:56,629 --> 01:31:56,639
about power dynamics in relationships
 

5493
01:31:56,639 --> 01:31:59,030
about power dynamics in relationships
okay because I just assume most people

5494
01:31:59,030 --> 01:31:59,040
okay because I just assume most people
 

5495
01:31:59,040 --> 01:32:00,890
okay because I just assume most people
don't and there's a lot of things that

5496
01:32:00,890 --> 01:32:00,900
don't and there's a lot of things that
 

5497
01:32:00,900 --> 01:32:02,390
don't and there's a lot of things that
are kind of like most people don't

5498
01:32:02,390 --> 01:32:02,400
are kind of like most people don't
 

5499
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:04,990
are kind of like most people don't
you're putting together a survey a

5500
01:32:04,990 --> 01:32:05,000
you're putting together a survey a
 

5501
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,770
you're putting together a survey a
systematic server to understand

5502
01:32:06,770 --> 01:32:06,780
systematic server to understand
 

5503
01:32:06,780 --> 01:32:08,870
systematic server to understand
compatibility

5504
01:32:08,870 --> 01:32:08,880
compatibility
 

5505
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:11,030
compatibility
wouldn't power dynamics inside of

5506
01:32:11,030 --> 01:32:11,040
wouldn't power dynamics inside of
 

5507
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:13,430
wouldn't power dynamics inside of
relationships that naturally emerge

5508
01:32:13,430 --> 01:32:13,440
relationships that naturally emerge
 

5509
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:16,910
relationships that naturally emerge
often be part of the question or or is

5510
01:32:16,910 --> 01:32:16,920
often be part of the question or or is
 

5511
01:32:16,920 --> 01:32:19,010
often be part of the question or or is
that is that hard to question because it

5512
01:32:19,010 --> 01:32:19,020
that is that hard to question because it
 

5513
01:32:19,020 --> 01:32:21,470
that is that hard to question because it
naturally emerges the thing is like a

5514
01:32:21,470 --> 01:32:21,480
naturally emerges the thing is like a
 

5515
01:32:21,480 --> 01:32:22,910
naturally emerges the thing is like a
lot of questions sort of overlap in

5516
01:32:22,910 --> 01:32:22,920
lot of questions sort of overlap in
 

5517
01:32:22,920 --> 01:32:24,590
lot of questions sort of overlap in
demographic and if you're making a

5518
01:32:24,590 --> 01:32:24,600
demographic and if you're making a
 

5519
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:25,790
demographic and if you're making a
survey you want to have the minimum

5520
01:32:25,790 --> 01:32:25,800
survey you want to have the minimum
 

5521
01:32:25,800 --> 01:32:28,070
survey you want to have the minimum
possible questions that give the maximum

5522
01:32:28,070 --> 01:32:28,080
possible questions that give the maximum
 

5523
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:30,530
possible questions that give the maximum
possible like filtering information so

5524
01:32:30,530 --> 01:32:30,540
possible like filtering information so
 

5525
01:32:30,540 --> 01:32:31,850
possible like filtering information so
wait a minute wait a minute wait a

5526
01:32:31,850 --> 01:32:31,860
wait a minute wait a minute wait a
 

5527
01:32:31,860 --> 01:32:33,410
wait a minute wait a minute wait a
minute wait a minute but that purpose of

5528
01:32:33,410 --> 01:32:33,420
minute wait a minute but that purpose of
 

5529
01:32:33,420 --> 01:32:35,030
minute wait a minute but that purpose of
that survey wasn't to do a good research

5530
01:32:35,030 --> 01:32:35,040
that survey wasn't to do a good research
 

5531
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:37,729
that survey wasn't to do a good research
study it was to select one subject that

5532
01:32:37,729 --> 01:32:37,739
study it was to select one subject that
 

5533
01:32:37,739 --> 01:32:38,930
study it was to select one subject that
you could take so that's part of what's

5534
01:32:38,930 --> 01:32:38,940
you could take so that's part of what's
 

5535
01:32:38,940 --> 01:32:40,250
you could take so that's part of what's
is good like you want to most

5536
01:32:40,250 --> 01:32:40,260
is good like you want to most
 

5537
01:32:40,260 --> 01:32:42,110
is good like you want to most
efficiently filter out because one like

5538
01:32:42,110 --> 01:32:42,120
efficiently filter out because one like
 

5539
01:32:42,120 --> 01:32:43,490
efficiently filter out because one like
you get more people taking the survey

5540
01:32:43,490 --> 01:32:43,500
you get more people taking the survey
 

5541
01:32:43,500 --> 01:32:44,870
you get more people taking the survey
the fewer questions you have which is

5542
01:32:44,870 --> 01:32:44,880
the fewer questions you have which is
 

5543
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:46,669
the fewer questions you have which is
good for finding a mate like if you have

5544
01:32:46,669 --> 01:32:46,679
good for finding a mate like if you have
 

5545
01:32:46,679 --> 01:32:48,350
good for finding a mate like if you have
5 000 men take the surveys better than

5546
01:32:48,350 --> 01:32:48,360
5 000 men take the surveys better than
 

5547
01:32:48,360 --> 01:32:49,729
5 000 men take the surveys better than
one thousand medications don't you want

5548
01:32:49,729 --> 01:32:49,739
one thousand medications don't you want
 

5549
01:32:49,739 --> 01:32:51,850
one thousand medications don't you want
men that that would be patient enough

5550
01:32:51,850 --> 01:32:51,860
men that that would be patient enough
 

5551
01:32:51,860 --> 01:32:54,169
men that that would be patient enough
and dedicated enough yeah but like what

5552
01:32:54,169 --> 01:32:54,179
and dedicated enough yeah but like what
 

5553
01:32:54,179 --> 01:32:55,669
and dedicated enough yeah but like what
if you're like a high-powered man who's

5554
01:32:55,669 --> 01:32:55,679
if you're like a high-powered man who's
 

5555
01:32:55,679 --> 01:32:57,770
if you're like a high-powered man who's
like on his lunch break yeah right so

5556
01:32:57,770 --> 01:32:57,780
like on his lunch break yeah right so
 

5557
01:32:57,780 --> 01:32:59,270
like on his lunch break yeah right so
it's like you're just like a billionaire

5558
01:32:59,270 --> 01:32:59,280
it's like you're just like a billionaire
 

5559
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:01,610
it's like you're just like a billionaire
is too busy just flipping through yeah

5560
01:33:01,610 --> 01:33:01,620
is too busy just flipping through yeah
 

5561
01:33:01,620 --> 01:33:03,470
is too busy just flipping through yeah
and the guy that I did was that he took

5562
01:33:03,470 --> 01:33:03,480
and the guy that I did was that he took
 

5563
01:33:03,480 --> 01:33:04,850
and the guy that I did was that he took
the survey he was waiting for the piece

5564
01:33:04,850 --> 01:33:04,860
the survey he was waiting for the piece
 

5565
01:33:04,860 --> 01:33:06,290
the survey he was waiting for the piece
to come to come out of the oven and so

5566
01:33:06,290 --> 01:33:06,300
to come to come out of the oven and so
 

5567
01:33:06,300 --> 01:33:08,810
to come to come out of the oven and so
it was important that it was short

5568
01:33:08,810 --> 01:33:08,820
it was important that it was short
 

5569
01:33:08,820 --> 01:33:10,970
it was important that it was short
are literally pizza coming he's

5570
01:33:10,970 --> 01:33:10,980
are literally pizza coming he's
 

5571
01:33:10,980 --> 01:33:12,950
are literally pizza coming he's
literally waiting for pizza and he saw

5572
01:33:12,950 --> 01:33:12,960
literally waiting for pizza and he saw
 

5573
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:14,390
literally waiting for pizza and he saw
the things like I guess I'll just fill

5574
01:33:14,390 --> 01:33:14,400
the things like I guess I'll just fill
 

5575
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:16,490
the things like I guess I'll just fill
up the survey really fast and it changed

5576
01:33:16,490 --> 01:33:16,500
up the survey really fast and it changed
 

5577
01:33:16,500 --> 01:33:19,370
up the survey really fast and it changed
our lives so romantic I I it's for me

5578
01:33:19,370 --> 01:33:19,380
our lives so romantic I I it's for me
 

5579
01:33:19,380 --> 01:33:20,990
our lives so romantic I I it's for me
this is my kind of Romance I'm really

5580
01:33:20,990 --> 01:33:21,000
this is my kind of Romance I'm really
 

5581
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,030
this is my kind of Romance I'm really
into it but but you could it could be

5582
01:33:23,030 --> 01:33:23,040
into it but but you could it could be
 

5583
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:24,649
into it but but you could it could be
efficient with surveys by like making

5584
01:33:24,649 --> 01:33:24,659
efficient with surveys by like making
 

5585
01:33:24,659 --> 01:33:26,030
efficient with surveys by like making
sure your questions don't overlap so for

5586
01:33:26,030 --> 01:33:26,040
sure your questions don't overlap so for
 

5587
01:33:26,040 --> 01:33:27,649
sure your questions don't overlap so for
example if somebody's very polyamorous

5588
01:33:27,649 --> 01:33:27,659
example if somebody's very polyamorous
 

5589
01:33:27,659 --> 01:33:29,450
example if somebody's very polyamorous
they're very unlikely to be interested

5590
01:33:29,450 --> 01:33:29,460
they're very unlikely to be interested
 

5591
01:33:29,460 --> 01:33:31,790
they're very unlikely to be interested
in like a traditional like man works and

5592
01:33:31,790 --> 01:33:31,800
in like a traditional like man works and
 

5593
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:33,649
in like a traditional like man works and
like and out and the job in the woman

5594
01:33:33,649 --> 01:33:33,659
like and out and the job in the woman
 

5595
01:33:33,659 --> 01:33:35,030
like and out and the job in the woman
stays home and raises the kids kind of

5596
01:33:35,030 --> 01:33:35,040
stays home and raises the kids kind of
 

5597
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:36,110
stays home and raises the kids kind of
relationship because probably people

5598
01:33:36,110 --> 01:33:36,120
relationship because probably people
 

5599
01:33:36,120 --> 01:33:37,970
relationship because probably people
just generally don't do that and so if

5600
01:33:37,970 --> 01:33:37,980
just generally don't do that and so if
 

5601
01:33:37,980 --> 01:33:39,709
just generally don't do that and so if
I'm asking about polyamory it's sort of

5602
01:33:39,709 --> 01:33:39,719
I'm asking about polyamory it's sort of
 

5603
01:33:39,719 --> 01:33:41,750
I'm asking about polyamory it's sort of
kind of already covers the thing and so

5604
01:33:41,750 --> 01:33:41,760
kind of already covers the thing and so
 

5605
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:42,649
kind of already covers the thing and so
if I have a whole bunch of questions

5606
01:33:42,649 --> 01:33:42,659
if I have a whole bunch of questions
 

5607
01:33:42,659 --> 01:33:44,689
if I have a whole bunch of questions
like I can kind of like triangulate a

5608
01:33:44,689 --> 01:33:44,699
like I can kind of like triangulate a
 

5609
01:33:44,699 --> 01:33:46,010
like I can kind of like triangulate a
bunch of implicit kinds of questions

5610
01:33:46,010 --> 01:33:46,020
bunch of implicit kinds of questions
 

5611
01:33:46,020 --> 01:33:48,110
bunch of implicit kinds of questions
that I haven't directly asked about

5612
01:33:48,110 --> 01:33:48,120
that I haven't directly asked about
 

5613
01:33:48,120 --> 01:33:49,430
that I haven't directly asked about
so this is why I didn't ask directly

5614
01:33:49,430 --> 01:33:49,440
so this is why I didn't ask directly
 

5615
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:51,110
so this is why I didn't ask directly
about power dynamics because like from

5616
01:33:51,110 --> 01:33:51,120
about power dynamics because like from
 

5617
01:33:51,120 --> 01:33:52,370
about power dynamics because like from
the rest of the questions that are in my

5618
01:33:52,370 --> 01:33:52,380
the rest of the questions that are in my
 

5619
01:33:52,380 --> 01:33:54,830
the rest of the questions that are in my
survey like I can pretty accurately

5620
01:33:54,830 --> 01:33:54,840
survey like I can pretty accurately
 

5621
01:33:54,840 --> 01:33:55,910
survey like I can pretty accurately
predict whether or not you're going to

5622
01:33:55,910 --> 01:33:55,920
predict whether or not you're going to
 

5623
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:58,189
predict whether or not you're going to
be interested in power dynamics but I'm

5624
01:33:58,189 --> 01:33:58,199
be interested in power dynamics but I'm
 

5625
01:33:58,199 --> 01:34:00,530
be interested in power dynamics but I'm
afraid yeah like I'm trying to think as

5626
01:34:00,530 --> 01:34:00,540
afraid yeah like I'm trying to think as
 

5627
01:34:00,540 --> 01:34:03,649
afraid yeah like I'm trying to think as
you're talking I get it it's

5628
01:34:03,649 --> 01:34:03,659
you're talking I get it it's
 

5629
01:34:03,659 --> 01:34:05,270
you're talking I get it it's
that's really interesting that you did

5630
01:34:05,270 --> 01:34:05,280
that's really interesting that you did
 

5631
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:07,189
that's really interesting that you did
that also maybe not for the

5632
01:34:07,189 --> 01:34:07,199
that also maybe not for the
 

5633
01:34:07,199 --> 01:34:08,810
that also maybe not for the
effectiveness of finding a partner but

5634
01:34:08,810 --> 01:34:08,820
effectiveness of finding a partner but
 

5635
01:34:08,820 --> 01:34:10,850
effectiveness of finding a partner but
for just exploring the actual the

5636
01:34:10,850 --> 01:34:10,860
for just exploring the actual the
 

5637
01:34:10,860 --> 01:34:12,050
for just exploring the actual the
process

5638
01:34:12,050 --> 01:34:12,060
process
 

5639
01:34:12,060 --> 01:34:15,290
process
of of human sexuality of of like the

5640
01:34:15,290 --> 01:34:15,300
of of human sexuality of of like the
 

5641
01:34:15,300 --> 01:34:17,209
of of human sexuality of of like the
search this this complicated

5642
01:34:17,209 --> 01:34:17,219
search this this complicated
 

5643
01:34:17,219 --> 01:34:19,070
search this this complicated
optimization process we're all engaging

5644
01:34:19,070 --> 01:34:19,080
optimization process we're all engaging
 

5645
01:34:19,080 --> 01:34:21,530
optimization process we're all engaging
in on the landscape of happiness that

5646
01:34:21,530 --> 01:34:21,540
in on the landscape of happiness that
 

5647
01:34:21,540 --> 01:34:23,870
in on the landscape of happiness that
seems to be uh this

5648
01:34:23,870 --> 01:34:23,880
seems to be uh this
 

5649
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:24,950
seems to be uh this
um

5650
01:34:24,950 --> 01:34:24,960
um
 

5651
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:27,350
um
not even a differentiable function it's

5652
01:34:27,350 --> 01:34:27,360
not even a differentiable function it's
 

5653
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:31,250
not even a differentiable function it's
it's a giant non-linear mess okay but

5654
01:34:31,250 --> 01:34:31,260
it's a giant non-linear mess okay but
 

5655
01:34:31,260 --> 01:34:32,689
it's a giant non-linear mess okay but
like for me I don't think I would be

5656
01:34:32,689 --> 01:34:32,699
like for me I don't think I would be
 

5657
01:34:32,699 --> 01:34:34,490
like for me I don't think I would be
able to design that survey I would like

5658
01:34:34,490 --> 01:34:34,500
able to design that survey I would like
 

5659
01:34:34,500 --> 01:34:37,070
able to design that survey I would like
bias it too strongly like um

5660
01:34:37,070 --> 01:34:37,080
bias it too strongly like um
 

5661
01:34:37,080 --> 01:34:40,070
bias it too strongly like um
I'll probably prefer women

5662
01:34:40,070 --> 01:34:40,080
I'll probably prefer women
 

5663
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:41,870
I'll probably prefer women
that have read Dostoevsky or something

5664
01:34:41,870 --> 01:34:41,880
that have read Dostoevsky or something
 

5665
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:43,729
that have read Dostoevsky or something
like that like there'll be a filter for

5666
01:34:43,729 --> 01:34:43,739
like that like there'll be a filter for
 

5667
01:34:43,739 --> 01:34:45,770
like that like there'll be a filter for
me right yeah but like that's a horrible

5668
01:34:45,770 --> 01:34:45,780
me right yeah but like that's a horrible
 

5669
01:34:45,780 --> 01:34:47,810
me right yeah but like that's a horrible
filter because there's a lot of like

5670
01:34:47,810 --> 01:34:47,820
filter because there's a lot of like
 

5671
01:34:47,820 --> 01:34:49,490
filter because there's a lot of like
there's a lot of amazing people that

5672
01:34:49,490 --> 01:34:49,500
there's a lot of amazing people that
 

5673
01:34:49,500 --> 01:34:50,570
there's a lot of amazing people that
have never they don't give a [\h__\h] about

5674
01:34:50,570 --> 01:34:50,580
have never they don't give a [\h__\h] about
 

5675
01:34:50,580 --> 01:34:52,010
have never they don't give a [\h__\h] about
reading or they don't give a [\h__\h] about

5676
01:34:52,010 --> 01:34:52,020
reading or they don't give a [\h__\h] about
 

5677
01:34:52,020 --> 01:34:53,510
reading or they don't give a [\h__\h] about
reading Russian literature or they don't

5678
01:34:53,510 --> 01:34:53,520
reading Russian literature or they don't
 

5679
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:55,189
reading Russian literature or they don't
give a [\h__\h] about but they're amazing

5680
01:34:55,189 --> 01:34:55,199
give a [\h__\h] about but they're amazing
 

5681
01:34:55,199 --> 01:34:57,350
give a [\h__\h] about but they're amazing
and passionate and creative and all in

5682
01:34:57,350 --> 01:34:57,360
and passionate and creative and all in
 

5683
01:34:57,360 --> 01:34:58,430
and passionate and creative and all in
some other dimension that you might

5684
01:34:58,430 --> 01:34:58,440
some other dimension that you might
 

5685
01:34:58,440 --> 01:35:00,830
some other dimension that you might
completely Miss but you're like because

5686
01:35:00,830 --> 01:35:00,840
completely Miss but you're like because
 

5687
01:35:00,840 --> 01:35:02,629
completely Miss but you're like because
I wonder if there's any basically you're

5688
01:35:02,629 --> 01:35:02,639
I wonder if there's any basically you're
 

5689
01:35:02,639 --> 01:35:04,370
I wonder if there's any basically you're
saying compatibility like hard lines

5690
01:35:04,370 --> 01:35:04,380
saying compatibility like hard lines
 

5691
01:35:04,380 --> 01:35:06,890
saying compatibility like hard lines
that you know statistically is just

5692
01:35:06,890 --> 01:35:06,900
that you know statistically is just
 

5693
01:35:06,900 --> 01:35:09,290
that you know statistically is just
going to be an issue yeah I mean you

5694
01:35:09,290 --> 01:35:09,300
going to be an issue yeah I mean you
 

5695
01:35:09,300 --> 01:35:11,090
going to be an issue yeah I mean you
wait this a lot more yeah but there's

5696
01:35:11,090 --> 01:35:11,100
wait this a lot more yeah but there's
 

5697
01:35:11,100 --> 01:35:12,470
wait this a lot more yeah but there's
also like preferences like if you have a

5698
01:35:12,470 --> 01:35:12,480
also like preferences like if you have a
 

5699
01:35:12,480 --> 01:35:14,270
also like preferences like if you have a
woman who's totally equal and she's read

5700
01:35:14,270 --> 01:35:14,280
woman who's totally equal and she's read
 

5701
01:35:14,280 --> 01:35:15,890
woman who's totally equal and she's read
the thing that you like virtue is

5702
01:35:15,890 --> 01:35:15,900
the thing that you like virtue is
 

5703
01:35:15,900 --> 01:35:17,209
the thing that you like virtue is
another woman who's also identical but

5704
01:35:17,209 --> 01:35:17,219
another woman who's also identical but
 

5705
01:35:17,219 --> 01:35:18,350
another woman who's also identical but
like she hasn't read the thing that you

5706
01:35:18,350 --> 01:35:18,360
like she hasn't read the thing that you
 

5707
01:35:18,360 --> 01:35:19,910
like she hasn't read the thing that you
like like you probably like very

5708
01:35:19,910 --> 01:35:19,920
like like you probably like very
 

5709
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:21,110
like like you probably like very
slightly prefer the one but you don't

5710
01:35:21,110 --> 01:35:21,120
slightly prefer the one but you don't
 

5711
01:35:21,120 --> 01:35:22,550
slightly prefer the one but you don't
know what the identity yes yes but like

5712
01:35:22,550 --> 01:35:22,560
know what the identity yes yes but like
 

5713
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:23,870
know what the identity yes yes but like
you can't through survey get the

5714
01:35:23,870 --> 01:35:23,880
you can't through survey get the
 

5715
01:35:23,880 --> 01:35:25,850
you can't through survey get the
identical like you don't know sure but

5716
01:35:25,850 --> 01:35:25,860
identical like you don't know sure but
 

5717
01:35:25,860 --> 01:35:27,350
identical like you don't know sure but
you can kind of like like do a whole

5718
01:35:27,350 --> 01:35:27,360
you can kind of like like do a whole
 

5719
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:28,490
you can kind of like like do a whole
bunch of weight so like the person that

5720
01:35:28,490 --> 01:35:28,500
bunch of weight so like the person that
 

5721
01:35:28,500 --> 01:35:29,810
bunch of weight so like the person that
like I ended up going on a date with he

5722
01:35:29,810 --> 01:35:29,820
like I ended up going on a date with he
 

5723
01:35:29,820 --> 01:35:31,790
like I ended up going on a date with he
and did not answer like correctly to a

5724
01:35:31,790 --> 01:35:31,800
and did not answer like correctly to a
 

5725
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:33,530
and did not answer like correctly to a
lot of the survey questions but he

5726
01:35:33,530 --> 01:35:33,540
lot of the survey questions but he
 

5727
01:35:33,540 --> 01:35:35,570
lot of the survey questions but he
didn't have to like he was just overall

5728
01:35:35,570 --> 01:35:35,580
didn't have to like he was just overall
 

5729
01:35:35,580 --> 01:35:37,310
didn't have to like he was just overall
overall the weights were like he just

5730
01:35:37,310 --> 01:35:37,320
overall the weights were like he just
 

5731
01:35:37,320 --> 01:35:39,110
overall the weights were like he just
tended to be more in the direction was

5732
01:35:39,110 --> 01:35:39,120
tended to be more in the direction was
 

5733
01:35:39,120 --> 01:35:41,450
tended to be more in the direction was
there a text-based fill in like a survey

5734
01:35:41,450 --> 01:35:41,460
there a text-based fill in like a survey
 

5735
01:35:41,460 --> 01:35:43,550
there a text-based fill in like a survey
but like uh sorry a paragraph like no

5736
01:35:43,550 --> 01:35:43,560
but like uh sorry a paragraph like no
 

5737
01:35:43,560 --> 01:35:44,810
but like uh sorry a paragraph like no
you want to avoid that if you're dealing

5738
01:35:44,810 --> 01:35:44,820
you want to avoid that if you're dealing
 

5739
01:35:44,820 --> 01:35:47,330
you want to avoid that if you're dealing
with like large amounts of data no why

5740
01:35:47,330 --> 01:35:47,340
with like large amounts of data no why
 

5741
01:35:47,340 --> 01:35:49,070
with like large amounts of data no why
not because you have to fill oh oh

5742
01:35:49,070 --> 01:35:49,080
not because you have to fill oh oh
 

5743
01:35:49,080 --> 01:35:51,709
not because you have to fill oh oh
interesting interesting like I'm I'm

5744
01:35:51,709 --> 01:35:51,719
interesting interesting like I'm I'm
 

5745
01:35:51,719 --> 01:35:53,450
interesting interesting like I'm I'm
different because like first of all you

5746
01:35:53,450 --> 01:35:53,460
different because like first of all you
 

5747
01:35:53,460 --> 01:35:55,970
different because like first of all you
can do keyword searches okay that's all

5748
01:35:55,970 --> 01:35:55,980
can do keyword searches okay that's all
 

5749
01:35:55,980 --> 01:35:57,229
can do keyword searches okay that's all
you do you can do machine learning

5750
01:35:57,229 --> 01:35:57,239
you do you can do machine learning
 

5751
01:35:57,239 --> 01:36:00,350
you do you can do machine learning
models that like like uh first of all

5752
01:36:00,350 --> 01:36:00,360
models that like like uh first of all
 

5753
01:36:00,360 --> 01:36:02,030
models that like like uh first of all
you can do you could do like crude

5754
01:36:02,030 --> 01:36:02,040
you can do you could do like crude
 

5755
01:36:02,040 --> 01:36:04,430
you can do you could do like crude
metrics like the length

5756
01:36:04,430 --> 01:36:04,440
metrics like the length
 

5757
01:36:04,440 --> 01:36:07,010
metrics like the length
that's a good point of how long they've

5758
01:36:07,010 --> 01:36:07,020
that's a good point of how long they've
 

5759
01:36:07,020 --> 01:36:08,570
that's a good point of how long they've
written right

5760
01:36:08,570 --> 01:36:08,580
written right
 

5761
01:36:08,580 --> 01:36:11,149
written right
and it could flag certain things yeah

5762
01:36:11,149 --> 01:36:11,159
and it could flag certain things yeah
 

5763
01:36:11,159 --> 01:36:13,129
and it could flag certain things yeah
it's actually pretty easy to like I've

5764
01:36:13,129 --> 01:36:13,139
it's actually pretty easy to like I've
 

5765
01:36:13,139 --> 01:36:14,689
it's actually pretty easy to like I've
I've looked at like for hiring I've

5766
01:36:14,689 --> 01:36:14,699
I've looked at like for hiring I've
 

5767
01:36:14,699 --> 01:36:16,490
I've looked at like for hiring I've
looked at like thousands of applications

5768
01:36:16,490 --> 01:36:16,500
looked at like thousands of applications
 

5769
01:36:16,500 --> 01:36:18,890
looked at like thousands of applications
really quickly you can really the the

5770
01:36:18,890 --> 01:36:18,900
really quickly you can really the the
 

5771
01:36:18,900 --> 01:36:19,970
really quickly you can really the the
human brain is really interesting

5772
01:36:19,970 --> 01:36:19,980
human brain is really interesting
 

5773
01:36:19,980 --> 01:36:21,709
human brain is really interesting
especially

5774
01:36:21,709 --> 01:36:21,719
especially
 

5775
01:36:21,719 --> 01:36:22,850
especially
um

5776
01:36:22,850 --> 01:36:22,860
um
 

5777
01:36:22,860 --> 01:36:25,610
um
like if you visually highlight certain

5778
01:36:25,610 --> 01:36:25,620
like if you visually highlight certain
 

5779
01:36:25,620 --> 01:36:28,270
like if you visually highlight certain
information for yourself like keywords

5780
01:36:28,270 --> 01:36:28,280
information for yourself like keywords
 

5781
01:36:28,280 --> 01:36:31,010
information for yourself like keywords
or again with machine learning models

5782
01:36:31,010 --> 01:36:31,020
or again with machine learning models
 

5783
01:36:31,020 --> 01:36:33,350
or again with machine learning models
like sentiment you can you can highlight

5784
01:36:33,350 --> 01:36:33,360
like sentiment you can you can highlight
 

5785
01:36:33,360 --> 01:36:34,850
like sentiment you can you can highlight
different parts that will catch your eye

5786
01:36:34,850 --> 01:36:34,860
different parts that will catch your eye
 

5787
01:36:34,860 --> 01:36:37,669
different parts that will catch your eye
better than not and I I can go through

5788
01:36:37,669 --> 01:36:37,679
better than not and I I can go through
 

5789
01:36:37,679 --> 01:36:39,470
better than not and I I can go through
just a huge number of applications are

5790
01:36:39,470 --> 01:36:39,480
just a huge number of applications are
 

5791
01:36:39,480 --> 01:36:40,790
just a huge number of applications are
you telling me I can use if I learn

5792
01:36:40,790 --> 01:36:40,800
you telling me I can use if I learn
 

5793
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:42,590
you telling me I can use if I learn
machine learning I can

5794
01:36:42,590 --> 01:36:42,600
machine learning I can
 

5795
01:36:42,600 --> 01:36:44,209
machine learning I can
process dating survey applications

5796
01:36:44,209 --> 01:36:44,219
process dating survey applications
 

5797
01:36:44,219 --> 01:36:47,090
process dating survey applications
better yes no like with textual yeah

5798
01:36:47,090 --> 01:36:47,100
better yes no like with textual yeah
 

5799
01:36:47,100 --> 01:36:48,410
better yes no like with textual yeah
like I can like have them write things

5800
01:36:48,410 --> 01:36:48,420
like I can like have them write things
 

5801
01:36:48,420 --> 01:36:50,810
like I can like have them write things
in like this is like a new way of that

5802
01:36:50,810 --> 01:36:50,820
in like this is like a new way of that
 

5803
01:36:50,820 --> 01:36:51,950
in like this is like a new way of that
would be yeah it's a really good

5804
01:36:51,950 --> 01:36:51,960
would be yeah it's a really good
 

5805
01:36:51,960 --> 01:36:54,050
would be yeah it's a really good
incentive I think that would so it's a

5806
01:36:54,050 --> 01:36:54,060
incentive I think that would so it's a
 

5807
01:36:54,060 --> 01:36:56,330
incentive I think that would so it's a
really nice aspect

5808
01:36:56,330 --> 01:36:56,340
really nice aspect
 

5809
01:36:56,340 --> 01:36:59,750
really nice aspect
of text input like long form text input

5810
01:36:59,750 --> 01:36:59,760
of text input like long form text input
 

5811
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:02,209
of text input like long form text input
multiple long form text input based on

5812
01:37:02,209 --> 01:37:02,219
multiple long form text input based on
 

5813
01:37:02,219 --> 01:37:04,970
multiple long form text input based on
an interestingly phrased question is you

5814
01:37:04,970 --> 01:37:04,980
an interestingly phrased question is you
 

5815
01:37:04,980 --> 01:37:07,729
an interestingly phrased question is you
get to learn how to make a better survey

5816
01:37:07,729 --> 01:37:07,739
get to learn how to make a better survey
 

5817
01:37:07,739 --> 01:37:09,470
get to learn how to make a better survey
I think you would appreciate that like

5818
01:37:09,470 --> 01:37:09,480
I think you would appreciate that like
 

5819
01:37:09,480 --> 01:37:11,030
I think you would appreciate that like
you start to see how they're actually

5820
01:37:11,030 --> 01:37:11,040
you start to see how they're actually
 

5821
01:37:11,040 --> 01:37:13,070
you start to see how they're actually
interacting with these questions like I

5822
01:37:13,070 --> 01:37:13,080
interacting with these questions like I
 

5823
01:37:13,080 --> 01:37:15,229
interacting with these questions like I
ask certain questions like um just to

5824
01:37:15,229 --> 01:37:15,239
ask certain questions like um just to
 

5825
01:37:15,239 --> 01:37:17,510
ask certain questions like um just to
see how people think is it better to

5826
01:37:17,510 --> 01:37:17,520
see how people think is it better to
 

5827
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:19,490
see how people think is it better to
work smart or better to work hard

5828
01:37:19,490 --> 01:37:19,500
work smart or better to work hard
 

5829
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:20,750
work smart or better to work hard
foreign

5830
01:37:20,750 --> 01:37:20,760
foreign
 

5831
01:37:20,760 --> 01:37:23,390
foreign
or

5832
01:37:23,390 --> 01:37:23,400
or
 

5833
01:37:23,400 --> 01:37:26,990
or
um is it uh ever okay to betray a close

5834
01:37:26,990 --> 01:37:27,000
um is it uh ever okay to betray a close
 

5835
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:28,090
um is it uh ever okay to betray a close
friend

5836
01:37:28,090 --> 01:37:28,100
friend
 

5837
01:37:28,100 --> 01:37:30,590
friend
like I'll ask like questions like this

5838
01:37:30,590 --> 01:37:30,600
like I'll ask like questions like this
 

5839
01:37:30,600 --> 01:37:31,729
like I'll ask like questions like this
that don't really have a right answer

5840
01:37:31,729 --> 01:37:31,739
that don't really have a right answer
 

5841
01:37:31,739 --> 01:37:33,229
that don't really have a right answer
but I just want to see how they think or

5842
01:37:33,229 --> 01:37:33,239
but I just want to see how they think or
 

5843
01:37:33,239 --> 01:37:35,689
but I just want to see how they think or
is uh truth more important than loyalty

5844
01:37:35,689 --> 01:37:35,699
is uh truth more important than loyalty
 

5845
01:37:35,699 --> 01:37:36,709
is uh truth more important than loyalty
yeah

5846
01:37:36,709 --> 01:37:36,719
yeah
 

5847
01:37:36,719 --> 01:37:39,169
yeah
and and I get their long-form answer you

5848
01:37:39,169 --> 01:37:39,179
and and I get their long-form answer you
 

5849
01:37:39,179 --> 01:37:40,189
and and I get their long-form answer you
get like and you get to see the

5850
01:37:40,189 --> 01:37:40,199
get like and you get to see the
 

5851
01:37:40,199 --> 01:37:42,290
get like and you get to see the
reasoning process yeah yeah like what

5852
01:37:42,290 --> 01:37:42,300
reasoning process yeah yeah like what
 

5853
01:37:42,300 --> 01:37:45,350
reasoning process yeah yeah like what
they it reveals so much not just about

5854
01:37:45,350 --> 01:37:45,360
they it reveals so much not just about
 

5855
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:47,030
they it reveals so much not just about
the person but about the kind of

5856
01:37:47,030 --> 01:37:47,040
the person but about the kind of
 

5857
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:48,530
the person but about the kind of
questions I want I should be asking that

5858
01:37:48,530 --> 01:37:48,540
questions I want I should be asking that
 

5859
01:37:48,540 --> 01:37:50,270
questions I want I should be asking that
has nothing to do with truth or loyalty

5860
01:37:50,270 --> 01:37:50,280
has nothing to do with truth or loyalty
 

5861
01:37:50,280 --> 01:37:52,250
has nothing to do with truth or loyalty
but like how to get a good engineer with

5862
01:37:52,250 --> 01:37:52,260
but like how to get a good engineer with
 

5863
01:37:52,260 --> 01:37:54,110
but like how to get a good engineer with
like very specific questions but I think

5864
01:37:54,110 --> 01:37:54,120
like very specific questions but I think
 

5865
01:37:54,120 --> 01:37:56,629
like very specific questions but I think
it's really useful to get text input I I

5866
01:37:56,629 --> 01:37:56,639
it's really useful to get text input I I
 

5867
01:37:56,639 --> 01:37:58,610
it's really useful to get text input I I
have done text input usually with beta

5868
01:37:58,610 --> 01:37:58,620
have done text input usually with beta
 

5869
01:37:58,620 --> 01:37:59,810
have done text input usually with beta
surveys so I usually do beta service

5870
01:37:59,810 --> 01:37:59,820
surveys so I usually do beta service
 

5871
01:37:59,820 --> 01:38:01,310
surveys so I usually do beta service
before I do the real survey what's the

5872
01:38:01,310 --> 01:38:01,320
before I do the real survey what's the
 

5873
01:38:01,320 --> 01:38:03,110
before I do the real survey what's the
biggest like I do like a shorter version

5874
01:38:03,110 --> 01:38:03,120
biggest like I do like a shorter version
 

5875
01:38:03,120 --> 01:38:04,910
biggest like I do like a shorter version
or it depends on what I'm doing but like

5876
01:38:04,910 --> 01:38:04,920
or it depends on what I'm doing but like
 

5877
01:38:04,920 --> 01:38:07,129
or it depends on what I'm doing but like
a different version of the survey that I

5878
01:38:07,129 --> 01:38:07,139
a different version of the survey that I
 

5879
01:38:07,139 --> 01:38:08,810
a different version of the survey that I
have people take before I release I use

5880
01:38:08,810 --> 01:38:08,820
have people take before I release I use
 

5881
01:38:08,820 --> 01:38:10,490
have people take before I release I use
the information from the initial survey

5882
01:38:10,490 --> 01:38:10,500
the information from the initial survey
 

5883
01:38:10,500 --> 01:38:12,050
the information from the initial survey
to inform the questions that I ask in

5884
01:38:12,050 --> 01:38:12,060
to inform the questions that I ask in
 

5885
01:38:12,060 --> 01:38:13,910
to inform the questions that I ask in
the real survey and I haven't actually

5886
01:38:13,910 --> 01:38:13,920
the real survey and I haven't actually
 

5887
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:16,129
the real survey and I haven't actually
in recently but I used to do a lot of

5888
01:38:16,129 --> 01:38:16,139
in recently but I used to do a lot of
 

5889
01:38:16,139 --> 01:38:18,229
in recently but I used to do a lot of
like the text-based questions to see for

5890
01:38:18,229 --> 01:38:18,239
like the text-based questions to see for
 

5891
01:38:18,239 --> 01:38:19,610
like the text-based questions to see for
similar although I don't think I relied

5892
01:38:19,610 --> 01:38:19,620
similar although I don't think I relied
 

5893
01:38:19,620 --> 01:38:21,169
similar although I don't think I relied
it on it quite as heavily and if I

5894
01:38:21,169 --> 01:38:21,179
it on it quite as heavily and if I
 

5895
01:38:21,179 --> 01:38:22,310
it on it quite as heavily and if I
introduce machine learning things would

5896
01:38:22,310 --> 01:38:22,320
introduce machine learning things would
 

5897
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:24,410
introduce machine learning things would
be a lot more efficient I love that

5898
01:38:24,410 --> 01:38:24,420
be a lot more efficient I love that
 

5899
01:38:24,420 --> 01:38:26,030
be a lot more efficient I love that
you're also doing like you're writing

5900
01:38:26,030 --> 01:38:26,040
you're also doing like you're writing
 

5901
01:38:26,040 --> 01:38:27,590
you're also doing like you're writing
scripts and stuff like you're doing

5902
01:38:27,590 --> 01:38:27,600
scripts and stuff like you're doing
 

5903
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:29,629
scripts and stuff like you're doing
you're doing something like uh like

5904
01:38:29,629 --> 01:38:29,639
you're doing something like uh like
 

5905
01:38:29,639 --> 01:38:31,310
you're doing something like uh like
statistical analysis are using python

5906
01:38:31,310 --> 01:38:31,320
statistical analysis are using python
 

5907
01:38:31,320 --> 01:38:37,570
statistical analysis are using python
also yeah I had to Learn Python for

5908
01:38:37,570 --> 01:38:37,580

 

5909
01:38:37,580 --> 01:38:40,070

and the best reason to learn machine

5910
01:38:40,070 --> 01:38:40,080
and the best reason to learn machine
 

5911
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:42,530
and the best reason to learn machine
learning is to solve actual like

5912
01:38:42,530 --> 01:38:42,540
learning is to solve actual like
 

5913
01:38:42,540 --> 01:38:44,689
learning is to solve actual like
problems I can't be motivated I'm just

5914
01:38:44,689 --> 01:38:44,699
problems I can't be motivated I'm just
 

5915
01:38:44,699 --> 01:38:45,890
problems I can't be motivated I'm just
not motivated to learn something unless

5916
01:38:45,890 --> 01:38:45,900
not motivated to learn something unless
 

5917
01:38:45,900 --> 01:38:47,570
not motivated to learn something unless
there's an actual curiosity I have and I

5918
01:38:47,570 --> 01:38:47,580
there's an actual curiosity I have and I
 

5919
01:38:47,580 --> 01:38:48,950
there's an actual curiosity I have and I
have to learn it to solve it I was

5920
01:38:48,950 --> 01:38:48,960
have to learn it to solve it I was
 

5921
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:50,629
have to learn it to solve it I was
trying to avoid learning coding for so

5922
01:38:50,629 --> 01:38:50,639
trying to avoid learning coding for so
 

5923
01:38:50,639 --> 01:38:52,490
trying to avoid learning coding for so
long but eventually it was my data set

5924
01:38:52,490 --> 01:38:52,500
long but eventually it was my data set
 

5925
01:38:52,500 --> 01:38:54,590
long but eventually it was my data set
became too large I couldn't work with it

5926
01:38:54,590 --> 01:38:54,600
became too large I couldn't work with it
 

5927
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:56,209
became too large I couldn't work with it
with anything else so

5928
01:38:56,209 --> 01:38:56,219
with anything else so
 

5929
01:38:56,219 --> 01:38:58,370
with anything else so
oh python it is you know what's also an

5930
01:38:58,370 --> 01:38:58,380
oh python it is you know what's also an
 

5931

oh python it is you know what's also an
interesting data set that you're

5932
01:38:59,330 --> 01:38:59,340
interesting data set that you're
 

5933
01:38:59,340 --> 01:39:01,010
interesting data set that you're
probably interested in a little bit is

5934
01:39:01,010 --> 01:39:01,020
probably interested in a little bit is
 

5935
01:39:01,020 --> 01:39:03,169

5955
01:39:24,659 --> 01:39:26,270
like there's like I don't know the
number's insane the number of

5956
01:39:26,270 --> 01:39:26,280
number's insane the number of
 

5957

interactions but there's different
 

5959
01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:31,850
interactions but there's different
ways to interact to get data from

look at individual tweets and get entire
which to me is super interesting the

5970
01:39:42,770 --> 01:39:42,780
which to me is super interesting the
 

5971
01:39:42,780 --> 01:39:44,149
which to me is super interesting the
entire tree of different conversations

5972
01:39:44,149 --> 01:39:44,159
entire tree of different conversations
 

5973
01:39:44,159 --> 01:39:46,910
entire tree of different conversations
or the replies which might be very

5974

or the replies which might be very
 

5975
01:39:46,920 --> 01:39:49,430
or the replies which might be very
interesting for you because like

interesting for you because like
 

5977
01:39:49,440 --> 01:39:51,169
interesting for you because like
it's not

5978

it's not
 

5979
01:39:51,179 --> 01:39:54,350
it's not
I it's it's much harder to ask rigorous

5980
01:39:54,350 --> 01:39:54,360
I it's it's much harder to ask rigorous
 

5981

I it's it's much harder to ask rigorous
questions which you do with your polls

questions which you do with your polls
 

5983
01:39:56,100 --> 01:39:58,610
questions which you do with your polls
but you could see like how divisive

5984
01:39:58,610 --> 01:39:58,620
but you could see like how divisive
 

5985
01:39:58,620 --> 01:40:01,550
but you could see like how divisive
certain things are yeah like calibrators

5986
01:40:01,550 --> 01:40:01,560
certain things are yeah like calibrators
 

5987
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:02,930
certain things are yeah like calibrators
to figure out like exactly what

5988
01:40:02,930 --> 01:40:02,940
to figure out like exactly what
 

5989
01:40:02,940 --> 01:40:05,330
to figure out like exactly what
questions you should be asking yeah and

questions you should be asking yeah and
also highlight interesting anecdotal

5992
01:40:07,430 --> 01:40:07,440
also highlight interesting anecdotal
 

5993
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:09,470
also highlight interesting anecdotal
things when like two people freak out at

5994
01:40:09,470 --> 01:40:09,480
things when like two people freak out at
 

5995
01:40:09,480 --> 01:40:11,390
things when like two people freak out at
each other and just argue like a thread

01:40:11,390 --> 01:40:11,400
each other and just argue like a thread
 

5997
01:40:11,400 --> 01:40:12,709
each other and just argue like a thread
that goes on for like a thousand

because Twitter doesn't like surface
 

6005
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:19,729
because Twitter doesn't like surface

6015
01:40:28,199 --> 01:40:30,590
something that's controversial that gets
a large amount of attention it you can't

6016
01:40:30,590 --> 01:40:30,600
a large amount of attention it you can't
 

6017
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:32,330
a large amount of attention it you can't
clearly visualize everything that's

6018

clearly visualize everything that's
 

6019
01:40:32,340 --> 01:40:35,090
clearly visualize everything that's
going on yeah like it's it's very

6020
01:40:35,090 --> 01:40:35,100
going on yeah like it's it's very
 

6021

going on yeah like it's it's very
it's a blurry amorphous like you're just

6022
01:40:38,149 --> 01:40:38,159
it's a blurry amorphous like you're just
 

6023
01:40:38,159 --> 01:40:39,649
it's a blurry amorphous like you're just
kind of looking through the fog at

6024
01:40:39,649 --> 01:40:39,659
kind of looking through the fog at
 

6025
01:40:39,659 --> 01:40:41,510
kind of looking through the fog at
different replies and the kind of it's

6026
01:40:41,510 --> 01:40:41,520
different replies and the kind of it's
 

6027
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:44,209
different replies and the kind of it's
uh yeah so the API they have like like

6028
01:40:44,209 --> 01:40:44,219
uh yeah so the API they have like like
 

6029
01:40:44,219 --> 01:40:46,790
uh yeah so the API they have like like
graphs of networks they have the data

6030
01:40:46,790 --> 01:40:46,800
graphs of networks they have the data
 

6031
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:48,110
graphs of networks they have the data
for the graphs yeah so you can

6032
01:40:48,110 --> 01:40:48,120
for the graphs yeah so you can
 

6033
01:40:48,120 --> 01:40:50,450
for the graphs yeah so you can
reconstruct yourself yeah and then you

6034
01:40:50,450 --> 01:40:50,460
reconstruct yourself yeah and then you
 

6035
01:40:50,460 --> 01:40:52,070
reconstruct yourself yeah and then you
have different levels of access in terms

6036
01:40:52,070 --> 01:40:52,080
have different levels of access in terms
 

6037
01:40:52,080 --> 01:40:54,470
have different levels of access in terms
of how many queries you can do

6038
01:40:54,470 --> 01:40:54,480
of how many queries you can do
 

6039
01:40:54,480 --> 01:40:56,570
of how many queries you can do
that's really cool and now because

6040
01:40:56,570 --> 01:40:56,580
that's really cool and now because
 

6041
01:40:56,580 --> 01:40:59,629
that's really cool and now because
there's like uh Elon

6042
01:40:59,629 --> 01:40:59,639
there's like uh Elon
 

6043
01:40:59,639 --> 01:41:02,050
there's like uh Elon
um there's a lot of sort of

6044
01:41:02,050 --> 01:41:02,060
um there's a lot of sort of
 

6045
01:41:02,060 --> 01:41:04,070
um there's a lot of sort of
revolutionary stuff happening at Twitter

6046
01:41:04,070 --> 01:41:04,080
revolutionary stuff happening at Twitter
 

6047
01:41:04,080 --> 01:41:05,110
revolutionary stuff happening at Twitter
I think

6048
01:41:05,110 --> 01:41:05,120
I think
 

6049
01:41:05,120 --> 01:41:07,610
I think
you could literally sort of push for

6050
01:41:07,610 --> 01:41:07,620
you could literally sort of push for
 

6051
01:41:07,620 --> 01:41:10,129
you could literally sort of push for
Innovation there like there's aggressive

6052
01:41:10,129 --> 01:41:10,139
Innovation there like there's aggressive
 

6053
01:41:10,139 --> 01:41:12,590
Innovation there like there's aggressive
Innovation happening so in terms of uh

6054
01:41:12,590 --> 01:41:12,600
Innovation happening so in terms of uh
 

6055
01:41:12,600 --> 01:41:14,090
Innovation happening so in terms of uh
requesting stuff for the API you could

6056
01:41:14,090 --> 01:41:14,100
requesting stuff for the API you could
 

6057
01:41:14,100 --> 01:41:15,470
requesting stuff for the API you could
do all that kind of stuff I think

6058
01:41:15,470 --> 01:41:15,480
do all that kind of stuff I think
 

6059
01:41:15,480 --> 01:41:17,990
do all that kind of stuff I think
Twitter is just a fascinating platform

6060
01:41:17,990 --> 01:41:18,000
Twitter is just a fascinating platform
 

6061
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,750
Twitter is just a fascinating platform
for the as cliche as it sounds for

6062
01:41:20,750 --> 01:41:20,760
for the as cliche as it sounds for
 

6063
01:41:20,760 --> 01:41:22,550
for the as cliche as it sounds for
studying

6064
01:41:22,550 --> 01:41:22,560
studying
 

6065
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:24,770
studying
for me it's interesting what makes for a

6066
01:41:24,770 --> 01:41:24,780
for me it's interesting what makes for a
 

6067
01:41:24,780 --> 01:41:26,629
for me it's interesting what makes for a
healthy conversation that term has been

6068
01:41:26,629 --> 01:41:26,639
healthy conversation that term has been
 

6069
01:41:26,639 --> 01:41:28,310
healthy conversation that term has been
used but it's interesting how

6070
01:41:28,310 --> 01:41:28,320
used but it's interesting how
 

6071
01:41:28,320 --> 01:41:29,870
used but it's interesting how
conversation to me is fascinating how

6072
01:41:29,870 --> 01:41:29,880
conversation to me is fascinating how
 

6073
01:41:29,880 --> 01:41:31,610
conversation to me is fascinating how
conversations break down

6074
01:41:31,610 --> 01:41:31,620
conversations break down
 

6075
01:41:31,620 --> 01:41:37,189
conversations break down
and not like how like the virality of

6076
01:41:37,189 --> 01:41:37,199
and not like how like the virality of
 

6077
01:41:37,199 --> 01:41:38,870
and not like how like the virality of
drama

6078
01:41:38,870 --> 01:41:38,880
drama
 

6079
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:42,709
drama
or conflict or disagreement how that

6080
01:41:42,709 --> 01:41:42,719
or conflict or disagreement how that
 

6081
01:41:42,719 --> 01:41:44,930
or conflict or disagreement how that
evolves when a large number of people

6082
01:41:44,930 --> 01:41:44,940
evolves when a large number of people
 

6083
01:41:44,940 --> 01:41:47,689
evolves when a large number of people
are involved when a large number of this

6084
01:41:47,689 --> 01:41:47,699
are involved when a large number of this
 

6085
01:41:47,699 --> 01:41:49,070
are involved when a large number of this
no no

6086
01:41:49,070 --> 01:41:49,080
no no
 

6087
01:41:49,080 --> 01:41:51,950
no no
um misinterpretation of of statements is

6088

pretty easy because escorting is not

6284
01:45:08,149 --> 01:45:08,159
pretty easy because escorting is not
 

6285

pretty easy because escorting is not

6307
01:45:25,560 --> 01:45:27,169
into everybody else so it's very fast
paced and like really tough with

escorting you don't get to see what

6310
01:45:28,430 --> 01:45:28,440
escorting you don't get to see what
 

6311
01:45:28,440 --> 01:45:29,810
escorting you don't get to see what
other girls are doing you can look at

6312
01:45:29,810 --> 01:45:29,820
other girls are doing you can look at
 

6313
01:45:29,820 --> 01:45:31,010
other girls are doing you can look at
their websites but like you don't know

6314
01:45:31,010 --> 01:45:31,020
their websites but like you don't know
 

6315
01:45:31,020 --> 01:45:32,510
their websites but like you don't know
what they're doing with clients at all

6316
01:45:32,510 --> 01:45:32,520
what they're doing with clients at all
 

6317
01:45:32,520 --> 01:45:34,189
what they're doing with clients at all
you can look at their rates but you

6318
01:45:34,189 --> 01:45:34,199
you can look at their rates but you
 

6319
01:45:34,199 --> 01:45:35,570
you can look at their rates but you
don't know what their volume is so you

6320
01:45:35,570 --> 01:45:35,580
don't know what their volume is so you
 

6321
01:45:35,580 --> 01:45:37,430
don't know what their volume is so you
don't actually know what is successful

6322
01:45:37,430 --> 01:45:37,440
don't actually know what is successful
 

6323
01:45:37,440 --> 01:45:39,169
don't actually know what is successful
and what isn't very much

6324
01:45:39,169 --> 01:45:39,179
and what isn't very much
 

6325
01:45:39,179 --> 01:45:41,510
and what isn't very much
um so I think there's much less uh like

6326
01:45:41,510 --> 01:45:41,520
um so I think there's much less uh like

01:46:46,199 --> 01:46:48,109
um you used to do 1200 to 1400 an hour
and then you said that you're thinking

6400
01:46:48,109 --> 01:46:48,119
and then you said that you're thinking
 

6401
01:46:48,119 --> 01:46:51,530
and then you said that you're thinking
of jumping back in at a rate of 2400

6402
01:46:51,530 --> 01:46:51,540
of jumping back in at a rate of 2400
 

6403
01:46:51,540 --> 01:46:55,850
of jumping back in at a rate of 2400
the first hour yeah and I think 900 each

6404
01:46:55,850 --> 01:46:55,860
the first hour yeah and I think 900 each
 

6405
01:46:55,860 --> 01:46:58,669
the first hour yeah and I think 900 each
successful hour that's interesting

6406
01:46:58,669 --> 01:46:58,679
successful hour that's interesting
 

6407
01:46:58,679 --> 01:47:00,470
successful hour that's interesting
that's like that's that I mean to me

6408
01:47:00,470 --> 01:47:00,480
that's like that's that I mean to me
 

6409
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:01,729
that's like that's that I mean to me
that's really interesting like the for

6410
01:47:01,729 --> 01:47:01,739
that's really interesting like the for
 

6411
01:47:01,739 --> 01:47:05,390
that's really interesting like the for
like why it's like the first hour yeah

6412
01:47:05,390 --> 01:47:05,400
like why it's like the first hour yeah
 

6413
01:47:05,400 --> 01:47:08,510
like why it's like the first hour yeah
oh it's just because uh it depends on

6414
01:47:08,510 --> 01:47:08,520
oh it's just because uh it depends on
 

6415
01:47:08,520 --> 01:47:10,189
oh it's just because uh it depends on
how you want to incentivize like the

6416
01:47:10,189 --> 01:47:10,199
how you want to incentivize like the
 

6417
01:47:10,199 --> 01:47:11,810
how you want to incentivize like the
amount of hours so if you have to pay a

6418
01:47:11,810 --> 01:47:11,820
amount of hours so if you have to pay a
 

6419
01:47:11,820 --> 01:47:13,070
amount of hours so if you have to pay a
lot for the first star but not very much

6420
01:47:13,070 --> 01:47:13,080
lot for the first star but not very much
 

6421
01:47:13,080 --> 01:47:14,330
lot for the first star but not very much
for the success if you're more likely to

6422
01:47:14,330 --> 01:47:14,340
for the success if you're more likely to
 

6423
01:47:14,340 --> 01:47:16,430
for the success if you're more likely to
buy like a longer period of time and

6424
01:47:16,430 --> 01:47:16,440
buy like a longer period of time and
 

6425
01:47:16,440 --> 01:47:18,169
buy like a longer period of time and
usually I find that clients who buy a

6426
01:47:18,169 --> 01:47:18,179
usually I find that clients who buy a
 

6427
01:47:18,179 --> 01:47:21,410
usually I find that clients who buy a
longer period of time are nicer to you I

6428
01:47:21,410 --> 01:47:21,420
longer period of time are nicer to you I
 

6429
01:47:21,420 --> 01:47:22,550
longer period of time are nicer to you I
don't have like a great theory for why

6430
01:47:22,550 --> 01:47:22,560
don't have like a great theory for why
 

6431
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:23,930
don't have like a great theory for why
that is but there's more likely like

6432
01:47:23,930 --> 01:47:23,940
that is but there's more likely like
 

6433
01:47:23,940 --> 01:47:25,010
that is but there's more likely like
taking dinner and get to know you first

6434
01:47:25,010 --> 01:47:25,020
taking dinner and get to know you first
 

6435
01:47:25,020 --> 01:47:26,870
taking dinner and get to know you first
and I just enjoy that a lot more I enjoy

6436
01:47:26,870 --> 01:47:26,880
and I just enjoy that a lot more I enjoy
 

6437
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:27,830
and I just enjoy that a lot more I enjoy
like

6438
01:47:27,830 --> 01:47:27,840
like
 

6439
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:31,189
like
like knowing who I'm gonna have sex with

6440
01:47:31,189 --> 01:47:31,199

like a date you know yeah so it

6442
01:47:33,410 --> 01:47:33,420
like a date you know yeah so it
 

6443
01:47:33,420 --> 01:47:35,870
like a date you know yeah so it
incentivize the the long form date

6444
01:47:35,870 --> 01:47:35,880
incentivize the the long form date
 

6445
01:47:35,880 --> 01:47:39,290
incentivize the the long form date
Dynamic versus like uh not that's really

6446
01:47:39,290 --> 01:47:39,300
Dynamic versus like uh not that's really
 

6447
01:47:39,300 --> 01:47:40,490
Dynamic versus like uh not that's really
interesting

6448
01:47:40,490 --> 01:47:40,500
interesting
 

6449
01:47:40,500 --> 01:47:43,189
interesting
that's so interesting how does money

6450
01:47:43,189 --> 01:47:43,199
that's so interesting how does money
 

6451
01:47:43,199 --> 01:47:45,950
that's so interesting how does money
change the dynamic just basic human

6452
01:47:45,950 --> 01:47:45,960
change the dynamic just basic human
 

6453
01:47:45,960 --> 01:47:48,109
change the dynamic just basic human
Dynamic of interacting for free versus

6454
01:47:48,109 --> 01:47:48,119
Dynamic of interacting for free versus
 

6455
01:47:48,119 --> 01:47:50,209
Dynamic of interacting for free versus
for money like I think about that a lot

6456
01:47:50,209 --> 01:47:50,219
for money like I think about that a lot
 

6457
01:47:50,219 --> 01:47:51,950
for money like I think about that a lot
it's like just talking to rich people

6458
01:47:51,950 --> 01:47:51,960
it's like just talking to rich people
 

6459
01:47:51,960 --> 01:47:53,570
it's like just talking to rich people
it's like you usually get paid for your

6460
01:47:53,570 --> 01:47:53,580
it's like you usually get paid for your
 

6461
01:47:53,580 --> 01:47:57,169
it's like you usually get paid for your
time and you're doing this for free like

6462
01:47:57,169 --> 01:47:57,179
time and you're doing this for free like
 

6463
01:47:57,179 --> 01:47:59,090
time and you're doing this for free like
what uh

6464
01:47:59,090 --> 01:47:59,100
what uh
 

6465
01:47:59,100 --> 01:48:00,950
what uh
like what's the difference is there a

6466
01:48:00,950 --> 01:48:00,960
like what's the difference is there a
 

6467
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:04,550
like what's the difference is there a
difference really or no

6468
01:48:04,550 --> 01:48:04,560

 

6469
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:06,649

so when I was doing it full time it was

6470
01:48:06,649 --> 01:48:06,659
so when I was doing it full time it was
 

6471
01:48:06,659 --> 01:48:08,689
so when I was doing it full time it was
my only source of income

6472
01:48:08,689 --> 01:48:08,699
my only source of income
 

6473
01:48:08,699 --> 01:48:10,430
my only source of income
it changed quite a lot because I was

6474
01:48:10,430 --> 01:48:10,440
it changed quite a lot because I was
 

6475
01:48:10,440 --> 01:48:11,510
it changed quite a lot because I was
really incentivized to have repeat

6476
01:48:11,510 --> 01:48:11,520
really incentivized to have repeat
 

6477

I'm going to express yeah um and
obviously it's to some degree like

6496
01:48:29,689 --> 01:48:29,699
obviously it's to some degree like
 

6497
01:48:29,699 --> 01:48:31,910
obviously it's to some degree like
titrated you know like I it's unpleasant

6498
01:48:31,910 --> 01:48:31,920
titrated you know like I it's unpleasant
 

6499
01:48:31,920 --> 01:48:33,290
titrated you know like I it's unpleasant
to force yourself to like something that

6500
01:48:33,290 --> 01:48:33,300
to force yourself to like something that
 

6501
01:48:33,300 --> 01:48:35,149
to force yourself to like something that
you don't so like I would actually like

6502
01:48:35,149 --> 01:48:35,159
you don't so like I would actually like
 

6503
01:48:35,159 --> 01:48:36,649

not see clients again that I didn't want

6504
01:48:36,649 --> 01:48:36,659
not see clients again that I didn't want
 

6505
01:48:36,659 --> 01:48:38,629
not see clients again that I didn't want
to but it's just some degree there was a

6506
01:48:38,629 --> 01:48:38,639
to but it's just some degree there was a
 

6507
01:48:38,639 --> 01:48:39,890
to but it's just some degree there was a
sort of self-suppression going on which

6508
01:48:39,890 --> 01:48:39,900
sort of self-suppression going on which
 

6509
01:48:39,900 --> 01:48:41,689
sort of self-suppression going on which
I think is this the way it works in any

6510
01:48:41,689 --> 01:48:41,699
I think is this the way it works in any

brain into like having it actually be

6640
01:50:37,250 --> 01:50:37,260
brain into like having it actually be
 

6641
01:50:37,260 --> 01:50:39,070
brain into like having it actually be
incentivizing for me

6642
01:50:39,070 --> 01:50:39,080
incentivizing for me
 

6643
01:50:39,080 --> 01:50:41,390
incentivizing for me
like China or something yeah like the

6644
01:50:41,390 --> 01:50:41,400
like China or something yeah like the
 

6645
01:50:41,400 --> 01:50:42,590
like China or something yeah like the
homeless man bought me a coffee and then

6646
01:50:42,590 --> 01:50:42,600
homeless man bought me a coffee and then
 

6647
01:50:42,600 --> 01:50:44,530

6649
01:50:44,540 --> 01:50:47,510
I sucked this dick like that's not cool
all right so no shade of homeless man by

6650
01:50:47,510 --> 01:50:47,520
all right so no shade of homeless man by
 

6651
01:50:47,520 --> 01:50:48,649
all right so no shade of homeless man by
the way like I've been friends with a

6652
01:50:48,649 --> 01:50:48,659
the way like I've been friends with a
 

6653
01:50:48,659 --> 01:50:49,910
the way like I've been friends with a
lot of them I'm just using like some

6654
01:50:49,910 --> 01:50:49,920
lot of them I'm just using like some
 

6655
01:50:49,920 --> 01:50:53,689
lot of them I'm just using like some
sort of stereotype of yeah right now so

6656
01:50:53,689 --> 01:50:53,699
sort of stereotype of yeah right now so
 

6657
01:50:53,699 --> 01:50:55,250
sort of stereotype of yeah right now so
like it has to be plausible where you

6658
01:50:55,250 --> 01:50:55,260
like it has to be plausible where you
 

6659
01:50:55,260 --> 01:50:57,350

mean yeah
and so that's different so now now with

6664
01:51:00,950 --> 01:51:00,960
and so that's different so now now with
 

6665

more demanding

6682
01:51:18,229 --> 01:51:18,239
more demanding

amorphous fear
 

7109
01:58:40,860 --> 01:58:42,709
amorphous fear
of failure

of failure
 

7111
01:58:42,719 --> 01:58:49,729
of failure
what it would actually look like

01:58:49,729 --> 01:58:49,739

 

7113
01:58:49,739 --> 01:58:51,830

maybe because we're talking about

maybe because we're talking about
 

7115
01:58:51,840 --> 01:58:54,470
maybe because we're talking about
sexuality me not being able to

7125
01:59:03,300 --> 01:59:04,910

that would make me feel like a failure

7126
01:59:04,910 --> 01:59:04,920
that would make me feel like a failure
 

7127
01:59:04,920 --> 01:59:06,109

because that would make me feel like
maybe you don't know what you're doing

7130
01:59:08,089 --> 01:59:08,099
maybe you don't know what you're doing
 

7131
01:59:08,099 --> 01:59:10,550
maybe you don't know what you're doing
right because sex sexuality and not

7132
01:59:10,550 --> 01:59:10,560
right because sex sexuality and not
 

7133
01:59:10,560 --> 01:59:11,930
right because sex sexuality and not
sexuality which is even romantic

7134
01:59:11,930 --> 01:59:11,940
sexuality which is even romantic
 

7135
01:59:11,940 --> 01:59:13,970
sexuality which is even romantic
relationships are really important to

7136
01:59:13,970 --> 01:59:13,980
relationships are really important to
 

7137
01:59:13,980 --> 01:59:15,830
relationships are really important to
happiness to they're really important to

7138
01:59:15,830 --> 01:59:15,840
happiness to they're really important to
 

7139
01:59:15,840 --> 01:59:17,870
happiness to they're really important to
me and I'm not sure like the conception

7140
01:59:17,870 --> 01:59:17,880
me and I'm not sure like the conception
 

7141
01:59:17,880 --> 01:59:20,810
me and I'm not sure like the conception
of love I have romantic love

7142
01:59:20,810 --> 01:59:20,820
of love I have romantic love
 

7143
01:59:20,820 --> 01:59:23,629
of love I have romantic love
is like fully um

7144
01:59:23,629 --> 01:59:23,639
is like fully um
 

7145
01:59:23,639 --> 01:59:25,850
is like fully um
made rigorous so especially when I'm

7146
01:59:25,850 --> 01:59:25,860
made rigorous so especially when I'm
 

7147
01:59:25,860 --> 01:59:27,470
made rigorous so especially when I'm
talking to you that thinks very

7148
01:59:27,470 --> 01:59:27,480
talking to you that thinks very
 

7149
01:59:27,480 --> 01:59:28,970
talking to you that thinks very
rigorously about a lot of these topics

7150
01:59:28,970 --> 01:59:28,980
rigorously about a lot of these topics
 

7151
01:59:28,980 --> 01:59:31,910
rigorously about a lot of these topics
I'm not sure if I've thought about them

7152
01:59:31,910 --> 01:59:31,920
I'm not sure if I've thought about them
 

7153
01:59:31,920 --> 01:59:34,850
I'm not sure if I've thought about them
a lot I feel them I interact with the

7154
01:59:34,850 --> 01:59:34,860
a lot I feel them I interact with the
 

7155
01:59:34,860 --> 01:59:36,709
a lot I feel them I interact with the
world in this base of feelings

7156
01:59:36,709 --> 01:59:36,719
world in this base of feelings
 

7157
01:59:36,719 --> 01:59:39,350
world in this base of feelings
maybe I'm almost afraid to be very

7158
01:59:39,350 --> 01:59:39,360
maybe I'm almost afraid to be very
 

7159
01:59:39,360 --> 01:59:41,930
maybe I'm almost afraid to be very
rigorous with these kinds of thoughts

7160
01:59:41,930 --> 01:59:41,940
rigorous with these kinds of thoughts
 

7161
01:59:41,940 --> 01:59:44,810
rigorous with these kinds of thoughts
and so I think

7162
01:59:44,810 --> 01:59:44,820
and so I think
 

7163
01:59:44,820 --> 01:59:47,030
and so I think
the the failure would be like I would be

7164
01:59:47,030 --> 01:59:47,040
the the failure would be like I would be
 

7165
01:59:47,040 --> 01:59:48,350
the the failure would be like I would be
confronted with the fact that I can't

logic that you're using to make sense of
the world should be fitted into that

7322
02:02:31,550 --> 02:02:31,560
the world should be fitted into that
 

7323
02:02:31,560 --> 02:02:33,950
the world should be fitted into that
correctly I think it's really cool like

7324
02:02:33,950 --> 02:02:33,960
correctly I think it's really cool like
 

7325
02:02:33,960 --> 02:02:35,089
correctly I think it's really cool like
anytime you have sort of like an

7326
02:02:35,089 --> 02:02:35,099
anytime you have sort of like an
 

7327
02:02:35,099 --> 02:02:36,890
anytime you have sort of like an
internal at odds thing with it I think

7328
02:02:36,890 --> 02:02:36,900
internal at odds thing with it I think
 

7329
02:02:36,900 --> 02:02:38,750
internal at odds thing with it I think
you're like using some sort of force to

7330
02:02:38,750 --> 02:02:38,760
you're like using some sort of force to
 

7331
02:02:38,760 --> 02:02:40,250
you're like using some sort of force to
suppress one or the other like I'm not

7332
02:02:40,250 --> 02:02:40,260
suppress one or the other like I'm not
 

7333
02:02:40,260 --> 02:02:41,570
suppress one or the other like I'm not
allowed to reason about this or I'm not

7334
02:02:41,570 --> 02:02:41,580
allowed to reason about this or I'm not
 

7335
02:02:41,580 --> 02:02:43,250
allowed to reason about this or I'm not
allowed to feel about that and it feels

7336
02:02:43,250 --> 02:02:43,260
allowed to feel about that and it feels
 

7337
02:02:43,260 --> 02:02:45,229
allowed to feel about that and it feels
harsh to me and I think curiosity is the

7338
02:02:45,229 --> 02:02:45,239
harsh to me and I think curiosity is the
 

7339
02:02:45,239 --> 02:02:47,270
harsh to me and I think curiosity is the
solution like if you if you're simply

7340
02:02:47,270 --> 02:02:47,280
solution like if you if you're simply
 

7341
02:02:47,280 --> 02:02:49,910
solution like if you if you're simply
just calmly curious oh why do I feel

7342
02:02:49,910 --> 02:02:49,920
just calmly curious oh why do I feel
 

7343
02:02:49,920 --> 02:02:52,070
just calmly curious oh why do I feel
like that let's let's go find out that's

7344
02:02:52,070 --> 02:02:52,080
like that let's let's go find out that's
 

7345
02:02:52,080 --> 02:02:54,890
like that let's let's go find out that's
so cool right like you can use logic and

7346
02:02:54,890 --> 02:02:54,900
so cool right like you can use logic and
 

7347
02:02:54,900 --> 02:02:56,209
so cool right like you can use logic and
your feelings to like discover the

7348
02:02:56,209 --> 02:02:56,219
your feelings to like discover the
 

7349
02:02:56,219 --> 02:02:57,169
your feelings to like discover the
answer

7350
02:02:57,169 --> 02:02:57,179
answer
 

7351
02:02:57,179 --> 02:02:59,390
answer
do you sometimes because you do this

7352
02:02:59,390 --> 02:02:59,400
do you sometimes because you do this
 

7353
02:02:59,400 --> 02:03:00,589
do you sometimes because you do this
kind of technique which is interesting

7354
02:03:00,589 --> 02:03:00,599
kind of technique which is interesting
 

7355
02:03:00,599 --> 02:03:02,870
kind of technique which is interesting
and I've mentioned it to others you'll

7356
02:03:02,870 --> 02:03:02,880
and I've mentioned it to others you'll
 

7357
02:03:02,880 --> 02:03:04,250
and I've mentioned it to others you'll
sometimes step away from like a third

7358
02:03:04,250 --> 02:03:04,260
sometimes step away from like a third
 

7359
02:03:04,260 --> 02:03:06,229
sometimes step away from like a third
person perspective and describe the

7360
02:03:06,229 --> 02:03:06,239
person perspective and describe the
 

7361
02:03:06,239 --> 02:03:08,390
person perspective and describe the
feeling you're feeling

7362
02:03:08,390 --> 02:03:08,400
feeling you're feeling
 

7363
02:03:08,400 --> 02:03:10,250
feeling you're feeling
or like even just the situation like

7364
02:03:10,250 --> 02:03:10,260
or like even just the situation like
 

7365
02:03:10,260 --> 02:03:11,629
or like even just the situation like
you'll step out

7366
02:03:11,629 --> 02:03:11,639
you'll step out
 

7367
02:03:11,639 --> 02:03:14,089
you'll step out
and talk about wait what is happening

7368
02:03:14,089 --> 02:03:14,099
and talk about wait what is happening
 

7369
02:03:14,099 --> 02:03:16,370
and talk about wait what is happening
here like in the conversation in the

7370
02:03:16,370 --> 02:03:16,380
here like in the conversation in the
 

7371
02:03:16,380 --> 02:03:19,250
here like in the conversation in the
conversation itself yeah uh first off

7372
02:03:19,250 --> 02:03:19,260
conversation itself yeah uh first off
 

7373
02:03:19,260 --> 02:03:21,109
conversation itself yeah uh first off
what is that was that do you find that

7374
02:03:21,109 --> 02:03:21,119
what is that was that do you find that
 

7375
02:03:21,119 --> 02:03:22,250
what is that was that do you find that
to be useful and interesting because

7376
02:03:22,250 --> 02:03:22,260
to be useful and interesting because
 

7377
02:03:22,260 --> 02:03:25,070
to be useful and interesting because
it's it's very interesting it feels raw

7378
02:03:25,070 --> 02:03:25,080
it's it's very interesting it feels raw
 

7379
02:03:25,080 --> 02:03:27,530
it's it's very interesting it feels raw
and honest the danger of it seems like

7380
02:03:27,530 --> 02:03:27,540
and honest the danger of it seems like
 

7381
02:03:27,540 --> 02:03:29,089
and honest the danger of it seems like
you escape

7382
02:03:29,089 --> 02:03:29,099
you escape
 

7383
02:03:29,099 --> 02:03:31,550
you escape
the actual experience of it though

7384
02:03:31,550 --> 02:03:31,560
the actual experience of it though
 

7385
02:03:31,560 --> 02:03:33,169
the actual experience of it though
so that's the trade-off

7386
02:03:33,169 --> 02:03:33,179
so that's the trade-off
 

7387
02:03:33,179 --> 02:03:35,890
so that's the trade-off
you make it intellectual right

7388
02:03:35,890 --> 02:03:35,900
you make it intellectual right
 

7389
02:03:35,900 --> 02:03:39,770
you make it intellectual right
though intellectual to do that

7390
02:03:39,770 --> 02:03:39,780
though intellectual to do that
 

7391
02:03:39,780 --> 02:03:42,589
though intellectual to do that
I mean maybe it is I don't mean to

7392
02:03:42,589 --> 02:03:42,599
I mean maybe it is I don't mean to
 

7393
02:03:42,599 --> 02:03:44,810
I mean maybe it is I don't mean to
no maybe this wrong word

7394
02:03:44,810 --> 02:03:44,820
no maybe this wrong word
 

7395
02:03:44,820 --> 02:03:46,729
no maybe this wrong word
you can make it intellectual yeah but

7396
02:03:46,729 --> 02:03:46,739
you can make it intellectual yeah but
 

7397
02:03:46,739 --> 02:03:48,410
you can make it intellectual yeah but
you can still continue the same flavor

7398
02:03:48,410 --> 02:03:48,420
you can still continue the same flavor
 

7399
02:03:48,420 --> 02:03:50,270
you can still continue the same flavor
because you're not fully disengaging

7400
02:03:50,270 --> 02:03:50,280
because you're not fully disengaging
 

7401
02:03:50,280 --> 02:03:51,830
because you're not fully disengaging
from the conversation

7402
02:03:51,830 --> 02:03:51,840
from the conversation
 

7403
02:03:51,840 --> 02:03:53,629
from the conversation
you're doing you're just creating an

7404
02:03:53,629 --> 02:03:53,639
you're doing you're just creating an
 

7405
02:03:53,639 --> 02:03:56,149
you're doing you're just creating an
extra metal layer yeah that's happening

7406
02:03:56,149 --> 02:03:56,159
extra metal layer yeah that's happening
 

7407
02:03:56,159 --> 02:03:57,890
extra metal layer yeah that's happening
exploring the emotional reaction to

7408
02:03:57,890 --> 02:03:57,900
exploring the emotional reaction to
 

7409
02:03:57,900 --> 02:04:00,470
exploring the emotional reaction to
what's going on in the moment yeah yeah

7410
02:04:00,470 --> 02:04:00,480
what's going on in the moment yeah yeah
 

7411
02:04:00,480 --> 02:04:01,850
what's going on in the moment yeah yeah
in some way it's actually making a

7412
02:04:01,850 --> 02:04:01,860
in some way it's actually making a
 

7413
02:04:01,860 --> 02:04:05,689
in some way it's actually making a
stronger like or enriching it like

7414
02:04:05,689 --> 02:04:05,699
stronger like or enriching it like
 

7415
02:04:05,699 --> 02:04:07,250
stronger like or enriching it like
making it more

7416
02:04:07,250 --> 02:04:07,260
making it more
 

7417
02:04:07,260 --> 02:04:10,370
making it more
uh yeah giving him more context giving a

7418
02:04:10,370 --> 02:04:10,380
uh yeah giving him more context giving a
 

7419
02:04:10,380 --> 02:04:11,750
uh yeah giving him more context giving a
deeper understanding I think there's

7420
02:04:11,750 --> 02:04:11,760
deeper understanding I think there's
 

7421
02:04:11,760 --> 02:04:13,669
deeper understanding I think there's
like a way of going meta that is is a

7422
02:04:13,669 --> 02:04:13,679
like a way of going meta that is is a
 

7423
02:04:13,679 --> 02:04:15,410
like a way of going meta that is is a
Flinch move like oh I noticed that we're

7424
02:04:15,410 --> 02:04:15,420
Flinch move like oh I noticed that we're
 

7425
02:04:15,420 --> 02:04:16,790
Flinch move like oh I noticed that we're
doing this thing I'm going to name it

7426
02:04:16,790 --> 02:04:16,800
doing this thing I'm going to name it
 

7427
02:04:16,800 --> 02:04:18,290
doing this thing I'm going to name it
and I think the thing that I described

7428
02:04:18,290 --> 02:04:18,300
and I think the thing that I described
 

7429
02:04:18,300 --> 02:04:19,430
and I think the thing that I described
earlier like when the homeless guy

7430
02:04:19,430 --> 02:04:19,440
earlier like when the homeless guy
 

7431
02:04:19,440 --> 02:04:21,350
earlier like when the homeless guy
approached me and asked you know can you

7432
02:04:21,350 --> 02:04:21,360
approached me and asked you know can you
 

7433
02:04:21,360 --> 02:04:23,390
approached me and asked you know can you
go home with me and I was like are you

7434
02:04:23,390 --> 02:04:23,400
go home with me and I was like are you
 

7435
02:04:23,400 --> 02:04:24,410
go home with me and I was like are you
trying to have sex with me right now

7436
02:04:24,410 --> 02:04:24,420
trying to have sex with me right now
 

7437
02:04:24,420 --> 02:04:25,729
trying to have sex with me right now
like what I was doing is like a meta

7438
02:04:25,729 --> 02:04:25,739
like what I was doing is like a meta
 

7439
02:04:25,739 --> 02:04:26,930
like what I was doing is like a meta
like you're stepping outside like and

7440
02:04:26,930 --> 02:04:26,940
like you're stepping outside like and
 

7441
02:04:26,940 --> 02:04:28,430
like you're stepping outside like and
like okay what is the purpose of this

7442
02:04:28,430 --> 02:04:28,440
like okay what is the purpose of this
 

7443
02:04:28,440 --> 02:04:29,990
like okay what is the purpose of this
conversation we explicitly identify it

7444
02:04:29,990 --> 02:04:30,000
conversation we explicitly identify it
 

7445
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:31,490
conversation we explicitly identify it
and in that case I think that is sort of

7446
02:04:31,490 --> 02:04:31,500
and in that case I think that is sort of
 

7447
02:04:31,500 --> 02:04:34,790
and in that case I think that is sort of
like a Flinch move like I'm not telling

7448
02:04:34,790 --> 02:04:34,800
like a Flinch move like I'm not telling
 

7449
02:04:34,800 --> 02:04:36,290
like a Flinch move like I'm not telling
him my emotional response I'm not like

7450
02:04:36,290 --> 02:04:36,300
him my emotional response I'm not like
 

7451
02:04:36,300 --> 02:04:38,270
him my emotional response I'm not like
being fully present I'm like sort of

7452
02:04:38,270 --> 02:04:38,280
being fully present I'm like sort of
 

7453
02:04:38,280 --> 02:04:40,250
being fully present I'm like sort of
identifying it as a way to subvert

7454
02:04:40,250 --> 02:04:40,260
identifying it as a way to subvert
 

7455
02:04:40,260 --> 02:04:41,930
identifying it as a way to subvert
what's going on and so I absolutely

7456
02:04:41,930 --> 02:04:41,940
what's going on and so I absolutely
 

7457
02:04:41,940 --> 02:04:44,149
what's going on and so I absolutely
think this is a possible thing uh but I

7458
02:04:44,149 --> 02:04:44,159
think this is a possible thing uh but I
 

7459
02:04:44,159 --> 02:04:45,530
think this is a possible thing uh but I
usually try to be aware of that myself

7460
02:04:45,530 --> 02:04:45,540
usually try to be aware of that myself
 

7461
02:04:45,540 --> 02:04:46,790
usually try to be aware of that myself
it depends on the purpose of what's

7462
02:04:46,790 --> 02:04:46,800
it depends on the purpose of what's
 

7463
02:04:46,800 --> 02:04:48,770
it depends on the purpose of what's
going on that guy because that is

7464
02:04:48,770 --> 02:04:48,780
going on that guy because that is
 

7465
02:04:48,780 --> 02:04:50,990
going on that guy because that is
actually like a chess move you did you

7466
02:04:50,990 --> 02:04:51,000
actually like a chess move you did you
 

7467
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:52,669
actually like a chess move you did you
had a purpose with that chest move but

7468
02:04:52,669 --> 02:04:52,679
had a purpose with that chest move but
 

7469
02:04:52,679 --> 02:04:54,350
had a purpose with that chest move but
the flirtation is on

7470
02:04:54,350 --> 02:04:54,360
the flirtation is on
 

7471
02:04:54,360 --> 02:04:56,209
the flirtation is on
like he could have

7472
02:04:56,209 --> 02:04:56,219
like he could have
 

7473
02:04:56,219 --> 02:04:59,149
like he could have
like uh done a better move

7474
02:04:59,149 --> 02:04:59,159
like uh done a better move
 

7475
02:04:59,159 --> 02:05:01,070
like uh done a better move
that would make you like Curious like

7476
02:05:01,070 --> 02:05:01,080

play with the same or like this circling
 

7519
02:05:48,719 --> 02:05:50,570
play with the same or like this circling
it's just a practice explicitly

7520
02:05:50,570 --> 02:05:50,580
it's just a practice explicitly
 

7521
02:05:50,580 --> 02:05:52,070
it's just a practice explicitly
dedicated towards that what circling

7522
02:05:52,070 --> 02:05:52,080
dedicated towards that what circling
 

7523
02:05:52,080 --> 02:05:53,810
dedicated towards that what circling
circling that might be the thing yeah I

7524

mutual circulars in our circles and our
 

7529
02:05:57,960 --> 02:05:59,990
mutual circulars in our circles and our
networks here what's uh what's circling

7530
02:05:59,990 --> 02:06:00,000
networks here what's uh what's circling
 

7531
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:01,910
networks here what's uh what's circling

being that is also I mean yeah with

7808
02:10:14,149 --> 02:10:14,159
being that is also I mean yeah with
 

7809
02:10:14,159 --> 02:10:16,790
being that is also I mean yeah with
polyamory It's Tricky and your

7810
02:10:16,790 --> 02:10:16,800
polyamory It's Tricky and your
 

7811

and that and a friendship that also has
a sexual component I remember being very

7820
02:10:28,129 --> 02:10:28,139
a sexual component I remember being very
 

7821
02:10:28,139 --> 02:10:29,330
a sexual component I remember being very
confused about that when I did a lot of

7822
02:10:29,330 --> 02:10:29,340
confused about that when I did a lot of
 

7823
02:10:29,340 --> 02:10:32,689
confused about that when I did a lot of
LSD I was like what uh the the line

7824
02:10:32,689 --> 02:10:32,699
LSD I was like what uh the the line
 

7825
02:10:32,699 --> 02:10:34,129
LSD I was like what uh the the line
between romantic relationships and

7826
02:10:34,129 --> 02:10:34,139
between romantic relationships and
 

7827
02:10:34,139 --> 02:10:35,570
between romantic relationships and
everything else kind of got blurred I

7828
02:10:35,570 --> 02:10:35,580
everything else kind of got blurred I
 

7829
02:10:35,580 --> 02:10:37,189
everything else kind of got blurred I
was like oh I'm just like in intimacy

7830
02:10:37,189 --> 02:10:37,199
was like oh I'm just like in intimacy
 

7831
02:10:37,199 --> 02:10:39,470
was like oh I'm just like in intimacy
and some intimacies mean that you spend

7832
02:10:39,470 --> 02:10:39,480
and some intimacies mean that you spend
 

7833
02:10:39,480 --> 02:10:41,089
and some intimacies mean that you spend
your life together more and have sex but

7834
02:10:41,089 --> 02:10:41,099
your life together more and have sex but
 

7835
02:10:41,099 --> 02:10:41,930
your life together more and have sex but
like

7836
02:10:41,930 --> 02:10:41,940
like
 

7837
02:10:41,940 --> 02:10:44,629
like
and the the same basic thing is there

7838
02:10:44,629 --> 02:10:44,639
and the the same basic thing is there
 

7839
02:10:44,639 --> 02:10:46,550
and the the same basic thing is there
like you're seeing someone for like who

7840
02:10:46,550 --> 02:10:46,560
like you're seeing someone for like who
 

7841
02:10:46,560 --> 02:10:47,510
like you're seeing someone for like who
they are

7842
02:10:47,510 --> 02:10:47,520
they are
 

7843
02:10:47,520 --> 02:10:49,129
they are
do you think you can be if you're

7844
02:10:49,129 --> 02:10:49,139
do you think you can be if you're
 

7845
02:10:49,139 --> 02:10:50,810
do you think you can be if you're
heterosexual do you think it could be

7846
02:10:50,810 --> 02:10:50,820
heterosexual do you think it could be
 

7847
02:10:50,820 --> 02:10:53,149
heterosexual do you think it could be
really deeply close with friends with a

7848
02:10:53,149 --> 02:10:53,159
really deeply close with friends with a
 

7849
02:10:53,159 --> 02:10:55,310
really deeply close with friends with a
guy and not have sexual relationships

7850
02:10:55,310 --> 02:10:55,320
guy and not have sexual relationships
 

7851
02:10:55,320 --> 02:10:58,490
guy and not have sexual relationships
with him I assume it's possible like if

7852
02:10:58,490 --> 02:10:58,500
with him I assume it's possible like if
 

7853
02:10:58,500 --> 02:11:00,290
with him I assume it's possible like if
anything is ever possible then probably

7854
02:11:00,290 --> 02:11:00,300
anything is ever possible then probably
 

7855
02:11:00,300 --> 02:11:01,490
anything is ever possible then probably
yeah

7856
02:11:01,490 --> 02:11:01,500
yeah
 

7857
02:11:01,500 --> 02:11:03,770
yeah
like everything is possible time travel

7858
02:11:03,770 --> 02:11:03,780
like everything is possible time travel
 

7859
02:11:03,780 --> 02:11:05,810
like everything is possible time travel
is possible quantum mechanics makes

7860
02:11:05,810 --> 02:11:05,820
is possible quantum mechanics makes
 

7861
02:11:05,820 --> 02:11:07,790
is possible quantum mechanics makes
every traveling faster than the speed of

7862
02:11:07,790 --> 02:11:07,800
every traveling faster than the speed of
 

7863
02:11:07,800 --> 02:11:09,649
every traveling faster than the speed of
light is possible according general

7864
02:11:09,649 --> 02:11:09,659
light is possible according general
 

7865
02:11:09,659 --> 02:11:12,169
light is possible according general
relativity everything's possible so

7866
02:11:12,169 --> 02:11:12,179
relativity everything's possible so
 

7867
02:11:12,179 --> 02:11:14,050
relativity everything's possible so
you're saying there's a chance sometimes

7868
02:11:14,050 --> 02:11:14,060
you're saying there's a chance sometimes
 

7869
02:11:14,060 --> 02:11:16,370
you're saying there's a chance sometimes
taught me that everything it's probably

7870
02:11:16,370 --> 02:11:16,380
taught me that everything it's probably
 

7871
02:11:16,380 --> 02:11:18,770
taught me that everything it's probably
impossible not super likely assuming

7872
02:11:18,770 --> 02:11:18,780
impossible not super likely assuming
 

7873
02:11:18,780 --> 02:11:20,149
impossible not super likely assuming
that they are like attracted to each

7874
02:11:20,149 --> 02:11:20,159
that they are like attracted to each
 

7875
02:11:20,159 --> 02:11:22,129
that they are like attracted to each
other yeah

7876
02:11:22,129 --> 02:11:22,139
other yeah
 

7877
02:11:22,139 --> 02:11:24,169
other yeah
and for somebody that has surveys and

7878
02:11:24,169 --> 02:11:24,179
and for somebody that has surveys and
 

7879
02:11:24,179 --> 02:11:26,810
and for somebody that has surveys and
statistical analysis

7880
02:11:26,810 --> 02:11:26,820
statistical analysis
 

7881
02:11:26,820 --> 02:11:28,910
statistical analysis
we're interested in like what's the

7882
02:11:28,910 --> 02:11:28,920
we're interested in like what's the
 

7883
02:11:28,920 --> 02:11:30,709
we're interested in like what's the
likely thing here versus like what's

7884
02:11:30,709 --> 02:11:30,719
likely thing here versus like what's
 

7885
02:11:30,719 --> 02:11:32,089
likely thing here versus like what's
possible if you say possible it's like

7886
02:11:32,089 --> 02:11:32,099
possible if you say possible it's like
 

7887
02:11:32,099 --> 02:11:34,310
possible if you say possible it's like
where anything's open did you just avoid

7888
02:11:34,310 --> 02:11:34,320
where anything's open did you just avoid

7901
02:11:47,699 --> 02:11:49,550

it feels like a passive aggressive

7902
02:11:49,550 --> 02:11:49,560
it feels like a passive aggressive
 

7903
02:11:49,560 --> 02:11:50,930
it feels like a passive aggressive
suggestion that we shouldn't talk about

7904
02:11:50,930 --> 02:11:50,940
suggestion that we shouldn't talk about

sparkle thing that I get in my stomach
 

7919
02:12:02,880 --> 02:12:04,790
sparkle thing that I get in my stomach

study relationships over time I just
 

7923
02:12:06,420 --> 02:12:08,390
study relationships over time I just
really like I did a survey about it and

7924
02:12:08,390 --> 02:12:08,400
really like I did a survey about it and
 

7925
02:12:08,400 --> 02:12:09,950
really like I did a survey about it and
that sparkle goes away within like two

7926
02:12:09,950 --> 02:12:09,960
that sparkle goes away within like two
 

7927
02:12:09,960 --> 02:12:11,930
that sparkle goes away within like two
to four years but people still report

7928
02:12:11,930 --> 02:12:11,940

8961
02:29:02,220 --> 02:29:04,190
in that way yeah absolutely but I just
don't see monogamy as like this

8962

don't see monogamy as like this
 

8963
02:29:04,200 --> 02:29:06,889
don't see monogamy as like this
definitely not a default I would

actually like honestly would probably
see polyamory as a more natural default

8968
02:29:12,349 --> 02:29:12,359
see polyamory as a more natural default
 

8969

8971
02:29:13,859 --> 02:29:15,530
yeah I mean I guess it depends on what
you mean by default like most of human

8972
02:29:15,530 --> 02:29:15,540

but it's so cool to me that like human
 

9365
02:36:34,439 --> 02:36:35,750
but it's so cool to me that like human
brains could be oriented in such a way

9366
02:36:35,750 --> 02:36:35,760
brains could be oriented in such a way
 

9367
02:36:35,760 --> 02:36:37,150
brains could be oriented in such a way
like like wound [\h__\h] like like

so cool
yeah and then they probably and it

9374
02:36:44,510 --> 02:36:44,520
yeah and then they probably and it
 

9375
02:36:44,520 --> 02:36:46,010
yeah and then they probably and it
should be explored like how did that

9376
02:36:46,010 --> 02:36:46,020
should be explored like how did that
 

9377
02:36:46,020 --> 02:36:48,530
should be explored like how did that
come to be you mentioned that we like to

9378
02:36:48,530 --> 02:36:48,540
come to be you mentioned that we like to
 

9379
02:36:48,540 --> 02:36:49,849
come to be you mentioned that we like to
construct narratives that somehow was

9380
02:36:49,849 --> 02:36:49,859
construct narratives that somehow was
 

9381
02:36:49,859 --> 02:36:51,469
construct narratives that somehow was
grounded in childhood but maybe it's

9382
02:36:51,469 --> 02:36:51,479
grounded in childhood but maybe it's
 

9383
02:36:51,479 --> 02:36:53,870
grounded in childhood but maybe it's
genetic maybe it has to do with maybe

9384
02:36:53,870 --> 02:36:53,880
genetic maybe it has to do with maybe
 

9385
02:36:53,880 --> 02:36:55,849
genetic maybe it has to do with maybe
you can actually form and unform that

9386
02:36:55,849 --> 02:36:55,859
you can actually form and unform that
 

9387
02:36:55,859 --> 02:36:59,150
you can actually form and unform that
fetish very quickly I don't know uh this

9388
02:36:59,150 --> 02:36:59,160
fetish very quickly I don't know uh this
 

9389
02:36:59,160 --> 02:37:00,110
fetish very quickly I don't know uh this
is one of the things that I'm

9390
02:37:00,110 --> 02:37:00,120
is one of the things that I'm
 

9391
02:37:00,120 --> 02:37:02,270
is one of the things that I'm
researching so in the big survey that

9392
02:37:02,270 --> 02:37:02,280
researching so in the big survey that
 

9393
02:37:02,280 --> 02:37:03,650
researching so in the big survey that
I'm doing I asked so many questions

9394
02:37:03,650 --> 02:37:03,660
I'm doing I asked so many questions
 

9395
02:37:03,660 --> 02:37:04,969
I'm doing I asked so many questions
about childhood all the ones that I

9396
02:37:04,969 --> 02:37:04,979
about childhood all the ones that I
 

9397
02:37:04,979 --> 02:37:07,130
about childhood all the ones that I
think like we have common theories about

9398
02:37:07,130 --> 02:37:07,140
think like we have common theories about

I asked you know obviously about like a
massive amount of fetishes and my sample

9414
02:37:20,990 --> 02:37:21,000
massive amount of fetishes and my sample
 

9415
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:23,630
massive amount of fetishes and my sample
size right now is 500 000 people 500

9417
02:37:23,640 --> 02:37:25,670
size right now is 500 000 people 500
yeah it's massive and I have stated for

9418
02:37:25,670 --> 02:37:25,680
yeah it's massive and I have stated for
 

9419
02:37:25,680 --> 02:37:28,010
yeah it's massive and I have stated for
all of it and the result looks like

9420
02:37:28,010 --> 02:37:28,020
all of it and the result looks like
 

9421
02:37:28,020 --> 02:37:29,990
all of it and the result looks like
that's not really correlated nothing

9422
02:37:29,990 --> 02:37:30,000

yeah one of the interesting things I

9452
02:38:08,870 --> 02:38:08,880
yeah one of the interesting things I
 

9453
02:38:08,880 --> 02:38:10,910
yeah one of the interesting things I
found I mean this data set's so huge

9454
02:38:10,910 --> 02:38:10,920
found I mean this data set's so huge
 

9455
02:38:10,920 --> 02:38:11,990
found I mean this data set's so huge
it's taking me a long time to go through

9456
02:38:11,990 --> 02:38:12,000
it's taking me a long time to go through
 

9457
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:13,730
it's taking me a long time to go through
it so this is like Snippets from what I

9458
02:38:13,730 --> 02:38:13,740
it so this is like Snippets from what I
 

9459
02:38:13,740 --> 02:38:14,750
it so this is like Snippets from what I
remember when I was glancing through the

9460
02:38:14,750 --> 02:38:14,760
remember when I was glancing through the
 

9461
02:38:14,760 --> 02:38:16,910
remember when I was glancing through the
data so this part is not rigorous but I

9462
02:38:16,910 --> 02:38:16,920
data so this part is not rigorous but I
 

9463
02:38:16,920 --> 02:38:19,250
data so this part is not rigorous but I
seem to get the impression that um if

9464
02:38:19,250 --> 02:38:19,260
seem to get the impression that um if
 

9465
02:38:19,260 --> 02:38:21,650
seem to get the impression that um if
you are if a fetish occurs for you

9466
02:38:21,650 --> 02:38:21,660
you are if a fetish occurs for you
 

9467
02:38:21,660 --> 02:38:23,090
you are if a fetish occurs for you
earlier like even much earlier onset

9468
02:38:23,090 --> 02:38:23,100
earlier like even much earlier onset
 

9469
02:38:23,100 --> 02:38:24,290
earlier like even much earlier onset
you're more likely to report being

9470
02:38:24,290 --> 02:38:24,300
you're more likely to report being
 

9471
02:38:24,300 --> 02:38:26,510
you're more likely to report being
extremely interested into it so later

9472
02:38:26,510 --> 02:38:26,520
extremely interested into it so later
 

9473
02:38:26,520 --> 02:38:28,010
extremely interested into it so later
onset means you're going to be like less

9474
02:38:28,010 --> 02:38:28,020
onset means you're going to be like less
 

9475
02:38:28,020 --> 02:38:30,290
onset means you're going to be like less
into the fetish but if it hits earlier

9476
02:38:30,290 --> 02:38:30,300
into the fetish but if it hits earlier
 

9477
02:38:30,300 --> 02:38:32,809
into the fetish but if it hits earlier
but I wonder if it passes like

9478
02:38:32,809 --> 02:38:32,819
but I wonder if it passes like
 

9479
02:38:32,819 --> 02:38:34,730
but I wonder if it passes like
it's really yeah I didn't measure old

9480
02:38:34,730 --> 02:38:34,740
it's really yeah I didn't measure old
 

9481
02:38:34,740 --> 02:38:36,349
it's really yeah I didn't measure old
fetishes at all

9482
02:38:36,349 --> 02:38:36,359
fetishes at all
 

9483
02:38:36,359 --> 02:38:39,950
fetishes at all
like no longer right you used to but it

9484
02:38:39,950 --> 02:38:39,960
like no longer right you used to but it
 

9485
02:38:39,960 --> 02:38:41,929
like no longer right you used to but it
is no longer there interesting one

9486
02:38:41,929 --> 02:38:41,939
is no longer there interesting one
 

9487
02:38:41,939 --> 02:38:42,830
is no longer there interesting one
interesting thing that I don't

9488
02:38:42,830 --> 02:38:42,840
interesting thing that I don't
 

9489
02:38:42,840 --> 02:38:45,710
interesting thing that I don't
understand is that um that uh non-cis

9490
02:38:45,710 --> 02:38:45,720
understand is that um that uh non-cis
 

9491
02:38:45,720 --> 02:38:47,270
understand is that um that uh non-cis
people seem to have more correlation

9492
02:38:47,270 --> 02:38:47,280
people seem to have more correlation
 

9493
02:38:47,280 --> 02:38:49,130
people seem to have more correlation
between childhood experiences and

9494
02:38:49,130 --> 02:38:49,140
between childhood experiences and
 

9495
02:38:49,140 --> 02:38:50,570
between childhood experiences and
fetishes so I was saying that there's no

9496
02:38:50,570 --> 02:38:50,580
fetishes so I was saying that there's no
 

9497
02:38:50,580 --> 02:38:52,010
fetishes so I was saying that there's no
correlation between childhood experience

9498
02:38:52,010 --> 02:38:52,020
correlation between childhood experience
 

9499
02:38:52,020 --> 02:38:54,230
correlation between childhood experience
divisions this holds for CIS people so

9500
02:38:54,230 --> 02:38:54,240
divisions this holds for CIS people so
 

9501
02:38:54,240 --> 02:38:55,910
divisions this holds for CIS people so
trans people specially trans men there's

9502
02:38:55,910 --> 02:38:55,920
trans people specially trans men there's
 

9503
02:38:55,920 --> 02:38:57,770
trans people specially trans men there's
a correlation it doesn't mean they have

9504
02:38:57,770 --> 02:38:57,780
a correlation it doesn't mean they have
 

9505
02:38:57,780 --> 02:38:59,330
a correlation it doesn't mean they have
absolutely higher rates of abuse or

9506
02:38:59,330 --> 02:38:59,340
absolutely higher rates of abuse or
 

9507
02:38:59,340 --> 02:39:01,130
absolutely higher rates of abuse or
fetishes or anything but I'm just saying

9508
02:39:01,130 --> 02:39:01,140
fetishes or anything but I'm just saying
 

9509
02:39:01,140 --> 02:39:02,990
fetishes or anything but I'm just saying
that like for them there does actually

9510
02:39:02,990 --> 02:39:03,000
that like for them there does actually
 

9511
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:04,070
that like for them there does actually
seem to be some sort of connection

9512
02:39:04,070 --> 02:39:04,080
seem to be some sort of connection
 

9513
02:39:04,080 --> 02:39:05,630
seem to be some sort of connection
between childhood experiences and

9514
02:39:05,630 --> 02:39:05,640
between childhood experiences and
 

9515
02:39:05,640 --> 02:39:07,190
between childhood experiences and
sexuality later in life and I don't

9516
02:39:07,190 --> 02:39:07,200
sexuality later in life and I don't
 

9517
02:39:07,200 --> 02:39:08,690
sexuality later in life and I don't
understand why this applies to one group

9518
02:39:08,690 --> 02:39:08,700
understand why this applies to one group
 

9519
02:39:08,700 --> 02:39:09,770
understand why this applies to one group
but not the other I don't have a good

9520
02:39:09,770 --> 02:39:09,780
but not the other I don't have a good
 

9521
02:39:09,780 --> 02:39:11,750
but not the other I don't have a good
theory for that so usually you try like

9522
02:39:11,750 --> 02:39:11,760
theory for that so usually you try like
 

9523
02:39:11,760 --> 02:39:13,070
theory for that so usually you try like
when you see something like that you'll

9524
02:39:13,070 --> 02:39:13,080
when you see something like that you'll
 

9525
02:39:13,080 --> 02:39:14,809
when you see something like that you'll
try to construct Theory and see if you

9526
02:39:14,809 --> 02:39:14,819
try to construct Theory and see if you
 

9527
02:39:14,819 --> 02:39:16,730
try to construct Theory and see if you
can find like

9528
02:39:16,730 --> 02:39:16,740
can find like
 

9529
02:39:16,740 --> 02:39:18,950
can find like
you keep that theory in mind like a

9530
02:39:18,950 --> 02:39:18,960
you keep that theory in mind like a
 

9531
02:39:18,960 --> 02:39:20,929
you keep that theory in mind like a
hypothesis of why it would be and then

9532
02:39:20,929 --> 02:39:20,939
hypothesis of why it would be and then
 

9533
02:39:20,939 --> 02:39:23,090
hypothesis of why it would be and then
you ask further questions to try to

9534
02:39:23,090 --> 02:39:23,100
you ask further questions to try to
 

9535
02:39:23,100 --> 02:39:24,590
you ask further questions to try to
elaborate

9536
02:39:24,590 --> 02:39:24,600
elaborate
 

9537
02:39:24,600 --> 02:39:26,090
elaborate
so can you maybe talk about the

9538
02:39:26,090 --> 02:39:26,100
so can you maybe talk about the
 

9539
02:39:26,100 --> 02:39:27,950
so can you maybe talk about the
methodology of how you got the 500 000

9540
02:39:27,950 --> 02:39:27,960
methodology of how you got the 500 000
 

9541
02:39:27,960 --> 02:39:29,150
methodology of how you got the 500 000
like what

9542
02:39:29,150 --> 02:39:29,160
like what
 

9543
02:39:29,160 --> 02:39:32,510
like what
uh like how did this come to be yeah

9544
02:39:32,510 --> 02:39:32,520
uh like how did this come to be yeah
 

9545
02:39:32,520 --> 02:39:34,370
uh like how did this come to be yeah
this is I might go into way too much

9546
02:39:34,370 --> 02:39:34,380
this is I might go into way too much
 

9547
02:39:34,380 --> 02:39:35,389
this is I might go into way too much
detail about this because I thought

9548
02:39:35,389 --> 02:39:35,399
detail about this because I thought
 

9549
02:39:35,399 --> 02:39:37,010
detail about this because I thought
about this so much yeah because I'm like

9550
02:39:37,010 --> 02:39:37,020
about this so much yeah because I'm like
 

9551
02:39:37,020 --> 02:39:38,750
about this so much yeah because I'm like
the question is how do you get a lot of

9552
02:39:38,750 --> 02:39:38,760
the question is how do you get a lot of
 

9553
02:39:38,760 --> 02:39:41,030
the question is how do you get a lot of
people to take a big survey the longer

9554
02:39:41,030 --> 02:39:41,040
people to take a big survey the longer
 

9555
02:39:41,040 --> 02:39:43,190
people to take a big survey the longer
survey is the lower the response rate

9556
02:39:43,190 --> 02:39:43,200
survey is the lower the response rate
 

9557
02:39:43,200 --> 02:39:44,570
survey is the lower the response rate
um and I really wanted to do one big

9558
02:39:44,570 --> 02:39:44,580
um and I really wanted to do one big
 

9559
02:39:44,580 --> 02:39:46,070
um and I really wanted to do one big
comprehensive survey so I could like

9560
02:39:46,070 --> 02:39:46,080
comprehensive survey so I could like
 

9561
02:39:46,080 --> 02:39:47,570
comprehensive survey so I could like
check a whole bunch of correlations with

9562
02:39:47,570 --> 02:39:47,580
check a whole bunch of correlations with
 

9563
02:39:47,580 --> 02:39:49,670
check a whole bunch of correlations with
it within it uh because it's you know

9564
02:39:49,670 --> 02:39:49,680
it within it uh because it's you know
 

9565
02:39:49,680 --> 02:39:52,070
it within it uh because it's you know
more annoying and it's harder to get a

9566
02:39:52,070 --> 02:39:52,080
more annoying and it's harder to get a
 

9567
02:39:52,080 --> 02:39:53,809
more annoying and it's harder to get a
lot of people to retake similar surveys

9568
02:39:53,809 --> 02:39:53,819
lot of people to retake similar surveys
 

9569
02:39:53,819 --> 02:39:55,610
lot of people to retake similar surveys
to each other at a time so I'm like okay

9570
02:39:55,610 --> 02:39:55,620
to each other at a time so I'm like okay

I need to convince a very large number
of people to take a lot of these

9574
02:39:58,490 --> 02:39:58,500
of people to take a lot of these
 

9575
02:39:58,500 --> 02:40:00,050
of people to take a lot of these
questions and even building the

9576
02:40:00,050 --> 02:40:00,060
questions and even building the
 

9577
02:40:00,060 --> 02:40:01,370
questions and even building the
questions that was really hard because

9578
02:40:01,370 --> 02:40:01,380
questions that was really hard because
 

9579

I got this insane character and then Mr

9794
02:43:30,410 --> 02:43:30,420
I got this insane character and then Mr
 

9795
02:43:30,420 --> 02:43:32,990
I got this insane character and then Mr
the sample size exploded from 4 40 000

9796
02:43:32,990 --> 02:43:33,000
the sample size exploded from 4 40 000
 

9797
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:34,670
the sample size exploded from 4 40 000
to 500 000.

9798
02:43:34,670 --> 02:43:34,680
to 500 000.
 

9799
02:43:34,680 --> 02:43:37,130
to 500 000.
wow so like all it took is that kind of

9800
02:43:37,130 --> 02:43:37,140
wow so like all it took is that kind of
 

9801
02:43:37,140 --> 02:43:39,590
wow so like all it took is that kind of
incentive what did you like uh at first

9802
02:43:39,590 --> 02:43:39,600
incentive what did you like uh at first
 

9803
02:43:39,600 --> 02:43:43,250
incentive what did you like uh at first
have to pay people for the server

9804
02:43:43,250 --> 02:43:43,260

 

9805
02:43:43,260 --> 02:43:46,030

foreign

9806
02:43:46,030 --> 02:43:46,040

 

9807
02:43:46,040 --> 02:43:48,590

people that took it I'm mostly younger

9808
02:43:48,590 --> 02:43:48,600
people that took it I'm mostly younger
 

9809
02:43:48,600 --> 02:43:50,990
people that took it I'm mostly younger
so usually early 20s

9810
02:43:50,990 --> 02:43:51,000
so usually early 20s
 

9811
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:53,530
so usually early 20s
um predominantly female like 70 female

9812
02:43:53,530 --> 02:43:53,540
um predominantly female like 70 female
 

9813
02:43:53,540 --> 02:43:56,090
um predominantly female like 70 female
pretty like wraps out on Tick Tock

9814
02:43:56,090 --> 02:43:56,100
pretty like wraps out on Tick Tock
 

9815
02:43:56,100 --> 02:43:58,010
pretty like wraps out on Tick Tock
demographics pretty well yeah oh okay I

9816
02:43:58,010 --> 02:43:58,020
demographics pretty well yeah oh okay I
 

9817
02:43:58,020 --> 02:44:00,410
demographics pretty well yeah oh okay I
got it but that's interesting was young

9818
02:44:00,410 --> 02:44:00,420
got it but that's interesting was young
 

9819
02:44:00,420 --> 02:44:02,690
got it but that's interesting was young
people are probably better for this kind

9820
02:44:02,690 --> 02:44:02,700
people are probably better for this kind
 

9821
02:44:02,700 --> 02:44:05,389
people are probably better for this kind
of survey because there's probably a

9822
02:44:05,389 --> 02:44:05,399
of survey because there's probably a
 

9823
02:44:05,399 --> 02:44:06,770
of survey because there's probably a
culture that's a little bit more honest

9824
02:44:06,770 --> 02:44:06,780
culture that's a little bit more honest
 

9825
02:44:06,780 --> 02:44:08,929
culture that's a little bit more honest
about their sexuality uh yeah most

9826
02:44:08,929 --> 02:44:08,939
about their sexuality uh yeah most
 

9827
02:44:08,939 --> 02:44:10,670
about their sexuality uh yeah most
likely I think people are incentivized

9828
02:44:10,670 --> 02:44:10,680
likely I think people are incentivized
 

9829
02:44:10,680 --> 02:44:12,110
likely I think people are incentivized
to be honest when they're getting a true

9830
02:44:12,110 --> 02:44:12,120
to be honest when they're getting a true
 

9831
02:44:12,120 --> 02:44:13,969
to be honest when they're getting a true
identity response out of it

9832
02:44:13,969 --> 02:44:13,979
identity response out of it
 

9833
02:44:13,979 --> 02:44:16,370
identity response out of it
like sure if you're doing it for money

9834
02:44:16,370 --> 02:44:16,380
like sure if you're doing it for money
 

9835
02:44:16,380 --> 02:44:18,110
like sure if you're doing it for money
you don't care but like if you are

9836
02:44:18,110 --> 02:44:18,120
you don't care but like if you are
 

9837
02:44:18,120 --> 02:44:20,210
you don't care but like if you are
invested in the result you want to know

9838
02:44:20,210 --> 02:44:20,220
invested in the result you want to know
 

9839
02:44:20,220 --> 02:44:22,370
invested in the result you want to know
what the the truth of the answers are

9840
02:44:22,370 --> 02:44:22,380
what the the truth of the answers are
 

9841
02:44:22,380 --> 02:44:23,750
what the the truth of the answers are
then you actually

9842
02:44:23,750 --> 02:44:23,760
then you actually
 

9843
02:44:23,760 --> 02:44:25,910
then you actually
it's possible that you also don't want

9844
02:44:25,910 --> 02:44:25,920
it's possible that you also don't want
 

9845
02:44:25,920 --> 02:44:27,950
it's possible that you also don't want
to know that yeah this is true but on

9846
02:44:27,950 --> 02:44:27,960
to know that yeah this is true but on
 

9847
02:44:27,960 --> 02:44:29,450
to know that yeah this is true but on
average hopefully that doesn't I mean

9848
02:44:29,450 --> 02:44:29,460
average hopefully that doesn't I mean
 

9849
02:44:29,460 --> 02:44:30,590
average hopefully that doesn't I mean
there's these are really difficult like

9850
02:44:30,590 --> 02:44:30,600
there's these are really difficult like
 

9851
02:44:30,600 --> 02:44:32,210
there's these are really difficult like
what what is this some interesting

9852
02:44:32,210 --> 02:44:32,220
what what is this some interesting
 

9853
02:44:32,220 --> 02:44:34,670
what what is this some interesting
little quirks that

9854
02:44:34,670 --> 02:44:34,680
little quirks that
 

9855
02:44:34,680 --> 02:44:36,590
little quirks that
um people should know about about your

9856
02:44:36,590 --> 02:44:36,600
um people should know about about your
 

9857
02:44:36,600 --> 02:44:38,690
um people should know about about your
methodology that you had to kind of

9858
02:44:38,690 --> 02:44:38,700
methodology that you had to kind of
 

9859
02:44:38,700 --> 02:44:41,090
methodology that you had to kind of
solve to try to get to a really good

9860
02:44:41,090 --> 02:44:41,100
solve to try to get to a really good
 

9861
02:44:41,100 --> 02:44:42,469
solve to try to get to a really good
survey so one of you said is the

9862
02:44:42,469 --> 02:44:42,479
survey so one of you said is the
 

9863
02:44:42,479 --> 02:44:44,570
survey so one of you said is the
categorization to make it more efficient

9864
02:44:44,570 --> 02:44:44,580
categorization to make it more efficient
 

9865
02:44:44,580 --> 02:44:47,210
categorization to make it more efficient
is there some for the analysis part yeah

9866
02:44:47,210 --> 02:44:47,220
is there some for the analysis part yeah
 

9867
02:44:47,220 --> 02:44:48,830
is there some for the analysis part yeah
so the the graph that you're talking

9868
02:44:48,830 --> 02:44:48,840
so the the graph that you're talking
 

9869
02:44:48,840 --> 02:44:51,889
so the the graph that you're talking
about it's um it's a binary so it's like

9870
02:44:51,889 --> 02:44:51,899
about it's um it's a binary so it's like
 

9871
02:44:51,899 --> 02:44:53,630
about it's um it's a binary so it's like
if you and if somebody expressed even a

9872
02:44:53,630 --> 02:44:53,640
if you and if somebody expressed even a
 

9873
02:44:53,640 --> 02:44:55,130
if you and if somebody expressed even a
little bit of Interest then it goes into

9874
02:44:55,130 --> 02:44:55,140
little bit of Interest then it goes into
 

9875
02:44:55,140 --> 02:44:57,170
little bit of Interest then it goes into
the graph so it's like 80 of people

9876
02:44:57,170 --> 02:44:57,180
the graph so it's like 80 of people
 

9877
02:44:57,180 --> 02:44:58,370
the graph so it's like 80 of people
expressed even a little bit of Interest

9878
02:44:58,370 --> 02:44:58,380
expressed even a little bit of Interest
 

9879
02:44:58,380 --> 02:45:00,110
expressed even a little bit of Interest
so it's not representing degree of

9880
02:45:00,110 --> 02:45:00,120
so it's not representing degree of
 

9881
02:45:00,120 --> 02:45:01,610
so it's not representing degree of
interest it's not differentiating

9882
02:45:01,610 --> 02:45:01,620
interest it's not differentiating
 

9883
02:45:01,620 --> 02:45:02,990
interest it's not differentiating
between them at all so it's possible

9884
02:45:02,990 --> 02:45:03,000
between them at all so it's possible
 

9885
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:04,670
between them at all so it's possible
that like some fetishes have exactly the

9886
02:45:04,670 --> 02:45:04,680
that like some fetishes have exactly the
 

9887
02:45:04,680 --> 02:45:06,410
that like some fetishes have exactly the
same amount of people like are at least

9888
02:45:06,410 --> 02:45:06,420
same amount of people like are at least
 

9889
02:45:06,420 --> 02:45:07,670
same amount of people like are at least
a little bit into them but one of them

9890
02:45:07,670 --> 02:45:07,680
a little bit into them but one of them
 

9891
02:45:07,680 --> 02:45:09,469
a little bit into them but one of them
is very extreme interest and the other

9892
02:45:09,469 --> 02:45:09,479
is very extreme interest and the other
 

9893
02:45:09,479 --> 02:45:10,490
is very extreme interest and the other
is like

9894
02:45:10,490 --> 02:45:10,500
is like
 

9895
02:45:10,500 --> 02:45:13,370
is like
fake and not very intense so that's not

9896
02:45:13,370 --> 02:45:13,380
fake and not very intense so that's not
 

9897
02:45:13,380 --> 02:45:15,770
fake and not very intense so that's not
reflected I also like probably didn't

9898
02:45:15,770 --> 02:45:15,780
reflected I also like probably didn't
 

9899
02:45:15,780 --> 02:45:18,770
reflected I also like probably didn't
represent the visual part right like

9900
02:45:18,770 --> 02:45:18,780
represent the visual part right like
 

9901
02:45:18,780 --> 02:45:21,469
represent the visual part right like
might not be intuitive but he chose a

9902
02:45:21,469 --> 02:45:21,479
might not be intuitive but he chose a
 

9903
02:45:21,479 --> 02:45:23,450
might not be intuitive but he chose a
log scale but it was kind of spreads

9904
02:45:23,450 --> 02:45:23,460
log scale but it was kind of spreads
 

9905
02:45:23,460 --> 02:45:26,030
log scale but it was kind of spreads
things out to makes it more and more

9906
02:45:26,030 --> 02:45:26,040
things out to makes it more and more
 

9907
02:45:26,040 --> 02:45:27,770
things out to makes it more and more
clear because the linear it was just so

9908
02:45:27,770 --> 02:45:27,780
clear because the linear it was just so
 

9909
02:45:27,780 --> 02:45:29,030
clear because the linear it was just so
clustered at the bottom you couldn't

9910
02:45:29,030 --> 02:45:29,040
clustered at the bottom you couldn't
 

9911
02:45:29,040 --> 02:45:30,830
clustered at the bottom you couldn't
really separate it out so there's

9912
02:45:30,830 --> 02:45:30,840
really separate it out so there's
 

9913
02:45:30,840 --> 02:45:32,210
really separate it out so there's
obviously a selection effects it's

9914
02:45:32,210 --> 02:45:32,220
obviously a selection effects it's
 

9915
02:45:32,220 --> 02:45:34,190
obviously a selection effects it's
possible that like the identity results

9916
02:45:34,190 --> 02:45:34,200
possible that like the identity results
 

9917
02:45:34,200 --> 02:45:36,410
possible that like the identity results
at the end impacted people's results a

9918
02:45:36,410 --> 02:45:36,420
at the end impacted people's results a
 

9919
02:45:36,420 --> 02:45:38,150
at the end impacted people's results a
little bit but the thing is like I'm

9920
02:45:38,150 --> 02:45:38,160
little bit but the thing is like I'm
 

9921
02:45:38,160 --> 02:45:40,849
little bit but the thing is like I'm
comparing it to what exists like what is

9922
02:45:40,849 --> 02:45:40,859
comparing it to what exists like what is
 

9923
02:45:40,859 --> 02:45:42,889
comparing it to what exists like what is
the alternative and right now the

9924
02:45:42,889 --> 02:45:42,899
the alternative and right now the
 

9925
02:45:42,899 --> 02:45:45,050
the alternative and right now the
research on this stuff is terrible so

9926
02:45:45,050 --> 02:45:45,060
research on this stuff is terrible so
 

9927
02:45:45,060 --> 02:45:46,370
research on this stuff is terrible so
it's like I'm not saying my research is

9928
02:45:46,370 --> 02:45:46,380
it's like I'm not saying my research is
 

9929
02:45:46,380 --> 02:45:48,110
it's like I'm not saying my research is
perfect um but it's like at least it's

9930
02:45:48,110 --> 02:45:48,120
perfect um but it's like at least it's
 

9931
02:45:48,120 --> 02:45:49,190
perfect um but it's like at least it's
something like it's something that's

9932
02:45:49,190 --> 02:45:49,200
something like it's something that's
 

9933
02:45:49,200 --> 02:45:51,469
something like it's something that's
pointing us maybe in a direction that we

9934
02:45:51,469 --> 02:45:51,479
pointing us maybe in a direction that we
 

9935
02:45:51,479 --> 02:45:53,030
pointing us maybe in a direction that we
might be able to do more research on and

9936
02:45:53,030 --> 02:45:53,040
might be able to do more research on and
 

9937
02:45:53,040 --> 02:45:54,830
might be able to do more research on and
you're making the data available yeah

9938
02:45:54,830 --> 02:45:54,840
you're making the data available yeah
 

9939
02:45:54,840 --> 02:45:58,130
you're making the data available yeah
yeah I'm doing it slowly because uh it

9940
02:45:58,130 --> 02:45:58,140
yeah I'm doing it slowly because uh it
 

9941
02:45:58,140 --> 02:46:00,110
yeah I'm doing it slowly because uh it
they're so I ask about so many questions

9942
02:46:00,110 --> 02:46:00,120
they're so I ask about so many questions
 

9943
02:46:00,120 --> 02:46:01,910
they're so I ask about so many questions
it's like not very anonymized so I'm

9944
02:46:01,910 --> 02:46:01,920
it's like not very anonymized so I'm
 

9945
02:46:01,920 --> 02:46:03,410
it's like not very anonymized so I'm
really seeing small sections of the data

9946
02:46:03,410 --> 02:46:03,420
really seeing small sections of the data
 

9947
02:46:03,420 --> 02:46:05,530
really seeing small sections of the data
at a time yeah

9948
02:46:05,530 --> 02:46:05,540
at a time yeah
 

9949
02:46:05,540 --> 02:46:08,330

9953
02:46:10,380 --> 02:46:12,770
journals and stuff no I haven't you have
any any interest in that or is your your

9954
02:46:12,770 --> 02:46:12,780
any any interest in that or is your your
 

9955
02:46:12,780 --> 02:46:14,570
any any interest in that or is your your
approach I'm like I'm conflicted about

9956
02:46:14,570 --> 02:46:14,580
approach I'm like I'm conflicted about
 

9957
02:46:14,580 --> 02:46:16,370
approach I'm like I'm conflicted about
it like it sounds cool because then I

9958
02:46:16,370 --> 02:46:16,380
it like it sounds cool because then I
 

9959
02:46:16,380 --> 02:46:18,050
it like it sounds cool because then I
could really call her and publish on the

9960
02:46:18,050 --> 02:46:18,060
could really call her and publish on the
 

9961
02:46:18,060 --> 02:46:19,610
could really call her and publish on the
journal and then people who are yelling

9962
02:46:19,610 --> 02:46:19,620
journal and then people who are yelling
 

9963
02:46:19,620 --> 02:46:20,990
journal and then people who are yelling
about me who don't know anything about

9964
02:46:20,990 --> 02:46:21,000
about me who don't know anything about
 

9965
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:22,370
about me who don't know anything about
statistics on Twitter like then I can go

9966
02:46:22,370 --> 02:46:22,380
statistics on Twitter like then I can go
 

9967
02:46:22,380 --> 02:46:23,870
statistics on Twitter like then I can go
like shove it in their face but then

9968
02:46:23,870 --> 02:46:23,880
like shove it in their face but then
 

9969
02:46:23,880 --> 02:46:26,030
like shove it in their face but then
you're also giving in to the silly

criticism like I don't like I want I
feel so passionate about extra science

9974
02:46:31,730 --> 02:46:31,740
feel so passionate about extra science
 

9975
02:46:31,740 --> 02:46:33,349
feel so passionate about extra science
like science that you can just just do

9976
02:46:33,349 --> 02:46:33,359
like science that you can just just do
 

9977
02:46:33,359 --> 02:46:35,330
like science that you can just just do
like I want to make science accessible

9978
02:46:35,330 --> 02:46:35,340
like I want to make science accessible
 

9979
02:46:35,340 --> 02:46:37,550
like I want to make science accessible
like anybody can just go look and learn

9980
02:46:37,550 --> 02:46:37,560
like anybody can just go look and learn
 

9981
02:46:37,560 --> 02:46:39,830
like anybody can just go look and learn
about the basics of like doing a survey

9982
02:46:39,830 --> 02:46:39,840
about the basics of like doing a survey
 

9983
02:46:39,840 --> 02:46:41,510
about the basics of like doing a survey
or figuring out how to interpret

9984
02:46:41,510 --> 02:46:41,520
or figuring out how to interpret
 

9985
02:46:41,520 --> 02:46:42,889
or figuring out how to interpret
information

9986
02:46:42,889 --> 02:46:42,899
information
 

9987
02:46:42,899 --> 02:46:45,530
information
um and doing a published Journal feels

9988
02:46:45,530 --> 02:46:45,540
um and doing a published Journal feels
 

9989
02:46:45,540 --> 02:46:47,990
um and doing a published Journal feels
like I'm I'm betraying my cause a little

9990
02:46:47,990 --> 02:46:48,000
like I'm I'm betraying my cause a little
 

9991
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:48,710
like I'm I'm betraying my cause a little
bit

9992

bit
 

9993
02:46:48,720 --> 02:46:51,170
bit
that's often behind the paywall yeah

9994
02:46:51,170 --> 02:46:51,180
that's often behind the paywall yeah
 

9995
02:46:51,180 --> 02:46:53,809
that's often behind the paywall yeah
it's uh it goes against the

9996
02:46:53,809 --> 02:46:53,819
it's uh it goes against the
 

9997
02:46:53,819 --> 02:46:55,849
it's uh it goes against the
I mean I think you not publishing a

9998
02:46:55,849 --> 02:46:55,859
I mean I think you not publishing a
 

9999
02:46:55,859 --> 02:47:00,950
I mean I think you not publishing a
journal is doing a big public service

10000
02:47:00,950 --> 02:47:00,960

 

10001
02:47:00,960 --> 02:47:02,809

thank you oh it's just coming from like

10002
02:47:02,809 --> 02:47:02,819
thank you oh it's just coming from like
 

10003
02:47:02,819 --> 02:47:06,710
thank you oh it's just coming from like
on this topic the elite the elitism I

10004
02:47:06,710 --> 02:47:06,720
on this topic the elite the elitism I
 

10005
02:47:06,720 --> 02:47:09,170
on this topic the elite the elitism I
see on the psychology side with the

10006
02:47:09,170 --> 02:47:09,180
see on the psychology side with the
 

10007
02:47:09,180 --> 02:47:11,330
see on the psychology side with the
journals and the Academia the positions

10008
02:47:11,330 --> 02:47:11,340
journals and the Academia the positions
 

10009
02:47:11,340 --> 02:47:13,429
journals and the Academia the positions
and the institutions you come from all

10010
02:47:13,429 --> 02:47:13,439
and the institutions you come from all
 

10011
02:47:13,439 --> 02:47:16,790
and the institutions you come from all
that that goes against

10012
02:47:16,790 --> 02:47:16,800
that that goes against
 

10013
02:47:16,800 --> 02:47:18,889
that that goes against
um I think that's more useful for math

10014
02:47:18,889 --> 02:47:18,899
um I think that's more useful for math
 

10015
02:47:18,899 --> 02:47:21,050
um I think that's more useful for math
and computer science and so on where

10016
02:47:21,050 --> 02:47:21,060
and computer science and so on where
 

10017
02:47:21,060 --> 02:47:22,250
and computer science and so on where
there's like

10018
02:47:22,250 --> 02:47:22,260
there's like
 

10019
02:47:22,260 --> 02:47:27,469
there's like
clear like but even then even then code

10020
02:47:27,469 --> 02:47:27,479
clear like but even then even then code
 

10021
02:47:27,479 --> 02:47:30,469
clear like but even then even then code
is code data is data yeah like uh

10022
02:47:30,469 --> 02:47:30,479
is code data is data yeah like uh
 

10023
02:47:30,479 --> 02:47:33,110
is code data is data yeah like uh
Prestige shouldn't matter at all

10024
02:47:33,110 --> 02:47:33,120
Prestige shouldn't matter at all
 

10025
02:47:33,120 --> 02:47:35,809
Prestige shouldn't matter at all
um maybe maybe for like

10026

um maybe maybe for like
 

10027
02:47:35,819 --> 02:47:37,910
um maybe maybe for like
like biological experiments like

10028
02:47:37,910 --> 02:47:37,920
like biological experiments like
 

10029
02:47:37,920 --> 02:47:40,070
like biological experiments like
fireology or something like that

10030
02:47:40,070 --> 02:47:40,080
fireology or something like that
 

10031
02:47:40,080 --> 02:47:42,590
fireology or something like that
it's good to be from a major lab that

10032
02:47:42,590 --> 02:47:42,600
it's good to be from a major lab that
 

10033
02:47:42,600 --> 02:47:45,590
it's good to be from a major lab that
has a reputation for like going through

10034
02:47:45,590 --> 02:47:45,600
has a reputation for like going through
 

10035
02:47:45,600 --> 02:47:47,090
has a reputation for like going through
all the procedures like you know you can

10036
02:47:47,090 --> 02:47:47,100
all the procedures like you know you can
 

10037
02:47:47,100 --> 02:47:49,849
all the procedures like you know you can
trust but here like you're dealing with

10038
02:47:49,849 --> 02:47:49,859
trust but here like you're dealing with
 

10039
02:47:49,859 --> 02:47:52,490

a giant mess of humanity like it it's
 

10041
02:47:52,500 --> 02:47:54,650
a giant mess of humanity like it it's
beautiful to be transparent to be raw to

10042
02:47:54,650 --> 02:47:54,660
beautiful to be transparent to be raw to
 

10043
02:47:54,660 --> 02:47:56,150
beautiful to be transparent to be raw to
be exploring it together with everybody

10044
02:47:56,150 --> 02:47:56,160

10045
02:47:56,160 --> 02:47:57,889
be exploring it together with everybody
else it's really beautiful I have people

10046
02:47:57,889 --> 02:47:57,899
else it's really beautiful I have people
 

10047

like have a lot of incentive to doubt
 

10049
02:47:59,880 --> 02:48:01,370
like have a lot of incentive to doubt
the results like a lot of the research

10050
02:48:01,370 --> 02:48:01,380
the results like a lot of the research
 

10051
02:48:01,380 --> 02:48:03,050
the results like a lot of the research
I'm doing is to like assists and trans

10052
02:48:03,050 --> 02:48:03,060
I'm doing is to like assists and trans
 

10053
02:48:03,060 --> 02:48:05,690
I'm doing is to like assists and trans
people like like we don't have any data

10054
02:48:05,690 --> 02:48:05,700
people like like we don't have any data
 

10055
02:48:05,700 --> 02:48:07,849
people like like we don't have any data
about transsexuality like not very good

10056
02:48:07,849 --> 02:48:07,859
about transsexuality like not very good
 

10057
02:48:07,859 --> 02:48:09,050
about transsexuality like not very good
at least

10058
02:48:09,050 --> 02:48:09,060
at least
 

10059
02:48:09,060 --> 02:48:10,429
at least
um and I'm really curious I don't really

10061
02:48:10,439 --> 02:48:11,990
um and I'm really curious I don't really
have an agenda about it I think like

10062
02:48:11,990 --> 02:48:12,000
have an agenda about it I think like
 

10063
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:14,210
have an agenda about it I think like
being trans is cool if you want to be

10064
02:48:14,210 --> 02:48:14,220
being trans is cool if you want to be
 

10065
02:48:14,220 --> 02:48:15,650
being trans is cool if you want to be
trans do it and like I have some

trans do it and like I have some
skepticism about like gender Theory but

02:48:18,110 --> 02:48:18,120
skepticism about like gender Theory but
 

10069
02:48:18,120 --> 02:48:19,849
skepticism about like gender Theory but
like it doesn't come down to impact like

10070
02:48:19,849 --> 02:48:19,859
like it doesn't come down to impact like
 

10071
02:48:19,859 --> 02:48:20,929
like it doesn't come down to impact like
the way I think trans people should be

10072
02:48:20,929 --> 02:48:20,939
the way I think trans people should be
 

10073
02:48:20,939 --> 02:48:22,550
the way I think trans people should be
treated which I think is like treat them

10074
02:48:22,550 --> 02:48:22,560
treated which I think is like treat them
 

10075
02:48:22,560 --> 02:48:24,590
treated which I think is like treat them
you know be [\h__\h] nice and human about

10076
02:48:24,590 --> 02:48:24,600
you know be [\h__\h] nice and human about
 

10077
02:48:24,600 --> 02:48:26,389
you know be [\h__\h] nice and human about
it I don't know but when I'm talking

10078
02:48:26,389 --> 02:48:26,399
it I don't know but when I'm talking
 

10079
02:48:26,399 --> 02:48:28,370
it I don't know but when I'm talking
about the the thing like my conclusions

10080
02:48:28,370 --> 02:48:28,380
about the the thing like my conclusions
 

10081
02:48:28,380 --> 02:48:30,230
about the the thing like my conclusions
are that like uh transsexuality is

10082
02:48:30,230 --> 02:48:30,240
are that like uh transsexuality is
 

10083
02:48:30,240 --> 02:48:31,370
are that like uh transsexuality is
really unique

10084
02:48:31,370 --> 02:48:31,380
really unique
 

10085
02:48:31,380 --> 02:48:34,429
really unique
um it's not like like sister or CIS

10086
02:48:34,429 --> 02:48:34,439
um it's not like like sister or CIS
 

10087
02:48:34,439 --> 02:48:36,410
um it's not like like sister or CIS
woman or man sexuality at all and me

10088
02:48:36,410 --> 02:48:36,420
woman or man sexuality at all and me
 

10089
02:48:36,420 --> 02:48:37,849
woman or man sexuality at all and me
this is super cool but like a lot of

10090
02:48:37,849 --> 02:48:37,859
this is super cool but like a lot of
 

10091
02:48:37,859 --> 02:48:39,469
this is super cool but like a lot of
people this is very politicized right

10092
02:48:39,469 --> 02:48:39,479
people this is very politicized right
 

10093
02:48:39,479 --> 02:48:42,830
people this is very politicized right
now like the data into like transsexual

10094
02:48:42,830 --> 02:48:42,840
now like the data into like transsexual
 

10095
02:48:42,840 --> 02:48:44,690
now like the data into like transsexual
preferences like it's so loaded which is

10096
02:48:44,690 --> 02:48:44,700
preferences like it's so loaded which is
 

10097
02:48:44,700 --> 02:48:46,730
preferences like it's so loaded which is
really sad because I am very accepting

10098
02:48:46,730 --> 02:48:46,740
really sad because I am very accepting
 

10099
02:48:46,740 --> 02:48:48,889
really sad because I am very accepting
of weird sexuality like if you're into a

10100
02:48:48,889 --> 02:48:48,899
of weird sexuality like if you're into a
 

10101
02:48:48,899 --> 02:48:50,389
of weird sexuality like if you're into a
weird thing I'm like good for you this

10102
02:48:50,389 --> 02:48:50,399
weird thing I'm like good for you this
 

10103
02:48:50,399 --> 02:48:52,010
weird thing I'm like good for you this
is super cool like let's figure out how

10104
02:48:52,010 --> 02:48:52,020
is super cool like let's figure out how
 

10105
02:48:52,020 --> 02:48:53,929
is super cool like let's figure out how
to make it so that you can explore the

10106
02:48:53,929 --> 02:48:53,939
to make it so that you can explore the
 

10107
02:48:53,939 --> 02:48:56,210
to make it so that you can explore the
thing you're into without any stigma but

10108
02:48:56,210 --> 02:48:56,220
thing you're into without any stigma but
 

10109
02:48:56,220 --> 02:48:57,710
thing you're into without any stigma but
because there's so much stigma that like

10110
02:48:57,710 --> 02:48:57,720
because there's so much stigma that like
 

10111
02:48:57,720 --> 02:48:59,389
because there's so much stigma that like
if you find that one demographic isn't a

10112
02:48:59,389 --> 02:48:59,399
if you find that one demographic isn't a
 

10113
02:48:59,399 --> 02:49:00,889
if you find that one demographic isn't a
weirder sex stuff than the other like

10114
02:49:00,889 --> 02:49:00,899
weirder sex stuff than the other like
 

10115
02:49:00,899 --> 02:49:02,389
weirder sex stuff than the other like
it's hard to present that in a way that

10116
02:49:02,389 --> 02:49:02,399
it's hard to present that in a way that
 

10117
02:49:02,399 --> 02:49:04,429
it's hard to present that in a way that
people don't weaponize so it's been it's

10118
02:49:04,429 --> 02:49:04,439
people don't weaponize so it's been it's
 

10119
02:49:04,439 --> 02:49:05,929
people don't weaponize so it's been it's
been really politically touchy subject

10120
02:49:05,929 --> 02:49:05,939
been really politically touchy subject
 

10121
02:49:05,939 --> 02:49:07,969
been really politically touchy subject
here yeah but you do it in a way that's

10122
02:49:07,969 --> 02:49:07,979
here yeah but you do it in a way that's
 

10123
02:49:07,979 --> 02:49:10,250
here yeah but you do it in a way that's
not this it's not feel like it has an

10124
02:49:10,250 --> 02:49:10,260
not this it's not feel like it has an
 

10125
02:49:10,260 --> 02:49:13,010
not this it's not feel like it has an
agenda right you're just exploring yeah

10126
02:49:13,010 --> 02:49:13,020
agenda right you're just exploring yeah
 

10127
02:49:13,020 --> 02:49:15,590
agenda right you're just exploring yeah
I feel pretty open to what I'm gonna

10128
02:49:15,590 --> 02:49:15,600
I feel pretty open to what I'm gonna
 

10129
02:49:15,600 --> 02:49:17,870
I feel pretty open to what I'm gonna
find like I often have no idea what the

10130
02:49:17,870 --> 02:49:17,880
find like I often have no idea what the
 

10131
02:49:17,880 --> 02:49:19,010
find like I often have no idea what the
date is going to tell me and I'm like I

10132
02:49:19,010 --> 02:49:19,020
date is going to tell me and I'm like I
 

10133
02:49:19,020 --> 02:49:20,929
date is going to tell me and I'm like I
pre-commit like okay I could say a b or

10134
02:49:20,929 --> 02:49:20,939
pre-commit like okay I could say a b or
 

10135
02:49:20,939 --> 02:49:22,610
pre-commit like okay I could say a b or
c and I'm like down to publish any of

10136
02:49:22,610 --> 02:49:22,620
c and I'm like down to publish any of
 

10137
02:49:22,620 --> 02:49:24,530
c and I'm like down to publish any of
those findings

10138
02:49:24,530 --> 02:49:24,540
those findings
 

10139
02:49:24,540 --> 02:49:28,010
those findings
uh so you've put together an Ask whole

10140
02:49:28,010 --> 02:49:28,020
uh so you've put together an Ask whole
 

10141
02:49:28,020 --> 02:49:30,349
uh so you've put together an Ask whole
cart deck yeah a lot of awesome

10142
02:49:30,349 --> 02:49:30,359
cart deck yeah a lot of awesome
 

10143
02:49:30,359 --> 02:49:33,050
cart deck yeah a lot of awesome
questions to ask at a party

10144
02:49:33,050 --> 02:49:33,060
questions to ask at a party
 

10145
02:49:33,060 --> 02:49:35,270
questions to ask at a party
or anywhere honestly

10146
02:49:35,270 --> 02:49:35,280
or anywhere honestly
 

10147

or anywhere honestly
including on the podcast let me ask you

10148
02:49:37,190 --> 02:49:37,200
including on the podcast let me ask you
 

10149
02:49:37,200 --> 02:49:39,889
including on the podcast let me ask you
one from from from that deck is sex

10150
02:49:39,889 --> 02:49:39,899
one from from from that deck is sex
 

10151
02:49:39,899 --> 02:49:42,290
one from from from that deck is sex
really about power so what's the role of

10152
02:49:42,290 --> 02:49:42,300
really about power so what's the role of
 

10153
02:49:42,300 --> 02:49:44,270

power dynamics in sex
and then everything you understand like

10156
02:49:45,650 --> 02:49:45,660
and then everything you understand like
 

10157
02:49:45,660 --> 02:49:47,690
and then everything you understand like
in from the survey in terms of what

10158
02:49:47,690 --> 02:49:47,700
in from the survey in terms of what
 

10159
02:49:47,700 --> 02:49:50,270
in from the survey in terms of what
people are turned on by you've talked

10160
02:49:50,270 --> 02:49:50,280
people are turned on by you've talked
 

10161
02:49:50,280 --> 02:49:52,070
people are turned on by you've talked
about like the preferences that women

10162
02:49:52,070 --> 02:49:52,080
about like the preferences that women
 

10163
02:49:52,080 --> 02:49:55,010
about like the preferences that women
versus men have for like submissiveness

10164
02:49:55,010 --> 02:49:55,020
versus men have for like submissiveness
 

10165
02:49:55,020 --> 02:49:56,809
versus men have for like submissiveness
and dominance

10166
02:49:56,809 --> 02:49:56,819
and dominance
 

10167
02:49:56,819 --> 02:49:59,030
and dominance
and uh we've already talked about it a

10168
02:49:59,030 --> 02:49:59,040
and uh we've already talked about it a
 

10169
02:49:59,040 --> 02:50:01,190
and uh we've already talked about it a
little bit but like it's expressed more

10170
02:50:01,190 --> 02:50:01,200
little bit but like it's expressed more
 

10171
02:50:01,200 --> 02:50:03,050
little bit but like it's expressed more
strongly see I already forget the

10172
02:50:03,050 --> 02:50:03,060
strongly see I already forget the
 

10173
02:50:03,060 --> 02:50:04,730
strongly see I already forget the
results but I feel like women have more

10174
02:50:04,730 --> 02:50:04,740
results but I feel like women have more
 

10175
02:50:04,740 --> 02:50:06,469
results but I feel like women have more
preference to be submissive yeah this is

10176
02:50:06,469 --> 02:50:06,479
preference to be submissive yeah this is
 

10177
02:50:06,479 --> 02:50:07,670
preference to be submissive yeah this is
one of the things that got me into

10178
02:50:07,670 --> 02:50:07,680
one of the things that got me into
 

10179
02:50:07,680 --> 02:50:09,349
one of the things that got me into
researching fetches to begin with

10180
02:50:09,349 --> 02:50:09,359
researching fetches to begin with
 

10181
02:50:09,359 --> 02:50:11,750
researching fetches to begin with
because I think I came across some data

10182
02:50:11,750 --> 02:50:11,760
because I think I came across some data
 

10183
02:50:11,760 --> 02:50:14,030
because I think I came across some data
I did like a brief survey where about

10184
02:50:14,030 --> 02:50:14,040
I did like a brief survey where about
 

10185
02:50:14,040 --> 02:50:16,309
I did like a brief survey where about
roughly around 60 of women report being

10186
02:50:16,309 --> 02:50:16,319
roughly around 60 of women report being
 

10187
02:50:16,319 --> 02:50:18,349
roughly around 60 of women report being
submissive and 40 of men report being

10188
02:50:18,349 --> 02:50:18,359
submissive and 40 of men report being
 

10189
02:50:18,359 --> 02:50:20,150
submissive and 40 of men report being
dominant and this is really fascinating

10190
02:50:20,150 --> 02:50:20,160
dominant and this is really fascinating
 

10191
02:50:20,160 --> 02:50:22,730
dominant and this is really fascinating
to me like why is there this Gap like

10192
02:50:22,730 --> 02:50:22,740
to me like why is there this Gap like
 

10193
02:50:22,740 --> 02:50:25,130
to me like why is there this Gap like
why why do we not because I guess I have

10194
02:50:25,130 --> 02:50:25,140
why why do we not because I guess I have
 

10195
02:50:25,140 --> 02:50:26,389
why why do we not because I guess I have
some priors that maybe this is an

10196
02:50:26,389 --> 02:50:26,399
some priors that maybe this is an
 

10197
02:50:26,399 --> 02:50:28,370
some priors that maybe this is an
evolutionary thing like the submission

10198
02:50:28,370 --> 02:50:28,380
evolutionary thing like the submission
 

10199
02:50:28,380 --> 02:50:30,050
evolutionary thing like the submission
dominant like strong men and you know

10200
02:50:30,050 --> 02:50:30,060
dominant like strong men and you know
 

10201
02:50:30,060 --> 02:50:32,090
dominant like strong men and you know
like women would be like us hot hot man

10202
02:50:32,090 --> 02:50:32,100
like women would be like us hot hot man
 

10203
02:50:32,100 --> 02:50:33,710
like women would be like us hot hot man
you know the men are like ravaging and

10204
02:50:33,710 --> 02:50:33,720
you know the men are like ravaging and
 

10205
02:50:33,720 --> 02:50:35,690
you know the men are like ravaging and
stuff I'm like shouldn't this be a in

10206
02:50:35,690 --> 02:50:35,700
stuff I'm like shouldn't this be a in
 

10207
02:50:35,700 --> 02:50:38,690
stuff I'm like shouldn't this be a in
our jeans but but there's a gap

10208
02:50:38,690 --> 02:50:38,700
our jeans but but there's a gap
 

10209
02:50:38,700 --> 02:50:40,849
our jeans but but there's a gap
what's the Gap the Gap is the dominant

10210
02:50:40,849 --> 02:50:40,859
what's the Gap the Gap is the dominant
 

10211
02:50:40,859 --> 02:50:42,349
what's the Gap the Gap is the dominant
submissive Gap more women are submissive

10212
02:50:42,349 --> 02:50:42,359
submissive Gap more women are submissive
 

10213
02:50:42,359 --> 02:50:43,849
submissive Gap more women are submissive
and there are dominant men

10214
02:50:43,849 --> 02:50:43,859
and there are dominant men
 

10215
02:50:43,859 --> 02:50:47,150
and there are dominant men
oh yeah really yeah it's a pretty

10216
02:50:47,150 --> 02:50:47,160
oh yeah really yeah it's a pretty
 

10217
02:50:47,160 --> 02:50:49,070
oh yeah really yeah it's a pretty
significant Gap and this is held up like

10218
02:50:49,070 --> 02:50:49,080
significant Gap and this is held up like
 

10219
02:50:49,080 --> 02:50:50,330
significant Gap and this is held up like
it depends on what you're testing I've

10220
02:50:50,330 --> 02:50:50,340
it depends on what you're testing I've
 

10221
02:50:50,340 --> 02:50:51,889
it depends on what you're testing I've
tested a bunch of things this is part of

10222
02:50:51,889 --> 02:50:51,899
tested a bunch of things this is part of
 

10223
02:50:51,899 --> 02:50:54,230
tested a bunch of things this is part of
why I did this big survey nice but it

10224
02:50:54,230 --> 02:50:54,240
why I did this big survey nice but it
 

10225
02:50:54,240 --> 02:50:56,570
why I did this big survey nice but it
depends against again on like what kind

10226
02:50:56,570 --> 02:50:56,580
depends against again on like what kind
 

10227
02:50:56,580 --> 02:50:57,710
depends against again on like what kind
of dominance you're measuring but

10228
02:50:57,710 --> 02:50:57,720
of dominance you're measuring but
 

10229
02:50:57,720 --> 02:51:00,830
of dominance you're measuring but
overall it's a roughly 40 to 60 So when

10230
02:51:00,830 --> 02:51:00,840
overall it's a roughly 40 to 60 So when
 

10231
02:51:00,840 --> 02:51:03,050
overall it's a roughly 40 to 60 So when
you say there's not many dominant men

10232
02:51:03,050 --> 02:51:03,060
you say there's not many dominant men
 

10233
02:51:03,060 --> 02:51:05,270
you say there's not many dominant men
then the the meaning like they express

10234
02:51:05,270 --> 02:51:05,280
then the the meaning like they express
 

10235
02:51:05,280 --> 02:51:07,309
then the the meaning like they express
like a desire to be dominant in the

10236
02:51:07,309 --> 02:51:07,319
like a desire to be dominant in the
 

10237
02:51:07,319 --> 02:51:09,290
like a desire to be dominant in the
relationship yeah or like in sexually

10238
02:51:09,290 --> 02:51:09,300
relationship yeah or like in sexually
 

10239
02:51:09,300 --> 02:51:11,929
relationship yeah or like in sexually
sexually sexually in bed so like if I

10240
02:51:11,929 --> 02:51:11,939
sexually sexually in bed so like if I
 

10241
02:51:11,939 --> 02:51:13,309
sexually sexually in bed so like if I
ask questions like how much do you like

10242
02:51:13,309 --> 02:51:13,319
ask questions like how much do you like
 

10243
02:51:13,319 --> 02:51:15,349
ask questions like how much do you like
being dominant in bed like men are less

10244
02:51:15,349 --> 02:51:15,359
being dominant in bed like men are less
 

10245
02:51:15,359 --> 02:51:17,210
being dominant in bed like men are less
likely to answer strong yes to that

10246
02:51:17,210 --> 02:51:17,220
likely to answer strong yes to that
 

10247
02:51:17,220 --> 02:51:20,150
likely to answer strong yes to that
question but if I ask are you likely to

10248
02:51:20,150 --> 02:51:20,160
question but if I ask are you likely to
 

10249
02:51:20,160 --> 02:51:21,710
question but if I ask are you likely to
be submissive like women are very much

10250

really and that's expressive like that's
 

10255
02:51:25,439 --> 02:51:28,849
really and that's expressive like that's
that that that represents truth

10256
02:51:28,849 --> 02:51:28,859
that that that represents truth
 

10257
02:51:28,859 --> 02:51:30,290
that that that represents truth
um my guess what's wrong with men so

10258
02:51:30,290 --> 02:51:30,300
um my guess what's wrong with men so
 

10259
02:51:30,300 --> 02:51:32,150
um my guess what's wrong with men so
this is I think there's some reflection

10260
02:51:32,150 --> 02:51:32,160
this is I think there's some reflection
 

10261
02:51:32,160 --> 02:51:33,290
this is I think there's some reflection
in like fet life so felt like this

10262
02:51:33,290 --> 02:51:33,300
in like fet life so felt like this
 

10263
02:51:33,300 --> 02:51:34,910
in like fet life so felt like this
website where people like sign up and

10264
02:51:34,910 --> 02:51:34,920
website where people like sign up and
 

10265
02:51:34,920 --> 02:51:36,950
website where people like sign up and
connect based on their fetishes and this

10266

connect based on their fetishes and this
 

10267
02:51:36,960 --> 02:51:38,870
connect based on their fetishes and this
is like you can kind of see it picked up

10268
02:51:38,870 --> 02:51:38,880
is like you can kind of see it picked up
 

10269
02:51:38,880 --> 02:51:40,849
is like you can kind of see it picked up
in the Forum post about like how like

10270
02:51:40,849 --> 02:51:40,859
in the Forum post about like how like
 

10271
02:51:40,859 --> 02:51:42,290
in the Forum post about like how like
dominant men are you know are getting

02:51:42,300 --> 02:51:44,030
dominant men are you know are getting
laid so much and you know submissives

10274

laid so much and you know submissives
 

10275
02:51:44,040 --> 02:51:45,830
laid so much and you know submissives
are always looking for a dominant like

10276
02:51:45,830 --> 02:51:45,840
are always looking for a dominant like
 

10277
02:51:45,840 --> 02:51:48,290
are always looking for a dominant like
there's it's an unequal Market holy [\h__\h]

10278
02:51:48,290 --> 02:51:48,300
there's it's an unequal Market holy [\h__\h]
 

10279
02:51:48,300 --> 02:51:50,870
there's it's an unequal Market holy [\h__\h]
yeah this is great news

10280
02:51:50,870 --> 02:51:50,880
yeah this is great news
 

10281
02:51:50,880 --> 02:51:52,790
yeah this is great news
I didn't know this that's interesting

10282
02:51:52,790 --> 02:51:52,800
I didn't know this that's interesting
 

10283
02:51:52,800 --> 02:51:55,010
I didn't know this that's interesting
yeah so what does it reflect about

10284
02:51:55,010 --> 02:51:55,020
yeah so what does it reflect about
 

10285
02:51:55,020 --> 02:51:57,170
yeah so what does it reflect about
modern society is that like uh is that

10286
02:51:57,170 --> 02:51:57,180
modern society is that like uh is that
 

10287
02:51:57,180 --> 02:51:58,429
modern society is that like uh is that
because you know there's these Trends

10288
02:51:58,429 --> 02:51:58,439
because you know there's these Trends
 

10289
02:51:58,439 --> 02:52:00,349
because you know there's these Trends
about like decreased masculinity or that

10290
02:52:00,349 --> 02:52:00,359
about like decreased masculinity or that
 

10291
02:52:00,359 --> 02:52:02,150
about like decreased masculinity or that
yeah so is that reflect is that that's

10292
02:52:02,150 --> 02:52:02,160
yeah so is that reflect is that that's
 

10293
02:52:02,160 --> 02:52:03,830
yeah so is that reflect is that that's
so much similar I'm trying not to hold

10294
02:52:03,830 --> 02:52:03,840
so much similar I'm trying not to hold
 

10295
02:52:03,840 --> 02:52:05,210
so much similar I'm trying not to hold
on to one Theory because I'm not sure

10296
02:52:05,210 --> 02:52:05,220
on to one Theory because I'm not sure
 

10297
02:52:05,220 --> 02:52:06,830
on to one Theory because I'm not sure
one is possible like decreasing

10298
02:52:06,830 --> 02:52:06,840
one is possible like decreasing
 

10299
02:52:06,840 --> 02:52:08,510
one is possible like decreasing
testosterone levels

10300
02:52:08,510 --> 02:52:08,520
testosterone levels
 

10301
02:52:08,520 --> 02:52:10,370
testosterone levels
um testosterone seems to be I have a

10302
02:52:10,370 --> 02:52:10,380
um testosterone seems to be I have a
 

10303
02:52:10,380 --> 02:52:11,690
um testosterone seems to be I have a
little bit of other research but I'm

10304
02:52:11,690 --> 02:52:11,700
little bit of other research but I'm
 

10305
02:52:11,700 --> 02:52:13,190
little bit of other research but I'm
still checking it out that seems to

10306
02:52:13,190 --> 02:52:13,200
still checking it out that seems to
 

10307
02:52:13,200 --> 02:52:14,750
still checking it out that seems to
indicate that uh higher testosterone

10308
02:52:14,750 --> 02:52:14,760
indicate that uh higher testosterone
 

10309
02:52:14,760 --> 02:52:16,490
indicate that uh higher testosterone
you're more likely to be dominant so if

10310
02:52:16,490 --> 02:52:16,500
you're more likely to be dominant so if
 

10311
02:52:16,500 --> 02:52:17,809
you're more likely to be dominant so if
we're seeing decreased testosterone

10312
02:52:17,809 --> 02:52:17,819
we're seeing decreased testosterone
 

10313
02:52:17,819 --> 02:52:19,309
we're seeing decreased testosterone
levels across Society where it should be

10314
02:52:19,309 --> 02:52:19,319
levels across Society where it should be
 

10315
02:52:19,319 --> 02:52:22,070
levels across Society where it should be
seeing a greater uh Gap

10316
02:52:22,070 --> 02:52:22,080
seeing a greater uh Gap
 

10317
02:52:22,080 --> 02:52:24,110
seeing a greater uh Gap
um this is so fascinating once again

10318
02:52:24,110 --> 02:52:24,120
um this is so fascinating once again
 

10319
02:52:24,120 --> 02:52:26,150
um this is so fascinating once again
this is like a super interesting way to

10320
02:52:26,150 --> 02:52:26,160
this is like a super interesting way to
 

10321
02:52:26,160 --> 02:52:28,250
this is like a super interesting way to
look at Humanity because it is such an

10322
02:52:28,250 --> 02:52:28,260
look at Humanity because it is such an
 

10323
02:52:28,260 --> 02:52:30,230
look at Humanity because it is such an
important part of humanity and so like

10324
02:52:30,230 --> 02:52:30,240
important part of humanity and so like
 

10325
02:52:30,240 --> 02:52:31,910
important part of humanity and so like
how many people are doing large-scale

10326
02:52:31,910 --> 02:52:31,920
how many people are doing large-scale
 

10327
02:52:31,920 --> 02:52:34,130
how many people are doing large-scale
research like this I feel like you're

10328
02:52:34,130 --> 02:52:34,140
research like this I feel like you're
 

10329
02:52:34,140 --> 02:52:36,170
research like this I feel like you're
like at the top of the world you're like

10330
02:52:36,170 --> 02:52:36,180
like at the top of the world you're like
 

10331
02:52:36,180 --> 02:52:37,670
like at the top of the world you're like
world class at the top of the world

10332
02:52:37,670 --> 02:52:37,680
world class at the top of the world
 

10333
02:52:37,680 --> 02:52:39,410
world class at the top of the world
doing research on this stuff yeah I

10334
02:52:39,410 --> 02:52:39,420
doing research on this stuff yeah I
 

10335
02:52:39,420 --> 02:52:40,910
doing research on this stuff yeah I
think I might have the biggest most

10336
02:52:40,910 --> 02:52:40,920
think I might have the biggest most
 

10337
02:52:40,920 --> 02:52:43,490
think I might have the biggest most
comprehensive fetish data set in the

10338
02:52:43,490 --> 02:52:43,500
comprehensive fetish data set in the
 

10339
02:52:43,500 --> 02:52:45,610
comprehensive fetish data set in the
world right now

10340
02:52:45,610 --> 02:52:45,620
world right now
 

10341
02:52:45,620 --> 02:52:48,650
world right now
that's epic thank you I'm really happy

10342
02:52:48,650 --> 02:52:48,660
that's epic thank you I'm really happy
 

10343
02:52:48,660 --> 02:52:51,650
that's epic thank you I'm really happy
about it I'm very proud yeah and it's

10344
02:52:51,650 --> 02:52:51,660
about it I'm very proud yeah and it's
 

10345
02:52:51,660 --> 02:52:53,630
about it I'm very proud yeah and it's
you know it's it's probably growing but

10346
02:52:53,630 --> 02:52:53,640
you know it's it's probably growing but
 

10347
02:52:53,640 --> 02:52:55,429
you know it's it's probably growing but
it's also enabling you to establish a

10348
02:52:55,429 --> 02:52:55,439
it's also enabling you to establish a
 

10349
02:52:55,439 --> 02:52:58,250
it's also enabling you to establish a
name to where you like a Prestige like a

10350
02:52:58,250 --> 02:52:58,260
name to where you like a Prestige like a
 

10351
02:52:58,260 --> 02:52:59,870
name to where you like a Prestige like a
reputation to where people can go to you

10352
02:52:59,870 --> 02:52:59,880
reputation to where people can go to you
 

10353
02:52:59,880 --> 02:53:01,969
reputation to where people can go to you
to like trust you more and more to do

10354
02:53:01,969 --> 02:53:01,979
to like trust you more and more to do
 

10355
02:53:01,979 --> 02:53:03,710
to like trust you more and more to do
longer surveys perhaps

10356
02:53:03,710 --> 02:53:03,720
longer surveys perhaps
 

10357
02:53:03,720 --> 02:53:05,990
longer surveys perhaps
like yeah maybe I think people it's the

10358
02:53:05,990 --> 02:53:06,000
like yeah maybe I think people it's the
 

10359
02:53:06,000 --> 02:53:08,030
like yeah maybe I think people it's the
date the data analysis afterwards is

10360
02:53:08,030 --> 02:53:08,040
date the data analysis afterwards is
 

10361
02:53:08,040 --> 02:53:09,170
date the data analysis afterwards is
very different from like the survey

10362
02:53:09,170 --> 02:53:09,180
very different from like the survey
 

10363
02:53:09,180 --> 02:53:10,429
very different from like the survey
design itself

10364
02:53:10,429 --> 02:53:10,439
design itself
 

10365
02:53:10,439 --> 02:53:13,730
design itself
so I'm still very amateur at the data

10366
02:53:13,730 --> 02:53:13,740
so I'm still very amateur at the data
 

10367
02:53:13,740 --> 02:53:15,530
so I'm still very amateur at the data
analysis yeah but you can always catch

10368
02:53:15,530 --> 02:53:15,540
analysis yeah but you can always catch
 

10369
02:53:15,540 --> 02:53:17,330
analysis yeah but you can always catch
up on that I guess the data analysis

10370
02:53:17,330 --> 02:53:17,340
up on that I guess the data analysis
 

10371
02:53:17,340 --> 02:53:19,849
up on that I guess the data analysis
does enable you to does teach you how to

10372
02:53:19,849 --> 02:53:19,859
does enable you to does teach you how to
 

10373
02:53:19,859 --> 02:53:22,010
does enable you to does teach you how to
ask better questions in order yes it

10374
02:53:22,010 --> 02:53:22,020
ask better questions in order yes it
 

10375
02:53:22,020 --> 02:53:23,330
ask better questions in order yes it
goes back and forth like as I'm looking

10376
02:53:23,330 --> 02:53:23,340
goes back and forth like as I'm looking
 

10377
02:53:23,340 --> 02:53:25,370
goes back and forth like as I'm looking
at the data it informs the way I want to

10378
02:53:25,370 --> 02:53:25,380
at the data it informs the way I want to
 

10379
02:53:25,380 --> 02:53:27,530
at the data it informs the way I want to
phrase questions the next time so women

10380
02:53:27,530 --> 02:53:27,540
phrase questions the next time so women
 

10381
02:53:27,540 --> 02:53:30,290
phrase questions the next time so women
are more at least in private able to

10382
02:53:30,290 --> 02:53:30,300
are more at least in private able to
 

10383
02:53:30,300 --> 02:53:32,269
are more at least in private able to
uh say that they would like to be

10384
02:53:32,269 --> 02:53:32,279
uh say that they would like to be
 

10385
02:53:32,279 --> 02:53:34,670
uh say that they would like to be
submissive and Men even in private are

10386
02:53:34,670 --> 02:53:34,680
submissive and Men even in private are
 

10387
02:53:34,680 --> 02:53:36,190
submissive and Men even in private are
not

10388
02:53:36,190 --> 02:53:36,200
not
 

10389
02:53:36,200 --> 02:53:38,150
not
disproportionately saying they're not

10390
02:53:38,150 --> 02:53:38,160
disproportionately saying they're not
 

10391
02:53:38,160 --> 02:53:40,250
disproportionately saying they're not
willing to be dominant

10392
02:53:40,250 --> 02:53:40,260
willing to be dominant
 

10393
02:53:40,260 --> 02:53:43,130
willing to be dominant
yeah so it's possible if this is caused

10394
02:53:43,130 --> 02:53:43,140
yeah so it's possible if this is caused
 

10395
02:53:43,140 --> 02:53:44,570
yeah so it's possible if this is caused
by decreasing testosterone levels and

10396
02:53:44,570 --> 02:53:44,580
by decreasing testosterone levels and
 

10397
02:53:44,580 --> 02:53:45,590
by decreasing testosterone levels and
this means that we're probably having

10398
02:53:45,590 --> 02:53:45,600
this means that we're probably having
 

10399
02:53:45,600 --> 02:53:47,510
this means that we're probably having
less satisfying sex overall like we're

10400
02:53:47,510 --> 02:53:47,520
less satisfying sex overall like we're
 

10401
02:53:47,520 --> 02:53:48,530
less satisfying sex overall like we're
becoming less and less sexually

10402
02:53:48,530 --> 02:53:48,540
becoming less and less sexually
 

10403

the gene pool to be but to be assistants
 

10419
02:54:03,300 --> 02:54:05,269
the gene pool to be but to be assistants
and like it's possible that like there's

10420

would consider this and so I put a whole
bunch of different gray uh scenarios uh

10496

bunch of different gray uh scenarios uh
 

10497

I mean uh this is nuanced and difficult
 

10589
02:57:12,120 --> 02:57:14,990

public discourse the word rape is pretty
 

10593
02:57:16,859 --> 02:57:19,370
public discourse the word rape is pretty
binary yeah it's like either one is or

10594
02:57:19,370 --> 02:57:19,380
binary yeah it's like either one is or
 

10595
02:57:19,380 --> 02:57:21,650
binary yeah it's like either one is or
is not rape and so you had a friend

yeah she's like confused about how to
 

10601
02:57:25,260 --> 02:57:27,530
yeah she's like confused about how to
interpret it I think people look to the

10602
02:57:27,530 --> 02:57:27,540
interpret it I think people look to the
 

10603
02:57:27,540 --> 02:57:28,969
interpret it I think people look to the
terms to know how to feel about

10604
02:57:28,969 --> 02:57:28,979
terms to know how to feel about
 

10605
02:57:28,979 --> 02:57:30,469
terms to know how to feel about
something yeah like have you ever like

10606
02:57:30,469 --> 02:57:30,479
something yeah like have you ever like
 

10607
02:57:30,479 --> 02:57:31,730
something yeah like have you ever like
been through an experience you're like

10608
02:57:31,730 --> 02:57:31,740
been through an experience you're like
 

10609
02:57:31,740 --> 02:57:32,929
been through an experience you're like
that was weird and then you tell it to

10610
02:57:32,929 --> 02:57:32,939
that was weird and then you tell it to
 

10611
02:57:32,939 --> 02:57:34,130
that was weird and then you tell it to
somebody else and they're like oh my God

10612
02:57:34,130 --> 02:57:34,140
somebody else and they're like oh my God
 

10613
02:57:34,140 --> 02:57:36,290
somebody else and they're like oh my God
you were assaulted yeah and then it

10614
02:57:36,290 --> 02:57:36,300
you were assaulted yeah and then it
 

10615
02:57:36,300 --> 02:57:38,210
you were assaulted yeah and then it
totally recontextualizes the thing that

10616
02:57:38,210 --> 02:57:38,220
totally recontextualizes the thing that
 

10617
02:57:38,220 --> 02:57:40,190
totally recontextualizes the thing that
you've experienced and I think that this

10618
02:57:40,190 --> 02:57:40,200
you've experienced and I think that this
 

10619
02:57:40,200 --> 02:57:41,630
you've experienced and I think that this
is clunky with the word rape because

10620
02:57:41,630 --> 02:57:41,640
is clunky with the word rape because
 

10621
02:57:41,640 --> 02:57:43,610
is clunky with the word rape because
either you were raped or you're not you

10622
02:57:43,610 --> 02:57:43,620
either you were raped or you're not you
 

10623
02:57:43,620 --> 02:57:45,530
either you were raped or you're not you
either like have this entire context

10624
02:57:45,530 --> 02:57:45,540
either like have this entire context
 

10625
02:57:45,540 --> 02:57:47,570
either like have this entire context
like thrust upon you or you don't and

10626
02:57:47,570 --> 02:57:47,580
like thrust upon you or you don't and
 

10627
02:57:47,580 --> 02:57:49,849
like thrust upon you or you don't and
we're really noticed about it at all and

10628
02:57:49,849 --> 02:57:49,859
we're really noticed about it at all and
 

10629
02:57:49,859 --> 02:57:51,170
we're really noticed about it at all and
so I would really like to have some sort

10630
02:57:51,170 --> 02:57:51,180
so I would really like to have some sort
 

10631
02:57:51,180 --> 02:57:53,030
so I would really like to have some sort
of like oh that was like a 30 rape you

10632
02:57:53,030 --> 02:57:53,040
of like oh that was like a 30 rape you
 

10633
02:57:53,040 --> 02:57:54,670
of like oh that was like a 30 rape you
just endured

10634
02:57:54,670 --> 02:57:54,680
just endured
 

10635
02:57:54,680 --> 02:57:56,870
just endured
yeah and I mean there's probably other

10636
02:57:56,870 --> 02:57:56,880
yeah and I mean there's probably other
 

10637
02:57:56,880 --> 02:57:58,849
yeah and I mean there's probably other
dimensions about how traumatic it is how

10638
02:57:58,849 --> 02:57:58,859
dimensions about how traumatic it is how
 

10639
02:57:58,859 --> 02:58:00,950
dimensions about how traumatic it is how
difficult it is to recover from all that

10640
02:58:00,950 --> 02:58:00,960
difficult it is to recover from all that
 

10641
02:58:00,960 --> 02:58:02,269
difficult it is to recover from all that
kind of stuff

10642
02:58:02,269 --> 02:58:02,279
kind of stuff
 

10643
02:58:02,279 --> 02:58:04,670
kind of stuff
yeah I mean like people it's a dangerous

10644
02:58:04,670 --> 02:58:04,680
yeah I mean like people it's a dangerous
 

10645
02:58:04,680 --> 02:58:06,349
yeah I mean like people it's a dangerous
thing to assign a word to to an

10646
02:58:06,349 --> 02:58:06,359
thing to assign a word to to an
 

10647
02:58:06,359 --> 02:58:08,450
thing to assign a word to to an
experience like even or to a

10648
02:58:08,450 --> 02:58:08,460
experience like even or to a
 

10649
02:58:08,460 --> 02:58:09,950
experience like even or to a
relationship like saying a toxic

10650
02:58:09,950 --> 02:58:09,960
relationship like saying a toxic
 

10651
02:58:09,960 --> 02:58:11,269
relationship like saying a toxic
relationship

10652
02:58:11,269 --> 02:58:11,279
relationship
 

10653
02:58:11,279 --> 02:58:13,730
relationship
yeah that can completely destroy your

10654
02:58:13,730 --> 02:58:13,740
yeah that can completely destroy your
 

10655
02:58:13,740 --> 02:58:15,469
yeah that can completely destroy your
perception of that relationship

10656
02:58:15,469 --> 02:58:15,479
perception of that relationship
 

10657
02:58:15,479 --> 02:58:17,450
perception of that relationship
yeah absolutely I remember this was the

10658
02:58:17,450 --> 02:58:17,460
yeah absolutely I remember this was the
 

10659

10663
02:58:19,920 --> 02:58:21,410
about being very abusive but I've talked
about how like there's a good amount of

10664
02:58:21,410 --> 02:58:21,420
about how like there's a good amount of
 

10665
02:58:21,420 --> 02:58:23,269
about how like there's a good amount of
meaning there so that I didn't process

10666
02:58:23,269 --> 02:58:23,279
meaning there so that I didn't process
 

10667
02:58:23,279 --> 02:58:25,070
meaning there so that I didn't process
it as abusive at the time I remember

10668
02:58:25,070 --> 02:58:25,080
it as abusive at the time I remember
 

10669
02:58:25,080 --> 02:58:27,050
it as abusive at the time I remember
after I got out of that house in that

really confused by that because it's a
 

10677
02:58:32,580 --> 02:58:34,670
really confused by that because it's a
total re-contextualization of that

10678
02:58:34,670 --> 02:58:34,680
total re-contextualization of that

hard for me it made it worse like it's

10708
02:59:03,710 --> 02:59:03,720
hard for me it made it worse like it's
 

10709
02:59:03,720 --> 02:59:05,990
hard for me it made it worse like it's
crazy the power that terms have

10710
02:59:05,990 --> 02:59:06,000
crazy the power that terms have
 

10711
02:59:06,000 --> 02:59:08,090
crazy the power that terms have
I think we didn't talk about this but

10712
02:59:08,090 --> 02:59:08,100
I think we didn't talk about this but
 

10713
02:59:08,100 --> 02:59:09,650
I think we didn't talk about this but

how did you how did you begin to
overcome

10716
02:59:10,969 --> 02:59:10,979
overcome
 

10717
02:59:10,979 --> 02:59:13,790
overcome
uh the the trauma of your childhood you

10718
02:59:13,790 --> 02:59:13,800
uh the the trauma of your childhood you
 

10719
02:59:13,800 --> 02:59:15,590
uh the the trauma of your childhood you
mentioned LSD so drugs are part of it

10720
02:59:15,590 --> 02:59:15,600
mentioned LSD so drugs are part of it
 

10721
02:59:15,600 --> 02:59:16,910
mentioned LSD so drugs are part of it
like what was the just the mental

10722
02:59:16,910 --> 02:59:16,920
like what was the just the mental
 

10723
02:59:16,920 --> 02:59:18,110
like what was the just the mental
journey of that

10724
02:59:18,110 --> 02:59:18,120
journey of that
 

10725
02:59:18,120 --> 02:59:20,110
journey of that
I was doing LCD quite a lot when I was

10726
02:59:20,110 --> 02:59:20,120
I was doing LCD quite a lot when I was
 

10727
02:59:20,120 --> 02:59:22,790
I was doing LCD quite a lot when I was
21. what's it like by the way I've never

10728
02:59:22,790 --> 02:59:22,800
21. what's it like by the way I've never
 

10729
02:59:22,800 --> 02:59:24,950
21. what's it like by the way I've never
done lsues what's it very difficult to

10730
02:59:24,950 --> 02:59:24,960
done lsues what's it very difficult to
 

10731
02:59:24,960 --> 02:59:27,650
done lsues what's it very difficult to
describe because it's like like it

10732
02:59:27,650 --> 02:59:27,660
describe because it's like like it
 

10733
02:59:27,660 --> 02:59:30,110
describe because it's like like it
changes sort of aspects about your

10734
02:59:30,110 --> 02:59:30,120
changes sort of aspects about your
 

10735
02:59:30,120 --> 02:59:31,490
changes sort of aspects about your
environment that are invisible to you

10736
02:59:31,490 --> 02:59:31,500
environment that are invisible to you
 

10737
02:59:31,500 --> 02:59:32,990
environment that are invisible to you
because they're so stable

10738
02:59:32,990 --> 02:59:33,000
because they're so stable
 

10739
02:59:33,000 --> 02:59:35,330
because they're so stable
is it like if you can compare it to like

10740
02:59:35,330 --> 02:59:35,340
is it like if you can compare it to like
 

10741
02:59:35,340 --> 02:59:37,670
is it like if you can compare it to like
psilocybin is it very different oh yeah

10742
02:59:37,670 --> 02:59:37,680
psilocybin is it very different oh yeah
 

10743
02:59:37,680 --> 02:59:39,769
psilocybin is it very different oh yeah
uh it's like similar I forgot that you

10744
02:59:39,769 --> 02:59:39,779
uh it's like similar I forgot that you
 

10745
02:59:39,779 --> 02:59:41,090
uh it's like similar I forgot that you
did shrooms yeah okay that you probably

10746
02:59:41,090 --> 02:59:41,100
did shrooms yeah okay that you probably
 

10747
02:59:41,100 --> 02:59:42,530
did shrooms yeah okay that you probably
know you know like the kind of shift

10748
02:59:42,530 --> 02:59:42,540
know you know like the kind of shift
 

10749
02:59:42,540 --> 02:59:44,330
know you know like the kind of shift
that you have from cyber dish rooms is

10750
02:59:44,330 --> 02:59:44,340
that you have from cyber dish rooms is
 

10751
02:59:44,340 --> 02:59:46,490
that you have from cyber dish rooms is
roughly similar it's like more clear I

10752
02:59:46,490 --> 02:59:46,500
roughly similar it's like more clear I
 

10753
02:59:46,500 --> 02:59:48,590
roughly similar it's like more clear I
think shrooms is more like embodied but

10754
02:59:48,590 --> 02:59:48,600
think shrooms is more like embodied but
 

10755
02:59:48,600 --> 02:59:50,570
think shrooms is more like embodied but
it LSD is much more intellectual for me

10756
02:59:50,570 --> 02:59:50,580
it LSD is much more intellectual for me
 

10757
02:59:50,580 --> 02:59:52,309
it LSD is much more intellectual for me
it strikes different people differently

10758
02:59:52,309 --> 02:59:52,319
it strikes different people differently
 

10759
02:59:52,319 --> 02:59:54,170
it strikes different people differently
I prefer shrooms a lot I'm sorry LSD

10760
02:59:54,170 --> 02:59:54,180
I prefer shrooms a lot I'm sorry LSD
 

10761
02:59:54,180 --> 02:59:56,450
I prefer shrooms a lot I'm sorry LSD
real estate a lot why is it not

10762
02:59:56,450 --> 02:59:56,460
real estate a lot why is it not
 

10763
02:59:56,460 --> 02:59:59,330
real estate a lot why is it not
popularly take like there seems to be a

10764
02:59:59,330 --> 02:59:59,340
popularly take like there seems to be a
 

10765
02:59:59,340 --> 03:00:01,070
popularly take like there seems to be a
negative connotation to LSD because like

10766
03:00:01,070 --> 03:00:01,080
negative connotation to LSD because like
 

10767
03:00:01,080 --> 03:00:03,710
negative connotation to LSD because like
it seems to potentially have like a

10768
03:00:03,710 --> 03:00:03,720
it seems to potentially have like a
 

10769
03:00:03,720 --> 03:00:05,929
it seems to potentially have like a
destructive effect like maybe dosage is

10770
03:00:05,929 --> 03:00:05,939
destructive effect like maybe dosage is
 

10771
03:00:05,939 --> 03:00:07,370
destructive effect like maybe dosage is
more difficult to get right or something

10772
03:00:07,370 --> 03:00:07,380
more difficult to get right or something
 

10773
03:00:07,380 --> 03:00:09,050
more difficult to get right or something
like that does this exactly

10774
03:00:09,050 --> 03:00:09,060
like that does this exactly
 

10775
03:00:09,060 --> 03:00:10,730
like that does this exactly
a long time ago I did a survey on

10776
03:00:10,730 --> 03:00:10,740
a long time ago I did a survey on
 

10777
03:00:10,740 --> 03:00:13,130
a long time ago I did a survey on
streams versus LSD so I asked people and

10778
03:00:13,130 --> 03:00:13,140
streams versus LSD so I asked people and
 

10779
03:00:13,140 --> 03:00:14,690
streams versus LSD so I asked people and
people had slightly stronger experiences

10780
03:00:14,690 --> 03:00:14,700
people had slightly stronger experiences
 

10781
03:00:14,700 --> 03:00:16,849
people had slightly stronger experiences
on LCD overall I remember but rated the

10782
03:00:16,849 --> 03:00:16,859
on LCD overall I remember but rated the
 

10783
03:00:16,859 --> 03:00:19,490
on LCD overall I remember but rated the
experience is about is equally good

10784
03:00:19,490 --> 03:00:19,500
experience is about is equally good
 

10785
03:00:19,500 --> 03:00:20,690
experience is about is equally good
um but I think people like streams

10786
03:00:20,690 --> 03:00:20,700
um but I think people like streams
 

10787
03:00:20,700 --> 03:00:21,469
um but I think people like streams
because it feels more natural

10788
03:00:21,469 --> 03:00:21,479
because it feels more natural
 

10789
03:00:21,479 --> 03:00:23,570
because it feels more natural
quote-unquote but I think if you like

10790
03:00:23,570 --> 03:00:23,580
quote-unquote but I think if you like
 

10791
03:00:23,580 --> 03:00:25,309
quote-unquote but I think if you like
fed somebody a shroom and like actually

10792
03:00:25,309 --> 03:00:25,319
fed somebody a shroom and like actually
 

10793
03:00:25,319 --> 03:00:26,809
fed somebody a shroom and like actually
had the LSD molecule in it they would

10794
03:00:26,809 --> 03:00:26,819
had the LSD molecule in it they would
 

10795
03:00:26,819 --> 03:00:28,070
had the LSD molecule in it they would
have a they would think it felt very

10796
03:00:28,070 --> 03:00:28,080
have a they would think it felt very
 

10797
03:00:28,080 --> 03:00:30,170
have a they would think it felt very
natural but that's besides the point I I

10798
03:00:30,170 --> 03:00:30,180
natural but that's besides the point I I
 

10799
03:00:30,180 --> 03:00:32,210
natural but that's besides the point I I
like I think people get kind of

10800
03:00:32,210 --> 03:00:32,220
like I think people get kind of
 

10801
03:00:32,220 --> 03:00:34,550
like I think people get kind of
incoherent on LSD in a way that feels

10802
03:00:34,550 --> 03:00:34,560
incoherent on LSD in a way that feels
 

10803
03:00:34,560 --> 03:00:37,490
incoherent on LSD in a way that feels
really alienating like I consider LCD my

10804
03:00:37,490 --> 03:00:37,500
really alienating like I consider LCD my
 

10805
03:00:37,500 --> 03:00:39,410
really alienating like I consider LCD my
LCD use very heavy to be one of the best

10806
03:00:39,410 --> 03:00:39,420
LCD use very heavy to be one of the best
 

10807
03:00:39,420 --> 03:00:41,090
LCD use very heavy to be one of the best
decisions I ever made in my life but I

10808
03:00:41,090 --> 03:00:41,100
decisions I ever made in my life but I
 

10809
03:00:41,100 --> 03:00:42,650
decisions I ever made in my life but I
definitely was incoherent for a lot of

10810
03:00:42,650 --> 03:00:42,660
definitely was incoherent for a lot of
 

10811
03:00:42,660 --> 03:00:44,630
definitely was incoherent for a lot of
it like talking about like we're all one

10812
03:00:44,630 --> 03:00:44,640
it like talking about like we're all one
 

10813
03:00:44,640 --> 03:00:47,030
it like talking about like we're all one
Consciousness everything is love man you

10814
03:00:47,030 --> 03:00:47,040
Consciousness everything is love man you
 

10815
03:00:47,040 --> 03:00:48,290
Consciousness everything is love man you
know and people are like is that

10816
03:00:48,290 --> 03:00:48,300
know and people are like is that
 

10817
03:00:48,300 --> 03:00:50,809
know and people are like is that
incoherent so I think it's not

10818
03:00:50,809 --> 03:00:50,819
incoherent so I think it's not
 

10819
03:00:50,819 --> 03:00:52,429
incoherent so I think it's not
incoherent but like if you go around

10820
03:00:52,429 --> 03:00:52,439
incoherent but like if you go around
 

10821
03:00:52,439 --> 03:00:54,349
incoherent but like if you go around
saying everything is love people are

10822
03:00:54,349 --> 03:00:54,359
saying everything is love people are
 

10823
03:00:54,359 --> 03:00:55,670
saying everything is love people are
like this guy's kind of blasted out of

10824
03:00:55,670 --> 03:00:55,680
like this guy's kind of blasted out of
 

10825
03:00:55,680 --> 03:00:58,389
like this guy's kind of blasted out of
his mind this podcast

10826
03:00:58,389 --> 03:00:58,399
his mind this podcast
 

10827
03:00:58,399 --> 03:01:02,510
his mind this podcast
is basically your lsdriver for a bunch

10828
03:01:02,510 --> 03:01:02,520
is basically your lsdriver for a bunch
 

10829
03:01:02,520 --> 03:01:05,210
is basically your lsdriver for a bunch
of episodes yeah I get this for sure oh

10830
03:01:05,210 --> 03:01:05,220
of episodes yeah I get this for sure oh
 

10831
03:01:05,220 --> 03:01:07,370
of episodes yeah I get this for sure oh
well well it's not just about love but

10832
03:01:07,370 --> 03:01:07,380
well well it's not just about love but
 

10833

10834
03:01:08,929 --> 03:01:08,939
it's uh
 

10835
03:01:08,939 --> 03:01:11,210
it's uh
it's about like talking in that way

10836
03:01:11,210 --> 03:01:11,220
it's about like talking in that way
 

10837
03:01:11,220 --> 03:01:13,670
it's about like talking in that way
about reality about the world yeah sure

10838
03:01:13,670 --> 03:01:13,680
about reality about the world yeah sure
 

10839
03:01:13,680 --> 03:01:15,530
about reality about the world yeah sure
it's like overfitting there's the

10840
03:01:15,530 --> 03:01:15,540
it's like overfitting there's the
 

10841
03:01:15,540 --> 03:01:16,429
it's like overfitting there's the
narratives that you make out the world

10842
03:01:16,429 --> 03:01:16,439
narratives that you make out the world
 

10843
03:01:16,439 --> 03:01:18,830
narratives that you make out the world
become really Vivid and so you pattern

10844
03:01:18,830 --> 03:01:18,840
become really Vivid and so you pattern
 

10845
03:01:18,840 --> 03:01:20,330
become really Vivid and so you pattern
match just really aggressively like

10846
03:01:20,330 --> 03:01:20,340
match just really aggressively like
 

10847
03:01:20,340 --> 03:01:22,130
match just really aggressively like
everything is connected and you come up

10848
03:01:22,130 --> 03:01:22,140
everything is connected and you come up
 

10849
03:01:22,140 --> 03:01:23,630
everything is connected and you come up
with these explanations for things and I

10850
03:01:23,630 --> 03:01:23,640
with these explanations for things and I
 

10851
03:01:23,640 --> 03:01:25,309
with these explanations for things and I
think I was very fortunate so I like

10852
03:01:25,309 --> 03:01:25,319
think I was very fortunate so I like
 

10853
03:01:25,319 --> 03:01:26,870
think I was very fortunate so I like
this theory about psychedelics where you

10854
03:01:26,870 --> 03:01:26,880
this theory about psychedelics where you
 

10855
03:01:26,880 --> 03:01:28,070
this theory about psychedelics where you
either like belief construct or you

10856
03:01:28,070 --> 03:01:28,080
either like belief construct or you
 

10857
03:01:28,080 --> 03:01:30,170
either like belief construct or you
don't so you take psychedelics and it

10858
03:01:30,170 --> 03:01:30,180
don't so you take psychedelics and it
 

10859
03:01:30,180 --> 03:01:32,210
don't so you take psychedelics and it
sort of like Burns away a lot of your

10860
03:01:32,210 --> 03:01:32,220
sort of like Burns away a lot of your
 

10861
03:01:32,220 --> 03:01:33,830
sort of like Burns away a lot of your
belief structure

10862
03:01:33,830 --> 03:01:33,840
belief structure
 

10863
03:01:33,840 --> 03:01:36,889
belief structure
um and sometimes you this happens and

10864
03:01:36,889 --> 03:01:36,899
um and sometimes you this happens and
 

10865
03:01:36,899 --> 03:01:38,210
um and sometimes you this happens and
then you're like I need to like invent

10866
03:01:38,210 --> 03:01:38,220
then you're like I need to like invent
 

10867
03:01:38,220 --> 03:01:39,769
then you're like I need to like invent
something to fill in the gaps so you're

10868
03:01:39,769 --> 03:01:39,779
something to fill in the gaps so you're
 

10869
03:01:39,779 --> 03:01:42,230
something to fill in the gaps so you're
like okay I I think that maybe uh time

10870
03:01:42,230 --> 03:01:42,240
like okay I I think that maybe uh time
 

10871
03:01:42,240 --> 03:01:44,210
like okay I I think that maybe uh time
is an illusion so I must now believe

10872
03:01:44,210 --> 03:01:44,220
is an illusion so I must now believe
 

10873
03:01:44,220 --> 03:01:46,010
is an illusion so I must now believe
that like we're actually in a Time Loop

10874
03:01:46,010 --> 03:01:46,020
that like we're actually in a Time Loop
 

10875
03:01:46,020 --> 03:01:48,349
that like we're actually in a Time Loop
or like time travel is possible so you

10876
03:01:48,349 --> 03:01:48,359
or like time travel is possible so you
 

10877
03:01:48,359 --> 03:01:49,610
or like time travel is possible so you
experience time differently and then you

10878
03:01:49,610 --> 03:01:49,620
experience time differently and then you
 

10879
03:01:49,620 --> 03:01:50,570
experience time differently and then you
come up with a different belief about

10880
03:01:50,570 --> 03:01:50,580
come up with a different belief about
 

10881
03:01:50,580 --> 03:01:53,630
come up with a different belief about
time uh whereas other people uh don't do

10882
03:01:53,630 --> 03:01:53,640
time uh whereas other people uh don't do
 

10883
03:01:53,640 --> 03:01:55,429
time uh whereas other people uh don't do
this belief construction at all like you

10884
03:01:55,429 --> 03:01:55,439
this belief construction at all like you
 

10885
03:01:55,439 --> 03:01:56,929
this belief construction at all like you
experience time differently and you sort

10886
03:01:56,929 --> 03:01:56,939
experience time differently and you sort
 

10887
03:01:56,939 --> 03:01:58,790
experience time differently and you sort
of let yourself not have a belief you're

10888
03:01:58,790 --> 03:01:58,800
of let yourself not have a belief you're
 

10889
03:01:58,800 --> 03:02:00,230
of let yourself not have a belief you're
not like okay and you're not developing

10890
03:02:00,230 --> 03:02:00,240
not like okay and you're not developing
 

10891
03:02:00,240 --> 03:02:02,090
not like okay and you're not developing
anybody's about time in its absence

10892
03:02:02,090 --> 03:02:02,100
anybody's about time in its absence
 

10893
03:02:02,100 --> 03:02:04,010
anybody's about time in its absence
you're just simply experiencing the

10894
03:02:04,010 --> 03:02:04,020
you're just simply experiencing the
 

10895
03:02:04,020 --> 03:02:06,230
you're just simply experiencing the
absence of the concept of time right uh

10896
03:02:06,230 --> 03:02:06,240
absence of the concept of time right uh
 

10897
03:02:06,240 --> 03:02:08,450
absence of the concept of time right uh
and so I I don't have a lot of data to

10898
03:02:08,450 --> 03:02:08,460
and so I I don't have a lot of data to
 

10899
03:02:08,460 --> 03:02:09,769
and so I I don't have a lot of data to
back this up in my my anecdotal

10900
03:02:09,769 --> 03:02:09,779
back this up in my my anecdotal
 

10901
03:02:09,779 --> 03:02:10,910
back this up in my my anecdotal
experience because I've trips at a lot

10902
03:02:10,910 --> 03:02:10,920
experience because I've trips at a lot
 

10903
03:02:10,920 --> 03:02:12,469
experience because I've trips at a lot
of people people either tend to believe

10904
03:02:12,469 --> 03:02:12,479
of people people either tend to believe
 

10905
03:02:12,479 --> 03:02:14,330
of people people either tend to believe
construct or they don't and people who

10906
03:02:14,330 --> 03:02:14,340
construct or they don't and people who
 

10907
03:02:14,340 --> 03:02:16,010
construct or they don't and people who
do not believe construct seem to get

10908
03:02:16,010 --> 03:02:16,020
do not believe construct seem to get
 

10909
03:02:16,020 --> 03:02:17,750
do not believe construct seem to get
more out of their LSD trips so if you

10910
03:02:17,750 --> 03:02:17,760
more out of their LSD trips so if you
 

10911
03:02:17,760 --> 03:02:19,190
more out of their LSD trips so if you
can let a belief go without building

10912
03:02:19,190 --> 03:02:19,200
can let a belief go without building
 

10913
03:02:19,200 --> 03:02:21,710
can let a belief go without building
anything in its absence it's much more

10914
03:02:21,710 --> 03:02:21,720
anything in its absence it's much more
 

10915
03:02:21,720 --> 03:02:23,269
anything in its absence it's much more
beneficial for you and I think I just

10916
03:02:23,269 --> 03:02:23,279
beneficial for you and I think I just
 

10917
03:02:23,279 --> 03:02:24,590
beneficial for you and I think I just
for some reason happen to have some

10918
03:02:24,590 --> 03:02:24,600
for some reason happen to have some
 

10919
03:02:24,600 --> 03:02:26,389
for some reason happen to have some
brain that's constructed where I don't

10920
03:02:26,389 --> 03:02:26,399
brain that's constructed where I don't
 

10921
03:02:26,399 --> 03:02:29,929
brain that's constructed where I don't
get a belief construction at all so oh

10922
03:02:29,929 --> 03:02:29,939
get a belief construction at all so oh
 

10923
03:02:29,939 --> 03:02:31,070
get a belief construction at all so oh
that's really interesting I believe

10924
03:02:31,070 --> 03:02:31,080
that's really interesting I believe
 

10925
03:02:31,080 --> 03:02:33,050
that's really interesting I believe
construction is negative

10926
03:02:33,050 --> 03:02:33,060
construction is negative
 

10927
03:02:33,060 --> 03:02:34,910
construction is negative
what

10928
03:02:34,910 --> 03:02:34,920
what
 

10929
03:02:34,920 --> 03:02:36,830
what
is it necessarily negative can you

10930
03:02:36,830 --> 03:02:36,840
is it necessarily negative can you
 

10931
03:02:36,840 --> 03:02:38,450
is it necessarily negative can you
elaborate a little bit I mean belief

10932
03:02:38,450 --> 03:02:38,460
elaborate a little bit I mean belief
 

10933
03:02:38,460 --> 03:02:40,130
elaborate a little bit I mean belief
Construction in a way that's like

10934
03:02:40,130 --> 03:02:40,140
Construction in a way that's like
 

10935
03:02:40,140 --> 03:02:41,330
Construction in a way that's like
uh

10936
03:02:41,330 --> 03:02:41,340
uh
 

10937
03:02:41,340 --> 03:02:43,730
uh
uh not like playing with frames but

10938
03:02:43,730 --> 03:02:43,740
uh not like playing with frames but
 

10939
03:02:43,740 --> 03:02:45,710
uh not like playing with frames but
rather committing to a different frame

10940
03:02:45,710 --> 03:02:45,720
rather committing to a different frame
 

10941
03:02:45,720 --> 03:02:47,690
rather committing to a different frame
so I sure I like I like being able to

10942
03:02:47,690 --> 03:02:47,700
so I sure I like I like being able to
 

10943
03:02:47,700 --> 03:02:48,830
so I sure I like I like being able to
play with ideas and be like let's look

10944
03:02:48,830 --> 03:02:48,840
play with ideas and be like let's look
 

10945
03:02:48,840 --> 03:02:49,910
play with ideas and be like let's look
at it this way or that way that's

10946
03:02:49,910 --> 03:02:49,920
at it this way or that way that's
 

10947
03:02:49,920 --> 03:02:51,950
at it this way or that way that's
awesome but if you're like okay you know

10948
03:02:51,950 --> 03:02:51,960
awesome but if you're like okay you know
 

10949
03:02:51,960 --> 03:02:53,690
awesome but if you're like okay you know
what I took LLC and now I absolutely

10950
03:02:53,690 --> 03:02:53,700
what I took LLC and now I absolutely
 

10951
03:02:53,700 --> 03:02:55,550
what I took LLC and now I absolutely
believe the cops are outside and you're

10952
03:02:55,550 --> 03:02:55,560
believe the cops are outside and you're
 

10953
03:02:55,560 --> 03:02:57,170
believe the cops are outside and you're
like dude no you're just like you you

10954
03:02:57,170 --> 03:02:57,180
like dude no you're just like you you
 

10955
03:02:57,180 --> 03:02:59,210
like dude no you're just like you you
can't shift out of that right like your

10956
03:02:59,210 --> 03:02:59,220
can't shift out of that right like your
 

10957
03:02:59,220 --> 03:03:00,650
can't shift out of that right like your
brain like needs to fill in the Gap

10958
03:03:00,650 --> 03:03:00,660
brain like needs to fill in the Gap
 

10959
03:03:00,660 --> 03:03:01,849
brain like needs to fill in the Gap
you're not allowed to have a gap so

10960
03:03:01,849 --> 03:03:01,859
you're not allowed to have a gap so
 

10961
03:03:01,859 --> 03:03:03,530
you're not allowed to have a gap so
you're not allowed to be flexible and

10962
03:03:03,530 --> 03:03:03,540
you're not allowed to be flexible and
 

10963
03:03:03,540 --> 03:03:04,849
you're not allowed to be flexible and
again I don't think this is like a

10964
03:03:04,849 --> 03:03:04,859
again I don't think this is like a
 

10965
03:03:04,859 --> 03:03:06,290
again I don't think this is like a
personal failing if any I think this is

10966
03:03:06,290 --> 03:03:06,300
personal failing if any I think this is
 

10967
03:03:06,300 --> 03:03:08,210
personal failing if any I think this is
like literally probably genetic or like

10968
03:03:08,210 --> 03:03:08,220
like literally probably genetic or like
 

10969
03:03:08,220 --> 03:03:10,010
like literally probably genetic or like
physical thing that's causing this but

10970
03:03:10,010 --> 03:03:10,020
physical thing that's causing this but
 

10971
03:03:10,020 --> 03:03:11,150
physical thing that's causing this but
do you think there's possible beliefs

10972
03:03:11,150 --> 03:03:11,160
do you think there's possible beliefs
 

10973
03:03:11,160 --> 03:03:13,429
do you think there's possible beliefs
that are like enlightening that you can

10974
03:03:13,429 --> 03:03:13,439
that are like enlightening that you can
 

10975
03:03:13,439 --> 03:03:15,290
that are like enlightening that you can
stick to like find a frame

10976
03:03:15,290 --> 03:03:15,300
stick to like find a frame
 

10977
03:03:15,300 --> 03:03:18,110
stick to like find a frame
that like

10978
03:03:18,110 --> 03:03:18,120
that like
 

10979
03:03:18,120 --> 03:03:19,969
that like
I guess if you don't believe

10980
03:03:19,969 --> 03:03:19,979
I guess if you don't believe
 

10981
03:03:19,979 --> 03:03:21,650
I guess if you don't believe
constructing you're escaping your

10982
03:03:21,650 --> 03:03:21,660
constructing you're escaping your
 

10983
03:03:21,660 --> 03:03:23,210
constructing you're escaping your
previous beliefs aren't you doing like

10984
03:03:23,210 --> 03:03:23,220
previous beliefs aren't you doing like
 

10985
03:03:23,220 --> 03:03:24,950
previous beliefs aren't you doing like
just some you're picking up a bigger

10986
03:03:24,950 --> 03:03:24,960
just some you're picking up a bigger
 

10987
03:03:24,960 --> 03:03:25,790
just some you're picking up a bigger
frame

10988
03:03:25,790 --> 03:03:25,800
frame
 

10989
03:03:25,800 --> 03:03:27,170
frame
yeah in some way you're taking your

10990
03:03:27,170 --> 03:03:27,180
yeah in some way you're taking your
 

10991
03:03:27,180 --> 03:03:29,150
yeah in some way you're taking your
beliefs as object as opposed to being

10992
03:03:29,150 --> 03:03:29,160
beliefs as object as opposed to being
 

10993
03:03:29,160 --> 03:03:31,370
beliefs as object as opposed to being
subject to them ah got it got it got it

10994
03:03:31,370 --> 03:03:31,380
subject to them ah got it got it got it
 

10995
03:03:31,380 --> 03:03:32,929
subject to them ah got it got it got it
got it and some of that I guess is

10996
03:03:32,929 --> 03:03:32,939
got it and some of that I guess is
 

10997
03:03:32,939 --> 03:03:34,370
got it and some of that I guess is
genetic and there's these categories of

10998
03:03:34,370 --> 03:03:34,380
genetic and there's these categories of
 

10999
03:03:34,380 --> 03:03:35,690
genetic and there's these categories of
people there's two categories that

11000
03:03:35,690 --> 03:03:35,700
people there's two categories that
 

11001
03:03:35,700 --> 03:03:37,550
people there's two categories that
experience LSD in different ways yeah

11002
03:03:37,550 --> 03:03:37,560
experience LSD in different ways yeah
 

11003
03:03:37,560 --> 03:03:38,870
experience LSD in different ways yeah
and you're one of those that are able to

11004
03:03:38,870 --> 03:03:38,880
and you're one of those that are able to
 

11005
03:03:38,880 --> 03:03:40,370
and you're one of those that are able to
just let go yeah I just think I had a

11006
03:03:40,370 --> 03:03:40,380
just let go yeah I just think I had a
 

11007
03:03:40,380 --> 03:03:41,809
just let go yeah I just think I had a
good reaction and I think a lot of maybe

11008
03:03:41,809 --> 03:03:41,819
good reaction and I think a lot of maybe
 

11009
03:03:41,819 --> 03:03:44,450
good reaction and I think a lot of maybe
the negative stereotype of LSD comes

11010
03:03:44,450 --> 03:03:44,460
the negative stereotype of LSD comes
 

11011
03:03:44,460 --> 03:03:45,769

control in general because that's part

11036
03:04:10,309 --> 03:04:10,319
control in general because that's part
 

11037
03:04:10,319 --> 03:04:13,309
control in general because that's part
of human interaction uh yeah Fame

11038
03:04:13,309 --> 03:04:13,319
of human interaction uh yeah Fame
 

11039
03:04:13,319 --> 03:04:16,190
of human interaction uh yeah Fame
control is like a way of manipulating

11040
03:04:16,190 --> 03:04:16,200
control is like a way of manipulating
 

11041
03:04:16,200 --> 03:04:19,730
control is like a way of manipulating
somebody else that is non-uh obvious so

11042
03:04:19,730 --> 03:04:19,740
somebody else that is non-uh obvious so
 

11043
03:04:19,740 --> 03:04:21,230
somebody else that is non-uh obvious so
there's a negative competition to that

11044
03:04:21,230 --> 03:04:21,240
there's a negative competition to that
 

11045
03:04:21,240 --> 03:04:23,870
there's a negative competition to that
usually uh yeah I mean I think maybe I

11046
03:04:23,870 --> 03:04:23,880
usually uh yeah I mean I think maybe I
 

11047
03:04:23,880 --> 03:04:25,429
usually uh yeah I mean I think maybe I
chose the term kind of poorly because I

11048
03:04:25,429 --> 03:04:25,439
chose the term kind of poorly because I
 

11049
03:04:25,439 --> 03:04:27,050
chose the term kind of poorly because I
think to some degree people are always a

11050
03:04:27,050 --> 03:04:27,060
think to some degree people are always a
 

11051
03:04:27,060 --> 03:04:28,730
think to some degree people are always a
little bit manipulating each other but I

11052
03:04:28,730 --> 03:04:28,740
little bit manipulating each other but I
 

11053
03:04:28,740 --> 03:04:29,990
little bit manipulating each other but I
think it's generally obvious like for

11054
03:04:29,990 --> 03:04:30,000
think it's generally obvious like for
 

11055
03:04:30,000 --> 03:04:31,849
think it's generally obvious like for

this is like an obvious thing that is
 

11061
03:04:35,399 --> 03:04:36,769
this is like an obvious thing that is
like visible between it's like an object

11062
03:04:36,769 --> 03:04:36,779
like visible between it's like an object
 

11063
03:04:36,779 --> 03:04:38,510
like visible between it's like an object
on the table it's like here's the box

11064
03:04:38,510 --> 03:04:38,520
on the table it's like here's the box

disagreement box yes like right like
 

11069
03:04:43,560 --> 03:04:45,290
disagreement box yes like right like
we're under a shared context where we

11070
03:04:45,290 --> 03:04:45,300
we're under a shared context where we

using tactics to try to influence what
 

11089
03:05:03,779 --> 03:05:06,650
using tactics to try to influence what
your reality is without us being both

facial expressions like it's kind of off
 

11111
03:05:25,260 --> 03:05:27,290
facial expressions like it's kind of off
like this doesn't seem to match emotions

11112
03:05:27,290 --> 03:05:27,300
like this doesn't seem to match emotions
 

11113
03:05:27,300 --> 03:05:29,210
like this doesn't seem to match emotions
but it's kind of intelligent seemingly

11114
03:05:29,210 --> 03:05:29,220
but it's kind of intelligent seemingly
 

11115
03:05:29,220 --> 03:05:31,670
but it's kind of intelligent seemingly
but definitely not conscious anyway so

11116
03:05:31,670 --> 03:05:31,680
but definitely not conscious anyway so
 

11117
03:05:31,680 --> 03:05:33,969
but definitely not conscious anyway so
like uh negative connotation

11118
03:05:33,969 --> 03:05:33,979
like uh negative connotation
 

11119
03:05:33,979 --> 03:05:36,830

manipulating right not being honest

11120
03:05:36,830 --> 03:05:36,840
manipulating right not being honest
 

11121
03:05:36,840 --> 03:05:40,370
manipulating right not being honest
about the actual intentions of the uh

11122
03:05:40,370 --> 03:05:40,380
about the actual intentions of the uh
 

11123
03:05:40,380 --> 03:05:43,070
about the actual intentions of the uh
yeah of how you'd like to to control the

11124
03:05:43,070 --> 03:05:43,080
yeah of how you'd like to to control the
 

11125
03:05:43,080 --> 03:05:44,210
yeah of how you'd like to to control the
conversation I think there like might be

11126
03:05:44,210 --> 03:05:44,220
conversation I think there like might be
 

11127
03:05:44,220 --> 03:05:45,650
conversation I think there like might be
a naive version of interpreting this

11128
03:05:45,650 --> 03:05:45,660
a naive version of interpreting this
 

11129
03:05:45,660 --> 03:05:47,210
a naive version of interpreting this
where you're just like oh I'm trying to

11130
03:05:47,210 --> 03:05:47,220
where you're just like oh I'm trying to
 

11131
03:05:47,220 --> 03:05:49,010
where you're just like oh I'm trying to
like subtly get you to you know believe

11132
03:05:49,010 --> 03:05:49,020
like subtly get you to you know believe
 

11133
03:05:49,020 --> 03:05:50,750
like subtly get you to you know believe
like oh do you really think that's bad

11134
03:05:50,750 --> 03:05:50,760
like oh do you really think that's bad
 

11135
03:05:50,760 --> 03:05:52,550
like oh do you really think that's bad
though but this is not quite what I mean

11136
03:05:52,550 --> 03:05:52,560
though but this is not quite what I mean
 

11137
03:05:52,560 --> 03:05:54,170
though but this is not quite what I mean
I mean it's like a couple of concrete

11138
03:05:54,170 --> 03:05:54,180
I mean it's like a couple of concrete
 

11139
03:05:54,180 --> 03:05:55,790
I mean it's like a couple of concrete
things that are signs of frame control

11140
03:05:55,790 --> 03:05:55,800
things that are signs of frame control
 

11141
03:05:55,800 --> 03:05:56,929
things that are signs of frame control
um like one of them is pushing the

11142
03:05:56,929 --> 03:05:56,939
um like one of them is pushing the
 

11143
03:05:56,939 --> 03:05:58,370
um like one of them is pushing the
painful update button

11144
03:05:58,370 --> 03:05:58,380
painful update button
 

11145
03:05:58,380 --> 03:05:59,889
painful update button
um which is this thing where it's like

11146
03:05:59,889 --> 03:05:59,899
um which is this thing where it's like
 

11147
03:05:59,899 --> 03:06:03,830
um which is this thing where it's like
uh Hey if you uh learn this it's going

11148
03:06:03,830 --> 03:06:03,840
uh Hey if you uh learn this it's going
 

11149
03:06:03,840 --> 03:06:05,090
uh Hey if you uh learn this it's going
to be really painful the truth is

11150
03:06:05,090 --> 03:06:05,100
to be really painful the truth is
 

11151
03:06:05,100 --> 03:06:08,030
to be really painful the truth is
painful and if you're realizing this

11152
03:06:08,030 --> 03:06:08,040
painful and if you're realizing this
 

11153
03:06:08,040 --> 03:06:10,010
painful and if you're realizing this
thing about yourself it's gonna hurt and

11154
03:06:10,010 --> 03:06:10,020
thing about yourself it's gonna hurt and
 

11155
03:06:10,020 --> 03:06:11,090
thing about yourself it's gonna hurt and
this is a sign that you're heading in

11156
03:06:11,090 --> 03:06:11,100
this is a sign that you're heading in
 

11157
03:06:11,100 --> 03:06:13,070
this is a sign that you're heading in
the right direction so if you frame all

11158
03:06:13,070 --> 03:06:13,080
the right direction so if you frame all
 

11159
03:06:13,080 --> 03:06:15,469
the right direction so if you frame all
pain as a sign of of virtue then this

11160
03:06:15,469 --> 03:06:15,479
pain as a sign of of virtue then this
 

11161
03:06:15,479 --> 03:06:17,450
pain as a sign of of virtue then this
means that pain that's resulting as as

11162
03:06:17,450 --> 03:06:17,460
means that pain that's resulting as as
 

11163
03:06:17,460 --> 03:06:19,010
means that pain that's resulting as as
damage is something you're going to

11164
03:06:19,010 --> 03:06:19,020
damage is something you're going to
 

11165
03:06:19,020 --> 03:06:19,910
damage is something you're going to
ignore

11166
03:06:19,910 --> 03:06:19,920
ignore
 

11167
03:06:19,920 --> 03:06:21,950
ignore
so it's like this it's a common like

11168
03:06:21,950 --> 03:06:21,960
so it's like this it's a common like
 

11169
03:06:21,960 --> 03:06:24,110
so it's like this it's a common like
Cults right this is for your own good oh

11170
03:06:24,110 --> 03:06:24,120
Cults right this is for your own good oh
 

11171

Cults right this is for your own good oh
uh you know you've faced the brave truth

11172
03:06:26,750 --> 03:06:26,760
uh you know you've faced the brave truth
 

11173
03:06:26,760 --> 03:06:27,950
uh you know you've faced the brave truth
about yourself that you're like not

11174
03:06:27,950 --> 03:06:27,960
about yourself that you're like not
 

11175
03:06:27,960 --> 03:06:29,870
about yourself that you're like not
quite as wise as I am

11176
03:06:29,870 --> 03:06:29,880
quite as wise as I am
 

11177
03:06:29,880 --> 03:06:31,190
quite as wise as I am
um when really your brain might be

11178
03:06:31,190 --> 03:06:31,200
um when really your brain might be
 

11179
03:06:31,200 --> 03:06:32,570
um when really your brain might be
trying to tell you protective things or

11180
03:06:32,570 --> 03:06:32,580
trying to tell you protective things or
 

11181
03:06:32,580 --> 03:06:34,010
trying to tell you protective things or
like another one is like finger trap

11182
03:06:34,010 --> 03:06:34,020
like another one is like finger trap
 

11183
03:06:34,020 --> 03:06:35,030
like another one is like finger trap
beliefs

11184
03:06:35,030 --> 03:06:35,040
beliefs
 

11185
03:06:35,040 --> 03:06:36,590
beliefs
um where you the belief is constructed

11186
03:06:36,590 --> 03:06:36,600
um where you the belief is constructed
 

11187
03:06:36,600 --> 03:06:38,690
um where you the belief is constructed
in such a way that doubting it lends

11188
03:06:38,690 --> 03:06:38,700
in such a way that doubting it lends
 

11189
03:06:38,700 --> 03:06:41,210
in such a way that doubting it lends
proof to the belief it's a very common

11190
03:06:41,210 --> 03:06:41,220
proof to the belief it's a very common
 

11191
03:06:41,220 --> 03:06:43,550
proof to the belief it's a very common
example is like Satan like the

11192
03:06:43,550 --> 03:06:43,560
example is like Satan like the
 

11193
03:06:43,560 --> 03:06:45,290
example is like Satan like the
Christians are like uh you know Satan is

11194
03:06:45,290 --> 03:06:45,300
Christians are like uh you know Satan is
 

11195
03:06:45,300 --> 03:06:47,090
Christians are like uh you know Satan is
going to try to make you doubt him the

11196
03:06:47,090 --> 03:06:47,100
going to try to make you doubt him the
 

11197
03:06:47,100 --> 03:06:48,650
going to try to make you doubt him the
existence of he's going to so doubt like

11198
03:06:48,650 --> 03:06:48,660
existence of he's going to so doubt like
 

11199
03:06:48,660 --> 03:06:50,990
existence of he's going to so doubt like
maybe he's not actually real and so if

11200
03:06:50,990 --> 03:06:51,000
maybe he's not actually real and so if
 

11201
03:06:51,000 --> 03:06:52,130
maybe he's not actually real and so if
you believe in Satan and then you're

11202
03:06:52,130 --> 03:06:52,140
you believe in Satan and then you're
 

11203
03:06:52,140 --> 03:06:53,990
you believe in Satan and then you're
like okay now I'm having doubts like

11204
03:06:53,990 --> 03:06:54,000
like okay now I'm having doubts like
 

11205
03:06:54,000 --> 03:06:55,790
like okay now I'm having doubts like
maybe he isn't real this is like oh this

11206
03:06:55,790 --> 03:06:55,800
maybe he isn't real this is like oh this
 

11207
03:06:55,800 --> 03:06:57,050
maybe he isn't real this is like oh this
is exactly what I was taught to expect

11208
03:06:57,050 --> 03:06:57,060
is exactly what I was taught to expect
 

11209
03:06:57,060 --> 03:06:59,510
is exactly what I was taught to expect
like I am doubting this belief because I

11210
03:06:59,510 --> 03:06:59,520
like I am doubting this belief because I
 

11211
03:06:59,520 --> 03:07:01,670
like I am doubting this belief because I
was told because like this is what Satan

11212
03:07:01,670 --> 03:07:01,680
was told because like this is what Satan
 

11213
03:07:01,680 --> 03:07:03,349
was told because like this is what Satan
does and it's taken as evidence for it

11214
03:07:03,349 --> 03:07:03,359
does and it's taken as evidence for it
 

11215
03:07:03,359 --> 03:07:05,150
does and it's taken as evidence for it
so like the attempt to move away from

11216
03:07:05,150 --> 03:07:05,160
so like the attempt to move away from
 

11217
03:07:05,160 --> 03:07:08,030
so like the attempt to move away from
the belief like re like rebounds on you

11218
03:07:08,030 --> 03:07:08,040
the belief like re like rebounds on you
 

11219
03:07:08,040 --> 03:07:09,830
the belief like re like rebounds on you
and like causes you to be more embedded

11220
03:07:09,830 --> 03:07:09,840
and like causes you to be more embedded
 

11221
03:07:09,840 --> 03:07:11,990
and like causes you to be more embedded
inside of the belief yeah so it's like

11222
03:07:11,990 --> 03:07:12,000
inside of the belief yeah so it's like
 

11223
03:07:12,000 --> 03:07:13,610
inside of the belief yeah so it's like
techniques like these like very subtle

11224
03:07:13,610 --> 03:07:13,620
techniques like these like very subtle
 

11225
03:07:13,620 --> 03:07:15,530
techniques like these like very subtle
things where like being inside of this

11226
03:07:15,530 --> 03:07:15,540
things where like being inside of this
 

11227
03:07:15,540 --> 03:07:17,330
things where like being inside of this
system sort of just self-reinforces the

11228
03:07:17,330 --> 03:07:17,340
system sort of just self-reinforces the
 

11229
03:07:17,340 --> 03:07:19,190
system sort of just self-reinforces the
system is what I consider to be frame

11230
03:07:19,190 --> 03:07:19,200
system is what I consider to be frame
 

11231
03:07:19,200 --> 03:07:22,250
system is what I consider to be frame
control and have you met people that are

11232
03:07:22,250 --> 03:07:22,260
control and have you met people that are
 

11233
03:07:22,260 --> 03:07:23,870
control and have you met people that are
really good at this kind of frame

11234
03:07:23,870 --> 03:07:23,880
really good at this kind of frame
 

11235
03:07:23,880 --> 03:07:24,710
really good at this kind of frame
control

11236
03:07:24,710 --> 03:07:24,720
control
 

11237
03:07:24,720 --> 03:07:27,889
control
yeah yeah definitely so like you you're

11238
03:07:27,889 --> 03:07:27,899
yeah yeah definitely so like you you're
 

11239
03:07:27,899 --> 03:07:30,050
yeah yeah definitely so like you you're
saying that your father was like that

11240
03:07:30,050 --> 03:07:30,060
saying that your father was like that
 

11241
03:07:30,060 --> 03:07:31,670
saying that your father was like that
yeah to be fair I'm not sure he was good

11242
03:07:31,670 --> 03:07:31,680
yeah to be fair I'm not sure he was good
 

11243
03:07:31,680 --> 03:07:33,769
yeah to be fair I'm not sure he was good
at it because I was a kid right I think

11244
03:07:33,769 --> 03:07:33,779
at it because I was a kid right I think
 

11245
03:07:33,779 --> 03:07:35,510
at it because I was a kid right I think
he's probably not very good at it

11246
03:07:35,510 --> 03:07:35,520
he's probably not very good at it
 

11247
03:07:35,520 --> 03:07:37,429
he's probably not very good at it
actually but when you're a child being

11248
03:07:37,429 --> 03:07:37,439
actually but when you're a child being
 

11249
03:07:37,439 --> 03:07:38,690
actually but when you're a child being
raised in a house where he works from

11250
03:07:38,690 --> 03:07:38,700
raised in a house where he works from
 

11251
03:07:38,700 --> 03:07:41,210
raised in a house where he works from
home and you're homeschooled uh it's

11252
03:07:41,210 --> 03:07:41,220
home and you're homeschooled uh it's
 

11253
03:07:41,220 --> 03:07:42,950
home and you're homeschooled uh it's
just kind of what's going to happen and

11254
03:07:42,950 --> 03:07:42,960
just kind of what's going to happen and
 

11255
03:07:42,960 --> 03:07:44,450
just kind of what's going to happen and
to be fair I do think that like strong

11256
03:07:44,450 --> 03:07:44,460
to be fair I do think that like strong
 

11257
03:07:44,460 --> 03:07:46,309
to be fair I do think that like strong
frame control is quite rare I don't

11258
03:07:46,309 --> 03:07:46,319
frame control is quite rare I don't
 

11259
03:07:46,319 --> 03:07:47,630
frame control is quite rare I don't
think most people are kind of doing

11260
03:07:47,630 --> 03:07:47,640
think most people are kind of doing
 

11261
03:07:47,640 --> 03:07:49,370
think most people are kind of doing
something like this but not nearly to

11262
03:07:49,370 --> 03:07:49,380
something like this but not nearly to
 

11263
03:07:49,380 --> 03:07:50,929
something like this but not nearly to
the degree that makes gives me the ick

11264
03:07:50,929 --> 03:07:50,939
the degree that makes gives me the ick
 

11265
03:07:50,939 --> 03:07:53,330
the degree that makes gives me the ick
yeah uh I've met maybe like five or six

11266
03:07:53,330 --> 03:07:53,340
yeah uh I've met maybe like five or six
 

11267
03:07:53,340 --> 03:07:55,370
yeah uh I've met maybe like five or six
people I think who I really don't like

11268
03:07:55,370 --> 03:07:55,380
people I think who I really don't like
 

11269
03:07:55,380 --> 03:07:57,410
people I think who I really don't like
because of those very subtle things that

11270
03:07:57,410 --> 03:07:57,420
because of those very subtle things that
 

11271
03:07:57,420 --> 03:07:59,809
because of those very subtle things that
they're doing I think also I'm starting

11272
03:07:59,809 --> 03:07:59,819
they're doing I think also I'm starting
 

11273
03:07:59,819 --> 03:08:02,330
they're doing I think also I'm starting
to kind of understand that there is

11274
03:08:02,330 --> 03:08:02,340
to kind of understand that there is
 

11275
03:08:02,340 --> 03:08:03,969
to kind of understand that there is
people who are

11276
03:08:03,969 --> 03:08:03,979
people who are
 

11277
03:08:03,979 --> 03:08:05,929
people who are
narcissists and sociopaths and

11278
03:08:05,929 --> 03:08:05,939
narcissists and sociopaths and
 

11279
03:08:05,939 --> 03:08:07,550
narcissists and sociopaths and
Psychopaths out there

11280
03:08:07,550 --> 03:08:07,560
Psychopaths out there
 

11281
03:08:07,560 --> 03:08:09,889
Psychopaths out there
and um

11282
03:08:09,889 --> 03:08:09,899
and um
 

11283
03:08:09,899 --> 03:08:11,870
and um
I'm not even sure if people like that

11284
03:08:11,870 --> 03:08:11,880
I'm not even sure if people like that
 

11285
03:08:11,880 --> 03:08:13,910
I'm not even sure if people like that
because I think they get good at frame

11286
03:08:13,910 --> 03:08:13,920
because I think they get good at frame
 

11287
03:08:13,920 --> 03:08:15,469
because I think they get good at frame
control

11288
03:08:15,469 --> 03:08:15,479
control
 

11289
03:08:15,479 --> 03:08:16,790
control
but I don't know if they're aware

11290
03:08:16,790 --> 03:08:16,800
but I don't know if they're aware
 

11291
03:08:16,800 --> 03:08:19,550
but I don't know if they're aware
they're doing it oh yeah which makes me

11292
03:08:19,550 --> 03:08:19,560
they're doing it oh yeah which makes me
 

11293
03:08:19,560 --> 03:08:21,889
they're doing it oh yeah which makes me
also nervous about myself like am I

11294
03:08:21,889 --> 03:08:21,899
also nervous about myself like am I
 

11295
03:08:21,899 --> 03:08:24,050
also nervous about myself like am I
doing frame control

11296
03:08:24,050 --> 03:08:24,060
doing frame control
 

11297
03:08:24,060 --> 03:08:25,490
doing frame control
yeah that's one of the big things it's

11298
03:08:25,490 --> 03:08:25,500
yeah that's one of the big things it's
 

11299
03:08:25,500 --> 03:08:28,010
yeah that's one of the big things it's
like like typically people you can't

11300
03:08:28,010 --> 03:08:28,020
like like typically people you can't
 

11301
03:08:28,020 --> 03:08:30,050
like like typically people you can't
think about incentive like you can't

11302
03:08:30,050 --> 03:08:30,060
think about incentive like you can't
 

11303
03:08:30,060 --> 03:08:31,370
think about incentive like you can't
think about oh is this person trying to

11304
03:08:31,370 --> 03:08:31,380
think about oh is this person trying to
 

11305
03:08:31,380 --> 03:08:33,170
think about oh is this person trying to
do it or not yeah it's like not the

11306
03:08:33,170 --> 03:08:33,180
do it or not yeah it's like not the
 

11307
03:08:33,180 --> 03:08:34,490
do it or not yeah it's like not the
quite not the way you have to look at

11308
03:08:34,490 --> 03:08:34,500
quite not the way you have to look at
 

11309
03:08:34,500 --> 03:08:35,809
quite not the way you have to look at
what are the effects programmatically

11310
03:08:35,809 --> 03:08:35,819
what are the effects programmatically
 

11311
03:08:35,819 --> 03:08:37,610
what are the effects programmatically
looking at the effects and then you also

11312
03:08:37,610 --> 03:08:37,620
looking at the effects and then you also
 

11313
03:08:37,620 --> 03:08:39,969
looking at the effects and then you also
have to do that with yourself

11314
03:08:39,969 --> 03:08:39,979
have to do that with yourself
 

11315
03:08:39,979 --> 03:08:42,230
have to do that with yourself
it's like very much like are you like

11316

it's like very much like are you like
 

11317
03:08:42,240 --> 03:08:44,210
it's like very much like are you like
how much space are you making for the

11318
03:08:44,210 --> 03:08:44,220
how much space are you making for the
 

11319
03:08:44,220 --> 03:08:46,670
how much space are you making for the
other person's reality here like sure

11320
03:08:46,670 --> 03:08:46,680
other person's reality here like sure
 

11321
03:08:46,680 --> 03:08:48,590
other person's reality here like sure
are you are you giving power to the

11322
03:08:48,590 --> 03:08:48,600
are you are you giving power to the
 

11323
03:08:48,600 --> 03:08:50,389
are you are you giving power to the
other person because a big aspect of

11324
03:08:50,389 --> 03:08:50,399
other person because a big aspect of
 

11325
03:08:50,399 --> 03:08:51,469
other person because a big aspect of
frame controls you're carefully

11326
03:08:51,469 --> 03:08:51,479
frame controls you're carefully
 

11327
03:08:51,479 --> 03:08:53,389
frame controls you're carefully
rerouting the power to yourself

11328
03:08:53,389 --> 03:08:53,399
rerouting the power to yourself
 

11329
03:08:53,399 --> 03:08:55,610
rerouting the power to yourself
you're like I am the person who knows

11330
03:08:55,610 --> 03:08:55,620
you're like I am the person who knows
 

11331
03:08:55,620 --> 03:08:57,469
you're like I am the person who knows
I'm like you're having pain in your

11332
03:08:57,469 --> 03:08:57,479
I'm like you're having pain in your
 

11333
03:08:57,479 --> 03:08:58,790
I'm like you're having pain in your
beliefs because you're updating towards

11334
03:08:58,790 --> 03:08:58,800
beliefs because you're updating towards
 

11335
03:08:58,800 --> 03:09:01,010
beliefs because you're updating towards
the things that I believe like it's it's

11336
03:09:01,010 --> 03:09:01,020
the things that I believe like it's it's
 

11337
03:09:01,020 --> 03:09:02,929
the things that I believe like it's it's
just like a gravity well but if you're

11338
03:09:02,929 --> 03:09:02,939
just like a gravity well but if you're
 

11339
03:09:02,939 --> 03:09:04,370
just like a gravity well but if you're
if you're setting up the gravity well of

11340
03:09:04,370 --> 03:09:04,380
if you're setting up the gravity well of
 

11341
03:09:04,380 --> 03:09:05,630
if you're setting up the gravity well of
your interaction such that you're making

11342
03:09:05,630 --> 03:09:05,640
your interaction such that you're making
 

11343
03:09:05,640 --> 03:09:06,830
your interaction such that you're making
sure you're giving the other person

11344
03:09:06,830 --> 03:09:06,840
sure you're giving the other person
 

11345
03:09:06,840 --> 03:09:08,690
sure you're giving the other person
power over the shared reality you

11346
03:09:08,690 --> 03:09:08,700
power over the shared reality you
 

11347
03:09:08,700 --> 03:09:10,070
power over the shared reality you
inhabit I think it's a really good sign

11348
03:09:10,070 --> 03:09:10,080
inhabit I think it's a really good sign
 

11349
03:09:10,080 --> 03:09:12,290
inhabit I think it's a really good sign
that you're not doing problem control

11350
03:09:12,290 --> 03:09:12,300
that you're not doing problem control
 

11351
03:09:12,300 --> 03:09:14,450
that you're not doing problem control
so if you're making room for them yeah

11352
03:09:14,450 --> 03:09:14,460
so if you're making room for them yeah
 

11353
03:09:14,460 --> 03:09:16,969
so if you're making room for them yeah
okay unless we're talking about embed

11354
03:09:16,969 --> 03:09:16,979
okay unless we're talking about embed
 

11355
03:09:16,979 --> 03:09:19,610
okay unless we're talking about embed
then it then then it's all general

11356
03:09:19,610 --> 03:09:19,620
then it then then it's all general
 

11357

then it then then it's all general
relativity from there and black holes

um it took me a long time to get a bed

11364
03:09:27,530 --> 03:09:27,540
um it took me a long time to get a bed
 

11365
03:09:27,540 --> 03:09:30,170
um it took me a long time to get a bed
frame just I'm saying I know but you

11366
03:09:30,170 --> 03:09:30,180

11369
03:09:32,600 --> 03:09:35,809
wear a suit though
uh yeah uh so frame control on the

11370
03:09:35,809 --> 03:09:35,819
uh yeah uh so frame control on the
 

11371
03:09:35,819 --> 03:09:38,030
uh yeah uh so frame control on the
streets no frame in the sheets I don't

11372
03:09:38,030 --> 03:09:38,040
streets no frame in the sheets I don't
 

11373
03:09:38,040 --> 03:09:39,469
streets no frame in the sheets I don't
know I don't know what the funny thing

11374
03:09:39,469 --> 03:09:39,479
know I don't know what the funny thing
 

11375
03:09:39,479 --> 03:09:42,410
know I don't know what the funny thing
is to say though but there you have it

11376
03:09:42,410 --> 03:09:42,420
is to say though but there you have it
 

11377
03:09:42,420 --> 03:09:45,530
is to say though but there you have it
um so the LSD helped you escape the the

11378
03:09:45,530 --> 03:09:45,540
um so the LSD helped you escape the the
 

11379
03:09:45,540 --> 03:09:46,870
um so the LSD helped you escape the the
frame

11380
03:09:46,870 --> 03:09:46,880
frame
 

11381
03:09:46,880 --> 03:09:48,830
frame
of uh

11382
03:09:48,830 --> 03:09:48,840
of uh
 

11383
03:09:48,840 --> 03:09:50,809
of uh
can you like elaborate what what was the

11384
03:09:50,809 --> 03:09:50,819
can you like elaborate what what was the
 

11385
03:09:50,819 --> 03:09:53,570
can you like elaborate what what was the
frame that was

11386
03:09:53,570 --> 03:09:53,580
frame that was
 

11387
03:09:53,580 --> 03:09:55,969
frame that was
holding you back

11388
03:09:55,969 --> 03:09:55,979
holding you back
 

11389
03:09:55,979 --> 03:09:57,830

you back as an intellectual as a thinker
as a free being in this world

this Frame that I had been deeply

11428
03:10:34,250 --> 03:10:34,260
this Frame that I had been deeply
 

11429
03:10:34,260 --> 03:10:36,290
this Frame that I had been deeply
wronged like there was a correct way of

being and the world had violated that
 

11433
03:10:38,580 --> 03:10:40,670
being and the world had violated that
something should not have happened like

11434
03:10:40,670 --> 03:10:40,680
something should not have happened like
 

11435
03:10:40,680 --> 03:10:42,889
something should not have happened like
my father should have left me and it was

like this this like like the shearing in

11438
03:10:46,250 --> 03:10:46,260
like this this like like the shearing in
 

11439
03:10:46,260 --> 03:10:47,630
like this this like like the shearing in
the nature of reality and that was

11440
03:10:47,630 --> 03:10:47,640
the nature of reality and that was
 

11441
03:10:47,640 --> 03:10:51,590
the nature of reality and that was
really agonizing to have and LSD really

11442
03:10:51,590 --> 03:10:51,600
really agonizing to have and LSD really
 

11443
03:10:51,600 --> 03:10:53,690
really agonizing to have and LSD really
messes with frames a lot it takes like

11444
03:10:53,690 --> 03:10:53,700
messes with frames a lot it takes like
 

11445
03:10:53,700 --> 03:10:54,830
messes with frames a lot it takes like
what you think is normal and really

11446
03:10:54,830 --> 03:10:54,840
what you think is normal and really
 

11447
03:10:54,840 --> 03:10:56,809
what you think is normal and really
screws with it and I didn't LLC like

11448
03:10:56,809 --> 03:10:56,819
screws with it and I didn't LLC like
 

11449
03:10:56,819 --> 03:10:58,550
screws with it and I didn't LLC like
several times before but there's one LSD

11450
03:10:58,550 --> 03:10:58,560
several times before but there's one LSD
 

11451
03:10:58,560 --> 03:11:01,309
several times before but there's one LSD
trip where I remember I went through my

11452
03:11:01,309 --> 03:11:01,319
trip where I remember I went through my
 

11453
03:11:01,319 --> 03:11:02,809
trip where I remember I went through my
entire childhood in my head because LC

11454
03:11:02,809 --> 03:11:02,819
entire childhood in my head because LC
 

11455
03:11:02,819 --> 03:11:04,849
entire childhood in my head because LC
like really makes your memories quite

11456
03:11:04,849 --> 03:11:04,859
like really makes your memories quite
 

11457
03:11:04,859 --> 03:11:06,590
like really makes your memories quite
Vivid like anything you visualize it's

11458
03:11:06,590 --> 03:11:06,600
Vivid like anything you visualize it's
 

11459
03:11:06,600 --> 03:11:08,690
Vivid like anything you visualize it's
like you're in it and so I just went and

11460
03:11:08,690 --> 03:11:08,700
like you're in it and so I just went and
 

11461
03:11:08,700 --> 03:11:10,370
like you're in it and so I just went and
very carefully deliberately went and

03:11:10,370 --> 03:11:10,380
very carefully deliberately went and
 

11463
03:11:10,380 --> 03:11:11,990
very carefully deliberately went and
remembered every single memory that I

11464
03:11:11,990 --> 03:11:12,000

anymore I'm like kind of I'm over it
 

11619
03:13:45,899 --> 03:13:48,469
anymore I'm like kind of I'm over it
like I've let go he's his own person

11620
03:13:48,469 --> 03:13:48,479
like I've let go he's his own person
 

11621
03:13:48,479 --> 03:13:50,750
like I've let go he's his own person
like ultimately he didn't get to decide

11622
03:13:50,750 --> 03:13:50,760
like ultimately he didn't get to decide
 

11623
03:13:50,760 --> 03:13:52,070
like ultimately he didn't get to decide
who he was in the same way that I didn't

11624
03:13:52,070 --> 03:13:52,080
who he was in the same way that I didn't

03:24:15,180 --> 03:24:16,729
who say oh I like to be at parties they
also tend to say yes to the questions

12228
03:24:16,729 --> 03:24:16,739
also tend to say yes to the questions
 

12229
03:24:16,739 --> 03:24:18,410
also tend to say yes to the questions
like I like being the center of

12230
03:24:18,410 --> 03:24:18,420
like I like being the center of
 

12231
03:24:18,420 --> 03:24:19,969
like I like being the center of
attention and so you notice that like

12232
03:24:19,969 --> 03:24:19,979
attention and so you notice that like
 

12233
03:24:19,979 --> 03:24:21,110
attention and so you notice that like
there's a cluster of ways people are

12234
03:24:21,110 --> 03:24:21,120
there's a cluster of ways people are
 

12235
03:24:21,120 --> 03:24:22,309
there's a cluster of ways people are
answering the question and then you can

12236
03:24:22,309 --> 03:24:22,319
answering the question and then you can
 

12237
03:24:22,319 --> 03:24:25,429
answering the question and then you can
sort of pull out an organic spectrum and

12238
03:24:25,429 --> 03:24:25,439
sort of pull out an organic spectrum and
 

12239
03:24:25,439 --> 03:24:27,110
sort of pull out an organic spectrum and
so I was like okay we've done that a

12240
03:24:27,110 --> 03:24:27,120
so I was like okay we've done that a
 

12241
03:24:27,120 --> 03:24:29,030
so I was like okay we've done that a
whole bunch with things like personality

12242
03:24:29,030 --> 03:24:29,040
whole bunch with things like personality

what happens if you apply that method to
 

12249
03:24:35,460 --> 03:24:37,010
what happens if you apply that method to
a completely unselected group of

12250
03:24:37,010 --> 03:24:37,020
a completely unselected group of
 

12251
03:24:37,020 --> 03:24:41,030
a completely unselected group of
questions just like no random chaotic no

12252
03:24:41,030 --> 03:24:41,040
questions just like no random chaotic no
 

12253
03:24:41,040 --> 03:24:42,710
questions just like no random chaotic no
thing whatsoever like what happens is if

12254
03:24:42,710 --> 03:24:42,720
thing whatsoever like what happens is if
 

12255

natural things evolve out of that
 

12259
03:24:46,080 --> 03:24:48,229
natural things evolve out of that
natural spectrums so I had other people

12260

and you don't know most of those
 

12555
03:30:22,020 --> 03:30:24,530
and you don't know most of those
experiences and all sudden you meet this

12556

experiences and all sudden you meet this
 

12557
03:30:24,540 --> 03:30:26,450

and like what are you supposed to do
 

12561
03:30:27,779 --> 03:30:30,950
and like what are you supposed to do
with both of your like training data

12562
03:30:30,950 --> 03:30:30,960
with both of your like training data
 

12563
03:30:30,960 --> 03:30:34,070
with both of your like training data
are you supposed to like like what

12564
03:30:34,070 --> 03:30:34,080
are you supposed to like like what
 

12565
03:30:34,080 --> 03:30:36,469

wants to not actually ever talk about it

12568

wants to not actually ever talk about it
 

12569
03:30:39,840 --> 03:30:41,929
wants to not actually ever talk about it
to care at all like why does it matter

12570
03:30:41,929 --> 03:30:41,939
to care at all like why does it matter
 

12571
03:30:41,939 --> 03:30:43,429
to care at all like why does it matter
because only like the future is that

12572
03:30:43,429 --> 03:30:43,439
because only like the future is that
 

12573
03:30:43,439 --> 03:30:46,309
because only like the future is that
matters and yet the past also matters a

12574
03:30:46,309 --> 03:30:46,319
matters and yet the past also matters a
 

12575
03:30:46,319 --> 03:30:48,410
matters and yet the past also matters a
lot potentially but maybe not really

12576
03:30:48,410 --> 03:30:48,420
lot potentially but maybe not really
 

12577
03:30:48,420 --> 03:30:50,450
lot potentially but maybe not really
because you're you're you're somehow

03:30:50,450 --> 03:30:50,460
because you're you're you're somehow

like
 

12581
03:30:51,319 --> 03:30:54,950
like
constructed from that past but you're no

12582
03:30:54,950 --> 03:30:54,960
constructed from that past but you're no
 

12583
03:30:54,960 --> 03:30:56,510
constructed from that past but you're no
longer that past

12584
03:30:56,510 --> 03:30:56,520
longer that past
 

12585
03:30:56,520 --> 03:30:57,830
longer that past
like you're evaluating for something

12586

like it's very practically oriented

12618
03:31:28,429 --> 03:31:28,439
like it's very practically oriented
 

12619
03:31:28,439 --> 03:31:30,410
like it's very practically oriented
whereas like if the thing that you're

12620
03:31:30,410 --> 03:31:30,420
whereas like if the thing that you're
 

12621
03:31:30,420 --> 03:31:33,229
whereas like if the thing that you're
focused on is not like being able to

12622
03:31:33,229 --> 03:31:33,239
focused on is not like being able to
 

12623
03:31:33,239 --> 03:31:34,429
focused on is not like being able to
predict someone

12624
03:31:34,429 --> 03:31:34,439
predict someone
 

12625
03:31:34,439 --> 03:31:35,929
predict someone
like if the thing that you focus on is

12626
03:31:35,929 --> 03:31:35,939
like if the thing that you focus on is
 

12627
03:31:35,939 --> 03:31:37,070
like if the thing that you focus on is
the present moment then it doesn't

12628
03:31:37,070 --> 03:31:37,080
the present moment then it doesn't
 

12629
03:31:37,080 --> 03:31:39,290
the present moment then it doesn't
really matter anymore they're

12630
03:31:39,290 --> 03:31:39,300
really matter anymore they're
 

12631
03:31:39,300 --> 03:31:41,210
really matter anymore they're
they're the things that like their

12632
03:31:41,210 --> 03:31:41,220
they're the things that like their
 

12633
03:31:41,220 --> 03:31:43,250
they're the things that like their
training data but I also I also think

12634
03:31:43,250 --> 03:31:43,260
training data but I also I also think
 

12635
03:31:43,260 --> 03:31:44,809
training data but I also I also think
that the past is not that predictive of

12636
03:31:44,809 --> 03:31:44,819
that the past is not that predictive of
 

12637
03:31:44,819 --> 03:31:47,750
that the past is not that predictive of
the future is it not not if you believe

12638
03:31:47,750 --> 03:31:47,760
the future is it not not if you believe
 

12639
03:31:47,760 --> 03:31:49,250
the future is it not not if you believe
in the power of the interaction between

12640
03:31:49,250 --> 03:31:49,260
in the power of the interaction between
 

12641
03:31:49,260 --> 03:31:51,769
in the power of the interaction between
two humans second nature versus nurture

12642
03:31:51,769 --> 03:31:51,779
two humans second nature versus nurture
 

12643
03:31:51,779 --> 03:31:54,830
two humans second nature versus nurture
I guess also I don't believe in the in

12644
03:31:54,830 --> 03:31:54,840
I guess also I don't believe in the in
 

12645
03:31:54,840 --> 03:31:56,870
I guess also I don't believe in the in
the if in the ability of people to

12646
03:31:56,870 --> 03:31:56,880
the if in the ability of people to
 

12647
03:31:56,880 --> 03:31:59,269
the if in the ability of people to
accurately describe their own past this

12648
03:31:59,269 --> 03:31:59,279
accurately describe their own past this
 

12649
03:31:59,279 --> 03:32:00,349
accurately describe their own past this
is true because they have a very

12650
03:32:00,349 --> 03:32:00,359
is true because they have a very
 

12651
03:32:00,359 --> 03:32:01,969
is true because they have a very
specific lens through it that doesn't

12652
03:32:01,969 --> 03:32:01,979
specific lens through it that doesn't
 

12653
03:32:01,979 --> 03:32:04,309
specific lens through it that doesn't
necessarily like it's too biased

12654
03:32:04,309 --> 03:32:04,319
necessarily like it's too biased
 

12655
03:32:04,319 --> 03:32:06,110
necessarily like it's too biased
can also interpret based on the bias

12656
03:32:06,110 --> 03:32:06,120
can also interpret based on the bias
 

12657
03:32:06,120 --> 03:32:07,190
can also interpret based on the bias
like if somebody describes their own

12658
03:32:07,190 --> 03:32:07,200
like if somebody describes their own
 

12659
03:32:07,200 --> 03:32:09,170
like if somebody describes their own
past you can kind of pick up like hard

12660
03:32:09,170 --> 03:32:09,180
past you can kind of pick up like hard
 

12661
03:32:09,180 --> 03:32:10,969
past you can kind of pick up like hard
it's difficult like you would you could

12662
03:32:10,969 --> 03:32:10,979
it's difficult like you would you could
 

12663
03:32:10,979 --> 03:32:12,290
it's difficult like you would you could
if you're a therapist like if you're

12664
03:32:12,290 --> 03:32:12,300
if you're a therapist like if you're
 

12665
03:32:12,300 --> 03:32:15,170
if you're a therapist like if you're
really drilling like or whatever sorry

12666
03:32:15,170 --> 03:32:15,180
really drilling like or whatever sorry
 

12667
03:32:15,180 --> 03:32:17,710
really drilling like or whatever sorry
if you're really investigating and like

12668
03:32:17,710 --> 03:32:17,720
if you're really investigating and like
 

12669
03:32:17,720 --> 03:32:20,330
if you're really investigating and like
analyzing it but then it's like it's a

12670
03:32:20,330 --> 03:32:20,340
analyzing it but then it's like it's a
 

12671
03:32:20,340 --> 03:32:21,710
analyzing it but then it's like it's a
different kind of relationship right

12672
03:32:21,710 --> 03:32:21,720
different kind of relationship right
 

12673
03:32:21,720 --> 03:32:23,630
different kind of relationship right
isn't that hard though like if I'm with

12674
03:32:23,630 --> 03:32:23,640
isn't that hard though like if I'm with
 

12675
03:32:23,640 --> 03:32:25,070
isn't that hard though like if I'm with
the guide I'm considering dating him and

12676
03:32:25,070 --> 03:32:25,080
the guide I'm considering dating him and
 

12677
03:32:25,080 --> 03:32:26,030
the guide I'm considering dating him and
I asked like how did your past

12678
03:32:26,030 --> 03:32:26,040
I asked like how did your past
 

12679
03:32:26,040 --> 03:32:27,710
I asked like how did your past
relationships end and then if all of

12680
03:32:27,710 --> 03:32:27,720

I don't know how to evaluate this thing

12886
03:36:22,130 --> 03:36:22,140
I don't know how to evaluate this thing
 

12887
03:36:22,140 --> 03:36:23,330
I don't know how to evaluate this thing
right because this is like one of those

12888
03:36:23,330 --> 03:36:23,340
right because this is like one of those
 

12889
03:36:23,340 --> 03:36:25,190
right because this is like one of those
really charged things where like I kind

12890
03:36:25,190 --> 03:36:25,200
really charged things where like I kind
 

12891
03:36:25,200 --> 03:36:26,750
really charged things where like I kind
of don't trust anybody's arguments on it

12892
03:36:26,750 --> 03:36:26,760
of don't trust anybody's arguments on it
 

12893
03:36:26,760 --> 03:36:28,309
of don't trust anybody's arguments on it
because it's too charged

12894
03:36:28,309 --> 03:36:28,319
because it's too charged
 

12895
03:36:28,319 --> 03:36:29,990
because it's too charged
um but like there's another question

12896
03:36:29,990 --> 03:36:30,000
um but like there's another question
 

12897
03:36:30,000 --> 03:36:31,729
um but like there's another question
which is like is it a net positive or

12898
03:36:31,729 --> 03:36:31,739
which is like is it a net positive or
 

12899
03:36:31,739 --> 03:36:33,830
which is like is it a net positive or
net negative yeah like it's possible

12900
03:36:33,830 --> 03:36:33,840
net negative yeah like it's possible
 

12901
03:36:33,840 --> 03:36:35,389
net negative yeah like it's possible
that it might be like a net negative

12902
03:36:35,389 --> 03:36:35,399
that it might be like a net negative
 

12903
03:36:35,399 --> 03:36:37,070
that it might be like a net negative
four specifically our relationship to

12904
03:36:37,070 --> 03:36:37,080
four specifically our relationship to
 

12905
03:36:37,080 --> 03:36:39,170
four specifically our relationship to
sex but like a net positive overall in

12906
03:36:39,170 --> 03:36:39,180
sex but like a net positive overall in
 

12907
03:36:39,180 --> 03:36:39,889
sex but like a net positive overall in
general

12908
03:36:39,889 --> 03:36:39,899
general
 

12909
03:36:39,899 --> 03:36:42,889
general
I'm not sure but the thing my guess is

12910
03:36:42,889 --> 03:36:42,899
I'm not sure but the thing my guess is
 

12911
03:36:42,899 --> 03:36:44,570
I'm not sure but the thing my guess is
that in general it's better to let

12912
03:36:44,570 --> 03:36:44,580
that in general it's better to let
 

12913
03:36:44,580 --> 03:36:46,250
that in general it's better to let
people do the thing that feels good to

12914
03:36:46,250 --> 03:36:46,260
people do the thing that feels good to
 

12915
03:36:46,260 --> 03:36:48,170
people do the thing that feels good to
them and then the environment will

12916
03:36:48,170 --> 03:36:48,180
them and then the environment will
 

12917
03:36:48,180 --> 03:36:50,990
them and then the environment will
naturally modify to fit this thing and

12918
03:36:50,990 --> 03:36:51,000
naturally modify to fit this thing and
 

12919
03:36:51,000 --> 03:36:52,550
naturally modify to fit this thing and
then if we have more needs in response

12920
03:36:52,550 --> 03:36:52,560
then if we have more needs in response
 

12921
03:36:52,560 --> 03:36:53,750
then if we have more needs in response
to that then we're going to figure out a

12922
03:36:53,750 --> 03:36:53,760
to that then we're going to figure out a
 

12923
03:36:53,760 --> 03:36:55,790
to that then we're going to figure out a
way to take care of those needs so if

12924
03:36:55,790 --> 03:36:55,800
way to take care of those needs so if
 

12925
03:36:55,800 --> 03:36:57,050
way to take care of those needs so if

with women then we're gonna have to like
 

12931
03:36:59,580 --> 03:37:01,490
with women then we're gonna have to like
change the way that we like experience

12932
03:37:01,490 --> 03:37:01,500
change the way that we like experience
 

12933
03:37:01,500 --> 03:37:03,530
change the way that we like experience

of trying to stop at things that people
 

12945
03:37:13,080 --> 03:37:14,389
of trying to stop at things that people
wanted to actually figure out how to

03:37:14,389 --> 03:37:14,399
wanted to actually figure out how to
 

12947
03:37:14,399 --> 03:37:16,010
wanted to actually figure out how to
integrate that and like find a more

12948
03:37:16,010 --> 03:37:16,020
integrate that and like find a more
 

12949
03:37:16,020 --> 03:37:17,690
integrate that and like find a more
healthy outlet but you have to then be

12950
03:37:17,690 --> 03:37:17,700
healthy outlet but you have to then be
 

12951
03:37:17,700 --> 03:37:20,750
healthy outlet but you have to then be
first honest with the effects that porn

12952

like how important is sex for society I
 

12987
03:37:57,660 --> 03:37:59,809
like how important is sex for society I
guess with between two humans yeah I

12988
03:37:59,809 --> 03:37:59,819
guess with between two humans yeah I
 

12989
03:37:59,819 --> 03:38:01,190
guess with between two humans yeah I
mean like we're having less sex than

12990
03:38:01,190 --> 03:38:01,200
mean like we're having less sex than
 

12991
03:38:01,200 --> 03:38:03,769
mean like we're having less sex than
making fewer babies and that seems like

12992
03:38:03,769 --> 03:38:03,779
making fewer babies and that seems like
 

12993
03:38:03,779 --> 03:38:05,150
making fewer babies and that seems like
probably not great

12994
03:38:05,150 --> 03:38:05,160
probably not great
 

12995
03:38:05,160 --> 03:38:07,910
probably not great
uh yeah right with the babies one

12996
03:38:07,910 --> 03:38:07,920
uh yeah right with the babies one
 

12997
03:38:07,920 --> 03:38:09,830
uh yeah right with the babies one
yeah but the babies there's probably

12998
03:38:09,830 --> 03:38:09,840
yeah but the babies there's probably
 

12999
03:38:09,840 --> 03:38:11,510
yeah but the babies there's probably
artificial ways to have babies that we

13000
03:38:11,510 --> 03:38:11,520
artificial ways to have babies that we
 

13001
03:38:11,520 --> 03:38:14,210
artificial ways to have babies that we
can figure out yeah but then how

13002
03:38:14,210 --> 03:38:14,220
can figure out yeah but then how
 

13003
03:38:14,220 --> 03:38:16,309

13007
03:38:18,600 --> 03:38:20,510
with other humans like we're gonna have
to figure that out in the century

13008
03:38:20,510 --> 03:38:20,520
to figure that out in the century
 

13009
03:38:20,520 --> 03:38:22,130
to figure that out in the century

don't know torture for a million years
 

13127
03:40:22,260 --> 03:40:25,790

but like maybe if they reset your memory

13130
03:40:27,530 --> 03:40:27,540
but like maybe if they reset your memory
 

13131
03:40:27,540 --> 03:40:28,910
but like maybe if they reset your memory
so it was not a loop so you're always

13132
03:40:28,910 --> 03:40:28,920
so it was not a loop so you're always
 

13133
03:40:28,920 --> 03:40:30,229
so it was not a loop so you're always
experiencing torture for the first time

13134
03:40:30,229 --> 03:40:30,239
experiencing torture for the first time
 

13135
03:40:30,239 --> 03:40:32,450
experiencing torture for the first time
yeah hence torture torch is supposed to

13136
03:40:32,450 --> 03:40:32,460
yeah hence torture torch is supposed to
 

13137
03:40:32,460 --> 03:40:33,950
yeah hence torture torch is supposed to
be unpleasant I'm sure AI will be very

13138
03:40:33,950 --> 03:40:33,960
be unpleasant I'm sure AI will be very
 

13139
03:40:33,960 --> 03:40:35,570
be unpleasant I'm sure AI will be very
creative in figuring out how to torture

13140
03:40:35,570 --> 03:40:35,580
creative in figuring out how to torture
 

13141
03:40:35,580 --> 03:40:36,530
creative in figuring out how to torture
you

13142
03:40:36,530 --> 03:40:36,540
you
 

13143
03:40:36,540 --> 03:40:38,570
you
I think I would be I would go on the

13144
03:40:38,570 --> 03:40:38,580
I think I would be I would go on the
 

13145
03:40:38,580 --> 03:40:40,490
I think I would be I would go on the
safe side I was just like

13146
03:40:40,490 --> 03:40:40,500
safe side I was just like
 

13147
03:40:40,500 --> 03:40:43,849
safe side I was just like
like 150 years but really 150 though

13148
03:40:43,849 --> 03:40:43,859
like 150 years but really 150 though
 

13149
03:40:43,859 --> 03:40:45,290
like 150 years but really 150 though
that feels like right in like The

13150
03:40:45,290 --> 03:40:45,300
that feels like right in like The
 

13151
03:40:45,300 --> 03:40:47,450
that feels like right in like The
Uncanny Valley well you picked 120 for

13152
03:40:47,450 --> 03:40:47,460
Uncanny Valley well you picked 120 for
 

13153
03:40:47,460 --> 03:40:54,410
Uncanny Valley well you picked 120 for
body count so I'm picking 150.

13154
03:40:54,410 --> 03:40:54,420

 

13155
03:40:54,420 --> 03:40:56,870

of The Uncanny Valley

13156
03:40:56,870 --> 03:40:56,880
of The Uncanny Valley
 

13157
03:40:56,880 --> 03:40:58,790
of The Uncanny Valley
it's like probably everybody that you

13158
03:40:58,790 --> 03:40:58,800
it's like probably everybody that you
 

13159
03:40:58,800 --> 03:41:00,229
it's like probably everybody that you
grew up with is going to be dead it's

13160
03:41:00,229 --> 03:41:00,239
grew up with is going to be dead it's
 

13161
03:41:00,239 --> 03:41:01,550
grew up with is going to be dead it's
like just enough for like everybody you

13162
03:41:01,550 --> 03:41:01,560
like just enough for like everybody you
 

13163
03:41:01,560 --> 03:41:04,250
like just enough for like everybody you
know to die like one cycle

13164
03:41:04,250 --> 03:41:04,260
know to die like one cycle
 

13165
03:41:04,260 --> 03:41:06,590
know to die like one cycle
yeah and then start dating the Next

13166
03:41:06,590 --> 03:41:06,600
yeah and then start dating the Next
 

13167
03:41:06,600 --> 03:41:08,269
yeah and then start dating the Next
Generation no I don't know and then so

13168
03:41:08,269 --> 03:41:08,279
Generation no I don't know and then so
 

13169
03:41:08,279 --> 03:41:10,210
Generation no I don't know and then so
you get like sort of two lifetimes yeah

13170
03:41:10,210 --> 03:41:10,220
you get like sort of two lifetimes yeah
 

13171
03:41:10,220 --> 03:41:11,830
you get like sort of two lifetimes yeah
yeah

13172
03:41:11,830 --> 03:41:11,840
yeah
 

13173
03:41:11,840 --> 03:41:14,510
yeah
I mean it also really depends on if

13174
03:41:14,510 --> 03:41:14,520
I mean it also really depends on if
 

13175
03:41:14,520 --> 03:41:16,729
I mean it also really depends on if
other people get this feature

13176
03:41:16,729 --> 03:41:16,739
other people get this feature
 

13177
03:41:16,739 --> 03:41:18,590
other people get this feature
yeah I assume they don't

13178
03:41:18,590 --> 03:41:18,600
yeah I assume they don't
 

13179
03:41:18,600 --> 03:41:20,330
yeah I assume they don't
because you'll have like

13180
03:41:20,330 --> 03:41:20,340
because you'll have like
 

13181
03:41:20,340 --> 03:41:22,550
because you'll have like
fomo for sure for the people who picked

13182
03:41:22,550 --> 03:41:22,560
fomo for sure for the people who picked
 

13183
03:41:22,560 --> 03:41:24,950
fomo for sure for the people who picked
300 years oh yeah

13184
03:41:24,950 --> 03:41:24,960
300 years oh yeah
 

13185
03:41:24,960 --> 03:41:28,070
300 years oh yeah
or not or the other man regret another

13186
03:41:28,070 --> 03:41:28,080
or not or the other man regret another
 

13187
03:41:28,080 --> 03:41:29,690
or not or the other man regret another
human thing

13188
03:41:29,690 --> 03:41:29,700
human thing
 

13189
03:41:29,700 --> 03:41:32,210
human thing
but you're like what does transhumanism

13190
03:41:32,210 --> 03:41:32,220
but you're like what does transhumanism
 

13191
03:41:32,220 --> 03:41:34,190
but you're like what does transhumanism
mean to you in general so extension of

13192
03:41:34,190 --> 03:41:34,200
mean to you in general so extension of
 

13193
03:41:34,200 --> 03:41:36,170
mean to you in general so extension of
the of life extension of what it means

13194
03:41:36,170 --> 03:41:36,180
the of life extension of what it means
 

13195
03:41:36,180 --> 03:41:39,490
the of life extension of what it means
to be and a living conscious being

13196
03:41:39,490 --> 03:41:39,500
to be and a living conscious being
 

13197
03:41:39,500 --> 03:41:42,050
to be and a living conscious being
you're all for it whatever that means

13198
03:41:42,050 --> 03:41:42,060
you're all for it whatever that means
 

13199
03:41:42,060 --> 03:41:43,309

yeah I didn't I never really thought
 

13201
03:41:43,319 --> 03:41:44,690
yeah I didn't I never really thought
about the term transhumanism for a lot

13202
03:41:44,690 --> 03:41:44,700
about the term transhumanism for a lot
 

13203
03:41:44,700 --> 03:41:46,190
about the term transhumanism for a lot
like people say to transference I'm like

13204
03:41:46,190 --> 03:41:46,200
like people say to transference I'm like
 

13205
03:41:46,200 --> 03:41:47,570
like people say to transference I'm like
I don't really care but I slowly

13206
03:41:47,570 --> 03:41:47,580
I don't really care but I slowly
 

13207
03:41:47,580 --> 03:41:49,910
I don't really care but I slowly
realized that my attitude is in fact at

13208
03:41:49,910 --> 03:41:49,920
realized that my attitude is in fact at
 

13209
03:41:49,920 --> 03:41:51,290
realized that my attitude is in fact at
least the thing that I am conceiving of

13210
03:41:51,290 --> 03:41:51,300
least the thing that I am conceiving of
 

13211
03:41:51,300 --> 03:41:53,929
least the thing that I am conceiving of
as trans-humanist like I'm very happy to

13212
03:41:53,929 --> 03:41:53,939
as trans-humanist like I'm very happy to
 

13213
03:41:53,939 --> 03:41:55,729
as trans-humanist like I'm very happy to
do artificial wounds and you know upload

13214
03:41:55,729 --> 03:41:55,739
do artificial wounds and you know upload
 

13215
03:41:55,739 --> 03:41:57,590
do artificial wounds and you know upload
our brains to the great Collective and

13216
03:41:57,590 --> 03:41:57,600
our brains to the great Collective and
 

13217
03:41:57,600 --> 03:41:59,570
our brains to the great Collective and
whatever I don't have the thing that I'm

13218
03:41:59,570 --> 03:41:59,580
whatever I don't have the thing that I'm
 

13219
03:41:59,580 --> 03:42:01,250
whatever I don't have the thing that I'm
like oh what about like the true organic

13220
03:42:01,250 --> 03:42:01,260
like oh what about like the true organic
 

13221
03:42:01,260 --> 03:42:03,050
like oh what about like the true organic
humanness that makes us who we are like

13222
03:42:03,050 --> 03:42:03,060
humanness that makes us who we are like
 

13223
03:42:03,060 --> 03:42:05,929
humanness that makes us who we are like
whatever that soul of humanity I have no

13224
03:42:05,929 --> 03:42:05,939
whatever that soul of humanity I have no
 

13225
03:42:05,939 --> 03:42:07,969
whatever that soul of humanity I have no
attachment to it at all which I think is

13226
03:42:07,969 --> 03:42:07,979
attachment to it at all which I think is
 

13227
03:42:07,979 --> 03:42:09,650
attachment to it at all which I think is
what I'm thinking of as transhumanist

13228
03:42:09,650 --> 03:42:09,660
what I'm thinking of as transhumanist
 

13229
03:42:09,660 --> 03:42:12,950
what I'm thinking of as transhumanist
I'm like so you're like I I guess the

13230
03:42:12,950 --> 03:42:12,960
I'm like so you're like I I guess the
 

13231
03:42:12,960 --> 03:42:15,170
I'm like so you're like I I guess the
the window of what you consider to be

13232
03:42:15,170 --> 03:42:15,180
the window of what you consider to be
 

13233
03:42:15,180 --> 03:42:17,750
the window of what you consider to be
beautiful about life is not limited to

13234
03:42:17,750 --> 03:42:17,760
beautiful about life is not limited to
 

13235
03:42:17,760 --> 03:42:20,690
beautiful about life is not limited to
this particular definition yeah

13236
03:42:20,690 --> 03:42:20,700
this particular definition yeah
 

13237
03:42:20,700 --> 03:42:23,090
this particular definition yeah
let's explode like let's make our

13238
03:42:23,090 --> 03:42:23,100
let's explode like let's make our
 

13239
03:42:23,100 --> 03:42:25,490
let's explode like let's make our
Consciousness is huge

13240
03:42:25,490 --> 03:42:25,500
Consciousness is huge
 

13241
03:42:25,500 --> 03:42:28,190
Consciousness is huge
so AI could be a part of that wait so

13242
03:42:28,190 --> 03:42:28,200
so AI could be a part of that wait so
 

13243
03:42:28,200 --> 03:42:30,710
so AI could be a part of that wait so
you're mostly excited by AI well I mean

13244
03:42:30,710 --> 03:42:30,720
you're mostly excited by AI well I mean
 

13245
03:42:30,720 --> 03:42:33,830
you're mostly excited by AI well I mean
I'm like part of like the Doomer cult uh

13246
03:42:33,830 --> 03:42:33,840
I'm like part of like the Doomer cult uh
 

13247
03:42:33,840 --> 03:42:35,330
I'm like part of like the Doomer cult uh
I wish I say tongue-in-cheek it's not

13248
03:42:35,330 --> 03:42:35,340
I wish I say tongue-in-cheek it's not
 

13249
03:42:35,340 --> 03:42:37,010
I wish I say tongue-in-cheek it's not
actually a doom or cult but I'm part of

13250
03:42:37,010 --> 03:42:37,020
actually a doom or cult but I'm part of
 

13251
03:42:37,020 --> 03:42:39,290

13252
03:42:39,290 --> 03:42:39,300
uh do you worship a god of some sort
 

13253
03:42:39,300 --> 03:42:41,690
uh do you worship a god of some sort
would you sacrifice little small animals

13254
03:42:41,690 --> 03:42:41,700
would you sacrifice little small animals
 

13255
03:42:41,700 --> 03:42:43,670
would you sacrifice little small animals
that would make it look cooler than what

13256
03:42:43,670 --> 03:42:43,680
that would make it look cooler than what
 

13257
03:42:43,680 --> 03:42:45,410
that would make it look cooler than what
it is it's mostly just a bunch of nerds

13258
03:42:45,410 --> 03:42:45,420
it is it's mostly just a bunch of nerds
 

13259
03:42:45,420 --> 03:42:47,150
it is it's mostly just a bunch of nerds
who are very concerned about AI sure

13260
03:42:47,150 --> 03:42:47,160
who are very concerned about AI sure
 

13261
03:42:47,160 --> 03:42:49,910
who are very concerned about AI sure
yeah so you're concerned about the the

13262
03:42:49,910 --> 03:42:49,920
yeah so you're concerned about the the
 

13263
03:42:49,920 --> 03:42:52,729
yeah so you're concerned about the the
existential risks of chat GPT

13264
03:42:52,729 --> 03:42:52,739
existential risks of chat GPT
 

13265
03:42:52,739 --> 03:42:55,010
existential risks of chat GPT
of you know what chat gbt will

13266
03:42:55,010 --> 03:42:55,020
of you know what chat gbt will
 

13267
03:42:55,020 --> 03:42:56,690
of you know what chat gbt will
eventually evolve into being yeah yeah

13268
03:42:56,690 --> 03:42:56,700
eventually evolve into being yeah yeah
 

13269
03:42:56,700 --> 03:42:59,570
eventually evolve into being yeah yeah
it's super exciting and terrifying how

13270
03:42:59,570 --> 03:42:59,580
it's super exciting and terrifying how
 

13271
03:42:59,580 --> 03:43:01,070
it's super exciting and terrifying how
quickly it's accelerating yeah like

13272
03:43:01,070 --> 03:43:01,080
quickly it's accelerating yeah like
 

13273
03:43:01,080 --> 03:43:03,769
quickly it's accelerating yeah like
language models are freaking me out yeah

13274
03:43:03,769 --> 03:43:03,779
language models are freaking me out yeah
 

13275
03:43:03,779 --> 03:43:06,590
language models are freaking me out yeah
it's very unexpected that it's the same

13276
03:43:06,590 --> 03:43:06,600
it's very unexpected that it's the same
 

13277
03:43:06,600 --> 03:43:10,849
it's very unexpected that it's the same
exact I mean Chad GPT is just gpd3 3.5

13278
03:43:10,849 --> 03:43:10,859
exact I mean Chad GPT is just gpd3 3.5
 

13279
03:43:10,859 --> 03:43:13,370
exact I mean Chad GPT is just gpd3 3.5
it's the same same model relatively

13280
03:43:13,370 --> 03:43:13,380
it's the same same model relatively
 

13281
03:43:13,380 --> 03:43:15,229
it's the same same model relatively
small to what it could be

13282
03:43:15,229 --> 03:43:15,239
small to what it could be
 

13283
03:43:15,239 --> 03:43:18,469
small to what it could be
uh to what gpt4 will be in the other

13284
03:43:18,469 --> 03:43:18,479
uh to what gpt4 will be in the other
 

13285
03:43:18,479 --> 03:43:19,670
uh to what gpt4 will be in the other
competitors

13286
03:43:19,670 --> 03:43:19,680
competitors
 

13287
03:43:19,680 --> 03:43:21,769
competitors
and just like a few tricks made it much

13288
03:43:21,769 --> 03:43:21,779
and just like a few tricks made it much
 

13289
03:43:21,779 --> 03:43:24,229
and just like a few tricks made it much
better in terms of interaction with

13290
03:43:24,229 --> 03:43:24,239
better in terms of interaction with
 

13291
03:43:24,239 --> 03:43:25,790
better in terms of interaction with
humans and then we'll keep discovering

13292
03:43:25,790 --> 03:43:25,800
humans and then we'll keep discovering
 

13293
03:43:25,800 --> 03:43:27,830
humans and then we'll keep discovering
extra tricks the thing I'm really

13294
03:43:27,830 --> 03:43:27,840
extra tricks the thing I'm really
 

13295
03:43:27,840 --> 03:43:29,870
extra tricks the thing I'm really
excited about is how everyone kind of

13296
03:43:29,870 --> 03:43:29,880
excited about is how everyone kind of
 

13297
03:43:29,880 --> 03:43:31,910
excited about is how everyone kind of
knows how it works so you can kind of

13298
03:43:31,910 --> 03:43:31,920
knows how it works so you can kind of
 

13299
03:43:31,920 --> 03:43:33,290
knows how it works so you can kind of
create especially with computation

13300
03:43:33,290 --> 03:43:33,300
create especially with computation
 

13301
03:43:33,300 --> 03:43:34,790
create especially with computation
becoming cheaper and cheaper you'll

13302
03:43:34,790 --> 03:43:34,800
becoming cheaper and cheaper you'll
 

13303
03:43:34,800 --> 03:43:37,010
becoming cheaper and cheaper you'll
there'll be a lot of competitors yeah

13304
03:43:37,010 --> 03:43:37,020
there'll be a lot of competitors yeah
 

13305
03:43:37,020 --> 03:43:39,710
there'll be a lot of competitors yeah
it's a little scary yeah it's terrifying

13306
03:43:39,710 --> 03:43:39,720
it's a little scary yeah it's terrifying
 

13307
03:43:39,720 --> 03:43:41,990
it's a little scary yeah it's terrifying
I mean because like like the everything

13308
03:43:41,990 --> 03:43:42,000
I mean because like like the everything
 

13309
03:43:42,000 --> 03:43:44,870
I mean because like like the everything
is just like information ultimately like

13310
03:43:44,870 --> 03:43:44,880
is just like information ultimately like
 

13311
03:43:44,880 --> 03:43:46,250
is just like information ultimately like
the items that we have like weird

13312
03:43:46,250 --> 03:43:46,260
the items that we have like weird
 

13313
03:43:46,260 --> 03:43:48,170
the items that we have like weird
biological machines built out of the

13314
03:43:48,170 --> 03:43:48,180
biological machines built out of the
 

13315
03:43:48,180 --> 03:43:49,969
biological machines built out of the
tiny code like our DNA is just

13316
03:43:49,969 --> 03:43:49,979
tiny code like our DNA is just
 

13317
03:43:49,979 --> 03:43:52,550
tiny code like our DNA is just
information it's not hard if you have

13318
03:43:52,550 --> 03:43:52,560
information it's not hard if you have
 

13319
03:43:52,560 --> 03:43:54,170
information it's not hard if you have
access if you're like have a brilliant

13320
03:43:54,170 --> 03:43:54,180
access if you're like have a brilliant
 

13321
03:43:54,180 --> 03:43:55,370
access if you're like have a brilliant
brain that's like great processing

13322
03:43:55,370 --> 03:43:55,380
brain that's like great processing
 

13323
03:43:55,380 --> 03:43:56,870
brain that's like great processing
information you have complete control

13324
03:43:56,870 --> 03:43:56,880
information you have complete control
 

13325
03:43:56,880 --> 03:43:58,969
information you have complete control
over reality yes you have control over

13326
03:43:58,969 --> 03:43:58,979
over reality yes you have control over
 

13327
03:43:58,979 --> 03:44:00,410
over reality yes you have control over
the atom's ready all you need is like a

13328
03:44:00,410 --> 03:44:00,420
the atom's ready all you need is like a
 

13329
03:44:00,420 --> 03:44:03,469
the atom's ready all you need is like a
tiny little like Atomic printer uh and

13330
03:44:03,469 --> 03:44:03,479
tiny little like Atomic printer uh and
 

13331
03:44:03,479 --> 03:44:06,050
tiny little like Atomic printer uh and
like we have those those are cells right

13332
03:44:06,050 --> 03:44:06,060
like we have those those are cells right
 

13333
03:44:06,060 --> 03:44:08,690
like we have those those are cells right
and and I'm like this is like if the

13334
03:44:08,690 --> 03:44:08,700
and and I'm like this is like if the
 

13335
03:44:08,700 --> 03:44:10,490
and and I'm like this is like if the
limitation is information there is no

13336
03:44:10,490 --> 03:44:10,500
limitation is information there is no
 

13337
03:44:10,500 --> 03:44:12,830
limitation is information there is no
boundary between the technology and the

13338
03:44:12,830 --> 03:44:12,840
boundary between the technology and the
 

13339
03:44:12,840 --> 03:44:13,729
boundary between the technology and the
real world

13340
03:44:13,729 --> 03:44:13,739
real world
 

13341
03:44:13,739 --> 03:44:15,769
real world
like we are creating something that it

13342
03:44:15,769 --> 03:44:15,779
like we are creating something that it
 

13343
03:44:15,779 --> 03:44:17,510
like we are creating something that it
has a massive ability to affect the real

13344
03:44:17,510 --> 03:44:17,520
has a massive ability to affect the real
 

13345
03:44:17,520 --> 03:44:20,929
has a massive ability to affect the real
world I mean it's hard to know where if

13346
03:44:20,929 --> 03:44:20,939
world I mean it's hard to know where if
 

13347
03:44:20,939 --> 03:44:22,790
world I mean it's hard to know where if
how difficult is to close that Gap to

13348
03:44:22,790 --> 03:44:22,800
how difficult is to close that Gap to
 

13349
03:44:22,800 --> 03:44:24,170
how difficult is to close that Gap to
physical reality

13350
03:44:24,170 --> 03:44:24,180
physical reality
 

13351
03:44:24,180 --> 03:44:27,469
physical reality
like from the physics to the the

13352
03:44:27,469 --> 03:44:27,479
like from the physics to the the
 

13353
03:44:27,479 --> 03:44:29,570
like from the physics to the the
information you have like all organic

13354
03:44:29,570 --> 03:44:29,580
information you have like all organic
 

13355
03:44:29,580 --> 03:44:32,690
information you have like all organic
life is that Gap it's all around us

13356
03:44:32,690 --> 03:44:32,700
life is that Gap it's all around us
 

13357
03:44:32,700 --> 03:44:34,610
life is that Gap it's all around us
yeah but it's hard to know like how to

13358
03:44:34,610 --> 03:44:34,620
yeah but it's hard to know like how to
 

13359
03:44:34,620 --> 03:44:38,809
yeah but it's hard to know like how to
to go from digital to printing life

13360
03:44:38,809 --> 03:44:38,819
to go from digital to printing life
 

13361
03:44:38,819 --> 03:44:40,849
to go from digital to printing life
I don't know we can we look you know

13362
03:44:40,849 --> 03:44:40,859
I don't know we can we look you know
 

13363
03:44:40,859 --> 03:44:42,769
I don't know we can we look you know
crisper and stuff you can order you can

13364
03:44:42,769 --> 03:44:42,779
crisper and stuff you can order you can
 

13365
03:44:42,779 --> 03:44:45,229
crisper and stuff you can order you can
just like make sure you see uh right

13366
03:44:45,229 --> 03:44:45,239
just like make sure you see uh right
 

13367
03:44:45,239 --> 03:44:46,849
just like make sure you see uh right
there's technical difficulties and

13368
03:44:46,849 --> 03:44:46,859
there's technical difficulties and
 

13369
03:44:46,859 --> 03:44:49,429
there's technical difficulties and
there's cost like at scale like the

13370
03:44:49,429 --> 03:44:49,439
there's cost like at scale like the
 

13371
03:44:49,439 --> 03:44:50,929
there's cost like at scale like the
terrifying thing about AI is it can

13372
03:44:50,929 --> 03:44:50,939
terrifying thing about AI is it can
 

13373
03:44:50,939 --> 03:44:53,769
terrifying thing about AI is it can
accelerate overnight the capabilities

13374
03:44:53,769 --> 03:44:53,779
accelerate overnight the capabilities
 

13375
03:44:53,779 --> 03:44:56,269
accelerate overnight the capabilities
but the printing of stuff they actually

13376
03:44:56,269 --> 03:44:56,279
but the printing of stuff they actually
 

13377
03:44:56,279 --> 03:44:58,969
but the printing of stuff they actually
changing physical reality

13378
03:44:58,969 --> 03:44:58,979
changing physical reality
 

13379
03:44:58,979 --> 03:45:01,250
changing physical reality
is very costly it's very difficult to

13380
03:45:01,250 --> 03:45:01,260
is very costly it's very difficult to
 

13381
03:45:01,260 --> 03:45:03,349
is very costly it's very difficult to
exponentially accelerate the more

13382
03:45:03,349 --> 03:45:03,359
exponentially accelerate the more
 

13383
03:45:03,359 --> 03:45:04,910
exponentially accelerate the more
terrifying things AI becoming

13384
03:45:04,910 --> 03:45:04,920
terrifying things AI becoming
 

13385
03:45:04,920 --> 03:45:06,229
terrifying things AI becoming
exponentially intelligent and then

13386
03:45:06,229 --> 03:45:06,239
exponentially intelligent and then
 

13387
03:45:06,239 --> 03:45:09,050
exponentially intelligent and then
controlling humans which there's many of

13388
03:45:09,050 --> 03:45:09,060
controlling humans which there's many of
 

13389
03:45:09,060 --> 03:45:12,410
controlling humans which there's many of
us yeah and then that's how we achieve

13390
03:45:12,410 --> 03:45:12,420
us yeah and then that's how we achieve
 

13391
03:45:12,420 --> 03:45:15,050
us yeah and then that's how we achieve
skin we humans build stuff or start wars

13392
03:45:15,050 --> 03:45:15,060
skin we humans build stuff or start wars
 

13393
03:45:15,060 --> 03:45:17,690
skin we humans build stuff or start wars
or or so on like it starts manipulating

13394
03:45:17,690 --> 03:45:17,700
or or so on like it starts manipulating
 

13395
03:45:17,700 --> 03:45:20,090
or or so on like it starts manipulating
our minds gets in our mind becomes our

13396
03:45:20,090 --> 03:45:20,100
our minds gets in our mind becomes our
 

13397
03:45:20,100 --> 03:45:21,229
our minds gets in our mind becomes our
friends

13398
03:45:21,229 --> 03:45:21,239
friends
 

13399
03:45:21,239 --> 03:45:24,190
friends
and then starts uh I don't know yeah

13400
03:45:24,190 --> 03:45:24,200
and then starts uh I don't know yeah
 

13401
03:45:24,200 --> 03:45:27,110
and then starts uh I don't know yeah
thinking this is unlikely it's like it's

13402
03:45:27,110 --> 03:45:27,120
thinking this is unlikely it's like it's
 

13403
03:45:27,120 --> 03:45:28,429
thinking this is unlikely it's like it's
probably going to be as smart to us as

13404
03:45:28,429 --> 03:45:28,439
probably going to be as smart to us as
 

13405
03:45:28,439 --> 03:45:30,530
probably going to be as smart to us as
like we are to toddlers so we toddlers

13406
03:45:30,530 --> 03:45:30,540
like we are to toddlers so we toddlers
 

13407
03:45:30,540 --> 03:45:32,090
like we are to toddlers so we toddlers
thinking that like oh we can prevent the

13408
03:45:32,090 --> 03:45:32,100
thinking that like oh we can prevent the
 

13409
03:45:32,100 --> 03:45:33,650
thinking that like oh we can prevent the
AI from coming in the room like as an

13410
03:45:33,650 --> 03:45:33,660
AI from coming in the room like as an
 

13411
03:45:33,660 --> 03:45:35,150
AI from coming in the room like as an
adult it's like not hard to trick a

13412
03:45:35,150 --> 03:45:35,160
adult it's like not hard to trick a
 

13413
03:45:35,160 --> 03:45:36,469
adult it's like not hard to trick a
toddler

13414
03:45:36,469 --> 03:45:36,479
toddler
 

13415
03:45:36,479 --> 03:45:38,690
toddler
what about falling in love in the AI

13416
03:45:38,690 --> 03:45:38,700
what about falling in love in the AI
 

13417
03:45:38,700 --> 03:45:39,530
what about falling in love in the AI
system

13418
03:45:39,530 --> 03:45:39,540
system
 

13419
03:45:39,540 --> 03:45:41,510
system
do you think you'll have a sincere like

13420
03:45:41,510 --> 03:45:41,520
do you think you'll have a sincere like
 

13421
03:45:41,520 --> 03:45:42,830
do you think you'll have a sincere like
this is the freedom you have being

13422
03:45:42,830 --> 03:45:42,840
this is the freedom you have being
 

13423
03:45:42,840 --> 03:45:44,510
this is the freedom you have being
polyamorous you can kind of can fall in

13424
03:45:44,510 --> 03:45:44,520
polyamorous you can kind of can fall in
 

13425
03:45:44,520 --> 03:45:47,150
polyamorous you can kind of can fall in
with an AI no you and like it not really

13426
03:45:47,150 --> 03:45:47,160
with an AI no you and like it not really
 

13427
03:45:47,160 --> 03:45:50,510
with an AI no you and like it not really
have to dedicate your commit fully

13428
03:45:50,510 --> 03:45:50,520
have to dedicate your commit fully
 

13429
03:45:50,520 --> 03:45:54,889
have to dedicate your commit fully
like sorry you still commit but you have

13430
03:45:54,889 --> 03:45:54,899
like sorry you still commit but you have
 

13431
03:45:54,899 --> 03:45:57,590
like sorry you still commit but you have
others humans who you can kind of

13432
03:45:57,590 --> 03:45:57,600
others humans who you can kind of
 

13433
03:45:57,600 --> 03:46:00,170
others humans who you can kind of
diversify to because like it's kind of a

13434
03:46:00,170 --> 03:46:00,180
diversify to because like it's kind of a
 

13435
03:46:00,180 --> 03:46:01,510
diversify to because like it's kind of a
big thing

13436
03:46:01,510 --> 03:46:01,520
big thing
 

13437
03:46:01,520 --> 03:46:04,010
big thing
to like

13438
03:46:04,010 --> 03:46:04,020
to like
 

13439
03:46:04,020 --> 03:46:07,130
to like
to come to a party and your boyfriend is

13440
03:46:07,130 --> 03:46:07,140
to come to a party and your boyfriend is
 

13441
03:46:07,140 --> 03:46:08,269
to come to a party and your boyfriend is
an AI

13442
03:46:08,269 --> 03:46:08,279
an AI
 

13443
03:46:08,279 --> 03:46:11,330
an AI
and that's monogamous boyfriend is an AI

13444
03:46:11,330 --> 03:46:11,340
and that's monogamous boyfriend is an AI
 

13445
03:46:11,340 --> 03:46:13,610
and that's monogamous boyfriend is an AI
it's an issue right why would it be an

13446
03:46:13,610 --> 03:46:13,620
it's an issue right why would it be an
 

13447
03:46:13,620 --> 03:46:15,530
it's an issue right why would it be an
issue all right now you're already

13448
03:46:15,530 --> 03:46:15,540
issue all right now you're already
 

13449
03:46:15,540 --> 03:46:17,630
issue all right now you're already
getting uh offended at that possibility

13450
03:46:17,630 --> 03:46:17,640
getting uh offended at that possibility
 

13451
03:46:17,640 --> 03:46:19,550
getting uh offended at that possibility
which they're therefore I know it's

13452
03:46:19,550 --> 03:46:19,560
which they're therefore I know it's
 

13453
03:46:19,560 --> 03:46:22,250
which they're therefore I know it's
going to be a reality no I'm just joking

13454
03:46:22,250 --> 03:46:22,260
going to be a reality no I'm just joking
 

13455
03:46:22,260 --> 03:46:23,570
going to be a reality no I'm just joking
there's an issue I don't actually think

13456
03:46:23,570 --> 03:46:23,580
there's an issue I don't actually think
 

13457
03:46:23,580 --> 03:46:25,910
there's an issue I don't actually think
it's an issue I think it's uh

13458
03:46:25,910 --> 03:46:25,920
it's an issue I think it's uh
 

13459
03:46:25,920 --> 03:46:27,349
it's an issue I think it's uh
maybe at The Cutting Edge will be an

13460
03:46:27,349 --> 03:46:27,359
maybe at The Cutting Edge will be an
 

13461
03:46:27,359 --> 03:46:29,330
maybe at The Cutting Edge will be an
issue but like assume they have a body I

13462
03:46:29,330 --> 03:46:29,340
issue but like assume they have a body I
 

13463
03:46:29,340 --> 03:46:31,130
issue but like assume they have a body I
assume

13464
03:46:31,130 --> 03:46:31,140
assume
 

13465
03:46:31,140 --> 03:46:32,870
assume
yeah I think yeah but the body will be

13466
03:46:32,870 --> 03:46:32,880
yeah I think yeah but the body will be
 

13467
03:46:32,880 --> 03:46:37,550
yeah I think yeah but the body will be
really like crappy it'd be like R2D2 I

13468
03:46:37,550 --> 03:46:37,560
really like crappy it'd be like R2D2 I
 

13469
03:46:37,560 --> 03:46:39,110
really like crappy it'd be like R2D2 I
like I feel like we grow human bodies

13470
03:46:39,110 --> 03:46:39,120
like I feel like we grow human bodies
 

13471
03:46:39,120 --> 03:46:40,729
like I feel like we grow human bodies
already from like just a tiny little

13472
03:46:40,729 --> 03:46:40,739
already from like just a tiny little
 

13473
03:46:40,739 --> 03:46:42,889
already from like just a tiny little
cluster of cells especially and so all

13474
03:46:42,889 --> 03:46:42,899
cluster of cells especially and so all
 

13475
03:46:42,899 --> 03:46:44,269
cluster of cells especially and so all
they have to do is make that cluster and

13476
03:46:44,269 --> 03:46:44,279
they have to do is make that cluster and
 

13477
03:46:44,279 --> 03:46:47,269
they have to do is make that cluster and
grow it no no no no like don't that that

13478
03:46:47,269 --> 03:46:47,279
grow it no no no no like don't that that
 

13479
03:46:47,279 --> 03:46:49,790
grow it no no no no like don't that that
that the embryogenesis process like

13480
03:46:49,790 --> 03:46:49,800
that the embryogenesis process like
 

13481
03:46:49,800 --> 03:46:51,790
that the embryogenesis process like
that's really not well understood at all

13482
03:46:51,790 --> 03:46:51,800
that's really not well understood at all
 

13483
03:46:51,800 --> 03:46:54,349
that's really not well understood at all
that's really tough I think more much

13484
03:46:54,349 --> 03:46:54,359
that's really tough I think more much
 

13485
03:46:54,359 --> 03:46:56,870
that's really tough I think more much
more likely to have crappy humanoid

13486
03:46:56,870 --> 03:46:56,880
more likely to have crappy humanoid
 

13487
03:46:56,880 --> 03:46:59,510
more likely to have crappy humanoid
robotics like I don't think the body is

13488
03:46:59,510 --> 03:46:59,520
robotics like I don't think the body is
 

13489
03:46:59,520 --> 03:47:01,910
robotics like I don't think the body is
overrated in terms of like if if the AI

13490
03:47:01,910 --> 03:47:01,920
overrated in terms of like if if the AI
 

13491
03:47:01,920 --> 03:47:03,650
overrated in terms of like if if the AI
system is super intelligent

13492
03:47:03,650 --> 03:47:03,660
system is super intelligent
 

13493
03:47:03,660 --> 03:47:07,429
system is super intelligent
it can uh use charm

13494
03:47:07,429 --> 03:47:07,439
it can uh use charm
 

13495
03:47:07,439 --> 03:47:10,429
it can uh use charm
to make up for the crappy body yeah I

13496
03:47:10,429 --> 03:47:10,439
to make up for the crappy body yeah I
 

13497
03:47:10,439 --> 03:47:11,809
to make up for the crappy body yeah I
don't know I feel like if I were an AI

13498
03:47:11,809 --> 03:47:11,819
don't know I feel like if I were an AI
 

13499
03:47:11,819 --> 03:47:13,309
don't know I feel like if I were an AI
system and I were super intelligent I

13500
03:47:13,309 --> 03:47:13,319
system and I were super intelligent I
 

13501
03:47:13,319 --> 03:47:14,450
system and I were super intelligent I
probably would be able to solve the

13502
03:47:14,450 --> 03:47:14,460
probably would be able to solve the
 

13503
03:47:14,460 --> 03:47:17,450
probably would be able to solve the
problem of like growing organic matter

13504
03:47:17,450 --> 03:47:17,460
problem of like growing organic matter
 

13505
03:47:17,460 --> 03:47:19,070
problem of like growing organic matter
and then I would obviously just do that

13506
03:47:19,070 --> 03:47:19,080
and then I would obviously just do that
 

13507
03:47:19,080 --> 03:47:20,809
and then I would obviously just do that
you just build exactly the organic

13508
03:47:20,809 --> 03:47:20,819
you just build exactly the organic
 

13509
03:47:20,819 --> 03:47:22,429
you just build exactly the organic
machine that you want sure that's like

13510
03:47:22,429 --> 03:47:22,439
machine that you want sure that's like
 

13511
03:47:22,439 --> 03:47:24,650
machine that you want sure that's like
super intelligence I I think like with

13512
03:47:24,650 --> 03:47:24,660
super intelligence I I think like with
 

13513
03:47:24,660 --> 03:47:26,630
super intelligence I I think like with
language I'm worried about before it

13514
03:47:26,630 --> 03:47:26,640
language I'm worried about before it
 

13515
03:47:26,640 --> 03:47:28,910
language I'm worried about before it
that she's super intelligence

13516
03:47:28,910 --> 03:47:28,920
that she's super intelligence
 

13517
03:47:28,920 --> 03:47:31,910
that she's super intelligence
like true AGI it'll just be really good

13518
03:47:31,910 --> 03:47:31,920
like true AGI it'll just be really good
 

13519
03:47:31,920 --> 03:47:35,050
like true AGI it'll just be really good
at talking yeah that's true and like it

13520
03:47:35,050 --> 03:47:35,060
at talking yeah that's true and like it
 

13521
03:47:35,060 --> 03:47:38,570
at talking yeah that's true and like it
I I just don't think intelligence is a

13522
03:47:38,570 --> 03:47:38,580
I I just don't think intelligence is a
 

13523
03:47:38,580 --> 03:47:41,750
I I just don't think intelligence is a
very diff like basically a scientist and

13524
03:47:41,750 --> 03:47:41,760
very diff like basically a scientist and
 

13525
03:47:41,760 --> 03:47:43,250
very diff like basically a scientist and
a super intelligent scientist is a

13526
03:47:43,250 --> 03:47:43,260
a super intelligent scientist is a
 

13527
03:47:43,260 --> 03:47:44,990
a super intelligent scientist is a
different thing than just a good

13528
03:47:44,990 --> 03:47:45,000
different thing than just a good
 

13529
03:47:45,000 --> 03:47:46,309
different thing than just a good
conversation instead of party that can

13530
03:47:46,309 --> 03:47:46,319
conversation instead of party that can
 

13531
03:47:46,319 --> 03:47:47,929
conversation instead of party that can
undress you with their words would you

13532
03:47:47,929 --> 03:47:47,939
undress you with their words would you
 

13533
03:47:47,939 --> 03:47:49,849
undress you with their words would you
would you date an AI

13534
03:47:49,849 --> 03:47:49,859
would you date an AI
 

13535
03:47:49,859 --> 03:47:52,490
would you date an AI
I much way before then I could see

13536
03:47:52,490 --> 03:47:52,500
I much way before then I could see
 

13537
03:47:52,500 --> 03:47:54,590
I much way before then I could see
myself being friend friends with an AI

13538
03:47:54,590 --> 03:47:54,600
myself being friend friends with an AI
 

13539
03:47:54,600 --> 03:47:57,110
myself being friend friends with an AI
system yeah but like people are friends

13540
03:47:57,110 --> 03:47:57,120
system yeah but like people are friends
 

13541
03:47:57,120 --> 03:48:00,410
system yeah but like people are friends
with uh inanimate objects and

13542
03:48:00,410 --> 03:48:00,420
with uh inanimate objects and
 

13543
03:48:00,420 --> 03:48:02,750
with uh inanimate objects and
I have there's a robot behind you a lot

13544
03:48:02,750 --> 03:48:02,760
I have there's a robot behind you a lot
 

13545
03:48:02,760 --> 03:48:06,469
I have there's a robot behind you a lot
of them there's I like Lego robots

13546
03:48:06,469 --> 03:48:06,479
of them there's I like Lego robots
 

13547
03:48:06,479 --> 03:48:08,870
of them there's I like Lego robots
they're interesting it's on the Shelf oh

13548
03:48:08,870 --> 03:48:08,880
they're interesting it's on the Shelf oh
 

13549
03:48:08,880 --> 03:48:10,729
they're interesting it's on the Shelf oh
it was so cool cool yep I don't even

13550
03:48:10,729 --> 03:48:10,739
it was so cool cool yep I don't even
 

13551
03:48:10,739 --> 03:48:12,050
it was so cool cool yep I don't even
notice that

13552
03:48:12,050 --> 03:48:12,060
notice that
 

13553
03:48:12,060 --> 03:48:15,290
notice that
yep yeah Lego robots are they they we

13554
03:48:15,290 --> 03:48:15,300
yep yeah Lego robots are they they we
 

13555
03:48:15,300 --> 03:48:17,269
yep yeah Lego robots are they they we
anthropomorphize them even more because

13556
03:48:17,269 --> 03:48:17,279
anthropomorphize them even more because
 

13557
03:48:17,279 --> 03:48:19,370
anthropomorphize them even more because
there's something about the movement of

13558
03:48:19,370 --> 03:48:19,380
there's something about the movement of
 

13559
03:48:19,380 --> 03:48:20,929
there's something about the movement of
like

13560
03:48:20,929 --> 03:48:20,939
like
 

13561
03:48:20,939 --> 03:48:23,450
like
uh some like a thing that steps up steps

13562
03:48:23,450 --> 03:48:23,460
uh some like a thing that steps up steps
 

13563
03:48:23,460 --> 03:48:25,130
uh some like a thing that steps up steps
and looks up at you that there's a power

13564
03:48:25,130 --> 03:48:25,140
and looks up at you that there's a power
 

13565
03:48:25,140 --> 03:48:27,769
and looks up at you that there's a power
to that versus like a Roomba that's just

13566
03:48:27,769 --> 03:48:27,779
to that versus like a Roomba that's just
 

13567
03:48:27,779 --> 03:48:29,510
to that versus like a Roomba that's just
like

13568
03:48:29,510 --> 03:48:29,520
like
 

13569
03:48:29,520 --> 03:48:31,250
like
running into the walls yeah I think once

13570
03:48:31,250 --> 03:48:31,260
running into the walls yeah I think once
 

13571
03:48:31,260 --> 03:48:32,750
running into the walls yeah I think once
as soon as we get like some sort of

13572
03:48:32,750 --> 03:48:32,760
as soon as we get like some sort of
 

13573
03:48:32,760 --> 03:48:35,150
as soon as we get like some sort of
empathetic expression on robot face it's

13574
03:48:35,150 --> 03:48:35,160
empathetic expression on robot face it's
 

13575
03:48:35,160 --> 03:48:36,889
empathetic expression on robot face it's
over so we're gonna be like oh it's so

13576
03:48:36,889 --> 03:48:36,899
over so we're gonna be like oh it's so
 

13577
03:48:36,899 --> 03:48:38,269
over so we're gonna be like oh it's so
cute it's gonna be so easy to make it

13578
03:48:38,269 --> 03:48:38,279
cute it's gonna be so easy to make it
 

13579
03:48:38,279 --> 03:48:39,469
cute it's gonna be so easy to make it
cute too

13580
03:48:39,469 --> 03:48:39,479
cute too
 

13581
03:48:39,479 --> 03:48:41,450
cute too
if that's what you want or you want like

13582
03:48:41,450 --> 03:48:41,460
if that's what you want or you want like
 

13583
03:48:41,460 --> 03:48:43,370
if that's what you want or you want like
a dominant like clearly this is what

13584
03:48:43,370 --> 03:48:43,380
a dominant like clearly this is what
 

13585
03:48:43,380 --> 03:48:46,309
a dominant like clearly this is what
women want as a dominator yeah with

13586
03:48:46,309 --> 03:48:46,319
women want as a dominator yeah with
 

13587
03:48:46,319 --> 03:48:48,530
women want as a dominator yeah with
strong hands yeah

13588
03:48:48,530 --> 03:48:48,540
strong hands yeah
 

13589
03:48:48,540 --> 03:48:51,349
strong hands yeah
and and kind of dumb

13590
03:48:51,349 --> 03:48:51,359
and and kind of dumb
 

13591
03:48:51,359 --> 03:48:53,450
and and kind of dumb
uh or not I don't know that you can

13592
03:48:53,450 --> 03:48:53,460
uh or not I don't know that you can
 

13593
03:48:53,460 --> 03:48:55,610

13963
03:55:26,160 --> 03:55:27,710
used to talking to somebody who feels
like some of the core way that they

13964
03:55:27,710 --> 03:55:27,720
like some of the core way that they
 

13965
03:55:27,720 --> 03:55:28,969
like some of the core way that they
approach the world is so different than

approach the world is so different than
mine like usually the differences that

13968
03:55:31,010 --> 03:55:31,020
mine like usually the differences that
 

13969
03:55:31,020 --> 03:55:32,450
mine like usually the differences that
arrive like higher up the tree but like

13970
03:55:32,450 --> 03:55:32,460
arrive like higher up the tree but like
 

13971
03:55:32,460 --> 03:55:33,650
arrive like higher up the tree but like
there's something about like your root

13972
03:55:33,650 --> 03:55:33,660
there's something about like your root
 

13973
03:55:33,660 --> 03:55:34,670
there's something about like your root
system that I think is very different

03:55:34,670 --> 03:55:34,680
system that I think is very different
 

13975
03:55:34,680 --> 03:55:36,769
system that I think is very different
from mine but also the way that you

13976
03:55:36,769 --> 03:55:36,779
from mine but also the way that you
 

13977
03:55:36,779 --> 03:55:38,929
from mine but also the way that you
engage with others is still flexible

13978
03:55:38,929 --> 03:55:38,939
engage with others is still flexible
 

13979

like usually when I encounter somebody
 

13981
03:55:40,560 --> 03:55:41,630
like usually when I encounter somebody
with such a different root system

13982
03:55:41,630 --> 03:55:41,640
with such a different root system
 

13983
03:55:41,640 --> 03:55:43,610
with such a different root system
there's like it's like more aggressive
