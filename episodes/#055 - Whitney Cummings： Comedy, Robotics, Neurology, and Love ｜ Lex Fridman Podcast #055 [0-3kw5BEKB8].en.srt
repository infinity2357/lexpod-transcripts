the unnecessary drama out of it and
possibility to sexualize them or be

possibility to sexualize them or be
 

439
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:49,730
possibility to sexualize them or be
triggered by any of that stuff so

440
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:49,740
triggered by any of that stuff so
 

441
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:52,130

00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:55,530
talking so on and then there's the
 

447
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:58,070

I know are like I would love for a robot
 

485
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:37,190

to replace me every now and then so it

486
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:37,200
to replace me every now and then so it
 

487
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,140
to replace me every now and then so it
can go to baby showers for me and it can

488
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:39,150
can go to baby showers for me and it can
 

489

cook dinner and whatever so I just think
that was an interesting place to explore

494
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:45,120
that was an interesting place to explore
 

495
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,820
that was an interesting place to explore
so her looking like me was a big part of

496
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:46,830
so her looking like me was a big part of
 

497
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:49,160
so her looking like me was a big part of
it now her looking like me just adds an

00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:49,170
it now her looking like me just adds an
 

499
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:52,000
it now her looking like me just adds an

got our year ago and she already looks
 

503
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,380
got our year ago and she already looks
younger than me so weird problem yeah

00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:57,390
younger than me so weird problem yeah
 

505
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:00,080
younger than me so weird problem yeah
but I think that her looking human was

506
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,090
but I think that her looking human was
 

507
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:02,270
but I think that her looking human was
the idea and I think that where we are

00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,060
the idea and I think that where we are
now please correct me if I'm wrong over

no it's an interesting or the opposite

530
00:10:30,939 --> 00:10:30,949
no it's an interesting or the opposite
 

531
00:10:30,949 --> 00:10:32,470
no it's an interesting or the opposite
if then you know me and you're like why

00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,400
I know this isn't real because you're
right here maybe it does the opposite we

536
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:36,410
right here maybe it does the opposite we
 

537
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:39,129
right here maybe it does the opposite we
have a very keen eye for human faces and

538
00:10:39,129 --> 00:10:39,139
have a very keen eye for human faces and
 

539
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,710
have a very keen eye for human faces and
they're able to detect strangeness

540
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:41,720
they're able to detect strangeness
 

541
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,509
they're able to detect strangeness
especially that one has to do with

00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:43,519
especially that one has to do with
 

543
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,759
especially that one has to do with
people we've whose faces we've seen a

545
00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:48,759
people we've whose faces we've seen a
lot of them so I tend to be a bigger fan

546
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:48,769
lot of them so I tend to be a bigger fan
 

547
00:10:48,769 --> 00:10:52,499
lot of them so I tend to be a bigger fan
of moving away completely from faces

548
00:10:52,499 --> 00:10:52,509
of moving away completely from faces
 

549
00:10:52,509 --> 00:10:55,480
of moving away completely from faces
recognizable faces no just human faces

550
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:55,490
recognizable faces no just human faces
 

551
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:56,949
recognizable faces no just human faces
at all in general because I think that's

552
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:56,959
at all in general because I think that's
 

553
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,869
at all in general because I think that's
where things get dicey and one thing I

554
00:10:58,869 --> 00:10:58,879
where things get dicey and one thing I
 

555
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:01,569
where things get dicey and one thing I
will say is I think my robot is more

556
00:11:01,569 --> 00:11:01,579
will say is I think my robot is more
 

557
00:11:01,579 --> 00:11:03,160
will say is I think my robot is more
realistic than other robots not

558
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:03,170
realistic than other robots not
 

559
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:05,230
realistic than other robots not
necessarily because you have seen me and

560
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:05,240
necessarily because you have seen me and
 

561
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,699
necessarily because you have seen me and
then you see heard you go oh they're so

562
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:06,709
then you see heard you go oh they're so
 

563
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:09,670
then you see heard you go oh they're so
similar but also because human faces are

564
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:09,680
similar but also because human faces are
 

565
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,800
similar but also because human faces are
flawed and asymmetrical and sometimes we

566
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:11,810
flawed and asymmetrical and sometimes we
 

567
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:13,449
flawed and asymmetrical and sometimes we
forget when we're making things that

568
00:11:13,449 --> 00:11:13,459
forget when we're making things that
 

569
00:11:13,459 --> 00:11:14,920
forget when we're making things that
supposed to look human we make them too

supposed to look human we make them too
 

571
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:16,809
supposed to look human we make them too
symmetrical and that's what makes them

572
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:16,819
symmetrical and that's what makes them
 

573
00:11:16,819 --> 00:11:19,240
symmetrical and that's what makes them
stop looking human so because they mold

574
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:19,250
stop looking human so because they mold
 

575
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,759

591
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,530
ya know the flaws is what it means to be
human so visually as well but I'm just a

fan of the idea of letting humans use a
 

595
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:44,559
fan of the idea of letting humans use a
little bit more imagination so just

little bit more imagination so just
 

597
00:11:44,569 --> 00:11:47,170

hearing the voice is enough for us

hearing the voice is enough for us
 

599
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,449
hearing the voice is enough for us
humans to then start imagining the

humans to then start imagining the
 

601
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:50,829
humans to then start imagining the
visual appearance that goes along with

visual appearance that goes along with
 

603
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:52,629
visual appearance that goes along with
that voice and you don't necessarily

604
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:52,639
that voice and you don't necessarily
 

605
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,210
that voice and you don't necessarily
need to work too hard on creating the

need to work too hard on creating the
 

607
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,009
need to work too hard on creating the

actual visual appearance mm-hmm so
 

609
00:11:57,019 --> 00:11:59,769
actual visual appearance mm-hmm so
there's some value to that when you step

there's some value to that when you step

733
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,930
have so the idea that you're afraid of
that I mean how many robots have killed

734
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:25,940
that I mean how many robots have killed
 

735
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:28,300
that I mean how many robots have killed
people how many humans have died at the

and be around a bunch of humans who
 

745
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,190
and be around a bunch of humans who
statistically the chances are much

746
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:39,200

judgement how irrational we are is the
 

753
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,380
judgement how irrational we are is the
worry is the exponential so it's you

754
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:50,390
worry is the exponential so it's you
 

755
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,460
worry is the exponential so it's you
know you could say the same thing about

756
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:51,470
know you could say the same thing about
 

757
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:54,250
know you could say the same thing about
nuclear weapons before we dropped on

758
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:54,260
nuclear weapons before we dropped on
 

759

Masaki so the worry that people have is
 

763
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,830
Masaki so the worry that people have is
the exponential growth so so it's like

764
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:00,840
the exponential growth so so it's like
 

765
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:05,210
the exponential growth so so it's like
oh it's fun and games right now but you

trying their best yeah despite what

00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:57,390
trying their best yeah despite what
 

809

815
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,070
Clinton gets elected it's more that it's
an incredibly complex system that we

816
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:07,080
an incredibly complex system that we
 

817
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,260
an incredibly complex system that we
don't and that's the worry it's so

818
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:09,270
don't and that's the worry it's so
 

819
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:13,160
don't and that's the worry it's so
complex and moves so fast that nobody

820
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:13,170
complex and moves so fast that nobody
 

821
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:15,620
complex and moves so fast that nobody
will be able to stop it once it happens

822
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:15,630
will be able to stop it once it happens
 

823
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:17,210
will be able to stop it once it happens
and let me ask the question this is a

824
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:17,220
and let me ask the question this is a
 

825
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:20,360
and let me ask the question this is a
very savage question yeah which is is

826
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:20,370
very savage question yeah which is is
 

827
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:23,870
very savage question yeah which is is
this just the next stage of evolution as

828
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:23,880
this just the next stage of evolution as
 

829
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,300
this just the next stage of evolution as
humans and people will die yes I mean

830
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:26,310
humans and people will die yes I mean
 

831
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:28,700
humans and people will die yes I mean
that's always happens you know is this

832
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:28,710
that's always happens you know is this
 

833
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:30,650
that's always happens you know is this
is just taking emotion out of it is this

834
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:30,660
is just taking emotion out of it is this
 

835
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:33,380
is just taking emotion out of it is this
basically the next stage of survival of

836
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:33,390
basically the next stage of survival of
 

837
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:35,990
basically the next stage of survival of
the fittest yeah you have to think of

838
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:36,000
the fittest yeah you have to think of
 

839
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,590
the fittest yeah you have to think of
organisms you know what is it mean to be

840
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:39,600
organisms you know what is it mean to be
 

841
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,170
organisms you know what is it mean to be
a living organism like it's a smartphone

842
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:42,180
a living organism like it's a smartphone
 

843
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:46,910
a living organism like it's a smartphone
part of your living organism or where

844
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:46,920
part of your living organism or where
 

845
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,310
part of your living organism or where
we're in relationships with our phones

846
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:49,320
we're in relationships with our phones
 

847
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,820
we're in relationships with our phones
yeah but it's sex through them with them

848
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:52,830
yeah but it's sex through them with them
 

849
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:53,780
yeah but it's sex through them with them
what's the difference between with them

850
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:53,790
what's the difference between with them
 

851
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:55,970
what's the difference between with them
and through them but it also expands

852
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:55,980
and through them but it also expands
 

853
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,560
and through them but it also expands
your cognitive abilities expands your

854
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:57,570
your cognitive abilities expands your
 

855
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:59,420
your cognitive abilities expands your
memory knowledge and so on so you're a

856
00:16:59,420 --> 00:16:59,430
memory knowledge and so on so you're a
 

857
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:01,220
memory knowledge and so on so you're a
much smarter person because you have a

858
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:01,230
much smarter person because you have a
 

859
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,050
much smarter person because you have a
smart phone in your hand but if what as

860
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:03,060
smart phone in your hand but if what as
 

861
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,090
smart phone in your hand but if what as
soon as it's out of my hands we've got

862
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:05,100
soon as it's out of my hands we've got
 

863
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,189
soon as it's out of my hands we've got
big problems because we become sort of

864
00:17:07,189 --> 00:17:07,199
big problems because we become sort of
 

865
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,370
big problems because we become sort of
so morphed with them

866
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:08,380
so morphed with them
 

867
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:10,049
so morphed with them
with an assembly otic relationship and

868
00:17:10,049 --> 00:17:10,059
with an assembly otic relationship and
 

869
00:17:10,059 --> 00:17:12,179
with an assembly otic relationship and
that's what the er mosque when you're a

870
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:12,189
that's what the er mosque when you're a
 

871
00:17:12,189 --> 00:17:15,870
that's what the er mosque when you're a
link is working on trying to increase

872
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:15,880
link is working on trying to increase
 

873
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,490

the bandwidth communication between

874
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:17,500
the bandwidth communication between
 

875
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,980
the bandwidth communication between
computers and your brain and so further

876
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:19,990
computers and your brain and so further
 

877
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:23,189
computers and your brain and so further
and further expand our ability as human

878
00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:23,199
and further expand our ability as human
 

879
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,460
and further expand our ability as human
beings to sort of leverage machines and

880
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:26,470
beings to sort of leverage machines and
 

881
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:29,190
beings to sort of leverage machines and
maybe that's the future the evolution

882
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:29,200
maybe that's the future the evolution
 

883
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,200
maybe that's the future the evolution
next evolutionary step it could be also

884
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:31,210
next evolutionary step it could be also
 

885
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:34,409
next evolutionary step it could be also
that yes we'll give birth just like we

886
00:17:34,409 --> 00:17:34,419
that yes we'll give birth just like we
 

887

that yes we'll give birth just like we
give birth to human children right now

888
00:17:36,029 --> 00:17:36,039
give birth to human children right now
 

889
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:38,520
give birth to human children right now
to give birth day I in other places I

lower-income people so and women for the
 

929
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:22,680
lower-income people so and women for the
most part so the idea of something

930
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:22,690
most part so the idea of something
 

931
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:24,510
most part so the idea of something
that's stronger than us and that might

932
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:24,520
that's stronger than us and that might
 

933
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,830
that's stronger than us and that might
eventually kill us like women are used

934
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:25,840
eventually kill us like women are used
 

935
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,350
eventually kill us like women are used
to that like that's not I see a lot of

solution you know firefighters are
heroes but they're limited and how many

998
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:28,360
heroes but they're limited and how many
 

999
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,060
heroes but they're limited and how many
times they can run into a fire you know

1000
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:30,070
times they can run into a fire you know
 

1001
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:32,250

income more vulnerable populations
 

1007
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,530

actually a few female writers and

1014
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:48,340
actually a few female writers and
 

1015
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,250
actually a few female writers and
roboticist I've talked to express this

1016
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:50,260
roboticist I've talked to express this
 

1017
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:55,040
roboticist I've talked to express this
idea that exactly you just said which is

1018
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:55,050
idea that exactly you just said which is
 

1019
00:19:55,050 --> 00:20:00,320
idea that exactly you just said which is
it just seems that being being afraid of

00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:00,330
it just seems that being being afraid of
 

1021
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:02,340
it just seems that being being afraid of
existential threats of artificial

1022
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:02,350
existential threats of artificial
 

1023
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:07,080

1073
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:57,270
we're generally in a little more danger
than you guys are so I think that robots

1074
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:57,280
than you guys are so I think that robots
 

1075
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,890
than you guys are so I think that robots
are a little less scary to us because we

1076
00:20:58,890 --> 00:20:58,900
are a little less scary to us because we
 

1077
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,630
are a little less scary to us because we
could see them maybe as like free

1078
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:00,640
could see them maybe as like free
 

1079
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,840
could see them maybe as like free
assistance help and protection and then

1080
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:03,850
assistance help and protection and then
 

1081
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:05,670
assistance help and protection and then
there's sort of another element for me

1082
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:05,680
there's sort of another element for me
 

1083
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,950
there's sort of another element for me
personally which is maybe more of a

1084
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:07,960
personally which is maybe more of a
 

1085
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,540
personally which is maybe more of a
female problem I don't know I'm just

1086
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:09,550
female problem I don't know I'm just
 

1087
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:12,060
female problem I don't know I'm just
gonna make a generalization I'm happy to

1088
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:12,070
gonna make a generalization I'm happy to
 

1089
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:16,110
gonna make a generalization I'm happy to
be wrong but you know the emotional sort

1090
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:16,120
be wrong but you know the emotional sort
 

1091
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:19,140
be wrong but you know the emotional sort
of component of robots and what they can

1092
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:19,150
of component of robots and what they can
 

1093
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:22,740
of component of robots and what they can
provide in terms of you know there I

1094
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:22,750
provide in terms of you know there I
 

1095
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:23,790
provide in terms of you know there I
think there's a lot of people that

1096
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:23,800
think there's a lot of people that
 

1097
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,100
think there's a lot of people that
aren't don't have microphones that I

1098

aren't don't have microphones that I
 

1099
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:28,710
aren't don't have microphones that I
just recently kind of stumbled upon in

1100
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:28,720

another crime you go okay this is you
 

1263
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:30,810
another crime you go okay this is you
know it's all the same stuff and I think

1264
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:30,820
know it's all the same stuff and I think
 

1265
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:33,030
know it's all the same stuff and I think
people probably think I'm nuts for the a

1266
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:33,040
people probably think I'm nuts for the a

lot of the animal work I do but because
when animal abuse is president another

1270
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:37,270
when animal abuse is president another
 

1271
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:39,360
when animal abuse is president another
crime is always present but the animal

1272
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:39,370
crime is always present but the animal
 

1273
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:40,770
crime is always present but the animal
abuse is the most socially acceptable

1274
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:40,780
abuse is the most socially acceptable
 

1275
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:43,410
abuse is the most socially acceptable
you can kick a dog and there's nothing

1276
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:43,420
you can kick a dog and there's nothing
 

1277
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,700
you can kick a dog and there's nothing
people can do but then what they're

1278
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:44,710
people can do but then what they're
 

1279
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:47,190
people can do but then what they're
doing behind closed doors you can't see

1280
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:47,200
doing behind closed doors you can't see
 

1281
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,630
doing behind closed doors you can't see
so there's always something else going

1282
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:48,640
so there's always something else going
 

1283
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,040
so there's always something else going
on which is why I never feel compassion

1284
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:50,050
on which is why I never feel compassion
 

1285
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:51,690
on which is why I never feel compassion
about it but I do think we'll start

1286
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:51,700
about it but I do think we'll start
 

1287
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,450
about it but I do think we'll start
seeing the same thing with robots the

1288
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:54,460
seeing the same thing with robots the
 

1289
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,370
seeing the same thing with robots the
person that kicks them I felt compassion

1290
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:56,380
person that kicks them I felt compassion
 

1291
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:59,970
person that kicks them I felt compassion
when the kicking the dog robot really

1292
00:24:59,970 --> 00:24:59,980
when the kicking the dog robot really
 

1293
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:00,510
when the kicking the dog robot really
pissed me off

the stability right and all that but I

1298
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:05,770
the stability right and all that but I
 

1299
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:07,440
the stability right and all that but I
do think there will come a time where

1300
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:07,450
do think there will come a time where
 

1301
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:10,170
do think there will come a time where
that will be a great way to be able to

00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:13,440
on this thing and stamp out surveillance
it's like that's why we invented Santa

1366
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:13,450
it's like that's why we invented Santa
 

1367
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:15,660
it's like that's why we invented Santa
Claus you know it's the Santa Claus is

Claus you know it's the Santa Claus is
 

1369
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:18,060
Claus you know it's the Santa Claus is
the first surveillance basically all we

1370
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:18,070
the first surveillance basically all we
 

1371
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:20,010
the first surveillance basically all we
have to say to kids is he's making a

1372
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:20,020
have to say to kids is he's making a
 

1373
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:22,049
have to say to kids is he's making a
list and he's watching you and that

1374
00:26:22,049 --> 00:26:22,059
list and he's watching you and that

1377
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:25,500
behaved better I was brilliant you know
so I do I do think that there are

1378
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:25,510
so I do I do think that there are
 

1379
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:27,900
so I do I do think that there are
benefits to surveillance you know I

1380
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:27,910
benefits to surveillance you know I
 

1381
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:30,419
benefits to surveillance you know I
think we all do sketchy things in

1382
00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:30,429
think we all do sketchy things in
 

1383
00:26:30,429 --> 00:26:32,190
think we all do sketchy things in
private and we all have watched weird

1384
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:32,200
private and we all have watched weird
 

1385
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,620
private and we all have watched weird
porn or googled weird things and we

1386
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:34,630
porn or googled weird things and we
 

1387
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:35,880
porn or googled weird things and we
don't we don't want people to know about

1388
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:35,890
don't we don't want people to know about
 

1389
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:38,549
don't we don't want people to know about
it the our secret lives so I do think

1390
00:26:38,549 --> 00:26:38,559
it the our secret lives so I do think
 

1391
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,770
it the our secret lives so I do think
that obviously there's we should be able

1392
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:40,780
that obviously there's we should be able
 

1393
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:43,590
that obviously there's we should be able
to have a modicum of privacy but I tend

1394
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:43,600
to have a modicum of privacy but I tend
 

1395
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,590
to have a modicum of privacy but I tend
to think the people that are the most

1396
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:45,600
to think the people that are the most
 

1397
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,480
to think the people that are the most
negative about surveillance of the most

1398
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:48,490
negative about surveillance of the most
 

1399
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:52,710
negative about surveillance of the most

a species we are able to be in denial
about mass denial and mass delusion and

about mass denial and mass delusion and
 

1587
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,799
about mass denial and mass delusion and
how we're able to do human eyes and do

1588

to conform and find protection and the
 

1595
00:30:38,259 --> 00:30:41,129
to conform and find protection and the
conforming so we are also a species who

conforming so we are also a species who
 

1597
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:44,899

people people didn't see anything wrong
with it so we're a species that is able

1614
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:01,720
with it so we're a species that is able
 

1615

and make that you know so I think it
 

1631
00:31:21,669 --> 00:31:22,950
and make that you know so I think it
just that's a lot about the fact that

1632
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:22,960
just that's a lot about the fact that
 

1633
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,600
just that's a lot about the fact that
you know we are animals and we are

1634
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:24,610
you know we are animals and we are
 

1635
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:26,549
you know we are animals and we are
self-serving and one of the most

1636
00:31:26,549 --> 00:31:26,559
self-serving and one of the most
 

1637
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,580
self-serving and one of the most
successful the most successful species

1638
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:28,590
successful the most successful species
 

1639
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:32,460
successful the most successful species
because we are able to debase and

1640
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:32,470
because we are able to debase and
 

1641
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:35,430
because we are able to debase and
degrade and essentially exploit anything

1642
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:35,440
degrade and essentially exploit anything
 

1643
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,590
degrade and essentially exploit anything
that benefits us I think the pendulum is

1644
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:37,600
that benefits us I think the pendulum is
 

1645
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:41,039
that benefits us I think the pendulum is
gonna swing as being lately like I think

1646
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:41,049
gonna swing as being lately like I think
 

1647
00:31:41,049 --> 00:31:42,869
gonna swing as being lately like I think
we're wrong now kind of like I think

1648
00:31:42,869 --> 00:31:42,879
we're wrong now kind of like I think
 

1649
00:31:42,879 --> 00:31:45,269
we're wrong now kind of like I think
we're on the verge of collapse because

1650
00:31:45,269 --> 00:31:45,279
we're on the verge of collapse because
 

1651
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:47,639
we're on the verge of collapse because
we are dopamine receptors like we are

1652
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:47,649
we are dopamine receptors like we are
 

1653
00:31:47,649 --> 00:31:49,440
we are dopamine receptors like we are
just I think we're all kind of addicts

1654
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:49,450
just I think we're all kind of addicts
 

1655
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:50,820
just I think we're all kind of addicts
when it comes to this stuff like we

1656
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:50,830
when it comes to this stuff like we
 

1657
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:53,999
when it comes to this stuff like we
don't know when to stop it's always the

1658
00:31:53,999 --> 00:31:54,009
don't know when to stop it's always the
 

1659
00:31:54,009 --> 00:31:55,830
don't know when to stop it's always the
buffet like we're the thing that used to

1660
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:55,840
buffet like we're the thing that used to
 

1661
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,480
buffet like we're the thing that used to
keep us alive which is killing animals

1662
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:57,490
keep us alive which is killing animals
 

1663
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:59,369
keep us alive which is killing animals
and eating them now killing animals and

1664
00:31:59,369 --> 00:31:59,379
and eating them now killing animals and
 

1665
00:31:59,379 --> 00:32:00,960
and eating them now killing animals and
eating them is what's killing us in a

1666
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:00,970
eating them is what's killing us in a
 

1667
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:03,149
eating them is what's killing us in a
way so it's like we just can't we don't

1668
00:32:03,149 --> 00:32:03,159
way so it's like we just can't we don't
 

1669
00:32:03,159 --> 00:32:04,649
way so it's like we just can't we don't
know when to call it and we don't

1670
00:32:04,649 --> 00:32:04,659
know when to call it and we don't
 

1671
00:32:04,659 --> 00:32:06,359
know when to call it and we don't
moderation it's not really something

1672
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:06,369
moderation it's not really something
 

1673
00:32:06,369 --> 00:32:10,200
moderation it's not really something
that humans have evolved to have yet so

1674
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:10,210
that humans have evolved to have yet so
 

1675
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:12,149
that humans have evolved to have yet so
I think it's really just a flaw in our

1676
00:32:12,149 --> 00:32:12,159
I think it's really just a flaw in our
 

1677
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:14,759
I think it's really just a flaw in our
wiring do you think we'll look back at

1678
00:32:14,759 --> 00:32:14,769
wiring do you think we'll look back at
 

1679
00:32:14,769 --> 00:32:18,749
wiring do you think we'll look back at
this time as our society is being deeply

1680
00:32:18,749 --> 00:32:18,759
this time as our society is being deeply
 

1681
00:32:18,759 --> 00:32:21,060
this time as our society is being deeply
unethical yeah yeah I think we'll be

1682
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:21,070
unethical yeah yeah I think we'll be
 

1683
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:23,220

embarrassed which are the worst parts
 

1685
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:26,700
embarrassed which are the worst parts
right now going on is it well I think no

in terms of anything
 

1689
00:32:27,549 --> 00:32:29,999
in terms of anything
what's the unethical thing if we it's

1690
00:32:29,999 --> 00:32:30,009
what's the unethical thing if we it's
 

1691
00:32:30,009 --> 00:32:32,190
what's the unethical thing if we it's
very hard to take a step out of it but

1692
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:32,200
very hard to take a step out of it but
 

1693
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:36,499
very hard to take a step out of it but
you just said we used to watch you know

1714
00:32:58,529 --> 00:32:58,539
I think we have this narrative that
 

1715
00:32:58,539 --> 00:32:59,820
I think we have this narrative that
they're pigs and they're pigs and

1716
00:32:59,820 --> 00:32:59,830
they're pigs and they're pigs and
 

1717
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:01,409
they're pigs and they're pigs and
they're they're disgusting and they're

1718
00:33:01,409 --> 00:33:01,419
they're they're disgusting and they're
 

1719
00:33:01,419 --> 00:33:03,269
they're they're disgusting and they're
dirty and their bacon is so I think that

1720
00:33:03,269 --> 00:33:03,279
dirty and their bacon is so I think that
 

1721
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:04,680
dirty and their bacon is so I think that
we'll look back one day and be really

1722
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:04,690
we'll look back one day and be really
 

1723
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:07,590
we'll look back one day and be really
embarrassed about that is this for just

1724
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:07,600
embarrassed about that is this for just
 

1725
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,200
embarrassed about that is this for just
uh what's it called the factory farming

1726
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:10,210
uh what's it called the factory farming
 

1727
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:12,180
uh what's it called the factory farming
so basically mess because we don't see

1728
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:12,190
so basically mess because we don't see
 

1729
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:14,759
so basically mess because we don't see
it if you saw I mean we do have I mean

1730
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:14,769
it if you saw I mean we do have I mean
 

1731
00:33:14,769 --> 00:33:17,220
it if you saw I mean we do have I mean
this is probably an evolutionary

1732
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:17,230
this is probably an evolutionary
 

1733
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:18,450
this is probably an evolutionary
advantage we do have the ability to

1734
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:18,460
advantage we do have the ability to
 

1735
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:21,359
advantage we do have the ability to
completely pretend something's not

1736
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:21,369
completely pretend something's not
 

1737
00:33:21,369 --> 00:33:22,830
completely pretend something's not
something that is so horrific that it

1738
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:22,840
something that is so horrific that it
 

1739
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,340
something that is so horrific that it
overwhelms us and we're able to

1740
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:25,350
overwhelms us and we're able to
 

1741
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:27,570
overwhelms us and we're able to
essentially deny that it's happening I

1742
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:27,580
essentially deny that it's happening I
 

1743
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,100
essentially deny that it's happening I
think if people were to see what goes on

1744
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:29,110
think if people were to see what goes on
 

1745
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:31,320
think if people were to see what goes on
in factory farming and also we're really

1746
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:31,330
in factory farming and also we're really
 

1747
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:35,430
in factory farming and also we're really
to take in how bad it is for us you know

1748
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:35,440
to take in how bad it is for us you know
 

1749

to take in how bad it is for us you know
we're hurting ourselves first and

1750
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:36,610
we're hurting ourselves first and
 

1751
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:38,519
we're hurting ourselves first and
foremost with what what we eat but

00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:38,529
foremost with what what we eat but
 

1753
00:33:38,529 --> 00:33:40,320
foremost with what what we eat but
that's also a very elitist argument you

1754
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:40,330
that's also a very elitist argument you
 

1755
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:42,779
that's also a very elitist argument you
know it's a luxury to be able to

1756
00:33:42,779 --> 00:33:42,789
know it's a luxury to be able to
 

1757

1761
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:50,039
able to not eat meat you know there's
very few people because of you know how

even think that way
 

1775
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,810
even think that way
but I do think that animals in captivity

1776
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:03,820
but I do think that animals in captivity
 

1777
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:05,159
but I do think that animals in captivity
I think we're gonna look back and be

I think we're gonna look back and be
 

1779

already starting to dismantle circuses
 

1785
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:13,159

we're gonna be pretty embarrassed about
but I think it's really more testament

1788
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:15,700
but I think it's really more testament
 

1789
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:21,089
but I think it's really more testament
to you know there's just such a ability

1790
00:34:21,089 --> 00:34:21,099
to you know there's just such a ability
 

1791
00:34:21,099 --> 00:34:24,599
to you know there's just such a ability
to go like that thing is different than

it's just we have the species with the
 

1797
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,669
it's just we have the species with the
biggest ego ultimately well that's what

1798
00:34:29,669 --> 00:34:29,679
biggest ego ultimately well that's what
 

1799
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,710
biggest ego ultimately well that's what
I think that that's my hope for robots

1800
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:31,720
I think that that's my hope for robots
 

1801
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,480
I think that that's my hope for robots
is they'll you mentioned consciousness

1802
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:33,490
is they'll you mentioned consciousness
 

1803
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:36,750
is they'll you mentioned consciousness
before nobody knows what consciousness

1804
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:36,760
before nobody knows what consciousness
 

1805
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,869
before nobody knows what consciousness
is but I'm hoping

1806
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:38,879
is but I'm hoping
 

1807
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:42,059
is but I'm hoping
robots will help us empathize and

1808
00:34:42,059 --> 00:34:42,069
robots will help us empathize and
 

1809
00:34:42,069 --> 00:34:46,099
robots will help us empathize and
understand that that there's other

1810
00:34:46,099 --> 00:34:46,109
understand that that there's other
 

1811
00:34:46,109 --> 00:34:49,230
understand that that there's other
creatures out besides ourselves that can

1812
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:49,240
creatures out besides ourselves that can
 

1813
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:53,639
creatures out besides ourselves that can
suffer that can they can experience the

1814
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:53,649
suffer that can they can experience the
 

1815
00:34:53,649 --> 00:34:57,030
suffer that can they can experience the
world and that we can torture by our

1816
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:57,040
world and that we can torture by our
 

1817
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,430
world and that we can torture by our
actions and robots can explicitly teach

1818
00:34:59,430 --> 00:34:59,440
actions and robots can explicitly teach
 

1819
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,260
actions and robots can explicitly teach
us that I think better than animals can

1820
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:01,270
us that I think better than animals can
 

1821

amygdala was activated and that's why I
 

2355

amygdala was activated and that's why I
said you're an [\h__\h] and get out and

to learn about it and I started you know
 

2421
00:46:58,200 --> 00:46:59,780
to learn about it and I started you know
learning that we don't really know that

pains you can probably have all that
stuff and we don't know the source we

2436
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:13,440
stuff and we don't know the source we
 

2437
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,170
stuff and we don't know the source we
don't know the source and there is

don't know the source and there is
 

2439
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:17,540
don't know the source and there is
something really fascinating about when

2440
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:17,550
something really fascinating about when
 

2441

but I can't read them they just look
 

2455
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:33,650
but I can't read them they just look
like symbols to me so there's something

functioning and I so I just wanted to
 

2463
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:41,930
functioning and I so I just wanted to
learn about it study about it I did all

with it you know 28 years old when it
 

2483
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:03,320
with it you know 28 years old when it
happened and I started spending

00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:07,710
used with neurologists learning about
 

2489
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:09,710

what happened to my dad's brain and why

2490
00:48:09,710 --> 00:48:09,720
what happened to my dad's brain and why
 

2491
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,450
what happened to my dad's brain and why
he can't move his left arm but he can

2492
00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:11,460

another stroke
 

2499
00:48:17,039 --> 00:48:18,169
another stroke
in a different part of the brain so I

2500
00:48:18,169 --> 00:48:18,179
in a different part of the brain so I
 

2501
00:48:18,179 --> 00:48:20,209
in a different part of the brain so I
started having to learn what parts of

2502
00:48:20,209 --> 00:48:20,219
started having to learn what parts of
 

2503
00:48:20,219 --> 00:48:22,279
started having to learn what parts of
the brain did what and so that I

2504
00:48:22,279 --> 00:48:22,289
the brain did what and so that I
 

2505
00:48:22,289 --> 00:48:23,719
the brain did what and so that I
wouldn't take the behavior so personally

2506
00:48:23,719 --> 00:48:23,729
wouldn't take the behavior so personally
 

2507
00:48:23,729 --> 00:48:25,130
wouldn't take the behavior so personally
and so that I would be able to manage my

and so that I would be able to manage my
 

2509
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:26,749
and so that I would be able to manage my
expectations in terms of their recovery

2510
00:48:26,749 --> 00:48:26,759
expectations in terms of their recovery
 

2511

2525
00:48:41,789 --> 00:48:42,739
yeah will destroy hit this part of the
brain and that's the one that's

2526
00:48:42,739 --> 00:48:42,749
brain and that's the one that's
 

2527
00:48:42,749 --> 00:48:44,299
brain and that's the one that's
responsible for short-term memory and

2528
00:48:44,299 --> 00:48:44,309
responsible for short-term memory and
 

2529
00:48:44,309 --> 00:48:45,679
responsible for short-term memory and
that's responsible for long-term memory

2530

00:48:48,229 --> 00:48:48,239
set it up and then my brother just got
 

2533

00:48:49,779 --> 00:48:49,789
something called viral encephalitis
 

2535
00:48:49,789 --> 00:48:52,519
something called viral encephalitis
which is an infection inside the brain

2536
00:48:52,519 --> 00:48:52,529
which is an infection inside the brain
 

2537
00:48:52,529 --> 00:48:55,579
which is an infection inside the brain
and so Wow it was kind of wild that I

2538
00:48:55,579 --> 00:48:55,589
and so Wow it was kind of wild that I
 

2539
00:48:55,589 --> 00:48:57,109
and so Wow it was kind of wild that I
was able to go oh I know exactly what's

compassion for the struggles that people
 

2547

2562
00:49:22,669 --> 00:49:22,679
that's what stand-up is is just trying
 

2563
00:49:22,679 --> 00:49:24,049
that's what stand-up is is just trying
to figure out why or that's what writing

2564
00:49:24,049 --> 00:49:24,059
to figure out why or that's what writing
 

2565
00:49:24,059 --> 00:49:25,309
to figure out why or that's what writing
is that's what acting is that's what

00:49:29,309 --> 00:49:31,130
actor you get a piece of you know
material and you go this person why

2574
00:49:31,130 --> 00:49:31,140
material and you go this person why
 

2575
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:33,109
material and you go this person why
would he say that why would he pick up

it's really why why would why so I think

2580
00:49:36,979 --> 00:49:36,989
it's really why why would why so I think
 

2581
00:49:36,989 --> 00:49:39,199
it's really why why would why so I think

see yeah so you can leverage that
 

2909
00:55:49,579 --> 00:55:52,210
see yeah so you can leverage that
momentum so this is why in any toe step

2910
00:55:52,210 --> 00:55:52,220
momentum so this is why in any toe step
 

2911

01:07:34,390 --> 01:07:34,400
that we don't see objects as having
 

3541
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:36,190
that we don't see objects as having
Souls like that's kind of specifically

3542
01:07:36,190 --> 01:07:36,200
Souls like that's kind of specifically
 

3543
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:38,440
Souls like that's kind of specifically
us but um I don't think it's so much

3544
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:38,450
us but um I don't think it's so much
 

3545
01:07:38,450 --> 01:07:42,130
us but um I don't think it's so much
that we're objectifying humans with

3546
01:07:42,130 --> 01:07:42,140
that we're objectifying humans with
 

3547
01:07:42,140 --> 01:07:44,200
that we're objectifying humans with
these sex robots were kind of humanizing

3548
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:44,210
these sex robots were kind of humanizing
 

3549
01:07:44,210 --> 01:07:46,390
these sex robots were kind of humanizing
objects right so there's something kind

3550
01:07:46,390 --> 01:07:46,400
objects right so there's something kind
 

3551
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:48,099
objects right so there's something kind
of fascinating in our ability to do that

3552
01:07:48,099 --> 01:07:48,109
of fascinating in our ability to do that
 

3553
01:07:48,109 --> 01:07:49,210
of fascinating in our ability to do that
because a lot of us don't humanize

3554
01:07:49,210 --> 01:07:49,220
because a lot of us don't humanize
 

3555
01:07:49,220 --> 01:07:52,270
because a lot of us don't humanize
humans so it's just a weird little place

3556
01:07:52,270 --> 01:07:52,280
humans so it's just a weird little place
 

3557
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:53,830
humans so it's just a weird little place
to play in and I think a lot of people I

3558
01:07:53,830 --> 01:07:53,840
to play in and I think a lot of people I
 

3559
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:56,050
to play in and I think a lot of people I
mean a lot of people will be marrying

3560
01:07:56,050 --> 01:07:56,060
mean a lot of people will be marrying
