surprised that we haven't destroyed

that's a good example of an explanation

that's a good example of an explanation
 

241
00:03:58,799 --> 00:03:59,509
that's a good example of an explanation
that perhaps

that perhaps
 

243
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,470
that perhaps
allows us to ask better questions but it

00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:02,480
allows us to ask better questions but it
 

245
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,429
allows us to ask better questions but it
seems to have

00:04:03,429 --> 00:04:03,439
seems to have
 

247
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,869
seems to have
actually described the reality of why we

00:04:06,869 --> 00:04:06,879
actually described the reality of why we

i think we will destroy each other with

00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:18,880
i think we will destroy each other with
 

259
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,830
i think we will destroy each other with
those weapons

those weapons
 

261
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,550
those weapons
eventually eventually look it's a very

262
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:22,560
eventually eventually look it's a very

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,150
eventually eventually look it's a very

low probability event
 

265
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,150
low probability event
so i'm not surprised it hasn't happened

266
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:26,160
so i'm not surprised it hasn't happened
 

267
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,909
so i'm not surprised it hasn't happened
yet i'm a little surprised it came as

00:04:27,909 --> 00:04:27,919
yet i'm a little surprised it came as
 

269
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:29,270
yet i'm a little surprised it came as
close as it did

270
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:29,280
close as it did
 

271
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,510

we got very lucky on that one but if you

280
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:38,400
we got very lucky on that one but if you
 

281
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,230
we got very lucky on that one but if you
just keep on running the clock on a low

it's asking for

it's asking for

00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,790
it's asking for

so another way to consider is uh
 

331
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,990
so another way to consider is uh
repeated games

repeated games
 

333
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,590

iterative games so is there something

334
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:31,600
iterative games so is there something
 

335
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,070

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,869
selects against pure evil
because you need to build alliances so

504
00:08:18,869 --> 00:08:18,879
because you need to build alliances so
 

505
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,629
because you need to build alliances so
bureaucracy in that regard is great

506
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:20,639
bureaucracy in that regard is great
 

507
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:21,749
bureaucracy in that regard is great
right it keeps out

508
00:08:21,749 --> 00:08:21,759
right it keeps out
 

509
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,990
right it keeps out
the worst apples but look put it this

510
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:24,000
the worst apples but look put it this
 

511
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,790
the worst apples but look put it this
way could you imagine 35 years from now

512
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:26,800
way could you imagine 35 years from now
 

513
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,830
way could you imagine 35 years from now
the osama bin laden of the future has

514
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:29,840
the osama bin laden of the future has
 

515
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,389
the osama bin laden of the future has
nukes or very bad bio weapons

516
00:08:32,389 --> 00:08:32,399
nukes or very bad bio weapons
 

517
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,630
nukes or very bad bio weapons
it seems to me you can yeah and osama

518
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:34,640
it seems to me you can yeah and osama
 

519
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,909
it seems to me you can yeah and osama
was pretty evil

520
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:35,919
was pretty evil
 

521
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,870
was pretty evil
and actually even he failed right but

522
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:38,880
and actually even he failed right but
 

523
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,990
and actually even he failed right but
nonetheless

524
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:40,000
nonetheless
 

525
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,350
nonetheless
that's what the seven or eight hundred

526
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:41,360
that's what the seven or eight hundred
 

527
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,589
that's what the seven or eight hundred
years is there for and there might be

528
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:43,599
years is there for and there might be
 

529
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,590
years is there for and there might be
destructive technologies that don't have

530
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:45,600
destructive technologies that don't have
 

531
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,030
destructive technologies that don't have
such a high

532
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:47,040
such a high
 

533
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,509
such a high
cost of production or such a high

534
00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:49,519
cost of production or such a high
 

535
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:50,550
cost of production or such a high
learning curve

536
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:50,560
learning curve
 

537
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,949
learning curve
like cyber attacks or artificial

538
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:52,959
like cyber attacks or artificial
 

539
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,430
like cyber attacks or artificial
intelligence all those kinds of things

540
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:55,440
intelligence all those kinds of things
 

541
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,509
intelligence all those kinds of things
so yeah i mean let me ask you a question

542
00:08:57,509 --> 00:08:57,519
so yeah i mean let me ask you a question
 

543
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,070
so yeah i mean let me ask you a question
let's say you could as an act of will

544
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:00,080
let's say you could as an act of will
 

545
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,150
let's say you could as an act of will
by spending a million dollars obliterate

546
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:02,160
by spending a million dollars obliterate
 

547
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,430
by spending a million dollars obliterate
any city on earth

548
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:03,440
any city on earth
 

549
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,670
any city on earth
and everyone in it dies and you'll get

550
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:05,680
and everyone in it dies and you'll get
 

551
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,190
and everyone in it dies and you'll get
caught

552
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:07,200
caught
 

553
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,550
caught
and you'll be sentenced to death but you

554
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:08,560
and you'll be sentenced to death but you
 

555
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,030
and you'll be sentenced to death but you
can make it happen just by willing it

556
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,040
can make it happen just by willing it
 

557
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,269
can make it happen just by willing it
how many months does it take before that

558
00:09:13,269 --> 00:09:13,279
how many months does it take before that
 

559
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,750
how many months does it take before that
happens

560
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:15,760

 

561
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,829

so the obvious answer is like very soon

562
00:09:17,829 --> 00:09:17,839
so the obvious answer is like very soon
 

563
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,269
so the obvious answer is like very soon
this is probably a good answer for that

564
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:19,279
this is probably a good answer for that
 

565
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:19,829
this is probably a good answer for that
because you can

566
00:09:19,829 --> 00:09:19,839
because you can
 

567
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,269
because you can
consider how many millionaires there are

568
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:21,279
consider how many millionaires there are
 

569
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,630
consider how many millionaires there are
how many you could look at that right

570
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:22,640
how many you could look at that right
 

571
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,509
how many you could look at that right
right

572
00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:23,519
right
 

573
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,470
right
i have a sense that there's just people

574
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:26,480
i have a sense that there's just people
 

575
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:26,949
i have a sense that there's just people
that

576
00:09:26,949 --> 00:09:26,959
that
 

577
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,990
that
have a million dollars

578
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:30,000
have a million dollars
 

579
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,990
have a million dollars
i mean there's a certain amount but have

580
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:32,000
i mean there's a certain amount but have
 

581
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,590
i mean there's a certain amount but have
a million dollars

582
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:33,600
a million dollars
 

583
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,590
a million dollars
have other interests that will outweigh

584
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:37,600
have other interests that will outweigh
 

585
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,310
have other interests that will outweigh
the uh the interest of destroying the

586
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:40,320
the uh the interest of destroying the
 

587
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,910
the uh the interest of destroying the
entire city

588
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:41,920
entire city
 

589
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,230
entire city
like there's a particular you know like

590
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:44,240
like there's a particular you know like
 

591
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,030
like there's a particular you know like
the

592
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:45,040
the
 

593
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,949
the
i mean maybe that's a hope it's why we

594
00:09:46,949 --> 00:09:46,959
i mean maybe that's a hope it's why we
 

595
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:51,190
i mean maybe that's a hope it's why we
should be nice to the wealthy too right

596
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:51,200
should be nice to the wealthy too right
 

597
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,190
should be nice to the wealthy too right
yeah all that trash talking is bill

598
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:53,200
yeah all that trash talking is bill
 

599
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,670
yeah all that trash talking is bill
gates we should stop that because uh

600
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:55,680
gates we should stop that because uh
 

601
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,990
gates we should stop that because uh
that doesn't inspire the other future

602
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:58,000
that doesn't inspire the other future
 

603
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,870
that doesn't inspire the other future
bill gates is to be nice to the world

604
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:00,880
bill gates is to be nice to the world
 

605
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,430
bill gates is to be nice to the world
that's true but your sense is the

606
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:03,440
that's true but your sense is the
 

607
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,190
that's true but your sense is the
cheaper it gets to destroy the world

608
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:05,200
cheaper it gets to destroy the world
 

609
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,750
cheaper it gets to destroy the world
the more likely it becomes now when i

610
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:07,760
the more likely it becomes now when i
 

611
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,430
the more likely it becomes now when i
say destroy the world there's a trick in

612
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:09,440
say destroy the world there's a trick in
 

613
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,190
say destroy the world there's a trick in
there i don't think literally every

614
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:11,200
there i don't think literally every
 

615
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,550
there i don't think literally every
human will die

616
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:12,560
human will die
 

617
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,190
human will die
but it would set back civilization by an

618
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:15,200
but it would set back civilization by an
 

619
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,949
but it would set back civilization by an
extraordinary degree it's then just

620
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:16,959
extraordinary degree it's then just
 

621
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,190
extraordinary degree it's then just
hard to predict what comes next yeah but

622
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:19,200
hard to predict what comes next yeah but
 

623
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,430
hard to predict what comes next yeah but
a catastrophe where everyone dies

624
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:21,440
a catastrophe where everyone dies
 

625
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,030
a catastrophe where everyone dies
that probably has to be something more

626
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:23,040
that probably has to be something more
 

627
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,910
that probably has to be something more
like an asteroid or a supernova

628
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:25,920
like an asteroid or a supernova
 

629
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,230
like an asteroid or a supernova
and those are purely exogenous for the

630
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:28,240
and those are purely exogenous for the
 

631
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,590
and those are purely exogenous for the
time being at least

632
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:29,600
time being at least
 

633
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,069
time being at least
so i immigrated to this country i'm i

634
00:10:32,069 --> 00:10:32,079
so i immigrated to this country i'm i
 

635

grew up in moscow russia yeah but i came
 

651
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,949
grew up in moscow russia yeah but i came
to this

652
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:48,959
to this
 

653
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,990
to this
country and this country even back there

654
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:52,000
country and this country even back there
 

655
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,310
country and this country even back there
but

656
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:52,320
but
 

657
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,550
but
it's always symbolized to me a place of

658
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:54,560
it's always symbolized to me a place of
 

659
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,750
it's always symbolized to me a place of
opportunity

660
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:55,760
opportunity
 

661
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,350
opportunity
where ev everybody could build like uh

662
00:10:59,350 --> 00:10:59,360
where ev everybody could build like uh
 

663
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,030
where ev everybody could build like uh
build the most incredible things

664
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:01,040
build the most incredible things
 

665
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,790
build the most incredible things
especially in the engineering side of

666
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:02,800
especially in the engineering side of
 

667
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,269

they're like
emergent like self-governing it

1648
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:03,840
emergent like self-governing it
 

1649
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,430
emergent like self-governing it
generates a lot of them right through

1650
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:05,440
generates a lot of them right through
 

1651
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,990
generates a lot of them right through
private norms through trade associations

1652
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:08,000
private norms through trade associations
 

1653
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,110

international trade is mostly done uh

1654
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:11,120
international trade is mostly done uh
 

1655
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,909
international trade is mostly done uh
privately and by norms so it's certainly

1656
00:27:13,909 --> 00:27:13,919
privately and by norms so it's certainly
 

1657
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:14,789
privately and by norms so it's certainly
possible

1658
00:27:14,789 --> 00:27:14,799
possible
 

1659
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,390
possible
but at the end of the day i think you

1660
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:16,400
but at the end of the day i think you
 

1661
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,830
but at the end of the day i think you
need governments to draw very clear

1662
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:18,840
need governments to draw very clear
 

1663
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,149
need governments to draw very clear
lines to prevent it from turning into

1664
00:27:22,149 --> 00:27:22,159
lines to prevent it from turning into
 

1665
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:25,110
lines to prevent it from turning into

anarchism which is like i i think
 

1677
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,830
anarchism which is like i i think
intellectually just a fascinating set of

do you think that's just the giant mess
 

1703
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,630
do you think that's just the giant mess
like do you think it's possible for an

on education all those kinds of things
 

1725
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:35,510
on education all those kinds of things
and where does it break down

1726
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:35,520
and where does it break down
 

1727
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,110
and where does it break down
well i wouldn't press a button to say

1728
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:37,120
well i wouldn't press a button to say
 

1729
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,029
well i wouldn't press a button to say
get rid of our current constitution

1730
00:28:39,029 --> 00:28:39,039
get rid of our current constitution
 

1731
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:40,389
get rid of our current constitution
which i view is pretty good

1732
00:28:40,389 --> 00:28:40,399
which i view is pretty good
 

1733
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:42,630
which i view is pretty good
and quite wise but i think the deeper

1734
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:42,640
and quite wise but i think the deeper
 

1735
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,750
and quite wise but i think the deeper
point is that

1736
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:43,760
point is that
 

1737
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,750
point is that
all societies are in some regards

1738
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:45,760
all societies are in some regards
 

1739
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,789
all societies are in some regards
anarchistic

1740
00:28:46,789 --> 00:28:46,799
anarchistic
 

1741
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,389
anarchistic
yes and we should take the anarchists

1742
00:28:48,389 --> 00:28:48,399
yes and we should take the anarchists
 

1743
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:50,310
yes and we should take the anarchists
seriously so globally there's a kind of

1744
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:50,320
seriously so globally there's a kind of
 

1745
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,230
seriously so globally there's a kind of
anarchy

1746
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:52,240
anarchy
 

1747
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,789
anarchy
across borders even within federalistic

1748
00:28:54,789 --> 00:28:54,799
across borders even within federalistic
 

1749
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:55,590
across borders even within federalistic
systems

1750
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:55,600
systems
 

1751
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,750
systems
they're typically complex there's not a

they're typically complex there's not a

so you want a good anarchy rather than a

1766
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:12,080
so you want a good anarchy rather than a
 

1767
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:12,870
so you want a good anarchy rather than a
bad anarchy

1768
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:12,880
bad anarchy
 

1769
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,549
bad anarchy
you want to squish your anarchy into the

1770
00:29:14,549 --> 00:29:14,559
you want to squish your anarchy into the
 

1771
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,630
you want to squish your anarchy into the
right corners and i don't think there's

1772
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:16,640
right corners and i don't think there's
 

1773
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,909
right corners and i don't think there's
a theoretical

00:29:17,909 --> 00:29:17,919
a theoretical
 

1775
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:20,070
a theoretical
answer how to do it but you start with a

1776
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:20,080
answer how to do it but you start with a
 

1777
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,750
answer how to do it but you start with a
country like is it working

1778
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:21,760
country like is it working
 

1779
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,470
country like is it working
well enough now this country you'd say

1780
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:24,480
well enough now this country you'd say
 

1781
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,510
well enough now this country you'd say
mostly

1782
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:25,520
mostly
 

1783
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,029
mostly
you'd certainly want to make a lot of

1784
00:29:27,029 --> 00:29:27,039
you'd certainly want to make a lot of
 

1785
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:29,029
you'd certainly want to make a lot of
improvements and that's why i don't want

1786
00:29:29,029 --> 00:29:29,039
improvements and that's why i don't want
 

1787
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:30,070
improvements and that's why i don't want
to press that get rid of the

00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:30,080
to press that get rid of the
 

1789
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,510
to press that get rid of the
constitution button

1790

constitution button
 

1791
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,269
constitution button
but to just dump on the anarchists is to

1792
00:29:33,269 --> 00:29:33,279
but to just dump on the anarchists is to
 

1793
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,350
but to just dump on the anarchists is to
miss the point always try to learn

the poetry of
 

1803
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,430
the poetry of
saying that we should squish our anarchy

00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:57,990
their ancestors at some point
probably have shared this thing

2778
00:45:57,990 --> 00:45:58,000

 

2779
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,150

right us is not going to split up it may

00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:00,160
right us is not going to split up it may
 

2781
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,150
right us is not going to split up it may
get more screwed up as a country

2782
00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:02,160
get more screwed up as a country
 

2783
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,910
get more screwed up as a country
but texas and california are not going

2784
00:46:03,910 --> 00:46:03,920
but texas and california are not going
 

2785
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,990
but texas and california are not going
to break off yeah i mean they're big

2786
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:06,000
to break off yeah i mean they're big
 

2787
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,349
to break off yeah i mean they're big
enough where they could do it but it's

2788
00:46:07,349 --> 00:46:07,359
enough where they could do it but it's
 

2789
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:08,790
enough where they could do it but it's
just never going to happen

2790
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:08,800
just never going to happen
 

2791

do you think uh uh economic growth will

2816
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:34,560
do you think uh uh economic growth will
 

2817
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:35,670
do you think uh uh economic growth will
continue indefinitely

those computational abilities
so i'm much more optimistic than say the

00:47:30,309 --> 00:47:30,319
so i'm much more optimistic than say the

not very long ago but the question is
 

2917
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,750
not very long ago but the question is
how much does that work enable

how much does that work enable
 

2919

and the most optimistic answer was in
 

2977
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:16,630
and the most optimistic answer was in
four years

2978

four years
 

2979
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:19,750

00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:12,470
starting what 1999 2000 has really quite
a few years

3264
00:54:12,470 --> 00:54:12,480
a few years
 

3265
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:15,589
a few years
of super excellent growth and putin is

00:54:15,589 --> 00:54:15,599
of super excellent growth and putin is
 

3267
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:16,150
of super excellent growth and putin is
still

00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:16,160
still
 

3269
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,950
still
riding on that it more or less coincides

00:54:25,270 --> 00:54:25,280
scene uh since then pretty recently
 

3277
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:27,109
scene uh since then pretty recently
they've had a bunch of years of negative

3278
00:54:27,109 --> 00:54:27,119
they've had a bunch of years of negative
 

3279
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:29,670
they've had a bunch of years of negative
four to five percent growth in a row

3280
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:29,680
four to five percent growth in a row
 

3281
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:30,150
four to five percent growth in a row
which is

3282
00:54:30,150 --> 00:54:30,160
which is
 

3283
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:33,030
which is
terrible the economy is way too

3284
00:54:33,030 --> 00:54:33,040
terrible the economy is way too
 

3285
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:34,950
terrible the economy is way too

dependent on fossil fuels
 

3287
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:37,670
dependent on fossil fuels
but the structural problem is this you

3288
00:54:37,670 --> 00:54:37,680
but the structural problem is this you
 

3289
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:39,190
but the structural problem is this you
need a concordance

3290
00:54:39,190 --> 00:54:39,200
need a concordance
 

3291
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,670
need a concordance
across economic power social power

3292
00:54:41,670 --> 00:54:41,680
across economic power social power

they don't have to be allocated

3296
00:54:44,390 --> 00:54:44,400
they don't have to be allocated
 

3297
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:45,990
they don't have to be allocated
identically but they have to be

3298
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:46,000
identically but they have to be
 

3299
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,430

under putin from almost the beginning

3304
00:54:52,150 --> 00:54:52,160
under putin from almost the beginning
 

3305
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:55,190
under putin from almost the beginning
has never been able to have that that

3306
00:54:55,190 --> 00:54:55,200
has never been able to have that that
 

3307
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,150
has never been able to have that that
ultimately

3308
00:54:56,150 --> 00:54:56,160
ultimately

00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,230
ultimately
his incentives are to steer the system

3310
00:54:58,230 --> 00:54:58,240
his incentives are to steer the system
 

3311
00:54:58,240 --> 00:54:59,910
his incentives are to steer the system
where the economic power

00:54:59,910 --> 00:54:59,920
where the economic power
 

3313
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:01,870
where the economic power
is in a small number of hands in a

00:55:01,870 --> 00:55:01,880
is in a small number of hands in a
 

3315
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:03,750
is in a small number of hands in a
non-diversified way

3316
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:03,760
non-diversified way
 

3317
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:06,069
non-diversified way
the system won't deliver sustainable

3318
00:55:06,069 --> 00:55:06,079
the system won't deliver sustainable
 

3319
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:07,670
the system won't deliver sustainable
gains and living standards

3320
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:07,680
gains and living standards
 

3321
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:10,950
gains and living standards
anymore ever the way it's set up now

3322
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:10,960
anymore ever the way it's set up now
 

3323
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,950
anymore ever the way it's set up now
that with fossil fuel prices go up

3324
00:55:12,950 --> 00:55:12,960
that with fossil fuel prices go up
 

3325
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,829
that with fossil fuel prices go up
they'll have some good years for sure

3326
00:55:15,829 --> 00:55:15,839
they'll have some good years for sure
 

3327
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:18,789
they'll have some good years for sure
and that is really quite structural what

3328
00:55:18,789 --> 00:55:18,799
and that is really quite structural what
 

3329
00:55:18,799 --> 00:55:20,150
and that is really quite structural what
has gone wrong

3330
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:20,160
has gone wrong
 

3331
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:21,829
has gone wrong
and then on top of that you can have an

3332
00:55:21,829 --> 00:55:21,839
and then on top of that you can have an
 

3333
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:24,150
and then on top of that you can have an
opinion of putin but you've got to start

3334
00:55:24,150 --> 00:55:24,160
opinion of putin but you've got to start
 

3335
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:25,589
opinion of putin but you've got to start
with those structural problems and

3336
00:55:25,589 --> 00:55:25,599
with those structural problems and
 

3337
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:27,190
with those structural problems and
that's why it's just

3338
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:27,200
that's why it's just
 

3339
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,270
that's why it's just
not going to work but he had all those

3340
00:55:29,270 --> 00:55:29,280
not going to work but he had all those
 

3341
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,630
not going to work but he had all those
good years in the beginning

3342
00:55:30,630 --> 00:55:30,640
good years in the beginning
 

3343
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:32,309
good years in the beginning
so the number of russians say who live

3344
00:55:32,309 --> 00:55:32,319
so the number of russians say who live
 

3345
00:55:32,319 --> 00:55:34,390
so the number of russians say who live
here or in russia

3346
00:55:34,390 --> 00:55:34,400
here or in russia
 

3347
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,549
here or in russia
who love putin and it's sincere they're

3348
00:55:36,549 --> 00:55:36,559
who love putin and it's sincere they're
 

3349
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:37,829
who love putin and it's sincere they're
not just afraid of being you know

3350
00:55:37,829 --> 00:55:37,839
not just afraid of being you know
 

3351
00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:39,109
not just afraid of being you know
dragged away

3352
00:55:39,109 --> 00:55:39,119
dragged away
 

3353
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:41,430
dragged away
like that's a real phenomenon uh yeah

3354
00:55:41,430 --> 00:55:41,440
like that's a real phenomenon uh yeah
 

3355
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:42,789
like that's a real phenomenon uh yeah
i'm really torn on

3356
00:55:42,789 --> 00:55:42,799
i'm really torn on
 

3357
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:45,670
i'm really torn on
you know putin's approval rating real

3358
00:55:45,670 --> 00:55:45,680
you know putin's approval rating real
 

3359
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:46,309
you know putin's approval rating real
approval

3360
00:55:46,309 --> 00:55:46,319
approval
 

3361
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:49,349
approval
rating seems to be very high and i'm

3362
00:55:49,349 --> 00:55:49,359
rating seems to be very high and i'm
 

3363
00:55:49,359 --> 00:55:53,430
rating seems to be very high and i'm
torn in whether that's has to do with uh

3364
00:55:53,430 --> 00:55:53,440
torn in whether that's has to do with uh
 

3365
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:56,150
torn in whether that's has to do with uh
the fact that there is uh control of the

3366
00:55:56,150 --> 00:55:56,160
the fact that there is uh control of the
 

3367
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:57,990
the fact that there is uh control of the
press

3368
00:55:57,990 --> 00:55:58,000
press
 

3369
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,870
press
or if it's which is the people i talk to

3370
00:56:00,870 --> 00:56:00,880
or if it's which is the people i talk to
 

3371
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:01,990
or if it's which is the people i talk to
who are in russia family

3372
00:56:01,990 --> 00:56:02,000
who are in russia family
 

3373
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,829
who are in russia family
and so on a genuine love of putin

3374
00:56:05,829 --> 00:56:05,839
and so on a genuine love of putin
 

3375
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:07,990
and so on a genuine love of putin
appreciation of what putin has done and

3376
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:08,000
appreciation of what putin has done and
 

3377
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,750
appreciation of what putin has done and
is going to do with russia

3378
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:09,760
is going to do with russia
 

3379
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,750
is going to do with russia
and a lot of that would go away if the

3380
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:11,760
and a lot of that would go away if the
 

3381
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,109
and a lot of that would go away if the
press were freer i think

3382
00:56:13,109 --> 00:56:13,119
press were freer i think
 

3383
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:16,150
press were freer i think
yes well singapore realizes this anyone

3384
00:56:16,150 --> 00:56:16,160
yes well singapore realizes this anyone
 

3385
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:17,270
yes well singapore realizes this anyone
discussed by the press

3386
00:56:17,270 --> 00:56:17,280
discussed by the press
 

3387
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:18,789
discussed by the press
no matter who they are people in

3388
00:56:18,789 --> 00:56:18,799
no matter who they are people in
 

3389
00:56:18,799 --> 00:56:20,549
no matter who they are people in
singapore have done a great job

3390
00:56:20,549 --> 00:56:20,559
singapore have done a great job
 

3391
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:23,270
singapore have done a great job
yes uh but if you're discussed by the

3392
00:56:23,270 --> 00:56:23,280
yes uh but if you're discussed by the
 

3393
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,549
yes uh but if you're discussed by the
press you don't look good

3394
00:56:24,549 --> 00:56:24,559
press you don't look good
 

3395
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:26,150
press you don't look good
tech company executives are learning

3396
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:26,160
tech company executives are learning
 

3397
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:29,430
tech company executives are learning
this right it's just like a rule

3398
00:56:29,430 --> 00:56:29,440
this right it's just like a rule
 

3399
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:31,109
this right it's just like a rule
so in that sense i think the rating is

3400
00:56:31,109 --> 00:56:31,119
so in that sense i think the rating is
 

3401
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:32,870
so in that sense i think the rating is
artificially high but i don't

3402
00:56:32,870 --> 00:56:32,880
artificially high but i don't
 

3403
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:35,910
artificially high but i don't
by any means think it's all insincere

3404
00:56:35,910 --> 00:56:35,920
by any means think it's all insincere
 

3405
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,750
by any means think it's all insincere
but that high popularity i view as

3406
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:37,760
but that high popularity i view as
 

3407
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,349
but that high popularity i view as
bearish for russia

3408
00:56:39,349 --> 00:56:39,359
bearish for russia
 

3409
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:40,950
bearish for russia
i would feel better about the country if

3410
00:56:40,950 --> 00:56:40,960
i would feel better about the country if
 

3411
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:43,030
i would feel better about the country if
people were more pissed off at him

3412
00:56:43,030 --> 00:56:43,040
people were more pissed off at him
 

3413
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:45,109
people were more pissed off at him
yeah that's right it's nice to see free

3414
00:56:45,109 --> 00:56:45,119
yeah that's right it's nice to see free
 

3415
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:46,470
yeah that's right it's nice to see free
speech even if it's

3416
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:46,480
speech even if it's
 

3417
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:49,589
speech even if it's
full of hate uh

3418
00:56:49,589 --> 00:56:49,599
full of hate uh
 

3419
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:52,150
full of hate uh
i am also troubled on the scientific

3420
00:56:52,150 --> 00:56:52,160
i am also troubled on the scientific
 

3421
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:52,710
i am also troubled on the scientific
side

3422
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:52,720

strongly ubi if it's at a high level
 

3961
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:09,990
strongly ubi if it's at a high level
will make that worse

3962
01:06:09,990 --> 01:06:10,000
will make that worse
 

3963

will make that worse
i mean say ubi or higher enough you

3964
01:06:11,670 --> 01:06:11,680
i mean say ubi or higher enough you
 

3965
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:13,750
i mean say ubi or higher enough you
could just sit at home

3966
01:06:13,750 --> 01:06:13,760
could just sit at home
 

3967

3969
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:18,470
uh people are not going to be happy they
don't actually want that yeah and we've

3970
01:06:18,470 --> 01:06:18,480
don't actually want that yeah and we've
 

3971
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:21,430
don't actually want that yeah and we've
relearned that in the pandemic

3972
01:06:21,430 --> 01:06:21,440
relearned that in the pandemic
 

3973
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:24,309
relearned that in the pandemic
yeah the flip side the hope with ubi is

3974
01:06:24,309 --> 01:06:24,319
yeah the flip side the hope with ubi is
 

3975
01:06:24,319 --> 01:06:26,150
yeah the flip side the hope with ubi is
you have a little bit more freedom

their doom but
like what would you expect the poetry

4876
01:21:20,390 --> 01:21:20,400
like what would you expect the poetry
 

4877
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:21,910
like what would you expect the poetry
that i love it okay

4878
01:21:21,910 --> 01:21:21,920
that i love it okay
 

4879
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:23,910
that i love it okay
uh but macroeconomically it's not it's

4880
01:21:23,910 --> 01:21:23,920
uh but macroeconomically it's not it's
 

4881
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:25,590
uh but macroeconomically it's not it's
not fundamental okay

4882
01:21:25,590 --> 01:21:25,600
not fundamental okay
 

4883
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:27,189
not fundamental okay
i was gonna say i hope you're right

4884
01:21:27,189 --> 01:21:27,199
i was gonna say i hope you're right
 

4885
01:21:27,199 --> 01:21:29,669
i was gonna say i hope you're right
because i'm uncomfortable with the chaos

4886
01:21:29,669 --> 01:21:29,679
because i'm uncomfortable with the chaos
 

4887
01:21:29,679 --> 01:21:33,189
because i'm uncomfortable with the chaos
of the masses that's creates but uh i

4888
01:21:33,189 --> 01:21:33,199
of the masses that's creates but uh i
 

4889
01:21:33,199 --> 01:21:35,270
of the masses that's creates but uh i
also think that chaos is somewhat real

4890
01:21:35,270 --> 01:21:35,280
also think that chaos is somewhat real
 

4891
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:38,709
also think that chaos is somewhat real
to be clear yes but it will matter

4892
01:21:38,709 --> 01:21:38,719
to be clear yes but it will matter
 

4893
01:21:38,719 --> 01:21:41,189
to be clear yes but it will matter
through other channels not through

you know gamestop or yeah amc
 

4899
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,669
you know gamestop or yeah amc
so you're seeing the real macro

4900
01:21:47,669 --> 01:21:47,679
so you're seeing the real macro
 

4901
01:21:47,679 --> 01:21:49,669
so you're seeing the real macro
phenomenon when people see a real macro

4902
01:21:49,669 --> 01:21:49,679
phenomenon when people see a real macro

they tend to make every micro story fit

4906
01:21:52,550 --> 01:21:52,560
they tend to make every micro story fit
 

4907
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:53,830
they tend to make every micro story fit
the narrative

the narrative
 

4909
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:55,590

kind of dissect the mistake i think

4918
01:22:01,910 --> 01:22:01,920
kind of dissect the mistake i think
 

4919
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:03,669
kind of dissect the mistake i think
people are making

4920
01:22:03,669 --> 01:22:03,679
people are making
 

4921
01:22:03,679 --> 01:22:06,070
people are making
oh do you do within the macro phenomena

4922
01:22:06,070 --> 01:22:06,080
oh do you do within the macro phenomena
 

4923
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:07,030
oh do you do within the macro phenomena
that are there

4924
01:22:07,030 --> 01:22:07,040
that are there

do you mean everyone's weird now the

4926
01:22:09,189 --> 01:22:09,199
do you mean everyone's weird now the
 

4927
01:22:09,199 --> 01:22:10,310
do you mean everyone's weird now the
internet

4928
01:22:10,310 --> 01:22:10,320
internet
 

4929
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:12,310
internet
either allows us to be weirder or makes

4930
01:22:12,310 --> 01:22:12,320
either allows us to be weirder or makes
 

4931
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:13,830
either allows us to be weirder or makes
us weirder i'm not sure what's the right

4932
01:22:13,830 --> 01:22:13,840
us weirder i'm not sure what's the right
 

4933
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:16,310
us weirder i'm not sure what's the right
way to put it maybe a mix of both

4934
01:22:16,310 --> 01:22:16,320
way to put it maybe a mix of both
 

4935
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:17,910
way to put it maybe a mix of both
you're probably right that it allows us

4936
01:22:17,910 --> 01:22:17,920
you're probably right that it allows us
 

4937
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:20,070
you're probably right that it allows us
to be weirder because

4938
01:22:20,070 --> 01:22:20,080
to be weirder because
 

4939
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:21,669
to be weirder because
well this is the other okay so this

4940
01:22:21,669 --> 01:22:21,679
well this is the other okay so this
 

4941
01:22:21,679 --> 01:22:23,590
well this is the other okay so this
connects our previous conversation

4942
01:22:23,590 --> 01:22:23,600
connects our previous conversation
 

4943
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:26,470
connects our previous conversation
is does america allow us to be weirder

4944
01:22:26,470 --> 01:22:26,480
is does america allow us to be weirder
 

4945
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:27,270
is does america allow us to be weirder
or does it

4946
01:22:27,270 --> 01:22:27,280
or does it
 

4947
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:29,990
or does it
uh make us weirder like say we're weird

4948
01:22:29,990 --> 01:22:30,000
uh make us weirder like say we're weird
 

4949
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,070
uh make us weirder like say we're weird
and somewhat neurotic to begin with

4950
01:22:32,070 --> 01:22:32,080
and somewhat neurotic to begin with
 

4951
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:33,910
and somewhat neurotic to begin with

i love lucy and network tv like that's

4956
01:22:37,830 --> 01:22:37,840
i love lucy and network tv like that's
 

4957
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:39,590
i love lucy and network tv like that's
going to keep us within certain bounds

4958
01:22:39,590 --> 01:22:39,600
going to keep us within certain bounds
 

4959
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:41,830
going to keep us within certain bounds
yeah in good and bad ways that's

4960
01:22:41,830 --> 01:22:41,840
yeah in good and bad ways that's
 

4961
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:43,669
yeah in good and bad ways that's
obviously totally gone

4962
01:22:43,669 --> 01:22:43,679
obviously totally gone
 

4963
01:22:43,679 --> 01:22:45,910
obviously totally gone
and the internet you can connect to not

4964
01:22:45,910 --> 01:22:45,920
and the internet you can connect to not
 

4965
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:46,870
and the internet you can connect to not
just q and on

4966
01:22:46,870 --> 01:22:46,880
just q and on
 

4967
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:48,310
just q and on
but all sorts of things many of them

4968
01:22:48,310 --> 01:22:48,320
but all sorts of things many of them
 

4969
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:51,189
but all sorts of things many of them
just fantastic right

4970
01:22:51,189 --> 01:22:51,199
just fantastic right
 

4971
01:22:51,199 --> 01:22:53,350
just fantastic right
but in good and bad ways it makes us

4972
01:22:53,350 --> 01:22:53,360
but in good and bad ways it makes us
 

4973
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:55,830
but in good and bad ways it makes us
weirder so that maybe is troubling

4974
01:22:55,830 --> 01:22:55,840
weirder so that maybe is troubling
 

4975
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:57,590
weirder so that maybe is troubling
right like if someone's worried about

4976
01:22:57,590 --> 01:22:57,600
right like if someone's worried about
 

4977
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:59,430
right like if someone's worried about
that i would at least say they should

4978
01:22:59,430 --> 01:22:59,440
that i would at least say they should
 

4979
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:01,750
that i would at least say they should
give it deep serious thought and then it

4980
01:23:01,750 --> 01:23:01,760
give it deep serious thought and then it
 

4981
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:03,350
give it deep serious thought and then it
has a whole lot of

4982
01:23:03,350 --> 01:23:03,360
has a whole lot of
 

4983
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:06,390
has a whole lot of
ebbs and flows micro realizations of the

4984
01:23:06,390 --> 01:23:06,400
ebbs and flows micro realizations of the
 

4985
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:07,350
ebbs and flows micro realizations of the
weirdness

4986
01:23:07,350 --> 01:23:07,360
weirdness
 

4987
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:10,070
weirdness
that don't actually matter so like chess

4988
01:23:10,070 --> 01:23:10,080
that don't actually matter so like chess
 

4989
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:11,990
that don't actually matter so like chess
players today they play a lot more weird

4990
01:23:11,990 --> 01:23:12,000
players today they play a lot more weird
 

4991
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,390
players today they play a lot more weird
openings than they did 20 years ago

4992
01:23:14,390 --> 01:23:14,400
openings than they did 20 years ago
 

4993
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:16,709
openings than they did 20 years ago
like it reflects the same thing because

4994
01:23:16,709 --> 01:23:16,719
like it reflects the same thing because
 

4995
01:23:16,719 --> 01:23:18,390
like it reflects the same thing because
you can research any weird opening on

4996
01:23:18,390 --> 01:23:18,400
you can research any weird opening on
 

4997
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:21,110
you can research any weird opening on
the internet but like does that matter

4998
01:23:21,110 --> 01:23:21,120
the internet but like does that matter
 

4999
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:23,350
the internet but like does that matter
probably not so a lot of the things we

5000
01:23:23,350 --> 01:23:23,360
probably not so a lot of the things we
 

5001
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:24,870
probably not so a lot of the things we
see are just like the weird chess

5002
01:23:24,870 --> 01:23:24,880
see are just like the weird chess
 

5003
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:25,830
see are just like the weird chess
openings

5004
01:23:25,830 --> 01:23:25,840
openings
 

5005
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:27,189
openings
and to figure out which are like the

5006
01:23:27,189 --> 01:23:27,199
and to figure out which are like the
 

5007
01:23:27,199 --> 01:23:28,629
and to figure out which are like the
weird chess openings and which are

5008
01:23:28,629 --> 01:23:28,639
weird chess openings and which are
 

5009
01:23:28,639 --> 01:23:30,310
weird chess openings and which are
fundamental to the new and growing

5010
01:23:30,310 --> 01:23:30,320
fundamental to the new and growing
 

5011
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:31,350
fundamental to the new and growing
weirdness

5012
01:23:31,350 --> 01:23:31,360
weirdness
 

5013
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:33,110
weirdness
like that's what a hedge fund investor

5014
01:23:33,110 --> 01:23:33,120
like that's what a hedge fund investor
 

5015
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:34,870
like that's what a hedge fund investor
type should be trying to do

5016
01:23:34,870 --> 01:23:34,880
type should be trying to do
 

5017
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:37,189
type should be trying to do
i just think no one knows yet it's like

5018
01:23:37,189 --> 01:23:37,199
i just think no one knows yet it's like
 

5019
01:23:37,199 --> 01:23:39,830
i just think no one knows yet it's like
this itself this fun weird guessing game

5020
01:23:39,830 --> 01:23:39,840
this itself this fun weird guessing game
 

5021
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:42,149
this itself this fun weird guessing game
which we're partly engaging in right now

5022
01:23:42,149 --> 01:23:42,159
which we're partly engaging in right now
 

5023
01:23:42,159 --> 01:23:43,189
which we're partly engaging in right now
exactly

5024
01:23:43,189 --> 01:23:43,199
exactly
 

5025
01:23:43,199 --> 01:23:46,310
exactly
and i mean as eric talks about uh on the

5026
01:23:46,310 --> 01:23:46,320
and i mean as eric talks about uh on the
 

5027
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:48,629
and i mean as eric talks about uh on the
science side of things i mean i said

5028
01:23:48,629 --> 01:23:48,639
science side of things i mean i said
 

5029
01:23:48,639 --> 01:23:50,709
science side of things i mean i said
uh like at mit especially in the machine

5030
01:23:50,709 --> 01:23:50,719
uh like at mit especially in the machine
 

5031
01:23:50,719 --> 01:23:52,310
uh like at mit especially in the machine
learning field

learning field
 

5033
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:54,149
learning field
there's a natural institutional

5034

01:24:37,189 --> 01:24:37,199
and mit
 

5081
01:24:37,199 --> 01:24:39,669
and mit
was once one of them yes now they're not

5082

in every area in some areas they have
become the problem

5086
01:24:42,470 --> 01:24:42,480
become the problem
 

5087
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:44,709
become the problem
yeah you chicago you wouldn't call it up

5088

yeah you chicago you wouldn't call it up
 

5089
01:24:44,719 --> 01:24:46,149
yeah you chicago you wouldn't call it up
and coming but it's still different

5090
01:24:46,149 --> 01:24:46,159
and coming but it's still different
 

5091
01:24:46,159 --> 01:24:48,550
and coming but it's still different
and that's great let's hope they managed

5092
01:24:48,550 --> 01:24:48,560
and that's great let's hope they managed
 

5093
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:50,709
and that's great let's hope they managed
to keep it that way

5094
01:24:50,709 --> 01:24:50,719
to keep it that way
 

5095
01:24:50,719 --> 01:24:53,350
to keep it that way
uh the biggest problem to me is the rank

5096
01:24:53,350 --> 01:24:53,360
uh the biggest problem to me is the rank
 

5097
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:55,110
uh the biggest problem to me is the rank
absurd conformism

5098
01:24:55,110 --> 01:24:55,120
absurd conformism
 

5099
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:57,430

junior mit
 

5107
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:04,870

01:25:08,149 --> 01:25:08,159
weirdness that like
 

5113
01:25:08,159 --> 01:25:09,830
weirdness that like
harvard is more open than those

three places and be a little closer to
 

5133
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:26,950
three places and be a little closer to
mit though you'll never touch them

5134
01:25:26,950 --> 01:25:26,960
mit though you'll never touch them
 

5135
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:28,790
mit though you'll never touch them
yeah that to me is very harmful and

5136
01:25:28,790 --> 01:25:28,800
yeah that to me is very harmful and
 

5137
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:30,229
yeah that to me is very harmful and
you'd rather they be more like

5138
01:25:30,229 --> 01:25:30,239
you'd rather they be more like
 

5139
01:25:30,239 --> 01:25:32,870
you'd rather they be more like
chicago more like caltech or the elder

5140
01:25:32,870 --> 01:25:32,880
chicago more like caltech or the elder
 

5141
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:34,390
chicago more like caltech or the elder
caltech all the more like

5142
01:25:34,390 --> 01:25:34,400
caltech all the more like
 

5143
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:37,750
caltech all the more like
pick some model be weird in it you might

5144
01:25:37,750 --> 01:25:37,760
pick some model be weird in it you might
 

5145
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:38,709
pick some model be weird in it you might
fail

5146
01:25:38,709 --> 01:25:38,719
fail
 

5147
01:25:38,719 --> 01:25:41,430
fail
that's socially better yeah but so the

5148
01:25:41,430 --> 01:25:41,440
that's socially better yeah but so the
 

5149
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:43,590
that's socially better yeah but so the
problem with mit for example

5150
01:25:43,590 --> 01:25:43,600
problem with mit for example
 

5151
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:47,270
problem with mit for example
is the mediocrity is really

5152
01:25:47,270 --> 01:25:47,280
is the mediocrity is really
 

5153
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:49,750
is the mediocrity is really
enforced on the junior faculty yeah so

how to play the role
of boring and and fitting in and on the

01:26:32,629 --> 01:26:32,639
of boring and and fitting in and on the
 

5197
01:26:32,639 --> 01:26:35,189
of boring and and fitting in and on the
side he does the weird

5198
01:26:35,189 --> 01:26:35,199
side he does the weird
 

5199
01:26:35,199 --> 01:26:36,629
side he does the weird
but they're not they're far and few in

5200
01:26:36,629 --> 01:26:36,639
but they're not they're far and few in
 

5201
01:26:36,639 --> 01:26:38,229
but they're not they're far and few in
between which i

01:26:38,229 --> 01:26:38,239
between which i
 

5203
01:26:38,239 --> 01:26:40,390
between which i
i'd i'd love to figure out a way to

5204
01:26:40,390 --> 01:26:40,400
i'd i'd love to figure out a way to
 

5205
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:42,790
i'd i'd love to figure out a way to
shake up that system because

5206
01:26:42,790 --> 01:26:42,800
shake up that system because
 

5207
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:44,790
shake up that system because
as you look at mit's broad institute

5208
01:26:44,790 --> 01:26:44,800
as you look at mit's broad institute
 

5209
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:46,310
as you look at mit's broad institute
right and biomedical it's been a huge

5210
01:26:46,310 --> 01:26:46,320
right and biomedical it's been a huge
 

5211
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:46,709
right and biomedical it's been a huge
hit

5212
01:26:46,709 --> 01:26:46,719
hit
 

5213
01:26:46,719 --> 01:26:48,550
hit
yeah i'm not privy to their internal

5214
01:26:48,550 --> 01:26:48,560
yeah i'm not privy to their internal
 

5215
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:50,149
yeah i'm not privy to their internal
doings but i suspect

5216
01:26:50,149 --> 01:26:50,159
doings but i suspect
 

5217
01:26:50,159 --> 01:26:53,270
doings but i suspect
they support weird more than the formal

5218
01:26:53,270 --> 01:26:53,280
they support weird more than the formal
 

5219
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:54,149
they support weird more than the formal
departments do

5220
01:26:54,149 --> 01:26:54,159
departments do
 

5221
01:26:54,159 --> 01:26:55,990
departments do
at the junior level yes that's probably

5222
01:26:55,990 --> 01:26:56,000
at the junior level yes that's probably
 

5223
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,990
at the junior level yes that's probably
true yeah i don't know what

5224
01:26:57,990 --> 01:26:58,000
true yeah i don't know what
 

5225
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:02,229
true yeah i don't know what
whatever they're doing is working but uh

5226
01:27:02,229 --> 01:27:02,239
whatever they're doing is working but uh
 

5227
01:27:02,239 --> 01:27:03,990
whatever they're doing is working but uh
we need to figure it out because i think

5228
01:27:03,990 --> 01:27:04,000
we need to figure it out because i think
 

5229
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:07,030
we need to figure it out because i think
the best ideas still do come from the

uh so forget uh my apologies but for the
 

5233
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:11,910
uh so forget uh my apologies but for the
humanities side of things i don't i

01:27:13,510 --> 01:27:13,520
don't know anything about but the
 

5237
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:16,070
don't know anything about but the
engineering and the science side i think

5238
01:27:16,070 --> 01:27:16,080
engineering and the science side i think
 

5239
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:17,750
engineering and the science side i think
there's so many amazing ideas that are

01:27:17,750 --> 01:27:17,760
there's so many amazing ideas that are
 

5241

diversity
 

5283
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:55,030
diversity
and the and the the the full scope of

01:27:55,030 --> 01:27:55,040
and the and the the the full scope of
 

5285
01:27:55,040 --> 01:27:56,790
and the and the the the full scope of
what diversity means and also the more

5286
01:27:56,790 --> 01:27:56,800
what diversity means and also the more
 

5287
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:58,310
what diversity means and also the more
narrow scope of different races and

5288
01:27:58,310 --> 01:27:58,320
narrow scope of different races and
 

5289
01:27:58,320 --> 01:27:59,669

out mit why don't we do
 

5311
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:22,950
out mit why don't we do
more uh why don't we kick stanford's ass

5312
01:28:22,950 --> 01:28:22,960
more uh why don't we kick stanford's ass
 

5313
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:25,350
more uh why don't we kick stanford's ass
or google's ass more importantly in deep

of what of greatness
 

5329
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:43,990
of what of greatness
in artificial intelligence let's have

5330
01:28:43,990 --> 01:28:44,000
in artificial intelligence let's have
 

5331
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:45,590
in artificial intelligence let's have
those meetings as well

5332
01:28:45,590 --> 01:28:45,600
those meetings as well

yes exactly and right so it's almost

5338
01:28:52,709 --> 01:28:52,719
yes exactly and right so it's almost
 

5339
01:28:52,719 --> 01:28:54,790
yes exactly and right so it's almost
like this conformity mechanism finds

5340
01:28:54,790 --> 01:28:54,800
like this conformity mechanism finds
 

5341
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:57,189
like this conformity mechanism finds
the hot new topic to use to enforce

5342
01:28:57,189 --> 01:28:57,199
the hot new topic to use to enforce
 

5343
01:28:57,199 --> 01:28:59,510
the hot new topic to use to enforce
further conformity exactly

5344
01:28:59,510 --> 01:28:59,520

it seems to me it's now at a threshold
 

5599

it seems to me it's now at a threshold
where one ought to take it seriously

equipment don't take it seriously it's
 

5609
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:25,030
equipment don't take it seriously it's
such a taboo topic

5610
01:33:25,030 --> 01:33:25,040
such a taboo topic
 

5611
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:27,510
such a taboo topic
that you have just like really shitty

5612
01:33:27,510 --> 01:33:27,520
that you have just like really shitty
 

5613
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:29,750

equipment collecting data

5614
01:33:29,750 --> 01:33:29,760
equipment collecting data
 

5615
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:31,590
equipment collecting data
and so you have the blurry bigfoot kind

5616
01:33:31,590 --> 01:33:31,600
and so you have the blurry bigfoot kind
 

5617
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:33,350
and so you have the blurry bigfoot kind
of situation where you have just bad

01:33:35,510 --> 01:33:35,520
video and all those kinds of things
 

5621
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:38,470
video and all those kinds of things
as opposed to uh i mean there's a bunch

5622
01:33:38,470 --> 01:33:38,480
as opposed to uh i mean there's a bunch
 

5623

like
 

5631
01:33:46,239 --> 01:33:49,510
like
people with the equipment

5632
01:33:49,510 --> 01:33:49,520
people with the equipment
 

5633
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:52,870
people with the equipment
to do the data collection don't want to

help out
 

5637
01:33:54,159 --> 01:33:57,669
help out
and that creates a kind of divide

5638
01:33:57,669 --> 01:33:57,679
and that creates a kind of divide
 

5639
01:33:57,679 --> 01:34:00,070
and that creates a kind of divide
where the scientists ignore that this is

5640
01:34:00,070 --> 01:34:00,080
where the scientists ignore that this is
 

5641
01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:01,830
where the scientists ignore that this is
happening and there's the masses of

5642
01:34:01,830 --> 01:34:01,840
happening and there's the masses of
 

5643
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:04,229
happening and there's the masses of
people who are curious about it and then

5644
01:34:04,229 --> 01:34:04,239
people who are curious about it and then
 

5645
01:34:04,239 --> 01:34:05,910
people who are curious about it and then
there's the government that's full of

5646
01:34:05,910 --> 01:34:05,920
there's the government that's full of
 

5647
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:06,870
there's the government that's full of
secrets

5648
01:34:06,870 --> 01:34:06,880
secrets
 

5649
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:10,629
secrets
that's leaking some confusion

5650
01:34:10,629 --> 01:34:10,639
that's leaking some confusion
 

5651
01:34:10,639 --> 01:34:12,149
that's leaking some confusion
and it creates distrust in the

5652
01:34:12,149 --> 01:34:12,159
and it creates distrust in the
 

5653
01:34:12,159 --> 01:34:13,910
and it creates distrust in the
government it creates distrust in

5654
01:34:13,910 --> 01:34:13,920
government it creates distrust in
 

5655
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:15,110
government it creates distrust in
science

5656
01:34:15,110 --> 01:34:15,120
science
 

5657
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:17,030
science
and it prevents the scientists from

5658
01:34:17,030 --> 01:34:17,040
and it prevents the scientists from
 

5659
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:18,629
and it prevents the scientists from
being able to explore some cool

5660
01:34:18,629 --> 01:34:18,639
being able to explore some cool
 

5661
01:34:18,639 --> 01:34:21,750
being able to explore some cool
topics some exciting possibilities that

5662
01:34:21,750 --> 01:34:21,760
topics some exciting possibilities that
 

5663
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:22,629
topics some exciting possibilities that
they should be

5664
01:34:22,629 --> 01:34:22,639
they should be
 

5665
01:34:22,639 --> 01:34:25,189
they should be
be curious kids like avi talks about

5666
01:34:25,189 --> 01:34:25,199
be curious kids like avi talks about
 

5667
01:34:25,199 --> 01:34:27,030

even if it has nothing to do with
 

5669
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:29,830
even if it has nothing to do with
aliens whatever the answer is it has to

aliens whatever the answer is it has to
 

5671
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:31,030
aliens whatever the answer is it has to
be something fascinating

5672
01:34:31,030 --> 01:34:31,040
be something fascinating
 

5673
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:32,470
be something fascinating
we already know everything's interesting

5674
01:34:32,470 --> 01:34:32,480
we already know everything's interesting
 

5675
01:34:32,480 --> 01:34:35,830
we already know everything's interesting
but this is fascinating

5676
01:34:35,830 --> 01:34:35,840

 

5677
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:37,669

but look that all said i i suspect

but look that all said i i suspect
 

5679
01:34:37,679 --> 01:34:39,189
but look that all said i i suspect
they're not of alien origin and let's

5680
01:34:39,189 --> 01:34:39,199
they're not of alien origin and let's
 

5681
01:34:39,199 --> 01:34:40,950
they're not of alien origin and let's
let me tell you my reason the people

5682
01:34:40,950 --> 01:34:40,960
let me tell you my reason the people
 

5683
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:43,990
let me tell you my reason the people
who are all gung-ho they do a kind of

5684
01:34:43,990 --> 01:34:44,000
who are all gung-ho they do a kind of
 

5685
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:45,830
who are all gung-ho they do a kind of
reasoning in reverse or argument from

5686
01:34:45,830 --> 01:34:45,840
reasoning in reverse or argument from
 

5687
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:47,669
reasoning in reverse or argument from
elimination

5688
01:34:47,669 --> 01:34:47,679
elimination
 

5689
01:34:47,679 --> 01:34:49,189
elimination
they figure out a bunch of things that

5690
01:34:49,189 --> 01:34:49,199
they figure out a bunch of things that
 

5691
01:34:49,199 --> 01:34:51,030
they figure out a bunch of things that
can't be like is it a russian advanced

5692
01:34:51,030 --> 01:34:51,040
can't be like is it a russian advanced
 

5693
01:34:51,040 --> 01:34:52,310
can't be like is it a russian advanced
vehicle

5694
01:34:52,310 --> 01:34:52,320
vehicle
 

5695
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:54,390
vehicle
no probably pretty good arguments there

5696
01:34:54,390 --> 01:34:54,400
no probably pretty good arguments there
 

5697
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:56,229
no probably pretty good arguments there
is it a chinese advanced vehicle

5698
01:34:56,229 --> 01:34:56,239
is it a chinese advanced vehicle
 

5699
01:34:56,239 --> 01:34:59,189
is it a chinese advanced vehicle
no is it people like from the earth's

5700
01:34:59,189 --> 01:34:59,199
no is it people like from the earth's
 

5701
01:34:59,199 --> 01:35:00,070
no is it people like from the earth's
future

5702
01:35:00,070 --> 01:35:00,080
future
 

5703
01:35:00,080 --> 01:35:02,629
future
coming back in time no and they go

5704
01:35:02,629 --> 01:35:02,639
coming back in time no and they go
 

5705
01:35:02,639 --> 01:35:03,830
coming back in time no and they go
through a few others they have some

5706
01:35:03,830 --> 01:35:03,840
through a few others they have some
 

5707
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:05,109
through a few others they have some
really good no arguments then they're

5708
01:35:05,109 --> 01:35:05,119
really good no arguments then they're
 

5709
01:35:05,119 --> 01:35:07,030
really good no arguments then they're
like well what we've got left is aliens

5710
01:35:07,030 --> 01:35:07,040
like well what we've got left is aliens
 

5711
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:09,750
like well what we've got left is aliens
yeah this argument from elimination i

5712
01:35:09,750 --> 01:35:09,760
yeah this argument from elimination i
 

5713
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:10,390
yeah this argument from elimination i
don't

5714
01:35:10,390 --> 01:35:10,400
don't
 

5715
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:12,629
don't
actually find that persuasive you can

5716
01:35:12,629 --> 01:35:12,639
actually find that persuasive you can
 

5717
01:35:12,639 --> 01:35:14,390
actually find that persuasive you can
talk yourself into a lot of mistaken

5718
01:35:14,390 --> 01:35:14,400
talk yourself into a lot of mistaken
 

5719
01:35:14,400 --> 01:35:15,510
talk yourself into a lot of mistaken
ideas that way

5720
01:35:15,510 --> 01:35:15,520
ideas that way
 

5721
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:17,510
ideas that way
yeah the positive evidence that it's

5722
01:35:17,510 --> 01:35:17,520
yeah the positive evidence that it's
 

5723
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:18,870
yeah the positive evidence that it's
aliens

5724
01:35:18,870 --> 01:35:18,880
aliens
 

5725
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:21,030
aliens
is still quite weak the positive

5726
01:35:21,030 --> 01:35:21,040
is still quite weak the positive
 

5727
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:22,470
is still quite weak the positive
evidence that it's a puzzle

5728
01:35:22,470 --> 01:35:22,480
evidence that it's a puzzle
 

5729
01:35:22,480 --> 01:35:25,430
evidence that it's a puzzle
is quite huge and then and uh whatever

5730
01:35:25,430 --> 01:35:25,440
is quite huge and then and uh whatever
 

5731
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:27,109
is quite huge and then and uh whatever
the solution to the puzzle is

5732
01:35:27,109 --> 01:35:27,119
the solution to the puzzle is
 

5733
01:35:27,119 --> 01:35:28,790
the solution to the puzzle is
it might be fascinating and it's going

5734
01:35:28,790 --> 01:35:28,800
it might be fascinating and it's going
 

5735
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:30,790
it might be fascinating and it's going
to be so weird or fascinating or maybe

5736
01:35:30,790 --> 01:35:30,800
to be so weird or fascinating or maybe
 

5737
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:32,550
to be so weird or fascinating or maybe
even trivial but that's weird in its own

5738
01:35:32,550 --> 01:35:32,560
even trivial but that's weird in its own
 

5739
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:33,510
even trivial but that's weird in its own
way

5740
01:35:33,510 --> 01:35:33,520
way
 

5741
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:37,109
way
that we can't set up by elimination all

5742
01:35:37,109 --> 01:35:37,119
that we can't set up by elimination all
 

5743
01:35:37,119 --> 01:35:38,629
that we can't set up by elimination all
the things that might be able to be

5744
01:35:38,629 --> 01:35:38,639
the things that might be able to be
 

5745
01:35:38,639 --> 01:35:40,229
the things that might be able to be
yeah and just like you said the

5746
01:35:40,229 --> 01:35:40,239
yeah and just like you said the
 

5747
01:35:40,239 --> 01:35:42,070
yeah and just like you said the
debunking that i've seen

5748
01:35:42,070 --> 01:35:42,080
debunking that i've seen
 

5749
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:45,669
debunking that i've seen
of these kinds of things are

5750
01:35:45,669 --> 01:35:45,679
of these kinds of things are
 

5751
01:35:45,679 --> 01:35:48,790
of these kinds of things are
less explorations and solutions to the

5752
01:35:48,790 --> 01:35:48,800
less explorations and solutions to the
 

5753
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:49,910
less explorations and solutions to the
puzzle and more

5754
01:35:49,910 --> 01:35:49,920
puzzle and more
 

5755
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:52,950
puzzle and more
a kind of half-hearted dismissal and

5756
01:35:52,950 --> 01:35:52,960
a kind of half-hearted dismissal and
 

5757
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:55,270
a kind of half-hearted dismissal and
avi as you mentioned to him on your

5758
01:35:55,270 --> 01:35:55,280
avi as you mentioned to him on your
 

5759
01:35:55,280 --> 01:35:55,990
avi as you mentioned to him on your
podcast with

5760

01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,709
podcast with
him he's been attacked an awful lot and

5762
01:35:58,709 --> 01:35:58,719
him he's been attacked an awful lot and
 

5763
01:35:58,719 --> 01:36:01,109
him he's been attacked an awful lot and
when i hear the idea carrier attacked

5764
01:36:01,109 --> 01:36:01,119
when i hear the idea carrier attacked
 

5765
01:36:01,119 --> 01:36:04,229
when i hear the idea carrier attacked
i get very suspicious of the critics

5766
01:36:04,229 --> 01:36:04,239
i get very suspicious of the critics
 

5767
01:36:04,239 --> 01:36:06,310
i get very suspicious of the critics
uh if if he's wrong like just tell me

5768
01:36:06,310 --> 01:36:06,320
uh if if he's wrong like just tell me
 

5769
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:08,790
uh if if he's wrong like just tell me
why yeah like my ears are open

5770
01:36:08,790 --> 01:36:08,800
why yeah like my ears are open
 

5771

argument is uh in the in the meeting
 

5789
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:29,189
argument is uh in the in the meeting
of that debate is when we've where we

5790
01:36:29,189 --> 01:36:29,199
of that debate is when we've where we
 

5791
01:36:29,199 --> 01:36:30,390
of that debate is when we've where we
find the wisdom

5792
01:36:30,390 --> 01:36:30,400
find the wisdom
 

5793
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:32,149
find the wisdom
like dismissing it that's one thing that

5794
01:36:32,149 --> 01:36:32,159
like dismissing it that's one thing that
 

5795
01:36:32,159 --> 01:36:33,510
like dismissing it that's one thing that
troubles me there's a bunch of people

5796
01:36:33,510 --> 01:36:33,520
troubles me there's a bunch of people
 

5797
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:34,550
troubles me there's a bunch of people
like nietzsche sometimes

like nietzsche sometimes
 

5799
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:36,470
like nietzsche sometimes
dismissed this way ayn rand is sometimes

5800
01:36:36,470 --> 01:36:36,480
dismissed this way ayn rand is sometimes
 

5801
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:39,510
dismissed this way ayn rand is sometimes
dismissed this way oh here we go like

5802
01:36:39,510 --> 01:36:39,520
dismissed this way oh here we go like
 

5803
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:41,669
dismissed this way oh here we go like
the there's a as opposed to arguing

5804
01:36:41,669 --> 01:36:41,679
the there's a as opposed to arguing
 

5805
01:36:41,679 --> 01:36:42,950
the there's a as opposed to arguing
against her ideas

5806
01:36:42,950 --> 01:36:42,960
against her ideas
 

5807
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:45,990
against her ideas
dismissing it all right and that that

5808
01:36:45,990 --> 01:36:46,000
dismissing it all right and that that
 

5809
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,470
dismissing it all right and that that
that's not productive at all uh she may

5810
01:36:48,470 --> 01:36:48,480
that's not productive at all uh she may
 

5811
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:50,310
that's not productive at all uh she may
be wrong in a lot of things but

5812
01:36:50,310 --> 01:36:50,320
be wrong in a lot of things but
 

5813
01:36:50,320 --> 01:36:53,109
be wrong in a lot of things but
like laying out some arguments even if

5814
01:36:53,109 --> 01:36:53,119
like laying out some arguments even if
 

5815
01:36:53,119 --> 01:36:55,030
like laying out some arguments even if
they're basic human arguments

5816
01:36:55,030 --> 01:36:55,040
they're basic human arguments
 

5817
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:57,350
they're basic human arguments
uh that's that's where we arrive at the

5818
01:36:57,350 --> 01:36:57,360
uh that's that's where we arrive at the
 

5819
01:36:57,360 --> 01:36:59,109
uh that's that's where we arrive at the
wisdom i love that

5820
01:36:59,109 --> 01:36:59,119
wisdom i love that
 

5821
01:36:59,119 --> 01:37:02,310
wisdom i love that
uh is there something um

5822
01:37:02,310 --> 01:37:02,320
uh is there something um
 

5823
01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:04,229
uh is there something um
deeper to be said about our trust and

5824
01:37:04,229 --> 01:37:04,239
deeper to be said about our trust and
 

5825
01:37:04,239 --> 01:37:06,629
deeper to be said about our trust and
institutions and governments and so on

5826
01:37:06,629 --> 01:37:06,639
institutions and governments and so on
 

5827
01:37:06,639 --> 01:37:09,350
institutions and governments and so on
that has to do with ufos that there

5828
01:37:09,350 --> 01:37:09,360
that has to do with ufos that there
 

5829
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:10,870
that has to do with ufos that there
there's a kind of suspicion

5830
01:37:10,870 --> 01:37:10,880
there's a kind of suspicion
 

5831
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:13,030
there's a kind of suspicion
that the us government and governments

5832
01:37:13,030 --> 01:37:13,040
that the us government and governments
 

5833
01:37:13,040 --> 01:37:14,950
that the us government and governments
in general are hiding stuff from us

5834
01:37:14,950 --> 01:37:14,960
in general are hiding stuff from us
 

5835
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:18,070
in general are hiding stuff from us
uh when you talk about ufos

5836
01:37:18,070 --> 01:37:18,080
uh when you talk about ufos
 

5837
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:19,510
uh when you talk about ufos
this is my view on that if we

5838
01:37:19,510 --> 01:37:19,520
this is my view on that if we
 

5839
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:21,270
this is my view on that if we
declassified everything

5840
01:37:21,270 --> 01:37:21,280
declassified everything
 

5841
01:37:21,280 --> 01:37:22,790
declassified everything
i think we would find a lot more

5842
01:37:22,790 --> 01:37:22,800
i think we would find a lot more
 

5843
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:24,390
i think we would find a lot more
evidence all pointing toward the same

5844
01:37:24,390 --> 01:37:24,400
evidence all pointing toward the same
 

5845
01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:25,590
evidence all pointing toward the same
puzzle

5846
01:37:25,590 --> 01:37:25,600
puzzle
 

5847
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:27,510

file that lays out whatever is happening
 

5853
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:34,790
file that lays out whatever is happening
i think the real lesson about government

5854

the surface shifting completely

5908
01:38:24,950 --> 01:38:24,960
the surface shifting completely
 

5909
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:27,030
the surface shifting completely
because it is all the same topic you

5910
01:38:27,030 --> 01:38:27,040
because it is all the same topic you
 

5911
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:29,830
because it is all the same topic you
have written and studied art

why do you think we humans um long to

5914
01:38:32,950 --> 01:38:32,960
why do you think we humans um long to
 

5915
01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:33,750
why do you think we humans um long to
create

5916
01:38:33,750 --> 01:38:33,760

5917
01:38:33,760 --> 01:38:36,229
create
art human society in general and just

5918
01:38:36,229 --> 01:38:36,239
art human society in general and just
 

5919
01:38:36,239 --> 01:38:37,830
art human society in general and just
the human mind

5920
01:38:37,830 --> 01:38:37,840
the human mind
 

5921
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:39,830
the human mind
well most of us don't really long to

5922
01:38:39,830 --> 01:38:39,840
well most of us don't really long to
 

5923
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:41,030
well most of us don't really long to
create art right

5924
01:38:41,030 --> 01:38:41,040
create art right
 

5925
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:44,070
create art right
i would start with that point you think

5926
01:38:44,070 --> 01:38:44,080
i would start with that point you think
 

5927
01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:44,870
i would start with that point you think
so

5928
01:38:44,870 --> 01:38:44,880
so
 

5929
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:46,310
so
do you think that's the create i don't

5930
01:38:46,310 --> 01:38:46,320
do you think that's the create i don't
 

5931
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:48,229
do you think that's the create i don't
know that's the unique weirdness of

5932
01:38:48,229 --> 01:38:48,239
know that's the unique weirdness of
 

5933
01:38:48,239 --> 01:38:50,550
know that's the unique weirdness of
some particular humans i think i don't

5934
01:38:50,550 --> 01:38:50,560
some particular humans i think i don't
 

5935
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:52,310
some particular humans i think i don't
know 10 percent of humans

5936
01:38:52,310 --> 01:38:52,320
know 10 percent of humans
 

5937
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:54,709
know 10 percent of humans
roughly which is a lot but it is

5938
01:38:54,709 --> 01:38:54,719
roughly which is a lot but it is
 

5939
01:38:54,719 --> 01:38:55,830
roughly which is a lot but it is
somewhat weird

5940
01:38:55,830 --> 01:38:55,840
somewhat weird
 

5941
01:38:55,840 --> 01:38:58,870
somewhat weird
yeah i don't aspire to create art you

5942
01:38:58,870 --> 01:38:58,880
yeah i don't aspire to create art you
 

5943
01:38:58,880 --> 01:38:59,990
yeah i don't aspire to create art you
could say

5944
01:38:59,990 --> 01:39:00,000
could say
 

5945
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:01,750
could say
like writing non-fiction there's

5946
01:39:01,750 --> 01:39:01,760
like writing non-fiction there's
 

5947
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:03,830
like writing non-fiction there's
something art-like about it but

5948
01:39:03,830 --> 01:39:03,840
something art-like about it but
 

5949
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:07,910
something art-like about it but
it's a different urge i would say yeah

5950
01:39:07,910 --> 01:39:07,920

 

5951
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:11,109

so why do some people have it i think

5952
01:39:11,109 --> 01:39:11,119
so why do some people have it i think
 

5953
01:39:11,119 --> 01:39:14,390
so why do some people have it i think
human brains are very different it's a

5954

different
 

5957
01:39:15,199 --> 01:39:17,109
different
notion of working through a problem like

5958
01:39:17,109 --> 01:39:17,119
notion of working through a problem like
 

5959
01:39:17,119 --> 01:39:19,350
notion of working through a problem like
you and i enjoy working through

5960
01:39:19,350 --> 01:39:19,360
you and i enjoy working through
 

5961
01:39:19,360 --> 01:39:21,830
you and i enjoy working through
analytic problems for me economics for

5962
01:39:21,830 --> 01:39:21,840
analytic problems for me economics for
 

5963
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:24,070
analytic problems for me economics for
uai in other areas or your humanities

5964
01:39:24,070 --> 01:39:24,080
uai in other areas or your humanities

podcast
 

5967
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:28,550
podcast
but that's fun yeah for that problem to

5968
01:39:28,550 --> 01:39:28,560
but that's fun yeah for that problem to
 

5969
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:29,830
but that's fun yeah for that problem to
be visual

5970
01:39:29,830 --> 01:39:29,840
be visual
 

5971
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:31,910
be visual
and linked to physical materials and

5972
01:39:31,910 --> 01:39:31,920
and linked to physical materials and
 

5973
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:34,790
and linked to physical materials and
putting those like on a canvas

5974
01:39:34,790 --> 01:39:34,800
putting those like on a canvas
 

5975
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:37,750
putting those like on a canvas
to me it's not a huge leap but i really

5976
01:39:37,750 --> 01:39:37,760
to me it's not a huge leap but i really
 

5977

so i i wonder if if there's just a
higher learning curve

6272
01:44:22,149 --> 01:44:22,159
higher learning curve
 

6273
01:44:22,159 --> 01:44:23,590
higher learning curve
a steeper learning curve for

6274
01:44:23,590 --> 01:44:23,600
a steeper learning curve for
 

6275
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:26,149

very good
but this is what i would do i would fly

6394
01:46:23,669 --> 01:46:23,679
but this is what i would do i would fly
 

6395
01:46:23,679 --> 01:46:25,270
but this is what i would do i would fly
to hermosillo

6396
01:46:25,270 --> 01:46:25,280
to hermosillo
 

6397
01:46:25,280 --> 01:46:27,990
to hermosillo
in northern mexico which has some of the

6398
01:46:27,990 --> 01:46:28,000
in northern mexico which has some of the
 

6399
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,390
in northern mexico which has some of the
best food in mexico but i sadly only had

6400
01:46:30,390 --> 01:46:30,400
best food in mexico but i sadly only had
 

6401
01:46:30,400 --> 01:46:31,830
best food in mexico but i sadly only had
two days there

6402
01:46:31,830 --> 01:46:31,840
two days there
 

6403
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:34,950
two days there
so somewhere like oaxaca puebla

6404
01:46:34,950 --> 01:46:34,960
so somewhere like oaxaca puebla
 

6405
01:46:34,960 --> 01:46:37,510
so somewhere like oaxaca puebla
i think they have food just as good or

6406
01:46:37,510 --> 01:46:37,520
i think they have food just as good or
 

6407
01:46:37,520 --> 01:46:39,030
i think they have food just as good or
some people would say better but i've

6408
01:46:39,030 --> 01:46:39,040
some people would say better but i've
 

6409
01:46:39,040 --> 01:46:39,990
some people would say better but i've
spent a lot of time

6410
01:46:39,990 --> 01:46:40,000
spent a lot of time
 

6411
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,950
spent a lot of time
in those places so the scarce wait is it

6412
01:46:42,950 --> 01:46:42,960
in those places so the scarce wait is it
 

6413
01:46:42,960 --> 01:46:44,229
in those places so the scarce wait is it
possible the scarcity of time

6414
01:46:44,229 --> 01:46:44,239
possible the scarcity of time
 

6415
01:46:44,239 --> 01:46:45,270
possible the scarcity of time
contributed to the

6416
01:46:45,270 --> 01:46:45,280
contributed to the
 

6417
01:46:45,280 --> 01:46:46,950
contributed to the
the richness of the experience of course

6418
01:46:46,950 --> 01:46:46,960
the richness of the experience of course
 

6419
01:46:46,960 --> 01:46:48,709
the richness of the experience of course
but the point is that scarcity still

6420
01:46:48,709 --> 01:46:48,719
but the point is that scarcity still
 

6421
01:46:48,719 --> 01:46:49,590
but the point is that scarcity still
holds

6422
01:46:49,590 --> 01:46:49,600
holds
 

6423
01:46:49,600 --> 01:46:51,910
holds
yeah so i want one more dose yes the

6424
01:46:51,910 --> 01:46:51,920
yeah so i want one more dose yes the
 

6425
01:46:51,920 --> 01:46:53,270
yeah so i want one more dose yes the
food from hammocio

6426
01:46:53,270 --> 01:46:53,280
food from hammocio
 

6427
01:46:53,280 --> 01:46:55,669
food from hammocio
can we describe what the food is it's

6428
01:46:55,669 --> 01:46:55,679
can we describe what the food is it's
 

6429
01:46:55,679 --> 01:46:57,270
can we describe what the food is it's
the one kind of mexican food that at

6430
01:46:57,270 --> 01:46:57,280
the one kind of mexican food that at
 

6431
01:46:57,280 --> 01:46:59,109
the one kind of mexican food that at
least nominally is just like the mexican

6432
01:46:59,109 --> 01:46:59,119
least nominally is just like the mexican
 

6433
01:46:59,119 --> 01:47:00,550
least nominally is just like the mexican
food you get in the u.s

6434
01:47:00,550 --> 01:47:00,560
food you get in the u.s
 

6435
01:47:00,560 --> 01:47:02,790
food you get in the u.s
so there are burritos there's fajitas it

6436
01:47:02,790 --> 01:47:02,800
so there are burritos there's fajitas it
 

6437
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:05,189
so there are burritos there's fajitas it
doesn't taste at all like our stuff

6438
01:47:05,189 --> 01:47:05,199
doesn't taste at all like our stuff
 

6439
01:47:05,199 --> 01:47:07,270
doesn't taste at all like our stuff
but again nominally it's the part of

6440
01:47:07,270 --> 01:47:07,280
but again nominally it's the part of
 

6441
01:47:07,280 --> 01:47:09,590
but again nominally it's the part of
mexican food that made it into the u.s

6442
01:47:09,590 --> 01:47:09,600
mexican food that made it into the u.s
 

6443
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:11,830
mexican food that made it into the u.s
was then transformed yes but it's in a

6444
01:47:11,830 --> 01:47:11,840
was then transformed yes but it's in a
 

6445
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:14,229
was then transformed yes but it's in a
way the most familiar

6446
01:47:14,229 --> 01:47:14,239
way the most familiar
 

6447
01:47:14,239 --> 01:47:15,669
way the most familiar
but for that reason it's the most

6448
01:47:15,669 --> 01:47:15,679
but for that reason it's the most
 

6449
01:47:15,679 --> 01:47:17,350
but for that reason it's the most
radical because you have to rethink

6450
01:47:17,350 --> 01:47:17,360
radical because you have to rethink
 

6451
01:47:17,360 --> 01:47:18,870
radical because you have to rethink
all these things you know and they're

6452
01:47:18,870 --> 01:47:18,880
all these things you know and they're
 

6453
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:20,950
all these things you know and they're
way better in harmony

6454
01:47:20,950 --> 01:47:20,960
way better in harmony
 

6455
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:22,629
way better in harmony
hardly any tourists go there like

it's this long-standing tradition uh

6464
01:47:31,590 --> 01:47:31,600
it's this long-standing tradition uh
 

6465
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:32,870
it's this long-standing tradition uh
dirt cheap

01:47:32,870 --> 01:47:32,880
dirt cheap
 

6467
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:34,550
dirt cheap
and the thing to do there is just sweet

6468
01:47:34,550 --> 01:47:34,560

talk a taxi driver

into first taking you seriously and then

01:47:38,709 --> 01:47:38,719
into first taking you seriously and then
 

6473
01:47:38,719 --> 01:47:40,149
into first taking you seriously and then
trusting you enough

6474
01:47:40,149 --> 01:47:40,159
trusting you enough
 

6475
01:47:40,159 --> 01:47:42,229
trusting you enough
to know that you trust him to bring you

02:06:40,079 --> 02:06:43,109
days to absorb it think about it
and know like oh well 643 years from now

7602
02:06:43,109 --> 02:06:43,119
and know like oh well 643 years from now
 

7603
02:06:43,119 --> 02:06:44,709
and know like oh well 643 years from now
that's when all the atomic weapons went

7604
02:06:44,709 --> 02:06:44,719
that's when all the atomic weapons went
 

7605
02:06:44,719 --> 02:06:45,350
that's when all the atomic weapons went
off and

7606
02:06:45,350 --> 02:06:45,360
off and
 

7607
02:06:45,360 --> 02:06:46,790
off and
here's what happened between now and

7608
02:06:46,790 --> 02:06:46,800
here's what happened between now and
 

7609
02:06:46,800 --> 02:06:51,990
here's what happened between now and
then i would feel much better dying

7610
02:06:51,990 --> 02:06:52,000

 

7611
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:53,510

because that's not how it's going to be

7612
02:06:53,510 --> 02:06:53,520
because that's not how it's going to be
 

7613
02:06:53,520 --> 02:06:55,589
because that's not how it's going to be
right that's unlikely it's almost like

7614
02:06:55,589 --> 02:06:55,599
right that's unlikely it's almost like
 

7615
02:06:55,599 --> 02:06:55,910
right that's unlikely it's almost like
the

7616
02:06:55,910 --> 02:06:55,920
the
 

7617
02:06:55,920 --> 02:06:58,149
the
hitchhiker's guide they kind of have

hitchhiker's guide they kind of have
 

7619
02:06:58,159 --> 02:06:59,669
hitchhiker's guide they kind of have
what is it they have a

7620
02:06:59,669 --> 02:06:59,679
what is it they have a
 

7621
02:06:59,679 --> 02:07:01,270
what is it they have a
one or two sentence description of the

7622
02:07:01,270 --> 02:07:01,280
one or two sentence description of the
 

7623
02:07:01,280 --> 02:07:03,510
one or two sentence description of the
human of what goes on on earth

7624
02:07:03,510 --> 02:07:03,520
human of what goes on on earth
 

7625
02:07:03,520 --> 02:07:05,030
human of what goes on on earth
it's kind of interesting to think if

7626
02:07:05,030 --> 02:07:05,040
it's kind of interesting to think if
 

7627
02:07:05,040 --> 02:07:06,229
it's kind of interesting to think if
there's a lot of intelligent

7628
02:07:06,229 --> 02:07:06,239
there's a lot of intelligent
 

7629

sentence probably too true yeah that's
 

7639
02:07:15,360 --> 02:07:17,189
sentence probably too true yeah that's
the only one i can read and understand

7640
02:07:17,189 --> 02:07:17,199
the only one i can read and understand
 

7641
02:07:17,199 --> 02:07:19,990
the only one i can read and understand
right and it may be hard to understand

7642
02:07:19,990 --> 02:07:20,000
right and it may be hard to understand
 

7643
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:21,669
right and it may be hard to understand
the human one past

7644

chaucer
which i almost can do but i actually

7654
02:07:32,870 --> 02:07:32,880
which i almost can do but i actually
 

7655
02:07:32,880 --> 02:07:34,790
which i almost can do but i actually
can't i need a translation

7656
02:07:34,790 --> 02:07:34,800
can't i need a translation
 

7657
02:07:34,800 --> 02:07:37,589

mean maybe reading will be outdated it
 

7661
02:07:39,360 --> 02:07:41,510
mean maybe reading will be outdated it
might be a very silly notion

7662
02:07:41,510 --> 02:07:41,520
might be a very silly notion
 

7663
02:07:41,520 --> 02:07:44,069
might be a very silly notion
maybe we're fundamentally like we think

7664
02:07:44,069 --> 02:07:44,079
maybe we're fundamentally like we think
 

7665
02:07:44,079 --> 02:07:46,069
maybe we're fundamentally like we think
language is fundamental to cognition but

7666
02:07:46,069 --> 02:07:46,079
language is fundamental to cognition but
 

7667
02:07:46,079 --> 02:07:47,510
language is fundamental to cognition but
it could be something visual or

7668
02:07:47,510 --> 02:07:47,520
it could be something visual or
 

7669
02:07:47,520 --> 02:07:49,030
it could be something visual or
something totally different exactly

7670
02:07:49,030 --> 02:07:49,040
something totally different exactly
 

7671
02:07:49,040 --> 02:07:51,189
something totally different exactly
we'll plug in neural ink or

7672
02:07:51,189 --> 02:07:51,199
we'll plug in neural ink or
 

7673
02:07:51,199 --> 02:07:55,030
we'll plug in neural ink or
yeah uh but in that story that wikipedia

7674
02:07:55,030 --> 02:07:55,040
yeah uh but in that story that wikipedia
 

7675
02:07:55,040 --> 02:07:55,750
yeah uh but in that story that wikipedia
article

7676
02:07:55,750 --> 02:07:55,760
article
 

7677
02:07:55,760 --> 02:07:58,629
article
do you think there'll be a section on uh

7678
02:07:58,629 --> 02:07:58,639
do you think there'll be a section on uh
 

7679
02:07:58,639 --> 02:07:59,270
do you think there'll be a section on uh
the

7680
02:07:59,270 --> 02:07:59,280
the
 

7681
02:07:59,280 --> 02:08:03,030
the
meaning of it i hope not

7682
02:08:03,030 --> 02:08:03,040
meaning of it i hope not
 

7683
02:08:03,040 --> 02:08:04,629
meaning of it i hope not
because that section we could write now

7684
02:08:04,629 --> 02:08:04,639
because that section we could write now
 

7685
02:08:04,639 --> 02:08:06,390
because that section we could write now
and it's just not going to be very good

7686
02:08:06,390 --> 02:08:06,400
and it's just not going to be very good
 

7687
02:08:06,400 --> 02:08:08,470
and it's just not going to be very good
right what would you put in the section

i think if you study different cultures
the arts travel mathematics like
