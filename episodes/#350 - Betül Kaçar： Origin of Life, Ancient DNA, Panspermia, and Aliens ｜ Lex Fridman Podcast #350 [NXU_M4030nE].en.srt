00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,790

you can study chemistry you can study

2
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:01,800
you can study chemistry you can study
 

3
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,830
you can study chemistry you can study
Physics you can study geology anywhere

4
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:03,840
Physics you can study geology anywhere
 

5
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,329
Physics you can study geology anywhere
in the universe but this is the only

6
00:00:05,329 --> 00:00:05,339
in the universe but this is the only
 

7
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:07,730
in the universe but this is the only
place you can study biology this is the

8
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:07,740
place you can study biology this is the
 

9
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,070
place you can study biology this is the
only place to be a biologist that's it

10
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:10,080
only place to be a biologist that's it
 

11
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,589
only place to be a biologist that's it
yeah so so definitely something very

12
00:00:12,589 --> 00:00:12,599
yeah so so definitely something very
 

13
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:14,390
yeah so so definitely something very
fundamental happened here and you cannot

14
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:14,400
fundamental happened here and you cannot
 

15
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,430
fundamental happened here and you cannot
take biology out of the equation if you

16
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:16,440
take biology out of the equation if you
 

17
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,870
take biology out of the equation if you
want to understand how that vast

18
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:17,880
want to understand how that vast
 

19
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,290
want to understand how that vast
chemistry space of that General

chemistry space of that General
 

21
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,890
chemistry space of that General
sequence space got narrowed down to what

sequence space got narrowed down to what
 

23
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,830
sequence space got narrowed down to what
was what is available or what is used by

selection and that's when Evolution and
 

29
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,290
selection and that's when Evolution and
biology comes into play

00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:11,630
think phytogenetic trees
could be one of the most uh romantic and

00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:29,520
biologists like visualizations they like
 

71
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,969
biologists like visualizations they like
these Graphics these diagrams and tree

72
00:01:31,969 --> 00:01:31,979
these Graphics these diagrams and tree
 

73
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:34,010
these Graphics these diagrams and tree
of life is one of them so the tree

74
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:34,020
of life is one of them so the tree
 

75
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,469
of life is one of them so the tree
starts at a common ancestor

76
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:36,479
starts at a common ancestor
 

77
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,330
starts at a common ancestor
it's actually the other way around it

78
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:38,340
it's actually the other way around it
 

79
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,550
it's actually the other way around it
starts from at the end it starts from

80
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:40,560
starts from at the end it starts from
 

81
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,190
starts from at the end it starts from
the from the branches it starts from the

82
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:43,200
the from the branches it starts from the
 

83
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,950
the from the branches it starts from the
tip of the branch actually and then if

84
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:45,960
tip of the branch actually and then if
 

85
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,770
tip of the branch actually and then if
the further depending on how what you

86
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:48,780
the further depending on how what you
 

87
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,830
the further depending on how what you
collected uh to build the tree so

88
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:51,840
collected uh to build the tree so
 

89
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,749
collected uh to build the tree so
depending on the branches depending on

90
00:01:53,749 --> 00:01:53,759
depending on the branches depending on
 

91
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,310
depending on the branches depending on
what's on the tip of the branch and I

92
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:55,320
what's on the tip of the branch and I
 

93
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,770
what's on the tip of the branch and I
will explain what I mean the root will

94
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:57,780
will explain what I mean the root will
 

95
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,569
will explain what I mean the root will
be determined by what is really sitting

96
00:01:59,569 --> 00:01:59,579
be determined by what is really sitting
 

97
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:01,490
be determined by what is really sitting
on the tip of the branch of the tree so

98
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:01,500
on the tip of the branch of the tree so
 

99
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,230
on the tip of the branch of the tree so
we could study the leaves of the tree by

100
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:03,240
we could study the leaves of the tree by
 

101
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,609
we could study the leaves of the tree by
looking at what we have today and then

102
00:02:04,609 --> 00:02:04,619
looking at what we have today and then
 

103
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:07,490
looking at what we have today and then
start to reverse engineer start to move

104
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:07,500
start to reverse engineer start to move
 

105
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,290
start to reverse engineer start to move
back in time to try to understand what

106
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:09,300
back in time to try to understand what
 

107
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,790
back in time to try to understand what
the rest of the tree what the roots of

108
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:10,800
the rest of the tree what the roots of
 

109
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,410
the rest of the tree what the roots of
the tree looks exactly so the tree

110
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:12,420
the tree looks exactly so the tree
 

111
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,510
the tree looks exactly so the tree
Itself by just taking a few steps back

112
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:14,520
Itself by just taking a few steps back
 

113
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,430
Itself by just taking a few steps back
and looking at the entire tree itself

114
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:16,440
and looking at the entire tree itself
 

115
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,130
and looking at the entire tree itself
can give you an idea about the

116
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:19,140
can give you an idea about the
 

117
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,530
can give you an idea about the
connectedness the relatedness of the

118
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:21,540
connectedness the relatedness of the
 

119
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,809
connectedness the relatedness of the
organisms or whatever again you use to

120
00:02:23,809 --> 00:02:23,819
organisms or whatever again you use to
 

121
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:25,430
organisms or whatever again you use to
create your tree there are different

122
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:25,440
create your tree there are different
 

123
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,930
create your tree there are different
ways but in this case I'm imagining

124
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:28,940
ways but in this case I'm imagining
 

125
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,869
ways but in this case I'm imagining
entire diversity of Life Today is

126
00:02:32,869 --> 00:02:32,879
entire diversity of Life Today is
 

127
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,550
entire diversity of Life Today is
sitting on the tips of the branches of

128
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:34,560
sitting on the tips of the branches of
 

129
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,390
sitting on the tips of the branches of
this tree and we

130
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:37,400
this tree and we
 

131
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,570
this tree and we
look at biologists look at the the tree

132
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:41,580
look at biologists look at the the tree
 

133
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,910
look at biologists look at the the tree
itself we like to think of it as the

134
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:43,920
itself we like to think of it as the
 

135
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,670
itself we like to think of it as the
topology of the tree to understand when

136
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:46,680
topology of the tree to understand when
 

137
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,930
topology of the tree to understand when
certain

138
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:47,940
certain
 

139
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,530
certain
organisms or their ancestry may have

140
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:50,540
organisms or their ancestry may have
 

141
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:53,210
organisms or their ancestry may have
merged over time

142
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:53,220
merged over time
 

143
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:57,050
merged over time
depending on the tools you use you might

144
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:57,060
depending on the tools you use you might
 

145
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:00,290
depending on the tools you use you might
use this tree to then reconstruct the

146
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:00,300
use this tree to then reconstruct the
 

147
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,850
use this tree to then reconstruct the
ancestors as well

148
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:01,860
ancestors as well
 

149
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,009
ancestors as well
and so what are the different ways to do

150
00:03:04,009 --> 00:03:04,019
and so what are the different ways to do
 

151
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:05,869
and so what are the different ways to do
the Reconstruction so you can do that at

152
00:03:05,869 --> 00:03:05,879
the Reconstruction so you can do that at
 

153
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:07,509
the Reconstruction so you can do that at
the gene level

154
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:07,519
the gene level
 

155
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,089
the gene level
or you could do it at the higher complex

156
00:03:11,089 --> 00:03:11,099
or you could do it at the higher complex
 

157
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:14,390
or you could do it at the higher complex
biology level right so what what in

158
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:14,400
biology level right so what what in
 

159
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,550
biology level right so what what in
which way have you approached this this

160
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:16,560
which way have you approached this this
 

161
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,649
which way have you approached this this
fascinating problem we approached it in

162
00:03:18,649 --> 00:03:18,659
fascinating problem we approached it in
 

163
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:21,290
fascinating problem we approached it in
every way we can so it's the gene could

164
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:21,300
every way we can so it's the gene could
 

165
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,229
every way we can so it's the gene could
be protein the product of the gene or

166
00:03:24,229 --> 00:03:24,239
be protein the product of the gene or
 

167
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:25,369
be protein the product of the gene or
species

168
00:03:25,369 --> 00:03:25,379
species
 

169
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:28,970
species
uh or could be even groups of species it

170
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:28,980
uh or could be even groups of species it
 

171
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,649
uh or could be even groups of species it
will depend it totally depends on what

172
00:03:30,649 --> 00:03:30,659
will depend it totally depends on what
 

173
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:32,210
will depend it totally depends on what
you want to do with your tree if you

174
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:32,220
you want to do with your tree if you
 

175
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,270
you want to do with your tree if you
want to understand a certain past events

176
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:35,280
want to understand a certain past events
 

177
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,850
want to understand a certain past events
whether an organism exchanged a certain

178
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:37,860
whether an organism exchanged a certain
 

179
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,610
whether an organism exchanged a certain
DNA with another one along the course of

180
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:40,620
DNA with another one along the course of
 

181
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,949
DNA with another one along the course of
evolution you can build your tree

182
00:03:42,949 --> 00:03:42,959
evolution you can build your tree
 

183
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,229
evolution you can build your tree
accordingly if you

184
00:03:45,229 --> 00:03:45,239
accordingly if you
 

185
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:48,050
accordingly if you
um rather use the tree to reconstruct or

186
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:48,060
um rather use the tree to reconstruct or
 

187
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,030
um rather use the tree to reconstruct or
resurrect ancient DNA which is what we

188
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:50,040
resurrect ancient DNA which is what we
 

189
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,750
resurrect ancient DNA which is what we
do then in our case for instance we do

190
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:53,760
do then in our case for instance we do
 

191
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,210
do then in our case for instance we do
both Gene protein and species because we

192
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:56,220
both Gene protein and species because we
 

193
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:59,030
both Gene protein and species because we
want to compare the tree

194
00:03:59,030 --> 00:03:59,040
want to compare the tree
 

195
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,710
want to compare the tree
that we create using these different

196
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:00,720
that we create using these different
 

197
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,330
that we create using these different
information

198
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:02,340
information
 

199
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,250
information
okay well let me ask you the ridiculous

200
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:04,260
okay well let me ask you the ridiculous
 

201
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,229
okay well let me ask you the ridiculous
question then so how realistic is

202
00:04:06,229 --> 00:04:06,239
question then so how realistic is
 

203
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,149
question then so how realistic is
Jurassic Park

204
00:04:08,149 --> 00:04:08,159
Jurassic Park
 

205
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,190
Jurassic Park
can we study the genes of ancient

206
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:10,200
can we study the genes of ancient
 

207
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,770
can we study the genes of ancient
organisms and can we bring the those

208
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:12,780
organisms and can we bring the those
 

209
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,289
organisms and can we bring the those
ancient organisms back so the reason I

210
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:15,299
ancient organisms back so the reason I
 

211
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:17,330
ancient organisms back so the reason I
asked that kind of ridiculous sounding

212
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:17,340
asked that kind of ridiculous sounding
 

213
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,090
asked that kind of ridiculous sounding
question is uh maybe gives us context of

214
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:20,100
question is uh maybe gives us context of
 

215
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,430
question is uh maybe gives us context of
what we can and can't do Yeah by looking

216
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:22,440
what we can and can't do Yeah by looking
 

217
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,090
what we can and can't do Yeah by looking
back in time yeah so uh dinosaurs or all

218
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:26,100
back in time yeah so uh dinosaurs or all
 

219
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,810
back in time yeah so uh dinosaurs or all
these mammals in in at least for us is

220
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:29,820
these mammals in in at least for us is
 

221
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,629
these mammals in in at least for us is
the exciting thing already happened by

222
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:32,639
the exciting thing already happened by
 

223
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,330
the exciting thing already happened by
the time we hit to the larger organisms

224
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:35,340
the time we hit to the larger organisms
 

225
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,670
the time we hit to the larger organisms
or to eukaryotes oh to you the fun stuff

226
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:37,680
or to eukaryotes oh to you the fun stuff
 

227
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,469
or to eukaryotes oh to you the fun stuff
is before we got to the memo the fun

228
00:04:39,469 --> 00:04:39,479
is before we got to the memo the fun
 

229
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,450
is before we got to the memo the fun
stuff is what what thing is boring I

230
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:41,460
stuff is what what thing is boring I
 

231
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:44,090
stuff is what what thing is boring I
think that the the phase that's well at

232
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:44,100
think that the the phase that's well at
 

233
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,650
think that the the phase that's well at
least two different times in the

234
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:45,660
least two different times in the
 

235
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,710
least two different times in the
geologic history one is the first life

236
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:48,720
geologic history one is the first life
 

237
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,070
geologic history one is the first life
uh past origin of Life how did first

238
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:52,080
uh past origin of Life how did first
 

239
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,450
uh past origin of Life how did first
life look like

240
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:53,460
life look like
 

241
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,810
life look like
and the second is why do we think that

242
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:56,820
and the second is why do we think that
 

243
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:00,950
and the second is why do we think that
over certain periods of geologic time no

244
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:00,960
over certain periods of geologic time no
 

245
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,110
over certain periods of geologic time no
significant Innovation happened to the

246
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:03,120
significant Innovation happened to the
 

247
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,510
significant Innovation happened to the
degree of leaving no record behind

248
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:05,520
degree of leaving no record behind
 

249
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,450
degree of leaving no record behind
so what do we not have a record of which

250
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:08,460
so what do we not have a record of which
 

251
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,790
so what do we not have a record of which
which part is it you the fun stuff to

252
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:10,800
which part is it you the fun stuff to
 

253
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,370
which part is it you the fun stuff to
you is after the origin of Life which

254
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:13,380
you is after the origin of Life which
 

255
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,170
you is after the origin of Life which
we'll talk about after the original life

256
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:15,180
we'll talk about after the original life
 

257
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,390
we'll talk about after the original life
there's single cell organisms the the

258
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:17,400
there's single cell organisms the the
 

259
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,189
there's single cell organisms the the
whole thing with the photosynthesis the

260
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:19,199
whole thing with the photosynthesis the
 

261
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,409
whole thing with the photosynthesis the
whole thing with the eukaryotes and uh

262
00:05:21,409 --> 00:05:21,419
whole thing with the eukaryotes and uh
 

263
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:24,650
whole thing with the eukaryotes and uh
multi-cell organisms and uh what else is

264
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:24,660
multi-cell organisms and uh what else is
 

265
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,529
multi-cell organisms and uh what else is
the fun stuff the whole oxygen thing

266
00:05:26,529 --> 00:05:26,539
the fun stuff the whole oxygen thing
 

267
00:05:26,539 --> 00:05:29,450
the fun stuff the whole oxygen thing
which mixes in with the origin of Life

268
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:29,460
which mixes in with the origin of Life
 

269
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,129
which mixes in with the origin of Life
uh there's a bunch of different

270
00:05:31,129 --> 00:05:31,139
uh there's a bunch of different
 

271
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:32,870
uh there's a bunch of different
inventions all that have to do with this

272
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:32,880
inventions all that have to do with this
 

273
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,990
inventions all that have to do with this
primitive kind of looking organisms that

274
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:36,000
primitive kind of looking organisms that
 

275
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,930
primitive kind of looking organisms that
we don't have a good record of so I will

276
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:38,940
we don't have a good record of so I will
 

277
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,150
we don't have a good record of so I will
tell you the more interesting things for

278
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:41,160
tell you the more interesting things for
 

279
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,210
tell you the more interesting things for
us one is the origin of life or what

280
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:44,220
us one is the origin of life or what
 

281
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,029
us one is the origin of life or what
happened uh right following the

282
00:05:47,029 --> 00:05:47,039
happened uh right following the
 

283
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,710
happened uh right following the
emergence of Life how did the first

284
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:48,720
emergence of Life how did the first
 

285
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,210
emergence of Life how did the first
cells look like

286
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:50,220
cells look like
 

287
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:53,810
cells look like
and then pretty much anything that we

288
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:53,820
and then pretty much anything that we
 

289
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:57,110
and then pretty much anything that we
think shaped the environments and were

290
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:57,120
think shaped the environments and were
 

291
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,270
think shaped the environments and were
was shaped by the environments in a way

292
00:05:59,270 --> 00:05:59,280
was shaped by the environments in a way
 

293
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,969
was shaped by the environments in a way
that impacted the entire planet that

294
00:06:01,969 --> 00:06:01,979
that impacted the entire planet that
 

295
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:03,230
that impacted the entire planet that
enabled you and I to have this

296
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:03,240
enabled you and I to have this
 

297
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,310
enabled you and I to have this
conversation

298
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:04,320
conversation
 

299
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,070
conversation
we have very little understanding of the

300
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:07,080
we have very little understanding of the
 

301
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,230
we have very little understanding of the
biological innovations that took place

302
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:09,240
biological innovations that took place
 

303
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,409
biological innovations that took place
in the past of this planet

304
00:06:11,409 --> 00:06:11,419
in the past of this planet
 

305
00:06:11,419 --> 00:06:16,249
in the past of this planet
we work with a very limited set of

306
00:06:16,249 --> 00:06:16,259
we work with a very limited set of
 

307
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:17,990
we work with a very limited set of
um I don't want to even say data because

308
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:18,000
um I don't want to even say data because
 

309
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,210
um I don't want to even say data because
they're fossil records so let's say

310
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:20,220
they're fossil records so let's say
 

311
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:23,270
they're fossil records so let's say
imprints either that comes from the Rock

312
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:23,280
imprints either that comes from the Rock
 

313
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,450
imprints either that comes from the Rock
and The Rock record itself

314
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:25,460
and The Rock record itself
 

315
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:29,210
and The Rock record itself
or what I just described these trees

316
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:29,220
or what I just described these trees
 

317
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,790
or what I just described these trees
that we create and whatever we can infer

318
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:31,800
that we create and whatever we can infer
 

319
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,370
that we create and whatever we can infer
about the past so we have two distinct

320
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:34,380
about the past so we have two distinct
 

321
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:37,730
about the past so we have two distinct
ways that comes from geology and biology

322
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:37,740
ways that comes from geology and biology
 

323
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,430
ways that comes from geology and biology
and they each have their limitations

324
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:40,440
and they each have their limitations
 

325
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,370
and they each have their limitations
okay so right so there's an interplay

326
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:43,380
okay so right so there's an interplay
 

327
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,950
okay so right so there's an interplay
the geology gives you that little bit of

328
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:45,960
the geology gives you that little bit of
 

329
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,090
the geology gives you that little bit of
data

330
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:47,100
data
 

331
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:51,529
data
and then the biology gives you that

332
00:06:51,529 --> 00:06:51,539
and then the biology gives you that
 

333
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:53,330
and then the biology gives you that
little bit of kind of constraints in the

334
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:53,340
little bit of kind of constraints in the
 

335
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,010
little bit of kind of constraints in the
materials you get to work with to infer

336
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:55,020
materials you get to work with to infer
 

337
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,830
materials you get to work with to infer
how does this result in the kind of data

338
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:57,840
how does this result in the kind of data
 

339
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,330
how does this result in the kind of data
that we're seeing and now we can have

340
00:06:59,330 --> 00:06:59,340
that we're seeing and now we can have
 

341
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:02,689
that we're seeing and now we can have
this through the fog we can see we can

342
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:02,699
this through the fog we can see we can
 

343
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:04,330
this through the fog we can see we can
look back hundreds of millions of years

344
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:04,340
look back hundreds of millions of years
 

345
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,010
look back hundreds of millions of years
a couple of billion years and try to

346
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:07,020
a couple of billion years and try to
 

347
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,469
a couple of billion years and try to
infer even further and and I like that

348
00:07:09,469 --> 00:07:09,479
infer even further and and I like that
 

349
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:11,870
infer even further and and I like that
you said [\h__\h] it is pretty foggy but

350
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:11,880
you said [\h__\h] it is pretty foggy but
 

351
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,909
you said [\h__\h] it is pretty foggy but
weird and it gets foggier and foggier

352
00:07:13,909 --> 00:07:13,919
weird and it gets foggier and foggier
 

353
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,550
weird and it gets foggier and foggier
the more you the further you try to see

354
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:16,560
the more you the further you try to see
 

355
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,469
the more you the further you try to see
into the past

356
00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:18,479
into the past
 

357
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,290
into the past
um biology is you you basically study

358
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:21,300
um biology is you you basically study
 

359
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,510
um biology is you you basically study
with study the survivors

360
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:23,520
with study the survivors
 

361
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,670
with study the survivors
broadly speaking yeah and you're trying

362
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:25,680
broadly speaking yeah and you're trying
 

363
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,070
broadly speaking yeah and you're trying
to pitch the sort of put together their

364
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,080
to pitch the sort of put together their
 

365
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,510
to pitch the sort of put together their
history based on whatever you can

366
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:29,520
history based on whatever you can
 

367
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,550
history based on whatever you can
recover today what makes biology

368
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:31,560
recover today what makes biology
 

369
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,409
recover today what makes biology
fascinating also let it

370
00:07:35,409 --> 00:07:35,419
fascinating also let it
 

371
00:07:35,419 --> 00:07:38,510
fascinating also let it
erased its own history in a way right so

372
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:38,520
erased its own history in a way right so
 

373
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,070
erased its own history in a way right so
you work with this four billion year

374
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:40,080
you work with this four billion year
 

375
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,890
you work with this four billion year
product that's genome that's the DNA

376
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:42,900
product that's genome that's the DNA
 

377
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,650
product that's genome that's the DNA
it's great it's a very Dynamic ever

378
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:45,660
it's great it's a very Dynamic ever
 

379
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:49,790
it's great it's a very Dynamic ever
evolving chemical thing and so you will

380
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:49,800
evolving chemical thing and so you will
 

381
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,890
evolving chemical thing and so you will
get some information but you're not

382
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:51,900
get some information but you're not
 

383
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:52,909
get some information but you're not
gonna get

384
00:07:52,909 --> 00:07:52,919
gonna get
 

385
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:56,809
gonna get
much unless you know where to look

386
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:56,819
much unless you know where to look
 

387
00:07:56,819 --> 00:07:59,150
much unless you know where to look
um because it is responding to the

388
00:07:59,150 --> 00:07:59,160
um because it is responding to the
 

389
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,469
um because it is responding to the
environment

390
00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:00,479
environment
 

391
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,230
environment
yeah so what we have it's fascinating

392
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:03,240
yeah so what we have it's fascinating
 

393
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,110
yeah so what we have it's fascinating
what we have is the survivors the

394
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:06,120
what we have is the survivors the
 

395
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,670
what we have is the survivors the
successful

396
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:07,680
successful
 

397
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,650
successful
the successful organisms even the

398
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:09,660
the successful organisms even the
 

399
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,270
the successful organisms even the
Primitive ones even though the bacteria

400
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:11,280
Primitive ones even though the bacteria
 

401
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,570
Primitive ones even though the bacteria
you have today so bacteria is not

402
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:14,580
you have today so bacteria is not
 

403
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:17,270
you have today so bacteria is not
uh sorry sorry to offend the bacteria

404
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:17,280
uh sorry sorry to offend the bacteria
 

405
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,249
uh sorry sorry to offend the bacteria
it's we should be very grateful to

406
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:19,259
it's we should be very grateful to
 

407
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:21,189
it's we should be very grateful to
bacteria and first of all they are our

408
00:08:21,189 --> 00:08:21,199
bacteria and first of all they are our
 

409
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,409
bacteria and first of all they are our
great great ancestors I like this quote

410
00:08:24,409 --> 00:08:24,419
great great ancestors I like this quote
 

411
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:27,409
great great ancestors I like this quote
by Douglas Adams humans don't like their

412
00:08:27,409 --> 00:08:27,419
by Douglas Adams humans don't like their
 

413
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:29,510
by Douglas Adams humans don't like their
ancestors they rarely invite them over

414
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:29,520
ancestors they rarely invite them over
 

415
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,570
ancestors they rarely invite them over
for dinner yeah right that bacteria is

416
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:32,580
for dinner yeah right that bacteria is
 

417
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,310
for dinner yeah right that bacteria is
in your dinner bacteria is in your gut

418
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:34,320
in your dinner bacteria is in your gut
 

419
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,829
in your dinner bacteria is in your gut
but today is helping you for dinner we

420
00:08:36,829 --> 00:08:36,839
but today is helping you for dinner we
 

421
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:38,870
but today is helping you for dinner we
might well they get themselves invited

422
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:38,880
might well they get themselves invited
 

423
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,930
might well they get themselves invited
in a way yes and so we and they're

424
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:41,940
in a way yes and so we and they're
 

425
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,149
in a way yes and so we and they're
definitely older

426
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:44,159
definitely older
 

427
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,850
definitely older
um and and definitely very sophisticated

428
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:46,860
um and and definitely very sophisticated
 

429
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,030
um and and definitely very sophisticated
very resilient than anything

430
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:50,040
very resilient than anything
 

431
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,850
very resilient than anything
um else is someone working at the as a

432
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:52,860
um else is someone working at the as a
 

433
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,150
um else is someone working at the as a
bacteriologist I feel like I need to

434
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:55,160
bacteriologist I feel like I need to
 

435
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,350
bacteriologist I feel like I need to
defend them in this case because they

436
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:57,360
defend them in this case because they
 

437
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,210
defend them in this case because they
don't get much shout out when we think

438
00:08:59,210 --> 00:08:59,220
don't get much shout out when we think
 

439
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,130
don't get much shout out when we think
about life so you do study bacteria so

440
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:01,140
about life so you do study bacteria so
 

441
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,290
about life so you do study bacteria so
which organisms gives you hints that are

442
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:03,300
which organisms gives you hints that are
 

443
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,509
which organisms gives you hints that are
alive today that give you

444
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:05,519
alive today that give you
 

445
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,449
alive today that give you
um hints about what ancient organisms

446
00:09:08,449 --> 00:09:08,459
um hints about what ancient organisms
 

447
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:10,550
um hints about what ancient organisms
were like is it bacterias and viruses

448
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:10,560
were like is it bacterias and viruses
 

449
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,370
were like is it bacterias and viruses
what do you study in the lab we study a

450
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:13,380
what do you study in the lab we study a
 

451
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,170
what do you study in the lab we study a
variety of different bacteria depending

452
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:15,180
variety of different bacteria depending
 

453
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,030
variety of different bacteria depending
on the questions that we are

454
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:17,040
on the questions that we are
 

455
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,329
on the questions that we are
engineer bacteria so ideally we want to

456
00:09:20,329 --> 00:09:20,339
engineer bacteria so ideally we want to
 

457
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:22,930
engineer bacteria so ideally we want to
work with bacteria that we can engineer

458
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:22,940
work with bacteria that we can engineer
 

459
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:25,430
work with bacteria that we can engineer
seldom we developed the tools to

460
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:25,440
seldom we developed the tools to
 

461
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,269
seldom we developed the tools to
engineer them and it depends on the

462
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:29,279
engineer them and it depends on the
 

463
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,550
engineer them and it depends on the
question that we are interested in if we

464
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:31,560
question that we are interested in if we
 

465
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,230
question that we are interested in if we
are interested in connecting the biology

466
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:33,240
are interested in connecting the biology
 

467
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,530
are interested in connecting the biology
and geology to understand the early life

468
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:36,540
and geology to understand the early life
 

469
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:39,410
and geology to understand the early life
and and fundamental Innovations across

470
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:39,420
and and fundamental Innovations across
 

471
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,449
and and fundamental Innovations across
billions of years there are really good

472
00:09:41,449 --> 00:09:41,459
billions of years there are really good
 

473
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:44,630
billions of years there are really good
candidates like cyanobacteria so we we

474
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:44,640
candidates like cyanobacteria so we we
 

475
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,170
candidates like cyanobacteria so we we
use cyanobacteria very frequently in the

476
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:48,180
use cyanobacteria very frequently in the
 

477
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,690
use cyanobacteria very frequently in the
lab we can engineer its genome we can

478
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:50,700
lab we can engineer its genome we can
 

479
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:54,050
lab we can engineer its genome we can
perdurp its function by poking its own

480
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:54,060
perdurp its function by poking its own
 

481
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,990
perdurp its function by poking its own
DNA with the foreign DNA that we

482
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:57,000
DNA with the foreign DNA that we
 

483
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,250
DNA with the foreign DNA that we
engineer in the lab we work with E coli

484
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:00,260
engineer in the lab we work with E coli
 

485
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:03,230
engineer in the lab we work with E coli
it's the most simple in in terms of

486
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:03,240
it's the most simple in in terms of

not food so we helped we found a way to
 

657
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:55,610
not food so we helped we found a way to
fix our own nitrogen for ourselves yeah

810
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:23,280
is like a chemical decoding device and
 

811
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,390
is like a chemical decoding device and
that is incredibly unique for

812
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:26,400
that is incredibly unique for
 

813
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,829
that is incredibly unique for
translation that I don't think you will

814
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:27,839
translation that I don't think you will
 

815
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,370
translation that I don't think you will
find anywhere else in the cell that does

816
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:31,380
find anywhere else in the cell that does
 

817
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,590
find anywhere else in the cell that does
this so even though it's called

818
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:33,600
this so even though it's called
 

819
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,590
this so even though it's called
translation it's really like a factory

820
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:36,600
translation it's really like a factory
 

821
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,250
translation it's really like a factory
that reads the schematic

822
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:40,260
that reads the schematic
 

823
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:43,130
that reads the schematic
and builds a three-dimensional object

824
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:43,140
and builds a three-dimensional object
 

825
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,650
and builds a three-dimensional object
it's like a printer I would divide it

826
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:45,660
it's like a printer I would divide it
 

827
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,830
it's like a printer I would divide it
into actually even four more additional

00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:48,840
into actually even four more additional
 

829
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,529
into actually even four more additional
steps or disciplines than what would it

830
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:51,539
steps or disciplines than what would it
 

831
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:53,690
steps or disciplines than what would it
take to study it by the way you

832
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:53,700
take to study it by the way you
 

833
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:57,230
take to study it by the way you
described it it's a chemical system it's

834
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:57,240
described it it's a chemical system it's

00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:23,450
that's itself is computational and it's
biological it's a there's variability

computation so you're and that's so good

858
00:18:31,909 --> 00:18:31,919
computation so you're and that's so good
 

859
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:35,570
computation so you're and that's so good
so from the biology comes the like when

860
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:35,580
so from the biology comes the like when
 

861
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,830
so from the biology comes the like when
you mess up

862
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:36,840
you mess up
 

863
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,930
you mess up
the bugs of the features that's the

864
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:38,940
the bugs of the features that's the
 

865
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,510
the bugs of the features that's the
biology informatics is obvious in the

866
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:41,520
biology informatics is obvious in the
 

867
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,690
biology informatics is obvious in the
RNA that's a set of information there

868
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:43,700
RNA that's a set of information there

00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:47,029
RNA that's a set of information there
the different steps along the way is

870
00:18:47,029 --> 00:18:47,039
the different steps along the way is
 

871
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,590
the different steps along the way is
actually kind of what the computer does

872
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:48,600
actually kind of what the computer does
 

873
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,690
actually kind of what the computer does
with with bits its own computation

874
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:50,700
with with bits its own computation
 

875
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:55,310
with with bits its own computation
physical there's a uh I guess the the

876
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:55,320
physical there's a uh I guess the the
 

877
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,470
physical there's a uh I guess the the
like almost like a mechanical process to

878
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:57,480
like almost like a mechanical process to
 

879
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,510
like almost like a mechanical process to
the whole thing that requires energy and

880
00:18:59,510 --> 00:18:59,520
the whole thing that requires energy and
 

881
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,950
the whole thing that requires energy and
actually you know it's manipulating

882
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:00,960
actually you know it's manipulating
 

883
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,810
actually you know it's manipulating
actual physical objects

884
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:02,820
actual physical objects
 

885
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:05,570
actual physical objects
and uh chemicals because you're

886
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:05,580
and uh chemicals because you're
 

887
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,909
and uh chemicals because you're
have to ultimately it's all chemistry

888
00:19:07,909 --> 00:19:07,919
have to ultimately it's all chemistry
 

889
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:09,650
have to ultimately it's all chemistry
yeah and track system for me information

890
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:09,660
yeah and track system for me information
 

891
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:12,110
yeah and track system for me information
so it is almost a mini computer device

892
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:12,120
so it is almost a mini computer device
 

893
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,810
so it is almost a mini computer device
inside ourselves yeah and that's the

894
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:14,820
inside ourselves yeah and that's the
 

895
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,990
inside ourselves yeah and that's the
oldest uh computational device of life

896
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:18,000
oldest uh computational device of life
 

897
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,990
oldest uh computational device of life
it's it's uh likely the key uh operation

898
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:24,000
it's it's uh likely the key uh operation
 

899
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,470
it's it's uh likely the key uh operation
system that had to evolve for life to

900
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:27,480
system that had to evolve for life to
 

901
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,490
system that had to evolve for life to
emerge it's uh more interesting

902
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:31,500
emerge it's uh more interesting
 

903
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,789
emerge it's uh more interesting
or it's more complicated in interesting

904
00:19:34,789 --> 00:19:34,799
or it's more complicated in interesting
 

905
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,070
or it's more complicated in interesting
ways than the computers we have today I

906
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:37,080
ways than the computers we have today I
 

907
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,510
ways than the computers we have today I
mean everything you said which is really

908
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:38,520
mean everything you said which is really
 

909
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,549
mean everything you said which is really
really nice I mean I guess our computers

910
00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:40,559
really nice I mean I guess our computers
 

911
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,770
really nice I mean I guess our computers
have the informatic and they have the

912
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:42,780
have the informatic and they have the
 

913
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,230
have the informatic and they have the
computational but they don't have the

914
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:45,240
computational but they don't have the
 

915
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,549
computational but they don't have the
chemical the physical or the biology

916
00:19:46,549 --> 00:19:46,559
chemical the physical or the biology
 

917
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,310
chemical the physical or the biology
exactly and and the computers don't have

918
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:49,320
exactly and and the computers don't have
 

919
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,370
exactly and and the computers don't have
don't link information to function

920
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:52,380
don't link information to function
 

921
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,350
don't link information to function
right they are not tightly coupled

922
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:54,360
right they are not tightly coupled
 

923
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,070
right they are not tightly coupled
nowhere close to what translation

924
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:57,080
nowhere close to what translation
 

925
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,350
nowhere close to what translation
or the way translation does it so that's

926
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:00,360
or the way translation does it so that's
 

927
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,909
or the way translation does it so that's
the number one I think difference

928
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:01,919
the number one I think difference
 

929
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,409
the number one I think difference
between the two

930
00:20:03,409 --> 00:20:03,419
between the two
 

931
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:06,409
between the two
and um yes it's it's informatic and we

932
00:20:06,409 --> 00:20:06,419
and um yes it's it's informatic and we
 

933
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:11,110
and um yes it's it's informatic and we
can um uh discuss this further too 100

934
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:11,120
can um uh discuss this further too 100
 

935
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,210
can um uh discuss this further too 100
let's please discuss this further which

936
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:14,220
let's please discuss this further which
 

937
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,830
let's please discuss this further which
part are we discussing for each one of

938
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:15,840
part are we discussing for each one of
 

939
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,570
part are we discussing for each one of
those are fascinating worlds each each

940
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:17,580
those are fascinating worlds each each
 

941
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,970
those are fascinating worlds each each
of the five yeah so about we can start

942
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:19,980
of the five yeah so about we can start
 

943
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,789
of the five yeah so about we can start
with the more I guess the the ones that

944
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:22,799
with the more I guess the the ones that
 

945
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,590
with the more I guess the the ones that
are more established which is the the

946
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:24,600
are more established which is the the
 

947
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,350
are more established which is the the
chemical aspect of the translation

948
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:27,360
chemical aspect of the translation
 

949
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,310
chemical aspect of the translation
Machinery it's uh the specific compounds

950
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:31,320
Machinery it's uh the specific compounds
 

951
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,830
Machinery it's uh the specific compounds
make up the Assembly of RNA chemists

952
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:33,840
make up the Assembly of RNA chemists
 

953
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,010
make up the Assembly of RNA chemists
showed this in many different ways we

954
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:37,020
showed this in many different ways we
 

955
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:39,350
showed this in many different ways we
can rip apart the entire Machinery we

956
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:39,360
can rip apart the entire Machinery we
 

957
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,450
can rip apart the entire Machinery we
know that at the core of it there's an

itself but also as an enzyme and and
origin of Life chemists make these

970
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:54,179
origin of Life chemists make these
 

971
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:55,970
origin of Life chemists make these
molecules easily now we know we can

972
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:55,980
molecules easily now we know we can
 

973
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:58,310
molecules easily now we know we can
manipulate RNA we can make even with

974
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:58,320
manipulate RNA we can make even with
 

975
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,770
manipulate RNA we can make even with
single part chemistries we can create

976
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:00,780
single part chemistries we can create
 

977
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:04,010
single part chemistries we can create
compounds what's a single part chemistry

978
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:04,020
compounds what's a single part chemistry
 

979
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,590
compounds what's a single part chemistry
um that's I would say when you add all

980
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:06,600
um that's I would say when you add all
 

981
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,690
um that's I would say when you add all
the recipes that you know that will lead

982
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:08,700
the recipes that you know that will lead
 

983
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:12,650
the recipes that you know that will lead
you to the final products do is they

984
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:12,660
you to the final products do is they
 

985
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,390
you to the final products do is they
they come up with this pod they throw a

986
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:14,400
they come up with this pod they throw a
 

987
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,370
they come up with this pod they throw a
bunch of chemicals in and they try to

988
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:16,380
bunch of chemicals in and they try to
 

989
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:19,430
bunch of chemicals in and they try to
try to they're basically Chefs of a

990
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:19,440
try to they're basically Chefs of a
 

991
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,110
try to they're basically Chefs of a
certain kind I'm not sure if that's what

992
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:21,120
certain kind I'm not sure if that's what
 

993
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,549
certain kind I'm not sure if that's what
they call it but that's how I think of

994
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:22,559
they call it but that's how I think of
 

995
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,590
they call it but that's how I think of
it because it is all combined in a test

996
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:24,600
it because it is all combined in a test
 

997
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,110
it because it is all combined in a test
tube and you know the outcome and and

998
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:27,120
tube and you know the outcome and and
 

999
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,169
tube and you know the outcome and and
it's it's mathematical once you know the

1000
00:21:30,169 --> 00:21:30,179
it's it's mathematical once you know the
 

1001
00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:31,370
it's it's mathematical once you know the
right environment and the right

1002
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:31,380
right environment and the right
 

1003
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,110
right environment and the right
chemistry that needs to get into this

1004
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:33,120
chemistry that needs to get into this
 

1005
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,750
chemistry that needs to get into this
container or the spot you know what the

1006
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:35,760
container or the spot you know what the
 

1007
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,610
container or the spot you know what the
outcome is there's no luck there anymore

1008
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:37,620
outcome is there's no luck there anymore
 

1009
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:41,630
outcome is there's no luck there anymore
it's a pretty rigid established uh input

1010
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:41,640
it's a pretty rigid established uh input
 

1011
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,789
it's a pretty rigid established uh input
output system and it's all chemistry so

1012
00:21:43,789 --> 00:21:43,799
output system and it's all chemistry so
 

1013
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:46,190
output system and it's all chemistry so
you actually wear a lot of hats as one

1014
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:46,200
you actually wear a lot of hats as one
 

1015
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,370
you actually wear a lot of hats as one
of them original life chemist my PhD is

1016
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:49,380
of them original life chemist my PhD is
 

1017
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,409
of them original life chemist my PhD is
in chemistry but I don't do original

1018
00:21:51,409 --> 00:21:51,419
in chemistry but I don't do original
 

1019
00:21:51,419 --> 00:21:53,450
in chemistry but I don't do original
live chemistry but you're interested in

1020
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:53,460
live chemistry but you're interested in
 

1021
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,970
live chemistry but you're interested in
origin of Life yes absolutely so some of

1022
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:55,980
origin of Life yes absolutely so some of
 

1023
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,110
origin of Life yes absolutely so some of
your some of your best friends the

1024
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:57,120
your some of your best friends the
 

1025
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,810
your some of your best friends the
original life chemists just make sure

1026
00:21:59,810 --> 00:21:59,820
original life chemists just make sure
 

1027
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,549
original life chemists just make sure
that you have good chemist friends if

1028
00:22:01,549 --> 00:22:01,559
that you have good chemist friends if
 

1029
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:03,289
that you have good chemist friends if
you're interested in origin of Life yeah

1030
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:03,299
you're interested in origin of Life yeah
 

1031
00:22:03,299 --> 00:22:05,870
you're interested in origin of Life yeah
that's a hundred percent requirement

1032
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:05,880
that's a hundred percent requirement
 

1033
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,890
that's a hundred percent requirement
should be mandatory okay so chemistry uh

1034
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:09,900
should be mandatory okay so chemistry uh
 

1035
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,570
should be mandatory okay so chemistry uh
so what else about this Machinery that

1036
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:11,580
so what else about this Machinery that
 

1037
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,149
so what else about this Machinery that
we need to know chemically well uh

1038
00:22:14,149 --> 00:22:14,159
we need to know chemically well uh
 

1039
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:15,950
we need to know chemically well uh
chemically I think that that's it you

1040
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:15,960
chemically I think that that's it you
 

1041
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,690
chemically I think that that's it you
have enzymes you have proteins the

1042
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:17,700
have enzymes you have proteins the
 

1043
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,850
have enzymes you have proteins the
enzymes are doing their thing they know

1044
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:19,860
enzymes are doing their thing they know
 

1045
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:23,750
enzymes are doing their thing they know
how to chew energy using ATP or GTP they

1046
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:23,760
how to chew energy using ATP or GTP they
 

1047
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,210
how to chew energy using ATP or GTP they
they know what to do on their in their

1048
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:26,220
they know what to do on their in their
 

1049
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:29,210
they know what to do on their in their
own way they do their enzymatic thing so

1050
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:29,220
own way they do their enzymatic thing so
 

1051
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,970
own way they do their enzymatic thing so
it's not just the ribosome that is at

1052
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:31,980
it's not just the ribosome that is at
 

1053
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,830
it's not just the ribosome that is at
the heart of the transition but there

1054
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:33,840
the heart of the transition but there
 

1055
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,870
the heart of the transition but there
are a lot of different proteins you're

1056
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:35,880
are a lot of different proteins you're
 

1057
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,490
are a lot of different proteins you're
looking about a hundred different

1058
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:37,500
looking about a hundred different
 

1059
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,890
looking about a hundred different
components that compose this Machinery

1060
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:39,900
components that compose this Machinery
 

1061
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,649
components that compose this Machinery
uh well let me ask kind of maybe it's a

1062
00:22:42,649 --> 00:22:42,659
uh well let me ask kind of maybe it's a
 

1063
00:22:42,659 --> 00:22:44,149
uh well let me ask kind of maybe it's a
ridiculous question but did the

1064
00:22:44,149 --> 00:22:44,159
ridiculous question but did the
 

1065
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:45,770
ridiculous question but did the
chemistry

1066
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:45,780
chemistry
 

1067
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:49,990
chemistry
make this machine or did the machine

1068
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:50,000
make this machine or did the machine
 

1069
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,350
make this machine or did the machine
use chemistry to achieve a purpose

1070
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:54,360
use chemistry to achieve a purpose
 

1071
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,870
use chemistry to achieve a purpose
so like

1072
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:56,880
so like
 

1073
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,770
so like
um

1074
00:22:57,770 --> 00:22:57,780
um
 

1075
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,330
um
I guess there's a lot of different

1076
00:22:59,330 --> 00:22:59,340
I guess there's a lot of different
 

1077
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:02,149
I guess there's a lot of different
chemical possibilities on Earth

1078
00:23:02,149 --> 00:23:02,159
chemical possibilities on Earth
 

1079
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,850
chemical possibilities on Earth
is is this much translation Machinery

1080
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:04,860
is is this much translation Machinery
 

1081
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,049
is is this much translation Machinery
just like

1082
00:23:06,049 --> 00:23:06,059
just like
 

1083
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:08,149
just like
uh choosing picking and choosing

1084
00:23:08,149 --> 00:23:08,159
uh choosing picking and choosing
 

1085
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:09,409
uh choosing picking and choosing
different

1086
00:23:09,409 --> 00:23:09,419
different
 

1087
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:11,930
different
chemical reactions that it can use to

1088
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:11,940
chemical reactions that it can use to
 

1089
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,750
chemical reactions that it can use to
achieve a purpose

1090
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:13,760
achieve a purpose
 

1091
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,270
achieve a purpose
uh or did the chemistry basically

1092
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:17,280
uh or did the chemistry basically
 

1093
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,270
uh or did the chemistry basically
like uh there's like a momentum like a

1094
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:20,280
like uh there's like a momentum like a
 

1095
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,190
like uh there's like a momentum like a
constraint to the thing that can only

1096
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:22,200
constraint to the thing that can only
 

1097
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,590
constraint to the thing that can only
build a certain kind of Machinery that's

1098
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:24,600
build a certain kind of Machinery that's
 

1099
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,070
build a certain kind of Machinery that's
basically is is chemistry fundamental or

1100
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:28,080
basically is is chemistry fundamental or
 

1101
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,770
basically is is chemistry fundamental or
is is it just emergent like how

1102
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:30,780
is is it just emergent like how
 

1103
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,330
is is it just emergent like how
important is chemistry to this whole

1104
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:32,340
important is chemistry to this whole
 

1105
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:35,149
important is chemistry to this whole
process you cannot have

1106
00:23:35,149 --> 00:23:35,159
process you cannot have
 

1107
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:38,570
process you cannot have
chemistry

1108
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:38,580

 

1109
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:39,950

process without

1110
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:39,960
process without
 

1111
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,930
process without
chemistry what makes life interesting is

1112
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:41,940
chemistry what makes life interesting is
 

1113
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,490
chemistry what makes life interesting is
that even if the chemistry isn't perfect

1114
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:43,500
that even if the chemistry isn't perfect
 

1115
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,770
that even if the chemistry isn't perfect
even if there are accidents along the

1116
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:45,780
even if there are accidents along the
 

1117
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:49,510
even if there are accidents along the
way if something binds to another

1118
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:49,520
way if something binds to another
 

1119
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,270
way if something binds to another
chemical in in a way it shouldn't

1120
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:53,280
chemical in in a way it shouldn't
 

1121
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,310
chemical in in a way it shouldn't
um there is resilience within the system

1122
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:55,320
um there is resilience within the system
 

1123
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,649
um there is resilience within the system
that it can maybe not necessarily repair

1124
00:23:57,649 --> 00:23:57,659
that it can maybe not necessarily repair
 

1125
00:23:57,659 --> 00:23:59,930
that it can maybe not necessarily repair
itself but it moves on however in

1126
00:23:59,930 --> 00:23:59,940
itself but it moves on however in
 

1127
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:00,789
itself but it moves on however in

in but in terms of chemistry you

1134
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:06,360
in but in terms of chemistry you
 

1135
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,669
in but in terms of chemistry you
absolutely cannot have a transition

1136

yeah yes when you think of this machine

1152
00:24:27,649 --> 00:24:27,659
yeah yes when you think of this machine
 

1153
00:24:27,659 --> 00:24:30,049
yeah yes when you think of this machine
do you think very specifically about the

1154

kind of Machinery that we're talking
 

1157
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,810
kind of Machinery that we're talking
about or do you think more

00:24:51,529 --> 00:24:51,539
so for instance if we uh let's just
 

1173
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:54,770
so for instance if we uh let's just
talking about the chemistry part

00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:54,780
talking about the chemistry part
 

1175
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:55,390
talking about the chemistry part
um

1176
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:55,400
um
 

1177
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:59,029

this computation system you need to have
 

1195
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,909
this computation system you need to have
uh you can only afford a certain range

1196
00:25:22,909 --> 00:25:22,919
uh you can only afford a certain range
 

1197
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:25,490
uh you can only afford a certain range
of mistakes if you're too fast then the

1198
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:25,500
of mistakes if you're too fast then the
 

1199
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,769
of mistakes if you're too fast then the
next message cannot be delivered fast if

1200
00:25:27,769 --> 00:25:27,779
next message cannot be delivered fast if
 

1201
00:25:27,779 --> 00:25:29,690
next message cannot be delivered fast if
you're too slow then you may stall the

00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:32,269
you're too slow then you may stall the

1205
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:34,730

it's definitely through it's a party and

1224
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:55,500
it's definitely through it's a party and
 

1225
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,409
it's definitely through it's a party and
it's like everybody's invited and and

and they need to operate together all
 

1229
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,690
and they need to operate together all
right and and they um and what's really

1230
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:02,700
right and and they um and what's really
 

1231
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,310
right and and they um and what's really
cool about it I think or there are many

1232
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:04,320
cool about it I think or there are many
 

1233
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,289
cool about it I think or there are many
things that are very interesting about

00:26:06,289 --> 00:26:06,299
things that are very interesting about
 

1235
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:07,970
things that are very interesting about
this thing but if you take if you remove

1236
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:07,980
this thing but if you take if you remove
 

1237
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:10,669
this thing but if you take if you remove
it from the cell and put it in a Cell

1238
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:10,679
it from the cell and put it in a Cell
 

1239
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:13,730
it from the cell and put it in a Cell
free environment it works just fine

1240
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:13,740
free environment it works just fine
 

1241
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:16,250
free environment it works just fine
right so you can get cell free

1242
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:16,260
right so you can get cell free
 

1243
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:19,250
right so you can get cell free
translation systems uh put this

1244

at least so far
 

1255
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:35,330
at least so far
um but because we are far from evolving

00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,149
are trying to bring this perspective but
the more you understand how the

1288
00:27:17,149 --> 00:27:17,159
the more you understand how the
 

1289
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:19,549
the more you understand how the
information systems work you cannot once

1290
00:27:19,549 --> 00:27:19,559
information systems work you cannot once
 

1291
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:21,289
information systems work you cannot once
you see it you cannot unsee it it's one

1292
00:27:21,289 --> 00:27:21,299
you see it you cannot unsee it it's one
 

1293
00:27:21,299 --> 00:27:23,570
you see it you cannot unsee it it's one
of those things so but you can still bit

1294
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:23,580
of those things so but you can still bit
 

1295
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:26,269
of those things so but you can still bit
out and the chemistry happens yes and

1296
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:26,279
out and the chemistry happens yes and
 

1297
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:28,909
out and the chemistry happens yes and
chemistry can happen even with even if

1298
00:27:28,909 --> 00:27:28,919
chemistry can happen even with even if
 

1299
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:32,210
chemistry can happen even with even if
you strip some of the parts out it can

1300
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:32,220
you strip some of the parts out it can
 

1301
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:35,630
you strip some of the parts out it can
you can get very minimal level of

1302
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:35,640
you can get very minimal level of
 

1303
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,090
you can get very minimal level of
information processing that does not

1304
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:38,100
information processing that does not
 

1305
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,250
information processing that does not
look anything like the translation that

1306
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:40,260
look anything like the translation that
 

1307
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:43,070
look anything like the translation that
cells relies on but that what chemists

1308
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:43,080
cells relies on but that what chemists
 

1309
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,649
cells relies on but that what chemists
showed from linear you can generate

1310
00:27:45,649 --> 00:27:45,659
showed from linear you can generate
 

1311
00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:49,430
showed from linear you can generate
information that arrives to a processing

1312
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:49,440
information that arrives to a processing
 

1313
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,430
information that arrives to a processing
center in the form of a linear polymer

1314
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:52,440
center in the form of a linear polymer
 

1315
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:56,090
center in the form of a linear polymer
the informatic part of this system that

1316
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:56,100
the informatic part of this system that
 

1317
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:59,210
the informatic part of this system that
I think sets it apart from computation

1318
00:27:59,210 --> 00:27:59,220
I think sets it apart from computation
 

1319
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:02,390
I think sets it apart from computation
and from metabolism comes in if you

1320
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:02,400
and from metabolism comes in if you
 

1321
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,330
and from metabolism comes in if you
think about the information itself right

1322
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:05,340
think about the information itself right
 

1323
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:08,750
think about the information itself right
so we have four nucleotide letters that

1324
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:08,760
so we have four nucleotide letters that
 

1325
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:12,110
so we have four nucleotide letters that
compose DNA and they are processed in

1326
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:12,120
compose DNA and they are processed in
 

1327
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,269
compose DNA and they are processed in
the translation in triplets

1328
00:28:14,269 --> 00:28:14,279
the translation in triplets
 

1329
00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:17,090
the translation in triplets
so you have an in triplet codon

1330
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:17,100
so you have an in triplet codon
 

1331
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:20,630
so you have an in triplet codon
fragments so you have four times four

1332
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:20,640
fragments so you have four times four
 

1333
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,970
fragments so you have four times four
times four so you have 64 possible

1334
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:22,980
times four so you have 64 possible
 

1335
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:26,090
times four so you have 64 possible
states that can be encoded

1336
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:26,100
states that can be encoded
 

1337
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:29,750
states that can be encoded
by four letters in three positions

1338
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:29,760
by four letters in three positions
 

1339
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,630
by four letters in three positions
all right so it's so amazing yeah it's

1340
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:32,640
all right so it's so amazing yeah it's
 

1341
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,090
all right so it's so amazing yeah it's
so amazing there is only one code that

1342
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:35,100
so amazing there is only one code that
 

1343
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:38,390
so amazing there is only one code that
says start that's that there's only one

1344
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:38,400
says start that's that there's only one
 

1345
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,390
says start that's that there's only one
and then there's two if not three that

1346
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:41,400
and then there's two if not three that
 

1347
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,890
and then there's two if not three that
says stop

1348
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:42,900
says stop
 

1349
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,110
says stop
so that's that's that's what you work

1350
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:45,120
so that's that's that's what you work
 

1351
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,590
so that's that's that's what you work
with but you can have 64 possible States

1352
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:48,600
with but you can have 64 possible States
 

1353
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:53,510
with but you can have 64 possible States
but life only uses 20. amino acids so we

1354
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:53,520
but life only uses 20. amino acids so we
 

1355
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,850
but life only uses 20. amino acids so we
used six live users 64 possible States

1356
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:55,860
used six live users 64 possible States
 

1357
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:59,149
used six live users 64 possible States
minus four of the starts and stops to

1358
00:28:59,149 --> 00:28:59,159
minus four of the starts and stops to
 

1359
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:01,250
minus four of the starts and stops to
code for 20 amino acids in different

1360
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:01,260
code for 20 amino acids in different
 

1361
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,110
code for 20 amino acids in different
combinations

1362
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:03,120
combinations
 

1363
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,750
combinations
that is really amazing if you think

1364
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:05,760
that is really amazing if you think
 

1365
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,850
that is really amazing if you think
about there there are 500 different

1366
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:07,860
about there there are 500 different
 

1367
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:11,210
about there there are 500 different
amino acids life can choose right it's

1368
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:11,220
amino acids life can choose right it's
 

1369
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,890
amino acids life can choose right it's
narrowed it down to training we don't

1370
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:12,900
narrowed it down to training we don't
 

1371
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,870
narrowed it down to training we don't
know why a lot of people think about

1372
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:14,880
know why a lot of people think about
 

1373
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,269
know why a lot of people think about
this genetic code is quite fascinating

1374
00:29:17,269 --> 00:29:17,279
this genetic code is quite fascinating
 

1375
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:19,669
this genetic code is quite fascinating
right I mean it didn't do it for four

1376
00:29:19,669 --> 00:29:19,679
right I mean it didn't do it for four
 

1377
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:21,230
right I mean it didn't do it for four
billion years I don't know we may wait

1378
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:21,240
billion years I don't know we may wait
 

1379
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,850
billion years I don't know we may wait
for another four billion years but but

1380
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:22,860
for another four billion years but but
 

1381
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,470
for another four billion years but but
you didn't have those amino acids in the

1382
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:24,480
you didn't have those amino acids in the
 

1383
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,029
you didn't have those amino acids in the
very beginning right like you don't know

1384
00:29:26,029 --> 00:29:26,039
very beginning right like you don't know
 

1385
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:28,370
very beginning right like you don't know
so it we would be fooling ourselves if

1386
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:28,380
so it we would be fooling ourselves if
 

1387
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:30,830
so it we would be fooling ourselves if
we said we know exactly how many amino

1388
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:30,840
we said we know exactly how many amino
 

1389
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,649
we said we know exactly how many amino
acids existed early on but there's no

1390
00:29:33,649 --> 00:29:33,659
acids existed early on but there's no
 

1391
00:29:33,659 --> 00:29:36,529
acids existed early on but there's no
reason to think that it it wasn't the

1392
00:29:36,529 --> 00:29:36,539
reason to think that it it wasn't the
 

1393
00:29:36,539 --> 00:29:39,889
reason to think that it it wasn't the
same or similar yeah we don't we don't

1394
00:29:39,889 --> 00:29:39,899
same or similar yeah we don't we don't
 

1395
00:29:39,899 --> 00:29:41,990
same or similar yeah we don't we don't
have a good reason but

1396
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:42,000
have a good reason but
 

1397
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,889
have a good reason but
but because roughly 20 out of 60 states

1398
00:29:45,889 --> 00:29:45,899
but because roughly 20 out of 60 states
 

1399
00:29:45,899 --> 00:29:48,889
but because roughly 20 out of 60 states
are used you're using one-third of your

1400
00:29:48,889 --> 00:29:48,899
are used you're using one-third of your
 

1401
00:29:48,899 --> 00:29:50,930
are used you're using one-third of your
possible states in the in your

1402
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:50,940
possible states in the in your
 

1403
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:54,169
possible states in the in your
information system so it this may seem

1404
00:29:54,169 --> 00:29:54,179
information system so it this may seem
 

1405
00:29:54,179 --> 00:29:57,649
information system so it this may seem
like a waste but informatically it's

1406
00:29:57,649 --> 00:29:57,659
like a waste but informatically it's
 

1407
00:29:57,659 --> 00:29:59,750
like a waste but informatically it's
important because it's abundant and it

1408
00:29:59,750 --> 00:29:59,760
important because it's abundant and it
 

1409
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:04,789
important because it's abundant and it
is uh redundant right so so this code

1410
00:30:04,789 --> 00:30:04,799
is uh redundant right so so this code
 

1411
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:07,430
is uh redundant right so so this code
degeneracy you see this in that's

1412
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:07,440
degeneracy you see this in that's
 

1413
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,750
degeneracy you see this in that's
implemented by this translation

1414
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:08,760
implemented by this translation
 

1415
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,970

so it means we can make errors right you

1418
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:13,440
so it means we can make errors right you
 

1419
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,350
so it means we can make errors right you
can make errors but the message will

1420
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:15,360
can make errors but the message will
 

1421
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,690
can make errors but the message will
still get through you you can speak

1422
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:17,700
still get through you you can speak
 

1423
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,850
still get through you you can speak
missing some letters to the information

1424
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:19,860
missing some letters to the information
 

1425
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,889
missing some letters to the information
can miss some parts but the message will

1426
00:30:21,889 --> 00:30:21,899
can miss some parts but the message will
 

1427
00:30:21,899 --> 00:30:23,930
can miss some parts but the message will
still get through so that's two-thirds

1428
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:23,940
still get through so that's two-thirds
 

1429
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:26,630
still get through so that's two-thirds
of the not used States give gives you

1430
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:26,640
of the not used States give gives you
 

1431
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,610
of the not used States give gives you
that robustness and resilience within

1432
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:28,620
that robustness and resilience within
 

1433
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,590
that robustness and resilience within
this system so at the informatic level

1434
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:30,600
this system so at the informatic level
 

1435
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,750
this system so at the informatic level
there's room for error there's probably

1436
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:32,760
there's room for error there's probably
 

1437
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:36,370
there's room for error there's probably
room for probably in all five

1438
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:36,380
room for probably in all five
 

1439
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:38,510
room for probably in all five
uh categories we're talking about

1440
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:38,520
uh categories we're talking about
 

1441
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,769
uh categories we're talking about
there's probably room for air in the

1442
00:30:39,769 --> 00:30:39,779
there's probably room for air in the
 

1443
00:30:39,779 --> 00:30:41,029
there's probably room for air in the
computation there's probably room from

1444
00:30:41,029 --> 00:30:41,039
computation there's probably room from
 

1445
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,730
computation there's probably room from
area there's yes exactly everywhere yeah

1446
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:43,740
area there's yes exactly everywhere yeah
 

1447
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,830
area there's yes exactly everywhere yeah
because because the the informatic

1448
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:45,840
because because the the informatic
 

1449
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,990
because because the the informatic
capacity is made possible together with

1450
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:48,000
capacity is made possible together with
 

1451
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,310
capacity is made possible together with
the other

1452
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:49,320
the other
 

1453
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,710
the other
um components and not only that but also

1454
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:51,720
um components and not only that but also
 

1455
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,649
um components and not only that but also
the the product yields

1456
00:30:54,649 --> 00:30:54,659
the the product yields
 

1457
00:30:54,659 --> 00:30:57,669
the the product yields
a function no

1458
00:30:57,669 --> 00:30:57,679
a function no
 

1459
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:01,070
a function no
in this case enzyme are pretty right so

1460
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:01,080
in this case enzyme are pretty right so
 

1461
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,269
in this case enzyme are pretty right so
so

1462
00:31:02,269 --> 00:31:02,279
so
 

1463
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:05,090
so
that's really amazing for me it is I

1464
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:05,100
that's really amazing for me it is I
 

1465
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,889
that's really amazing for me it is I
mean I mean in my head just so you know

1466
00:31:06,889 --> 00:31:06,899
mean I mean in my head just so you know
 

1467
00:31:06,899 --> 00:31:09,430
mean I mean in my head just so you know
because I'm a computer science AI person

1468
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:09,440
because I'm a computer science AI person
 

1469
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,649
because I'm a computer science AI person
the the parallels between even like

1470
00:31:12,649 --> 00:31:12,659
the the parallels between even like
 

1471
00:31:12,659 --> 00:31:16,130
the the parallels between even like
language models that encode language

1472
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:16,140
language models that encode language
 

1473
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,230
language models that encode language
or now they're able to encode basically

1474
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:18,240
or now they're able to encode basically
 

1475
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,630
or now they're able to encode basically
any kind of thing including

1476
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:20,640
any kind of thing including
 

1477
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,870
any kind of thing including
um images and actions all in this kind

1478
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:23,880
um images and actions all in this kind
 

1479
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,769
um images and actions all in this kind
of way

1480
00:31:24,769 --> 00:31:24,779
of way
 

1481
00:31:24,779 --> 00:31:27,289
of way
the the parallel in in terms of

1482
00:31:27,289 --> 00:31:27,299
the the parallel in in terms of
 

1483
00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:30,710
the the parallel in in terms of
informatic and uh computation

1484
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:30,720
informatic and uh computation
 

1485
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,590
informatic and uh computation
is just incredible actually

1486
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:33,600
is just incredible actually
 

1487
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,230
is just incredible actually
um I have a image maybe I can send you

1488
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:36,240
um I have a image maybe I can send you
 

1489
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,149
um I have a image maybe I can send you
can we pull it up now if you just do

1490
00:31:38,149 --> 00:31:38,159
can we pull it up now if you just do
 

1491
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,669
can we pull it up now if you just do
genetic codon charts we can pull that

1492
00:31:40,669 --> 00:31:40,679
genetic codon charts we can pull that
 

1493
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:43,730
genetic codon charts we can pull that
off yeah it's a very standard table

1494
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:43,740
off yeah it's a very standard table
 

1495
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:46,310
off yeah it's a very standard table
so I can I can explain what why this is

1496
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:46,320
so I can I can explain what why this is
 

1497
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,889
so I can I can explain what why this is
so amazing so you're looking at um like

1498
00:31:48,889 --> 00:31:48,899
so amazing so you're looking at um like
 

1499
00:31:48,899 --> 00:31:50,930
so amazing so you're looking at um like
this is life's alphabet right and so I

1500
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:50,940
this is life's alphabet right and so I
 

1501
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,850
this is life's alphabet right and so I
also want to make a very quick link now

1502
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:52,860
also want to make a very quick link now
 

1503
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:56,450
also want to make a very quick link now
to your first question the Tree of Life

1504
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:56,460
to your first question the Tree of Life
 

1505
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:59,090
to your first question the Tree of Life
um when when we link when we try to

1506
00:31:59,090 --> 00:31:59,100
um when when we link when we try to
 

1507
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,970
um when when we link when we try to
understand ancient languages right or

1508
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:01,980
understand ancient languages right or
 

1509
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:05,450
understand ancient languages right or
the cultures of the or the cultures uh

1510
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:05,460
the cultures of the or the cultures uh
 

1511
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:08,330
the cultures of the or the cultures uh
that use these extinct languages we

1512
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:08,340
that use these extinct languages we
 

1513
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:10,490
that use these extinct languages we
start with the modern languages right so

1514
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:10,500
start with the modern languages right so
 

1515
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,930
start with the modern languages right so
we look at

1516
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:11,940
we look at
 

1517
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,549
we look at
um Indo-European

1518
00:32:13,549 --> 00:32:13,559
um Indo-European
 

1519
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:15,470
um Indo-European
languages and and try to understand

1520
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:15,480
languages and and try to understand
 

1521
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:19,490
languages and and try to understand
certain words and make trees

1522
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:19,500
certain words and make trees
 

1523
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,289
certain words and make trees
um to understand you know this is what

1524
00:32:21,289 --> 00:32:21,299
um to understand you know this is what
 

1525
00:32:21,299 --> 00:32:24,649
um to understand you know this is what
uh Slavic word is for snow something

1526
00:32:24,649 --> 00:32:24,659
uh Slavic word is for snow something
 

1527
00:32:24,659 --> 00:32:27,230
uh Slavic word is for snow something
like snig now we jump to languages that

1528
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:27,240
like snig now we jump to languages that
 

1529
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,730
like snig now we jump to languages that
humans spoken humans talk history

1530
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:28,740
humans spoken humans talk history
 

1531
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:31,070
humans spoken humans talk history
exactly so we make trees to understand

1532
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:31,080
exactly so we make trees to understand
 

1533
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:34,130
exactly so we make trees to understand
what is the original ancestor what did

1534
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:34,140
what is the original ancestor what did
 

1535
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:37,250
what is the original ancestor what did
they use to say snow and if you have a

1536
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:37,260
they use to say snow and if you have a
 

1537
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,690
they use to say snow and if you have a
lot of cultures who use the word snow

1538
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:38,700
lot of cultures who use the word snow
 

1539
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:41,450
lot of cultures who use the word snow
you can imagine that uh it was snowy

1540
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:41,460
you can imagine that uh it was snowy
 

1541
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,850
you can imagine that uh it was snowy
that's why they needed that word it's

1542
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:43,860
that's why they needed that word it's
 

1543
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:46,610
that's why they needed that word it's
the same thing for biology right if if

1544
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:46,620
the same thing for biology right if if
 

1545
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:49,070
the same thing for biology right if if
they have some if we understand some

1546
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:49,080
they have some if we understand some
 

1547
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,110
they have some if we understand some
function about that enzyme we can

1548
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:51,120
function about that enzyme we can
 

1549
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,149
function about that enzyme we can
understand the environment that they

1550
00:32:53,149 --> 00:32:53,159
understand the environment that they
 

1551
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:55,430
understand the environment that they
lived in it's it's the similar it's

1552
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:55,440
lived in it's it's the similar it's
 

1553
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,810
lived in it's it's the similar it's
similar in that sense so now you're

1554
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:56,820
similar in that sense so now you're
 

1555
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:59,810
similar in that sense so now you're
looking at the alphabet for of life in

1556
00:32:59,810 --> 00:32:59,820
looking at the alphabet for of life in
 

1557
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:02,330
looking at the alphabet for of life in
this case it's not 20 or 25 letters it's

1558
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:02,340
this case it's not 20 or 25 letters it's
 

1559
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:06,169
this case it's not 20 or 25 letters it's
you have four letters so what is really

1560
00:33:06,169 --> 00:33:06,179
you have four letters so what is really
 

1561
00:33:06,179 --> 00:33:09,110
you have four letters so what is really
interesting that stands out to me when I

1562
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:09,120
interesting that stands out to me when I
 

1563
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,330
interesting that stands out to me when I
look at this on the outer shell you're

1564
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:11,340
look at this on the outer shell you're
 

1565
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:13,130
look at this on the outer shell you're
looking at the 20 amino acids that's

1566
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:13,140
looking at the 20 amino acids that's
 

1567
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:15,950
looking at the 20 amino acids that's
composed life right the one the

1568
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:15,960
composed life right the one the
 

1569
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,889
composed life right the one the
methionine that you see that's the start

1570
00:33:18,889 --> 00:33:18,899
methionine that you see that's the start
 

1571
00:33:18,899 --> 00:33:21,590
methionine that you see that's the start
so the start is always the same to me

1572
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:21,600
so the start is always the same to me
 

1573
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,049
so the start is always the same to me
that is fascinating that all Life starts

1574
00:33:24,049 --> 00:33:24,059
that is fascinating that all Life starts
 

1575
00:33:24,059 --> 00:33:25,669
that is fascinating that all Life starts
with the same starts there's no other

1576
00:33:25,669 --> 00:33:25,679
with the same starts there's no other
 

1577
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:29,750
with the same starts there's no other
start code so you sent the uh AG you

1578
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:29,760
start code so you sent the uh AG you
 

1579
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,570
start code so you sent the uh AG you
know Aug to the cell that when that

1580
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:32,580
know Aug to the cell that when that
 

1581
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:35,090
know Aug to the cell that when that
information arrives the transition knows

1582
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:35,100
information arrives the transition knows
 

1583
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,070
information arrives the transition knows
all right I gotta start function is

1584
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:37,080
all right I gotta start function is
 

1585
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:40,070
all right I gotta start function is

00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:54,360
shell and there's an inner shell all
 

1599
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,610
shell and there's an inner shell all
used in the four letters that we're

1600
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:55,620
used in the four letters that we're
 

1601
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,830
used in the four letters that we're
talking about with that we can compose

1602
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:57,840
talking about with that we can compose
 

1603
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,870
talking about with that we can compose
all of the amino acids then there's a

1604
00:33:59,870 --> 00:33:59,880
all of the amino acids then there's a
 

1605
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,870
all of the amino acids then there's a
start and there's a stop and presumably

1606
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:02,880
start and there's a stop and presumably
 

1607
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,470
start and there's a stop and presumably
you put together the the with these

1608
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:06,480
you put together the the with these
 

1609
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,329
you put together the the with these
letters you walk around the wheel to put

1610
00:34:08,329 --> 00:34:08,339
letters you walk around the wheel to put
 

1611
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:10,849
letters you walk around the wheel to put
together the words the sentences that

1612
00:34:10,849 --> 00:34:10,859
together the words the sentences that
 

1613
00:34:10,859 --> 00:34:14,149
together the words the sentences that
yeah reverse the sentences and you to

1614
00:34:14,149 --> 00:34:14,159
yeah reverse the sentences and you to
 

1615
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,129
yeah reverse the sentences and you to
again you get one start you get three

1616
00:34:16,129 --> 00:34:16,139
again you get one start you get three
 

1617
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:17,810
again you get one start you get three
there are three different ways to stop

1618
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:17,820
there are three different ways to stop
 

1619
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:21,169
there are three different ways to stop
this one way to start it and for each

1620
00:34:21,169 --> 00:34:21,179
this one way to start it and for each
 

1621
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:24,530
this one way to start it and for each
letter you have multiple options so you

1622
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:24,540
letter you have multiple options so you
 

1623
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:27,050
letter you have multiple options so you
say you have a code a the second code

1624
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:27,060
say you have a code a the second code
 

1625
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:29,810
say you have a code a the second code
can be another a and even if you mess

1626
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:29,820
can be another a and even if you mess
 

1627
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:32,329
can be another a and even if you mess
that up you still can rescue yourself so

1628
00:34:32,329 --> 00:34:32,339
that up you still can rescue yourself so
 

1629
00:34:32,339 --> 00:34:34,010
that up you still can rescue yourself so
you can get it for instance I'm looking

1630
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:34,020
you can get it for instance I'm looking
 

1631
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:37,010
you can get it for instance I'm looking
at the lysine Decay you get an A and you

1632
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:37,020
at the lysine Decay you get an A and you
 

1633
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:38,690
at the lysine Decay you get an A and you
get an A and then you get an A that

1634
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:38,700
get an A and then you get an A that
 

1635
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,970
get an A and then you get an A that
gives you the lysine right but if you

1636
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:40,980
gives you the lysine right but if you
 

1637
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,950
gives you the lysine right but if you
get an A and if you get an A then get a

1638
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:42,960
get an A and if you get an A then get a
 

1639
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,589
get an A and if you get an A then get a
g you still get the license so there are

1640
00:34:45,589 --> 00:34:45,599
g you still get the license so there are
 

1641
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,510
g you still get the license so there are
different combinations so even if

1642
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:47,520
different combinations so even if
 

1643
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,250
different combinations so even if
there's an error we don't know if these

1644
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:49,260
there's an error we don't know if these
 

1645
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:51,409
there's an error we don't know if these
are selected because they were Earnest

1646
00:34:51,409 --> 00:34:51,419
are selected because they were Earnest
 

1647
00:34:51,419 --> 00:34:53,270
are selected because they were Earnest
and somehow they got locked down we

1648
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:53,280
and somehow they got locked down we
 

1649
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,490
and somehow they got locked down we
don't know if there is a mechanism

1650
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:55,500
don't know if there is a mechanism
 

1651
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:58,730
don't know if there is a mechanism
behind this to or we we certainly don't

1652
00:34:58,730 --> 00:34:58,740
behind this to or we we certainly don't
 

1653
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:00,230
behind this to or we we certainly don't
know this definitively

1654
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:00,240
know this definitively
 

1655
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,410
know this definitively
but this is informatic uh part of this

1656
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:03,420
but this is informatic uh part of this
 

1657
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,810
but this is informatic uh part of this
and notice that the colors in some

1658
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:05,820
and notice that the colors in some
 

1659
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:08,329
and notice that the colors in some
tables too the colors will be coded in a

1660
00:35:08,329 --> 00:35:08,339
tables too the colors will be coded in a
 

1661
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:10,730
tables too the colors will be coded in a
way that um the the type of the

1662
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:10,740
way that um the the type of the
 

1663
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:13,790
way that um the the type of the
nucleotide can be similar chemically uh

1664
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:13,800
nucleotide can be similar chemically uh
 

1665
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,130
nucleotide can be similar chemically uh
but the point is that you will still end

1666
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:16,140
but the point is that you will still end
 

1667
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:18,290
but the point is that you will still end
up with the same amino acids or

1668
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:18,300
up with the same amino acids or
 

1669
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,089
up with the same amino acids or
something similar to it even if you mess

1670
00:35:20,089 --> 00:35:20,099
something similar to it even if you mess
 

1671
00:35:20,099 --> 00:35:21,710
something similar to it even if you mess
up the code do we understand the

1672
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:21,720
up the code do we understand the
 

1673
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,870
up the code do we understand the
mechanism how natural selection

1674
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:23,880
mechanism how natural selection
 

1675
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:28,370
mechanism how natural selection
interplays with this resilience to error

1676
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:28,380
interplays with this resilience to error
 

1677
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:30,290
interplays with this resilience to error
so which errors

1678
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:30,300
so which errors
 

1679
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,530
so which errors
result in the same

1680
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:32,540
result in the same
 

1681
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:36,290
result in the same
uh the output like the same function and

1682
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:36,300
uh the output like the same function and
 

1683
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,430
uh the output like the same function and
which don't

1684
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:37,440
which don't
 

1685
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,470
which don't
uh which actually results in a

1686
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:39,480
uh which actually results in a
 

1687
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,870
uh which actually results in a
dysfunction which are we understand to

1688
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:41,880
dysfunction which are we understand to
 

1689
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,990
dysfunction which are we understand to
some degree the how translation and the

1690
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:45,000
some degree the how translation and the
 

1691
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,030
some degree the how translation and the
rest of the cell work together

1692
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:47,040
rest of the cell work together
 

1693
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,730
rest of the cell work together
have an error at the translation level

1694
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:49,740
have an error at the translation level
 

1695
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:52,130
have an error at the translation level
this is a really core level can impact

1696
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:52,140
this is a really core level can impact
 

1697
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:55,550
this is a really core level can impact
entire cells but we understand very

1698
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:55,560
entire cells but we understand very
 

1699
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:58,670
entire cells but we understand very
little about the evolutionary mechanisms

1700
00:35:58,670 --> 00:35:58,680
little about the evolutionary mechanisms
 

1701
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:02,030
little about the evolutionary mechanisms
behind the selection of the system it's

1702
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:02,040
behind the selection of the system it's
 

1703
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,829
behind the selection of the system it's
thought to be as one of the hardest

1704
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:03,839
thought to be as one of the hardest
 

1705
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:06,109
thought to be as one of the hardest
problems in biology and it is still the

1706
00:36:06,109 --> 00:36:06,119
problems in biology and it is still the
 

1707
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:08,630
problems in biology and it is still the
Dark Side of biology we even though it

1708
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:08,640
Dark Side of biology we even though it
 

1709
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,970
Dark Side of biology we even though it
is so essential

1710
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:10,980
is so essential
 

1711
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:14,990
is so essential
so this is uh yeah you're looking at the

1712
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:15,000
so this is uh yeah you're looking at the
 

1713
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,990
so this is uh yeah you're looking at the
language of life so to speak and how it

1714
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:18,000
language of life so to speak and how it
 

1715
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,190
language of life so to speak and how it
can found ways rather to it to tolerate

1716
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:22,200
can found ways rather to it to tolerate
 

1717
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,770
can found ways rather to it to tolerate
its own mistakes so the entire

1718
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:24,780
its own mistakes so the entire
 

1719
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:26,810
its own mistakes so the entire
phylogenetic tree

1720
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:26,820
phylogenetic tree
 

1721
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:31,069
phylogenetic tree
can be like uh deconstructed with this

1722
00:36:31,069 --> 00:36:31,079
can be like uh deconstructed with this
 

1723
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:34,190
can be like uh deconstructed with this
wheel of language because all the final

1724
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:34,200
wheel of language because all the final
 

1725
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,829
wheel of language because all the final
letters those are that's the 20 amino

1726
00:36:36,829 --> 00:36:36,839
letters those are that's the 20 amino
 

1727
00:36:36,839 --> 00:36:39,109
letters those are that's the 20 amino
acids that's our alphabet they are all

1728
00:36:39,109 --> 00:36:39,119
acids that's our alphabet they are all
 

1729
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:41,569
acids that's our alphabet they are all
brought together with these bits of

1730
00:36:41,569 --> 00:36:41,579
brought together with these bits of
 

1731
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:44,390
brought together with these bits of
information right so you when you look

1732
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:44,400
information right so you when you look
 

1733
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,650
information right so you when you look
at the genes you're looking at those

1734
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:45,660
at the genes you're looking at those
 

1735
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,089
at the genes you're looking at those
four letters when you look at the

1736
00:36:47,089 --> 00:36:47,099
four letters when you look at the
 

1737
00:36:47,099 --> 00:36:48,770
four letters when you look at the
proteins you're looking at the 20 amino

1738
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:48,780
proteins you're looking at the 20 amino
 

1739
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:52,010
proteins you're looking at the 20 amino
acids uh which may be a little easier

1740
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:52,020
acids uh which may be a little easier
 

1741
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,930
acids uh which may be a little easier
way to track the information when we

1742
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:53,940
way to track the information when we
 

1743
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,130
way to track the information when we
create

1744
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:55,140
create
 

1745
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:58,310
create
um the tree so using this language we

1746
00:36:58,310 --> 00:36:58,320
um the tree so using this language we
 

1747
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,710
um the tree so using this language we
can describe all life that's lived on

1748
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:00,720
can describe all life that's lived on
 

1749
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,740
can describe all life that's lived on
earth

00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:07,380
we are not that good at it yet right so
 

1755
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:10,609
we are not that good at it yet right so
in theory this is one way to look at

1756
00:37:10,609 --> 00:37:10,619
in theory this is one way to look at
 

1757
00:37:10,619 --> 00:37:13,130
in theory this is one way to look at
life on Earth if you're a biologist and

1758
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:13,140
life on Earth if you're a biologist and
 

1759
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:16,490
life on Earth if you're a biologist and
you want to understand how life evolved

1760
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:16,500
you want to understand how life evolved
 

1761
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,190
you want to understand how life evolved
uh from a molecular perspective this

1762
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:19,200
uh from a molecular perspective this
 

1763
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:22,010
uh from a molecular perspective this
would be the way to do it and and this

1764
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:22,020
would be the way to do it and and this
 

1765
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:25,190
would be the way to do it and and this
is what nature narrowed its code down to

1766
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:25,200
is what nature narrowed its code down to
 

1767
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,530
is what nature narrowed its code down to
so maybe think of nitrogen than we think

1768
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:27,540
so maybe think of nitrogen than we think
 

1769
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:30,349
so maybe think of nitrogen than we think
of carbon when we think of sulfur it's

1770
00:37:30,349 --> 00:37:30,359
of carbon when we think of sulfur it's
 

1771
00:37:30,359 --> 00:37:32,829
of carbon when we think of sulfur it's
all in this that the all these

1772
00:37:32,829 --> 00:37:32,839
all in this that the all these
 

1773
00:37:32,839 --> 00:37:35,510
all in this that the all these
nucleotides are built based on those

1774
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:35,520
nucleotides are built based on those
 

1775
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,970
nucleotides are built based on those
elements and this is fundamentally the

1776
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:37,980
elements and this is fundamentally the
 

1777
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:40,190
elements and this is fundamentally the
informatic perspective exactly that's

1778
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:40,200
informatic perspective exactly that's
 

1779
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,109
informatic perspective exactly that's
that's the informatic perspective and

1780
00:37:42,109 --> 00:37:42,119
that's the informatic perspective and
 

1781
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:44,510
that's the informatic perspective and
it's important to emphasize that this is

1782
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:44,520
it's important to emphasize that this is
 

1783
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:48,349
it's important to emphasize that this is
not engineered by humans this is this

1784
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:48,359
not engineered by humans this is this
 

1785
00:37:48,359 --> 00:37:52,250
not engineered by humans this is this
evolved by itself like right humans

1786
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:52,260
evolved by itself like right humans
 

1787
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:54,050
evolved by itself like right humans
didn't invent this just because we were

1788
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:54,060
didn't invent this just because we were
 

1789
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,790
didn't invent this just because we were
just describing we're trying to find

1790
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:55,800
just describing we're trying to find
 

1791
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,370
just describing we're trying to find
trying to describe the language of life

1792
00:37:58,370 --> 00:37:58,380
trying to describe the language of life
 

1793
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:01,970
trying to describe the language of life
it's it appears to be a highly optimized

1794
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:01,980
it's it appears to be a highly optimized
 

1795
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:05,329
it's it appears to be a highly optimized
chemical and information code

1796
00:38:05,329 --> 00:38:05,339
chemical and information code
 

1797
00:38:05,339 --> 00:38:07,849
chemical and information code
um it it may indicate that a great deal

1798
00:38:07,849 --> 00:38:07,859
um it it may indicate that a great deal
 

1799
00:38:07,859 --> 00:38:13,130
um it it may indicate that a great deal
of chemical Evolution and uh and and

1800
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:13,140
of chemical Evolution and uh and and
 

1801
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:15,410
of chemical Evolution and uh and and
this may indicate that a lot of

1802
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:15,420
this may indicate that a lot of
 

1803
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,970
this may indicate that a lot of
selection pressure and darwinian

1804
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:16,980
selection pressure and darwinian
 

1805
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:18,710
selection pressure and darwinian
evolution happened with prior to the

1806
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:18,720
evolution happened with prior to the
 

1807
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,569
evolution happened with prior to the
rise of last Universal common ancestor

1808
00:38:20,569 --> 00:38:20,579
rise of last Universal common ancestor
 

1809
00:38:20,579 --> 00:38:23,630
rise of last Universal common ancestor
because this is uh almost a bridge that

1810
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:23,640
because this is uh almost a bridge that
 

1811
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,370
because this is uh almost a bridge that
connects the early cells to the last

1812
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:25,380
connects the early cells to the last
 

1813
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,290
connects the early cells to the last
Universal common ancestor okay can you

1814
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:27,300
Universal common ancestor okay can you
 

1815
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,690
Universal common ancestor okay can you
describe what the heck you just said uh

1816
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:29,700
describe what the heck you just said uh
 

1817
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,870
describe what the heck you just said uh
so this

1818
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:31,880
so this
 

1819
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:35,510
so this
mechanism evolved before the what

1820
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:35,520
mechanism evolved before the what
 

1821
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,310
mechanism evolved before the what
combination so there's the last

1822
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:37,320
combination so there's the last
 

1823
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,050
combination so there's the last
Universal government so when we talk

1824
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:39,060
Universal government so when we talk
 

1825
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,670
Universal government so when we talk
about the tree when we think about the

1826
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:40,680
about the tree when we think about the
 

1827
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:45,770
about the tree when we think about the
root if you I ideally uh included all

1828
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:45,780
root if you I ideally uh included all
 

1829
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:48,770
root if you I ideally uh included all
the living information or all the

1830
00:38:48,770 --> 00:38:48,780
the living information or all the
 

1831
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:50,270
the living information or all the
available information that comes from

1832
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:50,280
available information that comes from
 

1833
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:53,450
available information that comes from
living organisms on your tree then it on

1834
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:53,460
living organisms on your tree then it on
 

1835
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:55,370
living organisms on your tree then it on
the root of your tree lies the last

1836
00:38:55,370 --> 00:38:55,380
the root of your tree lies the last
 

1837
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:58,010
the root of your tree lies the last
Universal common ancestor Luca right why

1838
00:38:58,010 --> 00:38:58,020
Universal common ancestor Luca right why
 

1839
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:01,730
Universal common ancestor Luca right why
last last Universal because the earlier

1840
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:01,740
last last Universal because the earlier
 

1841
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:04,310
last last Universal because the earlier
Universe it also had trees but they all

1842
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:04,320
Universe it also had trees but they all
 

1843
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,710
Universe it also had trees but they all
died off we call it the last because it

1844
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:06,720
died off we call it the last because it
 

1845
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,470
died off we call it the last because it
is sort of the first one that we can

1846
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:09,480
is sort of the first one that we can
 

1847
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,230
is sort of the first one that we can
track

1848
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:11,240
track
 

1849
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:14,030
track
because we cannot we don't know what we

1850
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:14,040
because we cannot we don't know what we
 

1851
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,550
because we cannot we don't know what we
cannot track right so it's one there's

1852
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:16,560
cannot track right so it's one there's
 

1853
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,109
cannot track right so it's one there's
one organism

1854
00:39:18,109 --> 00:39:18,119
one organism
 

1855
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:20,630
one organism
that started the whole thing it's more

1856
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:20,640
that started the whole thing it's more
 

1857
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,069
that started the whole thing it's more
like a I would think of it as more like

1858
00:39:22,069 --> 00:39:22,079
like a I would think of it as more like
 

1859
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:25,069
like a I would think of it as more like
a population a group of organisms I

tweeted this I want to know the accuracy

1862
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:26,760
tweeted this I want to know the accuracy
 

1863
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:29,810
tweeted this I want to know the accuracy
of my tweet all right

1864
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:29,820
of my tweet all right
 

1865
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:31,910
of my tweet all right
um sometimes early in the morning I I

1866
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:31,920
um sometimes early in the morning I I
 

1867
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,150
um sometimes early in the morning I I
tweet very pothead like things I said uh

1868
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:35,160
tweet very pothead like things I said uh
 

1869
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:40,190
tweet very pothead like things I said uh
that we all evolved from one

1870
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:40,200
that we all evolved from one
 

1871
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:43,790
that we all evolved from one
common ancestor that was a single cell

1872
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:43,800
common ancestor that was a single cell
 

1873
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:47,750
common ancestor that was a single cell
organism 3.5 billion years ago uh

1874
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:47,760
organism 3.5 billion years ago uh
 

1875
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,250
organism 3.5 billion years ago uh
something like this

1876
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:49,260
something like this
 

1877
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:52,010
something like this
how how true is that tweet do I need to

1878
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:52,020
how how true is that tweet do I need to
 

1879
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:54,349
how how true is that tweet do I need to
delete it no there's actually correct

1880
00:39:54,349 --> 00:39:54,359
delete it no there's actually correct
 

1881
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:58,069
delete it no there's actually correct
but I mean uh I I think of course

1882
00:39:58,069 --> 00:39:58,079
but I mean uh I I think of course
 

1883
00:39:58,079 --> 00:39:59,930
but I mean uh I I think of course
there's a lot to say which is like we we

1884
00:39:59,930 --> 00:39:59,940
there's a lot to say which is like we we
 

1885
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:02,569
there's a lot to say which is like we we
don't know exactly uh but what to what

1886
00:40:02,569 --> 00:40:02,579
don't know exactly uh but what to what
 

1887
00:40:02,579 --> 00:40:04,670
don't know exactly uh but what to what
degree is that the the single organism

1888
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:04,680
degree is that the the single organism
 

1889
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,950
degree is that the the single organism
aspect is that true

1890
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:06,960
aspect is that true
 

1891
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,910
aspect is that true
um versus multiple organisms no

1892
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:10,920
um versus multiple organisms no
 

1893
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:16,750
um versus multiple organisms no
totally honest yes please

1894
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:16,760

 

1895
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:19,609

this is how we did like caveats the

1896
00:40:19,609 --> 00:40:19,619
this is how we did like caveats the
 

1897
00:40:19,619 --> 00:40:22,250
this is how we did like caveats the
tweets right so first of all it's not

1898
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:22,260
tweets right so first of all it's not
 

1899
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:24,890
tweets right so first of all it's not
um 3.5 is still a very conservative

1900
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:24,900
um 3.5 is still a very conservative
 

1901
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:27,589
um 3.5 is still a very conservative
estimate that's the first Direction uh I

1902
00:40:27,589 --> 00:40:27,599
estimate that's the first Direction uh I
 

1903
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:31,069
estimate that's the first Direction uh I
would say it's 3.8 is probably safer to

1904
00:40:31,069 --> 00:40:31,079
would say it's 3.8 is probably safer to
 

1905
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:33,290
would say it's 3.8 is probably safer to
say at this point a bunch of people said

1906
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:33,300
say at this point a bunch of people said
 

1907
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,329
say at this point a bunch of people said
it probably way before if you put an

1908
00:40:35,329 --> 00:40:35,339
it probably way before if you put an
 

1909
00:40:35,339 --> 00:40:37,910
it probably way before if you put an
approximately I'll take that I didn't I

1910
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:37,920
approximately I'll take that I didn't I
 

1911
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,609
approximately I'll take that I didn't I
just love the idea

1912
00:40:39,609 --> 00:40:39,619
just love the idea
 

1913
00:40:39,619 --> 00:40:43,970
just love the idea
that I was once first of all as a single

1914
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:43,980
that I was once first of all as a single
 

1915
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:46,670
that I was once first of all as a single
organism I was once a cell well your

still is you're a group of cells no but

1918
00:40:49,609 --> 00:40:49,619
still is you're a group of cells no but
 

1919
00:40:49,619 --> 00:40:51,890
still is you're a group of cells no but
I started from a single cell

1923
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,970

00:40:57,970 --> 00:40:57,980
you relating to Luca right now
 

1925
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:00,470

1931
00:41:04,859 --> 00:41:08,150
it's like it like built up with stuff
okay that and then so that's a first

1932
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:08,160
okay that and then so that's a first
 

1933

Twitter yeah so and it's amazing that

1960
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:46,320
Twitter yeah so and it's amazing that
 

1961
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,770
Twitter yeah so and it's amazing that
this intelligence to the degree you can

00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,510
this intelligence to the degree you can
call it intelligence emerged to be able

it's almost intelligence at the chemical

1968
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:55,380
it's almost intelligence at the chemical
 

1969
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:58,790
it's almost intelligence at the chemical
level and this is also probably one of

1970
00:41:58,790 --> 00:41:58,800
level and this is also probably one of
 

1971
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,670
level and this is also probably one of
the first chemically intelligent system

1972
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:01,680
the first chemically intelligent system
 

1973
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,370
the first chemically intelligent system
that evolved by itself in nature yeah

1974
00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:04,380
that evolved by itself in nature yeah
 

1975
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:06,710
that evolved by itself in nature yeah
you see you see that translation is in a

1976
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:06,720
you see you see that translation is in a

sophisticated sort of informatic
 

1989
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:31,190

um processing system like this you may

1990
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:31,200
um processing system like this you may
 

1991
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,310
um processing system like this you may
ask yourself what might chemical systems

1992
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:34,320
ask yourself what might chemical systems
 

1993
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:38,390
ask yourself what might chemical systems
be capable of independently doing under

be capable of independently doing under
 

1995
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,730
be capable of independently doing under
different circumstances

different circumstances
 

1997
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:43,490
different circumstances
yeah so like locally they're intelligent

1998
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:43,500
yeah so like locally they're intelligent
 

1999
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,230
yeah so like locally they're intelligent
locally they don't need the rest of the

00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:45,240
locally they don't need the rest of the
 

2001
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,730
locally they don't need the rest of the
shebang like they don't need the big

2002
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:46,740
shebang like they don't need the big
 

2003
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:50,329
shebang like they don't need the big
they need so that that's that's a great

2004
00:42:50,329 --> 00:42:50,339
they need so that that's that's a great
 

2005
00:42:50,339 --> 00:42:52,849
they need so that that's that's a great

right the the hearts of the cellular

2008
00:42:55,849 --> 00:42:55,859
right the the hearts of the cellular
 

2009
00:42:55,859 --> 00:42:57,890
right the the hearts of the cellular
activities are translation you kill

2010
00:42:57,890 --> 00:42:57,900
activities are translation you kill
 

2011
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:59,930
activities are translation you kill
translation you kill the cell yes you

2012
00:42:59,930 --> 00:42:59,940
translation you kill the cell yes you
 

2013
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:03,130
translation you kill the cell yes you
not only the translation itself you kill

2014
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:03,140
not only the translation itself you kill
 

2015
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:05,930
not only the translation itself you kill
the component that initiates that you

2016
00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:05,940
the component that initiates that you
 

2017
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:07,849
the component that initiates that you
kill the cell you kill you remove the

2018
00:43:07,849 --> 00:43:07,859
kill the cell you kill you remove the
 

2019
00:43:07,859 --> 00:43:09,770
kill the cell you kill you remove the
component that elongates it you kill the

2020
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:09,780
component that elongates it you kill the
 

2021
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:11,809
component that elongates it you kill the
cell so there are many different ways to

2022
00:43:11,809 --> 00:43:11,819
cell so there are many different ways to
 

2023
00:43:11,819 --> 00:43:14,089
cell so there are many different ways to
disrupt this Machinery they all depart

2024
00:43:14,089 --> 00:43:14,099
disrupt this Machinery they all depart
 

2025
00:43:14,099 --> 00:43:17,329
disrupt this Machinery they all depart
all the parts are important now it it

2026
00:43:17,329 --> 00:43:17,339
all the parts are important now it it
 

2027
00:43:17,339 --> 00:43:19,849
all the parts are important now it it
can vary across different organisms we

2028
00:43:19,849 --> 00:43:19,859
can vary across different organisms we
 

2029
00:43:19,859 --> 00:43:22,069
can vary across different organisms we
see variation between bacteria versus

00:43:22,069 --> 00:43:22,079
see variation between bacteria versus
 

2031
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:24,470
see variation between bacteria versus
eukaryotes versus archaea right so it is

2032
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:24,480
eukaryotes versus archaea right so it is
 

2033
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:28,609
eukaryotes versus archaea right so it is
not the same same exact steps but it can

2034
00:43:28,609 --> 00:43:28,619
not the same same exact steps but it can
 

2035
00:43:28,619 --> 00:43:31,130
not the same same exact steps but it can
get more crowded as we get closer to

2036
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:31,140
get more crowded as we get closer to
 

2037
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:33,470
get more crowded as we get closer to
eukaryotes for instance but you are

00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:39,720
is this is what you're generating every
 

2045
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:42,530
is this is what you're generating every
second the single Machinery is doing 20

a second 20s 21 for bacteria I believe

2048
00:43:45,410 --> 00:43:45,420
a second 20s 21 for bacteria I believe
 

2049
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:48,650
a second 20s 21 for bacteria I believe
eight four eukaryotes or nine 21 a

eight four eukaryotes or nine 21 a
 

2051
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:50,990
eight four eukaryotes or nine 21 a
second I mean that's super inefficient

2052
00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:51,000
second I mean that's super inefficient
 

2053
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,430
second I mean that's super inefficient
or super efficient depending on how you

2054
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:52,440
or super efficient depending on how you
 

2055
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:53,690
or super efficient depending on how you
think about it

2056
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:53,700
think about it
 

2057
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:56,030
think about it
I think it's great I mean I can yeah but

2058
00:43:56,030 --> 00:43:56,040
I think it's great I mean I can yeah but
 

2059
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:58,130
I think it's great I mean I can yeah but
it's way slower than a computer

2060
00:43:58,130 --> 00:43:58,140
it's way slower than a computer
 

2061
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:00,710
it's way slower than a computer
could generate it through simulation I I

2062
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:00,720
could generate it through simulation I I
 

2063
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,109
could generate it through simulation I I
think if you can show me a computer that

2064
00:44:03,109 --> 00:44:03,119
think if you can show me a computer that
 

2065
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:05,510
think if you can show me a computer that
does this we are down here well this is

00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:05,520
does this we are down here well this is
 

2067
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,870
does this we are down here well this is
the big this includes the five things

2068
00:44:07,870 --> 00:44:07,880
the big this includes the five things
 

2069
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:10,190
the big this includes the five things
not just but I could show you a computer

2070
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:10,200
not just but I could show you a computer
 

2071
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,950
not just but I could show you a computer
that's doing the informatic right like

2072
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:12,960
that's doing the informatic right like
 

2073
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,170
that's doing the informatic right like
yes you can show me that but you cannot

2074
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:15,180
yes you can show me that but you cannot
 

2075
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:18,109
yes you can show me that but you cannot
show me the one that has all for now for

2076
00:44:18,109 --> 00:44:18,119
show me the one that has all for now for
 

2077
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:20,569
show me the one that has all for now for
now I will ask you about probably what

2078
00:44:20,569 --> 00:44:20,579
now I will ask you about probably what
 

2079
00:44:20,579 --> 00:44:23,750
now I will ask you about probably what
uh Alpha fold right uh I think the more

2080
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:23,760
uh Alpha fold right uh I think the more
 

2081
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,910
uh Alpha fold right uh I think the more
we learn about and this is why early

2082
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:25,920
we learn about and this is why early
 

2083
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,910
we learn about and this is why early
life and origin is also very fascinating

2084
00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:28,920
life and origin is also very fascinating
 

2085
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,770
life and origin is also very fascinating
and applicable to many different

2086
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:30,780
and applicable to many different
 

2087
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:34,010
and applicable to many different
disciplines there's no way you see this

2088
00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:34,020
disciplines there's no way you see this
 

2089
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:36,230
disciplines there's no way you see this
the way we just described it unless you

2090
00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:36,240
the way we just described it unless you
 

2091
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,270
the way we just described it unless you
think about early life and early

2092
00:44:38,270 --> 00:44:38,280
think about early life and early
 

2093
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:41,930
think about early life and early
geochemistry and earliest emergent

2094
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:41,940
geochemistry and earliest emergent
 

2095
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:45,890
geochemistry and earliest emergent
systems but going going back to

2096
00:44:45,890 --> 00:44:45,900
systems but going going back to
 

2097
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:48,490
systems but going going back to
the biological components

2098
00:44:48,490 --> 00:44:48,500
the biological components
 

2099
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:51,829
the biological components
all of these attributes that we think

2100
00:44:51,829 --> 00:44:51,839
all of these attributes that we think
 

2101
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:55,010
all of these attributes that we think
about life or that we associate with

2102
00:44:55,010 --> 00:44:55,020
about life or that we associate with
 

2103
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:58,609
about life or that we associate with
Biology stems from translation and as

2104
00:44:58,609 --> 00:44:58,619
Biology stems from translation and as
 

2105
00:44:58,619 --> 00:45:01,370
Biology stems from translation and as
well as metabolism but

2106
00:45:01,370 --> 00:45:01,380
well as metabolism but
 

2107
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:03,470
well as metabolism but
I see metabolism as a way to keep

2108
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:03,480
I see metabolism as a way to keep
 

2109
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,630
I see metabolism as a way to keep
translation going and translation keeps

2110
00:45:05,630 --> 00:45:05,640
translation going and translation keeps
 

2111
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:08,870
translation going and translation keeps
metabolism going but transition is

2112
00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:08,880
metabolism going but transition is
 

2113
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,550
metabolism going but transition is
arguably a bit more sophisticated

2114
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:10,560
arguably a bit more sophisticated
 

2115
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,550
arguably a bit more sophisticated
process for the reasons that I just

2116
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:13,560
process for the reasons that I just
 

2117
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:15,650
process for the reasons that I just
described so metabolism is a source of

2118
00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:15,660
described so metabolism is a source of
 

2119
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:17,690
described so metabolism is a source of
energy for this translation process it's

2120
00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:17,700
energy for this translation process it's
 

2121
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:19,790
energy for this translation process it's
so it's a it's a way to process

2122
00:45:19,790 --> 00:45:19,800
so it's a it's a way to process
 

2123
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:23,210
so it's a it's a way to process
materials and it is inherently Dynamic

2124
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:23,220
materials and it is inherently Dynamic
 

2125
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:26,870
materials and it is inherently Dynamic
and it is flexible but it is not focused

2126
00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:26,880
and it is flexible but it is not focused
 

2127
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,690
and it is flexible but it is not focused
on rapid reputation as translation does

2128
00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:29,700
on rapid reputation as translation does
 

2129
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:30,829
on rapid reputation as translation does
so that's the main difference

2130
00:45:30,829 --> 00:45:30,839
so that's the main difference
 

2131
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:33,170
so that's the main difference
translation is the kind of in a way just

2132
00:45:33,170 --> 00:45:33,180
translation is the kind of in a way just
 

2133
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:35,150
translation is the kind of in a way just
it repeats right so you have the

2134
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:35,160
it repeats right so you have the
 

2135
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:37,430
it repeats right so you have the
metabolism that can synthesize materials

2136
00:45:37,430 --> 00:45:37,440
metabolism that can synthesize materials
 

2137
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:40,609
metabolism that can synthesize materials
it creates or benefits from available

2138
00:45:40,609 --> 00:45:40,619
it creates or benefits from available
 

2139
00:45:40,619 --> 00:45:44,270
it creates or benefits from available
energy and again it's a dynamic system

2140
00:45:44,270 --> 00:45:44,280
energy and again it's a dynamic system
 

2141
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:46,910
energy and again it's a dynamic system
um and then you have computation that it

2142
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:46,920
um and then you have computation that it
 

2143
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:49,250
um and then you have computation that it
that is inherently repetitive right

2144
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:49,260
that is inherently repetitive right
 

2145
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:51,069
that is inherently repetitive right
needs to carry out repetitive processes

2146
00:45:51,069 --> 00:45:51,079
needs to carry out repetitive processes
 

2147
00:45:51,079 --> 00:45:54,710
needs to carry out repetitive processes
uh it and it does the tasks and it's it

2148
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:54,720
uh it and it does the tasks and it's it
 

2149
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,690
uh it and it does the tasks and it's it
implements an algorithm but it is not

2150
00:45:56,690 --> 00:45:56,700
implements an algorithm but it is not
 

2151
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:58,910
implements an algorithm but it is not
Dynamic so you see both of those

2152
00:45:58,910 --> 00:45:58,920
Dynamic so you see both of those
 

2153
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:01,849
Dynamic so you see both of those
attributes in Translation combined it is

2154
00:46:01,849 --> 00:46:01,859
attributes in Translation combined it is
 

2155
00:46:01,859 --> 00:46:05,650
attributes in Translation combined it is
repetitive and it is dynamic and it also

2156
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:05,660
repetitive and it is dynamic and it also
 

2157
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:08,390
repetitive and it is dynamic and it also
processes this information so they are

2158
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:08,400
processes this information so they are
 

2159
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:11,150
processes this information so they are
fundamentally different I don't know if

2160
00:46:11,150 --> 00:46:11,160
fundamentally different I don't know if
 

2161
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:12,410
fundamentally different I don't know if
you can get

2162
00:46:12,410 --> 00:46:12,420
you can get
 

2163
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:16,309
you can get
um the life if you don't find a way to

2164
00:46:16,309 --> 00:46:16,319
um the life if you don't find a way to
 

2165
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:19,010
um the life if you don't find a way to
process the information around you

2166
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:19,020
process the information around you
 

2167
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:21,589
process the information around you
in a repetitive Dynamic way yeah and

2168
00:46:21,589 --> 00:46:21,599
in a repetitive Dynamic way yeah and
 

2169
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:24,710
in a repetitive Dynamic way yeah and
somehow that that's what got

2170
00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:24,720
somehow that that's what got
 

2171
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,630
somehow that that's what got
um selected maybe not selected I don't

2172
00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:26,640
um selected maybe not selected I don't
 

2173
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,010
um selected maybe not selected I don't
know if it was

2174
00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:28,020
know if it was
 

2175
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:30,109
know if it was
um accidental but that that's what it

2176
00:46:30,109 --> 00:46:30,119
um accidental but that that's what it
 

2177
00:46:30,119 --> 00:46:32,690
um accidental but that that's what it
seems to be conserved for four billion

2178
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:32,700
seems to be conserved for four billion
 

2179
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:35,450
seems to be conserved for four billion
years that that's what life established

2180
00:46:35,450 --> 00:46:35,460
years that that's what life established
 

2181
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:36,650
years that that's what life established
what's the connection between

2182
00:46:36,650 --> 00:46:36,660
what's the connection between
 

2183
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:39,290
what's the connection between
translation and the self-replication

2184
00:46:39,290 --> 00:46:39,300
translation and the self-replication
 

2185
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:42,290
translation and the self-replication
which seems to be a another weird thing

2186
00:46:42,290 --> 00:46:42,300
which seems to be a another weird thing
 

2187
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,750
which seems to be a another weird thing
that life just started doing wanting to

2188
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:44,760
that life just started doing wanting to
 

2189
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,849
that life just started doing wanting to
just replicate it I think when we truly

2190
00:46:46,849 --> 00:46:46,859
just replicate it I think when we truly
 

2191
00:46:46,859 --> 00:46:48,230
just replicate it I think when we truly
understand the answer to that question

2192
00:46:48,230 --> 00:46:48,240
understand the answer to that question
 

2193
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,849
understand the answer to that question
we may have just made ourselves live

2194
00:46:49,849 --> 00:46:49,859
we may have just made ourselves live
 

2195
00:46:49,859 --> 00:46:53,030
we may have just made ourselves live
right we I don't think we know quite how

2196
00:46:53,030 --> 00:46:53,040
right we I don't think we know quite how
 

2197
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:56,089
right we I don't think we know quite how
translation Machinery as a whole fits

2198
00:46:56,089 --> 00:46:56,099
translation Machinery as a whole fits
 

2199
00:46:56,099 --> 00:46:58,970
translation Machinery as a whole fits
into equation because so we try to

2200
00:46:58,970 --> 00:46:58,980
into equation because so we try to
 

2201
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:00,589
into equation because so we try to
understand

2202
00:47:00,589 --> 00:47:00,599
understand
 

2203
00:47:00,599 --> 00:47:04,069
understand
um ribosomes RNA how the linear

2204
00:47:04,069 --> 00:47:04,079
um ribosomes RNA how the linear
 

2205
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:06,710
um ribosomes RNA how the linear
information is processed

2206
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:06,720
information is processed
 

2207
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:07,450
information is processed
um

2208
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:07,460
um
 

2209
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:11,870
um
or the genetic code wise this codons not

2210
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:11,880
or the genetic code wise this codons not
 

2211
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:15,109
or the genetic code wise this codons not
others why 20 not more not less and we

2212
00:47:15,109 --> 00:47:15,119
others why 20 not more not less and we
 

2213
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:17,089
others why 20 not more not less and we
are sort of moving towards transition

2214
00:47:17,089 --> 00:47:17,099
are sort of moving towards transition
 

2215
00:47:17,099 --> 00:47:18,650
are sort of moving towards transition
that's that's what we're working on

2216
00:47:18,650 --> 00:47:18,660
that's that's what we're working on
 

2217
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:21,230
that's that's what we're working on
anyway uh to finally look at the

2218
00:47:21,230 --> 00:47:21,240
anyway uh to finally look at the
 

2219
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:24,050
anyway uh to finally look at the
patterns in which this system operates

2220
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:24,060
patterns in which this system operates
 

2221
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:27,349
patterns in which this system operates
itself and if you understand that you're

2222
00:47:27,349 --> 00:47:27,359
itself and if you understand that you're
 

2223
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:29,210
itself and if you understand that you're
really unlocking a very emergent

uh one of the things you didn't mention

2228
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:32,520
uh one of the things you didn't mention
 

2229
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:35,329
uh one of the things you didn't mention
is physical is there something to

2230
00:47:35,329 --> 00:47:35,339
is physical is there something to
 

2231
00:47:35,339 --> 00:47:36,710
is physical is there something to
mention about that component that's

2232
00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:36,720
mention about that component that's
 

2233
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:39,650
mention about that component that's
interesting there's actually a paper uh

2234
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:39,660
interesting there's actually a paper uh
 

2235
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:42,170
interesting there's actually a paper uh
published in 2013 I want to say the

00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,890
um if different planets in the universe
had life would the capacity would

operate at its energy maximum
 

2263
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:21,290
operate at its energy maximum
and uh and they think that it does that

2264
00:48:21,290 --> 00:48:21,300
and uh and they think that it does that
 

2265
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:23,450
and uh and they think that it does that
it actually operates at an efficiency

2266
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:23,460
it actually operates at an efficiency
 

2267
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:26,270
it actually operates at an efficiency
that is far more above and beyond a

2268
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:26,280
that is far more above and beyond a
 

2269
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,430
that is far more above and beyond a
computational system how's that possible

2270
00:48:28,430 --> 00:48:28,440
computational system how's that possible
 

2271
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:30,410
computational system how's that possible
to determine at all that you tell me

2272
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:30,420
to determine at all that you tell me
 

2273
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:32,809
to determine at all that you tell me
that's why I dropped the citation I I

2274
00:48:32,809 --> 00:48:32,819
that's why I dropped the citation I I
 

2275
00:48:32,819 --> 00:48:34,430
that's why I dropped the citation I I
found the citation it's quite an

2276
00:48:34,430 --> 00:48:34,440
found the citation it's quite an
 

2277
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:35,930
found the citation it's quite an
interesting paper it's a bit you know

2278
00:48:35,930 --> 00:48:35,940
interesting paper it's a bit you know
 

2279
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:37,930
interesting paper it's a bit you know
it's a um

2280
00:48:37,930 --> 00:48:37,940
it's a um
 

2281
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:40,790
it's a um
it's a obviously you can only calculate

2282
00:48:40,790 --> 00:48:40,800
it's a obviously you can only calculate
 

2283
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:43,609
it's a obviously you can only calculate
and infer these things but that's a good

2284
00:48:43,609 --> 00:48:43,619
and infer these things but that's a good
 

2285
00:48:43,619 --> 00:48:47,270
and infer these things but that's a good
question to ask is the life that we see

2286
00:48:47,270 --> 00:48:47,280
question to ask is the life that we see
 

2287
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,430
question to ask is the life that we see
here on Earth and life elsewhere in the

2288
00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:49,440
here on Earth and life elsewhere in the
 

2289
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:53,210
here on Earth and life elsewhere in the
universe is it using the energy most

2290
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:53,220
universe is it using the energy most
 

2291
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:56,089
universe is it using the energy most
efficiently yeah yeah it seems to be

2292
00:48:56,089 --> 00:48:56,099
efficiently yeah yeah it seems to be
 

2293
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:58,190
efficiently yeah yeah it seems to be
very efficient again if we compare to

2294
00:48:58,190 --> 00:48:58,200
very efficient again if we compare to
 

2295
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:59,950
very efficient again if we compare to
computers it seems to be incredibly

2296
00:48:59,950 --> 00:48:59,960
computers it seems to be incredibly
 

2297
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:02,329
computers it seems to be incredibly
efficient at using it I think they look

2298
00:49:02,329 --> 00:49:02,339
efficient at using it I think they look
 

2299
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:04,490
efficient at using it I think they look
at the like the theoretical Optimum for

2300
00:49:04,490 --> 00:49:04,500
at the like the theoretical Optimum for
 

2301
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,710
at the like the theoretical Optimum for
electronic devices and then try to

2302
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:06,720
electronic devices and then try to
 

2303
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:09,530
electronic devices and then try to
understand where life falls on on this

2304
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:09,540
understand where life falls on on this
 

2305
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:12,290
understand where life falls on on this
and life is certainly more efficient and

2306
00:49:12,290 --> 00:49:12,300
and life is certainly more efficient and
 

2307
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:13,910
and life is certainly more efficient and
that's ultimately the physical side how

2308
00:49:13,910 --> 00:49:13,920
that's ultimately the physical side how
 

2309
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,230
that's ultimately the physical side how
well are you using for this entire

2310
00:49:15,230 --> 00:49:15,240
well are you using for this entire
 

2311
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:18,370
well are you using for this entire
mechanism the energy available to to you

2312
00:49:18,370 --> 00:49:18,380
mechanism the energy available to to you
 

2313
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:22,430
mechanism the energy available to to you
and so given given all the resilience to

2314
00:49:22,430 --> 00:49:22,440
and so given given all the resilience to
 

2315
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:23,690
and so given given all the resilience to
errors and all that kind of stuff it

2316
00:49:23,690 --> 00:49:23,700
errors and all that kind of stuff it
 

2317
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:25,910
errors and all that kind of stuff it
seems that it's close to its maximum yep

2318
00:49:25,910 --> 00:49:25,920
seems that it's close to its maximum yep
 

2319
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:29,210
seems that it's close to its maximum yep
and this this paper aside it does seem

2320
00:49:29,210 --> 00:49:29,220
and this this paper aside it does seem
 

2321
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:31,250
and this this paper aside it does seem
that life obviously that's the

2322
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:31,260
that life obviously that's the
 

2323
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:33,890
that life obviously that's the
constraint we have on earth right is the

2324
00:49:33,890 --> 00:49:33,900
constraint we have on earth right is the
 

2325
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:35,270
constraint we have on earth right is the
amount of energy

2326
00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:35,280
amount of energy
 

2327
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:39,109
amount of energy
yeah so that's one way to Define life

2328
00:49:39,109 --> 00:49:39,119
yeah so that's one way to Define life
 

2329
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:40,490
yeah so that's one way to Define life
well

2330
00:49:40,490 --> 00:49:40,500
well
 

2331
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:43,849
well
the input is energy and the output is

2332
00:49:43,849 --> 00:49:43,859
the input is energy and the output is
 

2333
00:49:43,859 --> 00:49:45,770
the input is energy and the output is
what I don't know

2334
00:49:45,770 --> 00:49:45,780
what I don't know
 

2335
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:48,470
what I don't know
self-replicating

2336
00:49:48,470 --> 00:49:48,480
self-replicating
 

2337
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,809
self-replicating
wait how okay let's go there how do you

2338
00:49:50,809 --> 00:49:50,819
wait how okay let's go there how do you
 

2339
00:49:50,819 --> 00:49:52,970
wait how okay let's go there how do you
how do you personally Define life do you

2340
00:49:52,970 --> 00:49:52,980
how do you personally Define life do you
 

2341
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:54,670
how do you personally Define life do you
have a do you have a favorite definition

2342
00:49:54,670 --> 00:49:54,680
have a do you have a favorite definition
 

2343
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:58,190
have a do you have a favorite definition
you try to sneak up on

2344
00:49:58,190 --> 00:49:58,200
you try to sneak up on
 

2345
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,089
you try to sneak up on
um

2346
00:49:59,089 --> 00:49:59,099
um
 

2347
00:49:59,099 --> 00:50:02,089
um
is it possible I Define life

2348
00:50:02,089 --> 00:50:02,099
is it possible I Define life
 

2349
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:04,430
is it possible I Define life
on Earth I don't know it depends on what

2350
00:50:04,430 --> 00:50:04,440
on Earth I don't know it depends on what
 

2351
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:05,930
on Earth I don't know it depends on what
you are defining it for if you're

2352
00:50:05,930 --> 00:50:05,940
you are defining it for if you're
 

2353
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:08,329
you are defining it for if you're
defining it for finding different life

2354
00:50:08,329 --> 00:50:08,339
defining it for finding different life
 

2355
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:10,790
defining it for finding different life
forms then it probably needs to have

2356
00:50:10,790 --> 00:50:10,800
forms then it probably needs to have
 

2357
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,490
forms then it probably needs to have
some quantification in it so that you

2358
00:50:13,490 --> 00:50:13,500
some quantification in it so that you
 

2359
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:14,390
some quantification in it so that you
can

2360
00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:14,400
can
 

2361
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:15,069
can
um

2362
00:50:15,069 --> 00:50:15,079
um
 

2363
00:50:15,079 --> 00:50:18,530
um
use it in in whatever the mission that

2364
00:50:18,530 --> 00:50:18,540
use it in in whatever the mission that
 

2365
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:20,150
use it in in whatever the mission that
you're operating to me like it's not

2366
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:20,160
you're operating to me like it's not
 

2367
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:23,089
you're operating to me like it's not
binary it's uh this is like a seven out

2368
00:50:23,089 --> 00:50:23,099
binary it's uh this is like a seven out
 

2369
00:50:23,099 --> 00:50:27,250
binary it's uh this is like a seven out
of ten

2370
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:27,260

 

2371
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:29,990

I don't know I I don't I don't think

2372
00:50:29,990 --> 00:50:30,000
I don't know I I don't I don't think
 

2373
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,750
I don't know I I don't I don't think
that defining is that essential I think

2374
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:32,760
that defining is that essential I think
 

2375
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:35,930
that defining is that essential I think
it's a good exercise but I'm not sure if

2376
00:50:35,930 --> 00:50:35,940
it's a good exercise but I'm not sure if
 

2377
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:39,470
it's a good exercise but I'm not sure if
the if we need to agree

2378
00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:39,480
the if we need to agree
 

2379
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:41,510
the if we need to agree
um a universally defined way of

2380
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:41,520
um a universally defined way of
 

2381
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:44,270
um a universally defined way of
understanding life uh because the

2382
00:50:44,270 --> 00:50:44,280
understanding life uh because the
 

2383
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:45,710
understanding life uh because the
definition itself seems to be ever

2384
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:45,720
definition itself seems to be ever
 

2385
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:47,870
definition itself seems to be ever
evolving anyway right we have the NASA's

2386
00:50:47,870 --> 00:50:47,880
evolving anyway right we have the NASA's
 

2387
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:49,790
evolving anyway right we have the NASA's
definition it's it says

2388
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:49,800
definition it's it says
 

2389
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:53,690
definition it's it says
it has its uh minuses and pluses but it

2390
00:50:53,690 --> 00:50:53,700
it has its uh minuses and pluses but it
 

2391
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:55,790
it has its uh minuses and pluses but it
seems to be doing its job well what what

2392
00:50:55,790 --> 00:50:55,800
seems to be doing its job well what what
 

2393
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:58,250
seems to be doing its job well what what
are the different if there is a line and

2394
00:50:58,250 --> 00:50:58,260
are the different if there is a line and
 

2395
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:00,589
are the different if there is a line and
it's impossible or unproductive to

2396
00:51:00,589 --> 00:51:00,599
it's impossible or unproductive to
 

2397
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:02,990
it's impossible or unproductive to
Define that line nevertheless we know it

2398
00:51:02,990 --> 00:51:03,000
Define that line nevertheless we know it
 

2399
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,970
Define that line nevertheless we know it
when we see it

2400
00:51:04,970 --> 00:51:04,980
when we see it
 

2401
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:07,970
when we see it
is one definition that the Supreme Court

2402
00:51:07,970 --> 00:51:07,980
is one definition that the Supreme Court
 

2403
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:09,230
is one definition that the Supreme Court
likes

2404
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:09,240
likes
 

2405
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:10,849
likes
and that's a

2406
00:51:10,849 --> 00:51:10,859
and that's a
 

2407
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:13,790
and that's a
kind of an important thing to um

2408
00:51:13,790 --> 00:51:13,800
kind of an important thing to um
 

2409
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,770
kind of an important thing to um
to think about when we look about when

2410
00:51:15,770 --> 00:51:15,780
to think about when we look about when
 

2411
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:18,349
to think about when we look about when
we look at life on other planets

2412
00:51:18,349 --> 00:51:18,359
we look at life on other planets
 

2413
00:51:18,359 --> 00:51:19,790
we look at life on other planets
so

2414
00:51:19,790 --> 00:51:19,800
so
 

2415
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:23,390
so
how do we try to identify if a thing is

2416
00:51:23,390 --> 00:51:23,400
how do we try to identify if a thing is
 

2417
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:25,510
how do we try to identify if a thing is
living when we go to Mars when we go to

2418
00:51:25,510 --> 00:51:25,520
living when we go to Mars when we go to
 

2419
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:29,270
living when we go to Mars when we go to
uh the different moons in our solar

2420
00:51:29,270 --> 00:51:29,280
uh the different moons in our solar
 

2421
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:30,950
uh the different moons in our solar
system we would go outside our solar

2422
00:51:30,950 --> 00:51:30,960
system we would go outside our solar
 

2423
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:32,870
system we would go outside our solar
system to look for Life yeah on other

2424
00:51:32,870 --> 00:51:32,880
system to look for Life yeah on other
 

2425
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,870
system to look for Life yeah on other
planets it's unlikely to be a sort of a

2426
00:51:35,870 --> 00:51:35,880
planets it's unlikely to be a sort of a
 

2427
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:38,210
planets it's unlikely to be a sort of a
Smoking Gun event right it's not going

2428
00:51:38,210 --> 00:51:38,220
Smoking Gun event right it's not going
 

2429
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:40,190
Smoking Gun event right it's not going
to be hey I found this you don't think

2430
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:40,200
to be hey I found this you don't think
 

2431
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,290
to be hey I found this you don't think
so I don't think so unless you find an

2432
00:51:42,290 --> 00:51:42,300
so I don't think so unless you find an
 

2433
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:44,809
so I don't think so unless you find an
elephant on some exoplanet then I can

2434
00:51:44,809 --> 00:51:44,819
elephant on some exoplanet then I can
 

2435
00:51:44,819 --> 00:51:46,790
elephant on some exoplanet then I can
say yeah that's there's life here no but

2436
00:51:46,790 --> 00:51:46,800
say yeah that's there's life here no but
 

2437
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,549
say yeah that's there's life here no but
is there a dynamic nature to the thing

2438
00:51:49,549 --> 00:51:49,559
is there a dynamic nature to the thing
 

2439
00:51:49,559 --> 00:51:52,190
is there a dynamic nature to the thing
like uh it moves

2440
00:51:52,190 --> 00:51:52,200
like uh it moves
 

2441
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:55,910
like uh it moves
it has a membrane that looks like

2442
00:51:55,910 --> 00:51:55,920
it has a membrane that looks like
 

2443
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,430
it has a membrane that looks like
there's stuff inside it doesn't need to

2444
00:51:58,430 --> 00:51:58,440
there's stuff inside it doesn't need to
 

2445
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,710
there's stuff inside it doesn't need to
move right I mean like look at plants I

2446
00:52:00,710 --> 00:52:00,720
move right I mean like look at plants I
 

2447
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,809
move right I mean like look at plants I
mean they they grow but there are plants

2448
00:52:02,809 --> 00:52:02,819
mean they they grow but there are plants
 

2449
00:52:02,819 --> 00:52:05,210
mean they they grow but there are plants
that or can be also pretty dormant and

2450
00:52:05,210 --> 00:52:05,220
that or can be also pretty dormant and
 

2451
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:07,970
that or can be also pretty dormant and
arguably they are the most they do

2452
00:52:07,970 --> 00:52:07,980
arguably they are the most they do
 

2453
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:10,670
arguably they are the most they do
everything that is one of my

2454
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:10,680
everything that is one of my
 

2455
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:12,950
everything that is one of my
favorite professors once said that the

2456
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:12,960
favorite professors once said that the
 

2457
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,270
favorite professors once said that the
plant does everything that the giraffe

2458
00:52:14,270 --> 00:52:14,280
plant does everything that the giraffe
 

2459
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:16,970
plant does everything that the giraffe
does without moving so the movement is

2460
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:16,980
does without moving so the movement is
 

2461
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:20,329
does without moving so the movement is
not a Zen statement necessarily but at a

2462
00:52:20,329 --> 00:52:20,339
not a Zen statement necessarily but at a
 

2463
00:52:20,339 --> 00:52:22,309
not a Zen statement necessarily but at a
certain time scale the the plant does

2464
00:52:22,309 --> 00:52:22,319
certain time scale the the plant does
 

2465
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:25,069
certain time scale the the plant does
move it just moves slower yes it moves

2466
00:52:25,069 --> 00:52:25,079
move it just moves slower yes it moves
 

2467
00:52:25,079 --> 00:52:28,010
move it just moves slower yes it moves
pretty I would I would say that and it's

2468
00:52:28,010 --> 00:52:28,020
pretty I would I would say that and it's
 

2469
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:29,750
pretty I would I would say that and it's
hard to quantify this or even measure it

2470
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:29,760
hard to quantify this or even measure it
 

2471
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:34,069
hard to quantify this or even measure it
but it is a life is definitely the

2472
00:52:34,069 --> 00:52:34,079
but it is a life is definitely the
 

2473
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:37,309
but it is a life is definitely the
chemistry finding Solutions right so it

2474
00:52:37,309 --> 00:52:37,319
chemistry finding Solutions right so it
 

2475
00:52:37,319 --> 00:52:40,309
chemistry finding Solutions right so it
is chemistry exploring itself

2476
00:52:40,309 --> 00:52:40,319
is chemistry exploring itself
 

2477
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:43,490
is chemistry exploring itself
but and and maintaining this exploration

2478
00:52:43,490 --> 00:52:43,500
but and and maintaining this exploration
 

2479
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:46,010
but and and maintaining this exploration
for billions of years so okay so a

2480
00:52:46,010 --> 00:52:46,020
for billions of years so okay so a
 

2481
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:47,150
for billions of years so okay so a
planet

2482
00:52:47,150 --> 00:52:47,160
planet
 

2483
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:49,370
planet
is a bunch of chemistry

2484
00:52:49,370 --> 00:52:49,380
is a bunch of chemistry
 

2485
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:52,130
is a bunch of chemistry
and then you run it and say all right

2486
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:52,140
and then you run it and say all right
 

2487
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:55,430
and then you run it and say all right
figure out what uh what cool stuff you

2488
00:52:55,430 --> 00:52:55,440
figure out what uh what cool stuff you
 

2489
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,049
figure out what uh what cool stuff you
can come up with that's essentially what

2490
00:52:57,049 --> 00:52:57,059
can come up with that's essentially what
 

2491
00:52:57,059 --> 00:52:59,930
can come up with that's essentially what
life is given a chemistry what is the

2492
00:52:59,930 --> 00:52:59,940
life is given a chemistry what is the
 

2493
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:01,910
life is given a chemistry what is the
cool stuff I can come up with if that's

2494
00:53:01,910 --> 00:53:01,920
cool stuff I can come up with if that's
 

2495
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,890
cool stuff I can come up with if that's
that chemistry or the solutions that

2496
00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:03,900
that chemistry or the solutions that
 

2497
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:04,790
that chemistry or the solutions that
it's

2498
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:04,800
it's
 

2499
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:08,270
it's
embarks upon are maintained in a form of

2500
00:53:08,270 --> 00:53:08,280
embarks upon are maintained in a form of
 

2501
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:09,829
embarks upon are maintained in a form of
memory

2502
00:53:09,829 --> 00:53:09,839
memory
 

2503
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:12,109
memory
right so it's this you you don't just

2504
00:53:12,109 --> 00:53:12,119
right so it's this you you don't just
 

2505
00:53:12,119 --> 00:53:13,690
right so it's this you you don't just
need to have the

2506
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:13,700
need to have the
 

2507
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:17,030
need to have the
uh explore exploring chemical space but

2508
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:17,040
uh explore exploring chemical space but
 

2509
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:19,069
uh explore exploring chemical space but
you need to also maintain a memory of

2510
00:53:19,069 --> 00:53:19,079
you need to also maintain a memory of
 

2511
00:53:19,079 --> 00:53:22,490
you need to also maintain a memory of
some of those solutions for over long

2512
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:22,500
some of those solutions for over long
 

2513
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:25,430
some of those solutions for over long
periods of time so that's the memory

2514
00:53:25,430 --> 00:53:25,440
periods of time so that's the memory
 

2515
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:26,890
periods of time so that's the memory
component

2516
00:53:26,890 --> 00:53:26,900
component
 

2517
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:29,750
component
makes it more living to me because

2518
00:53:29,750 --> 00:53:29,760
makes it more living to me because
 

2519
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,270
makes it more living to me because
chemistry can always sample right so

2520
00:53:32,270 --> 00:53:32,280
chemistry can always sample right so
 

2521
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:35,569
chemistry can always sample right so
chemistry is chemistry but are you just

2522
00:53:35,569 --> 00:53:35,579
chemistry is chemistry but are you just
 

2523
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:37,250
chemistry is chemistry but are you just
constantly sampling or are you building

2524
00:53:37,250 --> 00:53:37,260
constantly sampling or are you building
 

2525
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:40,010
constantly sampling or are you building
on your former Solutions and then

2526
00:53:40,010 --> 00:53:40,020
on your former Solutions and then
 

2527
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:41,930
on your former Solutions and then
maintaining a memory of those Solutions

2528
00:53:41,930 --> 00:53:41,940
maintaining a memory of those Solutions
 

2529
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:43,730
maintaining a memory of those Solutions
over billions of years or at least

2530
00:53:43,730 --> 00:53:43,740
over billions of years or at least
 

2531
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:46,309
over billions of years or at least
that's what happened here chemistry

2532
00:53:46,309 --> 00:53:46,319
that's what happened here chemistry
 

2533
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:48,230
that's what happened here chemistry
can't build life if it's always living

2534
00:53:48,230 --> 00:53:48,240
can't build life if it's always living
 

2535
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,630
can't build life if it's always living
in the moment the physicists would be

2536
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:50,640
in the moment the physicists would be
 

2537
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:53,210
in the moment the physicists would be
very upset with you okay

2538
00:53:53,210 --> 00:53:53,220
very upset with you okay
 

2539
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:55,609
very upset with you okay
so memory could be

2540
00:53:55,609 --> 00:53:55,619
so memory could be
 

2541
00:53:55,619 --> 00:53:59,329
so memory could be
a fundamental I mean life is not just I

2542
00:53:59,329 --> 00:53:59,339
a fundamental I mean life is not just I
 

2543
00:53:59,339 --> 00:54:01,370
a fundamental I mean life is not just I
mean life is obviously the chemistry and

2544
00:54:01,370 --> 00:54:01,380
mean life is obviously the chemistry and
 

2545
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:05,630
mean life is obviously the chemistry and
physics uh leading to biology so this is

2546
00:54:05,630 --> 00:54:05,640
physics uh leading to biology so this is
 

2547
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:07,309
physics uh leading to biology so this is
not a disciplinary

2548
00:54:07,309 --> 00:54:07,319
not a disciplinary
 

2549
00:54:07,319 --> 00:54:10,309
not a disciplinary
problem of one discipline trying playing

2550
00:54:10,309 --> 00:54:10,319
problem of one discipline trying playing
 

2551
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:12,349
problem of one discipline trying playing
other discipline it's that but what what

2552
00:54:12,349 --> 00:54:12,359
other discipline it's that but what what
 

2553
00:54:12,359 --> 00:54:14,450
other discipline it's that but what what
you need to have is definitely a big

2554
00:54:14,450 --> 00:54:14,460
you need to have is definitely a big
 

2555
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:17,150
you need to have is definitely a big
chemistry is everywhere right I

2556
00:54:17,150 --> 00:54:17,160
chemistry is everywhere right I
 

2557
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:19,490
chemistry is everywhere right I
tend to think you can be a chemist you

2558
00:54:19,490 --> 00:54:19,500
tend to think you can be a chemist you
 

2559
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:20,870
tend to think you can be a chemist you
can study chemistry you can study

2560
00:54:20,870 --> 00:54:20,880
can study chemistry you can study
 

2561
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,910
can study chemistry you can study
Physics you can study geology anywhere

2562
00:54:22,910 --> 00:54:22,920
Physics you can study geology anywhere
 

2563
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:24,410
Physics you can study geology anywhere
in the universe but this is the only

2564
00:54:24,410 --> 00:54:24,420
in the universe but this is the only
 

2565
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:26,809
in the universe but this is the only
place you can study biology this is the

2566
00:54:26,809 --> 00:54:26,819
place you can study biology this is the
 

2567
00:54:26,819 --> 00:54:29,150
place you can study biology this is the
only place to be a biologist that's it

2568
00:54:29,150 --> 00:54:29,160
only place to be a biologist that's it
 

2569
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:31,609
only place to be a biologist that's it
yeah so so definitely something very

2570
00:54:31,609 --> 00:54:31,619
yeah so so definitely something very
 

2571
00:54:31,619 --> 00:54:33,470
yeah so so definitely something very
fundamental happened here and you cannot

2572
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:33,480
fundamental happened here and you cannot
 

2573
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:35,510
fundamental happened here and you cannot
take biology out of the equation if you

2574
00:54:35,510 --> 00:54:35,520
take biology out of the equation if you
 

2575
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,010
take biology out of the equation if you
want to understand how that vast

2576
00:54:37,010 --> 00:54:37,020
want to understand how that vast
 

2577
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:40,370
want to understand how that vast
chemistry space how that General

2578
00:54:40,370 --> 00:54:40,380
chemistry space how that General
 

2579
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:44,089
chemistry space how that General
sequence space got narrowed down to what

2580
00:54:44,089 --> 00:54:44,099
sequence space got narrowed down to what
 

2581
00:54:44,099 --> 00:54:47,030
sequence space got narrowed down to what
was what is available or what is used by

2582
00:54:47,030 --> 00:54:47,040
was what is available or what is used by
 

2583
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:49,910
was what is available or what is used by
life you need to understand the rules of

2584
00:54:49,910 --> 00:54:49,920
life you need to understand the rules of
 

2585
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,069
life you need to understand the rules of
selection and that's when Evolution and

2586
00:54:52,069 --> 00:54:52,079
selection and that's when Evolution and
 

2587
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:54,109
selection and that's when Evolution and
biology comes into so the rules of

2588
00:54:54,109 --> 00:54:54,119
biology comes into so the rules of
 

2589
00:54:54,119 --> 00:54:56,690
biology comes into so the rules of
natural selection operate to you on the

2590
00:54:56,690 --> 00:54:56,700
natural selection operate to you on the
 

2591
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:58,730
natural selection operate to you on the
level of biology

2592
00:54:58,730 --> 00:54:58,740
level of biology
 

2593
00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:00,790
level of biology
rules I don't know if there are any

2594
00:55:00,790 --> 00:55:00,800
rules I don't know if there are any
 

2595
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:03,589
rules I don't know if there are any
rules like that would be fascinating to

2596
00:55:03,589 --> 00:55:03,599
rules like that would be fascinating to
 

2597
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:06,230
rules like that would be fascinating to
find in terms of the biology's rules

2598
00:55:06,230 --> 00:55:06,240
find in terms of the biology's rules
 

2599
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:09,530
find in terms of the biology's rules
that's a very interesting and

2600
00:55:09,530 --> 00:55:09,540
that's a very interesting and
 

2601
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:12,170
that's a very interesting and
um it's a very fascinating area of study

2602
00:55:12,170 --> 00:55:12,180
um it's a very fascinating area of study
 

2603
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:14,150
um it's a very fascinating area of study
now and probably we will hear more about

2604
00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:14,160
now and probably we will hear more about
 

2605
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:16,910
now and probably we will hear more about
that the decades to come but if you want

2606
00:55:16,910 --> 00:55:16,920
that the decades to come but if you want
 

2607
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:20,329
that the decades to come but if you want
to go from the the broad to specific you

2608
00:55:20,329 --> 00:55:20,339
to go from the the broad to specific you
 

2609
00:55:20,339 --> 00:55:21,710
to go from the the broad to specific you
need to understand the rules of

2610
00:55:21,710 --> 00:55:21,720
need to understand the rules of
 

2611
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:23,510
need to understand the rules of
selection and that is going to come from

2612
00:55:23,510 --> 00:55:23,520
selection and that is going to come from
 

2613
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,849
selection and that is going to come from
understanding biology yes

2614
00:55:25,849 --> 00:55:25,859
understanding biology yes
 

2615
00:55:25,859 --> 00:55:28,250
understanding biology yes
well actually let me ask you about

2616
00:55:28,250 --> 00:55:28,260
well actually let me ask you about
 

2617
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:30,950
well actually let me ask you about
selection you have a paper uh on

2618
00:55:30,950 --> 00:55:30,960
selection you have a paper uh on
 

2619
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,930
selection you have a paper uh on
evolutionary stalling

2620
00:55:32,930 --> 00:55:32,940
evolutionary stalling
 

2621
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:34,790
evolutionary stalling
where you describe that evolution is not

2622
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:34,800
where you describe that evolution is not
 

2623
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,349
where you describe that evolution is not
good at multitasking

2624
00:55:36,349 --> 00:55:36,359
good at multitasking
 

2625
00:55:36,359 --> 00:55:39,530
good at multitasking
or like uh in uh populations that have

2626
00:55:39,530 --> 00:55:39,540
or like uh in uh populations that have
 

2627
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:41,809
or like uh in uh populations that have
evolved quickly I mean it's a very

2628
00:55:41,809 --> 00:55:41,819
evolved quickly I mean it's a very
 

2629
00:55:41,819 --> 00:55:43,730
evolved quickly I mean it's a very
specific thing but there could be a

2630
00:55:43,730 --> 00:55:43,740
specific thing but there could be a
 

2631
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:45,910
specific thing but there could be a
generalizable fundamental thing to this

2632
00:55:45,910 --> 00:55:45,920
generalizable fundamental thing to this
 

2633
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:48,589
generalizable fundamental thing to this
that evolution is not able to improve

2634
00:55:48,589 --> 00:55:48,599
that evolution is not able to improve
 

2635
00:55:48,599 --> 00:55:52,010
that evolution is not able to improve
multiple modules simultaneously I guess

2636
00:55:52,010 --> 00:55:52,020
multiple modules simultaneously I guess
 

2637
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:53,329
multiple modules simultaneously I guess
the question is

2638
00:55:53,329 --> 00:55:53,339
the question is
 

2639
00:55:53,339 --> 00:55:55,250
the question is
um what part of the organism does

2640
00:55:55,250 --> 00:55:55,260
um what part of the organism does
 

2641
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:58,010
um what part of the organism does
evolution quote unquote focus on to

2642
00:55:58,010 --> 00:55:58,020
evolution quote unquote focus on to
 

2643
00:55:58,020 --> 00:55:59,930
evolution quote unquote focus on to
improve yeah that was the driving

2644
00:55:59,930 --> 00:55:59,940
improve yeah that was the driving
 

2645
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:04,309
improve yeah that was the driving
question we meddled with the part where

2646
00:56:04,309 --> 00:56:04,319
question we meddled with the part where
 

2647
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:05,450
question we meddled with the part where
you shouldn't be messing up with

2648
00:56:05,450 --> 00:56:05,460
you shouldn't be messing up with
 

2649
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:08,329
you shouldn't be messing up with
translation this is the shooter should

2650
00:56:08,329 --> 00:56:08,339
translation this is the shooter should
 

2651
00:56:08,339 --> 00:56:10,730
translation this is the shooter should
not you shouldn't as I said there are

2652
00:56:10,730 --> 00:56:10,740
not you shouldn't as I said there are
 

2653
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:13,069
not you shouldn't as I said there are
many ways to break it and all life needs

2654
00:56:13,069 --> 00:56:13,079
many ways to break it and all life needs
 

2655
00:56:13,079 --> 00:56:15,470
many ways to break it and all life needs
it so one of the things your favorite

2656
00:56:15,470 --> 00:56:15,480
it so one of the things your favorite
 

2657
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:17,630
it so one of the things your favorite
things to do is to break life to see

2658
00:56:17,630 --> 00:56:17,640
things to do is to break life to see
 

2659
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:19,010
things to do is to break life to see
what happens

2660
00:56:19,010 --> 00:56:19,020
what happens
 

2661
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:22,190
what happens
it's yeah because that's how kids learn

2662
00:56:22,190 --> 00:56:22,200
it's yeah because that's how kids learn
 

2663
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:23,930
it's yeah because that's how kids learn
right so you have to break something and

2664
00:56:23,930 --> 00:56:23,940
right so you have to break something and
 

2665
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:26,329
right so you have to break something and
you see how it will then you do over and

2666
00:56:26,329 --> 00:56:26,339
you see how it will then you do over and
 

2667
00:56:26,339 --> 00:56:28,190
you see how it will then you do over and
over again to see if it will fix itself

2668
00:56:28,190 --> 00:56:28,200
over again to see if it will fix itself
 

2669
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:30,890
over again to see if it will fix itself
in the same ways yeah so that's it's our

2670
00:56:30,890 --> 00:56:30,900
in the same ways yeah so that's it's our
 

2671
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:32,630
in the same ways yeah so that's it's our
I don't know it's the most fundamental

2672
00:56:32,630 --> 00:56:32,640
I don't know it's the most fundamental
 

2673
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,730
I don't know it's the most fundamental
properties of our ourselves as human

2674
00:56:34,730 --> 00:56:34,740
properties of our ourselves as human
 

2675
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:36,470
properties of our ourselves as human
beings so if we shouldn't break

2676
00:56:36,470 --> 00:56:36,480
beings so if we shouldn't break
 

2677
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,030
beings so if we shouldn't break
translation then we should try to break

2678
00:56:38,030 --> 00:56:38,040
translation then we should try to break
 

2679
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:40,130
translation then we should try to break
it yes to see how it will repair so

2680
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:40,140
it yes to see how it will repair so
 

2681
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:42,530
it yes to see how it will repair so
which part you break I broke elongation

2682
00:56:42,530 --> 00:56:42,540
which part you break I broke elongation
 

2683
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:46,010
which part you break I broke elongation
so what's the role of elongation in this

2684
00:56:46,010 --> 00:56:46,020
so what's the role of elongation in this
 

2685
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:49,370
so what's the role of elongation in this
process so the we we have uh four steps

2686
00:56:49,370 --> 00:56:49,380
process so the we we have uh four steps
 

2687
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:52,190
process so the we we have uh four steps
of the translations initiate elongate so

2688
00:56:52,190 --> 00:56:52,200
of the translations initiate elongate so
 

2689
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:54,049
of the translations initiate elongate so
to elongate the chain of the the

2690
00:56:54,049 --> 00:56:54,059
to elongate the chain of the the
 

2691
00:56:54,059 --> 00:56:56,030
to elongate the chain of the the
information chain that you're now

2692
00:56:56,030 --> 00:56:56,040
information chain that you're now
 

2693
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:59,690
information chain that you're now
creating the peptide chain uh or let's

2694
00:56:59,690 --> 00:56:59,700
creating the peptide chain uh or let's
 

2695
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:01,910
creating the peptide chain uh or let's
say broadly polymer chain

2696
00:57:01,910 --> 00:57:01,920
say broadly polymer chain
 

2697
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:04,190
say broadly polymer chain
um and there's a termination step and

2698
00:57:04,190 --> 00:57:04,200
um and there's a termination step and
 

2699
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:06,589
um and there's a termination step and
there's the recycling so all of these

2700
00:57:06,589 --> 00:57:06,599
there's the recycling so all of these
 

2701
00:57:06,599 --> 00:57:09,349
there's the recycling so all of these
com steps are carried out by proteins

2702
00:57:09,349 --> 00:57:09,359
com steps are carried out by proteins
 

2703
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:11,290
com steps are carried out by proteins
that are also named after these steps

2704
00:57:11,290 --> 00:57:11,300
that are also named after these steps
 

2705
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:14,450
that are also named after these steps
initiation is the initiation Factor

2706
00:57:14,450 --> 00:57:14,460
initiation is the initiation Factor
 

2707
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:16,849
initiation is the initiation Factor
protein elongation is the elongated

2708
00:57:16,849 --> 00:57:16,859
protein elongation is the elongated
 

2709
00:57:16,859 --> 00:57:18,410
protein elongation is the elongated
protein

2710
00:57:18,410 --> 00:57:18,420
protein
 

2711
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:19,970

um we

2712
00:57:19,970 --> 00:57:19,980
um we
 

2713
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:20,809
um we
um

2714
00:57:20,809 --> 00:57:20,819
um
 

2715
00:57:20,819 --> 00:57:23,390
um
broke elongation

2716
00:57:23,390 --> 00:57:23,400
broke elongation
 

2717
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:26,450
broke elongation
so the cell the starting codon could

2718
00:57:26,450 --> 00:57:26,460
so the cell the starting codon could
 

2719
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:28,190
so the cell the starting codon could
still arrive to where it's supposed to

2720
00:57:28,190 --> 00:57:28,200
still arrive to where it's supposed to
 

2721
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:32,349
still arrive to where it's supposed to
go but the following information

2722
00:57:32,349 --> 00:57:32,359
go but the following information
 

2723
00:57:32,359 --> 00:57:34,730
go but the following information
couldn't get carried out because we

2724
00:57:34,730 --> 00:57:34,740
couldn't get carried out because we
 

2725
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:38,569
couldn't get carried out because we
replaced elongation with uh its own

2726
00:57:38,569 --> 00:57:38,579
replaced elongation with uh its own
 

2727
00:57:38,579 --> 00:57:42,109
replaced elongation with uh its own
ancestral version so we inserted roughly

2728
00:57:42,109 --> 00:57:42,119
ancestral version so we inserted roughly
 

2729
00:57:42,119 --> 00:57:46,430
ancestral version so we inserted roughly
a 700 million year old elongation Factor

2730
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:46,440
a 700 million year old elongation Factor

after removing the modern Gene so we

2734
00:57:53,690 --> 00:57:53,700
after removing the modern Gene so we
 

2735
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:56,690
after removing the modern Gene so we
made this ancient modern hybrid

2736
00:57:56,690 --> 00:57:56,700
made this ancient modern hybrid
 

2737
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:59,750
made this ancient modern hybrid
organism and that essentially creates in

back to the difference between Jurassic
 

2755
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:18,470

00:58:22,910 --> 00:58:22,920
we're doing it but also
 

2761
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:25,250
we're doing it but also
um we are not necessarily I think in

00:58:25,250 --> 00:58:25,260
um we are not necessarily I think in
 

2763
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:27,650
um we are not necessarily I think in
Jurassic Park they are taking and

2764
00:58:27,650 --> 00:58:27,660
Jurassic Park they are taking and
 

2765
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:29,450
Jurassic Park they are taking and
ancients or they find an ancient

2766
00:58:29,450 --> 00:58:29,460
ancients or they find an ancient
 

2767
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:31,670
ancients or they find an ancient
organism and then put in modern Gene

2768
00:58:31,670 --> 00:58:31,680
organism and then put in modern Gene
 

2769
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:33,410
organism and then put in modern Gene
inside the ancient organism in our case

2770
00:58:33,410 --> 00:58:33,420
inside the ancient organism in our case
 

2771
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:34,970
inside the ancient organism in our case
we are still working with what we got

we are still working with what we got
 

2773
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:37,970
we are still working with what we got
but putting an ancestral DNA inside the

2774
00:58:37,970 --> 00:58:37,980
but putting an ancestral DNA inside the
 

2775
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:39,710
but putting an ancestral DNA inside the
modern organisms you're like taking a

2776
00:58:39,710 --> 00:58:39,720
modern organisms you're like taking a
 

2777
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:41,809
modern organisms you're like taking a
new car and putting an old engine into

2778
00:58:41,809 --> 00:58:41,819
new car and putting an old engine into
 

2779
00:58:41,819 --> 00:58:44,930
new car and putting an old engine into
it in a way yeah yes seeing what happens

2780
00:58:44,930 --> 00:58:44,940
it in a way yeah yes seeing what happens
 

2781
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:47,210
it in a way yeah yes seeing what happens
yes but in our case it's more like a

2782
00:58:47,210 --> 00:58:47,220
yes but in our case it's more like a
 

2783
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:49,549
yes but in our case it's more like a
Transformer than just a regular car it

2784
00:58:49,549 --> 00:58:49,559
Transformer than just a regular car it
 

2785
00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:53,329
Transformer than just a regular car it
is doing things it's yeah so it's a more

2786
00:58:53,329 --> 00:58:53,339
is doing things it's yeah so it's a more
 

2787
00:58:53,339 --> 00:58:54,890
is doing things it's yeah so it's a more
complicated organism than just the car

2788
00:58:54,890 --> 00:58:54,900
complicated organism than just the car
 

2789
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:55,849
complicated organism than just the car
yeah

2790
00:58:55,849 --> 00:58:55,859
yeah
 

2791
00:58:55,859 --> 00:58:59,329
yeah
uh I got it so what is that what does

2792
00:58:59,329 --> 00:58:59,339
uh I got it so what is that what does
 

2793
00:58:59,339 --> 00:59:00,650
uh I got it so what is that what does
that teach you

2794
00:59:00,650 --> 00:59:00,660
that teach you
 

2795
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:04,010
that teach you
we

00:59:09,950 --> 00:59:09,960
didn't just put the ancient DNA we
 

2803
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:11,390
didn't just put the ancient DNA we

inserted
 

2805
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:13,309
inserted
um we sampled DNA from currently

2806
00:59:13,309 --> 00:59:13,319
um we sampled DNA from currently
 

2807
00:59:13,319 --> 00:59:15,410
um we sampled DNA from currently
existing organisms so the cousins of

2808
00:59:15,410 --> 00:59:15,420
existing organisms so the cousins of
 

2809
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:19,069
existing organisms so the cousins of
this microbe and and collected DNA

2810
00:59:19,069 --> 00:59:19,079
this microbe and and collected DNA
 

2811
00:59:19,079 --> 00:59:21,410
this microbe and and collected DNA
sequences from the cousins as well so

2812
00:59:21,410 --> 00:59:21,420
sequences from the cousins as well so
 

2813
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:24,710
sequences from the cousins as well so
both ancestor and the current cousin DNA

2814
00:59:24,710 --> 00:59:24,720
both ancestor and the current cousin DNA
 

2815
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:27,230
both ancestor and the current cousin DNA
so to speak and engineered all of these

2816
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:27,240
so to speak and engineered all of these
 

2817
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:29,329
so to speak and engineered all of these
things to the modern bacteria and

things to the modern bacteria and
 

2819
00:59:29,339 --> 00:59:32,809
things to the modern bacteria and
generated a collection of microbes that

2820
00:59:32,809 --> 00:59:32,819
generated a collection of microbes that
 

2821
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:35,990
generated a collection of microbes that
either have the ancient component or the

2830
00:59:46,910 --> 00:59:46,920
of the tree so you broke elongation
 

2831
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:49,370

00:59:58,140 --> 00:59:59,630
improve did that help yes because we

different flavors of elongation that's a
 

2875
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:41,049
different flavors of elongation that's a
very good question so

2876
01:00:41,049 --> 01:00:41,059
very good question so
 

2877
01:00:41,059 --> 01:00:43,490
very good question so
mechanistically or mechanically it's the

mechanistically or mechanically it's the
 

2879
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:45,770
mechanistically or mechanically it's the
same it's it's very conserved so all

2880
01:00:45,770 --> 01:00:45,780
same it's it's very conserved so all
 

2881
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:48,470
same it's it's very conserved so all
life elongates the same way you are it's

01:02:43,079 --> 01:02:44,750
now you strip the Machinery down to its

parts and now you're looking at the
 

2973
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:48,049
parts and now you're looking at the
parts of the parts okay and um it

2974
01:02:48,049 --> 01:02:48,059
parts of the parts okay and um it
 

2975
01:02:48,059 --> 01:02:50,150
parts of the parts okay and um it
depends uh where you're looking and how

2976
01:02:50,150 --> 01:02:50,160
depends uh where you're looking and how
 

2977
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:51,589

you're looking and what you're looking
 

2979
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:55,609
you're looking and what you're looking
at but usually we see up to 70 percent

01:02:59,390 --> 01:02:59,400
level uh conserved identity across all
 

2983
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:03,589

elongation likely existed we have good

2988
01:03:08,930 --> 01:03:08,940
elongation likely existed we have good
 

2989
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:10,789

reason to think that it existed at the
 

2991
01:03:10,799 --> 01:03:12,710
reason to think that it existed at the
dawn of life so you're looking at a 3.8

2992
01:03:12,710 --> 01:03:12,720
dawn of life so you're looking at a 3.8
 

2993
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:15,609
dawn of life so you're looking at a 3.8
billion year old mechanism

2994
01:03:15,609 --> 01:03:15,619
billion year old mechanism
 

2995
01:03:15,619 --> 01:03:18,470
billion year old mechanism
and when we look at the ancestors that

2996
01:03:18,470 --> 01:03:18,480
and when we look at the ancestors that
 

2997
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:21,950
and when we look at the ancestors that
we resurrect we see about 40 identity so

2998
01:03:21,950 --> 01:03:21,960
we resurrect we see about 40 identity so
 

2999
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:24,349
we resurrect we see about 40 identity so
the identity definitely decreases as you

3000
01:03:24,349 --> 01:03:24,359
the identity definitely decreases as you
 

3001
01:03:24,359 --> 01:03:26,470
the identity definitely decreases as you
go back in time but still 60 percent

3002
01:03:26,470 --> 01:03:26,480
go back in time but still 60 percent
 

3003
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:29,150
go back in time but still 60 percent

high level of identity that that is kept

3016
01:03:45,890 --> 01:03:45,900
high level of identity that that is kept
 

3017
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:48,349
high level of identity that that is kept
intact especially if the component is

3018
01:03:48,349 --> 01:03:48,359
intact especially if the component is
 

3019
01:03:48,359 --> 01:03:52,670
intact especially if the component is
essential for life okay so 40 and 60 70

3020
01:03:52,670 --> 01:03:52,680
essential for life okay so 40 and 60 70
 

3021
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:55,190
essential for life okay so 40 and 60 70
you said but like from Generations

3022
01:03:55,190 --> 01:03:55,200
you said but like from Generations
 

3023
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:57,770
you said but like from Generations
generation how does evolution and

3024
01:03:57,770 --> 01:03:57,780
generation how does evolution and
 

3025
01:03:57,780 --> 01:03:59,510
generation how does evolution and
presumably that's what that paper is

3026
01:03:59,510 --> 01:03:59,520
presumably that's what that paper is
 

3027
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:01,569
presumably that's what that paper is
looking at is the parts of the parts

3028
01:04:01,569 --> 01:04:01,579
looking at is the parts of the parts
 

3029
01:04:01,579 --> 01:04:07,309
looking at is the parts of the parts
so how does it uh able to say like mess

3030
01:04:07,309 --> 01:04:07,319
so how does it uh able to say like mess
 

3031
01:04:07,319 --> 01:04:09,109
so how does it uh able to say like mess
with the parts and try to come up with a

3032
01:04:09,109 --> 01:04:09,119
with the parts and try to come up with a
 

3033
01:04:09,119 --> 01:04:11,990
with the parts and try to come up with a
cooler improved version of the organism

3034
01:04:11,990 --> 01:04:12,000
cooler improved version of the organism
 

3035
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,490
cooler improved version of the organism
yeah so let me describe to you what we

3036
01:04:13,490 --> 01:04:13,500
yeah so let me describe to you what we
 

3037
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:15,650
yeah so let me describe to you what we
did in that experiment we took a

3038
01:04:15,650 --> 01:04:15,660
did in that experiment we took a
 

3039
01:04:15,660 --> 01:04:18,530
did in that experiment we took a
different we took bacteria we perturbed

3040
01:04:18,530 --> 01:04:18,540
different we took bacteria we perturbed
 

3041
01:04:18,540 --> 01:04:20,390
different we took bacteria we perturbed
the elongation in all of these with

3042
01:04:20,390 --> 01:04:20,400
the elongation in all of these with
 

3043
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:22,670
the elongation in all of these with
different variants so we had an initial

3044
01:04:22,670 --> 01:04:22,680
different variants so we had an initial
 

3045
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:23,870
different variants so we had an initial
set of

3046
01:04:23,870 --> 01:04:23,880
set of
 

3047
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:27,410
set of
um a group of bacteria that we had we

3048
01:04:27,410 --> 01:04:27,420
um a group of bacteria that we had we
 

3049
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:29,390
um a group of bacteria that we had we
then subjected these bacteria to

3050
01:04:29,390 --> 01:04:29,400
then subjected these bacteria to
 

3051
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:31,630
then subjected these bacteria to
evolution in the lab all right so we

3052
01:04:31,630 --> 01:04:31,640
evolution in the lab all right so we
 

3053
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:33,829
evolution in the lab all right so we
first of all we knew we broke it because

3054
01:04:33,829 --> 01:04:33,839
first of all we knew we broke it because
 

3055
01:04:33,839 --> 01:04:36,530
first of all we knew we broke it because
upon engineering we measured what's

3056
01:04:36,530 --> 01:04:36,540
upon engineering we measured what's
 

3057
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:38,030
upon engineering we measured what's
going on with the cell it's not growing

3058
01:04:38,030 --> 01:04:38,040
going on with the cell it's not growing
 

3059
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:39,829
going on with the cell it's not growing
as well they are not healthy we can see

3060
01:04:39,829 --> 01:04:39,839
as well they are not healthy we can see
 

3061
01:04:39,839 --> 01:04:42,349
as well they are not healthy we can see
it with our eyes we can measure it that

3062
01:04:42,349 --> 01:04:42,359
it with our eyes we can measure it that
 

3063
01:04:42,359 --> 01:04:44,270
it with our eyes we can measure it that
if they were generating an offspring

3064
01:04:44,270 --> 01:04:44,280
if they were generating an offspring
 

3065
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:46,130
if they were generating an offspring
every 20 minutes now it is 40 minutes

3066
01:04:46,130 --> 01:04:46,140
every 20 minutes now it is 40 minutes
 

3067
01:04:46,140 --> 01:04:48,049
every 20 minutes now it is 40 minutes
right so we really messed them up they

3068
01:04:48,049 --> 01:04:48,059
right so we really messed them up they
 

3069
01:04:48,059 --> 01:04:50,450
right so we really messed them up they
don't want to work with this thing they

3070
01:04:50,450 --> 01:04:50,460
don't want to work with this thing they
 

3071
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:52,370
don't want to work with this thing they
don't want each other but they need each

3072
01:04:52,370 --> 01:04:52,380
don't want each other but they need each
 

3073
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:54,470
don't want each other but they need each
other so we created that situation for

3074
01:04:54,470 --> 01:04:54,480
other so we created that situation for
 

3075
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:55,190
other so we created that situation for
them

3076
01:04:55,190 --> 01:04:55,200
them
 

3077
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:59,150
them
which is good because we want to see how

3078
01:04:59,150 --> 01:04:59,160
which is good because we want to see how
 

3079
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:02,569
which is good because we want to see how
uh we wanted to see how they will uh

3080
01:05:02,569 --> 01:05:02,579
uh we wanted to see how they will uh
 

3081
01:05:02,579 --> 01:05:05,329
uh we wanted to see how they will uh
cooperate with each other uh to fix this

3082
01:05:05,329 --> 01:05:05,339
cooperate with each other uh to fix this
 

3083
01:05:05,339 --> 01:05:07,430
cooperate with each other uh to fix this
problem because we know that that's not

3084
01:05:07,430 --> 01:05:07,440
problem because we know that that's not
 

3085
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:09,349
problem because we know that that's not
the condition that they want to live in

3086
01:05:09,349 --> 01:05:09,359
the condition that they want to live in
 

3087
01:05:09,359 --> 01:05:10,849
the condition that they want to live in
especially when they know what they can

3088
01:05:10,849 --> 01:05:10,859
especially when they know what they can
 

3089
01:05:10,859 --> 01:05:11,690
especially when they know what they can
do

3090
01:05:11,690 --> 01:05:11,700
do
 

3091
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:14,510
do
so with that we subjected these

3092
01:05:14,510 --> 01:05:14,520
so with that we subjected these
 

3093
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:17,690
so with that we subjected these
organisms to evolution in the lab that's

3094
01:05:17,690 --> 01:05:17,700
organisms to evolution in the lab that's
 

3095
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:18,950
organisms to evolution in the lab that's
uh

3096
01:05:18,950 --> 01:05:18,960
uh
 

3097
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:20,930
uh
we refer to this as experimental

3098
01:05:20,930 --> 01:05:20,940
we refer to this as experimental
 

3099
01:05:20,940 --> 01:05:24,549
we refer to this as experimental
Evolution we subject bacteria to

3100
01:05:24,549 --> 01:05:24,559
Evolution we subject bacteria to
 

3101
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:27,609
Evolution we subject bacteria to
different selection pressure

3102
01:05:27,609 --> 01:05:27,619
different selection pressure
 

3103
01:05:27,619 --> 01:05:31,069
different selection pressure
project them through bottlenecks every

3104
01:05:31,069 --> 01:05:31,079
project them through bottlenecks every
 

3105
01:05:31,079 --> 01:05:34,910
project them through bottlenecks every
day we randomly collect a handful of

3106
01:05:34,910 --> 01:05:34,920
day we randomly collect a handful of
 

3107
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:37,730
day we randomly collect a handful of
bacteria from the flask give them put

3108
01:05:37,730 --> 01:05:37,740
bacteria from the flask give them put
 

3109
01:05:37,740 --> 01:05:39,049
bacteria from the flask give them put
them in a new Fresh environment with

3110
01:05:39,049 --> 01:05:39,059
them in a new Fresh environment with
 

3111
01:05:39,059 --> 01:05:41,510
them in a new Fresh environment with
fresh food keep them in this environment

3112
01:05:41,510 --> 01:05:41,520
fresh food keep them in this environment
 

3113
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:44,150
fresh food keep them in this environment
for 24 hours until they reach a more

3114
01:05:44,150 --> 01:05:44,160
for 24 hours until they reach a more
 

3115
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:46,370
for 24 hours until they reach a more
doormat State and then we

3116
01:05:46,370 --> 01:05:46,380
doormat State and then we
 

3117
01:05:46,380 --> 01:05:48,230
doormat State and then we
subject introduce them to an even

3118
01:05:48,230 --> 01:05:48,240
subject introduce them to an even
 

3119
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:50,329
subject introduce them to an even
environment so we repeated this for

3120
01:05:50,329 --> 01:05:50,339
environment so we repeated this for
 

3121
01:05:50,339 --> 01:05:51,890
environment so we repeated this for
about it

3122
01:05:51,890 --> 01:05:51,900
about it
 

3123
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:56,329
about it
um I will say 150 days so every day not

3124
01:05:56,329 --> 01:05:56,339
um I will say 150 days so every day not
 

3125
01:05:56,339 --> 01:05:58,130
um I will say 150 days so every day not
non-stop we repeated this experiment

3126
01:05:58,130 --> 01:05:58,140
non-stop we repeated this experiment
 

3127
01:05:58,140 --> 01:06:01,910
non-stop we repeated this experiment
some kind of uh how much how many

3128
01:06:01,910 --> 01:06:01,920
some kind of uh how much how many
 

3129
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:03,109
some kind of uh how much how many
different kinds of environments are

3130
01:06:03,109 --> 01:06:03,119
different kinds of environments are
 

3131
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:05,450
different kinds of environments are
there we kept the environments into the

3132
01:06:05,450 --> 01:06:05,460
there we kept the environments into the
 

3133
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:07,010
there we kept the environments into the
same and because we had different

3134
01:06:07,010 --> 01:06:07,020
same and because we had different
 

3135
01:06:07,020 --> 01:06:08,630
same and because we had different
initial conditions we kept the

3136
01:06:08,630 --> 01:06:08,640
initial conditions we kept the
 

3137
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:10,670
initial conditions we kept the
environment constant same temperature

3138
01:06:10,670 --> 01:06:10,680
environment constant same temperature
 

3139
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:14,990
environment constant same temperature
same food same source of carbon but we

3140
01:06:14,990 --> 01:06:15,000
same food same source of carbon but we
 

3141
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:18,250
same food same source of carbon but we
created replicates for each

3142
01:06:18,250 --> 01:06:18,260
created replicates for each
 

3143
01:06:18,260 --> 01:06:21,410
created replicates for each
lineage so in some ways we created our

3144
01:06:21,410 --> 01:06:21,420
lineage so in some ways we created our
 

3145
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:24,349
lineage so in some ways we created our
own fossil record in the lab by evolving

3146
01:06:24,349 --> 01:06:24,359
own fossil record in the lab by evolving
 

3147
01:06:24,359 --> 01:06:26,630
own fossil record in the lab by evolving
and generating these flasks and every

3148
01:06:26,630 --> 01:06:26,640
and generating these flasks and every
 

3149
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:28,970
and generating these flasks and every
gen every step of the way we all saw

3150
01:06:28,970 --> 01:06:28,980
gen every step of the way we all saw
 

3151
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:32,270
gen every step of the way we all saw
froze these cells and took stocks of

3152
01:06:32,270 --> 01:06:32,280
froze these cells and took stocks of
 

3153
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:34,190
froze these cells and took stocks of
them in the in the cryo freezer how long

3154
01:06:34,190 --> 01:06:34,200
them in the in the cryo freezer how long
 

3155
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:35,750
them in the in the cryo freezer how long
does it take to go from one generation

3156
01:06:35,750 --> 01:06:35,760
does it take to go from one generation
 

3157
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:39,049
does it take to go from one generation
to the next one bacteria if you uh for E

3158
01:06:39,049 --> 01:06:39,059
to the next one bacteria if you uh for E
 

3159
01:06:39,059 --> 01:06:42,470
to the next one bacteria if you uh for E
coli it's usually 20 minutes

3160
01:06:42,470 --> 01:06:42,480
coli it's usually 20 minutes
 

3161
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:45,470
coli it's usually 20 minutes
okay great so that's the experiment

3162
01:06:45,470 --> 01:06:45,480
okay great so that's the experiment
 

3163
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:47,569
okay great so that's the experiment
that's the experiment and and you're

3164
01:06:47,569 --> 01:06:47,579
that's the experiment and and you're
 

3165
01:06:47,579 --> 01:06:50,029
that's the experiment and and you're
you're always messing it with it in the

3166
01:06:50,029 --> 01:06:50,039
you're always messing it with it in the
 

3167
01:06:50,039 --> 01:06:52,130
you're always messing it with it in the
same way for the initial it's the it's

3168
01:06:52,130 --> 01:06:52,140
same way for the initial it's the it's
 

3169
01:06:52,140 --> 01:06:53,930
same way for the initial it's the it's
the same way so we we introduced

3170
01:06:53,930 --> 01:06:53,940
the same way so we we introduced
 

3171
01:06:53,940 --> 01:06:56,809
the same way so we we introduced
variation at elongation level because

3172
01:06:56,809 --> 01:06:56,819
variation at elongation level because
 

3173
01:06:56,819 --> 01:06:59,150
variation at elongation level because
so because we um perturbed it with

3174
01:06:59,150 --> 01:06:59,160
so because we um perturbed it with
 

3175
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:00,829
so because we um perturbed it with
different elongations we found that if

3176
01:07:00,829 --> 01:07:00,839
different elongations we found that if
 

3177
01:07:00,839 --> 01:07:03,829
different elongations we found that if
we introduce a different protein that is

3178
01:07:03,829 --> 01:07:03,839
we introduce a different protein that is
 

3179
01:07:03,839 --> 01:07:06,349
we introduce a different protein that is
very different the cells don't like that

3180
01:07:06,349 --> 01:07:06,359
very different the cells don't like that
 

3181
01:07:06,359 --> 01:07:09,670
very different the cells don't like that
right so if the distance is larger the

3182
01:07:09,670 --> 01:07:09,680
right so if the distance is larger the
 

3183
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:12,829
right so if the distance is larger the
consequences also large meaning that you

3184
01:07:12,829 --> 01:07:12,839
consequences also large meaning that you
 

3185
01:07:12,839 --> 01:07:14,990
consequences also large meaning that you
hit them harder if you introduce a

3186
01:07:14,990 --> 01:07:15,000
hit them harder if you introduce a
 

3187
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,430
hit them harder if you introduce a
variant that is really foreign to them

3188
01:07:16,430 --> 01:07:16,440
variant that is really foreign to them
 

3189
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:18,410
variant that is really foreign to them
that's really distant I mean if in our

3190
01:07:18,410 --> 01:07:18,420
that's really distant I mean if in our
 

3191
01:07:18,420 --> 01:07:20,210
that's really distant I mean if in our
case it was the ancestor they really did

3192
01:07:20,210 --> 01:07:20,220
case it was the ancestor they really did
 

3193
01:07:20,220 --> 01:07:22,069
case it was the ancestor they really did
not like the ancestor but they were okay

3194
01:07:22,069 --> 01:07:22,079
not like the ancestor but they were okay
 

3195
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:24,890
not like the ancestor but they were okay
with their nearest cousin

3196
01:07:24,890 --> 01:07:24,900
with their nearest cousin
 

3197
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:27,289
with their nearest cousin
right okay great so you did vary in the

3198
01:07:27,289 --> 01:07:27,299
right okay great so you did vary in the
 

3199
01:07:27,299 --> 01:07:28,910
right okay great so you did vary in the
distance we varied it to this double

3200
01:07:28,910 --> 01:07:28,920
distance we varied it to this double
 

3201
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:30,770
distance we varied it to this double
evolutionary distance and then we kept

3202
01:07:30,770 --> 01:07:30,780
evolutionary distance and then we kept
 

3203
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:32,210
evolutionary distance and then we kept
the experiment called experimental

3204
01:07:32,210 --> 01:07:32,220
the experiment called experimental
 

3205
01:07:32,220 --> 01:07:34,370
the experiment called experimental
conditions the same and we propagated

3206
01:07:34,370 --> 01:07:34,380
conditions the same and we propagated
 

3207
01:07:34,380 --> 01:07:37,910
conditions the same and we propagated
these populations every day for 150 days

3208
01:07:37,910 --> 01:07:37,920
these populations every day for 150 days
 

3209
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:40,250
these populations every day for 150 days
and we collected

3210
01:07:40,250 --> 01:07:40,260
and we collected
 

3211
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:43,250
and we collected
um bacteria at every step of the way and

3212
01:07:43,250 --> 01:07:43,260
um bacteria at every step of the way and
 

3213
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:45,529
um bacteria at every step of the way and
looked at the sequence we wanted to

3214
01:07:45,529 --> 01:07:45,539
looked at the sequence we wanted to
 

3215
01:07:45,539 --> 01:07:47,690
looked at the sequence we wanted to
understand what sort of changes may have

3216
01:07:47,690 --> 01:07:47,700
understand what sort of changes may have
 

3217
01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:51,529
understand what sort of changes may have
happened in the genome to respond to the

3218
01:07:51,529 --> 01:07:51,539
happened in the genome to respond to the
 

3219
01:07:51,539 --> 01:07:54,410
happened in the genome to respond to the
variation that we've introduced so what

3220
01:07:54,410 --> 01:07:54,420
variation that we've introduced so what
 

3221
01:07:54,420 --> 01:07:56,210
variation that we've introduced so what
kind of changes would you be seeing

3222
01:07:56,210 --> 01:07:56,220
kind of changes would you be seeing
 

3223
01:07:56,220 --> 01:07:57,589
kind of changes would you be seeing
depending on the evolutionary distance

3224
01:07:57,589 --> 01:07:57,599
depending on the evolutionary distance
 

3225
01:07:57,599 --> 01:07:59,569
depending on the evolutionary distance
of the thing you shoved into it exactly

3226
01:07:59,569 --> 01:07:59,579
of the thing you shoved into it exactly
 

3227
01:07:59,579 --> 01:08:01,370
of the thing you shoved into it exactly
so we knew where we punched right we

3228
01:08:01,370 --> 01:08:01,380
so we knew where we punched right we
 

3229
01:08:01,380 --> 01:08:02,809
so we knew where we punched right we
punched throughout the heart right we

3230
01:08:02,809 --> 01:08:02,819
punched throughout the heart right we
 

3231
01:08:02,819 --> 01:08:05,750
punched throughout the heart right we
punched the translation so we expected

3232
01:08:05,750 --> 01:08:05,760
punched the translation so we expected
 

3233
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:08,390
punched the translation so we expected
is it going to be is a translation

3234
01:08:08,390 --> 01:08:08,400
is it going to be is a translation
 

3235
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:11,150
is it going to be is a translation
are we going to see a change that will

3236
01:08:11,150 --> 01:08:11,160
are we going to see a change that will
 

3237
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:12,829
are we going to see a change that will
translation respond to this by fixing

3238
01:08:12,829 --> 01:08:12,839
translation respond to this by fixing
 

3239
01:08:12,839 --> 01:08:16,070
translation respond to this by fixing
itself right away or will it be

3240
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:16,080
itself right away or will it be
 

3241
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:18,410
itself right away or will it be
um another outside of translation

3242
01:08:18,410 --> 01:08:18,420
um another outside of translation
 

3243
01:08:18,420 --> 01:08:19,669
um another outside of translation
something completely different a

3244
01:08:19,669 --> 01:08:19,679
something completely different a
 

3245
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:21,050
something completely different a
different module because translation

3246
01:08:21,050 --> 01:08:21,060
different module because translation
 

3247
01:08:21,060 --> 01:08:24,890
different module because translation
itself is a module or would it be within

3248
01:08:24,890 --> 01:08:24,900
itself is a module or would it be within
 

3249
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:27,110
itself is a module or would it be within
elongation it really sub protein level

3250
01:08:27,110 --> 01:08:27,120
elongation it really sub protein level
 

3251
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:30,669
elongation it really sub protein level
thing so we uh had a strategy to

3252
01:08:30,669 --> 01:08:30,679
thing so we uh had a strategy to
 

3253
01:08:30,679 --> 01:08:34,010
thing so we uh had a strategy to
identify uh the mutational pathways by

3254
01:08:34,010 --> 01:08:34,020
identify uh the mutational pathways by
 

3255
01:08:34,020 --> 01:08:37,249
identify uh the mutational pathways by
categorizing what we expected to find or

3256
01:08:37,249 --> 01:08:37,259
categorizing what we expected to find or
 

3257
01:08:37,259 --> 01:08:38,570
categorizing what we expected to find or
where

3258
01:08:38,570 --> 01:08:38,580
where
 

3259
01:08:38,580 --> 01:08:44,410
where
okay so why does it not do multitasking

3260
01:08:44,410 --> 01:08:44,420
okay so why does it not do multitasking
 

3261
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:46,610
okay so why does it not do multitasking
why is it there wasn't improving

3262
01:08:46,610 --> 01:08:46,620
why is it there wasn't improving
 

3263
01:08:46,620 --> 01:08:49,249
why is it there wasn't improving
multiple things why simultaneously it

3264
01:08:49,249 --> 01:08:49,259
multiple things why simultaneously it
 

3265
01:08:49,259 --> 01:08:51,709
multiple things why simultaneously it
turned out that what we observed in

3266
01:08:51,709 --> 01:08:51,719
turned out that what we observed in
 

3267
01:08:51,719 --> 01:08:52,849
turned out that what we observed in
general is that first of all the

3268
01:08:52,849 --> 01:08:52,859
general is that first of all the
 

3269
01:08:52,859 --> 01:08:55,669
general is that first of all the
hardware V hit the cells the more likely

3270
01:08:55,669 --> 01:08:55,679
hardware V hit the cells the more likely
 

3271
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:57,769
hardware V hit the cells the more likely
they were to respond by changes right at

3272
01:08:57,769 --> 01:08:57,779
they were to respond by changes right at
 

3273
01:08:57,779 --> 01:08:58,970
they were to respond by changes right at
where we

3274
01:08:58,970 --> 01:08:58,980
where we
 

3275
01:08:58,980 --> 01:09:01,370
where we
hit it when you say hit it you mean like

3276
01:09:01,370 --> 01:09:01,380
hit it when you say hit it you mean like
 

3277
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:03,110
hit it when you say hit it you mean like
change the something about looking over

3278
01:09:03,110 --> 01:09:03,120
change the something about looking over
 

3279
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:04,669
change the something about looking over
this hitting because we are

3280
01:09:04,669 --> 01:09:04,679
this hitting because we are
 

3281
01:09:04,679 --> 01:09:06,169
this hitting because we are
because there's breaking the cell right

3282
01:09:06,169 --> 01:09:06,179
because there's breaking the cell right
 

3283
01:09:06,179 --> 01:09:08,209
because there's breaking the cell right
I mean not breaking enough to kill it

3284
01:09:08,209 --> 01:09:08,219
I mean not breaking enough to kill it
 

3285
01:09:08,219 --> 01:09:10,490
I mean not breaking enough to kill it
but we still the

3286
01:09:10,490 --> 01:09:10,500
but we still the
 

3287
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:12,890
but we still the
they're not doing their job well so the

3288
01:09:12,890 --> 01:09:12,900
they're not doing their job well so the
 

3289
01:09:12,900 --> 01:09:16,309
they're not doing their job well so the
the bigger the evolutionary distance of

3290
01:09:16,309 --> 01:09:16,319
the bigger the evolutionary distance of
 

3291
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:18,709
the bigger the evolutionary distance of
the thing you put in there the the the

3292
01:09:18,709 --> 01:09:18,719
the thing you put in there the the the
 

3293
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:20,809
the thing you put in there the the the
the harder the hit is how you think

3294
01:09:20,809 --> 01:09:20,819
the harder the hit is how you think
 

3295
01:09:20,819 --> 01:09:22,430
the harder the hit is how you think
about it the bigger the hammer bigger

3296
01:09:22,430 --> 01:09:22,440
about it the bigger the hammer bigger
 

3297
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:24,050
about it the bigger the hammer bigger
the hammer exactly you hit it with okay

3298
01:09:24,050 --> 01:09:24,060
the hammer exactly you hit it with okay
 

3299
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:25,430
the hammer exactly you hit it with okay
if that's what it turned out to be

3300
01:09:25,430 --> 01:09:25,440
if that's what it turned out to be
 

3301
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:26,809
if that's what it turned out to be
because that's what the data told us

3302
01:09:26,809 --> 01:09:26,819
because that's what the data told us
 

3303
01:09:26,819 --> 01:09:28,249
because that's what the data told us
that if we

3304
01:09:28,249 --> 01:09:28,259
that if we
 

3305
01:09:28,259 --> 01:09:31,329
that if we
um if the variation is higher than the

3306
01:09:31,329 --> 01:09:31,339
um if the variation is higher than the
 

3307
01:09:31,339 --> 01:09:34,490
um if the variation is higher than the
consequences will also be higher in the

3308
01:09:34,490 --> 01:09:34,500
consequences will also be higher in the
 

3309
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:36,110
consequences will also be higher in the
sense that the cells will not grow as

3310
01:09:36,110 --> 01:09:36,120
sense that the cells will not grow as
 

3311
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:39,229
sense that the cells will not grow as
healthy compared to a variance that is

3312
01:09:39,229 --> 01:09:39,239
healthy compared to a variance that is
 

3313
01:09:39,239 --> 01:09:41,570
healthy compared to a variance that is
coming from a near uh or a variance that

3314
01:09:41,570 --> 01:09:41,580
coming from a near uh or a variance that
 

3315
01:09:41,580 --> 01:09:43,849
coming from a near uh or a variance that
is coming from a near revolutionary is

3316
01:09:43,849 --> 01:09:43,859
is coming from a near revolutionary is
 

3317
01:09:43,859 --> 01:09:45,650
is coming from a near revolutionary is
it is it wrong to think of this kind of

3318
01:09:45,650 --> 01:09:45,660
it is it wrong to think of this kind of
 

3319
01:09:45,660 --> 01:09:49,070
it is it wrong to think of this kind of
hitting as a um akin to a mutation

3320
01:09:49,070 --> 01:09:49,080
hitting as a um akin to a mutation
 

3321
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:51,229
hitting as a um akin to a mutation
oh no what are we supposed to learn from

3322
01:09:51,229 --> 01:09:51,239
oh no what are we supposed to learn from
 

3323
01:09:51,239 --> 01:09:53,689
oh no what are we supposed to learn from
this hitting like how how the thing

3324
01:09:53,689 --> 01:09:53,699
this hitting like how how the thing
 

3325
01:09:53,699 --> 01:09:55,850
this hitting like how how the thing
evolves after it's being hit in this way

3326
01:09:55,850 --> 01:09:55,860
evolves after it's being hit in this way
 

3327
01:09:55,860 --> 01:10:00,770
evolves after it's being hit in this way
what does that teach us because we

3328
01:10:00,770 --> 01:10:00,780

 

3329
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:01,490

um

3330

mess with this translation is this true
 

3353
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:25,669
mess with this translation is this true
because it is so conserved and so

and before those mutations happened we
 

3403
01:11:19,199 --> 01:11:21,590
and before those mutations happened we
saw another module

01:11:21,590 --> 01:11:21,600
saw another module
 

3405
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:23,630

think of cell as a web of networks right

3412
01:11:29,890 --> 01:11:29,900
think of cell as a web of networks right
 

3413
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:33,290
think of cell as a web of networks right
when we think of this as multiple almost

that maybe are not as important if you

3420
01:11:39,830 --> 01:11:39,840
that maybe are not as important if you
 

3421
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:41,510
that maybe are not as important if you
introduce a problem in the most

3422
01:11:41,510 --> 01:11:41,520
introduce a problem in the most
 

3423
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:44,330
introduce a problem in the most
populated Hub you're gonna mess up the

3424
01:11:44,330 --> 01:11:44,340
populated Hub you're gonna mess up the
 

3425
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:46,850
populated Hub you're gonna mess up the
traffic system more drastically and and

3426
01:11:46,850 --> 01:11:46,860
traffic system more drastically and and
 

3427
01:11:46,860 --> 01:11:49,550

that's what we were messing with in in

3428
01:11:49,550 --> 01:11:49,560
that's what we were messing with in in
 

3429
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:52,550
that's what we were messing with in in
the biological terms as well so when we

3430
01:11:52,550 --> 01:11:52,560
the biological terms as well so when we
 

3431
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:54,350
the biological terms as well so when we
say module like translation would be one

3432
01:11:54,350 --> 01:11:54,360
say module like translation would be one
 

3433
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:55,970
say module like translation would be one
of the most translation would be one so

3434
01:11:55,970 --> 01:11:55,980
of the most translation would be one so
 

3435
01:11:55,980 --> 01:11:57,590
of the most translation would be one so
you're basically saying when you mess

3436
01:11:57,590 --> 01:11:57,600
you're basically saying when you mess
 

3437
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:58,910
you're basically saying when you mess
with translation

3438
01:11:58,910 --> 01:11:58,920
with translation
 

3439
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:03,410

3449
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:13,790

3451
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:16,790

3453
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:19,370
reached to its own maximum it's stalled
its optimality at a certain degree so

3454
01:12:19,370 --> 01:12:19,380
its optimality at a certain degree so
 

3455
01:12:19,380 --> 01:12:22,310
its optimality at a certain degree so
you never get to a degree that is more

you never get to a degree that is more

you never get to a degree that is more

perhaps another mutation could get you
 

3461
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:28,010
perhaps another mutation could get you

still without because there is no real
urgency in the system to fix the most

3490
01:12:55,550 --> 01:12:55,560
urgency in the system to fix the most
 

3491
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:57,470
urgency in the system to fix the most
important problem and there's also not a

3492
01:12:57,470 --> 01:12:57,480
important problem and there's also not a
 

3493
01:12:57,480 --> 01:12:59,390
important problem and there's also not a
Direction

3494
01:12:59,390 --> 01:12:59,400
Direction
 

3495
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:01,850
Direction
you know maybe to you it's obvious

3496
01:13:01,850 --> 01:13:01,860
you know maybe to you it's obvious
 

3497
01:13:01,860 --> 01:13:04,310
you know maybe to you it's obvious
that's the problem but to the cell maybe

3498
01:13:04,310 --> 01:13:04,320
that's the problem but to the cell maybe
 

3499
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:06,530
that's the problem but to the cell maybe
you're the problem I'm living like you

3500
01:13:06,530 --> 01:13:06,540
you're the problem I'm living like you
 

3501
01:13:06,540 --> 01:13:08,870
you're the problem I'm living like you
said my best life like we don't I mean I

3502
01:13:08,870 --> 01:13:08,880
said my best life like we don't I mean I
 

3503
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:10,189
said my best life like we don't I mean I
guess that's the thing about evolution

3504
01:13:10,189 --> 01:13:10,199
guess that's the thing about evolution
 

3505
01:13:10,199 --> 01:13:12,649
guess that's the thing about evolution
is we don't know what the right

3506
01:13:12,649 --> 01:13:12,659
is we don't know what the right
 

3507
01:13:12,659 --> 01:13:15,410
is we don't know what the right
direction to yeah it's almost like you

3508
01:13:15,410 --> 01:13:15,420
direction to yeah it's almost like you
 

3509
01:13:15,420 --> 01:13:17,390
direction to yeah it's almost like you
can imagine that you have this mess see

3510
01:13:17,390 --> 01:13:17,400
can imagine that you have this mess see
 

3511
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:20,810
can imagine that you have this mess see
closet and um you know

3512
01:13:20,810 --> 01:13:20,820
closet and um you know
 

3513
01:13:20,820 --> 01:13:23,930
closet and um you know
happens to be an accurate representation

3514
01:13:23,930 --> 01:13:23,940
happens to be an accurate representation
 

3515
01:13:23,940 --> 01:13:26,510
happens to be an accurate representation
of my life so if you can't you you take

3516
01:13:26,510 --> 01:13:26,520
of my life so if you can't you you take
 

3517
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:27,890
of my life so if you can't you you take
a look at it and you see all the

3518
01:13:27,890 --> 01:13:27,900
a look at it and you see all the
 

3519
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:30,410
a look at it and you see all the
sweaters or you know jeans or all over

3520
01:13:30,410 --> 01:13:30,420
sweaters or you know jeans or all over
 

3521
01:13:30,420 --> 01:13:32,330
sweaters or you know jeans or all over
the place and then you look at a drawer

3522
01:13:32,330 --> 01:13:32,340
the place and then you look at a drawer
 

3523
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:34,729
the place and then you look at a drawer
that has sucks coming out of it and

3524
01:13:34,729 --> 01:13:34,739
that has sucks coming out of it and
 

3525
01:13:34,739 --> 01:13:35,810
that has sucks coming out of it and
you'd think that's the most important

3526
01:13:35,810 --> 01:13:35,820
you'd think that's the most important
 

3527
01:13:35,820 --> 01:13:37,850
you'd think that's the most important
one I'm just gonna fix that one yeah and

3528
01:13:37,850 --> 01:13:37,860
one I'm just gonna fix that one yeah and
 

3529
01:13:37,860 --> 01:13:39,350
one I'm just gonna fix that one yeah and
then you fix that one and then you think

3530
01:13:39,350 --> 01:13:39,360
then you fix that one and then you think
 

3531
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:40,550
then you fix that one and then you think
you will get to the other one but you

3532
01:13:40,550 --> 01:13:40,560
you will get to the other one but you
 

3533
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:42,530
you will get to the other one but you
don't because you just fix the most

3534
01:13:42,530 --> 01:13:42,540
don't because you just fix the most
 

3535
01:13:42,540 --> 01:13:44,209
don't because you just fix the most
important one that is the whatever that

3536
01:13:44,209 --> 01:13:44,219
important one that is the whatever that
 

3537
01:13:44,219 --> 01:13:46,610
important one that is the whatever that
was getting into your way that's what

3538
01:13:46,610 --> 01:13:46,620
was getting into your way that's what
 

3539
01:13:46,620 --> 01:13:48,169
was getting into your way that's what
really what evolution is it's quite lazy

3540
01:13:48,169 --> 01:13:48,179
really what evolution is it's quite lazy
 

3541
01:13:48,179 --> 01:13:49,970
really what evolution is it's quite lazy
it fixes a problem that seems to be the

3542
01:13:49,970 --> 01:13:49,980
it fixes a problem that seems to be the
 

3543
01:13:49,980 --> 01:13:51,770
it fixes a problem that seems to be the
most immediate and it doesn't go beyond

3544
01:13:51,770 --> 01:13:51,780
most immediate and it doesn't go beyond
 

3545
01:13:51,780 --> 01:13:53,990
most immediate and it doesn't go beyond
what it really needs to it seems like at

3546
01:13:53,990 --> 01:13:54,000
what it really needs to it seems like at
 

3547
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,370
what it really needs to it seems like at
least for our experimental setup that

3548
01:13:55,370 --> 01:13:55,380
least for our experimental setup that
 

3549
01:13:55,380 --> 01:13:58,070
least for our experimental setup that
was the case uh especially for rapidly

3550
01:13:58,070 --> 01:13:58,080
was the case uh especially for rapidly
 

3551
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:01,189
was the case uh especially for rapidly
evolving systems so like there's the

3552
01:14:01,189 --> 01:14:01,199
evolving systems so like there's the
 

3553
01:14:01,199 --> 01:14:02,510
evolving systems so like there's the
environment they're operating in pretty

3554
01:14:02,510 --> 01:14:02,520
environment they're operating in pretty
 

3555
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:05,750
environment they're operating in pretty
constrained like is there a urgency I

3556
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:05,760
constrained like is there a urgency I
 

3557
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:07,250
constrained like is there a urgency I
would think I would say that we

3558
01:14:07,250 --> 01:14:07,260
would think I would say that we
 

3559
01:14:07,260 --> 01:14:08,630
would think I would say that we
definitely constrained the environment

3560
01:14:08,630 --> 01:14:08,640
definitely constrained the environment
 

3561
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:11,930
definitely constrained the environment
it's definitely removed from their

3562
01:14:11,930 --> 01:14:11,940
it's definitely removed from their
 

3563
01:14:11,940 --> 01:14:12,970
it's definitely removed from their
natural

3564
01:14:12,970 --> 01:14:12,980
natural
 

3565
01:14:12,980 --> 01:14:15,410
natural
setup we are not evolving them in our

3566
01:14:15,410 --> 01:14:15,420
setup we are not evolving them in our
 

3567
01:14:15,420 --> 01:14:18,770
setup we are not evolving them in our
guts it's a very homogeneous system very

3568
01:14:18,770 --> 01:14:18,780
guts it's a very homogeneous system very
 

3569
01:14:18,780 --> 01:14:20,270
guts it's a very homogeneous system very
controlled controlled temperature

3570
01:14:20,270 --> 01:14:20,280
controlled controlled temperature
 

3571
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:23,209
controlled controlled temperature
controlled food controlled carbon so

3572
01:14:23,209 --> 01:14:23,219
controlled food controlled carbon so
 

3573
01:14:23,219 --> 01:14:25,130
controlled food controlled carbon so
just looking at that let me ask the the

3574
01:14:25,130 --> 01:14:25,140
just looking at that let me ask the the
 

3575
01:14:25,140 --> 01:14:27,050
just looking at that let me ask the the
Romantic question uh how did Evolution

3576
01:14:27,050 --> 01:14:27,060
Romantic question uh how did Evolution
 

3577
01:14:27,060 --> 01:14:29,750
Romantic question uh how did Evolution
create so much beautiful complex variety

3578
01:14:29,750 --> 01:14:29,760
create so much beautiful complex variety
 

3579
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:31,250
create so much beautiful complex variety
on Earth

3580
01:14:31,250 --> 01:14:31,260
on Earth
 

3581
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:34,070
on Earth
like from that you're saying that we're

3582
01:14:34,070 --> 01:14:34,080
like from that you're saying that we're
 

3583
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:35,209
like from that you're saying that we're
talking about improving different

3584
01:14:35,209 --> 01:14:35,219
talking about improving different
 

3585
01:14:35,219 --> 01:14:36,830
talking about improving different
modules but if we step back and look at

3586
01:14:36,830 --> 01:14:36,840
modules but if we step back and look at
 

3587
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:38,330
modules but if we step back and look at
the entirety of the tree of the

3588
01:14:38,330 --> 01:14:38,340
the entirety of the tree of the
 

3589
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:40,130
the entirety of the tree of the
different organisms that created all

3590
01:14:40,130 --> 01:14:40,140
different organisms that created all
 

3591
01:14:40,140 --> 01:14:42,709
different organisms that created all
throughout history the the stuff that's

3592
01:14:42,709 --> 01:14:42,719
throughout history the the stuff that's
 

3593
01:14:42,719 --> 01:14:45,290
throughout history the the stuff that's
fun to you with the the first few

3594
01:14:45,290 --> 01:14:45,300
fun to you with the the first few
 

3595
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:48,229
fun to you with the the first few
billion and the the stuff that's fun to

3596
01:14:48,229 --> 01:14:48,239
billion and the the stuff that's fun to
 

3597
01:14:48,239 --> 01:14:50,209
billion and the the stuff that's fun to
me when I watch on YouTube which is like

3598
01:14:50,209 --> 01:14:50,219
me when I watch on YouTube which is like
 

3599
01:14:50,219 --> 01:14:52,970
me when I watch on YouTube which is like
the the line versus gorilla fights and

3600
01:14:52,970 --> 01:14:52,980
the the line versus gorilla fights and
 

3601
01:14:52,980 --> 01:14:55,490
the the line versus gorilla fights and
so on uh but the whole thing is fun so

3602
01:14:55,490 --> 01:14:55,500
so on uh but the whole thing is fun so
 

3603
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:57,350
so on uh but the whole thing is fun so
with all that beautiful variety from the

3604
01:14:57,350 --> 01:14:57,360
with all that beautiful variety from the
 

3605
01:14:57,360 --> 01:15:00,350
with all that beautiful variety from the
predator and the prey uh from the

3606
01:15:00,350 --> 01:15:00,360
predator and the prey uh from the
 

3607
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:02,149
predator and the prey uh from the
self-replicating bacteria and all that

3608
01:15:02,149 --> 01:15:02,159
self-replicating bacteria and all that
 

3609
01:15:02,159 --> 01:15:05,930
self-replicating bacteria and all that
kind of stuff how to do it how is a very

3610
01:15:05,930 --> 01:15:05,940
kind of stuff how to do it how is a very
 

3611
01:15:05,940 --> 01:15:08,630
kind of stuff how to do it how is a very
difficult question especially when we

3612
01:15:08,630 --> 01:15:08,640
difficult question especially when we
 

3613
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:10,310
difficult question especially when we
don't understand

3614
01:15:10,310 --> 01:15:10,320
don't understand
 

3615
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:14,510
don't understand
um the past with Clarity at all I can

3616
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:14,520
um the past with Clarity at all I can
 

3617
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:16,729
um the past with Clarity at all I can
tell you that there seems to be very

3618
01:15:16,729 --> 01:15:16,739
tell you that there seems to be very
 

3619
01:15:16,739 --> 01:15:18,770
tell you that there seems to be very
critical innovations that happened

3620
01:15:18,770 --> 01:15:18,780
critical innovations that happened
 

3621
01:15:18,780 --> 01:15:21,950
critical innovations that happened
throughout the history of life that are

3622
01:15:21,950 --> 01:15:21,960
throughout the history of life that are
 

3623
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:23,890
throughout the history of life that are

very sophisticated singularities that

3626
01:15:27,050 --> 01:15:27,060
very sophisticated singularities that
 

3627
01:15:27,060 --> 01:15:30,169
very sophisticated singularities that
emerged once and then they set the tone

3628
01:15:30,169 --> 01:15:30,179
emerged once and then they set the tone
 

3629
01:15:30,179 --> 01:15:33,790
emerged once and then they set the tone
one of which is emergence of translation

01:15:33,790 --> 01:15:33,800
one of which is emergence of translation
 

3631
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:36,770
one of which is emergence of translation
it seems like it happened once it had to

01:15:36,770 --> 01:15:36,780
it seems like it happened once it had to
 

3633
01:15:36,780 --> 01:15:38,570
it seems like it happened once it had to
happen once seems like that's all it

01:15:56,330 --> 01:15:56,340
um emergence of
 

3647
01:15:56,340 --> 01:15:58,010
um emergence of
cyanobacteria

cyanobacteria
 

3649
01:15:58,020 --> 01:16:00,950
cyanobacteria
that's undeniably change the course of

3650
01:16:00,950 --> 01:16:00,960
that's undeniably change the course of
 

3651
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:02,510
that's undeniably change the course of
those planets

3652
01:16:02,510 --> 01:16:02,520
those planets
 

3653
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:05,649
those planets
in the subsequent aerobic

01:16:05,659 --> 01:16:08,630
in the subsequent aerobic
photosynthesis that life learned

3656
01:16:08,630 --> 01:16:08,640
photosynthesis that life learned
 

3657
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:12,229
photosynthesis that life learned
how to utilize what's available in the

3658
01:16:12,229 --> 01:16:12,239
how to utilize what's available in the
 

3659
01:16:12,239 --> 01:16:14,270
how to utilize what's available in the
environment in the most profound way

environment in the most profound way
 

3661
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:16,490
environment in the most profound way
and then you move forward you see the

3662
01:16:16,490 --> 01:16:16,500
and then you move forward you see the
 

3663
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:19,570
and then you move forward you see the
emergence of eukaryotes to the

events and then you move forward and

3668
01:16:24,709 --> 01:16:24,719
events and then you move forward and
 

3669
01:16:24,719 --> 01:16:27,649
events and then you move forward and
then comes the plants so these are I

3670
01:16:27,649 --> 01:16:27,659
then comes the plants so these are I
 

3671
01:16:27,659 --> 01:16:29,229
then comes the plants so these are I
counted I think six different things

that seems to have happened just once

3674
01:16:32,810 --> 01:16:32,820
that seems to have happened just once
 

3675
01:16:32,820 --> 01:16:35,090
that seems to have happened just once
and the singularity events in the

3676
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:35,100
and the singularity events in the
 

3677
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:37,729
and the singularity events in the
history of evolution of life on Earth so

3678
01:16:37,729 --> 01:16:37,739
history of evolution of life on Earth so
 

3679
01:16:37,739 --> 01:16:39,830
history of evolution of life on Earth so
what's really fascinating here is that

3680
01:16:39,830 --> 01:16:39,840
what's really fascinating here is that
 

3681
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:41,990
what's really fascinating here is that
there seems to be two different courses

3682
01:16:41,990 --> 01:16:42,000
there seems to be two different courses
 

3683
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,110
there seems to be two different courses
the time course Evolution or is

3684
01:16:45,110 --> 01:16:45,120
the time course Evolution or is
 

3685
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:46,610
the time course Evolution or is
operating at the molecular level right

3686
01:16:46,610 --> 01:16:46,620
operating at the molecular level right
 

3687
01:16:46,620 --> 01:16:47,930
operating at the molecular level right
we're talking about

3688
01:16:47,930 --> 01:16:47,940
we're talking about
 

3689
01:16:47,940 --> 01:16:50,090
we're talking about
seconds we're talking about mutations

3690
01:16:50,090 --> 01:16:50,100
seconds we're talking about mutations
 

3691
01:16:50,100 --> 01:16:52,070

that happen every second we're talking
 

3693
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:53,750
that happen every second we're talking
about selection that's also happening

01:16:53,750 --> 01:16:53,760
about selection that's also happening
 

3695
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:56,689
about selection that's also happening
under a minute right so that is a very

01:16:56,689 --> 01:16:56,699
under a minute right so that is a very
 

3697
01:16:56,699 --> 01:16:58,970
under a minute right so that is a very
fast process the fact that I can evolve

3698
01:16:58,970 --> 01:16:58,980
fast process the fact that I can evolve
 

3699
01:16:58,980 --> 01:17:02,390
fast process the fact that I can evolve
bacteria in a lab and I say I almost

01:17:02,390 --> 01:17:02,400
bacteria in a lab and I say I almost

150 days I mean that's pretty rapid to

3704
01:17:08,149 --> 01:17:08,159
150 days I mean that's pretty rapid to
 

3705
01:17:08,159 --> 01:17:11,090

for for a change to be seen
 

3707
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:13,790
for for a change to be seen
but then the big changes and the ones

3708
01:17:13,790 --> 01:17:13,800
but then the big changes and the ones
 

3709
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:16,310
but then the big changes and the ones
that I'm talking really big innovations

that I'm talking really big innovations
 

3711
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:18,470
that I'm talking really big innovations
that increased that cause to an increase

me ask you this question having to do

3724
01:17:31,610 --> 01:17:31,620
me ask you this question having to do
 

3725
01:17:31,620 --> 01:17:33,950
me ask you this question having to do
with my half a sleep tweet

3726
01:17:33,950 --> 01:17:33,960
with my half a sleep tweet
 

3727

with my half a sleep tweet
so saying that we all originate from one

3728

things
 

3735
01:17:44,219 --> 01:17:46,310
things
about life on Earth of course you could

3736
01:17:46,310 --> 01:17:46,320
about life on Earth of course you could
 

3737
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:48,169
about life on Earth of course you could
say there's multiple common ancestors in

3738
01:17:48,169 --> 01:17:48,179
say there's multiple common ancestors in
 

3739
01:17:48,179 --> 01:17:49,850
say there's multiple common ancestors in
the beginning multiple organisms and so

3740
01:17:49,850 --> 01:17:49,860
the beginning multiple organisms and so
 

3741
01:17:49,860 --> 01:17:52,010
the beginning multiple organisms and so
on but the other stuff that you're

3742
01:17:52,010 --> 01:17:52,020
on but the other stuff that you're
 

3743
01:17:52,020 --> 01:17:54,350
on but the other stuff that you're
talking about is these singular events

3744
01:17:54,350 --> 01:17:54,360
talking about is these singular events
 

3745

these leaps of invention throughout

3746
01:17:57,169 --> 01:17:57,179
these leaps of invention throughout

these leaps of invention throughout
evolution in history

evolution in history
 

3749
01:17:58,679 --> 01:18:00,350
evolution in history
now there's a bunch of people who were

3750
01:18:00,350 --> 01:18:00,360
now there's a bunch of people who were
 

3751
01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:01,610
now there's a bunch of people who were
commenting

3752
01:18:01,610 --> 01:18:01,620
commenting
 

3753
01:18:01,620 --> 01:18:04,370
commenting
a bit surprising to me who were

3754
01:18:04,370 --> 01:18:04,380
a bit surprising to me who were
 

3755
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:07,130
a bit surprising to me who were
basically skeptical of this idea the

3756
01:18:07,130 --> 01:18:07,140
basically skeptical of this idea the
 

3757
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:09,830
basically skeptical of this idea the
idea of well I would say Evolution

3758
01:18:09,830 --> 01:18:09,840
idea of well I would say Evolution
 

3759
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:12,350
idea of well I would say Evolution
honestly the process of evolution but

3760
01:18:12,350 --> 01:18:12,360
honestly the process of evolution but
 

3761
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:15,410
honestly the process of evolution but
when you just actually focus in on like

3762
01:18:15,410 --> 01:18:15,420
when you just actually focus in on like
 

3763
01:18:15,420 --> 01:18:18,169
when you just actually focus in on like
holy crap

3764
01:18:18,169 --> 01:18:18,179
holy crap
 

3765
01:18:18,179 --> 01:18:18,910
holy crap
um

3766
01:18:18,910 --> 01:18:18,920
um
 

3767
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:21,350
um
eukaryotes were invented holy crap

3768
01:18:21,350 --> 01:18:21,360
eukaryotes were invented holy crap
 

3769
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:24,229
eukaryotes were invented holy crap
photosynthesis was invented like those

3770
01:18:24,229 --> 01:18:24,239
photosynthesis was invented like those
 

3771
01:18:24,239 --> 01:18:26,870
photosynthesis was invented like those
are incredible inventions and also we

3772
01:18:26,870 --> 01:18:26,880
are incredible inventions and also we
 

3773
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:28,310
are incredible inventions and also we
can go to Homo sapiens think

3774
01:18:28,310 --> 01:18:28,320
can go to Homo sapiens think
 

3775
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:30,649
can go to Homo sapiens think
intelligence like where did that come

3776
01:18:30,649 --> 01:18:30,659
intelligence like where did that come
 

3777
01:18:30,659 --> 01:18:34,130
intelligence like where did that come
from it's it did these Mysteries I think

3778
01:18:34,130 --> 01:18:34,140
from it's it did these Mysteries I think
 

3779
01:18:34,140 --> 01:18:36,470
from it's it did these Mysteries I think
where that skeptical comments are coming

3780
01:18:36,470 --> 01:18:36,480
where that skeptical comments are coming
 

3781
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:39,169
where that skeptical comments are coming
from were also just a general skepticism

3782
01:18:39,169 --> 01:18:39,179
from were also just a general skepticism
 

3783
01:18:39,179 --> 01:18:41,450
from were also just a general skepticism
of science

3784
01:18:41,450 --> 01:18:41,460
of science
 

3785
01:18:41,460 --> 01:18:45,110
of science
I think from the pandemic people may be

3786
01:18:45,110 --> 01:18:45,120
I think from the pandemic people may be
 

3787
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:47,990
I think from the pandemic people may be
a failure of Institutions and so on they

3788
01:18:47,990 --> 01:18:48,000
a failure of Institutions and so on they
 

3789
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,130
a failure of Institutions and so on they
um

3790
01:18:49,130 --> 01:18:49,140
um
 

3791
01:18:49,140 --> 01:18:51,050
um
there have been a growing distrust of

3792
01:18:51,050 --> 01:18:51,060
there have been a growing distrust of
 

3793
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:53,510
there have been a growing distrust of
Science and it's not so so much that

3794
01:18:53,510 --> 01:18:53,520
Science and it's not so so much that
 

3795
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:56,689
Science and it's not so so much that
it's anti-evolution it's it's more of a

3796
01:18:56,689 --> 01:18:56,699
it's anti-evolution it's it's more of a
 

3797
01:18:56,699 --> 01:18:58,669
it's anti-evolution it's it's more of a
stepping back and saying wait a minute

3798
01:18:58,669 --> 01:18:58,679
stepping back and saying wait a minute
 

3799
01:18:58,679 --> 01:19:00,709
stepping back and saying wait a minute
maybe scientists don't have it all

3800
01:19:00,709 --> 01:19:00,719
maybe scientists don't have it all
 

3801
01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:03,649
maybe scientists don't have it all
figured out and I think

3802
01:19:03,649 --> 01:19:03,659
figured out and I think
 

3803
01:19:03,659 --> 01:19:08,750
figured out and I think
um to Steel man that case is almost a

3804
01:19:08,750 --> 01:19:08,760
um to Steel man that case is almost a
 

3805
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:10,550
um to Steel man that case is almost a
step back and to realize there's so much

3806
01:19:10,550 --> 01:19:10,560
step back and to realize there's so much
 

3807
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:13,910
step back and to realize there's so much
mystery to each of these leaps right so

3808
01:19:13,910 --> 01:19:13,920
mystery to each of these leaps right so
 

3809
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:15,770
mystery to each of these leaps right so
it makes you wonder is there something

3810
01:19:15,770 --> 01:19:15,780
it makes you wonder is there something
 

3811
01:19:15,780 --> 01:19:17,810
it makes you wonder is there something
that in 100 200 years we'll figure out

3812
01:19:17,810 --> 01:19:17,820
that in 100 200 years we'll figure out
 

3813
01:19:17,820 --> 01:19:20,810
that in 100 200 years we'll figure out
that we totally don't understand yet

3814
01:19:20,810 --> 01:19:20,820
that we totally don't understand yet
 

3815
01:19:20,820 --> 01:19:23,510
that we totally don't understand yet
like some you know there's I talked to a

3816
01:19:23,510 --> 01:19:23,520
like some you know there's I talked to a
 

3817
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:25,850
like some you know there's I talked to a
bunch of people about another mystery

3818
01:19:25,850 --> 01:19:25,860
bunch of people about another mystery
 

3819
01:19:25,860 --> 01:19:27,830
bunch of people about another mystery
which is consciousness right and there's

3820
01:19:27,830 --> 01:19:27,840
which is consciousness right and there's
 

3821
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:30,010
which is consciousness right and there's
people called pan psychists who believe

3822
01:19:30,010 --> 01:19:30,020
people called pan psychists who believe
 

3823
01:19:30,020 --> 01:19:32,750
people called pan psychists who believe
Consciousness is one of the fundamental

3824
01:19:32,750 --> 01:19:32,760
Consciousness is one of the fundamental
 

3825
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:35,209
Consciousness is one of the fundamental
laws of the universe so there could be

3826
01:19:35,209 --> 01:19:35,219
laws of the universe so there could be
 

3827
01:19:35,219 --> 01:19:37,669
laws of the universe so there could be
um you know like we have laws of physics

3828
01:19:37,669 --> 01:19:37,679
um you know like we have laws of physics
 

3829
01:19:37,679 --> 01:19:41,030
um you know like we have laws of physics
that could be something that's like a

3830
01:19:41,030 --> 01:19:41,040
that could be something that's like a
 

3831
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:43,550
that could be something that's like a
Consciousness field or something that

3832
01:19:43,550 --> 01:19:43,560
Consciousness field or something that
 

3833
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:46,010
Consciousness field or something that
permeates all matter and so like there

3834
01:19:46,010 --> 01:19:46,020
permeates all matter and so like there
 

3835
01:19:46,020 --> 01:19:48,590
permeates all matter and so like there
might be uh it's kind of like Newtonian

3836
01:19:48,590 --> 01:19:48,600
might be uh it's kind of like Newtonian
 

3837
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:51,169
might be uh it's kind of like Newtonian
physics versus general relativity like

3838
01:19:51,169 --> 01:19:51,179
physics versus general relativity like
 

3839
01:19:51,179 --> 01:19:53,570
physics versus general relativity like
we have a good understanding of how

3840
01:19:53,570 --> 01:19:53,580
we have a good understanding of how
 

3841
01:19:53,580 --> 01:19:56,149
we have a good understanding of how
things happen but we need another layer

3842
01:19:56,149 --> 01:19:56,159
things happen but we need another layer
 

3843
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:58,790
things happen but we need another layer
of understanding to fill in the gaps of

3844
01:19:58,790 --> 01:19:58,800
of understanding to fill in the gaps of
 

3845
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:01,550
of understanding to fill in the gaps of
the mysteries of it all and

3846
01:20:01,550 --> 01:20:01,560
the mysteries of it all and
 

3847
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:04,370
the mysteries of it all and
that sort of is a sobering reality that

3848
01:20:04,370 --> 01:20:04,380
that sort of is a sobering reality that
 

3849
01:20:04,380 --> 01:20:06,350
that sort of is a sobering reality that
maybe there is something we really

3850
01:20:06,350 --> 01:20:06,360
maybe there is something we really
 

3851
01:20:06,360 --> 01:20:08,090
maybe there is something we really
deeply don't understand do you have a

3852
01:20:08,090 --> 01:20:08,100
deeply don't understand do you have a
 

3853
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:10,910
deeply don't understand do you have a
sense of where the biggest mysteries

3854
01:20:10,910 --> 01:20:10,920
sense of where the biggest mysteries
 

3855
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:13,970
sense of where the biggest mysteries
here are is it the origin of life itself

3856
01:20:13,970 --> 01:20:13,980
here are is it the origin of life itself
 

3857
01:20:13,980 --> 01:20:17,030
here are is it the origin of life itself
is it the leaps

3858
01:20:17,030 --> 01:20:17,040
is it the leaps
 

3859
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:19,550
is it the leaps
that we're talking about so you you see

3860
01:20:19,550 --> 01:20:19,560
that we're talking about so you you see
 

3861
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:21,890
that we're talking about so you you see
the beauty you're fascinated about the

3862
01:20:21,890 --> 01:20:21,900
the beauty you're fascinated about the
 

3863
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:24,410
the beauty you're fascinated about the

what are the Deep Mysteries there to you

3866
01:20:30,290 --> 01:20:30,300

 

3867
01:20:30,300 --> 01:20:33,350

we are nothing but chemical systems

you can imagine but opportunities are
 

3967
01:22:31,620 --> 01:22:34,310
you can imagine but opportunities are
not

3968
01:22:34,310 --> 01:22:34,320

 

3969
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:37,790

so if people aren't understanding the

3970
01:22:37,790 --> 01:22:37,800
so if people aren't understanding the
 

3971
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:39,410
so if people aren't understanding the
importance of this is because that's a

3972
01:22:39,410 --> 01:22:39,420
importance of this is because that's a
 

3973
01:22:39,420 --> 01:22:41,330
importance of this is because that's a
lack of opportunity right there that's

3974
01:22:41,330 --> 01:22:41,340
lack of opportunity right there that's
 

3975
01:22:41,340 --> 01:22:43,370
lack of opportunity right there that's
was skipped through

3976
01:22:43,370 --> 01:22:43,380
was skipped through
 

3977
01:22:43,380 --> 01:22:44,270
was skipped through
the

3978
01:22:44,270 --> 01:22:44,280
the
 

3979
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:46,910
the
proper Education and Training then the

3980
01:22:46,910 --> 01:22:46,920
proper Education and Training then the
 

3981
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:49,010
proper Education and Training then the
delivery of my

3982
01:22:49,010 --> 01:22:49,020
delivery of my
 

3983
01:22:49,020 --> 01:22:50,990
delivery of my
Science Matters or how science actually

3984
01:22:50,990 --> 01:22:51,000
Science Matters or how science actually
 

3985
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,910
Science Matters or how science actually
works yeah but how do you even begin to

3986
01:22:52,910 --> 01:22:52,920
works yeah but how do you even begin to
 

3987
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:53,810
works yeah but how do you even begin to
uh

3988
01:22:53,810 --> 01:22:53,820
uh
 

3989
01:22:53,820 --> 01:22:57,470
uh
I seriously think about the origin of

3990
01:22:57,470 --> 01:22:57,480
I seriously think about the origin of
 

3991
01:22:57,480 --> 01:22:58,910
I seriously think about the origin of
life

3992
01:22:58,910 --> 01:22:58,920
life
 

3993
01:22:58,920 --> 01:23:00,490
life
I mean

3994
01:23:00,490 --> 01:23:00,500
I mean
 

3995
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:03,770
I mean
every problem

3996
01:23:03,770 --> 01:23:03,780
every problem
 

3997
01:23:03,780 --> 01:23:06,590
every problem
of existence of life

3998
01:23:06,590 --> 01:23:06,600
of existence of life
 

3999
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:09,590
of existence of life
has its time so I don't know if it's

4000
01:23:09,590 --> 01:23:09,600
has its time so I don't know if it's
 

4001
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:12,229
has its time so I don't know if it's
time to understand Consciousness yet we

4002
01:23:12,229 --> 01:23:12,239
time to understand Consciousness yet we
 

4003
01:23:12,239 --> 01:23:14,630
time to understand Consciousness yet we
might be a hundred years away from that

4004
01:23:14,630 --> 01:23:14,640
might be a hundred years away from that
 

4005
01:23:14,640 --> 01:23:17,270
might be a hundred years away from that
the origin of life I don't know if it's

4006
01:23:17,270 --> 01:23:17,280
the origin of life I don't know if it's
 

4007
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:19,189
the origin of life I don't know if it's
time for us to understand that yet maybe

4008
01:23:19,189 --> 01:23:19,199
time for us to understand that yet maybe
 

4009
01:23:19,199 --> 01:23:21,110
time for us to understand that yet maybe
we need to solve so many more problems

4010
01:23:21,110 --> 01:23:21,120
we need to solve so many more problems
 

4011
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:23,330
we need to solve so many more problems
along the way and so it's not the

4012
01:23:23,330 --> 01:23:23,340
along the way and so it's not the
 

4013
01:23:23,340 --> 01:23:25,850
along the way and so it's not the
competition of problems right so there

4014
01:23:25,850 --> 01:23:25,860
competition of problems right so there
 

4015
01:23:25,860 --> 01:23:27,770
competition of problems right so there
are all kinds of problems and it takes a

4016
01:23:27,770 --> 01:23:27,780
are all kinds of problems and it takes a
 

4017
01:23:27,780 --> 01:23:29,330
are all kinds of problems and it takes a
lot of people to make the world so you

4018
01:23:29,330 --> 01:23:29,340
lot of people to make the world so you
 

4019
01:23:29,340 --> 01:23:31,610
lot of people to make the world so you
will always have some interesting brain

4020
01:23:31,610 --> 01:23:31,620
will always have some interesting brain
 

4021
01:23:31,620 --> 01:23:34,070
will always have some interesting brain
in going after an interesting problem to

4022
01:23:34,070 --> 01:23:34,080
in going after an interesting problem to
 

4023
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:37,370
in going after an interesting problem to
their own the issue here is that we we

4024
01:23:37,370 --> 01:23:37,380
their own the issue here is that we we
 

4025
01:23:37,380 --> 01:23:40,130
their own the issue here is that we we
need to first of all understand that we

4026
01:23:40,130 --> 01:23:40,140
need to first of all understand that we
 

4027
01:23:40,140 --> 01:23:42,649
need to first of all understand that we
what we have going on on this planet is

4028
01:23:42,649 --> 01:23:42,659
what we have going on on this planet is
 

4029
01:23:42,659 --> 01:23:43,669
what we have going on on this planet is
pretty good

4030
01:23:43,669 --> 01:23:43,679
pretty good
 

4031
01:23:43,679 --> 01:23:46,310
pretty good
good planets are hard to find

4032
01:23:46,310 --> 01:23:46,320
good planets are hard to find
 

4033
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:48,770
good planets are hard to find
if we are alone in the universe that's

4034
01:23:48,770 --> 01:23:48,780
if we are alone in the universe that's
 

4035
01:23:48,780 --> 01:23:50,630
if we are alone in the universe that's
that's huge

4036
01:23:50,630 --> 01:23:50,640
that's huge
 

4037
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:53,270
that's huge
we need to take care of what we got here

4038
01:23:53,270 --> 01:23:53,280
we need to take care of what we got here
 

4039
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:57,470
we need to take care of what we got here
and we are incredibly vulnerable to the

4040
01:23:57,470 --> 01:23:57,480
and we are incredibly vulnerable to the
 

4041
01:23:57,480 --> 01:24:00,290
and we are incredibly vulnerable to the
changes that our own species also helped

4042
01:24:00,290 --> 01:24:00,300
changes that our own species also helped
 

4043
01:24:00,300 --> 01:24:03,350
changes that our own species also helped
create on antibiosphere at the ecosystem

4044
01:24:03,350 --> 01:24:03,360
create on antibiosphere at the ecosystem
 

4045
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:06,350
create on antibiosphere at the ecosystem
level we take it for granted we take

4046
01:24:06,350 --> 01:24:06,360
level we take it for granted we take
 

4047
01:24:06,360 --> 01:24:08,630
level we take it for granted we take
what we created for granted because of

4048
01:24:08,630 --> 01:24:08,640
what we created for granted because of
 

4049
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:10,370
what we created for granted because of
the fact that we think we are some sort

4050
01:24:10,370 --> 01:24:10,380
the fact that we think we are some sort
 

4051
01:24:10,380 --> 01:24:13,130
the fact that we think we are some sort
of ultimate endpoint the most

4052
01:24:13,130 --> 01:24:13,140
of ultimate endpoint the most
 

4053
01:24:13,140 --> 01:24:15,050
of ultimate endpoint the most
sophisticated amazing thing that nature

4054
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:15,060
sophisticated amazing thing that nature
 

4055
01:24:15,060 --> 01:24:17,149
sophisticated amazing thing that nature
could generate

4056
01:24:17,149 --> 01:24:17,159
could generate
 

4057
01:24:17,159 --> 01:24:20,570
could generate
I think understanding and not even

4058
01:24:20,570 --> 01:24:20,580
I think understanding and not even
 

4059
01:24:20,580 --> 01:24:23,030
I think understanding and not even
understanding but asking these questions

4060
01:24:23,030 --> 01:24:23,040
understanding but asking these questions
 

4061
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:26,450
understanding but asking these questions
of where did this even come from how did

4062
01:24:26,450 --> 01:24:26,460
of where did this even come from how did
 

4063
01:24:26,460 --> 01:24:30,130
of where did this even come from how did
this even begin and

4064
01:24:30,130 --> 01:24:30,140
this even begin and
 

4065
01:24:30,140 --> 01:24:32,390
this even begin and
attempting to understand that using

4066
01:24:32,390 --> 01:24:32,400
attempting to understand that using
 

4067
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:35,510
attempting to understand that using
chemistry and physics and biology and

4068
01:24:35,510 --> 01:24:35,520
chemistry and physics and biology and
 

4069
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:36,790
chemistry and physics and biology and
because we can

4070
01:24:36,790 --> 01:24:36,800
because we can
 

4071
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:39,110
because we can
That's The Ultimate Gift we can give

4072
01:24:39,110 --> 01:24:39,120
That's The Ultimate Gift we can give
 

4073
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:41,090
That's The Ultimate Gift we can give
back to the entire species on this

4074
01:24:41,090 --> 01:24:41,100
back to the entire species on this
 

4075
01:24:41,100 --> 01:24:42,229
back to the entire species on this
planet

4076
01:24:42,229 --> 01:24:42,239
planet
 

4077
01:24:42,239 --> 01:24:45,290
planet
yeah I mean it's humbling it's humbling

4078
01:24:45,290 --> 01:24:45,300
yeah I mean it's humbling it's humbling
 

4079
01:24:45,300 --> 01:24:47,330
yeah I mean it's humbling it's humbling
to realize the the complexity of this

4080
01:24:47,330 --> 01:24:47,340
to realize the the complexity of this
 

4081
01:24:47,340 --> 01:24:49,490
to realize the the complexity of this
whole mechanism it certainly puts humans

4082
01:24:49,490 --> 01:24:49,500
whole mechanism it certainly puts humans
 

4083
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:51,830
whole mechanism it certainly puts humans
in their proper perspective that we're

4084
01:24:51,830 --> 01:24:51,840
in their proper perspective that we're
 

4085
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:53,570
in their proper perspective that we're
not

4086
01:24:53,570 --> 01:24:53,580
not
 

4087
01:24:53,580 --> 01:24:54,890
not
um just because we have brains and

4088
01:24:54,890 --> 01:24:54,900
um just because we have brains and
 

4089
01:24:54,900 --> 01:24:57,950
um just because we have brains and
brains are intelligent doesn't mean

4090
01:24:57,950 --> 01:24:57,960
brains are intelligent doesn't mean
 

4091
01:24:57,960 --> 01:24:59,870
brains are intelligent doesn't mean
we're the most intelligent thing because

4092
01:24:59,870 --> 01:24:59,880
we're the most intelligent thing because
 

4093
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:01,729
we're the most intelligent thing because
ultimately the the whole mechanism of

4094
01:25:01,729 --> 01:25:01,739
ultimately the the whole mechanism of
 

4095
01:25:01,739 --> 01:25:03,770
ultimately the the whole mechanism of
nature seems to be orders and magnesium

4096
01:25:03,770 --> 01:25:03,780
nature seems to be orders and magnesium
 

4097
01:25:03,780 --> 01:25:05,570
nature seems to be orders and magnesium
more intelligent all all of it like

4098
01:25:05,570 --> 01:25:05,580
more intelligent all all of it like
 

4099
01:25:05,580 --> 01:25:07,250
more intelligent all all of it like
we're we're a bunch we're like a

4100
01:25:07,250 --> 01:25:07,260
we're we're a bunch we're like a
 

4101
01:25:07,260 --> 01:25:09,950
we're we're a bunch we're like a
hierarchy of organisms that have a

4102
01:25:09,950 --> 01:25:09,960
hierarchy of organisms that have a
 

4103
01:25:09,960 --> 01:25:12,470
hierarchy of organisms that have a
history of several billion years and

4104
01:25:12,470 --> 01:25:12,480
history of several billion years and
 

4105
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:14,209
history of several billion years and
that all somehow came together to make a

4106
01:25:14,209 --> 01:25:14,219
that all somehow came together to make a
 

4107
01:25:14,219 --> 01:25:16,970
that all somehow came together to make a
human and there'll be life after us

4108
01:25:16,970 --> 01:25:16,980
human and there'll be life after us
 

4109
01:25:16,980 --> 01:25:19,130
human and there'll be life after us
just as it was life before us and

4110
01:25:19,130 --> 01:25:19,140
just as it was life before us and
 

4111
01:25:19,140 --> 01:25:20,470
just as it was life before us and
something that comes after will be

4112
01:25:20,470 --> 01:25:20,480
something that comes after will be
 

4113
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:22,970
something that comes after will be
perhaps even more fascinating

4114
01:25:22,970 --> 01:25:22,980
perhaps even more fascinating
 

4115
01:25:22,980 --> 01:25:25,310
perhaps even more fascinating
yeah I think when you understand the

4116
01:25:25,310 --> 01:25:25,320
yeah I think when you understand the
 

4117
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:27,350
yeah I think when you understand the
magnitude of what happened here there is

4118
01:25:27,350 --> 01:25:27,360
magnitude of what happened here there is
 

4119
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:29,630
magnitude of what happened here there is
there is no room for arrogance it should

4120
01:25:29,630 --> 01:25:29,640
there is no room for arrogance it should
 

4121
01:25:29,640 --> 01:25:31,790
there is no room for arrogance it should
overwhelm you and humiliate it's pretty

4122
01:25:31,790 --> 01:25:31,800
overwhelm you and humiliate it's pretty
 

4123
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:34,669
overwhelm you and humiliate it's pretty
humiliating yeah like you know it's it's

4124
01:25:34,669 --> 01:25:34,679
humiliating yeah like you know it's it's
 

4125
01:25:34,679 --> 01:25:37,070
humiliating yeah like you know it's it's
it's quite amazing what what what was

4126
01:25:37,070 --> 01:25:37,080
it's quite amazing what what what was
 

4127
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:39,770
it's quite amazing what what what was
what happened here and there is no other

4128
01:25:39,770 --> 01:25:39,780
what happened here and there is no other
 

4129
01:25:39,780 --> 01:25:41,390
what happened here and there is no other
discipline that will

4130
01:25:41,390 --> 01:25:41,400
discipline that will
 

4131
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:45,110
discipline that will
deliver that but exploring our own

4132
01:25:45,110 --> 01:25:45,120
deliver that but exploring our own
 

4133
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:47,630
deliver that but exploring our own
Origins and looking at Life as a more

4134
01:25:47,630 --> 01:25:47,640
Origins and looking at Life as a more
 

4135
01:25:47,640 --> 01:25:50,350
Origins and looking at Life as a more
planetary system phenomena rather than

4136
01:25:50,350 --> 01:25:50,360
planetary system phenomena rather than
 

4137
01:25:50,360 --> 01:25:53,390
planetary system phenomena rather than
one single species at a time a

01:25:53,390 --> 01:25:53,400
one single species at a time a

01:25:55,330 --> 01:25:55,340
collective look
 

4141
01:25:55,340 --> 01:25:57,830
collective look
uh you mentioned this question in your

4142
01:25:57,830 --> 01:25:57,840
uh you mentioned this question in your
 

4143
01:25:57,840 --> 01:25:59,810
uh you mentioned this question in your
Ted Talk is

4144
01:25:59,810 --> 01:25:59,820
Ted Talk is
 

4145
01:25:59,820 --> 01:26:01,850
Ted Talk is
the two possibilities

4146
01:26:01,850 --> 01:26:01,860
the two possibilities
 

4147
01:26:01,860 --> 01:26:05,270
the two possibilities
of the universe being full of life

4148
01:26:05,270 --> 01:26:05,280
of the universe being full of life
 

4149
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:07,430
of the universe being full of life
and the universe being empty and we're

4150
01:26:07,430 --> 01:26:07,440
and the universe being empty and we're
 

4151
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:10,090
and the universe being empty and we're
the only life in the universe

4152
01:26:10,090 --> 01:26:10,100
the only life in the universe
 

4153
01:26:10,100 --> 01:26:13,610
the only life in the universe
how do you feel about both options

4154
01:26:13,610 --> 01:26:13,620
how do you feel about both options
 

4155
01:26:13,620 --> 01:26:16,430
how do you feel about both options
just actually you as a single chemical

4156
01:26:16,430 --> 01:26:16,440
just actually you as a single chemical
 

4157
01:26:16,440 --> 01:26:18,410
just actually you as a single chemical
organism introspecting about its

4158
01:26:18,410 --> 01:26:18,420
organism introspecting about its
 

4159
01:26:18,420 --> 01:26:22,250
organism introspecting about its
existence in this world it's having a

4160
01:26:22,250 --> 01:26:22,260
existence in this world it's having a
 

4161
01:26:22,260 --> 01:26:23,750
existence in this world it's having a
planet flow of life is interesting

4162
01:26:23,750 --> 01:26:23,760
planet flow of life is interesting
 

4163
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:26,709
planet flow of life is interesting
because there are we talked about

4164
01:26:26,709 --> 01:26:26,719
because there are we talked about
 

4165
01:26:26,719 --> 01:26:29,510
because there are we talked about
life being all about chemistry exploring

4166
01:26:29,510 --> 01:26:29,520
life being all about chemistry exploring
 

4167
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:31,910
life being all about chemistry exploring
Solutions and having Solutions in front

4168
01:26:31,910 --> 01:26:31,920
Solutions and having Solutions in front
 

4169
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:34,990
Solutions and having Solutions in front
of you is is great it's beneficial right

4170
01:26:34,990 --> 01:26:35,000
of you is is great it's beneficial right
 

4171
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,430
of you is is great it's beneficial right
Solutions being different organisms like

4172
01:26:37,430 --> 01:26:37,440
Solutions being different organisms like
 

4173
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:38,990
Solutions being different organisms like
other humans you see them as a solution

4174
01:26:38,990 --> 01:26:39,000
other humans you see them as a solution
 

4175
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,129
other humans you see them as a solution
to a chemistry problem different

4176
01:26:40,129 --> 01:26:40,139
to a chemistry problem different
 

4177
01:26:40,139 --> 01:26:42,050
to a chemistry problem different
different yeah that's an interesting

4178
01:26:42,050 --> 01:26:42,060
different yeah that's an interesting
 

4179
01:26:42,060 --> 01:26:44,209
different yeah that's an interesting
Solution that's not next time we're in

4180
01:26:44,209 --> 01:26:44,219
Solution that's not next time we're in
 

4181
01:26:44,219 --> 01:26:45,590
Solution that's not next time we're in
Austin so there's a bunch of weirdos

4182
01:26:45,590 --> 01:26:45,600
Austin so there's a bunch of weirdos
 

4183
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:47,149
Austin so there's a bunch of weirdos
every time I see a weirdo I'll be like

4184
01:26:47,149 --> 01:26:47,159
every time I see a weirdo I'll be like
 

4185
01:26:47,159 --> 01:26:49,010
every time I see a weirdo I'll be like
oh that's an interesting solution to

4186
01:26:49,010 --> 01:26:49,020
oh that's an interesting solution to
 

4187
01:26:49,020 --> 01:26:51,550
oh that's an interesting solution to
this chemistry problem

4188
01:26:51,550 --> 01:26:51,560
this chemistry problem
 

4189
01:26:51,560 --> 01:26:53,330
this chemistry problem
now you think like an origin of

4190
01:26:53,330 --> 01:26:53,340
now you think like an origin of
 

4191
01:26:53,340 --> 01:26:56,030
now you think like an origin of
Lifestyle but it's funny that that one

4192
01:26:56,030 --> 01:26:56,040
Lifestyle but it's funny that that one
 

4193
01:26:56,040 --> 01:26:58,729
Lifestyle but it's funny that that one
worked out let's see where else it goes

4194
01:26:58,729 --> 01:26:58,739
worked out let's see where else it goes
 

4195
01:26:58,739 --> 01:27:01,550
worked out let's see where else it goes
but having just emptiness and

4196
01:27:01,550 --> 01:27:01,560
but having just emptiness and
 

4197
01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:04,129
but having just emptiness and
unpredictability of

4198
01:27:04,129 --> 01:27:04,139
unpredictability of
 

4199
01:27:04,139 --> 01:27:06,470
unpredictability of
uncovering a novel solution can also

4200
01:27:06,470 --> 01:27:06,480
uncovering a novel solution can also
 

4201
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:09,110
uncovering a novel solution can also
have its own benefits and and we should

4202
01:27:09,110 --> 01:27:09,120
have its own benefits and and we should
 

4203
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:10,550
have its own benefits and and we should
uh

4204
01:27:10,550 --> 01:27:10,560
uh
 

4205
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:12,709
uh
be open to

4206
01:27:12,709 --> 01:27:12,719
be open to
 

4207
01:27:12,719 --> 01:27:14,450
be open to
what other Solutions might be out there

4208
01:27:14,450 --> 01:27:14,460
what other Solutions might be out there
 

4209
01:27:14,460 --> 01:27:16,370
what other Solutions might be out there
and exploring those Solutions okay

4210
01:27:16,370 --> 01:27:16,380
and exploring those Solutions okay
 

4211
01:27:16,380 --> 01:27:17,930
and exploring those Solutions okay
different chemistry problems so that's

4212
01:27:17,930 --> 01:27:17,940
different chemistry problems so that's
 

4213
01:27:17,940 --> 01:27:20,030
different chemistry problems so that's
where you see you see the other planets

4214
01:27:20,030 --> 01:27:20,040
where you see you see the other planets
 

4215
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:21,290
where you see you see the other planets
out there as different chemistry

4216
01:27:21,290 --> 01:27:21,300
out there as different chemistry
 

4217
01:27:21,300 --> 01:27:22,970
out there as different chemistry
problems to their own local environment

4218
01:27:22,970 --> 01:27:22,980
problems to their own local environment
 

4219
01:27:22,980 --> 01:27:26,930
problems to their own local environment
yes so how many chemistry problems

4220
01:27:26,930 --> 01:27:26,940
yes so how many chemistry problems
 

4221
01:27:26,940 --> 01:27:30,649
yes so how many chemistry problems
have solutions that are lifelike to you

4222
01:27:30,649 --> 01:27:30,659
have solutions that are lifelike to you
 

4223
01:27:30,659 --> 01:27:33,350
have solutions that are lifelike to you
out there in the universe

4224
01:27:33,350 --> 01:27:33,360
out there in the universe
 

4225
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:35,270
out there in the universe
wide open palette if you think about it

4226
01:27:35,270 --> 01:27:35,280
wide open palette if you think about it
 

4227
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:38,090
wide open palette if you think about it
I don't quite know it's the we know the

4228
01:27:38,090 --> 01:27:38,100
I don't quite know it's the we know the
 

4229
01:27:38,100 --> 01:27:40,070
I don't quite know it's the we know the
the chemistry is chemistry I don't think

4230
01:27:40,070 --> 01:27:40,080
the chemistry is chemistry I don't think
 

4231
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:40,910
the chemistry is chemistry I don't think
the chemistry will be different

4232
01:27:40,910 --> 01:27:40,920
the chemistry will be different
 

4233
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:43,310
the chemistry will be different
elsewhere but again what is selected by

4234
01:27:43,310 --> 01:27:43,320
elsewhere but again what is selected by
 

4235
01:27:43,320 --> 01:27:45,530
elsewhere but again what is selected by
chemistry will be determined by the

4236
01:27:45,530 --> 01:27:45,540
chemistry will be determined by the
 

4237
01:27:45,540 --> 01:27:47,510
chemistry will be determined by the
environment most likely see I think

4238
01:27:47,510 --> 01:27:47,520
environment most likely see I think
 

4239
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:50,030
environment most likely see I think
there is a life

4240
01:27:50,030 --> 01:27:50,040
there is a life
 

4241
01:27:50,040 --> 01:27:52,490
there is a life
everywhere out there

4242
01:27:52,490 --> 01:27:52,500
everywhere out there
 

4243
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:55,689
everywhere out there
so there's a guy named Nick Lane

4244
01:27:55,689 --> 01:27:55,699
so there's a guy named Nick Lane
 

4245
01:27:55,699 --> 01:27:59,870
so there's a guy named Nick Lane
whose gut and it's interesting to me I

4246
01:27:59,870 --> 01:27:59,880
whose gut and it's interesting to me I
 

4247
01:27:59,880 --> 01:28:01,910
whose gut and it's interesting to me I
wonder what you think about it his gut

4248
01:28:01,910 --> 01:28:01,920
wonder what you think about it his gut
 

4249
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:04,550
wonder what you think about it his gut
is there's life everywhere out there but

4250
01:28:04,550 --> 01:28:04,560
is there's life everywhere out there but
 

4251
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:07,189
is there's life everywhere out there but
it stops at like the bacteria stage so

4252
01:28:07,189 --> 01:28:07,199
it stops at like the bacteria stage so
 

4253
01:28:07,199 --> 01:28:09,950
it stops at like the bacteria stage so
he says that you you eukaryotes

4254
01:28:09,950 --> 01:28:09,960
he says that you you eukaryotes
 

4255
01:28:09,960 --> 01:28:12,709
he says that you you eukaryotes
is like the biggest invention and the

4256
01:28:12,709 --> 01:28:12,719
is like the biggest invention and the
 

4257
01:28:12,719 --> 01:28:14,810
is like the biggest invention and the
hardest one I wonder if he thinks that's

4258
01:28:14,810 --> 01:28:14,820
hardest one I wonder if he thinks that's
 

4259
01:28:14,820 --> 01:28:17,270
hardest one I wonder if he thinks that's
an accidental outcome if he thinks

4260
01:28:17,270 --> 01:28:17,280
an accidental outcome if he thinks
 

4261
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:18,830
an accidental outcome if he thinks
that's inevitable I wonder what that

4262
01:28:18,830 --> 01:28:18,840
that's inevitable I wonder what that
 

4263
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:21,530
that's inevitable I wonder what that
means but it's it's very it's a likely

4264
01:28:21,530 --> 01:28:21,540
means but it's it's very it's a likely
 

4265
01:28:21,540 --> 01:28:24,770
means but it's it's very it's a likely
possibility that the uh bacterial or

4266
01:28:24,770 --> 01:28:24,780
possibility that the uh bacterial or
 

4267
01:28:24,780 --> 01:28:26,629
possibility that the uh bacterial or
microbial life is definitely more

4268
01:28:26,629 --> 01:28:26,639
microbial life is definitely more
 

4269
01:28:26,639 --> 01:28:28,129
microbial life is definitely more
attainable

4270
01:28:28,129 --> 01:28:28,139
attainable
 

4271
01:28:28,139 --> 01:28:31,610
attainable
um so that that's a weird world where

4272
01:28:31,610 --> 01:28:31,620
um so that that's a weird world where
 

4273
01:28:31,620 --> 01:28:33,590
um so that that's a weird world where
our entire galaxy just says but our

4274
01:28:33,590 --> 01:28:33,600
our entire galaxy just says but our
 

4275
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:36,410
our entire galaxy just says but our
bacteria everywhere so you know if you

4276
01:28:36,410 --> 01:28:36,420
bacteria everywhere so you know if you
 

4277
01:28:36,420 --> 01:28:38,149
bacteria everywhere so you know if you
don't like microbes you aren't on the

4278
01:28:38,149 --> 01:28:38,159
don't like microbes you aren't on the
 

4279
01:28:38,159 --> 01:28:40,570
don't like microbes you aren't on the
wrong planet

4280
01:28:40,570 --> 01:28:40,580

 

4281
01:28:40,580 --> 01:28:43,310

and viruses I don't know which one is

4282
01:28:43,310 --> 01:28:43,320
and viruses I don't know which one is
 

4283
01:28:43,320 --> 01:28:46,010
and viruses I don't know which one is
more of but they're they're both and

4284
01:28:46,010 --> 01:28:46,020
more of but they're they're both and
 

4285
01:28:46,020 --> 01:28:48,350
more of but they're they're both and
most of them are like productive they're

4286
01:28:48,350 --> 01:28:48,360
most of them are like productive they're
 

4287
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:50,510
most of them are like productive they're
fascinating they do everything for us

4288
01:28:50,510 --> 01:28:50,520
fascinating they do everything for us
 

4289
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:53,330
fascinating they do everything for us
like bankruptcy on the wrong planet

4290
01:28:53,330 --> 01:28:53,340
like bankruptcy on the wrong planet
 

4291
01:28:53,340 --> 01:28:55,790
like bankruptcy on the wrong planet
uh you're full of good lines okay right

4292
01:28:55,790 --> 01:28:55,800
uh you're full of good lines okay right
 

4293
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:58,850
uh you're full of good lines okay right
right I just can't there's like an

4294
01:28:58,850 --> 01:28:58,860
right I just can't there's like an
 

4295
01:28:58,860 --> 01:29:01,729
right I just can't there's like an
imperative to the whole thing to me the

4296
01:29:01,729 --> 01:29:01,739
imperative to the whole thing to me the
 

4297
01:29:01,739 --> 01:29:04,550
imperative to the whole thing to me the
origin

4298
01:29:04,550 --> 01:29:04,560
origin
 

4299
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:07,189
origin
is the hard question but once it gets

4300
01:29:07,189 --> 01:29:07,199
is the hard question but once it gets
 

4301
01:29:07,199 --> 01:29:11,390
is the hard question but once it gets
going I just don't see them wait it

4302
01:29:11,390 --> 01:29:11,400
going I just don't see them wait it
 

4303
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:13,729
going I just don't see them wait it
seems like it's constantly creating more

4304
01:29:13,729 --> 01:29:13,739
seems like it's constantly creating more
 

4305
01:29:13,739 --> 01:29:16,010
seems like it's constantly creating more
intelligent things

4306
01:29:16,010 --> 01:29:16,020
intelligent things
 

4307
01:29:16,020 --> 01:29:17,709
intelligent things
more

4308
01:29:17,709 --> 01:29:17,719
more
 

4309
01:29:17,719 --> 01:29:19,970
more
fascinating complex things they're able

4310
01:29:19,970 --> 01:29:19,980
fascinating complex things they're able
 

4311
01:29:19,980 --> 01:29:21,770
fascinating complex things they're able
to solve that's a video that's a very

4312
01:29:21,770 --> 01:29:21,780
to solve that's a video that's a very
 

4313
01:29:21,780 --> 01:29:24,890
to solve that's a video that's a very
interesting like that's I I definitely

4314
01:29:24,890 --> 01:29:24,900
interesting like that's I I definitely
 

4315
01:29:24,900 --> 01:29:27,350
interesting like that's I I definitely
agree that the initial steps may be the

4316
01:29:27,350 --> 01:29:27,360
agree that the initial steps may be the
 

4317
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:29,390
agree that the initial steps may be the
ultimate determinants that once it's you

4318
01:29:29,390 --> 01:29:29,400
ultimate determinants that once it's you
 

4319
01:29:29,400 --> 01:29:31,729
ultimate determinants that once it's you
cannot stop it once it starts it's

4320
01:29:31,729 --> 01:29:31,739
cannot stop it once it starts it's
 

4321
01:29:31,739 --> 01:29:32,750
cannot stop it once it starts it's
possible

4322
01:29:32,750 --> 01:29:32,760
possible
 

4323
01:29:32,760 --> 01:29:35,590
possible
right and um I just have never on Earth

4324
01:29:35,590 --> 01:29:35,600
right and um I just have never on Earth
 

4325
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:38,450
right and um I just have never on Earth
maybe but maybe

4326
01:29:38,450 --> 01:29:38,460
maybe but maybe
 

4327
01:29:38,460 --> 01:29:42,169
maybe but maybe
I just whenever I see life it seems to

4328
01:29:42,169 --> 01:29:42,179
I just whenever I see life it seems to
 

4329
01:29:42,179 --> 01:29:44,050
I just whenever I see life it seems to
flourish

4330
01:29:44,050 --> 01:29:44,060
flourish
 

4331
01:29:44,060 --> 01:29:45,890
flourish
everywhere

4332
01:29:45,890 --> 01:29:45,900
everywhere
 

4333
01:29:45,900 --> 01:29:49,970
everywhere
it the thing is I don't the only thing I

4334
01:29:49,970 --> 01:29:49,980
it the thing is I don't the only thing I
 

4335
01:29:49,980 --> 01:29:52,490
it the thing is I don't the only thing I
haven't seen is the start of it

4336
01:29:52,490 --> 01:29:52,500
haven't seen is the start of it
 

4337
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:55,850
haven't seen is the start of it
exactly but that and how are we gonna

4338
01:29:55,850 --> 01:29:55,860
exactly but that and how are we gonna
 

4339
01:29:55,860 --> 01:29:57,410
exactly but that and how are we gonna
understand that if we don't the origin

4340
01:29:57,410 --> 01:29:57,420
understand that if we don't the origin
 

4341
01:29:57,420 --> 01:30:00,350
understand that if we don't the origin
of life science I mean that's the and

4342
01:30:00,350 --> 01:30:00,360
of life science I mean that's the and
 

4343
01:30:00,360 --> 01:30:03,410
of life science I mean that's the and
and the question here isn't exactly our

4344
01:30:03,410 --> 01:30:03,420
and the question here isn't exactly our
 

4345
01:30:03,420 --> 01:30:05,330
and the question here isn't exactly our
ability to recapitulate everything that

4346
01:30:05,330 --> 01:30:05,340
ability to recapitulate everything that
 

4347
01:30:05,340 --> 01:30:06,770
ability to recapitulate everything that
happened in the exact way that it

4348
01:30:06,770 --> 01:30:06,780
happened in the exact way that it
 

4349
01:30:06,780 --> 01:30:09,950
happened in the exact way that it
happened right this is about what can

4350
01:30:09,950 --> 01:30:09,960
happened right this is about what can
 

4351
01:30:09,960 --> 01:30:13,310
happened right this is about what can
happen rather than and or maybe how you

4352
01:30:13,310 --> 01:30:13,320
happen rather than and or maybe how you
 

4353
01:30:13,320 --> 01:30:16,189
happen rather than and or maybe how you
think it is possible to study the origin

4354
01:30:16,189 --> 01:30:16,199
think it is possible to study the origin
 

4355
01:30:16,199 --> 01:30:19,070
think it is possible to study the origin
of language using English

4356
01:30:19,070 --> 01:30:19,080
of language using English
 

4357
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:20,570
of language using English
so

4358
01:30:20,570 --> 01:30:20,580
so
 

4359
01:30:20,580 --> 01:30:22,610
so
like there's a very particular chemistry

4360
01:30:22,610 --> 01:30:22,620
like there's a very particular chemistry
 

4361
01:30:22,620 --> 01:30:24,709
like there's a very particular chemistry
here there's a particular set of

4362
01:30:24,709 --> 01:30:24,719
here there's a particular set of
 

4363
01:30:24,719 --> 01:30:26,450
here there's a particular set of
assumptions understanding about what

4364
01:30:26,450 --> 01:30:26,460
assumptions understanding about what
 

4365
01:30:26,460 --> 01:30:28,610
assumptions understanding about what
life is what everything is our

4366
01:30:28,610 --> 01:30:28,620
life is what everything is our
 

4367
01:30:28,620 --> 01:30:30,970
life is what everything is our
perception of reality is very

4368
01:30:30,970 --> 01:30:30,980
perception of reality is very
 

4369
01:30:30,980 --> 01:30:33,350
perception of reality is very
specifically constructed through the

4370
01:30:33,350 --> 01:30:33,360
specifically constructed through the
 

4371
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:35,390
specifically constructed through the
evolutionary process I wonder if it's

4372
01:30:35,390 --> 01:30:35,400
evolutionary process I wonder if it's
 

4373
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:38,629
evolutionary process I wonder if it's
possible to get to some first principles

4374
01:30:38,629 --> 01:30:38,639
possible to get to some first principles
 

4375
01:30:38,639 --> 01:30:40,669
possible to get to some first principles
deep understanding of

4376
01:30:40,669 --> 01:30:40,679
deep understanding of
 

4377
01:30:40,679 --> 01:30:43,070
deep understanding of
how life originates in such a way that

4378
01:30:43,070 --> 01:30:43,080
how life originates in such a way that
 

4379
01:30:43,080 --> 01:30:45,350
how life originates in such a way that
you can actually construct it on other

4380
01:30:45,350 --> 01:30:45,360
you can actually construct it on other
 

4381
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:48,830
you can actually construct it on other
planets I ultimately it feels like if

4382
01:30:48,830 --> 01:30:48,840
planets I ultimately it feels like if
 

4383
01:30:48,840 --> 01:30:50,290
planets I ultimately it feels like if
you're doing it in the lab on Earth

4384
01:30:50,290 --> 01:30:50,300
you're doing it in the lab on Earth
 

4385
01:30:50,300 --> 01:30:53,930
you're doing it in the lab on Earth
you're always going to be using some

4386
01:30:53,930 --> 01:30:53,940
you're always going to be using some
 

4387
01:30:53,940 --> 01:30:56,750
you're always going to be using some
aspect of the life that's already here

4388
01:30:56,750 --> 01:30:56,760
aspect of the life that's already here
 

4389
01:30:56,760 --> 01:30:58,330
aspect of the life that's already here
so

4390
01:30:58,330 --> 01:30:58,340
so
 

4391
01:30:58,340 --> 01:31:02,030
so
that's what I sort of talked about in my

4392
01:31:02,030 --> 01:31:02,040
that's what I sort of talked about in my
 

4393
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:03,229
that's what I sort of talked about in my
talk as well

4394
01:31:03,229 --> 01:31:03,239
talk as well
 

4395
01:31:03,239 --> 01:31:06,649
talk as well
and um everyone should go

4396
01:31:06,649 --> 01:31:06,659
and um everyone should go
 

4397
01:31:06,659 --> 01:31:09,050
and um everyone should go
watch the TED Talks very good the

4398
01:31:09,050 --> 01:31:09,060
watch the TED Talks very good the
 

4399
01:31:09,060 --> 01:31:11,209
watch the TED Talks very good the
annoying thing to me about TED Talks I

4400
01:31:11,209 --> 01:31:11,219
annoying thing to me about TED Talks I
 

4401
01:31:11,219 --> 01:31:12,649
annoying thing to me about TED Talks I
guess this by Design is they're too

4402
01:31:12,649 --> 01:31:12,659
guess this by Design is they're too
 

4403
01:31:12,659 --> 01:31:15,729
guess this by Design is they're too
short it's like come on

4404
01:31:15,729 --> 01:31:15,739
short it's like come on
 

4405
01:31:15,739 --> 01:31:17,870
short it's like come on
and did you know that there's no

4406
01:31:17,870 --> 01:31:17,880
and did you know that there's no
 

4407
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:19,550
and did you know that there's no
prompter involved

4408
01:31:19,550 --> 01:31:19,560
prompter involved
 

4409
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:22,129
prompter involved
there's no wait there is or there isn't

4410
01:31:22,129 --> 01:31:22,139
there's no wait there is or there isn't
 

4411
01:31:22,139 --> 01:31:24,830
there's no wait there is or there isn't
yeah you have to memorize stuff yeah

4412
01:31:24,830 --> 01:31:24,840
yeah you have to memorize stuff yeah
 

4413
01:31:24,840 --> 01:31:28,030
yeah you have to memorize stuff yeah
it's a

4414
01:31:28,030 --> 01:31:28,040

 

4415
01:31:28,040 --> 01:31:30,530

editor who probably is watching this too

4416
01:31:30,530 --> 01:31:30,540
editor who probably is watching this too
 

4417
01:31:30,540 --> 01:31:33,709
editor who probably is watching this too
David bielo it was very very helpful but

4418
01:31:33,709 --> 01:31:33,719
David bielo it was very very helpful but
 

4419
01:31:33,719 --> 01:31:37,070
David bielo it was very very helpful but
I would say I like this podcast it's a

4420
01:31:37,070 --> 01:31:37,080
I would say I like this podcast it's a
 

4421
01:31:37,080 --> 01:31:40,070
I would say I like this podcast it's a
very professional organization I respect

4422
01:31:40,070 --> 01:31:40,080
very professional organization I respect
 

4423
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:43,070
very professional organization I respect
that Medium uh yeah anyway the in the in

4424
01:31:43,070 --> 01:31:43,080
that Medium uh yeah anyway the in the in
 

4425
01:31:43,080 --> 01:31:45,350
that Medium uh yeah anyway the in the in
the talk about yeah life

4426
01:31:45,350 --> 01:31:45,360
the talk about yeah life
 

4427
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:48,229
the talk about yeah life
life creating life so it's a likely

4428
01:31:48,229 --> 01:31:48,239
life creating life so it's a likely
 

4429
01:31:48,239 --> 01:31:53,930
life creating life so it's a likely
scenario that once we understand how

4430
01:31:53,930 --> 01:31:53,940
scenario that once we understand how
 

4431
01:31:53,940 --> 01:31:55,310
scenario that once we understand how
life

4432
01:31:55,310 --> 01:31:55,320
life
 

4433
01:31:55,320 --> 01:31:59,629
life
is a chemical system is is capable of

4434
01:31:59,629 --> 01:31:59,639
is a chemical system is is capable of
 

4435
01:31:59,639 --> 01:32:02,990
is a chemical system is is capable of
formulating its own expression

4436
01:32:02,990 --> 01:32:03,000
formulating its own expression
 

4437
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:06,410
formulating its own expression
and generating a memory and manages its

4438
01:32:06,410 --> 01:32:06,420
and generating a memory and manages its
 

4439
01:32:06,420 --> 01:32:09,229
and generating a memory and manages its
existence on a planetary body for

4440
01:32:09,229 --> 01:32:09,239
existence on a planetary body for
 

4441
01:32:09,239 --> 01:32:10,850
existence on a planetary body for
billions of years

4442
01:32:10,850 --> 01:32:10,860
billions of years
 

4443
01:32:10,860 --> 01:32:12,430
billions of years
once we understand

4444
01:32:12,430 --> 01:32:12,440
once we understand
 

4445
01:32:12,440 --> 01:32:16,669
once we understand
what conditions gave rise to that

4446
01:32:16,669 --> 01:32:16,679
what conditions gave rise to that
 

4447
01:32:16,679 --> 01:32:23,149
what conditions gave rise to that
we may be very likely to understand

4448
01:32:23,149 --> 01:32:23,159

 

4449
01:32:23,159 --> 01:32:25,430

whether a different planet also be

4450
01:32:25,430 --> 01:32:25,440
whether a different planet also be
 

4451
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:28,729
whether a different planet also be
likely to instigate its own chemical

4452
01:32:28,729 --> 01:32:28,739
likely to instigate its own chemical
 

4453
01:32:28,739 --> 01:32:30,970
likely to instigate its own chemical
Revolution if it were

4454
01:32:30,970 --> 01:32:30,980
Revolution if it were
 

4455
01:32:30,980 --> 01:32:34,550
Revolution if it were
it was provided by through some missing

4456
01:32:34,550 --> 01:32:34,560
it was provided by through some missing
 

4457
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:36,649
it was provided by through some missing
ingredients so you can think of it as a

4458
01:32:36,649 --> 01:32:36,659
ingredients so you can think of it as a
 

4459
01:32:36,659 --> 01:32:37,970
ingredients so you can think of it as a
sanding fertilizer to a different

4460
01:32:37,970 --> 01:32:37,980
sanding fertilizer to a different
 

4461
01:32:37,980 --> 01:32:40,430
sanding fertilizer to a different
planets that is missing its own chemical

4462
01:32:40,430 --> 01:32:40,440
planets that is missing its own chemical
 

4463
01:32:40,440 --> 01:32:43,970
planets that is missing its own chemical
composition or lacking or that it needs

4464
01:32:43,970 --> 01:32:43,980
composition or lacking or that it needs
 

4465
01:32:43,980 --> 01:32:46,129
composition or lacking or that it needs
more of what it has

4466
01:32:46,129 --> 01:32:46,139
more of what it has
 

4467
01:32:46,139 --> 01:32:49,430
more of what it has
the difference between making that

4468
01:32:49,430 --> 01:32:49,440
the difference between making that
 

4469
01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:51,350
the difference between making that
planet Earth like which was this is this

4470
01:32:51,350 --> 01:32:51,360
planet Earth like which was this is this
 

4471
01:32:51,360 --> 01:32:52,490
planet Earth like which was this is this
is not what that's about we're not

4472
01:32:52,490 --> 01:32:52,500
is not what that's about we're not
 

4473
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:54,470
is not what that's about we're not
talking about terraforming or if you're

4474
01:32:54,470 --> 01:32:54,480
talking about terraforming or if you're
 

4475
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:55,970
talking about terraforming or if you're
not talking about turning that planet

4476
01:32:55,970 --> 01:32:55,980
not talking about turning that planet
 

4477
01:32:55,980 --> 01:32:59,030
not talking about turning that planet
into Earth-like system we are talking

4478
01:32:59,030 --> 01:32:59,040
into Earth-like system we are talking
 

4479
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:01,970
into Earth-like system we are talking
about first understanding that planet

4480
01:33:01,970 --> 01:33:01,980
about first understanding that planet
 

4481
01:33:01,980 --> 01:33:05,510
about first understanding that planet
studying its chemistry studying its its

4482
01:33:05,510 --> 01:33:05,520
studying its chemistry studying its its
 

4483
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:07,209
studying its chemistry studying its its
properties well enough to understand

4484
01:33:07,209 --> 01:33:07,219
properties well enough to understand
 

4485
01:33:07,219 --> 01:33:10,070
properties well enough to understand
whether it is close so it is on chemical

4486
01:33:10,070 --> 01:33:10,080
whether it is close so it is on chemical
 

4487
01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:12,950
whether it is close so it is on chemical
Revolution and maybe giving it that

4488
01:33:12,950 --> 01:33:12,960
Revolution and maybe giving it that
 

4489
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:14,209
Revolution and maybe giving it that
extra nudge

4490
01:33:14,209 --> 01:33:14,219
extra nudge
 

4491
01:33:14,219 --> 01:33:16,729
extra nudge
so this is obviously a pretty big

4492
01:33:16,729 --> 01:33:16,739
so this is obviously a pretty big
 

4493
01:33:16,739 --> 01:33:20,870
so this is obviously a pretty big
speculation and suggestion and it's a

4494
01:33:20,870 --> 01:33:20,880
speculation and suggestion and it's a
 

4495
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:22,430
speculation and suggestion and it's a
very interesting proposition because

4496
01:33:22,430 --> 01:33:22,440
very interesting proposition because
 

4497
01:33:22,440 --> 01:33:25,189
very interesting proposition because
this is a yes or no question right this

4498
01:33:25,189 --> 01:33:25,199
this is a yes or no question right this
 

4499
01:33:25,199 --> 01:33:27,410
this is a yes or no question right this
is this is the ultimate would you rather

4500
01:33:27,410 --> 01:33:27,420
is this is the ultimate would you rather
 

4501
01:33:27,420 --> 01:33:29,750
is this is the ultimate would you rather
it's it's the and I think it says a lot

4502
01:33:29,750 --> 01:33:29,760
it's it's the and I think it says a lot
 

4503
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:30,890
it's it's the and I think it says a lot
about

4504
01:33:30,890 --> 01:33:30,900
about
 

4505
01:33:30,900 --> 01:33:32,750
about
um the perception of the person who is

4506
01:33:32,750 --> 01:33:32,760
um the perception of the person who is
 

4507
01:33:32,760 --> 01:33:34,970
um the perception of the person who is
asking this question that if the answer

4508
01:33:34,970 --> 01:33:34,980
asking this question that if the answer
 

4509
01:33:34,980 --> 01:33:37,669
asking this question that if the answer
is no no no absolutely not that's not

4510
01:33:37,669 --> 01:33:37,679
is no no no absolutely not that's not
 

4511
01:33:37,679 --> 01:33:39,950
is no no no absolutely not that's not
something we want to do I wanna know why

4512
01:33:39,950 --> 01:33:39,960
something we want to do I wanna know why
 

4513
01:33:39,960 --> 01:33:41,810
something we want to do I wanna know why
that is the case so just to be clear

4514
01:33:41,810 --> 01:33:41,820
that is the case so just to be clear
 

4515
01:33:41,820 --> 01:33:43,370
that is the case so just to be clear
what we're talking about is looking at

4516
01:33:43,370 --> 01:33:43,380
what we're talking about is looking at
 

4517
01:33:43,380 --> 01:33:44,990
what we're talking about is looking at
the chemical cocktail of a particular

4518
01:33:44,990 --> 01:33:45,000
the chemical cocktail of a particular
 

4519
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:46,430
the chemical cocktail of a particular
planet

4520
01:33:46,430 --> 01:33:46,440
planet
 

4521
01:33:46,440 --> 01:33:50,330
planet
yeah and having like tasting it

4522
01:33:50,330 --> 01:33:50,340
yeah and having like tasting it
 

4523
01:33:50,340 --> 01:33:53,390
yeah and having like tasting it
and seeing uh seeing what's missing so

4524
01:33:53,390 --> 01:33:53,400
and seeing uh seeing what's missing so
 

4525
01:33:53,400 --> 01:33:55,250
and seeing uh seeing what's missing so
having a very systematic rigorous

4526
01:33:55,250 --> 01:33:55,260
having a very systematic rigorous
 

4527
01:33:55,260 --> 01:33:57,110
having a very systematic rigorous
scientific process of understanding what

4528
01:33:57,110 --> 01:33:57,120
scientific process of understanding what
 

4529
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:58,189
scientific process of understanding what
is missing

4530
01:33:58,189 --> 01:33:58,199
is missing
 

4531
01:33:58,199 --> 01:34:00,110
is missing
not what is missing in terms of to make

4532
01:34:00,110 --> 01:34:00,120
not what is missing in terms of to make
 

4533
01:34:00,120 --> 01:34:02,209
not what is missing in terms of to make
it Earth-like but what is missing in

4534
01:34:02,209 --> 01:34:02,219
it Earth-like but what is missing in
 

4535
01:34:02,219 --> 01:34:07,010
it Earth-like but what is missing in
order to be sufficiently uh have the

4536
01:34:07,010 --> 01:34:07,020
order to be sufficiently uh have the
 

4537
01:34:07,020 --> 01:34:09,350
order to be sufficiently uh have the
spark or the capacity of the spark to

4538
01:34:09,350 --> 01:34:09,360
spark or the capacity of the spark to
 

4539
01:34:09,360 --> 01:34:13,189
spark or the capacity of the spark to
launch the uh Evolution Revolution

4540
01:34:13,189 --> 01:34:13,199
launch the uh Evolution Revolution
 

4541
01:34:13,199 --> 01:34:16,250
launch the uh Evolution Revolution
The evolutionary process exactly so and

4542
01:34:16,250 --> 01:34:16,260
The evolutionary process exactly so and
 

4543
01:34:16,260 --> 01:34:19,930
The evolutionary process exactly so and
then the question is do we want to then

4544
01:34:19,930 --> 01:34:19,940
then the question is do we want to then
 

4545
01:34:19,940 --> 01:34:23,330
then the question is do we want to then
complete the cocktail the proposition is

4546
01:34:23,330 --> 01:34:23,340
complete the cocktail the proposition is
 

4547
01:34:23,340 --> 01:34:25,669
complete the cocktail the proposition is
to also make us think that we will

4548
01:34:25,669 --> 01:34:25,679
to also make us think that we will
 

4549
01:34:25,679 --> 01:34:27,830
to also make us think that we will
likely have this capacity at some point

4550
01:34:27,830 --> 01:34:27,840
likely have this capacity at some point
 

4551
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:30,830
likely have this capacity at some point
especially when we understand

4552
01:34:30,830 --> 01:34:30,840
especially when we understand
 

4553
01:34:30,840 --> 01:34:33,770
especially when we understand
origin of life better and better

4554
01:34:33,770 --> 01:34:33,780
origin of life better and better
 

4555
01:34:33,780 --> 01:34:36,169
origin of life better and better
right so we will be asking ourselves

4556
01:34:36,169 --> 01:34:36,179
right so we will be asking ourselves
 

4557
01:34:36,179 --> 01:34:38,990
right so we will be asking ourselves
this question I guess I wanted to bring

4558
01:34:38,990 --> 01:34:39,000
this question I guess I wanted to bring
 

4559
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,810
this question I guess I wanted to bring
this to Daylight a little bit because uh

4560
01:34:41,810 --> 01:34:41,820
this to Daylight a little bit because uh
 

4561
01:34:41,820 --> 01:34:45,350
this to Daylight a little bit because uh
maybe in 10 20 years maybe more so you

4562
01:34:45,350 --> 01:34:45,360
maybe in 10 20 years maybe more so you
 

4563
01:34:45,360 --> 01:34:46,729
maybe in 10 20 years maybe more so you
wanted to ask the ethical question

4564
01:34:46,729 --> 01:34:46,739
wanted to ask the ethical question
 

4565
01:34:46,739 --> 01:34:48,709
wanted to ask the ethical question
should we

4566
01:34:48,709 --> 01:34:48,719
should we
 

4567
01:34:48,719 --> 01:34:52,790
should we
of basically start life

4568
01:34:52,790 --> 01:34:52,800
of basically start life
 

4569
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:55,970
of basically start life
Elsewhere on another planet or enable

4570
01:34:55,970 --> 01:34:55,980
Elsewhere on another planet or enable
 

4571
01:34:55,980 --> 01:34:59,390
Elsewhere on another planet or enable
the the chemicals uh the chemical

4572
01:34:59,390 --> 01:34:59,400
the the chemicals uh the chemical
 

4573
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:01,790
the the chemicals uh the chemical
capacity of that planet that it may one

4574
01:35:01,790 --> 01:35:01,800
capacity of that planet that it may one
 

4575
01:35:01,800 --> 01:35:05,510
capacity of that planet that it may one
day itself get there okay so for me the

4576
01:35:05,510 --> 01:35:05,520
day itself get there okay so for me the
 

4577
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:07,010
day itself get there okay so for me the
answer is yes

4578
01:35:07,010 --> 01:35:07,020
answer is yes
 

4579
01:35:07,020 --> 01:35:09,950
answer is yes
so if you were to try to argue against

4580
01:35:09,950 --> 01:35:09,960
so if you were to try to argue against
 

4581
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:13,070
so if you were to try to argue against
my yes what would you say why not what's

4582
01:35:13,070 --> 01:35:13,080
my yes what would you say why not what's
 

4583
01:35:13,080 --> 01:35:14,750
my yes what would you say why not what's
the worst that could happen

4584
01:35:14,750 --> 01:35:14,760
the worst that could happen
 

4585
01:35:14,760 --> 01:35:18,169
the worst that could happen
if we seed another planet with life what

4586
01:35:18,169 --> 01:35:18,179
if we seed another planet with life what
 

4587
01:35:18,179 --> 01:35:19,970
if we seed another planet with life what
are the things we should think about is

4588
01:35:19,970 --> 01:35:19,980
are the things we should think about is
 

4589
01:35:19,980 --> 01:35:22,970
are the things we should think about is
your main concern a chemical biological

4590
01:35:22,970 --> 01:35:22,980
your main concern a chemical biological
 

4591
01:35:22,980 --> 01:35:25,850
your main concern a chemical biological
one or is it an ethical one what do you

4592
01:35:25,850 --> 01:35:25,860
one or is it an ethical one what do you
 

4593
01:35:25,860 --> 01:35:27,110
one or is it an ethical one what do you
think about well the worst thing that

4594
01:35:27,110 --> 01:35:27,120
think about well the worst thing that
 

4595
01:35:27,120 --> 01:35:28,610
think about well the worst thing that
can happen is that it wouldn't work

4596
01:35:28,610 --> 01:35:28,620
can happen is that it wouldn't work
 

4597
01:35:28,620 --> 01:35:31,370
can happen is that it wouldn't work
right so that it's not a

4598
01:35:31,370 --> 01:35:31,380
right so that it's not a
 

4599
01:35:31,380 --> 01:35:35,689
right so that it's not a
the likely it's not likely that any

4600
01:35:35,689 --> 01:35:35,699
the likely it's not likely that any
 

4601
01:35:35,699 --> 01:35:37,610
the likely it's not likely that any
attempt like this would work that's

4602
01:35:37,610 --> 01:35:37,620
attempt like this would work that's
 

4603
01:35:37,620 --> 01:35:40,430
attempt like this would work that's
probably because how do you so you gotta

4604
01:35:40,430 --> 01:35:40,440
probably because how do you so you gotta
 

4605
01:35:40,440 --> 01:35:43,189
probably because how do you so you gotta
be very you know you have to have an

4606
01:35:43,189 --> 01:35:43,199
be very you know you have to have an
 

4607
01:35:43,199 --> 01:35:44,870
be very you know you have to have an
understanding that I don't think we have

4608
01:35:44,870 --> 01:35:44,880
understanding that I don't think we have
 

4609
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:47,390
understanding that I don't think we have
just yet I see because if it doesn't

4610
01:35:47,390 --> 01:35:47,400
just yet I see because if it doesn't
 

4611
01:35:47,400 --> 01:35:51,010
just yet I see because if it doesn't
work then we could try again right

4612
01:35:51,010 --> 01:35:51,020
work then we could try again right
 

4613
01:35:51,020 --> 01:35:52,790
work then we could try again right
to me

4614
01:35:52,790 --> 01:35:52,800
to me
 

4615
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:55,010
to me
the worst case the thing I would be

4616
01:35:55,010 --> 01:35:55,020
the worst case the thing I would be
 

4617
01:35:55,020 --> 01:35:59,090
the worst case the thing I would be
worried about is we create life I mean

4618
01:35:59,090 --> 01:35:59,100
worried about is we create life I mean
 

4619
01:35:59,100 --> 01:36:01,189
worried about is we create life I mean
the same stuff I worry about like with

4620
01:36:01,189 --> 01:36:01,199
the same stuff I worry about like with
 

4621
01:36:01,199 --> 01:36:03,350
the same stuff I worry about like with
plants are

4622
01:36:03,350 --> 01:36:03,360
plants are
 

4623
01:36:03,360 --> 01:36:05,450
plants are
is things that might have a conscious

4624
01:36:05,450 --> 01:36:05,460
is things that might have a conscious
 

4625
01:36:05,460 --> 01:36:08,450
is things that might have a conscious
experience and then

4626
01:36:08,450 --> 01:36:08,460
experience and then
 

4627
01:36:08,460 --> 01:36:13,189
experience and then
the the dark aspect of life is life is

4628
01:36:13,189 --> 01:36:13,199
the the dark aspect of life is life is
 

4629
01:36:13,199 --> 01:36:15,410
the the dark aspect of life is life is
increasingly complex life

4630
01:36:15,410 --> 01:36:15,420
increasingly complex life
 

4631
01:36:15,420 --> 01:36:17,990
increasingly complex life
maybe I'm anthropomorphizing but it

4632
01:36:17,990 --> 01:36:18,000
maybe I'm anthropomorphizing but it
 

4633
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,990
maybe I'm anthropomorphizing but it
seems to have the capacity to suffer huh

4634
01:36:20,990 --> 01:36:21,000
seems to have the capacity to suffer huh
 

4635
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:24,649
seems to have the capacity to suffer huh
and so we're creating something

4636
01:36:24,649 --> 01:36:24,659
and so we're creating something
 

4637
01:36:24,659 --> 01:36:27,550
and so we're creating something
it's like when you have children you put

4638
01:36:27,550 --> 01:36:27,560
it's like when you have children you put
 

4639
01:36:27,560 --> 01:36:31,030
it's like when you have children you put
creatures into this world

4640
01:36:31,030 --> 01:36:31,040
creatures into this world
 

4641
01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:35,870
creatures into this world
that will suffer can suffer and may

4642
01:36:35,870 --> 01:36:35,880
that will suffer can suffer and may
 

4643
01:36:35,880 --> 01:36:38,090
that will suffer can suffer and may
suffer depending on how you view life

4644
01:36:38,090 --> 01:36:38,100
suffer depending on how you view life
 

4645
01:36:38,100 --> 01:36:41,450
suffer depending on how you view life
may likely suffer and so now you carry

4646
01:36:41,450 --> 01:36:41,460
may likely suffer and so now you carry
 

4647
01:36:41,460 --> 01:36:43,910
may likely suffer and so now you carry
this responsibility for doing your best

4648
01:36:43,910 --> 01:36:43,920
this responsibility for doing your best
 

4649
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:46,129
this responsibility for doing your best
to alleviate any suffering they might go

4650
01:36:46,129 --> 01:36:46,139
to alleviate any suffering they might go
 

4651
01:36:46,139 --> 01:36:49,550
to alleviate any suffering they might go
through and that that perhaps that's uh

4652
01:36:49,550 --> 01:36:49,560
through and that that perhaps that's uh
 

4653
01:36:49,560 --> 01:36:52,250
through and that that perhaps that's uh
romanticizing this notion of life

4654
01:36:52,250 --> 01:36:52,260
romanticizing this notion of life
 

4655
01:36:52,260 --> 01:36:54,470
romanticizing this notion of life
perhaps bacteria are not capable of

4656
01:36:54,470 --> 01:36:54,480
perhaps bacteria are not capable of
 

4657
01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:57,110
perhaps bacteria are not capable of
suffering but perhaps it'll create more

4658
01:36:57,110 --> 01:36:57,120
suffering but perhaps it'll create more
 

4659
01:36:57,120 --> 01:36:59,030
suffering but perhaps it'll create more
complex life forms that

4660
01:36:59,030 --> 01:36:59,040
complex life forms that
 

4661
01:36:59,040 --> 01:37:01,390
complex life forms that
would be able to suffer

4662
01:37:01,390 --> 01:37:01,400
would be able to suffer
 

4663
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:04,610
would be able to suffer
and that feels like a responsibility as

4664
01:37:04,610 --> 01:37:04,620
and that feels like a responsibility as
 

4665
01:37:04,620 --> 01:37:06,709
and that feels like a responsibility as
well of course other people would be

4666
01:37:06,709 --> 01:37:06,719
well of course other people would be
 

4667
01:37:06,719 --> 01:37:09,590
well of course other people would be
concerned the more obvious concern is

4668
01:37:09,590 --> 01:37:09,600
concerned the more obvious concern is
 

4669
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:11,870
concerned the more obvious concern is
like well you just created a life form

4670
01:37:11,870 --> 01:37:11,880
like well you just created a life form
 

4671
01:37:11,880 --> 01:37:13,250
like well you just created a life form
how do you know it's not going to be a

4672
01:37:13,250 --> 01:37:13,260
how do you know it's not going to be a
 

4673
01:37:13,260 --> 01:37:16,610
how do you know it's not going to be a
super deadly virus that somehow is able

4674
01:37:16,610 --> 01:37:16,620
super deadly virus that somehow is able
 

4675
01:37:16,620 --> 01:37:18,950
super deadly virus that somehow is able
to hurt humans yeah my my concern is

4676
01:37:18,950 --> 01:37:18,960
to hurt humans yeah my my concern is
 

4677
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:20,510
to hurt humans yeah my my concern is
more I feel like that's a solvable

4678
01:37:20,510 --> 01:37:20,520
more I feel like that's a solvable
 

4679
01:37:20,520 --> 01:37:22,790
more I feel like that's a solvable
problem the problem of

4680
01:37:22,790 --> 01:37:22,800
problem the problem of
 

4681
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:25,490
problem the problem of
creating conscious beings that are able

4682
01:37:25,490 --> 01:37:25,500
creating conscious beings that are able
 

4683
01:37:25,500 --> 01:37:28,189
creating conscious beings that are able
to suffer that's a tricky one yeah I can

4684
01:37:28,189 --> 01:37:28,199
to suffer that's a tricky one yeah I can
 

4685
01:37:28,199 --> 01:37:30,110
to suffer that's a tricky one yeah I can
see why because

4686
01:37:30,110 --> 01:37:30,120
see why because
 

4687
01:37:30,120 --> 01:37:32,510
see why because
because it goes back to again with

4688
01:37:32,510 --> 01:37:32,520
because it goes back to again with
 

4689
01:37:32,520 --> 01:37:34,129
because it goes back to again with
first of all

4690
01:37:34,129 --> 01:37:34,139
first of all
 

4691
01:37:34,139 --> 01:37:34,790
first of all
um

4692
01:37:34,790 --> 01:37:34,800
um
 

4693
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:38,510
um
do we have a responsibility to

4694
01:37:38,510 --> 01:37:38,520
do we have a responsibility to
 

4695
01:37:38,520 --> 01:37:42,410
do we have a responsibility to
propagate more of this chemistry that we

4696
01:37:42,410 --> 01:37:42,420
propagate more of this chemistry that we
 

4697
01:37:42,420 --> 01:37:44,810
propagate more of this chemistry that we
have on this planet elsewhere

4698
01:37:44,810 --> 01:37:44,820
have on this planet elsewhere
 

4699
01:37:44,820 --> 01:37:48,350
have on this planet elsewhere
given that we know ultimately we will be

4700
01:37:48,350 --> 01:37:48,360
given that we know ultimately we will be
 

4701
01:37:48,360 --> 01:37:49,790
given that we know ultimately we will be
vanished

4702
01:37:49,790 --> 01:37:49,800
vanished
 

4703
01:37:49,800 --> 01:37:52,689
vanished
by the I mean entire planet

4704
01:37:52,689 --> 01:37:52,699
by the I mean entire planet
 

4705
01:37:52,699 --> 01:37:56,530
by the I mean entire planet
and if this is in fact a very rare

4706
01:37:56,530 --> 01:37:56,540
and if this is in fact a very rare
 

4707
01:37:56,540 --> 01:37:59,810
and if this is in fact a very rare
chemical events that happens because all

4708
01:37:59,810 --> 01:37:59,820
chemical events that happens because all
 

4709
01:37:59,820 --> 01:38:00,649
chemical events that happens because all
the

4710
01:38:00,649 --> 01:38:00,659
the
 

4711
01:38:00,659 --> 01:38:03,350
the
right circumstances came together and we

4712
01:38:03,350 --> 01:38:03,360
right circumstances came together and we
 

4713
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:05,330
right circumstances came together and we
were the lucky one

4714
01:38:05,330 --> 01:38:05,340
were the lucky one
 

4715
01:38:05,340 --> 01:38:07,729
were the lucky one
do we have

4716
01:38:07,729 --> 01:38:07,739
do we have
 

4717
01:38:07,739 --> 01:38:10,790
do we have
a responsibility to sponsor it this is a

4718
01:38:10,790 --> 01:38:10,800
a responsibility to sponsor it this is a
 

4719
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:13,850
a responsibility to sponsor it this is a
if if we were to back up sponsor I like

4720
01:38:13,850 --> 01:38:13,860
if if we were to back up sponsor I like
 

4721
01:38:13,860 --> 01:38:16,790
if if we were to back up sponsor I like
it let's go where to put it yeah if you

4722
01:38:16,790 --> 01:38:16,800
it let's go where to put it yeah if you
 

4723
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:20,090
it let's go where to put it yeah if you
try to back up remnants of our

4724
01:38:20,090 --> 01:38:20,100
try to back up remnants of our
 

4725
01:38:20,100 --> 01:38:22,669
try to back up remnants of our
civilization right so we've got a

4726
01:38:22,669 --> 01:38:22,679
civilization right so we've got a
 

4727
01:38:22,679 --> 01:38:24,350
civilization right so we've got a
potentially

4728
01:38:24,350 --> 01:38:24,360
potentially
 

4729
01:38:24,360 --> 01:38:27,590
potentially
creates conditions on different planets

4730
01:38:27,590 --> 01:38:27,600
creates conditions on different planets
 

4731
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:30,290
creates conditions on different planets
so that humans can survive given that we

4732
01:38:30,290 --> 01:38:30,300
so that humans can survive given that we
 

4733
01:38:30,300 --> 01:38:32,810
so that humans can survive given that we
know or we want to just just for the

4734
01:38:32,810 --> 01:38:32,820
know or we want to just just for the
 

4735
01:38:32,820 --> 01:38:34,430
know or we want to just just for the
sake of

4736
01:38:34,430 --> 01:38:34,440
sake of
 

4737
01:38:34,440 --> 01:38:37,970
sake of
growing yeah propagating uh becoming

4738
01:38:37,970 --> 01:38:37,980
growing yeah propagating uh becoming
 

4739
01:38:37,980 --> 01:38:40,189
growing yeah propagating uh becoming
multiple terrorist species exactly but

4740
01:38:40,189 --> 01:38:40,199
multiple terrorist species exactly but
 

4741
01:38:40,199 --> 01:38:42,709
multiple terrorist species exactly but
what really is at stake here I think

4742
01:38:42,709 --> 01:38:42,719
what really is at stake here I think
 

4743
01:38:42,719 --> 01:38:44,510
what really is at stake here I think
it's actually or what is really more

4744
01:38:44,510 --> 01:38:44,520
it's actually or what is really more
 

4745
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:47,570
it's actually or what is really more
interesting is what we don't see which

4746
01:38:47,570 --> 01:38:47,580
interesting is what we don't see which
 

4747
01:38:47,580 --> 01:38:50,090
interesting is what we don't see which
is the again that the chemical behavior

4748
01:38:50,090 --> 01:38:50,100
is the again that the chemical behavior
 

4749
01:38:50,100 --> 01:38:52,070
is the again that the chemical behavior
that enabled everything at first place

4750
01:38:52,070 --> 01:38:52,080
that enabled everything at first place
 

4751
01:38:52,080 --> 01:38:54,649
that enabled everything at first place
that's different than

4752
01:38:54,649 --> 01:38:54,659
that's different than
 

4753
01:38:54,659 --> 01:38:57,110
that's different than
sending potato crops or engineering

4754
01:38:57,110 --> 01:38:57,120
sending potato crops or engineering
 

4755
01:38:57,120 --> 01:38:58,970
sending potato crops or engineering
bacteria to live on a different planet

4756
01:38:58,970 --> 01:38:58,980
bacteria to live on a different planet
 

4757
01:38:58,980 --> 01:39:00,350
bacteria to live on a different planet
that's very different

4758
01:39:00,350 --> 01:39:00,360
that's very different
 

4759
01:39:00,360 --> 01:39:03,490
that's very different
you're really good stripping it down to

4760
01:39:03,490 --> 01:39:03,500
you're really good stripping it down to
 

4761
01:39:03,500 --> 01:39:07,070
you're really good stripping it down to
what is what it what is possible at the

4762
01:39:07,070 --> 01:39:07,080
what is what it what is possible at the
 

4763
01:39:07,080 --> 01:39:09,590
what is what it what is possible at the
chemical level so even if you are

01:39:09,590 --> 01:39:09,600
chemical level so even if you are
 

4765
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:12,169
chemical level so even if you are
instigating the con chemistry on

4766
01:39:12,169 --> 01:39:12,179
instigating the con chemistry on
 

4767
01:39:12,179 --> 01:39:14,330
instigating the con chemistry on
different planets you are letting that

4768
01:39:14,330 --> 01:39:14,340
different planets you are letting that
 

4769
01:39:14,340 --> 01:39:17,209
different planets you are letting that
very planet to do its thing you're not

4770
01:39:17,209 --> 01:39:17,219
very planet to do its thing you're not
 

4771
01:39:17,219 --> 01:39:19,189
very planet to do its thing you're not
necessarily contaminating this planet

4772
01:39:19,189 --> 01:39:19,199
necessarily contaminating this planet
 

4773
01:39:19,199 --> 01:39:21,350
necessarily contaminating this planet
with different chemistry because the

4774
01:39:21,350 --> 01:39:21,360
with different chemistry because the
 

4775
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:24,770
with different chemistry because the
idea behind us at this the way I would I

4776
01:39:24,770 --> 01:39:24,780
idea behind us at this the way I would I
 

4777
01:39:24,780 --> 01:39:27,530
idea behind us at this the way I would I
thought about is that you understand

4778
01:39:27,530 --> 01:39:27,540
thought about is that you understand
 

4779
01:39:27,540 --> 01:39:29,149
thought about is that you understand
that planet you understand the

4780
01:39:29,149 --> 01:39:29,159
that planet you understand the
 

4781
01:39:29,159 --> 01:39:30,830
that planet you understand the
conditions you understand the chemistry

4782
01:39:30,830 --> 01:39:30,840
conditions you understand the chemistry
 

4783
01:39:30,840 --> 01:39:34,330
conditions you understand the chemistry
of the planet really well before

4784
01:39:34,330 --> 01:39:34,340
of the planet really well before
 

4785
01:39:34,340 --> 01:39:37,189
of the planet really well before
choosing the planet as a candidate at

4786
01:39:37,189 --> 01:39:37,199
choosing the planet as a candidate at
 

4787
01:39:37,199 --> 01:39:38,149
choosing the planet as a candidate at
first place

4788
01:39:38,149 --> 01:39:38,159
first place
 

4789
01:39:38,159 --> 01:39:41,270
first place
and then it's not about sending a

4790
01:39:41,270 --> 01:39:41,280
and then it's not about sending a
 

4791
01:39:41,280 --> 01:39:43,550
and then it's not about sending a
missing ingredient per se but again just

4792
01:39:43,550 --> 01:39:43,560
missing ingredient per se but again just
 

4793
01:39:43,560 --> 01:39:46,970
missing ingredient per se but again just
sending more of what it already has

4794
01:39:46,970 --> 01:39:46,980
sending more of what it already has
 

4795
01:39:46,980 --> 01:39:49,250
sending more of what it already has
this that would be respecting that

4796
01:39:49,250 --> 01:39:49,260
this that would be respecting that
 

4797
01:39:49,260 --> 01:39:50,810
this that would be respecting that
planet's condition to so I'm not

4798
01:39:50,810 --> 01:39:50,820
planet's condition to so I'm not
 

4799
01:39:50,820 --> 01:39:52,970
planet's condition to so I'm not
suggesting any occupation I'm not

4800
01:39:52,970 --> 01:39:52,980
suggesting any occupation I'm not
 

4801
01:39:52,980 --> 01:39:55,070
suggesting any occupation I'm not
suggesting any colonization I'm not

4802
01:39:55,070 --> 01:39:55,080
suggesting any colonization I'm not
 

4803
01:39:55,080 --> 01:39:57,050
suggesting any colonization I'm not
suggesting any like let's just strip

4804
01:39:57,050 --> 01:39:57,060
suggesting any like let's just strip
 

4805
01:39:57,060 --> 01:39:57,950
suggesting any like let's just strip
everything and make everything

4806
01:39:57,950 --> 01:39:57,960
everything and make everything
 

4807
01:39:57,960 --> 01:39:59,330
everything and make everything
Earth-like

4808
01:39:59,330 --> 01:39:59,340
Earth-like
 

4809
01:39:59,340 --> 01:40:01,370
Earth-like
that's not what I'm saying it's more

4810
01:40:01,370 --> 01:40:01,380
that's not what I'm saying it's more
 

4811
01:40:01,380 --> 01:40:03,290
that's not what I'm saying it's more
about empowering that place

4812
01:40:03,290 --> 01:40:03,300
about empowering that place
 

4813
01:40:03,300 --> 01:40:07,390
about empowering that place
what you are saying is is likely to be

4814
01:40:07,390 --> 01:40:07,400
what you are saying is is likely to be
 

4815
01:40:07,400 --> 01:40:10,610
what you are saying is is likely to be
the motivator behind all this that's not

4816
01:40:10,610 --> 01:40:10,620
the motivator behind all this that's not
 

4817
01:40:10,620 --> 01:40:13,550
the motivator behind all this that's not
because I see suffering I see pain it's

4818
01:40:13,550 --> 01:40:13,560
because I see suffering I see pain it's
 

4819
01:40:13,560 --> 01:40:15,649
because I see suffering I see pain it's
it's very interesting I think this is a

4820
01:40:15,649 --> 01:40:15,659
it's very interesting I think this is a
 

4821
01:40:15,659 --> 01:40:18,110
it's very interesting I think this is a
question that really reveals about a lot

4822
01:40:18,110 --> 01:40:18,120
question that really reveals about a lot
 

4823
01:40:18,120 --> 01:40:20,390
question that really reveals about a lot
about the person who's answering it well

4824
01:40:20,390 --> 01:40:20,400
about the person who's answering it well
 

4825
01:40:20,400 --> 01:40:22,970
about the person who's answering it well
okay so the pushback on my

4826
01:40:22,970 --> 01:40:22,980
okay so the pushback on my
 

4827
01:40:22,980 --> 01:40:24,890
okay so the pushback on my
pushback

4828
01:40:24,890 --> 01:40:24,900
pushback
 

4829
01:40:24,900 --> 01:40:28,370
pushback
if I so I'm deeply troubled by suffering

4830
01:40:28,370 --> 01:40:28,380
if I so I'm deeply troubled by suffering
 

4831
01:40:28,380 --> 01:40:30,830
if I so I'm deeply troubled by suffering
then I should be probably paralyzed

4832
01:40:30,830 --> 01:40:30,840
then I should be probably paralyzed
 

4833
01:40:30,840 --> 01:40:33,470
then I should be probably paralyzed
about the history of life on Earth

4834
01:40:33,470 --> 01:40:33,480
about the history of life on Earth
 

4835
01:40:33,480 --> 01:40:34,970
about the history of life on Earth
and

4836
01:40:34,970 --> 01:40:34,980
and
 

4837
01:40:34,980 --> 01:40:37,550
and
um you know there's can you elaborate

4838
01:40:37,550 --> 01:40:37,560
um you know there's can you elaborate
 

4839
01:40:37,560 --> 01:40:40,430
um you know there's can you elaborate
what do you mean most of Life who's ever

4840
01:40:40,430 --> 01:40:40,440
what do you mean most of Life who's ever
 

4841
01:40:40,440 --> 01:40:41,450
what do you mean most of Life who's ever
lived

4842
01:40:41,450 --> 01:40:41,460
lived
 

4843
01:40:41,460 --> 01:40:43,669
lived
suffered in ways that are almost

4844
01:40:43,669 --> 01:40:43,679
suffered in ways that are almost
 

4845
01:40:43,679 --> 01:40:46,970
suffered in ways that are almost
unimaginable to me you mean um like

4846
01:40:46,970 --> 01:40:46,980
unimaginable to me you mean um like
 

4847
01:40:46,980 --> 01:40:49,310
unimaginable to me you mean um like
you're our own species our own species

you're our own species our own species
 

4849
01:40:49,320 --> 01:40:52,129
you're our own species our own species
and before and animals living today and

4850
01:40:52,129 --> 01:40:52,139
and before and animals living today and
 

4851
01:40:52,139 --> 01:40:53,450

we're not even talking about factory

4852
01:40:53,450 --> 01:40:53,460
we're not even talking about factory
 

4853
01:40:53,460 --> 01:40:55,189
we're not even talking about factory
farms

4854
01:40:55,189 --> 01:40:55,199
farms
 

4855
01:40:55,199 --> 01:40:59,149
farms
uh were just uh animals living in

4856
01:40:59,149 --> 01:40:59,159
uh were just uh animals living in
 

4857
01:40:59,159 --> 01:41:01,189
uh were just uh animals living in
extreme poverty in the jungle

4858
01:41:01,189 --> 01:41:01,199
extreme poverty in the jungle
 

4859
01:41:01,199 --> 01:41:03,649
extreme poverty in the jungle
you don't people think like in a natural

4860
01:41:03,649 --> 01:41:03,659
you don't people think like in a natural
 

4861
01:41:03,659 --> 01:41:05,330
you don't people think like in a natural
environment animals live in a happy

4862
01:41:05,330 --> 01:41:05,340
environment animals live in a happy
 

4863
01:41:05,340 --> 01:41:08,750
environment animals live in a happy
place no it's a brutal place of

4864
01:41:08,750 --> 01:41:08,760
place no it's a brutal place of
 

4865
01:41:08,760 --> 01:41:10,550
place no it's a brutal place of
desperately trying to survive of

4866
01:41:10,550 --> 01:41:10,560
desperately trying to survive of
 

4867
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:12,770
desperately trying to survive of
desperately trying to look for food and

4868
01:41:12,770 --> 01:41:12,780
desperately trying to look for food and
 

4869
01:41:12,780 --> 01:41:14,870
desperately trying to look for food and
it's just like all of that life that's

4870
01:41:14,870 --> 01:41:14,880
it's just like all of that life that's
 

4871
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:16,790
it's just like all of that life that's
just mammals and we understand mammals

4872
01:41:16,790 --> 01:41:16,800
just mammals and we understand mammals
 

4873
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:19,790
just mammals and we understand mammals
but like throughout like trillions of

4874
01:41:19,790 --> 01:41:19,800
but like throughout like trillions of
 

4875
01:41:19,800 --> 01:41:22,430
but like throughout like trillions of
organisms that led up to those mammals

4876
01:41:22,430 --> 01:41:22,440
organisms that led up to those mammals
 

4877
01:41:22,440 --> 01:41:24,590
organisms that led up to those mammals
and the organisms living everywhere like

4878
01:41:24,590 --> 01:41:24,600
and the organisms living everywhere like
 

4879
01:41:24,600 --> 01:41:26,810
and the organisms living everywhere like
even bacteria there's death everywhere

4880
01:41:26,810 --> 01:41:26,820
even bacteria there's death everywhere
 

4881
01:41:26,820 --> 01:41:30,350
even bacteria there's death everywhere
so maybe this idea of death this idea of

4882
01:41:30,350 --> 01:41:30,360
so maybe this idea of death this idea of
 

4883
01:41:30,360 --> 01:41:31,370
so maybe this idea of death this idea of
suffering

4884
01:41:31,370 --> 01:41:31,380
suffering
 

4885
01:41:31,380 --> 01:41:34,010
suffering
is actually this thing that we see as a

4886
01:41:34,010 --> 01:41:34,020
is actually this thing that we see as a
 

4887
01:41:34,020 --> 01:41:35,030
is actually this thing that we see as a
bug

4888
01:41:35,030 --> 01:41:35,040
bug
 

4889
01:41:35,040 --> 01:41:37,129
bug
is actually a feature

4890
01:41:37,129 --> 01:41:37,139
is actually a feature
 

4891
01:41:37,139 --> 01:41:39,530
is actually a feature
I don't think suffering is a linear

4892
01:41:39,530 --> 01:41:39,540
I don't think suffering is a linear
 

4893
01:41:39,540 --> 01:41:41,930
I don't think suffering is a linear
property like that with life

4894
01:41:41,930 --> 01:41:41,940
property like that with life
 

4895
01:41:41,940 --> 01:41:44,149
property like that with life
and I may be with Nick Lane on this one

4896
01:41:44,149 --> 01:41:44,159
and I may be with Nick Lane on this one
 

4897
01:41:44,159 --> 01:41:46,609
and I may be with Nick Lane on this one
that the likeliness of anything similar

4898
01:41:46,609 --> 01:41:46,619
that the likeliness of anything similar
 

4899
01:41:46,619 --> 01:41:49,070
that the likeliness of anything similar
to what we got here evolving in another

4900
01:41:49,070 --> 01:41:49,080
to what we got here evolving in another
 

4901
01:41:49,080 --> 01:41:51,649
to what we got here evolving in another
planetary body I think is quite low

4902
01:41:51,649 --> 01:41:51,659
planetary body I think is quite low
 

4903
01:41:51,659 --> 01:41:54,649
planetary body I think is quite low
where would you say is the the biggest

4904
01:41:54,649 --> 01:41:54,659
where would you say is the the biggest
 

4905
01:41:54,659 --> 01:41:57,350
where would you say is the the biggest
unlikely thing do you mean humans or do

4906
01:41:57,350 --> 01:41:57,360
unlikely thing do you mean humans or do
 

4907
01:41:57,360 --> 01:41:59,149
unlikely thing do you mean humans or do
you mean even multicellular organisms

4908
01:41:59,149 --> 01:41:59,159
you mean even multicellular organisms
 

4909
01:41:59,159 --> 01:42:01,189
you mean even multicellular organisms
probably multicellular multicellularity

4910
01:42:01,189 --> 01:42:01,199
probably multicellular multicellularity
 

4911
01:42:01,199 --> 01:42:03,950
probably multicellular multicellularity
it's uh but

4912
01:42:03,950 --> 01:42:03,960
it's uh but
 

4913
01:42:03,960 --> 01:42:06,290
it's uh but
I I understand the

4914
01:42:06,290 --> 01:42:06,300
I I understand the
 

4915
01:42:06,300 --> 01:42:08,689
I I understand the
both sides of the

4916
01:42:08,689 --> 01:42:08,699
both sides of the
 

4917
01:42:08,699 --> 01:42:11,689
both sides of the
equation right in in one level I can see

4918
01:42:11,689 --> 01:42:11,699
equation right in in one level I can see
 

4919
01:42:11,699 --> 01:42:13,189
equation right in in one level I can see
that we may not have any other choice

4920
01:42:13,189 --> 01:42:13,199
that we may not have any other choice
 

4921
01:42:13,199 --> 01:42:15,910
that we may not have any other choice
but to

4922
01:42:15,910 --> 01:42:15,920
but to
 

4923
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:19,250
but to
back up this chemistry somewhere else

4924

back up this chemistry somewhere else
 

4925
01:42:19,260 --> 01:42:21,290
back up this chemistry somewhere else
yeah so you would be saving it's the

4926
01:42:21,290 --> 01:42:21,300
yeah so you would be saving it's the
 

4927
01:42:21,300 --> 01:42:24,590
yeah so you would be saving it's the
ultimate saving or the record our own

4928
01:42:24,590 --> 01:42:24,600
ultimate saving or the record our own
 

4929
01:42:24,600 --> 01:42:27,229
ultimate saving or the record our own
record it's not about you know yes let's

4930
01:42:27,229 --> 01:42:27,239
record it's not about you know yes let's
 

4931
01:42:27,239 --> 01:42:28,669
record it's not about you know yes let's
also save

4932
01:42:28,669 --> 01:42:28,679
also save
 

4933
01:42:28,679 --> 01:42:31,490
also save
um beetles and all the amazing songs but

4934
01:42:31,490 --> 01:42:31,500
um beetles and all the amazing songs but
 

4935
01:42:31,500 --> 01:42:34,430
um beetles and all the amazing songs but
this would be the ultimate repository of

01:42:34,430 --> 01:42:34,440
this would be the ultimate repository of
 

4937
01:42:34,440 --> 01:42:35,510
this would be the ultimate repository of
life

4938

life
 

4939
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:38,030
life
but it's I can also see your point of

4940
01:42:38,030 --> 01:42:38,040
but it's I can also see your point of
 

4941
01:42:38,040 --> 01:42:38,810
but it's I can also see your point of

for sure it's really interesting so like

4944
01:42:41,450 --> 01:42:41,460
for sure it's really interesting so like
 

4945
01:42:41,460 --> 01:42:43,250
for sure it's really interesting so like
don't see the plan with the missing

4946
01:42:43,250 --> 01:42:43,260
don't see the plan with the missing
 

4947
01:42:43,260 --> 01:42:45,770
don't see the plan with the missing
ingredient try to understand what the

4948
01:42:45,770 --> 01:42:45,780
ingredient try to understand what the
 

4949
01:42:45,780 --> 01:42:47,510
ingredient try to understand what the
ingredients it has

4950
01:42:47,510 --> 01:42:47,520

01:42:53,149 --> 01:42:53,159
uh for me for uh from a computer person
 

4955
01:42:53,159 --> 01:42:55,129
uh for me for uh from a computer person
it just feels like something that could

4956
01:42:55,129 --> 01:42:55,139
it just feels like something that could
 

4957
01:42:55,139 --> 01:42:57,590
it just feels like something that could
be solved computationally we can learn

4958
01:42:57,590 --> 01:42:57,600
be solved computationally we can learn
 

4959
01:42:57,600 --> 01:42:59,990
be solved computationally we can learn
from the mistakes that we've done here

4960
01:42:59,990 --> 01:43:00,000
from the mistakes that we've done here
 

4961
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:03,709
from the mistakes that we've done here
and Aspire not to repeat them

4962
01:43:03,709 --> 01:43:03,719
and Aspire not to repeat them
 

4963
01:43:03,719 --> 01:43:06,890

it is possible we do amazing things as

4964
01:43:06,890 --> 01:43:06,900
it is possible we do amazing things as
 

4965
01:43:06,900 --> 01:43:08,510
it is possible we do amazing things as
humans there's a lot of suffering but

4966
01:43:08,510 --> 01:43:08,520
humans there's a lot of suffering but
 

4967
01:43:08,520 --> 01:43:11,450
humans there's a lot of suffering but
there's also a lot of beauty and and we

4968
01:43:11,450 --> 01:43:11,460
there's also a lot of beauty and and we
 

4969
01:43:11,460 --> 01:43:13,910
there's also a lot of beauty and and we
we could choose

4970
01:43:13,910 --> 01:43:13,920
we could choose
 

4971
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:19,609
we could choose
what we want to be or what we want to

4973
01:43:19,619 --> 01:43:22,550

see right so the these attempts don't

out stuff like we've even just a century

4984
01:43:33,649 --> 01:43:33,659
out stuff like we've even just a century
 

4985
01:43:33,659 --> 01:43:35,930
out stuff like we've even just a century

years you see
 

5005
01:43:57,960 --> 01:43:59,410
years you see
yeah

5006
01:43:59,410 --> 01:43:59,420
yeah
 

5007
01:43:59,420 --> 01:44:01,209

that's why I see hope because I think
 

5013
01:44:07,739 --> 01:44:10,669
that's why I see hope because I think
what we get to interact with in

01:44:10,679 --> 01:44:13,629
what we get to interact with in
classrooms every year is getting better

they are aware of issues in a way that I

5018
01:44:17,090 --> 01:44:17,100
they are aware of issues in a way that I
 

5019
01:44:17,100 --> 01:44:20,570
they are aware of issues in a way that I
sure wasn't at their age some levels I

5020
01:44:20,570 --> 01:44:20,580
sure wasn't at their age some levels I
 

5021
01:44:20,580 --> 01:44:22,729
sure wasn't at their age some levels I
was but in many levels I didn't think

5022
01:44:22,729 --> 01:44:22,739
was but in many levels I didn't think
 

5023
01:44:22,739 --> 01:44:25,609
was but in many levels I didn't think
about I I wasn't concerned of the

01:44:25,609 --> 01:44:25,619
about I I wasn't concerned of the
 

5025
01:44:25,619 --> 01:44:27,890
about I I wasn't concerned of the
problems well they maybe have to be

5026
01:44:27,890 --> 01:44:27,900
problems well they maybe have to be
 

5027
01:44:27,900 --> 01:44:30,050
problems well they maybe have to be
concerned because it's hitting the

concerned because it's hitting the
 

5029
01:44:30,060 --> 01:44:32,810
concerned because it's hitting the
reality he's hitting them hard but

01:44:32,810 --> 01:44:32,820
reality he's hitting them hard but
 

5031
01:44:32,820 --> 01:44:34,790

younger people are not afraid of these

5032
01:44:34,790 --> 01:44:34,800
younger people are not afraid of these
 

5033
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:37,070
younger people are not afraid of these
things an 18 year old can face these

5034
01:44:37,070 --> 01:44:37,080
things an 18 year old can face these
 

5035

brutal facts about the planet in ways
 

5037
01:44:38,940 --> 01:44:40,790
brutal facts about the planet in ways
that I don't think any other generation

5038
01:44:40,790 --> 01:44:40,800
that I don't think any other generation
 

5039
01:44:40,800 --> 01:44:43,129
that I don't think any other generation
before them did yeah it's super cool and

5040
01:44:43,129 --> 01:44:43,139
before them did yeah it's super cool and
 

5041
01:44:43,139 --> 01:44:45,109
before them did yeah it's super cool and
and like the uh

5042
01:44:45,109 --> 01:44:45,119
and like the uh
 

5043
01:44:45,119 --> 01:44:46,850
and like the uh
you know there's all these cool

5044
01:44:46,850 --> 01:44:46,860
you know there's all these cool
 

5045
01:44:46,860 --> 01:44:50,090
you know there's all these cool
technologies that Aid in the process

5046
01:44:50,090 --> 01:44:50,100
technologies that Aid in the process
 

5047

of a human being
 

5049
01:44:52,400 --> 01:44:54,830

being able to see the truth the deeper
 

5051
01:44:54,840 --> 01:44:56,570
being able to see the truth the deeper
deeper levels like you know Wikipedia

01:44:56,570 --> 01:44:56,580
deeper levels like you know Wikipedia
 

5053
01:44:56,580 --> 01:44:58,850
deeper levels like you know Wikipedia
and just the internet in general is

5054
01:44:58,850 --> 01:44:58,860
and just the internet in general is
 

5055
01:44:58,860 --> 01:45:00,770
and just the internet in general is
enabling education a level that was

5056
01:45:00,770 --> 01:45:00,780
enabling education a level that was
 

5057
01:45:00,780 --> 01:45:02,810
enabling education a level that was
unimaginable before the internet yes and

5058
01:45:02,810 --> 01:45:02,820
unimaginable before the internet yes and
 

5059
01:45:02,820 --> 01:45:04,790
unimaginable before the internet yes and
I think space exploration

5060
01:45:04,790 --> 01:45:04,800
I think space exploration
 

5061
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:06,890
I think space exploration
even contemplating about these

5062
01:45:06,890 --> 01:45:06,900
even contemplating about these
 

5063
01:45:06,900 --> 01:45:09,470
even contemplating about these
possibilities ultimately and I will

5064
01:45:09,470 --> 01:45:09,480
possibilities ultimately and I will
 

5065
01:45:09,480 --> 01:45:11,510
possibilities ultimately and I will
emphasize this again should make us

5066
01:45:11,510 --> 01:45:11,520
emphasize this again should make us
 

5067
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:13,850
emphasize this again should make us
think about our own place in the

5068
01:45:13,850 --> 01:45:13,860
think about our own place in the
 

5069
01:45:13,860 --> 01:45:16,490
think about our own place in the
universe if we are alone that is quite

5070
01:45:16,490 --> 01:45:16,500
universe if we are alone that is quite
 

5071
01:45:16,500 --> 01:45:18,709
universe if we are alone that is quite
fascinating and we definitely have a

5072
01:45:18,709 --> 01:45:18,719
fascinating and we definitely have a
 

5073
01:45:18,719 --> 01:45:21,050
fascinating and we definitely have a
responsibility to guard what we got

5074
01:45:21,050 --> 01:45:21,060
responsibility to guard what we got
 

5075
01:45:21,060 --> 01:45:22,850
responsibility to guard what we got
better and protect it better and don't

5076
01:45:22,850 --> 01:45:22,860
better and protect it better and don't
 

5077
01:45:22,860 --> 01:45:25,250
better and protect it better and don't
take it for granted if we are not the

5078
01:45:25,250 --> 01:45:25,260
take it for granted if we are not the
 

5079
01:45:25,260 --> 01:45:26,689
take it for granted if we are not the
only one that's also a lot of

5080
01:45:26,689 --> 01:45:26,699
only one that's also a lot of
 

5081
01:45:26,699 --> 01:45:28,790
only one that's also a lot of

what the the proposition I made I like

5496
01:54:10,790 --> 01:54:10,800
what the the proposition I made I like
 

5497
01:54:10,800 --> 01:54:12,890
what the the proposition I made I like
to think of it as protospermia rather

5498
01:54:12,890 --> 01:54:12,900
to think of it as protospermia rather
 

5499
01:54:12,900 --> 01:54:14,930
to think of it as protospermia rather
than panspermia because it seems it's

5500
01:54:14,930 --> 01:54:14,940
than panspermia because it seems it's
 

5501
01:54:14,940 --> 01:54:17,410
than panspermia because it seems it's
even more it's a more proto-state than

5502
01:54:17,410 --> 01:54:17,420
even more it's a more proto-state than
 

5503
01:54:17,420 --> 01:54:20,330
even more it's a more proto-state than
the acknowledging because in in Pan's

01:54:20,330 --> 01:54:20,340
the acknowledging because in in Pan's
 

5505
01:54:20,340 --> 01:54:22,910

01:54:25,250 --> 01:54:25,260
right you still have something that is
 

5509
01:54:25,260 --> 01:54:27,050
right you still have something that is
very even the cell to me would be very

01:55:16,739 --> 01:55:18,530

01:55:20,340 --> 01:55:22,490
room for
those sort of discussions or there will

debates but the problem I have with

5568
01:55:32,229 --> 01:55:32,239
debates but the problem I have with
 

5569
01:55:32,239 --> 01:55:34,370
debates but the problem I have with
panspermia is that it removes the

5570
01:55:34,370 --> 01:55:34,380
panspermia is that it removes the
 

5571
01:55:34,380 --> 01:55:36,229
panspermia is that it removes the
problem from

5572
01:55:36,229 --> 01:55:36,239
problem from
 

5573
01:55:36,239 --> 01:55:40,070
problem from
the planet to somewhere else it makes it

5574
01:55:40,070 --> 01:55:40,080
the planet to somewhere else it makes it
 

5575
01:55:40,080 --> 01:55:42,830
the planet to somewhere else it makes it
very difficult to answer scientifically

5576
01:55:42,830 --> 01:55:42,840
very difficult to answer scientifically
 

5577
01:55:42,840 --> 01:55:45,410
very difficult to answer scientifically
right you you are just you just took the

5578
01:55:45,410 --> 01:55:45,420
right you you are just you just took the
 

5579
01:55:45,420 --> 01:55:49,129
right you you are just you just took the
problem away from this planet and uh

5580
01:55:49,129 --> 01:55:49,139
problem away from this planet and uh
 

5581
01:55:49,139 --> 01:55:52,189
problem away from this planet and uh
formulated in a way that I cannot go and

5582
01:55:52,189 --> 01:55:52,199
formulated in a way that I cannot go and
 

5583
01:55:52,199 --> 01:55:54,290
formulated in a way that I cannot go and
try to understand in the lab doing

5587
01:55:56,460 --> 01:55:58,189
experiments or even through models does
it though so I've heard brilliant

5588
01:55:58,189 --> 01:55:58,199
it though so I've heard brilliant
 

5589
01:55:58,199 --> 01:56:00,530

biologists like yourself say that but I

5590
01:56:00,530 --> 01:56:00,540
biologists like yourself say that but I
 

5591
01:56:00,540 --> 01:56:02,750
biologists like yourself say that but I
I just to me

5592
01:56:02,750 --> 01:56:02,760
I just to me
 

5593
01:56:02,760 --> 01:56:05,810
I just to me
okay here's how I think of Earth so I

5594
01:56:05,810 --> 01:56:05,820
okay here's how I think of Earth so I
 

5595
01:56:05,820 --> 01:56:07,729
okay here's how I think of Earth so I
actually am able to hold all these

5596
01:56:07,729 --> 01:56:07,739
actually am able to hold all these
 

5597
01:56:07,739 --> 01:56:09,830
actually am able to hold all these
possibilities in my head and all of them

5598
01:56:09,830 --> 01:56:09,840
possibilities in my head and all of them
 

5599
01:56:09,840 --> 01:56:11,990
possibilities in my head and all of them
are inspiring to me I kind of think

5600
01:56:11,990 --> 01:56:12,000
are inspiring to me I kind of think
 

5601
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,570
are inspiring to me I kind of think
there's a possibility that Earth is just

5602
01:56:14,570 --> 01:56:14,580
there's a possibility that Earth is just
 

5603
01:56:14,580 --> 01:56:17,390
there's a possibility that Earth is just
an experiment by a graduate student by

5604
01:56:17,390 --> 01:56:17,400
an experiment by a graduate student by
 

5605
01:56:17,400 --> 01:56:20,330
an experiment by a graduate student by
an alien graduate student like so I know

5606
01:56:20,330 --> 01:56:20,340
an alien graduate student like so I know
 

5607
01:56:20,340 --> 01:56:22,129
an alien graduate student like so I know
the exact episodes of Star Trek you're

5608
01:56:22,129 --> 01:56:22,139
the exact episodes of Star Trek you're
 

5609
01:56:22,139 --> 01:56:25,310
the exact episodes of Star Trek you're
talking about but like there is some to

5610
01:56:25,310 --> 01:56:25,320
talking about but like there is some to
 

5611
01:56:25,320 --> 01:56:28,609
talking about but like there is some to
me that's inspiring if we are but that's

5612
01:56:28,609 --> 01:56:28,619
me that's inspiring if we are but that's
 

5613
01:56:28,619 --> 01:56:31,850
me that's inspiring if we are but that's
not what's uh panspermia is about that

5614
01:56:31,850 --> 01:56:31,860
not what's uh panspermia is about that
 

5615
01:56:31,860 --> 01:56:33,590
not what's uh panspermia is about that
you're talking about my proposition

5616
01:56:33,590 --> 01:56:33,600
you're talking about my proposition
 

5617
01:56:33,600 --> 01:56:35,570
you're talking about my proposition
that's not what panspermia is what's

5618
01:56:35,570 --> 01:56:35,580
that's not what panspermia is what's
 

5619
01:56:35,580 --> 01:56:37,970
that's not what panspermia is what's
pants it just oh life just came from

5620
01:56:37,970 --> 01:56:37,980
pants it just oh life just came from
 

5621
01:56:37,980 --> 01:56:39,410
pants it just oh life just came from
elsewhere

5622
01:56:39,410 --> 01:56:39,420
elsewhere
 

5623
01:56:39,420 --> 01:56:41,870
elsewhere
still that's interesting because there's

5624
01:56:41,870 --> 01:56:41,880
still that's interesting because there's
 

5625
01:56:41,880 --> 01:56:44,270
still that's interesting because there's
still giant leaps that happened on Earth

5626
01:56:44,270 --> 01:56:44,280
still giant leaps that happened on Earth
 

5627
01:56:44,280 --> 01:56:46,790
still giant leaps that happened on Earth
it seems like beyond the initial

5628
01:56:46,790 --> 01:56:46,800
it seems like beyond the initial
 

5629
01:56:46,800 --> 01:56:49,490
it seems like beyond the initial
primitive organisms like eukaryotes I

5630
01:56:49,490 --> 01:56:49,500
primitive organisms like eukaryotes I
 

5631
01:56:49,500 --> 01:56:53,709
primitive organisms like eukaryotes I
don't think panspermia I usually uh

5632
01:56:53,709 --> 01:56:53,719
don't think panspermia I usually uh
 

5633
01:56:53,719 --> 01:56:56,390
don't think panspermia I usually uh
articulates at the level of eukaryotes I

5634
01:56:56,390 --> 01:56:56,400
articulates at the level of eukaryotes I
 

5635
01:56:56,400 --> 01:56:58,090
articulates at the level of eukaryotes I
think they talk about

5636
01:56:58,090 --> 01:56:58,100
think they talk about
 

5637
01:56:58,100 --> 01:57:02,330
think they talk about
bacteria primarily I think so right so

5638
01:57:02,330 --> 01:57:02,340
bacteria primarily I think so right so
 

5639
01:57:02,340 --> 01:57:03,410
bacteria primarily I think so right so
that that's still interesting because

5640
01:57:03,410 --> 01:57:03,420
that that's still interesting because
 

5641
01:57:03,420 --> 01:57:04,910
that that's still interesting because
all the different leaps of evolution

5642
01:57:04,910 --> 01:57:04,920
all the different leaps of evolution
 

5643
01:57:04,920 --> 01:57:06,470
all the different leaps of evolution
still happen here on Earth that's still

5644
01:57:06,470 --> 01:57:06,480
still happen here on Earth that's still
 

5645
01:57:06,480 --> 01:57:09,169
still happen here on Earth that's still
interesting yeah but it's I mean it's

5646
01:57:09,169 --> 01:57:09,179
interesting yeah but it's I mean it's
 

5647
01:57:09,179 --> 01:57:10,550
interesting yeah but it's I mean it's
definitely

5648
01:57:10,550 --> 01:57:10,560
definitely
 

5649
01:57:10,560 --> 01:57:11,990
definitely
um

5650
01:57:11,990 --> 01:57:12,000
um
 

5651
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,030
um
interesting to listen to but I I

5652
01:57:14,030 --> 01:57:14,040
interesting to listen to but I I
 

5653
01:57:14,040 --> 01:57:16,970
interesting to listen to but I I
wouldn't uh place it you know I wouldn't

5654
01:57:16,970 --> 01:57:16,980
wouldn't uh place it you know I wouldn't
 

5655
01:57:16,980 --> 01:57:19,129
wouldn't uh place it you know I wouldn't
know how to place it in the studies of

5656
01:57:19,129 --> 01:57:19,139
know how to place it in the studies of
 

5657
01:57:19,139 --> 01:57:21,050
know how to place it in the studies of
origin of life I guess or early yes I

5658
01:57:21,050 --> 01:57:21,060
origin of life I guess or early yes I
 

5659
01:57:21,060 --> 01:57:22,550
origin of life I guess or early yes I
will place it you have the initial

5660
01:57:22,550 --> 01:57:22,560
will place it you have the initial
 

5661
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:25,129
will place it you have the initial
conditions for the origin of life and

5662
01:57:25,129 --> 01:57:25,139
conditions for the origin of life and
 

5663
01:57:25,139 --> 01:57:28,129
conditions for the origin of life and
you try to create life in that way that

5664
01:57:28,129 --> 01:57:28,139
you try to create life in that way that
 

5665
01:57:28,139 --> 01:57:29,930
you try to create life in that way that
you've described in the five components

5666
01:57:29,930 --> 01:57:29,940
you've described in the five components
 

5667
01:57:29,940 --> 01:57:31,970
you've described in the five components
and it keeps failing

5668
01:57:31,970 --> 01:57:31,980
and it keeps failing
 

5669
01:57:31,980 --> 01:57:34,790
and it keeps failing
see what what pantspermia allows you to

5670
01:57:34,790 --> 01:57:34,800
see what what pantspermia allows you to
 

5671
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:38,750
see what what pantspermia allows you to
do is to also consider the question

5672
01:57:38,750 --> 01:57:38,760
do is to also consider the question
 

5673
01:57:38,760 --> 01:57:41,510
do is to also consider the question
maybe there's missing components how do

5674
01:57:41,510 --> 01:57:41,520
maybe there's missing components how do
 

5675
01:57:41,520 --> 01:57:43,010
maybe there's missing components how do
you answer that question

5676
01:57:43,010 --> 01:57:43,020
you answer that question
 

5677
01:57:43,020 --> 01:57:45,530
you answer that question
to exploration and through science yes

5678
01:57:45,530 --> 01:57:45,540
to exploration and through science yes
 

5679
01:57:45,540 --> 01:57:48,050
to exploration and through science yes

looking at the fundamentals of chemistry
 

5683
01:57:50,400 --> 01:57:52,430
looking at the fundamentals of chemistry
and physics how do you understand that

5684
01:57:52,430 --> 01:57:52,440
and physics how do you understand that
 

5685
01:57:52,440 --> 01:57:54,290
and physics how do you understand that
with fundamentals of chemistry and

01:57:57,060 --> 01:57:58,609
physics how do you understand how do you
understand the gravity but you're

5690
01:57:58,609 --> 01:57:58,619
understand the gravity but you're
 

5691
01:57:58,619 --> 01:58:00,890
understand the gravity but you're
talking about panspermia right just I

5692
01:58:00,890 --> 01:58:00,900
talking about panspermia right just I
 

5693
01:58:00,900 --> 01:58:02,870
talking about panspermia right just I
don't understand how would you it's

5694
01:58:02,870 --> 01:58:02,880
don't understand how would you it's
 

5695
01:58:02,880 --> 01:58:04,850
don't understand how would you it's
different than if if you think it's

5696
01:58:04,850 --> 01:58:04,860
different than if if you think it's
 

5697
01:58:04,860 --> 01:58:06,830
different than if if you think it's
similar to looking for life in the

5698
01:58:06,830 --> 01:58:06,840
similar to looking for life in the
 

5699
01:58:06,840 --> 01:58:08,990
similar to looking for life in the
universe is that what you're thinking no

5700
01:58:08,990 --> 01:58:09,000
universe is that what you're thinking no
 

5701
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:10,609
universe is that what you're thinking no
I'm saying there's a missing component

5702
01:58:10,609 --> 01:58:10,619
I'm saying there's a missing component
 

5703
01:58:10,619 --> 01:58:13,070
I'm saying there's a missing component
that came from elsewhere but the whole

5704
01:58:13,070 --> 01:58:13,080
that came from elsewhere but the whole
 

5705
01:58:13,080 --> 01:58:14,330
that came from elsewhere but the whole
entire organism is not a missing

5706
01:58:14,330 --> 01:58:14,340
entire organism is not a missing
 

5707
01:58:14,340 --> 01:58:15,950
entire organism is not a missing
component like that right I mean when

5708
01:58:15,950 --> 01:58:15,960
component like that right I mean when
 

5709
01:58:15,960 --> 01:58:17,750
component like that right I mean when
you're thinking about origin of life no

5710
01:58:17,750 --> 01:58:17,760
you're thinking about origin of life no
 

5711
01:58:17,760 --> 01:58:19,970
you're thinking about origin of life no
no no that that's an assumption your

5712
01:58:19,970 --> 01:58:19,980
no no that that's an assumption your
 

5713
01:58:19,980 --> 01:58:22,490
no no that that's an assumption your
your assumption is all the ingredients

5714
01:58:22,490 --> 01:58:22,500
your assumption is all the ingredients
 

5715
01:58:22,500 --> 01:58:24,530
your assumption is all the ingredients
for the origin of Life are here on Earth

5716
01:58:24,530 --> 01:58:24,540
for the origin of Life are here on Earth
 

5717
01:58:24,540 --> 01:58:26,930
for the origin of Life are here on Earth
now I tend to believe that most likely

5718
01:58:26,930 --> 01:58:26,940
now I tend to believe that most likely
 

5719
01:58:26,940 --> 01:58:29,030
now I tend to believe that most likely
that's the case I'm just saying it's

5720
01:58:29,030 --> 01:58:29,040
that's the case I'm just saying it's
 

5721
01:58:29,040 --> 01:58:31,729
that's the case I'm just saying it's
inspiring to think that there is some

5722
01:58:31,729 --> 01:58:31,739
inspiring to think that there is some
 

5723
01:58:31,739 --> 01:58:33,229
inspiring to think that there is some
ingredients

5724
01:58:33,229 --> 01:58:33,239
ingredients
 

5725
01:58:33,239 --> 01:58:34,490
ingredients
you're going to push back because that's

5726
01:58:34,490 --> 01:58:34,500
you're going to push back because that's
 

5727
01:58:34,500 --> 01:58:37,209
you're going to push back because that's
not past perm yeah that's promised but

5728
01:58:37,209 --> 01:58:37,219
not past perm yeah that's promised but
 

5729
01:58:37,219 --> 01:58:39,790
not past perm yeah that's promised but
see okay so think

5730
01:58:39,790 --> 01:58:39,800
see okay so think
 

5731
01:58:39,800 --> 01:58:42,530
see okay so think
but yeah it's also kind of fun to push

5732
01:58:42,530 --> 01:58:42,540
but yeah it's also kind of fun to push
 

5733
01:58:42,540 --> 01:58:46,070
but yeah it's also kind of fun to push
back on you uh no I I I understand I

5734
01:58:46,070 --> 01:58:46,080
back on you uh no I I I understand I
 

5735
01:58:46,080 --> 01:58:47,990
back on you uh no I I I understand I
understand I understand if actually a

5736
01:58:47,990 --> 01:58:48,000
understand I understand if actually a
 

5737
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:49,669
understand I understand if actually a
living organism

5738
01:58:49,669 --> 01:58:49,679
living organism
 

5739
01:58:49,679 --> 01:58:52,729
living organism
ended up here from elsewhere that means

5740
01:58:52,729 --> 01:58:52,739
ended up here from elsewhere that means
 

5741
01:58:52,739 --> 01:58:54,470
ended up here from elsewhere that means
a lot of the exploration we're doing

5742
01:58:54,470 --> 01:58:54,480
a lot of the exploration we're doing
 

5743
01:58:54,480 --> 01:58:56,209
a lot of the exploration we're doing
here with the ingredients that we know

5744
01:58:56,209 --> 01:58:56,219
here with the ingredients that we know
 

5745
01:58:56,219 --> 01:59:00,169
here with the ingredients that we know
will not give us the clues to the

5746
01:59:00,169 --> 01:59:00,179
will not give us the clues to the
 

5747
01:59:00,179 --> 01:59:03,350
will not give us the clues to the
um to the origin of life but it just

5748
01:59:03,350 --> 01:59:03,360
um to the origin of life but it just
 

5749
01:59:03,360 --> 01:59:05,750
um to the origin of life but it just
seems like

5750
01:59:05,750 --> 01:59:05,760
seems like
 

5751
01:59:05,760 --> 01:59:08,530
seems like
it's still very useful to try to create

5752
01:59:08,530 --> 01:59:08,540
it's still very useful to try to create
 

5753
01:59:08,540 --> 01:59:11,810
it's still very useful to try to create
life here and then we'll see wait a

5754
01:59:11,810 --> 01:59:11,820
life here and then we'll see wait a
 

5755
01:59:11,820 --> 01:59:14,450
life here and then we'll see wait a
minute don't you think we'll be able to

5756
01:59:14,450 --> 01:59:14,460
minute don't you think we'll be able to
 

5757
01:59:14,460 --> 01:59:17,270
minute don't you think we'll be able to
prove not prove but show that past Burma

5758
01:59:17,270 --> 01:59:17,280
prove not prove but show that past Burma
 

5759
01:59:17,280 --> 01:59:18,470
prove not prove but show that past Burma
is very likely

5760
01:59:18,470 --> 01:59:18,480
is very likely
 

5761
01:59:18,480 --> 01:59:20,810
is very likely
like if we just keep failing we

5762
01:59:20,810 --> 01:59:20,820
like if we just keep failing we
 

5763
01:59:20,820 --> 01:59:24,050
like if we just keep failing we
understand biology deeply I don't I

5764
01:59:24,050 --> 01:59:24,060
understand biology deeply I don't I
 

5765
01:59:24,060 --> 01:59:26,629
understand biology deeply I don't I
don't think so I mean there there will

5766
01:59:26,629 --> 01:59:26,639
don't think so I mean there there will
 

5767
01:59:26,639 --> 01:59:29,209
don't think so I mean there there will
be the failure is is not going to

5768
01:59:29,209 --> 01:59:29,219
be the failure is is not going to
 

5769
01:59:29,219 --> 01:59:31,729
be the failure is is not going to
indicate that this must have been I

5770
01:59:31,729 --> 01:59:31,739
indicate that this must have been I
 

5771
01:59:31,739 --> 01:59:34,189
indicate that this must have been I
don't think anyone will put the problem

5772
01:59:34,189 --> 01:59:34,199
don't think anyone will put the problem
 

5773
01:59:34,199 --> 01:59:37,010
don't think anyone will put the problem
to some some something else just because

5774
01:59:37,010 --> 01:59:37,020
to some some something else just because
 

5775
01:59:37,020 --> 01:59:40,010
to some some something else just because
our failures our experiments failed so

5776
01:59:40,010 --> 01:59:40,020
our failures our experiments failed so
 

5777
01:59:40,020 --> 01:59:41,390
our failures our experiments failed so
failure means we don't understand the

5778
01:59:41,390 --> 01:59:41,400
failure means we don't understand the
 

5779
01:59:41,400 --> 01:59:43,490
failure means we don't understand the
chemistry deeply enough yeah and we've

5780
01:59:43,490 --> 01:59:43,500
chemistry deeply enough yeah and we've
 

5781
01:59:43,500 --> 01:59:46,310
chemistry deeply enough yeah and we've
given the progress we made and how many

5782
01:59:46,310 --> 01:59:46,320
given the progress we made and how many
 

5783
01:59:46,320 --> 01:59:47,750
given the progress we made and how many
brilliant people are working on this

5784
01:59:47,750 --> 01:59:47,760
brilliant people are working on this
 

5785
01:59:47,760 --> 01:59:52,010
brilliant people are working on this
right now and it's definitely more I

5786
01:59:52,010 --> 01:59:52,020
right now and it's definitely more I
 

5787
01:59:52,020 --> 01:59:53,629
right now and it's definitely more I
would say that we are approaching this

5788
01:59:53,629 --> 01:59:53,639
would say that we are approaching this
 

5789
01:59:53,639 --> 01:59:55,790
would say that we are approaching this
problem in more broader ways with

5790
01:59:55,790 --> 01:59:55,800
problem in more broader ways with
 

5791
01:59:55,800 --> 01:59:58,189
problem in more broader ways with
different ways possible I'm confident

5792
01:59:58,189 --> 01:59:58,199
different ways possible I'm confident
 

5793
01:59:58,199 --> 02:00:01,070
different ways possible I'm confident
that we will get there for for us again

5794
02:00:01,070 --> 02:00:01,080
that we will get there for for us again
 

5795
02:00:01,080 --> 02:00:03,350
that we will get there for for us again
very interested in if

5796
02:00:03,350 --> 02:00:03,360
very interested in if
 

5797
02:00:03,360 --> 02:00:05,209
very interested in if
early souls and first cells and what

5798
02:00:05,209 --> 02:00:05,219
early souls and first cells and what
 

5799
02:00:05,219 --> 02:00:06,530
early souls and first cells and what
followed the origin of life but we

5800
02:00:06,530 --> 02:00:06,540
followed the origin of life but we
 

5801
02:00:06,540 --> 02:00:08,689
followed the origin of life but we
cannot be given that it's a Continuum

5802
02:00:08,689 --> 02:00:08,699
cannot be given that it's a Continuum
 

5803
02:00:08,699 --> 02:00:12,050
cannot be given that it's a Continuum
that's the between the origin and

5804
02:00:12,050 --> 02:00:12,060
that's the between the origin and
 

5805
02:00:12,060 --> 02:00:14,470
that's the between the origin and
emergence of first cells it's hard to

5806
02:00:14,470 --> 02:00:14,480
emergence of first cells it's hard to
 

5807
02:00:14,480 --> 02:00:17,390
emergence of first cells it's hard to
separate these two ends from one another

5808
02:00:17,390 --> 02:00:17,400
separate these two ends from one another
 

5809
02:00:17,400 --> 02:00:20,270
separate these two ends from one another
so given that life is a solution to a

5810
02:00:20,270 --> 02:00:20,280
so given that life is a solution to a
 

5811
02:00:20,280 --> 02:00:24,350
so given that life is a solution to a
chemistry problem if we re-ran Earth a

5812
02:00:24,350 --> 02:00:24,360
chemistry problem if we re-ran Earth a
 

5813
02:00:24,360 --> 02:00:27,229
chemistry problem if we re-ran Earth a
million times how different would

5814
02:00:27,229 --> 02:00:27,239
million times how different would
 

5815
02:00:27,239 --> 02:00:28,970
million times how different would
the results be

5816
02:00:28,970 --> 02:00:28,980
the results be
 

5817
02:00:28,980 --> 02:00:31,550
the results be
if we look at that wheel

5818
02:00:31,550 --> 02:00:31,560
if we look at that wheel
 

5819
02:00:31,560 --> 02:00:33,770
if we look at that wheel
how different would be the the Tree of

5820
02:00:33,770 --> 02:00:33,780
how different would be the the Tree of
 

5821
02:00:33,780 --> 02:00:35,510
how different would be the the Tree of
Life do you think like what's Your Gut

5822
02:00:35,510 --> 02:00:35,520
Life do you think like what's Your Gut
 

5823
02:00:35,520 --> 02:00:37,370
Life do you think like what's Your Gut
say

5824
02:00:37,370 --> 02:00:37,380
say
 

5825
02:00:37,380 --> 02:00:42,410
say
my uh mind asks are you imagining if if

5826
02:00:42,410 --> 02:00:42,420
my uh mind asks are you imagining if if
 

5827
02:00:42,420 --> 02:00:44,209
my uh mind asks are you imagining if if
we're repeating the planet one million

5828
02:00:44,209 --> 02:00:44,219
we're repeating the planet one million
 

5829
02:00:44,219 --> 02:00:48,050
we're repeating the planet one million
times are we seeing

5830
02:00:48,050 --> 02:00:48,060
times are we seeing
 

5831
02:00:48,060 --> 02:00:50,990
times are we seeing
um artists things that happened I'm not

5832
02:00:50,990 --> 02:00:51,000
um artists things that happened I'm not
 

5833
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:52,729
um artists things that happened I'm not
talking at the chemical level but at the

5834
02:00:52,729 --> 02:00:52,739
talking at the chemical level but at the
 

5835
02:00:52,739 --> 02:00:55,609
talking at the chemical level but at the
environment level did do they happen at

5836
02:00:55,609 --> 02:00:55,619
environment level did do they happen at
 

5837
02:00:55,619 --> 02:00:57,350
environment level did do they happen at
the same time at the same frequency at

5838
02:00:57,350 --> 02:00:57,360
the same time at the same frequency at
 

5839
02:00:57,360 --> 02:00:59,689
the same time at the same frequency at
the same intensity every time you're

5840
02:00:59,689 --> 02:00:59,699
the same intensity every time you're
 

5841
02:00:59,699 --> 02:01:01,490
the same intensity every time you're
running this tape over and over again

5842
02:01:01,490 --> 02:01:01,500
running this tape over and over again
 

5843
02:01:01,500 --> 02:01:04,490
running this tape over and over again
yes you mean like geological stuff yeah

5844
02:01:04,490 --> 02:01:04,500
yes you mean like geological stuff yeah
 

5845
02:01:04,500 --> 02:01:06,290
yes you mean like geological stuff yeah
like so is this your singles are

5846
02:01:06,290 --> 02:01:06,300
like so is this your singles are
 

5847
02:01:06,300 --> 02:01:08,089
like so is this your singles are
important I mean that's that's yep the

5848
02:01:08,089 --> 02:01:08,099
important I mean that's that's yep the
 

5849
02:01:08,099 --> 02:01:09,950
important I mean that's that's yep the
fact that you would ask that question is

5850
02:01:09,950 --> 02:01:09,960
fact that you would ask that question is
 

5851
02:01:09,960 --> 02:01:11,689
fact that you would ask that question is
also fascinating so that's important the

5852
02:01:11,689 --> 02:01:11,699
also fascinating so that's important the
 

5853
02:01:11,699 --> 02:01:14,629
also fascinating so that's important the
timing the frequency the intensity of

5854
02:01:14,629 --> 02:01:14,639
timing the frequency the intensity of
 

5855
02:01:14,639 --> 02:01:16,490
timing the frequency the intensity of
geological yeah so when when we run this

5856
02:01:16,490 --> 02:01:16,500
geological yeah so when when we run this
 

5857
02:01:16,500 --> 02:01:18,649
geological yeah so when when we run this
imaginary rewind and play experiments in

5858
02:01:18,649 --> 02:01:18,659
imaginary rewind and play experiments in
 

5859
02:01:18,659 --> 02:01:21,350
imaginary rewind and play experiments in
our minds I want to know whether we are

5860
02:01:21,350 --> 02:01:21,360
our minds I want to know whether we are
 

5861
02:01:21,360 --> 02:01:23,810
our minds I want to know whether we are
positioning all the same geologic events

5862
02:01:23,810 --> 02:01:23,820
positioning all the same geologic events
 

5863
02:01:23,820 --> 02:01:25,609
positioning all the same geologic events
at the same chronological order as well

5864
02:01:25,609 --> 02:01:25,619
at the same chronological order as well
 

5865
02:01:25,619 --> 02:01:27,770
at the same chronological order as well
or whether we are also giving them more

5866
02:01:27,770 --> 02:01:27,780
or whether we are also giving them more
 

5867
02:01:27,780 --> 02:01:28,790
or whether we are also giving them more
randomness

5868
02:01:28,790 --> 02:01:28,800
randomness
 

5869
02:01:28,800 --> 02:01:31,070
randomness
so if the volcano erupted is happening

5870
02:01:31,070 --> 02:01:31,080
so if the volcano erupted is happening
 

5871
02:01:31,080 --> 02:01:33,830
so if the volcano erupted is happening
at the same time if if you have a are

5872
02:01:33,830 --> 02:01:33,840
at the same time if if you have a are
 

5873
02:01:33,840 --> 02:01:35,209
at the same time if if you have a are
dinosaurs getting wiped off every time

5874
02:01:35,209 --> 02:01:35,219
dinosaurs getting wiped off every time
 

5875
02:01:35,219 --> 02:01:37,790
dinosaurs getting wiped off every time
with the same meteorite that's hitting

5876
02:01:37,790 --> 02:01:37,800
with the same meteorite that's hitting
 

5877
02:01:37,800 --> 02:01:38,930
with the same meteorite that's hitting
the same but also like temperature

5878
02:01:38,930 --> 02:01:38,940
the same but also like temperature
 

5879
02:01:38,940 --> 02:01:41,209
the same but also like temperature
changes that changes everything

5880
02:01:41,209 --> 02:01:41,219
changes that changes everything
 

5881
02:01:41,219 --> 02:01:43,070
changes that changes everything
that's actually I've heard you say

5882
02:01:43,070 --> 02:01:43,080
that's actually I've heard you say
 

5883
02:01:43,080 --> 02:01:45,169
that's actually I've heard you say
somewhere that one of the things that's

5884
02:01:45,169 --> 02:01:45,179
somewhere that one of the things that's
 

5885
02:01:45,179 --> 02:01:47,089
somewhere that one of the things that's
fascinating to you about this whole

5886
02:01:47,089 --> 02:01:47,099
fascinating to you about this whole
 

5887
02:01:47,099 --> 02:01:50,270
fascinating to you about this whole
process of evolution is that

5888
02:01:50,270 --> 02:01:50,280
process of evolution is that
 

5889
02:01:50,280 --> 02:01:53,270
process of evolution is that
the the mem the memory the the process

5890
02:01:53,270 --> 02:01:53,280
the the mem the memory the the process
 

5891
02:01:53,280 --> 02:01:55,070
the the mem the memory the the process
of evolution the all the mechanisms were

5892
02:01:55,070 --> 02:01:55,080
of evolution the all the mechanisms were
 

5893
02:01:55,080 --> 02:01:57,370
of evolution the all the mechanisms were
invented and developed

5894
02:01:57,370 --> 02:01:57,380
invented and developed
 

5895
02:01:57,380 --> 02:02:00,169
invented and developed
despite all the variation geologically

5896
02:02:00,169 --> 02:02:00,179
despite all the variation geologically
 

5897
02:02:00,179 --> 02:02:02,450
despite all the variation geologically
through the hardship that Earth has gone

5898
02:02:02,450 --> 02:02:02,460
through the hardship that Earth has gone

02:02:02,460 --> 02:02:04,490
through the hardship that Earth has gone
through that the the biological

Innovations persisted this person yeah

5902
02:02:06,890 --> 02:02:06,900
Innovations persisted this person yeah
 

5903
02:02:06,900 --> 02:02:08,990

02:02:08,990 --> 02:02:09,000
despite that which is which is
 

5905
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:11,510
despite that which is which is
interesting you kind of think of the

5906
02:02:11,510 --> 02:02:11,520
interesting you kind of think of the
 

5907
02:02:11,520 --> 02:02:13,070
interesting you kind of think of the
biological Innovations kind of happening

5908
02:02:13,070 --> 02:02:13,080
biological Innovations kind of happening
 

5909
02:02:13,080 --> 02:02:15,709
biological Innovations kind of happening
on their own because we so we uh

5910
02:02:15,709 --> 02:02:15,719
on their own because we so we uh
 

5911
02:02:15,719 --> 02:02:17,930
on their own because we so we uh
actually have a center of exploring this

5912
02:02:17,930 --> 02:02:17,940
actually have a center of exploring this
 

5913
02:02:17,940 --> 02:02:21,290
actually have a center of exploring this
problem uh we want to understand whether

5914
02:02:21,290 --> 02:02:21,300
problem uh we want to understand whether

it's almost like judging a book by its

5916
02:02:23,390 --> 02:02:23,400
it's almost like judging a book by its
 

5917
02:02:23,400 --> 02:02:25,189
it's almost like judging a book by its
cover right do you just look at an

5918
02:02:25,189 --> 02:02:25,199
cover right do you just look at an
 

5919
02:02:25,199 --> 02:02:27,290
cover right do you just look at an
environment and then see whatever is

5920
02:02:27,290 --> 02:02:27,300
environment and then see whatever is
 

5921
02:02:27,300 --> 02:02:29,870
environment and then see whatever is
present or scares in that environment

5922
02:02:29,870 --> 02:02:29,880
present or scares in that environment
 

5923
02:02:29,880 --> 02:02:32,209
present or scares in that environment
and then think that okay the life form

5924
02:02:32,209 --> 02:02:32,219
and then think that okay the life form
 

5925
02:02:32,219 --> 02:02:34,490
and then think that okay the life form
that will exist in this environment will

5926
02:02:34,490 --> 02:02:34,500
that will exist in this environment will
 

5927
02:02:34,500 --> 02:02:37,550
that will exist in this environment will
obviously have a lot of molybdenum in

5928
02:02:37,550 --> 02:02:37,560
obviously have a lot of molybdenum in
 

5929
02:02:37,560 --> 02:02:39,410
obviously have a lot of molybdenum in
its system look at all this bully them

5930
02:02:39,410 --> 02:02:39,420
its system look at all this bully them
 

5931
02:02:39,420 --> 02:02:43,250
its system look at all this bully them
around here or will it be uh because if

5932
02:02:43,250 --> 02:02:43,260
around here or will it be uh because if
 

5933
02:02:43,260 --> 02:02:45,050
around here or will it be uh because if
you say that you are now putting the

5934
02:02:45,050 --> 02:02:45,060
you say that you are now putting the
 

5935
02:02:45,060 --> 02:02:46,810
you say that you are now putting the

5936
02:02:46,810 --> 02:02:46,820
environment in in
 

5937
02:02:46,820 --> 02:02:49,970
environment in in
the more Prime driver role right that

5938
02:02:49,970 --> 02:02:49,980
the more Prime driver role right that
 

5939
02:02:49,980 --> 02:02:51,410
the more Prime driver role right that
you're saying that environment will

02:02:51,410 --> 02:02:51,420
you're saying that environment will
 

5941
02:02:51,420 --> 02:02:53,810
you're saying that environment will
determine what biology will or will not

5942
02:02:53,810 --> 02:02:53,820
determine what biology will or will not
 

5943
02:02:53,820 --> 02:02:55,609

02:02:55,609 --> 02:02:55,619
use
 

5945
02:02:55,619 --> 02:02:59,209
use
um but we've done studies that

5946
02:02:59,209 --> 02:02:59,219
um but we've done studies that
 

5947
02:02:59,219 --> 02:03:01,370
um but we've done studies that
show that it's not necessarily the

5948
02:03:01,370 --> 02:03:01,380
show that it's not necessarily the
 

5949
02:03:01,380 --> 02:03:03,649
show that it's not necessarily the
straightforward that for instance we

5950
02:03:03,649 --> 02:03:03,659
straightforward that for instance we
 

5951
02:03:03,659 --> 02:03:06,649
straightforward that for instance we
looked at going back to nitrogen uh one

5952
02:03:06,649 --> 02:03:06,659
looked at going back to nitrogen uh one
 

5953
02:03:06,659 --> 02:03:08,990
looked at going back to nitrogen uh one
thing that's fascinating about the way

5954
02:03:08,990 --> 02:03:09,000
thing that's fascinating about the way
 

5955
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:12,290
thing that's fascinating about the way
cells fix nitrogen uh the ones that can

5956
02:03:12,290 --> 02:03:12,300
cells fix nitrogen uh the ones that can
 

5957
02:03:12,300 --> 02:03:16,070
cells fix nitrogen uh the ones that can
do is that they also do this through a

5958
02:03:16,070 --> 02:03:16,080
do is that they also do this through a
 

5959
02:03:16,080 --> 02:03:18,050
do is that they also do this through a
lot of help of a lot of metals a lot of

5960
02:03:18,050 --> 02:03:18,060
lot of help of a lot of metals a lot of
 

5961
02:03:18,060 --> 02:03:20,390
lot of help of a lot of metals a lot of
Elemental support really

5962
02:03:20,390 --> 02:03:20,400
Elemental support really
 

5963
02:03:20,400 --> 02:03:22,490
Elemental support really
and

5964
02:03:22,490 --> 02:03:22,500
and
 

5965
02:03:22,500 --> 02:03:25,850
and
um which geologists use to understand

5966
02:03:25,850 --> 02:03:25,860
um which geologists use to understand
 

5967
02:03:25,860 --> 02:03:28,970
um which geologists use to understand
where did this metabolism even evolved

5968
02:03:28,970 --> 02:03:28,980
where did this metabolism even evolved
 

5969
02:03:28,980 --> 02:03:31,490
where did this metabolism even evolved
where at first place so we look at

5970
02:03:31,490 --> 02:03:31,500
where at first place so we look at
 

5971
02:03:31,500 --> 02:03:33,410
where at first place so we look at
ancient oceans we try to understand the

5972
02:03:33,410 --> 02:03:33,420
ancient oceans we try to understand the
 

5973
02:03:33,420 --> 02:03:35,290
ancient oceans we try to understand the
elemental composition of ancient oceans

5974
02:03:35,290 --> 02:03:35,300
elemental composition of ancient oceans
 

5975
02:03:35,300 --> 02:03:38,390
elemental composition of ancient oceans
and what we see is that

5976
02:03:38,390 --> 02:03:38,400
and what we see is that
 

5977
02:03:38,400 --> 02:03:40,669
and what we see is that
in some cases the metabolisms even

5978
02:03:40,669 --> 02:03:40,679
in some cases the metabolisms even
 

5979
02:03:40,679 --> 02:03:43,010
in some cases the metabolisms even
though they prefer a certain metal or an

5980
02:03:43,010 --> 02:03:43,020
though they prefer a certain metal or an
 

5981
02:03:43,020 --> 02:03:45,709
though they prefer a certain metal or an
element that is in the environment

5982
02:03:45,709 --> 02:03:45,719
element that is in the environment
 

5983
02:03:45,719 --> 02:03:48,109
element that is in the environment
that metal wasn't abundant in the

5984
02:03:48,109 --> 02:03:48,119
that metal wasn't abundant in the
 

5985
02:03:48,119 --> 02:03:51,530
that metal wasn't abundant in the
environment but still life shows that so

5986
02:03:51,530 --> 02:03:51,540
environment but still life shows that so
 

5987
02:03:51,540 --> 02:03:53,390
environment but still life shows that so
it's not that straightforward as though

5988
02:03:53,390 --> 02:03:53,400
it's not that straightforward as though
 

5989
02:03:53,400 --> 02:03:56,629
it's not that straightforward as though
whatever you are you are what you eat

5990
02:03:56,629 --> 02:03:56,639
whatever you are you are what you eat
 

5991
02:03:56,639 --> 02:03:58,430
whatever you are you are what you eat
but you don't necessarily eat what is

5992
02:03:58,430 --> 02:03:58,440
but you don't necessarily eat what is
 

5993
02:03:58,440 --> 02:04:00,530
but you don't necessarily eat what is
obvious to you and just because there's

5994
02:04:00,530 --> 02:04:00,540
obvious to you and just because there's
 

5995
02:04:00,540 --> 02:04:01,910
obvious to you and just because there's
a lot of that food around it doesn't

5996
02:04:01,910 --> 02:04:01,920
a lot of that food around it doesn't
 

5997
02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:03,589
a lot of that food around it doesn't
mean life will ultimately go there maybe

5998
02:04:03,589 --> 02:04:03,599
mean life will ultimately go there maybe
 

5999
02:04:03,599 --> 02:04:05,810
mean life will ultimately go there maybe
most of the time it will but it seems

6000
02:04:05,810 --> 02:04:05,820
most of the time it will but it seems
 

6001
02:04:05,820 --> 02:04:07,790
most of the time it will but it seems
like in the case of nitrogen fixation it

6002
02:04:07,790 --> 02:04:07,800
like in the case of nitrogen fixation it
 

6003
02:04:07,800 --> 02:04:08,990
like in the case of nitrogen fixation it
didn't and maybe that made the

6004
02:04:08,990 --> 02:04:09,000
didn't and maybe that made the
 

6005
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,209
didn't and maybe that made the
difference it's so cool that uh right

6006
02:04:11,209 --> 02:04:11,219
difference it's so cool that uh right
 

6007
02:04:11,219 --> 02:04:12,709
difference it's so cool that uh right
it's not the Abundant resource that's

6008
02:04:12,709 --> 02:04:12,719
it's not the Abundant resource that's
 

6009
02:04:12,719 --> 02:04:14,689
it's not the Abundant resource that's
going to be the definition of what kind

6010
02:04:14,689 --> 02:04:14,699
going to be the definition of what kind
 

6011
02:04:14,699 --> 02:04:16,570
going to be the definition of what kind
of life flourishes

6012
02:04:16,570 --> 02:04:16,580
of life flourishes
 

6013
02:04:16,580 --> 02:04:18,229
of life flourishes
so

6014
02:04:18,229 --> 02:04:18,239
so
 

6015
02:04:18,239 --> 02:04:20,270
so
so it's not it's not a straightforward

6016
02:04:20,270 --> 02:04:20,280
so it's not it's not a straightforward
 

6017
02:04:20,280 --> 02:04:23,689
so it's not it's not a straightforward
thing yes but your sense is that the

6018
02:04:23,689 --> 02:04:23,699
thing yes but your sense is that the
 

6019
02:04:23,699 --> 02:04:25,430
thing yes but your sense is that the
different timing of the different

6020
02:04:25,430 --> 02:04:25,440
different timing of the different
 

6021
02:04:25,440 --> 02:04:27,169
different timing of the different
conditions of the environment would

6022
02:04:27,169 --> 02:04:27,179
conditions of the environment would
 

6023
02:04:27,179 --> 02:04:30,050
conditions of the environment would
change the way Evolution happens yeah

6024
02:04:30,050 --> 02:04:30,060
change the way Evolution happens yeah
 

6025
02:04:30,060 --> 02:04:32,149
change the way Evolution happens yeah
for instance I mean there I think it's

6026
02:04:32,149 --> 02:04:32,159
for instance I mean there I think it's
 

6027
02:04:32,159 --> 02:04:34,970
for instance I mean there I think it's
in the 80s maybe earlier than that the

6028
02:04:34,970 --> 02:04:34,980
in the 80s maybe earlier than that the
 

6029
02:04:34,980 --> 02:04:37,250
in the 80s maybe earlier than that the
Stephen J Gold's book Wonderful Life

6030
02:04:37,250 --> 02:04:37,260
Stephen J Gold's book Wonderful Life
 

6031
02:04:37,260 --> 02:04:40,010
Stephen J Gold's book Wonderful Life
which changed I think a lot of

6032
02:04:40,010 --> 02:04:40,020
which changed I think a lot of
 

6033
02:04:40,020 --> 02:04:43,609
which changed I think a lot of
scientists life including mine

6034
02:04:43,609 --> 02:04:43,619
scientists life including mine
 

6035
02:04:43,619 --> 02:04:47,930
scientists life including mine
um he contemplates on this notion of the

6036
02:04:47,930 --> 02:04:47,940
um he contemplates on this notion of the
 

6037
02:04:47,940 --> 02:04:49,850
um he contemplates on this notion of the
tape of Life Of course

6038
02:04:49,850 --> 02:04:49,860
tape of Life Of course
 

6039
02:04:49,860 --> 02:04:51,410
tape of Life Of course
I hope people still know what tape is

6040
02:04:51,410 --> 02:04:51,420
I hope people still know what tape is
 

6041
02:04:51,420 --> 02:04:52,729
I hope people still know what tape is
but I think your listeners will know

6042
02:04:52,729 --> 02:04:52,739
but I think your listeners will know
 

6043
02:04:52,739 --> 02:04:55,609
but I think your listeners will know
what tape is I don't know it's the uh

6044
02:04:55,609 --> 02:04:55,619
what tape is I don't know it's the uh
 

6045
02:04:55,619 --> 02:04:58,550
what tape is I don't know it's the uh
tape Taiwan tell me about this is it

6046
02:04:58,550 --> 02:04:58,560
tape Taiwan tell me about this is it
 

6047
02:04:58,560 --> 02:05:08,470
tape Taiwan tell me about this is it
like a tick tock do can you swipe on it

6048
02:05:08,470 --> 02:05:08,480

 

6049
02:05:08,480 --> 02:05:11,209

he speculated or suggested this

6050
02:05:11,209 --> 02:05:11,219
he speculated or suggested this
 

6051
02:05:11,219 --> 02:05:14,209
he speculated or suggested this
hypothetical experiment whether if life

6052
02:05:14,209 --> 02:05:14,219
hypothetical experiment whether if life
 

6053
02:05:14,219 --> 02:05:17,570
hypothetical experiment whether if life
was recorded on or Can Be Imagined to be

6054
02:05:17,570 --> 02:05:17,580
was recorded on or Can Be Imagined to be
 

6055
02:05:17,580 --> 02:05:20,750
was recorded on or Can Be Imagined to be
recorded on a linear is it linear chain

6056
02:05:20,750 --> 02:05:20,760
recorded on a linear is it linear chain
 

6057
02:05:20,760 --> 02:05:23,330
recorded on a linear is it linear chain
of events recorded on a tape and if we

6058
02:05:23,330 --> 02:05:23,340
of events recorded on a tape and if we
 

6059
02:05:23,340 --> 02:05:25,070
of events recorded on a tape and if we
were to rewind the step would be listen

6060
02:05:25,070 --> 02:05:25,080
were to rewind the step would be listen
 

6061
02:05:25,080 --> 02:05:27,290
were to rewind the step would be listen
to the same song right so this was and

6062
02:05:27,290 --> 02:05:27,300
to the same song right so this was and
 

6063
02:05:27,300 --> 02:05:30,470
to the same song right so this was and
in his proposition I also thought

6064
02:05:30,470 --> 02:05:30,480
in his proposition I also thought
 

6065
02:05:30,480 --> 02:05:33,050
in his proposition I also thought
um yeah but are we replaying the tape in

6066
02:05:33,050 --> 02:05:33,060
um yeah but are we replaying the tape in
 

6067
02:05:33,060 --> 02:05:35,930
um yeah but are we replaying the tape in
the same exact manner or are we meaning

6068
02:05:35,930 --> 02:05:35,940
the same exact manner or are we meaning
 

6069
02:05:35,940 --> 02:05:37,790
the same exact manner or are we meaning
all the geological and environmental

6070
02:05:37,790 --> 02:05:37,800
all the geological and environmental
 

6071
02:05:37,800 --> 02:05:39,290
all the geological and environmental
events are they happening at the same

6072
02:05:39,290 --> 02:05:39,300
events are they happening at the same
 

6073
02:05:39,300 --> 02:05:41,149
events are they happening at the same
time because then you removed the

6074
02:05:41,149 --> 02:05:41,159
time because then you removed the
 

6075
02:05:41,159 --> 02:05:43,250
time because then you removed the
randomness from equation a little bit

6076
02:05:43,250 --> 02:05:43,260
randomness from equation a little bit
 

6077
02:05:43,260 --> 02:05:45,169
randomness from equation a little bit
right you just

6078
02:05:45,169 --> 02:05:45,179
right you just
 

6079
02:05:45,179 --> 02:05:47,149
right you just
removed it because you're assuming

6080
02:05:47,149 --> 02:05:47,159
removed it because you're assuming
 

6081
02:05:47,159 --> 02:05:48,229
removed it because you're assuming
everything will happen at the same time

6082
02:05:48,229 --> 02:05:48,239
everything will happen at the same time
 

6083
02:05:48,239 --> 02:05:49,850
everything will happen at the same time
at the same intensity so that's not two

6084
02:05:49,850 --> 02:05:49,860
at the same intensity so that's not two
 

6085
02:05:49,860 --> 02:05:51,649
at the same intensity so that's not two
contingent

6086
02:05:51,649 --> 02:05:51,659
contingent
 

6087
02:05:51,659 --> 02:05:53,209
contingent
um that means that the natural selection

6088
02:05:53,209 --> 02:05:53,219
um that means that the natural selection
 

6089
02:05:53,219 --> 02:05:54,950
um that means that the natural selection
you're thinking is really operating it

6090
02:05:54,950 --> 02:05:54,960
you're thinking is really operating it
 

6091
02:05:54,960 --> 02:05:57,530
you're thinking is really operating it
more or evolution is operating it more

6092
02:05:57,530 --> 02:05:57,540
more or evolution is operating it more
 

6093
02:05:57,540 --> 02:06:01,010
more or evolution is operating it more
under more random forces then that can

6094
02:06:01,010 --> 02:06:01,020
under more random forces then that can
 

6095
02:06:01,020 --> 02:06:03,950
under more random forces then that can
be dictated by the environment so in our

6096
02:06:03,950 --> 02:06:03,960
be dictated by the environment so in our
 

6097
02:06:03,960 --> 02:06:05,510
be dictated by the environment so in our
way of understanding or thinking about

6098
02:06:05,510 --> 02:06:05,520
way of understanding or thinking about
 

6099
02:06:05,520 --> 02:06:07,070
way of understanding or thinking about
rewinding replaying I don't think we're

6100
02:06:07,070 --> 02:06:07,080
rewinding replaying I don't think we're
 

6101
02:06:07,080 --> 02:06:08,750
rewinding replaying I don't think we're
thinking about the role of the

6102
02:06:08,750 --> 02:06:08,760
thinking about the role of the
 

6103
02:06:08,760 --> 02:06:10,850
thinking about the role of the
environment is clearly or don't seem to

6104
02:06:10,850 --> 02:06:10,860
environment is clearly or don't seem to
 

6105
02:06:10,860 --> 02:06:13,010
environment is clearly or don't seem to
be integrated as much

6106
02:06:13,010 --> 02:06:13,020
be integrated as much
 

6107
02:06:13,020 --> 02:06:15,890
be integrated as much
but I'll I also wonder if it's possible

6108
02:06:15,890 --> 02:06:15,900
but I'll I also wonder if it's possible
 

6109
02:06:15,900 --> 02:06:17,810
but I'll I also wonder if it's possible
that the chemistry ultimately defines

6110
02:06:17,810 --> 02:06:17,820
that the chemistry ultimately defines
 

6111
02:06:17,820 --> 02:06:19,430
that the chemistry ultimately defines
the destination

6112
02:06:19,430 --> 02:06:19,440
the destination
 

6113
02:06:19,440 --> 02:06:21,350
the destination
that uh

6114
02:06:21,350 --> 02:06:21,360
that uh
 

6115
02:06:21,360 --> 02:06:23,510
that uh
despite all the environmental changes

6116
02:06:23,510 --> 02:06:23,520
despite all the environmental changes
 

6117
02:06:23,520 --> 02:06:27,669
despite all the environmental changes
despite all the randomness

6118
02:06:27,669 --> 02:06:27,679
despite all the randomness
 

6119
02:06:27,679 --> 02:06:30,050
despite all the randomness
you're not talking about whether life

6120
02:06:30,050 --> 02:06:30,060
you're not talking about whether life
 

6121
02:06:30,060 --> 02:06:32,209
you're not talking about whether life
will emerge and sustain itself we're

6122
02:06:32,209 --> 02:06:32,219
will emerge and sustain itself we're
 

6123
02:06:32,219 --> 02:06:33,770
will emerge and sustain itself we're
talking about whether life will emerge

6124
02:06:33,770 --> 02:06:33,780
talking about whether life will emerge
 

6125
02:06:33,780 --> 02:06:35,810
talking about whether life will emerge
and sustain itself in the shape and form

6126
02:06:35,810 --> 02:06:35,820
and sustain itself in the shape and form
 

6127
02:06:35,820 --> 02:06:37,550
and sustain itself in the shape and form
that is similar to what we have right

6128
02:06:37,550 --> 02:06:37,560
that is similar to what we have right
 

6129
02:06:37,560 --> 02:06:40,729
that is similar to what we have right
now so you are chemistry on chemistry

6130
02:06:40,729 --> 02:06:40,739
now so you are chemistry on chemistry
 

6131
02:06:40,739 --> 02:06:42,830
now so you are chemistry on chemistry
we're having this conversation and your

6132
02:06:42,830 --> 02:06:42,840
we're having this conversation and your
 

6133
02:06:42,840 --> 02:06:44,390
we're having this conversation and your
plans are chemistry too they are also

6134
02:06:44,390 --> 02:06:44,400
plans are chemistry too they are also
 

6135
02:06:44,400 --> 02:06:46,189
plans are chemistry too they are also
having their own conversation these

6136
02:06:46,189 --> 02:06:46,199
having their own conversation these
 

6137
02:06:46,199 --> 02:06:48,470
having their own conversation these
plants are fake but yes but I still

6138
02:06:48,470 --> 02:06:48,480
plants are fake but yes but I still
 

6139
02:06:48,480 --> 02:06:49,790
plants are fake but yes but I still
didn't want to say that but they they're

6140
02:06:49,790 --> 02:06:49,800
didn't want to say that but they they're
 

6141
02:06:49,800 --> 02:06:52,490
didn't want to say that but they they're
fake do you look at my place of course

6142
02:06:52,490 --> 02:06:52,500
fake do you look at my place of course
 

6143
02:06:52,500 --> 02:06:53,990
fake do you look at my place of course
that would be fake otherwise they would

6144
02:06:53,990 --> 02:06:54,000
that would be fake otherwise they would
 

6145
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,450
that would be fake otherwise they would
die what's wrong with this place it's uh

6146
02:06:56,450 --> 02:06:56,460
die what's wrong with this place it's uh
 

6147
02:06:56,460 --> 02:06:58,609
die what's wrong with this place it's uh
it's wonderful it's

6148
02:06:58,609 --> 02:06:58,619
it's wonderful it's
 

6149
02:06:58,619 --> 02:07:00,050
it's wonderful it's
um we're I'm Alice and this is

6150
02:07:00,050 --> 02:07:00,060
um we're I'm Alice and this is
 

6151
02:07:00,060 --> 02:07:02,689
um we're I'm Alice and this is
Wonderland this this is great this is

6152
02:07:02,689 --> 02:07:02,699
Wonderland this this is great this is
 

6153
02:07:02,699 --> 02:07:04,250
Wonderland this this is great this is
great it's just that you know there's

6154
02:07:04,250 --> 02:07:04,260
great it's just that you know there's
 

6155
02:07:04,260 --> 02:07:06,229
great it's just that you know there's
this is a place where robots flourish

6156
02:07:06,229 --> 02:07:06,239
this is a place where robots flourish
 

6157
02:07:06,239 --> 02:07:09,169
this is a place where robots flourish
and this is that those plants are fake

6158
02:07:09,169 --> 02:07:09,179
and this is that those plants are fake
 

6159
02:07:09,179 --> 02:07:10,790
and this is that those plants are fake
are you saying that you and I are the

6160
02:07:10,790 --> 02:07:10,800
are you saying that you and I are the
 

6161
02:07:10,800 --> 02:07:12,109
are you saying that you and I are the
only living organisms well obviously

6162
02:07:12,109 --> 02:07:12,119
only living organisms well obviously
 

6163
02:07:12,119 --> 02:07:13,850
only living organisms well obviously
there are microbes in this room but yeah

6164
02:07:13,850 --> 02:07:13,860
there are microbes in this room but yeah
 

6165
02:07:13,860 --> 02:07:16,910
there are microbes in this room but yeah
yeah we are the only living organisms a

6166
02:07:16,910 --> 02:07:16,920
yeah we are the only living organisms a
 

6167
02:07:16,920 --> 02:07:18,530
yeah we are the only living organisms a
second of getting a dog well you you

6168
02:07:18,530 --> 02:07:18,540
second of getting a dog well you you
 

6169
02:07:18,540 --> 02:07:20,209
second of getting a dog well you you
know this is not a clean room so you

6170
02:07:20,209 --> 02:07:20,219
know this is not a clean room so you
 

6171
02:07:20,219 --> 02:07:22,490
know this is not a clean room so you
have microbes here yes many millions yes

6172
02:07:22,490 --> 02:07:22,500
have microbes here yes many millions yes
 

6173
02:07:22,500 --> 02:07:24,649
have microbes here yes many millions yes
so so you and I and all the microbes in

6174
02:07:24,649 --> 02:07:24,659
so so you and I and all the microbes in
 

6175
02:07:24,659 --> 02:07:26,689
so so you and I and all the microbes in
this room your chemical systems that are

6176
02:07:26,689 --> 02:07:26,699
this room your chemical systems that are
 

6177
02:07:26,699 --> 02:07:28,490
this room your chemical systems that are
operating it in a way that we can

6178
02:07:28,490 --> 02:07:28,500
operating it in a way that we can
 

6179
02:07:28,500 --> 02:07:30,709
operating it in a way that we can
respond and sense and our environments

6180
02:07:30,709 --> 02:07:30,719
respond and sense and our environments
 

6181
02:07:30,719 --> 02:07:33,350
respond and sense and our environments
and whatnot yeah but in if you are

6182
02:07:33,350 --> 02:07:33,360
and whatnot yeah but in if you are
 

6183
02:07:33,360 --> 02:07:34,669
and whatnot yeah but in if you are
asking if you're going to be here then

6184
02:07:34,669 --> 02:07:34,679
asking if you're going to be here then
 

6185
02:07:34,679 --> 02:07:36,950
asking if you're going to be here then
you're imagining that another solution

6186
02:07:36,950 --> 02:07:36,960
you're imagining that another solution
 

6187
02:07:36,960 --> 02:07:39,550
you're imagining that another solution
is also possible which is different

6188
02:07:39,550 --> 02:07:39,560
is also possible which is different
 

6189
02:07:39,560 --> 02:07:42,290
is also possible which is different
then the fundamentals of life because

6190
02:07:42,290 --> 02:07:42,300
then the fundamentals of life because
 

6191
02:07:42,300 --> 02:07:44,149
then the fundamentals of life because
life will be always life will do its

6192
02:07:44,149 --> 02:07:44,159
life will be always life will do its
 

6193
02:07:44,159 --> 02:07:46,729
life will be always life will do its
life thing

6194
02:07:46,729 --> 02:07:46,739

 

6195
02:07:46,739 --> 02:07:49,430

I guess it goes all the way back to the

6196
02:07:49,430 --> 02:07:49,440
I guess it goes all the way back to the
 

6197
02:07:49,440 --> 02:07:50,870
I guess it goes all the way back to the
things we're talking about translation

6198
02:07:50,870 --> 02:07:50,880
things we're talking about translation
 

6199
02:07:50,880 --> 02:07:53,330
things we're talking about translation
and the stuff you were messing with is

6200
02:07:53,330 --> 02:07:53,340
and the stuff you were messing with is
 

6201
02:07:53,340 --> 02:07:54,890
and the stuff you were messing with is
figuring out what is the important stuff

6202
02:07:54,890 --> 02:07:54,900
figuring out what is the important stuff
 

6203
02:07:54,900 --> 02:07:57,169
figuring out what is the important stuff
and what isn't

6204
02:07:57,169 --> 02:07:57,179
and what isn't
 

6205
02:07:57,179 --> 02:07:59,330
and what isn't
makes you wonder about you know just

6206
02:07:59,330 --> 02:07:59,340
makes you wonder about you know just
 

6207
02:07:59,340 --> 02:08:01,490
makes you wonder about you know just
like with the Trans uh translation

6208
02:08:01,490 --> 02:08:01,500
like with the Trans uh translation
 

6209
02:08:01,500 --> 02:08:03,890
like with the Trans uh translation
machinery

6210
02:08:03,890 --> 02:08:03,900
machinery
 

6211
02:08:03,900 --> 02:08:05,689
machinery
with human beings I wonder what's the

6212
02:08:05,689 --> 02:08:05,699
with human beings I wonder what's the
 

6213
02:08:05,699 --> 02:08:07,010
with human beings I wonder what's the
important stuff is it important to have

6214
02:08:07,010 --> 02:08:07,020
important stuff is it important to have
 

6215
02:08:07,020 --> 02:08:08,570
important stuff is it important to have
two limbs

6216
02:08:08,570 --> 02:08:08,580
two limbs
 

6217
02:08:08,580 --> 02:08:11,089
two limbs
is it important to have eyes like it was

6218
02:08:11,089 --> 02:08:11,099
is it important to have eyes like it was
 

6219
02:08:11,099 --> 02:08:13,189
is it important to have eyes like it was
obvious that the sensory mechanism of

6220
02:08:13,189 --> 02:08:13,199
obvious that the sensory mechanism of
 

6221
02:08:13,199 --> 02:08:16,970
obvious that the sensory mechanism of
eyes like sight were to develop how many

6222
02:08:16,970 --> 02:08:16,980
eyes like sight were to develop how many
 

6223
02:08:16,980 --> 02:08:19,370
eyes like sight were to develop how many
times if you're in Earth would the

6224
02:08:19,370 --> 02:08:19,380
times if you're in Earth would the
 

6225
02:08:19,380 --> 02:08:22,129
times if you're in Earth would the
sensory mechanism of sight develop and

6226
02:08:22,129 --> 02:08:22,139
sensory mechanism of sight develop and
 

6227
02:08:22,139 --> 02:08:23,510
sensory mechanism of sight develop and
what would it look like would it be one

6228
02:08:23,510 --> 02:08:23,520
what would it look like would it be one
 

6229
02:08:23,520 --> 02:08:24,830
what would it look like would it be one
giant eye

6230
02:08:24,830 --> 02:08:24,840
giant eye
 

6231
02:08:24,840 --> 02:08:27,290
giant eye
I would be two what's with a symmetry

6232
02:08:27,290 --> 02:08:27,300
I would be two what's with a symmetry
 

6233
02:08:27,300 --> 02:08:29,750
I would be two what's with a symmetry
why are we so damn symmetrical in

6234
02:08:29,750 --> 02:08:29,760
why are we so damn symmetrical in
 

6235
02:08:29,760 --> 02:08:31,970
why are we so damn symmetrical in

02:08:33,830 --> 02:08:33,840
uh
 

6239
02:08:33,840 --> 02:08:36,709
uh
most people who would who argue that

6240
02:08:36,709 --> 02:08:36,719
most people who would who argue that
 

6241
02:08:36,719 --> 02:08:39,830
most people who would who argue that
life is convergent and it will in fact

6242
02:08:39,830 --> 02:08:39,840
life is convergent and it will in fact
 

6243
02:08:39,840 --> 02:08:44,470
life is convergent and it will in fact
lead to a few determined outcomes or the

6244
02:08:44,470 --> 02:08:44,480
lead to a few determined outcomes or the
 

6245
02:08:44,480 --> 02:08:46,729
lead to a few determined outcomes or the
it's not that the outcome is determined

6246
02:08:46,729 --> 02:08:46,739
it's not that the outcome is determined
 

6247
02:08:46,739 --> 02:08:49,550
it's not that the outcome is determined
per se but uh it's the pathways are

6248
02:08:49,550 --> 02:08:49,560
per se but uh it's the pathways are
 

6249
02:08:49,560 --> 02:08:52,010
per se but uh it's the pathways are
restricted and the mutational

6250
02:08:52,010 --> 02:08:52,020
restricted and the mutational
 

6251
02:08:52,020 --> 02:08:55,010
restricted and the mutational
trajectories that life can act upon uh

6252
02:08:55,010 --> 02:08:55,020
trajectories that life can act upon uh
 

6253
02:08:55,020 --> 02:08:57,649
trajectories that life can act upon uh
are already very limited so that the

6254
02:08:57,649 --> 02:08:57,659
are already very limited so that the
 

6255
02:08:57,659 --> 02:09:00,229
are already very limited so that the
final outcomes are a few

6256
02:09:00,229 --> 02:09:00,239
final outcomes are a few
 

6257
02:09:00,239 --> 02:09:04,490
final outcomes are a few
and eyes being one of them so

6258
02:09:04,490 --> 02:09:04,500

presented as an example of why life may
 

6265
02:09:12,300 --> 02:09:14,330
presented as an example of why life may
actually embark on the same solution

6266
02:09:14,330 --> 02:09:14,340
actually embark on the same solution
 

6267
02:09:14,340 --> 02:09:16,310
actually embark on the same solution
over and over again given that many

6268
02:09:16,310 --> 02:09:16,320
over and over again given that many
 

6269
02:09:16,320 --> 02:09:18,709
over and over again given that many

species evolved it independently from
 

6271
02:09:18,719 --> 02:09:20,089
species evolved it independently from
one another do you think there's any

6272
02:09:20,089 --> 02:09:20,099
one another do you think there's any
 

6273
02:09:20,099 --> 02:09:23,450
one another do you think there's any
inkling of Truth there like uh is it

6274
02:09:23,450 --> 02:09:23,460
inkling of Truth there like uh is it
 

6275
02:09:23,460 --> 02:09:25,850
inkling of Truth there like uh is it
just us humans thinking we're special I

6276
02:09:25,850 --> 02:09:25,860
just us humans thinking we're special I
 

6277
02:09:25,860 --> 02:09:27,649
just us humans thinking we're special I
think the those Innovations came again

6278
02:09:27,649 --> 02:09:27,659
think the those Innovations came again
 

6279
02:09:27,659 --> 02:09:32,350
think the those Innovations came again
so far after the uh

6280
02:09:32,350 --> 02:09:32,360
so far after the uh
 

6281
02:09:32,360 --> 02:09:36,410
so far after the uh
the fun stuff yes uh because it's it's

6282
02:09:36,410 --> 02:09:36,420
the fun stuff yes uh because it's it's
 

6283
02:09:36,420 --> 02:09:38,930
the fun stuff yes uh because it's it's
thank you I mean thank you I think we

6284
02:09:38,930 --> 02:09:38,940
thank you I mean thank you I think we
 

6285
02:09:38,940 --> 02:09:40,430
thank you I mean thank you I think we
humans tend to talk about the later

6286
02:09:40,430 --> 02:09:40,440
humans tend to talk about the later
 

6287
02:09:40,440 --> 02:09:42,770
humans tend to talk about the later
stuff but without the earlier yeah so

6288
02:09:42,770 --> 02:09:42,780
stuff but without the earlier yeah so
 

6289
02:09:42,780 --> 02:09:45,589
stuff but without the earlier yeah so
when we when we think of earlier there's

6290
02:09:45,589 --> 02:09:45,599
when we when we think of earlier there's
 

6291
02:09:45,599 --> 02:09:47,750
when we when we think of earlier there's
and I asked this to my students too I

6292
02:09:47,750 --> 02:09:47,760
and I asked this to my students too I
 

6293
02:09:47,760 --> 02:09:49,669
and I asked this to my students too I
want them to close their eyes and think

6294
02:09:49,669 --> 02:09:49,679
want them to close their eyes and think
 

6295
02:09:49,679 --> 02:09:52,550
want them to close their eyes and think
about just nothingness but dust we don't

6296
02:09:52,550 --> 02:09:52,560
about just nothingness but dust we don't
 

6297
02:09:52,560 --> 02:09:54,530
about just nothingness but dust we don't
have trees we don't have plants when we

6298
02:09:54,530 --> 02:09:54,540
have trees we don't have plants when we
 

6299
02:09:54,540 --> 02:09:57,350
have trees we don't have plants when we
say an empty place or visually at least

6300
02:09:57,350 --> 02:09:57,360
say an empty place or visually at least
 

6301
02:09:57,360 --> 02:09:59,390
say an empty place or visually at least
two we're talking about a planet that is

6302
02:09:59,390 --> 02:09:59,400
two we're talking about a planet that is
 

6303
02:09:59,400 --> 02:10:02,089
two we're talking about a planet that is
really alien so understanding our own

6304
02:10:02,089 --> 02:10:02,099
really alien so understanding our own
 

6305
02:10:02,099 --> 02:10:04,010
really alien so understanding our own
past is similar to understanding an

6306
02:10:04,010 --> 02:10:04,020
past is similar to understanding an
 

6307
02:10:04,020 --> 02:10:06,770
past is similar to understanding an
alien planet altogether given that it is

6308
02:10:06,770 --> 02:10:06,780
alien planet altogether given that it is
 

6309
02:10:06,780 --> 02:10:08,510
alien planet altogether given that it is
a very different planet that did not

6310
02:10:08,510 --> 02:10:08,520
a very different planet that did not
 

6311
02:10:08,520 --> 02:10:11,689
a very different planet that did not
have any Oxygen for 2 billion years we

6312
02:10:11,689 --> 02:10:11,699
have any Oxygen for 2 billion years we
 

6313
02:10:11,699 --> 02:10:13,729
have any Oxygen for 2 billion years we
there's nothing that is familiar to us

6314
02:10:13,729 --> 02:10:13,739
there's nothing that is familiar to us
 

6315
02:10:13,739 --> 02:10:16,669
there's nothing that is familiar to us
that we would even think about with when

6316
02:10:16,669 --> 02:10:16,679
that we would even think about with when
 

6317
02:10:16,679 --> 02:10:19,010
that we would even think about with when
we think about life that is present in

6318
02:10:19,010 --> 02:10:19,020
we think about life that is present in
 

6319
02:10:19,020 --> 02:10:21,830
we think about life that is present in
our past yet here we are so cool that

6320
02:10:21,830 --> 02:10:21,840
our past yet here we are so cool that
 

6321
02:10:21,840 --> 02:10:25,550
our past yet here we are so cool that
from that came this like houses and we

6322
02:10:25,550 --> 02:10:25,560
from that came this like houses and we
 

6323
02:10:25,560 --> 02:10:26,950
from that came this like houses and we
are very very

6324
02:10:26,950 --> 02:10:26,960
are very very
 

6325
02:10:26,960 --> 02:10:29,510
are very very
we are the super late arrivals to the

6326
02:10:29,510 --> 02:10:29,520
we are the super late arrivals to the
 

6327
02:10:29,520 --> 02:10:31,609
we are the super late arrivals to the
party right so this is definitely not

6328
02:10:31,609 --> 02:10:31,619
party right so this is definitely not
 

6329
02:10:31,619 --> 02:10:34,430
party right so this is definitely not
our planets it's the microbial planets

6330
02:10:34,430 --> 02:10:34,440
our planets it's the microbial planets
 

6331
02:10:34,440 --> 02:10:36,169
our planets it's the microbial planets
that we live in but the potential to

6332
02:10:36,169 --> 02:10:36,179
that we live in but the potential to
 

6333
02:10:36,179 --> 02:10:38,209
that we live in but the potential to
create us was always there

6334
02:10:38,209 --> 02:10:38,219
create us was always there
 

6335
02:10:38,219 --> 02:10:40,550
create us was always there
I just know that

6336
02:10:40,550 --> 02:10:40,560
I just know that
 

6337
02:10:40,560 --> 02:10:43,010
I just know that
because we were created

6338
02:10:43,010 --> 02:10:43,020
because we were created
 

6339
02:10:43,020 --> 02:10:44,330
because we were created
oh

6340
02:10:44,330 --> 02:10:44,340
oh
 

6341
02:10:44,340 --> 02:10:47,330
oh
I don't know I what is it you think it's

6342
02:10:47,330 --> 02:10:47,340
I don't know I what is it you think it's
 

6343
02:10:47,340 --> 02:10:50,510
I don't know I what is it you think it's
possible this even for the early stuff

6344
02:10:50,510 --> 02:10:50,520
possible this even for the early stuff
 

6345
02:10:50,520 --> 02:10:52,970
possible this even for the early stuff
yeah maybe if it's super unlikely yeah

6346
02:10:52,970 --> 02:10:52,980
yeah maybe if it's super unlikely yeah
 

6347
02:10:52,980 --> 02:10:55,189
yeah maybe if it's super unlikely yeah
that we just got super oh this is the

6348
02:10:55,189 --> 02:10:55,199
that we just got super oh this is the
 

6349
02:10:55,199 --> 02:10:57,229
that we just got super oh this is the
planet that got really lucky given the

6350
02:10:57,229 --> 02:10:57,239
planet that got really lucky given the
 

6351
02:10:57,239 --> 02:10:58,609
planet that got really lucky given the

6353
02:10:58,619 --> 02:11:01,490

like maybe to create the bacteria is not

6354
02:11:01,490 --> 02:11:01,500
like maybe to create the bacteria is not
 

6355
02:11:01,500 --> 02:11:02,810
like maybe to create the bacteria is not
so lucky

6356
02:11:02,810 --> 02:11:02,820
so lucky
 

6357
02:11:02,820 --> 02:11:05,689
so lucky
but to create complex organisms all the

6358
02:11:05,689 --> 02:11:05,699
but to create complex organisms all the
 

6359
02:11:05,699 --> 02:11:08,089
but to create complex organisms all the
way up to mammals that's super lucky yes

6360
02:11:08,089 --> 02:11:08,099
way up to mammals that's super lucky yes
 

6361
02:11:08,099 --> 02:11:10,070
way up to mammals that's super lucky yes
and it may all come down to a few

6362
02:11:10,070 --> 02:11:10,080
and it may all come down to a few
 

6363
02:11:10,080 --> 02:11:11,810
and it may all come down to a few
innovations that happened at the

6364
02:11:11,810 --> 02:11:11,820
innovations that happened at the
 

6365
02:11:11,820 --> 02:11:14,089
innovations that happened at the
molecular levels

6366
02:11:14,089 --> 02:11:14,099
molecular levels
 

6367
02:11:14,099 --> 02:11:17,510

um that may or may not be inevitable

6368
02:11:17,510 --> 02:11:17,520
um that may or may not be inevitable
 

6369
02:11:17,520 --> 02:11:20,810
um that may or may not be inevitable
that's that so all these molecular

6370
02:11:20,810 --> 02:11:20,820
that's that so all these molecular
 

6371
02:11:20,820 --> 02:11:24,169
that's that so all these molecular
tricks may have enabled the the sort of

um
 

6481
02:13:31,139 --> 02:13:33,589
um
there are really exciting ideas uh maybe

6482
02:13:33,589 --> 02:13:33,599
there are really exciting ideas uh maybe
 

6483
02:13:33,599 --> 02:13:36,350
there are really exciting ideas uh maybe
some boring ones but

6484
02:13:36,350 --> 02:13:36,360
some boring ones but
 

6485
02:13:36,360 --> 02:13:38,930
some boring ones but
um if if you

6486
02:13:38,930 --> 02:13:38,940
um if if you
 

6487
02:13:38,940 --> 02:13:40,850
um if if you
are you really interested in doing

6488
02:13:40,850 --> 02:13:40,860
are you really interested in doing
 

6489
02:13:40,860 --> 02:13:43,129
are you really interested in doing
something different then you need to be

6490
02:13:43,129 --> 02:13:43,139
something different then you need to be
 

6491
02:13:43,139 --> 02:13:45,890
something different then you need to be
willing to take the risk to be wrong

6492
02:13:45,890 --> 02:13:45,900
willing to take the risk to be wrong
 

6493
02:13:45,900 --> 02:13:48,770
willing to take the risk to be wrong
uh and that's incredibly difficult it's

6494
02:13:48,770 --> 02:13:48,780
uh and that's incredibly difficult it's
 

6495
02:13:48,780 --> 02:13:51,589
uh and that's incredibly difficult it's
even though we talked about the idealist

even though we talked about the idealist
 

6497
02:13:51,599 --> 02:13:55,189
even though we talked about the idealist
uh sort of notion behind science that we

6498
02:13:55,189 --> 02:13:55,199
uh sort of notion behind science that we
 

6499
02:13:55,199 --> 02:13:56,870
uh sort of notion behind science that we
ultimately want to be rejected or our

there there is a level of risk-taking I
 

6509
02:14:06,420 --> 02:14:08,510
there there is a level of risk-taking I
think behind

6510
02:14:08,510 --> 02:14:08,520
think behind
 

6511
02:14:08,520 --> 02:14:09,649
think behind
um

6512
02:14:09,649 --> 02:14:09,659
um
 

6513
02:14:09,659 --> 02:14:13,129
um
any creative idea and and I mean that in

6514
02:14:13,129 --> 02:14:13,139
any creative idea and and I mean that in
 

6515
02:14:13,139 --> 02:14:15,709
any creative idea and and I mean that in
a true sense if you are disappointed

6516
02:14:15,709 --> 02:14:15,719
a true sense if you are disappointed
 

6517
02:14:15,719 --> 02:14:17,930
a true sense if you are disappointed
that your idea didn't work

6518
02:14:17,930 --> 02:14:17,940
that your idea didn't work
 

6519
02:14:17,940 --> 02:14:20,990
that your idea didn't work
then it wasn't a risk because you still

6520
02:14:20,990 --> 02:14:21,000
then it wasn't a risk because you still
 

6521
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:23,149
then it wasn't a risk because you still
hoped that it will work

6522
02:14:23,149 --> 02:14:23,159
hoped that it will work
 

6523
02:14:23,159 --> 02:14:25,069
hoped that it will work
through risk is that you accept that it

6524
02:14:25,069 --> 02:14:25,079
through risk is that you accept that it
 

6525
02:14:25,079 --> 02:14:26,870
through risk is that you accept that it
may not work so that the failure

6526
02:14:26,870 --> 02:14:26,880
may not work so that the failure
 

6527
02:14:26,880 --> 02:14:29,149
may not work so that the failure
shouldn't also surprise you

6528
02:14:29,149 --> 02:14:29,159
shouldn't also surprise you
 

6529
02:14:29,159 --> 02:14:30,649
shouldn't also surprise you
yeah

6530
02:14:30,649 --> 02:14:30,659
yeah
 

6531
02:14:30,659 --> 02:14:32,930
yeah
is that when you embark on stuff do you

6532
02:14:32,930 --> 02:14:32,940
is that when you embark on stuff do you
 

6533
02:14:32,940 --> 02:14:35,569
is that when you embark on stuff do you
when you embark on an idea do you

6534
02:14:35,569 --> 02:14:35,579
when you embark on an idea do you
 

6535
02:14:35,579 --> 02:14:37,490
when you embark on an idea do you
actually

6536
02:14:37,490 --> 02:14:37,500
actually
 

6537
02:14:37,500 --> 02:14:41,569
actually
contemplate and accept uh failure like

6538
02:14:41,569 --> 02:14:41,579
contemplate and accept uh failure like
 

6539
02:14:41,579 --> 02:14:45,010
contemplate and accept uh failure like
as a society I wouldn't say so but I

6540
02:14:45,010 --> 02:14:45,020
as a society I wouldn't say so but I
 

6541
02:14:45,020 --> 02:14:48,770
as a society I wouldn't say so but I
eliminated a lot of the things uh

6542
02:14:48,770 --> 02:14:48,780
eliminated a lot of the things uh
 

6543
02:14:48,780 --> 02:14:53,629
eliminated a lot of the things uh
out of my work line by simply

6544
02:14:53,629 --> 02:14:53,639
out of my work line by simply
 

6545
02:14:53,639 --> 02:14:56,450
out of my work line by simply
not feeling like studying them I was

6546
02:14:56,450 --> 02:14:56,460
not feeling like studying them I was
 

6547
02:14:56,460 --> 02:15:00,649
not feeling like studying them I was
bored chasing certain questions and I so

6548
02:15:00,649 --> 02:15:00,659
bored chasing certain questions and I so
 

6549
02:15:00,659 --> 02:15:03,290
bored chasing certain questions and I so
you trusted the signal of boredom as a

6550
02:15:03,290 --> 02:15:03,300
you trusted the signal of boredom as a
 

6551
02:15:03,300 --> 02:15:05,149
you trusted the signal of boredom as a
as a good sign that it's not a good

6552
02:15:05,149 --> 02:15:05,159
as a good sign that it's not a good
 

6553
02:15:05,159 --> 02:15:07,810
as a good sign that it's not a good
question it should definitely

6554
02:15:07,810 --> 02:15:07,820
question it should definitely
 

6555
02:15:07,820 --> 02:15:10,609
question it should definitely
be whatever you're doing should be

6556
02:15:10,609 --> 02:15:10,619
be whatever you're doing should be
 

6557
02:15:10,619 --> 02:15:12,229
be whatever you're doing should be
exciting to you if you're the only if

6558
02:15:12,229 --> 02:15:12,239
exciting to you if you're the only if
 

6559
02:15:12,239 --> 02:15:13,550
exciting to you if you're the only if
there's only one person that should be

6560
02:15:13,550 --> 02:15:13,560
there's only one person that should be
 

6561
02:15:13,560 --> 02:15:14,930
there's only one person that should be
ever excited about what you're doing

6562
02:15:14,930 --> 02:15:14,940
ever excited about what you're doing
 

6563
02:15:14,940 --> 02:15:17,450
ever excited about what you're doing
that should be you yeah and if that's

6564
02:15:17,450 --> 02:15:17,460
that should be you yeah and if that's
 

6565
02:15:17,460 --> 02:15:19,790
that should be you yeah and if that's
enough for for that idea to go somewhere

6566
02:15:19,790 --> 02:15:19,800
enough for for that idea to go somewhere
 

6567
02:15:19,800 --> 02:15:21,950
enough for for that idea to go somewhere
I think that you need to believe in the

6568
02:15:21,950 --> 02:15:21,960
I think that you need to believe in the
 

6569
02:15:21,960 --> 02:15:24,290
I think that you need to believe in the
idea but at the same time I think it's

6570
02:15:24,290 --> 02:15:24,300
idea but at the same time I think it's
 

6571
02:15:24,300 --> 02:15:27,229
idea but at the same time I think it's
important to not fall in love with your

6572
02:15:27,229 --> 02:15:27,239
important to not fall in love with your
 

6573
02:15:27,239 --> 02:15:28,729
important to not fall in love with your
mistakes

6574
02:15:28,729 --> 02:15:28,739
mistakes
 

6575
02:15:28,739 --> 02:15:31,669
mistakes
you know that you if if something isn't

6576
02:15:31,669 --> 02:15:31,679
you know that you if if something isn't
 

6577
02:15:31,679 --> 02:15:32,629
you know that you if if something isn't
working

6578
02:15:32,629 --> 02:15:32,639
working
 

6579
02:15:32,639 --> 02:15:35,270
working
you should let it go

6580
02:15:35,270 --> 02:15:35,280
you should let it go
 

6581
02:15:35,280 --> 02:15:38,030
you should let it go
instead of trying to fix it even though

6582
02:15:38,030 --> 02:15:38,040
instead of trying to fix it even though
 

6583
02:15:38,040 --> 02:15:39,709
instead of trying to fix it even though
you feel that this is a mistake or you

6584
02:15:39,709 --> 02:15:39,719
you feel that this is a mistake or you
 

6585
02:15:39,719 --> 02:15:41,209
you feel that this is a mistake or you
know that it's a mistake

6586
02:15:41,209 --> 02:15:41,219
know that it's a mistake
 

6587
02:15:41,219 --> 02:15:43,330
know that it's a mistake
in order to

6588
02:15:43,330 --> 02:15:43,340
in order to
 

6589
02:15:43,340 --> 02:15:47,229
in order to
sorry instead of trying to fix it

6590
02:15:47,229 --> 02:15:47,239
sorry instead of trying to fix it
 

6591
02:15:47,239 --> 02:15:49,490
sorry instead of trying to fix it
you should

6592
02:15:49,490 --> 02:15:49,500
you should
 

6593
02:15:49,500 --> 02:15:51,589
you should
wrap it up and move on to something else

6594
02:15:51,589 --> 02:15:51,599
wrap it up and move on to something else
 

6595
02:15:51,599 --> 02:15:53,930
wrap it up and move on to something else
which is incredibly hard good advice for

6596
02:15:53,930 --> 02:15:53,940
which is incredibly hard good advice for
 

6597
02:15:53,940 --> 02:15:55,370
which is incredibly hard good advice for
science but also good advice for

6598
02:15:55,370 --> 02:15:55,380
science but also good advice for
 

6599
02:15:55,380 --> 02:15:58,310
science but also good advice for
relationships

6600
02:15:58,310 --> 02:15:58,320

 

6601
02:15:58,320 --> 02:16:00,530

um but okay so like well that's actually

6602
02:16:00,530 --> 02:16:00,540
um but okay so like well that's actually
 

6603
02:16:00,540 --> 02:16:02,030
um but okay so like well that's actually
really hard especially I mean this is

6604
02:16:02,030 --> 02:16:02,040
really hard especially I mean this is
 

6605
02:16:02,040 --> 02:16:05,209
really hard especially I mean this is
like PhD stuff like if you sink in so

6606
02:16:05,209 --> 02:16:05,219
like PhD stuff like if you sink in so
 

6607
02:16:05,219 --> 02:16:07,490
like PhD stuff like if you sink in so
much of your time not even PhD the

6608
02:16:07,490 --> 02:16:07,500
much of your time not even PhD the
 

6609
02:16:07,500 --> 02:16:09,589
much of your time not even PhD the
entire entire Scientific careers it's

6610
02:16:09,589 --> 02:16:09,599
entire entire Scientific careers it's
 

6611
02:16:09,599 --> 02:16:12,169
entire entire Scientific careers it's
really tough to let go yes and there is

6612
02:16:12,169 --> 02:16:12,179
really tough to let go yes and there is
 

6613
02:16:12,179 --> 02:16:16,850
really tough to let go yes and there is
not a lot of room for True freedom

6614
02:16:16,850 --> 02:16:16,860
not a lot of room for True freedom
 

6615
02:16:16,860 --> 02:16:20,089
not a lot of room for True freedom
um maybe at this certain degree so first

6616
02:16:20,089 --> 02:16:20,099
um maybe at this certain degree so first
 

6617
02:16:20,099 --> 02:16:22,669
um maybe at this certain degree so first
you need to be trained right it's not

6618
02:16:22,669 --> 02:16:22,679
you need to be trained right it's not
 

6619
02:16:22,679 --> 02:16:24,890
you need to be trained right it's not
that scientists are just brilliant

6620
02:16:24,890 --> 02:16:24,900
that scientists are just brilliant
 

6621
02:16:24,900 --> 02:16:27,589
that scientists are just brilliant
amazing humans I mean they just know and

6622
02:16:27,589 --> 02:16:27,599
amazing humans I mean they just know and
 

6623
02:16:27,599 --> 02:16:29,510
amazing humans I mean they just know and
learn how they they know how to do

6624
02:16:29,510 --> 02:16:29,520
learn how they they know how to do
 

6625
02:16:29,520 --> 02:16:31,970
learn how they they know how to do
science because they're trained and how

6626
02:16:31,970 --> 02:16:31,980
science because they're trained and how
 

6627
02:16:31,980 --> 02:16:33,589
science because they're trained and how
to do science so that that is important

6628
02:16:33,589 --> 02:16:33,599
to do science so that that is important
 

6629
02:16:33,599 --> 02:16:37,030
to do science so that that is important
because I I as someone who

6630
02:16:37,030 --> 02:16:37,040
because I I as someone who
 

6631
02:16:37,040 --> 02:16:40,389
because I I as someone who
wants to definitely I'm hoping that I'm

6632
02:16:40,389 --> 02:16:40,399
wants to definitely I'm hoping that I'm
 

6633
02:16:40,399 --> 02:16:42,530
wants to definitely I'm hoping that I'm
giving the message that this is for

6634
02:16:42,530 --> 02:16:42,540
giving the message that this is for
 

6635
02:16:42,540 --> 02:16:45,290
giving the message that this is for
everybody that there's this notion of

6636
02:16:45,290 --> 02:16:45,300
everybody that there's this notion of
 

6637
02:16:45,300 --> 02:16:47,030
everybody that there's this notion of
science scientists being super smart

6638
02:16:47,030 --> 02:16:47,040
science scientists being super smart
 

6639
02:16:47,040 --> 02:16:50,570
science scientists being super smart
people that's definitely not true right

6640
02:16:50,570 --> 02:16:50,580
people that's definitely not true right
 

6641
02:16:50,580 --> 02:16:53,690
people that's definitely not true right
it is a method that you learn to solve a

6642
02:16:53,690 --> 02:16:53,700
it is a method that you learn to solve a
 

6643
02:16:53,700 --> 02:16:55,610
it is a method that you learn to solve a
problem that's really what science is

6644
02:16:55,610 --> 02:16:55,620
problem that's really what science is
 

6645
02:16:55,620 --> 02:16:58,969
problem that's really what science is
and some are really good at it uh and

6646
02:16:58,969 --> 02:16:58,979
and some are really good at it uh and
 

6647
02:16:58,979 --> 02:17:00,709
and some are really good at it uh and
they they get better edits under really

6648
02:17:00,709 --> 02:17:00,719
they they get better edits under really
 

6649
02:17:00,719 --> 02:17:03,190
they they get better edits under really
good guidance maybe good mentorship

6650
02:17:03,190 --> 02:17:03,200
good guidance maybe good mentorship
 

6651
02:17:03,200 --> 02:17:05,990
good guidance maybe good mentorship
and ultimately everyone finds their own

6652
02:17:05,990 --> 02:17:06,000
and ultimately everyone finds their own
 

6653
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,570
and ultimately everyone finds their own
style of problem solving and what sort

6654
02:17:08,570 --> 02:17:08,580
style of problem solving and what sort
 

6655
02:17:08,580 --> 02:17:10,190
style of problem solving and what sort
of problems they sold but I have not met

6656
02:17:10,190 --> 02:17:10,200
of problems they sold but I have not met
 

6657
02:17:10,200 --> 02:17:12,830
of problems they sold but I have not met
a scientist that finds their own pursue

6658
02:17:12,830 --> 02:17:12,840
a scientist that finds their own pursue
 

6659
02:17:12,840 --> 02:17:15,830
a scientist that finds their own pursue
boring

6660
02:17:15,830 --> 02:17:15,840

 

6661
02:17:15,840 --> 02:17:17,870

well it can happen but they're not going

6662
02:17:17,870 --> 02:17:17,880
well it can happen but they're not going
 

6663
02:17:17,880 --> 02:17:19,490
well it can happen but they're not going
to be affected just like you said I

6664
02:17:19,490 --> 02:17:19,500
to be affected just like you said I
 

6665
02:17:19,500 --> 02:17:20,450
to be affected just like you said I
think

6666
02:17:20,450 --> 02:17:20,460
think
 

6667
02:17:20,460 --> 02:17:22,490
think
it's kind of interesting because

6668
02:17:22,490 --> 02:17:22,500
it's kind of interesting because
 

6669
02:17:22,500 --> 02:17:24,370
it's kind of interesting because
um in in the age of social media and

6670
02:17:24,370 --> 02:17:24,380
um in in the age of social media and
 

6671
02:17:24,380 --> 02:17:26,709
um in in the age of social media and
attention economies and stuff like that

6672
02:17:26,709 --> 02:17:26,719
attention economies and stuff like that
 

6673
02:17:26,719 --> 02:17:28,910
attention economies and stuff like that
you know I've interacted with a lot of

6674
02:17:28,910 --> 02:17:28,920
you know I've interacted with a lot of
 

6675
02:17:28,920 --> 02:17:31,810
you know I've interacted with a lot of
folks like uh YouTubers and so on

6676
02:17:31,810 --> 02:17:31,820
folks like uh YouTubers and so on
 

6677
02:17:31,820 --> 02:17:34,610
folks like uh YouTubers and so on
I think a lot of their work is driven by

6678
02:17:34,610 --> 02:17:34,620
I think a lot of their work is driven by
 

6679
02:17:34,620 --> 02:17:37,129
I think a lot of their work is driven by
what others find exciting

6680
02:17:37,129 --> 02:17:37,139
what others find exciting
 

6681
02:17:37,139 --> 02:17:40,190
what others find exciting
and I think that ultimately leads to A

6682
02:17:40,190 --> 02:17:40,200
and I think that ultimately leads to A
 

6683
02:17:40,200 --> 02:17:42,889
and I think that ultimately leads to A
Life That's not fulfilling I can see the

6684
02:17:42,889 --> 02:17:42,899
Life That's not fulfilling I can see the
 

6685
02:17:42,899 --> 02:17:46,310
Life That's not fulfilling I can see the
reason behind it or perhaps there's a

6686
02:17:46,310 --> 02:17:46,320
reason behind it or perhaps there's a
 

6687
02:17:46,320 --> 02:17:49,429
reason behind it or perhaps there's a
again failure a fear of failure that can

6688
02:17:49,429 --> 02:17:49,439
again failure a fear of failure that can
 

6689
02:17:49,439 --> 02:17:53,209
again failure a fear of failure that can
be a major determinant of that pattern

6690
02:17:53,209 --> 02:17:53,219
be a major determinant of that pattern
 

6691
02:17:53,219 --> 02:17:57,169
be a major determinant of that pattern
right so you try to do something that is

6692
02:17:57,169 --> 02:17:57,179
right so you try to do something that is
 

6693
02:17:57,179 --> 02:17:58,610
right so you try to do something that is
accepted by others because that's maybe

6694
02:17:58,610 --> 02:17:58,620
accepted by others because that's maybe
 

6695
02:17:58,620 --> 02:18:00,650
accepted by others because that's maybe
unlikely to

6696
02:18:00,650 --> 02:18:00,660
unlikely to
 

6697
02:18:00,660 --> 02:18:04,250
unlikely to
um give results right away but it's a

6698
02:18:04,250 --> 02:18:04,260
um give results right away but it's a
 

6699
02:18:04,260 --> 02:18:06,589
um give results right away but it's a
long game it's a very long game and if

6700
02:18:06,589 --> 02:18:06,599
long game it's a very long game and if
 

6701
02:18:06,599 --> 02:18:09,169
long game it's a very long game and if
you're aiming a long-term change in

6702
02:18:09,169 --> 02:18:09,179
you're aiming a long-term change in
 

6703
02:18:09,179 --> 02:18:11,629
you're aiming a long-term change in
long-term impact you're going to be very

6704
02:18:11,629 --> 02:18:11,639
long-term impact you're going to be very
 

6705
02:18:11,639 --> 02:18:14,629
long-term impact you're going to be very
very patient about it and you better

6706
02:18:14,629 --> 02:18:14,639
very patient about it and you better
 

6707
02:18:14,639 --> 02:18:15,290
very patient about it and you better
um

6708
02:18:15,290 --> 02:18:15,300
um
 

6709
02:18:15,300 --> 02:18:17,990
um
tame your ego

6710
02:18:17,990 --> 02:18:18,000
tame your ego
 

6711
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,629
tame your ego
I mean on YouTube and those kinds of

6712
02:18:20,629 --> 02:18:20,639
I mean on YouTube and those kinds of
 

6713
02:18:20,639 --> 02:18:22,969
I mean on YouTube and those kinds of
places on the internet on social media

6714
02:18:22,969 --> 02:18:22,979
places on the internet on social media
 

6715
02:18:22,979 --> 02:18:24,889
places on the internet on social media
you get feedback

6716
02:18:24,889 --> 02:18:24,899
you get feedback
 

6717
02:18:24,899 --> 02:18:28,190
you get feedback
like right away and so it's even harder

6718
02:18:28,190 --> 02:18:28,200
like right away and so it's even harder
 

6719
02:18:28,200 --> 02:18:32,030
like right away and so it's even harder
to be patient yes so in because yeah the

6720
02:18:32,030 --> 02:18:32,040
to be patient yes so in because yeah the
 

6721
02:18:32,040 --> 02:18:34,910
to be patient yes so in because yeah the
change in ideas develop over a period of

6722
02:18:34,910 --> 02:18:34,920
change in ideas develop over a period of
 

6723
02:18:34,920 --> 02:18:38,509
change in ideas develop over a period of
months and years if not decades and the

6724
02:18:38,509 --> 02:18:38,519
months and years if not decades and the
 

6725
02:18:38,519 --> 02:18:40,669
months and years if not decades and the
response from social media and so on is

6726
02:18:40,669 --> 02:18:40,679
response from social media and so on is
 

6727
02:18:40,679 --> 02:18:42,889
response from social media and so on is
on the rate of seconds and minutes and

6728
02:18:42,889 --> 02:18:42,899
on the rate of seconds and minutes and
 

6729
02:18:42,899 --> 02:18:45,410
on the rate of seconds and minutes and
hours so I recommend actual physical

6730
02:18:45,410 --> 02:18:45,420
hours so I recommend actual physical
 

6731
02:18:45,420 --> 02:18:48,490
hours so I recommend actual physical
libraries for people who may want to

6732
02:18:48,490 --> 02:18:48,500
libraries for people who may want to
 

6733
02:18:48,500 --> 02:18:51,950
libraries for people who may want to
appreciate or remember the sense of time

6734
02:18:51,950 --> 02:18:51,960
appreciate or remember the sense of time
 

6735
02:18:51,960 --> 02:18:55,129
appreciate or remember the sense of time
and and how long it takes to build

6736
02:18:55,129 --> 02:18:55,139
and and how long it takes to build
 

6737
02:18:55,139 --> 02:18:57,530
and and how long it takes to build
something I think it is

6738
02:18:57,530 --> 02:18:57,540
something I think it is
 

6739
02:18:57,540 --> 02:19:00,169
something I think it is
um you're right that's the immediacy and

6740
02:19:00,169 --> 02:19:00,179
um you're right that's the immediacy and
 

6741
02:19:00,179 --> 02:19:02,570
um you're right that's the immediacy and
the right response of and and the fact

6742
02:19:02,570 --> 02:19:02,580
the right response of and and the fact
 

6743
02:19:02,580 --> 02:19:04,610
the right response of and and the fact
that the these

6744
02:19:04,610 --> 02:19:04,620
that the these
 

6745
02:19:04,620 --> 02:19:07,129
that the these
places I've algorithm wants you to

6746
02:19:07,129 --> 02:19:07,139
places I've algorithm wants you to
 

6747
02:19:07,139 --> 02:19:09,290
places I've algorithm wants you to
respond right away and interact with

6748
02:19:09,290 --> 02:19:09,300
respond right away and interact with
 

6749
02:19:09,300 --> 02:19:11,330
respond right away and interact with
itself right so

6750
02:19:11,330 --> 02:19:11,340
itself right so
 

6751
02:19:11,340 --> 02:19:14,270
itself right so
um I can see the appeal but through

6752
02:19:14,270 --> 02:19:14,280
um I can see the appeal but through
 

6753
02:19:14,280 --> 02:19:15,830
um I can see the appeal but through
Innovation I think it doesn't even

6754
02:19:15,830 --> 02:19:15,840
Innovation I think it doesn't even
 

6755
02:19:15,840 --> 02:19:18,650
Innovation I think it doesn't even
scream it doesn't it's not shiny

6756
02:19:18,650 --> 02:19:18,660
scream it doesn't it's not shiny
 

6757
02:19:18,660 --> 02:19:20,709
scream it doesn't it's not shiny
especially in the beginning

6758
02:19:20,709 --> 02:19:20,719
especially in the beginning
 

6759
02:19:20,719 --> 02:19:23,150
especially in the beginning
but it's also important to not fool

6760
02:19:23,150 --> 02:19:23,160
but it's also important to not fool
 

6761
02:19:23,160 --> 02:19:24,530
but it's also important to not fool
ourselves and think that everything that

6762
02:19:24,530 --> 02:19:24,540
ourselves and think that everything that
 

6763
02:19:24,540 --> 02:19:26,750
ourselves and think that everything that
people criticize has some super

6764
02:19:26,750 --> 02:19:26,760
people criticize has some super
 

6765
02:19:26,760 --> 02:19:29,030
people criticize has some super
important meaning behind it

6766
02:19:29,030 --> 02:19:29,040
important meaning behind it
 

6767
02:19:29,040 --> 02:19:31,549
important meaning behind it
so it's a mix of the technique the

6768
02:19:31,549 --> 02:19:31,559
so it's a mix of the technique the
 

6769
02:19:31,559 --> 02:19:35,270
so it's a mix of the technique the
methods and your gut feeling

6770
02:19:35,270 --> 02:19:35,280
methods and your gut feeling
 

6771
02:19:35,280 --> 02:19:38,570
methods and your gut feeling
yeah and a weird dance between learning

6772
02:19:38,570 --> 02:19:38,580
yeah and a weird dance between learning
 

6773
02:19:38,580 --> 02:19:42,169
yeah and a weird dance between learning
and accepting the the ideas of the

6774
02:19:42,169 --> 02:19:42,179
and accepting the the ideas of the
 

6775
02:19:42,179 --> 02:19:44,889
and accepting the the ideas of the
current science and

6776
02:19:44,889 --> 02:19:44,899
current science and
 

6777
02:19:44,899 --> 02:19:48,469
current science and
at times trusting your gut and rejecting

6778
02:19:48,469 --> 02:19:48,479
at times trusting your gut and rejecting
 

6779
02:19:48,479 --> 02:19:51,469
at times trusting your gut and rejecting
those because science progresses by

6780
02:19:51,469 --> 02:19:51,479
those because science progresses by
 

6781
02:19:51,479 --> 02:19:53,450
those because science progresses by
sometimes rejecting the ideas of the

6782
02:19:53,450 --> 02:19:53,460
sometimes rejecting the ideas of the
 

6783
02:19:53,460 --> 02:19:55,550
sometimes rejecting the ideas of the
past or sometimes building on them in a

6784
02:19:55,550 --> 02:19:55,560
past or sometimes building on them in a
 

6785
02:19:55,560 --> 02:19:57,170
past or sometimes building on them in a
way that changes them transforms them

6786
02:19:57,170 --> 02:19:57,180
way that changes them transforms them
 

6787
02:19:57,180 --> 02:20:00,170
way that changes them transforms them
yes and and I think what is hard is to

6788
02:20:00,170 --> 02:20:00,180
yes and and I think what is hard is to
 

6789
02:20:00,180 --> 02:20:03,830
yes and and I think what is hard is to
really drill down

6790
02:20:03,830 --> 02:20:03,840
really drill down
 

6791
02:20:03,840 --> 02:20:06,830
really drill down
to a concept right so you can create a a

6792
02:20:06,830 --> 02:20:06,840
to a concept right so you can create a a
 

6793
02:20:06,840 --> 02:20:09,710
to a concept right so you can create a a
new thing and then it may be appealing

6794
02:20:09,710 --> 02:20:09,720
new thing and then it may be appealing
 

6795
02:20:09,720 --> 02:20:12,590
new thing and then it may be appealing
and get a lot of gain a lot of traction

6796
02:20:12,590 --> 02:20:12,600
and get a lot of gain a lot of traction
 

6797
02:20:12,600 --> 02:20:15,710
and get a lot of gain a lot of traction
but to sustain that to continue that you

6798
02:20:15,710 --> 02:20:15,720
but to sustain that to continue that you
 

6799
02:20:15,720 --> 02:20:17,290
but to sustain that to continue that you
really need to show the true expertise

6800
02:20:17,290 --> 02:20:17,300
really need to show the true expertise
 

6801
02:20:17,300 --> 02:20:19,790
really need to show the true expertise
so it's not only about defining a

6802
02:20:19,790 --> 02:20:19,800
so it's not only about defining a
 

6803
02:20:19,800 --> 02:20:22,250
so it's not only about defining a
problem but then really systematically

6804
02:20:22,250 --> 02:20:22,260
problem but then really systematically
 

6805
02:20:22,260 --> 02:20:23,810
problem but then really systematically
solve that problem

6806
02:20:23,810 --> 02:20:23,820
solve that problem
 

6807
02:20:23,820 --> 02:20:28,490
solve that problem
I'll do maybe over the course of decades

6808
02:20:28,490 --> 02:20:28,500
I'll do maybe over the course of decades
 

6809
02:20:28,500 --> 02:20:31,370
I'll do maybe over the course of decades
you mentioned the library I've also saw

6810
02:20:31,370 --> 02:20:31,380
you mentioned the library I've also saw
 

6811
02:20:31,380 --> 02:20:32,810
you mentioned the library I've also saw
that you've translated scientific

6812
02:20:32,810 --> 02:20:32,820
that you've translated scientific
 

6813
02:20:32,820 --> 02:20:34,370
that you've translated scientific
documents or at least like mentioned

6814
02:20:34,370 --> 02:20:34,380
documents or at least like mentioned
 

6815
02:20:34,380 --> 02:20:36,770
documents or at least like mentioned
that you did it at some point in your

6816
02:20:36,770 --> 02:20:36,780
that you did it at some point in your
 

6817
02:20:36,780 --> 02:20:38,210
that you did it at some point in your
life

6818
02:20:38,210 --> 02:20:38,220
life
 

6819
02:20:38,220 --> 02:20:38,929
life
um

6820
02:20:38,929 --> 02:20:38,939
um
 

6821
02:20:38,939 --> 02:20:41,030
um
so let me ask you how much do you think

6822
02:20:41,030 --> 02:20:41,040
so let me ask you how much do you think
 

6823
02:20:41,040 --> 02:20:42,830
so let me ask you how much do you think
is Lost in Translation

6824
02:20:42,830 --> 02:20:42,840
is Lost in Translation
 

6825
02:20:42,840 --> 02:20:46,309
is Lost in Translation
in science and in life

6826
02:20:46,309 --> 02:20:46,319
in science and in life
 

6827
02:20:46,319 --> 02:20:49,550
in science and in life
how many languages do you speak two two

6828
02:20:49,550 --> 02:20:49,560
how many languages do you speak two two
 

6829
02:20:49,560 --> 02:20:51,889
how many languages do you speak two two
how much is lost

6830
02:20:51,889 --> 02:20:51,899
how much is lost
 

6831
02:20:51,899 --> 02:20:54,889
how much is lost
in Translation in in science and in life

6832
02:20:54,889 --> 02:20:54,899
in Translation in in science and in life
 

6833
02:20:54,899 --> 02:20:56,330
in Translation in in science and in life
between those two it's actually three

6834
02:20:56,330 --> 02:20:56,340
between those two it's actually three
 

6835
02:20:56,340 --> 02:20:57,710
between those two it's actually three
because science isn't like another

6836
02:20:57,710 --> 02:20:57,720
because science isn't like another
 

6837
02:20:57,720 --> 02:21:01,070
because science isn't like another
language right it is I speak Russian a

6838
02:21:01,070 --> 02:21:01,080
language right it is I speak Russian a
 

6839
02:21:01,080 --> 02:21:02,870
language right it is I speak Russian a
little bit of French and it's always

6840
02:21:02,870 --> 02:21:02,880
little bit of French and it's always
 

6841
02:21:02,880 --> 02:21:04,849
little bit of French and it's always
fascinating to see how much is lost and

6842
02:21:04,849 --> 02:21:04,859
fascinating to see how much is lost and
 

6843
02:21:04,859 --> 02:21:07,070
fascinating to see how much is lost and
the Soviet Union has a tradition of

6844
02:21:07,070 --> 02:21:07,080
the Soviet Union has a tradition of
 

6845
02:21:07,080 --> 02:21:09,469
the Soviet Union has a tradition of
Science and Mathematics and so on and

6846
02:21:09,469 --> 02:21:09,479
Science and Mathematics and so on and
 

6847
02:21:09,479 --> 02:21:11,750
Science and Mathematics and so on and
it's interesting that a lot of the

6848
02:21:11,750 --> 02:21:11,760
it's interesting that a lot of the
 

6849
02:21:11,760 --> 02:21:13,610
it's interesting that a lot of the
wisdom gained from

6850
02:21:13,610 --> 02:21:13,620
wisdom gained from
 

6851
02:21:13,620 --> 02:21:17,389
wisdom gained from
that part of the world is lost basically

6852
02:21:17,389 --> 02:21:17,399
that part of the world is lost basically
 

6853
02:21:17,399 --> 02:21:23,750
that part of the world is lost basically
because of it was never translated

6854
02:21:23,750 --> 02:21:23,760

 

6855
02:21:23,760 --> 02:21:25,210

per se

6856
02:21:25,210 --> 02:21:25,220
per se
 

6857
02:21:25,220 --> 02:21:28,070
per se
maybe it's more like a gain in some

6858
02:21:28,070 --> 02:21:28,080
maybe it's more like a gain in some
 

6859
02:21:28,080 --> 02:21:31,969
maybe it's more like a gain in some
sense right because you understand and

6860
02:21:31,969 --> 02:21:31,979
sense right because you understand and
 

6861
02:21:31,979 --> 02:21:35,690
sense right because you understand and
science is ultimately a human pursue so

6862
02:21:35,690 --> 02:21:35,700
science is ultimately a human pursue so
 

6863
02:21:35,700 --> 02:21:37,929
science is ultimately a human pursue so
you cannot separate

6864
02:21:37,929 --> 02:21:37,939
you cannot separate
 

6865
02:21:37,939 --> 02:21:41,090
you cannot separate
as much as maybe it's the best

6866
02:21:41,090 --> 02:21:41,100
as much as maybe it's the best
 

6867
02:21:41,100 --> 02:21:43,750
as much as maybe it's the best
system that humans ever came up with

6868
02:21:43,750 --> 02:21:43,760
system that humans ever came up with
 

6869
02:21:43,760 --> 02:21:46,490
system that humans ever came up with
to seek knowledge to generate and make

6870
02:21:46,490 --> 02:21:46,500
to seek knowledge to generate and make
 

6871
02:21:46,500 --> 02:21:48,130
to seek knowledge to generate and make
sense of the world

6872
02:21:48,130 --> 02:21:48,140
sense of the world
 

6873
02:21:48,140 --> 02:21:50,870
sense of the world
it works most of the time it doesn't

6874
02:21:50,870 --> 02:21:50,880
it works most of the time it doesn't
 

6875
02:21:50,880 --> 02:21:52,490
it works most of the time it doesn't
mean it's perfect

6876
02:21:52,490 --> 02:21:52,500
mean it's perfect
 

6877
02:21:52,500 --> 02:21:54,349
mean it's perfect
did the kind of translation do by the

6878
02:21:54,349 --> 02:21:54,359
did the kind of translation do by the
 

6879
02:21:54,359 --> 02:21:57,170
did the kind of translation do by the
way was for scientific work I directly

6880
02:21:57,170 --> 02:21:57,180
way was for scientific work I directly
 

6881
02:21:57,180 --> 02:21:59,870
way was for scientific work I directly
translated for scientific work yes I

6882
02:21:59,870 --> 02:21:59,880
translated for scientific work yes I
 

6883
02:21:59,880 --> 02:22:01,670
translated for scientific work yes I
think that

6884
02:22:01,670 --> 02:22:01,680
think that
 

6885
02:22:01,680 --> 02:22:04,429
think that
um again we

6886
02:22:04,429 --> 02:22:04,439
um again we
 

6887
02:22:04,439 --> 02:22:06,889
um again we
brains are equally distributed but not

6888
02:22:06,889 --> 02:22:06,899
brains are equally distributed but not
 

6889
02:22:06,899 --> 02:22:10,610
brains are equally distributed but not
opportunities are not right so if you

6890
02:22:10,610 --> 02:22:10,620
opportunities are not right so if you
 

6891
02:22:10,620 --> 02:22:11,690
opportunities are not right so if you
um

6892
02:22:11,690 --> 02:22:11,700
um
 

6893
02:22:11,700 --> 02:22:14,389
um
want to include if you want to benefit

6894
02:22:14,389 --> 02:22:14,399
want to include if you want to benefit
 

6895
02:22:14,399 --> 02:22:17,090
want to include if you want to benefit
from all human power whatever we can

6896
02:22:17,090 --> 02:22:17,100
from all human power whatever we can
 

6897
02:22:17,100 --> 02:22:18,650
from all human power whatever we can
generate as human beings you need to

6898
02:22:18,650 --> 02:22:18,660
generate as human beings you need to
 

6899
02:22:18,660 --> 02:22:21,230
generate as human beings you need to
include everybody on the table and that

6900
02:22:21,230 --> 02:22:21,240
include everybody on the table and that
 

6901
02:22:21,240 --> 02:22:24,290
include everybody on the table and that
is by extending the opportunity is I

6902
02:22:24,290 --> 02:22:24,300
is by extending the opportunity is I
 

6903
02:22:24,300 --> 02:22:26,690
is by extending the opportunity is I
think most of us that make it

6904
02:22:26,690 --> 02:22:26,700
think most of us that make it
 

6905
02:22:26,700 --> 02:22:29,030
think most of us that make it
tend to think that we did because of

6906
02:22:29,030 --> 02:22:29,040
tend to think that we did because of
 

6907
02:22:29,040 --> 02:22:30,950
tend to think that we did because of
something special about ourselves and

6908
02:22:30,950 --> 02:22:30,960
something special about ourselves and
 

6909
02:22:30,960 --> 02:22:34,070
something special about ourselves and
but it is important to know that no we

6910
02:22:34,070 --> 02:22:34,080
but it is important to know that no we
 

6911
02:22:34,080 --> 02:22:36,170
but it is important to know that no we
were given opportunities and that's why

6912
02:22:36,170 --> 02:22:36,180
were given opportunities and that's why
 

6913
02:22:36,180 --> 02:22:38,349
were given opportunities and that's why
we are here not because

6914
02:22:38,349 --> 02:22:38,359
we are here not because
 

6915
02:22:38,359 --> 02:22:40,490
we are here not because
there was something inherently special

6916
02:22:40,490 --> 02:22:40,500
there was something inherently special
 

6917
02:22:40,500 --> 02:22:42,410
there was something inherently special
about us or

6918
02:22:42,410 --> 02:22:42,420
about us or
 

6919
02:22:42,420 --> 02:22:45,170
about us or
um or that the system truly selects for

6920
02:22:45,170 --> 02:22:45,180
um or that the system truly selects for
 

6921
02:22:45,180 --> 02:22:47,690
um or that the system truly selects for
the ones that really are yeah and

6922
02:22:47,690 --> 02:22:47,700
the ones that really are yeah and
 

6923
02:22:47,700 --> 02:22:49,130
the ones that really are yeah and
language is a part of the opportunity

6924
02:22:49,130 --> 02:22:49,140
language is a part of the opportunity
 

6925
02:22:49,140 --> 02:22:50,929
language is a part of the opportunity
yeah language is on the fortunate

6926
02:22:50,929 --> 02:22:50,939
yeah language is on the fortunate
 

6927
02:22:50,939 --> 02:22:53,630
yeah language is on the fortunate
because comes with similar to bacteria

6928
02:22:53,630 --> 02:22:53,640
because comes with similar to bacteria
 

6929
02:22:53,640 --> 02:22:55,309
because comes with similar to bacteria
right they they speak these languages

6930
02:22:55,309 --> 02:22:55,319
right they they speak these languages
 

6931
02:22:55,319 --> 02:22:58,130
right they they speak these languages
they they have even we call this we call

6932
02:22:58,130 --> 02:22:58,140
they they have even we call this we call
 

6933
02:22:58,140 --> 02:23:00,469
they they have even we call this we call
culturing the bacteria we call it

6934
02:23:00,469 --> 02:23:00,479
culturing the bacteria we call it
 

6935
02:23:00,479 --> 02:23:02,570
culturing the bacteria we call it
culturing right when we grow bacteria

6936
02:23:02,570 --> 02:23:02,580
culturing right when we grow bacteria
 

6937
02:23:02,580 --> 02:23:04,490
culturing right when we grow bacteria
that we isolate from the environment in

6938
02:23:04,490 --> 02:23:04,500
that we isolate from the environment in
 

6939
02:23:04,500 --> 02:23:06,590
that we isolate from the environment in
the lab meaning that you create an

6940
02:23:06,590 --> 02:23:06,600
the lab meaning that you create an
 

6941
02:23:06,600 --> 02:23:08,510
the lab meaning that you create an
environment for them to grow and Thrive

6942
02:23:08,510 --> 02:23:08,520
environment for them to grow and Thrive
 

6943
02:23:08,520 --> 02:23:11,210
environment for them to grow and Thrive
and sustain themselves that's what we

6944
02:23:11,210 --> 02:23:11,220
and sustain themselves that's what we
 

6945
02:23:11,220 --> 02:23:15,410
and sustain themselves that's what we
say but cultures for microbiologists for

6946
02:23:15,410 --> 02:23:15,420
say but cultures for microbiologists for
 

6947
02:23:15,420 --> 02:23:17,750
say but cultures for microbiologists for
language with language comes a different

6948
02:23:17,750 --> 02:23:17,760
language with language comes a different
 

6949
02:23:17,760 --> 02:23:20,330
language with language comes a different
culture a different perspective

6950
02:23:20,330 --> 02:23:20,340
culture a different perspective
 

6951
02:23:20,340 --> 02:23:22,730
culture a different perspective
um and and you bring that to

6952
02:23:22,730 --> 02:23:22,740
um and and you bring that to
 

6953
02:23:22,740 --> 02:23:26,090
um and and you bring that to
the table I mean it brings the sense of

6954
02:23:26,090 --> 02:23:26,100
the table I mean it brings the sense of
 

6955
02:23:26,100 --> 02:23:29,090
the table I mean it brings the sense of
diversity that can only be achieved by

6956
02:23:29,090 --> 02:23:29,100
diversity that can only be achieved by
 

6957
02:23:29,100 --> 02:23:31,490
diversity that can only be achieved by
clashing perhaps two different cultures

6958
02:23:31,490 --> 02:23:31,500
clashing perhaps two different cultures
 

6959
02:23:31,500 --> 02:23:33,110
clashing perhaps two different cultures
two different languages two different

6960
02:23:33,110 --> 02:23:33,120
two different languages two different
 

6961
02:23:33,120 --> 02:23:34,910
two different languages two different
approaches maybe in some cases four

6962
02:23:34,910 --> 02:23:34,920
approaches maybe in some cases four
 

6963
02:23:34,920 --> 02:23:36,710
approaches maybe in some cases four
different approaches

6964
02:23:36,710 --> 02:23:36,720
different approaches
 

6965
02:23:36,720 --> 02:23:39,530
different approaches
yeah I think language is not just a

6966
02:23:39,530 --> 02:23:39,540
yeah I think language is not just a
 

6967
02:23:39,540 --> 02:23:42,530
yeah I think language is not just a
mechanism of communication it's a way to

6968
02:23:42,530 --> 02:23:42,540
mechanism of communication it's a way to
 

6969
02:23:42,540 --> 02:23:46,190
mechanism of communication it's a way to
um it's a dynamic system of exploring

6970
02:23:46,190 --> 02:23:46,200
um it's a dynamic system of exploring
 

6971
02:23:46,200 --> 02:23:48,349
um it's a dynamic system of exploring
ideas and it's interesting to see that

6972
02:23:48,349 --> 02:23:48,359
ideas and it's interesting to see that
 

6973
02:23:48,359 --> 02:23:49,730
ideas and it's interesting to see that
different languages explores ideas

6974
02:23:49,730 --> 02:23:49,740
different languages explores ideas
 

6975
02:23:49,740 --> 02:23:52,670
different languages explores ideas
differently yes and I think that so when

6976
02:23:52,670 --> 02:23:52,680
differently yes and I think that so when
 

6977
02:23:52,680 --> 02:23:55,070
differently yes and I think that so when
I said science is like a language itself

6978
02:23:55,070 --> 02:23:55,080
I said science is like a language itself
 

6979
02:23:55,080 --> 02:23:57,110
I said science is like a language itself
I said it in two different ways one is

6980
02:23:57,110 --> 02:23:57,120
I said it in two different ways one is
 

6981
02:23:57,120 --> 02:24:00,530
I said it in two different ways one is
very very literal meaning that you can

6982
02:24:00,530 --> 02:24:00,540
very very literal meaning that you can
 

6983
02:24:00,540 --> 02:24:02,330
very very literal meaning that you can
speak English but you that doesn't mean

6984
02:24:02,330 --> 02:24:02,340
speak English but you that doesn't mean

you will understand the scientific paper

you will understand the scientific paper
 

6987
02:24:03,800 --> 02:24:05,990
you will understand the scientific paper
uh that it's a different level of

uh that it's a different level of
 

6989

uh that it's a different level of
English that you need to learn to

6990
02:24:07,370 --> 02:24:07,380
English that you need to learn to
 

6991
02:24:07,380 --> 02:24:10,070

read an evolutionary biology paper

6998
02:24:17,870 --> 02:24:17,880
read an evolutionary biology paper
 

6999
02:24:17,880 --> 02:24:21,050
read an evolutionary biology paper
and vice versa it may sound extremely

7000
02:24:21,050 --> 02:24:21,060
and vice versa it may sound extremely

altogether but there's also the language
 

7005
02:24:24,780 --> 02:24:27,230
altogether but there's also the language
of communicating and because words

of communicating and because words
 

7007

just learning English as a second

7012
02:24:33,710 --> 02:24:33,720
just learning English as a second
 

7013
02:24:33,720 --> 02:24:35,270
just learning English as a second
language alone it's not going to make

7014
02:24:35,270 --> 02:24:35,280
language alone it's not going to make
 

7015
02:24:35,280 --> 02:24:37,550
language alone it's not going to make
you fluent in science either

7016
02:24:37,550 --> 02:24:37,560
you fluent in science either

and it's interesting because
 

7019
02:24:39,420 --> 02:24:41,570

in that sense you speak many more than
 

7021
02:24:41,580 --> 02:24:43,550
in that sense you speak many more than
three languages because uh you're pretty

02:24:43,550 --> 02:24:43,560
three languages because uh you're pretty
 

7023

uh if it's not a fruit salad so a
 

7055
02:25:23,580 --> 02:25:26,150
uh if it's not a fruit salad so a
smoothie is a successful

smoothie is a successful
 

7057
02:25:26,160 --> 02:25:28,670

wouldn't say it's success is necessarily

7062
02:25:32,330 --> 02:25:32,340
wouldn't say it's success is necessarily

02:25:32,340 --> 02:25:35,330
wouldn't say it's success is necessarily
it's some if you put it if you put the

02:25:35,330 --> 02:25:35,340
it's some if you put it if you put the
 

7065
02:25:35,340 --> 02:25:36,830
it's some if you put it if you put the
wrong ingredients and you press the

02:25:36,830 --> 02:25:36,840
wrong ingredients and you press the
 

7067
02:25:36,840 --> 02:25:39,050
wrong ingredients and you press the
blender and you made it a smoothie you

7068
02:25:39,050 --> 02:25:39,060
blender and you made it a smoothie you
 

7069
02:25:39,060 --> 02:25:42,110
blender and you made it a smoothie you
mean it can ruin the entire place can it

7070
02:25:42,110 --> 02:25:42,120
mean it can ruin the entire place can it
 

7071
02:25:42,120 --> 02:25:44,090
mean it can ruin the entire place can it
though because I feel like yes I can

7072
02:25:44,090 --> 02:25:44,100
though because I feel like yes I can
 

7073
02:25:44,100 --> 02:25:45,650
though because I feel like yes I can
definitely assess that for ginger first

7074
02:25:45,650 --> 02:25:45,660
definitely assess that for ginger first
 

7075
02:25:45,660 --> 02:25:47,389
definitely assess that for ginger first
those that ruins every smoothie I don't

7076
02:25:47,389 --> 02:25:47,399
those that ruins every smoothie I don't
 

7077
02:25:47,399 --> 02:25:49,610
those that ruins every smoothie I don't
like ginger I think so but it's just a

7078
02:25:49,610 --> 02:25:49,620
like ginger I think so but it's just a
 

7079
02:25:49,620 --> 02:25:50,990
like ginger I think so but it's just a
personal thing and also I don't like

7080
02:25:50,990 --> 02:25:51,000
personal thing and also I don't like
 

7081
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:54,230
personal thing and also I don't like
cinnamon but um oh the ginger has a

7082
02:25:54,230 --> 02:25:54,240
cinnamon but um oh the ginger has a
 

7083
02:25:54,240 --> 02:25:55,610
cinnamon but um oh the ginger has a
cinnamony taste because I thought Ginger

7084
02:25:55,610 --> 02:25:55,620
cinnamony taste because I thought Ginger
 

7085
02:25:55,620 --> 02:25:57,290
cinnamony taste because I thought Ginger
no I don't think they do but I I also

7086
02:25:57,290 --> 02:25:57,300
no I don't think they do but I I also
 

7087
02:25:57,300 --> 02:25:59,330
no I don't think they do but I I also
don't like they add in a lot of

7088
02:25:59,330 --> 02:25:59,340
don't like they add in a lot of
 

7089
02:25:59,340 --> 02:26:02,270
don't like they add in a lot of
smoothies I was forced a smoothie I went

7090
02:26:02,270 --> 02:26:02,280
smoothies I was forced a smoothie I went
 

7091
02:26:02,280 --> 02:26:03,830
smoothies I was forced a smoothie I went
to Malibu with a good friend of mine

7092
02:26:03,830 --> 02:26:03,840
to Malibu with a good friend of mine
 

7093
02:26:03,840 --> 02:26:05,630
to Malibu with a good friend of mine
damn Reynolds and he forced me to

7094
02:26:05,630 --> 02:26:05,640
damn Reynolds and he forced me to
 

7095
02:26:05,640 --> 02:26:08,210
damn Reynolds and he forced me to
consume a smoothie and you know it's

7096
02:26:08,210 --> 02:26:08,220
consume a smoothie and you know it's
 

7097
02:26:08,220 --> 02:26:09,469
consume a smoothie and you know it's
probably the first smoothie I've ever

7098
02:26:09,469 --> 02:26:09,479
probably the first smoothie I've ever
 

7099
02:26:09,479 --> 02:26:11,690
probably the first smoothie I've ever
had because I've always had was very

7100
02:26:11,690 --> 02:26:11,700
had because I've always had was very
 

7101
02:26:11,700 --> 02:26:13,429
had because I've always had was very
judgmental of the kind of places and

7102
02:26:13,429 --> 02:26:13,439
judgmental of the kind of places and
 

7103
02:26:13,439 --> 02:26:15,170
judgmental of the kind of places and
people that drink smoothies but it was

7104
02:26:15,170 --> 02:26:15,180
people that drink smoothies but it was
 

7105
02:26:15,180 --> 02:26:17,030
people that drink smoothies but it was
good it was good well smoothie is very

7106
02:26:17,030 --> 02:26:17,040
good it was good well smoothie is very
 

7107
02:26:17,040 --> 02:26:18,830
good it was good well smoothie is very
American so I yeah it is an American

7108
02:26:18,830 --> 02:26:18,840
American so I yeah it is an American
 

7109
02:26:18,840 --> 02:26:21,110
American so I yeah it is an American
thing I wouldn't say success per se but

7110
02:26:21,110 --> 02:26:21,120
thing I wouldn't say success per se but
 

7111
02:26:21,120 --> 02:26:23,870
thing I wouldn't say success per se but
it is true that's when you dance at the

7112
02:26:23,870 --> 02:26:23,880
it is true that's when you dance at the
 

7113
02:26:23,880 --> 02:26:25,429
it is true that's when you dance at the
edge of different disciplines that

7114
02:26:25,429 --> 02:26:25,439
edge of different disciplines that
 

7115
02:26:25,439 --> 02:26:27,130
edge of different disciplines that
that's when the

7116
02:26:27,130 --> 02:26:27,140
that's when the
 

7117
02:26:27,140 --> 02:26:29,389
that's when the
inevitably you know Innovation will rise

7118
02:26:29,389 --> 02:26:29,399
inevitably you know Innovation will rise
 

7119
02:26:29,399 --> 02:26:31,790
inevitably you know Innovation will rise
because you will see things

7120
02:26:31,790 --> 02:26:31,800
because you will see things
 

7121
02:26:31,800 --> 02:26:33,770
because you will see things
um maybe a little differently when

7122
02:26:33,770 --> 02:26:33,780
um maybe a little differently when
 

7123
02:26:33,780 --> 02:26:36,710
um maybe a little differently when
you're on the edge right so

7124
02:26:36,710 --> 02:26:36,720
you're on the edge right so
 

7125
02:26:36,720 --> 02:26:39,590
you're on the edge right so
but it will probably take longer and it

7126
02:26:39,590 --> 02:26:39,600
but it will probably take longer and it
 

7127
02:26:39,600 --> 02:26:41,929
but it will probably take longer and it
may not be understood right away it may

7128
02:26:41,929 --> 02:26:41,939
may not be understood right away it may
 

7129
02:26:41,939 --> 02:26:45,950
may not be understood right away it may
not come into final form quickly given

7130
02:26:45,950 --> 02:26:45,960
not come into final form quickly given
 

7131
02:26:45,960 --> 02:26:50,150
not come into final form quickly given
that it is a new

7132
02:26:50,150 --> 02:26:50,160

 

7133
02:26:50,160 --> 02:26:53,990

concept Rising so therefore the patients

7134
02:26:53,990 --> 02:26:54,000
concept Rising so therefore the patients
 

7135
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:56,090
concept Rising so therefore the patients
will make more sense I'm sorry patients

7136
02:26:56,090 --> 02:26:56,100
will make more sense I'm sorry patients
 

7137
02:26:56,100 --> 02:26:58,010
will make more sense I'm sorry patients
will be even more important so if you

7138
02:26:58,010 --> 02:26:58,020
will be even more important so if you
 

7139
02:26:58,020 --> 02:26:59,090
will be even more important so if you
are

7140
02:26:59,090 --> 02:26:59,100
are
 

7141
02:26:59,100 --> 02:27:01,250
are

saying that don't go to bed
 

7211

full if you're the neighbor is hungry

full if you're the neighbor is hungry
 

7213
02:28:29,819 --> 02:28:32,690
full if you're the neighbor is hungry
so you know you wouldn't

7214
02:28:32,690 --> 02:28:32,700
so you know you wouldn't
 

7215
02:28:32,700 --> 02:28:35,210
so you know you wouldn't
eat any food in front of someone where I

7216
02:28:35,210 --> 02:28:35,220
eat any food in front of someone where I
 

7217
02:28:35,220 --> 02:28:38,090
eat any food in front of someone where I
come from without offering to share the

7218
02:28:38,090 --> 02:28:38,100
come from without offering to share the
 

7219
02:28:38,100 --> 02:28:40,070
come from without offering to share the
bite so I think those things however

7220
02:28:40,070 --> 02:28:40,080
bite so I think those things however
 

7221
02:28:40,080 --> 02:28:42,590
bite so I think those things however
small they may sound

7222
02:28:42,590 --> 02:28:42,600
small they may sound
 

7223
02:28:42,600 --> 02:28:45,910
small they may sound
um a really big deal especially when you

7224
02:28:45,910 --> 02:28:45,920
um a really big deal especially when you
 

7225
02:28:45,920 --> 02:28:49,130
um a really big deal especially when you
are put in a or move to a place that may

7226
02:28:49,130 --> 02:28:49,140
are put in a or move to a place that may
 

7227
02:28:49,140 --> 02:28:50,929
are put in a or move to a place that may
not have those attributes

02:28:50,929 --> 02:28:50,939
not have those attributes
 

7229
02:28:50,939 --> 02:28:53,090
not have those attributes
so I think that
